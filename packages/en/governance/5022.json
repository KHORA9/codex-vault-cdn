While the different branches of the Government are to a\r\ncertain extent independent of each other, the duties of all alike have\r\ndirect reference to the source of power. Fortunately, under this system no\r\nman is so high and none so humble in the scale of public station as to\r\nescape from the scrutiny or to be exempt from the responsibility which all\r\nofficial functions imply.\r\n\r\nUpon the justice and intelligence of the masses, in a government thus\r\norganized, is the sole reliance of the confederacy and the only security\r\nfor honest and earnest devotion to its interests against the usurpations\r\nand encroachment of power on the one hand and the assaults of personal\r\nambition on the other.\r\n\r\nThe interest of which I have spoken is inseparable from an inquiring,\r\nself-governing community, but stimulated, doubtless, at the present time by\r\nthe unsettled condition of our relations with several foreign powers, by\r\nthe new obligations resulting from a sudden extension of the field of\r\nenterprise, by the spirit with which that field has been entered and the\r\namazing energy with which its resources for meeting the demands of humanity\r\nhave been developed.\r\n\r\nAlthough disease, assuming at one time the characteristics of a widespread\r\nand devastating pestilence, has left its sad traces upon some portions of\r\nour country, we have still the most abundant cause for reverent\r\nthankfulness to God for an accumulation of signal mercies showered upon us\r\nas a nation. It is well that a consciousness of rapid advancement and\r\nincreasing strength be habitually associated with an abiding sense of\r\ndependence upon Him who holds in His hands the destiny of men and of\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nRecognizing the wisdom of the broad principle of absolute religious\r\ntoleration proclaimed in our fundamental law, and rejoicing in the benign\r\ninfluence which it has exerted upon our social and political condition, I\r\nshould shrink from a clear duty did I fail to express my deepest conviction\r\nthat we can place no secure reliance upon any apparent progress if it be\r\nnot sustained by national integrity, resting upon the great truths affirmed\r\nand illustrated by divine revelation. In the midst of our sorrow for the\r\nafflicted and suffering, it has been consoling to see how promptly disaster\r\nmade true neighbors of districts and cities separated widely from each\r\nother, and cheering to watch the strength of that common bond of\r\nbrotherhood which unites all hearts, in all parts of this Union, when\r\ndanger threatens from abroad or calamity impends over us at home.\r\n\r\nOur diplomatic relations with foreign powers have undergone no essential\r\nchange since the adjournment of the last Congress. With some of them\r\nquestions of a disturbing character are still pending, but there are good\r\nreasons to believe that these may all be amicably adjusted. For some years\r\npast Great Britain has so construed the first article of the convention of\r\nthe 20th of April, 1818, in regard to the fisheries on the northeastern\r\ncoast, as to exclude our citizens from some of the fishing grounds to which\r\nthey freely resorted for nearly a quarter of a century subsequent to the\r\ndate of that treaty. The United States have never acquiesced in this\r\nconstruction, but have always claimed for their fishermen all the rights\r\nwhich they had so long enjoyed without molestation. With a view to remove\r\nall difficulties on the subject, to extend the rights of our fishermen\r\nbeyond the limits fixed by the convention of 1818, and to regulate trade\r\nbetween the United States and the British North American Provinces, a\r\nnegotiation has been opened with a fair prospect of a favorable result. To\r\nprotect our fishermen in the enjoyment of their rights and prevent\r\ncollision between them and British fishermen, I deemed it expedient to\r\nstation a naval force in that quarter during the fishing season.\r\n\r\nEmbarrassing questions have also arisen between the two Governments in\r\nregard to Central America. Great Britain has proposed to settle them by an\r\namicable arrangement, and our minister at London is instructed to enter\r\ninto negotiations on that subject. A commission for adjusting the claims of\r\nour citizens against Great Britain and those of British subjects against\r\nthe United States, organized under the convention of the 8th of February\r\nlast, is now sitting in London for the transaction of business. It is in\r\nmany respects desirable that the boundary line between the United States\r\nand the British Provinces in the northwest, as designated in the convention\r\nof the 15th of June, 1846, and especially that part which separates the\r\nTerritory of Washington from the British possessions on the north, should\r\nbe traced and marked. I therefore present the subject to your notice.\r\n\r\nWith France our relations continue on the most friendly footing. The\r\nextensive commerce between the United States and that country might, it is\r\nconceived, be released from some unnecessary restrictions to the mutual\r\nadvantage of both parties. With a view to this object, some progress has\r\nbeen made in negotiating a treaty of commerce and navigation.\r\n\r\nIndependently of our valuable trade with Spain, we have important political\r\nrelations with her growing out of our neighborhood to the islands of Cuba\r\nand Porto Rico. I am happy to announce that since the last Congress no\r\nattempts have been made by unauthorized expeditions within the United\r\nStates against either of those colonies. Should any movement be manifested\r\nwithin our limits, all the means at my command will be vigorously exerted\r\nto repress it. Several annoying occurrences have taken place at Havana, or\r\nin the vicinity of the island of Cuba, between our citizens and the Spanish\r\nauthorities. Considering the proximity of that island to our shores, lying,\r\nas it does, in the track of trade between some of our principal cities, and\r\nthe suspicious vigilance with which foreign intercourse, particularly that\r\nwith the United States, is there guarded, a repetition of such occurrences\r\nmay well be apprehended.\r\n\r\nAs no diplomatic intercourse is allowed between our consul at Havana and\r\nthe Captain-General of Cuba, ready explanations can not be made or prompt\r\nredress afforded where injury has resulted. All complaint on the part of\r\nour citizens under the present arrangement must be, in the first place,\r\npresented to this Government and then referred to Spain. Spain again refers\r\nit to her local authorities in Cuba for investigation, and postpones an\r\nanswer till she has heard from those authorities. To avoid these irritating\r\nand vexatious delays, a proposition has been made to provide for a direct\r\nappeal for redress to the Captain-General by our consul in behalf of our\r\ninjured fellow-citizens. Hitherto the Government of Spain has declined to\r\nenter into any such arrangement. This course on her part is deeply\r\nregretted, for without some arrangement of this kind the good understanding\r\nbetween the two countries may be exposed to occasional interruption. Our\r\nminister at Madrid is instructed to renew the proposition and to press it\r\nagain upon the consideration of Her Catholic Majesty's Government.\r\n\r\nFor several years Spain has been calling the attention of this Government\r\nto a claim for losses by some of her subjects in the case of the schooner\r\nAmistad. This claim is believed to rest on the obligations imposed by our\r\nexisting treaty with that country. Its justice was admitted in our\r\ndiplomatic correspondence with the Spanish Government as early as March,\r\n1847, and one of my predecessors, in his annual message of that year,\r\nrecommended that provision should be made for its payment. In January last\r\nit was again submitted to Congress by the Executive. It has received a\r\nfavorable consideration by committees of both branches, but as yet there\r\nhas been no final action upon it. I conceive that good faith requires its\r\nprompt adjustment, and I present it to your early and favorable\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nMartin Koszta, a Hungarian by birth, came to this country in 1850, and\r\ndeclared his intention in due form of law to become a citizen of the United\r\nStates. After remaining here nearly two years he visited Turkey. While at\r\nSmyrna he was forcibly seized, taken on board an Austrian brig of war then\r\nlying in the harbor of that place, and there confined in irons, with the\r\navowed design to take him into the dominions of Austria. Our consul at\r\nSmyrna and legation at Constantinople interposed for his release, but their\r\nefforts were ineffectual. While thus in prison Commander Ingraham, with the\r\nUnited States ship of war St. Louis, arrived at Smyrna, and after inquiring\r\ninto the circumstances of the case came to the conclusion that Koszta was\r\nentitled to the protection of this Government, and took energetic and\r\nprompt measures for his release. Under an arrangement between the agents of\r\nthe United States and of Austria, he was transferred to the custody of the\r\nFrench consul-general at Smyrna, there to remain until he should be\r\ndisposed of by the mutual agreement of the consuls of the respective\r\nGovernments at that place. Pursuant to that agreement, he has been\r\nreleased, and is now in the United States. The Emperor of Austria has made\r\nthe conduct of our officers who took part in this transaction a subject of\r\ngrave complaint. Regarding Koszta as still his subject, and claiming a\r\nright to seize him within the limits of the Turkish Empire, he has demanded\r\nof this Government its consent to the surrender of the prisoner, a\r\ndisavowal of the acts of its agents, and satisfaction for the alleged\r\noutrage. After a careful consideration of the case I came to the conclusion\r\nthat Koszta was seized without legal authority at Smyrna; that he was\r\nwrongfully detained on board of the Austrian brig of war; that at the time\r\nof his seizure he was clothed with the nationality of the United States,\r\nand that the acts of our officers, under the circumstances of the case,\r\nwere justifiable, and their conduct has been fully approved by me, and a\r\ncompliance with the several demands of the Emperor of Austria has been\r\ndeclined.\r\n\r\nFor a more full account of this transaction and my views in regard to it I\r\nrefer to the correspondence between the charge d'affaires of Austria and\r\nthe Secretary of State, which is herewith transmitted. The principles and\r\npolicy therein maintained on the part of the United States will, whenever a\r\nproper occasion occurs, be applied and enforced.\r\n\r\nThe condition of China at this time renders it probable that some important\r\nchanges will occur in that vast Empire which will lead to a more\r\nunrestricted intercourse with it. The commissioner to that country who has\r\nbeen recently appointed is instructed to avail himself of all occasions to\r\nopen and extend our commercial relations, not only with the Empire of\r\nChina, but with other Asiatic nations.\r\n\r\nIn 1852 an expedition was sent to Japan, under the command of Commodore\r\nPerry, for the purpose of opening commercial intercourse with that Empire.\r\nIntelligence has been received of his arrival there and of his having made\r\nknown to the Emperor of Japan the object of his visit. But it is not yet\r\nascertained how far the Emperor will be disposed to abandon his restrictive\r\npolicy and open that populous country to a commercial intercourse with the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nIt has been my earnest desire to maintain friendly intercourse with the\r\nGovernments upon this continent and to aid them in preserving good\r\nunderstanding among themselves. With Mexico a dispute has arisen as to the\r\ntrue boundary line between our Territory of New Mexico and the Mexican\r\nState of Chihuahua. A former commissioner of the United States, employed in\r\nrunning that line pursuant to the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, made a\r\nserious mistake in determining the initial point on the Rio Grande; but\r\ninasmuch as his decision was clearly a departure from the directions for\r\ntracing the boundary contained in that treaty, and was not concurred in by\r\nthe surveyor appointed on the part of the United States, whose concurrence\r\nwas necessary to give validity to that decision, this Government is not\r\nconcluded thereby; but that of Mexico takes a different view of the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nThere are also other questions of considerable magnitude pending between\r\nthe two Republics. Our minister in Mexico has ample instructions to adjust\r\nthem. Negotiations have been opened, but sufficient progress has not been\r\nmade therein to enable me to speak of the probable result. Impressed with\r\nthe importance of maintaining amicable relations with that Republic and of\r\nyielding with liberality to all her just claims, it is reasonable to expect\r\nthat an arrangement mutually satisfactory to both countries may be\r\nconcluded and a lasting friendship between them confirmed and perpetuated.\r\n\r\nCongress having provided for a full mission to the States of Central\r\nAmerica, a minister was sent thither in July last. As yet he has had time\r\nto visit only one of these States (Nicaragua), where he was received in the\r\nmost friendly manner. It is hoped that his presence and good offices will\r\nhave a benign effect in composing the dissensions which prevail among them,\r\nand in establishing still more intimate and friendly relations between them\r\nrespectively and between each of them and the United States.\r\n\r\nConsidering the vast regions of this continent and the number of states\r\nwhich would be made accessible by the free navigation of the river Amazon,\r\nparticular attention has been given to this subject. Brazil, through whose\r\nterritories it passes into the ocean, has hitherto persisted in a policy so\r\nrestricted in regard to the use of this river as to obstruct and nearly\r\nexclude foreign commercial intercourse with the States which lie upon its\r\ntributaries and upper branches. Our minister to that country is instructed\r\nto obtain a relaxation of that policy and to use his efforts to induce the\r\nBrazilian Government to open to common use, under proper safeguards, this\r\ngreat natural highway for international trade. Several of the South\r\nAmerican States are deeply interested in this attempt to secure the free\r\nnavigation of the Amazon, and it is reasonable to expect their cooperation\r\nin the measure. As the advantages of free commercial intercourse among\r\nnations are better understood, more liberal views are generally entertained\r\nas to the common rights of all to the free use of those means which nature\r\nhas provided for international communication. To these more liberal and\r\nenlightened views it is hoped that Brazil will conform her policy and\r\nremove all unnecessary restrictions upon the free use of a river which\r\ntraverses so many states and so large a part of the continent. I am happy\r\nto inform you that the Republic of Paraguay and the Argentine Confederation\r\nhave yielded to the liberal policy still resisted by Brazil in regard to\r\nthe navigable rivers within their respective territories. Treaties\r\nembracing this subject, among others, have been negotiated with these\r\nGovernments, which will be submitted to the Senate at the present session.\r\n\r\nA new branch of commerce, important to the agricultural interests of the\r\nUnited States, has within a few years past been opened with Peru.\r\nNotwithstanding the inexhaustible deposits of guano upon the islands of\r\nthat country, considerable difficulties are experienced in obtaining the\r\nrequisite supply. Measures have been taken to remove these difficulties and\r\nto secure a more abundant importation of the article. Unfortunately, there\r\nhas been a serious collision between our citizens who have resorted to the\r\nChincha Islands for it and the Peruvian authorities stationed there.\r\nRedress for the outrages committed by the latter was promptly demanded by\r\nour minister at Lima. This subject is now under consideration, and there is\r\nreason to believe that Peru is disposed to offer adequate indemnity to the\r\naggrieved parties. We are thus not only at peace with all foreign\r\ncountries, but, in regard to political affairs, are exempt from any cause\r\nof serious disquietude in our domestic relations.\r\n\r\nThe controversies which have agitated the country heretofore are passing\r\naway with the causes which produced them and the passions which they had\r\nawakened; or, if any trace of them remains, it may be reasonably hoped that\r\nit will only be perceived in the zealous rivalry of all good citizens to\r\ntestify their respect for the rights of the States, their devotion to the\r\nUnion, and their common determination that each one of the States, its\r\ninstitutions, its welfare, and its domestic peace, shall be held alike\r\nsecure under the sacred aegis of the Constitution. This new league of amity\r\nand of mutual confidence and support into which the people of the Republic\r\nhave entered happily affords inducement and opportunity for the adoption of\r\na more comprehensive and unembarrassed line of policy and action as to the\r\ngreat material interests of the country, whether regarded in themselves or\r\nin connection with the powers of the civilized world.\r\n\r\nThe United States have continued gradually and steadily to expand through\r\nacquisitions of territory, which, how much soever some of them may have\r\nbeen questioned, are now universally seen and admitted to have been wise in\r\npolicy, just in character, and a great element in the advancement of our\r\ncountry, and with it of the human race, in freedom, in prosperity, and in\r\nhappiness. The thirteen States have grown to be thirty-one, with relations\r\nreaching to Europe on the one side and on the other to the distant realms\r\nof Asia.\r\n\r\nI am deeply sensible of the immense responsibility which the present\r\nmagnitude of the Republic and the diversity and multiplicity of its\r\ninterests devolves upon me, the alleviation of which so far as relates to\r\nthe immediate conduct of the public business, is, first, in my reliance on\r\nthe wisdom and patriotism of the two Houses of Congress, and, secondly, in\r\nthe directions afforded me by the principles of public polity affirmed by\r\nour fathers of the epoch of 1798, sanctioned by long experience, and\r\nconsecrated anew by the overwhelming voice of the people of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nRecurring to these principles, which constitute the organic basis of union,\r\nwe perceive that vast as are the functions and the duties of the Federal\r\nGovernment, vested in or intrusted to its three great departments--the\r\nlegislative, executive, and judicial--yet the substantive power, the\r\npopular force, and the large capacities for social and material development\r\nexist in the respective States, which, all being of themselves\r\nwell-constituted republics, as they preceded so they alone are capable of\r\nmaintaining and perpetuating the American Union. The Federal Government has\r\nits appropriate line of action in the specific and limited powers conferred\r\non it by the Constitution, chiefly as to those things in which the States\r\nhave a common interest in their relations to one another and to foreign\r\ngovernments, while the great mass of interests which belong to cultivated\r\nmen--the ordinary business of life, the springs of industry, all the\r\ndiversified personal and domestic affairs of society--rest securely upon\r\nthe general reserved powers of the people of the several States. There is\r\nthe effective democracy of the nation, and there the vital essence of its\r\nbeing and its greatness.\r\n\r\nOf the practical consequences which flow from the nature of the Federal\r\nGovernment, the primary one is the duty of administering with integrity and\r\nfidelity the high trust reposed in it by the Constitution, especially in\r\nthe application of the public funds as drawn by taxation from the people\r\nand appropriated to specific objects by Congress.\r\n\r\nHappily, I have no occasion to suggest any radical changes in the financial\r\npolicy of the Government. Ours is almost, if not absolutely, the solitary\r\npower of Christendom having a surplus revenue drawn immediately from\r\nimposts on commerce, and therefore measured by the spontaneous enterprise\r\nand national prosperity of the country, with such indirect relation to\r\nagriculture, manufactures, and the products of the earth and sea as to\r\nviolate no constitutional doctrine and yet vigorously promote the general\r\nwelfare. Neither as to the sources of the public treasure nor as to the\r\nmanner of keeping and managing it does any grave controversy now prevail,\r\nthere being a general acquiescence in the wisdom of the present system.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Treasury will exhibit in detail the\r\nstate of the public finances and the condition of the various branches of\r\nthe public service administered by that Department of the Government.\r\n\r\nThe revenue of the country, levied almost insensibly to the taxpayer, goes\r\non from year to year, increasing beyond either the interests or the\r\nprospective wants of the Government.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the fiscal year ending June 30, 1852, there remained in the\r\nTreasury a balance of $14,632,136. The public revenue for the fiscal year\r\nending June 30, 1853, amounted to $58,931,865 from customs and to\r\n$2,405,708 from public lands and other miscellaneous sources, amounting\r\ntogether to $61,337,574, while the public expenditures for the same period,\r\nexclusive of payments on account of the public debt, amounted to\r\n$43,554,262, leaving a balance of $32,425,447 of receipts above\r\nexpenditures.\r\n\r\nThis fact of increasing surplus in the Treasury became the subject of\r\nanxious consideration at a very early period of my Administration, and the\r\npath of duty in regard to it seemed to me obvious and clear, namely: First,\r\nto apply the surplus revenue to the discharge of the public debt so far as\r\nit could judiciously be done, and, secondly, to devise means for the\r\ngradual reduction of the revenue to the standard of the public exigencies.\r\n\r\nOf these objects the first has been in the course of accomplishment in a\r\nmanner and to a degree highly satisfactory. The amount of the public debt\r\nof all classes was on the 4th of March, 1853, $69,190,037, payments on\r\naccount of which have been made since that period to the amount of\r\n$12,703,329, leaving unpaid and in continuous course of liquidation the sum\r\nof $56,486,708. These payments, although made at the market price of the\r\nrespective classes of stocks, have been effected readily and to the general\r\nadvantage of the Treasury, and have at the same time proved of signal\r\nutility in the relief they have incidentally afforded to the money market\r\nand to the industrial and commercial pursuits of the country.\r\n\r\nThe second of the above-mentioned objects, that of the reduction of the\r\ntariff, is of great importance, and the plan suggested by the Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury, which is to reduce the duties on certain articles and to add\r\nto the free list many articles now taxed, and especially such as enter into\r\nmanufactures and are not largely, or at all, produced in the country, is\r\ncommended to your candid and careful consideration.\r\n\r\nYou will find in the report of the Secretary of the Treasury, also,\r\nabundant proof of the entire adequacy of the present fiscal system to meet\r\nall the requirements of the public service, and that, while properly\r\nadministered, it operates to the advantage of the community in ordinary\r\nbusiness relations.\r\n\r\nI respectfully ask your attention to sundry suggestions of improvements in\r\nthe settlement of accounts, especially as regards the large sums of\r\noutstanding arrears due to the Government, and of other reforms in the\r\nadministrative action of his Department which are indicated by the\r\nSecretary; as also to the progress made in the construction of marine\r\nhospitals, custom-houses, and of a new mint in California and assay office\r\nin the city of New York, heretofore provided for by Congress, and also to\r\nthe eminently successful progress of the Coast Survey and of the Light\r\nHouse Board.\r\n\r\nAmong the objects meriting your attention will be important recommendations\r\nfrom the Secretaries of War and Navy. I am fully satisfied that the Navy of\r\nthe United States is not in a condition of strength and efficiency\r\ncommensurate with the magnitude of our commercial and other interests, and\r\ncommend to your especial attention the suggestions on this subject made by\r\nthe Secretary of the Navy. I respectfully submit that the Army, which under\r\nour system must always be regarded with the highest interest as a nucleus\r\naround which the volunteer forces of the nation gather in the hour of\r\ndanger, requires augmentation, or modification, to adapt it to the present\r\nextended limits and frontier relations of the country and the condition of\r\nthe Indian tribes in the interior of the continent, the necessity of which\r\nwill appear in the communications of the Secretaries of War and the\r\nInterior.\r\n\r\nIn the administration of the Post-Office Department for the fiscal year\r\nending June 30, 1853, the gross expenditure was $7,982,756, and the gross\r\nreceipts during the same period $5,942,734, showing that the current\r\nrevenue failed to meet the current expenses of the Department by the sum of\r\n$2,042,032. The causes which, under the present postal system and laws, led\r\ninevitably to this result are fully explained by the report of the\r\nPostmaster-General, one great cause being the enormous rates the Department\r\nhas been compelled to pay for mail service rendered by railroad companies.\r\n\r\nThe exhibit in the report of the Postmaster-General of the income and\r\nexpenditures by mail steamers will be found peculiarly interesting and of a\r\ncharacter to demand the immediate action of Congress.\r\n\r\nNumerous and flagrant frauds upon the Pension Bureau have been brought to\r\nlight within the last year, and in some instances merited punishments\r\ninflicted; but, unfortunately, in others guilty parties have escaped, not\r\nthrough the want of sufficient evidence to warrant a conviction, but in\r\nconsequence of the provisions of limitation in the existing laws.\r\n\r\nFrom the nature of these claims, the remoteness of the tribunals to pass\r\nupon them, and the mode in which the proof is of necessity furnished,\r\ntemptations to crime have been greatly stimulated by the obvious\r\ndifficulties of detection. The defects in the law upon this subject are so\r\napparent and so fatal to the ends of justice that your early action\r\nrelating to it is most desirable.\r\n\r\nDuring the last fiscal year 9,819,411 acres of the public lands have been\r\nsurveyed and 10,363,891 acres brought into market. Within the same period\r\nthe sales by public purchase and private entry amounted to 1,083,495 acres;\r\nlocated under military bountys and warrants, 6,142,360 acres; located under\r\nother certificates, 9,427 acres; ceded to the States as swamp lands,\r\n16,684,253 acres; selected for railroad and other objects under acts of\r\nCongress, 1,427,457 acres: total amount of lands disposed of within the\r\nfiscal year, 25,346,992 acres, which is an increase in quantity sold and\r\nlocated under land warrants and grants of 12,231, 818 acres over the fiscal\r\nyear immediately preceding. The quantity of land sold during the second and\r\nthird quarters of 1852 was 334,451 acres; the amount received therefor was\r\n$623,687. The quantity sold the second and third quarters of the year 1853\r\nwas 1,609,919 acres, and the amount received therefor $2,226,876.\r\n\r\nThe whole number of land warrants issued under existing laws prior to the\r\n30th of September last was 266,042, of which there were outstanding at that\r\ndate 66,947. The quantity of land required to satisfy these outstanding\r\nwarrants is 4,778,120 acres. Warrants have been issued to 30th of September\r\nlast under the act of 11th February, 1847, calling for 12,879,280 acres,\r\nunder acts of September 28, 1850, and March 22, 1852, calling for\r\n12,505,360 acres, making a total of 25,384,640 acres.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that experience has verified the wisdom and justice of the\r\npresent system with regard to the public domain in most essential\r\nparticulars.\r\n\r\nYou will perceive from the report of the Secretary of the Interior that\r\nopinions which have often been expressed in relation to the operation of\r\nthe land system as not being a source of revenue to the Federal Treasury\r\nwere erroneous. The net profits from the sale of the public lands to June\r\n30, 1853, amounted to the sum of $53,289,465.\r\n\r\nI recommend the extension of the land system over the Territories of Utah\r\nand New Mexico, with such modifications as their peculiarities may\r\nrequire.\r\n\r\nRegarding our public domain as chiefly valuable to provide homes for the\r\nindustrious and enterprising, I am not prepared to recommend any essential\r\nchange in the land system, except by modifications in favor of the actual\r\nsettler and an extension of the preemption principle in certain cases, for\r\nreasons and on grounds which will be fully developed in the reports to be\r\nlaid before you.\r\n\r\nCongress, representing the proprietors of the territorial domain and\r\ncharged especially with power to dispose of territory belonging to the\r\nUnited States, has for a long course of years, beginning with the\r\nAdministration of Mr. Jefferson, exercised the power to construct roads\r\nwithin the Territories, and there are so many and obvious distinctions\r\nbetween this exercise of power and that of making roads within the States\r\nthat the former has never been considered subject to such objections as\r\napply to the latter; and such may now be considered the settled\r\nconstruction of the power of the Federal Government upon the subject.\r\n\r\nNumerous applications have been and no doubt will continue to be made for\r\ngrants of land in aid of the construction of railways. It is not believed\r\nto be within the intent and meaning of the Constitution that the power to\r\ndispose of the public domain should be used otherwise than might be\r\nexpected from a prudent proprietor and therefore that grants of land to aid\r\nin the construction of roads should be restricted to cases where it would\r\nbe for the interest of a proprietor under like circumstances thus to\r\ncontribute to the construction of these works. For the practical operation\r\nof such grants thus far in advancing the interests of the States in which\r\nthe works are located, and at the same time the substantial interests of\r\nall the other States, by enhancing the value and promoting the rapid sale\r\nof the public domain, I refer you to the report of the Secretary of the\r\nInterior. A careful examination, however, will show that this experience is\r\nthe result of a just discrimination and will be far from affording\r\nencouragement to a reckless or indiscriminate extension of the principle.\r\n\r\nI commend to your favorable consideration the men of genius of our country\r\nwho by their inventions and discoveries in science and arts have\r\ncontributed largely to the improvements of the age without, in many\r\ninstances, securing for themselves anything like an adequate reward. For\r\nmany interesting details upon this subject I refer you to the appropriate\r\nreports, and especially urge upon your early attention the apparently\r\nslight, but really important, modifications of existing laws therein\r\nsuggested.\r\n\r\nThe liberal spirit which has so long marked the action of Congress in\r\nrelation to the District of Columbia will, I have no doubt, continue to be\r\nmanifested.\r\n\r\nThe erection of an asylum for the insane of the District of Columbia and of\r\nthe Army and Navy of the United States has been somewhat retarded by the\r\ngreat demand for materials and labor during the past summer, but full\r\npreparation for the reception of patients before the return of another\r\nwinter is anticipated; and there is the best reason to believe, from the\r\nplan and contemplated arrangements which have been devised, with the large\r\nexperience furnished within the last few years in relation to the nature\r\nand treatment of the disease, that it will prove an asylum indeed to this\r\nmost helpless and afflicted class of sufferers and stand as a noble\r\nmonument of wisdom and mercy. Under the acts of Congress of August 31,\r\n1852, and of March 3, 1853, designed to secure for the cities of Washington\r\nand Georgetown an abundant supply of good and wholesome water, it became my\r\nduty to examine the report and plans of the engineer who had charge of the\r\nsurveys under the act first named. The best, if not the only, plan\r\ncalculated to secure permanently the object sought was that which\r\ncontemplates taking the water from the Great Falls of the Potomac, and\r\nconsequently I gave to it my approval.\r\n\r\nFor the progress and present condition of this important work and for its\r\ndemands so far as appropriations are concerned I refer you to the report of\r\nthe Secretary of War.\r\n\r\nThe present judicial system of the United States has now been in operation\r\nfor so long a period of time and has in its general theory and much of its\r\ndetails become so familiar to the country and acquired so entirely the\r\npublic confidence that if modified in any respect it should only be in\r\nthose particulars which may adapt it to the increased extent, population,\r\nand legal business of the United States. In this relation the organization\r\nof the courts is now confessedly inadequate to the duties to be performed\r\nby them, in consequence of which the States of Florida, Wisconsin, Iowa,\r\nTexas, and California, and districts of other States, are in effect\r\nexcluded from the full benefits of the general system by the functions of\r\nthe circuit court being devolved on the district judges in all those States\r\nor parts of States. The spirit of the Constitution and a due regard to\r\njustice require that all the States of the Union should be placed on the\r\nsame footing in regard to the judicial tribunals. I therefore commend to\r\nyour consideration this important subject, which in my judgment demands the\r\nspeedy action of Congress. I will present to you, if deemed desirable, a\r\nplan which I am prepared to recommend for the enlargement and modification\r\nof the present judicial system.\r\n\r\nThe act of Congress establishing the Smithsonian Institution provided that\r\nthe President of the United States and other persons therein designated\r\nshould constitute an \"establishment\" by that name, and that the members\r\nshould hold stated and special meetings for the supervision of the affairs\r\nof the Institution. The organization not having taken place, it seemed to\r\nme proper that it should be effected without delay. This has been done; and\r\nan occasion was thereby presented for inspecting the condition of the\r\nInstitution and appreciating its successful progress thus far and its high\r\npromise of great and general usefulness.\r\n\r\nI have omitted to ask your favorable consideration for the estimates of\r\nworks of a local character in twenty-seven of the thirty-one States,\r\namounting to $1,754,500, because, independently of the grounds which have\r\nso often been urged against the application of the Federal revenue for\r\nworks of this character, inequality, with consequent injustice, is inherent\r\nin the nature of the proposition, and because the plan has proved entirely\r\ninadequate to the accomplishment of the objects sought.\r\n\r\nThe subject of internal improvements, claiming alike the interest and good\r\nwill of all, has, nevertheless, been the basis of much political discussion\r\nand has stood as a deep-graven line of division between statesmen of\r\neminent ability and patriotism. The rule of strict construction of all\r\npowers delegated by the States to the General Government has arrayed itself\r\nfrom time to time against the rapid progress of expenditures from the\r\nNational Treasury on works of a local character within the States.\r\nMemorable as an epoch in the history of this subject is the message of\r\nPresident Jackson of the 27th of May, 1830, which met the system of\r\ninternal improvements in its comparative infancy; but so rapid had been its\r\ngrowth that the projected appropriations in that year for works of this\r\ncharacter had risen to the alarming amount of more than $100,000,000\r\n\r\nIn that message the President admitted the difficulty of bringing back the\r\noperations of the Government to the construction of the Constitution set up\r\nin 1798, and marked it as an admonitory proof of the necessity of guarding\r\nthat instrument with sleepless vigilance against the authority of\r\nprecedents which had not the sanction of its most plainly defined powers.\r\n\r\nOur Government exists under a written compact between sovereign States,\r\nuniting for specific objects and with specific grants to their general\r\nagent. If, then, in the progress of its administration there have been\r\ndepartures from the terms and intent of the compact, it is and will ever be\r\nproper to refer back to the fixed standard which our fathers left us and to\r\nmake a stern effort to conform our action to it. It would seem that the\r\nfact of a principle having been resisted from the first by many of the\r\nwisest and most patriotic men of the Republic, and a policy having provoked\r\nconstant strife without arriving at a conclusion which can be regarded as\r\nsatisfactory to its most earnest advocates, should suggest the inquiry\r\nwhether there may not be a plan likely to be crowned by happier results.\r\nWithout perceiving any sound distinction or intending to assert any\r\nprinciple as opposed to improvements needed for the protection of internal\r\ncommerce which does not equally apply to improvements upon the seaboard for\r\nthe protection of foreign commerce, I submit to you whether it may not be\r\nsafely anticipated that if the policy were once settled against\r\nappropriations by the General Government for local improvements for the\r\nbenefit of commerce, localities requiring expenditures would not, by modes\r\nand means clearly legitimate and proper, raise the fund necessary for such\r\nconstructions as the safety or other interests of their commerce might\r\nrequire.\r\n\r\nIf that can be regarded as a system which in the experience of mere than\r\nthirty years has at no time so commanded the public judgment as to give it\r\nthe character of a settled policy; which, though it has produced some works\r\nof conceded importance, has been attended with an expenditure quite\r\ndisproportionate to their value and has resulted in squandering large sums\r\nupon objects which have answered no valuable purpose, the interests of all\r\nthe States require it to be abandoned unless hopes may be indulged for the\r\nfuture which find no warrant in the past.\r\n\r\nWith an anxious desire for the completion of the works which are regarded\r\nby all good citizens with sincere interest, I have deemed it my duty to ask\r\nat your hands a deliberate reconsideration of the question, with a hope\r\nthat, animated by a desire to promote the permanent and substantial\r\ninterests of the country, your wisdom may prove equal to the task of\r\ndevising and maturing a plan which, applied to this subject, may promise\r\nsomething better than constant strife, the suspension of the powers of\r\nlocal enterprise, the exciting of vain hopes, and the disappointment of\r\ncherished expectations.\r\n\r\nIn expending the appropriations made by the last Congress several cases\r\nhave arisen in relation to works for the improvement of harbors which\r\ninvolve questions as to the right of soil and jurisdiction, and have\r\nthreatened conflict between the authority of the State and General\r\nGovernments. The right to construct a breakwater, jetty, or dam would seem\r\nnecessarily to carry with it the power to protect and preserve such\r\nconstructions. This can only be effectually done by having jurisdiction\r\nover the soil. But no clause of the Constitution is found on which to rest\r\nthe claim of the United States to exercise jurisdiction over the soil of a\r\nState except that conferred by the eighth section of the first article of\r\nthe Constitution. It is, then, submitted whether, in all cases where\r\nconstructions are to be erected by the General Government, the right of\r\nsoil should not first be obtained and legislative provision be made to\r\ncover all such cases. For the progress made in the construction of roads\r\nwithin the Territories, as provided for in the appropriations of the last\r\nCongress, I refer you to the report of the Secretary of War.\r\n\r\nThere is one subject of a domestic nature which, from its intrinsic\r\nimportance and the many interesting questions of future policy which it\r\ninvolves, can not fail to receive your early attention. I allude to the\r\nmeans of communication by which different parts of the wide expanse of our\r\ncountry are to be placed in closer connection for purposes both of defense\r\nand commercial intercourse, and more especially such as appertain to the\r\ncommunication of those great divisions of the Union which lie on the\r\nopposite sides of the Rocky Mountains. That the Government has not been\r\nunmindful of this heretofore is apparent from the aid it has afforded\r\nthrough appropriations for mail facilities and other purposes. But the\r\ngeneral subject will now present itself under aspects more imposing and\r\nmore purely national by reason of the surveys ordered by Congress, and now\r\nin the process of completion, for communication by railway across the\r\ncontinent, and wholly within the limits of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe power to declare war, to raise and support armies, to provide and\r\nmaintain a navy, and to call forth the militia to execute the laws,\r\nsuppress insurrections, and repel invasions was conferred upon Congress as\r\nmeans to provide for the common defense and to protect a territory and a\r\npopulation now widespread and vastly multiplied. As incidental to and\r\nindispensable for the exercise of this power, it must sometimes be\r\nnecessary to construct military roads and protect harbors of refuge. To\r\nappropriations by Congress for such objects no sound objection can be\r\nraised. Happily for our country, its peaceful policy and rapidly increasing\r\npopulation impose upon us no urgent necessity for preparation, and leave\r\nbut few trackless deserts between assailable points and a patriotic people\r\never ready and generally able to protect them. These necessary links the\r\nenterprise and energy of our people are steadily and boldly struggling to\r\nsupply. All experience affirms that wherever private enterprise will avail\r\nit is most wise for the General Government to leave to that and individual\r\nwatchfulness the location and execution of all means of communication.\r\n\r\nThe surveys before alluded to were designed to ascertain the most\r\npracticable and economical route for a railroad from the river Mississippi\r\nto the Pacific Ocean. Parties are now in the field making explorations,\r\nwhere previous examinations had not supplied sufficient data and where\r\nthere was the best reason to hope the object sought might be found. The\r\nmeans and time being both limited, it is not to be expected that all the\r\naccurate knowledge desired will be obtained, but it is hoped that much and\r\nimportant information will be added to the stock previously possessed, and\r\nthat partial, if not full, reports of the surveys ordered will be received\r\nin time for transmission to the two Houses of Congress on or before the\r\nfirst Monday in February next, as required by the act of appropriation. The\r\nmagnitude of the enterprise contemplated has aroused and will doubtless\r\ncontinue to excite a very general interest throughout the country. In its\r\npolitical, its commercial, and its military bearings it has varied, great,\r\nand increasing claims to consideration. The heavy expense, the great delay,\r\nand, at times, fatality attending travel by either of the Isthmus routes\r\nhave demonstrated the advantage which would result from interterritorial\r\ncommunication by such safe and rapid means as a railroad would supply.\r\n\r\nThese difficulties, which have been encountered in a period of peace, would\r\nbe magnified and still further increased in time of war. But whilst the\r\nembarrassments already encountered and others under new contingencies to be\r\nanticipated may serve strikingly to exhibit the importance of such a work,\r\nneither these nor all considerations combined can have an appreciable value\r\nwhen weighed against the obligation strictly to adhere to the Constitution\r\nand faithfully to execute the powers it confers.\r\n\r\nWithin this limit and to the extent of the interest of the Government\r\ninvolved it would seem both expedient and proper if an economical and\r\npracticable route shall be found to aid by all constitutional means in the\r\nconstruction of a road which will unite by speedy transit the populations\r\nof the Pacific and Atlantic States. To guard against misconception, it\r\nshould be remarked that although the power to construct or aid in the\r\nconstruction of a road within the limits of a Territory is not embarrassed\r\nby that question of jurisdiction which would arise within the limits of a\r\nState, it is, nevertheless, held to be of doubtful power and more than\r\ndoubtful propriety, even within the limits of a Territory, for the General\r\nGovernment to undertake to administer the affairs of a railroad, a canal,\r\nor other similar construction, and therefore that its connection with a\r\nwork of this character should be incidental rather than primary. I will\r\nonly add at present that, fully appreciating the magnitude of the subject\r\nand solicitous that the Atlantic and Pacific shores of the Republic may be\r\nbound together by inseparable ties of common interest, as well as of common\r\nfealty and attachment to the Union, I shall be disposed, so far as my own\r\naction is concerned, to follow the lights of the Constitution as expounded\r\nand illustrated by those whose opinions and expositions constitute the\r\nstandard of my political faith in regard to the powers of the Federal\r\nGovernment. It is, I trust, not necessary to say that no grandeur of\r\nenterprise and no present urgent inducement promising popular favor will\r\nlead me to disregard those lights or to depart from that path which\r\nexperience has proved to be safe, and which is now radiant with the glow of\r\nprosperity and legitimate constitutional progress. We can afford to wait,\r\nbut we can not afford to overlook the ark of our security.\r\n\r\nIt is no part of my purpose to give prominence to any subject which may\r\nproperly be regarded as set at rest by the deliberate judgment of the\r\npeople. But while the present is bright with promise and the future full of\r\ndemand and inducement for the exercise of active intelligence, the past can\r\nnever be without useful lessons of admonition and instruction. If its\r\ndangers serve not as beacons, they will evidently fail to fulfill the\r\nobject of a wise design. When the grave shall have closed over all who are\r\nnow endeavoring to meet the obligations of duty, the year 1850 will be\r\nrecurred to as a period filled with anxious apprehension. A successful war\r\nhad just terminated. Peace brought with it a vast augmentation of\r\nterritory. Disturbing questions arose bearing upon the domestic\r\ninstitutions of one portion of the Confederacy and involving the\r\nconstitutional rights of the States. But notwithstanding differences of\r\nopinion and sentiment which then existed in relation to details and\r\nspecific provisions, the acquiescence of distinguished citizens, whose\r\ndevotion to the Union can never be doubted, has given renewed vigor to our\r\ninstitutions and restored a sense of repose and security to the public mind\r\nthroughout the Confederacy. That this repose is to suffer no shock during\r\nmy official term, if I have power to avert it, those who placed me here may\r\nbe assured. The wisdom of men who knew what independence cost, who had put\r\nall at stake upon the issue of the Revolutionary struggle, disposed of the\r\nsubject to which I refer in the only way consistent with the Union of these\r\nStates and with the march of power and prosperity which has made us what we\r\nare. It is a significant fact that from the adoption of the Constitution\r\nuntil the officers and soldiers of the Revolution had passed to their\r\ngraves, or, through the infirmities of age and wounds, had ceased to\r\nparticipate actively in public affairs, there was not merely a quiet\r\nacquiescence in, but a prompt vindication of, the constitutional rights of\r\nthe States. The reserved powers were scrupulously respected. No statesman\r\nput forth the narrow views of casuists to justify interference and\r\nagitation, but the spirit of the compact was regarded as sacred in the eye\r\nof honor and indispensable for the great experiment of civil liberty,\r\nwhich, environed by inherent difficulties, was yet borne forward in\r\napparent weakness by a power superior to all obstacles. There is no\r\ncondemnation which the voice of freedom will not pronounce upon us should\r\nwe prove faithless to this great trust. While men inhabiting different\r\nparts of this vast continent can no more be expected to hold the same\r\nopinions or entertain the same sentiments than every variety of climate or\r\nsoil can be expected to furnish the same agricultural products, they can\r\nunite in a common object and sustain common principles essential to the\r\nmaintenance of that object. The gallant men of the South and the North\r\ncould stand together during the struggle of the Revolution; they could\r\nstand together in the more trying period which succeeded the clangor of\r\narms. As their united valor was adequate to all the trials of the camp and\r\ndangers of the field, so their united wisdom proved equal to the greater\r\ntask of founding upon a deep and broad basis institutions which it has been\r\nour privilege to enjoy and will ever be our most sacred duty to sustain. It\r\nis but the feeble expression of a faith strong and universal to say that\r\ntheir sons, whose blood mingled so often upon the same field during the War\r\nof 1812 and who have more recently borne in triumph the flag of the country\r\nupon a foreign soil, will never permit alienation of feeling to weaken the\r\npower of their united efforts nor internal dissensions to paralyze the\r\ngreat arm of freedom, uplifted for the vindication of self-government.\r\n\r\nI have thus briefly presented such suggestions as seem to me especially\r\nworthy of your consideration. In providing for the present you can hardly\r\nfail to avail yourselves of the light which the experience of the past\r\ncasts upon the future.\r\n\r\nThe growth of our population has now brought us, in the destined career of\r\nour national history, to a point at which it well behooves us to expand our\r\nvision over the vast prospective.\r\n\r\nThe successive decennial returns of the census since the adoption of the\r\nConstitution have revealed a law of steady, progressive development, which\r\nmay be stated in general terms as a duplication every quarter century.\r\nCarried forward from the point already reached for only a short period of\r\ntime, as applicable to the existence of a nation, this law of progress, if\r\nunchecked, will bring us to almost incredible results. A large allowance\r\nfor a diminished proportional effect of emigration would not very\r\nmaterially reduce the estimate, while the increased average duration of\r\nhuman life known to have already resulted from the scientific and hygienic\r\nimprovements of the past fifty years will tend to keep up through the next\r\nfifty, or perhaps hundred, the same ratio of growth which has been thus\r\nrevealed in our past progress; and to the influence of these causes may be\r\nadded the influx of laboring masses from eastern Asia to the Pacific side\r\nof our possessions, together with the probable accession of the populations\r\nalready existing in other parts of our hemisphere, which within the period\r\nin question will feel with yearly increasing force the natural attraction\r\nof so vast, powerful, and prosperous a confederation of self-governing\r\nrepublics and will seek the privilege of being admitted within its safe and\r\nhappy bosom, transferring with themselves, by a peaceful and healthy\r\nprocess of incorporation, spacious regions of virgin and exuberant soil,\r\nwhich are destined to swarm with the fast growing and fast-spreading\r\nmillions of our race.\r\n\r\nThese considerations seem fully to justify the presumption that the law of\r\npopulation above stated will continue to act with undiminished effect\r\nthrough at least the next half century, and that thousands of persons who\r\nhave already arrived at maturity and are now exercising the rights of\r\nfreemen will close their eyes on the spectacle of more than 100,000,000 of\r\npopulation embraced within the majestic proportions of the American Union.\r\nIt is not merely as an interesting topic of speculation that I present\r\nthese views for your consideration. They have important practical bearings\r\nupon all the political duties we are called upon to perform. Heretofore our\r\nsystem of government has worked on what may be termed a miniature scale in\r\ncomparison with the development which it must thus assume within a future\r\nso near at hand as scarcely to be beyond the present of the existing\r\ngeneration.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that a confederation so vast and so varied, both in numbers\r\nand in territorial extent, in habits and in interests, could only be kept\r\nin national cohesion by the strictest fidelity to the principles of the\r\nConstitution as understood by those who have adhered to the most restricted\r\nconstruction of the powers granted by the people and the States.\r\nInterpreted and applied according to those principles, the great compact\r\nadapts itself with healthy ease and freedom to an unlimited extension of\r\nthat benign system of federative self-government of which it is our\r\nglorious and, I trust, immortal charter. Let us, then, with redoubled\r\nvigilance, be on our guard against yielding to the temptation of the\r\nexercise of doubtful powers, even under the pressure of the motives of\r\nconceded temporary advantage and apparent temporary expediency. The minimum\r\nof Federal government compatible with the maintenance of national unity and\r\nefficient action in our relations with the rest of the world should afford\r\nthe rule and measure of construction of our powers under the general\r\nclauses of the Constitution. A spirit of strict deference to the sovereign\r\nrights and dignity of every State, rather than a disposition to subordinate\r\nthe States into a provincial relation to the central authority, should\r\ncharacterize all our exercise of the respective powers temporarily vested\r\nin us as a sacred trust from the generous confidence of our constituents.\r\n\r\nIn like manner, as a manifestly indispensable condition of the perpetuation\r\nof the Union and of the realization of that magnificent national future\r\nadverted to, does the duty become yearly stronger and clearer upon us, as\r\ncitizens of the several States, to cultivate a fraternal and affectionate\r\nspirit, language, and conduct in regard to other States and in relation to\r\nthe varied interests, institutions, and habits of sentiment and opinion\r\nwhich may respectively characterize them. Mutual forbearance, respect, and\r\nnoninterference in our personal action as citizens and an enlarged exercise\r\nof the most liberal principles of comity in the public dealings of State\r\nwith State, whether in legislation or in the execution of laws, are the\r\nmeans to perpetuate that confidence and fraternity the decay of which a\r\nmere political union, on so vast a scale, could not long survive.\r\n\r\nIn still another point of view is an important practical duty suggested by\r\nthis consideration of the magnitude of dimensions to which our political\r\nsystem, with its corresponding machinery of government, is so rapidly\r\nexpanding. With increased vigilance does it require us to cultivate the\r\ncardinal virtues of public frugality and official integrity and purity.\r\nPublic affairs ought to be so conducted that a settled conviction shall\r\npervade the entire Union that nothing short of the highest tone and\r\nstandard of public morality marks every part of the administration and\r\nlegislation of the General Government. Thus will the federal system,\r\nwhatever expansion time and progress may give it, continue more and more\r\ndeeply rooted in the love and confidence of the people.\r\n\r\nThat wise economy which is as far removed from parsimony as from corrupt\r\nand corrupting extravagance; that single regard for the public good which\r\nwill frown upon all attempts to approach the Treasury with insidious\r\nprojects of private interest cloaked under public pretexts; that sound\r\nfiscal administration which, in the legislative department, guards against\r\nthe dangerous temptations incident to overflowing revenue, and, in the\r\nexecutive, maintains an unsleeping watchfulness against the tendency of all\r\nnational expenditure to extravagance, while they are admitted elementary\r\npolitical duties, may, I trust, be deemed as properly adverted to and urged\r\nin view of the more impressive sense of that necessity which is directly\r\nsuggested by the considerations now presented.\r\n\r\nSince the adjournment of Congress the Vice-President of the United States\r\nhas passed from the scenes of earth, without having entered upon the duties\r\nof the station to which he had been called by the voice of his countrymen.\r\nHaving occupied almost continuously for more than thirty years a seat in\r\none or the other of the two Houses of Congress, and having by his singular\r\npurity and wisdom secured unbounded confidence and universal respect, his\r\nfailing health was watched by the nation with painful solicitude. His loss\r\nto the country, under all the circumstances, has been justly regarded as\r\nirreparable.\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the act of Congress of March 2, 1853, the oath of office\r\nwas administered to him on the 24th of that month at Ariadne estate, near\r\nMatanzas, in the island of Cuba; but his strength gradually declined, and\r\nwas hardly sufficient to enable him to return to his home in Alabama,\r\nwhere, on the 18th day of April, in the most calm and peaceful way, his\r\nlong and eminently useful career was terminated. Entertaining unlimited\r\nconfidence in your intelligent and patriotic devotion to the public\r\ninterest, and being conscious of no motives on my part which are not\r\ninseparable from the honor and advancement of my country, I hope it may be\r\nmy privilege to deserve and secure not only your cordial cooperation in\r\ngreat public measures, but also those relations of mutual confidence and\r\nregard which it is always so desirable to cultivate between members of\r\ncoordinate branches of the Government.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nFranklin Pierce\r\nDecember 4, 1854\r\n\r\nFellow-Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nThe past has been an eventful year, and will be hereafter referred to as a\r\nmarked epoch in the history of the world. While we have been happily\r\npreserved from the calamities of war, our domestic prosperity has not been\r\nentirely uninterrupted. The crops in portions of the country have been\r\nnearly cut off. Disease has prevailed to a greater extent than usual, and\r\nthe sacrifice of human life through casualties by sea and land is without\r\nparallel. But the pestilence has swept by, and restored salubrity invites\r\nthe absent to their homes and the return of business to its ordinary\r\nchannels. If the earth has rewarded the labor of the husbandman less\r\nbountifully than in preceding seasons, it has left him with abundance for\r\ndomestic wants and a large surplus for exportation. In the present,\r\ntherefore, as in the past, we find ample grounds for reverent thankfulness\r\nto the God of grace and providence for His protecting care and merciful\r\ndealings with us as a people.\r\n\r\nAlthough our attention has been arrested by painful interest in passing\r\nevents, yet our country feels no more than the slight vibrations of the\r\nconvulsions which have shaken Europe. As individuals we can not repress\r\nsympathy with human suffering nor regret for the causes which produce it;\r\nas a nation we are reminded that whatever interrupts the peace or checks\r\nthe prosperity of any part of Christendom tends more or less to involve our\r\nown. The condition of States is not unlike that of individuals; they are\r\nmutually dependent upon each other. Amicable relations between them and\r\nreciprocal good will are essential for the promotion of whatever is\r\ndesirable in their moral, social, and political condition. Hence it has\r\nbeen my earnest endeavor to maintain peace and friendly intercourse with\r\nall nations.\r\n\r\nThe wise theory of this Government, so early adopted and steadily pursued,\r\nof avoiding all entangling alliances has hitherto exempted it from many\r\ncomplications in which it would otherwise have become involved.\r\nNotwithstanding this our clearly defined and well-sustained course of\r\naction and our geographical position, so remote from Europe, increasing\r\ndisposition has been manifested by some of its Governments to supervise and\r\nin certain respects to direct our foreign policy. In plans for adjusting\r\nthe balance of power among themselves they have assumed to take us into\r\naccount, and would constrain us to conform our conduct to their views. One\r\nor another of the powers of Europe has from time to time undertaken to\r\nenforce arbitrary regulations contrary in many respects to established\r\nprinciples of international law. That law the United States have in their\r\nforeign intercourse uniformly respected and observed, and they can not\r\nrecognize any such interpolations therein as the temporary interests of\r\nothers may suggest. They do not admit that the sovereigns of one continent\r\nor of a particular community of states can legislate for all others.\r\n\r\nLeaving the transatlantic nations to adjust their political system in the\r\nway they may think best for their common welfare, the independent powers of\r\nthis continent may well assert the right to be exempt from all annoying\r\ninterference on their part. Systematic abstinence from intimate political\r\nconnection with distant foreign nations does not conflict with giving the\r\nwidest range to our foreign commerce. This distinction, so clearly marked\r\nin history, seems to have been overlooked or disregarded by some leading\r\nforeign states. Our refusal to be brought within and subjected to their\r\npeculiar system has, I fear, created a jealous distrust of our conduct and\r\ninduced on their part occasional acts of disturbing effect upon our foreign\r\nrelations. Our present attitude and past course give assurances, which\r\nshould not be questioned, that our purposes are not aggressive nor\r\nthreatening to the safety and welfare of other nations. Our military\r\nestablishment in time of peace is adapted to maintain exterior defenses and\r\nto preserve order among the aboriginal tribes within the limits of the\r\nUnion. Our naval force is intended only for the protection of our citizens\r\nabroad and of our commerce, diffused, as it is, over all the seas of the\r\nglobe. The Government of the United States, being essentially pacific in\r\npolicy, stands prepared to repel invasion by the voluntary service of a\r\npatriotic people, and provides no permanent means of foreign aggression.\r\nThese considerations should allay all apprehension that we are disposed to\r\nencroach on the rights or endanger the security of other states.\r\n\r\nSome European powers have regarded with disquieting concern the territorial\r\nexpansion of the United States. This rapid growth has resulted from the\r\nlegitimate exercise of sovereign rights belonging alike to all nations, and\r\nby many liberally exercised. Under such circumstances it could hardly have\r\nbeen expected that those among them which have within a comparatively\r\nrecent period subdued and absorbed ancient kingdoms, planted their\r\nstandards on every continent, and now possess or claim the control of the\r\nislands of every ocean as their appropriate domain would look with\r\nunfriendly sentiments upon the acquisitions of this country, in every\r\ninstance honorably obtained, or would feel themselves justified in imputing\r\nour advancement to a spirit of aggression or to a passion for political\r\npredominance. Our foreign commerce has reached a magnitude and extent\r\nnearly equal to that of the first maritime power of the earth, and\r\nexceeding that of any other. Over this great interest, in which not only\r\nour merchants, but all classes of citizens, at least indirectly, are\r\nconcerned, it is the duty of the executive and legislative branches of the\r\nGovernment to exercise a careful supervision and adopt proper measures for\r\nits protection. The policy which I had in view in regard to this interest\r\nembraces its future as well as its present security. Long experience has\r\nshown that, in general, when the principal powers of Europe are engaged in\r\nwar the rights of neutral nations are endangered. This consideration led,\r\nin the progress of the War of our Independence, to the formation of the\r\ncelebrated confederacy of armed neutrality, a primary object of which was\r\nto assert the doctrine that free ships make free goods, except in the case\r\nof articles contraband of war--a doctrine which from the very commencement\r\nof our national being has been a cherished idea of the statesmen of this\r\ncountry. At one period or another every maritime power has by some solemn\r\ntreaty stipulation recognized that principle, and it might have been hoped\r\nthat it would come to be universally received and respected as a rule of\r\ninternational law. But the refusal of one power prevented this, and in the\r\nnext great war which ensued--that of the French Revolution--it failed to be\r\nrespected among the belligerent States of Europe. Notwithstanding this, the\r\nprinciple is generally admitted to be a sound and salutary one, so much so\r\nthat at the commencement of the existing war in Europe Great Britain and\r\nFrance announced their purpose to observe it for the present; not, however,\r\nas a recognized international fight, but as a mere concession for the time\r\nbeing. The cooperation, however, of these two powerful maritime nations in\r\nthe interest of neutral rights appeared to me to afford an occasion\r\ninviting and justifying on the part of the United States a renewed effort\r\nto make the doctrine in question a principle of international law, by means\r\nof special conventions between the several powers of Europe and America.\r\nAccordingly, a proposition embracing not only the rule that free ships make\r\nfree goods, except contraband articles, but also the less contested one\r\nthat neutral property other than contraband, though on board enemy's ships,\r\nshall be exempt from confiscation, has been submitted by this Government to\r\nthose of Europe and America.\r\n\r\nRussia acted promptly in this matter, and a convention was concluded\r\nbetween that country and the United States providing for the observance of\r\nthe principles announced, not only as between themselves, but also as\r\nbetween them and all other nations which shall enter into like\r\nstipulations. None of the other powers have as yet taken final action on\r\nthe subject. I am not aware, however, that any objection to the proposed\r\nstipulations has been made, but, on the contrary, they are acknowledged to\r\nbe essential to the security of neutral commerce, and the only apparent\r\nobstacle to their general adoption is in the possibility that it may be\r\nencumbered by inadmissible conditions. The King of the Two Sicilies has\r\nexpressed to our minister at Naples his readiness to concur in our\r\nproposition relative to neutral rights and to enter into a convention on\r\nthat subject.\r\n\r\nThe King of Prussia entirely approves of the project of a treaty to the\r\nsame effect submitted to him, but proposes an additional article providing\r\nfor the renunciation of privateering. Such an article, for most obvious\r\nreasons, is much desired by nations having naval establishments large in\r\nproportion to their foreign commerce. If it were adopted as an\r\ninternational rule, the commerce of a nation having comparatively a small\r\nnaval force would be very much at the mercy of its enemy in case of war\r\nwith a power of decided naval superiority. The bare statement of the\r\ncondition in which the United States would be placed, after having\r\nsurrendered the right to resort to privateers, in the event of war with a\r\nbelligerent of naval supremacy will show that this Government could never\r\nlisten to such a proposition. The navy of the first maritime power in\r\nEurope is at least ten times as large as that of the United States. The\r\nforeign commerce of the two countries is nearly equal, and about equally\r\nexposed to hostile depredations. In war between that power and the United\r\nStates, without resort on our part to our mercantile marine the means of\r\nour enemy to inflict injury upon our commerce would be tenfold greater than\r\nours to retaliate. We could not extricate our country from this unequal\r\ncondition, with such an enemy, unless we at once departed from our present\r\npeaceful policy and became a great naval power. Nor would this country be\r\nbetter situated in war with one of the secondary naval powers. Though the\r\nnaval disparity would be less, the greater extent and more exposed\r\ncondition of our widespread commerce would give any of them a like\r\nadvantage over us.\r\n\r\nThe proposition to enter into engagements to forego a resort to privateers\r\nin case this country should be forced into war with a great naval power is\r\nnot entitled to more favorable consideration than would be a proposition to\r\nagree not to accept the services of volunteers for operations on land. When\r\nthe honor or the rights of our country require it to assume a hostile\r\nattitude, it confidently relies upon the patriotism of its citizens, not\r\nordinarily devoted to the military profession, to augment the Army and the\r\nNavy so as to make them fully adequate to the emergency which calls them\r\ninto action. The proposal to surrender the right to employ privateers is\r\nprofessedly founded upon the principle that private property of unoffending\r\nnoncombatants, though enemies, should be exempt from the ravages of war;\r\nbut the proposed surrender goes but little way in carrying out that\r\nprinciple, which equally requires that such private property should not be\r\nseized or molested by national ships of war. Should the leading powers of\r\nEurope concur in proposing as a rule of international law to exempt private\r\nproperty upon the ocean from seizure by public armed cruisers as well as by\r\nprivateers, the United States will readily meet them upon that broad\r\nground.\r\n\r\nSince the adjournment of Congress the ratifications of the treaty between\r\nthe United States and Great Britain relative to coast fisheries and to\r\nreciprocal trade with the British North American Provinces have been\r\nexchanged, and some of its anticipated advantages are already enjoyed by\r\nus, although its full execution was to abide certain acts of legislation\r\nnot yet fully performed. So soon as it was ratified Great Britain opened to\r\nour commerce the free navigation of the river St. Lawrence and to our\r\nfishermen unmolested access to the shores and bays, from which they had\r\nbeen previously excluded, on the coasts of her North American Provinces; in\r\nreturn for which she asked for the introduction free of duty into the ports\r\nof the United States of the fish caught on the same coast by British\r\nfishermen. This being the compensation stipulated in the treaty for\r\nprivileges of the highest importance and value to the United States, which\r\nwere thus voluntarily yielded before it became effective, the request\r\nseemed to me to be a reasonable one; but it could not be acceded to from\r\nwant of authority to suspend our laws imposing duties upon all foreign\r\nfish. In the meantime the Treasury Department issued a regulation for\r\nascertaining the duties paid or secured by bonds on fish caught on the\r\ncoasts of the British Provinces and brought to our markets by British\r\nsubjects after the fishing grounds had been made fully accessible to the\r\ncitizens of the United States. I recommend to your favorable consideration\r\na proposition, which will be submitted to you, for authority to refund the\r\nduties and cancel the bonds thus received. The Provinces of Canada and New\r\nBrunswick have also anticipated the full operation of the treaty by\r\nlegislative arrangements, respectively, to admit free of duty the products\r\nof the United States mentioned in the free list of the treaty; and an\r\narrangement similar to that regarding British fish has been made for duties\r\nnow chargeable on the products of those Provinces enumerated in the same\r\nfree list and introduced therefrom into the United States, a proposition\r\nfor refunding which will, in my judgment, be in like manner entitled to\r\nyour favorable consideration.\r\n\r\nThere is difference of opinion between the United States and Great Britain\r\nas to the boundary line of the Territory of Washington adjoining the\r\nBritish possessions on the Pacific, which has already led to difficulties\r\non the part of the citizens and local authorities of the two Governments I\r\nrecommend that provision he made for a commission, to be joined by one on\r\nthe part of Her Britannic Majesty, for the purpose of running and\r\nestablishing the line in controversy. Certain stipulations of the third and\r\nfourth articles of the treaty concluded by the United States and Great\r\nBritain in 1846, regarding possessory rights of the Hudsons Bay Company and\r\nproperty of the Pugets Sound Agricultural Company, have given rise to\r\nserious disputes, and it is important to all concerned that summary means\r\nof settling them amicably should be devised. I have reason to believe that\r\nan arrangement can be made on just terms for the extinguishment of the\r\nrights in question, embracing also the right of the Hudsons Bay Company to\r\nthe navigation of the river Columbia; and I therefore suggest to your\r\nconsideration the expediency of making a contingent appropriation for that\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nFrance was the early and efficient ally of the United States in their\r\nstruggle for independence. From that time to the present, with occasional\r\nslight interruptions, cordial relations of friendship have existed between\r\nthe Governments and people of the two countries. The kindly sentiments\r\ncherished alike by both nations have led to extensive social and commercial\r\nintercourse, which I trust will not be interrupted or checked by any casual\r\nevent of an apparently unsatisfactory character. The French consul at San\r\nFrancisco was not long since brought into the United States district court\r\nat that place by compulsory process as a witness in favor of another\r\nforeign consul, in violation, as the French Government conceives, of his\r\nprivileges under our consular convention with France. There being nothing\r\nin the transaction which could imply any disrespect to France or its\r\nconsul, such explanation has been made as, I hope, will be satisfactory.\r\nSubsequently misunderstanding arose on the subject of the French Government\r\nhaving, as it appeared, abruptly excluded the American minister to Spain\r\nfrom passing through France on his way from London to Madrid. But that\r\nGovernment has unequivocally disavowed any design to deny the right of\r\ntransit to the minister of the United States, and after explanations to\r\nthis effect he has resumed his journey and actually returned through France\r\nto Spain. I herewith lay before Congress the correspondence on this subject\r\nbetween our envoy at Paris and the minister of foreign relations of the\r\nFrench Government.\r\n\r\nThe position of our affairs with Spain remains as at the close of the last\r\nsession. Internal agitation, assuming very nearly the character of\r\npolitical revolution, has recently convulsed that country. The late\r\nministers were violently expelled from power, and men of very different\r\nviews in relation to its internal affairs have succeeded. Since this change\r\nthere has been no propitious opportunity to resume and press on\r\nnegotiations for the adjustment of serious questions of difficulty between\r\nthe Spanish Government and the United States. There is reason to believe\r\nthat our minister will find the present Government more favorably inclined\r\nthan the preceding to comply with our just demands and to make suitable\r\narrangements for restoring harmony and preserving peace between the two\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nNegotiations are pending with Denmark to discontinue the practice of\r\nlevying tolls on our vessels and their cargoes passing through the Sound. I\r\ndo not doubt that we can claim exemption therefrom as a matter of right. It\r\nis admitted on all hands that this exaction is sanctioned, not by the\r\ngeneral principles of the law of nations, but only by special conventions\r\nwhich most of the commercial nations have entered into with Denmark. The\r\nfifth article of our treaty of 1826 with Denmark provides that there shall\r\nnot be paid on the vessels of the United States and their cargoes when\r\npassing through the Sound higher duties than those of the most favored\r\nnations. This may be regarded as an implied agreement to submit to the\r\ntolls during the continuance of the treaty, and consequently may embarrass\r\nthe assertion of our right to be released therefrom. There are also other\r\nprovisions in the treaty which ought to be modified. It was to remain in\r\nforce for ten years and until one year after either party should give\r\nnotice to the other of intention to terminate it. I deem it expedient that\r\nthe contemplated notice should be given to the Government of Denmark.\r\n\r\nThe naval expedition dispatched about two years since for the purpose of\r\nestablishing relations with the Empire of Japan has been ably and\r\nskillfully conducted to a successful termination by the officer to whom it\r\nwas intrusted. A treaty opening certain of the ports of that populous\r\ncountry has been negotiated, and in order to give full effect thereto it\r\nonly remains to exchange ratifications and adopt requisite commercial\r\nregulations.\r\n\r\nThe treaty lately concluded between the United States and Mexico settled\r\nsome of our most embarrassing difficulties with that country, but numerous\r\nclaims upon it for wrongs and injuries to our citizens remained unadjusted,\r\nand many new cases have been recently added to the former list of\r\ngrievances. Our legation has been earnest in its endeavors to obtain from\r\nthe Mexican Government a favorable consideration of these claims, but\r\nhitherto without success. This failure is probably in some measure to be\r\nascribed to the disturbed condition of that country. It has been my anxious\r\ndesire to maintain friendly relations with the Mexican Republic and to\r\ncause its rights and territories to be respected, not only by our citizens,\r\nbut by foreigners who have resorted to the United States for the purpose of\r\norganizing hostile expeditions against some of the States of that Republic.\r\nThe defenseless condition in which its frontiers have been left has\r\nstimulated lawless adventurers to embark in these enterprises and greatly\r\nincreased the difficulty of enforcing our obligations of neutrality.\r\nRegarding it as my solemn duty to fulfill efficiently these obligations not\r\nonly toward Mexico, but other foreign nations, I have exerted all the\r\npowers with which I am invested to defeat such proceedings and bring to\r\npunishment those who by taking a part therein violated our laws. The energy\r\nand activity of our civil and military authorities have frustrated the\r\ndesigns of those who meditated expeditions of this character except in two\r\ninstances. One of these, composed of foreigners, was at first countenanced\r\nand aided by the Mexican Government itself, it having been deceived as to\r\ntheir real object. The other, small in number, eluded the vigilance of the\r\nmagistrates at San Francisco and succeeded in reaching the Mexican\r\nterritories; but the effective measures taken by this Government compelled\r\nthe abandonment of the undertaking.\r\n\r\nThe commission to establish the new line between the United States and\r\nMexico, according to the provisions of the treaty of the 30th of December\r\nlast, has been organized, and the work is already commenced.\r\n\r\nOur treaties with the Argentine Confederation and with the Republics of\r\nUruguay and Paraguay secure to us the free navigation of the river La Plata\r\nand some of its larger tributaries, but the same success has not attended\r\nour endeavors to open the Amazon. The reasons in favor of the free use of\r\nthat river I had occasion to present fully in a former message, and,\r\nconsidering the cordial relations which have long existed between this\r\nGovernment and Brazil, it may be expected that pending negotiations will\r\neventually reach a favorable result.\r\n\r\nConvenient means of transit between the several parts of a country are not\r\nonly desirable for the objects of commercial and personal communication,\r\nbut essential to its existence under one government. Separated, as are the\r\nAtlantic and Pacific coasts of the United States, by the whole breadth of\r\nthe continent, still the inhabitants of each are closely bound together by\r\ncommunity of origin and institutions and by strong attachment to the Union.\r\nHence the constant and increasing intercourse and vast interchange of\r\ncommercial productions between these remote divisions of the Republic. At\r\nthe present time the most practicable and only, commodious routes for\r\ncommunication between them are by the way of the isthmus of Central\r\nAmerica. It is the duty of the Government to secure these avenues against\r\nall danger of interruption.\r\n\r\nIn relation to Central America, perplexing questions existed between the\r\nUnited States and Great Britain at the time of the cession of California.\r\nThese, as well as questions which subsequently arose concerning\r\ninteroceanic communication across the Isthmus, were, as it was supposed,\r\nadjusted by the treaty of April 19, 1850, but, unfortunately, they have\r\nbeen reopened by serious misunderstanding as to the import of some or its\r\nprovisions, a readjustment of which is now under consideration. Our\r\nminister at London has made strenuous efforts to accomplish this desirable\r\nobject, but has not yet found it possible to bring the negotiations to a\r\ntermination.\r\n\r\nAs incidental to these questions, I deem it proper to notice an occurrence\r\nwhich happened in Central America near the close of the last session of\r\nCongress. So soon as the necessity was perceived of establishing\r\ninteroceanic communications across the Isthmus a company was organized,\r\nunder the authority of the State of Nicaragua, but composed for the most\r\npart of citizens of the United States, for the purpose of opening such a\r\ntransit way by the river San Juan and Lake Nicaragua, which soon became an\r\neligible and much used route in the transportation of our citizens and\r\ntheir property between the Atlantic and Pacific. Meanwhile, and in\r\nanticipation of the completion and importance of this transit way, a number\r\nof adventurers had taken possession of the old Spanish port at the mouth of\r\nthe river San Juan in open defiance of the State or States of Central\r\nAmerica, which upon their becoming independent had rightfully succeeded to\r\nthe local sovereignty and jurisdiction of Spain. These adventurers\r\nundertook to change the name of the place from San Juan del Norte to\r\nGreytown, and though at first pretending to act as the subjects of the\r\nfictitious sovereign of the Mosquito Indians, they subsequently repudiated\r\nthe control of any power whatever, assumed to adopt a distinct political\r\norganization, and declared themselves an independent sovereign state. If at\r\nsome time a faint hope was entertained that they might become a stable and\r\nrespectable community, that hope soon vanished. They proceeded to assert\r\nunfounded claims to civil jurisdiction over Punta Arenas, a position on the\r\nopposite side of the river San Juan, which was in possession, under a title\r\nwholly independent of them, of citizens of the United States interested in\r\nthe Nicaragua Transit Company, and which was indispensably necessary to the\r\nprosperous operation of that route across the Isthmus. The company resisted\r\ntheir groundless claims, whereupon they proceeded to destroy some of its\r\nbuildings and attempted violently to dispossess it.\r\n\r\nAt a later period they organized a strong force for the purpose of\r\ndemolishing the establishment at Punta Arenas, but this mischievous design\r\nwas defeated by the interposition of one of our ships of war at that time\r\nin the harbor of San Juan. Subsequently to this, in May last, a body of men\r\nfrom Greytown crossed over to Punta Arenas, arrogating authority to arrest\r\non the charge of murder a captain of one of the steamboats of the Transit\r\nCompany. Being well aware that the claim to exercise jurisdiction there\r\nwould be resisted then, as it had been on previous occasions, they went\r\nprepared to assert it by force of arms. Our minister to Central America\r\nhappened to be present on that occasion. Believing that the captain of the\r\nsteamboat was innocent (for he witnessed the transaction on which the\r\ncharge was founder), and believing also that the intruding party, having no\r\njurisdiction over the place where they proposed to make the arrest, would\r\nencounter desperate resistance if they persisted in their purpose, he\r\ninterposed, effectually, to prevent violence and bloodshed. The American\r\nminister afterwards visited Greytown, and whilst he was there a mob,\r\nincluding certain of the so-called public functionaries of the place,\r\nsurrounded the house in which he was, avowing that they had come to arrest\r\nhim by order of some person exercising the chief authority. While parleying\r\nwith them he was wounded by a missile from the crowd. A boat dispatched\r\nfrom the American steamer Northern Light to release him from the perilous\r\nsituation in which he was understood to be was fired into by the town guard\r\nand compelled to return. These incidents, together with the known character\r\nof the population of Greytown and their excited state, induced just\r\napprehensions that the lives and property of our citizens at Punta Arenas\r\nwould be in imminent danger after the departure of the steamer, with her\r\npassengers, for New York, unless a guard was left for their protection. For\r\nthis purpose, and in order to insure the safety of passengers and property\r\npassing over the route, a temporary force was organized, at considerable\r\nexpense to the United States, for which provision was made at the last\r\nsession of Congress.\r\n\r\nThis pretended community, a heterogeneous assemblage gathered from various\r\ncountries, and composed for the most part of blacks and persons of mixed\r\nblood, had previously given other indications of mischievous and dangerous\r\npropensities. Early in the same month property was clandestinely abstracted\r\nfrom the depot of the Transit Company and taken to Greytown. The plunderers\r\nobtained shelter there and their pursuers were driven back by its people,\r\nwho not only protected the wrongdoers and shared the plunder, but treated\r\nwith rudeness and violence those who sought to recover their property.\r\n\r\nSuch, in substance, are the facts submitted to my consideration, and proved\r\nby trustworthy evidence. I could not doubt that the case demanded the\r\ninterposition of this Government. Justice required that reparation should\r\nbe made for so many and such gross wrongs, and that a course of insolence\r\nand plunder, tending directly to the insecurity of the lives of numerous\r\ntravelers and of the rich treasure belonging to our citizens passing over\r\nthis transit way, should be peremptorily arrested. Whatever it might be in\r\nother respects, the community in question, in power to do mischief, was not\r\ndespicable. It was well provided with ordnance, small arms, and ammunition,\r\nand might easily seize on the unarmed boats, freighted with millions of\r\nproperty, which passed almost daily within its reach. It did not profess to\r\nbelong to any regular government, and had, in fact, no recognized\r\ndependence on or connection with anyone to which the United States or their\r\ninjured citizens might apply for redress or which could be held responsible\r\nin any way for the outrages committed. Not standing before the world in the\r\nattitude of an organized political society, being neither competent to\r\nexercise the rights nor to discharge the obligations of a government, it\r\nwas, in fact, a marauding establishment too dangerous to be disregarded and\r\ntoo guilty to pass unpunished, and yet incapable of being treated in any\r\nother way than as a piratical resort of outlaws or a camp of savages\r\ndepredating on emigrant trains or caravans and the frontier settlements of\r\ncivilized states.\r\n\r\nSeasonable notice was given to the people of Greytown that this Government\r\nrequired them to repair the injuries they had done to our citizens and to\r\nmake suitable apology for their insult of our minister, and that a ship of\r\nwar would be dispatched thither to enforce compliance with these demands.\r\nBut the notice passed unheeded. Thereupon a commander of the Navy, in\r\ncharge of the sloop of war Cyane, was ordered to repeat the demands and to\r\ninsist upon a compliance therewith. Finding that neither the populace nor\r\nthose assuming to have authority over them manifested any disposition to\r\nmake the required reparation, or even to offer excuse for their conduct, he\r\nwarned them by a public proclamation that if they did not give satisfaction\r\nwithin a time specified he would bombard the town. By this procedure he\r\nafforded them opportunity to provide for their personal safety. To those\r\nalso who desired to avoid loss of property in the punishment about to be\r\ninflicted on the offending town he furnished the means of removing their\r\neffects by the boats of his own ship and of a steamer which he procured and\r\ntendered to them for that purpose. At length, perceiving no disposition on\r\nthe part of the town to comply with his requisitions, he appealed to the\r\ncommander of Her Britannic Majesty's schooner Bermuda, who was seen to have\r\nintercourse and apparently much influence with the leaders among them, to\r\ninterpose and persuade them to take some course calculated to save the\r\nnecessity of resorting to the extreme measure indicated in his\r\nproclamation; but that officer, instead of acceding to the request, did\r\nnothing more than to protest against the contemplated bombardment. No steps\r\nof any sort were taken by the people to give the satisfaction required. No\r\nindividuals, if any there were, who regarded themselves as not responsible\r\nfor the misconduct of the community adopted any means to separate\r\nthemselves from the fate of the guilty. The several charges on which the\r\ndemands for redress were founded had been publicly known to all for some\r\ntime, and were again announced to them. They did not deny any of these\r\ncharges; they offered no explanation, nothing in extenuation of their\r\nconduct, but contumaciously refused to hold any intercourse with the\r\ncommander of the Cyane. By their obstinate silence they seemed rather\r\ndesirous to provoke chastisement than to escape it. There is ample reason\r\nto believe that this conduct of wanton defiance on their part is imputable\r\nchiefly to the delusive idea that the American Government would be deterred\r\nfrom punishing them through fear of displeasing a formidable foreign power,\r\nwhich they presumed to think looked with complacency upon their aggressive\r\nand insulting deportment toward the United States. The Cyane at length\r\nfired upon the town. Before much injury had been done the fire was twice\r\nsuspended in order to afford opportunity for an arrangement, but this was\r\ndeclined. Most of the buildings of the place, of little value generally,\r\nwere in the sequel destroyed, but, owing to the considerate precautions\r\ntaken by our naval commander, there was no destruction of life.\r\n\r\nWhen the Cyane was ordered to Central America, it was confidently hoped and\r\nexpected that no occasion would arise for \"a resort to violence and\r\ndestruction of property and loss of life.\" Instructions to that effect were\r\ngiven to her commander; and no extreme act would have been requisite had\r\nnot the people themselves, by their extraordinary conduct in the affair,\r\nfrustrated all the possible mild measures for obtaining satisfaction. A\r\nwithdrawal from the place, the object of his visit entirely defeated, would\r\nunder the circumstances in which the commander of the Cyane found himself\r\nhave been absolute abandonment of all claim of our citizens for\r\nindemnification and submissive acquiescence in national indignity. It would\r\nhave encouraged in these lawless men a spirit of insolence and rapine most\r\ndangerous to the lives and property of our citizens at Punta Arenas, and\r\nprobably emboldened them to grasp at the treasures and valuable merchandise\r\ncontinually passing over the Nicaragua route. It certainly would have been\r\nmost satisfactory to me if the objects of the Cyane's mission could have\r\nbeen consummated without any act of public force, but the arrogant\r\ncontumacy of the offenders rendered it impossible to avoid the alternative\r\neither to break up their establishment or to leave them impressed with the\r\nidea that they might persevere with impunity in a career of insolence and\r\nplunder.\r\n\r\nThis transaction has been the subject of complaint on the part of some\r\nforeign powers, and has been characterized with more of harshness than of\r\njustice. If comparisons were to be instituted, it would not be difficult to\r\npresent repeated instances in the history of states standing in the very\r\nfront of modern civilization where communities far less offending and more\r\ndefenseless than Greytown have been chastised with much greater severity,\r\nand where not cities only have been laid in ruins, but human life has been\r\nrecklessly sacrificed and the blood of the innocent made profusely to\r\nmingle with that of the guilty.\r\n\r\nPassing from foreign to domestic affairs, your attention is naturally\r\ndirected to the financial condition of the country, always a subject of\r\ngeneral interest. For complete and exact information regarding the finances\r\nand the various branches of the public service connected therewith I refer\r\nyou to the report of the Secretary of the Treasury, from which it will\r\nappear that the amount of revenue during the last fiscal year from all\r\nsources was $73,549,705, and that the public expenditures for the same\r\nperiod, exclusive of payments on account of the public debt, amounted to\r\n$51, 018,249. During the same period the payments made in redemption of the\r\npublic debt, including interest and premium, amounted to $24,336,380. To\r\nthe sum total of the receipts of that year is to be added a balance\r\nremaining in the Treasury at the commencement thereof, amounting to\r\n$21,942,892; and at the close of the same year a corresponding balance,\r\namounting to $20,137,967, of receipts above expenditures also remained in\r\nthe Treasury. Although, in the opinion of the Secretary of the Treasury,\r\nthe receipts of the current fiscal year are not likely to equal in amount\r\nthose of the last, yet they will undoubtedly exceed the amount of\r\nexpenditures by at least $15,000,000. I shall therefore continue to direct\r\nthat the surplus revenue be applied, so far as it can be judiciously and\r\neconomically done, to the reduction of the public debt, the amount of which\r\nat the commencement of the last fiscal year was $67,340,628; of which there\r\nhad been paid on the 20th day of November, 1854, the sum of $22,365,172,\r\nleaving a balance of outstanding public debt of only $44,975,456,\r\nredeemable at different periods within fourteen years. There are also\r\nremnants of other Government stocks, most of which are already due, and on\r\nwhich the interest has ceased, but which have not yet been presented for\r\npayment, amounting to $233,179. This statement exhibits the fact that the\r\nannual income of the Government greatly exceeds the amount of its public\r\ndebt, which latter remains unpaid only because the time of payment has not\r\nyet matured, and it can not be discharged at once except at the option of\r\npublic creditors, who prefer to retain the securities of the United States;\r\nand the other fact, not less striking, that the annual revenue from all\r\nsources exceeds by many millions of dollars the amount needed for a prudent\r\nand economical administration of the Government.\r\n\r\nThe estimates presented to Congress from the different Executive\r\nDepartments at the last session amounted to $38,406,581 and the\r\nappropriations made to the sum of $58,116,958. Of this excess of\r\nappropriations over estimates, however, more than twenty millions was\r\napplicable to extraordinary objects, having no reference to the usual\r\nannual expenditures. Among these objects was embraced ten millions to meet\r\nthe third article of the treaty between the United States and Mexico; so\r\nthat, in fact, for objects of ordinary expenditure the appropriations were\r\nlimited to considerably less than $40,000,000. I therefore renew my\r\nrecommendation for a reduction of the duties on imports. The report of the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury presents a series of tables showing the operation\r\nof the revenue system for several successive years; and as the general\r\nprinciple of reduction of duties with a view to revenue, and not\r\nprotection, may now be regarded as the settled policy of the country, I\r\ntrust that little difficulty will be encountered in settling the details of\r\na measure to that effect.\r\n\r\nIn connection with this subject I recommend a change in the laws, which\r\nrecent experience has shown to be essential to the protection of the\r\nGovernment. There is no express provision of law requiring the records and\r\npapers of a public character of the several officers of the Government to\r\nbe left in their offices for the use of their successors, nor any provision\r\ndeclaring it felony on their part to make false entries in the books or\r\nreturn false accounts. In the absence of such express provision by law, the\r\noutgoing officers in many instances have claimed and exercised the right to\r\ntake into their own possession important books and papers, on the ground\r\nthat these were their private property, and have placed them beyond the\r\nreach of the Government. Conduct of this character, brought in several\r\ninstances to the notice of the present Secretary of the Treasury, naturally\r\nawakened his suspicion, and resulted in the disclosure that at four\r\nports--namely, Oswego, Toledo, Sandusky, and Milwaukee--the Treasury had,\r\nby false entries, been defrauded within the four years next preceding\r\nMarch, 1853, of the sum of $198,000. The great difficulty with which the\r\ndetection of these frauds has been attended, in consequence of the\r\nabstraction of books and papers by the retiring officers, and the facility\r\nwith which similar frauds in the public service may be perpetrated render\r\nthe necessity of new legal enactments in the respects above referred to\r\nquite obvious. For other material modifications of the revenue laws which\r\nseem to me desirable, I refer you to the report of the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury. That report and the tables which accompany it furnish ample\r\nproofs of the solid foundation on which the financial security of the\r\ncountry rests and of the salutary influence of the independent-treasury\r\nsystem upon commerce and all monetary operations.\r\n\r\nThe experience of the last year furnishes additional reasons, I regret to\r\nsay, of a painful character, for the recommendation heretofore made to\r\nprovide for increasing the military force employed in the Territory\r\ninhabited by the Indians. The settlers-on the frontier have suffered much\r\nfrom the incursions of predatory bands, and large parties of emigrants to\r\nour Pacific possessions have been massacred with impunity. The recurrence\r\nof such scenes can only be prevented by teaching these wild tribes the\r\npower of and their responsibility to the United States. From the garrisons\r\nof our frontier posts it is only possible to detach troops in small bodies;\r\nand though these have on all occasions displayed a gallantry and a stern\r\ndevotion to duty which on a larger field would have commanded universal\r\nadmiration, they have usually suffered severely in these conflicts with\r\nsuperior numbers, and have sometimes been entirely sacrificed. All the\r\ndisposable force of the Army is already employed on this service, and is\r\nknown to be wholly inadequate to the protection which should be afforded.\r\nThe public mind of the country has been recently shocked by savage\r\natrocities committed upon defenseless emigrants and border settlements, and\r\nhardly less by the unnecessary destruction of valuable lives where\r\ninadequate detachments of troops have undertaken to furnish the needed aid.\r\nWithout increase of the military force these scenes will be repeated, it is\r\nto be feared, on a larger scale and with more disastrous consequences.\r\nCongress, I am sure, will perceive that the plainest duties and\r\nresponsibilities of Government are involved in this question, and I doubt\r\nnot that prompt action may be confidently anticipated when delay must be\r\nattended by such fearful hazards.\r\n\r\nThe bill of the last session providing for an increase of the pay of the\r\nrank and file of the Army has had beneficial results, not only in\r\nfacilitating enlistments, but in obvious improvement in the class of men\r\nwho enter the service. I regret that corresponding consideration was not\r\nbestowed on the officers, who, in view of their character and services and\r\nthe expenses to which they are necessarily subject, receive at present what\r\nis, in my judgment, inadequate compensation.\r\n\r\nThe valuable services constantly rendered by the Army and its inestimable\r\nimportance as the nucleus around which the volunteer forces of the nation\r\ncan promptly gather in the hour of danger, sufficiently attest the wisdom\r\nof maintaining a military peace establishment; but the theory of our system\r\nand the wise practice under it require that any proposed augmentation in\r\ntime of peace be only commensurate with our extended limits and frontier\r\nrelations. While scrupulously adhering to this principle, I find in\r\nexisting circumstances a necessity for increase of our military force, and\r\nit is believed that four new regiments, two of infantry and two of mounted\r\nmen, will be sufficient to meet the present exigency. If it were necessary\r\ncarefully to weigh the cost in a case of such urgency, it would be shown\r\nthat the additional expense would be comparatively light.\r\n\r\nWith the increase of the numerical force of the Army should, I think, be\r\ncombined certain measures of reform in its organic arrangement and\r\nadministration. The present organization is the result of partial\r\nlegislation often directed to special objects and interests; and the laws\r\nregulating rank and command, having been adopted many years ago from the\r\nBritish code, are not always applicable to our service. It is not\r\nsurprising, therefore, that the system should be deficient in the symmetry\r\nand simplicity essential to the harmonious working of its several parts,\r\nand require a careful revision.\r\n\r\nThe present organization, by maintaining large staff corps or departments,\r\nseparates many officers from that close connection with troops and those\r\nactive duties in the field which are deemed requisite to qualify them for\r\nthe varied responsibilities of high command. Were the duties of the Army\r\nstaff mainly discharged by officers detached from their regiments, it is\r\nbelieved that the special service would be equally well performed and the\r\ndiscipline and instruction of the Army be improved. While due regard to the\r\nsecurity of the rights of officers and to the nice sense of honor which\r\nshould be cultivated among them would seem to exact compliance with the\r\nestablished rule of promotion in ordinary cases, still it can hardly be\r\ndoubted that the range of promotion by selection, which is now practically\r\nconfined to the grade of general officers, might be somewhat extended with\r\nbenefit to the public service. Observance of the rule of seniority\r\nsometimes leads, especially in time of peace, to the promotion of officers\r\nwho, after meritorious and even distinguished service, may have been\r\nrendered by age or infirmity incapable of performing active duty, and whose\r\nadvancement, therefore, would tend to impair the efficiency of the Army.\r\nSuitable provision for this class of officers, by the creation of a retired\r\nlist, would remedy the evil without wounding the just pride of men who by\r\npast services have established a claim to high consideration. In again\r\ncommending this measure to the favorable consideration of Congress I would\r\nsuggest that the power of placing officers on the retired list be limited\r\nto one year. The practical operation of the measure would thus be tested,\r\nand if after the lapse of years there should be occasion to renew the\r\nprovision it can be reproduced with any improvements which experience may\r\nindicate. The present organization of the artillery into regiments is\r\nliable to obvious objections. The service of artillery is that of\r\nbatteries, and an organization of batteries into a corps of artillery would\r\nbe more consistent with the nature of their duties. A large part of the\r\ntroops now called artillery are, and have been, on duty as infantry, the\r\ndistinction between the two arms being merely nominal. This nominal\r\nartillery in our service is disproportionate to the whole force and greater\r\nthan the wants of the country demand. I therefore commend the\r\ndiscontinuance of a distinction which has no foundation in either the arms\r\nused or the character of the service expected to be performed.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the proposition for the increase of the Army, I have\r\npresented these suggestions with regard to certain measures of reform as\r\nthe complement of a system which would produce the happiest results from a\r\ngiven expenditure, and which, I hope, may attract the early attention and\r\nbe deemed worthy of the approval of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe recommendation of the Secretary of the Navy having reference to more\r\nample provisions for the discipline and general improvement in the\r\ncharacter of seamen and for the reorganization and gradual increase of the\r\nNavy I deem eminently worthy of your favorable consideration. The\r\nprinciples which have controlled our policy in relation to the permanent\r\nmilitary force by sea and land are sound, consistent with the theory of our\r\nsystem, and should by no means be disregarded. But, limiting the force to\r\nthe objects particularly set forth in the preceding part of this message,\r\nwe should not overlook the present magnitude and prospective extension of\r\nour commercial marine, nor fail to give due weight to the fact that besides\r\nthe 2,000 miles of Atlantic seaboard we have now a Pacific coast stretching\r\nfrom Mexico to the British possessions in the north, teeming with wealth\r\nand enterprise and demanding the constant presence of ships of war. The\r\naugmentation of the Navy has not kept pace with the duties properly and\r\nprofitably assigned to it in time of peace, and it is inadequate for the\r\nlarge field of its operations, not merely in the present, but still more in\r\nthe progressively increasing exigencies of the commerce of the United\r\nStates. I cordially approve of the proposed apprentice system for our\r\nnational vessels recommended by the Secretary of the Navy. The occurrence\r\nduring the last few months of marine disasters of the most tragic nature,\r\ninvolving great loss of human life, has produced intense emotions of\r\nsympathy and sorrow throughout the country. It may well be doubted whether\r\nall these calamitous events are wholly attributable to the necessary and\r\ninevitable dangers of the sea. The merchants, mariners, and shipbuilders of\r\nthe United States are, it is true, unsurpassed in far-reaching enterprise,\r\nskill, intelligence, and courage by any others in the world. But with the\r\nincreasing amount of our commercial tonnage in the aggregate and the larger\r\nsize and improved equipment of the ships now constructed a deficiency in\r\nthe supply of reliable seamen begins to be very seriously felt. The\r\ninconvenience may perhaps be met in part by due regulation for the\r\nintroduction into our merchant ships of indented apprentices, which, while\r\nit would afford useful and eligible occupation to numerous young men, would\r\nhave a tendency to raise the character of seamen as a class. And it is\r\ndeserving of serious reflection whether it may not be desirable to revise\r\nthe existing laws for the maintenance of discipline at sea, upon which the\r\nsecurity of life and property on the ocean must to so great an extent\r\ndepend. Although much attention has already been given by Congress to the\r\nproper construction and arrangement of steam vessels and all passenger\r\nships, still it is believed that the resources of science and mechanical\r\nskill in this direction have not been exhausted. No good reason exists for\r\nthe marked distinction which appears upon our statutes between the laws for\r\nprotecting life and property at sea and those for protecting them on land.\r\nIn most of the States severe penalties are provided to punish conductors of\r\ntrains, engineers, and others employed in the transportation of persons by\r\nrailway or by steamboats on rivers. Why should not the same principle be\r\napplied to acts of insubordination, cowardice, or other misconduct on the\r\npart of masters and mariners producing injury or death to passengers on the\r\nhigh seas, beyond the jurisdiction of any of the States, and where such\r\ndelinquencies can be reached only by the power of Congress? The whole\r\nsubject is earnestly commended to your consideration.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Postmaster-General, to which you are referred for many\r\ninteresting details in relation to this important and rapidly extending\r\nbranch of the public service, shows that the expenditure of the year ending\r\nJune 30, 1854, including $133,483 of balance due to foreign offices,\r\namounted to $8,710,907. The gross receipts during the same period amounted\r\nto $6,955,586, exhibiting an expenditure over income of $1,755,321 and a\r\ndiminution of deficiency as compared with the last year of $361,756. The\r\nincrease of the revenue of the Department for the year ending June 30,\r\n1854, over the preceding year was $970,399. No proportionate increase,\r\nhowever, can be anticipated for the current year, in consequence of the act\r\nof Congress of June 23, 1854, providing for increased compensation to all\r\npostmasters. From these statements it is apparent that the Post-Office\r\nDepartment, instead of defraying its expenses according to the design at\r\nthe time of its creation, is now, and under existing laws must continue to\r\nbe, to no small extent a charge upon the general Treasury. The cost of mail\r\ntransportation during the year ending June 30, 1854, exceeds the cost of\r\nthe preceding year by $495,074. I again call your attention to the subject\r\nof mail transportation by ocean steamers, and commend the suggestions of\r\nthe Postmaster General to your early attention.\r\n\r\nDuring the last fiscal year 11,070,935 acres of the public lands have been\r\nsurveyed and 8,190,017 acres brought into market. The number of acres sold\r\nis 7,035,735 and the amount received therefor $9,285,533. The aggregate\r\namount of lands sold, located under military scrip and land warrants,\r\nselected as swamp lands by States, and by locating under grants for roads\r\nis upward of 23,000,000 acres. The increase of lands sold over the previous\r\nyear is about 6,000,000 acres, and the sales during the first two quarters\r\nof the current year present the extraordinary result of five and a half\r\nmillions sold, exceeding by nearly 4,000,000 acres the sales of the\r\ncorresponding quarters of the last year.\r\n\r\nThe commendable policy of the Government in relation to setting apart\r\npublic domain for those who have served their country in time of war is\r\nillustrated by the fact that since 1790 no less than 30,000,000 acres have\r\nbeen applied to this object.\r\n\r\nThe suggestions which I submitted in my annual message of last year in\r\nreference to grants of land in aid of the construction of railways were\r\nless full and explicit than the magnitude of the subject and subsequent\r\ndevelopments would seem to render proper and desirable. Of the soundness of\r\nthe principle then asserted with regard to the limitation of the power of\r\nCongress I entertain no doubt, but in its application it is not enough that\r\nthe value of lands in a particular locality may be enhanced; that, in fact,\r\na larger amount of money may probably be received in a given time for\r\nalternate sections than could have been realized for all the sections\r\nwithout the impulse and influence of the proposed improvements. A prudent\r\nproprietor looks beyond limited sections of his domain, beyond present\r\nresults to the ultimate effect which a particular line of policy is likely\r\nto produce upon all his possessions and interests. The Government, which is\r\ntrustee in this matter for the people of the States, is bound to take the\r\nsame wise and comprehensive view. Prior to and during the last session of\r\nCongress upward of 30,000,000 acres of land were withdrawn from public sale\r\nwith a view to applications for grants of this character pending before\r\nCongress. A careful review of the whole subject led me to direct that all\r\nsuch orders be abrogated and the lands restored to market, and instructions\r\nwere immediately given to that effect. The applications at the last session\r\ncontemplated the construction of more than 5,000 miles of road and grants\r\nto the amount of nearly 20,000,000 acres of the public domain. Even\r\nadmitting the right on the part of Congress to be unquestionable, is it\r\nquite clear that the proposed grants would be productive of good, and not\r\nevil? The different projects are confined for the present to eleven States\r\nof this Union and one Territory. The reasons assigned for the grants show\r\nthat it is proposed to put the works speedily in process of construction.\r\nWhen we reflect that since the commencement of the construction of railways\r\nin the United States, stimulated, as they have been, by the large dividends\r\nrealized from the earlier works over the great thoroughfares and between\r\nthe most important points of commerce and population, encouraged by State\r\nlegislation, and pressed forward by the amazing energy of private\r\nenterprise, only 17,000 miles have been completed in all the States in a\r\nquarter of a century; when we see the crippled condition of many works\r\ncommenced and prosecuted upon what were deemed to be sound principles and\r\nsafe calculations; when we contemplate the enormous absorption of capital\r\nwithdrawn from the ordinary channels of business, the extravagant rates of\r\ninterest at this moment paid to continue operations, the bankruptcies, not\r\nmerely in money but in character, and the inevitable effect upon finances\r\ngenerally, can it be doubted that the tendency is to run to excess in this\r\nmatter? Is it wise to augment this excess by encouraging hopes of sudden\r\nwealth expected to flow from magnificent schemes dependent upon the action\r\nof Congress? Does the spirit which has produced such results need to be\r\nstimulated or checked? Is it not the better rule to leave all these works\r\nto private enterprise, regulated and, when expedient, aided by the\r\ncooperation of States? If constructed by private capital the stimulant and\r\nthe check go together and furnish a salutary restraint against speculative\r\nschemes and extravagance. But it is manifest that with the most effective\r\nguards there is danger of going too fast and too far. We may well pause\r\nbefore a proposition contemplating a simultaneous movement for the\r\nconstruction of railroads which in extent will equal, exclusive of the\r\ngreat Pacific road and all its branches, nearly one-third of the entire\r\nlength of such works now completed in the United States, and which can not\r\ncost with equipments less than $150,000,000. The dangers likely to result\r\nfrom combinations of interests of this character can hardly be\r\noverestimated. But independently of these considerations, where is the\r\naccurate knowledge, the comprehensive intelligence, which shall\r\ndiscriminate between the relative claims of these twenty eight proposed\r\nroads in eleven States and one Territory? Where will you begin and where\r\nend? If to enable these companies to execute their proposed works it is\r\nnecessary that the aid of the General Government be primarily given, the\r\npolicy will present a problem so comprehensive in its bearings and so\r\nimportant to our political and social well-being as to claim in\r\nanticipation the severest analysis. Entertaining these views, I recur with\r\nsatisfaction to the experience and action of the last session of Congress\r\nas furnishing assurance that the subject will not fail to elicit a careful\r\nreexamination and rigid scrutiny. It was my intention to present on this\r\noccasion some suggestions regarding internal improvements by the General\r\nGovernment, which want of time at the close of the last session prevented\r\nmy submitting on the return to the House of Representatives with objections\r\nof the bill entitled \"An act making appropriations for the repair,\r\npreservation, and completion of certain public works heretofore commenced\r\nunder the authority of law;\" but the space in this communication already\r\noccupied with other matter of immediate public exigency constrains me to\r\nreserve that subject for a special message, which will be transmitted to\r\nthe two Houses of Congress at an early day. The judicial establishment of\r\nthe United States requires modification, and certain reforms in the manner\r\nof conducting the legal business of the Government are also much needed;\r\nbut as I have addressed you upon both of these subjects at length before, I\r\nhave only to call your attention to the suggestions then made.\r\n\r\nMy former recommendations in relation to suitable provision for various\r\nobjects of deep interest to the inhabitants of the District of Columbia are\r\nrenewed. Many of these objects partake largely of a national character, and\r\nare important independently of their relation to the prosperity of the only\r\nconsiderable organized community in the Union entirely unrepresented in\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nI have thus presented suggestions on such subjects as appear to me to be of\r\nparticular interest or importance, and therefore most worthy of\r\nconsideration during the short remaining period allotted to the labors of\r\nthe present Congress.\r\n\r\nOur forefathers of the thirteen united colonies, in acquiring their\r\nindependence and in rounding this Republic of the United States of America,\r\nhave devolved upon us, their descendants, the greatest and the most noble\r\ntrust ever committed to the hands of man, imposing upon all, and especially\r\nsuch as the public will may have invested for the time being with political\r\nfunctions, the most sacred obligations. We have to maintain inviolate the\r\ngreat doctrine of the inherent right of popular self-government; to\r\nreconcile the largest liberty of the individual citizen with complete\r\nsecurity of the public order; to render cheerful obedience to the laws of\r\nthe land, to unite in enforcing their execution, and to frown indignantly\r\non all combinations to resist them; to harmonize a sincere and ardent\r\ndevotion to the institutions of religions faith with the most universal\r\nreligious toleration; to preserve the rights of all by causing each to\r\nrespect those of the other; to carry forward every social improvement to\r\nthe uttermost limit of human perfectibility, by the free action of mind\r\nupon mind, not by the obtrusive intervention of misapplied force; to uphold\r\nthe integrity and guard the limitations of our organic law; to preserve\r\nsacred from all touch of usurpation, as the very palladium of our political\r\nsalvation, the reserved rights and powers of the several States and of the\r\npeople; to cherish with loyal fealty and devoted affection this Union, as\r\nthe only sure foundation on which the hopes of civil liberty rest; to\r\nadminister government with vigilant integrity and rigid economy; to\r\ncultivate peace and friendship with foreign nations, and to demand and\r\nexact equal justice from all, but to do wrong to none; to eschew\r\nintermeddling with the national policy and the domestic repose of other\r\ngovernments, and to repel it from our own; never to shrink from war when\r\nthe rights and the honor of the country call us to arms, but to cultivate\r\nin preference the arts of peace, seek enlargement of the rights of\r\nneutrality, and elevate and liberalize the intercourse of nations; and by\r\nsuch just and honorable means, and such only, whilst exalting the condition\r\nof the Republic, to assure to it the legitimate influence and the benign\r\nauthority of a great example amongst all the powers of Christendom.\r\n\r\nUnder the solemnity of these convictions the blessing of Almighty God is\r\nearnestly invoked to attend upon your deliberations and upon all the\r\ncounsels and acts of the Government, to the end that, with common zeal and\r\ncommon efforts, we may, in humble submission to the divine will, cooperate\r\nfor the promotion of the supreme good of these United States.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nFranklin Pierce\r\nDecember 31, 1855\r\n\r\nFellow-Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of the United States provides that Congress shall assemble\r\nannually on the first Monday of December, and it has been usual for the\r\nPresident to make no communication of a public character to the Senate and\r\nHouse of Representatives until advised of their readiness to receive it. I\r\nhave deferred to this usage until the close of the first month of the\r\nsession, but my convictions of duty will not permit me longer to postpone\r\nthe discharge of the obligation enjoined by the Constitution upon the\r\nPresident \"to give to the Congress information of the state of the Union\r\nand recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge\r\nnecessary and expedient.\" It is matter of congratulation that the Republic\r\nis tranquilly advancing in a career of prosperity and peace.\r\n\r\nWhilst relations of amity continue to exist between the United States and\r\nall foreign powers, with some of them grave questions are depending which\r\nmay require the consideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nOf such questions, the most important is that which has arisen out of the\r\nnegotiations with Great Britain in reference to Central America. By the\r\nconvention concluded between the two Governments on the 19th of April,\r\n1850, both parties covenanted that \"neither will ever\" \"occupy, or fortify,\r\nor colonize, or assume or exercise any dominion over Nicaragua. Costa Rica,\r\nthe Mosquito Coast, or any part of Central America.\"\r\n\r\nIt was the undoubted understanding of the United States in making this\r\ntreaty that all the present States of the former Republic of Central\r\nAmerica and the entire territory of each would thenceforth enjoy complete\r\nindependence, and that both contracting parties engaged equally and to the\r\nsame extent, for the present and, for the future, that if either then had\r\nany claim of right in Central America such claim and all occupation or\r\nauthority under it were unreservedly relinquished by the stipulations of\r\nthe convention, and that no dominion was thereafter to be exercised or\r\nassumed in any part of Central America by Great Britain or the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nThis Government consented to restrictions in regard to a region of country\r\nwherein we had specific and peculiar interests only upon the conviction\r\nthat the like restrictions were in the same sense obligatory on Great\r\nBritain. But for this understanding of the force and effect of the\r\nconvention it would never have been concluded by us.\r\n\r\nSo clear was this understanding on the part of the United States that in\r\ncorrespondence contemporaneous with the ratification of the convention it\r\nwas distinctly expressed that the mutual covenants of nonoccupation were\r\nnot intended to apply to the British establishment at the Balize. This\r\nqualification is to be ascribed to the fact that, in virtue of successive\r\ntreaties with previous sovereigns of the country, Great Britain had\r\nobtained a concession of the right to cut mahogany or dyewoods at the\r\nBalize, but with positive exclusion of all domain or sovereignty; and thus\r\nit confirms the natural construction and understood import of the treaty as\r\nto all the rest of the region to which the stipulations applied.\r\n\r\nIt, however, became apparent at an early day after entering upon the\r\ndischarge of my present functions that Great Britain still continued in the\r\nexercise or assertion of large authority in all that part of Central\r\nAmerica commonly called the Mosquito Coast, and covering the entire length\r\nof the State of Nicaragua and a part of Costa Rica; that she regarded the\r\nBalize as her absolute domain and was gradually extending its limits at the\r\nexpense of the State of Honduras, and, that she had formally colonized a\r\nconsiderable insular group known as the Bay Islands, and belonging of right\r\nto that State.\r\n\r\nAll these acts or pretensions of Great Britain, being contrary to the\r\nrights of the States of Central America and to the manifest tenor of her\r\nstipulations with the United States as understood by this Government, have\r\nbeen made the subject of negotiation through the American minister in\r\nLondon. I transmit herewith the instructions to him on the subject and the\r\ncorrespondence between him and the British secretary for foreign affairs,\r\nby which you will perceive that the two Governments differ widely and\r\nirreconcilably as to the construction of the convention and its effect on\r\ntheir respective relations to Central America.\r\n\r\nGreat Britain so construes the convention as to maintain unchanged all her\r\nprevious pretensions over the Mosquito Coast and in different parts of\r\nCentral America. These pretensions as to the Mosquito Coast are founded on\r\nthe assumption of political relation between Great Britain and the remnant\r\nof a tribe of Indians on that coast, entered into at a time when the whole\r\ncountry was a colonial possession of Spain. It can not be successfully\r\ncontroverted that by the public law of Europe and America no possible act\r\nof such Indians or their predecessors could confer on Great Britain any\r\npolitical rights.\r\n\r\nGreat Britain does not allege the assent of Spain as the origin of her\r\nclaims on the Mosquito Coast. She has, on the contrary, by repeated and\r\nsuccessive treaties renounced and relinquished all pretensions of her own\r\nand recognized the full and sovereign rights of Spain in the most\r\nunequivocal terms. Yet these pretensions, so without solid foundation in\r\nthe beginning and thus repeatedly abjured, were at a recent period revived\r\nby Great Britain against the Central American States, the legitimate\r\nsuccessors to all the ancient jurisdiction of Spain in that region. They\r\nwere first applied only to a defined part of the coast of Nicaragua,\r\nafterwards to the whole of its Atlantic coast, and lastly to a part of the\r\ncoast of Costa Rica, and they are now reasserted to this extent\r\nnotwithstanding engagements to the United States.\r\n\r\nOn the eastern coast of Nicaragua and Costa Rica the interference of Great\r\nBritain, though exerted at one time in the form of military occupation of\r\nthe port of San Juan del Norte, then in the peaceful possession of the\r\nappropriate authorities of the Central American States, is now presented by\r\nher as the rightful exercise of a protectorship over the Mosquito tribe of\r\nIndians.\r\n\r\nBut the establishment at the Balize, now reaching far beyond its treaty\r\nlimits into the State of Honduras, and that of the Bay Islands,\r\nappertaining of right to the same State, are as distinctly colonial\r\ngovernments as those of Jamaica or Canada, and therefore contrary to the\r\nvery letter, as well as the spirit, of the convention with the United\r\nStates as it was at the time of ratification and now is understood by this\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nThe interpretation which the British Government thus, in assertion and act,\r\npersists in ascribing to the convention entirely changes its character.\r\nWhile it holds us to all our obligations, it in a great measure releases\r\nGreat Britain from those which constituted the consideration of this\r\nGovernment for entering into the convention. It is impossible, in my\r\njudgment, for the United States to acquiesce in such a construction of the\r\nrespective relations of the two Governments to Central America.\r\n\r\nTo a renewed call by this Government upon Great Britain to abide by and\r\nCarry into effect the stipulations of the convention according to its\r\nobvious import by withdrawing from the possession or colonization of\r\nportions of the Central American States of Honduras, Nicaragua, and Costa\r\nRica, the British Government has at length replied, affirming that the\r\noperation of the treaty is prospective only and did not require Great\r\nBritain to abandon or contract any possessions held by her in Central\r\nAmerica at the date of its conclusion.\r\n\r\nThis reply substitutes a partial issue in the place of the general one\r\npresented by the United States. The British Government passes over the\r\nquestion of the rights of Great Britain, real or supposed, in Central\r\nAmerica, and assumes that she had such rights at the date of the treaty and\r\nthat those rights comprehended the protectorship of the Mosquito Indians,\r\nthe extended jurisdiction and limits of the Balize, and the colony of the\r\nBay Islands, and thereupon proceeds by implication to infer that if the\r\nstipulations of the treaty be merely future in effect Great Britain may\r\nstill continue to hold the contested portions of Central America. The\r\nUnited States can not admit either the inference or the premises. We\r\nsteadily deny that at the date of the treaty Great Britain had any\r\npossessions there other than the limited and peculiar establishment at the\r\nBalize, and maintain that if she had any they were surrendered by the\r\nconvention.\r\n\r\nThis Government, recognizing the obligations of the treaty, has, of course,\r\ndesired to see it executed in good faith by both parties, and in the\r\ndiscussion, therefore, has not looked to rights which we might assert\r\nindependently of the treaty in consideration of our geographical position\r\nand of other circumstances which create for us relations to the Central\r\nAmerican States different from those of any government of Europe. The\r\nBritish Government, in its last communication, although well knowing the\r\nviews of the United States, still declares that it sees no reason why a\r\nconciliatory spirit may not enable the two Governments to overcome all\r\nobstacles to a satisfactory adjustment of the subject.\r\n\r\nAssured of the correctness of the construction of the treaty constantly\r\nadhered to by this Government and resolved to insist on the rights of the\r\nUnited States, yet actuated also by the same desire which is avowed by the\r\nBritish Government, to remove all causes of serious misunderstanding\r\nbetween two nations associated by so many ties of interest and kindred, it\r\nhas appeared to me proper not to consider an amicable solution of the\r\ncontroversy hopeless.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, reason to apprehend that with Great Britain in the\r\nactual occupation of the disputed territories, and the treaty therefore\r\npractically null so far as regards our rights, this international\r\ndifficulty can not long remain undetermined without involving in serious\r\ndanger the friendly relations which it is the interest as well as the duty\r\nof both countries to cherish and preserve. It will afford me sincere\r\ngratification if future efforts shall result in the success anticipated\r\nheretofore with more confidence than the aspect of the case permits me now\r\nto entertain.\r\n\r\nOne other subject of discussion between the United States and Great Britain\r\nhas grown out of the attempt, which the exigencies of the war in which she\r\nis engaged with Russia induced her to make, to draw recruits from the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nIt is the traditional and settled policy of the United States to maintain\r\nimpartial neutrality during the wars which from time to time occur among\r\nthe great powers of the world. Performing all the duties of neutrality\r\ntoward the respective belligerent states, we may reasonably expect them not\r\nto interfere with our lawful enjoyment of its benefits. Notwithstanding the\r\nexistence of such hostilities, our citizens retained the individual right\r\nto continue all their accustomed pursuits, by land or by sea, at home or\r\nabroad, subject only to such restrictions in this relation as the laws of\r\nwar, the usage of nations, or special treaties may impose; and it is our\r\nsovereign right that our territory and jurisdiction shall not be invaded by\r\neither of the belligerent parties for the transit of their armies, the\r\noperations of their fleets, the levy of troops for their service, the\r\nfitting out of cruisers by or against either, or any other act or incident\r\nof war. And these undeniable rights of neutrality, individual and national,\r\nthe United States will under no circumstances surrender.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of this policy, the laws of the United States do not forbid\r\ntheir citizens to sell to either of the belligerent powers articles\r\ncontraband of war or take munitions of war or soldiers on board their\r\nprivate ships for transportation; and although in so doing the individual\r\ncitizen exposes his property or person to some of the hazards of war, his\r\nacts do not involve any breach of national neutrality nor of themselves\r\nimplicate the Government. Thus, during the progress of the present war in\r\nEurope, our citizens have, without national responsibility therefor, sold\r\ngunpowder and arms to all buyers, regardless of the destination of those\r\narticles. Our merchantmen have been, and still continue to be, largely\r\nemployed by Great Britain and by France in transporting troops, provisions,\r\nand munitions of war to the principal seat of military operations and in\r\nbringing home their sick and wounded soldiers; but such use of our\r\nmercantile marine is not interdicted either by the international or by our\r\nmunicipal law, and therefore does not compromise our neutral relations with\r\nRussia. But our municipal law, in accordance with the law of nations,\r\nperemptorily forbids not only foreigners, but our own citizens, to fit out\r\nwithin the United States a vessel to commit hostilities against any state\r\nwith which the United States are at peace, or to increase the force of any\r\nforeign armed vessel intended for such hostilities against a friendly\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nWhatever concern may have been felt by either of the belligerent powers\r\nlest private armed cruisers or other vessels in the service of one might be\r\nfitted out in the ports of this country to depredate on the property of the\r\nother, all such fears have proved to be utterly groundless. Our citizens\r\nhave been withheld from any such act or purpose by good faith and by\r\nrespect for the law.\r\n\r\nWhile the laws of the Union are thus peremptory in their prohibition of the\r\nequipment or armament of belligerent cruisers in our ports, they provide\r\nnot less absolutely that no person shall, within the territory or\r\njurisdiction of the United States, enlist or enter himself, or hire or\r\nretain another person to enlist or enter himself, or to go beyond the\r\nlimits or jurisdiction of the United States with intent to be enlisted or\r\nentered, in the service of any foreign state, either as a soldier or as a\r\nmarine or seaman on board of any vessel of war, letter of marque, or\r\nprivateer. And these enactments are also in strict conformity with the law\r\nof nations, which declares that no state has the right to raise troops for\r\nland or sea service in another state without its consent, and that, whether\r\nforbidden by the municipal law or not, the very attempt to do it without\r\nsuch consent is an attack on the national sovereignty.\r\n\r\nSuch being the public rights and the municipal law of the United States, no\r\nsolicitude on the subject was entertained by this Government when, a year\r\nsince, the British Parliament passed an act to provide for the enlistment\r\nof foreigners in the military service of Great Britain. Nothing on the face\r\nof the act or in its public history indicated that the British Government\r\nproposed to attempt recruitment in the United States, nor did it ever give\r\nintimation of such intention to this Government. It was matter of surprise,\r\ntherefore, to find subsequently that the engagement of persons within the\r\nUnited States to proceed to Halifax, in the British Province of Nova\r\nScotia, and there enlist in the service of Great Britain, was going on\r\nextensively, with little or no disguise. Ordinary legal steps were\r\nimmediately taken to arrest and punish parties concerned, and so put an end\r\nto acts infringing the municipal law and derogatory to our sovereignty.\r\nMeanwhile suitable representations on the subject were addressed to the\r\nBritish Government.\r\n\r\nThereupon it became known, by the admission of the British Government\r\nitself, that the attempt to draw recruits from this country originated with\r\nit, or at least had its approval and sanction; but it also appeared that\r\nthe public agents engaged in it had \"stringent instructions\" not to violate\r\nthe municipal law of the United States.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to understand how it should have been supposed that troops\r\ncould be raised here by Great Britain without violation of the municipal\r\nlaw. The unmistakable object of the law was to prevent every such act which\r\nif performed must be either in violation of the law or in studied evasion\r\nof it, and in either alternative the act done would be alike injurious to\r\nthe sovereignty of the United States. In the meantime the matter acquired\r\nadditional importance by the recruitments in the United States not being\r\ndiscontinued, and the disclosure of the fact that they were prosecuted upon\r\na systematic plan devised by official authority; that recruiting rendezvous\r\nhad been opened in our principal cities and depots for the reception of\r\nrecruits established on our frontier, and the whole business conducted\r\nunder the supervision and by the regular cooperation of British officers,\r\ncivil and military, some in the North American Provinces and some in the\r\nUnited States. The complicity of those officers in an undertaking which\r\ncould only be accomplished by defying our laws, throwing suspicion over our\r\nattitude of neutrality, and disregarding our territorial rights is\r\nconclusively proved by the evidence elicited on the trial of such of their\r\nagents as have been apprehended and convicted. Some of the officers thus\r\nimplicated are of high official position, and many of them beyond our\r\njurisdiction, so that legal proceedings could not reach the source of the\r\nmischief.\r\n\r\nThese considerations, and the fact that the cause of complaint was not a\r\nmere casual occurrence, trot a deliberate design, entered upon with full\r\nknowledge of our laws and national policy and conducted by responsible\r\npublic functionaries, impelled me to present the case to the British\r\nGovernment, in order to secure not only a cessation of the, wrong, but its\r\nreparation. The subject is still under discussion, the result of which will\r\nbe communicated to you in due time.\r\n\r\nI repeat the recommendation submitted to the last Congress, that provision\r\nbe made for the appointment of a commissioner, in connection with Great\r\nBritain, to survey and establish the boundary line which divides the\r\nTerritory of Washington from the contiguous British possessions. By reason\r\nof the extent and importance of the country in dispute, there has been\r\nimminent danger of collision between the subjects of Great Britain and the\r\ncitizens of the United States, including their respective authorities, in\r\nthat quarter. The prospect of a speedy arrangement has contributed hitherto\r\nto induce on both sides forbearance to assert by force what each claims as\r\na right. Continuance of delay on the part of the two Governments to act in\r\nthe matter will increase the dangers and difficulties of the controversy.\r\n\r\nMisunderstanding exists as to the extent, character, and value of the\r\npossessory rights of the Hudsons Bay Company and the property of the Pugets\r\nSound Agricultural Company reserved in our treaty with Great Britain\r\nrelative to the Territory of Oregon. I have reason to believe that a\r\ncession of the rights of both companies to the United States, which would\r\nbe the readiest means of terminating all questions, can be obtained on\r\nreasonable terms, and with a view to this end I present the subject to the\r\nattention of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe colony of Newfoundland, having enacted the laws required by the treaty\r\nof the 5th of June, 1854, is now placed on the same footing in respect to\r\ncommercial intercourse with the United States as the other British North\r\nAmerican Provinces.\r\n\r\nThe commission which that treaty contemplated, for determining the rights\r\nof fishery in rivers and mouths of rivers on the coasts of the United\r\nStates and the British North American Provinces, has been organized, and\r\nhas commenced its labors, to complete which there are needed further\r\nappropriations for the service of another season.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the authority conferred by a resolution of the Senate of\r\nthe United States passed on the 3d of March last, notice was given to\r\nDenmark on the 14th day of April of the intention of this Government to\r\navail itself of the stipulation of the subsisting convention of friendship,\r\ncommerce, and navigation between that Kingdom and the United States whereby\r\neither party might after ten years terminate the same at the expiration of\r\none year from the date of notice for that purpose.\r\n\r\nThe considerations which led me to call the attention of Congress to that\r\nconvention and induced the Senate to adopt the resolution referred to still\r\ncontinue in full force. The convention contains an article which, although\r\nit does not directly engage the United States to submit to the imposition\r\nof tolls on the vessels and cargoes of Americans passing into or from the\r\nBaltic Sea during the continuance of the treaty, yet may by possibility be\r\nconstrued as implying such submission. The exaction of those tolls not\r\nbeing justified by any principle of international law, it became the right\r\nand duty of the United States to relieve themselves from the implication of\r\nengagement on the subject, so as to be perfectly free to act in the\r\npremises in such way as their public interests and honor shall demand.\r\n\r\nI remain of the opinion that the United States ought not to submit to the\r\npayment of the Sound dues, not so much because of their amount, which is a\r\nsecondary matter, but because it is in effect the recognition of the right\r\nof Denmark to treat one of the great maritime highways of nations as a\r\nclose sea, and prevent the navigation of it as a privilege, for which\r\ntribute may be imposed upon those who have occasion to use it.\r\n\r\nThis Government on a former occasion, not unlike the present, signalized\r\nits determination to maintain the freedom of the seas and of the great\r\nnatural channels of navigation. The Barbary States had for a long time\r\ncoerced the payment of tribute from all nations whose ships frequented the\r\nMediterranean. To the last demand of such payment made by them the United\r\nStates, although suffering less by their depredations than many other\r\nnations, returned the explicit answer that we preferred war to tribute, and\r\nthus opened the way to the relief of the commerce of the world from an\r\nignominious tax, so long submitted to by the more powerful nations of\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nIf the manner of payment of the Sound dues differ from that of the tribute\r\nformerly conceded to the Barbary States, still their exaction by Denmark\r\nhas no better foundation in right. Each was in its origin nothing but a tax\r\non a common natural right, extorted by those who were at that time able to\r\nobstruct the free and secure enjoyment of it, but who no longer possess\r\nthat power.\r\n\r\nDenmark, while resisting our assertion of the freedom of the Baltic Sound\r\nand Belts, has indicated a readiness to make some new arrangement on the\r\nsubject, and has invited the governments interested, including the United\r\nStates, to be represented in a convention to assemble for the purpose of\r\nreceiving and considering a proposition which she intends to submit for the\r\ncapitalization of the Sound dues and the distribution of the sum to be paid\r\nas commutation among the governments according to the respective\r\nproportions of their maritime commerce to and from the Baltic. I have\r\ndeclined, in behalf of the United States, to accept this invitation, for\r\nthe most cogent reasons. One is that Denmark does not offer to submit to\r\nthe convention the question of her right to levy the Sound dues. The second\r\nis that if the convention were allowed to take cognizance of that\r\nparticular question, still it would not be competent to deal with the great\r\ninternational principle involved, which affects the right in other cases of\r\nnavigation and commercial freedom, as well as that of access to the Baltic.\r\nAbove all, by the express terms of the proposition it is contemplated that\r\nthe consideration of the Sound dues shall be commingled with and made\r\nsubordinate to a matter wholly extraneous--the balance of power among the\r\nGovernments of Europe.\r\n\r\nWhile, however, rejecting this proposition and insisting on the right of\r\nfree transit into and from the Baltic, I have expressed to Denmark a\r\nwillingness on the part of the United States to share liberally with other\r\npowers in compensating her for any advantages which commerce shall\r\nhereafter derive from expenditures made by her for the improvement and\r\nsafety of the navigation of the Sound or Belts.\r\n\r\nI lay before you herewith sundry documents on the subject, in which my\r\nviews are more fully disclosed. Should no satisfactory arrangement be soon\r\nconcluded, I shall again call your attention to the subject, with\r\nrecommendation of such measures as may appear to be required in order to\r\nassert and secure the rights of the United States, so far as they are\r\naffected by the pretensions of Denmark.\r\n\r\nI announce with much gratification that since the adjournment of the last\r\nCongress the question then existing between this Government and that of\r\nFrance respecting the French consul at San Francisco has been\r\nsatisfactorily determined, and that the relations of the two Governments\r\ncontinue to be of the most friendly nature.\r\n\r\nA question, also, which has been pending for several years between the\r\nUnited States and the Kingdom of Greece, growing out of the sequestration\r\nby public authorities of that country of property belonging to the present\r\nAmerican consul at Athens, and which had been the subject of very earnest\r\ndiscussion heretofore, has recently been settled to the satisfaction of the\r\nparty interested and of both Governments.\r\n\r\nWith Spain peaceful relations are still maintained, and some progress has\r\nbeen made in securing the redress of wrongs complained of by this\r\nGovernment. Spain has not only disavowed and disapproved the conduct of the\r\nofficers who illegally seized and detained the steamer Black Warrior at\r\nHavana, but has also paid the sum claimed as indemnity for the loss thereby\r\ninflicted on citizens of the United States.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of a destructive hurricane which visited Cuba in 1844, the\r\nsupreme authority of that island issued a decree permitting the importation\r\nfor the period of six months of certain building materials and provisions\r\nfree of duty, but revoked it when about half the period only had elapsed,\r\nto the injury of citizens of the United States who had proceeded to act on\r\nthe faith of that decree. The Spanish Government refused indemnification to\r\nthe parties aggrieved until recently, when it was assented to, payment\r\nbeing promised to be made so soon as the amount due can be ascertained.\r\n\r\nSatisfaction claimed for the arrest and search of the steamer El Dorado has\r\nnot yet been accorded, but there is reason to believe that it will be; and\r\nthat case, with others, continues to be urged on the attention of the\r\nSpanish Government. I do not abandon the hope of concluding with Spain some\r\ngeneral arrangement which, if it do not wholly prevent the recurrence of\r\ndifficulties in Cuba, will render them less frequent, and, whenever they\r\nshall occur, facilitate their more speedy settlement.\r\n\r\nThe interposition of this Government has been invoked by many of its\r\ncitizens on account of injuries done to their persons and property for\r\nwhich the Mexican Republic is responsible. The unhappy situation of that\r\ncountry for some time past has not allowed its Government to give due\r\nconsideration to claims of private reparation, and has appeared to call for\r\nand justify some forbearance in such matters on the part of this\r\nGovernment. But if the revolutionary movements which have lately occurred\r\nin that Republic end in the organization of a stable government, urgent\r\nappeals to its justice will then be made, and, it may be hoped, with\r\nsuccess, for the redress of all complaints of our citizens.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the American Republics, which from their proximity and other\r\nconsiderations have peculiar relations to this Government, while it has\r\nbeen my constant aim strictly to observe all the obligations of political\r\nfriendship and of good neighborhood, obstacles to this have arisen in some\r\nof them from their own insufficient power to cheek lawless irruptions,\r\nwhich in effect throws most of the task on the United States. Thus it is\r\nthat the distracted internal condition of the State of Nicaragua has made\r\nit incumbent on me to appeal to the good faith of our citizens to abstain\r\nfrom unlawful intervention in its affairs and to adopt preventive measures\r\nto the same end, which on a similar occasion had the best results in\r\nreassuring the peace of the Mexican States of Sonora and Lower California.\r\n\r\nSince the last session of Congress a treaty of amity, commerce, and\r\nnavigation and for the surrender of fugitive criminals with the Kingdom of\r\nthe Two Sicilies; a treaty of friendship, commerce, and navigation with\r\nNicaragua, and a convention of commercial reciprocity with the Hawaiian\r\nKingdom have been negotiated. The latter Kingdom and the State of Nicaragua\r\nhave also acceded to a declaration recognizing as international rights the\r\nprinciples contained in the convention between the United States and Russia\r\nof July 22, 1854. These treaties and conventions will be laid before the\r\nSenate for ratification.\r\n\r\nThe statements made in my last annual message respecting the anticipated\r\nreceipts and expenditures of the Treasury have been substantially\r\nverified.\r\n\r\nIt appears from the report of the Secretary of the Treasury that the\r\nreceipts during the last fiscal year, ending June 30, 1855, from all\r\nsources were $65,003,930, and that the public expenditures for the same\r\nperiod, exclusive of payments on account of the public debt, amounted to\r\n$56,365,393. During the same period the payments made in redemption of the\r\npublic debt, including interest and premium, amounted to $9,844,528.\r\n\r\nThe balance in the Treasury at the beginning of the present fiscal year,\r\nJuly 1, 1855, was $18,931,976; the receipts for the first quarter and the\r\nestimated receipts for the remaining three quarters amount together to\r\n$67,918,734; thus affording in all, as the available resources of the\r\ncurrent fiscal year, the sum of $86,856,710.\r\n\r\nIf to the actual expenditures of the first quarter of the current fiscal\r\nyear be added the probable expenditures for the remaining three quarters,\r\nas estimated by the Secretary of the Treasury, the sum total will be\r\n$71,226,846, thereby leaving an estimated balance in the Treasury on July\r\n1, 1856, of $15,623,863.41.\r\n\r\nIn the above-estimated expenditures of the present fiscal year are included\r\n$3,000,000 to meet the last installment of the ten millions provided for in\r\nthe late treaty with Mexico and $7,750,000 appropriated on account of the\r\ndebt due to Texas, which two sums make an aggregate amount of $10,750,000\r\nand reduce the expenditures, actual or estimated, for ordinary objects of\r\nthe year to the sum of $60,476,000.\r\n\r\nThe amount of the public debt at the commencement of the present fiscal\r\nyear was $40,583,631, and, deduction being made of subsequent payments, the\r\nwhole public debt of the Federal Government remaining at this time is less\r\nthan $40,000,000. The remnant of certain other Government stocks, amounting\r\nto $243,000, referred to in my last message as outstanding, has since been\r\npaid.\r\n\r\nI am fully persuaded that it would be difficult to devise a system superior\r\nto that by which the fiscal business of the Government is now conducted.\r\nNotwithstanding the great number of public agents of collection and\r\ndisbursement, it is believed that the checks and guards provided, including\r\nthe requirement of monthly returns, render it scarcely possible for any\r\nconsiderable fraud on the part of those agents or neglect involving hazard\r\nof serious public loss to escape detection. I renew, however, the\r\nrecommendation heretofore made by me of the enactment of a law declaring it\r\nfelony on the part of public officers to insert false entries in their\r\nbooks of record or account or to make false returns, and also requiring\r\nthem on the termination of their service to deliver to their successors all\r\nbooks, records, and other objects of a public nature in their custody.\r\n\r\nDerived, as our public revenue is, in chief part from duties on imports,\r\nits magnitude affords gratifying evidence of the prosperity, not only of\r\nour commerce, but of the other great interests upon which that depends.\r\n\r\nThe principle that all moneys not required for the current expenses of the\r\nGovernment should remain for active employment in the hands of the people\r\nand the conspicuous fact that the annual revenue from all sources exceeds\r\nby many millions of dollars the amount needed for a prudent and economical\r\nadministration of public affairs can not fail to suggest the propriety of\r\nan early revision and reduction of the tariff of duties on imports. It is\r\nnow so generally conceded that the purpose of revenue alone can justify the\r\nimposition of duties on imports that in readjusting the impost tables and\r\nschedules, which unquestionably require essential modifications, a\r\ndeparture from the principles of the present tariff is not anticipated.\r\n\r\nThe Army during the past year has been actively engaged in defending the\r\nIndian frontier, the state of the service permitting but few and small\r\ngarrisons in our permanent fortifications. The additional regiments\r\nauthorized at the last session of Congress have been recruited and\r\norganized, and a large portion of the troops have already been sent to the\r\nfield. All the duties which devolve on the military establishment have been\r\nsatisfactorily performed, and the dangers and privations incident to the\r\ncharacter of the service required of our troops have furnished additional\r\nevidence of their courage, zeal, and capacity to meet any requisition which\r\ntheir country may make upon them. For the details of the military\r\noperations, the distribution of the troops, and additional provisions\r\nrequired for the military service, I refer to the report of the Secretary\r\nof War and the accompanying documents.\r\n\r\nExperience gathered from events which have transpired since my last annual\r\nmessage has but served to confirm the opinion then expressed of the\r\npropriety of making provision by a retired list for disabled officers and\r\nfor increased compensation to the officers retained on the list for active\r\nduty. All the reasons which existed when these measures were recommended on\r\nformer occasions continue without modification, except so far as\r\ncircumstances have given to some of them additional force.\r\n\r\nThe recommendations heretofore made for a partial reorganization of the\r\nArmy are also renewed. The thorough elementary education given to those\r\nofficers who commenced their service with the grade of cadet qualifies them\r\nto a considerable extent to perform the duties of every arm of the service;\r\nbut to give the highest efficiency to artillery requires the practice and\r\nspecial study of many years, and it is not, therefore, believed to be\r\nadvisable to maintain in time of peace a larger force of that arm than can\r\nbe usually employed in the duties appertaining to the service of field and\r\nsiege artillery. The duties of the staff in all its various branches belong\r\nto the movements of troops, and the efficiency of an army in the field\r\nwould materially depend upon the ability with which those duties are\r\ndischarged. It is not, as in the case of the artillery, a specialty, but\r\nrequires also an intimate knowledge of the duties of an officer of the\r\nline, and it is not doubted that to complete the education of an officer\r\nfor either the line or the general staff it is desirable that he shall have\r\nserved in both. With this view, it was recommended on a former occasion\r\nthat the duties of the staff should be mainly performed by details from the\r\nline, and, with conviction of the advantages which would result from such a\r\nchange, it is again presented for the consideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Navy, herewith submitted, exhibits in\r\nfull the naval operations of the past year, together with the present\r\ncondition of the service, and it makes suggestions of further legislation,\r\nto which your attention is invited.\r\n\r\nThe construction of the six steam frigates for which appropriations were\r\nmade by the last Congress has proceeded in the most satisfactory manner and\r\nwith such expedition as to warrant the belief that they will be ready for\r\nservice early in the coming spring. Important as this addition to our naval\r\nforce is, it still remains inadequate to the contingent exigencies of the\r\nprotection of the extensive seacoast and vast commercial interests of the\r\nUnited States. In view of this fact and of the acknowledged wisdom of the\r\npolicy of a gradual and systematic increase of the Navy an appropriation is\r\nrecommended for the construction of six steam sloops of war.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the steps taken in execution of the act of Congress to promote\r\nthe efficiency of the Navy, it is unnecessary for me to say more than to\r\nexpress entire concurrence in the observations on that subject presented by\r\nthe Secretary in his report.\r\n\r\nIt will be perceived by the report of the postmaster-General that the gross\r\nexpenditure of the Department for the last fiscal year was $9,968,342 and\r\nthe gross receipts $7,342,136, making an excess of expenditure over\r\nreceipts of $2,626,206; and that the cost of mail transportation during\r\nthat year was $674,952 greater than the previous year. Much of the heavy\r\nexpenditures to which the Treasury is thus subjected is to be ascribed to\r\nthe large quantity of printed matter conveyed by the mails, either franked\r\nor liable to no postage by law or to very low rates of postage compared\r\nwith that charged on letters, and to the great cost of mail service on\r\nrailroads and by ocean steamers. The suggestions of the Postmaster-General\r\non the subject deserve the consideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Interior will engage your attention as\r\nwell for useful suggestions it contains as for the interest and importance\r\nof the subjects to which they refer.\r\n\r\nThe aggregate amount of public land sold during the last fiscal year,\r\nlocated with military scrip or land warrants, taken up under grants for\r\nroads, and selected as swamp lands by States is 24,557,409 acres, of which\r\nthe portion sold was 15,729,524 acres, yielding in receipts the sum of\r\n$11,485,380. In the same period of time 8,723,854 acres have been surveyed,\r\nbut, in consideration of the quantity already subject to entry, no\r\nadditional tracts have been brought into market.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar relation of the General Government to the District of Columbia\r\nrenders it proper to commend to your care not only its material but also\r\nits moral interests, including education, more especially in those parts of\r\nthe District outside of the cities of Washington and Georgetown.\r\n\r\nThe commissioners appointed to revise and codify the laws of the District\r\nhave made such progress in the performance of their task as to insure its\r\ncompletion in the time prescribed by the act of Congress.\r\n\r\nInformation has recently been received that the peace of the settlements in\r\nthe Territories of Oregon and Washington is disturbed by hostilities on the\r\npart of the Indians, with indications of extensive combinations of a\r\nhostile character among the tribes in that quarter, the more serious in\r\ntheir possible effect by reason of the undetermined foreign interests\r\nexisting in those Territories, to which your attention has already been\r\nespecially invited. Efficient measures have been taken, which, it is\r\nbelieved, will restore quiet and afford protection to our citizens.\r\n\r\nIn the Territory of Kansas there have been acts prejudicial to good order,\r\nbut as yet none have occurred under circumstances to justify the\r\ninterposition of the Federal Executive. That could only be in case of\r\nobstruction to Federal law or of organized resistance to Territorial law,\r\nassuming the character of insurrection, which, if it should occur, it would\r\nbe my duty promptly to overcome and suppress. I cherish the hope, however,\r\nthat the occurrence of any such untoward event will be prevented by the\r\nsound sense of the people of the Territory, who by its organic law,\r\npossessing the right to determine their own domestic institutions, are\r\nentitled while deporting themselves peacefully to the free exercise of that\r\nright, and must be protected in the enjoyment of it without interference on\r\nthe part of the citizens of any of the States. The southern boundary line\r\nof this Territory has never been surveyed and established. The rapidly\r\nextending settlements in that region and the fact that the main route\r\nbetween Independence, in the State of Missouri, and New Mexico is\r\ncontiguous in this line suggest the probability that embarrassing questions\r\nof jurisdiction may consequently arise. For these and other considerations\r\nI commend the subject to your early attention.\r\n\r\nI have thus passed in review the general state of the Union, including such\r\nparticular concerns of the Federal Government, whether of domestic or\r\nforeign relation, as it appeared to me desirable and useful to bring to the\r\nspecial notice of Congress. Unlike the great States of Europe and Asia and\r\nmany of those of America, these United States are wasting their strength\r\nneither in foreign war nor domestic strife. Whatever of discontent or\r\npublic dissatisfaction exists is attributable to the imperfections of human\r\nnature or is incident to all governments, however perfect, which human\r\nwisdom can devise. Such subjects of political agitation as occupy the\r\npublic mind consist to a great extent of exaggeration of inevitable evils,\r\nor over zeal in social improvement, or mere imagination of grievance,\r\nhaving but remote connection with any of the constitutional functions or\r\nduties of the Federal Government. To whatever extent these questions\r\nexhibit a tendency menacing to the stability of the Constitution or the\r\nintegrity of the Union, and no further, they demand the consideration of\r\nthe Executive and require to be presented by him to Congress.\r\n\r\nBefore the thirteen colonies became a confederation of independent States\r\nthey were associated only by community of transatlantic origin, by\r\ngeographical position, and by the mutual tie of common dependence on Great\r\nBritain. When that tie was sundered they severally assumed the powers and\r\nrights of absolute self-government. The municipal and social institutions\r\nof each, its laws of property and of personal relation, even its political\r\norganization, were such only as each one chose to establish, wholly without\r\ninterference from any other. In the language of the Declaration of\r\nIndependence, each State had \"full power to levy war, conclude peace,\r\ncontract alliances, establish commerce, and to do all other acts and things\r\nwhich independent states may of right do.\" The several colonies differed in\r\nclimate, in soil, in natural productions, in religion, in systems of\r\neducation, in legislation, and in the forms of political administration,\r\nand they continued to differ in these respects when they voluntarily allied\r\nthemselves as States to carry on the War of the Revolution. The object of\r\nthat war was to disenthrall the united colonies from foreign rule, which\r\nhad proved to be oppressive, and to separate them permanently from the\r\nmother country. The political result was the foundation of a Federal\r\nRepublic of the free white men of the colonies, constituted, as they were,\r\nin distinct and reciprocally independent State governments. As for the\r\nsubject races, whether Indian or African, the wise and brave statesmen of\r\nthat day, being engaged in no extravagant scheme of social change, left\r\nthem as they were, and thus preserved themselves and their posterity from\r\nthe anarchy and the ever-recurring civil wars which have prevailed in other\r\nrevolutionized European colonies of America.\r\n\r\nWhen the confederated States found it convenient to modify the conditions\r\nof their association by giving to the General Government direct access in\r\nsome respects to the people of the States, instead of confining it to\r\naction on the States as such, they proceeded to frame the existing\r\nConstitution, adhering steadily to one guiding thought, which was to\r\ndelegate only such power as was necessary and proper to the execution of\r\nspecific purposes, or, in other words, to retain as much as possible\r\nconsistently with those purposes of the independent powers of the\r\nindividual States. For objects of common defense and security, they\r\nintrusted to the General Government certain carefully defined functions,\r\nleaving all others as the undelegated rights of the separate independent\r\nsovereignties.\r\n\r\nSuch is the constitutional theory of our Government, the practical\r\nobservance of which has carried us, and us alone among modern republics,\r\nthrough nearly three generations of time without the cost of one drop of\r\nblood shed in civil war. With freedom and concert of action, it has enabled\r\nus to contend successfully on the battlefield against foreign foes, has\r\nelevated the feeble colonies into powerful States, and has raised our\r\nindustrial productions and our commerce which transports them to the level\r\nof the richest and the greatest nations of Europe. And the admirable\r\nadaptation of our political institutions to their objects, combining local\r\nself-government with aggregate strength, has established the practicability\r\nof a government like ours to cover a continent with confederate states.\r\n\r\nThe Congress of the United States is in effect that congress of\r\nsovereignties which good men in the Old World have sought for, but could\r\nnever attain, and which imparts to America an exemption from the mutable\r\nleagues for common action, from the wars, the mutual invasions, and vague\r\naspirations after the balance of power which convulse from time to time the\r\nGovernments of Europe. Our cooperative action rests in the conditions of\r\npermanent confederation prescribed by the Constitution. Our balance of\r\npower is in the separate reserved rights of the States and their equal\r\nrepresentation in the Senate. That independent sovereignty in every one of\r\nthe States, with its reserved rights of local self-government assured to\r\neach by their coequal power in the Senate, was the fundamental condition of\r\nthe Constitution. Without it the Union would never have existed. However\r\ndesirous the larger States might be to reorganize the Government so as to\r\ngive to their population its proportionate weight in the common counsels,\r\nthey knew it was impossible unless they conceded to the smaller ones\r\nauthority to exercise at least a negative influence on all the measures of\r\nthe Government, whether legislative or executive, through their equal\r\nrepresentation in the Senate. Indeed, the larger States themselves could\r\nnot have failed to perceive that the same power was equally necessary to\r\nthem for the security of their own domestic interests against the aggregate\r\nforce of the General Government. In a word, the original States went into\r\nthis permanent league on the agreed premises of exerting their common\r\nstrength for the defense of the whole and of all its parts, but of utterly\r\nexcluding all capability of reciprocal aggression. Each solemnly bound\r\nitself to all the others neither to undertake nor permit any encroachment\r\nupon or intermeddling with another's reserved rights.\r\n\r\nWhere it was deemed expedient particular rights of the States were\r\nexpressly guaranteed by the Constitution, but in all things besides these\r\nrights were guarded by the limitation of the powers granted and by express\r\nreservation of all powers not granted in the compact of union. Thus the\r\ngreat power of taxation was limited to purposes of common defense and\r\ngeneral welfare, excluding objects appertaining to the local legislation of\r\nthe several States; and those purposes of general welfare and common\r\ndefense were afterwards defined by specific enumeration as being matters\r\nonly of co-relation between the States themselves or between them and\r\nforeign governments, which, because of their common and general nature,\r\ncould not be left to the separate control of each State.\r\n\r\nOf the circumstances of local condition, interest, and rights in which a\r\nportion of the States, constituting one great section of the Union,\r\ndiffered from the rest and from another section, the most important was the\r\npeculiarity of a larger relative colored population in the Southern than in\r\nthe Northern States.\r\n\r\nA population of this class, held in subjection, existed in nearly all the\r\nStates, but was more numerous and of more serious concernment in the South\r\nthan in the North on account of natural differences of climate and\r\nproduction; and it was foreseen that, for the same reasons, while this\r\npopulation would diminish and sooner or later cease to exist in some\r\nStates, it might increase in others. The peculiar character and magnitude\r\nof this question of local rights, not in material relations only, but still\r\nmore in social ones, caused it to enter into the special stipulations of\r\nthe Constitution.\r\n\r\nHence, while the General Government, as well by the enumerated powers\r\ngranted to it as by those not enumerated, and therefore refused to it, was\r\nforbidden to touch this matter in the sense of attack or offense, it was\r\nplaced under the general safeguard of the Union in the sense of defense\r\nagainst either invasion or domestic violence, like all other local\r\ninterests of the several States. Each State expressly stipulated, as well\r\nfor itself as for each and all of its citizens, and every citizen of each\r\nState became solemnly bound by his allegiance to the Constitution that any\r\nperson held to service or labor in one State, escaping into another, should\r\nnot, in consequence of any law or regulation thereof, be discharged from\r\nsuch service or labor, but should be delivered up on claim of the party to\r\nwhom such service or labor might be due by the laws of his State.\r\n\r\nThus and thus only, by the reciprocal guaranty of all the rights of every\r\nState against interference on the part of another, was the present form of\r\ngovernment established by our fathers and transmitted to us, and by no\r\nother means is it possible for it to exist. If one State ceases to respect\r\nthe rights of another and obtrusively intermeddles with its local\r\ninterests; if a portion of the States assume to impose their institutions\r\non the others or refuse to fulfill their obligations to them, we are no\r\nlonger united, friendly States, but distracted, hostile ones, with little\r\ncapacity left of common advantage, but abundant means of reciprocal injury\r\nand mischief. Practically it is immaterial whether aggressive interference\r\nbetween the States or deliberate refusal on the part of any one of them to\r\ncomply with constitutional obligations arise from erroneous conviction or\r\nblind prejudice, whether it be perpetrated by direction or indirection. In\r\neither case it is full of threat and of danger to the durability of the\r\nUnion.\r\n\r\nPlaced in the office of Chief Magistrate as the executive agent of the\r\nwhole country, bound to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, and\r\nspecially enjoined by the Constitution to give information to Congress on\r\nthe state of the Union, it would be palpable neglect of duty on my part to\r\npass over a subject like this, which beyond all things at the present time\r\nvitally concerns individual and public security.\r\n\r\nIt has been matter of painful regret to see States conspicuous for their\r\nservices in rounding this Republic and equally sharing its advantages\r\ndisregard their constitutional obligations to it. Although conscious of\r\ntheir inability to heal admitted and palpable social evils of their own,\r\nand which are completely within their jurisdiction, they engage in the\r\noffensive and hopeless undertaking of reforming the domestic institutions\r\nof other States, wholly beyond their control and authority. In the vain\r\npursuit of ends by them entirely unattainable, and which they may not\r\nlegally attempt to compass, they peril the very existence of the\r\nConstitution and all the countless benefits which it has conferred. While\r\nthe people of the Southern States confine their attention to their own\r\naffairs, not presuming officiously to intermeddle with the social\r\ninstitutions of the Northern States, too many of the inhabitants of the\r\nlatter are permanently organized in associations to inflict injury on the\r\nformer by wrongful acts, which would be cause of war as between foreign\r\npowers and only fail to be such in our system because perpetrated under\r\ncover of the Union.\r\n\r\nIs it possible to present this subject as truth and the occasion require\r\nwithout noticing the reiterated but groundless allegation that the South\r\nhas persistently asserted claims and obtained advantages in the practical\r\nadministration of the General Government to the prejudice of the North, and\r\nin which the latter has acquiesced? That is, the States which either\r\npromote or tolerate attacks on the rights of persons and of property in\r\nother States, to disguise their own injustice, pretend or imagine, and\r\nconstantly aver, that they, whose constitutional rights are thus\r\nsystematically assailed, are themselves the aggressors. At the present time\r\nthis imputed aggression, resting, as it does, only in the vague declamatory\r\ncharges of political agitators, resolves itself into misapprehension, or\r\nmisinterpretation, of the principles and facts of the political\r\norganization of the new Territories of the United States.\r\n\r\nWhat is the voice of history? When the ordinance which provided for the\r\ngovernment of the territory northwest of the river Ohio and for its\r\neventual subdivision into new States was adopted in the Congress of the\r\nConfederation, it is not to be supposed that the question of future\r\nrelative power as between the States which retained and those which did not\r\nretain a numerous colored population escaped notice or failed to be\r\nconsidered. And yet the concession of that vast territory to the interests\r\nand opinions of the Northern States, a territory now the seat of five among\r\nthe largest members of the Union, was in great measure the act of the State\r\nof Virginia and of the South.\r\n\r\nWhen Louisiana was acquired by the United States, it was an acquisition not\r\nless to the North than to the South; for while it was important to the\r\ncountry at the mouth of the river Mississippi to become the emporium of the\r\ncountry above it, so also it was even more important to the whole Union to\r\nhave that emporium; and although the new province, by reason of its\r\nimperfect settlement, was mainly regarded as on the Gulf of Mexico, yet in\r\nfact it extended to the opposite boundaries of the United States, with far\r\ngreater breadth above than below, and was in territory, as in everything\r\nelse, equally at least an accession to the Northern States. It is mere\r\ndelusion and prejudice, therefore, to speak of Louisiana as acquisition in\r\nthe special interest of the South.\r\n\r\nThe patriotic and just men who participated in the act were influenced by\r\nmotives far above all sectional jealousies. It was in truth the great event\r\nwhich, by completing for us the possession of the Valley of the\r\nMississippi, with commercial access to the Gulf of Mexico, imparted unity\r\nand strength to the whole Confederation and attached together by\r\nindissoluble ties the East and the West, as well as the North and the\r\nSouth.\r\n\r\nAs to Florida, that was but the transfer by Spain to the United States of\r\nterritory on the east side of the river Mississippi in exchange for large\r\nterritory which the United States transferred to Spain on the west side of\r\nthat river, as the entire diplomatic history of the transaction serves to\r\ndemonstrate. Moreover, it was an acquisition demanded by the commercial\r\ninterests and the security of the whole Union. In the meantime the people\r\nof the United States had grown up to a proper consciousness of their\r\nstrength, and in a brief contest with France and in a second serious war\r\nwith Great Britain they had shaken off all which remained of undue\r\nreverence for Europe, and emerged from the atmosphere of those\r\ntransatlantic influences which surrounded the infant Republic, and had\r\nbegun to turn their attention to the full and systematic development of the\r\ninternal resources of the Union.\r\n\r\nAmong the evanescent controversies of that period the most conspicuous was\r\nthe question of regulation by Congress of the social condition of the\r\nfuture States to be rounded in the territory of Louisiana.\r\n\r\nThe ordinance for the government of the territory northwest of the river\r\nOhio had contained a provision which prohibited the use of servile labor\r\ntherein, subject to the condition of the extraditions of fugitives from\r\nservice due in any other part of the United States. Subsequently to the\r\nadoption of the Constitution this provision ceased to remain as a law, for\r\nits operation as such was absolutely superseded by the Constitution. But\r\nthe recollection of the fact excited the zeal of social propagandism in\r\nsome sections of the Confederation, and when a second State, that of\r\nMissouri, came to be formed in the territory of Louisiana proposition was\r\nmade to extend to the latter territory the restriction originally applied\r\nto the country situated between the rivers Ohio and Mississippi.\r\n\r\nMost questionable as was this proposition in all its constitutional\r\nrelations, nevertheless it received the sanction of Congress, with some\r\nslight modifications of line, to save the existing rights of the intended\r\nnew State. It was reluctantly acquiesced in by Southern States as a\r\nsacrifice to the cause of peace and of the Union, not only of the rights\r\nstipulated by the treaty of Louisiana, but of the principle of equality\r\namong the States guaranteed by the Constitution. It was received by the\r\nNorthern States with angry and resentful condemnation and complaint,\r\nbecause it did not concede all which they had exactingly demanded. Having\r\npassed through the forms of legislation, it took its place in the statute\r\nbook, standing open to repeal, like any other act of doubtful\r\nconstitutionality, subject to be pronounced null and void by the courts of\r\nlaw, and possessing no possible efficacy to control the rights of the\r\nStates which might thereafter be organized out of any part of the original\r\nterritory of Louisiana.\r\n\r\nIn all this, if any aggression there were, any innovation upon preexisting\r\nrights, to which portion of the Union are they justly chargeable? This\r\ncontroversy passed away with the occasion, nothing surviving it save the\r\ndormant letter of the statute.\r\n\r\nBut long afterwards, when by the proposed accession of the Republic of\r\nTexas the United States were to take their next step in territorial\r\ngreatness, a similar contingency occurred and became the occasion for\r\nsystematized attempts to intervene in the domestic affairs of one section\r\nof the Union, in defiance of their rights as States and of the stipulations\r\nof the Constitution. These attempts assumed a practical direction in the\r\nshape of persevering endeavors by some of the Representatives in both\r\nHouses of Congress to deprive the Southern States of the supposed benefit\r\nof the provisions of the act authorizing the organization of the State of\r\nMissouri.\r\n\r\nBut the good sense of the people and the vital force of the Constitution\r\ntriumphed over sectional prejudice and the political errors of the day, and\r\nthe State of Texas returned to the Union as she was, with social\r\ninstitutions which her people had chosen for themselves and with express\r\nagreement by the reannexing act that she should be susceptible of\r\nsubdivision into a plurality of States.\r\n\r\nWhatever advantage the interests of the Southern States, as such, gained by\r\nthis were far inferior in results, as they unfolded in the progress of\r\ntime, to those which sprang from previous concessions made by the South.\r\n\r\nTo every thoughtful friend of the Union, to the true lovers of their\r\ncountry, to all who longed and labored for the full success of this great\r\nexperiment of republican institutions, it was cause of gratulation that\r\nsuch an opportunity had occurred to illustrate our advancing power on this\r\ncontinent and to furnish to the world additional assurance of the strength\r\nand stability of the Constitution. Who would wish to see Florida still a\r\nEuropean colony? Who would rejoice to hail Texas as a lone star instead of\r\none in the galaxy of States? Who does not appreciate the incalculable\r\nbenefits of the acquisition of Louisiana? And yet narrow views and\r\nsectional purposes would inevitably have excluded them all from the Union.\r\n\r\nBut another struggle on the same point ensued when our victorious armies\r\nreturned from Mexico and it devolved on Congress to provide for the\r\nterritories acquired by the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. The great\r\nrelations of the subject had now become distinct and clear to the\r\nperception of the public mind, which appreciated the evils of sectional\r\ncontroversy upon the question of the admission of new States. In that\r\ncrisis intense solicitude pervaded the nation. But the patriotic impulses\r\nof the popular heart, guided by the admonitory advice of the Father of his\r\nCountry, rose superior to all the difficulties of the incorporation of a\r\nnew empire into the Union. In the counsels of Congress there was manifested\r\nextreme antagonism of opinion and action between some Representatives, who\r\nsought by the abusive and unconstitutional employment of the legislative\r\npowers of the Government to interfere in the condition of the inchoate\r\nStates and to impose their own social theories upon the latter, and other\r\nRepresentatives, who repelled the interposition of the General Government\r\nin this respect and maintained the self-constituting rights of the States.\r\nIn truth, the thing attempted was in form alone action of the General\r\nGovernment, while in reality it was the endeavor, by abuse of legislative\r\npower, to force the ideas of internal policy entertained in particular\r\nStates upon allied independent States. Once more the Constitution and the\r\nUnion triumphed signally. The new territories were organized without\r\nrestrictions on the disputed point, and were thus left to judge in that\r\nparticular for themselves; and the sense of constitutional faith proved\r\nvigorous enough in Congress not only to accomplish this primary object, but\r\nalso the incidental and hardly less important one of so amending the\r\nprovisions of the statute for the extradition of fugitives from service as\r\nto place that public duty under the safeguard of the General Government,\r\nand thus relieve it from obstacles raised up by the legislation of some of\r\nthe States.\r\n\r\nVain declamation regarding the provisions of law for the extradition of\r\nfugitives from service, with occasional episodes of frantic effort to\r\nobstruct their execution by riot and murder, continued for a brief time to\r\nagitate certain localities. But the true principle of leaving each State\r\nand Territory to regulate its own laws of labor according to its own sense\r\nof right and expediency had acquired fast hold of the public judgment, to\r\nsuch a degree that by common consent it was observed in the organization of\r\nthe Territory of Washington. When, more recently, it became requisite to\r\norganize the Territories of Nebraska and Kansas, it was the natural and\r\nlegitimate, if not the inevitable, consequence of previous events and\r\nlegislation that the same great and sound principle which had already been\r\napplied to Utah and New Mexico should be applied to them--that they should\r\nstand exempt from the restrictions proposed in the act relative to the\r\nState of Missouri.\r\n\r\nThese restrictions were, in the estimation of many thoughtful men, null\r\nfrom the beginning, unauthorized by the Constitution, contrary to the\r\ntreaty stipulations for the cession of Louisiana, and inconsistent with the\r\nequality of these States.\r\n\r\nThey had been stripped of all moral authority by persistent efforts to\r\nprocure their indirect repeal through contradictory enactments. They had\r\nbeen practically abrogated by the legislation attending the organization of\r\nUtah, New Mexico, and Washington. If any vitality remained in them it would\r\nhave been taken away, in effect, by the new Territorial acts in the form\r\noriginally proposed to the Senate at the first session of the last\r\nCongress. It was manly and ingenuous, as well as patriotic and just, to do\r\nthis directly and plainly, and thus relieve the statute book of an act\r\nwhich might be of possible future injury, but of no possible future\r\nbenefit; and the measure of its repeal was the final consummation and\r\ncomplete recognition of the principle that no portion of the United States\r\nshall undertake through assumption of the powers of the General Government\r\nto dictate the social institutions of any other portion.\r\n\r\nThe scope and effect of the language of repeal were not left in doubt. It\r\nwas declared in terms to be \"the true intent and meaning of this act not to\r\nlegislate slavery into any Territory or State, nor to exclude it therefrom,\r\nbut to leave the people thereof perfectly free to form and regulate their\r\ndomestic institutions in their own way, subject only to the Constitution of\r\nthe United States.\"\r\n\r\nThe measure could not be withstood upon its merits alone. It was attacked\r\nwith violence on the false or delusive pretext that it constituted a breach\r\nof faith. Never was objection more utterly destitute of substantial\r\njustification. When before was it imagined by sensible men that a\r\nregulative or declarative statute, whether enacted ten or forty years ago,\r\nis irrepealable; that an act of Congress is above the Constitution? If,\r\nindeed, there were in the facts any cause to impute bad faith, it would\r\nattach to those only who have never ceased, from the time of the enactment\r\nof the restrictive provision to the present day, to denounce and condemn\r\nit; who have constantly refused to complete it by needful supplementary\r\nlegislation; who have spared no exertion to deprive it of moral force; who\r\nhave themselves again and again attempted its repeal by the enactment of\r\nincompatible provisions, and who, by the inevitable reactionary effect of\r\ntheir own violence on the subject, awakened the country to perception of\r\nthe true constitutional principle of leaving the matter involved to the\r\ndiscretion of the people of the respective existing or incipient States.\r\n\r\nIt is not pretended that this principle or any other precludes the\r\npossibility of evils in practice, disturbed, as political action is liable\r\nto be, by human passions. No form of government is exempt from\r\ninconveniences; but in this case they are the result of the abuse, and not\r\nof the legitimate exercise, of the powers reserved or conferred in the\r\norganization of a Territory. They are not to be charged to the great\r\nprinciple of popular sovereignty. On the contrary, they disappear before\r\nthe intelligence and patriotism of the people, exerting through the ballot\r\nbox their peaceful and silent but irresistible power.\r\n\r\nIf the friends of the Constitution are to have another struggle, its\r\nenemies could not present a more acceptable issue than that of a State\r\nwhose constitution clearly embraces \"a republican form of government\" being\r\nexcluded from the Union because its domestic institutions may not in all\r\nrespects comport with the ideas of what is wise and expedient entertained\r\nin some other State. Fresh from groundless imputations of breach of faith\r\nagainst others, men will commence the agitation of this new question with\r\nindubitable violation of an express compact between the independent\r\nsovereign powers of the United States and of the Republic of Texas, as well\r\nas of the older and equally solemn compacts which assure the equality of\r\nall the States.\r\n\r\nBut deplorable as would be such a violation of compact in itself and in all\r\nits direct consequences, that is the very least of the evils involved. When\r\nsectional agitators shall have succeeded in forcing on this issue, can\r\ntheir pretensions fail to be met by counter pretensions? Will not different\r\nStates be compelled, respectively, to meet extremes with extremes? And if\r\neither extreme carry its point, what is that so far forth but dissolution\r\nof the Union? If a new State, formed from the territory of the United\r\nStates, be absolutely excluded from admission therein, that fact of itself\r\nconstitutes the disruption of union between it and the other States. But\r\nthe process of dissolution could not stop there. Would not a sectional\r\ndecision producing such result by a majority of votes, either Northern or\r\nSouthern, of necessity drive out the oppressed and aggrieved minority and\r\nplace in presence of each other two irreconcilably hostile confederations?\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to speak thus plainly of projects the offspring of that\r\nsectional agitation now prevailing in some of the States, which are as\r\nimpracticable as they are unconstitutional, and which if persevered in must\r\nand will end calamitously. It is either disunion and civil war or it is\r\nmere angry, idle, aimless disturbance of public peace and tranquillity.\r\nDisunion for what? If the passionate rage of fanaticism and partisan spirit\r\ndid not force the fact upon our attention, it would be difficult to believe\r\nthat any considerable portion of the people of this enlightened country\r\ncould have so surrendered themselves to a fanatical devotion to the\r\nsupposed interests of the relatively few Africans in the United States as\r\ntotally to abandon and disregard the interests of the 25,000,000 Americans;\r\nto trample under foot the injunctions of moral and constitutional\r\nobligation, and to engage in plans of vindictive hostility against those\r\nwho are associated with them in the enjoyment of the common heritage of our\r\nnational institutions.\r\n\r\nNor is it hostility against their fellow-citizens of one section of the\r\nUnion alone. The interests, the honor, the duty, the peace, and the\r\nprosperity of the people of all sections are equally involved and imperiled\r\nin this question. And are patriotic men in any part of the Union prepared\r\non such issue thus madly to invite all the consequences of the forfeiture\r\nof their constitutional engagements? It is impossible. The storm of frenzy\r\nand faction must inevitably dash itself in vain against the unshaken rock\r\nof the Constitution. I shall never doubt it. I know that the Union is\r\nstronger a thousand times than all the wild and chimerical schemes of\r\nsocial change which are generated one after another in the unstable minds\r\nof visionary sophists and interested agitators. I rely confidently on the\r\npatriotism of the people, on the dignity and self-respect of the States, on\r\nthe wisdom of Congress, and, above all, on the continued gracious favor of\r\nAlmighty God to maintain against all enemies, whether at home or abroad,\r\nthe sanctity of the Constitution and the integrity of the Union.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nFranklin Pierce\r\nDecember 2, 1856\r\n\r\nFellow-Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nThe Constitution requires that the President shall from time to time not\r\nonly recommend to the consideration of Congress such measures as he may\r\njudge necessary and expedient, but also that he shall give information to\r\nthem of the state of the Union. To do this fully involves exposition of all\r\nmatters in the actual condition of the country, domestic or foreign, which\r\nessentially concern the general welfare. While performing his\r\nconstitutional duty in this respect, the President does not speak merely to\r\nexpress personal convictions, but as the executive minister of the\r\nGovernment, enabled by his position and called upon by his official\r\nobligations to scan with an impartial eye the interests of the whole and of\r\nevery part of the United States.\r\n\r\nOf the condition of the domestic interests of the Union--its agriculture,\r\nmines, manufactures, navigation, and commerce--it is necessary only to say\r\nthat the internal prosperity of the country, its continuous and steady\r\nadvancement in wealth and population and in private as well as public\r\nwell-being, attest the wisdom of our institutions and the predominant\r\nspirit of intelligence and patriotism which, notwithstanding occasional\r\nirregularities of opinion or action resulting from popular freedom, has\r\ndistinguished and characterized the people of America. In the brief\r\ninterval between the termination of the last and the commencement of the\r\npresent session of Congress the public mind has been occupied with the care\r\nof selecting for another constitutional term the President and\r\nVice-President of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe determination of the persons who are of right, or contingently, to\r\npreside over the administration of the Government is under our system\r\ncommitted to the States and the people. We appeal to them, by their voice\r\npronounced in the forms of law, to call whomsoever they will to the high\r\npost of Chief Magistrate.\r\n\r\nAnd thus it is that as the Senators represent the respective States of the\r\nUnion and the members of the House of Representatives the several\r\nconstituencies of each State, so the President represents the aggregate\r\npopulation of the United States. Their election of him is the explicit and\r\nsolemn act of the sole sovereign authority of the Union.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to misapprehend the great principles which by their recent\r\npolitical action the people of the United States have sanctioned and\r\nannounced.\r\n\r\nThey have asserted the constitutional equality of each and all of the\r\nStates of the Union as States: they have affirmed the constitutional\r\nequality of each and all of the citizens of the United States as citizens,\r\nwhatever their religion, wherever their birth or their residence; they have\r\nmaintained the inviolability of the constitutional rights of the different\r\nsections of the Union, and they have proclaimed their devoted and\r\nunalterable attachment to the Union and to the Constitution, as objects of\r\ninterest superior to all subjects of local or sectional controversy, as the\r\nsafeguard of the rights of all, as the spirit and the essence of the\r\nliberty, peace, and greatness of the Republic. In doing this they have at\r\nthe same time emphatically condemned the idea of organizing in these United\r\nStates mere geographical parties, of marshaling in hostile array toward\r\neach other the different parts of the country, North or South, East or\r\nWest.\r\n\r\nSchemes of this nature, fraught with incalculable mischief, and which the\r\nconsiderate sense of the people has rejected, could have had countenance in\r\nno part of the country had they not been disguised by suggestions plausible\r\nin appearance, acting upon an excited state of the public mind, induced by\r\ncauses temporary in their character and, it is to be hoped, transient in\r\ntheir influence.\r\n\r\nPerfect liberty of association for political objects and the widest scope\r\nof discussion are the received and ordinary conditions of government in our\r\ncountry. Our institutions, framed in the spirit of confidence in the\r\nintelligence and integrity of the people, do not forbid citizens, either\r\nindividually or associated together, to attack by writing, speech, or any\r\nother methods short of physical force the Constitution and the very\r\nexistence of the Union. Under the shelter of this great liberty, and\r\nprotected by the laws and usages of the Government they assail,\r\nassociations have been formed in some of the States of individuals who,\r\npretending to seek only to prevent the spread of the institution of slavery\r\ninto the present or future inchoate States of the Union, are really\r\ninflamed with desire to change the domestic institutions of existing\r\nStates. To accomplish their objects they dedicate themselves to the odious\r\ntask of depreciating the government organization which stands in their way\r\nand of calumniating with indiscriminate invective not only the citizens of\r\nparticular States with whose laws they find fault, but all others of their\r\nfellow citizens throughout the country who do not participate with them in\r\ntheir assaults upon the Constitution, framed and adopted by our fathers,\r\nand claiming for the privileges it has secured and the blessings it has\r\nconferred the steady support and grateful reverence of their children. They\r\nseek an object which they well know to be a revolutionary one. They are\r\nperfectly aware that the change in the relative condition of the white and\r\nblack races in the slaveholding States which they would promote is beyond\r\ntheir lawful authority; that to them it is a foreign object; that it can\r\nnot be effected by any peaceful instrumentality of theirs; that for them\r\nand the States of which they are citizens the only path to its\r\naccomplishment is through burning cities, and ravaged fields, and\r\nslaughtered populations, and all there is most terrible in foreign\r\ncomplicated with civil and servile war; and that the first step in the\r\nattempt is the forcible disruption of a country embracing in its broad\r\nbosom a degree of liberty and an amount of individual and public prosperity\r\nto which there is no parallel in history, and substituting in its place\r\nhostile governments, driven at once and inevitably into mutual devastation\r\nand fratricidal carnage, transforming the now peaceful and felicitous\r\nbrotherhood into a vast permanent camp of armed men like the rival\r\nmonarchies of Europe and Asia. Well knowing that such, and such only, are\r\nthe means and the consequences of their plans and purposes, they endeavor\r\nto prepare the people of the United States for civil war by doing\r\neverything in their power to deprive the Constitution and the laws of moral\r\nauthority and to undermine the fabric of the Union by appeals to passion\r\nand sectional prejudice, by indoctrinating its people with reciprocal\r\nhatred, and by educating them to stand face to face as enemies, rather than\r\nshoulder to shoulder as friends.\r\n\r\nIt is by the agency of such unwarrantable interference, foreign and\r\ndomestic, that the minds of many otherwise good citizens have been so\r\ninflamed into the passionate condemnation of the domestic institutions of\r\nthe Southern States as at length to pass insensibly to almost equally\r\npassion late hostility toward their fellow-citizens of those States, and\r\nthus finally to fall into temporary fellowship with the avowed and active\r\nenemies of the Constitution. Ardently attached to liberty in the abstract,\r\nthey do not stop to consider practically how the objects they would attain\r\ncan be accomplished, nor to reflect that, even if the evil were as great as\r\nthey deem it, they have no remedy to apply, and that it can be only\r\naggravated by their violence and unconstitutional action. A question which\r\nis one of the most difficult of all the problems of social institution,\r\npolitical economy, and statesmanship they treat with unreasoning\r\nintemperance of thought and language. Extremes beget extremes. Violent\r\nattack from the North finds its inevitable consequence in the growth of a\r\nspirit of angry defiance at the South. Thus in the progress of events we\r\nhad reached that consummation, which the voice of the people has now so\r\npointedly rebuked, of the attempt of a portion of the States, by a\r\nsectional organization and movement, to usurp the control of the Government\r\nof the United States.\r\n\r\nI confidently believe that the great body of those who inconsiderately took\r\nthis fatal step are sincerely attached to the Constitution and the Union.\r\nThey would upon deliberation shrink with unaffected horror from any\r\nconscious act of disunion or civil war. But they have entered into a path\r\nwhich leads nowhere unless it be to civil war and disunion, and which has\r\nno other possible outlet. They have proceeded thus far in that direction in\r\nconsequence of the successive stages of their progress having consisted of\r\na series of secondary issues, each of which professed to be confined within\r\nconstitutional and peaceful limits, but which attempted indirectly what few\r\nmen were willing to do directly; that is, to act aggressively against the\r\nconstitutional rights of nearly one-half of the thirty-one States.\r\n\r\nIn the long series of acts of indirect aggression, the first was the\r\nstrenuous agitation by citizens of the Northern States, in Congress and out\r\nof it, of the question of Negro emancipation in the Southern States.\r\n\r\nThe second step in this path of evil consisted of acts of the people of the\r\nNorthern States, and in several instances of their governments, aimed to\r\nfacilitate the escape of persons held to service in the Southern States and\r\nto prevent their extradition when reclaimed according to law and in virtue\r\nof express provisions of the Constitution. To promote this object,\r\nlegislative enactments and other means were adopted to take away or defeat\r\nrights which the Constitution solemnly guaranteed. In order to nullify the\r\nthen existing act of Congress concerning the extradition of fugitives from\r\nservice, laws were enacted in many States forbidding their officers, under\r\nthe severest penalties, to participate in the execution of any act of\r\nCongress whatever. In this way that system of harmonious cooperation\r\nbetween the authorities of the United States and of the several States, for\r\nthe maintenance of their common institutions, which existed in the early\r\nyears of the Republic was destroyed; conflicts of jurisdiction came to be\r\nfrequent, and Congress found itself compelled, for the support of the\r\nConstitution and the vindication of its power, to authorize the appointment\r\nof new officers charged with the execution of its acts, as if they and the\r\nofficers of the States were the ministers, respectively, of foreign\r\ngovernments in a state of mutual hostility rather than fellow-magistrates\r\nof a common country peacefully subsisting under the protection of one\r\nwell-constituted Union. Thus here also aggression was followed by reaction,\r\nand the attacks upon the Constitution at this point did but serve to raise\r\nup new barriers for its defense and security.\r\n\r\nThe third stage of this unhappy sectional controversy was in connection\r\nwith the organization of Territorial governments and the admission of new\r\nStates into the Union. When it was proposed to admit the State of Maine, by\r\nseparation of territory from that of Massachusetts, and the State of\r\nMissouri, formed of a portion of the territory ceded by France to the\r\nUnited States, representatives in Congress objected to the admission of the\r\nlatter unless with conditions suited to particular views of public policy.\r\nThe imposition of such a condition was successfully resisted; but at the\r\nsame period the question was presented of imposing restrictions upon the\r\nresidue of the territory ceded by France. That question was for the time\r\ndisposed of by the adoption of a geographical line of limitation.\r\n\r\nIn this connection it should not be forgotten that when France, of her own\r\naccord, resolved, for considerations of the most farsighted sagacity, to\r\ncede Louisiana to the United States, and that accession was accepted by the\r\nUnited States, the latter expressly engaged that \"the inhabitants of the\r\nceded territory shall be incorporated in the Union of the United States and\r\nadmitted as soon as possible, according to the principles of the Federal\r\nConstitution, to the enjoyment of all the rights, advantages, and\r\nimmunities of citizens of the United States; and in the meantime they shall\r\nbe maintained and protected in the free enjoyment of their liberty,\r\nproperty, and the religion which they profess;\" that is to say, while it\r\nremains in a Territorial condition its inhabitants are maintained and\r\nprotected in the free enjoyment of their liberty and property, with a right\r\nthen to pass into the condition of States on a footing of perfect equality\r\nwith the original States.\r\n\r\nThe enactment which established the restrictive geographical line was\r\nacquiesced in rather than approved by the States of the Union. It stood on\r\nthe statute book, however, for a number of years; and the people of the\r\nrespective States acquiesced in the reenactment of the principle as applied\r\nto the State of Texas, and it was proposed to acquiesce in its further\r\napplication to the territory acquired by the United States from Mexico. But\r\nthis proposition was successfully resisted by the representatives from the\r\nNorthern States, who, regardless of the statute line, insisted upon\r\napplying restriction to the new territory generally, whether lying north or\r\nsouth of it, thereby repealing it as a legislative compromise, and, on the\r\npart of the North, persistently violating the compact, if compact there\r\nwas.\r\n\r\nThereupon this enactment ceased to have binding virtue in any sense,\r\nwhether as respects the North or the South, and so in effect it was treated\r\non the occasion of the admission of the State of California and the\r\norganization of the Territories of New Mexico, Utah, and Washington.\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of this question when the time arrived for the\r\norganization of the Territories of Kansas and Nebraska. In the progress of\r\nconstitutional inquiry and reflection it had now at length come to be seen\r\nclearly that Congress does not possess constitutional power to impose\r\nrestrictions of this character upon any present or future State of the\r\nUnion. In a long series of decisions, on the fullest argument and after the\r\nmost deliberate consideration, the Supreme Court of the United States had\r\nfinally determined this point in every form under which the question could\r\narise, whether as affecting public or private rights--in questions of the\r\npublic domain, of religion, of navigation, and of servitude.\r\n\r\nThe several States of the Union are by force of the Constitution coequal in\r\ndomestic legislative power. Congress can not change a law of domestic\r\nrelation in the State of Maine; no more can it in the State of Missouri.\r\nAny statute which proposes to do this is a mere nullity; it takes away no\r\nright, it confers none. If it remains on the statute book unrepealed, it\r\nremains there only as a monument of error and a beacon of warning to the\r\nlegislator and the statesman. To repeal it will be only to remove\r\nimperfection from the statutes, without affecting, either in the sense of\r\npermission, or of prohibition, the action of the States or of their\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\nStill, when the nominal restriction of this nature, already a dead letter\r\nin law, was in terms repealed by the last Congress, in a clause of the act\r\norganizing the Territories of Kansas and Nebraska, that repeal was made the\r\noccasion of a widespread and dangerous agitation. It was alleged that the\r\noriginal enactment being a compact of perpetual moral obligation, its\r\nrepeal constituted an odious breach of faith. An act of Congress, while it\r\nremains unrepealed, more especially if it be constitutionally valid in the\r\njudgment of those public functionaries whose duty it is to pronounce on\r\nthat point, is undoubtedly binding on the conscience of each good citizen\r\nof the Republic. But in what sense can it be asserted that the enactment in\r\nquestion was invested with perpetuity and entitled to the respect of a\r\nsolemn Compact? Between whom was the compact? No distinct contending powers\r\nof the Government, no separate sections of the Union treating as such,\r\nentered into treaty stipulations on the subject. It was a mere clause of an\r\nact of Congress, and, like any other controverted matter of legislation,\r\nreceived its final shape and was passed by compromise of the conflicting\r\nopinions or sentiments of the members of Congress. But if it had moral\r\nauthority over men's consciences, to whom did this authority attach? Not to\r\nthose of the North, who had repeatedly refused to confirm it by extension\r\nand who had zealously striven to establish other and incompatible\r\nregulations upon the subject. And if, as it thus appears, the supposed\r\ncompact had no obligatory force as to the North, of course it could not\r\nhave had any as to the South, for all such compacts must be mutual and of\r\nreciprocal obligation.\r\n\r\nIt has not unfrequently happened that lawgivers, with undue estimation of\r\nthe value of the law they give or in the view of imparting to it peculiar\r\nstrength, make it perpetual in terms; but they can not thus bind the\r\nconscience, the judgment, and the will of those who may succeed them,\r\ninvested with similar responsibilities and clothed with equal authority.\r\nMore careful investigation may prove the law to be unsound in principle.\r\nExperience may show it to be imperfect in detail and impracticable in\r\nexecution. And then both reason and right combine not merely to justify but\r\nto require its repeal.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution, supreme, as it is, over all the departments of the\r\nGovernment--legislative, executive, and judicial--is open to amendment by\r\nits very terms; and Congress or the States may, in their discretion,\r\npropose amendment to it, solemn compact though it in truth is between the\r\nsovereign States of the Union. In the present instance a political\r\nenactment which had ceased to have legal power or authority of any kind was\r\nrepealed. The position assumed that Congress had no moral right to enact\r\nsuch repeal was strange enough, and singularly so in view of the fact that\r\nthe argument came from those who openly refused obedience to existing laws\r\nof the land, having the same popular designation and quality as compromise\r\nacts; nay, more, who unequivocally disregarded and condemned the most\r\npositive and obligatory injunctions of the Constitution itself, and sought\r\nby every means within their reach to deprive a portion of their\r\nfellow-citizens of the equal enjoyment of those rights and privileges\r\nguaranteed alike to all by the fundamental compact of our Union.\r\n\r\nThis argument against the repeal of the statute line in question was\r\naccompanied by another of congenial character and equally with the former\r\ndestitute of foundation in reason and truth. It was imputed that the\r\nmeasure originated in the conception of extending the limits of slave labor\r\nbeyond those previously assigned to it, and that such was its natural as\r\nwell as intended effect; and these baseless assumptions were made, in the\r\nNorthern States, the ground of unceasing assault upon constitutional\r\nright.\r\n\r\nThe repeal in terms of a statute, which was already obsolete and also null\r\nfor unconstitutionality, could have no influence to obstruct or to promote\r\nthe propagation of conflicting views of political or social institution.\r\nWhen the act organizing the Territories of Kansas and Nebraska was passed,\r\nthe inherent effect upon that portion of the public domain thus opened to\r\nlegal settlement was to admit settlers from all the States of the Union\r\nalike, each with his convictions of public policy and private interest,\r\nthere to found, in their discretion, subject to such limitations as the\r\nConstitution and acts of Congress might prescribe, new States, hereafter to\r\nbe admitted into the Union. It was a free field, open alike to all, whether\r\nthe statute line of assumed restriction were repealed or not. That repeal\r\ndid not open to free competition of the diverse opinions and domestic\r\ninstitutions a field which without such repeal would have been closed\r\nagainst them; it found that field of competition already opened, in fact\r\nand in law. All the repeal did was to relieve the statute book of an\r\nobjectionable enactment, unconstitutional in effect and injurious in terms\r\nto a large portion of the States.\r\n\r\nIs it the fact that in all the unsettled regions of the United States, if\r\nemigration be left free to act in this respect for itself, without legal\r\nprohibitions on either side, slave labor will spontaneously go everywhere\r\nin preference to free labor? Is it the fact that the peculiar domestic\r\ninstitutions of the Southern States possess relatively so much of vigor\r\nthat wheresoever an avenue is freely opened to all the world they will\r\npenetrate to the exclusion of those of the Northern States? Is it the fact\r\nthat the former enjoy, compared with the latter, such irresistibly superior\r\nvitality, independent of climate, soil, and all other accidental\r\ncircumstances, as to be able to produce the supposed result in spite of the\r\nassumed moral and natural obstacles to its accomplishment and of the more\r\nnumerous population of the Northern States? The argument of those who\r\nadvocate the enactment of new laws of restriction and condemn the repeal of\r\nold ones in effect avers that their particular views of government have no\r\nself-extending or self-sustaining power of their own, and will go nowhere\r\nunless forced by act of Congress. And if Congress do but pause for a moment\r\nin the policy of stern coercion; if it venture to try the experiment of\r\nleaving men to judge for themselves what institutions will best suit them;\r\nif it be not strained up to perpetual legislative exertion on this\r\npoint--if Congress proceed thus to act in the very spirit of liberty, it is\r\nat once charged with aiming to extend slave labor into all the new\r\nTerritories of the United States.\r\n\r\nOf course these imputations on the intentions of Congress in this respect,\r\nconceived, as they were, in prejudice and disseminated in passion, are\r\nutterly destitute of any justification in the nature of things and contrary\r\nto all the fundamental doctrines and principles of civil liberty and\r\nself-government.\r\n\r\nWhile, therefore, in general, the people of the Northern States have never\r\nat any time arrogated for the Federal Government the power to interfere\r\ndirectly with the domestic condition of persons in the Southern States,\r\nbut, on the contrary, have disavowed all such intentions and have shrunk\r\nfrom conspicuous affiliation with those few who pursue their fanatical\r\nobjects avowedly through the contemplated means of revolutionary change of\r\nthe Government and with acceptance of the necessary consequences--a civil\r\nand servile war--yet many citizens have suffered themselves to be drawn\r\ninto one evanescent political issue of agitation after another,\r\nappertaining to the same set of opinions, and which subsided as rapidly as\r\nthey arose when it came to be seen, as it uniformly did, that they were\r\nincompatible with the compacts of the Constitution and the existence of the\r\nUnion. Thus when the acts of some of the States to nullify the existing\r\nextradition law imposed upon Congress the duty of passing a new one, the\r\ncountry was invited by agitators to enter into party organization for its\r\nrepeal; but that agitation speedily ceased by reason of the\r\nimpracticability of its object. So when the statute restriction upon the\r\ninstitutions of new States by a geographical line had been repealed, the\r\ncountry was urged to demand its restoration, and that project also died\r\nalmost with its birth. Then followed the cry of alarm from the North\r\nagainst imputed Southern encroachments, which cry sprang in reality from\r\nthe spirit of revolutionary attack on the domestic institutions of the\r\nSouth, and, after a troubled existence of a few months, has been rebuked by\r\nthe voice of a patriotic people.\r\n\r\nOf this last agitation, one lamentable feature was that it was carried on\r\nat the immediate expense of the peace and happiness of the people of the\r\nTerritory of Kansas. That was made the battlefield, not so much of opposing\r\nfactions or interests within itself as of the conflicting passions of the\r\nwhole people of the United States. Revolutionary disorder in Kansas had its\r\norigin in projects of intervention deliberately arranged by certain members\r\nof that Congress which enacted the law for the organization of the\r\nTerritory; and when propagandist colonization of Kansas had thus been\r\nundertaken in one section of the Union for the systematic promotion of its\r\npeculiar views of policy there ensued as a matter of course a counteraction\r\nwith opposite views in other sections of the Union.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of these and other incidents, many acts of disorder, it is\r\nundeniable, have been perpetrated in Kansas, to the occasional interruption\r\nrather than the permanent suspension of regular government. Aggressive and\r\nmost reprehensible incursions into the Territory were undertaken both in\r\nthe North and the South, and entered it on its northern border by the way\r\nof Iowa, as well as on the eastern by way of Missouri; and there has\r\nexisted within it a state of insurrection against the constituted\r\nauthorities, not without countenance from inconsiderate persons in each of\r\nthe great sections of the Union. But the difficulties in that Territory\r\nhave been extravagantly exaggerated for purposes of political agitation\r\nelsewhere. The number and gravity of the acts of violence have been\r\nmagnified partly by statements entirely untrue and partly by reiterated\r\naccounts of the same rumors or facts. Thus the Territory has been seemingly\r\nfilled with extreme violence, when the whole amount of such acts has not\r\nbeen greater than what occasionally passes before us in single cities to\r\nthe regret of all good citizens, but without being regarded as of general\r\nor permanent political consequence.\r\n\r\nImputed irregularities in the elections had in Kansas, like occasional\r\nirregularities of the same description in the States, were beyond the\r\nsphere of action of the Executive. But incidents of actual violence or of\r\norganized obstruction of law, pertinaciously renewed from time to time,\r\nhave been met as they occurred by such means as were available and as the\r\ncircumstances required, and nothing of this character now remains to affect\r\nthe general peace of the Union. The attempt of a part of the inhabitants of\r\nthe Territory to erect a revolutionary government, though sedulously\r\nencouraged and supplied with pecuniary aid from active agents of disorder\r\nin some of the States, has completely failed. Bodies of armed men, foreign\r\nto the Territory, have been prevented from entering or compelled to leave\r\nit; predatory bands, engaged in acts of rapine under cover of the existing\r\npolitical disturbances, have been arrested or dispersed, and every\r\nwell-disposed person is now enabled once more to devote himself in peace to\r\nthe pursuits of prosperous industry, for the prosecution of which he\r\nundertook to participate in the settlement of the Territory.\r\n\r\nIt affords me unmingled satisfaction thus to announce the peaceful\r\ncondition of things in Kansas, especially considering the means to which it\r\nwas necessary to have recourse for the attainment of the end, namely, the\r\nemployment of a part of the military force of the United States. The\r\nwithdrawal of that force from its proper duty of defending the country\r\nagainst foreign foes or the savages of the frontier to employ it for the\r\nsuppression of domestic insurrection is, when the exigency occurs, a matter\r\nof the most earnest solicitude. On this occasion of imperative necessity it\r\nhas been done with the best results, and my satisfaction in the attainment\r\nof such results by such means is greatly enhanced by the consideration\r\nthat, through the wisdom and energy of the present executive of Kansas and\r\nthe prudence, firmness, and vigilance of the military officers on duty\r\nthere tranquillity has been restored without one drop of blood having been\r\nshed in its accomplishment by the forces of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe restoration of comparative tranquillity in that Territory furnishes the\r\nmeans of observing calmly and appreciating at their just value the events\r\nwhich have occurred there and the discussions of which the government of\r\nthe Territory has been the subject. We perceive that controversy concerning\r\nits future domestic institutions was inevitable; that no human prudence, no\r\nform of legislation, no wisdom on the part of Congress, could have\r\nprevented it.\r\n\r\nIt is idle to suppose that the particular provisions of their organic law\r\nwere the cause of agitation. Those provisions were but the occasion, or the\r\npretext, of an agitation which was inherent in the nature of things.\r\nCongress legislated upon the subject in such terms as were most consonant\r\nwith the principle of popular sovereignty which underlies our Government.\r\nIt could not have legislated otherwise without doing violence to another\r\ngreat principle of our institutions--the imprescriptible right of equality\r\nof the several States.\r\n\r\nWe perceive also that sectional interests and party passions have been the\r\ngreat impediment to the salutary operation of the organic principles\r\nadopted and the chief cause of the successive disturbances in Kansas. The\r\nassumption that because in the organization of the Territories of Nebraska\r\nand Kansas Congress abstained from imposing restraints upon them to which\r\ncertain other Territories had been subject, therefore disorders occurred in\r\nthe latter Territory, is emphatically contradicted by the fact that none\r\nhave occurred in the former. Those disorders were not the consequence, in\r\nKansas, of the freedom of self-government conceded to that Territory by\r\nCongress, but of unjust interference on the part of persons not inhabitants\r\nof the Territory. Such interference, wherever it has exhibited itself by\r\nacts of insurrectionary character or of obstruction to process of law, has\r\nbeen repelled or suppressed by all the means which the Constitution and the\r\nlaws place in the hands of the Executive.\r\n\r\nIn those parts of the United States where, by reason of the inflamed state\r\nof the public mind, false rumors and misrepresentations have the greatest\r\ncurrency it has been assumed that it was the duty of the Executive not only\r\nto suppress insurrectionary movements in Kansas, but also to see to the\r\nregularity of local elections. It needs little argument to show that the\r\nPresident has no such power. All government in the United States rests\r\nsubstantially upon popular election. The freedom of elections is liable to\r\nbe impaired by the intrusion of unlawful votes or the exclusion of lawful\r\nones, by improper influences, by violence, or by fraud. But the people of\r\nthe United States are themselves the all sufficient guardians of their own\r\nrights, and to suppose that they will not remedy in due season any such\r\nincidents of civil freedom is to suppose them to have ceased to be capable\r\nof self-government. The President of the United States has not power to\r\ninterpose in elections, to see to their freedom, to canvass their votes, or\r\nto pass upon their legality in the Territories any more than in the States.\r\nIf he had such power the Government might be republican in form, but it\r\nwould be a monarchy in fact; and if he had undertaken to exercise it in the\r\ncase of Kansas he would have been justly subject to the charge of\r\nusurpation and of violation of the dearest rights of the people of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nUnwise laws, equally with irregularities at elections, are in periods of\r\ngreat excitement the occasional incidents of even the freest and best\r\npolitical institutions; but all experience demonstrates that in a country\r\nlike ours, where the right of self-constitution exists in the completest\r\nform, the attempt to remedy unwise legislation by resort to revolution is\r\ntotally out of place, inasmuch as existing legal institutions afford more\r\nprompt and efficacious means for the redress of wrong.\r\n\r\nI confidently trust that now, when the peaceful condition of Kansas affords\r\nopportunity for calm reflection and wise legislation, either the\r\nlegislative assembly of the Territory or Congress will see that no act\r\nshall remain on its statute book violative of the provisions of the\r\nConstitution or subversive of the great objects for which that was ordained\r\nand established, and will take all other necessary steps to assure to its\r\ninhabitants the enjoyment, without obstruction or abridgment, of all the\r\nconstitutional rights, privileges, and immunities of citizens of the United\r\nStates, as contemplated by the organic law of the Territory.\r\n\r\nFull information in relation to recent events in this Territory will be\r\nfound in the documents communicated herewith from the Departments of State\r\nand War.\r\n\r\nI refer you to the report of the Secretary of the Treasury for particular\r\ninformation concerning the financial condition of the Government and the\r\nvarious branches of the public service connected with the Treasury\r\nDepartment.\r\n\r\nDuring the last fiscal year the receipts from customs were for the first\r\ntime more than $64,000,000, and from all sources $73,918,141, which, with\r\nthe balance on hand up to the 1st of July, 1855, made the total resources\r\nof the year amount to $92,850,117. The expenditures, including $3,000,000\r\nin execution of the treaty with Mexico and excluding sums paid on account\r\nof the public debt, amounted to $60,172,401, and including the latter to\r\n$72,948,792, the payment on this account having amounted to $12,776,390.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of March, 1853, the amount of the public debt was $69,129,937.\r\nThere was a subsequent increase of $2,750,000 for the debt of Texas, making\r\na total of $71,879,937. Of this the sum of $45,525,319, including premium,\r\nhas been discharged, reducing the debt to $30,963,909, all which might be\r\npaid within a year without embarrassing the public service, but being not\r\nyet due and only redeemable at the option of the holder, can not be pressed\r\nto payment by the Government.\r\n\r\nOn examining the expenditures of the last five years it will be seen that\r\nthe average, deducting payments on account of the public debt and\r\n$10,000,000 paid by treaty to Mexico, has been but about $48,000,000. It is\r\nbelieved that under an economical administration of the Government the\r\naverage expenditure for the ensuing five years will not exceed that sum,\r\nunless extraordinary occasion for its increase should occur. The acts\r\ngranting bounty lands will soon have been executed, while the extension of\r\nour frontier settlements will cause a continued demand for lands and\r\naugmented receipts, probably, from that source. These considerations will\r\njustify a reduction of the revenue from customs so as not to exceed\r\nforty-eight or fifty million dollars. I think the exigency for such\r\nreduction is imperative, and again urge it upon the consideration of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nThe amount of reduction, as well as the manner of effecting it, are\r\nquestions of great and general interest, it being essential to industrial\r\nenterprise and the public prosperity, as well as the dictate of obvious\r\njustice, that the burden of taxation be made to rest as equally as possible\r\nupon all classes and all sections and interests of the country.\r\n\r\nI have heretofore recommended to your consideration the revision of the\r\nrevenue laws, prepared under the direction of the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury, and also legislation upon some special questions affecting the\r\nbusiness of that Department, more especially the enactment of a law to\r\npunish the abstraction of official books or papers from the files of the\r\nGovernment and requiring all such books and papers and all other public\r\nproperty to be turned over by the outgoing officer to his successor; of a\r\nlaw requiring disbursing officers to deposit all public money in the vaults\r\nof the Treasury or in other legal depositories, where the same are\r\nconveniently accessible, and a law to extend existing penal provisions to\r\nall persons who may become possessed of public money by deposit or\r\notherwise and who shall refuse or neglect on due demand to pay the same\r\ninto the Treasury. I invite your attention anew to each of these objects.\r\n\r\nThe Army during the past year has been so constantly employed against\r\nhostile Indians in various quarters that it can scarcely be said, with\r\npropriety of language, to have been a peace establishment. Its duties have\r\nbeen satisfactorily performed, and we have reason to expect as a result of\r\nthe year's operations greater security to the frontier inhabitants than has\r\nbeen hitherto enjoyed. Extensive combinations among the hostile Indians of\r\nthe Territories of Washington and Oregon at one time threatened the\r\ndevastation of the newly formed settlements of that remote portion of the\r\ncountry. From recent information we are permitted to hope that the\r\nenergetic and successful operations conducted there will prevent such\r\ncombinations in future and secure to those Territories an opportunity to\r\nmake steady progress in the development of their agricultural and mineral\r\nresources.\r\n\r\nLegislation has been recommended by me on previous occasions to cure\r\ndefects in the existing organization and to increase the efficiency of the\r\nArmy, and further observation has but served to confirm me in the views\r\nthen expressed and to enforce on my mind the conviction that such measures\r\nare not only proper, but necessary.\r\n\r\nI have, in addition, to invite the attention of Congress to a change of\r\npolicy in the distribution of troops and to the necessity of providing a\r\nmore rapid increase of the military armament. For details of these and\r\nother subjects relating to the Army I refer to the report of the Secretary\r\nof War.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the Navy is not merely satisfactory, but exhibits the most\r\ngratifying evidences of increased vigor. As it is comparatively small, it\r\nis more important that it should be as complete as possible in all the\r\nelements of strength; that it should be efficient in the character of its\r\nofficers, in the zeal and discipline of its men, in the reliability of its\r\nordnance, and in the capacity of its ships. In all these various qualities\r\nthe Navy has made great progress within the last few years. The execution\r\nof the law of Congress of February 28, 1855, \"to promote the efficiency of\r\nthe Navy,\" has been attended by the most advantageous results. The law for\r\npromoting discipline among the men is found convenient and salutary. The\r\nsystem of granting an honorable discharge to faithful seamen on the\r\nexpiration of the period of their enlistment and permitting them to\r\nreenlist after a leave of absence of a few months without cessation of pay\r\nis highly beneficial in its influence. The apprentice system recently\r\nadopted is evidently destined to incorporate into the service a large\r\nnumber of our countrymen, hitherto so difficult to procure. Several hundred\r\nAmerican boys are now on a three years' cruise in our national vessels and\r\nwill return well-trained seamen. In the Ordnance Department there is a\r\ndecided and gratifying indication of progress, creditable to it and to the\r\ncountry. The suggestions of the Secretary of the Navy in regard to further\r\nimprovement in that branch of the service I commend to your favorable\r\naction. The new frigates ordered by Congress are now afloat and two of them\r\nin active service. They are superior models of naval architecture, and with\r\ntheir formidable battery add largely to public strength and security. I\r\nconcur in the views expressed by the Secretary of the Department in favor\r\nof a still further increase of our naval force.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Interior presents facts and views in\r\nrelation to internal affairs over which the supervision of his Department\r\nextends of much interest and importance.\r\n\r\nThe aggregate sales of the public lands during the last fiscal year amount\r\nto 9,227,878 acres, for which has been received the sum of $8,821,414.\r\nDuring the same period there have been located with military scrip and land\r\nwarrants and for other purposes 30,100,230 acres, thus making a total\r\naggregate of 39,328,108 acres. On the 30th of September last surveys had\r\nbeen made of 16,873,699 acres, a large proportion of which is ready for\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\nThe suggestions in this report in regard to the complication and\r\nprogressive expansion of the business of the different bureaus of the\r\nDepartment, to the pension system, to the colonization of Indian tribes,\r\nand the recommendations in relation to various improvements in the District\r\nof Columbia are especially commended to your consideration.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Postmaster-General presents fully the condition of that\r\nDepartment of the Government. Its expenditures for the last fiscal year\r\nwere $10,407,868 and its gross receipts $7,620,801, making an excess of\r\nexpenditure over receipts of $2,787,046. The deficiency of this Department\r\nis thus $744,000 greater than for the year ending June 30, 1853. Of this\r\ndeficiency $330,000 is to be attributed to the additional compensation\r\nallowed to postmasters by the act of Congress of June 22, 1854. The mail\r\nfacilities in every part of the country have been very much increased in\r\nthat period, and the large addition of railroad service, amounting to 7,908\r\nmiles, has added largely to the cost of transportation.\r\n\r\nThe inconsiderable augmentation of the income of the Post-Office Department\r\nunder the reduced rates of postage and its increasing expenditures must for\r\nthe present make it dependent to some extent upon the Treasury for support.\r\nThe recommendations of the Postmaster-General in relation to the abolition\r\nof the franking privilege and his views on the establishment of mail\r\nsteamship lines deserve the consideration of Congress. I also call the\r\nspecial attention of Congress to the statement of the Postmaster-General\r\nrespecting the sums now paid for the transportation of mails to the Panama\r\nRailroad Company, and commend to their early and favorable consideration\r\nthe suggestions of that officer in relation to new contracts for mail\r\ntransportation upon that route, and also upon the Tehuantepec and Nicaragua\r\nroutes.\r\n\r\nThe United States continue in the enjoyment of amicable relations with all\r\nforeign powers.\r\n\r\nWhen my last annual message was transmitted to Congress two subjects of\r\ncontroversy, one relating to the enlistment of soldiers in this country for\r\nforeign service and the other to Central America, threatened to disturb the\r\ngood understanding between the United States and Great Britain. Of the\r\nprogress and termination of the former question you were informed at the\r\ntime, and the other is now in the way of satisfactory adjustment.\r\n\r\nThe object of the convention between the United States and Great Britain of\r\nthe 19th of April, 1850, was to secure for the benefit of all nations the\r\nneutrality and the common use of any transit way or interoceanic\r\ncommunication across the Isthmus of Panama which might be opened within the\r\nlimits of Central America. The pretensions subsequently asserted by Great\r\nBritain to dominion or control over territories in or near two of the\r\nroutes, those of Nicaragua and Honduras, were deemed by the United States\r\nnot merely incompatible with the main object of the treaty, but opposed\r\neven to its express stipulations. Occasion of controversy on this point has\r\nbeen removed by an additional treaty, which our minister at London has\r\nconcluded, and which will be immediately submitted to the Senate for its\r\nconsideration. Should the proposed supplemental arrangement be concurred in\r\nby all the parties to be affected by it, the objects contemplated by the\r\noriginal convention will have been fully attained.\r\n\r\nThe treaty between the United States and Great Britain of the 5th of June,\r\n1854, which went into effective operation in 1855, put an end to causes of\r\nirritation between the two countries, by securing to the United States the\r\nright of fishery on the coast of the British North American Provinces, with\r\nadvantages equal to those enjoyed by British subjects. Besides the signal\r\nbenefits of this treaty to a large class of our citizens engaged in a\r\npursuit connected to no inconsiderable degree with our national prosperity\r\nand strength, it has had a favorable effect upon other interests in the\r\nprovision it made for reciprocal freedom of trade between the United States\r\nand the British Provinces in America. The exports of domestic articles to\r\nthose Provinces during the last year amounted to more than $22,000,000,\r\nexceeding those of the preceding year by nearly $7,000,000; and the imports\r\ntherefrom during the same period amounted to more than twenty-one million,\r\nan increase of six million upon those of the previous year.\r\n\r\nThe improved condition of this branch of our commerce is mainly\r\nattributable to the above-mentioned treaty.\r\n\r\nProvision was made in the first article of that treaty for a commission to\r\ndesignate the mouths of rivers to which the common right of fishery on the\r\ncoast of the United States and the British Provinces was not to extend.\r\nThis commission has been employed a part of two seasons, but without much\r\nprogress in accomplishing the object for which it was instituted, in\r\nconsequence of a serious difference of opinion between the commissioners,\r\nnot only as to the precise point where the rivers terminate, but in many\r\ninstances as to what constitutes a river. These difficulties, however, may\r\nbe overcome by resort to the umpirage provided for by the treaty.\r\n\r\nThe efforts perseveringly prosecuted since the commencement of my\r\nAdministration to relieve our trade to the Baltic from the exaction of\r\nSound dues by Denmark have not yet been attended with success. Other\r\ngovernments have also sought to obtain a like relief to their commerce, and\r\nDenmark was thus induced to propose an arrangement to all the European\r\npowers interested in the subject, and the manner in which her proposition\r\nwas received warranting her to believe that a satisfactory arrangement with\r\nthem could soon be concluded, she made a strong appeal to this Government\r\nfor temporary suspension of definite action on its part, in consideration\r\nof the embarrassment which might result to her European negotiations by an\r\nimmediate adjustment of the question with the United States. This request\r\nhas been acceded to upon the condition that the sums collected after the\r\n16th of June last and until the 16th of June next from vessels and cargoes\r\nbelonging to our merchants are to be considered as paid under protest and\r\nsubject to future adjustment. There is reason to believe that an\r\narrangement between Denmark and the maritime powers of Europe on the\r\nsubject will be soon concluded, and that the pending negotiation with the\r\nUnited States may then be resumed and terminated in a satisfactory manner.\r\n\r\nWith Spain no new difficulties have arisen, nor has much progress been made\r\nin the adjustment of pending ones.\r\n\r\nNegotiations entered into for the purpose of relieving our commercial\r\nintercourse with the island of Cuba of some of its burdens and providing\r\nfor the more speedy settlement of local disputes growing out of that\r\nintercourse have not yet been attended with any results. Soon after the\r\ncommencement of the late war in Europe this Government submitted to the\r\nconsideration of all maritime nations two principles for the security of\r\nneutral commerce--one that the neutral flag should cover enemies' goods,\r\nexcept articles contraband of war, and the other that neutral property on\r\nboard merchant vessels of belligerents should be exempt from condemnation,\r\nwith the exception of contraband articles. These were not presented as new\r\nrules of international law, having been generally claimed by neutrals,\r\nthough not always admitted by belligerents. One of the parties to the war\r\n(Russia), as well as several neutral powers, promptly acceded to these\r\npropositions, and the two other principal belligerents (Great Britain and\r\nFrance) having consented to observe them for the present occasion, a\r\nfavorable opportunity seemed to be presented for obtaining a general\r\nrecognition of them, both in Europe and America. But Great Britain and\r\nFrance, in common with most of the States of Europe, while forbearing to\r\nreject, did not affirmatively act upon the overtures of the United States.\r\n\r\nWhile the question was in this position the representatives of Russia,\r\nFrance, Great Britain, Austria, Prussia, Sardinia, and Turkey, assembled at\r\nParis, took into consideration the subject of maritime rights, and put\r\nforth a declaration containing the two principles which this Government had\r\nsubmitted nearly two years before to the consideration of maritime powers,\r\nand adding thereto the following propositions: \"Privateering is and remains\r\nabolished,\" and \"Blockades in order to be binding must be effective; that\r\nis to say, maintained by a force sufficient really to prevent access to the\r\ncoast of the enemy;\" and to the declaration thus composed of four points,\r\ntwo of which had already been proposed by the United States, this\r\nGovernment has been invited to accede by all the powers represented at\r\nParis except Great Britain and Turkey. To the last of the two additional\r\npropositions--that in relation to blockades--there can certainly be no\r\nobjection. It is merely the definition of what shall constitute the\r\neffectual investment of a blockaded place, a definition for which this\r\nGovernment has always contended, claiming indemnity for losses where a\r\npractical violation of the rule thus defined has been injurious to our\r\ncommerce. As to the remaining article of the declaration of the conference\r\nof Paris, that \"privateering is and remains abolished,\" I certainly can not\r\nascribe to the powers represented in the conference of Paris any but\r\nliberal and philanthropic views in the attempt to change the unquestionable\r\nrule of maritime law in regard to privateering. Their proposition was\r\ndoubtless intended to imply approval of the principle that private property\r\nupon the ocean, although it might belong to the citizens of a belligerent\r\nstate, should be exempted from capture; and had that proposition been so\r\nframed as to give full effect to the principle, it would have received my\r\nready assent on behalf of the United States. But the measure proposed is\r\ninadequate to that purpose. It is true that if adopted private property\r\nupon the ocean would be withdrawn from one mode of plunder, but left\r\nexposed meanwhile to another mode, which could be used with increased\r\neffectiveness. The aggressive capacity of great naval powers would be\r\nthereby augmented, while the defensive ability of others would be reduced.\r\nThough the surrender of the means of prosecuting hostilities by employing\r\nprivateers, as proposed by the conference of Paris, is mutual in terms, yet\r\nin practical effect it would be the relinquishment of a right of little\r\nvalue to one class of states, but of essential importance to another and a\r\nfar larger class. It ought not to have been anticipated that a measure so\r\ninadequate to the accomplishment of the proposed object and so unequal in\r\nits operation would receive the assent of all maritime powers. Private\r\nproperty would be still left to the depredations of the public armed\r\ncruisers.\r\n\r\nI have expressed a readiness on the part of this Government to accede to\r\nall the principles contained in the declaration of the conference of Paris\r\nprovided that the one relating to the abandonment of privateering can be so\r\namended as to effect the object for which, as is presumed, it was\r\nintended--the immunity of private property on the ocean from hostile\r\ncapture. To effect this object, it is proposed to add to the declaration\r\nthat \"privateering is and remains abolished\" the following amendment:\r\n\r\nAnd that the private property of subjects and citizens of a belligerent on\r\nthe high seas shall be exempt from seizure by the public armed vessels of\r\nthe other belligerent, except it be contraband.\r\n\r\nThis amendment has been presented not only to the powers which have asked\r\nour assent to the declaration to abolish privateering, but to all other\r\nmaritime states. Thus far it has not been rejected by any, and is favorably\r\nentertained by all which have made any communication in reply.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the governments regarding with favor the proposition of the\r\nUnited States have delayed definitive action upon it only for the purpose\r\nof consulting with others, parties to the conference of Paris. I have the\r\nsatisfaction of stating, however, that the Emperor of Russia has entirely\r\nand explicitly approved of that modification and will cooperate in\r\nendeavoring to obtain the assent of other powers, and that assurances of a\r\nsimilar purport have been received in relation to the disposition of the\r\nEmperor of the French. The present aspect of this important subject allows\r\nus to cherish the hope that a principle so humane in its character, so just\r\nand equal in its operation, so essential to the prosperity of commercial\r\nnations, and so consonant to the sentiments of this enlightened period of\r\nthe world will command the approbation of all maritime powers, and thus be\r\nincorporated into the code of international law.\r\n\r\nMy views on the subject are more fully set forth in the reply of the\r\nSecretary of State, a copy of which is herewith transmitted, to the\r\ncommunications on the subject made to this Government, especially to the\r\ncommunication of France.\r\n\r\nThe Government of the United States has at all times regarded with friendly\r\ninterest the other States of America, formerly, like this country, European\r\ncolonies, and now independent members of the great family of nations. But\r\nthe unsettled condition of some of them, distracted by frequent\r\nrevolutions, and thus incapable of regular and firm internal\r\nadministration, has tended to embarrass occasionally our public intercourse\r\nby reason of wrongs which our citizens suffer at their hands, and which\r\nthey are slow to redress.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, it is against the Republic of Mexico, with which it is our\r\nspecial desire to maintain a good understanding, that such complaints are\r\nmost numerous; and although earnestly urged upon its attention, they have\r\nnot as yet received the consideration which this Government had a right to\r\nexpect. While reparation for past injuries has been withheld, others have\r\nbeen added. The political condition of that country, however, has been such\r\nas to demand forbearance on the part of the United States. I shall continue\r\nmy efforts to procure for the wrongs of our citizens that redress which is\r\nindispensable to the continued friendly association of the two Republics.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar condition of affairs in Nicaragua in the early part of the\r\npresent year rendered it important that this Government should have\r\ndiplomatic relations with that State. Through its territory had been opened\r\none of the principal thoroughfares across the isthmus connecting North and\r\nSouth America, on which a vast amount of property was transported and to\r\nwhich our citizens resorted in great numbers in passing between the\r\nAtlantic and Pacific coasts of the United States. The protection of both\r\nrequired that the existing power in that State should be regarded as a\r\nresponsible Government, and its minister was accordingly received. But he\r\nremained here only a short time. Soon thereafter the political affairs of\r\nNicaragua underwent unfavorable change and became involved in much\r\nuncertainty and confusion. Diplomatic representatives from two contending\r\nparties have been recently sent to this Government, but with the imperfect\r\ninformation possessed it was not possible to decide which was the\r\nGovernment de facto, and, awaiting further developments, I have refused to\r\nreceive either.\r\n\r\nQuestions of the most serious nature are pending between the United States\r\nand the Republic of New Granada. The Government of that Republic undertook\r\na year since to impose tonnage duties on foreign vessels in her ports, but\r\nthe purpose was resisted by this Government as being contrary to existing\r\ntreaty stipulations with the United States and to rights conferred by\r\ncharter upon the Panama Railroad Company, and was accordingly refurbished\r\nat that time, it being admitted that our vessels were entitled to be exempt\r\nfrom tonnage duty in the free ports of Panama and Aspinwall. But the\r\npurpose has been recently revived on the part of New Granada by the\r\nenactment of a law to subject vessels visiting her ports to the tonnage\r\nduty of 40 cents per ton, and although the law has not been put in force,\r\nyet the right to enforce it is still asserted and may at any time be acted\r\non by the Government of that Republic.\r\n\r\nThe Congress of New Granada has also enacted a law during the last year\r\nwhich levies a tax of more than $3 on every pound of mail matter\r\ntransported across the Isthmus. The sum thus required to be paid on the\r\nmails of the United States would be nearly $2,000,000 annually in addition\r\nto the large sum payable by contract to the Panama Railroad Company. If the\r\nonly objection to this exaction were the exorbitancy of its amount, it\r\ncould not be submitted to by the United States.\r\n\r\nThe imposition of it, however, would obviously contravene our treaty with\r\nNew Granada and infringe the contract of that Republic with the Panama\r\nRailroad Company. The law providing for this tax was by its terms to take\r\neffect on the 1st of September last, but the local authorities on the\r\nIsthmus have been induced to suspend its execution and to await further\r\ninstructions on the subject from the Government of the Republic. I am not\r\nyet advised of the determination of that Government. If a measure so\r\nextraordinary in its character and so clearly contrary to treaty\r\nstipulations and the contract rights of the Panama Railroad Company,\r\ncomposed mostly of American citizens, should be persisted in, it will be\r\nthe duty of the United States to resist its execution.\r\n\r\nI regret exceedingly that occasion exists to invite your attention to a\r\nsubject of still graver import in our relations with the Republic of New\r\nGranada. On the 15th day of April last a riotous assemblage of the\r\ninhabitants of Panama committed a violent and outrageous attack on the\r\npremises of the railroad company and the passengers and other persons in or\r\nnear the same, involving the death of several citizens of the United\r\nStates, the pillage of many others, and the destruction of a large amount\r\nof property belonging to the railroad company. I caused full investigation\r\nof that event to be made, and the result shows satisfactorily that complete\r\nresponsibility for what occurred attaches to the Government of New Granada.\r\nI have therefore demanded of that Government that the perpetrators of the\r\nwrongs in question should be punished; that provision should be made for\r\nthe families of citizens of the United States who were killed, with full\r\nindemnity for the property pillaged or destroyed.\r\n\r\nThe present condition of the Isthmus of Panama, in so far as regards the\r\nsecurity of persons and property passing over it, requires serious\r\nconsideration. Recent incidents tend to show that the local authorities can\r\nnot be relied on to maintain the public peace of Panama, and there is just\r\nground for apprehension that a portion of the inhabitants are meditating\r\nfurther outrages, without adequate measures for the security and protection\r\nof persons or property having been taken, either by the State of Panama or\r\nby the General Government of New Granada. Under the guaranties of treaty,\r\ncitizens of the United States have, by the outlay of several million\r\ndollars, constructed a railroad across the Isthmus, and it has become the\r\nmain route between our Atlantic and Pacific possessions, over which\r\nmultitudes of our citizens and a vast amount of property are constantly\r\npassing; to the security and protection of all which and the continuance of\r\nthe public advantages involved it is impossible for the Government of the\r\nUnited States to be indifferent.\r\n\r\nI have deemed the danger of the recurrence of scenes of lawless violence in\r\nthis quarter so imminent as to make it my duty to station a part of our\r\nnaval force in the harbors of Panama and Aspinwall, in order to protect the\r\npersons and property of the citizens of the United States in those ports\r\nand to insure to them safe passage across the Isthmus. And it would, in my\r\njudgment, be unwise to withdraw the naval force now in those ports until,\r\nby the spontaneous action of the Republic of New Granada or otherwise, some\r\nadequate arrangement shall have been made for the protection and security\r\nof a line of interoceanic communication, so important at this time not to\r\nthe United States only, but to all other maritime states, both of Europe\r\nand America.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile negotiations have been instituted, by means of a special\r\ncommission, to obtain from New Granada full indemnity for injuries\r\nsustained by our citizens on the Isthmus and satisfactory security for the\r\ngeneral interests of the United States.\r\n\r\nIn addressing to you my last annual message the occasion seems to me an\r\nappropriate one to express my congratulations, in view of the peace,\r\ngreatness, and felicity which the United States now possess and enjoy. To\r\npoint you to the state of the various Departments of the Government and of\r\nall the great branches of the public service, civil and military, in order\r\nto speak of the intelligence and the integrity which pervades the whole,\r\nwould be to indicate but imperfectly the administrative condition of the\r\ncountry and the beneficial effects of that on the general welfare. Nor\r\nwould it suffice to say that the nation is actually at peace at home and\r\nabroad; that its industrial interests are prosperous; that the canvas of\r\nits mariners whitens every sea, and the plow of its husbandmen is marching\r\nsteadily onward to the bloodless conquest of the continent; that cities and\r\npopulous States are springing up, as if by enchantment, from the bosom of\r\noar Western wilds, and that the courageous energy of our people is making\r\nof these United States the great Republic of the world. These results have\r\nnot been attained without passing through trials and perils, by experience\r\nof which, and thus only, nations can harden into manhood. Our forefathers\r\nwere trained to the wisdom which conceived and the courage which achieved\r\nindependence by the circumstances which surrounded them, and they were thus\r\nmade capable of the creation of the Republic. It devolved on the next\r\ngeneration to consolidate the work of the Revolution, to deliver the\r\ncountry entirely from the influences of conflicting transatlantic\r\npartialities or antipathies which attached to our colonial and\r\nRevolutionary history, and to organize the practical operation of the\r\nconstitutional and legal institutions of the Union. To us of this\r\ngeneration remains the not less noble task of maintaining and extending the\r\nnational power. We have at length reached that stage of our country's\r\ncareer in which the dangers to be encountered and the exertions to be made\r\nare the incidents, not of weakness, but of strength. In foreign relations\r\nwe have to attemper our power to the less happy condition of other\r\nRepublics in America and to place ourselves in the calmness and conscious\r\ndignity of right by the side of the greatest and wealthiest of the Empires\r\nof Europe. In domestic relations we have to guard against the shock of the\r\ndiscontents, the ambitions, the interests, and the exuberant, and therefore\r\nsometimes irregular, impulses of opinion or of action which are the natural\r\nproduct of the present political elevation, the self-reliance, and the\r\nrestless spirit of enterprise of the people of the United States.\r\n\r\nI shall prepare to surrender the Executive trust to my successor and retire\r\nto private life with sentiments of profound gratitude to the good\r\nProvidence which during the period of my Administration has vouchsafed to\r\ncarry the country through many difficulties, domestic and foreign, and\r\nwhich enables me to contemplate the spectacle of amicable and respectful\r\nrelations between ours and all other governments and the establishment of\r\nconstitutional order and tranquillity throughout the Union.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's State of the Union Addresses, by Franklin Pierce",
