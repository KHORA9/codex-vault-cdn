The process of\r\nindividuality has been the cause; but true evolution, whether in man or\r\nmatter, consists in viewing whatever is presented for consideration as\r\nbeing related to all the rest, and as a part of the whole.\r\n\r\nIt will be evident to the careful reader that the various subjects\r\ncontained in this volume were not originally prepared for this purpose.\r\nIn several instances the same points receive consideration, which, while\r\nthey perhaps interfere with the general consecutiveness of the entire\r\nwork, would interfere still more with the construction of its parts,\r\nwere they omitted. For this we have no other apology to offer.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, however, an explanation is due for errors which have\r\nundoubtedly been passed unnoticed. During the publication we have been\r\nvariously engaged and not able to devote the time actually requisite to\r\nreviewing a work of this character. Very much of the proof-reading has\r\nnecessarily been intrusted to others, and we regret that some\r\ntypographical errors have crept in. Those we have noticed are so evident\r\nthey scarcely need be mentioned. In one case evolution has been rendered\r\nrevolution; in another, evolve, revolve; in another, farce, force, etc.\r\nAll who might desire to read part of this book may not care for other\r\nparts. Those who would find food for thought in “The Basis of Physical\r\nLife” might not care to inquire whether the governmental evolution of\r\nthe world has been consistent and persistent; but we trust that\r\neverybody who takes up this book will carefully read “The Limits and\r\nSphere and the Principles of Government,” and “Papers on Labor and\r\nCapital and Commerce,” for these immediately concern us all.\r\n\r\nIn introducing the Constitution of the United States and the late action\r\nin reference to human rights, it is hoped to meet in a manner the\r\nrapidly-growing demand for information upon the Woman Question, and in\r\ngiving it the prominence of introducing the book to our readers, we\r\ntrust to cause further inquiry into the subject of the equality of human\r\nrights. Asking the indulgence of an ever generous public we commit our\r\neffort to its care, with the hope that the Providence of God may approve\r\nit, and that it may benefit that humanity in whose cause I profess to\r\nlabor.\r\n\r\n                                                    VICTORIA C. WOODHULL\r\n\r\n NEW YORK, February 1, 1871.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n             GOD IN CREATION, IN HISTORY AND IN GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Almighty God! Who art alone first cause,\r\n         Of all that Nature works through changeless laws,\r\n         Maker and author of whate’er we see\r\n         That lives Thy life amid eternity.\r\n\r\n         Look back ere time was, and the face of earth,\r\n         Lifeless and still, was solitude and dearth;\r\n         No lovely valleys and no hills sublime;\r\n         No rocks or waters marked the hours of time.\r\n\r\n         Yet look again; behold the grass-clad hills,\r\n         Dew-spangled, multitudinous with rills,\r\n         Yet lifeless still: no reason and no sight,\r\n         That in these many glories know delight.\r\n\r\n         Yet look again; field-beasts and birds of sky\r\n         Range woods and glades mere hunger to supply;\r\n         And time rolls onward, rocks grow old and gray,\r\n         And Nature’s face is wrinkled with decay.\r\n\r\n         Yet look again; Creation’s fullness past,\r\n         And one supreme is born. Man comes at last;\r\n         Man, who to man is what God is to earth;\r\n         God’s image in the soul; in form her birth.\r\n\r\n         Yet look again; Man reaches to his prime,\r\n         Like God, creating through fixed laws and time,\r\n         Must he not, too, through each gradation go,\r\n         Reaching to higher passes from the low?\r\n\r\n         Is not our life breathed forth from God’s own breath?\r\n         Once having lived, can we in truth know death?\r\n         Each soul from birth until the final sleep,\r\n         Must on God’s own fixed lines its travel keep.\r\n\r\n         Then, wherefore, with loud prayer and unctuous face,\r\n         To brother say: “Ye run a foolish race\r\n         To the abyss.” For how shall any know\r\n         Whither God’s ministry shall make us go?\r\n\r\n         Doubt ye the power that governs everything\r\n         That lovely earth from chaos forth did bring?\r\n         Canst mark the line where ceases God’s command\r\n         From work that’s done by man’s own shaping hand?\r\n\r\n         Forever, no! For man is but effect\r\n         Of causes which the Father doth direct;\r\n         Each act and thought and movement of his soul\r\n         Hath source in God, the Infinite and Whole.\r\n\r\n         From earthly things man must his body feed;\r\n         But doth not soul from Heaven its nurture need?\r\n         His earthly frame bound earthward by fixed laws,\r\n         Doth not the soul yearn for a heavenly cause?\r\n\r\n         Brothers to brothers linked, and each to all,\r\n         Live we one life on this terrestrial ball;\r\n         One life of those who live and those who die,\r\n         Of those whom sight knows and whom memory.\r\n\r\n         Those elder brothers on that farther shore,\r\n         Risen higher than we in wisdom and in lore,\r\n         Send messages of knowledge and of love;\r\n         But know we well that these come from above!\r\n\r\n         For angels’ wisdom to the earth descends,\r\n         And each fresh hour some bright, fresh wisdom sends;\r\n         Each day some wonder of new lore displayed,\r\n         Each year man’s mind with triumph new arrayed.\r\n\r\n         Can mouldering relics, or can fossiled creeds,\r\n         Provide the quickening age her mighty needs?\r\n         Can codes, half dead, framed in days long gone by,\r\n         The soul’s new wants, so manifold, supply?\r\n\r\n         New palaces of Science, Faith and Truth,\r\n         Tower o’er the humble dwellings of our youth.\r\n         Shall rule and State, then, in their old ways stand,\r\n         Denying Progress her supreme demand?\r\n\r\n         Yet stand they do, and with contemptuous pride,\r\n         Fling Reason, Progress, Hope and Faith aside.\r\n         Shall the soul’s mighty yearnings thus have end?\r\n         As well with words think God’s own plans to bend.\r\n\r\n         Decrees are sealed in Heaven’s own chancery,\r\n         Proclaiming universal liberty.\r\n         Rulers and Kings who will not hear the call,\r\n         In one dread hour shall thunder-stricken fall.\r\n\r\n         So moves the growing world with march sublime,\r\n         Setting new music to the beats of Time;\r\n         Old things decay, and new things ceaseless spring,\r\n         And God’s own face is seen in everything.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               ARTICLE I.\r\n\r\nSEC.

The actual enumeration shall be made within three years\r\nafter the first meeting of the Congress of the United States, and within\r\nevery subsequent term of ten years in such manner as they shall by law\r\ndirect.

The seats of the Senators of the first class shall be vacated\r\nat the expiration of the second year, of the second class at the\r\nexpiration of the fourth year, and of the third class at the expiration\r\nof the sixth year, that one-third maybe chosen every second year; and,\r\nif vacancies occur by resignation or otherwise, during the recess of the\r\nLegislature of any State, the Executive thereof may make temporary\r\nappointments until the next meeting of the Legislature, which shall then\r\nfill such vacancies.\r\n\r\n3. No person shall be a Senator who shall not have attained the age of\r\nthirty years, and been nine years a citizen of the United States, and\r\nwho shall not, when elected, be an inhabitant of that State for which he\r\nis chosen.\r\n\r\n4.

IV.—1. The times, places and manner of holding elections for\r\nSenators and Representatives shall be prescribed in each State, by the\r\nLegislature thereof; but the Congress may, at any time, by law, make or\r\nalter such regulation, except as to the places of choosing Senators.\r\n\r\n2. The Congress shall assemble at least once in every year; and such\r\nmeeting shall be on the first Monday in December, unless they shall by\r\nlaw appoint a different day.\r\n\r\nSEC. V.—1. Each House shall be judge of the elections, returns and\r\nqualifications of its own members; and a majority of each shall\r\nconstitute a quorum to do business, but a smaller number may adjourn\r\nfrom day to day, and may be authorized to compel the attendance of\r\nabsent members, in such manner and under such penalties as each House\r\nmay provide.\r\n\r\n2.

Neither House, during the session of Congress, shall, without the\r\nconsent of the other, adjourn for more than three days, nor to any place\r\nthan that in which the two Houses shall be sitting.\r\n\r\nSEC. VI.—1. The Senators and Representatives shall receive a\r\ncompensation for their services, to be ascertained by law, and paid out\r\nof the treasury of the United States.

Every bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and\r\nthe Senate, shall, before it become a law, be presented to the President\r\nof the United States; if he approves, he shall sign it; but if not, he\r\nshall return it, with his objections, to that House in which it shall\r\nhave originated, who shall enter the objections at large on their\r\njournal, and proceed to reconsider it. If, after such reconsideration,\r\ntwo-thirds of that House shall agree to pass the bill, it must be sent,\r\ntogether with the objections, to the other House, by which it shall\r\nlikewise be reconsidered, and if approved by two-thirds of that House,\r\nit shall become a law. But in all such cases the votes of both Houses\r\nshall be determined by yeas and nays; and the names of the persons\r\nvoting for and against the bill, shall be entered on the journal of each\r\nHouse respectively. If any bill shall not be returned by the President\r\nwithin ten days (Sundays excepted) after it shall have been presented to\r\nhim, the same shall be a law in like manner as if he had signed it,\r\nunless the Congress, by their adjournment, prevent its return; in which\r\ncase it shall not be a law.\r\n\r\n3. Every order, resolution, or vote, to which the concurrence of the\r\nSenate and House of Representatives may be necessary (except on a\r\nquestion of adjournment) shall be presented to the President of the\r\nUnited States; and before the same shall take effect, shall be approved\r\nby him, or being disapproved by him, shall be repassed by two-thirds of\r\nthe Senate and House of Representatives, according to the rules and\r\nlimitations prescribed in the face of a bill.\r\n\r\nSEC.

No money shall be drawn from the treasury, but in consequence of\r\nappropriations made by law; and a regular statement or account of the\r\nreceipts and expenditures of all public money, shall be published from\r\ntime to time.\r\n\r\n7.

As I happen\r\nto be the most prominent representative of the only unrepresented class\r\nin the republic, and perhaps the most practical exponent of the\r\nprinciples of equality, I request the favor of being permitted to\r\naddress the public through the medium of the _Herald_. While others of\r\nmy sex devoted themselves to a crusade against the laws that shackle the\r\nwomen of the country, I asserted my individual independence; while\r\nothers prayed for the good time coming, I worked for it; while others\r\nargued the equality of woman with man, I proved it by successfully\r\nengaging in business; while others sought to show that there was no\r\nvalid reason why women should be treated, socially and politically, as\r\nbeing inferior to man, I boldly entered the arena of politics and\r\nbusiness and exercised the rights I already possessed. I therefore claim\r\nthe right to speak for the unenfranchised women of the country, and\r\nbelieving as I do that the prejudices which still exist in the popular\r\nmind against women in public life will soon disappear, I now announce\r\nmyself as candidate for the Presidency.\r\n\r\nI am quite well aware that in assuming this position I shall evoke more\r\nridicule than enthusiasm at the outset But this is an epoch of sudden\r\nchanges and startling surprises. What may appear absurd to-day will\r\nassume a serious aspect to-morrow. I am content to wait until my claim\r\nfor recognition as a candidate shall receive the calm consideration of\r\nthe press and the public. The blacks were cattle in 1860; a negro now\r\nsits in Jeff Davis’ seat in the United States Senate. The sentiment of\r\nthe country was, even in 1863, against negro suffrage; now the negro’s\r\nright to vote is acknowledged by the constitution of the United States.\r\nLet those, therefore, who ridiculed the negro’s claim to exercise the\r\nright to “life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,” and who lived to\r\nsee him vote and hold high public office, ridicule the aspirations of\r\nthe women of the country for complete political equality as much as they\r\nplease. They cannot roll back the rising tide of reform. The world\r\nmoves.\r\n\r\nThat great Governmental changes were to follow the enfranchisement of\r\nthe negro I have long foreseen. While the curse of slavery covered the\r\nland progress was enchained, but when it was swept away in the torrent\r\nof war, the voice of justice was heard, and it became evident that the\r\nlast weak barrier against complete political and social equality must\r\nsoon give way. All that has been said and written hitherto, in support\r\nof equality for women has had its proper effect on the public mind, just\r\nas the anti-slavery speeches before secession were effective; but a\r\ncandidate and a policy are required to prove it. Lincoln’s election\r\nshowed the strength of the feeling against the peculiar institution; my\r\ncandidacy for the Presidency will, I confidently expect, develop the\r\nfact that the principles of equal rights for all have taken deep root.\r\nThe advocates of political equality for women have, besides a\r\nrespectable known strength, a great undercurrent of unexpressed power,\r\nwhich is only awaiting a fit opportunity to show itself. By the general\r\nand decided test I propose, we shall be able to understand the woman\r\nquestion aright, or at least have done much toward presenting the issue\r\ninvolved in proper shape. I claim to possess the strength and courage to\r\nbe the subject of that test, and look forward confidently, to a\r\ntriumphant issue of the canvass.\r\n\r\nThe present position of political parties is anomalous. They are not\r\ninspired by any great principles of policy or economy. Political\r\npreachers paw the air; there is no live issue up for discussion. The\r\nonly seemingly distinctive feature upon which a complete and\r\nwell-defined diversion exists, is on the dead issue of negro equality,\r\nand this is to the political leaders a harp of a thousand strings.\r\n\r\nThe minor questions of the hour do not affect parties as such, and no\r\nwell-defined division of sentiment exists. A great national question is\r\nwanted, to prevent a descent into pure sectionalism. That question\r\nexists in the issue, whether woman shall remain sunk below the right\r\ngranted to the negro, or be elevated to all the political rights enjoyed\r\nby man. The simple issue whether woman should not have this complete\r\npolitical equality with the negro is the only one to be tried, and none\r\nmore important is likely to arise before the Presidential election. But\r\nbesides the question of equality others of great magnitude are\r\nnecessarily included. The platform that is to succeed in the coming\r\nelection must enunciate the _general_ principles of enlightened justice\r\nand economy.\r\n\r\nA complete reform in our system of prison discipline, having specially\r\nin view the welfare of the families of criminals, whose labor should not\r\nbe lost to them; the rearrangement of the system and control of internal\r\nimprovements; the adoption of some better means for caring for the\r\nhelpless and indigent; the establishment of strictly mutual and\r\nreciprocal relations with all foreign Powers who will unite to better\r\nthe condition of the productive class, and the adoption of such\r\nprinciples as shall recognize this class as the true wealth of the\r\ncountry, and give it a just position beside capital, thus introducing a\r\npractical plan for universal government upon the most enlightened basis,\r\nfor the actual, not the imaginary benefit of mankind.\r\n\r\nThese important changes can only be expected to follow a complete\r\ndeparture from the beaten tracks of political parties and their\r\nmachinery; and this, I believe my canvass of 1872 will effect.\r\n\r\nThat the people are sick of the present administration and the\r\nprinciples it professes to sustain, is a proposition, I think, that does\r\nnot require to be argued; but as I have now taken a decided stand\r\nagainst its continuance for another term of four years, and offered\r\nmyself as a candidate for the Presidential succession, a few preliminary\r\nobservations on the general management of our home and foreign policy\r\nwill not be out of place. The present administration has been a failure\r\nfrom the beginning; weak, vacillating and deficient in moral courage, it\r\ncommands neither the respect nor admiration of foreign Powers nor\r\nreceives the active support of its party. The general management of our\r\nforeign and domestic affairs does not seem to have risen to the dignity\r\nof a policy; though it be allowed to have been consistent in its various\r\nparts, it has been destitute of that decision and firmness which\r\ncharacterized the victorious soldier who is now President.\r\n\r\nA decided Cuban policy would not only have settled at once the\r\ninevitable destiny of that island, but would also have given republican\r\nsentiment in Spain an impetus, strengthened the South American republics\r\nand exercised a healthy influence in Mexico and Canada. But instead of\r\nthis we have to submit to the consequences of a policy of cowardice.\r\nAmerican citizens abroad are murdered by Spanish cut-throats, our\r\nconsuls are insulted, and our flag is disgraced. This is unworthy of the\r\nAmerican nation, and the people will hold Grant accountable. A giant who\r\nnever shows his strength is neither feared nor respected. On the\r\nimportant questions of taxation, the tariff and the public debt, the\r\nadministration seems to have no settled policy. Taxation, whether for\r\nthe support of the Government or the payment of the debt, should in all\r\ncases be general and never special. No special interest, nor several\r\nspecial interests, should be singled out to sustain an extra proportion\r\nof taxation. And in regard to the tariff the same principle should be\r\nenforced. Whether the public debt be a blessing or a curse, it exists.\r\nCreated to save the republic, it must be paid strictly according to both\r\nthe spirit and the letter of the law. But there is no immediate\r\nnecessity for paying it off. By a proper policy its payment might be\r\nmade to extend through a hundred years, for even beyond that time will\r\nthe benefits its creation produced be felt and appreciated. In older\r\ncountries the pressure of national debt becomes a heavier charge and a\r\nmightier burden every succeeding year, but with us this is reversed. The\r\ndevelopment of our magnificent resources will render the gradual payment\r\nof our indebtedness easier of accomplishment with each decade of time.\r\n\r\nAll other questions, whether of a foreign or domestic nature, stand\r\nillustrated by the Cuban policy of the administration. A bold, firm and,\r\nwithal, consistent national policy, if not at all times strictly within\r\nthe conservative limits of international law, will always command the\r\nrespect and support of the people.\r\n\r\nWith the view of spreading to the people ideas which hitherto have not\r\nbeen placed before them, and which they may, by reflection, carefully\r\namplify for their own benefit, I have written several papers on\r\nGovernmental questions of importance and will submit them in due order.\r\nFor the present the foregoing must suffice. I anticipate criticism; but\r\nhowever unfavorable the comment this letter may evoke I trust that my\r\nsincerity will not be called in question. I have deliberately and of my\r\nown accord placed myself before the people as a candidate for the\r\nPresidency of the United States, and having the means, courage, energy\r\nand strength necessary for the race, intend to contest it to the close.\r\n\r\n                                                   VICTORIA C. WOODHULL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    A VIEW OF THE GENERAL SITUATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                            NEW YORK, November 10, 1870.\r\n\r\nIn national as well as in individual affairs, it is well to occasionally\r\ntake an exact account of the situation in which we are; to balance “our\r\ngeneral books,” to see whether the balance is to the “debit or credit”\r\nor “profit and loss,” and to decide from the results obtained whether\r\nsatisfactory progress has been made. As nothing more than “a journal” of\r\nsuch affairs as we shall take into the account has been kept, it will be\r\nour duty to “post” these affairs into a new “ledger” from existing\r\n“journals,” and also to enter up the new balances which we may find\r\nstanding to the several accounts.\r\n\r\nAt no time since the close of the Revolutionary War has there been a\r\ntime more fitting and inviting for such a work. The whole world is in a\r\nferment, which was begun by the terrific strife into which the course of\r\nevents forced us, and from which we have just emerged through the\r\nreconstruction of an almost demolished Governmental structure. Not all\r\nof the legitimate results of that strife are even yet externally\r\napparent, either in our own country or in the world at large. There are\r\nvarious undercurrents, eddies and outcroppings which have never been\r\ntaken into any consideration; but when considered, the destiny of this\r\ncountry, so long foreshadowed, but which was pretty nearly eclipsed,\r\nshines forth more clearly brilliant than ever before.\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been the arguments favorable for the continuance of\r\nthe institution of slavery, the destruction of it has rendered them\r\nnugatory, and but few of those who once used them could now be found to\r\nfavor its resurrection. The atmosphere is cleared of the cloud it was\r\ndraped with, under its influence, and the radiant sun of freedom now\r\nshines for all, and the star of hope our night was illumined by shall\r\nnow no more be dimmed by the dense fogs that were wont to arise from its\r\nthen already decaying carcass. With its destruction the lives of two\r\ngreat political parties passed away, and left the people with no\r\ndistinct lines of demarkation. It is true that there bodies still exist,\r\nbut the process of disintegration is rapidly going on, and the stench of\r\ntheir decay fills the nostrils of all whose senses are rendered acute by\r\nthe intensifying power of intuitive perception.\r\n\r\nCreation is from one point toward one purpose, the extremes of which\r\ncourse, are beyond the comprehension of human ken. Any fact in the line\r\nof its progress may be considered, and the relations it bears to\r\ncontemporaneous facts determined. A fact isolated from all connections\r\nloses its significance. The comparison of a fact with other facts forms\r\nthe basis of all relative knowledge, and the further this comparison is\r\nextended, the wider the range of this knowledge becomes: while an\r\ninfinite series of facts constitutes the sum total of creation.\r\n\r\nHence, to obtain a substantially correct knowledge of the present, the\r\nfacts of it must not only be considered as facts of the present, but\r\ntheir relations to, and dependencies upon prior facts, out of which they\r\narose, must be traced, so that it may be determined why they exist. It\r\nis not sufficient to simply assert that this or that is thus or so. To\r\ndo so carries no conviction nor prophetic knowledge of what must be\r\nnext, as a necessary sequence. But if a retrospective glance be taken of\r\nthe causes that produced it, it is thus demonstrated why it is thus. If\r\nthe demonstration is placed with the fact, and their tendencies are\r\nexamined, it may be fair to conclude that what they may next lead to,\r\nmay be in a measure predicated. The chief value, then, of an intimate\r\nknowledge of the past is, that from it the future may be foreseen, and\r\nthat the lesson it teaches may assist in the formation of aids to the\r\nnatural order of things.\r\n\r\nIf a tree or plant is desired in a certain place, for a certain purpose,\r\nits growth is promoted by all the means which experience has\r\ndemonstrated will assist. All other growths that draw from the same\r\nsource for supplies, and thereby diminish its fountain of supplies, are\r\ndestroyed; the weeds are uprooted, and if the natural supplies which the\r\nearth and air furnish are not sufficient for its demands, that which is\r\nlacking is supplied. The same line of action should govern in the\r\nvarious departments of nature, and especially in the higher departments\r\nof mind.\r\n\r\nThere is another consideration that should never be lost sight of when a\r\nsurvey of the situation is to be attempted; and this is, that while the\r\nfacts which are to be passed upon bear special relations to their\r\nimmediate predecessors and surroundings, that these with them bear\r\ncertain definite, general relations to the facts of all past time, and\r\nto those that will be in all future time. The present is a part of the\r\ncommon order of the universe, extending infinitely backward and\r\nforward—a part of the line of evolvement, neither end of which can be\r\ncompassed by human mind; and if we would learn well, we must learn all\r\nthere is to learn regarding what we learn.\r\n\r\nIt is a definite and unanswerable proposition, then, that every nation\r\nof which we have historic record, was a result of pre-existing causes,\r\nand led to further effects, and that each filled and performed a part,\r\nespecially its own, which was a natural and necessary result of the time\r\nand place it existed in. By a careful study of the rise and fall of each\r\nof the great nations that have existed and an analytic comparison of the\r\nelements of strength and decay that were prominent therein, and of their\r\nrelations to each other, just deductions as to what the present will\r\nlead to, may be arrived at. If the present is the result of the past,\r\nthe future must be the result of the present, and like it be the\r\nexperiences of creation in the process of evolution from the infinite to\r\nthe infinite.\r\n\r\nGovernment, standing forth prominently as the grandest of all human\r\nconceptions and realizations, has in all times been the representative\r\nof civilization, and the principal means of its diffusion. Bearing this\r\nimpress of importance, it may be well to examine the real significance\r\nof the term, or to find the relations it sustains to society. One fact\r\nmeets us wherever we may search in the past—the fact of government\r\nThough it is one of the universal necessities and accompaniments of\r\nexistence, it is extremely doubtful if its composition is realized to\r\nany considerable extent. Government means control—implies power. No\r\npeople can create government because they cannot create power. An\r\nexisting power may be organized into form by a people, and this becomes\r\ntheir government. This power is not in the individuals who exercise it,\r\nthey are simply its servants. It is not the people who organize or\r\nconsent to it; they are simply represented by it. It is above\r\nindividuals, and is independent of peoples, though its channels of\r\noperation may be modified by individuals and peoples. Thus come all\r\ngovernments, while revolutions are the results of the outworking of\r\nprinciples, through peoples, who are their representatives. When\r\nanalyzed, it thus appears that governments are independent of peoples,\r\nand always exist in some form while peoples come and pass away.\r\n\r\nIt is problematically true, that China was the first nation that arrived\r\nat a system of government at all removed from brute, individual force,\r\nand historically so, that there always was a westward tendency to\r\nempire. After China, India; then Assyria, Egypt, Persia, Greece, Rome,\r\ngeneral Europe and America. Each one of these nations, to Rome, was the\r\nresult of the course of events, begun in China, to the course of which\r\neach succeeding one added its experiences. The progress of this course\r\nof events has encircled the world. It can go no further westward without\r\ncrossing the Pacific and beginning again in China. What is the\r\nsignificance of this fact, or has it no special indications? It is\r\nevident that the old order of nature has completed a cycle, and that a\r\nnew order will be commenced, and that, the new order is to spring from\r\nthis country, and consequently, that we are its representatives. This is\r\nmade doubly plain, when we refer to the fact that Asiatic tendencies are\r\nnow eastward, and that John Chinaman is the new competition our laboring\r\nclasses have to encounter.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be expected that the new order of events, we, as a country are\r\ninaugurating, will be characterized by the element of the old, just\r\ncompleted. It had its mission to perform. It accomplished it, and has\r\npassed away. Its fruit is our Government and the civilization of the\r\npresent. A new mission begins. Are there any sources from which its\r\ncharacter may be predicated? Though the creation has completed another\r\ncycle of progressive development, the common course of nature never\r\nstops. Therefore the same common order prevails now, that did when the\r\nplanes of Iran poured forth its people westward.\r\n\r\nOne of the principal features of natural events has been a tendency on\r\nthe part of all great nations to acquire universal dominion. Each in\r\nturn attempted it and failed, because of the imperfectly developed form\r\nof the government they sought to control by. What are the evidences that\r\nall future forms may not fail from similar causes, or specially, that\r\nthe form we represent will not fail?\r\n\r\nThe first and most important evidence is, that in its organic principles\r\nthe Brotherhood of the Human Race is recognized. All men are born free\r\nand equal, does not mean that all men born in the United States are free\r\nand equal, but that all men everywhere are. This, then, is the basis\r\nidea upon which our Government is built; whether the structure is yet\r\nperfect or not the foundation is, and can never be overturned. There can\r\nbe no higher proposition upon which to build; therefore additions,\r\ntending to perfectability, must be made upon this foundation.\r\n\r\nAnother evidence is, that the world is becoming Americanized: that is,\r\nthe world is assimilating to the American idea of freedom and equality.\r\nHow and why? The vast populations other countries have transplanted to\r\nour soil are in constant communication with friends they left behind,\r\nwho thus catch the spirit of equality and freedom, and become imbued\r\nwith the spirit of our institutions, and thus involuntarily become like\r\nus, while still subjects of other powers.\r\n\r\nAll nations contribute to our strength, and by so doing render us not\r\nonly peculiarly American in character, but cosmopolitan to the world. We\r\nare not only American, but European, Asiatic and African; while each of\r\nthese are becoming American. We are, therefore, the centre of attraction\r\nfor the world, and the world involuntarily recognizes our superior\r\nstrength by giving up its population to increase it; while we repay it,\r\nnot in physical strength, but with progressive and comprehensive ideas.\r\nIn accordance with these facts, patent to every one, it is asserted,\r\nthat The World is becoming Americanized, and that this is an evidence\r\nthat the form of government by which we tend to universal control is\r\nfounded on those general principles which give it that permanency, which\r\ninsures its continuance until it shall become universal.\r\n\r\nIf the order of civilization is observed the same deduction will be\r\narrived at The material universe has had its geologic periods The social\r\nhas had and will have its periods to correspond. Nature maintains a\r\nregular and consistent order everywhere. It is the degree that this\r\norder is understood, by the general mind, that constitutes the\r\nsociologic periods of the world. The first era of civilization was\r\ninaugurated by the Assyrian and Egyptian empires, more especially the\r\nlatter, more than 2000 years B. C.\r\n\r\nThis civilization began to spread in the barbaric world immediately\r\nafter the famous conquests of Sesostris, and continued during the time\r\nof the Persian, Grecian and Roman empires, culminating with the downfall\r\nof the latter, and thus completing the order of civilization made\r\npossible by Egypt. Egypt conquered and levied tribute upon the\r\nbarbarian. Rome conquered, and the barbarian became the Roman citizen.\r\nThe present configuration of Europe rose from the ruins of Rome, and\r\nassumed the form through which a greater variety of power could operate\r\nthan in the previous era.\r\n\r\nNo part of the world but has felt the mighty modifying influence of the\r\ncivilizing power of modern Europe. It has permeated the entire temperate\r\nzone, penetrated the frozen latitudes north and south, and attacked the\r\nHottentot of Central Africa and the Bushman of Australia. It organized\r\nlegislation, perfected and maintained administration and made it\r\npossible for all minds to attain individuality, and for individuals, as\r\nsuch, to rise by personal merit, even from the lowest strata of society.\r\nBy its procreative power a new continent, full of native purity and\r\nvitality, conceived, and a higher degree of life than it represented\r\nburst upon the startled world.\r\n\r\nIn the first era, it was one controlling mind operating for personal\r\nends and aggrandizement; in the second, it was several, operating for\r\nthe same end; in the third, it will be all minds merged in one channel,\r\nto operate for the good of the whole. The first was personal\r\ncivilization thrust upon the barbarism of the world compelling it into\r\nservility; the second was sectional civilization exerting its influence,\r\nfirst upon its immediate subjects, and through them upon others less\r\nadvanced; the third shall be general civilization, in which the utmost\r\nparts of the earth can join in one grand and common effort for mutual\r\nadvancement, its peoples having risen to the recognition of the greatest\r\nof all human facts—the common brotherhood of mankind.\r\n\r\nFrom these general observations the tendencies in the order of the\r\nuniverse must be inferred, and if there is any inference possible to be\r\ndrawn, which will coincide with the present aspect of affairs, it is,\r\nthat upon this country devolves the duty, no less than the privilege, of\r\npresenting the world with a form of administrative government that shall\r\nbe possessed of the elements of perfection and duration; and this brings\r\nus down to the consideration, whether this general indication of the\r\ncenturies does coincide with the condition in which the world is to-day.\r\n\r\nEurope contains but four positive determining powers: Russia, Prussia,\r\nFrance and England, while the remainder of the Eastern Continent is\r\nunrepresented. The Western Continent contains the United States. France\r\nand Prussia have been the contending parties for simple European\r\nsupremacy: the former probably also entertaining an ulterior design upon\r\nAfrica. The policy of England and Russia is more comprehensive, and\r\nundoubtedly includes the possibility of a consolidated Continent.\r\nConsistent with this view, England is performing in India what Cæsar did\r\nin Gaul; and Russia, in Western Asia, what Rome did in “The East.” They\r\ncomprehend that every nation is an object upon which change is indelibly\r\nstamped, and that it will remain so until some one of them shall arrive\r\nat a perfect system of government, which shall be the pattern for all\r\ngovernment, or which shall absorb all government. These countries labor\r\nunder one insurmountable difficulty. All the effort they expend to carry\r\ntheir policies abroad detracts just so much from their actual home\r\nstrength, and they have no fountain, furnishing supplies to make good\r\ntheir expenditure, and they thus expand at the expense of vitality.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this great difficulty, Russian supremacy might be a\r\nconsistent conclusion, could the fact of the rapid diffusion of\r\nprinciples antagonistic to monarchy be left out of the consideration;\r\nbut considered, as it necessarily must be, the legitimate conclusion is\r\nentirely different. It is too well known what sentiments lie suppressed\r\nin various parts of continental Europe—in Poland, Hungary, Italy,\r\nFrance, Germany, Spain and England—to ever make it possible that the\r\ncommon order of advancement should so change as to compel the general\r\nmind from general freedom toward absolute monarchy, as represented by\r\nRussia, or to any monarchy represented by any of the nations of Europe.\r\nThe common course of events will not so change, but it will continue in\r\nthe direction of general freedom, not only in Europe but over the entire\r\ncontinent. Considering the progress this sentiment has already made in\r\nconnection with events which are transpiring in Europe, it is not\r\npresuming very much to say that it will ultimately convert Western and\r\nCentral Europe into great republics, represented by the Latin and the\r\nTeuton.\r\n\r\nSo much for the special situation of Europe proper, as connected with\r\nits local policies. England and Russia have further reaching\r\npretensions, and, by so having, their policies become intermingled with\r\nAmerican policies.\r\n\r\nThe processes of civilization are soon to receive accelerating powers in\r\nAsia. England, by virtue of her great commercial influence, has already\r\nexerted very considerable modifying effect upon the vast population of\r\nIndia. China, by its fickle action regarding foreigners resident there,\r\nis claiming the attention of all interested countries, in such manner as\r\nwill undoubtedly force these countries to use some other than moral\r\nsuasion to compel its people to the common usages of the civilized\r\nworld. Thus barbarism invites the elements which ultimately transform it\r\ninto general worldly utility.\r\n\r\nWith China, the United States has more intimate connection, by reason of\r\nrecent scientific progress, and, with England, will divide the honor of\r\ncivilizing Eastern Asia. American influence, however, will be the\r\npreponderant influence, for the Chinese are attracted to this country,\r\nand the genius of our institutions cannot fail to react through such as\r\ncome here upon China itself. While this process of evolution is going on\r\nin Eastern Asia, Russia will be effecting the same purposes in Western\r\nAsia, and thus these three nations will in due course of time reclaim\r\nthe most densely populated part of the world and add it to the sum total\r\nof civilization.\r\n\r\nThere is a very important and highly suggestive inference to be drawn\r\nfrom the tendency the peoples of Europe have been exhibiting during the\r\npast few years. Italian unity has been accomplished, and German unity is\r\nabout to be accomplished. It is not to be supposed that this process\r\nwill stop short of further consolidations. Continental Europe is Latin\r\nand Teuton, and Slav, and this process cannot well cease until these are\r\nunited under their respective governments. When this shall have been\r\naccomplished, thrones and crowns will have done their work, and the\r\npeoples will be ready to erect the Latinic, the Teutonic, and the\r\nSlavonic Republics, three mighty nations which could in peace and quiet\r\npursue their respective appointments in the path of progress, until a\r\nnecessity should arise for a still wider and more comprehensive unity,\r\nin which, under one head, the three should be united. They who have\r\nstudied the general tendencies of governmental evolution cannot doubt\r\nbut such a consummation awaits Continental Europe, nor that Asia is\r\ndestined to be regenerated as above shadowed forth.\r\n\r\nIf such be the course events must take, what is the lesson to be\r\ngathered by that part of the world’s people who speak the English\r\nlanguage? The location of the countries they inhabit does not so readily\r\npoint to unity, but all their interests will compel it. The nations of\r\nthe world instinctively seek equality of power, or rather, they seek to\r\nkeep pace with each other in acquiring power. In view of the prospective\r\nunion of the three dominant races in Continental Europe, where shall\r\nEngland look for her compensating power, except it be in a unity of all\r\npeoples speaking the English Language?\r\n\r\nIt is true that in this Western Continent there is a new race being\r\nbuilt up, in whose composition all other races are destined to become\r\nblended, and which will inevitably be the dominant and the absorbing\r\nfuture race of the world. However, in the mean time, England’s only hope\r\nfor the retention of an existence, or at least of any general power,\r\nwill be to unite its peculiar national characteristics to the younger\r\nand more rapidly changing peoples of America. There might be reasons\r\nwithout number adduced in support of the suggested course, while valid\r\nones against it cannot be found. The power such a nation would represent\r\nwould be one that neither nor all of the prospective Continental\r\nEuropean countries could hinder from pursuing its predestined work in\r\nAsia and Africa, to which latter division enterprise is just being\r\nattracted by the discovery of immense diamond countries, which are first\r\noffered as the necessary temptation to draw people to it, who shall\r\nafterward find other riches than precious stones within its virgin soil,\r\nas other than golden wealth has been found in California.\r\n\r\nThus, in as comprehensive a manner as possible, is presented the present\r\ngeneral situation and its evident tendencies, which bring us to the\r\nspecial consideration of the present condition of the country, which, of\r\nall countries, is destined to play the most prominent part in the third\r\norder of civilization—the United States of America.\r\n\r\nWe have just arisen mightier than ever from a civil war which was\r\nintended by the world’s conservatism to destroy us, and with a\r\npopulation of forty millions we step at once into the front ranks of,\r\nand into the lead in, the grand march of progress. Our Government is a\r\nnearer approach to a popular form, and more nearly allied to true\r\nfreedom and justice than any other in existence. We have, however, only\r\nto review the causes which led to the civil war to see how far we still\r\nare from a perfect form.\r\n\r\nThis war was either a necessary result of existing causes or else it was\r\na great national blunder. Many who recognize no order or law in the\r\nprogress of civilization, deny both these propositions, and affirm that\r\nthe war was produced solely by the personal ambition of party leaders,\r\nrepresenting the _pro_ and _con._ of the institution of slavery. If the\r\nmatter is viewed from the standpoint of the science of society, each one\r\nof these propositions is relatively true, but neither is absolutely so.\r\nThe war was the necessary result of the growth of the principles of\r\nfreedom within the general mind, in antagonism to special, local\r\ninterests, which evidences that it did arise naturally, out of the\r\nexisting conditions, while the individuals who were prominent upon\r\neither side may be considered as responsible for precipitating it. Those\r\nwho stood by, constituting much the larger proportion of the\r\nrepresentative men of the nation, and observed the growth of the\r\nconflict between the two extremes, without stepping in to control the\r\nsituation, place it altogether in the light of a great national blunder\r\nor crime. Had the circumstances been controlled by this large third\r\nparty, the first proposition would have been true, and yet the war have\r\nbeen prevented.\r\n\r\nWe are obliged to speak relatively of relative things, and to consider\r\nfacts, isolated from the general sum of all facts, and in a special\r\nsense, and in this sense the war was an enormous national blunder, and\r\nshould have been averted by a bold grasping and control of the\r\ncircumstances on the part of the Government and those whose _duty_ it\r\nwas to have known what the result would be. These servants of the\r\npeople, to whom was intrusted the welfare of the country, were utterly\r\nfalse and faithless, and allowed us to be precipitated, entirely\r\nunprepared, into a fratricidal war which cost the common country\r\nmillions of lives and billions of treasure.\r\n\r\nHow much better would it have been had the situation been understood and\r\ncontrolled; had the Government shown itself competent to meet it; had it\r\nraised armies and occupied the disaffected country and then abolished\r\nslavery, which it was finally obliged to do, but which could have been\r\ndone previously without the sacrifice of life and wealth. Such action\r\nwould have exhibited the highest order of statesmanship and would have\r\nbeen the admiration of ages.\r\n\r\nThis examination of the causes which led to the war is made to show,\r\nthat in our system of government as now administered, there is no\r\nresponsibility anywhere, and if we drift into danger and destruction no\r\none is accountable; and also, that it is the habitual practice, to evade\r\nissues which press for solution, by dodging along with small expedients,\r\nhoping the issues themselves will die out or pass away. This has been\r\ntrue of us as a government since corruption first began to find its\r\nemissaries among our legislators, and since, it has continually grown\r\nmore and more decidedly a feature of its administration, until to-day we\r\nstand a gigantic nation without giving any indication that we realize\r\nour power or that we have any national policy other than to be quite\r\ncertain that we do not interfere with any of the nice arrangements of\r\nother nations, or that we do not lend struggling freedom a sympathetic\r\nhelping hand, such as we first acquired life by.\r\n\r\nBy whom are our legislative halls filled? Do we find any Jeffersons,\r\nJacksons, Hamiltons, Bentons, Websters or Clays among them? No! As a\r\nrule, to which, however, there a few most honorable exceptions, there\r\nare all small men with ideas no more comprehensive than the districts or\r\nStates they represent, and who make the purposes of personal gain the\r\nmainspring of all their actions. What can such men thus employed, know\r\nof a great nation’s power; or what her policy should be?\r\n\r\nThere have been two great political divisions of the people called\r\nRepublican and Democratic, the issue between which, grew entirely out of\r\nthe slavery question and its sequel, War and Reconstruction. These\r\nissues are all settled. Slavery can never more be made a party issue.\r\nAll efforts that have been made to galvanize it into life have proved\r\nfutile. The Democratic party leaders have pretty nearly given up the\r\nissue as utterly dead, though many of the rank and file still mouth “the\r\nnigger.” The Republican party has absolutely nothing to make it hold\r\ntogether except possession of place and power, which in these times of\r\nlevying official taxation is no inconsiderable advantage. As for issues\r\nand policies, both parties absolutely lack them. The Democratic and\r\nRepublican parties exist to-day in opposition to each other, simply and\r\nsolely because they were opposed to each other upon the issues now dead.\r\nNo live issues divide them. All of these which are before the people\r\nfind advocates and opposers in both ranks, so that in reality there are\r\nno political parties in existence which represent any question to be\r\nsolved or settled. Nothing could be more appropriate in the political\r\nmusterings and parades of either party than that upon their banners\r\nshould be inscribed—\r\n\r\n                           WANTED, A POLICY.\r\n\r\nIt is evident, if another Presidential canvass passes over, that some\r\ngrand issue must come up to give the people inspiration, and which will\r\nbe of such character as to _divide_ them, not such as would _unite_ them\r\nunanimously; for to this last condition, it is to be feared, we have not\r\nyet arrived _though there may be such things arise as will command as\r\nmuch unanimity_ as Washington commanded; but this could not be, _except\r\nrevolution_ occurs and it becomes the result of it.\r\n\r\nWith a young intelligence such as we represent, no old issues can be\r\nmade to divide parties. Upon such questions as have heretofore been made\r\nthe distinguishing features of political parties, there should be no\r\nmisunderstanding. That there is, demonstrates that the principles of\r\ngovernment have not been taught to the people. It teaches that party\r\nleaders have built up theories which lack the support of science and\r\nprinciple; and in this way all those issues upon which the permanent\r\nvitality of the country depends have been put before the people, colored\r\nand trimmed to suit their prejudices and to shape parties into\r\nopposition. Were all of these issues taught to the people as the\r\nlegitimate deduction of the science of government, and entirely bereft\r\nof partisanship, they would all work together for the obtaining of more,\r\ngreater and better conditions and privileges. To bring about this course\r\nfor the people is the object of the science of society which is just\r\nbeginning to be recognized.\r\n\r\nThere are but three principles by which all questions should be tested:\r\nFreedom, Equality and Justice; and when legislation shall be brought to\r\nthe test of these, and entirely abstracted from partisanship, there will\r\nnot be very much further legislation to be performed. All questions now\r\nundecided, which still remain before the people, such as those of\r\nfinance, commerce, revenue, internal improvements, and international\r\npolicy, should have the touchstone of these principles applied, and they\r\nshould be decided thereby. It should be asked of them, What course do\r\nyou point out which will be consistent with freedom, which shall not\r\ninterfere with equality, and which shall be just to everybody? We\r\nventure to assert that, tried by these tests, not a single line of\r\npolicy which is now being pursued by the Government will stand. Surely\r\nits financial policy cannot; for what is there in it which is consistent\r\nwith the constitutional question of freedom? Surely its revenue, its\r\ntariff system, cannot, for what is there in either which is not in\r\ndirect antagonism with equality?—while we may look in vain for even the\r\nskeleton of justice wherever money can find its way.\r\n\r\nAll this is true, and very much more, and it comes of the departure of\r\nlegislation and administration from the fundamental propositions of the\r\nConstitution. It is also true that such conditions cannot last. The\r\npeople, as a whole, are not entirely unregenerate, though so many of\r\ntheir self-appointed leaders are. It only remains for the people to\r\nbecome fully aroused to the depths of corruption to which legislation\r\nand administration have been carried to demand and obtain the needed\r\nredress. This corruption is not confined to Government, but it has\r\npermeated nearly all corporate organizations, many of which are\r\norganized specially to defraud the productive classes of their\r\nhard-earned wealth. The possibility of this being done is because our\r\nsystem of finance is entirely wrong, and nothing will save the country\r\nfrom general financial and commercial ruin except complete revolution in\r\nthis system. If the ruin comes it will ultimately fall upon the\r\nproducing classes. In other words, the producing interests of the\r\ncountry cannot sustain the inflation of prices which has been brought\r\nabout by speculation, in alliance with fraud, which are the ruling\r\nspirits of the day.\r\n\r\nIt may be said that such radical changes as will depose the powers which\r\nrule us, and inaugurate the reign of principles, which will secure\r\nfreedom, equality and justice to every power, cannot yet be introduced.\r\nWe aver that they can; and further, we aver that unless it is done,\r\nrevolution such as has never yet been known will inaugurate them for us.\r\nThe whole substrata of society is seething and foaming with pent-up\r\nendurance of injustice and wrong, and unless those abuses which have\r\nproduced this condition are remedied at once, the existence of the\r\nGovernment cannot be counted upon. And it is criminal to seek to ignore\r\nthis fact. We must not “lie supinely upon our backs while the enemy\r\nbinds us hand and foot,” and delivers us to destruction.\r\n\r\nIn view, then, of our destiny as a nation, and in view of the position\r\nwhich the order of events seems to have assigned us, we are called upon\r\nto put our Government in perfect order before the constructive part of\r\nthe work of the third part of the order of civilization is to be begun.\r\nWe must be perfect within ourselves before we can expect to become the\r\npattern for others, or expect that others will gravitate to us. THE\r\nREVIEW OF THE GENERAL SITUATION, then, results in the finding that the\r\nprocess of diffusive government has culminated, and that the process of\r\na continuously constructive and concentrating government has already\r\nbeen begun, in which our Government, as the most progressive\r\nrepresentative of the principles upon which a perfect government can\r\nalone exist, is assigned the leading position, and that we, recognizing\r\nthis assignment, should proceed to assume the responsibilities and the\r\nduties which legitimately flow from it; and they are great in the same\r\ndegree that our destiny is great.\r\n\r\nIt was under the realization of what our destiny should be that the\r\nPronunciamento of April 2, 1870, in the New York _Herald_, was made; and\r\nnow, having offered this general review, my Second Pronunciamento, which\r\nis supplementary to and the completing of the first, is laid before the\r\npeople. It is believed that the policy and principles underlying it,\r\nproclaimed therein, will be the final departure necessary to be made, as\r\nthe point from which progress will be continued, until the grand\r\nrealization of the prophecies of all ages is fulfilled, when all\r\nnations, kindred and tongues shall be united in one harmonious family,\r\nthey having risen into the full knowledge of the truth, that whether we\r\nbe Christian or Pagan, Greek or Roman, Atheist or Spiritualist, we are\r\nall the children of one common Father, God, whom we shall ever worship\r\nas the Creator, Ruler and Final Destiny of the Universe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         SECOND PRONUNCIAMENTO.\r\n\r\n\r\n     CONSTITUTIONAL EQUALITY THE LOGICAL RESULT OF THE XIV. AND XV.\r\n  AMENDMENTS, WHICH NOT ONLY DECLARE WHO ARE CITIZENS, BUT ALSO DEFINE\r\nTHEIR RIGHTS, ONE OF WHICH IS THE RIGHT TO VOTE, WITHOUT REGARD TO SEX,\r\nBOTH SEXES BEING INCLUDED IN THE MORE COMPREHENSIVE PROHIBITORY TERMS OF\r\n                            RACE AND COLOR.\r\n\r\n  THE STATE LAWS WHICH PROSCRIBED WOMEN AS VOTERS WERE REPEALED BY THE\r\n    STATES WHEN THEY RATIFIED SAID AMENDMENTS—THERE ARE NO EXISTING\r\n  OPERATIVE LAWS WHICH PROSCRIBE THE RIGHT OF ANY CITIZEN TO VOTE—THE\r\nPERFECTED FRUITS OF THE LATE WAR—THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES IS\r\nBOUND TO PROTECT ITS CITIZENS, MALE AND FEMALE, IN THE EXERCISE OF THEIR\r\n          RIGHT TO VOTE—THE DUTY OF CONGRESS IN THE PREMISES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe time has now arrived when it becomes proper to present the final and\r\nunanswerable proposition, which cannot by any possibility be\r\ncontroverted, that the several States which, until recently, assumed and\r\nexercised the right of defining which of its citizens should exercise\r\nthe right to vote, have by their own voluntary act not only forever\r\nrepealed all such prohibitory laws, but also have forever barred their\r\nre-enactment.\r\n\r\nOf this I have been fully aware since the proclamation by the President\r\nthat the XV. Amendment had become a part of the Organic Law of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nTo bring the whole matter properly before the public I published an\r\naddress on the 2d of April last, in which I announced myself a candidate\r\nfor the Presidency in 1872, and thus asserted the right of woman to\r\noccupy the highest office in the gift of the people.\r\n\r\nAfter that address had had its legitimate effect in arousing the press\r\nof the country to the realization that women are a constituent part of\r\nthe body politic, and to a discussion in a much more general way than\r\nhad ever been before, I published my second address to the people,\r\nannouncing that the XVI. Amendment was a dead letter, and that the\r\nConstitution fully recognized the equality of all citizens.\r\n\r\nIn this address the general bearings of the Constitution were examined,\r\nand from the blending of its various parts the conclusion was arrived at\r\nthat no State should deny the right to vote to any citizen.\r\n\r\nI now take the final step, and show that the States themselves, by their\r\nlegislative enactments, have removed the only obstacle which until then\r\nhad prevented women from voting, and have forever debarred themselves\r\nfrom receding to their former position. It is as follows:\r\n\r\nSUFFRAGE, or the right to vote, is declared by the XV. Article of\r\nAmendments to the Constitution to be a RIGHT, not a privilege, of\r\ncitizens of the United States.\r\n\r\nA right of a citizen is inherent in the individual, of which he cannot\r\nbe deprived by any law of any State.\r\n\r\nA privilege may be conferred upon the citizen of the State, and by it\r\nmay be taken away. This distinction is made to show that _to vote is not\r\na privilege_ conferred by a State upon its citizens, but a\r\nCONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT of every citizen of the United States, of which\r\nthey cannot be deprived. The language of the Constitution is most\r\nsingularly emphatic upon this point. It is as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n                              ARTICLE XV.\r\n\r\n1. _The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be\r\ndenied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of\r\nrace, color, or previous condition of servitude._\r\n\r\nIt is thus forever proclaimed, in unmistakable terms, that _to vote is a\r\nright_ of citizens of the United States.\r\n\r\nWere it an immunity, or even were it a privilege, to vote, those who\r\npossess it could not be deprived of it by any State, for the State is\r\nbound to protect every citizen within its jurisdiction in the exercise\r\nthereof. It being declared by the XV. Amendment that citizens of the\r\nUnited States have the right to vote, the next step to determine is, Who\r\nare citizens? This is also definitely, though for the first time,\r\ndetermined by Article XIV. of Amendments to the Constitution as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n                              ARTICLE XIV.\r\n\r\n1. All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to\r\nthe jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the\r\nState wherein they reside. _No State shall make or enforce any law which\r\nshall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United\r\nStates._ Nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty or\r\nproperty without due process of law, _nor deny to any person_ within its\r\njurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\r\n\r\nThe next point of inquiry is, How is it that the State laws which\r\nformerly did proscribe women and exclude them from the exercise of\r\nsuffrage, no longer _do_ so? Simply and effectively by this fact, that,\r\nby the adoption of the XV. Article of Amendments to the Constitution,\r\nthe States established, as the “SUPREME LAW OF THE LAND,” the fact that\r\nno person born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the\r\njurisdiction thereof shall be denied or abridged by the United States,\r\nor by any State, of the RIGHT TO VOTE.\r\n\r\nWomen are citizens of the United States; and the States themselves, by\r\ntheir own voluntary act, have established the fact of their citizenship,\r\nand confirmed their right to vote, which, by such action, has become the\r\nsupreme law of the land, which supersedes, annuls and abrogates all\r\nprevious State laws inconsistent therewith or contravening the same. The\r\nXV. Article of Amendments to the Constitution is as much a part of it as\r\nany originally adopted; for Art VI., ¶ 2, says:\r\n\r\n  This Constitution, and the laws of the United States which shall be\r\n  made in pursuance thereof, and all treaties made, or which shall be\r\n  made under the authority of the United States, _shall be_ THE SUPREME\r\n  _law of_ THE LAND; and the _judges in_ EVERY _State shall_ BE BOUND\r\n  THEREBY; anything in _the Constitution or laws_ OF ANY _State_ TO THE\r\n  CONTRARY NOTWITHSTANDING.\r\n\r\nThe XV. Amendment was adopted by the several States as a legislative\r\nenactment by their Legislatures, under Art V., which provides:\r\n\r\nThe Congress, whenever two-thirds of both Houses shall deem it\r\nnecessary, _shall propose amendments to this Constitution_; or, on the\r\napplication of the Legislatures of two-thirds of the several States,\r\nshall call a convention for proposing amendments, _which_, in either\r\ncase, _shall be valid to all intents and purposes, as part of this\r\nConstitution_, when _ratified by the Legislatures of three-fourths\r\nthereof_ as the one or the other mode of ratification may be proposed by\r\nCongress, provided that no amendment which may be made prior to the year\r\none thousand eight hundred and eight, shall, in any manner, affect the\r\nfirst and fourth clauses in the ninth section of the first article; AND\r\nTHAT NO STATE, WITHOUT ITS CONSENT, SHALL BE DEPRIVED OF ITS EQUAL\r\nSUFFRAGE IN THE SENATE.\r\n\r\nSince, therefore, all citizens have the RIGHT TO VOTE under this act or\r\nparticipation by the Legislatures of the several States, all State Laws\r\nwhich abridge the right are inoperative, null and void, and the\r\nexclusion of women who are citizens from the right to vote, was repealed\r\nand must stand repealed until the Legislatures of the several States\r\nshall again pass an act positively excluding her. If we again examine\r\nArt XV. we shall see that this right shall not be denied or abridged by\r\nthe United States or any State on account of RACE, COLOR, or PREVIOUS\r\nCONDITION OF SERVITUDE; it is left to be inferred that it might be on\r\naccount of SEX, but this denial has not yet been attempted, nor could it\r\nbe accomplished if it were, for here the XIV. Amendment again comes to\r\nour relief saying, “That no State shall make or enforce any law which\r\nshall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United\r\nStates.”\r\n\r\nAgain, the Constitution is assuredly a contract between States and\r\ncitizens, and Sec. 10, Art I., provides that no State shall pass any law\r\nimpairing contracts.\r\n\r\nArt I., Sec. 4,¶ I, provides that:\r\n\r\n  “The times, places and _manner of holding elections_ for senators and\r\n  representatives shall be prescribed in each State, by the Legislature\r\n  thereof; but the _Congress may, at any time, by law, make or alter\r\n  such regulations_, except as to the places of choosing senators,”\r\n  while the judiciary of the United States has acquired complete\r\n  jurisdiction over this matter by the authority of Art III., Sec. 2,¶\r\n  1, which provides that: “_The judicial power shall extend to all cases\r\n  in law and equity arising under this Constitution, the laws of the\r\n  United States, and treaties made, or which shall be made, under their\r\n  authority_.”\r\n\r\nAnd for all these reasons, the State Legislatures having, by the\r\nadoption of the Fifteenth Amendment, abrogated all previously existing,\r\nconflicting laws on the subject of suffrage, are now forever precluded\r\nby the Fourteenth Amendment from re-establishing any restriction to\r\napply to women, whom the authorities of the United States, in their\r\nsupport of the Constitution, are in duty bound to protect in their right\r\nto vote.\r\n\r\nNow what was the fruit of the late war, which threw the entire nation\r\ninto such convulsive throes, unless it is found in the Fourteenth and\r\nFifteenth Amendments to the Constitution, namely: that grand change in\r\nthe fundamental laws which declares _who_ are citizens and what are\r\ntheir _rights_, _privileges_ and immunities, which cannot be abridged?\r\nWill any one pretend that these great enactments can be understood to\r\nmean less than the language thereof plainly conveys? Or will any one\r\nclaim that the old, absurd State laws, which were sunk in oblivion by\r\nthe adoption of these amendments to the Constitution, are still in\r\nforce? Who will _dare_ to say, in the face of these plainly worded\r\namendments, which have such an unmistakable meaning, that the women of\r\nAmerica shall not enjoy their emancipation as well as the black slave?\r\n\r\nWOMEN HAVE THE RIGHT TO VOTE! It is the duty of the Government to see\r\nthat they are not denied the right to exercise it, and, to secure the\r\nnecessary action of Congress in the premises, I did, on the 21st day of\r\nDecember, 1870, memorialize Congress as recorded in the Congressional\r\n_Globe_, December 22, 1870.\r\n\r\nIn the Senate:\r\n\r\nMr. Harris presented the memorial of Victoria C. Woodhull, praying for\r\nthe passage of such laws as may be necessary and proper for carrying\r\ninto execution the right vested by the Constitution in the citizens of\r\nthe United States to vote without regard to sex; which was referred to\r\nthe Committee on the Judiciary and ordered to be printed.\r\n\r\nIn the House:\r\n\r\nMr. Julian—I ask unanimous consent to present at this time and have\r\nprinted in the _Globe_ the memorial of Victoria C. Woodhull, claiming\r\nthe right of suffrage under the XIV. and XV. Articles of Amendments to\r\nthe Constitution of the United States, and asking for the enactment of\r\nthe necessary and appropriate legislation to guarantee the exercise of\r\nthat right to the women of the United States. I also ask that the\r\npetition be referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.\r\n\r\nNo objection was made, and it was ordered accordingly.\r\n\r\nThe petition is as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n                 THE MEMORIAL OF VICTORIA C. WOODHULL,\r\n\r\n  _To the Honorable the Senate and House of Representatives of the\r\n      United States in Congress assembled, respectfully showeth_:\r\n\r\nThat she was born in the State of Ohio, and is above the age of\r\ntwenty-one years; that she has resided in the State of New York during\r\nthe past three years; that she is still a resident thereof, and that she\r\nis a citizen of the United States, as declared by the XIV. Article of\r\nAmendments to the Constitution of the United States.\r\n\r\nThat since the adoption of the XV. Article of Amendments to the\r\nConstitution, neither the State of New York nor any other State, nor any\r\nTerritory, has passed any law to abridge the right of any citizen of the\r\nUnited States to vote, as established by said article, neither on\r\naccount of sex or otherwise:\r\n\r\nThat, nevertheless, the right to vote is denied to women citizens of the\r\nUnited States by the operation of Election Laws in the several States\r\nand Territories, which laws were enacted prior to the adoption of the\r\nsaid XV. Article, and which are inconsistent with the Constitution as\r\namended, and, therefore, are void and of no effect; but which, being\r\nstill enforced by the said States and Territories, render the\r\nConstitution inoperative as regards the right of women citizens to vote:\r\n\r\nAnd whereas, Article VI., Section 2, declares “That this Constitution,\r\nand the laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance\r\nthereof, and all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the\r\nauthority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land;\r\nand all judges in every State shall be bound thereby, anything in the\r\nConstitution and laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding:” And\r\nwhereas, no distinction between citizens is made in the Constitution of\r\nthe United States on account of sex; but the XV. Article of Amendments\r\nto it provides that “No State shall make or enforce any law which shall\r\nabridge the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States,\r\nnor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of\r\nthe laws:”\r\n\r\nAnd whereas, Congress has power to make laws which shall be necessary\r\nand proper for carrying into execution all powers vested by the\r\nConstitution in the Government of the United States; and to make or\r\nalter all regulations in relation to holding elections for senators or\r\nrepresentatives, and especially to enforce, by appropriate legislation,\r\nthe provisions of the said XIV. Article:\r\n\r\nAnd whereas, the continuance of the enforcement of said local election\r\nlaws, denying and abridging the Right of Citizens to Vote on account of\r\nsex, is a grievance to your memorialist and to various other persons,\r\ncitizens of the United States, being women,—\r\n\r\nTherefore, your memorialist would most respectfully petition your\r\nHonorable Bodies to make such laws as in the wisdom of Congress shall be\r\nnecessary and proper for carrying into execution the right vested by the\r\nConstitution in the citizens of the United States to vote, without\r\nregard to sex.\r\n\r\nAnd your memorialist will ever pray.\r\n\r\n                                                   VICTORIA C. WOODHULL.\r\n\r\n Dated NEW YORK CITY, _December 19, 1870_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis memorial having been referred to the Judiciary Committee, I then\r\nprepared and submitted the following legal deductions in support\r\nthereof:\r\n\r\n\r\n                        CONSTITUTIONAL EQUALITY.\r\n\r\n  TO THE HON. THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEES OF THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE OF\r\n      REPRESENTATIVES OF THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES:\r\n\r\nThe undersigned, VICTORIA C. WOODHULL, having most respectfully\r\nmemorialized Congress for the passage of such laws as in its wisdom\r\nshall seem necessary and proper to carry into effect the rights vested\r\nby the Constitution of the United States in the citizens to vote,\r\nwithout regard to sex, begs leave to submit to your honorable body the\r\nfollowing in favor of her prayer in said Memorial which has been\r\nreferred to your Committee:\r\n\r\nThe public law of the world is founded upon the conceded fact that\r\nsovereignty cannot be forfeited or renounced. The sovereign power of\r\nthis country is perpetual in the politically-organized people of the\r\nUnited States, and can neither be relinquished nor abandoned by any\r\nportion of them. The people in this Republic who confer sovereignty are\r\nits citizens: in a monarchy the people are the subjects of sovereignty.\r\nAll citizens of a republic by rightful act or implication confer\r\nsovereign power. All people of a monarchy are subjects who exist under\r\nits supreme shield and enjoy its immunities.\r\n\r\nThe subject of a monarch takes municipal immunities from the sovereign\r\nas a gracious favor; but the woman citizen of this country has the\r\ninalienable “sovereign” right of self-government in _her own proper\r\nperson_. Those who look upon woman’s status by the dim light of the\r\ncommon law, which unfolded itself under the feudal and military\r\ninstitutions that establish right upon physical power, cannot find any\r\nanalogy in the status of the woman citizen of this country, _where the\r\nbroad sunshine of our Constitution has enfranchised all_.\r\n\r\nAs sovereignty cannot be forfeited, relinquished or abandoned, those\r\nfrom whom it flows—the citizens—are equal in conferring the power, and\r\nshould be equal in the enjoyment of its benefits and in the exercise of\r\nits rights and privileges.\r\n\r\nOne portion of citizens have no power to deprive another portion of\r\nrights and privileges such as are possessed and exercised by themselves.\r\nThe male citizen has no more right to deprive the female citizen of the\r\nfree, public, political expression of opinion than the female citizen\r\nhas to deprive the male citizen thereof.\r\n\r\nThe sovereign will of the people is expressed in our written\r\nConstitution, which is the supreme law of the land. The Constitution\r\nmakes no distinction of sex. The Constitution defines a woman born or\r\nnaturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction\r\nthereof, to be a citizen. It recognizes the right of citizens to vote.\r\nIt declares that the right of citizens of the United States to vote\r\nshall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on\r\naccount of “race, color or previous condition of servitude.”\r\n\r\nWomen, white and black, belong to races; although to different races. A\r\nrace of people comprises all the people, male and female. The right to\r\nvote cannot be denied on account of race. All people included in the\r\nterm race have the right to vote, unless otherwise prohibited.\r\n\r\nWomen of all races are white, black or some intermediate color. Color\r\ncomprises all people, of all races and both sexes. The right to vote\r\ncannot be denied on account of color. All people included in the term\r\ncolor have the right to vote unless otherwise prohibited.\r\n\r\nWith the right to vote sex has nothing to do. Race and color include all\r\npeople of both sexes. All people of both sexes have the right to vote,\r\nunless prohibited by special limiting terms less comprehensive than race\r\nor color. No such limiting terms exist in the Constitution.\r\n\r\nWomen, white and black, have from time immemorial groaned under what is\r\nproperly termed in the Constitution “previous condition of servitude.”\r\n\r\nWomen are the equals of men before the law, and are equal in all their\r\nrights as citizens.\r\n\r\nWomen are debarred from voting in some parts of the United States,\r\nalthough they are allowed to exercise that right elsewhere.\r\n\r\nWomen were formerly permitted to vote in places where they are now\r\ndebarred therefrom.\r\n\r\nThe Naturalization Laws of the United States expressly provide for the\r\nnaturalization of women.\r\n\r\nBut the right to vote has only lately been distinctly declared by the\r\nConstitution to be inalienable, under three distinct conditions—in all\r\nof which woman is distinctly embraced.\r\n\r\nThe citizen who is taxed should also have a voice in the subject matter\r\nof taxation. “No taxation without representation” is a right which was\r\nfundamentally established at the very birth of our country’s\r\nindependence; and by what ethics does any free government impose taxes\r\non women without giving them a voice upon the subject or a participation\r\nin the public declaration as to how and by whom these taxes shall be\r\napplied for common public use?\r\n\r\nWomen are free to own and to control property, separate and apart from\r\nmales, and they are held responsible in their own proper persons, in\r\nevery particular, as well as men, in and out of court.\r\n\r\nWomen have the same inalienable right to life, liberty and the _pursuit\r\nof_ happiness that men have. Why have they not this right politically,\r\nas well as men?\r\n\r\nWomen constitute a majority of the people of this country—they hold vast\r\nportions of the nation’s wealth and pay a proportionate share of the\r\ntaxes. They are intrusted with the most holy duties and the most vital\r\nresponsibilities of society; they bear, rear and educate men; they train\r\nand mould their characters; they inspire the noblest impulses in men;\r\nthey often hold the accumulated fortunes of a man’s life for the safety\r\nof the family and as guardians of the infants, and yet they are debarred\r\nfrom uttering any opinion, by public vote, as to the management by\r\npublic servants of these interests; they are the secret counsellors, the\r\nbest advisers, the most devoted aids in the most trying periods of men’s\r\nlives, and yet men shrink from trusting them in the common questions of\r\nordinary politics. Men trust women in the market, in the shop, on the\r\nhighway and the railroad, and in all other public places and assemblies,\r\nbut when they propose to carry a slip of paper with a name upon it to\r\nthe polls, they fear them. Nevertheless, as citizens women have the\r\nright to vote; they are part and parcel of that great element in which\r\nthe sovereign power of the land had birth: and it is by usurpation only\r\nthat men debar them from their right to vote. The American nation, in\r\nits march onward and upward, cannot publicly choke the intellectual and\r\npolitical activity of half its citizens by narrow statutes. The will of\r\nthe entire people is the true basis of republican government, and a free\r\nexpression of that will by the public vote of all citizens, without\r\ndistinctions of race, color, occupation or sex, is the only means by\r\nwhich that will can be ascertained. As the world has advanced in\r\ncivilization and culture; as mind has risen in its dominion over matter;\r\nas the principle of justice and moral right has gained sway, and merely\r\nphysically organized power has yielded thereto; as the might of right\r\nhas supplanted the right of might, so have the rights of women become\r\nmore fully recognized, and that recognition is the result of the\r\ndevelopment of the minds of men, which through the ages she has\r\npolished, and thereby heightened the lustre of civilization.\r\n\r\nIt was reserved for our great country to recognize by constitutional\r\nenactment that political equality of all citizens which religion,\r\naffection, and common sense should have long since accorded; it was\r\nreserved for America to sweep away the mist of prejudice and ignorance,\r\nand that chivalric condescension of a darker age, for in the language of\r\nHoly Writ, “The night is far spent, the day is at hand, let us therefore\r\ncast off the work of darkness, and let us put on the armor of light. Let\r\nus walk honestly as in the day.”\r\n\r\nIt may be argued against the proposition that there still remains upon\r\nthe statute books of some States the word “male” to an exclusion, but as\r\nthe Constitution in its paramount character can only be read by the\r\nlight of the established principle, _ita lex Scripta est_; and as the\r\nsubject of sex is not mentioned and the Constitution is not limited\r\neither in terms or by necessary implication in the general rights of\r\ncitizens to vote, this right cannot be limited on account of anything in\r\nthe spirit of inferior or previous enactments upon a subject which is\r\nnot mentioned in the supreme law. A different construction would destroy\r\na vested right in a portion of the citizens, and this no legislature has\r\na right to do without compensation, and nothing can compensate a citizen\r\nfor the loss of his or her suffrage—its value is equal to the value of\r\nlife. Neither can it be presumed that women are to be kept from the\r\npolls as a mere police regulation: it is to be hoped, at least, that\r\npolice regulations in their case need not be very active. The effect of\r\nthe amendments to the Constitution must be to annul the power over this\r\nsubject in the States whether past, present or future, which is contrary\r\nto the amendments. The amendments would even arrest the action of the\r\nSupreme Court in cases pending before it prior to their adoption, and\r\noperate as an absolute prohibition to the exercise of any other\r\njurisdiction than merely to dismiss the suit.\r\n\r\n3 Dall., 382; 6 Wheaton, 405; 9 Id., 868; 3d Circ., Pa., 1832.\r\n\r\nAnd if the restrictions contained in the Constitution as to color, race\r\nor servitude, were designed to limit the State governments in reference\r\nto their own citizens, and were intended to operate also as restrictions\r\non the Federal power, and to prevent interference with the rights of the\r\nState and its citizens, how then can the State restrict citizens of the\r\nUnited States in the exercise of rights not mentioned in any restrictive\r\nclause in reference to actions on the part of those citizens having\r\nreference solely to the necessary functions of the General Government,\r\nsuch as the election of representatives and senators to Congress, whose\r\nelection the Constitution expressly gives Congress the power to\r\nregulate?\r\n\r\nS.

WOODHULL.\r\n\r\n Dated NEW YORK, January 2, 1871.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe issue upon the question of female suffrage being thus definitely and\r\nclearly set forth, and its rights inalienably vested in woman, a\r\nbrighter future dawns upon the country. When Congress shall have moved\r\nin the matter, and thus secured to woman the free exercise of these\r\nnewly-defined rights, she can unite in purifying the elements of\r\npolitical strife—in restoring the Government to pristine integrity,\r\nstrength and vigor. To do this, many reforms become of absolute\r\nnecessity. Prominent among these are—\r\n\r\nA reform in representation by which all Legislative Bodies and the\r\nPresidential Electoral College shall be so elected that minorities as\r\nwell as majorities shall have direct representation.\r\n\r\nA complete reform in Executive and Departmental conduct, by which the\r\nPresident and the Secretaries of the United States, and the Governors\r\nand State Officers shall be forced to recognize that they are the\r\nservants of the people, appointed to attend to the business of the\r\npeople, and not for the purpose of perpetuating their official\r\npositions, or of securing the plunder of public trusts for the\r\nenrichment of their political adherents and supporters.\r\n\r\nA reform in the tenure of office, by which the Presidency shall be\r\nlimited to one term, with a retiring life pension, and a permanent seat\r\nin the Federal Senate, where his Presidential experience may become\r\nserviceable to the nation, and on the dignity and life emolument of\r\nPresidential Senator he shall be placed above all other political\r\nposition, and be excluded from all professional pursuits.\r\n\r\nA radical reform in our Civil Service, by which the Government, in its\r\nexecutive capacity, shall at all times secure faithful and efficient\r\nofficers, and the people trustworthy servants, whose appointment shall\r\nbe entirely removed from, and be made independent of, the influence and\r\ncontrol of the legislative branch of the Government, and who shall be\r\nremoved for “cause” only, and who shall be held strictly to frequent\r\npublic accounting to superiors for all their official transactions,\r\nwhich shall forever dispose of the corrupt practices induced by the\r\nallurements of the motto of present political parties, that “to the\r\nvictor belong the spoils,” which is a remnant of arbitrarily assumed\r\nauthority, unworthy of a government emanating from the whole people.\r\n\r\nA reform in our systems of finance, by which the arbitrary standard of\r\nancient and feudal despotisms shall be removed; by which the true source\r\nof wealth shall become the basis and the security of a national\r\ncurrency, which shall be made convertible into a National Bond bearing\r\nsuch an interest, while in the hands of the people, as shall secure an\r\nequilibrium between the demands of all the varieties of exchanges and\r\nthe supply of money to effect them with, the Bond being also convertible\r\nat pleasure into money again, by which system of adjustment, “plethora”\r\nequally with “tightness” shall be banished from the financial centres of\r\nour country; and which, in its practical workings, shall secure such\r\npecuniary equality between the employing and the laboring classes as\r\nwill forever make poverty and its long list of consequent ills\r\nimpossible in our country; and which shall suggest the solution of those\r\nschemes which are being discussed for “funding the public debt” at a\r\nlower rate of interest.\r\n\r\nA complete reform in our system of Internal improvements, which connect\r\nand bind together the several States in commercial unity, to the end\r\nthat they shall be conducted so as to administer to the best interests\r\nof the whole people, for whose benefit they were first permitted, and\r\nare now protected; by which the General Government, in the use of its\r\npostal powers, and in the exercise of its duties in regulating commerce\r\nbetween the States, shall secure the transportation of passengers,\r\nmerchandise and the mails, from one extremity of the country to the\r\nopposite, and throughout its whole area, at the actual cost of\r\nmaintaining such improvements, plus legitimate interest upon their\r\noriginal cost of construction, thus converting them into public\r\nbenefits, instead of their remaining, as now, hereditary taxes upon the\r\nindustries of the country, by which, if continued, a few favored\r\nindividuals are likely to become the actual rulers of the country.\r\n\r\nA complete reform in commercial and navigation laws, by which American\r\nbuilt or purchased ships and American seamen shall be practically\r\nprotected by the admission of all that is required for construction of\r\nthe first, or the use and maintenance of either, free in bond or on\r\nboard.\r\n\r\nA reform in the relations of the employer and employed, by which shall\r\nbe secured the practice of the great natural law, of one-third of time\r\nto labor, one-third to recreation and one-third to rest, that by this,\r\nintellectual improvement and physical development may go on to that\r\nperfection which the Almighty Creator designed.\r\n\r\nA reform in the principles of protection and revenue, by which the\r\nlargest home and foreign demand shall be created and sustained for\r\nproducts of American industry of every kind; by which this industry\r\nshall be freed from the ruinous effects consequent upon frequent changes\r\nin these systems; by which shall be secured that constant employment to\r\nworkingmen and workingwomen throughout the country which will maintain\r\nthem upon an equality in all kinds and classes of industry; by which a\r\ncontinuous prosperity—which, if not so marked by rapid accumulation,\r\nshall possess the merit of permanency—will be secured to all, which in\r\ndue time will reduce the cost of all products to a minimum value; by\r\nwhich the laboring poor shall be relieved of the onerous tax, now\r\nindirectly imposed upon them by government; by which the burden of\r\ngovernmental support shall be placed where it properly belongs, and by\r\nwhich an unlimited national wealth will gradually accumulate, the ratio\r\nof taxation upon which will become so insignificant in amount as to be\r\nno burden to the people.\r\n\r\nA reform by which the power of legislative bodies to levy taxes shall be\r\nlimited to the actual necessities of the legitimate functions of\r\ngovernment in its protection of the rights of persons, property and\r\nnationality; and by which they shall be deprived of the power to exempt\r\nany property from taxation; or to make any distinctions directly or\r\nindirectly among citizens in taxation for the support of government; or\r\nto give or loan the public property or credit to individuals or\r\ncorporations to promote any enterprise whatever.\r\n\r\nA reform in the system of criminal jurisprudence, by which the death\r\npenalty shall no longer be inflicted—by which the hardened criminal\r\nshall have no human chance of being let loose to harass society until\r\nthe term of the sentence, whatever that may be, shall have expired, and\r\nby which, during that term, the entire prison employment shall be\r\nfor—and the product thereof be faithfully paid over to—the support of\r\nthe criminal’s family; and by which our so-called prisons shall be\r\nvirtually transformed into vast reformatory workshops, from which the\r\nunfortunate may emerge to be useful members of society, instead of the\r\nalienated citizens they now are.\r\n\r\nThe institution of such supervisory control and surveillance over the\r\nnow low orders of society as shall compel them to industry, and provide\r\nfor the helpless, and thus banish those institutions of pauperism and\r\nbeggary which are fastening upon the vitals of society, and are so\r\nprolific of crime and suffering in certain communities.\r\n\r\nThe organization of a general system of national education, which shall\r\npositively secure to every child of the country such an education in the\r\narts, sciences and general knowledge as will render them profitable and\r\nuseful members of society, and the entire proceeds of the public domain\r\nshould be religiously devoted to this end.\r\n\r\nSuch change in our general foreign policy as shall plainly indicate that\r\nwe realize and appreciate the important position which has been assigned\r\nus as a nation by the common order of civilization; which shall indicate\r\nour supreme faith in that form of government which emanates from, and is\r\nsupported by, the whole people, and that such government must eventually\r\nbe uniform throughout the world; which shall also have in view the\r\nestablishment of a Grand International Tribunal, to which all disputes\r\nof peoples and nations shall be referred for final arbitration and\r\nsettlement, without appeal to arms; said Tribunal maintaining only such\r\nan International army and navy as would be necessary to enforce its\r\ndecrees, and thus secure the return of the 15,000,000 of men who now\r\ncompose the standing armies of the world, to industrial and productive\r\npursuits.\r\n\r\nThus in the best sense do I claim to be the friend and exponent of the\r\nmost complete equality to which humanity can attain; of the broadest\r\nindividual freedom compatible with the public good, and that supreme\r\njustice which shall know no distinction among citizens upon any ground\r\nwhatever, in the administration and the execution of the laws; and also,\r\nto be a faithful worker in the cause of human advancement; and\r\nespecially to be the co-laborer with those who strive to better the\r\ncondition of the poor and friendless; to secure to the great mass of\r\nworking people the just reward of their toil,—I claim from these, and\r\nfrom all others in the social scale, that support in the bold political\r\ncourse I have taken, which shall give me the strength and the position\r\nto carry out these needed reforms, which shall secure to them, in\r\nreturn, the blessings which the Creator designed the human race should\r\nenjoy.\r\n\r\nIf I obtain this support, woman’s strength and woman’s will, with God’s\r\nsupport, if He vouchsafe it, shall open to them, and to this country, a\r\nnew career of greatness in the race of nations, which can only be\r\nsecured by that fearless course of truth from which the nations of the\r\nearth, under despotic male governments, have so far departed.\r\n\r\n                                                   VICTORIA C. WOODHULL.\r\n\r\n NEW YORK, JANUARY 10, 1871.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       TENDENCIES OF GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\n         [Revised from the New York Herald of April 16, 1870.]\r\n\r\n        VICTORIA C. WOODHULL ON THE “TENDENCIES OF GOVERNMENT.”\r\n\r\n\r\n GOD IN CREATION, IN HISTORY, AND IN GOVERNMENT—A PHILOSOPHICAL PREFACE\r\n                     TO A PHILOSOPHICAL DISCOURSE.\r\n\r\n[The head of the firm of Woodhull, Claflin & Co., Commodore Vanderbilt’s\r\nfinancial _proteges_—the famous brokers of Broad street—has undertaken\r\nthe difficult task of correcting popular errors in the science of\r\ngovernment, and has prepared a paper on the subject, which, as the lady\r\nexpects to be too busy to deliver for some time to come, we publish it\r\n_in extenso_. Whether her conclusions will agree with her premises or\r\nnot, the document will be found exceedingly interesting, as showing the\r\nquality of the female mind against which the money changers of Wall\r\nstreet will have to contend in business:]\r\n\r\nAs far back into the past as dim historic lights enable us to see, and\r\nstill much farther, even behind the appearance of man upon the face of\r\nthis planet, the existence of government can be plainly traced. Wherever\r\ntwo or more of any species of animals—not to descend lower and including\r\nman—are or have been, something simulating to what is in our day\r\ndenominated government exists or existed; and, whether it is or was over\r\na greater or less community, it is or was possessed of certain\r\ncharacterizing elements, from and by which a clear insight into the\r\ncomposition of the community can be obtained by those who will analyze\r\nthe elements somewhat philosophically; that is to say governments are\r\ntruthful reflections of the governed when considered as a whole, and all\r\nchanges or modifications that occur therein, result from growth of the\r\ngoverned.\r\n\r\nNo just nor advantageous deductions from any subject or fact which is\r\nworthy of a position in the world’s history, and which is capable of\r\npermanently maintaining such a position, can be arrived at, except\r\nthrough a complete philosophical analysis of all the elements entering\r\ninto its composition. All facts as well as all chemical compounds are\r\nmade up of elementary principles brought into intimate productive\r\nrelations by some general power, operating by some general law of\r\ncombination. By such an analysis the composition of such subjects and\r\nfacts as are analyzed are not only determined, but the relations which\r\nthey sustain to all other subjects and facts are also demonstrated, and\r\nthus a general law of relativity is found which makes the whole round of\r\ncreation one in purpose and effect.\r\n\r\nIt is not proposed in the present article to prosecute an exhaustive\r\nanalysis of government as it is or as it has been, but rather to observe\r\nthe chain of progression which has been evolved, and to endeavor to\r\ndetermine whether, link by link, it does not form one harmonious whole,\r\nfrom the present aspect of which its culmination may be caught sight of;\r\nand whether that culmination will not be found a complete circle,\r\ncontaining within its immense area all that has conspired and assisted\r\nin its completion, and which will be entitled to positions in such a\r\ncommunity of interests by virtue of having thus conspired and assisted\r\nin its formation.\r\n\r\nNeither is it proposed to extend the limits of this inquiry beyond the\r\nconsideration of human government, except in so far as analogies may be\r\nsought to enforce the application of general laws and to assist by such\r\napplication in the solution of such questions as may not be entirely\r\napparent from the evidences contained specifically within the said\r\nlimits. Philosophically considered, however, the objects sought could as\r\nwell be obtained from any other department of government; for, while a\r\ngeneral law underlies all forms and systems of human government and\r\ncontrols all its modifications, the self-same law underlies and controls\r\nall other forms and systems of government, from which human government\r\nsprung and upon which it rests as a primary basis.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that there is sufficient mental development and\r\ncomprehension contained in the philosophic minds of this latter part of\r\nthe nineteenth century to gather into form the evidence that has been\r\nand is being presented, in the evolution and dissolution of government,\r\nand grasp its signification, so that in its application to existing\r\nthings, permanent instead of politic modifications in governmental\r\naffairs may be inaugurated. Governed by any other than such a broad\r\nstandard, changes and modifications in present systems and forms are\r\nmade simply to meet the exigencies of the times, and with no view to\r\nplace government upon a basis which should never need modification, and\r\nwhich should meet all exigencies of all times. The reasons why such\r\ngovernment has not hitherto been inaugurated or attempted, are, because\r\nin no country has the general mind as yet become sufficiently broad and\r\ncomprehensive to discover that great general laws underlie the universe\r\nand govern all its manifestations, applying to each and every department\r\nthereof with perfect uniformity. It is not my province to discuss what\r\nthese great general laws and principles are. I assume that they do\r\nexist, and it is my office to predicate what the future of government\r\nmust be when it shall have its basis in such laws and principles, and to\r\njudge whether what has been, and what is, may be considered as gradual\r\napproaches from the most simple and homogeneous forms in which the\r\ninterest of all were very indefinite, either individually or\r\ncollectively, toward that wherein the interests of all, while becoming\r\nmore distinct individually, shall be merged in the general interests of\r\nthe whole and become identical therewith.\r\n\r\nMr. Maine says, in his “Ancient Law,” that “society in ancient times was\r\nnot what it is assumed to be at present—a collection of individuals. In\r\nfact, and in view of the men that composed it, it was an aggregation of\r\nfamilies. The contrast may be best and most forcibly expressed by saying\r\nthat the unit of an ancient society was the family; of a modern society,\r\nthe individual.”\r\n\r\nIn speaking of ancient society, Mr. Fiske says: “Family government\r\nexcluded not only individual independence but also State supremacy; and\r\nthat vestiges of a time when there were no aggregates of men more\r\nextensive than the family may be found in every part of the world, when\r\nsocial organization was but one step removed from absolute and ferocious\r\nanarchy;” and this he defines as a social aggregate of the first order;\r\nthe coalescence of families into civic communities an aggregate of the\r\nsecond order; the coalescence of civic and tribual communities into the\r\nnation an aggregate of the third order. The coalescence of nations would\r\nthen describe an aggregate of the fourth order. Under these four orders\r\nall the forms of government which can ever exist in the world must be\r\nclassified.\r\n\r\nAs low a form of government as can be conceived as existing next above\r\nthat of the family, worthy to be called human government, still exists\r\namong the barbarians inhabiting some portions of Central Africa, some of\r\nthe East India Islands, and perhaps some of the South Sea Islands. These\r\npeople unite in bands or tribes, and rove about seeking the means of\r\nsubsistence and endeavoring to conquer other tribes. Some have central\r\npoints of rendezvous, where the rudest habitations are constructed, in\r\nwhich the women and children remain during the absence of the men. The\r\nwomen almost universally are considered very much in the light of slaves\r\nby all these nomadic tribes, and as only fit to minister to their\r\npassions and to perform their drudgery. Their language is as rude as\r\ntheir habits, consisting of little more than a comparatively few\r\nspasmodically uttered harsh sounds. Written language they have none,\r\nexcepting perhaps some images or rude figures symbolizing some special\r\nevent they in this way attempt to commemorate, and which may be\r\nconsidered as the foundation of it for the tribes using them as they\r\nwere the primary foundation of all written language.\r\n\r\nOne notable feature is universally observable among all these\r\nrepresentatives of primitive government—they all recognize the necessity\r\nof a leader under some of the many forms of control exercised by the one\r\nover the many, and he is generally one who has exhibited some particular\r\nprowess in battle, the capacity to perform which he is supposed to be\r\nendowed with by some unknown power, and which renders him superior to\r\nall others, and best capable of ruling and protecting those who thus\r\nrecognize him, and who obey him in every particular, even to sacrificing\r\ntheir lives. Such may be considered an outline of our conceptions of the\r\nmost primitive form of government of the present day; and the fact that\r\nsuch still exists has a marked bearing upon the subject of general\r\ngovernment, when it is remembered that the time was when no higher form\r\nexisted on the face of the earth.\r\n\r\nThe law of evolution and that of dissolution being a universal deduction\r\nfrom the philosophic ultimatum _that force persists_, they apply to all\r\nthings wherein force is exhibited; consequently human government must be\r\nthe objective result of the persistence of force exhibited among the\r\npeople of the earth, and at the same time the subject of all\r\nmodifications that grow out of its transformations and equivalent\r\nrelations. In whatever light, then, human government is viewed, these\r\nphilosophic laws should never be lost sight of nor disregarded; but the\r\ncauses of all the rises and falls, transformations, modifications and\r\namalgamations, should be sought by the application of those laws to the\r\nobjective points under consideration.\r\n\r\nThe question now naturally arises, Can human government, then be\r\nanalyzed, and the facts it presents be found to correspond to the\r\ndeductions of philosophic law?\r\n\r\nIt has been remarked that the simplest combinations of force among human\r\nbeings, representing government which existed when none higher had been\r\nattained, was still represented on the earth by certain of its\r\ninhabitants. Beginning with this as the basis of the superstructure of\r\nhuman government, can there be traced a gradual scale of progress from\r\nit to the government of this country, in which scale each nation, tribe\r\nand tongue will find its appropriate place, which, unoccupied, would\r\nrender the scale imperfect, as a chain would be imperfect were one of\r\nits central links missing? and would an analysis of each of these\r\ngovernments develop the fact that each successive one in the progressive\r\nscale would represent some new application of the principle of liberty,\r\nsome more extended idea of equality, or some better formula of justice\r\nthan the preceding had, which application, idea or formula entitles it\r\nto rank superior thereto, and also determines its position in the scale?\r\n\r\nOf all systems and forms of government that came and passed away during\r\nthe long lapse of ages, from the time the most primitive alone existed\r\non the earth to the time wherein those flourished that have left records\r\nof their existence, we can know nothing except what may be gathered from\r\nphilosophic deduction unsupported by any actual record of facts\r\nconcerning them. It is, however, philosophically certain that very many\r\nsuch intermediate governments did exist, variously modified and\r\nadvancing from the primitive forms. Possessing, as we may justly infer,\r\nbut little capability for duration, their integration was rapidly\r\nsucceeded by disintegration; being exposed to numerous and different\r\nexternal influences, rapid and successive changes were inevitable,\r\nbecause they were possessed of but little individuality and consequently\r\nbut little capacity for resisting external influences. They were bound\r\ntogether by none of the higher laws of association, but were led by\r\ntransient ephemeral contingencies, combining at times together, to soon\r\ndivide and subdivide only to again form new and equally temporary\r\namalgamations. Thus constantly organizing and dissolving, the long\r\ninterval alluded to was occupied by primitive inhabitants in their march\r\nfrom the purely homogeneous toward the individualized times wherein\r\ncivilization left records of itself.\r\n\r\nWhile no special inquiries into the correctness of the formulas laid\r\ndown at various times by various philosophers, which seek to include and\r\ncover all the phenomena of the universe, will be made, those of the most\r\neminent may with propriety be stated; indeed, if it be attempted to show\r\nthat history obeys a fixed law of evolution, the law that it is presumed\r\nto obey must be given, that it may be seen whether the deductions\r\narrived at are included within the limits of the formula. If it should\r\nnot so turn out, then either the deduction must be illegitimate, the\r\nformula imperfect or impossible, or the fact made apparent, that, while\r\nall the other sciences, as biology, psychology and their various\r\ndivisions, are known to conform to certain well determined laws of\r\ncausation, sociology, in which all history and government find their\r\nbasis, conforms to no law, but is the product of the merest chance.\r\n\r\nUntil within the present century it was not claimed by any of the\r\nvarious philosophers who had flourished that there was such a science as\r\nsociology; or, if so claimed by any far-seeing mind, the attempt to\r\ndemonstrate or formulate it was not made until the time of Comte, who,\r\nabout the year 1830, did attempt it, and he may be justly styled the\r\nfather of the present system of formulated science. Though his system is\r\nnow shown to contain many imperfections and omissions, it is\r\nnevertheless certain, that but for it, the improvements since made would\r\nnot have been possible to the present degree attained, though those who\r\nhave made them may repudiate the idea, and scorn to acknowledge that\r\nthey have built upon Comte.\r\n\r\nGathering from his profuse writings upon this point his earlier and most\r\ncontinuous opinions, the following are the terms in which they can be\r\nthe most simply expressed: Social progression is a gradual change from\r\nrudimentary, homogeneous and anthropomorphic conditions to civilization,\r\nheterogeneity and to definite conceptions of the external world; and at\r\nthe same time from nomadic characteristics, with aggressive purposes, to\r\ninhabitative propensities and individual industrial pursuits.\r\n\r\nA number of philosophers, who have written since the days of Comte, have\r\nfrom time to time presented formulas which at best can only be\r\nconsidered as modifications of his, and it may confidently be asserted\r\nthat no real addition was acquired until the Spencerian was made, which,\r\nwhile it included Comte’s, was more general and comprehensive, and at\r\nthe same time more definite and special. This seeming anomaly was made\r\npossible by his having discovered the law of evolution, and by having\r\nexhaustively demonstrated that all mental action—emotional as well as\r\nintellectual—was included in it. It is as follows: Evolution is an\r\nintegration of matter and a concomitant dissipation of motion, during\r\nwhich the matter passes from an indefinite, incoherent homogeneity to a\r\ndefinite, coherent heterogeneity, and during which the retained motion\r\nundergoes a partial transformation. This general formula includes all\r\nevolution, organic and inorganic, and interprets not only the genesis of\r\nthe sidereal and solar systems and of the earth, but also of life upon\r\nthe earth, and has become the law of all social, moral and intellectual\r\nchange. He afterward found it necessary to make a supplement especially\r\napplicable to organic life, in such terms as should not include the\r\ninorganic. It was as follows: “Life—and intelligence being the highest\r\nmanifestations of life—consists in the continuous establishment of\r\nrelations within the organism, in correspondence with relations existing\r\nwithin the environment or the surroundings.”\r\n\r\nTo this exhaustive statement a late generalization and specialization\r\nhas been made by Mr. Fiske, especially applicable to social evolution,\r\nas follows: The progress of society is a continuous establishment of\r\npsychical relations within the community, in conformity to physical and\r\npsychical relations arising within the environment, during which, both\r\nthe community and the environment pass from a state of incoherent\r\nhomogeneity to a state of coherent heterogeneity, and during which the\r\nconstitutional units of the community become ever more distinctly\r\nindividuated.\r\n\r\nHaving now arrived at that point where history must furnish the facts\r\nupon which the subject rests, it may be well to comprehensively\r\nrecapitulate a perhaps somewhat too long introduction. It was seen that\r\nall over the face of the earth where human life was represented,\r\ngovernment exists, and that this government was representative of one or\r\nanother of the three orders of aggregates of individuals—the family, the\r\ntribal, or the nations, and that an aggregate of nations would add the\r\nfourth order. It was also seen that the evolution of government was the\r\nobjective result of the persistence of force among its component parts.\r\nFixing the basis of government in this philosophic fact, it was\r\nnecessary to examine the history of government to see if in its\r\nevolution it had conformed to this law, according to present accepted\r\nformulas; and if so found to have done, to extend the same into the\r\nfuture, to ascertain if possible what the future would be. Thus by a\r\npresent understanding of the law and its tendencies, all modifications\r\nand changes made in present systems and forms might be so made in\r\nharmony therewith, and not with a simple view to meet the present\r\nexigencies, but with an understanding that would meet all exigencies of\r\nall time, which alone is perfect legislation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     THE TENDENCIES OF GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\n         [Revised from the New York Herald of April 25, 1870.]\r\n\r\n\r\n SECOND PART OF MRS. VICTORIA C. WOODHULL’S PHILIPPIC—LAWS, PEOPLES AND\r\nCOMMUNITIES FROM A FEMALE POINT OF VIEW—LESSONS IN HISTORY, POLITICS AND\r\n                                  WAR.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Mrs. Victoria C. Woodhull, head of the firm of female brokers in Broad\r\nstreet, presents to the readers of the _Herald_ the following\r\ncommunication, the second part of her paper on “The Tendencies of\r\nGovernment,” the preface to which has already appeared. Mrs. Woodhull\r\nhas undertaken the difficult task of enlightening the public mind on the\r\nbest means of running the Government machine of America. Though her\r\nviews, expressed in this paper, have a wide range, it must be said that\r\nshe is but putting herself in wind for a tremendous attack on “the best\r\nGovernment the world ever saw.” Being already in the race for the\r\nPresidency (not of the Sorosis, but of the United States), her\r\npronunciamentos are of course very important:]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt must begin to be apparent that the proposition is, that the evolution\r\nof government does not differ from that of simplest organic forms either\r\nin principle or in mode of operation. The same laws that govern the\r\ngrowth and multiply the plant also govern society and multiply it. The\r\nsame laws that bring fruit to perfection and dissolution perfect and\r\ndissolve societies. The same laws that produce and control the units of\r\nthe animal kingdom produce and control the units of society. The same\r\nlaw that governs the ebbing and flowing of the tides, that determines\r\nwhether the component parts of water shall exist as water or vapor,\r\ndetermines the movements of society and the conditions of its existence;\r\nand the same law that produces an earthquake here, a volcanic eruption\r\nthere or a terrific hurricane elsewhere, produces the earthquakes,\r\nvolcanic eruptions and the hurricanes that are ever modifying and\r\nchanging society. Symbols of all the various processes society passes\r\nthrough in its growth and extension can be found in every other\r\ndepartment of the universe; or, to assert the same fact differently,\r\neverywhere in the universe there is a constant effort to attain an\r\nequilibrium—a continuous working to supply wants, an unceasing process\r\nof demand and supply, which are universal exemplifications of the law\r\nthat motion is always in the direction of the least resistance or the\r\ngreatest traction, or the resultant of the two operating conjointly.\r\n\r\nBut what does history tell of the foundation and dissolution of\r\ngovernments, and what illustrations of the law of progress does it\r\nafford? As before stated, those who have most earnestly studied\r\npre-historic time have found ample evidence that the time was when the\r\nhead of the family was the highest sovereign power, and so absolute in\r\nits character that the individual was entirely submerged in it, and\r\nState supremacy was an impossibility. Nothing but anarchy and confusion\r\ncould have attended such rule; constant rivalry, jealousy and contention\r\nmust have kept up a continual strife between adjacent families, which\r\ncould know no settlement except through the subjugation or destruction\r\nof the weaker of the contending parties. Of this order of governmental\r\naggregations, it is questionable if the earth at present furnishes any\r\nillustrations, unless it be in some part thereof to which the discoverer\r\nhas not yet penetrated. Of the next, or tribal, order of aggregates, it\r\ndoes, however; and with this second order the real analysis and\r\ncomparison must begin, though we have no objective means of\r\ndemonstrating the conditions stated as existing. When family sovereignty\r\nwas universal it can readily be seen that the continued existence of\r\nsuch conditions would be impossible, for the continuous subjugations and\r\namalgamations of families would lead directly to tribal communities, at\r\nfirst in absolute subjection to one tribe, which would grow into some\r\npower, distributed among the several tribes. So also would the joining\r\ntogether of several weak families to resist a more powerful neighbor\r\nlead directly to confederation.\r\n\r\nThe subjugation and reduction of families to bondage and slavery was the\r\nbeginning of that system of interdependence now so broadly extended into\r\ncommerce, exchange and mutual dependence for almost the necessities of\r\nlife. In the times referred to every man was his own farmer, tailor,\r\ncarpenter and cook, and this condition was only modified when the\r\nindividuals of conquering families began to rely upon the conquered for\r\ncertain services they otherwise would have been obliged to render\r\nthemselves. All of these facts exemplify another philosophic\r\nproposition—that for anything in the universe to remain in its\r\nhomogeneous condition is impossible, which impossibility is the result\r\nof the fact that motion must produce change, while constant motion is\r\ninevitable so long as force persists and matter resists.\r\n\r\nThat eminent historian of the third decade of the eighteenth century,\r\nRollin, thus remarks of the earliest monuments which are preserved,\r\ntreating of the progress from simple to complex forms of government:—“To\r\nknow in what manner the states and kingdoms were founded that have\r\ndivided the universe, the steps whereby they rose to that pitch of\r\ngrandeur related in history, by what ties families and cities united in\r\norder to constitute one body of society, and to live together under the\r\nsame laws and common authority, it will be necessary to trace things\r\nback in a manner to the infancy of the world and to those ages in which\r\nmankind, being dispersed into different regions, began to people the\r\nearth.” In these early ages every father was the supreme head of his\r\nfamily; the arbiter and judge of whatever contests and divisions might\r\narise within it; the natural legislator over his little society, the\r\ndefender and protector of those who, by their birth, education and\r\nweakness, were under his protection and safeguard. The laws which the\r\npaternal vigilance established in this domestic senate being dictated\r\nwith no other view than to promote the general welfare, were concerted\r\nwith such children as were come to years of maturity and accepted by the\r\ninferiors with a full and free consent, were religiously kept and\r\npreserved in families as an hereditary polity, to which they owed their\r\npeace and security.\r\n\r\nBut different motives gave rise to different laws. One man, overjoyed at\r\nthe birth of a first born son, resolved to distinguish him from future\r\nchildren by bestowing on him a more considerable share of his\r\npossessions, and giving him greater authority in his family. Another,\r\nmore attentive to the interests of a beloved wife or darling daughter,\r\nwhom he wanted to settle in the world, thought it incumbent on him to\r\nsecure her rights and increase her advantages. The solitary and\r\ncheerless state a wife might be reduced to in case she should become a\r\nwidow affected more intimately another man, and made him provide\r\nbeforehand for the subsistence and comfort of a woman who formed his\r\nfelicity. In proportion as every family increased by the birth of\r\nchildren and their marrying into other families, they extended their\r\ndomain, and by insensible degrees formed towns and cities. From these\r\ndifferent views and others of a like nature arose the different customs\r\nand rights of nations.\r\n\r\nThese societies growing in time very numerous, and the families,\r\ndividing into different branches, each having its head, it was necessary\r\nto intrust one person with the whole in order to unite all these heads\r\nunder one authority and to maintain the public good by a uniform\r\nadministration. To heighten the lustre of this newly acquired dignity\r\nand to cause them to devote themselves entirely to the public good, the\r\ntitle of king was bestowed upon them and they were invested with full\r\npower to administer justice and to punish crime.\r\n\r\nAt first every city had its particular king, who, being more solicitous\r\nof preserving his dominion than of enlarging it, confined his ambition\r\nwithin its limits But the unavoidable feuds that break out between\r\nneighbors, the jealousy against a more powerful rival, the turbulent\r\nspirit of a prince, his martial disposition or thirst for aggrandizing\r\nhimself and displaying his ability, gave rise to wars which frequently\r\nended in the entire subjugation of the vanquished and the addition of\r\ntheir cities to the victors. Thus a first victory led the way to a\r\nsecond, which, making a prince more powerful and enterprising, several\r\ncities and provinces became united under one monarch, forming kingdoms\r\nof greater or less extent, according to the degree the victor pushed his\r\nconquests. Such was the origin of the famous empires that at times\r\nincluded the greater part of the known world.\r\n\r\nFrom various historical authorities the following summaries of history\r\nare obtained, and are presented as containing some of the principal\r\npoints by which the general progress of the world should be judged. The\r\nprincipal empires of ancient time will be observed separately; those of\r\nmodern time under one head, because of the more connected character of\r\ntheir histories, and because of the more general knowledge that is\r\npossessed of them. Then the general course events took will be noticed,\r\nthe deductions that legitimately flow from them introduced, and the\r\nbearing they have upon present affairs of the world in reference to its\r\nfuture condition of government considered.\r\n\r\nThere are several nations that have, at various times, and that still do\r\nclaim, the greatest antiquity. The Chinese, the Indians, the Syrians and\r\nEgyptians appear to have the most evidence to support their claim. The\r\nEgyptians once accorded it to the Phrygians, through the result of the\r\nsomewhat singular experiment of confining two children away from all\r\nintercourse with the world until they began to cry, “_Beecos_,” which\r\nwas found to be the Phrygian word for bread. This word, Psammetichus,\r\nthe King decided must be of the original language, and consequently that\r\nthe Phrygians were the original people.\r\n\r\nManetho, a high priest in Egypt, who had charge of the sacred archives,\r\npretends to have extracted from the writings of Mercurius and to have\r\nproved thereby that up to the time of Alexander the Great, whose reign\r\nbegan 356 years B. C., there had been thirty dynasties in Egypt, which\r\ntogether covered a space of more than 5,300 years. If this claim be\r\nallowed, Egypt has existed 7,500 years. Herodotus says “that the\r\nEgyptian priests computed 341 generations until the reign of Sethon,”\r\nwhich began 719 years B. C. “These generations,” he adds, “make 11,341\r\nyears.” They also counted a like number of priests and kings, who had\r\nsucceeded one another without interruption, under the name of “Pyromas,”\r\nsignifying good and virtuous. These priests hewed 341 colossal statues\r\nin wood of these Pyromas, all arranged in a large hall in the order of\r\ntheir succession.\r\n\r\nLet these claims be false or true, historians unanimously agree that\r\nMenes was the first King of Egypt, and that his reign began 2,188 years\r\nB. C., which would make its historic age about 5,000 years; undoubtedly\r\nits fabulous age would cover a sufficient period to make what is\r\nclaimed, at least by Menetho, if not by the priests Herodotus mentions.\r\nThese claims will seem the more probable when we are informed that a few\r\nages only after Menes, the first King, one Busiris, built the famous\r\ncity of Thebes, and made it the seat of his empire, which would seem to\r\nindicate that the arts and sciences had at that time been carried to a\r\nconsiderable degree of perfection, not only in the building of cities,\r\nbut also in their adornment; for we are told that the public buildings\r\nwere decorated with sculptures and paintings of the most exquisite\r\nbeauty.\r\n\r\nAdditional force is also given these claims by the fact that Osymandyas,\r\nthe successor of this Busiris, collected a magnificent library at\r\nThebes, called “The Treasury of Remedies for Diseases of the Soul,”\r\nwhich would indicate that polite learning had made considerable\r\nadvancement as well in philosophy as in religion. Historians also inform\r\nus that Cham, the father of Misriam—the same with Menes—was the second\r\nson of Noah, and it is supposed that he retired into Africa after the\r\n“confusion of tongues.” He was doubtless the Jupiter Ammont so long\r\nworshiped as a god by the Egyptians. We are also informed that this\r\nCham, or Ham, had three other sons—Chus, who settled Ethiopia; Phut, who\r\nsettled Africa westward from Egypt, and Canaan in the country that\r\nafterward was called after him, and whose descendants were called\r\nPhœnicians.\r\n\r\nWhen we remember the so-called flood; that Cham was the second son of\r\nNoah and the father of Menes, the first king, 2,189 years B. C., and\r\nthat 200 years later Osymandyas, one of his successors, was able to fit\r\nout an expedition against the Bactrians of Asia, consisting of 400,000\r\nfoot and 20,000 horse, it must be conceded that if the “flood” destroyed\r\nall the people existing on the face of the earth, except those saved in\r\nthe ark, the descendants of Cham must have multiplied with inconceivable\r\nrapidity to have made the collecting of such an army possible. But this\r\nis not more astonishing than the supposition would be that there could\r\nbe contained in the atmosphere surrounding the earth sufficient moisture\r\nto form the amount of water, which, falling through a space of forty\r\ndays and nights, should cover the whole earth to the depth narrated of\r\nNoah’s flood; nor more so than that the temperature of the whole earth\r\nat that time should have been so uniform as to have permitted rain\r\nthroughout, instead of hail or snow, in frigid portions thereof. And if\r\nwe were to inquire where such a quantity of water was borrowed from and\r\nreturned, a consistent reply would be equally surprising; for it is now\r\nknown that there is just as large a quantity of the elements that\r\ncompose water at present as there was then.\r\n\r\nConsiderable latitude can be allowed the statements regarding the flood,\r\nwhen it is remembered that the knowledge of geography, astronomy and\r\nmeteorology must have been exceedingly limited at that time. But if\r\ncredence is given to it as having occurred—and it is conceded that all\r\nthe people Noah knew were destroyed by it—and a solution is sought, it\r\ncan be imagined that a tremendous upheaval of mountains in Northern Asia\r\nmight have thrown the waters of the Arctic Ocean southward over the\r\ncountry Noah dwelt in; but this could not have been the result of forty\r\ndays and forty nights rain, though it may have rained continuously\r\nduring that period, and may have been considered such by Noah.\r\n\r\nThis digression was not made so much to consider the probabilities of a\r\nflood having occurred as to give additional force to the historic fact\r\nthat but a few generations after it is said to have occurred, immense\r\ntribes of people did exist in that portion of the world bordering on the\r\neastern Mediterranean Sea, who were possessed of considerable general\r\nknowledge, immense wealth, and, for that age, good ideas of governmental\r\njustice; besides these people, it must also be remembered vast hosts of\r\nbarbarians existed in the more remote parts of Europe, Asia and Africa,\r\nof whose origin and condition nothing can be positively known, either of\r\nwhich bodies of people could not have descended from Noah’s family\r\nthrough the common course of reproduction.\r\n\r\nWhat concerns this inquiry most, is not whether all or any of the\r\nnarratives of ancient writers are entitled to credence, but how and in\r\nwhat directions the ancient tribal nations extended themselves and\r\nbecame merged one with another. Following the history of Egypt from the\r\ntime of Menes through the reigns of his successors—Busiris, Osymandyas\r\n(whose mausoleum displayed such extravagant magnificence), and\r\nEuchoreus, who built the famous Memphis and made it the key to the\r\nNile—on through the space of two hundred and sixty years of the Shepherd\r\nKings, from Phœnicia to Amosis, who expelled them, and reunited the\r\ncountry, and to Sesostris, the most powerful king and the greatest\r\nconqueror the world had then known, but little evidence of increasing\r\nproficiency in science and art is found, but much that the acquired\r\nstandard was continually being extended among the people and among\r\nsurrounding nations.\r\n\r\nWith the reign of Sesostris a new era was inaugurated, and a mighty\r\nimpetus to general civilization, as well as to special advancement, was\r\ngiven by his wisdom and foresight. Amenophis, the father of Sesostris,\r\nno doubt feeling the weight of impending events, foresaw the necessity\r\nof preparing him to meet them. He not only took great care that his\r\neducation in the arts and sciences, the principles of government,\r\nphilosophy and the art of war, should be complete, but also caused all\r\nmale children of Egypt born the same day he was, to be educated with\r\nhim, with the distinct understanding that they were to be his future\r\ncomrades, his officers, ministers and friends in the aggressive wars he\r\nintended he should engage in when he should ascend the throne. It is\r\nsaid that the celebrated Mercurius had charge over them all, especially\r\nin politics, war and government.\r\n\r\nThe first war Sesostris engaged in was against the Arabs, which his\r\nfather sent him upon while yet quite young, that he might acquire\r\npractical knowledge in conducting military campaigns. This people, who\r\nhad never before been subdued, he conquered, and added their country to\r\nEgypt The next year he invaded Lybia, a country to the southwest of\r\nEgypt. During this expedition his father died, leaving the throne to\r\nhim. He immediately formed a no less design than of conquering the whole\r\nworld. This was in 1491 B. C., and he was probably the first of the\r\ngreat conquerors of ancient times who conceived the idea of reducing the\r\nworld to a single form of government, and most assuredly the first\r\npossessed of sufficient wisdom to carry out so gigantic an undertaking.\r\nThe manner he set about to do this, and the capacity he evinced in all\r\nthe preparations, we shall have occasion to compare hereafter with that\r\npursued and shown by others in after time, simply remarking here that it\r\nis safe to conclude that Sesostris was great among the greatest; for, to\r\nboundless ambition—possessed by many—he united the capacity to sustain\r\nit, which few can boast. While making the most extensive preparations\r\nfor raising and disciplining armies for foreign operations, he was not\r\nless active in providing for sustaining the dignity and power of his\r\nGovernment during his absence, which he foresaw would give opportunity\r\nfor rivals to attempt to overthrow for their own benefit. His first army\r\nconsisted of 600,000 foot, 24,000 horse, and 27,000 armed chariots, and\r\nits principal officers were the 1,700 youths who had been educated with\r\nhim, and who now made it possible for him to secure perfect discipline\r\nand the greatest efficiency.\r\n\r\nWith this army he first invaded and conquered Ethiopia, and made it\r\ntributary to Egypt. He next fitted out an expedition of 400 sail, and\r\nmade himself master of all the islands and coasts of the Red Sea, as a\r\npreparatory step to the conquest of Asia, then advanced into Asia,\r\nsubduing all the countries, even “beyond the Ganges.” Returning\r\nwestward, he conquered Scythia, Armenia, Cappadocia, Colchis, and all\r\nAsia Minor: then crossed into Europe, and would probably have subdued\r\nall its nations had he not encountered a great scarcity of provisions in\r\nThrace, which caused him to return. Herodotus says that the Egyptian\r\nEmpire extended from the Danube even beyond the Ganges, and included all\r\nof Africa, and that all over this vast territory there were erected\r\npillars, on which was inscribed “Sesostris, king of kings and lord of\r\nlords, subdued this country by the power of his arms;” which, while it\r\ndisplayed a commendable spirit in marking the limits of his conquest, it\r\nat the same time evinces a growing personal vanity that afterward\r\nseriously tarnished his early fame.\r\n\r\nAfter having thus conquered the then entire known world, Sesostris\r\nreturned to Egypt with innumerable captives and laden with spoils, and,\r\nby devoting himself to enriching and benefiting Egypt, rather than to\r\nextending his dominions, fame and grandeur, showed that his ambition had\r\nexpended itself in his first great campaign. From all that can be\r\ngathered of his reign over Egypt, it must be inferred that no country\r\nbefore, if since, was ever more happily disposed toward its sovereign.\r\nThe many monuments of his greatness, throughout his dominions, were\r\ncovered with inscriptions, asserting that all Sesostris’ mighty deeds\r\nwere accomplished without burdening his subjects; but, on the contrary,\r\nthey all had become able, through them, to pass the remainder of their\r\ndays in “calm and repose.”\r\n\r\nHaving subdued so much of the world, had he been equally ambitious to\r\nextend over it the same beneficent Government that he held over\r\nEgypt—which he could easily have done through the numerous competent\r\npersons the foresight of Amenophis had provided him with, who were well\r\nversed in his policy and administration of affairs—Sesostris would\r\nundoubtedly have earned and been entitled to the appellation of the\r\nworld’s benefactor. It appears, however, that he did not exert himself\r\nat all in this direction, but was content to receive the annual tributes\r\nhe levied to enrich Egypt proper. His reasons for pursuing this course,\r\nrather than of endeavoring to reward his most worthy adherents by making\r\nthem rulers of the countries they had assisted him to conquer, are\r\nincomprehensible, and that they should not have urged him to it equally\r\nso. When it is considered how wisely and happily he governed Egypt, it\r\ncan be imagined how vastly he might have benefited the conquered people\r\nby diffusing correct knowledge of the art of government among them\r\nthrough extending his rule over them.\r\n\r\nAs it was, it came about, that various Egyptian colonies scattered here\r\nand there over the conquered country, and in this way were instrumental\r\nin spreading the wisdom of their nation. It was one of these colonies\r\nthat afterward became the famous Athens—the seat of learning, literature\r\nand philosophy. It was about this time also that the use of letters was\r\nintroduced by one Cadmus, whom the Egyptians claimed to be of their\r\ncountry; but the majority of writers agree that they originated in\r\nSyria, and that they were identical with the Hebraic. Of these, however,\r\nthere were but sixteen, four others being added some two hundred and\r\nfifty years later, and the remaining four a long time afterward.\r\n\r\nThe reign of Sesostris may justly be considered as having produced more\r\ngeneral and extended influence upon the world than that of any of his\r\nancestors of any country, and that nothing occurred that can hold any\r\ndegree of comparison to it until the time of Alexander, more than a\r\nthousand years afterward. Sesostris was succeeded by Pheron, and he by\r\nProteus, who dedicated the beautiful temple to “Venus the Stranger,”\r\nsupposed to be “Helen of Troy,” famous for her beauty, and who was\r\nstolen by Paris, from whom she was taken by Proteus and returned to the\r\nGreeks.\r\n\r\nUnder succeeding reigns, the glory of Egypt began to decline, violence\r\nand cruelty to usurp the places where justice and moderation had so long\r\nprevailed, and jealousies, petty malice and personal aggrandizement to\r\ntake the place of that love of country which is superior to self; nor\r\ncould aught else have been expected from the ill-advised luxury and ease\r\nthe country obtained under Sesostris, which should have been converted\r\ninto action and expended upon tributary nations. The downward tendency,\r\nor the disintegrating process, having begun, demonstrated that the\r\nprinciple upon which Egypt rose and flourished had culminated, and was\r\nnow to be disseminated among other nations and tribes. Nor could any\r\neffort of succeeding rulers, who saw the process at work and understood\r\nthe causes thereof, stop the downward tendency, which continued with but\r\ntemporary interruptions until the death of Tharaca, 687 years B. C.,\r\nwhen the kingdom remained in a state of anarchy, until twelve noblemen\r\nconspired to divide it among themselves. For some superstitious reasons\r\nPsammetichus, one of the twelve, was banished; but he, entering into a\r\nleague with some Greeks, made war upon the eleven, defeated them, and\r\nagain united the kingdom under one rule, and remained sole possessor of\r\nit until his death.\r\n\r\nSix hundred and sixteen years B. C. one Nechos arose, who attempted the\r\ncutting of a canal from the Nile to the Red Sea, but was unsuccessful.\r\nThis, however, was partly atoned for by the accomplishment of a voyage\r\nentirely around the coast of Africa by some skilful Phœnician sailors he\r\nemployed, they leaving Egypt by the Red Sea and returning by the way of\r\nthe Mediterranean after an absence of three years. This passage was made\r\nsome 2,000 years before the Portuguese discovered this way to the\r\nIndies, by which these Phœnicians were able to enter the Mediterranean\r\nthrough the Straits of Gibraltar.\r\n\r\nTrouble after trouble now distracted the kingdom, and its power and\r\ninfluence declined with every reign, until the Persians, under Cambyses,\r\n525 years B. C., subdued it. Since the downfall of the Persian Empire,\r\nEgypt has successively been subject to the Macedonians, Romans,\r\nSaracens, Mamelukes, and lastly the Turks, by whom it is now nominally\r\npossessed. The late accomplishment of the project Nechos failed in may\r\nbe prophetic of radical changes in the condition Egypt has so long been\r\nsubmerged in—the indications being favorable for a return to\r\nconsiderable importance among the nations of the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     THE TENDENCIES OF GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\n          [Revised from the New York Herald of May 2d, 1870.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                     MRS. WOODHULL’S THIRD LETTER.\r\n\r\nNearly all historians who have written since Josephus have endeavored to\r\nreconcile sacred and profane history. This task Rollin attempts\r\nregarding the origin of the Assyrian empire. Diodorus says that “Ninus,\r\nthe most ancient Assyrian king, performed great actions. Being naturally\r\nof a warlike disposition, and ambitious of glory which results from\r\nvalor, he armed a considerable number of young men that were brave and\r\nvigorous, like himself, and trained them to all manner of hardships.”\r\nThis Ninus, Rollin endeavors to make it appear, was the Nimrod of the\r\nScriptures, and the Belus who was afterward worshiped as a god.\r\nCalisthenes, a philosopher, who was one of the retinue of Alexander the\r\nGreat, says the Babylonians reckoned their origin back some 115 years\r\nafter the Deluge, which would be about 2,250 years B. C. The conflict of\r\nauthority upon the origin of this empire, renders it competent for our\r\npurpose to assume this date, and that Nimrod was the first historic king\r\nof Assyria.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAssyria is supposed to have derived its name from Asshur, the son of\r\nShem, who, the Scripture says, settled this country. Nimrod possessed\r\nhimself of the province, introduced his own subjects into it, built\r\ncities and made himself generally beloved. It is said he built Nineveh,\r\nmore grand and magnificent than all the rest, and named it after his son\r\nNinus, who, on his accession to the throne, conceived the design of\r\nextending his conquests, and began to prepare troops and officers\r\ncapable of carrying it out. In seventeen years he conquered all the\r\ncountry between Egypt, India and Bactriana, which last country he did\r\nnot think himself strong enough to attack with success.\r\n\r\nWhile preparing for further and greater conquests he also determined to\r\nimmortalize his name by making of Nineveh a city at once commensurate\r\nwith his power and wealth. His design, says Diodorus, was “to make it\r\nthe largest and noblest city in the world, and to put it beyond the\r\npower of others who might come after him to ever build another such.\r\nNor,” as Rollin adds, “was he deceived in this; for never did any city\r\ncome up to the greatness and magnificence of this.” It was eighteen\r\nmiles and three-quarters long and eleven miles and one-quarter broad,\r\nand was surrounded by a wall one hundred feet high.\r\n\r\nHaving completed Nineveh he pursued his intended campaign against the\r\nBactrians, into whose country he marched an army of 1,700,000 foot,\r\n200,000 horse and 20,000 chariots, armed with scythes. With this vast\r\narray he quickly overran the whole country and finally laid siege to its\r\ncapital. This city was strongly fortified and stoutly defended, so much\r\nso that Ninus began to despair of reducing it, when the wife of one of\r\nhis officers advised him how to attack its citadels so as to capture\r\nthem, and by them the city. This woman was the afterward celebrated\r\nSemiramis. Ninus made use of her advice, and the city fell into his\r\nhands with but little loss to him.\r\n\r\nNinus, finding a woman possessed of such remarkable capacity to aid him\r\nin his ambitious designs, at once conceived for Semiramis the most\r\nviolent passion. Her husband, upon hearing this, killed himself to\r\nescape the fury of Ninus. Having married her, he not long after\r\ndied—some assert by her connivance—and left the kingdom to her.\r\n\r\nIt was Semiramis who undertook the building of the mighty Babylon, in\r\nwhich work she employed two million men. Dr. Prideaux tells us the walls\r\naround Babylon were three hundred and fifty feet high and eighty feet\r\nthick, and that it contained six hundred and seventy-six squares two\r\nmiles and a quarter in circumference. His description of the walls, the\r\nquays and bridges, lakes, ditches, canals, palaces, hanging-gardens and\r\ntemple of Belus presents a picture of grandeur and magnificence unknown\r\nin this age. Diodorus also says even in his time there were many\r\nmonuments of grandeur still standing bearing the name of Semiramis.\r\n\r\nThis beautiful and extraordinary woman possessed the most marvelous\r\ncontrol over all she came in contact with. Her simple presence was\r\nsufficient to quell any tumult or mutinous proceeding. Not satisfied\r\nwith the immense possessions left her by Ninus, she conquered Ethiopia\r\nand the larger part of Africa. Not yet content, she determined upon the\r\nsubjugation of India, against which she set out with 3,000,000 foot,\r\n500,000 horse and a multitude of camels, with which she thought to make\r\nhead against the Indian elephants. After she had successfully crossed\r\nthe river Indus the Indian King fell upon her army, with his elephants,\r\nwith such fury that it was utterly routed. Semiramis was by this defeat\r\ncompelled to give over the conquest of India. Having reigned forty-two\r\nyears she resigned the throne to Ninyas, her son, whom she discovered\r\nwas plotting against her life, as the Jupiter Ammon of Egypt had told\r\nher years before he would. She retired from the sight of men, hoping\r\nspeedily to have divine honors granted her name, which was also\r\nprophesied for her by the Egyptian god.\r\n\r\nOf these vast armies, which predicate still more vast population, Rollin\r\nremarks: “I must own I am somewhat puzzled with a difficulty which may\r\nbe raised against the extraordinary things related of Ninus and\r\nSemiramis, as they do not seem to agree with the times so near the\r\ndeluge; I mean such vast armies; such a numerous cavalry; so many\r\nchariots armed with scythes; such immense treasures of silver and gold,\r\nand the magnificence of the buildings. The temple of Belus alone\r\ncontained more than twenty millions pounds sterling hoarded treasure.”\r\nRollin argues that the Greek historians, from whom he compiled, must\r\nhave fallen into some grave errors, since, that such things should have\r\noccurred so soon after the deluge, presupposes what must have been\r\nbeyond the range of possibility.\r\n\r\nThe Assyrian empire, having attained the zenith of power and\r\nmagnificence under Semiramis, began to sink into a gradual decay, the\r\nkings themselves setting the example of indolence and dissipation. This\r\nprocess of decay continued until the time of Sardanapalus, about 700\r\nyears B. C. He surpassed all his predecessors in effeminacy, cowardice\r\nand licentious luxury, and abandoned himself completely to pleasure,\r\nwine and women; even dressing and painting his cheeks as the women did.\r\nIt seems strange that a people so used to glory and conquest should not\r\nhave sooner revolted against such debauchery and dissoluteness. This was\r\nleft for one Arbaces to do; he obtained entrance to the King’s palace,\r\nand with his own eyes witnessed the truth of the reports about the King.\r\nArbaces at once began to incite rebellion; by his reports he gained over\r\nthe governors of several provinces, who raised an army and marched\r\nagainst the King, whom they succeeded in shutting up in the city of\r\nNineveh. The King considered Nineveh impregnable, but the river Tigris\r\nsuddenly rose to a great height and broke down some portions of the\r\nwalls of the city, which admitted the troops of the rebellious\r\ngovernors. Sardanapalus then proceeded to burn himself, his women and\r\ntreasure, which latter, according to Atheneus, amounted to “a thousand\r\nmyriads of talents of gold and ten times as much silver, each myriad of\r\nwhich was of the value of $7,000,000.” Such treasure we in this age know\r\nnothing of. After the death of Sardanapalus the empire was dismembered,\r\nand the kingdoms of Babylon, Nineveh and Medea formed from its ruins.\r\nBetween these there was constant warfare waged. During the time of\r\nCyazares a horde of Scythian barbarians devastated the three kingdoms,\r\nremaining their masters until the people disposed of them by a general\r\nstratagem—slaughtering them while drunk with wine, at feasts to which,\r\nby concert, each family of Assyrians had invited them upon an agreed\r\nday. Such as escaped this, fled the country. Cyazares, after repeated\r\nefforts, succeeded in utterly destroying Nineveh, the last city that\r\nheld out against him, and with the aid of his nephew, Cyrus, united the\r\nthree kingdoms again under one government, which was the beginning of\r\nthe famous empire of the Medes and Persians.\r\n\r\nCrœsus, King of Lydia, is here entitled to a slight digressive reference\r\non account of the influence he at this time exercised. Vast riches in\r\nmost kingdoms had led to indolence, effeminacy and licentiousness; but\r\nCrœsus thought it unworthy for any person, much less a king, to\r\nsurrender himself to these. Not only was he vastly rich, and an\r\nextraordinary conqueror, but his chief delight consisted in literature\r\nand science; he patronized the learned and wise of all nations; so much\r\nso that they all made particular effort to visit his dominions to\r\nreceive his assistance. His court was the ordinary residence of the\r\nseven wise men of Greece. It was with him that Æsop, the author of the\r\nFables, flourished. The possession of these characteristics entitle\r\nCrœsus to most honorable mention and memory, and he should be regarded\r\nas a representative king.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that Cyrus was the first king of Persia, which by\r\nconquest he enlarged until it comprised all the territory between the\r\nTigris and Indus, the Caspian Sea and Indian Ocean. His uncle, Cyazares,\r\nretained Medea. He, finding himself involved in a terrible war with the\r\nkings of several provinces—among whom was Crœsus of Lidya—sent to Cyrus\r\nfor aid, who set out at once with an army. The vast preparations made on\r\nboth sides culminated in the battle of Thimbra—one of the most\r\nremarkable events of ancient times—which decided the empire of Asia\r\nagainst the Assyrians and in favor of the Persians. This battle has\r\nalways been the study of great commanders, because the military genius\r\nthere displayed by Cyrus makes him rank as one of the greatest of\r\ngenerals. After reducing all the smaller nations of Asia Minor, Cyrus\r\nturned his whole power against Babylon, which he determined upon\r\ndestroying. He accomplished its capture by emptying the river Euphrates\r\ninto the vast ditches prepared by Semiramis, and marching his army over\r\nits dry bed into the city at night, while its inhabitants were engaged\r\nin some general entertainment. Thus the mighty city built by Semiramis\r\nfell, and the destruction ceased not, until not even its walls remained\r\nto tell the story of its grandeur.\r\n\r\nWith the reunion of what constituted the first Assyrian empire, the\r\nconquests of Cyrus seem to have ceased. He turned his whole attention to\r\nperfecting a system of government for the vast country he had acquired.\r\nThis he accomplished most wisely. All historians agree that in this task\r\nhe was greatly aided by the wisdom and counsel of Daniel the Prophet,\r\nwho obtained a position of great power and influence. It was no doubt he\r\nwho obtained from Cyrus the famous decree regarding the Babylonish\r\ncaptivity of the Jews. So prosperous and happy did the empire become\r\nunder the reign of Cyrus, that historians affirm “that after his death\r\nhe was universally regarded as the common father of the people.” Having\r\nreigned seventy years he died 529 years B. C., leaving the empire to\r\nCambyses, his son, who was as great in crime as his father had been in\r\nvirtue. He caused the death of his only brother, Smerdis, married his\r\nyoungest sister (who was very beautiful), and afterward killed her\r\nbecause she lamented the death of Smerdis. Happily his reign was cut\r\nshort by death, having lasted less than eight years.\r\n\r\nIt was not generally known that Cambyses had caused the death of his\r\nbrother Smerdis, which made it possible for Smerdis the magician to\r\nusurp the throne, giving out that he was the true Smerdis. He was\r\nexposed by one of his wives, at the instance of a nobleman named Darius,\r\nwho managed to slay him, and was then unanimously named king, by his\r\nbrother noblemen, for having done so. Soon after becoming king, Darius,\r\nwith an army of 1,000,000 men, marched into Europe to chastise the\r\nScythians for having overrun Assyria in the time of Cyazares. The\r\nexpedition resulted disastrously to Darius, who could not even bring the\r\nScythians to battle. They continually retired before him, and left him\r\nto be defeated by the scarcity of provisions, from which cause Darius\r\ncame near losing his whole army, and was obliged to beat a hasty retreat\r\nto his own country. Darius then determined upon the conquest of India,\r\nwhich he accomplished. Of the particulars of this campaign no records\r\nare left, though it is known that India remained a Persian province many\r\nyears, and paid annual tributes of £50,0000 sterling. Darius was the\r\nonly conqueror who ever subjugated India sufficiently to reduce it to a\r\ntributary province; it made the twentieth that had been added to Persia.\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of Darius, the Ionians revolted against Persian\r\ncontrol, and succeeded in involving the Athenians with them; they\r\nfurnished the Ionians twenty ships, by the aid of which Sardis was\r\ncaptured and burned. This so enraged Darius that he formed a solemn\r\nresolve to destroy Greece. Thus began that implacable strife of the\r\nPersians against the Grecians, by which Persian power was almost\r\ndestroyed, and in which the Greeks performed the most remarkable\r\nexploits known in military history. These, coming more properly under\r\nGrecian summary, it will only be remarked here that Miltiades on the\r\nplains of Marathon, Leonidas at Thermopylæ, Themistocles at Salamis,\r\nAristides at Plateæ, Leotychides at Mycale, and Simon at Eurymedon,\r\ntaught the Persian monarchs that they were not to be subdued by them,\r\nthough they should expend their mightiest power in their attempts.\r\n\r\nSo exhausted was the empire from the Grecian wars, that when the\r\nEgyptians revolted during the reign of Darius II. he found himself\r\nunable to subdue them. The superb empire made and left by Cyrus the\r\nGreat under such admirable government was now becoming thoroughly\r\ncorrupted and debauched, and was given to all species of licentiousness.\r\nIts former glory rapidly departed, and the elements of destruction were\r\nactively at work preparing it for the blow Alexander of Macedon was soon\r\nto deal it, from which it was destined never to recover.\r\n\r\nAfter the dismemberment of the Macedonian Empire, Persia in part\r\nrecovered, but became the field for constant barbarian inroads, which\r\nkept the kingdom in poverty and misery. Under Chosron, about the year\r\n600, the empire again extended from the Indus to the Mediterranean.\r\nJustinian I. waged a successful war against Chosron, and compelled a\r\ndisadvantageous peace. This was annulled by Chosron II., who again\r\nraised Persia to her former greatness by conquering Egypt, Ethiopia,\r\nLydia and Yemen. These sudden conquests were soon lost, and the\r\npartially resuscitated empire passed into a rapid decline. At no time\r\nsince has Persia exerted any considerable influence upon surrounding\r\nnations. Under Timour, in the fourteenth century, and the Turks in the\r\nfifteenth, it decayed rapidly; in the sixteenth century it became nearly\r\nextinct, and, as a nation, it remains virtually so to this day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     THE TENDENCIES OF GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\n           [Revised from the New York Herald of May 9, 1870.]\r\n\r\n\r\nVICTORIA C. WOODHULL’S FOURTH PAPER—A RETROSPECT OF ANCIENT GRECIAN AND\r\n                             ROMAN HISTORY.\r\n\r\n  [Below we present the fourth subdivision of Mrs. Woodhull’s treatise\r\n  on “The Tendencies of Government,” from which it will be perceived\r\n  that the lady has delved deep into the mines of governmental lore, and\r\n  is vigorously training for the Presidential sweepstakes of 1872:]\r\n\r\nRegarding the earliest traditions of Greece, it can be said they are\r\nless indefinite than those of Egypt or Assyria. No country of antiquity\r\ncan be reverted to with more admiration and respect than this. In\r\nwhatever light her history is considered, illustrious examples of true\r\ngreatness abound. If her military career be reviewed, where can more\r\nglory be found to have been achieved? If her government be examined,\r\nwhere has greater wisdom and moderation ever been exercised? If the\r\ncomparative advancement of science, literature, art and philosophy made\r\nwithin her domain be appealed to, where has greater proficiency ever\r\nbeen attained? If the personal characteristics of her great men be\r\nanalyzed, where has patriotism ever risen to so sublime a degree? In\r\nmany respects Greece may be considered the school-house of the world,\r\nwherein it has been taught the rudimentary principles of knowledge,\r\nespecially that species of knowledge that conduces to the development of\r\nwisdom.\r\n\r\nThe territory of ancient Greece was by no means the Greece of to-day,\r\nbut embraced all that country lying southward from Illyria and Thrace,\r\nnow forming a part of Turkey in Europe. It then consisted of the\r\nprovinces of Epirus, Peloponnesus, Greece proper, Thessaly and\r\nMacedonia, besides many islands in the Ægean Sea. The earliest\r\ninhabitants of Greece of whom anything is known were the Pelasgi, who\r\n“knew no other law than force, were ignorant even of agriculture, and\r\nfed on roots and herbs.” A people called the Hellenes, from Asia,\r\nmingled with them, and their common name became Greeks, from Græcus, the\r\nson of Pelasgus. Although Greece was afterward the seat of so much\r\nknowledge and wisdom, it does not appear that these originated among the\r\ndescendants of its original inhabitants, but that they sprung from the\r\nPhœnecian and Egyptian colonies that from various causes found their way\r\ninto Greece.\r\n\r\nOf the constant internal strife carried on between the several Grecian\r\nprovinces no mention will be made. The first of these to arise was\r\nSicyon, followed by Argos, Mycenæ, Athens, Sparta, Corinth and Macedon.\r\nWhen the population of any of these became large, it was the custom to\r\nsend out colonies, thus distributing Grecian influence, instead of by\r\nwar. The powerful cities of Rhegium, Syracuse, Sybaris, Crotona,\r\nTarentum, Gela, Locris, Messina, Marseilles and Agrigentum, were formed\r\nfrom such colonies. For the space of a thousand years, or until 520\r\nyears B. C., the Grecians appear to have confined their operations\r\nwithin their own dominions. Being continually engaged in war with each\r\nother, they had no opportunity of carrying on aggressive warfare—this\r\nwas never a Grecian characteristic, though so forcibly illustrated by\r\nAlexander of Macedon, and by Cimon and Agesilaus, for retaliation rather\r\nthan aggression.\r\n\r\nIt is to be specially observed as illustrating the part Greece performed\r\nin the general advancement and diffusion of civilization that while all\r\nother great nations were made so by aggressive conquests, Greece rarely\r\never made war except in self-defence. The influence other nations had\r\nupon the world was gained by conquering contiguous countries. The\r\ninfluence Greece exercised was by diffusing among other nations the\r\nprinciples of science, philosophy and government and by commercial\r\nintercourse. Thus it is found that up to the time of the first Persian\r\ninvasion there had been no concentration of the military forces of the\r\nseveral provinces, except as they had taken sides against each other in\r\ntheir feudal wars.\r\n\r\nThe Persian attempt to subjugate Greece was most unpropitious from the\r\nvery onset. Mardonius marched a large army into the very heart of\r\nGreece, with scarcely any opposition; but his fleet, in approaching the\r\ncoast of Macedon, encountered a storm, and was destroyed. Meanwhile,\r\nMardonius took no pains to encamp his vast army in a place or form of\r\nsecurity. A mere band of Thracians, taking advantage of this, fell upon\r\nthe Persians in the night, and completely routed the whole army. This\r\ndouble defeat, by such unexpected means, caused Mardonius to return\r\nquickly into Asia.\r\n\r\nNothing daunted by this defeat, which he attributed to the inexperience\r\nof Mardonius, Darius dispatched another army, consisting of 500,000 men\r\nand 600 ships. The fleet first captured Eretrea, while the army caused\r\nsuch consternation in Greece that only Sparta, of all the provinces,\r\nresponded to the Athenian call for succor. The Spartan troops, even, did\r\nnot arrive in time to participate in the battle of Marathon, where\r\nMiltiades, with 10,000 Athenians, completely routed the whole Persian\r\narmy. This victory gained by the Greeks over an army outnumbering theirs\r\nnearly twenty times, was, no doubt, the inspiring cause by which all\r\nsucceeding victories over the Persians were gained. It taught the Greeks\r\nthat a few determined men, fighting in defence of their country, were\r\nmightier than a multitude with no such incentive. Through the course of\r\nsucceeding ages the Grecians exhibited a noble emulation of, and desire\r\nto imitate, if not excel, their ancestors, who fought and conquered at\r\nMarathon.\r\n\r\nXerxes, the successor of Darius, persisting in his determination to\r\ndestroy Greece, crossed the Hellespont on a “bridge of boats,” with an\r\narmy of 1,700,000 and 80,000 horse, to which submitting countries added\r\n300,000, so that he appeared before the pass of Thermopylæ with\r\n2,000,000 men. Against this force Leonidas opposed 12,000 Spartans and\r\nallies. The whole power of the Athenians had been turned into\r\npreparations for naval warfare, which, as the sequel showed, was the\r\nsalvation of Greece. The manner in which Leonidas and his 300 Spartans\r\ndefended Thermopylæ, still further raised the determination of the\r\nGreeks to resist after the same fashion all movements of the invaders.\r\nOn the same day as the battle of Thermopylæ a great, though indecisive,\r\nnaval battle was fought at Artemesium. Xerxes advanced upon, captured\r\nand burned Athens. The fate of Greece seemed decided; but the great\r\nnaval battle of Salamis entirely changed the face of affairs. Xerxes\r\nbeing secretly informed that it was the intention of Themistocles to\r\nproceed with the Athenian fleet and destroy his “bridge” across the\r\nHellespont, precipitately abandoned Greece, leaving Mardonius with\r\n300,000 men and instructions to subdue Greece “if he was able.” At the\r\nbattle of Platæa, which soon followed, Mardonius was completely\r\ndefeated, and the same day the remainder of the Persian fleet was\r\ndestroyed at Mycale.\r\n\r\nHaving thus rid themselves of the Persians the Athenians set about to\r\nrebuild their city. The Spartans, fearing Athens would gain great naval\r\nsuperiority over them, opposed it; thus the Grecians were no sooner rid\r\nof a common foe than strife broke out among themselves. This tendency\r\narose from the process of individualization and is specially\r\nillustrative of the progress of evolution. Athens was rebuilt, and, as\r\nthe Spartans feared, soon exceeded all other States in power and\r\nsplendor. Athens also became the centre of the arts and sciences,\r\nknowledge of which was at this time rapidly developed. Sparta, no longer\r\nable to endure the overbearing pride of Athens, brought on the\r\nPeloponnesian war. This war devastated Greece and enslaved Athens.\r\nSparta in turn was compelled to yield to Epaminondas, the Theban. In\r\nspite of this terrible war, poets, philosophers, artists and statesmen\r\ncontinued to arise, commerce flourished and the customs of the people\r\nwere raised to the highest degree of perfection.\r\n\r\nBut a time of unhappiness soon came upon this too prosperous condition.\r\nPhilip of Macedon, bold and cunning, took advantage of the dissensions\r\nthat at all times prevailed, and by a sudden _coup de main_ thought to\r\nmake himself master of all Greece. It can be asserted that not Greece,\r\nbut one man, for forty-eight years continually frustrated the designs of\r\nPhilip, who himself said, “The eloquence of Demosthenes did me more harm\r\nthan all the armies and fleets of the Athenians. His harangues are like\r\nmachines of war and batteries raised at a distance, by which all my\r\nprojects and enterprises are ruined. Had I been present and heard that\r\nvehement orator declaim I should have been the first to conclude that it\r\nwas necessary to declare war against me. Nor can I reach him with gold,\r\nfor in this respect, by which I have gained so many cities, I find him\r\ninvincible.” Antipater also says of him, “I value not the galleys nor\r\narmies of the Athenians. Demosthenes alone I fear. Without him the\r\nAthenians are no better than the meanest Greeks. It is he that arouses\r\nthem from their lethargy and puts arms into their hands almost against\r\ntheir will. Incessantly representing the battle of Marathon and Salamis,\r\nhe transforms them into new men. Nothing escapes his penetrating eye,\r\nnor his consummate prudence. He foresees all our designs; he\r\ncountermines all our projects and disconcerts us in everything. Did the\r\nAthenians confide in him and follow his advice we should be irremediably\r\nundone.”\r\n\r\nFrom all that can be gathered about this remarkable man it may seriously\r\nbe considered whether, had he had the power of a Sesostris, a Cyrus or\r\nan Alexander, he would not have conquered and ruled the world. But the\r\nAthenians failed to follow his advice, and were reduced to submission to\r\nMacedon by the youthful Alexander, who said of him, when he passed\r\nThermopylæ, “Demosthenes called me a child when I was in Illyria; he\r\ncalled me a young man when I was in Thessaly: I must now show him before\r\nAthens that I am a man grown.”\r\n\r\nAfter the conquest was complete Alexander summoned at Corinth\r\nrepresentatives from the several Grecian States, and requested from them\r\nthe supreme command of all their armies against the Persians. No\r\nassembly ever held was embryotic of more momentous events. It was the\r\nWestern World taking counsel and resolving upon the destruction of the\r\nEastern, and was the initiatory step to almost incredible events, and to\r\nthe revolutions that were to change the condition of the whole world,\r\nthrough the unexampled career of him who caused its assembling.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Alexander, the several Grecian States renewed the\r\nstruggle for freedom. The Romans, who had risen in the West, becoming\r\ninvolved in the strife, proved fatal to Greece; for in the year 146 B.\r\nC. the capture of Corinth reduced Greece to a Roman province.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole period of strife from the battle of Platæa, the arts\r\nand sciences flourished in a most extraordinary manner. Indeed, it was\r\nthe golden age of art. The Grecian colonies were still more prosperous\r\nthan their mother country. Alexandria, in Egypt, especially, became\r\nfamous as the seat of learning. In the time of Augustus, the Greeks lost\r\neven the shadow of their former freedom and ceased to be an independent\r\npeople; but they became the instructors of their conquerors; for their\r\nlanguage, manners, customs, learning, arts and tastes spread over the\r\nwhole Roman empire. After a time the Romans came to esteem the Greeks as\r\nthe most worthless of creatures.\r\n\r\nAsiatic luxury, acquired from the Persians, had wholly corrupted the\r\nGreek’s ancient love of freedom, and a mean servility became substituted\r\ntherefor. At the beginning of the fourth century the people scarcely\r\nshowed a single trace of their former noble characteristics of\r\nsimplicity and grandeur; and thus Greece passed into her condition of\r\nunimportance.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 ROME.\r\n\r\nRome originally was but an insignificant city, founded on the banks of\r\nthe Tiber by some herdsmen, whose small numbers were swelled somewhat\r\n“by strangers and outcasts from all the country about.” The herdsmen\r\nwere without doubt Pelesgians, who had previously occupied the more\r\neasterly portions of Europe. The language they introduced bears\r\nunmistakable evidence of similarity to the Greek. That a people so\r\nhumble as the original Romans were, who labored principally upon an\r\nunproductive soil for sustenance, should have increased in numbers,\r\npower and influence, so as to rule the world, seems almost incredible;\r\nbut so it was.\r\n\r\nA three-fold division of the people was early spoken of, probably\r\nrepresenting as many different tribes. Each of these tribes was divided\r\ninto ten smaller bodies called “Curial;” in war these divisions were\r\nrepresented by thirty centuries that made up the “legion.”\r\n\r\nThere were very few women among the early Romans. They seized on some\r\nSabine women who came among them to witness their games, which seizure\r\ncaused a war with the Sabines; the result of the war was the union of\r\nthe Sabines with the Romans, and the extension among them of the same\r\nrules and divisions that existed among the Romans. This first conquest\r\nwas prophetic of all future conquests, terminating as it did by the\r\nconquered country being added to Rome to increase its territory and\r\npower. The system of conquest thus begun continued with more or less\r\nactivity during four centuries, when Rome had acquired nearly all the\r\ncountry as far east as the Euphrates. 500 years B. C. Tarquin, the last\r\nking, was expelled by the Senate, and the Roman republic began. During\r\nits first century, contentions among themselves prevented the Romans\r\nfrom materially extending their conquests. About the eightieth year of\r\nthe republic the Gauls first attacked, captured and plundered Rome; nor\r\ncould the Romans expel them until the banished Consul Camillus was\r\nrecalled to command the armies. Soon after this, rapid strides to\r\ngreatness were made, and Rome became the centre of attraction for the\r\nworld. All countries, not already Roman, sought alliance, thereby hoping\r\nto escape conquest.\r\n\r\nIt was during this time of glory that luxury was first admitted and\r\npractised by Romans; and, as in all other countries, it laid the\r\nfoundation for future ruin, by introducing into use licentious, vicious,\r\nand effeminate practices, where simplicity, purity and honor had\r\npreviously held full sway.\r\n\r\nTwo hundred and eighty years B. C. the Carthagenians forming an alliance\r\nwith the King of Syracuse brought on the first Punic war. The Syracusans\r\nsoon deserted to the Romans and ever remained constant to them. The\r\nRomans had now acquired such love of, and thirst for, glory that they\r\nwere considered unconquerable. In Sicily they gained great naval\r\nvictories, and Africa trembled when her fleets neared its shores. The\r\nCarthagenians, through the advice of the Lacedemonian, Xantippus,\r\ndefeated the army commanded by Regulus and captured him; he subsequently\r\nlost his life at the hands of the Carthagenians for opposing at Rome the\r\nconclusion of peace. The war continued by the advice of Regulus, turned\r\nin favor of the Romans, and the Carthagenians were compelled to accept\r\nthe terms of peace offered by the Romans, thus ending the first Punic\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nThe conquest of Seguntum by the Carthagenians, contrary to the terms of\r\npeace, led to the second Punic war, in which the celebrated Hannibal\r\nfigured so conspicuously, and for a time made Rome tremble. From this\r\ntemporary fear the Romans emerged more terrible than ever. They not only\r\nput a stop to the victorious career of Hannibal, but conquered Spain,\r\nand, crossing into Africa, compelled the recalling of Hannibal to defend\r\nCarthage. The famous battle of Zama ensued, in which both Hannibal and\r\nScipio displayed the greatest military talent. The study of this battle\r\nhas since been the admiration of all great military captains. The\r\nvictorious Romans dictated again the terms of peace, which Carthage was\r\nobliged to accept. Thus ended the second Punic war.\r\n\r\nThe ambition of Rome now increased to such an immoderate extent as to\r\nthreaten the reduction of the whole world to submission. Macedon and\r\nSyria endeavored to make head against them, but nothing could withstand\r\nthe irresistible power of the perfectly disciplined Roman legions.\r\nMacedon was glad to end the war by becoming a Roman province, and Syria,\r\nto escape total destruction, by ceding to Rome the larger portion of her\r\nterritory.\r\n\r\nCarthage, the former powerful rival of Rome, still existed, which so\r\nannoyed the Romans that its destruction was determined upon and\r\naccomplished by the third Punic war, which ended 145 years B. C. The\r\ncomplete subjugation of all the Greek and Spanish provinces immediately\r\nfollowed, and Roman power was unparalleled. This begat a spirit of\r\nintolerance which goaded many of her conquered provinces into revolt.\r\nCombining their armies, they for a time successfully resisted the\r\nRomans. Pompey, coming into command, rapidly crushed out all resistance.\r\nInternal contentions between the several factions at Rome quickly\r\nfollowed the reduction of the formidable revolt. Cæsar, Pompey and\r\nCrassus, more active than the rest, divided the government between\r\nthemselves. This was the first triumvirate. Cæsar would have no equal,\r\nand Pompey could endure no superior. The rivalry between these two\r\npowerful men was the initiatory step to the conditions that ruined the\r\nrepublic. Cæsar obtained the consulate and government of Gaul, and began\r\nto lay the foundation for his future greatness by extending his military\r\nenterprises in all directions. He defeated the Swiss, conquered the\r\nGermans, subdued the Belgians, reduced the whole of Gaul, invaded\r\nBritain, imposed tributes upon the people everywhere, and became the\r\nmaster spirit of the time.\r\n\r\nWhen Cæsar returned to Rome Pompey fled. Cæsar then became perpetual\r\ndictator. This was about 50 years B. C. Pursuing Pompey into Greece,\r\nCæsar defeated him at the great battle of Pharsalia, and thus overcame\r\nall opposition to unlimited power. In this possession Cæsar became so\r\nintolerably overbearing that a conspiracy was formed against him, which\r\nresulted in his death at the hands of Brutus. The love of the people,\r\nespecially the women, remained Cæsar’s, so the new ruler found no peace.\r\nThe strife between Brutus, Antony, and Octavius waxed warm, and Rome, as\r\nin the days of Marius and Scylla, became the scene of infamy and horror.\r\nOctavius and Antony, overcoming all opposition, divided the empire\r\nbetween them. Octavius remained in the west, Antony went to the east,\r\nand there became enamored of Cleopatra, the Egyptian Queen, for whom he\r\nabandoned Octavio, the sister of Octavius. This brought about a\r\nconflict, and Octavius proceeded to the east with a great army to\r\nchastise Antony. By the treachery of Cleopatra, whose army and navy\r\ndeserted to Octavius, Antony was totally defeated. The treachery of\r\nCleopatra determined him to take his life, which in turn caused her such\r\ngrief that she sought and found relief through the aspen’s bite.\r\n\r\nOctavius thus became sole master of the mightiest empire the world had\r\never beheld. It comprised nearly every country then known under a\r\nuniversal monarchy. Octavius assumed the title of Augustus Cæsar, and\r\nreigned over this mighty empire forty-five years with the most\r\nconsummate skill and prudence, and with a profound appreciation of the\r\nposition he occupied. It was during his reign that literature flourished\r\nso extensively. The best literary age of all countries has since been\r\ncalled its Augustan age, as likened to that of Rome under him. In the\r\nthirtieth year of his reign Jesus Christ was born. The Roman Empire at\r\nthis time assumed its proudest and grandest pitch of power and glory,\r\nwhich will ever be the wonder and admiration of coming ages, until\r\nanother nation shall arise to a greater and still more glorious\r\ncondition, of which Rome will forever remain prophetic until fulfilled.\r\n\r\nFrom the reign of Augustus to Constantine the Great, who transferred the\r\ncapital to Byzantium, the empire sustained a series of good and bad\r\nrule, and declined somewhat from its previous proud position. On the\r\ndeath of Constantine the Great, Constantine II., Constantius and\r\nConstance divided the empire. Constantine II. had all Europe west of the\r\nAlps; Constantius Italy, Sicily and Africa; and Constance Asia, Egypt\r\nand the whole East. This division was the beginning of the great\r\ndisasters that came fast upon Rome. Constantine and Constantius being\r\ndisposed of by treason, Constance usurped the whole power; being\r\ndestitute not only of all capacity for so extended rule, but also of all\r\nhonor, the empire began to disorganize. During his reign and that of his\r\nsuccessor, until Theodosius, about the year 400, country after country\r\nsuccessfully revolted against the power of Rome. Everything in which her\r\nformer renown and glory consisted degenerated, until Rome was\r\nprecipitated into that condition which ultimated in her entire\r\ndestruction, so that she who so lately was the proud mistress of the\r\nworld, was unable to resist the barbarians of Northern Europe, who\r\nextinguished her light, thereby leaving the world in the midnight and\r\nanarchy of the “Dark Ages.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                             MODERN EUROPE.\r\n\r\nWith the downfall of Rome that portion of history called ancient ceases.\r\nThe numerous provinces of Europe that had been under the Roman power\r\nwere completely under the control of the various barbarians who had\r\ndestroyed that power. Out of this condition of anarchy modern Europe\r\nrose. As it consists of a number of countries their separate histories\r\nwill not be considered; only such prominent facts regarding the whole\r\nwill be observed as seem to indicate and mark its general progressive\r\nsteps.\r\n\r\nFrom the fall of Rome in 476 to the time of Charlemagne in 800, Western\r\nEurope was the scene of those operations that determined its present\r\ndivisions. The barbaric tribes that occupied it were the Vandals, Suevi,\r\nAlans, Visigoths, Burgundians, Germans, Franks, Lombards, Angles, Saxons\r\nand Huns. The Visigoths founded Spain; the Angles and Saxons formed the\r\nseven kingdoms of Britain; the Germans fixed themselves on the Danube,\r\nand from these grew all the German States; the Lombards had Italy, and\r\nthe Franks France. During this period Mohammed founded an empire in\r\nAsia, out of the ruins of which most of the monarchies of Western Asia\r\narose.\r\n\r\nCharlemagne was the ruling spirit of what may be termed the second\r\nperiod of modern European history, from 800 to 1074. Under him France\r\ntook form and rank as one of the first powers of the world, and has\r\nnever since been entirely divested of it. He temporarily re-established\r\nthe Western Empire, but with his death it went to pieces. Spain was the\r\ntheatre of the terrible wars between the Moors and Christians. The seven\r\nSaxon kingdoms were united by Egbert, who became the first King of\r\nEngland. The whole north of Europe was still barbarous, and frequently\r\npoured its hordes over the civilization in the south that was struggling\r\nfor existence. The Danes ravaged England, and became masters of it;\r\nwhile Germany, under Otho the Great, rose to great power. The other\r\npresent European States were still in obscurity.\r\n\r\nThe third period of modern European history extended from 1074 to 1453.\r\nDuring this period the German Empire was the scene of constant quarrels\r\nbetween the Emperors and the Popes, under the factions called Guelphs\r\nand Ghibelines, which dimmed the lustre Otho had conferred on it; Naples\r\nand Sicily were erected into kingdoms by the Normans; Denmark arose to\r\nsome importance under Wildemar II.; in France, legislation and police\r\nrestraints were introduced, but her power was nearly crushed by Edward\r\nIII. of England, which country was in turn deluged in blood by the “Wars\r\nof the Roses;” Genoa and Venice increased in rank and importance; Spain\r\nstill suffered from the Moors; Portugal became a distinct kingdom;\r\nSweden and Norway came into existence; Russia emerged from the barbaric\r\nrule of the Tartars; Poland put on the royal dignity; Hungary and\r\nBohemia were added to Austria, and the Turkish Empire rose to great\r\npower, putting an end to the Eastern Empire. The arts and sciences began\r\nto be cultivated again in the West, and literature and learning to\r\nflourish. Many inventions were produced, such as paper making, printing,\r\nengraving, painting in oil, gunpowder, and the mariner’s compass, and\r\nthis brings us to the fourth period of history, which was pregnant with\r\nevents that were to modify and change the general conditions of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nThe fourth period extended two hundred years to 1650. In it America and\r\nthe West Indies were discovered. The Reformation brought about great\r\nchanges in very many respects in nearly every European country, many of\r\nwhich underwent important revolutions. Germany made important\r\nlegislative improvements; feudal government was destroyed in France;\r\nSpain became a Christian kingdom; England rose to great power,\r\nespecially under Elizabeth; Italy divided herself into numerous small\r\nStates; Switzerland became a republic; the provinces of Holland declared\r\ntheir independence of Spain; Poland flourished; Denmark became of\r\nimportance; affairs in Russia assumed a new appearance, the power of the\r\nTartars being destroyed, and the Ottoman Empire became grand under\r\nSolyman II.\r\n\r\nAbout 1650, the beginning of the fifth historic period, the political\r\nsystems of Europe began to undergo considerable change, which, from\r\nvarious causes, continued until the time of Bonaparte. Revolutions in\r\nEngland, France, Germany and Russia caused various modifications, not\r\nonly in the limits of the various countries, but also in their\r\ngovernments. England and France seemed to divide the other Powers about\r\nequally in the support and continuance of their wars; the general\r\nconfiguration of Europe, however, did not sustain any radical changes.\r\nThis period is important in another and new aspect. Colonies from all\r\nthe western kingdoms were continually going to the new America—that\r\ncountry which should in future exercise such control over the destinies\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time in the history of the world there have arisen single\r\ngreat men who by the grandeur of their enterprises and the power of\r\ntheir intellect and ambition, have left indelible impressions of\r\nthemselves upon its history and condition. Such were Sesostris, Cyrus,\r\nAlexander, Cæsar and Charlemagne. Though they all possessed many traits\r\nof character which the present age cannot admire, they must ever be\r\nregarded as having given general civilization those great impulses that\r\nhave so rapidly evolved the world from barbarism.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the next period another great man appeared, the\r\nwaves of whose power were felt over the whole world, and who, by the\r\ngrandeur of his conceptions, power and executive will, rose from\r\nobscurity to dictate to Europe, which was at that time the world. From\r\n1789 to 1815 may justly be styled the Bonapartean period. It would be\r\nsuperfluous to recapitulate his career; nor would it be less so to trace\r\nthe rescuing of America from the savages by the resistless advance of\r\ncivilization, which, since the settlement of Jamestown, in 1607, has\r\nmade such unexampled progress in all things that pertain to greatness,\r\ngrandeur and glory—in literature, science, art and government.\r\n\r\nBefore closing the _resume_ of general history it should be observed\r\nthat many great events have been passed unnoticed, the principal aim\r\nhaving been to follow the western tendency of empire, and to present\r\nonly such facts as were prominent in forming standards of progress,\r\nperpetual landmarks and historic eras. In Asia particularly, great\r\nevents occurred, such as the career of Ghengis Khan and Tamerlane. The\r\nformer, it is computed, slaughtered fifteen millions of human beings\r\nduring his reign. The efforts of such as he were the last struggles of\r\nbarbarians to arrest the onward course of general progress. Though for a\r\ntime triumphant in their course the genius of progress could never be\r\nentirely eradicated where once it had found root and growth. China and\r\nIndia have been passed because, for the most part, they have been\r\nconfined within themselves; the reason whereof will be discussed\r\nhereafter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     THE TENDENCIES OF GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\n          [Revised from the New York Herald of May 16, 1870.]\r\n\r\n\r\n        VICTORIA C. WOODHULL’S LAST LESSON IN POLITICAL HISTORY.\r\n\r\n  [The following communication from Mrs. Woodhull, who, as the public is\r\n  already informed, has devoted herself to enlightenment on the question\r\n  of government, will be found as interesting as any of her previous\r\n  letters on the same subject This is Mrs. Woodhull’s concluding letter\r\n  on the Tendencies of Government:]\r\n\r\nIn entering upon the next and third part of the subject, we are\r\nconscious of the imperfect construction of the second. It must be\r\nremembered that the purpose of the _resume_ was not to give consecutive\r\nhistoric detail, but to mark such special facts as evidently show there\r\nwas a progressive and consecutive rise and fall of nations. Without\r\napology for omissions and minor errors, we proceed to the consideration\r\nwhether the facts elicited from history form a consecutive chain of\r\nprogress, by which the world has been evolved from barbarism, and\r\nwhether this evolution has been according to present philosophic\r\nformulas. The first and most prominent fact that becomes obvious to the\r\nobserver of general history is that the progress of empire has always\r\nbeen from the east, westward. The progress of the earth in its daily\r\nrotation upon its own axis and also in its orbital movement around the\r\nsun is toward the east. This is believed to explain the order maintained\r\nby the course of empire. Motion being in the direction of the least\r\nresistance, the general tendency of the surface influence of the earth\r\nmust be west. Counter side influences have at times caused deviations\r\nfrom straight lines, but this only makes the general proposition still\r\nmore forcible. Therefore, as a general proposition, the course of empire\r\nand of civilization and population has always been westward.\r\n\r\nIf this proposition is applied to pre-historic times, to govern\r\ndeductions regarding it, neither Assyria nor Egypt can be considered as\r\nhaving been the first powerful empire of the world. It is known that in\r\nthem there existed a numerous and powerful people of whom history fails\r\nto give the exact or even supposed origin; the same is true of all the\r\nsurrounding countries, in Europe, Asia and Africa. If it is allowed that\r\npopulation has resulted from the same general law that civilization has,\r\nit must be admitted that China and India were the predecessors of\r\nAssyria and Egypt.\r\n\r\nAllowing that China and India existed as vast tribal communities\r\nprevious to the historic age of Assyria and Egypt, it will be seen that\r\npopulation, general civilization and improving government crossed Asia\r\nwestward and developed the Assyrian Empire, which, for the same general\r\nreasons must be held the predecessor of Egypt.\r\n\r\nThe Assyrian Empire attained its greatest power under Semiramis, 2,150\r\nyears B. C., which was about the beginning of the historic age of Egypt,\r\nand 700 years before Sesostris conquered the greater part of the known\r\nworld. In whatever comparative light the histories of these two\r\ncountries are viewed, Assyria must be deemed the more ancient empire. It\r\nmay be further observed, if Nimrod was the first King of Assyria, and\r\nthe father of Ninus, who was the husband of Semiramis, the empire came\r\nto its greatest glory in an exceedingly short time. Very many reasons\r\ncan be assigned why Assyria must have been an empire of centuries when\r\nSemiramis reigned.\r\n\r\nThe Assyrian Empire, in the year 2,150 B. C., was the great power of the\r\nworld, having sway over the greater part of Asia and Africa. Seven\r\nhundred years afterward, or 1,499 years B. C., Egypt had risen to its\r\ngreatest glory, and under Sesostris acquired the Assyrian Empire,\r\nbesides a vast country in Europe and Africa which Semiramis had never\r\nsubdued.\r\n\r\nOut of the ruins of Assyria, Babylon, Nineveh and Medea were formed,\r\nand, after being consolidated, were merged into the famous Persian\r\nEmpire by Cyrus, 536 years B. C., or 950 years after the proudest\r\nEgyptian period. The Persian Empire absorbed the Indian and Egyptian,\r\nand became the most splendid power that had existed, and with rising\r\nGreece divided the world.\r\n\r\nGrecian power being concentrated by Alexander of Macedon, he acquired\r\nthe ascendancy over the Persians, and became the world’s conqueror.\r\nNumerous Grecian colonies, following the general tide of influence\r\nwestward, formed powerful kingdoms in various parts of the Mediterranean\r\ncoasts and islands.\r\n\r\nRome, rising to power, contended with Carthage for supremacy in the\r\nwest. Carthage being destroyed by the three Punic wars, the attention of\r\nRoman armies was turned eastward, to gather in the elder empires that\r\nwere verging on decay. Greece, 146 years B. C., became the Roman\r\nprovince of Achaia. Continuing its conquests further, fifty years B. C.,\r\nRome became ruler of a greater part of the inhabited world than any of\r\nthe previous empires, and existed in the utmost pomp and glory several\r\ncenturies, until the northern barbarians swept over and extinguished it.\r\n\r\nNo considerable Power existed after 476, until Charlemagne’s, though\r\nsome influence attached to several Asiatic countries. Civilized nations\r\nwere extinct in Europe. From Charlemagne, in 800, to 1500, civilization\r\ncontinued to rear its blighted head in various parts of Europe, and to\r\nmark the countries that should play the next last act in the drama of\r\nunceasing general progress.\r\n\r\nThe historic age of the world, then, has been occupied thus: The\r\nAssyrian Empire existed and was subdued by the Egyptian, which was\r\nconquered by the Persian, which was destroyed by the Grecian, which was\r\ncompelled to yield to the Roman, which was destroyed by the barbarians,\r\nthat from its ashes numerous kingdoms and empires should arise, to exist\r\ntogether, and to spread over and occupy the outside world Rome had never\r\nknown.\r\n\r\nFrom this succession of empire many deductions might be drawn which\r\nwould assist in forming a well-defined line of progress. Many are so\r\nobvious that it would be superfluous to name them; therefore we leave\r\nthem, with the general observation, that in each succeeding empire the\r\ncondition of the people was more directly and distinctly recognized,\r\nwhile each, in grasping for universal sway, and not possessing the\r\nprinciples upon which universal government was possible, exceeded the\r\nlimits of its central strength, and thereby fell. India and China alone,\r\nof all ancient nations, survive, because they have never sought to\r\nextend their limits, but have expended their strength within their own,\r\nthough it often was in war.\r\n\r\nThe commercial greatness of England, more than any other present\r\nexternally apparent power, is promoting the general assimilation of the\r\nworld. This influence is producing very great and diffusive results in\r\nAsia, Africa and South America, and the way is being opened and cleared\r\nfor more radical and general control. It is impossible that the\r\nincreasing power of civilized and enlightened ideas and customs in\r\nIndia, China and Asia generally, should not revolutionize those\r\ncountries. Many Chinese will return from this country, carrying with\r\nthem the solvent power of the genius of our institutions, which,\r\ncombining with all similar powers, will ere long kindle the flame of\r\npopular individual freedom. This flame will cause republics to spring\r\ninto existence where one form of government has existed through historic\r\ntime over the same defined limits of kingdom. Another great and powerful\r\ninfluence is being evolved that cannot fail to exercise a tremendous\r\nmodifying power over Asia. Russia, the European giant, is slowly but\r\nsurely pushing into Asia from the west. If it continue its present\r\nwell-consolidated home strength, it will absorb Asia until it meet the\r\nsame absorbing process proceeding westward, when Asia will be prepared\r\nfor a still grander consummation.\r\n\r\nIn Europe, Russian influence is also gaining the ascendancy. Though one\r\nof the youngest of European kingdoms, it seems possessed of an inherent\r\nstrength superior to them all, which Bonaparte, with all his terrible\r\npower and ambition, could not scatter nor weaken, and which stands ever\r\nready to gather under its protecting wings the sickening adjacent\r\nkingdoms. At present Russia is biding her time and strengthening her\r\narms, which she is conscious shall soon reach out and grasp all they can\r\ncompass.\r\n\r\nPrussia, meantime, is spending its strength in the vain, though\r\napparently successful, endeavor to consolidate a country under absolute\r\ncontrol, that is impossible of a people so numerously and diffusively\r\nrepresented, in a country where freedom is the rule. Throughout\r\nSouthern, Central and Southwestern Europe, republicanism impatiently\r\nawaits the time to burst forth, and sweep among the debris of the past\r\nall traces of monarchy. The country over which the Roman eagles\r\ntriumphed will again be under a republican form of government, improved\r\nupon that of Rome by 2,000 years of successful experiment. Russia will\r\nthen occupy a central position between the republics of Europe and Asia,\r\nand its emperors be the last to yield their crowns. Like no other\r\ncountry, Russia has vast possessions in the unyielding frigid zone,\r\nwhich gives way but slowly before the gradually equalizing temperature\r\nof the globe, and of the character of which Russian Government naturally\r\npartakes.\r\n\r\nThough revolutionized, Southeastern Asia will remain China and India,\r\nthe ancient Assyrian, Persian and Grecian Empires will be resurrected\r\nunder the consolidated Russian, while Africa will be left for Egyptian\r\ncontrol, the promise of which begins to be visible in the direction\r\ngiven to civilization and commerce by the successful accomplishment of\r\nNechos’ defeated project, and, Egypt returned to be a nation of\r\nimportance. Africa will naturally gravitate to Egypt, as it is possessed\r\nof no other salient point from which dominion and power can spring. In\r\nthis regard Africa differs from all the other grand divisions of the\r\nglobe. The character of its inherent wealth is also different. Other\r\ncountries have their frozen regions, inland seas and marshes, stupendous\r\nmountains and deep jungles, but Africa alone has its Sahara. Commerce\r\nhas scattered the germs of civilization here and there upon the coasts\r\nof Africa, but its central portions are to all intents as undeveloped as\r\nwhen Semiramis went into Ethiopia, and Sesostris levied his tributes of\r\ngold, silver, precious stones and woods. What Africa is held in reserve\r\nfor by the general economy of the universe it is impossible to\r\ndetermine; but that a time will come when her resources will be required\r\nand obtained, is philosophically certain.\r\n\r\nIn Europe, where the more prominent scenes of modern history have been\r\nenacted, a modified method of conquest was begun by its countries,\r\nresembling that which was pursued by ancient Greece. This was not so\r\nmuch a subdual of foreign countries to actual control as it was the\r\ngeneral diffusion among them of civilization upon a more extended scale,\r\nmade possible by improvements in the art of navigation. The assimilation\r\nof the world was thus begun upon a more perfect basis than by force of\r\narms, and which differed widely from it in this fact: that while\r\narbitrary control was at all times open to overthrow, the process of\r\nbecoming alike, could never be interrupted except by the suspension of\r\nintercourse. Under the former, no two empires could exist side by side\r\nfor any length of time without one being subjugated by the other; under\r\nthe latter a number of kingdoms have existed for centuries, and though\r\nfrequently engaged in conflict to settle some dispute of boundary or\r\npolicy, it has seldom been pursued to utter destruction. The same end\r\ngrasped for by Semiramis first and by Bonaparte last is being reached by\r\nthe much more certain though gradual process of assimilation.\r\n\r\nThus far America has been untouched, but its consideration now becomes\r\nnecessary. The Old World, as has been found, must continue its\r\nevolution, until like conditions shall exist everywhere. Similar\r\ninterests beget union. When the general people shall begin to realize\r\nthat their common interests depend upon the interests of each\r\nindividual, one system of government must follow, whether it proceed\r\nfrom one common centre or from several centres.\r\n\r\nWhat is America? Americus Vespucius and Christopher Columbus, acting\r\nupon sound scientific principles, discovered to the inhabitants of the\r\nOld World a new country, that was to be a haven of retreat for such of\r\nthem as sought greater freedom and better equality, in which\r\nindividuality could expand without coming in contact and being dwarfed\r\nby personal government. In continuing to be this haven of retreat it has\r\nbecome the representative country of the world. To its hospitable and\r\never-inviting shores people of all nations and climes have come, so that\r\nin two centuries the principal country of it has grown to be a Nation of\r\nmore inherent strength than any country of the Old World, and to rank\r\namong its nations as a first class Power, both feared and respected.\r\n\r\nThe United States of America, all genuine Americans believe, will become\r\nthe United American States. The very name is prophetic of what shall be,\r\nwhile the progress made in that direction begins to give well-defined\r\noutlines of it. Beginning on the Atlantic coast an infant republic, the\r\nUnited States has stretched its arms westward across the Continent. The\r\nsame oceans that bound the east and west of the Old World wash its\r\neastern and western shores. Having gained ocean-bound limits\r\nlatitudinally, which form a central basis of strength, it will expand\r\nlongitudinally until it shall become an ocean-bound republic—a grand\r\nconfederation of States and interests, which, while being peculiarly\r\nAmerican, will be so far cosmopolitan as to represent the descendants of\r\nevery nation of the world—we no longer say of the known world. Europe\r\nhas its well-defined limits of kingdoms and states, the people of which\r\nseldom pass from one to the other to become citizens; so also has Asia,\r\nwhile Africa is more nearly homogeneous; but they all give up their\r\npeople to America. America, besides being American, is European, Asiatic\r\nand African, while each of these is becoming American. No well-informed\r\nperson doubts that the progressive greatness, of republican forms of\r\ngovernment, is rapidly dissolving the strength and solidity of all the\r\nmonarchies of the Old World; though they may affect to despise\r\nrepublics, and to call ours a failure, their subjects are anxiously\r\nasking, When can we successfully revolutionize? Though such a step may\r\nnot be openly advocated by any, it is, nevertheless, secretly discussed,\r\nand preparatory means are being devised, in every country.\r\n\r\nAnd for these reasons the United American States will be the\r\nrepresentative country of the world. Some may argue, because the\r\ncommercial power of England is so superior; because she has such\r\nnumerous general possessions, the English language being the one that\r\nmust become universally used, that, by virtue of these, that dignity\r\nbelongs to England. The fact cited above, showing that the general\r\ndisintegrating influence of the world centres and is integrated in the\r\nUnited States, is a sufficient answer to such an illegitimate\r\nargument—illegitimate, because it is evident to all, that the process of\r\nthe diffusion of English influence throughout the world is, so far as\r\nEngland is concerned, one of disintegration; while that going on upon\r\nAmerican soil is diametrically opposite, being most decidedly one of\r\nintegration. If the process of integration is pursued until it\r\nculminates, and the argument is educed that disintegration must follow\r\nin America as it has in England, it may be answered that the English\r\ninfluence that is being diffused world-wide is peculiarly English;\r\nwhile, when that process shall have commenced in America, it will\r\nproceed from a centre formed by previous influx from all countries in\r\nthe world, and in this sense is not a process of disintegration, but\r\nsimply of reaction.\r\n\r\nThe general law of direction for population and civilization was\r\nwestward until it had encircled the globe, and in their last conquest\r\nfound a country of sufficient inherent vitality to attract all other\r\ncountries toward it. Not only does the tide of influence continue to\r\nflow to America from the east, but since her power has made itself felt\r\nupon the Pacific coast, the same tide has set in from the west, and Asia\r\npours her surplus population upon our western coast, which exemplifies\r\none of the modifying portions of the rule of motion. For the time,\r\ntherefore, though preponderant commercial importance must be accorded\r\nEngland, the United States thereby loses none of its general prestige as\r\nthe representative country of the world.\r\n\r\nFrom whatever point consideration begins, the conclusion that is\r\ninevitably reached is, that the world must, in due time, become subject\r\nto one system of government. Whether that system shall at first proceed\r\nfrom one common centre or from several centres, is not so presently\r\napparent, though that such a consolidation will be ultimately reached no\r\none can doubt, who gives proper weight to the established fact that all\r\nperfect things become universal. So it is with everything of vital\r\ninterest to the general people; rapid and sufficient communication is\r\nthe only limiting power that controls their diffusion. In proportion as\r\nthe diffusive means increase, in number and extent, so do the interests\r\nof the people become proportionately assimilated and best systems\r\nprevail.\r\n\r\nA striking exemplification of the benefit that would flow from the\r\nadoption of general systems in all things may be drawn from the system\r\nof international telegraphing. A universal language in this becomes of\r\nthe first importance. How much more important when the general uses and\r\nbenefits are considered. The adoption of a universal language would\r\nremove the greatest obstacle from the path of the general diffusion of\r\nknowledge and innumerable difficulties from methods of communication.\r\n\r\nIt should be further observed, that the same law governs in all\r\ncommunications between the different countries. This is a necessity, in\r\norder that the intercourse may be preserved and be at all times safe.\r\nShould it be inquired, how much of the common law of the world is\r\nsimilar, the answer returned would astonish all who had not given it\r\nconsideration, by being so considerable a portion of the whole. Were the\r\ninquiry pressed further, to find how great modifications of common law\r\nwould be required in the various nations to make a common administration\r\npossible to all, a still greater astonishment would be developed by the\r\nslight disparities that would be shown to exist.\r\n\r\nIt has been remarked that England has possessions in very many latitudes\r\nand longitudes of the world. Over these possessions a governing control\r\nis exercised, which control foreshadows the possibility of a government\r\nthat shall control every country in all latitudes and longitudes. When\r\nit is remembered that the countries of Asia are practically as near\r\nWashington as California, there can be no argument deduced from distance\r\nagainst a common and world-wide administration of government. The broad\r\nassertion is made, that there is no argument against universal\r\ngovernmental administration, but that every possible argument urges all\r\npeople to prepare for it as the thing of all things to be desired by\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIt only remains for some one of the great countries of the world to\r\narrive at, or to approximate to, a perfect system of government that\r\nshall contain the elements and principles of sufficient inherent\r\nstrength, to insure to that country the power which shall control the\r\ndestinies of the world. From what has been said regarding the position\r\nof the United States, it must be admitted, that nearly all the natural\r\nadvantages, as well as the general order of things, are on this side of\r\nthe globe. If any conclusions naturally flow from the observation of the\r\npast tendencies in the order of nature, they are that the United States\r\nis destined to be the centre of a universal government.\r\n\r\nThe tendencies of government from earliest historic time have\r\npersistently been to universal sway. The systems and forms through which\r\nthis tendency has been manifested have changed from time to time, as the\r\ncircumstances that created them—the environment—the sum total of the\r\ngoverned—have changed. These systems will continue to be modified, until\r\nthis tendency shall have opened such channels for itself, as will permit\r\nfree and untrammeled action; until these channels shall have encircled\r\nthe world, and its utmost limits shall have been attracted within the\r\nrealm of its positive flow and negative reaction, and until the\r\ncommanding magnetic influence that shall proceed from its central seat\r\nof power shall reach all subjects and find in their general heart an\r\nanswering response of fidelity and confidence.\r\n\r\nIn such fidelity and confidence each and all can safely and earnestly\r\ndevote themselves to the best aims and wisest purposes of life—to\r\nintellectual, moral and spiritual growth. In this general and universal\r\npursuit the millennium, so long prophesied and prayed for, can alone be\r\ngained, through which reaching, the government of heaven can alone be\r\nadministered on earth.\r\n\r\nGovernment, then, will be no longer one of physical force, but of the\r\nmore powerful control of wisdom, including, perhaps, modified forms of\r\nforce. Caste will no longer be distinction regarding material position\r\nor possession, but in moral and spiritual position and intellectual\r\npossession. In such government and caste a true aristocracy can exist in\r\nthe midst of a true democracy. All will be born free and entitled to the\r\ninalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness in\r\nself-chosen paths, which alone is perfect equality. Perfect equality in\r\nthe order of nature does not presuppose that all shall be alike, but it\r\ndoes presuppose that all shall be equal in the right to apply their\r\nnatural or acquired talent according to the dictates of the power that\r\ngoverns them—the same as the flower and the tree follow their natural\r\ncourses, and are equal, but not alike. As the lightning and the\r\nsunshine, the mountain and the river, the bird and the bee, the\r\nearthquake and the storm, follow their natural courses and tendencies\r\nunder the government of the universal God, so shall the people follow\r\ntheirs under a universal social government, when fashioned after the\r\nsame general principles that obtain in the domain of nature. For\r\n\r\n                  Honest nature’s voice shall give\r\n                  The laws to man by which he’ll live.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen, then, that the philosophic formulæ that it has been\r\ndemonstrated the evolution of matter conforms to, apply with equal\r\nforce, effect and directness to the evolution of society, which is the\r\nfruit, so to speak, of the evolution of matter. The evolution of\r\nsociety, then, is “a continuous establishment of psychical relations\r\nwithin the community, in conformity to physical and psychical relations\r\narising within the environment, during which both the community and the\r\nenvironment pass from a state of incoherent homogeneity to a state of\r\ncoherent heterogeneity, and during which the constitutional units of the\r\ncommunity become ever more distinctly individualized.” Thus it has been\r\nfrom the earliest existence of communities, and this formulæ applies to\r\nall communities, whether Assyrian or American.\r\n\r\nThe process of revolution in its ultimate effects brings about a perfect\r\nstate of action and reaction in all the various productions of nature,\r\nby which they are first perfected and then destroyed. The process in\r\nsociety must also continue until an equilibrium shall have been attained\r\nbetween the governing power and the power governed. When this is reached\r\nits perpetual continuance will depend solely upon the perpetuity of that\r\nover which it acts, or upon continuous individual existence. Continuous\r\nexistence does not belong to the kingdoms below man, but does to man,\r\nfrom the fact that inherent within his consciousness there is a\r\npersistent though utterly unexplainable and undefinable knowledge of\r\ncontinuous existence, which is forever independent of all the changeable\r\ncircumstances of the purely material, and which represents in him that\r\ncharacteristic of Divine power exhibited everywhere in the universe\r\nwhich is forever beyond scrutiny and limitation.\r\n\r\nThis evidence of Divine power within the individual, then, is the\r\ndistinction between man as the product of nature and all other products\r\nof nature; while the consciousness of its existence is the direct\r\nevidence to the understanding that as the Divine power is eternal, so\r\nmust that within be, which partakes of it, or is made up of its\r\nessential attributes.\r\n\r\nIt becomes the duty, then, of each individual who can catch but faint\r\nglimpses of such a consummation as universal government, to point it out\r\nand to assist by all legitimate means in the dissemination of light upon\r\nit and all relevant subjects. It becomes the duty of each nation to see\r\nthat its people are educated to the same ultimate perception; and\r\nspecially does it become the duty of that nation which seems appointed\r\nby the Divine order of things to become the central power of all the\r\nrest to push its influence and the genius of its institutions abroad and\r\ninto every nation. A mere passive acquiescence in this Divine\r\nappointment will not suffice; an active and positive acceptance of the\r\nmission, and the faithful and persistent performance of the great trust,\r\nis required.\r\n\r\nWhen the people of this country shall rise to a true and competent\r\nconception of the responsibilities of the position assigned it in the\r\norder of the universe, the present system of things will undergo such\r\nrapid transformations as no revolution ever yet accomplished, and to\r\nwhich the destruction of the Roman empire by the barbarians can alone\r\ncompare in magnitude. By that the dominion of the world was wrested from\r\nRome; by this that shall come, it shall be restored to that country of\r\nwhich Rome was the Divine prophecy. Personal, sectional and national\r\nmotives will be sunk in oblivion, and such governing rules of action\r\nwill obtain as shall bring the world into intimate, harmonious and\r\nDivine relations, such as will know no Jew nor Christian, Mohammedan nor\r\nPagan, but one general and acknowledged brotherhood of man, flowing from\r\nthe common fatherhood of God.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         [Editorial from the New York Herald of May 27, 1870.]\r\n\r\n                      WOMAN’S IDEA OF GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe public have, during the past few months, been interested and perhaps\r\nedified by the ideas and impressions put forth by Mrs. Victoria C.\r\nWoodhull upon the broad, general subject of human government, as well as\r\nby her subsequent nomination of herself as a candidate for the\r\nPresidency in the election of 1872. The articles in which she has\r\nannounced these views and purposes have from time to time appeared in\r\nthe _Herald_, and to-day we present a further communication on the\r\nquestion of the “Limits and Sphere of Government.” It is evident Mrs.\r\nWoodhull is imbued with at least one very sensible idea, and that idea\r\nis one which it would be well for large numbers of aspirants for public\r\npositions to emulate—viz., that fitness is the first prerequisite of\r\nqualifications entitling the seeker to enjoy the position sought for.\r\nThis it is, doubtless, which has led her not only to study and perfect\r\nherself in the nature of the functions she seeks to exercise, and their\r\neffect, but, in the honest belief that she does understand the question,\r\nto give her opinions to the people, that they may judge of her ability\r\nand the correctness of her views.\r\n\r\nAt the same time it is somewhat difficult to see what good will come out\r\nof this particular Nazareth. Mrs. Woodhull offers herself in apparent\r\ngood faith as a candidate, and perhaps has a remote impression, or\r\nrather hope, that she may be elected, but it seems that she is rather in\r\nadvance of her time. The public mind is not yet educated to the pitch of\r\nuniversal woman’s rights. At present man, in his affection for and\r\nkindness toward the weaker sex, is disposed to accord her any reasonable\r\nnumber of privileges. Beyond that stage he pauses, because there seems\r\nto him to be a something which is unnatural in permitting her to share\r\nthe turmoil, the excitement, the risks of competition for the glory of\r\ngoverning. There is therefore but one position that may be taken in\r\nconsidering the aim of this ambitious lady, and that is that, perceiving\r\nand fully appreciating the natural obtuseness of man, she has boldly put\r\nherself forward with a view to wearing down these scrupulous angles in\r\nhis sympathetic character and nature, and that she will, after all, be\r\ncontent with the knowledge that she has done her full share in educating\r\nhim for the new order of things which shall supervene when woman, in all\r\nmatters, has equal rights and duties with him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    LIMITS AND SPHERE OF GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\n          [Revised from the New York Herald of May 27, 1870.]\r\n\r\n\r\n MRS. WOODHULL’S LATEST EPISTLE TO THE AMERICANS—“THE LIMITS AND SPHERE\r\n         OF GOVERNMENT” CONSIDERED FROM A FEMALE POINT OF VIEW.\r\n\r\n  [In the following communication Mrs. Woodhull, whose former essays on\r\n  political matters have been published in the HERALD, considers the\r\n  question of government with special reference to the system under\r\n  which we live in the United States:]\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving in “The Tendencies of Government” traced the rise and fall of\r\nnations, and found that from earliest historic time to the present,\r\nthere has been a continual grasping for universal power, and a constant\r\nfailure to maintain the extent of control actually reached; that the\r\nsystems through which universal control was sought were too imperfect to\r\nadmit of support for any great length of time over an extended area of\r\ncountry; that the general order of the world seems to indicate that\r\nuniversal government will become a fact, and that the United States\r\nshall be the seat of such governmental power, we may now come to\r\nconsider what control a government must be invested with in order that\r\nit shall at all times meet the demands of the people and the times, and\r\ntherefore be continuous while becoming universal.\r\n\r\nIt is predicated that government exists by the consent of the governed.\r\nWhile this is nominally true, it virtually contains but an undeveloped\r\ngerm of truth. In no country as yet does the government exist by the\r\nconsent of the governed. In this country least of all does it apply,\r\nthough superficially it may not so appear.\r\n\r\nGovernment is universal. All things in all the various kingdoms of\r\nnature are the objects of governing laws which form the subjective order\r\nof the universe. In all natural government the relations between the\r\ngoverning power and the powers governed are always well defined, while\r\nthe requirements of the governed are always met by requisite modes of\r\nadministration. Each coming demand falls into some common method of\r\nbeing answered. Thus, in the greatest conceivable diversity of\r\nconditions, are found the fewest and simplest laws of control. Rising\r\nfrom purely material to the more refined powers of mind, represented\r\nonly in the human, a new phase of development springs up. Being an\r\nindividualized power within itself, the human family represents the\r\ndivine power that controls the whole, and in this relation fashions its\r\ngovernments according to the limitations of its acquired standard of\r\nwisdom, which must always necessarily be imperfect in comparison with\r\nthe common laws of the universe, in the same proportion as human wisdom\r\nis imperfect when compared with divine wisdom.\r\n\r\nThe world of mind has now arrived at an age and corresponding\r\ndevelopment, which begins to comprehend the general laws of the\r\nuniverse, and to understand their great simplicity and perfect\r\nadaptation to all things under them. Seeing that such a perfect system\r\nof government exists throughout the universe of matter, the inquiry is\r\nbeginning to be earnestly made, why the universe of mind cannot be\r\ncontrolled by equally simple and general laws and systems of\r\nadministration. Seeing that changes are never necessary in the common\r\nuniversal laws, the inquiry is also beginning to be made, why the laws\r\nthat govern society cannot be so fashioned after the laws of nature as\r\nnot to require the constant remodelling now necessary when changes come,\r\nin the circumstances required to be met.\r\n\r\nThe solution of the difficulty in which the mind becomes involved when\r\nconsidering these most serious questions, seems reduced to a single\r\nproposition—that all strifes, difficulties and controversies regarding\r\ngovernment and its administration, arise from the fact, that the\r\ngoverning power is not general but specific in its operations, or that\r\nthe powers governed are not subservient to a common law of control. This\r\nis still more clearly perceptible if the question of “reserved rights”\r\non the part of any of the governed is considered. No individual can have\r\na reservation that militates against the general welfare of others, or\r\nthe whole, without specific laws to sustain him in it. If no individual\r\ncan have such special reservation, no number of individuals less than\r\nthan the whole, can have reservations without specific protection.\r\nTherefore no city, county, State, or number of them, less than all\r\ncities, counties and States forming a consolidated union, can hold in\r\nreserve any rights or privileges that do not contribute to the general\r\nwelfare of the whole, without sooner or later coming into conflict\r\nregarding them. This theory of reserved rights was pretty forcibly,\r\nlogically and effectually refuted by the late war; so must all such\r\nreservations be equally well refuted before permanent peace, harmony and\r\nprosperity can be expected to flow from government and it remain\r\npermanent.\r\n\r\nAnalytically and philosophically considered, government exists for the\r\ngeneral good of all the governed, in which individual rights and\r\nprivileges can find freedom and justice without conflict. All systems\r\nthat exist upon a less comprehensive basis than this must eventually be\r\nswept away. All parts of systems that conflict with the general\r\nfundamental propositions in which they were based and reared must be\r\nexpunged, so that administration can be in perfect harmony with\r\nprofession, before it will be possible for general good to flow from\r\nadministration. The fundamental propositions upon which this government\r\nprofesses to rest—that all men and women are born free and equal and\r\nentitled to the inalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of\r\nhappiness—are in accordance with the general order of the universe below\r\nman, and are therefore of the highest possible authority.\r\n\r\nThat all are born free is a proposition that no one can question; but\r\nthis freedom is general to all, and does not refer to the individual,\r\nnor entitle him or her to push his freedom so as to encroach upon the\r\nsame freedom guaranteed to every other individual. Therefore, individual\r\nfreedom is merged in, and is a part of, general freedom.\r\n\r\nThat all men and women are born equal is another strictly philosophic\r\nproposition that can never be refuted by the concurrent scientific truth\r\nthat no two of the whole are born alike in every particular. Equality,\r\nin a philosophic sense, does not imply similarity or even likeness; one\r\nthing may be equal to another, or a number of others, and still be\r\nunlike them all. A pound of feathers is equal to a pound of lead in\r\ngravitating power, but the lead does not resemble the feathers in any\r\nrespect; hence, equality does not presuppose likeness.\r\n\r\nThe pursuit of happiness is an additional common right, naturally\r\nresulting from freedom and equality, and which can be prosecuted in any\r\ndirection that does not interfere with the general pursuit of it on the\r\npart of the whole. From this analysis of inherent rights it would seem\r\nthat it should be the sphere of government to maintain such freedom and\r\nequality, and thus guarantee to all and every the pursuit of happiness,\r\nand to protect them therein; and, co-relatively, that the limits of\r\ngovernment should be nothing less than the circle that will permit such\r\nfatherly—such motherly—control.\r\n\r\nIt will scarcely be questioned by those who accept the evolution of\r\ngovernment as a common law, that the government of this country, as a\r\nsystem, comes nearer being an exponent of the philosophic limit and\r\nsphere than that of any other country, though it must be confessed that\r\nthe practices under it belie its fundamental principles. So much is this\r\ntrue, that, while it is safe to assert of the system that it is the best\r\nof all, scarcely one can be named wherein so great distinctions obtain\r\nbetween the intentions of the system and the effects obtained by its\r\nadministration. This follows because, having asserted fundamental\r\nprinciples of freedom and justice, the lines of policy pursued have not\r\nbeen shaped by them. The principles have been lost sight of in the\r\npursuit of party and personal or sectional policies, so that the\r\ngovernment is no longer an exponent of principles, but rather of the\r\npersons, parties or sections which have raised themselves above\r\nprinciples as authorities: hence the government has limitations put upon\r\nthe operations of its principles, and becomes thereby inconsistent\r\nwithin itself.\r\n\r\nAll the corrupt practices that are prevalent in the various parts of the\r\ngoverning process are possible only because the professions and\r\npractices of government are not in harmony. The professions of\r\ngovernment relate to principles; the practices to its limits and sphere.\r\nTherefore, in the present article, the practices will be dealt with. In\r\ndealing with them it will come within the intended limits to examine the\r\nmachinery by which government is administered, and to determine what\r\nmovements within the body of society should be under its general\r\ncontrol, so that all its movements may be made in harmony. Were any\r\nother branch of government than that relating to society being examined,\r\nits limits and sphere would be found so plainly determined there would\r\nbe no possibility of even apparent departure by the governing control\r\nfrom them; for in all these the divine power is that control, and\r\nconsequently is perfect. In society, the divine power, though the\r\ncontrolling element, is maintained over human minds, which are finite\r\nand imperfect representatives of the divine power, and are thereby\r\nincompetent to so arrange and order subservient circumstances, that\r\nharmony shall be the only result of the combinations formed to secure\r\nconsecutive order.\r\n\r\nThe government of this country is selected for analysis because, as a\r\nsystem, it is the latest production of the social order of things, and,\r\nconsequently, the highest in the scale of evolution. It represents a\r\ngreater “coherent heterogeneity” in its construction than any other, and\r\nits “constituent units” are more “distinctly individuated,” which\r\ndemonstrates that it is the highest order of government yet attained on\r\nthe globe. The fault in its construction is, that the powers of the\r\nconstituent units are not harmoniously related to the central power, nor\r\nto each other, discord being the natural consequence of such inequality.\r\nThough the constituent parts of society are in themselves imperfect,\r\ntheir relations to each other and to the governing power may be so well\r\ndefined and regulated that their imperfections shall not have power to\r\nmar the harmony of action proceeding from the central power. And this is\r\nthe point which is sought.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    LIMITS AND SPHERE OF GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\n          [Revised from the New York Herald of June 4, 1870.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGRAVELY IMPORTANT QUESTIONS CONNECTED WITH GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATION AND\r\n  ITS ADMINISTRATIVE DEVELOPMENT, AS VIEWED AND REVIEWED BY ONE OF THE\r\n                 FIRM OF FEMALE BROKERS OF WALL STREET.\r\n\r\nThere are a variety of operations, natural and artificial, by which the\r\nproper limits and sphere of government may be illustrated. It is\r\ndesirable that some of them be presented, so as to convey a correct idea\r\nof a perfect controlling power, which bears the same relations to the\r\nparts controlled as government should to the people under it.\r\n\r\nThe cotton mills of New England are good artificial representatives of\r\ngovernment. In them all the various parts are compelled into unity of\r\naction by the controlling power evolved from coal or transformed from\r\nwater. The crude cotton is first taken and freed from all foreign\r\nsubstances by “the picker;” the pure remainder is then formed into a\r\nhomogeneous mass by “the cards;” this mass is then divided and\r\nsubdivided into the different degrees of heterogeneity required, and\r\nthese are more distinctly individuated into “the webbing and filling” by\r\n“the jacks and mules,” and are then reunited by “the webber and loom”\r\ninto cotton cloth, the ultimate result. Every part of this process forms\r\npoints of resistance more or less easily compelled into unity of\r\npurpose. Every bobbin, spindle, shuttle and card are so many different\r\nexperiences which are required to be gone through with before the result\r\ncan be reached, while all parts of the process are going on at the same\r\ntime. The power is the government; the operatives its administrators;\r\nthe various pieces and parts of the machinery are the people working in\r\nthe several parts of the process; the cloth is the attained\r\ncivilization, while the different degrees of fineness are its\r\nprogressive steps.\r\n\r\nThus it should be with human government. It is the power resident in the\r\ncentral part which should control all the processes by which the people\r\nare guided to produce the ultimate result. It should be of such\r\ncharacter as to take the people in the homogeneous mass, and, by\r\npicking, carding, spinning and weaving, compel them into a unit of\r\naction for divine use. Every operation in nature, if analyzed, presents\r\nthe same process and similar results. A central power competent for its\r\npurposes, through various means and avenues, controls the materials into\r\nperfected productions, each one of which is perfect of its kind. The\r\nsphere of this government is to produce the legitimate result; and its\r\nlimits are only bounded by the necessities of the power that the result\r\nshall flow; but flow it must and does always.\r\n\r\nIt is then predicated, that a power, competent to produce harmony in\r\nthat over which it reigns, must be sufficient to control all the\r\ndifferent parts to one end; whatever individual or combined points of\r\nresistance may be raised to its edicts must yield to the general\r\npurpose, even to the extinction of their resistance. It is necessary,\r\ntherefore, that the governing power must be invested by the governed\r\nwith the necessary control, to compel them into harmonious action, so\r\nthat no antagonism may arise, to divert the tendency to unity of\r\npurpose. It must not be supposed that a self-constituted, absolute power\r\nis argued for; but this power should be one fashioned and organized by\r\nand with the consent of the people, who, knowing their weakness and\r\nacknowledging it in their sober and wiser moments, shall recognize the\r\nnecessity of it, to compel them, if need be, to act with the general\r\nwhole for the general good, even if it seemingly militate against their\r\nindividual good, and which shall be of sufficient strength and\r\ndiffusiveness to regulate all the movements within the body of society.\r\n\r\nWe will now proceed to the analysis of the various operations of\r\ngovernment, to find to what the inharmonious relations between the\r\ngoverning power and the resistance are attributable, and thereby be able\r\nto determine the required remedy. Wherever this may lead, whatever\r\n“infallible” political dogmas it may destroy, or cherished forms and\r\nprivileges disprove, it will be pursued as relentlessly—unmercifully if\r\nyou will—as the crucible and the flame proceed to disorganize material\r\ncompounds and separate their constituent elements into the poisonous,\r\nthe nutritious and the useful, that the former may be put away and the\r\nremainder appropriated to promote the general good.\r\n\r\nGovernment has its centre and its circumference. From its centre its\r\npower is distributed to its entire circumference, measuring and shaping\r\nthe various channels through which it flows, into such form as permits\r\nharmony in all its parts, and, having spent its positive force, is then\r\nreturned to its centre. This centre and circumference must be the\r\nperfect body, every member of which must not only bear its proper\r\nrelations to all the other members, but must be in such accord with\r\nthem, as to permit the uninterrupted flow and action of the power by\r\nwhich the whole is bound together. No individual member of it can say to\r\nthe body itself, “I have functions and rights peculiarly my own, which,\r\nif they are not such as your general power can recognize as contributing\r\nto the general good, you cannot interfere with.” The member, in becoming\r\nsuch, merges its function and power with the general functions and\r\npowers of the body. By consenting to become a part of the body it gives\r\nup special sovereignty over itself and becomes a part of the general\r\nsovereignty. By adding its life and power to the body, it increases the\r\nsum total of its life and power and receives its portion of the\r\naggregated and assimilated mass. Its parts and functions must change—if\r\nchange is required—so that the power distributed to it by the general\r\npower can perform its mission in harmony with all its other parts. Like\r\nthe body human, the body corporate must be under one governing power,\r\nwhile each part is different in form from all other parts, and performs\r\nseparate—perhaps distinct—functions. The eye may not say to the ear, nor\r\nthe hand to the foot, “I have no need of you,” for each and all, are\r\nalike dependent upon a central part for existence, while the central\r\npart could not itself exist without the surrounding and distant parts.\r\nThe very nature of the compact is, that each and every part is joined in\r\na system of mutual and reciprocal interdependence, to which general\r\nsystem no member can set up for itself any system peculiarly its own, in\r\ncontradistinction or opposition to, or to interfere with, the general\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nThe government of any country, originally, is a compact among a certain\r\nnumber of previously separate or unorganized powers, by which they merge\r\nand consolidate into one power, or are compelled so to do. This power,\r\nso formed, is the governing power, which, while all parts have\r\ncontributed to its formation, is in itself superior to any power that\r\ncan be organized within its limits by any part of the originally\r\nconsolidating powers. If at any time an opposition is organized to it,\r\nthe result must either be, the reduction of the opposition or the\r\ndestruction of the confederation. For a natural illustration the human\r\nbody is again referred to.\r\n\r\nIf from any cause an opposition to the harmonious action of the general\r\npowers of the body be raised, a contest for supremacy is inevitable. If\r\nthe bowels refuse to perform their allotted part in the general economy\r\nof the whole, a conflict ensues, and never ends until they are returned\r\nto duty or until they demonstrate that their opposition to the general\r\nadministration is more powerful than its general power, and that the\r\norganization must be dissolved in conformity to this power. On the other\r\nhand, the general power cannot compel any of the constituent parts to\r\nconform to rules and forms not operative in the whole, nor to bear any\r\ninequality of any kind, nor to perform duty outside its special sphere.\r\nThe governing power, though superior to all, must itself be subject to\r\nthe common law of justice. Specialties of conferment or requirement are\r\nutterly inconsistent with a perfect form of government. The same rule of\r\ncontributing to the general support, and in turn receiving appropriate\r\nsustaining power, must be uniform throughout the whole. Such a body,\r\nthus acting, be it human or corporate, is alone a healthy and\r\nharmoniously constituted power. All governments, to be able to\r\ncontribute to the public welfare, must exist upon general similar\r\nprinciples and act by similar means.\r\n\r\nIt must again be observed that when several parts or powers are\r\norganized into one, no power less than the whole has authority therein;\r\nfor, in consenting to the union at first, all absolute individuality is\r\nforever waived; the individual is no longer simply an individual power,\r\nbut forms a part of the common power. Nor can absolute individuality\r\never again be maintained, except a superior antagonistic strength is\r\ndeveloped, which demonstrates that the powers originally attempted to be\r\nconsolidated were impossible of harmonious action—a natural and\r\nsufficient reason for dissolution. Tested by these propositions, what\r\nconditions and relations does the government of the United States, as a\r\nwhole composed of parts, present? Does it form one homogeneous whole,\r\nthe paramount interests of the parts of which is the best welfare of the\r\nwhole? Does each and every part act in unity and harmony with every\r\nother part, and in turn yield to the preponderant authority of the\r\nwhole, with that grace and dignity which bespeak unison of purpose and\r\ninterest? If not, where does the difficulty find its starting point? Is\r\nit in the system by which the power was organized—in the interpretation\r\nof it, or in its administration? For this the Constitution must be\r\nreferred to to find wherein, if at all, its organization is defective.\r\nIf the conferment of power by the organization is complete, then it must\r\nbe concluded that those who administer its organic force either fail to\r\ncomprehend the extent of its application or to perform their duty in\r\napplying it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    LIMITS AND SPHERE OF GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\n          [Revised from the New York Herald of June 19, 1870.]\r\n\r\n\r\n     ANOTHER LETTER FROM VICTORIA C. WOODHULL ON POLITICAL HISTORY.\r\n\r\nARTICLE IX. of Amendments to the Constitution declares that “The\r\nenumeration in the Constitution of certain rights shall not be construed\r\nto deny or disparage others retained by the people.”\r\n\r\nART. X.—“The powers not delegated to the United States by the\r\nConstitution, nor prohibited by it, to the States, are reserved to the\r\nStates respectively, or to the people.”\r\n\r\nSECTION 1 of Article IV. of the Constitution says, “Full faith and\r\ncredit shall be given in each State to the public acts, records and\r\njudicial proceedings of every other State. And the Congress may by\r\ngeneral laws prescribe the manner in which such acts, &c., shall be\r\nproved, and the effect thereof.”\r\n\r\nSEC. 2.—“The citizens of each State shall be entitled to all privileges\r\nand immunities of citizens of the several States.”\r\n\r\nSEC. 8.—“That Congress shall have power to provide for the general\r\nwelfare of the United States,” which last is tantamount to saying, the\r\ngeneral welfare of the people as a whole.\r\n\r\nIt seems from these quotations, made in inverse order, that it was the\r\nintention of the framers of the Constitution, to make such provisions as\r\nwould permit and compel harmonious action throughout the States, but\r\nthat subsequently it became a part of party policy to maintain that the\r\nStates had rights reserved, and while not defining what these rights\r\nwere, to declare that such as were not distinctly and positively\r\ndelegated constituted this reservation.\r\n\r\nUnder this interpretation it is possible for serious difficulties to\r\narise between the general government and the States, as they have. It\r\nseems from the general tenor of the original Constitution that these\r\namendments are nugatory, because the inference to be drawn from them is\r\ninconsistent therewith. One of the most prominent, as well as the first\r\ndeclaration, is to the effect that nothing shall exist in any State\r\ninjurious to the general welfare of the whole. While it is within the\r\nscope of Congress to determine what is for or against the general\r\nwelfare of the whole, no State can set up its rights against such\r\njudgment. When it is further made the duty of the United States to\r\nguarantee a republican form of government to every State, and to protect\r\neach State in such against all others, there can be no limit set upon\r\nthe general powers of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe only fault, if fault it may be called, in the original Constitution,\r\nlies in this—that while the power to do is vested in the United States,\r\nit is not made an imperative duty to perform, though the duty is to be\r\ninferred by the vesture of the power. In failing to exercise this power\r\nin its fullest sense and to perform this inferred duty, lies the cause\r\nof all the disturbances within the limits of the country.\r\n\r\nWe can now proceed to the consideration of what duties Congress is\r\ninvested with the power to perform, which have not been exercised, and\r\nwhich, being exercised, would contribute to the general welfare of the\r\npeople, and thereby promote the public good. It will also be considered\r\nwhether there are any additional powers Congress should possess which\r\ncan be conferred, and which the Constitution neither directly nor\r\ninferentially vests. This consideration will proceed without regard\r\nbeing given to separating what comes within the limits already possessed\r\nfrom that which should be conferred.\r\n\r\nFirst in importance, because of general application, stand the common\r\nlaws of the country. Of these it is asserted, with the utmost directness\r\nand force, that when a general condition is to be provided for in the\r\ncountry, it should be the sphere of the government to make the same law\r\napplicable everywhere, so that the citizens of the United States shall,\r\nat all times and places within its limits, be subject to the same\r\ncontrolling and guiding rule. There should be no such possibility as an\r\nIndiana divorce under Indiana law, differing so much from those of other\r\nStates as not to be recognizable by them. There should be only United\r\nStates divorces, under a general law that could not be questioned\r\nanywhere, and by which the parties to it, should stand in the same\r\nrelations to each other, in whatever part of it they might chance to be,\r\nalso in such relations to every one, that they may remarry without\r\nbecoming liable to the charge of bigamy.\r\n\r\nWithin the last few years, many States have found it necessary to so\r\nreconstruct their general systems of law as to cut off all special\r\nlegislation. This course is eminently judicious in every respect it can\r\nbe viewed, and has proved excellent in practice, by relieving\r\nlegislation and procuring uniformity. If this is a desirable result, so\r\nfar as a State is concerned, why should not the application be made\r\ngeneral for the United States, with prospect of proportional benefit?\r\nAll people would then be subject to the same rule of action and\r\nresponsibility. To illustrate: A State has a general law under which\r\njoint stock and other companies can become incorporate. Before this,\r\neach proposed company was obliged to make direct application to the\r\nState government for an act of incorporation. After it, any proposed\r\norganization could become incorporated by conforming to the regulations\r\nprescribed, and thereby obtain all the power that could be conferred by\r\nthe Legislature direct.\r\n\r\nNo one having knowledge of the tedious processes of legislation will\r\nquestion the advantage of this general law, both as regards legislation\r\nand the people. This admitted, it must be further admitted, that the\r\nadvantage would be still greater, were this a general law of the United\r\nStates, applying in every State, instead of a mere State law, with the\r\nprobabilities that each State having it would provide different steps\r\nand regulations, so that a person familiar with that of one State, finds\r\nhe knows nothing of it in the State he removes to.\r\n\r\nThe same line of reasoning applies with more or less force to every\r\nbranch of legislation. Especially is it pointed regarding the Criminal\r\nCode, for here very great distinction exists in the several States. The\r\npenalty for a specified crime is scarcely the same in any two States;\r\nwhile some have abolished the taking of life for life, others still\r\nimprison for debt, which shows a degree of divergence entirely\r\nincompatible in a country that professes unity of purpose and practice.\r\nIn civil practice it is utterly impossible for the most studious and\r\nprofound jurist to acquire and retain accurate knowledge of it, in even\r\na small proportion of the States. Every lawyer can testify to the\r\ndifficulties he encounters at every turn when the laws of another State\r\nhave any bearing in the case he is engaged upon.\r\n\r\nSome States require that deeds executed in another State for property\r\nwithin itself, shall be acknowledged before a notary, while another\r\nrequires a commissioner of deeds; and still another the certificate of\r\nsome Court of Record that the notary is duly appointed, &c. The\r\ndifficulties that arise from this condition of things are of such\r\nmagnitude as scarcely to be conceived of by those who have never\r\nexperienced them; nor can they be adequately presented in the limited\r\nspace of this article. It is, however, held to be apparent, that if a\r\ngeneral bankrupt and election law is to be preferred to thirty-seven\r\ndifferent ones, general laws upon all other subjects are also\r\npreferable. It is a logical conclusion that the “public welfare” would\r\nbe promoted if Congress should pass general laws for the whole country,\r\nto cover all cases and causes that are general to the whole country,\r\nleaving for the States such legislation only as can have no application\r\noutside of their individual limits.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising that well instructed jurists of foreign countries\r\nhave no faith in our existence as a consolidated nation. They argue,\r\nthat it is impossible of a country containing so many internal sources\r\nof discord and differences. “A house divided against itself cannot\r\nstand” they hold to equally apply to nations. If this has stood thus\r\nlong and prospered, it by no means follows that it will always stand and\r\nprosper; but the inference is, that sectional interests will be the\r\nsource of continual disturbances and revolutions, until some great\r\nsectional interest shall become powerful enough to separate itself from\r\nthe rest of the country and to defy its power successfully. In view of\r\nthat consideration, should not the attention of Congress be called to\r\nthe fact that it is its inferred duty, at least, to enact all laws that\r\nwill promote the public welfare? And to this end it should inquire how\r\nthe public welfare is suffering from the neglect thus far practised,\r\nthat the remedy may be applied.\r\n\r\nIf it is found that its power under the Constitution to remedy such\r\nevils is doubtful, amendments granting it should be at once proposed and\r\nsubmitted. Whatever opposition there might be on the part of present\r\nState Legislatures and officials the people will welcome any measure\r\nlooking to the eradication of the cause of internal agitation. It cannot\r\nbe that patriotism is to pass away entirely, though it appears to be\r\nnearly submerged by the rising tide of individual selfishness. Let it\r\narouse itself and consider whether there be not room for exercise in the\r\ndirection indicated, and whether it is not better to prevent disaster\r\nthan to repair damages. The example of Louis Napoleon is an excellent\r\none to follow. Nor should patriotism be blinded by the mere name of\r\nfreedom and justice, sounded so loudly to cover the deformities\r\npractised under their shelter.\r\n\r\nIn many directions, this is eminently an analytic age. Let the fruits of\r\ngovernment be submitted to the crucible. Many of them would be found not\r\nonly hollow, but basely deceptive. It is well enough to cry peace when\r\nwar rages, but the crying will not bring it. It is well enough to laud\r\nthe freedom of the land, but why not make the direct inquiry to find how\r\nmuch of it is real, and how much is fancied freedom, not to say genuine\r\nslavery? It is well to assert that justice holds sway everywhere, but\r\nthose who have had most occasion to find it, must hold their peace lest\r\nthe fair delusion be dispelled. Let the peace that is cried, the freedom\r\nthat is lauded and the justice that is asserted, be subjected to the\r\ntest of analysis, that it may be really known what principles enter into\r\ntheir composition. It is much to be feared that when all the dross and\r\nforeign substances are separated, and the pure residuum only left, its\r\nproportion to the mass submitted would be lamentably small. Still let us\r\nhave the analysis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    LIMITS AND SPHERE OF GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\n          [Revised from the New York Herald of July 4, 1870.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIFTH PART OF MRS. WOODHULL’S DISQUISITION ON GOVERNMENT—INDIVIDUAL\r\n       ENTERPRISE AND ITS DEVELOPMENT AS AFFECTED BY GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\nIndividual enterprise, especially among Americans, has produced the most\r\nwonderful results. Very much of the advancement of the country is\r\ndirectly attributable to it. Great minds have been obliged to operate\r\nsingly and alone to develop their inspirations, ideas and conclusions.\r\nThousands possessed of comprehensive principles in a semi state of\r\napplication have sunk with them into obscurity for lack of appreciation\r\nand support. In the infancy of the republic, before it was possible for\r\nany to catch the idea of its grand destiny, it was not to be expected\r\nthat any great or general system of interdependence between the\r\ngovernment and the people should be adopted. There was a general fear of\r\neverything that did not seem to promote that individual freedom which\r\nseeks no harmony with the greatest freedom of the whole, while no regard\r\nwas paid to any philosophic relations of the individual to the whole\r\nnumber of individuals represented by the government. This was\r\nintellectual individuality, lacking the harmony of wisdom.\r\n\r\nIt came after a while that the great enterprises demanded by the rapidly\r\nincreasing growth of the country could not be conducted by single\r\nindividuals, and numbers of them combined to carry them out. Rapid means\r\nof transit began to be developed, which in many instances redounded to\r\nthe pecuniary benefit of the company prosecuting them, but always to the\r\ngeneral interest of the whole, both as a people and as a government. On\r\nthe contrary, many enterprises which have proved equally beneficial to\r\nthe country have ruined those who projected them. Thus the general\r\nwelfare has been promoted by the sacrifice of individual interests.\r\nEspecially has this been true of the great system of railroads that\r\nbinds the nation together with bonds of iron, too powerful, it seems,\r\nfor any sectional interest ever to sever.\r\n\r\nInternal improvements are eminently a legitimate branch of the general\r\ngovernment. They are not for the benefit of individuals or sections, but\r\nfor the benefit of the whole. So true is this that a seemingly purely\r\nlocal government cannot confine its benefits and uses to the section it\r\nis located in. Its influence permeates the very extremes of the country.\r\nA railroad connecting two cities in the same State may be built. At\r\nfirst glance this would be declared simply and only of benefit to the\r\nlocalities it passes through. But upon close scrutiny a variety of ways\r\ndevelop themselves that must be advantageous to thousands, residing in\r\nall parts of the country, and to the government itself. It therefore\r\nconduces to the public welfare and convenience in a much more general\r\nsense than to sectional or local good. It is therefore entitled to the\r\nprotection of the government, whose duty it is to look after and promote\r\nthe interests of the public. Is it entitled to anything more, or does\r\nthe full duty of the government begin and cease with simple protection?\r\n\r\nContinuous railroad connections exist between Maine and California,\r\nbetween Minnesota and Louisiana, which have been built by private\r\nenterprise, and are still maintained and conducted by combinations of\r\nprivate enterprise. These, with their connections, form a net work that\r\npenetrates every section of the whole country, all parts of which system\r\nare conducted as nearly as possible, considering the variety of\r\nmanagement, with regard to the harmonious working of the whole as a\r\ngeneral railroad system of the country. The representatives of the\r\nseveral roads meet and arrange terms of transfer and connection, first,\r\nto accommodate themselves; second, the public which patronizes them (be\r\nit especially remembered that the public welfare is always secondary);\r\nand thus it comes that that which is made the duty of the government to\r\nguard with jealous care is subserved to the interests of a company of\r\nincorporated individuals, whose profits, drained from the productive\r\ninterests of the country, amount in many instances to an enormous per\r\ncent per annum upon the original costs of the enterprises This is not\r\nthe greatest good to the greatest number. It is the greatest good to the\r\nsmallest number at the expense of the greater number. The public is\r\nhoodwinked into the toleration of their extortions by fictitious arrays\r\nof figures, and by the increase of the “watering” of their capital stock\r\nwhenever an eight per cent. dividend will not consume their unexpended\r\nbalances.\r\n\r\nAgain, there are railroads of great importance to the general public\r\nwhose earnings are not sufficient to make any returns to stockholders,\r\nscarcely sufficient to meet current expenses, and yet the public welfare\r\nwould not permit of their discontinuance.\r\n\r\nThe same line of policy that controls the postal service should be\r\npursued by government in regard to railroads. None now think of\r\nintrusting that very important department of the government to private\r\nenterprise. Is the transportation of the public itself of less vital and\r\ngeneral importance than its thoughts and wishes are, that it should be\r\nobliged to rely upon private enterprise to accomplish its welfare, and\r\nto obtain it be subject to its extortions? The custody of transportation\r\nof all kinds by government would insure regularity, harmonious\r\noperation, safety and dispatch, at minimum cost, to all whose pursuits,\r\ninterests or comfort, incline or compel them to its use. If the sphere\r\nof government is to be determined upon principle, and it is the true\r\nprinciple for the government to conduct the postal service, to the end\r\nthat the public welfare be subserved, then the same principle determines\r\nthat railroads and telegraphs should also be conducted by government to\r\nthe same end.\r\n\r\nThe time was, when it was necessary to the general good for the\r\ngovernment to guarantee protection and even assistance to enterprises\r\nthat should introduce these improvements into the country. The country\r\nneeded them. Government, not understanding its true relations to the\r\npeople, failed to provide them. Private enterprise, more sagacious and\r\nmore perceptive of the actual demands of the age, stepped forward, and,\r\ntaking advantage of governmental supineness, developed the true\r\ngreatness of the country. The time has now come, and the government is\r\nin position and understanding, to not only guarantee all needed internal\r\nimprovements to the public, but also to take charge of those already\r\nexisting, and to conduct them in the interests of the people.\r\n\r\nThese improvements are not patents that should forever remain hereditary\r\ncharges upon the industry of the country. They are granted privileges,\r\nmade by the government to promote the public welfare, and not for the\r\ncontinuous private gain of wealth and power. Let a limitation be put\r\nupon these patented privileges, so that the public good may be still\r\nfurther promoted. Let government purchase what are already in operation\r\nand construct others, as demanded, and conduct them all under one grand\r\nsystem, to subserve the interests, necessities and comforts of the\r\npeople, which it is its duty to provide for, even if in exceptional\r\ninstances it be at the expense of the public, as in some instances it is\r\nin sparsely populated districts regarding the postal service. Let the\r\nsame rule of action that governs this service be applied to telegraphs,\r\nrailroads and all improvements that are public in their character. Let\r\nthe present owners and conductors of them become the servants of the\r\ngovernment and the people, instead of remaining, as now, their masters,\r\nthus forcing them, by the only possible way, to comply with the\r\ninterests and demands of the general welfare.\r\n\r\nBesides, these gradually consolidating interests are becoming too\r\npowerful and selfish to longer allow of the government or the people\r\nregarding them with indifference. Even now they control a deal of\r\nlegislation by the power they possess. Unless soon dispossessed of the\r\nmeans of increasing their power and influence, they will become greater\r\nthan the government, and even dangerous to liberty. The national banks\r\nare powerful enough to feel they can dictate to Congress. What might not\r\na grand consolidation of railroads, representing thousands of millions\r\nof dollars, be able to do, if left to present tendencies? This is a\r\nmatter of most serious import, which is tending to a despotism more\r\nintolerable than that exercised by any of the monarchies of the Old\r\nWorld—the despotism of capital over labor.\r\n\r\nThis despotism is making the productive interests of the country utterly\r\nsubservient to the power they have created, fostered and protected,\r\nwhich should forever remain their servant instead. These improvements\r\nare demanded by all the growing interests of the country that express\r\nthemselves through commerce between the several States, and it is the\r\nduty of Congress to “regulate” them. It has the power. The remedy is\r\nrequired. Let it be applied, and at once, so that the greatest and most\r\nbeneficial of all the many systems of internal improvements any country\r\npossesses, both for the country as a whole, and to the comforts of the\r\npeople as individuals, may be conducted and extended in accordance with\r\nthe interests and demands of the public welfare. Nor should there be any\r\noutcry raised against the purchase and control of railroads by\r\ngovernment, as an unwarrantable interference with private rights. There\r\nare no such things as private rights when the public good stands in\r\nquestion. If the public good demands a new street through the most\r\ndensely populated part of the city, the property of private citizens is\r\ncondemned to its use, and damages assessed, from which the individual\r\nhas no appeal. The same rule must apply to all property that the public\r\ndemands for the promotion of its interests, telegraphs and railroads not\r\nexcepted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    LIMITS AND SPHERE OF GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\n          [Revised from the New York Herald of July 11, 1870.]\r\n\r\n\r\n    MRS. VICTORIA C. WOODHULL’S CONCLUDING CHAPTER ON THE SCIENCE OF\r\n                               GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\n  [The following is the concluding chapter of the essay on government,\r\n  its aims, sphere and tendencies, by Mrs. Woodhull, the female\r\n  candidate for the Presidency:]\r\n\r\nThere are no circumstances existing within the range of government which\r\nare deleterious to the conditions among which they are found that do not\r\ncome within the sphere of its control. If it were attempted to enumerate\r\nall such conditions, a very large proportion existing would come in for\r\nmention. Special reference will be made to such only as are represented\r\nby crime, indigence, helplessness and perverseness. While government has\r\nits duty to perform regarding all these, in their relations to society\r\nin general and the public welfare, it must not be lost sight of that\r\nthey form a part of the general public, and, as such part, it has a duty\r\nto render even to them and to the relations they sustain as individuals\r\nto other individuals.\r\n\r\nThe criminal is not only the son and brother, but often the husband and\r\nfather. Though he may have, by some act, forfeited the guarantee of\r\nliberty government extends to the people, he has not thereby sundered\r\nfamily relations, responsibilities and duties. It is the duty of\r\ngovernment to foster these, while protecting public welfare by\r\npreventing the criminal from pursuing his course of individual freedom\r\nat the expense of the freedom or happiness of other individuals or the\r\npublic. In this view penitentiaries should not be what they are, but\r\nshould be changed into vast workshops, where the convicted may labor at\r\nsome not altogether distasteful employment, to the same end that he\r\nshould labor when free. The theory of punishing crime is not all that\r\nshould be taken into consideration regarding the criminal. As now\r\npracticed it is exceedingly doubtful whether the State does not do the\r\nindividual greater injustice than he has done the public. The State\r\nshould pursue such a course as is perfectly clear from injustice, such\r\nas can conscientiously be held as committing no crime against the\r\ncriminal. To render to him what and only what he has rendered another is\r\nmaintaining the old Mosaic rule of “an eye for an eye,” which in these\r\nlatter times should be obsolete. The world has risen from the condition\r\nof Mosaic times by the experience of thousands of years. Fear was the\r\nonly controlling power then. Should it be so now? Prevention is better\r\nthan remedy; besides, there is no such thing as remedy for crime already\r\ncommitted. The criminal can by no possible means—nor can the State—undo\r\nthe wrong. Reparation in most cases is impossible, but should be\r\nrendered, wherever possible. It becomes, then, the chief duty of the\r\nState to prevent the recurrence of wrong by putting such restraint upon\r\nthose who are inclined to it as will effectually prevent their\r\ninclinations finding expression.\r\n\r\nSupposing that all living persons who have ever committed any\r\ninfringement upon the rights, liberties or privileges of others of\r\nsufficient moment to warrant preventative means being applied were\r\nrestrained from mingling with the public, what would be the ratio of\r\ndecrease in crime? These persons have trespassed upon the public welfare\r\nand it must be protected from further trespass. It is the duty of the\r\nState to see this done. At the same time the means of prevention must be\r\nsuch as shall not encroach upon the culpable one’s rights further than\r\nsuch prevention actually requires. As a member of society he has\r\nforfeited to society, to a certain extent, the freedom of expressing his\r\nprivileges and rights as an individual, by the infringement upon the\r\nprivileges and rights of another individual, also a member of the same\r\nsociety; and for this, society is in duty bound to restrain him. It only\r\nrequires that the present universally adopted theory, that crime is\r\nagainst the people and not the individual suffering, be carried to its\r\nlegitimate sequences to teach the proper limitation to this restraint.\r\nHaving arrived at that, it remains for the State to concede every other\r\nindividual privilege to him.\r\n\r\nIt should be his right and privilege to labor and receive its full\r\nrecompense, to which the State should have no right, further than the\r\ncost of his maintenance. The profits should be given those dependent\r\nupon him, or should go toward reparation for the damages done by him. He\r\nshould have the privilege of amusement, should have access to a public\r\nlibrary and the daily news. His whole restraint should be made as nearly\r\nas possible analagous to the every-day life of a useful citizen. He\r\nshould no longer be the condemned criminal, but the member of society\r\nwhom the public welfare requires shall be restrained from following the\r\nfreedom his proclivities indicate.\r\n\r\nThere is another class of individuals who, either from circumstances\r\nbeyond their control, from indolence, from incapacity, from settled\r\nhabits or from perverseness, do not perform sufficient labor to maintain\r\nthemselves and families in a condition that renders them useful members\r\nof society. Society suffers more or less from all the different\r\nrepresentatives of this class. They must live, and society must, in some\r\nmanner, furnish the means to them of living. If it is not earned, it is\r\nbegged or stolen. There are those also who, being too honest to steal\r\nand too proud to beg, suffer untold privations. All who would cannot\r\nobtain remunerative occupation, or that which they are suited to\r\nperform. To all of these as members of society, as a part of the people,\r\ngovernment owes a duty. Society, of which they are a part, owes them the\r\nnecessities of life, even if it be compelled to force them to earn them.\r\nIt cannot be made the duty of individual members of society to look\r\nafter the amelioration of these conditions. It is a general condition\r\ngrowing out of the relations of all its members, and hence becomes a\r\ngovernmental function, not only so far as they, as a class, are\r\nconcerned, but also to protect individuals of other classes from being\r\nmade to bear the burdens of them, either by voluntary contributions or\r\nfrom the impositions of beggary and theft. Every one who has attained\r\nproper age, and is possessed of moderate health, is capable of\r\nperforming sufficient service to support him or herself, and by so doing\r\nis a useful member of society, because contributing to the sum total of\r\nits productions. If he cannot obtain employment, society should supply\r\nit to him. If he will not labor, society should compel him. If he cannot\r\nlabor, society should maintain him. Were this practice once instituted,\r\nthe dens of infamy and vice, the sink-holes of crime and disgrace, the\r\npest-houses of disease, and the crammed-to-suffocation attics and\r\ncellars of our large cities, would be emptied of their occupants, and\r\nthey be made useful, instead of, as now, iniquitous members of society.\r\nThey are a dead weight society has to carry. It is a duty society owes\r\nthem and itself to compel them to assist in maintaining its general\r\nprogress. The same principle that applies to the criminal should also\r\ninclude them. The general influence they exert upon society is even\r\nworse than that of the downright criminal—for where the criminal is one\r\nthey number thousands. If it is necessary for the interests of the\r\npeople that he who steals a hundred dollars should be restrained of his\r\nliberty—and it is the sphere of government to do it—how much more would\r\nit be for its interests to transpose these leeches upon the vitality of\r\nsociety into producing members of it? As a subject wherein the public\r\nwelfare suffers, it is strictly within the sphere of government. Other\r\ncitations of unprofitable members of society could be made, but\r\nsufficient has been alluded to to indicate the general limits and sphere\r\nof government when considered philosophically. The evidences of a\r\nperfect government must not be sought among the most powerful and useful\r\nmembers of society, but among the very lowest classes. A good government\r\ncan have no classes so low in the scale of development or use as to be\r\ndetrimental to its interests. And here is the test of governmental\r\nperfectability. If the United States, as a nation, occupies any superior\r\nor conspicuous position in prophecy which is to make it\r\nrepresentative—if it is the point around which consolidation into\r\nuniversal government is to begin, and from which control shall revolve\r\nuntil the world is its object—it becomes the imperative duty of our\r\nstatesmen and legislators to extend the sphere of government until its\r\nlimits are bounded by nothing that is detrimental to the general welfare\r\nof the people. Such government, and such only, can be enduring while\r\nbecoming universal.\r\n\r\n                                  VICTORIA C. WOODHULL, 44 Broad Street.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     THE PRINCIPLES OF GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 NO. I.\r\n\r\nGovernment being an organization of power, and power always presupposing\r\naction, motion, it becomes a matter of the gravest importance to a\r\npeople who are formulating a government that they should lay hold of the\r\nhighest sources from which action can spring—that is to say, as all\r\naction is the result of some prime motor power, to have action which\r\nwill proceed in perfect channels, producing harmonious motion, it is\r\nprimarily essential that the motor, or moving or controlling force,\r\nshall be of that character which in expression will move majestically\r\nyet sympathetically against all opposition, always having in view the\r\nfact that the presence of low forms of any development is detrimental to\r\nall higher forms with which they come in contact, either directly or\r\nthrough exerted influence.\r\n\r\nIt has previously been found that the deductions which are to be drawn\r\nfrom a complete analysis of all the tendencies which governments have\r\nexhibited during the historic age of the world, conform to the\r\npropositions of the highest form of religious conviction, which is, that\r\nGod being the common Father of humanity, that humanity must be a common\r\nbrotherhood. Consistent with this the tendencies of government are found\r\nto have ever been to one common form. If these propositions grow out of\r\nthe fact that the principle of unity is at all times operating to bring\r\nabout a perfect expression of itself, through humanity, the legitimate\r\ndeduction is, that the time will come when its ends will be\r\naccomplished, and that that time will be when humanity has risen into a\r\ncomplete recognition and acceptance of the fact that they are all\r\nchildren of one common parent.\r\n\r\nPrinciples never change. They constitute the basis of creation, the\r\nforms of which are constantly changing under the influence of the\r\napplication of the same power. The same force which caused the matter of\r\nwhich this planet is composed to first assume its orbital position and\r\nmotion, now causes the various parts of it to exhibit the almost\r\ninfinite variety of manifestation which is now presented. The same power\r\nthat was exhibited in the construction of the original rocks, is also\r\nexhibited in the construction of the sweetest, most fragile flower. The\r\nevidence of evolution—progress—being, that from the rocks the flower has\r\nbeen produced. Ascending to the animal kingdom, motion, the result of\r\npower applied to matter, was found manifesting itself in the simplest of\r\norganic forms. There, as in the previous periods, it continued its\r\nconstructive workings, until the perfect animal form, man, was evolved.\r\n\r\nIn the strictest examination which can be made into the power which\r\ncontrols, there can be nothing detected which would seem to, even\r\nindicate that there is anything outside of, and superior to the\r\ncontained life, to which to attribute the direction the form takes\r\nthrough which life is manifested. If this be so, the principles which\r\nunderlie the physical universe are but names for this inherent power,\r\nwhich cannot be attributed to any power less than the Source of all\r\npower. Manifested principles of action, then, which relate to matter,\r\nmay justly be considered as the perfect operation of divine law through\r\nthe physical universe.\r\n\r\nIt becomes resolved to this: that the power which is the compelling\r\nprinciple of all action is at all times the same, but that it manifests\r\ndifferent results, as the channels through which it operates are\r\ndifferent Thus, the motion of the atmosphere over the surface of the\r\nocean exhibits power by the waves it produces; while the same power\r\nproceeding to land bends the forests and the fields, verdure before it.\r\nThe tiller of the soil involuntarily recognizes this fact, when he\r\ndestroys all growths which exhaust the constructive power of the air and\r\nsoil except the particular one he desires to further or perfect. He\r\nknows that to concentrate all the power upon this one, he must\r\nconcentrate its expression in the form he wishes developed. If this\r\nprocess could be understood, it should be the ordinary rule in every\r\ndepartment of the universe. All the power there is, should be\r\nconcentrated into action through the most advanced, and consequently the\r\nmost perfect forms—perfect forms always being those which are adapted to\r\nthe highest uses.\r\n\r\nWherever this rule is generally applied by nature or man, the lower\r\nexisting forms disappear, and in due time the higher fill the places\r\nthey occupied. Thus, species of plants and animals are constantly\r\ndisappearing from the economy of the universe, while new and higher are\r\nas constantly appearing. And it is to be specially observed, that where\r\nthe new exists the old dies out. This law is also distinctly visible in\r\nthe development of the different races and types of the human, all of\r\nwhich a universal tendency prophesies will ultimately be merged into one\r\ngrand, all-comprehending race. The tendency to this condition was\r\ndistinctly traced in the Tendencies of Government, and was held to be\r\nthe basis for the conclusion, that, in its continuance, the condition\r\nnamed would be naturally and inevitably reached. It may be stated then,\r\nas a general rule, that the most certain method there can be to destroy\r\nthe bad—the old—and to inaugurate the reign of the good—the new—is to\r\nattend to introducing the good in the most rapid and best manner, which\r\nwill naturally live upon and sap the life from the old, which must\r\nnecessarily pass away.\r\n\r\nIf a new race of humans is introduced among a race which is not\r\npossessed of that capacity which makes it possible for it to develop or\r\nassimilate to the new, it will most certainly die out. Such races are\r\nfixed types of the human, and their characteristics can never be merged\r\namong the general characteristics of the future common race of humanity.\r\nThe North American Indians are good examples of this fixedness, and they\r\nwill soon cease to exist upon the face of the earth; while the Negro is\r\nan excellent representative of the capacity of evolution and also of\r\namalgamation. It is not to be lost sight of, that when the Anglo-Saxon\r\nand the Negro amalgamate, the direction the amalgamation takes is always\r\nfrom the black to the white, and never from the white to the black,\r\nwhich is positive evidence that the Negro will ultimately be entirely\r\nlost in the white races.\r\n\r\nA mighty lesson is also to be gathered from observing the constructive\r\nprocess of the several kingdoms of the earth, each one of which is built\r\nupon the preceding and leads to the succeeding. The vegetable kingdom\r\ncould not exist until the elements comprising the mineral had gone\r\nthrough their various processes of integration and destruction, by which\r\nvegetable life was made possible. The vegetable, taking up the process\r\ninherited from the mineral, began moving through the same cycle of\r\nadvancement by which the mineral had made it possible, and it gradually\r\nmerged into the animal; and so gradually that it can scarcely be decided\r\nwhether some forms of life belong to the latter or to the former. The\r\nevolution of the animal, having ultimated in the production of the\r\nhuman, it is not to be inferred that there is nothing beyond the animal\r\nkingdom which is the fruit thereof, as the vegetable was of the mineral\r\nand the animal was of the vegetable.\r\n\r\nAgain, the vegetable world feeds from the animal—the animal feeds from\r\nthe vegetable, which is the only source which furnishes living\r\nprotoplasmic food, upon which the animal can alone exist. Humanity takes\r\nthis protoplasmic dish either fresh from the vegetable or second-hand\r\nfrom the animal. It will thus be seen that everything which nature\r\naccomplishes serves specific purposes, and that when the supply is\r\nexhausted the demand ceases. If this principle is followed to its\r\nlegitimate end, it will close in the life of the whole animal kingdom\r\nbeing merged into humanity, which will then feed entirely from the fresh\r\nprotoplasmic dishes of the highly developed fruit of the vegetable\r\nkingdom.\r\n\r\nThese arguments are not pursued as a necessary part of the Principles of\r\nGovernment, but that the working of universal principles may be caught\r\nsight of and made use of in the endeavor which will be made to decide\r\nhow humanity can best assist the operations of these principles as\r\napplied in its own government. Nature being ever consistent in all her\r\nmovements in the several kingdoms, how shall “Mind” assist her in\r\naccordance with her own principles of operation, in establishing perfect\r\nchannels for her powers to produce the perfect fruit of the animal\r\nkingdom?\r\n\r\nIn the Tendencies of Government it was found that all movements in\r\ngovernment which have been made during the historic age of the world\r\nhave been in the direction of universal control, the persistence of\r\nwhich course leads to the conclusion that it will be attained when\r\ngovernment shall be based in those principles which, proceeding from a\r\ncommon centre, shall be sufficiently potent to control the entire\r\ncircumference of humanity. The limits and sphere for such a government\r\nto exercise its power in, was found to properly extend to all matters in\r\nwhich the common interests of the public are concerned as against\r\nassumed individual interests, which would in reality be to the “greatest\r\ngood of the greatest number.”\r\n\r\nAn exemplification of the natural working of a government founded and\r\nadministered according to strictest governmental justice may be seen in\r\nthe growth and in the maintenance of the life of the tree, which may be\r\nmade to represent the tree of humanity. The tree is a complete community\r\nwithin itself; all its branches and twigs, even to the extremest\r\ndistance, are dependent upon the same fountain for its controlling life\r\ncurrents that the parts nearer the base are. No single branch can\r\nmaintain its life independent of the rest. Each separate one must draw\r\nits proportion of supplies from the same source and return the stream to\r\nits fountain when its demands upon it are completed. This power,\r\nstarting from a common fountain, is delegated to the various branches\r\nfor still further and more general distribution; but no branch can set\r\nup a distributing process for itself in opposition to the general\r\nprocess. If the branches had the power to set up processes of their own,\r\nthe inevitable result would be inharmonies in the common order, which\r\nwould work ultimate injury to all parts connected with the main body.\r\nThus it is with a country. It must possess a common governmental\r\nfountain, and all divisions of it must be directly dependent upon the\r\ncommon fountain. No division can be permitted to set up special channels\r\nof administration for itself. Each must work in harmony with all others,\r\nand all be equally dependent and dutiful to the common head. In such and\r\nin only such can harmony prevail and life be continuous.\r\n\r\nHaving found, then, what the destiny of government must be, and having\r\ndetermined its proper limits and sphere for operation, it becomes still\r\nmore essential and necessary that the true mainsprings of governmental\r\npower shall be recognized, for without this, government would still\r\nlinger in its age of temporary resorts to get over the constantly\r\narising contingencies of the times. When this recognition takes place,\r\nlegislation will have accomplished its work, and the vast talent therein\r\nexpended can be turned into the channels of governmental art. It is to\r\nattract the mind to the operation of general principles in nature that\r\nwe have thus far dealt with the material universe. In advancing into the\r\nsubtler department of mind, it cannot be for a moment supposed that an\r\nentirely new arrangement of principles lies at its base, any more so\r\nthan that there should have been new rules of nature to introduce the\r\nanimal or the vegetable. Instead of this having been, it is perfectly\r\ndemonstrated that the same laws govern in each and all; that is to say,\r\nthat the same principles of government control them all. Bearing this in\r\nmind, we now proceed to the consideration of the operation of principles\r\nwherein the human mind comes to assist nature in its strife for\r\nperfection, itself joining in the race.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     THE PRINCIPLES OF GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                NO. II.\r\n\r\nIt was remarked previously that Nature is consistent in all her\r\noperations throughout her entire domain; to which may now be added that\r\nthe nearer the human approximates his rules and methods to those\r\nexhibited in the departments of Nature below him, the nearer will he\r\napproach to true rules and methods. Arbitrary and dogmatic formulas do\r\nnot belong to Nature in her free manifestations, nor can they be\r\nadministered in any of her combinations. In all the uses men may make of\r\nthe elements of matter, he must comply with the laws of their existence:\r\nhe cannot frame a law, and then command that Nature shall obey it.\r\n\r\nCertain quantities of certain elements will combine and form a compound;\r\nbut no other proportions of the same elements will combine to form the\r\nsame compound, and in many cases they will not combine at all, unless\r\ncertain fixed quantities are adhered to. Again, an effort may be made to\r\nunite two or more bodies, and they will be found to be incompatibles;\r\nthat is, incapable of being united, because each has a stronger\r\nself-affinity than for any property existing in either of the other\r\nbodies with which they are brought in contact; but to these two or more\r\nbodies another principle may be added, which will produce the effect of\r\nuniting the whole. It is this principle in nature by which its elements\r\ncombine and form all the various and diversified manifestations that are\r\nvisible everywhere. These forms are none of them absolutely independent:\r\nthey may, by their inherent power, attract other forms to themselves, or\r\nbe by others attracted; the more complex and distinctly individuated\r\nones being dependent upon those from which they spring for their\r\nexistence; thus, as was before stated, the animal world is absolutely\r\ndependent upon the vegetable world for the protoplasm it must make use\r\nof to replace that expended by the animal economy. No animal can take\r\nthe elements protoplasm is composed of and manufacture it; that process\r\nis alone the office of the vegetable world. And thus it is that a\r\ncomplete and infinite system of dependence exists from the lowest form\r\nof organic life to the highest; each is necessary to every other, while\r\nevery one fills a special individual position of its own, and this is\r\nbecause they are all bound together by the same controlling powers or\r\nprinciples of action.\r\n\r\nIt is readily seen that the principles referred to are the same that are\r\nexpressed by a common humanity, a universal brotherhood: one is a\r\nbrotherhood of the elements; the other is a brotherhood of the ultimates\r\nof elements, of which mind is a product. Each kingdom has its beginning\r\nand culmination, and by the observation of their evolution we must draw\r\nthe deductions as to what really governs that age of the world, and the\r\nspecial kingdom we find ourselves living in. The beginning of the\r\nmineral kingdom was when simple elements began to unite to form\r\ncompounds; which was when the cooling process had so far progressed as\r\nto allow of combination; this process of the uniting and dispersing of\r\nelements culminated in the production of the simplest vegetable life,\r\nand thus ushered in the vegetable kingdom. In this, again the same\r\nprocess of uniting and dispersing was gone through with that had\r\ncharacterized the mineral. It began as it did, and culminated as it did\r\nby producing the next higher, or the animal kingdom, the simplest form\r\nof which is a single unit of nucleated protoplasm. Upon this single unit\r\nthe animal kingdom began to be built. The same process of integration\r\nand disintegration continued through countless ages and until a form was\r\nproduced, which is the ultimate of form in the animal kingdom. This\r\nultimate, man, is the perfection of form that protoplasm can produce,\r\nand hence is the grand ultimate of the process of elemental combination\r\nfirst referred to. No other or higher form is possible to be arranged\r\nfrom the elements that the earth is composed of. Therefore, all future\r\nadvancement to perfection must be in the perfecting process in man, and\r\ntherefore it is logical to conclude that the same law that governed the\r\nbeginning, the evolution and the ultimation of each of the kingdoms that\r\nproduced man, will also govern the beginning, the evolution and the\r\nultimation of the different stages in the perfecting process in him; and\r\nnot only in the perfecting process as a whole, but in each division of\r\nthe perfecting process; and this brings us to that part of the process\r\nillustrated by government, and to the principles of government which are\r\nunder consideration.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that there is a perfect analogy in the process of\r\nevolution that is observed below man, and in that which comes of man.\r\nFirst, there was the elementary unit, which corresponds to what was the\r\ngovernmental unit—the family government. Next, and second, there was the\r\nvegetable division, which corresponds to the second order of\r\ngovernment—the consolidation of families into tribes. Third, there was\r\nthe animal division of the process, which corresponds to the\r\namalgamation of tribes into nations. Fourth, there was man, the ultimate\r\nof the whole process, containing in him the elementary principles\r\nrepresented by all the preceding forms—in none of which were they all\r\nrepresented as they are represented in him—and he corresponds to the\r\nultimate of the process of governmental evolution, the complete\r\nconsolidation of nations into one grand nation, as man is the complete\r\nconsolidation of all animal forms in one grand animal form. His form is\r\nthe animal form, containing all animal forms. A universal government\r\nwould be a national form, containing the form of all nations gathered\r\ninto one grand form. Here it is that the analogy is complete, and Nature\r\nis consistent in all her parts and processes, at all times and in all\r\nforms observing the simple general principles which so unerringly lead\r\nher.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, one important addition to the processes in which man\r\ntakes part, over those where principles apply only in the so-called\r\nmaterial control. Below man there is nature only. After man there is art\r\nadded to nature; and it is this power to administer to Nature’s\r\nprocesses, to assist in them, and to remove and replace obstacles to\r\nactivity in higher channels, that distinguishes man from all previous\r\nformations, and which virtually makes him an assistant in the after and\r\nhigher evolutions of mind, which have, until very recently, been\r\ngenerally considered not of material origin, but which science now\r\ndemonstrates are purely physical results—are combinations in\r\nconsciousness of consecutive manifestations of matter. Here we have the\r\nultimate production of the ultimate of the animal kingdom, the mental\r\nkingdom, or the kingdom of ideas.\r\n\r\nScience also demonstrates that ideas evolve after the same formula which\r\nall preceding processes observed, and that all new discoveries of ideas\r\nare not discoveries of existing facts, but that they are new truths\r\nevolved from preceding forms of truth; or, in other words, that they are\r\nhigher forms of truth.\r\n\r\nThese relations are thus specifically stated, because in them is found\r\nthe authority for man to make use of all things which exist, that by\r\nsuch use, higher purposes may be subserved and better general conditions\r\nobtained. As the gardener destroys all weeds and foreign growths about\r\nthe vegetables he would produce, so must the gardener in ideas pull up,\r\neradicate or destroy, all false or decaying ideas which sap the vitality\r\nfrom those he would have flourish; and this authority is the same—the\r\nauthority of the higher over the lower, to the extent of individual\r\nfreedom and within the limits of the general good.\r\n\r\nSuch is the province of art, and man, in whatever department of nature\r\nhe operates, is the artist, adding to her beauties, which she can\r\nproduce by her laws, those which the evolution of higher ideas proposes.\r\nThus art utilizes and beautifies all that nature produces. Nature alone\r\ncould never produce a Central Park, nor the perfection in fruits and\r\nflowers that is now presented to please the taste and gladden the eye.\r\nNo one will question the right of man to make from nature the most of\r\nbeauty it is capable of, nor to make it most conducive to all his\r\nnatural desires. And here is found the basis for the authority from\r\nwhich it is analogically argued, that man has the right to practice as\r\nan artist in ideas. The position this artist in ideas should be assigned\r\nshould be as much higher in the scale of importance as ideas are higher\r\nthan crude matter.\r\n\r\nGovernment being the most formidable director of ideas and the most\r\npowerful opponent of their diffusion, if they are not in channels it can\r\noperate through, its perfectability according to the highest existing\r\nideas is a matter of the most fearful importance. It is for this reason\r\nthat so great importance attaches to the diffusion among the people of\r\nknowledge of the principles government should be constructed upon that\r\nits administration may be productive of the greatest individual, and the\r\ngreatest public good, which it is possible to obtain from the\r\napplication of the highest evolved ideas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     THE PRINCIPLES OF GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                NO. III\r\n\r\nIt has been the intention to show the importance of unity of purpose in\r\ngovernment, and that such unity of purpose can only be obtained by the\r\napplication to administration of those principles which in operation\r\nproduce unity in the kingdoms below the kingdom of ideas. Human\r\ngovernment differs from all other kinds of government in this, that it\r\nis for the control of Mind instead of Matter. The natural direction the\r\nindividual would pursue results not only from causes which arise in his\r\nmaterial nature, but to these are superadded those which pertain to the\r\nMental in contradistinction to Matter. Each individual is not only an\r\nepitome of all previous material forms which have been evolved, but he\r\nis also the finite representative of the Infinite Power which caused all\r\nthose evolutions, and therefore has an individualized, determining power\r\nof his own to the extent that he represents the Infinite; and as this\r\nextent differs in degree so extensively among the total of individuals\r\nover whom government presides, it is the most difficult of all tasks to\r\nprescribe forms for it to operate through, by which it can reach and\r\ncontrol this diversity.\r\n\r\nThis most serious difficulty which arises at every step in the search\r\nfor the true source of government, comes from the innate sentiment of\r\nfreedom in man, which is the truthful expression of the characteristics\r\nof the Infinite, which are indigenous, so to speak, to his nature. He\r\ninvoluntarily resists all attempts to exercise authority over him\r\nbecause of these sentiments. He feels, he realizes, that no individual,\r\nnor any number of individuals, has any authority from any competent\r\nauthority to exercise supreme control over him; and thus it is that all\r\nindividuals resist control.\r\n\r\nJust at the point arrived at comes in the other part of the fact, which\r\nbeing considered, modifies the absoluteness of individuality. Every\r\nindividual must either ever remember, or be compelled to remember, that\r\nhe is but one of millions of individuals who live upon the face of the\r\nearth, each one of whom feels the same innate sentiment of self-right;\r\nand thus it comes that there should be no restraint at all over each\r\nindividual exercising all his selfish ideas of rights strictly within\r\nhis individual sphere; and that all these should be compelled to\r\nharmonize so that none may interfere with others. Even to this last\r\nproposition there are natural modifications to be inferred from\r\neverything below man. The higher order has the authority of its position\r\nin the natural scale of evolution, over all that precedes it; and this\r\nauthority is of that absolute character which receives the sanction of\r\nnature in all the kingdoms which man can view.\r\n\r\nThe higher orders of ideas and thoughts should thus be the controlling\r\npower among men. They should assume the business of the artist in ideas,\r\nand prune, dig and destroy, if possible, all lower ideas which, live but\r\nto sap the vitality from the more advanced. The best expression, then,\r\nwhich it is possible for principles to find in the individualized\r\nproductions of the highest animal form, must be sought in the most\r\nhighly developed mentality; or in that mentality which expresses the\r\nmost of the Infinite, and which is consequently the highest authority\r\nrepresented through humanity.\r\n\r\nMentality represents the most important department of the duality which\r\nconstitutes the source of governmental power; but this, acting alone,\r\nwould not prove the perfect principle. It would pursue its aims with no\r\nregard to sentiment or feeling. It would ruthlessly destroy all\r\nimperfections which debarred it from having absolute control, instead of\r\nendeavoring to consolidate their life with the higher and the better\r\nbecause it is the higher. To this active, sternly analytic principle,\r\nmust be added the principle of unity or the affectional, which seeks to\r\ncombine all mentality in one harmony. The head and the heart should act\r\nin concert; the head perceiving that the same general principles should\r\nbe used to direct the forms of every department of life, and endeavoring\r\nto apply them to control humanity, should head the appeals of the heart,\r\nwhich, from its mainsprings of love and tenderness, feels, that the\r\nwhole universe is bound together by the indissoluble ties of fraternity,\r\nand, therefore, should realize that as a father and mother, they should\r\ngovern their children. Of these principles, government should be the\r\ntrue exponent, representative and administrator.\r\n\r\nBut here the question arises: How shall such government be inaugurated?\r\nHow shall those who are the best representatives of advanced ideas and\r\nthe broadest fraternal feeling become installed as the administrators of\r\ngovernment? Every thinking person knows that no such persons or\r\nprinciples are in authority now, and that they have not been these many\r\nyears. In the early days of the republic, which was constructed by men\r\nwhose souls were imbued with these principles—or at least the fraternal\r\nprinciple—it may be fair to admit that something nearly assimilating to\r\nthe true kind of government did exist. A government founded in the\r\nprinciples ours was could not have been organized except by men of the\r\nvery highest order of development in the true principles of government.\r\nThey were hundreds of years in advance of the general people, for whom\r\nthey wrought, and it may be seriously questioned whether they have had\r\nany representatives since, and whether they have any at present, who are\r\nactuated by any such lofty patriotism as they were. So long as they\r\nlived it was but natural that the people should have continued them at\r\nthe head of what they had constructed, by the means they prepared for\r\nthe expression of their right of self-government. It is well\r\ndemonstrated that these men fully realized the principles of freedom,\r\nequality and justice, which realization comes from the conspicuous\r\ndevelopment of the paternal and affectional elements. Mentality, it is\r\nplain, was not so conspicuously developed, for they did not comprehend\r\nthat the time would come in which those who should fill their places\r\nshould be almost infinitely lower in the scale of true governmental\r\nprinciples than they were, or that the controlling motives of such could\r\never descend from their lofty stand to grovel in the purely selfish. But\r\nthe time has come and now is, in the which the present places the\r\nfathers of the republic occupied are filled by those who are not in any\r\nsense the representatives of the true principles of government. It is\r\nquite true that the people are responsible for the men they select to\r\nrepresent them, but that does not better the very bad fact that the\r\npeople are not represented, any more than that the true principles of\r\ngovernment are. When this fact is seriously considered, it becomes\r\napparent that there is a difficulty somewhere in the processes of\r\ngovernment which has such imperfections that the ends of government as\r\nunderstood by its founders are utterly defeated. The result of this\r\nimperfection is, that instead of the true and best representative men of\r\nthe country—those whom the previous analysis points out as possessed of\r\nthe qualities demanded in government—being chosen to perform the\r\nfunction for which they are adapted, they are left one side, while\r\nothers without ideas are sent where they should go. In short, the whole\r\ngovernmental operations have been and are being prostituted to the\r\nselfish ambitions of party leaders, who do not care a whit what means\r\nare used so that they win thereby. This shows not only that there are\r\nimperfections in the organization, but that there is much which is\r\nradically wrong. It is even now being more than whispered around that\r\nthere is a plot being matured by which some of those who are now in\r\npower intend to continue themselves in power, even if they are obliged\r\nto seize upon the government in spite of the people. Such a plot could\r\nonly bring destruction upon the actors; but that such a disgraceful\r\nthing could occur, or even be conceived, proves that a remedy is needed\r\nsomewhere, which shall prevent such persons acquiring the power they\r\nwould thus prostitute to their own purposes, at the expense of the\r\nsacrifice of the rights of the people.\r\n\r\nThis government is either a government for the people or for the office\r\nholders; latter practices incline outside observers to the opinion that\r\nit is the people’s only in theory. If we examine the theory, it looks\r\nfinely enough; but when the manner it is outwrought comes under\r\nobservance, nothing can be found which entitles it to the name of the\r\npeople’s government. It is not the people’s government by a very great\r\ndeal; nor is it a government for one-half the people even; neither is it\r\na government which guarantees equality to its citizens; every count\r\nwhich can be made is against it, as the exponent of principles upon\r\nwhich it professes to stand.\r\n\r\nIn the first instance, one-half of the people are debarred from all\r\npolitical rights whatever, and they are those who form the producing\r\npart of humanity, and whose interests in government are in every way\r\nequal to that of those who exercise all the political power. Thus at the\r\nvery outset we find a professed equal government proscribing one-half\r\nthe people over whom its authority is exercised; and, be it ever\r\nremembered, is fully maintained. While they are made responsible for all\r\ninfringement of law, they have no voice in determining what that law\r\nshall be. While they are compelled to assist equally with the preferred\r\nclass to maintain and support government by the payment of taxes,\r\nrevenues, &c., they have no power to control the use that shall be made\r\nof them. This proscribed class, though living in the United States of\r\nAmerica, a so-called Republic, are in no better condition and stand in\r\nno superior relation to the government they are compelled to give\r\nadhesion, respect and support to, than are those of the most absolute\r\nmonarchy upon the face of the earth. What think you, enslaved people, of\r\nthe great, the free, the exalted government of a country which professes\r\nso much and grants you nothing?\r\n\r\nIn the next instance, it is not the government of the one-half of the\r\npeople it has really the semblance of being, and which many think it is.\r\nTo completely establish this significant fact, the attention of the\r\npeople is called to the immense minorities in the several States, and\r\nthe relations which they sustain to a Presidential election, wherein the\r\nsum total of all the citizens of all the States who are permitted to\r\ncast their ballots, and who do so cast their ballots, for the electors\r\nwho vote for the defeated candidate, exceed the sum total of all the\r\ncitizens of all the States who are permitted to cast their ballots and\r\nwho do so cast their ballots for the electors who vote for and elect\r\ntheir candidate. Such results have obtained; but a President thus\r\nelected is elected by the votes of the minority of the citizens of the\r\nUnited States who are permitted to vote, and consequently, within the\r\nUnion as a whole, a person may occupy the Presidential chair against the\r\nwill of the majority of the voting citizens of all the States. Such is\r\nthe perfection of the forms which have been framed and used through\r\nwhich to obtain popular self-government; and such the results obtained.\r\n\r\nThe same line of argument applies with equal directness and force to the\r\ncitizens of each State in relation to their entire State government,\r\nwith the exception of such officers as are elected upon the ticket with\r\nthe Governor; their representation in the lower House of Congress, and\r\nin their Legislatures and through their Legislators and their\r\nrepresentation in the Senate of the United States may be, and often is,\r\nthat of the minority of the voting citizens of the State. The same is\r\nalso true of all incorporated cities outside of their general officers.\r\n\r\nThis condition of affairs shows that there are two conflicting\r\nprinciples ever operating against each other, and that their very worst\r\nfeatures appear when their object is the “first office in the gift of\r\nthe people,” which, above all others, should be filled by the choice of\r\nthe majority of all the citizens of all the States.\r\n\r\nScarcely less in importance, as compared with the Chief Magistracy of\r\nthe Union, is the importance of Congressional legislation, which should\r\nbe determined by Representatives and Senators who should represent the\r\nmajority of all the voting citizens of all the States. This government\r\nwill always stand in danger of being overthrown by the unrepresented\r\nmajority, so long as such forms of arriving at representation are\r\nallowed to determine these questions, which lie at the very basis of a\r\nrepublican form of government.\r\n\r\nThe whole difficulty which this question presents arises from the\r\nseeming stubbornness with which the people refuse to understand that the\r\ninterests of the people as a whole can only be promoted by promoting the\r\ninterests of each individual composing the whole. In this consideration\r\nthe Democratic doctrine of States rights, to which the Democrats adhere\r\neven yet with so much apparent stubbornness, is utterly subversive of\r\nthe first principles of unity and it may be emphatically stated that\r\nuntil enlightenment is obtained upon this point by the common ignorance\r\nof the country, there is no security from wars such as that from the\r\neffects of which we have not yet fully recovered. The same principle of\r\nStates rights, as compared with those of all the States, if a correct\r\nprinciple of self-government, should also be recognized as the proper\r\none to be acted upon in counties as against the State, and in cities as\r\nagainst counties and States, and in wards as against cities, and by\r\ncitizens as against the wards in which they reside, and by the several\r\npartners of firms as against the authority of the firm as a whole. It is\r\nthe only mischievous principle which is operating to destroy the\r\nRepublic which is prophetic of so much civilization and advancement to\r\nthe whole world.\r\n\r\nUnder the application of such principle a single government for all the\r\n“nations, kindred and tongues” of the earth would be utterly impossible\r\nand impracticable. Nothing but strife, contention and wars would follow\r\na government founded on such principles of individuality as do not and\r\nwill not recognize the superiority of the community as compared to the\r\nindividual members of it. Upon this principle brought down to\r\nindividuals, every individual would have the absolute right to act upon\r\nhis own self-interests, no matter how seriously such action might\r\ninterfere with others possessing the same right. The community would\r\nhave no right to compel any restraints upon the individual under this\r\nprinciple of rule. This principle applied everywhere would carry us back\r\nto pre-historic times, when every individual was his own supreme\r\nauthority, and maintained it at the risk of his life. This is the purest\r\nform of anarchy, and as such is laid down by all writers upon\r\npre-historic times.\r\n\r\nWhy do not the advocates of States rights contend for the application of\r\nthe same principle to its fullest extent, and thereby become consistent?\r\nWhy do they advocate any general government at all? The truth and the\r\nfacts of the case are, that such doctrines as recognize the rights of\r\nthe individual as superior to the rights of the community in which he\r\nresides, are subversive of the first principles of order. Suppose such\r\nprinciples governed the entire sidereal and solar systems, what chance\r\namong so many vast planets would our little earth have? _It is saved\r\nfrom destruction because there is a Prime Power which compels them all\r\ninto harmony of action and movement, whatever courses their individual\r\nproclivities would lead them to._ The application of this general\r\nsuperior controlling power in governmental affairs is the only method\r\nwhich can secure—because it will compel—harmony.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     THE PRINCIPLES OF GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                NO. IV.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all this, which has been said in opposition to the\r\ndoctrine of individual sovereignty as the true principle of government,\r\nit contains the germ of an ultimate truth, which will be realized when\r\nthe total of individuals forming the world’s community shall have become\r\nso advanced from the present low conditions to those of wisdom and love,\r\nas to make every individual involuntarily recognize the rights of every\r\nother individual. In other words, individual sovereignty will be the\r\nprinciple of government when that time shall come wherein there will be\r\nno necessity for government, because the people shall have grown into\r\nthe condition of a universal brotherhood. It is this innate sense of\r\nindividual right which is present in the consciousness of every\r\nindividual who has grown to know he is an individual, which makes this\r\nconstant conflict between ultimation and approximation. It is the\r\nexpression, politically, of the same principle which, religiously\r\nexpressed, makes it possible for the consciousness of the individual to\r\ncontain an undefinable knowledge of a Great First Cause, and at the same\r\ntime to feel that he is an individual agent. In other words, it is the\r\nold doctrine of free agency reproduced in the political world, which, if\r\nit is but considered a single moment with an unprejudiced mind, it must\r\nbe seen that there is no such thing as free agency; for every individual\r\nis dependent upon something, over which he has no control, every instant\r\nof his whole life, which something even produces the capacity which\r\ngives him the power to think he is free.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen, then, that the great general principles which govern\r\nthe entire universe, are recognized in the proposition that all people\r\nare born free and equal, and entitled to life, liberty and the pursuit\r\nof happiness, which are inalienable rights; but it fails to be\r\ncomprehended that the inalienable rights of freedom are limited by the\r\nother condition of equality, which makes every individual free within\r\nthe distinct sphere of his individuality, but not free within the sphere\r\nof other individuals. He has the inalienable right to life, liberty and\r\nthe pursuit of happiness, when it is not exercised at the expense of the\r\ninalienable rights of others in the same direction. These are the\r\ngoverning laws which the worlds obey, and which control the minutest\r\nparticles of matter. And these are the true “Principles of Government.”\r\n\r\nIt will be also seen that the forms by which the principles of our\r\ngovernment are administered are imperfect, and consequently that,\r\nhowever much we may reverence the Constitution of the United States, it\r\nrequires remodeling to enable the true principles of government to find\r\nexpression through it. The inconsistencies, also, of the rights of\r\nStates, as represented by the common government, must also be removed.\r\nThe State is either the source of governmental power or it must proceed\r\nfrom all the States, as combined in government. If the former, we are no\r\nmore to be respected as a Union than the numerous Italian and German\r\nStates were before the consolidation. The republic, under such\r\nconstruction, amounts to nothing more or less than a union for offensive\r\nand defensive purposes, _at the option_ of the several States, which is\r\nas purely a governmental force as could well be imagined. The\r\ninconsistency of this construction of the Constitution was fully shown\r\nin No. III. of the “Limits and Sphere of Government,” and need not be\r\nrepeated here; the subject has been pursued here, that the utter folly,\r\ninconsistency and impossibility of the recognition of individual rights,\r\nwhere such rights conflict with the community as a whole, might be the\r\nmore palpably apparent. Having considered the source of the\r\nimperfections which exist in the form of our government, what should\r\nlegitimately follow for consideration is, the remedy. In the first\r\nplace, the theory of States rights must be abandoned, and each State\r\nmust become a member of the Union by organizing under a common form, to\r\nbe prescribed by them all, or by the present required constitutional\r\nmajority of them all, to make an amendment to the Constitution valid.\r\nThe same rule should be applied as that which has come to be a\r\nrecognized necessity in States regarding incorporating companies. All\r\nthe States should be required to organize under a general State law,\r\nwhich should be clearly and concisely set forth in the Constitution,\r\nwhich should recognize the general government as the determining power,\r\nand not that it exists by the sufferance of the States, but that the\r\nStates exist as organic bodies, because they have complied with the\r\nrequirements of the Constitution, which was necessary to constitute them\r\nStates. In conformity with such acquired power, States should prescribe\r\nthe means by which cities can become incorporated. In this way, unity of\r\npurpose and harmony of interest can be secured from the individual up to\r\nthe total of individuals forming the nation.\r\n\r\nSuch a government would be a strong government indeed, but one in which\r\nits composing members of States and the composing members of individuals\r\nwould have the utmost extent of freedom that the interests of the whole\r\nwould admit. If this is not the end to be gained by government, then\r\ngovernment is a simple farce, and unworthy of being allowed to exist\r\nanywhere. From the earliest historic ages the world has constantly been\r\nextending to individuals through its forms of government, more and wider\r\nfreedom and greater privileges and immunities. This process will\r\ncontinue to spread, as the general people become more and better fitted\r\nto be the recipients and the appreciators of such extensions to them.\r\n\r\nThe individual has more rights and privileges to-day in the world than\r\nat any other previous time, but all individuals have not yet become such\r\nperfect laws to themselves that no formulated law is required to\r\nrestrain them from the infraction of others’ present rights, privileges\r\nand immunities. Until such time come, a strong central government is\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\nA strong central government does not necessarily mean anything\r\napproaching a monarchy. But it does mean a republic which will have the\r\nsupport of all its citizens as a central support, instead of each State\r\ncomprising the Union reserving to itself the right to differ from the\r\ncentral power. In such a government, the majority of the people would,\r\nat any time, have the right to elect new officers, as provided for, so\r\nthat the strong central power would not be in the individuals\r\nadministering the government, but in the organic law which constitutes\r\nthe several parts of the country a common government, which, while being\r\nthe strongest possible governmental form, it would, at the same time\r\nguarantee the greatest possible freedom, equality and justice to its\r\npeople which would be compatible with the common interests and the\r\ncommon good.\r\n\r\nLastly, such a central power of government is the only one to which\r\npeoples not already within the government could be admitted without\r\nendangering its existence. A new State desires to become associated with\r\nthe several States forming the present Union. Immediately she is\r\nadmitted, she has, under the present doctrine and practice, the right to\r\nwithdraw. She has been admitted by and with the consent of the required\r\nmajority of the States previously constituting the Union; therefore,\r\nlogically, she has not the right to withdraw without the same consent It\r\nrequired this consent added to her free and self-expressed desire to\r\nbecome a State; it should also require the same consent before she\r\nshould be allowed to withdraw from the Union.\r\n\r\nUnder a general rule for the admission of new States, and of allowing\r\naddition to the present limits of the Union, all that would be required\r\nwould be for the people of a certain limit to adopt the requirements of\r\nthe Constitution, and present themselves to Congress for admission.\r\nAggregation, according to this rule, could always proceed without ever\r\nendangering the safety of the general government, because a country once\r\nhaving become a part of the Union would be under the mighty constraint\r\nof the whole Union to properly and peacefully perform the functions of a\r\nState in the Union. This condition can be well illustrated, by supposing\r\nthat there was a confederation of all the European powers to preserve\r\npeace among themselves under certain defined agreements. If a single\r\npower violated any of those agreements, or attempted to make war upon\r\nits own account against another nation, a party to the agreement, all\r\nthe other contracting powers would be in honor bound to make the\r\ninterest of the nation against which proceedings were being had contrary\r\nto the common agreement their own. War, under such conditions, would be\r\npractically impossible. So would disunion, under the proposed system of\r\nconfederation.\r\n\r\nThe country which shall first adopt such a system will be the centre of\r\nthe future Universal Government of the world; and it is with this view\r\nin mind that these suggestions are offered to the people of the United\r\nStates of America, which country is, by the common order of the\r\nuniverse, appointed to be that centre, to the end that they shall see\r\nthe necessity of immediate action to perfect the organic laws of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      PAPERS ON LABOR AND CAPITAL\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 NO. I.\r\n\r\nIt is a mistaken notion that the interests of labor and capital are in\r\nany way antagonistic to each other. This fallacy has, however, taken\r\nsuch hold of the minds of the representatives of both these interests,\r\nthat it is engendering a spirit of bitterness which, it is to be feared,\r\nwill grow into as fierce a character as that against slavery did. It is\r\nalways hard to produce any argument that will convince this spirit If\r\nconvinced, the spirit of opposition will not be calmed, and obstinacy,\r\nassuming the place of all sentiment, compels the individual to remain\r\nrebellious.\r\n\r\nIt is most true that there could be no capital unless labor first\r\nexisted. This stamps labor as of the greater importance. Let a person be\r\ncast upon a fertile island, without pecuniary means, and he will live by\r\nlabor from its fertility; but let him fall upon an utterly barren and\r\nsterile land, and all the millions of a Rothschild would not insure his\r\nexistence. So it is everywhere, and under all circumstances, to a\r\ngreater or less extent. Labor can exist—though not flourish—without\r\ncapital; but capital cannot exist entirely divorced from labor. Being\r\ndependent upon it for primary existence, it must ever remain under a\r\ndirect analysis in the state of semi-importance.\r\n\r\nThe capitalist is the more unreasonable of the two in the position he\r\nassumes. He continues to apply all his energies to the acquisition of\r\nwealth, utterly regardless, in most cases, of any idea of justice to\r\nwhat has given it to him. The general practice is—and this is the true\r\ntest, for whatever is of general application must be governed by some\r\nunderlying principle of right—when capital requires any given thing done\r\nwhich it is obliged to apply to labor to accomplish, it must give\r\none-half interest in the venture to enlist its co-operation. This is\r\ntrue regarding nearly all speculative pursuits, and when there is an\r\nactual necessity for either to apply to the other for aid to carry out\r\nits desires, this rule of agreement always obtains. This forms one of\r\nthe most conclusive arguments by which to demonstrate the true relations\r\nof labor and capital, and should be made the basis of all co-operation.\r\n\r\nIt is not for the best interests of the wealthy to become still more so\r\nat the expense of poverty to those under them. On the contrary, it is\r\ntheir true interest to render fullest justice and strictest equality to\r\nthe demands of labor, to be determined by the principles that shall\r\npromote the most general good. It is the greatest mistake of the age—it\r\nhas been the greatest mistake of all ages—to suppose that individual\r\nbenefit must accrue from the acquisition of wealth at the expense or\r\nsacrifice of any general principle of justice. It is also a great\r\nmistake for labor to array itself in opposition to wealth, and to form\r\ncombinations to control it. It is too late in the ages for these kinds\r\nof arguments to convince. They can only end in producing still more\r\ninjustice and distance between the two interests, which distance will be\r\nfilled by rankling bitterness and contemptuous insinuation. An approach\r\nof the two interests is what is desired—an assimilation of them, so that\r\nthe same end shall be best for each.\r\n\r\nIt may be laid down as an unanswerable proposition that there can be no\r\ngeneral happiness, peace or comfort among a people so long as the\r\nprinciples society is built upon tend to promote unequal distributions\r\nof the products of labor; and this brings us to the consideration of the\r\nremedy. It is to reconstruct society upon such principles as shall tend\r\nto promote complete unity, harmony and equality among its various\r\nclasses. To accomplish this it should be the special aim of every one\r\npossessed of wisdom enough to comprehend a common logical proposition to\r\nendeavor to bring about this equality by diffusing the deductions of it,\r\nin all possible ways, among both classes. Let the various producing and\r\nexchanging classes exist as they do, but let their relations be governed\r\nby such rule of law as shall render them equal, both as to caste and to\r\nthe benefits to be derived from an equal interest in the common cause of\r\nthe brotherhood of mankind.\r\n\r\n NEW YORK. July 10, 1870.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      PAPERS ON LABOR AND CAPITAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                NO. II.\r\n\r\nThe strife that is being urged to create divergence between the\r\ninterests of these bases of society is purely the result of ignorance of\r\nthe first principles of constructive use on the part of their\r\nrepresentatives. Instead of an endeavor to demonstrate to the\r\nunderstanding of all, the true principles which underlie these\r\ninterests, which would effectually unite them, those who have selfish\r\npersonal ends in view seek to further them, by engendering a spirit of\r\nbitterness and a desire for strife. There are those who cherish the\r\nideas of aristocracy who have no wealth, on the one hand, and are too\r\nindolent to endeavor to attain their desires by active labor, on the\r\nother, who think to create some serious diversion, and upon it to ride\r\ninto place and power. This class of individuals are ever busy stirring\r\nthe coals of dissatisfaction into flames of rebellion, thinking thereby\r\nto become the acknowledged representatives of the labor interest. It is\r\ngenerally true that a cause supported by such means has no principles\r\nupon which to base its claims; but in this instance the most absolute\r\nand just principles are ignored, while cant and bombast usurp their\r\nproper sphere.\r\n\r\nIt is quite true that there is a growing tendency to centralize capital,\r\nand that consolidation of monetary interests is the rule; but the fault\r\nof this does not lie in capital or capitalists—it is farther back than\r\nit or they. It is in the people themselves, and in the fundamental\r\nprinciples upon which society is built, and those which the people allow\r\ngovernment to be administered upon. If the laws of a country permit the\r\ndoing of a certain thing, which it is for the interests of a certain few\r\nto do, and they chose to avail themselves of it, there are many to be\r\nfound in these times so much governed by the desire for the public\r\nwelfare as to take the advantage offered them by the people, for it\r\ncomes down to that at last. The labor class have it in their power to\r\nsend to Congress just those who shall fully represent their interests;\r\nbut they do not do this; most of them are found actively supporting\r\nthose whom Capital selects and holds up for their suffrages. The remedy\r\nlies with the people, and they must make use of it before they can ever\r\nexpect to see their rights adjusted.\r\n\r\nThere is, as was said above, no conflict between Capital and Labor. The\r\nconflict is among their representatives. On the contrary, there is an\r\nentire harmony of interests between them. The true interests of each are\r\nbest promoted by rendering justice, full and complete, to the other, and\r\nin the understanding of this lies the _only_ solution of the Labor\r\nQuestion. Strife may continue, war, even, may come of the strife, but\r\nfinally the settlement must be made upon the principles of justice,\r\nwhich underlie their relations. One comes from the existence of the\r\nother; this, when created, should ever acknowledge its paternity, and\r\nnever assert supremacy, nor be allowed to do so; to be so allowed shows\r\nthat defects exist in the fundamental principles of government, or in\r\nits application to existing things. These defects it should be the duty\r\nof those who prate with so much volubility to discover and proclaim, to\r\nthe end that they may be understood by the people. The people in turn\r\nshould send as their representatives to frame laws, such persons as\r\nshall make it their business to attend to their duties rather than those\r\nwho allow themselves to become immersed in the schemes of plotting\r\npoliticians who seek eternally to continue themselves in place and\r\npower, and who lose all sight of, or care for, their constituency, in\r\ntheir necessarily continuous efforts to secure that end. Such\r\nrepresentatives should be religiously ostracized by the common people,\r\nand none tolerated but such as understand the relations which the\r\ninterests they wish fostered bear to those they feel they are becoming\r\nsubjected to, and who will unflinchingly advocate them at all proper\r\ntimes and in all proper places. The durability of government rests upon\r\nthe entire harmony of all the interests it is framed to protect, and no\r\ncountry can ever become continuously prosperous that has within it the\r\nelements of discord; no country can endure for any length of time that\r\ndoes not seek to eradicate all causes of dissatisfaction, and to so\r\nadjust its interdependencies that they shall be mutual and just to each\r\nas individuals, and to all as the public.\r\n\r\n NEW YORK, July 20, 1870.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      PAPERS ON LABOR AND CAPITAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                NO. III.\r\n\r\nThe duty of the philanthropist is to point out the harmony of interests\r\nthat exists between the extremes of the different grades that society\r\nconsists of. There are a certain class of would-be reformers, who make\r\nit their business to stir up strife and contention between these grades,\r\nand thus to separate their interests, and to make it appear that they\r\nare antagonistic. The number of the latter class as compared with the\r\nformer, gives them a preponderant influence, which, added to the real\r\ngrievances existing, enables them to create considerable excitement and\r\nmuch imagined wrong, which has no foundation in fact.\r\n\r\nThe laboring classes, being occupied by their labor, do not devote much\r\ntime to the study of the circumstances that control their condition.\r\nThey see that other classes fatten from their productions, and without\r\nstopping to inquire why it is so, straightway conclude that they are the\r\nsubjects of an oppressive power which desires to completely wrest the\r\nresults of their labor from them, and to always keep them in the\r\ncondition of virtual vassalage. This conclusion rouses the spirit of\r\nindependence in the laborer, and he determines to redress his wrongs. He\r\nsets about forming combinations, having in view the control of wages and\r\nhours, not comprehending that the remedy lies deeper than these, or that\r\nthese would regulate themselves, could the true cause of the condition\r\nthey rebel against be reached and generally understood. While it is true\r\nthat capital can never enslave labor to a degree that can be considered\r\ncompulsory on the part of capital, and unnecessary on the part of labor,\r\nit is equally true that labor cannot compel capital to its commands.\r\nTherefore both these methods of cure should be abandoned, and preventive\r\nmeans be resorted to instead. And these it is our duty to point out.\r\n\r\nThe judicious architect, before pulling down the old structure, provides\r\nthe material to replace it; in other words, he substitutes the new for\r\nthe old, and in the process leaves no unnecessary interval in which the\r\nfostered interests shall be left to the vicissitudes of anarchy. It is\r\nevident from the rapidly spreading knowledge among the laboring classes,\r\nthat they will soon demand some modifications in the forms, and in the\r\nrelations they sustain through them to society. Before breaking down the\r\npresent organizations society exists in, by revolution, which would end\r\nin a period of anarchy, out of which better conditions _might_ grow, the\r\nbetter conditions should be first considered, prepared and determined\r\nupon, and, by being thoroughly understood, should be substituted for the\r\npresent by general consent, without society being compelled to pass\r\nthrough the anarchical period that succeeds all violent disruptions of\r\npresent forms, whether in government, religion or society.\r\n\r\nAs society is constructed at present, it must look to legislation to\r\nproduce forms and to enforce order through them, that society may\r\nobserve in their operations the better results to them. Society\r\nexpresses itself most powerfully through legislation. Public opinion is\r\na force capable of many things, but is powerless to redress grievances\r\nor to institute the new and better for the old and decayed, unless it is\r\ndirected by the formula of law. All the energies of labor reform, then,\r\nshould be directed to the main point, from which benefit to itself must\r\nspring. It should waste no time nor strength upon the minor issues, but\r\nconcentrate all upon the one strategic point. And when this\r\nconcentration is effected, it should not fritter away its strength by\r\ndealing with the contingencies of the present, or in small expedients,\r\nto enable us to dodge along, simply escaping shipwreck, to be again\r\nforced the next day, week or year, to the same expedients to escape\r\nsimilar shoals. Instead, it should direct all its capacities to\r\nsubstitute a new and better foundation, upon which a new and better\r\nsuperstructure of society can be reared. How shall such a work be begun?\r\n\r\nLegislation is the primary constructive point from which better\r\nconditions must emanate. The laboring classes, then, must see to it that\r\nthey are properly represented in legislation. Nor should they be\r\ndeceived into the support of any who, by bluster and tongue, loudly\r\nproclaim themselves the champions of labor, without the understanding of\r\nthe first principles that control the relations of labor to capital. Let\r\nit be set down, once for all time, that he who denounces capital as the\r\noppressor is not the representative labor should choose to right its\r\nwrongs. In every community there are some who think a great deal and say\r\nlittle; these, as a general thing, are the antipodes of those who say a\r\ngreat deal and think little. Though the last are usually found floating\r\nabout the surface of society, it is to the first, society must look for\r\nthat wisdom, judgment and executive ability that shall guide it to the\r\ndesired harbor.\r\n\r\nIt should be the first duty of the labor interest, in each State or\r\nnational district, to select and elect one from that class that has\r\ncalmly observed the workings of present systems, and who can show where\r\nthe cause of existing ills lies. It is to the philosopher, and not to\r\nthe politician, that the labor interest must turn its eyes, and though\r\nhe be not smooth of tongue and glib of speech, he will lay such a\r\nfoundation in law as will produce the conditions desired. Your present\r\nrepresentatives, State and national, have shown themselves incompetent\r\nto the task you demand of them. Leave them to seek their level, and turn\r\nyou to others, who will not lose sight of your interests in the\r\nallurements which place and power present. You cannot expect that those\r\nwho are not of you can appreciate your wants or understand your\r\nconditions. Choose from among yourselves and you will not go far astray.\r\nThere are, however, noble exceptions to this rule of decision. There are\r\nthose who were reared in wealth whose hearts sympathize with you, and\r\nwho feel quite as keenly as you do the injustice you suffer. In these\r\nyou will find your best advocates, but see to it that your suffrages are\r\nnever, once again, worse than withheld.\r\n\r\nYou are in the majority, and the fault is your own if you do not make\r\nuse of the power you possess. Nominate and elect your own men; if your\r\nfirst choice fails you, try again, and continue trying, until the right\r\nman for the position is found; and when found, while holding him\r\nstrictly accountable, give him your cordial support while he is true to\r\nyour interests. Most persons who occupy position now, feel compelled to\r\nyield principle to the demands of policy, in order to retain it. This\r\nmust be remedied. None are fit to hold position who will sacrifice one\r\niota of their conviction in order to retain it. Self-interest must be\r\nsurrendered to those whose power fills the place, and for the time being\r\nit must act as the representative of them and not as its own. It cannot\r\nbe too strongly insisted upon, nor too often repeated, that it is the\r\nfirst duty of the labor interest to look to it that our halls of\r\nlegislation are filled by those who understand the true and the\r\nharmonious relations of labor and capital.\r\n\r\n NEW YORK, July 27, 1870.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      PAPERS ON LABOR AND CAPITAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                NO. IV.\r\n\r\nIn our last the attempt was made to show how important the laborer\r\nshould consider the choice of representatives to be, and also what class\r\nof persons should be chosen. The task of making these selections cannot\r\nbe begun too soon. In every district in the Union the laborers should be\r\nmade alive to this question. Some who fully appreciate its importance\r\nshould take it upon themselves to begin the work; they should converse\r\nwith the few they come in contact with, and these, becoming interested,\r\nshould be induced to extend the agitation; and finally, all over the\r\ncountry, primary labor meetings would come to be held for the full and\r\ncomplete discussion of the whole subject.\r\n\r\nIt is the most complete evidence of supineness on the part of the\r\nlaboring classes that they are not now represented as they should be.\r\nBeing so vastly in the majority, every office should be filled by them.\r\nThe difficulty has been—and we fear will be—that while the laborer has\r\nbeen busy at his regular task, others have managed the incipient stages\r\nthat produce the candidates, in such a manner that the interests of the\r\nmajority have been entirely ignored. Finally, when the regular party\r\nticket is presented, the least objectionable one receives the support;\r\nand thus it comes that the real interests and wishes of the people are\r\nseldom represented, and as seldom is the elected candidate the real\r\nchoice of the people.\r\n\r\nUnless our laboring classes arouse themselves to the real importance of\r\nthis matter, and become willing to devote sufficient time to preparing\r\ntheir candidates, they should cease blaming others for results; for they\r\nnow complain of things they have it in their power to remedy, but which\r\nthey cannot expect others, whose interests seem to be at variance with\r\ntheirs, to correct for them. Those who declaim so loudly and profusely\r\nabout the wrongs labor suffers at the instance of capital, should be\r\nstrictly guarded against, lest they, unwittingly, become your leaders\r\nand advisers.\r\n\r\nThere are at all times numbers of persons standing waiting and ready to\r\nstep forward to take advantage of any favorable movement among the\r\npeople which seems to offer inducements. It matters not to them in what,\r\nor where the movement may originate; they have no principles to crush\r\nout or control in order that they may fall into the current. It is\r\nalmost impossible to escape the curse of these ever-ready tools. The\r\nsafest and surest remedy against them is to select those who have never\r\nmingled in politics, and who will come direct from the shop or the\r\nfield. It does not matter so much if they are not able advocates, if\r\nthey only understand the work to be done and are devoted and true. Let\r\nthis course be pursued a few years, and the enormous proportion of\r\nlawyer-legislators would be diminished by one-half. Many of these have\r\nno sympathies in common with you, most of them are, by all their\r\ncontrolling influences, drawn from the consideration even of your\r\ncondition. What does it matter to them if the few articles you must\r\npurchase to render yourselves and families comfortable, cost you ten,\r\ntwenty or fifty per cent. more than the actual cost of their production,\r\nif corporations for which they are attorneys become still more corpulent\r\nupon this that is indirectly filched from you! For, do you not know that\r\ncapital under such rule does not pay the taxes of the country, but that\r\nyour labor does? In this way, the common laborer, who should not be\r\ncompelled to pay any levy at all, is taxed on almost everything he eats,\r\ndrinks and wears, and thus labor is compelled not only to produce what\r\nmakes wealth possible, but also to sustain it after having produced it.\r\nThis is a vast inequality in favor of capital and against labor, and\r\nstill it is the laborer’s fault; and it lies just where we pointed, in\r\nthe selection of proper candidates as representatives, State and\r\nnational.\r\n\r\nThere are but a very few newspapers that do not _profess_ to be the\r\nadvocates of the rights of labor. Let them be called upon to take hold\r\nof this matter, and take hold of it at just that point where the remedy\r\nmust be applied. Let them lay before the people a plain exposition of\r\nthe matter, and certainly aim to make the people understand it. Let them\r\nurge the people to assemble and concert plans and devise means to carry\r\nthem out, and to warn them to no longer intrust the most vital parts of\r\nthe “necessary course” to the care of hereditary members of the caucus,\r\nwhom money buys or whisky controls. It has become proverbial that he who\r\nwould be elected to any important position must dispense both these\r\n“powers” with a lavish hand; and he who can do this the most profusely\r\nis pretty sure to “be elected.” You may rest perfectly assured that if\r\nhe spend ten thousand dollars to secure his election by your votes, he\r\nintends at least to double his venture during his official term. You\r\nshould know by this time that “the purity of the ballot box” is simply a\r\n“play upon words,” and that elections are but farces to approve what is\r\npreviously determined.\r\n\r\nThe people, then, must look on every side for treachery to their\r\ninterests and dishonesty of purpose, not forgetting that a large portion\r\nof the press that profess your interests so warmly, that you almost know\r\ntheir truth, are open to the influence of at least one of the\r\nabovementioned powers, and that to go counter to the _commands_ of those\r\nwho “back them” is to go to certain destruction. Nevertheless, demand of\r\nthe press a course that cannot be denominated hypocritical, and if it\r\ndoes not respond, withdraw your patronage, and give it where it will\r\ncontribute to your interests.\r\n\r\nThese introductory details cannot be dwelt upon too long nor insisted\r\nupon too earnestly. To begin a work right, is to have it half\r\naccomplished; and most powerfully does this apply in the matter of\r\ndetermining who shall be your representatives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      PAPERS ON LABOR AND CAPITAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 NO. V.\r\n\r\nOne of the great questions of the day, if not the greatest, is the true\r\nrelations that should exist between labor and capital. It is one fraught\r\nwith more direct benefit to a greater number of people than any other\r\nquestion has even the external appearance of being. The real merits of\r\nthe question are of much greater significance than is generally\r\nsupposed, even by those who raise it. The welfare and the individual\r\nrights of three-fourths of the people are at stake. The question assumes\r\nthis shape: Labor has, by its continuous efforts, produced a certain\r\namount of wealth, from the use of the materials nature presents, that\r\nhas not been required to support and sustain the general life of man. By\r\ncertain advantages, either of general policy or of individual acuteness,\r\ncertain individuals have accumulated more than their necessities\r\ndemanded they should expend, and this accumulation has become an added\r\npower to that possessed by the individual previously, which power\r\nendeavors to maintain itself partly at the expense of that which first\r\nproduced it, and to transfer just so much of the cost of its production\r\nfrom itself.\r\n\r\nThat such conditions can exist and really increase in power and\r\nimportance, so that they can virtually control legislation, gives\r\nevidence that principles are operative that do not promote the interests\r\nof the entire people. There must be a fault somewhere, which fault it is\r\nnecessary to discover and expose, and then remedy. Now, where does this\r\nfault really have beginning? It is in certain protections and guarantees\r\nthat law extends to individuals, which permit them to have an advantage\r\nover those with whom they sustain the relations of society. These laws\r\narise out of false conceptions of the principles of common equality and\r\neconomy, which pertain to man as a common fraternity. In legislation,\r\nwhich first allows and then fosters such departures, then, must the\r\npoint at which reform should begin be sought. Any attempt to teach the\r\ngeneral mind can have no practical effect, unless, finally, the result\r\nof the teachings express themselves through legislation. Legislation\r\npresupposes legislators, and to have the right kind of legislators\r\ninvolves the necessity of the laboring classes giving sufficient time\r\nand attention to the matter of nominations and elections to insure that\r\nthose who will represent their true interests shall be returned.\r\n\r\nAlthough the remedy for all the laborer’s ills must be sought through\r\nlegislation, there are, nevertheless, many fallacies still received,\r\neven by the laborer, that have the direct tendency to degrade labor and\r\nto elevate the position of capital. One of the principal of these is a\r\nfalse monetary basis, a false representative standard of values, which\r\nis arbitrarily imposed upon the people, with no positive and absolute\r\nvalue within itself, except that which such arbitrary law gives it.\r\nGold, as a standard of values, has been set up and worshiped so long,\r\nthat people submit to its decrees with about the same appreciation of\r\nits real merits that they have of the mysteries of religion, as\r\nexpounded by their paid oracles, who have constituted themselves into\r\nauthorities to declare, “Thus saith the Lord.” The people have\r\nsurrendered their reason in these matters to these self-constituted\r\nauthorities, and so have they surrendered common sense to the god of\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nAnother, and almost as important fallacy, is that of interfering with\r\nthe natural ebb and flow of the products of the world by imposing upon\r\ncertain of them such tribute as makes it pretty nearly impracticable for\r\nthem to find their way to the locality of natural demand, in order that\r\na special few who inhabit that locality may produce the same at a\r\ngreatly increased cost, which the consumer must pay in order to obtain.\r\nIt does not matter how this plain statement may be twisted and bent by\r\nthe alluring sophistries and glittering generalities of the\r\nprotectionist; a plain statement, viewed with clear light, needs no\r\nauthoritative sanction to determine its truth. If it be any benefit for\r\na thousand men to pay one man ten per cent more for a desired article,\r\nbecause it is of home production, than it could be purchased for from a\r\nforeign producer, we should be most happy to have it demonstrated. The\r\nargument used is, that by that one man being protected in its production\r\nhe is thereby enabled to give employment to a certain number of\r\nlaborers. But to make even this tenable upon their own statement, they\r\nmust at the same time prove that those laborers would not have been able\r\nto apply themselves to any other labor during the time required to\r\nproduce the article in question. This at once leads to such an intricacy\r\nof cause and effect that those who attempt to solve the mysticism prefer\r\nto accept the declaration that protection is a good thing rather than\r\nacknowledge that they are lost in the fog and obscurity they have been\r\nsent to explore to find the required evidence.\r\n\r\nAnother extensive popular fallacy is that of the continuation of special\r\nprotection to monopolies after their existence as monopolies is assured,\r\nwhich renders them perpetual taxes upon the labor that must make use of\r\nthem, and perpetual patents upon the industry of the country, by which a\r\nfew already plethoric capitalists become still more obese. The great\r\nsystems of internal improvements of the country belong to the country,\r\nand the country should so arrange their conduct that the people could\r\nmake use of them at the least possible expense of support.\r\n\r\nIt is these and sundry like matters that the laborers of the country\r\nshould require their representatives to understand and act upon, and\r\nthey should cast their vote for no one that will not, at all times and\r\nunder all circumstances, advocate and vote for the greatest good of the\r\ngreatest number. In this way, labor may hope to arise from its present\r\nposition of degradation to sit side by side with capital in all public\r\nand profitable positions and those of honor and trust.\r\n\r\n NEW YORK, August 10, 1870.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      PAPERS ON LABOR AND CAPITAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                NO. VI.\r\n\r\nFrom various sources we learn that there is beginning to be a manifest\r\ninterest in all the different States and Congressional districts\r\nregarding the next elections. The representatives of labor seem to begin\r\nto realize the great importance of special attention to all that belongs\r\nto primary organization, and to perceive that heretofore they have been\r\nobliged to throw their strength away or waste it in unprofitable\r\ndirections, from the very fact that they did not give the necessary\r\nattention to the first steps in the process of determining who should be\r\nset up for them to choose between. It does not seem possible that any\r\nshould be returned to office who entertain opinions antagonistic to the\r\ngeneral interests of labor. Three-fourths of the entire population of\r\nthe country are in this interest, and whether they be artisans in\r\nmechanics or nature—whether they be by the anvil or the plow—whether\r\nthey be printers or writers—their interests are all the same; it only\r\nrequires that they should all understand this to consolidate them into a\r\npower that would control every movement of government. Should this unity\r\nonce be found practical, and should it be recognized by capital as\r\nconsummated, its representatives would be compelled to come to those,\r\nwho now look to them, for the granting of ameliorating conditions. It is\r\nmost probable that when such a unity shall be attained both the\r\ncapitalist and the laborer will, for the first time, discover that\r\nwhatever really militates against the true interests of one, is equally\r\nantagonistic to the best interests of the other.\r\n\r\nSome who have thought this might be so, have endeavored to devise\r\nmethods by which harmonious action could be secured. Various schemes of\r\nco-operation have been suggested, many of them tried and found faulty\r\nand then discarded, until it has come to be pretty thoroughly understood\r\nthat there is no level upon which they can meet and part in mutuality of\r\ninterest. It is true that no perfect method can be suggested or\r\ninstituted that will from the first give complete results; but the\r\nprinciple must be sought that governs the relations between the separate\r\ninterests and applied, at first, with imperfect results, which must\r\nafterward be improved as the interests grow into a true comprehension of\r\neach other’s character.\r\n\r\nThe principle is this, that labor and capital are equally interested in\r\nthe productions that flow from their joint operations; that is, the\r\ncapital that gives employment to one hundred laborers is entitled to an\r\nequal interest with the laborers in what is produced. But here is an\r\ninequality to begin with. The capital may only represent one individual,\r\nwhile the laborers are one hundred; still, this is the relation, and the\r\nfinal result of its operation will be a complete equality in this wise:\r\nThe one hundred laborers perform their regular duties, receiving\r\ntherefor such regular wages as are proper; and also their respective\r\nproportions of the profits of their productions. In, say, five years,\r\nthese one hundred laborers will have accumulated a sufficient capital\r\nwith which to transact the business on their own account; and here is\r\nwhere a system of equality is reached, which again would be followed by\r\nanother degree of progress for the laborer. The capitalist, finding\r\nhimself left out of the count by the operation of this method, would\r\ncome forward and offer his capital to labor organizations at a\r\nreasonable rate of interest, and in this way a common interest would be\r\nthe only possible result. The entire profits of the labor would then be\r\ndivided among the producers, while the capitalist would have to be\r\nsatisfied with the moderate interest he would realize, in place of the\r\nextraordinary sums now sometimes acquired from the sweat and muscle of\r\nthe laborer. There is one point, however, in the first instance, that\r\nmodifies the inequality mentioned in a very material degree. The\r\ncapitalist, while enjoying as much profit as all the laborers, is also\r\nliable for all losses, in which the laborer has no interest.\r\n\r\nFollowing the results of the co-operation above mentioned would be\r\nvarious modifications in society and in the locality of populations.\r\nPeople engaged in the same pursuits would naturally gravitate to each\r\nother and into distinct localities, while the various interests they\r\nrepresented would gravitate to those localities that should offer the\r\nmost inducement to their respective trades. One of the results of this\r\nwould be that all raw material would, in all cases—where all the\r\nrequirements were present—be manufactured in the locality of its\r\nproduction, thereby saving vast amounts of transportation; and this\r\nagain would be illustrative of another department of general economy, in\r\nthe light of which protection to special manufacturing interests would\r\nbe seen in its true colors.\r\n\r\nWe have thus briefly endeavored to point out the practical results that\r\nwould flow from the adoption, generally, of the true principle of\r\nco-operation for the specific purpose of assisting the labor interest in\r\nselecting candidates for their representatives, both State and national.\r\nThey should be those who understand these relations, and what would\r\nnaturally follow them, and who would at all times, and under all\r\ncircumstances, advocate their adoption, and, in the first instance, such\r\npolicies as would most materially assist in their development, and lead\r\nto their introduction and practice on the part of all who compose both\r\ninterests. Labor is the basis upon which all society rests, and nothing\r\nis entitled to so much consideration at the hands of legislation.\r\nNothing heretofore has been so grossly neglected, insulted and imposed\r\nupon.\r\n\r\n NEW YORK, August 20, 1870\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      PAPERS ON LABOR AND CAPITAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                NO. VII.\r\n PRIORITY OF RIGHT—THEIR POSITION IN THE PROCESSES OF SOCIETY—THE EARTH\r\n BELONGS TO MAN AT LARGE—INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS, PURE ASSUMPTION—PRINCIPLES,\r\n                      PRACTICE, REMEDIES AND CURE.\r\n\r\nCapital, primarily, is the product of labor, but labor, in the abstract,\r\ncould produce nothing of itself. It must have something upon which to\r\napply itself. It cannot create anything; it can only alter, readjust or\r\nrearrange the materials which nature offers, and by bringing them into\r\nnew relations with each other make it possible for them to subserve\r\nother and better purposes than when, in the constitution assigned them\r\nby the operation of natural laws, they are unmodified by the touch of\r\nmind. Therefore, while capital is the direct result of labor, labor\r\nwould not be possible without the free gifts of nature. Absolute\r\noriginality, then, or absolute priority of right, as between labor and\r\ncapital, cannot be claimed by or for either.\r\n\r\nThe formula of the operation, beginning with nature and ending in the\r\nultimate use of its productions, in contributing to the happiness of the\r\nrace, is this: Nature is made up of the elements of the universe, which,\r\ncompounded into forms, are offered to man to be modified into other\r\nforms and to combine in new relations which may best contribute to the\r\nneeds of the human family. In this view, and in view of the inharmonious\r\nrelations that exist between capital and its co-equal labor, it becomes\r\nnecessary to give the whole matter a complete analysis, in order to\r\ndiscover, if possible, where the primary fault lies, and to find the\r\nproper solution of all differences.\r\n\r\nThe human race exists upon the earth. At a past period no human being\r\nexisted upon it. At a later day the human race arose. Before man,\r\nnothing claimed the ownership of any part of the earth’s surface. When\r\nman presented himself he began to make use of various parts of it for\r\nhis own ends, but to the land thus appropriated he acquired no permanent\r\ntitle or right of ownership. It was his to obtain from it all that his\r\ngenius and strength made possible. So much as he could thus extract he\r\ncould possess, but further than this his title was valueless.\r\n\r\nThe races of men that now inhabit the earth are scattered over the\r\ngreater part of its surface, drawing what it spontaneously yields and\r\nwhat they can force it to yield. From these premises it would seem\r\nunquestionable that each individual of the human family had an equal\r\nright to its benefits. The only difference that ought to exist should be\r\nthat limited and bounded by the capacity of each to produce. No person\r\ncould therefore ever acquire, under the rule of universal justice, an\r\nabsolute ownership to any part or portion of the earth’s surface. If the\r\nchain of title to any claimed ownership is followed backward\r\nsufficiently, it will be found to have originated in an assumption in\r\nthe first instance of ownership to something that belonged to men in\r\ncommon.\r\n\r\nWe can now acquire landed property from the government, and this creates\r\nthe most absolute ownership that can exist; but here again comes the\r\nquestion whether governments can do what is impossible to individuals?\r\nCan a system organized by a people perform acts not in the power of the\r\npeople themselves to perform? Can a government by the mere fact of\r\nhaving been organized to preserve harmony among a people acquire an\r\nabsolute title to the earth that is contained within its jurisdiction?\r\nIf an individual cannot go into an unclaimed territory and take absolute\r\npossession of a certain portion of it, then no number of persons, nor\r\ncan any government they may establish, do so. And here exists one cause\r\nof discord between labor which produces and capital which monopolizes.\r\n\r\nAll monopolies arise from landed monopolies. Were there no inequalities\r\nbetween men in claims to certain areas of the earth’s surface, no other\r\nmonopolies would find a basis for existence. Every individual should\r\nhave a right to the use of a certain quantity of the real estate of the\r\ncountry, and the right to all improvements he might make upon it. Here\r\nwould be a basis of equity which would forever prevent the accumulation\r\nin the hands of any few persons, of vast quantities of real estate,\r\nwhich is the real basis of all securities. It is such a basis because\r\neverything is produced from it. All manufacturers must rely upon it for\r\ntheir raw material, and, therefore, a practical equality in the\r\noccupation and use of the public domain would insure a certain degree of\r\nequality in all things that might spring from it. It was the perception\r\nof this principle that caused Lycurgus to divide the lands of Lacedemon\r\nequally among all the people; and a general recognition of it should now\r\ntake place.\r\n\r\nWhile these are the principles that underlie the workings of society,\r\nand which must be practiced before a general equality can exist, it is\r\nnot to be expected that they can be immediately introduced. There are\r\ntoo few who understand the real rights of man, and too many who do not\r\nwish to understand them. While this condition of ignorance and\r\nperverseness keeps the world inharmonious and subjected to suffering, we\r\nshould avail ourselves of all the alleviatory methods that can be\r\nsuggested in our present system. Between two evils choose the least; but\r\nin the pursuit of remedies, the root of the disease should never be lost\r\nsight of. Nor should the spirit that is exhibited in many so-called\r\nLabor and Workingmen’s Journals be encouraged. Strife and animosity will\r\nnever accomplish half so much as calmness, reason and persuasion. “Come,\r\nlet us reason together,” was never more judiciously proposed than it\r\ncould now be by capitalists and workingmen. The latter must remember\r\nthat they cannot compel capitalists to their terms, and capitalists must\r\nnot forget that if there are real causes of dissatisfaction growing out\r\nof injustice, the sooner justice is done the less serious will be the\r\nreckoning with the laborer. Instead of strife let us have co-operation;\r\ninstead of war let us have peace; instead of the process of fermentation\r\nlet us have that of mutual understanding.\r\n\r\n NEW YORK, August 27, 1870.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      PAPERS ON LABOR AND CAPITAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               NO. VIII.\r\n   THE CINCINNATI CONVENTION—NEW PARTIES AND NEW ISSUES—PEOPLE’S EYES\r\n OPEN—DETERMINATION TO TAKE MATTERS INTO THEIR OWN HANDS—WILL THEY MAKE\r\n  JUDICIOUS MOVEMENTS?—THE RIGHTS OF LABOR—SHALL THEY BE IGNORED?—OUR\r\n                 POSITION REGARDING THE LABOR MOVEMENT.\r\n\r\nThe National Labor Convention lately held in Cincinnati was called for\r\nthe special purpose of beginning an organization having in view the next\r\nPresidential canvass. It had taken the means of obtaining the views of a\r\nnumber of the most prominent public men, letters enunciating which views\r\nwere duly presented before the convention. That of Governor Geary, of\r\nPennsylvania, appears to have occupied the position of most prominency,\r\nand to have been regarded with peculiar and unanimous favor. The views\r\npresented by him are such as were sure to find favor with the\r\nrepresentatives of labor, and so far he stands A No. 1 as the\r\nprospective candidate for the Presidency of the National Labor party.\r\n\r\nIt has been very evident for the last year that the old parties had lost\r\ntheir power of inspiration over the people. The Democratic party sold\r\nitself out to slavery and virtually died when slavery died. A party may\r\nexist called Democratic, but it will be upon new issues and must take\r\nnew departures. The hard conservatism that attaches to it from its\r\nformer practices does not suit the spirit of the eighth decade of the\r\nnineteenth century. The rank and file that have so long blindly followed\r\nwherever their leaders commanded are becoming imbued with this spirit,\r\nand they begin to realize that they have been mere automatons that have\r\nbeen moved with no acquiescent will of their own. Newspapers have become\r\ntoo commonly read. That the blind should be led necessitates the\r\ncontinuous condition of blindness. So, too, with, the understanding.\r\nWhat have the masses known of the essence of the issues that have formed\r\nthe platform of the political parties for the last fifty years? When war\r\ncame, as the result of a blind course on the part of politicians, the\r\nmasses began to open their eyes to the fact that they had been\r\nunwittingly betrayed into a most dangerous and fearful condition,\r\nwherein it became necessary to cut each other’s throats. Since the close\r\nof the war they have not only kept their eyes open to the full extent\r\nthe war opened them, but they have also opened their understanding and\r\nfor the first time fully realize that they are indeed freemen; and to\r\nbecome conscious that heretofore they have been so only in name. Awaking\r\nas they have from the delusion so long hugged to their hearts, it will\r\nnot be strange if they do some inconsiderate and short-sighted things.\r\n\r\nIt is the duty of all who have the true interest of the whole people at\r\nheart to warn them of all the extremes they are likely to contend for,\r\nand to suggest permanent practical methods, which shall spring from\r\nprinciples that will apply at all times to all men—and women. The\r\nRepublican party being composed of somewhat different elements is\r\ndisintegrated from different action of the same causes; with the\r\ndestruction of slavery and the reconstruction of the country its\r\nstrength was expended. All people who were opposed to slavery had\r\nconcentrated in the Republican party, because of the similarity of\r\nsentiment upon this single question; this settled, they find themselves\r\nwithout a common rallying idea; they differ as widely upon the old and\r\ncommon topics among themselves as they differ from those who do not\r\nbelong to the party and never did. Place and power are the sole things\r\nthat hold the Republican party together at all; these gone it will be\r\ngone.\r\n\r\nIt is just at this time that new parties are demanded, and they are sure\r\nto arise. The conditions are all favorable. It remains for wise counsels\r\nto prevail in the formation and departure of these, to insure them\r\nsomething more than death with the accomplishment of one of their\r\ncentral ideas, which destiny fell to the lot of the Republican party.\r\nUnquestionably there will be a Labor party in the next canvass. We are\r\nsorry it is denominated the Labor party, because it should be something\r\nmore than a Labor party, and because this is a direct challenge to\r\ncapital, and it will very probably result in arraying these two\r\ninterests in an antagonism which will be but a repetition of the slavery\r\nantagonism. No party built upon a specific idea, looking in a single\r\ndirection, can ever attain to even the promise of permanency; and it is\r\nfor this reason we say we are sorry to see a party sectionalizing itself\r\nat the very outset of its attempting a general movement toward\r\norganization.\r\n\r\nIt seems, also, a little premature that an organization calling itself a\r\nLabor organization, should at the outset put itself upon the record\r\nagainst the freedom of labor, let it come from whence it may, and be of\r\nwhatever nature it may. This policy is short-sighted, and will prove a\r\nstumbling-block to the party, though for the time Chinese emigration may\r\nserve for a rallying-cry. All assertions that the Chinese emigrants can\r\nbe reduced to a system of slavery among us are humbuggery of the first\r\nwater. There is no law to prevent a person contracting with a hundred\r\nAmerican workmen at the best terms he can. It is quite certain there is\r\nno law to prevent him from employing Irishmen, Germans or even Chinese\r\nupon the same terms. And if it is done, and labor is thereby obtained\r\ncheaper than the citizens of this country desire to furnish it, the\r\nlaboring class must not lay the charge to the capitalist who\r\naccomplishes it, but to the imperfections of our social and financial\r\nsystems which make such resorts possible. Then, instead of committing\r\nthis new national organization against any form of legal labor, its\r\nmanagers should have proposed remedies for the existing imperfections in\r\nour systems.\r\n\r\nWe are no special advocate of the introduction of Chinese or any other\r\nlabor into this country; neither are we desirous of advocating any\r\npolicy that will conflict with the interests of any laborer, but we are\r\nadvocates, and always expect to be, of justice and equity to all people\r\neverywhere, because the time has come in the ages when we must begin to\r\nremember that we are all brothers under the sun, and that he or she who\r\ndoes not recognize and act upon this universal truth will, sooner or\r\nlater, be obliged to learn it at the cost of dear experience. We expect\r\nto be found advocating very many of the principles laid down in the\r\nplatform of the Labor party, and could wish that we may find nothing\r\nthere adverse to the principles which are of general application. We\r\ndesire to see the Labor interest advanced to the right and position of\r\nequality with capital, and we shall put forth our best endeavors to\r\nassist in this most just movement. At the same time we shall not commit\r\nourselves to sustain or advocate anything that we conceive will be\r\nultimately injurious to the true interests of humanity, or any part of\r\nit, therefore we shall at all times point out what we regard as errors\r\nin whatsoever this new party may endeavor to carry out. At the same time\r\nwe shall, perhaps, be among its firmest and truest advocates. The best\r\nfriends are those who show us our faults and sustain us in the right.\r\n\r\n NEW YORK, September 3, 1870.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      PAPERS ON LABOR AND CAPITAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                NO. IX.\r\n\r\nThis question forms one of the corner-stones of future society, but of\r\nall the questions in which society seems interested it is the worst\r\nunderstood. Four-fifths of the people of the world toil on, year after\r\nyear, and all the time see the other fifth revelling in the luxuries the\r\nsweat of their brows has produced. While the one-fifth enjoy the\r\nluxuries thus produced, as though they had acquired them by divine\r\nright, which none may call in question nor dispute, the great power of\r\nthe laboring many has never been felt. It has never been concentrated or\r\norganized into concert of action. Even now this immense force is still\r\ndispersed. It seems to have no centre around which it can gather. It has\r\nno organization, and herein lies its weakness.\r\n\r\nOrganization should be effected for two principal ends: First, for\r\nconstruction; second, for destruction. The old systems cumber the ground\r\nwhereon the new must be reared, and they must be pulled down to give it\r\nroom; nevertheless, the constructive part of the operation must first\r\nbegin; before the old will yield, the new must at least be formulated.\r\nThis is not impossible in the department of principles. This new rests\r\nupon foundations deeper down than existing things, and these can,\r\ntherefore, be used previously to the destruction of the foundations of\r\nthe old. The new also reaches higher than the old; hence its frame-work\r\nmay be reared, while yet the old stand comparatively intact. The work of\r\nconstruction once begun, that of destruction must necessarily\r\nimmediately follow, and when the former shall have been completed the\r\nlatter will have been but finished. This is the philosophy of\r\nIntegration and of Disintegration in all departments of the universe.\r\n\r\nLabor and Capital is a question relating in the first instance to the\r\nmaterial prosperity of a people; but secondarily it reacts upon all\r\nother interests—intellectual, moral, physical and religious. None of\r\nthese interests can flourish among a people who are burdened by material\r\nwants; neither are they usually unitedly prosperous among that part of a\r\npeople who are greatly advanced in material possessions. Either extreme\r\nin material interests appears to be deleterious to the best and most\r\nharmonious general advancement of all the other interests. It is the\r\nmean between the extremes—the calling up from those below, and the\r\nleveling down of those above the mean—in which the harmony of all is\r\nfound.\r\n\r\nHarmony of all the interests of humanity can alone be attained through\r\norganization. A permanent basis of organization can only be discovered\r\nby scientific investigation. The organization of society must be\r\nrealized through the science of sociology, which, of all sciences is the\r\nleast understood by the general mind. Yet there are among the great\r\nminds of the planet a large number of those who thoroughly comprehend\r\nthis science, and it is to these that the world must look for a\r\nreconstruction of its society upon such principles as shall render it\r\npermanent; upon such, as it can constantly be improved upon, without\r\nchanging its methods of operation.\r\n\r\nInto such a reconstruction the branch of sociology that relates to\r\nproduction and use, or labor and capital, will enter largely, and must\r\nbe the portion of it to be first entered upon, because all things which\r\nare built upon earth must have a material foundation until there shall\r\nbe such a harmony and unity of interests, and such co-operation among\r\nmankind as would proceed from a universal brotherhood, in which each\r\nwould have his special part to perform to contribute to the common\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nThe agitation that is beginning to be felt all over the world where\r\nintelligent labor exists, indicates that the time is at hand wherein the\r\nfirst steps toward a constructive organization of society, upon\r\nscientific principles, is to be begun. Not only is this agitation shown\r\nto exist in this country, but it has lately been developed that labor\r\nsocieties exist throughout Europe, having a common head and centre, and\r\nthat they deem themselves strong enough to express wishes entirely\r\nantagonistic to the ruling powers.\r\n\r\nNow what these organizations require to become—something more than mere\r\ninstruments for agitation, mere means by which the injustice between\r\nlabor and capital is exposed—is to become constructive in their action;\r\ninstead of expending all their means and strength in the work of pulling\r\ndown the old systems of things, they should begin the actual\r\nconstruction of a new system. For this end they must bring science—the\r\nscience of sociology—to their aid, and make its professors active\r\nleaders and trusted assistants in the grand work. Capital is putting\r\nforth some strong efforts to confine science in its interests, but the\r\nteachings of science are of too general and cosmopolitan a character to\r\npermit its professors to ally themselves with a pseudo aristocracy—the\r\naristocracy of wealth.\r\n\r\nWell may the political parties view with alarm the beginning of\r\norganization among the classes they have until now relied upon to carry\r\nthemselves into power. If bereft of the capacity to influence the masses\r\nwho heretofore have not thought for themselves, they know their power\r\nwill depart. How has it been possible thus long for leaders to control\r\nthe masses, except that the masses have permitted others to act for\r\nthem, and that without rendering any account for such action? The time\r\nfor such representation has passed. The people have arrived at that\r\ndegree of understanding of their actual interests, that will not admit\r\nof a blind acquiescence in all that even a “People’s Congress” may do.\r\nThey will begin to instruct their representatives instead of being led\r\nby them.\r\n\r\n’Tis true that by capital coming to the rescue of the country it is\r\nintact to-day; but it asked its price and has been paid. So far the\r\nobligation is removed, and justice to all is demanded. Legislation\r\nentirely in the interests of capital will not be any longer tacitly\r\nacknowledged as binding those whose interests are sacrificed. Whatever\r\nobligations the country may be under to those who hold its securities,\r\nit is under still greater to the producing interest, to which it must\r\nlook for the ability to retire them when called upon so to do by the\r\ntenor of the contract they contain. It thus appears that all the\r\ninterests and all the prosperity of the country are dependent upon the\r\nproducing classes, and therefore to them government must listen, for\r\nthey will not be ignored much longer.\r\n\r\n NEW YORK, Oct. 10, 1870.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      PAPERS ON LABOR AND CAPITAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 NO. X.\r\n\r\nProduction lies at the basis of all progress. Material production\r\nprecedes all other kinds of acquirement. In the first degrees of social\r\nevolution, labor was merely to obtain the means of bodily sustenance and\r\ncomfort; from this the present has widely departed; while the future\r\nmust still further widen the distance between production as an end and\r\nproduction as the means to some end beyond. Production in early times\r\nmeant simple muscular toil; it still means this, but also a great deal\r\nmore; the proper direction of power makes it possible for a given amount\r\nof force to accomplish a greatly increased result. In the next century\r\nmake proportionate rapid advancement in the better adaptation of means\r\nto ends than last made over the preceding, the direct application of\r\nmuscular exertion to accomplish a material purpose will be almost\r\nunknown. Steam and water have relieved muscle of nearly all its most\r\nlaborious occupations and increased the capacity of production a\r\nthousand fold.\r\n\r\nThe reduction of these powers to the uses of man will be supplemented by\r\nthat of still more subtle and powerful agents to the same end, and this\r\nreduction will be followed by a proportionate relief to manual labor.\r\nThe results of this advancement in the discovery of the means of\r\nreducing the elements of nature to the service of man, is to be\r\nrevolutionary to the present grades and distinctions between the laborer\r\nand the capitalist—unless a proper understanding and application of the\r\nscience of society first perform that inevitable result—which will\r\nguarantee to all individuals the possibility of like attainment in all\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nScience equalizes everything that comes within its sphere. Let the great\r\nscientist be never so destitute of material wealth, he is still the\r\ngreat man sought for and honored by those who have nothing but material\r\nwealth to recommend them. Any person may incidentally become wealthy in\r\nmaterial possessions, but none but the devoted student of nature can\r\nbecome rich in mind; and, none but the devoted philanthropist can become\r\nrich in heart and soul. Even those who have immense earthly possessions,\r\nshow their consciousness of inferiority by courting the great in other\r\nfields of acquirement. This alone should teach all people that true\r\ngreatness is not to be gained through riches, and that these should only\r\nbe considered advantageous as the means by which to acquire other\r\ngreater riches and blessings.\r\n\r\nThe true uses of wealth are to advance the peoples of earth from the\r\nconditions in which they are to higher and better conditions, to those\r\nwhere caste and distinctions shall not be measured by it, but by the\r\ngood that is accomplished by its use, in which he will be considered the\r\ngreatest man and the most honored, who shall make the best uses of\r\nmaterial wealth in benefiting humanity as a common brotherhood.\r\n\r\nIt has become too late in the ages for individuals to think of living\r\nfor themselves, or even for those immediately connected with them.\r\nMutuality of interest is spreading from family interests to world-wide\r\ninterests, and the greatest minds of the present are those which\r\nperceive and act upon this fact. The leavening power of assimilation is\r\nrapidly at work among the nations, races and peoples of the earth. The\r\nelectric telegraph makes it possible for all the different nations of\r\nthe earth to be possessed of the same thought at the same time. For the\r\nlast two months the minds of the whole world have been turned toward\r\nFrance, where the real contest of the future has but just begun. It is\r\nimpossible for this concentration of mind upon one centre to be\r\nproductive of anything but a growing likeness among those who are the\r\nsubjects of it. All the discoveries in all departments of life tend to\r\nthe same unification of thought and interest. In this unification is\r\ncontained the prophecy of what the future shall be when no individual,\r\nfamily, nation or race, shall feel that they can live entirely for\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nThe lesson the present movers in labor reforms have to learn is that of\r\nharmonizing the interests of labor and capital by the demonstrations of\r\nscience. Springing from a common source and tending toward a common end,\r\nhumanity must learn to progress on its course according to rule, to law\r\nand the requirements of order. These sustain the harmonies of the\r\nuniverse, and should be never-failing authorities for humanity to\r\npattern after. Those who achieve the greatest conquests are they who can\r\nbring themselves into harmony with the principles that govern the\r\nmovements of the innumerable worlds, no two of which are ever known to\r\ndisastrously cross each other’s path.\r\n\r\nThe world is capable of producing luxuriousness for all its children. It\r\nis their fault that all do not have it. A very large proportion of the\r\ncapacity of humanity for production is diverted from natural occupations\r\nby the illegitimate relations existing in society. A part live off of\r\nthe vitality of the rest; the principal object of the part being to see\r\nhow much of the fruits of the rest they can aggregate, either by\r\npersonal capacity, trickery or cunning, or by ingenious devices of law\r\nformed and administered in their interests. A perfect equality and an\r\nequal justice condemns all such distributions of the fruits of the\r\nearth. If capacity for acquisition exist among a part of the people,\r\ngovernment should interfere to stop its being practiced at the expense\r\nof others.\r\n\r\nWe are aware that this kind of social rule will be repudiated as an\r\ninfringement upon individual freedom of action. In this connection,\r\nhowever, it must ever be remembered that the individual can never be\r\ngreater than the community of which he forms a part; in other words, the\r\ninterests of the community must always be superior to those of the\r\nindividual, and when individual interests conflict with the interest of\r\nthe community they must yield to the community. This principle is\r\nrecognized in very many things in government; for instance, the public\r\ndemands a common highway which must interfere with the rights and\r\ninterests of individuals; the individuals are compelled to give way for\r\nthe public, from whose adjudgment there is no appeal. To this rule of\r\naction all the relations of society must sooner or later become subject,\r\nand the sooner it is reduced to this scientific determining power, the\r\nquicker society will have begun a progress whose course need never be\r\ndeviated from.\r\n\r\n NEW YORK, October 17, 1870.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      PAPERS ON LABOR AND CAPITAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                NO. XI.\r\n\r\nOne of “our Fundamental Propositions” is the ultimate analysis of the\r\nperfected results of harmonious relations between labor and its reward.\r\nIt is not laid down in any spirit of mere speculation, but as a mark\r\nwhich the human family is capable of attaining, and one to which it\r\nshould aspire. Neither is it at all impossible with some of the present\r\nrepresentatives of the race; but it is a natural and legitimate\r\ncondition for society when it shall have become sufficiently “grown” to\r\nbe possible of organization.\r\n\r\nOrganization is the first step to be made toward reaching such\r\nconditions as the proposition indicate. Simple individual exertion can\r\nnever be constructive of society. Neither can the exertions of a great\r\nnumber of individuals become constructive unless their action is\r\ncombined or organized in one direction and for the same purpose.\r\nAgitation must always precede organization, and hence it is that nearly\r\nall primary movements are simply destructive or disintegrating to\r\nexisting conditions. A perfect system of society cannot be organized to\r\nconta in those who are under any condition of servitude other than is\r\nrendered by the collective number to the law or rule they shall\r\nformulate, to control these relations. A perfect system of freedom is\r\none of the first essentials, and this must be regulated by an exact\r\njustice, as between a community of brothers and sisters. No ignoring of\r\nany part of the community, whether male or female, can exist The\r\norganization must recognize each and every member of the community, and\r\nthey in turn must also recognize the organization which becomes the rule\r\nof government.\r\n\r\nNo one will attempt to deny but that there is sufficient capital or\r\nwealth in the world to enable every one to live in a palace; neither\r\nwould any deny that the conditions of humanity would be very much\r\nimproved could such a leveling down and such a leveling up, as this\r\nequalization would require, be attained. This cannot result from any\r\narbitrary rule of force, but must be the result of the operation of the\r\nproper principles of law in the relations of society. It must emanate\r\nfrom a consciousness within society itself of the justice of such\r\nprinciples therefore the mind of society must be imbued with these\r\nprinciples; and to do this is the business of those who understand the\r\nscience of society. It has been denied that there is a science of\r\nsociety. The recognition now that there is such a science, and the fact\r\nthat the evolution of society thus far has been formulated under it, is\r\na vast step toward a general recognition of it. When once it is\r\ngenerally received as one of the demonstrated sciences, there will be\r\nvarious attempts in all directions to organize upon its not yet\r\ndemonstrated principles.\r\n\r\nThose who have followed these articles will begin to see that the\r\nattainment of great wealth will not constitute one of the principal aims\r\nof the society of the future. It will only be considered as a means to\r\nother and higher ends. It has not been until quite recently that the\r\nfact of continuous life has been any more than _theoretically_ received.\r\nThe practices of mankind have been just such, and only such, as would\r\nobtain, were there no life after physical death, and they have lived as\r\nthough the whole of this life should be devoted to purely material ends,\r\nto the gratification of physical desires, and to comforts and pleasures\r\narising from material possessions. Since the conviction has been\r\nstealing into the minds of humanity that life is continuous, that death\r\nis simply a change of the conditions of life, and that the best wealth\r\nthat can be accumulated in the material life is that kind that will make\r\nthe best capital to begin the next with, there is a marked change in the\r\ncommunity at large.\r\n\r\nIt is beginning to be realized that there is a great deal more to live\r\nfor in this life than mere bodily satisfaction and accumulation of\r\nwealth—of money. Nor is complete luxury one of the most preferable of\r\ncircumstances. It is not conducive, under present conditions, to the\r\nbest and most rapid development of the true wealth of the soul, nor can\r\nit ever be until correct views of the uses of wealth more generally\r\nobtain than they do at present.\r\n\r\nIn a true condition of society there would be no such thing as wealth,\r\nin its present signification. It would be reduced to the requirements of\r\nmen in obtaining better wealth for themselves, and for the diffusion of\r\nit among their kind. In this consideration of the uses of life, there is\r\nno more important feature of it than that of organization in all\r\ndepartments. Such organization as will dispose of misery, poverty,\r\nignorance and crime. All these can be cast out of society; and it is to\r\nbe sincerely hoped for, that there will be formed a political party\r\nhaving its basis in the necessity and the possibility of such a\r\ndisposal. Such conditions cannot exist in the midst of a community\r\nwithout exerting their deleterious influences over the higher and better\r\nconditions. People lose sight of this fact, and in all legislation it is\r\nignored. Government now has the power to take these conditions in hand,\r\nand none are more interested in having it do so than the so-called labor\r\nparty. Why should not this party organize upon some such radical\r\nprinciples of reform that will reach the roots of the ills they feel\r\nsociety labors under?\r\n\r\nThe policy of a party that would be permanently successful must be one\r\nthat will include all of the great principles of reform. If such a party\r\nis not shortly organized, there will be conditions developed which will\r\nmake such a party a necessity, even without organization. It would arise\r\nas if by magic out of the conditions of the times, and leaders will rise\r\nand come to the front as though Heaven-directed, and they will be\r\nreceived by the people by acclamation. The force of elections will be\r\ndispensed with, and party trickery forever killed.\r\n\r\nThe whole substrata of society is in foment. The terrific strifes that\r\nhave been waged, and are being waged, lift the weight from the strata,\r\nand it begins to rise into demanding such recognition as has not been\r\naccorded it. The “Moses” who shall divide the “waters of the Red Sea,”\r\nthat separates them from their “Canaan,” will be their God-appointed\r\nleader, whom to oppose would be futile. Political parties have been in\r\nthe hands of such leaders, and have been used for such corrupt purposes,\r\nthat the people have lost all confidence in them, and they demand A NEW\r\nORDER OF THINGS, in which common honesty may properly find a place.\r\n\r\nLabor and capital, lying, as they do, at the foundation of present\r\nsociety, and as they will enter largely into all societies of the\r\nfuture, so long as material wants are conducive to the true interests of\r\nhumanity, should receive such consideration at the hands of the present\r\nas will so arrange their interests that there may be no violent\r\ndisruption between them, when present governmental forms shall change.\r\nThe sphere of government must be enlarged and made to include very many\r\nquestions which are now utterly ignored, before society can ever be\r\nconsidered as resting upon a surely permanent foundation. To arrive at\r\nthis foundation is the first and most important step for humanity to\r\ntake. All minor ones are insignificant beside it, because the corner\r\nstones of this foundation must consist of a perfect individual justice,\r\nwhich will not be inconsistent nor at war with perfect collective\r\njustice. This condition the present inequalities between labor and\r\ncapital forbid, and hence the importance of their harmonization.\r\n\r\n NEW YORK, October 25, 1870.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      PAPERS ON LABOR AND CAPITAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                NO. XII.\r\n\r\nPerhaps there is a no more suggestive or instructive fact in all the\r\nrealm of society than that the laboring classes are the liberal classes.\r\nIt is among them that nearly all social reforms begin, and among them\r\nthat all governmental reforms first find moving power. The wealthy\r\nclasses are systematically conservative; and by instinct they are\r\nopposed to all movements which tend to equalization. They are to social\r\nreform just what bigots are to religious liberalization. They adopt a\r\ncreed which their practice is never to depart from, and it is only by\r\nthe force of the large majority of the people combined against them that\r\nthey ever do depart from them. The time was when it was the grossest\r\ninfidelity to question any of the extravagant assertions contained in\r\nthe Bible; but nearly all Christian sects now assume the right to place\r\ntheir own construction upon what is found therein. This construction is\r\nfound to grow more human and liberal every year. Twenty years ago, the\r\nmore “hell-fire and brimstone” a minister gave forth, the more Gospel it\r\nwas considered that he taught. The same rule obtains in regard to all\r\nsocial questions, and the same rule of extending liberalization will\r\ncontinue, until the balancing point of equalization is reached, in which\r\nthere shall be no power to determine for the individual, except himself\r\nor herself, what is for his or her individual good, or what to him or\r\nher is right.\r\n\r\nWealth, in its present position, is aristocratic; and Labor, in its\r\npresent position, is democratic. Aristocracy always assumes to control\r\nthat which is under it, in a material sense. It has always assumed this\r\ncontrol, and whenever possible has exercised it. This assumption has\r\nbeen exercised so long that those over whom it has been swayed have come\r\nto regard it as something approaching a “divine right.” This condition\r\nof servitude was possible so long as ignorance possessed the masses over\r\nwhom it sought control. When education began its silent yet potent work,\r\nthe power of assumed “divine right” began to weaken. General education\r\nis all that the world requires to emancipate it from the rule of all\r\nkinds of aristocracy. Common schools for children, and the public press\r\nfor adults, have done and are doing the work of emancipation.\r\n\r\nIt was not until quite recently that the representatives of labor began\r\nto know the benefits to be derived from organization. They do not yet\r\nknow the full benefits which it is possible for them to obtain from it;\r\nmuch that they do obtain from it is, on the whole, deleterious rather\r\nthan beneficial. They require more general knowledge. They need the aid\r\nof science to point out the paths in which they should seek to walk.\r\nScience, to the organizations of labor, is what discipline is to the\r\narmy. Without it, the first is powerless, and the last dangerous to\r\nthose who command and support it.\r\n\r\nIt is very much to be regretted that so much of bitter denunciation of\r\nthe wealthy is heard among laborers. It shows that they, if possessed of\r\nthe power, would wield it more despotically than it is now wielded by\r\nthose possessing it. Force, as a regulator, can at best be but a mere\r\ntemporary makeshift, which, unless quickly followed by justice in\r\norganization, degenerates into absolutism. This is the danger which it\r\nis to be feared would follow the elevation of labor into the position\r\nnow occupied by wealth. Hence it is that it takes long years of\r\ndisappointment to chasten the hearts of those who seek change, before\r\nthe order of civilization will allow it to come in its fullest extent.\r\n\r\nCould changes in society be arranged and managed as changes in other\r\ndepartments are, no danger would ever supervene. New railroad bridges\r\nare constructed before the old ones are removed, and throughout the\r\nprocess of change the trains continue their regular movements. So it\r\nwill be with society, when science shall have so enlightened the people\r\nthat they shall know just what they are preparing to pass to.\r\n\r\nThe Labor Party now desires to be elevated into political place and\r\npower; but have its advocates any well-defined ideas regarding the\r\nresults which are to follow such a change in the administration of\r\ngovernment? It is much to be feared that the same old story of “Make hay\r\nwhile the sun shines,” would be the ruling element. We would not have it\r\nunderstood from these suggestions that we are opposed to such a change\r\nas the success of the Labor Party would imply. Any change cannot be for\r\nthe worse. Principle could not, in any event, be less the ruling power\r\nthan now; nor could money buy more politicians than it does now. One has\r\nto spend but a “season” in Washington to convince himself that there is\r\na deal more truth than there is vulgarity in the saying, that “money\r\nmakes the mare go.” Representatives and Senators who prate with loudest\r\nmouths of patriotism and devotion, spend all their own money and all\r\nthey can borrow to get to Congress, and retire to private life, having\r\nmade a fortune upon “five thousand a year.” The inference is too\r\npalpably plain. It is not necessary for us to say that all such fortunes\r\nare the results of bribery and corruption, and their possessors public\r\nthieves, and utterly unworthy of the confidence of honest devotees to a\r\npopular form of government.\r\n\r\nIt is this species of corruption that is becoming a stench in the\r\nnostrils of all those whose patriotism is more than pocket deep. In its\r\ngrowth they see the process of national disintegration begun, which they\r\nwell know cannot continue indefinitely without bringing destruction to\r\nour country. The almost criminal indifference with which the masses of\r\nthe people regard these examples of the power of money over the\r\nconsciences of those to whom they have intrusted their most sacred\r\npolitical rights, speaks badly for the safety of republican\r\ninstitutions, as now operated. A saving power is needed. Where shall it\r\nbe sought? All true reformers are looking to the Labor party for it. Let\r\nit unite to itself the principle of equal rights, regardless of sex, and\r\nit will succeed. Then, if it fill its mission well, it will prove itself\r\nto be what the present demands, to crush corruption which is so rapidly\r\npermeating our whole body politic.\r\n\r\n NEW YORK, November 1, 1870.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      PAPERS ON LABOR AND CAPITAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               NO. XIII.\r\n\r\nThe principles which should regulate these two great interests are, even\r\nin this age of scientific attainment and philosophic speculation, very\r\nimperfectly considered and still more imperfectly understood. There can\r\nbe no perfect practice of the true principles which should govern their\r\nrelations until the practices of the peoples are based on the\r\nrecognition of the fact of the common brotherhood of humanity. There are\r\na few people now living who fully appreciate the relationship which\r\nexists between the peoples of the world, and who would regulate their\r\nconduct toward their brothers by the “Golden Rule.” All the governments\r\nof the world are in direct opposition to this rule; hence it becomes an\r\nutter impossibility for isolated individuals to practice upon it to any\r\ngreat extent.\r\n\r\nIt is an acknowledged fact that the world is gradually being evolved by\r\nthe means of government; and that government was at first organized to\r\ncontrol individuals who would otherwise have operated from their own\r\nstandpoint for selfish purposes. This kind of control will continue to\r\nbe exercised until government will be able to control all individuals to\r\nact for the general public good, and this again will eventuate in all\r\npeople acting for the public good of their own accord, when government\r\nin its present sense and for its present purposes will be done away\r\nwith.\r\n\r\nThe relations of labor and capital are most intimately connected with\r\nthe frame-work of all governments, because they could not exist without\r\ntheir active support. The difficulty with all present systems of\r\ngovernment is that they are built upon the supposition that capital is\r\nthe primarily controlling power; while the fact is that behind capital\r\nlabor stands first and strongest. As intelligence becomes more and more\r\ngenerally diffused the domination of capital over labor becomes weaker\r\nand weaker, and the dignity of labor more and more apparent, and, as a\r\nnecessary result of the growth of this sentiment, labor is accorded more\r\nand wider privileges.\r\n\r\nIt is a singular fact, and one to be regarded with a feeling bordering\r\non astonishment, that it is possible for all legislation to be either\r\nconducted in the interests of capital or controlled by it, when the\r\ncapitalists of the country are to the laborers as one is to ten. The\r\nsame principle makes it possible for one man to control a dozen horses\r\npossessed of a hundred times his own strength. It is the power of\r\nknowledge over ignorance. The horses on the one hand are ignorant of\r\ntheir real power and yield it obediently to the command of assumed\r\nauthority. So, too, is it with the mass of laborers; they do not know\r\ntheir real power and they yield obedience to the power of assumption\r\naided by a superior intellect.\r\n\r\nIt is for this reason that the general diffusion of knowledge among the\r\ncommon people should receive so much more attention than it has or does.\r\nEvery child, whether born of wealth or poverty, should inherit the right\r\nfrom government of a complete education in all the important branches of\r\neducation. Not only should they inherit this right but the government\r\nshould see to it that the right is obtained, compulsorily if need be.\r\nThe acquisition of knowledge has ever tended to the liberalization of\r\nexisting orders of things, and it was not until something akin to its\r\ngeneral diffusion was obtained that any adequate ideas of the advantages\r\nof freedom became fixed in the minds of the people. It was a\r\ngrand—almost a fatally grand—mistake which the people made when they\r\nconsidered that they had obtained complete freedom when they emancipated\r\nthemselves from the so-called “tyranny” of England.\r\n\r\nFirst, then, and that which is the basis of all other tyranny, is the\r\nfact that man, individually considered, is, in the strictest sense of\r\nthe term, a slave to the conditions of his existence. Whatever else he\r\nmay be free to perform he can never be emancipated from the necessity of\r\nyielding obedience to the demands of this existence. In his ignorant,\r\nundeveloped condition, intellectually, he has been led to yield himself\r\nin obedience to others whom it seemed to him were able by their\r\nsuperiority, mentally, to better administer to these prime necessities\r\nthan he could do it for himself. This was the argument for the\r\ncontinuation of slavery in the South. They said the negroes were better\r\noff than they would be if cast upon their own resources for the supply\r\nof the necessities of life. Many persons felt the strength of this\r\nargument and yielded to its pleading. It is the same principle—that of\r\ninferior intelligence yielding to superior intelligence—which makes the\r\npossibility of all forms of slavery. It is this principle which has made\r\nit thus long possible for government to be conducted entirely in the\r\ninterests of capital.\r\n\r\nBut it is just at this point, where the beginning of comprehension on\r\nthe part of the representatives of labor is, that the fallaciousness of\r\nthis arbitrary form of control begins to be felt by the masses who have\r\nhitherto yielded to it. They begin to see that they obtained freedom\r\nfrom one “tyranny” only to yield themselves to another, less odious than\r\nit was from the fact that one was represented by one person, while the\r\nother is represented by numerous persons. In some regards the last\r\ncondition is worse than the first; for in it there is nothing to guard\r\nthe constant encroachments of the tyrant upon their “reserved” rights.\r\nThey are constantly subjected to legislation which filches from them the\r\nlast possible farthing, that it may go to swell the coffers of some\r\nwealthy individual or some obese corporation.\r\n\r\nAt present the indications are anything but favorable for the interests\r\nof the producing classes. It seems as though the representatives of\r\ncorporate interests, in which large amounts of money are invested, are\r\norganizing to make a crusade against the present possessed rights of the\r\nproducing classes, to the end that, by all corporate organizations\r\ncombining and making their interests mutual, they may come into the\r\nposition that shall give them supreme and lasting control over the\r\ndestinies of the country. They behold with jealousy the attempts at\r\norganization among laborers, knowing that, if it is carried to its full\r\nresults, it will compel equality of interest and obtain the means\r\nnecessary to enforce it.\r\n\r\nIt is the age of rapid change. What it would once have required an age\r\nto accomplish, is now performed in a single night. It would not _be very\r\nstrange_ should the interests of labor control the next Presidential\r\nelection. One thing is patent to all, some great issue must come up\r\nwhich will be of sufficient magnitude and general importance to arouse\r\nthe people from the slough of indifference into which they have fallen\r\nsince the settlement of the slavery issue. It is also equally patent\r\nthat this issue must be some new combat between some form of slavery and\r\na growing freedom; perhaps a consolidation of the several questions of\r\nprogress into one interest to crush out, at once and forever, the reign\r\nof conservatism of all kinds, and the substitution therefor of an\r\nenlightened freedom, to be governed, guided and supported by the lights\r\nof science which shall point the way to all things which ought to be\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\nWhat the world needs to-day is, that science, supported by wealth, shall\r\ncome into power. Could this be arrived at, the dangers and difficulties\r\nnow hovering around the issues between the still captive and the\r\ninterests of enslaved labor, would be dispelled, and society, without\r\nfurther convulsive efforts, could assume its uninterrupted march toward\r\nperfect conditions of existence. It is to be feared that wealth will not\r\nyield to science, and that it will endeavor to bring it under its sway\r\nto further enslave the “toiling millions” and make them minister longer\r\nto its despotism. Let this be as it may, the existence of government\r\nupon its present basis of liberty and equality depends upon its checking\r\na power that is being organized to control it. The New York _Herald_,\r\nnot many days ago, pointed out this danger, but did not warn the people\r\nthat it was a danger, leaving each to gather his or her own deduction\r\nfrom the mere presentation of the facts. Subsequently, however, it said,\r\neditorially, as follows:\r\n\r\n  “Now it is possible the American people may not be alarmed at the\r\n  probable effects a combination of the capital and influence of these\r\n  vast railroad corporations may have upon the future of the\r\n  country—upon the permanency of its institutions and the perpetuity of\r\n  its political liberties; but, in view of possible contingencies, we\r\n  think we are justified in cautioning the people against the possible\r\n  creation of a railroad oligarchy here that may prove as dangerous to\r\n  the nation in times to come as was the Southern cotton oligarchy in\r\n  times past.\r\n\r\n  “This subject is one of considerable interest to the American people,\r\n  and the elections of members to the next Congress should be graduated\r\n  accordingly.”\r\n\r\nIt is the duty, then, of the New Labor Party to become the best\r\nrepresentative of general reform and a wider freedom for all\r\nindividuals, male and female, which freedom should have no limit except\r\nthat which borders upon interference with the freedom and rights of\r\nothers, or that would be detrimental to the common interests of the\r\npublic if practiced. In the widest freedom there is the most virtue,\r\nbecause, under restraint, compulsion often passes for virtue, while its\r\nsemblance only is there. Freedom stamps all that is genuine, and exposes\r\nand denounces all that is counterfeit and affected. Enforced virtue in\r\nany direction, except for the protection of the community, is not one of\r\nthe principles of a free government; but everything that the government\r\ncan do that will further the interests of the community, come\r\nlegitimately within its sphere. And it is to this end and purpose that\r\nthe Labor party should press its claims to recognition upon the\r\nrepresentatives of labor.\r\n\r\nThe workingman makes the government, and therefore has it in his hands\r\nto unmake it. If the government is not what it should be, it is because\r\nthe workingmen have permitted it to exist and not perform its duty. It\r\nseems, then, that the _main point at issue_ is, to acquaint the\r\nrepresentatives of labor everywhere with their power; to make them\r\nrecognize the fact that they, being the majority, have it in their power\r\nto elect the men who will legislate in their interests, and, by so\r\ndoing, do away with this insane denunciation of wealth by the mouths of\r\nthose would-be leaders, who, to become leaders, would stir up any kind\r\nof strife, required to gain their wishes. Of all such, the Labor Party\r\nshould beware.\r\n\r\n NEW YORK, Nov. 10, 1870.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      PAPERS ON LABOR AND CAPITAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                NO. XIV\r\n\r\nWe have repeatedly appealed to the productive classes to arouse from the\r\nslough of trustfulness and indifference in which they have remained so\r\nlong, and to bestir themselves about their business of governing\r\nthemselves. Thus far they have utterly failed in all duties of\r\nself-government. They have nominally lived in a country which proffers\r\nequality to all, but under which proffering they have virtually\r\nsurrendered themselves to be governed by the considered mighty few, who,\r\nfor their own purposes, exalt themselves into the position of The\r\nPeople’s candidates until office is obtained, when they begin at once to\r\ninvent schemes for continuing themselves in power; or, if they know it\r\nis impossible to be again returned, they devote themselves to making the\r\nmost of what time they have.\r\n\r\nThe present doings of the people’s representatives, both State and\r\nnational, are practically limited to getting the most they can for\r\nthemselves and their friends, while the study of the interests of their\r\nconstituents and the country is either entirely ignored or shirked to\r\nthe greatest possible extent. Each year this condition becomes more and\r\nmore the controlling element of Congress and Legislature, and unless\r\nsoon remedied, it will lead the country on blindly to its destruction.\r\nThis course being directly in the interest of special and favored\r\ninterests, has the favor and support of capital, while labor looks on\r\nwith the utmost indifference, and sees its productions filched year\r\nafter year.\r\n\r\nCapital, of the two, is the more foolishly blind to its future; for it\r\ndoes not seem to comprehend that with the continuation of this course\r\nmust come the day of reckoning, in which the debit side of all accounts\r\nwill be heavily against it—so heavily that it will never be able to\r\nsatisfy the demand which humanity will have for it to settle.\r\n\r\nThis consummation may be averted, but only in one way. The laboring\r\nclasses must exercise their right of self-government themselves, after\r\nthe dictates of reason and common sense, and no longer blindly intrust\r\ntheir interests and the common interests of the country to the\r\nself-selected few who prate with so much volubility, and who mouth the\r\n“King’s English” so furiously about their undying patriotism and\r\nself-denying devotion. It may be set down at once and for all time that\r\nthe patriotism and devotion professed by this class of orators and\r\nstatesmen will be certain to continue until after their election is\r\nsure, after which it will do to watch them carefully lest they may have\r\nentirely expended it in their efforts for election.\r\n\r\nWhile we have urged the laboring classes to arouse, we have at the same\r\ntime shown the necessity of complete and thorough organization, and we\r\nnow further urge the absolute withdrawal of affiliation with any party,\r\nand the devotion of their entire strength to the construction of their\r\nown party, upon the principles of freedom, equality and justice for all,\r\nlet them lead where they may. All that is required by them is granted in\r\nthe present Constitution, though, perhaps, in some points, were so,\r\nblindly, for the time, but which are now made plain and clear by late\r\nevents in some of our States.\r\n\r\nIt is time that active movements should begin to be made toward\r\norganization for the next Presidential election. Both political parties\r\nare manœuvring in every possible direction to gain advantages. If the\r\nLabor Party will act wisely it can take up one of these parties and\r\nincorporate its remnants before the election comes off. But if the class\r\nwho should form this party will remain stupidly blind, and continue to\r\nmaintain these virtually defunct parties by their strength, instead of\r\nconstructing a new party of their own, nothing which will positively\r\nshape the future course of events can be accomplished. The old will\r\nsimply be bolstered up for another term, and four years more of\r\nsubmission to the behests and dictates of capital must be endured.\r\n\r\nThere will be a desperate attempt made during the coming session of\r\nCongress by capital to obtain further, and greater and stronger hold\r\nupon the vitals of the country. Efforts to effect the perpetuation of\r\nthe franchises it already has, it counts upon making, with certainty of\r\nsuccess; but the very extent of its efforts which it will make under the\r\nknowledge that what is to be obtained must be so at once, will press it\r\nto such extremes that it will most probably defeat its own purpose. This\r\nevent will be rendered certain if the Labor Party will take a positive\r\nstand upon its own ground, which will make effective the springing of\r\nsome “mines” that are prepared, which will put their representatives in\r\nsuch a light before the country as will most effectually dispose of all\r\nselfish schemes which are now afloat. Let it be seen that no shirking of\r\nduty is permitted on the part of pretended labor representatives, and\r\nalso let it be seen that all who lend themselves to the schemes of\r\ncapital are properly shown up to the country.\r\n\r\nOur interests are great and our country is dear to us, for it has cost\r\nus immense treasure and blood. Is it not worthy of being defended from\r\nall schemes, when so much has been required to construct and preserve\r\nit? To the care of laboring classes its preservation is now committed.\r\nWill they prove themselves worthy of the high trust? Or will they sell\r\ntheir birthright for less than a “mess of pottage?” Is it necessary that\r\nsome great calamity come before an awakening to the reality of the\r\ncondition will occur? Let it rather be, that wisdom be gleaned from the\r\nsore trials and the desperate situation of our brethren in France, which\r\nshall teach the use to be made of possessed rights and privileges.\r\n\r\n NEW YORK, November 18, 1870.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      PAPERS ON LABOR AND CAPITAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                NO. XV.\r\n\r\nThe New York _Sunday Despatch_, of the 20th inst., contains a lengthy,\r\ninteresting and highly instructive article, based upon recent interviews\r\nwith Thomas Hughes and J. P. Mundella, members of the British House of\r\nCommons, who are also workingmen and employers. They are strongly of the\r\nopinion that “strikes” were never productive of anything but damage to\r\nboth parties, and that arbitration is the only reasonable resort for the\r\nsettlement of all mooted questions between laborers and their employers.\r\n\r\nAs examples of the misery engendered by “strikes,” several instances are\r\nquoted, among which is found that of the potters and moulders in the\r\nvicinity of London, which proceeded to the very last extremity on the\r\npart of the strikers. Arbitration at last was resorted to, and resulted\r\nin no gain of conditions to the strikers.\r\n\r\nThese facts go to show that the immediate purposes of labor\r\norganizations are detrimental to their true interests. They must\r\nacknowledge that they cannot compel capital to their terms, and that in\r\nmoderate counsels and wise action they will be much more likely to find\r\ntheir interests advancing.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate purposes of the Labor party which are to obtain control of\r\nlegislation, may be productive of much good, or may be made the most\r\nfruitful cause of national disaster. We have all the time endeavored to\r\nshow that the real interests of both capital and labor lie in the\r\ndirection of complete unity; and that although labor is now suffering at\r\nthe instance of capital, that it should not be laid to the charge of\r\ncapital that it is in position to thus infringe upon the rights of\r\nlabor, but to the charge, secondarily, of legislation, which is\r\nperformed by the very men whom the laboring classes do their utmost to\r\nelect to office: and, primarily, to the imperfections in our present\r\nfinancial and social systems, which must be remedied before any very\r\ngreat benefit can accrue to the oppressed conditions of society.\r\n\r\nTo accomplish what is required in order that labor may rise to an\r\nequality with capital, the laboring classes must become enlightened upon\r\nthe principles of political and social economy. Revolution, which is\r\nthreatened from some quarters, would only lead away from justice and in\r\nthe direction of anarchy. We are sorry to be obliged to say that we can\r\nfind but little in the present propositions of the Labor Party which\r\npromises very much of good. For the most part, its leaders are bigoted\r\nand cliquish to the extreme, possessing but little of the philosophic\r\ncomprehension of the conditions through which labor must be elevated.\r\nDeclaration of principles in series of resolutions which form a\r\nnecessary part of all political gatherings amounts to nothing unless the\r\nparty presenting them “squares” itself by them. This is the fatal error\r\nof all parties and all governments. They set out by making certain\r\nfundamental declarations, which they afterward endeavor to compel into\r\nmeeting the exigencies of the times.\r\n\r\nThere is a great work the Labor Party can do. There are imperfections in\r\nour government, and these it should take up and remedy. It is a\r\nwell-established fact, as every one knows, that a government that is not\r\na representative of the minorities as well as of the majorities is not a\r\ngovernment of freedom, equality and justice. If imperfections exist even\r\nin the much revered Constitution, it should not be held so sacred that\r\nnone of its faults can be remedied. If there are inconsistencies in it,\r\nor if it contain provisions which the present has outgrown, let it be\r\nthoroughly amended, and as often as it can be, and made better. We do\r\nnot believe in anything being held so sacred as not to be submitted to a\r\ncomplete analysis, so that it may be determined just what there is good,\r\nand what there is which can be bettered. We are inclined to the opinion\r\nthat the whole Constitution should be revised, clarified and simplified,\r\nand made so plain that there would be no possibility of different\r\nconstructions being put upon any part of it.\r\n\r\nOur government should soon be so formulated, and the people so well\r\ninformed upon the true principles of government, that all existing\r\nadministrations should exist by the unanimous consent of all the people.\r\nThe strife should not be for party, representing different principles,\r\nbut for the best representative men to administer the Constitutional\r\nprinciples which all would be agreed upon.\r\n\r\nThere will a party arise having these objects in view, and it need not\r\nbe predicted that such a party, once organized, will begin a new era in\r\nthe history of governments, for sufficient comprehension of what the\r\nfuture will be exists to make this a foregone conclusion. The Labor\r\nParty should make itself that party. Has it the requisites?\r\n\r\n NEW YORK, November 25, 1870.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      PAPERS ON LABOR AND CAPITAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                NO. XVI.\r\n\r\nIn the full and legitimate consideration of this subject the range\r\nshould extend beyond the things immediately attaching to the capitalist\r\nand the laborer as persons, and merge into the question of Philosophic\r\nEquality, out of which consideration arises the true relations of the\r\nextremes of it represented by these two classes. Under a true republican\r\nform of government the inherent right to equality on the part of all its\r\ncitizens should not only be recognized but guaranteed. Equality, except\r\nas a mythical name, does not exist in practice in this country; nor for\r\nthat matter in any country, except where each individual is his own\r\ngovernor, to the extent of his power to maintain such authority; and\r\neach individual being possessed of this right to maintain it, comprises\r\nthat equality. Philosophic Equality presupposes the right of each\r\nindividual to exercise all the powers possessed by him, in which\r\nexercise the rights of no other individual would be interfered with, but\r\nwhich exercise should not be aided or protected by any device of law.\r\nThe moment a law is made to assist an individual, or any number of\r\nindividuals, in the performance of his or their undertaking, that moment\r\nequality on the part of all other citizens ceases. Not only is this true\r\nspecifically, but it is a great deal more; it is true generally that if\r\nan individual or a class of individuals receive aid, comfort and\r\nprotection from the law, in their pursuits, all other individuals of all\r\npursuits are rendered unequal in their competition with them in all of\r\ntheir respective pursuits.\r\n\r\nThat is to say, if a person is protected in the manufacture of salt by\r\nthe law, which imposes a heavy tax on all foreign salt imported into the\r\ncountry, the manufacturer or producer of grain is at once placed by the\r\nlaw in a condition of inequality with him, and in a double sense if he\r\nbe a consumer of salt; for not only is the price of the home\r\nmanufactured salt increased by the imposition of the tax, while the\r\nprice of the home grown grain is not proportionately increased, but the\r\nproducer of the grain is obliged to pay the increased price for the salt\r\nwhich he consumes. The same rule is applicable to all things wherein\r\nindividuals are obliged to seek protection from foreign importations, to\r\nbe able to produce the same at home.\r\n\r\nThe argument in favor of this course is, that while protection, extended\r\nto certain interests, increases the prices of their productions to the\r\nconsumers of them, the consumers by it are also enabled to obtain higher\r\nprices for what they have to place upon the market. This is all very\r\nwell so far as it has any application, but what is the effect upon the\r\nvery large proportion of the working people of the country who are not\r\nproducers of anything in their own right, but are simply laborers for\r\nsuch producers? If there is only an equality maintained to the employers\r\nof such labor, how can the benefit extend to the employed?\r\n\r\nIn making this complex argument, it is forgotten that real wealth and\r\nreal prosperity do not consist in high prices for everything, but in the\r\nquantity which is actually possessed. Prices under protection must ever\r\nfluctuate, and a person rich this year may be rendered poor next year,\r\nby the depreciation of his property. Witness the fall of real estate in\r\nthis city for an exemplification of what we mean. High prices are not\r\nthe ultimatum to be gained by any people of any country; but, on the\r\ncontrary, the true point to attain is the employment of the industry of\r\na country in those directions, wherein _the most can be produced at the\r\nleast cost_, in the accumulation of the proceeds of which the country,\r\nas a whole, must become wealthy more rapidly than in the pursuit of the\r\nother extreme, which is the production of the least at the greatest\r\ncost; or in any modification of this proposition.\r\n\r\nThe result of continuous protection to any interest of the country may\r\nbe exemplified by the application of it to something which comes\r\ndirectly home to us. Suppose that there are some gardeners on the upper\r\npart of Manhattan Island who appeal to the city authorities for\r\nprotection against the gardeners of Long Island, New Jersey, &c.,\r\nbecause their soil being not so fruitful as that of Long Island and New\r\nJersey, they cannot afford to sell their vegetables as low as those can\r\nbe sold which are produced outside. Thereupon a tax of twenty-five per\r\ncent. is levied by the city upon all foreign vegetables sold in the\r\nmarket. The result is, that all purchasers of vegetables in the city are\r\nforced to pay the additional cost merely to enable a few insignificant\r\npersons to pursue a calling which they would otherwise abandon for some\r\nother which they could pursue without protection. This, though a common\r\nillustration, exemplifies the operation of special protection in all its\r\nphases. It enables the few to pursue callings at the expense of the many\r\nwithout returning to that many any adequate benefit.\r\n\r\nThe trouble with our manufacturers is, that they want to get rich too\r\nfast. They are not willing to begin a new business in a way\r\nproportionate to their small means, and from this grow gradually into\r\nlarge producers as the manufacturers of other countries have done. They\r\nwant to be able to employ labor and pay much larger prices than are paid\r\nto those laborers who toil in unprotected industries. Nor is the laborer\r\nany better off in the general result. The laboring classes of the\r\ncountry are not so well off under the present system of high prices as\r\nthey were before the war, which indicates that the advance in wages has\r\nbeen more than counterbalanced by the increase in the prices of the\r\nlaborers’ necessities. As a general proposition, it is true that low\r\nprices are more favorable to the laborer than high prices; and that,\r\nunder a system of protection to special favored interests, those\r\ninterests become rich at the expense of the laborer; or, in more general\r\nterms, the rich become richer and the poor poorer with each succeeding\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nSuch is the general argument against protective duties; but it does not\r\nby any means follow that all protection should be immediately abandoned\r\nand Free Trade become at once and fully inaugurated. This would be as\r\ngrossly unjust to all these interests which have been encouraged into\r\nexistence by the present system, as that of protection was to the common\r\nindustries. What should be done is this: Unrestricted commerce, which\r\nwould allow of the natural demands of a country being supplied, without\r\nrestrictions of any kind, should be laid down as the true principle, and\r\na gradual approach from present protective measures to freedom be\r\ninaugurated. No immediate jump—nor even rapid advance that would produce\r\nmisfortune to any branch of industry, should it be attempted—but an\r\napproach, running through a sufficient number of years to allow of the\r\nadjustment of industries, should be the course. Under such a system all\r\nthe various industries of the country would gradually equalize, and the\r\nlaborers and employers in each would approach an equal footing. The\r\nfarmers of the rich Western prairies would no longer be able to complain\r\nof the discrimination of government in favor of the cotton, woolen and\r\niron manufacturers of the sterile East. Whether this policy is\r\nimmediately adopted by government or not, it certainly will be, when the\r\nrapidly increasing West shall become the dominant power in it. Better\r\nthat steps looking to it should be at once adopted than that it come\r\nafter awhile upon an unprepared country, which course has been so often\r\nerroneously pursued to the destruction, demoralization and\r\ndiscouragement of those classes of industries which require\r\nconsideration in their youth from the strong arm of the government; to\r\naccord which is not only for the interests of the country, but which is\r\nalso its duty to its acknowledged citizens; the error heretofore having\r\nbeen that the consideration thus extended has been at the expense of a\r\n_part of the citizens_ of the country and not at the expense of the\r\ncountry as a whole.\r\n\r\nEquality to all the citizens of the country can only be possible where\r\nthere is no special discrimination on the part of government toward any,\r\nwhether that discrimination is in the form of specific protective\r\nduties, unequal levies of taxes, or through devices of law; or, in other\r\nwords, equality is an impossibility so long as special legislation is\r\nallowed either in our State or National councils.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      PAPERS ON LABOR AND CAPITAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               NO. XVII.\r\n\r\nThe great object of a republican form of government is to arrive at that\r\ncondition wherein all the people constituting its citizens will stand\r\nupon a perfect equality in all things, which can be effected by\r\ngovernment. A government cannot determine that each citizen shall have\r\nequal capacity to apply and make use of the rights, privileges and\r\nimmunities which it guarantees to its people, but it can determine that\r\neach citizen shall have an equality of right to these benefits, the\r\nperfect attainment of which must rest with the citizen.\r\n\r\nThe question of Labor and Capital, as was said before, is included in\r\nthe greater and more important question of a Common Equality, or an\r\nequality which is predicated upon the fact that all mankind are\r\nbrethren. A republican form of government should find its fountain in\r\nthis fact, and all its causes should be governed by its deductions. All\r\nthe means of providing for the administration of the government, for its\r\nmaintenance and for the correction of any existing abuses, should be\r\nformulated with this one greatest of all human possibilities ever in\r\nview. Thus formulated, its practices would ever tend to bring all the\r\npeople into a comprehension of it, which comprehension is now scarcely\r\nexistent except in meaningless words, which are dealt from pharisaical\r\npulpits. In our last number the practice of protection to favored\r\ninterests was considered, with reference to its general effect upon\r\nother unfavored industries; the unequal working of the system of levying\r\nduties does not stop with generalities; it extends and touches a still\r\nmore vital point, and one which the people are more sensitive upon than\r\nalmost any other. The laying of specific duties upon imported goods and\r\nwares is an indirect way of _taxing_ that portion of the people who\r\nconsume such imported goods and wares. It not only makes it possible for\r\nthe protected interest to exist at the expense of other interests which\r\nconsume, but by this operation the government obtains revenue which is\r\nan indirect tax gathered from those who are compelled to pay the\r\nadvanced prices which the levying of duties implies. The amount obtained\r\nby such unequal and indirect methods of revenue for the last fiscal year\r\nwas the enormous sum of $194,448,427, every dollar of which was in\r\nreality but an additional tax drawn from the individuals who purchased\r\nsuch imported merchandise. This manner of levying taxes would not matter\r\nso much as a system of taxation did it fall equally upon the taxable\r\nproperty of the country, upon which general taxes are levied, but nearly\r\n$100,000,000 of the above sum was collected upon woolens, cottons,\r\nsugar, molasses, coffee and tea, of all of which the poorest in common\r\nwith the richest are almost equal consumers.\r\n\r\nLaborers of the United States! How like you this manner of filching your\r\nhard-earned dollars, under the specious, fraudulent name of “protection\r\nto home industries.” It is no wonder that your hard-earned wages will\r\nscarcely supply your families’ necessities, when you are compelled to\r\npay such a sum upon the most common staple articles of general\r\nconsumption. It is no wonder you are continuously laborers, never being\r\nable to become producers upon your own account, when you, who should\r\nnot, and, under general principles of taxation would not be called upon\r\nto pay a single dollar as a direct tax, are thus burdened.\r\n\r\nThus it will be seen that the levying of specific duties on imported\r\ngoods is a most unequal and iniquitous manner of taxing the poor\r\nlaboring classes of the country to support the government, which is\r\nadministered to all intents and purposes in the interests of the rich,\r\nand under which the really poor become poorer every year.\r\n\r\nNor are the other means to which the government resorts to support\r\nitself entitled to very much more consideration than that of the\r\nindirect one just mentioned. There is no equality to the general people\r\nin any of them; and it is quite evident that the whole system of revenue\r\nfor the support of the government should be remodeled, so as to fall\r\nwhere it should, in justice, upon the taxable property of the whole\r\nUnion. This done, and a sound financial system also inaugurated, the\r\nlower classes of society would begin to be leveled up to the medium, and\r\nthe upper classes to be leveled down to the same basis of material\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\nA system of taxation for the support of all government—town, city,\r\ncounty, state and national—should be formulated and inaugurated, based\r\nupon the proposition that all taxes should be general and none special.\r\nAll of these taxes, for the several purposes, should be assessed, levied\r\nand collected by one set of revenue officers, and thereby an immense\r\nsystem of economy introduced, whereby the collection of the revenues of\r\nthe country should not consume, by one-twentieth part, what is now\r\nconsumed in the almost innumerable methods which are adopted to obtain\r\nthe people’s money by indirect means. All of these subjects are for the\r\nlaboring classes to take up, examine, decide upon and rectify, and never\r\nwill they obtain the possibility of an equality until this is done.\r\nNever can equality be possible under the forms through which government\r\nis now administered and supported, and never will the laboring classes\r\nbecome independent of the wealthy classes until the freedom, equality\r\nand justice, which are the birthright of every citizen of the United\r\nStates, become possible of attainment under its government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    PAPERS ON FINANCE AND COMMERCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 NO. I.\r\n\r\nIn the following papers it will be our design to treat the questions of\r\nFinance and Commerce in a somewhat different manner from the ordinary\r\nand current way. The mere records of the transactions had in the world\r\nof money and of merchandise belong to the ordinary method of dealing\r\nwith all matters that interest the people. The facts—the results—only\r\nenter into the consideration, and if serious conflict or serious faults\r\nare recorded, no attention is paid to the sources from which they\r\nspring, and from which they will continue to spring so long as the\r\nsources furnish the causes. All subjects, and all parts of the common\r\ninterests of humanity, will receive from us not only the attention which\r\nthe present demands, but if the present brings unhappiness to humanity,\r\nor does not bring happiness, the fountains will be examined to discover\r\nwhere the stream takes on its bitterness and its sediment—and, for\r\ninstance, produces financial disease—with the view of exposing to the\r\npeople what causes their unhappiness or lack of happiness.\r\n\r\nAs society is constituted at present, nothing within its interests has\r\nso much power for good or ill as money. He that has it is independent—is\r\na free man; while he that has it not is dependent—a slave in some one or\r\nother of the forms of slavery. Men recognize that this is an imperfect\r\ncondition of society, made up, as it is of people born free and equal in\r\nthe eyes of the law, and by it entitled to their chosen path of\r\nhappiness. These being the birthright of every one, the construction of\r\nsociety should be such as to guarantee it to every one. As society\r\nimproves its condition, the advance made will be ever toward practical\r\nequality in all temporal things. It is the duty of those who labor in\r\nthe interests of society to lay hold of the future, and bring its\r\nconditions into the broadest present application.\r\n\r\nMoney being the corner-stone upon which society is now built, is thereby\r\nthat stone of all others which should be perfect, not only in form, but\r\nperfect in duration: that is, it should be of such composite elements\r\nthat time nor change should be able to produce any effect, either upon\r\nits external appearance or upon the arrangement of its parts. It becomes\r\napparent, then, at first observation from this standpoint, that our\r\npresent corner-stone is not one that can endure; it becomes plain that\r\nit not only will change, but that it should change, because of its\r\ncapability to meet the requirement of a perfect corner-stone, upon which\r\nsociety can rest with perfect and continuous security.\r\n\r\nGold has long been the accepted money standard of value. Intrinsically,\r\nit has no value other than for the other uses to which it is adapted,\r\nbut custom and long usage have raised it into the position of a god,\r\nbefore whom the world falls down and worships with as much devotion as\r\nPagans do before their various gods. And, considered as a god, none\r\nother has in this day and age one-half the power, nor is any other\r\nworshiped with one-half the devotion it is. This may be considered an\r\nunjust reflection upon the so-called Christians; but let them, as a\r\nclass, examine themselves individually, and if the analysis does not\r\nsustain the proposition, we shall be very willing to confess our error,\r\nand appeal for forgiveness. Gold _has_ been the accepted money standard,\r\nbut the practice, since the depreciation of our country’s credit, has,\r\nto all intents and purposes, reduced it to a mere commodity. Our money\r\nis not measured by Gold—Gold is measured by it. It may be said that this\r\nis merely for temporary convenience, but nevertheless it is so measured,\r\nand the practice has demonstrated that so far as facilitating exchange\r\nof products in our own country is concerned, its use might be dispensed\r\nwith. If it can be dispensed with and trade continue, its importance as\r\nmoney entirely disappears. Would dispensing with its use offer any\r\nimpediments to commerce with other countries? But this article is simply\r\nintroductory, intended rather to indicate what our treatment of finance\r\nwill be, than for the discussion of any of the questions that arise\r\nunder it. These will remain for future consideration; here we will\r\nsimply state that we do not believe gold to be a true standard of value;\r\nthat we do not believe its use as money is at all necessary; that we do\r\nnot believe that its use as money contributes to general prosperity; and\r\nthat we do believe that its use will be supplanted by a new medium—the\r\ntrue representative of that portion of the real wealth of the country\r\nwhich is at the given time in the process of exchange.\r\n\r\n NEW YORK, August 25, 1870.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    PAPERS ON FINANCE AND COMMERCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                NO. II.\r\n\r\nFinance and commerce are so intimately connected that one cannot be\r\ntreated without the other being, at least, indirectly alluded to. If\r\nthese terms are analyzed, their relations will be perfectly understood.\r\nCommerce is the simple exchange of something one individual possesses\r\nfor something another individual is possessed of. This exchange may be\r\nbetween neighbors, or between nations; it is all commerce. In ancient\r\ntimes, articles of merchandise were exchanged for articles of\r\nmerchandise, but as commerce increased in amount, and its limits became\r\nextended, it became necessary to make use of something that should\r\nrepresent value, so that there need not, in all cases, be an actual\r\ntransfer of property for property. The medium used to facilitate these\r\nexchanges was money in its first phases, and out of this necessity have\r\ngrown all the different monetary devices made use of, at various times,\r\nin the history of civilization.\r\n\r\nTo demonstrate that money is only a convenience and not an absolute\r\nnecessity, any one has only to observe that frequent purchases, sales\r\nand payments are made without the use of money or any other\r\nrepresentative of value, but by the direct transfer of value for value.\r\nIt is plain, then, that money, be it gold, silver or what else it may,\r\nif not intrinsically of the value set upon it, but that it represents\r\nsomething that has intrinsic value. If this is questioned, let any one\r\nwho doubts it procure some gold in its original state and endeavor to\r\nmake exchanges with it. He will find that no one will receive it, even\r\nat its value by weight. Were he to apply to a dozen places where gold,\r\nin mass, is dealt in, he would be offered a dozen different prices for\r\nhis article. It is only after gold has passed through the hands of the\r\ngovernment, and has received its impress as an indorsement, that it\r\nbecomes current as money.\r\n\r\nIt is further to be observed that the time came when even coin became\r\ntoo burdensome to be directly transferred in making exchanges, and\r\nsomething representing it was brought into use. This consisted of bits\r\nof paper, containing upon them promises to pay so much in coin, &c.,\r\n&c.; and under this practice banks of issue sprung into existence, their\r\nissues being supposed to represent a gold or coin basis of value. But a\r\nfull representation alone of coin deposited was found not to supply a\r\nsufficient circulating medium to accommodate the movement of produce,\r\nand for other uses, and it became customary for the banks to expand\r\ntheir issues beyond the amount of coin on hand, upon the supposition\r\nthat these promises to pay would never be presented in sufficient\r\nquantities to consume their actual specie. But suppositions are only\r\ntrue _generally_, and hence it came that promises to pay often exhausted\r\nthe ability to pay, and here began the ills that must necessarily attend\r\na false standard of values.\r\n\r\nIn all seasons of financial distress, gold, as a standard, has failed.\r\nThe necessities of our late war demonstrated and represented the fallacy\r\nof an absolute standard in gold, and happily suggested a better\r\nstandard. No sooner did the supply of gold at the command of the\r\ngovernment fail, than the latter was compelled to resort to its credit,\r\nor to a direct representation of the true value and wealth of the\r\ncountry. The credit of the government was the ability and intention of\r\nthe country to meet the promises of its government, and this ability\r\ndetermined its currency. It was not the amount of gold, absolutely, that\r\nthe country was supposed capable of acquiring that thus entered into\r\nconsideration, but the ability of the country to produce certain\r\nquantities of merchandise, which should, in time, be sufficient, above\r\nconsumption, to balance these promises to pay. It was the productive\r\ncapacity of this country that gave value to its currency and bonds\r\nirrespective of gold. The productive capacity of a country is then the\r\nvirtual standard of the value of its currency, and as gold can only be\r\nobtained by the products of the country, its necessity as a medium may\r\nbe dispensed with. It is now predicted that the sooner gold, as the\r\nmoney god, is dethroned in the hearts and customs of the people, the\r\nsooner a sound and perfect system of finance will be inaugurated.\r\n\r\nThat there is a true standard of value, and one that can never fail in\r\ntime of need, nor be made use of for speculative purposes as gold is,\r\nmust be apparent to every thinking mind. How many of the people of this\r\ncountry, during the last eight years, have received gold or silver for\r\nwhat they have disposed of, or have used it to purchase their\r\nnecessities? And yet the talk of a return to specie payment is\r\neverywhere heard. When will the idol worship of the god of gold be\r\ncompletely abolished?\r\n\r\n NEW YORK, August 31, 1870.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    PAPERS ON FINANCE AND COMMERCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                NO. III.\r\n\r\nWe have said that there is a true standard of value, and that this is\r\nbased in the capacity of a country to pay without infringing upon the\r\ncountry itself; that is, without resorting to an actual transfer of\r\nsupposed title to any part of its domain for something the domain itself\r\nproduced. Actual ownership in the soil of a country is an assumption, as\r\nhas been stated in the “Papers on Labor and Capital.” If the title to\r\nany real estate is traced back far enough, it would be found to have\r\noriginated in the practice of “Squatter Sovereignty.” The inhabitants of\r\na country having the right to make use of the land they occupy, render\r\nit more or less valuable, according to the amount they can make it\r\nproduce, whether it be in the shape of its natural products or those of\r\nartificial assistance, or whether it is simply occupied for purposes\r\nother than production.\r\n\r\nThe basis, however, of the value is in the productions of the soil of a\r\ncountry; it matters not how much value may be added by the art of man to\r\nwhat nature furnishes. This would find no scope for action did the earth\r\nnot first yield the fruits of her bosom to the hand of the artist. The\r\nfinest cloth, the most delicate silks and laces, the most costly jewels,\r\neven the light that robs night of its darkness, are all primarily the\r\nproducts of the earth. Without this yielding of the earth there would be\r\nnothing. This giving up of the earth to the demands, efforts and desires\r\nof man, is the process by which he acquires all his wealth. Even the\r\ngold that has so long been called money the earth has yielded, and still\r\nyields. When this is considered in its true light, we come to a\r\nrealization that gold is no more money, absolutely, than any other of\r\nthe different products of the earth, but with them all it forms the real\r\nvalue standard. Gold is relatively valuable for the general uses it can\r\nbe made to subserve; so, too, and only so, are all other products. Any\r\nother metal might just as well have been selected out of which to coin\r\nmoney as gold. It no longer answers the purpose it has been used for so\r\nlong. It is not “radical” enough to suit “the times.” It is one of the\r\nlandmarks of conservatism, reminding us that once it required at least\r\nsix months to communicate with, and receive an answer from, London,\r\nwhereas we now know the 5 o’clock P. M. closing prices of stocks in\r\nLondon at 1 o’clock of the same day.\r\n\r\nSuch annihilation of time and space is entirely ahead of, and above, the\r\nera of gold, which must yield its sway to something more elastic, and\r\nconsequently possible of better adaptation to the constantly varying\r\nrequirements of the peoples. The world having been so long held in\r\nfinancial bondage to gold, is now approaching a period wherein it will\r\nrid itself of the yoke. A very few people in the world rule it. What of\r\nthe thrones of Europe without the Rothschilds? and what of them if not\r\nfor gold? The vast debts of those countries alone render crowns longer\r\nendurable. Just a little more intelligence among the common people—just\r\na few more newspapers and readers, and the work is done; those who play\r\nking, and they who are the real kings, will fall together. Kings rule\r\nthe people, but money rules kings. This is beginning to be realized, and\r\nthe realization is not satisfactory to those who produce wealth; they do\r\nnot care to live under the tyranny of a god they themselves have\r\nfashioned. But after gold, what?\r\n\r\n NEW YORK, Sept 7, 1870.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    PAPERS ON FINANCE AND COMMERCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                NO. IV.\r\n\r\nIf gold, as a medium of exchange, is behind the requirements of the\r\ntimes—and that it is has been pretty fully demonstrated—some reform\r\nshould be instituted to supply the failure; some reform—not merely to\r\nmeet the exigencies of present time and circumstances—which should be\r\ninaugurated as a permanent change.\r\n\r\nOur government, during the last war, was obliged to resort to what was\r\nconsidered then by nearly all people, and is still considered by many\r\npeople, as very extreme measures, in order to furnish the material by\r\nwhich the war might be carried on. Without the greenbacks we never could\r\nhave succeeded as we did. To the person who conceived this project we\r\nare as greatly indebted as to our generals, who successfully prosecuted\r\nthe war upon the means furnished through his financial foresight. This\r\nwas one means of resorting to the credit of the country. If the credit\r\nof the country was sufficiently good to furnish it with the means to\r\ncarry on such an exhaustive war as ours was, it surely should be good\r\nfor any peaceful time.\r\n\r\nFor our part, we cannot see the propriety of returning to specie\r\npayment; and there is one insuperable objection to it. Gold cannot\r\nfurnish the circulating medium for the world, and credit must be\r\nresorted to; and the necessity of having two kinds of circulation\r\ninvolves difficulties which the mercantile world would be glad to have\r\nforever done with.\r\n\r\nWhy should people be obliged to use one kind of circulating medium to\r\npurchase another kind with, and then use this second kind to pay his\r\ndebts to another party, who will sell it again to obtain what the first\r\nperson used to purchase it? This is the logic of specie payments. If it\r\nis argued that the actual transfer of the gold is not necessary, we\r\nwould then ask why is specie payment desirable at all? The facts\r\nregarding this question are that people have become wedded to the idea\r\nthat gold is the only possible thing that can be made money, while all\r\ntheir practice has been that it is the least entitled to the name of\r\nmoney of anything they have ever used as such.\r\n\r\nAs has been said, the real standard value of a country is its capacity\r\nto produce, and it is this production that requires to be moved,\r\nexchanged, bartered or sold. The use of something to represent this, for\r\nwhich it can stand responsible in general terms, is what is required of\r\nmoney. That kind of money which will best meet all these requirements is\r\nthe best money. That kind of money which has elasticity, that will be\r\nplenty when business is active, and that can be readily put to other use\r\nfor profit when business is less demanding, is the kind the prosperity\r\nof a country demands. With a money of this kind, all financial crises\r\nwould be impossible. It is the possibility of making a stringent market\r\nthat unsettles financial matters and causes financial destruction. And\r\nit is because we have not a financial system of our own that it is\r\npossible for exigencies in other countries to unsettle values here.\r\nTo-day, the price of our securities in London determines the price of\r\ngold here. In view of the possible complications in which Europe is\r\nliable to be involved any time, and which she must within a very few\r\nyears be involved in, it becomes a matter of considerable moment,\r\nwhether our finances are to be governed and guided by the condition of\r\nthings there, when these things shall come.\r\n\r\nAs a nation we are or can be, were it necessary, independent of the\r\nworld, and are the first and best representative of a republican form of\r\ngovernment. Why should we not be the nation to give to the world a\r\nreformed currency? The world—or that part of it which has grown to\r\nappreciate our kind of freedom—involuntarily turns its eyes to us for\r\npatterns of all things that a people during a change of government\r\nrequire. One of the first things a government requires is money. Why\r\nshall we not show the nations how to make the best use of their means,\r\nand give them a system that will do more for them than any system that\r\nhas yet been tried, and by so doing also meet our own needs?\r\n\r\nThe capability to do this would instantly place us at the head of\r\nnations, and financially to stand thus, is to complete the measure of\r\nour greatness. Politically, we can never be subdued. During our late war\r\nthere were two millions of men under arms. Just in this proportion,\r\nalso, should we be powerful financially, and to become so would be to be\r\nallotted by the world the lead of it and all its nations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    PAPERS ON FINANCE AND COMMERCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 NO. V.\r\n\r\nThe gravest of all questions of political economy is that of a country’s\r\nmoney. A very great deal more of the people’s common happiness depends\r\nupon money than even political economists generally suppose. Happiness\r\nis very closely allied to prosperity, and general prosperity in a\r\ncountry can never obtain unless it is under a sound financial system.\r\nVery few people understand what general prosperity means. It does not\r\nmean vast sums of gold in the hands of a few of the inhabitants of the\r\ncountry, while the great majority struggle month after month for the\r\nabsolute necessities of life. There may be a great deal of money in a\r\ncountry and still be very little general prosperity with the common\r\npeople. The question of money has never been considered philosophically,\r\nnor with due regard to the common interests of humanity. It is always\r\nviewed from the standpoint of the wealthy, and usually by the wealthy or\r\nby those in their direct interests.\r\n\r\nThe producing classes, however, are beginning to awake to the fact that\r\nthey have never been represented in any of the legislation that has been\r\nhad regarding finance and the currency they have been forced to use. On\r\nthe contrary, they perceive that all legislation has been in the\r\ninterests of capital, and this perception is what is arraying these\r\nsupposed two interests against each other. The facts existing have only\r\nto be considered to prove that our financial system is unsound, and this\r\nshould be sufficient to force our legislation to take up the question,\r\nand to handle it in the light of the demands of the present, utterly\r\nregardless of the superstition that has so long existed about the gold\r\nidol.\r\n\r\nThe objectors to any thing as money but gold, make much of the need of\r\nit to make good the balances of trade between different countries. But\r\nthese forget that gold is nothing but merchandise until the country has\r\nplaced its indorsement upon it, and that it is this which gives it the\r\ncharacter of money, and that it does not derive this character from the\r\nfact that it is gold. The indorsement of a country upon gold coin is a\r\nsimple guarantee that it is of a specific purity, after this, its value\r\nis determined by its weight. Thus gold sent to other countries to pay\r\nbalances against us, is sent and received, as so much by weight of a\r\nspecific quality of gold, and not as so much of our national money. The\r\nforce of this objection, then, is utterly destroyed by these\r\nconsiderations; and especially so, when this same gold, coined by our\r\ngovernment, is recoined by the country we send it to. Here it is\r\ndistinctly proved that gold is not money, and that it is only a\r\ncommodity which we produce and part with in exchange for other\r\ncommodities, and that it is just as valuable for this purpose if it goes\r\ndirect from the mines where we produce it, to other countries, as it is\r\nif it goes by the way of a United States Mint, where it receives the\r\nindorsement of the government.\r\n\r\nTo go still deeper, there is a no more mischievous idea than that all\r\npaper money should be redeemable in gold which should alone be\r\nlegal-tender, because everybody knows that the amount of currency this\r\ncountry demands cannot by any possibility ever be redeemed by gold. It\r\nmay be redeemed by using the same gold coin over and over again, as it\r\nis again and again received and paid; but just here is the difficulty;\r\nfor ten dollars of currency in reality have to be redeemed by the one\r\ngold dollar. This is the _practice_ of specie payments, and a most\r\nmischievous one it is, too; it is the sole idea that leads to great\r\ninflations, and consequently to great collapses in finances and values.\r\nUnder this system there never was nor never can be a reliable mercantile\r\nvalue to anything. Fluctuation is its direct result, while speculation,\r\nwithout this, would cease, and the vast horde of mere speculators who\r\nspend their whole time in it, would of necessity be compelled to become\r\nproducers of some kind. It will thus be seen that the first principles\r\nof economy are in direct opposition to the results coming from the use\r\nof gold as money; and that these declare that something should supersede\r\nits use as such that it would be impossible to speculate upon; something\r\nthat would have such absolute and never varying value as could be\r\npositively counted upon to endure a month, a year, a century or a\r\nthousand years, as the cases in question should respectively involve.\r\nSuch a substantial thing might with propriety be called money, and in\r\ncomparison to it gold would sink into utter insignificance and be\r\nforgotten.\r\n\r\n NEW YORK, September 14, 1870.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    PAPERS ON FINANCE AND COMMERCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                NO. VI.\r\n\r\nA very fallacious argument has been the rule, because gold has been\r\nconsidered “money,” that all currency is “credit;” this at first blush\r\nwould seem to be still further strengthened by the proposition that gold\r\nis only merchandise. By no means, however, is all currency credit. All\r\nbank currency is credit. All currency that is not legal-tender for\r\ncontracts and debts is credit; but a currency which is of itself\r\nlegal-tender is money, because it is itself intrinsically valuable. All\r\nthe uses one has for money it fills; it not only meets all demands that\r\n“credit currency” can meet, but it fills other and specific demands that\r\nbank currency cannot. It is receivable for nearly all governmental\r\ndemands upon the people; it pays taxes, and cannot be refused by any one\r\nin payment of contracts and obligations. Such a currency has all the\r\nfeatures and characteristics of money, except that in our practice it\r\nhas not been receivable for duties upon imports. Had greenbacks been\r\nmade legal-tender for all governmental purposes, they would have been\r\n“real money,” having intrinsic value, of which nothing short of the\r\nabsolute destruction of the country and death of its inhabitants could\r\nhave robbed them. The gold fallacy, however, prevented Congress from\r\nseeing the real drift of what they did, and the country, therefore, must\r\nyet a little longer be blinded by the thought that gold is the only\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nThe only argument which is at all tenable, that converts anything that\r\nhas all the qualities of merchandise into a measure of value is, that\r\nthe article thus rendered costs at all times, and in all countries, the\r\nsame labor to produce it. This test, every one knows, is not applicable\r\nto any single thing the earth yields; and as little as to any other does\r\nit attach to gold, and, therefore, gold in itself is subject to\r\nfluctuation, and can in no sense be considered an absolute measure of\r\nanything. This country, since California began to yield her gold, has\r\nbeen a great producer of the precious metal; that is, a certain amount\r\nof labor has produced a larger proportionate quantity of it than has\r\ngenerally been produced in this or in other countries; consequently we\r\nhave been large exporters, not of money, but of gold, in its character\r\nas merchandise: very much of this has been exported in mass, uncoined,\r\nin which condition not even the most rigid gold stickler will pretend it\r\nis money.\r\n\r\nHence it follows that we do not need “money” to balance our accounts\r\nwith other countries; we need particular kinds of merchandise which we\r\nhave in larger quantities than we have use for, or which other countries\r\nneed more than they do some merchandise they have which we require more\r\nthan they do; which system brings about exchange, the sum total of which\r\nis commerce. If commerce were left to regulate itself without any\r\ninterference to prevent the natural flow and reflux of the products of\r\nthe earth, as stated above, there would soon become established\r\npermanent courses for certain products, to take which would still\r\nfurther localize all kinds of labor, and render each of nearly unvarying\r\nprofit. It is this interference with the natural demand and supply of\r\nthe various parts and peoples of the earth that breaks down the\r\nequilibrium of labor, and makes possible the extreme unequal\r\ndistribution of wealth.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that all questions of finance and commerce are\r\nintimately connected, while those of labor and capital grow out of the\r\nconditions they make possible and inevitable. To properly understand the\r\nrelations of capital and labor, and to harmonize them, demands a correct\r\ncomprehension of the basic principles of economy which relate to finance\r\nand commerce. If these were based in correct universal principles, there\r\ncould be no questions to settle between labor and capital. Hence it is\r\nthat it becomes specially requisite at this time, when labor is rising\r\nto a sense of the unjust position it is confined to, that these\r\nquestions of finance should be agitated as the most important ones for\r\nadjustment. To begin at the root of the evil is the philosophic way to\r\ndeal with all the ills of society as it is with all ills which result in\r\nthe gradual evolution of all departments of the universe.\r\n\r\nFor a measure of value and to aid exchanges, then, there is required a\r\ncurrency, or medium, that does not possess any of the characteristics of\r\nmerchandise, that is not a commodity nor a product in any sense of those\r\nterms, but something that has intrinsic value of itself, being a true\r\nrepresentative of value, and of equal and absolute value at all times\r\nand under all circumstances and changes. Such a thing would be money,\r\nand anything not possessing these requirements is not worthy the name of\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nThe question arises, then, Can there be anything formulated or brought\r\ninto use that would possess all these requirements under all\r\ncircumstances? It is quite certain that there never has been, as yet,\r\nanything used as money that was as absolute as a dollar, as a pound is\r\nas a pound, or as a foot is as a foot. A pound is just a pound under any\r\nand all circumstances; so, too, is a foot under the same; and so is a\r\ngallon, and so is a cord of wood; whether a greater or less number of\r\nany of them are required at one time or another for use, they are always\r\na pound, a foot, a gallon, or a cord, and no more nor no less. Now, what\r\nwe require is a measure of values of just as fixed and absolute a\r\ncharacter as any of these. When this is acquired, then just as unvarying\r\nvalue will attach to the measure of values as there does to those\r\nmeasures. Money is but another name for values, and the dollar is one of\r\nthe divisions of its measures. There is no more reason why money should\r\nfluctuate in its capacity of measuring or of being measured than there\r\nis that the foot should grow longer or shorter, or the pound greater or\r\nless, and there is just the same reason why it should not.\r\n\r\nThen, the products of the earth once placed upon this unvarying\r\nstandard, the cost of producing each different product would determine\r\nits exact value, and in time the producers of each kind would be upon an\r\nexact equality in regard to the value of their products. It is the\r\nattaching, in practice, of absolute value to something that can have no\r\nabsolute value which makes possible all the various degrees of poverty\r\nthat belong to the laboring or producing classes. If these inequalities\r\nare to be remedied, there is but one method by which it can be done—that\r\nis, to reduce our money systems to the same fixedness that we have\r\nreduced all our other systems to. This once done, all labor will\r\ngravitate to an equality, and capital will become its best ally instead\r\nof, as now, its apparent enemy, while each of these interests, and all\r\ndivisions of each of them, everywhere in the world, would become mutual,\r\nand by so being would prepare the way and lay the foundation for that\r\ngrand harmonization of society which must precede the practical\r\nco-operation of mankind, as brethren, under a universal unitary\r\ngovernment of the United States of the World.\r\n\r\n NEW YORK, Sept. 20, 1870.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    PAPERS ON FINANCE AND COMMERCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                NO. VII.\r\n\r\nThe point has now been arrived at where it is to be considered as\r\ndecided that gold is not, cannot, be money; that it is a valuable\r\narticle of merchandise. Its utility beyond this character has not only\r\ndeparted as a principle, but in practice a very considerable portion of\r\nthe most enlightened people in the world consider it the source of great\r\nmischief, and the more the causes of the financial ills we are subjected\r\nto are analyzed, the more they will be found to be dependent upon the\r\nattaching of a specific value to something that is as changeable in cost\r\nof production as it is possible for anything to be.\r\n\r\nThe philosopher and the best reformer would here step in and say that it\r\nis their province not so much to tear down the old as it is to prepare\r\nthe new that shall take the place of the old. This is the science of all\r\nreform. However, before there can be a field prepared in which the new\r\ncan be used, the defunct condition of the old must be pointed out, and\r\nits _debris_ cleared away, so that the new may find space for operation.\r\n\r\nThis preparation has in reality been already made. The necessities of\r\nthe Government in the late war broke the first ground for the\r\nconsideration of this very important question, and prepared the minds of\r\nthe mass of the people, though, perhaps, unconsciously, for the\r\nreception of the idea that it is possible to do without gold; that\r\nspecie payment is by no means a necessary accompaniment of a sound\r\nfinancial condition, and that a money system which is made dependent\r\nupon a redemption by something else, is not only not to be desired, but\r\nthat it is the real foundation for all financial disasters, because it\r\nmakes an undue expansion possible. The people who would once have\r\nconsidered a proposition for an irredeemable currency with the utmost\r\nalarm now discuss it as one of the things that is sure to be. It is\r\nbelieved by those who have studied this subject deepest that the time\r\nhas arrived when this government must enter upon the consideration of a\r\npermanent change in our financial system, and that a return to the gold\r\nstandard would be a disaster.\r\n\r\nBut, says the objector, how can an irredeemable currency ever be made to\r\nadapt itself to the varied demands of the country? How can anything so\r\nunsubstantial as a paper currency, without gold support, be made as\r\nabsolute a measure of values as the yard-stick is of distance? and, if\r\nthis can be accomplished, where will the elasticity of the currency be\r\nfound? In general terms it is assumed that, unless the proposed\r\nfinancial system will answer all these conditions—that unless it will be\r\nelastic, adapting itself to all the demands that can be made, be they\r\ngreat or small, and at the same time remain absolute in its value, it is\r\nnot even fit to be thought of, much less to be seriously considered as a\r\nsubstitute for what has been.\r\n\r\nAnd this brings us back to the beginning of the argument—to the point\r\nfrom which the first departure was made. The course that will be\r\npursued, however, after leaving this point this time will not be that of\r\nreconnoitring—looking over—the ground to be covered, but a steady, firm\r\nand final advance directly toward the objective result desired, which,\r\nif a failure is made in reaching, the campaign against gold may be\r\nconsidered a failure. Under the system of currency being good only when\r\nit can be redeemed by gold, there is required, to make the currency\r\nactually in circulation good, just as many gold dollars as there are\r\ncurrency dollars—that is, if there is at any time in circulation any\r\nmore currency than there is gold to redeem it, then there is an\r\nexpansion, which any sudden change in any of the circumstances by which\r\nnations are surrounded is liable to convert into a collapse. So long as\r\neverything is prosperous, so long as nothing arises to shake the\r\nconfidence of the people, or to call the attention of any considerable\r\nnumber to the possibility that there is not gold enough to redeem all\r\nthe currency that is in circulation, so long everything goes well; but\r\nso soon as any one of said conditions occur or change, then there is a\r\nrush to see who shall get what gold there is; the supply exhausted, the\r\nunredeemed currency is valueless. This is the practice and the result of\r\na redeemable currency; the same results will also follow so long as such\r\na system is tolerated.\r\n\r\nEverybody knows that there never has been a currency in circulation\r\nsufficient in quantity to meet all the requirements of commerce that had\r\na complete basis in gold, and everybody also knows that there is not\r\ngold enough in the world to meet this specific requirement. Hence it is\r\nthat institutions possessing, say $100,000 in gold, put forth and obtain\r\ninterest upon $500,000 in currency—that is to say, with a real capital\r\nof $100,000, which is worth six per cent. interest, they really obtain\r\nthirty per cent. interest, thus making it possible for them to double\r\ntheir original capital every three or four years. Did those who now so\r\nloudly complain of the National Banks receiving interest from the\r\ngovernment upon their bonds deposited, and from the people upon their\r\ncirculation, ever object to the greater enormities of the specie-paying\r\nbanks?\r\n\r\nThe only use of money is to facilitate exchanges of what the earth\r\nproduces, voluntarily or under compulsion. Money, then, has its direct\r\nrelation to these products as a whole, and can have no special relation\r\nto any part of them; if made to enter upon and sustain any such special\r\nrelation, it is a purely arbitrary law, without foundation in principle,\r\nthat compels it, and all arbitrary laws belong to the ages past, when\r\nbrute force was required to guide ignorance; they cannot be long in this\r\nage without generating irritation, and such irritation is now being\r\nrapidly developed all over the world, wherever the laboring classes have\r\nbecome at all advanced in knowledge. The few can no longer control the\r\nmany; the many are to control the few. Capital, through false systems of\r\nvalues, has been able to control labor; but the time has nearly come\r\nwhen the producing many will control the accumulated wealth of the world\r\nfor the benefit of the whole world—not simply and only because they are\r\nthe many, but because they are to be reinforced by the invincible powers\r\nof demonstrated science, which are always to be found operating for the\r\n“greatest good for the greatest number.”\r\n\r\n NEW YORK, Sept. 27, 1870.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    PAPERS ON FINANCE AND COMMERCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               NO. VIII.\r\n\r\nMoney was invented as a method to facilitate the exchanges of the\r\nproducts of the industry of the world. If this is a true definition of\r\nmoney, the only legitimate money it is possible to have is something\r\nthat naturally grows out of the uses it is required for. A national\r\ncurrency, then, should be a representative of that which it is its\r\nsphere to exchange; that is to say: a currency dollar should stand for a\r\ncertain amount of the different products, which have been produced at\r\nthe expense of a certain amount of labor. It will be perceived that this\r\nrepresentation is upon an entirely different hypothesis from that of a\r\ncurrency which is supposed to represent gold.\r\n\r\nTo begin with something which everybody can understand: It may be\r\nsupposed that a farmer, occupying a given quantity of land, can, in a\r\nseries of ten years, produce an average amount of ten thousand dollars\r\nper year to dispose of commercially. During the process of production he\r\nis obliged to have, say, eight thousand dollars’ worth of means to\r\nenable him to continue the process. Now, instead of his being obliged to\r\nobtain credit based upon his prospective crop, he is supplied with a\r\nrepresentative currency based upon it; this enables him to purchase from\r\ntime to time that which he requires. When his crop is harvested, it is\r\ndisposed of, and his currency is _redeemed_ by it.\r\n\r\nNow, make this application general to all kinds of production in the\r\ncountry—which is the only basis of value a country can have—and make the\r\ngovernment the appraiser of the value thereof, and the maker and utterer\r\nof its representative, and a currency will be obtained that will possess\r\nall the requirements and characteristics of money; because it will be\r\nused to exchange that upon which it is based and of which it is\r\nrepresentative, and which is substantially redeemed every time it\r\nexchanges any products of the country.\r\n\r\nNow, how shall this system be instituted? In the census now being taken,\r\nthe value of the total products of the country can be arrived at, which\r\nsum total should be used as the basis of issue, and continue as such\r\nduring the next _ten years_, at the end of which time the increased\r\nproducts would require another valuation to amend the bases for an\r\nincreased issue for the next ten years.\r\n\r\nA currency thus obtained would possess all the substantial value that\r\ncould be required of money. It is really the basis of value when gold is\r\nused; for how are a people to obtain gold unless they have produce to\r\nexchange for it?—which operation is, in reality, nothing more than the\r\nexchange of one commodity for another, of which it is not and cannot be\r\nrepresentative, while in the case of the proposed currency an exchange\r\nis effected for that of which it is representative.\r\n\r\nIn this view of currency for a country, our system of greenbacks come\r\nnearer being money than anything that has ever been in use in this or in\r\nany other country. They were based upon the capacity of the country to\r\nproduce, and had the government confined itself to their use, and had\r\nnot been obliged to invent some further means to predicate securities,\r\nwe should now have had a real money currency. Who is there to find fault\r\nwith “greenbacks” as a national currency, provided there are enough of\r\nthem to transact the business of the country with, _and no more than\r\njust enough_? But they lack one essential quality of real money—they are\r\nnot receivable for all things that people need money for, and which the\r\ngovernment demands of the people. They should have been made receivable\r\nfor all government demands, _even for duties on imports_. But the\r\nnecessities of the government, which was then struggling with all its\r\nmight for existence, made it a “military necessity” to exact gold for\r\nduties on imports, as an indirect way of taxing the people who could\r\nafford to indulge in the luxuries of foreign products.\r\n\r\nThough not available for duties there never has been in the history of\r\nthe world so stable and invariable a measure of value as the greenbacks,\r\nsince government ceased issuing any more than the amount already out.\r\nThere has been no great financial panic and no considerable unsettling\r\nof commercial values. They require that one thing more should be\r\ndone—they should be given a _fixed measure of value_. Then nothing more\r\ncould be required of a currency than would be found in the greenbacks.\r\n\r\nThe reason, and the only reason, why the people can feel that such a\r\ncurrency may be unstable is the fear that the government may be induced\r\nto issue it in greater amount than primarily authorized, and\r\nconsequently that it would depreciate; but this could not be until the\r\nnation should issue more than the value of its property. But for this\r\ndeficiency there is a good and sufficient remedy, which can be provided\r\nand used in connection with the proposed new currency, which is to be\r\nbased upon the capacity of the country for production, and which will\r\nalso provide for different seasons or parts of seasons when more or less\r\ncirculating medium is demanded to fulfill the business indications of\r\nthe country; and with this it is believed all the objections are covered\r\nthat can possibly be raised by the most strenuous stickler for a\r\ncurrency with a gold basis, though the government may issue never so\r\ngreat a volume of the currency proposed.\r\n\r\n NEW YORK, Oct. 3, 1870.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    PAPERS ON FINANCE AND COMMERCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                NO. IX.\r\n\r\nThere are several propositions which should always remain in all\r\nconsiderations about money, so that the mind may not be led from its\r\ntrue sphere, and so that it may not be invested with peculiarities and\r\ncharacteristics that never did nor never can belong to money:\r\n\r\n_First_ and most important—most important because it is the determining\r\npoint which gives all that follows tangibility—is, that _money, in its\r\nprimary uses, is a means and not an end_. It is a means, because it was\r\ninvented to assist the people in performing something that could be\r\nperformed without, but not so well without it. And this is the _sole\r\nuse_ of money. Because this has been lost sight of and it has been\r\ninvested with other functions, it has been possible for it to be\r\nconverted to uses which at times, in culminating, have almost turned the\r\nworld topsy-turvy.\r\n\r\n_Second._ Money is the medium of exchanging commodities, and when\r\ndiverted from its legitimate use and is made an end, results will ever\r\nfollow which _must_ be detrimental to the general interests involved.\r\n\r\n_Third._ All the material value money possesses is so possessed because\r\nof the relation it bears to commodities, that relation being\r\nrepresentative of or standing for.\r\n\r\n_Fourth._ While money is the medium of exchanges, and while it is in use\r\nrepresentative of valuable materials, it is in its _last_ analysis the\r\n_objective_ of that department of life of which labor is the\r\n_subjective_, and, therefore, when scientifically viewed, it resolves\r\nitself into a principal which is one of those upon which society must be\r\nbuilt when a perfect foundation is formulated.\r\n\r\nIn providing a currency, therefore, to meet the uses which are demanded\r\nof it, its _scientific_ feature, as a principle, should be the point of\r\ndeparture, and should be the only guide until it is attained. Labor\r\nbeing the basis of production, is the positive power which reaches forth\r\nand expends itself, where money, the other pole of the social battery,\r\nis reached; this reaction upon labor completes the circuit, and here is\r\nthe process which is continually going on: A certain amount of labor—a\r\npositive power—produces a certain amount of money or negative result The\r\ninterference with this natural process by extraneous means, through\r\nwhich undue quantities of negative forces are accumulated, is that\r\nprocess which robs labor of its natural and, therefore, just results.\r\n\r\nThe labor which the people of this country are capable of performing,\r\nthen, is the real basis upon which money should be formulated, and, as\r\nin practice, the results generally are annual in their return, this\r\nbasis should be measured by all they can produce annually. It follows\r\nthat the basis upon which money should be uttered is this annual\r\ncapacity of labor, and there should be sufficient uttered to completely\r\nmeasure this capacity, between which two, when once established, there\r\nwould be an equilibrium produced, which would only require to be\r\npermanently regulated and maintained to insure a perfect harmony in the\r\nmaterial interests of society.\r\n\r\nFor example, let it be supposed that the extremest legitimate amount of\r\ncurrency that would be warranted under the previous rule is one billion\r\nof dollars; and that this amount is all that the uses of money require\r\nwhen there is the largest amount of business being transacted. It must\r\nbe remembered that this is not a redeemable currency, but that it is\r\nmoney; that it is the representative of the wealth of the nation, and\r\nthat the government, as the head of the nation, has uttered it, upon the\r\nsoundest and best basis of value any money could possibly have—the\r\nproductive capacity of the country. In this money system there could be\r\nno such thing as the failure of banks to redeem their issues; nor of any\r\nloss to be sustained by the individual because of the mismanagement of\r\nany board of directors; and what is more than all the rest, in the\r\npresent systems of society, its value would be sustained by the\r\ncollective accumulated wealth of the whole country, and it could by no\r\npossibility depreciate in value so long as the value of the country was\r\nnot exceeded by the amount of the issue.\r\n\r\nTo guard the people against all apprehension of such a result ever being\r\npossible, there should be a measure placed upon this currency that will\r\nat all times make it just as absolute in its measure of value as the\r\npound is in its measure of weight, or as inches are in their measure of\r\ndistances. Though this is comparatively a new proposition, and one that\r\nbut very few minds think a possibility, it nevertheless is just as\r\npossible and just as essential—and more so—as all other absolute and\r\narbitrary standards are, that have been invented to give regularity and\r\nstability in their respective spheres of use.\r\n\r\nThis currency—this money—should be made convertible into a United States\r\nBond, which should bear such a rate of interest—say four per cent.—as\r\nexperience has or should demonstrate to be the true point of balance;\r\nand the bond should also be convertible into the currency at the option\r\nof the holder. The rate of interest should be open to readjustment every\r\nten years, when the estimates for the currency are made. Thus it would\r\ncome that whenever there should be so much currency in circulation that\r\nit would be worth less than four per cent. for business uses, the\r\nsurplus would immediately be converted into four per cent. bonds; and\r\nwhenever money for business should be worth more than four per cent.,\r\nthe bonds would be converted into the currency in just sufficient\r\nquantities to meet the demand and to restore the equilibrium.\r\n\r\nIt will be readily seen how perfectly this meets all the requirements of\r\nmoney, and how perfectly all the irregularities of demand and supply are\r\nmet by it. Thus, when business is dull, and but little money is\r\nrequired, it (the surplus) will be in bonds drawing four per cent.\r\ninterest; the moment business revives, the bonds will be at once\r\nconverted, and the currency will meet the demand, and thus the constant\r\nconversion of the one into the other will regulate and maintain the\r\nequilibrium that all previous systems of money have so signally failed\r\nto do.\r\n\r\nIn our next the advantages of such a system will be still further\r\nconsidered and expounded, so that every one may be able to comprehend\r\nthat a money system is possible of invention, upon which foreign bankers\r\ncan not play their long-practiced games to any further one-sided\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\n NEW YORK, Oct. 11, 1870.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    PAPERS ON FINANCE AND COMMERCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 NO. X.\r\n\r\nThe advantages of a currency which, instead of possessing the capacity\r\nof redeemability, is at all times convertible into something that is\r\nitself productive, cannot fail to be appreciated by all who have given\r\nany attention to the science of money. Theories regarding this branch of\r\nsocial science have been about as destructive to the proper development\r\nand understanding of the science as religious theories have been to that\r\nof a proper appreciation of the functions and the benefits of religion.\r\nThe last have at all times stood in the path of progress. So, too, have\r\nthe first. And for this reason are we to-day almost at the mercy of\r\nthose who are possessed of the accumulated wealth of the world, which in\r\ncombination would be a power sufficient to control all government in its\r\ninterests, and thus it would be enabled to bring the world again under a\r\ndespotism to which that of past despotism would hold no comparison.\r\n\r\nIn such a money system too much circulating medium could never be\r\nuttered, for the moment a surplus quantity over the demands of\r\nlegitimate business was in circulation, that moment it would begin to be\r\nconverted into the four per cent. bonds; so that if there were two\r\nthousand millions uttered, it would always be worth just four per cent.;\r\nand if there were but five hundred millions uttered, it would never be\r\nworth any more than four per cent. Thus it is plainly to be seen that\r\nthe government would always be necessitated to provide just as near the\r\namount of circulating medium demanded as it would be possible to arrive\r\nat, _and no more_; for on any such surplus it would, as a matter of\r\ncourse, be obliged to pay the interest provided, which thus becomes the\r\nabsolute measure of value that money requires to make it substantial,\r\nand which is required to deprive it of that capacity for producing great\r\ncommercial inflations, which, in the financial history of this country,\r\ndevelop and burst about every second decade, and which produce not only\r\nthe complete destruction of all purely speculative enterprises, but also\r\nthe most wide-spread and fearful demoralization in all legitimate\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nUnder such a money system, speculation, with all its accompanying\r\ndemoralization, would rapidly depart from all classes of society. It is\r\na notorious, yet unappreciated fact, that speculative enterprises lie at\r\nthe foundation of all financial disorder, for which, if a remedy can be\r\nprovided, the very considerable talent and time which is now devoted to\r\nit would be turned into channels of general usefulness and\r\nproductiveness. Production is the foundation of all wealth, and,\r\nconsequently, to increase wealth, production must be increased.\r\nSpeculation is that spirit which constantly saps the vitality of wealth,\r\nand, therefore, society has no greater nor more debasing enemy than\r\nspeculation.\r\n\r\nIt may be objected to by some that speculation leads to national\r\ndevelopment; that in many of the wild railroad, emigration, city and\r\nother schemes, that have been projected and carried through under its\r\nstimulus, the welfare of the country has been subserved. To this\r\ningenious objection it may be answered that, under a sound financial\r\nsystem, these enterprises would have been undertaken everywhere when the\r\ndemands of the country warranted them, and because there was a demand\r\nfor them, instead of for the pure purposes of individual or corporate\r\nspeculation. One of the best results that would flow from this change of\r\nincentive would be, that no “Bubbles” could be palmed off on the unwary\r\nby “flash” advertising, which would burst at some future time, to the\r\ndestruction of some deluded victims of unscrupulous financiers.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the most fatal of commercial errors to suppose that large\r\ngeneral prices are an evidence of prosperity. On the contrary, it is\r\ntrue that when the prices affixed to any kind of property are larger\r\nthan its real capacity for production, it is an expansion which must at\r\nsome time collapse, to the detriment of the holder. Thus, whenever\r\nproperty is valued at such a price that it cannot be used to pay a\r\ncertain per cent. income, its value is expanded, and though this\r\nexpansion may continue under the pressure of a so-called prosperity, and\r\nbecome general, even country-wide, if the general productive capacity of\r\nthe country cannot sustain this increased value, collapse must as surely\r\ncome as results follow causes. Even in this demonstration it is\r\nconclusively shown that the productive capacity of the country is the\r\n_real_ measure of value, and that, _finally_, no matter how irrelevant\r\nthe process of wealth and prices may have been to it, _it is the power\r\nwhich ultimately measures all values_.\r\n\r\nThis appears to us such a plain proposition that it seems almost\r\nsuperfluous to present further arguments to prove the desirability of at\r\nonce proceeding to make the productive capacity of the country the basis\r\nof value upon which to issue a currency to meet the legitimate demands\r\nof the people for the purposes of exchange. The attention of all who\r\nrealize the unstableness of our present system, and the desirableness of\r\nproviding against the tremendous fluctuations it is capable of, is\r\ncalled to the necessity of uniting to bring this matter prominently\r\nbefore the NEXT CONGRESS, with the view of having it thus brought\r\nprominently before the _country_, and of having it thoroughly analyzed\r\nand understood. When analyzed and comprehended, the idea of a _gold\r\nbasis_ will forever depart from all progressive minds, and the impetus\r\nthe new money system will thereby receive will never be checked until\r\nits science is developed into general national practice.\r\n\r\n NEW YORK, Oct. 27, 1870.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    PAPERS ON FINANCE AND COMMERCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                NO. XI.\r\n\r\nIn our last, the necessity of urging the consideration of the finance\r\nquestion upon Congress, with the view of having the whole range of the\r\nmatter brought prominently before the country, was proposed. Of all\r\npractical questions that require immediate solution, none is of so much\r\nimportance to man as this; and none more so to woman unless that of\r\nequality for herself is. No country can enjoy a series of years of\r\nuninterrupted commercial prosperity when that country has a circulating\r\nmedium which can be affected by the manipulations of shrewd financiers\r\nfor their own ends. And no financial policy is more ruinous to the true\r\ninterests of a whole country than that of a constantly changing\r\ncommercial valuation upon either personal or real estate, excepting\r\nalone in the latter, when it becomes the location of more capacity for\r\nactual production.\r\n\r\nReal estate, abstractly considered, has no appreciable value. It only\r\nbecomes relatively valuable when labor can make use of it to produce\r\nsomething valuable from it or by it. Absolutely there can be no\r\nindividual title to any part of the soil of any country. Taken as a\r\nwhole, the land comprised within the limits of the authority of any\r\ngovernment can be made such use of as such government may determine, but\r\nas to actual conveyance of absolute individual ownership, that is\r\nimpossible, because none of the powers involved in the attempt at\r\nconveyance could have had any part in the production of said land, and,\r\ntherefore, could have no right or authority to transfer it, from the\r\nfact of an entire lack of title to transfer.\r\n\r\nIt may be objected that these are merely technical assumptions which the\r\ncustoms of society have never admitted. So, too, may it be objected to\r\nall encroachments of scientific principles upon old forms and customs.\r\nNevertheless, science continues to analyze and demonstrate, and the\r\nworld continues to come more and more under its guidance every year. In\r\nthe principles of government science has not, until very recently, found\r\ngrounds of attack. Since it has come to be recognized that there really\r\nis a science of society, and consequently that all its structure can be\r\nanalyzed, understood and guided by its deductions many of the customs\r\nand practices that have so long controlled the people are found to be\r\nentirely without the support of principles fundamentally necessary to\r\nassure a permanently constructive form of society.\r\n\r\nWherever maxims of temporary policy are the guiding rules, there will\r\never be alternate construction and destruction; but wherever scientific,\r\ndemonstrable principles are the governing power, there will be found\r\npermanency. That “money” is susceptible of analysis, and of being\r\npredicated upon a scientific basis is no longer to be questioned. It is\r\na branch of the science of society, and as such must receive\r\nconsideration as the science itself becomes disseminated among the\r\npeoples. It was not many years ago that “the sciences” were unknown in\r\nour common schools. It will not be many years hence until the science of\r\nsociety will be a recognized branch of every child’s education in the\r\nmost enlightened portions of the world. Political economy, which is a\r\nbranch of social science, is regarded with favor by many now, and,\r\ncomprehensively speaking, all these questions which have been looked\r\nupon as “too abstract” for common comprehension, are found to be the\r\nreal principles which underlie all social strictures.\r\n\r\nFirst in importance, because it leads to the recognition of the\r\n“ultimate condition,” is the question of intercourse between the peoples\r\nof the earth. Money, as the means of bringing about this intercourse,\r\nshould receive primary consideration. Let the fact once be generally\r\nrecognized that the world is at last tending to “a unity of the\r\npeoples,” and financial and commercial unity are the introductory\r\nunities upon which to hasten governmental unity. Were these fully\r\nestablished upon a basis of mutual interest instead of upon the policy\r\nof each obtaining all the personal and selfish advantages possible,\r\nthere could no such strifes as the one convulsing Europe to-day ever\r\noccur. Thus it appears that the assimilation of the world under one\r\ncommon interest is in the first instance a question of a unity of\r\nmaterial interests which must serve as the foundation for all others to\r\nbuild upon.\r\n\r\nFinance and commerce, then, lie at the very threshold of all the\r\nprogress that is to be made in the direction of governmental\r\nconsolidation, and when so recognized they will be rescued from the\r\nposition that they now occupy as the means only of pursuing selfish\r\ninterests, and be raised into that of principles and rules of action by\r\nwhich all intercourse must be regulated. Commerce, in its most\r\ncomprehensive sense, does not apply merely to the exchange of the\r\nmaterial products of the world, but to the exchange of intellectual,\r\nmoral, social and religious products also, and its application thereby\r\nbecomes common to all the interests of humanity. And as finance grows\r\nout of the necessities of commerce, it also becomes equally with\r\ncommerce a humanitarian question. It is in this broad and general sense\r\nthat all questions regarding it should hereafter be considered and not\r\nupon the basis of how much advantage such a measure will give an\r\nindividual or a nation over another individual or nation.\r\n\r\nLike all other questions that are now coming prominently before the\r\nworld for solution, this one of finance and commerce rises to the\r\ndignity of a question of humanity. They are all to be considered in\r\nregard to their application, not merely to nations, but to all\r\nnations—all peoples—as forming the basis of the future confederation of\r\nthe world under one government to be known as the United States of the\r\nWorld, when all the people will be inspired with a common Religious\r\nsentiment in regard to their primary origin and their ultimate destiny;\r\nwhen all the peoples will be governed in their relation to each other by\r\nthe common social sentiment arising from the recognition of the fact\r\nthat they are necessarily a community of brothers from having a common\r\norigin and destiny; when all the peoples will give a common adhesion to\r\nand support the deductions of a Universal Science, let those deductions\r\nmilitate as they will and must against whatever of speculation and\r\ntheory there may still hang like a pall of night over the intellect of\r\nman. To all of these ultimate conditions of mankind, finance and\r\ncommerce must furnish the means of attainment; and being thus the first\r\nessentials to the beginning of the actual constructive process which,\r\nwhen completed, will be this grand consummation, they should be treated\r\nwith that gravity and consideration which is due to so grand a position\r\nas they are assigned in the third order of general civilization. Policy\r\nshould be entirely discarded from all place in the argument, and\r\nprinciples should alone be discussed. When the consideration is fairly\r\nbegun upon this basis, scientific ideas regarding money will be rapidly\r\ndiffused among the people, who now do not even dream that money can be\r\nreduced to the rules of scientific demonstration.\r\n\r\nWe urge again that this question should receive its proper share of\r\nattention at the hands of our next Congress as being the questions upon\r\nwhich the future good of mankind depends more immediately than any other\r\nthat will be likely to command the undivided attention of it. This once\r\nsettled upon the true principles, all other questions which all future\r\nCongresses will have to consider will be virtually determined by it.\r\n\r\n NEW YORK, Nov. 4, 1870.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    PAPERS ON FINANCE AND COMMERCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                NO. XII.\r\n\r\nIn the treatment of these subjects in the general sense in which they\r\nbecome important to all the people the range is very much extended\r\nbeyond that commonly compassed by those whose interest compels them to\r\ntemporary considerations for the promoting of immediate interests under\r\nthe systems in vogue. All such kind of treatment deals with effects, and\r\nwould never remedy an existing want, nor correct illegitimate practices.\r\nIf there are wants in existing systems, and if there are illegitimate\r\npractices which are possible under them, there is but one way to supply\r\nthe one or to correct the other, and that is to go to the root of the\r\nmatter where the causes exist which make these possible.\r\n\r\nIn this series of articles it has been the endeavor to point out some of\r\nthe most prominent evidences that our financial system was unsound, and\r\nalso to show, by as strict an analysis as was possible in the space\r\nallotted, what the true basis for a sound financial system was, and\r\nwhere it was to be found, and, having done this, such methods of\r\nadministration were hinted at as would reduce the system, when put into\r\noperation, to a permanent and fixed measure of all values, which it was\r\nargued was equally as necessary when value is to be measured as the same\r\nfixedness is when any other quantity is to be measured.\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested by some that, in presenting our statements in the\r\nterse, undiluted manner we have, that those who have not been habitual\r\nthinkers upon this subject might fail to catch the full application of\r\nthe propositions, and by so failing consider the system impracticable.\r\nTo obviate such objections we shall, by further treatment of obscure\r\npoints, attempt to make them plain to all who can understand the English\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\nFirst, a brief re-statement and condensation of the entire outline:\r\nMoney, being an invention to facilitate the exchanges of the products of\r\nlabor, it should be formulated with direct reference to the conditions\r\nwhich made the invention necessary, out of which it should naturally\r\ngrow; and also with direct regard as to how the invention should best\r\nmeet the required case—that is, the invention should be adapted to the\r\nconditions, instead of making an invention without regard to the\r\nconditions, and then attempting to force the conditions to comply with\r\nthe capacity of the invention.\r\n\r\nThis is a point which should be thoroughly comprehended, for in it lies\r\nthe whole fault of making gold a measure of value, and we therefore\r\nshall attempt to offer a common illustration directly in point.\r\n\r\nLet it be supposed that there is a stream which, to accommodate travel,\r\nrequires to be bridged, and that the bridge has to be constructed and\r\nmoved to the stream. The first procedure would be to determine just how\r\nlong the bridge must be to span the stream. It would then be constructed\r\nand moved to the stream, which it of course would span. But suppose\r\npersons knowing there was a stream to be crossed, but not knowing its\r\nbreadth, had gone to work and constructed the bridge and then had\r\nattempted to compel it, when too short, to extend across the stream.\r\nThis would have been a case of attempting to compel the conditions for\r\nwhich the invention was made to accommodate themselves to the invention.\r\nAnd this has been just what the world has been all this time doing in\r\nattempting to compel the conditions for which money was invented to\r\naccommodate themselves to the possibilities of gold, which was invented\r\nas money without any reference being had to the functions it was to\r\nperform, or to the conditions it was required to meet.\r\n\r\nIt would be just as reasonable and just as sensible to attempt to compel\r\na house to perform the functions of a bridge as it is to attempt to\r\ncompel gold to perform the functions of money, for gold is not nor\r\ncannot ever be made to meet the requirements for which money is\r\ndemanded; whereas, money should be of such character as to fully meet\r\nthe requirements for which it is used, but should not be possessed of\r\n_any qualities that would render it useful for any other purpose\r\nwhatever_, so that there could be no possibility of its ever being used\r\nfor any other purposes, which impossibility would forever make\r\nspeculation impossible.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that we have made clear the purposes for which money is\r\nrequired and also clear that it is utterly futile to attempt to compel\r\nany invention to meet those requirements where it is not formulated for\r\nthe express purpose. We have heretofore shown that gold is a purely\r\narbitrary standard which has no scientific relations whatever to the\r\nproduct of labor which it is required to measure, but that it is itself\r\na product, and as such requires to be measured. A gallon of molasses\r\nwould never be thought of as a measure of distance, but it would be just\r\nas reasonable to expect it to measure it as it is to expect a certain\r\nquantity of gold to measure the value of a horse. A horse may be\r\nexchanged for a certain amount of gold. So, too, may a horse be\r\nexchanged for a certain amount of wheat, but that process does not make\r\neither the horse or the wheat money. Money is that which can equally\r\nrepresent the wheat, the horse and the gold; and anything that cannot do\r\nthis is not money.\r\n\r\nHence it is seen that every step we take in examining the true bearings\r\nof the money question brings us nearer and clearer to the proposition\r\nalready made—that the capacity for production is the true basis of\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\n NEW YORK, Nov. 11, 1870\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    PAPERS ON FINANCE AND COMMERCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               NO. XIII.\r\n\r\nWe are perfectly aware of the very many objections which arise in the\r\nminds of the people to such a currency as has been proposed, but the\r\nthoughtless one of “What! an irredeemable paper money! Oh, no! that will\r\nnever do; that means utter repudiation,” which is the most commonly\r\nmade, scarcely merits attention. Will those, who so earnestly place\r\nthemselves in opposition to a convertible currency, stop and consider\r\nfor just one moment. What is the ten-dollar gold piece you have just\r\nreceived for a ten-dollar note good for? Will it feed or clothe you? or\r\nwill it _directly_ minister to any of your needs or to those of any of\r\nyour family? Directly, it will do none of these things for you; _but you\r\ncan have it really redeemed by something that will_ feed, clothe and\r\nminister to all your requirements. You will thus perceive that you have\r\nbeen and still are laboring under a foolish delusion regarding this\r\nprecious metal, for you have all the time been getting your paper money\r\nredeemed by your gold money, which you finally are obliged to redeem by\r\nthat which is really valuable—that which it takes to maintain life and\r\nmake it desirable.\r\n\r\nNow, you know very well that the gold there is in the world cannot\r\nredeem or represent the values of the world. Were it a thousand times as\r\nvaluable as it really is—that is to say, could the consent of the world\r\nbe obtained to making the amount of gold which now represents one dollar\r\nto represent a thousand dollars—there would be a possibility of the gold\r\nin existence representing the value of the world; but as no such result\r\nas this is anticipated, it is in vain for you to cling to any such\r\nmythological and speculative theory.\r\n\r\nAgain: What terrible outrage would your conscience sustain if you would\r\ngive a little calmer consideration to a proposition which you have\r\nalways heretofore rejected without thought. With your gold you have been\r\nable to obtain that which you required to sustain and make life\r\nagreeable. These necessities, then, are the really valuable things of\r\nthe world. What objection, then, can you make that can have the\r\nsanction, even of your own reason, to at once admitting that these are\r\nthe only real values the world contains, and consequently—because\r\nlegitimately—that whatever is money must be a representative of these\r\nvaluables: and also and further, that anything bearing the name of\r\nmoney, which does not justly and fully represent the sum total of these,\r\nis not money in the true sense of that term.\r\n\r\nAgain: Money may be considered the negative pole of the battery of\r\nvalue. To all things there are two extremes and a mean, the evidence of\r\nperfection being that there is always an equilibrium sustained between\r\nthe extremes through the medium of the mean. Products are positive\r\nexistences which go forth to administer to the demands of human nature,\r\nand expend themselves in the negative returning force, money; which, in\r\nbeing brought back to the point which it represents, becomes a positive\r\npower itself, having the capacity to obtain labor which restores what\r\nhas been expended, and thus the circuit is complete and nothing is lost;\r\nthe same products exist and the same representation of them also exists.\r\nIf, perchance the return of the products is not always immediately made,\r\nthe power to return them is never lost, though that may be in a thousand\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nThus it will be seen by all, if they will but give the necessary\r\nattention, that the proposed currency which shall be representative of\r\nthe products of labor is not only the only natural money there can be,\r\nbut that it can never appreciate nor depreciate, because every twelve\r\nmonths it is worth just one twenty-fifth part of itself—for it is\r\nbelieved that this per cent. of increase is the true balance between\r\naccumulation and production; if, on trial, this balance should be found\r\ntoo small, or too much in favor of production, it would be increased;\r\nand if found too large, or too much in favor of accumulation it could be\r\nreduced. This must be a subject of test, and when tested, legislation\r\ncan increase or decrease the standard of value by making the “measure”\r\nlarger or smaller, just the same as it does other “measures.”\r\n\r\nWe believe that the inauguration of such a money system would be the\r\nbeginning of the “leveling down and the leveling up” of the capitalist\r\nand the laborer, and that such a thing as practical equality will be\r\nimpossible under any less radical and comprehensive change from present\r\nsystems. It is to be hoped that that large proportion of the whole\r\npeople which is represented by the classes that desire to be “levelled\r\nup,” will give this most serious matter their most serious attention. We\r\nare aware that it is a subject but little understood, and that the\r\nprejudice of the people is in favor of the money god, gold. But, as in\r\nreligion, so will it be in money; when reason and common sense are\r\nadmitted to the debate, mythologic spectres and theoretic fancies will\r\nbegin to assume their true shapes, and the realities to arise from the\r\ndepths in which they have been confined.\r\n\r\n NEW YORK, Nov. 25, 1870.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        BASIS OF PHYSICAL LIFE.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  THE UNITY OF LIFE, POWER AND MOTION.\r\n\r\nI beg to present the following as the foundation for a series of\r\narticles which it is proposed to present in due time. At first glance it\r\nmay be deemed too abstract for the purpose in view, but it must be\r\nremembered that all action is primarily derived from a common basis of\r\nlife, and that it is from this basis all action _must_ spring, because\r\ngeneral principles only are deducible from it:\r\n\r\n“In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word\r\nwas God.” Although human conception cannot trace existence back to the\r\ntime when “the Word was God,” the proposition is one which consciousness\r\ncan accept without analysis, and define and understand as the Absolute\r\nin its broadest sense; but, when invested with the infinitude of\r\nphenomena and facts, the mind loses itself and gives way beneath the\r\nuniversal evidence that life, power and motion form a unit. Accepting,\r\nthen, this proposition, without attempting to solve it, a basis is found\r\nfrom which to reason, and which we could not have discovered by\r\nreasoning backward from effects. God was in the beginning: the beginning\r\nwas God. Acknowledging this, the mind cannot conceive of aught else\r\nexisting in the beginning. He was the Supreme Whole, the great Central\r\nHeart, from and by which all things were to come. This truth should be\r\nfully accepted, for from it can be shown that the facts of the present\r\nare the legitimate outgrowth of this complete Oneness.\r\n\r\nAll nations have had a god or gods, though no two of them have been\r\nidentical. Nor has the conception of a god remained unchanged with any\r\npeople for any great length of time. Were each person to define his idea\r\nof a god, there would be nearly as many different ideals as there are\r\nindividuals in the nation, thus showing that all knowledge is relative\r\nor symbolic. As there can be but one god conceived of under our\r\nproposition, the question arises how so many can be held up before the\r\nChristian world, and each claimed to be “the only true god.” In the\r\nsolution of this will be found the chief burden which ignorance and\r\nsuperstition use to load the mind with their absurdities. Freed from\r\nthis burden, the mind would form a true conception of the unity in\r\ndiversity of nature, and recognize God as infinite and eternal. It will\r\nbe readily admitted that God is indestructible. So, too, is matter. Then\r\nwe have from the beginning two indestructibles—or, at least, for the\r\npresent, it must be assumed they are two—God and Nature, Spirit and\r\nMatter, or Power and Resistance. These embrace “the Whole,” from which\r\nnothing could have been taken away or added thereto. As God, therefore,\r\nwas All in All at the beginning, so he must ever remain the same; and\r\nthis is true also of Nature.\r\n\r\nReasoning thus from this basis it must be found that every power has its\r\norigin in the first power—God, the mainspring of all action. Life, then,\r\nmay be said to be motion making itself manifest under the influence of\r\npower—to what? It may be difficult for the mind to accept so broad an\r\napplication of this all-pervading power, but it confesses it without\r\ncomprehending it whenever it declares that God is omnipotent and\r\nomnipresent. The world little thinks of the extent of such an assertion,\r\nfor it breaks down all the Christian ideas of that antagonism known as\r\nthe Powers of the Devil; it banishes the possibility of creation proving\r\na partial failure and enables the soul to recognize an ever-present,\r\nall-pervading, though inscrutable God.\r\n\r\nIt may then be asked, Is God omnipotent? If believers in an incarnation\r\nof Evil answer yes, what becomes of the foundation for such a belief? If\r\nno, what becomes of their God? If He be omnipotent, He must be not only\r\nthe source of all power, but All Power. To assert otherwise is to\r\ndeclare that there are two infinites—an assertion which contains its own\r\nrefutation. While the mind can conceive that God is All in All, it\r\ncannot at the same time conceive that He is not All in All, or that the\r\nDevil is a part of the All in All, in opposition and contradistinction\r\nto God. Those, therefore, who believe that God is All in All, and also\r\nbelieve in a Devil, believe an impossibility, for two persons or things\r\ncannot be the same, or occupy the same place at the same time. The\r\nabsurdity, then, of the divisibility of the Supreme Power becomes at\r\nonce apparent. The argument is of importance as it furnishes a\r\nwell-defined basis, which meets every difficulty and arrays it in\r\nsupport of the unity of all things and the supremacy of God.\r\n\r\nThe question, what and where is God? has been often asked; but the\r\nvarious attempts to answer the unanswerable, have only given the\r\nunreflecting mind another’s idea instead of a just and comprehensive\r\nconception of God’s complete existence. In reasoning on so important an\r\ninquiry, the mind should soar above principles and ideas, and in one\r\nvast grasp say that God is the whole. Where is God? He is everywhere. In\r\nthis answer we have no clearer solution of the query than we have when\r\nwe say God is incomprehensible to the human mind; still the form is such\r\nas the mind can use in measuring its relative parts.\r\n\r\nFrom the Great First Cause, and from it alone, has come the present in\r\nall its beauty and variety, material and spiritual. Though the effects\r\nmay continue to increase in number throughout an infinite future, the\r\nsum of them can never amount to the First Cause. God must and will\r\nforever remain superior to all the effects of the workings of this\r\npower.\r\n\r\nThe material universe, science tells us, is composed of some sixty-four\r\nor more elementary parts. An element cannot be resolved into two or more\r\ndifferent substances. These elements combine under certain conditions\r\nand in certain proportions with each other to form compounds differing\r\nmaterially from their component parts. Everything we see in nature is\r\nformed of these elementary materials; yet, extensive as these compounds\r\nare, they are fashioned according to universal and unchangeable laws.\r\nWhile the existence of any of the elements uncombined is rare, their\r\ncombinations fill all space, and are co-extensive with the Divine\r\nSpirit. Spirit and Matter—God and Nature, seem, therefore, to be forever\r\nunited.\r\n\r\nBut how have all these things come? What is this inexhaustible power\r\neverywhere manifested, and what the laws governing its application? Go\r\nback to the time when no compound bodies existed on this planet, and\r\nwhat was there? God was there in all his absoluteness, all his infinity.\r\nAll the elements of matter were there in the same proportions and\r\nquantities as now exist, but uncombined. In an abstract sense, an\r\nelement is a unit mass, without life, power or motion. What constitutes\r\nit an existence, gives it life, power and motion, and the capacity of\r\ncombining with other diverse existences? We cannot conceive of matter,\r\neven in its simplest form, as devoid of all active life principles, for\r\nthat would be to conceive a place, occupied by matter, where God is not.\r\nEach element, therefore, contains its portion of the Eternal Spirit,\r\nwithout which it would not even be a substance, but with which it can\r\nunite with other similarly endowed simples. It seems impossible not to\r\nconclude, then, that the life, power and motion found in all material\r\nsubstances, is that life and power we call Infinite.\r\n\r\nTo further illustrate this indwelling life principle, we quote from a\r\ncelebrated author, who, speaking of the “winds and currents of the sea,”\r\nsays: “Men try to explain everything by the wind and the current. Now\r\nthere is in the air a force which is not wind, and in the water a force\r\nthat is not current. This force, the same in the air as in the water, is\r\neffluvium. The air and the water are two masses of liquid nearly\r\nidentical and changing mutually into each other. * * * The effluvium is\r\nalone fluid; the wind and the current are only impulses. The effluvium\r\nis a steady stream * * * and is invisible. Yet from time to time it\r\nsays, ‘There I am;’ and its way of saying so is a thunder clap. The sea\r\nis as much magnetic as watery. An ocean of forces floats unknown in the\r\nocean of currents. To see in the ocean only a mass of water is not to\r\nsee it at all.” To which we would add, that to see in the manifestations\r\nof nature, nature only, is not to see it at all, for the power producing\r\nit is not recognized. What is seen is not the reality, but that through\r\nwhich the reality makes itself known.\r\n\r\nWhat has thus far been considered may be consolidated into this\r\ncomprehensive proposition: That there is a power existing everywhere, of\r\nwhich we can know nothing absolutely except that consciousness tells us\r\nit is. At the same time we are conscious of our incapability to define\r\nor comprehend it, and that all we can ever know of this power is its\r\nphysical manifestations. Hence the knowledge of what we see, hear, feel,\r\ntaste and smell is abstractly symbolic and relative, the only absolute\r\nknowledge we can possibly have—if knowledge it be—is a consciousness of\r\nour infinite existence. In this view of the existence of God, which is\r\nthe basis of all religious ideas, religion may be said to be superior to\r\nscience, because it remains immovable in consciousness. Religion belongs\r\nto the unknowable; science deals with the knowable, which is the\r\nmanifestation of the unknowable. Therefore, viewed philosophically,\r\nreligion and science stand for the subjective and objective whose\r\nrelations comprise the whole. The presence, then, in consciousness, of\r\nwhat we can by no means account for, must be the actual presence of that\r\nof which consciousness is made up—the elementary spiritual principles\r\nrepresentative in us as individual existences of the great Infinite\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nAmbiguity in the use of terms leads to confusion of ideas and thought,\r\nand is one great general cause of the ignorance and superstition still\r\nexisting among apparently enlightened nations. Many terms, supposed to\r\nconvey certain well-defined ideas, are found to be deficient when\r\nanalyzed, and others stand for nothing in substance. Many are in common\r\nuse whose meaning the man of religion, science or philosophy would be\r\nembarrassed to explain. Chief among these are: The Infinite, The\r\nAbsolute, Causation and Effect, Power, Motion, Matter, Space, Time,\r\nResistance, Eternity, Immortality, Good, Evil, Heat, Light, Rewards,\r\nPunishment, Justice, Law, Order. As the argument proceeds it will be\r\nseen how nearly the whole of these and many similar terms are resolvable\r\ninto the few which convey realities.\r\n\r\nAll things that can be resolved into parts cannot be said to be\r\nexistences. Existence carries with it the idea of permanent continuity,\r\nsomething self-dependent, superior to everything else as an entity. What\r\none term will express absolute superiority? The universe of space is\r\noccupied by matter which, acted upon by an incomprehensible Power,\r\nproduces manifestations or motions. These being successive, time becomes\r\na necessary constituent. Do we need any other term to cover all the\r\nmanifestations? Is there any part of the universe left untouched by the\r\nfew terms? But allowing that they include the Whole, some one must be of\r\nprimary consequence, while the others are auxiliary thereto.\r\n\r\nThe term Motion will be found, on analysis, to be the result of Power\r\nacting upon Matter, and the proposition is comprehensive enough to\r\ninclude every known movement. Hence every manifestation in the material\r\nworld can readily be accounted for by the combination of these two\r\nterms. Though not so immediately apparent, it will be shown that mental\r\nmanifestations are also included in this. If all manifestations are then\r\nexplainable by these two terms, all minor terms must be but names for\r\nthe different forms under which these two manifest themselves, and into\r\nwhich they must ultimately be resolved. Motion, it was found, was\r\nresolvable into Power and Matter. Can these be resolved into anything\r\nmore general than themselves?\r\n\r\nThe universe is composed objectively of matter. Is it made up of\r\nanything else? An absolute vacuum is an impossibility in thought. Then\r\nwhat we term space is filled with something, and only matter is\r\ncomprehensive enough to include all. But matter alone would convey the\r\nidea of space filled with something at perfect rest. The term motion\r\nthen becomes necessary. This involves a subject, the cause of the\r\nmotion; and an object, the thing moved—power the cause, motion the\r\nobject. Can these be resolved into anything more general? As stated, the\r\nuniverse is composed of matter, manifesting itself by and through\r\nmotion; and motion, as was seen, can be caused only by the application\r\nof power to matter, and no other term is sufficiently general to\r\ncomprehend the causes of motion. By the union or duality of power and\r\nmatter everything is brought within the sphere of consciousness, if not\r\nof comprehension. But which of all the manifestations of power acting\r\nupon matter is of primary importance? Of which does consciousness\r\nearliest take cognizance?\r\n\r\nThe universe of matter is boundless. Space conveys the idea of something\r\nbeyond which there is nothing. Else it would be limited by that which is\r\nbeyond, and we can conceive of nothing as existing without extension,\r\nand extension implies the occupancy of a certain defined limit, which\r\nlimit must be within space. Space being undefinable, that which occupies\r\nit must partake of the same characteristic when considered as a whole.\r\nThe same line of reasoning applies to power and time. Succession of\r\nevents compels an occupation of a part of infinite duration as matter,\r\nrelatively considered, occupies space; that is, between two or more\r\nseparate facts there must be a lapse of time before consciousness can\r\narrange them so as as to take cognizance thereof. Whether this is of\r\nitself an actual existence, or some method of an actual existence, it is\r\na necessity to consciousness. Hence, time is related to power as space\r\nis to matter. Power and matter being the subjective realities, while\r\nspace and time are their objective results, or the necessary effects of\r\nthe experience in consciousness of their united result, which is motion.\r\nOur ideas of space and time are derived from experiences of power acting\r\nupon matter, while motion, the effect thereof, unites the two in\r\nconsciousness as relative realities which must be a part of absolute\r\nrealities.\r\n\r\nIt is clear, then, that all we can know of the unknowable arises from\r\nour experience of power and matter, and that within the sphere of their\r\nmanifestations all effects are included. But while each is necessary to\r\nproduce effect, we must not forget that we would have no consciousness\r\nof the existence of matter were it not the object of the application of\r\npower; hence we must conclude that power is of primordial importance,\r\nand, as such, the most general and comprehensive of scientific terms.\r\nAll knowledge and consciousness grow out of experiences of power, which\r\nmust be considered the general ultimate. All theories regarding it are\r\nbut theories. Power is untouched by them, while matter, space, time and\r\nmotion may be considered either as its constituents or as modes of its\r\nmanifestations.\r\n\r\nTo make the argument more complete to those unaccustomed to resolve\r\nphenomenon into its ultimate cause, some illustrations of such\r\nresolutions will prepare the mind to accept the conclusions arrived at:\r\nLet it be supposed that some circumstance calls for the manufacture of\r\ncotton cloth unlike, in some respect, any ever manufactured—say in\r\nwidth—how must it be produced? Reasoning inductively and given the raw\r\nmaterial, the last necessity apparently is a loom that will admit of the\r\nwidth required and the prepared webbing and filling. Still, the cloth\r\ncannot be produced without the further aid of motion in the loom, which\r\nmotion must be generated by power through certain machinery, obtained\r\nfrom setting free such portion of power as had been concentrated in\r\ncoal. This expands water into steam; steam in escaping compels the\r\npiston of the engine to move, and this motion is communicated to the\r\nloom, the required cloth being the effect. It will be seen that whatever\r\nintermediate processes were necessary they were all resolvable into the\r\npower concentrated in the coal. What was then of first importance in the\r\nproduction of cloth? It was neither the loom nor the cotton nor the\r\nmachinery, but the power giving motion to all. This illustration may be\r\nused symbolically to explain everything incomprehensible in the\r\nuniverse, that is, all manifestations of power working in and through\r\nmatter, producing motion and its effects.\r\n\r\nAll material effects being explained by power acting on matter, may not\r\nthis simple formula equally symbolize all mental operations the product\r\nof which is thought? The question primarily arising would be, what is\r\nthought and how is it produced? Let us analyze it. Something cannot be\r\nproduced from nothing. Thought is something. Thought is then the product\r\nof something previously existing. Immateriality cannot be conceived of.\r\nTherefore thought is not only material in itself, but the product of\r\nmatter in motion; and as motion is only possible through power applied\r\nto matter, thought must be a result of such an operation. Can it be\r\nexplained and comprehended upon this theory? Let it be supposed that\r\nsome great noise should suddenly occur just outside a house in which\r\nwere 5,000 people. Each one would ask the mental question, or “think,”\r\nWhat was that caused by? Now, that thought would be the product of the\r\nsound heard. But how heard? Simply thus: Rapid vibrations of the air,\r\ncaused by some unknown matter in motion, came in contact with the organs\r\nof hearing, were transmitted to the nerves, and finally taken up into\r\nconsciousness. The whole operation is a purely physical one, and there\r\nis a perfect equivalent between the amount of vibration and the\r\nresulting sensation; in other words, the effect corresponds to the\r\ncause. It may also be remarked that a hundred physical bodies of\r\ndifferent weights produce as many different sensations; the difference\r\nbeing always in exact proportion to the difference in their respective\r\nweights. Similar differences follow when matter at various degrees of\r\ntemperature comes in contact with the body. The same is true regarding\r\nlight upon the optic nerve.\r\n\r\nLet us next see if that variety of thought or sensation which arises\r\nspontaneously within the individual is due to any different agency.\r\nPerhaps the most comprehensive and conclusive evidence of the material\r\norigin of thought is, that a child born under even favorable\r\ncircumstances, but kept from all external, material and mental\r\nmanifestations, grows up a simple idiot. Without, then, the\r\nmanifestation of power acting upon matter, no original individual\r\nthought or conception is possible with the supposed exception of\r\nspontaneous thought hereafter to be treated. Further evidence of this is\r\nseen when an adult is kept in solitary confinement, or cast away upon an\r\nuninhabited island; memory fails, language is lost, and the person\r\nbecomes a semi-idiot. The following extract, from an address by Dr. J.\r\nW. Draper, is made to show that scientific men are admitting the fact\r\nthat the mind is the result of the processes here indicated—a collection\r\nof facts gained by impressions constantly repeated. He says: “There are\r\nsuccessive phases * * * in the early action of the mind. As soon as the\r\nsenses are in working order * * * a process of collecting facts is\r\ncommenced. These are at first of the most homely kind, but the sphere\r\nfrom which they are gathered is extended by degrees. We may, therefore,\r\nconsider that this collecting of facts is the earliest indication of the\r\naction of the brain, and it is an operation which, with more or less\r\nactivity, continues through life. * * * Soon a second characteristic\r\nappears. The learning of the relationship of the facts thus acquired to\r\none another. * * * This stage has been sometimes spoken of as the dawn\r\nof the reasoning faculty. A third characteristic of almost\r\ncontemporaneous appearance may be remarked—it is the putting to use\r\nfacts that have been acquired and the relationships that have been\r\ndetermined. * * * Now this triple natural process * * * must be the\r\nbasis of any right system of instruction. It appears, then, that contact\r\nand constant intercourse with external manifestations is not only\r\nnecessary for the production of thought and its collaterals, but that to\r\nretain the consciousness which makes thought possible such\r\nmanifestations must be continuously impressed upon the individual. This\r\nseems to be conclusive that mind is the result of the experiences of the\r\nmanifestations of power.”\r\n\r\nThere is still more subtle evidence that thought, which is only the\r\nmemory of past manifestations of power, or deduction of reason upon\r\nthem, is the product of material action. All mental action depends upon\r\nthe nervous apparatus, and is limited by its capacity. The activity and\r\npower of this apparatus is in a great measure dependent upon the\r\nquantity of phosphorus supplied to it, and this varies at different\r\nperiods of life.\r\n\r\nThe point in question is further sustained by the fact that the rapidity\r\nof thought varies with the supply of blood to the brain. Reduce the\r\naction of the heart to forty beats per minute, and a feeling of languor\r\npermeates the whole system. On the other hand, excess of cerebral\r\ncirculation results in excitement amounting sometimes to actual\r\ndelirium. We must, then, either admit that mental action is a product of\r\nmaterial power, and consequently itself material, or else conclude that,\r\nwhile it is the result of the expenditure of power, it is in its\r\ncharacter immaterial, which would be absurd, because it is impossible to\r\nrepresent immateriality in thought, as consciousness requires a\r\nsubjective action and objective reception of it to complete a thought,\r\nwhile immateriality is neither.\r\n\r\nNot only is mental action affected by the quantity of blood supplied to\r\nthe brain, but also by its quality. This is fully shown in the progress\r\nof certain diseases that prevent its being properly oxygenized, and even\r\nmore conspicuously in the administration of anæsthetics. A similar\r\neffect can be produced upon the brain by deep, full and continuously\r\nrapid breathing, by which an undue amount of oxygen is introduced into\r\nthe circulation.\r\n\r\nIt appears, then, that having a perfect nervous apparatus, certain\r\nspecial materials must be supplied to it from or by which to manufacture\r\nmental and nervous action. Excessive mental action and powerful and\r\ncontinuous emotions produce, as everybody knows, physical prostration.\r\nFrom whatever position, then, we may view any action the physical,\r\nmental or nervous system is capable of producing, we come finally to the\r\nconclusion that they are possible only as the result of the expenditure\r\nof some physical power, and every mind that will justly consider the\r\nevidence must give its adhesion to what science is rapidly making plain.\r\n\r\nBefore closing the consideration of thought another phase of its\r\nmanifestations demands attention. Who has not observed the effect of one\r\nor two minds concentrated upon another person unconscious of the\r\nintention? The object of such concentration becomes conscious of the\r\nfact, and invariably, though involuntarily, looks in the direction\r\nwhence the influence proceeds. Before following this to its legitimate\r\ndeductions it must be taken for granted that there is an individual\r\nexistence after the dissolution of the physical body. Nearly all people\r\naccept this as a part of consciousness. From two propositions already\r\nreceived and well understood, a third may be deduced, and along with it\r\nwill follow such legitimate additional thoughts, ideas, impressions, and\r\nmodifications of former ones, as such deductions necessarily imply. But\r\nhow shall those thoughts not derived from anything already in\r\nconsciousness, be accounted for? And are not all conscious of receiving\r\nmany such thoughts in passive conditions and during sleep? Following up\r\nthe truth that something cannot be produced from nothing, the source of\r\nthese must be found, else our premises are false or incomplete.\r\n\r\nEvery variety of mental action can be communicated. Given a mind\r\npossessed of a new truth and one that has not yet perceived it, the\r\nformer can communicate it to the latter. This communication and\r\nreception have been effected through the medium of speech. Another\r\nmethod is through written or printed language. All this is simply\r\nsymbolic. Sounds and written or printed forms are in themselves nothing\r\nbut motion in the atmosphere and material formations by common consent\r\naccepted to represent other and previous material formations. The one\r\nthing of primary importance is, that the symbols used must be previously\r\nunderstood by both parties to represent identical things at all times.\r\nThought, expressed in an unknown language, is not comprehended; this\r\nindicates that thought abstracted from form is never communicated. It\r\ncannot rise into consciousness even, except through an established form.\r\nCapability of thought is only possible as the result of constant contact\r\nwith external manifestations, systematized under certain regular and\r\nreceived forms which always remain purely symbolic.\r\n\r\nIt remains to be considered how mind affects mind, through the\r\nconcentration of the will, without the apparent use of the above methods\r\nof communication. We have seen that sounds produce an effect upon the\r\nobject through the sense of hearing. But can you analyze hearing, and\r\nshow how the sounds rise into consciousness? When forms are used an\r\neffect is produced through vision. But how does vision rise into\r\nconsciousness? We have seen that an effect is produced by a\r\nconcentration of the mind upon an object, but how this effect rises into\r\nconsciousness is beyond our comprehension.\r\n\r\nWe can now proceed to the application of what has been offered, to the\r\ncommunication between minds by other methods than sound and form. Whence\r\nall these thoughts and impressions that steal into consciousness through\r\nno apparent form? The conclusion seems inevitable that mind can\r\ninfluence mind, whether it be within a physical organization or out of\r\nit. We predicate, therefore, that all thoughts, ideas, impressions, and\r\nsensations not coming from present external manifestations nor from\r\npreviously acquired facts, nor yet from direct communications through\r\nrecognized symbols, are emanations received from some unknown mind\r\neither in or out of the physical form. Nor can we escape from this\r\nconclusion, unless we concede that this case forms an exception to the\r\ngeneral law. All forms, then, of thought, emotion and sensation are the\r\nlegitimate result of the expenditure of power, and may be arrayed in\r\nsupport of the premises that Life, Power, and Motion, wherever found,\r\nare Unitary.\r\n\r\nLet us consider in continuation, what application this unity has as the\r\nbasis of physical life. What constitutes this basis? Is physical life\r\nthe direct effect of the edict of a God reigning over the whole universe\r\nfrom some unknown point within it? No, the theory of a special\r\nProvidence is fast giving place to new and better things—to law and\r\norder. It is beginning to dawn upon mankind that “the only true God”\r\nmust be beyond our comprehension as the universe is, and that it is\r\nfolly or presumptive egotism to assert that God is this or that. A God\r\npossessing such inconsistent infinite powers as are usually ascribed to\r\nhim, is fast being discarded by all thinkers. Therefore the basis must\r\nbe sought elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe universe is ruled in uniform ways. Special enactments for special\r\ncontingencies are inconsistent with our conception of the nature of that\r\ngeneral law by which all is governed. This alone is inferable, when\r\nviewed with the conclusions previously arrived at, that things of which\r\nwe can be conscious are unitary in origin and in ultimate effect.\r\nSupreme rule is removed beyond the pale of vicissitudes of time and\r\ncircumstance. The deduction, then, is that the cause of physical life is\r\nuniversally the same, the manifestations being varied according to the\r\nproperties involved in them. Does life then consist of anything more\r\nthan this uniform Basis Power?\r\n\r\nThe world of mind demands facts, not theories. Truth is no longer\r\nfeared, no matter how terribly it may shock the sensibilities of the\r\nreligiously-educated and philosophically-dwarfed intellect. Let us have\r\ntruth, then, even if it strips away the last of our preconceived\r\nopinions. The cry for more light continues to extend. You who cannot yet\r\nendure its brightness hide yourselves behind clouded dogmas, creeds and\r\ntheories. We know no creed but that which declares that an infinite,\r\ninscrutable Power is the life of all things, material and spiritual; we\r\nknow no dogma save that life is the operation of this Power; we know no\r\ntheory but that which makes clear the laws and modes by which these\r\noperations are governed.\r\n\r\nDiscarding, then, all dogmas, the growing minds strikes boldly out for\r\ntruth, and he who catches but faint glimpses of it badly performs his\r\nduty if he attempts to hide it from his brothers. If in its attainment\r\nthe Church crumbles, why falter? If governments totter, why falter?\r\nWhatever will be crushed out by new discoveries and publication of truth\r\nhas already performed its mission. Suppose, for example, that the\r\ngrossest materialism ever conceived of was absolutely true, would it not\r\nbe best that the world should be convinced of its truth? It speaks\r\nlittle for any system of religion or philosophy that it cannot bear the\r\nlight of facts, but evades, shuts out, or hurls anathemas at that which\r\nit cannot refute. Such a course stands condemned before the tribunal of\r\na progressive philosophy. The very effort of a late institution in\r\nopposition to physical freedom precipitated upon it its own destruction;\r\nsuch will doubtless be the result of an attempt now being made by a\r\npowerful institution to rivet religious bondage upon its subjects.\r\n\r\nIn continuing this subject, extracts will be made from Prof. Huxley’s\r\nlecture, “The New Theory of Life, or Matter the Basis of Vitality,” to\r\nshow that science has demonstrated that “life” is the same everywhere;\r\nand though he disclaims materialistic philosophy, the tendency of these\r\nextracts is in that direction. While matter must be looked to for all\r\nexpression of facts, it must not be overlooked that the realm of power\r\nor spirituality is the producing cause; consequently, while allowing\r\nscience full scope in analyzing, demonstrating and systematizing facts,\r\nreligion must not be despoiled of its basis idea which remains immovably\r\nfixed in consciousness. The Professor says: “I have translated the term\r\n_Protoplasm_, which is the scientific name of the substance I am about\r\nto speak of by the words ‘The Physical Basis of Life.’ * * * * To many,\r\nthe idea that there is such a thing as a physical basis or matter of\r\nlife may be novel. * * * Even those who are aware that matter and life\r\nare inseparably connected may not be prepared for the conclusion plainly\r\nsuggested by the phrase ‘The Physical Basis of Life.’” After giving\r\nvarious illustrations, drawn from nearly every department of nature,\r\ngrasping contrasts and dissimilarities, he adds: “I propose to\r\ndemonstrate that, notwithstanding these apparent difficulties, a\r\nthree-fold unity—a unity of power or faculty, a unity of form and a\r\nunity of substantial composition, does pervade the whole living\r\nworld; * * that the complicated and multifarious activities of man are\r\ncomprehensible under three categories—either they are immediately\r\ndirected toward the maintenance and development of the body, or they are\r\nto effect transitory changes in the relative positions of parts of the\r\nbody; or they tend toward the continuance of the species. Even the\r\nmanifestation of intellect, of feeling and of will, are not excluded\r\nfrom the classification.”\r\n\r\nProf. Huxley then illustrates the action of the _protoplasm_ in the\r\ncommon nettle and in the drop of blood, showing that both plants and\r\nanimals have their origin in a particle of nucleated _protoplasm_, and\r\nthat this _protoplasm_ “not only dies and is resolved into its mineral\r\nand lifeless constituents, but is always dying, and strange as the\r\nparadox may seem, could not live unless it died.” Thus we are led to the\r\nconclusion that all matter has a common basic principle by which we\r\nobtain our evidences of it. It is equally clear that analysis fails to\r\ngrapple this principle, for the process dissipates the power that\r\ncompelled the combination. Dead _protoplasm_ differs from living in that\r\nsomething has departed from it, and though we cannot catch this to\r\ndecide upon its nature, can we with consistency say it is a property of\r\nmatter? If it is, what has become of it that it does not manifest itself\r\nagain upon the recombination of the matter it once made use of? One fact\r\nis evident, and seems to be conclusive. This life principle never\r\nmanifests itself through artificial combinations of matter. Again, is\r\nthere no difference between ordinary matter and “matter of life?” What\r\nchanges the former into the latter, and _vice versa_? If chemical\r\nanalysis can tell us nothing about the composition of living matter,\r\nwhat can it tell us of life itself? If nucleated _protoplasm_ is the\r\nbasis of all life, and yet nothing but matter, why does one “structural\r\nunit” of it produce a plant, another an animal? While it is evident that\r\nthe material composition of these units is uniform, it seems to be quite\r\nabsurd to say that chemical analysis teaches everything that they\r\ncomprehend.\r\n\r\nIf the manifestations of matter are the result of its properties, the\r\nlaw must be of general application. Water always seeks its level: is\r\nthat a property of water or the result of gravitation? Water can be\r\nexpanded into vapor: is this a property of water or the result of the\r\nintroduction of heat? Is it a property of matter that transfers the\r\ndigestible and animal food we eat into man? Does man exhibit nothing but\r\nthe properties of matter? It is evident that after the strictest\r\nchemical analysis the vital life principle common to all matter remains\r\nunreached—thus indicating its great ultimate character, which is beyond\r\nthe reach of both chemical and mental analysis.\r\n\r\nWhat is this power by which the nucleated _protoplasm_ of the various\r\nspecies always produces representatives of the one which furnished the\r\ngerm? If it were simply a property of nucleated _protoplasm_, considered\r\nas matter, why should not a germ from the lion just as readily produce a\r\nlamb? In the various crosses between animals, the aggregated masses of\r\n_protoplasm_ partaking of both, the inference plainly is that in each of\r\nthe particles of _protoplasm_ was contained a power which controlled\r\ntheir successive aggregations and modifications. Other evidence that the\r\ndetermining power is something more than a mere property of matter is\r\nfound in the fact that if the young of several different species of\r\nanimals be reared in company and fed with the same material, they will\r\neach retain the peculiarities of the species they represent, modified\r\nsomewhat by the community of influence exerted on them. The same is true\r\nof the offspring of different races and nations.\r\n\r\nThe law indicated is still more generally applicable, descending as it\r\ndoes from the wide range of species and nations to each individual\r\nmember thereof. Upon different individuals the same cause, acting under\r\nlike circumstances, produces different effects, and this difference is\r\ndependent upon something more persistent than matter which is constantly\r\nchanging. Is this persistent individuality a property of the matter we\r\npossess now, or of that which we shall be made up of some years hence?\r\nThe consciousness of each one answers that this individuality is\r\nsuperior to the vicissitudes of matter—this consciousness having this\r\npeculiarity over its consciousness of the manifestations of matter, that\r\nwhile it constantly acquires new experiences it loses none of those\r\npreviously acquired.\r\n\r\nWe know nothing of this power, except that it is a name for an unknown\r\ncause: and so far as practical utility is concerned, the distinction\r\nbetween power and matter might be discarded, the danger of falling\r\nthereby into the slough of materialistic philosophy being avoided, if we\r\nremember that all the knowledge we can acquire is simply relative and\r\nsymbolic.\r\n\r\nReturning for a moment to the fact of reproduction, to ascertain if\r\npossible the determining power by which one “structural unit” of\r\nnucleated protoplasm develops into a beast, and another chemically\r\nidentical into a man, and realizing fully that this power is beyond\r\ncommon modes of proof we infer that a reasonable conclusion can only be\r\ndeduced from observing the general unchanging law of the constant\r\nrecurrence of similar results under similar circumstances. The first\r\nstep in the inquiry is to ask what “protoplasm” is, and how and where it\r\nis obtained.\r\n\r\nProf. Huxley informs us that its chemical constituents are carbon,\r\nhydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen, which form carbonic acid, water and\r\nammonia; and that these are compounded by plants into the “matter of\r\nlife” or protoplasm, which is the first compound of elements possessing\r\ninherent organic motion. This being the only way protoplasm can be\r\nproduced, we must always look to the vegetable world for continuous\r\nsupplies of it; and though we obtain it in large quantities from the\r\nanimal world, it is only at second-hand. In the vegetable world, then,\r\nmust we find the first traces of organic life. But though plants thus\r\nmanufacture protoplasm, they are not wholly protoplasm, but consist of\r\nvarious other elements necessary in an organized form. The manufacture\r\nof protoplasm may be considered the end of the vegetable world. This\r\nsubstance builds up the animal world, and forms a connecting link\r\nbetween the kingdoms.\r\n\r\nHow long it took protoplasm to produce its ultimate animal man we cannot\r\nascertain, but the numerous species and varieties thereof between the\r\nsimplest and most complete compounds signify a labor of which we can\r\nscarcely conceive, and yet science has traced and classified it all,\r\neach succeeding link in the chain being a little more complex, until man\r\nappears. As no higher types have been produced it is fair to presume\r\nthat none can be. The formula, then, that will present man will include\r\neverything below him in the order of creation, not only in the animal\r\nand vegetable kingdoms, but in the inorganic world upon which the\r\nvegetable is founded.\r\n\r\nIt remains to be observed that in the order of nature each of the\r\nvarious species of animals reproduces its kind, and gradually merges\r\ninto the next higher, but never recedes. Each species represents in\r\ndifferent proportions and numbers the “structural units,” from which,\r\nreproduction follows, each unit containing the life principle\r\nrepresentative of the general life principle of the animal from which it\r\ncomes. Now, it is predicated as a result of the study of nature that\r\nthis life principle is the determining power that controls the process\r\nwhereby protoplasm builds up such various and dissimilar material\r\nreforms. Dead protoplasm consists of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and\r\nnitrogen; living protoplasm, of these permeated and held together by\r\nthis life principle, and this differs in its controlling power according\r\nto the formations it has gone through. Thus the “structural unit” of the\r\nlion or of the horse, containing the life principle peculiar to each,\r\ndevelops into a lion or a horse, as the case may be, unless in this\r\nprocess it is furnished with living protoplasm containing a life\r\nprinciple of different determining powers, when the aggregate result is\r\na modification of the two powers.\r\n\r\nAgain, if the phenomena presented by matter are its absolute properties,\r\nthe same elements and combinations should always produce identical\r\nresults when taken into the human system. Do facts coincide with this?\r\nThis “matter of life” should, if it is simply matter, always produce\r\nsimilar effects from whatever source it is derived. It is a\r\nphysiological fact, however, that habitual living upon certain kinds of\r\nfood—all containing this identical “matter of life”—does produce\r\nheterogeneous effects, mental and physical, upon the system. Thus, if a\r\nperson who has constantly lived upon animal food changes his diet\r\nentirely to fruit and vegetables, a corresponding change will take place\r\nin his individual capacities.\r\n\r\nThe same point is well illustrated by a case which occurred in England,\r\nwhere saltpetre, obtained direct from the soil, was quite inert compared\r\nwith that obtained from animal substances, the cause of the difference\r\nbeing due to the tact that the latter, in passing through the animal\r\nkingdom, had acquired a power which it did not previously possess. This\r\nillustration is of general application. It is evident that matter, in\r\npassing through each successive and higher organic form, becomes\r\nimpregnated with the life principle which determines such form, and\r\nwhich manifests itself in all future combinations into which such matter\r\nenters.\r\n\r\nThe question now naturally arises, Is there a life principle common to\r\nall matter, which has become variously modified as the elements of\r\nmatter have become modified by having given rise to or passed through\r\nthe different changes and steps between its original homogeneous state\r\nand its present heterogeneous condition? Or are we to conclude that all\r\nmatter is dead, except that termed “matter of life?” That there is,\r\nconsequently, no life except organic life, and that this organic life is\r\na special creation entering into a single compound, which thereby raised\r\nto the dignity of “matter of life,” makes use of other elements as\r\nauxiliaries to its supreme rule? With all proper deference to “matter of\r\nlife,” we would ask, what do we know of life except as a result of\r\nmotion? and where can matter be found that does not manifest motion? and\r\nhow could the compound in which the “matter of life” is first found,\r\nhave been compounded without motion? If the life principle, manifested\r\nby protoplasm, is simply a property of matter, I see no logical reason\r\nwhy the motion existing in matter should not with equal propriety be\r\ncalled its property. This brings us to first principles, to the\r\nthreshold of elemental combination, for if this power determines the\r\nforms compounds shall assume, why should it not determine simple\r\nelemental form also?\r\n\r\nProtoplasm is the foundation of all organic life; and if we add to this\r\nthat this substance is itself the ultimate of a previous system of\r\nformation, the formula will express the whole. Yet it must not be\r\nforgotten that the building up of organic life is the result of a\r\nconstructive power common to the universe, and not indigenous to\r\nprotoplasm alone. It must then be apparent that there is a power common\r\nto all matter, of which the motion or life inherent in living protoplasm\r\nis but a modification; also, that the capacity of this common power for\r\nmodification is only limited by the necessary forms to represent it, and\r\nthe time required to develop them.\r\n\r\nIf this view of the power that pervades the universe is correct, the\r\nreal basis of life lies retrospectively far behind the motion contained\r\nin or manifested by the matter of life, and this motion, instead of\r\nbeing life of matter in its absolute sense, is but one of its modes of\r\nexpression. This homogeneous power common to matter still exists,\r\nundisturbed in extent, though most heterogeneously distributed in the\r\nformations which make up the present external universe.\r\n\r\nThe basis of physical life, then, is this power, and this power is the\r\nsame that was found to be unitary, though incomprehensible in its\r\nextent, while its manifestations are simply symbolic of that unlimited\r\npower which is alone attributable to the Unknowable, commonly designated\r\nGod. If this conclusion is not in accordance with the modes of\r\nmanifestation, there is no halting-place between it and the opposite\r\nextreme of the materialist that “there is no God”—that matter is all\r\nthere is in the universe. If materialistic philosophy involve “grave\r\nerror,” it becomes the duty of all who detect this tendency to preserve\r\nand point out the distinctions between the “matter of life” and the life\r\nof matter.\r\n\r\nIf the true province of philosophy is to discern the “soul of truth,”\r\nsaid to exist “in all erroneous things,” it ill becomes the ultra\r\nSpiritualist with a “soul of truth,” contained within his vast body of\r\nerrors, to denounce the ultra Materialist, who, if he has not the “soul\r\nof truth,” has a vast body of it. To the superficial thinker, the\r\nMaterialist may seem to be the more consistent of the two, as he can in\r\npart comprehend his truth, while the Spiritualist cannot. Whether one is\r\nmore or less consistent than the other matters not, so far as their\r\npredications are concerned.\r\n\r\nBut the ultra Spiritualist would show his consistency by descending to\r\nthe plane of the Materialist to find in his “body of truths” evidences\r\nof the handiwork of his God, which his ultra religious ideas fail to\r\nfurnish; and the ultra Materialist would show his by ascending to the\r\nplane of the Spiritualist to find in his “soul of truth” the key that\r\nshall transform his “body of truth” into living evidence of an unlimited\r\nPower entirely beyond the pale of matter or the keenest scientific\r\nanalysis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n             TENDENCIES AND PROPHECIES OF THE PRESENT AGE.\r\n\r\n        [Revised from the American Workman of October 9, 1869.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 NO. I.\r\n\r\nIt is eminently proper, before approaching the future of any subject, to\r\nmake strictest inquiry and most diligent search in and around its\r\npresent—to look with retrospective glance upon the convergent paths of\r\nthe past that have led to its present, and to catch the indices pointing\r\nonward; and, having found them, to judge whether such as Time’s\r\nunfolding calendar has left here and there along the pathway of passing\r\nevents were reliable prophecies of what was to come—were truthful\r\nindications of what was to follow. In the judgment determined and\r\nwarranted by the evidences obtained, a certain basis may be found upon\r\nwhich to predicate the prophecies of the living present.\r\n\r\nThe existing present is the absolute result of the eternal past; the sum\r\ntotal of all that has gone before; the product of God’s everlasting\r\nworkings, by and through unchangeable law upon the elemental material\r\nuniverse; nor can there be extracted from this result, this sum total,\r\nthis product, one simple separate effect which is not the legitimate\r\noffspring of the operation of immutable law, co-extensive with the\r\nuniverse, and co-existent with God.\r\n\r\nA proposition that there are powers within God’s realm which did not\r\nspring from Him, or that the Original Cause has, in the economy of\r\nNature, found it necessary to amend and change the original law, in\r\norder to accomplish His original purpose, or that contingencies have\r\narisen which have demanded special enactments on the part of the Divine\r\nRuler, presupposes that God did not know the end from the beginning, or,\r\nknowing it, was incompetent to provide therefor. Such a proposition,\r\nentertained by the human mind, destroys within it the God of the\r\nuniverse, and leaves the world, to it, a mere toy in the hands of its\r\nmaster, subject, at all times, to the caprices of his infinite rule, to\r\nbe led here and there by circumstances he knew not of previous to their\r\nexternal development.\r\n\r\nIt may be said, that reasoning upon the character of God’s government,\r\nor the mode through which he manifests himself to the world, is not\r\npertinent to the subject in view; to those who think thus the query\r\nshould be propounded—What of the _future_ without a reliable present?\r\nand what of the effects that must follow, if the operating, existing\r\ngeneral laws of the universe be not the same in a thousand years as now?\r\nIt becomes, then, extremely important that some permanent, unchangeable\r\nbasis be found before proceeding to predicate the future; and unless God\r\nis the same yesterday, to-day and forever, we can find no certain basis\r\nupon which to stand and from which we can start.\r\n\r\nWe have but to question the earth whether or not, from its incipiency\r\nonward through countless ages, it has obeyed the one great command,\r\nProgress? and in answer received, determine if, in the past, God has\r\nfound it necessary to change the great fundamental laws of the universe.\r\nGeology tells in unmistakable writings what the earth was; we have but\r\nto look about us to see what it is. At no time since _it was_ can we\r\nlearn that the law of progressive unfoldment has been inverted, and the\r\nworld turned backward toward its commencing point. Since this has not\r\noccurred in the past, we may safely assume that it will not occur in the\r\nfuture; the law of progress may be accepted as one of God’s immutable\r\ndecrees. The universe to-day, in all its variety and beauty, is no more\r\nin essence than it was millions of years ago, when it first assumed its\r\norbital movements; the same elements exist in the exact quantity—nothing\r\nadded—nothing taken away. Progress is simply a new arrangement of\r\nelementary principles.\r\n\r\nSimple elements are indestructible; when two or more are combined, and\r\nproduce an effect, the combination may be destroyed, and the elements\r\nseparated and returned to their natural condition. This process is not\r\none of destruction, but simply of change of the relations of the\r\nelements that formed the combination. An acorn deposited in the earth\r\nattracts to itself such elements as produce growth; after years of\r\nlabor, the mighty oak is the result. Although in its formation it has\r\ntaken from the earth and air certain properties, the same quantity of\r\nsuch proportions still exists—nothing new has been created, a new form\r\nonly has been produced by Nature, testifying that she never rests. Now,\r\nsuppose a power were applied to the oak to dissolve it, the oak only\r\nwould be destroyed, not the properties that entered into its\r\ncomposition.\r\n\r\nIt is supposed there are a certain number of elementary principles\r\ncontained in and that make up the material universe; were these\r\nprinciples simple units, incapable of divisibility, we could, by\r\napplying the rule of geometrical progression, soon arrive at the exact\r\nnumber of different combinations, and consequently the exact number of\r\ndifferent forms they are capable of producing; but, being infinite in\r\nquantity and divisibility, infinitude of form and effect is possible.\r\nThe power of arrangement being infinite, infinitude of association and\r\ncombination is the legitimate result.\r\n\r\nCombination and association began in the simplest forms! When God, by\r\nhis omnipotent voice, spoke the earth into existence, as an individual\r\nplanet, it contained exactly the same elements of which it is now\r\ncomposed; but they were simply in elemental form, without organization,\r\nand, consequently, without variety of manifestation in form; motion\r\nbeing an inherent quality, constant agitation brought the elements into\r\nrelations and combinations, simple at first; but by constant change they\r\narose from the simple to the complex, and from the complex toward the\r\ninfinite, and in the sum total of them we have the living present.\r\n\r\nThe argument does not require that minute examination of geological\r\nscience be made, following, one by one, the rise and fall, the\r\norganization and destruction of each of its classified periods, nor of\r\nthe specific results by and through each; but only to recognize _the\r\nlaw_ by which these results are arrived at. It is possible to so trace\r\nand classify these results as to show a continuous chain of progression,\r\nlink by link, from the simplest form of combination, to the most complex\r\nand perfect, wherein all the original elements were first\r\nrepresented—man! Having arrived at perfection of form, wherein all the\r\nproperties of the material world find themselves forming a part, it\r\nmight reasonably be accepted that progression in formation would cease;\r\nwhile it has ceased so far as producing higher types is concerned, it\r\nhas not in the quality of the types already produced; and in this\r\nproposition lies the greatest problem of life; the one most difficult\r\nfor the human mind to grasp. Man, representing in form all that has gone\r\nbefore, is the result of the grand chain of progressive material\r\nformations; and, having combined within his physical form a portion of\r\nevery element contained in the world, he may be likened in his infancy\r\nto the infancy of the earth. God, in spirit, pervades all material\r\nnature, and the union—if union it may be called—forms a perfect whole,\r\nand man being an epitome of all things contained in the material world,\r\nreceives into his organization the spirit of each of its representative\r\nconstituent parts, and consequently is endowed with all the spiritual\r\nattributes of the universe, the attributes of God! and, as God is\r\neternal, man, created in His image, must likewise be eternal.\r\n\r\nAs the earth, in its first efforts at organization, combined but few of\r\nits principles, and presented the crudest form, and as time rolled on\r\nand its combinations continued to include more and more of the several\r\nprinciples, so with man; in his infancy his spiritual manifestations\r\nwere crude in the extreme, but there has constantly been brought into\r\nco-operative combination, more and more of the spiritual principles, and\r\nhigher and higher types of spiritual manifestations have been the\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nIf man, as a unit, were analyzed to-day, he would be found to be made up\r\nspiritually of the elements corresponding to that age of the development\r\nof the physical world of which he is now the representative; that is to\r\nsay, in his manifestations spiritually, he exhibits the same ratio of\r\nspiritual elements that the earth did in her manifestations in material\r\nelements at the time in her growth corresponding with the present\r\ncondition and growth of man.\r\n\r\nIf cool and deliberate reason, unbiased by mythological and theoretical\r\ndogmas, be applied to the correspondence between the material and\r\nspiritual elements, the conclusion can scarcely fail to be arrived at,\r\nthat each primary element of the material universe is the external\r\nexpression and representative of a spiritual attribute of God; and as\r\nthere are a definite number of elements in nature, forming the perfect\r\n_material whole_, so there are an equal number of analagous spiritual\r\nelements that constitute the _spiritual whole_.\r\n\r\nAs the elements and their corresponding interior principles are\r\nsusceptible of infinite combinations and associations, the varied\r\nmanifestations of nature and man are readily accounted for. Nor should\r\nit be forgotten that each of the manifestations is the legitimate and\r\ninevitable result of the combination out of which it springs; and, as\r\nthe combination is not self-creative, but the result of the action of\r\nprogressive law, so the effect of the combination is but the outward\r\nexpression of the purposes contained within the law, behind the\r\nformation of the combination, and is thus the result of God’s operative\r\nlaw of progress.\r\n\r\nHaving argued thus far to show that the _present age_, material, mental\r\nand spiritual, is the legitimate result of the law of progressive\r\ndevelopment, the following propositions are deduced therefrom, forming a\r\nbasis or platform from which to ask of the present—What of the future?\r\nWhither doth it lead?\r\n\r\nFirst—All power, wherever manifested, is a unit.\r\n\r\nSecond—God is the source of all power, and the elements the subject of\r\nits application.\r\n\r\nThird—Each attribute of God has its corresponding material element.\r\n\r\nFourth—All the material elements constitute the material world; all the\r\nspiritual elements, God.\r\n\r\nFifth—There is nothing contained in creation outside of the power of\r\nGod, on the one hand, and the elementary principles on the other—the\r\nfirst positive, the last negative.\r\n\r\nSixth—Nothing can be added to what was; nothing taken away from what is.\r\n\r\nSeventh—All the diversities in nature are the legitimate effect of the\r\npower of God, operating through and upon different elements, and\r\ndifferent proportions of different elements, contained in nature, the\r\ndiversity being infinite, because the material and producing power are\r\ninfinite.\r\n\r\nEighth—Man, collectively, being the representative of all the material\r\nand spiritual elements, the individual diversities observed in him are\r\nthe legitimate result of the different relative proportions of these\r\nelements contained in his organization.\r\n\r\nNinth—The present is the result of spiritual principles acting upon and\r\nthrough the material elements during the eternal past.\r\n\r\nGiving a comprehensive glance at the world it will be seen that\r\n_government_ of some kind is everywhere established, which purports to\r\nrule the people embraced within certain geographical boundaries. An\r\nanalysis of each form, from the crudest and most barbarous up through\r\nall the modifications of civilized government, will discover that each\r\ngovernment was a true exponent of the character of the people by or over\r\nwhom it was established. Every country, as it advances in intellectual\r\nand moral development, demands modifications in its government adapted\r\nto the improved capacity of the people. Hence, as the character of the\r\ngoverned progresses, so must that of the government keep pace with that\r\nof the governed, else the power behind it will rise to its _might_, and\r\n_sweep it away_.\r\n\r\nThere is but little doubt that the government of this country is the\r\nhighest form now in existence on the earth; but to show how crude and\r\neven barbarous it is, reference only has to be made to the terrible\r\nconflict it has just survived, which became inevitable and necessary as\r\nthe only practical demonstration of the power of the principles upon\r\nwhich it purports to have been founded—that all men are born free and\r\nequal, and entitled to certain inalienable rights, among which are life,\r\nliberty and the pursuit of happiness. This proposition was made\r\nfundamental by great and good men, the representative lights of the\r\ncountry at that time, standing far in advance of the general mind.\r\nLiberty and equity had burst upon their souls under the sway of tyranny\r\nand oppression, which became so odious that anything was preferable to\r\nthem, to longer enduring its injustice. In this land, far removed from\r\nthat where freedom could not lift its head—with a mighty ocean rolling\r\nbetween, they felt they had found a secure asylum from further\r\noppression, and a land where their new-born hopes could be realized.\r\nBut, unfortunately, all who came to the _New World_ had not these hopes\r\nand anticipations; some there were who still desired the strong hand of\r\nthe tyrant to sway; and, thus invoked, it reached even across the mighty\r\ndeep, and sought anew to enslave these new-born sons of freedom.\r\nSubmission they never thought of—resistance was their only theme; and\r\nmost thoroughly did they resist; through the long conflict that ensued,\r\ncarried on by them under every conceivable disadvantage, their hopes\r\nnever completely died out; and at last—triumphant over the crown—freedom\r\nreigned!\r\n\r\nIt cannot be wondered at that souls rising from such a conflict as the\r\nRevolution, triumphant, should assert so broad a proposition in behalf\r\nof equality as they did at the commencement of the struggle; nor is it\r\nwonderful that the great majority of the people did not understand, or\r\ndid not have a full perception of the principle for which their\r\nrepresentatives periled their lives and fortunes and pledged their\r\nsacred honor; but principles which were but partially discerned by the\r\nFathers of the Republic have now grown into rules of action enforced by\r\nthe sanctions of fundamental law; slavery of the body is no longer\r\npossible; the verdict of the majority of the people proclaimed it\r\n“behind the age.”\r\n\r\nThe South, recognizing this fact, knew that separation from the\r\nprogressive mind of the North was the only chance for the continuance of\r\na system which furnished so many excuses for physical, mental and moral\r\nlethargy; and in their attempt to separate, they precipitated a conflict\r\nin which history repeated itself, and freedom came out triumphant; thus\r\nwhat sprung from the seeds of tyranny and oppression, left scattered\r\nhere and there by those who made that broad declaration, have been\r\nfinally uprooted, and never more can take root and flourish under the\r\nscorching blaze of freedom’s noontide sun.\r\n\r\nThat physical, mental and spiritual lethargy was the condition of the\r\nSouth under the system of slavery all statistics touching this point\r\nindisputably attest; and the verdict of fifty years will pronounce the\r\nabolition of their system the greatest blessing God has yet vouchsafed\r\nthem; it has opened the door of progress for all things, material and\r\nspiritual, and has rescued from the barbaric chains of the past a\r\ncountry more favored by God, in the bestowal of natural advantages, than\r\nany other on the face of the globe.\r\n\r\nThe general love of freedom, because it is an inherent right, is one of\r\nthe first evidences the soul presents that it is growing from the\r\nboundaries and control of the material, from which it sprang, into those\r\nof the spiritual toward which it tends. When this love first takes root\r\nthe soul has attained that degree of development wherein the spiritual\r\nhas the superior control of the individual, resulting from the\r\npredominance of the spiritual over the material.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the general sentiment of the country demanded that slavery\r\nshould no longer exist within its boundaries, is a very significant one,\r\nwhen considered in connection with the tendencies and prophecies of the\r\npresent; it shows that the capacity and desire for freedom is being\r\nrapidly developed in the human soul; it indicates that the mind begins\r\nto appreciate what freedom really guarantees to its votaries in its\r\nbroadest signification; it begins to recognize the glorious truth that\r\nevery soul will, sooner or later, demand and receive all its rights.\r\n\r\nThe demands of public sentiment, which have already resulted in\r\nmodifications of the constitution of the country, will not stop at the\r\ndoor of African slavery, which it has thrown wide open; there are many\r\nother systems of slavery still left to be abolished; while they do not\r\nall enslave the body, they so fetter the soul and the mind, that their\r\ninfluence is even more pernicious and galling than the enslavement of\r\nthe body.\r\n\r\nThe African slave, toiling under the burning sun in the cotton, rice and\r\nsugar plantations of the South, was virtually in possession of more\r\nfreedom of soul than are many of the white race, even in our own midst.\r\nLook into these things, and see if, while you have “cast the mote out of\r\nyour brother’s eye,” you have not a “_beam_” in your own; these, however\r\nnumerous, will in turn and time demand of the people and of the\r\ngovernment, when in its province, such attention as may be required to\r\nextend freedom in all directions where “life, liberty and the pursuit of\r\nhappiness” legitimately lead.\r\n\r\nThe history of the past as well as the tendencies of the present\r\nprophecy with distinctness and positiveness that the demand will soon go\r\nout, not only for a government founded on equal rights to all, but whose\r\nlaws shall be administered with justice and equity, guaranteeing freedom\r\nof body, mind and soul to every living intelligence.\r\n\r\nFrom evidences rapidly accumulating, it is believed that this country is\r\nripening for such a form and administration of government; but in the\r\npresent condition of society and of servitude to its customs, the\r\nimperfect and partial manner of arriving at representation, and of\r\nmaking and administering law, such a reform cannot be inaugurated; that\r\nis to say, although such a reform would be acceptable to and welcomed by\r\nthe country, and will soon be demanded by it, as yet it is impossible to\r\norganize an effort, strictly within itself, that could effect it,\r\nbecause there is not a sufficient concentration of understanding upon\r\nthe requirements to be met, nor of wisdom enough to draft for these\r\nrequirements adequate laws and forms of administration. Were such a code\r\nprepared and submitted to the people, do you think it would be rejected?\r\n\r\nIn the earlier days of the republic legislation seems to have been\r\nconducted upon constitutional principles; but in these latter days it\r\nhas so far departed from its seeming mainsprings of action that it is\r\nsafe to assert that legislation, founded strictly upon considerations of\r\nprinciples of justice and right, is unknown in the land. If sometimes a\r\ngreat principle is demonstrated through legislation, it will invariably\r\nbe found upon strict investigation, that the legislation was not\r\npredicated upon the principle, but upon some personal or party benefit\r\nexpected to flow therefrom; the _principle_, therefore, stands under\r\nobligation to the expected benefit, and to the party _needing_ it, and\r\nwill doubtless, in its impartial operations, _remember_ them. While this\r\ncondition is a perfectly legitimate one, flowing from adequate producing\r\ncauses, there are individual minds and souls, by thousands, who rise in\r\ntheir capacities for government out of it, and demand reform and the\r\nessential truth of Principle.\r\n\r\nGovernment may be compared to an individual who, having committed some\r\ninfringement upon the law of justice, is impelled, by the position it\r\nforces him into, to continue the practice to sustain himself from\r\nfalling; but as a system of injustice cannot be perpetual, fail he must,\r\nsooner or later; and the longer it is delayed, the more complete will be\r\nthe wreck and ruin when it comes;—as with the individual, so it must be\r\nwith the State. Once started upon a system of law-making and executing\r\nnot founded upon principles of justice and right, the course must be\r\npursued and sustained by further enactments, either to _cover_ the\r\ndeformities of the previous proceeding or _hide_ its purposes, and\r\nunless righteous judgment come to the rescue before the course has led\r\nto wide-spread and apparent corruption throughout all its channels of\r\nadministration, it must eventually culminate in the downfall of the\r\ngovernment, if not in the destruction of the nation.\r\n\r\nPolicy, not principle, is the ruling power behind all present\r\nlegislation. Policy, inevitably and indiscriminately, leads to\r\ncorruption. Corruption, obeying the inherent laws of its own nature,\r\nuntouched by and beyond the control of the enactments that first gave it\r\nlife and afterward fostered its growth, must culminate in certain\r\ndestruction to all parts involved, whether it be within the body human,\r\nthe body corporate or the body politic.\r\n\r\nDid the Republican party, as a party, desire the freedom of the negro\r\nsimply and solely because it was one of his natural rights? Would\r\nfreedom have been extended to him by that party had it been positively\r\nknown that all his influence would be used against it? Or would the\r\nDemocratic party, as a party, have opposed the enfranchisement of the\r\nnegro had it been known that he would become its political ally?\r\n\r\nJudging from the indices of the past, it is fair to suspect, at least,\r\nif not to conclude, that the Republican party is expecting another such\r\nexigency as existed when it was found politic to extend freedom and\r\nsuffrage to the negro; and in the question of female suffrage, for which\r\nthe demand is now being earnestly made, there is but little doubt that\r\nit sees another means of salvation in the future, and seeks to postpone\r\nthe question until the exigency shall become more imminent and\r\ndangerous. It may be argued that the Republican party was organized upon\r\nthe principles of freedom. If this were wholly true, it would be also\r\ntrue that it had no sooner become a party in power than it resolved\r\nitself into a tribunal to define the limits for the application of the\r\nvery principles that had placed it in power; thereby endeavoring to\r\nprostitute the principle to subserviency to the policy of its leaders,\r\ninstead of calmly and firmly following where it would legitimately lead;\r\nlike all parties and sects, of previous origin, it built upon a\r\nprinciple, and then, instead of wisely following, recklessly attempted\r\nto guide it.\r\n\r\nWith all the prestige of possession, and of being the acknowledged\r\nrepresentative of the principle which had carried it into power, the\r\nresult of the late elections began to be feared by the party, because\r\nits leaders knew they had driven it from its birthright, and led it\r\nafter strange gods; and, had the opposing party been actuated by true\r\nprogressive principles of justice, no man, however popular in himself,\r\ncould have saved it from destruction.\r\n\r\nConscious of having departed from the principles that gave it power, the\r\nRepublican party is even now seeking every means within its grasp to\r\nfortify itself behind measures looking solely to success in ’72; but it\r\nis prophesied that ere that time there will have sprung into existence\r\nanother party that will not be the mere professed representative of\r\nfreedom and equal rights to all, but the actual, living, moving,\r\nirresistible incarnation of those principles.\r\n\r\nThe lines of policy pursued by party leaders, and the channels of\r\ncorruption opened by the executive officers of the government, have\r\nproduced a result so wide-spread in its influence and ramifications\r\nthat, instead of their being under the control of the government, they\r\nexert a vast if not controlling power over all its actions; it is not\r\nnecessary to go beyond its own records to establish this fact; every\r\nnewspaper in the country teems with evidence in point; the clergy have\r\ndeemed the situation dangerous enough to hurl the anathemas of the\r\nChurch against it; the dramatist and the artist, the poet and the\r\nphilosopher, have each dealt his blow, while the “toiling millions”\r\neverywhere cry for reform.\r\n\r\nSo general and earnest has the demand for reform become that something\r\nmust be done; the gathering masses of corruption all over the body will\r\nsoon have ripened to bursting; and who can tell how much the body itself\r\nhas become involved. May it not be feared that it does not possess\r\nsufficient recuperative purity and strength to stand the shock? Could\r\nthe enlightened mental, moral and spiritual elements of the country\r\nwhich are possessed by those who stand in the front ranks of the\r\nadvancing column of progress be combined into organized action, they\r\nmight be able to arrest the abnormal growth of corruption, and, by\r\nstrengthening and stimulating the sound members of the body to\r\nco-operative action, restore the whole system to its normal condition.\r\n\r\nThe machinery of the government has become so complex and unwieldy—so\r\nfull of departmental and petty offices—that it is utterly beyond the\r\npower of one man, though he be “_a great and mighty_ President,” to\r\nunderstand and control it.\r\n\r\nThe tendencies of the government being dangerous to the liberties of the\r\npeople, their demand for reform is earnest, and must be heeded. But\r\nwhere will reformation begin? To whom must we look for relief? If we go\r\nto Congress with the Constitution in our hands, and demand such\r\nlegislation as would give practical efficiency to the preamble and\r\ncharter of freedom, they may possibly pay sufficient attention to the\r\nsubject to pass a joint resolution setting forth that, while certain\r\ninalienable rights seem to be guaranteed to all, still Congress must be\r\nthe dispensing power and judge of its application; and that it has\r\ndecided that the negro shall be the first on the list—next, perhaps, the\r\nIndian may come in—next the Chinaman, and all the ends of the\r\nearth—except woman. Yes, go to Congress for relief from onerous taxes,\r\nwrung from the blood and bones of the laboring poor to fill the coffers\r\nof government vampires, and they will answer you by passing some new\r\n_Revenue Act_, in whose cunningly prepared articles will be found traps\r\nset for the people’s money, which the trained bands of political party\r\nsecretly manage on joint account for themselves and their party leaders;\r\nit will answer you by granting new subsidies to corporations already\r\ngrown rich from the fruits of the labor of the people; by granting to\r\npowerful monopolies still further privileges increasing their power\r\nthrough bribery and corruption to make subordinate the welfare of the\r\ncountry to their own selfish purposes, and by favoring all schemes for\r\nthe _centralization of power_. Such being the answers to your demands,\r\nthere is still a tribunal to which you can appeal, which in all time\r\npast has heard and answered the _demands of the age_.\r\n\r\nIn the system of _special_ and _class_ legislation causes of corruption\r\nand the downfall of governments may always be found; it is the bane of\r\nthe nations, whence flows that subtle, entrancing poison that permeates\r\nall the arteries and veins of a country—so quietly and alluringly to the\r\npeople, that, before its effects are suspected, the vital principle of\r\nthe government is destroyed, and the lifeless form finally falls to rise\r\nno more forever; or, if the spiritless form be still upheld by the\r\nusurper, it is only retained as “a cheat and a delusion” to shield the\r\nperson of the tyrant who has enslaved his victims in the name and under\r\nthe guise of liberty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n             TENDENCIES AND PROPHECIES OF THE PRESENT AGE.\r\n\r\n         [Revised from the American Workman of Oct. 16, 1870.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                NO. II.\r\n\r\nThe subject of government and the solution of all its difficulties seem\r\nto hinge upon the question, Where does God’s government drop its sway\r\n(if it does so at all), and where does man take it up, on his own\r\naccount, by inherent natural right, guaranteed to him by the law that\r\ngave him being? The only modification of this question required to be\r\nconsidered is, How far man is or can be the authorized, competent agent\r\nof the Almighty in working out His purposes? To solve all these\r\nquestions it becomes necessary to determine what the fundamental\r\nprinciples of government must be, to be in harmony with the laws of God,\r\nand to adopt them and to follow them out to all their legitimate\r\nconclusions and results, discarding everything else. In such government\r\nand legislation the eternal principles of right, which are God’s laws,\r\nare in full force and effect, and _man_, thus far, an authorized\r\ncompetent agent in the administration of His decrees in the material\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nWhether a government founded or administered upon any other basis than\r\nthe eternal principles of right and justice can or cannot be enduring,\r\nis a proposition the simplest mind may solve. Progress is from the lower\r\nto the higher; in its certain and irresistible march all systems and\r\nthings that have risen out of the circumstances of the times to which\r\nthey belong will be swept away to make room for the new and the better;\r\nbut principles and self-evident truths that were contained in such\r\nsystems will endure to be incorporated into all future systems.\r\n\r\nThere can be no higher form of expression than that life, liberty and\r\nthe pursuit of happiness are “_inalienable_” rights to _all_; and, being\r\nsuch, it is safe to assume that it will always remain as a fundamental\r\nproposition in the organic law of this country; and legislation will be\r\nrequired to guide itself by it, instead of being its exponent.\r\n\r\nChange upon change will come in the future, as it has in the past, until\r\ngovernment will become so simplified as to have for its foundation\r\nnothing but an annunciation of general principles of justice and equity,\r\nas self-evident truths upon which all legislation must be based.\r\n\r\nPassing, for a time, the consideration of the principles of government,\r\nit may be well to inquire into the injustice of some of its present\r\ndetails. All men, and women, too, are _born_ free and equal, entitled to\r\ncertain natural rights, which no government has the right to take from\r\nthem. While every man and woman is a result of the general law of\r\nprocreation, there are distinguishing points peculiar to each, which\r\nrenders every _one_ different from every _other_; thus no two persons\r\ncan be so precisely alike as to make their individuality the same;\r\nconsequently no two persons are governed by the same internal and\r\nexternal mainsprings of action and influence. Let the same power and\r\ninfluence be exerted upon different individuals, no matter how nearly\r\nthey may _resemble_ each other, different results will flow from each,\r\nthe character of which will be absolutely determined by the status of\r\nthe development of, and the relations between the material, and\r\nspiritual elements represented in the individuals acted upon. No\r\nargument is needed to prove this proposition; and the legitimate\r\ndeduction to be drawn from it is, that no judgment of the action of the\r\nindividual, by others, is just that does not take into consideration all\r\nthe various points in character and influence under which action is\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\nIt must not be forgotten that all thought and action on the part of an\r\nindividual is the legitimate result of some competent producing cause,\r\noperating by natural law. The cause being competent, the law of\r\noperation natural, and the result consequently legitimate, can another’s\r\nidea of right step in to sit in judgment over the action, and render a\r\nverdict of justice to the actor? Or, can any number of individuals\r\ndetermine what the demands of justice are which God himself has declared\r\nby the mouth of all His holy prophets, material and spiritual. “Judgment\r\nis mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.”\r\n\r\nNo one can hope to escape the judgments of the eternal law, or to hide\r\nhimself from God’s officers of justice; but must by them be brought\r\nbefore its stern, undeviating bar, to receive its unpardonable sentence.\r\nBut, says the objector, this does not satisfy me, who have suffered from\r\nthe offence. What if it does not satisfy you? God is satisfied; and are\r\nyou greater than He, that you may question His justice? If you are not\r\nyet satisfied, God will most surely satisfy you in His own good time.\r\n\r\nLook into your statutes, and within them, find their own stultification.\r\nThey assert that no criminal shall be subjected to two trials and\r\npenalties for the same offence; but, in the face of this righteous rule,\r\nand with the positive knowledge that God has already tried, convicted\r\nand sentenced the murderer, the courts of the country take possession\r\nand control of the criminal, proceed to try, convict, condemn and hang\r\nhim by the neck until he is dead. Rest assured God will not overlook\r\nthis attempt of yours to forestall his judgments.\r\n\r\nWe stop here to make a broad assertion: For man to affix certain\r\ndefinite penalties as punishment for so-called crime is to arrogate to\r\nhimself what alone belongs to God!\r\n\r\nStumbling-blocks are constantly found in the path of progress, against\r\nwhich the earnest traveler finds himself precipitated; these consist of\r\nthe ideas of the past, clothed with form and expression, and which were\r\nset up by their conceivers as “guides and lights” of their times, for\r\nthose who groped their way by such assistance. The earnest seeker after\r\nlight finds these set up all along his path, declaring “thus far shalt\r\nthou go, and no farther;” but he, catching a glimpse of the light so\r\nbright beyond, clears the obstruction by a single bound, and goes on his\r\nway rejoicing, seldom deeming it his duty to turn upon and cast what to\r\nhim was but a hindrance from the path of progress, so that others coming\r\nthat way should not encounter it, who perhaps might lack the power to\r\nsurmount it. “Let your light shine” so that those who come after you may\r\nbe aided thereby.\r\n\r\nA single argument upon the question of the relations between debtor and\r\ncreditor, which is maintained by the present laws, will be sufficient to\r\nillustrate the whole subject of customs, authorities and laws, which are\r\nobstructions in the path of progress. The time was when imprisonment for\r\ndebt was authorized by law in all the States of this land of freedom\r\n(?); but the spirit of progressive justice has been at work until but\r\nfew of the States now retain this libel upon Christian civilization to\r\ndisgrace their statutes. Imprisonment for debt! What good ever resulted\r\nfrom it? The malignity of the creditor may have satisfied itself by\r\nstill further humiliating the broken spirits of the debtor; but the\r\ncreditor, by such action, places it still further beyond the power of\r\nthe unfortunate debtor to satisfy the demand. It is asserted, without\r\nfear of successful contradiction, that the same deleterious effects\r\ngenerally flow from all similar laws. All kinds of crime are but species\r\nof debt, and the same rule applies with about the same force to its laws\r\nand penalties. Imprisonment for debt has been pretty generally\r\nabolished, but still our statute books are laden with laws to enforce\r\ncollection.\r\n\r\nA philosopher and economist, not long ago, fully investigated the\r\nrelations between debtor and creditor, and the practical results of the\r\nlaws now in force, and arrived at the “deliberate conclusion” that the\r\ncosts attending the attempts to collect debts by legal process were\r\nthree times the amount collected; not a very flattering commentary upon\r\nthe policy of the law, and certainly not a paying investment to the\r\ncrediting part of our community. This conclusion may at first thought\r\nappear fallacious; but when the expensiveness of courts, and the immense\r\nincomes of lawyers who practice at their bars, are considered, the\r\nafterthought will fully sustain the conclusion. It is believed by many\r\nthat if there were no laws at all to enforce collection, there would be\r\nmany less _bad debts_; even now a debt of honor is held by public\r\nopinion to have precedence of those which the _law_ claims the right to\r\nenforce.\r\n\r\nThe thinker of ordinary capacity will see at a glance that an immense\r\namount of labor would be withdrawn from the courts, which now bears\r\nheavily upon the people, not only in the form of taxes to pay for\r\ncourt-houses, jury-rooms and judges’ salaries, but in the waste of time\r\nemployed in jury-boxes by men dragged from their inevitable toil, and\r\nheld as prisoners, while their wives and children are often suffering,\r\nand even dying, from the want of their care and attention at home.\r\nContracts should be so well defined as to admit of no misunderstanding;\r\nand if there was no method of collection and enforcement, there would be\r\nvery many less disagreements; hence, in no light in which it can be\r\nviewed, does our present system commend itself to the wisdom and justice\r\nof the reflecting; on the contrary, it throws open the door for cunning\r\nand knavery to enter to test their strength through technical evasions\r\nand blind inferences, practiced, on the unwary and ignorant by the\r\n“_Quirks_, the _Gammons_ and the _Snaps_,” who, as _vampires_ of the\r\ntime-honored profession they disgrace, feed and fatten upon the\r\nmisfortunes of the deluded, long-forbearing, long-suffering _children of\r\ntoil_.\r\n\r\nIt may be safely asserted that a very large part of _all law_ contained\r\nwithin the statutes of the world, when analyzed, will present about the\r\nsame deleterious results in practice and in the opportunities presented\r\nfor infringement and subsequent evasion of their penalties that\r\ninevitably flow from all laws for the collection of debts.\r\n\r\nThe time has probably not yet come for the abolishment of all such laws,\r\nbut the time has come when the relations of individual debtors and\r\ncreditors should be left to the control of general principles of\r\njustice, which declare that a contract once fairly made, an obligation\r\nonce fairly incurred, can never be discharged until satisfaction shall\r\nhave been entered upon the record by divine justice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n             TENDENCIES AND PROPHECIES OF THE PRESENT AGE.\r\n\r\n         [Revised from the American Workman of Oct. 30, 1870.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                NO. III.\r\n\r\nWhen it is considered, how much the useful portion of life is dependent\r\nupon the preparatory part, the character of the influences brought to\r\nbear during that part, and the manner of their application, become a\r\nsubject of deep importance. Education has received the most special\r\nattention from scholars, savants and professors; but they seem to have\r\nforgotten or to have ignored the fact that within the mind is contained\r\nthe germ of all acquirements, and that teaching by rule merely what\r\nothers have said or written, cramps and dwarfs the mind which, under a\r\nmore natural system, would more rapidly and more healthfully develop its\r\nlatent powers, through its stimulated efforts to evolve ideas connected\r\nwith such facts and phenomena as may be exhibited to it, and thus become\r\na part of the mind itself.\r\n\r\nInstead of training the mind to rely upon method, books and authorities\r\nas rules, it should be encouraged to form methods of its own. The mind\r\nshould be questioned, and its answers listened to, instead of being\r\nfurnished by the teacher.\r\n\r\nThe mode proposed has many decided advantages. It inspires\r\nself-reliance, disciplines the mind to think for itself, accustoms it to\r\nexpress its own conclusions in its own chosen language, leads to clear\r\nand comprehensive forms of expression, gives decision and confidence,\r\nand tends to produce individuality of thought and character.\r\n\r\nThe Children’s Progressive Lyceum, instituted upon this idea, has\r\nalready been inaugurated, and should receive the careful and\r\nunprejudiced attention of all interested in educational reform. Children\r\nwho have been under this system but a few months are able to stand\r\nbefore an audience, and, in a clear and comprehensive manner, speak\r\nwithout embarrassment upon any subject comprehended by their minds. The\r\ncoming generations will acknowledge a debt of gratitude to the founder\r\nof this system which no depth of respect or reverence could fully\r\nexpress.\r\n\r\nNo proposition can be made which will be more readily accepted by the\r\ngeneral progressive mind than that, as the world advances in knowledge\r\nand wisdom, its general welfare becomes more and more dependent upon\r\nreciprocal interests; that is to say, as _persons_ and _nations_ become\r\nmore and better individualized, their reliance upon interests outside of\r\nthemselves becomes more positively and distinctly defined; thus a system\r\nof mutual dependence and reciprocal interests is every day being more\r\nwidely inaugurated, which will continue to spread until the whole world\r\nwill be brought into harmonious co-operation. This is _commerce_!\r\nCommerce, to the material world, is what thought is to the\r\nspiritual—interchange and exchange of material product in the one and of\r\nspiritual in the other—hence no restrictions or embargoes should be\r\nplaced on the one which would not be legitimate if placed upon the\r\nother. The dependence and independence of each is mutual and general.\r\n\r\nRestrictions upon commerce is a system of commercial slavery, flowing\r\nfrom _politic_ and _special_ legislation, and is in violation of the\r\neternal principles of right, because it renders equality in interchange\r\nimpossible. If it is the right principle to restrict commerce between\r\nnations, it extends to States, to cities and to individuals as well.\r\n\r\nUnder the rule of an unrestricted commercial intercourse throughout the\r\nworld, the principle of supply and demand would control the movements of\r\ncommerce without the aid of legislation; and, when once fully\r\nestablished, it would give stability and security to production\r\neverywhere. The products of the world entering into commerce would\r\nlocalize themselves where they naturally belong—where most could be\r\nproduced with the least labor; and, population obeying the laws of\r\nequalization, would adjust itself to the demands of the respective\r\ninterests of productive labor. This is a vast problem, in the solution\r\nof which the whole world is vitally interested, and one which, sooner or\r\nlater, must be solved. If its solution were possible _now_, coming\r\ngenerations would look back and bless us for the solving. An\r\ninternational congress should be called to consider the subject, and to\r\ntake proper measures for the inauguration of a system of general economy\r\nin production and consumption. The prophecies of the age point to this\r\nas a reform of sufficient magnitude to demand the immediate attention of\r\nthe nations, and to call for a _Christ_ to rise up for their salvation\r\nmore powerful than the Democratic Party.\r\n\r\nThe political, national or personal advantages which are supposed to\r\nflow from restraints upon commerce, have nothing to do with the question\r\nof general reform. While it is the duty of every nation and every\r\nindividual person to press forward the work of reform upon general\r\nprinciples, each nation and person must always keep in view the law of\r\n_self-preservation_, otherwise individuality will be lost in the\r\nstruggle for supremacy, which has hitherto characterized the legislation\r\nof nations and the conduct of individual persons. The great principle of\r\nunrestricted universal commerce can only be practically established by\r\nuniversal acquiescence in its wisdom and justice. When legislation shall\r\nconform itself to general principles, instead of sectional, local or\r\npersonal policy, and when its course shall be shaped by such broad\r\naction, it may be safely prophesied that the government it represents\r\nwill be perfect and perpetual. Commerce will then obey the law of\r\nprogress, and rise from the petty policies of nations, which strangle\r\nits development and limit its benefits: it will rise to be conducted\r\nupon the dignity of principle, untrammeled by policy; and on this\r\nplatform the world will unite in harmonious prosperity under a universal\r\ngovernment, not limited even by the boundaries between the material and\r\nthe spiritual world.\r\n\r\nUnderlying all advancement and prosperity, material and spiritual, is\r\naction—motion—which, guided by intellect, results in _labor_, without\r\nwhich the world would be as though man had never been; for no form of\r\ncreature below him has ever left permanent artificial beauty, systems of\r\neconomy or usefulness as the result of its workings, except in so far as\r\nthe form itself may be accounted such.\r\n\r\nWhat, in two hundred years, has so changed the face of this country from\r\nthe wilderness it was to the teeming garden it is, dotted all over with\r\nthe habitations of men? What has produced the floating palaces that\r\neverywhere walk its deep waters “like a thing of life?” What has united\r\nall its distant parts by iron bands, along whose guiding lines those\r\nother representatives of _art_ and _motion_ speed, almost outstripping\r\nthe wind? What has overcome time and space, and is now extending its\r\narms to embrace the globe, that we may speak, and that the ends of the\r\nearth answer our call? Marvelous demonstration of the rapidly growing\r\nmutual and reciprocal dependence of the children of men! What has made\r\nthe wilderness to blossom as the rose? What has achieved all these\r\nglorious, god-like results? Labor! labor! labor! physical, mental and\r\nspiritual labor!\r\n\r\nLabor, therefore, is the fulcrum of the great lever of progress, lifting\r\nhumanity from the material up to the spiritual realm. One short century\r\nago nearly all physical labor was performed by the hands of man. Since\r\nthen the mind has come up to the work, and rescued the body from the\r\nlaborious servitude of former times; and now a single mind, directing a\r\nsingle machine, produces an hundred-fold more than it could when acting\r\nthrough its own personal machine. The inventive powers of the mind will\r\ncontinue to produce more labor-saving machines until labor directly with\r\nthe hand will be almost, perhaps entirely, superseded.\r\n\r\nThe products of the mind, when compared with purely physical labor, are\r\nof inestimable value, and the great distinction everywhere recognized in\r\ntheir relative compensations is still too limited. No argument is needed\r\nto establish the dignity of labor; it has established itself in becoming\r\nthe architect of the great future, by building the past and the present.\r\n\r\nOut of the multiform phases of labor, questions will arise which will\r\nrequire for their adjustment equitable rules of compensation; the best\r\ntalent in the world can find ample scope for useful employment in the\r\nsolution of the numerous problems growing out of this vast subject.\r\n_Labor_—physical, mental and spiritual—finding itself in a position of\r\ninjustice, is in a state of constant irritation and discontent, and\r\nlegitimately seeks redress through the organization of associations to\r\ncontrol its price; but it is at least questionable whether such\r\ncombinations have been productive of any permanently beneficial results.\r\nIf it could be perceived and comprehended, there must be, in the nature\r\nof things, perfect and complete harmony in the practical operation of\r\nall the working elements or agencies, not only in this world, but in the\r\nboundless universe.\r\n\r\nThis problem may find a practical solution in co-operative labor\r\nassociations, in which the members share equally the profits upon what\r\nthey produce.\r\n\r\nSuppose the entire labor of the country were conducted upon this just\r\nprinciple, what would be the result? The rapidly accumulating wealth of\r\nthe country is the result of labor; if the united labor of the country,\r\nproducing this increase, should henceforward share it equally, the\r\nresult, in time, would be the _equalization_ of the wealth of the\r\ncountry, which is now rapidly growing into a necessity, to modify the\r\nluxurious habits of the rich on the one hand, and the crying evils of\r\npoverty on the other, which are rapidly engendering an antagonism, which\r\nwill continue to increase in volume and intensity until it will\r\nculminate in a storm that will consume the elements of discord in the\r\nsame manner (and upon the same immutable principles) by which African\r\nslavery was abolished in the Southern States of this Union.\r\n\r\nA careful investigation of the co-operative principle will show that it\r\nis not only possible, but perfectly simple and practicable, and that it\r\nis full of glorious prophecy to the vast numbers who are now “ground to\r\nthe earth” by the condition of actual slavery to the ordinary demands of\r\nnature which is entailed upon them from generation to generation,\r\nthrough the operations of false systems, which were founded upon and\r\nwhich are sustained by injustice and usurpation.\r\n\r\nWhile viewing this subject in its practical aspects, it must not be\r\nforgotten that _it_, too, is intimately connected with progress, and\r\nsubject to its decrees.\r\n\r\nIt is a well-established fact that the powers of endurance of the\r\nphysical system are growing less, generation after generation, while the\r\nmental power is increasing in about the same ratio; the legitimate\r\ndeduction from this fact is in perfect harmony with the general\r\nprogressive tendency of all things leading from the purely physical to\r\nthe spiritual, from which we may safely prophecy that the time will come\r\nwhen all labor will be performed by the mind, and when it shall have\r\nacquired perfect dominion over the material. The necessity for physical\r\nendurance will then have ended. The tendency to such a condition, though\r\nit has been, is, and may continue to be gradual, is nevertheless\r\npositive and well-defined.\r\n\r\nIntimately connected with the subject of labor, and the tendency to\r\nperform by the agency of inventions what still devolves upon the direct\r\napplication of physical strength, is that of supplying the demands of\r\nthe body. The food used now is very different from that of a hundred\r\nyears ago. Some who recognize this fact argue that the change of diet\r\nhas produced the change in the physical condition; but reasoning from\r\nanalogy, and applying the general rules of progress, leads to the\r\nconclusion that the changes in the relative conditions of the physical\r\nand mental, by which the latter asserts superior control, have rendered\r\na corresponding change of diet necessary; hence it is fair to conclude\r\nthat the change grows out of the necessities of the consumer, and is not\r\nthe producing cause in the premises; in other and general terms, the\r\nphysical system demands and should receive appropriate supplies.\r\n\r\nHundreds of people who once made use of the flesh of swine have entirely\r\ndiscarded it from their boards, instinctively feeling that it does not\r\nmeet their present demands, and there is a growing distaste for it.\r\nCommon observation shows that all kinds of flesh are gradually falling\r\ninto disfavor, especially among those who labor mentally or are devoted\r\nto spiritual things.\r\n\r\nAs the physical system is gradually being relieved of labor and the\r\nconsequent waste of its energies, the character of food it requires\r\nnecessarily changes, and in the place of physical strength to be\r\nsupplied is that upon which the brain can draw to replenish its wasting\r\nstock; the failure to recognize these demands causes very much of the\r\ndyspepsia from which those who lead sedentary lives suffer so generally;\r\nthese should discard those articles of diet that principally contribute\r\nto build up the material, and use such as will impart strength to the\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nThere are quite a number of well-authenticated cases of the actual\r\nsubsistence of the body upon the elements contained in the atmosphere a\r\nsufficient length of time to show that it could be continued\r\nindefinitely if the proper conditions were preserved. One of these cases\r\nin the State of Kentucky has remained seventeen years in this condition;\r\none in Chicago nearly four years; there is one in Brooklyn of three\r\nyears’ duration; and a number of others from ten to sixty days. In this\r\ncondition the physical system becomes entirely renovated, purified, and\r\nalmost transparent, and the spiritual faculties intensified many fold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n             TENDENCIES AND PROPHECIES OF THE PRESENT AGE.\r\n\r\n         [Revised from the American Workman of Nov. 20, 1870.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                NO. IV.\r\n\r\nArguing from the fact that the character of food subsisted upon is\r\ngradually changed from the purely physical to the more refined and rare,\r\nin connection with that of exceptional cases having existed, in which\r\nsupplies were drawn from entirely different sources than digested food,\r\nleads toward the conclusion, at least, that the time will come when men\r\nwill have grown out of the necessity of supplying the wasting energies\r\nof the body and mind by the use of food, and into that refined spiritual\r\ncondition in which he can draw directly upon the elements which the\r\natmosphere does or will furnish to supply all his demands. All the\r\narguments nature furnishes point to this condition. All know how very\r\nimportant it is to have a plentiful supply of pure air; but how far this\r\ngoes toward furnishing the elements of supply demanded by the body, the\r\ndeepest inquiries have not decided.\r\n\r\nIn a given case, the actual amount in weight that is furnished the body\r\ncan be determined; deducting the weight of the excretions and palpable\r\nsecretions, it is supposed the difference is consumed by some undefined\r\nprocess within the body; but who can tell how much and what the system\r\ntakes directly from the atmosphere, or how much it gives up to it, that\r\nwe have no means of defining by weight or otherwise? We also know that\r\nthe atmosphere maintains an immense pressure upon the body, and that it\r\ninvoluntarily resists this pressure; this could not happen were there\r\nnot some well defined and intimate relations between the two upon which\r\nman, as the object, must be greatly dependent.\r\n\r\nAnother strong and pointed argument is to be found in the process\r\nsometimes resorted to to sustain life: in cases of great prostration of\r\nthe physical system, under exhaustive disease, when the means cannot be\r\nsupplied through the medium of the stomach and digestion, they are\r\nfurnished by being absorbed into the system through the pores of the\r\nskin.\r\n\r\nThe constant death and decay of all the materials upon which we feed,\r\nbesides all that vast amount not drawn upon directly, is continually\r\ngiving off to the atmosphere the same kind of elements which the body\r\nretains and uses from supplies of food; as they exist in the atmosphere\r\nin the form of elements, and there is a demand within the body for them,\r\nit is only necessary to create and maintain the means of supply to solve\r\nthe problem. A glorious prophecy comes forth from the tendencies of\r\nlabor toward the mental, and the accompanying necessity for\r\nmodifications of diet, adapted to the many gradations man must pass\r\nthrough to reach a purely spiritual condition.\r\n\r\nThe physical system has been the accredited medium through which the\r\nspirit within it—the real man—has wrought, and still is, in all\r\nindividuals who are not beyond the point where _spirit_ becomes the\r\npredominant and governing characteristic. In the present, however, there\r\nare scattered here and there among the masses individuals who have\r\npassed—are passing—or are approaching that point in which the spirit, at\r\ntimes, acts independently of its material machine in which it has been\r\nfostered and cultured, and gives positive proofs of an existence within\r\nthe body of an individualized life, which can and does act without the\r\nagency of the body, and performs functions before impossible. There are\r\na thousand persons, at least, in this country who have a sight entirely\r\nindependent of the physical eye, which overleaps the boundaries of\r\nphysical vision; penetrates the barriers of external sense, tears off\r\nthe mask of hypocrisy and deceit, detects the motives and mainsprings of\r\naction, and lays bare the heart of man. While comparatively but few have\r\nattained this, all are approaching it. What does Paul mean but this when\r\nhe says, “Now we see, as through a glass, darkly; but then face to\r\nface”? When the spirit-eye shall have fully pierced its barriers of\r\nflesh, when the body shall have become subservient to the spirit,\r\ninstead of the spirit being dependent upon the body, when we “shall see\r\nas we are seen, and know as we are known,” how radical the changes, and\r\nhow rapid the strides of advancement will then be!\r\n\r\nReason for a moment upon the effect that would be produced were every\r\ntenth person suddenly endowed with spirit-sight, and compelled to\r\ndemonstrate it by exposing the hearts and the lives of all the rest.\r\nWhere could oppression hide itself? Where could the lusts of the flesh\r\nplot their treason against the sovereignty of the spirit, beyond the\r\nrange of _spirit vigilance_—this new safeguard of human society, the\r\neternal law of progress, which is now unfolding? In such a condition of\r\nthings, courts of justice, with all their attendant judges, bailiffs and\r\nattorneys-at-law, would find their occupation gone. Prisons would be\r\nconverted into asylums and workshops for the weak and unfortunate, and\r\ntheir keepers into superintendents and teachers. Churches would be\r\nconverted into lecture-rooms; and preachers, now hurling their anathemas\r\nagainst unrepentant sinners, would become professors of the great\r\nprinciples through and by which the world, and all things, have been\r\nbrought from the primary condition thus far on their march toward the\r\n_perfect_.\r\n\r\nMany individuals know that they are under the surveillance of this\r\nspirit-sight, and demonstrate in conduct its beneficent influence; but\r\nthe capacity has not yet become sufficiently general to compel the\r\nrecognition of its efficacy by the public mind. As the rising sun first\r\ngilds the mountain’s loftiest peak, next the hill-top, then glides along\r\nthe inviting slope to the universal plain, where all creation rejoices\r\nunder the refulgence of its noonday glories—so comes this _rising\r\nlight_, to illumine the hearts and souls of all when it shall have\r\nreached the zenith of its mid-day glory. As the beams reflected from the\r\nmountain top are of the sun, and not the mountains, so are these\r\nspiritual rays of the spiritual sun, and not of the individual\r\nreflecting them, or through whom they may chance to shine. Verily,\r\nverily, I say unto you, this people vaunteth and puffeth itself with\r\nknowledge, but wisdom hath surely departed to the lowly ones of earth!\r\nReligion, clad in its robes “of purple and fine linen,” faring\r\n“sumptuously every day,” forgetting that Christ was cradled in a manger,\r\nand that His disciples were fishermen, continually cries, as did the\r\n“Pharisees and hypocrites” of old: “Can any good thing come out of\r\nNazareth?”\r\n\r\nThe time is not far distant when the possession of spirit-sight will be\r\naccounted of the first importance, not to those only who possess it, but\r\nto the public generally, and will be sought for and made practical to\r\nthe honor of its possessors and to the inestimable benefit of all. The\r\ntime will come in the not far distant future when those who now cry out,\r\n“Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?” will bow, with becoming\r\nhumility, before the later-day _fishermen_; for these will then occupy\r\nthe places of public trust, and spirit-telegraphy, having superseded\r\nmaterial wires, will convey the commands of God’s accredited ministers\r\nfrom the central seat of Power throughout the world.\r\n\r\nWhere are all the great of the _past_; its orators, philosophers and\r\nstatesmen; Confucius, Zoroaster, Moses, David, Solomon, Lycurgus,\r\nDemosthenes, Cicero, Bonaparte, Washington, and many others, of all\r\nnations and climes, to whom history points as having stood hundreds of\r\nyears in advance of their times? Do they still live? and, living, are\r\nthey idle? Are their minds withdrawn from subjects to which they were\r\ndevoted in this primary school-house of the children of God? Are not\r\ntheir minds expanded to the comprehension of the great principles of\r\ngovernmental justice? Are they not better qualified to direct\r\nlegislation _now_ than the wisest among us? If they still live as\r\nspirits, if they have had better opportunities of obtaining wisdom and\r\nknowledge pertaining to earth-life than we—can this world avail itself\r\nof their assistance to establish on earth the government of heaven? If\r\nthe angel in the bush were possible, why may not angels manifest the\r\nwisdom, power, and justice of God in our legislative halls? Who will\r\ndare to assert that they are not even now seeking another Moses to lead\r\n“His people” up out of Egypt? Then will the prophecies of the present\r\nhave reached consummation; then will commence the earthly reign of the\r\nKing of kings and Lord of lords, as prophesied by all the holy prophets\r\nof the world; then old things shall pass away and all things become new;\r\nthen _the Christ_ shall sit upon the throne, and from his inexhausted\r\nfountain of love, justice shall continually flow over all the earth, “as\r\nthe waters cover the sea.”\r\n\r\nAs vanish the heavy mists of the morning before the radiance of the\r\nrising sun, so will vanish the clouds that hang around the minds of man,\r\nand shut out the rising spiritual sun, for whose “star in the East”\r\n_wise men_ are continually watching; the sun that will rise higher and\r\nhigher, and extend its rays wider and wider, until it shall enlighten\r\nthe minds of all mankind, until the icebergs of ignorance, tradition and\r\nsuperstition are dissolved which now float in the ocean of\r\nprogress—society, with its cankered, festering heart; commerce robbed of\r\nits legitimate function; labor of its recompense, and religion of its\r\nspirituality; education lacking wisdom, marriages forming “disunions,”\r\nand women without rights.\r\n\r\nAll the false forms of the present must yield their sway to God’s\r\ncommand—“Let there be light.” The laws of God are never changed—though\r\nold as creation—they are ever new, ever sufficient for all the\r\nvicissitudes of life; they are ever full of wisdom, justice and love;\r\nthey are written all over the face of creation, in the bosom of the\r\nearth and in the heart of man; they are uttered by the raging tempest\r\nthat rocks the mighty ocean; in the terrible mutterings of the\r\nearthquake; in the fury of destructive battle, when hosts are hurled on\r\nhosts in fraternal strife; through all these the voice of God\r\nproclaims—“Let there be light,” and there is light.\r\n\r\nWe also hear its whispers in the gentle zephyrs that stir the bursting\r\nbuds and in the blooming flowers that lift their heads to drink the\r\nfalling dew; in the hum of busy nature; in the gushing fountain; we see\r\nit in the gambols of the bubbling brook; in the mother’s love for the\r\nnew-born life; in the father’s pride; in the unspoken joy of the\r\nmaiden’s soul, listening to the first sweet tones of love; in the\r\nmagnetic ties of human sympathy which bind all mankind in a common\r\nbrotherhood, and in the dawning light of heaven brought to earth by the\r\nangelic hosts to usher in the reign of universal justice, peace and\r\nlove.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES\r\n\r\n 1.
