DAVIS, Clerk of the District of Massachusetts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PUBLIC.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the last twenty years, our political opinions have partaken\r\nso much of feeling, in the contest between the two great European\r\nrivals, that the happiness, the interests, and even the character\r\nof America seem to have been almost forgotten. But the spirit of\r\nparty has now most happily so far subsided, that a disposition to\r\nlook into, and examine the history of our own dear country, and its\r\nconcerns, very generally prevails. Perhaps there is no part of that\r\nhistory, that is more interesting, than the controversy between Great\r\nBritain and her colonies, which produced the war of the revolution,\r\nand their final separation.\r\n\r\nIt is important, that the rising generation should be well acquainted\r\nwith the principles and justice of that cause, which eventuated in\r\nour Independence, and to which we are indebted for our present envied\r\nstate of prosperity and happiness.\r\n\r\nThe principles of that controversy were ably discussed by various\r\nwriters, both in England and America; but it has been supposed,\r\nthat the sentiments and conduct of each party were more elaborately\r\ndisplayed, in certain essays published in Boston, a short time\r\nprevious to the commencement of hostilities, over the signatures of\r\n_Novanglus_ and _Massachusettensis_, than in any other productions\r\nwhatever.\r\n\r\nThe former were written by JOHN ADAMS, then a distinguished\r\ncitizen of Boston, one of the noblest assertors of the rights and\r\nprivileges of the colonies, and who has since been elected to the\r\nmost important and honourable offices in the gift of the nation.\r\n\r\nThe latter were written by JONATHAN SEWALL, then king's\r\nAttorney General of the province of Massachusetts; a gentleman of\r\neducation and talents--the champion--and possessing the confidence of\r\nwhat were then called the government party.\r\n\r\nBy an attentive perusal of these essays, a correct judgment may be\r\nformed of all the principal and leading points of the controversy,\r\nbetween the colonies and the mother country.\r\n\r\nConfiding in the correctness of these sentiments, and the patronage\r\nof an enlightened public, we have re-published the above mentioned\r\nessays; to which are added, all those interesting letters, written\r\nby President ADAMS, and addressed to the Hon. WILLIAM TUDOR, lately\r\nprinted in the Boston Daily Advertiser, together with others never\r\nbefore published.\r\n\r\nThe venerable and patriotic author of _Novanglus_, now lives to\r\nbehold and enjoy the blessed fruits of his labours, and that of his\r\ncompatriots, and possesses, in the highest degree, the intellect of\r\nhis most intellectual days.\r\n\r\nIn offering this volume to the public, we please ourselves with\r\nthe hope, that it will be a valuable acquisition to all classes of\r\ncitizens, who wish to become acquainted with those principles of\r\ncivil liberty, for which our ancestors so nobly, and so successfully\r\ncontended. To the gentlemen of the bar, to legislators, and to\r\npoliticians generally, we conceive it will be an inestimable treasure.\r\n\r\nWe are forcibly impressed with the wonderful effect the essays\r\nof Novanglus must have produced, in the times in which they were\r\npublished, by convincing the great body of the people, that the\r\n_parliament_ of Great Britain had no right to tax the colonies in\r\nAmerica. But in reflecting on the CONSEQUENCES of that glorious\r\nrevolution which these essays greatly tended to produce, the mind\r\nis imperatively drawn to a contemplation of the present political\r\ncondition of Europe. Representative governments are gradually\r\nintroducing themselves into every part of that country; and we hope\r\nthe day is not far distant, when the whole world shall be emancipated\r\nfrom tyranny. As AMERICANS we feel a _conscious_ pride, that the\r\nresistance which our ancestors made to the arbitrary machinations of\r\nan Hutchinson, a Bute, a Mansfield and a North, will terminate in the\r\ncivil and political freedom of ALL MANKIND.\r\n\r\nHEWS & GOSS.\r\n\r\nBOSTON, JULY 1, 1819.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_ERRATA._\r\n\r\n\r\n  PAGE.

But, as I am no\r\ngenealogist, I must refer to my aged classmate and highly esteemed\r\nfriend Judge Sewall of York, whose researches will, one day, explain\r\nthe whole.\r\n\r\nMr. SEWALL's father was unfortunate; died young, leaving his\r\nson destitute; but as the child had discovered a pregnant genius, he\r\nwas educated by the charitable contribution of his friends, of whom\r\nDr. Samuel Cooper was one of the most active and successful, among\r\nhis opulent parishoners. Mr. SEWALL graduated at college\r\nin 1748; kept a Latin school in Salem, till 1756, when Chambers\r\nRussell, of Lincoln, a Judge of the Supreme Court and a Judge of\r\nAdmiralty, from a principle of disinterested benevolence, received\r\nhim into his family; instructed him in law; furnished him with books\r\nand introduced him to the practise at the bar. In 1757 and 1758,\r\nhe attended the Supreme Court in Worcester, and spent his evenings\r\nwith me in the office of Colonel James Putnam, a gentleman of great\r\nacuteness of mind, and very extensive and successful in practise, and\r\nan able lawyer; in whose family I boarded and under whose auspices\r\nI studied law. Here commenced between Mr. SEWALL and me,\r\na personal friendship, which continued, with none but political\r\ninterruptions, till his death. He commenced practice in Charlestown,\r\nin the County of Middlesex, I, in that parish of the ancient town of\r\nBraintree, now called Quincy, then in the County of Suffolk, now of\r\nNorfolk. We attended the Courts in Boston, Cambridge, Charlestown,\r\nand Concord; lived together, frequently slept in the same chamber,\r\nand not seldom, in the same bed. Mr. SEWALL was then a patriot;\r\nhis sentiments were purely American. To James Otis, who took a\r\nkind notice of us both, we constantly applied for advice in any\r\ndifficulty, and he would attend to us, advise us, and look into books\r\nfor us, and point out authorities to us, as kindly as if we had been\r\nhis pupils or his sons.\r\n\r\nAfter the surrender of Montreal in 1759, rumours were every where\r\nspread that the English would now new model the Colonies, demolish\r\nthe charters and reduce all to royal governments. These rumours I had\r\nheard as often as he had. One morning I met him, accidentally, on the\r\nfloor of the old Town House. \"John\" said he, \"I want to speak with\r\nyou;\" he always called me John, and I him Jonathan, and often said to\r\nhim, I wish my name were David. He took me to a window seat and said;\r\n\"these Englishmen are going to play the devil with us. They will\r\noverturn every thing. We must resist them and that by force. I wish\r\nyou would write in the Newspapers, and urge a general attention to\r\nthe Militia, to their exercises and discipline, for we must resist in\r\narms.\" I answered, \"All this I fear is true; but why do you not write\r\nyourself? You are older than I am; have more experience than I have,\r\nare more intimate with the grandees than I am, and you can write ten\r\ntimes better than I can.\" There had been a correspondence between\r\nus, by which I knew his refined style as well as he knew my coarse\r\none. \"Why,\" said Mr. SEWALL, \"I would write, but Goffe will\r\nfind me out and I shall grieve his righteous soul, and you know\r\nwhat influence he has in Middlesex.\" This Goffe had been Attorney\r\nGeneral for twenty years, and commanded the practise in Middlesex and\r\nWorcester and several other Counties. He had power to crush, by his\r\nfrown or his nod any young Lawyer in his County. He was afterwards\r\nJudge Trowbridge, but at that time as ardent as any of Hutchinson's\r\ndisciples, though he afterwards became alienated from his pursuits\r\nand principles.\r\n\r\nIn December 1760, or January 1761, Stephen Sewall, Chief Justice\r\ndied, deeply lamented, though insolvent. My friend JONATHAN,\r\nhis nephew, the son of his brother, who tenderly loved and deeply\r\nrevered his uncle, could not bear the thought, that the memory of\r\nthe Chief Justice should lie under the imputation of bankruptcy. At\r\nthat time bankruptcy was infamous; now it is scarcely disgraceful.\r\nJONATHAN undertook the administration of his uncle's estate.\r\nFinding insolvency inevitable, he drew a petition to the General\r\nCourt to grant a sum of money, sufficient, to pay the Chief Justice's\r\ndebts. If my friend had known the character of his countrymen, or\r\nthe nature of that Assembly, he never would have conceived such a\r\nproject; but he did conceive it and applied to James Otis, and his\r\nfather, Colonel Otis, to patronize and support it. The Otis's knew\r\ntheir countrymen better than he did. They received and presented\r\nthe petition, but without much hope of success. The petition was\r\nrejected, and my friend SEWALL conceived a suspicion, that\r\nit was not promoted with so much zeal, by the Otis's, as he thought\r\nthey might have exerted. He imputed the failure to their coldness;\r\nwas much mortified and conceived a violent resentment, which he\r\nexpressed with too much freedom and feeling in all companies.\r\n\r\nGoffe, Hutchinson and all the courtiers soon heard of it and\r\ninstantly fastened their eyes upon SEWALL; courted his society;\r\nsounded his fame; promoted his practise, and soon after made him\r\nSolicitor General by creating a new office, expressly for him. Mr.\r\nSEWALL, had a soft, smooth, insinuating eloquence, which gliding\r\nimperceptibly into the minds of a Jury, gave him as much power over\r\nthat tribunal as any lawyer ought ever to possess. He was also\r\ncapable of discussing before the court, any intricate question\r\nof law, which gave him, at least, as much influence there as was\r\nconsistent with an impartial administration of justice. He was a\r\ngentleman and a scholar; had a fund of wit, humour and satire,\r\nwhich he used with great discretion at the bar, but poured out\r\nwith unbounded profusion in the newspapers. Witness his voluminous\r\nproductions in the newspapers, signed _long J._ and _Philanthropos_.\r\nThese accomplishments richly qualified him to serve the purposes of\r\nthe gentlemen, who courted him into their service.\r\n\r\nMr. SEWALL soon fell in love with Miss Esther Quincy, the\r\nfourth daughter of Edmund Quincy, Esq. an eminent merchant and\r\nmagistrate, and a grand daughter of that Edmund Quincy, who was\r\neighteen years a Judge of the Superior Court, who died of the small\r\npox in the agency of the province at the Court of St. James's,\r\nand whose monument was erected, at the expense of the Province,\r\nin Bun-hill-fields, London. This young lady, who was celebrated\r\nfor her beauty, her vivacity and spirit, lived with her father in\r\nthis parish, now called Quincy. Mr. SEWALL's courtship was extended\r\nfor several years, and he came up very constantly on Saturdays and\r\nremained here until Mondays; and I was sure to be invited to meet him\r\non every Sunday evening. During all these years, there was a constant\r\ncorrespondence between us, and he concealed nothing from me, so that\r\nI knew him by his style whenever he appeared in print.\r\n\r\nIn 1766, he married the object of his affections, and an excellent\r\nwife he found her. He was soon appointed Attorney General. In 1768,\r\nhe was employed by Governor Barnard to offer me the office of\r\nAdvocate General, in the Court of Admiralty, which I decidedly and\r\nperemptorily though respectfully refused.\r\n\r\nWe continued our friendship and confidential intercourse, though\r\nprofessedly in boxes of politics, as opposite as East and West,\r\nuntil the year 1774, when we both attended the Superior Court in\r\nFalmouth, Casco-bay, now Portland. I had then been chosen a delegate\r\nto Congress. Mr. SEWALL invited me to take a walk with him, very\r\nearly in the morning, on the great hill. In the course of our rambles\r\nhe very soon begun to remonstrate against my going to Congress. He\r\nsaid \"that Great Britain was determined on her system; her power was\r\nirresistible and would certainly be destructive to me, and to all\r\nthose who should persevere in opposition to her designs.\" I answered,\r\n\"that I knew Great Britain was determined on her system, and that\r\nvery determination, determined me on mine; that he knew I had been\r\nconstant and uniform in opposition to all her measures; that the die\r\nwas now cast; I had passed the Rubicon; swim or sink, live or die,\r\nsurvive or perish with my country, was my unalterable determination.\"\r\nThe conversation was protracted into length, but this was the\r\nsubstance of the whole. It terminated in my saying to him, \"I see we\r\nmust part, and with a bleeding heart I say, I fear forever; but you\r\nmay depend upon it, this adieu is the sharpest thorn on which I ever\r\nsat my foot.\" I never conversed with him again 'till the year 1788.\r\nMr. SEWALL retired in 1775 to England, where he remained and resided\r\nin Bristol.\r\n\r\nOn my return from Congress in the month of November 1774, I found\r\nthe Massachusetts Gazette teeming with political speculations, and\r\nMassachusettensis shining like the moon among the lesser stars.\r\nI instantly knew him to be my friend SEWALL, and was told he excited\r\ngreat exultation among the tories and many gloomy apprehensions among\r\nthe whigs. I instantly resolved to enter the lists with him, and this\r\nis the history of the following volume.\r\n\r\nIn 1788, Mr. SEWALL came to London to embark for Halifax. I\r\nenquired for his lodgings and instantly drove to them, laying aside\r\nall etiquette, to make him a visit. I ordered my servant to announce\r\nJohn Adams, was instantly admitted, and both of us forgetting that we\r\nhad ever been enemies, embraced each other as cordially as ever. I\r\nhad two hours conversation with him in a most delightful freedom upon\r\na multitude of subjects. He told me he had lived for the sake of his\r\ntwo children; he had spared no pains nor expense in their education,\r\nand he was going to Halifax in hope of making some provision for\r\nthem. They are now two of the most respectable gentlemen in Canada.\r\nOne of them a Chief Justice; the other an Attorney General. Their\r\nfather lived but a short time after his return to America; evidently\r\nbroken down by his anxieties and probably dying of a broken heart. He\r\nalways lamented the conduct of Great Britain towards America. No man\r\nmore constantly congratulated me, while we lived together in America,\r\nupon any news, true or false, favorable to a repeal of the obnoxious\r\nStatutes and a redress of our grievances; but the society in which he\r\nlived had convinced him that all resistance was not only useless but\r\nruinous.\r\n\r\nMore conscious than ever of the faults in the style and arrangement,\r\nif not in the matter of my part of the following papers, I shall see\r\nthem in print with more anxiety than when they were first published.\r\nThe principles however are those on which I then conscientiously\r\nacted, and which I now most cordially approve.\r\n\r\nTo the candour of an indulgent nation, whom I congratulate on their\r\npresent prosperity and pleasing prospects, and for whose happiness I\r\nshall offer up my dying supplications to Heaven, I commit the volume\r\nwith all its imperfections.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n_Quincy_, _January_ 1, 1819.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESSED\r\n\r\n_To the Inhabitants of the Colony of Massachusetts Bay_,\r\n\r\nJanuary 23, 1775.\r\n\r\n\r\nMY FRIENDS,\r\n\r\nA writer, under the signature of Massachusettensis, has addressed\r\nyou, in a series of papers, on the great national subject of the\r\npresent quarrel between the British administration and the Colonies.\r\nAs I have not in my possession, more than one of his Essays, and that\r\nis in the Gazette of December 26, I will take the liberty, in the\r\nspirit of candor, and decency, to bespeak your attention, upon the\r\nsame subject.\r\n\r\nThere may be occasion, to say very severe things, before I shall have\r\nfinished what I propose, in opposition to this writer but there ought\r\nto be no reviling. _Rem ipsam dic, mitte male loqui_, which may be\r\njustly translated, speak out the whole truth boldly, but use no bad\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\nIt is not very material to enquire, as others have done, who is the\r\nauthor of the speculations in question. If he is a disinterested\r\nwriter, and has nothing to gain or to lose, to hope or to fear, for\r\nhimself more than other individuals of your community; but engages\r\nin this controversy from the purest principles, the noblest motives\r\nof benevolence to men, and of love to his country, he ought to have\r\nno influence with you, further than truth and justice will support\r\nhis argument. On the other hand, if he hopes to acquire or preserve\r\na lucrative employment, to screen himself from the just detestation\r\nof his countrymen, or whatever other sinister inducement he may have,\r\nas far as the truth of facts and the weight of argument, are in his\r\nfavor, he ought to be duly regarded.\r\n\r\nHe tells you \"that the temporal salvation of this province depends\r\nupon an entire and speedy change of measures, which must depend upon\r\na change of sentiments respecting our own conduct and the justice of\r\nthe British nation.\"\r\n\r\nThe task, of effecting these great changes, this courageous writer,\r\nhas undertaken in a course of publications in a newspaper. _Nil\r\ndesperandum_ is a good motto, and _Nil admirari_, is another. He is\r\nwelcome to the first, and I hope will be willing that I should assume\r\nthe last. The public, if they are not mistaken in their conjecture,\r\nhave been so long acquainted with this gentleman, and have seen him\r\nso often disappointed, that if they were not habituated to strange\r\nthings, they would wonder at his hopes, at this time to accomplish,\r\nthe most unpromising project of his whole life. In the character\r\nof Philanthrop, he attempted to reconcile you to Mr. Bernard. But\r\nthe only fruit of his labor was, to expose his client to more\r\ngeneral examination, and consequently to more general resentment\r\nand aversion. In the character of Philalethes, he essayed to prove\r\nMr. Hutchinson a patriot, and his letters not only innocent, but\r\nmeritorious. But the more you read and considered, the more you\r\nwere convinced of the ambition and avarice, the simulation and\r\ndissimulation, the hypocricy and perfidy of that destroying angel.\r\n\r\nThis illfated and unsuccessful, though persevering writer, still\r\nhopes to change your sentiments and conduct--by which it is\r\nsupposed that he means to convince you that the system of Colony\r\nadministration, which has been pursued for these ten or twelve\r\nyears past, is a wise, righteous and humane plan; that sir Francis\r\nBernard and Mr. Hutchinson, with their connections, who have been the\r\nprincipal instruments of it, are your best friends;--and that those\r\ngentle in this province, and in all the other Colonies, who have been\r\nin opposition to it, are from ignorance, error, or from worse and\r\nbaser causes, your worst enemies.\r\n\r\nThis is certainly an inquiry that is worthy of you; and I promise to\r\naccompany this writer, in his ingenious labours to assist you in it.\r\nAnd I earnestly intreat you, as the result of all shall be, to change\r\nyour sentiments or persevere in them, as the evidence shall appear to\r\nyou, upon the most dispassionate and impartial consideration, without\r\nregard to his opinion or mine.\r\n\r\nHe promises to avoid personal reflections, but to penetrate the\r\narcana, and expose the wretched policy of the whigs. The cause of\r\nthe whigs is not conducted by intrigues at a distant court, but\r\nby constant appeals to a sensible and virtuous people; it depends\r\nintirely on their good will, and cannot be pursued a single step\r\nwithout their concurrence, to obtain which of all designs, measures,\r\nand means, are constantly published to the collective body. The\r\nwhigs therefore can have no arcana; but if they had, I dare say they\r\nwere never so left, as to communicate them to this writer; you will\r\ntherefore be disappointed if you expect from him any thing which is\r\ntrue, but what has been as public as records and newspapers could\r\nmake it.\r\n\r\nI, on my part, may perhaps in a course of papers, penetrate arcana\r\ntoo. Shew the wicked policy of the tories--trace their plan from its\r\nfirst rude sketches to its present complete draught. Shew that it\r\nhas been much longer in contemplation, than is generally known,--who\r\nwere the first in it--their views, motives and secret springs of\r\naction--and the means they have employed. This will necessarily\r\nbring before your eyes many characters, living and dead. From such\r\na research and detail of facts, it will clearly appear, who were\r\nthe aggressors--and who have acted on the defensive from first to\r\nlast--who are still struggling, at the expense of their ease,\r\nhealth, peace, wealth and preferment, against the encroachments of\r\nthe tories on their country--and who are determined to continue\r\nstruggling, at much greater hazards still, and like the Prince of\r\nOrange, resolve never to see its entire subjection to arbitrary\r\npower, but rather to die fighting against it, in the last ditch.\r\n\r\nIt is true, as this writer observes, \"that the bulk of the people\r\nare generally, but little versed in the affairs of State; that they\r\nleft the affairs of government where accident has placed them.\" If\r\nthis had not been true, the designs of the tories had been many years\r\nago, entirely defeated. It was clearly seen, by a few, more than ten\r\nyears since, that they were planning and pursuing the very measures,\r\nwe now see executing. The people were informed of it, and warned of\r\ntheir danger: But they had been accustomed to confide in certain\r\npersons, and could never be persuaded to believe, until prophecy,\r\nbecame history. Now they see and feel, that the horrible calamities\r\nare come upon them, which were foretold so many years ago, and they\r\nnow sufficiently execrate the men who have brought these things upon\r\nthem. Now alas! when perhaps it is too late. If they had withdrawn\r\ntheir confidence from them in season, they would have wholly disarmed\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe same game, with the same success, has been played in all ages\r\nand countries as Massachusettensis observes. When a favourable\r\nconjuncture has presented, some of the most intrigueing and powerful\r\ncitizens have conceived the design of enslaving their country, and\r\nbuilding their own greatness on its ruins. Philip and Alexander,\r\nare examples of this in Greece--Cæsar in Rome--Charles the fifth in\r\nSpain--Lewis the eleventh in France--and ten thousand others.\r\n\r\n\"There is a latent spark in the breasts of the people capable of\r\nbeing kindled into a flame, and to do this has always been the\r\nemployment of the disaffected.\" What is this latent spark? The love\r\nof Liberty? _a Deo hominis est indita naturæ._ Human nature itself is\r\nevermore an advocate for liberty. There is also in human nature, a\r\nresentment of injury, and indignation against wrong. A love of truth\r\nand a veneration for virtue.\r\n\r\nThese amiable passions, are the \"latent spark\" to which those whom\r\nthis writer calls the \"disaffected\" apply. If the people are capable\r\nof understanding, seeing and feeling the difference between true and\r\nfalse, right and wrong, virtue and vice, to what better principle can\r\nthe friends of mankind apply, than to the sense of this difference.\r\n\r\nIs it better to apply as this writer and his friends do, to the\r\nbasest passions in the human breast to their fear, their vanity,\r\ntheir avarice, ambition, and every kind of corruption? I appeal to\r\nall experience, and to universal history, if it has ever been in\r\nthe power of popular leaders, uninvested with other authority than\r\nwhat is conferred by the popular suffrage, to persuade a large\r\npeople, for any length of time together, to think themselves wronged,\r\ninjured, and oppressed, unless they really were, and saw and felt it\r\nto be so.\r\n\r\n\"They,\" the popular leaders, \"begin by reminding the people of the\r\nelevated rank they hold in the universe as men; that all men by\r\nnature are equal; that kings are but the ministers of the people;\r\nthat their authority is delegated to them by the people, for their\r\ngood, and they have a right to resume it, and place it in other\r\nhands, or keep it themselves, whenever it is made use of to oppress\r\nthem. Doubtless there have been instances, when these principles have\r\nbeen inculcated to obtain a redress of real grievances, but they have\r\nbeen much oftener perverted to the worst of purposes.\"\r\n\r\nThese are what are called revolution principles. They are the\r\nprinciples of Aristotle and Plato, of Livy and Cicero, and Sydney,\r\nHarrington and Locke. The principles of nature and eternal reason.\r\nThe principles on which the whole government over us, now stands.\r\nIt is therefore astonishing, if any thing can be so, that writers,\r\nwho call themselves friends of government, should in this age and\r\ncountry, be so inconsistent with themselves, so indiscreet, so\r\nimmodest, as to insinuate a doubt concerning them.\r\n\r\nYet we find that these principles stand in the way of\r\nMassachusettensis, and all the writers of his class. The veteran, in\r\nhis letter to the officers of the army, allows them to be noble, and\r\ntrue, but says the application of them to particular cases is wild\r\nand utopian. How they can be in general true, and not applicable to\r\nparticular cases, I cannot comprehend. I thought their being true in\r\ngeneral, was because they were applicable in most particular cases.\r\n\r\nGravity is a principle in nature. Why? because all particular bodies\r\nare found to gravitate. How would it sound to say, that bodies in\r\ngeneral are heavy; yet to apply this to particular bodies and say,\r\nthat a guinea, or a ball is heavy, is wild, &c.--\"Adopted in private\r\nlife,\" says the honest amiable veteran, \"they would introduce\r\nperpetual discord.\" This I deny, and I think it plain, that there\r\nnever was an happy private family where they were not adopted. \"In\r\nthe State perpetual discord.\" This I deny, and affirm that order,\r\nconcord and stability in this State, never was or can be preserved\r\nwithout them. \"The least failure in the reciprocal duties of worship\r\nand obedience in the matrimonial contract would justify a divorce.\"\r\nThis is no consequence from those principles,--a total departure from\r\nthe ends and designs of the contract it is true, as elopement and\r\nadultery, would by these principles justify a divorce, but not the\r\nleast failure, or many smaller failures in the reciprocal duties,\r\n&c. \"In the political compact, the smallest defect in the Prince a\r\nrevolution\"--By no means. But a manifest design in the Prince, to\r\nannul the contract on his part, will annul it on the part of the\r\npeople. A settled plan to deprive the people of all the benefits,\r\nblessings and ends of the contract, to subvert the fundamentals\r\nof the constitution, to deprive them of all share in making and\r\nexecuting laws, will justify a revolution.\r\n\r\nThe author of a \"Friendly Address to all reasonable Americans,\"\r\ndiscovers his rancour against these principles, in a more explicit\r\nmanner, and makes no scruples to advance the principles of Hobbs and\r\nFilmer, boldly, and to pronounce damnation, _ore rotundo_, on all\r\nwho do not practice implicit passive obedience, to an established\r\ngovernment, of whatever character it may be. It is not reviling, it\r\nis not bad language, it is strictly decent to say, that this angry\r\nbigot, this ignorant dogmatist, this foul mouthed scold, deserves no\r\nother answer than silent contempt. Massachusettensis and the veteran,\r\nI admire, the first for his art, the last for his honesty.\r\n\r\nMassachusettensis, is more discreet than either of the others;\r\nsensible that these principles would be very troublesome to him, yet\r\nconscious of their truth, he has neither admitted nor denied them.\r\nBut we have a right to his opinion of them, before we dispute with\r\nhim. He finds fault with the application of them. They have been\r\ninvariably applied in support of the revolution and the present\r\nestablishment--against the Stuart's, the Charles' and the James',--in\r\nsupport of the reformation and the Protestant religion, against the\r\nworst tyranny, that the genius of toryism, has ever yet invented, I\r\nmean the Roman superstition. Does this writer rank the revolution and\r\npresent establishment, the reformation and Protestant religion among\r\nhis worst of purposes? What \"worse purpose\" is there than established\r\ntyranny? Were these principles ever inculcated in favor of such\r\ntyranny? Have they not always been used against such tyrannies,\r\nwhen the people have had knowledge enough to be apprized of them,\r\nand courage to assert them? Do not those who aim at depriving the\r\npeople of their liberties, always inculcate opposite principles, or\r\ndiscredit these.\r\n\r\n\"A small mistake in point of policy,\" says he, \"often furnishes\r\na pretence to libel government and persuade the people that\r\ntheir rulers are tyrants, and the whole government, a system of\r\noppression.\" This is not only untrue, but inconsistent with what he\r\nsaid before. The people are in their nature so gentle, that there\r\nnever was a government yet, in which thousands of mistakes were\r\nnot overlooked. The most sensible and jealous people are so little\r\nattentive to government, that there are no instances of resistance,\r\nuntil repeated, multiplied oppressions have placed it beyond a doubt,\r\nthat their rulers had formed settled plans to deprive them of their\r\nliberties; not to oppress an individual or a few, but to break down\r\nthe fences of a free constitution, and deprive the people at large\r\nof all share in the government and all the checks by which it is\r\nlimited. Even Machiavel himself allows, that not ingratitude to their\r\nrulers, but much love is the constant fault of the people.\r\n\r\nThis writer is equally mistaken, when he says, the people are sure to\r\nbe loosers in the end. They can hardly be loosers, if unsuccessful;\r\nbecause if they live, they can but be slaves, after an unfortunate\r\neffort, and slaves they would have been, if they had not resisted.\r\nSo that nothing is lost. If they die, they cannot be said to lose,\r\nfor death is better than slavery. If they succeed, their gains are\r\nimmense. They preserve their liberties. The instances in antiquity,\r\nwhich this writer alludes to, are not mentioned, and therefore\r\ncannot be answered, but that in the country from whence we are\r\nderived, is the most unfortunate for his purpose, that could have\r\nbeen chosen. The resistance to Charles the First and the case of\r\nCromwell, no doubt he means. But the people of England, and the cause\r\nof liberty, truth, virtue and humanity, gained infinite advantages\r\nby that resistance. In all human probability, liberty civil and\r\nreligious, not only in England but in all Europe, would have been\r\nlost. Charles would undoubtedly have established the Romish religion\r\nand a despotism as wild as any in the world. And as England has\r\nbeen a principal bulwark from that period to this, of civil liberty\r\nand the Protestant religion in all Europe, if Charles' schemes had\r\nsucceeded, there is great reason to apprehend that the right of\r\nscience would have been extinguished, and mankind, drawn back to a\r\nstate of darkness and misery, like that which prevailed from the\r\nfourth to the fourteenth century. It is true and to be lamented that\r\nCromwell did not establish a government as free, as he might and\r\nought; but his government was infinitely more glorious and happy to\r\nthe people than Charles'. Did not the people gain by the resistance\r\nto James the second? Did not the Romans gain by the resistance to\r\nTarquin? Throughout that resistance and the liberty that was restored\r\nby it, would the great Roman orators, poets and historians, the great\r\nteachers of humanity and politeness, the pride of human nature, and\r\nthe delight and glory of mankind, for seventeen hundred years, ever\r\nhave existed? Did not the Romans gain by resistance to the Decemvirs?\r\nDid not the English gain by resistance to John, when Magna Charta was\r\nobtained? Did not the seven united provinces gain by resistance to\r\nPhilip, Alva, and Granvell? Did not the Swiss Cantons, the Genevans\r\nand Grissons, gain by resistance to Albert and Grisler?\r\n\r\nNOVANGLUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESSED\r\n\r\n_To the Inhabitants of the Colony of Massachusetts Bay_,\r\n\r\nJanuary 30, 1775.\r\n\r\n\r\nMY FRIENDS,\r\n\r\nI have heretofore intimated my intention, of pursuing the tories,\r\nthrough all their dark intrigues, and wicked machinations; and to\r\nshew the rise, and progress of their schemes for enslaving this\r\ncountry. The honor of inventing and contriving these measures, is\r\nnot their due. They have been but servile copiers of the designs of\r\nAndross, Randolph, Dudley, and other champions of their cause towards\r\nthe close of the last century. These latter worthies accomplished\r\nbut little; and their plans had been buried with them, for a long\r\ncourse of years, until in the administration of the late Governor\r\nShirley, they were revived, by the persons who are now principally\r\nconcerned in carrying them into execution. Shirley, was a crafty,\r\nbusy, ambitious, intrigueing, enterprising man; and having mounted,\r\nno matter by what means, to the chair of this province, he saw, in a\r\nyoung growing country, vast prospects of ambition opening before his\r\neyes, and he conceived great designs of aggrandizing himself, his\r\nfamily and his friends. Mr. Hutchinson and Mr. Oliver, the two famous\r\nletter writers, were his principal ministers of State. Russell,\r\nPaxton, Ruggles, and a few others, were _subordinate_ instruments.\r\nAmong other schemes of this Junto, one was to have a Revenue in\r\nAmerica by authority of Parliament.\r\n\r\nIn order to effect their purpose it was necessary to concert measures\r\nwith the other Colonies. Dr. Franklin, who was known to be an active,\r\nand very able man, and to have great influence, in the province\r\nof Pennsylvania, was in Boston, in the year 1754, and Mr. Shirley\r\ncommunicated to him the profound secret, the great design of taxing\r\nthe Colonies by act of Parliament. This sagacious gentleman, this\r\neminent philosopher, and distinguished patriot, to his lasting honor,\r\nsent the Governor an answer in writing with the following remarks\r\nupon his scheme. Remarks which would have discouraged any honest man\r\nfrom the pursuit. The remarks are these:--\r\n\r\n\"That the people always bear the burden best, when they have, or\r\nthink they have, some _share_ in the direction.\r\n\r\n\"That when public measures are generally distasteful to the people,\r\nthe wheels of government must move more heavily.\r\n\r\n\"That excluding the people of America from all share in the choice of\r\na grand council for their own defence, and taxing them in Parliament,\r\nwhere they have no representative, would probably give extreme\r\ndissatisfaction.\r\n\r\n\"That there was no reason to doubt the willingness of the Colonists\r\nto contribute for their own defence. That the people themselves,\r\nwhose all was at stake, could better judge of the force necessary for\r\ntheir defence, and of the means for raising money for the purpose,\r\nthan a British Parliament at so great distance.\r\n\r\n\"That natives of America, would be as likely to consult wisely and\r\nfaithfully for the safety of their native country, as the Governors\r\nsent from Britain, whose object is generally to make fortunes, and\r\nthen return home, and who might therefore be expected to carry on the\r\nwar against France, rather in a way, by which themselves were likely\r\nto be gainers, than for the greatest advantage of the cause.\r\n\r\n\"That compelling the Colonies to pay money for their own defence,\r\nwithout their consent, would shew a suspicion of their loyalty, or of\r\ntheir regard for their country, or of their common sense, and would\r\nbe treating them as conquered enemies, and not as free Britains,\r\nwho hold it for their undoubted right not to be taxed by their own\r\nconsent, given through their representatives.\r\n\r\n\"That parliamentary taxes, once laid on, are often continued, after\r\nthe necessity for laying them on, ceases; but that if the Colonists\r\nwere trusted to tax themselves, they would remove the burden from the\r\npeople, as soon as it should become unnecessary for them to bear it\r\nany longer.\r\n\r\n\"That if Parliament is to tax the Colonies, their assemblies of\r\nrepresentatives may be dismissed as useless.\r\n\r\n\"That taxing the Colonies in Parliament for their own defence against\r\nthe French, is not more just, than it would be to oblige the cinque\r\nports, and other parts of Britain, to maintain a force against\r\nFrance, and to tax them for this purpose, without allowing them\r\nrepresentatives in Parliament.\r\n\r\n\"That the Colonists have always been indirectly taxed by the mother\r\ncountry (besides paying the taxes necessarily laid on by their own\r\nassemblies) inasmuch as they are obliged to purchase the manufactures\r\nof Britain, charged with innumerable heavy taxes; some of which\r\nmanufactures they could make, and others could purchase cheaper at\r\nother markets.\r\n\r\n\"That the Colonists are besides taxed by the mother country, by being\r\nobliged to carry great part of their produce to Britain, and accept a\r\nlower price, than they might have at other markets. The difference is\r\na tax paid to Britain.\r\n\r\n\"That the whole wealth of the Colonists centres at last in the mother\r\ncountry, which enables her to pay her taxes.\r\n\r\n\"That the Colonies have, at the hazard of their lives and fortunes,\r\nextended the dominions, and increased the commerce and riches of the\r\nmother country, that therefore the Colonists do not deserve to be\r\ndeprived of the native right of Britons, the right of being taxed\r\nonly by representatives chosen by themselves.\r\n\r\n\"That an adequate representation in parliament would probably be\r\nacceptable to the Colonists, and would best raise the views and\r\ninterests of the whole empire.\"\r\n\r\nThe last of these propositions seems not to have been well\r\nconsidered, because an adequate representation in parliament,\r\nis totally impracticable; but the others have exhausted the\r\nsubject. If any one should ask what authority or evidence I have\r\nof this anecdote, I refer to the second volume of the Political\r\nDisquisitions, page 276, 7, 8, 9. A book which ought to be in the\r\nhands of every American who has learned to read.\r\n\r\nWhether the ministry at home or the junto here, were discouraged\r\nby these masterly remarks, or by any other cause, the project of\r\ntaxing the Colonies was laid aside. Mr. Shirley was removed from this\r\ngovernment, and Mr. Pownal was placed in his stead.\r\n\r\nMr. Pownal seems to have been a friend to liberty and to our\r\nConstitution, and to have had an aversion to all plots against\r\neither, and consequently to have given his confidence to other\r\npersons than Hutchinson and Oliver, who, stung with envy against\r\nMr. Pratt and others, who had the lead in affairs, set themselves,\r\nby propagating slanders against the Governor, among the people, and\r\nespecially among the clergy, to raise discontents, and make him\r\nuneasy in his seat. Pownal averse to wrangling, and fond of the\r\ndelights of England, solicited to be recalled, and after some time\r\nMr. Bernard was removed from New Jersey to the chair of this Province.\r\n\r\nBernard was the man for the purpose of the junto; educated in the\r\nhighest principles of monarchy, naturally daring and courageous,\r\nskilled enough in law and policy to do mischief, and avaricious\r\nto a most infamous degree; needy at the same time, and having a\r\nnumerous family to provide for,--he was an instrument, suitable\r\nin every respect, excepting one, for this junto, to employ. The\r\nexception I mean, was blunt frankness, very opposite to that cautious\r\ncunning, that deep dissimulation, to which they had by long practice\r\ndisciplined themselves. However, they did not despair of teaching him\r\nthis necessary artful quality by degrees, and the event shewed they\r\nwere not wholly unsuccessful, in their endeavors to do it.\r\n\r\nWhile the war lasted, these simple Provinces were of too much\r\nimportance in the conduct of it, to be disgusted, by any open attempt\r\nagainst their liberties. The junto therefore, contented themselves\r\nwith preparing their ground by extending their connection and\r\ncorrespondencies in England, and by conciliating the friendship of\r\nthe crown officers occasionally here, and insinuating their designs\r\nas necessary to be undertaken in some future favorable opportunity,\r\nfor the good of the empire, as well as of the Colonies.\r\n\r\nThe designs of Providence are inscrutable. It affords to bad men\r\nconjunctures favourable for their designs, as well as to good.\r\nThe conclusion of the peace, was the most critical opportunity\r\nfor our junto, that could have presented. A peace founded on the\r\ndestruction of that system of policy, the most glorious for the\r\nnation, that ever was formed, and which was never equalled in the\r\nconduct of the English government, except in the interregnum, and\r\nperhaps in the reign of Elizabeth; which system however, by its being\r\nabruptly broken off and its chief conductor discarded before it was\r\ncompleted, proved unfortunate to the nation by leaving it sinking in\r\na bottomless gulf of debt, oppressed and borne down with taxes.\r\n\r\nAt this lucky time, when the British financier, was driven out of his\r\nwits for ways and means, to supply the demands upon him, Bernard is\r\nemployed by the junto, to suggest to him the project of taxing the\r\nColonies by act of Parliament.\r\n\r\nI do not advance this without evidence. I appeal to a publication\r\nmade by Sir Francis Bernard himself, the last year of his own select\r\nletters on the trade and government of America, and the principles of\r\nlaw and polity applied to the American Colonies. I shall make much\r\nuse of this pamphlet before I have done.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1764, Mr. Bernard transmitted home to different noblemen,\r\nand gentlemen, four copies of his principles of law and polity,\r\nwith a preface, which proves incontestibly, that the project of\r\nnew regulating the American Colonies were not first suggested to\r\nhim by the ministry, but by him to them. The words of this preface\r\nare these:--\"The present expectation, that a new regulation of the\r\nAmerican governments will soon take place, probably arises more from\r\nthe opinion the public has of the abilities of the present ministry,\r\nthan from any thing that has transpired from the cabinet; it cannot\r\nbe supposed that their penetration can overlook the necessity of\r\nsuch a regulation, nor their public spirit fail to carry it into\r\nexecution. But it may be a question, whether the present is a proper\r\ntime for this work; more urgent business may stand before it, some\r\npreparatory steps may be required to precede it; but these will only\r\nserve to postpone. As we may expect that this reformation, like all\r\nothers, will be opposed by powerful prejudices, it may not be amiss\r\nto reason with them at leisure, and endeavor to take off their force\r\nbefore they become opposed to government.\"\r\n\r\nThese are the words of that arch enemy of North America, written in\r\n1764, and then transmitted to four persons, with a desire that they\r\nmight be communicated to others.\r\n\r\nUpon these words, it is impossible not to observe, first, That the\r\nministry had never signified to him, any intention of new regulating\r\nthe Colonies; and therefore, that it was he who most officiously\r\nand impertinently put them upon the pursuit of this _will with a\r\nwhisp_, which has led him and them into so much mire. 2. The artful\r\nflattery with which he insinuates these projects into the minds of\r\nthe ministry, as matters of absolute necessity, which their great\r\npenetration could not fail to discover, nor their great regard to\r\nthe public, omit. 3. The importunity with which he urges a speedy\r\naccomplishment of his pretended reformation of the governments, and\r\n4. His consciousness that these schemes would be opposed, although\r\nhe affects to expect from powerful prejudices only, that opposition,\r\nwhich all Americans say, has been dictated by sound reason, true\r\npolicy, and eternal justice. The last thing I shall take notice of\r\nis, the artful, yet most false and wicked insinuation, that such\r\nnew regulations were then generally expected. This is so absolutely\r\nfalse, that excepting Bernard himself, and his junto, scarcely any\r\nbody on this side the water had any suspicion of it,--insomuch that\r\nif Bernard had made public, at that time, his preface and principles,\r\nas he sent them to the ministry, it is much to be doubted whether he\r\ncould have lived in this country--certain it is, he would have had no\r\nfriends in this province out of the junto.\r\n\r\nThe intention of the junto, was, to procure a revenue to be raised\r\nin America by act of parliament. Nothing was further from their\r\ndesigns and wishes, than the drawing or sending this revenue into the\r\nexchequer in England to be spent there in discharging the national\r\ndebt, and lessening the burdens of the poor people there. They\r\nwere more selfish. They chose to have the fingering of the money\r\nthemselves. Their design was, that the money should be applied, first\r\nin a large salary to the governor. This would gratify Bernard's\r\navarice, and then it would render him and all other governors, not\r\nonly independent of the people, but still more absolutely a slave to\r\nthe will of the minister. They intended likewise a salary for the\r\nlieutenant governor. This would appease in some degree the gnawings\r\nof Hutchinson's avidity, in which he was not a whit behind Bernard\r\nhimself. In the next place, they intended a salary to the judges of\r\nthe common law, as well as admiralty. And thus the whole government,\r\nexecutive and judicial, was to be rendered wholly independent of the\r\npeople, (and their representatives rendered useless, insignificant\r\nand even burthensome) and absolutely dependant upon, and under the\r\ndirection of the will of the minister of State. They intended further\r\nto new model the whole continent of North America, make an entire\r\nnew division of it, into distinct, though more extensive and less\r\nnumerous Colonies, to sweep away all the charters upon the continent,\r\nwith the destroying besom of an act of parliament, and reduce all the\r\ngovernments to the plan of the royal governments, with a nobility in\r\neach Colony, not hereditary indeed, at first, but for life. They did\r\nindeed flatter the ministry and people in England, with distant hopes\r\nof a revenue from America, at some future period, to be appropriated\r\nto national uses there. But this was not to happen in their minds\r\nfor some time. The governments must be new modelled, new regulated,\r\nreformed first and then the governments here would be able and\r\nwilling to carry into execution any acts of Parliament or measures of\r\nthe ministry, for fleecing the people here, to pay debts, or support\r\npensioners, on the American establishment, or bribe electors, or\r\nmembers of parliament, or any other purpose that a virtuous ministry\r\ncould desire.\r\n\r\nBut as ill luck would have it, the British financier, was as selfish\r\nas themselves, and instead of raising money for them, chose to raise\r\nit for himself. He put the cart before the horse. He chose to get\r\nthe revenue into the exchequer, because he had hungry cormorants\r\nenough about him in England whose _cooings_ were more troublesome to\r\nhis ears, than the croaking of the ravens in America. And he thought\r\nif America could afford any revenue at all, and he could get it by\r\nauthority of parliament, he might have it himself, to give to his\r\nfriends, as well as raise it for the junto here, to spend themselves,\r\nor give to theirs. This unfortunate preposterous improvement of Mr.\r\nGrenville, upon the plan of the junto, had well nigh ruined the whole.\r\n\r\nI will proceed no further without producing my evidence. Indeed to\r\na man who was acquainted with this junto, and had any opportunity\r\nto watch their motions, observe their language, and remark their\r\ncountenances, for these last twelve years, no other evidence is\r\nnecessary; it was plain to such persons, what this junto was about.\r\nBut we have evidence enough now under their own hands of the whole of\r\nwhat was said of them by their opposers, through this whole period.\r\n\r\nGovernor Bernard, in his letter July 11, 1764, says, \"that a general\r\nreformation of the American governments would become not only a\r\ndesirable but a necessary measure.\" What his idea was, of a general\r\nreformation of the American governments, is to be learnt from his\r\nprinciples of law and polity, which he sent to the ministry in 1764.\r\nI shall select a few of them in his own words; but I wish the whole\r\nof them could be printed in the newspapers, that America might know\r\nmore generally the principles and designs and exertions of our junto.\r\n\r\nHis 29th proposition is, \"The rule that a British subject shall not\r\nbe bound by laws, or liable to taxes, but what he has consented\r\nto, by his representatives, must be confined to the inhabitants of\r\nGreat Britain only; and is not strictly true even there. 30. The\r\nparliament of Great Britain, as well from its rights of sovereignty,\r\nas from occasional exigences, has a right to make laws for and impose\r\ntaxes upon its subjects in its external dominions, although they are\r\nnot represented in such parliament. But 31. Taxes imposed upon the\r\nexternal dominions, ought to be applied to the use of the people,\r\nfrom whom they are raised. 32. The parliament of Great Britain has\r\na right and duty to take care to provide for the defence of the\r\nAmerican Colonies; especially as such Colonies are unable to defend\r\nthemselves. 33. The parliament of Great Britain has a right and a\r\nduty to take care that provision be made for a sufficient support of\r\nthe American governments. Because 34. The support of the government\r\nis one of the principal conditions upon which a Colony is allowed the\r\npower of legislation. Also because 35. Some of the American Colonies\r\nhave shewn themselves deficient in the support of their several\r\ngovernments, both as to sufficiency and independency.\"\r\n\r\nHis 75th proposition is, \"Every American government is capable of\r\nhaving its constitution altered for the better. 76. The grants of the\r\npowers of governments to the American Colonies by charters cannot\r\nbe understood to be intended for other than their infant or growing\r\nStates. 77. They cannot be intended for their mature state, that is\r\nfor perpetuity; because they are in many things unconstitutional\r\nand contrary to the very nature of a British government; therefore\r\n78. They must be considered as designed only as temporary means,\r\nfor settling and bringing forward the peopling the Colonies; which\r\nbeing effected, the cause of the peculiarity of their constitution\r\nceases. 79. If the charters can be pleaded against the authority of\r\nParliament they amount to an alienation of the dominions of Great\r\nBritain, and are in effect acts of dismembering the British empire,\r\nand will operate as such, if care is not taken to prevent it. 83.\r\nThe notion which has heretofore prevailed, that the dividing America\r\ninto many governments, and different modes of government will be\r\nthe means to prevent their uniting to revolt, is ill founded;\r\nsince, if the governments were ever so much consolidated, it will\r\nbe necessary to have so many distinct States, as to make a union to\r\nrevolt, impracticable. Whereas 84. The splitting America into many\r\nsmall governments, weakens the governing power, and strengthens that\r\nof the people; and thereby makes revolting more probable and more\r\npracticable. 85. To prevent revolts in future times (for there is\r\nno room to fear them in the present) the most effectual means would\r\nbe, to make the governments large and respectable, and balance the\r\npowers of them. 86. There is no government in America at present,\r\nwhose powers are properly balanced; there not being in any of them,\r\na real and distinct third legislative power mediating between the\r\nking and the people, which is the peculiar excellence of the British\r\nconstitution. 87. The want of such a third legislative power, adds\r\nweight to the popular, and lightens the royal scale; so as to destroy\r\nthe balance between the royal and popular powers. 88. Although\r\nAmerica is not now (and probably will not be for many years to come)\r\nripe enough for an hereditary nobility; yet it is now capable of a\r\nnobility for life. 89. A nobility appointed by the king for life,\r\nand made independent, would probably give strength and stability to\r\nthe American governments, as effectually as an hereditary nobility\r\ndoes to that of Great Britain. 90. The reformation of American\r\ngovernments should not be controuled by the present boundaries of\r\nthe Colonies; as they were mostly settled upon partial, occasional,\r\nand accidental considerations, without any regard to a whole. 91. To\r\nsettle the American governments to the greatest possible advantage,\r\nit will be necessary to reduce the number of them; in some places to\r\nunite and consolidate, in others to separate and transfer; and in\r\ngeneral to divide by natural boundaries, instead of imaginary lines.\r\n92. If there should be but one form of government established for\r\nall the North American provinces, it would greatly facilitate the\r\nreformation of them; since, if the mode of government was every where\r\nthe same, people would be more indifferent under what division they\r\nwere ranged. 93. No objections ought to arise to the alteration of\r\nthe boundaries of provinces from proprietors, on account of their\r\nproperty only; since there is no occasion that it should in the least\r\naffect the boundaries of properties. 94. The present distinction of\r\none government being more free or more popular than another, tend\r\nto embarrass and to weaken the whole; and should not be allowed\r\nto subsist among people, subject to one king and one law, and all\r\nequally fit for one form of government. 95. The American Colonies, in\r\ngeneral, are, at this time, arrived at that state, which qualifies\r\nthem to receive the most perfect form of government; which their\r\nsituation and relation to Great Britain, make them capable of. 96.\r\nThe people of North America, at this time, expect a revisal and\r\nreformation of the American governments, and are better disposed to\r\nsubmit to it, than ever they were, or perhaps ever will be again.\r\n97. This is therefore the proper, and critical time to reform the\r\nAmerican governments, upon a general, constitutional, firm, and\r\ndurable plan; and if it is not done now, it will probably every day\r\ngrow more difficult, till at last it becomes impracticable.\"\r\n\r\nMy friends, these are the words, the plans, principles, and\r\nendeavours of governor Bernard in the year 1764. That Hutchinson and\r\nOliver, notwithstanding all their disguises which you well remember,\r\nwere in unison with him in the whole of his measures, can be doubted\r\nby no man. It appeared sufficiently in the part they all along acted,\r\nnotwithstanding their professions. And it appears incontestibly from\r\ntheir detected letters, of which more hereafter.\r\n\r\nNow let me ask you, if the parliament of Great Britain, had all the\r\nnatural foundations of authority, wisdom, goodness, justice, power,\r\nin as great perfection as they ever existed in any body of men since\r\nAdam's fall; and if the English nation was the most virtuous, pure\r\nand free, that ever was; would not such an unlimited subjection\r\nof three millions of people to that parliament, at three thousand\r\nmiles distance be real slavery? There are but two sorts of men in\r\nthe world, freemen and slaves. The very definition of a freeman, is\r\none who is bound by no law to which he has not consented. Americans\r\nwould have no way of giving or withholding their consent to the acts\r\nof this parliament, therefore they would not be freemen. But, when\r\nluxury, effeminacy and venality are arrived at such a shocking pitch\r\nin England, when both electors and elected, are become one mass\r\nof corruption, when the nation is oppressed to death with debts\r\nand taxes, owing to their own extravagance, and want of wisdom,\r\nwhat would be your condition under such an absolute subjection to\r\nparliament? You would not only be slaves. But the most abject sort\r\nof slaves to the worst sort of masters! at least this is my opinion.\r\nJudge you for yourselves between Massachusettensis and\r\n\r\nNOVANGLUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESSED\r\n\r\n_To the Inhabitants of the Colony of Massachusetts Bay_,\r\n\r\nFebruary 6, 1775.\r\n\r\n\r\nMY FRIENDS,\r\n\r\nThe history of the tories, began in my last, will be interrupted for\r\nsome time; but it shall be reassumed, and minutely related, in some\r\nfuture papers. Massachusettensis, who shall now be pursued, in his\r\nown serpentine path; in his first paper, complains, that the press is\r\nnot free, that a party has gained the ascendency so far as to become\r\nthe licencers of it; by playing off the resentment of the populace,\r\nagainst printers and authors: That the press is become an engine\r\nof oppression and licentiousness, much devoted to the partisans of\r\nliberty, who have been indulged in publishing what they pleased, _fas\r\nvel nefas_, while little has been published on the part of government.\r\n\r\nThe art of this writer which appears in all his productions, is very\r\nconspicuous in this. It is intended to excite a resentment against\r\nthe friends of liberty, for tyrannically depriving their antagonists,\r\nof so important a branch of freedom, and a compassion towards the\r\ntories, in the breasts of the people in the other Colonies and in\r\nGreat Britain, by insinuating, that they have not had equal terms.\r\nBut nothing can be more injurious, nothing farther from the truth.\r\nLet us take a retrospective view of the period, since the last\r\npeace, and see, whether they have not uniformly had the press at\r\ntheir service, without the least molestation to authors or printers.\r\nIndeed, I believe that the Massachusetts Spy, if not the Boston\r\nGazette have been open to them as well as to others. The Evening\r\nPost, Massachusetts Gazette and Boston Chronicle, have certainly been\r\nalways as free for their use as the air. Let us dismiss prejudice\r\nand passion, and examine impartially, whether the tories have not\r\nbeen chargeable with at least as many libels, as much licentiousness\r\nof the press, as the whigs? Dr. Mayhew was a whig of the first\r\nmagnitude, a clergyman equalled by very few of any denomination in\r\npiety, virtue, genius or learning, whose works will maintain his\r\ncharacter, as long as New England shall be free, integrity esteemed,\r\nor wit, spirit, humour, or reason and knowledge admired. How was he\r\ntreated from the press? Did not the reverend tories who were pleased\r\nto write against him, the missionaries of defamation as well as\r\nbigotry and passive obedience, in their pamphlets, and news papers,\r\nbespatter him all over with their filth? With equal falsehood and\r\nmalice charge him with every thing evil? Mr. Otis, was in civil life;\r\nand a senator, whose parts, literature, eloquence and integrity,\r\nproved him a character in the world, equal to any of the time in\r\nwhich he flourished, of any party in the province. Now be pleased\r\nto recollect the Evening Post. For a long course of years, that\r\ngentleman, his friends and connexions, of whom the world has, and\r\ngrateful posterity will have a better opinion than Massachusettensis\r\nwill acknowledge, were pelted with the most infernally malicious,\r\nfalse, and atrocious libels, that ever issued from any press in\r\nBoston. I will mention no other names, lest I give too much offence\r\nto the modesty of some, and the envy and rancour of others.\r\n\r\nThere never was before, in any part of the world, a whole town\r\ninsulted to their faces, as Boston was, by the Boston Chronicle. Yet\r\nthe printer was not molested for printing, it was his mad attack upon\r\nother printers with his clubs, and upon other gentlemen with his\r\npistols, that was the cause of his flight, or rather the pretence.\r\nThe truth was, he became too polite to attend his business, his shop\r\nwas neglected, procreations [Errata: procurations] were coming for\r\nmore than 2000 sterling, which he had no inclination to pay.\r\n\r\nPrinters may have been less eager after the productions of the tories\r\nthan of the whigs, and the reason has been because the latter have\r\nbeen more consonant to the general taste and sense, and consequently\r\nmore in demand. Notwithstanding this, the former have ever found\r\none press at least devoted to their service, and have used it as\r\nlicentiously as they could wish. Whether the revenue chest has kept\r\nit alive and made it profitable against the general sense, or not,\r\nI wot not. Thus much is certain that 200, 3, 4, 5, 600, 800, 1500\r\nsterling a year, has been the constant reward of every scribbler,\r\nwho has taken up the pen on the side of the ministry, with any\r\nreputation, and commissions have been given here for the most\r\nwretched productions of dulness itself. Whereas the writers on the\r\nside of liberty, have been rewarded only with the consciousness of\r\nendeavouring to do good, with the approbation of the virtuous and the\r\nmalice of men in power.\r\n\r\nBut this is not the first time, that writers have taken advantage of\r\nthe times. Massachusettensis knows the critical situation of this\r\nProvince. The danger it is in, without government or law: The army\r\nin Boston.--The people irritated and exasperated, in such a manner\r\nas was never before borne by any people under Heaven. Much depends\r\nupon their patience at this critical time, and such an example of\r\npatience and order, this people have exhibited in a state of nature,\r\nunder such cruel insults, distresses and provocations, as the history\r\nof mankind cannot parallel. In this state of things protected by\r\nan army, the whole junto are now pouring forth the whole torrents\r\nof their Billingsgate, propagating thousands of the most palpable\r\nfalsehoods, when they know that the writers on the other side have\r\nbeen restrained by their prudence and caution from engaging in a\r\ncontroversy that must excite heats, lest it should have unhappy and\r\ntragical consequences.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing in this world so excellent that it may not be\r\nabused. The abuses of the press are notorious. It is much to be\r\ndesired that writers on all sides would be more careful of truth and\r\ndecency: but upon the most impartial estimate, the tories will be\r\nfound to have been the least so, of any party among us.\r\n\r\nThe honest Veteran, who ought not to be forgotten, in this place,\r\nsays, \"if an inhabitant of Bern or Amsterdam, could read the\r\nnewspapers, &c. he would be at a loss how to reconcile oppression\r\nwith such unbounded licence of the press: and would laugh at the\r\ncharge, as something much more than a paradox, as a palpable\r\ncontradiction.\" But with all his taste, and manly spirit, the Veteran\r\nis little of a statesman. His ideas of liberty are quite inadequate;\r\nhis notions of government very superficial. License of the press\r\nis no proof of liberty. When a people is corrupted, the press may\r\nbe made an engine to complete their ruin: and it is now notorious,\r\nthat the ministry, are daily employing it to encrease and establish\r\ncorruption, and to pluck up virtue by the roots. Liberty can no more\r\nexist without virtue and independence, than the body can live and\r\nmove without a soul. When these are gone, and the popular branch\r\nof the constitution is become dependant on the minister, as it is\r\nin England, or cut off as it is in America, all other forms of the\r\nconstitution may remain; but if you look for liberty, you will grope\r\nin vain, and the freedom of the press, instead of promoting the cause\r\nof liberty, will but hasten its destruction, as the best cordials\r\ntaken by patients, in some distempers, become the most rancid and\r\ncorrosive poisons.\r\n\r\nThe language of the Veteran, however, is like the style of the\r\nminister and his scribblers in England boasting of the unbounded\r\nfreedom of the press, and assuring the people that all is safe, while\r\nthat continues; and thus the people are to be cheated with libels in\r\nexchange for their liberties.\r\n\r\nA stronger proof cannot be wished, of the scandalous license of the\r\ntory presses, than the swarms of pamphlets and speculations, in New\r\nYork and Boston, since last October. \"Madness, folly, delusion,\r\ndelirium, infatuation, phrensy, high treason and rebellion,\" are\r\ncharged in every page, upon three millions of as good and loyal, as\r\nsensible and virtuous people, as any in the empire: nay upon that\r\ncongress, which was as full and free a representative, as ever was\r\nconstituted by any people, chosen universally without solicitation,\r\nor the least tincture of corruption: that congress which consisted\r\nof governors, counsellors, some of them by mandamus too, judges of\r\nsupreme courts, speakers of assemblies, planters and merchants of the\r\nfirst fortune and character, and lawyers of the highest class, many\r\nof them educated at the temple, called to the bar in England, and of\r\nabilities and integrity equal to any there.\r\n\r\nMassachusettensis, conscious that the people of this continent have\r\nthe utmost abhorrence of treason and rebellion, labours to avail\r\nhimself of the magic in these words. But his artifice is vain. The\r\npeople are not to be intimidated by hard words, from a necessary\r\ndefence of their liberties: Their attachment to their constitution\r\nso dearly purchased by their own and their ancestors blood and\r\ntreasure, their aversion to the late innovations, their horror of\r\narbitrary power and the Romish religion, are much deeper rooted\r\nthan their dread of rude sounds and unmannerly language. They do\r\nnot want the advice of an honest lawyer, if such an one could be\r\nfound, nor will they be deceived by a dishonest one. They know what\r\noffence it is, to assemble, armed and forcibly obstruct the course\r\nof justice. They have been many years considering and inquiring,\r\nthey have been instructed by Massachusettensis and his friends, in\r\nthe nature of treason, and the consequences of their own principles\r\nand actions. They know upon what hinge the whole dispute turns. That\r\nthe _fundamentals_ of the government over them, are disputed, that\r\nthe minister pretends and had the influence to obtain the voice\r\nof the last parliament in his favour, that parliament is the only\r\nsupreme, sovereign, absolute and uncontroulable legislative over\r\nall the Colonies, that therefore the minister and all his advocates\r\nwill call resistance, to acts of parliament, by the names of treason\r\nand rebellion. But at the same time they know, that in their own\r\nopinions, and in the opinions of all the Colonies, parliament has\r\nno authority over them, excepting to regulate their trade, and this\r\nnot by any principle of common law, but merely by the consent of the\r\nColonies, founded on the obvious necessity of a case, which was never\r\nin contemplation of that law, nor provided for by it; that therefore\r\nthey have as good a right to charge that minister, Massachusettensis\r\nand the whole army to which he has fled for protection, with treason\r\nand rebellion. For if the parliament has not a legal authority to\r\noverturn their constitution, and subject them to such acts as are\r\nlately passed, every man, who accepts of any commission and takes any\r\nsteps to carry those acts into execution, is guilty of overt acts\r\nof treason and rebellion against his majesty, his royal crown and\r\ndignity, as much as if he should take arms against his troops, or\r\nattempt his sacred life. They know that the resistance against the\r\nstampt act, which was made through all America, was in the opinion\r\nof Massachusettensis, and George Grenville, high treason, and that\r\nBrigadier Ruggles, and good Mr. Ogden, pretended at the congress\r\nat New York, to be of the same mind, and have been held in utter\r\ncontempt and derision by the whole continent, for the same reason,\r\never since; because in their own opinion, that resistance was a noble\r\nstand against tyranny, and the only opposition to it, which could\r\nhave been effectual. That if the American resistance to the act for\r\ndestroying your charter, and to the resolves for arresting persons\r\nhere and sending them to England for trial is treason, the lords and\r\ncommons, and the whole nation, were traitors at the revolution.\r\n\r\nThey know that all America is united in sentiment, and in the plan of\r\nopposition to the claims of administration and parliament. The junto\r\nin Boston, with their little flocks of adherents in the country, are\r\nnot worth taking into the account; and the army and navy, though\r\nthese are divided among themselves, are no part of America; in\r\norder to judge of this union, they begin at the commencement of the\r\ndispute, and run through the whole course of it. At the time of the\r\nStamp Act, every Colony expressed its sentiments by resolves of their\r\nassemblies, and every one agreed that parliament had no right to\r\ntax the Colonies. The house of representatives of the Massachusetts\r\nBay, then consisted of many persons, who have since figured as\r\nfriends to government; yet every member of that house concurred most\r\ncheerfully in the resolves then passed. The congress which met that\r\nyear at New York, expressed the same opinion in their resolves, after\r\nthe paint, paper and tea act was passed. The several assemblies\r\nexpressed the same sentiments, and when your Colony wrote the famous\r\ncircular letter, notwithstanding all the mandates and threats, and\r\ncajoling of the minister and the several governors, and all the crown\r\nofficers through the continent, the assemblies with one voice echoed\r\ntheir entire approbation of that letter, and their applause to your\r\nColony for sending it. In the year 1768, when a non importation was\r\nsuggested and planned by a few gentlemen at a private club, in one\r\nof our large towns, as soon as it was proposed to the public, did it\r\nnot spread through the whole continent? Was it not regarded, like the\r\nlaws of the Medes and Persians, in almost all the Colonies? When the\r\npaint and paper act was repealed, the southern Colonies agreed to\r\ndepart from the association in all things but the dutied articles,\r\nbut they have kept strictly to their agreement against importing\r\nthem, so that no tea worth the mentioning, has been imported into\r\nany of them from Great Britain to this day. In the year 1770, when\r\na number of persons were slaughtered in King Street, such was the\r\nbrotherly sympathy of all the Colonies, such their resentment against\r\nan hostile administration; that the innocent blood then spilt, has\r\nnever been forgotten, nor the murderous minister and governors, who\r\nbrought the troops here, forgiven, by any part of the continent,\r\nand never will be. When a certain masterly statesman, invented a\r\ncommittee of correspondence in Boston, which has provoked so much of\r\nthe spleen of Massachusettensis, of which much more hereafter; did\r\nnot every Colony, nay every county, city, hundred and town upon the\r\nwhole continent, adopt the measure? I had almost said, as if it had\r\nbeen a revelation from above, as the happiest means of cementing the\r\nunion and acting in concert? What proofs of union have been given\r\nsince the last March? Look over the resolves of the several Colonies,\r\nand you will see that one understanding governs, one heart animates\r\nthe whole body. Assemblies, conventions, congresses, towns, cities,\r\nand private clubs and circles, have been actuated by one great, wise,\r\nactive and noble spirit, one masterly soul, animating one vigorous\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nThe congress at Philadelphia, have expressed the same sentiments\r\nwith the people of New England, approved of the opposition to the\r\nlate innovations, unanimously advised us to persevere in it, and\r\nassured us that if force is attempted to carry these measures\r\nagainst us, all America ought to support us. Maryland and the lower\r\ncounties on Delaware, have, already, to shew to all the world their\r\napprobation of the measures of New England, and their determination\r\nto join in them, with a generosity, a wisdom and magnanimity, which\r\nought to make the tories consider, taken the power of the militia\r\ninto the hands of the people, without the governor, or minister,\r\nand established it, by their own authority, for the defence of the\r\nMassachusetts, as well as of themselves. Other Colonies are only\r\nwaiting to see if the necessity of it will become more obvious.\r\nVirginia, and the Carolinas, are preparing for military defence, and\r\nhave been for some time. When we consider the variety of climates,\r\nsoils, religious, civil governments, commercial interests, &c. which\r\nwere represented at the congress, and the various occupations,\r\neducations, and characters of the gentlemen who composed it, the\r\nharmony and unanimity which prevailed in it, can scarcely be\r\nparalleled in any assembly that ever met. When we consider, that\r\nat the revolution, such mighty questions, as whether the throne\r\nwas vacant or not, and whether the Prince of Orange should be\r\nking or not, were determined in the convention of parliament by\r\nsmall majorities of two or three; and four or five only; the great\r\nmajorities, the almost unanimity with which all great questions have\r\nbeen decided in your house of representatives, and other assemblies,\r\nand especially in the continental congress, cannot be considered in\r\nany other light than as the happiest omens indeed, as providential\r\ndispensations in our favour, as well as the clearest demonstrations\r\nof the cordial, firm, radical and indissoluble union of the Colonies.\r\n\r\nThe grand aphorism of the policy of the whigs has been to unite the\r\npeople of America, and divide those of Great Britain: The reverse\r\nof this has been the maxim of the tories, viz:--To unite the people\r\nof Great Britain, and divide those of America: All the movements,\r\nmarches and countermarches of both parties, on both sides of the\r\nAtlantic, may be reduced to one or the other of these rules. I have\r\nshewn, in opposition to Massachusettensis, that the people of\r\nAmerica are united more perfectly than the most sanguine whig could\r\never have hoped, or than the most timid tory could have feared. Let\r\nus now examine whether the people of Great Britain are equally united\r\nagainst us. For if the contending countries were equally united, the\r\nprospect of success in the quarrel would depend upon the comparative\r\nwisdom, firmness, strength and other advantages of each. And if such\r\na comparison was made, it would not appear to a demonstration that\r\nGreat Britain could so easily subdue and conquer. It is not so easy\r\na thing for the most powerful State to conquer a country a thousand\r\nleagues off. How many years time, how many millions of money, did it\r\ntake, with five and thirty thousand men, to conquer the poor province\r\nof Canada? And after all the battles and victories, it never would\r\nhave submitted without a capitulation, which secured to them their\r\nreligion and properties.\r\n\r\nBut we know that the people of Great Britain are not united against\r\nus. We distinguish between the ministry, the house of commons, the\r\nofficers of the army, navy, excise, customs, &c. who are dependent on\r\nthe ministry and tempted, if not obliged, to echo their voices; and\r\nthe body of the people. We are assured by thousands of letters from\r\npersons of good intelligence, by the general strain of publications\r\nin public papers, pamphlets, and magazines, and by some larger works\r\nwritten for posterity, that the body of the people are friends to\r\nAmerica, and wish us success in our struggles against the claims of\r\nparliament and administration. We know that millions in England and\r\nScotland, will think it unrighteous, impolitic and ruinous, to make\r\nwar upon us, and a minister, though he may have a marble heart, will\r\nproceed with a diffident, desponding spirit. We know that London\r\nand Bristol the two greatest commercial cities in the empire, have\r\ndeclared themselves in the most decisive manner, in favor of our\r\ncause. So explicitly that the former has bound her members under\r\ntheir hands to assist us, and the latter has chosen two known friends\r\nof America, one attached to us by principle, birth, and the most\r\nardent affection, the other an able advocate for us on several great\r\noccasions. We know that many of the most virtuous and independent of\r\nthe nobility and gentry, are for us, and among them the best bishop\r\nthat adorns the bench, as great a judge as the nation can boast, and\r\nthe greatest statesman it ever saw. We know that the nation is loaded\r\nwith debts and taxes by the folly and iniquity of its ministers, and\r\nthat without the trade of America, it can neither long support its\r\nfleet and army, nor pay the interest of its debt.\r\n\r\nBut we are told that the nation is now united against us, that they\r\nhold they have a right to tax us and legislate for us as firmly as\r\nwe deny it. That we are a part of the British empire, that every\r\nState must have an uncontroulable power co-extensive with the\r\nempire, that there is little probability of serving ourselves by\r\ningenious distinctions between external and internal taxes. If we\r\nare not a part of the state, and subject to the supreme authority of\r\nparliament, Great Britain will make us so; that if this opportunity\r\nof reclaiming the Colonies is lost, they will be dismembered from the\r\nempire; and although they may continue their allegiance to the king\r\nthey will own none to the imperial crown.\r\n\r\nTo all this I answer, that the nation is not so united; that they do\r\nnot so universally hold they have such a right, and my reasons I have\r\ngiven before. That the terms \"British Empire\" are not the language\r\nof the common law, but the language of newspapers and political\r\npamphlets. That the dominions of the king of Great Britain has no\r\nuncontroulable power co-extensive with them. I would ask by what law\r\nthe Parliament has authority over America? By the law of GOD\r\nin the Old and New Testament, it has none: By the law of nature and\r\nnations, it has none. By the common law of England is has none.\r\nFor the common law, and the authority of parliament founded on it,\r\nnever extended beyond the four seas. By statute law it has none, for\r\nno statute was made before the settlement of the Colonies for this\r\npurpose; and the declaratory act made in 1766, was made without our\r\nconsent, by a parliament which had no authority beyond the four seas.\r\nWhat religious, moral or political obligations then are we under,\r\nto submit to parliament as a supreme legislative? None at all. When\r\nit is said, that if we are not subject to the supreme authority\r\nof parliament, Great Britain will make us so, all other laws and\r\nobligations are given up, and recourse is had to the _ratio ultima_\r\nof Louis the 14th, and the _suprema lex_ of the king of Sardinia, to\r\nthe law of brickbats and cannon balls, which can be answered only by\r\nbrickbats and balls.\r\n\r\nThis language \"the imperial crown of Great Britain,\" is not the\r\nstyle of the common law but of court sycophants. It was introduced\r\nin allusion to the Roman empire, and intended to insinuate that\r\nthe prerogative of the imperial crown of England, was like that of\r\nthe Roman emperor, after the maxim was established, _quod principi\r\nplacuit legis habet vigorem_, and so far from including the two\r\nhouses of parliament in the idea of this imperial crown, it was\r\nintended to insinuate that the crown was absolute, and had no need of\r\nlords or commons to make or dispense with laws. Yet even these court\r\nsycophants when driven to an explanation, never dared to put any\r\nother sense upon the words imperial crown than this, that the crown\r\nof England was independent of France, Spain, and all other kings and\r\nstates in the world.\r\n\r\nWhen he says that the king's dominions must have an uncontroulable\r\npower, co-extensive with them. I ask whether they have such a power\r\nor not? And utterly deny that they have by any law but that of Louis\r\nthe 14th, and the king of Sardinia. If they have not, and it is\r\nnecessary that they should have, it then follows that there is a\r\ndefect in what he calls the British empire; and how shall this defect\r\nbe supplied? It cannot be supplied consistently with reason, justice,\r\npolicy, morality, or humanity, without the consent of the Colonies\r\nand some new plan of connection. But if Great Britain will set all\r\nthese at defiance, and resort to the _ratio ultima_, all Europe will\r\npronounce her a tyrant, and America never will submit to her, be the\r\ndanger of disobedience as great as it will.\r\n\r\nBut there is no need of any other power than that of regulating\r\ntrade, and this the Colonies ever have been and will be ready and\r\nwilling to concede to her. But she will never obtain from America any\r\nfurther concession while she exists. We are then asked, \"for what\r\nshe protected and defended the Colonies against the maritime power\r\nof Europe from their first settlement to this day?\" I answer for her\r\nown interest, because all the profits of our trade centered in her\r\nlap. But it ought to be remembered, that her name, not her purse, nor\r\nher fleets and armies, ever protected us, until the last war, and\r\nthen the minister who conducted that war, informs us, that the annual\r\nmillions from America enabled her to do it.\r\n\r\nWe are then asked for what she purchased New York of the Dutch? I\r\nanswer she never did. The Dutch never owned it, were never more\r\nthan trespassers and intruders there, and were finally expelled by\r\nconquest. It was ceded it is true by the treaty of Breda, and it is\r\nsaid in some authors, that some other territory in India was ceded to\r\nthe Dutch in lieu of it. But this was the transaction of the king,\r\nnot of parliament, and therefore makes nothing to the argument. But\r\nadmitting for argument sake, (since the cautious Massachusettensis\r\nwill urge us into the discussion of such questions) what is not a\r\nsupposable case, that the nation should be so sunk in sloth, luxury,\r\nand corruption, as to suffer their minister to persevere in his mad\r\nblunders and send fire and sword against us, how shall we defend\r\nourselves? The Colonies south of Pennsylvania have no men to spare we\r\nare told. But we know better--we know that all those Colonies have a\r\nback country which is inhabited by an hardy, robust people, many of\r\nwhom are emigrants from New England, and habituated like multitudes\r\nof New England men, to carry their fuzees or rifles upon one shoulder\r\nto defend themselves against the Indians, while they carried their\r\naxes, scythes and hoes upon the other to till the ground. Did not\r\nthose Colonies furnish men the last war excepting Maryland? Did\r\nnot Virginia furnish men, one regiment particularly equal to any\r\nregular regiment in the service? Does the soft Massachusettensis\r\nimagine that in the unnatural horrid war, he is now supposing their\r\nexertions would be less? If he does he is very ill informed of their\r\nprinciples, their present sentiments and temper. But \"have you arms\r\nand ammunition?\" I answer we have; but if we had not, we could make\r\na sufficient quantity for both. What should hinder? We have many\r\nmanufacturers of fire arms now, whose arms are as good as any in\r\nthe world. Powder has been made here, and may be again, and so may\r\nsalt-petre. What should hinder? We have all the materials in great\r\nabundance, and the process is very simple. But if we neither had\r\nthem nor could make them, we could import them. But \"the British\r\nnavy\" aye there's the rub. But let us consider, since the prudent\r\nMassachusettensis will have these questions debated. How many ships\r\nare taken to blockade Boston harbour? How many ships can Britain\r\nspare to carry on this humane and political war, the object of which\r\nis a pepper corn! let her send all the ships she has round her\r\nisland. What if her ill natured neighbours, France and Spain should\r\nstrike a blow in their absence? In order to judge what they could\r\nall do when they arrived here we should consider what they are all\r\nable to do round the island of Great Britain. We know that the utmost\r\nvigilance and exertions of them added to all the terms [Errata:\r\nterrors] of sanguinary laws, are not sufficient to prevent continual\r\nsmuggling, into their own island. Are there not fifty bays, harbours,\r\ncreeks and inlets upon the whole coast of North America, where there\r\nis one round the island of Great Britain. Is it to be supposed then,\r\nthat the whole British navy could prevent the importation of arms\r\nand ammunition into America, if she should have occasion for them to\r\ndefend herself against the hellish warfare that is here supposed.\r\n\r\nBut what will you do for discipline and subordination? I answer we\r\nwill have them in as great perfection as the regular troops. If the\r\nprovincials were not brought in the last war to a proper discipline,\r\nwhat was the reason? Because regular generals would not let them\r\nfight, which they ardently wished, but employed them in cutting\r\nroads. If they had been allowed to fight they would have brought the\r\nwar to a conclusion too soon. The provincials did submit to martial\r\nlaw, and to the mutiny and desertion act the last war, and such an\r\nact may be made here by a legislature which they will obey with much\r\n[Errata: missing 'more'] alacrity than an act of parliament.\r\n\r\nThe new fangled militia as the specious Massachusettensis calls\r\nit, is such a militia as he never saw. They are commanded through\r\nthe province, not by men who procured their commissions from a\r\ngovernor as a reward for making themselves pimps to his tools, and by\r\ndiscovering a hatred of the people but by gentlemen whose estates,\r\nabilities and benevolence have rendered them the delight of the\r\nsoldiers, and there is an esteem and respect for them visible through\r\nthe province, which has not been used in the militia. Nor is there\r\nthat unsteadiness that is charged upon them. In some places, where\r\ncompanies have been split into two or three, it has only served by\r\nexciting an emulation between the companies to increase the martial\r\nspirit and skill.\r\n\r\nThe plausible Massachusettensis may write as he will, but in a land\r\nwar, this continent might defend itself against all the world. We\r\nhave men enough, and those men have as good natural understandings,\r\nand as much natural courage as any other men. If they were wholly\r\nignorant now, they might learn the art of war. But at sea we are\r\ndefenceless. A navy might burn our seaport towns. What then? If\r\nthe insinuating Massachusettensis has ever read any speculations,\r\nconcerning an Agrarian law, and I know he has, he will be satisfied\r\nthat 350,000 landholders will not give up their rights and the\r\nconstitution, by which they hold them, to save fifty thousand\r\ninhabitants of maritime towns. Will the minister be nearer his mark,\r\nafter he has burnt a beautiful town and murdered 30,000 innocent\r\npeople? So far from it, that one such event, would occasion the loss\r\nof all the Colonies to Great Britain forever. It is not so clear\r\nthat our trade, fishery and navigation, could be taken from us. Some\r\npersons, who understand this subject better than Massachusettensis,\r\nwith all his sprightly imaginations, are of a different opinion.\r\nThey think that our trade would be increased. But I will not enlarge\r\nupon this subject, because I wish the trade of this continent may be\r\nconfined to Great Britain, at least as much of it, as it can do her\r\nany good to restrain.\r\n\r\nThe Canadians and Savages are brought in to thicken the horrors of\r\na picture, with which the lively fancy of this writer has terrified\r\nhim. But although we are sensible that the Quebec act has laid a\r\nfoundation for a fabric, which if not seasonably demolished, may be\r\nformidable, if not ruinous to the Colonies, in future times, yet we\r\nknow that these times are yet at a distance; at present we hold the\r\npower of the Canadians as nothing. But we know their dispositions are\r\nnot unfriendly to us.\r\n\r\nThe Savages will be more likely to be our friends than enemies; but\r\nif they should not, we know well enough how to defend ourselves\r\nagainst them.\r\n\r\nI ought to apologize for the immoderate length of this paper. But\r\ngeneral assertions are only to be confuted by an examination of\r\nparticulars, which necessarily fills up much space. I will trespass\r\non the reader's patience only while I make one observation more upon\r\nthe art, I had almost said chicanery of this writer.\r\n\r\nHe affirms that we are not united in this province, and that\r\nassociations are forming in several parts of the province. The\r\nassociation he means has been laid before the public, and a\r\nvery curious piece of legerdemain it is. Is there any article\r\nacknowledging the authority of parliament, the unlimited authority\r\nof parliament? Brigadier Ruggles himself, Massachusettensis himself,\r\ncould not have signed it if there had, consistent with their known\r\ndeclared opinions. They associate to stand by the king's laws, and\r\nthis every whig will subscribe. But after all, what a wretched\r\nfortune has this association made in the world! the numbers who\r\nhave signed it, would appear so inconsiderable, that I dare say the\r\nBrigadier will never publish to the world their numbers or names. But\r\n\"has not Great Britain been a nursing mother to us?\" Yes, and we have\r\nbehaved as nurse children commonly do, been very fond of her, and\r\nrewarded her all along ten fold for all her care and expense in our\r\nnurture.\r\n\r\nBut \"is not our distraction owing to parliament's taking off a\r\nshilling duty on tea and imposing three pence, and is not this a more\r\nunaccountable phrensy, more disgraceful to the annals of America,\r\nthan the witchcraft?\"\r\n\r\nIs the three pence upon tea our only grievance? Are we not in this\r\nprovince deprived of the priviledge of paying our governors, judges,\r\n&c.? Are not trials by jury taken from us? Are we not sent to England\r\nfor trial? Is not a military government put over us? Is not our\r\nconstitution demolished to the foundation? Have not the ministry\r\nshewn by the Quebec bill, that we have no security against them for\r\nour religion any more than our property, if we once submit to the\r\nunlimited claims of parliament? This is so gross an attempt to impose\r\non the most ignorant of the people, that it is a shame to answer it.\r\n\r\n_Obsta principiis_--Nip the shoots of arbitrary power in the bud, is\r\nthe only maxim which can ever preserve the liberties of any people.\r\nWhen the people give way, their deceivers, betrayers and destroyers\r\npress upon them so fast that there is no resisting afterwards. The\r\nnature of the encroachment upon American constitution is such, as\r\nto grow every day more and more encroaching. Like a cancer, it\r\neats faster and faster every hour. The revenue creates pensioners\r\nand the pensioners urge for more revenue. The people grow less\r\nsteady, spirited and virtuous, the seekers more numerous and more\r\ncorrupt, and every day increases the circles of their dependants and\r\nexpectants, until virtue, integrity, public spirit, simplicity and\r\nfrugality, become the objects of ridicule and scorn, and vanity,\r\nluxury, foppery, selfishness, meanness, and downright venality\r\nswallow up the whole society.\r\n\r\nNOVANGLUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESSED\r\n\r\n_To the Inhabitants of the Colony of Massachusetts Bay_,\r\n\r\nFebruary 13, 1775.\r\n\r\n\r\nMY FRIENDS,\r\n\r\nMassachusettensis, whose pen can wheedle with the tonge of king\r\nRichard the third, in his first paper, threatens you with the\r\nvengeance of Great Britain, and assures you that if she had no\r\nauthority over you, yet she would support her claims by her fleets\r\nand armies, Canadians and Indians. In his next he alters his tone,\r\nand soothes you with the generosity, justice and humanity of the\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nI shall leave him to show how a nation can claim an authority which\r\nthey have not by right, and support it by fire and sword, and yet\r\nbe generous and just. The nation I believe is not vindictive, but\r\nthe minister has discovered himself to be so, in a degree that would\r\ndisgrace a warrior of a savage tribe.\r\n\r\nThe wily Massachusettensis thinks our present calamity is to be\r\nattributed to the bad policy of a popular party, whose measures,\r\nwhatever their intentions were, have been opposite to their\r\nprofession, the public good. The present calamity seems to be nothing\r\nmore nor less, than reviving the plans of Mr. Bernard and the junto,\r\nand Mr. Grenville and his friends in 1764. Surely this party, are and\r\nhave been rather unpopular. The popular party did not write Bernard's\r\nletters, who so long ago pressed for the demolition of all the\r\ncharters upon the continent, and a parliamentary taxation to support\r\ngovernment, and the administration of justice in America.\r\n\r\nThe popular party did not write Oliver's letters, who enforces\r\nBernard's plans, nor Hutchinson's, who pleads with all his eloquence\r\nand pathos for parliamentary penalties, ministerial vengeance and an\r\nabridgement of English liberties.\r\n\r\nThere is not in human nature a more wonderful phenomenon; nor in\r\nthe whole theory of it, a more intricate speculation; than the\r\n_shiftings_, _turnings_, _windings_ and _evasions_ of a guilty\r\nconscience. Such is our unalterable moral constitution, that an\r\ninternal inclination to do wrong, is criminal; and a wicked thought,\r\nstains the mind with guilt, and makes it tingle with pain. Hence it\r\ncomes to pass that the guilty mind, can never bear to think that its\r\nguilt is known to God or man, no, nor to itself.\r\n\r\n                        ----Cur tamen hos tu\r\n     Evasisse putes, quos diri conscia facti\r\n     Mens habet attonitos, et surdo verbere cædit\r\n     Occultum quatiente animo tortore flagellum?\r\n     Poena autem vehemens ac multo sævior illis,\r\n     Quas et Cædicius gravis invenit et Rhadamanthus,\r\n     Nocte dieque suum gestare in pectore testem.\r\n\r\n     JUV. SAT. 13. 192.\r\n\r\nMassachusettensis and his friends the tories, are startled at the\r\ncalamities they have brought upon their country, and their conscious\r\nguilt, their smarting, wounded mind, will not suffer them to confess,\r\neven to themselves, what they have done. Their silly denials of their\r\nown share in it before a people, who they know have abundant evidence\r\nagainst them, never fail to remind me of an ancient _fugitive_, whose\r\nconscience could not bear the recollection of what he had done.\r\n\"I know not, am I my brother's keeper?\" He replies, with all the\r\napparent simplicity of truth and innocence, to one from whom he was\r\nvery sensible his guilt could not be hid. The still more absurd and\r\nridiculous attempts of the tories, to throw off the blame of these\r\ncalamities from themselves to the whigs, remind me of another story,\r\nwhich I have read in the Old Testament. When Joseph's brethren had\r\nsold him to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver, in order to\r\nconceal their own avarice, malice and envy, they dip the coat of many\r\ncolours in the blood of a kid, and say that an evil beast had rent\r\nhim in pieces and devoured him.\r\n\r\nHowever, what the sons of Israel intended for ruin to Joseph, proved\r\nthe salvation of the family; and I hope and believe that the whigs,\r\nwill have the magnanimity, like him, to suppress their resentment,\r\nand the felicity of saving their ungrateful brothers.\r\n\r\nThis writer has a faculty of insinuating errors into the mind, almost\r\nimperceptibly, he dresses them so in the guise of truth. He says\r\n\"that the revenue to the crown, from America amounted to but little\r\nmore than the charges of collecting it,\" at the close of the last\r\nwar. I believe it did not amount to so much. The truth is, there\r\nwas never any pretence of raising a revenue in America before that\r\ntime, and when the claim was first set up, it gave an alarm, like a\r\nwarlike expedition against us. True it is that some duties had been\r\nlaid before by parliament, under pretence of regulating our trade,\r\nand by a collusion and combination between the West India planters,\r\nand the North American governors, some years before, duties had been\r\nlaid upon molasses, &c. under the same pretence, but in reality\r\nmerely to advance the value of the estates of the planters in the\r\nWest India Islands, and to put some plunder, under the name of thirds\r\nof seisures into the pockets of the governors. But these duties,\r\nthough more had been collected in this province, than in any other in\r\nproportion, were never regularly collected in any of the Colonies. So\r\nthat the idea of an American revenue for one purpose or another had\r\nnever, at this time, been formed in American minds.\r\n\r\nOur writer goes on, \"She, (Great Britain,) thought it as reasonable\r\nthat the Colonies should bear a part of the national burdens, as that\r\nthey should share in the national benefit.\"\r\n\r\nUpon this subject Americans have a great deal to say. The national\r\ndebt before the last war, was near an hundred millions. Surely\r\nAmerica had no share in running into that debt. What is the reason\r\nthen that she should pay it? But a small part of the sixty\r\nmillions spent in the last war, was for her benefit. Did she not bear\r\nher full share of the burden of the last war in America? Did not the\r\nprovince pay twelve shillings in the pound in taxes for the support\r\nof it; and send a sixth or seventh part of her sons into actual\r\nservice? And at the conclusion of the war, was she not left half a\r\nmillion sterling in debt? Did not all the rest of New England exert\r\nitself in proportion? What is the reason that the Massachusetts has\r\npaid its debt, and the British minister in thirteen years of peace\r\nhas paid none of his? Much of it might have been paid in this time,\r\nhad not such extravagance and speculation prevailed, as ought to be\r\nan eternal warning to America, never to trust such a minister with\r\nher money. What is the reason that the great and necessary virtues\r\nof simplicity, frugality and economy cannot live in England, Scotland\r\nand Ireland, as well as America?\r\n\r\nWe have much more to say still. Great Britain has confined all our\r\ntrade to herself. We are willing she should, as far as it can be for\r\nthe good of the empire. But we say that we ought to be allowed as\r\ncredit, in the account of public burdens and expenses, so much paid\r\nin taxes, as we are obliged to sell our commodities to her cheaper\r\nthan we could get for them at foreign markets. The difference is\r\nreally a tax upon us, for the good of the empire. We are obliged to\r\ntake from Great Britain commodities, that we could purchase cheaper\r\nelsewhere. This difference is a tax upon us for the good of the\r\nempire. We submit to this cheerfully, but insist that we ought to\r\nhave credit for it, in the account of the expenses of the empire,\r\nbecause it is really a tax upon us. Another thing. I will venture\r\na bold assertion. Let Massachusettensis, or any other friend of\r\nthe minister, confute me. The three million Americans, by the tax\r\naforesaid, upon what they are obliged to export to Great Britain\r\nonly, what they are obliged to import from Great Britain only, and\r\nthe quantities of British manufactures which in these climates they\r\nare obliged to consume, more than the like number of people in any\r\npart of the three kingdoms, ultimately pay more of the taxes and\r\nduties that are apparently paid in Great Britain, than any three\r\nmillion subjects in the three kingdoms. All this may be computed\r\nand reduced to stubborn figures, by the minister, if he pleases.\r\nWe cannot do it. We have not the accounts, records, &c. Now let\r\nthis account be fairly stated, and I will engage for America,\r\nupon any penalty, that she will pay the overplus, if any, in her\r\nown constitutional way, provided it is to be applied for national\r\npurposes, as paying off the national debt, maintaining the fleet, &c.\r\nnot to the support of a standing army in time of peace, placemen,\r\npensioners, &c.\r\n\r\nBesides, every farthing of expense which has been incurred on\r\npretence of protecting, defending and securing America, since the\r\nlast war, has been worse than thrown away; it has been applied to do\r\nmischief. Keeping an army in America has been nothing but a public\r\nnuisance.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, we see that all the public money that is raised here,\r\nand have reason to believe all that will or can be raised, will be\r\napplied not for public purposes, national or provincial, but merely\r\nto corrupt the sons of America, and create a faction to destroy its\r\ninterest and happiness.\r\n\r\nThere are scarcely three sentences together, in all the voluminous\r\nproductions of this plausible writer, which do not convey some error\r\nin fact or principle, tinged with a colouring to make it pass for\r\ntruth. He says, \"the idea, that the stamps were a tax, not only\r\nexceeding our proportion, but beyond our utmost ability to pay,\r\nunited the Colonies generally in opposing it.\" That we thought it\r\nbeyond our proportion and ability is true, but it was not this\r\nthought which united the Colonies in opposing it. When he says that\r\nat first, we did not dream of denying the authority of parliament to\r\ntax us, much less to legislate for us, he discovers plainly either\r\na total inattention to the sentiments of America at that time, or a\r\ndisregard of what he affirms.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, the authority of parliament was never generally\r\nacknowledged in America. More than a century since, Massachusetts\r\nand Virginia, both protested against even the act of navigation\r\nand refused obedience, for this very reason, because they were\r\nnot represented in parliament and were therefore not bound; and\r\nafterwards confirmed it by their own provincial authority. And from\r\nthat time to this, the general sense of the Colonies has been, that\r\nthe authority of parliament was confined to the regulation of trade,\r\nand did not extend to taxation or internal legislation.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1764, your house of representatives sent home a petition\r\nto the king, against the plan of taxing them. Mr. Hutchinson, Oliver\r\nand their relations and connections were then in the legislature, and\r\nhad great influence there. It was by their influence that the two\r\nhouses were induced to wave the word rights, and an express denial of\r\nthe right of parliament to tax us, to the great grief and distress\r\nof the friends of liberty in both houses. Mr. Otis and Mr. Thatcher\r\nlaboured in the committee to obtain an express denial. Mr. Hutchinson\r\nexpressly said he agreed with them in opinion, that parliament had\r\nno right, but thought it ill policy to express this opinion in the\r\npetition. In truth, I will be bold to say, there was not any member\r\nof either house, who thought that parliament had such a right at\r\nthat time. The house of representatives, at that time, gave their\r\napprobation to Mr. Otis's rights of the Colonies, in which it was\r\nshewn to be inconsistent with the right of British subjects to be\r\ntaxed, but by their own representatives.\r\n\r\nIn 1765, our house expressly resolved against the right of\r\nparliament to tax us. The congress at New York resolved 3. \"That\r\nit is inseparably essential to the freedom of a people, and the\r\nundoubted right of Englishmen, that no tax be imposed on them, but\r\nwith their own consent given personally, or by their representatives.\r\n4. That the people of the Colonies are not, and from their local\r\ncircumstances cannot be represented in the house of commons of Great\r\nBritain. 5. That the only representatives of the people of the\r\nColonies, are the persons chosen therein by themselves; and that no\r\ntaxes ever have been or can be constitutionally imposed on them, but\r\nby their respective legislatures.\" Is it not a striking disregard to\r\ntruth in the artful Massachusettensis to say, that at first we did\r\nnot dream of denying the right of parliament to tax us? It was the\r\nprinciple that united the Colonies to oppose it, not the quantum of\r\nthe tax. Did not Dr. Franklin deny the right in 1754, in his remarks\r\nupon governor Shirley's scheme, and supposed that all America would\r\ndeny it? We had considered ourselves as connected with Great Britain,\r\nbut we never thought parliament the supreme legislature over us. We\r\nnever generally supposed it to have any authority over us, but from\r\nnecessity, and that necessity we thought confined to the regulation\r\nof trade, and to such matters as concerned all the colonies together.\r\nWe never allowed them any authority in our internal concerns.\r\n\r\nThis writer says, acts of parliament for regulating our internal\r\npolity were familiar. This I deny. So far otherwise, that the\r\nhatter's act was never regarded; the act to destroy the Land Bank\r\nScheme raised a greater ferment in this province, than the stamp-act\r\ndid, which was appeased only by passing province laws directly in\r\nopposition to it. The act against slitting mills, and tilt hammers,\r\nnever was executed here. As to the postage, it was so useful a\r\nregulation, so few persons paid it, and they found such a benefit\r\nby it, that little opposition was made to it. Yet every man who\r\nthought about it called it an usurpation. Duties for regulating\r\ntrade we paid, because we thought it just and necessary that they\r\nshould regulate the trade which their power protected. As for duties\r\nfor a revenue, none were ever laid by parliament for that purpose\r\nuntil 1764, when, and ever since, its authority to do it has been\r\nconstantly denied. Nor is this complaisant writer near the truth,\r\nwhen he says, \"We know that in all those acts of government, the good\r\nof the whole had been consulted.\" On the contrary, we know that the\r\nprivate interest of provincial governors and West India planters, had\r\nbeen consulted in the duties on foreign molasses, &c. and the private\r\ninterest of a few Portugal merchants, in obliging us to touch at\r\nFalmouth with fruit, &c. in opposition to the good of the whole, and\r\nin many other instances.\r\n\r\nThe resolves of the house of Burgesses of Virginia, upon the stamp\r\nact, did great honor to that province, and to the eminent patriot\r\nPatrick Henry, Esq. who composed them. But these resolves made no\r\nalteration in the opinion of the Colonies, concerning the right of\r\nparliament to make that act. They expressed the universal opinion of\r\nthe continent at that time, and the alacrity with which every other\r\nColony, and the congress at New York, adopted the same sentiment in\r\nsimilar resolves, proves the entire union of the Colonies in it, and\r\ntheir universal determination to avow and support it.\r\n\r\nWhat follows here, that it became so popular that his life was in\r\ndanger, who suggested the contrary, and that the press was open to\r\none side only, are direct misrepresentations and wicked calumnies.\r\n\r\nThen we are told, by this sincere writer, that when we obtained a\r\npartial repeal of the statute imposing duties on glass, paper, and\r\nteas, this was the lucky moment, when to have closed the dispute.\r\nWhat? With a Board of commissioners remaining the sole end of\r\nwhose creation was to form and conduct a revenue--with an act of\r\nparliament remaining, the professed design of which expressed in the\r\npreamble, was to raise a revenue, and appropriate it to the payment\r\nof governors' and judges' salaries, the duty remaining too upon an\r\narticle, which must raise a large sum, the consumption of which\r\nwould constantly increase? Was this a time to retreat? Let me ask\r\nthis sincere writer a simple question. Does he seriously believe\r\nthat the designs of imposing other taxes, and of new modelling our\r\ngovernments, would have been bid aside, by the ministry or by the\r\nservants of the crown here? Does he think that Mr. Bernard, Mr.\r\nHutchinson, the commissioners and others, would have been content\r\nthen to have desisted? If he really thinks so, he knows little of\r\nthe human heart, and still less of those gentlemen's hearts. It was\r\nat this very time that the salary was given to the governor, and an\r\norder soliciting for that to the judges.\r\n\r\nThen we are entertained with a great deal of ingenious talk about\r\nwhigs and tories, and at last are told that some of the whigs owed\r\nall their importance to popularity. And what then? Did not as many\r\nof the tories owe their importance to popularity?--And did not many\r\nmore owe all their importance to unpopularity? If it had not been\r\nfor their taking an active part on the side of the ministry, would\r\nnot some of the most conspicuous and eminent of them have been\r\nunimportant enough? Indeed, through the two last administrations to\r\ndespise and hate the people, and to be despised and hated by them\r\nwere the principal recommendations to the favours of government, and\r\nall the qualification that was required.\r\n\r\nThe tories, says he, were for closing the controversy. That is, they\r\nwere for contending no more, and it was equally true that they never\r\nwere for contending at all, but lying at mercy. It was the very end\r\nthey had aimed at from the beginning. They had now got the governor's\r\nsalary out of the revenue--a number of pensions and places, and\r\nthey knew they could at any time get the judges' salaries from the\r\nsame fountain, and they wanted to get the people reconciled and\r\nfamiliarised to this, before they went upon any new projects.\r\n\r\nThe whigs were averse to restoring government, they even refused\r\nto revive a temporary riot act, which expired about this time.\r\nGovernment had as much vigour then as ever, excepting only in those\r\ncases which affected this dispute. The riot act expired in 1770,\r\nimmediately after the massacre in King Street. It was not revived and\r\nnever will be in this Colony, nor will any one ever be made in any\r\nother, while a standing army is illegally posted here, to butcher\r\nthe people, whenever a governor, or a magistrate, who may be a tool,\r\nshall order it. \"Perhaps the whigs thought that mobs were a necessary\r\ningredient in their system of opposition.\" Whether they did or no, it\r\nis certain that mobs have been thought a necessary ingredient by the\r\ntories in their system of administration, mobs of the worst sort with\r\nred coats, fuzees and bayonets, and the lives and limbs of the whigs\r\nhave been in greater danger from these, than ever the tories were\r\nfrom others.\r\n\r\n\"The scheme of the whigs flattered the people with the idea of\r\nindependence; the tories' plan supposed a degree of subordination.\"\r\nThis is artful enough, as usual not to say jesuitical. The word\r\nindependence is one of those, which this writer uses, as he does\r\ntreason and rebellion, to impose upon the undistinguishing on both\r\nsides of the Atlantic. But let us take him to pieces. What does he\r\nmean by independence? Does he mean independent of the crown of Great\r\nBritain, and an independent republic in America, or a confederation\r\nof independent republics? No doubt he intended the undistinguishing\r\nshould understand him so. If he did; nothing can be more wicked,\r\nor a greater slander on the whigs; because he knows there is not a\r\nman in the province, among the whigs, nor ever was, who harbours\r\na wish of that sort. Does he mean that the people were flattered\r\nwith the idea of total independence on parliament? If he does,\r\nthis is equally malicious and injurious; because he knows that the\r\nequity and necessity of parliament's regulating trade has always\r\nbeen acknowledged, our determination to consent and submit to such\r\nregulations constantly expressed, and all the acts of trade in fact,\r\nto this very day, much more submitted to and strictly executed in\r\nthis province, than any other in America.\r\n\r\nThere is equal ambiguity in the words \"degree of subordination.\"\r\nThe whigs acknowledge a subordination to the king, in as strict and\r\nstrong a sense as the tories. The whigs acknowledge a voluntary\r\nsubordination to parliament, as far as the regulation of trade. What\r\ndegree of subordination then do the tories acknowledge? An absolute\r\ndependance upon parliament as their supreme legislative, in all cases\r\nwhatever, in their internal polity as well as taxation? This would\r\nbe too gross and would lose him all his readers; for there is nobody\r\nhere who will expose his understanding so much, as explicitly to\r\nadopt such a sentiment. Yet it is such an absolute dependance and\r\nsubmission, that these writers would persuade us to, or else there is\r\nno need of changing our sentiments and conduct. Why will not these\r\ngentlemen speak out, shew us plainly their opinion that the new\r\ngovernment, they have fabricated for this province, is better than\r\nthe old, and that all the other measures, we complain of, are for our\r\nand the public good, and exhort us directly to submit to them? The\r\nreason is, because they know they should lose their readers.\r\n\r\n\"The whigs were sensible that there was no oppression that could be\r\nseen or felt.\" The tories have so often said and wrote this to one\r\nanother, that I sometimes suspect they believe it to be true. But\r\nit is quite otherwise. The castle of the province was taken out of\r\ntheir hand and garrisoned by regular soldiers: this they could see,\r\nand they thought it indicated an hostile intention and disposition\r\ntowards them. They continually paid their money to collectors of\r\nduties: this they could both see and feel. An host of placemen, whose\r\nwhole business it was to collect a revenue, were continually rolling\r\nbefore them in their chariots. These they saw. Their governor was no\r\nlonger paid by themselves, according to their charter, but out of the\r\nnew revenue, in order to render their assemblies useless and indeed\r\ncontemptible. The judges' salaries were threatened every day to be\r\npaid in the same unconstitutional manner. The dullest eye-sight could\r\nnot but see to what all this tended, viz.; to prepare the way for\r\ngreater innovations and oppressions. They knew a minister would never\r\nspend his money in this way, if he had not some end to answer by it.\r\nAnother thing they both saw and felt. Every man, of every character,\r\nwho by voting, writing, speaking, or otherwise, had favoured the\r\nstamp act, the tea act, and every other measure of a minister or\r\ngovernor, who they knew was aiming at the destruction of their form\r\nof government, and introducing parliamentary taxation, was uniformly,\r\nin some department or other, promoted to some place of honour or\r\nprofit for ten years together: and, on the other hand, every man who\r\nfavoured the people in their opposition to those innovations, was\r\ndepressed, degraded and persecuted, as far as it was in the power of\r\nthe government to do it.\r\n\r\nThis they considered as a systematical means of encouraging every\r\nman of abilities to espouse the cause of parliamentary taxation, and\r\nthe plan of destroying their charter privilege, and to discourage\r\nall from exerting themselves, in opposition to them. This they\r\nthought a plan to enslave them, for they uniformly think that the\r\ndestruction of their charter, making the council and judges wholly\r\ndependant on the crown, and the people subject to the unlimited power\r\nof parliament, as their supreme legislative, is slavery. They were\r\ncertainly rightly told, then, that the ministry and their governors\r\ntogether had formed a design to enslave them; and that when once this\r\nwas done, they had the highest reason to expect window taxes, hearth\r\ntaxes, land taxes and all others: and that these were only paving the\r\nway for reducing the country to lordships. Were the people mistaken\r\nin these suspicions? Is it not now certain that governor Bernard\r\nin 1764, had formed a design of this sort? Read his principles of\r\npolity--And that lieutenant governor Oliver as late as 1768 or 9,\r\ninforced the same plan? Read his letters.\r\n\r\nNow if Massachusettensis will be ingenuous, avow this design, shew\r\nthe people its utility, and that it ought to be done by parliament,\r\nhe will act the part of an honest man. But to insinuate that there\r\nwas no such plan, when he knows there was, is acting the part of one\r\nof the junto.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the people of this country in general, and of this\r\nprovince in special, have an hereditary apprehension of and aversion\r\nto lordships, temporal and spiritual. Their ancestors fled to this\r\nwilderness to avoid them--they suffered sufficiently under them in\r\nEngland. And there are few of the present generation, who have not\r\nbeen warned of the danger of them by their fathers or grandfathers,\r\nand injoined to oppose them. And neither Bernard nor Oliver ever\r\ndared to avow, before them, the designs which they had certainly\r\nformed to introduce them. Nor does Massachusettensis dare to avow\r\nhis opinion in their favour. I do not mean that such avowal would\r\nexpose their persons to danger, but their characters and writings to\r\nuniversal contempt.\r\n\r\nWhen you were told that the people of England were depraved, the\r\nparliament venal, and the ministry corrupt, were you not told most\r\nmelancholy truths? Will Massachusettensis deny any of them? Does\r\nnot every man, who comes from England, whig or tory, tell you the\r\nsame thing? Do they make any secret of it, or use any delicacy about\r\nit? Do they not most of them avow that corruption is so established\r\nthere, as to be incurable, and a necessary instrument of government?\r\nIs not the British constitution arrived nearly to that point, where\r\nthe Roman republic was, when Jugurtha left it, and pronounced it a\r\nvenal city ripe for destruction, if it can only find a purchaser? If\r\nMassachusettensis can prove that it is not, he will remove from my\r\nmind, one of the heaviest loads which lies upon it.\r\n\r\nWho has censured the tories for remissness, I know not. Whoever\r\nit was, he did them great injustice. Every one that I know of\r\nthat character has been through the whole tempestuous period, as\r\nindefatigable as human nature will admit, going about seeking whom\r\nhe might devour, making use of art, flattery, terror, temptation and\r\nallurements in every shape, in which human wit could dress it up, in\r\npublic and private. But all to no purpose. The people have grown more\r\nand more weary of them every day, until now the land mourns under\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nMassachusettensis is then seized with a violent fit of anger at the\r\nclergy. It is curious to observe the conduct of the tories towards\r\nthis sacred body. If a clergyman preaches against the principles of\r\nthe revolution, and tells the people that upon pain of damnation,\r\nthey must submit to an established government, of whatever character\r\nthe tories cry him up, as an excellent man, and a wonderful preacher,\r\ninvite him to their tables, procure him missions from the society,\r\nand chaplainships to the navy, and flatter him with the hopes of lawn\r\nsleeves. But if a clergyman preaches christianity, and tells the\r\nmagistrates that they were not distinguished from their brethren, for\r\ntheir private emolument, but for the good of the people; that the\r\npeople are bound in conscience to obey a good government, but are\r\nnot bound to submit to one, that aims at destroying all the ends of\r\ngovernment--Oh Sedition! Treason!\r\n\r\nThe clergy in all ages and countries, and in this in particular,\r\nare disposed enough to be on the side of government, as long as\r\nit is tolerable. If they have not been generally, in the late\r\nadministrations, on that side, it is a demonstration that the late\r\nadministration has been universally odious.\r\n\r\nThe clergy of this province are a virtuous, sensible and learned set\r\nof men; and they do not take their sermons from newspapers, but the\r\nbible; unless it be a few, who preach passive obedience. These are\r\nnot generally curious enough to read Hobbs.\r\n\r\nIt is the duty of the clergy to accommodate their discourses to\r\nthe times, to preach against such sins, as are most prevalent,\r\nand recommend such virtues, as are most wanted. For example; if\r\nexorbitant ambition, and venality are predominant, ought they not to\r\nwarn their hearers against their [Errata: these] vices? If public\r\nspirit is much wanted, should they not inculcate this great virtue?\r\nIf the rights and duties of christian magistrates and subjects are\r\ndisputed, should they not explain them, shew their nature, ends,\r\nlimitations and restrictions, how much soever it may move the gall of\r\nMassachusettensis?\r\n\r\nLet me put a supposition:--Justice is a great christian, as well\r\nas moral duty and virtue, which the clergy ought to inculcate and\r\nexplain. Suppose a great man of a parish should for seven years\r\ntogether receive 600 sterling a year, for discharging the duties of\r\nan important office; but during the whole time, should never do one\r\nact or take one step about it. Would not this be great injustice to\r\nthe public? And ought not the parson of that parish to cry aloud\r\nand spare not, and shew such a bold transgressor his sin? shew that\r\njustice was due to the public as well as to an individual? and that\r\ncheating the public of four thousand two hundred pounds sterling,\r\nis at least as great a sin, as taking a chicken from a private hen\r\nroost, or perhaps a watch from a fob?\r\n\r\nThen we are told that newspapers and preachers have excited outrages\r\ndisgraceful to humanity. Upon this subject I will venture to say,\r\nthat there have been outrages in this province, which I neither\r\njustify, excuse or extenuate; but these were not excited, that I know\r\nof, by newspapers or sermons: that however, if we run through the\r\nlast ten years, and consider all the tumults and outrages that have\r\nhappened, and at the same time recollect the insults, provocations\r\nand oppressions which this people have endured; we shall find the\r\ntwo characteristics of this people, religion and humanity, strongly\r\nmarked on all their proceedings. Not a life, nor, that I have ever\r\nheard, a single limb has been lost through the whole. I will take\r\nupon me to say, there is not another province on this continent,\r\nnor in his majesty's dominions, where the people, under the same\r\nindignities, would not have gone greater lengths. Consider the\r\ntumults in the three kingdoms, consider the tumults in ancient Rome,\r\nin the most virtuous of her periods, and compare them with ours. It\r\nis a saying of Machiavel, which no wise man ever contradicted, which\r\nhas been literally verified in this province; that \"while the mass of\r\nthe people is not corrupted, tumults do no hurt.\" By which he means,\r\nthat they leave no lasting ill effects behind.\r\n\r\nBut let us consider the outrages committed by the tories. Half\r\na dozen men shot dead in an instant, in King Street, frequent\r\nresistance and affronts to civil officers and magistrates, officers,\r\nwatchmen, citizens, cut and mangle in a most inhuman manner. Not\r\nto mention the shootings for desertion, and the frequent cruel\r\nwhippings for other faults, cutting and mangling men's bodies before\r\nthe eyes of citizens; spectacles which ought never to be introduced\r\ninto populous places. The worst sort of tumults and outrages, ever\r\ncommitted in this province, were excited by the tories. But more of\r\nthis hereafter.\r\n\r\nWe are then told that the whigs erected a provincial democracy,\r\nor republic, in the province. I wish Massachusettensis knew what\r\na democracy, or republic is. But this subject must be considered\r\nanother time.\r\n\r\nNOVANGLUS.\r\n\r\n     Messieurs Printers. Instead of _Cawings_ of Cormorants, in\r\n     a former paper, you have printed _Cooings_, too dove-like a\r\n     word for the birds intended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESSED\r\n\r\n_To the Inhabitants of the Colony of Massachusetts Bay_,\r\n\r\nFebruary 20, 1775.\r\n\r\n\r\nMY FRIENDS,\r\n\r\nWe are at length arrived at the paper, on which I made a few\r\nstrictures, some weeks ago: these I shall not repeat, but proceed to\r\nconsider the other part of it.\r\n\r\nWe are told, \"It is an universal truth, that he that would excite\r\na rebellion, is at heart, as great a tyrant, as ever wielded the\r\niron rod of oppression.\" Be it so. We are not exciting a rebellion.\r\nOpposition, nay open, avowed resistance by arms, against usurpation\r\nand lawless violence, is not rebellion by the law of God, or the\r\nland. Resistance to lawful authority makes rebellion. Hampden,\r\nRussell, Sydney, Somers, Holt, Tillotson, Burnet, Hoadly, &c. were\r\nno tyrants nor rebels, although some of them were in arms, and the\r\nothers undoubtedly excited resistance, against the tories. Do not\r\nbeg the question, Mr. Massachusettensis, and then give yourself airs\r\nof triumph. Remember the frank Veteran acknowledges, that \"the word\r\nrebel is a convertible term.\"\r\n\r\nThis writer next attempts to trace the spirit of opposition through\r\nthe general court, and the courts of common law. \"It was the policy\r\nof the whigs, to have their questions, upon high matters, determined\r\nby yea and nay votes, which were published in the gazettes.\"\r\nAnd ought not great questions to be so determined? In many other\r\nassemblies, New York particularly, they always are. What better can\r\nbe devised to discover the true sense of the people? It is extremely\r\nprovoking to courtiers, that they cannot vote, as the cabinet\r\ndirect them, against their consciences, the known sense of their\r\nconstituents, and the obvious good of the community, without being\r\ndetected. Generally, perhaps universally, no unpopular measure in\r\na free government, particularly the English, ought ever to pass.\r\nWhy have the people a share in the legislature, but to prevent\r\nsuch measures from passing, I mean such as are disapproved by the\r\npeople at large? But did not these yea and nay votes expose the\r\nwhigs, as well as tories, to the impartial judgment of the public?\r\nIf the votes of the former were given for measures injurious to the\r\ncommunity, had not the latter an equal opportunity of improving\r\nthem to the disadvantage of their adversaries in the next election?\r\nBesides, were not those few persons in the house, who generally\r\nvoted for unpopular measures, near the governor, in possession of\r\nhis confidence? Had they not the absolute disposal in their towns\r\nand counties of the favour of government? Were not all the judges,\r\njustices, sheriffs, coroners and military officers in their towns,\r\nmade upon their recommendation? Did not this give them a prodigious\r\nweight and influence? Had the whigs any such advantage? And does not\r\nthe influence of these yea and nay votes, consequently prove to a\r\ndemonstration, the unanimity of the people, against the measures of\r\nthe court?\r\n\r\nAs to what is said of \"severe strictures, illiberal invectives,\r\nabuse and scurrility, upon the dissentients,\" there was quite as\r\nmuch of all these published against the leading whigs. In truth,\r\nthe strictures, &c. against the tories were generally nothing more,\r\nthan hints at the particular place or office, which was known to be\r\nthe temptation to vote against the country. That \"the dissentient\r\nwas in danger of losing his bread and involving his family in ruin,\"\r\nis equally injurious. Not an instance can be produced of a member\r\nlosing his bread, or injuring his business, by voting for unpopular\r\nmeasures. On the contrary such voters never failed to obtain some\r\nlucrative employment, title, or honorary office, as a reward from the\r\ncourt.\r\n\r\nIf \"one set of members in committee had always prepared the\r\nresolves,\" &c. which they did not; what would this prove, but that\r\nthis set was thought by the house the fittest for the purpose? Can it\r\never be otherwise? Will any popular assembly choose its worst members\r\nfor the best services? Will an assembly of patriots choose courtiers\r\nto prepare votes against the court? No resolves against the claims\r\nof parliament or administration, or the measures of the governor,\r\n(excepting those against the stamp act, and perhaps the answers to\r\ngovernor Hutchinson's speeches upon the supremacy of parliament) ever\r\npassed through the house, without meeting an obstacle. The governor\r\nhad to the last hour of the house's existence, always some seekers\r\nand expectants in the house, who never failed to oppose, and offer\r\nthe best arguments they could; and were always patiently heard:\r\nthat the lips of the dissentients were sealed up; that they sat in\r\nsilence, and beheld with regret, measures they dared not oppose, are\r\ngroundless suggestions and gross reflections upon the honour and\r\ncourage of those members. The debates of this house were public, and\r\nevery man, who has attended the gallery, knows there never was more\r\nfreedom of debate in any assembly.\r\n\r\nMassachusettensis, in the next place, conducts us to the agent, and\r\ntell us \"there can not be a provincial agent without an appointment\r\nby the three branches of the assembly. The whigs soon found that they\r\ncould not have such services rendered them, from a provincial agent\r\nas would answer their purposes.\"\r\n\r\nThe treatment this province has received, respecting the agency,\r\nsince Mr. Hutchinson's administration commenced, is a flagrant\r\nexample of injustice. There is no law, which requires the province to\r\nmaintain any agent in England; much less is there any reason, which\r\nnecessarily requires, that the three branches should join in the\r\nappointment. In ordinary times, indeed, when a harmony prevails among\r\nthe branches, it is well enough to have an agent constituted by all.\r\nBut in times when the foundations of the constitution are disputed,\r\nand certainly attacked by one branch or the other, to pretend that\r\nthe house ought to join the governor in the choice, is a palpable\r\nabsurdity. It is equivalent to saying that the people shall have no\r\nagent at all; that all communication shall be cut off; and that there\r\nshall be no channel, through which complaints and petitions may be\r\nconveyed to the royal ear; because a governor will not concur in an\r\nagent whose sentiments are not like his; nor will an agent of the\r\ngovernor's appointment be likely to urge accusations against them,\r\nwith any diligence or zeal, if the people have occasion to complain\r\nagainst him.\r\n\r\nEvery private citizen, much more, every representative body, has an\r\nundoubted right to petition the king, to convey such petition by\r\nan agent, and to pay him for his service. Mr. Bernard, to do him\r\njustice, had so much regard to these principles, as to consent to the\r\npayment of the people's agents, while he staid. But Mr. Hutchinson\r\nwas scarcely seated in the chair, as lieutenant governor, before\r\nwe had intelligence from England, that my lord Hillsborough told\r\nDr. Franklin, he had received a letter from governor Hutchinson\r\nagainst consenting to the salary of the agent. Such an instruction\r\nwas accordingly soon sent, and no agent for the board or house,\r\nhas received a farthing for services, since that time, though Dr.\r\nFranklin and Mr. Bollan have taken much pains, and one of them\r\nexpended considerable sums of money. There is a meanness in this play\r\nthat would disgrace a gambler; a manifest fear that the truth should\r\nbe known to the sovereign or the people. Many persons have thought\r\nthat the province ought to have dismissed all agents from that time,\r\nas useless and nugatory; this behaviour amounting to a declaration,\r\nthat we had no chance or hopes of justice from a minister.\r\n\r\nBut this province, at least as meritorious as any, has been long\r\naccustomed to indignities and injustice, and to bear both with\r\nunparalleled patience. Others, have pursued the same method before\r\nand since; but we have never heard that their agents are unpaid. They\r\nwould scarcely have borne it with so much resignation.\r\n\r\nIt is great assurance to blame the house for this, which was both\r\ntheir right and duty; but a stain in the character of his patron,\r\nwhich will not be soon worn out. Indeed this passage seems to have\r\nbeen brought in, chiefly for the sake of a stroke or two, addressed\r\nto the lowest and meanest of the people; I mean the insinuation that\r\nthe two agents doubled the _expence_, which is as groundless as it\r\nis contracted; and that the ostensible agent for the province was\r\nonly agent for a few individuals, that had got the art of wielding\r\nthe house; and that several hundred sterling a year, for attending\r\nlevees and writing letters, were worth preserving. We, my friends,\r\nknow that no members have the art of wielding us or our house, but\r\nby concurring in our principles, and assisting us in our designs.\r\nNumbers in both houses have turned about and expected to wield us\r\nround with them; but they have been disappointed, and ever will be.\r\nSuch apostates have never yet failed of our utter contempt, whatever\r\ntitles, places or pensions they might obtain.\r\n\r\nThe agent has never echoed back, or transmitted to America, any\r\nsentiments, which he did not give in substance to governor Shirley,\r\ntwenty years ago; and therefore this insinuation is but another\r\nslander. The remainder of what is said of the agency is levelled at\r\nDr. Franklin, and is but a dull appendix to Wedderburn's ribaldry,\r\nhaving all his malice without any of his wit or spirit. Nero murdered\r\nSeneca, that he might pull up virtue by the roots; and the same\r\nmaxim governs the scribblers and speechifiers, on the side of the\r\nminister. It is sufficient to discover that any man has abilities and\r\nintegrity, a love of virtue and liberty; he must be run down at all\r\nevents. Witness Pitt and Franklin and too many others.\r\n\r\nMy design in pursuing this malicious slanderer, concealed as he is,\r\nunder so soft and oily an appearance, through all the doublings\r\nof his tedious course, is to vindicate this Colony from his base\r\naspersions; that strangers now among us and the impartial public\r\nmay see the wicked arts, which are still employed against us. After\r\nthe vilest abuse upon the agent of the province and the house, that\r\nappointed him, we are brought to his majesty's council, and are told\r\nthat the \"whigs reminded them of their mortality--If any one opposed\r\nthe violent measures, he lost his election next May. Half the whole\r\nnumber, mostly men of the first families, note, abilities, attached\r\nto their native country, wealthy and independent, were tumbled from\r\ntheir seats in disgrace. Thus the board lost its weight, and the\r\npolitical balance was destroyed.\"\r\n\r\nIt is impossible for any man acquainted with this subject to\r\nread this zealous rant, without smiling, until he attends to the\r\nwickedness of it, which will provoke his utmost indignation. Let us\r\nhowever consider it soberly.\r\n\r\nFrom the date of our charter, to the time of the stamp act, and\r\nindeed since that time (notwithstanding the misrepresentations of\r\nour charter constitution, as too popular and republican) the council\r\nof this province have been generally on the side of the governor and\r\nthe prerogative. For the truth of this, I appeal to our whole history\r\nand experience. The art and power of governors, and especially the\r\nnegative, have been a stronger motive on the one hand, than the\r\nannual election of the two houses on the other. In disputes between\r\nthe governor and the house, the council have generally adhered to\r\nthe former, and in many cases have complied with his humour, when\r\nscarcely any council by mandamus, upon this continent, would have\r\ndone it.\r\n\r\nBut in the time of the stamp act, it was found productive of many\r\nmischiefs and dangers, to have officers of the crown, who were\r\ndependant on the ministry, and judges of the superior court, whose\r\noffices were thought incompatible with a voice in the legislature,\r\nmembers of council.\r\n\r\nIn May 1765, Lt. Gov. Hutchinson, Sec. Oliver, and Mr. Belcher were\r\nofficers of the crown, the judges of the superior court, and some\r\nother gentlemen, who held commissions under the governor, were\r\nmembers of council. Mr. Hutchinson was chief justice and a judge of\r\nprobate for the first county, as well as lieutenant governor, and a\r\ncounsellor; too many offices for the greatest and best man in the\r\nworld to hold, too much business for any man to do; besides, that\r\nthese offices were frequently clashing and interfering with each\r\nother. Two other justices of the superior court were counsellors,\r\nand nearly and closely connected with him by family alliances. One\r\nother justice was judge of admiralty during pleasure. Such a jumble\r\nof offices never got together before in any English government. It\r\nwas found in short, that the famous triumvirate, Bernard, Hutchinson\r\nand Oliver, the ever memorable, secret, confidential letter writers,\r\nwhom I call the junto, had by degrees, and before the people were\r\naware of it, erected a tyranny in the province. Bernard had all\r\nthe executive, and a negative on the legislative; Hutchinson and\r\nOliver, by their popular arts and secret intrigues, had elevated\r\nto the board, such a collection of crown officers, and their own\r\nrelations, as to have too much influence there; and they had three\r\nof a family on the superior bench, which is the supreme tribunal in\r\nall causes civil and criminal, vested with all the powers of the\r\nking's bench, common pleas and exchequer, which gave them power over\r\nevery act of this court. This junto therefore had the legislative and\r\nexecutive in their controul, and more natural influence over the\r\njudicial, than is ever to be trusted to any set of men in the world.\r\nThe public accordingly found all these springs and wheels in the\r\nconstitution set in motion to promote submission to the stamp act,\r\nand to discountenance resistance to it; and they thought they had a\r\nviolent presumption, that they would forever be employed to encourage\r\na compliance with all ministerial measures and parliamentary claims,\r\nof whatever character they might be.\r\n\r\nThe designs of the junto, however, were concealed as carefully as\r\npossible. Most persons were jealous; few were certain. When the\r\nassembly met in May, 1766, after the stamp act was repealed, the\r\nwhigs flattered themselves with hopes of peace and liberty for\r\nthe future. Mr. Otis, whose abilities and integrity, whose great\r\nexertions, and most exemplary sacrifices of his private interest to\r\nthe public service, had entitled him to all the promotion, which\r\nthe people could bestow, was chosen speaker of the house. Bernard\r\nnegatived the choice. It can scarcely be conceived by a stranger,\r\nwhat an alarm this manoeuvre gave to the public. It was thought\r\nequivalent to a declaration, that although the people had been so\r\nsuccessful as to obtain a repeal of the stamp act, yet they must not\r\nhope to be quiet long, for parliament, by the declaratory act, had\r\nasserted its supreme authority, and new taxations and regulations\r\nshould be made, if the junto could obtain them: and every man who\r\nshould dare to oppose such projects, let his powers, or virtues, his\r\nfamily or fortune be what they would, should be surely cut off from\r\nall hopes of advancement. The electors thought it high time to be\r\nupon their guard. All the foregoing reasons and motives prevailed\r\nwith the electors; and the crown officers and justices of the supreme\r\ncourt, were left out of council in the new choice. Those who were\r\nelected in their places were all negatived by Bernard, which was\r\nconsidered as a fresh proof, that the junto still persevered in their\r\ndesigns of obtaining a revenue, to divide among themselves.\r\n\r\nThe gentlemen elected anew, were of equal fortune and integrity, at\r\nleast, and not much inferior in abilities to those left out, and\r\nindeed, in point of fortune, family, note or abilities, the councils\r\nwhich have been chosen from that time to this, taken on an average,\r\nhave been very little inferior, if any, to those chosen before. Let\r\nMassachusettensis descend if he will, to every particular gentleman\r\nby name through the whole period, and I will make out my assertion.\r\n\r\nEvery impartial person will not only think these reasons a full\r\nvindication of the conduct of the two houses, but that it was their\r\nindispensable duty to their country, to act the part they did; and\r\nthe course of time, which has developed the dark intrigues of the\r\njunto, before and since, has confirmed the rectitude and necessity\r\nof the measure. Had Bernard's principles of polity been published\r\nand known at that time, no member of the house, who should have\r\nvoted for any of the persons then left out, if it was known to his\r\nconstituents, would ever have obtained another election.\r\n\r\nBy the next step we rise to the chair. \"With the board, the chair\r\nfell likewise,\" he says. But what a slander is this? Neither fell;\r\nboth remained in as much vigour as ever. The junto it is true, and\r\nsome other gentlemen who were not in their secret, but however had\r\nbeen misled to concur in their measures, were left out of council.\r\nBut the board had as much authority as ever. The board of 1766\r\ncould not have influenced the people to acknowledge the supreme\r\nuncontroulable authority of parliament, nor could that of 1765, have\r\ndone it. So that by the chair, and the boards falling, he means\r\nno more, if his meaning has any truth in it, than that the junto\r\nfell; the designs of taxing the Colonies fell, and the schemes\r\nfor destroying all the charters on the continent and for erecting\r\nlordships fell. These, it must be acknowleged, fell very low indeed,\r\nin the esteem of the people, and the two houses.\r\n\r\n\"The governor,\" says our wily writer, \"could do little or nothing\r\nwithout the council, by the charter.\" \"If he called upon a military\r\nofficer to raise the militia, he was answered they were there\r\nalready,\" &c. The council, by the charter, had nothing to do with\r\nthe militia. The governor alone had all authority over them. The\r\ncouncil therefore are not to blame for their conduct. If the militia\r\nrefused obedience to the captain general, or his subordinate officer,\r\nwhen commanded to assist in carrying into execution the stamp act,\r\nor in dispersing those who were opposing it, does not this prove\r\nthe universal sense and resolution of the people not to submit to\r\nit? Did not a regular army do more to James the second? If those,\r\nover whom the governor had the most absolute authority and decisive\r\ninfluence, refused obedience, does not this show how deeply rooted\r\nin all men's minds was the abhorrence of that unconstitutional\r\npower which was usurping over them? \"If he called upon the council\r\nfor their assistance, they must first inquire into the cause.\" An\r\nunpardonable crime, no doubt! But is it the duty of a middle branch\r\nof legislature, to do as the first shall command them, implicitly,\r\nor to judge for themselves? Is it the duty of a privy council, to\r\nunderstand the subject before they give advice, or only to lend their\r\nnames to any edict, in order to make it less unpopular? It would\r\nbe a shame to answer such observations as these, if it was not for\r\ntheir wickedness. Our council, all along however did as much as any\r\ncouncil could have done. Was the mandamus council at New York able to\r\ndo more, to influence the people to a submission to the stamp act?\r\nWas the chair, the board, the septennial house, with the assistance\r\nof general Gage and his troops, able to do more, in that city, than\r\nour branches did in this province? Not one iota. Nor could Bernard,\r\nhis council, and house, if they had been unanimous, have induced\r\nsubmission. The people would have spurned them all, for they are not\r\nto be wheedled out of their liberties by their own representatives,\r\nanymore than by strangers. \"If he wrote to government at home to\r\nstrengthen his hands, some officious person procured and sent back\r\nhis letters.\" At last it seems to be acknowledged, that the governor\r\ndid write for a military force, to strengthen government. For what?\r\nto enable it to enforce stamp acts, tea acts, and other internal\r\nregulations, the authority of which the people were determined never\r\nto acknowledge.\r\n\r\nBut what a pity it was, that these worthy gentlemen could not be\r\nallowed, from the dearest affection to their native country, to which\r\nthey had every possible attachment, to go on in profound confidential\r\nsecrecy, procuring troops to cut our throats, acts of parliament\r\nto drain our purses, destroy our charters and assemblies, getting\r\nestates and dignities for themselves and their own families, and all\r\nthe while most devoutly professing to be friends to our charter,\r\nenemies to parliamentary taxation, and to all pensions, without being\r\ndetected? How happy! if they could have annihilated all our charters,\r\nand yet have been beloved, nay deified by the people, as friends and\r\nadvocates for their charters? What masterly politicians! to have\r\nmade themselves nobles for life, and yet have been thought very\r\nsorry, that the two houses were denied the privilege of choosing the\r\ncouncil? How sagacious, to get large pensions for themselves, and yet\r\nbe thought to mourn, that pensions and venality were introduced into\r\nthe country? How sweet and pleasant! to have been the most popular\r\nmen in the community, for being staunch and zealous dissenters, true\r\nblue Calvinists, and able advocates for public virtue and popular\r\ngovernment, after they had introduced an American Episcopate,\r\nuniversal corruption among the leading men, and deprived the people\r\nof all share in their supreme legislative council? I mention an\r\nEpiscopate, for although I do not know that governors Hutchinson and\r\nOliver ever directly solicited for bishops, yet they must have seen,\r\nthat these would have been one effect, very soon, of establishing the\r\nunlimited authority of parliament!\r\n\r\nI agree with this writer, that it was not the persons of Bernard,\r\nHutchinson or Oliver, that made them obnoxious; but their principles\r\nand practices. And I will agree, that if Chatham, Campden and St.\r\nAsaph, (I beg pardon for introducing these reverend names into\r\nsuch company, and for making a supposition which is absurd) had\r\nbeen here, and prosecuted such schemes, they would have met with\r\ncontempt and execration from this people. But when he says, \"that\r\nhad the intimations in those letters been attended to, we had now\r\nbeen as happy a people as good government could make us,\" it is\r\ntoo gross to make us angry. We can do nothing but smile. Have not\r\nthese intimations been attended to? Have not fleets and armies\r\nbeen sent here, whenever they requested? Have not governors',\r\nlieutenant governors', secretaries', judges', attorney generals',\r\nand solicitor generals' salaries been paid out of the revenue as they\r\nsolicited? Have not taxes been laid, and continued? Have not English\r\nliberties been abridged as Hutchinson desired? Have not \"penalties\r\nof another kind\" been inflicted, as he desired? Has not our charter\r\nbeen destroyed, and the council put into the king's hands, as\r\nBernard requested? In short, almost all the wild mock pranks of\r\nthis desperate triumvirate have been attended to and adopted, and\r\nwe are now as miserable as tyranny can well make us. That Bernard\r\ncame here with the affections of New Jersey, I never heard nor read,\r\nbut in this writer. His abilities were considerable, or he could\r\nnot have done such extensive mischief. His true British honesty and\r\npunctuality will be acknowledged by none, but such as owe all their\r\nimportance to flattering him.\r\n\r\nThat Hutchinson was amiable and exemplary, in some respects, and very\r\nunamiable and unexemplary, in others, is a certain truth; otherwise\r\nhe never would have retained so much popularity on one hand, nor made\r\nso pernicious a use of it on the other. His behavior, in several\r\nimportant departments, was with ability and integrity, in cases which\r\ndid not effect his political system, but he bent all his offices to\r\nthat. Had he continued stedfast to those principles in religion and\r\ngovernment, which in his former life he professed, and which alone\r\nhad procured him the confidence of the people and all his importance,\r\nhe would have lived and died, respected and beloved, and have done\r\nhonor to his native country. But by renouncing these principles and\r\nthat conduct, which had made him and all his ancestors respectable,\r\nhis character is now considered by all America, and the best part of\r\nthe three kingdoms, notwithstanding the countenance he receives from\r\nthe ministry, as a reproach to the province that gave him birth, as\r\na man who by all his actions aimed at making himself great, at the\r\nexpense of the liberties of his native country. This gentleman was\r\nopen to flattery, in so remarkable a degree, that any man who would\r\nflatter him was sure of his friendship, and every one who would not,\r\nwas sure of his enmity. He was credulous, in a rediculous degree,\r\nof every thing that favoured his own plans, and equally incredulous\r\nof every thing which made against them. His natural abilities which\r\nhave been greatly exaggerated by persons whom he had advanced to\r\npower, were far from being of the first rate. His industry was\r\nprodigious. His knowledge lay chiefly in the laws and politics and\r\nhistory of this province, in which he had a long experience. Yet\r\nwith all his advantages, he never was master of the true character\r\nof his native country, not even of New England and the Massachusetts\r\nBay. Through the whole troublesome period since the last war, he\r\nmanifestly mistook the temper, principles, and opinions of this\r\npeople. He had resolved upon a system, and never could or would see\r\nthe impracticability of it.\r\n\r\nIt is very true that all his abilities, virtues, interests and\r\nconnections, were insufficient; but for what? To prevail on the\r\npeople to acquiesce in the mighty claim of parliamentary authority.\r\nThe constitution was not gone. The suggestion, that it was, is a\r\nvile slander. It had as much vigour as ever, and even the governor\r\nhad as much power as ever, excepting in cases which affected that\r\nclaim. \"The spirit\" says this writer \"was truly republican.\" It\r\nwas not so in any one case whatever; any further than the spirit\r\nof the British constitution is republican. Even in the grand\r\nfundamental dispute, the people arranged themselves under their\r\nhouse of representatives and council, with as much order as ever,\r\nand conducted their opposition as much by the constitution as ever.\r\nIt is true their constitution was employed against the measures of\r\nthe junto, which created their enmity to it. However I have not such\r\nan horror of republican spirit, which is a spirit of true virtue,\r\nand honest independence; I do not mean on the king, but on men in\r\npower. This spirit is so far from being incompatible with the British\r\nconstitution, that it is the greatest glory of it, and the nation has\r\nalways been most prosperous, when it has most prevailed and been most\r\nencouraged by the crown. I wish it increased in every part of the\r\nworld, especially in America; and I think the measures, the tories\r\nare now pursuing, will increase it to a degree that will ensure us,\r\nin the end, redress of grievances and an happy reconciliation with\r\nGreat Britain.\r\n\r\n\"Governor Hutchinson strove to convince us, by the principles of\r\ngovernment, our charters and acknowledgments, that our claims were\r\ninconsistent with the subordination due to Great Britain,\" &c. says\r\nthis writer.\r\n\r\nSuffer me to introduce here, a little history. In 1764, when\r\nthe system of taxing and new modelling the Colonies was first\r\napprehended, lieutenant governor Hutchinson's friends struggled in\r\nseveral successive sessions of the general court, to get him chosen\r\nagent for the province at the court of Great Britain. At this time\r\nhe declared freely, _that he was of the same sentiment with the\r\npeople, that parliament had no right to tax them; but differed from\r\nthe country party, only in his opinion of the policy of denying that\r\nright, in their petitions_, &c. I would not injure him; I was told\r\nthis by three gentlemen who were of the committee of both houses,\r\nto prepare that petition, that he made this declaration explicitly\r\nbefore that committee. I have been told by other gentlemen that he\r\nmade the same declaration to them. It is possible that he might make\r\nuse of expressions studied for the purpose, which would not strictly\r\nbear this construction. But it is certain that they understood him\r\nso, and that this was the general opinion of his sentiments until he\r\ncame to the chair.\r\n\r\nThe country party saw, that this aspiring genius aimed at keeping\r\nfair with the ministry, by supporting their measures, and with the\r\npeople, by pretending to be of our principles, and between both to\r\ntrim himself up to the chair. The only reason why he did not obtain\r\nan election at one time, and was excused from the service at another,\r\nafter he had been chosen by a small majority, was because the members\r\nknew he would not openly deny the right, and assure his majesty, the\r\nparliament, and ministry, that the people never would submit to it.\r\nFor the same reason he was left out of council. But he continued to\r\ncultivate his popularity, and to maintain a general opinion among the\r\npeople, that he denied the right in his private judgment, and this\r\nidea preserved most of those who continued their esteem for him.\r\n\r\nBut upon Bernard's removal, and his taking the chair as lieutenant\r\ngovernor, he had no farther expectations from the people nor\r\ncomplaisance for their opinions. In one of his first speeches he took\r\ncare to advance the supreme authority of parliament. This astonished\r\nmany of his friends. They were heard to say, we have been deceived.\r\nWe thought he had been abused, but we now find what has been said of\r\nhim is true. He is determined to join in the designs against this\r\ncountry. After his promotion to the government, finding that the\r\npeople had little confidence in him, and shewing [Errata: knowing]\r\nthat he had no interest at home to support him, but what he had\r\nacquired by joining with Bernard in kicking up a dust, he determined\r\nto strike a bold stroke, and in a formal speech to both houses,\r\nbecame a champion for the unbounded authority of parliament, over the\r\nColonies. This he thought would lay the ministry under obligation to\r\nsupport him in the government, or else to provide for him out of it,\r\nnot considering that starting that question before that assembly,\r\nand calling upon them, as he did, to dispute with him upon it, was\r\nscattering firebrands, arrows and death in sport. The arguments he\r\nthen advanced were inconclusive indeed: but they shall be considered,\r\nwhen I come to the feeble attempt of Massachusettensis to give a\r\ncolour to the same position.\r\n\r\nThe house, thus called upon, either to acknowledge the unlimited\r\nauthority of parliament, or confute his arguments, were bound by\r\ntheir duty to God, their country and posterity, to give him a full\r\nand explicit answer. They proved incontestibly, that he was out in\r\nhis facts, inconsistent with himself, and in every principle of his\r\nlaw, he had committed a blunder. Thus the fowler was caught in his\r\nown snare; and although this country has suffered severe temporary\r\ncalamities in consequence of this speech, yet I hope they will not\r\nbe durable; but his ruin was certainly in part owing to it. Nothing\r\never opened the eyes of the people so much, as his designs, excepting\r\nhis letters. Thus it is the fate of Massachusettensis to praise this\r\ngentleman, for these things which the wise part of mankind condemn\r\nin him, as the most insidious and mischievous of actions. If it was\r\nout of his power to do us any more injuries, I should wish to forget\r\nthe past; but as there is reason to fear he is still to continue his\r\nmalevolent labours against this country, although he is out of our\r\nsight, he ought not to be out of our minds. This country has every\r\nthing to fear, in the present state of the British court, while\r\nthe lords Bute, Mansfield and North have the principal conduct of\r\naffairs, from the deep intrigues of that artful man.\r\n\r\nTo proceed to his successor, whom Massachusettensis has been pleased\r\nto compliment with the epithet of \"amiable.\" I have no inclination\r\nto detract from this praise, but have no panegyricks or invectives\r\nfor any man, much less for any governor, until satisfied of his\r\ncharacter and designs. This gentleman's conduct, although he came\r\nhere to support the systems of his two predecessors, and contracted\r\nto throw himself into the arms of their connections, when he has\r\nacted himself, and not been teased by others much less amiable and\r\njudicious than himself, into measures which his own inclination would\r\nhave avoided, has been in general as unexceptionable as could be\r\nexpected, in his very delicate, intricate and difficult situation.\r\n\r\nWe are then told \"that disaffection to Great Britain was infused\r\ninto the body of the people.\" The leading whigs, have ever,\r\nsystematically, and upon principle, endeavoured to preserve the\r\npeople from all disaffection to the king on the one hand, and the\r\nbody of the people on the other; but to lay the blame where it is\r\njustly due on the ministry and their instruments.\r\n\r\nWe are next conducted into the superior court, and informed \"that\r\nthe judges were dependant on the annual grants of the general court;\r\nthat their salaries were small in proportion to the salaries of\r\nother officers, of less importance; that they often petitioned the\r\nassembly to enlarge them, without success, and were reminded of their\r\ndependance; that they remained unshaken amid the raging tempests,\r\nwhich is to be attributed rather to their firmness than situation.\"\r\n\r\nThat the salaries were small, must be allowed: but not smaller\r\nin proportion than those of other officers. All salaries in this\r\nprovince have been and are small. It has been the policy of the\r\ncountry to keep them so, not so much from a spirit of parsimony, as\r\nan opinion, that the service of the public ought to be an honorary,\r\nrather than a lucrative employment; and that the great men ought to\r\nbe obliged to set examples of simplicity and frugality before the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nBut if we consider things maturely, and make allowance for all\r\ncircumstances, I think the country may be vindicated. This province,\r\nduring the last war, had such overbearing burdens upon it, that it\r\nwas necessitated to use economy in every thing. At the peace she\r\nwas half a million sterling in debt, nearly. She thought it the\r\nbest policy to get out of debt, before she raised the wages of her\r\nservants; and if Great Britain had thought as wisely, she would not\r\nnow have had 140 millions to pay; and she would never have thought of\r\ntaxing America.\r\n\r\nLow as the wages were, it was found that, whenever a vacancy\r\nhappened, the place was solicited with much more anxiety and zeal,\r\nthan the kingdom of heaven.\r\n\r\nAnother cause which had its effect was this. The judges of that court\r\nhad almost always enjoyed some other office. At the time of the stamp\r\nact the chief justice was lieutenant governor, which yielded him\r\na profit, and a judge of probate for the county of Suffolk, which\r\nyielded him another profit, and a counsellor, which if it was not\r\nvery profitable, gave him an opportunity of promoting his family and\r\nfriends to other profitable offices, an opportunity which the country\r\nsaw he most religiously improved. Another justice of this court was a\r\njudge of admiralty, and another was judge of probate for the county\r\nof Plymouth. The people thought therefore, that as their time was not\r\nwholly taken up by their offices, as judges of the superior court,\r\nthere was no reason why they should be paid as much, as if it had\r\nbeen.\r\n\r\nAnother reason was this: those justices had not been bred to the bar,\r\nbut taken from merchandise, husbandry and other occupations; had been\r\nat no great expence for education, or libraries, and therefore the\r\npeople thought that equity did not demand large salaries.\r\n\r\nIt must be confessed that another motive had its weight. The people\r\nwere growing jealous of the chief justice and two other justices at\r\nleast, and therefore thought it imprudent to enlarge their salaries,\r\nand by that means their influence.\r\n\r\nWhether all these arguments were sufficient to vindicate the people\r\nfor not enlarging their salaries, I shall leave to you, my friends,\r\nwhose right it is to judge. But that the judges petitioned \"often\" to\r\nthe assembly I do not remember. I knew it was suspected by many, and\r\nconfidently affirmed by some, that judge Russell carried home with\r\nhim, in 1766, a petition to his majesty, subscribed by himself, and\r\nchief justice Hutchinson at least, praying his majesty to take the\r\npayment of the judges into his own hands; and that this petition,\r\ntogether with the solicitations of governor Bernard, and others, had\r\nthe success to procure the act of parliament, to enable his majesty\r\nto appropriate the revenue to the support of the administration of\r\njustice, &c. from whence a great part of the present calamities of\r\nAmerica have flowed.\r\n\r\nThat the high whigs took _care_ to get themselves chosen of the grand\r\njuries I do not believe. Nine tenths of the people were high whigs;\r\nand therefore it was not easy to get a grand jury without nine whigs\r\nin ten, in it. And the matter would not be much mended by the new\r\nact of parliament. The sheriff must return the same set of jurors,\r\ncourt after court, or else his juries would be nine tenths of them\r\nhigh whigs still. Indeed the tories are so envenomed now with malice,\r\nenvy, revenge and disappointed ambition, that they would be willing,\r\nfor what I know, to be jurors for life, in order to give verdicts\r\nagainst the whigs. And many of them would readily do it, I doubt not,\r\nwithout any other law or evidence, than what they found in their\r\nown breasts. The suggestion of legerdemain, in drawing the names of\r\npetit jurors out of the box, is scandalous. Human wisdom cannot\r\ndevise a method of obtaining petit jurors more fairly, and better\r\nsecured against a possibility of corruption of any kind, than that\r\nestablished by our provincial law. They were drawn by chance out of\r\na box, in open town meeting, to which the tories went, or might have\r\ngone, as well as the whigs, and have seen with their own eyes, that\r\nnothing unfair ever did or could take place. If the jurors consisted\r\nof whigs, it was because the freeholders were whigs, that is honest\r\nmen. But now, it seems, if Massachusettensis can have his will, the\r\nsheriff, who will be a person properly qualified for the purpose, is\r\nto pick out a tory jury, if he can find one in ten, or one in twenty\r\nof that character among the freeholders; and it is no doubt expected,\r\nthat every newspaper that presumes to deny the right of parliament\r\nto tax us, or destroy our charter, will be presented as a libel, and\r\nevery member of a committee of correspondence, or a congress, &c. &c.\r\n&c. are to be indicted for rebellion. These would be pleasant times\r\nto Massachusettensis and the junto, but they will never live to see\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\"The judges pointed out seditious libels, on governors, magistrates,\r\nand the whole government to no effect.\" They did so. But the\r\njurors thought some of these no libels, but solemn truths. At one\r\ntime, I have heard that all the newspapers for several years, the\r\nMassachusetts Gazette, Evening Post, Boston Chronicle, Boston\r\nGazette, and Massachusetts Spy, were laid before a grand jury at\r\nonce. The jurors thought there were multitudes of libels written by\r\nthe tories, and they did not know whom they should attack, if they\r\npresented them; perhaps governor Bernard, lieut. governor Hutchinson,\r\nsecretary Oliver--possibly the attorney general. They saw so many\r\ndifficulties they knew not what to do.\r\n\r\nAs to the riots and insurrections, it is surprising that this writer\r\nshould say \"scarce one offender was indicted, and I think not one\r\nconvicted.\" Were not many indicted, convicted, and punished too\r\nin the county of Essex, and Middlesex, and indeed in every other\r\ncounty? But perhaps he will say, he means such as were connected\r\nwith politicks. Yet this is not true, for a large number in Essex\r\nwere punished for abusing an informer, and others were indicted and\r\nconvicted in Boston for a similar offence. None were indicted for\r\npulling down the stamp office, because this was thought an honorable\r\nand glorious action, not a riot. And so it must be said of several\r\nother tumults. But was not this the case in royal as well as charter\r\ngovernments? Nor will this inconvenience be remedied by a sheriff's\r\njury, if such an one should ever sit. For if such a jury should\r\nconvict, the people will never bear the punishment. It is in vain to\r\nexpect or hope to carry on government, against the universal bent and\r\ngenius of the people; we may whimper and whine as much as we will,\r\nbut nature made it impossible, when she made men.\r\n\r\nIf causes of _meum_ and _tuum_ were not always exempt from party\r\ninfluence, the tories will get no credit by an examination into\r\nparticular cases. Though I believe there was no great blame on\r\neither party, in this respect, where the case was not connected with\r\npoliticks.\r\n\r\nWe are then told \"the whigs once flattered themselves they should be\r\nable to divide the province between them.\" I suppose he means, that\r\nthey should be able to get the honorable and lucrative offices of the\r\nprovince into their hands. If this was true, they would be chargeable\r\nwith only designing what the tories have actually done; with this\r\ndifference, that the whigs would have done it by saving the liberties\r\nand the constitution of the province--whereas the tories have done it\r\nby the destruction of both. That the whigs have ambition, a desire of\r\nprofit, and other passions, like other men, it would be foolish to\r\ndeny. But this writer cannot name a set of men in the whole British\r\nempire, who have sacrificed their private interest to their nation's\r\nhonour, and the public good, in so remarkable a manner, as the\r\nleading whigs have done, in the two last administrations.\r\n\r\n\"As to cutting asunder the sinews of government and breaking in\r\npieces the ligament of social life,\" as far as this has been done, I\r\nhave proved by incontestible evidence from Bernard's, Hutchinson's\r\nand Oliver's letters, that the tories have done it, against all the\r\nendeavours of the whigs to prevent them from first to last.\r\n\r\nThe public is then amused with two instances of the weakness of\r\nour government, and these are, with equal artifice and injustice,\r\ninsinuated to be chargeable upon the whigs. But the whigs are as\r\ninnocent of these, as the tories. Malcom was as much against the\r\ninclinations and judgment of the whigs as the tories. But the real\r\ninjury, he received, is exaggerated by this writer. The cruelty of\r\nhis whipping, and the danger of his life, are too highly coloured.\r\n\r\nMalcom was such an oddity as naturally to excite the curiosity and\r\nridicule of the lowest class of people, wherever he went: had been\r\nactive in battle against the regulators in North Carolina, who were\r\nthought in Boston to be an injured people. A few weeks before, he\r\nhad made a seizure at Kennebeck river, 150 miles from Boston, and by\r\nsome imprudence had excited the wrath of the people there, in such a\r\ndegree, that they tarred and feathered him over his clothes. He comes\r\nto Boston to complain. The news of it was spread in town. It was a\r\ncritical time, when the passions of the people were warm. Malcom\r\nattacked a lad in the street, and cut his head with a cutlass, in\r\nreturn for some words from the boy, which I suppose were irritating.\r\nThe boy run bleeding through the street to his relations, of whom\r\nhe had many. As he passed the street, the people inquired into the\r\ncause of his wounds, and a sudden heat arose against Malcom, which\r\nneither whigs nor tories, though both endeavoured it, could restrain;\r\nand produced the injuries of which he justly complained. But such a\r\ncoincidence of circumstances might, at any time, and in any place,\r\nhave produced such an effect; and therefore it is no evidence of the\r\nweakness of government. Why he petitioned the general court, unless\r\nhe was advised to it by the tories, to make a noise, I know not. That\r\ncourt had nothing to do with it. He might have brought his action\r\nagainst the trespassers, but never did. He chose to go to England and\r\nget 200l. a year, which would make his tarring the luckiest incident\r\nof his life.\r\n\r\nThe hospital at Marblehead is another instance, no more owing to the\r\npoliticks of the times, than the burning of the temple at Ephesus.\r\nThis hospital was newly erected, much against the will of the\r\nmultitude. The patients were careless, some of them wantonly so,\r\nand others were suspected of designing to spread the small pox in\r\nthe town, which was full of people, who had not passed through the\r\ndistemper. It is needless to be particular, but the apprehension\r\nbecame general, the people arose and burnt the hospital. But the\r\nwhigs are so little blameable for this, that two of the principal\r\nwhigs in the province, gentlemen highly esteemed and beloved in the\r\ntown, even by those who burnt the building, were owners of it. The\r\nprinciples and temper of the times had no share in this, any more\r\nthan in cutting down the market in Boston, or in demolishing mills\r\nand dams in some parts of the country, in order to let the alewives\r\npass up the streams, forty years ago. Such incidents happen in all\r\ngovernments at times, and it is a fresh proof of the weakness of this\r\nwriter's cause, that he is driven to such wretched shifts to defend\r\nit.\r\n\r\nTowards the close of this long speculation, Massachusettensis grows\r\nmore and more splenetical, peevish, angry and absurd.\r\n\r\nHe tells us, that in order to avoid the necessity of altering\r\nour provincial constitution, government at home made the judges\r\nindependent of the grants of the general assembly. That is, in order\r\nto avoid the hazard of taking the fort by storm, they determined to\r\ntake it by sap. In order to avoid altering our constitution, they\r\nchanged it in the most essential manner: for surely by our charter\r\nthe province was to pay the judges as well as the governor. Taking\r\naway this privilege, and making them receive their pay from the\r\ncrown, was destroying the charter so far forth, and making them\r\ndependent on the minister. As to their being dependent on the leading\r\nwhigs, he means they were dependent on the province. And which is\r\nfairest to be dependent on, the province or on the minister? In all\r\nthis troublesome period, the leading whigs had never hesitated about\r\ngranting their salaries, nor ever once moved to have them lessened,\r\nnor would the house have listened to them if they had. \"This was\r\ndone, he says, to make them steady.\" We know that very well. Steady\r\nto what? Steady to the plans of Bernard, Hutchinson, Oliver, North,\r\nMansfield and Bute; which the people thought was steadiness to\r\ntheir ruin, and therefore it was found, that a determined spirit of\r\nopposition to it arose, in every part of the province, like that to\r\nthe stamp act.\r\n\r\nThe chief justice, it is true, was accused by the house of\r\nrepresentatives, of receiving a bribe, a ministerial, not a royal\r\nbribe. For the king can do no wrong, although he may be deceived in\r\nhis grant. The minister is accountable. The crime of receiving an\r\nillegal patent, is not the less for purchasing it, even of the king\r\nhimself. Many impeachments have been for such offences.\r\n\r\nHe talks about attempts to strengthen government, and save our\r\ncharter. With what modesty can he say this, when he knows that the\r\noverthrow of our charter was the very object which the junto had\r\nbeen invariably pursuing for a long course of years? Does he think\r\nhis readers are to be deceived by such gross arts? But he says \"the\r\nwhigs subverted the charter constitution, abridged the freedom of\r\nthe house, annihilated the freedom of the board, and rendered the\r\ngovernor a doge of Venice.\" The freedom of the house was never\r\nabridged, the freedom of the board was never lessened. The governor\r\nhad as much power as ever. The house and board, it is true, would\r\ndo nothing in favour of parliamentary taxation. Their judgments and\r\nconsciences were against it; and if they ever had done any thing in\r\nfavour of it, it would have been through fear and not freedom. The\r\ngovernor found he could do nothing in favour of it, excepting to\r\npromote, in every department in the state, men who hated the people\r\nand were hated by them. Enough of this he did in all conscience;\r\nand after filling offices with men who were despised, he wondered\r\nthat the officers were not revered. \"They, the whigs, engrossed all\r\nthe power of the province into their own hands.\" That is, the house\r\nand board were whigs; the grand juries and petit juries were whigs;\r\ntowns were whigs; the clergy were whigs; the agents were whigs; and\r\nwherever you found people, you found all whigs; excepting those\r\nwho had commissions from the crown or the governor. This is almost\r\ntrue, and it is to the eternal shame of the tories, that they should\r\npursue their ignis fatuus with such ungovernable fury as they have\r\ndone, after such repeated and multiplied demonstrations, that the\r\nwhole people were so universally bent against them. But nothing will\r\nsatisfy them still, but blood and carnage. The destruction of the\r\nwhigs, charters, English liberties and all, they must and will have,\r\nif it costs the blood of tens of thousands of innocent people. This\r\nis the benign temper of the tories.\r\n\r\nThis influence of the whigs, he calls a democracy or republic,\r\nand then a despotism: two ideas incompatible with each other. A\r\ndemocratical despotism is a contradiction in terms.\r\n\r\nHe then says, that \"the good policy of the act for regulating the\r\ngovernment in this province, will be the subject of some future\r\npaper.\" But that paper is still to come, and I suspect ever will be.\r\nI wish to hear him upon it however.\r\n\r\nWith this, he and the junto ought to have begun. Bernard and the\r\nrest, in 1764, ought to have published their objections to this\r\ngovernment, if they had been honest men, and produced their arguments\r\nin favour of the alteration, convinced the people of the necessity of\r\nit, and proposed some constitutional plan for effecting it. But the\r\nsame motives which induced them to take another course, will prevail\r\nwith Massachusettensis to wave the good policy of the act. He will\r\nbe much more cunningly employed in labouring to terrify women and\r\nchildren with the horrors of a civil war, and the dread of a division\r\namong the people. There lies your fort, Massachusettensis, make the\r\nmost of it.\r\n\r\nNOVANGLUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESSED\r\n\r\n_To the Inhabitants of the Colony of Massachusetts Bay_,\r\n\r\nFebruary 27, 1775.\r\n\r\n\r\nMY FRIENDS,\r\n\r\nSuch events as the resistance to the stamp act, and to the tea act,\r\nparticularly the destruction of that which was sent by the ministry,\r\nin the name of the East India Company, have ever been cautiously\r\nspoken of by the whigs, because they knew the delicacy of the\r\nsubject, and they lived in continual hopes of a speedy restoration\r\nof liberty and peace. But we are now thrown into a situation, which\r\nwould render any further delicacy upon this point criminal.\r\n\r\nBe it remembered then, that there are tumults, seditions, popular\r\ncommotions, insurrections and civil wars, upon just occasions, as\r\nwell as unjust.\r\n\r\nGrotius B. 1. c. 3. § 1. observes, \"that some sort of private war may\r\nbe lawfully waged--It is not repugnant to the law of nature, for any\r\none to repel injuries by force.\"\r\n\r\n§ 2. The liberty allowed before is much restrained, since the\r\nerection of tribunals. Yet there are some cases wherein that right\r\nstill subsists; that is, when the way to legal justice is not open;\r\nfor the law which forbids a man to pursue his right any other way,\r\nought to be understood with this equitable restriction, that one\r\nfinds judges to whom he need apply, &c.\r\n\r\nSidney's discourses upon government c. 2. § 24. 'Tis in vain to seek\r\na government in all points free from a possibility of civil wars,\r\ntumults and seditions: that is a blessing denied to this life, and\r\nreserved to complete the felicity of the next. Seditions, tumults,\r\nand wars do arise from mistake or from malice; from just occasions\r\nor unjust. Seditions proceeding from malice are seldom or never seen\r\nin popular governments; for they are hurtful to the people, and none\r\nhave ever willingly and knowingly hurt themselves. There may he, and\r\noften is, malice in those who excite them; but the people is ever\r\ndeceived, and whatever is thereupon done, ought to be imputed to\r\nerror, &c. But in absolute monarchies, almost all the troubles that\r\narise proceed from malice; they cannot be reformed; the extinction\r\nof them is exceeding difficult, if they have continued long enough\r\nto corrupt the people; and those who appear against them seek only\r\nto set up themselves or their friends. The mischiefs designed are\r\noften dissembled, or denied, till they are past all possibility of\r\nbeing cured by any other way than force; and such as are by necessity\r\ndriven to use that remedy, know they must perfect their work or\r\nperish. He that draws his sword against the prince, say the French,\r\nought to throw away the scabbard; for though the design be never so\r\njust, yet the authors are sure to be ruined if it miscarry. Peace is\r\nseldom made, and never kept, unless the subject retain such a power\r\nin his hands, as may oblige the prince to stand to what is agreed;\r\nand in time some trick is found to deprive him of that benefit.\r\n\r\nIt may seem strange to some that I mention seditions, tumults and\r\nwars, upon just occasions; but I can find no reason to retract the\r\nterms. God, intending that men should live justly with one another,\r\ndoes certainly intend that he or they, who do no wrong, should\r\nsuffer none; and the law that forbids injuries, were of no use, if\r\nno penalty might be inflicted on those, that will not obey it. If\r\ninjustice therefore be evil, and injuries be forbidden, they are\r\nalso to be punished; and the law, instituted for their prevention,\r\nmust necessarily intend the avenging of such as cannot be prevented.\r\nThe work of the magistracy is to execute this law; the sword of\r\njustice is put into their hands to restrain the fury of those within\r\nthe society, who will not be a law to themselves; and the sword\r\nof war to protect the people against the violence of foreigners.\r\nThis is without exception, and would be in vain if it were not.\r\nBut the magistrate who is to protect the people from injury, may,\r\nand is often known, not to have done it: he sometimes renders his\r\noffice _useless by neglecting to do justice_; sometimes _mischievous\r\nby overthrowing it_. This strikes at the root of God's general\r\nordinance, that there should be laws; and the particular ordinances\r\nof all societies that appoint such as seem best to them. _The\r\nmagistrate therefore is comprehended under both, and subject to both,\r\nas well as private men._\r\n\r\nThe ways of preventing or punishing injuries are judicial or\r\nextrajudicial. Judicial proceedings are of force against those\r\nwho submit, or may be brought to trial, but are of no effect\r\nagainst those who resist, and are of such power that they cannot\r\nbe constrained. It were absurd to cite a man to appear before a\r\ntribunal, _who can awe the judges, or has armies to defend him_;\r\nand impious to think that he who has added treachery to his other\r\ncrimes, and usurped a power above the law, should be protected by the\r\nenormity of his wickedness. Legal proceedings, therefore, are to be\r\nused when the delinquent submits to the law; _and all are just; when\r\nhe will not be kept in order by the legal_.\r\n\r\nThe word sedition is generally applied to all numerous assemblies,\r\nwithout or against the authority of the magistrate, or of those who\r\nassume that power. Athaliah and Jezebel were more ready to cry out\r\ntreason, than David, &c.\r\n\r\nTumult is from the disorderly manner of those assemblies, where\r\nthings can seldom be done regularly; and war is that \"decertatio\r\nper vim,\" or trial by force, to which men come, when other ways are\r\nineffectual.\r\n\r\nIf the laws of God and men, are therefore of no effect, when the\r\nmagistracy is left at liberty to break them; and if the lusts of\r\nthose who are too strong for the tribunals of justice, cannot be\r\notherwise restrained than by sedition, tumults and war; those\r\nseditions, tumults and wars, are justified by the laws of God and man.\r\n\r\nI will not take upon me to enumerate all the cases in which this may\r\nbe done, but content myself with three, which have most frequently\r\ngiven occasion for proceedings of this kind. The first is, when one\r\nor more men take upon them the power and name of a magistracy, to\r\nwhich they are not justly called. The second, when one or more being\r\njustly called, continue in their magistracy longer than the laws by\r\nwhich they are called, do prescribe. And the third, when he or they,\r\nwho are rightly called, do assume a power, though within the time\r\nprescribed, that the law does not give; or turn that which the law\r\ndoes give, to an end different and contrary to that which is intended\r\nby it.\r\n\r\nThe same course is justly used against a legal magistrate, who takes\r\nupon him to exercise a power which the law does not give; for in that\r\nrespect he is a private man. \"Quia, as Grotius says, eatenus non\r\nhabet imperium,\" and may be restrained as well as any other, because\r\nhe is not set up to do what he lists, but what the law appoints for\r\nthe good of the people; and as he has no other power than what the\r\nlaw allows, so the same law limits and directs the exercise of that\r\nwhich he has.\r\n\r\nPuffendorf's law of nature and nations L. 7. c. 8. § 5 and 6.\r\nBarbeyrac's note on section 6. When we speak of a tyrant that may\r\nlawfully be dethroned, we do not mean by the people, the vile\r\npopulace or rabble of the country, nor the cabal of a small number\r\nof factious persons; but the greater and more judicious part of the\r\nsubjects of all ranks. Besides the tyranny must be so notorious and\r\nevidently clear, as to leave no body any room to doubt of it, &c. Now\r\na prince may easily avoid making himself so universally suspected and\r\nodious to his subjects; for as Mr. Locke says, in his treatise of\r\ncivil government, c. 18 § 209. \"It is as impossible for a governor,\r\nif he really means the good of the people and the preservation of\r\nthem and the laws together, not to make them see and feel it; as it\r\nis for the father of a family, not to let his children see he loves\r\nand takes care of them.\" And therefore the general insurrection of\r\na whole nation does not deserve the name of a rebellion. We may see\r\nwhat Mr. Sidney says upon this subject in his discourse concerning\r\ngovernment c. 3. § 36. Neither are subjects bound to stay till the\r\nprince has entirely finished the chains which he is preparing for\r\nthem, and put it out of their power to oppose. It is sufficient that\r\nall the advances which he makes are manifestly tending to their\r\noppression, that he is marching boldly on to the ruin of the state.\r\nIn such a case, says Mr. Locke, admirably well, ubi supra § 210. \"How\r\ncan a man any more hinder himself from believing in his own mind,\r\nwhich way things are going, or from casting about to save himself,\r\nthan he could from believing the captain of the ship he was in, was\r\ncarrying him and the rest of his company to Algiers, when he found\r\nhim always steering that course, though cross winds, leaks in his\r\nship and want of men and provisions, did often force him to turn\r\nhis course another way for some time, which he steadily returned to\r\nagain, as soon as the winds, weather, and other circumstances would\r\nlet him.\" This chiefly takes place with respect to kings, whose power\r\nis limited by fundamental laws.\r\n\r\nIf it is objected, that the people being ignorant, and always\r\ndiscontented, to lay the foundation of government, in the unsteady\r\nopinion and the uncertain humour of the people, is to expose it to\r\ncertain ruin; the same author will answer you, that on the contrary,\r\npeople are not so easily got out of their old forms as some are\r\napt to suggest. England, for instance, notwithstanding the many\r\nrevolutions that have been seen in that kingdom, has always kept\r\nto its old legislative of king, lords, and commons; and whatever\r\nprovocations have made the crown to be taken from some of their\r\nprinces' heads, they never carried the people so far as to place\r\nit in another line. But it will be said, this hypothesis lays a\r\nferment for frequent rebellion. No more, says Mr. Locke, than any\r\nother hypothesis. For when the people are made miserable, and\r\nfind themselves exposed to the ill usage of arbitrary power; cry\r\nup their governors as you will for sons of Jupiter, let them be\r\nsacred and divine, descended or authorised from heaven; give them\r\nout for whom or what you please, the same will happen. The people\r\ngenerally ill treated, and contrary to right, will be ready upon any\r\noccasion to ease themselves of a burden that sits heavy upon them.\r\n2. Such revolutions happen not upon every little mismanagement in\r\npublic affairs. Great mistakes in the ruling part, many wrong and\r\ninconvenient laws, and all the slips of human frailty will be borne\r\nby the people, without mutiny and murmur. 3. This power in the people\r\nof providing for their safety anew by a legislative, when their\r\nlegislators have acted contrary to their trust, by invading their\r\nproperty, is the best fence against rebellion, and the probablest\r\nmeans to hinder it; for rebellion being an opposition, not to\r\npersons, but authority, which is founded only in the constitutions\r\nand laws of the government; those whoever they be, _who by force\r\nbreak through, and by force justify the violation of them, are truly\r\nand properly rebels_. For when men by entering into society, and\r\ncivil government, have excluded force, and introduced laws for the\r\npreservation of property, peace and unity, among themselves; those\r\nwho set up force again, in opposition to the laws, do rebellare,\r\nthat is, do bring back again the state of war, and are properly,\r\nrebels, as the author shews. In the last place, he demonstrates that\r\nthere are also greater inconveniencies in allowing all to those that\r\ngovern, than in granting something to the people. But it will be\r\nsaid, that ill affected and factious men may spread among the people,\r\nand make them believe that the prince or legislative, act contrary\r\nto their trust, when they only make use of their due prerogative.\r\nTo this Mr. Locke answers, that the people however is to judge of\r\nall that; because no body can better judge whether his trustee or\r\ndeputy acts well, and according to the trust reposed in him, than he\r\nwho deputed him. He might make the like query, (says Mr. LeClerk,\r\nfrom whom this extract is taken) and ask, whether the people being\r\noppressed by an authority which they set up, but for their own good,\r\nit is just, that those who are vested with this authority, and of\r\nwhich they are complaining, should themselves be judges of the\r\ncomplaints made against them. The greatest flatterers of kings, dare\r\nnot say, that the people are obliged to suffer absolutely all their\r\nhumours, how irregular soever they be; and therefore must confess,\r\nthat when no regard is had to their complaints, the very foundations\r\nof society are destroyed; the prince and people are in a state of\r\nwar with each other, like two independent states, that are doing\r\nthemselves justice, and acknowledge no person upon earth, who in a\r\nsovereign manner, can determine the disputes between them, &c.\r\n\r\nIf there is any thing in these quotations, which is applicable to the\r\ndestruction of the tea, or any other branch of our subject, it is not\r\nmy fault; I did not make it. Surely Grotius, Puffendorf, Barbeyrac,\r\nLocke, Sidney, and LeClerk, are writers, of sufficient weight to\r\nput in the scale against the mercenary scribblers in New York and\r\nBoston, who have the unexampled impudence and folly, to call these\r\nwhich are revolution principles in question, and to ground their\r\narguments upon passive obedience as a corner stone. What an opinion\r\nmust these writers have of the principles of their patrons, the lords\r\nBute, Mansfield and North, when they hope to recommend themselves\r\nby reviving that stupid doctrine, which has been infamous so many\r\nyears. Dr. Sachevaril himself tells us that his sermons were burnt by\r\nthe hands of the common hangman, by the order of the king, lords and\r\ncommons, in order to fix an eternal and indelible brand of infamy on\r\nthat doctrine.\r\n\r\nIn the Gazette of January the 2d, Massachusettensis entertains you\r\nwith an account of his own important self. This is a subject which he\r\nhas very much at heart, but it is of no consequence to you or me, and\r\ntherefore little need be said of it. If he had such a stand in the\r\ncommunity, that he could have seen all the political manoeuvres,\r\nit is plain he must have shut his eyes, or he never could have\r\nmistaken so grossly, causes for effects, and effects for causes.\r\n\r\nHe undertakes to point out the principles and motives upon which the\r\nblockade act was made, which were according to him, the destruction\r\nof the East India Company's tea. He might have said more properly the\r\nministerial tea; for such it was, and the company are no losers; they\r\nhave received from the public treasury compensation for it.\r\n\r\nThen we are amused with a long discourse about the nature of the\r\nBritish government, commerce, agriculture, arts, manufactures,\r\nregulations of trade, custom-house officers, which, as it has no\r\nrelation to the subject, I shall pass over.\r\n\r\nThe case is shortly this. The East India Company, by their contract\r\nwith government, in their charter and statute, are bound in\r\nconsideration of their important profitable privileges to pay to the\r\npublic treasury, a revenue, annually, of four hundred thousand pounds\r\nsterling, so long as they can hold up their dividends, at twelve per\r\ncent. and no longer.\r\n\r\nThe mistaken policy of the ministry, in obstinately persisting in\r\ntheir claim of right to tax America, and refusing to repeal the\r\nduty on tea, with those on glass, paper and paint, had induced all\r\nAmerica, except a few merchants in Boston, most of whom were closely\r\nconnected with the junto, to refuse to import tea from Great Britain;\r\nthe consequence of which was a kind of stagnation in the affairs of\r\nthe company, and an immense accumulation of tea in their stores,\r\nwhich they could not sell. This, among other causes, contributed\r\nto affect their credit, and their dividends were on the point of\r\nfalling below twelve per cent. and consequently the government was\r\nupon the point of losing 400,000l. sterling a year of revenue. The\r\ncompany solicited the ministry to take off the duty in America: but\r\nthey adhering to their plan of taxing the colonies and establishing\r\na precedent, framed an act to enable the company to send their tea\r\ndirectly to America. This was admired as a master-piece of policy.\r\nIt was thought they would accomplish four great purposes at once:\r\nestablish their precedent of taxing America; raise a large revenue\r\nthere by the duties; save the credit of the company, and the\r\n400,000l. to the government. The company however, were so little\r\npleased with this, that there were great debates among the directors,\r\nwhether they should risque it, which were finally determined by a\r\nmajority of one only, and that one the chairman, being unwilling\r\nas it is said, to interfere, in the dispute between the minister\r\nand the colonies, and uncertain what the result would be: and this\r\nsmall majority was not obtained, as it is said, until a sufficient\r\nintimation was given that the company should not be losers.\r\n\r\nWhen these designs were made known, it appeared, that American\r\npoliticians were not to be deceived; that their sight was as quick\r\nand clear as the minister's; and that they were as steady to their\r\npurpose, as he was to his. This was thought by all the colonies to\r\nbe the precise point of time, when it became absolutely necessary\r\nto make a stand. If the tea should be landed, it would be sold;\r\nif sold, the duties would amount to a large sum, which would be\r\ninstantly applied to increase the friends and advocates for more\r\nduties, and to divide the people; and the company would get such a\r\nfooting, that no opposition afterwards could ever be effectual. And\r\nas soon as the duties on tea should be established, they would be\r\nranked among post-office fees, and other precedents, and used as\r\narguments, both of the right and expediency of laying on others,\r\nperhaps on all the necessaries, as well as conveniences and luxuries\r\nof life. The whole continent was united in the sentiment, that all\r\nopposition to parliamentary taxation must be given up forever,\r\nif this critical moment was neglected. Accordingly, New York and\r\nPhiladelphia determined that the ships should be sent back; and\r\nCharleston, that the tea should be stored and locked up. This was\r\nattended with no danger in that city, because they are fully united\r\nin sentiment and affection, and have no _Junto_ to perplex them.\r\nBoston was under greater difficulties. The consignees at New York\r\nand Philadelphia most readily resigned. The consignees at Boston,\r\nthe children, cousins, and most intimate connections of governor\r\nHutchinson, refused. I am very sorry that I cannot stir a single step\r\nin developing the causes of my country's miseries, without stumbling\r\nupon this gentleman. But so it is. From the near relation and most\r\nintimate connection of the consignees with him, there is great cause\r\nof jealousy, if not a violent presumption, that he was at the bottom\r\nof all this business, that he had planned it, in his confidential\r\nletters with Bernard, and both of them joined in suggesting and\r\nrecommending it to the ministry. Without this supposition, it is\r\ndifficult to account for the obstinacy with which the consignees\r\nrefused to resign, and the governor to let the vessel go. However\r\nthis might be, Boston is the only place upon the continent, perhaps\r\nin the world, which ever breeds a species of misanthropes, who will\r\npersist in their schemes for their private interest, with such\r\nobstinacy, in opposition to the public good; disoblige all their\r\nfellow citizens for a little pelf, and make themselves odious and\r\ninfamous, when they might be respected and esteemed. It must be said,\r\nhowever, in vindication of the town, that this breed is spawned\r\nchiefly by the Junto. The consignees would not resign; the custom\r\nhouse refused clearances; governor Hutchinson refused passes by the\r\ncastle. The question then was, with many, whether the governor,\r\nofficers, and consignees should be compelled to send the ships hence?\r\nAn army and navy was at hand, and bloodshed was apprehended. At last,\r\nwhen the continent, as well as the town and province, were waiting\r\nthe issue of this deliberation with the utmost anxiety, a number\r\nof persons, in the night, put them out of suspense, by an oblation\r\nto Neptune. I have heard some gentlemen say, \"this was a very\r\nunjustifiable proceeding\"--\"that if they had gone at noon-day, and\r\nin their ordinary habits, and drowned it in the face of the world, it\r\nwould have been a meritorious, a most glorious action: but to go in\r\nthe night, and much more in disguise, they thought very inexcusable.\"\r\n\r\n\"The revenue was not the consideration before parliament,\" says\r\nMassachusettensis. Let who will believe him. But if it was not, the\r\ndanger to America was the same. I take no notice of the idea of a\r\nmonopoly. If it had been only a monopoly (though in this light it\r\nwould have been a very great grievance) it would not have excited,\r\nnor in the opinion of any one justified the step that was taken. It\r\nwas an attack upon a fundamental principle of the constitution, and\r\nupon that supposition was resisted, after multitudes of petitions to\r\nno purpose, and because there was no tribunal in the constitution,\r\nfrom whence redress could have been obtained.\r\n\r\nThere is one passage so pretty, that I cannot refuse myself the\r\npleasure of transcribing it. \"A smuggler and a whig are cousin\r\nGermans, the offspring of two sisters, avarice and ambition. They\r\nhad been playing into each other's hands a long time. The smuggler\r\nreceived protection from the whig, and he in his turn received\r\nsupport from the smuggler. The illicit trader now demanded protection\r\nfrom his kinsman, and it would have been unnatural in him to have\r\nrefused it; and beside, an opportunity presented of strengthening his\r\nown interest.\"\r\n\r\nThe wit and the beauty of the style, in this place, seem to have\r\nquite enraptured the lively juvenile imagination of this writer.\r\n\r\nThe truth of the fact he never regards, any more than the justice\r\nof the sentiment. Some years ago, the smugglers might be pretty\r\nequally divided between the whigs and the tories. Since that time,\r\nthey have almost all married into the tory families, for the sake of\r\ndispensations and indulgencies. If I were to let myself into secret\r\nhistory, I could tell very diverting stories of smuggling tories in\r\nNew-York and Boston. Massachusettensis is quarrelling with some of\r\nhis best friends. Let him learn more discretion.\r\n\r\nWe are then told that \"the consignees offered to store the tea,\r\nunder the care of the selectmen, or a committee of the town.\" This\r\nexpedient might have answered, if none of the junto, nor any of\r\ntheir connections, had been in Boston. But is it a wonder, that the\r\nselectmen declined accepting such a deposit? They supposed they\r\nshould be answerable, and nobody doubted that tories might be found\r\nwho would not scruple to set fire to the store, in order to make them\r\nliable. Besides if the tea was landed, though only to be stored, the\r\nduty must be paid, which it was thought was giving up the point.\r\n\r\nAnother consideration, which had great weight, was, the other\r\ncolonies were grown jealous of Boston, and thought it already\r\ndeficient in point of punctuality, against the dutied articles:\r\nand if the tea was once stored, artifices might be used, if not\r\nviolence, to disperse it abroad. But if through the continual\r\nvigilance and activity of the committee and the people, through a\r\nwhole winter, this should be prevented; yet one thing was certain,\r\nthat the tories would write to the other colonies and to England,\r\nthousands of falsehoods concerning it, in order to induce the\r\nministry to persevere, and to sow jealousies and create divisions\r\namong the colonies.\r\n\r\nOur acute logician then undertakes to prove the destruction of the\r\ntea unjustifiable, even upon the principle of the whigs, that the\r\nduty was unconstitutional. The only argument he uses is this: that\r\n\"unless we purchase the tea, we shall never pay the duty.\" This\r\nargument is so frivolous, and has been so often confuted and exposed,\r\nthat if the party had any other, I think they would relinquish this.\r\nWhere will it carry us? If a duty was laid upon our horses, we may\r\nwalk;--if upon our butcher's meat, we may live upon the produce of\r\nthe dairy;--and if that should be taxed, we may subsist as well\r\nas our fellow slaves in Ireland, upon spanish potatoes and cold\r\nwater. If a thousand pounds was laid upon the birth of every child,\r\nif children are not begotten, none will be born;--if, upon every\r\nmarriage, no duties will be paid, if all the young gentlemen and\r\nladies agree to live batchelors and maidens.\r\n\r\nIn order to form a rational judgment of the quality of this\r\ntransaction, and determine whether it was good or evil, we must go\r\nto the bottom of this great controversy. If parliament has a right\r\nto tax us and legislate for us, in all cases, the destruction of the\r\ntea was unjustifiable; but if the people of America are right in\r\ntheir principle, that parliament has no such right, that the act of\r\nparliament is null and void, and it is lawful to oppose and resist\r\nit, the question then is, whether the destruction was necessary?\r\nfor every principle of reason, justice and prudence, in such cases,\r\ndemands that the least mischief shall be done; the least evil among a\r\nnumber shall always be preferred.\r\n\r\nAll men are convinced that it was impracticable to return it, and\r\nrendered so by Mr. Hutchinson and the Boston consignees. Whether to\r\nhave stored it would have answered the end, or been a less mischief\r\nthan drowning it, I shall leave to the judgment of the public. The\r\nother colonies, it seems, have no scruples about it, for we find that\r\nwhenever tea arrives in any of them, whether from the East India\r\nCompany, or any other quarter, it never fails to share the fate of\r\nthat in Boston. All men will agree that such steps ought not to be\r\ntaken, but in cases of absolute necessity, and that such necessity\r\nmust be very clear. But most people in America now think, the\r\ndestruction of the Boston tea was absolutely necessary, and therefore\r\nright and just. It is very true, they say, if the whole people had\r\nbeen united in sentiment, and equally stable in their resolution, not\r\nto buy or drink it, there might have been a reason for preserving\r\nit; but the people here were not so virtuous or so happy. The\r\nBritish ministry had plundered the people by illegal taxes, and\r\napplied the money in salaries and pensions, by which devices, they\r\nhad insidiously attached to their party, no inconsiderable number of\r\npersons, some of whom were of family, fortune and influence, though\r\nmany of them were of desperate fortunes, each of whom, however,\r\nhad his circle of friends, connections and dependants, who were\r\ndetermined to drink tea, both as evidence of their servility to\r\nadministration, and their contempt and hatred of the people. These\r\nit was impossible to restrain without violence, perhaps bloodshed,\r\ncertainly without hazarding more than the tea was worth. To this\r\ntribe of the _wicked_, they say, must be added another, perhaps more\r\nnumerous, of the _weak_; who never could be brought to think of the\r\nconsequences of their actions, but would gratify their appetites,\r\nif they could come at the means. What numbers are there in every\r\ncommunity, who have no providence, or prudence in their private\r\naffairs, but will go on indulging the present appetite, prejudice,\r\nor passion, to the ruin of their estates and families, as well as\r\ntheir own health and characters! how much larger is the number of\r\nthose who have no foresight for the public, or consideration of the\r\nfreedom of posterity? Such an abstinence from the tea, as would have\r\navoided the establishment of a precedent, dependent on the unanimity\r\nof the people, was a felicity that was unattainable. Must the wise,\r\nthe virtuous and worthy part of the community, who constituted a very\r\ngreat majority, surrender their liberty, and involve their posterity\r\nin misery in complaisance to a detestable, though small party of\r\nknaves, and a despicable, though more numerous company of fools?\r\n\r\nIf Boston could have been treated like other places, like New York\r\nand Philadelphia, the tea might have gone home from thence, as it\r\ndid from those cities. That inveterate, desperate junto, to whom\r\nwe owe all our calamities, were determined to hurt us in this, as\r\nin all other cases, as much as they could. It is to be hoped they\r\nwill one day repent and be forgiven, but it is very hard to forgive\r\nwithout repentance. When the news of this event arrived in England,\r\nit excited such passions in the minister as nothing could restrain;\r\nhis resentment was inkindled into revenge, rage, and madness; his\r\nveracity was piqued, as his master piece of policy, proved but\r\na bubble. The bantling was the fruit of a favourite amour, and\r\nno wonder that his natural affection was touched, when he saw it\r\ndispatched before his eyes. His grief and ingenuity, if he had any,\r\nwere affected at the thought that he had misled the East India\r\nCompany so much nearer to destruction, and that he had rendered the\r\nbreach between the kingdom and the colonies almost irreconcilable:\r\nhis shame was excited because opposition had gained a triumph over\r\nhim, and the three kingdoms were laughing at him for his obstinacy\r\nand his blunders: instead of relieving the company he had hastened\r\nits ruin: instead of establishing the absolute and unlimited\r\nsovereignty of parliament over the colonies, he had excited a more\r\ndecisive denial of it, and resistance to it. An election drew nigh\r\nand he dreaded the resentment even of the corrupted electors.\r\n\r\nIn this state of mind bordering on despair, he determines to strike\r\na bold stroke. Bernard was near and did not fail to embrace the\r\nopportunity, to push the old systems of the junto. By attacking all\r\nthe colonies together, by the stamp-act, and the paint and glass act,\r\nthey had been defeated. The charter constitution of the Massachusetts\r\nBay, had contributed greatly to both these defeats. Their\r\nrepresentatives were too numerous, and too frequently elected, to be\r\ncorrupted: their people had been used to consider public affairs in\r\ntheir town meetings: their counsellors were not absolutely at the nod\r\nof a minister or governor, but were once a year equally dependant on\r\nthe governor and the two houses. Their grand jurors, were elective by\r\nthe people, their petit jurors were returned merely by lot. Bernard\r\nand the junto rightly judged, that by this constitution the people\r\nhad a check on every branch of power, and therefore as long as it\r\nlasted, parliamentary taxations, &c. could never be inforced.\r\n\r\nBernard, publishes his select letters, and his principles of polity;\r\nhis son writes in defence of the Quebec bill; hireling garretteers\r\nare employed to scribble millions of lies against us, in pamphlets\r\nand newspapers; and setters employed in the coffee houses, to\r\nchallenge or knock down all the advocates for the poor Massachusetts.\r\nIt was now determined, instead of attacking the colonies together,\r\nthough they had been all equally opposed to the plans of the ministry\r\nand the claims of parliament, and therefore upon ministerial\r\nprinciples equally guilty, to handle them one by one; and to begin\r\nwith Boston and the Massachusetts. The destruction of the tea was\r\na fine event for scribblers and speechifiers to declaim upon; and\r\nthere was an hereditary hatred of New England, in the minds of\r\nmany in England, on account of their non-conforming principles. It\r\nwas likewise thought there was a similar jealousy and animosity in\r\nthe other colonies against New England; that they would therefore\r\ncertainly desert her; that she would be intimidated and submit; and\r\nthen the minister, among his own friends, would acquire immortal\r\nhonour, as the most able, skilful and undaunted statesman of the age.\r\n\r\nThe port bill, charter bill, murder bill, Quebec bill, making\r\naltogether such a frightful system, as would have terrified any\r\npeople, who did not prefer liberty to life, were all concerted at\r\nonce; but all this art and violence have not succeeded. This people,\r\nunder great trials and dangers, have discovered great abilities\r\nand virtues, and that nothing is so terrible to them as the loss\r\nof their liberties. If these arts and violences are persisted in,\r\nand still greater concerted and carried on against them, the world\r\nwill see that their fortitude, patience and magnanimity will rise in\r\nproportion.\r\n\r\n\"Had Cromwell,\" says our what shall I call him? \"had the guidance\r\nof the national ire, your proud capital had been levelled with\r\nthe dust.\" Is it any breach of charity to suppose that such an\r\nevent as this, would have been a gratification to this writer? can\r\nwe otherwise account for his indulging himself in a thought so\r\ndiabolical? will he set up Cromwell as a model for his deified lords,\r\nBute, Mansfield and North? If he should, there is nothing in the\r\nwhole history of him so cruel as this. All his conduct in Ireland, as\r\nexceptionable as any part of his whole life, affords nothing that can\r\ngive the least probability to the idea of this writer. The rebellion\r\nin Ireland, was most obstinate, and of many years duration; 100,000\r\nProtestants had been murdered in a day, in cold blood, by Papists,\r\nand therefore Cromwell might plead some excuse, that cruel severities\r\nwere necessary, in order to restore any peace to that kingdom.\r\nBut all this will not justify him; for as has been observed by an\r\nhistorian, upon his conduct in this instance, \"men are not to divest\r\nthemselves of humanity, and turn themselves into devils, because\r\npolicy may suggest that they will succeed better as devils than as\r\nmen!\" But is there any parity or similitude between a rebellion\r\nof a dozen years standing, in which many battles had been fought,\r\nmany thousands fallen in war, and 100,000 massacred in a day; and\r\nthe drowning three cargoes of tea? To what strains of malevolence,\r\nto what flights of diabolical fury, is not tory rage capable of\r\ntransporting men!\r\n\r\n\"The whigs saw their ruin connected with a compliance with the terms\r\nof opening the port.\" They saw the ruin of their country connected\r\nwith such a compliance, and their own involved in it. But they might\r\nhave easily voted a compliance, for they were undoubtedly a vast\r\nmajority, and have enjoyed the esteem and affection of their fellow\r\nslaves to their last hours. Several of them could have paid for\r\nthe tea, and never have felt the loss. They knew they must suffer,\r\nvastly more, than the tea was worth; but they thought they acted for\r\nAmerica and posterity; and that they ought not to take such a step\r\nwithout the advice of the colonies. They have declared our cause\r\ntheir own--that they never will submit to a precedent in any part of\r\nthe united colonies, by which parliament may take away wharves and\r\nother lawful estates, or demolish charters; for if they do they have\r\na moral certainty that in the course of a few years, every right of\r\nAmericans will be taken away, and governors and councils, holding at\r\nthe will of a minister, will be the only legislatives in the colonies.\r\n\r\nA pompous account of the addressers of Mr. Hutchinson, then follows.\r\nThey consisted of his relations, his fellow labourers in the tory\r\nvineyard, and persons whom he had raised in the course of four\r\nadministrations, Shirley's, Pownal's, Bernard's, and his own, to\r\nplaces in the province. Considering the industry that was used,\r\nand the vast number of persons in the province, who had received\r\ncommissions under government upon his recommendation, the small\r\nnumber of subscribers that was obtained, is among a thousand\r\ndemonstrations of the unanimity of this people. If it had been\r\nthought worth while to have procured a remonstrance against him,\r\nfifty thousand subscribers might have been easily found. Several\r\ngentlemen of property were among these addressers, and some of fair\r\ncharacter; but their acquaintance and friendships lay among the\r\njunto and their subalterns entirely. Besides, did these addressers\r\napprove the policy or justice of any one of the bills, which were\r\npassed the last session of the late parliament? Did they acknowledge\r\nthe unlimited authority of parliament? The Middlesex magistrates\r\nremonstrated against taxation: but they were flattered with hopes,\r\nthat Mr. Hutchinson would get the port-bill, &c. repealed: that is,\r\nthat he would have undone all, which every one, but themselves, knew\r\nhe has been doing these fifteen years.\r\n\r\n\"But these patriotic endeavours, were defeated.\" By what? \"By an\r\ninvention of the fertile brain of one of our party agents, called a\r\ncommittee of correspondence.\" \"_This is the foulest, subtlest and\r\nmost venemous serpent, that ever issued from the eggs of sedition._\"\r\n\r\nI should rather call it, the _Ichneumon_, a very industrious, active\r\nand useful animal, which was worshipped in Egypt as a divinity,\r\nbecause it defended their country from the ravages of the crocodiles.\r\nIt was the whole occupation of this little creature to destroy those\r\nwily and ravenous monsters. It crushed their eggs, wherever they laid\r\nthem, and with a wonderful address and courage, would leap into their\r\nmouths, penetrate their entrails, and never leave until it destroyed\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIf the honour of this invention is due to the gentleman, who is\r\ngenerally understood by the \"party agent\" or Massachusettensis, it\r\nbelongs to one, to whom America has erected a statue in her heart,\r\nfor his integrity, fortitude and perseverance in her cause. That the\r\ninvention itself is very useful and important, is sufficiently clear,\r\nfrom the unlimited wrath of the tories against it, and from the\r\ngall which this writer discharges upon it. Almost all mankind have\r\nlost their liberties through ignorance, inattention and disunion.\r\nThese committees are admirably calculated to diffuse knowledge, to\r\ncommunicate intelligence, and promote unanimity. If the high whigs\r\nare generally of such committees, it is because the freeholders, who\r\nchoose them, are such, and therefore prefer their peers. The tories,\r\nhigh or low, if they can make interest enough among the people, may\r\nget themselves chosen, and promote the great cause of parliamentary\r\nrevenues, and the other sublime doctrines and mysteries of toryism.\r\nThat these committees think themselves \"amenable to none,\" is false;\r\nfor there is not a man upon any one of them, who does not acknowledge\r\nhimself to hold his place, at the pleasure of his constituents, and\r\nto be accountable to them, whenever they demand it. If the committee\r\nof the town of Boston was appointed, for a special purpose at first,\r\ntheir commission has been renewed from time to time; they have been\r\nfrequently thanked by the town for their vigilance, activity and\r\ndisinterested labours in the public service. Their doings have been\r\nlaid before the town and approved of by it. The malice of the tories\r\nhas several times swelled open their bosoms, and broke out into the\r\nmost intemperate and illiberal invectives against it; but all in\r\nvain. It has only served to shew the impotence of the tories, and\r\nincrease the importance of the committee.\r\n\r\nThese committees cannot be too religiously careful of the exact\r\ntruth of the intelligence they receive or convey; nor too anxious\r\nfor the rectitude and purity of the measures they propose or adopt;\r\nthey should be very sure that they do no injury to any man's person,\r\nproperty or character; and they are generally persons of such worth,\r\nthat I have no doubt of their attention to these rules; and therefore\r\nthat the reproaches of this writer are mere slanders.\r\n\r\nIf we recollect how many states have lost their liberties, merely\r\nfrom want of communication with each other, and union among\r\nthemselves, we shall think that these committees may be intended by\r\nProvidence to accomplish great events. What the eloquence and talents\r\nof negociation of Demosthenes himself could not effect, among the\r\nstates of Greece, might have been effected by so simple a device.\r\nCastile, Arragon, Valencia, Majorca, &c. all complained of oppression\r\nunder Charles the fifth, flew out into transports of rage, and took\r\narms against him. But they never consulted or communicated with each\r\nother. They resisted separately, and were separately subdued. Had Don\r\nJuan Padilla, or his wife, been possessed of the genius to invent a\r\ncommittee of correspondence, perhaps the liberties of the Spanish\r\nnation might have remained to this hour, without any necessity to\r\nhave had recourse to arms. Hear the opinion of Dr. Robertson. \"While\r\nthe spirit of disaffection was so general among the Spaniards, and\r\nso many causes concurred in precipitating them into such violent\r\nmeasures, in order to obtain redress of their grievances, it may\r\nappear strange that the malecontents in the different kingdoms should\r\nhave carried on their operations without any mutual concert or even\r\nany intercourse with each other. By uniting their councils and arms,\r\nthey might have acted both with greater force, and with more effect.\r\nThe appearance of a national confederacy would have rendered it no\r\nless respectable among the people, than formidable to the crown; and\r\nthe emperor, unable to resist such a combination, must have complied\r\nwith any terms, which the members of it thought fit to prescribe.\"\r\n\r\nThat it is owing to those committees that so many persons have been\r\nfound to recant and resign, and so many others to fly to the army,\r\nis a mistake; for the same things would have taken place, if such a\r\ncommittee had never been in being, and such persons would probably\r\nhave met with much rougher usage. This writer asks, \"have not these\r\npersons as good a right to think and act for themselves as the\r\nwhigs?\" I answer yes. But if any man, whig or tory, shall take it\r\ninto his head to think for himself, that he has a right to take my\r\nproperty, without my consent; however tender I may be of the right of\r\nprivate judgment and the freedom of thought, this is a point in which\r\nI shall be very likely to differ from him, and to think for myself,\r\nthat I have a right to resist him. If any man should think, ever\r\nso conscientiously that the Roman Catholic religion is better than\r\nthe Protestant, or that the French government is preferable to the\r\nBritish constitution in its purity; Protestants and Britons, will not\r\nbe so tender of that man's conscience as to suffer him to introduce\r\nhis favourite religion and government. So the well bred gentlemen,\r\nwho are so polite as to think, that the charter constitution of\r\nthis province ought to be abolished, and another introduced, wholly\r\nat the will of a minister or the crown; or that our ecclesiastical\r\nconstitution is bad, and high church ought to come in, few people\r\nwill be so tender of these consciences or complaisant to such\r\npolite taste, as to suffer the one or the other to be established.\r\nThere are certain prejudices among the people, so strong, as to be\r\nirresistible. Reasoning is vain, and opposition idle. For example,\r\nthere are certain popular maxims and precepts called the ten\r\ncommandments. Suppose a number of fine gentlemen, superior to the\r\nprejudices of education, should discover that these were made for the\r\ncommon people, and are too illiberal for gentlemen of refined taste\r\nto observe; and accordingly should engage in secret confidential\r\ncorrespondences to procure an act of parliament, to abolish the whole\r\ndecalogue, or to exempt them from all obligation to observe it. If\r\nthey should succeed, and their letters be detected, such is the force\r\nof prejudice, and deep habits among the lower sort of people, that\r\nit is much to be questioned, whether those refined geniuses would\r\nbe allowed to enjoy themselves in the latitude of their sentiments.\r\nI once knew a man, who had studied Jacob Beckman and other mystics\r\nuntil he conscientiously thought the millenium commenced, and all\r\nhuman authority at an end; that the saints only had a right to\r\nproperty, and to take from sinners any thing they wanted. In this\r\npersuasion, he very honestly stole a horse. Mankind pitied the poor\r\nman's infirmity, but thought it however their duty to confine him\r\nthat he might steal no more.\r\n\r\nThe freedom of thinking was never yet extended in any country so far,\r\nas the utter subversion of all religion and morality; nor as the\r\nabolition of the laws and constitution of the country.\r\n\r\nBut \"are not these persons as closely connected with the interest\r\nof their country as the whigs?\" I answer, they are not: they have\r\nfound an interest in opposition to that of their country, and are\r\nmaking themselves rich and their families illustrious, by depressing\r\nand destroying their country. But \"do not their former lives and\r\nconversations appear to have been regulated by principles, as much as\r\nthose of the whigs?\" A few of them, it must be acknowledged, until\r\nseduced by the bewitching charms of wealth and power, appeared to be\r\nmen of principle. But taking the whigs and tories on an average, the\r\nbalance of principle, as well as genius, learning, wit and wealth, is\r\ninfinitely in favour of the former. As to some of these fugitives,\r\nthey are known to be men of no principles at all, in religion, morals\r\nor government.\r\n\r\nBut the \"policy\" is questioned, and you are asked if you expect to\r\nmake converts by it? As to the policy or impolicy of it, I have\r\nnothing to say; but we do not expect to make converts of most of\r\nthose persons by any means whatever, as long as they have any hopes\r\nthat the ministry will place and pension them. The instant these\r\nhopes are extinguished, we all know they will be converted of course.\r\nConverts from places and pensions are only to be made by places and\r\npensions; all other reasoning is idle; these are the _penultima\r\nratio_ of the tories, as field pieces are the _ultima_.\r\n\r\nThat we are not \"unanimous is certain.\" But there are nineteen on one\r\nside to one on the other, through the province; and ninety-nine, out\r\nof an hundred of the remaining twentieth part, can be fairly shewn\r\nto have some sinister private view, to induce them to profess his\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\nThen we are threatened high, that \"this is a changeable world, and\r\ntimes rolling wheel may ere long bring them uppermost, and in that\r\ncase we should not wish to have them fraught with resentment.\"\r\n\r\nTo all this we answer, without ceremony, that they always have been\r\nuppermost, in every respect, excepting only the esteem and affection\r\nof the people; that they always have been fraught with resentment\r\n(even their cunning and policy have not restrained them) and we know\r\nthey always will be; that they have indulged their resentment and\r\nmalice, in every instance in which they had power to do it; and we\r\nknow that their revenge will never have other limits, than their\r\npower.\r\n\r\nThen this consistent writer, begins to flatter the people; \"he\r\nappeals to their good sense, he knows they have it;\" the same people,\r\nwhom he has so many times represented as mad and foolish.\r\n\r\n\"I know you are loyal and friends to good order.\" This is the\r\nsame people that, in the whole course of his writings, he has\r\nrepresented as continuing for ten years together in a continual\r\nstate of disorder, demolishing the chair, board, supreme court, and\r\nencouraging all sorts of riots, insurrections, treason and rebellion.\r\nSuch are the shifts to which a man is driven, when he aims at\r\ncarrying a point, not at discovering truth.\r\n\r\nThe people are then told that \"they have been insidiously taught to\r\nbelieve that Great Britain is rapacious, cruel and vindictive, and\r\nenvies us the inheritance purchased by the sweat and blood of our\r\nancestors.\" The people do not believe this--they will not believe it.\r\nOn the contrary, they believe, if it was not for scandals constantly\r\ntransmitted from this province by the tories, the nation would\r\nredress our grievances. Nay as little as they reverence the ministry,\r\nthey even believe that the lords North, Mansfield and Bute would\r\nrelieve them, and would have done it long ago, if they had known\r\nthe truth. The moment this is done \"long live our gracious king and\r\nhappiness to Britain,\" will resound from one end of the province to\r\nthe other; but it requires a very little foresight to determine, that\r\nno other plan of governing the province and the colonies will ever\r\nrestore a harmony between the two countries, but desisting from the\r\nplan of taxing them and interfering with their internal concerns,\r\nand returning to that system of colony administration, which nature\r\ndictated, and experience for one hundred and fifty years found useful.\r\n\r\nNOVANGLUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESSED\r\n\r\n_To the Inhabitants of the Colony of Massachusetts Bay_,\r\n\r\nMarch 6, 1775.\r\n\r\n\r\nMY FRIENDS,\r\n\r\nOur rhetorical magician, in his paper of January the 9th continues\r\nto _wheedle_. \"You want nothing but to know the true state of facts,\r\nto rectify whatever is amiss.\" He becomes an advocate for the poor\r\nof Boston! Is for making great allowance for the whigs. \"The whigs\r\nare too valuable a part of the community to lose. He would not draw\r\ndown the vengeance of Great Britain. He shall become an advocate for\r\nthe leading whigs.\" &c. It is in vain for us to enquire after the\r\n_sincerity_ or _consistency_ of all this. It is agreeable to the\r\nprecept of Horace. _Irritat, mulcet, falsis terroribus implet, ut\r\nmagus._ And that is all he desires.\r\n\r\nAfter a long discourse, which has nothing in it, but what has been\r\nanswered already, he comes to a great subject indeed, the British\r\nconstitution; and undertakes to prove that \"the authority of\r\nparliament extends to the colonies.\"\r\n\r\nWhy will not this writer state the question fairly? The whigs\r\nallow that from the necessity of a case not provided for by common\r\nlaw, and to supply a defect in the British dominions, which there\r\nundoubtedly is, if they are to be governed only by that law, America\r\nhas all along consented, still consents, and ever will consent, that\r\nparliament being the most powerful legislature in the dominions,\r\nshould regulate the trade of the dominions. This is founding the\r\nauthority of parliament to regulate our trade, upon _compact_\r\nand _consent_ of the colonies, not upon any principle of common\r\nor statute law, not upon any original principle of the English\r\nconstitution, not upon the principle that parliament is the supreme\r\nand sovereign legislature over them in all cases whatsoever.\r\n\r\nThe question is not therefore, whether the authority of parliament\r\nextends to the colonies in any case; for it is admitted by the whigs\r\nthat it does in that of commerce: but whether it extends in all cases.\r\n\r\nWe are then detained with a long account of the three simple forms of\r\ngovernment; and are told that \"the British constitution consisting of\r\nking, lords and commons, is formed upon the principles of monarchy,\r\naristocracy and democracy, in due proportion; that it includes the\r\nprincipal excellencies, and excludes the principal defects of the\r\nother kinds of government--the most perfect system that the wisdom\r\nof ages has produced, and Englishmen glory in being subject to and\r\nprotected by it.\"\r\n\r\nThen we are told, \"that the colonies are a part of the British\r\nempire.\" But what are we to understand by this? Some of the colonies,\r\nmost of them indeed, were settled before the kingdom of Great Britain\r\nwas brought into existence. The union of England and Scotland, was\r\nmade and established by act of parliament in the reign of queen\r\nAnn; and it was this union and statute which erected the kingdom\r\nof Great Britain. The colonies were settled long before, in the\r\nreigns of the Jameses and Charleses. What authority over them had\r\nScotland? Scotland, England, and the colonies were all under one\r\nking before that; the two crowns of England and Scotland, united on\r\nthe head of James the first, and continued united on that of Charles\r\nthe first, when our first charter was granted. Our charter being\r\ngranted by him, who was king of both nations, to our ancestors, most\r\nof whom were _post nati_, born after the union of the two crowns,\r\nand consequently, as was adjudged in Calvin's case, free, natural\r\nsubjects of Scotland, as well as England; had not the king as good\r\na right to have governed the colonies by his Scottish, as by his\r\nEnglish parliament, and to have granted our charters under the seal\r\nof Scotland, as well as that of England?\r\n\r\nBut to wave this. If the English parliament were to govern us, where\r\ndid they get the right, without our consent to take the Scottish\r\nparliament into a participation of the government over us? When this\r\nwas done, was the American share of the democracy of the constitution\r\nconsulted? If not, were not the Americans deprived of the benefit of\r\nthe democratical part of the constitution? And is not the democracy\r\nas essential to the English constitution, as the monarchy or\r\naristocracy? Should we have been more effectually deprived of the\r\nbenefit of the British or English constitution, if one or both houses\r\nof parliament, or if our house and council had made this union with\r\nthe two houses of parliament in Scotland, without the king?\r\n\r\nIf a new constitution was to be formed for the whole British\r\ndominions, and a supreme legislature coextensive with it, upon the\r\ngeneral principles of the English constitution, an equal mixture\r\nof monarchy, aristocracy and democracy, let us see what would be\r\nnecessary. England had six millions of people we will say: America\r\nhad three. England has five hundred members in the house of commons\r\nwe will say: America must have two hundred and fifty. Is it possible\r\nshe should maintain them there, or could they at such a distance\r\nknow the state, the sense or exigencies of their constituents?\r\nIreland, too, must be incorporated, and send another hundred or two\r\nof members. The territory in the East Indies and West India Islands\r\nmust send members. And after all this, every navigation act, every\r\nact of trade must be repealed. America and the East and West Indies\r\nand Africa too must have equal liberty to trade with all the world,\r\nthat the favoured inhabitants of Great Britain have now. Will the\r\nministry thank Massachusettensis for becoming an advocate for such\r\nan union and incorporation of all the dominions of the king of Great\r\nBritain? Yet without such an union, a legislature which shall be\r\nsovereign and supreme in all cases whatsoever, and coextensive with\r\nthe empire, can never be established upon the general principles\r\nof the English constitution, which Massachusettensis lays down,\r\nviz. an equal mixture of monarchy, aristocracy and democracy. Nay\r\nfurther, in order to comply with this principle, this new government,\r\nthis mighty Colossus, which is to bestride the narrow world, must\r\nhave an house of lords consisting of Irish, East and West Indian,\r\nAfrican, American, as well as English and Scottish noblemen; for the\r\nnobility ought to be scattered about all the dominions, as well as\r\nthe representatives of the commons. If in twenty years more America\r\nshould have six millions of inhabitants, as there is a boundless\r\nterritory to fill up, she must have five hundred representatives.\r\nUpon these principles, if in forty years she should have twelve\r\nmillions, a thousand; and if the inhabitants of the three kingdoms\r\nremain as they are, being already full of inhabitants, what will\r\nbecome of your supreme legislative? It will be translated, crown\r\nand all, to America. This is a sublime system for America. It will\r\nflatter those ideas of independency, which the tories impute to them,\r\nif they have any such, more than any other plan of independency that\r\nI have ever heard projected.\r\n\r\n\"The best writers upon the law of nations, tell us, that when a\r\nnation takes possession of a distant country and settles there,\r\nthat country, though separated from the principal establishment, or\r\nmother country, naturally becomes a part of the state, equal with\r\nits ancient possessions.\" We are not told who these \"best writers\"\r\nare: I think we ought to be introduced to them. But their meaning\r\nmay be no more, than that it is best they should be incorporated\r\nwith the ancient establishment by contract, or by some new law\r\nand institution, by which the new country shall have equal right,\r\npowers and privileges, as well as equal protection; and be under\r\nequal obligations of obedience with the old. Has there been any such\r\ncontract between Britain and the colonies? Is America incorporated\r\ninto the realm? Is it a part of the realm? Is it a part of the\r\nkingdom? Has it any share in the legislative of the realm? The\r\nconstitution requires that every foot of land should be represented\r\nin the third estate, the democratical branch of the constitution.\r\nHow many millions of acres in America, how many thousands of wealthy\r\nlandholders, have no representatives there.\r\n\r\nBut let these \"best writers\" say what they will, there is nothing in\r\nthe law of nations, which is only the law of right reason, applied\r\nto the conduct of nations, that requires that emigrants from a state\r\nthat should continue, or be made a part of the state.\r\n\r\nThe practice of nations has been different. The Greeks planted\r\ncolonies, and neither demanded nor pretended any authority over them,\r\nbut they became distinct independent commonwealths.\r\n\r\nThe Romans continued their colonies under the jurisdiction of\r\nthe mother commonwealth; but, nevertheless, she allowed them the\r\nprivileges of cities. Indeed that sagacious city seems to have been\r\naware of difficulties, similar to those, under which Great Britain is\r\nnow labouring; she seems to have been sensible of the impossibility\r\nof keeping colonies, planted at great distances, under the absolute\r\ncontroul of her _senatus consulta_. Harrington tells us, Oceana p.\r\n43. that \"the commonwealth of Rome, by planting colonies of its\r\ncitizens within the bounds of Italy, took the best way of propagating\r\nitself, and naturalizing the country; whereas if it had planted such\r\ncolonies without the bounds of Italy, it would have alienated the\r\ncitizens, and given a root to liberty abroad, that might have sprung\r\nup foreign, or savage and hostile to her; _wherefore it never made\r\nany such dispersion of itself and its strength_, till it was under\r\nthe yoke of the emperors, who disburdening themselves of the people,\r\nas having less apprehension of what they could do abroad than at\r\nhome, took a contrary course.\" But these Italian cities, although\r\nestablished by decrees of the senate of Rome, to which the colonist\r\nwas always party, either as a Roman citizen about to emigrate, or as\r\na conquered enemy treating upon terms; were always allowed all the\r\nrights of Roman citizens, and were governed by senates of their own.\r\nIt was the policy of Rome to conciliate her colonies, by allowing\r\nthem equal liberties with her citizens. Witness the example of the\r\nPrivernates. This people had been conquered, and complaining of\r\noppressions, revolted. At last they sent ambassadors to Rome to treat\r\nof peace. The senate was divided in opinion. Some were for violent,\r\nothers for lenient measures. In the course of the debate, a senator,\r\nwhose opinion was for _bringing them to his feet_, proudly asked\r\none of the ambassadors, what punishment he thought his countrymen\r\ndeserved? _Eam inquit, quam merentur, qui se libertate dignos\r\ncensent._ That punishment which those deserve, who think themselves\r\nworthy of liberty. Another senator, seeing that the _ministerial\r\nmembers_ were exasperated with the honest answer, in order to divert\r\ntheir anger, asks another question. What if we remit all punishment?\r\nWhat kind of a peace may we hope for with you? _Si bonam dederitis,\r\ninquit et fidam, et perpetuam; si malam, haud diuturnam._ If you give\r\nus a just peace, it will be faithfully observed, and perpetually:\r\nbut if a bad one, it will not last long. The _ministerial_ senators\r\nwere all on fire at this answer, cried out sedition and rebellion;\r\nbut the wiser majority decreed, \"_viri et liberi, vocem auditam, an\r\ncredi posse, ullum populum, aut hominem denique, in ea conditione,\r\ncujus cum paeniteat, diutius, quam necesse sit, mansurum? Ibi pacem\r\nesse fidam, ubi voluntarii pacati sint; neque eo loco, ubi servitutem\r\nesse velint, fidem sperandam esse._\" \"That they had heard the voice\r\nof a man and a son of liberty; that it was not natural or credible\r\nthat any people, or any man, would continue longer than necessity\r\nshould compel him, in a condition that grieved and displeased him.\r\nA faithful peace was to be expected from men whose affections were\r\nconciliated, nor was any kind of fidelity to be expected from\r\nslaves.\" The consul exclaimed, \"_Eos demum qui nihil, praeterquam de\r\nlibertate, existent, dignos esse qui Romani fiant._\" That they who\r\nregarded nothing so much as their liberty, deserved to be Romans.\r\n\"_Itaque et in senatu causam obtinuere, et ex auctoritate patrum,\r\nlatum ad populum est, ut Privernatibus civitas daretur._\" Therefore\r\nthe Privernates obtained their cause in the senate, and it was by\r\nthe authority of those fathers, recommended to the people, that\r\nthe privileges of a city should be granted them. The practice of\r\nfree nations only can be adduced, as precedents of what the law of\r\nnature has been thought to dictate upon this subject of colonies.\r\nTheir practice is different. The senate and people of Rome did not\r\ninterfere commonly by making laws for their colonies, but left them\r\nto be ruled by their governors and senates. Can Massachusettensis\r\nproduce from the whole history of Rome, or from the Digest, one\r\nexample of a _Senatus consultum_ or a _Plebiscitum_ laying taxes on\r\nthe colony?\r\n\r\nHaving mentioned the wisdom of the Romans, for not planting colonies\r\nout of Italy, and their reasons for it, I cannot help recollecting\r\nan observation of Harrington, Oceana, p. 44. \"For the colonies in\r\nthe Indies,\" says he, \"they are yet babes, that cannot live without\r\nsucking the breasts of their mother cities; but such as I mistake,\r\nif, when they come of age, they do not wean themselves, which causes\r\nme to wonder at princes that delight to be exhausted that way.\" This\r\nwas written 120 years ago; the colonies are now nearer manhood than\r\never Harrington foresaw they would arrive, in such a period of time.\r\nIs it not astonishing then, that any British minister should ever\r\nhave considered this subject so little, as to believe it possible\r\nfor him to new model all our governments, to tax us by an authority\r\nthat never taxed us before, and subdue us to an implicit obedience to\r\na legislature, that millions of us scarcely ever thought any thing\r\nabout?\r\n\r\nI have said, that the practice of free governments alone can be\r\nquoted with propriety, to shew the sense of nations. But the sense\r\nand practice of nations is not enough. Their practice must be\r\nreasonable, just and right, or it will not govern Americans.\r\n\r\nAbsolute monarchies, whatever their practice may be, are nothing to\r\nus. For as Harrington observes, \"Absolute monarchy, as that of the\r\nTurks, neither plants its people at home nor abroad, otherwise than\r\nas tenants for life or at will; wherefore its national and provincial\r\ngovernment is all one.\"\r\n\r\nI deny, therefore, that the practice of free nations, or the opinions\r\nof the best writers upon the law of nations, will warrant the\r\nposition of Massachusettensis, that when a nation takes possession\r\nof a distant territory, that becomes a part of the state equally\r\nwith its ancient possessions. The practice of free nations, and the\r\nopinions of the best writers, are in general on the contrary.\r\n\r\nI agree, that \"two supreme and independent authorities cannot exist\r\nin the same state,\" any more than two supreme beings in one universe.\r\nAnd therefore I contend, that our provincial legislatures are the\r\nonly supreme authorities in our colonies. Parliament, notwithstanding\r\nthis, may be allowed an authority supreme and sovereign over the\r\nocean, which may be limited by the banks of the ocean, or the bounds\r\nof our charters; our charters give us no authority over the high\r\nseas. Parliament has our consent to assume a jurisdiction over them.\r\nAnd here is a line fairly drawn between the rights of Britain and\r\nthe rights of the colonies, viz. the banks of the ocean, or low\r\nwater mark; the line of division between common law and civil, or\r\nmaritime law. If this is not sufficient--if parliament are at a loss\r\nfor any principle of natural, civil, maritime, moral or common law,\r\non which to ground any authority over the high seas, the Atlantic\r\nespecially, let the Colonies be treated like reasonable creatures,\r\nand they will discover great ingenuity and modesty. The acts of trade\r\nand navigation might be confirmed by provincial laws, and carried\r\ninto execution by our own courts and juries, and in this case illicit\r\ntrade would be cut up by the roots forever. I knew the smuggling\r\ntories in New-York and Boston would cry out against this, because\r\nit would not only destroy their profitable game of smuggling, but\r\ntheir whole place and pension system. But the whigs, that is a vast\r\nmajority of the whole continent, would not regard the smuggling\r\ntories. In one word, if public principles and motives and arguments,\r\nwere alone to determine this dispute between the two countries,\r\nit might be settled forever, in a few hours; but the everlasting\r\nclamours of prejudice, passion and private interest, drown every\r\nconsideration of that sort, and are precipitating us into a civil war.\r\n\r\n\"If then we are a part of the British empire, we must be subject to\r\nthe supreme power of the state, which is vested in the estates in\r\nparliament.\"\r\n\r\nHere again we are to be conjured out of our senses by the magic in\r\nthe words \"British empire,\" and \"supreme power of the state.\" But\r\nhowever it may sound, I say we are not a part of the British empire;\r\nbecause the British government is not an empire. The governments of\r\nFrance, Spain, &c. are not empires, but monarchies, supposed to be\r\ngoverned by fixed fundamental laws, though not really. The British\r\ngovernment is still less intitled to the style of an empire: it is\r\na limited monarchy. If Aristotle, Livy, and Harrington knew what a\r\nrepublic was, the British constitution is much more like a republic,\r\nthan an empire. They define a republic to be _a government of laws,\r\nand not of men_. If this definition is just, the British constitution\r\nis nothing more nor less than a republic, in which the king is first\r\nmagistrate. This office being hereditary and being possessed of such\r\nample and splendid prerogatives, is no objection to the government's\r\nbeing a republic, as long as it is bound by fixed laws, which the\r\npeople have a voice in making, and a right to defend. An empire is a\r\ndespotism, and an emperor a despot, bound by no law or imitation, but\r\nhis own will: it is a stretch of tyranny beyond absolute monarchy.\r\nFor although the will of an absolute monarch is law, yet his edicts\r\nmust be registered by parliaments. Even this formality is not\r\nnecessary in an empire. There the maxim is _quod principi placuit,\r\nlegis habet vigorem_, even without having that will and pleasure\r\nrecorded. There are but three empires now in Europe, the German, or\r\nholy Roman, the Russian and the Ottoman.\r\n\r\nThere is another sense indeed, in which the word empire is used, in\r\nwhich it may be applied to the government of Geneva, or any other\r\nrepublic, as well as to monarchy, or despotism. In this sense it is\r\nsynonimous with government, rule, or dominion. In this sense, we are\r\nwithin the dominion, rule, or government of the king of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nThe question should be, whether we are a part of the kingdom of Great\r\nBritain: this is the only language, known in English laws. We are not\r\nthen a part of the British kingdom, realm or state; and therefore\r\nthe supreme power of the kingdom, realm or state, is not upon these\r\nprinciples, the supreme power of us. That \"supreme power over America\r\nis vested in the estates in parliament,\" is an affront to us; for\r\nthere is not an acre of American land represented there--there are no\r\nAmerican estates in parliament.\r\n\r\nTo say that we \"must be\" subject, seems, to betray a consciousness,\r\nthat we are not by any law or upon any principles, but those of mere\r\npower; and an opinion that we ought to be or that it is necessary\r\nthat we should be. But if this should be, admitted, for argument's\r\nsake only, what is the consequence? The consequences that may fairly\r\nbe drawn are these:--That Britain has been imprudent enough to let\r\ncolonies be planted, until they are become numerous and important,\r\nwithout ever having wisdom enough to concert a plan for their\r\ngovernment, consistent with her own welfare: that now it is necessary\r\nto make them submit to the authority of parliament: and because\r\nthere is no principle of law or justice, or reason, by which she can\r\neffect it; therefore she will resort to war and conquest--to the\r\nmaxim _delenda est Carthago_. These are the consequences, according\r\nto this writer's idea. We think the consequences are, that she has\r\nafter 150 years, discovered a defect in her government, which ought\r\nto be supplied by some just and reasonable means; that is, by the\r\nconsent of the colonies; for metaphysicians and politicians may\r\ndispute forever, but they will never find any other moral principle\r\nor foundation of rule or obedience, than the consent of governors\r\nand governed. She has found out that the great machine will not go\r\nany longer without a new wheel. She will make this herself. We think\r\nshe is making it of such materials and workmanship as will tear the\r\nwhole machine to pieces. We are willing if she can convince us of\r\nthe necessity of such a wheel, to assist with artists and materials,\r\nin making it, so that it may answer the end. But she says, we shall\r\nhave no share in it; and if we will not let her patch it up as she\r\npleases, her Massachusettensis and other advocates tell us, she will\r\ntear it to pieces herself, by cutting our throats. To this kind of\r\nreasoning we can only answer, that we will not stand still to be\r\nbutchered. We will defend our lives as long as providence shall\r\nenable us.\r\n\r\n\"It is beyond doubt, that it was the sense both of the _parent\r\ncountry_ and _our ancestors_, that they were to remain subject to\r\nparliament.\"\r\n\r\nThis has been often asserted, and as often contradicted, and fully\r\nconfuted. The confutation may not, however, have come to every eye\r\nwhich has read this newspaper.\r\n\r\nThe public acts of kings and ministers of state, in that age, when\r\nour ancestors emigrated, which were not complained of, remonstrated\r\nand protested against by the commons, are looked upon as sufficient\r\nproof of the \"sense\" of the parent country.\r\n\r\nThe charter to the treasurer and company of Virginia, 23d March,\r\n1609, grants ample power of government, legislative, executive and\r\njudicial, and then contains an express covenant \"to and with the\r\nsaid treasurer and company, their successors, factors and assigns,\r\nthat they, and every of them, shall be free from all taxes and\r\nimpositions forever, upon any goods or merchandizes, at any time or\r\ntimes hereafter, either upon importation thither, or exportation from\r\nthence, into our realm of England, or into any other of our realms or\r\ndominions.\"\r\n\r\nI agree with this writer, that the authority of a supreme\r\nlegislature, includes the right of taxation. Is not this quotation\r\nthen an irresistible proof, that \"it was not the sense of king James\r\nor his ministers, or of the ancestors of the Virginians, that they\r\nwere to remain subject to parliament as a supreme legislature?\"\r\n\r\nAfter this, James issued a proclamation, recalling the patent, but\r\nthis was never regarded. Then Charles issued another proclamation,\r\nwhich produced a remonstrance from Virginia, which was answered\r\nby a letter from the lords of the privy council, 22d July, 1634,\r\ncontaining the royal assurance that \"all their estates, trade,\r\nfreedom, and privileges should be enjoyed by them, in as extensive a\r\nmanner, as they enjoyed them before those proclamations.\"\r\n\r\nHere is another evidence of the sense of the king and his ministers.\r\n\r\nAfterwards parliament sent a squadron of ships to Virginia; the\r\ncolony rose in open resistance until the parliamentary commissioners\r\ngranted them conditions, that they should enjoy the privileges of\r\nEnglishmen; that their assembly should transact the affairs of the\r\ncolonies; that they should have a free trade to all places and\r\nnations, as the people of England; and fourthly, that \"Virginia\r\nshall be free from all _taxes_, customs, and impositions whatever,\r\nand none shall be imposed on them without consent of their general\r\nassembly; and that neither forts nor castles be erected, or garrisons\r\nmaintained, without their consent.\"\r\n\r\nOne would think this was evidence enough of the sense both of the\r\nparent country and our ancestors.\r\n\r\nAfter the acts of navigation were passed, Virginia sent agents\r\nto England, and a remonstrance against those acts. Charles, in\r\nanswer, sent a declaration under the privy seal, 19th April, 1676,\r\naffirming, \"that taxes ought not to be laid upon the inhabitants and\r\nproprietors of the colony, but by the common consent of the general\r\nassembly; except such impositions as the parliament should lay on the\r\ncommodities imported into England from the colony.\" And he ordered a\r\ncharter, under the great seal, to secure this right to the Virginians.\r\n\r\nWhat becomes of the \"sense\" of the parent country and our ancestors?\r\nfor the ancestors of the Virginians are our ancestors, when we speak\r\nof ourselves as Americans. From Virginia let us pass to Maryland.\r\nCharles 1st, in 1633, gave a charter to the baron of Baltimore,\r\ncontaining ample powers of government, and this express covenant: \"to\r\nand with the said lord Baltimore, his heirs and assigns, that we, our\r\nheirs and successors, shall at no time hereafter, set or make, or\r\ncause to be set any imposition, custom, or other taxation, rate, or\r\ncontribution whatsoever, in and upon the dwellings and inhabitants\r\nof the aforesaid province, for their lands, tenements, goods or\r\nchattels, within the said province; or to be laden or unladen, within\r\nthe ports or harbours of the said province.\"\r\n\r\nWhat then was the \"sense\" of the parent country, and the ancestors\r\nof Maryland? But if by \"our ancestors,\" he confines his idea to\r\nNew England or this province, let us consider. The first planters\r\nof Plymouth were our ancestors in the strictest sense. They had\r\nno charter or patent for the land they took possession of, and\r\nderived no authority from the English parliament or crown, to set\r\nup their government. They purchased land of the Indians, and set\r\nup a government of their own, on the simple principle of nature,\r\nand afterwards purchased a patent for the land of the council at\r\nPlymouth, but never purchased any charter for government of the\r\ncrown, or the king, and continued to exercise all the powers of\r\ngovernment, legislative, executive and judicial, upon the plain\r\nground of an original contract among independent individuals for\r\n68 years, i.e. until their incorporation with Massachusetts by our\r\npresent charter. The same may be said of the colonies which emigrated\r\nto Say-Brook, New-Haven, and other parts of Connecticut. They seem to\r\nhave had no idea of dependence on parliament, any more than on the\r\nconclave. The secretary of Connecticut has now in his possession,\r\nan original letter from Charles 2d. to that colony, in which he\r\nconsiders them rather as friendly allies, than as subjects to his\r\nEnglish parliament, and even requests them to pass a law in their\r\nassembly relative to piracy.\r\n\r\nThe sentiments of your ancestors in the Massachusetts, may be learned\r\nfrom almost every ancient paper and record. It would be endless\r\nto recite all the passages, in which it appears that they thought\r\nthemselves exempt from the authority of parliament, not only in\r\nthe point of taxation, but in all cases whatsoever. Let me mention\r\none. Randolph, one of the predecessors of Massachusettensis, in a\r\nrepresentation to Charles 2d. dated 20th September, 1676, says, \"I\r\nwent to visit the governor at his house, and among other discourse, I\r\ntold him I took notice of several ships that were arrived at Boston,\r\nsome since my being there, from Spain, France, Streights, Canaries,\r\nand other parts of Europe, contrary to your majesty's laws for\r\nencouraging navigation and regulating the trade of the plantations.\"\r\nHe freely declared to me, that the law made by your majesty and your\r\nparliament, obligeth them in nothing but what consists with the\r\ninterest of that colony, that the legislative power is and abides in\r\nthem solely to act and make laws by virtue of a charter from your\r\nmajesty's royal father. Here is a positive assertion of an exemption\r\nfrom the authority of parliament, even in the case of the regulation\r\nof trade.\r\n\r\nAfterwards in 1677, the general court passed a law, which shews the\r\nsense of our ancestors in a very strong light. It is in these words.\r\n\"This court being informed, by letters received this day from our\r\nmessengers, of his majesty's expectation that the acts of Trade and\r\nNavigation be exactly and punctually observed by this his majesty's\r\ncolony, his pleasure therein not having before now, signified unto\r\nus, either by express from his majesty, or any of his ministers\r\nof state; It is therefore hereby ordered, and by the authority of\r\nthis court enacted, that henceforth, all masters of ships, ketches,\r\nor other vessels, of greater or lesser burthen, arriving in, or\r\nsailing from any of the ports in this jurisdiction, do, without\r\ncoven, or fraud, yield faithful and constant obedience unto, and\r\nobservation of all the said acts, of navigation and trade, on penalty\r\nof suffering such forfeitures, loss and damage as in the said acts\r\nare particularly expressed. And the governor and council, and all\r\nofficers commissionated and authorised by them, are hereby ordered\r\nand required to see to the strict observation of the said acts.\" As\r\nsoon as they had passed this law, they wrote a letter to their agent,\r\nin which they acknowledge they had not conformed to the acts of\r\ntrade; and they say, they \"apprehended them to be an invasion of the\r\nrights, liberties and properties of the subjects of his majesty in\r\nthe colony, they not being represented in parliament, and according\r\nto the usual sayings of the learned in the law, _the laws of England\r\nwere bounded within the four seas, and did not reach America_.\r\nHowever, as his majesty had signified his pleasure, that these acts\r\nshould be observed in the Massachusetts, they had made provision by\r\na law of the colony, that they should be strictly attended to, from\r\ntime to time, although it greatly discouraged trade, and was a great\r\ndamage to his majesty's plantation.\"\r\n\r\nThus it appears, that the ancient Massachusettensians and Virginians,\r\nhad precisely the same sense of the authority of parliament viz. that\r\nit had none at all: and the same sense of the necessity, that by the\r\nvoluntary act of the colonies, their free cheerful consent, it should\r\nbe allowed the power of regulating trade: and this is precisely the\r\nidea of the late congress at Philadelphia, expressed in the fourth\r\nproposition in their Bill of Rights.\r\n\r\nBut this was the sense of the parent country too, at that time; for\r\nking Charles II. in a letter to the Massachusetts, after this law,\r\nhad been laid before him, has these words; \"We are informed that you\r\nhave lately made _some good provision_ for observing the acts of\r\ntrade and navigation, which is well pleasing unto us.\" Had he, or his\r\nministers an idea that parliament was the sovereign legislative over\r\nthe colony? If he had, would he not have censured this law, as an\r\ninsult to that legislature?\r\n\r\nI sincerely hope, we shall see no more such round affirmations, that\r\nit was the sense of the parent country and our ancestors, that they\r\nwere to remain subject to parliament.\r\n\r\nSo far from thinking themselves subject to parliament, that during\r\nthe Interregnum, it was their desire and design to have been a free\r\ncommonwealth, an independent republic; and after the restoration, it\r\nwas with the utmost reluctance, that in the course of 16 or 17 years,\r\nthey were brought to take the oaths of allegiance: and for some time\r\nafter this, they insisted upon taking an oath of fidelity to the\r\ncountry, before that of allegiance to the king.\r\n\r\nThat \"it is evident from the charter itself,\" that they were to\r\nremain subject to parliament, is very unaccountable, when there is\r\nnot one word in either charter concerning parliament.\r\n\r\nThat the authority of parliament has been exercised almost ever\r\nsince the settlement of the country, is a mistake; for there is no\r\ninstance, until the first Navigation Act, which was in 1660, more\r\nthan 40 years after the first settlement. This act was never executed\r\nor regarded, until 17 years afterwards, and then it was not executed\r\nas an act of parliament, but as a law of the colony, to which the\r\nking agreed.\r\n\r\n\"This has been expressly acknowledged by our provincial\r\nlegislatures.\" There is too much truth in this. It has been twice\r\nacknowledged by our house of Representatives, that parliament was the\r\nsupreme legislative; but this was directly repugnant to a multitude\r\nof other votes by which it was denied. This was in conformity to the\r\ndistinction between taxation and legislation, which has since been\r\nfound to be a distinction without a difference.\r\n\r\nWhen a great question is first started, there are very few, even of\r\nthe greatest minds, which suddenly and intuitively comprehend it, in\r\nall its consequences.\r\n\r\nIt is both \"our interest and our duty to continue subject to the\r\nauthority of parliament,\" as far as the regulation of our trade, if\r\nit will be content with that, but no longer.\r\n\r\n\"If the colonies are not subject to the authority of parliament,\r\nGreat Britain and the colonies must be distinct states, as completely\r\nso as England and Scotland were before the union, or as Great Britain\r\nand Hanover are now.\" There is no need of being startled at this\r\nconsequence. It is very harmless. There is no absurdity at all in it.\r\nDistinct states may be united under one king. And those states may\r\nbe further cemented and united together, by a treaty of commerce.\r\nThis is the case. We have, by our own express consent, contracted\r\nto observe the navigation act, and by our implied consent, by long\r\nusage and uninterrupted acquiescence, have submitted to the other\r\nacts of trade, however grievous some of them may be. This may be\r\ncompared to a treaty of commerce, by which those distinct states are\r\ncemented together, in perpetual league and amity. And if any further\r\nratifications of this pact or treaty are necessary, the colonies\r\nwould readily enter into them, provided their other liberties were\r\ninviolate.\r\n\r\nThat the colonies owe \"no allegiance\" to any imperial crown, provided\r\nsuch a crown involves in it an house of lords and a house of commons,\r\nis certain. Indeed, we owe no allegiance to any crown at all. We\r\nowe allegiance to the person of his majesty, king George the third,\r\nwhom God preserve. But allegiance is due universally, both from\r\nBritons and Americans to the person of the king, not to his crown:\r\nto his natural, not his politic capacity: as I will undertake to\r\nprove hereafter, from the highest authorities, and most solemn\r\nadjudications, which were ever made within any part of the British\r\ndominions.\r\n\r\nIf his majesty's title to the crown is \"derived from an act of\r\nparliament, made since the settlement of these colonies,\" it was\r\nnot made since the date of our charter. Our charter was granted by\r\nking William and queen Mary, three years after the revolution; and\r\nthe oaths of allegiance are established by a law of the province. So\r\nthat our allegiance to his majesty is not due by virtue of any act of\r\na British parliament, but by our own charter and province laws. It\r\nought to be remembered, that there was a revolution here, as well as\r\nin England, and that we made an original, express contract with king\r\nWilliam, as well as the people of England.\r\n\r\nIf it follows from thence, that he appears king of the Massachusetts,\r\nking of Rhode-Island, king of Connecticut, &c. this is no absurdity\r\nat all. He will appear in this light, and does appear so, whether\r\nparliament has authority over us or not. He is king of Ireland, I\r\nsuppose, although parliament is allowed to have authority there. As\r\nto giving his majesty those titles, I have no objection at all: I\r\nwish he would be graciously pleased to assume them.\r\n\r\nThe only proposition in all this writer's long string of pretended\r\nabsurdities, which he says follows from the position, that we are\r\ndistinct states, is this: That, \"as the king must govern each state\r\nby its parliament, those several parliaments would pursue the\r\nparticular interest of its own state; and however well disposed the\r\nking might be to pursue a line of interest that was common to all,\r\nthe checks and controul that he would meet with, would render it\r\nimpossible.\" Every argument ought to be allowed its full weight:\r\nand therefore candour obliges me to acknowledge, that here lies\r\nall the difficulty that there is in this whole controversy. There\r\nhas been, from first to last, on both sides of the Atlantic, an\r\nidea, an apprehension that it was necessary, there should be some\r\nsuperintending power, to draw together all the wills, and unite all\r\nthe strength of the subjects in all the dominions, in case of war,\r\nand in the case of trade. The necessity of this, in case of trade,\r\nhas been so apparent, that, as has often been said, we have consented\r\nthat parliament should exercise such a power. In case of war, it has\r\nby some been thought necessary. But, in fact and experience, it has\r\nnot been found so. What though the proprietary colonies, on account\r\nof disputes with the proprietors, did not come in so early to the\r\nassistance of the general cause in the last war, as they ought, and\r\nperhaps one of them not at all! The inconveniences of this were\r\nsmall, in comparison of the absolute ruin to the liberties of all\r\nwhich must follow the submission to parliament, in all cases, which\r\nwould be giving up all the popular limitations upon the government.\r\nThese inconveniences fell chiefly upon New England. She was\r\nnecessitated to greater exertions: but she had rather suffer these\r\nagain and again, than others infinitely greater. However this subject\r\nhas been so long in contemplation, that it is fully understood now,\r\nin all the colonies; so that there is no danger in case of another\r\nwar, of any colony's failing of its duty.\r\n\r\nBut admitting the proposition in its full force, that it is\r\nabsolutely necessary there should be a supreme power, co-extensive\r\nwith all the dominions, will it follow that parliament, as now\r\nconstituted, has a right to assume this supreme jurisdiction? By no\r\nmeans.\r\n\r\nA union of the colonies might be projected, and an American\r\nlegislature; for, if America has 3,000,000 people, and the whole\r\ndominions 12,000,000, she ought to send a quarter part of all the\r\nmembers to the house of commons, and instead of holding parliaments\r\nalways at Westminster, the haughty members for Great Britain must\r\nhumble themselves, one session in four, to cross the atlantic, and\r\nhold the parliament in America.\r\n\r\nThere is no avoiding all inconveniences in human affairs. The\r\ngreatest possible or conceivable would arise from ceding to\r\nparliament power over us, without a representation in it. The next\r\ngreatest would accrue from any plan that can be devised for a\r\nrepresentation there. The least of all would arise from going on\r\nas we begun, and fared well for 150 years, by letting parliament\r\nregulate trade, and our own assemblies all other matters.\r\n\r\nAs to \"the prerogatives not being defined, or limited,\" it is as much\r\nso in the colonies as in Great Britain, and as well understood, and\r\nas cheerfully submitted to in the former as the latter.\r\n\r\nBut \"where is the British constitution, that we all agree we are\r\nentitled to?\" I answer, if we enjoy, and are entitled to more liberty\r\nthan the British constitution allows, where is the harm? Or, if we\r\nenjoy the British constitution in greater purity and perfection than\r\nthey do in England, as is really the case, whose fault is this? Not\r\nours.\r\n\r\nWe may find all the blessings \"of this constitution in our provincial\r\nassemblies.\" Our houses of Representatives have, and ought to\r\nexercise, every power of the House of Commons. The first charter to\r\nthis colony is nothing to the present argument: but it did grant a\r\npower of taxing the people, implicitly, though not in express terms.\r\nIt granted all the rights and liberties of Englishmen, which include\r\nthe power of taxing the people.\r\n\r\n\"Our council boards,\" in the royal governments, \"are destitute of\r\nthe noble independence and splendid appendages of peerages.\" Most\r\ncertainty: they are the meanest creatures and tools in the political\r\ncreation; dependent every moment for their existence on the tainted\r\nbreath of a prime minister. But they have the authority of the house\r\nof lords, in our little models of the English constitution; and it is\r\nthis which makes them so great a grievance. The crown has really two\r\nbranches of our legislature in its power. Let an act of parliament\r\npass at home, putting it in the power of the king, to remove any peer\r\nfrom the house of lords at his pleasure, and what will become of the\r\nBritish constitution? It will be overturned from the foundation. Yet\r\nwe are perpetually insulted, by being told, that making our council\r\nby mandamus, brings us nearer to the British constitution. In this\r\nprovince, by charter, the council certainly hold their seats for\r\nthe year, after being chosen and approved, independent of both the\r\nother branches. For their creation, they are equally obliged to both\r\nthe other branches; so that there is little or no bias in favour of\r\neither, if any, it is in favour of the prerogative. In short, it is\r\nnot easy without an hereditary nobility, to constitute a council\r\nmore independent, more nearly resembling the house of lords, than\r\nthe council of this province has ever been by charter. But perhaps\r\nit will be said that we are to enjoy the British constitution in\r\nour supreme legislature, the parliament, not in our provincial\r\nlegislatures.\r\n\r\nTo this I answer, if parliament is to be our supreme legislature,\r\nwe shall be under a complete oligarchy or aristocracy, not the\r\nBritish constitution, which this writer himself defines a mixture\r\nof monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy.--For king, lords and\r\ncommons will constitute one great oligarchy, as they will stand\r\nrelated to America, as much as the decemvirs did in Rome; with this\r\ndifference for the worse, that our rulers are to be three thousand\r\nmiles off. The definition of an oligarchy, is a government by a\r\nnumber of grandees, over whom the people have no controul. The\r\nstates of Holland were once chosen by the people frequently; then\r\nchosen for life. Now they are not chosen by the people at all. When\r\na member dies, his place is filled up, not by the people he is to\r\nrepresent, but by the states. Is not this depriving the Hollanders\r\nof a free constitution, and subjecting them to an aristocracy, or\r\noligarchy? Will not the government of America be like it? Will not\r\nrepresentatives be chosen for them by others, whom they never saw\r\nnor heard of? If our provincial constitutions are in any respect\r\nimperfect and want alteration, they have capacity enough to discern\r\nit, and power enough to effect it, without the interposition of\r\nparliament. There never was an American constitution attempted by\r\nparliament, before the Quebec bill and Massachusetts bill. These\r\nare such _samples_ of what they may, and probably will be, that few\r\nAmericans are in love with them. However, America will never allow\r\nthat parliament has any authority to alter their constitution at all.\r\nShe is wholly penetrated with a sense of the necessity of resisting\r\nit, at all hazards. And she would resist it, if the constitution of\r\nthe Massachusetts had been altered as much for _the better_, as it\r\nis for the worse. The question we insist on most is not whether the\r\nalteration is for the better or not, but whether parliament has any\r\nright to make any alteration at all. And it is the universal sense of\r\nAmerica, that it has none.\r\n\r\nWe are told that \"the provincial constitutions have no principle of\r\nstability within themselves.\" This is so great a mistake, that there\r\nis not more order, or stability in any government upon the globe,\r\nthan there ever has been in that of Connecticut. The same may be\r\nsaid of the Massachusetts and Pennsylvania; and indeed of the others\r\nvery nearly. \"That these constitutions in turbulent times would\r\nbecome wholly monarchial, or wholly republican;\" they must be such\r\ntimes as would have a similar effect upon the constitution at home.\r\nBut in order to avoid the danger of this, what is to be done? Not\r\ngive us an English constitution, it seems, but make sure of us at\r\nonce, by giving us constitutions wholly monarchical, annihilating\r\nour houses of representatives first, by taking from them the support\r\nof government, &c. and then making the councils and judges wholly\r\ndependant on the crown.\r\n\r\nThat a representation in parliament is impracticable we all agree:\r\nbut the consequence is, that we must have a representation in our\r\nsupreme legislatures here. This was the consequence that was drawn by\r\nkings, ministers, our ancestors, and the whole nation, more than a\r\ncentury ago, when the colonies were first settled, and continued to\r\nbe the general sense until the last peace; and it must be the general\r\nsense again soon, or Great Britain will lose her colonies.\r\n\r\nThis is apparently the meaning of that celebrated passage in Gov.\r\nHutchinson's letter, that rung through the continent, viz. \"There\r\nmust be an abridgment of what is called English liberties.\" But all\r\nthe art and subtlety of Massachusettensis will never vindicate or\r\nexcuse that expression. According to this writer, it should have\r\nbeen \"there is an abridgment of English liberties, and it cannot\r\nbe otherwise.\" But every candid reader must see that the letter\r\nwriter had more than that in his _view_ and in his _wishes_. In the\r\nsame letter, a little before, he says, \"what marks of resentment\r\nthe parliament will shew, whether they will be upon the province in\r\ngeneral, or particular persons, is extremely uncertain; but that they\r\nwill be placed somewhere is most certain, and I add, _because I think\r\nit ought to be so_.\" Is it possible to read this without thinking\r\nof the port bill, the charter bill, and the resolves for sending\r\npersons to England by the statute of Henry VIII. to be tried! But\r\nthis is not all. \"This is most certainly a crisis,\" says he, &c. \"If\r\nno measure shall have been taken to secure this dependence, (i.e.\r\nthe dependence which a colony ought to have upon the parent state)\r\nit is all over with us.\" \"The friends of government will be utterly\r\ndisheartened; and the friends of anarchy will be afraid of nothing,\r\nbe it ever so extravagant.\" But this is not all. \"I never think of\r\nthe measures necessary for the peace and good order of the colonies\r\nwithout pain.\" \"There must be an abridgment of what are called\r\nEnglish liberties.\" What could he mean? Any thing less than depriving\r\nus of trial by jury? Perhaps he wanted an act of parliament to try\r\npersons here for treason by a court of admiralty. Perhaps an act that\r\nthe province should be governed by a governor and a mandamus council,\r\nwithout an house of representatives. But to put it out of all doubt\r\nthat his meaning was much worse than Massachusettensis endeavors to\r\nmake it, he explains himself in a subsequent part of the letter. \"I\r\nwish,\" says he, \"the good of the colony, _when I wish to see some\r\nfurther restraint of liberty_.\" Here it is rendered certain, that he\r\nis pleading for a further restraint of liberty, not explaining the\r\nrestraint, he apprehended the constitution had already laid us under.\r\n\r\nMy indignation at this letter, has sometimes been softened by\r\ncompassion. It carries on the face of it evident marks of _madness_.\r\nIt was written in such a transport of passions, _ambition_ and\r\n_revenge_ chiefly, that his reason was manifestly overpowered. The\r\nvessel was tost in such a hurricane, that she could not feel her\r\nhelm. Indeed, he seems to have had a confused consciousness of this\r\nhimself. Pardon me this excursion, says he, it really proceeds from\r\nthe state of mind into which our perplexed affairs often throws me.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is our highest interest to continue a part of the British\r\nempire; and equally our duty to remain subject to the authority of\r\nparliament,\" says Massachusettensis.\r\n\r\nWe are a part of the British dominions, that is of the king of Great\r\nBritain, and it is our interest and duty to continue so. It is\r\nequally our interest and duty to continue subject to the authority\r\nof parliament, in the regulation of our trade, as long as she shall\r\nleave us to govern our internal policy, and to give and grant our own\r\nmoney, and no longer.\r\n\r\nThis letter concludes with an agreeable flight of fancy. The time\r\nmay not be so far off, however, as this writer imagines, when the\r\ncolonies may have the balance of numbers and wealth in her favour.\r\nBut when that shall happen, if we should attempt to rule her by an\r\nAmerican parliament, without an adequate representation in it, she\r\nwill infallibly resist us by her arms.\r\n\r\nNOVANGLUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESSED\r\n\r\n_To the Inhabitants of the Colony of Massachusetts Bay_,\r\n\r\nMarch 13, 1775.\r\n\r\n\r\nMY FRIENDS,\r\n\r\nIt has been often observed by me, and it cannot be too often\r\nrepeated, that _colonization_ is _casus omissus_ at common law. There\r\nis no such title known in that law. By common law, I mean that system\r\nof customs, written and unwritten, which was known and in force in\r\nEngland, in the time of king Richard 1st. This continued to be the\r\ncase, down to the reign of Elizabeth, and king James 1st. In all that\r\ntime, the laws of England were confined to the realm, and within the\r\nfour seas. There was no provision made in this law for governing\r\ncolonies beyond the Atlantic, or beyond the four seas, by authority\r\nof parliament, no nor for the king to grant charters to subjects\r\nto settle in foreign countries. It was the king's prerogative to\r\nprohibit the emigration of any of his subjects, by issuing his writ\r\n_ne exeat regno_. And therefore it was in the king's power to permit\r\nhis subjects to leave the kingdom. 1 Hawk. P.C. c. 22. § 4. \"It is a\r\nhigh crime to disobey the king's lawful commands, or prohibitions,\r\nas not returning from beyond sea, upon the king's letters to that\r\npurpose; for which the offender's lands shall be seized until he\r\nreturn; and when he does return, he shall be fined, &c. or going\r\nbeyond sea, against the king's will, expressly signified, either\r\nby the writ _ne exeat regno_, or under the great or privy seal, or\r\nsignet, or by proclamation.\" When a subject left the kingdom, by the\r\nking's permission, and if the nation did not remonstrate against\r\nit, by the nation's permission too, at least connivance, he carried\r\nwith him, as a man, all the rights of nature. His allegiance bound\r\nhim to the king, and entitled him to protection. But how? not in\r\nFrance; the king of England was not bound to protect him in France,\r\nnor in America; not in the dominions of Lewis, nor of Passachus, or\r\nMassachusetts. He had a right to protection, and the liberties of\r\nEngland upon his return there, not otherwise. How then do we, New\r\nEnglandmen, derive our laws? I say, not from parliament, not from\r\ncommon law, but from the law of nature, and the compact made with the\r\nking in our charters. Our ancestors were entitled to the common law\r\nof England, when they emigrated, that is, to just so much of it as\r\nthey pleased to adopt, and no more. They were not bound or obliged to\r\nsubmit to it, unless they chose it. By a positive principle of the\r\ncommon law, they were bound, let them be in what part of the world\r\nthey would, to do nothing against the allegiance of the king. But\r\nno kind of provision was ever made by common law, for punishing or\r\ntrying any man, even for treason, committed out of the realm. He must\r\nbe tried in some county of the realm, by that law, the county where\r\nthe overt-act was done, or he could not be tried at all. Nor was\r\nany provision ever made, until the reign of Henry VIII. for trying\r\ntreasons committed abroad, and the acts of that reign were made on\r\npurpose to catch cardinal Pole.\r\n\r\nSo that our ancestors, when they emigrated, having obtained\r\npermission of the king to come here, and being never commanded to\r\nreturn into the realm, had a clear right to have erected in this\r\nwilderness a British constitution, or a perfect democracy, or any\r\nother form of government they saw fit. They indeed, while they lived,\r\ncould not have taken arms against the king of England, without\r\nviolating their allegiance, but their children would not have been\r\nborn within the king's allegiance, would not have been natural\r\nsubjects, and consequently not entitled to protection, or bound to\r\nthe king.\r\n\r\nMassachusettensis, Jan. 16, seems possessed of these ideas, and\r\nattempts in the most aukward manner, to get rid of them. He is\r\nconscious that America must be a part of the realm, before it can\r\nbe bound by the authority of parliament; and therefore is obliged\r\nto suggest, that we are annexed to the realm, and to endeavour to\r\nconfuse himself and his readers, by confounding the realm, with the\r\nempire and dominions.\r\n\r\nBut will any man soberly contend, that America was ever annexed to\r\nthe realm? to what realm? When New England was settled, there was a\r\nrealm of England, a realm of Scotland, and a realm of Ireland. To\r\nwhich of these three realms was New England annexed? To the realm\r\nof England, it will be said. But by what law? no territory could be\r\nannexed to the realm of England, but by an act of parliament. Acts\r\nof parliament have been passed to annex Wales, &c. &c. to the realm.\r\nBut none ever passed to annex America. But if New-England was annexed\r\nto the realm of England, how came she annexed to the realm of, or\r\nkingdom of Great Britain? The two realms of England and Scotland\r\nwere, by the act of union, incorporated into one kingdom by the name\r\nof Great Britain: but there is not one word about America in that act.\r\n\r\nBesides, if America was annexed to the realm, or a part of the\r\nkingdom, every act of parliament that is made, would extend to\r\nit, named or not named. But every body knows that every act of\r\nparliament, and every other record, constantly distinguishes between\r\nthis kingdom, and his majesty's other dominions. Will it be said\r\nthat Ireland is annexed to the realm, or a part of the kingdom of\r\nGreat Britain? Ireland is a distinct kingdom, or realm, by itself,\r\nnotwithstanding British parliament claims a right of binding it in\r\nall cases, and exercises it in some. And even so the Massachusetts\r\nis a realm, New York is a realm, Pennsylvania another realm, to all\r\nintents and purposes, as much as Ireland is, or England or Scotland\r\never were. The king of Great Britain is the sovereign of all these\r\nrealms.\r\n\r\nThis writer says, \"that in denying that the Colonies are annexed to\r\nthe realm, and subject to the authority of parliament, individuals\r\nand bodies of men subvert the fundamentals of government, deprive us\r\nof British liberties, and build up absolute monarchy in the colonies.\"\r\n\r\nThis is the first time that I ever heard or read that the colonies\r\nare annexed to the realm. It is utterly denied that they are, and\r\nthat it is possible they should be, without an act of parliament, and\r\nacts of the colonies. Such an act of parliament cannot be produced,\r\nnor any such law of any one colony. Therefore as this writer builds\r\nthe whole authority of parliament upon this fact, viz: That the\r\ncolonies are annexed to the realm, and as it is certain they never\r\nwere so annexed, the consequence is, that his whole superstructure\r\nfalls.\r\n\r\nWhen he says, that they subvert the fundamentals of government,\r\nhe begs the question. We say that the contrary doctrines subvert\r\nthe fundamentals of government. When he says that they deprive us\r\nof British liberties, he begs the question again. We say that the\r\ncontrary doctrine deprives us of English liberties; as to British\r\nliberties, we scarcely know what they are, as the liberties of\r\nEngland and Scotland are not precisely the same to this day. English\r\nliberties are but certain rights of nature, reserved to the citizen,\r\nby the English constitution, which rights cleaved to our ancestors,\r\nwhen they crossed the Atlantic, and would have inhered in them, if\r\ninstead of coming to New-England they had gone to Outaheite, or\r\nPatagonia, even although they had taken no patent or charter from\r\nthe king at all. These rights did not adhere to them the less, for\r\ntheir purchasing patents and charters, in which the king expressly\r\nstipulates with them, that they and their posterity should forever\r\nenjoy all those rights and liberties.\r\n\r\nThe human mind is not naturally the clearest atmosphere; but the\r\nclouds and vapours which have been raised in it, by the artifices\r\nof temporal and spiritual tyrants, have made it impossible to see\r\nobjects in it distinctly. Scarcely any thing is involved in more\r\nsystematical obscurity, than the rights of our ancestors, when they\r\narrived in America. How, in common sense, came the dominions of king\r\nPhilip, king Massachusetts, and twenty other sovereigns, independent\r\nprinces here, to be within the allegiance of the kings of England,\r\nJames and Charles? America was no more within the allegiance of those\r\nprinces, by the common law of England, or by the law of nature, than\r\nFrance and Spain were. Discovery, if that was incontestible, could\r\ngive no title to the English king, by common law, or by the law of\r\nnature, to the lands, tenements, and hereditaments of the native\r\nIndians here. Our ancestors were sensible of this, and therefore\r\nhonestly purchased their lands of the natives. They might have bought\r\nthem to hold allodially, if they would.\r\n\r\nBut there were two ideas, which confused them, and have continued\r\nto confuse their posterity, one derived from the feudal, the other\r\nfrom the canon law. By the former of these systems, the prince,\r\nthe general, was supposed to be sovereign lord of all the lands,\r\nconquered by the soldiers in his army; and upon this principle, the\r\nking of England was considered in law as sovereign lord of all the\r\nland within the realm. If he had sent an army here to conquer king\r\nMassachusetts, and it had succeeded, he would have been sovereign\r\nlord of the land here upon these principles; but there was no rule of\r\nthe common law, that made the discovery of a country by a subject,\r\na title to that country in the prince. But conquest would not have\r\nannexed the country to the realm, nor have given any authority to\r\nthe parliament. But there was another mist cast before the eyes of\r\nthe English nation from another source. The pope claimed a sovereign\r\npropriety in, as well as authority over the whole earth. As head of\r\nthe christian church, and vicar of God, he claimed this authority\r\nover all Christendom; and, in the same character, he claimed a right\r\nto all the countries and possessions of heathens and infidels; a\r\nright divine to exterminate and destroy them at his discretion, in\r\norder to propagate the catholic faith. When king Henry VIII. and\r\nhis parliament, threw off the authority of the pope, stripped his\r\nholiness of his supremacy, and invested it in himself by an act of\r\nparliament, he and his courtiers seemed to think that all the rights\r\nof the holy see were transferred to him; and it was a union of these\r\ntwo, the most impertinent and fantastical ideas that ever got into an\r\nhuman pericranium, viz: that as feudal sovereign and supreme head of\r\nthe church together, a king of England had a right to all the land\r\ntheir subjects could find, not possessed by any christian state,\r\nor prince, though possessed by heathen or infidel nations, which\r\nseems to have deluded the nation about the time of the settlement\r\nof the colonies. But none of these ideas gave or inferred any right\r\nin parliament, over the new countries conquered or discovered; and\r\ntherefore denying that the colonies are a part of the realm, and\r\nthat as such they are subject to parliament, by no means deprives\r\nus of English liberties. Nor does it \"build up absolute monarchy in\r\nthe colonies.\" For admitting these notions of the common and feudal\r\nlaw to have been in full force, and that the king was absolute in\r\nAmerica, when it was settled; yet he had a right to enter into a\r\ncontract with his subjects, and stipulate that they should enjoy all\r\nthe rights and liberties of Englishmen forever, in consideration of\r\ntheir undertaking to clear the wilderness, propagate christianity,\r\npay a fifth part of ore, &c. Such a contract as this has been\r\nmade with all the colonies; royal governments, as well as charter\r\nones. For the commissions to the governors contain the plan of the\r\ngovernment, and the contract between the king and subject, in the\r\nformer, as much as the charters in the latter.\r\n\r\nIndeed this was the reasoning, and upon these feudal and\r\n_catholic_ principles in the time of some of the predecessors of\r\nMassachusettensis. This was the meaning of Dudley, when he asked, \"Do\r\nyou think that English liberties will follow you to the ends of the\r\nearth?\" His meaning was, that English liberties were confined to the\r\nrealm, and out of that the king was absolute. But this was not true;\r\nfor an English king had no right to be absolute over Englishmen, out\r\nof the realm, any more than in it, and they were released from their\r\nallegiance, as soon as he deprived them of their liberties.\r\n\r\nBut \"our charters suppose regal authority in the grantor.\" True\r\nthey suppose it, whether there was any or not. \"If that authority\r\nbe derived from the British (he should have said English) crown,\r\nit presupposes this territory to have been a part of the British\r\n(he should have said English) dominion, and as such subject to the\r\nimperial sovereign.\" How can this writer shew this authority to be\r\nderived from the English crown, including in the idea of it lords\r\nand commons? Is there the least color for such an authority but in\r\nthe popish and feudal ideas before mentioned? And do these popish\r\nand feudal ideas include parliament? Was parliament, were lords and\r\ncommons parts of the head of the church, or was parliament, that\r\nis, lords and commons, part of the sovereign feudatory? Never. But\r\nwhy was this authority derived from the English, any more than the\r\nScottish or Irish crown? It is true the land was to be held in\r\nsoccage, like the manor of East Greenwich; but this was compact, and\r\nit might have been as well to hold, as they held in Glasgow or Dublin.\r\n\r\nBut, says this writer, \"if that authority was vested in the person\r\nof the king in a different capacity, the British constitution and\r\nlaws are out of the question, and the king must be absolute as to us,\r\nas his prerogatives have never been limited.\" Not the prerogatives\r\nlimited in our charters, when in every one of them all the rights\r\nof Englishmen are secured to us! Are not the rights of Englishmen\r\nsufficiently known, and are not the prerogatives of the king among\r\nthose rights?\r\n\r\nAs to those colonies which are destitute of charters, the commissions\r\nto their governors have ever been considered as equivalent\r\nsecurities, both for property, jurisdiction, and privileges, with\r\ncharters; and as to the power of the crown being absolute in those\r\ncolonies, it is absolute no where. There is no fundamental or other\r\nlaw, that makes a king of England absolute any where, except in\r\nconquered countries; and an attempt to assume such a power, by the\r\nfundamental laws, forfeits the prince's right even to the limited\r\ncrown.\r\n\r\nAs to \"the charter governments reverting to absolute monarchy, as\r\ntheir charters may happen to be forfeited, by the grantees not\r\nfulfilling the conditions of them;\" I answer, if they could be\r\nforfeited, and were actually forfeited, the only consequence would\r\nbe, that the king would have no power over them at all. He would\r\nnot be bound to protect the people, nor, that I can see, would the\r\npeople here, who were born here, be, by any principle of common law,\r\nbound even to allegiance to the king. The connection would be broken\r\nbetween the crown and the natives of the country.\r\n\r\nIt has been a great dispute whether charters granted within the\r\nrealm, can be forfeited at all. It was a question debated with\r\ninfinite learning, in the case of the charter of London: it was\r\nadjudged forfeited, in an arbitrary reign: but afterwards, after\r\nthe revolution, it was declared in parliament, not forfeited, and\r\nby an act of parliament made incapable of forfeiture. The charter\r\nof Massachusetts was declared forfeited too. So were other American\r\ncharters. The Massachusetts alone, were tame enough to give it up.\r\nBut no American charter will ever be decreed forfeited again, or if\r\nany should, the decree will be regarded no more, than a vote of the\r\nlower house of the robinhood society. The court of chancery has no\r\nauthority without the realm; by common law, surely it has none in\r\nAmerica. What! the privileges of millions of Americans depend on the\r\ndiscretion of a lord chancellor? God forbid! The passivity of this\r\ncolony in receiving the present charter, in lieu of the first, is,\r\nin the opinion of some, the deepest stain upon its character. There\r\nis less to be said in excuse for it, than the witchcraft, or hanging\r\nthe Quakers. A vast party in the province were against it at the\r\ntime, and thought themselves betrayed by their agent. It has been a\r\nwarning to their posterity, and one principal motive with the people,\r\nnever to trust any agent with power to concede away their privileges\r\nagain. It may as well be pretended that the people of Great Britain\r\ncan forfeit their privileges, as the people of this province. If the\r\ncontract of state is broken, the people and king of England must\r\nrecur to nature. It is the same in this province. We shall never more\r\nsubmit to decrees in chancery, or acts of parliament, annihilating\r\ncharters, or abridging English liberties.\r\n\r\nWhether Massachusettensis was born as a politician, in the year\r\n1764, I knew [Errata: know] not: but he often writes as if he know\r\n[Errata: knew] nothing of that period. In his attempt to trace the\r\ndenial of the supreme authority of the parliament, he commits such\r\nmistakes, as a man of age, at that time, ought to blush at. He says,\r\nthat \"when the stamp act was made, the authority of parliament to\r\nimpose external taxes, or, in other words, to lay duties upon goods\r\nand merchandize was admitted,\" and that when the tea act was made, \"a\r\nnew distinction was set up, that parliament had a right to lay duties\r\nupon merchandize, for the purpose of regulating trade, but not for\r\nthe purpose of raising a revenue.\" This is a total misapprehension\r\nof the declared opinions of people at those times. The authority\r\nof parliament to lay taxes for a revenue has been always generally\r\ndenied. And their right to lay duties to regulate trade, has been\r\ndenied by many, who have ever contended that trade should be\r\nregulated only by prohibitions.\r\n\r\nThe act of parliament of the 4th George 3d, passed in the year\r\n1764, was the first act of the British parliament that ever was\r\npassed, in which the design of raising a revenue was expressed. Let\r\nMassachusettensis name any statute before that, in which the word\r\nrevenue is used, or the thought of raising a revenue is expressed.\r\nThis act is entitled, \"an act for granting certain duties in the\r\nBritish colonies, and plantations in America,\" &c. The word revenue,\r\nin the preamble of this act, instantly ran through the colonies, and\r\nrang an alarm, almost as much as if the design of forging chains\r\nfor the colonists had been expressed in words. I have now before me\r\na pamphlet, written and printed in the year 1764, entitled, \"The\r\nsentiments of a British American,\" upon this act. How the idea of a\r\nrevenue, though from an acknowledged external tax, was relished in\r\nthat time, may be read in the frontispiece of that pamphlet.\r\n\r\n              _Ergo quid refert mea\r\n     Cui serviam? clitellas dum portem meas._ PHAEDRUS.\r\n\r\nThe first objection to this act, which was made in that pamphlet,\r\nby its worthy author, OXENBRIDGE THACHER, Esq. who died a\r\nmartyr to that amity [Errata: anxiety] for his country, which the\r\nconduct of the junto gave him, is this, \"The first objection is,\r\nthat a tax is thereby laid on several commodities, to be raised\r\nand levied in the plantations, and to be remitted home to England.\r\nThis is esteemed a grievance, inasmuch as the same are laid, without\r\nthe consent of the representatives of the colonists. It is esteemed\r\nan essential British right, that no person shall be subject to any\r\ntax; but what in person, or by his representative, he hath a voice\r\nin laying.\" Here is a tax unquestionably external, in the sense in\r\nwhich that word is used, in the distinction that is made by some\r\nbetween external and internal taxes, and unquestionably laid in part\r\nfor the regulation of trade; yet called a grievance, and a violation\r\nof an essential British right, in the year 1764, by one who was then\r\nat the head of the popular branch of our constitution, and as well\r\nacquainted with the sense of his constituents, as any man living. And\r\nit is indisputable, that in those words he wrote the almost universal\r\nsense of this colony.\r\n\r\nThere are so many egregious errors in point of fact, and respecting\r\nthe opinions of the people in this writer, which it is difficult to\r\nimpute to wilful misrepresentation, that I sometimes think he is some\r\nsmart young gentleman, come up into life since this great controversy\r\nwas opened; if not, he must have conversed wholly with the junto, and\r\nthey must have deceived him, respecting their own sentiments.\r\n\r\nThis writer sneers at the distinction between a right to lay the\r\nformer duty of a shilling on the pound of tea, and the right to\r\nlay the three pence. But is there not a real difference between\r\nlaying a duty to be paid in England upon exportation, and to be\r\npaid in America upon importation? Is there not a difference between\r\nparliament's laying on duties within their own realm, where they have\r\nundoubtedly jurisdiction, and laying them out of their realm, nay\r\nlaying them on in our realm, where we say they have no jurisdiction?\r\nLet them lay on what duties they please in England, we have nothing\r\nto say against that.\r\n\r\n\"Our patriots most heroically resolved to become independent states,\r\nand flatly denied that parliament had a right to make any laws\r\nwhatever that should be binding upon the colonies.\"\r\n\r\nOur scribbler, more heroically still, is determined to shew the\r\nworld, that he has courage superior to all regard to modesty,\r\njustice, or truth. Our patriots have never determined, or desired to\r\nbe independent states, if a voluntary cession of a right to regulate\r\ntheir trade can make them dependent even on parliament, though\r\nthey are clear in theory, that by the common law, and the English\r\nconstitution, parliament has no authority over them. None of the\r\npatriots of this province, of the present age, have ever denied that\r\nparliament has a right, from our voluntary cession, to make laws\r\nwhich shall bind the colonies, as far as their commerce extends.\r\n\r\n\"There is no possible medium between absolute independence and\r\nsubjection to the authority of parliament.\" If this is true, it may\r\nbe depended upon, that all North America are as fully convinced of\r\ntheir independence, their absolute independence, as they are of their\r\nown existence, and as fully determined to defend it at all hazards,\r\nas Great Britain is to defend her independence against foreign\r\nnations. But it is not true. An absolute independence of parliament,\r\nin all internal concerns and cases of taxation, is very compatible\r\nwith an absolute dependence on it, in all cases of external commerce.\r\n\r\n\"He must be blind indeed that cannot see our dearest interest in\r\nthe latter, (that is in an absolute subjection to the authority\r\nof parliament,) notwithstanding many pant after the former\" (that\r\nis absolute independence.) The man who is capable of writing, in\r\ncool blood, that our interest lies in an absolute subjection to\r\nparliament, is capable of writing, or saying any thing for the\r\nsake of his pension: a legislature that has so often discovered a\r\nwant of information concerning us and our country; a legislature\r\ninterested to lay burdens upon us; a legislature, two branches of\r\nwhich, I mean the lords and commons, neither love nor fear us! Every\r\nAmerican of fortune and common sense, must look upon his property to\r\nbe sunk downright one half of its value, the moment such an absolute\r\nsubjection to parliament is established.\r\n\r\nThat there are any who pant after \"independence,\" (meaning by this\r\nword a new plan of government over all America, unconnected with the\r\ncrown of England, or meaning by it an exemption from the power of\r\nparliament to regulate trade) is as great a slander upon the province\r\nas ever was committed to writing. The patriots of this province\r\ndesire nothing new; they wish only to keep their old privileges.\r\nThey were for 150 years allowed to tax themselves, and govern\r\ntheir internal concerns, as they thought best. Parliament governed\r\ntheir trade as they thought fit. This plan, they wish may continue\r\nforever. But it is honestly confessed, rather than become subject to\r\nthe absolute authority of parliament, in all cases of taxation and\r\ninternal polity, they will be driven to throw off that of regulating\r\ntrade.\r\n\r\n\"To deny the supreme authority of the state, is a high misdemeanor;\r\nto oppose it by force, an overt act of treason.\" True: and therefore\r\nMassachusettensis, who denies the king represented by his governor,\r\nhis majesty's council, by charter, and house of representatives, to\r\nbe the supreme authority of this province, has been guilty of a high\r\nmisdemeanour: and those ministers, governors, and their instruments,\r\nwho have brought a military force here, and employed it against that\r\nsupreme authority, are guilty of ----, and ought to be punished with\r\n----. I will be more mannerly than Massachusettensis.\r\n\r\n\"The realm of England is an appropriate term for the ancient realm of\r\nEngland, in contradistinction to Wales and other territories, that\r\nhave been annexed to it.\"\r\n\r\nThere are so many particulars in the case of Wales analogous to the\r\ncase of America, that I must beg leave to enlarge upon it.\r\n\r\nWales was a little portion of the island of Great Britain, which the\r\nSaxons were never able to conquer. The Britons had reserved this\r\ntract of land to themselves, and subsisted wholly by pasturage,\r\namong their mountains. Their princes, however, during the Norman\r\nperiod, and until the reign of king Edward the first, did homage to\r\nthe crown of England, as their feudal sovereign, in the same manner\r\nas the prince of one independent state in Europe frequently did to\r\nthe sovereign of another. This little principality of shepherds and\r\ncowherds, had however maintained their independence, through long\r\nand bloody wars against the omnipotence of England, for 800 years.\r\nIt is needless to enumerate the causes of the war between Lewellyn\r\nand Edward the first. It is sufficient to say that the Welch prince\r\nrefused to go to England to do homage, and Edward obtained a new aid\r\nof a fifteenth from his parliament, to march with a strong force\r\ninto Wales. Edward was joined by David and Roderic, two brothers of\r\nLewellyn, who made a strong party among the Welch themselves, to\r\nassist and second the attempts to enslave their native country. The\r\nEnglish monarch, however, with all these advantages, was afraid to\r\nput the valor of his enemies to a trial, and trusted to the _slow\r\neffects of famine_ to subdue them. Their pasturage, with such an\r\nenemy in their country, could not subsist them, and Lewellyn, Nov.\r\n19, 1277, at last submitted, and bound himself to pay a reparation\r\nof damages, to do homage to the crown of England, and almost to\r\nsurrender his independence as a prince, by permitting all the other\r\nBarons of Wales, excepting four, to swear fealty to the same crown.\r\nBut fresh complaints soon arose. The English grew insolent on their\r\nbloodless victory, and oppressed the inhabitants; many insults were\r\noffered, which at last raised the indignation of the Welch, so that\r\nthey determined again to take arms, rather than bear any longer the\r\noppression of the haughty victors. The war raged sometime, until\r\nEdward summoned all his military tenants, and advanced with an army\r\ntoo powerful for the Welch to resist. Lewellyn was at last surprized,\r\nby Edward's general Mortimer, and fighting at a great disadvantage,\r\nwas slain, with two thousand of his men. David, who succeeded in\r\nthe principality, maintained the war for some time, but at last was\r\nbetrayed to the enemy, sent in chains to Shrewsbury, brought to a\r\nformal trial before the peers of England, and although a sovereign\r\nprince, ordered by Edward to be hanged, drawn and quartered, as a\r\ntraitor, for defending by arms the liberties of his native country!\r\nAll the Welch nobility submitted to the conqueror. The laws of\r\nEngland, sheriffs, and other ministers of justice, were established\r\nin that principality, which had maintained its liberties and\r\nindependency, 800 years.\r\n\r\nNow Wales was always part of the dominions of England. \"Wales was\r\nalways feudatory to the kingdom of England.\" It was always held of\r\nthe crown of England, or the kingdom of England: that is, whoever\r\nwas king of England, had a right to homage, &c. from the prince\r\nof Wales. But yet Wales was not parcel of the realm or kingdom,\r\nnor bound by the laws of England. I mention, and insist upon this,\r\nbecause it shews, that although the colonies are bound to the crown\r\nof England, or, in other words, owe allegiance to whomsoever is king\r\nof England; yet it does not follow that the colonies are parcel of\r\nthe realm or kingdom, and bound by its laws. As this is a point of\r\ngreat importance, I must beg pardon, however unentertaining it may\r\nbe, to produce my authorities.\r\n\r\nComyns digest, v. 5. page 626. Wales was always feudatory to the\r\nkingdom of England.\r\n\r\nHeld of the crown, but not parcel. Per Cook. 1 Roll. 247. 2 Roll. 29.\r\nAnd therefore the kings of Wales did homage, and swore fealty to H.\r\n2. and John and H. 3.\r\n\r\nAnd 11 Ed. 1. Upon the conquest of Lewellyn, prince or king of\r\nWales, that principality became a part of the dominion of the realm\r\nof England. And by the statute Walliae 12 Ed. 1. It was annexed and\r\nunited to the crown of England, _tanquam partem corporis ejusdem,\r\n&c._ Yet if the statute Walliae, made at Rutland 12 Ed. 1. was not\r\nan act of parliament (as it seems that it was not) the incorporation\r\nmade thereby was only an union \"_jure feudali, et non jure\r\nproprietatis_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wales, before the union with England, was governed by its proper\r\nlaws,\" &c.\r\n\r\nBy these authorities it appears, that Wales was subject, by the\r\nfeudal law, to the crown of England, before the conquest of Lewellyn;\r\nbut not subject to the laws of England; and indeed after this\r\nconquest, Edward and his nobles, did not seem to think it subject to\r\nthe English parliament, but to the will of the king as a conqueror\r\nof it in war. Accordingly that instrument which is called _Statutum\r\nWalliae_, and to be found in the appendix to the statutes p. 3,\r\nalthough it was made by the advice of the peers, or officers of the\r\narmy more properly, yet it never was passed as an act of parliament,\r\nbut as an edict of the king. It begins not in the stile of an act\r\nof parliament. _Edwardus Dei gratia Rex Angliae, Dominus Hyberniae,\r\net Dux Aquitaniae, omnibus fidelibus suis, &c. in Wallia. Divina\r\nprovidentia, quae in sui dispositione_, says he, _non fallitur, inter\r\nalia dispensationis suae munera, quibus nos et Regnum nostrum Angliae\r\ndecorare dignata est, terram Walliae, cum, incolis suis, prius,\r\nnobis_, jure feudali _subjectam, jam sui gratia_, in proprietatis\r\nnostrae dominium, _obstaculis quibuscumque cessantibus, totaliter,\r\net cum integritate convertit_, et coronae regni praedicti, tanquam\r\npartem corporis ejusdem annexuit et univit.\r\n\r\nHere is the most certain evidence that Wales was subject to the kings\r\nof England by the feudal law before the conquest, though not bound by\r\nany laws but their own. 2d. That the conquest was considered, in that\r\nday, as conferring the property, as well as jurisdiction of Wales\r\nto the English crown. 3. The conquest was considered as annexing\r\nand uniting Wales to the English crown, both in point of property\r\nand jurisdiction, as a part of one body. Yet notwithstanding all\r\nthis, parliament was not considered as acquiring any share in the\r\ngovernment of Wales by this conquest. If, then, it should be admitted\r\nthat the colonies are all annexed and united to the crown of England,\r\nit will not follow that lords and commons have any authority over\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThis statutum Walliae, as well as the whole case and history of\r\nthat principality, is well worthy of the attention and study of\r\nAmericans, because it abounds with evidence, that a country may be\r\nsubject to the crown of England, without being subject to the lords\r\nand commons of that realm, which entirely overthrows the whole\r\nargument of Gov. Hutchinson, and of Massachusettensis, in support of\r\nthe supreme authority of parliament, over all the dominions of the\r\nimperial crown. \"_Nos itaque_, &c. says King Edward 1. \"_volentes\r\npredictam terram, &c. sicut et caeteras ditioni nostrae subjectas,\r\n&c. subdebito regimine gubernari, et incolas seu habitatores terrarum\r\nillaram, qui alto et basso_, se submiserunt voluntati nostrae,\r\n_et quos sic ad nostram recepimus voluntatem, certis legibus et\r\nconsuetudinibus, &c. tractari leges, et consuetudines, partum\r\nillarum hactenus usitatas coram nobis et proceribus regni nostri\r\nfecimus recitari, quibus diligenter auditis, et plenus intellectis,\r\nquasdam ipsarum de concilio procerum predictorum delevimus, quasdam\r\npermisimus, et quasdam correximus, et etiam quasdam alias adjungendas\r\net statuendas decrevimus, et eas, &c. observari volumus in forma\r\nsubscripta._\"\r\n\r\nAnd then goes on to prescribe and establish a whole code of laws for\r\nthe principality, in the style of a sole legislature, and concludes,\r\n\r\n_Et ideo vobis mandamus, quod premissa de cetero in omnibus firmiter\r\nobservatis. Ita tamen quod quotiescunque, et quandocunque, et\r\nubicunque, nobis placuerit, possimus predicta statuta et coram partes\r\nsingulas declarare, interpretari, addere sive diminuere, pro nostro\r\nlibito voluntatis, et prout securitati nostrae et terrae nostrae\r\npredictae viderimus expedire._\r\n\r\nHere is then a conquered people submitting to a system of laws\r\nframed by the mere will of the conqueror, and agreeing to be forever\r\ngoverned by his mere will. This absolute monarch, then, might\r\nafterwards govern this country, with or without the advice of his\r\nEnglish lords and commons.\r\n\r\nTo shew that Wales was held before the conquest of Lewellyn, of the\r\nking of England, although governed by its own laws, hear lord Coke,\r\nInst. 194, in his commentary on the statute of Westminster. \"At this\r\ntime, viz. in 3 Ed. 1. Lewellyn was a prince or king of Wales, who\r\nheld the _same of the king of England, as his superior lord, and owed\r\nhim liege homage and fealty_; and this is proved by our act, viz:\r\nthat the king of England was _superior dominus_, i. e. sovereign lord\r\nof the kingdom, or principality of Wales.\"\r\n\r\nLord Coke, in 4 Inst. 239, says \"Wales was sometime a realm, or\r\nkingdom, (realm from the French word royaume, and both a regno) and\r\ngoverned _per suas regulas_,\" and afterwards, \"but _jure feudali_,\r\nthe kingdom of Wales was holden of the _crown of England_, and\r\nthereby, as Bracton saith, was _sub potestate regis_. And so it\r\ncontinued until the 11th year of king Edward 1st. when he subdued the\r\nprince of Wales, rising against him, and executed him for treason.\"\r\n\"The next year, viz. in the 12th year of king Edward 1. by authority\r\nof parliament, it is declared thus, speaking in the person of the\r\nking, as ancient statutes were wont to do, _divina providentia_,\"\r\n&c. as in the statute _Walliae_, before recited. But here is an\r\ninaccuracy, for the _statutum Walliae_ was not an act of parliament,\r\nbut made by the king with the advice of his officers of the army, by\r\nhis sole authority, as the statute itself sufficiently shews. \"Note,\"\r\nsays lord Coke, \"diverse monarchs hold their kingdoms of others _jure\r\nfeudali_, as the duke of Lombardy, Cicill, Naples, and Bohemia of the\r\nempire, Granado, Leons of Aragon, Navarre, Portugal of Castile; and\r\nso others.\"\r\n\r\nAfter this the Welch seem to have been fond of the English laws, and\r\ndesirous of being incorporated into the realm, to be represented in\r\nparliament, and enjoy all the rights of Englishmen, as well as to\r\nbe bound by the English laws. But kings were so fond of governing\r\nthis principality by their discretion alone, that they never could\r\nobtain these blessings until the reign of Henry 8th. and then they\r\nonly could obtain a statute, which enabled the king to alter their\r\nlaws at his pleasure. They did indeed obtain in the 15 Ed. 2. a writ\r\nto call twenty-four members to the parliament at York from South\r\nWales, and twenty-four from North Wales; and again in the 20 Ed. 2.\r\nthe like number of forty-eight members for Wales, at the parliament\r\nof Westminster. But lord Coke tells us \"that this wise and warlike\r\nnation was long after the _statutum Walliae_ not satisfied nor\r\ncontented, and especially, for that they truly and constantly took\r\npart with their rightful sovereign and liege lord, king Richard 2d.;\r\nin revenge whereof they had many severe and invective laws made\r\nagainst them in the reigns of Henry 4th. Henry 5th. &c. all which as\r\nunjust are repealed and abrogated. And to say the truth, this nation\r\nwas never in quiet, until king Henry 7th. their own countryman,\r\nobtained the crown. And yet not so really reduced in his time, as in\r\nthe reign of his son, Henry 8th. in whose time certain just laws,\r\nmade at the humble suit of the subjects of Wales, the principality\r\nand dominion of Wales was incorporated and united to the realm of\r\nEngland; and enacted that every one born in Wales should enjoy the\r\nliberties, rights and laws of this realm, as any subjects naturally\r\nborn within this realm should have and inherit, and that they should\r\nhave knights of shires, and burgesses of parliament.\" Yet we see\r\nthey could not obtain any security for their liberties, for lord\r\nCoke tells us, \"in the act of 34 Henry 8th. it was enacted, that the\r\nking's most royal majesty should, from time to time change, &c. all\r\nmanner of things in that act rehearsed, as to his most excellent\r\nwisdom and discretion should be thought convenient, and also to make\r\nlaws and ordinances for the commonwealth of his said dominion of\r\nWales at his majesty's pleasure. But for that, the subjects of the\r\ndominion of Wales, &c. had lived in all dutiful subjection to the\r\ncrown of England, &c. the said branch of the said statute of 34 Henry\r\n8th. is repealed, and made void by 21 Jac. c. 10.\"\r\n\r\nBut if we look into the statute itself of 27, Henry 8th. c. 26, we\r\nshall find the clearest proof, that being subject to the imperial\r\ncrown of England, did not entitle Welchmen to the liberties of\r\nEngland, nor make them subject to the laws of England. \"Albeit the\r\ndominion, principality and country of Wales, _justly and righteously\r\nis, and ever hath been incorporated, annexed, united, and subject\r\nto and under the imperial crown of this realm, as a very member and\r\njoint of the same_; wherefore, the king's most royal majesty of\r\nmere droit, and very right, is very head, king, lord and ruler; yet\r\nnotwithstanding, because that, in the same country, principality\r\nand dominion, diverse _rights_, _usages_, _laws_ and customs be far\r\ndiscrepant from the laws and customs of this realm, &c. Wherefore it\r\nis enacted, by king, lords and commons, \"that his\" (i. e. the king's)\r\nsaid country or dominion of Wales shall be, stand and continue\r\nforever from henceforth, incorporated, united, and annexed to and\r\nwith this, his realm of England; and that all and singular person and\r\npersons, born or to be born, in the said principality, country, or\r\ndominion of Wales, shall have, enjoy, and inherit, all and singular\r\nfreedoms, liberties, rights, privileges, and laws within this his\r\nrealm, and other the king's dominions, as other the king's subjects\r\nnaturally born within the same, have, enjoy, and inherit.\" § 2.\r\nEnacts that the laws of England shall be introduced and established\r\nin Wales: and that the laws, ordinances and statutes of this realm of\r\nEngland forever, and none other shall be used and practised forever\r\nthereafter, in the said dominion of Wales. The 27th § of this long\r\nstatute enacts, that commissioners shall inquire into the laws and\r\ncustoms of Wales, and report to the king, who with his privy council,\r\nare empowered to establish such of them as they should think proper.\r\n§ 28 Enacts that in all future parliaments _for this realm_, two\r\nknights for the shire of Monmouth, and one burgess for the town,\r\nshall be chosen and allowed such fees as other knights and burgesses\r\nof parliament were allowed. § 29 Enacts that one knight shall be\r\nelected for every shire within the country or dominion of Wales, and\r\none burgess for every shire town, to serve in that and every future\r\nparliament to be holden for this realm. But by § 36 the king is\r\nempowered to revoke, repeal and abrogate that whole act, or any part\r\nof it, at any time within three years.\r\n\r\nUpon this statute let it be observed, 1. That the language of\r\nMassachusettensis \"imperial crown\" is used in it: and Wales is\r\naffirmed to have _ever_ been annexed, and united to that imperial\r\ncrown, as a very member and joint: which shews that being annexed to\r\nthe imperial crown, does not annex a country to the realm, or make\r\nit subject to the authority of parliament: because Wales certainly,\r\nbefore the conquest of Lewellyn, never was pretended to be so\r\nsubject, nor afterwards ever pretended to be annexed to the realm\r\nat all, nor subject to the authority of parliament, any otherwise\r\nthan as the king claimed to be absolute in Wales, and therefore to\r\nmake laws for it, by his mere will, either with the advice of his\r\nproceres, or without. 2. That Wales never was incorporated with\r\nthe realm of England, until this statute was made, nor subject to\r\nany authority of English lords and commons. 3. That the king was\r\nso tenacious of his exclusive power over Wales, that he would not\r\nconsent to this statute, without a clause in it, to retain the power\r\nin his own hands, of giving it what system of law he pleased. 4.\r\nThat knights and burgesses, i. e. representatives, were considered\r\nas _essential_ and _fundamental_ in the constitution of the new\r\nlegislature, which was to govern Wales. 5. That since this statute,\r\nthe distinction between the realm of England and the realm of Wales,\r\nhas been abolished, and the realm of England, now, and ever since,\r\ncomprehends both; so that Massachusettensis is mistaken, when he\r\nsays, that the realm of England is an appropriate term for the\r\nancient realm of England, in contradistinction from Wales, &c. 6.\r\nThat this union and incorporation was made by the consent, and upon\r\nthe supplication of the people of Wales, as lord Coke and many other\r\nauthors inform us, so that here was an express contract between\r\nthe two bodies of people. To these observations let me add a few\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\nWas there ever any act of parliament, annexing, uniting, and\r\nconsolidating any one of all the colonies to and with the realm\r\nof England or the kingdom of Great Britain? 2. If such an act of\r\nparliament should be made, would it upon any principles of English\r\nlaws and government, have any validity, without the consent,\r\npetition, or supplication of the colonies? 3. Can such an union\r\nand incorporation, ever be made, upon any principles of English\r\nlaws and government, without admitting representatives for the\r\ncolonies in the house of commons, and American lords into the house\r\nof peers? 4. Would not representatives in the house of commons,\r\nunless they were numerous in proportion to the numbers of people in\r\nAmerica, be a snare rather than a blessing? 5. Would Britain ever\r\nagree to a proportionable number of American members, and if she\r\nwould, could America support the expense of them? 6. Could American\r\nrepresentatives possibly know the sense, the exigencies, &c. of their\r\nconstituents, at such a distance, so perfectly as it is absolutely\r\nnecessary legislators should know? 7. Could Americans ever come to\r\nthe knowledge of the behaviour of their members, so as to dismiss the\r\nunworthy? 8. Would Americans, in general, ever submit to septennial\r\nelections? 9. Have we not sufficient evidence, in the general\r\nfrailty and depravity of human nature, and especially the experience\r\nwe have had of Massachusettensis and the junto, that a deep,\r\ntreacherous, plausible, corrupt minister, would be able to seduce our\r\nmembers to betray us, as fast as we could send them?\r\n\r\nTo return to Wales. In the statute of 34 and 35 of Henry 8th. c. 26.\r\nwe find a more complete system of laws and regulations for Wales.\r\nBut the king is still tenacious of his absolute authority over it.\r\nIt begins, \"our sovereign lord the king, of his tender zeal and\r\naffection, &c. to his obedient subjects, &c. of Wales, &c. _hath\r\ndevised and made_ divers sundry good and necessary ordinances, which\r\nhis majesty of his most abundant goodness, _at the humble suit and\r\npetition of his said subjects of Wales_, is pleased and contented to\r\nbe enacted by the assent of the lords spiritual and temporal, and the\r\ncommons,\" &c.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the king would not yet give up his unlimited power\r\nover Wales, for by the 119 § of this statute, the king, &c. may at\r\nall times, hereafter, from time to time, change, add, alter, order,\r\nminish, and reform all manner of things afore rehearsed, as to his\r\nmost excellent wisdom and discretion, shall be thought convenient;\r\nand also to make laws and ordinances for the commonwealth and good\r\nquiet of his said dominion of Wales, and his subjects of the same,\r\nfrom time to time, at his majesty's pleasure.\r\n\r\nAnd this last section was never repealed, until the 21 Jac. 1. c. 10.\r\n§ 4.\r\n\r\nFrom the conquest of Lewellyn to this statute of James is near 350\r\nyears, during all which time the Welch were very fond of being\r\nincorporated and enjoying the English laws; the English were desirous\r\nthat they should be, yet the crown would never suffer it to be\r\ncompletely done, because it claimed an authority to rule it by\r\ndiscretion. It is conceived, therefore, that there cannot be a more\r\ncomplete and decisive proof of any thing, than this instance is, that\r\na country may be subject to the crown of England, the imperial crown;\r\nand yet not annexed to the realm, or subject to the authority of\r\nparliament.\r\n\r\nThe word crown, like the word throne, is used in various figurative\r\nsenses; sometimes it means the kingly office, the head of the\r\ncommonwealth, but it does not always mean the political capacity\r\nof the king; much less does it include in the idea of it lords and\r\ncommons. It may as well be pretended that the house of commons\r\nincludes or implies a king. Nay, it may as well be pretended that the\r\nmace includes the three branches of the legislature.\r\n\r\nBy the feudal law, a person or a country might be subject to a king,\r\na feudal sovereign, three several ways.\r\n\r\n1. It might be subject to his person, and in this case, it would\r\ncontinue so subject, let him be where he would, in his dominions\r\nor without. 2. To his crown, and in this case subjection was due,\r\nto whatsoever person or family wore that crown, and would follow\r\nit, whatever revolutions it underwent. 3. To his crown and realm of\r\nstate, and in this case, it was incorporated as one body with the\r\nprincipal kingdom; and if that was bound by a parliament, diet, or\r\ncortes, so was the other.\r\n\r\nIt is humbly conceived, that the subjection of the colonies by\r\ncompact, and law is of the second sort.\r\n\r\nSuffer me, my friends, to conclude by making my most respectful\r\ncompliments to the gentlemen of the regiment of royal Welch\r\nfusileers.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: One of the Regiments then in Boston.--_Note by the\r\nPublishers._]\r\n\r\nIn the celebration of their late festival, they discovered that they\r\nare not insensible of the feelings of a man for his native country.\r\nThe most generous minds are the most exquisitely capable of this\r\nsentiment. Let me entreat them to recollect the history of their\r\nbrave and intrepid countrymen, who struggled at least 1100 years\r\nfor liberty. Let them compare the case of Wales with the case of\r\nAmerica, and then lay their hands upon their hearts and say, whether\r\nwe can in justice be bound by all acts of parliament, without being\r\nincorporated with the kingdom.\r\n\r\nNOVANGLUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESSED\r\n\r\n_To the Inhabitants of the Colony of Massachusetts Bay_,\r\n\r\nMarch 27, 1775.\r\n\r\n\r\nMY FRIENDS,\r\n\r\nMassachusettensis in some of his writings has advanced, that our\r\nallegiance is due to the political capacity of the king, and\r\ntherefore involves in it obedience to the British parliament. Gov.\r\nHutchinson, in his memorable speech, laid down the same position. I\r\nhave already shewn, from the case of Wales, that this position is\r\ngroundless, and that allegiance was due from the Welch to the king,\r\n_jure feodali_, before the conquest of Lewellyn, and after that to\r\nthe crown, until it was annexed to the realm, without being subject\r\nto acts of parliament any more than to acts of the king, without\r\nparliament. I shall hereafter shew from the case of Ireland, that\r\nsubjection to the crown implies no obedience to parliament. But\r\nbefore I come to this, I must take notice of a pamphlet, entitled\r\n\"A candid examination of the mutual claims of Great Britain and\r\nthe colonies, with a plan of accommodation on constitutional\r\nprinciples.\" This author, p. 8, says, \"to him (i. e. the king) in\r\nhis representative capacity, and as supreme executor of the laws,\r\nmade by a joint power of him and others, the oaths of allegiance\r\nare taken,\" and afterwards: \"hence these professions, (i. e. of\r\nallegiance) are not made to him either in his legislative, or\r\nexecutive capacities; but yet it seems they are made to the king.\r\nAnd into this distinction, _which is no where to be found_ either in\r\nthe constitution of the government, in reason or common sense, the\r\nignorant and thoughtless have been deluded ever since the passing of\r\nthe stamp act, and they have rested satisfied with it without the\r\nleast examination.\" And in p. 9, he says, \"I do not mean to offend\r\nthe inventers of this refined distinction, when I ask them, is this\r\nacknowledgement made to the king, in his politic capacity as king\r\nof Great Britain, &c.? if so, it includes a promise of obedience to\r\nthe British laws.\" There is no danger of this gentleman's giving\r\noffence to the inventers of this distinction, for they have been many\r\ncenturies in their graves. This distinction is to be found every\r\nwhere. In the case of Wales, Ireland, and elsewhere, as I shall shew\r\nmost abundantly before I have done, it is to be found in two of the\r\ngreatest cases, and most deliberate and solemn judgments that were\r\never passed. One of them is Calvin's case, 7 Rep. which, as lord Coke\r\ntells us, was as elaborately, substantially, and judiciously argued,\r\nas he ever heard, or read of any. After it had been argued in the\r\ncourt of king's bench, by learned council, it was adjourned to the\r\nexchequer chamber, and there argued again, first by council on both\r\nsides, and then by the lord chancellor, and all the twelve judges of\r\nEngland, and among these were the greatest men, that Westminster-Hall\r\never could boast. Ellismore, Bacon, Hide, Hobart, Crook, and Coke,\r\nwere all among them: and the chancellor and judges were unanimous\r\nin resolving. What, says the book? 7. Rep. 10. \"Now seeing the king\r\nhath but one person, and several capacities, and one politic capacity\r\nfor the realm of England, and another for the realm of Scotland, it\r\nis necessary to be considered to which capacity _ligeance_ is due.\r\n_And it was resolved_ that it was due to the _natural person_ of the\r\nking (which is ever accompanied with the politic capacity, and the\r\npolitic capacity as it were appropriated to the natural capacity) and\r\nit is not due to the politic capacity only, that is, to the crown or\r\nkingdom, distinct from his natural capacity.\" And further on 7. Rep.\r\n11. \"But it was clearly resolved by all the judges, that presently by\r\nthe descent his majesty was completely and absolutely king,\" &c. and\r\nthat coronation was but a royal ornament. 6. \"In the reign of Edward\r\n2d. the Spencers, to cover the treason hatched in their hearts,\r\ninvented this damnable and damned opinion, that homage and oath of\r\nallegiance was more by reason of the king's crown, (that is of his\r\npolitic capacity) than by reason of the person of the king, upon\r\nwhich opinion they inferred execrable and detestable consequences.\"\r\nAnd afterwards, 12. \"Where books and acts of parliament speak of the\r\nligeance of England, &c. speaking briefly in a vulgar manner, are to\r\nbe understood of the ligeance due by the people of England to the\r\nking; for no man will affirm, that England itself, taking it for the\r\ncontinent thereof, doth owe any ligeance or faith, or that _any faith\r\nor ligeance should be due to it_: but it manifestly appeareth, that\r\nthe ligeance or faith of the subject is _proprium quarto modo_ to\r\nthe king, _omni, soli, et semper_. And oftentimes in the reports of\r\nour book cases, and in acts of parliament also, the crown or kingdom\r\nis taken for the king himself,\" &c. \"Tenure in _capite_ is a tenure\r\nof the crown, and is a _seigniorie in grosse_, that is of the person\r\nof the king.\" And afterwards 6, \"for special purposes _the law makes\r\nhim a body politic, immortal and invisible, whereunto our allegiance\r\ncannot appertain_.\" I beg leave to observe here, that these words in\r\nthe foregoing adjudication, that \"the natural person of the king is\r\never accompanied with the politic capacity, and the politic capacity\r\nas it were appropriated to the natural capacity,\" neither imply nor\r\ninfer allegiance or subjection to the politic capacity; because in\r\nthe case of king James 1st. his natural person was \"accompanied\" with\r\nthree politic capacities at least, as king of England, Scotland, and\r\nIreland: yet the allegiance of an Englishman to him did not imply or\r\ninfer subjection to his politic capacity, as king of Scotland.\r\n\r\nAnother place in which this distinction is to be found is in Moore's\r\nreports, p. 790. \"The case of the union of the realm of Scotland\r\nwith England.\" And this deliberation, I hope was solemn enough. This\r\ndistinction was agreed on by commissioners of the English lords\r\nand commons in a conference with commissioners of the Scottish\r\nparliament, and after many arguments and consultations by the lord\r\nchancellor and all the judges, and afterwards adopted by the lords\r\nand commons of both nations. \"The judges answered with one assent,\r\nsays the book, that allegiance and laws were not of equiparation for\r\nsix causes;\" the sixth and last of which is, \"allegiance followeth\r\nthe _natural person_ not the politick.\" \"If the king go out of\r\nEngland with a company of his servants, allegiance remaineth among\r\nhis subjects and servants, although he be out of his own realm,\r\n_whereto his laws are confined_, &c. and to prove the allegiance to\r\nbe tied to the body natural of the king, not to the body politic,\r\nthe lord Coke cited the phrases of diverse statutes, &c. And to\r\nprove that allegiance extended further than the laws national,\r\nthey (the judges) shewed that every king of diverse kingdoms, or\r\ndukedoms, is to command every people to defend any of his kingdoms,\r\nwithout respect of that nation where he is born; as if the king of\r\nSpain be invaded in Portugal, he may levy for defence of Portugal\r\narmies out of Spain, Naples, Castile, Milan, Flanders and the like;\r\nas a thing incident to the allegiance of all his subjects, to join\r\ntogether in defence of any of his territories, without respect of\r\nthe extent of the laws of that nation where he was born; whereby it\r\nmanifestly appeareth, that allegiance followeth the natural person\r\nof the king, and is not tied to the body politick respectively in\r\nevery kingdom. There is one observation, not immediately to the\r\npresent point, but so connected with our controversy, that it ought\r\nnot to be overlooked. \"For the matter of the great seal, the judges\r\nshewed that the seal was alterable by the king at his pleasure,\r\nand he might make one seal for both kingdoms, for seals, coin, and\r\nleagues, and of absolute prerogative of the king without parliament,\r\nnor restrained to any assent of the people.\" \"But for further\r\nresolution of this point, how far the great seal doth command out\r\nof England, they made this distinction, that the great seal was\r\ncurrent for remedials, which groweth on complaint of the subjects,\r\nand thereupon writs are addressed under the great seal of England,\r\nwhich writs are limited, their precinct to be within the places of\r\nthe jurisdiction of the court, that was to give the redress of the\r\nwrong. And therefore writs are not to go into Ireland nor the Isles,\r\nnor Wales, nor the counties palatine, because the king's courts here\r\nhave not power to hold plea of lands, nor things there. But the great\r\nseal hath a power preceptory, to the person, which power extendeth\r\nto any place, where the person may be found.\" Ludlow's case, &c. who\r\nbeing at Rome, a commandment under the great seal was sent for him\r\nto return.\" So Bertie's case in queen Mary's time, and Inglefield's\r\ncase in queen Elizabeth's, the privy seal went to command them to\r\nreturn into the realm, and for not coming their lands were seized,\"\r\n&c. But to return to the point: \"And as to the objection,\" says the\r\nbook, \"that none can be born a natural subject of two kingdoms, they\r\ndenied that absolutely, for although locally, he can be born but in\r\none, yet effectually, the allegiance of the king extending to both,\r\nhis birthright shall extend to both.\" And afterwards, \"but that his\r\nkingly power extendeth to diverse nations and kingdoms, all owe\r\nhim equal subjection, and are equally born to the benefit of his\r\nprotection; and although he is to govern them by _their distinct\r\nlaws_, yet any one of the people coming into the other, is to have\r\nthe benefit of the laws, wheresoever he cometh; but living in one,\r\nor for his livelihood in one, he is not to be taxed in the other,\r\nbecause laws ordain taxes, impositions, and charges, as a discipline\r\nof subjection particularized to every particular nation.\" Another\r\nplace where this distinction is to be found is in Foster's crown\r\nlaw, p. 184. \"There have been writers, who have carried the notion\r\nof natural, perpetual, unalienable allegiance much farther than the\r\nsubject of this discourse will lead me. They say, very truly, that\r\nit is due to the _person_ of the king, &c.\" It is undoubtedly due\r\nto the person of the king; but in that respect natural allegiance\r\ndiffereth nothing from what we call local. For allegiance considered\r\nin every light is alike due to the person of the king; and is paid,\r\nand in the nature of things must be constantly paid, to that prince,\r\nwho for time being, is in the actual and full possession of the regal\r\ndignity.\"\r\n\r\nIndeed allegiance to a sovereign lord, is nothing more than fealty\r\nto a subordinate lord, and in neither case, has any relation to, or\r\nconnection with laws or parliaments, lords or commons. There was a\r\nreciprocal confidence between the lord and vassal. The lord was to\r\nprotect the vassal in the enjoyment of his land. The vassal was to\r\nbe faithful to his lord, and defend him against his enemies. This\r\nobligation on the part of the vassal, was his fealty, _fidelitas_.\r\nThe oath of fealty, by the feodal law to be taken by the vassal\r\nor tenant, is nearly in the very words as the ancient oath of\r\nallegiance. But neither fealty, allegiance, or the oath of either\r\nimplied any thing about laws, parliaments, lords or commons.\r\n\r\nThe fealty and allegiance of Americans then is undoubtedly due to the\r\nperson of king George the third, whom God long preserve and prosper.\r\nIt is due to him, in his natural person, as that natural person is\r\nintituled to the crown, the kingly office, the royal dignity of the\r\nrealm of England. And it becomes due to his natural person, because\r\nhe is intituled to that office. And because by the charters, and\r\nother express and implied contracts made between the Americans and\r\nthe kings of England, they have bound themselves to fealty and\r\nallegiance to the natural person of that prince, who shall rightfully\r\nhold the kingly office in England, and no otherwise.\r\n\r\n\"With us in England, says Blackstone, v. 1, 367. it becoming a\r\nsettled principle of tenure, that all lands in the kingdom are holden\r\nof the king as their sovereign and lord paramount, &c. the oath\r\nof allegiance was necessarily confined to the person of the king\r\nalone. By an easy analogy, the term of allegiance was soon brought\r\nto signify all other engagements, which are due from subjects simply\r\nand merely territorial. And the oath of allegiance, as administered\r\nfor upwards of six hundred years, contained a promise to be true and\r\nfaithful to the king and his heirs, and truth and faith to bear of\r\nlife and limb and terrene honor, and not to know, or hear of any ill\r\nor damages intended him, without defending him therefrom.\" But at the\r\nrevolution, the terms of this oath being thought perhaps to favor too\r\nmuch the notion of non-resistance, the present form was introduced by\r\nthe convention parliament, which is more general and indeterminate\r\nthan the former, the subject promising \"that he will be faithful, and\r\nbear true allegiance to only the king,\" without mentioning his heirs,\r\nor specifying the least wherein that allegiance consists.\r\n\r\nThus I think that all the authorities in law, coincide exactly with\r\nthe observation which I have heretofore made upon the case of Wales,\r\nand shew that subjection to a king of England does not necessarily\r\nimply subjection to the crown of England; and that subjection to\r\nthe crown of England, does not imply subjection to the parliament\r\nof England; for allegiance is due to the person of the king, and to\r\nthat alone, in all three cases, that is, whether we are subject to\r\nhis parliament and crown, as well as his person, as the people in\r\nEngland are, whether we are subject to his crown and person, without\r\nparliament, as the Welch were after the conquest of Lewellyn, and\r\nbefore the union, or as the Irish were after the conquest and before\r\nPoyning's law, or whether we are subject to his person alone, as the\r\nScots were to the king of England, after the accession of James 1st.\r\nbeing not at all subject to the parliament or crown of England.\r\n\r\nWe do not admit any binding authority in the decisions and\r\nadjudications of the court of king's bench or common pleas, or the\r\ncourt of chancery over America: but we quote them as the opinions\r\nof learned men. In these we find a distinction between a country\r\nconquered, and a country discovered. Conquest, they say, gives the\r\ncrown an absolute power: discovery, only gives the subject a right\r\nto all the laws of England. They add, that all the laws of England\r\nare in force there. I confess I do not see the reason of this. There\r\nare several cases in books of law which may be properly thrown before\r\nthe public. I am no more of a lawyer than Massachusettensis, but have\r\ntaken his advice, and conversed with many lawyers upon our subject,\r\nsome honest, some dishonest, some living, some dead, and am willing\r\nto lay before you what I have learned from all of them. In Salk. 411,\r\nthe case of Blankard and Galdy. \"In debt upon a bond, the defendant\r\nprayed oyer of the condition, and pleaded the statutes E. 6. against\r\nbuying offices concerning the administration of justice; and averred\r\nthat this bond was given for the purchase of the office of provost\r\nmarshal in Jamaica, and that it concerned the administration of\r\njustice, and _that Jamaica is part of the revenue and possessions\r\nof the crown of England_. The plaintiff replied, that Jamaica is an\r\nisland _beyond the seas_, which was conquered from the Indians and\r\nSpaniards in Queen Elizabeth's time, and the inhabitants are governed\r\nby their own laws, and not by the laws of England. The defendant\r\nrejoined, that before such conquest, they were governed by their own\r\nlaws; but since that, by the laws of England. Shower argued for the\r\nplaintiff, that on a judgment in Jamaica, no writ of error lies here,\r\nbut only an appeal to the council; _and as they are not represented\r\nin our parliament, so they are not bound by our statutes_, unless\r\nspecially named. Vid. And. 115. Pemberton contra argued, that, _by\r\nthe conquest of a nation, its liberties, rights, and properties, are\r\nquite lost_; that by consequence their laws are lost too, for the law\r\nis but the rule and guard of the other; those that conquer cannot, by\r\ntheir victory, lose their laws, and become subject to others. Vid.\r\nVaugh. 405. That error lies here upon a judgment in Jamaica, which\r\ncould not be, if they were not under the same law. Et. per Holt,\r\nC. J. and Cur. 1st. In case of an uninhabited country, newly found\r\nout by English subjects, all laws in force in England are in force\r\nthere; so it seemed to be agreed. 2. Jamaica being conquered, and\r\nnot pleaded to be parcel of the kingdom of England, but part of the\r\npossessions and revenue of the crown of England; the laws of England\r\ndid not take place there, until declared so by the conqueror, or his\r\nsuccessors. The Isle of Man and Ireland are part of the _possessions_\r\nof the crown of England, yet retain their ancient laws, that in\r\nDavis, 36, it is not pretended that the custom of tanistry was\r\ndetermined by the conquest of Ireland, but by the new settlement\r\nmade there after the conquest: that it was impossible the laws of\r\nthis nation, by mere conquest, without more should take place, in\r\na conquered country, because for a time, there must want officers,\r\nwithout which our laws can have no force; that if our law did take\r\nplace, yet they, in Jamaica, having power to make new laws, our\r\ngeneral laws may be altered by theirs in particulars; also they held\r\nthat in case of an infidel country; their laws by conquest do not\r\nentirely cease, but only such as are against the law of God; and that\r\nin such cases where the laws are rejected or silent, the conquered\r\ncountry shall be governed according to the rule of natural equity.\r\nJudgment, pro quer.\"\r\n\r\nUpon this case I beg leave to make a few observations. 1. That\r\nShower's reasoning, that we are not bound by statutes, because not\r\nrepresented in parliament, is universal, and therefore his exception,\r\n\"unless specially named,\" although it is taken from analogy to the\r\ncase of Ireland, by lord Coke and others, yet it is not taken from\r\nthe common law, but is merely arbitrary and groundless, as applied\r\nto us: because, if the want of representation could be supplied, by\r\n\"expressly naming\" a country, the right of representation might be\r\nrendered null and nugatory. But of this, more another time.\r\n\r\n2. That by the opinion of Holt, and the whole court, the laws of\r\nEngland, common and statute, are in force in a vacant country,\r\ndiscovered by Englishmen. But America was not a vacant country; it\r\nwas full of inhabitants; our ancestors purchased the land; but if\r\nit had been vacant, his lordship has not shewn us any authority at\r\ncommon law, that the laws of England would have been in force there.\r\nOn the contrary, by that law, it is clear they did not extend beyond\r\nseas, and therefore could not be binding there, any further than the\r\nfree will of the discoverers should make them. The discoverers had\r\na right by nature, to set up those laws, if they liked them, or any\r\nothers, that pleased them better, provided they were not inconsistent\r\nwith their allegiance to the king. 3. The court held that a country\r\nmust be parcel of the kingdom of England, before the laws of England\r\ncould take place there; which seems to be inconsistent with what is\r\nsaid before, because discovery of a vacant country does not make\r\nit parcel of the kingdom of England, which shews, that the court,\r\nwhen they said that all laws in _force_ in England, are in _force_\r\nin the discovered country, meant no more than that the discoverers\r\nhad a right to all such laws, if they chose to adopt them. 4. The\r\nidea of the court, in this case, is exactly conformable to, if not\r\ntaken from the case of Wales. They consider a conquered country as\r\nEdward 1st. and his successors did Wales, as by the conquest annexed\r\nto the crown, as an absolute property, possession, or revenue,\r\nand therefore to be disposed of at its will; not entitled to the\r\nlaws of England, although bound to be governed by the king's will,\r\nin parliament or out of it, as he pleased. 5. The Isle of Man and\r\nIreland, are considered like Wales, as conquered countries, and part\r\nof the possessions (by which they mean property or revenue) of the\r\ncrown of England, yet have been allowed by the king's will to retain\r\ntheir ancient laws. 6. That the case of America differs totally from\r\nthe case of Wales, Ireland, Man, or any other case, which is known\r\nat common law, or in English history. There is no one precedent in\r\npoint, in any English records, and therefore it can be determined\r\nonly by eternal reason, and the law of nature. But yet that the\r\nanalogy of all these cases of Ireland, Wales, Man, Chester, Durham,\r\nLancaster, &c. clearly concur with the dictates of reason and nature,\r\nthat Americans are entitled to all the liberties of Englishmen, and\r\nthat they are not bound by any acts of parliament whatever, by any\r\nlaw known in English records or history, excepting those for the\r\nregulation of trade, which they have consented to and acquiesced\r\nin. 7. To these let me add, that as the laws of England, and the\r\nauthority of parliament were by common law confined to the realm, and\r\nwithin the four seas, so was the force of the great seal of England.\r\nSalk. 510. \"The great seal of England is appropriated to England,\r\nand what is done under it has relation to England, and to no other\r\nplace.\" So that the king, by common law, had no authority to create\r\npeers or governments, or any thing out of the realm, by his great\r\nseal; and therefore our charters and commissions to governors, being\r\nunder the great seal, gives us no more authority, nor binds us to any\r\nother duties, than if they had been given under the privy seal, or\r\nwithout any seal at all. Their binding force, both upon the crown and\r\nus, is wholly from compact and the law of nature.\r\n\r\nThere is another case in which the same sentiments are preserved; it\r\nis in 2. P. Williams, 75, memorandum 9th August, 1722. It was said\r\nby the master of the rolls to have been determined by the lords of\r\nthe privy council, upon an appeal to the king in council from the\r\nforeign plantations. 1st. That if there be a new and uninhabited\r\ncountry, found out by English subjects, as the law is the birth\r\nright of every subject, so, wherever they go, they carry their laws\r\nwith them, and therefore such new found country is to be governed\r\nby the laws of England; though after such country is inhabited by\r\nthe English, acts of parliament made in England, without naming the\r\nforeign plantations, will not bind them; for which reason it has been\r\ndetermined that the statute of frauds and perjuries, which requires\r\nthree witnesses, and that these should subscribe in the testators\r\npresence in the case of devise of land, does not bind Barbadoes,\r\nbut that 2dly. Where the king of England conquers a country, it is\r\na different consideration; for there the conqueror, by saving the\r\nlives of the people conquered, gains a right and property in such\r\npeople! In consequence of which he may impose upon them what laws he\r\npleases. But 3dly. Until such laws, given by the conquering prince,\r\nthe laws and customs of the conquered country shall hold place,\r\nunless where these are contrary to our religion, or enact any thing\r\nthat is _malum in se_, or are silent; for in all such cases the laws\r\nof the conquering country shall prevail.\r\n\r\nNOVANGLUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESSED\r\n\r\n_To the Inhabitants of the Colony of Massachusetts Bay_,\r\n\r\nApril 3, 1775.\r\n\r\n\r\nMY FRIENDS,\r\n\r\nGive me leave now to descend from these general matters, to\r\nMassachusettensis. He says \"Ireland, who has perhaps the greatest\r\npossible subordinate legislature, and sends no members to the British\r\nparliament, is bound by its acts when expressly named.\" But if we are\r\nto consider what ought to be, as well as what is, why should Ireland\r\nhave the greatest possible subordinate legislature? Is Ireland more\r\nnumerous and more important to what is called the British empire,\r\nthan America? Subordinate as the Irish legislature is said to be, and\r\na conquered country as undoubtedly it is, the parliament of Great\r\nBritain, although they claim a power to bind Ireland by statutes,\r\nhave never laid one farthing of tax upon it. They knew it would\r\noccasion resistance if they should. But the authority of parliament\r\nto bind Ireland at all, if it has any, is founded upon a different\r\nprinciple entirely from any that takes place in the case of America.\r\nIt is founded on the consent and compact of the Irish by Poyning's\r\nlaw to be so governed, if it has any foundation at all: and this\r\nconsent was given and compact made in consequence of a conquest.\r\n\r\nIn the reign of Henry 2d of England, there were five distinct\r\nsovereignties in Ireland; Munster, Leinster, Meath, Ulster and\r\nConnaught, besides several small tribes. As the prince of any one of\r\nthese petty states took the lead in war, he seemed to act, for the\r\ntime being, as monarch of the island. About the year 1172, Roderic\r\nO'Connor, king of Connaught, was advanced to this pre-eminence. Henry\r\nhad long cast a wishful eye upon Ireland, and now partly to divert\r\nhis subjects from the thoughts of Becket's murder, partly to appease\r\nthe wrath of the pope for the same event, and partly to gratify his\r\nown ambition, he lays hold of a pretence, that the Irish had taken\r\nsome natives of England and sold them for slaves, applies to the pope\r\nfor license to invade that island. Adrian the 3d, an Englishman by\r\nbirth, who was then pontiff, and very clearly convinced in his own\r\nmind, of his right to dispose of kingdoms and empires, was easily\r\npersuaded, by the prospect of Peter's pence, to act as emperor of the\r\nworld, and make an addition to his ghostly jurisdiction of an island\r\nwhich, though converted to christianity, had never acknowledged any\r\nsubjection to the see of Rome. He issued a bull, premising that\r\nHenry had ever shewn an anxious care to enlarge the church, and\r\nincrease the saints on earth and in heaven: that his design upon\r\nIreland proceeded from the same pious motives: that his application\r\nto the holy see, was a sure earnest of success: that it was a point\r\nincontestible, that all christian kingdoms belonged to the patrimony\r\nof St. Peter: that it was his duty to sow among them the seeds of the\r\ngospel, which might fructify to their eternal salvation. He exhorts\r\nHenry to invade Ireland, exterminate the vices of the natives, and\r\noblige them to pay yearly, from every house, a penny to the see\r\nof Rome; gives him full right and entire authority over the whole\r\nisland; and commands all to obey him as their sovereign.\r\n\r\nMacmorrough, a licentious scoundrel, who was king of Leinster, had\r\nbeen driven from his kingdom, for his tyranny, by his own subjects,\r\nin conjunction with Ororic, king of Meath, who made war upon him for\r\ncommitting a rape upon his queen, applied to Henry for assistance,\r\nto restore him, and promised to hold his kingdom in vassalage of the\r\ncrown of England.\r\n\r\nHenry accepted the offer and engaged in the enterprise. It is\r\nunnecessary to recapitulate all the intrigues of Henry, to divide\r\nthe Irish kingdoms among themselves, and set one against another,\r\nwhich are as curious as those of Edward 1st. to divide the kingdom\r\nof Wales, and play Lewellyn's brothers against him, or as those of\r\nthe ministry, and our junto, to divide the American colonies, who\r\nhave more sense than to be divided. It is sufficient to say, that\r\nHenry's expeditions terminated altogether by means of those divisions\r\namong the Irish, in the total conquest of Ireland, and its annexation\r\nforever to the English crown. By the annexation of all Ireland to the\r\nEnglish crown, I mean that all the princes and petty sovereigns in\r\nIreland agreed to become vassals of the English crown. But what was\r\nthe consequence of this? The same consequence was drawn, by the kings\r\nof England in this case, as had been drawn in the case of Wales after\r\nthe conquest of Lewellyn, viz: that Ireland was become part of the\r\n_property_, _possession_ or _revenue_ of the English crown, and that\r\nits authority over it was absolute and without controul.\r\n\r\nThat matter must be traced from step to step. The first monument we\r\nfind in English records, concerning Ireland, is a mere _rescriptum\r\nprincipis_, intituled _statutum Hiberniae de coheredibus_, 14, Henry\r\n3d, A. D. 1229. In the old abridgment Tit. Homage, this is said not\r\nto be a statute. Vid. Ruffhead's statutes at large, V. 1. 15. Mr. Cay\r\nvery properly observes, that it is not an act of parliament, Vid.\r\nBarrington's observations on the statutes, p. 34. In this rescript,\r\nthe king informs certain milites, (adventurers probably in the\r\nconquest of Ireland, or their descendants) who had doubts how lands\r\nholden by knights' service descending to co-partners, within age,\r\nshould be divided, what is the law and custom in England with regard\r\nto this.\r\n\r\nBut the record itself shews it to be a royal rescript only. _Rex\r\ndilecto et fideli suo gerardo fil'mauricii justii' suo [Errata:\r\ndelete 'suo'] Hiberniae salutem. Quia tales Milites de partibus\r\nHiberniae nuper, ad nos accedentes nobis ostenderunt, quod, &c. Et\r\na nobis petierunt inde certiorari qualiter in regno nostro Angliae\r\nin casu consimili hactenus usitatum sit, &c._ He then goes on and\r\ncertifies what the law in England was, and then concludes, _Et Ideo\r\nvobis mandamus, quod predictas consuetudines in hoc casu, quas in\r\nregno nostro Angliae habemus, ut predictum est, in terra nostra\r\nHiberniae proclamari et firmiter teneri, fac, &c._\r\n\r\nHere again we find the king conducting, exactly as Edward 1st. did in\r\nWales, after the conquest of Wales. Ireland had now been annexed to\r\nthe English crown many years, yet parliament was not allowed to have\r\nobtained any jurisdiction over it, and Henry ordained laws for it by\r\nhis sole and absolute authority, as Edward 1st. did by the statute\r\nof Wales. Another incontestible proof that annexing a country to the\r\ncrown of England, does not annex it to the realm, or subject it to\r\nparliament. But we shall find innumerable proofs of this.\r\n\r\nAnother incontestible proof of this, is the _ordinatio pro statu\r\nHiberniae_ made 17 Edward 1, 1288.\r\n\r\nThis is an ordinance made by the king, by advice of his council,\r\nfor the government of Ireland. \"Edward, by the grace of God, king\r\nof England, lord of Ireland, &c. to all those who shall see or hear\r\nthese letters, doth send salutation.\" He then goes on and ordains\r\nmany regulations, among which the seventh chapter is \"that none of\r\nour officers shall receive an original writ pleadable at the common\r\nlaw, but such as be sealed by the great seal of Ireland,\" &c. This\r\nordinance concludes, \"In witness whereof we have caused these our\r\nletters patent to be made.\" Dated at Nottingham 24th Nov. 17th year\r\nof our reign.\r\n\r\nThis law, if it was passed in parliament, was never considered\r\nto have any more binding force, than if it had been made only by\r\nthe king. By Poyning's law indeed in the reign of Henry 7th. all\r\nprecedent English statutes are made to bind in Ireland, and this\r\namong the rest; but until Poyning's law, it had no validity as an\r\nact of parliament, and was never executed, but in the English pale,\r\nfor, notwithstanding all that is said of the total compact [Errata:\r\nconquest] by Henry 2d.; yet it did not extend much beyond the\r\nneighbourhood of Dublin, and the conqueror could not enforce his laws\r\nand regulations much further.\r\n\r\nThere is a note on the roll of 21 Edward 1st. in these words: \"_Et\r\nmemorandum quod istud statutum, de verbo ad verbum, missum fuit in\r\nHiberniam, teste rege apud Kenyngton 14 die, Augusti, anno regni\r\nsui vicesimo septimo: et mandatum fuit Johanni Wogan justiciario\r\nHiberniae, quod praedictum statutum, per Hiberniam, in locis quibus\r\nexpedire viderit legi, et publice proclamari ac firmiter teneri\r\nfaciat_.\r\n\r\n\"This note most fully proves, that the king, by his sole authority,\r\ncould introduce any English law; and will that authority be lessened\r\nby the concurrence of the two houses of parliament? There is also\r\nan order of Charles 1st. in the third year of his reign, to the\r\ntreasurers and chancellors of the exchequer, both of England and\r\nIreland, by which they are directed to increase the duties upon\r\nIrish exports; which shews that it was then imagined, that the king\r\nwould tax Ireland by his prerogative, without the intervention of\r\nparliament.\" Vid. obs. on the statutes, p. 127.\r\n\r\nAnother instance to shew, that the king by his sole authority,\r\nwhenever he pleased, made regulations for the government of Ireland,\r\nnotwithstanding it was annexed and subject to the crown of England,\r\nis the _ordinatio facta pro statu terrae Hiberniae_, in the 31\r\nEdward 1. in the appendix to Ruffhead's statutes, p. 37. This is an\r\nextensive code of laws, made for the government of the Irish church\r\nand state, by the king alone, without lords or commons. The king's\r\n\"_volumus et firmiter precipimus_,\" governs and establishes all, and\r\namong other things, he introduces by the 18th chapter, the English\r\nlaws for the regimen of persons of English extract settled in Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe next appearance of Ireland, in the statutes of England, is in\r\nthe 34 Edward 3d, c. 17. This is no more than a concession of the\r\nking to his lords and commons of England, in these words. \"_Item_, it\r\nis accorded that all the merchants, as well aliens as denizens, may\r\ncome into Ireland, with their merchandizes, and from thence freely\r\nreturn with their merchandizes and victuals, without fine or ransom\r\nto be taken of them, saving always to the king, his ancient customs\r\nand other duties.\" And by chapter 18, \"_Item_, that the people of\r\nEngland, as well religious as other, which have their heritage and\r\npossessions in Ireland, may bring their corn, beasts and victuals to\r\nthe said land of Ireland, and from thence re-carry their goods and\r\nmerchandizes into England freely without impeachment, paying their\r\ncustoms and devoirs to the king.\"\r\n\r\nAll this is no more than an agreement between the king and his\r\nEnglish subjects, lords and commons, that there should be a free\r\ntrade between the two islands, and that one of them should be free\r\nfor strangers. But it is no colour of proof that the king could not\r\ngovern Ireland without his English lords and commons.\r\n\r\nThe 1. Henry 5th. c. 8. All Irishmen and Irish clerks, beggars, shall\r\ndepart this realm before the 1st day of November, except graduates,\r\nsergeants, &c. is explained by 1. Henry 6th. c. 3. which shews what\r\nsort of Irishmen only may come to dwell in England. It enacts that\r\nall persons, born in Ireland, shall depart out of the realm of\r\nEngland, except a few; and that Irishmen shall not be principals\r\nof any hall, and that Irishmen shall bring testimonials from the\r\nlieutenant, or justice of Ireland, that they are of the king's\r\nobeisance. By the 8th, Henry 6th. c. 8. \"Irishmen resorting into the\r\nrealm of England, shall put in surety for their goodabearing.\"\r\n\r\nThus I have cursorily mentioned every law made by the king of\r\nEngland, whether in parliament or out of it, for the government of\r\nIreland, from the conquest of it by Henry 2d. in 1172, down to the\r\nreign of Henry 7th. when an express contract was made between the two\r\nkingdoms, that Ireland should for the future be bound by English acts\r\nof parliament, in which it should be specially named. This contract\r\nwas made in 1495; so that upon the whole it appears, beyond dispute,\r\nthat for more than 300 years, though a conquered country, and annexed\r\nto the crown of England; yet was so far from being annexed to, or\r\nparcel of the realm, that the king's power was absolute there, and\r\nhe might govern it without his English parliament, whose advice\r\nconcerning it, he was under no obligation to ask or pursue.\r\n\r\nThe contract I here alluded to, is what is called Poyning's law; the\r\nhistory of which is briefly this. Ireland revolted from England,\r\nor rather adhered to the partizans of the house of York; and Sir\r\nEdward Poyning was sent over about the year 1495, by king Henry 7th.\r\nwith very extensive powers, _over the civil as well as military\r\nadministration_. On his arrival he made severe inquisition about the\r\ndisaffected, and in particular attacked the earls of Desmond and\r\nKildare. The first stood upon the defensive, and eluded the power\r\nof the deputy: but Kildare was sent prisoner to England: _not to\r\nbe executed, it seems, nor to be tried upon the statute of Henry\r\n8th_, but to be dismissed, as he actually was, to his own country,\r\nwith marks of the king's esteem and favor; Henry judging that, at\r\nsuch a juncture, he should gain more by clemency and indulgence,\r\nthan by rigor and severity. In this opinion he sent a commissioner\r\nto Ireland, with a formal amnesty, in favor of Desmond and all his\r\nadherents, whom the tools of his ministers did not fail to call\r\ntraitors and rebels, with as good a grace and as much benevolence, as\r\nMassachusettensis discovers.\r\n\r\nLet me stop here and enquire, whether lord North has more wisdom than\r\nHenry 7th. or whether he took the hint from the history of Poyning,\r\nof sending Gen. Gage, with his civil and military powers? If he\r\ndid, he certainly did not imitate Henry, in his blustering menaces,\r\nagainst certain \"ringleaders and forerunners.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Poyning resided in Ireland, he called a parliament, which is\r\nfamous in history for the acts which it passed, in favour of England,\r\nand Englishmen settled in Ireland. By these, which are still called\r\nPoyning's laws, all the former laws of England were made to be of\r\nforce in Ireland, and no bill can be introduced into the Irish\r\nparliament, unless it previously receive the sanction of the English\r\nprivy council; and by a construction, if not by the express words of\r\nthese laws, Ireland is still said to be bound by English statutes, in\r\nwhich it is specially named. Here then let Massachusettensis pause,\r\nand observe the original of the notion that countries might be bound\r\nby acts of parliament, if \"specially named,\" though without the\r\nrealm. Let him observe, too, that this notion is grounded entirely on\r\nthe voluntary act, the free consent of the Irish nation, and an act\r\nof an Irish parliament, called Poyning's law. Let me ask him, has any\r\ncolony in America ever made a Poyning's act? Have they ever consented\r\nto be bound by acts of parliament, if specially named? Have they ever\r\nacquiesced in, or implicitly consented to any acts of parliament,\r\nbut such as are _bona fide_ made for the regulation of trade? This\r\nidea of binding countries without the realm, \"by specially naming\"\r\nthem, is not an idea taken from the common law. There was no such\r\nprinciple, rule, or maxim, in that law; it must be by statute law,\r\nthen, or none. In the case of Wales and Ireland, it was introduced\r\nby solemn compact, and established by statutes, to which the Welch\r\nand Irish were parties, and expressly consented. But in the case of\r\nAmerica there is no such statute, and therefore Americans are bound\r\nby statutes, in which they are \"named,\" no more than by those in\r\nwhich they are not.\r\n\r\nThe principle upon which Ireland is bound by English statutes, in\r\nwhich it is named, is this, that being a conquered country, and\r\nsubject to the mere will of the king, it voluntarily consented to\r\nbe so bound. This appears in part already, and more fully in 1.\r\nBlackstone 99, 100, &c. who tells us, \"that Ireland is a distinct,\r\nthough a dependant, subordinate kingdom.\" But how came it dependant\r\nand subordinate? He tells us \"that king John, in the twelfth year\r\nof his reign, after the conquest, went into Ireland, carried over\r\nwith him many able sages of the law; and there, by his letters\r\npatent, in right of the dominion of conquest, is said to have\r\nordained and established, that Ireland should be governed by the\r\nlaws of England; which letters patent Sir Edward Coke apprehends\r\nto have been there confirmed in parliament.\" By the same rule that\r\nno laws made in England, between king John's time and Poyning's\r\nlaw, were then binding in Ireland, it follows that no acts of the\r\nEnglish parliament, made since the tenth of Henry 7th. do now bind\r\nthe people of Ireland, unless specially named, or included under\r\ngeneral words. And on the other hand, it is equally clear, that where\r\nIreland is particularly named, or is included under general words,\r\nthey are bound by such acts of parliament; for it follows, from the\r\nvery nature and constitution of a dependent state; dependance being\r\nvery little else, but an obligation to conform to the will or law of\r\nthat superior person, or state, upon which the inferior depends. The\r\noriginal and true ground of this superiority, in the present case,\r\nis what we usually call, though somewhat improperly, \"the right of\r\nconquest;\" a right allowed by the law of nations, if not by that of\r\nnature; but which in reason and civil policy can mean nothing more,\r\nthan that, in order to put an end to hostilities, \"a compact is\r\neither expressly or tacitly made between the conqueror and conquered,\r\nthat if they will acknowledge the victor for their master, he will\r\ntreat them for the future as subjects and not as enemies.\"\r\n\r\nThese are the principles upon which the dependance and subordination\r\nof Ireland are founded. Whether they are just or not, is not\r\nnecessary for us to enquire. The Irish nation have never been\r\nentirely convinced of their justice; have been ever discontented with\r\nthem; and ripe and ready to dispute them. Their reasonings have ever\r\nbeen answered, by the _ratio ultima and penultima_ of the tories, and\r\nit requires to this hour no less than a standing army of 12,000 men\r\nto confute them; as little as the British parliament exercises the\r\nright, which it claims of binding them by statutes, and although it\r\nnever once attempted or presumed to tax them, and although they are\r\nso greatly inferior to Britain in power, and so near in situation.\r\n\r\nBut thus much is certain, that none of these principles take place,\r\nin the case of America. She never was conquered by Britain. She\r\nnever consented to be a state dependant upon, or subordinate to the\r\nBritish parliament, excepting only in the regulation of her commerce;\r\nand therefore the reasonings of British writers, upon the case of\r\nIreland, are not applicable to the case of the colonies, any more\r\nthan those upon the case of Wales.\r\n\r\nThus have I rambled after Massachusettensis through Wales and\r\nIreland, but have not reached my journey's end. I have yet to travel\r\nthrough Jersey, Guernsey, and I know not where. At present I shall\r\nconclude with one observation. In the history of Ireland and Wales,\r\nthough undoubtedly conquered countries, and under the very eye and\r\narm of England, the extreme difficulty, the utter impracticability of\r\ngoverning a people, who have any sense, spirit, or love of liberty,\r\nwithout incorporating them into the state, or allowing them in some\r\nother way, equal privileges may be clearly seen. Wales was forever\r\nrevolting for a thousand years, until it obtained that mighty\r\nblessing. Ireland has been frequently revolting, although the most\r\nessential power of a supreme legislature, that of imposing taxes,\r\nhas never been exercised over them, and it cannot now be kept under,\r\nbut by force; and it would revolt forever, if parliament should tax\r\nthem. What kind of an opinion, then, must the ministry entertain of\r\nAmerica? When her distance is so great, her territory so extensive,\r\nher commerce so important, not a conquered country, but dearly\r\npurchased and defended? When her trade is so essential to the navy,\r\nthe commerce, the revenue, the very existence of Great Britain, as\r\nan independent state? They must think America inhabited by three\r\nmillions of fools and cowards.\r\n\r\nNOVANGLUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESSED\r\n\r\n_To the Inhabitants of the Colony of Massachusetts Bay_,\r\n\r\nApril 10, 1775.\r\n\r\n\r\nMY FRIENDS,\r\n\r\nThe cases of Wales and Ireland are not yet exhausted. They afford\r\nsuch irrefragable proofs, that there is a distinction between the\r\ncrown and realm, and that a country may be annexed and subject to the\r\nformer, and not the latter, that they ought to be thoroughly studied\r\nand understood.\r\n\r\nThe more these cases, as well as those of Chester, Durham, Jersey,\r\nGuernsey, Calais, Gascoine, Guienne, &c. are examined, the more\r\nclearly it will appear, that there is no precedent in English\r\nrecords; no rule of common law; no provision in the English\r\nconstitution; no policy in the English or British government; for\r\nthe case of the colonies; and therefore that we derive our laws and\r\ngovernment solely from our own compacts with Britain and her kings,\r\nand from the great legislature of the universe.\r\n\r\nWe ought to be cautious of the inaccuracies of the greatest men, for\r\nthese are apt to lead us astray. Lord Coke, in 7 Rep. 21, 6, says,\r\n\"Wales was sometimes a kingdom, as it appeareth by 19 Henry 6th.\r\nfol. 6, and by the act of parliament of 2 Henry 5th. cap. 6, but\r\nwhile it was a kingdom, the same was holden, and within the fee of\r\nthe king of England: and this appeareth by our books, Fleta, lib.\r\n1. Edward 3d. 14, 8. Ed. 3d. 59, 13, Edward 3d. Tit. Jurisdict. 10.\r\nHenry 4, 6. Plow. com. 368. And in this respect, in divers ancient\r\ncharters, kings of old time styled themselves in several manners,\r\nas king Edgar, Britanniae Basileus, Etheldrus, Totius Albionis Dei\r\nprovidentia Imperator, Edredus, magnae Britanniae Monarcha, which,\r\namong many others of like nature I have seen. But by the statute of\r\n12 of Edward 1st. Wales was united and incorporated into England, and\r\nmade parcel of England in possession; and therefore it is ruled in\r\n7 Henry 4th. fol. 14. That no protection doth lie, _quia moratur in\r\nWallia_, because Wales is within the realm of England. And where it\r\nis recited in the act of 27 Henry 8th. _that Wales was ever parcel\r\nof the realm of England_, it is true in this sense, viz: that before\r\n12 Edward 1st. it was parcel in tenure, and since _it is parcel of\r\nthe body of the realm_. And whosoever is born within the fee of the\r\nking of England, though it be in another kingdom, is a natural born\r\nsubject, and capable and inheritable of lands in England, as it\r\nappeareth in Plow. com. 126. And therefore those that were born in\r\nWales before 12 Edward 1st. while it was only holden of England, were\r\ncapable and inheritable of lands in England.\"\r\n\r\nWhere my lord Coke or any other sage, shews us the ground on which\r\nhis opinion stands, we can judge for ourselves, whether the ground\r\nis good, and his opinion just. And if we examine by this rule, we\r\nshall find in the foregoing words, several palpable inaccuracies\r\nof expression; 1, by the 12 E. 1. (which is the _Statutum Walliæ_\r\nquoted by me before) it is certain \"that Wales was not united and\r\nincorporated into England, and made parcel of England.\" It was\r\nannexed and united to the crown of England only. It was done by the\r\nking's sole and absolute authority; not by an act of parliament, but\r\nby a mere _constitutio imperatoria_, and neither E. 1. nor any of his\r\nsuccessors, ever would relinquish the right of ruling it, by mere\r\nwill and discretion until the reign of James 1.--2. It is not recited\r\nin the 27 H. 8, that Wales was ever parcel of the realm of England.\r\nThe words of that statute are, \"incorporated, annexed, united and\r\nsubject to and under the imperial crown of this realm,\" is a decisive\r\nproof that a country may be annexed to the one, without being\r\nunited with the other. And this appears fully in lord Coke himself,\r\n7 rep. 22, b. \"Ireland originally came to the kings of England\r\nby conquest, but who was the first conquerer thereof hath been a\r\nquestion. I have seen a charter made by king Edgar, in these words,\r\n_Ego Edgarus Anglorum Basileus, omnium quæ insularum oceani, quæ\r\nBritanniam circumjacent, imperator et dominus, gratias ago ipsi Deo\r\nomnipotenti regi meo, qui meum imperium sic ampliavit et exaltavit\r\nsuper regnum patrum meorum_, &c. _Mihi concessit propitia divinitas,\r\ncum anglorum imperis omnia regna insularum oceani_, &c. _Cum suis\r\nferocibus regibus usque Norvegiam, maximamque partem Hiberniæ, cum\r\nsua nobilissima civitate de Dublina, Anglorum regno subjugare,\r\nquapropter et ego Christi gloriam et laudem in regno meo exaltare,\r\net ejus servitium amplificare devotus disposui_, &c. Yet for that it\r\nwas wholly conquered in the reign of H. 2. The honour of the conquest\r\nof Ireland is attributed to him. That Ireland is a dominion separate\r\nand divided from England it is evident by our books, 20 H. 6, 8.\r\nSir John Pilkington's case, 32 H. 6, 26. 20 Eliz. Dyer 360. Plow.\r\ncom. 360. and 2, r. 3. 12. _Hibernia habet parliamentum, et faciunt\r\nleges, et statuta nostra non ligant eos quia non mittunt milites ad\r\nparliamentum_, (which is to be understood unless they be specially\r\nnamed) _sed personæ eorum sunt, subjecti regis, sicut inhabitantes in\r\nCalesia, Gasconia et Guigan_. Wherein it is to be observed, that the\r\nIrishman (as to his subjection) is compared to men born in Calice,\r\nGascoin and Guian. Concerning their laws, _Ex rotulis petentium,\r\nde anno_ 11. Regis 8. 3, there is a charter which that king made\r\nbeginning in these words: _Rex Baronibus, Militibus et omnibus libere\r\ntenenibus L. salutem, satis, ut credimus vestra audivit discretio,\r\nquod quando bonæ memoriæ Johannes quondam rex Angliæ, pater noster\r\nvenit in Hiberniam ipse duxit secum viros discretos et legis peritos,\r\nquorum communi consilio et adjunctorum Hiberniansium, statuit et\r\npræcepit leges Anglicanas in Hibernia, ita quod easdem inscripturas\r\nredactas reliquit sub sigillo suo ad saccarium Dublin_. So as now\r\nthe laws of England became the proper laws of Ireland; and therefore\r\nbecause they have parliaments holden there, whereat they have made\r\ndiverse particular laws, concerning that dominion, as it appeareth in\r\n20 Hen. 6th, 8th. and 20 Eliz. Dyer, 360, and for that they retain\r\nunto this day, diverse of their ancient customs, the book in 20 Henry\r\n6th. 8th. holdeth that Ireland is governed by laws and customs,\r\nseparate and diverse from the laws of England. A voyage royal may be\r\nmade into Ireland. Vid. 11. Henry 4th. 7th. and 7 Edward 4th. 27.\r\nwhich proveth it a distinct dominion. And in anno 33 Elizabeth, it\r\nwas resolved by all the judges of England, in the case of Orurke,\r\nan Irishman, who had committed high treason in Ireland, that he, by\r\nthe statute of 33. Henry 8th. c. 23, might be indicted, arraigned,\r\nand tried for the same in England, according to the purview of that\r\nstatute; the words of which statute be, that all treasons, &c.\r\ncommitted by any person out of the realm of England, shall be from\r\nhenceforth enquired of, &c. And they all resolved, (as afterwards\r\nthey did also in Sir John Perrot's case) that Ireland was out of\r\nthe realm of England, and that treasons committed there were to be\r\ntried within England, by that statute. In the statute of 4 Henry\r\n7th. c. 24 of fines, provision is made for them that be out of this\r\nland, and it is holden in Plow. com. in Stowell's case 375, that he\r\nthat is in Ireland is out of this land, and consequently within that\r\nproviso. Might not, then, the like plea be devised, as well against\r\nany person born in Ireland, as (this is against Calvin a _Postnatus_)\r\nin Scotland? For the Irishman is born _extra ligeantia regis, regni\r\nsui Angliae_, &c. which be _verba operativa_ in the plea. But all\r\nmen know, that they are natural born subjects, and capable of, and\r\ninheritable to lands in England.\"\r\n\r\nI have been at the pains of transcribing this long passage for the\r\nsake of a variety of important observations that may be made upon\r\nit. 1. That exuberance of proof that is in it, both that Ireland\r\nis annexed to the crown, and that it is not annexed to the realm\r\nof England. 2. That the reasoning in the year book, that Ireland\r\nhas a parliament, and makes laws, and our statutes do not bind\r\nthem, because they do not send knights to parliament, is universal,\r\nand concludes against these statutes binding, in which Ireland is\r\nspecially named, as much as against these in which it is not, and\r\ntherefore lord Coke's parenthesis, (which is to be understood unless\r\nthey be specially named) is wholly arbitrary and groundless, unless\r\nit goes upon the supposition, that the king is absolute in Ireland,\r\nit being a conquered country, and so has power to bind it at his\r\npleasure, by an act of parliament, or by an edict: or unless it goes\r\nupon the supposition of Blackstone, that there had been an express\r\nagreement and consent of the Irish nation to be bound by acts of the\r\nEnglish parliament; and in either case it is not applicable even by\r\nanalogy to America, because that is not a conquered country, and most\r\ncertainly never consented to be bound by all acts of parliament, in\r\nwhich it should be named. 3. That the instance, request and consent\r\nof the Irish is stated, as a ground upon which king John and his\r\ndiscreet law-sages, first established the laws of England in Ireland.\r\n4. The resolution of the judges in the cases of Orurke and Perrot,\r\nis express that Ireland was without the realm of England, and the\r\nlate resolutions of both houses of parliament, and the late opinion\r\nof the judges, that Americans may be sent to England upon the same\r\nstatute to be tried for treason, is also express that America is out\r\nof the realm of England. So that we see what is to become of us, my\r\nfriends. When they want to get our money by taxing us, our privileges\r\nby annihilating our charters, and to screen those from punishment\r\nwho shall murder us at their command, then we are told that we are\r\nwithin the realm; but when they want to draw, hang, and quarter us,\r\nfor honestly defending those liberties which God and compact have\r\ngiven and secured to us, oh, then, we are clearly out of the realm.\r\n5. In Stowell's case, it is resolved that Ireland is out of the land,\r\nthat is the land of England. The consequence is, that it was out\r\nof the reach and extent of the law of the land, that is the common\r\nlaw. America surely is still further removed from that land; and\r\ntherefore is without the jurisdiction of that law which is called\r\nthe law of the land in England. I think it must appear by this time,\r\nthat America is not parcel of the realm, state, kingdom, government,\r\nempire, or land of England, or Great Britain, in any sense, which can\r\nmake it subject universally to the supreme legislature of that island.\r\n\r\nBut for the sake of curiosity, and for the purpose of shewing that\r\nthe consent even of a conquered people has always been carefully\r\nconciliated, I beg leave to look over lord Coke's 4. Inst. p. 12.\r\n\"After king Henry 2d.\" says he, \"had conquered Ireland, he fitted\r\nand transcribed this modus, meaning the ancient treatise called\r\n_modus tenendi parliamentum_, which was rehearsed and declared before\r\nthe conqueror at the time of the conquest, and by him approved for\r\nEngland, into Ireland, in a parchment roll, for the holding of\r\nparliaments there, which no doubt H. 2. did by advice of his judges,\r\n&c.--This _modus_, &c. was anno 6. H. 4. in the custody of sir\r\nChristopher Preston, which roll H. 4. in the same year, _De assensu\r\nJohannis Talbot Chevalier_, his lieutenant there, and of his council\r\nof Ireland, exemplified, &c.\"\r\n\r\nHere we see the original of a parliament in Ireland, which is\r\nassigned as the cause or reason why Ireland is a distant kingdom\r\nfrom England: and in the same, 4. inst. 349. we find more evidence\r\nthat all this was done at the instance and request of the people in\r\nIreland. Lord Coke says, \"H 2. the father of K. John, did ordain and\r\ncommand, at the instance of the Irish, that such laws as he had in\r\nEngland, should be of force and observed in Ireland. Hereby Ireland,\r\nbeing of itself a distant dominion, and no part of the kingdom of\r\nEngland, (as it directly appeareth by many authorities in Calvin's\r\ncase) was to have parliaments holden there, as England, &c.\" See the\r\nrecord as quoted by lord Coke in the same page, which shews that\r\neven this establishment of English laws, was made _De communi omnium\r\nde Hiberniæ consensu_.\r\n\r\nThis whole chapter is well worth attending to, because the records\r\nquoted in it shew how careful the ancients were to obtain the consent\r\nof the governed to all laws, though a conquered people, and the king\r\nabsolute. Very unlike the minister of our æra, who is for pulling\r\ndown and building up the most sacred establishments of laws and\r\ngovernment, without the least regard to the consent or good will of\r\nAmericans. There is one observation more of lord Coke that deserves\r\nparticular notice. \"Sometimes the king of England called his nobles\r\nof Ireland to come to his parliament of England, &c. and by special\r\nwords the parliament of England may bind the subjects of Ireland,\"\r\nand cites the record 8. E. 2. and subjoins \"an excellent precedent\r\nto be followed, whensoever any act of parliament shall be made in\r\nEngland, concerning the state of Ireland, &c.\" By this lord Coke\r\nseems to intimate an opinion, that representatives had been and ought\r\nto be called from Ireland to the parliament of England, whenever it\r\nundertook to govern it by statutes, in which it should be specially\r\nnamed.\r\n\r\nAfter all, I believe there is no evidence of any express contract of\r\nthe Irish nation to be governed by the English parliament, and very\r\nlittle of an implied one; that the notion of binding it by acts in\r\nwhich it is expressly named is merely arbitrary. And that this nation\r\nwhich has ever had many and great virtues, has been most grievously\r\noppressed: and it is to this day so greatly injured and oppressed,\r\nthat I wonder American committees of correspondence and congresses,\r\nhave not attended more to it than they have. Perhaps in some future\r\ntime they may. But I am running beyond my line.\r\n\r\nWe must now turn to Burrows's reports, vol. 2. 834. Rex. vs. Cowle.\r\nLord Mansfield has many observations upon the case of Wales, which\r\nought not to be overlooked. Page 850, he says, \"Edward 1st. conceived\r\nthe great design of annexing all other parts of the island of Great\r\nBritain to the realm of England. The better to effectuate his idea,\r\nas time should offer occasion; he mentioned, 'that all parts thereof,\r\nnot in his own hands or possession, were holden of his crown.' The\r\nconsequence of this doctrine was, that, by the feudal law, supreme\r\njurisdiction resulted to him, in right of his crown, as sovereign\r\nlord, in many cases, which he might lay hold of; and when the said\r\nterritories should come into his hands and possession, they would\r\ncome back as parcel of the realm of England, from which (by fiction\r\nof law at least) they had been originally severed. This doctrine was\r\nliterally true as to the counties palatine of Chester and Durham. But\r\n(no matter upon what foundation) he maintained that the principality\r\nof Wales was holden of the imperial crown of England: he treated\r\nthe prince of Wales as a rebellious vassal; subdued him; and took\r\npossession of the principality. Whereupon, on the 4th of December, in\r\nthe 9th year of his reign, he issued a commission to enquire '_per\r\nquas leges et per quas consuetudines, antecessores nostri reges regni\r\nconsueverant principam Walliæ et barones Wallenses Walliæ et pares\r\nsuos et alios in priores et eorum pares, &c._' If the principality\r\nwas feudatory, the conclusion necessarily followed, that it was\r\nunder the government of the king's laws, and the king's courts, in\r\ncases proper for them to interpose; though (like counties palatine)\r\nthey had peculiar laws and customs, _jura regalia_, and complete\r\njurisdiction at home.\" There was a writ at the same time issued to\r\nall his officers in Wales, to give information to the commissioners:\r\nand there were 14 interrogatories specifying the points to be\r\nenquired into. The statute of Rutland 12. E. 1. refers to this\r\ninquiry. By that statute he does not annex Wales to England, but\r\nrecites it as a consequence of its coming into his hands. \"_Divina\r\nprovidentia terram Walliæ, prius nobis jure feodali subjectam, jam\r\nin proprietatis nostræ dominium convertit, et coronæ regni Angliæ,\r\ntanquam partem corporis ejusdem annexuit, et univit._\" The 27. H.\r\n8. c. 26. adheres to the same plan, and recites \"that Wales ever\r\nhath been incorporated, annexed, united and subject to, and under\r\nthe imperial crown of this realm, as a very member, and joint of the\r\nsame.\" Edward 1. having succeeded as to Wales, maintained likewise\r\nthat Scotland was holden of the crown of England. This opinion of the\r\ncourt was delivered by lord Mansfield in the year 1759. In conformity\r\nto the _system_ contained in these words, my lord Mansfield, and\r\nmy lord North, together with their little friends Bernard and\r\nHutchinson, have \"conceived the great design of annexing\" all North\r\nAmerica \"to the realm of England,\" and \"the better to effectuate this\r\nidea, they all maintain, that North America is holden of the crown.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, no matter upon what foundation, they all maintained that America\r\nis dependent on the imperial crown and parliament of Great Britain:\r\nand they are all very eagerly desirous of treating the Americans\r\nas rebellious vassals, to subdue them and take possession of their\r\ncountry. And when they do, no doubt America will come back as parcel\r\nof the realm of England, from which, by fiction of law at least, or\r\nby virtual representation, or by some other dream of a shadow of a\r\nshade, they had been originally severed.\r\n\r\nBut these noblemen and ignoblemen ought to have considered,\r\nthat Americans understand the laws and the politicks as well as\r\nthemselves, and that there are 600,000 men in it, between 16 and 60\r\nyears of age; and therefore it will be very difficult to chicane them\r\nout of their liberties by \"fictions of law,\" and \"no matter upon what\r\nfoundation.\"\r\n\r\nMethinks I hear his lordship upon this occasion, in a soliloquy\r\nsomewhat like this. \"We are now in the midst of a war, which has\r\nbeen conducted with unexampled success and glory. We have conquered\r\na great part, and shall soon complete the conquest of the French\r\npower in America. His majesty is near 70 years of age, and must soon\r\nyield to nature. The amiable, virtuous and promising successor,\r\neducated under the care of my nearest friends, will be influenced\r\nby our advice. We must bring the war to a conclusion, for we have\r\nnot the martial spirit and abilities of the great commoner: but we\r\nshall be obliged to leave upon the nation an immense debt. How shall\r\nwe manage that? Why, I have seen letters from America, proposing\r\nthat parliament should bring America to a closer dependence upon it,\r\nand representing that if it does not, she will fall a prey to some\r\nforeign power, or set up for herself. These hints may be improved,\r\nand a vast revenue drawn from that country and the East Indies, or\r\nat least the people here may be flattered and quieted with the hopes\r\nof it. It is the duty of a judge to declare law, but under this\r\npretence, many we know have given law or made law, and none in all\r\nthe records of Westminster hall more than of late. Enough has been\r\nalready made, if it is wisely improved by others, to overturn this\r\nconstitution. Upon this occasion I will accommodate my expressions,\r\nto such a design upon America and Asia, and will so accommodate\r\nboth law and fact, that they may hereafter be improved to admirable\r\neffect in promoting our design.\" This is all romance, no doubt, but\r\nit has as good a moral as most romances. For 1st. It is an utter\r\nmistake that Ed. 1st. conceived the great design of annexing all to\r\nEngland, as one state, under one legislature. He conceived the design\r\nof annexing Wales, &c. to his crown. He did not pretend that it was\r\nbefore subject to the crown, but to him. \"_Nobis jure feodali_\"\r\nare his words. And when he annexes it to his crown, he does it by\r\nan edict of his own, not an act of parliament: and he never did in\r\nhis whole life allow, that his parliament, that is his lords and\r\ncommons, had any authority over it, or that he was obliged to take\r\nor ask their advice, in any one instance, concerning the management\r\nof it, nor did any of his successors for centuries. It was not Ed.\r\n1. but Henry 7. who first conceived the great design of annexing it\r\nto the realm, and by him and H. 8. it was done, in part, but never\r\ncompleted, until Jac. 1. There is a sense indeed, in which annexing\r\na territory to the crown, is annexing it to the realm, as putting a\r\ncrown upon a man's head, is putting it on the man, but it does not\r\nmake it a part of the man. 2d. His lordship mentions the statute of\r\nRutland; but this was not an act of parliament, and therefore could\r\nnot annex Wales to the realm, if the king had intended it, for it\r\nnever was in the power of the king alone to annex a country to the\r\nrealm. This cannot be done, but by act of parliament. As to Edward's\r\ntreating the prince of Wales as a \"rebellious vassal,\" this was\r\narbitrary, and is spoken of by all historians as an infamous piece of\r\ntyranny.\r\n\r\nEd. 1. and H. 8. both considered Wales, as the property and revenue\r\nof the crown, not as a part of the realm, and the expressions,\r\n\"_coronæ regni Angliæ, tanquam partem corporis ejusdem_,\" signified\r\n\"as part of the same body,\" that is of the same \"crown,\" not \"realm\"\r\nor \"kingdom\"; and the expressions in 27 H. 8. under the imperial\r\ncrown of this realm, as a very member \"and joint of the same,\"\r\nmean, as a member and joint of the \"imperial crown,\" not of the\r\nrealm. For the whole history of the principality, the acts of kings,\r\nparliaments, and people shew, that Wales never was intituled by this\r\nannexation to the laws of England, nor bound to obey them. The case\r\nof Ireland is enough to prove that the crown and realm are not the\r\nsame. For Ireland is certainly annexed to the crown of England, and\r\nit certainly is not annexed to the realm.\r\n\r\nThere is one paragraph in the foregoing words of lord Mansfield,\r\nwhich was quoted by his admirer governor Hutchinson in his dispute\r\nwith the house, with a profound compliment. \"He did not know a\r\ngreater authority,\" &c. But let the authority be as great as it will,\r\nthe doctrine will not bear the test.\r\n\r\n\"If the principality was feudatory, the conclusion necessarily\r\nfollows, that it was under the government of the king's laws.\"\r\nIreland is feudatory to the crown of England, but would not be\r\nsubject to the king's English laws, without its consent and compact.\r\nAn estate may be feudatory to a lord, a country may be feudatory to\r\na sovereign lord, upon all possible variety of conditions; it may be\r\nonly to render homage; it may be to render a rent; it may be to pay a\r\ntribute; if his lordship by feudatory means, the original notion of\r\nfeuds, it is true that the king the general imperator, was absolute,\r\nand the tenant held his estate only at will, and the subject not\r\nonly his estate but his person and life at his will. But this notion\r\nof feuds had been relaxed in an infinite variety of degrees, in\r\nsome the estate is held at will, in others for life, in others for\r\nyears, in others forever, to heirs, &c. in some to be governed by the\r\nprince alone, in some by princes and nobles, and in some by prince,\r\nnobles and commons, &c. So that being feudatory, by no means proves\r\nthat English lords and commons have any share in the government\r\nover us. As to counties palatine; these were not only holden of the\r\nking and crown, but were exerted by express acts of parliament, and\r\ntherefore were never exempted from the authority of parliament. The\r\nsame parliament, which erected the county palatine, and gave it its\r\n_jura regalia_, and compleat jurisdiction, might unmake it, and take\r\naway those regalia and jurisdiction. But American governments and\r\nconstitutions were never erected by parliament, their _regalia_ and\r\njurisdiction were not given by parliament, and therefore parliament\r\nhave no authority to take them away.\r\n\r\nBut if the colonies are feudatory to the kings of England, and\r\nsubject to the government of the king's laws, it is only to such\r\nlaws as are made in their general assemblies, their provincial\r\nlegislatures.\r\n\r\nNOVANGLUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESSED\r\n\r\n_To the Inhabitants of the Colony of Massachusetts Bay_,\r\n\r\nApril 17, 1775.\r\n\r\n\r\nMY FRIENDS,\r\n\r\nWe now come to Jersey and Guernsey, which Massachusettensis says,\r\n\"are no part of the realm of England, nor are they represented in\r\nparliament, but are subject to its authority.\" A little knowledge\r\nof this subject will do us no harm; and as soon as we shall acquire\r\nit, we shall be satisfied how these islands came to be subject to\r\nthe authority of parliament. It is either upon the principle that\r\nthe king is absolute there, and has a right to make laws for them\r\nby his mere will; and therefore may express his will by an act of\r\nparliament, or an edict at his pleasure: or it is an usurpation. If\r\nit is an usurpation, it ought not to be a precedent for the colonies,\r\nbut it ought to be reformed, and they ought to be incorporated into\r\nthe realm, by act of parliament, and their own act. Their situation\r\nis no objection to this. Ours is an insurmountable obstacle.\r\n\r\nThus we see that in every instance which can be found, the\r\nobservation proves to be true, that by the common law, the laws of\r\nEngland, and the authority of parliament, and the limits of the\r\nrealm were confined within seas. That the kings of England had\r\nfrequently foreign dominions, some by conquest, some by marriage,\r\nand some by descent. But in all those cases the kings were either\r\nabsolute in those dominions, or bound to govern them according to\r\ntheir own respective laws, and by their own legislative and executive\r\ncouncils. That the laws of England did not extend there, and the\r\nEnglish parliament pretended no jurisdiction there, nor claimed any\r\nright to controul the king in his government of those dominions. And\r\nfrom this extensive survey of all the foregoing cases, there results\r\na confirmation of what has been so often said, that there is no\r\nprovision in the common law, in English precedents, in the English\r\ngovernment or constitution, made for the case of the colonies. It is\r\nnot a conquered, but a discovered country. It came not to the king by\r\ndescent, but was explored by the settlers. It came not by marriage to\r\nthe king, but was purchased by the settlers of the savages. It was\r\nnot granted by the king of his grace, but was dearly, very dearly\r\nearned by the planters, in the labour, blood, and treasure which they\r\nexpended to subdue it to cultivation. It stands upon no grounds,\r\nthen, of law or policy, but what are found in the law of nature,\r\nand their express contracts in their charters, and their implied\r\ncontracts in the commissions to governors and terms of settlement.\r\n\r\nThe cases of Chester and Durham, counties palantine within the realm,\r\nshall conclude this fatiguing ramble. Chester was an earldom and a\r\ncounty; and in the 21st year of king Richard 2d. A. D. 1397, it was,\r\nby an act of parliament, erected into a principality, and several\r\ncastles and towns, were annexed to it, saving to the king the rights\r\nof his crown. This was a county palatine, and had _jura regalia_,\r\nbefore this erection of it into a principality. But the statute which\r\nmade it a principality, was again repealed by 1. Henry 4th. c. 3, and\r\nin 1399, by the 1. Henry 4th. c. 18. Grievous complaints were made\r\nto the king, in parliament, of murders, man-slaughters, robberies,\r\nbatteries, riots, &c. done by people of the county of Chester, in\r\ndivers counties of England. For remedy of which it is enacted, that\r\nif any person of the county of Chester commit any murder or felony\r\nin any place out of that county, process shall be made against him\r\nby the common law, till the exigent in the county where such murder\r\nor felony was done: and if he flee into the county of Chester, and\r\nbe outlawed, and put in exigent for such murder or felony, the\r\nsame outlawry or exigent, shall be certified to the officers and\r\nministers of the same county of Chester, and the felon shall be\r\ntaken, his lands and goods within that county shall be seized as\r\nforfeit into the hands of the prince, or of him that shall be lord\r\nof the same county of Chester, and the king shall have the year and\r\nday and waste; and the other lands and goods of such felons, out of\r\nsaid county, shall remain wholly to the king, &c. as forfeit. And a\r\nsimilar provision in case of battery or trespass, &c.\r\n\r\nConsidering the great seal of England, and the process of the king's\r\ncontracts did not run into Chester, it was natural that malefactors\r\nshould take refuge there, and escape punishment, and therefore a\r\nstatute like this was of indispensible necessity, and afterwards,\r\nin 1535, another statute was made, 27. Henry c. 5th. for the making\r\nof justices of peace, within Chester, &c. It recites, \"the king,\r\nconsidering the manifold robberies, murders, thefts, trespasses,\r\nriots, routs, embraceries, maintenances, oppressions, ruptures\r\nof his peace, &c. which have been daily done within his county\r\npalatine of Chester, &c. by reason that common justice hath not been\r\nindifferently ministered there, like and in form as it is in other\r\nplaces of this his realm, by reason whereof the said criminals have\r\nremained unpunished; for redress whereof, and to the intent that\r\none order of law should be had, the king is empowered to constitute\r\njustices of peace, quorum, and goal delivery, in Chester, &c.\"\r\n\r\nBy the 32. Henry 8th. c. 43, another act was made concerning the\r\ncounty palatine of Chester, for shire days.\r\n\r\nThese three acts soon excited discontent in Chester. They had\r\nenjoyed an exemption from the king's English courts, legislative\r\nand executive, and they had no representatives in the English\r\nparliament, and therefore they thought it a violation of their\r\nrights, to be subjected even to those three statutes, as reasonable\r\nand absolutely necessary as they appear to have been. And accordingly\r\nwe find in 1542--34 and 35, Henry 8th. c. 13, a zealous petition\r\nto be represented in parliament, and an act was made for making of\r\nknights and burgesses within the county and city of Chester. It\r\nrecites a part of the petition to the king from the inhabitants\r\nof Chester, stating, \"that the county palatine, had been excluded\r\nfrom parliament, to have any knights and burgesses there; by reason\r\nwhereof, the said inhabitants have hitherto sustained manifold\r\ndisherisons, losses, and damages, in lands, goods, and bodies, as\r\nwell as in the goods civil and politic governance and maintenance\r\nof the commonwealth of their said county: and forasmuch as the\r\nsaid inhabitants have always hitherto been bound by the acts and\r\nstatutes, made by your highness and progenitors in said court,\r\nmeaning, when expressly named, not otherwise, as far forth as other\r\ncounties, cities, and boroughs, which have had knights and burgesses,\r\nand yet have had neither knight, nor burgess there, for the said\r\ncounty palatine; the said inhabitants, for lack thereof, have been\r\noftentimes touched and grieved with acts and statutes, made within\r\nsaid court, as well derogatory unto the most ancient jurisdictions,\r\nliberties, and privileges of your said county palatine, as\r\nprejudicial unto the common weal, quietness, rest and peace of your\r\nsubjects, &c.\" For remedy whereof, two knights of the shire, and two\r\nburgesses for the city are established.\r\n\r\nI have before recited all the acts of parliament, which were ever\r\nmade to meddle with Chester, except the 51. Henry 3d. stat. 5, in\r\n1266, which only provides that the justices of Chester, and other\r\nbailiffs, shall be answerable in the exchequer, for wards, escheats,\r\nand other bailiwicks; yet Chester was never severed from the crown\r\nor realm of England, nor ever expressly exempted from the authority\r\nof parliament; yet as they had generally enjoyed an exemption from\r\nthe exercise of the authority of parliament, we see how soon they\r\ncomplain of it as grievous, and claim a representation, as a right;\r\nand we see how readily it was granted. America, on the contrary, is\r\nnot in the realm, never was subject to the authority of parliament,\r\nby any principle of law, is so far from Great Britain, that she never\r\ncan be represented; yet she is to be bound in all cases whatsoever.\r\n\r\nThe first statute, which appears in which Durham is named, is\r\n27 Henry 8th. c. 24, § 21. Cuthbert, bishop of Durham, and his\r\nsuccessors, and their temporal chancellor of the county palatine of\r\nDurham, are made justices of the peace. The next is 31 Elizabeth, c.\r\n9, recites, that Durham is, and of long time hath been, an ancient\r\ncounty palatine, in which the Queen's writ hath not, and yet doth not\r\nrun; enacts that a writ of proclamation upon an exigent against any\r\nperson dwelling in the bishoprick shall run there for the future. And\r\n§ 5 confirms all the other liberties of the bishop and his officers.\r\n\r\nAnd after this, we find no other mention of that bishoprick in any\r\nstatute until 25 Char. 2. c. 9. This statute recites \"whereas the\r\ninhabitants of the county palatine of Durham, have not hitherto had\r\nthe liberty and privilege of electing and sending any knights and\r\nburgesses to the high court of parliament, although the inhabitants\r\nof the said county palatine are liable to all payments, rates, and\r\nsubsidies, granted by parliament, equally with the inhabitants of\r\nother counties, cities, and burroughs, in this kingdom, who have\r\ntheir knights and burgesses in the parliament, and are therefore\r\nconcerned equally with others, the inhabitants of this kingdom, to\r\nhave knights and burgesses in the said high court of parliament of\r\ntheir own election, to represent the condition of their county,\r\nas the inhabitants of other counties, cities, and burroughs, of\r\nthis kingdom have.\" It enacts two knights for the county, and two\r\nburgesses for the city. Here it should be observed, that although\r\nthey acknowledge that they had been liable to all rates, &c. granted\r\nby parliament, yet none had actually been laid upon them before this\r\nstatute.\r\n\r\nMassachusettensis then comes to the first charter of this province,\r\nand he tells us, that in it \"we shall find irresistible evidence,\r\nthat our being a part of the empire, subject to the supreme authority\r\nof the state, bound by its laws, and subject to its protection, was\r\nthe very terms and conditions by which our ancestors held their\r\nlands and settled the province.\" This is roundly and warmly said:\r\nbut there is more zeal in it than knowledge. As to our being part\r\nof the empire, it could not be the British empire, as it is called,\r\nbecause that was not then in being, but was created seventy or\r\neighty years afterwards. It must be the English empire then, but\r\nthe nation was not then polite enough to have introduced into the\r\nlanguage of the law, or common parlance any such phrase or idea.\r\nRome never introduced the terms Roman empire until the tragedy of\r\nher freedom was compleated. Before that, it was only the republic,\r\nor the city. In the same manner the realm or the kingdom, or the\r\ndominions of the king, were the fashionable style in the age of the\r\nfirst charter. As to being subject to the supreme authority of the\r\nstate, the prince who granted that charter thought it resided in\r\nhimself, without any such troublesome tumults as lords and commons;\r\nand before the granting that charter, had dissolved his parliament,\r\nand determined never to call another, but to govern without. It\r\nis not very likely then, that he intended our ancestors should be\r\ngoverned by parliament, or bound by its laws. As to being subject to\r\nits protection, we may guess what ideas king and parliament had of\r\nthat, by the protection they actually afforded to our ancestors. Not\r\none farthing was ever voted or given by the king or his parliament,\r\nor any one resolution taken about them. As to holding their lands,\r\nsurely they did not hold their lands of lords and commons. If they\r\nagreed to hold their lands of the king, this did not subject them to\r\nEnglish lords and commons, any more than the inhabitants of Scotland\r\nholding their lands of the same king, subjected them. But there is\r\nnot a word about the empire, the supreme authority of the state,\r\nbeing bound by its laws, or obliged for its protection in that whole\r\ncharter. But \"our charter is in the royal style.\" What then? Is that\r\nthe parliamentary style? The style is this, \"Charles, by the grace\r\nof God, king of England, Scotland, France and Ireland, defender of\r\nthe faith, &c.\"--Now in which capacity did he grant that charter?\r\nas king of France, or Ireland, or Scotland, or England? He governed\r\nEngland by one parliament, Scotland by another. Which parliament were\r\nwe to be governed by? And Ireland by a third; and it might as well\r\nbe reasoned that America was to be governed by the Irish parliament,\r\nas by the English. But it was granted \"under the great seal of\r\nEngland\"--true. But this seal runneth not out of the realm, except\r\nto mandatory writs; and when our charter was given, it was never\r\nintended to go out of the realm. The charter and the corporation were\r\nintended to abide and remain within the realm, and be like other\r\ncorporations there. But this affair of the seal is a mere piece of\r\nimposition.\r\n\r\nIn Moore's reports in the case of the union of the realm of Scotland\r\nwith England, it is resolved by the judges that \"the seal is\r\nalterable by the king at his pleasure, and he might make one seal\r\nfor both kingdoms (of England and Scotland) for seals, coin, and\r\nleagues are of absolute prerogative to the king, without parliament,\r\nnor restrained to any assent of the people;\" and in determining\r\nhow far the great seal doth command out of England, they made\r\nthis distinction. \"That the great seal was current for remedials,\r\nwhich groweth on complaint of the subject, and thereupon writs are\r\naddressed under the great seal of England, which writs are limited,\r\ntheir precinct to be within the places of the jurisdiction of the\r\ncourt, that was to give the redress of the wrong. And therefore\r\nwrits are not to go into Ireland, or the isles, nor Wales, nor the\r\ncounties palatine, because the king's courts here have not power to\r\nhold pleas of lands or things there. But the great seal hath a power\r\npreceptory to the person, which power extendeth to any place, where\r\nthe person may be found, &c.\" This authority plainly shews, that the\r\ngreat seal of England has no more authority out of the realm, except\r\nto mandatory or preceptory writs, and surely the first charter was no\r\npreceptory writ, than the privy seal, or the great seal of Scotland,\r\nor no seal at all. In truth, the seal and charter were intended to\r\nremain within the realm, and be of force to a corporation there; but\r\nthe moment it was transferred to New England, it lost all its legal\r\nforce, by the common law of England; and as this translation of it\r\nwas acquiesced in by all parties, it might well be considered as good\r\nevidence of a contract between the parties, and in no other light;\r\nbut not a whit the better or stronger for being under the great seal\r\nof England. But, \"the grants are made by the king for his heirs and\r\nsuccessors.\" What then? So the Scots held their lands of him, who was\r\nthen king of England, his heirs and successors, and were bound to\r\nallegiance to him, his heirs and successors, but it did not follow\r\nfrom thence that the Scots were subject to the English parliament. So\r\nthe inhabitants of Aquitain, for ten descents, held their lands, and\r\nwere tied by allegiance to him who was king of England, his heirs and\r\nsuccessors, but were under no subjection to English lords and commons.\r\n\r\nHeirs and successors of the king, are supposed to be the same\r\npersons, and are used as synonymous words in the English law. There\r\nis no positive artificial provision made by our laws, or the British\r\nconstitution for revolutions. All our positive laws suppose that the\r\nroyal office will descend to the eldest branch of the male line, or\r\nin default of that, to the eldest female, &c. forever, and that the\r\nsuccession will not be broken. It is true, that nature, necessity,\r\nand the great principles of self-preservation, have often over-ruled\r\nthe succession. But this was done without any positive instruction\r\nof law. Therefore, the grants being by the king, for his heirs\r\nand successors, and the tenures being of the king, his heirs and\r\nsuccessors, and the preservation being to the king, his heirs, and\r\nsuccessors, are so far from proving that we were to be part of an\r\nempire, as one state, subject to the supreme authority of the English\r\nor British state, and subject to its protection, that they do not so\r\nmuch as prove that we are annexed to the English crown. And all the\r\nsubtility of the writers on the side of the ministry, has never yet\r\nproved, that America is so much as annexed to the crown, much less\r\nto the realm. \"It is apparent the king acted in his royal capacity,\r\nas king of England.\" This I deny. The laws of England gave him no\r\nauthority to grant any territory out of the realm. Besides, there is\r\nno colour for his thinking that he acted in that capacity, but his\r\nusing the great seal of England: but if the king is absolute in the\r\naffair of the seal, and may make or use any seal that he pleases,\r\nhis using that seal which had been commonly used in England, is no\r\ncertain proof that he acted as king of England; for it is plain, he\r\nmight have used the English seal in the government of Scotland, and\r\nin that case it will not be pretended that he would have acted in\r\nhis royal capacity, as king of England. But his acting as king of\r\nEngland, \"necessarily supposes the territory granted to be a part\r\nof the English dominions, and holden of the crown of England.\" Here\r\nis the word \"dominions,\" systematically introduced instead of the\r\nword \"realm.\" There was no English dominions, but the realm. And I\r\nsay that America was not any part of the English realm or dominions.\r\nAnd therefore, when the king granted it, he could not act as king of\r\nEngland, by the laws of England. As to the \"territory being holden of\r\nthe crown, there is no such thing in nature or art.\" Lands are holden\r\naccording to the original notices of feuds of the natural person of\r\nthe lord. Holding lands, in feudal language, means no more than the\r\nrelation between lord and tenant. The reciprocal duties of these\r\nare all personal. Homage, fealty, &c. and all other services, are\r\npersonal to the lord; protection, &c. is personal to the tenant. And\r\ntherefore no homage, fealty, or other services, can ever be rendered\r\nto the body politic, the political capacity, which is not corporated,\r\nbut only a frame in the mind, an idea. No lands here, or in England,\r\nare held of the crown, meaning by it, the political capacity; they\r\nare all held of the royal person, the natural person of the king.\r\nHolding lands, &c. of the crown, is an impropriety of expression,\r\nbut it is often used, and when it is, it can have no other sensible\r\nmeaning than this: that we hold lands of that person, whoever he is,\r\nwho wears the crown; the law supposes he will be a right, natural\r\nheir of the present king forever.\r\n\r\nMassachusettensis then produces a quotation from the first charter,\r\nto prove several points. It is needless to repeat the whole, but\r\nthe parts chiefly relied on, are italicised. It makes the company\r\na body politic in fact and name, &c. and enables it \"to sue and be\r\nsued.\" Then the writer asks, \"whether this looks like a distinct\r\nstate, or independent empire?\" I answer no. And that it is plain and\r\nuncontroverted, that the first charter was intended only to erect\r\na corporation within the realm, and the governor and company were\r\nto reside within the realm, and their general courts were to be\r\nheld there. Their agents, deputies, and servants only were to come\r\nto America. And if this had taken place, nobody ever doubted but\r\nthey would have been subject to parliament. But this intention was\r\nnot regarded on either side, and the company came over to America,\r\nand brought their charter with them. And as soon as they arrived\r\nhere, they got out of the English realm, dominions, state, empire,\r\ncall it by what name you will, and out of the legal jurisdiction\r\nof parliament. The king might, by his writ or proclamation, have\r\ncommanded them to return; but he did not.\r\n\r\nNOVANGLUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n     NOTE.\r\n\r\n     Hostilities, at Lexington, between Great Britain and her\r\n     colonies, commenced on the nineteenth of April, two days\r\n     succeeding the publication of this last essay. Several\r\n     others were written, and sent to the printers of the\r\n     _Boston Gazette_, which were probably lost, amidst the\r\n     confusion occasioned by that event.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMASSACHUSETTENSIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESSED\r\n\r\n_To the Inhabitants of the Province of Massachusetts Bay_,\r\n\r\nDecember 12, 1774.\r\n\r\n\r\nMY DEAR COUNTRYMEN,\r\n\r\nWhen a people, by what means soever, are reduced to such a situation,\r\nthat every thing they hold dear, as men and citizens, is at stake,\r\nit is not only excuseable, but even praiseworthy for an individual\r\nto offer to the public any thing, that he may think has a tendency\r\nto ward off the impending danger; nor should he be restrained from\r\nan apprehension that what he may offer will be unpopular, any more\r\nthan a physician should be restrained from prescribing a salutary\r\nmedicine, through fear it might be unpalatable to his patient.\r\n\r\nThe press, when open to all parties and influenced by none, is\r\na salutary engine in a free state, perhaps a necessary one to\r\npreserve the freedom of that state; but, when a party has gained the\r\nascendancy so far as to become the licensers of the press, either\r\nby an act of government, or by playing off the resentment of the\r\npopulace against printers and authors, the press itself becomes an\r\nengine of oppression or licentiousness, and is as pernicious to\r\nsociety, as otherwise it would be beneficial. It is too true to be\r\ndenied, that ever since the origin of our controversy with Great\r\nBritain, the press, in this town, has been much devoted to the\r\npartizans of liberty; they have been indulged in publishing what they\r\npleased, _fas vel nefas_, while little has been published on the part\r\nof government. The effect this must have had upon the minds of the\r\npeople in general is obvious; they must have formed their opinion\r\nupon a partial view of the subject, and of course it must have been\r\nin some degree erroneous. In short, the changes have been rung so\r\noften upon oppression, tyranny and slavery, that, whether sleeping or\r\nwaking, they are continually vibrating in our ears; and it is now\r\nhigh time to ask ourselves, whether we have not been deluded by sound\r\nonly.\r\n\r\nMy dear countrymen, let us divest ourselves of prejudice, take a view\r\nof our present wretched situation, contrast it with our former happy\r\none, carefully investigate the cause, and industriously seek some\r\nmeans to escape the evils we now feel, and prevent those that we have\r\nreason to expect.\r\n\r\nWe have been so long advancing to our present state, and by such\r\ngradations, that perhaps many of us are insensible of our true state\r\nand real danger. Should you be told that acts of high treason are\r\nflagrant through the country, that a great part of the province is\r\nin actual rebellion, would you believe it true? Should you not deem\r\nthe person asserting it, an enemy to the province? Nay, should you\r\nnot spurn him from you with indignation? Be calm, my friends; it is\r\nnecessary to know the worst of a disease, to enable us to provide an\r\neffectual remedy. Are not the bands of society cut asunder, and the\r\nsanctions that hold man to man, trampled upon? Can any of us recover\r\na debt, or obtain compensation for an injury, by law? Are not many\r\npersons, whom once we respected and revered, driven from their homes\r\nand families, and forced to fly to the army for protection, for no\r\nother reason but their having accepted commissions under our king?\r\nIs not civil government dissolved? Some have been made to believe\r\nthat nothing short of attempting the life of the king, or fighting\r\nhis troops, can amount to high treason or rebellion. If, reader, you\r\nare one of those, apply to an honest lawyer, (if such an one can be\r\nfound) and enquire what kind of offence it is for a number of men to\r\nassemble armed, and forcibly to obstruct the course of justice, even\r\nto prevent the king's courts from being held at their stated terms;\r\nfor a body of people to seize upon the king's provincial revenue; I\r\nmean the monies collected by virtue of grants made by the general\r\ncourt to his majesty for the support of his government, within this\r\nprovince; for a body of men to assemble without being called by\r\nauthority, and to pass governmental acts; or for a number of people\r\nto take the militia out of the hands of the king's representative,\r\nor to form a new militia, or to raise men and appoint officers for a\r\npublic purpose, without the order or permission of the king, or his\r\nrepresentative; or for a number of men to take to their arms, and\r\nmarch with a professed design of opposing the king's troops; ask,\r\nreader, of such a lawyer, what is the crime, and what the punishment;\r\nand if, perchance, thou art one that hast been active in these\r\nthings, and art not insensibility itself, his answer will harrow up\r\nthy soul.\r\n\r\nI assure you, my friends, I would not that this conduct should\r\nbe told beyond the borders of this province; I wish it were\r\nconsigned to perpetual oblivion; but alas, it is too notorious to\r\nbe concealed; our news-papers have already published it to the\r\nworld; we can neither prevent nor conceal it. The shaft is already\r\nsped, and the utmost exertion is necessary to prevent the blow. We\r\nalready feel the effects of anarchy; mutual confidence, affection,\r\nand tranquility, those sweetners of human life, are succeeded by\r\ndistrust, hatred, and wild uproar; the useful arts of agriculture\r\nand commerce are neglected for caballing, mobbing this or the other\r\nman, because he acts, speaks, or is suspected of thinking different\r\nfrom the prevailing sentiment of the times, in purchasing arms, and\r\nforming a militia; O height of madness! with a professed design\r\nof opposing Great Britain. I suspect many of us have been induced\r\nto join in these measures, or but faintly to oppose them, from an\r\napprehension that Great Britain would not, or could not exert herself\r\nsufficiently to subdue America. Let us consider this matter. However\r\nclosely we may hug ourselves in the opinion, that the parliament has\r\nno right to tax or legislate for us, the people of England hold the\r\ncontrary opinion as firmly. They tell us we are a part of the British\r\nempire; that every state, from the nature of government, must have a\r\nsupreme, uncontrolable power, co-extensive with the empire itself;\r\nand that that power is vested in parliament. It is as unpopular to\r\ndeny this doctrine in Great Britain, as it is to assert it in the\r\ncolonies; so there is but little probability of serving ourselves at\r\nthis day by our ingenious distinctions between a right of legislation\r\nfor one purpose, and not for another. We have bid them defiance;\r\nand the longest sword must carry it, unless we change our measures.\r\nMankind are the same, in all parts of the world. The same fondness\r\nfor dominion that presides in the breast of an American, actuates\r\nthe breast of an European. If the colonies are not a part of the\r\nBritish empire already, and subject to the supreme authority of the\r\nstate, Great Britain will make them so. Had we been prudent enough\r\nto confine our opposition within certain limits, we might have stood\r\nsome chance of succeeding once more; but alas, we have passed the\r\nRubicon. It is now universally said and believed, in England, that if\r\nthis opportunity of reclaiming the colonies, and reducing them to a\r\nsense of their duty is lost, they, in truth, will be dismembered from\r\nthe empire, and become as distinct a state from Great Britain, as\r\nHanover; that is, although they may continue their allegiance to the\r\nperson of the king, they will own none to the imperial crown of Great\r\nBritain, nor yield obedience to any of her laws, but such as they\r\nshall think proper to adopt. Can you indulge the thought one moment,\r\nthat Great Britain will consent to this? For what has she protected\r\nand defended the colonies against the maritime powers of Europe, from\r\ntheir first British settlement to this day? For what did she purchase\r\nNew-York of the Dutch? For what was she so lavish of her best blood\r\nand treasure in the conquest of Canada, and other territories in\r\nAmerica? Was it to raise up a rival state, or to enlarge her own\r\nempire? Or if the consideration of empire was out of the question,\r\nwhat security can she have of our trade, when once she has lost our\r\nobedience? I mention these things, my friends, that you may know how\r\npeople reason upon the subject in England, and to convince you that\r\nyou are much deceived, if you imagine that Great Britain will accede\r\nto the claims of the colonies, she will as soon conquer New-England\r\nas Ireland or Canada, if either of them revolted; and by arms, if the\r\nmilder influences of government prove ineffectual. Perhaps you are as\r\nfatally mistaken in another respect. I mean, as to the power of Great\r\nBritain to conquer. But can any of you, that think soberly upon the\r\nmatter, be so deluded as to believe that Great Britain, who so lately\r\ncarried her arms with success to every part of the globe, triumphed\r\nover the united powers of France and Spain, and whose fleets give\r\nlaw to the ocean, is unable to conquer us? Should the colonies\r\nunite in a war against Great Britain (which by the way is not a\r\nsupposable case) the colonies south of Pennsylvania would be unable\r\nto furnish any men; they have not more than is necessary to govern\r\ntheir numerous slaves, and to defend themselves against the Indians.\r\nI will suppose that the northern colonies can furnish as many, and\r\nindeed more men than can be used to advantage; but have you arms fit\r\nfor a campaign? If you have arms, have you military stores, or can\r\nyou procure them? When this war is proclaimed, all supplies from\r\nforeign parts will be cut off. Have you money to maintain the war? Or\r\nhad you all those things, some others are still wanting, which are\r\nabsolutely necessary to encounter regular troops, that is discipline,\r\nand that subordination, whereby each can command all below him, from\r\na general officer to the lowest subaltern; these you neither have\r\nnor can have in such a war. It is well known that the provincials\r\nin the late war were never brought to a proper discipline, though\r\nthey had the example of the regular troops to encourage, and the\r\nmartial law to enforce it. We all know, notwithstanding the province\r\nlaw for regulating the militia, it was under little more command\r\nthan what the officers could obtain from treating and humouring the\r\ncommon soldiers; what, then, can be expected from such an army as you\r\nwill bring into the field, if you bring any, each one a politician,\r\npuffed up with his own opinion, and feeling himself second to none?\r\nCan any of you command ten thousand such men? Can you punish the\r\ndisobedient? Can all your wisdom direct their strength, courage or\r\nactivity to any given point? Would not the least disappointment or\r\nunfavourable aspect cause a general dereliction of the service? Your\r\nnew-fangled militia have already given us a _specimen_ of their\r\nfuture conduct. In some of their companies, they have already chosen\r\ntwo, in others, three sets of officers, and are as dissatisfied with\r\nthe last choice as the first. I do not doubt the natural bravery of\r\nmy countrymen; all men would act the same part in the same situation.\r\nSuch is the army with which you are to oppose the most powerful\r\nnation upon the globe. An experienced officer would rather take his\r\nchance with five thousand British troops, than with fifty thousand\r\nsuch militia. I have hitherto confined my observations to the war\r\nwithin the interior parts of the colonies, let us now turn our eyes\r\nto our extensive sea coast, and that we find wholly at the mercy of\r\nGreat Britain; our trade, fishery, navigation, and maritime towns\r\ntaken from us the very day that war is proclaimed. Inconceivably\r\nshocking the scene; if we turn our views to the wilderness, our back\r\nsettlements a prey to our ancient enemy, the Canadians, whose wounds\r\nreceived from us in the late war, will bleed afresh at the prospect\r\nof revenge, and to the numerous tribes of savages, whose tender\r\nmercies are cruelties. Thus with the British navy in the front,\r\nCanadians and savages in the rear, a regular army in the midst, we\r\nmust be certain that whenever the sword of civil war is unsheathed,\r\ndevastation will pass through our land like a whirlwind; our houses\r\nbe burnt to ashes; our fair possessions laid waste, and he that falls\r\nby the sword, will be happy in escaping a more ignominious death.\r\n\r\nI have hitherto gone upon a supposition, that all the colonies, from\r\nNova-Scotia to Georgia, would unite in the war against Great Britain;\r\nbut I believe, if we consider coolly upon the matter, we shall find\r\nno reason to expect any assistance out of New-England; if so, there\r\nwill be no arm stretched out to save us. New England, or perhaps this\r\nself-devoted province will fall alone the unpitied victim of its own\r\nfolly, and furnish the world with one more instance of the fatal\r\nconsequences of rebellion.\r\n\r\nI have as yet said nothing of the difference in sentiment among\r\nourselves. Upon a superficial view we might imagine that this\r\nprovince was nearly unanimous; but the case is far different. A\r\nvery considerable part of the men of property in this province,\r\nare at this day firmly attached to the cause of government; bodies\r\nof men, compelling persons to disavow their sentiments, to resign\r\ncommissions, or to subscribe leagues and covenants, has wrought no\r\nchange in their sentiments; it has only attached them more closely\r\nto government, and caused them to wish more fervently, and to pray\r\nmore devoutly, for its restoration. These, and thousands beside, if\r\nthey fight at all, will fight under the banners of loyalty. I can\r\nassure you that associations are now forming in several parts of this\r\nprovince, for the support of his majesty's government and mutual\r\ndefence; and let me tell you, whenever the royal standard shall be\r\nset up, there will be such a flocking to it, as will astonish the\r\nmost obdurate. And now, in God's name, what is it that has brought\r\nus to this brink of destruction? Has not the government of Great\r\nBritain been as mild and equitable in the colonies, as in any part\r\nof her extensive dominions? Has not she been a nursing mother to us,\r\nfrom the days of our infancy to this time? Has she not been indulgent\r\nalmost to a fault? Might not each one of us at this day have sat\r\nquietly under his own vine and fig-tree, and there have been none to\r\nmake us afraid, were it not for our own folly? Will not posterity\r\nbe amazed, when they are told that the present distraction took its\r\nrise from a three penny duty on tea, and call it a more unaccountable\r\nfrenzy, and more disgraceful to the annals of America, than that of\r\nthe witchcraft?\r\n\r\nI will attempt in the next paper to retrace the steps and mark the\r\nprogressions that led us to this state. I promise to do it with\r\nfidelity; and if any thing should look like reflecting on individuals\r\nor bodies of men, it must be set down to my impartiality, and not to\r\na fondness for censuring.\r\n\r\nMASSACHUSETTENSIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESSED\r\n\r\n_To the Inhabitants of the Province of Massachusetts Bay_,\r\n\r\nDecember 19, 1774.\r\n\r\n\r\nMY DEAR COUNTRYMEN,\r\n\r\nI endeavoured last week to convince you of our real danger, not to\r\nrender you desperate, but to induce you to seek immediately some\r\neffectual remedy. Our case is not yet remediless, as we have to deal\r\nwith a nation not less generous and humane, than powerful and brave;\r\njust indeed, but not vindictive.\r\n\r\nI shall, in this and successive papers, trace this yet growing\r\ndistemper through its several stages, from the first rise to the\r\npresent hour, point out the causes, mark the effects, shew the\r\nmadness of persevering in our present line of conduct, and recommend\r\nwhat, I have been long convinced, is our only remedy. I confess\r\nmyself to be one of those, that think our present calamity is in a\r\ngreat measure to be attributed to the bad policy of a popular party\r\nin this province; and that their measures for several years past,\r\nwhatever may have been their intention, have been diametrically\r\nopposite to their profession,--the public good; and cannot, at\r\npresent, but compare their leaders to a false guide, that having led\r\na benighted traveller through many mazes and windings in a thick\r\nwood, finds himself at length on the brink of a horrid precipice,\r\nand, to save himself, seizes fast hold of his follower, to the utmost\r\nhazard of plunging both headlong down the steep, and being dashed in\r\npieces together against the rocks below.\r\n\r\nIn ordinary cases we may talk in the measured language of a courtier;\r\nbut when such a weight of vengeance is suspended over our heads, by\r\na single thread, as threatens every moment to crush us to atoms,\r\ndelicacy itself would be ill-timed. I will declare the plain truth\r\nwherever I find it, and claim it as a right to canvass popular\r\nmeasures and expose their errors and pernicious tendency, as freely\r\nas governmental measures are canvassed, so long as I confine myself\r\nwithin the limits of the law.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of the late war, Great Britain found that though\r\nshe had humbled her enemies, and greatly enlarged her own empire,\r\nthat the national debt amounted to almost one hundred and fifty\r\nmillions, and that the annual expence of keeping her extended\r\ndominions in a state of defence, which good policy dictates no less\r\nin a time of peace than war, was increased in proportion to the new\r\nacquisitions. Heavy taxes and duties were already laid, not only\r\nupon the luxuries and conveniences, but even the necessaries of life\r\nin Great Britain and Ireland. She knew that the colonies were as\r\nmuch benefitted by the conquests in the late war, as any part of the\r\nempire, and indeed more so, as their continental foes were subdued,\r\nand they might now extend their settlements not only to Canada,\r\nbut even to the western ocean.--The greatest opening was given to\r\nagriculture, the natural livelihood of the country, that ever was\r\nknown in the history of the world, and their trade was protected by\r\nthe British navy. The revenue to the crown, from America, amounted\r\nto but little more than the charges of collecting it. She thought it\r\nas reasonable that the colonies should bear a part of the national\r\nburden, as that they should share in the national benefit. For this\r\npurpose the stamp-act was passed. The colonies soon found that the\r\nduties imposed by the stamp-act would be grievous, as they were laid\r\nupon custom-house papers, law proceedings, conveyancing, and indeed\r\nextended to almost all their internal trade and dealings. It was\r\ngenerally believed through the colonies, that this was a tax not\r\nonly exceeding our proportion, but beyond our utmost ability to pay.\r\nThis idea, united the colonies generally in opposing it. At first we\r\ndid not dream of denying the _authority_ of parliament to tax us,\r\nmuch less to legislate for us. We had always considered ourselves,\r\nas a part of the British empire, and the parliament, as the supreme\r\nlegislature of the whole. Acts of parliament for regulating our\r\ninternal polity were familiar. We had paid postage agreeable to\r\nact of parliament, for establishing a post-office, duties imposed\r\nfor regulating trade, and even for raising a revenue to the crown\r\nwithout questioning the right, though we closely adverted to the\r\nrate or quantum. We knew that in all those acts of government, the\r\ngood of the whole had been consulted, and whenever through want of\r\ninformation any thing grievous had been ordained, we were sure of\r\nobtaining redress by a proper representation of it. We were happy\r\nin our subordination; but in an evil hour, under the influence\r\nof some malignant planet, the design was formed of opposing the\r\nstamp-act, by a denial of the right of parliament to make it. The\r\nlove of empire is so predominant in the human breast, that we rarely\r\nfind an individual content with relinquishing a power that he is\r\nable to retain; never a body of men. Some few months after it was\r\nknown that the stamp-act was passed, some resolves of the house of\r\nburgesses in Virginia, denying the right of parliament to tax the\r\ncolonies, made their appearance. We read them with wonder; they\r\nsavoured of independence; they flattered the human passions; the\r\nreasoning was specious; we wished it conclusive. The transition, to\r\nbelieving it so, was easy; and we, and almost all America, followed\r\ntheir example, in resolving that the parliament had no such right.\r\nIt now became unpopular to suggest the contrary; his life would be\r\nin danger that asserted it. The newspapers were open to but one side\r\nof the question, and the inflammatory pieces that issued weekly\r\nfrom the press, worked up the populace to a fit temper to commit\r\nthe outrages that ensued. A non-importation was agreed upon, which\r\nalarmed the merchants and manufacturers in England. It was novel,\r\nand the people in England then supposed, that the love of liberty\r\nwas so powerful in an American merchant, as to stifle his love of\r\ngain, and that the agreement would be religiously adhered to. It\r\nhas been said, that several thousands were expended in England, to\r\nfoment the disturbances there. However that may be, opposition to\r\nthe ministry was then gaining ground, from circumstances, foreign\r\nto this. The ministry was changed, and the stamp-act repealed. The\r\nrepealing statute passed, with difficulty however, through the\r\nhouse of peers, near forty noble lords protested against giving\r\nway to such an opposition, and foretold what has since literally\r\ncome to pass in consequence of it. When the statute was made,\r\nimposing duties upon glass, paper, India teas, &c. imported into the\r\ncolonies, it was said, that this was another instance of taxation,\r\nfor some of the dutied commodities were necessaries, we had them\r\nnot within ourselves, were prohibited from importing them from\r\nany place except Great Britain, were therefore obliged to import\r\nthem from Great Britain, and consequently, were obliged to pay the\r\nduties. Accordingly newspaper publications, pamphlets, resolves,\r\nnon-importation agreements, and the whole system of American\r\nopposition was again put in motion. We obtained a partial repeal of\r\nthis statute, which took off the duties from all the articles except\r\nteas. This was the lucky moment when to have closed the dispute. We\r\nmight have made a safe and honorable retreat. We had gained much,\r\nperhaps more than we expected. If the parliament had passed an act\r\ndeclaratory of their right to tax us, our assemblies had resolved,\r\nten times, that they had no such right. We could not complain of\r\nthe three-penny duty on tea as burdensome, for a shilling which\r\nhad been laid upon it, for the purpose of regulating trade, and\r\ntherefore was allowed to be constitutional, was taken off; so that\r\nwe were in fact gainers nine-pence in a pound by the new regulation.\r\nIf the appropriation of the revenue, arising from this statute was\r\ndisrelished, it was only our striking off one article of luxury\r\nfrom our manner of living, an article too, which if we may believe\r\nthe resolves of most of the towns in this province, or rely on its\r\ncollected wisdom in a resolve of the house of representatives, was to\r\nthe last degree ruinous to health. It was futile to urge its being\r\na precedent, as a reason for keeping up the ball of contention; for,\r\nallowing the supreme legislature ever to want a precedent, they had\r\nmany for laying duties on commodities imported into the colonies. And\r\nbeside we had great reason to believe that the remaining part of the\r\nstatute would be repealed, as soon as the parliament should suppose\r\nit could be done with honor to themselves, as the incidental revenue\r\narising from the former regulation, was four fold to the revenue\r\narising from the latter. A claim of the right, could work no injury,\r\nso long as there was no grievous exercise of it, especially as we had\r\nprotested against it, through the whole, and could not be said to\r\nhave departed from our claims in the least. We might now upon good\r\nterms have dropped the dispute, and been happy in the affections of\r\nour mother country; but that is yet to come. Party is inseperable\r\nfrom a free state. The several distributions of power, as they are\r\nlimited by, so they create perpetual dissentions between each other,\r\nabout their respective boundaries; but the greatest source is the\r\ncompetition of individuals for preferment in the state. Popularity\r\nis the ladder by which the partizans usually climb. Accordingly, the\r\nstruggle is, who shall have the greatest share of it. Each party\r\nprofesses disinterested patriotism, though some cynical writers\r\nhave ventured to assert, that self-love is the ruling passion of\r\nthe whole. There were two parties in this province of pretty long\r\nstanding, known by the name of whig and tory, which at this time were\r\nnot a little imbittered against each other. Men of abilities and\r\nacknowledged probity were on both sides. If the tories were suspected\r\nof pursuing their private interest through the medium of court favor,\r\nthere was equal reason to suspect the whigs of pursuing their private\r\ninterest by the means of popularity. Indeed some of them owed all\r\ntheir importance to it, and must in a little time have sunk into\r\nobscurity, had these turbulent commotions then subsided.\r\n\r\nThe tories and whigs took different routs, as usual. The tories\r\nwere for closing the controversy with Great Britain, the whigs for\r\ncontinuing it; the tories were for restoring government in the\r\nprovince, which had become greatly relaxed by these convulsions,\r\nto its former tone; the whigs were averse to it; they even refused\r\nto revive a temporary riot act, which expired about this time.\r\nPerhaps they thought that mobs were a necessary ingredient in their\r\nsystem of opposition. However, the whigs had great advantages in the\r\nunequal combat; their scheme flattered the people with the idea of\r\nindependence; the tories' plan supposed a degree of subordination,\r\nwhich is rather an humiliating idea; besides there is a propensity\r\nin men to believe themselves injured and oppressed whenever they\r\nare told so. The ferment, raised in their minds in the time of the\r\nstamp-act, was not yet allayed, and the leaders of the whigs had\r\ngained the confidence of the people by their successes in their\r\nformer struggles, so that they had nothing to do but to keep up the\r\nspirit among the people, and they were sure of commanding in this\r\nprovince. It required some pains to prevent their minds settling into\r\nthat calm, which is ordinarily the effect of a mild government; the\r\nwhigs were sensible that there was no oppression that could be either\r\nseen or felt; if any thing was in reality amiss in government, it was\r\nits being too lax. So far was it from the innocent being in danger of\r\nsuffering, that the most atrocious offenders escaped with impunity.\r\nThey accordingly applied themselves to work upon the imagination,\r\nand to inflame the passions; for this work they possessed great\r\ntalents; I will do justice to their ingenuity; they were intimately\r\nacquainted with the feelings of man, and knew all the avenues to the\r\nhuman heart. Effigies, paintings, and other imagery were exhibited;\r\nthe fourteenth of August was celebrated annually as a festival in\r\ncommemoration of a mob's destroying a building, owned by the late\r\nLieutenant Governor, which was supposed to have been erected for a\r\nstamp-office; and compelling him to resign his office of stamp-master\r\nunder liberty tree; annual orations were delivered in the old south\r\nmeeting house, on the fifth of March, the day when some persons were\r\nunfortunately killed by a party of the twenty-ninth regiment; lists\r\nof imaginary grievances were continually published; the people were\r\ntold weekly that the ministry had formed a plan to enslave them;\r\nthat the duty upon tea was only a prelude to a window tax, hearth\r\ntax, land tax, and poll tax; and these were only paving the way\r\nfor reducing the country to lordships. This last bait was the more\r\neasily swallowed, as there seems to be an apprehension of that kind\r\nhereditary to people of New-England; and were conjured by the duty\r\nthey owed themselves, their country, and their God, by the reverence\r\ndue to the sacred memory of their ancestors, and all their toils\r\nand sufferings in this once inhospitable wilderness, and by their\r\naffections for unborn millions, to rouse and exert themselves in the\r\ncommon cause. This perpetual incantation kept the people in continual\r\nalarm. We were further stimulated by being told, that the people\r\nof England were depraved, the parliament venal, and the ministry\r\ncorrupt; nor were attempts wanting to traduce Majesty itself. The\r\nkingdom of Great Britain was depicted as an ancient structure, once\r\nthe admiration of the world, now sliding from its base, and rushing\r\nto its fall. At the same time we were called upon to mark our own\r\nrapid growth, and behold the certain evidence that America was upon\r\nthe eve of independent empire.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider what effect a well written tragedy or novel has\r\non the human passions, though we know it to be all fictitious,\r\nwhat effect must all this be supposed to have had upon those, that\r\nbelieved these high wrought images to be realities?\r\n\r\nThe tories have been censured for remissness in not having exerted\r\nthemselves sufficiently at this period. The truth of the case is\r\nthis; they saw and shuddered at the gathering storm, but durst not\r\nattempt to dispel it, lest it should burst on their own heads.\r\nPrinters were threatened with the loss of their bread, for\r\npublishing freely on the tory side. One Mr. Mein was forced to fly\r\nthe country for persisting in it.\r\n\r\nAll our dissenting ministers were not inactive on this occasion.\r\nWhen the clergy engage in a political warfare, religion becomes a\r\nmost powerful engine, either to support or overthrow the state. What\r\neffect must it have had upon the audience to hear the same sentiments\r\nand principles, which they had before read in a newspaper, delivered\r\non Sundays from the sacred desk, with a religious awe, and the most\r\nsolemn appeals to heaven, from lips which they had been taught, from\r\ntheir cradles, to believe could utter nothing but eternal truths?\r\nWhat was it natural to expect from a people bred under a free\r\nconstitution, jealous of their liberty, credulous, even to a proverb,\r\nwhen told their privileges were in danger, thus wrought upon in the\r\nextreme? I answer, outrages disgraceful to humanity itself. What\r\nmischief was not an artful man, who had obtained the confidence and\r\nguidance of such an enraged multitude, capable of doing? He had only\r\nto point out this or the other man, as an enemy of his country; and\r\nno character, station, age, or merit could protect the proscribed\r\nfrom their fury. Happy was it for him, if he could secrete his\r\nperson, and subject his property only to their lawless ravages. By\r\nsuch means, many people naturally brave and humane, have been wrought\r\nupon to commit such acts of private mischief and public violence, as\r\nwill blacken many a page in the history of our country.\r\n\r\nI shall next trace the effects of this spirit, which the whigs had\r\nthus infused into the body of the people, through the courts of\r\ncommon law, and the general assembly, and mark the ways and means,\r\nwhereby they availed themselves of it, to the subversion of our\r\ncharter constitution, antecedent to the late acts of parliament.\r\n\r\nMASSACHUSETTENSIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESSED\r\n\r\n_To the Inhabitants of the Province of Massachusetts Bay_,\r\n\r\nDecember 26, 1774.\r\n\r\n\r\nMY DEAR COUNTRYMEN,\r\n\r\nTo undertake to convince a person of his error, is the indispensible\r\nduty, the certain, though dangerous test of friendship. He that could\r\nsee his friend persevering in a fatal error, without reminding him of\r\nit, and striving to reclaim him, through fear that he might thereby\r\nincur his displeasure, would little deserve the sacred name himself.\r\nSuch delicacy is not only false, but criminal. Were I not fully\r\nconvinced upon the most mature deliberation, that I am capable of,\r\nthat the temporal salvation of this province depends upon an entire\r\nand speedy change of measures, which must depend upon a change of\r\nsentiment, respecting our own conduct, and the justice of the British\r\nnation, I never should have obtruded myself on the public. I repeat\r\nmy promise, to avoid personal reflection, as much as the nature of\r\nthe task will admit of; but will continue faithfully to expose the\r\nwretched policy of the whigs, though I may be obliged to penetrate\r\nthe arcana, and discover such things as, were there not a necessity\r\nfor it, I should be infinitely happier in drawing a veil over, or\r\ncovering with a mantle. Should I be so unfortunate as to incur your\r\ndispleasure, I shall nevertheless think myself happy, if I can but\r\nsnatch one of my fellow-subjects as a brand out of the burning.\r\n\r\nPerhaps some may imagine that I have represented too many of my\r\ncountrymen, as well as the leading whigs, in an unjust point of\r\nlight, by supposing these so wicked as to mislead, or those so little\r\ncircumspect as to be misled, in matters of the last importance.\r\nWhoever has been conversant with the history of man, must know that\r\nit abounds with such instances. The same game, and with the same\r\nsuccess, has been played in all ages, and all countries.\r\n\r\nThe bulk of the people are generally but little versed in matters of\r\nstate. Want of inclination or opportunity to figure in public life,\r\nmakes them content to rest the affairs of government in the hands,\r\nwhere accident or merit has placed them. Their views and employments\r\nare confined to the humbler walks of business or retirement. There\r\nis a latent spark however, in their breasts, capable of being\r\nkindled into a flame; to do this has always been the employment of\r\nthe disaffected. They begin by reminding the people of the elevated\r\nrank they hold in the universe, as men; that all men by nature are\r\nequal; that kings are but the ministers of the people; that their\r\nauthority is delegated to them by the people for their good, and they\r\nhave a right to resume it, and place it in other hands, or keep it\r\nthemselves, whenever it is made use of to oppress them. Doubtless\r\nthere have been instances where these principles have been inculcated\r\nto obtain a redress of real grievances, but they have been much\r\noftener perverted to the worst of purposes. No government, however\r\nperfect in theory, is administered in perfection; the frailty of man\r\ndoes not admit of it. A small mistake, in point of policy, often\r\nfurnishes a pretence to libel government, and persuade the people\r\nthat their rulers are tyrants, and the whole government a system of\r\noppression. Thus the seeds of sedition are usually sown, and the\r\npeople are led to sacrifice real liberty to licentiousness, which\r\ngradually ripens into rebellion and civil war. And what is still\r\nmore to be lamented, the generality of the people, who are thus made\r\nthe dupes of artifice, and the mere stilts of ambition, are sure\r\nto be losers in the end. The best they can expect, is to be thrown\r\nneglected by, when they are no longer wanted; but they are seldom so\r\nhappy; if they are subdued, confiscation of estate and ignominious\r\ndeath are their portion; if they conquer, their own army is often\r\nturned upon them, to subjugate them to a more tyranical government\r\nthan that they rebelled against. History is replete with instances\r\nof this kind; we can trace them in remote antiquity, we find them\r\nin modern times, and have a remarkable one in the very country from\r\nwhich we are derived. It is an universal truth, that he that would\r\nexcite a rebellion, whatever professions of philanthropy he may make,\r\nwhen he is insinuating and worming himself into the good graces of\r\nthe people, is at heart as great a tyrant as ever wielded the iron\r\nrod of oppression. I shall have occasion hereafter to consider this\r\nmatter more fully, when I shall endeavour to convince you how little\r\nwe can gain, and how much we may lose, by this unequal, unnatural,\r\nand desperate contest. My present business is, to trace the spirit\r\nof opposition to Great Britain through the general court, and the\r\ncourts of common law. In moderate times, a representative that votes\r\nfor an unpopular measure, or opposes a popular one, is in danger of\r\nlosing his election the next year; when party runs high, he is sure\r\nto do it. It was the policy of the whigs to have their questions,\r\nupon high matters, determined by yea and nay votes, which were\r\npublished with the representatives' names in the next gazette. This\r\nwas commonly followed by severe strictures and the most illiberal\r\ninvectives upon the dissentients; sometimes they were held up as\r\nobjects of resentment, of contempt at others; the abuse was in\r\nproportion to the extravagance of the measure they opposed. This\r\nmay seem not worth notice, but its consequences were important. The\r\nscurrility made its way into the dissentient's town, it furnished his\r\ncompetitor with means to supplant him, and he took care to shun the\r\nrock his predecessor had split upon. In this temper of the times, it\r\nwas enough to know who voted with Cassius and who with Lucius, to\r\ndetermine who was a friend and who an enemy to the country, without\r\nonce adverting to the question before the house. The loss of a seat\r\nin the house was not of so much consequence; but when once he became\r\nstigmatized as an enemy to his country, he was exposed to insult; and\r\nif his profession or business was such, that his livelihood depended\r\nmuch on the good graces of his fellow citizens, he was in danger of\r\nlosing his bread, and involving his whole family in ruin.\r\n\r\nOne particular set of members, in committee, always prepared the\r\nresolves and other spirited measures. At first they were canvassed\r\nfreely, at length would slide through the house without meeting\r\nan obstacle. The lips of the dissentients were sealed up; they\r\nsat in silence, and beheld with infinite regret the measures they\r\ndurst not oppose. Many were borne down against their wills, by the\r\nviolence of the current; upon no other principle can we reconcile\r\ntheir ostensible conduct in the house to their declarations in\r\nprivate circles. The apparent unanimity in the house encouraged the\r\nopposition out of doors, and that in its turn strengthened the party\r\nin the house. Thus they went on mutually supporting and up-lifting\r\neach other. Assemblies and towns resolved alternately; some of them\r\nonly omitted resolving to snatch the sceptre out of the hands of our\r\nsovereign, and to strike the imperial crown from his sacred head.\r\n\r\nA master stroke in politics respecting the agent, ought not to be\r\nneglected. Each colony has usually an agent residing at the court of\r\nGreat Britain. These agents are appointed by the three branches of\r\ntheir several assemblies; and indeed there cannot be a provincial\r\nagent without such appointment. The whigs soon found that they could\r\nnot have such services rendered them from a provincial agent, as\r\nwould answer their purposes. The house therefore refused to join\r\nwith the other two branches of the general court in the appointment.\r\nThe house chose an agent for themselves, and the council appointed\r\nanother. Thus we had two agents for private purposes, and the expence\r\nof agency doubled; and with equal reason a third might have been\r\nadded, as agent for the Governor, and the charges been trebled.\r\n\r\nThe additional expence was of little consideration, compared with\r\nanother inconvenience that attended this new mode of agency. The\r\nperson appointed by the house was the ostensible agent of the\r\nprovince, though in fact he was only the agent of a few individuals\r\nthat had got the art of managing the house at their pleasure. He knew\r\nhis continuing in office depended upon them. An office, that yielded\r\nseveral hundred pounds sterling annually, the business of which\r\nconsisted in little more than attending the levees of the great, and\r\nwriting letters to America, was worth preserving. Thus he was under a\r\nstrong temptation to sacrifice the province to a party; and ecchoed\r\nback the sentiments of his patrons.\r\n\r\nThe advices continually received from one of the persons, that was\r\nthus appointed agent, had great influence upon the members of the\r\nhouse of more moderate principles. He had pushed his researches deep\r\ninto nature, and made important discoveries: they thought he had done\r\nthe same in politics, and did not admire him less as a politician,\r\nthan as a philosopher. His intelligence as to the disposition of his\r\nmajesty, the ministry, the parliament and the nation in general, was\r\ndeemed the most authentic. He advised us to keep up our opposition,\r\nto resolve, and re-resolve, to cherish a military spirit, uniformly\r\nholding up this idea, that if we continued firm, we had nothing to\r\nfear from the government in England. He even proposed some modes of\r\nopposition himself. The spirited measures were always ushered into\r\nthe house with a letter from him. I have been sometimes almost ready\r\nto suspect him of being the _primum mobile_, and, that like the man\r\nbehind the curtain at a puppet-shew, he was playing off the figures\r\nhere with his own secret wires. If he advised to these measures\r\ncontrary to his better knowledge, from sinister views, and to serve\r\na private purpose, he has _wilfully_ done the province irreparable\r\ninjury. However, I will do him justice; he enjoined it upon us to\r\nrefrain from violence, as that would unite the nation against us;\r\nand I am rather inclined to think that he was deceived himself,\r\nwith respect to the measures he recommended, as he has already felt\r\nthe resentment of that very government, which he told us there was\r\nnothing to fear from. This disposition of the house could not have\r\nproduced such fatal effects, had the other two branches of the\r\nlegislature retained their constitutional freedom and influence. They\r\nmight have been a sufficient check.\r\n\r\nThe councellors depended upon the general assembly for their\r\npolitical existence; the whigs reminded the council of their\r\nmortality. If a councellor opposed the violent measures of the whigs\r\nwith any spirit, he lost his election the next May. The council\r\nconsisted of twenty-eight. From this principle, near half that\r\nnumber, mostly men of the first families, note and abilities, with\r\nevery possible attachment to their native country, and as far from\r\ntemptation as wealth and independence could remove them, were tumbled\r\nfrom their seats in disgrace. Thus the board, which was intended to\r\nmoderate between the two extremes of prerogative and privilege, lost\r\nits weight in the scale, and the political balance of the province\r\nwas destroyed.\r\n\r\nHad the chair been able to retain its own constitutional influence,\r\nthe loss of the board would have been less felt; but no longer\r\nsupported by the board, that fell likewise. The Governor by the\r\ncharter could do little or nothing without the council. If he called\r\nupon a military officer to raise the militia, he was answered,\r\nthey were there already. If he called upon his council for their\r\nassistance, they must first enquire into the cause. If he wrote to\r\ngovernment at home to strengthen his hands, some officious person\r\nprocured and sent back his letters.\r\n\r\nIt was not the person of a Bernard or Hutchinson that made them\r\nobnoxious; any other governors would have met with the same fate, had\r\nthey discharged their duty with equal fidelity; that is, had they\r\nstrenuously opposed the principles and practices of the whigs; and\r\nwhen they found that the government here could not support itself,\r\nwrote home for aid sufficient to do it. And let me tell you, had\r\nthe intimations in those letters, which you are taught to execrate,\r\nbeen timely attended to, we had now been as happy a people as good\r\ngovernment could make us. Gov. Bernard came here recommended by the\r\naffections of the province over which he had presided. His abilities\r\nare acknowledged. True British honesty and punctuality are traits in\r\nhis character, too strongly marked to escape the eye of prejudice\r\nitself. We know Governor Hutchinson to be amiable and exemplary\r\nin private life. His great abilities, integrity and humanity were\r\nconspicuous, in the several important departments that he filled,\r\nbefore his appointment to the chair, and reflect honour on his native\r\ncountry. But his abilities and integrity, added to his thorough\r\nknowledge of the province, in all its interests and connexions,\r\nwere insufficient in this case. The constitution itself was gone,\r\nthough the ancient form remained; the spirit was truly republican.\r\nHe endeavoured to reclaim us by gentle means. He strove to convince\r\nus by arguments, drawn from the first principles of government; our\r\nseveral charters, and the express acknowledgments of our ancestors,\r\nthat our claims were inconsistent with the subordination due to Great\r\nBritain; and if persisted in, might work the destruction of those\r\nthat we were entitled to. For this he was called an enemy to his\r\ncountry, and set up as a mark for the envenomed arrows of malice and\r\nparty rage. Had I entertained a doubt about its being the governor,\r\nand not the man that was aimed at, the admirable facility with which\r\nthe newspaper abuse was transferred from Gov. Hutchinson to his\r\nhumane and benevolent successor, Gen. Gage, almost as soon as he set\r\nfoot on our shore, would have removed it.\r\n\r\nThus, disaffection to Great Britain being infused into the body\r\nof the people, the subtle poison stole through all the veins and\r\narteries, contaminated the blood, and destroyed the very stamina of\r\nthe constitution. Had not the courts of justice been tainted in the\r\nearly stages, our government might have expelled the virus, purged\r\noff the peccant humors, and recovered its former vigour by its own\r\nstrength. The judges of the superior court were dependant upon the\r\nannual grants of the general court for their support. Their salaries\r\nwere small, in proportion to the salaries of other officers in the\r\ngovernment, of less importance.\r\n\r\nThey had often petitioned the assembly to enlarge them, without\r\nsuccess. They were at this time reminded of their dependance.\r\nHowever, it is but justice to say, that the judges remained unshaken,\r\namid the raging tempests, which is to be attributed rather to their\r\nfirmness than situation. But the spirit of the times was very\r\napparent in the juries. The grand jurors were elective; and in such\r\nplaces where libels, riots, and insurrections were the most frequent,\r\nthe high whigs took care to get themselves chosen. The judges pointed\r\nout to them the seditious libels on governors, magistrates, and the\r\nwhole government to no effect. They were enjoined to present riots\r\nand insurrections, of which there was ample evidence, with as little\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to account for so many of the first rate whigs\r\nbeing returned to serve on the petit jury at the term next after\r\nextraordinary insurrections, without supposing some legerdemain\r\nin drawing their names out of the box. It is certain that\r\nnotwithstanding swarms of the most virulent libels infested the\r\nprovince, and there were so many riots and insurrections, scarce one\r\noffender was indicted, and I think not one convicted and punished.\r\nCauses of _meum et tuum_ were not always exempt from party influence.\r\nThe mere circumstance of the whigs gaining the ascendency over the\r\ntories, is trifling. Had the whigs divided the province between\r\nthem, as they once flattered themselves they should be able to do,\r\nit would have been of little consequence to the community, had\r\nthey not cut asunder the very sinews of government, and broke in\r\npieces the ligaments of social life in the attempt. I will mention\r\ntwo instances, which I have selected out of many, of the weakness\r\nof our government, as they are recent and unconnected with acts\r\nof parliament. One Malcolm, a loyal subject, and as such entitled\r\nto protection, the evening before the last winter sessions of the\r\ngeneral court, was dragged out of his house, stript, tarred and\r\nfeathered, and carted several hours in the severest frost of that\r\nwinter, to the utmost hazard of his life. He was carried to the\r\ngallows with an halter about his neck, and in his passage to and\r\nfrom the gallows, was beaten with as cruel stripes as ever were\r\nadministered by the hands of a savage. The whipping, however, kept\r\nup the circulation of his blood, and saved the poor man's life. When\r\nthey had satiated their malice, they dispersed in good order. This\r\nwas transacted in the presence of thousands of spectators; some of\r\nwhom were members of the general court. Malcolm's life was despaired\r\nof several days, but he survived and presented a memorial to the\r\ngeneral assembly, praying their interposition. The petition was\r\nread, and all he obtained was leave to withdraw it. So that he was\r\ndestitute of protection every hour, until he left the country, as\r\nwere thousands beside, until the arrival of the king's troops. This\r\noriginated from a small fracas in the street, wherein Malcolm struck,\r\nor threatened to strike a person that insulted him, with a cutlass,\r\nand had no connection with the quarrel of the times, unless his\r\nsustaining a small post in the customs made it.\r\n\r\nThe other instance is much stronger than this, as it was totally\r\ndetached from politics. It had been suspected that infection had\r\nbeen communicated from an hospital, lately erected at Marblehead,\r\nfor the purpose of innoculating the small-pox, to the town's people.\r\nThis caused a great insurrection; the insurgents burnt the hospital;\r\nnot content with that, threatened the proprietors, and many others,\r\nsome of the first fortunes and characters in the town, with burning\r\ntheir houses over their heads, and continued parading the streets,\r\nto the utmost terror of the inhabitants several days. A massacre and\r\ngeneral devastation was apprehended. The persons threatened, armed\r\nthemselves, and petitioned the general assembly, which was then\r\nsitting, for assistance, as there was little or no civil authority in\r\nthe place. A committee was ordered to repair to Marblehead, report\r\nthe facts, and enquire into the cause. The committee reported the\r\nfacts nearly as stated in the petition. The report was accepted, and\r\nnothing farther done by the assembly. Such demonstrations of the\r\nweakness of government induced many persons to join the whigs, to\r\nseek from them that protection, which the constitutional authority of\r\nthe province was unable to afford.\r\n\r\nGovernment at home, early in the day, made an effort to check us\r\nin our career, and to enable us to recover from anarchy without\r\nher being driven to the necessity of altering our provincial\r\nconstitution, knowing the predilection that people always have for\r\nan ancient form of government. The judges of the superior court had\r\nnot been staggered, though their feet stood in slippery places, they\r\ndepended upon the leading whigs for their support. To keep them\r\nsteady, they were made independent of the grants of the general\r\nassembly: but it was not a remedy any way adequate to the disease.\r\nThe whigs now turned their artillery against them, and it played\r\nbriskly. The chief justice, for accepting the crown grant, was\r\naccused of receiving a royal bribe.\r\n\r\nThus, my friends, those very persons that had made you believe that\r\nevery attempt to strengthen government and save our charter was an\r\ninfringement of your privileges, by little and little destroyed\r\nyour real liberty, subverted your charter constitution, abridged\r\nthe freedom of the house, annihilated the freedom of the board,\r\nand rendered the governor a mere doge of Venice. They engrossed\r\nall the power of the province into their own hands. A democracy\r\nor republic it has been called, but it does not deserve the name\r\nof either; it was, however, a despotism cruelly carried into\r\nexecution by mobs and riots, and more incompatible with the rights\r\nof mankind, than the enormous monarchies of the East. The absolute\r\nnecessity of the interposition of parliament is apparent. The good\r\npolicy of the act for regulating the government in this province,\r\nwill be the subject of some future paper. A particular enquiry\r\ninto the despotism of the whigs will be deferred for a chapter on\r\ncongresses. I shall next ask your attention to a transaction, as\r\nimportant in its consequences, and perhaps more so, than any I have\r\nyet mentioned; I mean the destruction of the tea, belonging to the\r\nEast-India company. I am sensible of the difficulty of the task, in\r\ncombating generally received opinions. It is hard work to eradicate\r\ndeep-rooted prejudice. But I will persevere. There are hundreds, if\r\nnot thousands, in the province, that will feel the truth of what\r\nI have written, line by line as they read it, and as to those who\r\nobstinately shut their eyes against it now, haply the fever of the\r\ntimes may intermit, there may be some lucid interval, when their\r\nminds shall be open to truth, before it is too late to serve them;\r\notherwise it will be revealed to them in bitter moments, attended\r\nwith keen remorse and unutterable anguish. _Magna est veritas et\r\nprevalebit._\r\n\r\nMASSACHUSETTENSIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESSED\r\n\r\n_To the Inhabitants of the Province of Massachusetts Bay_,\r\n\r\nJanuary 2, 1775.\r\n\r\n\r\nMY DEAR COUNTRYMEN,\r\n\r\nPerhaps by this time some of you may enquire who it is, that suffers\r\nhis pen to run so freely? I will tell you; it is a native of this\r\nprovince, that knew it before many that are now basking in the rays\r\nof political sunshine, had a being. He was favored not by whigs\r\nor tories, but the people, with such a stand in the community, as\r\nthat he could distinctly see all the political manoeuvres of the\r\nprovince. He saw some with pleasure, others with pain. If he condemns\r\nthe conduct of the whigs, he does not always approve of the conduct\r\nof the tories. He dwells upon the misconduct of the former, because\r\nwe are indebted to that for bringing us into this wretched state,\r\nunless the supineness of the latter, at some periods, and some\r\nimpolitic efforts to check the whigs in their career, at others,\r\nthat served like adding fuel to the fire, ought to be added to the\r\naccount. He is now repaying your favors, if he knows his own heart,\r\nfrom the purest gratitude and the most undissembled patriotism, which\r\nwill one day be acknowledged. I saw the small seed of sedition, when\r\nit was implanted; it was, as a grain of mustard. I have watched the\r\nplant until it has become a great tree; the vilest reptiles that\r\ncrawl upon the earth, are concealed at the root; the foulest birds of\r\nthe air rest upon its branches. I now would induce you to go to work\r\nimmediately with axes and hatchets, and cut it down, for a twofold\r\nreason; because it is a pest to society, and lest it be felled\r\nsuddenly by a stronger arm and crush its thousands in the fall.\r\n\r\nAn apprehension of injustice in the conduct of Great Britain towards\r\nus, I have already told you was one source of our misery. Last week\r\nI endeavoured to convince you of the necessity of her regulating, or\r\nrather establishing some government amongst us. I am now to point\r\nout the principles and motives upon which the blockade act was made.\r\nThe violent attack upon the property of the East-India company, in\r\nthe destruction of their tea, was the cause of it. In order to form\r\na right judgment of that transaction, it is necessary to go back and\r\nview the cause of its being sent here. As the government of England\r\nis mixt, so the spirit or genius of the nation is at once monarchial,\r\naristocratical, democratical, martial and commercial. It is difficult\r\nto determine which is the most predominant principle, but it is\r\nworthy of remark, that, to injure the British nation upon either of\r\nthese points, is like injuring a Frenchman in the point of honor.\r\nCommerce is the great source of national wealth; for this reason it\r\nis cherished by all orders of men from the palace to the cottage.\r\nIn some countries, a merchant is held in contempt by the nobles;\r\nin England they respect him. He rises to high honors in the state,\r\noften contracts alliances with the first families in the kingdom, and\r\nnoble blood flows in the veins of his posterity. Trade is founded\r\nupon persons or countries mutually supplying each other with their\r\nredundances. Thus none are impoverished, all enriched, the asperities\r\nof human life worne away, and mankind made happier by it. Husbandry,\r\nmanufacture and merchandize are its triple support; deprived of\r\neither of these, it would cease.\r\n\r\nAgriculture is the natural livelihood of a country but thinly\r\ninhabited, as arts and manufactures are of a populous one. The high\r\nprice of labour prevents manufactures being carried on to advantage\r\nin the first, scarcity of soil obliges the inhabitants to pursue\r\nthem in the latter. Upon these, and considerations arising from\r\nthe fertility and produce of different climates, and such like\r\nprinciples, the grand system of the British trade is founded. The\r\ncollected wisdom of the nation has always been attentive to this\r\ngreat point of policy, that the national trade might be so balanced\r\nand poised, as that each part of her extended dominions might be\r\nbenefitted, and the whole concentre to the good of the empire. This\r\nevinces the necessity of acts for regulating trade.\r\n\r\nTo prevent one part of the empire being enriched at the expence and\r\nto the impoverishing of another, checks, restrictions, and sometimes\r\nabsolute prohibitions are necessary. These are imposed or taken off\r\nas circumstances vary. To carry the acts of trade into execution,\r\nmany officers are necessary. Thus, we see a number of custom-house\r\nofficers, so constituted as to be checks and controuls upon each\r\nother, and prevent their swerving from their duty, should they be\r\ntempted, and a board of commissioners appointed to superintend the\r\nwhole, like the commissioners of the customs in England. Hence also\r\narises the necessity of courts of admiralty.\r\n\r\nThe laws and regulations of trade, are esteemed in England, as\r\nsacred. An estate made by smuggling or pursuing an illicit trade, is\r\nthere looked upon as filthy lucre, as monies amassed by gaming, and\r\nupon the same principle, because it is obtained at the expence, and\r\noften ruin of others. The smuggler not only injures the public, but\r\noften ruins the fair trader.\r\n\r\nThe great extent of sea-coast, many harbours, the variety of islands,\r\nthe numerous creeks and navigable rivers, afford the greatest\r\nopportunity to drive an illicit trade, in these colonies, without\r\ndetection. This advantage has not been overlooked by the avaricious,\r\nand many persons seem to have set the laws of trade at defiance.\r\nThis accounts for so many new regulations being made, new officers\r\nappointed, and ships of war, from time to time, stationed along the\r\ncontinent. The way to Holland and back again is well known, and by\r\nmuch the greatest part of the tea that has been drank in America\r\nfor several years, has been imported from thence and other places,\r\nin direct violation of law. By this the smugglers have amassed great\r\nestates, to the prejudice of the fair trader. It was sensibly felt\r\nby the East-India company; they were prohibited from exporting their\r\nteas to America, and were obliged to sell it at auction in London;\r\nthe London merchant purchased it, and put a profit upon it when he\r\nshipt it for America; the American merchant, in his turn, put a\r\nprofit upon it, and after him the shopkeeper; so that it came to\r\nthe consumer's hands, at a very advanced price. Such quantities of\r\ntea were annually smuggled that it was scarcely worth while for the\r\nAmerican merchant to import tea from England at all. Some of the\r\nprincipal trading towns in America were wholly supplied with this\r\ncommodity by smuggling; Boston however continued to import it, until\r\nadvice was received that the parliament had it in contemplation to\r\npermit the East-India company to send their teas directly to America.\r\nThe Boston merchants then sent their orders conditionally to their\r\ncorrespondents in England, to have tea shipt for them in case the\r\nEast-India company's tea did not come out; one merchant, a great\r\nwhig, had such an order lying in England for sixty chests, on his own\r\naccount, when the company's tea was sent. An act of parliament was\r\nmade to enable the East-India company to send their tea directly to\r\nAmerica, and sell it at auction there, not with a view of raising a\r\nrevenue from the three penny duty, but to put it out of the power of\r\nthe smugglers to injure them by their infamous trade. We have it from\r\ngood authority, that the revenue was not the consideration before\r\nparliament, and it is reasonable to suppose it; for had that been the\r\npoint in view, it was only to restore the former regulation, which\r\nwas then allowed to be constitutional, and the revenue would have\r\nbeen respectable. Had this new regulation taken effect, the people in\r\nAmerica would have been great gainers. The wholesale merchant might\r\nhave been deprived of some of his gains; but the retailer would have\r\nsupplied himself with this article, directly from the auction, and\r\nthe consumer reap the benefit, as tea would have been sold under the\r\nprice that had been usual, by near one half. Thus the country in\r\ngeneral would have been great gainers, the East-India company secured\r\nin supplying the American market with this article, which they are\r\nentitled to by the laws of trade, and smuggling suppressed, at least\r\nas to tea. A smuggler and a whig are cousin germans, the offspring\r\nof two sisters, avarice and ambition. They had been playing into\r\neach others hands a long time. The smuggler received protection from\r\nthe whig, and he in his turn received support from the smuggler.\r\nThe illicit trader now demanded protection from his kinsman, and it\r\nwould have been unnatural in him to have refused it; and beside,\r\nan opportunity presented of strengthening his own interest. The\r\nconsignees were connected with the tories, and that was a further\r\nstimulus. Accordingly the press was again set to work, and the old\r\nstory repeated with addition about monopolies, and many infatuated\r\npersons once more wrought up to a proper pitch to carry into\r\nexecution any violent measures, that their leaders should propose.\r\nA bold stroke was resolved upon. The whigs, though they had got the\r\nart of managing the people, had too much sense to be ignorant that\r\nit was all a mere finesse, not only without, but directly repugnant\r\nto law, constitution and government, and could not last always. They\r\ndetermined to put all at hazard, and to be _aut Cæsar aut nullus_.\r\nThe approaching storm was foreseen, and the first ship that arrived\r\nwith the tea, detained below Castle William. A body meeting was\r\nassembled at the old south meeting-house, which has great advantage\r\nover a town meeting, as no law has yet ascertained the qualification\r\nof the voters; each person present, of whatever age, estate or\r\ncountry, may take the liberty to speak or vote at such an assembly;\r\nand that might serve as a screen to the town where it originated,\r\nin case of any disastrous consequence. The body meeting consisting\r\nof several thousands, being thus assembled, with the leading whigs\r\nat its head, in the first place sent for the owner of the tea ship,\r\nand required him to bring her to the wharf, upon pain of their\r\ndispleasure; the ship was accordingly brought up, and the master was\r\nobliged to enter at the custom house. He reported the tea, after\r\nwhich twenty days are allowed for landing it and paying the duty.\r\n\r\nThe next step was to resolve. They resolved that the tea should not\r\nbe landed nor the duty paid, that it should go home in the same\r\nbottom that it came in, &c. &c. This was the same as resolving to\r\ndestroy it, for as the ship had been compelled to come to the wharf,\r\nand was entered at the custom house, it could not, by law, be cleared\r\nout, without the duties being first paid, nor could the governor\r\ngrant a permit for the vessel to pass Castle William, without a\r\ncertificate from the custom house of such clearance, consistent\r\nwith his duty. The body accordingly, ordered a military guard to\r\nwatch the ship every night until further orders. The consignees had\r\nbeen applied to, by the selectmen, to send the tea to England, they\r\nanswered that they could not; for if they did, it would be forfeited\r\nby the acts of trade, and they should be liable to make good the loss\r\nto the East India company. Some of the consignees were mobbed, and\r\nall were obliged to fly to the castle, and there immure themselves.\r\nThey petitioned the governor and council to take the property of\r\nthe East India company under their protection. The council declined\r\nbeing concerned in it. The consignees then offered the body to store\r\nthe tea under the care of the selectmen or a committee of the town\r\nof Boston, and to have no further concern in the matter until they\r\ncould send to England, and receive further instructions from their\r\nprincipals. This was refused with disdain. The military guard was\r\nregularly kept in rotation till the eve of the twentieth day, when\r\nthe duties must have been paid, the tea landed, or be liable to\r\nseizure; then the military guard was withdrawn, or rather omitted\r\nbeing posted, and a number of persons in disguise, forcibly entered\r\nthe ships, (three being by this time arrived) split open the chests,\r\nand emptied all the tea, being of 10,000_l._ sterling value, into the\r\ndock, and perfumed the town with its fragrance. Another circumstance\r\nought not to be omitted: the afternoon before the destruction of the\r\ntea, the body sent the owner of one of the ships to the governor\r\nto demand a pass; he answered, that he would as soon give a pass\r\nfor that as any other vessel, if he had the proper certificate from\r\nthe custom house; without which he could not give a pass for any,\r\nconsistent with his duty. It was known that this would be the answer,\r\nwhen the message was sent, and it was with the utmost difficulty that\r\nthe body were kept together till the messenger returned. When the\r\nreport was made, a shout was set up in the galleries and at the door,\r\nand the meeting immediately dispersed. The governor had, previous\r\nto this, sent a proclamation by the sheriff, commanding the body\r\nto disperse; they permitted it to be read, and answered it with a\r\ngeneral hiss. These are the facts, as truly and fairly stated, as I\r\nam able to state them. The ostensible reason for this conduct, was\r\nthe tea's being subject to the three-penny duty. Let us take the\r\nadvocates for this transaction upon their own principle, and admit\r\nthe duty to be unconstitutional, and see how the argument stands.\r\nHere is a cargo of tea subject upon its being entered and landed,\r\nto a duty of three-pence per pound, which is paid by the East India\r\ncompany or by their factors, which amounts to the same thing. Unless\r\nwe purchase the tea, we shall never pay the duty; if we purchase it,\r\nwe pay the three-pence included in the price: therefore, lest we\r\nshould purchase it, we have a right to destroy it. A flimsy pretext!\r\nand either supposes the people destitute of virtue, or that their\r\npurchasing the tea was a matter of no importance to the community;\r\nbut even this gauze covering is stript off, when we consider that the\r\nBoston merchants, and some who were active at the body meeting, were\r\nevery day importing from England, large quantities of tea subject to\r\nthe same duty and vending it unmolested; and at this time had orders\r\nlying in their correspondent's hands, to send them considerable\r\nquantities of tea, in case the East-India company should not send it\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nWhen the news of this transaction arrived in England, and it was\r\nconsidered in what manner almost every other regulation of trade\r\nhad been evaded by artifice, and when artifice could no longer\r\nserve, recourse was had to violence; the British lion was roused.\r\nThe crown lawyers were called upon for the law; they answered, high\r\ntreason. Had a Cromwell, whom some amongst us deify and imitate in\r\nall his imitable perfections, had the guidance of the national ire,\r\nunless compensation had been made to the sufferers immediately upon\r\nits being demanded, your proud capital had been levelled with the\r\ndust; not content with that, rivers of blood would have been shed to\r\nmake atonement for the injured honor of the nation. It was debated\r\nwhether to attaint the principals of treason. We have a gracious\r\nking upon the throne; he felt the resentment of a man, softened by\r\nthe relentings of a parent. The bowels of our mother country yearned\r\ntowards her refractory, obstinate child.\r\n\r\nIt was determined to consider the offence in a milder light, and to\r\ncompel an indemnification for the sufferers, and prevent the like for\r\nthe future, by such means as would be mild, compared with the insult\r\nto the nation, or severe, as our future conduct should be; that was\r\nto depend upon us. Accordingly the blockade act was passed, and had\r\nan act of justice been done in indemnifying the sufferers, and an\r\nact of loyalty in putting a stop to seditious practices, our port\r\nhad long since been opened. This act has been called unjust, because\r\nit involves the innocent in the same predicament with the guilty;\r\nbut it ought to be considered, that our newspapers had announced to\r\nthe world, that several thousands attended those body meetings, and\r\nit did not appear that there was one dissentient, or any protest\r\nentered. I do not know how a person could expect distinction, in\r\nsuch a case, if he neglected to distinguish himself. When the noble\r\nlord proposed it in the house of commons, he called upon all the\r\nmembers present, to mention a better method of obtaining justice in\r\nthis case; scarce one denied the necessity of doing something, but\r\nnone could mention a more eligible way. Even ministerial opposition\r\nwas abashed. If any parts of the act strike us, like the severity\r\nof a master, let us coolly advert to the aggravated insult, and\r\nperhaps we shall wonder at the lenity of a parent. After this\r\ntransaction, all parties seem to have lain upon their oars, waiting\r\nto see what parliament would do. When the blockade act arrived,\r\nmany and many were desirous of paying for the tea immediately, and\r\nsome who were guiltless of the crime, offered to contribute to the\r\ncompensation; but our leading whigs must still rule the roost, and\r\nthat inauspicious influence that had brought us hitherto, plunged us\r\nstill deeper in misery. The whigs saw their ruin connected with a\r\ncompliance with the terms of opening the port, as it would furnish\r\na convincing proof of the wretchedness of their policy in the\r\ndestruction of the tea, and they might justly have been expected to\r\npay the money demanded themselves, and set themselves industriously\r\nto work to prevent it, and engage the other colonies to espouse their\r\ncause.\r\n\r\nThis was a crisis too important and alarming to the province to be\r\nneglected by its friends. A number of as respectable persons as\r\nany in this province, belonging to Boston, Cambridge, Salem and\r\nMarblehead, now came forward, publicly to disavow the proceedings\r\nof the whigs, to do justice to the much injured character of Mr.\r\nHutchinson, and to strengthen his influence at the court of Great\r\nBritain, where he was going to receive the well deserved plaudit\r\nof his sovereign, that he might be able to obtain a repeal or\r\nsome mitigation of that act, the terms of which they foresaw, the\r\nperverseness of the whigs would prevent a compliance with. This was\r\ndone by several addresses, which were subscribed by upwards of two\r\nhundred persons, and would have been by many more, had not the sudden\r\nembarkation of Mr. Hutchinson prevented it. The justices of the court\r\nof common pleas and general sessions of the peace for the county of\r\nPlymouth, sent their address to him in England. There were some of\r\nalmost all orders of men among these addressers, but they consisted\r\nprincipally of men of property, large family connections, and several\r\nwere independent in their circumstances, and lived wholly upon the\r\nincome of their estates. Some indeed might be called partizans;\r\nbut a very considerable proportion were persons that had of choice\r\nkept themselves at a distance from the political vortex; had beheld\r\nthe competition of the whigs and tories without any emotion, while\r\nthe community remained safe; had looked down on the political\r\ndance in its various mazes and intricacies, and saw one falling,\r\nanother rising, rather as a matter of amusement; but when they saw\r\nthe capital of the province upon the point of being sacrificed by\r\npolitical cunning, it called up all their feelings.\r\n\r\nTheir motives were truly patriotic. Let us now attend to the ways\r\nand means by which the whigs prevented these exertions producing\r\nsuch effects. Previous to this, a new, and until lately, unheard\r\nof, mode of opposition had been devised, said to be the invention\r\nof the fertile brain of one of our party agents, called a committee\r\nof correspondence. This is the foulest, subtlest, and most venomous\r\nserpent that ever issued from the eggs of sedition. These committees\r\ngenerally consist of the highest whigs, or at least there is some\r\nhigh whig upon them, that is the ruling spirit of the whole. They are\r\ncommonly appointed at thin town meetings, or if the meetings happen\r\nto be full, the moderate men seldom speak or act at all, when this\r\nsort of business comes on. They have been by much too modest. Thus\r\nthe meeting is often prefaced with, \"at a full town meeting,\" and\r\nthe several resolves headed with nem. con. with strict truth, when\r\nin fact, but a small proportion of the town have had a hand in the\r\nmatter. It is said that the committee for the town of Boston was\r\nappointed for a special purpose, and that their commission long since\r\nexpired. However that may be, these committees when once established,\r\nthink themselves amenable to none, they assume a dictatorial style,\r\nand have an opportunity under the apparent sanction of their several\r\ntowns, of clandestinely wreaking private revenge on individuals, by\r\ntraducing their characters, and holding them up as enemies to their\r\ncountry, wherever they go, as also of misrepresenting facts and\r\npropagating sedition through the country. Thus, a man of principle\r\nand property, in travelling through the country, would be insulted by\r\npersons, whose faces he had never before seen; he would often feel\r\nthe smart without suspecting the hand that administered the blow.\r\nThese committees, as they are not known in law, and can derive no\r\nauthority from thence, lest they should not get their share of power,\r\nsometimes engross it all; they frequently erect themselves into a\r\ntribunal, where the same persons are at once legislators, accusers,\r\nwitnesses, judges, and jurors, and the mob the executioners. The\r\naccused has no day in court, and the execution of the sentence is the\r\nfirst notice he receives. This is the channel through which liberty\r\nmatters have been chiefly conducted the summer and fall past. This\r\naccounts for the same distempers breaking out in different parts of\r\nthe province, at one and the same time, which might be attributed\r\nto something supernatural, by those that were unacquainted with the\r\nsecret conductors of the infection. It is chiefly owing to these\r\ncommittees, that so many respectable persons have been abused, and\r\nforced to sign recantations and resignations; that so many persons,\r\nto avoid such reiterated insults, as are more to be deprecated by\r\na man of sentiment than death itself, have been obliged to quit\r\ntheir houses, families, and business, and fly to the army for\r\nprotection; that husband has been separated from wife, father from\r\nson, brother from brother, the sweet intercourse of conjugal and\r\nnatural affection interrupted, and the unfortunate refugee forced to\r\nabandon all the comforts of domestic life. My countrymen, I beg you\r\nto pause and reflect on this conduct. Have not these people, that\r\nare thus insulted, as good a right to think and act for themselves\r\nin matters of the last importance, as the whigs? Are they not as\r\nclosely connected with the interest of their country as the whigs?\r\nDo not their former lives and conversations appear to have been\r\nregulated by principle, as much as those of the whigs? You must\r\nanswer, yes. Why, then, do you suffer them to be cruelly treated for\r\ndiffering in sentiment from you? Is it consistent with that liberty\r\nyou profess? Let us wave the consideration of right and liberty,\r\nand see if this conduct can be reconciled to good policy. Do you\r\nexpect to make converts by it? Persecution has the same effect in\r\npolitics, that it has in religion; it confirms the sectary. Do you\r\nwish to silence them, that the inhabitants of the province may appear\r\nunanimous? The maltreatment they receive, for differing from you, is\r\nundeniable evidence that we are not unanimous. It may not be amiss to\r\nconsider, that this is a changeable world, and time's rolling wheel\r\nmay ere long bring them uppermost; in that case I am sure you would\r\nnot wish to have them fraught with resentment. It is astonishing,\r\nmy friends, that those who are in pursuit of liberty, should ever\r\nsuffer arbitrary power, in such an hideous form and squalid hue,\r\nto get a footing among them. I appeal to your good sense; I know\r\nyou have it, and hope to penetrate to it, before I have finished my\r\npublications, notwithstanding the thick atmosphere that now envelopes\r\nit. But to return from my digression, the committee of correspondence\r\nrepresented the destruction of the tea in their own way; they\r\nrepresented those that addressed Gov. Hutchinson, as persons of no\r\nnote or property, as mean, base wretches, and seekers that had been\r\nsacrificing their country in adulation of him. Whole nations have\r\nworshipped the rising, but if this be an instance, it is the only\r\none of people's worshipping the setting sun. By this means the humane\r\nand benevolent, in various parts of the continent, were induced to\r\nadvise us not to comply with the terms for opening our port, and\r\nengage to relieve us with their charities, from the distress that\r\nmust otherwise fall upon the poor. Their charitable intentions ascend\r\nto heaven, like incense from the altar, in sweet memorial before\r\nthe throne of God; but their donations came near proving fatal to\r\nthe province. It encouraged the whigs to persevere in injustice,\r\nand has been the means of seducing many an honest man into the\r\ncommission of a crime, that he did not suspect himself capable of\r\nbeing guilty of. What I have told you, is not the mere suggestions\r\nof a speculatist; there are some mistakes as to numbers, and there\r\nmay be some as to time and place, partly owing to miscopying, and\r\npartly to my not always having had the books and papers necessary to\r\ngreater accuracy, at hand; but the relation of facts is in substance\r\ntrue, I had almost said, as holy writ. I do not ask you to take the\r\ntruths of them from an anonymous writer. The evidence of most of\r\nthem is within your reach; examine for yourselves. I promise that\r\nthe benefit you will reap therefrom will abundantly pay you, for the\r\ntrouble of the research; you will find I have faithfully unriddled\r\nthe whole mystery of our political iniquity. I do not address myself\r\nto whigs or tories, but to the whole people. I know you well. You are\r\nloyal at heart, friends to good order, and do violence to yourselves\r\nin harboring, one moment, disrespectful sentiments towards Great\r\nBritain, the land of our forefathers' nativity, and sacred repository\r\nof their bones; but you have been most insidiously induced to believe\r\nthat Great Britain is rapacious, cruel, and vindictive, and envies us\r\nthe inheritance purchased by the sweat and blood of our ancestors.\r\nCould that thick mist, that hovers over the land and involves in it\r\nmore than Egyptian darkness, be but once dispelled, that you might\r\nsee our Sovereign, the provident father of all his people, and Great\r\nBritain a nursing mother to these colonies, as they really are, long\r\nlive our gracious king, and happiness to Britain, would resound from\r\none end of the province to the other.\r\n\r\nMASSACHUSETTENSIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESSED\r\n\r\n_To the Inhabitants of the Province of Massachusetts Bay_,\r\n\r\nJanuary 9, 1775.\r\n\r\n\r\nMY DEAR COUNTRYMEN,\r\n\r\nSome of you may perhaps suspect that I have been wantonly scattering\r\nfirebrands, arrows, and death, to gratify a malicious and revengeful\r\ndisposition. The truth is this. I had seen many excellent detached\r\npieces, but could see no pen at work to trace our calamity to its\r\nsource, and point out the many adventitious aids, that conspired to\r\nraise it to its present height, though I impatiently expected it,\r\nbeing fully convinced that you wait only to know the true state of\r\nfacts, to rectify whatever is amiss in the province, without any\r\nforeign assistance. Others may be induced to think, that I grudge the\r\nindustrious poor of Boston their scantlings of charity. I will issue\r\na brief in their favour. The opulent, be their political sentiments\r\nwhat they may, ought to relieve them from their sufferings, and those\r\nwho, by former donations, have been the innocent cause of protracting\r\ntheir sufferings, are under a tenfold obligation to assist them now;\r\nand at the same time to make the most explicit declarations, that\r\nthey did not intend to promote, nor ever will join in rebellion.\r\nGreat allowances are to be made for the crossings, windings, and\r\ntergiversations of a politician; he is a cunning animal, and as\r\ngovernment is said to be founded in opinion, his tricks may be a part\r\nof the _arcana imperii_. Had our politicians confined themselves\r\nwithin any reasonable bounds, I never should have molested them;\r\nbut when I became satisfied, that many innocent, unsuspecting\r\npersons were in danger of being seduced to their utter ruin, and\r\nthe province of Massachusetts Bay in danger of being drenched with\r\nblood and carnage, I could restrain my emotions no longer; and\r\nhaving once broke the bands of natural reserve, was determined to\r\nprobe the sore to the bottom, though I was sure to touch the quick.\r\nIt is very foreign from my intentions to draw down the vengeance of\r\nGreat Britain upon the whigs; they are too valuable a part of the\r\ncommunity to lose, if they will permit themselves to be saved. I wish\r\nnothing worse to the highest of them, than that they may be deprived\r\nof their influence, till such time as they shall have changed their\r\nsentiments, principles, and measures.\r\n\r\nSedition has already been marked through its zigzag path to the\r\npresent times. When the statute for regulating the government\r\narrived, a match was put to the train, and the mine, that had\r\nbeen long forming, sprung, and threw the whole province into\r\nconfusion and anarchy. The occurrencies of the summer and autumn\r\npast are so recent and notorious, that a particular detail of them\r\nis unnecessary. Suffice it to say, that every barrier that civil\r\ngovernment had erected for the security of property, liberty and\r\nlife, was broken down, and law, constitution and government trampled\r\nunder foot by the rudest invaders. I shall not dwell upon these harsh\r\nnotes much longer. I shall yet become an advocate for the leading\r\nwhigs; much must be allowed to men, in their situation, forcibly\r\nactuated by the chagrin of disappointment, the fear of punishment,\r\nand the fascination of hope at the same time.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the whole story of empire does not furnish another instance\r\nof a forcible opposition to government, with so much apparent and\r\nlittle real cause, with such apparent probability without any\r\npossibility of success. The stamp-act gave the alarm. The instability\r\nof the public councils from the Greenvillian administration to the\r\nappointment of the Earl of Hillsborough to the American department,\r\nafforded as great a prospect of success, as the heavy duties imposed\r\nby the stamp-act, did a colour for the opposition. It was necessary\r\nto give the history of this matter in its course, offend who it\r\nwould, because those acts of government, that are called the greatest\r\ngrievances, became proper and necessary, through the misconduct of\r\nour politicians, and the justice of Great Britain towards us, could\r\nnot be made apparent without first pointing out that. I intend to\r\nconsider the acts of the British government, which are held up as the\r\nprincipal grievances, and inquire whether Great Britain is chargeable\r\nwith injustice in any one of them; but must first ask your attention\r\nto the authority of parliament. I suspect many of our politicians are\r\nwrong in their first principle, in denying that the constitutional\r\nauthority of parliament extends to the colonies; if so, it must not\r\nbe wondered at, that their whole fabric is so ruinous. I shall not\r\ntravel through all the arguments that have been adduced, for and\r\nagainst this question, but attempt to reduce the substance of them to\r\na narrow compass, after having taken a cursory view of the British\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\nThe security of the people from internal rapacity and violence, and\r\nfrom foreign invasion, is the end and design of government. The\r\nsimple forms of government are monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy;\r\nthat is, where the authority of the state is vested in one, a few,\r\nor the many. Each of these species of government has advantages\r\npeculiar to itself, and would answer the ends of government, were the\r\npersons intrusted with the authority of the state, always guided,\r\nthemselves, by unerring wisdom and public virtue; but rulers are not\r\nalways exempt from the weakness and depravity which make government\r\nnecessary to society. Thus monarchy is apt to rush headlong into\r\ntyranny, aristocracy to beget faction, and multiplied usurpation,\r\nand democracy, to degenerate into tumult, violence, and anarchy. A\r\ngovernment formed upon these three principles, in due proportion,\r\nis the best calculated to answer the ends of government, and to\r\nendure. Such a government is the British constitution, consisting\r\nof king, lords and commons, which at once includes the principal\r\nexcellencies, and excludes the principal defects of the other kinds\r\nof government. It is allowed, both by Englishmen and foreigners, to\r\nbe the most perfect system that the wisdom of ages has produced. The\r\ndistributions of power are so just, and the proportions so exact, as\r\nat once to support and controul each other. An Englishman glories in\r\nbeing subject to, and protected by such a government. The colonies\r\nare a part of the British empire. The best writers upon the law of\r\nnations tell us, that when a nation takes possession of a distant\r\ncountry, and settles there, that country, though separated from the\r\nprincipal establishment, or mother country, naturally becomes a\r\npart of the state, equal with its ancient possessions. Two supreme\r\nor independent authorities cannot exist in the same state. It would\r\nbe what is called _imperium in imperio_, the height of political\r\nabsurdity. The analogy between the political and human body is great.\r\nTwo independent authorities in a state would be like two distinct\r\nprinciples of volition and action in the human body, dissenting,\r\nopposing, and destroying each other. If, then, we are a part of the\r\nBritish empire, we must be subject to the supreme power of the state,\r\nwhich is vested in the estates of parliament, notwithstanding each\r\nof the colonies have legislative and executive powers of their own,\r\ndelegated, or granted to them for the purposes of regulating their\r\nown internal police, which are subordinate to, and must necessarily\r\nbe subject to the checks, controul, and regulation of the supreme\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\nThis doctrine is not new, but the denial of it is. It is beyond\r\na doubt, that it was the sense both of the parent country, and\r\nour ancestors, that they were to remain subject to parliament. It\r\nis evident from the charter itself; and this authority has been\r\nexercised by parliament, from time to time, almost ever since the\r\nfirst settlement of the country, and has been expressly acknowledged\r\nby our provincial legislatures. It is not less our interest, than our\r\nduty, to continue subject to the authority of parliament, which will\r\nbe more fully considered hereafter. The principal argument against\r\nthe authority of parliament, is this; the Americans are entitled\r\nto all the privileges of an Englishman; it is the privilege of an\r\nEnglishman to be exempt from all laws, that he does not consent to\r\nin person, or by representative. The Americans are not represented\r\nin parliament, and therefore are exempt from acts of parliament, or\r\nin other words, not subject to its authority. This appears specious;\r\nbut leads to such absurdities as demonstrate its fallacy. If the\r\ncolonies are not subject to the authority of parliament, Great\r\nBritain and the colonies must be distinct states, as completely\r\nso, as England and Scotland were before the union, or as Great\r\nBritain and Hanover are now. The colonies in that case will owe\r\nno allegiance to the imperial crown, and perhaps not to the person\r\nof the king, as the title to the crown is derived from an act of\r\nparliament, made since the settlement of this province, which act\r\nrespects the imperial crown only. Let us wave this difficulty, and\r\nsuppose allegiance due from the colonies to the person of the king of\r\nGreat Britain. He then appears in a new capacity, of king of America,\r\nor rather in several new capacities, of king of Massachusetts, king\r\nof Rhode-Island, king of Connecticut, &c. &c. For if our connexion\r\nwith Great Britain by the parliament be dissolved, we shall have\r\nnone among ourselves, but each colony become as distinct from the\r\nothers, as England was from Scotland, before the union. Some have\r\nsupposed that each state, having one and the same person for its\r\nking, is a sufficient connection. Were he an absolute monarch, it\r\nmight be; but in a mixed government, it is no union at all. For as\r\nthe king must govern each state, by its parliament, those several\r\nparliaments would pursue the particular interest of its own state;\r\nand however well disposed the king might be to pursue a line of\r\ninterest, that was common to all, the checks and controul that he\r\nwould meet with, would render it impossible. If the king of Great\r\nBritain has really these new capacities, they ought to be added to\r\nhis titles; and another difficulty will arise, the prerogatives\r\nof these new crowns have never been defined or limited. Is the\r\nmonarchical part of the several provincial constitutions to be nearer\r\nor more remote from absolute monarchy, in an inverted ratio to each\r\none's approaching to, or receding from a republic? But let us suppose\r\nthe same prerogatives inherent in the several American crowns, as\r\nare in the imperial crown of Great Britain, where shall we find the\r\nBritish constitution, that we all agree we are entitled to? We shall\r\nseek for it in vain in our provincial assemblies. They are but faint\r\nsketches of the estates of parliament. The houses of representatives,\r\nor Burgesses, have not all the powers of the house of commons; in\r\nthe charter governments they have no more than what is expressly\r\ngranted by their several charters. The first charters granted to\r\nthis province did not empower the assembly to tax the people at all.\r\nOur council boards are as destitute of the constitutional authority\r\nof the house of lords, as their several members are of the noble\r\nindependence, and splendid appendages of peerage. The house of peers\r\nis the bulwark of the British constitution, and through successive\r\nages, has withstood the shocks of monarchy, and the sappings of\r\ndemocracy, and the constitution gained strength by the conflict.\r\nThus the supposition of our being independent states, or exempt from\r\nthe authority of parliament, destroys the very idea of our having\r\na British constitution. The provincial constitutions, considered\r\nas subordinate, are generally well adapted to those purposes of\r\ngovernment, for which they were intended; that is, to regulate the\r\ninternal police of the several colonies; but have no principle of\r\nstability within themselves; they may support themselves in moderate\r\ntimes, but would be merged by the violence of turbulent ones, and the\r\nseveral colonies become wholly monarchical, or wholly republican,\r\nwere it not for the checks, controuls, regulations, and supports\r\nof the supreme authority of the empire. Thus the argument, that is\r\ndrawn from their first principle of our being entitled to English\r\nliberties, destroys the principle itself, it deprives us of the bill\r\nof rights, and all the benefits resulting from the revolution of\r\nEnglish laws, and of the British constitution.\r\n\r\nOur patriots have been so intent upon building up American rights,\r\nthat they have overlooked the rights of Great Britain, and our own\r\ninterest. Instead of proving that we were entitled to privileges,\r\nthat our fathers knew our situation would not admit us to enjoy, they\r\nhave been arguing away our most essential rights. If there be any\r\ngrievance, it does not consist in our being subject to the authority\r\nof parliament, but in our not having an actual representation in it.\r\nWere it possible for the colonies to have an equal representation in\r\nparliament, and were refused it upon proper application, I confess I\r\nshould think it a grievance; but at present it seems to be allowed,\r\nby all parties, to be impracticable, considering the colonies are\r\ndistant from Great Britain a thousand transmarine leagues. If that\r\nbe the case, the right or privilege, that we complain of being\r\ndeprived of, is not withheld by Britain, but the first principles of\r\ngovernment, and the immutable laws of nature, render it impossible\r\nfor us to enjoy it. This is apparently the meaning of that celebrated\r\npassage in Governor Hutchinson's letter, that rang through the\r\ncontinent, viz: There must be an abridgment of what is called English\r\nliberties. He subjoins, that he had never yet seen the projection,\r\nwhereby a colony, three thousand miles distant from the parent state,\r\nmight enjoy all the privileges of the parent state, and remain\r\nsubject to it, or in words to that effect. The obnoxious sentence,\r\ntaken detached from the letter, appears very unfriendly to the\r\ncolonies; but considered in connection with the other parts of the\r\nletter, is but a necessary result from our situation. Allegiance and\r\nprotection are reciprocal. It is our highest interest to continue a\r\npart of the British empire; and equally our duty to remain subject to\r\nthe authority of parliament. Our own internal police may generally be\r\nregulated by our provincial legislatures, but in national concerns,\r\nor where our own assemblies do not answer the ends of government\r\nwith respect to ourselves, the ordinances or interposition of the\r\ngreat council of the nation is necessary. In this case, the major\r\nmust rule the minor. After many more centuries shall have rolled\r\naway, long after we, who are now bustling upon the stage of life,\r\nshall have been received to the bosom of mother earth, and our names\r\nare forgotten, the colonies may be so far increased as to have the\r\nbalance of wealth, numbers and power, in their favour, the good of\r\nthe empire make it necessary to fix the seat of government here; and\r\nsome future George, equally the friend of mankind, with him that now\r\nsways the British sceptre, may cross the Atlantic, and rule Great\r\nBritain, by an American parliament.\r\n\r\nMASSACHUSETTENSIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESSED\r\n\r\n_To the Inhabitants of the Province of Massachusetts Bay_,\r\n\r\nJanuary 16, 1775.\r\n\r\n\r\nMY DEAR COUNTRYMEN,\r\n\r\nHad a person, some fifteen years ago, undertaken to prove that the\r\ncolonies were a part of the British empire or dominion, and as\r\nsuch, subject to the authority of the British parliament, he would\r\nhave acted as ridiculous a part, as to have undertaken to prove a\r\nself-evident proposition. Had any person denied it, he would have\r\nbeen called a fool or madman. At this wise period, individuals and\r\nbodies of men deny it, notwithstanding in doing it they subvert the\r\nfundamentals of government, deprive us of British liberties, and\r\nbuild up absolute monarchy in the colonies; for our charters suppose\r\nregal authority in the grantor; if that authority be derived from the\r\nBritish crown, it pre-supposes this territory to have been a part of\r\nthe British dominion, and as such subject to the imperial sovereign;\r\nif that authority was vested in the person of the king, in a\r\ndifferent capacity, the British constitution and laws are out of the\r\nquestion, and the king must be absolute as to us, as his prerogatives\r\nhave never been circumscribed. Such must have been the sovereign\r\nauthority of the several kings, who have granted American charters,\r\nprevious to the several grants; there is nothing to detract from it,\r\nat this time, in those colonies that are destitute of charters, and\r\nthe charter governments must severally revert to absolute monarchy,\r\nas their charters may happen to be forfeited by the grantees not\r\nfulfilling the conditions of them, as every charter contains an\r\nexpress or implied condition.\r\n\r\nIt is curious indeed to trace the denial and oppugnation to the\r\nsupreme authority of the state. When the stamp-act was made, the\r\nauthority of parliament to impose internal taxes was denied; but\r\ntheir right to impose external ones, or in other words, to lay duties\r\nupon goods and merchandize was admitted. When the act was made\r\nimposing duties upon tea, &c. a new distinction was set up, that\r\nthe parliament had a right to lay duties upon merchandize for the\r\npurpose of regulating trade, but not for the purpose of raising a\r\nrevenue: that is, the parliament had good right and lawful authority\r\nto lay the former duty of a shilling on the pound, but had none\r\nto lay the present duty of three pence. Having got thus far safe,\r\nit was only taking one step more to extricate ourselves entirely\r\nfrom their fangs, and become independant states, that our patriots\r\nmost heroically resolved upon, and flatly denied that parliament\r\nhad a right to make any laws whatever, that should be binding\r\nupon the colonies. There is no possible medium between absolute\r\nindependence, and subjection to the authority of parliament. He must\r\nbe blind indeed that cannot see our dearest interest in the latter,\r\nnotwithstanding many pant after the former. Misguided men! could they\r\nonce overtake their wish, they would be convinced of the madness of\r\nthe pursuit.\r\n\r\nMy dear countrymen, it is of the last importance that we settle this\r\npoint clearly in our minds; it will serve as a sure test, certain\r\ncriterion and invariable standard to distinguish the friends from\r\nthe enemies of our country, patriotism from sedition, loyalty from\r\nrebellion. To deny the supreme authority of the state, is a high\r\nmisdemeanor, to say no worse of it; to oppose it by force is an\r\novert act of treason, punishable by confiscation of estate, and\r\nmost ignominious death. The realm of England is an appropriate term\r\nfor the ancient realm of England, in contradistinction to Wales\r\nand other territories, that have been annexed to it. These as they\r\nhave been severally annexed to the crown, whether by conquest or\r\notherwise, became a part of the empire, and subject to the authority\r\nof parliament, whether they send members to parliament or not, and\r\nwhether they have legislative powers of their own or not.\r\n\r\nThus Ireland, who has perhaps the greatest possible subordinate\r\nlegislature, and sends no members to the British parliament, is bound\r\nby its acts, when expressly named. Guernsey and Jersey are no part\r\nof the realm of England, nor are they represented in parliament,\r\nbut are subject to its authority: and, in the same predicament are\r\nthe American colonies, and all the other dispersions of the empire.\r\nPermit me to request your attention to this subject a little longer;\r\nI assure you it is as interesting and important, as it is dry and\r\nunentertaining.\r\n\r\nLet us now recur to the first charter of this province, and we shall\r\nfind irresistible evidence, that our being part of the empire,\r\nsubject to the supreme authority of the state, bound by its laws\r\nand entitled to its protection, were the very terms and conditions\r\nby which our ancestors held their lands, and settled the province.\r\nOur charter, like all other American charters, are under the great\r\nseal of England; the grants are made by the king, for his heirs and\r\n_successors_; the several tenures to be of the king, his heirs and\r\n_successors_; in like manner are the reservations. It is apparent\r\nthe king acted in his royal capacity, as king of England, which\r\nnecessarily supposes the territory granted, to be a part of the\r\nEnglish dominions, holden of the crown of England.\r\n\r\nThe charter, after reciting several grants of the territory to\r\nsir Henry Roswell and others, proceeds to incorporation in these\r\nwords: \"And for as much as the good and prosperous success of the\r\nplantations of the said parts of New England aforesaid, intended\r\nby the said sir Henry Roswell and others, to be speedily set upon,\r\ncannot but chiefly depend, next under the blessing of almighty God,\r\nand the support of our royal authority, upon the good government\r\nof the same, to the end that the _affairs of business_, which from\r\ntime to time shall happen and arise concerning the said lands and\r\nthe plantations of the same may be the better managed and ordered,\r\nwe have further hereby, of our especial grace, certain knowledge\r\nand mere motion given, granted and confirmed, and for us, our heirs\r\nand successors, do give, grant and confirm unto our said trusty and\r\nwell beloved subjects, sir Henry Roswell, &c. and all such others\r\nas shall hereafter be admitted and made free of _the company and\r\nsociety hereafter mentioned_, shall from time to time and at all\r\ntimes, forever hereafter, be by virtue of these presents, _one body\r\ncorporate, politic in fact and name by the name of the governor and\r\ncompany of the Massachusetts Bay, in New England_; and them by the\r\nname of the governor and company of the Massachusetts Bay, in New\r\nEngland, one body politic and corporate in deed, fact and name.\r\nWe do for us our heirs and successors make, ordain, constitute\r\nand confirm by these presents, and that by that name they shall\r\nhave perpetual succession, and that by that name they and their\r\nsuccessors shall be capable and enabled as well _to implead and to\r\nbe impleaded, and to prosecute, demand and answer and be answered\r\nunto all and singular suits, causes, quarrels and actions of what\r\nkind or nature soever; and also to have, take, possess, acquire and\r\npurchase, any lands, tenements and hereditaments, or any goods or\r\nchattels, the same to lease, grant, demise, aliene, bargain, sell\r\nand dispose of as our liege people of this our realm of England,\r\nor any other corporation or body politic of the same may do_.\" I\r\nwould beg leave to ask one simple question, whether this looks like\r\na distinct state or independent empire? Provision is then made for\r\nelecting a governor, deputy governor, and eighteen assistants. After\r\nwhich, is this clause: \"We do for us, our heirs and successors, give\r\nand grant to the said governor and company, and their successors,\r\nthat the governor or in his absense the deputy governor of the said\r\ncompany, for the time being, and such of the assistants or freemen\r\nof the said company as shall be present, or the greater number of\r\nthem so assembled, whereof the governor or deputy governor and six\r\nof the assistants, at the least to be seven, shall have full power\r\nand authority to choose, nominate and appoint such and so many others\r\nas they shall think fit, and shall be willing to accept the same,\r\nto be free of the said company and body, and them into the same to\r\nadmit and to elect and constitute such officers as they shall think\r\nfit and requisite for the ordering, managing and dispatching of the\r\naffairs of the said governor and company and their successors, and\r\nto make _laws and ordinances for the good and welfare of the said\r\ncompany_, and for the government and ordering of the said lands and\r\nplantations, and the people inhabiting and to inhabit the same, as\r\nto them from time to time shall be thought meet: _So as such laws and\r\nordinances be not contrary or repugnant to the laws and statutes of\r\nthis our realm of England_.\"\r\n\r\nAnother clause is this, \"And for their further encouragement, of our\r\nespecial grace and favor, we do by these presents, for us, our heirs,\r\nand successors, yield and grant to the said governor and company\r\nand their successors, and every of them, their factors and assigns,\r\nthat they and every of them shall be free and quit from all taxes,\r\nsubsidies and customs in New England for the space of seven years,\r\nand from all taxes and impositions for the space of twenty-one years,\r\nupon all goods and merchandize, at any time or times hereafter,\r\neither upon importation thither, or exportation from thence into\r\nour realm of England, or into other of our dominions, by the said\r\ngovernor and company and their successors, their deputies, factors\r\nand assigns, &c.\"\r\n\r\nThe exemption from taxes for seven years in one case, and twenty one\r\nyears in the other, plainly indicates that after their expiration,\r\nthis province would be liable to taxation. Now I would ask by what\r\nauthority those taxes were to be imposed? It could not be by the\r\ngovernor and company, for no such power was delegated or granted to\r\nthem; and besides it would have been absurd and nugatory to exempt\r\nthem from their own taxation, supposing them to have had the power,\r\nfor they might have exempted themselves. It must therefore be by the\r\nking or parliament; it could not be by the king alone, for as king of\r\nEngland, the political capacity in which he granted the charter, he\r\nhad no such power, exclusive of the lords and commons, consequently\r\nit must have been by the parliament. This clause in the charter is as\r\nevident a recognition of the authority of the parliament over this\r\nprovince, as if the words, \"acts of parliament,\" had been inserted,\r\nas they were in the Pennsylvania charter. There was no session of\r\nparliament after the grant of our charter until the year 1640. In\r\n1642 the house of commons passed a resolve, \"that for the better\r\nadvancement of the plantations in New England, and the encouragement\r\nof the planters to proceed in their undertaking, their exports and\r\nimports should be freed and discharged from all customs, subsidies,\r\ntaxations and duties until the further order of the house;\" which was\r\ngratefully received and recorded in the archives of our predecessors.\r\nThis transaction shews very clearly in what sense our connection\r\nwith England was then understood. It is true, that in some arbitrary\r\nreigns, attempts were made by the servants of the crown to exclude\r\nthe two houses of parliament, from any share of the authority over\r\nthe colonies; they also attempted to render the king absolute in\r\nEngland; but the parliament always rescued the colonies, as well as\r\nEngland from such attempts.\r\n\r\nI shall recite but one more clause of this charter, which is this,\r\n\"And further our will and pleasure is, and we do hereby for us, our\r\nheirs and successors, ordain, declare and grant to the said governor\r\nand company, and their successors, that all and every of the subjects\r\nof us, our heirs and successors which shall go to and inhabit within\r\nthe said land and premises hereby mentioned to be granted, and every\r\nof their children which shall happen to be born there, or on the seas\r\nin going thither, or returning from thence, shall have and enjoy _all\r\nliberties and immunities of free and natural subjects, within any\r\nof the dominions_ of us, our heirs or successors, to all intents,\r\nconstructions and purposes whatsoever, as if they and every of them\r\nwere born within the realm of England.\" It is upon this, or a similar\r\nclause in the charter of William and Mary that our patriots have\r\nbuilt up the stupendous fabric of American independence. They argue\r\nfrom it a total exemption from parliamentary authority, because we\r\nare not represented in parliament.\r\n\r\nI have already shewn that the supposition of our being exempt\r\nfrom the authority of parliament, is pregnant with the grossest\r\nabsurdities. Let us now consider this clause in connection with the\r\nother parts of the charter. It is a rule of law, founded in reason\r\nand common sense, to construe each part of an instrument, so as\r\nthe whole may hang together, and be consistent with itself. If we\r\nsuppose this clause to exempt us from the authority of parliament,\r\nwe must throw away all the rest of the charter, for every other\r\npart indicates the contrary, as plainly as words can do it; and\r\nwhat is still worse, this clause becomes _felo de se_, and destroys\r\nitself; for if we are not annexed to the crown, we are aliens,\r\nand no charter, grant, or other act of the crown can naturalize\r\nus or entitle us to the liberties and immunities of Englishmen.\r\nIt can be done only by act of parliament. An alien is one born in\r\na strange country out of the allegiance of the king, and is under\r\nmany disabilities though residing in the realm; as Wales, Jersey,\r\nGuernsey, Ireland, the foreign plantations, &c. were severally\r\nannexed to the crown, they became parts of one and the same empire,\r\nthe natives of which are equally free as though they had been born\r\nin that territory which was the ancient realm. As our patriots\r\ndepend upon this clause, detached from the charter, let us view\r\nit in that light. If a person born in England removes to Ireland\r\nand settles there, he is then no longer represented in the British\r\nparliament, but he and his posterity are, and will ever be subject\r\nto the authority of the British parliament. If he removes to Jersey,\r\nGuernsey, or any other parts of the British dominions that send no\r\nmembers to parliament, he will still be in the same predicament.\r\nSo that the inhabitants of the American colonies do in fact enjoy\r\nall the liberties and immunities of natural born subjects. We are\r\nentitled to no greater privileges than those that are born within\r\nthe realm; and they can enjoy no other than we do, when they reside\r\nout of it. Thus, it is evident that this clause amounts to no more\r\nthan the royal assurance, that we are a part of the British empire;\r\nare not aliens, but natural born subjects; and as such, bound to\r\nobey the supreme power of the state, and entitled to protection from\r\nit. To avoid prolixity, I shall not remark particularly upon other\r\nparts of this charter, but observe in general, that whoever reads it\r\nwith attention, will meet with irresistible evidence in every part\r\nof it, that our being a part of the English dominions, subject to\r\nthe English crown, and within the jurisdiction of parliament, were\r\nthe terms upon which our ancestors settled this colony, and the very\r\ntenures by which they held their estates.\r\n\r\nNo lands within the British dominions are perfectly allodial; they\r\nare held mediately or immediately of the king, and upon forfeiture,\r\nrevert to the crown. My dear countrymen, you have many of you\r\nbeen most falsely and wickedly told by our patriots, that Great\r\nBritain was meditating a land tax, and seeking to deprive us of our\r\ninheritance; but had all the malice and subtilty of men and devils\r\nbeen united, a readier method to effect it could not have been\r\ndevised, than the late denials of the authority of parliament, and\r\nforcible oppositions to its acts. Yet, this has been planned and\r\nexecuted chiefly by persons of desperate fortunes.\r\n\r\nMASSACHUSETTENSIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESSED\r\n\r\n_To the Inhabitants of the Province of Massachusetts Bay_,\r\n\r\nJanuary 23, 1775.\r\n\r\n\r\nMY DEAR COUNTRYMEN,\r\n\r\nIf we carry our researches further back than the emigration of\r\nour ancestors, we shall find many things that reflect light upon\r\nthe object we are in quest of. It is immaterial when America was\r\nfirst discovered or taken possession of by the English. In 1602 one\r\nGosnold landed upon one of the islands, called Elizabeth islands,\r\nwhich were so named in honor of queen Elizabeth, built a fort, and\r\nprojected a settlement; his men were discouraged, and the project\r\nfailed. In 1606, king James granted all the continent from 34 to\r\n45 degrees, which he divided into two colonies, viz. the southern\r\nor Virginia, to certain merchants at London, the northern or New\r\nEngland, to certain merchants at Plymouth in England. In 1607,\r\nsome of the patentees of the northern colony began a settlement at\r\nSogadahoc; but the emigrants were disheartened after the trial of\r\none winter, and that attempt failed of success. Thus this territory\r\nhad not only been granted by the crown for purposes of colonization,\r\nwhich are to enlarge the empire or dominion of the parent state,\r\nand to open new sources of national wealth; but actual possession\r\nhad been taken by the grantees, previous to the emigration of our\r\nancestors, or any grant to them. In 1620, a patent was granted to the\r\nadventurers for the northern colony, incorporating them by the name\r\nof _the council for the affairs of New Plymouth_. From this company\r\nof merchants in England, our ancestors derived their title to this\r\nterritory. The tract of land called Massachusetts, was purchased\r\nof this company, by sir Henry Roswell and associates; their deed\r\nbears date March 19th, 1627. In 1628 they obtained a charter of\r\nincorporation, which I have already remarked upon. The liberties,\r\nprivileges and franchises, granted by this charter, do not perhaps\r\nexceed those granted to the city of London and other corporations\r\nwithin the realm. The legislative power was very confined; it did\r\nnot even extend to levying taxes of any kind; that power was however\r\nassumed under this charter, which by law worked a forfeiture; and\r\nfor this among other things, in the reign of Charles the second,\r\nthe charter was adjudged forfeited, and the franchises seized into\r\nthe king's hands. This judgment did not affect our ancestors' title\r\nto their lands, that were not derived originally from the charter,\r\nthough confirmed by it, but by purchase from the council at Plymouth,\r\nwho held immediately under the crown. Besides, our ancestors had\r\nnow reduced what before was a naked right to possession, and by\r\npersevering through unequalled toils, hardships and dangers, at the\r\napproach of which other emigrants had fainted, rendered New England\r\na very valuable acquisition both to the crown and nation. This was\r\nhighly meritorious, and ought not to be overlooked in adjusting the\r\npresent unhappy dispute; but our patriots would deprive us of all\r\nthe merit, both to the crown and nation, by severing us from both.\r\nAfter the revolution, our ancestors petitioned the parliament to\r\nrestore the charter. A bill for that purpose passed the house of\r\ncommons, but went no further. In consequence of another petition,\r\nking William and queen Mary granted our present charter, for uniting\r\nand incorporating the Massachusetts, New Plymouth, and several other\r\nterritories into one province. More extensive powers of legislation,\r\nthan those contained in the first charter, were become necessary, and\r\nwere granted; and the form of the legislature made to approach nearer\r\nto the form of the supreme legislature. The powers of legislation\r\nare confined to local or provincial purposes and further restricted\r\nby these words, viz. _So as the same be not repugnant or contrary\r\nto the laws of this our realm of England._ Our patriots have made\r\nmany nice distinctions and curious refinements, to evade the force\r\nof these words; but after all, it is impossible to reconcile them to\r\nthe idea of an independent state, as it is to reconcile disability to\r\nomnipotence. The provincial power of taxation is also restricted to\r\nprovincial purposes, and allowed to be exercised over such only as\r\nare inhabitants or proprietors within the province. I would observe\r\nhere, that the granting subordinate powers of legislation, does not\r\nabridge or diminish the powers of the higher legislatures; thus we\r\nsee corporations in England and the several towns in this province\r\nvested with greater or lesser powers of legislation, without the\r\nparliament, in one case, or the general court in the other, being\r\nrestrained, from enacting those very laws, that fall within the\r\njurisdiction of the several corporations. Had our present charter\r\nbeen conceived in such equivocal terms, as that it might be construed\r\nas restraining the authority of parliament, the uniform usage ever\r\nsince it passed the seal, would satisfy us that its intent was\r\ndifferent. The parliament, in the reign when it was granted, long\r\nbefore and in every reign since, has been making statutes to extend\r\nto the colonies, and those statutes have been as uniformly submitted\r\nto as authoritative, by the colonies, till within ten or a dozen\r\nyears. Sometimes acts of parliament have been made, and sometimes\r\nhave been repealed in consequence of petitions from the colonies. The\r\nprovincial assemblies often refer to acts of parliament in their own,\r\nand have sometimes made acts to aid their execution. It is evident\r\nthat it was the intention of their majesties, to grant subordinate\r\npowers of legislation, without impairing or diminishing the authority\r\nof the supreme legislature. Had there been any words in the charter,\r\nthat precluded that construction, or did the whole taken together\r\ncontradict it, lawyers would tell us, that the king was deceived in\r\nhis grant, and the patentees took no estate by it, because the crown\r\ncan neither alienate a part of the British dominions, nor impair the\r\nsupreme power of the empire. I have dwelt longer on this subject,\r\nthan I at first intended, and not by any means done it justice, as\r\nto avoid prolix narratives and tedious deduction, I have omitted\r\nperhaps more than I have adduced, that evinces the truth of the\r\nposition, that we are a part of the British dominions, and subject\r\nto the authority of parliament. The novelty of the contrary tenets,\r\nwill appear by extracting a part of a pamphlet, published in 1764, by\r\na Boston gentleman, who was then the oracle of the whigs, and whose\r\nprofound knowledge in the law and constitution is equalled but by few.\r\n\r\n\"I also lay it down as one of the first principles from whence I\r\nintend to deduce the civil rights of the British colonies, that all\r\nof them are subject to, and dependent on Great Britain; and that\r\ntherefore as over subordinate governments, the parliament of Great\r\nBritain has an undoubted power and lawful authority to make acts for\r\nthe general good, that by naming them, shall and ought to be equally\r\nbinding, as upon the subjects of Great Britain within the realm.\r\nIs there the least difference, as to the consent of the colonists,\r\nwhether taxes and impositions are laid on their trade, and other\r\nproperty by the crown alone, or by the parliament? As it is agreed\r\non all hands, the crown alone cannot impose them, we should be\r\njustifiable in refusing to pay them, _but must and ought to yield\r\nobedience to an act of parliament, though erroneous, till repealed_.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a maxim, that the king can do no wrong; and every good subject\r\nis bound to believe his king is not inclined to do any. We are\r\nblessed with a prince who has given abundant demonstrations, that\r\nin all his actions, he studies the good of his people, and the true\r\nglory of his crown, which are inseperable. It would therefore be the\r\nhighest degree of impudence and disloyalty, to imagine that the king,\r\nat the head of his parliament, could have any but the most pure and\r\nperfect intentions of justice, goodness and truth, that human nature\r\nis capable of. All this I say and believe of the king and parliament,\r\nin all their acts; even in that which so nearly affects the interests\r\nof the colonists; and that a most perfect and ready obedience is to\r\nbe yielded to it while it remains in force. The power of parliament\r\nis uncontroulable but by themselves, and we must obey. They only can\r\nrepeal their own acts. There would be an end of all government, if\r\none or a number of subjects, or subordinate provinces should take\r\nupon them so far to judge of the justice of an act of parliament,\r\nas to refuse obedience to it. If there was nothing else to restrain\r\nsuch a step, prudence ought to do it, for forcibly resisting the\r\nparliament and the king's laws is high treason. Therefore let the\r\nparliament lay what burdens they please on us, we must, it is our\r\nduty to submit and patiently bear them, till they will be pleased to\r\nrelieve us.\"\r\n\r\nThe Pennsylvania Farmer, who took the lead in explaining away the\r\nright of parliament to raise a revenue in America, speaking of\r\nregulating trade, tells us, that \"he who considers these provinces\r\nas states distinct from the British empire, has very slender notions\r\nof justice, or of their interest; we are but parts of a whole, and\r\ntherefore there must exist a power somewhere to preside, and preserve\r\nthe connection in due order. This power is lodged in parliament,\r\nand we are as much dependant on Great Britain as a perfectly free\r\npeople can be on another.\" He supposes that we are dependant in some\r\nconsiderable degree upon Great Britain; and that that dependance is\r\nnevertheless consistent with perfect freedom.\r\n\r\nHaving settled this point, let us reflect upon the resolves and\r\nproceedings of our patriots. We often read resolves denying the\r\nauthority of parliament, which is the imperial sovereign, gilded over\r\nwith professions of loyalty to the king, but the golden leaf is too\r\nthin to conceal the treason. It either argues profound ignorance or\r\nhypocritical cunning.\r\n\r\nWe find many unsuspecting persons prevailed on openly to oppose the\r\nexecution of acts of parliament with force and arms. My friends, some\r\nof the persons that beguiled you, could have turned to the chapter,\r\npage and section, where such insurrections are pronounced rebellion,\r\nby the law of the land; and had not their hearts been dead to a sense\r\nof justice, and steeled against every feeling of humanity, they would\r\nhave timely warned you of your danger. Our patriots have sent us in\r\npursuit of a mere _ignis fatuus_, a fascinating glare devoid of\r\nsubstance; and now when we find ourselves bewildered, with scarce one\r\nray of hope to raise our sinking spirits, or stay our fainting souls,\r\nthey conjure up phantoms more delusive and fleeting, if possible,\r\nthan that which first led us astray. They tell us, we are a match\r\nfor Great Britain. The twentieth part of the strength that Great\r\nBritain could exert, were it necessary, is more than sufficient to\r\ncrush this defenceless province to atoms, notwithstanding all the\r\nvapouring of the disaffected here and elsewhere. They tell us the\r\narmy is disaffected to the service. What pains have our wretched\r\npoliticians not taken to attach them to it? The officers conceive\r\nno very favourable opinion of the cause of the whigs, from the\r\nobloquy with which their General hath been treated, in return for his\r\nhumanity, nor from the infamous attempts to seduce the soldiers from\r\nhis majesty's service. The policy of some of our patriots has been as\r\nweak and contemptible, as their motives are sordid and malevolent;\r\nfor when they found their success, in corrupting the soldiery, did\r\nnot answer their expectations, they took pains to attach them firmer\r\nto the cause they adhered to, by preventing the erecting of barracks\r\nfor their winter quarters, by which means many contracted diseases,\r\nand some lives were lost, from the unwholesome buildings they were\r\nobliged to occupy; and, as though some stimulus was still wanting,\r\nsome provocation to prevent human nature revolting in the hour of\r\nbattle, they deprived the soldiers of a gratification never denied to\r\nthe brute creation; straw to lie on. I do not mention this conduct to\r\nraise the resentment of the troops; it has had its effect already;\r\nand it is proper you should know it; nor should I have blotted paper\r\nin relating facts so mortifying to the pride of man, had it not\r\nbeen basely suggested that there would be a defection should the\r\narmy take the field. Those are matters of small moment, compared to\r\nanother, which is the cause they are engaged in. It is no longer\r\na struggle between whigs and tories, whether these or those shall\r\noccupy posts of honour, or enjoy the emoluments of office, nor is it\r\nnow whether this or the other act of parliament shall be repealed.\r\nThe army is sent here to decide a question, intimately connected\r\nwith the honour and interest of the nation, no less than whether the\r\ncolonies shall continue a part of, or be for ever dismembered from\r\nthe British empire. It is a cause in which no honest American can\r\nwish our politicians success, though it is devoutly to be wished,\r\nthat their discomfiture may be effected without recourse being had to\r\nthe _ultima ratio_--the sword. This, our wretched situation, is but\r\nthe natural consequence of denying the authority of parliament, and\r\nforcibly opposing its acts.\r\n\r\nSometimes we are amused with intimations that Holland, France or\r\nSpain, will make a diversion in our favour. These, equally with the\r\nothers, are suggestions of despair. These powers have colonies of\r\ntheir own, and might not choose to set a bad example, by encouraging\r\nthe colonies of any other state to revolt. The Dutch have too much\r\nmoney in the English funds, and are too much attached to their money\r\nto espouse our quarrel. The French and Spaniards have not yet forgot\r\nthe drubbing they received from Great Britain last war; and all three\r\nfear to offend that power which our politicians would persuade us to\r\ndespise.\r\n\r\nLastly, they tell us that the people in England will take our part,\r\nand prevent matters from coming to extremity. This is their fort,\r\nwhere, when driven from every other post, they fly for refuge.\r\n\r\nAlas, my friends! our congresses have stopped up every avenue that\r\nleads to that sanctuary. We hear, by every arrival from England,\r\nthat it is no longer a ministerial, (if it ever was) but a national\r\ncause. My dear countrymen, I deal plainly with you. I never should\r\nforgive myself if I did not. Are there not eleven regiments in\r\nBoston? A respectable fleet in the harbour? Men of war stationed at\r\nevery considerable port along the continent? Are there not three\r\nships of the line sent here, notwithstanding the danger of the winter\r\ncoast, with more than the usual complement of marines? Have not our\r\ncongresses, county, provincial, and continental, instead of making\r\nadvances for an accommodation, bid defiance to Great Britain? _He\r\nthat runs may read._\r\n\r\nIf our politicians will not be pursuaded from running against the\r\nthick bosses of the buckler, it is time for us to leave them to\r\ntheir fate, and provide for the safety of ourselves, our wives, our\r\nchildren, our friends, and our country.\r\n\r\nI have many things to add, but must now take my leave, for this\r\nweek, by submitting to your judgment whether there be not an\r\nabsolute necessity of immediately protesting against all traitorous\r\nresolves, leagues, and associations, of bodies of men, that appear\r\nto have acted in a representative capacity. Had our congresses been\r\naccidental or spontaneous meetings, the whole blame might have rested\r\nupon the individuals that composed them; but as they appear in the\r\ncharacter of the people's delegates, is there not the utmost danger\r\nof the innocent being confounded with the guilty, unless they take\r\ncare timely to distinguish themselves?\r\n\r\nMASSACHUSETTENSIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESSED\r\n\r\n_To the Inhabitants of the Province of Massachusetts Bay_,\r\n\r\nJanuary 30, 1775.\r\n\r\n\r\nMY DEAR COUNTRYMEN,\r\n\r\nAs the oppugnation to the king in parliament tends manifestly to\r\nindependence, and the colonies would soon arrive at that point, did\r\nnot Great Britain check them in their career; let us indulge the\r\nidea, however extravagant and romantic, and suppose ourselves for\r\never separated from the parent state. Let us suppose Great Britain\r\nsinking under the violence of the shock, and overwhelmed by her\r\nancient hereditary enemies; or what is more probable, opening new\r\nsources of national wealth, to supply the deficiency of that which\r\nused to flow to her through American channels, and perhaps planting\r\nmore loyal colonies in the new discovered regions of the south, still\r\nretaining her pre-eminence among the nations, though regardless of\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nLet us now advert to our own situation. Destitute of British\r\nprotection, that impervious barrier, behind which, in perfect\r\nsecurity, we have increased to a degree almost exceeding the bounds\r\nof probability, what other Britain could we look to when in distress?\r\nWhat succedaneum does the world afford to make good the loss? Would\r\nnot our trade, navigation, and fishery, which no nation dares violate\r\nor invade, when distinguished by British colours, become the sport\r\nand prey of the maritime powers of Europe? Would not our maritime\r\ntowns be exposed to the pillaging of every piratical enterprise?\r\nAre the colonies able to maintain a fleet, sufficient to afford\r\none idea of security to such an extensive sea-coast? Before they\r\ncan defend themselves against foreign invasions, they must unite\r\ninto one empire; otherwise the jarring interests, and opposite\r\npropensities, would render the many headed monster in politics,\r\nunwieldly and inactive. Neither the form or seat of government would\r\nbe readily agreed upon; more difficult still would it be to fix upon\r\nthe person or persons, to be invested with the imperial authority.\r\nThere is perhaps as great a diversity between the tempers and habits\r\nof the inhabitants of this province, and the tempers and habits of\r\nthe Carolinians, as there subsists between some different nations;\r\nnor need we travel so far; the Rhode-Islanders are as diverse from\r\nthe people of Connecticut, as those mentioned before. Most of the\r\ncolonies are rivals to each other in trade. Between others there\r\nsubsist deep animosities, respecting their boundaries, which have\r\nheretofore produced violent altercations, and the sword of civil war\r\nhas been more than once unsheathed, without bringing these disputes\r\nto a decision. It is apparent that so many discordant, heterogeneous\r\nparticles could not suddenly unite and consolidate into one body. It\r\nis most probable, that if they were ever united, the union would be\r\neffected by some aspiring genius, putting himself at the head of the\r\ncolonists' army (for we must suppose a very respectable one indeed,\r\nbefore we are severed from Britain) and taking advantage of the\r\nenfeebled, bleeding, and distracted state of the colonies, subjugate\r\nthe whole to the yoke of despotism. Human nature is every where the\r\nsame; and this has often been the issue of those rebellions, that the\r\nrightful prince was unable to subdue. We need not travel through the\r\nstates of ancient Greece and Rome, or the more modern ones in Europe,\r\nto pick up the instances, with which the way is strewed; we have a\r\nnotable one in our own. So odious and arbitrary was the protectorate\r\nof Cromwell, that when death had delivered them from the dread of\r\nthe tyrant, all parties conspired to restore monarchy; and each one\r\nstrove to be the foremost in inviting home, and placing upon the\r\nimperial throne, their exiled prince, the son of the same Charles,\r\nwho, not many years before, had been murdered on a scaffold. The\r\nrepublicans themselves now rushed to the opposite extreme, and had\r\nCharles 2d. been as ambitious, as some of his predecessors were, he\r\nmight have established in England a power more arbitrary, than the\r\nfirst Charles ever had in contemplation.\r\n\r\nLet us now suppose the colonies united, and moulded into some form\r\nof government. Think one moment of the revenue necessary to support\r\nthis government, and to provide for even the appearance of defence.\r\nConceive yourselves in a manner exhausted by the conflict with Great\r\nBritain, now staggering and sinking under the load of your own taxes,\r\nand the weight of your own government. Consider further, that to\r\nrender government operative and salutary, subordination is necessary.\r\nThis our patriots need not be told of; and when once they had mounted\r\nthe steed, and found themselves so well seated as to run no risk\r\nof being thrown from the saddle, the severity of their discipline\r\nto restore subordination, would be in proportion to their former\r\ntreachery in destroying it. We have already seen specimens of their\r\ntyranny, in their inhuman treatment of persons guilty of no crime,\r\nexcept that of differing in sentiment from the whigs. What then must\r\nwe expect from such scourges of mankind, when supported by imperial\r\npower?\r\n\r\nTo elude the difficulty resulting from our defenceless situation,\r\nwe are told that the colonies would open a free trade with all the\r\nworld, and all nations would join in protecting their common mart.\r\nA very little reflection will convince us that this is chimerical.\r\nAmerican trade, however beneficial to Great Britain, while she can\r\ncommand it, would be but as a drop of the bucket, or the light dust\r\nof the balance, to all the commercial states of Europe. Besides,\r\nwere British fleets and armies no longer destined to our protection,\r\nin a very short time, France and Spain would recover possession of\r\nthose territories, that were torn, reluctant and bleeding from them,\r\nin the last war, by the superior strength of Britain. Our enemies\r\nwould again extend their line of fortification, from the northern to\r\nthe southern shore; and by means of our late settlements stretching\r\nthemselves to the confines of Canada, and the communications opened\r\nfrom one country to the other, we should be exposed to perpetual\r\nincursions from Canadians and savages. But our distress would not\r\nend here; for when once these incursions should be supported by the\r\nformidable armaments of France and Spain, the whole continent would\r\nbecome their easy prey, and would be parcelled out, Poland like.\r\nRecollect the consternation we were thrown into last war, when Fort\r\nWilliam Henry was taken by the French. It was apprehended that all\r\nNew England would be overrun by their conquering arms. It was even\r\nproposed, for our own people to burn and lay waste all the country\r\nwest of Connecticut river, to impede the enemies march, and prevent\r\ntheir ravaging the country east of it. This proposal come from no\r\ninconsiderable man. Consider what must _really_ have been our fate,\r\nunaided by Britain last war.\r\n\r\nGreat Britain aside, what earthly power could stretch out the\r\ncompassionate arm to shield us from those powers, that have long\r\nbeheld us with the sharp, piercing eyes of avidity, and have\r\nheretofore bled freely, and expended their millions to obtain us? Do\r\nyou suppose their lust of empire is satiated? Or do you suppose they\r\nwould scorn to obtain so glorious a prize by an easy conquest? Or can\r\nany be so visionary or impious, as to believe that the Father of the\r\nUniverse will work miracles in favour of rebellion? And after having,\r\nby some unseen arm, and mighty power, destroyed Great Britain for\r\nus, will in the same mysterious way defend us against other European\r\npowers? Sometimes we are told, that the colonies may put themselves\r\nunder the protection of some one foreign state; but it ought to be\r\nconsidered, that to do that, we must throw ourselves into their\r\npower. We can make them no return for protection, but by trade; and\r\nof that they can have no assurance, unless we become subject to their\r\nlaws. This is evident by our contention with Britain.\r\n\r\nWhich state would you prefer being annexed to; France, Spain, or\r\nHolland? I suppose the latter, as it is a republic. But are you sure,\r\nthat the other powers of Europe would be idle spectators; content to\r\nsuffer the Dutch to engross the American colonies, or their trade?\r\nAnd what figure would the Dutch probably make in the unequal contest?\r\nTheir sword has been long since sheathed in commerce. Those of you\r\nthat have visited Surinam, and seen a Dutch governor dispensing at\r\ndiscretion his own opinions for law, would not suddenly exchange the\r\nEnglish for Dutch government.\r\n\r\nI will subjoin some observations from the Farmer's letters. \"When\r\nthe appeal is made to the sword, highly probable it is, that the\r\npunishment will exceed the offence, and the calamities attending on\r\nwar outweigh those preceding it. These considerations of justice and\r\nprudence, will always have great influence with good and wise men.\r\nTo these reflections it remains to be added, and ought forever to\r\nbe remembered, that resistance in the case of the colonies against\r\ntheir mother country, is extremely different from the resistance of\r\na people against their prince. A nation may change their king, or\r\nrace of kings, and retaining their ancient form of government, be\r\ngainers by changing. Thus Great Britain, under the illustrious house\r\nof Brunswick, a house that seems to flourish for the happiness of\r\nmankind, has found a felicity unknown in the reigns of the Stewarts.\r\nBut if once we are separated from our mother country, what new form\r\nof government shall we adopt, or where shall we find another Britain\r\nto supply our loss? Torn from the body, to which we are united by\r\nreligion, laws, affection, relation, language and commerce, we must\r\nbleed at every vein. In truth, the prosperity of these provinces is\r\nfounded in their dependance on Great Britain.\"\r\n\r\nMASSACHUSETTENSIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESSED\r\n\r\n_To the Inhabitants of the Province of Massachusetts Bay_,\r\n\r\nFebruary 6, 1775.\r\n\r\n\r\nMY DEAR COUNTRYMEN,\r\n\r\nWhen we reflect upon the constitutional connection between Great\r\nBritain and the colonies, view the reciprocation of interest,\r\nconsider that the welfare of Britain, in some measure, and the\r\nprosperity of America wholly depends upon that connection; it is\r\nastonishing, indeed, almost incredible, that one person should be\r\nfound on either side of the Atlantic, so base, and destitute of every\r\nsentiment of justice, as to attempt to destroy or weaken it. If there\r\nare none such, in the name of Almighty God, let me ask, wherefore is\r\nrebellion, that implacable fiend to society, suffered to rear its\r\nghastly front among us, blasting, with haggard look, each social joy,\r\nand embittering every hour?\r\n\r\nRebellion is the most atrocious offence, that can be perpetrated\r\nby man, save those which are committed more immediately against\r\nthe supreme Governor of the Universe, who is the avenger of his\r\nown cause. It dissolves the social band, annihilates the security\r\nresulting from law and government; introduces fraud, violence,\r\nrapine, murder, sacrilege, and the long train of evils, that riot,\r\nuncontrouled, in a state of nature. Allegiance and protection are\r\nreciprocal. The subject is bound by the compact to yield obedience to\r\ngovernment, and in return, is entitled to protection from it; thus\r\nthe poor are protected against the rich; the weak against the strong;\r\nthe individual against the many; and this protection is guaranteed\r\nto each member, by the whole community. But when government is laid\r\nprostrate, a state of war, of all against all commences; might\r\novercomes right; innocence itself has no security, unless the\r\nindividual sequesters himself from his fellowmen, inhabits his own\r\ncave, and seeks his own prey. This is what is called a state of\r\nnature. I once thought it chimerical.\r\n\r\nThe punishment inflicted upon rebels and traitors, in all states,\r\nbears some proportion to the aggravated crime. By our law, the\r\npunishment is, \"That the offender be drawn to the gallows, and not be\r\ncarried, or walk; that he be hanged by the neck, and then cut down\r\nalive; that his entrails be taken out and burned while he is yet\r\nalive; that his head be cut off; that his body be divided into four\r\nparts; that his head and quarters be at the king's disposal.\" The\r\nconsequences of attainder, are forfeiture and corruption of blood.\r\n\r\n\"Forfeiture is two-fold, of real and personal estate; by attainder\r\nin high treason a man forfeits to the king all his lands and\r\ntenements of inheritance, whether fee simple, or fee tail; and all\r\nhis rights of entry on lands and tenements, which he had at the\r\ntime of the offence committed, or at any time afterwards to be for\r\never vested in the crown. The forfeiture relates back to the time\r\nof the treason being committed, so as to avoid all intermediate\r\nsales and incumberances; even the dower of the wife is forfeited.\r\nThe natural justice of forfeiture, or confiscation of property, for\r\ntreason, is founded in this consideration, that he, who has thus\r\nviolated the fundamental principles of government, and broken his\r\npart of the original contract between king and people, hath abandoned\r\nhis connections with society; hath no longer any right to those\r\nadvantages, which before belonged to him purely as a member of the\r\ncommunity, among which social advantages the right of transferring\r\nor transmitting property to others, is one of the chief. Such\r\nforfeitures, moreover, whereby his posterity must suffer, as well as\r\nhimself, will help to restrain a man, not only by the sense of his\r\nduty and dread of personal punishment, but also by his passions and\r\nnatural affections; and will influence every dependant and relation\r\nhe has to keep him from offending.\" 4 Black. 374. 375.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable, however, that this offence, notwithstanding it is\r\nof a crimson colour, and the deepest dye, and its just punishment\r\nis not confined to the person of the offender, but beggars all his\r\nfamily, is sometimes committed by persons, who are not conscious of\r\nguilt. Sometimes they are ignorant of the law, and do not foresee\r\nthe evils they bring upon society; at others, they are induced to\r\nthink that their cause is founded in the eternal principles of\r\njustice and truth, that they are only making an appeal to heaven,\r\nand may justly expect its decree in their favour. Doubtless many of\r\nthe rebels, in the year 1745, were buoyed up with such sentiments,\r\nnevertheless they were cut down like grass before the scythe of the\r\nmower; the gibbet and scaffold received those that the sword, wearied\r\nwith destroying, had spared; and what loyalist shed one pitying\r\ntear over their graves? They were incorrigible rebels, and deserved\r\ntheir fate. The community is in less danger, when the disaffected\r\nattempt to excite a rebellion against the person of the prince, than\r\nwhen government itself is the object, because in the former case\r\nthe questions are few, simple, and their solutions obvious, the\r\nfatal consequences more apparent, and the loyal people more alert to\r\nsuppress it in embryo; whereas, in the latter, a hundred rights of\r\nthe people, inconsistent with government, and as many grievances,\r\ndestitute of foundation, the mere creatures of distempered brains,\r\nare pourtrayed in the liveliest colours, and serve as bugbears to\r\naffright from their duty, or as decoys to allure the ignorant, the\r\ncredulous and the unwary, to their destruction. Their suspicions are\r\ndrowned in the perpetual roar for liberty and country; and even the\r\nprofessions of allegiance to the person of the king, are improved as\r\nmeans to subvert his government.\r\n\r\nIn mentioning high treason in the course of these papers, I may not\r\nalways have expressed myself with the precision of a lawyer; they\r\nhave a language peculiar to themselves. I have examined their books,\r\nand beg leave to lay before you some further extracts, which deserve\r\nyour attention. To levy war against the king, was high treason by the\r\ncommon law, 3 inst. 9. This is also declared to be high treason by\r\nthe stat. of 25 Edw. 3. c. 2. and by the law of this province, 8 W.\r\n3. c. 5. Assembling in warlike array, against a statute, is levying\r\nwar against the king, 1 Hale 133. So to destroy any trade generally,\r\n146. Riding with banners displayed, or forming into companies; or\r\nbeing furnished with military officers; or armed with military\r\nweapons, as swords, guns, &c. any of these circumstances carries the\r\n_speciem belli_, and will support an indictment for high treason in\r\nlevying war, 150. An insurrection to raise the price of servants'\r\nwages was held to be an overt-act of this species of treason,\r\nbecause this was done _in defiance of the statute_ of labourers; it\r\nwas done in defiance of the _king's authority_, 5 Bac. 117 cites 3\r\ninst. 10. Every assembling of a number of men, in a warlike manner,\r\nwith a design to redress any _public grievance_, is likewise an\r\novert-act of this species of treason, because this being an attempt\r\nto do that by _private authority_, which only ought to be done by\r\nthe king's authority, is an invasion of the prerogative, 5 Bac. 117\r\ncites 3 inst. 9. Ha. p. c. 14. Kel. 71. Sid. 358. 1. Hawk. 37. Every\r\nassembling of a number of men in a warlike manner, with an intention\r\nto reform the government, or the law, is an overt-act of this species\r\nof treason, 5 Bac. 117. cites 3 inst. 9. 10. Poph. 122. Kel. 76. 7.\r\n1 Hawk. 37. Levying war may be by taking arms, not only to dethrone\r\nthe king, but under pretence to reform religion, or the laws, or\r\nto remove evil councellors, or other grievances, whether _real_ or\r\n_pretended_, 4 Black. 81. Foster 211. If any levy war to expulse\r\nstrangers; to deliver men out of prison; to remove councellors, or\r\nagainst any statute; or to any other end, pretending reformation of\r\ntheir own heads, without warrant, this is levying war against the\r\nking, because they take upon them royal authority, which is against\r\nthe king, 3 inst. 9. If three, four, or more, rise to pull down an\r\ninclosure, this is a riot; but if they had risen of purpose to alter\r\nreligion, established within the realm, or laws, or to go from town\r\nto town generally, and cast down inclosures, this is a levying of war\r\n(though there be no great number of conspirators) within the purview\r\nof this statute; because the pretence is public and general, and not\r\nprivate in particular, 3 inst. 9. Foster 211. If any, with strength\r\nand weapons, invasive and defensive, do hold and defend a castle or\r\nfort, against the king and his power, this is levying of war against\r\nthe king, 3 inst. 10. Foster 219. 1 Hale 149. 296.\r\n\r\nIt was resolved by all the judges of England in the reign of Henry\r\nthe 8th, that an insurrection against the statute of labourers, for\r\nthe enhancing of salaries and wages, was a levying of war against\r\nthe king, because it was generally against the _king's law_, and the\r\noffenders took upon them the reformation thereof, which subjects\r\nby gathering of power, ought not to do, 3 inst. 10. All risings in\r\norder to effect innovations of a _public_ and _general_ concern, by\r\nan armed force, are, in construction of law, high treason within the\r\nclause of levying war. For though they are not levelled at the person\r\nof the king, they are against his royal majesty. And besides, they\r\nhave a direct tendency to dissolve all the bonds of society, and to\r\ndestroy all property, and all government too, by numbers and an armed\r\nforce, Foster 211. In Benstead's case, Cro. car. 593. At a conference\r\nof all the justices and barons, it was resolved, that going to\r\nLambeth house, in warlike manner, to surprize the archbishop, who\r\nwas a privy counsellor (it being with drums and a multitude) to the\r\nnumber of three hundred persons, was treason; upon which Foster, page\r\n212, observes, that if it did appear by the libel, which he says was\r\npreviously posted up at the exchange, exhorting the apprentices to\r\nrise and sack the bishop's house, upon the Monday following, or by\r\nthe cry of the rabble, at Lambeth house, that the attempt was made\r\non account of measures _the king had taken, or was then taking at\r\nthe instigation, as they imagined, of the archbishop_, and that the\r\nrabble had _deliberately_ and upon a _public invitation_, attempted\r\nby _numbers_ and open force, to take a _severe revenge_ upon the\r\n_privy counsellor_ for the measures the sovereign had taken or was\r\npursuing, the _grounds and reasons_ of the resolutions would be\r\nsufficiently explained, without taking that _little_ circumstance\r\nof the _drum_ into the case. And he delivers as his opinion, page\r\n208, that no great stress can be laid on that distinction taken\r\nby Ld. C. J. Hale, between an insurrection with, and one without\r\nthe appearance of an army formed under leaders, and provided with\r\nmilitary weapons, and with drums, colours, &c. and says, the _want_\r\nof these circumstances weighed nothing with the court in the cases of\r\nDamaree and Purchase, but that it was supplied by the _number_ of the\r\ninsurgents. That they were provided with axes, crows, and such like\r\ntools, _furor arma ministrat_; and adds, page 208, the true criterion\r\nin all these cases, is, _quo animo_, did the parties assemble,\r\nwhether on account of some _private_ quarrel, or, page 211, to effect\r\ninnovations of a _public_ and _general_ concern, by an armed force.\r\nUpon the case of Damaree and Purchase, reported 8 stat. in. 218. to\r\n285. Judge Foster observes, page 215, that \"since the meeting houses\r\nof protestant dissenters are, by the _toleration act_ taken under\r\n_protection_ of the _law_, the insurrection in the present case,\r\nbeing to pull down all dissenting protestant meeting-houses, was to\r\nbe considered as a public declaration of the rabble _against that\r\nact_, and an attempt to render it _ineffectual_ by _numbers_ and open\r\nforce.\"\r\n\r\nIf there be a conspiracy to levy war, and afterwards war is levied,\r\nthe conspiracy is, in every one of the conspirators, an overt act\r\nof this species of treason, for there can be no accessary in high\r\ntreason, 5 Bac. 115. cites 3 inst. 9. 10. 138 Hales P. C. 14. Kel.\r\n19. 1 Hawk. 38. A compassing or conspiracy to levy war is no treason,\r\nfor there must be a levying of war _in facto_. But if many conspire\r\nto levy war, and some of them do levy the same according to the\r\nconspiracy, this is high treason in all, for in treason all are\r\nprincipals, and war is levied, 3 inst. 9. Foster 213.\r\n\r\nThe _painful_ task of applying the above rules of law to the several\r\ntransactions that we have been eye witnesses to, will never be mine.\r\nLet me however intreat you, to make the application in your own\r\nminds; and those of you that have continued hitherto faithful among\r\nthe faithless, Abdiel like, to persevere in your integrity; and\r\nthose of you that have been already ensnared by the accursed wiles\r\nof designing men, to cast yourselves immediately upon that mercy,\r\nso conspicuous through the British constitution, and which is the\r\nbrightest jewel in the imperial diadem.\r\n\r\nMASSACHUSETTENSIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESSED\r\n\r\n_To the Inhabitants of the Province of Massachusetts Bay_,\r\n\r\nFebruary 13, 1775.\r\n\r\n\r\nMY DEAR COUNTRYMEN,\r\n\r\nI offered to your consideration, last week, a few extracts from the\r\nlaw books, to enable those that have been but little conversant\r\nwith the law of the land, to form a judgment, and determine for\r\nthemselves, whether any have been so far beguiled and seduced from\r\ntheir allegiance, as to commit the most aggravated offence against\r\nsociety, high treason. The whigs reply, riots and insurrections are\r\nfrequent in England, the land from which we sprang; we are bone of\r\ntheir bone, and flesh of their flesh.--Granted; but at the same time\r\nbe it remembered, that in England the executive is commonly able\r\nand willing to suppress insurrections, the judiciary to distribute\r\nimpartial justice, and the legislative power to aid and strengthen\r\nthe two former if necessary; and whenever these have proved\r\nineffectual to allay intestine commotions, war, with its concomitant\r\nhorrors, have passed through the land, marking their rout with blood.\r\nThe bigger part of Britain has at some period or other, within the\r\nreach of history, been forfeited to the crown, by the rebellion of\r\nits proprietors.\r\n\r\nLet us now take a view of American grievances, and try, by the\r\nsure touchstone of reason and the constitution, whether there be\r\nany act or acts, on the part of the king or parliament, that will\r\njustify the whigs even in _foro conscientiæ_, in thus forcibly\r\nopposing their government. Will the alteration of the mode of\r\nappointing one branch of our provincial legislature furnish so much\r\nas an excuse for it, considering that our politicians, by their\r\nintrigues and machinations, had rendered the assembly incapable\r\nof answering the purpose of government, which is protection, and\r\nour charter was become as inefficacious as an old ballad? Or can\r\na plea of justification be founded on the parliament's giving us\r\nan exact transcript of English laws for returning jurors, when\r\nour own were insufficient to afford compensation to the injured,\r\nto suppress seditions, or even to restrain rebellion? It has been\r\nheretofore observed, that each member of the community is entitled\r\nto protection; for this he pays taxes, for this he relinquishes\r\nhis natural right of revenging injuries and redressing wrongs,\r\nand for this the sword of justice is placed in the hands of the\r\nmagistrate. It is notorious that the whigs had usurped the power\r\nof the province in a great measure, and exercised it by revenging\r\nthemselves on their opponents, or in compelling them to enlist\r\nunder their banners. Recollect the frequency of mobs and riots, the\r\ninvasions and demolitions of dwelling houses and other property,\r\nthe personal abuse, and frequent necessity of persons abandoning\r\ntheir habitations, the taking sanctuary on board men of war, or at\r\nthe castle, previous to the regulating bill. Consider that these\r\nsufferers were loyal subjects, violators of no law, that many of\r\nthem were crown officers, and were thus persecuted for no other\r\noffence, than that of executing the king's law. Consider further,\r\nthat if any of the sufferers sought redress in a court of law, he had\r\nthe whole whig interest to combat; they gathered like a cloud and\r\nhovered like harpies round the seat of justice, until the suitor was\r\neither condemned to pay cost to his antagonist, or recovered so small\r\ndamages, as that they were swallowed up in his own. Consider further,\r\nthat these riots were not the accidental or spontaneous risings of\r\nthe populace, but the result of the deliberations and mature councils\r\nof the whigs, and were sometimes headed and led to action by their\r\nprincipals. Consider further, that the general assembly lent no aid\r\nto the executive power. Weigh these things, my friends, and doubt\r\nif you can, whether the act for regulating our government did not\r\nflow from the parental tenderness of the British councils, to enable\r\nus to recover from anarchy, without Britain being driven to the\r\nnecessity of inflicting punishment, which is her strange work. Having\r\ntaken this cursory view of the convulsed state of the province, let\r\nus advert to our charter form of government, and we shall find its\r\ndistributions of power to have been so preposterous, as to render it\r\nnext to impossible for the province to recover by its own strength.\r\nThe council was elective annually by the house, liable to the\r\nnegative of the chair, and the chair restrained from acting, even in\r\nthe executive department, without the concurrence of the board. The\r\npolitical struggle is often between the governor and the house, and\r\nit is a maxim with politicians, that he that is not for us is against\r\nus. Accordingly, when party run high, if a counsellor adhered to the\r\ngovernor, the house refused to elect him the next year; if he adhered\r\nto the house, the governor negatived him; if he trimmed his bark so\r\nas to steer a middle course between Scylla and Charybdis, he was in\r\ndanger of suffering more by the neglect of both parties, than of\r\nbeing wrecked but on one.\r\n\r\nIn moderate times, this province has been happy under our charter\r\nform of government; but when the political storm arose, its original\r\ndefect became apparent. We have sometimes seen half a dozen sail of\r\ntory navigation unable, on an election day, to pass the bar formed by\r\nthe flux and reflux of the tides at the entrance of the harbour, and\r\nas many whiggish ones stranded the next morning on Governor's Island.\r\nThe whigs took the lead in this game, and therefore I think the blame\r\nought to rest upon them, though the tables were turned upon them in\r\nthe sequel. A slender acquaintance with human nature will inform,\r\nexperience has evinced, that a body of men thus constituted, are\r\nnot to be depended upon to act that vigorous, intrepid and decisive\r\npart, which the emergency of the late times required, and which\r\nmight have proved the salvation of the province. In short, the board\r\nwhich was intended to moderate between the governor and the house, or\r\nperhaps rather to support the former, was incapable of doing either\r\nby its original constitution. By the regulating act, the members\r\nof the board are appointed by the king in the council, and are not\r\nliable even to the suspension of the governor; their commissions are\r\n_durante bene placito_, and they are therefore far from independence.\r\nThe infant state of the colonies does not admit of a peerage, nor\r\nperhaps of any third branch of legislature wholly independent. In\r\nmost of the colonies, the council is appointed by mandamus, and the\r\nmembers are moreover liable to be suspended by the governor, by\r\nwhich means they are more dependant, than those appointed according\r\nto the regulating act; but no inconvenience arises from that mode\r\nof appointment. Long experience has evinced its utility. By this\r\nstatute, extraordinary powers are devolved upon the chair, to enable\r\nthe governor to maintain his authority, and to oppose with vigor\r\nthe daring spirit of independance, so manifest in the whigs. Town\r\nmeetings are restrained to prevent their passing traitorous resolves.\r\nHad these and many other innovations contained in this act, been made\r\nin moderate times, when due reverence was yielded to the magistrate,\r\nand obedience to the law, they might have been called grievances; but\r\nwe have no reason to think, that had the situation of the province\r\nbeen such that this statute would ever have had an existence--nor\r\nhave we any reason to doubt, but that it will be repealed, in whole\r\nor part, should our present form of government be found by experience\r\nto be productive of rapine or oppression. It is impossible that the\r\nking, lords or commons could have any sinister views in regulating\r\nthe government of this province. Sometimes we are told that charters\r\nare sacred. However sacred, they are forfeited through negligence or\r\n_abuse_ of their franchises, in which cases the law judges that the\r\nbody politic has broken the condition, upon which it was incorporated.\r\n\r\nThere are many instances of the negligence and abuse, that work the\r\nforfeiture of charters, delineated in law books. They also tell\r\nus, that all charters may be vacated by act of parliament. Had\r\nthe form of our provincial legislature been established by act of\r\nparliament, that act might have been constitutionally and equitably\r\nrepealed, when it was found to be incapable of answering the end\r\nof its institution. Stronger still is the present case, where the\r\nform of government was established by one branch of the legislature\r\nonly, viz. the king, and all three join in the revocation. This act\r\nwas however a fatal stroke to the ambitious views of our republican\r\npatriots. The monarchial part of the constitution was so guarded by\r\nit, as to be no longer vulnerable by their shafts, and all their\r\nfancied greatness vanished, like the baseless fabric of a vision.\r\nMany that had been long striving to attain a seat at the board,\r\nwith their faces thitherward, beheld, with infinite regret, their\r\ncompetitors advanced to the honors they aspired to themselves.\r\nThese disappointed, ambitious, and envious men, instil the poison\r\nof disaffection into the minds of the lower classes, and as soon\r\nas they are properly impregnated, exclaim, _the people_ never will\r\nsubmit to it. They now would urge them into certain ruin, to prevent\r\nthe execution of an act of parliament, designed and calculated to\r\nrestore peace and harmony to the province, and to recal that happy\r\nstate, when year rolled round on year, in a continual increase of our\r\nfelicity.\r\n\r\nThe Quebec bill is another capital grievance, because the Canadians\r\nare tolerated in the enjoyment of their religion, which they were\r\nentitled to, by an article of capitulation, when they submitted\r\nto the British arms. This toleration is not an exclusion of the\r\nprotestant religion, which is established in every part of the\r\nempire, as firmly as civil polity can establish it. It is a strange\r\nkind of reasoning to argue, from the French inhabitants of the\r\nconquered province of Quebec being tolerated, in the enjoyment of the\r\nRoman Catholic religion, in which they were educated, and in which\r\nalone they repose their hope of eternal salvation; that therefore\r\ngovernment intends to deprive us of the enjoyment of the protestant\r\nreligion, in which alone we believe, especially as the political\r\ninterests of Britain depend upon protestant connexions, and the\r\nking's being a protestant himself is an indispensable condition of\r\nhis wearing the crown. This circumstance however served admirably\r\nfor a fresh stimulus, and was eagerly grasped by the disaffected\r\nof all orders. It added pathos to pulpit oratory. We often see\r\nresolves and seditious letters interspersed with _popery_ here\r\nand there in Italics. If any of the clergy have endeavoured, from\r\nthis circumstance, to alarm their too credulous audiences, with an\r\napprehension that their religious privileges were in danger, thereby\r\nto excite them to take up arms, we must lament the depravity of the\r\nbest of men; but human nature stands apalled when we reflect upon the\r\naggravated guilt of prostituting our holy religion to the accursed\r\npurposes of treason and rebellion. As to our lay politicians, I\r\nhave long since ceased to wonder at any thing in them; but it\r\nmay be observed that there is no surer mark of a bad cause, than\r\nfor its advocates to recur to such pitiful shifts to support it.\r\nThis instance plainly indicates that their sole dependance is in\r\npreventing the passions subsiding, and cool reason resuming its seat.\r\nIt is a mark of their shrewdness however, for whenever reason shall\r\nresume its seat, the political cheat will be detected, stand confest\r\nin its native turpitude, and the political knave be branded with\r\nmarks of infamy, adequate, if possible, to the enormity of his crimes.\r\n\r\nMASSACHUSETTENSIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESSED\r\n\r\n_To the Inhabitants of the Province of Massachusetts Bay_,\r\n\r\nFebruary 20, 1775.\r\n\r\n\r\nMY DEAR COUNTRYMEN,\r\n\r\nIt would be an endless task to remark minutely upon each of the\r\nfancied grievances, that swarm and cluster, fill and deform the\r\nAmerican chronicles. An adeptness at discovering grievances has\r\nlately been one of the principal recommendations to public notice and\r\npopular applause. We have had geniuses selected for that purpose,\r\ncalled committees upon grievances; a sagacious set they were, and\r\ndiscovered a multitude before it was known, that they themselves were\r\nthe greatest grievances that the country was infested with. The case\r\nis shortly this; the whigs suppose the colonies to be separate or\r\ndistinct states: having fixed this opinion in their minds, they are\r\nat no loss for grievances. Could I agree with them in their first\r\nprinciple, I should acquiesce in many of their deductions; for in\r\nthat case every act of parliament, extending to the colonies, and\r\nevery movement of the crown to carry them into execution, would\r\nbe really grievances, however wise and salutary they might be in\r\nthemselves, as they would be exertions of a power that we were not\r\nconstitutionally subject to, and would deserve the name of usurpation\r\nand tyranny; but deprived of this their corner stone, the terrible\r\nfabric of grievances vanishes, like castles raised by enchantment,\r\nand leaves the wondering spectator amazed and confounded at the\r\ndeception. He suspects himself to have but just awoke from sleep, or\r\nrecovered from a trance, and that the formidable spectre, that had\r\nfroze him with horror, was no more than the creature of a vision, or\r\nthe delusion of a dream.\r\n\r\nUpon this point, whether the colonies are distinct states or not,\r\nour patriots have rashly tendered Great Britain an issue, against\r\nevery principle of law and constitution, against reason and common\r\nprudence. There is no arbiter between us but the sword; and that\r\nthe decision of that tribunal will be against us, reason foresees,\r\nas plainly as it can discover any event that lies in the womb of\r\nfuturity. No person, unless actuated by ambition, pride, malice,\r\nenvy, or a malignant combination of the whole, that verges towards\r\nmadness, and hurries the man away from himself, would wage war upon\r\nsuch unequal terms. No honest man would engage himself, much less\r\nplunge his country into the calamities of a war upon equal terms,\r\nwithout first settling with his conscience, in the retired moments\r\nof reflection, the important question respecting the justice of\r\nhis cause. To do this, we must hear and weigh every thing that is\r\nfairly adduced, on either side of the question, with equal attention\r\nand care. A disposition to drink in with avidity, what favours our\r\nhypothesis, and to reject with disgust whatever contravenes it, is\r\nan infallible mark of a narrow, selfish mind. In matters of small\r\nmoment, such obstinacy is weakness and folly, in important ones,\r\nfatal madness. There are many among us, that have devoted themselves\r\nto the slavish dominion of prejudice; indeed the more liberal have\r\nseldom had an opportunity of bringing the question to a fair examen.\r\nThe eloquence of the bar, the desk and the senate, the charms of\r\npoetry, the expressions of painting, sculpture and statuary have\r\nconspired to fix and rivet ideas of independance upon the mind of the\r\ncolonists. The overwhelming torrent, supplied from so many fountains,\r\nrolled on with increasing rapidity and violence, till it became\r\nsuperior to all restraint. It was the reign of passion; the small,\r\nstill voice of reason was refused audience. I have observed that the\r\npress was heretofore open to but one side of the question, which\r\nhas given offence to a writer in Edes and Gill's paper, under the\r\nsignature of Novanglus, to whom I have many things to say. I would at\r\npresent ask him, if the convention of committees for the county of\r\nWorcester, in recommending to the inhabitants of that county not to\r\ntake newspapers, published by two of the printers in this town, and\r\ntwo at New York, have not affected to be licensers of the press? And\r\nwhether, by proscribing these printers, and endeavouring to deprive\r\nthem of a livelihood, they have not manifested an illiberal, bigoted,\r\narbitrary, malevolent disposition? And whether, by thus attempting\r\nto destroy the liberty of the press, they have not betrayed a\r\nconsciousness of the badness of their cause?\r\n\r\nOur warriors tell us, that the parliament shall be permitted to\r\nlegislate for the purposes of regulating trade, but the parliament\r\nhath most unrighteously asserted, that it \"had, hath, and of right\r\nought to have, full power and authority to make laws and statutes\r\nof sufficient force and validity to bind the colonies in all\r\ncases whatever,\" that this claim is without any qualification or\r\nrestriction, is an innovation, and inconsistent with liberty. Let\r\nus candidly inquire into these three observations, upon the statute\r\ndeclaratory of the authority of parliament. As to its universality,\r\nit is true there are no exceptions expressed, but there is no general\r\nrule without exceptions, expressed or implied.\r\n\r\nThe implied ones in this case are obvious. It is evident that\r\nthe intent and meaning of this act, was to assert the supremacy\r\nof parliament in the colonies, that is, that its constitutional\r\nauthority to make laws and statutes binding upon the colonies, is,\r\nand ever had been as ample, as it is to make laws binding upon the\r\nrealm. No one that reads the declaratory statute, not even prejudice\r\nitself, can suppose that the parliament meant to assert thereby a\r\nright or power to deprive the colonists of their lives, to enslave\r\nthem, or to make any law respecting the colonies, that would not be\r\nconstitutional, were it made respecting Great Britain. By an act\r\nof parliament passed in the year 1650, it was declared concerning\r\nthe colonies and plantations in America, that they had \"ever since\r\nthe planting thereof been and ought to be subject to such laws,\r\norders and regulations, as are or shall be made by the parliament of\r\nEngland.\" This declaration though differing in expression, is the\r\nsame in substance with the other. Our house of representatives, in\r\ntheir dispute with governor Hutchinson, concerning the supremacy of\r\nparliament, say, \"It is difficult, if possible, to draw a line of\r\ndistinction between the universal authority of parliament over the\r\ncolonies, and no authority at all.\"\r\n\r\nThe declaratory statute was intended more especially to assert the\r\nright of parliament, to make laws and statutes for raising a revenue\r\nin America, lest the repeal of the stamp act might be urged as a\r\ndisclaimer of the right. Let us now inquire whether a power to raise\r\na revenue be not the inherent, unalienable right of the supreme\r\nlegislative of every well regulated state, where the hereditary\r\nrevenues of the crown, or established revenues of the state are\r\ninsufficient of themselves; and whether that power be not necessarily\r\ncoextensive with the power of legislation, or rather necessarily\r\nimplied in it.\r\n\r\nThe end or design of government, as has been already observed, is\r\nthe security of the people from internal violence and rapacity, and\r\nfrom foreign invasion. The supreme power of a state must necessarily\r\nbe so extensive and ample as to answer those purposes, otherwise it\r\nis constituted in vain and degenerates into empty parade and mere\r\nostentatious pageantry. These purposes cannot be answered without\r\na power to raise a revenue; for without it neither the laws can be\r\nexecuted, nor the state defended. This revenue ought, in national\r\nconcerns, to be apportioned throughout the whole empire according\r\nto the abilities of the several parts, as the claim of each to\r\nprotection, is equal; a refusal to yield the former is as unjust as\r\nthe withholding of the latter. Were any part of an empire exempt from\r\ncontributing their proportionable part of the revenue, necessary for\r\nthe whole, such exemption would be manifest injustice to the rest\r\nof the empire; as it must of course bear more than its proportion\r\nof the public burden, and it would amount to an additional tax. If\r\nthe proportion of each part was to be determined only by itself in a\r\nseparate legislature, it would not only involve in it the absurdity\r\nof _imperium in imperio_, but the perpetual contention arising\r\nfrom the predominant principle of self-interest in each, without\r\nhaving any common arbiter between them, would render the disjointed,\r\ndiscordant, torn, and dismembered state incapable of collecting or\r\nconducting its force and energy for the preservation of the whole,\r\nas emergencies might require. A government thus constituted, would\r\ncontain the seeds of dissolution in its first principles, and must\r\nsoon destroy itself.\r\n\r\nI have already shewn, that by your first charter, this province was\r\nto be subject to taxation, after the lapse of twenty-one years, and\r\nthat the authority of parliament to impose such taxes, was claimed so\r\nearly as the year 1642.\r\n\r\nIn the patent for Pennsylvania, which is now in force, there is this\r\nclause, \"And further our pleasure is, and by these presents, for us,\r\n&c. we do covenant and grant to, and with the said William Penn,\r\n&c. that we, &c. shall at no time hereafter set or make, or cause\r\nto be set, any imposition, custom, or other taxation, or rate or\r\ncontribution whatsoever, in and upon the dwellers, and inhabitants of\r\nthe aforesaid province, for their lands, tenements, goods or chattels\r\nwithin the said province, or in and upon any goods or merchandise\r\nwithin the said province, to be laden or unladen within the ports or\r\nharbours of the said province, unless the same be with the consent of\r\nthe proprietors, chief governor, or assembly, or _act of parliament_.\"\r\n\r\nThese are stubborn facts; they are incapable of being winked out of\r\nexistence, how much soever, we may be disposed to shut our eyes upon\r\nthem. They prove, that the claim of a right to raise a revenue in the\r\ncolonies, exclusive of the grants of their own assemblies, is coeval\r\nwith the colonies themselves. I shall next shew, that there has been\r\nan actual, uninterrupted exercise of that right, by the parliament\r\ntime immemorial.\r\n\r\nMASSACHUSETTENSIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESSED\r\n\r\n_To the Inhabitants of the Province of Massachusetts Bay_,\r\n\r\nFebruary 27, 1775.\r\n\r\n\r\nMY DEAR COUNTRYMEN,\r\n\r\nBy an act of parliament made in the twenty-fifth year of the reign\r\nof Charles 2d. duties are laid upon goods and merchandise of various\r\nkinds, exported from the colonies to foreign countries, or carried\r\nfrom one colony to another, payable on exportation. I will recite\r\na part of it, viz: \"For so much of the said commodities as shall\r\nbe laden and put on board such ship or vessel; that is to say, for\r\nsugar, white, the hundred weight, five shillings; and brown and\r\nMuscovados, the hundred weight, one shilling and six pence; tobacco,\r\nthe pound, one penny; cotton wool, the pound, one half-penny; for\r\nindigo, two-pence; ginger, the hundred weight, one shilling; logwood,\r\nthe hundred weight, five pounds; fustic, and all other dying wood,\r\nthe hundred weight, six-pence; cocoa, the pound, one-penny, to be\r\n_levied, collected, and paid_, at such places, and to such collectors\r\nand other officers, as shall be appointed in the respective\r\nplantations, to collect, levy, and receive the same, before the\r\nlanding thereof, and under such penalties, both to the officers,\r\nand upon the goods, as for non-payment of, or _defrauding his\r\nmajesty of his customs in England_. And for the better _collecting\r\nof the several rates and duties imposed by this act_, be it enacted\r\nthat this whole business shall be ordered and managed, and the\r\nseveral duties hereby imposed shall be caused _to be levied by the\r\ncommissioners of the customs in England_, by and under the authority\r\nof the lord treasurer of England, or commissioners of the treasury.\"\r\n\r\nIt is apparent, from the reasoning of this statute, that these duties\r\nwere imposed for the sole purpose of revenue. There has lately\r\nbeen a most ingenious play upon the words and expressions _tax_,\r\n_revenue_, _purpose of raising a revenue_, _sole purpose of raising\r\na revenue_, _express purpose of raising a revenue_, as though their\r\nbeing inserted in, or left out of a statute, would make any essential\r\ndifference in the statute. This is mere playing with words; for if,\r\nfrom the whole tenor of the act, it is evident, that the intent of\r\nthe legislature was to tax, rather than to regulate the trade, by\r\nimposing duties on goods and merchandise, it is to all intents and\r\npurposes, an instance of taxation, be the form of words, in which\r\nthe statute is conceived, what it will. That such was the intent of\r\nthe legislature, in this instance, any one that will take the pains\r\nto read it, will be convinced. There have been divers alterations\r\nmade in this by subsequent statutes, but some of the above taxes\r\nremain, and are collected and paid in the colonies to this day. By an\r\nact of the 7th. and 8th. of William and Mary, it is enacted, \"that\r\nevery seaman, whatsoever, that shall serve his majesty, or any other\r\nperson whatever in any of his majesty's ships or vessels, whatsoever,\r\nbelonging, or to belong to any subjects of England, or any other his\r\nmajesty's dominions, shall allow, and there shall be paid out of\r\nthe wages of every such seaman, to grow due for such his service,\r\nsix-pence per annum for the better support of the said hospital, and\r\nto augment the _revenue_ thereof.\" This tax was imposed in the reign\r\nof king William 3d. of blessed memory, and is still levied in the\r\ncolonies. It would require a volume to recite, or minutely to remark\r\nupon all the revenue acts that relate to America. We find them in\r\nmany reigns, imposing new duties, taking off, or reducing old ones,\r\nand making provision for their collection, or new appropriations\r\nof them. By an act of the 7th. and 8th. of William and Mary,\r\nentitled, \"an act for preventing frauds and regulating abuses in the\r\nplantations.\" All former acts respecting the plantations are renewed,\r\nand all ships and vessels coming into any port here, are liable to\r\nthe same regulations and restrictions, as ships in the ports in\r\nEngland are liable to; and enacts, \"_That the officers for collecting\r\nand managing his majesty's revenue, and inspecting the plantation\r\ntrade in many of the said plantations_, shall have the same powers\r\nand authority for visiting and searching of ships, and taking their\r\nentries, and for seizing, or securing, or bringing on shore any of\r\nthe goods prohibited to be imported or exported into or out of any\r\nof the said colonies and plantations, _or for which any duties are\r\npayable, or ought to be paid by any of the before mentioned acts, as\r\nare provided for the officers of the customs in England_.\"\r\n\r\nThe act of the 9th of Queen Ann, for establishing a post-office,\r\ngives this reason for its establishment, and for laying taxes thereby\r\nimposed on the carriage of letters in Great Britain and Ireland, the\r\ncolonies and plantations in North America and the West Indies, and\r\nall other her majesty's dominions and territories, \"that the business\r\nmay be done in such manner as may be most beneficial to the people\r\nof these kingdoms, and her majesty may be supplied, and the revenue\r\narising by the said office, better improved, settled, and secured to\r\nher majesty, her heirs, and successors.\" The celebrated patriot, Dr.\r\nFranklin, was till lately one of the principal collectors of it. The\r\nmerit in putting the post-office in America upon such a footing as to\r\nyield a large revenue to the crown, is principally ascribed to him by\r\nthe whigs. I would not wish to detract from the real merit of that\r\ngentleman, but had a tory been half so assiduous in increasing the\r\nAmerica revenue, Novanglus would have wrote parricide at the end of\r\nhis name. By an act of the sixth of George 2d. a duty is laid on all\r\nforeign rum, molasses, syrups, sugars, and paneles, to be _raised,\r\nlevied, collected, and paid unto, and for the use of his majesty,\r\nhis heirs, and successors_. The preamble of an act of the fourth\r\nof his present majesty declares, \"that _it is just and necessary\r\nthat a revenue in America for defraying the expences of defending,\r\nprotecting, and securing the same_,\" &c. by which act duties are laid\r\nupon foreign sugars, coffee, Madeira wine; upon Portugal, Spanish,\r\nand all other wine, except French wine, imported from Great Britain;\r\nupon silks, bengals, stuffs, calico, linen cloth, cambric, and lawn,\r\nimported from particular places.\r\n\r\nThus, my friends, it is evident, that the parliament has been in the\r\nactual, uninterrupted use and exercise of the right claimed by them,\r\nto raise a revenue in America, from a period more remote than the\r\ngrant of the present charter, to this day. These revenue acts have\r\nnever been called unconstitutional till very lately. Both whigs and\r\ntories acknowledged them to be constitutional. In 1764, Governor\r\nBernard wrote and transmitted to his friends, his polity alluded\r\nto, and in part recited by Novanglus, wherein he asserts the right\r\nor authority of the parliament to tax the colonies. Mr. Otis, whose\r\npatriotism, sound policy, profound learning, integrity and honour,\r\nis mentioned in strong terms by Novanglus, in the self-same year, in\r\na pamphlet which he published to the whole world, asserts the right\r\nor authority of parliament to tax the colonies, as roundly as ever\r\nGovernor Bernard did, which I shall have occasion to take an extract\r\nfrom hereafter. Mr. Otis was at that time the most popular man in the\r\nprovince, and continued his popularity many years afterwards.\r\n\r\nIs it not a most astonishing instance of caprice, or infatuation,\r\nthat a province, torn from its foundations, should be precipitating\r\nitself into a war with Great Britain, because the British parliament\r\nasserts its right of raising a revenue in America, inasmuch as the\r\nclaim of that right is as ancient as the colonies themselves; and\r\nthere is at present no grievous exercise of it? The parliaments\r\nrefusing to repeal the act is the ostensible foundation of our\r\nquarrel. If we ask the whigs whether the pitiful three penny duty\r\nupon a luxurious, unwholesome, foreign commodity gives just occasion\r\nfor the opposition; they tell us it is the precedent they are\r\ncontending about, insinuating that it is an innovation. But this\r\nground is not tenable; for a total repeal of the tea act would not\r\nserve us upon the score of precedents. They are numerous without\r\nthis. The whigs have been extremely partial respecting tea. Poor\r\ntea has been made the shibboleth of party, while molasses, wine,\r\ncoffee, indigo, &c. &c. have been unmolested. A person that drinks\r\nNew England rum, distilled from molasses, subject to a like duty,\r\nis equally deserving of a coat of tar and feathers, with him that\r\ndrinks tea. A coffee drinker is as culpable as either, viewed in a\r\npolitical light. But, say our patriots, if the British parliament\r\nmay take a penny from us, without our consent, they may a pound, and\r\nso on, till they have filched away all our property. This incessant\r\nincantation operates like a spell or charm, and checks the efforts of\r\nloyalty in many an honest breast. Let us give it its full weight. Do\r\nthey mean, that if the parliament has a right to raise a revenue of\r\none penny on the colonies, that they must therefore have a _right_\r\nto wrest from us all our property? If this be their meaning, I deny\r\ntheir deduction; for the supreme legislature can have no right to\r\ntax any part of the empire to a greater amount, than its just and\r\nequitable proportion of the necessary, national expence. This is\r\na line drawn by the constitution itself. Do they mean, that if we\r\nadmit that the parliament may constitutionally raise one penny upon\r\nus for the purposes of revenue, they will probably proceed from\r\nlight to heavy taxes, till their impositions become grievous and\r\nintolerable? This amounts to no more than a denial of the right,\r\nlest it should be abused. But an argument drawn from the actual\r\nabuse of a power, will not conclude to the illegality of such power,\r\nmuch less will an argument drawn from a capability of its being\r\nabused. If it would, we might readily argue away all power, that\r\nman is entrusted with. I will admit, that a power of taxation is\r\nmore liable to abuse, than legislation separately considered; and\r\nit would give me pleasure to see some other line drawn; some other\r\nbarrier erected, than what the constitution has already done, if it\r\nbe possible, whereby the constitutional authority of the supreme\r\nlegislature, might be preserved entire, and America be guaranteed\r\nin every right and exemption, consistent with her subordination and\r\ndependance. But this can only be done by parliament. I repeat I am\r\nno advocate for a land tax, or any other kind of internal tax, nor\r\ndo I think we were in any danger of them. I have not been able to\r\ndiscover one symptom of any such intention in the parliament, since\r\nthe repeal of the stamp-act. Indeed, the principal speakers of the\r\nmajority, that repealed the stamp-act drew the line for us, between\r\ninternal and external taxation, and I think we ought, in honour,\r\njustice, and good policy, to have acquiesced therein, at least until\r\nthere was some burdensome exercise of taxation. For there is but\r\nlittle danger from the latter, that is from duties laid upon trade,\r\nas any grievous restriction or imposition on American trade, would\r\nbe sensibly felt by the British; and I think with Dr. Franklin, that\r\n\"they (the British nation) have a natural and equitable right to some\r\ntoll or duty upon merchandizes carried through that part of their\r\ndominions, viz: the American seas, towards defraying the expence they\r\nare at in ships to maintain the safety of that carriage.\" These were\r\nhis words in his examination at the bar of the house, in 1765. _Sed\r\ntempora mutantur et nos mutamur in illis._ Before we appeal to heaven\r\nfor the justice of our cause, we ought to determine with ourselves,\r\nsome other questions, whether America is not obliged in equity to\r\ncontribute something toward the national defence: whether the present\r\nAmerican revenue, amounts to our proportion: and whether we can, with\r\nany tolerable grace, accuse Great Britain of _injustice_ in imposing\r\nthe late duties, when our assemblies were previously called upon, and\r\nrefused to make any provision for themselves. These, with several\r\nimaginary grievances, not yet particularly remarked upon, I shall\r\nconsider in reviewing the publications of Novanglus; a performance\r\nwhich, though not destitute of ingenuity, I read with a mixture of\r\ngrief and indignation, as it seems to be calculated to blow up every\r\nspark of animosity, and to kindle such a flame, as must inevitably\r\nconsume a great part of this once happy province, before it can be\r\nextinguished.\r\n\r\nMASSACHUSETTENSIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESSED\r\n\r\n_To the Inhabitants of the Province of Massachusetts Bay_,\r\n\r\nMarch 6, 1775.\r\n\r\n\r\nMY DEAR COUNTRYMEN,\r\n\r\nNovanglus, and all others, have an indisputable right to publish\r\ntheir sentiments and opinions to the world, provided they conform\r\nto truth, decency, and the municipal laws, of the society of which\r\nthey are members. He has wrote with a professed design of exposing\r\nthe errors and sophistry which he supposes are frequent in my\r\npublications. His design is so far laudable, and I intend to correct\r\nthem wherever he convinces me there is an instance of either. I\r\nhave no objection to the minutest disquisition; contradiction and\r\ndisputation, like the collision of flint and steel, often strike\r\nout new light; the bare opinions of either of us, unaccompanied\r\nby the grounds and reasons upon which they were formed, must be\r\nconsidered only as propositions made to the reader, for him to adopt,\r\nor reject as his own reason may judge, or feelings dictate. A large\r\nproportion of the labours of Novanglus consist in denials of my\r\nallegations in matters of such public notoriety, as that no reply\r\nis necessary. He has alleged many things destitute of foundation;\r\nthose that affect the main object of our pursuit, but remotely, if\r\nat all, I shall pass by without particular remark; others, of a more\r\ninteresting nature, I shall review minutely. After some general\r\nobservations upon Massachusettensis, he slides into a most virulent\r\nattack upon particular persons, by names, with such incomparable\r\nease, that shews him to be a great proficient in the modern art\r\nof detraction and calumny. He accuses the late governor Shirley,\r\ngovernor Hutchinson, the late lieutenant governor Oliver, the late\r\njudge Russell, Mr. Paxton, and brigadier Ruggles, of a conspiracy to\r\nenslave their country. The charge is high coloured; if it be just,\r\nthey merit the epithets dealt about so indiscriminately, of enemies\r\nto their country. If it be groundless, Novanglus has acted the part\r\nof an assassin, in thus attempting to destroy the reputation of the\r\nliving; and of something worse than an assassin, in entering those\r\nhallowed mansions, where the wicked commonly cease from troubling,\r\nand the weary are at rest, to disturb the repose of the dead. That\r\nthe charge is groundless respecting governor Bernard, governor\r\nHutchinson, and the late lieutenant governor, I dare assert, because\r\nthey have been acquitted of it in such a manner, as every good\r\ncitizen must acquiesce in. Our house of representatives, acting as\r\nthe grand inquest of the province, presented them before the king in\r\ncouncil, and after a full hearing, they were acquitted with honour,\r\nand the several impeachments dismissed, as groundless, vexatious,\r\nand scandalous. The accusation of the house was similar to this of\r\nNovanglus; the court they chose to institute their suit in, was of\r\ncompetent and high jurisdiction, and its decision final. This is\r\na sufficient answer to the state charges made by this writer, so\r\nfar as they respect the governors Bernard, Hutchinson and Oliver,\r\nwhom he accuses as principals; and it is a general rule, that\r\nif the principal be innocent, the accessary cannot be guilty. A\r\ndetermination of a constitutional arbiter ought to seal up the lips\r\nof even prejudice itself, in silence; otherwise litigation must be\r\nendless. This calumniator, nevertheless, has the effrontery to renew\r\nthe charge in a public news paper, although thereby he arraigns our\r\nmost gracious Sovereign, and the lords of the privy council, as well\r\nas the gentlemen he has named. Not content with wounding the honour\r\nof judges, counsellors and governors, with missile weapons, darted\r\nfrom an obscure corner, he now aims a blow at majesty itself. Any one\r\nmay accuse; but accusation, unsupported by proof, recoils upon the\r\nhead of the accuser. It is entertaining enough to consider the crimes\r\nand misdemeanors alleged, and then examine the evidence he adduces,\r\nstript of the false glare he has thrown upon it.\r\n\r\nThe crimes are these; the persons named by him conspired together\r\nto _enslave_ their country, in consequence of a plan, the outlines\r\nof which have been drawn by sir Edmund Andross and others, and\r\nhanded down by tradition to the present times. He tells us that\r\ngovernor Shirley, in 1754, communicated the profound secret, the\r\ngreat design of taxing the colonies by act of parliament, to the\r\nsagacious gentleman, eminent philosopher, and distinguished patriot,\r\nDr. Franklin. The profound secret is this; after the commencement\r\nof hostilities between the English and French colonies in the last\r\nwar, a convention of committees from several provinces were called by\r\nthe king, to agree upon some general plan of defence. The principal\r\ndifficulty they met with was in devising means whereby each colony\r\nmight be obliged to contribute its proportionable part. General\r\nShirley proposed _that application should be made to parliament to\r\nimpower the committees of the several colonies to tax the whole\r\naccording to their several proportions_. This plan was adopted by the\r\nconvention, and approved of by the assembly in New York, who passed a\r\nresolve in these words: \"That the scheme proposed by governor Shirley\r\nfor the defence of the British colonies in North America, is well\r\nconcerted, and that this colony joins therein.\" This however did not\r\nsucceed, and he proposed another, viz. for the parliament to assess\r\neach one's proportion, and in case of failure to raise it on their\r\npart, that it should be done by parliament. This is the profound\r\nsecret. His assiduity, in endeavouring to have some effectual plan\r\nof general defence established, is, by the false colouring of this\r\nwriter, represented as an attempt to aggrandise himself, family and\r\nfriends; and that gentleman, under whose administration the several\r\nparties in the province were as much united, and the whole province\r\nrendered as happy as it ever was, for so long a time together, is\r\ncalled a \"crafty, busy, ambitious, intriguing, enterprizing man.\"\r\nThis attempt of Governor Shirley for a parliamentary taxation,\r\nis however a circumstance strongly militating with this writer's\r\nhypothesis, for the approbation shewn to the Governor's proposal\r\nby the convention, which consisted of persons from the several\r\ncolonies, not inferior in point of discernment, integrity, knowledge\r\nor patriotism to the members of our late _grand_ congress, and the\r\nvote of the New York assembly furnishes pretty strong evidence that\r\nthe authority of parliament, even in point of taxation, was not\r\ndoubted in that day. Even Dr. Franklin, in the letter alluded to,\r\ndoes not deny the right. His objections go to the inexpediency of the\r\nmeasure. He supposes it would create uneasiness in the minds of the\r\ncolonists should they be thus taxed, unless they were previously\r\nallowed to send representatives to parliament. If Dr. Franklin really\r\nsupposes that the parliament has no constitutional right to raise a\r\nrevenue in America, I must confess myself at a loss to reconcile his\r\nconduct in accepting the office of post-master, and his assiduity\r\nin increasing the revenue in that department, to the patriotism\r\npredicated of him by Novanglus, especially as this unfortunately\r\nhappens to be an internal tax. This writer then tells us, that the\r\nplan was interrupted by the war, and afterwards by Governor Pownal's\r\nadministration. That Messieurs Hutchinson and Oliver, stung with envy\r\nat Governor Pownal's favourites, propagated slanders respecting him\r\nto render him uneasy in his seat. My answer is this, that he that\r\npublishes such falsehoods as these in a public newspaper, with an air\r\nof seriousness, insults the understanding of the public, more than he\r\ninjures the individuals he defames. In the next place we are told,\r\nthat Governor Bernard was the proper man for this purpose, and he\r\nwas employed by the junto to suggest to the ministry the project of\r\ntaxing the colonies by act of parliament. Sometimes Governor Bernard\r\nis the arch enemy of America, the source of all our troubles, now\r\nonly a tool in the hands of others. I wish Novanglus's memory had\r\nserved him better, his tale might have been consistent with itself,\r\nhowever variant from truth. After making these assertions with equal\r\ngravity and assurance, he tells us, he does not advance this without\r\nevidence. I had been looking out for evidence a long time, and was\r\nall attention when it was promised, but my disappointment was equal\r\nto the expectation he had raised, when I found the evidence amounted\r\nto nothing more than Governor Bernard's letters and principles of\r\nlaw and polity, wherein he asserts the supremacy of parliament over\r\nthe colonies both as to legislation and taxation. Where this writer\r\ngot his logic, I do not know. Reduced to a syllogism, his argument\r\nstands thus; Governor Bernard, in 1764, wrote and transmitted to\r\nEngland certain letters and principles of law and polity, wherein\r\nhe asserts the right of parliament to tax the colonies; Messieurs\r\nHutchinson and Oliver were in unison with him in all his measures;\r\ntherefore Messieurs Hutchinson and Oliver employed Governor Bernard\r\nto suggest to the ministry the project of taxing the colonies by\r\nact of parliament. The letters and principles are the whole of the\r\nevidence, and this is all the appearance of argument contained in\r\nhis publication. Let us examine the premises. That Governor Bernard\r\nasserted the right of parliament to tax the colonies in 1764, is\r\ntrue. So did Mr. Otis, in a pamphlet he published the self-same year,\r\nfrom which I have already taken an extract. In a pamphlet published\r\nin 1765, Mr. Otis tells us, \"it is certain that the parliament of\r\nGreat Britain hath a just, clear, equitable and constitutional right,\r\npower and authority to bind the colonies by all acts wherein they are\r\nnamed. Every lawyer, nay every Tyro, knows this; no less certain is\r\nit that the parliament of Great Britain has a just and _equitable_\r\nright, power and authority to impose taxes on the colonies _internal\r\nand external, on lands as well as on trade_.\" But does it follow from\r\nGovernor Bernard's transmitting his principles of polity to four\r\npersons in England, or from Mr. Otis's publishing to the whole world\r\nsimilar principles, that either the one or the other suggested to the\r\nministry the project of taxing the colonies by act of parliament?\r\nHardly, supposing the transmission and publication had been prior to\r\nthe resolution of parliament to that purpose; but very unfortunately\r\nfor our reasoner, they were both subsequent to it, and were the\r\neffect and not the cause.\r\n\r\nThe history of the stamp act is this. At the close of the last war,\r\nwhich was a native of America, and increased the national debt\r\nupwards of sixty millions, it was thought by parliament to be but\r\nequitable, that an additional revenue should be raised in America,\r\ntowards defraying the necessary charges of keeping it in a state\r\nof defence. A resolve of this nature was passed, and the colonies\r\nmade acquainted with it through their agents, in 1764, that their\r\nassemblies might make the necessary provision if they would. The\r\nassemblies neglected doing any thing, and the parliament passed the\r\nstamp act. There is not so much as a colourable pretence that any\r\nAmerican had a hand in the matter. Had governor Bernard, governor\r\nHutchinson, or the late lieutenant governor been any way instrumental\r\nin obtaining the stamp act, it is very strange that not a glimpse\r\nof evidence should ever have appeared, especially when we consider\r\nthat their private correspondence has been published, letters which\r\nwere written in the full confidence of unsuspecting friendship. The\r\nevidence, as Novanglus calls it, is wretchedly deficient as to fixing\r\nthe charge upon governor Bernard; but, even admitting that governor\r\nBernard suggested to the ministry the design of taxing, there is no\r\nkind of evidence to prove that the junto, as this elegant writer\r\ncalls the others, approved of it, much less that they employed him to\r\ndo it. But, says he, no one can doubt but that Messieurs Hutchinson\r\nand Oliver were in unison with governor Bernard, in all his measures.\r\nThis is not a fact, Mr. Hutchinson dissented from him respecting the\r\nalteration of our charter, and wrote to his friends in England to\r\nprevent it. Whether governor Bernard wrote in favour of the stamp\r\nact being repealed or not I cannot say, but I know that governor\r\nHutchinson did, and have reason to think his letters had great weight\r\nin turning the scale, which hung doubtful a long time, in favour of\r\nthe repeal. These facts are known to many in the province, whigs as\r\nwell as tories, yet such was the infatuation that prevailed, that\r\nthe mob destroyed his house upon supposition that he was the patron\r\nof the stamp act. Even in the letters wrote to the late Mr. Whately,\r\nwe find him advising to a total repeal of the tea act. It cannot be\r\nfairly inferred from persons' intimacy or mutual confidence that\r\nthey always approve of each others plans. Messieurs Otis, Cushing,\r\nHancock and Adams were as confidential friends, and made common cause\r\nequally with the other gentlemen. May we thence infer, that the three\r\nlatter hold that the parliament has a just and _equitable right_\r\nto impose taxes on the colonies? Or, that \"the time may come, when\r\nthe real interest of the whole may require an act of parliament to\r\nannihilate all our charters?\" For these also are Mr. Otis's words.\r\nOr may we lay it down as a principle to reason from, that these\r\ngentlemen never disagree respecting measures? We know they do often,\r\nvery materially. This writer is unlucky both in his principles and\r\ninferences. But where is the evidence respecting brigadier Ruggles,\r\nMr. Paxton, and the late judge Russel? He does not produce even the\r\nshadow of a shade. He does not even pretend that they were in unison\r\nwith governor Bernard in all his measures. In matters of small moment\r\na man may be allowed to amuse with ingenious fiction, but in personal\r\naccusation, in matters so interesting both to the individual and to\r\nthe public, reason and candour require something more than assertion,\r\nwithout proof, declamation without argument, and censure without\r\ndignity or moderation: this however, is characteristic of Novanglus.\r\nIt is the stale trick of the whig writers feloniously to stab the\r\nreputation, when their antagonists are invulnerable in their public\r\nconduct.\r\n\r\nThese gentlemen were all of them, and the survivers still continue\r\nto be, friends of the English constitution, equally tenacious of\r\nthe privileges of the people, and of the prerogative of the crown,\r\nzealous advocates for the colonies continuing their constitutional\r\ndependance upon Great Britain, as they think it no less the interest\r\nthan the duty of the colonists; averse to tyranny and oppression\r\nin all their forms, and always ready to exert themselves for the\r\nrelief of the oppressed, though they differ materially from the\r\nwhigs in the mode of obtaining it; they discharged the duties of\r\nthe several important departments they were called to fill, with\r\nequal faithfulness and ability; their public services gained them\r\nthe confidence of the people, real merit drew after it popularity;\r\ntheir principles, firmness and popularity rendered them obnoxious to\r\ncertain persons amongst us, who have long been indulging themselves,\r\nin hopes of rearing up an American commonwealth, upon the ruin of\r\nthe British constitution. This republican party is of long standing;\r\nthey lay however, in a great measure, dormant for several years. The\r\ndistrust, jealousy and ferment raised by the stamp act, afforded\r\nscope for action. At first they wore the garb of hypocrisy, they\r\nprofessed to be friends to the British constitution in general, but\r\nclaimed some exemptions from their local circumstances; at length\r\nthrew off their disguise, and now stand confessed to the world in\r\ntheir true characters, American republicans. These republicans knew,\r\nthat it would be impossible for them to succeed in their darling\r\nprojects, without first destroying the influence of these adherents\r\nto the constitution. Their only method to accomplish it, was by\r\npublications charged with falshood and scurrility. Notwithstanding\r\nthe favorable opportunity the stamp act gave of imposing upon the\r\nignorant and credulous, I have sometimes been amazed, to see with\r\nhow little hesitation, some slovenly baits were swallowed. Sometimes\r\nthe adherents to the constitution were called ministerial tools, at\r\nothers, kings, lords and commons, were the tools of them; for almost\r\nevery act of parliament that has been made respecting America, in the\r\npresent reign, we were told was drafted in Boston, or its environs,\r\nand only sent to England to run through the forms of parliament. Such\r\nstories, however improbable, gained credit; even the fictitious bill\r\nfor restraining marriages and murdering bastard children, met with\r\nsome simple enough to think it real. He that readily imbibes such\r\nabsurdities, may claim affinity with the person mentioned by Mr.\r\nAddison, that made it his practice to swallow a chimera every morning\r\nfor breakfast. To be more serious, I pity the weakness of those that\r\nare capable of being thus duped, almost as much as I despise the\r\nwretch that would avail himself of it, to destroy private characters\r\nand the public tranquility. By such infamous methods, many of the\r\nancient, trusty and skilful pilots, who had steered the community\r\nsafely in the most perilous times, were driven from the helm, and\r\ntheir places occupied by different persons, some of whom, bankrupts\r\nin fortune, business and fame, are now striving to run the ship on\r\nthe rocks, that they may have an opportunity of plundering the wreck.\r\nThe gentlemen named by Novanglus, have nevertheless persevered with\r\nunshaken constancy and firmness, in their patriotic principles and\r\nconduct, through a variety of fortune; and have at present, the\r\nmournful consolation of reflecting, that had their admonitions and\r\ncouncils been timely attended to, their country would never have been\r\ninvolved in its present calamity.\r\n\r\nMASSACHUSETTENSIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESSED\r\n\r\n_To the Inhabitants of the Province of Massachusetts Bay_,\r\n\r\nMarch 13, 1775.\r\n\r\n\r\nMY DEAR COUNTRYMEN,\r\n\r\nOur patriotic writers, as they call each other, estimate the services\r\nrendered by, and the advantages resulting from the colonies to\r\nBritain, at a high rate, but allow but little, if any, merit in her\r\ntowards the colonies. Novanglus would persuade us that exclusive\r\nof her assistance in the last war, we have had but little of her\r\nprotection, unless it was such as her name alone afforded. Dr.\r\nFranklin when before the house of commons, in 1765, denied that the\r\nlate war was entered into for the defence of the people in America.\r\nThe Pennsylvania Farmer tells us in his letters, that the war was\r\nundertaken solely for the benefit of Great Britain, and that however\r\nadvantageous the subduing or keeping any of these countries, viz.\r\nCanada, Nova-Scotia and the Floridas may be to Great Britain, the\r\nacquisition is greatly injurious to these colonies. And that the\r\ncolonies, as constantly as streams tend to the ocean, have been\r\npouring the fruits of all their labours into their mother's lap.\r\nThus, they would induce us to believe, that we derive little or no\r\nadvantage from Great Britain, and thence they infer the injustice,\r\nrapacity and cruelty of her conduct towards us. I fully agree\r\nwith them, that the services rendered by the colonies are great\r\nand meritorious. The plantations are additions to the empire of\r\ninestimable value. The American market for British manufactures, the\r\ngreat nursery for seamen formed by our shipping, the cultivation of\r\ndeserts, and our rapid population, are increasing and inexhaustible\r\nsources of national wealth and strength. I commend these patriots\r\nfor their estimations of the national advantages accruing from\r\nthe colonies, as much as I think them deserving of censure for\r\ndepreciating the advantages and benefits that we derive from Britain.\r\nA particular inquiry into the protection afforded us, and the\r\ncommercial advantages resulting to us from the parent state, will\r\ngo a great way towards conciliating the affections of those whose\r\nminds are at present unduly impressed with different sentiments\r\ntowards Great Britain. The intestine commotions with which England\r\nwas convulsed and torn soon after the emigration of our ancestors,\r\nprobably prevented that attention being given to them in the earliest\r\nstages of this colony, that otherwise would have been given. The\r\nprincipal difficulties that the adventurers met with after the\r\nstruggle of a few of the first years were over, were the incursions\r\nof the French and savages conjointly, or of the latter instigated and\r\nsupported by the former. Upon a representation of this to England,\r\nin the time of the interregnum, Acadia, which was then the principal\r\nsource of our disquietude, was reduced by an English armament. At the\r\nrequest of this colony, in queen Ann's reign, a fleet of fifteen men\r\nof war, besides transports, troops, &c. were sent to assist us in an\r\nexpedition against Canada; the fleet suffered ship-wreck, and the\r\nattempt proved abortive. It ought not to be forgot, that the siege\r\nof Louisbourg, in 1745, by our own forces, was covered by a British\r\nfleet of ten ships, four of 60 guns, one of 50, and five of 40 guns,\r\nbesides the Vigilant of 64, which was taken during the siege, as\r\nshe was attempting to throw supplies into the garrison. It is not\r\nprobable that the expedition would have been undertaken without an\r\nexpectation of some naval assistance, or that the reduction could\r\nhave been effected without it. In January, 1754, our assembly, in a\r\nmessage to governor Shirley, prayed him to represent to the king,\r\n\"that the French had made such extraordinary encroachments, and\r\ntaken such measures, since the conclusion of the preceding war,\r\nas threatened great danger, and perhaps, in time, even the entire\r\ndestruction of this province, without the interposition of his\r\nmajesty, notwithstanding any provision we could make to prevent it.\"\r\n\"That the French had erected a fort on the isthmus of the peninsula\r\nnear Bay Vert in Nova Scotia, by means of which they maintained a\r\ncommunication by sea with Canada, St. John's Island and Louisbourg.\"\r\n\"That near the mouth of St. John's river, the French had possessed\r\nthemselves of two forts formerly built by them, one of which was\r\ngarrisoned by regular troops, and had erected another strong fort at\r\ntwenty leagues up the river, and that these encroachments might prove\r\nfatal not only to the eastern parts of his majesty's territories\r\nwithin this province, but also in time to the whole of this province,\r\nand the rest of his majesty's territories on this continent.\" \"That\r\nwhilst the French held Acadia under the treaty of St. Germain, they\r\nso cut off the trade of this province, and galled the inhabitants\r\nwith incursions into their territories, that OLIVER CROMWELL found\r\nit necessary for the safety of New England to make a descent by\r\nsea into the river of St. John, and dispossess them of that and\r\nall the forts in Acadia. That Acadia was restored to the French by\r\nthe treaty of Breda in 1667.\" That this colony felt again the same\r\nmischievous effects from their possessing it, insomuch, that after\r\nforming several expeditions against it, the inhabitants were obliged\r\nin the latter end of the war in queen Ann's reign, to represent to\r\nher majesty how destructive the possession of the bay of Fundy and\r\nNova Scotia, by the French, was to this province and the British\r\ntrade; whereupon the British ministry thought it necessary to fit\r\nout a _formal expedition against that province with English troops_,\r\nand a considerable armament of our own, under general Nicholson, by\r\nwhich it was again reduced to the subjection of the crown of Great\r\nBritain. \"That we were then, viz. in 1754, liable to feel more\r\nmischievous effects than we had ever yet done, unless his majesty\r\nshould be graciously pleased to cause them to be removed.\" They\r\nalso demonstrated our danger from the encroachments of the French\r\nat Crown Point. In April, 1754, the council and house represented,\r\n\"That it evidently appeared, that the French were so far advanced in\r\nthe execution of a plan projected more than fifty years since, for\r\nthe extending their possessions from the mouth of the Mississippi\r\non the south, to Hudson's Bay on the north, for securing the vast\r\nbody of Indians in that inland country, and for subjecting the whole\r\ncontinent to the crown of France.\" \"That many circumstances gave\r\nthem great advantages over us, which if not attended to, would soon\r\noverbalance our superiority of numbers; and that these advantages\r\ncould not be removed without his majesty's gracious interposition.\"\r\n\r\nThe assembly of Virginia, in an address to the king, represented,\r\n\"that the endeavours of the French to establish a settlement upon\r\nthe frontiers, was a high insult offered to his majesty, and if not\r\ntimely opposed, with vigor and resolution, must be attended with the\r\nmost fatal consequences,\" and prayed his majesty to extend his royal\r\nbeneficence towards them.\r\n\r\nThe commissioners who met at Albany the same year, represented, \"that\r\nit was the evident design of the French to surround the British\r\ncolonies; to fortify themselves on the back thereof; to take and keep\r\npossession of the heads of all the important rivers; to draw over the\r\nIndians to their interest, and with the help of such Indians, added\r\nto such forces as were then arrived, and might afterwards arrive, or\r\nbe sent from Europe, to be in a capacity of making a general attack\r\non the several governments; and if at the same time a strong naval\r\nforce should be sent from France, there was the utmost danger that\r\nthe whole continent would be subjected to the crown.\" \"That it seemed\r\nabsolutely necessary that speedy and effectual measures should be\r\ntaken to secure the colonies from the _slavery_ they were threatened\r\nwith.\"\r\n\r\nWe did not pray in vain. Great Britain, ever attentive to the _real\r\ngrievances_ of her colonies, hastened to our relief with maternal\r\nspeed. She covered our seas with her ships, and sent forth the\r\nbravest of her sons to fight our battles. They fought, they bled and\r\nconquered with us. Canada, Nova Scotia, the Floridas, and all our\r\nAmerican foes were laid at our feet. It was a dear bought victory;\r\nthe wilds of America were enriched with the blood of the noble and\r\nthe brave.\r\n\r\nThe war, which at our request, was thus kindled in America, spread\r\nthrough the four quarters of the globe, and obliged Great Britain to\r\nexert her whole force and energy to stop the rapid progress of its\r\ndevouring flames.\r\n\r\nTo these instances of actual exertions for our immediate protection\r\nand defence, ought to be added, the fleets stationed on our coast and\r\nthe convoys and security afforded to our trade and fishery, in times\r\nof war; and her maintaining in times of peace such a navy and army,\r\nas to be always in readiness to give protection as exigencies may\r\nrequire; and her ambassadors residing at foreign courts to watch and\r\ngive the earliest intelligence of their motions. By such precautions\r\nevery part of her wide extended empire enjoys as ample security as\r\nhuman power and policy can afford. Those necessary precautions are\r\nsupported at an immense expense, and the colonies reap the benefit\r\nof them equally with the rest of the empire. To these considerations\r\nit should likewise be added, that whenever the colonies have exerted\r\nthemselves in war, though in their own defence, to a greater degree\r\nthan their proportion with the rest of the empire, they have been\r\nreimbursed by parliamentary grants. This was the case, in the last\r\nwar, with this province.\r\n\r\nFrom this view, which I think is an impartial one, it is evident that\r\nGreat Britain is not less attentive to our interest than her own; and\r\nthat her sons that have settled on new and distant plantations are\r\nequally dear to her with those that cultivate the ancient domain, and\r\ninhabit the mansion house.\r\n\r\nMASSACHUSETTENSIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESSED\r\n\r\n_To the Inhabitants of the Province of Massachusetts Bay_,\r\n\r\nMarch 20, 1775.\r\n\r\n\r\nMY DEAR COUNTRYMEN,\r\n\r\nThe outlines of British commerce have been heretofore sketched; and\r\nthe interest of each part, in particular, and of the whole empire\r\nconjointly, have been shewn to be the principles by which the grand\r\nsystem is poized and balanced. Whoever will take upon himself the\r\ntrouble of reading and comparing the several acts of trade, which\r\nrespect the colonies, will be convinced, that the cherishing their\r\ntrade, and promoting their interest, have been the objects of\r\nparliamentary attention, equally with those of Britain. He will see,\r\nthat the great council of the empire has ever esteemed our prosperity\r\nas inseperable from the British, and if in some instances the\r\ncolonies have been restricted to the emolument of other parts of the\r\nempire, they, in their turn, not excepting England itself, have been\r\nalso restricted sufficiently to restore the balance, if not to cause\r\na preponderation in our favour.\r\n\r\nPermit me to transcribe a page or two from a pamphlet written in\r\nEngland, and lately republished here, wherein this matter is stated\r\nwith great justice and accuracy.\r\n\r\n\"The people of England and the American adventurers, being so\r\ndifferently circumstanced, it required no great sagacity to discover,\r\nthat as there were many commodities which America could supply on\r\nbetter terms than they could be raised in England, so must it be\r\nmuch more for the colonies, advantage to take others from England,\r\nthan attempt to make them themselves. The American lands were cheap,\r\ncovered with woods, and abounded with native commodities. The first\r\nattention of the settlers was necessarily engaged in cutting down\r\nthe timber, and clearing the ground for culture; for before they had\r\nsupplied themselves with provisions, and had hands to spare from\r\nagriculture, it was impossible they could set about manufacturing.\r\nEngland, therefore, undertook to supply them with manufactures,\r\nand either purchased herself or found markets for the timber the\r\ncolonists cut down upon their lands, or the fish they caught upon\r\ntheir coasts. It was soon discovered that the tobacco plant was a\r\nnative of and flourished in Virginia. It had been also planted in\r\nEngland, and was found to delight in the soil. The legislature,\r\nhowever, wisely and equitably considering that England had variety\r\nof products, and Virginia had no other to buy her necessaries with,\r\npassed an act prohibiting the people of England from planting\r\ntobacco, and thereby giving the monopoly of that plant to the\r\ncolonies. As the inhabitants increased, and the lands became more\r\ncultivated, further and new advantages were thrown in the way of the\r\nAmerican colonies. All foreign markets, as well as Great-Britain,\r\nwere open for their timber and provisions, and the British West-India\r\nislands were prohibited from purchasing those commodities from any\r\nother than them. And since England has found itself in danger of\r\nwanting a supply of timber, and it has been judged necessary to\r\nconfine the export from America to Great-Britain and Ireland, full\r\nand ample indemnity has been given to the colonies for the loss of a\r\nchoice of markets in Europe, by very large bounties paid out of the\r\nrevenue of Great Britain, upon the importation of American timber.\r\nAnd as a further encouragement and reward to them for clearing their\r\nlands, bounties are given upon tar and pitch, which are made from\r\ntheir decayed and useless trees; and the very ashes of their lops and\r\nbranches are made of value by the late bounty on American pot-ashes.\r\nThe soil and climate of the northern colonies having been found well\r\nadapted to the culture of flax and hemp, bounties, equal to half the\r\nfirst cost of those commodities, have been granted by parliament,\r\npayable out of the British revenue, upon their importation into Great\r\nBritain. The growth of rice in the southern colonies has been greatly\r\nencouraged, by prohibiting the importation of that grain into the\r\nBritish dominions from other parts, and allowing it to be transported\r\nfrom the colonies to the foreign territories in America, and even\r\nto the southern parts of Europe. Indigo has been nurtured in those\r\ncolonies by great parliamentary bounties, which have been long paid\r\nupon the importation into Great Britain; and of late are allowed to\r\nremain, even when it is carried out again to foreign markets. Silk\r\nand wine have also been objects of parliamentary munificence; and\r\nwill one day probably become considerable American products under\r\nthat encouragement. In which of these instances, it may be demanded,\r\nhas the legislature shown itself partial to the people of England and\r\nunjust to the colonies? Or wherein have the colonies been injured?\r\nWe hear much of the restraints under which the trade of the colonies\r\nis laid by acts of parliament for the advantage of Great Britain,\r\nbut the restraints under which the people of Great Britain are\r\nlaid by acts of parliament for the advantage of the colonies, are\r\ncarefully kept out of sight; and yet, upon a comparison the one will\r\nbe found full as grievous as the other. For is it a greater hardship\r\non the colonies, to be confined in some instances to the markets of\r\nGreat Britain for the sale of their commodities, than it is on the\r\npeople of Great Britain to be obliged to buy the commodities from\r\nthem only? If the island colonies are obliged to give the people of\r\nGreat Britain the pre-emption of their sugar and coffee, is it not\r\na greater hardship on the people of Great Britain to be restrained\r\nfrom purchasing sugar and coffee from other countries, where they\r\ncould get those commodities much cheaper than the colonies make them\r\npay for them? Could not our manufactures have indigo much better\r\nand cheaper from France and Spain than from Carolina? And yet is\r\nthere not a duty imposed by acts of parliament on French and Spanish\r\nindigo, that it may come to our manufacturers at a dearer rate than\r\nCarolina indigo, though a bounty is also given out of _the money_ of\r\nthe people of England to the Carolina planter, to enable him to sell\r\nhis indigo upon a _par_ with the French and Spanish? But the instance\r\nwhich has already been taken notice of, the act which prohibits\r\nthe culture of the tobacco plant in Great Britain or Ireland, is\r\nstill more in point, and a more striking proof of the justice and\r\nimpartiality of the supreme legislature; for what restraints, let\r\nme ask, are the colonies laid under, which bear so strong marks\r\nof hardship, as the prohibiting the farmers in Great Britain and\r\nIreland from raising upon their own lands, a product which is become\r\nalmost a necessary of life to them and their families? And this most\r\nextraordinary restraint is laid upon them, for the avowed and sole\r\npurpose of giving Virginia and Maryland a monopoly of that commodity,\r\nand obliging the people of Great Britain and Ireland to buy all the\r\ntobacco they consume, from them, at the prices they think fit to\r\nsell it for. The annals of no country, that ever planted colonies,\r\ncan produce such an instance as this of regard and kindness to\r\ntheir colonies, and of restraint upon the inhabitants of the mother\r\ncountry for their advantage. Nor is there any restraint laid upon\r\nthe inhabitants of the colonies in return, which carries with it so\r\ngreat appearance of hardships, although the people of Great Britain\r\nand Ireland have, from their regard and affection to the colonies,\r\nsubmitted to it without a murmur for near a century.\" For a more\r\nparticular inquiry, let me recommend the perusal of the pamphlet\r\nitself, also another pamphlet lately published, entitled, \"the\r\nadvantages which America derives from her commerce, connection and\r\ndependance on Great Britain.\"\r\n\r\nA calculation has lately been made both of the amount of the revenue\r\narising from the duties with which our trade is at present charged,\r\nand of the bounties and encouragement paid out of the British revenue\r\nupon articles of American produce imported into England, and the\r\nlatter is found to exceed the former more than four fold. This does\r\nnot look like a partiality to our disadvantage. However, there is no\r\nsurer method of determining whether the colonies have been oppressed\r\nby the laws of trade and revenue, than by observing their effects.\r\n\r\nFrom what source has the wealth of the colonies flowed? Whence is\r\nit derived? Not from agriculture only: exclusive of commerce the\r\ncolonists would this day have been a poor people, possessed of little\r\nmore than the necessaries for supporting life; of course their\r\nnumbers would be few; for population always keeps pace with the\r\nability of maintaining a family; there would have been but little or\r\nno resort of strangers here; the arts and sciences would have made\r\nbut small progress; the inhabitants would rather have degenerated\r\ninto a state of ignorance and barbarity. Or had Great Britain laid\r\nsuch restrictions upon our trade, as our patriots would induce us to\r\nbelieve, that is, had we been pouring the fruits of all our labour\r\ninto the lap of our parent and been enriching her by the sweat of our\r\nbrow, without receiving an equivalent, the patrimony derived from\r\nour ancestors must have dwindled from little to less, until their\r\nposterity should have suffered a general bankruptcy.\r\n\r\nBut how different are the effects of our connection with, and\r\nsubordination to Britain? They are too strongly marked to escape\r\nthe most careless observer. Our merchants are opulent, and our\r\nyeomanry in easier circumstances than the noblesse of some states.\r\nPopulation is so rapid as to double the number of inhabitants in the\r\nshort period of twenty-five years. Cities are springing up in the\r\ndepths of the wilderness. Schools, colleges, and even universities\r\nare interspersed through the continent; our country abounds with\r\nforeign refinements, and flows with exotic luxuries. These are\r\ninfallible marks not only of opulence but of freedom. The recluse\r\nmay speculate--the envious repine--the disaffected calumniate--all\r\nthese may combine to excite fears and jealousies in the minds of the\r\nmultitude, and keep them in alarm from the beginning to the end of\r\nthe year; but such evidence as this must for ever carry conviction\r\nwith it to the minds of the dispassionate and judicious.\r\n\r\nWhere are the traces of the slavery that our patriots would terrify\r\nus with? The effects of slavery are as glaring and obvious in those\r\ncountries that are cursed with its abode, as the effects of war,\r\npestilence or famine. Our land is not disgraced by the wooden shoes\r\nof France, or the uncombed hair of Poland: we have neither racks\r\nnor inquisitions, tortures or assassinations: the mildness of our\r\ncriminal jurisprudence is proverbial, \"_a man must have many friends\r\nto get hanged in New England_.\" Who has been arbitrarily imprisoned,\r\ndisseized of his freehold, or despoiled of his goods? Each peasant,\r\nthat is industrious, may acquire an estate, enjoy it in his life\r\ntime, and at his death, transmit a fair inheritance to his posterity.\r\nThe protestant religion is established, as far as human laws can\r\nestablish it. My dear friends, let me ask each one whether he has\r\nnot enjoyed every blessing, that is in the power of civil government\r\nto bestow? And yet the parliament has, from the earliest days of the\r\ncolonies, claimed the lately controverted right, both of legislation\r\nand taxation; and for more than a century has been in the actual\r\nexercise of it. There is no grievious exercise of that right at\r\nthis day, unless the measures taken to prevent our revolting, may\r\nbe called grievances. Are we, then, to rebel, lest there should be\r\ngrievances? Are we to take up arms and make war against our parent,\r\nlest that parent, contrary to the experience of a century and a half,\r\ncontrary to her own genius, inclination, affection and interest,\r\nshould treat us or our posterity as bastards and not as sons, and\r\ninstead of protecting should _enslave_ us? The annals of the world\r\nhave not yet been deformed with a single instance of so unnatural, so\r\ncausless, so wanton, so wicked a rebellion.\r\n\r\nThere is but a step between you and ruin: and should our patriots\r\nsucceed in their endeavours to urge you on to take that step, and\r\nhostilities actually commence, New England will stand recorded a\r\nsingular monument of human folly and wickedness. I beg leave to\r\ntranscribe a little from the Farmer's letters.--\"Good Heaven! Shall\r\na total oblivion of former tendernesses and blessings be spread over\r\nthe minds of a good and wise people by the sordid arts of intriguing\r\nmen, who covering their selfish projects under pretences of public\r\ngood, first enrage their countrymen into a frenzy of passion, and\r\nthen advance their own influence and interest by gratifying the\r\npassion, which they themselves have excited?\" When cool dispassionate\r\nposterity shall consider the affectionate intercourse, the reciprocal\r\nbenefits, and the unsuspecting confidence, that have subsisted\r\nbetween these colonies and their parent state, for such a length of\r\ntime, they will execrate, with the bitterest curses, the infamous\r\nmemory of those men whose ambition unnecessarily, wantonly, cruelly,\r\nfirst opened the sources of civil discord.\r\n\r\nMASSACHUSETTENSIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESSED\r\n\r\n_To the Inhabitants of the Province of Massachusetts Bay_,\r\n\r\nMarch 27, 1775.\r\n\r\n\r\nMY DEAR COUNTRYMEN,\r\n\r\nOur patriots exclaim, \"that humble and reasonable petitions from\r\nthe representatives of the people have been frequently treated with\r\ncontempt.\" This is as virulent a libel upon his majesty's government,\r\nas falshood and ingenuity combined could fabricate. Our humble and\r\nreasonable petitions have not only been ever graciously received,\r\nwhen the established mode of exhibiting them has been observed,\r\nbut generally granted. Applications of a different kind, have been\r\ntreated with neglect, though not always with the contempt they\r\ndeserved. These either originated in illegal assemblies, and could\r\nnot be received without implicitly countenancing such enormities, or\r\ncontained such matter, and were conceived in such terms, as to be at\r\nonce an insult to his majesty, and a libel on his government. Instead\r\nof being decent remonstrances against real grievances, or prayers for\r\ntheir removal, they were insidious attempts to wrest from the crown,\r\nor the supreme legislature, their inherent, unalienable prerogatives\r\nor rights.\r\n\r\nWe have a recent instance of this kind of petition, in the\r\napplication of the continental congress to the king, which starts\r\nwith these words: \"A standing army has been kept in these colonies\r\never since the conclusion of the late war, _without the consent\r\nof our assemblies_.\" This is a denial of the king's authority to\r\nstation his military forces in such parts of the empire, as his\r\nmajesty may judge expedient for the common safety. They might with\r\nequal propriety have advanced one step further, and denied its being\r\na prerogative of the crown to declare war, or conclude a peace, by\r\nwhich the colonies should be affected, without the consent of our\r\nassemblies. Such petitions carry the marks of death in their faces,\r\nas they cannot be granted but by surrendering some constitutional\r\nright at the same time; and therefore afford grounds for suspicion at\r\nleast, that they were never intended to be granted, but to irritate\r\nand provoke the power petitioned to. It is one thing to remonstrate\r\nthe inexpediency or inconveniency of a particular act of the\r\nprerogative, and another to deny the existence of the prerogative. It\r\nis one thing to complain of the inutility or hardship of a particular\r\nact of parliament, and quite another to deny the authority of\r\nparliament to make any act. Had our patriots confined themselves to\r\nthe former, they would have acted a part conformable to the character\r\nthey assumed, and merited the encomiums they arrogate.\r\n\r\nThere is not one act of parliament that respects us, but would have\r\nbeen repealed, upon the legislators being convinced, that it was\r\noppressive; and scarcely one, but would have shared the same fate,\r\nupon a representation of its being generally disgustful to America.\r\nBut, by adhering to the latter, our politicians have ignorantly or\r\nwilfully betrayed their country. Even when Great Britain has relaxed\r\nin her measures, or appeared to recede from her claims, instead of\r\nmanifestations of gratitude, our politicians have risen in their\r\ndemands, and sometimes to such a degree of insolence, as to lay the\r\nBritish government under a necessity of persevering in its measures\r\nto preserve its honour.\r\n\r\nIt was my intention, when I began these papers, to have minutely\r\nexamined the proceedings of the continental congress, as the\r\ndelegates appear to me to have given their country a deeper wound,\r\nthan any of their predecessors had inflicted, and I pray God it\r\nmay not prove an incurable one; but am in some measure anticipated\r\nby Grotius, Phileareine, and the many pamphlets that have been\r\npublished; and shall therefore confine my observations to some of its\r\nmost striking and characteristic features.\r\n\r\nA congress or convention of committees from the several colonies,\r\nconstitutionally appointed by the supreme authority of the state,\r\nor by the several provincial legislatures, amenable to, and\r\ncontroulable by the power that convened them, would be salutary\r\nin many supposeable cases. Such was the convention of 1754; but a\r\ncongress otherwise appointed, must be an unlawful assembly, wholly\r\nincompatible with the constitution, and dangerous in the extreme,\r\nmore especially as such assemblies will ever chiefly consist of\r\nthe most violent partizans. The prince, or sovereign, as some\r\nwriters call the supreme authority of a state, is sufficiently\r\nample and extensive to provide a remedy for every wrong, in all\r\npossible emergencies and contingencies; consequently a power, that\r\nis not derived from such authority, springing up in a state, must\r\nencroach upon it, and in proportion as the usurpation enlarges\r\nitself, the rightful prince must be diminished; indeed, they cannot\r\nlong subsist together, but must continually militate, till one or\r\nthe other be destroyed. Had the continental congress consisted of\r\ncommittees from the several houses of assembly, although destitute\r\nof the consent of the several governors, they would have had some\r\nappearance of authority; but many of them were appointed by other\r\ncommittees, as illegally constituted as themselves. However, at so\r\ncritical and delicate a juncture, Great Britain being alarmed with\r\nan apprehension, that the colonies were aiming at independence on\r\nthe one hand, and the colonies apprehensive of grievous impositions\r\nand exactions from Great Britain on the other; many real patriots\r\nimagined, that a congress might be eminently serviceable, as they\r\nmight prevail on the Bostonians to make restitution to the East\r\nIndia company, might still the commotions in this province, remove\r\nany ill-founded apprehensions respecting the colonies, and propose\r\nsome plan for a cordial and permanent reconciliation, which might be\r\nadopted by the several assemblies, and make its way through them to\r\nthe supreme legislature. Placed in this point of light, many good men\r\nviewed it with an indulgent eye, and tories, as well as whigs, bade\r\nthe delegates God speed.\r\n\r\nThe path of duty was too plain to be overlooked; but unfortunately\r\nsome of the most influential of the members were the very persons\r\nthat had been the _wilful_ cause of the evils they were expected to\r\nremedy. Fishing in troubled waters had long been their business and\r\ndelight; and they deprecated nothing more than that the storm they\r\nhad blown up, should subside. They were old in intrigue, and would\r\nhave figured in a conclave. The subtility, hypocrisy, cunning, and\r\nchicanery, habitual to such men, were practised with as much success\r\nin this, as they had been before in other popular assemblies.\r\n\r\nSome of the members, of the first rate abilities and characters,\r\nendeavoured to confine the deliberations and resolves of the congress\r\nto the design of its institution, which was \"to restore peace,\r\nharmony, and mutual confidence,\" but were obliged to succumb to the\r\nintemperate zeal of some, and at length were so circumvented and\r\nwrought upon by the artifice and duplicity of others, as to lend\r\nthe sanction of their names to such measures, as they condemned in\r\ntheir hearts. _Vide_ a pamphlet published by one of the delegates,\r\nentitled, \"A candid examination, &c.\"\r\n\r\nThe congress could not be ignorant of what every body else knew, that\r\ntheir appointment was repugnant to, and inconsistent with every idea\r\nof government, and therefore wisely determined to destroy it. Their\r\nfirst essay that transpired, and which was matter of no less grief to\r\nthe friends of our country, than of triumph to its enemies, was the\r\never memorable resolve approbating and adopting the Suffolk resolves,\r\nthereby undertaking to give a continental sanction to a forcible\r\nopposition to acts of parliament, shutting up the courts of justice,\r\nand thereby abrogating all human laws, seizing the king's provincial\r\nrevenue, raising forces in opposition to the king's, and all the\r\ntumultuary violence, with which this unhappy province had been rent\r\nasunder.\r\n\r\nThis fixed the complexion, and marked the character of the congress.\r\nWe were, therefore, but little surprized, when it was announced, that\r\nas far as was in their power, they had dismembered the colonies from\r\nthe parent country. This they did by resolving, that \"the colonists\r\nare entitled to an exclusive power of legislation in their several\r\nprovincial legislatures.\" This stands in its full force, and is\r\nan absolute denial of the authority of parliament respecting the\r\ncolonies.\r\n\r\nTheir subjoining that, \"_from necessity_ they consent to the\r\n_operation_ (not the authority) of such acts of the _British_\r\nparliament, as _are_ (not shall be) _bona fide_ restrained to\r\nexternal commerce,\" is so far from weakening their first principle,\r\nthat it strengthens it, and is an adoption of the acts of trade. This\r\nresolve is a manifest revolt from the British empire. Consistent with\r\nit, is their overlooking the supreme legislature, and addressing the\r\ninhabitants of Great Britain, in the style of a manifesto, in which\r\nthey flatter, complain, coax, and threaten alternately; and their\r\nprohibiting all commercial intercourse between the two countries:\r\nwith equal propriety and justice the congress might have declared\r\nwar against Great Britain; and they intimate that they might justly\r\ndo it, and actually shall, if the measures already taken prove\r\nineffectual. For in the address to the colonies, after attempting\r\nto enrage their countrymen by every colouring and heightning in the\r\npower of language, to the utmost pitch of frenzy, they say, \"the\r\nstate of these colonies would certainly justify _other_ measures\r\nthan we have advised; we were inclined to offer _once more_ to\r\nhis _majesty_ the petition of his faithful and oppressed subjects\r\nin America,\" and admonish the colonists to extend their views to\r\n_mournful events_, and to be in all respects prepared for every\r\ncontingency.\r\n\r\nThis is treating Great Britain as an alien enemy; and if Great\r\nBritain be such, it is justifiable by the law of nations. But their\r\nattempt to alienate the affections of the inhabitants of the new\r\nconquered province of Quebec from his majesty's government, is\r\naltogether unjustifiable, even upon that principle. In the truly\r\njesuitical address to the Canadians, the congress endeavour to\r\nseduce them from their allegiance, and prevail on them to join the\r\nconfederacy. After insinuating that they had been tricked, duped,\r\noppressed and enslaved by the Quebec bill, the congress exclaim,\r\nwhy this degrading distinction? \"Have not Canadians sense enough\r\nto attend to any other public affairs, than gathering stones from\r\none place and piling them up in another? Unhappy people; who are\r\nnot only injured but _insulted_.\" \"Such a treacherous ingenuity\r\nhas been exerted, in drawing up the code lately offered you, that\r\nevery sentence, beginning with a benevolent pretention, concludes\r\nwith a destructive power; and the substance of the whole divested\r\nof its smooth words, is that the _crown_ and its ministers shall be\r\nas absolute throughout your extended province, as the _despots of\r\nAsia or Africa_. We defy you, casting your view upon every side,\r\nto discover a single circumstance promising, from any quarter, the\r\nfaintest hope of liberty to you or your posterity, but from an entire\r\nadoption into the union of these colonies.\" The treachery of the\r\ncongress in this address is the more flagrant, by the Quebec bill's\r\nhaving been adapted to the genius and manners of the Canadians,\r\nformed upon their own petition, and received with every testimonial\r\nof gratitude. The public tranquility has been often disturbed by\r\ntreasonable plots and conspiracies. Great Britain has been repeatedly\r\ndeluged by the blood of its slaughtered citizens, and shaken to its\r\ncentre by rebellion. To offer such aggravated insult to British\r\ngovernment was reserved for _the grand continental congress_. None\r\nbut ideots or madmen could suppose such measures had a tendency to\r\nrestore \"union and harmony between Great Britain and the colonies.\"\r\nNay! The very demands of the congress evince, that that was not in\r\ntheir intention. Instead of confining themselves to those acts, which\r\noccasioned the misunderstanding, they demand a repeal of fourteen,\r\nand bind the colonies by a law not to trade with Great Britain, until\r\nthat shall be done. Then, and not before, the colonists are to treat\r\nGreat Britain as an alien friend, and in no other light is the parent\r\ncountry ever after to be viewed; for the parliament is to surcease\r\nenacting laws to respect us forever. These demands are such as cannot\r\nbe complied with, consistent with either the honor or interest of\r\nthe empire, and are therefore insuperable obstacles to a union _via_\r\ncongress.\r\n\r\nThe delegates erecting themselves into the states general or supreme\r\nlegislature of all the colonies, from _Nova Scotia_ to _Georgia_,\r\ndoes not leave a doubt respecting their aiming, in good earnest,\r\nat independency: this they did by enacting laws. Although they\r\nrecognize the authority of the several provincial legislatures,\r\nyet they consider their own authority as paramount or supreme;\r\notherwise they would not have acted decisively, but submitted their\r\nplans to the final determination of the assemblies. Sometimes\r\nindeed they use the terms request and recommend; at others they\r\nspeak in the style of authority. Such is the resolve of the 27th of\r\nSeptember: \"Resolved from and after the first day of December next,\r\nthere be no importation into British America from Great Britain\r\nor Ireland of any goods, wares or merchandize whatsoever, or from\r\nany other place of any such goods, wares or merchandize, as shall\r\nhave been exported from Great Britain or Ireland, and that no such\r\ngoods, wares or merchandize imported, after the said first day of\r\nDecember next, be used or purchased.\" October 15, the congress\r\nresumed the consideration of the plan for carrying into effect the\r\nnon-importation, &c. October 20, the plan is compleated, determined\r\nupon, and ordered to be subscribed by all the members: they call\r\nit an association, but it has all the constituent parts of a law.\r\nThey begin, \"We his majesty's most loyal subjects the delegates\r\nof the several colonies of, &c. deputed to _represent them_ in a\r\ncontinental congress,\" and agree for themselves and the inhabitants\r\nof the several colonies whom they represent, not to import, export\r\nor consume, &c. as also to observe several sumptuary regulations\r\nunder certain penalties and forfeitures, and that a committee be\r\nchosen in every county, city and town, by those who are qualified\r\nto vote for representatives in the legislature, to see that the\r\nassociation be observed and kept, and to punish the violators of it;\r\nand afterwards, \"recommend it to the provincial conventions, and to\r\nthe committees in the respective colonies to establish such further\r\nregulations, as they may think proper, for carrying into execution\r\nthe association.\" Here we find the congress enacting laws, that is,\r\nestablishing, as the representatives of the people, certain rules\r\nof conduct to be observed and kept by all the inhabitants of these\r\ncolonies, under certain pains and penalties, such as masters of\r\nvessels being dismissed from their employment; goods to be seized and\r\nsold at auction, and the first cost only returned to the proprietor,\r\na different appropriation made of the overplus; persons being\r\nstigmatized in the gazette, as enemies to their country, and excluded\r\nthe benefits of society, &c.\r\n\r\nThe congress seem to have been apprehensive that some squeamish\r\npeople might be startled at their assuming the powers of legislation,\r\nand therefore, in the former part of their association say, they\r\nbind themselves and constituents under the sacred ties of virtue,\r\nhonor, and love to their country, afterwards establish penalties\r\nand forfeitures, and conclude by solemnly binding themselves and\r\nconstituents under the ties aforesaid, which include them all. This\r\nlooks like artifice: but they might have spared themselves that\r\ntrouble; for every law is or ought to be made under the sacred ties\r\nof virtue, honor and a love to the country, expressed or implied,\r\nthough the penal sanction be also necessary. In short, were the\r\ncolonies distinct states, and the powers of legislation vested in\r\ndelegates thus appointed, their association would be as good a form\r\nof enacting laws as could be devised.\r\n\r\nBy their assuming the powers of legislation, the congress have not\r\nonly superseded our provincial legislatures, but have excluded every\r\nidea of monarchy; and not content with the havock already made in our\r\nconstitution, in the plenitude of their power, have appointed another\r\ncongress to be held in May.\r\n\r\nThose, that have attempted to establish new systems, have generally\r\ntaken care to be consistent with themselves. Let us compare the\r\nseveral parts of the continental proceedings with each other.\r\n\r\nThe delegates call themselves and constituents \"his majesty's most\r\nloyal subjects,\" his majesty's most faithful subjects affirm, that\r\nthe colonists are entitled \"to all the immunities and privileges\r\ngranted and confirmed to them by royal charters,\" declare that they\r\n\"wish not a diminution of the prerogative, nor solicit the grant\r\nof any new right or favour,\" and they \"shall always carefully and\r\nzealously endeavour to support his royal authority and our connection\r\nwith Great Britain;\" yet deny the king's prerogative to station\r\ntroops in the colonies, disown him in the capacity in which he\r\ngranted the provincial charters; disclaim the authority of the king\r\nin parliament; and undertake to enact and execute laws without any\r\nauthority derived from the crown. This is dissolving all connection\r\nbetween the colonies and the crown, and giving us a new king,\r\naltogether incomprehensible, not indeed from the infinity of his\r\nattributes, but from a privation of every royal prerogative, and not\r\nleaving even a semblance of a connection with Great Britain.\r\n\r\nThey declare, that the colonists \"are entitled to all the rights,\r\nliberties and immunities of free and natural born subjects within\r\nthe realm of England,\" and \"all the benefits secured to the subject\r\nby the English constitution,\" but disclaim all obedience to British\r\ngovernment; in other words, they claim the protection, and disclaim\r\nthe allegiance. They remonstrate as a grievance that \"both houses of\r\nparliament have resolved that the colonists may be tried in England\r\nfor offences, alleged to have been committed in America, by virtue of\r\na statute passed in the thirty-fifth year of Henry the eighth; and\r\nyet resolve that they are entitled to the benefit of such English\r\nstatutes, as existed at the time of their colonization, and are\r\napplicable to their several local and other circumstances.\" They\r\nresolve that the colonists are entitled to a free and _exclusive_\r\npower of legislation in their several provincial assemblies; yet\r\nundertake to legislate in congress.\r\n\r\nThe immutable laws of nature, the principles of the English\r\nconstitution, and our several charters are the basis, upon which they\r\npretend to found themselves, and complain more especially of being\r\ndeprived of trials by juries; but establish ordinances incompatible\r\nwith either the laws of nature, the English constitution, or our\r\ncharter; and appoint committees to punish the violaters of them, not\r\nonly without a jury, but even without a form of trial.\r\n\r\nThey repeatedly complain of the Roman Catholic religion being\r\nestablished in Canada; and in their address to the Canadians, ask,\r\n\"If liberty of conscience be offered them _in their religion_ by the\r\nQuebec bill,\" and answer, \"no: God gave it to you and the temporal\r\npowers, with which you have been and are connected, firmly stipulated\r\nfor your enjoyment of it. If laws, _divine_ and _human_, could secure\r\nit against the despotic caprices of wicked men, it was secured\r\nbefore.\"\r\n\r\nThey say to the people of Great Britain, \"place us in the same\r\nsituation, that we were in, at the close of the last war, and our\r\nharmony will be restored.\" Yet some of the principal grievances,\r\nwhich are to be redressed, existed long before that era, viz. The\r\nking's keeping a standing army in the colonies; judges of admiralty\r\nreceiving their fees, &c. from the effects condemned by themselves;\r\ncounsellors holding commissions during pleasure, exercising\r\nlegislative authority; and the capital grievance of all, the\r\nparliament claiming and exercising over the colonies a right both of\r\nlegislation and taxation. However the wisdom of the grand continental\r\ncongress may reconcile these seeming inconsistencies.\r\n\r\nHad the delegates been appointed to devise means to irritate and\r\nenrage the inhabitants of the two countries, against each other,\r\nbeyond a possibility of reconciliation, to abolish our equal system\r\nof jurisprudence, and establish a judicatory as arbitrary, as the\r\nRomish inquisition, to perpetuate animosities among ourselves, to\r\nreduce thousands from affluence to poverty and indigence, to injure\r\nGreat Britain, Ireland, the West Indies, and these colonies, to\r\nattempt a revolt from the authority of the empire, and finally to\r\ndraw down upon the colonies the whole vengeance of Great Britain;\r\nmore promising means to effect the whole could not have been devised\r\nthan those the congress adopted. Any deviation from their plan would\r\nhave been treachery to their constituents, and an abuse of the trust\r\nand confidence reposed in them. Some idolaters have attributed to\r\nthe congress the collected wisdom of the continent. It is as near\r\nthe truth to say, that every particle of disaffection, petulance,\r\ningratitude, and disloyalty, that for ten years past have been\r\nscattered through the continent, were united and consolidated in\r\nthem. Are these thy Gods, O Israel!\r\n\r\nMASSACHUSETTENSIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESSED\r\n\r\n_To the Inhabitants of the Province of Massachusetts Bay_,\r\n\r\nApril 3, 1775.\r\n\r\n\r\nMY DEAR COUNTRYMEN,\r\n\r\nThe advocates for the opposition to parliament often remind us of\r\nthe rights of the people, repeat the Latin adage _vox populi vox\r\nDei_, and tell us that government in the dernier resort is in the\r\npeople; they chime away melodiously, and to render their music more\r\nravishing, tell us, that these are _revolution_ principles. I hold\r\nthe rights of the people as sacred, and revere the principles, that\r\nhave established the succession to the imperial Crown of Great\r\nBritain, in the line of the illustrious house of Brunswick; but that\r\nthe difficulty lies in applying them to the cause of the whigs, _hic\r\nlabor hoc opus est_; for admitting that the collective body of the\r\npeople, that are subject to the British empire, have an inherent\r\nright to change their form of government, or race of kings, it does\r\nnot follow, that the inhabitants of a single province, or of a number\r\nof provinces, or any given part under a majority of the whole empire,\r\nhave such a right. By admitting that the less may rule or sequester\r\nthemselves from the greater, we unhinge all government. Novanglus\r\nhas accused me of traducing the people of this province. I deny the\r\ncharge. Popular demagogues always call themselves the people, and\r\nwhen their own measures are censured, cry out, the people, the people\r\nare abused and insulted. He says, that I once entertained different\r\nsentiments from those now advanced. I did not write to exculpate\r\nmyself. If through ignorance, inadvertence or design, I have\r\nheretofore contributed in any degree, to the forming that destructive\r\nsystem of politics that is now in vogue, I was under the greater\r\nobligation thus publicly to expose its errors, and point out its\r\npernicious tendency. He suggests, that I write from sordid motives.\r\nI despise the imputation. I have written my real sentiments not to\r\nserve a party (for, as he justly observes, I have sometimes quarreled\r\nwith my friends) but to serve the public; nor would I injure my\r\ncountry to inherit all the treasures that avarice and ambition sigh\r\nfor. Fully convinced, that our calamities were chiefly created by the\r\nleading whigs, and that a persevering in the same measures that gave\r\nrise to our troubles would complete our ruin, I have written freely.\r\nIt is painful to me to give offence to an individual, but I have\r\nnot spared the ruinous policy of my brother or my friend; they are\r\nboth far advanced. Truth, from its own energy, will finally prevail;\r\nbut to have a speedy effect, it must sometimes be accompanied with\r\nseverity. The terms whig and tory have been adopted according to\r\nthe arbitrary use of them in this province, but they rather ought\r\nto be reversed; an American tory is a supporter of our excellent\r\nconstitution, and an American whig a subverter of it.\r\n\r\nNovanglus abuses me, for saying, that the whigs aim at independence.\r\nThe writer from Hampshire county is my advocate. He frankly asserts\r\nthe independency of the colonies without any reserve; and is the\r\nonly consistent writer I have met with on that side of the question.\r\nFor by separating us from the king as well as the parliament, he\r\nis under no necessity of contradicting himself. Novanglus strives\r\nto hide the inconsistencies of his hypothesis, under a huge pile\r\nof learning. Surely he is not to learn, that arguments drawn from\r\nobsolete maxims, raked out of the ruins of the feudal system, or from\r\nprinciples of absolute monarchy, will not conclude to the present\r\nconstitution of government. When he has finished his essays, he may\r\nexpect some particular remarks upon them. I should not have taken\r\nthe trouble of writing these letters, had I not been satisfied that\r\nreal and permanent good would accrue to this province, and indeed to\r\nall the colonies, from a speedy change of measures. Public justice\r\nand generosity are no less characteristic of the English, than their\r\nprivate honesty and hospitality. The total repeal of the stamp act,\r\nand the partial repeal of the act imposing duties on paper, &c. may\r\nconvince us that the nation has no disposition to injure us. We\r\nare blessed with a king that reflects honor upon a crown. He is so\r\nfar from being avaricious, that he has relinquished a part of his\r\nrevenue; and so far from being tyrannical, that he has generously\r\nsurrendered part of his prerogative for the sake of freedom. His\r\ncourt is so far from being tinctured with dissipation, that the\r\npalace is rather an academy of the literati, and the royal pair\r\nare as exemplary in every private virtue, as they are exalted in\r\ntheir stations. We have only to cease contending with the supreme\r\nlegislature, respecting its authority, with the king respecting his\r\nprerogatives, and with Great Britain respecting our subordination;\r\nto dismiss our illegal committees, disband our forces, despise\r\nthe thraldom _arrogant congresses_, and submit to constitutional\r\ngovernment, to be happy.\r\n\r\nMany appear to consider themselves as _procul a Jove a fulmine\r\nprocul_; and because we never have experienced any severity from\r\nGreat Britain, think it impossible that we should. The English\r\nnation will bear much from its friends; but whoever has read its\r\nhistory must know, that there is a line that cannot be passed with\r\nimpunity. It is not the fault of our patriots if that line be not\r\nalready passed. They have demanded of Great Britain more than she can\r\ngrant, consistent with honor, her interest, or our own, and are now\r\nbrandishing the sword of defiance.\r\n\r\nDo you expect to conquer in war? War is no longer a simple, but an\r\nintricate science, not to be learned from books or two or three\r\ncampaigns, but from long experience. You need not be told that his\r\nmajesty's generals, Gage and Haldimand, are possessed of every talent\r\nrequisite to great commanders, matured by long experience in many\r\nparts of the world, and stand high in military fame: that many of\r\nthe officers have been bred to arms from their infancy, and a large\r\nproportion of the army _now_ here, have already reaped immortal\r\nhonors in the iron harvest of the field.--Alas! My friends, you have\r\nnothing to oppose to this force, but a militia unused to service,\r\nimpatient of command, and destitute of resources. Can your officers\r\ndepend upon the privates, or the privates upon the officers? Your war\r\ncan be but little more than mere tumultuary rage: and besides, there\r\nis an awful disparity between troops that fight the battles of their\r\nsovereign, and those that follow the standard of rebellion. These\r\nreflections may arrest you in an hour that you think not of, and come\r\ntoo late to serve you. Nothing short of a miracle could gain you one\r\nbattle; but could you destroy all the British troops that are now\r\nhere, and burn the men of war that command our coast, it would be\r\nbut the beginning of sorrow; and yet without a decisive battle, one\r\ncampaign would ruin you. This province does not produce its necessary\r\nprovision, when the husbandman can pursue his calling without\r\nmolestation: what then must be your condition, when the demand\r\nshall be increased, and the resource in a manner cut off? Figure to\r\nyourselves what must be your distress, should your wives and children\r\nbe driven from such places, as the king's troops shall occupy, into\r\nthe interior parts of the province, and they as well as you, be\r\ndestitute of support. I take no pleasure in painting these scenes\r\nof distress. The whigs affect to divert you from them by ridicule;\r\nbut should war commence, you can expect nothing but its severities.\r\nMight I hazard an opinion, but few of your leaders ever intended\r\nto engage in hostilities, but they may have rendered inevitable\r\nwhat they intended for intimidation. Those that unsheath the sword\r\nof rebellion may throw away the scabbard, they cannot be treated\r\nwith, while in arms; and if they lay them down, they are in no other\r\npredicament than conquered rebels. The conquered in other wars do not\r\nforfeit the rights of men, nor all the rights of citizens, even their\r\nbravery is rewarded by a generous victor; far different is the case\r\nof a routed rebel host. My dear countrymen, you have before you, at\r\nyour election, peace or war, happiness or misery. May the God of our\r\nforefathers direct you in the way that leads to peace and happiness,\r\nbefore your feet stumble on the dark mountains, before the evil days\r\ncome, wherein you shall say, we have no pleasure in them.\r\n\r\nMASSACHUSETTENSIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTERS\r\n\r\nFROM THE\r\n\r\nHON. JOHN ADAMS,\r\n\r\nTO THE\r\n\r\nHON. WM. TUDOR, AND OTHERS,\r\n\r\nON THE\r\n\r\nEVENTS OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE EDITOR OF THE WEEKLY REGISTER.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Quincy_, _January_ 14, 1818.\r\n\r\nMR. NILES,\r\n\r\nIn a former letter I hazarded an opinion, that the true history of\r\nthe American revolution could not be recovered. I had many reasons\r\nfor that apprehension; one of which I will attempt to explain.\r\n\r\nOf the determination of the British cabinet to assert and maintain\r\nthe sovereign authority of parliament over the colonies, in all\r\ncases of taxation and internal policy, the first demonstration which\r\narrived in America was an _order in council_ to the officers of the\r\ncustoms in Massachusetts Bay, to carry into execution _the acts of\r\ntrade_, and to apply to the supreme judicature of the province for\r\n_writs of assistance_, to authorise them to break and enter all\r\nhouses, cellars, stores, shops, ships, bales, casks, &c. to search\r\nand seize all goods, wares, and merchandizes, on which the taxes\r\nimposed by those acts had not been paid.\r\n\r\nMr. Cockle, of Salem, a deputy under Mr. Paxton, of Boston,\r\nthe collector of the customs, petitioned the superior court in\r\nSalem, in November, 1760, for such a writ. The court doubted its\r\nconstitutionality, and consequently its legality; but as the king's\r\norder ought to be considered, they ordered the question to be argued\r\nbefore them, by counsel, at the next February term in Boston.\r\n\r\nThe community was greatly alarmed. The merchants of Salem and of\r\nBoston, applied to Mr. Otis to defend them and their country, against\r\nthat formidable instrument of arbitrary power. They tendered him rich\r\nfees; he engaged in their cause, but would accept no fees.\r\n\r\nJAMES OTIS, of Boston, sprung from families among the earliest of the\r\nplanters of the colonies, and the most respectable in rank, while the\r\nword rank, and the idea annexed to it, were tolerated in America.\r\nHe was a gentleman of general science, and extensive literature. He\r\nhad been an indefatigable student during the whole course of his\r\neducation in college, and at the bar. He was well versed in Greek\r\nand Roman history, philosophy, oratory, poetry, and mythology, His\r\nclassical studies had been unusually ardent, and his acquisitions\r\nuncommonly great. He had composed a treatise on Latin prosody,\r\nwhich he lent to me, and I urged him to print. He consented. It is\r\nextant, and may speak for itself. It has been lately reviewed in\r\nthe Anthology by one of our best scholars, at a mature age, and in\r\na respectable station. He had also composed, with equal skill and\r\ngreat labour, a treatise on Greek prosody. This he also lent me,\r\nand, by his indulgence, I had it in my possession six months. When I\r\nreturned it, I begged him to print it. He said there were no Greek\r\ntypes in the country, or, if there were, there was no printer who\r\nknew how to use them. He was a passionate admirer of the Greek poets,\r\nespecially of Homer; and he said it was in vain to attempt to read\r\nthe poets in any language, without being master of their prosody.\r\nThis classic scholar was also a great master of the laws of nature\r\nand nations. He had read Puffendorph, Grotius, Barbeyrac, Burlamaqui,\r\nVattel, Heineccius; and, in the civil law, Domal, Justinian, and,\r\nupon occasions, consulted the _corpus juris_ at large. It was a maxim\r\nwhich he inculcated on his pupils, as his patron in profession, Mr.\r\nGridley, had done before him, \"_that a lawyer ought never to be\r\nwithout a volume of natural or public law, or moral philosophy, on\r\nhis table, or in his pocket_.\" In the history, the common law, and\r\nstatute laws of England, he had no superior, at least in Boston.\r\n\r\nThus qualified to resist the system of usurpation and despotism,\r\nmeditated by the British ministry, under the auspices of the earl of\r\nBute, Mr. Otis resigned his commission from the crown, as advocate\r\ngeneral, an office very lucrative at that time, and a sure road to\r\nthe highest favours of government in America, and engaged in the\r\ncause of his country without fee or reward. His argument, speech,\r\ndiscourse, oration, harangue--call it by which name you will, was the\r\nmost impressive upon his crowded audience of any, that I ever heard\r\nbefore or since, excepting only many speeches by himself in Faneuil\r\nHall, and in the House of Representatives, which he made from time to\r\ntime, for ten years afterwards. There were no stenographers in those\r\ndays. Speeches were not printed; and all that was not remembered,\r\nlike the harangues of Indian orators, was lost in air. Who, at the\r\ndistance of fifty seven years, would attempt, upon memory, to give\r\neven a sketch of it. Some of the heads are remembered, out of which\r\nLivy or Sallust would not scruple to compose an oration for history.\r\nI shall not essay an analysis or a sketch of it, at present. I shall\r\nonly essay an analysis or a sketch of it, at present. [Transcriber's\r\nNote: This last sentence appears to be a printer error.] I shall only\r\nsay, and I do say in the most solemn manner, that Mr. Otis's oration,\r\nagainst _writs of assistance_, breathed into this nation the breath\r\nof life.\r\n\r\nAlthough Mr. Otis had never before interfered in public affairs,\r\nhis exertions, on this single occasion, secured him a commanding\r\npopularity with the friends of their country, and the terror and\r\nvengeance of her enemies; neither of which ever deserted him.\r\n\r\nAt the next election, in May, 1761, he was elected, by a vast\r\nmajority, a representative in the legislature, of the town of Boston,\r\nand continued to be so elected annually for nine years. Here, at\r\nthe head of the country interest, he conducted her cause with a\r\nfortitude, prudence, ability and perseverance which has never been\r\nexceeded in America, at every sacrifice of health, pleasure, profit\r\nand reputation, and against all the powers of government, and all the\r\ntalents, learning, wit, scurrility and insolence of its prostitutes.\r\n\r\nHampden was shot in open field of battle. Otis was basely\r\nassassinated in a coffee house, in the night, by a well dressed\r\nbanditti, with a commissioner of the customs at their head.\r\n\r\nDuring the period of nine years, that Mr. Otis was at the head of\r\nthe cause of his country, he held correspondence with gentlemen in\r\nEngland, Scotland and various colonies in America. He must have\r\nwritten and received many letters, collected many pamphlets, and,\r\nprobably, composed manuscripts, which might have illustrated the\r\nrising dawn of the revolution.\r\n\r\nAfter my return from Europe, I asked his daughter whether she had\r\nfound among her father's manuscripts, a treatise on Greek prosody?\r\nWith hands and eyes uplifted, in a paroxysm of grief, she cried, \"Oh!\r\nsir, I have not a line from my father's pen. I have not even his name\r\nin his own hand writing.\" When she was a little calmed, I asked her,\r\n\"Who has his papers? Where are they?\" She answered, \"They are no\r\nmore. In one of those unhappy dispositions of mind, which distressed\r\nhim after his great misfortune, and a little before his death, he\r\ncollected all his papers and pamphlets and committed them to the\r\nflames.--He was several days employed in it.\"\r\n\r\nI cannot enlarge. I submit this hint to your reflections. Enclosed\r\nis a morsel of verse, written soon after Mr. Otis's death, by a very\r\nyoung gentleman, who is now one of our excellent magistrates. If you\r\ndo not think fit to print this letter and that verse, I pray you to\r\nreturn them to\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_On the death of_ JAMES OTIS, _killed by lightning, at\r\nAndover, soon after the peace of 1783, written at the time._\r\n\r\n     When flush'd with conquest and elate with pride,\r\n     Britannia's monarch Heaven's high will defy'd;\r\n     And, bent on blood, by lust of rule inclin'd,\r\n     With odious chains to vex the freeborn mind;\r\n     On these young shores set up unjust command,\r\n     And spread the _slaves of office_ round the land;\r\n     Then OTIS rose, and, great in patriot fame,\r\n     To list'ning crowds _resistance_ dar'd proclaim.\r\n     From soul to soul the bright idea ran,\r\n     The fire of freedom flew from man to man,\r\n     His pen, like _Sidney's_, made the doctrine known,\r\n     His tongue, like _Tully's_, shook a tyrant's throne.\r\n     Then men grew bold, and, in the public eye,\r\n     _The right divine of monarchs dar'd to try_;\r\n     Light shone on all, despotic darkness fled--\r\n     And for a SENTIMENT a nation bled.\r\n     From men, like OTIS, INDEPENDENCE grew,\r\n     From such beginnings empire rose to view.\r\n     Born for the world, his comprehensive mind\r\n     Scann'd the wide politics of human kind:\r\n     Bless'd with a native strength and fire of thought,\r\n     With Greek and Roman learning richly fraught,\r\n     Up to the fountain head he push'd his view,\r\n     And from first principles his maxims drew.\r\n     'Spite of the times, this truth he blaz'd abroad,\r\n     \"The people's safety is the law of GOD.\"[2]\r\n     For this he suffered; hireling slaves combin'd\r\n     To dress in shades the brightest of mankind.\r\n     And see they come, a dark designing band,\r\n     With Murder's heart and Execution's hand.\r\n     Hold, villains! Those polluted hands restrain;\r\n     Nor that exalted head with blows profane!\r\n     A nobler end awaits his patriot head;\r\n     In other sort he'll join the illustrious dead.\r\n     Yes! when the glorious work which he begun,\r\n     Shall stand the most complete beneath the sun--\r\n     When peace shall come to crown the grand design,\r\n     His eyes shall live to see the work divine.--\r\n     The Heavens shall then his generous spirit claim,\r\n     \"In storms as loud as his immortal fame.\"[3]\r\n     Hark!--the deep thunders echo round the skies!\r\n     On wings of flame the eternal errand flies.\r\n     One chosen, charitable bolt is sped,\r\n     And OTIS mingles with the glorious dead.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Salus populi_, was the motto of one of his essays.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Waller, on the death of Cromwell.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SAME.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Quincy_, _February_ 13, 1818.\r\n\r\nMR. NILES,\r\n\r\nThe American Revolution was not a common event. Its effects and\r\nconsequences have already been awful over a great part of the globe.\r\nAnd when and where are they to cease?\r\n\r\nBut what do we mean by the American revolution? Do we mean the\r\nAmerican war? The revolution was effected before the war commenced.\r\nThe revolution was in the minds and hearts of the people. A change in\r\ntheir religious sentiments, of their duties and obligations. While\r\nthe king, and all in authority under him, were believed to govern\r\nin justice and mercy according to the laws and constitution derived\r\nto them from the God of nature, and transmitted to them by their\r\nancestors--they thought themselves bound to pray for the king and\r\nqueen and all the royal family, and all in authority under them; as\r\nministers ordained of God for their good. But when they saw those\r\npowers renouncing all the principles of authority, and bent upon\r\nthe destruction of all the securities of their lives, liberties and\r\nproperties, they thought it their duty to pray for the continental\r\ncongress and all the thirteen state congresses, &c.\r\n\r\nThere might be, and there were others, who thought less about\r\nreligion and conscience, but had certain habitual sentiments of\r\nallegiance and loyalty derived from their education; but believing\r\nallegiance and protection to be reciprocal, when protection was\r\nwithdrawn, they thought allegiance was dissolved.\r\n\r\nAnother alteration was common to all. The people of America had\r\nbeen educated in an habitual affection for England as their mother\r\ncountry; and while they thought her a kind and tender parent\r\n(erroneously enough, however, for she never was such a mother) no\r\naffection could be more sincere. But when they found her a cruel\r\nBeldam, willing like lady Macbeth, to \"dash their brains out,\" it is\r\nno wonder if their filial affections ceased and were changed into\r\nindignation and horror.\r\n\r\n_This radical change in the principles, opinions, sentiments and\r\naffections of the people, was the real American revolution._\r\n\r\nBy what means, this great and important alteration in the religious,\r\nmoral, political and social character of the people of thirteen\r\ncolonies, all distinct, unconnected and independent of each other,\r\nwas begun, pursued and accomplished, it is surely interesting to\r\nhumanity to investigate, and perpetuate to posterity.\r\n\r\nTo this end it is greatly to be desired that young gentlemen of\r\nletters in all the states, especially in the thirteen original\r\nstates, would undertake the laborious, but certainly interesting and\r\namusing task, of searching and collecting all the records, pamphlets,\r\nnewspapers, and even handbills, which in any way contributed to\r\nchange the temper and views of _the people_ and compose them into an\r\nindependent nation.\r\n\r\nThe colonies had grown up under constitutions of government so\r\ndifferent, there was so great a variety of religions, they were\r\ncomposed of so many different nations, their customs, manners and\r\nhabits had so little resemblance, and their intercourse had been\r\nso rare and their knowledge of each other so imperfect, that to\r\nunite them in the same principles in theory and the same system of\r\naction, was certainly a very difficult enterprise. The complete\r\naccomplishment of it, in so short a time and by such simple means,\r\nwas perhaps a singular example in the history of mankind. Thirteen\r\nclocks were made to strike together; a perfection of mechanism which\r\nno artist had ever before effected.\r\n\r\nIn this research, the glorioles of individual gentlemen and of\r\nseparate states is of little consequence. The _means and the\r\nmeasures_ are the proper objects of investigation. These may be of\r\nuse to posterity, not only in this nation, but in South America and\r\nall other countries. They may teach mankind that revolutions are no\r\ntrifles, that they ought never to be undertaken rashly; nor without\r\ndeliberate consideration and sober reflection; nor without a solid,\r\nimmutable, eternal foundation of justice and humanity; nor without a\r\npeople possessed of intelligence, fortitude and integrity sufficient\r\nto carry them with steadiness, patience, and perseverance, through\r\nall the vicissitudes of fortune, the fiery trials and melancholy\r\ndisasters they may have to encounter.\r\n\r\nThe town of Boston early instituted an annual oration on the fourth\r\nof July, in commemoration of the principles and feelings which\r\ncontributed to produce the revolution. Many of those orations I have\r\nheard, and all that I could obtain I have read. Much ingenuity and\r\neloquence appears upon every subject, except those principles and\r\nfeelings. That of my honest and amiable neighbour, Josiah Quincy,\r\nappeared to me the most directly to the purpose of the institution.\r\nThose principles and feelings ought to be traced back for two\r\nhundred years, and sought in the history of the country from the\r\nfirst plantations in America. Nor should the principles and feelings\r\nof the English and Scotch towards the colonies, through that whole\r\nperiod ever be forgotten. The perpetual discordance between British\r\nprinciples and feelings and of those of America, the next year after\r\nthe suppression of the French power in America, came to a crisis, and\r\nproduced an explosion.\r\n\r\nIt was not until after the annihilation of the French dominion in\r\nAmerica, that any British ministry had dared to gratify their own\r\nwishes, and the desire of the nation, by projecting a formal plan for\r\nraising a national revenue from America, by parliamentary taxation.\r\nThe first great manifestation of this design was by the order to\r\ncarry into strict exertions those acts of parliament which were well\r\nknown by the appellation of the _acts of trade_, which had lain a\r\ndead letter, unexecuted for a half a century, and some of them, I\r\nbelieve, for nearly a whole one.\r\n\r\nThis produced, in 1760 and 1761, _an awakening_ and a _revival_ of\r\nAmerican principles and feelings, with an enthusiasm which went on\r\nincreasing, till in 1775 it burst out in open violence, hostility and\r\nfury.\r\n\r\nThe characters, the most conspicuous, the most ardent and influential\r\nin this revival, from 1760 to 1766, were, first and foremost, before\r\nall and above all, James Otis; next to him was Oxenbridge Thatcher;\r\nnext to him, Samuel Adams; next to him, John Hancock; then Dr.\r\nMayhew; then Dr. Cooper and his brother. Of Mr. Hancock's life,\r\ncharacter, generous nature, great and disinterested sacrifices, and\r\nimportant services, if I had forces, I should be glad to write a\r\nvolume. But this I hope will be done by some younger and abler hand.\r\nMr. Thatcher, because his name and merits are less known, must not\r\nbe wholly omitted.--This gentleman was an eminent barrister at law,\r\nin as large practice as any one in Boston. There was not a citizen\r\nof that town more universally beloved for his learning, ingenuity,\r\nevery domestic and social virtue, and conscientious conduct in every\r\nrelation of life. His patriotism was as ardent as his progenitors\r\nhad been ancient and illustrious in this country. Hutchinson often\r\nsaid, \"Thatcher was not born a plebeian, but he was determined to die\r\none.\" In May, 1763, I believe, he was chosen by the town of Boston\r\none of their representatives in the legislature, a colleague with\r\nMr. Otis, who had been a member from May 1761, and he continued to\r\nbe re-elected annually till his death in 1765, when Mr. Samuel Adams\r\nwas elected to fill his place, in the absence of Mr. Otis, then\r\nattending the congress at New York. Thatcher had long been jealous\r\nof the unbounded ambition of Mr. Hutchinson, but when he found him\r\nnot content with the office of lieut. governor, the command of the\r\ncastle and its emoluments, of judge of probate for the county of\r\nSuffolk, a seat in his majesty's council in the legislature, his\r\nbrother in-law secretary of state by the king's commission, a brother\r\nof that secretary of state, a judge of the supreme court and a member\r\nof council, now in 1760 and 1761, soliciting and accepting the office\r\nof chief justice of the superior court of judicature, he concluded,\r\nas Mr. Otis did, and as every other enlightened friend of his country\r\ndid, that he sought that office with the determined purpose of\r\ndetermining all causes in favor of the ministry at St. James's, and\r\ntheir servile parliament.\r\n\r\nHis indignation against him henceforward, to 1765, when he died,\r\nknew no bounds but truth. I speak from personal knowledge. For,\r\nfrom 1758 to 1765, I attended every superior and inferior court in\r\nBoston, and recollect not one, in which he did not invite me home\r\nto spend evenings with him, when he made me converse with him as\r\nwell as I could, on all subjects of religion, morals, law, politics,\r\nhistory, philosophy, belles lettres, theology, mythology, cosmogony,\r\nmetaphysics,--Lock, Clark, Leibnits, Bolingbroke, Berckley,--the\r\npre-established harmony of the universe, the nature of matter and of\r\nspirit, and the eternal establishment of coincidences between their\r\noperations, fate, foreknowledge, absolute; and we reasoned on such\r\nunfathomable subjects as high as Milton's gentry in pandemonium; and\r\nwe understood them as well as they did, and no better. To such mighty\r\nmysteries he added the news of the day, and the tittle tattle of\r\nthe town. But his favourite subject was politics, and the impending\r\nthreatening system of parliamentary taxation and universal government\r\nover the colonies. On this subject he was so anxious and agitated\r\nthat I have no doubt it occasioned his premature death. From the\r\ntime when he argued the question of writs of assistance, to his\r\ndeath he considered the king, ministry, parliament and nation of G.\r\nB. as determined to new model the colonies from the foundation; to\r\nannul all their charters, to constitute them all royal governments;\r\nto raise a revenue in America by parliamentary taxation; to apply\r\nthat revenue to pay the salaries of governours, judges and all other\r\ncrown officers; and, after all this, to raise as large a revenue as\r\nthey pleased, to be applied to national purposes at the exchequer\r\nin England; and further to establish bishops and the whole system\r\nof the church of England, tythes and all, throughout all British\r\nAmerica. This system, he said, if it was suffered to prevail, would\r\nextinguish the flame of liberty all over the world; that America\r\nwould be employed as an engine to batter down all the miserable\r\nremains of liberty in Great Britain and Ireland, where only any\r\nsemblance of it was left in the world. To this system he considered\r\nHutchinson, the Olivers and all their connections, dependants,\r\nadherents, shoelickers, &c. entirely devoted. He asserted that they\r\nwere all engaged with all the crown officers in America and the\r\nunderstrappers of the ministry in England, in a deep and treasonable\r\nconspiracy to betray the liberties of their country, for their own\r\nprivate, personal and family aggrandizement. His philippicks against\r\nthe unprincipled ambition and avarice of all of them, but especially\r\nof Hutchinson, were unbridled; not only in private, confidential\r\nconversations, but in all companies and on all occasions. He gave\r\nHutchinson the sobriquet of \"Summa Potestatis,\" and rarely mentioned\r\nhim but by the name of \"Summa.\" His liberties of speech were no\r\nsecrets to his enemies. I have sometimes wondered that they did not\r\nthrow him over the bar, as they did soon afterwards major Hawley.\r\nFor they hated him worse than they did James Otis, or Samuel Adams,\r\nand they feared him more, because they had no revenge for a father's\r\ndisappointment of a seat on the superior bench to impute to him, as\r\nthey did to Otis; and Thatcher's character through life had been so\r\nmodest, decent, unassuming; his morals so pure, and his religion\r\nso venerated, that they dared not attack him. In his office were\r\neducated to the bar, two eminent characters, the late judge Lowell,\r\nand Josiah Quincy, aptly called the Boston Cicero. Mr. Thatcher's\r\nframe was slender, his constitution delicate; whether his physicians\r\noverstrained his vessels with mercury, when he had the small pox by\r\ninoculation at the castle, or whether he was overplied by public\r\nanxieties and exertions, the small pox left him in a decline from\r\nwhich he never recovered. Not long before his death he sent for me\r\nto commit to my care some of his business at the bar. I asked him\r\nwhether he had seen the Virginia resolves: \"Oh yes--they are men!\r\nthey are noble spirits! It kills me to think of the lethargy and\r\nstupidity that prevails here. I long to be out. I will go out. I will\r\ngo out. I will go into court, and make a speech which shall be read\r\nafter my death, as my dying testimony against this infernal tyranny\r\nwhich they are bringing upon us.\" Seeing the violent agitation into\r\nwhich it threw him, I changed the subject as soon as possible, and\r\nretired. He had been confined for some time. Had he been abroad\r\namong the people, he would not have complained so pathetically of\r\nthe \"lethargy and stupidity that prevailed,\" for town and country\r\nwere all alive; and in August became active enough, and some of the\r\npeople proceeded to unwarrantable excesses, which were more lamented\r\nby the patriots than by their enemies. Mr. Thatcher soon died, deeply\r\nlamented by all the friends of their country.\r\n\r\nAnother gentleman, who had great influence in the commencement of\r\nthe revolution, was doctor Jonathan Mayhew, a descendant of the\r\nancient governor of Martha's Vineyard. This divine had raised a great\r\nreputation both in Europe and America, by the publication of a volume\r\nof seven sermons in the reign of king George the second, 1749, and by\r\nmany other writings, particularly a sermon in 1750, on the thirtieth\r\nof January, on the subject of passive obedience and non-resistance;\r\nin which the saintship and martyrdom of king Charles the first are\r\nconsidered, seasoned with wit and satire superior to any in Swift or\r\nFranklin. It was read by every body; celebrated by friends and abused\r\nby enemies. During the reigns of king George the first and king\r\nGeorge the second, the reigns of the Stuarts, the two Jameses and the\r\ntwo Charleses, were in general disgrace in England. In America they\r\nhad always been held in abhorrence. The persecutions and cruelties\r\nsuffered by their ancestors under those reigns, had been transmitted\r\nby history and tradition, and Mayhew seemed to be raised up to revive\r\nall their animosities against tyranny, in church and state, and at\r\nthe same time to destroy their bigotry, fanaticism and inconsistency.\r\nDavid Hume's plausible, elegant, fascinating and fallacious apology,\r\nin which he varnished over the crimes of the Stuarts, had not then\r\nappeared. To draw the character of Mayhew would be to transcribe a\r\ndozen volumes. This transcendant genius threw all the weight of his\r\ngreat fame into the scale of his country in 1761, and maintained it\r\nthere with zeal and ardor till his death in 1766. In 1763 appeared\r\nthe controversy between him and Mr. Apthorp, Mr. Caner, Dr. Johnson\r\nand archbishop Secker, on the charter and conduct of the society for\r\npropagating the gospel in foreign parts. To form a judgment of this\r\ndebate I beg leave to refer to a review of the whole, printed at the\r\ntime and written by Samuel Adams, though by some, very absurdly\r\nand erroneously, ascribed to Mr. Apthorp. If I am not mistaken, it\r\nwill be found a model of candor, sagacity, impartiality, and close,\r\ncorrect reasoning.\r\n\r\nIf any gentleman supposes this controversy to be nothing to the\r\npresent purpose, he is grossly mistaken. It spread an universal alarm\r\nagainst the authority of parliament. It excited a general and just\r\napprehension, that bishops and diocesses and churches, and priests,\r\nand tythes, were to be imposed on us by parliament. It was known,\r\nthat neither king, nor ministry, nor archbishops, could appoint\r\nbishops, in America, without an act of parliament, and if parliament\r\ncould tax us, they could establish the church of England, with all\r\nits creeds, articles, tests, ceremonies, and tythes, and prohibit all\r\nother churches, as conventicles, and schism shops.\r\n\r\nNor must Mr. Cushing be forgotten. His good sense and sound judgment,\r\nthe urbanity of his manners, his universal good character, his\r\nnumerous friends and connections, and his continual intercourse\r\nwith all sorts of people, added to his constant attachment to the\r\nliberties of his country, gave him a great and salutary influence\r\nfrom the beginning in 1760.\r\n\r\nLet me recommend these hints to the consideration of Mr. Wirt, whose\r\nlife of Mr. Henry I have read with great delight. I think that after\r\nmature investigation, he will be convinced, that Mr. Henry did not\r\n\"give the first impulse to the ball of independence,\" and that Otis,\r\nThatcher, Samuel Adams, Mayhew, Hancock, Cushing, and thousands of\r\nothers, were labouring for several years at the wheel, before the\r\nname of Henry was heard beyond the limits of Virginia.\r\n\r\nIf you print this, I will endeavour to send you something concerning\r\nSamuel Adams, who was destined to a longer career, and to act a more\r\nconspicuous, and perhaps a more important part than any other man.\r\nBut his life would require a volume. If you decline printing this\r\nletter, I pray you to return it as soon as possible to,\r\n\r\nSir, Your humble servant,\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. WIRT.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Quincy_, _January_ 5, 1818.\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nYour sketches of the life of Mr. Henry have given me a rich\r\nentertainment. I will not compare them to the Sybil, conducting Æneas\r\nto see the ghosts of departed sages and heroes in the region below,\r\nbut to an angel, convoying me to the abodes of the blessed on high,\r\nto converse with the spirits of just men made perfect. The names of\r\nHenry, Lee, Bland, Pendleton, Washington, Rutledge, Dickinson, Wythe,\r\nand many others, will ever thrill through my veins with an agreeable\r\nsensation. I am not about to make any critical remarks upon your\r\nworks, at present. But, sir,\r\n\r\n     Erant heroes ante Agamemnona multi.\r\n     Or, not to garble Horace,\r\n     Vixere fortes ante Agamemnona\r\n     Multi: sed omnes illacrimabiles\r\n     Urgentur, ignotique longa\r\n     Nocte, carent quia vate sacro.\r\n\r\nIf I could go back to the age of thirty five, Mr. Wirt, I would\r\nendeavour to become your rival; not in elegance of composition, but\r\nin a simple narration of facts, supported by records, histories,\r\nand testimonies, of irrefragable authority. I would adopt, in all\r\nits modesty, your title, \"Sketches of the life and writings of\r\nJames Otis, of Boston.\" And, in imitation of your example, I would\r\nintroduce portraits of a long catalogue of illustrious men, who were\r\nagents in the revolution, in favor of it or against it.\r\n\r\nJeremiah Gridley, the father of the bar in Boston, and the preceptor\r\nof Pratt, Otis, Thatcher, Cushing, and many others; Benjamin Pratt,\r\nchief justice of New-York; colonel John Tynge, James Otis, of Boston,\r\nthe hero of the biography; Oxenbridge Thatcher, Jonathan Sewall,\r\nattorney general and judge of admiralty; Samuel Quincy, solicitor\r\ngeneral; Daniel Leonard, now chief justice of Bermuda; Josiah Quincy,\r\nthe Boston Cicero; Richard Dana and Francis Dana, his son, first\r\nminister to Russia, and afterwards chief justice; Jonathan Mayhew, D.\r\nD. Samuel Cooper, D. D. Charles Chauncey, D. D. James Warren and his\r\nwife; Joseph Warren, of Bunker's Hill; John Winthrop, professor at\r\nHarvard college, and a member of council; Samuel Dexter, the father;\r\nJohn Worthington, of Springfield; Joseph Hawley, of Northampton,\r\nand James Lovel, of Boston; governors Shirley, Pownal, Bernard,\r\nHutchinson, Hancock, Bowdoin, Adams, Sullivan, and Gerry; lieutenant\r\ngovernor Oliver, chief justice Oliver, judge Edmund Trowbridge, judge\r\nWilliam Cushing, and Timothy Ruggles, ought not to be omitted. The\r\nmilitary characters, Ward, Lincoln, Warren, Knox, Brooks, Heath, &c.\r\nmust come in of course. Nor should Benjamin Kent, Samuel Swift, or\r\nJohn Reed, be forgotten.\r\n\r\nI envy none of the well merited glories of Virginia, or any of her\r\nsages or heroes. But, sir, I am jealous, very jealous, of the honour\r\nof Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nThe resistance to the British system, for subjugating the colonies,\r\nbegan in 1760, and in the month of February, 1761, James Otis\r\nelectrified the town of Boston, the province of Massachusetts bay,\r\nand the whole continent, more than Patrick Henry ever did in the\r\nwhole course of his life. If we must have panegyrics and hyperboles,\r\nI must say, that if Mr. Henry was Demosthenes, and Mr. Richard Henry\r\nLee, Cicero, James Otis was Isaiah and Ezekiel UNITED.\r\n\r\nI hope, sir, that some young gentleman, of the ancient and honourable\r\nfamily of \"The Searchers,\" will hereafter do impartial justice, both\r\nto Virginia and Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nAfter all this freedom, I assure you, sir, it is no flattery, when I\r\ncongratulate the nation on the acquisition of an attorney general of\r\nsuch talents and industry as your \"Sketches\" demonstrate.\r\n\r\nWith great esteem, I am, Sir,\r\n\r\nYour friend and humble servant,\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n_Mr._ WIRT, _Attorney General of the United States._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SAME.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Quincy_, _January_ 23, 1819.\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nI thank you for your kind letter of the 12th of this month. As I\r\nesteem the character of Mr. Henry, an honour to our country, and your\r\nvolume a masterly delineation of it, I gave orders to purchase it as\r\nsoon as I heard of it, but was told it was not to be had in Boston.\r\nI have seen it only by great favour on a short loan. A copy from the\r\nauthor would be worth many by purchase. It may be sent to me by the\r\nmail.\r\n\r\nFrom a personal acquaintance, perhaps I might say a friendship,\r\nwith Mr. Henry, of more than forty years, and from all that I have\r\nheard or read of him, I have always considered him as a gentleman of\r\ndeep reflection, keen sagacity, clear foresight, daring enterprise,\r\ninflexible intrepidity, and untainted integrity; with an ardent zeal\r\nfor the liberties, the honour, and felicity of his country, and his\r\nspecies. All this, you justly as I believe, represent him to have\r\nbeen. There are, however, remarks to be made upon your work, which,\r\nif I had the eyes and hands, I would, in the spirit of friendship,\r\nattempt. But my hands, and eyes, and life, are but for a moment.\r\n\r\nWhen congress had finished their business, as they thought, in the\r\nautumn of 1774, I had, with Mr. Henry, before we took leave of each\r\nother, some familiar conversation, in which I expressed a full\r\nconviction, that our resolves, declarations of rights, enumeration of\r\nwrongs, petitions, remonstrances, and addresses, associations, and\r\nnon-importation agreements, however they might be expected [Errata:\r\nrespected] in America, and however necessary to cement the union of\r\nthe colonies, would be but waste water in England. Mr. Henry said,\r\nthey might make some impression among the people of England, but\r\nagreed with me that they would be totally lost upon the government.\r\nI had but just received a short and hasty letter, written to me by\r\nmajor Joseph Hawley, of Northampton, containing \"a few broken hints,\"\r\nas he called them, of what he thought was proper to be done, and\r\nconcluding with these words, \"_after all we must fight_.\" This letter\r\nI read to Mr. Henry, who listened with great attention; and as soon\r\nas I had pronounced the words, \"after all we must fight,\" he raised\r\nhis head, and with an energy and vehemence that I can never forget,\r\nbroke out with \"BY G--D, I AM OF THAT MAN'S MIND.\" I put\r\nthe letter into his hand, and when he had read it, he returned it to\r\nme, with an equally solemn asseveration, that he agreed entirely in\r\nopinion with the writer. I considered this as a sacred oath, upon a\r\nvery great occasion, and could have sworn it as religiously as he\r\ndid, and by no means inconsistent with what you say, in some part of\r\nyour book, that he never took the sacred name in vain.\r\n\r\nAs I knew the sentiments with which Mr. Henry left congress, in the\r\nautumn of 1774, and knew the chapter and verse from which he had\r\nborrowed the sublime expression, \"we must fight,\" I was not at all\r\nsurprised at your history, in the 122d page, in the note, and in some\r\nof the preceding and following pages. Mr. Henry only pursued, in\r\nMarch, 1775, the views and vows of November, 1774.\r\n\r\nThe other delegates from Virginia returned to their state in full\r\nconfidence, that all our grievances would be redressed. The last\r\nwords that Mr. Richard Henry Lee said to me, when we parted, were,\r\n\"_we shall infallibly carry all our points. You will be completely\r\nrelieved; all the offensive acts will be repealed; the army and fleet\r\nwill be recalled, and Britain will give up her foolish project_.\"\r\n\r\nWashington only was in doubt, He never spoke in public. In private\r\nhe joined with those who advocated a non-exportation, as well as a\r\nnon-importation agreement. With both he thought we should prevail;\r\nwithout either, he thought it doubtful, Henry was clear in one\r\nopinion, Richard Henry Lee in an opposite opinion, and Washington\r\ndoubted between the two. Henry, however, appeared in the end to be\r\nexactly in the right.\r\n\r\nOratory, Mr. Wirt, as it consists in expressions of the countenance,\r\ngraces of attitude and motion, and intonation of voice, although\r\nit is altogether superficial and ornamental, will always command\r\nadmiration, yet it deserves little veneration. Flashes of wit,\r\ncoruscations of imagination and gay pictures, what are they? Strict\r\ntruth, rapid reason and pure integrity are the only essential\r\ningredients in sound oratory. I flatter myself, that Demosthenes, by\r\nhis \"action! action! action!\" meant to express the same opinion. To\r\nspeak of American oratory, ancient or modern, would lead me too far,\r\nand beyond my depth.\r\n\r\nI must conclude with fresh assurances of the high esteem of your\r\nhumble servant,\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n  WILLIAM WIRT, Esq.\r\n    _Attorney General of the United States._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE HON. WM. TUDOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Quincy_, _February_ 25, 1818.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Wirt has filled my head with James Otis, and as I am well\r\ninformed, that the honourable Mr. ******** *****, alias ********,\r\nalias *** *****, &c. roundly asserts, that Mr. \"Otis had no\r\npatriotism,\" and that \"he acted only from revenge of his father's\r\ndisappointment of a seat at the Superior Bench,\" I will tell you a\r\nstory which may make you laugh, if it should not happen to melt you\r\ninto tears.\r\n\r\nOtis belonged to a club, who met on evenings, of which club William\r\nMolineux, whose character you know very well, was a member. Molineux\r\nhad a petition before the legislature, which did not succeed to his\r\nwishes, and he became for several evenings sour, and wearied the\r\ncompany with his complaints of services, losses, sacrifices, &c. and\r\nsaid, \"that a man who has behaved as I have, should be treated as\r\nI am, is intolerable,\" &c. Otis had said nothing, but the company\r\nwere disgusted and out of patience, when Otis rose from his seat,\r\nand said, \"come, come, Will, quit this subject, and let us enjoy\r\nourselves. I also have a list of grievances, will you hear it?\" The\r\nclub expected some fun, and all cried out, \"Aye! Aye! let us hear\r\nyour list.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, Will; in the first place I resigned the office of\r\nadvocate general, which I held from the crown which produced me; how\r\nmuch, do you think?\" \"A great deal, no doubt,\" said Molineux. \"Shall\r\nwe say two hundred sterling a year?\" \"Aye, more I believe,\" said\r\nMolineux. \"Well, let it be 200; that for ten years is two thousand.\r\nIn the next place, I have been obliged to relinquish the greatest\r\npart of my business at the bar. Will you set that at 200 more?\" \"Oh\r\nI believe it much more than that.\" \"Well let it be 200. This for\r\nten years makes two thousand. You allow, then, I have lost 4000_l._\r\nsterling.\" \"Aye, and more too,\" said Molineux.\r\n\r\n\"In the next place, I have lost an hundred friends; among whom were\r\nthe men of the first rank, fortune and power in the province. At\r\nwhat price will you estimate them?\" \"Damn them,\" said Molineux, \"at\r\nnothing. You are better without them than with them.\" A loud laugh.\r\n\"Be it so,\" said Otis.\r\n\r\n\"In the next place, I have made a thousand enemies; amongst whom are\r\nthe government of the province and the nation. What do you think of\r\nthis item?\" \"That is as it may happen,\" said Molineux.\r\n\r\n\"In the next place, you know I love pleasure. But I have renounced\r\nall amusement for ten years. What is that worth to a man of\r\npleasure?\" \"No great matter,\" said Molineux, \"you have made politics\r\nyour amusement.\" A hearty laugh.\r\n\r\n\"In the next place, I have ruined as fine health and as good\r\na constitution of body, as nature ever gave to man.\" \"This is\r\nmelancholy indeed,\" said Molineux. \"There is nothing to be said upon\r\nthat point.\"\r\n\r\n\"Once more,\" said Otis, holding his head down before Molineux, \"look\r\nupon this head!\" (where was a scar in which a man might bury his\r\nfinger.) \"What do you think of this? And what is worse, my friends\r\nthink I have a monstrous crack in my scull.\" This made all the\r\ncompany very grave, and look very solemn. But Otis setting up a\r\nlaugh, and with a gay countenance, said to Molineux, \"Now, Willy, my\r\nadvice to you is, to say no more about your grievances; for you and I\r\nhad better put up our accounts of profit and loss in our pockets, and\r\nsay no more about them, lest the world should laugh at us.\"\r\n\r\nThis whimsical dialogue put all the company, and Molineux himself\r\ninto good humour, and they passed the rest of the evening in joyous\r\nconviviality.\r\n\r\nIt is provoking, and it is astonishing, and it is mortifying, and it\r\nis humiliating to see, how calumny sticks, and is transmitted from\r\nage to age. Mr. ****** is one of the last men I should have expected\r\nto have swallowed that execrable lie, that Otis had no patriotism.\r\nThe father was refused an office worth 1200_l._ old tenor, or about\r\n120_l._ sterling, and the refusal was no loss, for his practice\r\nat the bar was worth much more; for Colonel Otis was a lawyer in\r\nprofitable practice, and his seat in the legislature gave him more\r\npower and more honour; for this refusal the son resigned an office\r\nwhich he held from the crown, worth twice the sum. The son must have\r\nbeen a most dutiful and affectionate child to the father. Or rather,\r\nmost enthusiastically and frenzically affectionate.\r\n\r\nI have been young, and now am old, and I solemnly say, I have never\r\nknown a man whose love of his country was more ardent or sincere;\r\nnever one, who suffered so much; never one, whose services for any\r\nten years of his life, were so important and essential to the cause\r\nof his country, as those of Mr. Otis from 1760 to 1770.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, he was an honest man, and a thorough taught lawyer.\r\nHe was called upon in his official capacity as advocate general by\r\nthe custom house officers, to argue their cause in favour of writs\r\nof assistants. These writs he knew to be illegal, unconstitutional,\r\ndestructive of the liberties of his country; a base instrument of\r\narbitrary power, and intended as an entering wedge to introduce\r\nunlimited taxation and legislation by authority of parliament. He\r\ntherefore scorned to prostitute his honour and his conscience, by\r\nbecoming a tool. And he scorned to hold an office which could compel\r\nhim or tempt him to be one. He therefore resigned it. He foresaw as\r\nevery other enlightened man foresaw, a tremendous storm coming upon\r\nhis country, and determined to run all risques, and share the fate of\r\nthe ship, after exerting all his energies to save her, if possible.\r\nAt the solicitation of Boston and Salem, he accordingly embarked and\r\naccepted the command.\r\n\r\nTo attribute to such a character sinister or trivial motives is\r\nridiculous. You and Mr. Wirt have \"brought the old man out,\" and I\r\nfear he will never be driven in again, till he falls into the grave.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE HON. WM. TUDOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Quincy_, _March_ 29, 1818.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nIs your daughter, Mrs. ******, who I am credibly informed, is one\r\nof the most accomplished ladies, a painter? Are you acquainted with\r\nMiss ***** *****, who I am also credibly informed is one of the most\r\naccomplished ladies, and a painter? Do you know Mr. Sargent? Do you\r\ncorrespond with your old companion in arms, Col. John Trumbull? Do\r\nyou think Fisher will be an historical painter?\r\n\r\nWhenever you shall find a painter, male or female, I pray you to\r\nsuggest a scene and subject.\r\n\r\nThe scene is the council chamber of the old town house in Boston. The\r\ndate is the month of February, 1761, nine years before you came to me\r\nin Cole lane. As this is five years before you entered college, you\r\nmust have been in the second form of master Lovell's school.\r\n\r\nThat council chamber was as respectable an apartment, and more so\r\ntoo, in proportion, than the house of lords or house of commons in\r\nGreat Britain, or that in Philadelphia in which the declaration of\r\nindependence was signed in 1776.\r\n\r\nIn this chamber, near the fire, were seated five judges, with\r\nlieutenant governor Hutchinson at their head, as chief justice; all\r\nin their new fresh robes of scarlet English cloth, in their broad\r\nbands, and immense judicial wigs. In this chamber was seated at a\r\nlong table all the barristers of Boston, and its neighbouring county\r\nof Middlesex, in their gowns, bands and tye-wigs. They were not\r\nseated on ivory chairs; but their dress was more solemn and more\r\npompous than that of the Roman Senate, when the Gauls broke in upon\r\nthem. In a corner of the room must be placed wit, sense, imagination,\r\ngenius, pathos, reason, prudence, eloquence, learning, science, and\r\nimmense reading, hung by the shoulders on two crutches, covered\r\nwith a cloth great coat, in the person of Mr. Pratt, who had been\r\nsolicited on both sides but would engage on neither, being about to\r\nleave Boston forever, as chief justice of New York.\r\n\r\nTwo portraits, at more than full length, of king Charles the second,\r\nand king James the second, in splendid golden frames, were hung\r\nup in the most conspicuous side of the apartment. If my young eyes\r\nor old memory have not deceived me, these were the finest pictures\r\nI have seen. The colours of their long flowing robes and their\r\nroyal ermines were the most glowing, the figures the most noble and\r\ngraceful, the features the most distinct and characteristic: far\r\nsuperior to those of the king and queen of France in the senate\r\nchamber of congress. I believe they were Vandyke's. Sure I am there\r\nwas no painter in England capable of them at that time. They had been\r\nsent over without frames, in governor Pownal's time. But as he was no\r\nadmirer of Charleses or Jameses, they were stowed away in a garret\r\namong rubbish, till governor Bernard came, had them cleaned, superbly\r\nframed, and placed in council for the admiration and imitation of all\r\nmen, no doubt with the concurrence of Hutchinson and all the junto;\r\nfor there has always been a junto. One circumstance more. Samuel\r\nQuincy and John Adams had been admitted barristers at that term. John\r\nwas the youngest. He should be painted, looking like a short thick\r\nfat archbishop of Canterbury, seated at the table, with a pen in his\r\nhand, lost in admiration, now and then minuting those despicable\r\nnotes which you know that ******** ******** stole from my desk,\r\nand printed in the Massachusetts Spy, with two or three bombastic\r\nexpressions interpolated by himself; and which your pupil, judge\r\nMinot, has printed in his history.\r\n\r\nYou have now the stage and the scenery. Next follows a narration of\r\nthe subject. I rather think that we lawyers ought to call it a brief\r\nof the cause.\r\n\r\nWhen the British ministry received from general Amherst his\r\ndespatches, announcing his conquest of Montreal, and the consequent\r\nannihilation of the French government and power in America, in 1759,\r\nthey immediately conceived the design and took the resolution of\r\nconquering the English colonies, and subjecting them to the unlimited\r\nauthority of parliament. With this view and intention, they sent\r\norders and instructions to the collector of the customs in Boston,\r\nMr. Charles Paxton, to apply to the civil authority for writs of\r\nassistance, to enable the custom house officers, tide waiters, land\r\nwaiters, and all, to command all sheriffs and constables to attend\r\nand aid them in breaking open houses, stores, shops, cellars, ships,\r\nbales, trunks, chests, casks, packages of all sorts, to search for\r\ngoods, wares and merchandizes, which had been imported against the\r\nprohibitions, or without paying the taxes imposed by certain acts of\r\nparliament, called \"THE ACTS OF TRADE,\" _i. e._ by certain\r\nparliamentary statutes, which had been procured to be passed from\r\ntime to time, for a century before, by a combination of selfish\r\nintrigues between West India planters and North American royal\r\ngovernors. These acts never had been executed, and there never had\r\nbeen a time when they would have been, or could have been, obeyed.\r\n\r\nMr. Paxton, no doubt consulting with governor Bernard, lieutenant\r\ngovernor Hutchinson, and all the principal crown officers, and\r\nall the rest of the Junto, thought it not prudent to commence his\r\noperations in Boston. For obvious reasons, he instructed his deputy\r\ncollector in Salem, Mr. Cockle, to apply by petition to the superior\r\ncourt, in November, 1760, then sitting in that town, for writs of\r\nassistance. Stephen Sewall was then chief justice of that court, an\r\nable man, an uncorrupted American, and a sound whig, a sincere friend\r\nof liberty, civil and religious. He expressed great doubts of the\r\nlegality of such a writ, and of the authority of the court to grant\r\nit. Not one of his brother judges uttered a word in favor of it; but\r\nas it was an application on the part of the crown, it must be heard\r\nand determined. After consultation, the court ordered the question to\r\nbe argued at the next February term, in Boston, _i. e._ in 1761.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time chief justice Sewall died, and lieutenant governor\r\nHutchinson was appointed chief justice of that court in his stead.\r\nEvery observing and thinking man knew that this appointment was made\r\nfor the direct purpose of deciding this question, in favour of the\r\ncrown, and all others in which it should be interested.\r\n\r\nAn alarm was spread far and wide. Merchants of Salem and Boston\r\napplied to Mr. Pratt, who refused, and to Mr. Otis and Mr. Thatcher,\r\nwho accepted, to defend them against this terrible menacing monster,\r\nthe writ of assistance. Great fees were offered, but Otis, and I\r\nbelieve Thatcher, would accept of none. \"In such a cause,\" said Otis,\r\n\"I despise all fees.\"\r\n\r\nI have given you a sketch of the stage and the scenery, and a brief\r\nof the cause; or, if you like the phrase better, of the tragedy,\r\ncomedy or farce.\r\n\r\nNow for the actors and performers. Mr. Gridley argued with his\r\ncharacteristic learning, ingenuity and dignity, and said every thing\r\nthat could be said in favour of Cockle's petition, all depending,\r\nhowever, on the \"If the parliament of Great Britain is the sovereign\r\nlegislator of all the British empire.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Thatcher followed him on the other side, and argued with the\r\nsoftness of manners, the ingenuity, the cool reasoning which were\r\npeculiar to his amiable character.\r\n\r\nBut Otis was a flame of Fire! With a promptitude of classical\r\nallusions, a depth of research, a rapid summary of historical events\r\nand dates, a profusion of legal authorities, a prophetic glare of\r\nhis eyes into futurity, and a rapid torrent of impetuous eloquence\r\nhe hurried away all before him. American independence was then and\r\nthere born. The seeds of patriots and heroes to defend the _Non Sine\r\nDiis Animosus Infans_; to defend the vigorous youth were then and\r\nthere sown. Every man of an immense crowded audience appeared to me\r\nto go away as I did, ready to take arms against writs of assistance.\r\nThen and there was the first scene of the first act of opposition\r\nto the arbitrary claims of Great Britain. Then and there the child\r\nIndependence was born. In fifteen years, i. e. in 1776, he grew up to\r\nmanhood and declared himself free.\r\n\r\nThe court adjourned for consideration, and after some days at the\r\nclose of the term, Hutchinson chief justice arose and said, \"The\r\ncourt has considered the subject of writs of assistance, and can see\r\nno foundation for such a writ; but as the practise in England is not\r\nknown, it has been thought best, to continue the question to next\r\nterm, that in the mean time opportunity may be given to write to\r\nEngland for information concerning the subject.\" In six months the\r\nnext term arrived; but no judgment was pronounced; nothing was said\r\nabout writs of assistance; no letters from England, and nothing more\r\nwas said in court concerning them.--But it was generally reported and\r\nunderstood that the court clandestinely granted them; and the custom\r\nhouse officers had them in their pockets, though I never knew that\r\nthey dared to produce and execute them in any one instance.\r\n\r\nMr. Otis's popularity was without bounds. In May, 1761, he was\r\nelected into the house of representatives, by an almost unanimous\r\nvote. On that week I happened to be at Worcester attending a court\r\nof common pleas of which, brigadier Ruggles was chief justice.\r\nWhen the news arrived from Boston, you can have no idea of the\r\nconsternation among the government people. Chief justice Ruggles at\r\ndinner at colonel Chandler's on that day, said, \"Out of this election\r\nwill arise a damn'd faction, which will shake this province to its\r\nfoundation.\"\r\n\r\nFor ten years afterwards Mr. Otis, at the head of his country's\r\ncause, conducted the town of Boston and the people of the province\r\nwith a prudence and fortitude, at every sacrifice of personal\r\ninterest and amidst unceasing persecution, which would have done\r\nhonour to the most virtuous patriot or martyr of antiquity.\r\n\r\nI fear I shall make you repent of bringing out the old gentleman.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE HON. WM. TUDOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Quincy_, _April_ 5, 1818.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nIn Mr. Wirt's elegant and eloquent panegyrick on Mr. Henry I beg your\r\nattention from page 56 to page 67, the end of the second section,\r\nwhere you will read a curious specimen of the agonies of patriotism\r\nin the early stages of the revolution. \"When Mr. Henry could carry\r\nhis resolutions but by one vote, and that against the influence of\r\nRandolph, Bland, Pendleton, Wythe and all the old members whose\r\ninfluence in the house had till then been unbroken; and when Peyton\r\nRandolph afterwards president of congress swore a round oath, he\r\nwould have given 500 guineas for a single vote; for one vote would\r\nhave divided the house, and Robinson was in the chair, who he knew\r\nwould have negatived the resolution.\"\r\n\r\nAnd you will also see the confused manner in which they were first\r\nrecorded, and how they have since been garbled in history. My remarks\r\nat present will be confined to the anecdote in page 65.\r\n\r\nCæsar had his Brutus, Charles the first, his Cromwell, and George the\r\nthird. Treason cried the speaker--treason, treason, echoed from every\r\npart of the house. Henry finished his sentence by the words, \"may\r\nprofit by their example.\" If this be treason make the most of it.\r\n\r\nIn judge Minot's history of Massachusetts Bay, volume second, in page\r\n102 and 103, you will find another agony of patriotism in 1762, three\r\nyears before Mr. Henry's. Mr. Otis suffered one of equal severity in\r\nthe house of representatives of Massachusetts. Judge Minot's account\r\nof it is this.\r\n\r\nThe remonstrance offered to the governor was attended with\r\naggravating circumstances. It was passed, after a very warm speech,\r\nby a member in the house, and at first contained the following\r\noffensive observation.\r\n\r\n\"For it will be of little consequence to the people whether they\r\nwere subject to George or Louis; the king of Great Britain, or the\r\nFrench king; if both were arbitrary, as both would be, if both could\r\nlevy taxes without parliament.\" Though judge Minot does not say it,\r\nthe warm speech was from the tongue, and the offensive observation,\r\nfrom the pen of James Otis; when these words of the remonstrance were\r\nfirst read in the house, Timothy Pain, Esq. a member from Worcester,\r\nin his zeal for royalty, though a very worthy and very amiable man,\r\ncried out, treason! treason! the house however were not intimidated,\r\nbut voted the remonstrance with all the treason contained in it, by a\r\nlarge majority; and it was presented to the governor by a committee\r\nof which Mr. Otis was a member.\r\n\r\nJudge Minot proceeds--\"The governor was so displeased with the\r\npassage, that he sent a letter to the speaker, returning the message\r\nto the house; in which he said, that the king's name, dignity and\r\ncause, were so improperly treated that he was obliged to desire the\r\nspeaker to recommend earnestly to the house, that it might not be\r\nentered upon the minutes in the terms in which it then stood. For if\r\nit should, he was then satisfied they would again and again, wish\r\nthat some part of it were expunged, especially if it should appear,\r\nas he doubted not it would when he entered upon his vindication, that\r\nthere was not the least ground for the insinuation, under colour\r\nof which, that sacred and well beloved name was so disrespectfully\r\nbrought into question.\"\r\n\r\nUpon the reading of this letter, the exceptionable clause was struck\r\nout of the message.\r\n\r\nI have now before me a pamphlet printed in 1763, by Edes & Gill, in\r\nQueen-street, Boston, entitled a vindication of the conduct of the\r\nhouse of representatives of the province of the Massachusetts Bay,\r\nmore particularly in the last session of the general assembly, by\r\nJames Otis, Esq. a member of said house, with this motto--\r\n\r\n     Let such, such only, tread this sacred floor,\r\n     Who dare to love their Country and be poor;\r\n     Or good, tho' rich, humane and wise, tho' great,\r\n     Jove give but these, we've nought to fear from fate.\r\n\r\nI wish I could transcribe the whole of this pamphlet, because it is a\r\ndocument of importance in the early history of the revolution, which\r\nought never to be forgotten. It shows in a strong light the heaves\r\nand throes of the burning mountain, three years at least, before the\r\nexplosion of the volcano in Massachusetts or Virginia.\r\n\r\nHad judge Minot ever seen this pamphlet, could he have given so\r\nsuperficial an account of this year, 1762? There was more than one\r\n\"_warm speech_\" made in that session of the legislature; Mr. Otis\r\nhimself, made many. A dark cloud hung over the whole continent; but\r\nit was peculiarly black and threatening over Massachusetts and the\r\ntown of Boston, against which devoted city the first thunderbolts of\r\nparliamentary omnipotence were intended and expected to be darted.\r\nMr. Otis, from his first appearance in the house in 1761, had shewn\r\nsuch a vast superiority of talents, information and energy to every\r\nother member of the house, that in 1763 he took the lead as it were\r\nof course. He opened the session with a speech, a sketch of which he\r\nhas given us himself. It depends upon no man's memory. It is warm; it\r\nis true. But it is warm only with loyalty to his king, love to his\r\ncountry, and exultations in her exertions in the national cause.\r\n\r\nThis pamphlet ought to be reprinted and deposited in the cabinet\r\nof the curious. The preface, is a frank, candid and manly page,\r\nexplaining the motive of the publication, viz: the clamours against\r\nthe house for their proceedings, in which he truly says.--\"The world\r\never has been, and ever will be pretty equally divided, between those\r\ntwo great parties, vulgarly called the winners and the losers; or\r\nto speak more precisely, between those who are discontented that\r\nthey have no power, and those who think they never can have enough.\"\r\nNow it is absolutely impossible to please both sides either by\r\ntemporizing, trimming or retreating; the two former justly incur the\r\ncensure of a wicked heart; the latter that of cowardice, and fairly\r\nand manfully fighting the battle, and it is in the opinion of many\r\nworse than either. On the 8th of September, A. D. 1762, the war still\r\ncontinuing in North America and the West Indies, governor Bernard\r\nmade his speech to both houses, and presented a _requisition_ of sir\r\nJeffery Amherst, that the Massachusetts troops should be continued in\r\npay during the winter.\r\n\r\nMr. Otis made a speech, the outlines of which he has recorded in the\r\npamphlet, urging a compliance with the governor's recommendation and\r\ngeneral Amherst's requisition; and concluding with a motion for a\r\ncommittee to consider of both.\r\n\r\nA committee was appointed, of whom Mr. Otis was one, and reported not\r\nonly a continuance of the troops already in service, but an addition\r\nof nine hundred men, with an augmented bounty to encourage their\r\nenlistment.\r\n\r\nIf the orators on the 4th of July, really wish to investigate the\r\nprinciples and feelings which produced the revolution, they ought to\r\nstudy this pamphlet and Dr. Mayhew's sermon on passive obedience and\r\nnon-resistance, and all the documents of those days. The celebrations\r\nof independence have departed from the object of their institution,\r\nas much as the society for the propagation of the gospel in foreign\r\nparts have from their charter. The institution had better be wholly\r\nabolished, than continued an engine of the politics and feelings of\r\nthe day, instead of a memorial of the principles and feelings of the\r\nrevolution half a century ago, I might have said for two centuries\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nThis pamphlet of Mr. Otis exhibits the interesting spectacle of\r\na great man glowing with loyalty to his sovereign, proud of his\r\nconnection with the British empire, rejoicing in its prosperity, its\r\ntriumphs and its glory, exulting in the unexampled efforts of his own\r\nnative province to promote them all: but at the same time grieving\r\nand complaining at the ungenerous treatment that province had\r\nreceived from its beginning from the mother country, and shuddering\r\nunder the prospect of still greater ingratitude and cruelty from the\r\nsame source. Hear a few of his words, and read all the rest.\r\n\r\n\"_Mr. Speaker_--This province has upon all occasions been\r\ndistinguished by its loyalty and readiness to contribute its most\r\nstrenuous efforts for his majesty's service. I hope this spirit will\r\never remain as an indelible characteristic of this people,\" &c. &c.\r\n\"Our own immediate interest therefore, as well as the general cause\r\nof our king and country requires, that we should contribute the last\r\npenny and the last drop of blood, rather than by any backwardness\r\nof ours, his majesty's measures should be embarrassed: and thereby\r\nany of the enterprises that may be planned for the regular troops,\r\nmiscarry. Some of these considerations I presume, induced the\r\nassembly upon his majesty's requisition, signified last spring by\r\nlord Egremont, so cheerfully and unanimously to raise thirty three\r\nhundred men for the present campaign; and upon another requisition\r\nsignified by sir Jeffery Amherst to give a handsome bounty for\r\nenlisting about nine hundred more into the regular service. The\r\ncolonies, we know, have often been blamed without cause; and we\r\nhave had some share of it. Witness the miscarriage of the pretended\r\nexpedition against Canada, in queen Ann's time, just before the\r\ninfamous treaty of Utrecht. It is well known by some now living\r\nin this metropolis, that the officers both of the army and navy,\r\nexpressed their utmost surprise at it upon their arrival. To some of\r\nthem no doubt, it was a disappointment; for in order to shift the\r\nblame of this shameful affair from themselves, they endeavoured to\r\nlay it upon the New England colonies.\r\n\r\n\"I am therefore clearly for raising the men,\" &c. &c. \"This province\r\nhas, since the year 1754, levied for his majesty's service as\r\nsoldiers and seamen, near thirty thousand men, besides what have been\r\notherwise employed. One year in particular it was said that every\r\nfifth man was engaged in one shape or another.--We have raised sums\r\nfor the support of this war, that the last generation could hardly\r\nhave formed any idea of. We are now deeply in debt,\" &c. &c.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th of September, the house received a message from the\r\ngovernor, containing a somewhat awkward confession of certain\r\nexpenditures of public money with advice of council, which had not\r\nbeen appropriated by the house. He had fitted out the Massachusetts\r\nsloop of war, increased her establishment of men, &c. Five years\r\nbefore, perhaps this irregularity might have been connived at or\r\npardoned; but, since the debate concerning writs of assistance, and\r\nsince it was known that the acts of trade were to be enforced, and a\r\nrevenue collected by authority of parliament, Mr. Otis's maxim, that\r\n\"taxation without representation was tyranny,\" and \"that expenditures\r\nof public money, without appropriations by the representatives of the\r\npeople, were unconstitutional, arbitrary and therefore tyrannical,\"\r\nhad become popular proverbs. They were common place observations in\r\nthe streets. It was impossible that Otis should not take fire upon\r\nthis message of the governor. He accordingly did take fire, and made\r\nthat flaming speech which judge Minot calls \"_a warm speech_\" without\r\ninforming us who made it or what it contained. I wish Mr. Otis had\r\ngiven us this warm speech as he has the comparatively cool one, at\r\nthe opening of the session. But this is lost forever. It concluded\r\nhowever, with a motion for a committee to consider the governor's\r\nmessage and report. The committee was appointed, and Otis was the\r\nfirst after the speaker.\r\n\r\nThe committee reported the following answer and remonstrance, every\r\nsyllable of which is Otis:\r\n\r\n\"_May it please your Excellency_:\r\n\r\n\"The house have duly attended to your excellency's message of the\r\neleventh inst. relating to the Massachusetts sloop, and are humbly\r\nof opinion that there is not the least necessity for keeping up her\r\npresent complement of men, and therefore desire that your excellency\r\nwould be pleased to reduce them to six, the old establishment made\r\nfor said sloop by the general court. Justice to ourselves, and to our\r\nconstituents obliges us to remonstrate against the method of making\r\nor increasing establishments by the governor and council.\r\n\r\n\"It is in effect, taking from the house their most darling privilege,\r\nthe right of originating all taxes.\r\n\r\n\"It is, in short, annihilating one branch of legislation. And when\r\nonce the representatives of the people give up this privilege, the\r\ngovernment will very soon become arbitrary.\r\n\r\n\"No necessity therefore, can be sufficient to justify a house of\r\nrepresentatives in giving up such a privilege; for it would be of\r\nlittle consequence to the people, whether they were subject to\r\nGeorge or Louis, the king of Great Britain or the French king; if\r\nboth were arbitrary, as both would be, if both could levy taxes\r\nwithout parliament.\r\n\r\n\"Had this been the first instance of the kind, we might not have\r\ntroubled your excellency about it; but lest the matter should go into\r\nprecedent, we earnestly beseech your excellency, as you regard the\r\npeace and welfare of the province, that no measures of this nature be\r\ntaken for the future, let the advice of council be what it may.\"\r\n\r\nThis remonstrance being read, was accepted by a large majority, and\r\nsent up and presented to his excellency by a committee of whom Mr.\r\nOtis was one.\r\n\r\nBut here, Mr. Tudor, allow me, a digression, an episode. Lord\r\nEllenborough in the late trial of Hone, says \"the Athanasian Creed is\r\nthe most beautiful composition that ever flowed from the pen of man.\"\r\n\r\nI agree with his lordship, that it is the most consummate mass\r\nof absurdity, inconsistency and contradiction that ever was put\r\ntogether. But I appeal to your taste and your conscience, whether the\r\nforegoing remonstrance of James Otis is not as terse a morsel of good\r\nsense, as Athanasius's Creed is of nonsense and blasphemy?\r\n\r\nThe same day the above remonstrance was delivered, the town was\r\nalarmed with a report, that the house had sent a message to his\r\nexcellency, reflecting on his majesty's person and government, and\r\nhighly derogatory to his crown and dignity, and therein desired, that\r\nhis excellency would in no case take the advice of his majesty's\r\ncouncil.\r\n\r\nThe governor's letter to the speaker, is as judge Minot represents\r\nit. Upon reading it, the same person who had before cried out,\r\ntreason! treason! when he first heard the offensive words, now cried\r\nout, \"rase them! rase them!\" They were accordingly expunged.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the debate, a new and surprising doctrine was\r\nadvanced. We have seen the times, when the majority of a council by\r\ntheir words and actions have seemed to think themselves obliged to\r\ncomply with every thing proposed by the chair, and to have no rule\r\nof conduct but a governor's will and pleasure. But now for the first\r\ntime it was asserted, that the governor in all cases was obliged to\r\nact according to the advice of council, and consequently would be\r\ndeemed to have no judgment of his own.\r\n\r\nIn page 17, Mr. Otis enters on his apology, excuse or justification\r\nof the offensive words: which, as it is as facetious as it is\r\nedifying, I will transcribe at length in his own words, viz:\r\n\r\n\"In order to excuse, if not altogether justify the offensive passage,\r\nand clear it from ambiguity, I beg leave to premise two or three\r\ndata. 1. GOD made all men naturally equal. 2. The ideas of\r\nearthly superiority, pre-eminence and grandeur, are educational, at\r\nleast acquired, not innate. 3. Kings were, and plantation governors\r\nshould be made for the good of the people, and not the people for\r\nthem. 4. No government has a right to make hobby-horses, asses and\r\nslaves of the subjects; nature having made sufficient of the former,\r\nfor all the lawful purposes of man, from the harmless peasant in the\r\nfield, to the most refined politician in the cabinet; but none of\r\nthe last, which infallibly proves they are unnecessary. 5. Though\r\nmost governments are _de facto_ arbitrary, and consequently the curse\r\nand scandal of human nature, yet none are _de jure_ arbitrary. 6.\r\nThe British constitution of government, as now established in his\r\nmajesty's person and family, is the wisest and best in the world.\r\n7. The king of Great Britain is the best, as well as the most\r\nglorious monarch upon the globe, and his subjects the happiest in the\r\nuniverse. 8. It is most humbly presumed, the king would have all his\r\nplantation governors follow his royal example, in a wise and strict\r\nadherence to the principles of the British constitution, by which in\r\nconjunction with his other royal virtues, he is enabled to reign in\r\nthe hearts of a brave and generous, a free and loyal people. 9. This\r\nis the summit, the _ne plus ultra_ of human glory and felicity. 10.\r\nThe French king is a despotic arbitrary prince, and consequently his\r\nsubjects are very miserable.\r\n\r\n\"Let us now take a more careful review of this passage, which by\r\nsome out of doors has been represented as seditious, rebellious, and\r\ntraitorous. I hope none, however, will be so wanting to the interest\r\nof their country, as to represent the matter in this light on the\r\neast side of the Atlantic, though recent instances of such a conduct\r\nmight be quoted, wherein the province has, after its most strenuous\r\nefforts, during this and other wars been painted in all the odious\r\ncolours, that avarice, malice, and the worst passions could suggest.\r\n\r\n\"The house assert, that it would be of little consequence to the\r\npeople, whether they were subject to George or Louis; the king of\r\nGreat Britain or the French king, if both were arbitrary as both\r\nwould be, if both could levy taxes without parliament. Or in the same\r\nwords transposed without the least alteration of the sense. It would\r\nbe of little consequence to the people, whether they were subject to\r\nGeorge the king of Great Britain, or Louis the French king, if both\r\nwere arbitrary, as both would be, if both could levy taxes without\r\nparliament.\r\n\r\n\"The first question that would occur to a philosopher, if any\r\nquestion could be made about it, would be, whether it were true? But\r\ntruth being of little importance, with most modern politicians, we\r\nshall touch lightly on that topic, and proceed to inquiries of a more\r\ninteresting nature.\r\n\r\n\"That arbitrary government implies the worst of temporary evils, or\r\nat least the continual danger of them, is certain. That a man would\r\nbe pretty equally subject to these evils, under every arbitrary\r\ngovernment, is clear. That I should die very soon after my head\r\nshould be cut off, whether by a sabre or a broad sword, whether\r\nchopped off to gratify a tyrant, by the Christian name of Tom,\r\nDick, or Harry, is evident. That the name of the tyrant would be of\r\nno more avail to save my life, than the name of the executioner,\r\nneeds no proof. It is therefore manifestly of no importance what\r\na prince's christian name is, if he be arbitrary, any more indeed\r\nif he were not arbitrary. So the whole amount of this dangerous\r\nproposition, may at least, in one view be reduced to this, viz:\r\n_It is of little importance what a king's christian name is._ It\r\nis, indeed, of importance, that a king, a governor, and all other\r\ngood christians, should have a christian name, but whether Edward,\r\nFrancis, or William, is of none, that I can discern. It being a rule,\r\nto put the most mild and favourable construction upon words, that\r\nthey can possibly bear, it will follow, that this proposition is a\r\nvery harmless one, that cannot by any means tend to prejudice his\r\nmajesty's person, crown, dignity, or cause, all which I deem equally\r\nsacred with his excellency.\r\n\r\n\"If this proposition will bear an hundred different constructions,\r\nthey must all be admitted before any that imports any bad meaning,\r\nmuch more a treasonable one.\r\n\r\n\"It is conceived the house intended nothing disrespectful to his\r\nmajesty, his government, or governor, in those words. It would be\r\nvery injurious to insinuate this of a house, that upon all occasions\r\nhas distinguished itself by a truly loyal spirit, and which spirit\r\npossesses at least nine hundred and ninety nine in a thousand,\r\nof their constituents throughout the province. One good natured\r\nconstruction at least seems to be implied in the assertion, and that\r\npretty strongly, viz: that in the present situation of Great Britain\r\nand France, it is of vast importance to be a Britain rather than a\r\nFrenchman, as the French king is an arbitrary, despotic prince, but\r\nthe king of Great Britain is not so _de jure_, _de facto_, nor by\r\ninclination; a greater difference on this side the grave cannot be\r\nfound, than that which subsists between British subjects and the\r\nslaves of tyranny.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps it may be objected, that there is some difference even\r\nbetween arbitrary princes; in this respect at least, that some\r\nare more vigorous than others. It is granted; but, then, let it\r\nbe remembered, that the life of man is a vapour, that shall soon\r\nvanish away, and we know not who may come after him, a wise man or\r\na fool; though the chances before and since Solomon have ever been\r\nin favour of the latter. Therefore it is said of little consequence.\r\nHad it been _no_ instead of _little_, the clause upon the most rigid\r\nstricture might have been found barely exceptionable.\r\n\r\n\"Some fine gentlemen have charged the expression as indelicate. This\r\nis a capital impeachment in politics, and therefore demands our\r\nmost serious attention. The idea of delicacy, in the creed of some\r\npoliticians, implies, that an inferior should, at the peril of all\r\nthat is near and dear to him, i. e. his interest, avoid, every the\r\nleast trifle that can offend his superior. Does my superior want\r\nmy estate? I must give it him, and that with a good grace; which is\r\nappearing, and, if possible, being really obliged to him, that he\r\nwill condescend to take it. The reason is evident; it might give\r\nhim some little pain or uneasiness to see me whimpering, much more\r\nopenly complaining, at the loss of a little glittering dirt. I must\r\naccording to this system, not only endeavour to acquire myself,\r\nbut impress upon all around me, a reverence and passive obedience,\r\nto the sentiments of my superior, little short of adoration. Is\r\nthe superior in contemplation a king, I must consider him as God's\r\nVicegerent, cloathed with unlimited power, his will the supreme law,\r\nand not accountable for his actions, let them be what they may, to\r\nany tribunal upon earth. Is the superior a plantation governor? He\r\nmust be viewed, not only as the most excellent representation of\r\nmajesty, but as a viceroy in his department, and _quoad_ provincial\r\nadministration, to all intents and purposes, vested with all the\r\nprerogatives that were ever exercised by the most absolute prince in\r\nGreat Britain.\r\n\r\n\"The votaries of this sect, are all monopolizers of offices,\r\npeculators, informers, and generally the seekers of all kinds. It is\r\nbetter, say they, to \"give up any thing, and every thing quietly,\r\nthan contend with a superior, who, by his prerogative, can do, and as\r\nthe vulgar express it, right or wrong, will have whatever he pleases.\r\nFor you must know, that according to some of the most refined and\r\nfashionable systems of modern politics, the ideas of right and wrong,\r\nand all the moral virtues, are to be considered only as the vagaries\r\nof a weak and distempered imagination in the possessor, and of no use\r\nin the world, but for the skilful politician to convert to his own\r\npurposes of power and profit. With these\r\n\r\n     \"The love of country is an empty name;\r\n     For gold they hunger, but ne'er thirst for fame.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is well known, that the least \"patriotic spark\" unawares\r\n\"catched\" and discovered, disqualifies a candidate from all further\r\npreferment in this famous and flourishing order of knights errant.\r\nIt must, however, be confessed, that they are so catholic as to\r\nadmit all sorts, from the knights of the post, to a garter and\r\nstar, provided they are thoroughly divested of the fear of God, and\r\nthe love of mankind; and have concentrated all their views in dear\r\nself, with them the only \"sacred and well beloved name\" or thing in\r\nthe universe. See Cardinal Richlieu's Political Testament, and the\r\ngreater Bible of the Sect, Mandeville's Fable of the Bees. Richlieu\r\nexpressly, in solemn earnest, without any sarcasm or irony, advises\r\nthe discarding all honest men from the presence of a prince, and from\r\neven the purlieus of a court. According to Mandeville, \"the moral\r\nvirtues are the political offspring which flattery begot upon pride.\"\r\nThe most darling principle of the great apostle of the order, who\r\nhas done more than any mortal towards diffusing corruption, not only\r\nthrough the three kingdoms, but through the remotest dominions, is,\r\nthat every man has his price, and that if you bid high enough you are\r\nsure of him.\r\n\r\n\"To those who have been taught to bow at the name of a king, with\r\nas much ardor and devotion as a papist at the sight of a crucifix,\r\nthe assertion under examination may appear harsh; but _there is an\r\nimmense difference between the sentiments of a British house of\r\ncommons remonstrating, and those of a courtier cringing for a favour.\r\nA house of representatives here, at least, bears an equal proportion\r\nto a governor, with that of a house of commons, to the king_. There\r\nis indeed one difference in favour of a house of representatives;\r\nwhen a house of commons address the king, they speak to their\r\nsovereign, who is truly the most august personage upon earth. When\r\na house of representatives remonstrate to a governor, they speak to\r\na fellow subject, though a superior who is undoubtedly entitled to\r\ndecency and respect; but I hardly think to quite so much reverence as\r\nhis master.\r\n\r\n\"It may not be amiss to observe, that a form of speech may be in no\r\nsort improper, when used _arguendo_, or for illustration, speaking of\r\nthe king; which same form may be very harsh, indecent and ridiculous,\r\nif spoken to the king.\r\n\r\n\"The expression under censure has had the approbation of divers\r\ngentlemen of sense, who are quite unprejudiced to any party. They\r\nhave taken it to imply a compliment, rather than any indecent\r\nreflection upon his majesty's wise and gracious administration.\r\nIt seems strange, therefore, that the house should be so suddenly\r\ncharged by his excellency, with \"impropriety, groundless\r\ninsinuations,\" &c.\r\n\r\n\"What cause of so bitter repentance, 'again and again,' could\r\npossibly have taken place, if this clause had been printed in the\r\njournal, I cannot imagine. If the case be fairly represented, I guess\r\nthe province can be in no danger from a house of representatives\r\ndaring to speak plain English when they are complaining of a\r\ngrievance. I sincerely believe that the house had no disposition\r\nto enter into any contest with the governor or council. Sure I\r\nam, that the promoters of this address had no such view. On the\r\ncontrary, there is the highest reason to presume, that the house\r\nof representatives will at all times rejoice in the prosperity of\r\nthe governor and council, and contribute their utmost assistance\r\nin supporting those two branches of the legislature in all their\r\njust rights and pre-eminence. But the house is, and ought to be,\r\njealous and tenacious of its own privileges; _these are a sacred\r\ndeposit, entrusted by the people, and the jealousy of them is a godly\r\njealousy_.\"\r\n\r\nAllow me now, Mr. Tudor, a few remarks: 1. Why has the sublime\r\ncompliment of \"treason! treason!\" made to Mr. Henry, in 1765, been\r\nso celebrated, when that to Mr. Otis, in 1762, three years before,\r\nhas been totally forgotten? Because the Virginia Patriot has had many\r\ntrumpeters, and very loud ones; but the Massachusetts Patriot none,\r\nthough false accusers and vile calumniators in abundance.\r\n\r\n2. I know not whether judge Minot was born in 1762. He certainly\r\nnever saw, heard, felt, or understood any thing of the principles\r\nor feelings of that year. If he had, he could not have given so\r\nfrosty an account of it. The \"warm speech\" he mentions, was an\r\nabridgment or second edition of Otis's argument in 1761, against the\r\nexecution of the acts of trade. It was a flaming declaration against\r\ntaxation without representation. It was a warning voice against the\r\ncalamities that were coming upon his country. It was an ardent effort\r\nto alarm and arouse his countrymen against the menacing system of\r\nparliamentary taxation.\r\n\r\n3. Bernard was no great thing, but he was not a fool. It is\r\nimpossible to believe, that he thought the offensive passage treason\r\nor sedition, of such danger and importance as he represented it. But\r\nhis design was to destroy Otis. \"There is your enemy,\" said Bernard,\r\n(after a Scottish general) \"if ye do not kill him, he will kill you.\"\r\n\r\n4. How many volumes are concentrated in this little fugitive\r\npamphlet, the production of a few hurried hours, amidst the continual\r\nsolicitations of a crowd of clients; for his business at the bar at\r\nthat time was very extensive and of the first importance; and amidst\r\nthe host of politicians, suggesting their plans and schemes, claiming\r\nhis advice and directions!\r\n\r\n5. Look over the declarations of rights and wrongs issued by congress\r\nin 1774. Look into the declaration of independence, in 1776. Look\r\ninto the writings of Dr. Price and Dr. Priestly. Look into all the\r\nFrench constitutions of government; and to cap the climax, look into\r\nMr. Thomas Paine's common sense, crisis, and rights of man; what\r\ncan you find that is not to be found in solid substance in this\r\n\"vindication of the house of representatives?\"\r\n\r\n6. Is it not an affront to common sense, an insult to truth, virtue,\r\nand patriotism, to represent Patrick Henry, though he was my friend\r\nas much as Otis, as the father of the American revolution, and the\r\nfounder of American independence? The gentleman who has done this,\r\nsincerely believed what he wrote I doubt not; but he ought to be made\r\nsensible, that he is of yesterday, and knows nothing of the real\r\norigin of the American revolution.\r\n\r\n7. If there is any bitterness of spirit discernible in Mr. Otis's\r\nvindication, this was not natural to him. He was generous, candid,\r\nmanly, social, friendly, agreeable, amiable, witty, and gay, by\r\nnature, and by habit honest, almost to a proverb, though quick and\r\npassionate against meanness and deceit. But at this time he was\r\nagitated by anxiety for his country, and irritated by a torrent\r\nof slander and scurrillity, constantly pouring upon him from all\r\nquarters.\r\n\r\nMr. Otis has fortified his vindication, in a long and learned note,\r\nwhich, in mercy to my eyes and fingers, I must borrow another hand to\r\ntranscribe, in another sheet.\r\n\r\n[Here follow quotations from Locke on government, Part II. Ch. IV.\r\nId. Ch. XI. Id. Ch. XIV. B. I. Ch. II. and B. II. Ch. II.]\r\n\r\n\"This other original Mr. Locke has demonstrated to be the consent\r\nof a free people. It is possible there are a few; and I desire to\r\nthank God there is no reason to think there are many among us, that\r\ncannot bear the names of liberty and property, much less, that the\r\nthings signified by those terms, should be enjoyed by the vulgar.\r\nThese may be inclined to brand some of the principles advanced in\r\nthe vindication of the house, with the odious epithets seditious\r\nand levelling. Had any thing to justify them been quoted from\r\ncolonel Algernon Sydney, or other British martyrs to the liberty of\r\ntheir country, an outcry of rebellion would not be surprising. The\r\nauthority of Mr. Locke has therefore been preferred to all others,\r\nfor these further reasons. 1st. He was not only one of the most wise\r\nas well as most honest, but the most impartial man that ever lived.\r\n2d. He professedly wrote his discourses on government, as he himself\r\nexpresses it, \"to establish the throne of the great restorer king\r\nWilliam; to make good his title in the consent of the people, which\r\nbeing the only one of all lawful governments, he had more fully and\r\nclearly than any prince in Christendom, and to justify to the world\r\nthe people of England, whose love of liberty, their just and natural\r\nrights, with their resolution to preserve them, saved the nation\r\nwhen it was on the brink of slavery and ruin.\" By this title, our\r\nillustrious sovereign, George 3d, (whom God long preserve) now holds.\r\n3. Mr. Locke was as great an ornament, under a crowned head, as the\r\nchurch of England ever had to boast of. Had all her sons been of his\r\nwise, moderate, tolerant principles, we should probably never have\r\nheard of those civil dissentions, that have so often brought the\r\nnation to the borders of perdition. Upon the score of his being a\r\nchurchman, however, his sentiments are less liable to those invidious\r\nreflections and insinuations, that high flyers, jacobites, and\r\nother stupid bigots, are apt too liberally to bestow, not only upon\r\ndissenters of all denominations, but upon the moderate; and therefore\r\ninfinitely the most valuable part of the church of England itself.\"\r\n\r\nPardon the trouble of reading the letter, from your habitual\r\npartiality for your friend.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE HON. WM. TUDOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Quincy_, _April_ 15, 1818.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nI have received your obliging favour of the 8th, but cannot consent\r\nto your resolution to ask no more questions. Your questions revive\r\nmy sluggish memory. Since our national legislature have established\r\na national painter--a wise measure, for which I thank them, my\r\nimagination runs upon the art, and has already painted, I know not\r\nhow many, historical pictures. I have sent you one, give me leave\r\nto send another. The bloody rencontre between the citizens and\r\nthe soldiers, on the 5th of March, 1770, produced a tremendous\r\nsensation throughout the town and country. The people assembled\r\nfirst at Faneuil Hall, and adjourned to the old South Church, to the\r\nnumber, as was conjectured, of ten or twelve thousand men, among\r\nwhom were the most virtuous, substantial, independent, disinterested\r\nand intelligent citizens.--They formed themselves into a regular\r\ndeliberative body, chose their moderator and secretary, entered\r\ninto discussions, deliberations and debates, adopted resolutions,\r\nappointed committees. What has become of these records, Mr. Tudor?\r\nWhere are they? Their resolutions in public were conformable to those\r\nof every man in private, who dared to express his thoughts or his\r\nfeelings, \"that the regular soldiers should be banished from the\r\ntown, at all hazards.\" Jonathan Williams, a very pious, inoffensive\r\nand conscientious gentleman, was their moderator. A remonstrance to\r\nthe governor, or the governor and council, was ordained, and a demand\r\nthat the regular troops should be removed from the town. A committee\r\nwas appointed to present this remonstrance, of which _Samuel Adams_\r\nwas the chairman.\r\n\r\nNow for the picture. The theatre and the scenery are the same with\r\nthose at the discussion of writs of assistance. The same glorious\r\nportraits of king Charles II. and king James II. to which might\r\nbe added, and should be added, little miserable likenesses of\r\nGov. Winthrop, Gov. Bradstreet, Gov. Endicott and Gov. Belcher,\r\nhung up in obscure corners of the room. Lieut. Gov. Hutchinson,\r\ncommander in chief in the absence of the governor, must be placed\r\nat the head of the council table. Lieut. Col. Dalrymple, commander\r\nin chief of his majesty's military forces, taking rank of all his\r\nmajesty's counsellors, must be seated by the side of the lieutenant\r\ngovernor and commander in chief of the province. Eight and twenty\r\ncounsellors must be painted, all seated at the council board. Let me\r\nsee, what costume? What was the fashion of that day, in the month\r\nof March? Large white wigs, English scarlet cloth cloaks, some of\r\nthem with gold laced hats, not on their heads, indeed, in so august\r\na presence, but on a table before them. Before these illustrious\r\npersonages appeared SAMUEL ADAMS, a member of the house of\r\nrepresentatives and their clerk, now at the head of the committee\r\nof the great assembly at the old South church. Thucidydes, Livy or\r\nSallust would make a speech for him, or, perhaps, the Italian Bota,\r\nif he had known any thing of this transaction, one of the most\r\nimportant of the revolution; but I am wholly incapable of it; and, if\r\nI had vanity enough to think myself capable of it, should not dare to\r\nattempt it. He represented the state of the town and the country; the\r\ndangerous, ruinous and fatal effects of standing armies in populous\r\ncities in time of peace, and the determined resolution of the public,\r\nthat the regular troops, at all events, should be removed from the\r\ntown. Lieutenant governor Hutchinson, then commander in chief, at the\r\nhead of a trembling council, said, \"he had no authority over the\r\nking's troops, that they had their separate commander and separate\r\norders and instructions, and that he could not interfere with them.\"\r\nMr. Adams instantly appealed to the charter of the province, by\r\nwhich the governor, and in his absence the lieutenant governor, was\r\nconstituted \"commander in chief of all the military and naval power\r\nwithin its jurisdiction.\" So obviously true and so irrefragable\r\nwas the reply, that it is astonishing that Mr. Hutchinson should\r\nhave so grossly betrayed the constitution, and so atrociously have\r\nviolated the duties of his office by asserting the contrary. But\r\neither the fears or the ambition of this gentleman, upon this and\r\nmany other occasions, especially in his controversy with the two\r\nhouses, three years afterwards, on the supremacy of parliament,\r\nappear to have totally disarranged his understanding. He certainly\r\nasserted in public, in the most solemn manner, a multitude of the\r\nroundest falshoods, which he must have known to be such, and which he\r\nmust have known could be easily and would certainly be detected, if\r\nhe had not wholly lost his memory, even of his own public writing.\r\nYou, Mr. Tudor, knew Mr. Adams from your childhood to his death. In\r\nhis common appearance, he was a plain, simple, decent citizen, of\r\nmiddling stature, dress and manners. He had an exquisite ear for\r\nmusic, and a charming voice, when he pleased to exert it.--Yet his\r\nordinary speeches in town meetings, in the house of representatives\r\nand in congress, exhibited nothing extraordinary; but upon great\r\noccasions, when his deeper feelings were excited, he erected himself,\r\nor rather nature seemed to erect him, without the smallest symptom of\r\naffectation, into an upright dignity of figure and gesture, and gave\r\na harmony to his voice, which made a strong impression on spectators\r\nand auditors, the more lasting for the purity, correctness and\r\nnervous elegance of his style.\r\n\r\nThis was a delicate and a dangerous crisis. The question in the last\r\nresort was, whether the town of Boston should become a scene of\r\ncarnage and desolation or not? Humanity to the soldiers conspired\r\nwith a regard for the safety of the town, in suggesting the wise\r\nmeasure of calling the town together to deliberate. For nothing short\r\nof the most solemn promises to the people, that the soldiers should,\r\nat all hazards, be driven from the town, had preserved its peace.\r\nNot only the immense assemblies of the people, from day to day, but\r\nmilitary arrangements from night to night, were necessary to keep\r\nthe people and the soldiers from getting together by the ears. The\r\nlife of a red coat would not have been safe in any street or corner\r\nof the town. Nor would the lives of the inhabitants have been much\r\nmore secure. The whole militia of the city was in requisition, and\r\nmilitary watches and guards were every where placed. We were all upon\r\na level; no man was exempted; our military officers were our only\r\nsuperiors. I had the honor to be summoned in my turn, and attended\r\nat the state house with my musket and bayonet, my broadsword and\r\ncartridge box, under the command of the famous Paddock. I know you\r\nwill laugh at my military figure; but I believe there was not a more\r\nobedient soldier in the regiment, nor one more impartial between the\r\npeople and the regulars. In this character I was upon duty all night\r\nin my turn. No man appeared more anxious or more deeply impressed\r\nwith a sense of danger on all sides, than our commander Paddock.\r\nHe called me, common soldier as I was, frequently to his councils.\r\nI had a great deal of conversation with him, and no man appeared\r\nmore apprehensive of a fatal calamity to the town, or more zealous\r\nby every prudent measure to prevent it. Such was the situation of\r\naffairs, when Samuel Adams was reasoning with lieutenant governor\r\nHutchinson and lieutenant colonel Dalrymple. He had fairly driven\r\nthem from all their outworks, breastworks and entrenchments, to their\r\ncitadel. There they paused and considered and deliberated. The heads\r\nof Hutchinson and Dalrymple were laid together in whispers for a long\r\ntime: when the whispering ceased, a long and solemn pause ensued,\r\nextremely painful to an impatient and expecting audience. Hutchinson,\r\nin time, broke silence; he had consulted with colonel Dalrymple,\r\nand the colonel had authorized him to say that he might order one\r\nregiment down to the castle, if that would satisfy the people. With a\r\nself-recollection, a self-possession, a self-command, a presence of\r\nmind that was admired by every man present, Samuel Adams arose with\r\nan air of dignity and majesty, of which he was sometimes capable,\r\nstretched forth his arm, though even then quivering with palsy, and\r\nwith an harmonious voice and decisive tone, said, \"if the lieutenant\r\ngovernor or colonel Dalrymple, or both together, have authority to\r\nremove one regiment, they have authority to remove two; and nothing\r\nshort of the total evacuation of the town by all the regular troops,\r\nwill satisfy the public mind or preserve the peace of the province.\"\r\n\r\nThese few words thrilled through the veins of every man in the\r\naudience, and produced the great result. After a little awkward\r\nhesitation, it was agreed that the town should be evacuated and both\r\nregiments sent to the castle.\r\n\r\nAfter all this gravity it is merry enough to relate that William\r\nMolineaux, was obliged to march side by side with the commander of\r\nsome of their troops, to protect them from the indignation of the\r\npeople, in their progress to the wharf of embarcation for the castle.\r\nNor is it less amusing that lord North, as I was repeatedly and\r\ncredibly informed in England, with his characteristic mixture of good\r\nhumour and sarcasm, ever after called these troops by the title of\r\n\"Sam Adams's two regiments.\"\r\n\r\nThe painter should seize upon the critical moment when Samuel Adams\r\nstretched out his arm, and made his last speech.\r\n\r\nIt will be as difficult to do justice, as to paint an Apollo; and\r\nthe transaction deserves to be painted as much as the surrender of\r\nBurgoyne. Whether any artist will ever attempt it, I know not.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE HON. WM. TUDOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Quincy_, _April_ 23, 1818.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nYour letter of the 5th has been received. Your judgment of Mr. Wirt's\r\nbiography of my friend, Mr. Henry, is in exact unison with my own.\r\nI have read it with more delight than Scott's romances in verse and\r\nprose, or Miss Porter's Scottish Chiefs, and other novels.\r\n\r\nI am sorry you have introduced me. I could wish my own name\r\nforgotten, if I could develope the true causes of the rise and\r\nprogress of American revolution and independence.\r\n\r\nWhy have Harmodius and Brutus, Coligni and Brederode, Cromwell and\r\nNapoleon failed, and a thousand others? Because human nature cannot\r\nbear prosperity. Success always intoxicates patriots as well as\r\nother men; and because birth and wealth always, in the end, overcome\r\npopular and vulgar envy, more surely than public interest.\r\n\r\nThe causes of our parties during and since the revolution, would lead\r\nme too far.\r\n\r\nYou cannot ask me too many questions. I will answer them all\r\naccording as strength shall be allowed to your aged and infirm friend,\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE HON. WM. TUDOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Quincy_, _May_ 12, 1818.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nIn my letters to you, I regard no order. And I think, I ought to\r\nmake you laugh sometimes: otherwise my letters would be too grave,\r\nif not too melancholy. To this end, I send you Jemmibellero, \"the\r\nsong of the drunkard\" which was published in Fleet's \"Boston Evening\r\nPost,\" on the 13th of May, 1765. It was universally agreed to have\r\nbeen written by Samuel Waterhouse, who had been the most notorious\r\nscribbler, satyrist and libeller, in the service of the conspirators,\r\nagainst the liberties of America, and against the administration of\r\ngovernor Pownal, and against the characters of Mr. Pratt and Mr.\r\nTyng. The rascal had wit. But is ridicule the test of truth? You\r\nsee the bachanalian ha! ha! at Otis's prosodies Greek and Latin;\r\nand you see the encouragement of scholarship in that age. The whole\r\nlegion, the whole phalanx, the whole host of conspirators against the\r\nliberties of America, could not have produced Mr. Otis's Greek and\r\nLatin prosodies. Yet they must be made the scorn of fools. Such was\r\nthe character of the age, or rather of the day. Such have been and\r\nsuch will be the rewards of real patriotism in all ages and all over\r\nthe world.--I am, as ever, your old friend and humble servant,\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE HON. WM. TUDOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Quincy_, _June_ 1, 1818.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nNo man could have written from memory Mr. Otis's argument of four or\r\nfive hours, against the acts of trade, as revenue laws, and against\r\nwrits of assistants, as a tyrannical engine to execute them, the next\r\nday after it was spoken. How awkward, then, would be an attempt to\r\ndo it after a lapse of fifty seven years? Nevertheless, some of the\r\nheads of his discourse are so indelibly imprinted on my mind, that I\r\nwill endeavour to give you some very short hints of them.\r\n\r\n1. He began with an exordium, containing an apology for his\r\nresignation of the office of advocate general in the court of\r\nadmiralty; and for his appearance in that cause in opposition to the\r\ncrown, and in favour of the town of Boston, and the merchants of\r\nBoston and Salem.\r\n\r\n2. A dissertation on the rights of man in a state of nature. He\r\nasserted, that every man, merely natural, was an independent\r\nsovereign, subject to no law, but the law written on his heart, and\r\nrevealed to him by his Maker, in the constitution of his nature,\r\nand the inspiration of his understanding and his conscience. His\r\nright to his life, his liberty, no created being could rightfully\r\ncontest. Nor was his right to his property less incontestible. The\r\nclub that he had snapped from a tree, for a staff or for defence,\r\nwas his own. His bow and arrow were his own; if by a pebble he had\r\nkilled a partridge or a squirrel, it was his own. No creature, man\r\nor beast, had a right to take it from him. If he had taken an eel,\r\nor a smelt, or a sculpion, it was his property. In short, he sported\r\nupon this topic with so much wit and humour, and at the same time so\r\nmuch indisputable truth and reason, that he was not less entertaining\r\nthan instructive. He asserted, that these rights were inherent and\r\ninalienable. That they never could be surrendered or alienated but by\r\nideots or madmen, and all the acts of ideots and lunatics were void,\r\nand not obligatory by all the laws of God and man. Nor were the poor\r\nnegroes forgotten. Not a Quaker in Philadelphia, or Mr. Jefferson,\r\nof Virginia, ever asserted the rights of negroes in stronger terms.\r\nYoung as I was, and ignorant as I was, I shuddered at the doctrine he\r\ntaught; and I have all my life time shuddered, and still shudder, at\r\nthe consequences that may be drawn from such premises. Shall we say,\r\nthat the rights of masters and servants clash, and can be decided\r\nonly by force? I adore the idea of gradual abolitions! But who shall\r\ndecide how fast or how slowly these abolitions shall be made?\r\n\r\n3. From individual independence he proceeded to association. If\r\nit was inconsistent with the dignity of human nature to say, that\r\nmen were gregarious animals, like wild horses and wild geese, it\r\nsurely could offend no delicacy to say they were social animals by\r\nnature; that they were mutual sympathies; and, above all, the sweet\r\nattraction of the sexes, which must soon draw them together in little\r\ngroups, and by degrees in larger congregations, for mutual assistance\r\nand defence. And this must have happened before any formal covenant,\r\nby express words or signs, was concluded. When general counsels\r\nand deliberations commenced, the objects could be no other than\r\nthe mutual defence and security of every individual for his life,\r\nhis liberty, and his property. To suppose them to have surrendered\r\nthese in any other way than by equal rules and general consent, was\r\nto suppose them ideots or madmen, whose acts were never binding. To\r\nsuppose them surprised by fraud, or compelled by force, into any\r\nother compact, such fraud and such force could confer no obligation.\r\nEvery man had a right to trample it under foot whenever he pleased.\r\nIn short, he asserted these rights to be derived only from nature,\r\nand the author of nature; that they were inherent, inalienable,\r\nand indefeasible by any laws, pacts, contracts, covenants, or\r\nstipulations, which man could devise.\r\n\r\n4. These principles and these rights were wrought into the English\r\nconstitution as fundamental laws. And under this head he went back to\r\nthe old Saxon laws, and to Magna Charta, and the fifty confirmations\r\nof it in parliament, and the execrations ordained against the\r\nviolators of it, and the national vengeance which had been taken on\r\nthem from time to time, down to the Jameses and Charleses; and to\r\nthe petition of rights and the bill of rights, and the revolution.\r\nHe asserted, that the security of these rights to life, liberty,\r\nand property, had been the object of all those struggles against\r\narbitrary power, temporal and spiritual, civil and political,\r\nmilitary and ecclesiastical, in every age. He asserted, that our\r\nancestors, as British subjects, and we, their descendants, as\r\nBritish subjects, were entitled to all those rights, by the British\r\nconstitution, as well as by the law of nature, and our provincial\r\ncharter, as much as any inhabitant of London or Bristol, or any part\r\nof England; and were not to be cheated out of them by any phantom of\r\n\"virtual representation,\" or any other fiction of law or politics, or\r\nany monkish trick of deceit and hypocrisy.\r\n\r\n5. He then examined the acts of trade, one by one, and demonstrated,\r\nthat if they were considered as revenue laws, they destroyed all our\r\nsecurity of property, liberty, and life, every right of nature, and\r\nthe English constitution, and the charter of the province. Here he\r\nconsidered the distinction between \"external and internal taxes,\" at\r\nthat time a popular and common-place distinction. But he asserted\r\nthere was no such distinction in theory, or upon any principle but\r\n\"necessity.\" The necessity that the commerce of the empire should be\r\nunder one direction, was obvious. The Americans had been so sensible\r\nof this necessity, that they had connived at the distinction between\r\nexternal and internal taxes, and had submitted to the acts of trade\r\nas regulations of commerce, but never as taxations, or revenue laws.\r\nNor had the British government, till now, ever dared to attempt to\r\nenforce them as taxations or revenue laws. They had laid dormant in\r\nthat character for a century almost. The navigation act he allowed\r\nto be binding upon us, because we had consented to it by our own\r\nlegislature. Here he gave a history of the navigation act of the\r\nfirst of Charles 2d. a plagiarism from Oliver Cromwell. This act had\r\nlaid dormant for fifteen years. In 1675, after repeated letters and\r\norders from the king, governor Winthrop very candidly informs his\r\nmajesty, that the law had not been executed, because it was thought\r\nunconstitutional; parliament not having authority over us.\r\n\r\nI shall pursue this subject in a short series of letters. Providence\r\npursues its incomprehensible and inscrutable designs in its own way,\r\nand by its own instruments. And as I sincerely believe Mr. Otis\r\nto have been the earliest and the principal founder of one of the\r\ngreatest political revolutions, that ever occurred among men, it\r\nseems to me of some importance, that his name and character should\r\nnot be forgotten. Young men should be taught to honour merit, but not\r\nto adore it. The greatest men have the greatest faults.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE HON. WM. TUDOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Quincy_, _June_ 9, 1818.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nI have promised you hints of the heads of Mr. Otis's oration,\r\nargument, speech, call it what you will, against the acts of trade,\r\nas revenue laws, and against writs of assistants, as tyrannical\r\ninstruments to carry them into execution.\r\n\r\nBut I enter on the performance of my promise to you, not without fear\r\nand trembling; because I am in the situation of a lady, whom you knew\r\nfirst as my client, the widow of Dr. Ames, of Dedham, and afterwards,\r\nas the mother of your pupil, the late brilliant orator, Fisher Ames,\r\nof Dedham. This lady died last year, at 95 or 96 years of age. In one\r\nof her last years she said, \"She was in an awkward situation; for if\r\nshe related any fact of an old date, any body might contradict her,\r\nfor she could find no witness to keep her in countenance.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Otis, after rapidly running over the history of the continual\r\nterrors, vexations, and irritations, which our ancestors endured from\r\nthe British government, from 1620, under James 1st. and Charles 1st.;\r\nand acknowledging the tranquility under the parliament and Cromwell,\r\nfrom 1648, to the restoration, in 1660, produced the navigation act,\r\nas the first fruit of the blessed restoration of a Stuart's reign.\r\n\r\nThis act is in the 12th year of Charles 2d. chapter 18, \"An act for\r\nthe encouraging and increasing of shipping and navigation.\"\r\n\r\n\"For the increase of shipping, and encouragement of the navigation\r\nof this nation, wherein, under the good providence and protection\r\nof God, the wealth, safety, and strength of this kingdom, is so\r\nmuch concerned, be it enacted, that from and after the first day of\r\nDecember, 1660, and from thence forward, no goods, or commodities,\r\nwhatsoever, shall be imported into, or exported out of, any lands,\r\nislands, plantations, or territories, to his majesty belonging or\r\nin his possession, or which may hereafter belong unto or be in\r\nthe possession of his majesty, his heirs and successors, in Asia,\r\nAfrica, or America, in any other ship or ships, vessel or vessels,\r\nwhatsoever, but in such ships or vessels, as do truly and without\r\nfraud, belong only to the people of England or Ireland, dominion\r\nof Wales, or town of Berwick upon Tweed, or are of the built of,\r\nand belonging to, any of the said lands, islands, plantations or\r\nterritories, as the proprietors and right owners thereof, and whereof\r\nthe master, and three fourths of the mariners, at least, are English;\r\nunder the penalty of the forfeiture, and loss of all the goods and\r\ncommodities which shall be imported into, or exported out of any of\r\nthe aforesaid places, in any other ship or vessel, as also of the\r\nship or vessel, with all its guns, furniture, tackle, ammunition,\r\nand apparel: one third part thereof to his majesty, his heirs and\r\nsuccessors: one third part to the governor of such land, plantation,\r\nisland, or territory, where such default shall be committed, in case\r\nthe said ship or goods be there seized; or otherwise, that third\r\npart also to his majesty, his heirs and successors; and the other\r\nthird part to him or them who shall seize, inform, or sue for the\r\nsame in any court of record, by bill, information, plaint, or other\r\naction, wherein no essoin, protection, or wager of law shall be\r\nallowed: and all admirals and other commanders at sea, of any of the\r\nships of war or other ships, having commission from his majesty, or\r\nfrom his heirs or successors, are hereby authorized, and strictly\r\nrequired to seize and bring in as prize, all such ships or vessels\r\nas shall have offended, contrary hereunto, and deliver them to the\r\ncourt of admiralty, there to be proceeded against; and in case of\r\ncondemnation, one moiety of such forfeitures shall be to the use of\r\nsuch admirals or commanders, and their companies, to be divided and\r\nproportioned among them, according to the rules and orders of the\r\nsea, in case of ships taken prize; and the other moiety to the use of\r\nhis majesty, his heirs and successors.\"\r\n\r\nSection second enacts, all governors shall take a solemn oath to do\r\ntheir utmost, that every clause shall be punctually obeyed. See the\r\nstatute at large.\r\n\r\nSee also section third of this statute, which I wish I could\r\ntranscribe.\r\n\r\nSection fourth enacts, that no goods of foreign growth, production\r\nor manufacture, shall be brought, even in English shipping, from any\r\nother countries, but only from those of the said growth, production\r\nor manufacture, under all the foregoing penalties.\r\n\r\nMr. Otis commented on this statute in all its parts, especially on\r\nthe foregoing section, with great severity. He expatiated on its\r\nnarrow, contracted, selfish, and exclusive spirit. Yet he could not\r\nand would not deny its policy, or controvert the necessity of it,\r\nfor England, in that age, surrounded as she was by France, Spain,\r\nHolland, and other jealous rivals; nor would he dispute the prudence\r\nof governor Leverett, and the Massachusetts legislature, in adopting\r\nit, in 1675, after it had laid dormant for fifteen years; though\r\nthe adoption of it was infinitely prejudicial to the interests, the\r\ngrowth, the increase, the prosperity of the colonies in general, of\r\nNew England in particular; and most of all, to the town of Boston.\r\nIt was an immense sacrifice to what was called the mother country.\r\nMr. Otis thought, that this statute ought to have been sufficient\r\nto satisfy the ambition, the avarice, the cupidity of any nation,\r\nbut especially of one who boasted of being a tender mother of her\r\nchildren colonies; and when those children had always been so fondly\r\ndisposed to acknowledge the condescending tenderness of their dear\r\nindulgent mother.\r\n\r\nThis statute, however, Mr. Otis said, was wholly prohibitory. It\r\nabounded, indeed, with penalties and forfeitures, and with bribes\r\nto governors and informers, and custom house officers, and naval\r\nofficers and commanders; but it imposed no taxes. Taxes were laid\r\nin abundance by subsequent acts of trade; but this act laid none.\r\nNevertheless, this was one of the acts that were to be carried into\r\nstrict execution by these writs of assistance. Houses were to be\r\nbroken open, and if a piece of Dutch linen could be found, from the\r\ncellar to the cock loft, it was to be seized and become the prey of\r\ngovernors, informers, and majesty.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Otis had extended his observations on this act of\r\nnavigation, much farther than I dare to attempt to repeat, he\r\nproceeded to the subsequent acts of trade. These, he contended,\r\nimposed taxes, and enormous taxes, burthensome taxes, oppressive,\r\nruinous, intolerable taxes. And here he gave the reins to his genius,\r\nin declamation, invective, philippic, call it which you will, against\r\n_the tyranny of taxation, without representation_.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Otis's observations on those acts of trade, must be postponed\r\nfor another letter.\r\n\r\nLet me, however, say, in my own name, if any man wishes to\r\ninvestigate thoroughly, the causes, feelings, and principles of the\r\nrevolution, he must study this act of navigation and the acts of\r\ntrade, as a philosopher, a politician, and a philanthropist.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE HON. WM. TUDOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Quincy_, _June_ 17, 1818.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nThe next statute produced and commented by Mr. Otis was the 15th\r\nof Charles the second, _i. e._ 1663, ch. 7. \"An act for the\r\nencouragement of trade.\"\r\n\r\nSec. 5.--\"And in regard his majesty's plantations, beyond the seas\r\nare inhabited and peopled by his subjects of this his kingdom of\r\nEngland, for the maintaining a greater correspondence and kindness\r\nbetween them, and _keeping them in a firmer dependance upon it_,\r\nand rendering them yet more beneficial and advantageous unto it, in\r\nthe further employment and increase of English shipping and seamen,\r\nvent of English woolen and other manufactures and commodities,\r\nrendering the navigation to and from the same, more cheap and safe,\r\nand making _this kingdom a staple_, not only of the commodities of\r\nthose plantations, but also of the commodities of other countries and\r\nplaces, _for the supplying of them_; and it being the usage of other\r\nnations to keep their plantations trades to themselves.\"\r\n\r\nSec. 6.--\"Be it enacted, &c. that no commodity of the growth,\r\nproduction or manufacture of Europe, shall be imported into any\r\nland, island, plantation, colony, territory or place, to his majesty\r\nbelonging, or which shall hereafter belong unto or be in possession\r\nof his majesty, his heirs and successors, in Asia, Africa or America,\r\n(Tangier only excepted) but what shall be _bona fide_, and without\r\nfraud, laden and shipped in England, Wales, or the town of Berwick\r\nupon Tweed, and in English built shipping, or which were _bona fide_\r\nbought before the 1st of October, 1662, and had such certificate\r\nthereof as is directed in one act passed the last session of the\r\npresent parliament, entitled \"_An act for preventing frauds and\r\nregulating abuses in his majesty's customs_;\" and whereof the\r\nmaster, and three fourths of the mariners at least are English,\r\nand which shall be carried directly thence, to the said lands,\r\nislands, plantations, colonies, territories or places, and from no\r\nother place or places whatsoever; any law, statute or usage to the\r\ncontrary notwithstanding; under the penalty of the loss of all such\r\ncommodities of the growth, production or manufacture of Europe, as\r\nshall be imported into any of them, from any other place whatsoever,\r\nby land or water; and if by water, of the ship or vessel also, in\r\nwhich they were imported, with all her guns, tackle, furniture,\r\nammunition and apparel; one third part to his majesty, his heirs and\r\nsuccessors; one third part to the governor of such land, island,\r\nplantation, colony, territory or place, into which such goods were\r\nimported, if the said ship, vessel or goods be there seized or\r\ninformed against and sued for; or otherwise, that third part also to\r\nhis majesty, his heirs and successors; and the other third part to\r\nhim or them who shall seize, inform, or sue for the same in any of\r\nhis majesty's courts in such of the said lands, islands, colonies,\r\nplantations, territories or places where the offence was committed,\r\nor in any court of record in England, by bill, information, plaint,\r\nor other action, wherein no _essoin_ protection or wager of law shall\r\nbe allowed.\"\r\n\r\nSections 7. 8. 9. and 10. of this odious instrument of mischief and\r\nmisery to mankind, all calculated to fortify by oaths and penalties,\r\nthe tyrannical ordinances of the preceding sections.\r\n\r\nMr. Otis's observations on these statutes were numerous, and some of\r\nthem appeared to me at the time, young as I was, bitter. But as I\r\ncannot pretend to recollect those observations with precision, I will\r\nrecommend to you and others to make your own remarks upon them.\r\n\r\nYou must remember, Mr. Tudor, that you and I had much trouble with\r\nthese statutes after you came into my office, in 1770; and I had been\r\ntormented with them for nine years before, _i. e._ from 1761.\r\n\r\nI have no scruple in making a confession with all the simplicity\r\nof Jean Jac Rosseau, that I never turned over the leaves of these\r\nstatutes, or any section of them, without pronouncing a hearty curse\r\nupon them.\r\n\r\nI felt them, as an humiliation, a degradation a disgrace to my\r\nCountry and to myself as a native of it.\r\n\r\nLet me respectfully recommend to the future orators on the fourth of\r\nJuly, to peruse these statutes in pursuit of principles and feelings\r\nthat produced the revolution.\r\n\r\nOh! Mr. Tudor, when will France, Spain, England and Holland renounce\r\ntheir selfish, contracted, exclusive systems of religion, government\r\nand commerce? I fear, never.\r\n\r\nBut they may depend upon it, their present systems of colonization\r\ncannot endure. Colonies universally, ardently breathe for\r\nindependence. No man, who has a soul will ever live in a colony,\r\nunder the present establishments, one moment longer than necessity\r\ncompels him.\r\n\r\nBut I must return to Mr. Otis. The burthen of his song was \"_Writs\r\nof assistance_.\" All these rigorous statutes were now to be carried\r\ninto rigorous execution by the still more vigorous instruments of\r\narbitrary power, \"_Writs of assistance_.\"\r\n\r\nHere arose a number of very important questions. What were writs\r\nof assistance? Where were they to be found? When, where, and by\r\nwhat authority had they been invented, created, and established?\r\nNobody could answer any of these questions.--Neither chief justice\r\nHutchinson, nor any one of his four associate judges, pretended\r\nto have ever read or seen in any book any such writ, or to know\r\nany thing about it. The court had ordered or requested the bar to\r\nsearch for precedents and authorities for it, but none were found.\r\nOtis pronounced boldly, that there were none, and neither judge nor\r\nlawyer, bench or bar, pretended to confute him. He asserted farther,\r\nthat there was no colour of authority for it, but one produced by\r\nMr. Gridley in a statute of the 13th and 14th of Charles the second,\r\nwhich Mr. Otis said was neither authority, precedent or colour of\r\neither, in America. Mr. Thatcher said he had diligently searched\r\nall the books, but could find no such writ. He had indeed found in\r\nRastalls Entries, a thing which in some of its features resembling\r\nthis, but so little like it in the whole, that it was not worth while\r\nto read it.\r\n\r\nMr. Gridley, who, no doubt, was furnished, upon this great and\r\ncritical occasion, with all the information possessed by the\r\ngovernor, lieutenant governor, secretary, custom house officers, and\r\nall other crown officers, produced, the statute of the thirteenth and\r\nfourteenth of Charles the second, chapter eleventh, entitled, \"An Act\r\nto prevent frauds, and regulating abuses in his majesty's customs.\"\r\nSection fifth, which I will quote verbatim. \"And be it further\r\nenacted by the authority aforesaid, that in case, after the clearing\r\nof any ship or vessel, by the person or persons which are or shall\r\nbe appointed by his majesty for managing the customs or any their\r\ndeputies, and discharging the watchmen and tidesmen from attendance\r\nthereupon, there shall be found on board such ship or vessel, any\r\ngoods, wares or merchandizes, which have been concealed from the\r\nknowledge of the said person or persons, which are or shall be so\r\nappointed to manage the customs, and for which the custom, subsidy\r\nand other duties due upon the importation thereof have not been paid;\r\nthen the master, purser, or other person taking charge of said ship\r\nor vessel, shall forfeit the sum of one hundred pounds: and it shall\r\nbe lawful, to or for any person or persons authorized by _writ of\r\nassistance under the seal of his majesty's court of exchequer_, to\r\ntake a constable, headborough, or other public officer, inhabiting\r\nnear unto the place, and in the day time to enter, and go into any\r\nhouse, shop, cellar, warehouse or room, or other place; and in\r\ncase of resistance, to break open doors, chests, trunks, and other\r\npackage, there to seize, and from thence to bring any kind of goods\r\nor merchandize whatsoever prohibited and uncustomed, and to put and\r\nsecure the same, in his majesty's storehouse in the port, next to the\r\nplace where such seizure shall be made.\"\r\n\r\nHere is all the colour for \"Writs of assistance,\" which the officers\r\nof the crown aided by the researches of their learned counsel, Mr.\r\nGridley, could produce.\r\n\r\nWhere, exclaimed Otis, is your seal of his majesty's court of\r\nexchequer? And what has the court of exchequer to do here? But my\r\nsheet is full, and my patience exhausted for the present.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE HON. WM. TUDOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Quincy_, _June_ 24, 1818.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nMr. Otis said such a \"writ of assistance\" might become the reign\r\nof Charles 2d. in England, and he would not dispute the taste of\r\nthe parliament of England, in passing such an act, nor the people\r\nof England in submitting to it; but it was not calculated for the\r\nmeridian of America. The Court of Exchequer had no jurisdiction\r\nhere. Her warrants and her writs were never seen here. Or if they\r\nshould be, they would be waste paper. He insisted however, that\r\nthese warrants and writs were even in England inconsistent with\r\nthe fundamental laws, the natural and constitutional rights of the\r\nsubjects. If, however, it would please the people of England, he\r\nmight admit, that they were legal there, but not here.\r\n\r\nDiligent research had been made by Otis and Thatcher, and by Gridley,\r\naided, as may well be supposed, by the officers of the customs, and\r\nby all the conspirators against American liberty, on both sides the\r\nwater, for precedents and examples of any thing similar to this writ\r\nof assistance, even in England. But nothing could be found, except\r\nthe following: An act of the 12th of Charles 2d. chapter 22. \"An act\r\nfor the regulating the trade of Bay-making, in the Dutch Bay-hall,\r\nin Colchester.\" The fifth section of this statute, \"for the better\r\ndiscovering, finding out and punishing of the frauds and deceits,\r\naforesaid, be it enacted, that it shall and may be lawful for the\r\ngovernors of the Dutch Bay-hall, or their officers or any of them,\r\nfrom time to time, in the day time, to search any cart, waggon or\r\npack, wherein they shall have notice, or suspect any such deceitful\r\nBays to be, and also from time to time, with a constable, who are\r\nhereby required to be aiding and assisting them, to make search in\r\nany house, shop, or warehouse, where they are informed any such\r\ndeceitful Bays to be, and to secure and seize the same, and to carry\r\nthem to the Dutch Bay-hall; and that such Bays so seized and carried\r\nto the said hall, shall be confiscate and forfeit, to be disposed in\r\nsuch manner as the forfeitures herein before mentioned, to be paid by\r\nthe weavers and fullers, are herein before limited and appointed.\"\r\n\r\nThe Dutch Bay-hall made sport for Otis and his audience; but was\r\nacknowledged to have no authority here, unless by certain distant\r\nanalogies and constructions, which Mr. Gridley himself did not\r\npretend to urge. Another ridiculous statute was of the 22d and 23d\r\nof Charles 2d. chapter 8th, \"An act for the regulating the making of\r\nKidderminster Stuffs.\"\r\n\r\nBy the eleventh section of this important law, it is enacted,\r\n\"That the said president, wardens, and assistants of the said\r\nKidderminster weavers, or any two or more of them, shall have, and\r\nhereby have power and authority, to enter into and search the houses\r\nand workhouses of any artificer under the regulation of the said\r\ntrade, at all times of the day, and usual times of opening shops and\r\nworking; and into the shops, houses, and warehouses of any common\r\nbuyer, dealer in, or retailer of any of the said cloths or stuffs,\r\nand into the houses and workhouses of any dyer, sheerman, and all\r\nother workmen's houses and places of sale, or dressing of the said\r\ncloths, or stuffs and yarns; and may there view the said cloths,\r\nstuffs and yarns respectively; and if any cloth, stuff or yarns shall\r\nbe found defective, to seize and carry away the same to be tried by a\r\njury.\"\r\n\r\nThe wit, the humour, the irony, the satire, played off, by Mr.\r\nOtis, in his observations on these acts of navigation, Dutch bays\r\nand Kidderminster stuffs, it would be madness in me to pretend\r\nto remember with any accuracy. But this I do say, that Horace's\r\n\"_Irritat, mulcet, veris terroribus implet_,\" was never exemplified\r\nin my hearing with so great effect. With all his drollery, he\r\nintermixed solid and sober observations upon the acts of navigation,\r\nby Sir Joshua Child, and other English writers upon trade, which I\r\nshall produce together in another letter.\r\n\r\nIt is hard to be called upon, at my age, to such a service as this.\r\nBut it is the duty of\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE HON. WM. TUDOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Quincy_, _July_ 9, 1818.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nIn the search for something, in the history and statutes of England,\r\nin any degree resembling this _monstrum horrendum ingens_, the writ\r\nof assistance, the following examples were found.\r\n\r\nIn the statute of the first year of king James the second, chapter\r\nthird, \"An act for granting to his majesty an imposition upon all\r\nwines and vinegar,\" &c. Section 8, it is enacted, \"That the officers\r\nof his majesty's customs &c. shall have power and authority to enter\r\non board ships and vessels and make searches, and to do all other\r\nmatters and things, which may tend to secure the true payment of\r\nthe duties by this act imposed, and the due and orderly collection\r\nthereof, which any customers, collectors or other officers of any\r\nof his majesty's ports can or may do, touching the securing his\r\nmajesty's customs of tonnage and poundage,\" &c. &c. &c. I must refer\r\nto the statute for the rest.\r\n\r\nIn the statute of king James the second, chapter four, \"An act for\r\ngranting to his majesty an imposition upon all tobacco and sugar\r\nimported,\" &c. Section fifth, in certain cases, \"The commissioners\r\nmay appoint one or more officer or officers to enter into all the\r\ncellars, warehouses, store cellars, or other places whatsoever,\r\nbelonging to such importer, to search, see and try,\" &c. &c. &c. I\r\nmust again refer to the statute for the rest, which is indeed nothing\r\nto the present purpose.\r\n\r\nThough the portraits of Charles the second and James the second\r\nwere blazing before his eyes, their characters and reigns were\r\nsufficiently odious to all but the conspirators against human\r\nliberty, to excite the highest applauses of Otis's philippics against\r\nthem and all the foregoing acts of their reigns, which writs of\r\nassistance were now intended to enforce. Otis asserted and proved,\r\nthat none of these statutes extended to America, or were obligatory\r\nhere by any rule of law, ever acknowledged here, or ever before\r\npretended in England.\r\n\r\nAnother species of statutes were introduced by the counsel for the\r\ncrown, which I shall state as they occur to me without any regard to\r\nthe order of time. 1. of James the second, chapter 17. \"An act for\r\nthe revival and continuance of several acts of parliament therein\r\nmentioned,\" in which the tobacco law among others is revived and\r\ncontinued.\r\n\r\n13th and 14th of Charles 2nd, chapter 13. \"An act for prohibiting\r\nthe importation of foreign bone-lace, cutwork, embroidery, fringe,\r\nband-strings, buttons and needle work.\" Pray sir, do not laugh!\r\nfor something very serious comes in section third. \"Be it further\r\nenacted, that for the preventing of the importing of the said\r\nmanufactures as aforesaid, upon complaint and information given,\r\nto the justices of the peace or any or either of them within their\r\nrespective counties, cities and towns corporate, at times reasonable,\r\nhe or they are hereby authorized and required to issue forth his or\r\ntheir warrants to the constables of their respective counties, cities\r\nand towns, corporate, to enter and search for such manufactures in\r\nthe shops being open, or warehouses and dwelling houses of such\r\nperson or persons, as shall be suspected, to have any such foreign\r\nbone-laces, embroideries, cut-work, fringe, band-strings, buttons\r\nor needle work within their respective counties, cities, and towns\r\ncorporate, and to seize the same, any act, statute or ordinance to\r\nthe contrary thereof in any wise notwithstanding.\"\r\n\r\nAnother curious act was produced, to prove the legality of writs of\r\nassistance, though it was no more to the purpose than all the others.\r\nI mean the statute of the 12th of Charles the second, chapter third,\r\n\"An act for the continuance of process and judicial proceedings\r\ncontinued.\" In which it is enacted, section first, \"That no pleas,\r\nwrits, bills, actions, suits, plaints, process, precepts, or other\r\nthing or things, &c. shall be in any wise continued,\" &c.\r\n\r\nBut I must refer to the act. I cannot transcribe. If any antiquarian\r\nshould hereafter ever wish to review this period, he will see with\r\ncompassion how such a genius as Otis was compelled to delve among the\r\nrubbish of such statutes, to defend the country against the gross\r\nsophistry of the crown and its officers.\r\n\r\nAnother act of 12 C. 2d, ch. 12, \"An act for confirmation of judicial\r\nproceedings,\" in which it is enacted, &c. \"that nor any writs, or\r\nactions on, or returns of any writs, orders or other proceedings in\r\nlaw or equity, had made, given, taken or done, or depending in the\r\ncourts of chancery, king's bench, upper bench, common pleas, and\r\ncourt of exchequer, and court of exchequer chamber, or any of them,\r\n&c. in the kingdom of England, &c. shall be avoided, &c.\" I must\r\nrefer to the statute.\r\n\r\nIn short, wherever the custom house officers could find in any\r\nstatute the word \"writs\", the word \"continued\" and the words \"court\r\nof exchequer,\" they had instructed their counsel to produce it,\r\nthough in express \"words restricted to the realm.\" Mr. Gridley was\r\nincapable of prevaricating or duplicity.\r\n\r\nIt was a moral spectacle, more affecting to me than any I have since\r\nseen upon any stage, to see a pupil treating his master with all the\r\ndeference, respect, esteem and affection of a son to a father, and\r\nthat without the least affectation; while he baffled and confounded\r\nall his authorities, and confuted all his arguments and reduced him\r\nto silence.\r\n\r\nIndeed, upon the principle of construction, inference, analogy, or\r\ncorollary, by which they extended these acts to America, they might\r\nhave extended the jurisdiction of the court of king's bench, and\r\ncourt of common pleas, and all the sanguinary statutes against crimes\r\nand misdemeanors, and all their church establishment of archbishops\r\nand bishops, priests, deacons, deans and chapters; and all their acts\r\nof uniformity, and all their acts against conventicles.\r\n\r\nI have no hesitation or scruple to say that the commencement of the\r\nreign of George the third was the commencement of another Stuart's\r\nreign: and if it had not been checked by James Otis and others\r\nfirst, and by the great Chatham and others afterwards, it would have\r\nbeen as arbitrary as any of the four. I will not say it would have\r\nextinguished civil and religious liberty upon earth; but it would\r\nhave gone great lengths towards it, and would have cost mankind even\r\nmore than the French revolution to preserve it. The most sublime,\r\nprofound and prophetic expression of Chatham's oratory that he ever\r\nuttered was, \"I rejoice that America has resisted; two millions of\r\npeople reduced to servitude, would be fit instruments to make slaves\r\nof the rest.\"\r\n\r\nAnother statute was produced, 12 C. 2. cap. 19, \"An act to prevent\r\nfrauds and concealments of his majesty's customs and subsidies.\"\r\n\"Be it enacted,\" &c. \"that if any person or persons &c. shall cause\r\nany goods, for which custom, subsidy, or other duties are due or\r\npayable, &c. to be landed or conveyed away, without due entry thereof\r\nfirst made and the customer or collector, or his deputy agreed\r\nwith; that then and in such case, _upon oath thereof made_ before\r\nthe lord treasurer, or any of the barons of the exchequer, or chief\r\nmagistrate of the port or place where the offence shall be committed,\r\nor the next adjoining thereto, it shall be lawfull, to and for\r\nthe lord treasurer, or any of the barons of the exchequer, or the\r\nchief magistrate of the port or place, &c. to issue out a warrant\r\nto any person or persons, thereby enabling him or them, with the\r\nassistance of a sheriff, justice of the peace or constable, to enter\r\ninto any house in the day time where such goods are suspected to be\r\nconcealed, and in case of resistance, to break open such houses, and\r\nto seize and secure the same goods so concealed; and all officers and\r\nministers of justice are hereby required to be aiding and assisting\r\nthereunto.\"\r\n\r\nSuch was the sophistry; such the chicanery of the officers of the\r\ncrown, and such their power of face, as to apply these statutes to\r\nAmerica and to the petition for writs of assistance from the superior\r\ncourt.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE HON. WM. TUDOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Quincy_, _July_ 14, 1818.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nMr. Otis, to show the spirit of the acts of trade, those I have\r\nalready quoted, as well as of those I shall hereafter quote, and as\r\nthe best commentaries upon them, produced a number of authors upon\r\ntrade, and read passages from them, which I shall recite, without\r\npretending to remember the order in which he read them.\r\n\r\n1. Sir Josiah Child, \"A new discourse of trade.\" Let me recommend\r\nthis old book to the perusal of my inquisitive fellow citizens. A\r\ndiscerning mind will find useful observations on the interest of\r\nmoney, the price of labour, &c. &c. &c. I would quote them all, if\r\nI had time. But I will select one. In page 15, of his preface, he\r\nsays, \"I understand not the world so little, as not to know, that he\r\nthat will faithfully serve his country, must be _content_ to pass\r\nthrough good report, and evil report.\" I cannot agree to that word,\r\n\"_content_.\" I would substitute instead of it, the words, \"as patient\r\nas he can.\" Sir Josiah adds, \"neither regard I, which I meet with.\"\r\nThis is too cavalierly spoken. It is not sound philosophy. Sir Joshua\r\nproceeds: \"Truth I am sure at last will vindicate itself, and be\r\nfound by my countrymen.\" Amen! So be it! I wish I could believe it.\r\n\r\nBut it is high time for me to return from this ramble to Mr. Otis's\r\nquotations from Sir Joshua Child, whose chapter four, page 105, is\r\n\"concerning the act of navigation.\" Probably this knight was one of\r\nthe most active and able inflamers of the national pride in their\r\nnavy and their commerce, and one of the principal promoters of that\r\nenthusiasm for the act of navigation, which has prevailed to this\r\nday. For this work was written about the year 1677, near the period\r\nwhen the court of Charles 2d. began to urge and insist on the strict\r\nexecution of the act of navigation. Such pride in that statute\r\ndid not become Charles, his court or his nation of royalists and\r\nloyalists, at that time. For shall I blush, or shall I boast, when\r\nI remember, that this act was not the invention of a Briton, but\r\nof an American. George Downing, a native of New England, educated\r\nat Harvard College, whose name, office, and title appear in their\r\ncatalogue, went to England in the time of lord Clarendon's civil\r\nwars, and became such a favourite of Cromwell and the ruling powers,\r\nthat he was sent ambassador to Holland. He was not only not received,\r\nbut ill treated, which he resented on his return to England, by\r\nproposing an act of navigation, which was adopted, and has ruined\r\nHolland, and would have ruined America, if she had not resisted.\r\n\r\nTo borrow the language of the great Dr. Johnson this \"Dog\" Downing\r\nmust have had a head and brains, or in other words genius and\r\naddress: but if we may believe history, he was a scoundrel. To\r\ningratiate himself with Charles 2d. he probably not only pleaded his\r\nmerit in inventing the navigation act, but he betrayed to the block\r\nsome of his old republican and revolutionary friends.\r\n\r\nGeorge Downing! Far from boasting of thee as my countryman, or of thy\r\nstatute as an American invention; if it were lawful to wish for any\r\nthing past, that has not happened, I should wish that thou hadst been\r\nhanged, drawn, and quartered, instead of Hugh Peters, and Sir Henry\r\nVane. But no! This is too cruel for my nature! I rather wish, that\r\nthou hadst been obliged to fly with thy project, and report among the\r\nrocks and caves of the mountains in New England.\r\n\r\nBut where is Downing's statute? British policy has suppressed all the\r\nlaws of England, from 1618 to 1660. The statute book contains not one\r\nline. Such are records, and such is history.\r\n\r\nThe nation, it seems, was not unanimous in its approbation of this\r\nstatute. The great knight himself informs us, page 105, \"that\r\nsome wise and honest gentlemen and merchants doubted whether the\r\ninconveniences it has brought with it be not greater than the\r\nconveniences.\" This chapter was, therefore, written to answer all\r\nobjections; and vindicate and justify Downing's statute.\r\n\r\nMr. Otis cast an eye over this chapter, and adverted to such\r\nobservations in it, as tended to show the spirit of the writer,\r\nand of the statute; which might be summed up in this comprehensive\r\nMachiavelian principle, _that earth, air, and seas, all colonies and\r\nall nations were to be made subservient to the growth, grandeur and\r\npower of the British navy_.\r\n\r\nAnd thus, truly, it happened. The two great knights, Sir George\r\nDowning, and Sir Josiah Child, must be acknowledged to have been\r\ngreat politicians!\r\n\r\nMr. Otis proceeded to chapter 10, of this work, page 166, \"concerning\r\nplantations.\" And he paused at the 6th proposition, in page 167,\r\n\"That all colonies and plantations, do endamage their mother\r\nkingdoms, whereof the trades of such plantations are not confined\r\nby severe laws, and good executions of those laws, to the mother\r\nkingdom.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Otis then proceeded to seize the key to the whole riddle, in page\r\n168, proposition eleventh, \"_that New England is the most prejudicial\r\nplantation to the kingdom of England_.\" Sir George Downing, no doubt,\r\nsaid the same to Charles 2d.\r\n\r\nOtis proceeded to page 170, near the bottom, \"_we must consider\r\nwhat kind of people they were and are that have and do transport\r\nthemselves to our foreign plantations_.\" New England, as every one\r\nknows, was originally inhabited, and hath since been successively\r\nreplenished by a sort of people called Puritans, who could not\r\nconform to the ecclesiastical laws of England; but being wearied with\r\nchurch censures and persecutions, were forced to quit their fathers'\r\nland, to find out new habitations, as many of them did in Germany\r\nand Holland, as well as at New England; and had there not been a\r\nNew England found for some of them, Germany and Holland probably had\r\nreceived the rest: but Old England, to be sure, would have lost them\r\nall.\r\n\r\n\"Virginia and Barbadoes were first peopled by a sort of loose,\r\nvagrant people, vicious, and destitute of the means to live at\r\nhome, (being either unfit for labour, or such as could find none\r\nto employ themselves about, or had so misbehaved themselves by\r\nwhoring, thieving, or other debauchery, that none would set them\r\nat work) which merchants and masters of ships, by their agents,\r\n(or spirits, as they were called) gathered up about the streets of\r\nLondon, and other places, clothed and transported, to be employed\r\nupon plantations; and these I say, were such as, had there been no\r\nEnglish foreign plantation in the world, could probably never have\r\nlived at home, to do service for their country, but must have come to\r\nbe hanged, or starved, or died untimely of some of those miserable\r\ndiseases, that proceed from want and vice; or else have sold\r\nthemselves for soldiers, to be knocked on the head, or starved in the\r\nquarrels of our neighbours, as many thousands of brave Englishmen\r\nwere in the low countries, as also in the wars of Germany, France,\r\nand Sweden, &c. or else, if they could by begging or otherwise,\r\narrive to the stock of 2s. 6d. to waft them over to Holland, become\r\nservants to the Dutch, who refuse none.\r\n\r\n\"But the principal growth and increase of the aforesaid plantations\r\nof Virginia and Barbadoes, happened in, or immediately after, our\r\nlate civil wars, when the worsted party, by the fate of war, being\r\ndeprived of their estates, and having, some of them, never been bred\r\nto labour, and others of them made unfit for it by the lazy habit of\r\na soldier's life, their wanting means to maintain them all abroad,\r\nwith his majesty, many of them betook themselves to the aforesaid\r\nplantations; and great numbers of Scotch soldiers of his majesty's\r\narmy, after Worcester fight, were by the then prevailing powers\r\nvoluntarily sent thither.\r\n\r\n\"Another great swarm or accession of the new inhabitants to the\r\naforesaid plantations, as also to New England, Jamaica, and all\r\nother his majesty's plantations in the West Indies, ensued upon his\r\nmajesty's restoration, when the former prevailing party being by a\r\ndivine hand of providence brought under, the army disbanded, many\r\nofficers displaced, and all the new purchasers of public titles\r\ndispossessed of their pretended lands, estates, &c. many became\r\nimpoverished, and destitute of employment; and therefore such\r\nas could find no way of living at home, and some who feared the\r\nre-establishment of the ecclesiastical laws, under which they could\r\nnot live, were forced to transport themselves, or sell themselves\r\nfor a few years, to be transported by others, to the foreign English\r\nplantations. The constant supply, that the said plantations have\r\nsince had, hath been such vagrant, loose people, as I have before\r\nmentioned, picked up especially about the streets of London and\r\nWestminster, and malefactors condemned for crimes, for which by law\r\nthey deserved to die; and some of those people called quakers,\r\nbanished for meeting on pretence of religious worship.\r\n\r\n\"Now, if from the premises it be duly considered, what kind of\r\npersons those have been, by whom our plantations have at all times\r\nbeen replenished, I suppose it will appear, that such they have been,\r\nand under such circumstances, that if his majesty had had no foreign\r\nplantations to which they might have resorted, England, however, must\r\nhave lost them.\"\r\n\r\nAny man, who will consider with attention these passages from Sir\r\nJosiah Child, may conjecture what Mr. Otis's observations upon\r\nthem were. As I cannot pretend to remember them verbatim, and with\r\nprecision, I can only say, that they struck me very forcibly. They\r\nwere short, rapid; he had not time to be long: but Tacitus himself\r\ncould not express more in fewer words. My only fear is, that I cannot\r\ndo him justice.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, there is a great deal of true history in this\r\npassage, which manifestly proves, that the emigrants to America, in\r\ngeneral, were not only as good as the people in general, whom they\r\nleft in England, but much better, more courageous, more enterprizing,\r\nmore temperate, more discreet, and more industrious, frugal, and\r\nconscientious: I mean the royalists as well as the republicans.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, there is a great deal of uncandid, ungenerous\r\nmisrepresentations, and scurrilous exaggeration, in this passage of\r\nthe great knight, which prove him to have been a fit tool of Charles\r\n2d. and a suitable companion, associate and friend of the great\r\nknight, Sir George Downing, the second scholar in Harvard College\r\ncatalogue.\r\n\r\nBut I will leave you, Mr. Tudor, to make your own observations and\r\nreflections upon these pages of Sir Josiah Child.\r\n\r\nMr. Otis read them with great reluctance; but he felt it his duty to\r\nread them, in order to show the spirit of the author, and the spirit\r\nof Sir George Downing's navigation act.\r\n\r\nBut, my friend, I am weary. I have not done with Mr. Otis or Sir\r\nJosiah Child. I must postpone, to another letter from your friend,\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE HON. WM. TUDOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Quincy_, _July_ 17, 1818.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nMr. Otis proceeded to page 198, of this great work of the great\r\nknight, sir Josiah Child.\r\n\r\nProposition eleventh, \"That New England is the most prejudicial\r\nplantation in this kingdom.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am now to write of a people whose frugality, industry and\r\ntemperance, and the happiness of whose laws and institutions do\r\npromise to themselves long life, with a wonderful increase of\r\npeople, riches and power: and although no men ought to envy that\r\nvirtue and wisdom in others, which themselves either cannot or will\r\nnot practice, but rather to command and admire it; yet I think it\r\nthe duty of every good man primarily to respect the welfare of his\r\nnative country; and therefore, though I may offend some whom I would\r\nnot willingly displease, I cannot omit, in the progress of this\r\ndiscourse, to take notice of some particulars, wherein Old England\r\nsuffers diminution by the growth of those colonies settled in New\r\nEngland, and how that plantation differs from those more southerly,\r\nwith respect to the gain or loss of this kingdom, viz.\r\n\r\n\"All our American plantations, except that of New England, produce\r\ncommodities of different natures from those of this kingdom, as\r\nsugar, tobacco, cocoa, wool, ginger, sundry sorts of dying woods,\r\n&c. Whereas, New England produces generally the same we have here,\r\nviz: corn and cattle: some quantity of fish they do likewise kill,\r\nbut that is taken and saved altogether by their inhabitants, which\r\nprejudiceth our Newfoundland trade; whereas, as hath been said,\r\nvery few are or ought, according to prudence, be employed in those\r\nfisheries but the inhabitants of Old England. The other commodities\r\nwe have from them are some few great masts, furs, and train oil,\r\nwhereof the yearly value amounts to very little, the much greater\r\nvalue of returns from thence being made in sugar, cotton, wool,\r\ntobacco, and such like commodities, which they first receive from\r\nsome other of his majesty's plantations in barter for dry cod fish,\r\nsalt mackerel, beef, pork, bread, beer, flour, peas, &c. which they\r\nsupply Barbadoes, Jamaica, &c. with, to the diminution of the vent of\r\nthose commodities from this kingdom; the greatest expense whereof in\r\nour West India plantations would soon be found in the advance of the\r\nvalue of our lands in England, were it not for the vast and almost\r\nincredible supplies those colonies have from New England.\r\n\r\n\"2. The people of New England, by virtue of their primitive charters,\r\nbeing not so strictly tied to the observation of the laws of this\r\nkingdom, do sometimes assume a liberty of trading, contrary to\r\nthe act of navigation, by reason whereof many of our American\r\ncommodities, especially tobacco and sugar, are transported in New\r\nEngland shipping directly into Spain and other foreign countries,\r\nwithout being landed in England, or paying any duty to his majesty,\r\nwhich is not only loss to the king, and a prejudice to the navigation\r\nof Old England, but also a total exclusion of the old English\r\nmerchants from the vent of those commodities in those ports where\r\nthe new English vessels trade; because there being no custom paid\r\non those commodities in New England, and a great custom paid upon\r\nthem in Old England, it must necessarily follow that the New English\r\nmerchant will be able to afford his commodities much cheaper at\r\nthe market, than the Old English merchant: and those that can sell\r\ncheapest, will infallibly engross the whole trade, sooner or later.\r\n\r\n\"3. Of all the American plantations, his majesty hath none, so apt\r\nfor the building of shipping as New England, nor none so comparably\r\nqualified for breeding of seamen, not only by reason of the natural\r\nindustry of that people, but principally by reason of their cod and\r\nmackerel fisheries: and in my poor opinion, there is nothing more\r\nprejudicial, and in prospect more dangerous to any mother kingdom,\r\nthan the increase of shipping in her colonies, plantations and\r\nprovinces.\"\r\n\r\n\"4. The people that evacuate from us to Barbadoes, and the other West\r\nIndia plantations, as was hinted, do commonly work one Englishman to\r\nten blacks; and if we kept the trade of our said plantation entirely\r\nto England, England would have no less inhabitants, but rather an\r\nincrease of people by such evacuation; because that one Englishman,\r\nwith the ten blacks that work with him, accounting what they eat,\r\nuse, and wear, would make employment for four men in England, as was\r\nsaid before; whereas, peradventure, of ten men that issue from us to\r\nNew England.\r\n\r\n\"To conclude this chapter, and to do right to that most industrious\r\nEnglish colony; I must confess, that though we lose by their\r\nunlimited trade with our foreign plantations, yet we are very great\r\ngainers by their direct trade to and from Old England: our yearly\r\nexportations of English manufactures, malt, and other goods, from\r\nhence thither, amounting in my opinion to ten times the value of\r\nwhat is imported from thence; which calculation I do not make at\r\nrandom, but upon mature consideration, and peradventure upon as much\r\nexperience in this very trade as any other person will pretend to:\r\nand therefore, whenever a reformation of our correspondency in trade\r\nwith that people shall be thought on, it will in my poor judgment\r\nrequire great tenderness and very serious circumspection.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Otis's humour and satire were not idle upon this occasion, but\r\nhis wit served only to increase the effect of a subsequent, very\r\ngrave and serious remonstrance and invective against the detestable\r\nprinciples of the foregoing passages, which he read with regret,\r\nbut which it was his duty to read, in order to shew the temper, the\r\nviews and the objects of the knight, which were the same with those\r\nof all the acts of trade anterior and posterior, to the writing of\r\nthis book: and those views, designs and objects were, to annul all\r\nthe New England charters, and they were but three, Massachusetts,\r\nRhode Island and Connecticut; to reduce all the colonies to royal\r\ngovernments, to subject them all to the supreme domination of\r\nparliament, who were to tax us, without limitation, who would tax us\r\nwhenever the crown would recommend it, which crown would recommend\r\nit, whenever the ministry for the time being should please, and\r\nwhich ministry would please as often as the West India planters and\r\nNorth American governors, crown officers and naval commanders should\r\nsolicit more fees, salaries, penalties and forfeitures.\r\n\r\nMr. Otis had no thanks for the knight for his pharisaical compliment\r\nto New England, at the expense of Virginia and other colonies who\r\nfor any thing he knew were equally meritorious. It was certain the\r\nfirst settlers of New England were not all godly. But he reprobated\r\nin the strongest terms that language can command, the machiavilian,\r\nthe jesuitical, the diabolical and infernal principle that men,\r\ncolonies and nations were to be sacrificed, because they were\r\nindustrious and frugal, wise and virtuous, while others were to be\r\nencouraged, fostered and cherished, because they were pretended to be\r\nprofligate, vicious and lazy.\r\n\r\nBut, my friend, I must quit Josiah Child, and look for others of Mr.\r\nOtis's authorities.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE HON. WM. TUDOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Quincy_, _July_ 27, 1818.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nAnother author produced by Mr. Otis was, \"The trade and navigation\r\nof Great Britain considered,\" by Joshua Gee. \"A new edition, with\r\nmany interesting notes and additions by a merchant,\" printed in 1767.\r\nThis new edition, which was printed no doubt to justify the ministry\r\nin the system they were then pursuing, could not be the edition that\r\nMr. Otis produced in 1761. The advertisement of the editor informs\r\nus that \"This valuable treatise has for many years been very scarce,\r\nthough strongly recommended by the best judges and writers on trade,\r\nand universally allowed to be one of the most interesting books on\r\nthat subject.\" \"The principles upon which it was written continue,\r\nwith little variation.\" But I am fatigued with quotations, and must\r\nrefer you to the advertisement in the book, which will shew, past\r\na doubt, that this was a ministerial republication. The \"feelings,\r\nthe manners and principles,\" which produced the revolution, will\r\nbe excited and renovated by the perusal of this book, as much as\r\nby that of sir Josiah Child. I wish I could fill sheets of paper\r\nwith quotations from it; but this is impossible. If I recommend it\r\nto the research, and perusal, and patient thinking of the present\r\ngeneration, it is in despair of being regarded. For who will engage\r\nin this dry, dull study? Yet Mr. Otis laboured in it. He asserted\r\nand proved, that it was only a reinforcement of the system of sir\r\nJosiah Child, which Gee approved in all things, and even quoted with\r\napprobation the most offensive passage in his book, the scurrilous\r\nreflections on Virginia and Barbadoes.\r\n\r\nAnother writer produced by Mr. Otis was \"Memoirs and considerations,\r\nconcerning the trade and revenues of the British colonies in America;\r\nwith proposals for rendering those colonies more beneficial to Great\r\nBritain. By John Ashley, Esq.\"\r\n\r\nThis book is in the same spirit and system of Josiah Child and Joshua\r\nGee.\r\n\r\nMr. Otis also quoted Postlethwait. But I can quote no more.\r\n\r\nIf any man of the present age can read these authors and not feel his\r\n\"feelings, manners and principles,\" shocked and insulted, I know not\r\nof what stuff he is made. All I can say is, that I read them all in\r\nmy youth, and that I never read them without being set on fire.\r\n\r\nI will, however, transcribe one passage from Ashley, painful as it\r\nis. In page 41, he says, \"The laws now in being, for the regulation\r\nof the plantation trade, viz. the 14 of Charles the second, ch. II.\r\nsec. 2, 3, 9, 10; 7 and 8 William III. ch. 22. sec. 5, 6; 6 George\r\nII. ch. 13, are very well calculated, and were they put in execution\r\nas they ought to be, would in a great measure put an end to the\r\nmischiefs here complained of. If the several officers of the customs\r\nwould see that all entries of sugar, rum and molasses, were made\r\nconformable to the directions of those laws; and let every entry of\r\nsuch goods distinguish expressly, what are of British growth and\r\nproduce, and what are of foreign growth and produce; and let the\r\nwhole cargo of sugar, penneles, rum, spirits, molasses and syrup,\r\nbe inserted at large in the manifest and clearance of every ship\r\nor vessel, under office seal, or be liable to the same duties and\r\npenalties as such goods of foreign growth are liable to.\r\n\r\n\"This would very much baulk the progress of those who carry on this\r\nillicit trade, and be agreeable and advantageous to all fair traders.\r\n\r\n\"And all masters and skippers of boats in all the plantations, should\r\ngive some reasonable security, not to take in any such goods of\r\nforeign growth, from any vessel not duly entered at the custom-house,\r\nin order to land the same, or put the same on board any other ship or\r\nvessel, without a warrant or sufferance from a proper officer.\"\r\n\r\nBut you will be fatigued with quotations, and so is your friend,\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE HON. WM. TUDOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Quincy_, _July_ 30, 1818.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nAnother passage which Mr. Otis read from Ashley gave occasion, as\r\nI suppose, to another memorable and very curious event, which your\r\nesteemed pupil and my beloved friend judge Minot has recorded.\r\n\r\nThe passage is in the 42d page. \"In fine, I would humbly propose that\r\nthe duties on foreign sugar and rum imposed by the before mentioned\r\nact of the 6th of king George the second, remain as they are, and\r\nalso the duty on molasses, so far as concerns the importations into\r\nthe sugar colonies; but that there be an abatement of the duty on\r\nmolasses imported into the northern colonies, so far as to give the\r\nBritish planters a reasonable advantage over foreigners, and what\r\nmay bear some proportion to the charge, risque and inconvenience\r\nof running it, in the manner they now do, or after the proposed\r\nregulation shall be put in execution: whether this duty shall be one,\r\ntwo or three pence, sterling money of Great Britain per gallon, may\r\nbe matter of consideration.\" Gracious and merciful indeed! The tax\r\nmight be reduced and made supportable, but not abolished. Oh! No! by\r\nno means.\r\n\r\nMr. Hutchinson, however, seized this idea of Ashley, of reducing the\r\ntax on molasses, from six pence to three pence or two pence or a\r\npenny, and the use he made of it you shall learn from your own pupil\r\nand my amiable friend judge Minot.\r\n\r\nVolume 2d. page 142. \"About this time there was a pause in the\r\nopposition to the measures of the crown and parliament, which might\r\nhave given some appearance of the conciliation of parties, but which\r\nwas more probably owing to the uncertainty of the eventual plan\r\nof the ministry, and the proper ground for counteracting it. The\r\nsuppressing of the proposed instructions to the agent by a committee\r\nof the house of representatives, indicated that this balance of power\r\nthere was unsettled. Several circumstances shewed a less inflexible\r\nspirit, than had existed among the leaders.\"\r\n\r\n\"The governor appointed the elder Mr. Otis a justice of the court of\r\ncommon pleas, and judge of probate for the county of Barnstable. The\r\nyounger wrote a pamphlet on the rights of the British colonies, in\r\nwhich he acknowledged the sovereignty of the British parliament, as\r\nwell as the obligations of the colonies to submit to such burdens as\r\nit might lay upon them, until it should be pleased to relieve them;\r\nand put the question of taxing America upon the footing of the common\r\ngood.\"\r\n\r\nI beg your attention to Mr. Minot's history, vol. 2, from page 140\r\nto the end of the chapter in page 152. Mr. Minot has endeavoured to\r\npreserve the dignity, the impartiality and the delicacy of history.\r\nBut it was a period of mingled glory and disgrace. But as it is a\r\ndigression from the subject of Mr. Otis's speech against writs of\r\nassistance, I can pursue it no further at present. Mr. Hutchinson\r\nseized the idea of reducing the duties. Mr. Otis and his associates\r\nseemed to despair of any thing more. Hutchinson was chosen agent,\r\nto the utter astonishment of every American out of doors. This was\r\ncommitting the lamb to the kind guardianship of the wolf. The public\r\nopinion of all the friends of their country was decided. The public\r\nvoice was pronounced in accents so terrible that Mr. Otis fell into\r\na disgrace from which nothing but _Jemmibullero_[4] saved him. Mr.\r\nHutchinson was politely excused from his embassy, and the storm\r\nblew over. Otis, upon whose zeal, energy, and exertions the whole\r\ngreat cause seemed to depend, returned to his duty, and gave entire\r\nsatisfaction to the end of his political career.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: _Jemmibullero_--This was a silly and abusive song,\r\nwritten by a Mr. S. Waterhouse, a stanch tory; but with so little\r\nwit, that it only exposed the writer to contempt.]\r\n\r\nThus ended the piddling project of reducing the duty on molasses from\r\nsix pence a gallon, to five pence, four pence, three pence, two pence\r\nor a penny. And one half penny a gallon, would have abandoned the\r\ngreat principle, as much as one pound.\r\n\r\nThis is another digression from the account of Mr. Otis's argument\r\nagainst writs of assistance and the acts of trade. I have heretofore\r\nwritten you on this subject. The truth, the whole truth, must and\r\nwill and ought to come out; and nothing but the truth shall appear,\r\nwith the consent of your humble servant,\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE HON. WM. TUDOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Quincy_, _August_ 6, 1818.\r\n\r\n     \"_Mid the low murmurs of submission, fear and mingled rage,\r\n     my Hampden raised his voice, and to the laws appealed._\"\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nMr. Otis had reasoned like a philosopher upon the navigation acts,\r\nand all the tyrannical acts of Charles 2d.; but when he came to\r\nthe revenue laws, the orator blazed out. Poor king William! If thy\r\nspirit, whether in heaven or elsewhere, heard James Otis, it must\r\nhave blushed. A stadtholder of Holland, by accident, or by miracle,\r\nvested with a little brief authority, in England, cordially adopting\r\nthe system of George Downing, Josiah Child, and Charles 2d. for the\r\ntotal destruction of that country to which he owed his existence, and\r\nall his power and importance in the world. And, what was still worse,\r\njoining in the conspiracy, with such worthy characters to enslave all\r\nthe colonies in Europe, Asia, and America; and indeed all nations, to\r\nthe omnipotence of the British parliament, and its Royal navy.\r\n\r\nThe act of parliament of the seventh and eighth of king William\r\n3d. was produced, chapter 22d. \"An act for preventing frauds, and\r\nregulating abuses in the plantation trade.\" I wish I could transcribe\r\nthis whole statute, and that which precedes it: \"An act for the\r\nencouragement of seamen,\" but who would read them? Yet it behoves\r\nour young and old yeomen, mechanics, and labourers, philosophers,\r\npoliticians, legislators, and merchants to read them. However tedious\r\nand painful it may be for you to read, or me to transcribe, any part\r\nof these dull statutes, we must endure the task, or we shall never\r\nunderstand the American revolution. Recollect and listen to the\r\npreamble of this statute, of the 7th and 8th of William 3d. chapter\r\n22d.\r\n\r\n\"Whereas, notwithstanding diverse acts made for _the encouragement\r\nof the navigation of this kingdom_, and for the better securing\r\nand regulating the plantation trade, more especially one act of\r\nparliament made in the 12th year of the reign of the late king\r\nCharles 2d. intituled, an act for the increasing of shipping and\r\nnavigation. Another act made in the 15th year of the reign of\r\nhis said late majesty, intituled an act for the encouragement of\r\ntrade. Another act made in the 22d and 23d years of his said late\r\nmajesty's reign, intituled, an act to prevent the planting of\r\ntobacco in England, and for regulation of the plantation trade.\r\nAnother act, made in the 25th year of the reign of his said late\r\nmajesty, intituled, an act for the encouragement of the Greenland and\r\nEastland fisheries, and for the better securing the plantation trade,\r\ngreat abuses are daily committed, to the prejudice of the English\r\nnavigation, and the loss of a great part of the plantation trade to\r\nthis kingdom, by the artifice and cunning of ill disposed persons;\r\nfor remedy whereof for the future,\" &c.\r\n\r\nWill you be so good, sir, as to pause a moment on this preamble? To\r\nwhat will you liken it? Does it resemble a great, rich, powerful\r\nWest India planter; Alderman Beckford, for example, preparing and\r\ncalculating and writing instructions for his overseers? \"You are to\r\nhave no regard to the health, strength, comfort, natural affections,\r\nor moral feelings, or intellectual endowments of my negroes. You are\r\nonly to consider what subsistence to allow them, and what labour\r\nto exact of them, will subserve my interest. According to the most\r\naccurate calculation I can make, the proportion of subsistence and\r\nlabour which will work them up, in six years upon an average, is the\r\nmost profitable to the planter.\" And this allowance, surely, is very\r\nhumane; for we estimate here, the lives of our coal-heavers upon an\r\naverage at only two years, and our fifty thousand girls of the town\r\nat three years at most. \"And our soldiers and seamen no matter what.\"\r\n\r\nIs there, Mr. Tudor, in this preamble, or in any statute of Great\r\nBritain, in the whole book, the smallest consideration of the health,\r\nthe comfort, the happiness, the wealth, the growth, the population,\r\nthe agriculture, the manufactures, the commerce, the fisheries of the\r\nAmerican people? All these things are to be sacrificed to British\r\nwealth, British commerce, British domination, and the British navy,\r\nas the great engine and instrument to accomplish all. To be sure,\r\nthey were apt scholars of their master, Tacitus, whose fundamental\r\nand universal principle of philosophy, religion, morality, and\r\npolicy, was, that all nations and all things were to be sacrificed to\r\nthe grandeur of Rome. Oh! my fellow citizens, that I had the voice\r\nof an archangel to warn you against these detestable principles. The\r\nworld was not made for you, you were made for the world. Be content\r\nwith your own rights. Never usurp those of others. What would be the\r\nmerit, and the fortunes of a nation, that should never do or suffer\r\nwrong?\r\n\r\nThe purview of this statute, was in the same spirit with the\r\npreamble; pray read it! Old as you are; you are not so old as I am;\r\nand I assure you I have conquered my natural impatience so far as to\r\nread it again, after almost sixty years acquaintance with it, in all\r\nits horrid deformity.\r\n\r\nEvery artifice is employed to ensure a rigorous, a severe, a cruel\r\nexecution of this system of tyranny. The religion, the morality, of\r\nall plantation governors, of all naval commanders, of all custom\r\nhouse officers, if they had any, and all men have some, were put in\r\nrequisition by the most solemn oaths. Their ambition was inlisted by\r\nthe forfeiture of their officers; their avarice was secured by the\r\nmost tempting penalties and forfeitures, to be divided among them.\r\nFine picking to be sure! Even the lowest, the basest informers were\r\nto be made gentlemen of fortune!\r\n\r\nI must transcribe one section of this detestable statute, and leave\r\nyou to read the rest; I can transcribe no more.\r\n\r\nThe sixth section of this benign law, of our glorious deliverer king\r\nWilliam, is as follows:\r\n\r\nSection 6. \"And for the more effectual preventing of frauds, and\r\nregulating abuses in the plantation trade, in America, be it further\r\nenacted by the authority aforesaid, that all ships coming into, or\r\ngoing out of any of the said plantations, and lading, or unlading any\r\ngoods or commodities, whether the same be his majesty's ships of war,\r\nor merchant ships, and the masters and commanders thereof, and their\r\nladings, shall be subject and liable to the same rules, visitations,\r\nsearches, penalties, and forfeitures, as to the entering, landing,\r\nand discharging their respective ships and ladings, as ships and\r\ntheir ladings, and the commanders and masters of ships, are subject\r\nand liable unto in this kingdom, by virtue of an act of parliament\r\nmade in the fourteenth year of the reign of king Charles 2d.\r\nintituled, an act for preventing frauds, and regulating abuses in\r\nhis majesty's customs. And that the officers for collecting and\r\nmanaging his majesty's revenue, and inspecting the plantation trade,\r\nand in any of the said plantations, shall have the same powers and\r\nauthorities, for visiting and searching of ships, and taking their\r\nentries, and for seizing and securing, or bringing on shore any\r\nof the goods prohibited to be imported or exported into or out of\r\nany the said plantations, or for which any duties are payable, or\r\nought to have been paid, by any of the before mentioned acts, as\r\nare provided for the officers of the customs in England by the said\r\nlast mentioned act, made in the fourteenth year of the reign of king\r\nCharles 2d.; and also to enter houses or warehouses, to search for\r\nand seize any such goods; and that all the wharfingers, and owners of\r\nkeys and wharves, or any lightermen, bargemen, watermen, porters, or\r\nother persons assisting in the conveyance, concealment, or rescue of\r\nany of the said goods, or in the hindering or resistance of any of\r\nthe said officers in the performance of their duty, and the boats,\r\nbarges, lighters, or other vessels employed in the conveyance of\r\nsuch goods, shall be subject to the like pains and penalties as are\r\nprovided by the same act made in the fourteenth year of the reign\r\nof king Charles 2d. in relation to prohibited or unaccustomed goods\r\nin this kingdom; and that \"_the like assistance_\" shall be given to\r\nthe said officers in the execution of their office, as by the said\r\nlast mentioned act is provided for the officers in England; and\r\nalso, that the said officers shall be subject to the same penalties\r\nand forfeitures, for any corruptions, frauds, connivances, or\r\nconcealments, in violation of any the before mentioned laws, as any\r\nofficers of the customs in England are liable to, by virtue of the\r\nlast mentioned act; and also, that in case any officer or officers\r\nin the plantations shall be seized or molested for any thing done\r\nin the execution of their office, the said officer shall and may\r\nplead the general issue, and shall give this or other custom acts in\r\nevidence, and the judge to allow thereof, have and enjoy the like\r\nprivileges and advantages, as are allowed by law to the officers of\r\nhis majesty's customs in England.\"\r\n\r\nCould it be pretended, that the superior court of judicature, court\r\nof assize, and general goal delivery in the province of Massachusetts\r\nbay had all the powers of the court of exchequer in England, and\r\nconsequently could issue warrants like his majesty's court of\r\nexchequer in England? No custom house officer dared to say this,\r\nor to instruct his counsel to say it. It is true, this court was\r\ninvested with all the powers of the courts of king's bench, common\r\npleas and exchequer in England. But this was a law of the province,\r\nmade by the provincial legislature, by virtue of the powers vested in\r\nthem by the charter.\r\n\r\nOtis called and called in vain for their warrant from \"his majesty's\r\ncourt of exchequer.\" They had none, and they could have none from\r\nEngland, and they dared not say, that Hutchinson's court was \"his\r\nmajesty's court of exchequer.\" Hutchinson himself dared not say it.\r\nThe principle would have been fatal to parliamentary pretensions.\r\n\r\nThis is the second and the last time, I believe, that the word\r\n\"_assistance_\" is employed in any of these statutes. But the words\r\n\"writs of assistance\" were no where to be found; in no statute,\r\nno law book, no volume of entries; neither in Rastall, Coke, or\r\nFitzherbert, nor even in Instructor Clericalis, or Burns's Justice.\r\nWhere, then, was it to be found? No where, but in the imagination\r\nor invention of Boston custom house officers, royal governors, West\r\nIndia planters, or naval commanders.\r\n\r\nIt was indeed a farce. The crown, by its agents, accumulated\r\nconstruction upon construction, and inference upon inference, as the\r\ngiants heaped Pelion upon Ossa. I hope it is not impious or profane\r\nto compare Otis to Ovid's jupiter. But \"_misso fulmine perfregit\r\nOlympum, et excussit Subjecto Pelio Ossam_.\" He dashed this whole\r\nbuilding to pieces, and scattered the pulverized atoms to the four\r\nwinds; and no judge, lawyer, or crown officer dared to say, why do\r\nyou so? They were all reduced to total silence.\r\n\r\nIn plain English, by cool, patient comparison of phraseology of these\r\nstatutes, their several provisions, the dates of their enactments,\r\nthe privileges of our charters, the merits of the colonists, &c.\r\nhe shewed the pretensions to introduce the revenue acts, and these\r\narbitrary and mechanical writs of assistance, as an instrument for\r\nthe execution of them to be so irrational; by his wit he represented\r\nthe attempt as so ludicrous and ridiculous; and by his dignified\r\nreprobation of an impudent attempt to impose on the people of\r\nAmerica; he raised such a storm of indignation, that even Hutchinson,\r\nwho had been appointed on purpose to sanction this writ, dared not\r\nutter a word in its favour; and Mr. Gridley himself seemed to me to\r\nexult inwardly at the glory and triumph of his pupil.\r\n\r\nThis, I am sure, must be enough, at this time, and from this text to\r\nfatigue you, as it is more than enough to satisfy your most obedient,\r\n&c.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE HON. WM. TUDOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Quincy_, _August_ 11, 1818.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nThe \"Defence of the New England charters by Jer. Dummer,\" is, both\r\nfor style and matter, one of our most classical American productions.\r\n\"The feelings, the manners and principles which produced the\r\nrevolution,\" appear in as vast abundance in this work, as in any,\r\nthat I have read. This beautiful composition ought to be reprinted\r\nand read by every American who has learned to read. In pages 30 and\r\n31, this statute of 7th and 8th of king William, ch. 22. sec. 9th, is\r\nquoted, \"All laws, by-laws, usages or customs, at this time, or which\r\nhereafter shall be in practice, or endeavoured or pretended to be in\r\nforce or practice in any of the plantations, which are in any wise\r\nrepugnant to this present act, or any other law hereafter to be made\r\nin this kingdom, so far as such law shall relate to and mention the\r\nplantations, are illegal, null and void to all intents and purposes\r\nwhatsoever.\" This passage Mr. Otis quoted, with a very handsome\r\neulogium of the author and his book. He quoted it for the sake of\r\nthe rule established in it by parliament itself for the construction\r\nof its own statutes. And he contended that by this rule there could\r\nbe no pretence for extending writs of assistance to this country. He\r\nalso alluded to many other passages in this work, very applicable to\r\nhis purpose, which any man who reads it must perceive, but which I\r\nhave not time to transcribe.\r\n\r\nIf you, or your inquisitive and ingenious son, or either of my sons\r\nor grandsons or great grand sons, should ever think of these things,\r\nit may not be improper to transcribe from a marginal note at the end\r\nof this statute, an enumeration of the \"Further provisions concerning\r\nplantations.\" II. W. 3, c. 12; 3, 4 of An. c. 5 and 10; 6 of An. c.\r\n30; 8 of An. c. 13; 9th of An. c. 17; 10 An. c. 22 and 26; 4 Geo. 1,\r\nc. 11; 5 Geo. 1, c. 12 and 15; 13 Geo. 1, c. 5; 3 Geo. 2, c. 12 and\r\n28; 4 Geo. 2, c. 15; 5 Geo. 2, c. 7 and 9; 6 Geo. 2, c. 15; 8 Geo. 2,\r\nc. 13; 8 Geo. 2, c. 19; 12 Geo. 2, c. 30; 15 Geo. 2, c. 31 and 33; 24\r\nGeo. 2, c. 51 and 53; 29 Geo. 2, c. 5 and 35; and 30 Geo. 2, 9.\r\n\r\nThe vigilance of the crown officers and their learned counsel on one\r\nside, and that of merchants, patriots and their counsel on the other,\r\nproduced every thing in any of these statutes which could favor their\r\nrespective arguments. It would not only be ridiculous in me, but\r\nculpable to pretend to recollect all that were produced. Such as I\r\ndistinctly remember I will endeavour to introduce to your remembrance\r\nand reflections.\r\n\r\nMolasses or melasses or molosses, for by all these names, they are\r\ndesignated in the statutes. By the statute of the second year of our\r\nglorious deliverers, king William and queen Mary, session second,\r\nchapter four, section 35. \"For every hundred weight of molosses,\r\ncontaining 112 pounds, imported from any other place than the English\r\nplantations in America, eight shillings over and above what the same\r\nis charged within the book of rates.\"\r\n\r\nThe next statute that I recollect, at present, to have been\r\nintroduced upon that occasion, was the sixth of George the second,\r\nch. thirteen, \"An act for the better securing and encouraging the\r\ntrade of his majesty's sugar colonies in America.\"\r\n\r\nCost what it will, I must transcribe the first section of this\r\nstatute, with all its parliamentary verbiage. I hope some of my\r\nfellow citizens of the present or some future age will ponder it.\r\n\r\n\"Whereas, the welfare and prosperity of your majesty's sugar colonies\r\nin America, are of the greatest consequence and importance, to the\r\ntrade, navigation and strength of this kingdom; and whereas, the\r\nplanters of the said sugar colonies have of late years, fallen under\r\nsuch great discouragements, that they are unable to improve or carry\r\non the sugar trade, upon an equal footing with the foreign sugar\r\ncolonies, without some advantage and relief be given to them from\r\nG. Britain: For remedy whereof, and for the good and welfare of\r\nyour majesty's subjects, we your majesty's most dutiful and loyal\r\nsubjects, the commons of Great Britain, assembled in parliament, have\r\n_given and granted_ unto your majesty, the several and respective\r\nrates and duties hereinafter mentioned, and in such manner and\r\nform as is hereinafter expressed; and do most humbly beseech your\r\nmajesty, that it may be enacted, and be it enacted by the king's most\r\nexcellent majesty, by and with the consent of the lords spiritual\r\nand temporal, and commons in this present parliament assembled, and\r\nby the authority of the same, that from and after the twenty fifth\r\nday of December, one thousand seven hundred and thirty-three, there\r\nshall be raised, levied, collected, and paid, unto and for the use\r\nof his majesty, his heirs and successors, upon all rum or spirits of\r\nthe produce or manufacture of any of the colonies or plantations in\r\nAmerica, not in the possession or under the dominion of his majesty,\r\nhis heirs and successors, which at any time or times, within or\r\nduring the continuance of this act, shall be imported or brought\r\ninto any of the colonies or plantations in America, which now are,\r\nor hereafter may be, in the possession or under the dominion of his\r\nmajesty, his heirs or successors, the sum of nine pence, money of\r\nGreat Britain, to be paid according to the proportion and value of\r\nfive shillings and six pence the ounce in silver, for every gallon\r\nthereof, and after that rate for any greater or lesser quantity; and\r\nupon all molasses or syrups of such foreign produce or manufacture,\r\nas aforesaid, which shall be imported or brought into any of the said\r\ncolonies of or belonging to his majesty, the sum of six pence of like\r\nmoney for every gallon thereof, and after that rate for any greater\r\nor lesser quantity; and upon all sugars and paneles of such foreign\r\ngrowth, produce or manufacture as aforesaid, which shall be imported\r\ninto any of the said colonies or plantations of or belonging to his\r\nmajesty, a duty after the rate of five shillings of like money for\r\nevery hundred weight avoirdupois of the said sugar and paneles, and\r\nafter that rate for a greater or lesser quantity.\"\r\n\r\nNow, sir, will you be pleased to read judge Minot's history, vol. 2d,\r\nfrom page 137 to 140, ending with these words: \"But the strongest\r\napprehensions arose from the publication of the orders for the strict\r\nexecution of the molasses act, which is said to have caused a greater\r\nalarm in the country, than the taking of fort William Henry did in\r\nthe year 1757.\" This I fully believe, and certainly know to be true;\r\nfor I was an eye and an ear witness to both of these alarms. Wits\r\nmay laugh at our fondness for molasses, and we ought all to join in\r\nthe laugh with as much good humor as general Lincoln did. General\r\nWashington, however always asserted and proved, that Virginians\r\nloved molasses as well as New Englandmen did. I know not why we\r\nshould blush to confess that molasses was an essential ingredient in\r\nAmerican independence. Many great events have proceeded from much\r\nsmaller causes.\r\n\r\nMr. Otis demonstrated how these articles of molasses and sugar,\r\nespecially the former, entered into all and every branch of our\r\ncommerce, fisheries, even manufactures and agriculture. He asserted\r\nthis act to be a revenue law, a taxation law, made by a foreign\r\nlegislature without our consent, and by a legislature who had no\r\nfeeling for us, and whose interest prompted them to tax us to the\r\nquick. Pray, Mr. Tudor, calculate the amount of these duties upon\r\nmolasses and sugar. What an enormous revenue for that age! Mr. Otis\r\nmade a calculation and shewed it to be more than sufficient to\r\nsupport all the crown officers.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE HON. WM. TUDOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Quincy_, _August_ 16, 1818.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nWe cannot yet dismiss this precious statute of the 6th of George 2d.\r\nchapter 13.\r\n\r\nThe second section I must abridge, for I cannot transcribe much more.\r\nIt enacts, that all the duties imposed by the first section, shall be\r\npaid down in ready money by the importer, before landing.\r\n\r\nThe third section must be transcribed by me or some other person,\r\nbecause it is the most arbitrary among statutes, that were all\r\narbitrary, the most unconstitutional among laws, which were all\r\nunconstitutional.\r\n\r\nSection 3d. \"And be it further enacted, that in case any of the said\r\ncommodities shall be landed, or put on shore in any of his majesty's\r\nsaid colonies or plantations in America, out of any ship or vessel,\r\nbefore due entry be made thereof, at the port or place where the\r\nsame shall be imported, and before the duties by this act charged or\r\nchargeable thereupon, shall be duly paid, or without a warrant for\r\nthe landing and delivering the same, first signed by the collector,\r\nor impost officer, or other proper officer or officers of the custom\r\nor excise, belonging to such port or place respectively, all such\r\ngoods as shall be so landed or put on shore, or the value of the\r\nsame, shall be forfeited; and all and every such goods as shall be so\r\nlanded or put on shore, contrary to the true intent and meaning of\r\nthis act, shall, and may be seized by the governor or commander in\r\nchief, for the time being, of the colonies or plantations, where the\r\nsame shall be so landed or put on shore, or any person or persons, by\r\nthem authorized in that behalf, or by warrant of any Justice of the\r\npeace or other magistrate, (which warrant such justice or magistrate\r\nis hereby empowered and required to give upon request) or by any\r\ncustom house officer, impost, or excise officer, or any person or\r\npersons, him or them accompanying, aiding and assisting, and _all and\r\nevery such offence and forfeitures shall, and may be prosecuted for\r\nand recovered in any court of admiralty in his majesty's colonies\r\nor plantations in America, (which court of admiralty is hereby\r\nauthorized, impowered and required to proceed to hear, and finally\r\ndetermine the same) or in any court of record in the said colonies\r\nor plantations, where such offence is committed, at the election of\r\nthe informer or prosecutor, according to the course and method used\r\nand practised there in prosecutions for offences against penal laws\r\nrelating to customs or excise_; and such penalties and forfeitures\r\nso recovered there, shall be divided as follows, viz: one third part\r\nfor the use of his majesty, his heirs and successors, to be applied\r\nfor the support of the government of the colony or plantation,\r\nwhere thesame shall be recovered, one third part to the governor or\r\ncommander in chief, of the said colony or plantation, and the other\r\nthird part to the informer or prosecutor, who shall sue for the same.\"\r\n\r\nSection five contains the penalties on persons assisting in such\r\nunlawful importation.\r\n\r\nSection 6th. \"Fifty pound penalty on molesting an officer on his\r\nduty. Officer, if sued, may plead the general issue. Fifty pound\r\npenalty, on officer conniving at such fraudulent importation.\"\r\n\r\nSection 7th. \"One hundred pound penalty, on master of ship, &c.\r\npermitting such importation.\"\r\n\r\nSection 8th. \"The _onus probandi_ in suits to lie on the owners.\"\r\n\r\nSection 12. \"Charge of prosecution to be borne out of the king's part\r\nof seizures, forfeitures and penalties.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge 2d. was represented and believed in America to be an honest,\r\nwell meaning man; and although he consented to this statute and\r\nothers which he thought sanctioned by his predecessors, especially\r\nking William, yet it was reported and understood, that he had\r\nuniformly resisted the importunities of ministers, governors,\r\nplanters, and projectors, to induce him to extend the system of\r\ntaxation and revenue in America, by saying, that \"he did not\r\nunderstand the colonies; he wished their prosperity. They appeared to\r\nbe happy at present; and he would not consent to any innovations; the\r\nconsequences of which he could not foresee.\"\r\n\r\nSolomon, in all his glory, could not have said a wiser thing. If\r\nGeorge 3d. had adopted this sentiment, what would now be the state of\r\nthe world? Who can tell? or who can conjecture?\r\n\r\nThe question now was concerning the designs of a new reign, and of\r\na young prince. This young king had now adopted the whole system of\r\nhis predecessors, Stuarts, Oranges, and Hanoverians, and determined\r\nto carry it into execution, right or wrong; and that, by the most\r\ntyrannical instruments, that ever were invented; writs of assistance.\r\nWhat hope remained for an American, who knew, or imagined he knew,\r\nthe character of the English nation, and the character of the\r\nAmerican people? To borrow a French word, so many _reminiscences_\r\nrush upon me, that I know not which to select, and must return for\r\nthe present to Mr. Otis. By what means this young inexperienced king\r\nwas first tempted by his ministers, to enter with so much spirit into\r\nthis system, may be hereafter explained.\r\n\r\nMr. Otis analyzed this statute, 6. George 3d. c. 13, with great\r\naccuracy. His calculations may be made by any modern mathematician\r\nwho will take the pains. How much molasses, for example, was then\r\nsubject to this tax; suppose a million gallons, which is far less\r\nthan the truth. Six pence a gallon was full one half of the value\r\nof the article. It was sold at market for one shilling; and I have\r\nknown a cargo purchased at a pistareen. The duties on a million\r\ngallons, would then be twenty five thousand pounds sterling a year;\r\na fund amply sufficient, with the duties on sugars, &c. and more\r\nthan sufficient, at that time, to pay all the salaries of all the\r\ngovernors upon the continent, and all judges of admiralty too.\r\n\r\nMr. King, formerly of Massachusetts, now of New-York, in a late,\r\nluminous and masterly speech, in senate, page 18, informs us, from\r\nsure sources, that \"we import annually upwards of six million gallons\r\nof West India rum.\" The Lord have mercy on us! \"More than half of\r\nwhich comes from the English colonies. We also import every year,\r\nnearly seven millions of gallons of molasses; and as every gallon of\r\nmolasses yields, by distillation, a gallon of rum, the rum imported,\r\nadded to that distilled from molasses, is probably equal to twelve\r\nmillions of gallons, which enormous quantity is chiefly consumed,\r\nbesides whiskey, by citizens of the United States.\" Again, I devoutly\r\npray, the Lord have mercy on us!\r\n\r\nBut calculate the revenue, at this day, from this single act of\r\nGeorge 2d. It would be sufficient to bribe any nation, less knowing\r\nand less virtuous, than the people of America, to the voluntary\r\nsurrender of all their liberties.\r\n\r\nMr. Otis asserted this to be a revenue law; a taxation law; an\r\nunconstitutional law; a law subversive of every end of society\r\nand government; it was null and void. It was a violation of all\r\nthe rights of nature, of the English constitution, and of all\r\nthe charters and compacts with the colonies; and if carried into\r\nexecution by writs of assistance, and courts of admiralty, would\r\ndestroy all security of life, liberty, and property. Subjecting all\r\nthese laws to the jurisdiction of judges of admiralty, poor dependent\r\ncreatures; to the forms and course of the civil law, without juries,\r\nor any of the open, noble examination of witnesses, or publicity\r\nof proceedings, of the common law, was capping the climax, it was\r\nclenching the nail of American slavery.\r\n\r\nMr. Otis roundly asserted, that this statute, and the preceding\r\nstatutes, never could be executed. The whole power of Great Britain\r\nwould be ineffectual; and by a bold figure, which will now be thought\r\nexaggeration, he declared, that if the king of Great Britain in\r\nperson were encamped on Boston common, at the head of twenty thousand\r\nmen, with all his navy on our coast, he would not be able to execute\r\nthese laws. They would be resisted or eluded.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE HON. WM. TUDOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Quincy_, _August_ 21, 1818.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nMr. Otis quoted another author, \"The political and commercial works\r\nof Charles D'Avenant, L.L. D. vol. 2. discourse 3 On the plantation\r\ntrade.\" I cannot transcribe seventy six pages, but wish that\r\nAmericans of all classes would read them. They are in the same strain\r\nwith Downing, Child, Gee, Ashley, Charles 2, James 2, William and\r\nMary, William 3, Ann, George 2, and George 3; all conspiring to make\r\nthe people of North America hewers of wood and drawers of water, to\r\nplantation governors, custom house officers, judges of admiralty,\r\ncommon informers, West India planters, naval commanders, in the first\r\nplace; and, after all these worthy people should be amply supported,\r\nnourished, encouraged and pampered, if any thing more could be\r\nsqueezed from the hard earnings of the farmers, the merchants, the\r\ntradesmen and labourers in America, it was to be drawn into the\r\nexchequer in England, to aggrandize the British navy.\r\n\r\nMr. Otis proceeded to another species of statutes, relative to\r\nour internal policy, even our domestic manufactures and fireside\r\ncomforts; I might say, our homespun blankets and woollen sheets, so\r\nnecessary to cover some of us, if not all of us, in our slumbers\r\nin the long nights of our frozen winters. I shall refer to these\r\nstatutes as they occur, without any regard to order, and shall not\r\npretend to transcribe any of them.\r\n\r\n\"Furs of the plantations to be brought to Great Britain. 8 Geo. 1. c.\r\n15. ss. 24.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hats, not to be exported from one plantation to another. 5 Geo. 2.\r\nc. 22.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hatters in America, not to have more than two apprentices. 5 Geo. 2.\r\nc. 22. ss. 7.\"\r\n\r\n\"Slitting mills, steel furnaces, &c. not to be erected in the\r\nplantations. 23 Geo. 2. c. 29. ss. 9.\"\r\n\r\n\"No wool, or woollen manufacture of the plantations shall be\r\nexported. 10 & 11 Wm. 3. c. 10. ss. 19.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exporting wool, contrary to the regulations, forfeiture of the ship,\r\n&c. 12 Geo. 2. c. 21. ss. 11.\"\r\n\r\nI cannot search for any more of these mincing laws. Mr. Otis\r\nalternately laughed and raged against them all. He said one member\r\nof parliament had said, that a hobnail should not be manufactured in\r\nAmerica; and another had moved that Americans should be compelled\r\nby act of parliament, to send their horses to England to be shod.\r\nHe believed, however, that this last was a man of sense, and meant,\r\nby this admirable irony, to cast a ridicule on the whole selfish,\r\npartial, arbitrary and contracted system of parliamentary regulations\r\nin America.\r\n\r\nAnother statute there is, and was quoted by Mr. Otis, by which wool\r\nwas prohibited to be water-borne in America; in consequence of which,\r\na fleece of wool could not be conveyed in a canoe across a river or\r\nbrook, without seizure and forfeiture.\r\n\r\nBut I am wearied to death by digging in this mud; with searching\r\namong this trash, chaff, rubbish of acts of parliament; of that\r\nparliament which declared it had a right to legislate for us, as\r\nsovereign, absolute and supreme, in all cases whatsoever. But I\r\ndeny that they ever had any right to legislate for us, in any case\r\nwhatsoever. And on this point we are and were at issue, before God\r\nand the world. These righteous judges have decided the question; and\r\nit is melancholy that any Americans should still doubt the equity and\r\nwisdom of the decision.\r\n\r\nSuch were the bowels of compassion, such the tender mercies of our\r\npious, virtuous, our moral and religious mother country, towards her\r\nmost dutiful and affectionate children! Such they are still; and\r\nsuch they will be, till the United States shall compel that country\r\nto _respect_ this. To this end, poor and destitute as I am, I would\r\ncheerfully contribute double my proportion of the expense of building\r\nand equipping thirty ships of the line, before the year 1820.\r\n\r\nMr. Otis asserted all these acts to be null and void by the law of\r\nnature, by the English constitution, and by the American charters,\r\nbecause America was not represented in parliament. He entered into\r\nthe history of the charters. James the first and Charles the first,\r\ncould not be supposed to have ever intended that parliament, more\r\nhated by them both than the pope or the French king, should share\r\nwith them in the government of colonies and corporations which they\r\nhad instituted by their royal prerogatives--\"Tom, Dick, and Harry\r\nwere not to censure them and their council.\" Pym, Hambden, sir Harry\r\nVane and Oliver Cromwell did not surely wish to subject a country,\r\nwhich they sought as an asylum, to the arbitrary jurisdiction of a\r\ncountry from which they wished to fly. Charles the second had learned\r\nby dismal, doleful experience, that parliaments were not to be wholly\r\ndespised. He, therefore, endeavoured to associate parliament with\r\nhimself, in his navigation act, and many others of his despotic\r\nprojects, even in that of destroying, by his unlimited licentiousness\r\nand debauchery, the moral character of the nation. Charles the second\r\ncourted parliament as a mistress; his successors embraced her as a\r\nwife, at least for the purpose of enslaving America.\r\n\r\nMr. Otis roundly asserted this whole system of parliamentary\r\nregulations, and every act of parliament before quoted, to be\r\nillegal, unconstitutional, tyrannical, null and void. Nevertheless,\r\nwith all my admiration of Mr. Otis, and enthusiasm for his character,\r\nI must acknowledge he was not always consistent in drawing or\r\nadmitting the necessary consequences from his principles, one\r\nof which comprehended them all, to wit, that _Parliament had no\r\nauthority over America in any case whatsoever_.\r\n\r\nBut at present we must confine ourselves to his principles and\r\nauthorities in opposition to the acts of trade and writs of\r\nassistance. These principles I perfectly remember. The authorities in\r\ndetail I could not be supposed to retain; though with recollecting\r\nthe names, Vattel, Coke and Holt, I might have found them again by a\r\ndiligent search. But Mr. Otis himself has saved that trouble, by a\r\npublication of his own, which must be the subject of another letter\r\nfrom your humble servant,\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE HON. WM. TUDOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Quincy_, _August_ 31, 1818.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nI have before mentioned the instructions of the city of Boston to\r\ntheir representatives, in May 1764, printed in an appendix to Mr.\r\nOtis's \"Rights of the colonies.\" In obedience to those instructions,\r\nor at least in consequence of them Mr. Otis prepared a memorial\r\nto the house of representatives, which was by them voted to be\r\ntransmitted to Jasper Mauduit, Esq. agent for the province, only as\r\na statement drawn up by one of the house, to be improved as he may\r\njudge proper.\r\n\r\nIn this memorial Mr. Otis has preserved and immortalized his own\r\narguments and authorities to prove the acts of trade null and\r\nvoid, which he had advanced and produced three years before in his\r\noration against those acts and their formidable instrument, writs\r\nof assistance. This is a fortunate circumstance for me, because it\r\nrelieves me from the trouble of recollection, and the more painful\r\ntask of research in old books.\r\n\r\n\"The public transactions\", says Mr. Otis, \"from William the first, to\r\nthe revolution, may be considered as one continued struggle, between\r\nthe prince and the people, all tending to that happy establishment,\r\nwhich Great Britain has since enjoyed.\r\n\r\n\"The absolute rights of Englishmen, as frequently declared in\r\nparliament, from Magna Charta, to this time, are the rights of\r\npersonal security, personal liberty and of private property.\r\n\r\n\"The allegiance of British subjects being natural, perpetual and\r\ninseparable from their persons, let them be in what country they may;\r\ntheir rights are also natural, inherent and perpetual.\r\n\r\n\"By the laws of nature and of nations; by the voice of universal\r\nreason, and of God, when a nation takes possession of a desart,\r\nuncultivated, uninhabited country, or purchases of savages, as was\r\nthe case with far the greatest part of the British settlements;\r\nthe colonists transplanting themselves and their posterity, though\r\nseparated from the principal establishment, or mother country,\r\nnaturally become part of the state with its ancient possessions, and\r\nentitled to all the essential rights of the mother country. This\r\nis not only confirmed by the practice of the ancients, but by the\r\nmoderns ever since the discovery of America. Frenchmen, Spaniards,\r\nand Portuguese are no greater slaves abroad than at home; and\r\nhitherto Britons have been as free on one side of the Atlantic as on\r\nthe other: and it is humbly hoped that his majesty and the parliament\r\nwill in their wisdom be graciously pleased to continue the colonies\r\nin this happy state.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is presumed, that upon these principles, the colonists have been\r\nby their several charters declared natural subjects, and entrusted\r\nwith the power of making their own local laws, not repugnant to the\r\nlaws of England, and with the power of taxing themselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"This legislative power is subject to the same charter to the king's\r\nnegative as in Ireland. This effectually secures the dependence\r\nof the colonies on Great Britain. By the 13th of George 2. ch. 9.\r\neven foreigners having lived seven years in any of the colonies\r\nare deemed natives on taking the oaths of allegiance, &c. and are\r\ndeclared by the said act to be his majesty's natural born subjects\r\nof the kingdoms of Great Britain, to all intents, constructions and\r\npurposes, as if any of them had been born within the kingdom. The\r\nreasons given for this naturalization in the preamble of the act\r\nare, that the increase of the people is the means of advancing the\r\nwealth of any nation or country. And many foreigners and strangers,\r\nfrom the lenity of our government, the purity of our religion, the\r\nbenefit of our laws, the advantages of our trade, and the security\r\nof our property, might be induced to come and settle in some of\r\nhis majesty's colonies in America, if they were partakers of the\r\nadvantages and privileges, which the native born subjects there enjoy.\r\n\r\n\"The several acts of parliament and charters, declaratory of the\r\nrights and liberties of the colonies, are but in affirmance of the\r\ncommon law and law of nature in this point. There are, says my lord\r\nCoke, regularly three incidents to subjects born; 1. Parents under\r\nthe actual obedience of the king; 2. That the place of his birth be\r\nwithin the king's dominions; 3. The time of his birth to be chiefly\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\n\"For he cannot be a subject born of one kingdom, that was born under\r\nthe allegiance of a king of another kingdom. See Calvin's case and\r\nthe several acts and decisions on naturalization, from Edward the\r\nthird to this day. The common law is received and practised upon here\r\nand in the rest of the colonies; and all ancient and modern acts of\r\nparliament, that can be considered as part of or in amendment of the\r\ncommon law, together with such acts of parliament, as expressly name\r\nthe plantations, so that the power of the British parliament is held\r\nsacred and as uncontroulable in the colonies, as in England. The\r\nquestion is not upon the general power or right of the parliament;\r\nbut whether it is not circumscribed within some equitable and\r\nreasonable bounds? It is hoped it will not be considered as a new\r\ndoctrine, that even the authority of the parliament of Great Britain\r\nis circumscribed by certain bounds, which, if exceeded, their acts\r\nbecome those of mere power without right, and consequently void.\r\nThe judges of England have declared in favour of these sentiments,\r\nwhen they expressly declare, that acts of parliament against natural\r\nequity are void. That acts against the fundamental principles of\r\nthe British constitution are void. A very important question here\r\npresents itself. It essentially belongs to the society, both in\r\nrelation to the manner, in which it desires to be governed, and\r\nto the conduct of the citizens. This is called the legislative\r\npower.--The nation may entrust the exercise of it to the prince or to\r\nan assembly; or to an assembly and the prince jointly; who have then\r\na right of making new and abrogating old laws. It is here demanded\r\nwhether, if their power extends so far, as to the fundamental laws,\r\nthey may change the constitution of the state? The principles we\r\nhave laid down lead us to decide this point with certainty, that the\r\nauthority of these legislators does not extend so far, and that they\r\nought to consider the fundamental laws as sacred, if the nation has\r\nnot in very express terms given them the power to change them. For\r\nthe constitution of the state ought to be fixed; and since that was\r\nfirst established by the nation, which afterwards trusted certain\r\npersons with the legislative power, the fundamental laws are excepted\r\nfrom their commission. It appears that the society had only resolved\r\nto make provision for the state's being always furnished with laws,\r\nsuited to particular conjunctures, and gave the legislature for that\r\npurpose, the power of abrogating the ancient civil and political\r\nlaws, that were not fundamental, and of making new ones. But nothing\r\nleads us to think that it was willing to submit the constitution\r\nitself to their pleasure.\r\n\r\n\"When a nation takes possession of a distant country and settles\r\na colony there, that country though separated from the principle\r\nestablishment or mother country, naturally becomes a part of the\r\nstate equally with its ancient possessions. Whenever the political\r\nlaws or treaties make no distinction between them every thing said\r\nof the territory of a nation ought also to extend to its colonies.\r\nAn act of parliament made against natural equity, as to make a man\r\njudge in his own cause, would be void, Hob. 87. Trin. 12. Jac. Day\r\n_v._ Savage, S. C. & P. cited Arg. 10. Mod. 115. Hill 11. Ann C.\r\nB. in case of Thornby & Fleetwood, \"but says that this must be a\r\nclear case, and judges will strain hard rather than interpret an act\r\nvoid, _ab initio_.\" This is granted, but still their authority is\r\nnot boundless, if subject to the controul of the judges in any case.\r\nHolt, chief justice, thought what lord Coke says in Dr. Bonham's\r\ncase a very reasonable and true saying, that if an act of parliament\r\nshould ordain the same person both party and judge, in his own case,\r\nit would be a void act of parliament, and an act of parliament can\r\ndo no wrong, though it may do several things that look pretty odd;\r\nfor it may discharge one from the allegiance he lives under, and\r\nrestore to the state of nature, but it cannot make one that lives\r\nunder a government both party and judge, per Holt C. J. 12 Mod. 687.\r\n688. Hill 13. W. 3. B. R. in the case of the city of London _v._\r\nWood. It appears in our books, that in several cases, the common law\r\nshould controul acts of parliament, and sometimes adjudge them to be\r\nutterly void; for when an act of parliament against common right and\r\nreason, or repugnant and impossible to be performed, the common law\r\nshall controul it, and adjudge it to be void, and therefore, 8 E.\r\n3., 30. Thomas Tregor's case upon the statute of W. 2. cap. 38. and\r\nArt. Chart. 9. Herle said that sometimes statutes are made contrary\r\nto law and right, which the maker of them perceiving will not put\r\nthem into execution. This doctrine is agreeable to the law of nature\r\nand nations. and to the divine dictates of natural and revealed\r\nreligion. It is contrary to reason that the supreme power should\r\nhave a right to alter the constitution. This would imply that those\r\nwho are intrusted with sovereignty by the people, have a right to do\r\nas they please. In other words, that those, who are invested with\r\npower to protect the people and support their rights and liberties,\r\nhave a right to make slaves of them. This is not very remote from a\r\nflat contradiction. Should the parliament of Great Britain follow\r\nthe example of some other foreign states, Sweden, Denmark, France,\r\n&c. and vote the king absolute and despotic; would such an act of\r\nparliament make him so? Would any minister in his senses advise a\r\nprince to accept of such an offer of power? It would be unsafe to\r\naccept of such a donation because the parliament or donors would\r\ngrant more than it was in their power lawfully to give, the law of\r\nnature never invested them with a power of surrendering their own\r\nliberty, and the people certainly never intrusted any body of men\r\nwith a power to surrender theirs in exchange for slavery. But if the\r\nwhole state be conquered if the nation be subdued, in what manner\r\ncan a victor treat it without transgressing the bounds of justice?\r\nWhat are his rights over the conquest? Some have dared to advance\r\nthis monstrous principle, that the conqueror is absolute master over\r\nthis conquest, that he may dispose of it as his property, treat it as\r\nhe pleases, according to the common expression of treating a state\r\nas a conquered country, and hence they derive one of the sources of\r\ndespotic government.--But enough of those that reduce men to the\r\nstate of transferable goods, or use them like beasts of burden, who\r\ndeliver them up as the property or patrimony of another man. Let us\r\nargue upon principles countenanced by reason, and becoming humanity.\r\nThe whole right of the conqueror proceeds from the just defence of\r\nhimself, which contains the support and prosecution of his rights.\r\nThus when he has totally subdued a nation with whom he had been at\r\nwar, he may without dispute cause justice to be done him, with regard\r\nto what gave rise to the war, and require payment for the expense and\r\ndamage he has sustained; he may, according to the exigency of the\r\nplace, impose penalties on it as an example; he may, should prudence\r\nso dictate, disable it from undertaking any pernicious design for the\r\nfuture. But in securing all these views the mildest means are to be\r\npreferred. We are always to remember, that the law of nature permits\r\nno injury to be done to an enemy, unless in taking measures necessary\r\nfor a just defence and a reasonable security. Some princes have only\r\nimposed a tribute on it; others have been satisfied in stripping it\r\nof some of its privileges, dismembering it of a province, or keeping\r\nit in awe by fortresses; others, as their quarrel was only with the\r\nsovereign in person, have left a nation in the full enjoyment of\r\nits rights, only setting a sovereign over it. But if the conqueror\r\nthinks proper to retain the sovereignty of the vanquished state,\r\nand has such a right; the manner in which he is to treat the state\r\nstill flows from the same principles. If the sovereign be only the\r\njust object of his complaint, reason declares, that by his conquest\r\nhe acquires only such rights as actually belonged to the dethroned\r\nsovereign; and on the submission of his people he is to govern it\r\naccording to the laws of the state. If the people do not voluntarily\r\nsubmit, the state of war subsists. When a sovereign, as pretending to\r\nhave the absolute disposal of a people whom he has conquered, is for\r\nenslaving them, he causes the state of war to subsist between this\r\npeople and him. M. De Vattel, B. 3. c. 10. sec. 201.\r\n\r\n\"It is now near three hundred years since the continent of North\r\nAmerica was first discovered, and that by British subjects; the\r\nCabots discovered the continent before the Spaniards. Ten generations\r\nhave passed away, through infinite toils and bloody conflicts, in\r\nsettling this country. None of those ever dreamed, but that they were\r\nentitled at least to equal privileges with those of the same rank\r\nborn within the realm.\r\n\r\n\"British America has been hitherto distinguished from the slavish\r\ncolonies round about it, as the fortunate Britons have been from\r\nmost of their neighbours on the continent of Europe. It is for\r\nthe interest of Great-Britain that her Colonies be ever thus\r\ndistinguished. Every man must wilfully blind himself that does not\r\nsee the immense value of our acquisitions in the late war; and that\r\nthough we did not retain all at the conclusion of peace, that we\r\nobtained by the sword, yet our gracious sovereign, at the same time\r\nthat he has given a divine lesson of equitable moderation to the\r\nprinces of the earth, has retained sufficient to make the British\r\narms the dread of the universe, and his name dear to all posterity.\r\n\r\n\"To the freedom of the British constitution, and to their increase\r\nof commerce, it is owing, that our colonies have flourished without\r\ndiminishing the inhabitants of our mother country, quite contrary to\r\nthe effects of plantations, made by most other nations which have\r\nsuffered at home, in order to aggrandize themselves abroad. This\r\nis remarkably the case of Spain. The subjects of a free and happy\r\nconstitution of government, have a thousand advantages to colonize\r\nabove those who live under despotic princes.\r\n\r\n\"We see how the British colonies on the continent have outgrown those\r\nof the French; notwithstanding, they have ever engaged the savages\r\nto keep us back. Their advantages over us in the West Indies, are,\r\n1st. A capital neglect in former reigns, in suffering them to have\r\na firm possession of so many valuable islands, that we had a better\r\ntitle to than they. 2. The French, unable to push their settlements\r\neffectually on the continent, have bent their views to islands, and\r\npoured vast numbers into them. 3. The climate and business of these\r\nislands is by nature much better adapted to Frenchmen and to Negroes,\r\nthan to Britons. 4. The labour of slaves, black or white, will be\r\never cheaper than that of freemen, because that of individuals among\r\nthe former, will never be worth so much as with the latter; but this\r\ndifference is more than supplied, by numbers under the advantages\r\nabove mentioned. The French will ever be able to sell their West\r\nIndia produce cheaper, than our own islanders; and yet, while our own\r\nislanders can have such a price for theirs, as to grow much richer\r\nthan the French, or any other of the king's subjects in America, as\r\nis the case; and what the northern colonies take from the French, and\r\nother foreign islands, centers finally in return to Great Britain for\r\nher manufactures, to an immense value, and with a vast profit to her.\r\nIt is contrary to the first principles of policy to cloy such a trade\r\nwith duties; much more to prohibit it, to the risque, if not certain\r\ndestruction of the fishery.\r\n\r\n\"It is allowed by the most accurate British writers on commerce, Mr.\r\nPostlethwait in particular, who seems to favour the cause of the\r\nsugar islands, that one half of the immense commerce of Great Britain\r\nis with her colonies. It is very certain, that without the fishery,\r\nseven eighths of this commerce would cease. The fishery is the\r\ncentre of motion, upon which the wheel of all the British commerce\r\nin America turns. Without the American trade, would Britain, as a\r\ncommercial state, make any great figure at this day in Europe?\r\n\r\n\"Her trade in woollen and other manufactures is said to be lessening,\r\nin all parts of the world, but America, where it is increasing,\r\nand capable of infinite increase, from a concurrence of every\r\ncircumstance in its favour. Here is an extensive territory of\r\ndifferent climates, which, in time, will consume, and be able to pay\r\nfor as much manufactures as Great Britain and Ireland can make, if\r\ntrue maxims are pursued. The French, for reasons already mentioned,\r\ncan underwork, and consequently undersell the English manufactures\r\nof Great Britain, in every market in Europe. But they can send none\r\nof their manufactures here; and it is the wish of every honest\r\nBritish American, that they never may; it is best they never should.\r\nWe can do better without the manufactures of Europe, save those of\r\nGreat Britain, than with them. But without the West India produce\r\nwe cannot; without it our fishery must infallibly be ruined. When\r\nthat is gone, our own islands will very poorly subsist. No British\r\nmanufactures can be paid for by the colonists. What will follow?\r\nOne of these two things, both of which it is the interest of Great\r\nBritain to prevent. 1st. The northern colonists must be content to\r\ngo naked, and turn savages. Or 2d. become manufacturers of linnens\r\nand woollens, to clothe themselves; which, if they cannot carry to\r\nthe perfection of Europe, will be very destructive to the interests\r\nof Great Britain. The computation has been made, and that within\r\nbounds; and it can be demonstrated, that if North America is only\r\ndriven to the fatal necessity of manufacturing a suit of the most\r\nordinary linnen or woollen, for each inhabitant, annually, which may\r\nbe soon done, when necessity, the mother of invention shall operate,\r\nGreat Britain and Ireland will lose two millions per annum, besides a\r\ndiminution of the revenue to nearly the same amount. This may appear\r\nparadoxical; but a few years experience of the execution of the\r\nsugar act, will sufficiently convince the parliament, not only of the\r\ninutility, but destructive tendency of it, while calculations may be\r\nlittle attended to. That the trade with the colonies has been of a\r\nsurprising advantage to Great Britain, notwithstanding the want of a\r\ngood regulation, is past all doubt. Great Britain is well known to\r\nhave increased prodigiously, both in numbers and in wealth, since she\r\nbegan to colonize. To the growth of the plantations, Britain is, in a\r\ngreat measure, indebted for her present riches and strength. As the\r\nwild wastes of America have been turned into pleasant habitations and\r\nflourishing trading towns; so many of the little villages and obscure\r\nboroughs in Great Britain, have put on a new face, and all suddenly\r\nstarted up and become fair markets and manufacturing towns, and\r\nopulent cities. London itself, which bids fair to be the metropolis\r\nof the world, is five times more populous than it was in the days of\r\nqueen Elizabeth. Such are the fruits of the spirit of commerce and\r\nliberty. Hence it is manifested how much we all owe to that beautiful\r\nform of civil government, under which we have the happiness to live.\r\n\r\n\"It is evidently the interest, and ought to be the care of all those\r\nentrusted with the administration of government, to see that every\r\npart of the British empire enjoys to the full, the rights they are\r\nentitled to by the laws, and the advantages which result from their\r\nbeing maintained with impartiality and vigour. This we have seen\r\nreduced to practice in the present and preceding reigns; and have\r\nthe highest reason, from the paternal care and goodness that his\r\nmajesty, and the British parliament, have hitherto been graciously\r\npleased to discover to all his majesty's dutiful and loyal subjects,\r\nand to the colonists in particular, to rest satisfied, that our\r\nprivileges will remain sacred and inviolate. The connection between\r\nGreat Britain and her colonies is so natural and strong, as to make\r\ntheir mutual happiness depend upon their mutual support. Nothing can\r\ntend more to the destruction of both, and to forward the measures\r\nof their enemies, than sowing the seeds of jealousy, animosity, and\r\ndissention, between the mother country and the colonies.\r\n\r\n\"A conviction of the truth and importance of these principles,\r\ninduced Great Britain, during the late war, to carry on so many\r\nglorious enterprises for the defence of the colonies; and those on\r\ntheir part to exert themselves beyond their ability to pay, as is\r\nevident, from the parliamentary reimbursements.\r\n\r\n\"If the spirit of commerce was attended to, perhaps duties would\r\nbe every where decreased, if not annihilated, and prohibitions\r\nmultiplied. Every branch of trade, that hurts a community, should be\r\nprohibited for the same reason, that a private gentleman would break\r\noff commerce with a sharper, or an extensive usurer. It is to no\r\npurpose to higgle with such people; you are sure to loose by them. It\r\nis exactly so with a nation, if the balance is against them; and they\r\ncan possibly subsist without the commodities as they generally can\r\nin such cases, a prohibition is the only remedy; for a duty in such\r\na case, is like a composition with a thief, that for five shillings\r\nin the pound returned, he shall rob you at pleasure; when, if the\r\nthing is examined to the bottom, you are at five shillings expense\r\nin travelling to get back your five shillings; and he is at the same\r\nexpense in coming to pay it. So he robs you of but ten shillings\r\nin the pound, that you thus wisely compound for. To apply this to\r\ntrade, I believe every duty, that was ever imposed on commerce, or\r\nin the nature of things can be, will be found to be divided between\r\nthe state imposing the duty, and the country exported from. This,\r\nif between the several parts of the same kingdom or dominions of\r\nthe same prince, can only tend to embarrass trade, and raise the\r\nprice of labour above other states, which is of very pernicious\r\nconsequence to the husbandman, manufacturer, mariner and merchant,\r\nthe four tribes that support the whole hive. If your duty is upon a\r\ncommodity of a foreign state, it is either upon the whole useful and\r\ngainful; and therefore necessary for the husbandman, manufacturer,\r\nmariner or merchant, as finally bringing a profit to the state, by a\r\nbalance against your state. There is no medium that we know of. If\r\nthe commodity is of the former kind, it should be prohibited; but if\r\nthe latter, imported duty free, unless you would raise the price of\r\nlabour by a duty on necessaries, or make the above wise composition\r\nfor the importation of commodities, you are sure to lose by it.\r\n\r\n\"The only test of a useful commodity is the gain upon the whole\r\nto the state; such should be free; the only test of a pernicious\r\ntrade is the loss upon the whole or to the community; this should\r\nbe prohibited. If therefore it can be demonstrated, that the sugar\r\nand molasses trade from the northern colonies to the foreign\r\nplantations, is, upon the whole, a loss to the community, by which\r\nterm is here meant, the three kingdoms and the British dominions\r\ntaken collectively, then, and not till then, should this trade be\r\nprohibited. This never has been proved, nor can be; the contrary\r\nbeing certain, to wit: that the nation upon the whole hath been\r\na vast gainer by this trade, in the vend of and pay for its\r\nmanufactures; and a great loss by a study upon this trade will\r\nfinally fall on the British husbandman, manufacturer, mariner and\r\nmerchant; and consequently the trade of the nation be wounded, and in\r\nconstant danger of being eat out by those who can undersell her.\r\n\r\n\"The art of underselling, or rather of finding means to undersell, is\r\nthe grand secret of thrift among commercial states, as well as among\r\nindividuals of the same state. Should the British sugar islands ever\r\nbe able to supply Great Britain, and her northern colonies with those\r\narticles, it will be time enough to think of a total prohibition;\r\nbut until that time, both prohibition and duty will be found to be\r\ndiametrically opposite to the first principles of policy. Such is the\r\nextent of this continent, and the increase of its inhabitants, that\r\nif every inch of the British sugar islands was as well cultivated\r\nas any part of Jamaica or Barbadoes, they would not now be able\r\nto supply Great Britain, and the colonies on this continent. But\r\nbefore such further improvements can be supposed to take place in our\r\nislands, the demands will be proportionably increased by the increase\r\nof the inhabitants on the continent. Hence the reason is plain, why\r\nthe British sugar planters are growing rich, and demands on them,\r\never will be greater than they can possibly supply, so long as the\r\nEnglish hold this continent, and are unrivalled in the fishery.\r\n\r\n\"We have every thing good and great to hope from our gracious\r\nsovereign, his ministry and his parliament; and trust, that when the\r\nservices and sufferings of the British American colonies are fully\r\nknown to the mother country, and the nature and importance of the\r\nplantation trade more perfectly understood at home, that the most\r\neffectual measures will be taken for perpetuating the British empire\r\nin all parts of the world. An empire built upon the principles of\r\njustice, moderation and equity, the only principles that can make a\r\nstate flourishing, and enable it to elude the machinations of its\r\nsecret and inveterate enemies.\"\r\n\r\nExcuse errors, for I cannot revise and correct. I hope your patience\r\nwill never be put to the trial of another letter so long and dry.\r\nOne or two more, much shorter, will close the subject of writs of\r\nassistance, and relieve you from _ennui_, as well as your friend,\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE HON. WM. TUDOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Quincy_, _September_ 10, 1818.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nThe charters were quoted or alluded to by Mr. Otis frequently in the\r\nwhole course of his argument: but he made them also a more destined\r\nand more solemn head of his discourse. And here, these charters ought\r\nto be copied verbatim. But an immense verbiage renders it impossible.\r\nBishop Butler somewhere complains of this enormous abuse of words\r\nin public transactions, and John Reed and Theophilus Parsons of\r\nMassachusetts have attempted to reform it. So did James Otis; all\r\nwith little success. I hope, however, that their examples will be\r\nfollowed, and that common sense in common language will, in time,\r\nbecome fashionable. But the hope must be faint as long as clerks are\r\npaid by the line and the number of syllables in a line.\r\n\r\nSome passages of these charters must however, be quoted; and I will\r\nendeavour to strip them as well as I can, of their useless words.\r\nThey are recited in the charter of king William and queen Mary, dated\r\nthe seventh day of October, in the third year of their reign, _i. e._\r\nin 1691.\r\n\r\n\"Whereas king James the first, in the 18th year of his reign, did\r\ngrant to the council at Plymouth, for the planting and governing New\r\nEngland, all that part of America, from the 40th to the 48th degree\r\nof latitude, and from sea to sea, together with all sands, waters,\r\nfishings, and all and singular other commodities, _jurisdictions_,\r\nroyalties, privileges, franchises and pre-eminences, both within the\r\nsaid tract of land upon the main, and also within the islands and\r\nseas adjoining: to have and hold, all, unto the said council, their\r\nheirs and successors and assigns forever: to be holden of his said\r\nmajesty as of his manor of East Greenwich, in free and common socage,\r\nand not in capite, or by knights' service.--Yielding to the king a\r\nfifth part of the ore of gold and silver. _For and in respect of all\r\nand all manner of duties, demands and services whatsoever._\"\r\n\r\nBut I cannot pursue to the end this infinite series of words.--You\r\nmust read the charter again. For although you and I have read it\r\nfifty times, I believe you will find it, as I do, much stronger in\r\nfavour of Mr. Otis's argument than I expected or you will expect. I\r\ndoubt whether you will take the pains to read it again; but your son\r\nwill, and to him I recommend it.\r\n\r\nThe council of Plymouth, on the 19th of March, in the 3d year of the\r\nreign of Charles the first, granted to sir Henry Roswell and others,\r\npart of New England by certain boundaries, with all the prerogatives\r\nand privileges.\r\n\r\nKing Charles the first, on the 4th of March, in the fourth year of\r\nhis reign confirmed to sir Henry Roswell and others, all those lands\r\nbefore granted to them by the council of Plymouth. King Charles the\r\nfirst, created sir Henry Roswell and others, a body corporate and\r\npolitick. And said body politick, did settle a colony which became\r\nvery populous.\r\n\r\nIn 1684, in the 36th year of king William and queen Mary's _dearest\r\nuncle_, Charles the second, a judgment was given in the court of\r\nchancery, that the letters patent of Charles the first, should be\r\ncancelled, vacated and annihilated.\r\n\r\nThe agents petitioned to be re-incorporated; I can easily conceive\r\ntheir perplexity, their timidity, their uncertainty, their choice of\r\ndifficulties, their necessary preference of the least of a multitude\r\nof evils: for I have felt them all, as keenly as they did.\r\n\r\nWilliam and Mary unite Massachusetts, New Plymouth, the Province of\r\nMaine and Nova Scotia, into one province, to be holden in fee of the\r\nmanor of East Greenwich, paying one fifth of gold and silver ore.\r\n\r\nLiberty of conscience to be granted to all Christians, except\r\npapists. Good God! A grant from a king of liberty of conscience. Is\r\nit not a grant of the King of Kings, which no puppet or royalist upon\r\nearth can give or take away?\r\n\r\nThe general court impowered to erect judicatories and courts of\r\nrecord. The general court impowered to make laws, \"_not repugnant to\r\nthe laws of England_.\" Here was an unfathomable gulf of controversy.\r\nThe grant itself, _of liberty of conscience_, was repugnant to the\r\nlaws of England. Every thing was repugnant to the laws of England.\r\nThe whole system of colonization was beyond the limits of the laws of\r\nEngland, and beyond the jurisdiction of their national legislature.\r\nThe general court is authorized to impose fines, &c. and taxes.\r\n\r\nBut the fell paragraph of all, is the proviso in these\r\nwords:--\"Provided always, and it is hereby declared that nothing\r\nherein shall extend or be taken to erect or grant, or allow the\r\nexercise of any admiralty court jurisdiction, power, or authority,\r\nbut that the same shall be, and is hereby reserved to us and our\r\nsuccessors, and shall from time to time, be erected, granted and\r\nexercised by virtue of commissions to be issued under the great\r\nseal of England, or under the seal of the high admiral, or the\r\ncommissioners for executing the office of high admiral of England.\"\r\n\r\nThe history of this court of admiralty would require volumes.\r\nWhere are its records and its files? Its libels and answers? Its\r\ninterrogatories and cross interrogatories? All hurried away to\r\nEngland, as I suppose never to be seen again in America, nor probably\r\nto be inspected in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe records and files of the court of probate in Boston were\r\ntransported to Halifax. Judge Foster Hutchinson had the honour to\r\nreturn them after the peace of 1783. But admiralty records have never\r\nbeen restored as I have heard.\r\n\r\nThe subject may be pursued hereafter by your servant,\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE HON. WM. TUDOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Quincy_, _September_ 13, 1818.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nIt is some consolation to find in the paragraph of the charter,\r\nnext following the court of admiralty, that nothing in it \"shall\r\nin any manner enure, or be taken to abridge, bar, or hinder any of\r\nour loving subjects whatsoever, to use and exercise the trade of\r\nfishing upon the coasts of New England, but that they and every of\r\nthem shall have full and free power and liberty to continue and use\r\ntheir said trade of fishing upon the said coast, in any of the seas\r\nthereunto adjoining, or any arms of the said seas, or salt water\r\nrivers, where they have been wont to fish; and to build and sett,\r\nupon the lands within our said province or colony, lying waste, and\r\nnot then possessed by particular proprietors, such wharfs, stages,\r\nand work-houses, as shall be necessary for the salting, drying,\r\nkeeping and packing of their fish, to be taken and gotten upon that\r\ncoast; and to cut down and take such trees and other materials there\r\ngrowing or being upon any parts or places lying waste, and not then\r\nin possession of particular proprietors, as shall be needful for that\r\npurpose, and for all other necessary easments, helps and advantages,\r\nconcerning the trade of fishing there, in such manner and form, as\r\nthey have been heretofore at any time accustomed to do, without\r\nmaking any willful waste or spoil, any thing in these presents to the\r\ncontrary notwithstanding.\"\r\n\r\nFellow citizens! Recollect that \"This our province or colony\"\r\ncontained the whole of Nova Scotia as well as the \"Province of\r\nMaine, Massachusetts bay and New Plymouth.\" Will you ever surrender\r\none particle, one iota of this sacred charter right, and still\r\nmore sacred right of nature, purchase, acquisition, possession,\r\nusage, habit and conquest? Let the thunder of British cannon say\r\nwhat it will, I know you will not. I know you cannot. And if you\r\ncould be base enough to surrender it, which I know you cannot and\r\nnever will be, your sons will reclaim it, and redemand it, at the\r\nprice of whatever blood or treasure it may cost, and will obtain\r\nit, secure it, and command it, forever. This pretended _grant_ is\r\nbut an acknowledgment of your antecedent right by nature, and by\r\nEnglish liberty. You have no power or authority to alienate it. It\r\nwas granted, or rather acknowledged to your successors and posterity\r\nas well as to you, and any cessions you could make would be null and\r\nvoid in the sight of God and all reasonable men.\r\n\r\nMr. Otis descanted largely on these charters. His observations\r\ncarried irresistible conviction to the minds and hearts of many\r\nothers as well as to mine, that every one of those statutes from the\r\nnavigation act, to the last act of trade, was a violation of all the\r\ncharters and compacts between the two countries, was a fundamental\r\ninvasion of our essential rights, and was consequently null and\r\nvoid; that the legislatures of the colonies, and especially of\r\nMassachusetts, had the sole and exclusive authority of legislation\r\nand especially of taxation in America.\r\n\r\nThe indecision and inconsistency which appear in some of Mr. Otis's\r\nsubsequent writings is greatly to be regretted and lamented. They\r\nresemble those of colonel Bland, as represented by Mr. Wirt. I wish I\r\nhad Col. Bland's pamphlet, that I might compare it with some of Mr.\r\nOtis's.\r\n\r\nI have too many daily proofs of the infirmity of my memory to pretend\r\nto recollect Mr. Otis's reasoning in detail. If, indeed, I had a\r\ngeneral recollection of any of his positions, I could not express\r\nthem in that close, concise, nervous and energetic language, which\r\nwas peculiar to him, and which I never possessed.\r\n\r\nI must leave you, sir, to make your own observations and reflections\r\nupon these charters. But you may indulge me in throwing out a few\r\nhints, rather as queries or topicks of speculation, than as positive\r\nopinions. And here, though I see a wide field, I must make it narrow.\r\n\r\n1. Mr. Bollan was a kind of learned man, and of indefatigable\r\nresearch, and a faithful friend to America; though he lost all his\r\ninfluence when his father-in-law governor and general Shirley went\r\nout of circulation. This Mr. Bollan, printed a book very early on\r\nthe \"rights of the colonies.\" I scarcely ever knew a book so deeply\r\ndespised. The English reviews would not allow it to be the production\r\nof a rational creature. In America itself it was held in no esteem.\r\nOtis himself, expressed in the house of representatives, in a public\r\nspeech, his contempt of it in these words: \"Mr. Bollan's book is the\r\nstrangest thing I ever read; under the title of 'Rights of Colonies,'\r\nhe has employed one third of his work to prove that the world is\r\nround; and another, that it turns round; and the last, that the pope\r\nwas a devil for pretending to give it to whom he pleased.\"\r\n\r\nAll this I regretted. I wished that Bollan had not only been\r\npermitted, but encouraged to proceed. There was no doubt he would\r\nhave produced much in illustration of the ecclesiastical and\r\npolitical superstition and despotism of the ages when colonization\r\ncommenced and proceeded. But Bollan was discouraged and ceased from\r\nhis labours.\r\n\r\nWhat is the idea, Mr. Tudor, of British allegiance? And of European\r\nallegiance? Can you, or rather will you analize it? At present, I\r\nhave demands upon me, which compel me to close abruptly, with the\r\nusual regard of your friend,\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE HON. WM. TUDOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Quincy_, _September_ 18, 1818.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nThe English doctrine of allegiance is so mysterious, fabulous and\r\nenigmatical, that it is difficult to decompose the elements of which\r\nit is compounded. The priests, under the Hebrew economy, especially\r\nthe sovereign pontiffs, were anointed with consecrated oil, which\r\nwas poured upon their heads in such profusion, that it ran down\r\ntheir beards, and they were thence called \"the Lord's anointed.\"\r\nWhen kings were permitted to be introduced, they were anointed in\r\nthe same manner by the sovereign pontiff; and they too were called\r\n\"the Lord's anointed.\" When the pontiffs of Rome assumed the customs,\r\npomps and ceremonies of the Jewish priesthood, they assumed the\r\npower of consecrating things, by the same ceremony of \"holy oil.\"\r\nThe pope, who, as vicar of God, possessed the whole globe of earth\r\nin supreme dominion and absolute property, possessed also the power\r\nof sending the holy ghost wherever he pleased. To France it pleased\r\nhis holiness to send him in a phial of oil; to Rheims in the beak\r\nof a dove. I have not heard, that my friend, Louis 18th. has been\r\nconsecrated at Rheims by the pouring on of this holy oil; but his\r\nworthy elder brother, Louis 16th. was so consecrated at a vast\r\nexpense of treasure and ridicule. How the holy bottle was conveyed\r\nto England, is worth inquiry. But there it is, and is used at every\r\ncoronation; and is demurely, if not devoutly shewn to every traveller\r\nwho visits the tower. These ideas were once as firmly established in\r\nEngland, as they were in Rome; and no small quantity of the _relicks_\r\nof them remain to this day. Hence the doctrines of the divine right\r\nof kings, and the duties in subjects of unlimited submission,\r\npassive obedience and non-resistance, on pain (Oh, how can I write\r\nit) of eternal damnation. These doctrines have been openly and boldly\r\nasserted and defended, since my memory, in the town of Boston, and\r\nin the town of Quincy, by persons of no small consideration in the\r\nworld, whom I could name, but I will not, because their posterity are\r\nmuch softened from this severity.\r\n\r\nThis indelible character of sovereignty in kings, and obedience\r\nin subjects, still remains. The rights and duties are inherent,\r\nunalienable, indefeasible, indestructible and immortal. Hence the\r\nright of a lieutenant or midshipman of a British man of war, to\r\nsearch all American ships, impress every seaman his judgeship shall\r\ndecree by law, and in fact to be a subject of his king, and compel\r\nhim to fight, though it may be against his father, brother or son.\r\nMy countrymen! will you submit to these miserable remnants of\r\npriestcraft and despotism?\r\n\r\nThere is no principle of law or government, that has been more\r\ndeliberately or more solemnly adjudged in Great Britain, than that\r\nallegiance is not due to the king in his official capacity or\r\npolitical capacity, but merely to his personal capacity. Allegiance\r\nto parliament is no where found in English, Scottish or British laws.\r\nWhat, then, had our ancestors to do with parliament? Nothing more\r\nthan with the Jewish Sanhedrim, or Napoleon's literary and scientific\r\nInstitute at Grand Cairo. They owed no allegiance to parliament as\r\na whole, or in part. None to the house of lords, as a branch of the\r\nlegislature, nor to any individual peer or number of individuals.\r\nNone to the house of commons, as another branch, nor to any\r\nindividual commoner or group of commoners. They owed no allegiance\r\nto the nation, any more than the nation owed to them; and they had\r\nas good and clear a right to make laws for England, as the people of\r\nEngland had to make laws for them.\r\n\r\nWhat right, then, had king James 1st. to the sovereignty, dominion,\r\nor property of North America? No more than king George 3d. has to\r\nthe Georgium Sidus, because Mr. Herschell discovered that planet\r\nin his reign. His only colour, pretension or pretext is this. The\r\npope, as head of the church, was sovereign of the world. Henry 8th.\r\ndeposed him, became head of the church in England; and consequently\r\nbecame sovereign master and proprietor of as much of the globe as\r\nhe could grasp. A group of his nobles hungered for immense landed\r\nestates in America, and obtained from his _quasi holiness_ a large\r\ntract. But it was useless and unprofitable to them. They must have\r\nplanters and settlers. The sincere and conscientious protestants\r\nhad been driven from England into Holland, Germany, Switzerland,\r\n&c. by the terrors of stocks, pillories, croppings, scourges,\r\nimprisonments, roastings and burnings, under Henry 8th. Elizabeth,\r\nMary, James 1st. and Charles 1st. The noblemen and gentlemen of the\r\ncouncil of Plymouth wanted settlers for their lands in America, and\r\nset on foot a negotiation with the persecuted fugitive religionists\r\nabroad, promised them liberty of conscience, exemption from all\r\njurisdiction, ecclesiastical, civil and political, except allegiance\r\nto the king, and the tribute, moderate surely, of one fifth of gold\r\nand silver ore. This charter was procured by the council at Plymouth,\r\nand displayed off as a lure to the persecuted, fugitive Englishmen\r\nabroad; and they were completely taken into the snare, as Charles 2d.\r\nconvinced them in the first year of his actual, and the twelfth of\r\nhis imaginary reign. Sir Josiah Child, enemy as he was, has stated,\r\nin the paragraphs quoted from him in a former letter fairly and\r\ncandidly the substance of these facts.\r\n\r\nOur ancestors had been so long abroad, that they had acquired\r\ncomfortable establishments, especially in Holland, that singular\r\nregion of toleration, that glorious asylum for persecuted Hugunots\r\nand Puritans; that country where priests have been enternally\r\nworrying one another; and alternately teazing the government to\r\npersecute their antagonists, but where enlightened statesmen have\r\nconstantly and intrepidly resisted their wild fanaticism.\r\n\r\nThe first charter, the charter of James 1st. is more like a treaty\r\nbetween independent sovereigns, than like a charter of grant of\r\nprivileges from a sovereign to his subjects. Our ancestors were\r\ntempted by the prospect and promise of a government of their own,\r\nindependent in religion, government, commerce, manufactures,\r\nand every thing else, excepting one or two articles of trifling\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nIndependence of English church and state, was the fundamental\r\nprinciple of the first colonization, has been its general principle\r\nfor two hundred years, and now I hope is past dispute.\r\n\r\nWho then was the author, inventor, discoverer of independence? The\r\nonly true answer must be the first emigrants; and the proof of it\r\nis the charter of James 1st. When we say, that Otis, Adams, Mayhew,\r\nHenry, Lee, Jefferson, &c. were authors of independence, we ought to\r\nsay they were only awakeners and revivers of the original fundamental\r\nprinciple of colonization.\r\n\r\nI hope soon to relieve you from the trouble of this tedious\r\ncorrespondence with your humble servant,\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE HON. WM. TUDOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Quincy_, _September_ 23, 1818.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nIf, in our search of principles, we have not been able to investigate\r\nany moral, philosophical or rational foundation for any claim of\r\ndominion or property in America, in the English nation, their\r\nparliament or even of their king; if the whole appears a mere\r\nusurpation of fiction, fancy and superstition; what was the right to\r\ndominion or property in the native Indians?\r\n\r\nShall we say, that a few handfulls of scattering tribes of savages\r\nhave a right to dominion and property over a quarter of the globe,\r\ncapable of nourishing hundreds of happy human beings? Why had not\r\nEuropeans a right to come and hunt and fish with them?\r\n\r\nThe Indians had a right to life, liberty and property in common with\r\nall men; but what right to dominion or property beyond these? Every\r\nIndian had a right to his wigwam, his armour, his utensils; when he\r\nhad burned the woods about him, and planted his corn and beans, his\r\nsquashes and pompions, all these were his undoubted right: but will\r\nyou infer from this, that he had right of exclusive dominion and\r\nproperty, over immense regions of uncultivated wilderness, that he\r\nnever saw, that he might have the exclusive privilege of hunting and\r\nfishing in them, which he himself never expected or hoped to enjoy?\r\n\r\nThese reflections appear to have occurred to our ancestors; and their\r\ngeneral conduct was regulated by them. They do not seem to have had\r\nany confidence in their charter, as conveying any right, except\r\nagainst the king, who signed it. They considered the right to be in\r\nthe native Indians. And in truth all the right there was in the case,\r\nlay there. They accordingly respected the Indian wigwams and poor\r\nplantations; their clambanks and musclebanks and oysterbanks, and all\r\ntheir property.\r\n\r\nProperty in land, antecedent to civil society, or the social compact,\r\nseems to have been confined to actual possession and power of\r\ncommanding it. It is the creature of convention; of social laws and\r\nartificial order. Our ancestors, however, did not amuse themselves,\r\nnor puzzle themselves with these refinements. They considered the\r\nIndians as having rights; and they entered into negotiations with\r\nthem, purchased and paid for their rights and claims, whatever they\r\nwere, and procured deeds, grants, and quit claims of all their lands,\r\nleaving them their habitations, arms, utensils, fishings, huntings\r\nand plantations. There is scarcely a litigation at law concerning a\r\ntitle to land, that may not be traced to an Indian deed. I have in\r\nmy possession, somewhere, a parchment copy of a deed of Massasoit\r\nof the township of Braintree, incorporated by the legislature in\r\none thousand six hundred and thirty nine. And this was the general\r\npractice through the country, and has been to this day through\r\nthe continent. In short, I see not how the Indians could have\r\nbeen treated with more equity or humanity, than they have been in\r\ngeneral in North America. The histories of Indian wars have not been\r\nsufficiently regarded.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Hutchinson's history of Massachusetts bay first appeared,\r\none of the most common criticisms upon it, was the slight, cold and\r\nunfeeling manner in which he passed over the Indian wars. I have\r\nheard gentlemen the best informed in the history of the country, say,\r\n\"he had no sympathy for the sufferings of his ancestors,\" \"otherwise\r\nhe could not have winked out of sight, one of the most important,\r\nmost affecting, afflicting and distressing branches of the history of\r\nhis country.\"\r\n\r\nThere is somewhere in existence, as I hope and believe, a manuscript\r\nhistory of Indian wars, written by the Rev. Samuel Niles of\r\nBraintree. Almost sixty years ago, I was an humble acquaintance of\r\nthis venerable clergyman, then, as I believe more than four score\r\nyears of age. He asked me many questions, and informed me, in his own\r\nhouse, that he was endeavouring to recollect and commit to writing an\r\nhistory of Indian wars, in his own time, and before it, as far as he\r\ncould collect information. This history he completed and prepared for\r\nthe press: but no printer would undertake it, or venture to propose\r\na subscription for its publication. Since my return from Europe, I\r\nenquired of his oldest son, the Hon. Samuel Niles of Braintree, on a\r\nvisit he made me at my own house, what was become of that manuscript?\r\nHe laughed, and said it was still safe in the till of a certain\r\ntrunk; but no encouragement had ever appeared for its publication.\r\nYe liberal christians! Laugh not at me, nor frown upon me, for thus\r\nreviving the memory of your once formidable enemy. I was then no more\r\nof a disciple of his theological science than ye are now. But I then\r\nrevered and still revere the honest, virtuous and pious man. _Fas\r\nest et ab hoste doceri._ And his memorial of facts might be of great\r\nvalue to this country.\r\n\r\nWhat infinite pains have been taken and expenses incurred in\r\ntreaties, presents, stipulated sums of money, instruments of\r\nagriculture, education? What dangerous and unwearied labours to\r\nconvert the poor ignorant savages to christianity? And alas! with\r\nhow little success? The Indians are as bigotted to their religion as\r\nthe Mahometans are to their Koran, the Hindoos to their Shaster, the\r\nChinese to Confucius, the Romans to their Saints and Angels, or the\r\nJews to Moses and the Prophets. It is a principle of religion, at\r\nbottom, which inspires the Indians with such an invincible aversion\r\nboth to civilization and Christianity. The same principle has excited\r\ntheir perpetual hostilities against the colonists and the independent\r\nAmericans.\r\n\r\nIf the English nation, their parliaments and all their kings have\r\nappeared to be totally ignorant of all these things, or at least to\r\nhave vouchsafed no consideration upon them; if we, good patriotic\r\nAmericans have forgotten them, Mr. Otis had not. He enlarged on the\r\nmerit of our ancestors in undertaking so perilous, arduous, and\r\nalmost desperate an enterprize, in disforresting bare creation; in\r\nconciliating and necessarily contending with Indian natives; in\r\npurchasing rather than conquering a quarter of the globe at their own\r\nexpense, at the sweat of their own brows; at the hazard and sacrifice\r\nof their own lives; without the smallest aid, assistance or comfort\r\nfrom the government of England, or from England itself as a nation.\r\nOn the contrary, constant jealousy, envy, intrigue against their\r\ncharter, their religion and all their privileges. Laud, the pious\r\ntyrant dreaded them, as he foresaw they would overthrow his religion.\r\n\r\nMr. Otis reproached the nation, parliaments and kings with injustice,\r\nungenerosity, ingratitude, cruelty and perfidy in all their conduct\r\ntowards this country, in a style of oratory that I never heard\r\nequalled in this or any other country.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS.",
