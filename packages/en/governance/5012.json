The assurances, indeed, of friendly\r\ndisposition received from all the powers with whom we have principle\r\nrelations had inspired a confidence that our peace with them would not have\r\nbeen disturbed. But a cessation of irregularities which had affected the\r\ncommerce of neutral nations and of the irritations and injuries produced by\r\nthem can not but add to this confidence, and strengthens at the same time\r\nthe hope that wrongs committed on unoffending friends under a pressure of\r\ncircumstances will now be reviewed with candor, and will be considered as\r\nfounding just claims of retribution for the past and new assurance for the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nAmong our Indian neighbors also a spirit of peace and friendship generally\r\nprevails, and I am happy to inform you that the continued efforts to\r\nintroduce among them the implements and the practice of husbandry and the\r\nhousehold arts have not been without success; that they are becoming more\r\nand more sensible of the superiority of this dependence for clothing and\r\nsubsistence over the precarious resources of hunting and fishing, and\r\nalready we are able to announce that instead of that constant diminution of\r\ntheir numbers produced by their wars and their wants, some of them begin to\r\nexperience an increase of population.\r\n\r\nTo this state of general peace with which we have been blessed, one only\r\nexception exists. Tripoli, the least considerable of the Barbary States,\r\nhad come forward with demands unfounded either in right or in compact, and\r\nhad permitted itself to denounce war on our failure to comply before a\r\ngiven day. The style of the demand admitted but one answer.\r\n\r\nI sent a small squadron of frigates into the Mediterranean, with assurances\r\nto that power of our sincere desire to remain in peace, but with orders to\r\nprotect our commerce against the threatened attack. The measure was\r\nseasonable and salutary. The Bey had already declared war. His cruisers\r\nwere out. Two had arrived at Gibraltar. Our commerce in the Mediterranean\r\nwas blockaded and that of the Atlantic in peril.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of our squadron dispelled the danger. One of the Tripolitan\r\ncruisers having fallen in with and engaged the small schooner Enterprise,\r\ncommanded by Lieutenant Sterret, which had gone as a tender to our larger\r\nvessels, was captured, after a heavy slaughter of her men, without the loss\r\nof a single one on our part. The bravery exhibited by our citizens on that\r\nelement will, I trust, be a testimony to the world that it is not the want\r\nof that virtue which makes us seek their peace, but a conscientious desire\r\nto direct the energies of our nation to the multiplication of the human\r\nrace, and not to its destruction. Unauthorized by the Constitution, without\r\nthe sanction of Congress, to go beyond the line of defense, the vessel,\r\nbeing disabled from committing further hostilities, was liberated with its\r\ncrew.\r\n\r\nThe Legislature will doubtless consider whether, by authorizing measures of\r\noffense also, they will place our force on an equal footing with that of\r\nits adversaries. I communicate all material information on this subject,\r\nthat in the exercise of this important function confided by the\r\nConstitution to the Legislature exclusively their judgment may form itself\r\non a knowledge and consideration of every circumstance of weight.\r\n\r\nI wish I could say that our situation with all the other Barbary States was\r\nentirely satisfactory. Discovering that some delays had taken place in the\r\nperformance of certain articles stipulated by us, I thought it my duty, by\r\nimmediate measures for fulfilling them, to vindicate to ourselves the right\r\nof considering the effect of departure from stipulation on their side. From\r\nthe papers which will be laid before you you will be enabled to judge\r\nwhether our treaties are regarded by them as fixing at all the measure of\r\ntheir demands or as guarding from the exercise of force our vessels within\r\ntheir power, and to consider how far it will be safe and expedient to leave\r\nour affairs with them in their present posture.\r\n\r\nI lay before you the result of the census lately taken of our inhabitants,\r\nto a conformity with which we are now to reduce the ensuing ration of\r\nrepresentation and taxation. You will perceive that the increase of numbers\r\nduring the last 10 years, proceeding in geometric ratio, promises a\r\nduplication in little more than 22 years. We contemplate this rapid growth\r\nand the prospect it holds up to us, not with a view to the injuries it may\r\nenable us to do others in some future day, but to the settlement of the\r\nextensive country still remaining vacant within our limits to the\r\nmultiplication of men susceptible of happiness, educated in the love of\r\norder, habituated to self-government, and valuing its blessings above all\r\nprice.\r\n\r\nOther circumstances, combined with the increase of numbers, have produced\r\nan augmentation of revenue arising from consumption in a ratio far beyond\r\nthat of population alone; and though the changes in foreign relations now\r\ntaking place so desirably for the whole world may for a season affect this\r\nbranch of revenue, yet weighing all probabilities of expense as well as of\r\nincome, there is reasonable ground of confidence that we may now safely\r\ndispense with all the internal taxes, comprehending excise, stamps,\r\nauctions, licenses, carriages, and refined sugars, to which the postage on\r\nnews papers may be added to facilitate the progress of information, and\r\nthat the remaining sources of revenue will be sufficient to provide for the\r\nsupport of Government, to pay the interest of the public debts, and to\r\ndischarge the principals within shorter periods than the laws or the\r\ngeneral expectation had contemplated.\r\n\r\nWar, indeed, and untoward events may change this prospect of things and\r\ncall for expenses which imposts could not meet; but sound principles will\r\nnot justify our taxing the industry of our fellow citizens to accumulate\r\ntreasure for wars to happen we know not when, and which might not, perhaps,\r\nhappen but from the temptations offered by that treasure.\r\n\r\nThese views, however, of reducing our burthens are formed on the\r\nexpectation that a sensible and at the same time a salutary reduction may\r\ntake place in our habitual expenditures. For this purpose those of the\r\ncivil Government, the Army, and Navy will need revisal.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider that this Government is charged with the external and\r\nmutual relations only of these States; that the States themselves have\r\nprincipal care of our persons, our property, and our reputation,\r\nconstituting the great field of human concerns, we may well doubt whether\r\nour organization is not too complicated, too expensive; whether offices and\r\nofficers have not been multiplied unnecessarily and sometimes injuriously\r\nto the service they were meant to promote.\r\n\r\nI will cause to be laid before you an essay toward a statement of those\r\nwho, under public employment of various kinds, draw money from the Treasury\r\nor from our citizens. Time has not permitted a perfect enumeration, the\r\nramifications of office being too multiplied and remote to be completely\r\ntraced in a first trial.\r\n\r\nAmong those who are dependent on Executive discretion I have begun the\r\nreduction of what was deemed unnecessary. The expenses of diplomatic agency\r\nhave been considerably diminished. The inspectors of internal revenue who\r\nwere found to obstruct the accountability of the institution have been\r\ndiscontinued. Several agencies created by Executive authorities, on\r\nsalaries fixed by that also, have been suppressed, and should suggest the\r\nexpediency of regulating that power by law, so as to subject its exercises\r\nto legislative inspection and sanction.\r\n\r\nOther reformations of the same kind will be pursued with that caution which\r\nis requisite in removing useless things, not to injure what is retained.\r\nBut the great mass of public offices is established by law, and therefore\r\nby law alone can be abolished. Should the Legislature think it expedient to\r\npass this roll in review and try all its parts by the test of public\r\nutility, they may be assured of every aid and light which Executive\r\ninformation can yield.\r\n\r\nConsidering the general tendency to multiply offices and dependencies and\r\nto increase expense to the ultimate term of burthen which the citizen can\r\nbear, it behooves us to avail ourselves of every occasion which presents\r\nitself for taking off the surcharge, that it never may be seen here that\r\nafter leaving to labor the smallest portion of its earnings on which it can\r\nsubsist, Government shall itself consume the whole residue of what it was\r\ninstituted to guard.\r\n\r\nIn our care, too, of the public contributions intrusted to our direction it\r\nwould be prudent to multiply barriers against their dissipation by\r\nappropriating specific sums to every specific purpose susceptible of\r\ndefinition; by disallowing all applications of money varying from the\r\nappropriation in object or transcending it in amount; by reducing the\r\nundefined field of contingencies and thereby circumscribing discretionary\r\npowers over money, and by bringing back to a single department all\r\naccountabilities for money, where the examinations may be prompt,\r\nefficacious, and uniform.\r\n\r\nAn account of the receipts and expenditures of the last year, as prepared\r\nby the Secretary of the Treasury, will, as usual, be laid before you. The\r\nsuccess which has attended the late sales of the public lands shews that\r\nwith attention they may be made an important source of receipt. Among the\r\npayments those made in discharge of the principal and interest of the\r\nnational debt will shew that the public faith has been exactly maintained.\r\nTo these will be added an estimate of appropriations necessary for the\r\nensuing year. This last will, of course, be affected by such modifications\r\nof the system of expense as you shall think proper to adopt.\r\n\r\nA statement has been formed by the Secretary of War, on mature\r\nconsideration, of all the posts and stations where garrisons will be\r\nexpedient and of the number of men requisite for each garrison. The whole\r\namount is considerably short of the present military establishment. For the\r\nsurplus no particular use can be pointed out.\r\n\r\nFor defense against invasion their number is as nothing, nor is it\r\nconceived needful or safe that a standing army should be kept up in time of\r\npeace for that purpose. Uncertain as we must ever be of the particular\r\npoint in our circumference where an enemy may choose to invade us, the only\r\nforce which can be ready at every point and competent to oppose them is the\r\nbody of the neighboring citizens as formed into a militia. On these,\r\ncollected from the parts most convenient in numbers proportioned to the\r\ninvading force, it is best to rely not only to meet the first attack, but if\r\nit threatens to be permanent to maintain the defense until regulars may be\r\nengaged to relieve them. These considerations render it important that we\r\nshould at every session continue to amend the defects which from time to\r\ntime shew themselves in the laws for regulating the militia until they are\r\nsufficiently perfect. Nor should we now or at any time separate until we\r\nsay we have done everything for the militia which we could do were an enemy\r\nat our door.\r\n\r\nThe provision of military stores on hand will be laid before you, that you\r\nmay judge of the additions still requisite.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the extent to which our naval preparations should be\r\nexpected to appear, but just attention to the circumstances of every part\r\nof the Union will doubtless reconcile all. A small force will probably\r\ncontinue to be wanted for actual service in the Mediterranean. Whatever\r\nannual sum beyond that you may think proper to appropriate to naval\r\npreparations would perhaps be better employed in providing those articles\r\nwhich may be kept without waste or consumption, and be in readiness when\r\nany exigence calls them into use. Progress has been made, as will appear by\r\npapers now communicated, in providing materials for 74-gun ships as\r\ndirected by law.\r\n\r\nHow far the authority given by the Legislature for procuring and\r\nestablishing sites for naval purposes has been perfectly understood and\r\npursued in the execution admits of some doubt. A statement of the expenses\r\nalready incurred on that subject is now laid before you. I have in certain\r\ncases suspended or slackened these expenditures, that the Legislature might\r\ndetermine whether so many yards are necessary as have been contemplated.\r\n\r\nThe works at this place are among those permitted to go on, and 5 of the 7\r\nfrigates directed to be laid up have been brought and laid up here, where,\r\nbesides the safety of their position, they are under the eye of the\r\nExecutive Administration, as well as of its agents, and where yourselves\r\nalso will be guided by your own view in the legislative provisions\r\nrespecting them which may from time to time be necessary. They are\r\npreserved in such condition, as well the vessels as whatever belongs to\r\nthem, as to be at all times ready for sea on a short warning. Two others\r\nare yet to be laid up so soon as they shall have received the repairs\r\nrequisite to put them also into sound condition. As a superintending\r\nofficer will be necessary at each yard, his duties and emoluments, hitherto\r\nfixed by the Executive, will be a more proper subject for legislation. A\r\ncommunication will also be made of our progress in the execution of the law\r\nrespecting the vessels directed to be sold.\r\n\r\nThe fortifications of our harbors, more or less advanced, present\r\nconsiderations of great difficulty. While some of them are on a scale\r\nsufficiently proportioned to the advantages of their position, to the\r\nefficacy of their protection, and the importance of the points within it,\r\nothers are so extensive, will cost so much in their first erection, so much\r\nin their maintenance, and require such a force to garrison them as to make\r\nit questionable what is best now to be done. A statement of those commenced\r\nor projected, of the expenses already incurred, and estimates of their\r\nfuture cost, as far as can be foreseen, shall be laid before you, that you\r\nmay be enabled to judge whether any alteration is necessary in the laws\r\nrespecting this subject.\r\n\r\nAgriculture, manufactures, commerce, and navigation, the four pillars of our\r\nprosperity, are then most thriving when left most free to individual\r\nenterprise. Protection from casual embarrassments, however, may sometimes\r\nbe seasonably interposed. If in the course of your observations or\r\ninquiries they should appear to need any aid within the limits of our\r\nconstitutional powers, your sense of their importance is a sufficient\r\nassurance they will occupy your attention. We can not, indeed, but all feel\r\nan anxious solicitude for the difficulties under which our carrying trade\r\nwill soon be placed. How far it can be relieved, otherwise than by time, is\r\na subject of important consideration.\r\n\r\nThe judiciary system of the United States, and especially that portion of\r\nit recently erected, will of course present itself to the contemplation of\r\nCongress, and, that they may be able to judge of the proportion which the\r\ninstitution bears on the business it has to perform, I have caused to be\r\nprocured from the several States and now lay before Congress an exact\r\nstatement of all the causes decided since the first establishment of the\r\ncourts, and of those which were depending when additional courts and judges\r\nwere brought in to their aid.\r\n\r\nAnd while on the judiciary organization it will be worthy your\r\nconsideration whether the protection of the inestimable institution of\r\njuries has been extended to all the cases involving the security of our\r\npersons and property. Their impartial selection also being essential to\r\ntheir value, we ought further to consider whether that is sufficiently\r\nsecured in those States where they are named by a marshal depending on\r\nExecutive will or designated by the court or by officers dependent on\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nI can not omit recommending a revisal of the laws on the subject of\r\nnaturalization. Considering the ordinary chances of human life, a denial of\r\ncitizenship under a residence of 14 years is a denial to a great proportion\r\nof those who ask it, and controls a policy pursued from their first\r\nsettlement by many of these States, and still believed of consequence to\r\ntheir prosperity; and shall we refuse to the unhappy fugitives from\r\ndistress that hospitality which the savages of the wilderness extended to\r\nour fathers arriving in this land? Shall oppressed humanity find no asylum\r\non this globe? The Constitution indeed has wisely provided that for\r\nadmission to certain offices of important trust a residence shall be\r\nrequired sufficient to develop character and design. But might not the\r\ngeneral character and capabilities of a citizen be safely communicated to\r\neveryone manifesting a bona fide purpose of embarking his life and fortunes\r\npermanently with us, with restrictions, perhaps, to guard against the\r\nfraudulent usurpation of our flag, an abuse which brings so much\r\nembarrassment and loss on the genuine citizen and so much danger to the\r\nnation of being involved in war that no endeavor should be spared to detect\r\nand suppress it?\r\n\r\nThese, fellow citizens, are the matters respecting the state of the nation\r\nwhich I have thought of importance to be submitted to your consideration at\r\nthis time. Some others of less moment or not yet ready for communication\r\nwill be the subject of separate messages. I am happy in this opportunity of\r\ncommitting the arduous affairs of our Government to the collected wisdom of\r\nthe Union. Nothing shall be wanting on my part to inform as far as in my\r\npower the legislative judgment, nor to carry that judgment into faithful\r\nexecution.\r\n\r\nThe prudence and temperance of your discussions will promote within your\r\nown walls that conciliation which so much befriends rational conclusion,\r\nand by its example will encourage among our constituents that progress of\r\nopinion which is tending to unite them in object and in will. That all\r\nshould be satisfied with any one order of things is not to be expected; but\r\nI indulge the pleasing persuasion that the great body of our citizens will\r\ncordially concur in honest and disinterested efforts which have for their\r\nobject to preserve the General and State Governments in their\r\nconstitutional form and equilibrium; to maintain peace abroad, and order\r\nand obedience to the laws at home; to establish principles and practices of\r\nadministration favorable to the security of liberty and property, and to\r\nreduce expenses to what is necessary for the useful purposes of Government.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nThomas Jefferson\r\nDecember 15, 1802\r\n\r\nTo the Senate and House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nWhen we assemble together, fellow citizens, to consider the state of our\r\nbeloved country, our just attentions are first drawn to those pleasing\r\ncircumstances which mark the goodness of that Being from whose favor they\r\nflow and the large measure of thankfulness we owe for His bounty. Another\r\nyear has come around, and finds us still blessed with peace and friendship\r\nabroad; law, order, and religion at home; good affection and harmony with\r\nour Indian neighbors; our burthens lightened, yet our income sufficient for\r\nthe public wants, and the produce of the year great beyond example. These,\r\nfellow citizens, are the circumstances under which we meet, and we remark\r\nwith special satisfaction those which under the smiles of Providence result\r\nfrom the skill, industry, and order of our citizens, managing their own\r\naffairs in their own way and for their own use, unembarrassed by too much\r\nregulation, unoppressed by fiscal exactions.\r\n\r\nOn the restoration of peace in Europe that portion of the general carrying\r\ntrade which had fallen to our share during the war was abridged by the\r\nreturning competition of the belligerent powers. This was to be expected,\r\nand was just. But in addition we find in some parts of Europe monopolizing\r\ndiscriminations, which in the form of duties tend effectually to prohibit\r\nthe carrying thither our own produce in our own vessels. From existing\r\namities and a spirit of justice it is hoped that friendly discussion will\r\nproduce a fair and adequate reciprocity. But should false calculations of\r\ninterest defeat our hope, it rests with the Legislature to decide whether\r\nthey will meet inequalities abroad with countervailing inequalities at\r\nhome, or provide for the evil in any other way.\r\n\r\nIt is with satisfaction I lay before you an act of the British Parliament\r\nanticipating this subject so far as to authorize a mutual abolition of the\r\nduties and countervailing duties permitted under the treaty of 1794. It\r\nshows on their part a spirit of justice and friendly accommodation which it\r\nis our duty and our interest to cultivate with all nations. Whether this\r\nwould produce a due equality in the navigation between the two countries is\r\na subject for your consideration.\r\n\r\nAnother circumstance which claims attention as directly affecting the very\r\nsource of our navigation is the defect or the evasion of the law providing\r\nfor the return of sea men, and particularly of those belonging to vessels\r\nsold abroad. Numbers of them, discharged in foreign ports, have been thrown\r\non the hands of our consuls, who, to rescue them from the dangers into\r\nwhich their distresses might plunge them and save them to their country,\r\nhave found it necessary in some cases to return them at the public charge.\r\n\r\nThe cession of the Spanish Province of Louisiana to France, which took\r\nplace in the course of the late war, will, if carried into effect, make a\r\nchange in the aspect of our foreign relations which will doubtless have\r\njust weight in any deliberations of the Legislature connected with that\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nThere was reason not long since to apprehend that the warfare in which we\r\nwere engaged with Tripoli might be taken up by some other of the Barbary\r\nPowers. A reenforcement, therefore, was immediately ordered to the vessels\r\nalready there. Subsequent information, however, has removed these\r\napprehensions for the present. To secure our commerce in that sea with the\r\nsmallest force competent, we have supposed it best to watch strictly the\r\nharbor of Tripoli. Still, however, the shallowness of their coast and the\r\nwant of smaller vessels on our part has permitted some cruisers to escape\r\nunobserved, and to one of these an American vessel unfortunately fell prey.\r\nThe captain, one American sea man, and two others of color remain prisoners\r\nwith them unless exchanged under an agreement formerly made with the\r\nBashaw, to whom, on the faith of that, some of his captive subjects had\r\nbeen restored.\r\n\r\nThe convention with the State of Georgia has been ratified by their\r\nlegislature, and a repurchase from the Creeks has been consequently made of\r\na part of the Talasscee country. In this purchase has been also\r\ncomprehended a part of the lands within the fork of Oconee and Oakmulgee\r\nrivers. The particulars of the contract will be laid before Congress so\r\nsoon as they shall be in a state for communication.\r\n\r\nIn order to remove every ground of difference possible with our Indian\r\nneighbors, I have proceeded in the work of settling with them and marking\r\nthe boundaries between us. That with the Choctaw Nation is fixed in one\r\npart and will be through the whole within a short time. The country to\r\nwhich their title had been extinguished before the Revolution is sufficient\r\nto receive a very respectable population, which Congress will probably see\r\nthe expediency of encouraging so soon as the limits shall be declared. We\r\nare to view this position as an outpost of the United States, surrounded by\r\nstrong neighbors and distant from its support; and how far that monopoly\r\nwhich prevents population should here be guarded against and actual\r\nhabitation made a condition of the continuance of title will be for your\r\nconsideration. A prompt settlement, too, of all existing rights and claims\r\nwithin this territory presents itself as a preliminary operation.\r\n\r\nIn that part of the Indiana Territory which includes Vincennes the lines\r\nsettled with the neighboring tribes fix the extinction of their title at a\r\nbreadth of 24 leagues from east to west and about the same length parallel\r\nwith and including the Wabash. They have also ceded a tract of 4 miles\r\nsquare, including the salt springs near the mouth of that river.\r\n\r\nIn the Department of Finance it is with pleasure I inform you, that the\r\nreceipts of external duties for the last 12 months have exceeded those of\r\nany former year, and that the ration of increase has been also greater than\r\nusual. This has enabled us to answer all the regular exigencies of\r\nGovernment, to pay from the Treasury within one year upward of $8 millions,\r\nprincipal and interest, of the public debt, exclusive of upward of $1\r\nmillion paid by the sale of bank stock, and making in the whole a\r\nreduction of nearly $5.5 millions of principal, and to have now in the\r\nTreasury $4.5 millions which are in a course of application to the\r\nfurther discharge of debt and current demands. Experience, too, so far,\r\nauthorizes us to believe, if no extraordinary event supervenes, and the\r\nexpenses which will be actually incurred shall not be greater than were\r\ncontemplated by Congress at their last session, that we shall not be\r\ndisappointed in the expectations then formed. But nevertheless, as the\r\neffect of peace on the amount of duties is not yet fully ascertained, it\r\nis the more necessary to practice every useful economy and to incur no\r\nexpense which may be avoided without prejudice.\r\n\r\nThe collection of the internal taxes having been completed in some of the\r\nStates, the officers employed in it are of course out of commission. In\r\nothers they will be so shortly. But in a few, where the arrangements for\r\nthe direct tax had been retarded, it will be some time before the system is\r\nclosed. It has not yet been thought necessary to employ the agent\r\nauthorized by an act of the last session for transacting business in Europe\r\nrelative to debts and loans. Nor have we used the power confided by the\r\nsame act of prolonging the foreign debt by reloans, and of redeeming\r\ninstead thereof an equal sum of the domestic debt. Should, however, the\r\ndifficulties of remittance on so large a scale render it necessary at any\r\ntime, the power shall be executed and the money thus employed abroad shall,\r\nin conformity with that law, be faithfully applied here in an equivalent\r\nextinction of domestic debt.\r\n\r\nWhen effects so salutary result from the plans you have already sanctioned;\r\nwhen merely by avoiding false objects of expense we are able, without a\r\ndirect tax, without internal taxes, and without borrowing to make large and\r\neffectual payments toward the discharge of our public debt and the\r\nemancipation of our posterity from that mortal canker, it is an\r\nencouragement, fellow citizens, of the highest order to proceed as we have\r\nbegun in substituting economy for taxation, and in pursuing what is useful\r\nfor a nation placed as we are, rather than what is practiced by others\r\nunder different circumstances. And when so ever we are destined to meet\r\nevents which shall call forth all the energies of our country-men, we have\r\nthe firmest reliance on those energies and the comfort of leaving for calls\r\nlike these the extraordinary resources of loans and internal taxes. In the\r\nmean time, by payments of the principal of our debt, we are liberating\r\nannually portions of the external taxes and forming from them a growing\r\nfund still further to lessen the necessity of recurring to extraordinary\r\nresources.\r\n\r\nThe usual account of receipts and expenditures for the last year, with an\r\nestimate of the expenses of the ensuing one, will be laid before you by the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury.\r\n\r\nNo change being deemed necessary in our military establishment, an estimate\r\nof its expenses for the ensuing year on its present footing, as also of the\r\nsums to be employed in fortifications and other objects within that\r\ndepartment, has been prepared by the Secretary of War, and will make a part\r\nof the general estimates which will be presented you.\r\n\r\nConsidering that our regular troops are employed for local purposes, and\r\nthat the militia is our general reliance for great and sudden emergencies,\r\nyou will doubtless think this institution worthy of a review, and give it\r\nthose improvements of which you find it susceptible.\r\n\r\nEstimates for the Naval Department, prepared by the Secretary of the Navy,\r\nfor another year will in like manner be communicated with the general\r\nestimates. A small force in the Mediterranean will still be necessary to\r\nrestrain the Tripoline cruisers, and the uncertain tenure of peace with\r\nsome other of the Barbary Powers may eventually require that force to be\r\naugmented. The necessity of procuring some smaller vessels for that service\r\nwill raise the estimate, but the difference in their maintenance will soon\r\nmake it a measure of economy.\r\n\r\nPresuming it will be deemed expedient to expend annually a convenient sum\r\ntoward providing the naval defense which our situation may require, I can\r\nnot but recommend that the first appropriations for that purpose may go to\r\nthe saving what we already possess. No cares, no attentions, can preserve\r\nvessels from rapid decay which lie in water and exposed to the sun. These\r\ndecays require great and constant repairs, and will consume, if continued,\r\na great portion of the moneys destined to naval purposes. To avoid this\r\nwaste of our resources it is proposed to add to our navy-yard here a dock\r\nwithin which our present vessels may be laid up dry and under cover from\r\nthe sun. Under these circumstances experience proves that works of wood\r\nwill remain scarcely at all affected by time. The great abundance of\r\nrunning water which this situation possesses, at heights far above the\r\nlevel of the tide, if employed as is practiced for lock navigation,\r\nfurnishes the means for raising and laying up our vessels on a dry and\r\nsheltered bed. And should the measure be found useful here, similar\r\ndepositories for laying up as well as for building and repairing vessels\r\nmay hereafter be undertaken at other navy-yards offering the same means.\r\nThe plans and estimates of the work, prepared by a person of skill and\r\nexperience, will be presented to you without delay, and from this it will\r\nbe seen that scarcely more than has been the cost of one vessel is necessary\r\nto save the whole, and that the annual sum to be employed toward its\r\ncompletion may be adapted to the views of the Legislature as to naval\r\nexpenditure. To cultivate peace and maintain commerce and navigation in all\r\ntheir lawful enterprises; to foster our fisheries as nurseries of\r\nnavigation and for the nurture of man, and protect the manufactures adapted\r\nto our circumstances; to preserve the faith of the nation by an exact\r\ndischarge of its debts and contracts, expend the public money with the same\r\ncare and economy we would practice with our own, and impose on our citizens\r\nno unnecessary burthens; to keep in all things within the pale of our\r\nconstitutional powers, and cherish the federal union as the only rock of\r\nsafety--these, fellow citizens, are the land-marks by which we are to\r\nguide ourselves in all proceedings. By continuing to make these the rule of\r\nour action we shall endear to our country-men the true principles of their\r\nConstitution and promote an union of sentiment and of action equally\r\nauspicious to their happiness and safety. On my part, you may count on a\r\ncordial concurrence in every measure for the public good and on all the\r\ninformation I possess which may enable you to discharge to advantage the\r\nhigh functions with which you are invested by your country.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nThomas Jefferson\r\nOctober 17, 1803\r\n\r\nTo The Senate and House of Representatives of the United States:\r\n\r\nIn calling you together, fellow citizens, at an earlier day than was\r\ncontemplated by the act of the last session of Congress, I have not been\r\ninsensible to the personal inconveniences necessarily resulting from an\r\nunexpected change in your arrangements, but matters of great public\r\nconcernment have rendered this call necessary, and the interests you feel\r\nin these will supersede in your minds all private considerations.\r\n\r\nCongress witnessed at their late session the extraordinary agitation\r\nproduced in the public mind by the suspension of our right of deposit at\r\nthe port of New Orleans, no assignment of another place having been made\r\naccording to treaty. They were sensible that the continuance of that\r\nprivation would be more injurious to our nation than any consequences which\r\ncould flow from any mode of redress, but reposing just confidence in the\r\ngood faith of the Government whose officer had committed the wrong,\r\nfriendly and reasonable representations were resorted to, and the right of\r\ndeposit was restored.\r\n\r\nPrevious, however, to this period we had not been unaware of the danger to\r\nwhich our peace would be perpetually exposed whilst so important a key to\r\nthe commerce of the Western country remained under foreign power.\r\nDifficulties, too, were presenting themselves as to the navigation of other\r\nstreams which, arising within our territories, pass through those adjacent.\r\nPropositions had therefore been authorized for obtaining on fair conditions\r\nthe sovereignty of New Orleans and of other possessions in that quarter\r\ninteresting to our quiet to such extent as was deemed practicable, and the\r\nprovisional appropriation of $2 millions to be applied and accounted\r\nfor by the President of the United States, intended as part of the price,\r\nwas considered as conveying the sanction of Congress to the acquisition\r\nproposed. The enlightened Government of France saw with just discernment\r\nthe importance to both nations of such liberal arrangements as might best\r\nand permanently promote the peace, friendship, and interests of both, and\r\nthe property and sovereignty of all Louisiana which had been restored to\r\nthem have on certain conditions been transferred to the United States by\r\ninstruments bearing date the 30th of April last. When these shall have\r\nreceived the constitutional sanction of the Senate, they will without delay\r\nbe communicated to the Representatives also for the exercise of their\r\nfunctions as to those conditions which are within the powers vested by the\r\nConstitution in Congress.\r\n\r\nWhilst the property and sovereignty of the Mississippi and its waters\r\nsecure an independent outlet for the produce of the Western States and an\r\nuncontrolled navigation through their whole course, free from collision\r\nwith other powers and the dangers to our peace from that source, the\r\nfertility of the country, its climate and extent, promise in due season\r\nimportant aids to our Treasury, an ample provision for our posterity, and a\r\nwide spread for the blessings of freedom and equal laws.\r\n\r\nWith the wisdom of Congress it will rest to take those ulterior measures\r\nwhich may be necessary for the immediate occupation and temporary\r\ngovernment of the country; for its incorporation into our Union; for\r\nrendering the change of government a blessing to our newly adopted\r\nbrethren; for securing to them the rights of conscience and of property;\r\nfor confirming to the Indian inhabitants their occupancy and\r\nself-government, establishing friendly and commercial relations with them,\r\nand for ascertaining the geography of the country acquired. Such materials,\r\nfor your information, relative to its affairs in general as the short space\r\nof time has permitted me to collect will be laid before you when the\r\nsubject shall be in a state for your consideration.\r\n\r\nAnother important acquisition of territory has also been made since the\r\nlast session of Congress. The friendly tribe of Kaskaskia Indians, with\r\nwhich we have never had a difference, reduced by the wars and wants of\r\nsavage life to a few individuals unable to defend themselves against the\r\nneighboring tribes, has transferred its country to the United States,\r\nreserving only for its members what is sufficient to maintain them in an\r\nagricultural way. The considerations stipulated are that we shall extend to\r\nthem our patronage and protection and give them certain annual aids in\r\nmoney, in implements of agriculture, and other articles of their choice.\r\nThis country, among the most fertile within our limits, extending along the\r\nMississippi from the mouth of the Illinois to and up to the Ohio, though\r\nnot so necessary as a barrier since the acquisition of the other bank, may\r\nyet be well worthy of being laid open to immediate settlement, as its\r\ninhabitants may descend with rapidity in support of the lower country\r\nshould future circumstances expose that to foreign enterprise. As the\r\nstipulations in this treaty involve matters with the competence of both\r\nHouses only, it will be laid before Congress as soon as the Senate shall\r\nhave advised its ratification.\r\n\r\nWith many of the other Indian tribes improvements in agriculture and\r\nhousehold manufacture are advancing, and with all our peace and friendship\r\nare established on grounds much firmer than heretofore. The measure adopted\r\nof establishing trading houses among them and of furnishing them\r\nnecessaries in exchange for their commodities at such moderate prices as\r\nleave no gain, but cover us from loss, has the most conciliatory and useful\r\neffect on them, and is that which will best secure their peace and good\r\nwill.\r\n\r\nThe small vessels authorized by Congress with a view to the Mediterranean\r\nservice have been sent into that sea, and will be able more effectually to\r\nconfine the Tripoline cruisers within their harbors and supersede the\r\nnecessity of convoy to our commerce in that quarter. They will sensibly\r\nlessen the expenses of that service the ensuing year.\r\n\r\nA further knowledge of the ground in the northeastern and northwestern\r\nangles of the United States has evinced that the boundaries established by\r\nthe treaty of Paris between the British territories and ours in those parts\r\nwere too imperfectly described to be susceptible of execution. It has\r\ntherefore been thought worthy of attention for preserving and cherishing\r\nthe harmony and useful intercourse subsisting between the two nations to\r\nremove by timely arrangements what unfavorable incidents might otherwise\r\nrender a ground of future misunderstanding. A convention has therefore been\r\nentered into which provides for a practicable demarcation of those limits\r\nto the satisfaction of both parties.\r\n\r\nAn account of the receipts and expenditures of the year ending the 30th of\r\nSeptember last, with the estimates for the service of the ensuing year,\r\nwill be laid before you by the Secretary of the Treasury so soon as the\r\nreceipts of the last quarter shall be returned from the more distant\r\nStates. It is already ascertained that the amount paid into the Treasury\r\nfor that year has been between $11 millions and $12 millions, and that the\r\nrevenue accrued during the same term exceeds the sum counted on as\r\nsufficient for our current expenses and to extinguish the public debt\r\nwithin the period heretofore proposed.\r\n\r\nThe amount of debt paid for the same year is about $3.1 millions exclusive\r\nof interest, and making, with the payment of the preceding year, a\r\ndischarge of more than $8.5 millions of the principal of that debt,\r\nbesides the accruing interest; and there remain in the Treasury nearly\r\n$6 millions. Of these, $880 thousands have been reserved for payment of\r\nthe first installment due under the British convention of January 8th,\r\n1802, and $2 millions are what have been before mentioned as placed by\r\nCongress under the power and accountability of the President toward the\r\nprice of New Orleans and other territories acquired, which, remaining\r\nuntouched, are still applicable to that object and go in diminution of\r\nthe sum to be funded for it.\r\n\r\nShould the acquisition of Louisiana be constitutionally confirmed and\r\ncarried into effect, a sum of nearly $13 millions will then be added to\r\nour public debt, most of which is payable after fifteen years, before\r\nwhich term the present existing debts will all be discharged by the\r\nestablished operation of the sinking fund. When we contemplate the\r\nordinary annual augmentation of impost from increasing population and\r\nwealth, the augmentation of the same revenue by its extension to the new\r\nacquisition, and the economies which may still be introduced into our\r\npublic expenditures, I can not but hope that Congress in reviewing\r\ntheir resources will find means to meet the intermediate interest of\r\nthis additional debt without recurring to new taxes, and applying to this\r\nobject only the ordinary progression of our revenue. Its extraordinary\r\nincrease in times of foreign war will be the proper and sufficient fund\r\nfor any measures of safety or precaution which that state of things may\r\nrender necessary in our neutral position.\r\n\r\nRemittances for the installments of our foreign debt having been found\r\npracticable without loss, it has not been thought expedient to use the\r\npower given by a former act of Congress of continuing them by reloans, and\r\nof redeeming instead thereof equal sums of domestic debt, although no\r\ndifficulty was found in obtaining that accommodation.\r\n\r\nThe sum of $50 thousands appropriated by Congress for providing gun boats\r\nremains unexpended. The favorable and peaceable turn of affairs on the\r\nMississippi rendered an immediate execution of that law unnecessary, and\r\ntime was desirable in order that the institution of that branch of our\r\nforce might begin on models the most approved by experience. The same\r\nissue of events dispensed with a resort to the appropriation of $1.5\r\nmillions, contemplated for purposes which were effected by happier means.\r\n\r\nWe have seen with sincere concern the flames of war lighted up again in\r\nEurope, and nations with which we have the most friendly and useful\r\nrelations engaged in mutual destruction. While we regret the miseries in\r\nwhich we see others involved, let us bow with gratitude to that kind\r\nProvidence which, inspiring with wisdom and moderation our late legislative\r\ncouncils while placed under the urgency of the greatest wrongs guarded us\r\nfrom hastily entering into the sanguinary contest and left us only to look\r\non and pity its ravages.\r\n\r\nThese will be heaviest on those immediately engaged. Yet the nations\r\npursuing peace will not be exempt from all evil.\r\n\r\nIn the course of this conflict let it be our endeavor, as it is our\r\ninterest and desire, to cultivate the friendship of the belligerent nations\r\nby every act of justice and of innocent kindness; to receive their armed\r\nvessels with hospitality from the distresses of the sea, but to administer\r\nthe means of annoyance to none; to establish in our harbors such a police\r\nas may maintain law and order; to restrain our citizens from embarking\r\nindividually in a war in which their country takes no part; to punish\r\nseverely those persons, citizens or alien, who shall usurp the cover of our\r\nflag for vessels not entitled to it, infecting thereby with suspicion those\r\nof real Americans and committing us into controversies for the redress of\r\nwrongs not our own; to exact from every nation the observance toward our\r\nvessels and citizens of those principles and practices which all civilized\r\npeople acknowledge; to merit the character of a just nation, and maintain\r\nthat of an independent one, preferring every consequence to insult and\r\nhabitual wrong. Congress will consider whether the existing laws enable us\r\nefficaciously to maintain this course with our citizens in all places and\r\nwith others while within the limits of our jurisdiction, and will give them\r\nthe new modifications necessary for these objects. Some contraventions of\r\nright have already taken place, both within our jurisdictional limits and\r\non the high seas. The friendly disposition of the Governments from whose\r\nagents they have proceeded, as well as their wisdom and regard for justice,\r\nleave us in reasonable expectation that they will be rectified and\r\nprevented in future, and that no act will be countenanced by them which\r\nthreatens to disturb our friendly intercourse.\r\n\r\nSeparated by a wide ocean from the nations of Europe and from the political\r\ninterests which entangle them together, with productions and wants which\r\nrender our commerce and friendship useful to them and theirs to us, it can\r\nnot be the interest of any to assail us, nor ours to disturb them. We\r\nshould be most unwise, indeed, were we to cast away the singular blessings\r\nof the position in which nature has placed us, the opportunity she has\r\nendowed us with of pursuing, at a distance from foreign contentions, the\r\npaths of industry, peace, and happiness, of cultivating general friendship,\r\nand of bringing collisions of interest to the umpirage of reason rather\r\nthan of force.\r\n\r\nHow desirable, then, must it be in a Government like ours to see its\r\ncitizens adopt individually the views, the interests, and the conduct which\r\ntheir country should pursue, divesting themselves of those passions and\r\npartialities which tend to lessen useful friendships and to embarrass and\r\nembroil us in the calamitous scenes of Europe. Confident, fellow citizens,\r\nthat you will duly estimate the importance of neutral dispositions toward\r\nthe observance of neutral conduct, that you will be sensible how much it is\r\nour duty to look on the bloody arena spread before us with commiseration\r\nindeed, but with no other wish than to see it closed, I am persuaded you\r\nwill cordially cherish these dispositions in all discussions among\r\nyourselves and in all communications with your constituents; and I\r\nanticipate with satisfaction the measures of wisdom which the great\r\ninterests now committed to you will give you an opportunity of providing,\r\nand myself that of approving and carrying into execution with the fidelity\r\nI owe to my country.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nThomas Jefferson\r\nNovember 8, 1804\r\n\r\nThe Senate and House of Representatives of the United States:\r\n\r\nTo a people, fellow citizens, who sincerely desire the happiness and\r\nprosperity of other nations; to those who justly calculate that their own\r\nwell-being is advanced by that of the nations with which they have\r\nintercourse, it will be a satisfaction to observe that the war which was\r\nlighted up in Europe a little before our last meeting has not yet extended\r\nits flames to other nations, nor been marked by the calamities which\r\nsometimes stain the foot-steps of war. The irregularities, too, on the\r\nocean, which generally harass the commerce of neutral nations, have, in\r\ndistant parts, disturbed ours less than on former occasions; but in the\r\nAmerican seas they have been greater from peculiar causes, and even within\r\nour harbors and jurisdiction infringements on the authority of the laws\r\nhave been committed which have called for serious attention. The friendly\r\nconduct of the Governments from whose officers and subjects these acts have\r\nproceeded, in other respects and in places more under their observation and\r\ncontrol, gives us confidence that our representations on this subject will\r\nhave been properly regarded.\r\n\r\nWhile noticing the irregularities committed on the ocean by others, those\r\non our own part should not be omitted nor left unprovided for. Complaints\r\nhave been received that persons residing within the United States have\r\ntaken on themselves to arm merchant vessels and to force a commerce into\r\ncertain ports and countries in defiance of the laws of those countries.\r\nThat individuals should undertake to wage private war, independently of the\r\nauthority of their country, can not be permitted in a well-ordered society.\r\nIts tendency to produce aggression on the laws and rights of other nations\r\nand to endanger the peace of our own is so obvious that I doubt not you\r\nwill adopt measures for restraining it effectually in future.\r\n\r\nSoon after the passage of the act of the last session authorizing the\r\nestablishment of a district and port of entry on the waters of the Mobile\r\nwe learnt that its object was misunderstood on the part of Spain. Candid\r\nexplanations were immediately given and assurances that, reserving our\r\nclaims in that quarter as a subject of discussion and arrangement with\r\nSpain, no act was meditated in the mean time inconsistent with the peace\r\nand friendship existing between the two nations, and that conformably to\r\nthese intentions would be the execution of the law. That Government had,\r\nhowever, thought proper to suspend the ratification of the convention of\r\n1802; but the explanations which would reach them soon after, and still\r\nmore the confirmation of them by the tenor of the instrument establishing\r\nthe port and district, may reasonably be expected to replace them in the\r\ndispositions and views of the whole subject which originally dictated the\r\nconvention.\r\n\r\nI have the satisfaction to inform you that the objections which had been\r\nurged by that Government against the validity of our title to the country\r\nof Louisiana have been withdrawn, its exact limits, however, remaining\r\nstill to be settled between us; and to this is to be added that, having\r\nprepared and delivered the stock created in execution of the convention of\r\nParis of April 30th, 1803, in consideration of the cession of that\r\ncountry, we have received from the Government of France an acknowledgment,\r\nin due form, of the fulfillment of that stipulation.\r\n\r\nWith the nations of Europe in general our friendship and intercourse are\r\nundisturbed, and from the Governments of the belligerent powers especially\r\nwe continue to receive those friendly manifestations which are justly due\r\nto an honest neutrality and to such good offices consistent with that as we\r\nhave opportunities of rendering.\r\n\r\nThe activity and success of the small force employed in the Mediterranean\r\nin the early part of the present year, the reenforcements sent into that\r\nsea, and the energy of the officers having command in the several vessels\r\nwill, I trust, by the sufferings of war, reduce the barbarians of Tripoli\r\nto the desire of peace on proper terms. Great injury, however, ensues to\r\nourselves, as well as to others interested, from the distance to which\r\nprizes must be brought for adjudication and from the impracticability of\r\nbringing hither such as are not sea worthy.\r\n\r\nThe Bey of Tunis having made requisitions unauthorized by our treaty, their\r\nrejection has produced from him some expressions of discontent, but to\r\nthose who expect us to calculate whether a compliance with unjust demands\r\nwill not cost us less than a war we must leave as a question of calculation\r\nfor them also whether to retire from unjust demands will not cost them less\r\nthan a war. We can do to each other very sensible injuries by war, but the\r\nmutual advantages of peace make that the best interest of both.\r\n\r\nPeace and intercourse with the other powers on the same coast continue on\r\nthe footing on which they are established by treaty.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the act providing for the temporary government of\r\nLouisiana, the necessary officers for the Territory of Orleans were\r\nappointed in due time to commence the exercise of their functions on the\r\nfirst day of October. The distance, however, of some of them and\r\nindispensable previous arrangements may have retarded its commencement in\r\nsome of its parts. The form of government thus provided having been\r\nconsidered but as temporary, and open to such future improvements as\r\nfurther information of the circumstances of our brethren there might\r\nsuggest, it will of course be subject to your consideration.\r\n\r\nIn the district of Louisiana it has been thought best to adopt the division\r\ninto subordinate districts which had been established under its former\r\ngovernment. These being five in number, a commanding officer has been\r\nappointed to each, according to the provisions of the law, and so soon as\r\nthey can be at their stations that district will also be in its due state\r\nof organization. In the mean time, their places are supplied by the\r\nofficers before commanding there, and the function of the governor and\r\njudges of Indiana having commenced, the government, we presume, is\r\nproceeding in its new form. The lead mines in that district offer so rich a\r\nsupply of that metal as to merit attention. The report now communicated\r\nwill inform you of their state and of the necessity of immediate inquiry\r\ninto their occupation and titles.\r\n\r\nWith the Indian tribes established within our newly acquired limits, I have\r\ndeemed it necessary to open conferences for the purpose of establishing a\r\ngood understanding and neighborly relations between us. So far as we have\r\nyet learned, we have reason to believe that their dispositions are\r\ngenerally favorable and friendly; and with these dispositions on their\r\npart, we have in our own hands means which can not fail us for preserving\r\ntheir peace and friendship. By pursuing an uniform course of justice toward\r\nthem, by aiding them in all the improvements which may better their\r\ncondition, and especially by establishing a commerce on terms which shall\r\nbe advantageous to them and only not losing to us, and so regulated as that\r\nno incendiaries of our own or any other nation may be permitted to disturb\r\nthe natural effects of our just and friendly offices, we may render\r\nourselves so necessary to their comfort and prosperity that the protection\r\nof our citizens from their disorderly members will become their interest\r\nand their voluntary care. Instead, therefore, of an augmentation of\r\nmilitary force proportioned to our extension of frontier, I propose a\r\nmoderate enlargement of the capital employed in that commerce as a more\r\neffectual, economical, and humane instrument for preserving peace and good\r\nneighborhood with them.\r\n\r\nOn this side of the Mississippi an important relinquishment of native title\r\nhas been received from the Delawares. That tribe, desiring to extinguish in\r\ntheir people the spirit of hunting and to convert superfluous lands into\r\nthe means of improving what they retain, has ceded to us all the country\r\nbetween the Wabash and Ohio south of and including the road from the rapids\r\ntoward Vincennes, for which they are to receive annuities in animals and\r\nimplements for agriculture and in other necessaries. This acquisition is\r\nimportant, not only for its extent and fertility, but as fronting three\r\nhundred miles on the Ohio, and near half that on the Wabash. The produce\r\nof the settled country descending those rivers will no longer pass in\r\nreview of the Indian frontier but in a small portion, and, with the\r\ncession heretofore made by the Kaskaskias, nearly consolidates our\r\npossessions north of the Ohio, in a very respectable breadth--from Lake\r\nErie to the Mississippi. The Piankeshaws having some claim to the country\r\nceded by the Delawares, it has been thought best to quiet that by fair\r\npurchase also. So soon as the treaties on this subject shall have received\r\ntheir constitutional sanctions they shall be laid before both houses.\r\n\r\nThe act of Congress of February 28th, 1803, for building and employing a\r\nnumber of gun boats, is now in a course of execution to the extent there\r\nprovided for. The obstacle to naval enterprise which vessels of this\r\nconstruction offer for our sea port towns, their utility toward supporting\r\nwithin our waters the authority of the laws, the promptness with which they\r\nwill be manned by the sea men and militia of the place in the moment they\r\nare wanting, the facility of their assembling from different parts of the\r\ncoast to any point where they are required in greater force than ordinary,\r\nthe economy of their maintenance and preservation from decay when not in\r\nactual service, and the competence of our finances to this defensive\r\nprovision without any new burthen are considerations which will have due\r\nweight with Congress in deciding on the expediency of adding to their\r\nnumber from year to year, as experience shall test their utility, until all\r\nour important harbors, by these and auxiliary means, shall be secured\r\nagainst insult and opposition to the laws.\r\n\r\nNo circumstance has arisen since your last session which calls for any\r\naugmentation of our regular military force. Should any improvement occur in\r\nthe militia system, that will be always seasonable.\r\n\r\nAccounts of the receipts and expenditures of the last year, with estimates\r\nfor the ensuing one, will as usual be laid before you.\r\n\r\nThe state of our finances continues to fulfill our expectations. $11.5\r\nmillions, received in the course of the year ending the 30th of September\r\nlast, have enabled us, after meeting all the ordinary expenses of the\r\nyear, to pay upward of $3.6 millions of the public debt, exclusive of\r\ninterest. This payment, with those of the two preceding years, has\r\nextinguished upward of $12 millions of the principal and a greater sum\r\nof interest within that period, and by a proportionate diminution of\r\ninterest renders already sensible the effect of the growing sum yearly\r\napplicable to the discharge of the principal.\r\n\r\nIt is also ascertained that the revenue accrued during the last year\r\nexceeds that of the preceding, and the probable receipts of the ensuing\r\nyear may safely be relied on as sufficient, with the sum already in the\r\nTreasury, to meet all the current demands of the year, to discharge upward\r\nof $3.5 millions of the engagements incurred under the British and French\r\nconventions, and to advance in the further redemption of the funded debt as\r\nrapidly as had been contemplated.\r\n\r\nThese, fellow citizens, are the principal matters which I have thought it\r\nnecessary at this time to communicate for your consideration and attention.\r\nSome others will be laid before you in the course of the session; but in\r\nthe discharge of the great duties confided to you by our country you will\r\ntake a broader view of the field of legislation.\r\n\r\nWhether the great interests of agriculture, manufactures, commerce, or\r\nnavigation can within the pale of your constitutional powers be aided in\r\nany of their relations; whether laws are provided in all cases where they\r\nare wanting; whether those provided are exactly what they should be; whether\r\nany abuses take place in their administration, or in that of the public\r\nrevenues; whether the organization of the public agents or of the public\r\nforce is perfect in all its parts; in fine, whether anything can be done to\r\nadvance the general good, are questions within the limits of your functions\r\nwhich will necessarily occupy your attention. In these and all other\r\nmatters which you in your wisdom may propose for the good of our country,\r\nyou may count with assurance on my hearty cooperation and faithful\r\nexecution.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nThomas Jefferson\r\nDecember 3, 1805\r\n\r\nThe Senate and House of Representatives of the United States:\r\n\r\nAt a moment when the nations of Europe are in commotion and arming against\r\neach other, and when those with whom we have principal intercourse are\r\nengaged in the general contest, and when the countenance of some of them\r\ntoward our peaceable country threatens that even that may not be unaffected\r\nby what is passing on the general theater, a meeting of the representatives\r\nof the nation in both Houses of Congress has become more than usually\r\ndesirable. Coming from every section of our country, they bring with them\r\nthe sentiments and the information of the whole, and will be enabled to\r\ngive a direction to the public affairs which the will and the wisdom of the\r\nwhole will approve and support.\r\n\r\nIn taking a view of the state of our country we in the first place notice\r\nthe late affliction of two of our cities under the fatal fever which in\r\nlatter times has occasionally visited our shores. Providence in His\r\ngoodness gave it an early termination on this occasion and lessened the\r\nnumber of victims which have usually fallen before it. In the course of the\r\nseveral visitations by this disease it has appeared that it is strictly\r\nlocal, incident to cities and on the tide waters only, incommunicable in\r\nthe country either by persons under the disease or by goods carried from\r\ndiseased places; that its access is with the autumn and it disappears with\r\nthe early frosts.\r\n\r\nThese restrictions within narrow limits of time and space give security\r\neven to our maritime cities during three quarter of the year, and to the\r\ncountry always. Although from these facts it appears unnecessary, yet to\r\nsatisfy the fears of foreign nations and cautions on their part not to be\r\ncomplained of in a danger whose limits are yet unknown to them I have\r\nstrictly enjoined on the officers at the head of the customs to certify\r\nwith exact truth for every vessel sailing for a foreign port the state of\r\nhealth respecting this fever which prevails at the place from which she\r\nsails. Under every motive from character and duty to certify the truth, I\r\nhave no doubt they have faithfully executed this injunction. Much real\r\ninjury has, however, been sustained from a propensity to identify with this\r\nendemic and to call by the same name fevers of very different kinds, which\r\nhave been known at all times and in all countries, and never have been\r\nplaced among those deemed contagious.\r\n\r\nAs we advance in our knowledge of this disease, as facts develop the source\r\nfrom which individuals receive it, the State authorities charged with the\r\ncare of the public health, and Congress with that of the general commerce,\r\nwill become able to regulate with effect their respective functions in\r\nthese departments. The burthen of quarantines is felt at home as well as\r\nabroad; their efficacy merits examination. Although the health laws of the\r\nStates should be found to need no present revisal by Congress, yet commerce\r\nclaims that their attention be ever awake to them.\r\n\r\nSince our last meeting the aspect of our foreign relations has considerably\r\nchanged. Our coasts have been infested and our harbors watched by private\r\narmed vessels, some of them without commissions, some with illegal\r\ncommissions, others with those of legal form, but committing practical acts\r\nbeyond the authority of their commissions. They have captured in the very\r\nentrance of our harbors, as well as on the high seas, not only the vessels\r\nof our friends coming to trade with us, but our own also. They have carried\r\nthem off under pretense of legal adjudication, but not daring to approach a\r\ncourt of justice, they have plundered and sunk them by the way or in\r\nobscure places where no evidence could arise against them, maltreated the\r\ncrews, and abandoned them in boats in the open sea or on desert shores\r\nwithout food or clothing. These enormities appearing to be unreached by any\r\ncontrol of their sovereigns, I found it necessary to equip a force to\r\ncruise within our own seas, to arrest all vessels of these descriptions\r\nfound hovering on our coasts within the limits of the Gulf Stream and to\r\nbring the offenders in for trial as pirates.\r\n\r\nThe same system of hovering on our coasts and harbors under color of\r\nseeking enemies has been also carried on by public armed ships to the great\r\nannoyance and oppression of our commerce. New principles, too, have been\r\ninterpolated into the law of nations, founded neither in justice nor in the\r\nusage or acknowledgment of nations. According to these a belligerent takes\r\nto itself a commerce with its own enemy which it denies to a neutral on the\r\nground of its aiding that enemy in the war; but reason revolts at such\r\ninconsistency, and the neutral having equal right with the belligerent to\r\ndecide the question, the interests of our constituents and the duty of\r\nmaintaining the authority of reason, the only umpire between just nations,\r\nimpose on us the obligation of providing an effectual and determined\r\nopposition to a doctrine so injurious to the rights of peaceable nations.\r\nIndeed, the confidence we ought to have in the justice of others still\r\ncountenances the hope that a sounder view of those rights will of itself\r\ninduce from every belligerent a more correct observance of them.\r\n\r\nWith Spain our negotiations for a settlement of differences have not had a\r\nsatisfactory issue. Spoliations during a former war, for which she had\r\nacknowledged herself responsible, have been refused to be compensated but\r\non conditions affecting other claims in no wise connected with them. Yet\r\nthe same practices are renewed in the present war and are already of great\r\namount. On the Mobile, our commerce passing through that river continues to\r\nbe obstructed by arbitrary duties and vexatious searches. Propositions for\r\nadjusting amicably the boundaries of Louisiana have not been acceded to.\r\nWhile, however, the right is unsettled, we have avoided changing the state\r\nof things by taking new posts or strengthening ourselves in the disputed\r\nterritories, in the hope that the other power would not by a contrary\r\nconduct oblige us to meet their example and endanger conflicts of authority,\r\nthe issue of which may not be easily controlled. But in this hope we\r\nhave now reason to lessen our confidence.\r\n\r\nInroads have been recently made into the Territories of Orleans and the\r\nMississippi, our citizens have been seized and their property plundered in\r\nthe very parts of the former which had been actually delivered up by Spain,\r\nand this by the regular officers and soldiers of that Government. I have\r\ntherefore found it necessary at length to give orders to our troops on that\r\nfrontier to be in readiness to protect our citizens, and to repel by arms\r\nany similar aggressions in future. Other details necessary for your full\r\ninformation of the state of things between this country and that shall be\r\nthe subject of another communication.\r\n\r\nIn reviewing these injuries from some of the belligerent powers the\r\nmoderation, the firmness, and the wisdom of the Legislature will be called\r\ninto action. We ought still to hope that time and a more correct estimate\r\nof interest as well as of character will produce the justice we are bound\r\nto expect, but should any nation deceive itself by false calculations, and\r\ndisappoint that expectation, we must join in the unprofitable contest of\r\ntrying which party can do the other the most harm.\r\n\r\nSome of these injuries may perhaps admit a peaceable remedy. Where that is\r\ncompetent it is always the most desirable. But some of them are of a nature\r\nto be met by force only, and all of them may lead to it. I can not,\r\ntherefore, but recommend such preparations as circumstances call for.\r\n\r\nThe first object is to place our sea port towns out of the danger of\r\ninsult. Measures have been already taken for furnishing them with heavy\r\ncannon for the service of such land batteries as may make a part of their\r\ndefense against armed vessels approaching them. In aid of these it is\r\ndesirable we should have a competent number of gun boats, and the number,\r\nto be competent, must be considerable. If immediately begun, they may be in\r\nreadiness for service at the opening of the next season.\r\n\r\nWhether it will be necessary to augment our land forces will be decided by\r\noccurrences probably in the course of your session. In the mean time you\r\nwill consider whether it would not be expedient for a state of peace as\r\nwell as of war so to organize or class the militia as would enable us on\r\nany sudden emergency to call for the services of the younger portions,\r\nunencumbered with the old and those having families. Upward of three\r\nhundred thousand able-bodied men between the ages of 18 and 26 years,\r\nwhich the last census shews we may now count within our limits, will\r\nfurnish a competent number for offense or defense in any point where they\r\nmay be wanted, and will give time for raising regular forces after the\r\nnecessity of them shall become certain; and the reducing to the early\r\nperiod of life all its active service can not but be desirable to our\r\nyounger citizens of the present as well as future times, in as much as it\r\nengages to them in more advanced age a quiet and undisturbed repose in\r\nthe bosom of their families. I can not, then, but earnestly recommend to\r\nyour early consideration the expediency of so modifying our militia\r\nsystem as, by a separation of the more active part from that which is\r\nless so, we may draw from it when necessary an efficient corps fit for\r\nreal and active service, and to be called to it in regular rotation.\r\n\r\nConsiderable provision has been made under former authorities from Congress\r\nof material for the construction of ships of war of 74 guns. These\r\nmaterials are on hand subject to the further will of the Legislature.\r\n\r\nAn immediate prohibition of the exportation of arms and ammunition is also\r\nsubmitted to your determination.\r\n\r\nTurning from these unpleasant views of violence and wrong, I congratulate\r\nyou on the liberation of our fellow citizens who were stranded on the coast\r\nof Tripoli and made prisoners of war. In a government bottomed on the will\r\nof all the life and liberty of every individual citizen become interesting\r\nto all.\r\n\r\nIn the treaty, therefore, which has concluded our warfare with that State\r\nan article for the ransom of our citizens has been agreed to. An operation\r\nby land by a small band of our country-men and others, engaged for the\r\noccasion in conjunction with the troops of the ex-Bashaw of that country,\r\ngallantly conducted by our late consul, Eaton, and their successful\r\nenterprise on the city of Derne, contributed doubtless to the impression\r\nwhich produced peace, and the conclusion of this prevented opportunities of\r\nwhich the officers and men of our squadron destined for Tripoli would have\r\navailed themselves to emulate the acts of valor exhibited by their brethren\r\nin the attack of the last year. Reflecting with high satisfaction on the\r\ndistinguished bravery displayed whenever occasions permitted it in the late\r\nMediterranean service, I think it would be an useful encouragement as well\r\nas a just reward to make an opening for some present promotion by enlarging\r\nour peace establishment of captains and lieutenants.\r\n\r\nWith Tunis some misunderstandings have arisen not yet sufficiently\r\nexplained, but friendly discussions with their ambassador recently arrived\r\nand a mutual disposition to do whatever is just and reasonable can not fail\r\nof dissipating these, so that we may consider our peace on that coast,\r\ngenerally, to be on as sound a footing as it has been at any preceding\r\ntime. Still, it will not be expedient to withdraw immediately the whole of\r\nour force from that sea.\r\n\r\nThe law providing for a naval peace establishment fixes the number of\r\nfrigates which shall be kept in constant service in time of peace, and\r\nprescribes that they shall be manned by not more than two-thirds of their\r\ncomplement of sea men and ordinary sea men. Whether a frigate may be\r\ntrusted to two-thirds only of her proper complement of men must depend on\r\nthe nature of the service on which she is ordered; that may sometimes, for\r\nher safety as well as to insure her object, require her fullest complement.\r\nIn adverting to this subject Congress will perhaps consider whether the\r\nbest limitation on the Executive discretion in this case would not be by\r\nthe number of sea men which may be employed in the whole service rather\r\nthan by the number of vessels. Occasions oftener arise for the employment\r\nof small than of large vessels, and it would lessen risk as well as\r\nexpense to be authorized to employ them of preference. The limitation\r\nsuggested by the number of sea men would admit a selection of vessels\r\nbest adapted to the service.\r\n\r\nOur Indian neighbors are advancing, many of them with spirit, and others\r\nbeginning to engage in the pursuits of agriculture and household\r\nmanufacture. They are becoming sensible that the earth yields subsistence\r\nwith less labor and more certainty than the forest, and find it their\r\ninterest from time to time to dispose of parts of their surplus and waste\r\nlands for the means of improving those they occupy and of subsisting their\r\nfamilies while they are preparing their farms. Since your last session the\r\nNorthern tribes have sold to us the lands between the Connecticut Reserve\r\nand the former Indian boundary and those on the Ohio from the same boundary\r\nto the rapids and for a considerable depth inland. The Chickasaws and\r\nCherokees have sold us the country between and adjacent to the two\r\ndistricts of Tennessee, and the Creeks the residue of their lands in the\r\nfork of the Ocmulgee up to the Ulcofauhatche. The three former purchases\r\nare important, in as much as they consolidate disjoined parts of our\r\nsettled country and render their intercourse secure; and the second\r\nparticularly so, as, with the small point on the river which we expect is\r\nby this time ceded by the Piankeshaws, it completes our possession of the\r\nwhole of both banks of the Ohio from its source to near its mouth, and the\r\nnavigation of that river is thereby rendered forever safe to our citizens\r\nsettled and settling on its extensive waters. The purchase from the Creeks,\r\ntoo, has been for some time particularly interesting to the State of\r\nGeorgia.\r\n\r\nThe several treaties which have been mentioned will be submitted to both\r\nHouses of Congress for the exercise of their respective functions.\r\n\r\nDeputations now on their way to the seat of Government from various nations\r\nof Indians inhabiting the Missouri and other parts beyond the Mississippi\r\ncome charged with assurances of their satisfaction with the new relations\r\nin which they are placed with us, of their dispositions to cultivate our\r\npeace and friendship, and their desire to enter into commercial intercourse\r\nwith us. A state of our progress in exploring the principal rivers of that\r\ncountry, and of the information respecting them hitherto obtained, will be\r\ncommunicated as soon as we shall receive some further relations which we\r\nhave reason shortly to expect.\r\n\r\nThe receipts of the Treasury during the year ending on the 30th day of\r\nSeptember last have exceeded the sum of $13 millions, which, with not\r\nquite $5 millions in the Treasury at the beginning of the year, have\r\nenabled us after meeting other demands to pay nearly $2 millions of the\r\ndebt contracted under the British treaty and convention, upward of $4\r\nmillions of principal of the public debt, and $4 millions of interest.\r\nThese payments, with those which had been made in three years and a half\r\npreceding, have extinguished of the funded debt nearly $18 millions of\r\nprincipal. Congress by their act of November 10th, 1803, authorized us to\r\nborrow $1.75 millions toward meeting the claims of our citizens assumed by\r\nthe convention with France. We have not, however, made use of this\r\nauthority, because the sum of $4.5 millions, which remained in the\r\nTreasury on the same 30th day of September last, with the receipts of\r\nwhich we may calculate on for the ensuing year, besides paying the annual\r\nsum of $8 millions appropriated to the funded debt and meeting all the\r\ncurrent demands which may be expected, will enable us to pay the whole\r\nsum of $3.75 millions assumed by the French convention and still leave\r\nus a surplus of nearly $1 million at our free disposal. Should you\r\nconcur in the provisions of arms and armed vessels recommended by the\r\ncircumstances of the times, this surplus will furnish the means of doing\r\nso.\r\n\r\nOn this first occasion of addressing Congress since, by the choice of my\r\nconstituents, I have entered on a second term of administration, I embrace\r\nthe opportunity to give this public assurance that I will exert my best\r\nendeavors to administer faithfully the executive department, and will\r\nzealously cooperate with you in every measure which may tend to secure the\r\nliberty, property, and personal safety of our fellow citizens, and to\r\nconsolidate the republican forms and principles of our Government.\r\n\r\nIn the course of your session you shall receive all the aid which I can\r\ngive for the dispatch of public business, and all the information necessary\r\nfor your deliberations, of which the interests of our own country and the\r\nconfidence reposed in us by others will admit a communication.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nThomas Jefferson\r\nDecember 2, 1806\r\n\r\nThe Senate and House of Representatives of the United States:\r\n\r\nIt would have given me, fellow citizens, great satisfaction to announce in\r\nthe moment of your meeting that the difficulties in our foreign relations\r\nexisting at the time of your last separation had been amicably and justly\r\nterminated. I lost no time in taking those measures which were most likely\r\nto bring them to such a termination--by special missions charged with such\r\npowers and instructions as in the event of failure could leave no\r\nimputation on either our moderation or forbearance. The delays which have\r\nsince taken place in our negotiations with the British Government appear to\r\nhave proceeded from causes which do not forbid the expectation that during\r\nthe course of the session I may be enabled to lay before you their final\r\nissue. What will be that of the negotiations for settling our differences\r\nwith Spain nothing which had taken place at the date of the last dispatches\r\nenables us to pronounce. On the western side of the Mississippi she\r\nadvanced in considerable force, and took post at the settlement of Bayou\r\nPierre, on the Red River. This village was originally settled by France,\r\nwas held by her as long as she held Louisiana, and was delivered to Spain\r\nonly as a part of Louisiana. Being small, insulated, and distant, it was\r\nnot observed at the moment of redelivery to France and the United States\r\nthat she continued a guard of half a dozen men which had been stationed\r\nthere. A proposition, however, having been lately made by our commander in\r\nchief to assume the Sabine River as a temporary line of separation between\r\nthe troops of the two nations until the issue of our negotiations shall be\r\nknown, this has been referred by the Spanish commandant to his superior,\r\nand in the mean time he has withdrawn his force to the western side of the\r\nSabine River. The correspondence on this subject now communicated will\r\nexhibit more particularly the present state of things in that quarter.\r\n\r\nThe nature of that country requires indispensably that an unusual\r\nproportion of the force employed there should be cavalry or mounted\r\ninfantry. In order, therefore, that the commanding officer might be enabled\r\nto act with effect, I had authorized him to call on the governors of\r\nOrleans and Mississippi for a corps of five hundred volunteer cavalry.\r\nThe temporary arrangement he has proposed may perhaps render this\r\nunnecessary; but I inform you with great pleasure of the promptitude with\r\nwhich the inhabitants of those Territories have tendered their services in\r\ndefense of their country. It has done honor to themselves, entitled them\r\nto the confidence of their fellow citizens in every part of the Union,\r\nand must strengthen the general determination to protect them\r\nefficaciously under all circumstances which may occur.\r\n\r\nHaving received information that in another part of the United States a\r\ngreat number of private individuals were combining together, arming and\r\norganizing themselves contrary to law, to carry on a military expedition\r\nagainst the territories of Spain, I thought it necessary, by proclamation\r\nas well as by special orders, to take measures for preventing and\r\nsuppressing this enterprise, for seizing the vessels, arms, and other means\r\nprovided for it, and for arresting and bringing to justice its authors and\r\nabettors. It was due to that good faith which ought ever to be the rule of\r\naction in public as well as in private transactions, it was due to good\r\norder and regular government, that while the public force was acting\r\nstrictly on defensive and merely to protect our citizens from aggression\r\nthe criminal attempts of private individuals to decide for their country\r\nthe question of peace or war by commencing active and unauthorized\r\nhostilities should be promptly and efficaciously suppressed.\r\n\r\nWhether it will be necessary to enlarge our regular forces will depend on\r\nthe result of our negotiations with Spain; but as it is uncertain when that\r\nresult will be known, the provisional measures requisite for that, and to\r\nmeet any pressure intervening in that quarter, will be a subject for your\r\nearly consideration.\r\n\r\nThe possession of both banks of the Mississippi reducing to a single point\r\nthe defense of that river, its waters, and the country adjacent, it becomes\r\nhighly necessary to provide for that point a more adequate security. Some\r\nposition above its mouth, commanding the passage of the river, should be\r\nrendered sufficiently strong to cover the armed vessels which may be\r\nstationed there for defense, and in conjunction with them to present an\r\ninsuperable obstacle to any force attempting to pass. The approaches to the\r\ncity of New Orleans from the eastern quarter also will require to be\r\nexamined and more effectually guarded. For the internal support of the\r\ncountry the encouragement of a strong settlement on the western side of the\r\nMississippi, within reach of New Orleans, will be worthy the consideration\r\nof the Legislature.\r\n\r\nThe gun boats authorized by an act of the last session are so advanced that\r\nthey will be ready for service in the ensuing spring. Circumstances\r\npermitted us to allow the time necessary for their more solid construction.\r\nAs a much larger number will still be wanting to place our sea port towns\r\nand waters in that state of defense to which we are competent and they\r\nentitled, a similar appropriation for a further provision for them is\r\nrecommended for the ensuing year.\r\n\r\nA further appropriation will also be necessary for repairing fortifications\r\nalready established and the erection of such other works as may have real\r\neffect in obstructing the approach of an enemy to our sea port towns, or\r\ntheir remaining before them.\r\n\r\nIn a country whose constitution is derived from the will of the people,\r\ndirectly expressed by their free suffrages; where the principal executive\r\nfunctionaries and those of the legislature are renewed by them at short\r\nperiods; where under the character of jurors they exercise in person the\r\ngreatest portion of the judiciary powers; where the laws are consequently\r\nso formed and administered as to bear with equal weight and favor on all,\r\nrestraining no man in the pursuits of honest industry and securing to\r\neveryone the property which that acquires, it would not be supposed that\r\nany safe-guards could be needed against insurrection or enterprise on the\r\npublic peace or authority. The laws, however, aware that these should not\r\nbe trusted to moral restraints only, have wisely provided punishment for\r\nthese crimes when committed. But would it not be salutary to give also the\r\nmeans of preventing their commission? Where an enterprise is meditated by\r\nprivate individuals against a foreign nation in amity with the United\r\nStates, powers of prevention to a certain extent are given by the laws.\r\nWould they not be as reasonable and useful where the enterprise preparing\r\nis against the United States? While adverting to this branch of law it is\r\nproper to observe that in enterprises meditated against foreign nations the\r\nordinary process of binding to the observance of the peace and good\r\nbehavior, could it be extended to acts to be done out of the jurisdiction\r\nof the United States, would be effectual in some cases where the offender\r\nis able to keep out of sight every indication of his purpose which could\r\ndraw on him the exercise of the powers now given by law.\r\n\r\nThe States on the coast of Barbary seem generally disposed at present to\r\nrespect our peace and friendship; with Tunis alone some uncertainty\r\nremains. Persuaded that it is our interest to maintain our peace with them\r\non equal terms or not at all, I propose to send in due time a reenforcement\r\ninto the Mediterranean unless previous information shall show it to be\r\nunnecessary.\r\n\r\nWe continue to receive proofs of the growing attachment of our Indian\r\nneighbors and of their dispositions to place all their interests under the\r\npatronage of the United States. These dispositions are inspired by their\r\nconfidence in our justice and in the sincere concern we feel for their\r\nwelfare; and as long as we discharge these high and honorable functions\r\nwith the integrity and good faith which alone can entitle us to their\r\ncontinuance we may expect to reap the just reward in their peace and\r\nfriendship.\r\n\r\nThe expedition of Messrs. Lewis and Clarke for exploring the river Missouri\r\nand the best communication from that to the Pacific Ocean has had all the\r\nsuccess which could have been expected. They have traced the Missouri\r\nnearly to its source, descended the Columbia to the Pacific Ocean,\r\nascertained with accuracy the geography of that interesting communication\r\nacross our continent, learnt the character of the country, of its commerce\r\nand inhabitants; and it is but justice to say that Messrs. Lewis and Clarke\r\nand their brave companions have by this arduous service deserved well of\r\ntheir country.\r\n\r\nThe attempt to explore the Red River, under the direction of Mr. Freeman,\r\nthough conducted with a zeal and prudence meriting entire approbation, has\r\nnot been equally successful. After proceeding up it about six hundred\r\nmiles, nearly as far as the French settlements had extended while the\r\ncountry was in their possession, our geographers were obliged to return\r\nwithout completing their work.\r\n\r\nVery useful additions have also been made to our knowledge of the\r\nMississippi by Lieutenant Pike, who has ascended it to its source, and\r\nwhose journal and map, giving the details of his journey, will shortly be\r\nready for communication to both Houses of Congress. Those of Messrs. Lewis,\r\nClarke, and Freeman will require further time to be digested and prepared.\r\nThese important surveys, in addition to those before possessed, furnish\r\nmaterials for commencing an accurate map of the Mississippi and its western\r\nwaters. Some principal rivers, however, remain still to be explored, toward\r\nwhich the authorization of Congress by moderate appropriations will be\r\nrequisite.\r\n\r\nI congratulate you, fellow citizens, on the approach of the period at which\r\nyou may interpose your authority constitutionally to withdraw the citizens\r\nof the United States from all further participation in those violations of\r\nhuman rights which have been so long continued on the unoffending\r\ninhabitants of Africa, and which the morality, the reputation, and the best\r\nof our country have long been eager to proscribe. Although no law you may\r\npass can take prohibitory effect until the first day of the year 1808,\r\nyet the intervening period is not too long to prevent by timely notice\r\nexpeditions which can not be completed before that day.\r\n\r\nThe receipts at the Treasury during the year ending on the 30th day of\r\nSeptember last have amounted to near $15 millions, which have enabled us,\r\nafter meeting the current demands, to pay $2.7 millions of the American\r\nclaims in part of the price of Louisiana; to pay of the funded debt upward\r\nof $3 millions of principal and nearly $4 millions of interest, and, in\r\naddition, to reimburse in the course of the present month near $2\r\nmillions of 5.5% stock. These payments and reimbursements of the funded\r\ndebt, with those which had been made in the four years and a half\r\npreceding, will at the close of the present year have extinguished upward\r\nof $23 millions of principal.\r\n\r\nThe duties composing the Mediterranean fund will cease by law at the end of\r\nthe present session. Considering, however, that they are levied chiefly on\r\nluxuries and that we have an impost on salt, a necessary of life, the free\r\nuse of which otherwise is so important, I recommend to your consideration\r\nthe suppression of the duties on salt and the continuation of the\r\nMediterranean fund instead thereof for a short time, after which that also\r\nwill become unnecessary for any purpose now within contemplation.\r\n\r\nWhen both of these branches of revenue shall in this way be relinquished\r\nthere will still ere long be an accumulation of moneys in the Treasury\r\nbeyond the installments of public debt which we are permitted by contract\r\nto pay. They can not then, without a modification assented to by the public\r\ncreditors, be applied to the extinguishment of this debt and the complete\r\nliberation of our revenues, the most desirable of all objects. Nor, if our\r\npeace continues, will they be wanting for any other existing purpose. The\r\nquestion therefore now comes forward, To what other objects shall these\r\nsurpluses be appropriated, and the whole surplus of impost, after the\r\nentire discharge of the public debt, and during those intervals when the\r\npurposes of war shall not call for them? Shall we suppress the impost and\r\ngive that advantage to foreign over domestic manufactures? On a few\r\narticles of more general and necessary use the suppression in due season\r\nwill doubtless be right, but the great mass of the articles on which impost\r\nis paid are foreign luxuries, purchased by those only who are rich enough\r\nto afford themselves the use of them.\r\n\r\nTheir patriotism would certainly prefer its continuance and application to\r\nthe great purposes of the public education, roads, rivers, canals, and such\r\nother objects of public improvement as it may be thought proper to add to\r\nthe constitutional enumeration of Federal powers. By these operations new\r\nchannels of communications will be opened between the States, the lines of\r\nseparation will disappear, their interests will be identified, and their\r\nunion cemented by new and indissoluble ties. Education is here placed among\r\nthe articles of public care, not that it would be proposed to take its\r\nordinary branches out of the hands of private enterprise, which manages so\r\nmuch better all the concerns to which it is equal, but a public institution\r\ncan alone supply those sciences which though rarely called for are yet\r\nnecessary to complete the circle, all the parts of which contribute to the\r\nimprovement of the country and some of them to its preservation.\r\n\r\nThe subject is now proposed for the consideration of Congress, because if\r\napproved by the time the State legislatures shall have deliberated on this\r\nextension of the Federal trusts, and the laws shall be passed and other\r\narrangements made for their execution, the necessary funds will be on hand\r\nand without employment.\r\n\r\nI suppose an amendment to the Constitution, by consent of the States,\r\nnecessary, because the objects now recommended are not among those\r\nenumerated in the Constitution, and to which it permits the public moneys\r\nto be applied.\r\n\r\nThe present consideration of a national establishment for education\r\nparticularly is rendered proper by this circumstance also, that if\r\nCongress, approving the proposition, shall yet think it more eligible to\r\nfound it on a donation of lands, they have it now in their power to endow\r\nit with those which will be among the earliest to produce the necessary\r\nincome. This foundation would have the advantage of being independent of\r\nwar, which may suspend other improvements by requiring for its own purposes\r\nthe resources destined for them.\r\n\r\nThis, fellow citizens, is the state of the public interests at the present\r\nmoment and according to the information now possessed. But such is the\r\nsituation of the nations of Europe and such, too, the predicament in which\r\nwe stand with some of them that we can not rely with certainty on the\r\npresent aspect of our affairs, that may change from moment to moment during\r\nthe course of your session or after you shall have separated.\r\n\r\nOur duty is, therefore, to act upon things as they are and to make a\r\nreasonable provision for whatever they may be. Were armies to be raised\r\nwhenever a speck of war is visible in our horizon, we never should have\r\nbeen without them. Our resources would have been exhausted on dangers which\r\nhave never happened, instead of being reserved for what is really to take\r\nplace. A steady, perhaps a quickened, pace in preparation for the defense\r\nof our sea port towns and waters; an early settlement of the most exposed\r\nand vulnerable parts of our country; a militia so organized that its\r\neffective portions can be called to any point in the Union, or volunteers\r\ninstead of them to serve a sufficient time, are means which may always be\r\nready, yet never preying on our resources until actually called into use.\r\nThey will maintain the public interests while a more permanent force shall\r\nbe in course of preparation. But much will depend on the promptitude with\r\nwhich these means can be brought into activity. If war be forced upon us,\r\nin spite of our long and vain appeals to the justice of nations, rapid and\r\nvigorous movements in its outset will go far toward securing us in its\r\ncourse and issue, and toward throwing its burthens on those who render\r\nnecessary the resort from reason to force.\r\n\r\nThe result of our negotiations, or such incidents in their course as may\r\nenable us to infer their probable issue; such further movements also on our\r\nwestern frontiers as may shew whether war is to be pressed there while\r\nnegotiation is protracted elsewhere, shall be communicated to you from time\r\nto time as they become known to me, with whatever other information I\r\npossess or may receive, which may aid your deliberations on the great\r\nnational interests committed to your charge.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nThomas Jefferson\r\nOctober 27, 1807\r\n\r\nThe Senate and House of Representatives of the United States:\r\n\r\nCircumstances, fellow citizens, which seriously threatened the peace of our\r\ncountry have made it a duty to convene you at an earlier period than usual.\r\nThe love of peace so much cherished in the bosoms of our citizens, which\r\nhas so long guided the proceedings of their public councils and induced\r\nforbearance under so many wrongs, may not insure our continuance in the\r\nquiet pursuits of industry. The many injuries and depredations committed on\r\nour commerce and navigation upon the high seas for years past, the\r\nsuccessive innovations on those principles of public law which have been\r\nestablished by the reason and usage of nations as the rule of their\r\nintercourse and the umpire and security of their rights and peace, and all\r\nthe circumstances which induced the extraordinary mission to London are\r\nalready known to you.\r\n\r\nThe instructions given to our ministers were framed in the sincerest spirit\r\nof amity and moderation. They accordingly proceeded, in conformity\r\ntherewith, to propose arrangements which might embrace and settle all the\r\npoints in difference between us, which might bring us to a mutual\r\nunderstanding on our neutral and national rights and provide for a\r\ncommercial intercourse on conditions of some equality. After long and\r\nfruitless endeavors to effect the purposes of their mission and to obtain\r\narrangements within the limits of their instructions, they concluded to\r\nsign such as could be obtained and to send them for consideration, candidly\r\ndeclaring to the other negotiators at the same time that they were acting\r\nagainst their instructions, and that their Government, therefore, could not\r\nbe pledged for ratification.\r\n\r\nSome of the articles proposed might have been admitted on a principle of\r\ncompromise, but others were too highly disadvantageous, and no sufficient\r\nprovision was made against the principal source of the irritations and\r\ncollisions which were constantly endangering the peace of the two nations.\r\nThe question, therefore, whether a treaty should be accepted in that form\r\ncould have admitted but of one decision, even had no declarations of the\r\nother party impaired our confidence in it. Still anxious not to close the\r\ndoor against friendly adjustment, new modifications were framed and further\r\nconcessions authorized than could before have been supposed necessary; and\r\nour ministers were instructed to resume their negotiations on these\r\ngrounds.\r\n\r\nOn this new reference to amicable discussion we were reposing in\r\nconfidence, when on the 22nd day of June last by a formal order from a\r\nBritish admiral the frigate Chesapeake, leaving her port for a distant\r\nservice, was attacked by one of those vessels which had been lying in our\r\nharbors under the indulgences of hospitality, was disabled from proceeding,\r\nhad several of her crew killed and four taken away. On this outrage no\r\ncommentaries are necessary. Its character has been pronounced by the\r\nindignant voices of our citizens with an emphasis and unanimity never\r\nexceeded. I immediately, by proclamation, interdicted our harbors and\r\nwaters to all British armed vessels, forbade intercourse with them, and\r\nuncertain how far hostilities were intended, and the town of Norfolk,\r\nindeed, being threatened with immediate attack, a sufficient force was\r\nordered for the protection of that place, and such other preparations\r\ncommenced and pursued as the prospect rendered proper. An armed vessel of\r\nthe United States was dispatched with instructions to our ministers at\r\nLondon to call on that Government for the satisfaction and security\r\nrequired by the outrage. A very short interval ought now to bring the\r\nanswer, which shall be communicated to you as soon as received; then also,\r\nor as soon after as the public interests shall be found to admit, the\r\nunratified treaty and proceedings relative to it shall be made known to\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nThe aggression thus begun has been continued on the part of the British\r\ncommanders by remaining within our waters in defiance of the authority of\r\nthe country, by habitual violations of its jurisdiction, and at length by\r\nputting to death one of the persons whom they had forcibly taken from on\r\nboard the Chesapeake. These aggravations necessarily lead to the policy\r\neither of never admitting an armed vessel into our harbors or of\r\nmaintaining in every harbor such an armed force as may constrain obedience\r\nto the laws and protect the lives and property of our citizens against\r\ntheir armed guests; but the expense of such a standing force and its\r\ninconsistence with our principles dispense with those courtesies which\r\nwould necessarily call for it, and leave us equally free to exclude the\r\nnavy, as we are the army, of a foreign power from entering our limits.\r\n\r\nTo former violations of maritime rights another is now added of very\r\nextensive effect. The Government of that nation has issued an order\r\ninterdicting all trade by neutrals between ports not in amity with them;\r\nand being now at war with nearly every nation on the Atlantic and\r\nMediterranean seas, our vessels are required to sacrifice their cargoes at\r\nthe first port they touch or to return home without the benefit of going to\r\nany other market. Under this new law of the ocean our trade on the\r\nMediterranean has been swept away by seizures and condemnations, and that\r\nin other seas is threatened with the same fate.\r\n\r\nOur differences with Spain remain still unsettled, no measure having been\r\ntaken on her part since my last communications to Congress to bring them to\r\na close. But under a state of things which may favor reconsideration they\r\nhave been recently pressed, and an expectation is entertained that they may\r\nnow soon be brought to an issue of some sort. With their subjects on our\r\nborders no new collisions have taken place nor seem immediately to be\r\napprehended. To our former grounds of complaint has been added a very\r\nserious one, as you will see by the decree a copy of which is now\r\ncommunicated. Whether this decree, which professes to be conformable to\r\nthat of the French Government of November 21st, 1806, heretofore\r\ncommunicated to Congress, will also be conformed to that in its\r\nconstruction and application in relation to the United States had not\r\nbeen ascertained at the date of our last communications. These, however,\r\ngave reason to expect such a conformity.\r\n\r\nWith the other nations of Europe our harmony has been uninterrupted, and\r\ncommerce and friendly intercourse have been maintained on their usual\r\nfooting.\r\n\r\nOur peace with the several states on the coast of Barbary appears as firm\r\nas at any former period and as likely to continue as that of any other\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nAmong our Indian neighbors in the northwestern quarter some fermentation\r\nwas observed soon after the late occurrences, threatening the continuance\r\nof our peace. Messages were said to be interchanged and tokens to be\r\npassing, which usually denote a state of restless among them, and the\r\ncharacter of the agitators pointed to the sources of excitement. Measures\r\nwere immediately taken for providing against that danger; instructions were\r\ngiven to require explanations, and, with assurances of our continued\r\nfriendship, to admonish the tribes to remain quiet at home, taking no part\r\nin quarrels not belonging to them. As far as we are yet informed, the\r\ntribes in our vicinity, who are most advanced in the pursuits of industry,\r\nare sincerely disposed to adhere to their friendship with us and to their\r\npeace with all others, while those more remote do not present appearances\r\nsufficiently quiet to justify the intermission of military precaution on\r\nour part.\r\n\r\nThe great tribes on our southwestern quarter, much advanced beyond the\r\nothers in agriculture and household arts, appear tranquil and identifying\r\ntheir views with ours in proportion to their advancement. With the whole of\r\nthese people, in every quarter, I shall continue to inculcate peace and\r\nfriendship with all their neighbors and perseverance in those occupations\r\nand pursuits which will best promote their own well-being.\r\n\r\nThe appropriations of the last session for the defense of our sea port\r\ntowns and harbors were made under expectation that a continuance of our\r\npeace would permit us to proceed in that work according to our convenience.\r\nIt has been thought better to apply the sums then given toward the defense\r\nof New York, Charleston, and New Orleans chiefly, as most open and most\r\nlikely first to need protection, and to leave places less immediately in\r\ndanger to the provisions of the present session.\r\n\r\nThe gun boats, too, already provided have on a like principle been chiefly\r\nassigned to New York, New Orleans, and the Chesapeake. Whether our movable\r\nforce on the water, so material in aid of the defensive works on the land,\r\nshould be augmented in this or any other form is left to the wisdom of the\r\nLegislature. For the purpose of manning these vessels in sudden attacks on\r\nour harbors it is a matter for consideration whether the sea men of the\r\nUnited States may not justly be formed into a special militia, to be called\r\non for tours of duty in defense of the harbors where they shall happen to\r\nbe, the ordinary militia of the place furnishing that portion which may\r\nconsist of landsmen.\r\n\r\nThe moment our peace was threatened I deemed it indispensable to secure a\r\ngreater provision of those articles of military stores with which our\r\nmagazines were not sufficiently furnished. To have awaited a previous and\r\nspecial sanction by law would have lost occasions which might not be\r\nretrieved. I did not hesitate, therefore, to authorize engagements for such\r\nsupplements to our existing stock as would render it adequate to the\r\nemergencies threatening us, and I trust that the Legislature, feeling the\r\nsame anxiety for the safety of our country, so materially advanced by this\r\nprecaution, will approve, when done, what they would have seen so important\r\nto be done if then assembled. Expenses, also unprovided for, arose out of\r\nthe necessity of calling all our gun boats into actual service for the\r\ndefense of our harbors; all of which accounts will be laid before you.\r\n\r\nWhether a regular army is to be raised, and to what extent, must depend on\r\nthe information so shortly expected. In the mean time I have called on the\r\nStates for quotas of militia, to be in readiness for present defense, and\r\nhave, moreover, encouraged the acceptance of volunteers; and I am happy to\r\ninform you that these have offered themselves with great alacrity in every\r\npart of the Union. They are ordered to be organized and ready at a\r\nmoment's warning to proceed on any service to which they may be\r\ncalled, and every preparation within the Executive powers has been made to\r\ninsure us the benefit of early exertions.\r\n\r\nI informed Congress at their last session of the enterprises against the\r\npublic peace which were believed to be in preparation by Aaron Burr and his\r\nassociates, of the measures taken to defeat them and to bring the offenders\r\nto justice. Their enterprises were happily defeated by the patriotic\r\nexertions of the militia whenever called into action, by the fidelity of\r\nthe Army, and energy of the commander in chief in promptly arranging the\r\ndifficulties presenting themselves on the Sabine, repairing to meet those\r\narising on the Mississippi, and dissipating before their explosion plots\r\nengendering there. I shall think it my duty to lay before you the\r\nproceedings and the evidence publicly exhibited on the arraignment of the\r\nprincipal offenders before the circuit court of Virginia.\r\n\r\nYou will be enabled to judge whether the defect was in the testimony, in\r\nthe law, or in the administration of the law; and wherever it shall be\r\nfound, the Legislature alone can apply or originate the remedy. The framers\r\nof our Constitution certainly supposed they had guarded as well their\r\nGovernment against destruction by treason as their citizens against\r\noppression under pretense of it, and if these ends are not attained it is\r\nof importance to inquire by what means more effectual they may be secured.\r\n\r\nThe accounts of the receipts of revenue during the year ending on the 30th\r\nday of September last being not yet made up, a correct statement will be\r\nhereafter transmitted from the Treasury. In the mean time, it is\r\nascertained that the receipts have amounted to near $16 millions, which,\r\nwith the $5.5 millions in the Treasury at the beginning of the year, have\r\nenabled us, after meeting the current demands and interest incurred, to\r\npay more than $4 millions of the principal of our funded debt. These\r\npayments, with those of the preceding five and a half years, have\r\nextinguished of the funded debt $25.5 millions, being the whole which\r\ncould be paid or purchased within the limits of the law and of our\r\ncontracts, and have left us in the Treasury $8.5 millions.\r\n\r\nA portion of this sum may be considered as a commencement of accumulation\r\nof the surpluses of revenue which, after paying the installments of debt as\r\nthey shall become payable, will remain without any specific object. It may\r\npartly, indeed, be applied toward completing the defense of the exposed\r\npoints of our country, on such a scale as shall be adapted to our\r\nprinciples and circumstances. This object is doubtless among the first\r\nentitled to attention in such a state of our finances, and it is one which,\r\nwhether we have peace or war, will provide security where it is due.\r\nWhether what shall remain of this, with the future surpluses, may be\r\nusefully applied to purposes already authorized or more usefully to others\r\nrequiring new authorities, or how otherwise they shall be disposed of, are\r\nquestions calling for the notice of Congress, unless, indeed, they shall be\r\nsuperseded by a change in our public relations now awaiting the\r\ndetermination of others. Whatever be that determination, it is a great\r\nconsolation that it will become known at a moment when the supreme council\r\nof the nation is assembled at its post, and ready to give the aids of its\r\nwisdom and authority to whatever course the good of our country shall then\r\ncall us to pursue.\r\n\r\nMatters of minor importance will be the subjects of future communications,\r\nand nothing shall be wanting on my part which may give information or\r\ndispatch to the proceedings of the Legislature in the exercise of their\r\nhigh duties, and at a moment so interesting to the public welfare.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nThomas Jefferson\r\nNovember 8, 1808\r\n\r\nThe Senate and House of Representatives of the United States:\r\n\r\nIt would have been a source, fellow citizens, of much gratification if our\r\nlast communications from Europe had enabled me to inform you that the\r\nbelligerent nations, whose disregard of neutral rights has been so\r\ndestructive to our commerce, had become awakened to the duty and true\r\npolicy of revoking their unrighteous edicts. That no means might be omitted\r\nto produce this salutary effect, I lost no time in availing myself of the\r\nact authorizing a suspension, in whole or in part, of the several embargo\r\nlaws. Our ministers at London and Paris were instructed to explain to the\r\nrespective Governments there our disposition to exercise the authority in\r\nsuch manner as would withdraw the pretext on which the aggressions were\r\noriginally founded and open the way for a renewal of that commercial\r\nintercourse which it was alleged on all sides had been reluctantly\r\nobstructed.\r\n\r\nAs each of those Governments had pledged its readiness to concur in\r\nrenouncing a measure which reached its adversary through the incontestable\r\nrights of neutrals only, and as the measure had been assumed by each as a\r\nretaliation for an asserted acquiescence in the aggression of the other, it\r\nwas reasonably expected that the occasion would have been seized by both\r\nfor evincing the sincerity of their professions, and for restoring to the\r\ncommerce of the United States its legitimate freedom. The instructions to\r\nour ministers with respect to the different belligerents were necessarily\r\nmodified with a reference to their different circumstances, and to the\r\ncondition annexed by law to the Executive power of suspension, requiring a\r\ndecree of security to our commerce which would not result from a repeal of\r\nthe decrees of France. Instead of a pledge, therefore, of a suspension of\r\nthe embargo as to her in case of such a repeal, it was presumed that a\r\nsufficient inducement might be found in other considerations, and\r\nparticularly in the change produced by a compliance with our just demands\r\nby one belligerent and a refusal by the other in the relations between the\r\nother and the United States.\r\n\r\nTo Great Britain, whose power on the ocean is so ascendant, it was deemed\r\nnot inconsistent with that condition to state explicitly that on her\r\nrescinding her orders in relation to the United States their trade would be\r\nopened with her, and remain shut to her enemy in case of his failure to\r\nrescind his decrees also. From France no answer has been received, nor any\r\nindication that the requisite change in her decrees is contemplated. The\r\nfavorable reception of the proposition to Great Britain was the less to be\r\ndoubted, as her orders of council had not only been referred for their\r\nvindication to an acquiescence on the part of the United States no longer\r\nto be pretended, but as the arrangement proposed, whilst it resisted the\r\nillegal decrees of France, involved, moreover, substantially the precise\r\nadvantages professedly aimed at by the British orders. The arrangement has\r\nnevertheless been rejected.\r\n\r\nThis candid and liberal experiment having thus failed, and no other event\r\nhaving occurred on which a suspension of the embargo by the Executive was\r\nauthorized, it necessarily remains in the extent originally given to it. We\r\nhave the satisfaction, however, to reflect that in return for the\r\nprivations imposed by the measure, and which our fellow citizens in general\r\nhave borne with patriotism, it has had the important effects of saving our\r\nmariners and our vast mercantile property, as well as of affording time for\r\nprosecuting the defensive and provisional measures called for by the\r\noccasion. It has demonstrated to foreign nations the moderation and\r\nfirmness which govern our councils, and to our citizens the necessity of\r\nuniting in support of the laws and the rights of their country, and has\r\nthus long frustrated those usurpations and spoliations which, if resisted,\r\ninvolved war; if submitted to, sacrificed a vital principle of our national\r\nindependence.\r\n\r\nUnder a continuance of the belligerent measures which, in defiance of laws\r\nwhich consecrate the rights of neutrals, overspread the ocean with danger,\r\nit will rest with the wisdom of Congress to decide on the course best\r\nadapted to such a state of things; and bringing with them, as they do, from\r\nevery part of the Union the sentiments of our constituents, my confidence\r\nis strengthened that in forming this decision they will, with an unerring\r\nregard to the essential rights and interests of the nation, weigh and\r\ncompare the painful alternatives out of which a choice is to be made. Nor\r\nshould I do justice to the virtues which on other occasions have marked the\r\ncharacter of our fellow citizens if I did not cherish an equal confidence\r\nthat the alternative chosen, whatever it may be, will be maintained with\r\nall the fortitude and patriotism which the crisis ought to inspire.\r\n\r\nThe documents containing the correspondences on the subject of the foreign\r\nedicts against our commerce, with the instructions given to our ministers\r\nat London and Paris, are now laid before you.\r\n\r\nThe communications made to Congress at their last session explained the\r\nposture in which the close of the discussions relating to the attack by a\r\nBritish ship of war on the frigate Chesapeake left a subject on which the\r\nnation had manifested so honorable a sensibility. Every view of what had\r\npassed authorized a belief that immediate steps would be taken by the\r\nBritish Government for redressing a wrong which the more it was\r\ninvestigated appeared the more clearly to require what had not been\r\nprovided for in the special mission. It is found that no steps have been\r\ntaken for the purpose. On the contrary, it will be seen in the documents\r\nlaid before you that the inadmissible preliminary which obstructed the\r\nadjustment is still adhered to, and, moreover, that it is now brought into\r\nconnection with the distinct and irrelative case of the orders in council.\r\nThe instructions which had been given to our minister at London with a view\r\nto facilitate, if necessary, the reparation claimed by the United States\r\nare included in the documents communicated.\r\n\r\nOur relations with the other powers of Europe have undergone no material\r\nchanges since your last session. The important negotiations with Spain\r\nwhich had been alternately suspended and resumed necessarily experience a\r\npause under the extraordinary and interesting crisis which distinguishes\r\nher internal situation.\r\n\r\nWith the Barbary Powers we continue in harmony, with the exception of an\r\nunjustifiable proceeding of the Dey of Algiers toward our consul to that\r\nRegency. Its character and circumstances are now laid before you, and will\r\nenable you to decide how far it may, either now or hereafter, call for any\r\nmeasures not within the limits of the Executive authority.\r\n\r\nWith our Indian neighbors the public peace has been steadily maintained.\r\nSome instances of individual wrong have, as at other times, taken place,\r\nbut in no wise implicating the will of the nation. Beyond the Mississippi\r\nthe Ioways, the Sacs and the Alabamas have delivered up for trial and\r\npunishment individuals from among themselves accused of murdering citizens\r\nof the United States. On this side of the Mississippi the Creeks are\r\nexerting themselves to arrest offenders of the same kind, and the Choctaws\r\nhave manifested their readiness and desire for amicable and just\r\narrangements respecting depredations committed by disorderly persons of\r\ntheir tribe. And, generally, from a conviction that we consider them as a\r\npart of ourselves, and cherish with sincerity their rights and interests,\r\nthe attachment of the Indian tribes is gaining strength daily--is\r\nextending from the nearer to the more remote, and will amply requite us for\r\nthe justice and friendship practiced toward them. Husbandry and household\r\nmanufacture are advancing among them more rapidly with the Southern than\r\nNorthern tribes, from circumstances of soil and climate, and one of the two\r\ngreat divisions of the Cherokee Nation have now under consideration to\r\nsolicit the citizenship of the United States, and to be identified with us\r\nin laws and government in such progressive manner as we shall think best.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the appropriations of the last session of Congress for\r\nthe security of our sea port towns and harbors, such works of defense have\r\nbeen erected as seemed to be called for by the situation of the several\r\nplaces, their relative importance, and the scale of expense indicated by\r\nthe amount of the appropriation. These works will chiefly be finished in\r\nthe course of the present season, except at New York and New Orleans, where\r\nmost was to be done; and although a great proportion of the last\r\nappropriation has been expended on the former place, yet some further views\r\nwill be submitted to Congress for rendering its security entirely adequate\r\nagainst naval enterprise. A view of what has been done at the several\r\nplaces, and of what is proposed to be done, shall be communicated as soon\r\nas the several reports are received.\r\n\r\nOf the gun boats authorized by the act of December last, it has been\r\nthought necessary to build only one hundred and three in the present year.\r\nThese, with those before possessed, are sufficient for the harbors and\r\nwaters most exposed, and the residents will require little time for their\r\nconstruction when it shall be deemed necessary.\r\n\r\nUnder the act of the last session for raising an additional military force\r\nso many officers were immediately appointed as were necessary for carrying\r\non the business of recruiting, and in proportion as it advanced others have\r\nbeen added. We have reason to believe their success has been satisfactory,\r\nalthough such returns have not yet been received as enable me to present\r\nyou a statement of the numbers engaged.\r\n\r\nI have not thought it necessary in the course of the last season to call\r\nfor any general detachments of militia or of volunteers under the laws\r\npassed for that purpose. For the ensuing season, however, they will be\r\nrequired to be in readiness should their service be wanted. Some small and\r\nspecial detachments have been necessary to maintain the laws of embargo on\r\nthat portion of our northern frontier which offered peculiar facilities for\r\nevasion, but these were replaced as soon as it could be done by bodies of\r\nnew recruits. By the aid of these and of the armed vessels called into\r\nservice in other quarters the spirit of disobedience and abuse, which\r\nmanifested itself early and with sensible effect while we were unprepared\r\nto meet it, has been considerably repressed.\r\n\r\nConsidering the extraordinary character of the times in which we live, our\r\nattention should unremittingly be fixed on the safety of our country. For a\r\npeople who are free, and who mean to remain so, a well organized and armed\r\nmilitia is their best security. It is therefore incumbent on us at every\r\nmeeting to revise the condition of the militia, and to ask ourselves if it\r\nis prepared to repel a powerful enemy at every point of our territories\r\nexposed to invasion. Some of the States have paid a laudable attention to\r\nthis object, but every degree of neglect is to be found among others.\r\nCongress alone having the power to produce an uniform state of preparation\r\nin this great organ of defense, the interests which they so deeply feel in\r\ntheir own and their country's security will present this as among the most\r\nimportant objects of their deliberation.\r\n\r\nUnder the acts of March 11th and April 23rd respecting arms, the\r\ndifficulty of procuring them from abroad during the present situation\r\nand dispositions of Europe induced us to direct our whole efforts to the\r\nmeans of internal supply. The public factories have therefore been\r\nenlarged, additional machineries erected, and, in proportion as\r\nartificers can be found or formed, their effect, already more than\r\ndoubled, may be increased so as to keep pace with the yearly increase\r\nof the militia. The annual sums appropriated by the latter have been\r\ndirected to the encouragement of private factories of arms, and contracts\r\nhave been entered into with individual undertakers to nearly the amount\r\nof the first year's appropriation.\r\n\r\nThe suspension of our foreign commerce, produced by the injustice of the\r\nbelligerent powers and the consequent losses and sacrifices of our citizens\r\nare subjects of just concern. The situation into which we have thus been\r\nforced has impelled us to apply a portion of our industry and capital to\r\ninternal manufactures and improvements. The extent of this conversion is\r\ndaily increasing, and little doubt remains that the establishments formed\r\nand forming will, under the auspices of cheaper materials and subsistence,\r\nthe freedom of labor from taxation with us, and of protecting duties and\r\nprohibitions, become permanent. The commerce with the Indians, too, within\r\nour own boundaries is likely to receive abundant aliment from the same\r\ninternal source, and will secure to them peace and the progress of\r\ncivilization, undisturbed by practices hostile to both.\r\n\r\nThe accounts of the receipts and expenditures during the year ending the\r\n30th of September last being not yet made up, a correct statement will\r\nhereafter be transmitted from the Treasury. In the mean time it is\r\nascertained that the receipts have amounted to near $18 millions, which,\r\nwith the $8.5 millions in the Treasury at the beginning of the year, have\r\nenabled us, after meeting the current demands and interest incurred, to\r\npay $2.3 millions of the principal of our funded debt, and left us in\r\nthe Treasury on that day near $14 millions. Of these, $5.35 millions will\r\nbe necessary to pay what will be due on the 1st day of January next, which\r\nwill complete the reimbursement of the 8% stock. These payments, with\r\nthose made in the six and a half years preceding, will have extinguished\r\n$33.58 millions of the principal of the funded debt, being the whole which\r\ncould be paid or purchased within the limits of the law and of our\r\ncontracts, and the amount of principal thus discharged will have liberated\r\nthe revenue from about $2 millions of interest and added that sum annually\r\nto the disposable surplus.\r\n\r\nThe probable accumulation of the surpluses of revenue beyond what can be\r\napplied to the payment of the public debt whenever the freedom and safety\r\nof our commerce shall be restored merits the consideration of Congress.\r\nShall it lie unproductive in the public vaults? Shall the revenue be\r\nreduced? Or shall it not rather be appropriated to the improvements of\r\nroads, canals, rivers, education, and other great foundations of prosperity\r\nand union under the powers which Congress may already possess or such\r\namendment to the Constitution as may be approved by the States? While\r\nuncertain of the course of things, the time may be advantageously employed\r\nin obtaining the powers necessary for a system of improvement, should that\r\nbe thought best.\r\n\r\nAvailing myself of this the last occasion which will occur of addressing\r\nthe two Houses of the Legislature at their meeting, I can not omit the\r\nexpression of my sincere gratitude for the repeated proofs of confidence\r\nmanifested to me by themselves and their predecessors since my call to the\r\nadministration and the many indulgences experienced at their hands. These\r\nsame grateful acknowledgements are due to my fellow citizens generally,\r\nwhose support has been my great encouragement under all embarrassments. In\r\nthe transaction of their business I can not have escaped error. It is\r\nincident to our imperfect nature. But I may say with truth my errors have\r\nbeen of the understanding, not of intention, and that the advancement of\r\ntheir rights and interests has been the constant motive for every measure.\r\nOn these considerations I solicit their indulgence. Looking forward with\r\nanxiety to future destinies, I trust that in their steady character,\r\nunshaken by difficulties, in their love of liberty, obedience to law, and\r\nsupport of the public authorities, I see a sure guaranty of the permanence\r\nof our Republic; and, retiring from the charge of their affairs, I carry\r\nwith me the consolation of a firm persuasion that Heaven has in store for\r\nour beloved country long ages to come of prosperity and happiness.\r\n\r\nTH.
