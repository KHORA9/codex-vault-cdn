Before the death of Susan B. Anthony in 1906, Suffragists had\r\nturned their attention to the States. Suffrage agitation there was\r\npersistent, vigorous, and untiring; in Washington, it was merely\r\nperfunctory. The National American Woman Suffrage Association maintained\r\na Congressional Committee in Washington, but no Headquarters. This\r\nCommittee arranged for one formal hearing before the Senate and the\r\nHouse Committee of each Congress. The speeches were used as propaganda\r\nmailed on a Congressman’s frank. The Suffrage Amendment had never in the\r\nhistory of the country been brought to a vote in the National House of\r\nRepresentatives, and had only once, in 1887, been voted upon in the\r\nSenate. It had not received a favorable report from the Committee in\r\neither House since 1892 and had not received a report of any kind since\r\n1896. Suffrage had not been debated on the floor of either House since\r\n1887. In addition, the incoming President, Woodrow Wilson, if not\r\nactually opposed to the enfranchisement of women, gave no appearance of\r\nfavoring it; the great political Parties were against it. Political\r\nleaders generally were unwilling to be connected with it. Congress\r\nlacked—it is scarcely exaggeration to say—several hundreds of the votes\r\nnecessary to pass the Amendment. Last of all the majority of Suffragists\r\ndid not think the Federal Amendment a practical possibility. They were\r\nentirely engrossed in State campaigns.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the Suffrage movement, itself, was virile and vital.\r\nThe fourth generation of women to espouse this cause were throwing\r\nthemselves into the work with all the power and force of their able,\r\naroused, and emancipate generation. The franchise had been granted in\r\nsix States: Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, Idaho, Washington, California. With\r\nthe winning of Oregon, Kansas, and Arizona in 1912, the movement assumed\r\na new importance in the national field. These victories meant that there\r\nwere approximately two million women voters in the United States, that\r\none-fifth of the Senate, one-seventh of the House and one-sixth of the\r\nelectoral vote came from Suffrage States.\r\n\r\nIt was in December, 1912, as Chairman of the Congressional Committee of\r\nthe National American Woman Suffrage Association, that Alice Paul came\r\nto Washington.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the next eight years, this young woman was to bring into existence a\r\nnew political Party of fifty thousand members. She was to raise over\r\nthree-quarters of a million dollars. She was to establish a Headquarters\r\nin Washington that became the focus of the liberal forces of the\r\ncountry. She was to gather into her organization hundreds of devoted\r\nworkers; some without pay and others with less pay than they could\r\ncommand at other work or with other organizations. She was to introduce\r\ninto Suffrage agitation in the United States a policy which, though not\r\nnew in the political arena, was new to Suffrage—the policy of holding\r\nthe Party in power responsible. She was to institute a Suffrage campaign\r\nso swift, so intensive, so compelling—and at the same time so varied,\r\ninteresting, and picturesque—that again and again it pushed the war news\r\nout of the preferred position on the front pages of the newspapers of\r\nthe United States. She was to see her Party blaze a purple, white, and\r\ngold trail from the east to the west of the United States; and from the\r\nnorth to the south. She was to see the Susan B. Anthony Amendment pass\r\nfirst the House and then the Senate. She was to see thirty-seven States\r\nratify the Amendment in less than a year and a half thereafter. She was\r\nto see the President of the United States move from a position of what\r\nseemed definite opposition to the Suffrage cause to an open espousal of\r\nit; move slowly at first but with a progress which gradually accelerated\r\nuntil he, himself, obtained the last Senatorial vote necessary to pass\r\nthe Amendment.\r\n\r\nWhat was the training which had developed in Alice Paul this power and\r\nwhat were the qualities back of that training, which made it possible\r\nfor her to invent so masterly a plan, to pursue it so resistlessly?\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   II\r\n\r\n                               ALICE PAUL\r\n\r\n\r\n    I watched a river of women,\r\n    Rippling purple, white and golden,\r\n    Stream toward the National Capitol.\r\n\r\n    Along its border,\r\n    Like a purple flower floating,\r\n    Moved a young woman, worn, wraithlike,\r\n    With eyes alight, keenly observing the marchers.\r\n    Out there on the curb, she looked so little, so lonely;\r\n    Few appeared even to see her;\r\n    No one saluted her.\r\n\r\n    Yet commander was she of the column, its leader;\r\n    She was the spring whence arose that irresistible river of women\r\n    Streaming steadily towards the National Capitol.\r\n              KATHERINE ROLSTON FISHER,\r\n              _The Suffragist_, January 19, 1918.\r\n\r\nIT is an interesting coincidence that the woman who bore the greatest\r\nsingle part in the Suffrage fight at the beginning—Susan Anthony—and the\r\nwoman who bore the greatest single part at the end—Alice Paul—were both\r\nQuakers.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is very difficult to get Alice Paul to talk about herself. She is not\r\nmuch interested in herself and she is interested, with every atom of\r\nher, in the work she is doing. She will tell you, if you ask her, that\r\nshe was born in Moorestown, New Jersey, and then her interest seems to\r\ndie. She apparently does not remember herself very clearly either as a\r\nchild or a young girl. That is not strange. So intently has she worked\r\nin the last eight years and so intensely has she lived in that work that\r\neach year seems to have erased its predecessor. She is absolutely\r\nconcentrated on _now_. I asked Alice Paul once what converted her to\r\nWoman Suffrage. She said that she could not remember when she did not\r\nbelieve in it. She added, “You know the Quakers have always believed in\r\nWoman Suffrage.”\r\n\r\nAnne Herendeen, in a vivacious article on Alice Paul in _Everybody’s\r\nMagazine_ for October, 1919, says, describing a visit to Moorestown:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “What do you think of all these goings-on?” I asked her mother. She\r\n    sighed.\r\n\r\n    “Well, Mr. Paul always used to say, when there was anything hard and\r\n    disagreeable to be done, ‘I bank on Alice.’”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe degree of education in Alice Paul’s life and the amount of social\r\nservice which she had performed are a little staggering in view of her\r\nyouth. Just the list of the degrees she achieved and the positions she\r\nheld before she started the National Woman’s Party covers a typewritten\r\npage. They have even an unexpected international quality. One notes\r\nfirst—and without undue astonishment—that she acquired a B.A. at\r\nSwarthmore in 1905; an M.A. at the University of Pennsylvania in 1907; a\r\nPh.D. at the same university in 1912. This would seem enough to fill the\r\neducational leisure of most young women, but it does not by any means\r\ncomplete Alice Paul’s student career. She was a graduate of the New York\r\nSchool of Philanthropy in 1906. She was a student at the Woodbrooke\r\nSettlement for Social Work at Woodbrooke, Birmingham, and in the\r\nUniversity of Birmingham, England, in 1907-08; a graduate student in\r\nsociology and economics in the School of Economics of the University of\r\nLondon in 1908-09.\r\n\r\nShe was, in addition, a Resident Worker of the New York College\r\nSettlement in 1905-06; a Visitor for the New York Charity Organization\r\nSociety in the summer of 1906; a Worker in the Summer Lane Settlement,\r\nand a Visitor in the Charity Organization Society of Birmingham,\r\nEngland, during the winter of 1907-08; Assistant-secretary to the\r\nDalston Branch of the Charity Organization Society in London for a half\r\nyear in 1908; a Visitor for the Peel Institute for Social Work at\r\nClerkenwell, London, for a half year in 1908-09; a Resident Worker for\r\nthe Christian Social Union Settlement of Hoxton, London, in the summer\r\nof 1908. She was also in charge of the Women’s Department of the branch\r\nof adult schools at Hoxton in the summer of 1908.\r\n\r\nI asked Mabel Vernon, who went to Swarthmore with her, about Alice Paul.\r\nHer impressions were a little vague—mainly of a normal, average young\r\ngirl who had not yet begun to “show.” She remembered that, although\r\nbiology was her specialty, Miss Paul was catholic in her choice of\r\ncourses; how—as though it were something she expected to need—she took a\r\ngreat deal of Latin; and that—as though at the urge of the same\r\nintuition—she devoted herself to athletics. She had apparently no\r\nathletic gifts; yet before she left Swarthmore she was on the girls’\r\nvarsity basketball team, was on her own class hockey team, and had taken\r\nthird place in the women’s tennis tournament. She was a rosy, rounded,\r\nvigorous-looking girl then. When Mabel Vernon saw her next, she had been\r\nhunger-striking in England and was thin to the point of emaciation.\r\n\r\nI asked Alice Paul herself about her work with the poor in England. She\r\nsaid, looking back on it—and it is apparently always a great effort for\r\nher to remove her mental vision from the present demand—that her main\r\nimpression was of the hopelessness of it all, that there seemed nothing\r\nto do but sweep all that poverty away. The thing that she remembers\r\nespecially now is that they were always burying children.\r\n\r\nThe first great, outstanding fact of Alice Paul’s training is that in\r\nthe English interregnum which divided her American education, she joined\r\nthe Pankhurst forces. In the beginning all her work was of the passive\r\nkind. She attended meetings and ushered. She was about to go home;\r\nindeed she had bought her passage when the Pankhursts asked her to join\r\na deputation to Parliament. This deputation, which consisted of more\r\nthan a hundred women, and was led by Mrs. Pankhurst herself, was\r\narrested at the entrance to Parliament. They were detained in the\r\npolicemen’s billiard room of the Cannon Row Police Station, the only\r\nplace at that station large enough to hold so many women.\r\n\r\nThe second great outstanding fact of Alice Paul’s career in England is\r\nthat she met Lucy Burns.\r\n\r\nLucy Burns was born in Brooklyn. The facts of her education, although\r\nsuperficially not so multitudinous as those of Alice Paul, are even more\r\nimpressive in point of international quality. She was graduated from\r\nPacker Institute in 1899 and from Vassar College in 1902. She studied at\r\nYale University in 1902-03, at the University of Berlin in 1906-08, at\r\nthe University of Bonn in 1908-09. She joined the Woman’s Social and\r\nPolitical Union of London in 1909 and she worked as an organizer in\r\nEdinburgh and the east of Scotland in 1909-12.\r\n\r\nLucy Burns thinks she first met Alice Paul at a Suffrage demonstration.\r\nAlice Paul thinks she first met Lucy Burns in that same policemen’s\r\nbilliard room of the Cannon Row Police Station, London. Both these young\r\nwomen remember their English experiences in flashes and pictures. They\r\nworked too hard and too militantly to keep any written record; and\r\nsuccessive hardships wiped away all traces of their predecessors. At any\r\nrate, Alice Paul says that she spoke to Miss Burns because she noticed\r\nthat she wore a little American flag. Sitting on the billiard table,\r\nthey talked of home. Alice Paul also says that Lucy Burns, a student at\r\nthat time of the University of Bonn in Germany, had come to England for\r\na holiday. She entered the militant movement a few weeks after she\r\nlanded and this was her first demonstration.\r\n\r\nThe women were held for trial, giving bail for their appearance. Alice\r\nPaul had engaged passage home, but she had to cancel it as the trial did\r\nnot occur until after the date of her sailing. The case was appealed in\r\nthe courts and was finally dropped by the government.\r\n\r\nFrom this time on, the paths of the two girls kept crossing. Frequently,\r\nindeed, they worked together. The next time Alice Paul was arrested,\r\nhowever, Lucy Burns was not with her. This was at Norwich. Winston\r\nChurchill, a member of the cabinet, was holding a meeting. Outside,\r\nAlice Paul spoke at a meeting too—a protest against the government’s\r\nstand on Woman Suffrage. On this occasion, she was released without\r\nbeing tried. At the next Suffrage demonstration—at Limehouse in\r\nLondon—both girls assisted. On this occasion, Lloyd George was holding a\r\nmeeting. Miss Paul and Miss Burns were arrested for trying to speak at a\r\nprotest meeting outside, and were sentenced to two weeks in Holloway\r\nJail. They went on a hunger-strike; but were released after five days\r\nand a half.\r\n\r\nAfter they recovered from this experience, Miss Paul and Miss Burns\r\nmotored to Scotland with Mrs. Pankhurst and other English Suffragists,\r\nin order to assist with the Scottish campaign. At Glasgow, the party\r\norganized a demonstration outside of a meeting held by Lord Crewe, a\r\nmember of the cabinet. Arrested, they were released without trial.\r\nProceeding northward, Miss Paul assisted in organizing the Suffrage\r\ncampaign in East Fife, the district of Prime Minister Herbert Asquith.\r\nAt Dundee, Miss Paul and Miss Burns took part in a demonstration outside\r\na meeting held by Winston Churchill. The two American girls and an\r\nEnglish Suffragist were sentenced to ten days in Dundee Prison. After\r\nfour days of hunger-strike, all were released. Each night during their\r\nimprisonment, great crowds of citizens marched round the prison singing\r\nScotch songs as a means of showing their sympathy with the campaign.\r\nUpon their release, the Suffragists were welcomed at a mass-meeting over\r\nwhich the Lord Mayor presided. Thence they went to Edinburgh where they\r\nassisted in organizing a procession and pageant in Princess Street—one\r\nof the most beautiful and famous thoroughfares of the world. The pageant\r\nof the Scotch heroines who had made sacrifices for liberty is still\r\nremembered in Scotland for its beauty. The next job was less agreeable.\r\nThe two American girls were sent to Berwick-on-Tweed to interrupt with a\r\nprotest a meeting of Sir Edward Grey, then Minister of Foreign Affairs.\r\nMiss Paul made the interruption, was arrested, but was released on the\r\nfollowing day without going to trial. Miss Burns was not arrested that\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nNext in Bermondsey, one of the slum districts of London, they waged a\r\nplain, old-fashioned electoral campaign to defeat a candidate. When this\r\nwas over, Miss Paul, in company with a Miss Brown, was sent to make a\r\nSuffrage protest at the Lord Mayor’s Banquet in the Guildhall. They were\r\narrested, of course, and were sentenced to thirty days in Holloway Jail.\r\nThey hunger struck, and were forcibly fed. This experience left its mark\r\non Miss Paul’s health for some time; it was several weeks after her\r\nrelease before she was strong enough to travel. But in January, 1910,\r\nshe sailed for America—and arrived the pale, emaciated creature who so\r\nshocked Mabel Vernon.\r\n\r\nLucy Burns tells an amusing story of Alice Paul’s experiences in\r\nEngland. Lord Crewe was to speak at a meeting at Glasgow, and Alice Paul\r\nwas delegated to represent the Suffragists at that meeting and to heckle\r\nthe speaker. That meant that she must conceal herself in the building,\r\nwhere the meeting was to take place, the night before. The building was\r\na big, high one—St. Andrew’s Hall, the girls remember the name—and it\r\nwas surrounded by a high, formidable iron fence. The night before Lucy\r\nBurns walked with Alice Paul to the Hall and helped her to climb to the\r\ntop of this fence. Then Alice Paul jumped down into the grounds and Lucy\r\nBurns left her there. There was some building going on at this hall and\r\nwith great difficulty Alice Paul climbed the scaffolding to the high\r\nsecond story and settled herself on a roof to spend the night. It rained\r\nall night; and of course she had no protection against the wet. And\r\nafter all this discomfort, when daylight broke, laborers coming to work\r\non a neighboring building observed the strange phenomenon of a woman\r\nlying on a second-story roof. They reported her and she was ignominously\r\nled down and out.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1912, Lucy Burns returned to America. Alice Paul\r\nvisited her in Long Island. For some time now, Alice Paul had been\r\nconsidering the Suffrage situation of the United States in its national\r\naspect. Here, she broached to Lucy Burns her idea of working for a\r\nConstitutional Amendment in Washington—her belief that with six States\r\nenfranchised—with six States that could be used as a lever on\r\nCongress—the time had come when further work in State campaigns was\r\nsheer waste. More even than English conditions, American conditions\r\nfavored the policy of holding the Party in power responsible in regard\r\nto Suffrage. In England, there was no body of women completely\r\nenfranchised. In America there were approximately two million women\r\nvoters who, completely enfranchised, could command a hearing from the\r\npoliticians. She felt that such a campaign in America would be more\r\nproductive of result for still another reason. In pursuing that policy\r\nin England, the Suffragists were often placed in the embarrassing\r\nposition of defeating Suffragists and putting in anti-Suffragists. But\r\nin America, no matter what Party was in power, only Suffrage senators\r\nand representatives could be elected from the Suffrage States. In other\r\nwords, if, in defeating the Party in power they defeated Suffragists—as\r\nwas inevitable in the Suffrage States—other Suffragists as inevitably\r\ntook their places. Moreover, there was no immediate motive urging\r\nsenators and representatives from the Suffrage States—although often\r\nthey were individually helpful—to convert senators and representatives\r\nof their own Party from non-Suffrage States. Were their Party in\r\njeopardy at home, however, that motive was instantly supplied. Also,\r\nAlice Paul thought that it was more dignified of women to ask the vote\r\nof other women than to beg it of men.\r\n\r\nAlice Paul was the first to apply this policy to the Suffrage situation\r\nin the United States. As late as 1917, other Suffrage leaders, as well\r\nas members of Congress, were reiterating that there was no such thing as\r\na Party in power in the United States, that that idea was brought from\r\nEngland by Alice Paul and was not adapted to our American institutions.\r\n\r\nThe two girls concocted a scheme for starting federal work in\r\nWashington. They went with it to the National American Woman Suffrage\r\nAssociation, to Anna Howard Shaw, to Harriot Stanton Blatch, to Mary\r\nWare Dennett. Lucy Burns pictures Alice Paul at that last interview—“a\r\nlittle Quakerish figure, crumpled up in her chair and for the first time\r\nI noticed how beautiful her eyes were.” Finally Alice Paul went to the\r\nConvention of the National American Association at Philadelphia. She\r\ntalked with Jane Addams. Alice Paul suggested that she be allowed to\r\ncome to Washington at her own expense to begin work on Congress for the\r\npassing of a Constitutional Amendment. She agreed to raise the necessary\r\nmoney. Jane Addams brought this suggestion before the Board of the\r\nNational American Woman Suffrage Association, urged its acceptance. It\r\nwas approved. The Board appointed a Committee consisting of Alice Paul,\r\nChairman; Lucy Burns, Vice-chairman; Crystal Eastman. Later in\r\nWashington, Mrs. Lawrence Lewis and Mary Beard joined that Committee.\r\nAlice Paul went first to Philadelphia and collected money for a few\r\ndays. Mrs. Lawrence Lewis, who, Miss Paul says, was one of the first to\r\nsay, “I have always believed that the way to get Suffrage is by a\r\nfederal amendment,” gave her name; gave money; collected money.\r\n\r\nAnd so—all alone—Alice Paul came to Washington.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  III\r\n\r\n                       ALICE PAUL AND LUCY BURNS\r\n\r\n\r\nALICE PAUL is a slender, frail-looking young woman, delicately colored\r\nand delicately made. The head, the neck, the long slim arms, and the\r\nlittle hands look as though they were cut out of alabaster. The dense\r\nshadowy hair, scooping with deeper accessions of shadow into great\r\nwaves, dipping low on her forehead and massing into a great dusky bunch\r\nin her neck, might be carved from bronze. It looks too heavy for her\r\nhead. Her face has a kind of powerful irregularity. Its prevailing\r\nexpression is of a brooding stillness; yet when she smiles, dimples\r\nappear. Her eyes are big and quiet; dark—like moss-agates. When she is\r\nsilent they are almost opaque. When she talks they light up—rather they\r\nglow—in a notable degree of luminosity. Her voice is low; musical; it\r\npulsates with a kind of interrogative plaintiveness. When you ask her a\r\nquestion, there ensues, on her part, a moment of a stillness so\r\nprofound, you can almost hear it. I think I have never seen anybody who\r\ncan keep so still as Alice Paul. But when she answers you, the lucidity\r\nof exposition, the directness of expression! Always she looks you\r\nstraight in the eye, and when she has finished speaking she holds you\r\nwith that luminous glow. Her tiny hands make gestures, almost humorous\r\nin their gentleness and futility, compared with the force of her\r\nremarks.\r\n\r\nIn the endless discussions at Headquarters—discussions that consider\r\nevery subject on earth and change constantly in personnel and point of\r\nview—she is always the most silent. But when at last she speaks, often\r\nthere ensues a pause; she has summed it all up. Superficially she seems\r\ncold, austere, a little remote. But that is only because the fire of her\r\nspirit burns at such a heat that it is still and white. She has the\r\nquiet of the spinning top.\r\n\r\nAs for her mentality ... her capacity for leadership ... her vision....\r\nThere is no difference of opinion in regard to Alice Paul in the Woman’s\r\nParty. With one accord, they say, “She is the Party.” They regard her\r\nwith an admiration which verges on awe. Mentally she walks apart; not\r\nbecause she has any conscious sense of superiority, but because of the\r\nswiftness, amplitude, and completeness with which her mind marches—her\r\nmarvelous powers of concentration and her blazing devotion to the work.\r\n\r\nI think no better description can be given of her than to quote the\r\nexact phrases which her associates use in talking of her. Winifred\r\nMallon speaks of her “burning sincerity.” Helena Hill Weed imputes a\r\n“prescience” to her. Anne Martin says, “She is the heart, brain, and\r\nsoul of the Woman’s Party,” and “Her mind moves with the precision of a\r\nbeautiful machine.” Nina Allender sums her up as “a Napoleon without\r\nself-indulgence.” She said that when at the hearing in 1915, Congressmen\r\ntried to tangle Alice Paul they found it an impossibility; everything in\r\nAlice Paul’s mentality was so clear; there was nothing to tangle. She\r\nadded, “There are no two minds to Alice Paul.” “My mother describes\r\nher,” she concluded, “as a flame undyingly burning.”\r\n\r\nThis is Maud Younger’s tribute:\r\n\r\n\r\n    She has in the first place a devotion to the cause which is\r\n    absolutely self-sacrificing. She has an indomitable will. She\r\n    recognizes no obstacles. She has a clear, penetrating, analytic mind\r\n    which cleaves straight to the heart of things. In examining a\r\n    situation, she always bares the main fact; she sees all the forces\r\n    which make for change in that situation. She is a genius for\r\n    organization, both in the mass and in detail. She understands\r\n    perfectly, in achieving the big object, the cumulative effect of\r\n    multitudes of small actions and small services. She makes use of all\r\n    material, whether human or otherwise, that comes along. Her work has\r\n    perpetual growth; it never stagnates; it is always branching out.\r\n    She is never hampered or cluttered. She is free of the past. Her\r\n    inventiveness and resourcefulness are endless. She believes\r\n    absolutely in open diplomacy. She believes that everything should be\r\n    told; our main argument with her was in regard to the necessity for\r\n    secrecy in special cases. She is almost without suspicion; and\r\n    sometimes with a too-great tendency towards kind judgment in the\r\n    case of the individual. It seems incredible that with all these\r\n    purely intellectual gifts, she should possess an acute appreciation\r\n    of beauty; a gift for pageantry; an amazing sense of humor.\r\n\r\n\r\nLucy Burns says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    When Alice Paul spoke to me about the federal work, I knew that she\r\n    had an extraordinary mind, extraordinary courage and remarkable\r\n    executive ability. But I felt she had two disabilities—ill-health\r\n    and a lack of knowledge of human nature. I was wrong in both. I was\r\n    staggered by her speed and industry and the way she could raise\r\n    money. Her great assets, I should say, are her power, with a single\r\n    leap of the imagination, to make plans on a national scale; and a\r\n    supplementary power to see that done down to the last postage stamp.\r\n    But because she can do all this, people let her do it—often she has\r\n    to carry her own plans out down to the very last postage stamp. She\r\n    used all kinds of people; she tested them through results. She is\r\n    exceedingly charitable in her judgments of people and patient. She\r\n    assigned one inept person to five different kinds of work before she\r\n    gave her up. Her abruptness lost some workers, but not the finer\r\n    spirits. The very absence of anything like personal appeal seemed to\r\n    help her.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LUCY BURNS AT THE HEAD OF THE “PRISON SPECIALISTS.” These\r\nWomen, All of Whom Served Terms in Jail, Are Wearing a Reproduction of\r\nTheir Prison Garb. Photo Copr. Harris and Ewing, Washington, D. C.]\r\n\r\n\r\nLucy Burns is as different a type from Alice Paul as one could imagine.\r\nShe is tall—or at least she seems tall; rounded and muscular; a\r\nsplendidly vigorous physical specimen. If Alice Paul looks as though she\r\nwere a Tanagra carved from alabaster, Lucy Burns seems like a figure,\r\nheroically sculptured, from marble. She is blue-eyed and\r\nfresh-complexioned; dimpled; and her head is burdened, even as Alice\r\nPaul’s, by an enormous weight of hair. Lucy Burn’s hair is a brilliant\r\nred; and even as she flashes, it flashes. It is full of sparkle. She is\r\na woman of twofold ability. She speaks and writes with equal eloquence\r\nand elegance. Her speeches before Suffrage bodies, her editorials in the\r\n_Suffragist_ are models of clearness; conciseness; of accumulative force\r\nof expression. Mentally and emotionally, she is quick and warm. Her\r\nconvictions are all vigorous and I do not think Lucy Burns would\r\nhesitate for a moment to suffer torture, to die, for them. She has\r\nintellectuality of a high order; but she overruns with a winning\r\nIrishness which supplements that intellectuality with grace and charm; a\r\nsocial mobility of extreme sensitiveness and swiftness. In those early\r\ndays in Washington, with all her uncompromising militantism, Lucy Burns\r\nwas the diplomat of the pair; the tactful, placating force.\r\n\r\nI asked a member of the Woman’s Party who had watched the work from the\r\nbeginning what was the difference between the two women. She answered,\r\n“They are both political-minded. They seemed in those early days to have\r\none spirit and one brain. Both saw the situation exactly as it was, but\r\nthey went at the problem with different methods. Alice Paul had a more\r\nacute sense of justice, Lucy Burns, a more bitter sense of injustice.\r\nLucy Burns would become angry because the President or the people did\r\nnot do this or that. Alice Paul never expected anything of them.”\r\n\r\nBoth these women had the highest kind of courage. Lucy Burns—although\r\nshe admits that at Occoquan Workhouse, she suffered from nameless\r\nterrors—has a mental poise that is almost unsusceptible to fear. Alice\r\nPaul—although she can with perfect composure endure arrest,\r\nimprisonment, hunger-striking—acknowledges timidities. She does not like\r\nto listen to horrors of any description, especially ghost-stories. They\r\nsay though that, in the movies, she always particularly enjoyed pirates.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   IV\r\n\r\n                      F STREET AND THE EARLY DAYS\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN Alice Paul arrived in Washington in December, 1912, she found a\r\ndiscouraging state of things. She had been given the address of\r\nHeadquarters, but Headquarters had vanished. She had been given a list\r\nof people to whom she could turn for help, but most of them had died or\r\nmoved away. At that time, Mrs. William Kent, who was subsequently to\r\nbecome one of her constant and able assistants, was Chairman of the\r\nCongressional Committee of the National American Woman Suffrage\r\nAssociation. Two years before, when her husband was elected to Congress,\r\nMrs. Kent came to Washington. When she was asked to become Chairman of\r\nthis Committee she was told that it would entail no work. She must\r\nmerely see that the bill was introduced and arrange hearings before the\r\ntwo committees. There was no thought of putting the Amendment through,\r\nand no lobbying for it. The National Association allowed Mrs. Kent ten\r\ndollars. At the end of the year she returned change. There were a few\r\nSuffrage clubs in Washington, but their activity was merely social.\r\nAlice Paul saw that the work had to be started from the very beginning.\r\nFirst of all they had to have Headquarters. She hired a little basement\r\nroom at 1420 F Street. At a formal opening on January 2, 1913, Mrs.\r\nWilliam Kent, presiding, introduced Alice Paul as her successor; and a\r\nplan for federal work was laid before the Suffragists of the District of\r\nColumbia. Of course no one at the meeting guessed that she was present\r\nat a historic occasion.\r\n\r\nAlice Paul began work at once. Nina Allender says that one Sunday a\r\nstranger called. She was wearing “a slim dress and a little purple hat\r\nand she was no bigger,” Mrs. Allender held up her forefinger, “than\r\n_that_.” The call was brief and it was unaccompanied by any of the small\r\ntalk or the persiflage which distinguishes most social occasions. But\r\nwhen the door closed, a few moments later, mother and daughter looked at\r\neach other in amazement. Mrs. Evans had promised to contribute to\r\nSuffrage a sum of money monthly. Mrs. Allender had promised to\r\ncontribute to Suffrage a sum of money monthly. Mrs. Evans had agreed to\r\ndo a certain amount of work monthly. Mrs. Allender had agreed to do a\r\ncertain amount of work monthly. Their amazement arose partly from the\r\nfact that they had not been begged, urged, or argued with—they had\r\nsimply been asked; and partly from the fact that, before the arrival of\r\nthis slim little stranger, they had no more idea of contributing so much\r\nmoney or work than of flying. But they agreed to it the instant she\r\nrequested it of them.\r\n\r\nThis is a perfect example of the way Alice Paul works. There may be\r\ntimes when she urges, even begs; but they appear to be rare. She often\r\nforgets to thank you when you say yes; for she has apparently assumed\r\nthat you will say yes. She does not argue with you when you say no—but\r\nyou rarely say no. She has only to ask apparently. Perhaps it is part\r\nthe terseness with which she puts her request. Perhaps it is part her\r\nsimple acceptance of the fact that you are not going to refuse. Perhaps\r\nit is her expectation that you will understand that she is not asking\r\nfor herself but for Suffrage. Perhaps it is the Quaker integrity which\r\nshines through every statement. Perhaps it is the intensity of devotion\r\nwhich blazes back of the gentleness of her personality and the\r\ninflexibility of purpose which gives that gentleness power. At any rate,\r\nit is very difficult to refuse Alice Paul.\r\n\r\nA member of the Woman’s Party, meeting her for the first time in New\r\nYork and riding for a short distance in a taxicab with her, says that\r\nAlice Paul turned to her as soon as they were alone:\r\n\r\n“Will you give a thousand dollars to the Woman’s Party?”\r\n\r\n“No, I haven’t that amount to give.”\r\n\r\n“Will you give one hundred dollars?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Will you give twenty-five dollars?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Will you——”\r\n\r\n“I’ll give five dollars.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Gilson Gardner says that one day, in the midst of the final\r\npreparations for the procession of March 3, she came to Headquarters.\r\nAlice Paul, it was apparent, was in a state of considerable\r\nperturbation. At the sight of Mrs. Gardner she said, “There’s Mrs.\r\nGardner! She’ll attend to it.” She went on to explain. “The trappings\r\nfor the horses have been ruined. Will you order some more? They must be\r\ndelivered tomorrow night.” Mrs. Gardner says that she had no more idea\r\nhow to order a trapping than a suspension bridge, but—magic-ed as always\r\nby Alice Paul’s personality—she emitted a terrified “Yes,” and started\r\nout. She walked round and round the block a dozen times, reviewing her\r\nproblem, and casting about her looks of an appalled desperation.\r\nSuddenly she espied a little tailor shop, and in it, at work, a little\r\ntailor. She approached and confided her problem to him. Mrs. Gardner\r\nkept shop while he went to Headquarters and got the measurements. He\r\ndelivered the trappings on time.\r\n\r\nLater in the history of the Woman’s Party, Margery Ross came to\r\nWashington to spend the winter with a cousin.\r\n\r\nShe was young and pretty. She established herself there and began to\r\nenjoy herself. She was a Suffragist. One day, out of a clear sky, Alice\r\nPaul said: “Miss Ross, will you go to Wyoming on Saturday, and organize\r\na State Convention there within three weeks?” “Why, Miss Paul,” the girl\r\nfaltered, “I _can’t_. My plans are all made for the winter. I’ve only\r\njust got here.” Nevertheless, in a few days, Miss Ross started for\r\nWyoming. There were only eight members of the Congressional Union in\r\nthat State, and yet three weeks later she had achieved a State\r\nConvention with one hundred and twenty delegates.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, however, the story which best illustrates Miss Paul’s power to\r\nmake people work is one of Nina Allender’s. One must remember that Mrs.\r\nAllender is an artist. One day Alice Paul telephoned her to ask her if\r\nshe would go the next day to Ohio to campaign for the Woman’s Party.\r\nMrs. Allender, who had no more expectation of going to Ohio than to the\r\nmoon, replied: “I’m sorry. It’s impossible. You see, we have just moved.\r\nThe place is being papered and painted, and I’ve got to select the\r\nwallpaper.” “Oh, that’s all right,” Alice Paul suggested. “I’ll send a\r\ngirl right up there. _She’ll pick your paper for you and see that it’s\r\nput on._” In the end, of course, Mrs. Allender chose her own paper. But\r\nalthough she did not go to Ohio the next day, she went within a week.\r\n\r\nWhen Alice Paul asked Maud Younger to deliver the memorial address on\r\nInez Milholland, Miss Younger was at first staggered by the idea. “I\r\ncan’t,” she said. “I don’t know how to do it.”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” directed Alice Paul in a _dégagé_ way, “_just write something like\r\nLincoln’s Gettysburg address_.”\r\n\r\nThe first Headquarters consisted of one long basement room, partitioned\r\nat the back into three small rooms of which two were storerooms, and one\r\nMiss Paul’s office. This opened into a court. Later when the\r\n_Suffragist_ was published, they had rooms upstairs; sometimes one,\r\nsometimes more, according to their funds. By the first anniversary, they\r\nhad expanded to ten rooms. Later still, they had two whole floors.\r\n\r\nAlmost all the work was done by volunteers. All kinds of people worked\r\nfor them. Comparatively idle women of the moneyed class gave up\r\nmatinées, teas, and other social occasions; stenographers, who worked\r\nall day long, labored until midnight. Anybody who dropped into\r\nHeadquarters for any purpose was put to work. Once a distinguished\r\nlawyer from a western city called on business with Alice Paul.\r\n\r\n“Would you mind addressing a few envelopes?” asked Alice Paul when the\r\nbusiness was concluded. The distinguished lawyer, whose own office was\r\nof course manned by a small army of stenographers, smiled; but he took\r\noff his coat and went to work.\r\n\r\nAlice Paul’s swift, decisive leadership was accepted, unquestioningly.\r\nHer word was immutable. One day an elderly woman was observed at a\r\ntypewriter, painfully picking at it with a stiff forefinger. It was\r\nobvious that with a great expenditure of time and energy, she was\r\naccomplishing nothing.\r\n\r\n“Why are you doing that?” somebody asked curiously.\r\n\r\n“Because Alice Paul told me to,” was the plaintive answer.\r\n\r\nMost of the work was done in the big front room. The confusion of going\r\nand coming of the volunteer workers; the noise of conflicting activity;\r\nconversation; telephones; made concentrated thinking almost impossible.\r\nThe policeman on the beat said that a light burned in Headquarters all\r\nnight long. That was true. Alice Paul and Lucy Burns used to work far\r\ninto the morning because then, alone, were they assured of quiet. There\r\nwere times though when Alice Paul worked all day, all night and sitting\r\nup in bed, into the next morning. She never lost time. Later when she\r\npicketed the White House, she used to take a stenographer with her and\r\ndictate while on picket duty.\r\n\r\nVolunteer work is of course not always to be depended upon. It is\r\neccentric and follows its own laws. There would be periods when\r\nHeadquarters would be flooded with help. There came intervals when it\r\nwas almost empty. Sara Grogan, herself a devoted adherent, tells how in\r\nthis case, she used to go out on the streets and ask strangers to help.\r\nVolunteer workers—if they were housekeepers or the mothers of\r\nfamilies—learned, on their busy days, to give F Street a wide berth. As\r\nthey had no time to give and as it was impossible to say no to Alice\r\nPaul, the streets about Headquarters were as closed to them as the\r\nstreets of his creditors to Dick Swiveller. It was perhaps this\r\nexperience which taught Alice Paul what later became one of her chief\r\nassets—her power to put to use every bit of human material that came her\r\nway; which developed in her that charitable willingness, when this human\r\nmaterial failed in one direction, to try it in another; and another; and\r\nanother. Rarely did she reject any offer of help, no matter how\r\nuntrained or seemingly untrainable it was. I asked Mabel Vernon how she\r\ngot so much work—and such splendid work of all kinds—out of amateurs.\r\nShe answered, “She believed we could do it and so she made us believe\r\nit.”\r\n\r\nIn those days, Alice Paul herself was like one driven by a fury of\r\nspeed. She was a human dynamo. She made everybody else work as hard as\r\npossible, but she drove—although she did drive—nobody so hard as\r\nherself. Winifred Mallon said, “I worked with Alice Paul for three\r\nmonths before I saw her with her hat off. I was perfectly astonished, I\r\nremember, at that mass of hair. I had never suspected its existence.”\r\nFor a long time, Alice Paul deliberately lived in a cold room, so that\r\nshe could not be tempted to sit up late to read. It was more than a year\r\nbefore she visited the book-shop opened by a friend because, she said,\r\n“I should be tempted to buy so many books there.” Anne Martin says that\r\nshe believes Alice Paul made a vow not to think or to read anything that\r\nwas not connected with Suffrage until the Amendment was passed. There\r\nwas certainly no evidence of her reading anything else. They make the\r\nhumorous observation at Headquarters now that the instant the Amendment\r\nhad passed both Houses, Alice Paul began to permit herself the luxury of\r\none mental relaxation—the reading of detective stories. But in those\r\nearly days she worked all the time and she worked at everything.\r\nSomebody said to Lucy Burns, “She asks nothing of us that she doesn’t do\r\nherself,” and Lucy Burns answered dryly, “Yes, she’s annoyingly\r\nversatile.”\r\n\r\nNot only did Alice Paul ask you to work but after you had agreed to it,\r\nshe kept after you. “She ‘nagged’ us”-they say humorously at\r\nHeadquarters. Once, just before leaving for Chicago, Alice Paul\r\nappointed a certain young person chairman of a certain committee, with\r\npower to select chairmen of ten other committees to arrange for a\r\ndemonstration when the Suffrage Special returned. This was four weeks\r\noff and yet in three days from Chicago came a telegram: “Wire me\r\nimmediately the names of your chairmen!”\r\n\r\nBut just as Alice Paul never thanked herself for what she was doing, it\r\nnever occurred to her to thank anybody else. And perhaps she had an\r\ninnate conviction that it was egregious personally to thank people for\r\ndevotion to a cause. However that did not always work out in practice,\r\nnaturally.\r\n\r\nOnce a woman, a volunteer, who had worked all the morning reported to\r\nAlice Paul at noon. She retailed what she had done. Alice Paul made no\r\ncomment whatever, but asked her immediately if she would go downtown for\r\nher. The woman refused; went away and did not come back. Alice Paul\r\nasked a friend for an explanation of her absence. “She is offended,” her\r\nfriend explained. “You did not thank her for what she did.” “But,”\r\nexclaimed Alice Paul, “she did not do it for me. She did it for\r\nSuffrage. I thought she would be delighted to do it for Suffrage.” After\r\nthat, however, Alice Paul tried very hard to remember to thank\r\neverybody. Once a party member said to her, as she was leaving\r\nHeadquarters, “I have a taxi here, Miss Paul—can’t I take you anywhere?”\r\n“No,” Alice Paul answered abruptly. She was halfway down the stairs when\r\nshe seemed to remember something. Instantly she turned back and said,\r\n“Thank you!” Another time, somebody else announced that she was offended\r\nbecause Alice Paul had not thanked her, and was going to leave. A friend\r\nwent to Alice Paul.\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Blank is leaving us. I am afraid you have offended her.”\r\n\r\n“Where is she?” Alice Paul demanded, “I will apologize at once.”\r\n\r\n“For what?” the friend inquired.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know,” Alice Paul answered, “_anything_!”\r\n\r\nLike Roosevelt, Alice Paul had a remarkable news sense. She was the joy\r\nof newspaper men. Ninety per cent of the Woman’s Party bulletins got\r\npublicity as against about twenty per cent of others. A New Orleans\r\neditor said they were the best publicity organization in the country.\r\nGilson Gardner compares her to a Belasco, staging the scene admirably\r\nbut, herself, always in the background.\r\n\r\nLater, when the first stress was over, her companions spoke of the joy\r\nof work with her. They marveled at that creative quality which made her\r\nput over her demonstrations on so enormous a scale and the beauty with\r\nwhich she inundated them.\r\n\r\nMaud Younger tells of going with her one night to the Capitol steps,\r\nwhen she painted imaginatively, on the scene which lay outstretched\r\nbefore her, the great demonstration which she was planning: wide areas\r\nof static color here, long lines of pulsating color there, laid on in\r\ngreat splashes and welts, like a painter of the modern school. Above\r\nall, her companions took a fearful joy in the serene way in which she\r\nbrushed aside red tape, ignored rules. She would decide on some\r\nunexpected, daring bit of pioneer demonstration. Her companions would\r\nreport to her regarding restrictions. “What an absurd rule,” she would\r\nremark, and then proceed calmly to ignore it. “Oh, Miss Paul, we _can’t_\r\ndo that!” was the commonest exclamation with which the fellow workers\r\ngreeted her plans. But always they did do it because she convinced them\r\nthat it could be done. After the death of Inez Milholland, Alice Paul\r\ndecided to hold a memorial service in Statuary Hall at the Capitol.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Miss Paul, we can’t do that! Memorial services are held there only\r\nfor those whose statues are in the Hall.” But in the end she did it.\r\nWhen her Committee spoke about it to the officials who have Statuary\r\nHall in charge they said, “One thing we cannot permit. You cannot go up\r\ninto the gallery because the doors open from that gallery into rooms\r\ncontaining old and valued books and those books might be stolen.” The\r\npolice said, “No, you must not hang curtains over those openings in case\r\na Senator wants to pass through.” Later the police themselves were\r\nhelping Alice Paul to place the purple, white, and gold pennants about\r\nthe gallery; they themselves were piling around their standards, in\r\norder to hold them straight, those same old and valued books; they\r\nthemselves were standing on stepladders to help her hang curtains before\r\nthose unsealable openings.\r\n\r\nWhen the Suffrage Special returned, Alice Paul decided to hold a\r\nwelcoming banquet in the dining-room of the beautiful new Washington\r\nrailroad station. She sent somebody to ask this privilege of the\r\nauthorities. At first, of course, they said, no, but in the end, of\r\ncourse, they said, yes. The Woman’s Party hired a band to help in the\r\nwelcome. Alice Paul observed that the man who played the horn was so\r\ntall that he obscured an important detail in the decoration. She asked\r\nhim to stand in another part of the band group. Of course he answered\r\nthat that was impossible, that the horn always stood where he was\r\nstanding, but in the end, of course, he stood where Alice Paul told him\r\nto stand.\r\n\r\nLate in the history of the Woman’s Party, somebody discovered that Alice\r\nPaul had never seen an anti-Suffragist. At a legislative hearing during\r\nratification they pointed out one to her—a beautiful one. “She looks\r\nlike a Botticelli,” Alice Paul said—and gazed admiringly at her for the\r\nrest of the hearing.\r\n\r\nHer companions marveled, I reiterate, at Alice Paul’s creative power.\r\nThat did not manifest itself in demonstrations alone. Her policy had\r\ncreative quality. It had a wide sweep. It moved on wings and with\r\naccumulating force and speed. Her work in Washington started slowly,\r\nthough with sureness of attack, but all the time it heightened and\r\ndeepened. From 1913 to 1919 it never faltered. Sometimes changes in\r\noutside affairs made changes in her self-evolved plan, but they never\r\nstopped it, never even slowed it. From the beginning she saw her\r\nobjective clearly; and always she made for it. Activities that may often\r\nhave seemed to the callow-minded but the futile militancy of a group of\r\nfanatics were part of a perfectly co-ordinated plan. Moreover, she had\r\nalways reserve ideas and always a buried ace. Sapient members of the\r\nParty—those who were close to her—believe that she used only a part of\r\nan enormous scheme; that she was prepared far into the future and for\r\nany possible contingency. They wonder sometimes how far that creative\r\nimpulse reached ... what form it would later ... and later ... and later\r\nhave taken. Yet she proceeded slowly, giving every new form of agitation\r\nits chance; prudent always of her reserves. The instant one kind of\r\ndemonstration exhausted its usefulness, she moved to the next. She\r\nwasted no time on side issues, on petty hostilities, on rivalries with\r\nother organizations.\r\n\r\nBut the quality that, above all, informed her other qualities, the\r\nquality that she first of all brought to the Suffrage situation, the\r\nquality that made her associates regard her with a kind of awe, was her\r\npolitical-mindedness, and political-mindedness was not at all uncommon\r\nin the Woman’s Party. It was, perhaps, its main asset, although\r\ninitiative and efficiency, speed, and courage of the most daring order\r\nmarked it. But Alice Paul’s political-mindedness had quality as well as\r\nquantity. When Hughes was made the Republican nominee for the 1916\r\nelection, Alice Paul asked him to declare for National Suffrage. He was\r\nexceedingly dubious. It is obvious that, in asking favors of a\r\npolitician, it is necessary to prove to him that action on his part will\r\nnot hurt him in the matter of votes and may help him. On this point,\r\nAlice Paul said in effect:\r\n\r\n“Your Party consists of two factions, the old, stand-pat Republicans and\r\nthe Progressives. Now, if you put a Suffrage plank in your platform, you\r\nwill not alienate the Progressives, because the Progressives have a\r\nSuffrage plank, and the old stand-pat Republicans will not vote for a\r\nDemocrat no matter what you put in your platform.”\r\n\r\nWhen in the same election campaign Hughes went West, and the West turned\r\nto Wilson, it became evident, however much the Woman’s Party diminished\r\nthe prestige of Wilson, it could not defeat him. Numerous advisers\r\nsuggested to Alice Paul to withdraw her speakers from the campaign.\r\n\r\nAlice Paul answered, “_No; if we withdraw our speakers from the\r\ncampaign, we withdraw the issue from the campaign._ The main thing is to\r\nmake the Suffrage Amendment a national issue that the Democrats will not\r\nwant to meet in another campaign.”\r\n\r\nAfter the election, somebody said to her, “The people of the United\r\nStates generally think you made a great mistake in fighting Wilson. They\r\nthink your campaign a failure.” Alice Paul answered, “In this case, it\r\nis not important what the people think _but what the Democratic leaders\r\nknow_.”\r\n\r\nThe most magical thing about Alice Paul’s political-mindedness was,\r\nhowever, a quality which is almost indescribable. Perhaps it should be\r\nsymbolized by some term of the fourth dimension—although Helena Hill\r\nWeed’s happy word “prescience” comes near to describing it. Maud Younger\r\ngives an extraordinary example of this. She says again and again,\r\nlobbyists would come back from the Capitol with the news of some\r\nunexpected manœuver which perplexed or even blocked them. Congressmen,\r\nthemselves, would be puzzled over the situation. Again and again, she\r\nhas seen Alice Paul walk to the window, stand there, head bent,\r\nthinking. Then, suddenly she would come back. She had seen behind the\r\nveil of conflicting and seemingly untranslatable testimony. She had, in\r\nMaud Younger’s own words, cloven “straight to the heart of things.”\r\nOften her lobbyists had the experience of explaining to baffled members\r\nof Committees in Congress the concealed tactics of their own Committee.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was small wonder that they were so busy at Headquarters during those\r\nfirst months. They were preparing for a monster demonstration in the\r\nshape of a procession which was to occur on March 3, 1913, on the eve of\r\nPresident Wilson’s first inauguration. That procession, which was really\r\na thing of great beauty, brought Suffrage into prominence in a way the\r\nSuffragists had not for an instant anticipated. About eight thousand\r\nwomen took part. The procession started from the Capitol, marched up\r\nPennsylvania Avenue past the White House and ended in a mass-meeting at\r\nthe Hall of the Daughters of the American Revolution. Although a permit\r\nhad been issued for the procession, and though this carried with it the\r\nright to the street, the police failed to protect the marchers as had\r\nbeen rumored they would. The end of the Avenue was almost impassable to\r\nthe parade. A huge crowd, drawn from all over the country, had appeared\r\nin Washington for the Inauguration festivities. They chose to act in the\r\nmost rowdy manner possible and many of the police chose to seem\r\noblivious of what they were doing. Disgraceful episodes occurred.\r\nSecretary of War Stimson had finally to send for troops from Fort Meyer.\r\nThere was an investigation of the action of the police by a Committee of\r\nthe Senate. The official report is a thick book containing testimony\r\nthat will shock any fine-minded American citizen. Ultimately, the Chief\r\nof Police for the District of Columbia was removed.\r\n\r\nThe investigation, however, kept the Suffrage procession in the minds of\r\nthe public for many weeks. It almost over-shadowed the Inauguration\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn this occasion, the banner—in a slightly modified form to be\r\nafterwards always known as the Great Demand banner—was carried for the\r\nfirst time. This banner marched peremptorily through the history of the\r\nWoman’s Party until the Suffrage Amendment was passed. It said:\r\n\r\n           WE DEMAND AN AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION OF THE\r\n         UNITED STATES ENFRANCHISING THE WOMEN OF THE COUNTRY.\r\n\r\nOn March 3 there arrived in Washington a man who was that day a simple\r\ncitizen of the United States. The next day he was to become the\r\nPresident of the United States. As Woodrow Wilson drove from the station\r\nthrough the empty streets to his hotel, he asked, “Where are the\r\npeople?”\r\n\r\nThe answer was, “Over on the Avenue watching the Suffrage Parade.”\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   V\r\n\r\n                 MAKING THE FEDERAL AMENDMENT AN ISSUE\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE first great demonstration of the Congressional Committee—the\r\nprocession of March 3—had been designed to attract the eye of the\r\ncountry to the Suffragists. It succeeded beyond their wildest hopes.\r\nThereafter it became a part of the policy of the Congressional\r\nCommittee—later, the Congressional Union, and later still, the National\r\nWoman’s Party—to keep the people watching the Suffragists. The main work\r\nof the Congressional Committee, however, focussed directly on Congress,\r\nas of course Congress alone could pass a Constitutional Amendment. They\r\nappealed to Congress constantly, by different methods, and through\r\ndifferent avenues. They appealed to Congress through the President of\r\nthe United States, through political leaders, through constituents. It\r\nis one way of describing their system to say that they worked on\r\nCongress by a series of electric shocks delivered to it downwards from\r\nthe President, and by a constant succession of waves delivered upwards\r\nthrough the people. This pressure never ceased for a moment. It\r\naccumulated in power as the six years of this work went on.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen President Wilson arrived in Washington for his inauguration, the\r\nfirst thing brought to his notice was Suffrage agitation. The\r\nCongressional Committee thereafter kept Suffrage constantly before him.\r\nIf not actually opposed to Suffrage in 1913, Woodrow Wilson had every\r\nappearance of opposition; certainly he was utterly indifferent to it.\r\nBut Alice Paul believed that he was amenable to education on the\r\nsubject, and she proceeded to educate him. Her theory proved to be true,\r\nbut the process took longer than she had anticipated. Her methods of\r\ncourse aroused storms of criticism; but in the end they triumphed. The\r\nPresident’s action during the six years’ siege was the attitude of all\r\npoliticians. That is to say, for a long time he made general statements\r\nof a vaguely encouraging nature to the Suffragists, but for a long time\r\nhe actually did nothing. Every accepted method of convincing him of the\r\njustice of the cause was tried. Deputation after deputation waited on\r\nhim and stated their case. Then he began to move. He came out for Woman\r\nSuffrage as a principle; he voted for it in New Jersey but he still\r\nbelieved that the enfranchisement of woman must come by States. In 1917,\r\nhis position, except for these minor admissions, was exactly that of\r\n1913. As far as the Suffrage Amendment was concerned, he had not budged\r\nan inch. The Woman’s Party then tried desperate remedies and afterward\r\nmore and more desperate remedies. These always produced results—towards\r\nthe end, _immediate_ results. But at the beginning of this period, the\r\nSuffragists found that the instant they relaxed, the President relaxed;\r\nhis attention departed from Suffrage. This always happened. Then the\r\nCongressional Committee began to exert a little more pressure, and the\r\nPresident’s attention came back to Suffrage. In the long attacking\r\nprocess to which Alice Paul subjected him, she put him in untenable\r\nposition after untenable position. He moved from each one of them by\r\nsome new concession. In the end, he himself procured the last vote\r\nnecessary to pass the Amendment in the Senate.\r\n\r\nAlice Paul admires Woodrow Wilson profoundly. She admires his powers of\r\nleadership; his ideals; his persistence; his steadfastness; his\r\nresolution. “He is a man,” she says, “who considers one thing at a time.\r\nSuffrage was not in his thought at all until we, ourselves, injected it\r\nthere. And it was not in the center of his thought until the picketing\r\nwas well along.” She believed always that, when the President was made\r\nto think that he must act in regard to Suffrage, he would put it\r\nthrough.\r\n\r\nImmediately after his inauguration, President Wilson announced that a\r\nspecial session of Congress would be called on April 7. At once the\r\nCongressional Committee decided to bring to his attention the fact that\r\nthere was no subject which more urgently demanded treatment in this\r\nsession than Woman Suffrage. Three deputations were therefore organized\r\nto ask him to recommend the Federal Amendment in the message by which he\r\nshould convene this special session. These deputations—and all\r\nsubsequent ones—were organized by Alice Paul.\r\n\r\nThe first deputation waited on President Wilson on March 17. This\r\ndeputation consisting of four women was led by Alice Paul herself.\r\nAlthough individual Suffragists had interviewed previous presidents,\r\nthis was the first deputation which had ever appeared with a request for\r\naction before a President of the United States. President Wilson’s reply\r\nto their remarks was that the subject would receive his most careful\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nThe episode was one of the most amusing of the early history of the\r\nCongressional Committee. The President received the deputation in the\r\nWhite House offices. When they entered, they found four chairs arranged\r\nin a row with one in front of them, like a class about to be addressed\r\nby a teacher. The atmosphere was so tense that all the women felt it and\r\nwere frightened. Alice Paul spoke first and said that women wanted\r\nSuffrage considered by Congress at once, as the most important issue\r\nbefore the country. All spoke in turn. One woman was so terrified that\r\nshe petrified when her turn came. “Don’t be nervous,” the President\r\nreassured her and she finally proceeded. To this first group the\r\nPresident made the statement that so astounded Suffragists all over the\r\ncountry—that Suffrage had never been brought to his attention, that the\r\nmatter was entirely new. He added that he did not know his position and\r\nwould like all information possible on the subject.\r\n\r\nThe Congressional Committee gave him time to give the subject this\r\ncareful attention, and then a second deputation waited on the President\r\non March 28 to furnish him with the information he lacked. This\r\ndeputation was led by Elsie Hill, and it represented the College Equal\r\nSuffrage League. The President replied to their remarks that this\r\nsession of Congress would be so occupied with the tariff and the\r\ncurrency that the Suffrage measure could not be considered.\r\n\r\nA third deputation waited on the President on March 31. It was led by\r\nDr. Cora Smith King, and it was composed of influential members of the\r\nNational Council of Women Voters. This delegation told the President\r\nthat the women voters, who numbered approximately two million, were much\r\ninterested in the proposed Suffrage Amendment. They also asked him to\r\nrecommend it in his message. His reply to them was the same as to the\r\ncollege women: that this special session would be so occupied with the\r\ntariff and currency that the Suffrage measure could not be considered.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the Congressional Committee had notified Suffragists\r\nall over the United States that a Suffrage Amendment would be introduced\r\nin this special session of Congress; asking them to urge the President\r\nto indorse Suffrage in his forthcoming message; and to request their\r\nRepresentative in Congress to support Suffrage when it was introduced.\r\nLetters poured into Washington from the remotest corners of the country.\r\n\r\nThis was the beginning of that intimacy which the Congressional\r\nCommittee—afterwards the Congressional Union, afterwards the National\r\nWoman’s Party—established with its sympathizers and members all over the\r\ncountry. In the nature of things—the political situation being\r\nchangeable, and demanding always subtle, delicate, and often swift and\r\ndecisive handling—the actual work at Washington had to be planned and\r\nexecuted by a limited number. But those few must be able, forceful, and\r\nswiftly executive spirits. Their adherents all over the country were\r\nhowever kept as closely and constantly as possible in touch with that\r\nchanging situation.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the Congressional Committee did all possible preliminary\r\nwork with the incoming members of this Congress. The result on the\r\nProgressive members was encouraging. Although there was a Woman Suffrage\r\nCommittee in the Senate, there was none in the House. Thitherto, the\r\nSuffrage question had been sent to the Judiciary Committee, the\r\ngraveyard of the House. As a result of the work of the Congressional\r\nCommittee, the Progressive Caucus, which met before the new Congress\r\nassembled, gave its unqualified indorsement to the proposal to create a\r\nWoman Suffrage Committee in the House. The Congressional Committee\r\ncanvassed the Democratic members of the House and urged them to take\r\nsimilar action. The Democratic Caucus, however, entirely ignored the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nHaving brought Suffrage to the attention of the new President by the\r\nmonster procession of March 3, the Congressional Committee proceeded to\r\nbring it to the attention of the new Congress by a second great\r\ndemonstration. This was in support of the Federal Amendment, and it took\r\nplace on the opening day of the special session of the Sixty-third\r\nCongress, April 7, 1913. Delegates from each of the 435 Congressional\r\ndistricts in the United States assembled at Washington, bringing\r\npetitions from the men and women of their districts, asking for the\r\npassing of the Amendment. After the mass-meeting, the delegates marched,\r\neach behind her State banner, to the doors of Congress. The procession\r\nwas greeted at the steps of the Capitol by a group of Congressmen. One\r\nof them welcomed the petitioners in a speech pledging his support to\r\ntheir cause. They then led the delegation into the Rotunda, where a long\r\nreceiving line of members of Congress repeated his welcome. The\r\nSuffragists took places which had been set aside for them in the\r\ngalleries of the Senate and the House and watched the presentation of\r\nthe petitions.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the petitions were presented, Representative Mondell\r\n(Republican) of Wyoming, and Senator Chamberlain (Democrat) of Oregon\r\nintroduced the Suffrage Amendment. In the Senate this resolution was\r\nreferred to the Woman’s Suffrage Committee, and in the House to the\r\nJudiciary Committee. Named, as is customary, after those who introduced\r\nit, the measure was known first as the Chamberlain-Mondell Amendment,\r\nand later as the Bristow-Mondell Amendment. It was in reality the famous\r\nSusan B. Anthony Amendment—first introduced into Congress in 1878 by\r\nSenator Sargent of California—exactly as she drew it up. The Anthony\r\nAmendment runs as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Section 1. The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall\r\n    not be denied or abridged by any State on account of sex.\r\n\r\n    Section 2. Congress shall have power by appropriate legislation to\r\n    enforce the provisions of this article.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn that same day—April 7, 1913—resolutions were introduced in the House\r\nto create a Woman Suffrage Committee similar to that in the Senate. This\r\nwas only a tiny gain; for that Committee was not actually created until\r\nSeptember, 1917. But a little later occurred what was a decided gain—the\r\nSenate created a Majority Committee on Woman Suffrage. The Woman\r\nSuffrage Committee in the Senate had been a Minority Committee\r\nthitherto. That meant that, as its Chairman belonged to the Minority\r\nParty, its existence was purely nominal.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAll these four months, the five women who constituted the Congressional\r\nCommittee had been working at a tremendous speed. They had been made\r\ninto a Committee on the understanding that the Committee would itself\r\nraise the money necessary for its work. Four months’ experience had\r\nconvinced them that the work of securing a Federal Amendment required a\r\nmuch greater effort than five women, working alone, could possibly give\r\nto it. The various State associations composing the National American\r\nWoman Suffrage Association were engrossed in their State campaigns.\r\nLittle could be expected from them in the way of personal service or\r\nfinancial aid. When the Congressional Committee appealed to individuals,\r\nthey found that these individuals were giving their time and service to\r\nthe particular State in which they lived. The Congressional Committee\r\nrealized that they must have an organization back of them to assist with\r\nwork and money, whose sole object was national work. The Congressional\r\nUnion for Woman Suffrage was therefore formed by the Congressional\r\nCommittee, with the approval of the President of the National American\r\nWoman Suffrage Association.\r\n\r\nThe Congressional Union described itself as “a group of women in all\r\nparts of the country who have joined together in the effort to secure\r\nthe passage of an Amendment to the United States Constitution\r\nenfranchising women.” It offered its members the privilege of making the\r\noffices at Washington their headquarters while in the city. It adopted\r\ncolors—at the happy suggestion of Mrs. John Jay White—of purple, white,\r\nand gold. The Union grew rapidly, and was later admitted as an auxiliary\r\nto the National American Woman Suffrage Association. The Congressional\r\nCommittee acted as the Executive Committee of this Congressional Union.\r\nThroughout the year the Union was of great assistance to the Committee.\r\nIt reinforced its work in every possible way.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Suffrage resolution was now before the Committees in both Houses.\r\nThe Congressional Union concentrated on securing a hearing before the\r\nSenate Committee. Every effort was made to focus the attention of\r\nSuffragists and of the country at large on the situation. A hearing was\r\narranged before the Committee, at which Dr. Anna Howard Shaw, President\r\nof the National American Woman Suffrage Association, presided. In\r\naddition to this public hearing, the members of the Senate Committee\r\nwere interviewed. And pursuing its course of keeping Suffragists in\r\ntouch with what was happening at Washington, the Congressional Committee\r\ncircularized Suffragists all over the country with letters which\r\ninformed them that the resolution was before the Senate Committee, and\r\nasked them to write to this Committee urging a favorable report.\r\n\r\nAfter six months of work occurred the first political triumph of the\r\nCongressional Union. On May 13, the Senate Committee voted to make a\r\nfavorable report upon the Suffrage resolution. There, however, matters\r\nrested—with a favorable vote, but still in the Committee. The\r\nSuffragists, however, besieged the Committee with requests to make the\r\nreport and finally, on June 13, the report was made to the Senate—the\r\nfirst favorable one in twenty-one years. This put the measure on the\r\nSenate Calendar.\r\n\r\nImmediately the Congressional Union turned its attention to proving to\r\nthe Senate how widespread was the support of this measure in the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nA petition was circulated in every State in the Union. It asked for the\r\npassage of the Amendment, and was addressed to the Senate. Thousands of\r\nsignatures were obtained. During June and July, these petitions were\r\ncollected and brought to Washington. Their arrival at the Capitol on\r\nJuly 31 was the occasion of the third great demonstration. The\r\npetitioners came from every State, and they came in every possible way.\r\nThey came by train, by motor, by caravan. They held meetings and\r\ncollected signatures to the great petition in the districts through\r\nwhich they passed. All the delegations converged in the little town of\r\nHyattsville, outside Washington. There—at the village grandstand, they\r\nwere met by members of the Congressional Union and of the Woman Suffrage\r\nCommittee of the Senate. The reading clerk of the House of\r\nRepresentatives announced the members of the delegations as they arrived\r\nin their several motors. Members of the Senate Committee addressed them\r\non behalf of the Congressional Committee of the Congressional Union. The\r\nMayor of Hyattsville delivered to them the key of the town. Mary Ware\r\nDennett replied for the delegates, and accepted the key of the town from\r\nthe Mayor. The automobiles then formed into a procession, of which the\r\nfirst motor carried the members of the Senate Committee. The long line\r\nof cars, fluttering flags, and pennants, and each bearing the banner of\r\nits State delegation, proceeded from Hyattsville along the old Bunker\r\nHill Road to the Capitol. There, the petitions were handed to the\r\nvarious Senators. Three Senators spoke against Suffrage, but twenty-two\r\nin presenting the petitions spoke in favor of it.\r\n\r\nThis was the second triumph of the Congressional Union. Suffrage was\r\ndebated in Congress—the first time since 1887.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Congressional Committee now turned its attention to the work of\r\nconvincing Congress of the interest in the Amendment of the women voters\r\nof the West. A Convention of the National Council of Women Voters was\r\nheld in Washington on August 13, 14, and 15. Emma Smith Devoe, National\r\nPresident of the Council, and Jane Addams, National Vice-President,\r\npresided. Upon a motion by Jane Addams, the Council passed the following\r\nResolution, strongly indorsing the Amendment:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Whereas at the present time one-fifth of the Senate, one-seventh of\r\n    the House, and one-sixth of the electoral vote comes from equal\r\n    Suffrage States; and\r\n\r\n    Whereas, as a result of this political strength in Congress, due to\r\n    the fact that four million women of the United States are now\r\n    enfranchised, there is great hope of the passage in the near future\r\n    of the Federal Suffrage Amendment; therefore be it\r\n\r\n    Resolved, That the National Council of Women Voters concentrate its\r\n    efforts upon the support of this Federal Amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Rules Committee of the House of Representatives on August 14 then\r\ngave the Council a hearing on the question of creating a Suffrage\r\nCommittee in the House.\r\n\r\nThe Convention ended in a mass-meeting at the Belasco Theatre, which, in\r\nspite of the midsummer heat of Washington, was crowded to the doors. The\r\nplatform was filled with Congressmen from Suffrage States. The women\r\nspeakers iterated and reiterated the demand of the women voters of the\r\nWest for immediate action by Congress, and the Congressmen supported\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these—processions, pilgrimages, petitions, deputations,\r\nand hearings, hundreds of public meetings organized by the Washington\r\nHeadquarters—were held everywhere. A constant series of deputations from\r\ntheir own constituencies besieged the members of the Senate. All this\r\nwas making its inevitable impression on Congress. Those days of the\r\nSixty-third Congressional Session were crowded ones. The President had\r\ntold the Suffragists that so much time must be given to the tariff and\r\nthe currency that there would be none left for Women Suffrage. Yet more\r\ntime was devoted to the Woman Suffrage question than ever before. On\r\nSeptember 18, Senator Wesley L. Jones of Washington delivered a speech\r\nin the Senate, in which he urged that the Suffrage Resolution should be\r\npassed. In the House, a number of Representatives formerly opposed to\r\nthe resolution now declared that they would support it when it came\r\nbefore them.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the tariff and currency had finally been disposed of. A\r\nnew Congress was to convene on December 1. Ever since his inauguration,\r\nSuffrage agitation of a strong, dignified, and convincing character had\r\nbeen brought to the President’s attention. Suffragists hoped, therefore,\r\nthat the President would feel that he could recommend the Suffrage\r\nAmendment to this new Congress. They decided, however, to present the\r\nmatter to him in a forcible way. A fourth deputation of seventy-three\r\nwomen from his own State of New Jersey came to Washington in the middle\r\nof November.\r\n\r\nThis delegation arrived on Saturday afternoon, November 15. Until Monday\r\nmorning, they tried in every possible way to arrange for an appointment\r\nwith the President at the White House. Representative McCoy of New\r\nJersey endeavored to assist them in this matter. Their efforts and his\r\nefforts were fruitless.\r\n\r\nMonday morning, at 10 o’clock, Alice Paul telephoned the Executive\r\nOffice that, as it was impossible to find out what hour would suit the\r\nconvenience of the President, the delegation was on its way to the White\r\nHouse. She explained that they would wait there until the President was\r\nready to receive them, or would definitely refuse to do so. The clerk at\r\nthe Executive Office declared over the telephone that it would be\r\nimpossible to see the President without an appointment. He assured Alice\r\nPaul that such a thing had never been done. Representative McCoy called\r\nup Headquarters, and reported his failure to secure an appointment. On\r\nbeing told that the delegation was going to call on the President\r\nanyway, he protested vehemently against its proceeding to the White\r\nHouse without the usual official preliminaries. Alice Paul’s answer was\r\na single statement,—“The delegation has already started.”\r\n\r\nIn double file the seventy-three New Jersey women marched through\r\nFifteenth Street, through Pennsylvania Avenue, past the Treasury\r\nDepartment, and up to the White House grounds. And, lo, as though their\r\ncoming spread paralyzing magic, everything gave way before them. Two\r\nguards in uniform stood at the gate. They saluted and moved aside. The\r\nseventy-three women marched unchallenged through the grounds to the door\r\nof the Executive Office. An attendant there requested them courteously\r\nto wait until after their two leaders should be presented to the\r\nPresident by his Secretary.\r\n\r\nThe request that these seventy-three New Jersey women made to President\r\nWilson was that he should support the Constitutional Amendment\r\nenfranchising women. President Wilson replied: “I am pleased, indeed, to\r\ngreet you and your adherents here, and I will say to you that I was\r\ntalking only yesterday with several Members of Congress in regard to the\r\nSuffrage Committee in the House. The subject is one in which I am deeply\r\ninterested, and you may rest assured that I will give it my earnest\r\nattention.”\r\n\r\nIt is to be seen that the President’s education had progressed—a little.\r\nTo previous delegations, he had stated merely that the tariff and\r\ncurrency would take so much of the attention of Congress that there\r\nwould be no time for the Suffrage question. In advocating a Suffrage\r\nCommittee in the House, he had made an advance—tiny, to be sure, but an\r\nadvance.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the last month of 1913 occurred in Washington the Forty-fifth Annual\r\nConvention of the National American Woman Suffrage Association. The\r\nConvention opened with a mass-meeting at the Columbia Theatre. Dr. Anna\r\nHoward Shaw presided. Jane Addams and Senator Helen Ring Robinson were\r\nthe principal speakers. At the opening meeting of the Convention, Lucy\r\nBurns repeated the warning of the Congressional Union to the Democratic\r\nParty:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The National American Women Suffrage Association is assembled in\r\n    Washington to ask the Democratic Party to enfranchise the women of\r\n    America.\r\n\r\n    Rarely in the history of the country has a party been more powerful\r\n    than the Democratic Party is today. It controls the Executive\r\n    Office, the Senate, and more than two-thirds of the members of the\r\n    House of Representatives. It is in a position to give us effective\r\n    and immediate help.\r\n\r\n    We ask the Democrats to take action now. Those who hold power are\r\n    responsible to the country for the use of it. They are responsible,\r\n    not only for what they do, but for what they do not do. Inaction\r\n    establishes just as clear a record as does a policy of open\r\n    hostility.\r\n\r\n    We have in our hands today not only the weapon of a just case; we\r\n    have the support of ten enfranchised States—States comprising\r\n    one-fifth of the United States, one-seventh of the House of\r\n    Representatives and one-sixth of the electoral vote. More than three\r\n    million, six hundred thousand women have a vote in Presidential\r\n    elections. It is unthinkable that a national government which\r\n    represents women, and which appeals periodically to the Suffrages of\r\n    women, should ignore the issue of their right to political freedom.\r\n\r\n    We cannot wait until after the passage of the scheduled\r\n    administration reforms. These reforms, which affect women, should\r\n    not be enacted without the consent of women. Congress is free to\r\n    take action on our question in the present Session. We ask the\r\n    administration to support the Woman Suffrage Amendment in Congress\r\n    with its full strength.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn December 4, a second meeting was held before the Rules Committee of\r\nthe House on the creation of a Woman Suffrage Committee in the House of\r\nRepresentatives. Ida Husted Harper reminded the Rules Committee at this\r\nhearing that nine States and one Territory had enfranchised their women,\r\nand that nearly four million women could vote at a Presidential\r\nelection. Mary Beard showed by an analysis of the vote which sent\r\nPresident Wilson to the White House that the Democratic strength was\r\nalready threatened, and how it could strengthen itself by espousing the\r\nSuffrage Cause.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the appeal of the seventy-three New Jersey women, the\r\nPresident’s message to Congress on December 2 failed to make any mention\r\nwhatever of the Suffrage Amendment.\r\n\r\nIn consequence, a Committee representing each State in the Union was\r\nappointed by the Convention of the National American Woman Suffrage\r\nAssociation to wait upon the President and protest. President Wilson was\r\nprevented by illness from seeing any visitors during the week the\r\nConvention met. The Convention, therefore, authorized the appointment of\r\na Committee of fifty-five delegates, who should remain in Washington\r\nuntil the President was able to see them. The interview took place the\r\nfollowing Monday at 12:30. This was the fifth deputation to President\r\nWilson. The President said, according to the _Washington Post_ of\r\nDecember 9:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I want you ladies, if possible—if I can make it clear to you—to\r\n    realize just what my present position is. Whenever I walk abroad, I\r\n    realize that I am not a free man; I am under arrest. I am so\r\n    carefully and admirably guarded that I have not even the privilege\r\n    of walking the street. That is, as it were, typical of my present\r\n    transference from being an individual with his mind on any and every\r\n    subject, to being an official of a great Government and,\r\n    incidentally, or so it falls out under our system of Government, the\r\n    spokesman of a Party. I set myself this strict rule when I was\r\n    Governor of New Jersey and have followed it as President, and shall\r\n    follow it as President, that I am not at liberty to urge upon\r\n    Congress policies which have not had the organic consideration of\r\n    those for whom I am spokesman.\r\n\r\n    In other words, I have not yet presented to any legislature my\r\n    private views on any subject, and I never shall; because I conceive\r\n    that to be a part of the whole process of government, that I shall\r\n    be spokesman for somebody, not for myself.\r\n\r\n    When I speak for myself, I am an individual; when I speak for an\r\n    organic body, I am a representative. For that reason you see, I am\r\n    by my own principles shut out, in the language of the street, from\r\n    starting anything. I have to confine myself to those things which\r\n    have been embodied as promises to the people at an election. That is\r\n    the strict rule I set for myself.\r\n\r\n    I want to say that with regard to all other matters I am not only\r\n    glad to be consulted by my colleagues in the two Houses, but I hope\r\n    that they will often pay me the compliment of consulting me when\r\n    they want to know my opinions on any subject. One member of the\r\n    Rules Committee did come to ask me what I thought about this\r\n    suggestion of yours of appointing a special committee for\r\n    consideration of the question of Woman Suffrage, and I told him that\r\n    I thought it was a proper thing to do. So that as far as my personal\r\n    advice has been asked by a single member of the Committee, it has\r\n    been given to that effect. I wanted to tell you that to show you\r\n    that I am strictly living up to my principles. When my private\r\n    opinion is asked by those who are co-operating with me, I am most\r\n    glad to give it; but I am not at liberty until I speak for somebody\r\n    besides myself to urge legislation upon the Congress.\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Shaw stepped forward to address the President within the circle of\r\ndeeply attentive hearers, spoke very quietly and firmly in her clear and\r\nbeautiful voice.\r\n\r\n“Of the two—the President and Dr. Shaw,” said one of the spectators\r\nafterward, “Dr. Shaw spoke with greater authority, as if with the\r\nconsciousness of a perfectly just cause. The President was less assured,\r\nmore hesitating.”...\r\n\r\n“As women are members of no political Party, to whom are they to look\r\nfor a spokesman?” Dr. Shaw asked.\r\n\r\n“You speak very well for yourself,” said the President, laughing.\r\n\r\n“But not with authority,” said Dr. Shaw earnestly.\r\n\r\nThe deputation then left the President’s Office.\r\n\r\nEditorially in the _Suffragist_ of December 13 appears:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The rule that President Wilson has so strictly set for himself, is a\r\n    rule not laid down in the Constitution nor in the practice of\r\n    preceding Presidents, nor in the President’s own acts, nor in his\r\n    own words.\r\n\r\n    Nevertheless, the statement of President Wilson to the President of\r\n    the National American Woman Suffrage Association is of great value\r\n    to the Suffrage movement. The President therein declares that he is\r\n    only the spokesman of his Party and that he will initiate only\r\n    legislation which has been endorsed by his Party. He puts the whole\r\n    question of Federal legislation for Woman Suffrage directly up to\r\n    the Democratic Party in Congress, and instructs Suffragists\r\n    throughout the country to hold that Party responsible for the fate\r\n    of the Constitutional Amendment enfranchising women. He has outlined\r\n    for us, therefore, the policy of bringing effective pressure to bear\r\n    on the national Democratic Party from all parts of the country, in\r\n    an effort to make them realize soon what they must recognize\r\n    finally, that it is more expedient for them as a Party to advocate\r\n    Suffrage than to ignore and resist it.\r\n\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the President’s education had progressed another step. For\r\nthe first time, he felt the necessity of explaining—and by\r\nimplication—of excusing himself.\r\n\r\nThis visit to the President completed the principal work of the year\r\n1913 on the part of the Congressional Committee and the Congressional\r\nUnion.\r\n\r\nMany things had been done in this year, in addition to what has already\r\nbeen indicated. A district of Columbia Branch of the Men’s League for\r\nWoman Suffrage was organized; this was composed largely of Congressmen.\r\nLectures, receptions, tableaux, benefits, teas had been given, and a\r\nSuffrage School opened in Washington. Seven large mass-meetings,\r\nexclusive of Convention meetings, were held at Washington. An\r\nuninterrupted series of indoor and outdoor meetings, numbering\r\nfrequently from five to ten a day, constantly reminded Congress of the\r\nSuffrage question. A summer campaign, carried on by Mabel Vernon and\r\nEdith Marsden, covered the resort regions of New Jersey, Long Island,\r\nand Rhode Island, and extended into the South.\r\n\r\nTwenty-seven thousand dollars had been raised at the Washington\r\nHeadquarters, and spent. And there were results. The chief one was that\r\nit focussed the attention—not only of Suffragists themselves—but of\r\npoliticians and the country at large on the Federal Amendment.\r\n\r\nJune, 1913, brought Presidential Suffrage to the women of Illinois. Only\r\nPresidential Suffrage; but that was very important. Astute women\r\neverywhere were watching the situation; drawing their own and\r\nindependent conclusions.\r\n\r\nToward the end of the year, the Congressional Union established an\r\nofficial weekly organ, the _Suffragist_, edited by the well-known\r\npublicist, Rheta Childe Dorr. The first issue appeared on November 15,\r\nand it has been published ever since.\r\n\r\nLucy Burns, whose editorials were marvels of ironic logic, of forceful\r\ncondensed expression, succeeded Mrs. Dorr. Then came Vivian Pierce, a\r\ntrained newspaper woman; Sue White, well-known to Suffragists for her\r\nsplendid work in Tennessee; Florence Boeckel, able, efficient, untiring.\r\nPauline Clarke, Clara Wold, Elizabeth Kalb contributed supplementing\r\neditorial work.\r\n\r\nThe _Suffragist_ has reported the activities first of the Congressional\r\nUnion, and next of the Woman’s Party. It is an extremely entertaining\r\nperiodical, always interesting, often brilliant, essentially readable.\r\nIt contains editorials, reports, sketches, verse, cartoons. Many famous\r\npeople have contributed articles. The reports of the workers in the\r\nWoman’s Party make much the most interesting reading however. Many\r\nfamous artists have given it drawings. The most pertinent, though, are\r\nthose contributed by a member of the Congressional Union—Nina Allender.\r\n\r\nMrs. Allender’s fertile and original pencil has traced during the entire\r\neight years of its history a running commentary on the progress of the\r\nWoman’s Party. She has a keen political sense. She has translated this\r\naspect of the feminist movement in terms that women alone can best\r\nappreciate. Her work is full of the intimate everyday details of the\r\nwoman’s life from her little girlhood to her old age. And she translates\r\nthat existence with a woman’s vivacity and a woman’s sense of humor; a\r\nhumor which plays keenly and gracefully about masculine insensibility; a\r\nhumor as realistic, but as archly un-bitter as that of Jane Austen. It\r\nwould be impossible for any man to have done Mrs. Allender’s work. A\r\nwoman speaking to women, about women, in the language of women.\r\n\r\nThere is no better place than here to emphasize the work of the Press\r\nDepartment. It will be apparent to the reader, as the story of the\r\nWoman’s Party unrolls itself, that the work of this department was very\r\ndifficult and very delicate. The problem was twofold—to keep the action\r\nof the party always in the public eye and to bring out the underlying\r\npolicy. This was not easy when the demonstrations of the Woman’s Party\r\nwere of the kind whose initial effect was to antagonize. Nevertheless,\r\nthe Press Department minimized that antagonism and minimized by a\r\npropaganda which was as restrained in expression as it was vivid in\r\ndescription. Newspaper men generally felt that they could depend on the\r\nWoman’s Party for news. Florence Brewer Boeckel, who has been press\r\nchairman since 1915, is responsible for this magnificent press campaign.\r\nBut she has not lacked help. Eleanor Taylor Marsh, Alice Gram, Beulah\r\nAmidon, and Margaret Grahan Jones, have given her steady assistance.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEarly in the year 1914, the Congressional Union resigned from the\r\nNational American Woman Suffrage Association. The constitution of the\r\nNational Association permitted a Suffrage body to join it in one of two\r\nways. By one, a new clause imposed a five per cent tax in dues upon its\r\nbudget. By another, it paid annually one hundred dollars dues. The\r\nCongressional Union felt that a five per cent tax upon its budget would\r\nseriously cripple its work. The Union offered to become an associated\r\nbody. The National Association refused this offer, and the Congressional\r\nUnion, therefore, became an independent organization.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   VI\r\n\r\n                          PRESSURE ON CONGRESS\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE _Suffragist_ of January 24, 1914, carried the following editorial.\r\nIn it is repeated the policy which the Congressional Union had in the\r\nbeginning adopted—that of holding the party in power responsible.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The policy of the Congressional Union is to ask for a Woman Suffrage\r\n    Amendment from the Party in power in Congress, and to hold them\r\n    responsible for their answer to its request.\r\n\r\n    This policy is entirely non-partisan, in that it handles all Parties\r\n    with perfect impartiality. If the Republicans were in power, we\r\n    would regard them in their capacity as head of the Government as\r\n    responsible for the enfranchisement of women. If the Progressives or\r\n    Socialists should become the majority Party, and control the\r\n    machinery of Congress, we would claim from them the right to govern\r\n    ourselves, and would hold them responsible for a refusal of this\r\n    just demand.\r\n\r\n    Today the Democrats are in power. They control the executive office,\r\n    the Senate, and the House. They can, if they will, enfranchise women\r\n    in the present session; their refusal to do so establishes a record\r\n    which must necessarily be taken into consideration by women when the\r\n    Party seeks the re-indorsement of the people at the polls.\r\n\r\n    This policy simply recognizes the effect of our American system of\r\n    Government. Ours is a government by Parties. The majority by secret\r\n    caucus, by the control of committees, by the power of patronage, by\r\n    their appeal to Party responsibility, by the interest of Party\r\n    solidarity, control the legislation of the House. The present\r\n    government recognizes this method of administration with especial,\r\n    and indeed admirable, frankness. It owes much of its popularity\r\n    today to its willingness to assume full responsibility for all the\r\n    legislation enacted in Congress; for whatever is done, and what is\r\n    not done. The two great measures of the last session, tariff and\r\n    currency, passed rapidly and successfully through both Houses by the\r\n    frank use of Party discipline.\r\n\r\n    Let us by all means deal directly with the people who can give us\r\n    what we want. The Democrats have it in their power to enfranchise\r\n    women.... This is not only our most logical method of work, but it\r\n    is also the most economical and expeditious. Assuming that the\r\n    Democrats yield nothing in the present session, we can, when\r\n    Congress closes, concentrate our forces on those points where the\r\n    Party is weakest, and thus become a force worth bargaining with. At\r\n    the present moment, the Senate is the weakest point in the\r\n    Democratic armor. To defeat even a few Democratic Senators in\r\n    November, 1914, would make a serious breach in the Party\r\n    organization.... If, on the other hand, we set out to attack every\r\n    anti-Suffragist in Congress, we should have hundreds to defeat, and\r\n    every man would be safe in whose constituency we did not organize.\r\n    Imagine that, if at the end of arduous labor, we had contrived to\r\n    defeat a number of Democratic anti-Suffragists, and an equal number\r\n    of Republican anti-Suffragists, we should by immense sacrifice have\r\n    completely nullified our own efforts, and left the strength of the\r\n    Parties just where it was before....\r\n\r\n    What should we do in our enfranchised States, if we confined\r\n    ourselves to the plan of supporting individual Suffragists and\r\n    attacking individual anti-Suffragists, irrespective of their Party\r\n    affiliations? All the candidates for office in the enfranchised\r\n    States are Suffragists. Is it suggested that we be inactive in the\r\n    only places where we possess real political power? Our problem at\r\n    the present moment is to use the strength of women’s votes in\r\n    national elections so as to force attention to the justice of our\r\n    claim from the present administration....\r\n\r\n    But the Congressional Union cannot make it too clear that we are not\r\n    opposed to any Party today. We are asking the Democrats to help us;\r\n    we are awaiting their answer. We will frame no policy for or against\r\n    them or any other Party until this session closes, and the great\r\n    opportunity of the present Administration has come to an end. We\r\n    entertain steady and undiminished hopes that the Administration will\r\n    recognize the justice and expediency of women’s claims to\r\n    self-government. The movement is making immense strides in every\r\n    part of the country; our present voting strength is great, and will\r\n    undoubtedly be increased in the present year. It takes no great\r\n    imaginative reach for the ordinary Congressman to foresee the day\r\n    when Woman Suffrage will be an established fact throughout these\r\n    United States.\r\n\r\n    There is already a strong sentiment in the Upper House for Woman\r\n    Suffrage, and a rapidly-growing interest in it in the Lower House.\r\n    We have no reason to expect wilful obstinacy from our American\r\n    Congressmen. We Americans are adaptable and imaginative, and can\r\n    shape ourselves with peculiar ease to coming events. The Democratic\r\n    Party, if it is wise, will pass our Amendment through Congress in\r\n    the present session.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first-year Congressional Committee, consisting of Alice Paul, Lucy\r\nBurns, Mary Beard, Crystal Eastman, and Mrs. Lawrence Lewis, continued\r\ntheir work in 1914 with the Congressional Union under the name of the\r\nExecutive Committee of the Congressional Union; but it was increased by\r\nthe addition of Mrs. William Kent, Elsie Hill, Mrs. Gilson Gardner, Mrs.\r\nDonald R. Hooker, and Mrs. O. H. P. Belmont.\r\n\r\nThe year opened with a meeting at the home of Mrs. William Kent in\r\nWashington. Plans for the coming year were submitted at that meeting.\r\nAmong them was one for a nation-wide demonstration on May 2, in which\r\nresolutions supporting the Federal Amendment were to be passed. This was\r\nto be followed by a great demonstration in Washington on May 9, at which\r\nthose resolutions should be presented to Congress. Among them also was\r\nanother plan for the appeal to the women voters of the West for\r\npolitical action in support of a Federal Amendment, if that Amendment\r\nhad not been passed before the next election. Nine thousand dollars were\r\npledged on the spot for these undertakings. The work on the great\r\ndemonstration of May 2 began at once, and was pushed rapidly during the\r\nopening months of the year.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the work on Congress was continued. It will be\r\nremembered that a proposal for the formation of a Suffrage Committee in\r\nthe House had been before the Rules Committee since April 7, 1913, that\r\nit had been the subject of two hearings arranged by the Congressional\r\nUnion. The first action in regard to this was simple and decisive. The\r\nDemocratic Members of the Rules Committee, who constituted a Majority\r\nCommittee, met first, apart from their Republican and Progressive\r\ncolleagues, and, by a vote of four to three, decided against the\r\nformation of a Suffrage Committee. They then went through the form of a\r\nmeeting with the Republican and Progressive Members on January 24. The\r\nresolution, creating the Suffrage Committee, was lost by a vote of four\r\nto four.\r\n\r\nThe Congressional Union, however, realized that the final power with\r\nregard to Congressional action was with the Democratic Caucus. They\r\ndetermined therefore—in order that the responsibility for inaction or\r\nopposition might be placed on the Democrats as a Party—immediately to\r\nappeal to that Caucus to overturn the decision of the Rules Committee.\r\nThe necessary signatures were secured to a petition calling for the\r\nDemocratic Caucus of the House to take up the question of the formation\r\nof this much-desired Suffrage Committee. The Caucus met on February 3,\r\n1914, to consider this subject. The Democratic Party had a choice of two\r\ncourses. It could order the Rules Committee, which it of course\r\ncontrolled, to give a favorable report to the House on the resolution\r\ncreating a Suffrage Committee. Or it could give no order at all of this\r\nkind; in which case it revealed itself as responsible for the adverse\r\naction of the Rules Committee.\r\n\r\nWhat it did was to adopt a substitute resolution for the resolution\r\nproviding for the creation of a Committee of Woman Suffrage.\r\n\r\nThat substitute resolution was: “Resolved, that the question of Woman\r\nSuffrage is a State and not a Federal question.”\r\n\r\nThis was the first time in the history of the country that either of the\r\ntwo great Parties had ever caucused on Woman Suffrage.\r\n\r\nEditorially the _Suffragist_ put the situation pithily to the women of\r\nAmerica:\r\n\r\n\r\n    This is the definite lining up of the Democratic Party against Woman\r\n    Suffrage as a national measure.... Unless the Democratic Party\r\n    reconsiders its present position, Suffragists must necessarily\r\n    regard that Party as an obstruction in the path of their\r\n    campaign.... They (the Democratic Party) have three votes to lose in\r\n    the Senate and they lose control of this government. There are nine\r\n    States in which women vote for United States Senators. The result in\r\n    the Senatorial elections in these States will undoubtedly depend\r\n    largely upon the action on Suffrage taken by the Democratic Party.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the Congressional Union welcomed any simplification of the\r\nCongressional machinery as by the creation of a Suffrage Committee, its\r\nobject was to secure action on the Suffrage Amendment. Since April 7,\r\n1913, the Amendment had been before the Judiciary Committee in which it\r\nhad been introduced by Representative Mondell. The Congressional Union\r\nasked for a hearing on the Amendment before this Committee. March 3,\r\n1914, was set for that event.\r\n\r\nThitherto, these hearings had been dreary occasions, sparsely attended.\r\nThere was the half-circle of Committee members, a trifle perfunctory in\r\nits attitude, the scattered, tiny audience, very little interested or\r\nstirred; the few Suffragists pleading—eloquently, it is true—but\r\npleading; using the inevitable Suffrage arguments, unanswerable, but\r\nthreadbare. The hearing of March 3 was very different. The Committee was\r\nelectrically alert.... They listened intently.... For the first time at\r\na Congressional hearing, propagandistic argument did not appear. The\r\nSuffragists appealed to the Committee to report the Suffrage Resolution\r\nto the House—not as a matter of justice to women—but as _practical\r\npolitics_. They pointed out to the Committee that the women voters of\r\nthe West would hold the Democratic Party responsible for the refusal of\r\nthis Committee to make that report.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, highly important things had been going on in the\r\nSenate. It will be remembered that the Suffrage Resolution had been\r\nplaced upon the Senate Calendar in June, 1913. Ever since that date, it\r\nhad been awaiting a vote. It could be voted on any time up to the close\r\nof the Sixty-third Congress (March 3, 1915).\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the year 1914, more votes were pledged in its favor\r\nthan had carried the Income Tax in the Senate, and sentiment in its\r\nfavor was steadily increasing among the Senators. Moreover, the prospect\r\nthat the Referendum elections of the coming autumn would add to the\r\nnumber of Suffrage States promised an increase of Suffrage strength in\r\nthe Senate. There remained—as it transpired—a whole year before that\r\nCongress adjourned, in which the work of obtaining the vote could have\r\ngone on. These features of the situation made the Congressional Union\r\nmost desirous that the Resolution should not be voted upon until every\r\npossible vote was won. However, Senator Ashurst, who had reported the\r\nBill to the Senate, had it made “unfinished business” on March 2, 1914.\r\nIt is the spirit of “unfinished business” that it must be brought up and\r\nvoted on. In spite of the vigorous protests of the Congressional Union,\r\nand of many Suffragists in all parts of the country, it was brought to\r\nthe vote on March 17. A two-thirds vote was necessary to carry it. It\r\nreceived thirty-five; a majority, it is true, of one vote; but failing\r\nof the necessary two-thirds majority by eleven. The Congressional Union\r\nblamed the Democratic leaders entirely for this premature vote, as they\r\nwere fully informed that a vote at that time would mean defeat.\r\n\r\nHowever, this was a memorable moment. It was the first time since 1887\r\nthat Suffrage had been voted upon in the Senate. And from the moment on\r\nMarch 2 when it was made “unfinished business” until March 17, when the\r\nvote was taken, the Senate debated it almost continuously.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn that same day—March 2—Senator Shafroth of Colorado introduced a\r\nresolution providing for a new Suffrage Amendment to the Federal\r\nConstitution. This was to become famous as the Shafroth-Palmer\r\nResolution. It offered a path to the enfranchisement of women incredibly\r\ncluttered and cumbered. It reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Section 1. Whenever any number of legal voters of any State to a\r\n    number exceeding eight per cent of the number of legal voters voting\r\n    at the last preceding General Election held in such State shall\r\n    petition for the submission to the legal voters of said State of the\r\n    question whether women shall have equal rights with men in respect\r\n    to voting at all elections to be held in such State, such question\r\n    shall be so submitted; and if, upon such submission, a majority of\r\n    the legal voters of the State voting on the question shall vote in\r\n    favor of granting to women such equal rights, the same shall\r\n    thereupon be deemed established, anything in the constitution or\r\n    laws of such State to the contrary notwithstanding.\r\n\r\n\r\nCompare this with the simplicity and directness of the original Susan B.\r\nAnthony Amendment:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Section 1. The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall\r\n    not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on\r\n    account of sex.\r\n\r\n    Section 2. Congress shall have power by appropriate legislation to\r\n    enforce the provisions of this article.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe National American Woman Suffrage Association immediately rallied to\r\nthe support of the Shafroth-Palmer Amendment; they continued to give to\r\nit their undivided work for two years.\r\n\r\nBut the Congressional Union—I quote the vigorous words of the Report of\r\nthe Congressional Union for the year 1914:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Congressional Union immediately announced its determination to\r\n    support only the original Amendment, known popularly as the Susan B.\r\n    Anthony Amendment, and in Congress as the Bristow-Mondell Amendment.\r\n    It maintained that to work at the same time for two Suffrage\r\n    amendments to the National Constitution would enable the enemies of\r\n    the bill to play one against the other. Believing that one amendment\r\n    only must be supported, it felt that it was wise to support the\r\n    amendment which would give Suffrage itself rather than an amendment\r\n    which, after the same expenditure of effort would give _only another\r\n    method of obtaining Suffrage_—that is, would merely establish the\r\n    initiative on the Suffrage question. The Union, moreover, feeling\r\n    that the bane of the Suffrage cause at present was too many and not\r\n    too few referendums, held that to pass a Federal Amendment—which\r\n    would inaugurate thirty-nine referendum campaigns would involve the\r\n    movement in a dissipation of resources such as its enemies would\r\n    most deeply desire. Finally, it held that the passage of one\r\n    Suffrage amendment to the National Constitution would make it\r\n    extremely difficult to pass another; so that if the Shafroth Bill\r\n    became a law, it would probably indefinitely postpone the passage of\r\n    the Anthony Amendment, and doom the movement to years of referendum\r\n    campaigns.\r\n\r\n\r\nNot at all daunted by the action of the Senate in defeating the Susan B.\r\nAnthony Amendment, nor by the introduction there of the Shafroth-Palmer\r\nAmendment, the Congressional Union at once secured the re-introduction\r\nin the Senate of the defeated Amendment. The measure was out of the\r\nSenate only twenty-two hours. The following day, Senator Bristow\r\nintroduced a resolution identical with the one which had been lost. On\r\nApril 7, it was again reported from the Woman Suffrage Committee, and\r\ntook its place on the Calendar of the Senate. This was just a year from\r\nthe date of its original introduction to this Senate. It was the second\r\nfavorable report of the Senate Committee in one Congress.\r\n\r\nHere we leave the work with Congress for a while, and take up the matter\r\nof the education of the President. We must go back a few months.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  VII\r\n\r\n                       PRESSURE ON THE PRESIDENT\r\n\r\n\r\nALTHOUGH five different deputations—Congressional Union members; college\r\nwomen; women voters; New Jersey women; women from all the States—had\r\ncalled on the President, it was apparent that he had undergone no change\r\nin his attitude toward the Suffrage question. On February 2, 1914,\r\ntherefore, another deputation, the sixth—and an exceedingly interesting\r\none—marched to the White House. This deputation included women from the\r\nindustrial world and they represented more than fifty trades in which\r\nwomen are engaged. They carried banners which bore quotations from the\r\nPresident’s _New Freedom_: “We Have Got to Humanize Industry,” and “I\r\nAbsolutely Protest Against Being Put into the Hands of Trustees.”\r\n\r\nAt the mass-meeting, preliminary to waiting upon the President, Melinda\r\nScott, an organizer of the Women’s Trade Union League, said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    No one could be serious when they maintained that the ballot will\r\n    not help the working woman. It has helped the working-man to better\r\n    his conditions and his wages. Men of every class regard the ballot\r\n    as their greatest protection against the injustice of other men.\r\n    Women even more than men need the ballot to protect their especial\r\n    interests and their right to earn a living.... We want a law that\r\n    will prohibit home-work.... We hear about the sacredness of the\r\n    home. What sacredness is there about a home when it is turned into a\r\n    factory, where we find a mother, very often with a child at her\r\n    breast, running a sewing machine? Running up thirty-seven seams for\r\n    a cent. Ironing and pressing shirts seventy cents a dozen, and\r\n    children making artificial flowers for one cent a gross. Think of\r\n    it—one hundred and forty flowers for one cent. Taking stitches out\r\n    of coats, helping their mothers where they have finished them for\r\n    six cents a coat. These women have had no chance to make laws that\r\n    would protect themselves or their children....\r\n\r\n    The organized working woman has learnt through her trade union the\r\n    power of industrial organization, and she realizes what her power\r\n    would be if she had the ballot.... Men legislating as a class for\r\n    women and children as a class have done exactly what every other\r\n    ruling class has done since the history of the world. They\r\n    discriminate against the class that has no voice. Some of the men\r\n    say, “You women do not need a ballot; we will take care of you.” We\r\n    have no faith in man’s protection.... Give us the ballot, and we\r\n    will protect ourselves.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis army of four hundred arrived safely, with perfect police escort, at\r\nthe doors of the White House. They were amazed to learn that the\r\nPresident would see only twenty-five of the women. He had said he would\r\n“receive the delegation.” The selected number then went in, the\r\nremaining three hundred and seventy-five waited in line outside.\r\n\r\nMargaret Hinchey, a laundry worker of New York, said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Mr. President: It is shaking and trembling, I, as a laundry worker,\r\n    come here to speak in behalf of the working women of the United\r\n    States. I have read about you, and think you are fair, square, on\r\n    the level, and so much a real democrat, that I believe when it is\r\n    made clear to you how much we working women, who organize in the\r\n    factories, the mills, the laundries, and the stores, can help every\r\n    true democrat, you will use your power to wipe out this great\r\n    injustice to women by giving us a vote.\r\n\r\n\r\nRose Winslow said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Mr. President: I am one of the thousands of women who work in the\r\n    sweated trades, and have been since a child, who give their lives to\r\n    build up these tremendous industries in this country, and at the end\r\n    of the years of work, our reward is the tuberculosis sanatorium or\r\n    the street. I do not think to plead with you, Mr. President, nor\r\n    make a regular speech. I do not speak to Presidents every day; it\r\n    hasn’t been my job, so I don’t do it very gracefully.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere the President interrupted Miss Winslow by stating that he did not\r\nsee why she should be so nervous, as Presidents are perfectly human.\r\nMiss Winslow then continued:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Yes, I know, and that is why I can speak to you, because you are\r\n    human and have a heart and mind and can realize our great need. I do\r\n    not need to remind you how we women need the ballot, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe President said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I need not tell you that a group of women like this appeals to me\r\n    very deeply indeed. I do not have to tell you what my feelings are,\r\n    but I have already explained—because I feel obliged to explain—the\r\n    limitations that are laid upon me as the leader of a Party. Until\r\n    the Party, as such, has considered the matter of this very supreme\r\n    importance and taken its position, I am not at liberty to speak of\r\n    it; and yet, I am not at liberty to speak as an individual, for I am\r\n    not an individual. As you see, I either speak to it in a message, as\r\n    you suggest, or I do not speak at all. That is the limitation I am\r\n    under, and all I can say to you ladies, is that the strength of your\r\n    agitation in this matter undoubtedly will make a profound\r\n    impression.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn view of later opinions of the President in regard to his\r\nleadership—and in view of the fact that later even Democratic\r\nCongressmen referred to his “dictatorship”—his attitude to the women\r\nthis day was most interesting.\r\n\r\nMrs. Glendower Evans, who was in charge of the deputation, said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    We understand your position and its difficulties quite well, Mr.\r\n    President, but nevertheless we ask, where can we look for political\r\n    action? We recognize that the verdict must come not from you alone,\r\n    but from the whole Party. I do not ask you to break with your Party.\r\n    What I ask is, will you use your influence within your Party? I do\r\n    not ask the impossible, though I might from you, for you have done\r\n    the impossible.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is apparent that the President’s education was progressing. He was\r\nbeginning to be struck with the strength of the Woman Suffrage\r\nagitation; although he still believed himself powerless to help in the\r\nwork with Congress.\r\n\r\nEarly in June, 1914, the National Federation of Women’s Clubs meeting in\r\nChicago, had given its indorsement, as an organization, to Woman\r\nSuffrage. Following this action by the Federation, another\r\ndelegation—the seventh—of five hundred club women under the leadership\r\nof Mrs. Harvey W. Wiley, waited upon the President on June 30. I quote\r\nfrom the _Suffragist_:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The deputation had assembled for a preliminary mass-meeting at the\r\n    Public Library.... Leaving the Library, the deputation, which\r\n    extended over several blocks, marched in single files to the White\r\n    House.... It passed through the Arcade and into the East Room....\r\n    Women were massed about the State Apartment, filling it from end to\r\n    end, and leaving a hollow square in which Mrs. Ellis Logan and Mrs.\r\n    Wiley and Rheta Childe Dorr awaited the President’s arrival.\r\n    Preceded by his aide, the President entered....\r\n\r\n    “Mr. President,” said Mrs. Dorr, “we are well aware that you are the\r\n    busiest of men. I shall therefore go directly to the point and tell\r\n    you that our reason for calling on you today is to ask you if you\r\n    will not use your powerful influence with Congress to have the\r\n    Bristow-Mondell Amendment passed in this session.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe President replied:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Mrs. Wiley and Ladies: No one can fail to be impressed by this great\r\n    company of useful women, and I want to assure you that it is to me\r\n    most impressive. I have stated once before the position which, as\r\n    leader of a Party, I feel obliged to take, and I am sure you will\r\n    not wish me to state it again. Perhaps it would be more serviceable\r\n    if I ventured upon the confident conjecture that the Baltimore\r\n    Convention did not embody this very important question in the\r\n    platform which it adopted because of its conviction that the\r\n    principles of the Constitution which allotted these questions to the\r\n    State were well-considered principles from which they did not wish\r\n    to depart.\r\n\r\n    You have asked me to state my personal position in regard to the\r\n    pending measure. It is my conviction that this is a matter for\r\n    settlement by the States, and not by the Federal Government, and,\r\n    therefore, that being my personal conviction, and it being obvious\r\n    that there is no ground on your part for discouragement in the\r\n    progress you are making, and my passion being local self-government\r\n    and the determination by the great communities into which this\r\n    nation is organized of their own policy and life, I can only say\r\n    that since you turned away from me as a leader of a Party and asked\r\n    me my position as a man, I am obliged to state it very frankly, and\r\n    I believe that in stating it I am probably in agreement with those\r\n    who framed the platform to which allusion has been made.\r\n\r\n    I think that very few persons, perhaps, realize the difficulty and\r\n    the dual duty that must be exercised, whether he will or not, by a\r\n    President of the United States. He is President of the United States\r\n    as an executive charged with the administration of the law, but he\r\n    is the choice of a Party as a leader in policy. The policy is\r\n    determined by the Party, or else upon unusual and new circumstances\r\n    by the determination of those who lead the Party. This is my\r\n    situation as an individual. I have told you that I believed that the\r\n    best way of settling this thing and the best considered principles\r\n    of the Constitution with regard to it, is that it should be settled\r\n    by the States. I am very much obliged to you.\r\n\r\n    The President paused. He looked relieved. There was a moment’s\r\n    silence, and then Mrs. Dorr said:\r\n\r\n    “May I ask you this question? Is it not a fact that we have very\r\n    good precedents existing for altering the electorate by\r\n    Constitutional Amendment?”\r\n\r\n    The President’s face changed. “I do not think,” he said, “that that\r\n    has anything to do with my conviction as to the best way that it\r\n    could be done.”\r\n\r\n    “It has not,” agreed Mrs. Dorr, “but it leaves room for the women of\r\n    the country to say what they want through the Constitution of the\r\n    United States.”\r\n\r\n    “Certainly it does,” the President said hastily, “there is good\r\n    room. But I have stated my conviction. I have no right to criticize\r\n    the opinions of those who have different convictions and I certainly\r\n    would not wish to do so.”\r\n\r\n    Mrs. Wiley stepped forward. “Granted that it is a State matter,” she\r\n    said, “would it not give this great movement an impetus if the\r\n    Resolution now pending before Congress were passed?”\r\n\r\n    “But the Resolution is for an Amendment to the Constitution,” the\r\n    President objected.\r\n\r\n    “The States would have to pass upon it before it became an\r\n    Amendment,” said Mrs. Wiley. “Would it not be a State matter then?”\r\n\r\n    “Yes,” the President interrupted, “but by a very different process,\r\n    for by that process it would be forced upon the minority; they would\r\n    have to accept it.”\r\n\r\n    “They could reject it if they wished to,” said Mrs. Dorr.\r\n    “Three-fourths of the States would have to pass it.”\r\n\r\n    “Yes,” the President said, with distinct annoyance, “but the other\r\n    fourth could not reject it.”\r\n\r\n    “Mr. President,” said Mrs. Dorr, “don’t you think that when the\r\n    Constitution was framed it was agreed that when three-fourths of the\r\n    States wanted a reform, the other fourth should accept it also?”\r\n\r\n    The President was plainly disconcerted. He stepped back.\r\n\r\n    “I cannot say,” he replied frigidly, “what was agreed upon. I can\r\n    only say that I have tried to answer your question, and I do not\r\n    think it is quite proper that I submit myself to cross-examination.”\r\n\r\n    “Very well,” Mrs. Dorr said quietly. “We will not cross-examine you\r\n    further.”\r\n\r\n    “Thank you, Mr. President,” said Mrs. Wiley, “for your courtesy in\r\n    receiving us.”\r\n\r\n    The President bowed. “I am very much obliged to you,” he said. “It\r\n    has been a very pleasant occasion.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the _Suffragist_ Lucy Burns said editorially:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The President has told a deputation of club women that they must win\r\n    political freedom from State Legislatures; but not from him, not\r\n    from Congress.\r\n\r\n    This position is obvious pretense. The national government has the\r\n    power, granted it by the constitution, to enfranchise women. It has,\r\n    therefore, the duty of doing so, if women’s claim to enfranchisement\r\n    is just.\r\n\r\n    The President knows as well as we do the enormous difficulty of\r\n    winning the vote by amending the Constitution of thirty-nine\r\n    different States. It is amazing that a man can be found who will\r\n    calmly direct women to take up this great burden when men are\r\n    responsible for their need. Men alone, in all but ten States, have\r\n    the power to change our laws. The good or evil of these laws is\r\n    their praise or blame. It is a public injustice today that men deny\r\n    to women in the ballot a means of self-protection which they are\r\n    glad to possess themselves. Men are ethically on the\r\n    defensive—particularly the men, or group of men, who from time to\r\n    time monopolize political power. For the President of the United\r\n    States, who incorporates in himself the power of the whole nation,\r\n    and who is, therefore, more responsible than any other person today\r\n    for the subjugation of women, to declare that he washes his hands of\r\n    their whole case, is to presume upon greater ignorance among women\r\n    than he will find they possess.\r\n\r\n    Nevertheless, we are specifically informed by the President that it\r\n    is “not proper” for us to “cross-examine” him on the grounds of his\r\n    refusal to help us.\r\n\r\n    Only fitfully do women realize the astounding arrogance of their\r\n    rulers.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd later:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Some few curious commentaries cropped up editorially. Under the\r\n    caption, “Heckling the President,” the _New York Times_ says: “It\r\n    certainly was not proper. The President of the United States is not\r\n    to be heckled or hectored or made a defendant.... To catechise him\r\n    when he had finished his speech to them is a thing never done by\r\n    similar delegations of men.”\r\n\r\n    The _Times_ has not grasped the fact that no similar delegation of\r\n    men is possible. Men approach their own representative. If he\r\n    disagrees with them, they have a legitimate remedy in their own\r\n    hands, and can choose another representative at a duly appointed\r\n    time. Women approach the President as members of a disfranchised\r\n    class. The President does not represent them. He bears no\r\n    constitutional relation to them whatever. If the President rejects\r\n    their appeal, they have no legal means of redress. If they may not\r\n    question the President on the justice of his refusal to help them,\r\n    cannot question him gently and reasonably as they did—their position\r\n    is indeed a subservient one.\r\n\r\n    And who told the _Times_ that men never question the President\r\n    “after he had finished his speech to them?” While the Tariff Bill\r\n    was before Congress, representatives of men’s interests argued with\r\n    him for hours. But they were men, and voters.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn January 6, 1915, another deputation—the eighth—of one hundred and\r\nfifty Democratic women appeared before the President. Mrs. George A.\r\nArmes, President of the Association of the National Democratic Women of\r\nAmerica, introduced the speakers, Alberta Hill and Dr. Frances G. Van\r\nGasken. He greeted Miss Hill with marked cordiality and listened\r\nattentively as she briefly and with great earnestness pointed out that,\r\nwhile the Federal Government protected men in the exercise of\r\ncitizenship throughout the United States, a woman lost her right to vote\r\nwhen she crossed the line from a Suffrage to a non-Suffrage State. Miss\r\nHill read the following extracts from the speech delivered by Mr. Wilson\r\non the occasion of the formation of the Wilson and Marshall League at\r\nSpring Lake, New Jersey, two months after his nomination.\r\n\r\n\r\n    When the last word is said about politics, it is merely the life of\r\n    all of us from the point of view of what can be accomplished by\r\n    legislation and the administration of public offices. I think it is\r\n    artificial to divide life up into sections: it is all of one piece\r\n    though you can’t attend to all pieces of it at once.\r\n\r\n    And so when the women, who are in so many respects at the heart of\r\n    life, begin to take an interest in politics, then you know that all\r\n    the lines of sympathy and intelligence and comprehension are going\r\n    to be interlaced in a way which they have never been interlaced\r\n    before; so that our politics will be of the same pattern with our\r\n    life. This, it seems to me, is devoutly to be wished.\r\n\r\n    And so when the women come into politics, they come in to show us\r\n    all those little contacts between life and politics, on account of\r\n    which I, for myself, rejoice that they have come to our assistance;\r\n    they will be as indispensable as they are delightful.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe President listened with close attention, a smile quivering at the\r\ncorners of his mouth. As she concluded, a ripple of amusement ran around\r\nthe circle of auditors, and the President laughed outright.\r\n\r\n“I cannot argue as well as you can,” he told Miss Hill with evident\r\nenjoyment. He said further:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I am most unaffectedly complimented by this visit that you have paid\r\n    me. I have been called on several times to say what my position is\r\n    in the very important matter that you are so deeply interested in. I\r\n    want to say that nobody can look on the fight you are making without\r\n    great admiration, and I certainly am one of those who admire the\r\n    tenacity and the skill and the address with which you try to promote\r\n    the matter that you are interested in.\r\n\r\n    But I, ladies, am tied to a conviction which I have had all my life\r\n    that changes of this sort ought to be brought about State by State.\r\n    If it were not a matter of female Suffrage, if it were a matter of\r\n    any other thing connected with Suffrage, I would hold the same\r\n    opinion. It is a long standing and deeply matured conviction on my\r\n    part and therefore I would be without excuse to my own\r\n    constitutional principles if I lend my support to this very\r\n    important movement for an amendment to the Constitution of the\r\n    United States.\r\n\r\n    Frankly I do not think that this is the wise or the permanent way to\r\n    build. I know that perhaps you unanimously disagree with me but you\r\n    will not think the less of me for being perfectly frank in the\r\n    avowal of my own convictions on that subject; and certainly that\r\n    avowal writes no attitude of antagonism, but merely an attitude of\r\n    principle.\r\n\r\n    I want to say again how much complimented I am by your call and also\r\n    by the confidence that you have so generously expressed in me, Mrs.\r\n    Armes. I hope that in some respect I may live to justify that\r\n    confidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  VIII\r\n\r\n                 THE STRUGGLE WITH THE RULES COMMITTEE\r\n\r\n\r\nWE now return to the work in Congress. Again it is necessary to go back\r\ninto history a few months.\r\n\r\nAll these months, the work of organizing the nation-wide demonstration\r\nof May 2—which had been decided upon at the opening meeting of the\r\nCongressional Union for 1914—had been going on.\r\n\r\nThe Congressional Union sent organizers into all the States of the Union\r\nto make plans for the demonstration. Minnie E. Brooke went through every\r\nState in the South. Mabel Vernon, one of the organizers for the\r\nCongressional Union, traveled through the southwestern part of the\r\ncountry and up through California, ending her trip in Nevada. Crystal\r\nEastman of the Executive Committee took care of the Northwestern States,\r\nEmma Smith DeVoe covered the Far Western States; Jessie Hardy Stubbs,\r\nthe Middle Western States; Mrs. Lawrence Lewis and Alice Paul, assisted\r\nby Olive Hasbrouck, New England and the Middle Atlantic States.\r\n\r\nOn February 12, the National American Woman Suffrage Association\r\npromised its co-operation also, and from that date aided in making the\r\ndemonstration a success.\r\n\r\nThe demonstration—taking the form of parades in most cases, meetings in\r\na few—occurred in at least one great city in every State. The following\r\nresolution was adopted at the various gatherings.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Resolved, that this meeting calls upon Congress to take immediate\r\n    and favorable action upon the Bristow-Mondell Resolution\r\n    enfranchising women.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe culminating demonstration occurred May 9 in Washington. There was a\r\nmass-meeting at the Belasco Theatre, and following this a procession\r\nstarting promptly at three o’clock, marched to the Capitol. At the foot\r\nof the Capitol steps, the enormous gathering sang the _Woman’s March_.\r\nThen five hundred and thirty-one delegates representing every\r\nCongressional and Senatorial district in the country, bearing\r\nresolutions passed at the country-wide demonstrations, marched up the\r\nlong steps into the great Rotunda of the Capitol. A Committee of\r\nSenators and Representatives awaited the delegates, received the\r\nresolutions and introduced them on the floor of each House of Congress.\r\n\r\nHere, as always, Alice Paul visualized her work in pageantry. On this\r\noccasion, that pageantry was particularly beautiful. Zona Gale writes in\r\nthe _Suffragist_:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “I shall watch it, but it will not mean anything to me,” said a\r\n    visitor to me on Saturday, but that night she said: “I leaned out of\r\n    my window, and held my screen up with one hand, and let the sun beat\r\n    in my face for the forty minutes that you were passing, and I wept.\r\n    To think of your being part of it—and caring like that—and the men\r\n    there on the sidewalk holding back, _by what right_, what you ask!”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe effect of this lengthened—and therefore accumulative—nation-wide\r\ndemonstration was immediately felt at the national Capitol. Between the\r\ndates of the demonstration throughout the States May 2, and the\r\ndemonstration in Washington, May 9, the Judiciary Committee reported the\r\nMondell Resolution without recommendation, but with an overwhelming\r\nvote, to the House. This marked an epoch in the Suffrage work in the\r\nUnited States; for Suffrage had never been debated on the floor of the\r\nHouse, and not since 1890 had it progressed beyond the Committee stage\r\nin the House. The Resolution rested on May 5 at the foot of the highly\r\ncongested House calendar. On May 13, Representative Mondell introduced a\r\nResolution asking time for an early consideration of the Suffrage\r\nAmendment. The adoption of this Resolution meant that the Amendment\r\nwould be taken up, debated, and voted on.\r\n\r\nThe Rules Committee, to which the Resolution was referred, failed to act\r\nupon it. Suffragists began to besiege the Rules Committee. The Rules\r\nCommittee, however, proved unamenable to argument, discussion, or\r\nentreaty.\r\n\r\nLater in the year, in a speech at the Newport Conference, Lucy Burns\r\nsaid of the Rules Committee that it “adopted devious means for avoiding\r\naction on the Suffrage Resolution. It was difficult for them to vote\r\nagainst it, and it seemed difficult for them to vote for it. They\r\napparently decided that the best policy for them to pursue was to take\r\nno action at all, so they hit upon the happy expedient of holding no\r\nmeetings whatever.”\r\n\r\nA detailed account of the action of the Rules Committee proves the\r\nadamancy of Party control. It gives some idea of the obstacles which\r\ningenious politicians can put in the way of citizens, even though those\r\ncitizens are making a perfectly legitimate request.\r\n\r\nMr. Henry, the Chairman of the Rules Committee, had declared in the\r\nspring that he thought it was out of the power of his Committee to take\r\naction (i.e. on the matter of the Suffrage Resolution _which was only to\r\nallot time in the House for the discussion of the Suffrage Amendment_)\r\nsince the Suffrage Amendment had not been favorably acted upon at the\r\nlast Democratic Caucus: “You may tell this to the Press. You may tell it\r\nto the newspapers,” Mr. Henry said; “my hands are tied.”\r\n\r\nHowever, early in June, the _Suffragist_ says, “Mr. Henry’s view of his\r\npolitical helplessness weakened slightly.” He promised to report out the\r\nSuffrage Resolution. But he could not be prevailed upon to state when he\r\nwould do so. The Congressional Union, therefore, organized a series of\r\ndeputations which visited the Rules Committee during all the long, hot\r\nsummer and the long, hot fall. Deputations from nearly every State in\r\nthe Union and from nearly every occupation and profession of women\r\nwaited upon the members of the Rules Committee. The reader must remember\r\nalways that they were asking—not that the Amendment be passed—only that\r\na few hours be set aside for the discussion of the Suffrage question in\r\nthe House of Representatives. Repeated deputations called upon\r\nindividual members of the Committee. On June 10, the Committee met, but\r\ndecided to postpone action on the Suffrage question till July 1. Mr.\r\nHenry left immediately for Texas. A large deputation came to Washington\r\nto be present at the July 1 meeting. Many of the most prominent members\r\nof the Club women’s Deputation of five hundred, who had called the\r\nafternoon of June 30 on the President, remained in Washington overnight,\r\nso that they might be present at the meeting.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, they arrived at the Committee room, they were told that\r\nthe Committee would not meet, although no notice had been given of any\r\nchange of date of the meeting. Mr. Henry had not returned to Washington.\r\nThere was a quorum of the Committee in town; but the Democratic members\r\nsaid that they were bound by a “gentlemen’s agreement” among themselves\r\nnot to meet. August 1 was set for the next meeting.\r\n\r\nOn July 13, a deputation of more than a hundred members of the\r\nCongressional Union, led by Alice Paul, Lucy Burns, and Mrs. Gilson\r\nGardner, called upon the individual members of the Rules Committee. They\r\nasked each member to sign a petition requesting the Acting Chairman, Mr.\r\nPou, to call the Committee together for the purpose of reporting out the\r\nResolution on the Suffrage Amendment. This petition was signed by the\r\ntwo Republican members of the Committee in Washington, and the one\r\nProgressive member. The two Democratic members then in Washington\r\nrefused to sign. The petition was presented to Mr. Pou in his office by\r\nRepresentative Mondell.\r\n\r\nMr. Pou rose from his chair, viewing with amazement the numbers of the\r\ndeputation as they filed into the room till all available space was\r\noccupied, leaving the majority of their number in the corridor. Mr. Pou\r\ndefinitely declined to call the meeting, although a quorum of the\r\nCommittee was in the city, and although all of the Republican members on\r\nthe Committee and the Progressive member had requested a meeting. Mr.\r\nPou stated that he was bound by a “gentleman’s agreement” entered into\r\nby the Democratic members to hold no meetings of the Committee before\r\nAugust 1. He said, “The Democratic members agreed not to hold any\r\nmeetings until August 1. In view of that understanding, I would not feel\r\nat liberty to call the Committee together.... When the Republicans were\r\nin charge, they decided what they were going to do; now that we are in\r\ncharge, we decide what we are going to do.”\r\n\r\nOn August 1, a deputation consisting of Lucy Burns and Mrs. Gilson\r\nGardner from the Congressional Union accompanied by Maude F. Clark,\r\ncalled upon Mr. Pou. The forthright Lucy Burns began. “Mr. Pou, today is\r\nthe first day of August. You told us when a Committee of our\r\nOrganization called upon you in July that the Democratic members of the\r\nCommittee had a ‘gentlemen’s agreement’ not to hold a meeting until\r\nAugust 1. Now that the day has come we should be glad to know when a\r\nmeeting of your Committee will be held to consider House Resolution 514,\r\nallotting time for the consideration of the Suffrage Amendment in the\r\nHouse.”\r\n\r\nMr. Pou informed the delegation that Mr. Henry, Chairman of the Rules\r\nCommittee, would return to Washington on Monday, August 3, and that a\r\nmeeting of the Committee would be called for that day. Among other\r\nthings, Mr. Pou made the significant statement, “The Rules Committee has\r\nin its keeping the policy of the Democratic Party in Congress.”\r\n\r\nOn August 3, a second delegation from the Congressional Union,\r\nconsisting of Alice Paul, Lucy Burns, Mrs. Gilson Gardner, Dr. Clara E.\r\nLudlow, went to attend the promised meeting at the office of the\r\nChairman, Mr. Henry. The elusive Mr. Henry was at last visible in the\r\nflesh. He informed these women that no meeting of the Committee had been\r\ncalled for that day. He did not know when it would be called, nor what\r\nmeasures it would consider. He suggested that they call again in a few\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nOn August 28, the Rules Committee finally met. A deputation from the\r\nCongressional Union presented themselves at the door. The deputation\r\nconsisted of Mrs. Gilson Gardner, Minnie E. Brooke, Mrs. S. B. McDuffie,\r\nVirginia Arnold.\r\n\r\nAt the door of the Committee room, Mr. Henry’s secretary declared that\r\nit would be impossible for him to take a message or a card to Mr. Henry.\r\n\r\n“I should be glad, then,” said the gently diplomatic Mrs. Gardner, “to\r\nsend a card to other members of the Committee.”\r\n\r\n“The Chairman has given orders,” said the secretary, “that no messages\r\nmay be sent in to the Committee room.”\r\n\r\n“I quite understand,” said Mrs. Gardner, “that Mr. Henry can speak for\r\nthe majority members of the Committee, but surely not for the Republican\r\nand Progressive members, and I should like your permission to send word\r\nin to one of them.”\r\n\r\nThe secretary maintained that this was against Mr. Henry’s specific\r\norders.\r\n\r\nMrs. Gardner then went on very gently: “It is not the desire of the\r\ndeputation to disturb the Committee; but, on the other hand, it is the\r\nsense of the deputation that it is necessary to send the Committee a\r\nmessage. What would you suggest that we do?”\r\n\r\nThe secretary considered and decreed, “A message might be sent in by\r\ntelephone.” Mrs. Gardner accepted the use of Mr. Henry’s desk telephone,\r\ncalled up Representative Kelly who was attending the meeting in the\r\nadjoining Committee room, and asked if he would bring the Suffrage\r\nResolution to the attention of the Committee. Mr. Kelly promptly\r\npromised to call up the Suffrage Resolution if it were possible to do\r\nso. This colloquy effectively brought the matter before the Committee.\r\n\r\nThe Suffrage Resolution was brought up, but a substitute motion that the\r\nCommittee adjourn was immediately made and carried. It was a tie vote,\r\nbut Mr. Henry, as chairman, cast the deciding vote. The Committee\r\naccordingly adjourned without having taken action on the Suffrage\r\nResolution.\r\n\r\nThe Congressional Union, undaunted, maintained its siege of the Rules\r\nCommittee until Congress adjourned in October. Throughout the remaining\r\nmonths of that Congressional Session, however, the Rules Committee\r\ncontinued its policy of evasion. No action was taken before adjournment.\r\n\r\nOf course, all this blocking of their efforts on the part of the\r\nDemocrats made inevitable the election policy which the Congressional\r\nUnion was about to adopt—that of holding them “responsible.”\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   IX\r\n\r\n                  THE FIRST APPEAL TO THE WOMEN VOTERS\r\n\r\n\r\nIN the meantime, the Congressional Union had been forming an Advisory\r\nCouncil which continued to Support the Congressional Union—and later the\r\nWoman’s Party—with advice and work during the rest of its history. The\r\npersonnel of the Advisory Council has changed from time to time; but\r\nalways it has been a large body and an able one.\r\n\r\nThe list of membership has included many famous names; women political\r\nleaders; women trades-unionists; women of wealth and position; women\r\nactive in their communities. It included professional women of every\r\nsort; doctors, lawyers, clergymen. It included artists of every\r\ndescription; actors, singers, painters, sculptors. It included\r\npublicists of every kind; fictionists, poets, dramatists, essayists. It\r\nincluded social workers of every class. And these women have represented\r\nall parts of the Union.\r\n\r\nOn August 29 and 30, this newly-formed Advisory Council met at Newport.\r\nMrs. O. H. P. Belmont did everything to make the occasion a success. She\r\nthrew open Marble House which, hung with the great purple, white, and\r\ngold banners of the Congressional Union and flooded with golden light,\r\nmade an extraordinary background for the deliberations of the\r\nConference. In every way possible for her she used the beauty and social\r\nprestige of Newport to give the occasion dignity, prominence, and\r\npublicity. Her daughter, the Duchess of Marlborough, had joined the\r\nCongressional Union just previous to this Conference. Little she thought\r\nand little the Congressional Union thought that as an English woman, she\r\nwould be a voter, would be elected to the London City Council before her\r\nmother, an American woman, was enfranchised.\r\n\r\nHere, for the first time, the plan of holding the Democratic Party—the\r\nParty in power—responsible for the slowness with which the Suffrage work\r\nwas progressing, and, in consequence, of working against it, was adopted\r\nas a program actually to be carried out.\r\n\r\nLucy Burns made a magnificent speech on that occasion. She pointed out\r\nthat the Democratic Party was in complete possession of the National\r\nGovernment, controlling the Presidential chair, the Senate, possessing\r\nan overwhelming majority in the House. She analyzed the working of\r\nCongress: she showed that our government is a government by Party: that\r\nno measures of importance had passed through the Sixty-third Congress\r\nwithout the backing of the Party in power: and that no measure could\r\npass that Congress if opposed by that Party.\r\n\r\nShe amplified this thesis. She showed that the President, the leader of\r\nthe Party, had seven times refused his powerful aid to the movement. She\r\nshowed that in the Senate the Democratic leaders blocked the Suffrage\r\nmeasure by bringing it to a vote at a time when they acknowledged it\r\nwould be defeated. She showed that in the House, the Rules Committee had\r\nconsistently blocked the Amendment, both by preventing the creation of a\r\nSuffrage Committee and by preventing consideration of the Amendment in\r\nthe House. And she proved by the words of the acting chairman of the\r\nRules Committee that that Committee had in its keeping “the policy of\r\nthe Democratic Party.” She showed that the Democratic Caucus had taken\r\ndefinite action against the Suffrage Amendment. It had declared that\r\nSuffrage was not a question for national consideration and so it had\r\nrefused to sanction the creation of a Suffrage Committee.\r\n\r\nAlice Paul, first asking the press to withdraw, outlined the proposed\r\nelection program. She asked the members of the Conference not to reveal\r\nit until the middle of September when the Congressional Union would be\r\nready to put it into practical operation. This is her speech on that\r\noccasion:\r\n\r\n\r\n    From the very beginning of our work in Washington, we have followed\r\n    one consistent policy from which we have not departed a single\r\n    moment. We began our work with the coming in of the present Congress\r\n    and immediately went to the Party which was in control of the\r\n    situation and asked it to act. We determined to get the Amendment\r\n    through the Sixty-third Congress, or to make it very clear who had\r\n    kept it from going through. Now, as has been shown, the Democrats\r\n    have been in control of all branches of the Government and they are\r\n    therefore responsible for the non-passage of our measure.\r\n\r\n    The point is first, who is our enemy and then, how shall that enemy\r\n    be attacked?\r\n\r\n    We are all, I think, agreed that it is the Democratic Party which is\r\n    responsible for the blocking of the Suffrage Amendment. Again and\r\n    again that Party has gone on record through the action of its\r\n    leaders, its caucus, and its committees so that an impregnable case\r\n    has been built up against it. We now lay before you a plan to meet\r\n    the present situation.\r\n\r\n    We propose going into the nine Suffrage States and appealing to the\r\n    women to use their votes to secure the franchise for the women of\r\n    the rest of the country. All of these years we have worked primarily\r\n    in the States. Now the time has come, we believe, when we can really\r\n    go into national politics and use the nearly four million votes that\r\n    we have to win the vote for the rest of us. Now that we have four\r\n    million voters, we need no longer continue to make our appeal simply\r\n    to the men. The struggle in England has gotten down to a physical\r\n    fight. Here our fight is simply a political one. The question is\r\n    whether we are good enough politicians to take four million votes\r\n    and organize them and use them so as to win the vote for the women\r\n    who are still disfranchised.\r\n\r\n    We want to attempt to organize the women’s vote. Our plan is to go\r\n    out to these nine States and there appeal to all the women voters to\r\n    withdraw their support from the Democrats nationally until the\r\n    Democratic Party nationally ceases to block Suffrage. We would issue\r\n    an appeal signed by influential women of the East addressed to the\r\n    women voters as a whole asking them to use their vote this one time\r\n    in the national election against the Democratic Party throughout the\r\n    whole nine States. Every one of these States, with one exception, is\r\n    a doubtful State. Going back over a period of fourteen years, each\r\n    State, except Utah, has supported first one Party and then another.\r\n    Here are nine States which politicians are thinking about and in\r\n    these nine States we have this great power. If we ask those women in\r\n    the nine Suffrage States as a group to withhold their support from\r\n    this Party as a group which is opposing us, it will mean that votes\r\n    will be turned. Suppose the Party saw votes falling away all over\r\n    the country because of their action on the Trust question—they would\r\n    change their attitude on Trust legislation. If they see them falling\r\n    away because of their attitude on Suffrage they will change their\r\n    attitude on Suffrage. When we have once affected the result in a\r\n    national election, no Party will trifle with Suffrage any longer.\r\n\r\n    We, of course, are a little body to undertake this—but we have to\r\n    begin. We have not very much money; there are not many of us to go\r\n    out against the great Democratic Party. Perhaps this time we won’t\r\n    be able to do so very much, though I know we can do a great deal,\r\n    but if the Party leaders see that some votes have been turned they\r\n    will know that we have at least realized this power that we possess\r\n    and they will know that by 1916 we will have it organized. The mere\r\n    announcement of the fact that Suffragists of the East have gone out\r\n    to the West with this appeal will be enough to make every man in\r\n    Congress sit up and take notice.\r\n\r\n    This last week one Congressman from a Suffrage State came to us and\r\n    asked us if we would write just one letter to say what he had done\r\n    in Congress to help us. He said that one letter might determine the\r\n    election in his district. This week the man who is running for the\r\n    Senatorial election in another Suffrage State came to us and asked\r\n    us to go out and help him in his State—asked us simply to announce\r\n    that he had been our friend. Now if our help is valued to this\r\n    extent, our opposition will be feared in like degree.\r\n\r\n    Our plan is this: To send at least two women to each of those nine\r\n    States. We would put one woman at the center who would attend to the\r\n    organizing, the publicity and the distribution of literature. We\r\n    would have literature printed showing what the Democratic Party has\r\n    done with regard to Suffrage in the Sixty-third Congress. We would\r\n    have leaflets printed from the Eastern women appealing to the\r\n    Western women for help, and we would have leaflets issued showing\r\n    how much the enfranchised woman herself needs the Federal Amendment\r\n    because most important matters are becoming national in their\r\n    organization and can only be dealt with by national legislation. We\r\n    could reach every home in every one of those nine States with our\r\n    literature, without very great expense. One good woman at the center\r\n    could make this message, this appeal from Eastern women, known to\r\n    the whole State. The other worker would attend to the speaking and\r\n    in six weeks could easily cover all the large towns of the State.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHY IS THE GIRL FROM THE WEST GETTING ALL THE ATTENTION?\r\nNina Allender in _The Suffragist_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n    This is the plan that we are considering, and that we are hoping to\r\n    put through. We would be very much interested to hear what you think\r\n    about it and want, of course, to have your co-operation in carrying\r\n    it through.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Conference voted to unite behind the Bristow-Mondell Amendment in\r\nCongress and to support an active election campaign against candidates\r\nof the Democratic Party. It raised over seven thousand dollars to meet\r\nthe expense of this campaign.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe details of the election campaign project were immediately worked\r\nout; organizers were selected and after a farewell garden party on\r\nSeptember 14, they started for the nine enfranchised States.\r\nHeadquarters were opened in San Francisco under Lucy Burns and Rose\r\nWinslow; in Denver, Colorado, under Doris Stevens and Ruth Noyes; in\r\nPhœnix, Arizona, under Jane Pincus and Josephine Casey; in Kansas City,\r\nKansas, under Lola C. Trax and Edna S. Latimer; at Portland, Oregon,\r\nunder Jessie Hardy Stubbs and Virginia Arnold; in Seattle, Washington,\r\nunder Margaret Whittemore and Anne McCue; at Cheyenne, Wyoming, under\r\nGertrude Hunter; at Salt Lake City, Utah, under Elsie Lancaster; at\r\nBoise City, Idaho, under Helena Hill Weed.\r\n\r\nIn these centers, open-air, drawing-room, and theatre meetings followed\r\neach other in rapid succession. In many districts, the campaigners\r\ncanvassed from door to door. Window-cards, handbills, cartoons,\r\nmoving-picture films, and voiceless speeches, calling upon the women\r\nvoters to refuse their support to the Party which had blocked the\r\nNational Suffrage Amendment, appeared everywhere from Seattle to Phœnix.\r\nA pithily worded _Appeal to the Women Voters_ was placed in the hands of\r\nthe women voters. Press bulletins describing the campaign against the\r\nDemocratic candidates for Congress and reiterating the record made by\r\nthe Democratic Party on the Suffrage question, were issued daily.\r\nLiterature dealing with the record of the Democratic Party and with the\r\nvalue to the woman voter of a national Suffrage Amendment, were sent to\r\ninnumerable homes in every Suffrage State.\r\n\r\nThe _Suffragist_, which teemed with reports of what these vigorous\r\ncampaigners were doing, presents pictures which could have occurred\r\nnowhere in the world but the United States, and nowhere in the United\r\nStates but the West. The speakers were interesting, amusing, full of\r\ninformation and enthusiasm. With a sympathy and understanding typically\r\nwestern, men and women responded immediately, responded equally to this\r\noriginal campaign.\r\n\r\nAll the time, of course, these speakers were educating the people of the\r\nUnited States in regard to the work of Congress. This was a new note in\r\nSuffrage campaigns; but it was the policy of the Congressional Union at\r\nall times whether campaigns were being waged or not.\r\n\r\nFrom the _Suffragist_ of September 19, I quote from a report of the\r\nenterprising Jessie Hardy Stubbs, who actually began her work on board\r\nthe North Coast, Limited:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Here we are—all bound for the field of battle. Miss McCue, Miss\r\n    Whittemore and I are together. Miss Whittemore joined us at Chicago\r\n    full of earnestness and zeal. We have put up signs in each car that\r\n    there will be a meeting tonight in the observation car, and that we\r\n    will speak on the record of the Democratic Party in Congress and\r\n    Women Suffrage. There is much interest. We have sold ten\r\n    _Suffragists_ today on board the train, secured new subscribers to\r\n    the _Suffragist_, and contributions for the campaign.\r\n\r\n\r\nDoris Stevens writes in the _Suffragist_ of October 3:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Friday afternoon, Mrs. Lucius M. Cuthbert, a daughter of ex-Senator\r\n    Hill, gave us a drawing-room meeting in her beautiful Denver home.\r\n    She invited representative women from all Parties to come and hear\r\n    of the work of the Union, to which invitation about one hundred\r\n    women responded. One Democratic lady came up to me after the meeting\r\n    and said, “I had no idea you women had been so rebuffed by my Party.\r\n    I am convinced that my duty is to the women first, and my Party\r\n    second.” Another: “You have almost convinced me that we women must\r\n    stand together on this national issue.” And so it went. And, as our\r\n    charming hostess pointed out, the applause was often led by a\r\n    prominent Democratic woman. Offers of help, loans of furniture, and\r\n    general expressions of eagerness to aid were made on every side. The\r\n    meeting was a splendid success, judging from the large number of\r\n    women who joined the Union and the generous collection which was\r\n    given.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the _Suffragist_ of October 10, Lola Trax writes:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The meeting at Lebanon was especially well advertised. The moving\r\n    picture shows had run an advertising slide; the Wednesday prayer\r\n    meeting had announced my coming, and the Public Schools had also\r\n    made announcements to their pupils. The Ladies’ Aid Society invited\r\n    me to speak in the afternoon, while they were quilting; and thus\r\n    another anti-Suffrage argument was shattered; for quilting and\r\n    politics went hand in hand.\r\n\r\n    At Phillipsburg the meeting was on the Court House green. It is\r\n    fifty-seven miles from Phillipsburg to Osborne and the trip has to\r\n    be made by freight. I was on the road from six-thirty o’clock in the\r\n    morning until three P.M. About a dozen passengers were in the\r\n    caboose on the freight, and we held a meeting and discussion which\r\n    lasted about forty-five minutes. Upon reaching Osborne at three\r\n    o’clock I found about one hundred people assembled for an auction\r\n    sale in the middle of the street. Cots, tables, and chairs were to\r\n    be offered at sacrifice prices. The temptation to hold a meeting\r\n    overcame fatigue. I jumped into an automobile nearby and had a most\r\n    interested crowd until the auctioneer came. I had been unable to\r\n    secure the Town Hall because a troupe of players were making a one\r\n    night stand in the town. The meeting at night was also in the open\r\n    air.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the _Suffragist_ of October 10, Jessie Hardy Stubbs continues:\r\n\r\n\r\n    On Tuesday evening, September 28, I spoke in the Public Library,\r\n    explaining our mission in Oregon. Mr. Arthur L. Moulton, Progressive\r\n    Candidate for Congress from the Third District presided, and made a\r\n    very clever introductory speech. Many questions were asked by\r\n    Democratic women which brought out a spirited defense on the part of\r\n    several of those present. One Democratic woman maintained that it\r\n    would be a most ungrateful position on the part of the Oregon women\r\n    to vote against Chamberlain, who had always been a friend of\r\n    Suffrage, whereupon a distinguished-looking woman arose and said:\r\n    “Oh, no. It would merely be a case of not loving Chamberlain less,\r\n    but of loving Suffrage more.”\r\n\r\n    I spoke before the Sheet Metal Workers’ Union last night, and expect\r\n    to address every union before the campaign is over. There are only\r\n    two women’s unions here; the garment workers and the waitresses. We\r\n    intend to make a canvass of the stores and meet the clerks\r\n    personally and to get into all the factories, as far as possible,\r\n    where women are employed, and urge these western women voters to\r\n    stand by the working women of the East. Tonight we have our first\r\n    open-air meeting.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the _Suffragist_ of October 31, Gertrude Hunter writes of the\r\ncampaign in Wyoming:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The meeting last Saturday night was most encouraging. It was a\r\n    stormy night, and we went in an auto twenty miles from here, through\r\n    snow banks, and every other difficulty to a rally at a branch home.\r\n    This was at Grand Canon, and a strongly Democratic precinct. Every\r\n    one was wildly enthusiastic over the meeting, even the Democratic\r\n    women telling me how much they appreciated our position. We had a\r\n    dance immediately after, and I danced with the voters (male) until\r\n    one-thirty in the morning, when we were all taken to the railroad\r\n    station in a lumber wagon and four-horse team, a distance of a mile\r\n    and a half, and came in on a train at two-thirty A.M. I sold twenty\r\n    _Suffragists_ and could have disposed of more if I had had them with\r\n    me.\r\n\r\n    Thursday, Friday, and Saturday nights we have big meetings\r\n    scheduled.\r\n\r\n    We are now at Egbert on our regular schedule, and in such a\r\n    snowstorm as I never saw before. However, we have had a good morning\r\n    in spite of it.\r\n\r\n    This town is like the others, consisting of a station, a store, and\r\n    post-office. Not a residence in the place. The people all drove from\r\n    miles around in a high wind and most unfavorable weather to attend\r\n    the meeting.\r\n\r\n    We had the thirty-five mile drive to make to a neighboring town for\r\n    another meeting and we did it every mile through a high wind and\r\n    torrents of rain, that flooded the trail with water, as we went over\r\n    prairie and plowed fields. We did it, however, with only one\r\n    blow-out, and two very narrow escapes from being completely turned\r\n    over, getting in at two this morning.\r\n\r\n    Tomorrow night I shall go to Campstool, where there is a big supper\r\n    and dance.\r\n\r\n    I had another very interesting meeting this week at a town fifty\r\n    miles from here. The “town” consists of a station, the post-office,\r\n    general store, and a little restaurant; no houses, and only one or\r\n    two families living there. The meeting was in the schoolhouse and\r\n    the voters came from miles and miles to attend, at least one hundred\r\n    and fifty of them, on horseback, in wagons, buggies, and autos.\r\n    Every one was much interested. The minister, at whose house I was\r\n    entertained for the afternoon, lived two and one-half miles out in\r\n    the country, said afterward that the meeting was a thrill to most of\r\n    them, who had never heard a Suffrage speech in their lives.\r\n\r\n    These are the solid voters of the community. Many are from the\r\n    eastern States who are homesteading here. I distributed the\r\n    literature to every one.\r\n\r\n    I will probably reach the same number of voters every day this week,\r\n    or perhaps a few more, as the next town we are going into, Burns, is\r\n    a trifle larger than Hillsdale.\r\n\r\n    Miss Brandeis is going from house to house in Cheyenne, distributing\r\n    our literature and soliciting memberships.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe campaign over, four of these victorious campaigners were welcomed\r\nhome on the afternoon of November 15, by an enormous audience at the\r\nColumbia Theatre in Washington:\r\n\r\nMrs. Latimer said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The very first thing they said to us in Kansas was, “Well, you are a\r\n    long way from home!” and we thought so too.\r\n\r\n    Kansas, as you know, is a very large State and is an agricultural\r\n    State, and the consequence was that we had to get in touch with all\r\n    the farmers and so it was necessary for us to do a great deal of\r\n    traveling.\r\n\r\n    After we had established our Headquarters we interviewed the _Kansas\r\n    City Star_, one of the largest papers in the State. After we had\r\n    talked with the associate editor and told him what our plan was,\r\n    that we intended to send a daily bulletin to the eight hundred and\r\n    eight papers in the State of Kansas, that we were going to every one\r\n    of the large towns in the State of Kansas, and have just as many\r\n    meetings as possible, and that we would distribute fifty thousand\r\n    pieces of literature, he looked at us and said, “Do you realize that\r\n    this will take eight men and eighteen stenographers?” I said,\r\n    “Possibly, but two women are going to do it.” And two women did do\r\n    it. The result of that interview was a two and a half column\r\n    editorial on the editorial page of the _Star_. It was the first time\r\n    that an interview with a woman had ever appeared on the editorial\r\n    page, and they told us that even Mr. Bryan had not received two and\r\n    a half columns on that page. All of our bulletins were very well\r\n    published after the _Kansas City Star_ had taken up our cause. The\r\n    women of Kansas co-operated with us, and the Progressives and\r\n    Republicans invited us to speak at their big rallies. Strange as it\r\n    may seem no one seemed to think we were on the wrong track but the\r\n    Democrats.\r\n\r\n    After we had been there for a while we found that the main contest\r\n    was the Senatorial fight, and so we figured out just how we could\r\n    keep Mr. Neely out of the Senate. Every one said that as Mr. Murdock\r\n    was running as a Progressive, and Mr. Curtis as a Republican, it\r\n    would divide the vote and give the victory to the Democratic Party.\r\n    We knew that Mr. Neely had received a very large vote from his own\r\n    district when he ran for Congress—over four thousand majority. So we\r\n    made up our minds that the thing to do was to reduce the vote in his\r\n    own district. We thought that this would help to defeat Mr. Neely,\r\n    and it did. He received from his own district a majority of only\r\n    eight hundred; that is, the Democratic majority went down to eight\r\n    hundred from four thousand. In many of the other districts, his\r\n    majority was still lower. Mr. Taggart, who had a three thousand\r\n    majority two years ago, went down to three hundred, and Miss Trax\r\n    was largely responsible for that. We have letters from many of the\r\n    leading politicians of Kansas saying that our work has been most\r\n    effective. We have felt all through Kansas that our work was very\r\n    encouraging.\r\n\r\n    We had many interesting things happen. The second day we were in the\r\n    Seventh District we held seven meetings. Six meetings had been\r\n    planned, but after we reached Dodge City we found there was a\r\n    political meeting in progress out on the prairie and they telephoned\r\n    in and asked one of us to come out there and speak to them. If any\r\n    of you have ever been to Kansas, you know they have schools\r\n    everywhere, though for miles and miles you never see a house and you\r\n    wonder where the children come from to go to the schools. At eleven\r\n    o’clock at night we arrived at the schoolhouse where the meeting was\r\n    held, and found three hundred people waiting to hear a Suffrage\r\n    speech. After the meeting the women came up and said, “That is just\r\n    what we need. We are glad to help the Eastern women, but we do not\r\n    know anything about it. We are so glad you have come to tell us\r\n    these things because we did not know them.”\r\n\r\n    The men in the West feel the same way. When I was waiting for a\r\n    freight train about five o’clock in the morning, a man came up and\r\n    said, “My wife was at your meeting yesterday afternoon, and I\r\n    thought I would tell you that I have voted the Democratic ticket for\r\n    forty years, but I have voted it the last time.” That is the spirit\r\n    of the men. Because they respect their women out there, they do not\r\n    like to feel that the men in the East and the Democratic Party do\r\n    not consider the woman movement. People would come in and say,\r\n    “Well, you are on the right track now,” and that seems to be the\r\n    spirit everywhere in Kansas.\r\n\r\n\r\nMiss Pincus said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I am sorry I cannot come to you with the air of a conquering hero,\r\n    but I am sure that any person who understands the situation in\r\n    Arizona will acknowledge that the purpose of our campaign was\r\n    accomplished. Despite the fact that the Democrats were in\r\n    control—had all the money in the State and owned nearly all the\r\n    newspapers—a Democratic leader came to my office one day and told me\r\n    that the Democrats were absolutely sure that the women of Arizona\r\n    would defeat Smith. He said the Democratic Party was scared to\r\n    death. It was most amusing. Every candidate who was running, even\r\n    for State and County offices, felt it necessary to declare that he\r\n    had always believed in Woman Suffrage, that his mother had believed\r\n    in Woman Suffrage and that his grandmother believed in it. I suppose\r\n    you know what action our friends Senator Smith and Congressman\r\n    Hayden took. Both of them telegraphed from Washington to the\r\n    Democratic State Convention in session at Phœnix and pledged\r\n    themselves absolutely to support national Woman Suffrage. Mr. Hayden\r\n    stood up on the floor of the House and filled three pages of the\r\n    _Congressional Record_ on his attitude on Woman Suffrage and Arizona\r\n    was simply flooded with this copy.\r\n\r\n    The women, we found, were very open to reason, and one thing I had\r\n    not expected to find was how chivalrous all the men were. I have\r\n    never been so overwhelmed with courtesy and chivalry as I was out in\r\n    Arizona. Every candidate from every county came into our\r\n    Headquarters to shake hands and say what a nice day it was and how\r\n    he had always been in favor of Woman Suffrage. Each political Party\r\n    in Arizona claims absolute credit for Woman Suffrage out there. To\r\n    me, coming from a plain campaign State, New York, it was most\r\n    encouraging to find all the men such good Suffragists, and I would\r\n    like to turn all anti-Suffragists into a Suffrage State to let them\r\n    see how women are treated at election time.\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Helena Hill Weed said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I am very glad to be able to report that no Democrat will come to\r\n    the United States Senate or House of Representatives from Idaho—and\r\n    the Congressional Union had a hand in it.\r\n\r\n    We do not claim entire responsibility for the large Republican\r\n    victory, but we do claim the credit for turning many hundreds of\r\n    votes from the Democratic Party. When I reached Idaho I found the\r\n    question simmered down to the Senatorial race. The two candidates\r\n    were Senator Brady, Republican, and ex-Governor Hawley, who was\r\n    running on the Democratic ticket.\r\n\r\n    I began by sending out copies of all of our literature and the\r\n    current number of the _Suffragist_ to every editor, club woman,\r\n    minister, or other person of influence. I began with a meeting which\r\n    was organized by the working women in the hotel where I was\r\n    stopping. I told them of our work and what it meant. Many of the\r\n    women had worked in the East and they knew what conditions were\r\n    among the laboring women there, and they said they never before\r\n    realized that they could do anything to help the women in the East.\r\n    About three days after the meeting a woman came into my office and\r\n    said, “I want to tell you, Mrs. Weed, that that meeting is going to\r\n    bring out at least two hundred Republican votes in my ward which are\r\n    never cast, and is going to turn many more.” I positively could not\r\n    fill the requests that were made to speak and explain the\r\n    Congressional Union policy. Men and women of the labor unions were\r\n    much enthused over our work and we won hundreds and hundreds of\r\n    votes simply because our policy was non-partisan.\r\n\r\n    We put it straight up to Mr. Hawley that an indorsement of President\r\n    Wilson’s administration meant the indorsement of the\r\n    administration’s refusal to allow a discussion and a vote on\r\n    Suffrage. We put it up to him that it made no difference how good a\r\n    Suffragist he personally might be, if he ran on a platform which\r\n    contained, as did his, a blanket indorsement of _all_ of President\r\n    Wilson’s policies, including his refusal to allow a discussion and a\r\n    vote on Suffrage. We pointed out to him that his personal belief in\r\n    Suffrage was of little avail to us if he could not or would not\r\n    bring the Party which he was supporting to cease its hostility to\r\n    our Amendment. We reminded him of the Democratic Congressmen from\r\n    Suffrage States who had sat in the Sixty-third Congress and who had\r\n    professed a deep interest in Suffrage but who had accomplished\r\n    nothing as far as actually bringing Suffrage to pass was concerned,\r\n    because of the continued hostility of the Democratic Party which was\r\n    in control of all branches of the Government. We told him that we\r\n    felt duty bound to make known to the women voters the hostile record\r\n    of his national Party on Woman Suffrage, and to ask them to refuse\r\n    their support to that Party until it ceased blocking our Amendment.\r\n\r\n    They understood the point very quickly and saw that as far as the\r\n    individual was concerned there was nothing to choose from between\r\n    Mr. Hawley and Senator Brady—both were equally good Suffragists, as\r\n    far as their personal stand was concerned. It was only when it came\r\n    to considering their Party affiliations that one could discriminate\r\n    between them. We always emphasized the fact that we were not\r\n    indorsing the Republican, the Progressive, the Socialist, or the\r\n    Prohibition Party, but were merely asking the women to refuse\r\n    support to the Party which had the power to give Suffrage and which\r\n    up to the present had used its power only to block that measure. We\r\n    explained that we would have opposed any of the other Parties, had\r\n    they possessed the power which the Democratic Party possessed, and\r\n    had they used that power in the same obstructive way.\r\n\r\n    I am absolutely sure that the Congressional Union has the right\r\n    policy for us to follow and that through this policy we are going to\r\n    win the passage of the Federal Amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\nIncidentally the referendum in 1914 in Nevada and Montana gave Suffrage\r\nto women.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Congressional Union never deviated from its policy of\r\ndevoting itself to the Federal Amendment, yet it was deeply interested\r\nin the success of these referendum campaigns and gave aid when it seemed\r\nneeded. The Congressional Union sent Mabel Vernon, a national organizer,\r\nto help in the Nevada campaign. At the close of the campaign an\r\nenthusiastic audience welcomed Mabel Vernon home.\r\n\r\nMiss Vernon said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    In the West they do not have the feeling that Suffrage is an old,\r\n    old story. They were very willing to go to a Suffrage meeting,\r\n    particularly in the mining camps, where to advertise that a woman is\r\n    going to speak is almost enough to cause them to close down the\r\n    mines in order that they might hear her. This summer Miss Martin,\r\n    the State president, and I went all over the State in a motor,\r\n    traveling about three thousand miles. We would travel sometimes one\r\n    hundred and twenty miles in order to reach a little settlement of\r\n    about one hundred people, sixty voters perhaps. We had the\r\n    conviction that if Suffrage was going to win in Nevada, it was going\r\n    to win through the votes of those people who lived in the remote\r\n    places. We knew Reno. We knew it well. We knew it was not to be\r\n    counted upon as giving any majority in favor of Suffrage. That was\r\n    the object of the motor trip this summer.\r\n\r\n    We traveled for miles and miles without seeing one sign of life.\r\n    There was only the sand, the sage-bush, and the sky. Even though we\r\n    did not arrive until ten o’clock at night at the place where we were\r\n    to speak, we always found our crowd waiting for us. There was one\r\n    mining camp, one of the richest camps there now, where the men said,\r\n    “We will give you ninety per cent, ladies, there is not a bit of\r\n    doubt about it.” When the returns came in from that camp, there were\r\n    eleven votes against it and one hundred and one for it. The\r\n    politicians laughed at us because we were so confident. “Don’t you\r\n    appreciate that many men who promised to vote for you just want to\r\n    make you feel good and haven’t any intention of doing it?” they\r\n    would say. When the returns came in I took a great deal of\r\n    satisfaction in showing them that the men had kept their promises.\r\n\r\n    The position that Nevada has geographically had a great deal to do\r\n    with it: We made a house-to-house canvass to find out if the\r\n    majority were in favor of Suffrage and we found that women out there\r\n    would say, “Of course I believe in Suffrage; I used to vote myself\r\n    in Idaho.” One woman told me, “I feel very much out of place here in\r\n    Nevada because I haven’t the right to vote. I voted for years in\r\n    Colorado.” It would have been an easy thing to prove that at least\r\n    seventy-five per cent of the women in Nevada were in favor of Woman\r\n    Suffrage. When the men said, “We are willing that Nevada women shall\r\n    have the vote when the majority of them want it,” we could say that\r\n    the majority of the women in the State of Nevada do want it.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   X\r\n\r\n                CONGRESS TAKES UP THE SUFFRAGE AMENDMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE effect of this campaign—the first of the kind in the history of the\r\nUnited States—was as though acid had been poured into the milk of the\r\nDemocratic calm and security. Within a few days of the appearance of the\r\nCongressional Union speakers, the Democratic papers were full of attacks\r\non the Congressional Union. The following from the _Wyoming Leader_ of\r\nOctober 6 is typical of the way the Democratic papers handled the\r\nCongressional Union workers:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Monday afternoon, they desecrated a charitable gathering of the\r\n    Ladies’ Hospital Aid.... If it was nothing more than the harmless\r\n    effort of a couple of women to earn some Congressional coin, it\r\n    might be overlooked, and these two women with fatherly tenderness,\r\n    told to go back home. But it involves an insult to the intelligent\r\n    citizenship of this State. It attempts to compromise and bring into\r\n    disrepute the practical workings of Woman Suffrage in this, the\r\n    original Suffrage State. It proposes to prostitute religion,\r\n    charity, fraternity, and society itself, to the ambition of a\r\n    place-and-plunder-hunting politician. These women go into gatherings\r\n    to insult and outrage harmony and good-will among women who\r\n    themselves avoid politics in their meetings.\r\n\r\n    They could not have selected a meeting at which it was so plainly\r\n    out of place as a meeting of hospital workers. These women had\r\n    gathered together to promote the good work of mercy and charity in\r\n    our community. They were Republicans, Progressives, and Democrats in\r\n    their preferences....\r\n\r\n    The editor of the _Leader_ has met and talked with these two women\r\n    and believes they do not realize the insult they are offering to the\r\n    women of Wyoming.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Republican papers of course instantly came to the rescue of the\r\nCongressional Union organizers. The _Cheyenne Tribune_ said editorially\r\non October 16:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Democratic newspapers like the _Wyoming Leader_ are finding fault\r\n    with the Woman Suffrage Congressional Union for sending\r\n    representatives into this State to work against the Democratic\r\n    candidate for Congress.\r\n\r\n    This is a free country, and Wyoming a Woman Suffrage State, and if\r\n    worthy, respectable women come into Wyoming, the first State to\r\n    grant the franchise to women, and conduct a decent campaign for the\r\n    principles of Woman Suffrage, they should be treated courteously and\r\n    given a respectful hearing.\r\n\r\n    They rightly hold the Democratic Party responsible for its\r\n    self-evident opposition to the cause of Woman Suffrage, and rightly\r\n    are seeking to defeat Democratic candidates for Congress by\r\n    endeavoring to get woman voters to vote against them.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs to the actual effects, I quote from the report of the Congressional\r\nUnion for Woman Suffrage for the year 1914:\r\n\r\n\r\n    One of the strongest proofs of the results accomplished in\r\n    Washington was given when Judge W. W. Black, Democratic candidate\r\n    for the United States Senate, called at the headquarters of the\r\n    Congressional Union in Seattle, and urged the organizers in charge,\r\n    in the words of the _Seattle Sunday Times_, “to go home and wage a\r\n    campaign for female Suffrage, and let the Democratic Congressional\r\n    candidates in this State alone. Judge Black disclaimed personal\r\n    interest,” continued the _Seattle Times_, “and insisted that his is\r\n    merely a fatherly concern for the two young Suffrage leaders. To\r\n    demonstrate that he was not concerned personally, Judge Black told\r\n    the two workers that he was going to be elected, anyway.”\r\n\r\n    Shortly before election day, Democratic leaders in Colorado formed a\r\n    Democratic woman’s organization for the purpose of actively\r\n    combating the Congressional Union’s work among the women voters.\r\n\r\n    Further striking evidence of the importance which the Democratic\r\n    leaders of Colorado attached to the Union’s activities was furnished\r\n    by a leaflet sent far and wide through the State, issued from the\r\n    Colorado Democratic State Headquarters, under the names of\r\n    Wellington H. Gates, Leo U. Guggenheim, and John T. Barnett,\r\n    National Democratic Committeemen. The leaflet began: “Permit us to\r\n    call your attention to the apparent aims and purposes of the\r\n    organization calling itself _The Congressional Union_.”\r\n\r\n    It then devoted four pages to letters and statements opposing the\r\n    policy of the Union, and ended with an appeal to the women voters to\r\n    elect the Democratic candidates for Congress “with larger majorities\r\n    than ever before, to show the world that the Democratic women of\r\n    Colorado are not only loyal, but consistent, voters.”\r\n\r\n    This was the last leaflet sent to the voters by the State Democratic\r\n    Committee. From the first word to the last, it dealt only with the\r\n    Congressional Union. Could better evidence be desired of the\r\n    important part which the Democrats themselves felt that Suffrage was\r\n    playing in the election?\r\n\r\n    Nowhere did the Congressional Union election work arouse greater\r\n    opposition than in Utah. “Intimidation, coercion, and what were\r\n    equivalent to threats of political banishment from the State of\r\n    Utah,” said the _Republican Herald_ of Salt Lake City (October 15),\r\n    “were exercised toward Miss Elsie Agnes Lancaster, the New York\r\n    Suffragist, by W. R. Wallace, the Democratic generalissimo, and his\r\n    gang of political mannikins.”\r\n\r\n    “They invited Miss Lancaster,” the _Herald_ continued, “to come to\r\n    Democratic State Headquarters, and there kept her on the grill for\r\n    two and a half hours. This term of cross-examination, during which\r\n    she was under fire of cross-questioning and denunciation from\r\n    practically all of the Democratic politicians present, was a vain\r\n    endeavor to have her bring to an immediate close her campaign\r\n    against the Democratic nominees for the United States Senate and\r\n    Congress. For two hours and a half, the hundred pounds of femininity\r\n    withstood the concentrated cross-fire of the ton of beef and brawn\r\n    represented by the dozen or more distinguished Democrats who acted\r\n    as attorney, judge, and jury all in one. After they had finished,\r\n    she went her way, telling Mr. Wallace that neither he nor his\r\n    hirelings could swerve her from her duty in Utah as a representative\r\n    of the Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage.\r\n\r\n    “The greatest outburst of Generalissimo Wallace,” concludes the\r\n    _Herald_, “was when, in a moment of rage, he brought his fist down\r\n    on the table and threatened to advertise Miss Lancaster the country\r\n    over by means of the Associated Press as being in league with\r\n    ‘sinister influences’ in Utah.”\r\n\r\n    One of the candidates for Congress from Kansas (Representative\r\n    Doolittle) called at the Washington Headquarters of the Union\r\n    shortly after the inauguration of work in Kansas, and urged the\r\n    Union to withdraw its campaigners from his district, at least, if\r\n    not over all the Western States. Finding the Union determined to\r\n    continue its opposition through the women voters, as long as his\r\n    Party continued its opposition to the National Amendment, Mr.\r\n    Doolittle delivered a speech in the House of Representatives\r\n    (occupying more than a page of the _Congressional Record_),\r\n    denouncing the Union, and assuring the members of Congress that its\r\n    appeal to the women voters was not authorized by the Suffragists of\r\n    the country.\r\n\r\n    Representative Hayden of Arizona also endeavored, in a speech in the\r\n    House, to answer the appeal of the Congressional Union to the\r\n    Western women to cast their votes against him, together with the\r\n    other national Democratic candidates. Nearly three pages of the\r\n    _Record_ was consumed by Mr. Hayden’s speech, which he reprinted,\r\n    and sent far and wide through the State of Arizona in an attempt to\r\n    counteract the havoc which it was apparently believed was being\r\n    wrought by the Congressional Union workers.\r\n\r\n    A prominent Democratic candidate for the Arizona Legislature\r\n    testified to the fear which the Union campaign had aroused among the\r\n    Democratic element in that State by an appeal to Dr. Cora Smith\r\n    King, a member of the Advisory Council of the Congressional Union,\r\n    urgently imploring her to use her influence with the Union to\r\n    terminate its election activities in Arizona. Dr. King replied: “The\r\n    more the local Democrats complain, the more they advertise the\r\n    slogan of the Congressional Union, that the Democrats put Suffrage\r\n    second to Party. Do, for Heaven’s sake, raise the Democratic roof in\r\n    Washington for involving you in this dilemma.”\r\n\r\n    Among the concrete results showing the effectiveness of the\r\n    Congressional Union election activities was the inclusion of a\r\n    Federal Suffrage Amendment plank in the platforms of each of the\r\n    State parties in Colorado, the first time that this occurred in that\r\n    State, and the inclusion of a similar plank in the Arizona\r\n    Democratic platform.\r\n\r\n    Another result was the conversion of Senator Smith of Arizona to a\r\n    belief in the Federal Amendment. On September 28, Senator Smith and\r\n    Representative Hayden, the two Democratic candidates who were\r\n    running for Congress from Arizona, sent the following telegram to\r\n    Mrs. Frances Munds, candidate for State Senatorship on the\r\n    Democratic ticket: “Our record in Congress shows that we are for\r\n    National Woman Suffrage. If you think best, offer as plank in State\r\n    platform the following: ‘We pledge our candidates for United States\r\n    Senator and Representative in Congress to vote at all times for\r\n    National Women Suffrage.’”\r\n\r\n    The Democratic Committee adopted and strengthened this platform.\r\n\r\n    All candidates, indeed, seemed to develop a marked increase in the\r\n    fervor of their allegiance to the Suffrage Amendment. Senator\r\n    Chamberlain of Oregon, in his last edition of street-car cards\r\n    before election day, headed his poster with a declaration of his\r\n    support of National Woman Suffrage as the leading argument for his\r\n    re-election.\r\n\r\n    Not only the Congressional candidates, but minor Democratic workers,\r\n    suddenly developed unsuspected interest in the cause of Woman\r\n    Suffrage. Said the _Examiner_ of Yuma, Arizona (October 24, 1914),\r\n    in commenting on the situation: “We view with amazement the efforts\r\n    of the Democratic bosses to be in favor of Equal Suffrage.”\r\n\r\n    And so in each of the States.\r\n\r\n    No more conclusive proof of the support given by the women voters to\r\n    the Union’s campaign could be afforded than the readiness with which\r\n    they became members and active workers.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    In undertaking the election campaign, the Union had expected that in\r\n    the beginning only the humble members of the rank and file would\r\n    respond to its appeal. It had fully realized that the rank and file\r\n    are more easily reached by new work than are the leaders. It was\r\n    with amazement, therefore, as well as gratification that it greeted\r\n    the co-operation of the leading women voters of the West. Their\r\n    willingness to subordinate Party interest to the National Suffrage\r\n    cause furnished the strongest assurance of the speedy organization\r\n    of the women’s vote to such a power as to make it a determining\r\n    factor in the outcome of things at Washington.\r\n\r\n    The rank and file, however, equalled the leaders in the enthusiasm\r\n    with which they supported the campaign. Women who had never before\r\n    been active in Suffrage work were aroused to an effective support of\r\n    the Congressional Union’s policy. Said the _Tribune_ of Pendleton,\r\n    Oregon (October 16), for instance, in commenting on this situation:\r\n\r\n    “Large numbers of women who had not even registered until the\r\n    campaign of the Congressional Union began, have made it their duty\r\n    to do so in order that they may cast their ballot on this one issue\r\n    alone. They had not been especially interested in the general\r\n    political campaign, but seeing the opportunity to assist in the\r\n    enfranchisement of other women, they have come bravely to the front\r\n    with offers of assistance.”\r\n\r\n    One of the illuminating features of the campaign was the aid given\r\n    to the Union in its election work by prominent Democratic women.\r\n    This support came from the Democratic women of the East as well as\r\n    of the West. For example, Mrs. George A. Armes, President of the\r\n    District of Columbia Branch of the National Wilson and Marshall\r\n    League, wrote to the Chairman of the Union during the election days:\r\n    “I have come to the conclusion that the greatest service I can\r\n    render to the National Democratic Party is to help to bring it to\r\n    realize that true democracy involves Suffrage for women as well as\r\n    for men. I know that it will come to a realization of the truth if\r\n    it sees that it can no longer count upon the women’s vote in the\r\n    West if it opposes the Suffrage Amendment. I am, therefore, heartily\r\n    with the election campaign of the Congressional Union in its appeal\r\n    to the women voters to cast their votes against all Democratic\r\n    candidates for Congress.”\r\n\r\n\r\nWomen voted in the election for forty-five members of Congress. The\r\nDemocratic Party ran candidates for forty-three members in these States.\r\nThe Congressional Union opposed all these candidates. Out of the\r\nforty-three Democratic candidates, only twenty were elected. In some of\r\nthese districts undoubtedly the women affected these results.\r\n\r\nI quote the same report:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Basing our estimate on the charges made by friends of the candidates\r\n    whom we were forced, by reason of the action of their Party, to\r\n    oppose, the Congressional Union campaign defeated Representative\r\n    Neely of Kansas, Mr. Flegel of Oregon, and Representative\r\n    Seldomridge of Colorado; and contributed in large measure to the\r\n    defeat of Mr. Hawley of Idaho, Mr. James H. Moyle of Utah, and Mr.\r\n    Roscoe Drumheller of Washington, and greatly lessened the majorities\r\n    of Senator Smith of Arizona, Senator Thomas, and Mr. Keating of\r\n    Colorado.\r\n\r\n    The campaign of the Congressional Union accomplished exactly what\r\n    its members hoped and expected that it would accomplish. If their\r\n    purpose had been merely to unseat Democrats, they would, of course,\r\n    have taken the districts in the United States where the Democrats\r\n    had won by very slight majorities. When they went into such strongly\r\n    Democratic States as Arizona and Colorado, they did not expect to\r\n    unseat any of the Democratic candidates in those States. Their\r\n    purpose was to make Woman Suffrage an ever-present political issue\r\n    in the States where women have political power until all the women\r\n    of the United States shall be enfranchised, and to lay in those\r\n    States the foundations for permanent and constantly-growing support\r\n    of the franchise work at Washington. They succeeded in making the\r\n    record of the Democratic Party on Woman Suffrage (an issue which\r\n    would not otherwise have been heard of) widely known and hotly\r\n    discussed in the Suffrage States.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Suffrage had come up again and again in Congress. On\r\nOctober 10, 1914, during discussion of the Philippine Bill, conferring a\r\ngreater measure of self-government on Filipino men, Representative Mann\r\nof Illinois proposed on that date that the franchise measure in the Bill\r\nbe so amended as to give the vote to women on the Islands. This\r\nAmendment was lost by a vote of fifty-eight to eighty-four. On October\r\n12, Representative J. W. Bryan of Washington, Progressive, proposed\r\nthree other Amendments: One, making women eligible to vote in school\r\nelections, which was lost by a vote of eleven to twenty-seven; one\r\ngiving the vote to women property-owners, which was lost by a vote of\r\nnine to twenty-seven, and one giving the Philippine legislature power to\r\nextend the right of Suffrage to women at any future time, which was lost\r\nby a vote of eleven to twenty-seven. The Amendments were defeated by\r\nstrictly Party votes, the Democrats voting almost solidly against them,\r\nwhile the Progressives and Republicans supported them.\r\n\r\nThis Session of Congress adjourned on October 4, 1914. At its close, the\r\nSuffrage Amendment was upon the calendar of the Senate and the House,\r\nready for a vote. In the House, however, the Rules Committee must\r\napportion time for the vote. Mr. Mondell’s Resolution providing for\r\nthis—and for which successive deputations had besieged the Rules\r\nCommittee—was still before the Rules Committee.\r\n\r\nThe short Session—the last Session of the Sixty-third Congress—opened on\r\nDecember 7. President Wilson’s message, read to Congress on December 8,\r\nmade no mention of the Woman Suffrage question, though it expressly\r\nrecommended the Bill granting further independence to the men of the\r\nPhilippines.\r\n\r\nIn December, therefore, Anne Martin, who had brought to brilliant\r\nvictory the campaign in Nevada, came to the Congressional Union’s\r\nHeadquarters in Washington. She called on the President to ask his\r\nassistance in furthering the passage of the Bristow-Mondell Amendment.\r\n\r\nIn referring to the victory in Nevada, the President said: “That is the\r\nway I believe it should come, by States.”\r\n\r\nMiss Martin then pointed out to the President the immense difficulties\r\ninvolved in State campaigns. She said: “The referendum campaigns are\r\nkilling work, and the women of America are working for the passage of\r\nthis Federal Amendment in order to end the long struggle.”\r\n\r\nMiss Martin referred to the President’s attitude toward the Filipinos.\r\nShe said she had read with interest that part of his message to Congress\r\nin which he advocated a larger measure of self-government for them. She\r\npointed out that Suffragists were asking for an extension of the same\r\nright to American women, and urged him to give equal support to the\r\nAmendment enfranchising his country-women.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Congressional Union began to send deputations to the refractory\r\nRules Committee, immediately upon the return of the Committee members to\r\nWashington. On December 9, Mrs. William Kent and Mrs. Gardner called\r\nupon Chairman Henry as soon as he reached the city. To their great\r\nastonishment, they were promptly assured by Mr. Henry that the Rules\r\nCommittee would report favorably House Resolution No. 514—providing time\r\nfor the consideration of the Suffrage Amendment in the House—which had\r\nbeen before it since May 13.\r\n\r\n\r\n    “Mr. Henry said,” says the _Suffragist_ of December 12, “that he had\r\n    always desired to make a favorable report of the Suffrage rule;\r\n    certain ‘sinister influences,’ however, working upon some of the\r\n    members of this Committee had made it impossible for the Committee\r\n    to take action upon it during the last Session. Mr. Henry did not\r\n    state what the ‘sinister influences’ were, nor why they had been\r\n    removed immediately after the election.”\r\n\r\n\r\nHe also assured representatives of the Union that the Rules Committee\r\nwould shortly bring the Amendment to a vote in the House.\r\n\r\n“There is every reason to believe,” said Mrs. Gilson Gardner commenting\r\non Mr. Henry’s glib change of front, “that the Party leaders have met\r\nand studied the Democratic returns from the campaign States.”\r\n\r\nOn January 12, the Resolution on the Susan B. Anthony Amendment was\r\ndebated for over six hours in the House and voted upon the same day. One\r\nhundred and seventy-four votes were cast for the Amendment, two hundred\r\nand four against it. Forty-six members were recorded as not voting. Of\r\nthe forty-six, twelve were paired in favor, and six paired against it.\r\nThe Amendment thus failed by seventy-eight votes of the necessary\r\ntwo-thirds.\r\n\r\nIt is a favorite trick with politicians to bring up the Amendment in the\r\nshort session of a dying Congress. They can vote no and still have a\r\nchance, in the new Congress, to redeem themselves before election.\r\n\r\nThe _Suffragist_ of January 23 quotes some of the reasons for opposing\r\nthe Amendment:\r\n\r\n\r\n    That Woman Suffrage cannot be supported because of a man’s respect,\r\n    admiration, and reverence for womanhood.\r\n\r\n    That five little colored girls marched in a Suffrage parade in\r\n    Columbus, Ohio.\r\n\r\n    That women must be protected against themselves. They think they\r\n    want to vote. As a matter of fact, they do not want to vote, and\r\n    man, being aware of this fact, is obliged to prevent them from\r\n    getting the ballot that they do not want.\r\n\r\n    That the ballot would degrade women.\r\n\r\n    That no man would care to marry a Suffragist.\r\n\r\n    That women do not read newspapers on street cars.\r\n\r\n    That women do not buy newspapers of Ikey Oppenstein, who keeps the\r\n    stand on the corner.\r\n\r\n    That no man would care to marry a female butcher.\r\n\r\n    That no man would care to marry a female policeman.\r\n\r\n    That Woman Suffrage is a matter for the States to determine.\r\n\r\n    That Mrs. Harriot Stanton Blatch once marched in a procession in\r\n    which she carried a banner inscribed, “One million Socialists vote\r\n    and work for Suffrage.”\r\n\r\n    That Inez Milholland married a Belgian and once referred to a\r\n    cabinet-officer as a joke.\r\n\r\n    That women fail to take part in the “duty of organized murder” and\r\n    might therefore vote against war.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                PART TWO\r\n                               1915-1916\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        THE WOMAN VOTERS APPEAL TO THE PRESIDENT AND TO CONGRESS\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE new—the Sixty-fourth—Congress did not meet until December in 1915.\r\nThis is the first and only summer in President Wilson’s administration\r\nin which Congress was not in session. Normally, Congress meets every\r\nother summer, but President Wilson has called three special sessions in\r\nthe alternate years. In consequence, that year in Washington is less\r\nfull than others with work with Congress or the President. In the\r\nmeantime, however, the Congressional Union did not permit the people of\r\nthe United States to forget the Suffrage fight.\r\n\r\nAlice Paul now felt that it was necessary to swing in the support of the\r\ncountry back of the Suffrage demand for the Federal Amendment. She felt\r\nthat this could only be accomplished by a nation-wide organization\r\nwhich, dissipating no energy in State work, would focus on Congress.\r\n\r\nAt a meeting of the Advisory Council in New York City on Wednesday,\r\nMarch 31, she outlined plans for the coming year. She said in part:\r\n\r\n\r\n    We want to organize in every State in the Union. We will begin this\r\n    by holding in each State a Convention on the same lines as this\r\n    Conference, at which we will explain our purposes, our plans, and\r\n    our ideals. At each of these Conferences, the members will select a\r\n    State Chairman, who will appoint a Chairman of each of the\r\n    Congressional constituencies in her State. Each Convention will also\r\n    adopt a plan of State organization, suited to the needs of their\r\n    locality. Each Convention too will send Representatives to a\r\n    culminating Convention of women voters, to be held at San Francisco\r\n    during the course of the Panama-Pacific Exposition, on September\r\n    14th, 15th, and 16th. At this first Convention of women voters to be\r\n    held on their own territory in behalf of the National Suffrage\r\n    Amendment, delegates will be appointed to go to Washington, D. C.,\r\n    the week Congress opens, to lay before their Representatives and the\r\n    leaders of the majority Party in Congress, the demand of women\r\n    voters for the national enfranchisement of women. During the opening\r\n    week in Congress, too, the pageant on the life of Susan B. Anthony,\r\n    along the lines which Hazel Mackaye has just outlined to you, will\r\n    be given. We want to make Woman Suffrage the dominant political\r\n    issue from the moment Congress reconvenes. We want to have Congress\r\n    open in the midst of a veritable Suffrage cyclone.\r\n\r\n    During the Sixty-third Congress, we have been able, with very little\r\n    organized support, to force action on the Federal Suffrage\r\n    Amendment. When we have an active body of members in every State in\r\n    the Union uniting in this demand, I believe that we will be able to\r\n    get our Amendment passed.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe organization of the various State Conventions progressed rapidly\r\nfrom week to week. An incredible amount of work was done—and done with\r\nthe swift, broad, slashing strokes which always characterized the\r\nCongressional Union work. This, of course, brought the Congressional\r\nUnion into prominence everywhere; but the eye of the country was held by\r\na new type of demonstration which, following her genius for picturesque\r\npublicity, Alice Paul immediately began to produce. The stage was the\r\nentire United States of America, and the leading woman in the—one would\r\nalmost call it a pageant—was Sara Bard Field of California. The prologue\r\nopened at the Panama-Pacific Exposition of 1915.\r\n\r\nThrough Mrs. Kent an exhibit booth for the Congressional Union for Woman\r\nSuffrage was secured in the Educational Building at the Panama-Pacific\r\nExposition. The Record of the Sixty-third Congress was exhibited there,\r\nand the people in charge invited detailed inspection from visitors. All\r\nAmerican visitors were asked to look up the record of their Congressman,\r\nto discover how he voted on the Suffrage Amendment: they were asked to\r\nsign the monster petition to Congress. This booth, always decorated with\r\npurple, white, and gold, was to become during the year the scene of\r\nmeeting after meeting; all characterized by the picturesqueness which\r\nwould inevitably emerge from a combination of the Congressional Union\r\nwith California.\r\n\r\nSara Bard Field, in the _Suffragist_ of September 11, thus describes it:\r\n\r\n\r\n    A world passes by. It looks reverently at the firmly-sweet face of\r\n    Susan B. Anthony, whose portrait hangs upon the wall. It scans the\r\n    record of the vote of the Sixty-third Congress.... It peers with\r\n    curious smiles at the brief array of lady dolls which mutely\r\n    proclaim the voting and non-voting States for women, and the forces\r\n    which prevent Suffrage....\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first California Conference of the Congressional Union was held in\r\nSan Francisco June 1 and 2. Every part of the State and every political\r\nParty was represented at the gathering. Florence Kelley, National\r\nSecretary of the Consumers’ League, appealed to the women of the West\r\nfor aid in the battle of Eastern women for Suffrage in the following\r\neloquent words:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I come from a State in which women have been trying to get Suffrage\r\n    for twenty-seven years. We are forced to come to you women of\r\n    California and ask you to stand behind us; and we are thankful that\r\n    California has re-enlisted for Suffrage. Women in California have\r\n    talked to me about the ease with which they won Suffrage, and praise\r\n    their men-folk. I would like to say there was nothing the matter\r\n    with my father. He was a Suffragist. There is nothing the matter\r\n    with our men in the State of New York. Our trouble is with the\r\n    steerage. They inundate our shores year after year. We slowly\r\n    assimilate and convert; but each year there is the same work to do\r\n    over—the same battle with ignorance and foreign ideas of freedom and\r\n    the “place of woman.”\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Kelley gave instance after instance of the humiliation to which\r\nwomen working on the New York Suffrage petition had been put by\r\nnaturalized foreign residents. She pointed out the curious, paradoxical\r\ninconsistency of granting foreigners the vote, and yet denying it to\r\nAmerican women.\r\n\r\nShe described with a real dramatic effect the incident of the\r\nPresident’s trip to Philadelphia, when he welcomed a great army of\r\nnaturalized immigrants, and denied a hearing to American women.\r\n\r\n\r\n    “There are some of our men,” she commented, “the mechanics of whose\r\n    minds we do not understand. George Washington, you may remember, in\r\n    Woodrow Wilson’s _History of the United States_, had no mother.”\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Kelley told of the battle women, themselves sworn to enforce the\r\nlaw, have to fight if they are without the ballot. She went into her\r\nexperiences as a voteless citizen of Illinois, when she was a factory\r\ninspector there.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Eastern women have been degraded by sixty-eight years of beggary.\r\n    They have begged of the steerage; they have begged of politicians;\r\n    now they find it possible to come West and ask the co-operation of\r\n    their own sisters. But I come to you with a nobler argument when I\r\n    ask you to support the work of the Congressional Union for Woman\r\n    Suffrage. Do not do it for us, even though we have borne the rigor\r\n    and heat of the day in the long fight for enfranchisement. Do it for\r\n    the children of the future: let them come into a noble heritage\r\n    through us.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe climax of this Conference came the final day when, at the Inside Inn\r\nball-room of the Exposition, the representatives of the eleven\r\nenfranchised States, the Territory of Alaska and in addition the\r\nenfranchised nations, meeting on the same platform, told what freedom\r\nfor women had accomplished in their nations and States. The great\r\nball-room was decorated with purple, white, and gold banners of the\r\nUnion, and massed with golden acacia. Many of the women representatives\r\nwore the costumes of their native land. Mayi Maki, a Finnish girl\r\ntypically blonde, in the striking peasant costume of Finland, spoke.\r\nMrs. Chem Chi, a Chinese woman, in the no less striking costume of\r\nChina, spoke. Representatives of New Zealand, the Isle of Man, Norway,\r\nIceland, and Denmark spoke.\r\n\r\nThe Congressional Union celebrated Bunker Hill Day, June 17, by another\r\ncharming occasion. It dedicated to the Massachusetts exhibit a miniature\r\nreproduction of Bunker Hill monument, thrown into relief by a\r\nblack-velvet background, which bore the history of the notable women of\r\nthe State.\r\n\r\nIt was a brilliant day, sunny and clear. The Massachusetts Building, a\r\nfacsimile of the noble State House of Boston, situated between the\r\ngorgeous bay of San Francisco and the iridescent Marin shore on the one\r\nhand, and the long line of orientally colored Exposition Buildings on\r\nthe other, was decorated for the occasion with the red, white, and blue\r\nof the national flag, and the white of the great State flag.\r\n\r\nA procession of Suffragists, headed by Gail Laughlin, wearing the\r\npurple, white, and gold regalia, and escorted by a special military\r\nband, marched behind a large purple, white, and gold flag, and between\r\nan avenue of purple, white, and gold flags up to the Massachusetts\r\nBuilding, where they were confronted by a great banner, bearing the\r\nwords of the Susan B. Anthony Amendment.\r\n\r\nGail Laughlin, who was educated in Massachusetts, said in part:\r\n\r\n\r\n    There were Pilgrim mothers in those days, as well as Pilgrim\r\n    Fathers, though they were singularly absent from history. You will\r\n    find nothing of them in the schoolbooks; you have to go to the\r\n    sources from which histories are made. Then Mary Warren, advisor of\r\n    Knox and Adams and Jefferson; and Hannah Winthrop and Abigail Adams\r\n    begin to stand out beside the men who are said to have made the\r\n    history of that time. Was it not Abigail Adams who wrote to her\r\n    husband at the Continental Congress when the very document we women\r\n    are now striving to change was drawn up: “If you do not free the\r\n    women of the nation, there will be another revolution.” I consider\r\n    Abigail Adams the first member of the Congressional Union for Woman\r\n    Suffrage.\r\n\r\n    There was Julia Ward Howe, the author of _The Battle Hymn of the\r\n    Republic_, and Harriet Beecher Stowe, who so largely helped in the\r\n    freeing of the slaves; and Lucy Stone, that staunch Abolitionist and\r\n    Suffragist—all closely linked with Massachusetts’ great history. It\r\n    was Lucy Stone who, when protest was made that she injected “too\r\n    much suffrage” into her Abolitionist speeches, declared, “I was a\r\n    woman before I was an Abolitionist.”\r\n\r\n\r\nLater, at a mass-meeting of the Congressional Union, Maud Younger, who,\r\nin Washington, was to become so steadfast a worker for the Congressional\r\nUnion, spoke. Maud Younger is one of the most picturesque of the many\r\npicturesque figures among the native daughters of California: a student\r\nof economic conditions; a feminist; much traveled; an ex-president of\r\nthe Waitresses’ Union; her life is as inextricably mixed with the Labor\r\nand Suffrage history of California as later it was bound with the\r\nWoman’s Party. On this occasion, she said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The burden of the women of the unenfranchised States, their\r\n    struggles, is ours more than it ever was; our freedom is not our own\r\n    while they are unenfranchised. I realized in the East that we women\r\n    can spend a lifetime for Suffrage, if we continue to work State by\r\n    State only. Do you realize that, since we won our vote in\r\n    California, Ohio has been twice defeated, and Michigan twice\r\n    defeated?... I heard Frank P. Walsh, Chairman of the Industrial\r\n    Railways Commission, say in Washington: “The ballot for women will\r\n    only come through the persistent and unremitting effort of the women\r\n    in the free States.”\r\n\r\n\r\nMaud Younger was followed by Andrew Gallagher, equally important, and\r\nequally as picturesque a figure among the Native Sons of California. Mr.\r\nGallagher is an ex-champion amateur heavyweight of the Pacific Coast; a\r\nlabor leader; a power in California politics. He said in part:\r\n\r\n\r\n    In those days when Suffrage hopes were dark in California, Labor\r\n    stood by women; as we stood for State Suffrage, so now we stand for\r\n    National Suffrage. If Labor can help to bring about the passage of\r\n    the National Woman Suffrage Amendment, then Labor will put its\r\n    shoulder to the wheel, and do all in its power to force its\r\n    adoption.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Political Convention of Woman Voters held in San Francisco in\r\nSeptember at the Panama-Pacific Exposition, carried out all these\r\ntraditions of picturesqueness. Mrs. O. H. P. Belmont opened the\r\nConvention. Mrs. Fremont Older, the novelist, spoke. Dr. Yami Kin, the\r\nfirst woman physician in China—bringing to the event a picturesque touch\r\nof internationalism by wearing a pale blue brocaded mandarin coat—spoke\r\nin excellent English. Mme. Ali Kuli Khan, the wife of the Persian\r\nMinister, and Mme. Maria Montessori, the famous Italian physician and\r\neducator, also spoke.\r\n\r\nMrs. Belmont said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    We women of the North, of the South and of the East, branded on\r\n    account of sex, disfranchised as criminals and imbeciles, come to\r\n    the glorious West, where the broad vision of its men has seen\r\n    justice.\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Older said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I thought that Woman Suffrage was like Utopia; when women were good\r\n    enough to vote, the men would give it to them; but I have learned\r\n    that Utopias are not given away; they must be fought for.\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Yami Kin said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    All countries look to North and West for inspiration and help in\r\n    their march toward freedom.\r\n\r\n\r\nMme. Montessori said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    We have watched individual States in your country give justice to\r\n    women, one by one. Now we are waiting for the United States to\r\n    declare its women free.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Convention passed Resolutions calling upon the Sixty-fourth Congress\r\nto vote for the Susan B. Anthony Amendment. Sara Bard Field and Frances\r\nJoliffe were selected as envoys to carry the Resolution across the\r\ncountry to Congress. A plan was made for the envoys to travel slowly\r\neastward, holding meetings and collecting signatures to the petition;\r\narriving in Washington the day Congress assembled. Mabel Vernon acted as\r\nadvance guard for this expedition and was more responsible than anybody\r\nelse for its success.\r\n\r\nThe final ceremony of the Convention took place in the Court of\r\nAbundance on the night of the day which had been designated by the\r\ndirectors of the Exposition as the Congressional Union for Woman\r\nSuffrage Day. On that evening, Mr. M. H. DeYoung, on behalf of the\r\ndirectors of the Exposition, presented Mrs. Belmont for the\r\nCongressional Union with a bronze medal in recognition of the work of\r\nthe Congressional Union. Ten thousand people gathered there to witness\r\nit. They listened rapt to the speeches, and then—lighting their way by\r\nthousands of golden lanterns—accompanied the envoys to the gates.\r\n\r\nThe national Suffrage Edition of the _San Francisco Bulletin_, edited by\r\nMrs. O. H. P. Belmont, assisted by Doris Stevens as city editor, Mrs.\r\nJohn Jay White as art editor and Alice Paul as telegraph editor,\r\ncharmingly described the scene:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The great place was softly and naturally lit except for the giant\r\n    tower gate flaming aloft in the white light, which focussed on it as\r\n    on some brilliant altar. Far below, like a brilliant flower bed,\r\n    filling the terraced side from end to end, glowed the huge chorus of\r\n    women, which was one of the features of the evening. Those at the\r\n    top—hardly women—were the girls of the Oriental School, from midget\r\n    size up, in quaintly colorful native costumes. In the foreground\r\n    were the Finnish, Swedish, and Norwegian girls in their peasant\r\n    costumes, and, stretching the length of the stage, like a great\r\n    living flag of the Congressional Union, were massed Union members in\r\n    surplices of the organization colors. The effect was one of exotic\r\n    brilliancy.\r\n\r\n    Back of the stage, curtaining the great arch, fluttered the red,\r\n    white, and blue emblem of the nation that women have sacrificed as\r\n    much to upbuild as the men; but significantly waving with the Stars\r\n    and Stripes hung the great Suffrage banner, that ringingly declared:\r\n    WE DEMAND AN AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES\r\n    ENFRANCHISING WOMEN. And the great crowd in the Court joined in the\r\n    swelling song that another band of women across the sea, fighting\r\n    for liberty, had originated. Every one was catching the words:\r\n\r\n                “Shout, shout, up with your song!\r\n                Cry with the wind, for the dawn is breaking.\r\n                March, march, swing you along,\r\n                Wide blow our banners, and hope is waking.”\r\n\r\n    And then came the envoys, delegated by women voters to carry the\r\n    torch of liberty through the dark lands and keep it burning. And the\r\n    dark mass below the lighted altar-tower caught the choristers’\r\n    spirit, and burst into cheers.\r\n\r\n    The chorus also sang the _Song of the Free Women_, written by Sara\r\n    Bard Field to the music of the _Marseillaise_.\r\n\r\n    The envoys spoke. Their words were greeted with cheers. One of the\r\n    nation’s greatest actresses, Margaret Anglin, said a few fitting\r\n    farewell words to them in the name of the women of the world.\r\n\r\n    Then, all at once, the great, brightly-colored picture and its dark\r\n    background began to disintegrate and fade. The Court darkened, but\r\n    bright masses of women were forming in procession to escort the\r\n    envoys to the gates of the Exposition. Orange lanterns swayed in the\r\n    breeze; purple, white, and gold draperies fluttered, the blare of\r\n    the band burst forth, and the great surging crowd followed to the\r\n    gates.\r\n\r\n    There, Ingeborg Kindstedt and Maria Kindberg, of Providence, Rhode\r\n    Island, who had purchased the car that is to take the crusaders on\r\n    their long journey, met the procession. The Overland car was covered\r\n    with Suffrage streamers. Miss Kindberg was at the wheel. To the wild\r\n    cheering of the crowd, Miss Joliffe and Mrs. Field, the two envoys\r\n    for Washington, were seated. The crowd surged close with final\r\n    messages. Cheers burst forth as the gates opened, and the big car\r\n    swung through, ending the most dramatic and significant Suffrage\r\n    Convention that has probably ever been held in the history of the\r\n    world.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd so Alice Paul’s stupendous pageant—whose stage was the entire United\r\nStates—opened.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe petition which the envoys were to carry across the country to\r\nWashington was, even when it left California, the largest ever signed in\r\none place. It was 18,333 feet long, and contained 500,000 names.\r\n\r\nVery soon after the envoys started, President Wilson made his first\r\ndeclaration for Suffrage. He also went to New Jersey and voted for it.\r\n\r\nFrances Joliffe was called back to California by illness in her family\r\nat the beginning of the journey. Sara Bard Field, therefore, continued\r\nalone across the continent with her two Swedish convoys. It was a\r\nremarkable trip, filled with unexpected adventure. A long procession of\r\nMayors and Governors welcomed Mrs. Field in her nation-wide journey.\r\nEverywhere she advertised the Democratic record in Congress. One of the\r\nearly mishaps was to get lost in the desert of Utah. They wandered about\r\nfor a whole day, and regained the highway in time to arrive in Salt Lake\r\nCity at five o’clock in the afternoon. Later in Kansas came a more\r\nserious mishap. But let Mrs. Field speak for herself. No better picture\r\ncan be given of her picturesque journey than her own reports, published\r\nfrom time to time in the _Suffragist_.\r\n\r\nFrom Fallon, Nevada, Mrs. Field wrote:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Here we are in the heart of Nevada’s desert, having traveled already\r\n    over three hundred and eighty miles of every kind of country—meadow\r\n    land, green, luxurious ranches, rolling hill country, steep mountain\r\n    grades, the grass lands of the Sierras, and now through the bare but\r\n    beautiful desert.\r\n\r\n    We reached Reno at midnight on Sunday after a vision of the sublime\r\n    chaos of the Sierras at night.\r\n\r\n    At night, from a car flying the Congressional Union colors and the\r\n    Amendment banner, Miss Martin and I spoke in the streets of Reno.\r\n    The crowd listened with close attention, and pressed closely about\r\n    the car to sign the petition.\r\n\r\n    At noon today, we left Reno for the most trying and perilous part of\r\n    our journey. We are traveling across some six hundred miles of\r\n    barren land known as the “Great American Desert.” Our next\r\n    destination is Salt Lake City.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Salt Lake City, Mrs. Field wrote:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The State Capitol, where each meeting was held, stands on a hill.\r\n    The world is at its feet. The mountains wall the entire city....\r\n    While the earth was glowing in the light of a flaming sunset, and\r\n    the mountains about stood like everlasting witnesses, Representative\r\n    Howell of Utah pledged his full and unqualified support to the Susan\r\n    B. Anthony Amendment in the coming session of Congress.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Colorado Springs, their reception was almost a pageant. Marching to\r\nmusic, a procession of women clad in purple, white, and gold surplices\r\nand carrying banners, accompanied the Suffrage car to the City Hall\r\nwhere they sang _The March of the Women_ and _The Song of the Free\r\nWomen_. The Mayor of Colorado Springs greeted them with a welcoming\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\nIn the bogs of southern Kansas, the Suffrage car had an adventure. The\r\n_Suffragist_ says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Pulling into Hutchinson on Monday evening over muddy roads, the car\r\n    plunged suddenly into a deep hole filled with water. The body of the\r\n    _Flier_ was almost submerged. The petitioners, fearing to step out\r\n    of the car, sat and called “Help!” into the darkness of the night\r\n    until their voices were hoarse. No response came from the apparently\r\n    deserted country. But they knew there was a farmhouse about a mile\r\n    back. So Sara Bard Field, little but brave, slipped away from her\r\n    place on the back seat; before her companions knew it, was almost up\r\n    to her waist in slimy mud. Hardly able to pull one foot out of the\r\n    mud to plant it ahead of the other, she finally, after a two hours’\r\n    struggle, reached the ranch, where the farmer and his son were\r\n    roused from their sleep (for it was now midnight) and told of the\r\n    women’s plight. In a little while, horses were harnessed and a\r\n    rescue party was on its way; but not until three o’clock did the\r\n    women start toward Hutchinson tired and wet, and covered with mud.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Kansas City, Missouri, the Suffragists, accompanied by a procession\r\nof automobiles, impressively long, called first on Mayor Jost and then\r\non Senator Reed. The difference between Suffrage and non-Suffrage States\r\nbecame immediately evident from Mayor Jost’s attitude; for, while he\r\nbade the envoys welcome, he declined to state his own convictions on the\r\npurposes of their journey. There was no doubt about Senator Reed’s\r\nconviction. He had voted against the Suffrage measure in the last\r\nSession. The women made speeches. In answer, Senator Reed spoke several\r\nsentences in such a low and indistinct manner that no one in the crowd\r\nthat overflowed his office could understand him, and a man in the\r\ndelegation called out, “You need say only one word, Senator.” There were\r\nmore speeches from the women, and, when Senator Reed saw that something\r\nmust be said, he finally declared he “would take the matter into\r\nconsideration.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Field writing of Missouri, said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “In the enemy’s country,”—that is what the newspapers said of our\r\n    arrival in Missouri, the first non-Suffrage State we reached. Such\r\n    kind, genial, hospitable “enemies.” I wish all enemies were of their\r\n    disposition. For a whole day and night, Kansas City, Missouri, was\r\n    alive with Suffrage enthusiasm; great crowds attended our advent\r\n    everywhere. We never spoke that whole day, from our noon meeting on\r\n    the City Hall steps until the last late street meeting at night, but\r\n    we had more people to talk to than our voices could reach. As our\r\n    auto procession passed down the street, crowds gathered to see it;\r\n    and the windows of every business house and office building were\r\n    lined with kindly faces. Often, there was applause and cheers; when\r\n    these were lacking, there was a peculiar sort of earnest curiosity.\r\n    And, oh the Suffragists! I wish that every western voting woman who\r\n    is making a sacrificial effort at all for National Suffrage could\r\n    have seen those grateful women. “The greatest day for Suffrage\r\n    Kansas has ever seen,” said some of the older Suffrage workers: “How\r\n    good of the western women to come to our aid!” At the City Club\r\n    meeting, which was packed, Mr. Frank P. Walsh predicted National\r\n    Suffrage in 1916. There was good fellowship over a Suffrage dinner,\r\n    and earnest street meetings afterwards; gravely interested crowds\r\n    attended, and the newspapers gave large space. The whole city talked\r\n    National Suffrage for at least two days.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Topeka occurred another adventure. A great crowd awaited the Suffrage\r\nautomobile for two hours. But sixty miles away, afflicted with tire\r\ntrouble and engine difficulties, the car stood stationary for those two\r\nhours. And all the time, the valiant Mabel Vernon talked, hoping against\r\nhope that the arrival of the car would interrupt her speech. She says\r\nthat in those two hours she talked everything she ever knew, guessed,\r\nhoped, or wished for Suffrage.\r\n\r\nThe Chicago reception was unusually picturesque. Enthusiasm was\r\nheightened by the fact that the women voters were holding a Convention\r\nthere, and they added their welcome to that of the city.\r\n\r\nAt eleven o’clock in the morning, fifty automobiles, flying the Suffrage\r\ncolors, and filled with Suffrage workers from all organizations, met\r\nMrs. Field at her hotel. Then the long line of cars escorted by mounted\r\nofficers, passed through the crowded streets to the Art Museum on the\r\nwide Michigan Boulevard. Here was a stage equal in impressiveness,\r\nalthough of quite a different kind, to that of the Court of Abundance,\r\nwhich saw the envoys depart down their nation-wide trail. Back of them\r\nwas the great silver-gray Lake; in front of them, the long line of\r\nmonolithic Chicago skyscrapers, grim and weather-blackened; and on both\r\nsides the wide expanses of the Boulevard. The Suffrage women, a mass of\r\nbrilliant color, covered the steps of the Museum. At the top a chorus of\r\na hundred women grouped about the band. From the bronze standard in the\r\ncenter of the steps hung the Amendment banner. And in their midst, like,\r\nas somebody has said—“a brown autumn leaf blown from the West”—Sara Bard\r\nField in her simple traveling suit punctuated all that vividness.\r\n\r\nMayor Thompson said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Speaking for the City of Chicago, which I have the honor to\r\n    represent, I can say that we wish you God-speed and much success in\r\n    your mission.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe further told Mrs. Field:\r\n\r\n\r\n    We have watched the growth of the Suffrage movement with great\r\n    interest, and as you know, we have partial Suffrage in Illinois. I\r\n    hope it will not be long before women have full Suffrage here and\r\n    throughout the nation.\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Field replied:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I like Mayor Thompson’s way of putting it. At Kansas City the other\r\n    day, the Mayor quite flustered me with his speech. He said so many\r\n    things about women—for instance, that woman was a Muse that soared;\r\n    that she was the poetry of our existence; and something about the\r\n    sun, moon, and stars. Then he added that he did not think women\r\n    should be allowed to vote. I think Mayor Thompson’s method is much\r\n    better.\r\n\r\n    “My recollections yesterday,” Mrs. Field wrote to the _Suffragist_,\r\n    “are a confused mass of impressions—music and cheers—throngs of men,\r\n    women, and children—colors flying in the sunshine, and great crowds\r\n    surging and pressing about.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Indianapolis, there gathered to meet the envoys the largest street\r\nmeeting ever held in Indiana in behalf of Suffrage. The _Indianapolis\r\nNews_ of November 8 says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Mrs. Sara Bard Field, brown-eyed and slender, saw men gather at the\r\n    curbing in the shadows of the Morton Monument, on the State House\r\n    steps, shortly after noon today—watched them smile as she began her\r\n    talk for Woman Suffrage, then saw their faces grow serious as they\r\n    stepped nearer. Then she smiled herself, and her argument poured\r\n    forth while “old hands” in the State House coterie and machine\r\n    politicians stood with open mouths and drank in her pleadings.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is only space for glimpses of this picturesque single pilgrimage\r\nfrom now on to its reception at Washington. At Detroit, they were\r\nwelcomed by a glowing evening reception. A long procession of\r\nautomobiles, decorated with yellow flags, yellow pennants, yellow\r\nballoons, and illuminated yellow lanterns, met them on the outskirts of\r\nthe city, and escorted them to the steps of the County Building. Here\r\nfour stone urns foamed with red fire. “The scene was,” one of the papers\r\nsaid, “like pictures of Rome in the time of the Cæsars....” In\r\nCleveland, they held an open-air meeting in the public square in the\r\nmidst of a whirling snowstorm. A drum, a trombone, and a cornet escorted\r\nthem—with an effect markedly comic—through the echoing corridors of the\r\nCity Hall to the Mayor’s office; escorted them, after the official call,\r\nonto the street again. In New York came their first real accident. On\r\nthe way to Geneva, the axle broke. The Rochester motor companies\r\ndeclared it was impossible to do anything for a day at least; but Mrs.\r\nField telephoned to the head office at Toledo, and a new axle appeared\r\nin Rochester at seven o’clock in the evening. However, the envoys had to\r\ndrive through cold and a light fall of snow until half-past one in the\r\nmorning, in order to make the meeting at Syracuse the next day.... In\r\nAlbany, preceded by a musical car which played _The Battle Hymn of the\r\nRepublic_, they proceeded to the enormous Capitol Building, where\r\nGovernor Whitman, surrounded by his staff, met them. The Governor was\r\namazed that a woman had driven the car all the way from San Francisco,\r\nand even more amazed at the size of the envoy. “I thought you would be\r\nsix feet tall,” he said.... At Providence, after a rousing welcome in\r\nBoston—where Governor Walsh met the envoys, and the enormous crowd which\r\naccompanied them, in the beautiful rotunda of the State House—the little\r\ncar, which now registered nearly five thousand miles of hard travel, was\r\nput on the boat, and its occupants brought to New York City. The\r\nweather-beaten automobile, bearing the slogan on the front, ON TO\r\nCONGRESS!, and on the back, the great Demand banner, WE DEMAND AN\r\nAMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES ENFRANCHISING WOMEN,\r\nfollowed one hundred other cars, beautifully decorated with purple\r\nribbons, with gold and white chrysanthemums and with floating golden\r\nballoons, blazed—among the jet-black motors and the glossy green busses\r\nof Fifth Avenue—a path of purple and gold. A huge meeting was held in\r\nthe ball-room at Sherry’s at which Mrs. O. H. P. Belmont, Frances\r\nJoliffe, and Florence Kelley spoke for the Suffragists. Sara Bard Field\r\nclosed the meeting. The _Tribune_ said: “A tired little woman in a\r\ntravel-worn brown suit, she stood in the glitter of Sherry’s ball-room,\r\nand held out a tired little brown hand.”\r\n\r\n“We want to help you, the voting women of the West,” she pleaded; “will\r\nyou let us?” “The audience,” the _Suffragist_ says, “was moved to tears\r\nand action: six thousand dollars was contributed to the Congressional\r\nUnion.”\r\n\r\nThe late Mayor Mitchell telephoned to the meeting his regret that he was\r\nunable to be present because of illness; but he received the envoys at\r\nhis home, and added his name to the petition.\r\n\r\nAt Washington, the envoys were met by an escort, planned and directed\r\nfor the Congressional Union by Mary Austin, the celebrated novelist. It\r\ncomprised a group of mounted women, representing the eleven States and\r\nAlaska, in all of which women are enfranchised; another group,\r\nrepresenting the thirty-seven unenfranchised States; great numbers of\r\nflag and banner bearers, wearing long, purple capes with deep yellow\r\ncollars and white stoles; hundreds of women carrying purple, white, and\r\ngold pennants.\r\n\r\nThe party started at once for the Capitol to the music first of the\r\n_Marseillaise_ and then of _Dixie_.\r\n\r\nThere were two picturesque features of the parade. The famous petition\r\nitself, bearing five hundred thousand signatures, unrolled to the length\r\nof one hundred feet, and carried by twenty bearers, was the focus for\r\nall eyes. A replica of the Liberty Bell, lavishly decorated in purple,\r\nwhite, and gold, and mounted on the same truck which had carried it\r\nthrough the Pennsylvania State campaign, of course attracted almost an\r\nequal degree of attention.\r\n\r\nAt the top of the high broad Capitol steps Senator Sutherland of Utah\r\nand Representative Mondell, surrounded by a group of Senators and\r\nRepresentatives, formed a reception committee. To music, Sara Bard Field\r\nand Frances Joliffe marched up the steps followed by the petition\r\nbearers and attendants. The envoys made speeches and Senator Sutherland\r\nand Representative Mondell replied to them.\r\n\r\nFrom the Capitol, the party proceeded to the White House.\r\n\r\nPresident Wilson received the envoys in the East Room. Anne Martin\r\nintroduced Sara Bard Field and Frances Joliffe.\r\n\r\nIn closing, Miss Joliffe said: “Help us, Mr. President, to a new freedom\r\nand a larger liberty.”\r\n\r\nSara Bard Field emphasized that same note:\r\n\r\n\r\n    ... and, Mr. President, as I am not to have the woman’s privilege of\r\n    the last word, may I say that I know what your plan has been in the\r\n    past, that you have said it was a matter for the States. But we have\r\n    seen that, like all great men, you have changed your mind on other\r\n    questions. We have watched the change and development of your mind\r\n    on preparedness, and we honestly believe that circumstances have so\r\n    altered that you may change your mind in this regard.\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Field then requested the President to look at the petition. He\r\nadvanced, unrolled a portion of it, and examined it with interest.\r\n\r\nThe President said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I did not come here anticipating the necessity of making an address\r\n    of any kind. As you have just heard (and here the President smiled),\r\n    I hope it is true that I am not a man set stiffly beyond the\r\n    possibility of learning. I hope that I shall continue to be a\r\n    learner as long as I live.\r\n\r\n    I can only say to you this afternoon that nothing could be more\r\n    impressive than the presentation of such a request in such numbers\r\n    and backed by such influence as undoubtedly stands behind you.\r\n    Unhappily it is too late for me to consider what is to go into my\r\n    message, because that went out to the newspapers at least a week\r\n    ago; and I have a habit—perhaps the habit of the teacher—of\r\n    confining my utterances to one subject at a time, for fear that two\r\n    subjects might compete with one another for prominence. I have felt\r\n    obliged in the present posture of affairs to devote my message to\r\n    one subject, and am, therefore, sorry to say that it is too late to\r\n    take under consideration your request that I embody this in my\r\n    message. All I can say with regard to what you are urging at present\r\n    is this: I hope I shall always have an open mind, and I shall\r\n    certainly take the greatest pleasure in conferring in the most\r\n    serious way with my colleagues at the other end of the city with\r\n    regard to what is the right thing to do at this time concerning this\r\n    great matter. I am always restrained, as some of you will remember,\r\n    by the consciousness that I must speak for others as well as for\r\n    myself as long as I occupy my present office, and, therefore, I do\r\n    not like to speak for others until I consult others and see what I\r\n    am justified in saying.\r\n\r\n    This visit of yours will remain in my mind, not only as a very\r\n    delightful compliment, but also as a very impressive thing which\r\n    undoubtedly will make it necessary for all of us to consider very\r\n    carefully what is right for us to do.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that in this speech, the President referred to the\r\n“influence” behind the women. He speaks of the “impressive” quality of\r\nthis demonstration.\r\n\r\nFrom now on the strength of the woman voters became a dominant note in\r\nthe work with both the President and Congress.\r\n\r\nOn December 12, a great mass-meeting of welcome to the envoys was held\r\nin the Belasco Theatre. Forty-five thousand dollars was pledged there\r\nfor the work with Congress.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Sixty-fourth Congress convened December 6.\r\n\r\nThe Susan B. Anthony Amendment, at the request of the Congressional\r\nUnion, was introduced in the Senate on December 7 by Senator Sutherland\r\nof Utah and in the House on December 6 by Representative Mondell of\r\nWyoming. Other members introduced the identical measure the same day. In\r\nthe Senate, it was referred to the Committee on Woman Suffrage and in\r\nthe House to the Judiciary Committee.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn December 16 occurred a Suffrage hearing before the Judiciary\r\nCommittee. It will be remembered that this was the first hearing since\r\nthe Congressional Union had campaigned against the Democratic Party. It\r\nwas one of the most stormy in the history of the Congressional Union.\r\nLater a Republican Congressman referred to it, not as the “hearing,” but\r\nas the “interruption.” The storm did not break until after two hours in\r\nwhich the speakers of the other Suffrage Association had been heard, and\r\nthe following members of the Congressional Union: Mrs. Andreas Ueland,\r\nJennie C. Law Hardy, Florence Bayard Hilles, Mabel Vernon, all\r\nintroduced by Alice Paul.\r\n\r\nAt this point, there occurred among the Democratic members of the\r\nCommittee a sudden meeting of heads, a disturbed whispering. To informed\r\nlookers-on, it became evident that it had just dawned on them that the\r\npale, delicate, slender slip of a girl in a gown of violet silk and a\r\nlong Quakerish white fichu was the power behind all this agitation, that\r\nredoubtable Alice Paul who had waged the campaign of 1914 against them.\r\n\r\nAs Alice Paul rose to introduce one of the speakers, Mr. Taggart of\r\nKansas interrogated her. It will be remembered that this was the Mr.\r\nTaggart whose majority had been diminished, by the Woman’s Party\r\ncampaign, from three thousand to three hundred.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Mr. Taggart to Miss Paul: Are you here to report progress in your\r\n    effort to defeat Democratic candidates?\r\n\r\n    Miss Paul: We are here to talk about this present Congress—this\r\n    present situation. We are here to ask the Judiciary Committee to\r\n    report this bill to the House.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Taggart: I take this occasion to say as a member of this\r\n    committee that if there was any partisan organization made up of men\r\n    who had attempted to defeat members of this committee, I do not\r\n    think we would have given them a hearing. And if they had been men,\r\n    they wouldn’t have asked it.\r\n\r\n    Miss Paul: But you hear members of the Republican Party and of the\r\n    Prohibition Party.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Webb: They aren’t partisan. (Laughter).\r\n\r\n    Mr. Taggart, coming back to the attack: You didn’t defeat a single\r\n    Democratic Member of Congress in a Suffrage State.\r\n\r\n    Miss Paul, quickly: Why, then, are you so stirred up over our\r\n    campaign? (Audible murmur from Republican left wing).\r\n\r\n    Mr. Webb: I move a recess of this committee for one hour.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the recess Miss Paul rose to introduce Helen Todd of California.\r\n\r\nMr. Williams put the following question to her:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Miss Paul, would you state to me the names of the candidates for\r\n    Congress which your organization opposed in the State of Illinois?\r\n\r\n    Miss Paul: We conducted our campaign only in the nine States in\r\n    which women were able to vote for members of Congress. In no way did\r\n    we participate in the campaign in Illinois.\r\n\r\n\r\nMiss Paul then introduced Helen Todd. After Miss Todd had spoken,\r\nFrances Joliffe and Sara Bard Field spoke.\r\n\r\nLater Alice Paul said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    In closing the argument before this committee, may I summarize our\r\n    position? We have come here to ask one simple thing: that the\r\n    Judiciary Committee refer this Suffrage Amendment, known as the\r\n    Susan B. Anthony Amendment, to the House of Representatives. We are\r\n    simply asking you to do what you can do—that you let the House of\r\n    Representatives decide this question. We have tried to bring people\r\n    to this hearing from all over the United States to show the desire\r\n    of women that this should be done.\r\n\r\n    I want to emphasize just one point, in addition, that we are\r\n    absolutely non-partisan. We are made up of women who are strong\r\n    Democrats, women who are strong Republicans, women who are\r\n    Socialists, Progressives—every type of women. We are all united on\r\n    this one thing—that we put Suffrage before everything else. In every\r\n    election, if we ever go into any future elections, we simply pledge\r\n    ourselves to this—that we will consider the furtherance of Suffrage\r\n    and not our party affiliations in deciding what action we shall\r\n    take.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Williams, of Illinois: Is it your policy to fight this question\r\n    out only as a national issue? Do you make any attempt to secure\r\n    relief through the States?\r\n\r\n    Miss Paul: The Congressional Union is organized to work for an\r\n    Amendment to the National Constitution. We feel that the time has\r\n    come, because of the winning of so many Suffrage States in the West,\r\n    to use the votes of women to get Suffrage nationally. In the earlier\r\n    days in this country, all the Suffrage work was done in the States,\r\n    but the winning of the Western States has given us a power which we\r\n    did not have before, so we have now turned from State work to\r\n    national work. We are concentrating on the national government.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Gard: Miss Paul, is it true that you prefer to approach this\r\n    through the State legislatures than to approach it directly through\r\n    the people?\r\n\r\n    Miss Paul: We prefer the quickest way, which we believe is by\r\n    Congressional action.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Taggart: Why did you oppose the Democrats in the last election?\r\n\r\n    Miss Paul: We came into existence when the administration of\r\n    President Wilson first came in. We appealed to all members of\r\n    Congress to have this Amendment put through at once. We did get that\r\n    measure out upon the floor of the House and Senate, but when it came\r\n    to getting a vote in the House we found we were absolutely blocked.\r\n    We went again and again, week after week, and month after month to\r\n    the Democratic members of the Rules Committee, who controlled the\r\n    apportioning of the time of the House, and asked them to give us\r\n    five or ten minutes for the discussion of Suffrage. Every time they\r\n    refused. They told us that they were powerless to act because the\r\n    Democrats had met in caucus and decided that Suffrage was a matter\r\n    to be decided in the States and should not be brought up in\r\n    Congress. (Here Miss Paul, moving the papers in front of her, deftly\r\n    extracted a letter.) I have here a letter from Mr. Henry, Chairman\r\n    of the Rules Committee, in which he says: “It would give me great\r\n    pleasure to report the Resolution to the House, except for the fact\r\n    that the Democratic caucus, by its direct action, has tied my hands\r\n    and placed me in a position where I will not be authorized to do so\r\n    unless the caucus is reconvened and changes its decision. I am sure\r\n    your good judgment will cause you to thoroughly understand my\r\n    attitude.”\r\n\r\n    (This interesting revelation was greeted by appreciative grins from\r\n    the Republican members.)\r\n\r\n    After we had been met for months with the statement that the\r\n    Democratic Party had decided in caucus not to let Suffrage come up\r\n    in Congress, we said, “We will go out to the women voters in the\r\n    West and tell them how we are blocked in Washington, and ask them if\r\n    they will use their vote for the very highest purpose for which they\r\n    can use it—to help get votes for other women.”\r\n\r\n    We campaigned against every one of the forty-three men who were\r\n    running for Congress on the Democratic ticket in any of the Suffrage\r\n    States; and only nineteen of those we campaigned against came back\r\n    to Washington. In December, at the close of the election, we went\r\n    back to the Rules Committee. They told us then that they had no\r\n    greater desire in the world than to bring the Suffrage Amendment\r\n    out. They told us that we had misunderstood them in thinking that\r\n    they were opposed to having Suffrage come up in Congress. They voted\r\n    at once to bring Suffrage upon the floor for the first time in\r\n    history. The whole opposition of the Democratic Party melted away\r\n    and the decision of the party caucus was reversed.\r\n\r\n    The part we played in the last election was simply to tell the women\r\n    voters of the West of the way the Democratic Party had blocked us at\r\n    Washington and of the way the individual members of the Party, from\r\n    the West, had supported their Party in blocking us. As soon as we\r\n    told this record they ceased blocking us and we trust they will\r\n    never block us again.\r\n\r\n    Question: But what about next time?\r\n\r\n    Miss Paul: We hope we will never have to go into another election.\r\n    We are appealing to all Parties and to all men to put this Amendment\r\n    through this Congress and send it on to the State Legislatures. What\r\n    we are doing is giving the Democrats their opportunity. We did\r\n    pursue a certain policy which we have outlined to you as you\r\n    requested. As to what we may do we cannot say. It depends upon the\r\n    future situation.\r\n\r\n    Question: But we want to know what you will do in the 1916 election?\r\n\r\n    Miss Paul: Can you possibly tell us what will be in the platform of\r\n    the Democratic Party in 1916?\r\n\r\n    Mr. Webb: I can tell one plank that will not be there, and that is a\r\n    plank in favor of Woman Suffrage.\r\n\r\n    Question: If conditions are the same, do you not propose to fight\r\n    Democrats just the same as you did a year ago?\r\n\r\n    Miss Paul: We have come to ask your help in this Congress. But in\r\n    asking it we have ventured to remind you that in the next election\r\n    one-fifth of the vote for President comes from Suffrage States. What\r\n    we shall do in that election depends upon what you do.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Webb: We would know better what to do if we knew what you were\r\n    going to do.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Gard: We should not approach this hearing in any partisan sense.\r\n    What I would like is to be informed about some facts. I asked Mrs.\r\n    Field what reason your organization had for asking Congress to\r\n    submit this question to States that have already acted upon it. Why\r\n    should there be a resubmission to the voters by national action in\r\n    States which have either voted for or against it, when the machinery\r\n    exists in these same States to vote for it again?\r\n\r\n    Miss Paul: They have never voted on the question of a National\r\n    Amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Mr. Gard: The States can only ratify it. You would prefer that\r\n    course to having it taken directly to the people?\r\n\r\n    Miss Paul: Simply because we have the power of women’s votes to back\r\n    up this method.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Gard: You are using this method because you think you have power\r\n    to enforce it?\r\n\r\n    Miss Paul: Because we know we have power.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Taggart: The women who have the vote in the West are not\r\n    worrying about what women are doing in the East. You will have to\r\n    get more States before you try this nationally.\r\n\r\n    Miss Paul: We think that this repeated advice to go back to the\r\n    States proves beyond all cavil that we are on the right track.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Taggart: Suppose you get fewer votes this time? Do you think it\r\n    is fair to those members of Congress who voted for Woman Suffrage\r\n    and have stood for Woman Suffrage, to oppose them merely because a\r\n    majority of their Party were not in favor of Woman Suffrage?\r\n\r\n    Miss Paul: Every man that we opposed stood by his Party caucus in\r\n    its opposition to Suffrage.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Volstead: This inquiry is absolutely unfair and improper. It is\r\n    cheap politics, and I have gotten awfully tired listening to it.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Taggart: Have your services been bespoken by the Republican\r\n    committee of Kansas for the next campaign?\r\n\r\n    Miss Paul: We are greatly gratified by this tribute to our value.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Moss: State just whether or not it is a fact that the question\r\n    is, What is right? and not, What will be the reward or punishment of\r\n    the members of this committee? Is not that the only question that is\r\n    pending before this committee?\r\n\r\n    Miss Paul: Yes, as we have said over and over today. We have come\r\n    simply to ask that this committee report this measure to the House,\r\n    that the House may consider the question.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Moss: Can you explain to the committee what the question of what\r\n    you are going to do to a member of this committee or a Congressman\r\n    in regard to his vote has to do with the question of what we should\r\n    do as our duty?\r\n\r\n    Miss Paul: As I have said, we don’t see any reason for discussing\r\n    that.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Webb: You have no blacklist, have you, Miss Paul?\r\n\r\n    Miss Paul: No.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Taggart: You are organized, are you not, for the chastisement of\r\n    political Parties that do not do your bidding at once?\r\n\r\n    Miss Paul: We are organized to win votes for women and our method of\r\n    doing this is to organize the women who have the vote to help other\r\n    women to get it.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe meeting then adjourned.\r\n\r\nBefore going on with the work for 1916, it is perhaps expedient to\r\nmention here one of two interesting events. The _New York Tribune_\r\nannounced on November 5 that, “accepting the advice of Mrs. Medill\r\nMcCormick of Chicago, the National American Woman Suffrage Association\r\nannounced yesterday that it had instructed the Congressional Committee\r\nnot to introduce the Shafroth-Palmer Resolution in the Sixty-fourth\r\nCongress.” This meant, of course, that there would in the future be no\r\ndivision of the energies of the Suffrage forces of the country; that all\r\nwould work for the Susan B. Anthony Amendment.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   II\r\n\r\n               THE NEW HEADQUARTERS AND THE MIDDLE YEARS\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE second event of 1915 of less importance nationally, but of great\r\npractical importance to the Congressional Union, was the removal of\r\nHeadquarters from the dark, congested rooms in F Street to Cameron\r\nHouse, sometimes known as the Little White House. Cameron House has\r\nheld, ever since its construction, a vivid place in Washington history.\r\nIt has been occupied by Senator Donald Cameron; Vice-President Garret A.\r\nHobart; Senator Mark Hanna. The famous breakfasts given by Senator\r\nHanna, to which President McKinley often came, occurred here.\r\nPresidents, such as John Quincy Adams, Harrison, Taylor, and Fillmore;\r\nstatesmen, such as Webster, Clay, Cass, and Calhoun; historians, such as\r\nPrescott, Bancroft, and Washington Irving, have frequented it. The\r\nLittle White House is situated at 21 Madison Place, just across\r\nLafayette Square from the big White House. From the windows of the big\r\nWhite House could be seen great banners of purple, white, and gold,\r\nwaving at the windows of the Little White House.\r\n\r\nCameron House was charming inside and out. Outside, a great wistaria\r\nvine made in the spring a marvel of its façade, and inside a combination\r\nof fine proportions and a charming architectural arrangement of the\r\nrooms gave it that _gemütlich_ atmosphere necessary to a rallying spot.\r\nWhen you entered, you came into a great hall, from which a noble\r\nstaircase made an effective exit, and in which a huge fireplace formed a\r\nfocussing center. All winter long, a fire was going in that fireplace;\r\nthere were easy chairs in front of it, and straying off from it. The\r\nLittle White House became a place where people dropped in easily. This\r\nbig reception hall always held a gay, interesting, and interested group,\r\ncomposed of Party members resident there; sympathizers and workers who\r\nlived in Washington; people from all over the United States who had come\r\nto Washington on a holiday. The organizers were always returning from\r\nthe four corners of the country with a harvest of news and ideas and\r\nplans before starting off for new fields.\r\n\r\nPerhaps there is no better place than here to speak of the work of those\r\nremarkable young women—the organizers. It will be remembered that from\r\nthe time of the formation of the Congressional Committee to the time\r\nwhen the Senate passed the Anthony Amendment was about six years and a\r\nhalf. Yet in 1919, Maud Younger said to me, “There have been three\r\ngenerations of organizers in this movement.” That was true. Not that\r\nthey served their average of two years and left. Most of them who came\r\nto work for the Party stayed with it. It was only that, as the work\r\ngrew, developed, expanded, more organizers and even more became\r\nnecessary. And perhaps it is one of the chief glories of the Woman’s\r\nParty that these organizers came to them younger and younger, until at\r\nthe end they were fresh, beautiful girls in their teens and early\r\ntwenties.\r\n\r\nThe first group consisted of:\r\n\r\nMabel Vernon; Elsie Hill; Margaret Whittemore; Doris Stevens; Mrs.\r\nSinclair Thompson; Virginia Arnold.\r\n\r\nThe second group consisted of:\r\n\r\nIris Calderhead; Vivian Pierce; Beulah Amidon; Lucy Branham; Hazel\r\nHunkins; Clara Louise Rowe; Joy Young; Margery Ross; Mary Gertrude\r\nFendall; Pauline Clarke; Alice Henkel; Rebecca Hourwich.\r\n\r\nThe third group consisted of:\r\n\r\nJulia Emory; Betty Gram; Anita Pollitzer; Mary Dubrow; Catherine\r\nFlanagan.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties which lay in the path of the organizers cannot possibly\r\nbe exaggerated: the work they accomplished cannot possibly be estimated.\r\nTheir story is one of those sealed chapters in the history of feminism,\r\nthe whole of which will never be known. With her usual astuteness Alice\r\nPaul always chose young, fresh, convinced, inspiring, and inspired\r\nspirits. Always she preferred enthusiasm to experience. Before an\r\norganizer left Headquarters for parts unknown, Alice Paul talked with\r\nher for several hours, going over her route, indicating the problems\r\nwhich would arise and—in her characteristic and indescribable Alice Paul\r\nway—suggesting how they were to be met; holding always above these\r\ndetails the shining object of the journey; managing somehow to fill her\r\nwith the feeling that in spite of many obstacles, she would conquer all\r\nthese new worlds. “No matter,” she always concluded, “what other\r\nSuffragists may say about us, pay no attention to it; go on with your\r\nwork. Our fight is not against women.”\r\n\r\nSometimes these girls would come into towns where there not only existed\r\nno Suffrage organization but there had never been a Suffrage meeting.\r\nSometimes they would have a list of names of people to whom to go for\r\nhelp; sometimes not that. At any rate they went to the best hotel and\r\nestablished themselves there. Then they found Headquarters, preferably\r\nin the hotel lobby; but if not there, in a shop window. Next they saw\r\nthe newspapers. Inevitably it seemed—Alice Paul’s sure instinct never\r\nfailed her here—they were incipient newspaper women. From the moment\r\nthey arrived, blazing their purple, white, and gold, the papers rang\r\nwith them, and that ringing continued until they left. They called on\r\nthe women whose names had been given them, asked them to serve on a\r\ncommittee in order to arrange a meeting. At that meeting, to which\r\nNational Headquarters would send a well-known speaker, the work would be\r\nexplained, the aims of the Woman’s Party set forth, its history\r\nreviewed. When the organizer left that town, she left an organization of\r\nsome sort behind her. Alice Paul always preferred, rather than a large,\r\ninactive membership, a few active women who, when needed, could bring\r\npressure to bear from their State on Washington.\r\n\r\nIn the course of its history, the Woman’s Party has organized at some\r\ntime in every State of the Union.\r\n\r\nWhenever the organizers came back to Washington, Miss Paul always sent\r\nthem to the Capitol to lobby for a while. This put them in touch with\r\nthe Congressional situation. Moreover, Congressmen were always glad to\r\ntalk with women who brought them concrete information in regard to the\r\ncountry at large, and particularly in regard to the Suffrage sentiment\r\nand the political situation in their own States, which they had often\r\nnot seen for months. On the other hand, when the organizers embarked on\r\ntheir next journey, editors of small towns were always very grateful for\r\nthe chance of talking with these informed young persons, who could bring\r\ntheir news straight from the national news-mint.\r\n\r\nBut one of the great secrets of Alice Paul’s success was that she\r\nfreshened her old forces all the time, by giving them new work, brought\r\nnew forces to bear all the time on the old work. If organizers showed\r\nthe first symptoms of growing stale on one beat, she transferred them to\r\nanother. Most of them performed at some time during their connection\r\nwith the Woman’s Party every phase of its work. Perpetual change ...\r\nperpetual movement ... the onward rush of an exhilarating flood ... that\r\nwas the feeling the Woman’s Party gave the onlooker.\r\n\r\nI reiterate that it would be impossible to do justice, short of a book\r\ndevoted entirely to their efforts, to these organizers. They turn up\r\neverywhere. They do everything! They know not fatigue! There is no end\r\nto their ingenuity and enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all this intensive thinking, and its result in action, the\r\nCongressional Union had its lighter moments, and many of them.\r\n\r\nOn Valentine’s Day, 1916, a thousand Suffrage valentines were despatched\r\nto Senators and Representatives by members of the Congressional Union\r\nliving in their districts; the President and Vice-President were not\r\nforgotten. They were of all kinds and descriptions. Recalcitrant\r\npoliticians were especially favored. The Rules Committee, for instance,\r\nwere showered. One of Mr. Henry’s valentines took the form of an\r\nacrostic:\r\n\r\n                     H is for Hurry—\r\n                       Which Henry should do.\r\n\r\n                     E is for Every—\r\n                       Which includes women too.\r\n\r\n                     N is for Now—\r\n                       The moment to act.\r\n\r\n                     R is for Rules—\r\n                       Which must bend to the fact.\r\n\r\n                     Y is for You—\r\n                       With statesmanlike tact.\r\n\r\nMr. Pou’s valentine showed an exquisitely ruffled little maiden, with\r\nheel-less, cross-gartered slippers and a flower-trimmed hat, curtseying\r\nto a stocked and ruffled gentleman who is presenting her with a bouquet.\r\nUnderneath it says:\r\n\r\n                          The rose is red,\r\n                          The violet’s blue,\r\n                          But VOTES are better\r\n                          Mr. Pou.\r\n\r\nOne to Representative Williams of the Judiciary Committee ran:\r\n\r\n                    Oh, will you will us well, Will,\r\n                    As we will will by you,\r\n                    If you’ll only will to help us\r\n                    Put the Amendment through!\r\n\r\nRepresentative Webb’s valentine bore the words, “From a fond heart to a\r\nDemocratic (?) Congressman,” with the following verse:\r\n\r\n             Federal aid he votes for rural highways,\r\n             And Federal aid for pork each to his need;\r\n             And Federal aid for rivers, trees, and harbors,\r\n             But Federal aid for women?—No, indeed!\r\n\r\nRepresentative Fitzgerald received:\r\n\r\n                   Your Party’s health is very shaky,\r\n                   The Western women say,\r\n                   They scorn a laggard lover\r\n                   And will not tell him “Yea,”\r\n                   But pass the Suffrage measure,\r\n                   Then watch Election Day!\r\n\r\nCongressman Mondell’s valentine was a red heart, on which was written:\r\n\r\n            Oh, a young Lochinvar has come out of the West,\r\n            Of all the great measures his bill was the best!\r\n            So fearless in caucus, so brave on the floor\r\n            There ne’er was a leader like young Lochinvar!\r\n\r\nOn May Day, the Woman’s Party hung a May basket for the President. It\r\nwas over-brimming with purple, white, and gold flowers, and, concealed\r\nin their midst, was a plea for the Susan B. Anthony Amendment.\r\n\r\nLater, in May, on Representative Williams’s birthday, he was invited by\r\nRepresentative Kent to go with him into the visitors’ lobby. There he\r\nmet Gertrude and Ruth Crocker of the Congressional Union, who were\r\ncarrying on a tray, made of the Congressional Union banner and the\r\nAmerican flag, a huge birthday cake. It was frosted and set with\r\nfifty-nine candles, each emerging from a small, yellow rose and bore an\r\ninscription in purple letters:\r\n\r\n\r\n    May the coming year bring you joy and the Susan B. Anthony\r\n    Amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\nA few days later, when Representative Steele reached his office, he\r\nfound on his desk a purple basket filled with forget-me-nots. The card\r\nbore this inscription:\r\n\r\n              “Forget me not” is the message\r\n              I bring in my gladsome blue;\r\n              Forget not the fifty-six years that have gone\r\n              And the work there is still to do;\r\n              Forget not the Suffrage Amendment\r\n              That waits in committee for you.\r\n\r\nThe first National Convention of the Congressional Union was held at\r\nCameron House from December 6 to December 13, 1915. The following ten\r\nmembers were elected for the Executive Committee: Alice Paul; Lucy\r\nBurns; Mrs. O. H. P. Belmont; Mrs. John Winters Brannan; Mrs. Gilson\r\nGardner; Mrs. William Kent; Mrs. Lawrence Lewis; Elsie Hill; Anne\r\nMartin; Mrs. Donald R. Hooker.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  III\r\n\r\n               THE CONFLICT WITH THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE\r\n\r\n                              BOTHERATION\r\n\r\n(“Why do you come here and bother us?”—Chairman Webb, at the Suffrage\r\nhearing in Washington.)\r\n\r\n                  Girls, girls, the worst has happened;\r\n                    Our cause is at its ebb.\r\n                  How could you go and do it!\r\n                    You’ve bothered Mr. Webb!\r\n                  You came and asked for freedom,\r\n                    (As law does not forbid)\r\n                  Not thinking it might bother him,\r\n                    And yet, it seems, it did.\r\n\r\n                  Oh, can it be, my sisters,\r\n                    My sisters can it be,\r\n                  You did not think of Mr. Webb\r\n                    When asking to be free?\r\n                  You did not put his comfort\r\n                    Before your cause?

Anne\r\nMartin showed extraordinary ability in building back-fires in\r\nCongressional Districts, in keeping State and district chairmen informed\r\nof the actions of the representatives, in getting pressure from home\r\nupon them and in organizing the lobbying. Maud Younger, as chairman of\r\nthe Lobby Committee, composed of women voters, assisted her. Lucy Burns\r\nedited the _Suffragist_.\r\n\r\nThe friends of the Susan B. Anthony Amendment were surprised—and of\r\ncourse delighted—when through the tireless efforts of Anne Martin—the\r\nSuffrage Bill came out of committee and onto the calendar of the Senate\r\non January 8. In the House at first, the situation seemed equally\r\nencouraging. But unexpected obstacles manifested themselves; continued\r\nto multiply and grow. Presently there developed between the Judiciary\r\nCommittee and the Suffragists a contest similar to that of 1914 between\r\nthe Rules Committee and the Suffragists, but more intense.\r\n\r\nThe Judiciary Committee as usual referred the Amendment to a\r\nsub-committee. Anne Martin lobbied the members of the sub-committee and\r\nin consequence of this pressure, the sub-committee on February 9, voted\r\nthe report out—although without recommendation, to the full committee\r\nwhich would meet on February 15.\r\n\r\nAt this meeting, by a vote of nine to seven, the Judiciary Committee\r\nreferred the Suffrage Resolution back to the sub-committee with\r\ninstructions to hold it until December 14—nearly a year off. This was an\r\nunusual thing to do. After a sub-committee has reported a measure to the\r\ncommittee, it is customary to allow at least a week to elapse before it\r\nis acted upon, so that the members who are absent may be present when\r\nthe committee, as a whole, votes upon it. There is a gentleman’s\r\nagreement to this effect.\r\n\r\nIn her _Revelations of a Woman Lobbyist_, in _McCall’s Magazine_, Maud\r\nYounger thus describes the meeting of February 15:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The day ended as discouragingly as it had begun and I reported the\r\n    situation to Mr. John Nelson, of Wisconsin, the only man on the\r\n    committee who showed genuine enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n    “Your Amendment can’t come up tomorrow,” he assured me. “There’s a\r\n    gentleman’s agreement that no action shall be taken on a bill for a\r\n    week after the sub-committee reports it out. The matter lies over so\r\n    that the members may be notified to be present. Your Amendment will\r\n    come up next week.”\r\n\r\n    Relying on this reprieve, I felt no apprehension when Anne and I\r\n    went to the Capitol next morning. Standing in the anteroom of the\r\n    Judiciary Committee’s chamber, we watched the members passing\r\n    through. The committee went into executive session and the door\r\n    closed.\r\n\r\n    “There’s the gentleman’s agreement,” I said to Anne. “Nothing can\r\n    happen.”\r\n\r\n    “No,” she answered meditatively.\r\n\r\n    We waited. An hour passed and Mr. Carlin came out. He walked close\r\n    to Anne and said with a laugh as he passed her, “Well, we’ve killed\r\n    Cock Robin.”\r\n\r\n    “Cock Robin?” said Anne, puzzled, looking after him.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Nelson came out, much perturbed, and explained. Upon motion of\r\n    Mr. Carlin the Judiciary Committee had voted to send the Amendment\r\n    back to the sub-committee to remain until the following December.\r\n\r\n    This was in direct violation of the gentleman’s agreement but our\r\n    opponents had the votes, nine to seven, and they used them. Our\r\n    Amendment was killed. Every one on the committee said so. Every one\r\n    in Congress with whom we talked said so. The newspaper men said so.\r\n    Soon every one believed it but Alice Paul, and she never believed it\r\n    at all.\r\n\r\n    “That’s absurd!” she said impatiently. “We have only to make them\r\n    reconsider.”\r\n\r\n    At once she went over the list of our opponents to decide who should\r\n    make the move. “Why, William Elza Williams, of Illinois, of course.\r\n    He will do it.” She sent me to see him.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Williams was necessary not only for purposes of reconsideration,\r\n    but because, when he had changed his vote, we would have a majority\r\n    in committee. But he did not see the matter at all in the same light\r\n    in which Miss Paul saw it. He had not the least intention of\r\n    changing his vote. I pointed out that the women of Illinois, being\r\n    half voters, had some claims to representation, but he remained\r\n    obdurate.\r\n\r\n    When this was reported to Miss Paul she merely said, “Mr. Williams\r\n    will have to change his vote. Elsie Hill can attend to it.”\r\n\r\n    So Elsie, buoyant with good spirits, good health, and tireless\r\n    enthusiasm, pinned her smart hat on her reddish-brown hair and set\r\n    out through Illinois for Mr. Williams’s vote.\r\n\r\n    Presently the ripples of Elsie’s passing across the Illinois\r\n    prairies began to break upon the peaceful desk of Mr. Williams in\r\n    Washington. I found him running a worried hand through his hair,\r\n    gazing at newspaper clippings about Mr. Williams and his vote on the\r\n    Judiciary Committee. Resolutions arrived from Labor Unions asking\r\n    him to reconsider; letters from constituents, telegrams, reports of\r\n    meetings, editorials.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn March 8, a deputation of twenty members of the Congressional Union,\r\nled by Maud Younger, called on Representative Williams. I quote the\r\n_Suffragist_:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Mr. Williams received the women with cordiality and Miss Younger at\r\n    once laid before him the object of the visit.\r\n\r\n    “On the fifteenth of February,” said Miss Younger, “the\r\n    sub-committee reported out the Suffrage Amendment. We are told that\r\n    there is a gentleman’s agreement to the effect that when a\r\n    sub-committee reports, no action shall be taken that day but the\r\n    matter shall lie over for a week. Four of our supporters were absent\r\n    on the day of the report and the opposition sent the Amendment back\r\n    to sub-committee. There were nine votes cast in favor of sending it\r\n    back, and seven against. We feel that it was you who cast the\r\n    deciding vote, for if you had voted with supporters of Suffrage, the\r\n    vote would have been a tie, and the Amendment would not now be in\r\n    sub-committee.\r\n\r\n    “You told me that you were in favor of having this matter remain in\r\n    committee until December, because you felt it would be embarrassing\r\n    to some men who would run for office next fall. As a\r\n    trades-unionist, as well as a woman voter, I feel that the eight\r\n    million working women of this country are entitled to as much\r\n    consideration as are a few politicians.”\r\n\r\n    Miss Younger then introduced Mrs. Lowell Mellett, of Seattle,\r\n    Washington; Mrs. William Kent, of California; Mrs. Gilson Gardner,\r\n    Mrs. Charles Edward Russell, of Illinois; Anne Martin, of Nevada;\r\n    each of whom made an appeal to Mr. Williams to give his support to a\r\n    report from the Judiciary Committee during the present session.\r\n\r\n\r\nMiss Martin said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    You are in what seems to us a very undesirable position. You are a\r\n    Representative from a Suffrage State, from a State where women have\r\n    the right to vote for President. You are a professed Suffragist, yet\r\n    you are the only member of that committee who is a Suffragist and\r\n    who is in the position of having voted with the professed\r\n    anti-Suffragists against a hearing.... We urge you to do everything\r\n    in your power to reconsider the smothering of this resolution, and\r\n    bring up the question in committee again as soon as possible, to\r\n    report it to the House and then to leave to the Rules Committee the\r\n    question of what time it shall have for discussion in this session.\r\n    We urge this most earnestly.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Williams replied:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I am pleased to hear from you ladies and to know fully your side of\r\n    this case.\r\n\r\n    If I remember correctly the conversation you refer to in which I\r\n    spoke of some embarrassment—not to myself, but to some of my\r\n    colleagues—I think I stated the condition of the calendar and the\r\n    business of this session. I have not double-crossed anybody. I have\r\n    not taken any sudden change of front. I have told every\r\n    representative of the Suffrage organization who has visited me that\r\n    I do not favor a report at this first session of the Sixty-fourth\r\n    Congress. I gave, as my primary reason, the crowded condition of the\r\n    business of this Congress. I incidentally—sometimes in a\r\n    good-natured way, as I remember—stated that it did not embarrass me\r\n    to vote on the question because I was already on record, but it\r\n    might embarrass some of my colleagues. My real views have been that\r\n    Congress has duties in this, a campaign year, when all members hope\r\n    to leave at a reasonable time within which to make their campaign;\r\n    that this session is not a good time to take upon ourselves the\r\n    consideration of any unimportant question that can be disposed of\r\n    just as well at the next session.\r\n\r\n    With a campaign approaching and two national conventions in June, I\r\n    do not believe it wise for your cause to crowd this matter on now. I\r\n    do not believe that it would get that consideration that you will\r\n    get after the election and after these necessary matters—matters of\r\n    importance and urgent necessity—are disposed of.\r\n\r\n    I am opposed to smothering anything in committee. I do not propose\r\n    to smother this in committee. I intend, when I think it is the\r\n    proper time, to vote the Susan B. Anthony Amendment out and vote for\r\n    it in the House. Now that is my intention. I have not said that I\r\n    would not do so at this session. I think the strongest that I have\r\n    put it is that I would not do so unless the work of the session is\r\n    cleared away so that we can get to it.\r\n\r\n    Now I have said more than that. At any time that you get a full\r\n    attendance of the committee, or those absent represented by pairs so\r\n    that both sides are represented, and no advantage can be taken and\r\n    no criticism made of what takes place, whenever there is what is\r\n    equivalent to a full committee present, I am willing that the\r\n    committee shall again vote on the question and determine whether\r\n    they want it out now.\r\n\r\n    Miss Younger: Before the conventions will meet in June, Congress\r\n    will have been in session six months, and we ask you for only one\r\n    day out of the six months. Some of those other questions, such as\r\n    preparedness, are not ready to come before Congress.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Williams: You would not be satisfied with one day.\r\n\r\n    Miss Martin: That is all we had last time and we were satisfied.\r\n\r\n    Mrs. Russell: Whatever action Congress takes or does not take on\r\n    preparedness, we women will have to stand for it. Any program that\r\n    Congress puts through we shall be involved in. Isn’t that just one\r\n    more reason why we ought to have a vote promptly?\r\n\r\n    Mr. Williams: Yes, but you cannot get it in time for the emergency\r\n    that is now before us. I believe this: If women had full political\r\n    rights everywhere there would not be any war. But that cannot be\r\n    brought about in time for this emergency.\r\n\r\n    “We cannot conceive,” said one member of the delegation at this\r\n    juncture, “of any situation which will not permit of three-quarters\r\n    of an hour being taken on the floor of the House for a vote.”\r\n\r\n    Mr. Williams: We have no right to refuse to submit it. I would not\r\n    smother it in committee at all, but I believe the committee has a\r\n    right to exercise their discretion as to when it shall be\r\n    submitted.... How do you take my suggestion? I am willing that a\r\n    vote may be had at any time if there is the equivalent of a full\r\n    attendance of the committee. Can that be secured?\r\n\r\n    Miss Martin: I have been working with this committee for nearly\r\n    three months, and I do not know of any session at which they have\r\n    all been present. You impose upon us now a condition that you did\r\n    not exact when this Amendment was smothered.\r\n\r\n    I think that we must regard a motion to postpone until after\r\n    election as an action unfriendly to Suffrage.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Williams: It may be. I do not see how it can be.\r\n\r\n    “Last year,” a member of the delegation then reminded Mr. Williams,\r\n    “the Amendment was postponed and voted on immediately after the\r\n    elections were safely over. The plan now is to postpone it until\r\n    after the elections to the Sixty-fifth Congress are over and no\r\n    one’s election will be jeopardized. We do not like to have the vote\r\n    taken in each Congress immediately after election.”\r\n\r\n    Miss Martin: We are not saying anything with reference to a vote on\r\n    the floor of the House at this time. We are simply asking that the\r\n    Judiciary Committee perform its function and judge the bill on its\r\n    merits and make its report to the House. Does not that appeal to\r\n    you?\r\n\r\n\r\n    Mr. Williams: Yes, it does. I am told I am the only member of the\r\n    committee who voted to postpone the Amendment, who is a\r\n    Representative from a Suffrage State. Somehow or other you have put\r\n    the burden on me.\r\n\r\n    Miss Martin: You are. The burden is on you.\r\n\r\n    Miss Younger: If we could prove to you that with your vote we would\r\n    have a majority of the committee, would you be willing to vote to\r\n    report it out to the House?\r\n\r\n    Mr. Williams: There would be ten besides myself favorable to\r\n    reporting it out? Yes, if you have the ten.\r\n\r\n    Miss Martin: I have them right here. You are the eleventh. We have\r\n    those ten votes.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Williams: Well, I hope you have. May I ask you just to read\r\n    them?\r\n\r\n    Miss Martin: These are the ten who are for reporting the Amendment:\r\n    Representatives Thomas, of Kentucky; Taggart, of Kansas; Dale of New\r\n    York; Neely, of West Virginia; Volstead, of Minnesota; Nelson, of\r\n    Wisconsin; Morgan, of Oklahoma; Chandler, of New York; Dyer, of\r\n    Missouri, and Moss, of West Virginia. That makes ten.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Williams: And Mr. Williams will make eleven. When will it be\r\n    possible to get them all together?\r\n\r\n    Miss Martin: We were hoping to do that by tomorrow. Mr. Dale was\r\n    here but he has been called back to New York. Mr. Moss has been\r\n    seriously ill but has promised to attend the meeting tomorrow. I\r\n    will read the names of the men who are against a report. They are\r\n    all anti-Suffragists and you are classified with them:\r\n    Representatives Webb, of North Carolina; Carlin, of Virginia;\r\n    Walker, of Georgia; Gard, of Ohio; Whaley, of South Carolina;\r\n    Caraway, of Arkansas; Igoe, of Missouri; Steele, of Pennsylvania,\r\n    and, until now, yourself.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Williams: If a majority of the committee want to reconsider it I\r\n    will vote in favor of it.\r\n\r\n    Miss Martin: What would you do if we could only get ten Suffrage\r\n    members present tomorrow and they were a majority of those present?\r\n\r\n    Mr. Williams: Let us not make any further agreement. I have agreed\r\n    to your former proposition and I will stand by my word.\r\n\r\n    Miss Martin: We are sure you will.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the deputation had left his office Mr. Williams promised Miss\r\nYounger and Miss Martin that, whenever the requisite number of friends\r\nof Suffrage were present at a meeting of the Judiciary Committee, he\r\nhimself would move a reconsideration of the question.\r\n\r\nAgain I quote Miss Younger’s, _Revelations of a Woman Lobbyist_:\r\n\r\n\r\n    We now had a majority of one on the committee. We had only to get\r\n    the majority together. It seemed a simple thing to do, but it\r\n    wasn’t.\r\n\r\n    The number of things that could take a Congressman out of town on\r\n    Tuesday and Thursday mornings, the number of minor ailments that\r\n    could develop on those days was appalling. It seemed that every time\r\n    a Congressman faced something he did not want to do, he had a\r\n    headache.\r\n\r\n    Monday after Monday, Wednesday after Wednesday, we went from office\r\n    to office, inquiring solicitously about each man’s health. Was he\r\n    quite well? Did he have a headache or any symptoms of internal\r\n    disorders? Was his wife in good health? His children? Could any\r\n    business affairs arise to take him out of town next day?...\r\n\r\n    The weeks went by and we were not able to get our majority,\r\n    together.\r\n\r\n    “You think you’re going to bring that question up again,” said Mr.\r\n    Webb, the chairman. “No power on earth will do it. It’s locked up in\r\n    sub-committee till next December, and it’s going to stay there.”\r\n\r\n    This was repeated to Miss Paul. “Nonsense!” she said. “Of course it\r\n    will be brought up.”\r\n\r\n    But why should all this petty bickering, this endless struggling\r\n    with absurdities be necessary in order to get before Congress a\r\n    measure dealing with a question of public good? No man would run his\r\n    private business that way. Yet that is the way public business is\r\n    done.\r\n\r\n    Finally after weeks of working and watchful waiting I reported to\r\n    Anne on Wednesday that a majority of our members were in town and\r\n    well. We were jubilant. Early next morning we were before the doors\r\n    of the Judiciary Committee to see them file in. They arrived one by\r\n    one, solemn, nervously hurrying by, or smiling in an amused or\r\n    friendly way. Mr. Hunter Moss, our staunch friend, appeared. Mr.\r\n    Moss was dying of cancer. Though often too ill to leave his bed, he\r\n    asked his secretary to notify him whenever Suffrage was to come up\r\n    so that he might fight for it. Mr. Moss was our tenth man. We\r\n    recounted them anxiously. Ten supporters, ten opponents—where was\r\n    Mr. Dale of New York? I flew downstairs to his office—I don’t know\r\n    who went with me but I have a faint memory of red hair—and there he\r\n    was in his shirt sleeves calmly looking over his mail.\r\n\r\n    “Hurry!” we cried. “The committee is ready to meet. Every one’s\r\n    there except you!”\r\n\r\n    He reached for his coat but we exclaimed, “Put it on in the hall!”\r\n    and hurrying him out between us we raced down the corridor, helping\r\n    him with the coat as we ran, then into the elevator and up to the\r\n    third floor and to the committee room. We deposited him in one\r\n    vacant seat. Our majority was complete!\r\n\r\n    As we stood off and looked at our eleven men sitting there together,\r\n    gathered with so much effort and trial, no artist was ever prouder\r\n    of a masterpiece than we. We stood entranced surveying them until\r\n    Mr. Webb sternly announced that the committee would go into\r\n    executive session which meant that we must go.\r\n\r\n    In the anteroom other Suffragists gathered, also the newspaper men.\r\n    Every one said that in a few moments the Amendment would be reported\r\n    out. But the minutes ran into hours. Our suspense grew. Each time\r\n    those closed doors opened and a member came out we asked for news.\r\n    There was none. “Carlin’s got the floor.”\r\n\r\n    The morning dragged past. Twelve o’clock came. Twelve-thirty. One\r\n    o’clock. The doors opened. We clustered around our supporters and\r\n    eagerly asked the news.\r\n\r\n    Well, Carlin got the floor and kept it. He took up the time. It got\r\n    late and the members were hungry and wanted to go to luncheon, and\r\n    there would have been a lot of wrangling over the Amendment. So they\r\n    adopted Carlin’s motion to make Suffrage the special order of\r\n    business two weeks from today.\r\n\r\n    “It’s all right,” our friends consoled us. “Only two weeks’ delay!”\r\n\r\n    But why two weeks? And why had Mr. Carlin, our avowed and bitter\r\n    enemy, himself made the motion to reconsider, tacking to it the two\r\n    weeks’ delay, unless something disastrous was planned?\r\n\r\n    Now began a care and watchfulness over our eleven, in comparison to\r\n    which all our previous watchfulness and care was as nothing. Not\r\n    only did we know each man’s mind minutely from day to day, but we\r\n    had their constituents on guard at home.\r\n\r\n    Washington’s mail increased. One man said, “I wish you’d ask those\r\n    Pennsylvania ladies to stop writing me!” Mr. Morgan said, “My\r\n    secretary has been busy all day long answering letters from\r\n    Suffragists. Why do you do it? You know I’m for it.” Mr. Neely, at a\r\n    desk covered with mail, broke forth in wrath, eyes blazing, “Why do\r\n    you have all those letters written to me as though you doubted my\r\n    stand? I’m as unchangeable as the Medes and Persians!”\r\n\r\n    On the 27th of March, the day before the vote, telegrams poured in.\r\n    We stumbled over messenger boys at every turn in the House office\r\n    building. Late that afternoon as Anne and I went into Mr. Taggart’s\r\n    office we passed a postman with a great bundle of special-delivery\r\n    letters.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Taggart was last on the list. Every one else was pledged to be\r\n    at the meeting next day.\r\n\r\n    “Yes, I’ll be there,” said Mr. Taggart slowly and ominously. “But\r\n    I’ll be a little late.”\r\n\r\n    “Late!” We jumped from our seats. “Why, it’s the special order for\r\n    ten-thirty!”\r\n\r\n    “Well, I may not be very late. I’ve got an appointment with the\r\n    Persian Ambassador—Haroun al Raschid,” said he, and looked at each\r\n    of us defiantly.\r\n\r\n    We pleaded, but in vain. Without Mr. Taggart we had not a majority.\r\n    What could we do? We discussed it while we walked home in the crisp\r\n    afternoon air. There was no Persian ambassador in America, but a\r\n    _chargé d’affaire_, and his name was not Haroun al Raschid, but Ali\r\n    Kuli Kahn. We smiled at Mr. Taggart’s transparency, but we were\r\n    alarmed. Our Amendment hung on Mr. Taggart’s presence.\r\n\r\n    Suppose after all he did intend to consult Persia on some matter of\r\n    moment to Kansas? To leave no loop-hole unguarded, Mary Gertrude\r\n    Fendall next morning at nine o’clock took a taxi to the Persian\r\n    legation and left it on the corner. At ten o’clock she was to ring\r\n    the bell, ask for Mr. Taggart, drive him in haste to the Capitol and\r\n    deposit him in the midst of our majority. As she walked up and down,\r\n    however, the problem became acute, for how could she get him out of\r\n    the legation when he did not go in? At last, ringing the bell,\r\n    seeing one attaché and then another, she became convinced that\r\n    nothing was known of the Kansas Congressman in the Persian legation,\r\n    so she telephoned us at the Capitol.\r\n\r\n    This confirmed our fears. Every one else was present; Mr. Taggart\r\n    was not in his office; no one knew where he was. Ten-thirty came;\r\n    ten forty-five. There was nothing of the vanquished in the faces of\r\n    our opponents. Mr. Carlin grinned affably at all of us, and the grin\r\n    chilled us. We looked anxiously from one to another as the meeting\r\n    began. Ten supporters—ten opponents. Mr. Taggart, wherever he was,\r\n    had our majority. The minutes dragged. Our friends prolonged the\r\n    preliminaries. A stranger near me pulled out his watch. I leaned\r\n    over and asked the time. “Five minutes to eleven.” And just at that\r\n    moment, looking up, I saw Mr. Taggart in the doorway—Mr. Taggart,\r\n    very much of a self-satisfied, naughty little boy, smiling\r\n    triumphantly. That did not matter. Our majority was complete.\r\n\r\n    The committee went into executive session, and we moved to the\r\n    anteroom. “A few minutes and you’ll have your Amendment reported\r\n    out,” said the newspaper men. “It’s all over but the shouting.” The\r\n    situation was ours. Suffrage was the special order; nothing could be\r\n    considered before it, and we had a majority. As the moments passed\r\n    we repeated this, trying to keep up our courage. For time lengthened\r\n    out. We eyed the door anxiously, starting up when it opened. We\r\n    caught glimpses of the room. The members were not sitting at their\r\n    places, they were on their feet, shaking their fists.\r\n\r\n    “They’re like wild animals,” said one member who came out.\r\n\r\n    “But what’s happening?” There was no answer. The door closed again.\r\n\r\n    Slowly we learned the incredible fact. When the door had shut upon\r\n    us, Mr. Carlin immediately moved that _all constitutional amendments\r\n    be indefinitely postponed_.\r\n\r\n    Now there were many constitutional amendments before that committee,\r\n    covering many subjects: marriage, divorce, election of judges, a\r\n    national anthem, prohibition. Mr. Carlin, to defeat us, had thrown\r\n    them all into one heap. A man could not vote to postpone one without\r\n    voting to postpone them all. He could not vote against one without\r\n    voting against them all. Were these men actually adult human beings,\r\n    legislating for a great nation, for the welfare of a hundred million\r\n    people?\r\n\r\n    The motion threw the committee into an uproar. Our friends protested\r\n    that it could not be considered; Suffrage was the special order of\r\n    the day. Mr. Moss moved that the Suffrage Amendment be reported out.\r\n    The chairman ruled this out of order. Now there was a majority in\r\n    that committee for Suffrage and a majority for prohibition, but they\r\n    were not the same majority. One of the strongest Suffragists\r\n    represented St. Louis with its large breweries. If he voted against\r\n    postponing the Prohibition Amendment he could never again be\r\n    re-elected from St. Louis. Yet he could not vote to postpone it\r\n    without postponing Suffrage also.\r\n\r\n    Through the closed door came the sound of loud, furious voices. We\r\n    caught glimpses of wildly gesticulating arms, fists in air,\r\n    contorted faces. One o’clock approached. Mr. Moss came out and\r\n    crossed quickly to the elevator. We hurried after him.\r\n\r\n    “Indefinitely postponed,” he said indignantly, not wanting to talk\r\n    about it.\r\n\r\n    “But our majority?”\r\n\r\n    “We lost one.”\r\n\r\n    “Who?”\r\n\r\n    “I cannot tell.” He stepped into the elevator. The other men came\r\n    trooping out. Our defeat was irrevocable, they all said. Nothing\r\n    could be done until the following December.\r\n\r\n    “You see,” said Mr. Taggart, looking very jubilant for a\r\n    just-defeated Suffragist, “You women can all go home now. You\r\n    needn’t have come at all this session. But of course you women don’t\r\n    know anything about politics. We told you not to bring up Suffrage\r\n    before election. Next December, after election, we may do something\r\n    for you.”\r\n\r\n    Our opponents, secure in victory, grew more friendly; but as they\r\n    warmed, our supporters became colder. Mr. Chandler flatly refused to\r\n    stay with us.\r\n\r\n    “I’ve voted for your Amendment twice,” he said, “and I won’t vote\r\n    for it again this session. That’s final.”\r\n\r\n    I also heard rumors of Mr. Neely’s refusing to vote for it, so I\r\n    caught him in a corridor and hurried beside him, talking as I\r\n    walked.\r\n\r\n    “That true,” he said. “I won’t vote for it again this session. It’s\r\n    no use talking. I am as unchangeable as the Medes and Persians.”\r\n\r\n    “But that’s just what you said when you were receiving so many\r\n    letters that you thought we doubted you! You said nothing could——”\r\n\r\n    “I’ve got some bills of my own to get out of this committee,” said\r\n    he, waving aside the Medes and Persians. “I won’t get them out if\r\n    you keep bringing up this Suffrage. Good day.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIn commenting upon the action of the Judiciary Committee, Miss Alice\r\nPaul said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The action of the Democratic leaders at Washington in again blocking\r\n    the Suffrage Amendment by postponing indefinitely its consideration\r\n    in the Judiciary Committee is an additional spur to Suffragists to\r\n    press forward with their plan of going out through the Suffrage\r\n    States to tell the women voters—particularly those who are\r\n    supporting the Democratic Party—of the opposition which the Party is\r\n    giving to the Federal Amendment at Washington.\r\n\r\n    We have now labored nearly a third of a year to persuade the\r\n    Democratic leaders in Congress to allow the Amendment to be brought\r\n    before the members of the House for their consideration. The rebuff\r\n    in the committee today shows the necessity of not delaying longer in\r\n    acquainting the four million voting women with what is going on in\r\n    Congress.\r\n\r\n    Many months still remain, in all probability, before Congress\r\n    adjourns. We will do our utmost in these months to create such a\r\n    powerful party of voting women in the West as to make it impossible\r\n    for the Democratic leaders at Washington longer to continue their\r\n    course of refusing to let this measure come before the House for\r\n    even the few minutes necessary for discussion and a vote.\r\n\r\n\r\nMiss Younger says further:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The following Tuesday found me as usual in the Judiciary Committee\r\n    room. When I appeared in the doorway there was a surprised but\r\n    smiling greeting.\r\n\r\n    “You haven’t given up yet?”\r\n\r\n    “Not until you report our Amendment.”\r\n\r\n    For the first time Mr. Webb smiled. There was surprise in his voice.\r\n    “You women are in earnest about this.”\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   IV\r\n\r\n                     MORE PRESSURE ON THE PRESIDENT\r\n\r\n\r\nIN the meantime the work with the President was going on. Mr. Wilson was\r\nabout to make a speaking trip which included Kansas. This would be the\r\nfirst time since his inauguration that he would visit a Suffrage State.\r\n\r\nOn January 26, 1916, Mrs. William Kent and Maud Younger waited on the\r\nPresident to ask him to receive a delegation of women in a forthcoming\r\nvisit to New York. In presenting this request, Mrs. Kent sounded a note\r\nwhich was beginning to become the dominant strain in the Suffrage\r\ndemands of the western women.\r\n\r\n“Women are anxious to express to you, Mr. President,” she said, “the\r\ndepth of earnestness of the demand for Woman Suffrage. We as western\r\nwomen and as citizens are accustomed to having a request for political\r\nconsideration received with seriousness; and we feel keenly the\r\ninjustice of the popular rumor that such delegations are planned to\r\nannoy a public official. We hope that you will appreciate the dignity\r\nand propriety of such a representative appeal as the women of New York\r\nare now making.”\r\n\r\nPresident Wilson said that such an assumption was entirely absent from\r\nhis mind. He added that he had decided to make it a rule during his trip\r\nto New York and throughout the Middle West not to receive any\r\ndelegations whatever, since he would “get in wrong,” as he said, if he\r\nreceived one and not another; it was very possible, however, that he\r\nmight be approached by deputations which he would be able to receive.\r\n\r\nAs Mrs. Kent and Miss Younger came out from this call on the President,\r\nthe evening papers were on the stands. They announced that the next day\r\nin New York the President would receive fifteen hundred ministers.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of January 27, 1916, over a hundred women, organized by\r\nDoris Stevens and led by Mrs. E. Tiffany Dyer, assembled in the East\r\nRoom of the Waldorf Astoria Hotel. Fifteen minutes later they sent up a\r\nnote asking for a ten-minute audience with the President, that New York\r\nwomen might lay their case for federal action upon Suffrage before him.\r\nSecretary Tumulty sent back the following note:\r\n\r\n\r\n    For the President, I beg to acknowledge the receipt of your note\r\n    requesting a Conference with him to discuss the Suffrage Amendment.\r\n    I very much regret that the President’s engagements make it\r\n    impossible to arrange this matter as you have so generously\r\n    suggested. When a representative from your committee called at the\r\n    White House the President informed her of the crowded condition of\r\n    his calendar today.\r\n\r\n              JOSEPH TUMULTY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs this note merely said that no time had been set aside for a\r\ndeputation of women, and did not say that it would be impossible to see\r\nhim at all, a second note was sent, asking for just five minutes and\r\noffering to wait as long as necessary. In the meantime, an interview\r\nbetween Mr. Tumulty and Mrs. Amos Pinchot took place. Mrs. Pinchot\r\nreported to the deputation that the President and his Secretary were\r\n“conferring.” For two hours the women waited, holding a meeting. Some of\r\nthe women thought it was undignified to wait since the President had\r\nstated in his note that an appointment had not been secured.\r\n\r\n“But,” said Mrs. Carol Beckwith, “why quibble about our undignified\r\nposition here in the Waldorf? Our political position is undignified, and\r\nthat is what we should remedy.”\r\n\r\nAt a quarter past eleven, the President appeared.\r\n\r\nIn answer to the speeches of Mrs. Dyer, Mrs. Henry Bruere, Mary Ritter\r\nBeard, President Wilson said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I ought to say, in the first place, that the apologies, I think,\r\n    ought to come from me, because I had not understood that an\r\n    appointment had been made. On the contrary, I supposed none had been\r\n    made, and, therefore, had filled my morning with work, from which it\r\n    did not seem possible to escape.\r\n\r\n    I can easily understand the embarrassment of any one of your\r\n    representatives in trying to make a speech in this situation. I feel\r\n    that embarrassment very strongly myself, and I wish very much that I\r\n    had the eloquence of some of your speakers, so that I could set my\r\n    views forth as adequately as they set forth theirs.\r\n\r\n    It may be, ladies, that my mind works slowly. I have always felt\r\n    that those things were most solidly built that were built piece by\r\n    piece, and I felt that the genius of our political development in\r\n    this country lay in the number of our States, and in the very clear\r\n    definition of the difference of sphere between the State and Federal\r\n    Government. It may be that I am a little old-fashioned in that.\r\n\r\n    When I last had the pleasure of receiving some ladies urging the\r\n    Amendment that you are urging this morning, I told them that my mind\r\n    was unchanged, but I hoped open, and that I would take pleasure in\r\n    conferring with the leaders of my Party and the leaders of Congress\r\n    with regard to this matter. I have not fulfilled that promise, and I\r\n    hope you will understand why I have not fulfilled it, because there\r\n    seemed to be questions of legislation so pressing in their necessity\r\n    that they ought to take precedence of everything else; that we could\r\n    postpone fundamental changes to immediate action along lines in the\r\n    national interest. That has been my reason, and I think it is a\r\n    sufficient reason. The business of government is a business from day\r\n    to day, ladies, and there are things that cannot wait. However great\r\n    the principle involved in this instance, action must of necessity in\r\n    great fundamental constitutional changes be deliberate, and I do not\r\n    feel that I have put the less pressing in advance of the more\r\n    pressing in the course I have taken.\r\n\r\n    I have not forgotten the promise that I made, and I certainly shall\r\n    not forget the fulfillment of it, but I want to be absolutely frank.\r\n    My own mind is still convinced that we ought to work this thing out\r\n    State by State. I did what I could to work it out in my own State in\r\n    New Jersey, and I am willing to act there whenever it comes up; but\r\n    that is so far my conviction as to the best and solidest way to\r\n    build changes of this kind, and I for my own part see no reason for\r\n    discouragement on the part of the women of the country in the\r\n    progress that this movement has been making. It may move like a\r\n    glacier, but when it does move, its effects are permanent.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SUFFRAGIST’S DREAM. PRESIDENT WILSON: My dear young\r\nlady, you have saved my life. How can I thank you?\r\nNina Allender in _The Suffragist_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n    I had not expected to have this pleasure this morning, and therefore\r\n    am simply speaking offhand, and without consideration of my phrases,\r\n    but I hope in entire frankness. I thank you sincerely for this\r\n    opportunity.\r\n\r\n\r\nSmiling the President turned to leave the room, when Mrs. Beard reminded\r\nhim that the Clayton Bill, with its far-reaching effects on the\r\nworking-man, had not been gained State by State.\r\n\r\n“I do not care to enter into a discussion of that,” he said sharply.\r\n\r\nIn February, President Wilson visited Kansas in his “Preparedness Tour.”\r\nAs soon as it became known that he was coming to Topeka, the heads of\r\nvarious Civic and Suffrage organizations in Kansas telegraphed him,\r\nasking for an interview.\r\n\r\nSecretary Tumulty answered by telegram that the crowded condition of the\r\nTopeka program would not permit of this arrangement.\r\n\r\nThe Kansas women telephoned that they were sure the President could\r\nspare them five minutes, and they would await him at the State House,\r\nimmediately after the party arranged in his honor.\r\n\r\nWhen Secretary Tumulty alighted from the President’s car in Topeka, the\r\ninspired, swift, and executive Mabel Vernon met him with a note from the\r\nKansas women asking the President to see them. To do this, she had had\r\nto run the gauntlet of a large force of police, Secret Service men and\r\nthe National Guard.\r\n\r\nMr. Tumulty said that he could give no answer at that time, but that\r\nlater the delegation could telephone him at Governor Capper’s house,\r\nwhere President and Mrs. Wilson were entertained. Governor Capper was a\r\nstrong Suffragist. The women did call later, but Secretary Tumulty\r\nexplained then that it would be impossible for the President to see\r\nthem. After much talk, an arrangement was made that the delegation\r\nshould come to the Governor’s house at twenty minutes before one. The\r\nthermometer was at zero, and snow was falling, but the women waited\r\nbefore Governor Capper’s house for an hour. Finally the President came\r\nout. The delegation, following the purple, white, and gold, marched up\r\nthe steps in double file. Lila Day Monroe made a little speech, and\r\nhanded the President the petition. The President murmured:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “I appreciate this call very much.... I appreciate it very much....\r\n    I am much obliged, much obliged.... Pleased to meet you ...” he\r\n    repeated at intervals, but he gave no expression of opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the deputation of women had filed by, The President handed the\r\npetition to one of the Secret Service men, who buttoned it up in his\r\ninside pocket.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   V\r\n\r\n                       FORMING THE WOMAN’S PARTY\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE Congressional Union was now to undertake another gigantic task—the\r\nformation of a new political Party.\r\n\r\nFor this purpose, a conference of national officers, state officers,\r\nmembers of the Advisory Council of the Congressional Union from the\r\nunenfranchised States met at the Little White House April 8 and 9, 1916.\r\nBrilliant speeches were made by Anne Martin and Lucy Burns. Alice Paul\r\nsummed the whole matter up in her usual convincingly incisive and\r\nlogical way:\r\n\r\n\r\n    This is the third time we have called together the members of our\r\n    Advisory Council and our state and national officers to lay before\r\n    them a new project. The first time was at Newport when we proposed a\r\n    campaign against all Democratic candidates for Congress in the\r\n    Suffrage States. The second time was a year ago in New York when we\r\n    proposed to convert the Congressional Union into a national\r\n    organization with branches in the different States. Today we want to\r\n    lay another plan before you for your consideration—that is the\r\n    organization of a political Party of women voters who can go into\r\n    this next election, if it is necessary to go into it, as an\r\n    independent Party.\r\n\r\n    I think we are all agreed on certain essential points. First—from\r\n    what source our opposition comes. We are agreed that it comes from\r\n    the Administration. We do not have to prove that. Second—we are\r\n    agreed as to where our power lies—that is in the Suffrage States.\r\n    Third—we are agreed as to the political situation. We know that the\r\n    two Parties are about equal, that both want to win. We know that the\r\n    Suffrage States are doubtful States and that every one of those\r\n    States is wanted by the political Parties. We know that many of the\r\n    elections will be close. The State of Nevada was won by only forty\r\n    votes in the last Senatorial election. In Utah it was a week before\r\n    the campaign was decided. In Colorado, the same. Going back over a\r\n    period of twenty years it would have been necessary to have changed\r\n    only nine per cent of the total vote cast in the presidential\r\n    elections in order to have thrown the election to the other Party.\r\n    This gives us a position of wonderful power, a position that we have\r\n    never held before and that we cannot hope to hold again for at least\r\n    four years, and which we may not hold then.\r\n\r\n    We have been working for two years to effect an organization in the\r\n    Suffrage States and have finally completed such an organization. Our\r\n    last branch was formed about ten days ago in the State of\r\n    Washington. We now have to demonstrate to the Administration, to the\r\n    majority Party in Congress, that the organization in the Suffrage\r\n    States does exist and that it is a power to be feared. There are\r\n    many months still remaining, probably, before Congress will adjourn.\r\n    If in these months we can build up so strong an organization there\r\n    that it really will be dangerous to oppose it, and if we can show\r\n    Congress that we have such an organization, then we will have the\r\n    matter in our hands.\r\n\r\n    We have sent a request to our branches in the East to select one or\r\n    more representative women who will go out to the West and make a\r\n    personal appeal to the women voters to stand by us even more loyally\r\n    than they have before—to form a stronger organization than has ever\r\n    before existed.\r\n\r\n    Today we must consider what concrete plan we shall ask these envoys\r\n    who go out to the West to propose to the voting women. I do not\r\n    think it will do very much good to go through the voting States and\r\n    simply strengthen our Suffrage organizations. That will not be\r\n    enough to terrify the men in Congress. Suffrage organizations,\r\n    unfortunately, have come to stand for feebleness of action and\r\n    supineness of spirit. What I want to propose is that when we go to\r\n    these women voters we ask them to begin to organize an independent\r\n    political Party that will be ready for the elections in November.\r\n    They may not have to go into these elections. If they prepare\r\n    diligently enough for the elections they won’t have to go into them.\r\n    The threat will be enough. We want to propose to you that we ask the\r\n    women voters to come together in Chicago at the time that the\r\n    Progressives and Republicans meet there in June, to decide how they\r\n    will use these four million votes that women have, in the next\r\n    election.\r\n\r\n    Now, if women who are Republicans simply help the Republican Party,\r\n    and if women who are Democrats help the Democratic Party, women’s\r\n    votes will not count for much. But if the political Parties see\r\n    before them a group of independent women voters who are standing\r\n    together to use their vote to promote Suffrage, it will make\r\n    Suffrage an issue—the women voters at once become a group which\r\n    counts; whose votes are wanted. The Parties will inevitably have to\r\n    go to the women voters if the latter stand aloof and do not go to\r\n    the existing political Parties. The political Parties will have to\r\n    offer them the thing which will win their votes. To count in an\r\n    election you do not have to be the biggest Party; you have to be\r\n    simply an independent Party that will stand for one object and that\r\n    cannot be diverted from that object.\r\n\r\n    Four years ago there was launched a new Party, the Progressive\r\n    Party. It really did, I suppose, decide the last Presidential\r\n    election. We can be the same determining factor in this coming\r\n    election. And if we can make Congress realize that we can be the\r\n    determining factor, we won’t have to go into the election at all.\r\n\r\n    What I would like to propose, in short, is that we go to the women\r\n    voters and ask them to hold a convention in Chicago the first week\r\n    in June, and that we spend these next two months in preparation. We\r\n    could not have a better opportunity for preparation than this trip\r\n    of the envoys through every one of the Suffrage States, calling the\r\n    women together to meet in Chicago, the place where the eyes of the\r\n    whole country will be turned in June.\r\n\r\n    We want very much to know what you think about this plan and whether\r\n    you will help us in carrying it through. It is not an easy thing to\r\n    launch a new Party and have it stand competition with the Republican\r\n    and Democratic Parties. If we undertake it, we must make it a\r\n    success. We must make it worthy to stand beside these great Parties.\r\n    That is the biggest task that we have ever dreamed of since we\r\n    started the Congressional Union.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was unanimously decided by the Conference to send an appeal to all\r\nmembers in the Suffrage States to meet in Chicago on June 5, 6, and 7,\r\nto form a Woman’s Party. Envoys to carry this appeal to the West were\r\nelected.\r\n\r\nMrs. W. D. Ascough, Harriot Stanton Blatch, Abby Scott Baker, Lucy\r\nBurns, Agnes Campbell, Mrs. A. R. Colvin, Anna Constable, Edith Goode,\r\nJane Goode, Florence Bayard Hilles, Julia Hurlburt, Caroline\r\nKatzenstein, Winifred Mallon, Mrs. Cyrus Mead, Agnes Morey, Katherine\r\nMorey, Gertrude B. Newell, Mrs. Percy Read, Ella Riegel, Mrs. John\r\nRogers, Mrs. Townsend Scott, Helen Todd, Mrs. Nelson Whittemore.\r\n\r\nAll of these women were chosen by State groups of the National Woman’s\r\nParty; they therefore went to the West as the spokesmen of the\r\nunenfranchised women of their own States. Ahead of them went the\r\norganizers.\r\n\r\nThis Suffrage Special must not be confused with Hughes’ “Golden\r\nSpecial,” which in October—six months later—toured the West and with\r\nwhich the National Woman’s Party had no connection.\r\n\r\nFive thousand people gathered in the Union Station at Washington to see\r\nthe envoys off—what the _Washington Times_ describes as a\r\n“banner-carrying, flag-waving, flower-laden cheering crowd.” Automobiles\r\nflying the tri-color brought the envoys to the station. Two buglers\r\nsounded the assembly for the farewell. The Naval Gun Factory Band\r\ngreeted them with the _Marseillaise_, and in the half-hour before the\r\ntrain’s departure, it continued to play martial music. When it struck up\r\n_Onward Christian Soldiers_ and _America_, the crowd sang with them.\r\n\r\nThe envoys made a tremendous impression in the West. Whenever their\r\ntrain arrived—purple, white, and gold decorations floating from all the\r\nwindows—that arrival became an event and created excitement.\r\n\r\n\r\n    “I wish you might see some of these meetings,” Abby Baker wrote to\r\n    the _Suffragist_ of April 29, “and see the looks of amusement of the\r\n    men as our train pulls in, gay with our Congressional Union colors.\r\n    They invariably call out, ‘Here come the Suffragettes,’ but very\r\n    soon they are saying, ‘She’s all right,’ and ‘That’s straight lady,’\r\n    or some such approving phrase, and as the train pulls out of the\r\n    station, we hear, ‘Bully for you!’ ‘Good luck!’ and so forth.”\r\n\r\n    “At Williams, Arizona,” said another letter in the same number of\r\n    the _Suffragist_, “there was nothing in sight but a water tank, a\r\n    restaurant, a picture postal card shop, and yet we had a tremendous\r\n    meeting.”\r\n\r\n\r\nAt El Tova, in the same State, they carried the message of the\r\nunenfranchised women of the East to the very rim of the canyon, a mile\r\nbelow sea level!\r\n\r\nLeaving very early in the morning, at Maricopa they found a group of\r\nwomen waiting, who said plaintively, “Oh, if you could only stop longer,\r\nso that we might drum up all the women out of the sage brush!”\r\n\r\nIt was not the people alone or the civic authorities who made this trip\r\nof the envoys so attractive. When the Suffragists came to breakfast on\r\nthe road from Maricopa to Tucson, they found that the management of the\r\nrailway had decorated the breakfast tables in the dining car with\r\npurple, white, and gold—sweet peas and yellow laburnums. At Tucson,\r\nEugene Debs came with the crowd to meet them.\r\n\r\nAt a meeting in Cheyenne, Mrs. Blatch was presented with a framed copy\r\nof a facsimile of the Governor’s signature attached to the act\r\nenfranchising the women of Wyoming when the State came into the Union.\r\n\r\nIn San Francisco, where there was a large meeting in the Civic\r\nAuditorium, presided over by Gail Laughlin, Sara Bard Field spoke. At\r\nthe close of the meeting, she asked if the people present who put\r\nSuffrage before Party affiliations would say, “I will.” The audience\r\narose as one man, and answered roundly, “I will.”\r\n\r\nAt Sacramento, California, where they were given a reception and\r\nluncheon by the Chamber of Commerce, the annual fruit show was in\r\nprogress and the envoys were presented with an immense box of raisins\r\nand two boxes of Sacramento Valley cherries.\r\n\r\nAt Seattle, the station was decorated with Congressional Union banners;\r\nthe national colors; hanging baskets of flowers. A bugler called\r\ntogether the big crowd—including the Acting Mayor—which had gathered to\r\nwelcome the envoys.\r\n\r\n“Ladies,” Mrs. Blatch ended her speech, “we are here after your votes.”\r\nA man’s voice in the audience cried: “You’ll get them,” and when Mrs.\r\nBlatch said, “Men, we need yours too,” the whole crowd burst into\r\napplause.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the address, the envoys were taken on a tour of the\r\ncity in a procession of a hundred and fifty automobiles, all, of course,\r\nflying the purple, white, and gold. They attended court, where Seattle’s\r\nonly woman judge, a member of the Congressional Union, presided—Reah\r\nWhitehead.\r\n\r\nIt was in Washington State that the doctrine of Suffrage first reached\r\nwhat the _Suffragist_ described as “the height of its career.” Lucy\r\nBurns, as the guest of Flight Lieutenant Maroney of the Naval Militia at\r\nWashington, flew to a height of fourteen hundred feet over Seattle,\r\nscattering leaflets as she went. When she started, Miss Burns carried a\r\nCongressional Union banner, but the eighty-mile-an-hour gale soon tore\r\nit from her hand. When last seen, it reposed gracefully on the roof of a\r\nlarge Seattle mill. At Bellingham occurred one of the biggest\r\nout-of-door meetings the envoys had had. For a solid block, the street\r\nwas packed with people from one side to the other.\r\n\r\nAt Spokane, they participated in an interesting and rather poignant\r\nevent, the planting of a tree in memory of May Arkwright Hutton, pioneer\r\nSuffragist of Washington.\r\n\r\nAt Helena, Montana, a huge mass-meeting was held in the Auditorium. A\r\nsand storm, which had greeted their arrival, grew worse towards night,\r\nthe wind howling louder and louder. In the midst of Mrs. Rogers’s speech\r\nthe lights suddenly went out. She did not even hesitate, and in the\r\nabsolute darkness continued to urge women to stand by women. There was\r\nnot a sound from the audience; they listened in perfect quiet till the\r\nend.\r\n\r\nIn one State, the Governor declared the coming of the Suffrage Special a\r\nlegal holiday. Everything on wheels turned out to meet the envoys at the\r\ntrain, including the fire engine.\r\n\r\nA Convention at Salt Lake City on May 11 closed the swing of the\r\nSuffrage Special round the circle of the twelve free States, and brought\r\nthe Western tour to its highest stage of success. The envoys passed from\r\nthe station under a great purple, white, and gold flag, through a lane\r\nof women, their arms full of spring blossoms, to a long line of waiting\r\nautomobiles flying banners of purple, white, and gold.\r\n\r\nThe Convention passed resolutions demanding from Congress favorable\r\naction on the Suffrage Amendment in the present session and elected\r\nthree women voters to carry these resolutions to Congress.\r\n\r\nThese women accompanied the envoys to Washington. There they were\r\nwelcomed by a luncheon in the Union Station. Then, in automobiles,\r\nbrilliantly decorated, they drove through streets lined with huge\r\nposters which said COME TO THE CAPITOL. As they approached the Capitol,\r\ntwo buglers, from the broad platforms at the top of the high, wide\r\nstairway, alternately sounded a note of triumphant welcome. A huge\r\nchorus of women in white sang _America_. Through the aisle formed on the\r\nCapitol steps by ribbons held in the hands of other women in white, the\r\nenvoys passed up the steps into the Rotunda. In the Rotunda, they\r\ngrouped themselves into a semi-circle facing another semi-circle—nearly\r\na hundred Senators and Representatives. The Senate had taken a recess\r\nespecially to meet these women.\r\n\r\nThe envoys, elected at the Salt Lake City Convention, then presented to\r\nthe assembled Congressmen the resolutions passed at that Convention and\r\nspeeches followed.\r\n\r\nWhile the envoys were rousing the West, the Congressional Union was\r\nsending deputations to great political leaders in the hope of getting\r\ndeclarations of support which would influence the coming National\r\nPolitical Conventions. To a deputation consisting of Mary Beard,\r\nElizabeth Gerberding, Alice Carpenter, and Mrs. Evan Evans, Theodore\r\nRoosevelt, who had long been converted to the principle of Suffrage,\r\nannounced himself in favor of the Federal Amendment and promised his\r\nactive support in the campaign. This was of course an encouraging\r\nepisode in the story of the National Amendment.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThree weeks later came the next important event in the history of the\r\nCongressional Union—the launching of a Woman’s Party on July 5 at the\r\nBlackstone Theatre in Chicago. At this time Chicago was the center of\r\npublicity; the strategic point as far as the press was concerned. The\r\nWoman’s Party Convention met before the Conventions of the Republicans\r\nand Democrats. The reporters, gathered there and waiting in idleness for\r\nthese later occasions, looked upon the Woman’s Party Convention as a\r\ngift of the gods.\r\n\r\nHelena Hill Weed presented a report of the Credentials Committee, of\r\nwhich she was Chairman. She said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    This is not a delegated body.\r\n\r\n    It is a mass convention of all members of the Congressional Union to\r\n    form a Woman’s Party, made up of enfranchised women of the eleven\r\n    full Suffrage States, and of Illinois, where women may vote for\r\n    President of the United States.\r\n\r\n    There are two classes of delegates in this convention—members of the\r\n    Union in these twelve Suffrage States, who have the right to speak\r\n    and vote in the convention; and members of the Union in the\r\n    thirty-six unfree States, who may speak from the floor, but may not\r\n    vote.\r\n\r\n    As registration is still going on, it is impossible to give a final\r\n    vote of the number of delegates attending. Over fifteen hundred\r\n    delegates have already registered.\r\n\r\n\r\nMaud Younger was temporary Chairman of the Convention and keynote\r\nspeaker. She said in part:\r\n\r\n\r\n    A new force marches on to the political field. For the first time in\r\n    a Presidential election women are a factor to be reckoned with. Four\r\n    years ago, women voted in six States—today in twelve, including\r\n    Illinois. These States with their four million women constitute\r\n    nearly one-fourth of the electoral college and more than one-third\r\n    of the votes necessary to elect a President. With enough women\r\n    organized in each State to hold the balance of power, the women’s\r\n    votes may determine the Presidency of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Woman’s Party has no candidates and but one plank, the\r\n    enfranchisement of the women of America through a Federal Amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnne Martin was chosen permanent Chairman of the Party; Phœbe A. Hearst,\r\nJudge Mary A. Bartelme, Vice-Chairmen; Mabel Vernon, Secretary.\r\n\r\nThe Party platform, adopted unanimously amid cheers, reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The National Woman’s Party stands for the passage of the Amendment\r\n    to the United States Constitution known as the Susan B. Anthony\r\n    Amendment, proposing an Amendment to the Constitution of the United\r\n    States extending the right of Suffrage to women:\r\n\r\n    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\n    States of America in Congress assembled (two-thirds of each House\r\n    concurring therein) that the following article be proposed in the\r\n    legislatures of the several States as an Amendment to the\r\n    Constitution of the United States, which, when ratified by\r\n    three-fourths of the said legislatures, shall be valid as part of\r\n    such Constitution, namely:\r\n\r\n    Article 1, Section 1. The right of citizens of the United States to\r\n    vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any\r\n    State on account of sex.\r\n\r\n    Section 2. Congress shall have power, by appropriate legislation, to\r\n    enforce the provisions of this article.\r\n\r\n    The National Woman’s Party, convinced that the enfranchisement of\r\n    women is the paramount issue, pledges itself to use its united vote\r\n    to secure the passage of the Susan B. Anthony Amendment,\r\n    irrespective of the interests of any national political Party, and\r\n    pledges its unceasing opposition to all who oppose this Amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\nSara Bard Field closed that first meeting with an eloquent invocation to\r\nthe spirit of freedom, quoting from Alfred Wallace the words he used\r\njust before his death:\r\n\r\n\r\n    All my long life and investigations have shown me that there is one\r\n    supreme force needed in the universe for growth, either material or\r\n    spiritual, physical or mental—and that force is freedom.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn evening session of the Woman’s Party Convention, held also at the\r\nBlackstone Theatre, was made interesting and picturesque by the presence\r\nof representatives of all the political Parties.\r\n\r\nThe Convention appointed women representing the Woman’s Party, to speak\r\nat the Republican, Democratic, and Progressive Conventions.\r\n\r\nIncidental to the Convention a big “Suffrage First” luncheon was given\r\nin the Auditorium Hotel. So many hundreds of applicants for tickets had\r\nto be refused that finally tickets of admission for standing room were\r\nsold. Every inch of steps was occupied when the luncheon began.\r\nRemarkable speeches were made by Rheta Childe Dorr, the famous\r\npublicist, and one of the early editors of the _Suffragist_; by Crystal\r\nEastman, one of the founders of the Congressional Union, brilliant\r\nspeaker, writer, and editor; Inez Milholland Boissevain, who, before the\r\nyear was out, was to end, with such tragic abruptness, a vivid and\r\ndevoted life; Helen Keller, whose unexampled achievement is known to the\r\nwhole world.\r\n\r\nThe publicity which the Woman’s Party received was extraordinary. The\r\nConvention lasted three days and the meetings were packed. Arthur\r\nBrisbane pointed out the difference between the clock-like organization\r\nof the women and the hap-hazard organization of the men.\r\n\r\nIda M. Tarbell, describing the Woman’s Party in the _New York World_ of\r\nJune 7 and 8, 1916, says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The new Woman’s Party had permitted representation of five different\r\n    political Parties to appear before them and briefly present their\r\n    various claims to the Suffrage of women. “We do not ask you here to\r\n    tell us what we can do for your Parties, but what your Parties can\r\n    do for us,” Miss Martin told the speakers in a tone of exultant\r\n    sweetness which sent a cheer from shore to shore of the human sea\r\n    that filled the house....\r\n\r\n    “Votes don’t matter,” Benson shouted at them, “nothing but education\r\n    matters. Women, like men, don’t know how to vote. Nevertheless, if\r\n    you have nothing but ignorance you have a right to contribute that.\r\n    As for the Socialists, we shall continue to vote for Suffrage, as we\r\n    always have done, if no women vote for us.”\r\n\r\n    Much as they gasped at Benson’s defiance of their “power,” they took\r\n    it like sports, and sent him to his seat with rounds of cheers and\r\n    long waving of their lovely banners. (They have a wonderful eye for\r\n    color, these new politicians.)\r\n\r\n    But when Mr. Hammond—confident and bland—assured them the Republican\r\n    Party offered them protection from invaders, they jeered at him. He\r\n    did not understand that they are their own protectors and war scares\r\n    are not going to stampede them.\r\n\r\n    Another thing that the gentlemen must have noticed—used as they are\r\n    to the same game—and that was, that no amount of eloquence made the\r\n    faintest scratch on the rock-ribbed determination of the women. The\r\n    one and only thing they wanted to know, so the women told the men\r\n    after they had gone through their ordeals, was whether or no they\r\n    proposed to support the Susan B. Anthony Amendment. That was the\r\n    only possible interest they had in what the gentlemen could say. Was\r\n    it, yes or no?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Republican and Progressive Conventions began in Chicago the day the\r\nWoman’s Party Convention ended. The delegates elected by the women spoke\r\nbefore the Resolution Committee of both these Conventions.\r\n\r\nThe hearing before the Republicans was held in the vast Coliseum.\r\nRepresentatives of the National American Woman Suffrage Association\r\naddressed the Committee. Anti-Suffragists followed. In closing, their\r\nlast speaker said:\r\n\r\n“We will now leave you to the tender mercies of those who demand.”\r\n\r\nThe Woman’s Party then took the hearing in charge.\r\n\r\nThe hearing of the Woman’s Party before the Progressive Convention was\r\nheld at eight o’clock the same evening in the South Parlor of the\r\nAuditorium Hotel.\r\n\r\nLater, members of the Woman’s Party went to St. Louis where the\r\nDemocrats were holding their Convention. When they arrived they found\r\nthere was no room in the hotel which could be used for Headquarters.\r\nMost of them, a little discouraged, went in to breakfast. While they sat\r\nat the table, a newspaper man approached. “Where are your Headquarters?”\r\nhe asked. “Here,” Alice Paul answered instantly. After breakfast she\r\nchose a table in a conspicuous part of the hotel lobby; covered it with\r\nWoman’s Party literature, hung a purple, white, and gold banner back of\r\nit. The hotel, seething with the activity due to the fact that\r\nDemocratic Headquarters was there, took no notice of what she was doing.\r\nNobody said anything to her. Gradually Alice Paul hung purple, white,\r\nand gold banners everywhere in that corner of the lobby. Nobody\r\nremonstrated. Perhaps by this time, the hotel authorities decided that\r\nher color scheme was decorative. At any rate, the Woman’s Party\r\nmaintained that corner as Headquarters. It was a conspicuous spot;\r\neverybody had to pass it to go to the elevator. They could not have\r\nhired a place so advantageously situated.\r\n\r\nNewspaper cartoonists began to introduce the new Party into their\r\npictures. Alice Paul in the figure of a little deer, big-eyed and\r\nwistful, stood timidly among a group which included the elephant, the\r\ndonkey and the bull moose.\r\n\r\nThe Woman’s Party found every sentiment in favor of Suffrage among the\r\nDemocratic delegates until Secretary of War Baker arrived from\r\nWashington bringing the platform drawn up by Wilson. Then the atmosphere\r\nchanged. Newspaper men, who told the Woman’s Party delegates of the\r\nencouraging condition earlier, now said: “There is no chance of getting\r\nwhat you want.”\r\n\r\nWhen later the Resolutions Committee met, representatives from the\r\nWoman’s Party waited all night outside the door in a last effort to\r\ninfluence the members of the Committee going in and out of the Committee\r\nRooms. The entire platform was accepted, with very slight changes, as it\r\nhad been originally drafted in Washington. It contained a recommendation\r\nthat the question of Woman Suffrage be confined to the States.\r\n\r\nThe Progressives endorsed National Suffrage. This was the first time a\r\nnational political Party had ever endorsed the Federal Amendment; for\r\nalthough the Progressives, the Socialists, and the Prohibitionists had\r\nendorsed the principle of Suffrage in 1912, they had apparently never\r\nheard of the principle of Federal Suffrage. The platforms of the other\r\ntwo Parties were unsatisfactory as far as the Federal Amendment was\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\nThe Republican Suffrage plank was:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Republican Party, reaffirming its faith in a government of the\r\n    people, by the people, and for the people, as a measure of justice\r\n    to one-half the adult population of this country, favors the\r\n    extension of Suffrage to women, but recognizes the right of each\r\n    State to settle this question for itself.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Democratic Suffrage plank ran:\r\n\r\n\r\n    We recommend the extension of the franchise to the women of the\r\n    country by the States upon the same terms as to men.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese two planks also marked a great advance; for it was the first time\r\nthe major political Parties had ever mentioned Suffrage.\r\n\r\nNow every effort of the Woman’s Party was directed to getting the\r\nPresidential candidates, Wilson and Hughes, to come out for National\r\nSuffrage.\r\n\r\nAlice Paul’s campaign, conducted on Hughes, was particularly vigorous.\r\nIt was nation-wide in its extent. She sent telegrams all over the\r\ncountry asking people to urge this upon him. She sent numberless women\r\nto plead with Hughes. She sent women to Roosevelt and to other prominent\r\nRepublicans and Progressives to get them to use their influence with\r\nHughes. Every Republican member of Congress was lobbied to write to\r\nHughes or to see him.\r\n\r\nHughes found himself bombarded. Letters inundated him from all over the\r\nnation. Newspapers besieged him with editorials. Most important of all,\r\nAlice Paul herself went to him. Then it was that she presented an\r\nunanswerable argument which has already been quoted.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Your Party consists of two factions, the old stand-pat Republicans\r\n    and the Progressives. Now if you put a Suffrage plank in your\r\n    platform, you will not alienate the Progressives, because the\r\n    Progressives have a Suffrage plank and the old stand-pat Republicans\r\n    will not vote for a Democrat, no matter what you put in your\r\n    platform.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt a great mass-meeting in Carnegie Hall, Hughes accepted the\r\nnomination. He did not, however, satisfactorily mention Woman Suffrage.\r\nThat evening an unknown man came up to the box where Alice Paul was\r\nsitting and introducing himself as Hughes’s representative, asked her\r\nwhat she thought of the program. “Utterly unsatisfactory,” said Alice\r\nPaul; “it did not mention Federal Suffrage.” That night Alice Paul and\r\nother Suffragists went early to the public reception given to Hughes at\r\nthe Hotel Astor. They told every Senator, Congressman, and plain\r\nindividual whom they knew there: “When you congratulate Mr. Hughes, tell\r\nhim how disappointed you were that he did not mention Federal Suffrage.”\r\n\r\nIn a telegram sent on August 1 to Senator Sutherland of Utah, Hughes\r\ndeclared himself in favor of the Federal Amendment. It was the first\r\ntime any Presidential candidate of either of the two big political\r\nParties had publicly declared the Federal Amendment a part of his\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn June 19, President Wilson sent to Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, president\r\nof the National American Woman Suffrage Association, the following\r\nletter, which is a reply to a telegram from her asking what the Suffrage\r\nplank in the Democratic platform meant:\r\n\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR MRS. CATT:\r\n\r\n    I was away from the city and did not get your telegram of June\r\n    sixteenth promptly.\r\n\r\n    I am very glad to make my position about the Suffrage plank adopted\r\n    by the convention clear to you, though I had not thought that it was\r\n    necessary to state again a position I have repeatedly stated with\r\n    entire frankness. The plank received my entire approval before its\r\n    adoption and I shall support its principle with sincere pleasure. I\r\n    wish to join my fellow-Democrats in recommending to the several\r\n    States that they extend the Suffrage to women upon the same terms as\r\n    to men.\r\n\r\n              Cordially and sincerely yours,\r\n\r\n                        WOODROW WILSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   VI\r\n\r\n                  STILL MORE PRESSURE ON THE PRESIDENT\r\n\r\n\r\nON June 12, 1916, Sara Bard Field sent a telegram to President Wilson.\r\nMrs. Field was a Democrat, but she was, first of all, a Suffragist. In\r\nthat telegram, she urged the President to support the Suffrage\r\nAmendment. She promised, if the Democratic Party would do this, that she\r\nherself would gladly campaign for him in the Western States without\r\nremuneration. She promised him also the services of at least five other\r\ninfluential Democratic women. The President answered:\r\n\r\n\r\n    DEAR MRS. FIELD:\r\n\r\n    Your frank and kindly telegram of June 12 sent from St. Louis was\r\n    warmly appreciated. I have been in frequent conference with my Party\r\n    associates about a platform declaration with regard to Woman\r\n    Suffrage and sincerely hope the outcome has been acceptable to you.\r\n\r\n    In haste, with sincerest appreciation,\r\n\r\n              Cordially yours,\r\n\r\n                   WOODROW WILSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn June 21, President Wilson received Mrs. D. E. Hooker of Richmond, who\r\ncame to him as a delegate from the Virginia Federation of Labor. Mrs.\r\nHooker placed in the President’s hands resolutions passed by the\r\nFederation, demanding favorable action on the Federal Amendment this\r\nsession.\r\n\r\n“This is very strong,” said President Wilson.\r\n\r\nThe _Suffragist_ of July 1 says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Mrs. Hooker then urged upon the President, very movingly, the\r\n    humiliation, from the standpoint of a Southerner and a woman, of\r\n    going before the entire population of men now enfranchised, and\r\n    begging them each personally to approve of woman’s right to full\r\n    citizenship. Tears came into her eyes as she spoke, and the\r\n    President seemed rather touched. He said consolingly that she must\r\n    not mind the criticism she encountered in a good work. “Every one in\r\n    the public eye,” the President said, “is deluged with criticism. You\r\n    simply must do what you believe to be right.”\r\n\r\n    Mrs. Hooker went on to explain the political difficulties of the\r\n    State by State road to National Woman Suffrage.\r\n\r\n    President Wilson seemed very little impressed by these facts. “Every\r\n    good thing,” he said, “takes a great deal of hard work.”\r\n\r\n    Mrs. Hooker made a very strong point of the indefensible behavior of\r\n    the House Judiciary Committee in blocking the Suffrage Amendment and\r\n    refusing to allow the representatives of the people an opportunity\r\n    to vote upon it. “Whatever one may think of Woman Suffrage,” she\r\n    said, “tying the Amendment up this way before an election is wrong;\r\n    and the blame will fall squarely on the Democratic Party.”\r\n\r\n    “You must see the members of the Judiciary Committee about that,”\r\n    said the President, with a considerable tactical skill. “I do not\r\n    think I should interfere with the action of a Committee of\r\n    Congress.”\r\n\r\n    “Have you never done it before, Mr. President?” asked Mrs. Hooker.\r\n    The President explained that he had done it only under pressure of a\r\n    national emergency.\r\n\r\n    The interview lasted about half an hour. The President’s manner was\r\n    kindly and friendly, but he made it very plain that he interpreted\r\n    the Democratic platform plank to mean the limitation of the Suffrage\r\n    movement to State activities, and that he was still opposed to the\r\n    Federal Suffrage Amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\nLater, Mrs. Field replied to the President’s letter:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I am sorry to have to tell you that not only is the platform\r\n    declaration not acceptable to me, and to hundreds of thousands of\r\n    voting women of the West, but that we also greatly deprecate the\r\n    interpretation which you gave of this plank to Mrs. D. E. Hooker of\r\n    Richmond.\r\n\r\n    It is my sincere hope as a Democratic woman that you will not allow\r\n    any menace to the Democratic Party in the fall election through your\r\n    unwillingness to face the desire of the West for speedy action upon\r\n    the Susan B. Anthony Amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn July 3, a delegation representing the Woman’s National Democratic\r\nLeague, composed, according to the _Washington Times_, of some of the\r\nmost distinguished ladies of the Congressional and official sets, went\r\nto inform the President that the League had raised a thousand dollars as\r\na contribution towards his re-election. Afterwards, Mrs. F. B. Moran, a\r\ngrand-niece of Martha Washington, and it may be almost unnecessary to\r\nstate, a member of the Congressional Union, requested a five minute\r\ninterview with the President.\r\n\r\nMrs. Moran said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I am really afraid for my Party. The women in the West are far\r\n    superior to us. They have power, and they know how to use it. There\r\n    are four million of them, and they are heartily in favor of the\r\n    Federal Suffrage Amendment because they do not wish to be\r\n    disfranchised when they pass beyond the limits of their own State.\r\n    It is not a question of their threatening us. It is a question of\r\n    our realizing what they are going to do. You can get the Suffrage\r\n    Amendment through Congress, and, if you do not do it, these women\r\n    will regard you as responsible.\r\n\r\n\r\nPresident Wilson said, in answer, that he could not interfere with the\r\naction of Congress. He believed that Suffrage should be established on\r\nthe secure foundation of separate State action. “You should work from\r\nthe bottom up, not from the top down,” the President said. “Women should\r\nbe patient, and continue to work in the admirable way they have worked\r\nin the past.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn July 4, President Wilson reviewed a Labor parade in connection with\r\nthe laying of the corner-stone of the Labor Temple of the American\r\nFederation of Labor in Washington, D. C., and at its close he addressed\r\nthe marchers. He had just declared that he stood for the interests of\r\nall classes, when Mabel Vernon, who sat on the platform a few feet away,\r\ncalled in a voice which has a notably clear, ringing quality, “Mr.\r\nPresident, if you sincerely desire to forward the interests of all the\r\npeople, why do you oppose the national enfranchisement of women?”\r\n\r\nThe President answered, “That is one of the things which we will have to\r\ntake counsel over later.”\r\n\r\nWhen the President was closing his speech, Mabel Vernon called again;\r\n“Answer, Mr. President, why do you oppose the national enfranchisement\r\nof women?”\r\n\r\nThe President did not answer.\r\n\r\nThe Secret Service men with almost an exquisite courtesy gently hurried\r\nMiss Vernon away.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn July 24, another deputation of prominent Democratic women called on\r\nthe President. The deputation included Mrs. George W. Lamont, Harriot\r\nStanton Blatch, Mina Van Winkle, Helen Todd. I quote the _Suffragist_:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Mrs. Lamont, who introduced the group to President Wilson, said: “I\r\n    have come to you, Mr. President, as a Democratic woman. I used to be\r\n    first a Democrat and then a Suffragist; now I am a Suffragist\r\n    first.” She asked the President if he realized how painful a\r\n    position he created for Democratic women when he opposed the\r\n    enfranchisement of their sex and forced them to choose between their\r\n    Party allegiance and their loyalty to women throughout the nation.\r\n\r\n    Mrs. Blatch told President Wilson of the strength of the sentiment\r\n    for Woman Suffrage she had found in the West on her recent trip in\r\n    the Suffrage Special through the equal Suffrage States and of the\r\n    extraordinary difficulties she had experienced in her own life\r\n    trying to win Suffrage by amending the constitution of her State.\r\n\r\n    “I am sixty years old, Mr. President,” said Mrs. Blatch, “I have\r\n    worked all my life for Suffrage; and I am determined that I will\r\n    never again stand up on the street corners of a great city appealing\r\n    to every Tom, Dick, and Harry for the right of self-government. When\r\n    we work for a Federal Amendment, we are dealing at last with men who\r\n    understand what we are talking about and can speak to us in our\r\n    tongue. We are not asking for an easy way to win the vote. It is not\r\n    easy to amend the United States Constitution. We are asking for a\r\n    dignified way; and we ought to be able to rely on the chivalry of\r\n    our representatives, particularly of the southern representatives,\r\n    to accord to women a self-respecting method of working out their\r\n    enfranchisement.”\r\n\r\n    Miss Helen Todd told the President of her experience in a State\r\n    campaign in Texas, when Democratic members of the Legislature\r\n    refused to submit the question to the voters, saying bluntly that\r\n    they controlled eleven votes in the upper house and that those\r\n    eleven could keep the Suffrage Amendment “tied up” indefinitely.\r\n    “Women go to Democrats in Congress and are told they must appeal to\r\n    State Legislatures. They go to Democratic State Legislatures, who\r\n    refuse to allow the electors of their own State to vote upon the\r\n    question at all. What are women to do, Mr. President?” said Miss\r\n    Todd, “when they are played with in this cat and mouse fashion?”\r\n\r\n    The interview was in many respects interesting. President Wilson did\r\n    not mention the States’ rights formula. He said he was unable to\r\n    help the Suffrage Amendment in Congress because his Party was\r\n    opposed to it. It was the President’s theory, he explained, that a\r\n    Party leader should not go so far in advance of his adherents as to\r\n    withdraw himself from them, and make united action impossible upon\r\n    the other issues before the country.\r\n\r\n    The impression was strongly conveyed, however, that this opposition\r\n    from the President’s Party was not necessarily permanent. “In four\r\n    years, or in two years,” said Mr. Wilson, impressively but vaguely,\r\n    “the situation might be different. At present many members of the\r\n    Democratic Party are opposed to Woman Suffrage on account of the\r\n    negro question.” “But,” said one of his visitors, “if women were\r\n    given the vote throughout the United States the percentage of the\r\n    white vote to the negro vote would be increased.” “You have not\r\n    explained that to the men in Congress,” President Wilson said.\r\n\r\n    In answer to the statement that the Democratic Party would lose the\r\n    support of women in the West and therefore of western electoral\r\n    votes if they persisted in opposing women’s national\r\n    enfranchisement, President Wilson said he did not believe women\r\n    would vote in a national election on the Suffrage issue. “If they\r\n    did that,” said Mr. Wilson, with superb and quite unconscious\r\n    insolence, “they would not be as intelligent as I think they are.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe women came away from this meeting convinced that the President would\r\ndo nothing for the Federal Amendment.\r\n\r\nOn September 8, however, President Wilson spoke at Atlantic City before\r\na Convention of the National American Woman Suffrage Association. It was\r\nthe first time he had ever addressed a Suffrage meeting. That was, of\r\ncourse, in itself, significant. I quote the _Suffragist_:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I have found it a real privilege to be here tonight and to listen to\r\n    the address which you have heard. Though you may not all of you\r\n    believe it, I would a great deal rather hear some one else speak\r\n    than speak myself, but I should feel that I was omitting a duty if I\r\n    did not address you tonight and say some of the things that have\r\n    been in my thoughts as I realized the approach of this evening and\r\n    the duty that would fall upon me.\r\n\r\n    The astonishing thing about this movement which you represent is not\r\n    that it has grown so slowly, but that it has grown so rapidly. No\r\n    doubt for those who have been a long time in the struggle, like your\r\n    honored president, it seems a long and arduous path that has been\r\n    trodden, but when you think of the cumulating force of this movement\r\n    in recent decades, you must agree with me that it is one of the most\r\n    astonishing tides in modern history.\r\n\r\n    Two generations ago, no doubt, Madam President will agree with me in\r\n    saying it was a handful of women who were fighting this cause. Now\r\n    it is a great multitude of women who are fighting it. And there are\r\n    some interesting historical connections which I would like to\r\n    attempt to point out to you. One of the most striking facts about\r\n    the history of the United States is that at the outset it was a\r\n    lawyer’s history.\r\n\r\n    There was a time when nobody but a lawyer could know enough to run\r\n    the government of the United States, and a distinguished English\r\n    publicist once remarked, speaking of the complexity of the American\r\n    government, that it was no proof of the excellence of the American\r\n    Constitution that it had been successfully operated, because the\r\n    American could run any constitution. But there have been a great\r\n    many technical difficulties in running it.\r\n\r\n    And then something happened. A great question arose in this country\r\n    which, though complicated with legal elements, was at the bottom a\r\n    human question, and nothing but a question of humanity. That was the\r\n    slavery question, and is it not significant that it was then, and\r\n    then for the first time, that women became prominent in politics in\r\n    America? Not many women. Those prominent in that day are so few that\r\n    you can almost name them over in a brief catalogue, but\r\n    nevertheless, they then began to play a part in writing not only,\r\n    but in public speech, which was a very novel part for women to play\r\n    in America; and after the Civil War had settled some of what seemed\r\n    the most difficult legal questions of our system, the life of the\r\n    nation began not only to unfold but to accumulate.\r\n\r\n    Life in the United States was a comparatively simple matter at the\r\n    time of the Civil War. There was none of that underground struggle\r\n    which is now so manifest to those who look only a little way beneath\r\n    the surface. Stories such as Dr. Davis has told tonight were\r\n    uncommon in those simpler days.\r\n\r\n    The pressure of low wages, the agony of obscure and unremunerated\r\n    toil did not exist in America in anything the same proportions that\r\n    they exist now. And as our life has unfolded and accumulated, as the\r\n    contacts of it have become hot, as the populations have assembled in\r\n    the cities, and the cool spaces of the country have been supplanted\r\n    by the feverish urban areas, the whole nature of our political\r\n    questions has been altered. They have ceased to be legal questions.\r\n    They have more and more become social questions—questions with\r\n    regard to the relations of human beings to one another—not merely\r\n    their legal relations, but their moral and spiritual relations to\r\n    one another.\r\n\r\n    And this has been most characteristic of American life in the last\r\n    few decades, and as these questions have assumed greater and greater\r\n    prominence, the movement which this association represents has\r\n    gathered cumulative force. So that if anybody asks himself, “What\r\n    does this gathering force mean?” if he knows anything about the\r\n    history of the country, he knows that it means something that has\r\n    not only come to stay, but has come with conquering power.\r\n\r\n    I get a little impatient sometimes about the discussion of the\r\n    channels and methods by which it is to prevail. It is going to\r\n    prevail, and that is a very superficial and ignorant view of it\r\n    which attributes it to mere social unrest. It is not merely because\r\n    the women are discontented. It is because the women have seen\r\n    visions of duty, and that is something which we not only cannot\r\n    resist, but, if we be true Americans, we do not wish to resist.\r\n\r\n    So that what we have to realize in dealing with forces of this sort\r\n    is that we are dealing with the substance of life itself.\r\n\r\n    I have felt as I sat here tonight the wholesome contagion of the\r\n    occasion. Almost every other time that I ever visited Atlantic City\r\n    I came to fight somebody. I hardly know how to conduct myself when I\r\n    have not come to fight against anybody, but with somebody. I have\r\n    come to suggest, among other things, that when the forces of nature\r\n    are steadily working and the tide is rising to meet the moon, you\r\n    need not be afraid that it will not come to its flood.\r\n\r\n    We feel the tide: we rejoice in the strength of it and we shall not\r\n    quarrel in the long run as to the method of it. Because, when you\r\n    are working with masses of men and organized bodies of opinion, you\r\n    have got to carry the organized body along. The whole art and\r\n    practice of government consists, not in moving individuals, but in\r\n    moving masses. It is all very well to run ahead and beckon, but,\r\n    after all, you have got to wait for the mass to follow. I have not\r\n    come to ask you to be patient, because you have been, but I have\r\n    come to congratulate you that there was a force behind you that\r\n    will, beyond any peradventure, be triumphant and for which you can\r\n    afford a little while to wait.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis speech is, of course, often exquisitely phrased. However, it\r\npromised nothing. The Woman’s Party was not deceived by it.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is to be seen that President Wilson was moving—slowly, to be sure;\r\none cautious foot carefully planted before the other cautious foot\r\nmoved—in the right direction. He had progressed a measurable distance\r\nfrom the man who just after his inauguration admitted he had never\r\nconsidered the subject of Suffrage. However, he still held to his idea\r\nof the “State by State” progress for the enfranchisement of women. But\r\nhe was to change even in that, as will subsequently be seen.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  VII\r\n\r\n                   THE SECOND APPEAL TO WOMEN VOTERS\r\n\r\n\r\nON August 10, 11, and 12, of 1916, the newly-formed National Woman’s\r\nParty held a conference at the Hotel Antlers in Colorado Springs, to\r\nformulate a policy for the coming presidential campaign.\r\n\r\nIn Washington, Senators and Representatives read avidly the newspaper\r\naccounts of this convention.\r\n\r\nPolitically, it was a tremendously impressive gathering. Prominent women\r\ncame from all the Western States to decide how they should endeavor to\r\nmobilize the women’s votes. Greatly alarmed at this drifting away of\r\nmembers, the Democratic Party sent prominent Democratic women to plead\r\nwith them not to leave the Party and to represent to them that Peace was\r\nmore important than Suffrage. The Republicans sent important Republican\r\nwomen to plead with them to give their support to Hughes since he had\r\ncome out for the Federal Suffrage Amendment.\r\n\r\nFinally the Democratic leaders appealed to the President to counteract\r\nthe attacks being made on the Party, on the score of its Suffrage\r\nrecord. The President, thereupon, despatched to the Thomas Jefferson\r\nClub of Denver the following letter which was read at a banquet the last\r\nday of the Conference.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   THE WHITE HOUSE,\r\n\r\n              WASHINGTON, D. C., August 7, 1916.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR FRIENDS:\r\n\r\n    I wish I could meet you face to face and tell you in person how\r\n    deeply I appreciate the work your organization has done and proposes\r\n    to do for the cause of democracy and popular government.\r\n\r\n    I am told that yours was the first woman’s Democratic voters’\r\n    organization in America, and I am sure that as such it must have\r\n    been the instrument of impressing your convictions very deeply upon\r\n    the politics of your State.\r\n\r\n    One of the strongest forces behind the Equal Suffrage sentiment of\r\n    the country is the now demonstrated fact that in the Suffrage States\r\n    women interest themselves in public questions, study them\r\n    thoroughly, form their opinions and divide as men do concerning\r\n    them. It must in frankness be admitted that there are two sides to\r\n    almost every important public question, and even the best informed\r\n    persons are bound to differ in judgment concerning it. With each\r\n    difference in judgment, it is not only natural, but right and\r\n    patriotic, that the success of opposing convictions should be sought\r\n    through political alignment and the measuring of their strength at\r\n    the polls through political agencies. Men do this naturally, and so\r\n    do women; though it has required your practical demonstration of it\r\n    to convince those who doubted this. In proportion as the political\r\n    development of women continues along this line, the cause of Equal\r\n    Suffrage will be promoted.\r\n\r\n    Those who believe in Equal Suffrage are divided into those who\r\n    believe that each State should determine for itself when and in what\r\n    direction the Suffrage should be extended, and those who believe\r\n    that it should be immediately extended by the action of the national\r\n    government, by means of an amendment to the Federal Constitution.\r\n    Both the great political Parties of the nation have in their recent\r\n    platforms favored the extension of Suffrage to women through State\r\n    action, and I do not see how their candidates can consistently\r\n    disregard these official declarations. I shall endeavor to make the\r\n    declaration of my own Party in this matter effectual by every\r\n    influence that I can properly and legitimately exercise.\r\n\r\n    Woman’s part in the progress of the race, it goes without saying, is\r\n    quite as important as man’s. The old notion, too, that Suffrage and\r\n    service go hand in hand, is a sound one, and women may well appeal\r\n    to it, though it has long been invoked against them. The war in\r\n    Europe has forever set at rest the notion that nations depend in\r\n    time of stress wholly upon their men. The women of Europe are\r\n    bearing their full share of war’s awful burden in the daily\r\n    activities of the struggle, and more than their share as sufferers.\r\n    Their fathers and husbands and sons are fighting and dying in the\r\n    trenches; but they have taken up the work on the farms, at the mill,\r\n    and in the workshop and counting houses. They bury the dead, care\r\n    for the sick and wounded, console the fatherless, and sustain the\r\n    constant shock of war’s appalling sacrifices.\r\n\r\n    From these hideous calamities we in this favored land of ours have\r\n    thus far been shielded. I shall be profoundly thankful, if,\r\n    consistently with the honor and integrity of the nation, we may\r\n    maintain to the end our peaceful relations with the world.\r\n\r\n              Cordially and sincerely yours,\r\n\r\n                   WOODROW WILSON.\r\n\r\n    To the officers and members of the Jane Jefferson Club of Colorado.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Woman’s Party did not care for whom the women cast their protest\r\nvote—Republicans, Socialists, Prohibitionists—they cared only that women\r\nshould not vote for the Democrats. They knew if this protest vote was\r\nlarge enough, whoever was elected would realize that opposition to\r\nSuffrage was inexpedient.\r\n\r\nAt Colorado Springs the National Woman’s Party passed the following\r\nresolutions:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Resolved that the National Woman’s Party, so long as the opposition\r\n    of the Democratic Party continues, pledges itself to use its best\r\n    efforts in the twelve States where women vote for President to\r\n    defeat the Democratic candidate for President; and in the eleven\r\n    States where women vote for members of Congress to defeat the\r\n    candidates of the Democratic Party for Congress.\r\n\r\n\r\nImmediately the campaign began. It was the biggest campaign—the most\r\nimportant ever waged by the Woman’s Party. A stream of organizers\r\nstarted for the Western States to prepare the way for the speakers. How\r\nhard, and how long, and how intensively these girl organizers worked\r\nwill never be known because, in the very nature of things, there could\r\nbe no adequate record of their efforts. Then came a stream of speakers,\r\nrelay after relay—convinced, informed, experienced—and inspired. Among\r\nthem were Harriot Stanton Blatch, Sara Bard Field, Ida Finney Mackrille,\r\nMrs. William Kent, Mrs. H. O. Havemeyer, Helen Todd, Maud Younger, Rose\r\nWinslow, and Gail Laughlin. The brilliant, beautiful Inez Milholland\r\nBoissevain, doomed soon to die so untimely but so glorious a death, was\r\nappointed special flying envoy to make a twelve mile swing through the\r\ntwelve western Equal Suffrage States; to bring to the enfranchised women\r\nof the West an appeal for help from the disfranchised women of the East.\r\n\r\nThe campaign of 1916 was characterized by the swiftness of attack and\r\nefficiency of method which characterized the campaign of 1914, but it\r\nwas carried out on a much larger scale. In Washington, Headquarters\r\nboiled ... bubbled ... seethed....\r\n\r\nFrom Washington there sifted into the West tons of campaign literature:\r\nmiles of purple, white, and gold banners; acres of great\r\nacross-the-street streamers. In the West itself, Woman’s Party speakers\r\naddressed every kind of meeting known to our civilization: indoor\r\nmeetings; outdoor meetings; luncheons; banquets; labor unions; business\r\nmen’s organizations; in churches, factories, theatres; at mining camps,\r\ncounty fairs. They took advantage of impromptu meetings in the streets;\r\nsmall ready-made meetings at clubs; large advertised mass-meetings. And\r\nInez Milholland’s activities as a flying envoy—and in that, her last\r\nflight she did fly—were the climax of it all.\r\n\r\nThe slogan of the Wilson party was, “He kept us out of war.” The slogan\r\nof the Woman’s Party developed, “He kept us out of Suffrage.”\r\n\r\nThe Democrats, remembering the results of the campaign of 1914, were far\r\nfrom indulgent of this small army, the members of which were all\r\ngenerals.\r\n\r\nIn Denver, Elsie Hill the Woman’s Party organizer was arrested and\r\nhurried to the police station in a patrol wagon. The only charge against\r\nher was that she had distributed literature telling the Democratic\r\nrecord on Suffrage.\r\n\r\nIn Colorado Springs, the Federal Amendment banner was “arrested” and\r\nlocked up for the night in jail.\r\n\r\nIn Chicago, described by the _Chicago Tribune_ as the “pivotal point of\r\nthe 1916 election,” this hostility was much more violent. The day that\r\nWilson spoke there a hundred women, some of them carrying inscribed\r\nbanners, stationed themselves at the entrance to the auditorium where he\r\nwas to appear. They were attacked by groups of men, who tore their\r\nbanners out of their hands, and demolished them. Several women were\r\nthrown to the ground, and one, still clinging to the banner, was dragged\r\nacross the street.\r\n\r\nThis was followed by an attack upon Minnie E. Brooke, one of the Woman’s\r\nParty speakers. She was alone, walking quietly down Michigan Boulevard.\r\nShe had a small purple, white, and gold flag in her hand, and was\r\nwearing the regalia of the Woman’s Party. Suddenly two men darted up to\r\nher, and tried to tear her colors away. In the struggle she was thrown\r\ndown and would have fallen in front of an automobile had not a hotel\r\nemployee run to her assistance.\r\n\r\nHowever, in the out-of-way country places in the Western States, the\r\nWoman’s Party speakers were received with that hearty hospitality, that\r\ninstant and instinctive chivalry, which marks the West. In this\r\ncampaign, they made a point of appearing in the State and County Fairs\r\nwhich characterized the late summer and early fall months.\r\n\r\nOn Frontier Day, at the Douglas County Grange at Castle Rock, Colorado,\r\nElsie Hill spoke—to a grandstand crowded with people—between the end of\r\nthe relay race (in which the riders changed horses and saddles) and the\r\nbeginning of the steer-roping contest. On the stand were massed men,\r\nwomen, and children. Just over the fence crowded hundreds of cowboys and\r\nfarmers.\r\n\r\nStreet processions also characterized this campaign. At night in Salt\r\nLake City occurred an extraordinary parade—a river of yellow. The squad\r\nof mounted policemen who headed the procession wore the purple, white,\r\nand gold regalia of the Woman’s Party. Marching women carried lighted\r\nyellow Japanese lanterns. The people who filled the automobiles carried\r\nyellow lanterns. The huge Amendment banner was yellow. Yellow banners\r\nwere strung across the streets.\r\n\r\nBillboards and posters appeared everywhere which adjured voters not to\r\nsupport Wilson or any Democratic candidates for Congress. In Tucson and\r\nPrescott, Arizona, these great banners were surreptitiously cut down. In\r\nCalifornia, the Democrats placed counter placards beside these\r\ndisturbing posters. In San Francisco, armed patrols guarded the two\r\nconflicting posters in one hotel lobby.\r\n\r\nThe Woman’s Party speakers took advantage of all kinds of situations. In\r\none town, Maud Younger found that a circus had arrived just ahead of\r\nher. There was no adequate hall for a meeting; and so the circus men\r\noffered her their tent; they even megaphoned her meeting for her. In\r\nanother town, a County Fair was being held. Maud Younger appealed to the\r\nclowns to give her a chance to speak, and they let her have their\r\nplatform and the spot-light while they were changing costumes. In San\r\nFrancisco, Hazel Hunkins scattered thousands of leaflets from an\r\naeroplane flying over the city. Red Lodge, Montana, sent to the train,\r\nwhich brought Abby Scott Baker to them, a delegation of members of the\r\nGrand Army of the Republic, the leader bearing a large American flag.\r\nThey conducted her in state through the town to the hall where she was\r\nto speak.\r\n\r\nPerhaps no campaign was more interesting than that of Rose Winslow in\r\nArizona. Vivian Pierce, whose experienced newspaper hand on the\r\n_Suffragist_ helped to make that paper the success it so swiftly became,\r\nthus describes her work:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Rose Winslow represented the workers. She spoke for the exploited\r\n    women in Eastern industry. In her own person to her audiences she\r\n    typified her story of those imprisoned in factories and slums,\r\n    unable to fight their own battles. Her words had the authenticity of\r\n    an inspired young evangelist. She herself had come up out of that\r\n    darkness; and the men of the mines and lumber camps, the women of\r\n    the remote Arizona towns, listened to her with tears pouring down\r\n    their faces. One does not see Eastern audiences so moved. At Winslow\r\n    ... this girl, pleading for working women, the most exploited class\r\n    in industry, appealed to the men of the great Santa Fé railroad\r\n    shops that animate the life of that remote region on the edge of the\r\n    “Painted Desert.” Rose Winslow had been warned that if she spoke at\r\n    this town, she would be “mobbed” by the Wilson Democrats. After her\r\n    impassioned story, told one noon hour, the men of the shops crowded\r\n    around this young woman from the East, “one of our own people,” as\r\n    one man said, and asked her what they could do for the women of the\r\n    East....\r\n\r\n    In the remote copper camps around Jerome and Bisbee, the story of\r\n    the industrial workers who have merely asked for a chance to help\r\n    themselves, made a deep impression on the foreign-born voters of\r\n    this section. There were Poles, Finns, and Lithuanians in the great\r\n    audience held in that copper town that is the working-man’s annex to\r\n    Bisbee. That audience both laughed and cried with Rose Winslow, and\r\n    then crowded around to greet her in her own language.\r\n\r\n    From the vividly colored fastness of the miners’ villages in this\r\n    wild mountain region, to border towns like Nogales, though but a\r\n    short step geographically, the temper and character of the cities\r\n    change.... In places like Nogales, the soldiers who could not go\r\n    home to vote turned the Woman’s Party meetings into near-riots, so\r\n    anxious were these victims of a peace administration to hear what\r\n    the ladies had to say about Wilson. The soldiers registered their\r\n    approval by helping take up collections, though even the provost\r\n    guard could not remove them to give space to citizens able to\r\n    register their protests.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn event equally picturesque marked the closing of the campaign on the\r\nnight of Sunday, November 5, on the platform of the Blackstone Theatre,\r\nChicago. There, Harriot Stanton Blatch, acting as the spokesman of the\r\ndisfranchised women of the East, called up by long-distance telephone a\r\nseries of mass-meetings, one in each of the twelve Suffrage States and\r\nrepeated their message—a final appeal to the women voters of the West to\r\ncast their ballots on the following Tuesday against President Wilson.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe result of the election is summed up in the _Suffragist_ of November\r\n11:\r\n\r\n\r\n    In Illinois, the only State where the vote of women is counted\r\n    separately, over seventy thousand more women voted against Mr.\r\n    Wilson than for him....\r\n\r\n    The reports indicate that the Woman’s Party campaign was as\r\n    successful in holding the woman’s vote in line in the other eleven\r\n    States as in Illinois. While ten of these States went for Wilson,\r\n    they did not do so, as has been claimed, by the woman’s vote. Mr.\r\n    Wilson received in these States almost the solid Labor vote, the\r\n    Progressive, and the farmer’s vote. The popular majority which Mr.\r\n    Wilson received in the twelve Suffrage States amounted only to\r\n    twenty-two thousand one hundred seventy-one out of a popular vote,\r\n    according to the latest returns, of more than four million, eight\r\n    hundred and ten thousand in the same States. This does not include\r\n    the Socialist and Prohibition vote, which was very heavy in some of\r\n    the Western States....\r\n\r\n    We were not concerned with the result of the election. Ours was a\r\n    campaign in which it made no difference who was elected. We did not\r\n    endorse any candidate. We did not care who won. We were not\r\n    pro-Republican, pro-Socialist, pro-Prohibition—we were simply\r\n    pro-woman. We did not endeavor to affect the result in the\r\n    non-Suffrage States. What we did try to do was to organize a protest\r\n    vote by women against Mr. Wilson’s attitude towards Suffrage. This\r\n    we did. Every Democrat who campaigned in the West knows this. The\r\n    Democratic campaign in the West soon consisted almost entirely of an\r\n    attempt to combat the Woman’s Party attack.\r\n\r\n\r\nTribute to the strength of the Woman’s Party campaign is contained in\r\nthe remark of a woman who had in charge the campaign of the Democratic\r\nwomen voters. Out of six leaflets which her organization got out, five\r\nwere on the subject of Suffrage. A reporter remonstrated with her in\r\nregard to Suffrage not being an issue in the West. She agreed with him,\r\nbut, she added, “We have to combat the Woman’s Party.”\r\n\r\nThe whole Western campaign of the Republicans was conducted as if they\r\nwere assured of victory. In many cases the organizers of the Woman’s\r\nParty told the Republicans in the East that they were going to lose in\r\ncertain districts. “Nonsense,” laughed the Republicans, “we are sure to\r\nwin there, absolutely sure.” Alice Paul in Chicago received reports from\r\ncampaigners through the West and all predicted Democratic victory. She\r\nwent to Republican Headquarters with these reports, but she could not\r\nconvince the Republicans of the truth of them.\r\n\r\nSenator Curtis, Secretary of the Republican Senatorial Committee, said\r\nhe got more information as to the situation in the West from the Woman’s\r\nParty than he got from any other source.\r\n\r\nIt became apparent soon that Wilson was going to win. It was then that\r\nadvisors came to Alice Paul and said, “Withdraw your speakers from the\r\ncampaign, so that you will not have the humiliation of defeat before the\r\ncountry.”\r\n\r\nAnd it was then that Alice Paul answered, “_No. If we withdraw our\r\nspeakers from the campaign, we withdraw the issue from the campaign. We\r\nmust make this such an important thing in national elections that the\r\nDemocrats will not want to meet it again._”\r\n\r\nCommenting on this campaign, Alice Paul said the Democrats made a strong\r\nappeal to the women voters but for the Republicans the women did not\r\nexist, and in fact the chief recognition that the Republicans made of\r\nthe women in the West was to send there the Hughes so-called “Golden\r\nSpecial,” which, on leaving Chicago, announced that it was _not_ a\r\n“Suffrage Special.”\r\n\r\nAfter the campaign was over, Vance McCormick, Chairman of the Democratic\r\nParty, was talking with a member of his committee. He said, in effect:\r\n“Before the election of 1918, we must patch up our weak places. Our\r\nweakest spot is the Suffrage situation. We must get rid of the Suffrage\r\nAmendment before 1918 if we want to control the next Congress.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Sixty-fourth Congress met for its second and last session on\r\nDecember 4, 1916. President Wilson delivered a message which made no\r\nreference to the subject of Woman Suffrage. The Congressional Union,\r\nalways having advance information, knew this beforehand. And so on that\r\noccasion, by a bit of direct action, they brought Suffrage vividly to\r\nthe attention of President Wilson, Congress, and the whole country. This\r\nwas the only action of the Woman’s Party which Alice Paul did not give\r\nout beforehand to the press.\r\n\r\nEarly that morning, before the outer doors were opened, five women of\r\nthe Congressional Union appeared before the Capitol. After a long wait\r\nthe doors were opened, and—the first of a big crowd—they placed\r\nthemselves in the front row of the gallery just to the left of the big\r\nclock. They faced the Speaker’s desk, from which the President would\r\nread his message. These five women were: Mrs. John Rogers, Jr.; Mrs.\r\nHarry Lowenburg; Dr. Caroline Spencer; Florence Bayard Hilles; Mabel\r\nVernon. In a casual manner, other members of the Union seated themselves\r\nbehind them and on the gallery steps beside them: Lucy Burns; Elizabeth\r\nPapandre; Mildred Gilbert; Mrs. William L. Colt; Mrs. Townsend Scott.\r\n\r\nMabel Vernon sat in the middle of the five women in the front row.\r\nPinned to her skirt, under the enveloping cape which she wore, was a big\r\nbanner of yellow sateen. After the five women had settled themselves,\r\nMabel Vernon unpinned the banner and dropped it, all ready for\r\nunrolling, on the floor. At the top of the banner were five long\r\ntapes—too long—Mabel Vernon now regretfully declares. At the\r\npsychological moment, which had been picked beforehand, in President\r\nWilson’s speech—he was recommending a greater freedom for the Porto\r\nRican men—Mabel Vernon whispered the series of signals which had\r\npreviously been decided on. Immediately—working like a beautifully\r\nco-ordinated machine—the five women stooped, lifted the banner, and,\r\nholding it tightly by the tapes, dropped it over the balcony edge. It\r\nunrolled with a smart snap and displayed these words:\r\n\r\n          MR. PRESIDENT, WHAT WILL YOU DO FOR WOMAN SUFFRAGE?\r\n\r\nThen the women sat perfectly still, in the words of the _Washington\r\nPost_ “five demure and unruffled women ... with the cords supporting the\r\nfluttering thing clenched in their hands.”\r\n\r\nThe effect was instantaneous. The President looked up, hesitated a\r\nmoment, then went on reading. All the Congressmen turned. The Speaker\r\nsat motionless. A buzz ran wildly across the floor. Policemen and guards\r\nheaded upstairs to the gallery where the women were seated; but their\r\nprogress was inevitably slow as the steps were tightly packed with\r\nmembers of the Congressional Union. In the meantime, one of the pages,\r\nleaping upward, caught the banner and tore it away from the cords in the\r\nwomen’s hands. “If it hadn’t been for those long tapes,” Mabel Vernon\r\nsays, “they never could have got it until the President finished his\r\nspeech.”\r\n\r\nThe episode took up less than five minutes’ time. Until the President\r\nfinished his message, it seemed to be completely forgotten. But the\r\ninstant the President with his escort disappeared through the door,\r\nevery Congressman was on his feet staring up at the gallery.\r\n\r\nThe Woman’s Party publicity accounts of this episode—multigraphed the\r\nnight before—were in the hands of the men in the Press Gallery the\r\ninstant after it happened. This is a sample of the perfect organization\r\nand execution of the Woman’s Party plans.\r\n\r\nOf course, this incident was a front page story in every newspaper in\r\nthe United States that night despoiling the President of his headlines.\r\nIt is now one of the legends in Washington that in the midst of the\r\ndinner given to the President by the Gridiron Club shortly after, the\r\nidentical banner was unfurled before his eyes.\r\n\r\nThe following week, at the first meeting of the Judiciary Committee\r\nsince the Presidential Campaign, the report of the Federal Suffrage\r\nAmendment was made without recommendation to the House of\r\nRepresentatives.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  VIII\r\n\r\n                           HAIL AND FAREWELL\r\n\r\n                     TO INEZ MILHOLLAND BOISSEVAIN\r\n\r\n               “For Lycidas is dead, dead ere his prime;\r\n               Young Lycidas, and hath not left his peer.”\r\n                                            —MILTON.\r\n\r\n           Inez, vibrant, courageous, symbolic,\r\n           How can death claim you?\r\n           Many he leads down the long halls of silence\r\n           Burdened with years,\r\n           Those who have known sorrow\r\n           And are weary with forgetting,\r\n           The young who have tasted only gladness\r\n           And who go with wistful eyes,\r\n           Never to see the sharp breaking of illusion.\r\n           For these—\r\n           We who remain and are lonely\r\n           Find consolation, saying\r\n           “They have won the white vistas of quietness.”\r\n\r\n           But for you—\r\n           The words of my grief will not form\r\n           In a pattern of resignation.\r\n           The syllables of rebellion\r\n           Are quivering upon my lips!\r\n           You belonged to life—\r\n           To the struggling actuality of earth;\r\n           You were our Hortensia and flung\r\n           Her challenge to the world—\r\n           Our world still strangely Roman—\r\n           “Does justice scorn a woman?”\r\n\r\n           Oh!

She died that other women might be free.\r\n\r\nIn the recent campaign, she had spoken in Wyoming, Idaho, Oregon,\r\nWashington, Montana, Utah, Nevada, and California. In her memorial\r\naddress, Maud Younger said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The trip was fraught with hardship. Speaking day and night, she\r\n    would take a train at two in the morning, to arrive at eight; and\r\n    then a train at midnight, to arrive at five in the morning. She\r\n    would come away from audiences and droop as a flower. The hours\r\n    between were hours of exhaustion and suffering. She would ride in\r\n    the trains gazing from the windows, listless, almost lifeless, until\r\n    one spoke; then again the sweet smile, the sudden interest, the\r\n    quick sympathy. The courage of her was marvelous.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INEZ MILHOLLAND.\r\nIn the Washington Parade, March 3, 1913.\r\nPhoto Copr. Harris and Ewing.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAt a great mass-meeting at Los Angeles, in October, she was saying—in\r\nanswer to the President’s words, “The tide is rising to meet the moon;\r\nyou will not have long to wait,”—“How long must women wait for liberty?”\r\nOn the word _liberty_, she fell fainting to the floor. Within a month,\r\nshe was dead.\r\n\r\nThat Christmas Day, Statuary Hall in the Capitol of the United States\r\nwas transformed. The air was full of the smells of the forest. Greens\r\nmade a background—partially concealing the semi-circle of statues—at the\r\nrear; laurel and cedar banked the dais in front; somber velvet curtains\r\nfell about its sides. Every one of the chairs which filled the big\r\ncentral space supported a flag of purple, white, and gold. Between the\r\npillars of the balcony hung a continuous frieze; pennants of purple,\r\nwhite, and gold—the tri-color of these feminist crusaders.\r\n\r\nThe audience assembled in the solemn quiet proper to such an occasion,\r\nnoiselessly took their seats in the semi-circle below and the gallery\r\nabove. The organ played _Ave Maria_. Then again, a solemn silence fell.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the stillness was invaded by a sound—music, very faint and\r\nfar-away. It grew louder and louder. It was the sound of singing. It\r\ncame nearer and nearer. It was the voices of boys. Presently the\r\nbeginning of a long line of boy choristers, who had wound through the\r\nmarble hallway, appeared in the doorway. They marched into the hall\r\nchanting:\r\n\r\n                     “Forward, out of error,\r\n                      Leave behind the night,\r\n                      Forward through the darkness,\r\n                      Forward into light.”\r\n\r\nBehind came Mary Morgan in white, carrying a golden banner with the\r\nabove words inscribed on it. This was a duplicate of the banner that\r\nInez Milholland bore in the first Suffrage parade in New York. Behind\r\nthe golden banner came a great procession of young women wearing\r\nstraight surplices; the first division in purple, the next in white, the\r\nlast in gold, carrying high standards which bore the tri-color. Before\r\neach division came another young girl in white, carrying a golden\r\nbanner—lettered.\r\n\r\nOne banner said:\r\n\r\n GREATER LOVE HATH NO MAN THAN THIS THAT HELAY DOWN HIS LIFE FOR A FRIEND\r\n\r\nAnother banner said:\r\n\r\n     WITHOUT EXTINCTION IS LIBERTY, WITHOUT RETROGRADE IS EQUALITY\r\n\r\nThe last banner said:\r\n\r\n        AS HE DIED TO MAKE MEN HOLY LET US DIE TO MAKE MEN FREE\r\n\r\nThese white-clad girls stood in groups on both sides of the\r\nlaurel-covered dais against the shadowy background of the curtains. The\r\nstandard-bearers in the purple, the white, the gold, formed a\r\nsemi-circle of brilliant color which lined the hall and merged with the\r\npurple, white, and gold frieze above them. They stood during the\r\nservice, their tri-colored banners at rest.\r\n\r\nThere followed music. The choristers sang: _Forward Be Our Watchword_.\r\nThe Mendelssohn Quartet sang: _Love Divine_ and _Thou Whose Almighty\r\nWord_. Elizabeth Howry sang first _All Through the Night_ and,\r\nimmediately after, Henchel’s ringing triumphant _Morning Song_. It is an\r\nacoustic effect of Statuary Hall that the music seems to come from\r\nabove. That effect added immeasurably to the solemnity of this occasion.\r\n\r\nTribute speeches followed, Anne Martin introducing the speakers. Mrs.\r\nWilliam Kent read two resolutions: one prepared under the direction of\r\nZona Gale, the other by Florence Brewer Boeckel. Maud Younger delivered\r\na beautiful memorial address.\r\n\r\n\r\n    “And so ever through the West, she went,” Miss Younger said in part,\r\n    “through the West that drew her, the West that loved her, until she\r\n    came to the end of the West. There where the sun goes down in glory\r\n    in the vast Pacific, her life went out in glory in the shining cause\r\n    of freedom.... They will tell of her in the West, tell of the vision\r\n    of loveliness as she flashed through her last burning mission,\r\n    flashed through to her death, a falling star in the western\r\n    heavens.... With new devotion we go forth, inspired by her sacrifice\r\n    to the end that this sacrifice be not in vain, but that dying she\r\n    shall bring to pass that which living she could not achieve, full\r\n    freedom for women, full democracy for the nation....”\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the end the quartet sang, _Before the Heavens Were Spread Abroad_.\r\nThen the procession re-formed, and marched out again as it had come, a\r\nslow-moving band of color which gradually disappeared; a river of music\r\nwhich gradually died to a thread, to a sigh ... to nothing.... As before\r\nthe white-surpliced choristers headed the procession, chanting the\r\nrecessional, _For All the Saints_. Their banners lowered, the girl\r\nstandard-bearers—first those in floating gold, then those in drifting\r\nwhite, then those in heavy purple—followed. From the far-away reaches of\r\nthe winding marble halls sounded the boyish voices. Faintly came:\r\n\r\n\r\n    O, may Thy Soldiers, faithful, true and bold, Fight as the Saints\r\n    who nobly fought of old, And win with them the victor’s crown of\r\n    gold. Alleluia!\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd fainter still:\r\n\r\n\r\n    But, lo, there breaks a yet more glorious day, The Saints triumphant\r\n    rise in bright array.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe voices lost themselves in the distance, merged with silence. The\r\naudience still sat moveless, spellbound by all this beauty and grief.\r\nSuddenly the _Marseillaise_ burst from the organ like a call to the new\r\nbattle. Instantly, it was echoed by the strings.\r\n\r\nOn January 9, the President received a deputation of three hundred\r\nwomen. This deputation brought to him the resolutions passed at\r\nmemorials held in commemoration of Inez Milholland from California to\r\nNew York.\r\n\r\nSara Bard Field said in part:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Since that day (a year ago) when we came to you, Mr. President, one\r\n    of our most beautiful and beloved comrades, Inez Milholland, has\r\n    paid the price of her life for a cause. The untimely death of a\r\n    young woman like this—a woman for whom the world has such bitter\r\n    need—has focussed the attention of men and women of this nation on\r\n    the fearful waste of women which this fight for the ballot is\r\n    entailing. The same maternal instinct for the preservation of\r\n    life—whether it be the physical life of a child, or the spiritual\r\n    life of a cause—is sending women into this battle for liberty with\r\n    an urge that gives them no rest night or day. Every advance of\r\n    liberty has demanded its quota of human sacrifice, and, if I had\r\n    time, I could show you that we have paid in a measure that is\r\n    running over. In the light of Inez Milholland’s death, as we look\r\n    over the long backward trail through which we have sought our\r\n    political liberty, we are asking, how long, how long, must this\r\n    struggle go on?\r\n\r\n    Mr. President, to the nation more than to women themselves is this\r\n    waste of maternal force significant. In industry, such a waste of\r\n    money and strength would not be permitted. The modern trend is all\r\n    towards efficiency. Why is such waste permitted in the making of a\r\n    nation?\r\n\r\n    Sometimes I think it must be very hard to be a President, in respect\r\n    to his contacts with people, as well as in the grave business he\r\n    must perform. The exclusiveness necessary to a great dignitary holds\r\n    him away from the democracy of communion necessary to full\r\n    understanding of what the people are really thinking and desiring. I\r\n    feel that this deputation today fails in its mission if, because of\r\n    the dignity of your office and the formality of such an occasion, we\r\n    fail to bring to you the throb of woman’s desire for freedom and her\r\n    eagerness to ally herself with all those activities to which you\r\n    yourself have dedicated your life. When once the ballot is in her\r\n    hand, those tasks which this nation has set itself to do are her\r\n    tasks as well as man’s. We women who are here today are close to\r\n    this desire of woman. We cannot believe that you are our enemy, or\r\n    are indifferent to the fundamental righteousness of our demand.\r\n\r\n    We have come here to you in your powerful office as our helper. We\r\n    have come in the name of justice, in the name of democracy, in the\r\n    name of all women who have fought and died for this cause, and in a\r\n    peculiar way, with our hearts bowed in sorrow, in the name of this\r\n    gallant girl who died with the word “Liberty” on her lips. We have\r\n    come asking you this day to speak some favorable word to us, that we\r\n    may know that you will use your good and great office to end this\r\n    wasteful struggle of women.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOY YOUNG AT THE INEZ MILHOLLAND MEMORIAL SERVICE.] The\r\nPresident replied:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Ladies, I had not been apprised that you were coming here to make\r\n    any representation that would issue an appeal to me. I had been told\r\n    that you were coming to present memorial resolutions with regard to\r\n    the very remarkable woman whom your cause has lost. I therefore am\r\n    not prepared to say anything further than I have said on previous\r\n    occasions of this sort.\r\n\r\n    I do not need to tell you where my own convictions and my own\r\n    personal purpose lie, and I need not tell you by what\r\n    circumscriptions I am bound as leader of a Party. As the leader of a\r\n    Party, my commands come from that Party, and not from private\r\n    personal convictions.\r\n\r\n    My personal action as a citizen, of course, comes from no source,\r\n    but my own conviction, and there my position has been so frequently\r\n    defined, and I hope so candidly defined, and it is so impossible for\r\n    me until the orders of my Party are changed, to do anything other\r\n    than I am doing as a Party leader that I think nothing more is\r\n    necessary to be said.\r\n\r\n    I do want to say this: I do not see how anybody can fail to observe\r\n    from the utterance of the last campaign that the Democratic Party is\r\n    more inclined than the opposition Party to assist in this great\r\n    cause, and it has been a matter of surprise to me, and a matter of\r\n    very great regret, that so many of those who are heart and soul for\r\n    this cause seem so greatly to misunderstand and misinterpret the\r\n    attitudes of Parties. In this country, as in every other\r\n    self-governing country, it is really through the instrumentality of\r\n    Parties that things can be accomplished. They are not accomplished\r\n    by the individual voice, but by concentrated action, and that action\r\n    must come only so fast as you can concert it. I have done my best,\r\n    and shall continue to do my best to concert it in the interest of a\r\n    cause in which I personally believe.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Maud Younger’s delightful _Revelations of a Woman Lobbyist_, in\r\n_McCall’s Magazine_, she thus describes that scene:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The doors opened, and, surrounded by Secret Service men, President\r\n    Wilson entered. He came quickly forward, smiling as he shook my\r\n    hand. Contrary to the general impression, President Wilson has a\r\n    very human, sympathetic personality. He is not the aloof, academic\r\n    type one expects of a man who, avoiding people, gets much of his\r\n    knowledge from books and reports. Though he appears to the general\r\n    public as in a mist on a mountain top, like the gods of old, he is\r\n    really a man of decided emotional reactions.\r\n\r\n    I answered his greeting briefly, giving him the resolutions I held,\r\n    and presented Mrs. John Winters Brannan, who handed him the New York\r\n    memorial without speaking at all. We were saving time for his\r\n    declaration. Then came Sara—small, delicate Sara Bard Field, a woman\r\n    of rare spirituality and humor—whom we had chosen to speak for us.\r\n\r\n    She began to talk very nobly and beautifully, while the President\r\n    listened cordially. But suddenly a cold wave passed over him. Sara\r\n    had quoted Mr. Hughes. At that name, the President’s manner chilled.\r\n    The look in his eyes became so cold that, as Sara says, the words\r\n    almost froze on her lips. She finished in an icy stillness, and\r\n    after a moment the President spoke.\r\n\r\n    Instead of the assurances we had expected, we heard words to the\r\n    effect that he could not dictate to his Party. We must first concert\r\n    public opinion. It was his last gleam, for, looking about him and\r\n    seeing amazement, disappointment, indignation, he grew still colder.\r\n    With a last defiant glance at us all he abruptly left the room.\r\n    Secret Service men, newspaper men, and secretaries followed him.\r\n    Where the President of the United States had been was now a closed\r\n    door.\r\n\r\n    Stunned, talking in low, indignant tones, we moved slowly out of the\r\n    East Room and returned to our Headquarters. There we discussed the\r\n    situation. We saw that the President would do nothing for some time,\r\n    perhaps not until the eve of the Presidential election in 1920. He\r\n    said we must concert public opinion. But how? For half a century\r\n    women had been walking the hard way of the lobbyist. We had had\r\n    speeches, meetings, parades, campaigns, organization. What new\r\n    method could we devise?\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               PART THREE\r\n                                  1917\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   I\r\n\r\n                        THE PERPETUAL DELEGATION\r\n\r\n                           ON THE PICKET LINE\r\n\r\n                The avenue is misty gray,\r\n                And here beside the guarded gate\r\n                We hold our golden blowing flags\r\n                And wait.\r\n\r\n                The people pass in friendly wise;\r\n                They smile their greetings where we stand\r\n                And turn aside to recognize\r\n                The just demand.\r\n\r\n                Often the gates are swung aside:\r\n                The man whose power could free us now\r\n                Looks from his car to read our plea—\r\n                And bow.\r\n\r\n                Sometimes the little children laugh;\r\n                The careless folk toss careless words,\r\n                And scoff and turn away, and yet\r\n                The people pass the whole long day\r\n                Those golden flags against the gray\r\n                And can’t forget.\r\n                                           BEULAH AMIDON.\r\n                         _The Suffragist_, March 3, 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      _1. The Peaceful Picketing_\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore we examine the consideration which actuated the National Woman’s\r\nParty in waging the picket campaign of 1917, let us see where President\r\nWilson stood at the beginning of the war; let us briefly recapitulate\r\nthe steps which brought him there.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that, shortly after the President took his seat in\r\nMarch, 1913, he told a deputation from the Congressional Committee that\r\nSuffrage was a question to which he had given no thought and on which he\r\nhad no opinion. During the year, no longer stating that he knew nothing\r\nabout Suffrage, he gave as a reason for inaction that the Congressional\r\nprogram was too crowded to consider it. By the end of the year, he had\r\nreached the point where he stated that he could take no action on the\r\nSuffrage Amendment until commanded by his Party.\r\n\r\nIn 1914, he continued to state that he was prohibited from acting\r\nbecause of being bound by his Party until June, when he seized on the\r\nexcuse of States Rights further to explain his inaction. In the autumn\r\nof 1915 he first came out personally for Suffrage by voting for it in\r\nNew Jersey but still refused to support it in Congress. His next step\r\nforward came in June, 1916, when he caused the _principle_ of Suffrage\r\nto be recognized in the Party platform, though as yet neither he nor the\r\nParty had endorsed the Federal Amendment. In September of that same\r\nyear—after the Woman’s Party had begun its active campaign in the\r\nSuffrage States—the President took another step and addressed a Suffrage\r\nConvention of the National American Woman’s Suffrage Association. But as\r\nyet he was not committed to the Federal Amendment, had not begun to\r\nexert pressure on Congress.\r\n\r\nThe situation of the President and the Woman’s Party at this juncture\r\nmay be summed up in this way. Wilson, himself, was beginning to realize\r\nthat the Suffrage Amendment must ultimately pass. But he had just been\r\nre-elected. He was safe for four years; he could take his time about it.\r\nThe Woman’s Party on the other hand, realized that the President being\r\nsafe for four years, no political pressure could be exerted upon him.\r\nThey realized that they must devise other methods to keep Suffrage, as a\r\nmeasure demanding immediate enactment, before him.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, a feeling of acute discontent was growing in the women\r\nof the United States. The older women—and they were the third generation\r\nto demand the vote—were beginning to ask how long this period of\r\nentreaty must be protracted. The younger women—the fourth generation to\r\ndemand the vote—were becoming impatient with the out-worn methods of\r\ntheir predecessors. Moreover, when the disfranchised women of the East\r\nvisited the enfranchised States of the West, their eyes were opened in a\r\npractical way to the extraordinary injustice of their own\r\ndisfranchisement. Equally, the enfranchised women of the West, moving to\r\nEastern States, resented their loss of this political weapon. On many\r\nwomen in America the militant movement of England had produced a\r\nprofound impression.\r\n\r\nA new note had crept into the speeches made by the members of the\r\nWoman’s Party—the note of this impatience and resentment. It will be\r\nremembered that Mrs. Kent told the President that the women voters of\r\nthe West were accustomed to being listened to with attention by\r\npoliticians, and that they resented the effort to make it seem that they\r\nwere merely trying to bother a very busy official. Mrs. Blatch had told\r\nhim that the time had gone by when she would stand on street corners and\r\nask the vote from every Tom, Dick, and Harry; that she was determined to\r\nappeal instead to the men who spoke her own language and who had in\r\ncharge the affairs of the government.\r\n\r\nDoris Stevens, in an interview in the _Omaha Daily News_ for June 29,\r\n1919, voices perfectly what her generation was feeling.\r\n\r\n\r\n    A successful young Harvard engineer said to me the other day, “I\r\n    don’t believe you realize how much men objected to your picketing\r\n    the White House. Now I know what I’m talking about. I’ve talked with\r\n    men in all walks of life, and I tell you they didn’t approve of what\r\n    you women did.”\r\n\r\n    This last with warmer emphasis and a scowl of the brow. “I don’t\r\n    suppose you were in a position to know how violently men felt about\r\n    it.”\r\n\r\n    I listened patiently and courteously. Should I disillusion him? I\r\n    thought it was the honest thing to do. “Why, of course men didn’t\r\n    like it. Do you think we imagined they would? We knew they would\r\n    disapprove. When _did men ever_ applaud women fighting for their own\r\n    liberty? We are approved only when we fight for yours!”\r\n\r\n    “You don’t mean to say you planned to do something knowing men would\r\n    not approve?”\r\n\r\n    I simply had to tell him, “Why, certainly! We’re just beginning to\r\n    get confidence in ourselves. At last we’ve learned to make and stand\r\n    by our own judgments.”\r\n\r\n    “But going to jail. That was pretty shocking.”\r\n\r\n    “Yes, indeed it was. It not only shocked us that a government would\r\n    be alarmed enough to do such a thing, but what was more to the\r\n    point, it shocked the entire country into doing something quickly\r\n    about Woman Suffrage.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt will be seen by the foregoing pages of this book that Suffragists had\r\nexhausted every form of Suffrage agitation known to the United States.\r\nIn particular, they had sent to the President every kind of deputation\r\nthat could possibly move him.\r\n\r\nThey decided to send him a perpetual deputation.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAlice Paul, in explanation of her strategy in this matter, uses one of\r\nthe vivid figures that are so typical of her: “If a creditor stands\r\nbefore a man’s house all day long, demanding payment of his bill, the\r\nman must either remove the creditor or pay the bill.”\r\n\r\nAt first, the President tried to remove the creditor. Later he paid the\r\nbill.\r\n\r\nAt ten o’clock on January 10, 1917, the day after the deputation to the\r\nPresident, twelve women emerged from Headquarters and marched across\r\nLafayette Square to the White House. Four of them bore lettered banners,\r\nand eight of them carried purple, white, and gold banners of the Woman’s\r\nParty. They marched slowly—a banner’s length apart. Six of them took up\r\ntheir stand at the East gate, and six of them at the West gate. At each\r\ngate—standing between pairs of women holding on high purple, white, and\r\ngold colors—two women held lettered banners. One read:\r\n\r\n\r\n    MR. PRESIDENT WHAT WILL YOU DO FOR WOMAN SUFFRAGE?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe other read:\r\n\r\n\r\n    HOW LONG MUST WOMEN WAIT FOR LIBERTY?\r\n\r\n\r\nThese were the first women to picket the White House.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe first picket line appeared on January 10, 1917; the last, over a\r\nyear and a half later. Between those dates, except when Congress was not\r\nin session, more than a thousand women held lettered banners,\r\naccompanied by the purple, white, and gold tri-colors, at the White\r\nHouse gates, or in front of the Capitol. They picketed every day of the\r\nweek, except Sunday; in all kinds of weather, in rain and in sleet, in\r\nhail, and in snow. All varieties of women picketed: all races and\r\nreligions; all cliques and classes; all professions and parties.\r\nWashington became accustomed to the dignified picture—the pickets moving\r\nwith a solemn silence, always in a line that followed a crack in the\r\npavement; always a banner’s length apart; taking their stand with a\r\nprecision almost military; maintaining it with a movelessness almost\r\nstatuesque. Washington became accustomed also to the rainbow splash at\r\nthe White House gates—“like trumpet calls,” somebody described the\r\nbanners. Artists often spoke of the beauty of their massed color. In the\r\ndaytime, those banners gilded by the sunlight were doubly brilliant, but\r\nat twilight the effect was transcendent. Everywhere the big, white\r\nlights—set in the parks on such low standards that they seemed strange,\r\nluminous blossoms, springing from the masses of emerald green\r\nshrubbery—filled the dusk with bluish-white splendor, and, made doubly\r\ncolorful by this light, the long purple, white, and gold ribbon stood\r\nout against a background beautiful and appropriate; a mosaic on the gray\r\nof the White House pavement; the pen-and-ink blackness of the White\r\nHouse iron work; the bare, brown crisscross of the White House trees,\r\nand the chaste colonial simplicity of the White House itself.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWith her abiding instinct for pageantry and for telling picturesqueness\r\nof demonstration, Alice Paul soon punctuated the monotony of the\r\npicketing by special events. Various States celebrated State days on the\r\npicket line. Maryland was the first of these, and the long line of\r\nMaryland women bearing great banners, extended along Pennsylvania Avenue\r\nthe entire distance from the East gate to the West gate. Pennsylvania\r\nDay, New York Day, Virginia Day, New Jersey Day, followed. The Monday of\r\nevery week was set aside finally for District of Columbia Day.\r\n\r\nThe New York delegation carried on their banners phrases from President\r\nWilson’s book, _The New Freedom_.\r\n\r\n          LIBERTY IS A FUNDAMENTAL DEMAND OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT.\r\n\r\n          WE ARE INTERESTED IN THE UNITED STATES, POLITICALLY\r\n                SPEAKING, IN NOTHING BUT HUMAN LIBERTY.\r\n\r\nOn College Day, thirteen colleges were represented, the biggest group\r\nfrom Goucher College, Baltimore. Then came Teachers’ Day; Patriotic Day,\r\nand Lincoln Day. On Patriotic Day, one of the banners read:\r\n\r\n            DENMARK ON THE VERGE OF WAR GAVE WOMEN THE VOTE.\r\n\r\n                 WHY NOT GIVE IT TO AMERICAN WOMEN NOW?\r\n\r\nOn Lincoln Day, they said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    WHY ARE YOU BEHIND LINCOLN?\r\n\r\n    AFTER THE CIVIL WAR WOMEN ASKED FOR POLITICAL FREEDOM.\r\n\r\n    THEY WERE TOLD TO WAIT—THIS WAS THE NEGRO’S HOUR.\r\n\r\n    IN 1917, AMERICAN WOMEN STILL ASK FOR FREEDOM.\r\n\r\n    WILL YOU, MR. PRESIDENT, TELL THEM TO WAIT—THAT THIS IS THE PORTO\r\n    RICAN’S HOUR?\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, February 18, came Labor Day on the picket line. It was, of\r\ncourse, impossible for wage-earning women to picket the White House on\r\nany other day. They represented not only office workers, but factory\r\nworkers from the great industrial centers. Many of them had come from\r\nother cities.\r\n\r\nSusan B. Anthony’s birthday, February 15, was celebrated impressively,\r\nalthough it rained and snowed heavily. Three new banners appeared that\r\nday. The first—big enough and golden enough even to suit that big,\r\ngolden woman—bore quotations from Susan B. Anthony:\r\n\r\n           WE PRESS OUR DEMAND FOR THE BALLOT AT THIS TIME IN\r\n         NO NARROW, CAPTIOUS, OR SELF-SEEKING SPIRIT, BUT FROM\r\n        PUREST PATRIOTISM FOR THE HIGHEST GOOD OF EVERY CITIZEN,\r\n           FOR THE SAFETY OF THE REPUBLIC, AND AS A GLORIOUS\r\n                  EXAMPLE TO THE NATIONS OF THE EARTH.\r\n\r\nThe second Susan B. Anthony banner said:\r\n\r\n          AT THIS TIME OUR GREATEST NEED IS NOT MEN OR MONEY,\r\n       VALIANT GENERALS OR BRILLIANT VICTORIES, BUT A CONSISTENT\r\n             NATIONAL POLICY BASED UPON THE PRINCIPLES THAT\r\n           ALL GOVERNMENTS DERIVE THEIR JUST POWERS FROM THE\r\n                        CONSENT OF THE GOVERNED.\r\n\r\nThe third Susan B. Anthony banner said:\r\n\r\n            THE RIGHT OF SELF-GOVERNMENT FOR ONE-HALF OF ITS\r\n         PEOPLE IS OF FAR MORE VITAL CONSEQUENCE TO THE NATION\r\n                    THAN ANY OR ALL OTHER QUESTIONS.\r\n\r\nOn March 2, 1917, the Congressional Union and its Western organization,\r\nthe Woman’s Party, met in joint convention and organized themselves into\r\nthe National Woman’s Party.\r\n\r\nOn that occasion, Alice Paul said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    We feel that by combining the Congressional Union and the Woman’s\r\n    Party we shall bring about a unity in organization which will make\r\n    impossible duplication, difference of opinion, and divergence of\r\n    method. By uniting we make, moreover, for unity of spirit in the\r\n    whole Suffrage movement, bringing the voters and non-voters together\r\n    in a movement in which they should both be integral parts.\r\n\r\n    The original purpose for which the Woman’s Party, as an organization\r\n    confined to women voters alone, was formed, has, we believe, been\r\n    served. In the first three years of our work we endeavored to call\r\n    the attention of political leaders and Congress to the fact that\r\n    women were voting and that these voting women were interested in\r\n    Suffrage. But words alone did not have much effect. We found we had\r\n    to visualize the existence of voting women out in the West and their\r\n    support of the Suffrage Amendment. The Woman’s Party was formed as\r\n    one means of doing this.\r\n\r\n    The Woman’s Party did, I believe, have an effect on the political\r\n    leaders. It was very clear, I think, at the convention in Chicago\r\n    and in St. Louis that the idea that women were voting and that those\r\n    women were interested in the Federal Amendment was at last\r\n    appreciated. This November’s election completed our work in getting\r\n    that fact into the minds of Congressmen and political leaders. There\r\n    is no longer any need to draw a line around women voters and set\r\n    them off by themselves in order to call attention to them. They now\r\n    enter into the calculations of every political observer.\r\n\r\n    If we amalgamate and make ourselves one great group of voters and\r\n    non-voters all working for the Federal Amendment, the question\r\n    arises: What name shall we be called by, the Congressional Union or\r\n    the Woman’s Party? Our Executive Committee felt that we ought to\r\n    keep the name of the Woman’s Party, because it stands for political\r\n    power.\r\n\r\n    The objections brought against this are, I think, two. First, that\r\n    non-voters should not, according to custom, be part of a political\r\n    Party; second, that if they are included, that Party will not\r\n    command as much respect as would a Party composed solely of voters.\r\n    There are non-voters in the Socialist, the Progressive, and the\r\n    Prohibition Parties; there is no reason why, if we are interested in\r\n    precedent and custom, they should not be in our Party also. As to\r\n    the second point: The Congressional Union has the reputation of\r\n    being an active, determined, and well-financed organization. When\r\n    the political world realizes that this young Woman’s Party has been\r\n    strengthened by the influx of twenty-five thousand workers of the\r\n    Congressional Union ready to give their service and money it will\r\n    consider that the Woman’s Party stands for more power than if formed\r\n    of the women of the Western States only.\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: WAGE EARNERS PICKETING THE WHITE HOUSE, FEBRUARY,\r\n    1917.\r\n    Photo Copr. Harris and Ewing, Washington, D. C.]\r\n\r\n\r\n    All of us in the Congressional Union feel an affection for it. But\r\n    that is no reason for continuing the organization. The Congressional\r\n    Union has served a useful purpose, we believe. But now that we have\r\n    created the Woman’s Party we ought, it seems to me, to develop and\r\n    make that the dominant Suffrage factor in this country because that,\r\n    through its name and associations, throws the emphasis more than\r\n    does the Congressional Union on the political power of women.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following officers were elected unanimously at the morning session:\r\nChairman of the National Woman’s Party, Alice Paul; Vice-Chairman, Anne\r\nMartin; Secretary, Mabel Vernon; Treasurer, Gertrude Crocker. The\r\nexecutive board elected were: Lucy Burns, Mrs. O. H. P. Belmont, Mrs. J.\r\nW. Brannan, Mrs. Gilson Gardner, Abby Scott Baker, Mrs. William Kent,\r\nMaud Younger, Doris Stevens, Florence Bayard Hilles, Mrs. Donald Hooker,\r\nMrs. J. A. H. Hopkins, and Mrs. Lawrence Lewis.\r\n\r\nAt that Convention, various resolutions were passed; the most notable in\r\nregard to the attitude of the National Woman’s Party towards the rapidly\r\ndeveloping war situation. That resolution runs as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Whereas the problems involved in the present international\r\n    situation, affecting the lives of millions of women in this country,\r\n    make imperative the enfranchisement of women,\r\n\r\n    Be it resolved that the National Woman’s Party, organized for the\r\n    sole purpose of securing political liberty for women, shall continue\r\n    to work for this purpose until it is accomplished, being unalterably\r\n    convinced that in so doing the organization serves the highest\r\n    interests of the country.\r\n\r\n    And be it further resolved that to this end we urge upon the\r\n    President and the Congress of the United States the immediate\r\n    passage of the National Suffrage Amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was decided to present these resolutions to the President. Shortly\r\nafter, Dudley Field Malone, Collector of the Port of New York, on behalf\r\nof the Woman’s Party, informed the President that a deputation would\r\nvisit him for that purpose.\r\n\r\nThis demonstration was not so much a protest at the failure of the first\r\nadministration to pass the Anthony Amendment, or at the adjournment of\r\nCongress without passing it, as a presentation of the demands of the\r\nNational Woman’s Party immediately upon the opening of President\r\nWilson’s second term.\r\n\r\nDuring the first three days in March, Washington filled steadily with\r\ninauguration crowds. When they got off the train, the Great Demand\r\nbanner of the National Woman’s Party confronted them, and girls handed\r\nthem slips inviting them to the demonstration of the National Woman’s\r\nParty at the White House on Inauguration Day and to the mass-meeting of\r\nthe National Woman’s Party to be held that night. Girls also stood in\r\ntheatre lobbies, handing out more of these slips. Girls made the rounds\r\nof the government departments, handing out still more. Everywhere great\r\nposters said:\r\n\r\n                  COME TO THE WHITE HOUSE ON MARCH 4.\r\n\r\n                           COME IN THOUSANDS.\r\n\r\nInauguration Day dawned a day of biting wind and slashing rain.\r\n\r\nOutside Headquarters was turmoil; inside a boiling activity. Hundreds of\r\nwomen were preparing to picket the White House. To accommodate them, a\r\nrubber company, hastily summoned, had commandeered one room and was\r\nselling rain-coats; tarpaulin hats; rubbers.\r\n\r\nAn extraordinary, a magnificent demonstration followed. To the music of\r\nseveral bands, nearly a thousand pickets circled the White House four\r\ntimes—a distance of four miles. Vida Milholland, the younger sister of\r\nInez Milholland, marched at the head, carrying on a golden banner her\r\nsister’s last words for Suffrage.\r\n\r\n          MR. PRESIDENT, HOW LONG MUST WOMEN WAIT FOR LIBERTY?\r\n\r\nThe Great Demand banner followed, carried by Mrs. Benton Mackaye:\r\n\r\n             WE DEMAND AN AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION OF\r\n                 THE UNITED STATES ENFRANCHISING WOMEN.\r\n\r\nBeulah Amidon carried the Suffrage banner which Inez Milholland bore in\r\nthe first Suffrage procession in New York:\r\n\r\n                       “Forward, Out Of Darkness,\r\n                        Leave Behind The Night.\r\n                        Forward Out Of Error,\r\n                        Forward Into Light.”\r\n\r\nBehind there came hundreds of women bearing the purple, white, and gold.\r\nThey were divided according to States; and before each division marched\r\nthe State flag of the division. The drenching rain fell steadily. The\r\npavements turned to shallow lakes, and the banners—their brilliancy\r\naccentuated by the wet—threw long, wavy reflections on the glassy, gray\r\nstreets. They were of course expecting this demonstration at the White\r\nHouse, and, as though it were dangerous, unusual precautions had been\r\ntaken against it. Every gate was locked. The Washington force of police\r\nofficers, augmented by police from Baltimore and by squads of\r\nplain-clothes men, guarded the grounds without and within. Gilson\r\nGardner said the President seemed to think the women were going to steal\r\nhis grass roots.\r\n\r\nThere was no one at the locked gates to receive the women or the\r\nresolutions except the guards; these guards protested that they had not\r\nbeen ordered to receive either. The women visited every gate, but\r\nreceived the same answer. The cards of the leaders were finally handed\r\nover to a guard to present at the White House. He tried to deliver them,\r\nbut was reprimanded for leaving his post, and sent back. Learning that\r\nthe cards would be delivered at the end of the day, as is the custom\r\nwith visiting-cards of casual visitors at the White House, the thousand\r\npickets took up their march again.\r\n\r\nGilson Gardner wrote of this demonstration:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The weather gave this affair its character. Had there been fifteen\r\n    hundred women carrying banners on a fair day, the sight would have\r\n    been a pretty one. But to see a thousand women—young women,\r\n    middle-aged and old women—and there were women in the line who had\r\n    passed their three score and ten—marching in a rain that almost\r\n    froze as it fell; to see them standing and marching and holding\r\n    their heavy banners, momentarily growing heavier—holding them\r\n    against a wind that was half gale—hour after hour, until their\r\n    gloves were wet, their clothes soaked through; to see them later\r\n    with hands sticky from the varnish from the banner poles—bare hands,\r\n    for the gloves had by this time been pulled off, and the hands were\r\n    blue with cold—to see these women keep their lines and go through\r\n    their program fully, losing only those who fainted or fell from\r\n    exhaustion, was a sight to impress even the dulled and jaded senses\r\n    of one who has seen much.\r\n\r\n    One young woman from North Dakota I saw clinging to the iron pickets\r\n    around the White House, her banner temporarily abandoned, fighting\r\n    against what was to her a new feeling, faintness resulting from the\r\n    pain in her hands. She was brought to the automobile in which I was\r\n    riding before she actually fell to the ground; but after a short\r\n    rest she was back in the line, and finished with the others.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that what Gilson Gardner said was true—the weather\r\ngave this affair its character.\r\n\r\nPeople passing by, thrilled by the gallantry of the marchers, joined the\r\nprocession. And as Gilson Gardner says, it was not because it was a\r\npretty sight, or because these women were all young. Anna Norris Kendall\r\nof Wisconsin, seventy-two years old, and the Rev. Olympia Brown,\r\neighty-two years old, one of the pioneer Suffragists of the country,\r\nboth took part.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE THOUSAND PICKETS TRY VAINLY TO DELIVER THEIR\r\nRESOLUTIONS TO THE PRESIDENT, MARCH 4, 1917.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A THOUSAND PICKETS MARCHING AROUND THE WHITE HOUSE, MARCH\r\n4, 1917.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThat day, a newly elected Congressman drove about Washington, showing\r\nthe city to his wife. He had always been a Suffragist. She had always\r\nbeen an anti-Suffragist. The sudden sight of the thousand women marching\r\nin the rain not only converted her, but it produced such an effect on\r\nher she burst into tears.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLater, President Wilson sent a letter to the National Woman’s Party,\r\nacknowledging the resolutions presented to him by the deputations of\r\nMarch 4, and concluded: “May I not once more express my sincere interest\r\nin the cause of Woman Suffrage?”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCongress adjourned on March 3, 1917. The pickets adjourned with it. On\r\nApril 2, a Special War Session of Congress convened. The _Suffragist_\r\ngives an interesting description of that interesting day.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Just half an hour before Congress formally opened, the Suffrage\r\n    sentinels at the Capitol took their places.... There was tensity in\r\n    the atmosphere. The Capitol grounds were overrun with pacifists from\r\n    many cities wearing white-lettered badges; and with war advocates,\r\n    as plainly labeled, with partisan demands. They swarmed over the\r\n    Capitol grounds unmolested, though extra precautions were taken\r\n    throughout the day and in the evening when troops of cavalry were\r\n    called out. The silent sentinels stood unmoved the while for\r\n    democracy while peace and war agitation eddied around them.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe pickets convened with Congress. They continued to stand at the gates\r\nof the White House, but they extended their line to the Capitol. Three\r\npickets, led by Elsie Hill, took up their station by the House entrance\r\nand three by the Senate entrance. At night—this evoked from the\r\nnewspapers sly allusions to the Trojan horse—they used to store their\r\nbanners in the House Office Building.\r\n\r\nOn April 7, the United States declared itself to be at war with Germany.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter war was declared, the Woman’s Party continued—and continued with\r\nan increasing force and eloquence—to demand the enfranchisement of the\r\nwomen of the United States by Constitutional Amendment. This brought\r\ndown upon their heads a storm of criticism; antagonism; hostility. But\r\nAlice Paul was not deflected by it from her purpose. She recalled that,\r\nat the outbreak of the Civil War, Suffragists of that day, were\r\nentreated to relinquish their Suffrage work in favor of war work. They\r\nwere promised that, at the end of the war, they would be enfranchised.\r\nSusan B. Anthony complied with great reluctance, carried on, against her\r\nwill, by the majority of those who surrounded her.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the war, the black man was enfranchised. The white women\r\nhad been asking for the vote ever since.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEvery effort was made to shake this young leader in her fearless stand.\r\nAll kinds of people came to her and begged her to give up the picketing.\r\nOne strong friend, a newspaper man, said, “It’s as though you opened the\r\nwindows and said, ‘There’s a nice big cyclone coming. Come out of your\r\ncyclone-cellars, girls, and let’s go in it!’” Denunciations, violence,\r\nmobs, murders were predicted.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was no officer of the National Woman’s Party who did not realize\r\nwhat it meant to go on with such a fight at such a time.\r\n\r\nThey determined, whatever befell, not to lower their banners; to hold\r\nthem high.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAlice Paul announced in the editorial columns of the _Suffragist_, that\r\nmembers of the Woman’s Party would, if they so desired, work for war\r\nthrough various organizations, especially organized for war work, but\r\nthat the Woman’s Party itself would continue to work only for the\r\nenfranchisement of women.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe eyes of the world were now turned on the White House. Distinguished\r\nmen from all over the country visited the President. Foreign missions\r\ncame one after another.\r\n\r\nPicturesque events continued to happen on the picket line. Arthur\r\nBalfour, the leader of the British Mission, called at the White House to\r\npay his respects. He was confronted with forty pickets. Their banners\r\nwere inscribed with the President’s own words:\r\n\r\n\r\n    WE SHALL FIGHT FOR THE THINGS WHICH WE HAVE ALWAYS HELD NEAREST OUR\r\n    HEARTS—FOR DEMOCRACY, FOR THE RIGHT OF THOSE WHO SUBMIT TO AUTHORITY\r\n    TO HAVE A VOICE IN THEIR OWN GOVERNMENTS.—President Wilson’s War\r\n    Message, April 2, 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis quotation from the President’s words became a slogan among the\r\nSuffragists.\r\n\r\nThe pickets recalled that when Arthur Balfour used to emerge into\r\nDowning Street, where the English militants were producing a\r\ndemonstration, he always wore a bunch of violets in his buttonhole, to\r\nshow his sympathy with them.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe spring brought its usual beautiful metamorphosis to Washington. If\r\nthe pickets had seemed beautiful in the winter, they were quadruply so\r\nwhen the fresh green came. Everywhere that luxuriance of foliage,\r\nexquisitely tender and soft, which marks Washington, made an intensive\r\nbackground for their great golden banners and their tri-color. The\r\npickets found it a delightfully humorous coincidence that, when they\r\ncame to take up their station at the White House, the White House lawns\r\nwere ablaze with their tri-color—the white of hyacinths, the purple of\r\nazalea, and the gold of forsythia. The Little White House itself was not\r\nexempt from this burst of bloom. The huge wistaria vine on its façade\r\nturned to a purple cascade; and out of it spirted the purple, white, and\r\ngold of their tri-color and the red, white, and blue of the national\r\nbanner. When the French Commission, including Joffre and Viviani, passed\r\nall this massed color, they leaped to their feet, waving their hats and\r\nshouting their approval.\r\n\r\nOn June 20, the Mission headed by Bakmetief, sent by the new Russian\r\nRepublic which had just enfranchised its women, was officially received\r\nby President Wilson. When they reached the White House gates, they were\r\nconfronted by a big banner—since known as the “Russian” banner—borne by\r\nLucy Burns and Mrs. Lawrence Lewis.\r\n\r\n         PRESIDENT WILSON AND ENVOY ROOT ARE DECEIVING RUSSIA.\r\n             THEY SAY “WE ARE A DEMOCRACY. HELP US WIN THE\r\n                 WAR SO THAT DEMOCRACIES MAY SURVIVE.”\r\n           WE WOMEN OF AMERICA TELL YOU THAT AMERICA IS NOT A\r\n             DEMOCRACY. TWENTY MILLION WOMEN ARE DENIED THE\r\n         RIGHT TO VOTE. PRESIDENT WILSON IS THE CHIEF OPPONENT\r\n                   OF THEIR NATIONAL ENFRANCHISEMENT.\r\n             HELP US MAKE THIS NATION REALLY FREE. TELL OUR\r\n           GOVERNMENT THAT IT MUST LIBERATE ITS PEOPLE BEFORE\r\n                  IT CAN CLAIM FREE RUSSIA AS AN ALLY.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of this banner produced strange results. A man standing\r\nat the White House gates leaped at it—the instant the Russian Mission\r\nhad vanished—and tore the sign from its supports.\r\n\r\nThe crowd closed in around them. The two women continued to stand facing\r\nthem. Nina Allender, who saw this from across the street, said that the\r\nsurging back and forth of straw hats as the crowd closed in upon the\r\nwomen gave her a sense of faintness. “One instant the banners were\r\nthere, the next there were only bare sticks.”\r\n\r\nLater, a prominent member of the Mission said to a no less prominent\r\nAmerican, “You know, it was very embarrassing for us, because we were in\r\nsympathy with those women at the gates.”\r\n\r\nThe next day, June 21, Lucy Burns and Katherine Morey carried a banner\r\nwhich was the duplicate of the one borne the day before to the lower\r\nWhite House gate. Before they could set it up some boys destroyed it.\r\nThe police did not interfere; they looked placidly on. Immediately other\r\nbanners were sent off from Headquarters. Hazel Hunkins carried one which\r\nsaid harmlessly:\r\n\r\n                    DEMOCRACY SHOULD BEGIN AT HOME.\r\n\r\nThe crowds gathered and surged up and down the street but the two\r\npickets stood motionless. Nothing happened for a while. Then a man, who\r\nstopped to congratulate Miss Hunkins, was applauded by the crowd. It is\r\nan interesting example of mob psychology that after this applause such\r\nan incident as happened five minutes later could happen. A woman of the\r\nWar Department, who had been boasting that morning in her office that\r\nshe was going to do this, attacked Hazel Hunkins. She tore the banners\r\nand spat on them. The avenue was crowded with government clerks and they\r\nimmediately fell on the banners and destroyed them after a struggle.\r\nKatherine Morey, who was lunching at Headquarters, says in almost\r\nBunyanesque language: “And I heard a great roar.” She ran towards the\r\nWhite House gates and saw that the mobs had charged the pickets, had\r\ntorn the banners into shreds. The mob then rushed to the other gate,\r\npicketed by Catherine Lowry and Lillian Crans. After a struggle, their\r\nbanners also were destroyed. Lillian Crans ran to Headquarters for\r\nanother banner, carrying the news of what had happened.\r\n\r\nImmediately, there emerged from the Little White House four women led by\r\nMabel Vernon, carrying purple, white, and gold banners. It was a moment\r\nof tension, and the pickets were white-faced with that tension. This\r\nsilent, persistent courage had, however, its inevitable effect on the\r\ncrowd. It fell back. Before it could recover from its interval of\r\nindecision, the police met the groups of girls, and conducted them to\r\ntheir places. Police reserves ultimately appeared, and cleared the crowd\r\nfrom Pennsylvania Avenue. The pickets kept guard the rest of the day in\r\npeace. One of them even did her war-time knitting.\r\n\r\nAbout this time a prominent newspaper man was sent to Alice Paul by the\r\npowers that be, on a mission of intervention. He told her it was feared\r\nthe President might be assassinated by some one in the crowds that the\r\npickets collected.\r\n\r\n“Is the Administration willing to have us make this public?” Alice Paul\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n“Oh, no!” was the answer.\r\n\r\nAlice Paul replied, “The picketing will go on as usual.”\r\n\r\nSo now Major Pullman, Chief of Police for the District of Columbia,\r\ncalled at Headquarters. He told Alice Paul that if the pickets went out\r\nagain they would be arrested. Alice Paul answered in effect:\r\n\r\n“Why has picketing suddenly become illegal? Our lawyers have assured us\r\nall along that picketing was legal. Certainly it is as legal in June as\r\nin January.” She concluded, “The picketing will go on as usual.”\r\n\r\nMajor Pullman then told her again that the pickets would be arrested if\r\nthey went out.\r\n\r\nAlice Paul replied, “The picketing will go on as usual.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe next morning, June 22, Miss Paul telephoned Major Pullman that the\r\npickets were going out with the banners. Rows of policemen stood outside\r\nHeadquarters. However, that did not daunt the pickets. Suffragists began\r\nto come out; return; emerge again. All this made so much coming and\r\ngoing that, when Mabel Vernon appeared, carrying a box under her arm,\r\nnobody paid any attention. That box, however, contained a banner. Miss\r\nVernon crossed to the park and sat down. Presently Lucy Burns came out\r\nof Headquarters and walked leisurely in one direction; a little later\r\nKatherine Morey came out, and strolled in another direction. At a given\r\nmoment these two women met at the East gate of the White House. Mabel\r\nVernon joined them with the banner. They set it up and stood undisturbed\r\nin front of the White House for several minutes. Suddenly one of the\r\npolicemen caught sight of them: “The little devils!” he exclaimed: “Can\r\nyou beat that!”\r\n\r\nThe banner carried the President’s own words: “We shall fight for the\r\nthings, etc.”\r\n\r\nThe day before the police had been in a bad quandary. Now they were in a\r\nworse one: it did not seem reasonable to arrest such a banner. One\r\npoliceman did, however, start to do so. “My God, man, you can’t arrest\r\nthat,” another policeman remonstrated. “Them’s the President’s own\r\nwords.” They did make the arrest, though—after seven minutes of\r\nindecision. When the prisoners arrived at the police station Lucy Burns\r\nasked what the charge was: “Charge! Charge!” the policeman said,\r\nobviously much puzzled: “We don’t know what the charge is yet. We’ll\r\ntelephone you that later.”\r\n\r\nThese two, Lucy Burns and Katherine Morey, were the first of the long\r\nlist of women to be arrested for picketing the White House. They were,\r\nhowever, never brought to trial.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      _2. The Peaceful Reception_\r\n\r\n                       THE YOUNG ARE AT THE GATES\r\n\r\n\r\n    If any one says to me: “Why the picketing for Suffrage?” I should\r\n    say in reply, “Why the fearless spirit of youth? Why does it exist\r\n    and make itself manifest?”\r\n\r\n    Is it not really that our whole social world would be likely to\r\n    harden and toughen into a dreary mass of conventional negations and\r\n    forbiddances—into hopeless layers of conformity and caste, did not\r\n    the irrepressible energy and animation of youth, when joined to the\r\n    clear-eyed sham-hating intelligence of the young, break up the dull\r\n    masses and set a new pace for laggards to follow?\r\n\r\n    What is the potent spirit of youth? Is it not the spirit of revolt,\r\n    of rebellion against senseless and useless and deadening things?\r\n    Most of all, against injustice, which is of all stupid things the\r\n    stupidest?\r\n\r\n    Such thoughts come to one in looking over the field of the Suffrage\r\n    campaign and watching the pickets at the White House and at the\r\n    Capitol, where sit the men who complacently enjoy the rights they\r\n    deny to the women at their gates. Surely, nothing but the creeping\r\n    paralysis of mental old age can account for the phenomenon of\r\n    American men, law-makers, officials, administrators, and guardians\r\n    of the peace, who can see nothing in the intrepid young pickets with\r\n    their banners, asking for bare justice but common obstructors of\r\n    traffic, naggers—nuisances that are to be abolished by passing\r\n    stupid laws forbidding and repressing to add to the old junk-heap of\r\n    laws which forbid and repress? Can it be possible that any brain\r\n    cells not totally crystallized could imagine that giving a stone\r\n    instead of bread would answer conclusively the demand of the women\r\n    who, because they are young, fearless, eager, and rebellious, are\r\n    fighting and winning a cause for all women—even for those who are\r\n    timid, conventional, and inert?\r\n\r\n    A fatal error—a losing fight. The old stiff minds must give way. The\r\n    old selfish minds must go. Obstructive reactionaries must move on.\r\n    The young are at the gates!\r\n\r\n                   LAVINIA DOCK.\r\n\r\n              _The Suffragist_, June 30, 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis hostility in June had worked up suddenly after the five quiet\r\nmonths, during which the Woman’s Party had been peacefully picketing the\r\nWhite House. Perhaps their immunity was at first due to the fact that\r\nwhen the picketing in January began, the people in Washington did not\r\nexpect it to last. “When the rain comes, they will go,” Washingtonians\r\nsaid, and then, as the line still continued to appear, “When the snow\r\ncomes, they will go.” But, instead of going with the rain, the pickets\r\nwaited for Smith, the janitor, to bring them slickers and sou’westers.\r\nAnd instead of leaving with the snow, they only put on heavier coats.\r\nThe pickets became an institution.\r\n\r\nIt is true, too, that, though that picket line was a surprise to every\r\none (and to many a shock) to some it was a joke.\r\n\r\nThere was one Congressman, for instance, who took it humorously. He said\r\nto Nina Allender, when the Suffragists began to picket the Special War\r\nSession of Congress:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “The other day, a man covered the gravestones in a cemetery with\r\n    posters which read: ‘Rise up! Your country needs you!’ Now that was\r\n    poor publicity. I consider yours equally poor.”\r\n\r\n    “But,” replied Mrs. Allender, “we are not picketing a graveyard. We\r\n    are picketing Congress. We believe there are a few live ones left\r\n    there.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Congressman admitted that he had laid himself wide open to this.\r\n\r\nBut, from the very beginning, there were those who did not consider it a\r\njoke. The first day the pickets appeared, a gentleman—old and\r\nwhite-haired—stopped to stare at the band of floating color. He read the\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n\r\n    MR. PRESIDENT, HOW LONG MUST WOMEN WAIT FOR LIBERTY?\r\n\r\n\r\nThen he took off his hat, and held it off, bowing his white head to each\r\nof the six silent sentinels. Having passed them, he covered his head\r\nagain. But he repeated this reverential formality as he passed the six\r\nwomen at the other gate.\r\n\r\nOne Washingtonian took his children out to see the picket line. He told\r\nthem he wanted them to witness history in the making.\r\n\r\nThat first day when the President came out for his daily afternoon\r\ndrive, he seemed utterly unaware of the pickets; but the next day he\r\nlaughed with frank good-nature as he passed, and thereafter he too bared\r\nhis head as he drove between them.\r\n\r\nIt was the intention at first for these sentinels to keep complete\r\nsilence. But, as the throngs hurrying past began to question them,\r\ncontinued to question them, conversation became inevitable.\r\n\r\nThe commonest question, of course, was, “Why are you doing this?”\r\n\r\nThe pickets always answered, “The President asked us to concert public\r\nopinion before we could expect anything of him. We are concerting it\r\nupon him.” The second most popular question was, “Why don’t you go to\r\nCongress?” The answer, “We have—again and again and again; and they tell\r\nus if the President wants it, it will go through.”\r\n\r\nThat hurrying crowd was made up of many types. In the early morning and\r\nthe late afternoon, government clerks predominated. Almost as many were\r\nthe sight-seers from every part of the country. Then there were\r\ndiplomats, newspapermen, schoolboys, and schoolgirls, and the matinée\r\ncrowds. In the streets came the endless file of motor-cars, filled\r\nmainly with women going to teas. Many people pretended not to see the\r\nsentinels. They would walk straight ahead with an impassive expression,\r\ncasting furtive, side-long glances at the banners. Again and again, the\r\npickets enjoyed the wicked satisfaction of seeing them walk straight\r\ninto the wire wickets which enclosed the Pennsylvania Avenue trees. At\r\nfirst, Congressmen tried not to see what was going on. After a while,\r\nhowever, they too stopped to chat with the pickets. One Congressman told\r\nMrs. Gilson Gardner that he felt there was “something religious about\r\nthat bannered picket line; that it had already become to him a part of\r\nthe modern religion of this country.”\r\n\r\nAnother Congressman, who had been opposed at first to the picketing,\r\ncalled out one day, “That’s right. Keep it up! Don’t let us forget you\r\nfor a moment!”\r\n\r\nAll kinds of pretty incidents occurred. Once, Ex-Senator Henry W. Blair\r\nvisited the picket line. He had been a friend of Susan B. Anthony, and\r\nhe made the first speech ever delivered in the Senate in favor of\r\nSuffrage. White-haired, keen-eyed, walking with a crutch and a stick, he\r\ncame along the line of pickets, greeting each one of them in turn—ninety\r\nyears old.\r\n\r\n“And I, too, have been a picket,” said General Sherwood to them.\r\n\r\n“I salute you as soldiers in a great revolution,” said one chance\r\npasser-by to the Women Workers’ Delegation on Labor Day. And—struck\r\napparently by the high spiritual quality in the beautiful procession—a\r\nwoman, a stranger to them, remarked to the pickets: “I wonder if you\r\nrealize what a mediæval spectacle you young women present. You have made\r\nus realize that this cause is a crusade.”\r\n\r\nWorkmen digging trenches in the streets discussed the matter among\r\nthemselves. Picketing is an institution very dear to the heart of Labor.\r\nThese men showed their sympathy by devising and making supports for the\r\nbanners. They offered to make benches for the pickets, but agreed with\r\nthe women when they said that sentinels must stand, not sit, at their\r\nposts.\r\n\r\nWhen the Confederate Reunion occurred in Washington, many of the feeble,\r\nwhite-haired men in their worn Confederate grey and their faded\r\nConfederate badges, stopped to talk with the pickets. I quote the\r\n_Suffragist_:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “We-all came out early to see the sights,” said one. “We went three\r\n    times around this place, and I thought the big house in the center\r\n    was the White House. But we weren’t sure—not until you girls came\r\n    out with your flags and stood here. ‘This is sure enough where the\r\n    President lives,’ I said, ‘here are the Suffrage pickets and there\r\n    are the purple and gold flags we read about down home.’ You are\r\n    brave girls.”\r\n\r\n\r\n    One old soldier, hat off, said, “I have picketed in my time. And now\r\n    it is your turn, you young folks. You have the courage. You are\r\n    going to put it through.”\r\n\r\n    That was the note many of them sounded. “Girls, you are right,” a\r\n    third encouraged them. “I have been through wars, and I know.\r\n    You-all got to have some rights.”\r\n\r\n    Even the anti-Suffragists were moved sometimes. One of them said: “I\r\n    have never been impressed by Suffragists before, but the sincerity\r\n    you express in being willing to stand here in all weathers for the\r\n    thing you believe in makes me think that there is something in the\r\n    Suffrage fight after all.”\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd yet, Suffragists themselves were occasionally antagonistic. “You\r\nhave put the Suffrage cause back fifty years!” said one. She little\r\nsuspected that, within a year, the House of Representatives would have\r\npassed the Amendment; within less than two years thereafter the Senate.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPeople went further than words. Many paused to shake hands. Many asked\r\nto be allowed to hold the banners for a moment.\r\n\r\nOnce a bride and groom—very young—stopped. The groom talked to one\r\npicket, the bride to another. The man said: “I think this is outrageous.\r\nI have no sympathy with you whatever. I wouldn’t any more let my wife——”\r\nAt that moment the little bride came rushing up, radiant. “Oh, do you\r\nmind,” she said to her husband, “if I hold one of those banners for a\r\nwhile?”\r\n\r\n“No, if you want to,” the bridegroom answered.\r\n\r\nAnd she took her stand on the picket line.\r\n\r\nChildren stopped to spell out the inscriptions, and sometimes asked what\r\nthey meant.\r\n\r\nOnce, a group of boys from a Massachusetts school inquired what the\r\ncolors stood for, and asked to have the slogan translated. As by one\r\nimpulse, they lifted their hats and said, “You ought to have it now.”\r\n\r\nOccasionally, distinguished visitors leaving the White House would smile\r\ntheir appreciation and approval. On one occasion Theodore Roosevelt\r\nbeamed vividly on the pickets, waving his hat as he passed. As the\r\nweather changed and the winter storms began, the gaiety in the attitude\r\nof their audience deepened to a real admiration. With the rains, the\r\npickets appeared in slickers and rubber hats. This was not, of course,\r\nunendurable. But, when the freezing cold came, often with snow and\r\nswirling winds, picketing became a real hardship. There were days when\r\nit was almost impossible to stand on the picket line for more than half\r\nan hour at a time. At regular intervals, Smith, the janitor, assisted at\r\ntimes by a little colored boy, used to appear from Headquarters,\r\ntrundling a wheelbarrow. That wheelbarrow was piled high with hot bricks\r\ncovered with gunny-sacking. He would distribute the bricks among the\r\npickets and they would stand on them. An observer said that, when the\r\nrelay of pickets, leaving at the end of the day, stepped down from the\r\nbricks at the word of command, it was like a line of statues stepping\r\nfrom their pedestals.\r\n\r\nBut others—and sometimes strangers—sought to mitigate for the pickets\r\nthe rigors of the freezing weather. One woman, coming regularly every\r\nday in her car, brought thermos bottles filled with hot coffee. On one\r\noccasion, a young girl—a passing volunteer—came on picket duty in a coat\r\ntoo light and shoes too low. While she stood there, a closed limousine\r\ndrew up to the curb. A woman alighted and forced the girl to retire to\r\nher car and put on her fur coat and her gaiters. The stranger held the\r\nbanner while the warming-up process was going on. She offered to\r\norganize a committee, made up of older women, who would collect warm\r\nclothing for the pickets. In point of fact, the Virginia and\r\nPhiladelphia branches of the Congressional Union presented the pickets\r\nwith thick gloves, spats, and slickers for rainy days. Thousands of men\r\nand women from all over the country sent suggestions for their comfort.\r\n\r\nOfficial kindness, even, was not lacking. One superlatively cold day, an\r\nattaché of the President invited the whole company of pickets into the\r\nEast Room of the White House. The superintendents of the Treasury\r\nBuilding and the War Department Annex extended to them similar\r\ninvitations.\r\n\r\nThe police were, at the beginning, friendly, not only in words but in\r\nacts. An officer stopped one day, after telephoning at the near police\r\nbox, to say: “You are making friends every minute. Stick to it! Do not\r\ngive up. We are with you and admire your pluck.” The majority of them\r\ndid not like to do what afterwards they had to do.\r\n\r\nAs for the White House guards—they were the champions of the pickets. At\r\nthe outbreak of the war, the White House gates were closed for the first\r\ntime in its history. The pickets without often informed the guards\r\nwithin as to the kind of vehicle that demanded entrance of them. The\r\nguards came to treat them as comrades patrolling the same beat. Once,\r\nwhen the pickets were five minutes late, one of these guards said: “We\r\nthought you weren’t coming, and we’d have to hold down this place\r\nalone.”\r\n\r\nWhen the pickets reconvened with the Special War Session of the\r\nSixty-fifth Congress on April 2, the White House police were most\r\ndemonstrative in their welcome. They were glad to see them back: they\r\nsaid they had missed them. And indeed they had come to look on the women\r\nas a kind of auxiliary police force. Once, when somebody asked a\r\npoliceman, “When is the President coming out?” Mary Gertrude Fendall\r\nsaid, “I guess you’d like a dollar for every time people ask you that.”\r\nThe policeman answered, “I’d rather have a dollar for every time they\r\nask when are the Suffragists coming out?” The country at large had\r\naccepted the pickets. The directors of the sight-seeing busses pointed\r\nthem out as one of the city’s sights. Tourists said, oftener and\r\noftener, “Well, we weren’t quite sure where the White House was until we\r\nsaw you pickets.” And when these tourists used to crowd about the gates,\r\nwaiting for the President’s limousine to come out, and the signal was\r\nflashed that the Presidential motor had started, the guards pressed the\r\ncrowds away. “Back!” they would order. “Back! Back! All back but the\r\npickets! No one allowed inside the line but the pickets!”\r\n\r\nAs can be imagined, Headquarters was a busy place during the picketing;\r\nand sometimes a hectic one. Later, of course, when the arrests began,\r\nand mobs besieged it, it seethed with excitement. It was not easy always\r\nto find women with the leisure and the inclination to serve on the\r\npicket line before the arrests. But, when arrests began and\r\nimprisonments followed, naturally it became increasingly difficult.\r\n\r\nMany members of the Woman’s Party in Washington looked on their\r\npicketing as a part of the day’s work. Mrs. William Kent, who said that\r\nno public service she had ever done gave her such an exalted feeling,\r\nalways excused herself early from teas on Monday. “I picket Mondays from\r\ntwo to six,” she explained simply.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWatchers said that those high groups of purple, white, and gold banners\r\ncoming down the streets of Washington were like the sails, magically\r\nvivid and luminous, of some strange ship. They were indeed the sails of\r\na ship—the mightiest that women ever launched—but only the women who\r\nmanned those sails saw that ship.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      _3. The War on the Pickets_\r\n\r\n\r\n    “I have no son to give my country to fight for democracy abroad and\r\n    so I send my daughter to Washington to fight for democracy at home.”\r\n\r\n                                         Mrs. S. H. B. GRAY of Colorado.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that the arrest of Lucy Burns and Katherine\r\nMorey—the first of a series extending over more than a year—occurred on\r\nJune 22.\r\n\r\nOn June 23, Mrs. Lawrence Lewis and Gladys Greiner were arrested in\r\nfront of the White House. On the same day, Mabel Vernon and Virginia\r\nArnold were arrested at the Capitol.\r\n\r\nOn June 25, twenty women bore Suffrage banners to their stations. The\r\nslogans on these banners were:\r\n\r\n                 HOW LONG MUST WOMEN WAIT FOR LIBERTY?\r\n\r\n            MR. PRESIDENT, YOU SAY “LIBERTY IS A FUNDAMENTAL\r\n                      DEMAND OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT.”\r\n\r\n           WE ADDRESS OUR DEMAND FOR THE BALLOT AT THIS TIME\r\n          IN NO NARROW, CAPTIOUS, OR SELFISH SPIRIT, BUT FROM\r\n        PUREST PATRIOTISM FOR THE HIGHEST GOOD OF EVERY CITIZEN\r\n        FOR THE SAFETY OF THE REPUBLIC AND AS A GLORIOUS EXAMPLE\r\n                      TO THE NATIONS OF THE EARTH.\r\n\r\nTwelve women were arrested. They were: Mabel Vernon, Lucy Burns, Gladys\r\nGreiner, Katherine Morey, Elizabeth Stuyvesant, Lavinia Dock, Berta\r\nCrone, Pauline Clarke, Virginia Arnold, Maude Jamison, Annie Arniel, and\r\nMrs. Townsend Scott.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, June 26, nine women were arrested for carrying the same\r\nbanners. They included some of the women from the day before, and, in\r\naddition, Vivian Pierce and Hazel Hunkins.\r\n\r\nA high-handed detail of this arrest was that the women were overpowered\r\nby the police before they had proceeded half a block.\r\n\r\nMost of these women were released after each arrest. The last six to be\r\narrested were asked to return to court for trial.\r\n\r\nOn June 27, six American women were tried in the police court of the\r\nDistrict of Columbia.\r\n\r\nThese women were: Virginia Arnold, Lavinia Dock, Maud Jamison, Katherine\r\nMorey, Annie Arniel, Mabel Vernon.\r\n\r\nThe women defended themselves. Mabel Vernon, who conducted the case,\r\ndemanded that the banners they had carried be exhibited in court. It\r\nmade a comic episode in the midst of the court proceedings when the\r\npoliceman, who had been sent for them, returned, bristling all over his\r\nperson with banner sticks, and trailing in every direction the purple,\r\nwhite, and gold. The courtroom crowd burst out laughing when they read\r\nthe legend:\r\n\r\n\r\n    MR. PRESIDENT, YOU SAY “LIBERTY IS THE FUNDAMENTAL DESIRE OF THE\r\n    HUMAN SPIRIT.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a technical discussion as to how much sidewalk space the young\r\nwomen occupied, and how near the White House palings they stood. The\r\nSuffrage group had photographs which showed the deserted pavements at\r\nthe time of the arrests.\r\n\r\nThe women cross-examined the police who testified that there was no\r\ncrowd at that time of the morning and that the women stood with their\r\nbacks to the White House fence.\r\n\r\nThe Judge said: “If you had kept on moving, you would be all right.”\r\n\r\n“I find these defendants guilty as charged,” was his verdict, “of\r\nobstructing the highway in violation of the police regulations and the\r\nAct of Congress, and impose a fine of twenty-five dollars in each case,\r\nor in default of that, three days’ imprisonment.”\r\n\r\nThe six young women refused to pay the fine. They were each sentenced to\r\nthree days in the District jail.\r\n\r\nWhen the first pickets came out of jail, a hundred women, representing\r\nmany States, gave them a reception breakfast in the garden of Cameron\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\nA subsequent chapter will relate the prison experiences of these women\r\nand of the long line of their successors.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe next picket line went out on Independence Day, July 4, 1917. Five\r\nwomen marched from Headquarters bearing purple, white, and gold banners.\r\nThey were: Helena Hill Weed, Vida Milholland, Gladys Greiner, Margaret\r\nWhittemore, Iris Calderhead. Helena Hill Weed carried a banner:\r\n\r\n                GOVERNMENTS DERIVE THEIR JUST POWER FROM\r\n                      THE CONSENT OF THE GOVERNED.\r\n\r\nFollowing the advice of the Judge, they kept moving. Across the street,\r\na crowd had gathered in expectation of arrests. Standing about were\r\npolicemen—a newspaper man said twenty-nine. The police walked along\r\nparallel with the women, and the crowd followed them. As the banner\r\nbearers crossed the street to the White House, the police seized them\r\nbefore they could get onto the sidewalks. An augmenting crowd surged\r\nabout them. Some of the onlookers protested, but most of them took their\r\ncue from the police, and tore the flags away from the women. Apart from\r\nthe pickets, Kitty Marion, who for some weeks had been selling the\r\n_Suffragist_ on the streets, was attacked by a by-stander who snatched\r\nher papers away from her, tearing one of them up. Miss Marion was\r\narrested. She protested at the behavior of her assailant and he was\r\narrested too. Hazel Hunkins, who was not a part of the procession, came\r\nupon a man who had seized one of the banners carried by the pickets and\r\nwas bearing it away. Miss Hunkins attempted to get it from him, and she\r\nalso was arrested.\r\n\r\nThe police commandeered automobiles, and commenced bundling the women\r\ninto them.\r\n\r\nImmediately another group of women came marching up Pennsylvania Avenue\r\non the opposite side of the street. This second group contained Mrs.\r\nFrances Green, Mrs. Lawrence Lewis, Lucile Shields, Joy Young, Elizabeth\r\nStuyvesant, Lucy Burns. Joy Young, who is a little creature, led this\r\ngroup. They reached the West gate of the White House, and there the\r\npolice arrested them. A Washington paper described with great glee how,\r\nlike a tigress, little Joy Young fought to retain her banner, and how\r\nfinally three policemen managed to overpower her. The women were booked\r\nfor “unlawful assembly” all except Kitty Marion, who was charged with\r\n“disorderly conduct.”\r\n\r\nHelena Hill Weed and Lucy Burns cross-examined the witnesses on behalf\r\nof the women. Mrs. Weed insisted that the torn, yellow banner should be\r\nbrought into court. Throughout the trial, it hung suspended from the\r\nJudge’s bench—GOVERNMENTS DERIVE THEIR JUST POWERS FROM THE CONSENT OF\r\nTHE GOVERNED. Lucy Burns, examining the police officers, asked why\r\ncitizens carrying banners on June 21 were protected by the police, and\r\non July 4 arrested for doing the same thing. The officer replied that\r\nthey were protected on June 21 because he had no orders for that day.\r\nThe orders which came later were, he said, not to allow picketing,\r\nthough he admitted there were no directions about seizing banners. The\r\nwomen brought out by skillful cross-questioning that it was the action\r\nof the police which had collected a disorderly crowd, and not the\r\nmarching of the two groups of women; that at the former trial of a group\r\nof Suffrage pickets, the Judge himself had declared that marching\r\npickets did not violate the law.\r\n\r\nLucy Burns summed up the case for the Suffragists as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I wish to state first—she said—as the others have stated, that we\r\n    proceeded quietly down the street opposite the White House with our\r\n    banners; that we intended to keep marching; that our progress was\r\n    halted by the police, not the crowd. There was no interference on\r\n    the part of the crowd until after the police had arrested us and\r\n    turned their backs on the crowd. Our contention is as others have\r\n    stated that the presence of the crowd there was caused by the action\r\n    of the police and the previous announcement of the police that they\r\n    would arrest the pickets, and not by our action which was entirely\r\n    legal.\r\n\r\n    In the second place I wish to call your attention to the fact that\r\n    there is no law whatever against our carrying banners through the\r\n    streets of Washington, or in front of the White House. It has been\r\n    stated that we were directed by the police not to carry banners\r\n    before the White House, not to picket at the White House. That is\r\n    absolutely untrue. We have received only one instruction from the\r\n    chief of police and that was delivered by Major Pullman in person.\r\n    He said that we must not carry banners outside of Headquarters. We\r\n    have had no other communication on this subject since that time.\r\n\r\n    We, of course, realized that that was an extraordinary direction,\r\n    because I don’t think it was ever told an organization that it could\r\n    not propagate its views, and we proceeded naturally to assume that\r\n    Major Pullman would not carry out that order in action because he\r\n    would not be able to sustain it in any just court.\r\n\r\n    We have only been able since to judge instructions by the action of\r\n    the police, and the actions of the police have varied from day to\r\n    day, so that as a point of fact, we don’t know what the police have\r\n    been ordered to do—what is going to be done. On one occasion we\r\n    stepped out of Headquarters with a banner—the so-called Russian\r\n    banner—and it was torn to fragments before we had reached the gate\r\n    of our premises, although Major Pullman had given no notice to us at\r\n    that time. Another time we proceeded down Madison Place with\r\n    banners, walking in front of the Belasco Theatre, and were arrested.\r\n    Another time we were allowed to proceed down Madison Place and the\r\n    north side of the Avenue and were not molested.\r\n\r\n    Now the district attorney has stated that on account of the action\r\n    of this court a few days ago, we knew and deliberately did wrong.\r\n    But we were advised then by the Judge—and he was familiar with the\r\n    first offense—that we would have been all right if we had kept on\r\n    walking. On July 4 we kept on walking and this is the result of that\r\n    action.\r\n\r\n    I myself was informed on June 22 by various police, that if I would\r\n    keep on walking, my action would be entirely legal. We were innocent\r\n    of any desire to do anything wrong when we left our premises.\r\n\r\n    It is evident that the proceedings in this court are had for the\r\n    purpose of suppressing our appeal to the President of the United\r\n    States, and not for the purpose of accusing us of violating the\r\n    police regulations regarding traffic in the District of Columbia.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe eleven women were found “Guilty,” and sentenced to pay a fine of\r\ntwenty-five dollars or to serve three days in the District jail. They\r\nrefused to pay the fine, and were sent to jail. The case against Hazel\r\nHunkins was dismissed. Kitty Marion was found “Not Guilty,” of\r\ndisorderly conduct.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Alice Paul had been seized with what looked like a\r\nsevere illness. A physician finally warned her that she might not live\r\ntwo weeks. It was decided, on July 14, to send her to a hospital in\r\nPhiladelphia for treatment. The day before she left, a meeting of the\r\nExecutive Board was held at her bedside in the Washington hospital.\r\nAlthough later diagnosis proved more favorable, and Miss Paul was to be\r\naway from Washington only a month, many of the women present at that\r\nmeeting believed that they would never see her again. That was a\r\npoignant moment, for the devotion of her adherents to their leader can\r\nneither be described nor measured. But they felt that there was only one\r\nway to serve her if she left them forever and that was to carry out her\r\nplans.... The next day they went out on the picket line.\r\n\r\nThat next day was the French national holiday—July 14. The Woman’s Party\r\nhad, as was usual with them when they planned a demonstration, announced\r\nthis through the press.\r\n\r\nOn the anniversary of the fall of the Bastille, therefore, three groups\r\nof women carrying banners, one inscribed with the French national motto:\r\nLIBERTY, EQUALITY, FRATERNITY, and the Woman’s Party colors, marched one\r\nafter another from Headquarters.\r\n\r\nIn the first group were Mrs. J. A. H. Hopkins, Mrs. Paul Reyneau, Mrs.\r\nB. R. Kincaid, Julia Hurburt, Minnie D. Abbot, Anne Martin.\r\n\r\nIn the second group were, Amelia Himes Walker, Florence Bayard Hilles,\r\nMrs. Gilson Gardner, Janet Fotheringham.\r\n\r\nIn the third group were Mrs. John Winters Brannan, Mrs. John Rogers,\r\nJr., Louise P. Mayo, Doris Stevens, Mary H. Ingham, Eleanor Calnan.\r\n\r\nA big crowd, attracted by the expectation of excitement, had collected\r\noutside Headquarters. The police made no effort to disperse them. When\r\nthe first group appeared, there was some applause and cheering. They\r\ncrossed the street, and took up their station at the upper gate of the\r\nWhite House. As nothing happened to the first group, the second group,\r\nled by Amelia Himes Walker, emerged from Headquarters and took up a\r\nposition at the lower gate of the White House. However, the instant the\r\ntwo groups had established themselves, the policemen, who had been\r\nmaking a pretense of clearing the sidewalks, immediately arrested them.\r\n\r\nThe third group of pickets, however, came forward undismayed, their\r\nflags high. The crowd applauded them; then fell back and permitted the\r\npickets to take their places. The police in this third case waited for\r\nfour minutes, watches in hand. Then they arrested the women on the\r\ncharge of “violating an ordinance.”\r\n\r\nAt the station the sixteen women were booked for “unlawful assembly.” On\r\nJuly 17, Judge Mullowny, sentenced the sixteen women to sixty days in\r\nOccoquan Workhouse on the charge of “obstructing traffic.”\r\n\r\nA detailed consideration of the treatment of the pickets in Occoquan and\r\nthe Jail is reserved for a later chapter. It will, therefore, be stated\r\nbriefly here that these sixteen women were pardoned by the President\r\nafter three days in Occoquan. However, they were submitted to\r\nindignities there such as white prisoners were nowhere else compelled to\r\nendure. When J. A. H. Hopkins and Gilson Gardner were permitted to visit\r\ntheir wives, they did not at first recognize them in the haggard,\r\nexhausted-looking group of creatures in prison garb, sitting in the\r\nreception room. One of the women, however, seeing her husband, half rose\r\nfrom her chair.\r\n\r\n“You sit down!” Superintendent Whittaker yelled, pointing his finger at\r\nher.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJ. A. H. Hopkins, who had been a member of the Democratic National\r\nCampaign Committee of 1916, went immediately to the President and told\r\nhim the conditions under which these women were being held. Gilson\r\nGardner, a well-known newspaper man who had supported Wilson throughout\r\nthe previous election campaign, wrote a long communication to the\r\nPresident on the same subject. Dudley Field Malone, Collector of the\r\nPort of New York and one of the President’s closest friends and warmest\r\nadvisors, who was later in so gallant a way to show his disapproval of\r\nthe Suffrage situation, saw the President also. President Wilson\r\nprofessed himself as being “shocked” at his revelations. He said he did\r\nnot know what was going on at Occoquan.\r\n\r\n“After this, Mr. President,” Mr. Malone replied, “you _do_ know.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter her release, Mrs. J. A. H. Hopkins wanted to find out whether this\r\npardon also meant that the President supported their Amendment. She\r\ntherefore wrote him the following letter:\r\n\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR MR. PRESIDENT:\r\n\r\n    The pardon issued to me by you is accompanied by no explanation. It\r\n    can have but one of two meanings—either you have satisfied yourself,\r\n    as you personally stated to Mr. Hopkins, that I violated no law of\r\n    the country, and no ordinance of this city, in exercising my right\r\n    of peaceful petition, and therefore you, as an act of justice,\r\n    extended to me your pardon, or you pardoned me to save yourself the\r\n    embarrassment of an acute and distressing political situation.\r\n\r\n    In this case, in thus saving yourself, you have deprived me of the\r\n    right through appeal to prove by legal processes that the police\r\n    powers of Washington despotically and falsely convicted me on a\r\n    false charge, in order to save you personal or political\r\n    embarrassment.\r\n\r\n    As you have not seen fit to tell the public the true reason, I am\r\n    compelled to resume my peaceful petition for political liberty. If\r\n    the police arrest me, I shall carry the case to the Supreme Court if\r\n    necessary. If the police do not arrest me, I shall believe that you\r\n    do not believe me guilty. This is the only method by which I can\r\n    release myself from the intolerable and false position in which your\r\n    unexplained pardon has placed me.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Hopkins and I repudiate absolutely the current report that I\r\n    would accept a pardon which was the act of your good nature.\r\n\r\n    In this case, which involves my fundamental constitutional rights,\r\n    Mr. Hopkins and myself do not desire your Presidential benevolence,\r\n    but American justice.\r\n\r\n    Furthermore, we do not believe that you would insult us by extending\r\n    to us your good-nature under these circumstances.\r\n\r\n    This pardon without any explanation of your reasons for its\r\n    issuance, in no way mitigates the injustice inflicted upon me by the\r\n    violation of my constitutional civil right.\r\n\r\n              Respectfully yours,\r\n\r\n                   ALISON TURNBULL HOPKINS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter having written this letter, quite alone and at the crowded hour of\r\nfive o’clock in the afternoon, Mrs. Hopkins carried a banner to the\r\nWhite House gates, and stood there for ten minutes. The banner said: WE\r\nASK NOT PARDON FOR OURSELVES BUT JUSTICE FOR ALL AMERICAN WOMEN. A large\r\nand curious crowd gathered, but nobody bothered her. While she stood\r\nthere, the President passed through the gates and saluted.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn Monday, July 23, exactly a month from the time that the police had\r\nfirst interfered with the picketing and the Suffragists, the daily\r\nSuffrage picket was resumed. The crowds streaming home in the afternoon\r\nfrom the offices, laughed when they saw the banners at the White House\r\ngates again. Some stopped to congratulate the women.\r\n\r\nTime went on and still the President did nothing about putting the\r\nAmendment through. As always when it was not strikingly brought to his\r\nattention, Suffrage seemed to pass from his mind. It became again\r\nnecessary to call his attention to the Amendment. Often it seemed as\r\nthough the President’s attention could be gained only by calling the\r\ncountry’s attention to his inaction.\r\n\r\nWithin a week appeared a new banner. Elihu Root, the Special Envoy of\r\nthe United States to Russia, had just come home from a country which had\r\nenfranchised its women. With the other members of the American Mission\r\nto Russia, he called at the White House, and at the gates he was\r\nconfronted by these words:\r\n\r\n                             TO ENVOY ROOT:\r\n\r\n           YOU SAY THAT AMERICA MUST THROW ITS MANHOOD IN THE\r\n                          SUPPORT OF LIBERTY.\r\n\r\n                             WHOSE LIBERTY?\r\n\r\n          THIS NATION IS NOT FREE. 20,000,000 WOMEN ARE DENIED\r\n           BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES THE RIGHT TO\r\n                REPRESENTATION IN THEIR OWN GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\n            TELL THE PRESIDENT THAT HE CANNOT FIGHT AGAINST\r\n         LIBERTY AT HOME WHILE HE TELLS US TO FIGHT FOR LIBERTY\r\n                                ABROAD.\r\n\r\n           TELL HIM TO MAKE AMERICA FREE FOR DEMOCRACY BEFORE\r\n         HE ASKS THE MOTHERS OF AMERICA TO THROW THEIR SONS TO\r\n                  THE SUPPORT OF DEMOCRACY IN EUROPE.\r\n\r\n            ASK HIM HOW HE COULD REFUSE LIBERTY TO AMERICAN\r\n         CITIZENS WHEN HE HAS FORCED MILLIONS OF AMERICAN BOYS\r\n                OUT OF THEIR COUNTRY TO DIE FOR LIBERTY.\r\n\r\nFor two hours, Lucy Ewing and Mary Winsor stood holding this banner. It\r\nattracted the largest crowd that the pickets had as yet experienced. But\r\nthe police managed them perfectly—although in the courts there had been\r\nplenty of testimony that they could not manage similar crowds—and\r\nwithout a word of protest—although half a block was completely\r\nobstructed for two hours.\r\n\r\nThe following day saw scenes the most violent in the history of the\r\npickets. This was August 14. Catherine Flanagan’s story of this period\r\nof terror is one of the most thrilling in the annals of the Party:\r\n\r\nThat day a new banner was carried for the first time by Elizabeth\r\nStuyvesant—the “Kaiser” banner. The banner read:\r\n\r\n          KAISER WILSON, HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN YOUR SYMPATHY WITH\r\n         THE POOR GERMANS BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT SELF-GOVERNING?\r\n         TWENTY MILLION AMERICAN WOMEN ARE NOT SELF-GOVERNING.\r\n                   TAKE THE BEAM OUT OF YOUR OWN EYE.\r\n\r\nI do not remember when Elizabeth took this banner out, but I think she\r\nwas on the four o’clock shift. For a half an hour people gathered about\r\nthe banner. The crowd grew and grew. You felt there was something\r\nbrewing in them, but what, you could not guess. Suddenly it came—a man\r\ndashed from the crowd and tore the banner down. Immediately, one after\r\nanother, the other banners were torn down. As fast as this happened, the\r\nbanner bearers went back to Headquarters; returned with tri-colors and\r\nreinforcements; took up their stations again. Finally the whole line of\r\npickets, bannerless by this time, marched back to Headquarters. The\r\ncrowd, which was fast changing into a mob, followed us into Madison\r\nPlace. As the pickets emerged again, the mob jumped them at the very\r\ndoors of Cameron House, tore their banners away from them and destroyed\r\nthem. By this time the mob, which had become a solid mass of people,\r\nchoking the street and filling the park, had evolved a leader, a yeoman\r\nin uniform, who incited everybody about him to further work of\r\ndestruction. Suddenly, as if by magic, a ladder appeared in their midst.\r\nA yeoman placed it against Cameron House, and accompanied by a little\r\nboy, he started up. He pulled down the tri-color of the Woman’s Party\r\nwhich hung over the door. In the meantime, it was impossible for us to\r\ntake any banners out. We locked the door, but two strange women, unknown\r\nto the Woman’s Party, came in. They opened a window on the second floor\r\nand were about to push the ladder, on which the sailor and the little\r\nboy still stood, back into the street when Ella Morton Dean drew them\r\naway.\r\n\r\nAt the other side of the house and at the same moment, another member of\r\nthe crowd climbed up the balcony and pulled down the American flag which\r\nhung beside the tri-color. Immediately Virginia Arnold and Lucy Burns\r\nappeared on the balcony carrying, the one the Kaiser banner and the\r\nother the tri-color. The crowd began to throw eggs, tomatoes, and apples\r\nat them, but the two girls stood, Virginia Arnold white, Lucy Burns\r\nflushed, but—everybody who saw them comments on this—with a look of\r\nsteady consecration, absolutely motionless, holding the tri-color which\r\nhad never before been taken from its place over the door at\r\nHeadquarters.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a shot rang out from the crowd. A bullet went through a window\r\nof the second story, directly over the heads of two women who stood\r\nthere—Ella Morton Dean and Georgiana Sturgess—and imbedded itself in the\r\nceiling of the hall. The only man seen to have a revolver was a yeoman\r\nin uniform, who immediately ran up the street. By this time Elizabeth\r\nStuyvesant had joined Lucy Burns and Virginia Arnold on the balcony;\r\nothers also came. Three yeomen climbed up onto the balcony and wrested\r\nthe tri-color banners from the girls. As one of these men climbed over\r\nthe railing, he struck Georgiana Sturgess. “Why did you do that?” she\r\ndemanded, dumbfounded. The man paused a moment, apparently as amazed as\r\nshe. “I don’t know,” he answered; then he tore the banner out of her\r\nhands and descended the ladder. Lucy Burns, whose courage is physical as\r\nwell as spiritual, held her banner until the last moment. It seemed as\r\nthough she were going to be dragged over the railing of the balcony, but\r\ntwo of the yeomen managed to tear it from her hands before this\r\noccurred. New banners were brought to replace those that had\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nWhile this was going on, Katherine Morey and I went out the back way of\r\nHeadquarters, made our way to the White House gates, unfurled a Kaiser\r\nbanner, and stood there for seventeen minutes unnoticed. There was a\r\npoliceman standing beside each of us, but when the yeoman who had led\r\nthe mob and who was apparently about to report for duty, tore at the\r\nbanner, they did not interfere. We were dragged along the pavements, but\r\nthe banner was finally destroyed.\r\n\r\nBy this time the crowd had thinned a little in front of Headquarters.\r\nThe front door had been unlocked when we went back. Five different\r\ntimes, however, we and others, led always by Lucy Burns, made an effort\r\nto bear our banners to the White House gates again. Always, a little\r\ndistance from Headquarters, we were beset by the mob and our banners\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\nAbout five o’clock, the police reserves appeared and cleared the street.\r\nThereupon, every woman who had been on picket duty that day, bearing\r\naloft the beautiful tri-color, went over to the White House gates,\r\nmarched up and down the pavements three times. The police protected us\r\nuntil we started home. When, however, our little procession crossed the\r\nstreet to the park, the crowd leaped upon us again, and again destroyed\r\nour banners. Madeline Watson was knocked down and kicked. Two men\r\ncarried her into Headquarters.\r\n\r\nWhile the crowd was milling its thickest before Headquarters, somebody\r\nsaid to a policeman standing there, “Why don’t you arrest those men?”\r\n“Those are not our orders,” the policeman replied.\r\n\r\nTwenty-two lettered banners and fourteen tri-color flags were destroyed\r\nthat day.\r\n\r\nDuring all the early evening, men were trying to climb over the back\r\nfence of the garden to get into Cameron House. None of us went to bed\r\nthat night. We were afraid that something—we knew not what—might happen.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day, August 15, was only a degree less violent. The Suffrage\r\npickets went on duty as usual at twelve o’clock, and picketed all that\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\nAll the afternoon yeomen, small boys, and hoodlums attacked the women\r\nwithout hindrance. Elizabeth Stuyvesant was struck by a soldier who\r\ndestroyed her flag. Beulah Amidon was thrown down by a sailor, who stole\r\nher flag. Alice Paul was knocked down three times. One sailor dragged\r\nher thirty feet along the White House sidewalk in his attempts to tear\r\noff her Suffrage sash, gashing her neck brutally. They were without\r\nprotection until five o’clock.\r\n\r\nDuring this time they lost fifty tri-color banners and one Kaiser\r\nbanner.\r\n\r\nThe pickets were, of course, constantly going back to Headquarters for\r\nnew banners, and constantly returning with them.\r\n\r\nAt five o’clock, in anticipation of the President’s appearance, and\r\nwhile still the turmoil was going on, five police officers quickly and\r\nefficiently cleared a wide aisle in front of each gate, and as quickly\r\nand as efficiently drove the mob across the street. The President,\r\nhowever, left by a rear gate.\r\n\r\nOn the next day, August 16, the policy toward the pickets changed again.\r\nFifty policemen appeared on the scene, and instead of permitting\r\nSuffragists to be attacked by others, they attacked them themselves.\r\nVirginia Arnold was set upon by three police officers. Before she could\r\nrelinquish her banner to them, her arms were twisted and her hands\r\nbruised. Elizabeth Stuyvesant, Natalie Gray, and Lucy Burns were all\r\nseverely handled by the police. Elizabeth Smith and Ruth Crocker, who\r\nwere carrying furled flags, were knocked down. When men, more\r\nchivalrous-minded than the crowd, came to their rescue, they were\r\narrested.\r\n\r\nIn the late afternoon, the crowd grew denser. The police, therefore,\r\nceased their efforts, and waited while the crowd attacked the women and\r\ndestroyed their banners An officer threatened to arrest one young woman\r\nwho defended her banner against an assailant.\r\n\r\n“Here, give that up!” called the second officer to a girl who was\r\nstruggling with a man for the possession of her flag.\r\n\r\nDuring these days of mob attacks, the pickets had been put to it to get\r\noutside Headquarters to some coign of vantage where they could stand for\r\na few seconds before the inevitable rush. For the first time in the\r\nhistory of their picketing the girls could not carry their banners on\r\npoles. Either the mobs seized them or the policemen who lined the\r\nsidewalks outside Headquarters. The pickets carried them inside their\r\nsweaters and hats, in sewing bags, or pinned them, folded in newspapers\r\nor magazines, under their skirts. One picket was followed by crowds who\r\ncaught a gleam of yellow at the hem of her gown. When they got to the\r\nWhite House, the pickets held the banners in their hands. Lucy Burns\r\nkept sending out relays with new banners to take the place of those\r\nwhich were torn.\r\n\r\nCatherine Flanagan says that on August 16 when the four o’clock shift of\r\nthe picket line started out, Lucy Burns pointed to rolls of banners done\r\nup in various receptacles and said, “Take out as many of these as you\r\ncan carry and keep them concealed until it is necessary to use them.”\r\nThe eight pickets distributed the banners in different parts of their\r\nclothes, and approaching the White House by various routes, suddenly\r\nlined themselves against the White House fence, each unfurling a Kaiser\r\nbanner at the word of command. They were faced by forty policemen,\r\npolicewomen, and secret service men. Instantly the police were on them.\r\nThe pickets held the banners as long as it was physically possible—it\r\ntook three policemen to remove each banner. The policemen heaved sighs\r\nof relief, as though their work for the day was done, turned, and moved\r\nto the edge of the pavement. Instantly, eight more banners appeared and\r\nas instantly they fell on the pickets again. This happened seven times.\r\nAs often as the police turned with captured banners in their hands,\r\nreinforcing pickets in the crowd handed fresh banners to the pickets at\r\nthe gates. Fifty-six Kaiser banners were captured this day. When the\r\nKaiser banners were exhausted, the eight pickets returned to\r\nHeadquarters and soon emerged bearing the tri-color. The tactics of the\r\npolice changed then. They did not, themselves, attack the pickets, but\r\nthey permitted the crowds to do so. In all, one hundred and forty-eight\r\nflags were destroyed.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn August 17, Major Pullman, police head of Washington, called upon\r\nAlice Paul, and warned her that young women carrying banners would be\r\narrested.\r\n\r\nAlice Paul replied, “The picketing will go on as usual.”\r\n\r\nIn a letter to his friend, Major Pullman, quoted in the _Suffragist_ of\r\nAugust 25, Gilson Gardner put the case concisely and decisively....\r\n\r\n\r\n    You must see, Pullman, that you cannot be right in what you have\r\n    done in this matter. You have given the pickets adequate protection;\r\n    you have arrested them and had them sent to jail and the workhouse,\r\n    you have permitted the crowds to mob them, and then you have had\r\n    your officers do much the same thing by forcibly taking their\r\n    banners from them. In some of these actions, you must have been\r\n    wrong. If it was right to give them protection and let them stand at\r\n    the White House for five months, both before and after the war, it\r\n    was not right to do what you did later.\r\n\r\n    You say it was not right and that you were “lenient,” when you gave\r\n    them protection. You cannot mean that. The rightness or wrongness\r\n    must be a matter of law, not of personal discretion, and for you to\r\n    attempt to substitute your discretion is to set up a little\r\n    autocracy in place of the settled laws of the land. That would\r\n    justify a charge of “Kaiserism” right here in our Capitol city.\r\n\r\n    The truth is, Pullman, you were right when you gave these women\r\n    protection. That is what the police are for. When there are riots\r\n    they are supposed to quell them, not by quelling the “proximate\r\n    cause,” but by quelling the rioters.\r\n\r\n    I know your police officers now quite well and I find that they are\r\n    most happy when they are permitted to do their duty. They did not\r\n    like that dirty business of permitting a lot of sailors and street\r\n    riffraff to rough the girls....\r\n\r\n    It is not my opinion alone when I say that the women were entitled\r\n    to police protection, not arrest. President Wilson has stated\r\n    repeatedly that these women were entirely within their legal and\r\n    constitutional rights, and that they should not have been molested.\r\n    Three reputable men, two of them holding office in this\r\n    Administration, have told me what the President said, and I have no\r\n    reason to doubt their word. If the President has changed his mind he\r\n    has not changed the law or the Constitution, and what he said three\r\n    weeks ago is just as true today.\r\n\r\n    In excusing what you have done, you say that the women have carried\r\n    banners with “offensive” inscriptions on them. You refer to the fact\r\n    that they have addressed the President as “Kaiser Wilson.” As a\r\n    matter of fact, not an arrest you have made—and the arrests now\r\n    number more than sixty—has been for carrying one of those\r\n    “offensive” banners. The women were carrying merely the Suffrage\r\n    colors or quotations from President Wilson’s writings.\r\n\r\n    But suppose the banners were offensive? Who made you censor of\r\n    banners? The law gives you no such power. Even when you go through\r\n    the farce of a police court trial, the charge is “obstructing\r\n    traffic,” _which shows conclusively that you are not willing to go\r\n    into court on the real issue_.\r\n\r\n    No. As chief of police you have no more right to complain of the\r\n    sentiments on a banner than you have of the sentiments in an\r\n    editorial in the _Washington Post_, and you have no more right to\r\n    arrest the banner bearers than you have to arrest the owner of the\r\n    _Washington Post_. So long as the law against obscenity and\r\n    profanity is observed, you have no business with the words on the\r\n    banners. Congress refused to pass a press censorship law. There are\r\n    certain lingering traditions to the effect that a people’s\r\n    _liberties are closely bound up with the right to talk things out\r\n    and those who are enlightened know that the only proper answer to\r\n    words is words._\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the entire afternoon of that day—August 17—the day that Major\r\nPullman called on Alice Paul—the sentinels stood at their posts. One of\r\nthe banners read:\r\n\r\n        ENGLAND AND RUSSIA ARE ENFRANCHISING WOMEN IN WAR TIME;\r\n\r\nAnother:\r\n\r\n THE GOVERNMENT ORDERS OUR BANNERS DESTROYED BECAUSE THEY TELL THE TRUTH.\r\n\r\nAt intervals of fifteen minutes—for two hours—the pickets were told by a\r\ncaptain of police that they would be arrested if they did not move. But\r\nthey held their station. At half-past four, the hour at which the\r\nthousand of government clerks invade the streets, there was enough of a\r\ncrowd to give the appearance that the pickets were “blocking traffic.”\r\nLavinia Dock; Edna Dixon; Natalie Gray; Madeline Watson; Catherine\r\nFlanagan; Lucy Ewing, were arrested soon after four o’clock. Their trial\r\nlasted just forty minutes. One police officer testified that they were\r\nobstructing traffic. They all refused to pay the ten-dollar fine, which,\r\nthough it would have released them, would also have been an admission of\r\nguilt, and Police Magistrate Pugh sentenced them to serve thirty days in\r\nthe Government Workhouse.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn August 23, six women appeared at the White House, bearing banners.\r\nThey were, Pauline Adams; Gertrude Hunter; Clara Fuller; Kate Boeckh;\r\nMargaret Fotheringham; Mrs. Henry L. Lockwood. All of their banners\r\nquoted words from the President’s works:\r\n\r\n           I TELL YOU SOLEMNLY, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE CANNOT\r\n               POSTPONE JUSTICE ANY LONGER IN THESE UNITED\r\n\r\n           STATES, AND I DON’T WISH TO SIT DOWN AND LET ANY MAN\r\n          TAKE CARE OF ME WITHOUT MY HAVING AT LEAST A VOICE IN\r\n         IT; AND IF HE DOESN’T LISTEN TO MY ADVICE I AM GOING TO\r\n                 MAKE IT AS UNPLEASANT FOR HIM AS I CAN.\r\n\r\nIn ten minutes they were all arrested. When they appeared before Police\r\nMagistrate Pugh, Clara Kinsley Fuller said in part:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I am the editor, owner, and publisher of a daily and weekly\r\n    newspaper in Minnesota. I pay taxes to this government, yet I have\r\n    nothing to say in the making of those laws which control me, either\r\n    as an individual or as a business woman. Taxation without\r\n    representation is undemocratic. For that reason, I came to\r\n    Washington to help the Federal Amendment fight. When I learned that\r\n    President Wilson said that picketing was perfectly legal, I went on\r\n    the picket line and did my bit towards making democracy safe at\r\n    home, while our men are abroad making democracy safe for the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nMargaret Fotheringham, a school-teacher, said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I have fifteen British cousins who are in the fighting line abroad.\r\n    Some are back very badly wounded, and others are still in France. I\r\n    have two brothers who are to be in our fighting line. They were not\r\n    drafted; they enlisted. I am made of the same stuff that those boys\r\n    are made of; and, whether it is abroad or at home, we are fighting\r\n    for the same thing. We are fighting for the thing we hold nearest\r\n    our hearts—for democracy.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo these pleas, Judge Pugh answered that the President was “not the one\r\nto petition for justice”; that the people of the District virtuously\r\nrefrained from picketing the White House for the vote for themselves\r\n“for fear the military would take possession of the streets.”\r\n\r\nI quote the _Suffragist_ of September 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Here is a sample of Judge Pugh’s logic:\r\n\r\n    “These ladies have been told repeatedly that this law was ample to\r\n    prevent picketing in front of the White House, or anywhere else on\r\n    the sidewalks of the District of Columbia; that it was not the\r\n    fashion to petition Congress in that way, to stand in front of the\r\n    White House, the President’s mansion, to petition somebody else, a\r\n    mile and a half away. The President does not have to be\r\n    petitioned.... You ladies observe all the laws that give you\r\n    benefits, property rights that legislatures composed of men have\r\n    passed ... and those that are aimed at preserving the peace and good\r\n    order of the community you do not propose to observe.”\r\n\r\n    And much more to the same effect, which proved that Judge Pugh knew\r\n    nothing of the long vigil of the pickets at the doors of Congress,\r\n    and apparently nothing of the President’s actual dictatorship.\r\n\r\n    Finally he admitted that he did not care to send “ladies of\r\n    standing” to jail, and would refrain if they promised to stop\r\n    picketing, although they were not charged with picketing. In the\r\n    face of the dead silence that followed, he pronounced sentence: A\r\n    fine of twenty-five dollars or thirty days at Occoquan Workhouse.\r\n    Every woman refused to pay the fine.\r\n\r\n    Attorney Matthew O’Brien represented the women in the District\r\n    Court, appealing finally from the judgment of the court.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn August 28, the same women, with Cornelia Beach, Vivian Pierce, Maud\r\nJamison, and Lucy Burns, were again arrested, and given the same\r\nsentence. An appeal was granted them again, the Judge announcing that\r\nthis was the last appeal he would give in the picketing cases until a\r\ndecision had been given by the Court of Appeals.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn September 4, the day of the parade of the drafted men, thirteen women\r\nwere arrested. They were: Abby Scott Baker, Dorothy Bartlett, Annie\r\nArniel, Pauline Adams, Mrs. W. W. Chisholm, Lucy Burns, Margaret\r\nFotheringham, Lucy Branham, Julia Emory, Eleanor Calnan, Edith Ainge,\r\nMaude Malone, Mary Winsor.\r\n\r\nThe banner these women bore was inscribed:\r\n\r\n          MR. PRESIDENT, HOW LONG MUST WOMEN BE DENIED A VOICE\r\n           IN THE GOVERNMENT THAT IS CONSCRIPTING THEIR SONS?\r\n\r\nThey were sent to Occoquan for sixty days.\r\n\r\nAt this vivid interval in the history of the Woman’s Party occurred a\r\nnotable incident.\r\n\r\nDudley Field Malone, who had long been a staunch friend of the Woman’s\r\nParty—and one of the few men who had been willing to make a sacrifice\r\nfor Suffrage—resigned his position as Collector of the Port of New York\r\nas a protest against the intolerable Suffrage situation. This was a\r\n_beau geste_ on the part of Mr. Malone. There are those who believe that\r\nthat gallant deed will go rolling down the centuries gathering luster as\r\nit rolls. It had an inevitable effect, not only on the members of the\r\nWoman’s Party, but on the members of other Suffrage organizations as\r\nwell, and it produced a profound impression on the country at large.\r\n\r\nHis letter of resignation reads as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                         NEW YORK, N. Y., Sept. 7, 1917.\r\n\r\n    THE PRESIDENT,\r\n\r\n         THE WHITE HOUSE,\r\n\r\n              WASHINGTON, D. C.\r\n\r\n    DEAR MR. PRESIDENT:\r\n\r\n    Last autumn, as the representative of your Administration, I went\r\n    into the Woman Suffrage States to urge your re-election. The most\r\n    difficult argument to meet among the seven million voters was the\r\n    failure of the Democratic Party, throughout four years of power, to\r\n    pass the Federal Suffrage Amendment, looking towards the\r\n    enfranchisement of all the women in the country. Throughout those\r\n    States, and particularly in California, which ultimately decided the\r\n    election by the votes of women, the women voters were urged to\r\n    support you, even though Judge Hughes had already declared for the\r\n    Federal Suffrage Amendment, because you and your Party, through\r\n    liberal leadership, were more likely nationally to enfranchise the\r\n    rest of the women of the country than were your opponents.\r\n\r\n    And if the women of the West voted to re-elect you, I promised them\r\n    I would spend all my energy, at any sacrifice to myself, to get the\r\n    present Democratic Administration to pass the Federal Suffrage\r\n    Amendment.\r\n\r\n    But the present policy of the Administration, in permitting splendid\r\n    American women to be sent to jail in Washington, not for carrying\r\n    offensive banners, nor for picketing, but on the technical charge of\r\n    obstructing traffic, is a denial even of their constitutional right\r\n    to petition for, and demand the passage of, the Federal Suffrage\r\n    Amendment. It, therefore, now becomes my profound obligation\r\n    actively to keep my promise to the women of the West.\r\n\r\n    In more than twenty States it is a practical impossibility to amend\r\n    the State constitutions; so the women of those States can only be\r\n    enfranchised by the passage of the Federal Suffrage Amendment. Since\r\n    England and Russia, in the midst of the great war, have assured the\r\n    national enfranchisement of their women, should we not be jealous to\r\n    maintain our democratic leadership in the world by the speedy\r\n    national enfranchisement of American women?\r\n\r\n    To me, Mr. President, as I urged upon you in Washington two months\r\n    ago, this is not only a measure of justice and democracy, it is also\r\n    an urgent war measure. The women of the nation are, and always will\r\n    be, loyal to the country, and the passage of the Suffrage Amendment\r\n    is only the first step toward their national emancipation. But\r\n    unless the government takes at least this first step toward their\r\n    enfranchisement, how can the government ask millions of American\r\n    women, educated in our schools and colleges, and millions of\r\n    American women in our homes, or toiling for economic independence in\r\n    every line of industry, to give up by conscription their men and\r\n    happiness to a war for democracy in Europe while these women\r\n    citizens are denied the right to vote on the policies of the\r\n    government which demands of them such sacrifice?\r\n\r\n    For this reason many of your most ardent friends and supporters feel\r\n    that the passage of the Federal Suffrage Amendment is a war measure\r\n    which could appropriately be urged by you at this session of\r\n    Congress. It is true that this Amendment would have to come from\r\n    Congress, but the present Congress shows no earnest desire to enact\r\n    this legislation for the simple reason that you, as the leader of\r\n    the Party in power, have not yet suggested it.\r\n\r\n    For the whole country gladly acknowledges, Mr. President, that no\r\n    vital piece of legislation has come through Congress these five\r\n    years except by your extraordinary and brilliant leadership. And\r\n    millions of men and women today hope that you will give the Federal\r\n    Suffrage Amendment to the women of the country by the valor of your\r\n    leadership now. It will hearten the mothers of the nation, eliminate\r\n    a just grievance, and turn the devoted energies of brilliant women\r\n    to a more hearty support of the government in this crisis.\r\n\r\n    As you well know, in dozens of speeches in many States I have\r\n    advocated your policies and the war. I was the first man of your\r\n    Administration, nearly five years ago, publicly to advocate\r\n    preparedness, and helped to found the first Plattsburg training\r\n    camp. And if, with our troops mobilizing in France, you will give\r\n    American women this measure for their political freedom, they will\r\n    support with greater enthusiasm your hope and the hope of America\r\n    for world freedom.\r\n\r\n    I have not approved all the methods recently adopted by women in the\r\n    pursuit of their political liberty; yet, Mr. President, the\r\n    Committee on Suffrage of the United States Senate was formed in\r\n    1883, when I was one year old; this same Federal Suffrage Amendment\r\n    was first introduced in Congress in 1878; brave women like Susan B.\r\n    Anthony were petitioning Congress for the Suffrage before the Civil\r\n    War, and at the time of the Civil War men like William Lloyd\r\n    Garrison, Horace Greeley, and Wendell Phillips assured the Suffrage\r\n    leaders that if they abandoned their fight for Suffrage, when the\r\n    war was ended the men of the nation, “out of gratitude,” would\r\n    enfranchise the women of the country!\r\n\r\n    And if the men of this country had been peacefully demanding for\r\n    over half a century the political right or privilege to vote, and\r\n    had been continuously ignored or met with evasion by successive\r\n    Congresses, as have the women, you, Mr. President, as a lover of\r\n    liberty, would be the first to comprehend and forgive their\r\n    inevitable impatience and righteous indignation. Will not this\r\n    Administration, re-elected to power by the hope and faith of the\r\n    women of the West, handsomely reward that faith by taking action now\r\n    for the passage of the Federal Suffrage Amendment?\r\n\r\n    In the port of New York, during the last four years, billions of\r\n    dollars in the export and import trade of the country have been\r\n    handled by the men of the customs service; their treatment of the\r\n    traveling public has radically changed, their vigilance supplied the\r\n    evidence for the Lusitania note; the neutrality was rigidly\r\n    maintained; the great German fleet guarded, captured, and repaired;\r\n    substantial economies and reforms have been concluded, and my ardent\r\n    industry has been given to this great office of your appointment.\r\n    But now I wish to leave these finished tasks, to return to my\r\n    profession of the law, and to give all my leisure time to fight as\r\n    hard for the political freedom of women as I have always fought for\r\n    your liberal leadership.\r\n\r\n    It seems a long seven years, Mr. President, since I first campaigned\r\n    with you when you were running for Governor of New Jersey. In every\r\n    circumstance throughout those years, I have served you with the most\r\n    respectful affection and unshadowed devotion. It is no small\r\n    sacrifice now for me, as a member of your Administration, to sever\r\n    our political relationship. But I think it is high time that men in\r\n    this generation, at some cost to themselves, stood up to battle for\r\n    the national enfranchisement of American women. So in order\r\n    effectively to keep my promise made in the West, and more freely to\r\n    go into this larger field of democratic effort, I hereby resign my\r\n    office as Collector of the Port of New York, to take effect at once,\r\n    or at your earliest convenience.\r\n\r\n              Yours respectfully,\r\n\r\n                   DUDLEY FIELD MALONE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn September 13, six pickets left Headquarters at half-past four in the\r\nafternoon. They were: Katherine Fisher, Mrs. Frederick Willard Kendall,\r\nMrs. Mark Jackson, Ruth Crocker, Nina Samardin, Eleanor Gwinter. The two\r\nlettered banners were borne by Miss Fisher and Mrs. Kendall:\r\n\r\n                 HOW LONG MUST WOMEN WAIT FOR LIBERTY?\r\n\r\n          MR. PRESIDENT, WHAT WILL YOU DO FOR WOMAN SUFFRAGE?\r\n\r\nThey marched straight to the lower gate. A crowd had already collected\r\nthere. Another crowd lined the edge of the sidewalk across the street on\r\nLafayette Square. There were two police officers on the White House\r\nsidewalk, and several across the way.\r\n\r\nThe crowd made way for the group of pickets, and they took their\r\naccustomed places at the gate. For a few minutes nothing happened.\r\nDuring all these days of roughness and riot, it had been very difficult\r\nto take pictures. It seemed as though the thing the police most feared\r\nwas the truth. They would not permit the moving-picture men to record\r\nthese vivid events. They even confiscated cameras. Photographers ran the\r\nrisk always of having their cameras destroyed. On this day, Gladys\r\nGreiner, a Suffragist, was taking pictures of the crowd. As she leveled\r\nher kodak at a police captain, he kicked her. She continued to take her\r\npictures nevertheless. A sailor and a marine, both in uniform, instead\r\nof moving as the police had ordered, came closer and closer to the\r\npickets. Suddenly, the sailor snatched the banner from the pole. The two\r\nmen tore the banner into pieces; passed the scraps to their friends. The\r\npolice looked on without interference. Then they arrested the women.\r\nThey were taken to Judge Mullowny.\r\n\r\nJudge Mullowny had been away for two months from the bench. In the\r\nmeantime, his ideas on the offense of picketing had undergone another\r\nchange. His first decision in regard to the Suffragists was that they\r\nobstructed traffic, and, in regard to the banners, that they “had\r\nnothing to do with the case.” Later, he decided that the banners were\r\n“treasonable.” Now, in regard to their banner, _How Long Must Women Wait\r\nfor Liberty?_, he decided: “Since this banner is unlikely to give\r\noffense, I will give you women a light sentence this time.”\r\n\r\nAll evidence except that of the two policemen was ruled out. In regard\r\nto the conduct of the police captain in kicking Miss Greiner, the Judge\r\nsaid: “I have nothing to do with those things; they have nothing to do\r\nwith the case.”\r\n\r\nHe asked, “Would you pay a fine instead of going to prison, if I made\r\nthe fine fifty cents?”\r\n\r\n“Not if you made it five cents,” replied Mrs. Kendall, who spoke for the\r\nsix prisoners.\r\n\r\nHe therefore sentenced them to thirty days in the government workhouse.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn September 22, four more Suffragists were arrested. They were Peggy\r\nBaird Johns, Margaret Wood Kessler, Ernestine Hara, Hilda Blumberg. They\r\ncarried a new banner this time, quoting words from an early work of the\r\nPresident. It said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    PRESIDENT WILSON, WHAT DID YOU MEAN WHEN YOU SAID, “WE HAVE SEEN A\r\n    GOOD MANY SINGULAR THINGS HAPPEN RECENTLY. WE HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT IT\r\n    IS UNPATRIOTIC TO CRITICIZE PUBLIC ACTION. WELL, IF IT IS, THERE IS\r\n    A DEEP DISGRACE RESTING UPON THE ORIGIN OF THIS NATION. THIS NATION\r\n    ORIGINATED IN THE SHARPEST SORT OF CRITICISM OF PUBLIC POLICY. WE\r\n    ORIGINATED, TO PUT IT IN THE VERNACULAR, IN A KICK AND IF IT IS\r\n    UNPATRIOTIC TO KICK, WHY, THEN THE GROWN MAN IS UNLIKE THE CHILD. WE\r\n    HAVE FORGOTTEN THE VERY PRINCIPLE OF OUR ORIGIN IF WE HAVE FORGOTTEN\r\n    HOW TO OBJECT, HOW TO RESIST, HOW TO AGITATE, HOW TO PULL DOWN AND\r\n    BUILD UP EVEN TO THE EXTENT OF REVOLUTIONARY PRACTICES IF IT BE\r\n    NECESSARY TO READJUST MATTERS. I HAVE FORGOTTEN MY HISTORY IF THAT\r\n    BE NOT TRUE HISTORY.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Suffragist_ of September 29 describes this event:\r\n\r\n\r\n    When the pickets this week took up their stations at the East gate\r\n    of the White House, and unfurled the “seditious” utterance of the\r\n    President himself, the banner was almost immediately confiscated by\r\n    the two police officers who had hurried to the spot. They seemed\r\n    anxious to keep from the little pressing crowd the fact that the\r\n    President had once been not only a Democrat, but a democrat.\r\n\r\n    The two officers then stood directly in front of the little group of\r\n    women carrying tri-colored flags, with their backs to what crowd\r\n    there was. More than half of the wide White House sidewalks were\r\n    vacant of pedestrians. The officers had evidently been ordered to\r\n    let the crowd collect for a certain number of minutes before they\r\n    arrested the women. They betrayed not the slightest interest in the\r\n    spectators, but watched their victims with bored attention as they\r\n    waited for the patrol....\r\n\r\n    The four young women were, on the following day, after the usual\r\n    court proceeding, sentenced to thirty days in the government\r\n    workhouse for “obstructing traffic.”\r\n\r\n    A brief statement was made by each of the little group. “We are not\r\n    citizens,” said these young women. “We are not represented. We were\r\n    silently, peacefully attempting to gain the freedom of twenty\r\n    million women in the United States of America. We have broken no\r\n    law. We are guilty of no crime. We have been illegally arrested. We\r\n    demand our freedom, and we shall continue to ask for it until the\r\n    government acts.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThey were given thirty days in the workhouse.\r\n\r\nThe last picketing of the Emergency War Session of the Sixty-fifth\r\nCongress took place on October 6, the day Congress adjourned. There were\r\neleven women in this picket line: Dr. Caroline Spencer, Vivian Pierce,\r\nLouise Lewis Kahle, Rose Winslow, Joy Young, Matilda Young, Minnie\r\nHenesy, Kate Heffelfinger, Maud Jamison, Lou C. Daniels.\r\n\r\nAlice Paul led them. Congress was adjourning. The work of the Woman’s\r\nParty was going on smoothly. For the first time, Alice Paul felt that\r\nshe had the leisure to go to jail.\r\n\r\nIn the _Suffragist_ of October 13, Pauline Jacobson of the _San\r\nFrancisco Bulletin_ thus describes their arrest:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I had had much of the Western prejudice against the “militant\r\n    movement” that the live Suffrage battle had become in this country.\r\n    I had thought from the newspaper reports that have gone forth\r\n    concerning the action of these “militant Suffragists,” that\r\n    “picketing” was rowdy and unlovely. I found it a silent, a still\r\n    thing—a thing sublime....\r\n\r\n    The sun, which never seems bright to me under these paler Eastern\r\n    skies, slanted chill and thin through the falling golden foliage of\r\n    autumn trees lining the broad avenue on which the White House\r\n    stands. Diagonally across, flying the Suffrage colors, stands the\r\n    handsome old Cameron House, the Headquarters of the Woman’s Party.\r\n\r\n    Suddenly that chill avenue vista became vibrant with color, with\r\n    fluttering banners, wide-striped of purple, white, and gold, borne\r\n    aloft on tall, imposing, war-like spears. Down the Avenue they\r\n    fluttered slowly, as if moved by some mysterious force. Then I saw\r\n    the force that was sending those banners forward through the\r\n    careless crowds.\r\n\r\n    There were eleven women, each bearing high her colored banner. The\r\n    leader, a woman frail, and slight, and very pale, her eyes and face\r\n    really lit with exaltation of purpose, carried a white flag on which\r\n    was printed: “Mr. President, what will you do for Woman Suffrage?”\r\n    Then behind them followed the others with the vivid purple and gold\r\n    flags on the spear-headed staffs. They looked neither to the right\r\n    nor to the left. They seemed to me to walk so lightly that the great\r\n    banners carried them; and there was the glow in all of their eyes\r\n    though their faces were quite unsmiling.\r\n\r\n    The street in an instant had become alive with people who gathered\r\n    about, followed, or lined the curbs, men and women—the women for the\r\n    most part curious, the men for the most part disdainful, insolent,\r\n    or leering. It was not a Western crowd; there was no generosity in\r\n    it.\r\n\r\n    But silently, perceived by all but perceiving none, the women\r\n    marched straight ahead. As they neared the White House a sailor\r\n    sprang forward and tore the banner from one picket, threw it on the\r\n    ground, and trampled on it. The young girl who had carried it\r\n    stooped down and silently rescued her banner. I thought there was\r\n    tenderness in the way she smoothed it out and tried to fasten it\r\n    again to her tall staff. Four banners were torn and mutilated like\r\n    that. Each girl, without a word, like the first, tried to protect\r\n    her flag.\r\n\r\n    And then, like a flash, those eleven women, a few feet apart, were\r\n    flanking either side of the wide White House gates like living\r\n    statues, only their colored banners fluttering upward. They stood\r\n    facing the coming and going crowd silently. There was the pale\r\n    little leader with her staff bare; the crowd had torn away that\r\n    simple question on the white flag....\r\n\r\n    Then came shouted orders, the sudden waving of blue-coated arms, and\r\n    the elbowing to the front of blue coats with much gold braid. The\r\n    police were scattering the curious crowd. Above their orders came\r\n    the clang of the patrol. Next the eleven statues had disappeared\r\n    from the White House gates. They were being crowded to the front by\r\n    the fat officer in the uniform. They were still silent and still\r\n    proud. There was something majestic even in the way each stooped her\r\n    head to enter the small door of the patrol wagon. And the last\r\n    uniformed officer who had gathered together the brilliant flags sat\r\n    in front, where they still fluttered triumphant in the wind as the\r\n    patrol clanged off and the crowd shouted.\r\n\r\n    I followed them to the police station. It seemed to me there was\r\n    strange delay in the procedure of accepting bail for people charged\r\n    with so simple an offense—for they were charged with “obstructing\r\n    traffic.” That same day, I had seen dense crowds watching the World\r\n    Series returns, with mounted police to clear a space for the cars.\r\n    There were no arrests for blocking traffic. They were finally\r\n    released on bail for trial the following Monday.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe eleven women were tried on October 8. They refused to recognize the\r\nCourt. They would not be sworn. They would not question witnesses. They\r\nwould not speak in their own behalf.\r\n\r\nAlice Paul said—I quote the _Suffragist_:\r\n\r\n\r\n    We do not wish to make any plea before this Court. We do not\r\n    consider ourselves subject to this Court since, as an unenfranchised\r\n    class, we have nothing to do with the making of the laws which have\r\n    put us in this position.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Judge did not sentence the eleven women. He suspended sentence and\r\nrestored the bail furnished by the Suffragists for their appearance. For\r\nthis surprising change of front, no reason was given. Though apparently\r\ninconsistent, it was perfectly consistent with the policy of an\r\nAdministration quite dazed and uncertain in regard to its treatment of\r\nthe picketing women.\r\n\r\nIn point of fact, the Court did not sentence the women because Congress\r\nwas adjourning. They did not dismiss the charge, however.\r\n\r\nRegarding the freeing of the pickets Miss Paul said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    We are glad that the authorities have retreated at last from their\r\n    untenable position, and grown wary of prosecuting women for\r\n    peacefully petitioning for political liberty.\r\n\r\n    The action of the Court this morning makes more glaring than ever\r\n    the injustice of holding nineteen women on sixty and thirty day\r\n    sentences in Occoquan Workhouse for the same offense of petitioning\r\n    for liberty which we committed. We will use our unexpected freedom\r\n    to press our campaign with ever-increasing vigor.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn October 15, four pickets, under suspended sentence from their\r\npicketing of October 6, went out again. They were Rose Winslow, Kate\r\nHeffelfinger, Minnie Henesy, Maud Jamison. The police were taken\r\nabsolutely by surprise. It was ten minutes before the patrol wagons\r\nappeared. In the meantime, of course, a crowd gathered to see what was\r\ngoing to happen. When the patrol stopped at the curb, an officer\r\napproached the pickets. “Move on!” he ordered, and, before the pickets\r\ncould move on, or even make a reply—“I will put you under arrest,” and\r\nimmediately, “You are under arrest.” Rose Winslow, one of the pickets,\r\nlifted her banner high, and marched with the air of a conqueror to the\r\nwaiting patrol. The crowd burst into spontaneous applause.\r\n\r\nIn court Rose Winslow said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    We have seen officers of the law permit men to assault women, to\r\n    destroy their banners, to enter their residences. How, then, can you\r\n    ask us to have respect for the law? We thought that by dismissing\r\n    the Suffragists without sentence this Court had finally decided to\r\n    recognize our legal right to petition the government. We shall\r\n    continue to picket because it is our right. On the tenth of November\r\n    there will be a long line of Suffragists who will march to the White\r\n    House gates to ask for political liberty. You can send us to jail,\r\n    but you know that we have broken no law. You know that we have not\r\n    even committed the technical offense on which we were arrested. You\r\n    know that we are guiltless.\r\n\r\n\r\nJudge Mullowny gave them the choice between a twenty-five dollar fine\r\nand six months in the district workhouse. They, of course, refused to\r\npay the fine.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt half-past four on October 20, Alice Paul led a deputation of three\r\npickets to the West gate of the White House. The others were Dr.\r\nCaroline Spencer, Gladys Greiner, Gertrude Crocker. Alice Paul carried a\r\nbanner with the words of President Wilson which had appeared recently on\r\nthe posters for the Second Liberty Bond Loan of 1917:\r\n\r\n          THE TIME HAS COME TO CONQUER OR SUBMIT. FOR US THERE\r\n                CAN BE BUT ONE CHOICE. WE HAVE MADE IT.\r\n\r\nDr. Caroline Spencer’s banner bore the watchword of ’76:\r\n\r\n               RESISTANCE TO TYRANNY IS OBEDIENCE TO GOD.\r\n\r\nThey were arrested as soon as the police had permitted what seemed a\r\nsufficient crowd to gather, placed in the patrol wagon, and taken to the\r\ndistrict jail.\r\n\r\nThe officer testified as follows—the italics are my own:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I made my way through the crowd that was surrounding them, and told\r\n    the ladies _they were violating the law by standing at the gates_,\r\n    and would not they please move on.\r\n\r\n    Assistant District Attorney Hart asked: Did they move on?\r\n\r\n    Lee answered: _They did not, and they did not answer either._\r\n\r\n    Hart: What did you do then?\r\n\r\n    Lee: Placed them under arrest.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe two women who carried the banners—Alice Paul and Caroline\r\nSpencer—were sentenced to seven months in jail; the other two pickets\r\nwere offered the choice of a five dollar fine or thirty days, and, of\r\ncourse, took the thirty days.\r\n\r\nOn the same occasion, Rose Winslow and those who were arrested with her,\r\nMaud Jamison, Kate Heffelfinger, Minnie Henesy—both on October 4 and\r\nOctober 15—came up for further sentence. Rose Winslow described very\r\nvigorously the confusion of the Suffragists who, she admitted, were not\r\nmore nonplussed than Judge Mullowny admitted the Court was. She said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    You sentence us to jail for a few days, then you sentence us to the\r\n    workhouse for thirty days, then sixty, and then you suspend\r\n    sentence. Sometimes we are accused of carrying seditious banners,\r\n    then of obstructing traffic. How do you expect us to see any\r\n    consistency in the law, or in your sentences?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Court smiled, and pronounced an additional thirty days, saying:\r\n“First, you will serve six months, and then you will serve one month\r\nmore.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAlice Paul had been in jail ever since October 20. When the news first\r\ngot out, women came from all over the country to join the picket forces.\r\nIt was decided that on November 10, forty-one women should go out on the\r\npicket line as a protest against her imprisonment. But on the night of\r\nNovember 9, these forty-one women—accompanied by sympathizers and\r\nfriends—went down to the jail where their leader was confined.\r\nHeadquarters had heard from Alice Paul from time to time, and Alice Paul\r\nhad heard from Headquarters—by means of a cleaning-woman in the jail. In\r\nher _Jailed for Freedom_, Doris Stevens tells how she went down to the\r\njail and talked to Alice Paul from the yard. Catherine Flanagan and Mrs.\r\nSophie Meredith had communicated with her in this same manner. And once\r\nVida Milholland came and sang under her window. But this was the first\r\ntime that a deputation visited their imprisoned leader.\r\n\r\nThe house in which Warden Zinkham lived was close to the wing in which\r\nAlice Paul was imprisoned. The leader of the delegation, Katherine\r\nMorey, accompanied by Catherine Flanagan, went to Zinkham’s door and\r\nrang the bell; asked to see him. They were told that he was ill and\r\ncould not be seen. Immediately, the two girls gave a prearranged signal\r\nto the silent crowd of pickets back of them. With one accord, they ran\r\nand grouped themselves under Alice Paul’s window. Before the guards\r\ncould rush upon them and push them out of the yard, they had managed to\r\ncall up to her their names; the large sum of money which that day had\r\ncome into the Treasury; that forty-one of them would protest against her\r\nimprisonment on the picket line the next day.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe next morning, the picket line of forty-one women marched from\r\nHeadquarters in five groups. The first was led by Mrs. John Winters\r\nBrannan.\r\n\r\nAs usual, the pickets bore golden-lettered banners. As usual, they bore\r\npurple, white, and gold flags. As usual, they walked slowly—always a\r\nbanner’s length apart. They moved over to Pennsylvania Avenue; took up\r\ntheir silent statuesque position at the East and West gates of the White\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\nThe thick stream of government clerks, hastening with home-going\r\nswiftness, paused to look at them. Involuntarily they applauded the\r\nwomen when they were arrested. This happened almost immediately, the\r\npolice hurrying the pickets into the line of waiting patrols. Suddenly\r\nthe crowd raised a shout:\r\n\r\n“There come some more!”\r\n\r\nThe second picket line numbered ten women.\r\n\r\nThey also bore golden lettered banners. They also bore flags of purple,\r\nwhite, and gold. They were arrested immediately.\r\n\r\nThe applause continued to grow and grow in volume.\r\n\r\nImmediately a third group appeared, and after they had been arrested, a\r\nfourth; and, on their arrest, a fifth. For half an hour a continuous\r\nline of purple, white, and gold blazed its revolutionary path through\r\nthe grayness of the November afternoon.\r\n\r\nMary A. Nolan of Florida headed the fifth group of pickets. Little,\r\nfrail, lame, seventy years old, her gallantry elicited from the two\r\nlines of onlookers applause, cheers, calls of encouragement.\r\n\r\n“Keep right on!” one voice emerged from the noise. “You’ll make them\r\ngive it to you!”\r\n\r\nThe women of the first group were: Mrs. John Winters Brannan, Belle\r\nSheinberg, L. H. Hornesby, Paula Jakobi, Cynthia Cohen, M. Tilden\r\nBurritt, Dorothy Day, Mrs. Henry Butterworth, Cora Weeks, Peggy Baird\r\nJohns, Elizabeth Hamilton, Ella Guilford, Amy Juengling, Hattie Kruger.\r\n\r\nThe women of the second group were: Agnes H. Morey, Mrs. William Bergen,\r\nCamilla Whitcomb, Ella Findeisen, Lou Daniels, Mrs. George Scott, Mrs.\r\nLawrence Lewis, Elizabeth McShane, Kathryn Lincoln.\r\n\r\nThe women of the third group were: Mrs. William Kent, Alice Gram, Betty\r\nGram, Mrs. R. B. Quay, Mrs. C. T. Robertson, Eva Decker, Genevieve\r\nWilliams.\r\n\r\nThe women of the fourth group were: Mrs. Charles W. Barnes, Kate\r\nStafford, Mrs. J. H. Short, Mrs. A. N. Beim, Catherine Martinette.\r\n\r\nThe women of the fifth group were: Mrs. Harvey Wiley, Alice Cosu, Mary\r\nBartlett Dixon, Julia Emory, Mary A. Nolan, Lucy Burns.\r\n\r\nThe forty-one women were tried on November 12. They were charged with\r\n“obstructing traffic,” and pleaded “Not Guilty.” The police sergeants\r\nand plain-clothes men gave their testimony which was refuted absolutely\r\nby witnesses for the defendants—Helena Hill Weed, Olivia Dunbar\r\nTorrence, Marie Manning Gasch, Mary Ingham.\r\n\r\nMrs. John Winters Brannan said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The responsibility for an agitation like ours against injustice\r\n    rests with those who deny justice, not those who demand it. Whatever\r\n    may be the verdict of this Court, we shall continue our agitation\r\n    until the grievance of American women is redressed.\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Harvey Wiley said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I want to state that we took this action with great consecration of\r\n    spirit. We took this action with willingness to sacrifice our\r\n    personal liberty in order to focus the attention of the nation on\r\n    the injustice of our disfranchisement, that we might thereby win\r\n    political liberty for all the women of the country. The Constitution\r\n    says that Congress shall not in any way abridge the right of\r\n    citizens peacefully to assembly and petition. That is exactly what\r\n    we did. We peacefully assembled and then proceeded with our petition\r\n    to the President for the redress of our grievance of\r\n    disfranchisement. The Constitution does not specify the form of\r\n    petition. Ours was in the form of a banner. To say that we “broke\r\n    traffic regulations” when we exercised our constitutional right of\r\n    petition is therefore unconstitutional.\r\n\r\n\r\nJudge Mullowny admitted the embarrassment of the Administration.\r\n\r\n“The trouble of the situation is that the Court has not been given power\r\nto meet it,” he complained. “It is very, very puzzling.”\r\n\r\nA little after three o’clock, he dismissed the pickets without imposing\r\nsentence. He said he would take the case under advisement.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn hour later, twenty-seven of the women who had just been tried—with,\r\nin addition, Mrs. William L. Colt, Elizabeth Smith, Matilda Young, Hilda\r\nBlumberg—emerged from Headquarters. They walked twice up and down in\r\nfront of the White House before they took their places at the gates.\r\n\r\nThe police were dumbfounded by their unexpected onslaught. There were no\r\npatrols waiting. But they pulled themselves together, arrested the\r\npickets, and commandeered cars in which to take them to the police\r\nheadquarters.\r\n\r\nThe thirty-one women were ordered to appear in court on November 14.\r\nThere, after waiting all the morning, Judge Mullowny told them to come\r\nback Friday.\r\n\r\nAt Headquarters, it was believed that this was not only a challenge to\r\nthe quality of their spirit, but to the degree of their patience.\r\n\r\nMany women had come from a long distance to make this protest. Not all\r\ncould spare the time, money, and vitality. Their answer to that\r\nchallenge was instant and convincing. On the afternoon of November 13,\r\nthe picket line went out again—thirty-one of them.\r\n\r\nThe pickets blazed their way through dense, black throngs. The crowd was\r\ndistinctly friendly.\r\n\r\nSuddenly one of the banners disappeared; another and another until six\r\nof them were destroyed; the bare poles proceeded on their way however.\r\nThe same person accomplished all this—the uniformed yeoman who dragged\r\nAlice Paul across thirty feet of pavement on August 15. But this time,\r\nthe crowd—friendly—manifested its disapproval, and the police arrested\r\nhim. The pickets stood for a long time, their line stretching from gate\r\nto gate, until they began to think that the Administration had changed\r\nits tactics. Then suddenly the patrol wagon gong sounded in the\r\ndistance. Presently they were all arrested.\r\n\r\nMany of the pickets had been tried the day before. As their bail had not\r\nbeen refunded, they refused to give more. They were kept that night in\r\nthe house of detention. As this institution had but two rooms with eight\r\nbeds each, some of the women slept on the floor. They were tried and\r\nsentenced the next day. One of them—the aged Mrs. Nolan—got six days,\r\nthree fifteen days, twenty-four thirty days, two—Mrs. Lawrence Lewis and\r\nMrs. John Winters Brannan—sixty days, and one—Lucy Burns—six months.\r\n\r\nIt was this group of women who went through the Night of Terror,\r\nsubsequently to be described.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn November 17, three more women—Mrs. Harvey Wiley, Mrs. William Kent,\r\nand Elizabeth McShane—were sentenced to fifteen days on the November 10\r\ncharges.\r\n\r\nAll these prisoners except four were sent to the Occoquan Workhouse.\r\n\r\nHabeas corpus proceedings became necessary—owing to conditions which\r\nwill presently be set forth—and a writ was procured; but only after\r\nnumberless obstacles were surmounted. The case came up in the United\r\nStates District Court at Alexandria, Virginia, with Judge Edmund Waddill\r\nsitting. Judge Waddill ordered the prisoners transferred to the jail on\r\nthe ground that they should have been confined there instead of at\r\nOccoquan Workhouse. Later the Court of Appeals reversed this decision.\r\nIn the meantime, brought to the jail, the government was faced with the\r\nnecessity of forcibly feeding the majority of these women, already\r\nweakened from hunger-striking.\r\n\r\nHere, perhaps, is the place to tell of a curious incident that happened\r\nduring Alice Paul’s jail term. For this to strike the reader with the\r\nforce it deserves, he must remember that Alice Paul was held almost\r\nincommunicado, that she saw but two friends from the outside, and then\r\nonly for a few minutes, that she could not confer with her counsel,\r\nDudley Field Malone, who had to overcome extraordinary obstacles—had\r\nfinally to threaten habeas corpus proceedings and to see high officials\r\nwho were his personal friends—to get to her. Two newspaper men were\r\nadmitted, but they were friendly to the Administration.\r\n\r\nOne evening, at nine o’clock—an hour when all the prisoners were\r\nsupposed to be in bed—the door opened and a stranger entered her room.\r\nHe proved to be David Lawrence, a newspaper man, very well known as one\r\nwho was closely associated with the Administration. He did not say that\r\nhe had come from the Administration, but, of course, it is obvious that\r\nif he had not been in favor with the Administration, he would not have\r\nbeen admitted. He stayed two hours, and Miss Paul talked over the\r\nsituation with him.\r\n\r\nI now quote Miss Younger, who has told this episode on many platforms:\r\n\r\n\r\n    He asked Miss Paul how long she and the other pickets would give the\r\n    Administration before they began picketing again. She said it would\r\n    depend upon the attitude the Administration and Congress seemed to\r\n    be taking toward the Federal Amendment. He said he believed the\r\n    prohibition bill would be brought up and passed, and after that was\r\n    out of the way the Suffrage bill would be taken up.\r\n\r\n    He asked if we would be content to have it go through one House this\r\n    session and wait till the next session for it to pass the other\r\n    House. Miss Paul said that if the bill did not go through both\r\n    Houses this session, the Woman’s Party would not be satisfied.\r\n\r\n    Then the man said he believed that the President would not mention\r\n    Suffrage in his message at the opening of Congress, but would make\r\n    it known to the leaders of Congress that he wanted it passed and\r\n    would see that it passed.\r\n\r\n    He said in effect: Now the great difficulty is for these\r\n    hunger-strikers to be recognized as political prisoners. Every day\r\n    you hunger-strike, you advertise the idea of political prisoners\r\n    throughout the country. It would be the easiest thing in the world\r\n    for the Administration to treat you as political prisoners; to put\r\n    you in a fine house in Washington; give you the best of food; take\r\n    the best of care of you; but if we treat you as political prisoners,\r\n    we would have to treat other groups which might arise in opposition\r\n    to the war program as political prisoners too, and that would throw\r\n    a bomb in our war program. It would never do. It would be easier to\r\n    give you the Suffrage Amendment than to treat you as political\r\n    prisoners.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn November 27 and 28, a few days after Miss Paul’s strange\r\nexperience—suddenly, quite arbitrarily, and with no reason assigned—the\r\ngovernment released all the Suffrage prisoners.\r\n\r\nThe speakers of the Woman’s Party began telling this story of the visit\r\nto Alice Paul’s cell, everywhere. It finally appeared in the _Milwaukee\r\nLeader_ and in the _San Francisco Bulletin_ in an article written by\r\nJohn D. Barry. The National Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage\r\nimmediately questioned the truth of this episode.\r\n\r\nCongress reconvened on December 3. The President, true to David\r\nLawrence’s prophecy, did not mention Suffrage in his message to\r\nCongress. However, on January 9, 1918, on the evening of the victorious\r\nvote in the House—as will subsequently and in more detail again be\r\ntold—the President declared for the Federal Amendment.\r\n\r\nMinnie Bronson, the General Secretary of the National Association\r\nOpposed to Woman Suffrage, immediately sent Alice Paul a letter of\r\napology for questioning the truth of her statement. In that letter, she\r\nrepeats Maud Younger’s statement in regard to this visit to Alice Paul\r\nin prison, and says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The inference contained in this article that the President of the\r\n    United States would under cover assist a proposition which he had\r\n    publicly and unqualifiedly repudiated, seemed to us unworthy of his\r\n    high office, and we felt justified in defending him from what seemed\r\n    an unwarranted and unbelievable accusation.\r\n\r\n    However, the President’s subsequent public support of the Federal\r\n    Suffrage Amendment, his announcement coming on the eve of the vote\r\n    in the House of Representatives, indicates the truth of your\r\n    original assertion, and we therefore deem it incumbent upon\r\n    ourselves to apologize for having questioned Miss Younger’s\r\n    statement.\r\n\r\n    We are sending a copy of this letter to the President and members of\r\n    Congress.\r\n\r\n              Very truly yours,\r\n\r\n                   MINNIE BRONSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps a word should be said of description—and even of explanation—in\r\nregard to the crowds who harried the Suffragists. Of course, in all\r\ncrowds there is a hoodlum element, and if that element is not held down\r\nby the police, it rapidly becomes the controlling power; tends to become\r\nmore and more destructive. The police, as has been indicated from time\r\nto time, adopted various policies. At first, they maintained order. Then\r\nthey began to permit the rowdy element in the crowds to do as it\r\npleased. Later, they even worked with these destructive forces.\r\n\r\nMen were heard to say, one to another, “Stick around here. Something’s\r\ngoing to happen this afternoon. I saw it this morning.” To them, of\r\ncourse, it was merely an entertaining exhibition.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OBEYING ORDERS.

C.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PATROL WAGON WAITING THE ARRIVAL OF THE SUFFRAGE\r\nPICKETS.\r\nPhoto Copr. Harris and Ewing, Washington, D. C.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAn enlisting sergeant used often to make his way through the crowds\r\nsaying, “Now you have shown your spirit, boys, come and enlist!”\r\n\r\nAt all times, however, the people who annoyed, and later ill-treated the\r\ngirls, were very young men—often in uniform. After a while there\r\nappeared men in plain clothes with groups of men in khaki, or yeomen,\r\nwho were obviously in the crowd for the purpose of making trouble for\r\nthe Suffragists. These people did not like cameras, and the moving\r\npicture people who, appreciating the news value of the situation, tried\r\nto get views of the crowd, did so at the risk of having their cameras\r\nsmashed. Indeed, Helena Hill Weed once dispersed a crowd by pointing a\r\ncamera at them. This was the worst element the pickets had to deal\r\nwith—unthinking young men of a semi-brutalized type. Of course, boys\r\ntook their cue from their elders, and snatched or destroyed banners\r\nwhere they could. After a demonstration, you would come across groups of\r\nthem, marching with the tattered banners that they had managed to steal.\r\n\r\n“When is the shooting going to begin?” one little boy was heard to ask\r\nonce.\r\n\r\nIn the very midst of the riots, one would come across older men cutting\r\nup banners into small pieces which they gave away as souvenirs.\r\n\r\nOf course, there were chivalrous spirits who protested against the\r\ntreatment of the pickets by the police—protested even after they were\r\nthreatened with arrest. Some of them were actually arrested, and one of\r\nthem fined.\r\n\r\nOften—very often indeed—the waiting crowds broke into spontaneous\r\napplause when group after group marched from Headquarters into the\r\ncertainty of arrest. Those who were Anglo-Saxons inevitably admired the\r\nsporting quality of these women.\r\n\r\nPerhaps a negro street sweeper summed it up better than anybody else. He\r\nsaid: “I doan know what them women want, but I know they ain’t skeered!”\r\n\r\nThe reader is probably asking by this time what was the effect of the\r\npicketing on the Woman’s Party itself. The first reaction was exactly\r\nwhat he would guess—that members resigned in large numbers. The second,\r\nhowever, was one which he might not expect—that new members joined in\r\nlarge numbers. In other words, the militant action which alienated some\r\nwomen brought others into the organization; women who were aroused by\r\nthe simple and immediate demands of the Woman’s Party and by the courage\r\nand the forthrightness with which it pushed those demands; women who had\r\nbecome impatient at the _impasse_ to which the older generation of\r\nSuffrage workers had brought the Suffrage Amendment. The majority of the\r\npeople who deserted came back later.\r\n\r\nAs far as money was concerned, the effect was magical. In some months\r\nduring the picketing the receipts were double what they had been the\r\ncorresponding months of the previous year when there had been no\r\npicketing. Once those receipts jumped as high as six times the normal\r\namount. This was what happened in England during the militant period.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     4. _The Court and the Pickets_\r\n\r\n\r\n    “So long as you send women to prison for asking for justice, so long\r\n    will women be ready to go in such a cause.”\r\n\r\n    ANNE MARTIN to the judge before whom she was tried.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter Judge Waddill’s decision that the commitment of the pickets to\r\nOccoquan was illegal, the pickets filed sixteen suits for damage. Eight\r\nof these were against Whittaker, Superintendent of the Workhouse at\r\nOccoquan, and his assistant, Captain Reams, on account of their brutal\r\ntreatment of the women while at Occoquan Workhouse. They were filed in\r\nthe United States Court for the Western District of Virginia at\r\nRichmond. The other eight were against the Commissioners of the District\r\nof Columbia and Superintendent Zinkham of the District Jail for the\r\nunlawful transfer of the pickets to the institution of Whittaker at\r\nOccoquan. These suits were filed in the Supreme Court of the District of\r\nColumbia at Washington.\r\n\r\nThe appeals in the cases of two groups of women arrested August 23 and\r\n28 came up in the District of Columbia Court of Appeals on January 8,\r\n1918, before Chief Justice Smyth, and Justices Robb and Van Orsdel.\r\nMatthew O’Brien, of Washington, and Dudley Field Malone, of New York,\r\nappeared for the Suffragists. Corporation Counsel Stevens conducted the\r\ncase for the government.\r\n\r\n\r\n    “Suppose,” suggested Justice Robb, “some upholders of Billy Sunday\r\n    should go out on the streets with banners on which were painted some\r\n    of Billy’s catch phrases, and should stand with their backs to the\r\n    fence, and a curious crowd gathered, some of whom created disorder\r\n    and threw stones at the carriers of the banners. Who should be\r\n    arrested, those who created the disorder, or the banner carriers?”\r\n\r\n    Mr. Stevens gave it as his opinion that both parties should be\r\n    arrested.\r\n\r\n    “Did I make myself clear that the banner carriers were perfectly\r\n    peaceful?” Justice Robb asked.\r\n\r\n    “When it is commonly known there is a forty-foot sidewalk there?”\r\n    Justice Van Orsdel reinforced him.\r\n\r\n    “Well, then,” observed Attorney O’Brien, when he answered Mr.\r\n    Stevens in his argument, “the honorable Justices obstruct traffic,\r\n    according to learned counsel’s definition, when court adjourns, and\r\n    they walk down the street together.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOn March 4, Judge Van Orsdel handed down the opinion, which was\r\nconcurred in by the other two judges of the court, that in the case of\r\nthose pickets who appealed, no information had been filed justifying\r\ntheir arrest and sentence. Since the offense of every other picket who\r\nwas arrested was identical with that of these twelve who appealed their\r\ncase, they were all illegally arrested, illegally convicted and\r\nillegally imprisoned. The Appellate Court thus reversed the decision of\r\nthe District Police Court. In addition, it ordered the cases dismissed.\r\nAll of the costs involved in the cases, it was decided, should be paid\r\nby the Court of the District of Columbia, for which an appropriation\r\nwould have to be made by Congressional enactment.\r\n\r\nLater, the case of Mrs. Harvey Wiley came up. It will be remembered that\r\nMrs. Wiley was one of the forty-three women who picketed the President\r\non November in the last picket line demonstration. She was sentenced to\r\nserve fifteen days in the District Jail. Dr. Wiley, her husband,\r\nappealed her case. Early in April the Court decided that there was no\r\ninformation filed justifying her arrest. So that she also was illegally\r\narrested, illegally convicted, and illegally imprisoned.\r\n\r\nYet in spite of the brutalities to which the Courts sentenced the\r\npickets, unconsciously they furthered the Suffrage cause. The women\r\nturned the Court sessions into Suffrage meetings. In defending their\r\ncase at one of the early trials, the pickets, each taking up the story\r\nwhere the other left it, told the entire history of the Suffrage\r\nmovement. Crowds thronged the Court. People attended these trials who\r\nhad never been to a Suffrage meeting in their lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        5. _The Strange Ladies_\r\n\r\n                             THE EMPTY CUP\r\n\r\n\r\n    Evening at Occoquan. Rain pelts the workhouse roof. The prison\r\n    matrons are sewing together for the Red Cross. The women prisoners\r\n    are going to bed in two long rows. Some of the Suffrage pickets lie\r\n    reading in the dim light. Through the dark, above the rain, rings\r\n    out a cry.\r\n\r\n    We listen at the windows. (Oh, those cries from punishment cells!) A\r\n    voice calls one of us by name. “Miss Burns! Miss Burns! Will you see\r\n    that I have a drink of water?” Lucy Burns arises; slips on the\r\n    coarse blue prison gown. Over it her swinging hair, red-gold, throws\r\n    a regal mantle.\r\n\r\n    She begs the night-watch to give the girl water. One of the matrons\r\n    leaves her war-bandages; we see her hasten to the cell. The light in\r\n    it goes out. The voice despairing cries: “She has taken away the cup\r\n    and she will not bring me water.” Rain pours on the roof. The\r\n    Suffragists lie awake. The matrons work busily for the Red Cross.\r\n    KATHERINE ROLSTON FISHER, _The Suffragist_, October 17, 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           WOMAN’S PARTY SONG\r\n\r\n              _Composed in Prison by the Suffrage Pickets_\r\n\r\n                     SHOUT THE REVOLUTION OF WOMEN\r\n\r\n                   Tune (Scotch):\r\n                   “Charlie Is My Darling.”\r\n\r\n                   Shout the Revolution\r\n                       Of Women, of Women,\r\n                   Shout the Revolution\r\n                       Of Liberty.\r\n                   Rise, glorious women of the earth,\r\n                       The voiceless and the free,\r\n                   United strength assures the birth\r\n                       Of True Democracy.\r\n                   Invincible our army,\r\n                       Forward, forward,\r\n                   Strong in faith we’re marching\r\n                       To Victory.\r\n\r\n                   Shout the Revolution\r\n                       Of Women, of Women,\r\n                   Shout the Revolution\r\n                       Of Liberty.\r\n                   Men’s revolutions born in blood\r\n                       But ours conceived in peace\r\n                   We hold a banner for a sword,\r\n                       ’Til all oppression cease,\r\n                   Prison, death defying,\r\n                       Onward, onward,\r\n                   Triumphant daughters marching\r\n                       To Victory.\r\n\r\nThe preceding two chapters have been concerned mainly with the treatment\r\nof the pickets at the hands of the law. We now approach a much graver\r\nmatter—their treatment at the hands of the prison authorities. This\r\nchapter describes what is one of the most disgraceful episodes in the\r\nhistory of the United States. It is futile to argue that what happened\r\nin the District Jail and at Occoquan Workhouse, and later at the\r\nabandoned Workhouse, was unknown to the Administration. The Suffragists,\r\nindeed, published it to the entire country. That the treatment to which\r\nthe pickets were subjected was the result of orders from above is almost\r\ndemonstrable. It must be remembered that the officials who are\r\nresponsible for what happened to the pickets—the three Commissioners who\r\ngovern the District of Columbia, the police court judges, the Chief of\r\nPolice, the warden of the jail, the superintendent of Occoquan\r\nWorkhouse, are directly or indirectly answerable to the President.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen the first pickets came out of prison (arrested on June 27, 1917),\r\ntheir spirit was that of women who have willingly gone to jail for a\r\ncause—and was in consequence entirely without self-pity.\r\n\r\nIn a speech at a breakfast tendered them in the garden at Headquarters,\r\nMabel Vernon sounded this note:\r\n\r\n\r\n    _I_ do not want any one here to think we have been martyrs because\r\n    of this jail experience we have had. There was no great hardship\r\n    connected with it. It was a very simple thing to do—to be imprisoned\r\n    for three days, really two nights and a day. Do not think we have\r\n    gone through any great sacrifices.\r\n\r\n    But I do not feel patient about this experience. I do not want to go\r\n    back to jail, and I do not want others to go, _because it should not\r\n    be necessary_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe jail in which the women were first imprisoned was the conventional\r\nbig white-washed octagonal building with wings at both sides. This was\r\nas filthy then as any place could be. The bathroom, with its shower was\r\na damp, dank, dark place. The jail was filled with vermin and rats.\r\nJulia Emory said that, in the night, prisoners could actually hear the\r\nlight cell chairs being moved, so big and strong were the rats. The\r\nprisoners complained so constantly that finally the prison officials put\r\npoison about; but this did not decrease them. Then they brought a dog,\r\nbut the dog was apparently afraid of the rats. The girls used to hear\r\nthe matrons telling visitors that they had got rid of the rats by means\r\nof this dog. One night, Julia Emory beat three rats in succession off\r\nher bed. Alice Paul says that among her group of jailed pickets was one\r\nwhose shrieks nightly filled the jail as the rats entered her cell.\r\n\r\nOn July 17, however, when the sixteen women charged with obstructing\r\ntraffic went to Occoquan Workhouse, things got much worse. Occoquan is\r\ncharmingly situated, and, judged superficially, seems a model\r\ninstitution. It consists of a group of white buildings placed in a\r\npicturesque combination of cultivated fields with distant hills. All\r\nabout lie the pleasant indications of rural life—crops; cows grazing;\r\nagricultural implements; even flower gardens. The District Jail cannot\r\ncompare with it for charm of situation. It has not even a pretense of\r\nthe meretricious effect of cleanliness which Occoquan shows.\r\nNevertheless, no picket who went to Occoquan emerged without a sinister\r\nsense of the horror of the place. Lucy Burns, of whom it may almost be\r\nsaid that she knows no fear, confesses that at Occoquan she suffered\r\nwith nameless and inexplicable terrors. This evidence is all the more\r\nstrange because, I reiterate, Occoquan has an effect of cleanliness, of\r\nopen air, of comfort; almost of charm. One reason for this sinister\r\natmosphere was that no question the pickets put was ever answered\r\ndirectly. If they asked to see Superintendent Whittaker, he was always\r\nout—they could see him tomorrow. If they made a request, it would be\r\ngranted to them in two days, or next week. The women’s ward was a long,\r\nclean, sunny, airy room with two rows of beds—like a hospital ward. Here\r\nthey put colored prisoners to sleep in the same room with the\r\nSuffragists. Moreover, they set the Suffragists to paint the lavatories\r\nused by the colored women. The matron who handled the bedclothes was\r\ncompelled to wear rubber gloves, but the Suffragists were permitted no\r\nsuch luxury—even in painting the lavatories. Indeed, often they slept in\r\nbeds in which the blankets had not been changed or cleaned since the\r\nlast occupant. It seemed a part of their premeditated system in the\r\ntreatment of the Suffragists that they made them all undress in the same\r\nbathroom, and, without any privacy, take shower baths one after another.\r\n\r\nThe punishment cells, of which later we shall hear in reference to the\r\nNight of Terror, were in another building. These were tiny brick rooms\r\nwith tiny windows, very high up.\r\n\r\nA young relative of one of the jail officials, in the uniform of an\r\nofficer of the United States Army, used to come into this building at\r\nnight, and look in through the undraped grating of these cells. Once he\r\nunlocked the door, and came into a room where two young pickets were\r\nsleeping. “Are you a physician?” one of them had the presence of mind to\r\nask.\r\n\r\nHe answered that he was not. She lay down, and covered her head with the\r\nbedclothes. Presently he left.\r\n\r\nThere were open toilets in all these cells, and they could only be\r\nflushed from the outside. It was necessary always to call a man guard to\r\ndo this. They came, or not, as they pleased.\r\n\r\nIn the _Suffragist_ of July 28, 1917, occurs the first account of\r\nOccoquan, by Mrs. Gilson Gardner. Mrs. Gardner, it will be remembered,\r\nwas one of that early group of sixteen pickets whom the President\r\npardoned after three days.\r\n\r\nShe says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The short journey on the train was pleasant and uneventful. From the\r\n    station at Occoquan the women sent to the Workhouse were put into\r\n    three conveyances; two were filled with white women and the third\r\n    with colored women. In the office of the Workhouse we stood in a\r\n    line and one at a time were registered and given a number. The\r\n    matron called us by number and first name to the desk. Money and\r\n    jewelry were accounted for and put in the safe. We were then sent to\r\n    the dining-room. The meal of soup, rye bread, and water was not\r\n    palatable....\r\n\r\n    From the dining-room we were taken to the dormitory. At one end of\r\n    the long room, a white woman and two colored women were waiting for\r\n    us. Before these women we were obliged, one by one, to remove all\r\n    our clothing, and after taking a shower bath, put on the Workhouse\r\n    clothes. These clothes consisted of heavy unbleached muslin chemises\r\n    and drawers, a petticoat made of ticking, and a heavy dark gray\r\n    cotton mother hubbard dress. The last touch was a full, heavy, dark\r\n    blue apron which tied around the waist. The stockings were thick and\r\n    clumsy. There were not enough stockings, and those of us who did not\r\n    have stockings during our sojourning there were probably rather\r\n    fortunate. We were told to wear our own shoes for the time being, as\r\n    they did not have enough in stock. The one small rough towel that\r\n    was given to us we were told must be folded and tucked into our\r\n    aprons. The prisoners were permitted to have only what they could\r\n    carry.\r\n\r\n    The dormitory was clean and cool and we longed to go to bed, but we\r\n    were told we must dress and go into the adjoining room where\r\n    Superintendent Whittaker would see us. Mr. Whittaker brought with\r\n    him a man whom we afterward learned was a newspaper man. The\r\n    superintendent informed us that for about an hour we could do as we\r\n    chose, and pointing to the piano said that we might play and sing.\r\n    The piano was not unlocked while we were there, but that night no\r\n    one had a desire to sing. Although Mr. Whittaker’s words were few\r\n    and not unpleasant, we realized that our presence did not cause him\r\n    either embarrassment or regret.\r\n\r\n    We were told that one dormitory was given up to colored women; in\r\n    the other one, the one in which we were to sleep, there would be\r\n    both colored and white women. We had asked to be allowed to have our\r\n    toilet things and were told we could not have them until the next\r\n    morning, that is, we would be permitted to have our combs and\r\n    toothbrushes then. But we were not permitted to have these until\r\n    Thursday. One woman told us we must not lend our comb to other\r\n    prisoners and must not mingle with the colored women....\r\n\r\n    The days were spent in the sewing-room. We were permitted to talk in\r\n    low tones, two or three being allowed to sit together. While we were\r\n    there, the sewing was very light. We turned hems on sheets and\r\n    pillow slips and sewed on the machine. There were both white and\r\n    colored women working in the sewing-room. The work was monotonous\r\n    and our clothing extremely heavy.\r\n\r\n    The great nervous strain came at meal time. All the women ate in one\r\n    big room. The white women sat at one side. The meal lasted thirty\r\n    and sometimes forty minutes. The food to us was not palatable, but\r\n    we all tried to be sensible and eat enough to keep up our strength.\r\n    The real problem, however, was not the food; it was the enforced\r\n    silence. We were not allowed to speak in the dining-room, and after\r\n    a conscientious effort to eat, the silent waiting was curiously\r\n    unpleasant....\r\n\r\n    The use of the pencil is forbidden at all times. Each inmate is\r\n    permitted to write but two letters a month, one to her family and\r\n    one business letter. All mail received and sent is opened and read\r\n    by one of the officials. Next to our longing for our own toilet\r\n    articles was our desire for a pencil and a scrap of paper. Another\r\n    rule which makes life in the Workhouse more difficult than life in\r\n    the jail is that the Workhouse prisoners are not permitted to\r\n    receive any food sent in from outside.\r\n\r\n    We found that the other prisoners were all amazed at the excessive\r\n    sentences we had received. Old offenders, they told us, received\r\n    only thirty days.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the _Suffragist_ of August 11, Doris Stevens, who was a member of the\r\nsame group says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    No woman there will ever forget the shock and the hot resentment\r\n    that rushed over her when she was told to undress before the entire\r\n    company, including two negress attendants and a harsh-voiced\r\n    wardress, who kept telling us that it was “after hours,” and they\r\n    “had worked too long already today,” as if it were our fault that we\r\n    were there. We silenced our impulse to resist this indignity, which\r\n    grew more poignant as each woman nakedly walked across the great\r\n    vacant space to the doorless shower....\r\n\r\n    “We knew something was goin’ to happen,” said one negro girl,\r\n    “because Monday,” (we were not sentenced until Tuesday) “the clo’es\r\n    we had on were took off us and we were given these old patched ones.\r\n    We was told they wanted to take stock, but we heard they were being\r\n    washed for you-all Suffragists.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that this was that early group of pickets whom the\r\nPresident pardoned after the appeals of J. A. H. Hopkins, Dudley Field\r\nMalone, and Gilson Gardner. Before leaving they were taken to\r\nSuperintendent Whittaker.\r\n\r\nAsking for the attention of Miss Burns and the rest of them, he said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “_Now that you are going, I have something to say to you._” And\r\n    turning to Miss Burns, he continued, “_And I want to say it to you.\r\n    The next lot of women who come here won’t be treated with the same\r\n    consideration that these women were._”\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Virginia Bovee, an officer of Occoquan Workhouse, was discharged in\r\nSeptember. At that time Lucy Burns filed charges with Commissioner\r\nBrownlow of the District of Columbia concerning conditions in the\r\nWorkhouse. Evidence is submitted on Whittaker’s brutal treatment of\r\nother prisoners, but our concern must be with his treatment of the\r\nSuffragists.\r\n\r\nLucy Burns says in that complaint:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The hygienic conditions have been improved at Occoquan since a group\r\n    of Suffragists were imprisoned there. But they are still bad. The\r\n    water they drink is kept in an open pail, from which it is ladled\r\n    into a drinking cup. The prisoners frequently dip the drinking cup\r\n    directly into the pail.\r\n\r\n    The same piece of soap is used for every prisoner. As the prisoners\r\n    in Occoquan are sometimes afflicted with disease, this practice is\r\n    appallingly negligent.\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Bovee’s affidavit reads in part:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The blankets now being used in the prison have been in use since\r\n    December without being washed or cleaned. Blankets are washed once a\r\n    year. Officers are warned not to touch any of the bedding. The one\r\n    officer who has to handle it is compelled by the regulations to wear\r\n    rubber gloves while she does so. The sheets for the ordinary\r\n    prisoners are not changed completely, even when one has gone and\r\n    another takes her bed. Instead, the top sheet is put on the bottom,\r\n    and one fresh sheet given them. I was not there when these\r\n    Suffragists arrived, so I do not know how their bedding was\r\n    arranged. I doubt whether the authorities would have dared to give\r\n    them one soiled sheet.\r\n\r\n    The prisoners with diseases are not always isolated, by any means.\r\n    In the colored dormitory there are now two women in advanced stages\r\n    of consumption. Women suffering from syphilis, who have open sores,\r\n    are put in the hospital. But those whose sores are temporarily\r\n    healed are put in the same dormitory with the others. There have\r\n    been several such in my dormitory.\r\n\r\n    When the prisoners come, they must undress and take a shower bath.\r\n    For this they take a piece of soap from a bucket in the storeroom.\r\n    When they have finished, they throw the soap back in the bucket. The\r\n    Suffragists are permitted three showers a week, and have only these\r\n    pieces of soap which are common to all inmates. There is no soap at\r\n    all in the washrooms.\r\n\r\n    The beans, hominy, rice, corn meal (which is exceedingly coarse,\r\n    like chicken feed), and cereal have all had worms in them. Sometimes\r\n    the worms float on top of the soup. Often they are found in the corn\r\n    bread. The first Suffragists sent the worms to Whittaker on a spoon.\r\n    On the farm is a fine herd of Holsteins. The cream is made into\r\n    butter, and sold to the tuberculosis hospital in Washington. At the\r\n    officers’ table, we have very good milk. The prisoners do not have\r\n    any butter, or sugar, and no milk except by order of the doctor.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs time went on and great numbers of pickets were arrested, more and\r\nmore indignities were put on them. They were, in every sense, political\r\nprisoners, and were entitled to the privileges of political prisoners.\r\nIn all countries distinction is made in the treatment of political\r\nprisoners. Of course, the hope of the Administration was that these\r\ndegrading conditions would discourage the picketing, and, of course, the\r\nresults were—as has happened in the fight for liberty during the whole\r\nhistory of mankind—that more and more women came forward and offered\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nIn the _Suffragist_ for October 13, 1917 (“From the Log of a Suffrage\r\nPicket”), Katherine Rolston Fisher writes the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Upon entering Occoquan Workhouse, we were separated from the\r\n    preceding group of Suffragists. Efforts were made by the officers to\r\n    impress us by their good will towards us. Entirely new clothing,\r\n    comfortable rooms in the hospital, and the substitution of milk and\r\n    buttered toast for cold bread, cereal, and soup, ameliorated the\r\n    trials of the table. The head matron was chatty and confidential.\r\n    She told us of the wonderful work of the superintendent in creating\r\n    these institutions out of the wilderness and of the kindness shown\r\n    by the officers to inmates. She lamented that some of the other\r\n    Suffragists did not appreciate what was done for them....\r\n\r\n    “Why are we segregated from all the white prisoners?” I asked the\r\n    superintendent of the Workhouse. Part of the time we were not\r\n    segregated from the colored prisoners, a group of whom were moved\r\n    into the hospital and shared with us the one bathroom and toilet.\r\n    “That is for your good and for ours,” was the bland reply....\r\n\r\n    That was quite in the tone of his answer to another inquiry made\r\n    when the superintendent told me that no prisoner under\r\n    punishment—that is, in solitary confinement—was allowed to see\r\n    counsel. “Is that the law of the District of Columbia?” I inquired.\r\n    “It is the law here because it is the rule I make,” he replied.\r\n\r\n    We learned what it is to live under a one-man law. The doctor’s\r\n    orders for our milk and toast and even our medicine were\r\n    countermanded by the superintendent, so we were told. Our counsel\r\n    after one visit was forbidden, upon a pretext, to come again.\r\n\r\n    On Tuesday, September 18, we were made to exchange our new gingham\r\n    uniforms for old spotted gray gowns covered with patches upon\r\n    patches; were taken to a shed to get pails of paint and brushes, and\r\n    were set to painting the dormitory lavatories and toilets. By this\r\n    time we were all hungry and more or less weak from lack of food. A\r\n    large brush wet with white paint weighs at least two pounds. Much of\r\n    the work required our standing on a table or stepladder and reaching\r\n    above our heads. I think the wiser of us rested at every\r\n    opportunity, but we did not refuse to work.\r\n\r\n    All this time we had been without counsel for eight days....\r\n\r\n    The food, which had been a little better, about the middle of the\r\n    month reached its zenith of rancidity and putridity. We tried to\r\n    make a sport of the worm hunt, each table announcing its score of\r\n    weevils and worms. When one prisoner reached the score of fifteen\r\n    worms during one meal, it spoiled our zest for the game....\r\n\r\n    We had protested from the beginning against doing any manual labor\r\n    upon such bad and scanty food as we received....\r\n\r\n    Mrs. Kendall, who was the most emphatic in her refusal, was promptly\r\n    locked up on bread and water. The punishment makes a story to be\r\n    told by itself. It clouded our days constantly while it lasted and\r\n    while we knew not half of what she suffered....\r\n\r\n    All this time—five days—Mrs. Kendall was locked up, her pallid face\r\n    visible through the windows to those few Suffragists who had\r\n    opportunity and ventured to go to her window for a moment at the\r\n    risk of sharing her fate.\r\n\r\n\r\nAda Davenport Kendall’s story runs as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    For stating that she was too weak from lack of food to scrub a floor\r\n    and that the matron’s reply that there was no other work was\r\n    “hypocritical,” Mrs. Kendall was confined in a separate room for\r\n    four days for _profanity_. She was refused the clean clothing she\r\n    should have on the day of her confinement, and was therefore forced\r\n    to wear the same clothing for eleven days. She was refused a\r\n    nightdress, or clean linen for the bed in the room. The linen on her\r\n    bed was soiled from the last occupant and Mrs. Kendall lay on top of\r\n    it all. The only toilet accommodation consisted of an open pail.\r\n    Mrs. Kendall was allowed no water for toilet purposes during the\r\n    four days, and was given three thin slices of bread and three cups\r\n    of water a day. The water was contained in a small paper cup, and on\r\n    several occasions it seeped through.\r\n\r\n\r\nFriends of Mrs. Kendall’s obtained permission to see her. She was then\r\ngiven clean clothing, and taken from the room in which she was in\r\nsolitary confinement. When the door opened upon her visitors, she\r\nfainted.\r\n\r\nAroused by an inspection of samples of food smuggled out to him by\r\nSuffrage prisoners, Dr. Harvey Wiley, the food expert, requested the\r\nBoard of Charities to permit him to make an investigation of the food.\r\n“A Diet of Worms won one revolution, and I expect it will win another,”\r\npromulgated Dr. Wiley.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe most atrocious experience of the pickets at Occoquan was, however,\r\non the night known to them generally as _The Night of Terror_. This\r\nhappened to that group of Suffragists who were arrested on November 14,\r\nsentenced to Occoquan, and who immediately went on hunger-strike as a\r\nprotest against not being treated as political prisoners and as the last\r\nprotest they could make against their imprisonment. Whittaker was away\r\nwhen they arrived, and they were kept in the office which was in the\r\nfront room of one of the small cottages. Out of these groups there\r\nalways evolved a leader. If the group included the suave and determined\r\nLucy Burns, she inevitably took command. If it included Mrs. Lawrence\r\nLewis, equally velvet-voiced and immovable, she inevitably became\r\nspokesman. This group included both. The Suffragists were then still\r\nmaking their demand to be treated as political prisoners, and so, when\r\nthe woman at the desk—a Mrs. Herndon—attempted to ask the usual\r\nquestions, Mrs. Lewis, speaking for the rest, refused to answer them,\r\nsaying that she would wait and talk to Mr. Whittaker.\r\n\r\n“You will sit here all night then,” said Mrs. Herndon.\r\n\r\nThe women waited for hours.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lewis always describes what follows as a sinister reversal of a\r\nFrench tale of horror she read in her girlhood. In that story, people\r\nbegan mysteriously to disappear from a group. One of them would be\r\ntalking one instant—the next he was gone; the space where he stood was\r\nempty. In this case, slowly, silently, and in increasing numbers, men\r\nbegan to appear from outside, three and then four.\r\n\r\nMrs. Herndon again tried to get the Suffragists to register, but they\r\nmade no reply.\r\n\r\n“You had better answer up, or it will be the worse for you,” said one\r\nman.\r\n\r\n“I will handle you so you’ll be sorry you made me,” said another.\r\n\r\nThe Suffragists did not reply. Mrs. Nolan says that she could see that\r\nMrs. Herndon was afraid of what was going to happen.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the door burst open, and Whittaker came rushing in from a\r\nconference, it was later discovered, of the District of Columbia\r\nCommissioners at the White House—followed by men—more and more of them.\r\nThe Suffragists had been sitting or lying on the floor. Mrs. Lewis stood\r\nup.\r\n\r\n“We demand to be treated as political pris——” she began. But that was as\r\nfar as she got.\r\n\r\n“You shut up! I have men here glad to handle you!” Whittaker said.\r\n“Seize her!”\r\n\r\nTwo men seized Mrs. Lewis, dragged her out of the sight of the remaining\r\nSuffragists.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, another man sprang at Mrs. Nolan, who, it will be\r\nremembered, was over seventy years old, very frail and lame. She says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I am used to being careful of my bad foot, and I remember saying: “I\r\n    will come with you; do not drag me. I have a lame foot.” But I was\r\n    dragged down the steps and away into the dark. I did not have my\r\n    feet on the ground. I guess that saved me.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was black outside, and all Mrs. Nolan remembers was the approach to a\r\nlow, dark building from which, made brilliantly luminous by a window\r\nlight, flew the American flag.\r\n\r\nAs Mrs. Nolan entered the hall, a man in the Occoquan uniform,\r\nbrandishing a stick, called, “Damn you! Get in there!” Before she was\r\nshot through this hall, two men brought in Dorothy Day,—a very slight,\r\ndelicate girl; her captors were twisting her arms above her head.\r\nSuddenly they lifted her, brought her body down twice over the back of\r\nan iron bench. One of the men called: “The damned Suffrager! My mother\r\nain’t no Suffrager! I will put you through hell!” Then Mrs. Nolan’s\r\ncaptors pulled her down a corridor which opened out of this room, and\r\npushed her through the door.\r\n\r\nBack of Mrs. Nolan, dragged along in the same way, came Mrs. Cosu, who,\r\nwith that extraordinary thoughtfulness and tenderness which the pickets\r\nall developed for each other, called to Mrs. Nolan: “Be careful of your\r\nfoot!”\r\n\r\nThe bed broke Mrs. Nolan’s fall, but Mrs. Cosu hit the wall. They had\r\nbeen there but a few minutes when Mrs. Lewis, all doubled over like a\r\nsack of flour, was thrown in. Her head struck the iron bed, and she fell\r\nto the floor senseless.\r\n\r\nThe other women thought she was dead. They wept over her.\r\n\r\nUltimately, they revived Mrs. Lewis, but Mrs. Cosu was desperately ill\r\nall night, with a heart attack and vomiting. They were afraid that she\r\nwas dying, and they called at intervals for a doctor, but although there\r\nwas a woman and a man guard in the corridor, they paid no attention.\r\nThere were two mattresses and two blankets for the three, but that was\r\nnot enough, and they shivered all night long.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, I now quote from Paula Jakobi’s account. We go back to\r\nthat moment in the detention room when they seized Mrs. Lewis.\r\n\r\n\r\n    “And seize her!” rang in my ears, and Whittaker had me by the arm.\r\n    “And her!” he said, indicating Dorothy Day. Miss Day resisted. Her\r\n    arm was through the handle of my bag. Two men pulled her in one\r\n    direction, while two men pulled me in the opposite direction. There\r\n    was a horrible mix-up. Finally, the string of the bag broke. Two men\r\n    dragged her from the room. I saw it was useless to resist. The man\r\n    at the right of me left me, and tightly grasped in the clutches of\r\n    the man at my left, I was led to a distant building.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Julia Emory, who was rushed along just after Mrs. Jakobi, entered\r\nthe building, the two guards were smashing Dorothy Day’s back over the\r\nback of a chair; she was crying to Paula Jakobi for help; and Mrs.\r\nJakobi, struggling with the other two guards, was trying to get to her.\r\nThey placed Julia Emory in a cell opposite Lucy Burns.\r\n\r\nOf the scene in the reception room of the Workhouse, Mrs. John Winters\r\nBrannan, who saw all this from a coign of vantage which apparently\r\nsurveyed the whole room, says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I firmly believe that, no matter how we behaved, Whittaker had\r\n    determined to attack us as part of the government plan to suppress\r\n    picketing.... Its (the attack’s) perfectly unexpected ferocity\r\n    stunned us. I saw two men seize Mrs. Lewis, lift her from her feet,\r\n    and catapult her through the doorway. I saw three men take Miss\r\n    Burns, twisting her arms behind her, and then two other men grasp\r\n    her shoulders. There were six to ten guards in the room, and many\r\n    others collected on the porch—forty to fifty in all. These all\r\n    rushed in with Whittaker when he first entered.\r\n\r\n    Instantly the room was in havoc. The guards brought from the male\r\n    prison fell upon us. I saw Miss Lincoln, a slight young girl, thrown\r\n    to the floor. Mrs. Nolan, a delicate old lady of seventy-three, was\r\n    mastered by two men. The furniture was overturned, and the room was\r\n    a scene of havoc.\r\n\r\n    Whittaker in the center of the room directed the whole attack,\r\n    inciting the guards to every brutality.\r\n\r\n    The whole group of women were thrown, dragged, and hurled out of the\r\n    office, down the steps, and across the road and field to the\r\n    Administration Building, where another group of bullies was waiting\r\n    for us. The assistant superintendent, Captain Reams, was one of\r\n    these, armed with a stick which he flourished at us, as did another\r\n    man. The women were thrown roughly down on benches.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Lucy Burns, fighting desperately all the way, had been\r\ndeposited in a cell opposite.\r\n\r\nAs always, when she was arrested, she took charge of the situation. In\r\nher clear, beautiful voice, she began calling the roll one name after\r\nanother, to see if all were there and alive. The guards called, “Shut\r\nup!” but she paid no more attention to them than if they had not spoken.\r\n“Where is Mrs. Lewis?” she demanded. Mrs. Cosu answered: “They have just\r\nthrown her in here.” The guard yelled to them that if they spoke again,\r\nhe would put them in strait-jackets. Mrs. Nolan and Mrs. Cosu were so\r\nterrified that they kept still for a while.\r\n\r\nBut Lucy Burns went right on calling the roll. When she refused—at the\r\nguard’s orders—to stop this, they handcuffed her wrists and fastened the\r\nhandcuffs above her head to the cell door. They threatened her with a\r\nbuckle gag. Little Julia Emory could do nothing to help, of course, but\r\nshe put her hands above her head in exactly the same position and stood\r\nbefore her door until they released Lucy Burns. Lucy Burns wore her\r\nhandcuffs all night.\r\n\r\nMrs. Henry Butterworth, for some capricious reason, was taken away from\r\nthe rest, and placed in a part of the jail where there were only men.\r\nThey told her that she was alone with the men, and that they could do\r\nwhat they pleased with her. Her Night of Terror was doubly\r\nterrifying—with this menace hanging over her.\r\n\r\nFor a description of the rest of that night, and of succeeding days, I\r\nquote the account of Paula Jakobi:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I didn’t know at the time what happened to the other women. I only\r\n    knew that it was hell let loose with Whittaker as the instigator of\r\n    the horror. In the ante-chamber to the cells, some of the guards\r\n    were standing, swinging night sticks in a menacing manner. We were\r\n    thrust into cells; the ventilators were closed. The cells were\r\n    bitter cold. There was an open toilet in the corner of the cell,\r\n    which was flushed from the outside. We had to call a guard who had\r\n    previously attacked us to flush them. The doors were barred, there\r\n    were no windows. The doors were uncurtained, so that through the\r\n    night the guard could look into the cell. There was no light in the\r\n    room, only one in the corridor. Three of us were thrown into every\r\n    cell. There was a single bed in each room and a mattress on the\r\n    floor. The floors were filthy as were the blankets.\r\n\r\n    In the morning, we were roughly told to get up. No facilities for\r\n    washing were given us. Faint, ill, exhausted, we were ordered before\r\n    the superintendent. It was eight o’clock and we had had no food\r\n    since the preceding day at twelve. None had been offered us, nor\r\n    were any inquiries made about our physical condition. Whittaker\r\n    asked my name; then whether I would go to the Workhouse and obey\r\n    prison regulations and be under the care of the ladies. I told him I\r\n    would not. I would not wear prison clothes, and I demanded the\r\n    rights of political prisoners. He interrupted me with, “Then you’ll\r\n    go to the male hospital”—he emphasized the “male”—“and be in\r\n    solitary confinement. Do you change your mind?” I said “No!” and was\r\n    taken to the hospital by a trusty.\r\n\r\n    Then followed a series of bullying, of privileges, and of curtailing\r\n    them. The first day at three o’clock milk and bread were brought to\r\n    the room. After I refused it, it was taken away. That evening some\r\n    more milk and bread were brought. These were left in the room all\r\n    night. The second day toast and milk were brought. These were left\r\n    in the room all night. The third day the matron suggested an egg and\r\n    coffee for breakfast. I told her I did not want anything to eat.\r\n    This day at lunch time fried chicken and salad were brought in.\r\n    Later Miss Burns passed a note which read, “I think this riotous\r\n    feast which has just passed our doors is the last effort of the\r\n    institution to dislodge all of us who can be dislodged. They think\r\n    there is nothing in our souls above fried chicken.” No matter what\r\n    was offered, a glass of milk and piece of bread were left from meal\r\n    to meal, and once bouillon and bread was left.\r\n\r\n    The fast did not make me ill at this time, only weak. The second day\r\n    there was slight nausea and headache; the third day, fever and\r\n    dizziness; the fever remained, causing very dry, peeling skin and\r\n    swollen lips. By the third day, I was rather nervous—there were no\r\n    other manifestations except increasing weakness and aphasia. I could\r\n    remember no names, and it was quite impossible to read.\r\n\r\n    We were summoned so often and so suddenly from our rooms to see\r\n    Whittaker, or to have the rooms changed—we were in the same room\r\n    scarcely two consecutive nights—that one was never sure when she\r\n    would be searched and when the few remaining treasures would be\r\n    taken from us, so I hid stubs of pencils in my pillow, ripping the\r\n    ticking with a hairpin, and one pencil in the hem of the shade. The\r\n    dimes and nickels for the trusty I placed in a row over the sill of\r\n    the door, paper behind the steam radiator pipes. It was difficult to\r\n    find places to secrete anything, for the only furniture in the room\r\n    was a single iron bed and one chair. Notes to one another are passed\r\n    by tapping furtively on the steampipe running through the walls;\r\n    then, when the answer comes, passing the note along the pipe.\r\n    Everything is conducive to concealment.\r\n\r\n    The second day our writing materials were asked for (I did not give\r\n    up those I had hidden). Then we were summoned to Whittaker—each of\r\n    the hunger-strikers. (There were now seventeen of us.) He had a\r\n    stenographer with him. He asked my name; then, “Are you\r\n    comfortable?” His manner was quite changed; he was as civil as he\r\n    could be. I answered him with the little formula, “I demand the\r\n    right to be treated as a political prisoner. I am now treated as a\r\n    common criminal.”\r\n\r\n    He: If you have steak and vegetables, will you go to the Workhouse\r\n    and obey rules?\r\n\r\n    I: I will not.\r\n\r\n    He: If you will promise not to picket any more and to leave\r\n    Washington soon, I will let you go without paying any fine and I’ll\r\n    take you to Washington in my own automobile.\r\n\r\n    I: I will not promise this.\r\n\r\n    He: What is it you want?\r\n\r\n    I: The right to keep my own clothes, to have nourishing food\r\n    permanently, which will not be taken away and given back at your\r\n    will, the right to send and receive mail, and above all, the right\r\n    to see counsel and have fresh air exercise.\r\n\r\n    He: If I grant you all these things, will you go to the Workhouse\r\n    and work?\r\n\r\n    I: I will not.\r\n\r\n    He: Are the matrons and interns kind to you?\r\n\r\n    I: Yes.\r\n\r\n    He: What food is left in your room?\r\n\r\n    I: Chiefly bread and milk, once bouillon and toast.\r\n\r\n    He: Anything else?\r\n\r\n    I: No.\r\n\r\n    He: Have you any request?\r\n\r\n    I: That I receive the rights due me—those of a political prisoner.\r\n\r\n    Whittaker will use these interviews in expurgated form, I am sure.\r\n    When I said anything which did not please him, he said to the\r\n    stenographer, “You needn’t put that down.”\r\n\r\n    After the above interviews, he absolutely refused to let our counsel\r\n    who came from Washington see us.\r\n\r\n    After my visit to Whittaker this day, I was summoned to the\r\n    Workhouse. My clothes were listed—those I wore—before two matrons,\r\n    just as those of criminals are listed; then I was obliged to undress\r\n    before the two matrons and two trusties, walk to a shower, take a\r\n    bath, and dress before them in prison clothes. The clothes were\r\n    clean, but so coarse that they rubbed my skin quite raw. They have\r\n    two sizes of shoes for the prisoners—large and small.\r\n\r\n    The only message which reached me from “outside” was a telegram from\r\n    a friend asking that I allow my bail to be paid. I answered that I\r\n    would not. This day six girls in our section were taken away\r\n    “somewhere.” The sense of some unknown horror suddenly descending is\r\n    the worst of the whole situation. Whittaker’s suave manner was\r\n    interrupted for a moment this day when he came into the hospital\r\n    ward and saw Julia Emory in the corridor—she was returning from the\r\n    wash-room—and taking Julia by the neck he threw her into her cell.\r\n    “Get in there,” he snarled, or words to that effect.... I was coming\r\n    out of an adjoining wash-room at the moment, and saw this.\r\n\r\n    This night I had a most vivid dream. The interne brought in a\r\n    rabbit. He held it up and told us he would cook it for us. The\r\n    women—our women—did not wait for him to cook it, but rushed toward\r\n    him, pulled it from his hands, and tore the living animal into\r\n    pieces and ate it. I awoke, sobbing.\r\n\r\n    Next evening, there was great commotion in our corridor. The doors,\r\n    which did not lock, were held; there were rapid footsteps to and\r\n    fro. Distressed sounds came from the room adjoining mine, and soon\r\n    it was evident that Miss Burns was being forcibly fed. Half an hour\r\n    earlier, her condition was found normal by the doctor, who strolled\r\n    casually through our ward, looked in at the door, nodded, felt her\r\n    pulse, and went on. Now Miss Burns was being forcibly fed. What\r\n    could it mean? Then there were more hurried steps, and the men went\r\n    to Mrs. Lewis’s room. Fifteen minutes later, they were both hurried\r\n    into an ambulance and taken away—no one told us where. We had\r\n    visions accentuated that night, of being separated, hurried out of\r\n    sight to oblivion, somewhere away from every one we knew.\r\n\r\n\r\nA detachment of the United States Marines guarded the place. The\r\nprisoners were kept incommunicado. That meant, not only were they not\r\nallowed visitors, but they were not allowed counsel—and counsel is one\r\nof the inalienable rights of citizenship.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime at Headquarters, the Suffragists, under the leadership\r\nof Doris Stevens, now that Alice Paul and Lucy Burns were both in\r\nprison, could not even find out where the prisoners were. They had\r\nreceived a jail sentence but were not in the District Jail. Katherine\r\nMorey, in great anxiety in regard to her mother, who was one of the\r\nprisoners, came from Boston to see her. She could not even locate her.\r\nFinally, she hit on the device of meeting the morning train, on which\r\nreleased prisoners always came from Occoquan, and one of them informed\r\nher that her mother was at the Workhouse.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, sixteen of the women had gone on a hunger-strike. They\r\nwere committed to Occoquan on Wednesday, November 14. By the following\r\nSunday, Superintendent Whittaker became alarmed. He declared he would\r\nnot forcibly feed any of them unless they signed a paper saying that\r\nthey themselves were responsible for any injury upon their health. Of\r\ncourse, they all refused to do this, whereupon Superintendent Whittaker\r\nsaid: “All right, you can starve.” However, by Sunday night, he was a\r\nlittle shaken in this noble resolution. He went to Mrs. Lewis, and asked\r\nher what could be done. Mrs. Lewis answered that all they asked was to\r\nbe treated as political offenders, which provided for exercise,\r\nreceiving of mail and visitors, buying food and reading matter. He asked\r\nher to write this statement out in his name, as though he demanded it.\r\nOn Monday he brought the statement to the Commissioners of the District\r\nof Columbia. Commissioner Gardner gave out a statement that such demands\r\nwould never be granted.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime too, Matthew O’Brien, the counsel for the Woman’s Party,\r\nsucceeded in getting an order from the Court which admitted him to\r\nOccoquan. He saw Mrs. Lewis, Mrs. Brannan, and Miss Burns once; but\r\nafterwards in spite of his Court order, they refused him admission.\r\n\r\nIt had been part of the system in attempting to lower Miss Burns’s\r\nmorale to take her clothes away from her. When Mr. O’Brien visited Miss\r\nBurns she was lying on a cot in a dark cell, wrapped in blankets. He\r\ncame back to Headquarters filled with admiration for her extraordinary\r\nspirit. He said that she was as much herself as if they were talking in\r\nthe drawing-room of Cameron House. Mrs. Nolan, released at the end of\r\nher six day sentence, also brought the news of what happened back to\r\nHeadquarters. These were the things that made the Suffragists determine\r\non habeas corpus proceedings. Mr. O’Brien applied to the United States\r\nDistrict Court at Richmond for this writ. It was granted returnable on\r\nNovember 27. Mr. O’Brien, however, afraid that, in combination with the\r\nindignities to which they were being submitted, the women would collapse\r\nfrom starvation, made another journey to Judge Waddill, who set the\r\nhearing forward to the 23rd.\r\n\r\nThe next step was serving the writ on Superintendent Whittaker. This was\r\ndone by a ruse. On the night of the 21st, Mr. O’Brien called at\r\nSuperintendent Whittaker’s home. He was told that the Superintendent was\r\nnot there. Mr. O’Brien went not far away, and telephoned that he would\r\nnot return until the morning. Then he returned immediately to\r\nSuperintendent Whittaker’s home, found him there, of course, and served\r\nthe papers.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Superintendent Whittaker began to fear that Mrs.\r\nLawrence Lewis and Lucy Burns would die. Unknown to the other\r\nprisoners—and thereby causing them the most intense anguish—he had them\r\ntaken to the hospital of the District Jail. They had been forcibly fed\r\nat Occoquan, and the feeding was continued at the jail.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lewis writes:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I was seized and laid on my back, where five people held me, a young\r\n    colored woman leaping upon my knees, which seemed to break under the\r\n    weight. Dr. Gannon then forced the tube through my lips and down my\r\n    throat, I gasping and suffocating with the agony of it. I didn’t\r\n    know where to breathe from, and everything turned black when the\r\n    fluid began pouring in. I was moaning and making the most awful\r\n    sounds quite against my will, for I did not wish to disturb my\r\n    friends in the next room. Finally the tube was withdrawn. I lay\r\n    motionless. After a while I was dressed and carried in a chair to a\r\n    waiting automobile, laid on the back seat, and driven into\r\n    Washington to the jail hospital. Previous to the feeding I had been\r\n    forcibly examined by Dr. Gannon, I struggling and protesting that I\r\n    wished a woman physician.\r\n\r\n\r\nLucy Burns was fed through the nose. Her note, smuggled out of jail, is\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Wednesday, 12 M. Yesterday afternoon at about four or five, Mrs.\r\n    Lewis and I were asked to go to the operating room. Went there and\r\n    found our clothes. Told we were to go to Washington. No reason, as\r\n    usual. When we were dressed Dr. Gannon appeared, said he wished to\r\n    examine us. Both refused. Were dragged through halls by force, our\r\n    clothing partly removed by force, and we were examined, heart\r\n    tested, blood pressure and pulse taken. Of course such data was of\r\n    no value after such a struggle. Dr. Gannon told me that I must be\r\n    fed. Was stretched on bed, two doctors, matron, four colored\r\n    prisoners present, Whittaker in hall. I was held down by five people\r\n    at legs, arms, and head. I refused to open mouth, Gannon pushed the\r\n    tube up left nostril. I turned and twisted my head all I could, but\r\n    he managed to push it up. It hurts nose and throat very much and\r\n    makes nose bleed freely. Tube drawn out covered with blood.\r\n    Operation leaves one very sick. Food dumped directly into stomach\r\n    feels like a ball of lead. Left nostril, throat, and muscles of neck\r\n    very sore all night. After this I was brought into the hospital in\r\n    an ambulance. Mrs. Lewis and I placed in same room. Slept hardly at\r\n    all.\r\n\r\n    This morning Dr. Ladd appeared with his tube. Mrs. Lewis and I said\r\n    we would not be forcibly fed. Said he would call in men guards and\r\n    force us to submit. Went away and we not fed at all this morning. We\r\n    hear them outside now cracking eggs.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe resume Paula Jakobi’s account:\r\n\r\n\r\n    We were summoned two days later to appear at Alexandria jail next\r\n    day, Friday of that week—that would make nine days spent in the\r\n    Workhouse.\r\n\r\n    A writ of habeas corpus had been issued for our unjust imprisonment\r\n    at Occoquan when we had been sentenced to Washington jail. This day\r\n    I fainted. It was now seven and a half days since I had started\r\n    hunger-striking. Three young doctors came in to have a look at the\r\n    hunger-strikers. They did not take our pulse; they just gazed and\r\n    departed. Later in the day, I was told that I could not go to court\r\n    next day if I did not eat, as they would not take the responsibility\r\n    for my trip. They prepared to forcibly feed me. I concluded to eat\r\n    voluntarily, since I had to break my fast, so that evening I had a\r\n    baked potato and a baked apple. Next morning I ate no breakfast, but\r\n    was threatened with forcible feeding at noon if I did not eat, so I\r\n    ate again.\r\n\r\n    The next day we were taken to Alexandria Court House. There we found\r\n    out why Miss Burns and Mrs. Lewis had been taken away from Occoquan.\r\n    It was to prevent their appearance at Court, although it was shown\r\n    that Whittaker had been removed after he had received the writ of\r\n    habeas corpus. Our counsel pleaded for their appearance in Court.\r\n    The warden of the Washington jail, where they now were, was so\r\n    solicitous for their health that he feared to move them. Mr. Dudley\r\n    Field Malone asked him whether they were being forcibly fed. The\r\n    warden replied that they were. “How many men does it take to hold\r\n    Miss Burns?” Mr. Malone quietly questioned, “while she is being\r\n    forcibly fed?” Zinkham answered, “Four.” “Then, your Honor,” asked\r\n    Mr. Malone, “don’t you think that if it takes four men to hold Miss\r\n    Burns to give her forcible feeding, she is strong enough to appear\r\n    in Court?”\r\n\r\n\r\nNext day, both Mrs. Lewis and Miss Burns were at the trial.\r\n\r\n\r\n    It was found that our detention in the Workhouse was illegal and we\r\n    were given our freedom on parole. I refused to accept it, and with\r\n    twenty-two other prisoners was taken to Washington jail to finish my\r\n    term of imprisonment.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Suffragists were brought from Occoquan to the Court on November 23,\r\naccording to schedule. Their condition was shocking. They all showed in\r\ntheir pallor and weakness the effect of the brutal régime to which they\r\nhad been subjected. The older women could hardly walk, and were\r\nsupported by their younger and stronger companions. When they reached\r\ntheir chairs, they lay back in them, utterly worn out. Mrs. John Winters\r\nBrannan collapsed, and had to be taken from the Courtroom.\r\n\r\nAs Paula Jakobi has stated, Judge Waddill decided that the thirty-one\r\nSuffragists had been illegally committed to Occoquan Workhouse, and were\r\nentitled to liberation on bail pending an appeal or the return to the\r\nDistrict Jail. Rose Winslow, it will be remembered, was tried at the\r\nsame time as Alice Paul and received a sentence of seven months. Here\r\nare some extracts from the prison notes of Rose Winslow smuggled out to\r\nfriends:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The women are all so magnificent, so beautiful. Alice Paul is as\r\n    thin as ever, pale and large-eyed. We have been in solitary for five\r\n    weeks. There is nothing to tell but that the days go by somehow. I\r\n    have felt quite feeble the last few days—faint, so that I could\r\n    hardly get my hair combed, my arms ached so. But today I am well\r\n    again. Alice Paul and I talk back and forth though we are at\r\n    opposite ends of the building and a hall door also shuts us apart.\r\n    But occasionally—thrills—we escape from behind our iron-barred doors\r\n    and visit. Great laughter and rejoicing!...\r\n\r\n    I told about a syphilitic colored woman with one leg. The other one\r\n    was cut off, having rotted so that it was alive with maggots when\r\n    she came in. The remaining one is now getting as bad. They are so\r\n    short of nurses that a little colored girl of twelve, who is here\r\n    waiting to have her tonsils removed, waits on her. This child and\r\n    two others share a ward with a syphilitic child of three or four\r\n    years, whose mother refused to have it at home. It makes you\r\n    absolutely ill to see it. I am going to break all three windows as a\r\n    protest against their boarding Alice Paul with these!\r\n\r\n    Dr. Gannon is chief of a hospital. Yet Alice Paul and I found we had\r\n    been taking baths in one of the tubs here, in which this syphilitic\r\n    child, an incurable, who has his eyes bandaged all the time, is also\r\n    bathed. He has been here a year. Into the room where he lives came\r\n    yesterday two children to be operated on for tonsillitis. They also\r\n    bathed in the same tub. The syphilitic woman has been in that room\r\n    seven months. Cheerful mixing, isn’t it? The place is alive with\r\n    roaches, crawling all over the walls everywhere. I found one in my\r\n    bed the other day....\r\n\r\n\r\nIn regard to the forcible feeding, she said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Yesterday was a bad day for me in feeding. I was vomiting\r\n    continually during the process. The tube has developed an irritation\r\n    somewhere that is painful....\r\n\r\n    I fainted again last night. I just fell flop over in the bathroom\r\n    where I was washing my hands, and was led to bed, when I recovered,\r\n    by a nurse. I lost consciousness just as I got there again. I felt\r\n    horribly faint until twelve o’clock, then fell asleep for awhile....\r\n\r\n    The same doctor feeds us both.... Don’t let them tell you we take\r\n    this well. Miss Paul vomits much. I do, too, except when I’m not\r\n    nervous, as I have been every time but one. The feeding always gives\r\n    me a severe headache. My throat aches afterward, and I always weep\r\n    and sob, to my great disgust, quite against my will. I try to be\r\n    less feeble-minded.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe final barbarity, however, in the treatment of the pickets came out\r\nin the experience of Alice Paul. Of course, the Administration felt that\r\nin jailing Alice Paul, they had the “ringleader.” That was true. What\r\nthey did not realize, however, was that they had also jailed the\r\ninspired reformer, the martyr-type, who dies for a principle, but never\r\nbends or breaks. Miss Paul was arrested, it will be remembered, on\r\nOctober 20. The banner that she carried had, in the light of later\r\nevents, a grim significance. It bore President Wilson’s own words:\r\n\r\n          THE TIME HAS COME TO CONQUER OR SUBMIT. FOR US THERE\r\n                CAN BE BUT ONE CHOICE. WE HAVE MADE IT.\r\n\r\nHer sentence was seven months.\r\n\r\n“I am being imprisoned,” said Miss Paul as she was taken from the\r\nDistrict Police Court to the patrol wagon that carried her to jail, “not\r\nbecause I obstructed traffic, but because I pointed out to President\r\nWilson the fact that he is obstructing the progress of justice and\r\ndemocracy at home while Americans fight for it abroad.”\r\n\r\nWhen Alice Paul reached the jail, she found ten other Suffragists who\r\nhad been brought there four days before from Occoquan. The air of this\r\njail was stifling. There were about seventy-five women prisoners locked\r\nin three tiers of cells, and no window had been opened. The first appeal\r\nof the Suffragists to Alice Paul was for air.\r\n\r\nAlice Paul, not committed to her cell yet, looked about her. High up she\r\nsaw a little, round window with a rope hanging from it. She asked the\r\nmatron why they did not open the window. “If we started opening windows,\r\nwe should have to give the colored women more clothes,” the matron told\r\nher.\r\n\r\nWith her usual promptness and decision Alice Paul crossed the corridor\r\nand pulled the window open. There was no place to fasten the rope so she\r\nstood there holding it. The matron called for the guards. Two of them,\r\nunusually big and husky in comparison with Alice Paul’s ninety-five\r\npounds, tried to take the rope away. It broke in her hands, the window\r\nclosed, and the guards carried Miss Paul to her cell.\r\n\r\nAlice Paul had brought, in the pocket of her coat, a volume of Browning.\r\nBefore they closed the door, she threw it with what Florence Boeckel\r\ndescribes as a “desperate, sure aim,” through the window.\r\n\r\nMiss Paul’s confrères say that it is amusingly symbolic of the\r\nperfection of her aim in all things that she hit one of the little panes\r\nof that far-away window. As the glass had not been repaired when the\r\nSuffragists left jail, they had the pure air they demanded. They said\r\nthat the old-timers told them it was the first good air they had ever\r\nsmelled in jail.\r\n\r\nAlice Paul and Rose Winslow went on hunger-strike at once. This strike\r\nlasted three weeks and a day. The last two weeks they were forcibly fed.\r\nBoth women became so weak that they were finally moved to the hospital.\r\n\r\nTwo or three alienists with Commissioner Gardner were brought in to\r\nexamine Alice Paul. They usually referred to her in her presence as\r\n“this case.” One of the alienists, visiting her for the first time, said\r\nto the nurse, “Will this patient talk?” Alice Paul burst into laughter.\r\n\r\n“Talk!” she exclaimed. “That’s our business to talk. Why shouldn’t we\r\ntalk?”\r\n\r\n“Well, some of them don’t talk, you know,” the alienist said.\r\n\r\n“Well, if you want me to talk——” Weak as she was, Miss Paul sat up in\r\nbed and gave him a history of the Suffrage movement beginning just\r\nbefore the period of Susan B. Anthony and coming down to that moment. It\r\nlasted an hour. This alienist told the present writer that in his report\r\nto the authorities he said in effect:\r\n\r\n“There is a spirit like Joan of Arc, and it is as useless to try to\r\nchange it as to change Joan of Arc. She will die but she will never give\r\nup.”\r\n\r\nAlice Paul says that she realized after a while that the questions of\r\nthe alienists were directed towards establishing in her one of the\r\nwell-known insane phobias—the mania of persecution. The inquiries\r\nconverged again and again toward one point: “Did she think the President\r\npersonally responsible for what was occurring?” As it happened her\r\nsincere conclusion in this matter helped in establishing their\r\nconviction of her sanity. She always answered that she did not think the\r\nPresident was responsible in her case—that he was perhaps uninformed as\r\nto what was going on.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the favorable report of the alienist, after a while they\r\nremoved Alice Paul from the hospital to the psychopathic ward. The\r\nconditions under which she lived here are almost incredibly sinister. It\r\nis difficult to avoid the conclusion that it was hoped that they would\r\naffect Alice Paul’s reason; would certainly discredit the movement she\r\nled by making the world believe that she was mentally unbalanced. The\r\nroom in which she was confined was big and square, pleasant enough. It\r\nhad two windows, one of which they boarded up. They took off the wooden\r\ndoor and replaced it with a grated door. All day long patients—mentally\r\nunbalanced—came to that door and peered in at her. All night long,\r\nshrieks rang in her ears. Just before dawn would come an interval of\r\nquiet, then invariably it was broken by the long, harrowing, ululating\r\ncries of a single patient who kept this up for hours.\r\n\r\nOne of the alienists told the nurse to keep Miss Paul under observation.\r\nThis observation consisted of flashing a light in her face every hour\r\nall night long. This—naturally—brought her with a start out of her\r\nsleep. She averaged, she says, only a little sleep between flashes. Of\r\ncourse one cannot but think that if she had been trembling on the verge\r\nof insanity, this process would certainly have pushed her over the edge.\r\n\r\nThe women nurses were almost unfailingly kind and thoughtful. One\r\ncarried her kindness to the point of saying once, “You know, I don’t\r\nthink you are insane.” Alice Paul says, it was staggering to have people\r\nexpress their friendliness for you by assuring you that they thought you\r\nwere in your right mind. The doctor who forcibly fed her protested\r\nagainst having to do it. She was kept in the psychopathic ward a week\r\nincommunicado. When it was discovered where she was, Dudley Field Malone\r\ngot her removed back to the hospital. Of course the forcible feeding\r\nwent on.\r\n\r\nIn the files at Headquarters, there are dozens of affidavits made by the\r\nwomen who went to jail for picketing. It is a great pity that they\r\ncannot all be brought to the attention of a newly enfranchised sex. More\r\nburningly than anything else, these affidavits would show that sex what\r\nwork lies before them, as far as penal institutions are concerned. I\r\nquote but one of them—that of Ada Davenport Kendall—because it sums up\r\nso succinctly and specifically the things that the prison pickets saw.\r\n\r\n\r\n    I went into Occoquan Prison as a prisoner on September 13, 1917.\r\n\r\n    I went in with the idea of obeying the regulations and of being a\r\n    reasonable prisoner.\r\n\r\n    While there I saw such injustice, neglect, and cruelty on the part\r\n    of the officials that I was forced into rebellion.\r\n\r\n    During my thirty days’ imprisonment I saw that commissioners and\r\n    other officials made occasional visits but that the people in charge\r\n    were usually warned and used much deception on the occasion of these\r\n    visits. Specially prepared food replaced the wormy, fermenting, and\r\n    meager fare of ordinary days. Girls too frail to work were hurried\r\n    off the scrubbing and laundry gangs, and were found apparently\r\n    resting. Sick women were hidden. Girls were hurried out of\r\n    punishment cells as the visitors proceeded through the buildings,\r\n    and were hidden in linen rooms or rooms of matrons already\r\n    inspected.\r\n\r\n    While there I was treated with indignities. I was insulted by\r\n    loud-mouthed officials at every turn, was stripped before other\r\n    women, stripped of all toilet necessities, warm underwear, and\r\n    ordinary decencies, was deprived of soap, tooth-brush, writing\r\n    materials, and sufficient clothing and bed coverings. I was dressed\r\n    first in clean garments, but the officials later punished me by\r\n    putting me in unclean clothing and into a filthy bed in which a\r\n    diseased negress had slept. In the hospital I was obliged to use the\r\n    toilet which diseased negro women used, although there was a clean\r\n    unused toilet in the building.\r\n\r\n    With the four other women who were sentenced with me I was fed food\r\n    filled with worms and vile with saltpeter; food consisting of\r\n    cast-off and rotting tomatoes, rotten horse meat and insect-ridden\r\n    starches. There were no fats: no milk, butter, nor decent food of\r\n    any kind. Upon this fare I was put at hard labor from seven a.m.\r\n    until five p.m., with a short luncheon out. We were not allowed to\r\n    use the paper cups we had brought, but were forced to drink from an\r\n    open pail, from common cups.\r\n\r\n    After several days of driven labor this group was ordered to wash\r\n    the floors and clean the toilets in the dormitory for the colored\r\n    inmates. I protested for the whole group: said we would not do this\r\n    dangerous work. For this I was put in solitary confinement which\r\n    lasted for nearly seven days. Water was brought three times in the\r\n    twenty-four hours, in a small paper cup. Three thin slices of bread\r\n    were brought in twenty-four hours. Several times matrons with\r\n    attendants came in and threatened me and threw me about. They\r\n    searched me for notes or any writing, and threw me about and tore my\r\n    clothes. I was allowed no water for toilet, and the only toilet\r\n    convenience was an open bucket. No reading nor writing materials\r\n    were allowed. Mail was cut off, as it was nearly all of the time\r\n    while I was in prison. I was not allowed to see an attorney during\r\n    this period. The bed had been slept in and was filthy, and there was\r\n    no other furniture. After six days, influential friends were able to\r\n    reach my case from outside the prison, and I was taken out of\r\n    solitary confinement.\r\n\r\n    While in prison I heard men and women crying for help, and heard the\r\n    sound of brutal lashes for long periods,—usually in the evening,\r\n    after visitors were not expected.\r\n\r\n    I saw a woman have a hemorrhage from the lungs at nine in the\r\n    morning—saw her lie neglected, heard the matrons refuse to call a\r\n    doctor; and at eleven saw the woman carry a tobacco pail filled with\r\n    water to scrub a floor; saw her bleeding while she was scrubbing,\r\n    and when she cried a matron scolded her.\r\n\r\n    Saw a young dope fiend who was insane run out of a door, and heard a\r\n    matron at the telephone order men to loose the bloodhounds upon this\r\n    girl in the dark. Soon heard the dogs howling and running about.\r\n\r\n    Saw men with fetters on legs being driven to and from work.\r\n\r\n    Saw matrons choke and shake girls.\r\n\r\n    Was continually disgusted with lack of fair play in the institution.\r\n\r\n    Inmates were set to spy upon the others, and were rewarded or\r\n    punished, as they played the game of the matrons.\r\n\r\n    Saw sick girls working in laundry. Saw diseased women sleeping,\r\n    bathing, and eating with other inmates.\r\n\r\n    Saw armed men driving prisoners to work.\r\n\r\n    Saw milk and vegetables shipped to Washington, and rotting\r\n    vegetables brought up from city market.\r\n\r\n    Saw unconscious women being brought from punishment cells.\r\n\r\n    Saw sick women refused medical help, and locked in the hospital\r\n    without attendance to suffer. Saw them refused milk or proper food.\r\n    Saw them refused rest, and once I saw the only medical attendant\r\n    kick at a complaining inmate and slam the office door in her face.\r\n\r\n    Found that while the institution was supposed to build and improve\r\n    inmates, they were ordinarily not allowed any recreation nor proper\r\n    cleanliness. No classes were held, and no teaching of any sort was\r\n    attempted. They were deprived of all parcels, and mail was usually\r\n    withheld both coming and going. Visitors and attorneys were held up,\r\n    and the prisoners usually absolutely shut away from help.\r\n\r\n    Found that no rules governing the rights of the prisoners had been\r\n    codified by the Congressional Committee responsible for the\r\n    institution, and was told by the superintendent that the prisoners\r\n    had no rights and that the superintendent could treat the inmates as\r\n    he liked.\r\n\r\n    Under that management, the matrons, while apparently ordinarily\r\n    decent and often making a good first impression, were found to be\r\n    brutal and unreasonable in their care of inmates.\r\n\r\n    The inmates were driven, abused, insulted. They were not allowed to\r\n    speak in the dining-room or workrooms or dormitories. It was a place\r\n    of chicanery, sinister horror, brutality, and dread.\r\n\r\n    No one could go there for a stay who would not be permanently\r\n    injured. No one could come out without just resentment against any\r\n    government which could maintain such an institution.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs has been told before Judge Waddill decided that the pickets had been\r\nillegally transferred from the Jail to Occoquan and they were sent back\r\nto the Jail. But between Occoquan and Jail occurred one night, in which\r\nthe pickets were released in the custody of Dudley Field Malone, their\r\ncounsel. They went immediately to Cameron House and broke their\r\nhunger-strike—spent the evening before the fire, talking and sipping hot\r\nmilk. The next day they were committed to jail again and immediately\r\nstarted a new hunger-strike.\r\n\r\nThe government, however, undoubtedly appalled by the protests that came\r\nfrom all over the country, and perhaps, in addition, staggered at the\r\nprospect of forcibly feeding so many women, released them all three days\r\nlater.\r\n\r\nA mass-meeting was held at the Belasco Theatre early in December to\r\nwelcome them. The auditorium was crowded and there was an overflow\r\nmeeting of four thousand outside on the sidewalk. The police reserves,\r\nwho had so often, in previous months, come out to arrest pickets, now\r\ncame out to protect them from the thousands of people who gathered in\r\ntheir honor. Elsie Hill addressed this overflow meeting, which shivered\r\nin the bitter cold for over an hour, yet stayed to hear her story.\r\n\r\nInside, eighty-one women in white, all of whom had served in the Jail or\r\nthe Workhouse, carrying lettered banners and purple, white, and gold\r\nbanners, marched down the two center aisles of the theatre and onto the\r\nstage. There were speeches by Mrs. Thomas Hepburn, Dudley Field Malone,\r\nMrs. William Kent, Mrs. O. H. P. Belmont, and Maud Younger. Then came an\r\ninterval in which money was raised. Two touching details were sums of\r\nfifty cents and thirty cents pledged from Occoquan “because the\r\nSuffragettes helped us so much down there.” And Mrs. John Rogers, Jr.,\r\non behalf of the pickets gave “tenderest thanks for this help from our\r\ncomrades in the Workhouse.”\r\n\r\nEighty-six thousand, three hundred and eighty-six dollars was raised in\r\nhonor of the pickets.\r\n\r\nOn that occasion, prison pins which were tiny replicas in silver of the\r\ncell doors, were presented to each “prisoner of freedom.”\r\n\r\nAs Alice Paul appeared to receive her pin, Dudley Field Malone called,\r\n“Alice Paul,” and the audience leaped to its feet; the cheers and\r\napplause lasted until she disappeared at the back of the platform.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is a poignant regret to the present author that she cannot go further\r\ninto conditions at the District Jail and at Occoquan in regard to the\r\nother prisoners there. But that is another story and must be told by\r\nthose whose work is penal investigation. The Suffragists uncovered\r\nconditions destructive to body and soul; incredibly inhumane! One of the\r\nheart-breaking handicaps of the swift, intensive warfare of the pickets\r\nwas that, although they did much to ameliorate conditions for their\r\nfellow prisoners, they could not make them ideal. Piteous appeal after\r\npiteous appeal came to them from their “comrades in the Workhouse.”\r\n\r\n“If we go on a hunger-strike, will they make things better for us?” the\r\nother prisoners asked again and again.\r\n\r\n“No,” the Suffragists answered sadly. “You have no organization back of\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\nHowever, in whatever ways were open to them the Suffragists offered\r\ncounsel and assistance of all kinds.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI asked one of the pickets once how the other prisoners regarded them.\r\nShe answered: “They called us ‘the strange ladies.’”\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   II\r\n\r\n                          TELLING THE COUNTRY\r\n\r\n\r\nIN the meantime, the country had not been kept misinformed or uninformed\r\nin regard to the treatment of the pickets. Of course, the press teemed\r\nwith descriptions of their protests and its results. Again and again\r\ntheir activities pushed war news out of the preferred position on the\r\nfront page of the newspapers. Again and again they snatched the\r\nheadlines from important personages and events. But despite flaming\r\nheadlines, these newspaper accounts were inevitably brief and\r\nincomplete; sometimes unfair. The Woman’s Party determined that the\r\ngreat rank and file, who might be careless or cautious of newspaper\r\nnarration, should hear the whole extraordinary story. Picketing began in\r\nJanuary, 1917. By the end of September, long before Alice Paul’s arrest\r\nand through October and November, therefore, speakers were sent all over\r\nthe United States. Alice Paul divided the States into four parts, twelve\r\nStates each: Maud Younger went to the South; Mrs. Lawrence Lewis and\r\nMabel Vernon to the Middle West; Anne Martin to the far West; Abby Scott\r\nBaker and Doris Stevens to the East. Ahead of them went the swift band\r\nof organizers who always so ably and intensively prepared the way for\r\nWoman’s Party activity.\r\n\r\nPublic opinion became more and more intrigued, began to blaze oftener\r\nand oftener into protest as successive parties of pickets were arrested.\r\nThe climax, of course, was the climactic Administration mistake—the\r\narrest of Alice Paul. And as it began to dawn on the country that she\r\nwas kept incommunicado ... that she was in the psychopathic ward ...\r\nalienists ... hunger-striking ... forcible feeding....\r\n\r\nThe speakers had extraordinary experiences, especially those who went\r\ninto the strongholds of the Democrats in the South. Again and again when\r\nthey told about the jail conditions, and how white women were forced\r\ninto association with the colored prisoners, were even compelled to\r\npaint the toilets used by the colored prisoners, men would rise in the\r\naudience and say, “There are a score of men here who’ll go right up to\r\nWashington and burn that jail down.” It has been said that Warden\r\nZinkham received by mail so many threats against his life that he went\r\narmed.\r\n\r\nFrom Headquarters, telegrams were sent to speakers as the situation grew\r\nat Washington, informing them as to the arrests, the actions of the\r\npolice, sentences, et caetera. Often these telegrams would come in the\r\nmidst of a speech. The speaker always read them to the audience. Once\r\nafter Doris Stevens had read such a telegram, “Do you protest against\r\nthis?” she demanded of her audience. “We do!” they yelled, rising as one\r\nman to their feet.\r\n\r\nSuddenly while everything was apparently going smoothly, audiences\r\nlarge, indignantly sympathetic, actively protestive, change came.\r\nEverywhere obstacles were put in the way of the speakers. That this was\r\nthe result of concerted action on the part of the authorities was\r\nevident from the fact that within a few days four speakers in different\r\nparts of the country felt this blocking influence.\r\n\r\nIn Arkansas they recalled Mabel Vernon’s permit for the Court House. In\r\nConnecticut, newspapers began to call Berta Crone pro-German, to attack\r\nher in a scurrilous manner.\r\n\r\nAnne Martin’s meeting throughout the West had gone on without\r\ninterruption of any kind. When, however, she arrived in Los Angeles, she\r\nwas met by a Federal officer and told that there could be no meeting in\r\nLos Angeles. Miss Martin’s answer was to read to him a section on the\r\nright of free speech and assemblage, to inform him that he could not\r\nprevent the meeting, to assure him that he was welcome to attend it, and\r\nto invite him to arrest her if she made any seditious remarks. The\r\nattempt was then made to get her right to use the hotel ball-room, in\r\nwhich she was to hold the meeting, canceled. However, when Miss Martin\r\ntold the management that she had made the same speech at the St. Francis\r\nHotel in San Francisco, they agreed to let her have the hall. Federal\r\nofficers sat on the platform and interrupted her speech, saying, “You’ve\r\nsaid enough about the President now.” Anne Martin replied, “If I’ve said\r\nanything seditious it’s your duty to arrest me. Otherwise I’m going on\r\nwith my speech.” The audience applauded. Within a few minutes, five\r\nhundred dollars was collected in that audience for the struggle in the\r\nCapitol. Later, one of the Secret Service men warned Miss Martin not to\r\nmake the same speech in San Diego. “I told him,” Miss Martin said, “to\r\nfollow me and arrest me at any time he wished to, but in the meantime to\r\nstop speaking to me.” She had no further trouble in California.\r\n\r\nMaud Younger’s experiences in the South and West were so incredible in\r\nthese days of free speech that it deserves a detailed narration.\r\n\r\nShe had passed through nine southern Democratic States. Every speech had\r\nbeen received enthusiastically, with sympathy, and without question.\r\nSuddenly the cry of “Treason,” “Pro-German,” was raised. She was to\r\nspeak at Dallas, Texas, on Monday, November 18. But the organizer found\r\nshe could not engage a hall nor even a room at the hotel in which Miss\r\nYounger could speak. The Mayor would not allow her to hold a street\r\nmeeting. Miss Younger, whose speeches are always the maximum of\r\naccuracy, informedness, feeling—coupled with a kind of diplomatic\r\nsuavity—offered to submit her speech for censorship. They refused her\r\neven that. Finally on Monday morning a hall was found and engaged. The\r\npeople who rented it canceled that engagement on Monday afternoon. The\r\nreporters flocked to see Miss Younger, who astutely said to them, “Of\r\ncourse the President is not responsible for—etc, etc.”—ad libitum—not\r\nresponsible, in brief, for all the things she would have said in her\r\nspeech. Miss Condon, who was organizing in that vicinity, had a little\r\noffice on the top floor and decided to hold a meeting there. Miss\r\nYounger spoke to a small audience drummed up as hastily as possible,\r\nnotifying newspaper and police when the audience was about to arrive.\r\nThere were detectives present. Miss Younger takes great joy in the fact\r\nthat in attending this meeting, these detectives, following the accepted\r\ntactics of detectives, heavy-handedly—or heavy-footedly—got out of the\r\nelevator on the floor below; tiptoed solemnly up to the floor of the\r\nmeeting, thus proclaiming loudly to the world that they were detectives.\r\n\r\nIn Memphis, Miss Younger had the assistance of Sue White, who, not then\r\na member of the Woman’s Party, became subsequently one of its most\r\nactive, able, and devoted workers. Miss White who is very well known in\r\nher State, had just gained great public approbation by registering fifty\r\nthousand women for war work. She fought hard and constantly to preserve\r\nMiss Younger’s speaking schedule in the nine Tennessee towns. But it was\r\nimpossible in many cases. Everywhere they were fought by the Bar\r\nAssociation and the so-called Home Defense Leagues; and often by civic\r\nofficials. The Bar Association et caetera appointed a committee to go to\r\nall hotels, or meeting-places, to ask them not to rent rooms for Miss\r\nYounger’s meetings, and to mayors to request them not to grant permits\r\nfor street meetings. The Mayor of Brownsville, for instance, telephoned\r\nto the Mayor of Jackson: “I believe in one God, one Country, and one\r\nPresident; for God’s sake keep those pickets from coming to\r\nBrownsville.” Fortunately everywhere, as has almost invariably happened\r\nin the Suffrage movement, Labor came to their rescue.\r\n\r\nIn the towns where it was impossible to get a hall, Miss Younger did not\r\nstay to fight it out. First of all, she felt the situation had developed\r\ninto a free speech fight between the people of these towns and their\r\nlocal governments. It was for them to make the fight. Moreover, she\r\nwanted as far as possible to keep to her schedule.\r\n\r\nSue White went on ahead to Jackson, which was her own home town, and\r\nappealed to the Judge for the use of the Court House. The Mayor said he\r\ncould not legally prevent the meeting. Miss White opened the Court House\r\nand lighted it. In the meantime, the Chief of Police met Miss Younger in\r\nthe Court House before the meeting began. He told her if she said\r\nanything against the President, he would arrest her. He came to the\r\nmeeting that night, but left as soon as he discovered how harmless it\r\nwas—harmless, that is, so far as the President was concerned. The\r\naudience unanimously passed a resolution asking the Mayor of Nashville,\r\nwhich was the next stop, to permit Miss Younger to speak.\r\n\r\nHowever, when she got to Nashville, the Home Defense League had brought\r\npressure on the local authorities and it was impossible for her to get a\r\nhall. The organizer had hired the ball-room of the hotel, had deposited\r\ntwenty-five dollars for it; but the manager broke his contract, refused\r\nto allow them to use it, and refunded the money. The prosecuting\r\nattorney, months later, boasted, “I was the one that kept Miss Younger\r\nfrom speaking in Nashville.”\r\n\r\nThe next two towns were Lebanon and Gallatin. In Lebanon, although they\r\ncould get no hall, they were allowed to speak in the public square. Sue\r\nWhite introduced Miss Younger. It was a bitter cold day; but the weather\r\nwas not colder than the audience at first. Gradually, however, that\r\naudience warmed up. When Miss Younger finished, they called, “We are all\r\nwith you!” When the Suffragists reached Gallatin, they secured the\r\nschoolhouse. There was no time for any publicity, but Rebecca Hourwich\r\nhired a wagon and went about the town calling, “Come to the schoolhouse!\r\nHear the White House pickets!”\r\n\r\nIn Knoxville, they met with the same hostility from the Bar Association.\r\nTheir permit to speak in the town hall was revoked, and even the street\r\nwas denied to them. Joy Young, thereupon, went to Labor. The local Labor\r\nleader, who was the editor of the Labor paper, saw at once that it was a\r\nfree speech fight. He said that Labor would make the fight for the\r\nSuffragists. He also pointed out that though the Mayor was a Democrat,\r\nthe Judge was a Republican. He went to the Judge and asked for the Court\r\nHouse. The Judge said that it was not within his power to grant the\r\nCourt House; that three county officials, to whom, twelve years before,\r\njurisdiction in this matter had been given, must decide the question.\r\nThese county officials agreed to the proposition. Again the Bar\r\nAssociation interfered. All day long telephone pressure, pro and con,\r\nwas brought to bear on these county officials. In the end it was decided\r\nto have a preliminary rehearsal of Miss Younger’s speech.\r\n\r\nAt high noon, therefore, Maud Younger went to the Court House. The\r\nprosecuting attorney opened the proceedings by reading from a big book\r\nan unintelligible excerpt on sedition. Miss Younger then made her\r\nforceful, witty, and tactful speech. Of course they gave her the Court\r\nHouse. The prosecuting attorney said, “For an hour I argued against you\r\nwith the Judge. Now, I don’t see how he could possibly refuse.” The\r\nJudge said, “You women have a very real grievance.” Late as it was, Joy\r\nYoung got out dodgers, inviting the town to the meeting and scattered\r\nthem everywhere, and the afternoon papers carried the announcement.\r\n\r\nThat night at dinner, the editor of the Labor paper called. He told them\r\nthat the Sheriff had suddenly put up the claim of jurisdiction over the\r\ncounty Court House taken from him twelve years ago, and that he would be\r\nthere with a band of armed deputies. “_But_,” said the Labor leader,\r\n“_Labor will be there with eighty armed Union men to meet them_.” Of\r\ncourse the two Woman’s Party speakers did not know what would happen.\r\nBut the only thing they did know was that they would hold the meeting as\r\nusual. So Maud Younger and Joy Young proceeded alone to the Court House.\r\nThey both expected to be shot. The Sheriff with his deputies, instead of\r\nsurrounding the building, went inside, holding the place against\r\nSuffrage attack. The Labor men stationed themselves in front of the\r\ndoor. The steps were filled with audience. Joy Young introduced the\r\nspeaker. Maud Younger took up her position, and they held their meeting\r\noutside. Miss Younger always says: “The Sheriff had the Court House, but\r\nI had the audience.”\r\n\r\nAt Chattanooga, Joy Young had explained the situation; The Mayor was\r\nwith them; the Bar Association, the Chief of Police, the Sheriff were\r\nagainst them; so the Mayor with the assistance of Labor and the\r\nnewspapers took up their fight. No hall was to be had, _and someone in\r\nthe Bar Association instructed the Chief of Police to enter any private\r\nhouse and break up any meeting the Suffragists might hold; and the\r\nSheriff to do the same in the country outside the city limits_. But\r\nLabor was not to be outwitted. They were holding a scheduled meeting in\r\ntheir own hall that night. Labor canceled that meeting and offered Maud\r\nYounger the hall free. They said they would like to see any police break\r\nup a meeting in _their_ hall. All day long there was a stormy session of\r\nthe Commissioners as to whether or not she might speak. But in the end\r\nshe did speak.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLater, when Maud Younger returned to Washington, she met Senator\r\nMcKellar in the course of her lobbying activities. Of course, she was\r\nastute enough to know that orders for all this persecution had come from\r\nabove. She referred quite frankly to his efforts to stop her in\r\nTennessee. With equal frankness, Senator McKellar said: “I wasn’t going\r\nto have you talking against the President in Tennessee.”\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  III\r\n\r\n                       MORE PRESSURE ON CONGRESS\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE various activities described in the last six chapters all took place\r\nin the year 1917. But during all this year—when the picketing, the\r\narrests, the imprisonments, were going on—work with Congress was of\r\ncourse proceeding parallel with it. It now becomes necessary to go back\r\nto the very beginning of the year to follow that work.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that early in this year there occurred in\r\nWashington an event of national political importance. The Congressional\r\nUnion for Woman Suffrage and the Woman’s Party merged into one\r\norganization.\r\n\r\nThis union of the Congressional Union with the Woman’s Party occurred on\r\nMarch 2. On March 3—the last day of his first Administration—President\r\nWilson despatched the following letter to the Hon. W. R. Crabtree, a\r\nmember of the Tennessee Legislature.\r\n\r\n\r\n    May I not express my earnest hope that the Senate of Tennessee will\r\n    reconsider the vote by which it rejected the legislation extending\r\n    the Suffrage to women? Our Party is so distinctly pledged to its\r\n    passage that it seems to me the moral obligation is complete.\r\n\r\n                   WOODROW WILSON.\r\n\r\n    On April 26 occurred a hearing before the Senate Committee; Anne\r\n    Martin presided. The note she struck in her opening speech sounded\r\n    all through the hearing—the somber, sinister note of the Great War;\r\n    and the necessity of accepting the Suffrage Amendment as a war\r\n    measure.\r\n\r\n\r\n        “We regard it as an act of the highest loyalty and patriotism,”\r\n        she said, “to urge the passage of the Amendment at this time,\r\n        that we may, as fully-equipped, fully-enfranchised citizens, do\r\n        our part in carrying out and helping to solve the problems that\r\n        lie before the government when our country is at war.”\r\n\r\n\r\nMadeline Doty, who had traveled in Germany and in England since the\r\nbeginning of the war, gave her testimony in regard to the degree of war\r\nwork women were contributing in those two countries. Others spoke: Mary\r\nBeard, Ernestine Evans, Mrs. Richard Wainwright, Alice Carpenter, Hon.\r\nJeannette Rankin, and Dudley Field Malone, at that time still Collector\r\nof the Port of New York.\r\n\r\nAltogether, there was a different sound to these Suffrage arguments.\r\nWomen had discovered for the first time in the history of the world that\r\nthey were a national necessity in war, not only because they bore the\r\nsoldiers who fought, not only because they nursed the wounded, but\r\nbecause their efforts in producing the very sinews of war were necessary\r\nto its continuance.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn May 14, the Committee appointed by the National Party (the Party\r\nformed by the former Progressive leaders): J. A. H. Hopkins, Dr. E. A.\r\nRumley, John Spargo, Virgil Hinshaw, Mabel Vernon, called on the\r\nPresident for the purpose of discussing the passage of the Federal\r\nSuffrage Amendment as part of the war program.\r\n\r\nMabel Vernon described the interview afterwards:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The President said frankly that the lines were well laid for the\r\n    carrying out of a program in this session of Congress in which\r\n    Suffrage, he intimated, has not been included and expressed his\r\n    belief that the introducing of the question at this time might\r\n    complicate matters. He seems to feel, however, that the coming of\r\n    war has put the enfranchisement of women on a new basis.\r\n\r\n    He showed his appreciation of the rapid gains Suffrage has made\r\n    through the country when he said, “Suffrage is no longer creeping,\r\n    but advancing by strides.”\r\n\r\n    The President told the Committee as proof of his willingness, as he\r\n    said, “to help Suffrage in every little way,” that he had written a\r\n    letter to Representative Pou, Chairman of the Rules Committee of the\r\n    House, saying he would favor the creation of a Woman Suffrage\r\n    Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day, May 15, a hearing was held before the Judiciary Committee\r\nof the House. The Progressive Committee, who had visited the President\r\nthe day before, spoke, and also a group of the Woman’s Party leaders:\r\nMrs. William H. Kent, Mrs. John Rogers, Mrs. Donald R. Hooker, Lucy\r\nBurns, Anne Martin, Abby Scott Baker. Again the note of the Great War\r\nsounded through all the speeches, and the impatience of women because\r\neverything in the way of war service was demanded of them, but nothing\r\ngiven in return.\r\n\r\nMrs. Rogers said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    You men sit here in Congress and plan to take our sons and husbands\r\n    and every cent in our pockets. Yet you say to us: “Do not be\r\n    selfish; do not ask anything of the government now, but do your\r\n    part.”\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Rogers quoted the words of Lord Northcliffe:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The old arguments against giving women Suffrage were that they were\r\n    useless in war. But we have found that we could not carry on the war\r\n    without them. They are running many of our industries, and their\r\n    services may be justly compared to those of our soldiers.\r\n\r\n\r\n“It has taken England nineteen hundred years to find this out,” said\r\nMrs. Rogers.\r\n\r\nAlso, stress was laid on the fact that, since the last hearing before\r\nthe Judiciary Committee, six States had granted Presidential Suffrage to\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\nIn this connection, a letter written by Chairman Webb of the Judiciary\r\nCommittee to J. A. H. Hopkins of New Jersey, is interesting.\r\n\r\nMr. Hopkins wrote Mr. Webb:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The suggestion in your letter, that your caucus resolution provides\r\n    that the President might from time to time suggest special war\r\n    emergency legislation, puts the responsibility for the inaction of\r\n    your Committee upon the President. As the President has already\r\n    stated that he will be glad to do everything he can to promote the\r\n    cause of Woman Suffrage, it seems to me quite evident that he has at\r\n    least given your Committee the opportunity to exercise their own\r\n    authority without even the fear that they may be infringing upon\r\n    your caucus rules.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the answer which Chairman Webb sent to Mr. Hopkins, he put the\r\nresponsibility of the inaction in regard to the Suffrage situation\r\ndirectly on the President.\r\n\r\nHe said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Democratic caucus passed a resolution that only war emergency\r\n    measures would be considered during this extra session, and that the\r\n    President might designate from time to time special legislation\r\n    which he regarded as war legislation, and such would be acted upon\r\n    by the House. The President not having designated Woman Suffrage and\r\n    national prohibition so far as war measures, the Judiciary Committee\r\n    up to this time has not felt warranted, under the caucus rule, in\r\n    reporting either of these measures. If the President should request\r\n    either or both of them as war measures, then I think the Committee\r\n    would attempt to take some action on them promptly. So you see after\r\n    all it is important to your cause to make the President see that\r\n    Woman Suffrage comes within the rules laid down.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn May, the Rules Committee of the House of Representatives granted a\r\nhearing to Suffrage bodies on the question of the creation of a Suffrage\r\nCommittee in the House. It will be remembered that this is the first\r\ntime since December, 1913, that the Rules Committee had granted this\r\nrequest, although women have worked for the creation of a Suffrage\r\nCommittee in the House since the days of Susan B. Anthony. Chairman Pou\r\npresided.\r\n\r\nA few days before, he had received a letter from President Wilson, in\r\nfavor of the creation of a Suffrage Committee. For a long time now, the\r\nPresident had not been saying anything about the State by State method\r\nof winning Suffrage, but this was the first time that he had shown a\r\nspecific interest in the Federal Suffrage Amendment.\r\n\r\nThe meeting was open to the public, and the room was crowded. The\r\nmembers of the National American Woman Suffrage Association spoke; a\r\ngroup of Congressmen from the Suffrage States, and the following members\r\nof the Woman’s Party: Anne Martin, Maud Younger, Mrs. Richard\r\nWainwright, Mabel Vernon.\r\n\r\nMrs. Richard Wainwright said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    One of the members of the Commission from England said: “We came to\r\n    America that America may not make the mistakes that we have! One of\r\n    the mistakes that England is now trying to rectify is not giving\r\n    justice to her women. I should like the Congress of the United\r\n    States to remember what Wyoming said when asked to join the nation:\r\n    ‘We do not come in without our women.’”\r\n\r\n\r\nMiss Younger said in part:\r\n\r\n\r\n    We regard this, however (the formation of a Suffrage Committee in\r\n    the House), Mr. Chairman and gentlemen of the Committee, as only one\r\n    step toward our goal. We will not be satisfied with this alone. It\r\n    will not in any way take the place of the passage of the Amendment.\r\n    Nor are we interested in any mere record vote which might come from\r\n    the Suffrage Committee. We are working only for the passage of the\r\n    Amendment at the earliest possible date....\r\n\r\n    We ask for this measure now in war time, because the sufferings of\r\n    war fall heavily upon women. In case of an invading army the\r\n    greatest barbarities, the greatest cruelties, fall upon the women.\r\n    In this war, as never before, the burdens are borne by women.\r\n    Secretary Redfield said yesterday that three armies are necessary to\r\n    the prosecution of this war, the army in the field, the army on the\r\n    farm, and the army in the factories. In these two armies at home the\r\n    women are taking an increasingly large part and the efficiency of\r\n    their work depends largely upon the conditions under which they do\r\n    this work. In England the output of munitions was not satisfactory.\r\n    The government appointed a commission to investigate. They found\r\n    that the trouble lay in the conditions under which the women worked,\r\n    with the overlong hours. They could not get the best results under\r\n    such conditions. In America today there is an effort to break down\r\n    the protective legislation that through the years has been built up\r\n    around women and children. And so for efficiency in the war as well\r\n    as for the protection of the women, we urge Suffrage upon you now.\r\n\r\n    We do not know when this struggle may end nor to what extent the\r\n    women here may replace men. An English shipbuilder said recently\r\n    that should the war last two years longer he would build ships\r\n    entirely with women. We know that all over Europe today they are\r\n    doing men’s work, in field, in factory, and in office. When the war\r\n    is over and the armies march home, whether in victory or defeat,\r\n    they will find the women in their places. Not without a struggle\r\n    will the women give up the work, but give it up they probably will.\r\n    And then, without the means of livelihood, many of them without\r\n    husbands, with the men of their families killed in war, without the\r\n    chance to marry, to bear children, they will turn to America. We can\r\n    then look forward to an immigration of women such as this country\r\n    has never known. Before that time comes we want the power to protect\r\n    the women who are here, and to prepare to meet the new conditions\r\n    that we may not be swamped by them.\r\n\r\n    We are asking for Suffrage in war time because other nations at war\r\n    are considering it now. Over a year ago, in the Hungarian\r\n    Parliament, a deputy asked the prime minister, “When our soldiers\r\n    return from fighting our battles, will they be given the vote?” We\r\n    find men everywhere in Europe asking for Suffrage for themselves now\r\n    in war time. In Germany today the most powerful political party is\r\n    urging the vote for women as well as for men. Russia, England, and\r\n    France are on the verge of enfranchising their women. But two days\r\n    ago in the British Parliament the Under Secretary of State for the\r\n    Colonies urged the immediate passage of the Suffrage measure that\r\n    the government might not be hampered by domestic problems when, at\r\n    the end of the war, international problems will cry for settlement\r\n    and a unified nation will be needed. In the period of reconstruction\r\n    also we feel that women have something to contribute, that we may be\r\n    of help in solving the new problems which will arise from the war\r\n    and which will tax all the resources of the people. We ask you now\r\n    to release to other service the time, the energy, the money that is\r\n    being poured into the Suffrage movement.\r\n\r\n    Lastly, we urge this now that we may prove to other nations our\r\n    sincerity in wanting to establish democracy and our unselfish\r\n    motives in going into the war.\r\n\r\n    I think of that night on the 2nd of April when, from the gallery of\r\n    the House, we heard President Wilson read his war message. We were\r\n    going to war not for any gain for ourselves but to make the world\r\n    safe for democracy. We sat there and heard him read, and, gentlemen,\r\n    you applauded, “we shall fight for those things which we have always\r\n    carried nearest our hearts, for democracy, for the right of those\r\n    who submit to authority to have a voice in their own government.”\r\n    And while you applauded, some of us there in the gallery thought of\r\n    the 20,000,000 of women in our own country who “submit to authority\r\n    without a voice in their own government,” which is the President’s\r\n    definition of democracy. We thought, too, of the women of other\r\n    nations on the verge of enfranchisement themselves, and we wondered\r\n    how they would welcome the United States at the peace council, to\r\n    establish democracy for them—the United States, which does not\r\n    recognize its own women.\r\n\r\n    And we went out into the night. The Capitol looked very beautiful\r\n    and shining white against the dark sky. It seemed a great beacon\r\n    light to the nations of the world. Suddenly a dark shadow fell\r\n    across our path—the shadow of a mounted soldier. A troop of cavalry\r\n    had encircled the Capitol holding back the people. We walked down\r\n    the marble terraces and started across the Avenue. There, again, the\r\n    troop of cavalry winding down the hill blocked our progress.\r\n    Suddenly it seemed so symbolic of what war meant, the armed force,\r\n    centralized authority, blocking progress, encroaching upon the\r\n    people. And it came to us that our greatest foe is not the enemy\r\n    without but the danger to democracy within. We realized then that\r\n    the greatest service we could render today would be to fight for\r\n    democracy in this country.\r\n\r\n    We are going into this war. We will give our service, our time, our\r\n    money. We may give our lives and what is harder still, the lives of\r\n    those dear to us. We lay them all down upon the altar for the sake\r\n    of an ideal. But in laying them down let us see that the ideal for\r\n    which we sacrifice shall not perish also. Let us fight to preserve\r\n    that ideal, to make this a real democracy. And, gentlemen, the first\r\n    step toward that end lies with you here today. We ask you to take\r\n    that step and help make this nation truly a beacon light to nations\r\n    of the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough—following the hearing before the Senate Committee, on May\r\n15—the Chairman, Senator Jones of New Mexico, was unanimously instructed\r\nto make a report on the Amendment, he failed to do so. When so requested\r\nby the Woman’s Party, he refused. After three months the minority\r\n(Republican) leaders of the Committee, led by Senator Cummins of Iowa,\r\nand backed by Senator Jones of Washington and Senator Johnson of\r\nCalifornia, attempted to get the Suffrage Amendment on the Senate\r\nCalendar by discharging the Senate Suffrage Committee from its further\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nIn his own defense, Senator Jones of New Mexico pleaded lack of time and\r\ndesire to make a report that would be “a contribution to the cause.”\r\nAnother Democratic member, Senator Hollis of New Hampshire, brought\r\nforward the picketing of the Suffragists as a reason for withholding the\r\nreport. He expressed the amazing reason for not acting, his fear that\r\nthis “active group of Suffragists” would focus public attention and “get\r\ncredit.” The Chairman of the Committee who had neglected week after week\r\nto make the report which he had been authorized to make by the\r\nCommittee, was finally galvanized into action by a visit to the\r\nimprisoned pickets at Occoquan. Immediately, September 15, he made his\r\nreport to the Senate. On September 24, the creation of the House\r\nSuffrage Committee came up for heated debate in the House of\r\nRepresentatives, though its passage was a foregone conclusion. Of\r\ncourse, there was much discussion of the picketing which was still going\r\non. Many of the speakers harped on the note that this late action in\r\nregard to the creation of a committee, which the Woman’s Party had been\r\nworking for ever since 1913, would be interpreted by the country as\r\nbeing the result of the picketing. This was a quaint argument on their\r\npart, because of course, it _was_ the result of the picketing. Why else\r\nwould it have come so swiftly?\r\n\r\nDuring this discussion, Mr. Pou, the Chairman, made the following\r\nstatement:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I want to say in conclusion, Mr. Speaker, that this is no\r\n    proposition to pack the Committee for a particular purpose. The\r\n    friends of this resolution have distinctly stated time and again\r\n    that they do not expect action at this session of Congress (first\r\n    session of the Sixty-fifth Congress). The appointment of a Committee\r\n    only is asked; but after this Committee is appointed, in the next\r\n    Congress they expect to go before the people of America, and if the\r\n    returns justify, then in the Sixty-sixth Congress, they will ask for\r\n    Congressional action.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis boiled down meant of course there was no intention of passing the\r\nSuffrage Amendment before the Sixty-sixth Congress. However, the\r\nAdministration was to reverse its policy on this point less than three\r\nmonths later.\r\n\r\nThe House Suffrage Committee was created by a vote of one hundred and\r\neighty-one yeas and one hundred and seven nays.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               PART FOUR\r\n                                VICTORY\r\n\r\n                “The vast and beckoning future is ours.”\r\n                               _The Suffragist._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   I\r\n\r\n                THE NEW HEADQUARTERS AND THE LATER YEARS\r\n\r\n\r\nAT the opening of the year 1918, the Woman’s Party made another change\r\nin the location of its headquarters. It will be recalled that during the\r\nfirst part of its history, it had premises in F Street. In the middle\r\nyears, it was located at Cameron House. It was now to go directly across\r\nthe Park to 14 Jackson Place. Like Cameron House, this new mansion had\r\nhad a vivid and picturesque history. It was built by the Hon. Levi\r\nWoodbury while he was serving in the cabinet of President Jackson and\r\nPresident Van Buren. Later, it became the home of Schuyler Colfax, when\r\nhe was Vice-President. During the Civil War, Postmaster William Denison,\r\na member of Lincoln’s cabinet, lived there. And perhaps it was at this\r\nperiod that the house achieved the apex of its reputation for official\r\nhospitality. Later, it was the scene of the tragic triangle of General\r\nSickles, his beautiful young Spanish wife and the brilliant Barton Key.\r\nStill later it fell into the hands of Mrs. Washington McLean, and then\r\nof her grandson’s family—the Bughers. Then it was turned into the Home\r\nClub.\r\n\r\nIt is a charming house. The façade is a pleasing combination of\r\ncream-colored tiling trimmed with white. Immediately, of course, the\r\nWoman’s Party adorned that delicate, lustrous expanse with the red,\r\nwhite, and blue of the big national banner, which always flies over\r\ntheir Headquarters, and the purple, white, and gold of the equally big\r\nParty tri-color. Later, in the little oval made by the porte-cochère,\r\nthey erected a bulletin board presented by Mrs. O. H. P. Belmont. By\r\nthis means the casual passer-by was kept informed, by bulletin and by\r\nphotographs, of the activities of the Woman’s Party.\r\n\r\nInside there are rooms and rooms, rooms big and small, rooms of all\r\nsizes and heights. A spacious ball-room on the second floor with a\r\nseating capacity of three hundred, was of course of great practical\r\nadvantage to the Party. The other rooms on this floor were made into\r\noffices; the rooms on the floor above into bedrooms. Mrs. Lawrence Lewis\r\nand Mrs. William Kent raised the money for the maintenance of this huge\r\nestablishment.\r\n\r\nAlice Paul, always economically inclined where expenditure is not\r\nabsolutely necessary, immediately asked for contributions of\r\nfurnishings. All kinds of things were given of course, from pianos to\r\nkitchen pans. From Mrs. Pflaster of Virginia came a load of heirlooms,\r\nin various colonial patterns—furniture which makes the connoisseur\r\npositively gasp. Chairs of the Hepplewhite and Sheraton periods; tables\r\nmade by Phyffe; tables in the most graceful style of Empire furniture;\r\nmahogany cabinets, delicately inlaid—they gave the place an\r\nextraordinary atmosphere. Huge, dim, old-gold-framed mirrors and a few\r\nfine old paintings reinforced the effect.\r\n\r\nAlice Paul’s office, which is on the second floor, was done in purple\r\nand gold; the woodwork of gold, the furniture upholstered in purple\r\nvelvet.\r\n\r\nLater, a large room, originally a stable at the rear of the first floor,\r\nwas transformed into a tea-room. Vivian Pierce had charge of the\r\ndecorations here; and she made it very attractive. The brick walls were\r\npainted yellow, the tables and chairs black. The windows and doors were\r\nall enclosed in flat frames of brilliant chintz, of which the background\r\nwas black, but the dominating note blue. The many hanging lights were\r\nswathed in yellow silk. The tea-room rapidly became very popular in\r\nWashington; and, as rapidly, became one of the most interesting places\r\nin the city. Visitors of many distinguished kinds came there in\r\npreference to the larger restaurants or hotels. They knew the members of\r\nthe Woman’s Party who lived in the house, and they gradually came to\r\nknow the habitués of the tea-room. At meals, separated parties were\r\nalways coalescing into one big party. People wandered from table to\r\ntable. There was an air of comradeship and sympathy. Afterwards, groups\r\noften went up the little flight of stairs which leads to the ball-room,\r\nand sitting before the fire in the huge fireplace, drank their\r\nafter-dinner coffee together. These talks sometimes lasted until\r\nmidnight.\r\n\r\nAs for the atmosphere of the place itself—it can be summed up by only\r\none word, and that word is—youth. Not that everybody who came to\r\nHeadquarters was—as years go—young. There were, for instance, Lavinia\r\nDock who was sixty, Mary Nolan who was seventy, and the Rev. Olympia\r\nBrown who was an octogenarian. Of course, though, when one considers\r\nthat the Rev. Olympia Brown took part in that rain-drenched and\r\nwind-driven picket deputation of a thousand women on March 4, and that\r\nMary Nolan and Lavinia Dock both served their terms in prison, one must\r\nadmit that they were as young in spirit as the youngest picket there.\r\nBut young pickets were there—I mean, young in actual years; young and\r\nfresh and gay; able and daring. Alice Paul, herself, whimsically relates\r\nwhat an obstacle their very youth seemed to them during the early part\r\nof the movement. When first they began to wage their warfare on the\r\nDemocratic Party, old Suffragists rebuked them; and rebuked them always\r\non the score that they were too young to know any better. “How hard we\r\ntried to seem old,” Alice Paul said. “On all occasions we pushed elderly\r\nones into the foreground and when Mrs. Lawrence Lewis became a\r\ngrandmother, how triumphant we were. Oh, we encouraged grandmotherhood\r\nin those days.” But now—triumphantly successful—they were no longer\r\nafraid of their own youth. They knew it was their greatest asset. They\r\nmade the place ring with its gaiety. They made it seethe with its\r\nactivity. They made it rock with its resolution. “The young are at the\r\ngates!” said Lavinia Dock. And these were young who would not brook\r\ndenial of their demands.\r\n\r\nAs you entered Headquarters, that breath of youth struck you in the face\r\nwith its wild, fresh sweetness. It was as pungent as a wind blowing over\r\nspring flowers. It was as vivid as the flash of spring clouds hurrying\r\nover the new blue of the sky. In actuality, youthful activity rang from\r\nevery corner of the house. In the white entrance hall, a young girl sat\r\nat the switchboard; and she was always a very busy person. To the left\r\nwas the Press Headquarters, full of that mad turmoil which, seemingly,\r\nis inevitable to any Press activity. Upstairs, Alice Paul was always\r\ninterviewing or being interviewed; reading letters or answering them;\r\nasking questions or giving information; snatching a hurried meal from a\r\ntray; dictating all manner of business; or giving the last orders before\r\nshe darted east, west, north, or south. She was sure to be doing one of\r\nthese things, or some of them, or—this really seems not an\r\nexaggeration—all of them.\r\n\r\nAll about and from the offices that ran beside the ball-room sounded the\r\nclick of typewriters—some one counted twenty-four typewriters in the\r\nhouse once. Everywhere, you ran into busy, business-like stenographers\r\nwith papers in their hands, proceeding from one office to another. If it\r\nwere lunch time, or dinner time, pairs of young girls, with their arms\r\naround each other’s waists, chattering busily, were making their way to\r\nthe tea-room. At night, the big ball-room was filled with groups reading\r\nmagazines at the big (and priceless) tables; or talking over the events\r\nof the day ... Congress ... the picketing. Late at night, the\r\ndiscussions still went on. Upstairs, they followed each other from\r\nbedroom to bedroom, still arguing, still comparing notes, still making\r\nsuggestions in regard to a hundred things: organizing, lobbying,\r\npersonal appeal to political leaders, et caetera, ad infinitum. The\r\nhuge, four-poster bed—big enough for royalty—in Mrs. Lawrence Lewis’s\r\nroom was the scene—with ardent pickets sitting all over it—of many a\r\ndiscussion that threatened to prolong itself until dawn.\r\n\r\nAnd all day long, and all evening long—any time—organizers with their\r\nharvests of facts and ideas were likely to appear from the remotest\r\nparts of the country. Young, enthusiastic, unconscious of bodily\r\ndiscomfort, if the beds were all full, they pulled a mattress onto the\r\nfloor and slept there or curled up on a couch—anything so long as they\r\ncould stay at the friendly, welcoming Headquarters. To middle age, it\r\nwas all a revelation of the unsounded, unplumbed depths of endurance in\r\nconvinced, emancipate, determined youth. There was no end to their\r\nstrength apparently. Apparently there was no possibility of palling\r\ntheir spirit. Arriving at nine at night from Oregon, they would depart\r\nblithely the next morning at six for Alabama. To those women who had the\r\nprivilege of taking part, either as active participants, or enthralled\r\nlookers-on, this will always stand out as one of their most thrilling\r\nlife experiences. Katherine Rolston Fisher’s fine descriptive phrase in\r\nregard to it all inevitably recurs: “It was,” she says, “the renaissance\r\nof the Suffrage movement.”\r\n\r\nSpeed was their animating force: “The Suffrage Amendment passed at\r\nonce,” their eternal motto.\r\n\r\nIn the nomenclature of the Great War, the pickets were the shock troops\r\nof the Suffrage forces. They took the first line trenches. The forces of\r\nthe organization back of them secured and maintained these positions;\r\nheld those trenches until the time came for the next advance. As for the\r\norganizers working all over the country, they were the air force\r\nand—still using the nomenclature of that great struggle—they were like\r\nthe little, swift, quickly-turning chase-planes which so effectually\r\nharassed the huge enemy machines.\r\n\r\nThe Woman’s Party never grew so big nor its organization so cumbrous\r\nthat its object was defeated by numbers and weight. It was distinguished\r\nalways by quality rather than quantity, and its mechanical organization\r\nwas sensitive and light. It lay over its members as delicately as a\r\ncobweb on the grass; and it responded as instantly as a cobweb to the\r\ntouch of changing conditions. News from Washington went to the uttermost\r\nparts of the country as swiftly as electricity could bear it. The\r\nresults in action were equally swift. That was because youth was\r\neverywhere, not only youth of body, but, perhaps more important, youth\r\nof spirit. Senators and Representatives frequently marveled at the power\r\nand strength of an organization which had come to fruition in so few\r\nyears. Had they all visited Headquarters—as some of them did—I think\r\nthat all would have understood.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   II\r\n\r\n                                LOBBYING\r\n\r\n\r\nI HAVE left until now all consideration of a department which had been,\r\nalmost from the very beginning, of great importance to the Woman’s\r\nParty; the most important department of all; the crux of its work; a\r\ndepartment which steadily augmented in importance—the lobbying.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment in 1912 that the Suffragists started their work in\r\nWashington, relations had to be established with the House and the\r\nSenate. At first, tentative, a little wavering, irregular, the lobbying\r\nbecame finally astute, intensive, and constant. The lobby grew in\r\nnumbers. After the Congressional Committee had become the Congressional\r\nUnion, and had separated from the National American Woman Suffrage\r\nAssociation, the latter body sent its own lobbyists to Washington. The\r\nanti-Suffragists sent lobbyists too. By 1914, the stream had grown to a\r\nflood. The halls of Congress were never free from this invasion. The\r\nsiege lasted without cessation as long as a Congress was in session.\r\n“This place looks like a millinery establishment,” a Congressman said\r\nonce.\r\n\r\nIn the early days, the reception of the lobbyists at the hands of\r\nCongressmen lacked by many degrees that graciousness of which, at the\r\nvery end, they were almost certain. A story of this early period taken\r\nfrom the Woman’s Party card-index, is most illuminating.\r\n\r\nTwo Suffrage lobbyists were calling on Hoke Smith. “As you are\r\nSuffragists,” Mr. Smith said, “you won’t mind standing.” He himself sat,\r\nlounging comfortably in his chair. He took out a big cigar, inserted it\r\nin his mouth, lighted it. The two women said what they had to say,\r\nstanding, while Mr. Smith smoked contemptuously on.\r\n\r\nThose two women were Emily Perry and Jeannette Rankin.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe lobbying for the Woman’s Party was directed at first by Alice Paul\r\nand Lucy Burns. Mrs. Gilson Gardner was the pioneer lobbyist, and the\r\nfirst-year lobbyists were all women voters. They made reports to Alice\r\nPaul and Lucy Burns every day. First these were oral; later they were\r\nwritten. This was the nucleus of the Woman’s Party card catalogue which\r\nhas since become so famous. Finally, these written reports were put in\r\ntabulated form by Mrs. Grimes of Michigan.\r\n\r\nAs the work grew, unenfranchised women lobbied as often as enfranchised.\r\nThe early lobbyists were: Mrs. Gilson Gardner, Mrs. William Kent, Mrs.\r\nGeorge Odell, Lucy Burns, Abby Scott Baker, Mrs. Lowell Mellett. But not\r\nonly the experienced lobbied. As has before been set down—following that\r\nwise instinct which impelled Alice Paul to give her workers glimpses of\r\nall phases of the movement—as fast as the organizers came back to\r\nWashington, she sent them up to the galleries of Congress to listen; she\r\nmade them lobby for a while. And, as has elsewhere been stated, this was\r\nfound to be a mutual benefit. Organizers took the temper and atmosphere\r\nof Congress back to the States, and sometimes to the very constituents\r\nof the Congressmen with whom they had talked; they put Congressmen in\r\ntouch with what was happening at home. Whenever a woman visiting\r\nWashington called at Headquarters, Alice Paul immediately sent her to\r\nthe Capitol to lobby the Congressmen and Senators of her own State.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1915, Anne Martin, as Chairman of the Legislative\r\nDepartment, became the head of the lobbying. Miss Martin is a born\r\ngeneral. She brought to this situation an instinct for the strategy and\r\ntactics of politics. She supervised the work of those who were under\r\nher, sent them up to Congress with specific directions; received their\r\nreports; collated them; made suggestions for the next day’s work;\r\ndeveloped a closer relation with the constituents and kept local\r\nchairmen in touch with the States of their own Congressmen and Senators.\r\nIn 1916, Anne Martin ran for Senator in Nevada. She had of necessity to\r\nrelinquish active work in Washington for the Woman’s Party.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1916, therefore, Maud Younger who was in a position to\r\ngive her whole time to it, became Chairman of the Lobby Committee and\r\nchief lobbyist for the Amendment.\r\n\r\nAt all times this work was hard, and sometimes intensely disagreeable.\r\nMaud Younger in her _Revelations of a Woman Lobbyist_, gives some of the\r\nactual physical strain. She says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The path of the lobbyist is a path of white marble. And white\r\n    marble, though beautiful, is hard. The House office building runs\r\n    around four sides of a block, so that when you have walked around\r\n    one floor, you have walked four blocks on white marble. When you\r\n    have walked around each of the five floors you have walked a mile on\r\n    white marble. When you have gone this morning and afternoon through\r\n    several sessions of Congress you have walked more weary miles on\r\n    white marble than a lobbyist has time to count.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the Woman’s Party lobbyists were not balked by the mere matter of\r\nwhite marble. In a week they were threading that interminable intricate\r\nmaze of Congressional alleys with the light, swift step of familiarity\r\nand of determination. All day long, they drove from the Visitors’\r\nReception Room to Senatorial offices, and from Senatorial offices back\r\nto the Visitors’ Reception Room. They flew up and down in the elevators.\r\nThey found unknown and secret stairways by which they made short cuts.\r\nThey journeyed back and forth in the little underground subway which\r\ntries to mitigate these long distances. At first Congressmen frankly\r\ntook to hiding, and the lobbyist discovered that the Capitol was a nest\r\nof _abris_, but in the end, even Congressmen could not elude the\r\nvigilance of youth and determination. As for the mental and spiritual\r\ndifficulties of the task—at first, Senators and Congressmen were frankly\r\nuninterested, or, more concretely, irritated and enraged with the\r\nSuffrage lobbyists. It is not pleasant to have to talk to a man who does\r\nnot want to hear you. The lobbyists had to learn to be quiet;\r\ndeferential; to listen to long intervals of complaint and abuse; to seem\r\nnot to notice rebuffs; to go back the next day as though the rebuff had\r\nnot occurred. This is not easy to women of spirit. Perhaps it could not\r\nhave been borne, if it had not been a labor of love. Many times these\r\nwomen had to bolster a smarting sense of humiliation by keeping the\r\nthought of victory in sight.\r\n\r\nIn her _Revelations of a Woman Lobbyist_, Maud Younger tells\r\ninterestingly and with a very arch touch some of these experiences:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Mr. Huddleston, the thin, blonde type of Congressman, sat at his\r\n    desk in his low-ceilinged, well-lighted office.\r\n\r\n    “What is it?” he greeted me when I entered. His manner was very\r\n    brusque, but I refused to be repelled by it. I began to speak.\r\n\r\n    “There’s always some one hippodroming around here with some kind of\r\n    propaganda,” he snapped, interrupting. “We’re very busy, we’ve got\r\n    important things to do, we can’t be bothered with Woman Suffrage.”\r\n    He made a jerky motion, rattling the papers on his desk, and turning\r\n    his head to look through the window. I thought of several things to\r\n    say to Mr. Huddleston, but this was obviously the time to say none\r\n    of them. So I murmured, “Thank you,” and withdrew....\r\n\r\n    Mr. Whaley’s face is red; his head is prematurely gray outside and\r\n    his thoughts prematurely gray inside. “We don’t need women voting in\r\n    South Carolina,” he said with a large masculine manner. “We know how\r\n    to take care of our women in our State. We don’t allow divorce for\r\n    any reason whatever.”\r\n\r\n    He was continuing with expressed contempt for Suffrage and implied\r\n    contempt for Suffragists, when the door opened and a negro,\r\n    evidently a clergyman, entered.\r\n\r\n    “Get out of here!” said Mr. Whaley. “You stand in the hall till\r\n    you’re called.” As the negro hastily retreated, Mr. Whaley turned to\r\n    me and said with pride, “That’s the way to treat ’em.”...\r\n\r\n    A few minutes later, I opened Mr. Sisson’s door and saw him, very\r\n    large and rugged, standing with some letters in his hand and\r\n    dictating to a stenographer.\r\n\r\n    “I can’t discuss that subject,” he interrupted at my first words,\r\n    and then he discussed it at length. He had meant that I was not to\r\n    discuss it. He spoke of women in the kitchen, in the nursery, in the\r\n    parlor. He spoke of her tenderness, her charm, her need for shelter\r\n    and kindness. Wearily shifting from one foot to the other, I\r\n    listened. At last I opened my mouth to speak, but he silenced me\r\n    with a brusque gesture.\r\n\r\n    “The reason I’m so lenient with you,” he explained—for he had\r\n    allowed me to stand and listen to him—“is because you’re a woman. If\r\n    you were a man——” He left the end of the sentence in dark doubt.\r\n    What would he have done to a man standing dumbly in my place,\r\n    holding tight to a muff? I shall never know. Discretion did not\r\n    allow me to ask him.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Reed sat at his mahogany desk—a large, rather good-looking\r\n    Senator, with gray hair. His record in our card-index read: “He is\r\n    most reactionary, not to say antediluvian.” So I was not surprised\r\n    to hear him say slowly and solemnly:\r\n\r\n    “Women don’t know anything about politics. Did you ever hear them\r\n    talking together? Well, first they talk about fashions, and\r\n    children, and housework; and then, perhaps about churches; and then\r\n    perhaps—about theatres; and then perhaps——” At each “perhaps,” he\r\n    gazed down at his finger-tips where his ideas appeared to originate,\r\n    looking up at me at each new point. “And then, perhaps—about\r\n    literatoor!” he ended triumphantly. “Yes, and that is the way it\r\n    ought to be,” he added, satisfied.\r\n\r\n    “But don’t you believe that voting might make women think?”\r\n\r\n    At this suggestion he recoiled, then recovered and grew jocose.\r\n\r\n    “Do you think I want my wife working against my interests? That’s\r\n    just what she’d be doing—voting against me. Women can’t understand\r\n    politics.”\r\n\r\n    I began to tell him about California women voters, but he\r\n    interrupted. “Women wouldn’t change things if they did vote. They’d\r\n    all vote just like their husbands.”\r\n\r\n\r\nSometimes they said to Miss Younger, “If you were a voter——”\r\n\r\n“But I am a voter,” Miss Younger, who is from California, would reply.\r\n\r\nTheir attitude invariably changed.\r\n\r\nMiss Younger comments: “They _said_ they respected femininity, but it\r\nwas plain that they _did_ respect a voter.”\r\n\r\nIt was hard, hard work.\r\n\r\nThe lobbying was immensely more detailed and complicated than an\r\noutsider would ever suspect. All the time, of course, they were working\r\nfor the passing of the Anthony Amendment. That was their great\r\nobjective, but, as in all warfare, the campaign for the great objective\r\nwas divided into many tiny campaigns. At the beginning of the\r\nCongressional Union work in Washington, for instance, they lobbied\r\nSenators and Representatives to march in the big parade of March 3,\r\n1913. Later they lobbied them to go to mass-meetings, to attend\r\nconventions. In 1916, when they were having such difficulty with the\r\nJudiciary Committee, they lobbied Republicans and Democratic members of\r\nthat Committee to get them to act. By a follow-up system, they sent\r\nother lobbyists in a few days to see if they had acted. When the\r\nSuffrage Envoys came back from the West, they lobbied Congressmen to\r\nreceive them. In the Presidential election of 1916, they lobbied\r\nCongress first to get Suffrage planks in both Party platforms and when\r\nthese planks proved unsatisfactory, they lobbied the Republican\r\nSuffragists in Congress to get Hughes to come out for the Federal\r\nAmendment and when Hughes came out for it, they lobbied the Democratic\r\nCongressmen to get the President to come out for it. When the Special\r\nWar Session met, in April, 1917, fifty Woman’s Party lobbyists lobbied\r\nCongress—covering it in a month. When the Irish Mission visited\r\nCongress, and two hundred and fifty voted for the freedom of Ireland,\r\nthey lobbied these Congressmen to vote for the freedom of women. When\r\nthe arrests of the pickets began, they lobbied their Congressmen to go\r\nto see their constituents in jail. The Woman’s Party kept track of how\r\nCongressmen voted on different measures and wherever it was possible,\r\nthey linked it up with Suffrage. To the Congressmen who voted against\r\nwar, they sent lobbyists who could show what an influence for peace the\r\nwomen could be. To those who voted for war, they sent the women, who\r\nwere war workers, to show how women could work for war.\r\n\r\nBefore the six years’ campaign of the Woman’s Party was over, the\r\nRepublicans were sometimes sending Congressmen of one State to convert\r\nthe unconverted ones of another, and, in the end, the young Democratic\r\nSenators had actually appointed a committee to get Suffrage votes from\r\ntheir older confrères. After Congress passed the Amendment, they lobbied\r\nthe Congressmen to write the governors to call special sessions of the\r\nLegislature in the interests of ratification; then they lobbied them to\r\nwrite the Legislators; then they lobbied them to write political\r\nleaders.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the hardest interval in their work was that which followed the\r\ncampaign of 1916. Wilson had been elected again on the slogan, “He kept\r\nus out of war.” The Republicans did not want to hear anything about the\r\nwomen voters of the West. The Woman’s Party lobbyists, who were often\r\nmore informed on the Republican situation in parts of the West than were\r\nthe Republicans themselves, had to educate them. They had to show them\r\nhow remiss the Republicans themselves had been during that campaign, how\r\nHughes for instance came out for Suffrage in the East, where women did\r\nnot vote, and never mentioned it in the West, where they did. It was not\r\neasy work. Sometimes Congressmen would take up papers or letters and\r\nexamine them, while the lobbyist was talking. Nevertheless, she would\r\ncontinue. And then, inevitably the degree of her information, her clear\r\nand forceful exposition of the situation, would arouse interest. Often\r\nin the end, the erstwhile indifferent Congressman would shake hands and\r\nbow her out.\r\n\r\nAs to the mechanics of lobbying work, perhaps nothing is more\r\ninteresting than the cards themselves of the famous card-index.\r\n\r\n\r\n    No. 1—Contains the member’s name and his biography as contained in\r\n    the Congressional Directory.\r\n\r\n    No. 2—A key card has these headings:\r\n\r\n    Ancestry, Nativity, Education, Religion, Offices Held, General\r\n    Information.\r\n\r\n    No. 3—A sub-card under the foregoing, as are those yet to be given,\r\n    contains these headings: Birth, Date, Place, Number of Children,\r\n    Additional Information.\r\n\r\n    Nos. 4, 5, and 6—Are respectively for Father, Mother, Brothers. They\r\n    have headings to elicit full information on these subjects, as\r\n    Nativity, Education, Occupation.\r\n\r\n    No. 7—Education: Preparatory School and College.\r\n\r\n    No. 8—Religion: Name of Church, Date of Entrance, Position Held in\r\n    Church, Church Work.\r\n\r\n    No. 9—Military Service: Dates, Offices, Battles, Additional\r\n    Information.\r\n\r\n    No. 10—Occupation: Past, Present.\r\n\r\n    No. 11—Labor Record.\r\n\r\n    Nos. 12 and 13—Are set aside for Literary Work and Lecture Work.\r\n\r\n    No. 14—Newspapers: Meaning what newspapers the member reads and\r\n    those that have the most influence over him.\r\n\r\n    Nos. 15 and 16—Are respectively for Recreation and Hobbies.\r\n\r\n    Nos. 17 and 18—Are devoted to Health and Habits.\r\n\r\n    No. 19—Political Life Prior to Congress: Offices Held. Whether\r\n    Supported Prohibition Amendment, Offices Run For.\r\n\r\n    No. 20—Political life in Congress: Terms, Date, Party, Bills\r\n    Introduced, Bills Supported, Committees.\r\n\r\n    No. 21—Suffrage Record: Outside of Congress, In Congress.\r\n\r\n    No. 22—Votes cast in Election of Member.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn an interview in the _New York Times_ of March 2, 1919, Miss Younger\r\ndescribes the working of this system.\r\n\r\n\r\n    If a Congressman said to a lobbyist, for instance, “I do not think\r\n    my district is much interested in Woman Suffrage, I get very few\r\n    letters in favor of it from my constituents,” then, immediately, by\r\n    means of the information gained through the card-index, a flood of\r\n    pro-Suffrage letters would descend upon him. Always, as far as\r\n    possible, these letters would come from people he knew or who were\r\n    influential.\r\n\r\n    If a Congressman had a financial backer, they tried to get at him.\r\n    If he were from a strong labor district, they appealed to Labor to\r\n    bring its influence to bear upon him.\r\n\r\n    When the lobbyist started for Congress, she was given a lobbying\r\n    slip which had a list of entries printed on it. For instance, one\r\n    heading was “Exact statements and remarks.” Miss Younger told me of\r\n    one Congressman who said to her: “Put me down on the mourners’\r\n    bench. I am thinking about it.” Immediately Headquarters became very\r\n    busy with this Congressman.\r\n\r\n    Another said, “Women in my State do not want it.” Miss Younger,\r\n    commenting on that, said that it was always an encouraging case. We\r\n    see immediately that he gets shoals of letters and telegrams from\r\n    his State. One Congressman on whom such a campaign was waged said\r\n    finally: “If you will only stop, I will vote for the Amendment. It\r\n    keeps my office force busy all day answering letters about Suffrage\r\n    alone.”\r\n\r\n    The hardest Congressmen to deal with were those who said, “I will\r\n    not vote for it if every voter in my State asks me.” To such a one,\r\n    we would send a woman from his own district. In one case, the\r\n    Congressman was so rude to her that she came back to Headquarters,\r\n    subscribed a hundred dollars to our funds, departed, and became a\r\n    staunch Suffragist. We kept a list of men of this type and we sent\r\n    to them any woman who was wavering on Suffrage. It never failed to\r\n    make her a strong Suffragist.\r\n\r\n    Any bit of information on these cards might be used. If a man played\r\n    golf, that might be a happy moment for a member of the Woman’s Party\r\n    to talk Suffrage with him. If he had the kind of mother who was an\r\n    influence in his life, they tried to convert the mother. If it was\r\n    the wife who was the ruling influence, they tried to convert the\r\n    wife. They were careful even in regard to brothers. The habits of\r\n    Congressmen as disclosed by this index were of great importance.\r\n    Some of them got to their office early, and that was often the best\r\n    time to speak with them. If a Congressman drank, it was necessary to\r\n    note that. Then when the lobbyists found him muddled and\r\n    inarticulate, they knew to what to impute it.\r\n\r\n    Of course information of a blackmailing order was occasionally\r\n    offered from outside sources to the Woman’s Party, but, of course,\r\n    this was always ignored.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom 1916 on, the years in which Maud Younger was in charge of the lobby\r\ncommittee, twenty-two Senators changed their position in favor of\r\nSuffrage.\r\n\r\nI have said that it was difficult for a Congressman to elude these swift\r\nand determined scouts of the Woman’s Party. But harder still was it to\r\nelude a something, an unknown quality—an x—which had come into the\r\nfourth generation of women to demand enfranchisement. That quality was\r\npolitical-mindedness. Congressmen had undoubtedly before run the gamut\r\nof feminine persuasiveness; grace; charm; tact. But here was an army of\r\nyoung Amazons who looked them straight in the eye, who were absolutely\r\ninformed, who knew their rights, who were not to be frightened by\r\nbluster, put off by rudeness, or thwarted either by delay or political\r\ntrickery. They never lost their tempers and they never gave up. They\r\nnever took “No” for an answer. They were young and they believed they\r\ncould do the impossible. And believing it, they accomplished it. Before\r\nthe six years and a half of campaign of the Woman’s Party was over,\r\nCongressman after Congressman, Senator after Senator paid tribute—often\r\na grudged one—to the verve and _élan_ of that campaign.\r\n\r\nBut though they talked man fashion, eye to eye, the lobbyists, when\r\nreturned to Headquarters, were full of excellent information and\r\nsuggestions and all that mysterious by-product which comes from feminine\r\nintuition.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  III\r\n\r\n                               ORGANIZING\r\n\r\n\r\nALTHOUGH it is impossible to do justice to any department of the\r\nNational Woman’s Party, it seems particularly difficult in the case of\r\nthe organizers. The reason for this is not far to seek. These young\r\nwomen were turned loose, sometimes quite inexperienced; sometimes only\r\none to a State, with the injunction to come back with their shield or on\r\nit. They always came back with their shield—that is to say an\r\norganization of some sort in the State they had just left. As has been\r\nbefore stated, the National Woman’s Party has organized in every State\r\nin the Union at some time during its history—that is between the years\r\n1912 and 1919. As has also been stated, the organizers divided into\r\nthree groups—those who worked in the first two years; those who worked\r\nin the middle two; those who worked in the last two.\r\n\r\nIt has been shown with what careful instruction Alice Paul sent these\r\nyoung adventurers into the wide wide world of unorganized States; but\r\nperhaps justice has not been done to the trust she placed in them and\r\nthe consequent extraordinary results. She kept in close telegraphic\r\ncommunication with them all the time—and yet always, she left them free\r\nto make big decisions and sudden changes in policy. “She made us feel\r\nthat we could do it in the first place,” one of them said to me, “and\r\nsomehow we did. That sense we had of her—brooding and hovering back\r\nthere in Washington—always gave us courage; always gave us the physical\r\nstrength to do the things we did and the mental strength to make the\r\ndecisions we made.”\r\n\r\nAs one looks through the lists of these three groups of organizers, one\r\nis astounded at the various kinds of work they did; their versatility.\r\nMabel Vernon for instance. Her activities form an integral part of the\r\nWoman’s Party history. Mabel Vernon traveling ahead of Sara Bard Field\r\nin her spectacular automobile trip across the country, was more\r\nresponsible than anybody, except Mrs. Field herself, for the success of\r\nthat trip. Mabel Vernon challenged the President in the course of his\r\nspeech at the laying of the corner-stone of the new Headquarters of the\r\nAmerican Federation of Labor in Washington. Mabel Vernon was one of the\r\nwomen who dropped the banner in the Senate when the President came to\r\nspeak before them. Mabel Vernon picketed and went to jail. Mabel Vernon\r\n_seems_ to have organized or spoken in every State in the Union.\r\n\r\nElsie Hill, Doris Stevens—you find them everywhere, luminous spirits\r\nwith a new modern adjunct of political-mindedness. Abby Scott Baker was\r\nalways on the wing.\r\n\r\nOne’s mind stops at the names of Vivian Pierce, Lucy Branham, Mary\r\nGertrude Fendall, Hazel Hunkins. How many and what varying and difficult\r\nthings they did! Vivian Pierce in addition to speaking and organizing\r\nand picketing activities, edited the _Suffragist_, and designed the\r\ncharming tea-room at Headquarters. As for Lucy Branham—she must have\r\nseemed a stormy petrel to all opposing forces—she had so much the\r\ncapacity of being everywhere at once.\r\n\r\nWhen one comes to the last group, a sense—almost of awe—is leavened by a\r\ndecided sense of amusement. Julia Emory, Betty Gram, Anita Pollitzer,\r\nMary Dubrow, Catherine Flanagan are all _little_ girls. But in Suffrage\r\nwork, they were active, insistent, and persistent in inverse ratio to\r\ntheir size. In ratification, that legislature was doomed on which any\r\ntwo of them descended.\r\n\r\nWhat they accomplished! Once Alice Paul turned Anita Pollitzer loose on\r\nthe entire State of Wyoming and Anita Pollitzer brought Wyoming into\r\ncamp. It is impossible to do justice to all of them, to any of them. But\r\nas an example of how they worked, I am quoting from letters written by\r\nAnita Pollitzer describing various experiences in her work of\r\norganization. I use Miss Pollitzer’s letters, not because they are\r\nexceptional but because they are typical. Space will not permit me to do\r\nequal justice to any of the others. But perhaps some day all those\r\nmarvelous narratives will be collected. Miss Pollitzer writes me as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n                                Wyoming\r\n\r\n“Campaign against the party in power”—late October, 1918—snow on the\r\nground and no friends in the State—traveled miles to get help of most\r\ninfluential woman, found her lying on the floor of a church with brass\r\ntacks and a hammer—She said she was “chairman of the committee on laying\r\ncarpets in the church,” and that was all she could undertake.\r\n\r\nCheyenne wonderfully beautiful—plains—most exceptional place for\r\ncampaign purposes—forty minutes between street cars—snow miles high and\r\nevery woman demanding a separate visit. Influenza epidemic so bad that\r\nit was considered immoral for six women to meet in a parlor—only way was\r\nto campaign by dodgers and street signs—Got permission from owner of\r\nbuilding to put a forty-foot purple, white, and gold sign, suspended it\r\nfrom the most prominent building—Town literally gathered in groups to\r\nsee it—I got up next morning at seven and sign was down—I had\r\n“antagonized”—so I went to call on the Mayor and we toured the town, and\r\nrehung the sign on an even more important street, and I had double\r\npublicity, the Mayor taking full responsibility for the sign even\r\ninquiring if it would “run in the rain.”\r\n\r\nSuch fearful snow, could get no billboard men to put up my big paper\r\nsigns outside of the cities, and I wanted them on cross-country roads. I\r\nmet a woman delivering newspapers, explained our campaign and my\r\ndifficulties, and she offered us her eighteen-year-old daughter and a\r\nbox of stickers, and we tramped the automobile roads and papered the\r\ntree trunks—Posters.\r\n\r\nThis is my first National Woman’s Party trip. Wyoming a real\r\nadventure—South where I have always lived (Charleston, South Carolina)\r\nso utterly unlike—When I went out to mail my thousands of circular\r\nletters each night at two A.M. funny Filipino bell boys and other kinds\r\nwould escort me and carry the thousands of circular letters to mail box.\r\nLocal post-office _really_ asked me to be “more considerate.”\r\n\r\n                             South Carolina\r\n\r\nGetting Senator Pollock’s vote seemed largely a question of getting the\r\nfarmers of South Carolina. If Pollock (the Progressive) was to beat\r\nSenator Smith (the Reactionary) he must please the farm element.\r\n\r\nSo I journeyed out to Mayesville—arrived on hog-killing day—at the house\r\nof Dabs—impressive person, leading farmer of South Carolina. We ate all\r\nday, and sat around a glorious fire, and in the afternoon Mr. Dabs wrote\r\na letter that he gave me to take to town to mail that helped more than\r\nwe’ll ever know. In the letter Dabs spoke for the farmers, urged Pollock\r\nto declare for the Suffrage Amendment, and ended, “We farmers are doing\r\nlittle talking but a lot of thinking.”\r\n\r\nI always believed if Pollock voted, he would vote “Yes.” But Mrs.\r\nWilliam P. Vaughan of Greenville, our State Chairman, and I tramped the\r\nState up and down, saying, “There’ll be no vote—unless Pollock\r\ndeclares.”\r\n\r\nFinally one night Senator Pollock’s secretary appeared at my hotel in\r\nColumbia, and he said, “Don’t say again that Pollock is defeating\r\nSuffrage by delay.” I said, “Well, then, get him to declare.” He said,\r\n“I’m going to Washington, going tomorrow. Good night. We will have a\r\nsurprise for you within a week—within three days.” And at once, after\r\nweeks and weeks of campaigning, Senator Pollock of South Carolina broke\r\nthe Conservative record of his State, declared “Yes,” and voted “Yes,”\r\non the freedom of American women.\r\n\r\nWhen it was all over—his vote and our campaign to get him to declare—I\r\ncame back to Washington, had lunch with him at the Capitol, and sat,\r\nwhile he told me of the numerous people in South Carolina who had asked\r\nhim to vote “Yes!” “You’ll never know the sentiment that exists in South\r\nCarolina,” was all he said. But I felt we knew.\r\n\r\n                                Florida\r\n\r\nGetting the South Florida Press Association at its annual meeting to\r\nendorse the Federal Suffrage Amendment was marvelous fun—I learned that\r\nSenator Trammell had gotten solid support from two counties, and owed\r\nthis support to a man named Goolsby—editor. So I hired a car and made\r\nfor Goolsby. He is a very powerful newspaper man. We sat around a log\r\nfire, with the wife, a parrot, and a cat, and finally he said he was\r\ngoing in two days to a meeting of the South Florida Press Association,\r\nand that he was President. I said, “I’m going too.” He said, “Well,\r\nthere’s hope while there’s life—they’re against you, but you can try.” I\r\nfelt that we could do it, talked it all over with him, and said that I\r\nwould be down to put the resolution in regardless of the results—but\r\nthat I knew it could pass.\r\n\r\nTwo days seemed like years. At daybreak—five—I climbed in a Ford and\r\narrived at the Press Conference at ten. Goolsby was the only one I knew.\r\nHe introduced me to the Resolutions Committee. I sat through speeches\r\nand speeches. At noon came a luncheon. The Chairman of the Resolutions\r\nCommittee took me to that. Then an auto ride all through the orange\r\ngroves—we got out and picked them, talking Suffrage all the while. Only\r\nthe Resolutions Committee and I were in the car. The Chairman of the\r\nCommittee finally said out of a clear sky to the elderly gentleman at my\r\nleft—a strong anti—“I believe we ought to pass a resolution or\r\nsomething, don’t you, thanking Miss Pollitzer for coming?”—all in joke.\r\nI said: “No, but you ought to pass a resolution urging your own Florida\r\nSenators to stand behind President Wilson. They’re not.” He said, “They\r\nshould.” I said, “Well, let’s pass it.” So in the car, speeding along,\r\nthanks to the marvelously smooth roads and my luncheon friend—we wrote\r\nthe resolution. The old editor said, “What? Suffrage!” My young one\r\nsaid, “Yes; Suffrage; standing back of President Wilson.” When we got\r\nback, my old editor said: “Say, let’s make that strong—we’ve got to go\r\non record unmistakably for Wilson.” He worked—Goolsby worked—of course\r\nthe young one worked. I sat and ate oranges. It was all done—in less\r\nthan fifteen minutes. The Resolutions Committee reported out a glorious\r\nresolution, calling on Senators Trammell and Fletcher to support the\r\nSusan B. Anthony Amendment, and it passed unanimously. The Resolution\r\nread: “Be it resolved that we stand with President Wilson in his\r\nadvocacy of Woman Suffrage, and we urge our Representatives in Congress\r\nto vote for the enfranchisement of women!!!”\r\n\r\nThe most exciting adventure of my life was “holding up the Florida\r\nlegislature” till midnight so Governor Catts could send a resolution in\r\nasking Trammell and Fletcher (Senators) to vote for Suffrage. I saw\r\nSenator Trammell in Washington, and he said he had not decided how he\r\nwould vote on the Amendment. That his vote would represent “the\r\npeople”—I asked him if in our government a State legislature didn’t\r\nrepresent “the will of the people.” He said, “Yes, but I don’t intend to\r\ninstruct my legislature.” I said: “No, but maybe your legislature will\r\ninstruct you.” I came home and told Miss Paul, who said, “Will you go\r\ndown to Florida tonight?” and Bertha Arnold and I went. Helen Hunt, a\r\ncapable young Jacksonville lawyer, joined us, and the campaign began.\r\n\r\nIt was absolutely essential to get Governor Catts to send in the\r\nResolution, as messages from the Governor only took a majority—others a\r\ntwo-third vote, but we didn’t want this too soon. When we had our votes\r\nall there in the Senate, the leader, anti, moved that no new business\r\nnot already in by noon, could come up at all—the legislature barring\r\neverything, to save themselves from Suffrage. This was fearful, as the\r\nHouse was most difficult, and we had planned to attack the Senate first.\r\nAt four o’clock the last afternoon of the special session, called simply\r\nto discuss prohibition, we flew to the Governor’s office. Helen Hunt, a\r\nsenator, a member of the House, and I got Governor Catts to say he’d\r\nsend a message at once. 4.30 came—5.30 came—no message. In terror, I\r\nflew down. The Governor’s office was locked—I got one of the House to\r\nmove a night session—we lobbied for that, it carried. The Night Session\r\nbegan at eight—Governor Catts still nowhere to be found. Finally, after\r\nphoning his home every five minutes it seemed—I called at ten and they\r\nsaid, “Governor Catts is in bed.”—I said we had to have him. The person\r\nwho answered the phone said nothing could be done. His secretary had the\r\noffice keys; he was ill at home; his stenographer had the desk keys; she\r\nwas at a movie. These obstacles to be overcome, and Governor Catts to be\r\nrushed to the Capitol. I flew back to our night session at the Capitol.\r\nI sent in a little slip-written message to Mr. Stokes, saying: “Trust\r\nus—you said you’d help—keep this session going—filibuster—do\r\nanything—don’t let them adjourn.” I stood in the door and saw him nod\r\n“All right,” and flew.\r\n\r\nBertha Arnold in a taxi secured the outer key from the secretary—after\r\narousing secretary and encountering a storm.\r\n\r\nHelen Hunt in another taxi called for Governor Catts, waited till he got\r\nup from bed and dressed, and brought him and his daughter, Ruth, to the\r\nCapitol. I meanwhile stopped at a Western Union Office and got a\r\nmessenger boy. He said, “What am I to take?” I said, “Me!” He knew the\r\nway, and together we ran through the streets of Tallahassee at midnight,\r\ncovered every movie, and had the stenographer paged—brought her and her\r\nescort to the Capitol—produced the desk keys—got the resolution. Never\r\nwas any sound more marvelous than Governor Catts’ thud when he walked up\r\nthose Capitol steps at midnight—instantly he rushed it up—the door of\r\nthe House opened—there stood my man Stokes, talking and hoarse. He had\r\nkept them there. The secretary announced, “Message from the Governor,”\r\nand our resolution was read!\r\n\r\nThe vote was closer than close—didn’t pass, but they had to stay till\r\nthe next day at two—we stayed too, and in the morning—of the last day—we\r\ngot a majority petition from the Florida legislature which showed\r\nTrammell and Fletcher that Florida wanted their Suffrage votes.\r\n\r\nWhen I heard that Senator Trammell was arriving in Lakeland, I wired\r\nMiss Paul I would stay—Such a hectic and great day. I saw him with four\r\nantis in the hotel lobby. He looked dumbfounded, shook hands, discussed\r\nthe climate, and acted as though I were touristing because Florida was\r\nbeautiful—but he knew.\r\n\r\nThen I went out of his life—but sent others in—all day I got out little\r\ndelegations to him—the State Senator from that district—his\r\nminister—president of the Bank—leading Labor man—his editor. Mr.\r\nTrammell’s one day in Lakeland was a Woman’s Party event. I asked Mr.\r\nSmailes—a strong Labor man—boyhood friend of Trammell’s, to see him.\r\nThat night they all came to me at the hotel and each reported his\r\nachievement with Park Trammell.\r\n\r\nSmailes said: “I looked at him and said, ‘Park—it’s funny you can’t see\r\nit and those you were brought up with all can,’ and Park looked at me,\r\nand he said, ‘Well, there’s one thing worrying me a little. I don’t want\r\nwomen to get more than their share of electors.’ I just looked at him,\r\nand I said: ‘Park, you know Mrs. Smailes don’t want more than her share,\r\nbut she ain’t got her share yet; that’s what she’s asking for.’”\r\n\r\nI said, “Mr. Smailes, what do you think that Senator Trammell will do?”\r\nHe said, “I don’t know. I’ve known him since we were babies, but he’s a\r\nSenator now.”\r\n\r\nHelen Hunt met Trammell in Jacksonville when he arrived—on his “one day”\r\nto Lakeland. He said, “Where is _she_?” (meaning me). “Is she still in\r\nthe State?” (Miss Younger thinks this funny because it shows how scared\r\nthey are of the Woman’s Party—even one of us.)\r\n\r\n                                Virginia\r\n\r\nI think our hotel experiences are so funny.\r\n\r\nWe had a terrible time getting any one to consider taking action on\r\nSuffrage ratification at the Special Session. Virginia legislature\r\ncalled just for good roads—I went to Roanoke to see floor-leader Willis\r\n(strongest Suffragist in the House) and he announced he was scheduled\r\nhimself to introduce a bill saying that nothing but good roads would\r\ncome up. After a morning’s work with Willis, he decided he would bring\r\nup Suffrage provided Senator Trinkle agreed. He promised to see Trinkle\r\nthe next morning, so I decided I’d better see Trinkle that night.\r\nFortunately a train was leaving in ten minutes. I arrived at Wytheville\r\nat nine p.m. It was black. Senator Trinkle was on the platform. I picked\r\nhim out because he was the biggest man obviously and I asked where\r\nSenator Trinkle lived and he said, “I am Senator Trinkle.” When my\r\ninterview was at an end and it was fixed, he said that the last train\r\nout had left, and that I should go to the hotel, and say to the owner\r\nthat he said to give me the best room. To my great consternation, the\r\nhotel proprietor escorted me into a room the size of a young stable,\r\nwhich contained six beds, explaining, “This is our best room. I’ll call\r\nit a single room for tonight.” Never can I describe the creaks of the\r\nempty five beds all night long. It doesn’t sound funny, but it was—I and\r\nsix beds, some of them double, and a box of Uneeda crackers and\r\nHershey’s milk chocolate.\r\n\r\nThe way we got the University of Virginia mass-meeting was amusing. I\r\ntaught art at the University of Virginia Summer School. We had just\r\nstaged a big pageant at the University. Director Maphis was grateful and\r\nsaid he’d do anything I wanted. That afternoon, Senator Martin arrived\r\nin Charlottesville, his home, and so I went to see Mr. Maphis to tell\r\nhim I wanted Cabell Hall, the real University of Virginia Hall, and he\r\nsaid, “Yes.” I phoned Miss Paul and she sent Lucy Branham—we advertised\r\nwith huge sheets on the front of each of the eight street cars, in\r\nCharlottesville and hand-made slides at movies and posters that my Art\r\nclasses all were given to do as a “problem.”\r\n\r\nThe Hall was full and the wonderful old Jeffersonian University held its\r\nfirst Federal Suffrage Mass Meeting and passed resolutions urging\r\nSenator Martin to vote for the Amendment. Lucy Branham and I drove to\r\nhis home the next morning, presented him with the resolutions, and\r\ndescribed the meeting of his own constituents to him.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere perhaps is the place to describe the work of the Political\r\nDepartment, of which Abby Scott Baker was Chairman. The Political\r\nDepartment supplemented the work of the Legislative and Organization\r\nDepartments. Whenever the work of the National Woman’s Party demanded\r\ninstant pressure on Congress and on State Legislatures, Alice Paul\r\ndespatched Mrs. Baker at once to the power who could exert that\r\npressure. She was a kind of perpetual flying envoy for the Woman’s\r\nParty.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   IV\r\n\r\n           THE PRESIDENT CAPITULATES AND THE HOUSE SURRENDERS\r\n\r\n\r\nIT will be remembered that after the eight months in which the Woman’s\r\nParty picketed the President, the House of Representatives created a\r\nSuffrage Committee in September, 1917. It will also be remembered that\r\nduring the discussion on the floor, in regard to that Committee, Mr.\r\nPou, Chairman, made the statement that there was no intention of passing\r\nthe Amendment before the Sixty-sixth Congress. That Congress adjourned\r\non October 6, 1917. Also, it will be remembered that that day, Alice\r\nPaul marched over to the White House gates carrying a banner inscribed\r\nwith the words of the President:\r\n\r\n           THE TIME HAS COME WHEN WE MUST CONQUER OR SUBMIT.\r\n          FOR US THERE CAN BE BUT ONE CHOICE. WE HAVE MADE IT.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered too that Alice Paul was arrested and sentenced to\r\nseven months in jail.\r\n\r\nFollowing the publicity which came from the Woman’s Party speakers all\r\nover the country and from the newspapers, protests of all descriptions\r\nbegan to pour into the White House and to the Democratic leaders:\r\nletters, resolutions, petitions.\r\n\r\nAgain it will be remembered that a week before Congress reconvened on\r\nDecember 3, 1917, all the imprisoned women were suddenly released.\r\n\r\nIn the new Session—a direct reversal of Mr. Pou’s announcement of two\r\nmonths earlier that the House would not pass the Amendment before 1920—a\r\nday was set for the vote on the Suffrage Amendment, a week after\r\nCongress assembled.\r\n\r\nAgain, it should be pointed out that all these things happened after\r\nthose eight months of picketing.\r\n\r\nThat important day which the House set was January 10, 1918. In\r\nSeptember, the Suffragists lacked seventy-three votes of the passage of\r\nthe Amendment. Naturally all December was spent in working up that vote.\r\nThe National Woman’s Party secured statements from Republican leaders\r\nlike Mondell and Kahn, stating the strong Republican support of the\r\nmeasure and blaming the Democrats if it were defeated. The National\r\nWoman’s Party worked up the Republican majority from three-quarters of\r\nthe House to five-sixths. The Democrats began to be frightened at the\r\npress statements of the Republicans. They began to work to increase\r\ntheir showing, as they feared the country would blame them if the\r\nAmendment were defeated.\r\n\r\nBut more important than any of these things was the capitulation of the\r\nPresident which won, as the Woman’s Party contended it would, the\r\nnecessary votes in the house. On January 9, 1919, one year from the day\r\nthe Inez Milholland Memorial Deputation visited him, President Wilson\r\nmade his declaration for the Federal Amendment, and on January 10, the\r\nAmendment was passed in the House by a vote of two hundred and\r\nseventy-four to one hundred and thirty-six.\r\n\r\nThis important epoch in the history of the Suffrage Movement, Maud\r\nYounger describes in her _Revelations of a Woman Lobbyist_.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The atmosphere had changed when I returned to Washington. Republican\r\n    Congressmen had suddenly realized what an asset to the Republican\r\n    Party would be their support of Suffrage. Democrats, seeing the\r\n    blame that would attach to them for its defeat, were becoming\r\n    alarmed.\r\n\r\n    “The country is fixing to blame the Democrats,” said Mr. Hull, of\r\n    Tennessee, very thoughtfully, but not quite thoughtfully enough. As\r\n    a member of the National Executive Committee of the Democratic Party\r\n    he was thoughtful. As a Congressman with a vote in the House he was\r\n    not quite thoughtful enough.\r\n\r\n    We lacked sixty votes in the House, and had only three weeks to get\r\n    them. We worked day and night. Our friends in Congress, brightly\r\n    hopeful, told us we had votes to spare, but we knew the truth. We\r\n    lacked forty votes, then twenty, then ten, but we kept this to\r\n    ourselves. Unless something happened we could not win.\r\n\r\n    Then, on January 9, the day before the vote, it happened. Late on\r\n    that afternoon the President invited a deputation of Democratic\r\n    Congressmen to wait on him. Knowing of the appointment, we went\r\n    through the halls of Congress, on wings, all day. When the\r\n    Congressmen went into the White House, a small group stood outside\r\n    in the snow waiting for the first word of that interview. After what\r\n    seemed an interminable time, the doors opened. Out came cheery Mr.\r\n    Raker with the news: “The President has declared for the Susan B.\r\n    Anthony Amendment, and will stay home from his game of golf tomorrow\r\n    morning to see any Congressman who wishes to consult him about it.”\r\n    Thus, just a year from the day he had told us we must concert public\r\n    opinion, President Wilson declared for Suffrage.\r\n\r\n    There was a feeling of victory in the air as we went through the\r\n    corridors that night. Yet our secret poll showed that we still\r\n    lacked votes. We could do nothing more. We could only wait and see\r\n    how much force the President would put behind his declaration.\r\n\r\n    Scrub women were still at work with brushes and buckets of soapsuds\r\n    when I reached the Capitol that fateful morning. From the front row\r\n    of the gallery we looked down on the floor of the House, with its\r\n    seven rows of empty seats rising in semi-circular rows like an\r\n    amphitheatre. A few people scurried here and there, the galleries\r\n    were rapidly filling. We watched the Congressmen come in, sit down,\r\n    walk about, or stand in groups talking and looking up at the\r\n    galleries.\r\n\r\n    At the stroke of eleven all eyes turned toward the door of the\r\n    Speaker’s lobby. Chattering ceased. The door opened, and a Roman\r\n    mace appeared and advanced, supported by the Deputy\r\n    Sergeant-at-Arms, who held it in his two hands before him. Very\r\n    solemn, very mindful of his step, he ascended the three steps to the\r\n    Speaker’s stand, followed by the Speaker, Champ Clark, dignified and\r\n    magnificent in a tan frock coat, with a white flower in the\r\n    buttonhole. Having ascended, the Sergeant-at-Arms laid the mace\r\n    against the wall where all the Congressmen could look at it, and\r\n    came down again with a little skip on the last step, while the\r\n    Speaker impressively faced the House.\r\n\r\n    Prayer and routine business finished, the speeches began. Most of\r\n    them were prosy and dull, delivered not for those who heard them,\r\n    but for constituents hundreds of miles away. In the galleries we\r\n    listened wearily. We had brought luncheon with us, which we ate as\r\n    unobtrusively as possible. We would lose our seats if we left them,\r\n    for through the ground-glass doors we dimly saw waiting multitudes\r\n    trying to come in. All day the largest crowds the doorkeepers had\r\n    ever known pressed against the doors. Inside the speeches droned on.\r\n\r\n    “What a dull ending for such a dramatic struggle,” said a newspaper\r\n    man, leaning over from the press gallery. I could have wished it had\r\n    been duller, for we never for an instant forgot we still lacked\r\n    votes. We did not know how far the President’s message had carried\r\n    since our last possible poll.\r\n\r\n    Suddenly a wave of applause and cheers swept over the floor. Every\r\n    head turned toward the Speaker’s door, and there, on the threshold,\r\n    we saw Mr. Mann, pale and trembling. For six months he had lain in a\r\n    hospital—his only visitors his wife and secretary. It had been said\r\n    that he would never come back to the House. Yet he had come to vote\r\n    for our Amendment.\r\n\r\n    Now, through the skylight, we could see that the afternoon had gone,\r\n    and evening had come. At last the time for speech-making ended and\r\n    the vote was taken. Forty years to a day from the first introduction\r\n    of the Susan B. Anthony Amendment in Congress, one year exactly from\r\n    the time the first picket line went to stand before the White House,\r\n    the Federal Suffrage Amendment passed the House of Representatives.\r\n    It passed with just one vote to spare. Six votes came to us through\r\n    the President. He had saved the day!\r\n\r\n    Outside the doors of the gallery a woman began to sing, _Praise God\r\n    from whom all blessings flow_. Others took it up, more and more\r\n    voices joined, and through the halls of the Capitol there swelled\r\n    our song of gratitude. Louder and louder it rose and soared to the\r\n    high arches, and was carried out into the night to die away at last\r\n    in the far distances. And still in our hearts we sang, _Praise God\r\n    from whom all blessings flow_.\r\n\r\n    But our minds were not at rest, nor our thoughts quiet. Our victory\r\n    was worth nothing unless we could consolidate it quickly. To do this\r\n    we had to win the Senate. And the Senate is farther from the people\r\n    than the House, and much, much harder to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   V\r\n\r\n                    FIGHTING FOR VOTES IN THE SENATE\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE House of Representatives passed the Susan B. Anthony Amendment on\r\nJanuary 10, 1918, by a vote of two hundred and seventy-four to one\r\nhundred and thirty-six. The work of the Woman’s Party was now\r\nconcentrated on the Senate. They needed only eleven votes there, and\r\nmany Suffragists were optimistic—they thought victory a matter of but a\r\nfew weeks. The Woman’s Party knew better. However, in the siege of the\r\nSenate, they continued their policy—to work downwards through the\r\nPresident, and upward through constituents and political leaders from\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\nIn summing up the situation in the Senate, Alice Paul said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    If the Republicans had the vision to see that it was a wise Party\r\n    policy to secure the credit for the passage of the Amendment in the\r\n    House, and the Democrats believed it an unwise Party policy to be\r\n    responsible for its defeat—the same argument must hold for the vote\r\n    in the Senate, for while more than two-thirds of the Republicans had\r\n    already promised their votes, only half the Democrats are at present\r\n    pledged in the Senate.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe effect of the passing of the Susan B. Anthony Amendment in the House\r\nwas, however, not only profound, but immediate. In February, the\r\nRepublican National Committee met in St. Louis for the selection of a\r\nChairman. Abby Scott Baker appeared before the committee, urging a\r\nfavorable stand on the Susan B. Anthony amendment. Two women\r\nrepresenting the anti-Suffragists were also to speak. However, when the\r\nanti-Suffragist speakers presented themselves before the Committee, they\r\nfound that it had already voted a resolution commending the stand of the\r\nRepublican members of the House of Representatives in favor of the\r\nSuffrage Amendment. This was the first favorable expression of the\r\nNational Republican Party on the question of Federal Suffrage.\r\n\r\nMinnie Bronson said of the anti-Suffragist members:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I looked round for the thirty members who last night were opposed to\r\n    Suffrage. I wonder what changed them over night.\r\n\r\n\r\nLucy Price, also an anti-Suffragist, asserted:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Your action without even hearing us was worse than a betrayal of us\r\n    who are opposed to Suffrage. It was an admission that Party pledges\r\n    are meant to be broken.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Executive Committee of the Democratic National Committee, which met\r\nthat same day in Washington, held a telegraphic referendum of their\r\nentire national committee on the question of the Amendment. It is\r\ninteresting to note that this was done at the insistence of the\r\nDemocratic woman who had charge of the Democratic campaign among women\r\nin 1916, when the Woman’s Party made Suffrage the great issue. This\r\ntelegraphic referendum showed more than a two to one desire for the\r\nnational committee to take action that would put it on record as “urging\r\nthe support” of the Amendment. The Executive Committee, therefore,\r\nadopted the resolution, endorsing the Federal Suffrage measure, and by a\r\nvote of five to two, calling upon the Senate to act at once favorably\r\nupon it.\r\n\r\nFor months thereafter, the Woman’s Party concentrated on obtaining the\r\nnecessary eleven votes in the Senate. It was a period of comparative\r\ncalm. There was no militant action of any kind. The pickets had all been\r\nreleased in December, and, although the appeal cases were coming up in\r\nthe courts at intervals, picketing seemed an abandoned weapon.\r\n\r\nIn her _Revelations of a Woman Lobbyist_, Maud Younger describes very\r\ndelightfully how the first nine votes were obtained:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “We should get Senator Phelan now,” said Miss Paul. “He opposed\r\n    Federal Suffrage because the President did. Now that the President\r\n    has come out for it, Senator Phelan should do so. Send for him.”\r\n\r\n    I sent in my card and he came at once, very neat in a cut-away coat,\r\n    his eyes smiling above his trimmed sandy beard. “Of course I’ll vote\r\n    for the Amendment,” he said, as though he had never thought of\r\n    anything else. He was plainly glad to have an excuse for changing\r\n    his position.\r\n\r\n    “That leaves ten to get,” said Miss Paul. “Let’s go and see Senator\r\n    McCumber.” The Senator from North Dakota is sandy and Scotch and\r\n    cautious, and, like many other Senators, thinks it would be weak and\r\n    vacillating to change his opinion.\r\n\r\n    “I voted against it in 1914. I cannot vote for it in 1918,” he said.\r\n    “I cannot change my principles.”\r\n\r\n    “But you can change your mind?”\r\n\r\n    “No, I could not do that.”\r\n\r\n    “Then you might change your vote,” said I, urging progress. He, too,\r\n    saw progress, but was wary of it. Looking cautiously around the room\r\n    and back of us, he said slowly, “If the legislature of my State\r\n    should ask me to vote for it, I would feel obliged to do so.”\r\n\r\n    That same night Beulah Amidon telegraphed to North Dakota,—her own\r\n    State—to the Chairman of the Republican Party and the Non-Partisan\r\n    League that controls the Legislature; to her father, Judge Amidon,\r\n    and to others. The Legislature immediately passed a resolution\r\n    calling on Senator McCumber to vote for our Amendment. Miss Amidon\r\n    went to see him at once, with the news.\r\n\r\n    “But I haven’t seen how the resolution is worded yet,” said Senator\r\n    McCumber cannily.\r\n\r\n    When the resolution arrived some one else went to see him.\r\n\r\n    “I want to look it over carefully,” he said. When he had looked it\r\n    over carefully, he admitted, “I will vote for the Amendment. But to\r\n    show loyalty both to constituents and principle,” he added hastily,\r\n    “I will speak against it, and vote for it.”\r\n\r\n    “That leaves nine to get,” said Miss Paul, counting Senator McCumber\r\n    off on her little finger and turning to a list of other legislatures\r\n    in session. The difficulty was that the legislatures in session did\r\n    not fit the Senators whose votes we must get. Mildred Glines, our\r\n    Rhode Island chairman, was at our Headquarters, and Senator Gerry of\r\n    Rhode Island was at the Capitol, and not for our Amendment. So\r\n    Mildred Glines set out at once for Rhode Island, where she had a\r\n    resolution presented and passed, and returned with it to Senator\r\n    Gerry.\r\n\r\n    Then I went to see his colleague, Senator Colt. A scholarly-looking\r\n    man, he sat at his desk deep in some volume of ancient lore. Arguing\r\n    with himself while I sat listening, he stated the case for Suffrage\r\n    and Senator Gerry. “But on the other hand,” he said—and then stated\r\n    the other side.\r\n\r\n    “Yes,” he concluded deliberately, but with a twinkle in his eye,\r\n    “Peter will vote for it.”\r\n\r\n    “That leaves eight to get,” said Miss Paul, very thoughtfully. “Have\r\n    you seen Senator King lately?”\r\n\r\n    Though Senator King is not unpleasant to talk with, if one does not\r\n    broach subjects controversial, persons who appealed to his reason\r\n    had succeeded only in ruffling his manners. He smiled blandly and,\r\n    leaning back in his chair, began what he believed to be a perfect\r\n    case. “I’ve always been opposed to national Suffrage. I said so in\r\n    my campaign, and the people elected me.”\r\n\r\n    We must appeal to his constituents. But how? His Legislature was not\r\n    in session. Alice Henkle went post-haste to Utah, and at once\r\n    newspapers began to publish editorials; all sorts of organizations,\r\n    civic, patriotic, religious, educational, social, began to pass\r\n    resolutions. Letters poured in upon Senator King. But always Miss\r\n    Henkle wrote us, “They tell me everywhere that it’s no use; that\r\n    Senator King is so ‘hard-shelled’ that I might as well stop.”\r\n\r\n    “Go to the Capitol and see,” said Miss Alice Paul.\r\n\r\n    I had just entered the revolving door when Senator Sheppard,\r\n    hurrying past, stopped to say, “Do you know King is coming around! I\r\n    think we may get his vote.”\r\n\r\n    So Miss Paul wired Alice Henkle that night: “Redouble efforts. They\r\n    are having good effect.” Four weeks later, three Senators told me\r\n    that Senator King had said in the cloak room, “I’m as much opposed\r\n    to Federal Suffrage as ever, but I think I’ll vote for it. My\r\n    constituents want me to.”\r\n\r\n    “That leaves six to get,” said Miss Paul, “counting Senator\r\n    Culberson too.” For while we had been busy in Washington, Doris\r\n    Stevens and Clara Wolfe had been busy in Texas on the trail of\r\n    Senator Culberson.\r\n\r\n    The national committees of both political parties had taken a stand\r\n    for Federal Suffrage in February. Also, Colonel Roosevelt and other\r\n    Republican leaders were writing to Senators whose names we\r\n    furnished, urging their support.\r\n\r\n    “Now,” said Senator Curtis, smiling, “I think we’ll get Harding and\r\n    Sutherland. They both want to vote for it, but their States are\r\n    against it. I’ll go see them again. Keep the backfires burning in\r\n    their States.”\r\n\r\n    Senator Curtis has the dark hair and skin of Indian ancestry, and\r\n    perhaps his Indian blood has given him his quick sense of a\r\n    situation and his knowledge of men. Without quite knowing how it\r\n    happened—it may have been his interest in listening or his wisdom in\r\n    advising—he had become the guiding friend, the storm-center of our\r\n    work on the Republican side of the Senate.\r\n\r\n    “Colonel Roosevelt has written to Senator Sutherland too,” I thought\r\n    hopefully, while I sat waiting for him in the marble room. He came\r\n    out, and said almost at once, “I’ve just had a letter from Colonel\r\n    Roosevelt asking me to vote for your Amendment!”\r\n\r\n    “Have you?” said I.\r\n\r\n    “Yes. But I wish he had told me how I can do it, when the\r\n    overwhelming sentiment of my State is against it.” I spoke of\r\n    something else, but that night I reported this remark to Doris\r\n    Stevens and Abby Scott Baker. Both of them immediately wrote to\r\n    Colonel Roosevelt. Later, I again saw Senator Sutherland. He had\r\n    evidently forgotten our former conversation.\r\n\r\n    “I’ve had a letter from Colonel Roosevelt about your Amendment,” he\r\n    said. “It’s the second time he has written to me about it. He wants\r\n    me to come to Oyster Bay so he can give me reasons for voting for\r\n    it.”\r\n\r\n    “I should think it would be awfully interesting to go,” I encouraged\r\n    gently. And soon we checked off Senator Sutherland’s name on our\r\n    lists, and said, “Five more to get.”\r\n\r\n    “Do you think we can get Borah?” I asked Senator Curtis. “He’s one\r\n    of the fathers of the Amendment. He introduced it in 1910.”\r\n\r\n    “He says he did that by request.”\r\n\r\n    “It doesn’t say so in the Record. Doesn’t a man always say so when\r\n    it is so?”\r\n\r\n    “That is usual,” said Senator Curtis, stroking his mustache and not\r\n    meeting my eyes, and I knew he said only half of what he thought.\r\n\r\n    “I think I’ll go and see him at once.”\r\n\r\n    Senator Borah is a most approachable person, but when you have\r\n    approached, you cannot be sure you have reached. You see him sitting\r\n    at his desk, a large unferocious, bulldog type of man, simple in\r\n    manner. You talk with him, and you think he is with you through and\r\n    through.... But you never quite know.... Sometimes you wonder if\r\n    _he_ knows.\r\n\r\n\r\n    In April, Senator Gallinger told Miss Paul that the Republicans\r\n    counted four more votes for Suffrage—Kellogg, Harding, Page, and\r\n    Borah. “We understand Borah will vote for the Amendment if it will\r\n    not pass otherwise. But he will not vote for it if it will pass\r\n    without him. But if his vote will carry it, he will vote for it.”\r\n\r\n    Thus far we had come on our journey toward the eleven, when Senator\r\n    Andreus Aristides Jones of New Mexico, Chairman of the Woman\r\n    Suffrage Committee, rose in the Senate and announced that on May 10\r\n    he would move to take up the Suffrage resolution. There was great\r\n    rejoicing. We thought that now the Administration would get the\r\n    needed votes.\r\n\r\n\r\nIndeed, with only two votes more to get, everything looked promising.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn May, members of the Woman’s Committee of the Council of National\r\nDefense were received by the President and Mrs. Wilson.\r\n\r\nFlorence Bayard Hilles, State Chairman in Delaware for the National\r\nWoman’s Party, who had campaigned for the Liberty Loan throughout her\r\nState, and was then working in the Bethlehem Steel Plant, as a munition\r\nmaker, said to the President:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Mr. President, it would be a great inspiration to all of us in our\r\n    war work if you would help towards our immediate enfranchisement.\r\n\r\n\r\nBehind Mrs. Hilles came Mrs. Arthur Kellam, who is Chairman of the\r\nWoman’s Party in New Mexico, who said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Mr. President, we, women of the West, are growing very restless\r\n    indeed waiting for the long-delayed passage of the Federal Suffrage\r\n    Amendment. Won’t you help to secure this recognition of citizens?\r\n    The women of New Mexico and many other States have no redress save\r\n    through the Federal Amendment. They are eagerly waiting for action\r\n    on this measure in the Senate. Will you help us?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe President, with marked cordiality, answered:\r\n\r\n“I will. I will do all I can.”\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the President was receiving picturesque groups of many\r\ndescriptions: Pershing’s Veterans went to the White House; the Blue\r\nDevils of France. Finally a group of women munition workers from the\r\nBethlehem Plant, led by Florence Bayard Hilles, came to Washington to\r\nsee the President in regard to Suffrage. They were: Catherine Boyle; Ada\r\nWalling; Mary Gonzon; Lula Patterson; Marie McKenzie; Isabel C. Aniba;\r\nLilian Jerrold; Mary Campbell; Mildred Peck; Ida Lennox. The experience\r\nof the war workers was amusing. They wrote at once asking for an\r\ninterview with the President. Mr. Tumulty responded saying that the\r\nPresident bade him to tell them that “nothing you or your associates\r\ncould say could possibly increase his very deep interest in this\r\nmatter.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Aniba despatched an answer, again asking for an interview. She said\r\namong other things:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The work I do is making detonators, handling TNT, the highest of all\r\n    explosives. We want to be recognized by our country as much her\r\n    citizens as soldiers are.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery day this little group went to the White House and sat, waiting.\r\nThey made a picturesque detail in the exceedingly picturesque war flood\r\nsurging through the White House, wearing bands printed with the words,\r\n_munition workers_ on their arm and their identification badges. They\r\nknitted all the time. At first, one of the secretaries explained to\r\nthem, “You are very foolish. You may have to wait for weeks. Even Lord\r\nReading had to come back four times before he saw the President!”\r\n\r\nLater, an under-secretary said: “You are becoming a nuisance. Other\r\npeople have more consideration than to keep coming back; but you persist\r\nand persist.”\r\n\r\n“Even Lord Reading had to come back four times before he saw the\r\nPresident,” quoted one of the munition girls.\r\n\r\nThey waited two weeks, but in the end they had to go back to work. They\r\nwrote a letter to the Senate, however, which was read there.\r\n\r\nMay 10 approached. I resume Miss Younger’s narrative:\r\n\r\n\r\n    When the proper time arrived next day, Senator Andreus Aristides\r\n    Jones arose in his place. The galleries were packed. Our forces were\r\n    all present except the three missing votes. There was Senator Smith\r\n    of Michigan, who had come from California; Senator Smith of Arizona,\r\n    who had left a sick relative to be present for the vote; and there\r\n    were others who had come from far and wide. Senator Jones in the\r\n    hush of a great moment, rose and announced that he would not call up\r\n    the Amendment that day.\r\n\r\n    Our opponents looked at him and, grinning, taunted: “Haven’t you got\r\n    the votes?” “We want to vote today.” “We’re ready now.”\r\n\r\n    Finally the women filed out of the galleries and went home, and the\r\n    Senate resumed its usual business.\r\n\r\n\r\nLater, however, Senator Jones announced that on June 27 he would take up\r\nthe Suffrage Resolution.\r\n\r\nMiss Younger says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Senator Jones does not act on mad impulse. No one could imagine that\r\n    placid, unhurried man buckling on his armor and brandishing his\r\n    sword to lead his forces a second time up a blind alley only to lead\r\n    them back again. Senator Jones was a strong Administration man and\r\n    would not act without approval.\r\n\r\n    Moreover, he was a sincere Suffragist. In fact, he was a Father of\r\n    the Amendment. So we kept at work, aiding and abetting all its\r\n    Fathers. For the disabilities of fathers are manifest when you\r\n    compare them with mothers. A father is so casual, especially when\r\n    his child is an Amendment to the Constitution.\r\n\r\n    “Nagging!” said Senator Lenroot viciously, when I asked him to speak\r\n    to Senator Borah. “If you women would only stop nagging!” And making\r\n    a savage face at me, he hurried down the hall.\r\n\r\n    I stood still. It was but the second time we had spoken to him since\r\n    he had come to the Senate. I wondered if he thought we liked\r\n    “nagging”; if we liked going to the Capitol day after day, tramping\r\n    on marble floors, waiting in ante-rooms—sometimes rebuffed,\r\n    sometimes snarled at. I wondered if he thought we could do it for\r\n    anything but a great cause—for the thousands of women toiling in the\r\n    factories, for the thousands struggling under burdens at home. And\r\n    then I bit my lips to keep back the tears, and putting aside such\r\n    uncomfortable things as feelings, and putting forward such solacing\r\n    things as a lace jabot and a smile, I sent for another Senator.\r\n\r\n    Senator Martin, of silvery white hair and determined manner would\r\n    not sit down and talk Suffrage, nor would he stand up and talk\r\n    Suffrage. The only way to discuss Suffrage with Senator Martin was\r\n    to run beside him down the hall.\r\n\r\n    “The good women of Virginia do not want Suffrage,” he said, breaking\r\n    almost into a trot, with eyes on his goal, which was an elevator.\r\n\r\n    “But if you were convinced that the good women of Virginia do want\r\n    it?” you replied, breaking almost into a run, with your eyes on him.\r\n\r\n    “It’s only the professional agitators I hear from,” he answered.\r\n\r\n    It is interesting to talk Suffrage with Senator Martin, and very\r\n    good exercise. But it was still more interesting to watch a\r\n    deputation of good Virginia women talking to him.\r\n\r\n    “Every one knows where I stand, and yet the ladies waylay me all\r\n    about the halls,” he complained. Yet when we had spoken before the\r\n    Platform Committee of the Democratic Convention in St. Louis, he\r\n    told me: “I said to those men, ‘There isn’t an equal number of you\r\n    that could make as good speeches as those women made.’” So he was\r\n    not to be considered as hopeless, though the path to his salvation\r\n    was a strenuous one.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn June, Carrie Chapman Catt, President of the International Woman\r\nSuffrage Alliance, transmitted to the President a memorial from the\r\nFrench Union for Woman Suffrage asking him in one of his messages to\r\nproclaim the principle of Woman Suffrage to be one of the fundamental\r\nrights of the future.\r\n\r\nThe President replied in the following letter:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I have read your message with the deepest interest, and I welcome\r\n    the opportunity to say that I agree, without reservation, that the\r\n    full and sincere democratic reconstruction of the world, for which\r\n    we are striving, and which we are determined to bring about at any\r\n    cost, will not have been completely or adequately attained until\r\n    women are admitted to the Suffrage. And that only by this action can\r\n    the nations of the world realize for the benefit of future\r\n    generations the full ideal force of opinion, or the full humane\r\n    forces of action.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The services of women during this supreme crisis of the world’s\r\n    history have been of the most signal usefulness and distinction. The\r\n    war could not have been fought without them or its sacrifices\r\n    endured. It is high time that some part of our debt of gratitude to\r\n    them should be acknowledged and paid, and the only acknowledgment\r\n    they ask is their admission to the Suffrage. Can we justly refuse\r\n    it?\r\n\r\n    As for America, it is my earnest hope that the Senate of the United\r\n    States will give unmistakable answer to this question by passing the\r\n    Suffrage Amendment to our Federal Constitution before the end of\r\n    this session.\r\n\r\n              Cordially and sincerely yours,\r\n\r\n                  WOODROW WILSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nMiss Younger says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The twenty-seventh of June approached. Again we were in the marble\r\n    room talking with Senators. Absentees were on trains hurrying to\r\n    Washington. The antis were in the reception room knitting votes into\r\n    their wool. The Capitol thrilled with excitement. Even the Senators\r\n    seemed to feel it. This time Sutherland would vote “yea,” and\r\n    several opponents were absent. If none of them paired with a\r\n    Suffrage Senator we could just manage the necessary majority. And\r\n    the White House was taking a hand. Senator James of Kentucky, in a\r\n    Baltimore hospital, had promised Mr. Tumulty that he would not\r\n    pair—that is, that he would not ask a Suffrage Senator to refrain\r\n    from voting to counterbalance his own enforced absence. Victory\r\n    seemed in our hands.\r\n\r\n    The day arrived. The galleries were filled. The Senators came in all\r\n    dressed up for the occasion—here a gay waistcoat or a bright tie,\r\n    there a flower in a buttonhole, yonder an elegant frock coat over\r\n    gray trousers.\r\n\r\n    Senator Jones arose to take up the Amendment. At once opposition\r\n    developed. Our opponents were willing to have a vote, provided all\r\n    absentees could be paired. Now, if all absentees were counted, we\r\n    would not have enough votes. Senator James’ promise not to vote had\r\n    given us our majority. But, stunned, we heard Senator Underwood read\r\n    a telegram from Senator James pleading that some Suffragist pair\r\n    with him. Senator Underwood said he had just confirmed the telegram.\r\n    It was not until too late that we learned the truth. The telegram\r\n    had been sent six weeks earlier for another occasion.\r\n\r\n    And now Senator Reed had the floor. “Oh, who will pair with Ollie\r\n    James?” he cried. “That n-o-oble Ollie James! You all know that\r\n    great, fine, noble specimen of manhood, Ollie James! A pair! A\r\n    pair!” he cried with tears in his voice and arms outstretched. He\r\n    went on and on.\r\n\r\n    We leaned over the balcony and watched Senator Curtis pleading with\r\n    Borah, urging him to vote for us and save our Amendment. We watched\r\n    breathlessly. We saw Borah listen, smile, and then, without a word,\r\n    rise and walk slowly out of the room. We flew down to Senator\r\n    Curtis.\r\n\r\n    “No, Borah won’t do it. They say King is going to. Reed won’t give\r\n    up the floor unless we withdraw or furnish a pair. He and his\r\n    friends will hold the floor for weeks, if necessary. And the\r\n    military bill must pass before July first. The army needs money. You\r\n    can see for yourself what’s happening. It’s a filibuster.”\r\n\r\n    Reed was still talking. They say he knows about a great many\r\n    subjects, and I think he talked about all he knew that day. But\r\n    nobody will ever know what they were, for no one listened; and he\r\n    never allowed the speech to be printed in the Record.\r\n\r\n    Finally Senator Jones arose and withdrew the motion to take up\r\n    Suffrage. Senator Reed, satisfied, sat down. His filibuster had\r\n    succeeded. He had threatened to hold up the military bill to defeat\r\n    us, so we had withdrawn. The Senate took up the military bill, and\r\n    we went home.\r\n\r\n    “Suffrage is dead for this session,” said Senator McKellar. “The\r\n    Senators don’t like being nagged any more. They are all very tired\r\n    of it.”\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the Woman’s Party did not think it was dead. They worked at their\r\nusual strenuous pace all summer long. They did feel, however, that if\r\nthe President had exerted himself, he could have obtained the two\r\nnecessary votes for the Amendment to pass. They were, moreover, highly\r\nindignant over the filibuster of a Democratic Senator—Reed. Their\r\npatience was beginning to wear thin.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the primary Senatorial elections were coming up, and\r\nthe President was taking an active part in them. He was working against\r\nSenator Vardaman of Mississippi and Senator Hardwick of Georgia, both\r\nDemocrats of course and Vardaman a Suffragist. In other States, he\r\nhelped to elect anti-Suffragists in the places of Suffragists. It is\r\ntrue that the President threw a sop to the Suffragists in that he asked\r\nSenator Shields of Tennessee to come out for Suffrage. The Shields\r\nincident is interesting.\r\n\r\nSenator Shields was making it his sole issue in the primary campaign\r\nthat he would carry out all the President’s war policies. Opposing\r\nSenator Shields was Governor Rye, a Democrat of course, and a\r\nSuffragist.\r\n\r\nMaud Younger called at the White House on Secretary Tumulty one day to\r\nask him if the President could not do something further for Suffrage.\r\nMr. Tumulty’s answer was to read a letter from President Wilson to\r\nSenator Shields, asking him to vote for the Suffrage Amendment. Maud\r\nYounger, with characteristic political astuteness, saw at once the\r\npossibilities in the publication of that letter. She asked Mr. Tumulty\r\nfor a copy and Mr. Tumulty, with a sudden sense of indiscretion,\r\nrefused. However, Miss Younger went back instantly with the story to\r\nHeadquarters, and presently Sue White and Lucy Branham became very\r\nbusy—oh, very busy indeed—in the Tennessee campaign.\r\n\r\nOn July 26, Senator Shields notified the Suffragists in Tennessee that\r\nhe would see them at three that afternoon. He told the fifty women who\r\ngathered to meet him that “he would hold the matter in consideration.”\r\nThe same day a Columbia paper carried the story that President Wilson\r\nhad requested Senator Shields by letter to vote for Suffrage. This\r\nbrought the whole month-old correspondence before the public.\r\n\r\nThe letters ran as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n              THE WHITE HOUSE, WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n                        June 20, 1918.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR SENATOR:\r\n\r\n    I feel so deeply the possibilities latent in the vote which is\r\n    presently to be taken by the Senate on the Suffrage Amendment that I\r\n    am going to take a liberty which in ordinary circumstances I should\r\n    not feel justified in taking, and ask you very frankly if it will\r\n    not be possible for you to vote for the Amendment. I feel that much\r\n    of the morale of this country and of the world will repose in our\r\n    sincere adherence to democratic principles, will depend upon the\r\n    action which the Senate takes in this now critically important\r\n    matter. If it were merely a domestic question, or if the times were\r\n    normal, I would not feel that I could make a direct request of this\r\n    sort, but the times are so far from normal, the fortunes of nations\r\n    are so linked together, the reactions upon the thought of the world\r\n    are so sharp and involve such momentous issues that I know that you\r\n    will indulge my unusual course of action and permit me to beg very\r\n    earnestly that you will lend your aid in clearing away the\r\n    difficulties which will undoubtedly beset us if the Amendment is not\r\n    adopted. With much respect,\r\n\r\n                   Sincerely yours,\r\n\r\n                        WOODROW WILSON.\r\n\r\n              UNITED STATES SENATE, WASHINGTON, D. C.\r\n\r\n                   June 25, 1918.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR MR. PRESIDENT:\r\n\r\n    Your valued letter concerning the joint resolution proposing an\r\n    Amendment on the Federal Constitution favoring Equal Suffrage, now\r\n    pending in the United States Senate, has challenged my most\r\n    thoughtful consideration, as do all your views upon public matters.\r\n    The resolution involves fundamental questions affecting the\r\n    sovereignty and powers of the Federal and State governments, most\r\n    important and vital to the people of the State which I have the\r\n    honor in part to represent in the United States Senate, and those of\r\n    States with which they are closely allied in all social, economical,\r\n    and governmental interests, upon which I have most profound\r\n    convictions, unfavorable to it, known, and I believe approved, by\r\n    the great majority of the people of Tennessee—arrived at after full\r\n    consideration of conditions existing when I voted against a similar\r\n    one some years ago and those now confronting our country. The\r\n    reasons for my conclusions are those controlling the majority of my\r\n    colleagues from the Southern States, well known to you and which\r\n    would not be interesting to here re-state.\r\n\r\n    If I could bring myself to believe that the adoption of the\r\n    Resolution would contribute to the successful prosecution of the war\r\n    we are waging with Germany, I would unhesitatingly vote for it,\r\n    because my whole heart and soul is involved in bringing it to a\r\n    victorious issue and I am willing to sacrifice everything save the\r\n    honor and freedom of our country in aiding you to accomplish that\r\n    end. But I have been unable to do so. We cannot reasonably expect\r\n    the proposed Amendment to be ratified within less than two years and\r\n    the discussion of it would, unquestionably, divert the minds and\r\n    energies of the people from the one great absorbing subject before\r\n    us—the winning of the war—by involving those of many States in a\r\n    most bitter controversy contrary to our earnest desire for that\r\n    unity of thought and action of the American people now so\r\n    imperatively required.\r\n\r\n    These are my sincere convictions, but, out of my very high respect\r\n    for your views, I will continue to give your suggestion my most\r\n    thoughtful and earnest consideration.\r\n\r\n    With the highest respect, I am,\r\n\r\n              Sincerely yours,\r\n\r\n                   JOHN K. SHIELDS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        WASHINGTON, D. C.\r\n\r\n                          June 26, 1918.\r\n\r\n    Thank you very sincerely for your frank letter of yesterday about\r\n    the Suffrage Amendment. I realize the weight of argument that has\r\n    controlled your attitude in the matter, and I would not have written\r\n    as I did if I had not thought that the passage of the Amendment at\r\n    this time was an essential psychological element in the conduct of\r\n    the war for democracy. I am led by a single sentence in your letter,\r\n    therefore, to write to say that I do earnestly believe that our\r\n    acting upon this Amendment will have an important and immediate\r\n    influence upon the whole atmosphere and morale of the nations\r\n    engaged in the war, and every day I am coming to see how supremely\r\n    important that side of the whole thing is. We can win if we have the\r\n    will to win.\r\n\r\n              Cordially and sincerely yours,\r\n\r\n                   WOODROW WILSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany believe that had President Wilson—in regard to Suffrage—gone over\r\nShields’ head to his constituents as—in regard to other war policies—he\r\nhad gone over the heads of Vardaman and Hardwick to their constituents,\r\nSenator Shields would have declared in favor of Suffrage.\r\n\r\nOn August 2, a letter written by the President to Senator Baird of New\r\nJersey was made public:\r\n\r\nThe President writes:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The whole subject of Woman Suffrage has been very much in my mind of\r\n    late and has come to seem to be a part of the international\r\n    situation, as well as of capital importance to the United States. I\r\n    believe our present position as champions of democracy throughout\r\n    the world would be greatly strengthened if the Senate would follow\r\n    the example of the House of Representatives in passing the pending\r\n    Amendment. I, therefore, take the liberty of writing to call the\r\n    matter to your serious attention in this light and to express the\r\n    hope that you will deem it wise to throw your influence on the side\r\n    of this great and now critical reform.\r\n\r\n              (Signed) WOODROW WILSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn spite of these letters, which of course were mere requests, Alice\r\nPaul well knew, as did the Senators themselves, that President Wilson\r\nwas doing a little for Suffrage, but not all he could. He was not of\r\ncourse doing for the Suffrage Amendment a tithe of what he did for other\r\nmeasures in whose success he was interested. Nothing continued to happen\r\nwith monotonous, unfailing regularity.\r\n\r\nThe Woman’s Party could wait no longer.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   VI\r\n\r\n                     BURNING THE PRESIDENT’S WORDS\r\n\r\n\r\nAT half-past four on Tuesday afternoon, August 6, a line of nearly one\r\nhundred women emerged from Headquarters, crossed the other side of the\r\nstreet to the Park; turned into Pennsylvania Avenue. At the head of the\r\nlong line floated the red, white, and blue of the American flag carried\r\nby Hazel Hunkins. Behind it came, banner after banner and banner after\r\nbanner, the purple, white, and gold of the National Woman’s Party\r\ntri-color. The line proceeded along Pennsylvania Avenue until it came to\r\nthe statue of Lafayette just opposite the east gate of the White House.\r\nAll along the way, the crowds cheered and applauded the women; soldiers\r\nand sailors saluted the red, white, and blue as it passed.\r\n\r\nAt the Lafayette monument, two banner bearers emerged from the group;\r\nand stationed themselves on the platform at the base of the statue.\r\n\r\nOne of them, Mary Gertrude Fendall, bore Inez Milholland’s banner,\r\ninscribed with her memorable last words:\r\n\r\n                 HOW LONG MUST WOMEN WAIT FOR LIBERTY?\r\n\r\nThe other, borne by Clara Wold and Blanche McPherson, carried what was\r\nreally the message of the meeting:\r\n\r\n           WE PROTEST AGAINST THE CONTINUED DISFRANCHISEMENT\r\n           OF AMERICAN WOMEN, FOR WHICH THE PRESIDENT OF THE\r\n                     UNITED STATES IS RESPONSIBLE.\r\n\r\n          WE CONDEMN THE PRESIDENT AND HIS PARTY FOR ALLOWING\r\n               THE OBSTRUCTION OF SUFFRAGE IN THE SENATE.\r\n\r\nWE DEPLORE THE WEAKNESS OF PRESIDENT WILSON IN PERMITTING THE SENATE TO\r\nLINE ITSELF WITH THE PRUSSIAN REICHSTAG BY DENYING DEMOCRACY TO THE\r\nPEOPLE WE DEMAND THAT THE PRESIDENT AND HIS PARTY SECURE THE PASSAGE OF\r\nTHE SUFFRAGE AMENDMENT THROUGH THE SENATE IN THE PRESENT SESSION. The\r\nother banner bearers marched to both sides of the statue where they made\r\nsolid banks of vivid color. Mrs. Lawrence Lewis stepped forward. “We are\r\nhere,” she said, “because when our country is at war for liberty and\r\ndemocracy....”\r\n\r\nAt the word “democracy,” the police, who had been drawing nearer and\r\nnearer, placed her under arrest. Other women standing about her were\r\narrested, although they had not even spoken.\r\n\r\nFor a moment there was a complete silence.\r\n\r\nThen Hazel Hunkins, who had led the line carrying the American flag,\r\nleaped upon the base of the statue and said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Here, at the statue of Lafayette, who fought for the liberty of this\r\n    country, and under the American flag, I am asking for the\r\n    enfranchisement of American women.\r\n\r\n\r\nShe was immediately arrested. Another woman took her place, and she was\r\narrested; another; and another; and on and on, until forty-seven women\r\nhad been taken into custody.\r\n\r\nAlice Paul, who had not participated in the parade, was standing in the\r\nmiddle of the street, watching and listening. She had no banner. She had\r\nnot spoken. She had not moved. But a policeman, pointing at her, said:\r\n“That is the leader; get her!” And she was arrested.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BURNING THE PRESIDENT’S WORDS AT THE LAFAYETTE MONUMENT,\r\nWASHINGTON.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A SUMMER PICKET LINE.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMany women asked on what charge they were arrested. “Do not answer them!\r\nDo not tell them anything!” said a policeman. Others answered with very\r\nlabored charges, which were not substantiated later by Police\r\nHeadquarters. Patrol wagon after patrol wagon appeared, was filled with\r\nwomen, and dashed off, followed by the purple, white, and gold flutter\r\nof the banners.\r\n\r\nWhen Hazel Hunkins was arrested, she forbade the policemen to take the\r\nAmerican flag which she carried from her. At the Municipal Building, she\r\nrefused to relinquish it. After the preliminaries of their arrest were\r\nover and the women released on bail, they marched back in an unbroken\r\nline behind Hazel’s flag.\r\n\r\nThe arrested women were the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Hazel Adams, Eva E. Sturtevant, Pauline Clarke, Blanche A.\r\n    McPherson, Katherine R. Fisher, Rose Lieberson, Alice Kimball,\r\n    Matilda Terrace, Lucy Burns, Edith Ainge, May Sullivan, Mary\r\n    Gertrude Fendall, Julia Emory, Anna Kuhn, Gladys Greiner, Martha W.\r\n    Moore, Cora Crawford, Dr. Sarah Hunt Lockrey, Mrs. Lawrence Lewis,\r\n    Ellen Winsor, Mary Winsor, Mrs. Edmund C. Evans, Christine M. Doyle,\r\n    Kate Cleaver Heffelfinger, Lavinia Dock, Harriet Keehn, Alice Paul,\r\n    Mary E. Dubrow, Lillian M. Ascough, Edna M. Purtelle, Ruby E.\r\n    Koeing, Elsie Hill, Helena Hill Weed, Eleanor Hill Weed, Mrs. Gilson\r\n    Gardner, Sophie G. Meredith, Louise M. Black, Agnes Chase, Kate J.\r\n    Boeckh, Hazel Hunkins, Cora Wold, Clara P. Wold, Margaret Oakes,\r\n    Mollie Marie Green, Gertrude Lynde Crocker, Effie Boutwell Main,\r\n    Annie Arniel, Emily Burke Main.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe forty-seven were ordered to appear in court the next morning at\r\nhalf-past nine. The United States attorney told them, when he arrived at\r\n10:30, that the case was postponed for a week. The police clerk told\r\nClara Wold that she was arrested “for climbing the statue.”\r\n\r\nClara Wold describes her subsequent experiences when, dismissed by the\r\ncourt, she walked to Headquarters past the Lafayette monument, “there\r\nsat a colored man on the very same ledge—basket, bundles, and papers\r\nstrewn about him as he comfortably devoured a sandwich.”\r\n\r\nLafayette Park was not under the District of Columbia, but directly\r\nunder the President’s military aide—Colonel Ridley, who was also\r\nSuperintendent of Public Buildings and grounds in Washington.\r\n\r\nOn August 13, the women appeared in the Federal Police Court, as\r\nordered, for trial. The charge had been decided on; “For holding a\r\nmeeting in public grounds.” But again the Court announced postponement\r\nuntil August 15.\r\n\r\nAfter vigorous protests by the Suffragists against further delay, the\r\ncases of the eighteen, who were charged in addition with “climbing a\r\nstatue,” were tried separately.\r\n\r\nThe women had no lawyers. Each spoke on her own behalf. They defended\r\nthemselves on the ground of the constitutional right of free assemblage\r\nand appeal to the Government for the redress of grievances. They all\r\npleaded, Not Guilty. Many of them added that they did not recognize the\r\njurisdiction of the Court. Hazel Hunkins explained: “Women cannot be\r\nlaw-breakers until they are law-makers.”\r\n\r\nOne of the witnesses was the Chief Clerk of Public Grounds, an elderly\r\nman. Elsie Hill suddenly asked him when he had taken office. He replied,\r\n“In 1878.” “Do you realize,” Miss Hill said, “that in that year a\r\nFederal Suffrage Amendment was introduced, and that since then women\r\nhave been helping to pay your salary and that of other government\r\nofficials under protest?” The Chief Clerk was so astounded that he\r\nmerely shook his head.\r\n\r\nThe trial of the remainder of the women on the charge of “holding a\r\nmeeting on public grounds” took place on August 15.\r\n\r\nAt the very beginning of proceedings Alice Paul said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    As a disfranchised class we feel that we are not subject to the\r\n    jurisdiction of this court and therefore refuse to take any part in\r\n    its proceedings. We also feel that we have done nothing to justify\r\n    our being brought before it.\r\n\r\n\r\nThey then sat down and refused to answer any question put to them.\r\n\r\nThe judge was utterly nonplussed by this situation. He said that he\r\nwould call a recess of fifteen minutes to consider the question of\r\ncontempt. Among the spectators who packed the room was a lawyer—a\r\nvisitor in Washington. He extracted a great deal of enjoyment out of\r\nthis occasion, because, he said, “if the women are not afraid of jail,\r\nthere is nothing the judge can do.” He awaited the judge’s decision with\r\nan entertained anticipation. Apparently the judge came to the same\r\ndecision, for at the end of fifteen minutes, the Court reconvened and\r\nthe trial went on as though nothing had happened.\r\n\r\nThe women refused to rise when charged. They refused to plead Guilty or\r\nNot Guilty. They sat and read, or knitted, or, as the proceedings bored\r\nthem, fell asleep. The Park Police were, of course, the only witnesses.\r\nAt last all the women whom they could identify were found Guilty. They\r\nwere sentenced to pay fines of five or ten dollars or to serve in prison\r\nten or fifteen days. They all refused to pay the fine. Mary Winsor said:\r\n“It is quite enough to pay taxes when you are not represented, let alone\r\npay a fine if you object to this arrangement.” The prisoners were then\r\nbundled in the Black Maria and taken off to prison.\r\n\r\nBefore the pickets were released from prison at the end of the previous\r\nyear, Superintendent Zinkham said to them:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Now don’t come back, for, if you do, I will have a far worse place\r\n    than the jail fixed up for you. I will have the old workhouse fixed\r\n    up for you, and you will have cells without sunlight, with windows\r\n    high up from the ground. You won’t be as comfortable as you are\r\n    here.\r\n\r\n\r\nEverything happened as Superintendent Zinkham prophesied, and a great\r\ndeal more that was worse. The old workhouse which he had promised them\r\nhad been condemned in Roosevelt’s Administration, and had not been used\r\nfor years. The lower tier of cells was below the level of the ground.\r\nThe doors of the cells were partly of solid steel and only partly of\r\ngrating, so that little light penetrated. The wash basin was small and\r\ninadequate. The toilet was open, the cots were of iron and without\r\nsprings, and with a thin straw mattress on them. Outside, they left\r\nbehind a day so hot as to be almost insupportable, but in the Workhouse,\r\nit was so cold that their teeth chattered. It was damp all the time.\r\nWhen the present writer visited this old Workhouse in October, 1919,\r\nbeads of water hung on everything. The walls were like the outside of an\r\nice water pitcher in summer. Several of the pickets developed\r\nrheumatism. But the unendurable thing about it was the stench which came\r\nin great gusts; component of all that its past history had left behind\r\nand of the closeness of the unaired atmosphere. Apparently something was\r\nwrong with the water, or perhaps it was that the pipes had not been used\r\nfor years. Most of the women believe they suffered with lead poisoning.\r\nThey ached all over; endured a violent nausea; chills.\r\n\r\nHowever, all the twenty-six, with the exception of two elderly women,\r\nwent on hunger-strikes. Lucy Burns presented a demand on behalf of the\r\nentire company to Superintendent Zinkham. She said: “We must have\r\ntwenty-three more blankets and twenty-three hot-water bottles. This\r\nplace is cold and unfit for human habitation.”\r\n\r\n“I know it is cold and damp,” he replied, “but you can all get out of\r\nhere by paying your fines.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Woman’s Party showed their usual ingenuity in bringing these\r\nconditions before the public. As fast as women were arrested, their\r\nState Senators and Representatives were besieged by letters and\r\ntelegrams from home urging them to go to see these imprisoned\r\nconstituents. The Press of their district made editorial question or\r\ncomment. As long as this imprisoning of the pickets continued, there was\r\na file of Representatives and Senators visiting the victims. Senator\r\nJones of Washington was the first outside visitor to see them.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, another meeting of protest, held at the Lafayette\r\nMonument on August 12, with the same speakers and many of the same\r\nbanner bearers, was broken up by the police.\r\n\r\nA curious feature of this case was that at Police Headquarters the\r\npolice decided to confiscate, along with the banners, the Suffragist\r\nregalia—a sash of purple, white, and gold without any lettering\r\nwhatever. The women refused to relinquish these sashes, and there was in\r\nevery case a struggle, in which wrists were twisted, fingers sprained;\r\nbruises and cuts of all kinds administered. All the thirty-eight women\r\nwere, however, released unconditionally.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn August 14, the women held two meetings of protest at the Lafayette\r\nMonument—one at half-past four in the afternoon, and one at eight\r\no’clock in the evening.\r\n\r\nThis double protest came about in this way.\r\n\r\nAt the afternoon demonstration, the women were immediately arrested.\r\nThey were held at Police Headquarters for two hours. The authorities\r\nfeeling then that the hour was too late for further demonstrations,\r\nreleased them. They did not require bail, or a promise to appear in\r\nCourt.\r\n\r\nThe women went at once to Headquarters, snatched a hasty dinner; slipped\r\nquietly out of the building, and marched to the Lafayette Monument.\r\nEverybody agrees that this evening demonstration was very beautiful. It\r\nwas held in the soft dusk of the Washington August. The crescent moon,\r\nwhich seemed tangled in the trees of the park, gave enough light to\r\nbring out the Suffrage tri-color and the Stars and Stripes. As the women\r\ngathered closer and closer around the statue, the effect was of color,\r\nsmudged with shadow; of shadow illuminated with color.\r\n\r\nElsie Hill, carrying the American flag in one hand, and the purple,\r\nwhite, and gold banner in the other spoke first; spoke wonderfully—as\r\nElsie Hill always spoke. She said in part:\r\n\r\n\r\n    We know that our protest is in harmony with the belief of President\r\n    Wilson, for he has stood before the world for the right of the\r\n    governed to a voice in their own government. We resent the fact that\r\n    the soldiers of our country, the men drafted to fight Prussia\r\n    abroad, are used instead to help still the demand of American women\r\n    for political freedom. We resent the suppression of our demands but\r\n    our voices will carry across the country and down through time. The\r\n    world will know that the women of America demand the passage of the\r\n    Federal Suffrage Amendment and that the President insists that the\r\n    Senate act.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were only two policemen on duty. For two policemen to try to\r\narrest nine lively and athletic pickets was a little like a scene in\r\n_Alice in Wonderland_. They would pull one woman down from the statue,\r\nstart to get another, whereupon the first would be back again with her\r\nflying banner.\r\n\r\nFinally, the police reserves arrived, but every woman had managed to\r\nmake a speech.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhile the Suffragists were still in the old Workhouse, Alice Paul,\r\nfollowing her usual system of complete publicity, had announced another\r\nprotest meeting at the Lafayette Monument.\r\n\r\nLater Alice Paul received a letter from Colonel Ridley:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I have been advised that you desire to hold a demonstration in\r\n    Lafayette Square on Thursday, August 22. By direction of the Chief\r\n    of Engineers, U. S. Army, you are hereby granted permission to hold\r\n    this demonstration. You are advised good order must prevail.\r\n\r\n\r\nMiss Paul replied:\r\n\r\n\r\n    We received yesterday your permit for a Suffrage demonstration in\r\n    Lafayette Park this afternoon, and are very glad that our meetings\r\n    are no longer to be interfered with. Because of the illness of so\r\n    many of our members, due to their treatment in prison this last\r\n    week, and with the necessity of caring for them at Headquarters, we\r\n    are planning to hold our next meeting a little later. We have not\r\n    determined on the exact date but we will inform you of the time as\r\n    soon as it is decided upon.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a result of the first series of protest meetings, the Administration\r\nhad yielded to the point of no longer interfering with the meetings at\r\nthe Lafayette Monument. But as time went by and neither the Senate nor\r\nthe President did anything about Suffrage, the National Woman’s Party\r\nannounced that a protest meeting would be held at the Lafayette Monument\r\non September 16 at four o’clock. Immediately the President announced\r\nthat he would receive a delegation of Southern and Western Democratic\r\nwomen that day at two.\r\n\r\nThe same day, September 16, as Maud Younger was coming back from the\r\nCapitol to Headquarters, Senator Overman of the Rules Committee came and\r\nsat by her in the car. In the course of his conversation, he remarked\r\ncasually: “I don’t think your bill is coming up this session.”\r\n\r\nThat afternoon, Abby Scott Baker went to see Senator Jones of New\r\nMexico, Chairman of the Suffrage Committee, to ask him to call a meeting\r\nof the Committee to bring Suffrage to the vote. Senator Jones refused.\r\nHe said he would not bring up the Suffrage Amendment at this session in\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nWhen—still later—that delegation of Southern and Western Democratic\r\nwomen called on the President, he said to them:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I am, as I think you know, heartily in sympathy with you. I have\r\n    endeavored to assist you in every way in my power, and I shall\r\n    continue to do so. I shall do all that I can to assist the passage\r\n    of the Amendment by an early vote.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was the final touch.\r\n\r\nThe National Woman’s Party hastily changed the type of its\r\ndemonstration. Instead of holding a mere meeting of protest, they\r\ndecided to burn the words which the President had said that very\r\nafternoon to the Southern and Western Democratic women. At four o’clock\r\ninstead of two, forty women marched from Headquarters to the Lafayette\r\nMonument. They carried the famous banners: HOW LONG MUST WOMEN WAIT FOR\r\nLIBERTY? MR. PRESIDENT, WHAT WILL YOU DO FOR WOMAN SUFFRAGE? At the\r\nLafayette statue, Bertha Arnold delivered an appeal to Lafayette,\r\nwritten by Mrs. Richard Wainwright and beginning with the famous words\r\nof Pershing in France:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Lafayette, we are here!\r\n\r\n    We, the women of the United States, denied the liberty which you\r\n    helped to gain, and for which we have asked in vain for sixty years,\r\n    turn to you to plead for us.\r\n\r\n    Speak, Lafayette! Dead these hundred years but still living in the\r\n    hearts of the American people. Speak again to plead for us,\r\n    condemned like the bronze woman at your feet, to a silent appeal.\r\n    She offers you a sword. Will you not use the sword of the spirit,\r\n    mightier far than the sword she holds out to you?\r\n\r\n    Will you not ask the great leader of our democracy to look upon the\r\n    failure of our beloved country to be in truth the place where every\r\n    one is free and equal and entitled to a share in the government? Let\r\n    that outstretched hand of yours pointing to the White House recall\r\n    to him his words and promises, his trumpet call for all of us to see\r\n    that the world is made safe for democracy.\r\n\r\n    As our army now in France spoke to you there, saying, “Here we are\r\n    to help your country fight for liberty,” will you not speak here and\r\n    now for us, a little band with no army, no power but justice and\r\n    right, no strength but in our Constitution and the Declaration of\r\n    Independence, and win a great victory again in this country by\r\n    giving us the opportunity we ask to be heard through the Susan B.\r\n    Anthony Amendment?\r\n\r\n    Lafayette, we are here!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe police, having no orders to arrest the women, smiled and nodded. And\r\nwhile the crowd that had very quickly gathered applauded, Lucy Branham\r\nstepped forward. Beside her was Julia Emory, holding a flaming torch.\r\n\r\n“We want action,” Miss Branham stated simply, “not words.” She took the\r\ntorch from Julia Emory, held the words of the President’s message of\r\nthat afternoon in the flames. As it burned, she said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The torch which I hold symbolizes the burning indignation of women\r\n    who for a hundred years have been given words without action. In the\r\n    spring our hopes were raised by words much like these from President\r\n    Wilson, yet they were permitted to be followed by a filibuster\r\n    against our Amendment on the part of the Democratic Senate leaders.\r\n\r\n    President Wilson still refuses any real support to the movement for\r\n    the political freedom of women....\r\n\r\n    We, therefore, take these empty words, spoken by President Wilson\r\n    this afternoon, and consign them to the flames.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LUCY BRANHAM BURNING THE PRESIDENT’S WORDS AT THE\r\nLAFAYETTE MONUMENT.\r\nPhoto Copr. Harris and Ewing, Washington, D. C.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE RUSSIAN ENVOY BANNER, AUGUST, 1917.\r\nPhoto Copr. Harris and Ewing, Washington, D. C.]\r\n\r\n\r\n    This is a symbol of the indignation of American women at the\r\n    treatment given by the President to their plea for democracy.\r\n\r\n    We have protested to this Administration by banners; we have\r\n    protested by speeches; we now protest by this symbolic act.\r\n\r\n    As in the ancient fights for liberty the crusaders for freedom\r\n    symbolized their protest against those responsible for injustice by\r\n    consigning their hollow phrases to the flames, so we, on behalf of\r\n    thousands of Suffragists, in this same way today, protest against\r\n    the action of the President and his Party in delaying the liberation\r\n    of American women.\r\n\r\n    For five years, women have appealed to this President and his Party\r\n    for political freedom. The President has given words, and words, and\r\n    words. Today, women receive more words. We announce to the President\r\n    and the whole world today, by this act of ours, our determination\r\n    that words shall no longer be the only reply given to American\r\n    women—our determination that this same democracy, for whose\r\n    establishment abroad we are making the utmost sacrifice, shall also\r\n    prevail at home.\r\n\r\n\r\nApplause greeted these spirited words. As Jessie Hardy Mackaye started\r\nto speak, a man in the crowd handed her a twenty-dollar bill for the\r\nWoman’s Party. Others began passing money to her. The Suffragists were\r\nbusy running through the crowd collecting it. The crowd continued to\r\napplaud and cheer.\r\n\r\nMrs. Mackaye said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Against the twofold attitude on the part of the Senate toward\r\n    democracy, I protest with all the power of my being. The same\r\n    Congress and the same Administration that are appropriating billions\r\n    of dollars and enlisting the services of millions of men to\r\n    establish democracy in Europe, is at the same time refusing to do so\r\n    common a piece of justice as to vote to submit the Woman Suffrage\r\n    Amendment to the States.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was the first time the President’s words were burned.\r\n\r\nThe President’s car drove up to the door during the progress of this\r\ndemonstration, and President Wilson stepped in. But instead of going out\r\nat the usual gate, the driver turned the car about, so that he could\r\nmake his exit elsewhere.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  VII\r\n\r\n   THE PRESIDENT APPEALS TO THE SENATE TO PASS THE SUFFRAGE AMENDMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE very next day occurred a remarkable example of direct action: that\r\ndirect action coming within twenty-four hours. Senator Jones, who the\r\nday before had refused to bring up Suffrage in this session, arose in\r\nthe Senate and announced that on September 26, he would move to take up\r\nthe Suffrage Amendment, and keep it before the Senate until a vote was\r\nreached.\r\n\r\nWith this promise of definite action, the Woman’s Party immediately\r\nceased their demonstrations.\r\n\r\nOn September 26, Senator Jones brought the Amendment up. Maud Younger\r\nsays, in her _Revelations of a Woman Lobbyist_:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Discussion began. Discussion went on. For five whole days it lasted,\r\n    with waves of hope and waves of dismay, and always an undercurrent\r\n    of uncertainty. Thursday, Friday, Saturday, the speeches went on. On\r\n    Monday word went forth that the President would address the Senate\r\n    on behalf of our Amendment.\r\n\r\n    I hurried to Senator Curtis, who was in his office signing letters.\r\n    He said: “The other side claim that they have their men pledged:\r\n    that the President comes too late. What do you expect?”\r\n\r\n    “I don’t know what I should expect. I hope.”\r\n\r\n    I went over to the Senate. There was very great excitement; a sense\r\n    of something wonderful impending. On the floor there was the\r\n    ceremonious atmosphere that attends the President’s coming.\r\n\r\n    “Look,” said a newspaper man in the gallery beside me, “he’s brought\r\n    all his heavy artillery with him.” There on the floor of the Senate\r\n    were the members of the Cabinet. Lesser dignitaries were scattered\r\n    about the room. Congressmen stood, two-deep, lining the walls. The\r\n    Sergeant-at-Arms announced in clear tones: “The President of the\r\n    United States.”\r\n\r\n    The President came in, shook hands with the presiding officer,\r\n    turned and read his speech. There is always an evenness about his\r\n    public utterances, in manner, in voice, in reading; yet I thought he\r\n    read this message with more feeling than his War message, or his\r\n    Fourteen Points.\r\n\r\n    The President said:\r\n\r\n    Gentlemen of the Senate: The unusual circumstances of a world war in\r\n    which we stand and are judged in the view not only of our own people\r\n    and our own consciences but also in the view of all nations and\r\n    peoples will, I hope, justify in your thought, as it does in mine,\r\n    the message I have come to bring you.\r\n\r\n    I regard the concurrence of the Senate in the constitutional\r\n    Amendment proposing the extension of the Suffrage to women as\r\n    vitally essential to the successful prosecution of the great war of\r\n    humanity in which we are engaged. I have come to urge upon you the\r\n    considerations which have led me to that conclusion. It is not only\r\n    my privilege, it is also my duty to apprise you of every\r\n    circumstance and element involved in this momentous struggle which\r\n    seems to me to affect its very processes and its outcome. It is my\r\n    duty to win the war and to ask you to remove every obstacle that\r\n    stands in the way of winning it.\r\n\r\n    I had assumed that the Senate would concur in the Amendment because\r\n    no disputable principle is involved but only a question of the\r\n    method by which the Suffrage is to be extended to women. There is\r\n    and can be no Party issue involved in it. Both of our great national\r\n    Parties are pledged, explicitly pledged, to equality of Suffrage for\r\n    the women of the country.\r\n\r\n    Neither Party, therefore, it seems to me, can justify hesitation as\r\n    to the method of obtaining it, can rightfully hesitate to substitute\r\n    Federal initiative for State initiative, if the early adoption of\r\n    this measure is necessary to the successful prosecution of the war\r\n    and if the method of State action proposed in Party platforms of\r\n    1916 is impracticable within any reasonable length of time, if\r\n    practicable at all.\r\n\r\n    And its adoption is, in my judgment, clearly necessary to the\r\n    successful prosecution of the war and the successful realization of\r\n    the object for which the war is being fought.\r\n\r\n    That judgment I take the liberty of urging upon you with solemn\r\n    earnestness for reasons which I shall state very frankly and which I\r\n    shall hope will seem as conclusive to you as they seem to me.\r\n\r\n    This is a peoples’ war and the peoples’ thinking constitutes its\r\n    atmosphere and morale, not the predilections of the drawing-room or\r\n    the political considerations of the caucus.\r\n\r\n    If we be indeed Democrats and wish to lead the world to democracy,\r\n    we can ask other peoples to accept in proof of our sincerity and our\r\n    ability to lead them whither they wish to be led nothing less\r\n    persuasive and convincing than our actions. Our professions will not\r\n    suffice. Verification must be forthcoming when verification is asked\r\n    for. And in this case verification is asked for—asked for in this\r\n    particular matter. You ask by whom?\r\n\r\n    Not through diplomatic channels; not by foreign ministers. Not by\r\n    the intimations of parliaments. It is asked for by the anxious,\r\n    expectant, suffering peoples with whom we are dealing and who are\r\n    willing to put their destinies in some measure in our hands, if they\r\n    are sure that we wish the same things they do.\r\n\r\n    I do not speak by conjecture. It is not alone the voices of\r\n    statesmen and of newspapers that reach me, and the voices of foolish\r\n    and intemperate agitators do not reach me at all. Through many, many\r\n    channels I have been made aware what the plain, struggling, workaday\r\n    folk are thinking upon whom the chief terror and suffering of this\r\n    tragic war falls.\r\n\r\n    They are looking to the great, powerful, famous Democracy of the\r\n    West to lead them to the new day for which they have so long waited;\r\n    and they think in their logical simplicity, that democracy means\r\n    that women shall play their part in affairs alongside men and upon\r\n    an equal footing with them. If we reject measures like this, in\r\n    ignorance or defiance of what a new age has brought forth, of what\r\n    they have seen but we have not, they will cease to believe in us;\r\n    they will cease to follow or to trust us.\r\n\r\n    They have seen their own governments accept this interpretation of\r\n    democracy—seen old governments accept this interpretation of\r\n    democracy—seen old governments like that of Great Britain, which did\r\n    not profess to be democratic, promise readily and as of course this\r\n    justice to women, though they had before refused it, the strange\r\n    revelations of this war having made many things new and plain, to\r\n    governments as well as to people.\r\n\r\n    Are we alone to refuse to learn the lesson? Are we alone to ask and\r\n    take the utmost that our women can give—service and sacrifice of\r\n    every kind—and still say we do not see what title that gives them to\r\n    stand by our sides in the guidance of the affairs of their nation\r\n    and ours?\r\n\r\n    We have made partners of the women in this war; shall we admit them\r\n    only to a partnership of suffering and sacrifice and toil and not a\r\n    partnership of privilege and right? This war could not have been\r\n    fought either by the other nations engaged or by America, if it had\r\n    not been for the services of the women—services rendered in every\r\n    sphere—not merely in the fields of effort in which we have been\r\n    accustomed to see them work, but wherever men have worked, and upon\r\n    the very skirts and edges of the battle itself.\r\n\r\n    We shall not only be distrusted but shall deserve to be distrusted\r\n    if we do not enfranchise them with the fullest possible\r\n    enfranchisement, as it is now certain that the other great free\r\n    nations will enfranchise them.\r\n\r\n    We cannot isolate our thought and action in such a matter from the\r\n    thought of the rest of the world. We must either conform or\r\n    deliberately reject what they propose and resign the leadership of\r\n    liberal minds to others.\r\n\r\n    The women of America are too noble and too intelligent and too\r\n    devoted to be slackers whether you give or withhold this thing that\r\n    is mere justice; but I know the magic it will work in their thoughts\r\n    and spirits if you give it to them.\r\n\r\n    I propose it as I would propose to admit soldiers to the Suffrage,\r\n    the men fighting in the field for our liberties and the liberties of\r\n    the world, were they excluded. The task of the woman lies at the\r\n    very heart of the war, and I know how much stronger that heart will\r\n    beat if you do this just thing and show our women that you trust\r\n    them as much as you in fact and of necessity depend upon them.\r\n\r\n    Have I said that the passage of this Amendment is a vitally\r\n    necessary war measure, and do you need further proof? Do you stand\r\n    in need of the trust of other peoples and of the trust of our own\r\n    women? Is that trust an asset or is it not?\r\n\r\n    I tell you plainly, as the commander-in-chief of our armies and of\r\n    the gallant men in our fleets, as the present spokesman of this\r\n    people in our dealings with the men and women throughout the world\r\n    who are now our partners, as the responsible head of a great\r\n    government which stands and is questioned day by day as to its\r\n    purposes, its principles, its hopes, whether they be serviceable to\r\n    men everywhere or only to itself, and who must himself answer these\r\n    questions or be shamed, as the guide and director of forces caught\r\n    in the grip of war and by the same token in need of every material\r\n    and spiritual resource this great nation possesses—I tell you\r\n    plainly that this measure which I urge upon you is vital to the\r\n    winning of the war and to the energies alike of preparation and of\r\n    battle.\r\n\r\n    And not to the winning of the war only. It is vital to the right\r\n    solution of the great problems which we must settle, and settle\r\n    immediately, when the war is over. We shall need then in our vision\r\n    of affairs, as we have never needed them before, the sympathy and\r\n    insight and clear moral instinct of the women of the world. The\r\n    problems of that time will strike to the roots of many things that\r\n    we have not hitherto questioned, and I for one believe that our\r\n    safety in those questioning days, as well as our comprehension of\r\n    matters that touch society to the quick, will depend upon the direct\r\n    and authoritative participation of women in our counsels. We shall\r\n    need their moral sense to preserve what is right and fine and worthy\r\n    in our system of life as well as to discover just what it is that\r\n    ought to be purified and re-formed. Without their counselings we\r\n    shall only be half wise.\r\n\r\n    That is my case. That is my appeal. Many may deny its validity, if\r\n    they choose, but no one can brush aside or answer the arguments upon\r\n    which it is based. The executive tasks of this war rest upon me. I\r\n    ask that you lighten them and place in my hands instruments,\r\n    spiritual instruments, which I do not now possess, which I sorely\r\n    need, and which I have daily to apologize for not being able to\r\n    employ.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this speech, the President had said: “The voices of foolish and\r\nintemperate agitators do not reach me at all.”\r\n\r\nIt was generally felt that the President, there, indicated the Woman’s\r\nParty. Commenting on that phrase the next day, the Republican Senators\r\nremarked, “Why it was that which brought him there!”\r\n\r\nDuring the course of the debate between Poindexter and Pitman,\r\nPoindexter asked, “Wasn’t it the pickets that got the President?”\r\n\r\nThe next afternoon when the vote was called for, and the last Senator\r\nhad answered to his name, the presiding officer announced the result:\r\n\r\n“The joint resolution does not pass.”\r\n\r\nThe Suffrage Amendment still lacked two votes.\r\n\r\nMiss Younger says in her _Revelations of a Lobbyist_:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Stunned, as though unable to grasp it, hundreds of women sat there.\r\n    Then slowly the defeat reached their consciousness, and they began\r\n    slowly to put on their hats, to gather up their wraps, and to file\r\n    out of the galleries, some with a dull sense of injustice, some with\r\n    burning resentment. In the corridors they began to form in groups.\r\n    Every one wanted to discuss it. But Alice Paul took my arm.\r\n\r\n    “Come,” she said, “we must find out about the short-term candidates\r\n    and go into the election campaign at once.”\r\n\r\n\r\nImmediately after the vote was taken and defeated, Senator Jones of New\r\nMexico changed his vote and moved that the measure be reconsidered;\r\nthereby placing it again on the Senate Calendar, ready to be called up\r\nany time and voted on.\r\n\r\nBy going to the Senate in this manner, the President had made his own\r\nrecord clean to the country at large. But he had not made it clean to\r\nthe National Woman’s Party, because, although he had done something, he\r\nhad not done enough. He appeared to be doing more than he was, but there\r\nwas a great deal more that he could have done. He did not, for instance,\r\nstart his appeal to the Senate early enough. That appeal came only a\r\nfortnight before the vote was taken. Possibly he had underestimated the\r\nopposition; probably he had overestimated the strength of his own\r\ninfluence. But the country at large of course did not understand that.\r\nFor the time being, therefore, the Woman’s Party concentrated their\r\ndrive on another point in the enemy line.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  VIII\r\n\r\n                          PICKETING THE SENATE\r\n\r\n\r\nAS the Senate was still sitting and could at any time reverse its action\r\nin regard to the Suffrage Amendment, the Woman’s Party decided to\r\nprotest against its defeat of the Amendment and to demand a reversal.\r\n\r\nThey began to picket the Senate and in especial the thirty-four Senators\r\nwhose adverse vote had again delayed the passage of the Amendment.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of October 7, four banner bearers ascended the steps of\r\nthe Capitol. They were: Elizabeth Kalb; Vivian Pierce; Bertha Moller;\r\nMrs. Horton Pope. The lettered banner, flanked as usual with the\r\nSuffrage tri-color, read:\r\n\r\n           WE DEMAND AN AMENDMENT TO THE UNITED CONSTITUTION\r\n                          ENFRANCHISING WOMEN.\r\n\r\nThey had hardly mounted the steps when the Capitol police placed them\r\nunder arrest. They took the prisoners to the guard room in the Capitol,\r\nkept them there for fifteen minutes, and then released them. It was, of\r\ncourse, not exactly an arrest; and no one seemed exactly responsible for\r\nthe order. The banners were, however, confiscated.\r\n\r\nThat afternoon, the same women, except that Bertha Arnold was\r\nsubstituted for Mrs. Pope, mounted the steps bearing a large banner\r\nwhich read:\r\n\r\n           WE PROTEST AGAINST THE 34 WILFUL SENATORS WHO HAVE\r\n            DELAYED THE POLITICAL FREEDOM OF AMERICAN WOMEN.\r\n         THEY HAVE OBSTRUCTED THE WAR PROGRAM OF THE PRESIDENT.\r\n             THEY HAVE LINED UP THE SENATE WITH PRUSSIA BY\r\n                 DENYING SELF-GOVERNMENT TO THE PEOPLE.\r\n\r\nAll the afternoon, the banner bearers were detained in the courtroom at\r\nintervals. When they were released, they went back to the Capitol; were\r\narrested; detained in the courtroom again; released again.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of October 10, four more pickets, Edith Ainge, Bertha\r\nMoller, Maud Jamison, Clara Wold, started for the Capitol. Crowds of men\r\nand women gathered in the park to see what was going to happen, and rows\r\nof police stood on the Capitol steps awaiting the pickets. As soon as\r\nthe big protest banner was unfurled, the police seized it. Maud Jamison\r\nand Clara Wold tried to mount the steps with the tri-color, but several\r\npolicemen rushed upon them, and conducted them up the steps and into the\r\nCapitol building. As the police said over and over again that there were\r\nno arrests, the women insisted on carrying their banners.\r\n\r\nProtesting against the curious and inconsistent action on the part of\r\nthe police, the women were conducted into the presence of the captain.\r\nHe iterated and reiterated that this action was all in accordance with\r\nthe rules of Colonel Higgins, the Democratic Sergeant-at-Arms who is\r\nunder the Rules Committee which carries out the Democratic program. The\r\nSuffragists demanded by what authority they were held and the captain\r\ninformed them that it did not make any difference about the law, that\r\nColonel Higgins had taken the law into his own hands. The four\r\nSuffragists waited for a few minutes. Their purple, white, and gold\r\nbanners had been confiscated, but the protest banner was still there.\r\nSuddenly, without any interference from anybody, they took up their\r\nprotest banner, walked out of the guard room, went over to the Senate\r\nOffice Building and stood with it, at the top of the steps, the rest of\r\nthe day. Later Vivian Pierce, Mrs. Stewart Polk, Mary Gertrude Fendall\r\nand Gladys Greiner joined this group of pickets.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, other Suffragists were trying vainly to take the\r\nSuffrage colors to the Capitol steps. They walked from the Office\r\nBuilding on to the Plaza by twos. The instant they appeared, policemen,\r\nrushing down the steps, rushing from the curb, rushing from the crowd\r\nwhich had gathered, seized them. They tried to wrench the banners away;\r\nand this was, of course, an unequal contest, in which sometimes the\r\nwomen were pulled completely off the ground and always their wrists\r\npainfully twisted. But the women clung to the banners, walked as calmly\r\nas the situation permitted into the Capitol, and down to the guard room.\r\nHere the banners were always confiscated, but they, themselves, were\r\nreleased. If anybody in the crowd showed any disposition to resent the\r\nattitude of the police, he was placed under arrest too; but he also was\r\nreleased.\r\n\r\nOn October 11 the Suffragists picketed only the Senate Office Building,\r\nas Congress was not in session. At the beginning of the day, Mrs. George\r\nAtwater and Betty Cram held the banners. Mrs. Atwater’s two little\r\ngirls, Edith and Barbara, assisted their mother by holding the\r\ntri-colors.\r\n\r\nOthers who picketed that day were: Grace Needham, Mrs. George Odell,\r\nElizabeth Kalb, Virginia Arnold, Mary Gertrude Fendall, Gladys Greiner,\r\nMaud Jamison, Vivian Pierce, Bertha Moller, Clara Wold.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn October 13, plans for another demonstration were announced in the\r\nWashington papers. _Edith Ainge, bearing the American flag, was to lead\r\na procession of Suffragists on to the Senate floor._ There the words of\r\nthe anti-Suffrage Senators in praise of democracy were to be burned. For\r\nan hour before the line formed, the Capitol police were lined up, ready\r\nfor the pickets. Above, Senators hung over the balcony where they could\r\nwitness the demonstration. Below, motor after motor drove up to the curb\r\nand stopped, waiting to see what was going to happen. At length, the\r\nSuffragists arrived. They formed in line outside the Senate Office\r\nBuilding, and started towards the Capitol. They were beset by a\r\nbattalion of police, and taken to the guard room. Women standing in the\r\ncrowd, who were not in the procession, but who wore the Suffrage colors\r\nwere taken along also. Alice Paul, who wore no regalia of any kind, was\r\ncaught in the net.\r\n\r\nThese women were: Alice Paul; Vivian Pierce; Bertha Moller; Bertha\r\nArnold; Elizabeth McShane; Edith Ainge; Edith Hilles; Julia Emory; Clara\r\nWold; Elizabeth Kalb; Virginia Arnold; Grace Frost; Matilda Young; Mrs.\r\nK. G. Winston.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Woman’s Party now decided to open a “banner” campaign on each of the\r\nSenators who had helped to defeat the Suffrage Amendment. They began\r\nwith Senator Wadsworth. They unrolled on the steps of the Senate Office\r\nBuilding a banner which read:\r\n\r\n              SENATOR WADSWORTH’S REGIMENT IS FIGHTING FOR\r\n                           DEMOCRACY ABROAD.\r\n          SENATOR WADSWORTH LEFT HIS REGIMENT AND IS FIGHTING\r\n                    AGAINST DEMOCRACY IN THE SENATE.\r\n          SENATOR WADSWORTH COULD SERVE HIS COUNTRY BETTER BY\r\n               FIGHTING WITH HIS REGIMENT ABROAD THAN BY\r\n                            FIGHTING WOMEN.\r\n\r\nLater appeared another banner, proclaiming the case of Senator Shields:\r\n\r\n            SENATOR SHIELDS TOLD THE PEOPLE OF TENNESSEE HE\r\n         WOULD SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT’S POLICIES. THE ONLY TIME\r\n          THE PRESIDENT WENT TO THE SENATE TO ASK ITS SUPPORT,\r\n         SENATOR SHIELDS VOTED AGAINST HIM. DOES TENNESSEE BACK\r\n            THE PRESIDENT’S WAR PROGRAM OR SENATOR SHIELDS?\r\n\r\nThese banners were taken up by the newspapers of the Senators’ States\r\nand focussed unfavorable attention upon them.\r\n\r\nBy this time, the Capitol police had found that their system of\r\narresting and detaining what threatened to prove an inexhaustible army\r\nof Suffragists was futile. So now they reverted to their policy of 1917.\r\nThey stood aside and let the crowd worry the Suffragists. Mainly,\r\nhowever, these were small boys, who seized the banners and dragged them\r\nthrough the streets.\r\n\r\nOn October 23 appeared:\r\n\r\n           GERMANY HAS ESTABLISHED “EQUAL, UNIVERSAL, SECRET,\r\n        DIRECT FRANCHISE.” THE SENATE HAS DENIED EQUAL UNIVERSAL\r\n           SUFFRAGE TO AMERICA. WHICH IS MORE OF A DEMOCRACY,\r\n                          GERMANY OR AMERICA?\r\n\r\nThe small boys, generally office boys, were allowed to tear up this\r\nbanner too.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn October 24, Julia Emory and Virginia Arnold succeeded in getting to\r\nthe top of the Capitol steps, unseen by the police who were grouped on\r\nthe sidewalk. Their banner said:\r\n\r\n            WE CONDEMN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. THE DEMOCRATIC\r\n           PARTY DEFEATED SUFFRAGE. THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS\r\n            PLACED AMERICA BEHIND GERMANY AS A DEMOCRACY, IF\r\n        GERMANY HAS, AS SHE SAYS, ESTABLISHED EQUAL, UNIVERSAL,\r\n                       SECRET, DIRECT FRANCHISE.\r\n\r\nThe instant they caught sight of this banner, the policemen took the two\r\ngirls to the guard room, where they held them, until half-past seven\r\nthat evening.\r\n\r\nOn October 25, as the Senate was not in session, the pickets returned to\r\nthe Office Building, where hitherto they had been unmolested. There were\r\nfour of them, and they carried the Great Demand banner. They were\r\narrested, and held until six o’clock. They went back to the Capitol at\r\neight in the evening, and were again arrested, and held until eleven\r\no’clock. Friends or newspaper men, calling at the Capitol, could get no\r\ninformation about them. On various pretexts, the telephone answered\r\nnothing. These women were Matilda Young; Elizabeth Kalb; Julia Emory;\r\nVirginia Arnold.\r\n\r\nOn October 26, eight pickets bore the Wadsworth and Shields banners with\r\nthe tri-color. As usual, the poles of their banners were broken; their\r\nbanners themselves snatched from them; they were seized and held.\r\n\r\nThat afternoon, there was an aeroplane demonstration in Washington.\r\nSeven pickets went out with banners: Julia Emory, Maud Jamison, Bertha\r\nArnold, Katherine Fisher, Minna Lederman, Elizabeth Kalb, Mrs. Frances\r\nDavies. They were handled with great roughness. Maud Jamison was knocked\r\nsenseless by a policeman. Several men in uniform protested to the\r\npolice.\r\n\r\nOn October 28, twenty-one women, each bearing the purple, white, and\r\ngold banners, started for the Capitol. They marched a banner’s length\r\napart across the Capitol grounds.\r\n\r\nThey had gone halfway up the steps, when policemen in plain clothes\r\nappeared from all sides and grappled with them. Many women were injured.\r\nAnnie Arniel was thrown to the ground so violently that she fainted. An\r\nambulance was summoned to take her to the hospital. The other women were\r\nlocked in a basement room until six o’clock, when they were released.\r\nThey were escorted through the Capitol grounds by a member of the\r\nvigilant force of guards. He bore the American flag which had been\r\ncarried at the head of their line. As they reached the limit of the\r\nCapitol grounds, he returned that to them, but all the lettered banners\r\nand tri-colors were retained.\r\n\r\nThe twenty-one women were: Edith Ainge; Harriet U. Andrews; Bertha\r\nArnold; Virginia Arnold; Annie Arniel; Olive Beale; Lucy Burns; Eleanor\r\nCalnan; L. G. C. Daniels; Frances Davis; Julia Emory; Mary Gertrude\r\nFendall; Mrs. Gilson Gardner; Sara Grogan; Maud Jamison; Elizabeth Kalb;\r\nAugusta M. Kelley; Lola Maverick Lloyd; Matilda Young; H. R. Walmsley;\r\nAlice Paul.\r\n\r\nOn October 29, two pickets went to the Capitol with a banner inscribed:\r\n\r\n               RESISTANCE TO TYRANNY IS OBEDIENCE TO GOD.\r\n\r\nThey were seized and held until the afternoon.\r\n\r\nBy some divagation in the police policy, they were seized, while they\r\nwere walking to the car after their release, and held for another hour.\r\n\r\nOn October 30, five pickets, carrying the Senator Baird banner and three\r\ntri-colors, picketed the north front of the Capitol for an hour. Then\r\nthey marched to the south front, determined to take up their stand on\r\nthe Senate steps. Halfway in their progress, they were seized, locked\r\nup, and held until six o’clock.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIndignant at these arrests without charge, the National Woman’s Party\r\ndecided to protest the next day—Thursday.\r\n\r\nOn October 31, therefore, after the usual morning arrest, their lawyer\r\napplied to Judge Siddons of the District Supreme Court for a writ of\r\nhabeas corpus. The Judge declared that the sergeant-at-arms had no right\r\nto hold any one without a charge, that he must either make a charge, or\r\nrelease the Suffragists. The sergeant-at-arms released them at once.\r\nNevertheless, when the pickets returned in the afternoon, they were\r\nseized in the usual violent fashion and conducted to the guard room.\r\nHowever, although their banners were not returned to them, they were\r\ndetained but a few minutes. On Friday, they were released as soon as\r\ntheir banners were seized. Fresh banners appeared from time to time all\r\nday long. Again consulted, Judge Siddons said that the police had no\r\nright to keep the banners. On Saturday, however, the police did not have\r\nto seize the banners; there appeared a variation in the picket line. A\r\ngroup of women walked up and down in front of the Senate Office\r\nBuilding. They bore no lettered banners; they bore no tri-colors; but\r\nthey wore on their arms black mourning bands—in commemoration of the\r\ndeath of justice in the United States Senate.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn November 21, the Senate declared a recess without considering the\r\nFederal Suffrage Amendment. That day, twelve pickets protested against\r\nthe recess, marching from the Senate Office Building to the Capitol.\r\nThey were: Alice Paul, Mrs. Lawrence Lewis, Elizabeth Kalb, Clara Wold,\r\nBertha Arnold, Sara Grogan, Julia Emory, Anita Pollitzer, Matilda Young,\r\nMrs. Nicholas Kelly, Olive Beale, Maud Jamison.\r\n\r\nThey carried a banner which read:\r\n\r\n         AMERICAN WOMEN PROTEST AGAINST THE SENATE’S RECESSING\r\n                WITHOUT PASSING THE SUFFRAGE AMENDMENT.\r\n\r\n            AMERICA ENTERS THE PEACE CONFERENCE WITH UNCLEAN\r\n              HANDS FOR DEMOCRACY IS DENIED TO HER PEOPLE.\r\n\r\n          THE NATIONS OF THE WORLD CANNOT TRUST HER MEDIATION\r\n             IF SHE PREACHES DEMOCRACY FOR ALL EUROPE WHILE\r\n        AMERICANS ARE ARRESTED FOR ASKING FOR IT AT THE CAPITOL.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion, the women were treated outrageously. The police, two\r\nto a picket, pounced upon them as they approached the Capitol. One was\r\nheard to call, “Help! Help! They’re coming!” Clara Wold was knocked down\r\ntwice on the Senate steps; was shaken like a rat. They dragged and\r\npushed Alice Paul about as though personally enraged with her. When they\r\nwere taken into the basement room of the Capitol a crowd of indignant\r\nmen and women followed. Policeman No. 21 threatened to arrest a man in\r\nthe crowd because he said: “Sure! I believe in Woman Suffrage.”\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   IX\r\n\r\n                  THE THIRD APPEAL TO THE WOMEN VOTERS\r\n\r\n\r\nALL during this period, the National Woman’s Party was, of course,\r\ntaking its part in the autumn campaign—the campaign of 1918. It was in\r\nthe Senatorial elections only that the Woman’s Party was interested. The\r\nexpedient quality of Alice Paul’s policy manifested itself notably here.\r\nIt has been shown again and again how swift she was to adapt the tactics\r\nof the Woman’s Party to the needs of the moment. The Woman’s Party, it\r\nmust always be remembered, was organized for but one object—to\r\nenfranchise the women of the United States by federal amendment. Other\r\nSuffrage organizations could and did divide their interests; could and\r\ndid deflect their forces for those interests. On this point, Alice Paul\r\nnever swerved. But as has been again and again demonstrated, she was as\r\nfluid as water, as swift as light, to adapt that single adamantine\r\npolicy to the situation of the moment. At this juncture she extended her\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances were these:\r\n\r\nIn the Senate, Suffrage needed two more votes.\r\n\r\nIn the West, as usual, the Woman’s Party asked the women voters to\r\ndefeat the Democrats as the Party in power and therefore the Party\r\nresponsible. In two States in the East—New Jersey and New\r\nHampshire—where the Republican candidates were anti-Suffragists and the\r\nDemocratic candidates were Suffragists, the Woman’s Party supported the\r\nDemocratic candidates.\r\n\r\nThat campaign, short as it was, was intensive. In the West Elsie Hill\r\ntook care of Nevada; Catherine Flanagan of Montana; Anita Pollitzer of\r\nWyoming; Clara Wold of Oregon; Louise Garnett of Kansas; Iris Calderhead\r\nof Colorado. In the East, Doris Stevens, Betty Gram, Bertha Arnold, Ruth\r\nSmall, Rebecca Hourwich, Vivian Pierce, Bertha Moller, Lucy Branham,\r\nCaroline Katzenstein, Florence Bayard Hilles, Agnes Morey, Gladys\r\nGreiner, Maud Younger, Mary Beard, Abby Scott Baker, Mary Dubrow, Grace\r\nNeedham, Lucy Burns, Mrs. Lawrence Lewis, Katherine Morey took care of\r\nNew Jersey and New Hampshire.\r\n\r\nThe two vacancies in the Senate from New Jersey and New Hampshire had\r\nbeen caused by death. The Senators who would take those seats in\r\nNovember would fill out the remainder of the Congress then in Session.\r\nIn New Jersey the Republican candidate—Senator Baird—had voted against\r\nthe Suffrage Amendment in the Senate on October 1. The Democratic\r\ncandidate—Charles O’Connor Hennessy—had fought all his public life in\r\nNew Jersey for National Woman Suffrage.\r\n\r\nIn New Hampshire the Republican candidate—George H. Moses—was an\r\nanti-Suffragist. The Democratic candidate—John B. Jameson—was for the\r\nFederal Amendment.\r\n\r\nThe National Woman’s Party thought of course the President would assist\r\nthem in their campaign for Hennessy and Jameson, as they were both\r\nDemocrats as well as Suffragists and, in particular, because he had just\r\ntold the Senate that the passing of the Federal Amendment was necessary\r\nto the successful prosecution of the war. But he gave them no help until\r\nthe Woman’s Party forced him to do so, and then it was too late. But\r\nwhen the news came back from the Suffrage States of the West that the\r\nWoman’s Party speakers were telling of his inaction, he sent—in the last\r\nweek in October—the following letter to Hennessy of New Jersey:\r\n\r\n\r\n    May I not say how deeply interested I am in the contest you are\r\n    conducting? I cannot but feel that in ignoring my earnest appeal\r\n    with regard to the Suffrage Amendment, made in public interest, and\r\n    because of my intimate knowledge of the issues involved both on the\r\n    other side of the water and here, Senator Baird has certainly not\r\n    represented the true feeling and spirit of the people of New Jersey.\r\n\r\n    I am sure that they must have felt that such an appeal could not and\r\n    should not be ignored. It would be a very great make-weight, thrown\r\n    into the international scale, if his course of action while in the\r\n    Senate could be reversed by the people of our great State.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, before the end of the campaign, the President came out in a\r\nstatement endorsing Jameson. But he did not work so hard to elect these\r\ntwo Democrats, who were also Suffragists, as he did to defeat Vardaman\r\nand Hardwick, both of whom were Democrats and one a Suffragist. Hennessy\r\nand Jameson were both defeated. In the West, the election resulted in\r\nthe defeat of Senator Shafroth of Colorado, thereby handing the Senate\r\nover to the Republicans. The defeat of Shafroth is universally ascribed\r\nto the Woman’s Party. The Woman’s Party believed that this election had\r\nbrought them one vote, Pollock of South Carolina.\r\n\r\nThe Borah incident of the campaign of 1918 is a black page in the record\r\nof any gentleman who has Presidential aspirations. Catherine Flanagan\r\nand Margaret Whittemore were campaigning in western Idaho, asking the\r\nIdaho people to bring pressure on Borah to vote for Suffrage.\r\n\r\nShortly after casting his vote against the Federal Amendment, Borah came\r\nto Headquarters to see Alice Paul. He said that that vote represented\r\nhis personal belief, but that in the future he would have to be bound by\r\nthe Idaho Party (Republican) platform which had endorsed the Amendment.\r\nHe said he would not give a public statement as that would look like\r\ntrying to get votes, but he wrote out a statement that the Woman’s Party\r\ncould understand as indicating his position. That statement is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    We have talked over the Suffrage situation with Senator Borah and\r\n    our understanding from the interview is that he will carry out his\r\n    platform and vote for the Suffrage Amendment if re-elected.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Woman’s Party telegraphed this statement to Idaho and asked his\r\nconstituents to get him to confirm it. He was very evasive in replying\r\nto their questions and Alice Paul finally sent him the following letter:\r\n\r\n\r\n                   October 29, 1918. SENATOR WM. E. BORAH,\r\n\r\n         Senate Office Building,\r\n\r\n              Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\n    DEAR SENATOR BORAH:\r\n\r\n    In view of the statement that you have just telegraphed to one of\r\n    our members, Mrs. Marcella Pride, in Boise, and in view of the\r\n    statements which you have made to various newspaper correspondents\r\n    in Washington since Mrs. Baker’s and my interview with you, giving\r\n    them the impression that there was no basis for our understanding\r\n    that you would vote for the Suffrage Amendment after November 5th,\r\n    we feel that we have no course left but to throw all the strength\r\n    which we possess in Idaho against you. I have, therefore,\r\n    telegraphed to this effect today to Miss Whittemore, who is in\r\n    charge of our Idaho work.\r\n\r\n    I am sure I need not tell you how much we regret that you have not\r\n    felt able to say frankly what you would do after election, and that\r\n    you are not willing to stand by the statement which you authorized\r\n    us to give out as expressing the understanding to be derived by us\r\n    from our interview with you.\r\n\r\n              Sincerely yours,\r\n\r\n                   ALICE PAUL, National Chairman.\r\n\r\n\r\nThereupon the Woman’s Party campaigned against him until election. Borah\r\nwas re-elected. Here—anticipating by three months—it must be mentioned\r\nthat when on February 10, the Amendment came to a vote, Borah voted,\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   X\r\n\r\n      THE PRESIDENT INCLUDES SUFFRAGE IN HIS CAMPAIGN FOR CONGRESS\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR the third time the Woman’s Party had waged in the West one of its\r\nmarvelous campaigns against the Democratic Party. The repercussion of\r\nthat campaign had reached the President. When Congress convened in\r\nDecember, he included the Federal Amendment in his message of December 2\r\nto Congress as a part of the Administration program. He said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    And what shall we say of the women—of their instant intelligence,\r\n    quickening every task that they touched; their capacity for\r\n    organization and co-operation, which gave their action discipline\r\n    and enhanced the effectiveness of everything they attempted; their\r\n    aptitude at tasks to which they had never before set their hands;\r\n    their utter self-sacrifice alike in what they did and what they\r\n    gave? Their contribution to the great result is beyond appraisal.\r\n    They have added a new luster to the annals of American womanhood.\r\n\r\n    The least tribute we can pay them is to make them the equals of men\r\n    in political rights as they have proved themselves their equals in\r\n    every field of practical work they have entered, whether for\r\n    themselves or for their country. These great days of completed\r\n    achievement would be sadly marred were we to omit that act of\r\n    justice. Besides the immense practical services they have rendered,\r\n    the women of the country have been the moving spirits in the\r\n    systematic economies by which our people have voluntarily assisted\r\n    to supply the suffering peoples of the world and the armies upon\r\n    every front with food and everything else that we had that might\r\n    serve the common cause. The details of such a story can never be\r\n    fully written, but we carry them at our hearts and thank God that we\r\n    can say that we are the kinsmen of such.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was the first time that any President ever mentioned Suffrage as a\r\npart of his administrative program. It was a step forward. The women\r\nwaited ten days to see whether he would follow this message with action.\r\n\r\nThe President sailed for France.\r\n\r\nWhen the Woman’s Party discovered from the Administration leaders that\r\nhe had left no orders to have Suffrage carried out, they decided to hold\r\nanother protest meeting.\r\n\r\n“In carrying on a campaign for Democracy abroad and utterly ignoring it\r\nat home,” Alice Paul said, “he has exposed his whole broadside to our\r\nattack.”\r\n\r\nAs always, whenever possible, the Woman’s Party announced their protest\r\nmeeting through the newspapers. Lucy Branham went to Police\r\nHeadquarters. She explained her errand, asking for a permit.\r\n\r\n“Here’s your permit!” Colonel Ridley said.\r\n\r\nLucy Branham made further explanation, “We are going to burn the\r\nPresident’s words,” she warned him.\r\n\r\n“Here’s your permit!” Colonel Ridley said.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   XI\r\n\r\n                  BURNING THE PRESIDENT’S WORDS AGAIN\r\n\r\n\r\nON December 16, a woman carrying an American flag, emerged from\r\nHeadquarters. Behind her came a long line of women bearing purple,\r\nwhite, and gold banners. Behind them came fifty women bearing lighted\r\ntorches. Behind them came women—more women and more women and more\r\nwomen. Always a banner’s length apart they marched and on they came ...\r\nand on ... and on ... and on.... People who saw the demonstrations say\r\nthat it seemed as though the colorful, slow-moving line would never come\r\nto an end. Witnesses say also that it was the most beautiful of all the\r\nWoman’s Party demonstrations. They marched to the Lafayette Monument.\r\nTheir leader, Mrs. Harvey Wiley, stopped in front of a burning cauldron\r\nwhich had been placed at the foot of the pedestal. The torch bearers\r\nformed a semi-circle about that cauldron. The women with the purple,\r\nwhite, and gold banners—who were the speakers—grouped themselves around\r\nthe torch bearers.\r\n\r\nAmong these women were the State Chairman or a Woman’s Party\r\nrepresentative from almost all the forty-eight States; some of whom had\r\ncome great distances to be present on this occasion. There were three\r\nhundred in all.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, a huge crowd, which augmented steadily in numbers and\r\nin excitement as the long line of Suffragists came on and on and on,\r\nformed a great, black, attentive mass, which hedged in the banner\r\nbearers, as the banner bearers hedged in the torch bearers. In that\r\ncrowd were the National Democratic Chairman and many prominent\r\nDemocratic politicians.\r\n\r\nDusk changed into darkness, and the flames from cauldron and torches\r\nmounted higher and higher.\r\n\r\nAfter the Suffragists had assembled, there came a moment of quiet. Then\r\nVida Milholland stepped forward and without accompaniment of any kind,\r\nsang with her characteristic spirit the _Woman’s Marseillaise_.\r\nImmediately afterwards, Mrs. John Rogers opened the meeting, and\r\nintroduced, one after another, nineteen speakers, each of whom, first\r\nreading them, dropped some words of President Wilson’s on democracy into\r\nthe flaming cauldron.\r\n\r\nMrs. John Rogers declared:\r\n\r\n\r\n    We hold this meeting to protest against the denial of liberty to\r\n    American women. All over the world today we see surging and sweeping\r\n    irresistibly on, the great tide of democracy, and women would be\r\n    derelict to their duty if they did not see to it that it brings\r\n    freedom to the women of this land.\r\n\r\n    England has enfranchised her women, Canada has enfranchised her\r\n    women, Russia has enfranchised her women, the liberated nations of\r\n    Central Europe are enfranchising their women. America must live up\r\n    to her pretensions of democracy!\r\n\r\n    Our ceremony today is planned to call attention to the fact that the\r\n    President has gone abroad to establish democracy in foreign lands\r\n    when he has failed to establish democracy at home. We burn his words\r\n    on liberty today, not in malice or anger, but in a spirit of\r\n    reverence for truth.\r\n\r\n    This meeting is a message to President Wilson. We expect an answer.\r\n    If it is more words, we will burn them again. The only answer the\r\n    National Woman’s Party will accept is the instant passage of the\r\n    Amendment in the Senate.\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. M. Toscan Bennett was the first speaker. She said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    It is because we are moved by a passion for democracy that we are\r\n    here to protest against the President’s forsaking the cause of\r\n    freedom in America and appearing as a champion of freedom in the old\r\n    world. We burn with shame and indignation that President Wilson\r\n    should appear before the representatives of nations who have\r\n    enfranchised their women, as chief spokesman for the right of\r\n    self-government while American women are denied that right. We are\r\n    held up to ridicule to the whole world.\r\n\r\n    We consign to the flames the words of the President which have\r\n    inspired women of other nations to strive for their freedom while\r\n    their author refuses to do what lies in his power to do to liberate\r\n    the women of his own country. Meekly to submit to this dishonor to\r\n    the nation would be treason to mankind.\r\n\r\n    Mr. President, the paper currency of liberty which you hand to women\r\n    is worthless fuel until it is backed by the gold of action.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Reverend Olympia Brown of Wisconsin, eighty-four years old, burned\r\nthe latest words of President Wilson, his two speeches made on the first\r\nday of his visit to France. She said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    America has fought for France and the common cause of liberty. I\r\n    have fought for liberty for seventy years and I protest against the\r\n    President leaving our country with this old fight here unwon.\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. John Winters Brannan burned the address made by President Wilson at\r\nthe Metropolitan Opera House in opening the Fourth Liberty Loan\r\nCampaign, in which he justified women’s protest when he said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    We have been told it is unpatriotic to criticise public action. If\r\n    it is, there is a deep disgrace resting upon the origin of this\r\n    nation. We have forgotten the history of our country if we have\r\n    forgotten how to object, how to resist, how to agitate when it is\r\n    necessary to readjust matters.\r\n\r\n\r\nMary Ingham burned President Wilson’s speech of the Fourth of July,\r\n1914, in which he said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    There is nothing in liberty unless it is translated into definite\r\n    action in our own lives today.\r\n\r\n\r\nMiss Ingham said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    In the name of the women of Pennsylvania who are demanding action of\r\n    the President, I consign these words to the flames.\r\n\r\n\r\nAgnes Morey burned President Wilson’s book, _The New Freedom_. She said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    On today, the anniversary of the Boston Tea Party, in the name of\r\n    the liberty-loving women of Massachusetts, I consign these words to\r\n    the flames in protest against the exclusion of women from the\r\n    Democratic program of this Administration.\r\n\r\n\r\nHenrietta Briggs Wall burned President Wilson’s address given at\r\nIndependence Hall, July 4, 1919, when he said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Liberty does not consist in mere general declarations of the rights\r\n    of man. It consists in the translation of these declarations into\r\n    action.\r\n\r\n\r\nSusan Frost, of South Carolina, burned President Wilson’s last message\r\nto Congress in which he again spoke words without results.\r\n\r\nMrs. Townsend Scott burned his message to the Socialists in France which\r\ndeclared:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The enemies of liberty from this time forth must be shut out.\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Eugene Shippen burned this message to Congress:\r\n\r\n\r\n    This is a war for self-government among all the peoples of the world\r\n    as against the arbitrary choices of self-constituted masters.\r\n\r\n\r\nSara Grogan burned another message to Congress dealing with liberty for\r\nother nations.\r\n\r\nClara Wold burned the message to Congress demanding self-government for\r\nFilipinos.\r\n\r\nJessie Adler burned the speech to the Chamber of Commerce of Columbus:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I believe that democracy is the only thing that vitalizes the whole\r\n    people.\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Percy Reed burned this message to Congress:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Liberty is a fierce and intractable thing to which no bounds can be\r\n    set and no bounds ought to be set.\r\n\r\n\r\nSue White burned the President’s reply to President Poincaré of France.\r\n\r\nMary Sutherland burned the words:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I believe the might of America is the sincere love of its people for\r\n    the freedom of mankind.\r\n\r\n\r\nEdith Phelps burned the Flag Day address.\r\n\r\nDoris Stevens burned a statement to Democratic women before election:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I have done everything I could do and shall continue to do\r\n    everything in my power for the Federal Suffrage Amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Caroline Spencer burned the words which President Wilson said when\r\nhe laid a wreath on the tomb of Lafayette, “in memory of the great\r\nLafayette—from a fellow servant of liberty.”\r\n\r\nMargaret Oakes burned the Suffrage message to the Senate:\r\n\r\n\r\n    We shall deserve to be distrusted if we do not enfranchise our\r\n    women.\r\n\r\n\r\nFlorence Bayard Hilles ended the meeting with a declaration that women\r\nwould continue their struggle for freedom, and would burn the words of\r\nPresident Wilson even as he spoke them until he and his Party made these\r\nwords good by granting political freedom to the women of America.\r\n\r\nAfter the meeting was over, the long line marched back to Headquarters.\r\nA big, applauding crowd walked along with them.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XII\r\n\r\n                       THE WATCHFIRES OF FREEDOM\r\n\r\n\r\nALICE PAUL spent all day Christmas of 1918 in bed resting. At least, she\r\nwas resting physically. Mentally....\r\n\r\nOn that day she evolved a new plan of bringing the attention of the\r\nPresident, the attention of the country, the attention of the world, to\r\nthe fact that the Susan B. Anthony Amendment must be passed. It was\r\nimpossible—because of the action of the police in putting out the fires\r\nand arresting those who tended them—to carry out, in all its detail, her\r\noriginal plan which was extraordinarily striking and picturesque.\r\nPerhaps at no time in the history of the world has there ever been\r\nprojected a demonstration so full of a beautiful symbolism.\r\n\r\nThe original plan was to keep a fire burning on the pavement in front of\r\nthe White House till the Susan B. Anthony Amendment was passed. Wood for\r\nthis bonfire was to be sent from all the States. Whenever the President\r\nmade a speech in Europe for democracy, that speech was to be burned in\r\nthe watchfire. While this was going on a bell, which was set above the\r\ndoor of Headquarters, would toll.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of New Year’s Day, 1919, therefore, a wagon drove up to\r\nthe White House pavement and deposited an urn filled with firewood—on a\r\nspot in line with the White House door. Presently the bell at\r\nHeadquarters began to toll, and a group of women marched from\r\nHeadquarters to the urn. Edith Ainge lighted the fire, and Mrs. Lawrence\r\nLewis dropped into the flames the most recent words, in regard to\r\ndemocracy, that President Wilson had addressed to the people of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe first was from the Manchester speech:\r\n\r\n\r\n    We will enter into no combinations of power which are not\r\n    combinations of all of us.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second was from his toast in Buckingham Palace:\r\n\r\n\r\n    We have used great words, all of us. We have used the words “right”\r\n    and “justice,” and now we are to prove whether or not we understand\r\n    these words.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe third was from his speech at Brest:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Public opinion strongly sustains all proposals for co-operation of\r\n    self-governing peoples.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fourth was from the speech to the English wounded:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I want to tell you how much I honor you men who have been wounded\r\n    fighting for freedom.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Mrs. Lewis burned these “scraps of paper,” Mary Dubrow and Annie\r\nArniel, standing behind the urn, unfurled a lettered banner:\r\n\r\n            PRESIDENT WILSON IS DECEIVING THE WORLD WHEN HE\r\n                  APPEARS AS THE PROPHET OF DEMOCRACY.\r\n\r\n             PRESIDENT WILSON HAS OPPOSED THOSE WHO DEMAND\r\n                      DEMOCRACY FOR THIS COUNTRY.\r\n\r\n             HE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DISFRANCHISEMENT OF\r\n                         MILLIONS OF AMERICANS.\r\n\r\n                        WE IN AMERICA KNOW THIS.\r\n\r\n                      THE WORLD WILL FIND HIM OUT.\r\n\r\nThis was the first of the many Watchfires of Freedom kindled by the\r\nWoman’s Party.\r\n\r\nAfter these words were burned, Mrs. Lewis addressed the crowd that had\r\ngathered. When Helena Hill Weed, who had followed her, was speaking, a\r\ngroup of soldiers and sailors rushed forward, overturned the urn, and\r\nbegan to stamp out the blazing pieces of wood. There were two sentinels\r\non each side of the urn, Gertrude Crocker, Harriet U. Andrews, Mrs. A.\r\nP. Winston, Julia Emory. They bore the tri-color, but they also bore\r\ntorches. They quickly lighted the torches from the embers, and held them\r\naloft. The rioting continued, but Mrs. Weed went calmly on with her\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\nSuddenly there was an exclamation from the crowd. Everybody turned.\r\nFlames were issuing from the huge, bronze urn in Lafayette Square\r\ndirectly opposite the bonfire.\r\n\r\nHazel Hunkins—clinging to the high-pedestaled urn—was holding aloft the\r\nSuffrage tri-color. The flames played over the slender Tanagra-like\r\nfigure of the girl and glowed through the purple, white, and gold.\r\nPeople said it was—that instant’s picture—like a glimpse from the\r\n_Götterdämmerung_. Policemen immediately rushed over there, followed by\r\na large crowd. They arrested Alice Paul, Julia Emory, Hazel Hunkins,\r\nEdith Ainge.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the fire in front of the White House had been rebuilt\r\nand rekindled. It burned all night long and all the next day. Alice\r\nPaul, who had been released with her three companions after being\r\ndetained at the police station for a while, remained on guard until\r\nmorning. Annie Arniel and Julia Emory stayed with her. It rained all\r\nnight. But until late, crowds gathered, quiet and very interested, to\r\nlisten to the speeches. This was Wednesday. All day Thursday succeeding\r\ngroups of women took up their watch on the fire.\r\n\r\nFriday afternoon, the same banner was carried out. As soon as it was\r\nunfurled, a crowd of soldiers, sailors, and small boys, a chief petty\r\nofficer in the navy being most violent, attacked the Suffragists, Mary\r\nDubrow and Matilda Young. They tore the banner, broke the urn and\r\nattacked the purple, white, and gold flags. The fires, were, however, at\r\nonce rekindled. It was still raining, and the rain was mixed with snow,\r\nwhich became a steady sleet. But the fires continued. Finally a force of\r\npolicemen put them out with chemicals. That night they were relighted.\r\nMary Logue and Miss Ross guarded it until two in the morning; Mrs.\r\nLawrence Lewis and Julia Emory from two until seven.\r\n\r\nSaturday afternoon, the bell at Headquarters tolled again. Immediately\r\nthe flames leaped up on the White House pavement. Alice Paul, Mrs.\r\nLawrence Lewis, and Phœbe Munnecke burned the first speech on Liberty\r\nmade by President Wilson on reaching Italy. They were arrested, and the\r\npolice put out the watchfire with chemicals. Instantly the fire started\r\nin the urn. Mary Dubrow and Julia Emory were arrested. All five women\r\nwere released on bail.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, January 5, Julia Emory, Mary Dubrow, Annie Arniel, and Phœbe\r\nMunnecke started a fire in front of the White House. They burned the\r\nsecond speech on Liberty made by the President in Italy. All the time\r\nthe bell pealed its solemn tocsin. The four sentinels were arrested.\r\nThis time they refused to give bail and were sent to the house of\r\ndetention. The fire had now burned all day and all night on Wednesday,\r\nThursday, Friday, and Saturday.\r\n\r\nAll these sentinels were charged, when they were arrested, with breaking\r\na Federal Park regulation. But when they came to court, they were\r\ncharged with building a bonfire on a public highway between sunset and\r\nsunrise. Three of them went to prison for five days, and three for ten\r\ndays. They all went on hunger-strike.\r\n\r\nJanuary 7, evidently the official mind changed. The fire which consumed\r\nthe President’s speech on democracy delivered in Turin was allowed to\r\nburn for three hours. Nevertheless the crowd kept kicking it about, so\r\nthat there was a line of flames across the pavement and trailing into\r\nthe gutter. By hook or by crook—three of the Suffragists—Harriet\r\nAndrews, Mrs. A. P. Winston, Mrs. Edmund C. Evans—managed to keep it\r\ngoing.\r\n\r\nAt the end of three hours, new orders seemed to materialize out of the\r\nair; for then the police took a hand and put the fire out. With the\r\nextinction of the last ember, however, a second fire burst into flames\r\nat the base of the Lafayette Monument across the street. The police\r\nrushed to it, and put it out. Immediately another fire started at the\r\nopposite corner of the Park. And then fires became general ... here ...\r\nthere ... everywhere....\r\n\r\nThe police arrested the three women who had kept the fire going. On the\r\nfollowing day they were sentenced to five days in jail.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of that day, Mrs. M. Toscan Bennett and Matilda Young\r\nburned the speech that the President had just made at the statue of\r\nColumbus in Genoa. They were arrested at once, and they too were given\r\nfive days in jail.\r\n\r\nBy this time, there were eleven women in jail, all on a hunger-strike.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of January 13, just as the thousands of government\r\nclerks began to pour down Pennsylvania Avenue past the White House,\r\ntwenty-five Suffragists, each one bearing a banner of purple, white, and\r\ngold, came round the corner of Lafayette Square. They proceeded to the\r\nWhite House pavement, where they built a watchfire. The crowds, of\r\ncourse, stopped to watch the proceedings. Policemen finally broke\r\nthrough them and arrested three of the women. The other twenty-two\r\nclosed in their line a little, and went on with their fire-building. The\r\npolice returned, but they did not arrest the others. But they tried to\r\nbreak up the fire with huge shovels and a fire extinguisher. They tried\r\nto trample it out. But it was useless. Wherever a bit of the watchfire\r\nfell, it broke into flames. Finally, they arrested seventeen more women.\r\nFour remained, holding the purple, white, and gold banners.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a great tongue of flame leaped upwards from the urn in\r\nLafayette Square. The crowd rushed towards it. Then for a moment it\r\nseemed to go mad. A group of young men rushed over to the Headquarters;\r\nclimbed up the pillars; tore down the flag, the uprights, and the pole.\r\nThe bell ultimately crashed to the ground.\r\n\r\nThe police arrested the remaining four sentinels. By eight o’clock that\r\nafternoon, released on bail, all the women were back in Headquarters.\r\nHalf an hour later, they went out with their banners again. The streets\r\nseemed deserted even by policemen. But, as they crossed the street, the\r\npark police began to materialize from the shrubs and trees of the\r\nsquare. However, they built their watchfire on the White House pavement,\r\nand stood there on guard for an hour and a half. Crowds gathered, of\r\ncourse. Occasionally, a man would rush over to one of the girls, and\r\ntear her banner from her. The girl would hold it as long as it was a\r\nphysical possibility, the crowd meanwhile calling remonstrance or\r\nencouragement according to their sympathies. By ten o’clock the women\r\nwere all arrested again. They spent the night in the house of detention.\r\nThey were: Dr. Caroline Spencer; Adelina Piunti; Helen Chisaski; Mrs. C.\r\nWeaver; Eva Weaver; Ruth Scott; Elsie Ver Vane; Julia Emory; Lucia\r\nCalmes; Mrs. Alexander Shields; Elizabeth Kalb; Mildred Morris; Lucy\r\nBurns; Edith Ainge; Mrs. Gilson Gardner; Gertrude Crocker; Ellen Winsor;\r\nKate Heffelfinger; Katherine Boyle; Naomi Barrett; Palys L. Chevrier;\r\nMaud Jamison; Elizabeth Huff.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSuffragists filled the court when these women came up for trial. Four of\r\nthem were tried at once. They were sentenced to a ten-dollar fine or\r\nfive days’ imprisonment. Their entrance into court had been greeted with\r\napplause from the audience. When the next four women appeared, they too\r\nwere applauded. The Judge said, “The bailiffs will escort the prisoners\r\nout and bring them in again, and if there is any applause this time....”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ONE OF THE WATCHFIRES OF FREEDOM. Taken Just Before the\r\nArrest of the Picket Line.\r\nPhoto Copr. Harris and Ewing, Washington, D. C.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A POLICEMAN SCATTERS THE WATCHFIRE.\r\nPhoto Copr. Harris and Ewing, Washington, D. C.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe prisoners returned, and the applause was a roar. Three women among\r\nthose who applauded were taken out of the mass. “The police will escort\r\nthe women out of the courtroom,” said the Court. When they reached the\r\ndoor, “And see that they do not return,” added the Court. As the door\r\nclosed, “And lock the doors,” shouted the Court. Thereafter, the\r\nprisoners were brought in one at a time, and were sent to jail\r\nimmediately. Twenty-two women were thus sentenced. There remained one\r\nfor whom there was no prosecuting witness—Naomi Barrett.\r\n\r\nThe next day, Naomi Barrett was tried alone. As she came forward,\r\napplause greeted her—applause long and continued. The Judge ordered\r\nsilence. The applause continued. He ordered the applauders to be brought\r\nforward. One, Mrs. Pflaster, sank to the floor in a faint. She was\r\npicked up and put on a chair, but as she fell from the chair, the Judge\r\nordered her removed at once. A physician was sent for. Her fellow\r\nSuffragists demanded that they be permitted to see her. Finally one of\r\nthem was allowed to go to her. The Court had scarcely reached the next\r\ncase when word came that Mrs. Pflaster was in a serious condition. The\r\nSuffragists came rushing in and demanded that the Judge come off the\r\nBench and see what had happened; the Court obeyed. In due time the\r\ndoctor arrived, a stretcher came, and the patient was taken to the\r\nEmergency Hospital.\r\n\r\nThe Judge resumed his seat, and sentenced Bertha Moller, Gertrude\r\nMurphy, Rhoda Kellogg, and Margaret Whittemore—the applauders—to\r\ntwenty-four hours in jail for contempt of court. Mrs. Barrett was\r\nsentenced to five days in jail. They joined the twenty-two women who\r\nwere already there and hunger-striking.\r\n\r\nOn January 27, six women kindled a Watchfire on the White House\r\npavement. They were arrested on the charge of starting a fire after\r\nsundown. They were as usual, tried the next day; sentenced to five days\r\nin jail. They went on a hunger-strike of course. They were: Bertha\r\nMoller; Gertrude Murphy; Rhoda Kellogg; Mary Carol Dowell; Martha Moore;\r\nKatherine Magee.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime an interesting event took place in France. President\r\nWilson received a delegation representing the working women of France,\r\nSaturday, January 25, at the Murat Mansion in Paris. The delegation\r\nurged upon the President that the Peace Conference include Woman\r\nSuffrage among the points to be settled by the Conference. President\r\nWilson replied as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Mlle. Thomson and ladies: You have not only done me a great honor,\r\n    but you have touched me very much by this unexpected tribute; and\r\n    may I add that you have frightened me, because realizing the great\r\n    confidence you place in me, I am led to the question of my own\r\n    ability to justify that confidence?\r\n\r\n    You have not placed your confidence wrongly in my hopes and\r\n    purposes, but perhaps not all of those hopes and purposes can be\r\n    realized in the great matter that you have so much at heart—the\r\n    right of women to take their full share in the political life of the\r\n    nations to which they belong. That is necessarily a domestic\r\n    question for the several nations. A conference of peace settling the\r\n    relations of nations with each other would be regarded as going very\r\n    much outside its province if it undertook to dictate to the several\r\n    states what their internal policy should be.\r\n\r\n    At the same time these considerations apply also to the conditions\r\n    of labor; and it does not seem to be unlikely that the conference\r\n    will take some action by way of expressing its sentiments, at any\r\n    rate, with regard to the international aspects at least of labor,\r\n    and I should hope that some occasion might be offered for the case\r\n    not only of the women of France, but of their sisters all over the\r\n    world, to be presented to the consideration of the conference.\r\n\r\n    The conference is turning out to be a rather unwieldy body, a very\r\n    large body representing a great many nations, large and small, old\r\n    and new; and the method of organizing its work successfully, I am\r\n    afraid will have to be worked out stage by stage. Therefore I have\r\n    no confident prediction to make as to the way in which it can take\r\n    up the question of this sort.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SUFFRAGIST REBUILDING THE FIRE SCATTERED BY THE POLICE.\r\nPhoto Copr. Harris and Ewing, Washington, D. C.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LAST SUFFRAGIST ARRESTED—THE FIRE BURNS ON.\r\nPhoto Copr. Harris and Ewing, Washington, D. C.]\r\n\r\n\r\n    But what I have most at heart today is to avail myself of this\r\n    opportunity to express my admiration for the women of all the\r\n    nations that have been engaged in the war. By the fortunes of this\r\n    war the chief burden has fallen upon the women of France, and they\r\n    have borne it with a spirit and a devotion which has commanded the\r\n    admiration of the world.\r\n\r\n    I do not think that the people of France fully realize, perhaps, the\r\n    intensity of the sympathy that other nations have felt for them.\r\n    They think of us in America, for example, as a long way off. And we\r\n    are in space but we are not in thought. You must remember that the\r\n    United States is made up of the nations of Europe: that French\r\n    sympathies run straight across the seas, not merely by historic\r\n    association but by blood connection, and that these nerves of\r\n    sympathy are quick to transmit the impulses of one nation to the\r\n    other.\r\n\r\n    We have followed your sufferings with a feeling that we were\r\n    witnessing one of the most heroic, and may I add, at the same time\r\n    satisfactory things in the world, satisfactory because it showed the\r\n    strength of the human spirit, the indomitable power of women and men\r\n    alike to sustain any burden if the cause was great enough.\r\n\r\n    In an ordinary war there might have been some shrinking, some\r\n    sinking of effort; but this was not an ordinary war. This was a war\r\n    not only to redeem France from an enemy, but to redeem the world\r\n    from an enemy. And France, therefore, and the women of France\r\n    strained their hearts to sustain the world. I hope that the strain\r\n    has not been in vain. I know that it has not been in vain.\r\n\r\n    This war has been popular and unlike other wars in that it seemed\r\n    sometimes as if the chief strain was behind the lines and not at the\r\n    lines. It took so many men to conduct the war that the older men and\r\n    the women at home had to carry the nation. Not only so, but the\r\n    industries of the nation were almost as much a part of the fighting\r\n    as the things that took place at the fronts.\r\n\r\n    So it is for that reason that I have said to those with whom I am at\r\n    present associated that this must be a people’s peace, because this\r\n    was a people’s war. The people won this war, not the governments,\r\n    and the people must reap the benefits of the war. At every turn we\r\n    must see to it that it is not an adjustment between governments\r\n    merely, but an agreement for the peace and security of men and women\r\n    everywhere.\r\n\r\n    The little obscure sufferings and the daily unknown privations, the\r\n    unspoken sufferings of the heart, are the tragical things of this\r\n    war. They have been borne at home, and the center of the home is the\r\n    woman. My heart goes out to you, therefore, ladies, in a very\r\n    unusual degree, and I welcome this opportunity to bring you this\r\n    message, not from myself merely, but from the great people whom I\r\n    represent.\r\n\r\n\r\nMary Nolan—over seventy years old—immediately made Suffrage capital of\r\nthis speech by the President. Mrs. Nolan’s record in the period of the\r\nWatchfires is positively heroic.\r\n\r\nOn January 19, with Bertha Arnold, Mrs. Nolan was arrested for the first\r\ntime in connection with the Watchfires of Freedom demonstrations. On\r\nJanuary 24, while under suspended sentence, the two women again fed the\r\nflames in front of the White House. They were immediately arrested; the\r\nnext day, tried. Mrs. Nolan said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I am guilty if there is any guilt in a demand for freedom. I protest\r\n    against the action of the President who is depriving American women\r\n    of freedom. I have been sent to represent my State Florida, and I am\r\n    willing to do or suffer anything to bring victory to the long\r\n    courageous struggle. I have fought this fight many years. I have\r\n    seen children born to grow to womanhood to fight at my side. I have\r\n    seen their children grow up to fight with us.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo great a storm of applause greeted these remarks that the Judge had\r\nthirteen of the applauders brought immediately to the dock and tried for\r\ncontempt of Court. Thirteen women were sentenced to forty-eight hours in\r\njail with no alternative of fines. These thirteen women were: Lucy\r\nBurns; Edith Ainge; Mary Gertrude Fendall; Phœbe Munnecke; Lucy Branham;\r\nAnnie Arniel; Matilda Young; Ruth Crocker; Elsie Unterman; Kate Boeckh;\r\nEmily Huff; Lucile Shields; Elizabeth Walmsley.\r\n\r\nBertha Arnold received a sentence of five days, but Mrs. Nolan was\r\nreleased.\r\n\r\nOn Monday, January 27, Mrs. Nolan went out on the picket line again,\r\nthis time with Sarah Colvin. As she burned in the Watchfire the text of\r\nthe President’s words to the French workingwomen, she said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    President Wilson told the women of France that they had not placed\r\n    their confidences wrongly in his hopes and purposes. I tell the\r\n    women of France that the women of America have placed their\r\n    confidence in President Wilson’s hopes and purposes for six years,\r\n    and the Party of which he is a leader has continually, and is even\r\n    now obstructing their enfranchisement.\r\n\r\n    President Wilson has the power to do for the women of this nation\r\n    what he asserts he would like to do for the women of other nations.\r\n\r\n    There are thirty-one days left for the passage of the Suffrage\r\n    Amendment in this Congress, of which his Party is in control. Let\r\n    him return to this country and act to secure democracy for his own\r\n    people. Then the words that he spoke for the women of Europe will\r\n    have weight and will bear fruit. Sooner or later the women of the\r\n    world will know what we know—that confidence cannot be placed in\r\n    President Wilson’s hopes and purposes for the freedom of women.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe police seemed loath to arrest Mrs. Nolan, but they finally did so.\r\nThe Court as reluctantly sentenced her to twenty-four hours in jail.\r\nMrs. Colvin received the customary five days. Three more applauding\r\nSuffragists were committed at this last trial, for forty-eight hours:\r\nCora Crawford, Margaret Rossett, Elsie Unterman.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn January 31, Mrs. Nolan was again arrested at a Watchfire\r\ndemonstration with Mary Ingham and Annie Arniel. She was discharged by\r\nthe Court. Mary Ingham and Annie Arniel, it may be mentioned, were held\r\nin jail for two days before they were brought to trial. There were no\r\nwitnesses against them, and so they were freed.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn February 4, Mrs. Nolan was arrested again with Elsie T. Russian and\r\nBertha Wallerstein for burning the President’s speech to French\r\nDeputies. There was the usual applause when the three women appeared in\r\nCourt, and, as usual, the Judge ordered silence; as usual, the applause\r\ncontinued. Three applauders were thrown out.\r\n\r\nMrs. Russian made the following statement to the Court:\r\n\r\n\r\n    By burning the hypocritical words of President Wilson, we have\r\n    expressed the unmistakable impatience of American women. In place of\r\n    words, these women demand action. I am glad to have taken part in\r\n    the expression of that demand.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe watchfires had been going since New Year’s Day, growing in numbers\r\nuntil they culminated in the biggest demonstration of all, two days\r\nbefore the day set for the vote.\r\n\r\nOn February 9, they burned the President in effigy.\r\n\r\nAt half-past four that Sunday, the bell at Headquarters began to toll. A\r\nprocession of a hundred women, headed by Mrs. H. O. Havemeyer bearing\r\nthe American flag, marched to the White House pavement. Behind Mrs.\r\nHavemeyer came Ella Riegel, bearing the purple, white, and gold banner.\r\nBehind the color bearers came Mrs. John Rogers and Mary Ingham, carrying\r\na lettered banner which said:\r\n\r\n               ONLY FIFTEEN LEGISLATIVE DAYS ARE LEFT FOR\r\n                             THIS CONGRESS.\r\n\r\n             FOR MORE THAN A YEAR THE PRESIDENT’S PARTY HAS\r\n                    BLOCKED SUFFRAGE IN THE SENATE.\r\n\r\n                        IT IS BLOCKING IT TODAY.\r\n\r\n             THE PRESIDENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE BETRAYAL\r\n                         OF AMERICAN WOMANHOOD.\r\n\r\nBehind this came Sarah T. Colvin and Mrs. Walter Adams, carrying a\r\nsecond lettered banner:\r\n\r\n            WHY DOES NOT THE PRESIDENT ENSURE THE PASSAGE OF\r\n                    SUFFRAGE IN THE SENATE TOMORROW?\r\n\r\n               WHY DOES HE NOT WIN FROM HIS PARTY THE ONE\r\n                              VOTE NEEDED?\r\n\r\n              HAS HE AGREED TO PERMIT SUFFRAGE AGAIN TO BE\r\n                             PUSHED ASIDE?\r\n\r\n          PRESIDENT WILSON IS DECEIVING THE WORLD. HE PREACHES\r\n              DEMOCRACY ABROAD AND THWARTS DEMOCRACY HERE.\r\n\r\nBehind these banners came Nell Mercer and Elizabeth McShane bearing an\r\nearthen urn filled with fire. Behind them came Sue White and Gabrielle\r\nHarris, who were to perform the leading act of the demonstration.\r\n\r\nAfter these came twenty-six wood bearers, and long eddying waves of the\r\npurple, white, and gold. The urn bearers deposited the urn in its place\r\non the pavement opposite the White House door. The wood bearers and the\r\nbanner bearers formed a guard about it. Sue White then advanced and\r\ndropped into the flames a paper figure—a cartoon—of the President. Mrs.\r\nHavemeyer then attempted to make a speech. Before she was arrested, she\r\nmanaged to say the following three sentences:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Every Anglo-Saxon government in the world has enfranchised its\r\n    women. In Russia, in Hungary, in Austria, in Germany itself, the\r\n    women are completely enfranchised, and thirty-four are now sitting\r\n    in the new Reichstag. We women of America are assembled here today\r\n    to voice our deep indignation that while such efforts are being made\r\n    to establish democracy for Europe, American women are still deprived\r\n    of a voice in their government here at home.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeaker after speaker attempted to follow her, but they were all\r\narrested. The police patrols were soon filled up, and nearby cars were\r\ncommandeered. There was an enormous crowd present. The police—nearly a\r\nhundred of them—tried to force them back, and succeeded in getting them\r\npart way across Pennsylvania Avenue. When they turned back, more wood\r\nhad been brought from Headquarters, and another fire started. Other\r\nwomen who came from Headquarters with further reinforcements of wood\r\nwere stopped and arrested. The police then declared the open space\r\nbetween the encircling crowd and the banner-bearing women a military\r\nzone. No person was allowed to enter it. For an hour, therefore, the\r\nwomen stood there. For the most part, they were motionless, but at\r\nintervals they marched slowly round their small segment of sidewalk. The\r\ncrowd stayed until the banner bearers started homeward. They followed\r\nthem to the very entrance of Suffrage Headquarters.\r\n\r\nAll this time the bell was tolling.\r\n\r\nThose arrested were: Mrs. T. W. Forbes, Mary Nolan, Sue White, Mrs. L.\r\nV. G. Gwynne Branham, Lillian Ascough, Jennie Bronenberg, Rose\r\nFishstein, Nell Mercer, Amy Juengling, Reba Comborrov, Mildred Morris,\r\nClara Wold, Louise Bryant, Bertha Wallerstein, Martha Shoemaker, Rebecca\r\nGarrison, Pauline Adams, Marie Ernst Kennedy, Willie Grace Johnson,\r\nPhœbe Munnecke, Mrs. H. O. Havemeyer, Edith Ainge, Lucy Daniels, Mary\r\nIngham, Elizabeth McShane, Sarah T. Colvin, Ella Riegel, Mrs. William\r\nUpton Watson, Anne Herkner, Palys Chevrier, Anna Ginsberg, Estella\r\nEylward, Annie Arniel, Cora Weeks, Lucy Burns, Helena Hill Weed, Mrs.\r\nJohn Rogers, Gladys Greiner, Rose G. Fishstein.\r\n\r\nOn February 10, the Anthony Amendment came up once more for the vote in\r\nthe Senate of the United States. Perhaps at this juncture recapitulation\r\nin regard to the Senate situation will be illuminating.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that when the Amendment passed the House on\r\nJanuary 10, 1918, the Suffragists were eleven votes short in the Senate,\r\nand how—Maud Younger told the story most vivaciously—nine of these votes\r\nwere obtained. For a long time, the Suffragists continued to lack the\r\nremaining two votes. The first thing that promised to ameliorate this\r\ndeadlock was the nomination in the South Carolina primaries of Pollock\r\nfor the short term of the Sixty-fifth Congress, convening December 2,\r\n1918. Senator Pollock confused the situation extraordinarily for the\r\nSuffragists. The South Carolina branch of the Woman’s Party interviewed\r\nhim immediately after his election and it was their understanding that\r\nhe told them that he would vote “yes” on the Amendment. When he came to\r\nWashington, however, he refused to state how he would vote. The\r\nSuffragists were in a difficult situation. Many of them believed that he\r\nintended to vote for the Amendment but he would not say that he did.\r\nThey believed they had one of the two necessary votes but they could\r\nnever be sure of it. All the time, therefore, they were trying to get\r\nthe votes of Moses of New Hampshire, Gay of Louisiana, Hale of Maine,\r\nTrammell of Florida, and Borah of Idaho, as they seemed the most likely\r\nof the opposed or non-committal men.\r\n\r\nIndeed, two kinds of campaigns were going on—one in the States among the\r\nconstituents of these possible men and the campaign of the Watchfires in\r\nWashington. As soon as the Watchfires began, the President again began\r\nto work. He called various Senators asking them to support the\r\nAmendment. The Democratic leaders became alarmed at the effect on the\r\ncountry of this constant turmoil in front of the White House. In fact\r\nthey did the thing they had always steadfastly refused to do—called a\r\ncaucus to mobilize the Democrats back of the Suffrage Amendment. At this\r\ncaucus, various Administration leaders appealed to the Party members in\r\nthe Senate to give their support to the measure. Pollock then made his\r\nfirst public declaration that he would vote for the Suffrage Amendment.\r\n\r\nThe Amendment now needed but one vote.\r\n\r\nThe chairman of the Suffrage Committee then announced that another\r\neffort would be made to pass the measure and it would be brought up for\r\na vote on February 10, although until the Watchfires started, they had\r\nrepeatedly declared that it would be impossible to bring it up twice in\r\nthe same session.\r\n\r\nAs Congress was coming to an end, it was decided to take the vote\r\nanyway, although, as things stood, even with Pollock, the Suffragists\r\nlacked one vote. Pollock did vote for Suffrage but the other vote was\r\nnot forthcoming. The Amendment was therefore defeated on February 10.\r\n\r\nFrom February 10 to June 4, the Woman’s Party was working to get that\r\none vote.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhile the Senate was debating Suffrage, thirty-nine of the women who had\r\nburned the President in effigy the day before were being tried.\r\nTwenty-five sentences of five days and one of two days were pronounced.\r\nThen the Judge demanded, “How many more women are there out there?” When\r\nhe found that several were still waiting, he dismissed them without\r\ntrial.\r\n\r\nThey were not charged with burning the effigy of the President, but with\r\nunlawfully setting fire to certain combustibles in that part of the\r\nDistrict of Columbia known as the White House grounds.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe prison conditions which these Suffragists endured were as unpleasant\r\nas before. At first they went to the District of Columbia jail. Since\r\nprevious incarcerations and the resulting complaints and investigations,\r\nsoap and water had been used to some extent in this jail. So much,\r\nindeed, had soap and water been used that the prisoners could now\r\nclearly distinguish the vermin of more than one species creeping up and\r\ndown the walls. The rats ran about in hordes. While conditions were\r\nsomewhat improved, they were still bad.\r\n\r\nHarriet Andrews, writing of her impressions of the jail in the\r\n_Suffragist_ of January 25, says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The jail was real. And it was not funny. I had a book of poetry to\r\n    read, but I was sorry I hadn’t taken a volume from the works of the\r\n    late Henri Fabre. It would have been interesting to study the habits\r\n    of cockroaches. I lay on my straw pallet and watched them clustered\r\n    in the upper right hand corner of my cell waiting for my light to be\r\n    put out before they began their nightly invasion. And when my light\r\n    went out, the bulb that still burned in the corridor enabled me to\r\n    watch them crawling down in a long, uninterrupted line.... There\r\n    were also other things that crawled.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last group were sent to the old Workhouse in which Suffragists had\r\nbeen imprisoned the August before.\r\n\r\nOf that Helena Hill Weed says in the _Suffragist_ of February 22:\r\n\r\n\r\n    No fire had been built in the old Workhouse this winter until a few\r\n    hours before we were imprisoned there. The dampness and cold of the\r\n    first floor was quite unbearable. They permitted the women to sleep\r\n    in the upper tier of cells, where the ventilation is better than on\r\n    the ground floor where we were forced to sleep last summer. But\r\n    these cells are too dark to stay in during the day, and the only\r\n    other place is the cold, damp stone floor on the ground. The only\r\n    fresh air in the prison enters the building through windows fifteen\r\n    feet above the level of the floor where the women have to spend\r\n    their waking hours. The warm air from the furnaces, which enters the\r\n    building on the first floor immediately rises to the roof. The damp,\r\n    icy winter air and all the noxious gases and foul odors sink to the\r\n    floor, where the women have to sit. They are serving their\r\n    imprisonment under practically cellar conditions. The authorities\r\n    are not forcing us to drink the water in the pipes of the Workhouse\r\n    this time, but are supplying fresh water.\r\n\r\n\r\nHarriet Andrews said that in coming out, “the sense of air and light and\r\nspace burst upon me like a shout.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the Woman’s Party, carrying out its extraordinary\r\nthorough and forthright policy of publicity, had not failed to tell the\r\ncountry at large about all this. They sent throughout the United States\r\na carfull of speakers; all women who had served sentences in prison.\r\nThey were: Abby Scott Baker, Lucy Burns, Bertha Arnold, Mary Ingham,\r\nMabel Vernon, Mrs. Robert Walker, Gladys Greiner, Mrs. A. R. Colvin,\r\nElla Riegel, Mrs. H. O. Havemeyer, Mrs. W. D. Ascough, Mary Winsor,\r\nElizabeth McShane, Vida Milholland, Sue White, Lucy Ewing, Lucy Branham,\r\nEdith Ainge, Pauline Adams, Mrs. John Rogers, Cora Week, and Mary Nolan.\r\n\r\nThis car was called the _Prison Special_ and the newspapers soon called\r\nthe women the _Prison Specialists_. On the platform the speakers all\r\nwore duplicates of their prison costumes. Perhaps in all its history,\r\nthe Woman’s Party has never gathered—not a more brilliant company of\r\nspeakers—but speakers with so marvelous a story to tell. They spoke to\r\npacked houses. At their very first meeting in Charleston, South\r\nCarolina, traffic was actually stopped by the overflow meeting.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XIII\r\n\r\n               THE APPEAL TO THE PRESIDENT ON HIS RETURN\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE President of the United States returned to America from Europe on\r\nFebruary 24, 1919, landing in Boston. Boston arranged an enormous\r\nwelcome-home demonstration. The Woman’s Party determined to take part in\r\nthat welcome to remind him of the Suffrage work to be done, and they\r\nannounced this to the world at large. Alice Paul went to Boston to\r\narrange this demonstration. The Boston police announced in their turn\r\nthat they would establish a dead line in front of the reviewing stand\r\nbeyond which the Suffragists would not be allowed to penetrate. However,\r\nthe Suffragists, following the Red Cross women, marched through the line\r\nof Marines who held the crowd back, and took up their position before\r\nthe reviewing stand where the President was to appear. At the head of\r\nthe line in the place of honor, waving the American flag, was Katherine\r\nMorey. On one side of the Stars and Stripes was the historic banner:\r\n\r\n          MR. PRESIDENT, HOW LONG MUST WOMEN WAIT FOR LIBERTY?\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the Stars and Stripes was a second historic banner:\r\n\r\n          MR. PRESIDENT, WHAT WILL YOU DO FOR WOMAN SUFFRAGE?\r\n\r\nThe special lettered banner for the occasion read:\r\n\r\n          MR. PRESIDENT, YOU SAID IN THE SENATE ON SEPTEMBER 30,\r\n          “WE SHALL NOT ONLY BE DISTRUSTED BUT WE SHALL DESERVE\r\n            TO BE DISTRUSTED IF WE DO NOT ENFRANCHISE WOMEN.”\r\n\r\n\r\n            YOU ALONE CAN REMOVE THIS DISTRUST NOW BY SECURING\r\n            THE ONE VOTE NEEDED TO PASS THE SUFFRAGE AMENDMENT\r\n                             BEFORE MARCH 4.\r\n\r\nThis banner was carried by Lois Shaw and Ruth Small.\r\n\r\nThe police politely requested the pickets to depart and the pickets\r\npolitely refused to go; whereupon the police politely arrested them. The\r\narrested women were: Jessica Henderson, Ruth Small, Lou Daniels, Mrs.\r\nFrank Page, Josephine Collins, Berry Pottier, Wilma Henderson, Mrs.\r\nIrving Gross, Mrs. George Roewer, Francis Fowler, Camilla Whitcomb, Mrs.\r\nH. L. Turner, Eleanor Calnan, Betty Connelly, Betty Gram, Lois Warren\r\nShaw, Rose Lewis, Mrs. E. T. Russian.\r\n\r\nThey were charged with “loitering more than seven minutes.”\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon while the President was making a speech in Mechanics\r\nHall, a Watchfire demonstration occurred on Boston Common. A vast crowd\r\ngathered about it. From three o’clock in the afternoon until six, the\r\nwomen made speeches.\r\n\r\nThe speakers were: Louise Sykes, Mrs. C. C. Jack, Mrs. Mortimer Warren,\r\nMrs. Robert Trent Whitehouse, Agnes H. Morey, Elsie Hill.\r\n\r\nLouise Sykes burned the President’s words—and they were the words that\r\nhe was speaking that very afternoon. Mrs. Mortimer Warren and Mrs. C. C.\r\nJack were arrested at six o’clock and released immediately. Elsie Hill\r\nwas detained on the charge of speaking without a permit.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat day the President’s carriage drove by the Boston Headquarters. When\r\nWilson saw the purple, white, and gold colors, his expression changed.\r\nQuickly he looked the other way. It was observed that he held across his\r\nknees a newspaper whose flaring headlines announced that day’s\r\npicketing.\r\n\r\nThe Suffragists were tried on February 25, by what was very like a Star\r\nChamber proceeding, in the Judge’s lobby on the second floor of the\r\ncourt house. The Press was not excluded from the hearing, but the public\r\nwas. As usual, the Suffragists did not assist the Court by giving names\r\nor answering questions. As a result, in the words of the _Suffragist_,\r\n“There is quite a family of Jane Does in Boston.” Sixteen of\r\nthem—everybody, except Wilma Henderson, who was discovered to be a\r\nminor, and several others who could not be identified—were sentenced to\r\neight days in jail.\r\n\r\nSome person—I quote from the _Suffragist_—entirely unknown and\r\nuntraceable and unidentified, whom the policemen gave the name “E. H.\r\nHowe” paid the fines of these women. Katherine Morey, Ruth Small, and\r\nBetty Connelly were released on February 26; Josephine Collins on\r\nFebruary 27; the others came out two at a time.\r\n\r\nAs usual, the complaints of the Suffragists called the attention of the\r\npeople of the community to the filthy condition of their jail, which\r\nthese experts pronounced one of the worst in the country. It was\r\ncharacterized by the “bucket system.” In each cell stood two buckets for\r\ntoilet purposes. One contained the water in which they bathed. The other\r\nwas emptied once a day or once in two days, according to the frequency\r\nwith which the prisoner was permitted to go into the jail-yard for the\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Boston papers gave this demonstration enormous publicity. Boston\r\ninstitutions received in the press a muckraking which they had not\r\nexperienced in years.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen President Wilson arrived in the Capitol at Washington—after this\r\nwelcome in Boston—one of the first pieces of legislation which he took\r\nup was the Federal Suffrage Amendment. He went to the Capitol and\r\nconferred with Senator Jones of New Mexico (Democrat) Chairman of the\r\nWoman’s Suffrage Committee, about the Suffrage Resolution. After the\r\nvote of February 10, Senator Jones of New Mexico refused to introduce\r\nthe Suffrage Resolution again, but Senator Jones of Washington, the\r\nranking Republican, introduced the identical bill. The President\r\nexpressed his regret over the failure of the measure on February 10, but\r\nhe did not exert his influence towards getting it passed.\r\n\r\nThe Sixty-fifth Congress was about to adjourn in a few days. On February\r\n28, in order to overcome the Parliamentary difficulty of the\r\nreconsideration of a measure which had been once reconsidered, Senator\r\nJones of New Mexico introduced a Suffrage Amendment which was a\r\nvariation of the Anthony Amendment and so of course to Suffragists not\r\nso satisfactory. It was referred to the Woman Suffrage Committee. Soon\r\nafter this, Senator Gay of Louisiana, who had voted against the\r\nAmendment on February 10, announced that he would now vote for it. The\r\nPresident had obtained this vote, but like all his action on Suffrage,\r\nit came too late. There were only three days left and Senator Jones of\r\nNew Mexico made several attempts to obtain the necessary unanimous\r\nconsent for the consideration of his Resolution, but he was\r\nunsuccessful. On Saturday, March 1, Senator Wadsworth (Republican)\r\nobjected. On Monday, March 3, Senator Weeks (Republican) objected. On\r\nTuesday, March 4, Senator Sherman (Republican) objected. The session\r\ncame to an end in the Senate without action on the Suffrage Amendment.\r\nThe Republicans did not want the Democrats to get the credit of passing\r\nit, and so prevented it from coming to a vote.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XIV\r\n\r\n              THE APPEAL TO THE PRESIDENT ON HIS DEPARTURE\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN Congress adjourned at noon March 3, President Wilson left\r\nimmediately for Europe, stopping in New York to speak at the\r\nMetropolitan Opera House. Alice Paul arranged at once a demonstration in\r\nNew York as a protest against the President leaving the Suffrage\r\nquestion still unsettled. Her plan was to have every word on democracy,\r\nuttered by the President inside the Opera House, immediately burned\r\noutside the Opera House.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of March 4 a long line of Suffragists started from the\r\nNew York Headquarters at 13 East Forty-first Street. Margaretta Schuyler\r\ncarried the American flag. Lucy Maverick followed her carrying the\r\npurple, white, and gold tri-color. Florence De Shan carried:\r\n\r\n          MR. PRESIDENT, HOW LONG MUST WOMEN WAIT FOR LIBERTY?\r\n\r\nBeatrice Castleton bore:\r\n\r\n          MR. PRESIDENT, HOW LONG MUST WOMEN WAIT FOR LIBERTY?\r\n\r\nThe lettered banner for the occasion said:\r\n\r\n           MR. PRESIDENT, AMERICAN WOMEN PROTEST AGAINST THE\r\n          DEFEAT OF SUFFRAGE FOR WHICH YOU AND YOUR PARTY ARE\r\n         RESPONSIBLE. WE DEMAND THAT YOU CALL AN EXTRA SESSION\r\n        OF CONGRESS IMMEDIATELY TO PASS THE SUFFRAGE AMENDMENT.\r\n               AN AUTOCRAT AT HOME IS A POOR CHAMPION FOR\r\n                           DEMOCRACY ABROAD.\r\n\r\nAt the corner of Fortieth Street and Broadway, this line met a barrier\r\nof more than a hundred policemen. As the Suffragists tried to pass\r\nthrough them, the police—assisted by soldiers and sailors from the\r\ncrowd—rushed upon them; tore down the banners; broke them.\r\n\r\nIn her book, _Jailed for Freedom_, Doris Stevens tells how in perfect\r\nsilence, but in the most business-like way, the New York police clubbed\r\nthe pickets. They arrested six of the women; Alice Paul, Elsie Hill,\r\nDoris Stevens, Beatrice Castleton, Lucy Maverick, Marie Bodenheim. These\r\nwere taken to the police station charged with disorderly conduct. After\r\nhalf an hour, they were suddenly released.\r\n\r\nThey went back to Headquarters, re-formed into a second line and started\r\nfor the Opera House. At Fortieth Street, the police again rushed them,\r\ntearing and breaking their flags. The women were knocked down. Some were\r\ntrampled underfoot, and picked up later, limp and bleeding from scrapes\r\nand bruises. Elsie Hill succeeded in retaining her torch. She began her\r\nmeeting of protest. A messenger emerged from the Opera House with some\r\nof the words which the President had just uttered, and she burned them.\r\nThe police rushed upon her, but they were too late. In the meantime,\r\nAlice Paul had succeeded in bringing the line of Suffragists up to the\r\nwall of police. There the crowds dashed on them again.\r\n\r\nWith the wonderful spirit which always characterized her, Elsie Hill\r\ncalled out to one of the soldiers: Did you fellows turn back when you\r\nsaw the Germans come? What would you have thought of any one who did? Do\r\nyou expect us to turn back now? We never turn back either—and we won’t\r\nuntil democracy is won!\r\n\r\nFinally the police pushed the crowds back so far that there was no\r\naudience. The pickets returned to Headquarters. There they found that\r\nall the evening long, lawless citizens had been breaking in, carrying\r\nout great bundles of banners and burning them in the street.\r\n\r\nDoris Stevens tells in _Jailed for Freedom_ how, when she attempted to\r\nenter Headquarters, she was knocked down by a hoodlum armed with one of\r\ntheir banner poles.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat night and the following day, sailors, privates and\r\nofficers—military and naval—called at Suffrage Headquarters to apologize\r\nfor the conduct of other men in uniform. They begged the women to\r\nbelieve that their action was not representative of the attitude of\r\nservice men in general.\r\n\r\nThe Sixty-sixth Congress convened in special session on May 19, 1919,\r\nwith the Republicans in control.\r\n\r\nThe Suffragists knew before this Congress convened, that it would pass\r\nthe Anthony Amendment.\r\n\r\nThis was how it happened.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   XV\r\n\r\n      THE PRESIDENT OBTAINS THE LAST VOTE AND CONGRESS SURRENDERS\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE Suffrage situation was a little confused. Senator Baird, opposed to\r\nSuffrage, of the old Congress, was succeeded by Edge, favorable to it.\r\nPollock, favorable, was succeeded by Dial, opposed. Vardaman of\r\nMississippi, favorable, was succeeded by Harrison. Drew of New\r\nHampshire, opposed, was succeeded by Keyes. Hardwick of Georgia,\r\nopposed, was succeeded by Harris. These three last new Senators—Harrison\r\n(Democrat), Harris (Democrat), and Keyes (Republican)—maintained a\r\nsteady silence as to how they would vote. It was necessary to get one of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nSenator Harris was a close supporter of President Wilson. Alice Paul\r\nknew that Matthew Hale, former Chairman of the Progressive National\r\nCommittee, a Suffragist but not a Democrat, was influential with the\r\nAdministration. She therefore suggested to Anita Pollitzer that she see\r\nMr. Hale at once and lay the situation before him. This was early in May\r\nand Congress was convening May 19. Mr. Hale was enthusiastic in his\r\ndesire to help. The situation was complicated by the fact that the\r\nPresident was in Europe. Mr. Hale and Miss Pollitzer went over the\r\nSenate poll and from among the most favorable non-committal senators\r\nchose Harris of Georgia. He too was in Europe. Suddenly the field of the\r\ncampaign crossed three thousand miles of Atlantic Ocean to France. The\r\nWoman’s Party concentrated their forces on getting President Wilson to\r\ninfluence Harris into declaring for Suffrage. Mr. Hale worked steadily\r\nwith a group of people close to the President who rapidly increased in\r\nnumbers. Ultimately this pressure bore fruit in a conference between\r\nRobert Woolley, Democratic Publicity Manager in the 1916 campaign, Homer\r\nS. Cummings, Chairman of the National Democratic Committee, William J.\r\nCochran, Director of Publicity of the Democratic Committee, Joseph\r\nTumulty, the President’s Secretary, Senator Walsh. The result of this\r\nconference was that Tumulty sent a cable to the President, suggesting\r\nthat he confer with Senator Harris. Senator Harris was in Italy, but at\r\nthe President’s request he went to France. Immediately came the news on\r\nthe cable that Senator Harris would support the Suffrage Amendment.\r\n\r\nHaving secured Harris’ vote, President Wilson cabled a message to the\r\nnew Congress on the night of May 20 which contained the following\r\nreference to the Susan B. Anthony Amendment:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Will you permit me, turning from these matters, to speak once more\r\n    and very earnestly of the proposed Amendment to the Constitution\r\n    which would extend the Suffrage to women and which passed the House\r\n    of Representatives at the last session of the Congress? It seems to\r\n    me that every consideration of justice and of public advantage calls\r\n    for the immediate adoption of that Amendment and its submission\r\n    forthwith to the legislatures of the several States.\r\n\r\n    Throughout all the world this long-delayed extension of the Suffrage\r\n    is looked for; in the United States, longer, I believe, than\r\n    anywhere else, the necessity for it, and the immense advantages of\r\n    it to the national life, has been urged and debated by women and men\r\n    who saw the need for it and urged the policy of it when it required\r\n    steadfast courage to be so much beforehand with the common\r\n    conviction; and I, for one, covet for our country the distinction of\r\n    being among the first to act in a great reform.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs soon as Suffrage was assured by this sixty-fourth vote, Senator Keyes\r\nand Senator Hale in a convulsive effort to leap on the fast disappearing\r\nband-wagon announced that they would vote for the Amendment, thus giving\r\nthe Suffragists two extra votes.\r\n\r\nAs this was a new Congress it was necessary for the House to pass the\r\nSuffrage Amendment again. On May 21, 1919, therefore, the new House\r\npassed it by three hundred and four votes to eighty-nine—forty-two more\r\nthan the required two-thirds. It will be remembered that, when the\r\nprevious House passed it on January 10, 1918, the vote was two hundred\r\nand seventy-four to one hundred and thirty-six—only one vote more than\r\nthe required two-thirds.\r\n\r\nThe Amendment then went to the Senate.\r\n\r\nIn her _Revelations of a Woman Lobbyist_, Maud Younger says:\r\n\r\nFour months later, on June fourth, for the fifth time in a little more\r\nthan a year, we sat in the Senate gallery to hear a vote on the Suffrage\r\nAmendment. The new Congress, coming in on March fourth, had brought us\r\ntwo more votes—we now had our eleven. There was no excitement. The\r\ncoming of the women, the waiting of the women, the expectancy of the\r\nwomen, was an old story. A whole year had passed in the winning of two\r\nvotes. Every one knew what the end would be now. It was all very dull.\r\n\r\nWe walked slowly homeward, talking a little, silent a great deal. This\r\nwas the day toward which women had been struggling for more than half a\r\ncentury! We were in the dawn of woman’s political power in America.\r\nSeveral days before the Senate passed the Amendment, Alice Paul left\r\nWashington to arrange for an immediate ratification by the legislatures\r\nin session.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XVI\r\n\r\n                              RATIFICATION\r\n\r\n                “WOMEN ARE FREE AT LAST IN ALL THE LAND”\r\n\r\n                             _Chant Royal_\r\n\r\n           Waken, O Woman, to the trumpet sound\r\n               Greeting our day of long sought liberty;\r\n           Gone are the ages that have held us bound\r\n               Beneath a master, now we stand as he,\r\n           Free for world-service unto all mankind,\r\n           Free of the dragging chains that used to bind,\r\n               The sordid labor, the unnoticed woe,\r\n               The helpless shame, the unresisted blow,\r\n           Submission to our owner’s least command—\r\n               No longer pets or slaves are we, for lo!\r\n           Women are free at last in all the land.\r\n\r\n           Long was the stony road our feet have found\r\n               From that dark past to the new world we see,\r\n           Each step with heavy hindrance hemmed around,\r\n               Each door to freedom closed with bolt and key;\r\n           Our feet with old tradition all entwined,\r\n           Untrained, uneducated, uncombined,\r\n               We had to fight old faiths of long ago,\r\n               And in our households find our dearest foe,\r\n           Against the world’s whole weight we had to stand\r\n               Till came the day it could no more say no—\r\n           Women are free at last in all the land.\r\n\r\n           Around us prejudice, emotion-drowned,\r\n               Rose like a flood and would not let us free;\r\n           Women themselves, soft-bred and silken gowned,\r\n               Historic shame have won by their mad plea\r\n           To keep their own subjection; with them lined\r\n           All evil forces of the world we find,\r\n               No crime so brazen and no vice so low\r\n               But fought us, with inertia blind and slow,\r\n           And ignorance beneath its darkling brand,\r\n               these we strove and still must strive, although\r\n           Women are free at last in all the land.\r\n\r\n           The serving squaw, the peasant, toil-embrowned,\r\n               The household drudge, no honor and no fee—\r\n           For these we now see women world-renowned,\r\n               In art and science, work of all degree.\r\n           She whom world progress had left far behind\r\n           Now has the secret of full life divined,—\r\n               Her largest service gladly to bestow;\r\n               Great is the gain since ages far below,\r\n           In honored labor, of head and hand;\r\n               Now may her power and genius clearly show\r\n           Women are free at last in all the land.\r\n\r\n           Long years of effort to her praise redound,\r\n               To such high courage all may bend the knee,\r\n           Beside her brother, with full freedom crowned,\r\n               Mother and wife and citizen is she,\r\n           Queen of her soul and body, heart and mind,\r\n           Strong for the noble service God designed;\r\n               See now the marching millions, row on row,\r\n               With steady eyes and faces all aglow,\r\n           They come! they come! a glad triumphant band,—\r\n               Roses and laurels in their pathway strow—\r\n           Women are free at last in all the land!\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 ENVOI\r\n\r\n            Sisters! we now must change the world we know\r\n            To one great garden where the child may grow.\r\n                New freedom means new duty, broad and grand.\r\n            To make a better world and hold it so\r\n                Women are free at last in all the land.\r\n                      CHARLOTTE PERKINS GILMAN,\r\n                      _The Suffragist_, September, 1920.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE Suffrage Amendment had now passed both the House of Representatives\r\nand the Senate. One step was necessary before it became a part of the\r\nConstitution of the United States—ratification by the legislatures of\r\nthree-quarters of the States in the Union—by thirty-six States out of\r\nforty-eight. No time limit was set by Congress on ratification, but\r\nnaturally Suffragists wanted it to come as soon as possible. Some people\r\nbelieved it would take twenty years. They did not reckon with Alice Paul\r\nhowever.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Congress passed the Suffrage Amendment, the whole\r\nsituation—as far as Suffrage was concerned—changed. Now the President,\r\nthe leaders in the Administration, the leaders in the great political\r\nParties became potential allies.\r\n\r\nIn four States—Wisconsin, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts—the\r\nLegislatures were in regular session. In three States—Texas, Ohio,\r\nMichigan—called on matters not pertaining to Suffrage, the Legislatures\r\nwere in special session. The first undertaking of the Woman’s Party was\r\nto get the convening Legislatures to ratify and the remaining States to\r\ncall special sessions.\r\n\r\nA race as to who should be the first to ratify, set in between\r\nWisconsin, Michigan, and Illinois. All three ratified on June 10. But\r\nIllinois had to re-ratify later on June 17 because of an error in\r\nprinting the Amendment on its first ratification on June 10. As between\r\nthe other two, Wisconsin won.\r\n\r\nThe story of Wisconsin’s part in the race is interesting and humorous.\r\nD. G. James, the father of Ada James, former Chairman of the Wisconsin\r\nBranch of the Woman’s Party, was spending the day in Madison when the\r\nLegislature ratified. His daughter was, of course, exceedingly desirous\r\nthat Wisconsin should achieve the honor of the first ratification, and\r\nhe was equally desirous of aiding her. He assisted her in every way to\r\navoid official delays and in getting the action of the Legislature\r\nproperly certified. He commandeered his daughter’s traveling bag, made a\r\nfew swift purchases of the necessities of traveling, and caught the\r\nfirst train to Washington. He procured a signed statement that\r\nWisconsin’s ratification was the first to be received from the\r\nDepartment of State, on June 13. He brought his trophy in triumph to\r\nHeadquarters and told his story to the newspaper men while the statement\r\nwas being photographed.\r\n\r\nThat statement runs as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n                        DEPARTMENT OF STATE\r\n\r\n                           WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n                                                          June 13, 1919.\r\n\r\n    By direction of the Acting Secretary of State, I hereby acknowledge\r\n    the receipt of a certified copy of the Joint Resolution of the\r\n    Legislature of the State of Wisconsin, ratifying the proposed\r\n    Amendment to the Constitution of the United States extending the\r\n    right of Suffrage to women, which was delivered by Special\r\n    Messenger, D. G. James, on June 13, 1919, and is the first\r\n    ratification of the Amendment which has been received.\r\n\r\n                                                           J. A. TOWNER,\r\n                                                        Chief of Bureau.\r\n\r\n\r\nMichigan, almost neck and neck in the race with Wisconsin, ratified on\r\nJune 10. Kansas, Ohio, and New York ratified on June 16. Kansas was the\r\nfirst State to call its Legislature in special session to ratify the\r\nSuffrage Amendment, the first also in which the legislators paid their\r\nown expenses to attend the special session. Illinois, held up by that\r\nmistake in printing, ratified on June 17.\r\n\r\nPennsylvania, the first non-Suffrage State, ratified on June 24, but not\r\nwithout a struggle. The session of the Legislature was drawing to a\r\nclose and it was difficult to get the measure introduced. The National\r\nWoman’s Party made a strenuous campaign. Mrs. Lawrence Lewis, Chairman\r\nof the Pennsylvania Ratification Committee, enlisted the aid of Governor\r\nSproul and in a conference with Senator Penrose, who had been one of the\r\nstrongest opponents to the Suffrage Amendment in the United States\r\nSenate, persuaded him to give his support to ratification. Mary Ingham,\r\nthe State Chairman, brought all the Woman’s Party forces in the State to\r\nbear upon the situation. The scene in the Senate when the vote was taken\r\nwas highly colorful. The floor was a waving mass of purple, white, and\r\ngold. The tri-color badges of the National Woman’s Party appeared\r\neverywhere on the floor and among the audience. There was such demand\r\nfor the Woman’s Party colors that at the last moment the stock had to be\r\nreplenished. After the final victory in the House, a parade of purple,\r\nwhite, and gold blazed its way through Harrisburg.\r\n\r\nMassachusetts followed close on Pennsylvania, ratifying on June 25.\r\nAgnes Morey, the State Chairman of the National Woman’s Party, assisted\r\nby members of the State branch, and by Betty Gram, national organizer,\r\nmade the intensive drive on the Legislature, which resulted in their\r\nbringing the Bay State into camp. Here, Senator Lodge, another hitherto\r\nunchangeable opponent to the Suffrage Amendment in the United States\r\nSenate, did not oppose the measure when it came up before the\r\nMassachusetts Legislature, although he did not give the support which\r\nPenrose of Pennsylvania gave.\r\n\r\nTexas, the first Democratic “one-party” State to do so, ratified by\r\nspecial session on June 28. Iowa, after an appeal for a special session\r\nfrom Senator Cummins to Governor Harding—this was done at the instance\r\nof the Woman’s Party—ratified on July 2; Missouri ratified by special\r\nsession on July 3.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the Legislature of Alabama, which only convenes once in\r\nfour years, met and although Suffragists had not wanted this session and\r\nhad very little hope of success, they conducted a campaign for\r\nratification. As it was the first Democratic State in which there was\r\ndifficulty, an appeal was made to the President. He despatched the\r\nfollowing telegrams:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                            WHITE HOUSE,\r\n                                                          July 12, 1919.\r\n\r\n    Hon. Thomas E. Kilby, Governor,\r\n\r\n          Montgomery, Alabama.\r\n\r\n    I hope you will pardon me if I express my very earnest hope that the\r\n    Suffrage Amendment to the Constitution of the United States may be\r\n    ratified by the great State of Alabama.\r\n\r\n    It would constitute a very happy augury for the future and add\r\n    greatly to the strength of the movement which, in my judgment, is\r\n    based upon the highest considerations, both of justice and\r\n    experience.\r\n\r\n                                                         WOODROW WILSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                             WHITE HOUSE\r\n                                                          July 14, 1919.\r\n\r\n    Hon. H. P. Merritt,\r\n\r\n      Speaker of House of Representatives,\r\n\r\n        Montgomery, Alabama.\r\n\r\n    I hope that you will not think that I am taking an unwarranted\r\n    liberty in saying that I earnestly hope, as do all friends of the\r\n    great liberal movement which it represents, that the legislature of\r\n    Alabama will ratify the Suffrage Amendment to the Constitution of\r\n    the United States. It would give added hope and courage to the\r\n    friends of justice and enlightened policy everywhere and would\r\n    constitute the best possible augury for future liberal policy of\r\n    every sort.\r\n\r\n                                                         WOODROW WILSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlabama was the first State in which ratification was defeated.\r\n\r\nBy this time, the Legislature in Georgia was convening. Suffragists had\r\nno more hope of ratification here than in Alabama. Nevertheless the\r\ncampaign was made. They appealed to the national Democratic leaders for\r\nhelp and the President despatched the following telegram:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                            WHITE HOUSE,\r\n                                                          July 14, 1919.\r\n\r\n    Governor Hugh M. Dorsey,\r\n\r\n      State Capitol,\r\n\r\n        Atlanta, Georgia.\r\n\r\n    I am profoundly interested in the passage of the Suffrage Amendment\r\n    to the Constitution, and will very much value your advice as to the\r\n    present status of the matter in the Georgia legislature. I would\r\n    like very much to be of help, for I believe it to be absolutely\r\n    essential to the political future of the country that the Amendment\r\n    be passed. It is absolutely essential to the future of the\r\n    Democratic Party that it take a leading part in this great reform.\r\n\r\n                                                         WOODROW WILSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorgia defeated ratification July 24, although the national Democratic\r\nleaders had aided in the entire campaign.\r\n\r\nArkansas ratified on July 20; Montana, July 20; Nebraska on August 2,\r\nall by special session.\r\n\r\nThen came a lull in the ratification race. By August, only two States\r\nwest of the Mississippi, had ratified and to the great surprise—and the\r\nintense disappointment—of Suffragists, the West continued to maintain\r\nthis lethargy.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, there came a special session for good roads in\r\nVirginia, another Democratic State. Since the session was meeting, the\r\nSuffragists had no alternative but to make the fight. In Virginia, they\r\nrelied again on the Democratic national leaders to overcome the\r\nopposition of the local Democratic leaders. As in the case of Alabama\r\nand Georgia, although the national leaders did much, they did not do\r\nenough. The President, however, despatched the following letter:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                        August 22, 1919.\r\n\r\n    President of the Senate,\r\n\r\n      Richmond, Virginia.\r\n\r\n    May I not take the liberty of expressing my profound interest in the\r\n    action which the Legislature of my native State is to take in the\r\n    matter of the Suffrage Amendment to the United States Constitution.\r\n    It seems to me of profound importance to our country that this\r\n    Amendment should be adopted and I venture to urge the adoption on\r\n    the Legislature. With utmost respect and with the greatest\r\n    earnestness,\r\n\r\n                                                         WOODROW WILSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nVirginia did not ratify.\r\n\r\nDuring all this period campaigns for special sessions continued. Typical\r\nof these is the following account by Julia Emory, national organizer, in\r\nthe July _Suffragist_:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “Good-by, good luck, and don’t come back until Maryland ratifies!”\r\n    This from the group of National Headquarters when I waved farewell\r\n    and started over the hills and far away toward a special session in\r\n    Maryland. Over the hills to Baltimore, and then early the next\r\n    morning, very, very early, the big bay boat splashed down the\r\n    Chesapeake to Cambridge where Governor Harrington was spending the\r\n    week-end.\r\n\r\n    “It’s good of you to come,” the Governor greeted me. “Not good of\r\n    me, but necessary, Governor, to let you know how much women need a\r\n    special session in Maryland, now. Not just the 15,000 Maryland women\r\n    of our organization who have asked me to come to you, but all the\r\n    women in the United States.” “Ah!” said he. “You ladies are too\r\n    impatient. We will have a regular session in January, why can’t you\r\n    wait till then?” “Because,” I answered, “there is no need of\r\n    prolonging the struggle. We have the necessary thirty-six States in\r\n    view. We want the special session so that we can vote for the next\r\n    Governor of Maryland at the election this November, and for members\r\n    of our legislature at the same election.” “But the question of\r\n    expense,” he suggested. “That is easily eliminated,” I said. “Take\r\n    Kansas, for example, where the legislators waived all pay and\r\n    mileage in order to push forward ratification. Surely our Maryland\r\n    men will do the same. And, anyhow, two days at the outside would see\r\n    the thing through. Think of the taxes women have paid for so many\r\n    years. Think of the war for Democracy, think of the part women gave\r\n    in human sacrifice, service and money, and then tell me if anybody\r\n    would say that a special session called for the purpose of giving\r\n    them a voice in their government would take too much out of the\r\n    State treasury.” “That’s true,” said the Governor, “but special\r\n    sessions are unpopular, and suppose the resolution should fail——”\r\n    “Oh!” I said with a beaming smile of relief, “if what you want is a\r\n    convincing poll, I’ll give you that,” thinking of the poll which,\r\n    though still not yet completed, already showed a majority pledged in\r\n    both Houses. “Next Tuesday,” said he. “Now,” said I. It was then\r\n    Friday. But the Governor said Tuesday, and told me that in the\r\n    meantime he was going to “feel around” for sentiment. And so did I.\r\n\r\n    First I went to a State Senator. “Why the special session?” he\r\n    wanted to know. And when he found the thirty-six States were in\r\n    view, he sat up. “The thing is upon us,” he said. We went over the\r\n    situation from the political point of view from beginning to end. He\r\n    was a Democrat. “And,” said he in a low voice, “if I had to bet on\r\n    the fall elections, I’d—well, all I have to say is, if the Democrats\r\n    want to get any credit, it’ll have to be by special session.”\r\n\r\n    “Will you say that to the Governor?” I asked.\r\n\r\n    “I will, tonight,” he said, “and as for the question of expense, I\r\n    for one, will waive my pay.” Just then the train whistled. “You\r\n    can’t make it,” said the Senator. “We are some distance from the\r\n    station.” “I must,” I said. “I have to see another man.”\r\n\r\n    The Senator laughed and called to a man in an automobile and away I\r\n    whisked and the conductor helped me to hop on the train as it moved\r\n    off.\r\n\r\n    The man at the other end was in Chicago. And the next train was due\r\n    in six hours. Then on to a little town where I sat on a pile of\r\n    baggage and waited until the Republican delegate arrived. “I hope,”\r\n    he said, “that the Republicans will take the initiative and ask for\r\n    a special session. Yes, you bet, I’ll waive my pay.”\r\n\r\n    Then a Democrat, who said he would fight a special session to a\r\n    finish. “Knowing what it will mean to your Party if you do?” I\r\n    asked. We went into it from the political viewpoint. Then he saw the\r\n    end in sight. We carefully went over the thirty-six States. He\r\n    rubbed his head and looked at the opposite wall (or it may have been\r\n    the State of Maryland he was gazing at so intently). “You know,” he\r\n    said finally, “I am an anti-Suffragist at heart, but at the same\r\n    time I am no fool. The thing is here, and the point is, what is the\r\n    best thing to do about it. I will not urge a special session, but I\r\n    will not fight it.”\r\n\r\n    Then on Tuesday, Mrs. Donald Hooker, our Maryland Chairman, went\r\n    over the poll with the Governor. Man by man, they considered the\r\n    delegates and senators. Yes, this one was sure, that one was\r\n    practically sure but wasn’t pledged and so we wouldn’t count him\r\n    yet, another was hopeful, another was hopeless, and the then\r\n    uncompleted poll stood fifty-nine to thirty-eight in the House and\r\n    thirteen to eleven in the Senate. We looked expectantly at the\r\n    Governor. “I need more time to consider,” was what he said.\r\n\r\n    “In the meantime,” said Mrs. Hooker to me as we went out, “we will\r\n    complete the poll as fast as possible. A big majority will surely\r\n    convince him that it must go through.”\r\n\r\n    So off to Southern Maryland and the counties around Washington. One\r\n    legislator I found in Washington in a big, cool office, dressed in a\r\n    Palm Beach suit and on the point of departing for a vacation. I\r\n    looked at him and thought of canoes and bathing suits which had been\r\n    shoved aside for me till after the special session. “I hope you will\r\n    have a good time,” I told him. “Mine will come after you have voted\r\n    ‘yes.’” He smiled happily and his reply made me smile happily too.\r\n\r\n    One man was in his wheat field. ‘Way into the country we went by\r\n    automobile where no trains ran and no electric cars penetrated. We\r\n    reached the town and inquired at the hardware store for our\r\n    legislator: “Mr. F——? Oh, he don’t live here, he just has his mail\r\n    sent here, he lives ’bout fo’teen mile round yonder.” “Fo’teen mile\r\n    round yonder,” we finally found his home. “Well, you see it’s this\r\n    way,” explained his wife. “He might’ve been home, but Mr. So-and-So\r\n    is thrashing wheat and my husband went over to help him get it in\r\n    before the storm.” We noticed clouds in the sky. We went on to the\r\n    So-and-Sos’ farm. At the farmhouse, we all alighted. My companions\r\n    immediately made for the chicken yard where they made friends with\r\n    Mrs. So-and-So and helped her to feed the chickens. Afterward, they\r\n    told us of the strong Suffrage speech the farmer’s wife had made to\r\n    them, who being the mother of eight children—six girls and two\r\n    boys—had come to the conclusion that nobody needed Suffrage more\r\n    than the farmer’s wife. Two of the little girls took me out to the\r\n    field, up a dusty white road we walked, climbed rail fences and—oh!\r\n    how good! picked a few blackberries—and came at last to the\r\n    thrashing field. “No,” said my man, “I can’t see that Suffrage is\r\n    right, and I can’t therefore vote for it.” “Did you think the war\r\n    was right?” I asked. “Oh! of course.” “And why did we go to war?” I\r\n    asked. “To get democracy,” he answered. “Exactly,” I said. “And\r\n    President Wilson said that democracy was ‘the right of all those who\r\n    submit to authority to have a voice in their own government.’” “Now\r\n    look here, Missie,” said my friend, “I believe women are superior\r\n    beings to men, and if they were to vote, they’d have to be equals.\r\n    Now look at this hay stack. You could no more pitch hay than——”\r\n    “Will you lend me your fork?” I asked. I stuck in the form, gave it\r\n    the peculiar little twist, then the little flop, squared my shoulder\r\n    and up it went on the wagon. Three times. “Well, I’ll be jiggered,”\r\n    laughed the legislator, “labor is scarce and now I’ll know where to\r\n    look for help when I need it!” “Yes,” said I. “And we have come to\r\n    you for help. We need your vote.”\r\n\r\n    On to the next, we climbed into the machine and sped away.\r\n\r\n    And so it runs. Sometimes, we strike an obstinate anti who will not\r\n    even listen to what we have to say, even though I have traveled\r\n    weary miles in trains and on foot to find him. Sometimes we have to\r\n    put up at a funny little village hotel because an inconsiderate\r\n    legislator has gone out of town for a day. Sometimes they are\r\n    cordial, and offer all sorts of help. Sometimes the road lies\r\n    through beautiful country, occasionally in hot, stuffy little towns.\r\n    At fastest, it is slow work. Why do legislators live so far apart\r\n    and in such inaccessible places? And generally so very far from\r\n    anything to eat! Some evenings as it begins to grow dark, I am\r\n    keenly aware that I have had nothing to eat since breakfast. But\r\n    that is part of the game, and after all what does it matter when I\r\n    can write to Headquarters before I fall into bed, “We can add the\r\n    following names of legislators to the list of pledged, and all of\r\n    them have offered to waive their pay.” So far only one has refused\r\n    to waive pay.\r\n\r\n    So, with a big majority in both houses pledged to vote for the\r\n    measure, there remains nothing but the calling of the special\r\n    session. This, it is up to Governor Harrington to do at once.\r\n\r\n    And this, according to the following answer to Attorney General\r\n    Palmer’s letter, he still refuses to do. Yet the Governor must\r\n    surely yet see the light, as he knows that there IS no question of\r\n    defeat if a special session is called to ratify.\r\n\r\n    The poll which has been so carefully and accurately drawn up\r\n    demonstrates that fact most convincingly, and we are going to keep\r\n    right on working until Governor Harrington sees it that way!\r\n\r\n\r\nMaryland defeated ratification later.\r\n\r\nOwing to the fact that most of the governors who must call special\r\nsessions were Republicans, the National Woman’s Party made a drive on\r\nthe national Republican leaders to get them to act upon these governors.\r\nOn August 14, Abby Scott Baker went to the Governors’ Conference at Salt\r\nLake City where, assisted by Louise Garnett, State Chairman of the\r\nWoman’s Party in Utah, she succeeded in getting governors whose\r\nLegislatures had already ratified to organize an informal committee to\r\nwork upon those whose Legislatures had not ratified. Some of these\r\ngovernors of these backward States—or rather some of the backward\r\ngovernors of these States—made tentative promises in regard to special\r\nsessions, but these promises were so vague that Mrs. Baker started, at\r\nthe close of the Governors’ Conference, to California. We shall hear\r\nabout her work there later.\r\n\r\nMinnesota ratified on September 8; New Hampshire on September 10, both\r\nin special session. Utah—but there is a story about Utah.\r\n\r\nUtah was backward. Alice Paul interested Isaac Russell, a newspaper man,\r\nand a native of Utah, in the situation. He prevailed upon Senator Smoot,\r\nRepublican, to write a letter to Alice Paul saying that he was\r\ndisappointed that Governor Bamberger, Democrat, was not calling a\r\nspecial session. Alice Paul gave this letter to the Press, and of\r\ncourse, the Republican papers of Utah carried it. Alice Paul waited a\r\nwhile and then she sent Anita Pollitzer to see the Democratic\r\nCongressmen from Utah, and to put it clearly to them that the\r\nresponsibility for the delay was on their Party. As a result of Miss\r\nPollitzer’s representations, Congressman Welling, a Democrat and a\r\nfriend of Governor Bamberger, wrote a strong telegram to him in which he\r\nurged him to set the date of a special session at once. Early the next\r\nmorning, Congressman Welling telephoned Headquarters that the telegram\r\nhad brought results and read a message from Governor Bamberger\r\nannouncing the date on which he would call that special session. Utah\r\nratified on September 30.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, we must go back to Abby Scott Baker, whom we left on\r\nher way to California. She found that an enormous amount of work had\r\nbeen done by Genevieve Allen, the State Chairman for California, and by\r\nthe members of her organization, assisted by Vivian Pierce, a national\r\norganizer. Governor Stevens, however, seemed immovable on the subject of\r\na special session. But with additional assistance from Mrs. William\r\nKent, one of its national officers, the Woman’s Party inaugurated a\r\nvigorous newspaper campaign. Governor Stevens found himself inundated by\r\nan avalanche of telegrams, letters, petitions, resolutions; and finally\r\nof entreaties of the men who surrounded him. Governor Stevens is a\r\nRepublican, and the Democratic women began to organize for ratification.\r\nSenator Phelan, Democrat, gave them his assistance. National leaders of\r\nboth Parties brought pressure to bear. It was impossible to resist this\r\ncurrent. Governor Stevens issued a call for a special session for\r\nNovember 1, and on that date California ratified.\r\n\r\nThe Woman’s Party refers to Maine as the first close call. This story is\r\nvery interesting. Maine called a special session, but Maine was, so to\r\nspeak, on the fence in regard to Suffrage, as, when the National Woman’s\r\nParty approached the State on the subject of ratification, a referendum\r\non Presidential Suffrage was pending. So important was the situation\r\nthere that Alice Paul joined Mrs. Lawrence Lewis and Mrs. Robert Treat\r\nWhitehouse, the State Chairman, who were working hard. In Maine, too,\r\nthe antis were troublesome. They managed to introduce a resolution in\r\nthe Legislature proposing postponement on the subject of ratification\r\nuntil after the referendum. The President and Secretary of the State\r\nFederation of Labor sent an official appeal to the Legislature to vote\r\nfor this resolution. Immediately the Woman’s Party in Washington\r\nobtained a letter from Secretary Morrison of the American Federation of\r\nLabor to the Maine Federation, stating that the A. F. of L. stood\r\nstrongly for ratification. Mrs. Whitehouse gave this letter to the\r\nnewspapers; gave copies to every member of the Legislature. She\r\nconferred with the President of the State Federation, persuaded him to\r\nrepudiate his former letter and to issue an appeal for the support of\r\nratification. National leaders of both the Democratic and Republican\r\nParties sent telegrams to legislators. Maine ratified on November 5—by a\r\nnarrow margin of four votes.\r\n\r\nAfter a long siege by the Woman’s Party on the Governor, North Dakota\r\nratified in special session on December 1.\r\n\r\nIn the case of South Dakota, Governor Norbeck agreed to call a special\r\nsession of the Legislature if the majority of the members would serve\r\nwithout mileage. Late in November, Alice Paul received a telegram from\r\nGovernor Norbeck saying that the session would not be called as he was\r\nsixteen answers short of a majority who were willing to serve without\r\nexpense to the State. Alice Paul immediately sent Anita Pollitzer to the\r\nCapitol to see Senator Sterling of South Dakota. Miss Pollitzer showed\r\nhim Governor Norbeck’s telegram to Miss Paul and told him that the\r\nSuffragists would be greatly disappointed if the Republican Legislature\r\nof South Dakota refused to meet, and a Republican Governor refuse to\r\ncall a special session. He agreed that was a political mistake and in\r\nMiss Pollitzer’s presence, sent telegrams to his law partner, the chief\r\npolitician of the State, telling him to do everything possible to have a\r\nspecial session called; to the Chairman of the Republican State\r\nCommittee, asking him to telegraph each member of the Legislature,\r\nurging him to answer the Governor’s appeal and to agree to come to the\r\nspecial session as the Governor had stipulated, at his own expense.\r\nExamining this situation superficially—or even closely—one would think\r\nthat Miss Pollitzer had done everything that was possible. But there is\r\nno reckoning with Alice Paul. When Miss Pollitzer returned to\r\nHeadquarters, Miss Paul said simply, “We can do more.”\r\n\r\nThat afternoon Miss Pollitzer visited Mr. McCarl, the Secretary of the\r\nRepublican Congressional Committee in Washington, who sent telegrams to\r\nall the Republican leaders in the State, urging that they make clear to\r\nthe Republican Governor and to the members of the Legislature the\r\nimportance to the Republican Party of a good record on ratification.\r\nThree days later, a telegram came to Washington announcing that a\r\nmajority, willing to serve at their own expense, had been secured. South\r\nDakota ratified on December 4.\r\n\r\nColorado, the last State to ratify in 1919, did so on December 12—but\r\nonly after a long campaign, the result of local conditions.\r\n\r\nJanuary of 1920, in which five States came into the fold, was a highly\r\nsuccessful month for the ratification record. Rhode Island and Kentucky\r\nratified in regular session on January 6. Oregon, whose Governor broke\r\nhis promises many times, finally ratified in regular session on January\r\n12. The State Chairman, Mrs. W. J. Hawkins, campaigned vigorously here,\r\nassisted by her State organization and Vivian Pierce, national\r\norganizer. Much equally vigorous work in Washington supplemented her.\r\n\r\nIndiana ratified January 16 in special session.\r\n\r\nWyoming was the last of the five January States. For months, Governor\r\nCarey had refused to call a special session. He had been peculiarly\r\nobstinate at the Governors’ Conference at Salt Lake City on August 14,\r\nwhere he had stated that he would not call a special session even if it\r\nwere needed as the very last State. Wyoming, it should be remembered,\r\nwas the pioneer Suffrage State. Representatives of the Woman’s Party\r\nwent at once to Wyoming. Mrs. Richard Wainwright, who was staying in the\r\nWest, made it her special work to bring pressure on the Governor. Alice\r\nPaul sent Anita Pollitzer to the Capitol to talk with the Congressman\r\nand Senators from Wyoming. They said that circumstances had arisen which\r\nmade it impossible for them to try to force the Governor. On the trolley\r\ncar Miss Pollitzer met Frank Barrow, Secretary to Congressman Mondell,\r\nand asked him for help. He agreed to give it. Mr. Barrow had edited the\r\n_Cheyenne Tribune_, the leading Republican paper of the State, when\r\nAnita Pollitzer campaigned in Wyoming the year before. He began urging\r\nthat a special session be called and charged the Governor with hurting\r\nthe Republican record on Suffrage. Immediately a statement appeared in\r\nthe Press from the Governor, saying that he would call a special\r\nsession, but not at the expense of the State; that the men must come\r\nwithout pay or mileage. Wyoming is a huge State, and this was in\r\nJanuary, a month of terrific snow storms. Unless extra political\r\npressure was applied, the legislators might not come from far-away\r\nranches at their own expense. In the meantime, whenever politicians from\r\nWyoming arrived in Washington, members of the Woman’s Party saw them at\r\nonce. Party members learned that a close political advisor of Governor\r\nCarey was going to spend one night in Washington. They called on him at\r\nhis hotel and told him that the responsibility of all this delay lay\r\nsquarely on the Republicans and on Governor Carey. He was highly\r\nindignant at the attitude of the Woman’s Party and their Press campaign.\r\nNevertheless, he said that the Governor was going to call a special\r\nsession at once.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary to bring extra political pressure to bear, so long as\r\nGovernor Carey’s request for a special session put it up to the members\r\nof the Legislature, themselves, whether they would attend that session.\r\nAnita Pollitzer went to the Capitol and got the political line-up from\r\nthe political leaders. They divided the State into districts for her and\r\ntold her who were the political bellwethers of each district. With this\r\ninformation, Miss Pollitzer went to Dr. Simeon Fess, Chairman of the\r\nNational Republican Congressional Committee. Dr. Fess sent strong\r\ntelegrams to every one of the Republican State leaders asking them to\r\nround up the legislators of their district, to see that they agreed to\r\ngo to the special session at their own expense; asked them for a reply;\r\ntold them he would wire again if a reply was not received.\r\n\r\nOn January 27, both Houses of the Wyoming Legislature ratified\r\nunanimously.\r\n\r\nThe Governor of Nevada, a Democrat, had refused to call a special\r\nsession for many months because he was afraid that other measures\r\nbesides Suffrage would be brought up; but after a long pressure brought\r\nupon him by the national Democratic leaders, he was induced to call the\r\nsession. Nevada ratified February 7.\r\n\r\nThe next State in the ratification line was New Jersey, and New Jersey\r\ngave the Woman’s Party a terrific fight. Mrs. J. A. H. Hopkins, State\r\nChairman, realized that with both the Republican and Democratic bosses\r\nopposed to Suffrage, New Jersey would never ratify unless the Woman’s\r\nParty made it a matter of the greatest political importance to the\r\nmajority Party—the Republican Party. She engineered the fight, assisted\r\nby Betty Gram and Catherine Flanagan.\r\n\r\nIn Washington, Alice Paul sent Anita Pollitzer to Frank Barrow,\r\nSecretary to Congressman Mondell, who had assisted the Woman’s Party so\r\nsignally in the Wyoming campaign, and asked him to go to New Jersey.\r\n“But I could speak with no authority,” he said, “and Mr. Mondell will\r\nneed me here.” Anita Pollitzer told him that the Woman’s Party would\r\nattend to all those matters. She then went again to Dr. Fess, Chairman\r\nof the National Republican Congressional Committee, and told him that\r\nthey were likely to lose New Jersey unless somebody was immediately sent\r\nfrom the Congressional Committee to assist. At once, Dr. Fess wrote a\r\nletter to Mr. Barrow authorizing him to go to New Jersey in behalf of\r\nthe National Republican Congressional Committee. Miss Pollitzer next\r\nwent to Senator Poindexter, Chairman of the National Republican\r\nSenatorial Committee, and told him that the Woman’s Party wanted Mr.\r\nBarrow to go to New Jersey; that Dr. Fess had asked him to urge\r\nratification on behalf of the Republican Congressional Committee and\r\nthat the Woman’s Party wished him in addition to urge on behalf of the\r\nRepublican Senatorial Committee. Senator Poindexter, thereupon, wrote a\r\nletter to Mr. Barrow authorizing him to go to New Jersey in behalf of\r\nthe ratification of the Suffrage Amendment.\r\n\r\nLast of all, Miss Pollitzer went to Congressman Mondell and broke the\r\nnews to him that the Woman’s Party would like to commandeer his\r\nSecretary to go to New Jersey for as long a time as necessary, to work\r\namong Republicans for the ratification of Suffrage. Following an\r\nentirely natural impulse, Mr. Mondell said, “I am vitally interested in\r\nSuffrage, but I must say I need my own secretary in Washington!” Miss\r\nPollitzer of course represented to him how much it meant to the National\r\nWoman’s Party to have Mr. Barrow go—that it would take at the most only\r\na week out of his work; and that it might mean several years out of the\r\nlives of the women, if the Republicans allowed New Jersey to fail in\r\nratification. She added that the responsibility was on him and got up to\r\nleave. Mr. Mondell said, “Tell Mr. Barrow to be in his office in ten\r\nminutes, as I shall want to see him there.” Fifteen minutes later, Miss\r\nPollitzer called on Mr. Barrow, who told her that Mr. Mondell had asked\r\nhim to go to New Jersey. In a letter to Miss Paul, Mr. Barrow listed the\r\nobstacles which he found in the way in the big New Jersey battle:\r\n\r\n\r\n    1. The last Republican State platform on which members of the\r\n    legislature were elected, declared for a referendum.\r\n\r\n    2. The Republican State Chairman was an open and avowed\r\n    anti-Suffragist.\r\n\r\n    3. The biggest Republican boss in N. J. was actively hostile to the\r\n    Suffrage movement.\r\n\r\n    4. The biggest Democratic boss of N. J. was actively hostile to the\r\n    Suffrage movement.\r\n\r\n    5. The tremendous political influence exerted through the liquor\r\n    interests was actively and openly working against them.\r\n\r\n\r\nNew Jersey ratified on February 10.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the New Jersey campaign, Betty Gram has a vivacious article\r\nin the _Suffragist_ on March, 1920.\r\n\r\nShe says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Miracles happen sometimes—but the ratification of the Suffrage\r\n    Amendment on February 10th by the New Jersey Legislature was not the\r\n    result of a miracle.\r\n\r\n    Every organizer of the Woman’s Party who had worked in the State\r\n    whispered in my ear, “Don’t try New Jersey—it will never ratify.” It\r\n    was therefore with reluctance that at the bidding of Miss Paul and\r\n    Mrs. J. A. H. Hopkins, New Jersey State Chairman, I invaded the\r\n    territory of the enemy and went to Trenton, where on September 30th\r\n    both the Republican and Democratic State platform committees were\r\n    sitting.\r\n\r\n    Despite all our efforts the Republicans that day in open convention\r\n    under the leadership of Republican State Chairman Edward Caspar\r\n    Stokes, declared in favor of a referendum, though each individual\r\n    who had given a pledge to his constituents to support the Suffrage\r\n    Amendment was left free to do so.\r\n\r\n    In significant contrast to this, the Democrats, holding convention\r\n    just across the street, declared for immediate ratification. This\r\n    was done upon the persistent demand of the Democratic candidate for\r\n    governor, Edward I. Edwards, at the probable cost of the support of\r\n    the most influential Democratic boss in the State, James R. Nugent,\r\n    who in open convention fought the issue bitterly and pledged his\r\n    twelve Essex County Assembly candidates against immediate\r\n    ratification. They ran on that issue.\r\n\r\n    We watched the election returns on November 4th with acute anxiety.\r\n    It was a critical point, for we had much to gain and everything to\r\n    lose. The decision brought joy in one respect. Edwards, a Suffrage\r\n    governor, was victorious, but alas! the result showed that the\r\n    Republicans, who had adopted the referendum plank in their platform,\r\n    had carried the Legislature. They had a majority in the Senate of\r\n    fifteen to six and in the Assembly of thirty-three to\r\n    twenty-seven—and among the twenty-seven Democratic members were the\r\n    twelve Nugent men from Essex.\r\n\r\n    We had only a fighting chance at best—but we set about the task\r\n    resolutely. As usual, the first duty was to obtain an authentic\r\n    report of the position of each newly elected man. We had secured\r\n    pre-primary pledges from the fifteen Edwards Democrats, as well as a\r\n    few from some staunch Suffragists on the Republican side, but only a\r\n    very few, for not only was their State Chairman opposed, but the\r\n    Republican boss of South Jersey—former Senator Davis Baird, whom we\r\n    knew would fight us to the end—through his tremendous influence.\r\n\r\n    In a few days our poll was completed. The Senate showed a bare but\r\n    safe majority of one, for there we needed eleven votes. In the House\r\n    our poll was much less encouraging. We needed thirty-one votes out\r\n    of sixty—and we could count only twenty-five positive yeas. Where\r\n    and how to get the six more supporters out of a Republican\r\n    opposition was the bewildering—almost stupefying question. Political\r\n    pressure—both national and local—was the one way out. The time had\r\n    passed for meetings at which to arouse sentiment of\r\n    constituents—only pressure of the most intimate nature would move a\r\n    vote to our side.\r\n\r\n    We first set about to choose our leaders in the respective houses.\r\n    We wanted wide-awake, active militants—parliamentarians who would\r\n    not demand the assurance of the usual excess number of votes before\r\n    moving; men who would take up the fight eagerly, revel in the chance\r\n    of victory, and with odds against them enter enthusiastically into a\r\n    neck to neck race.\r\n\r\n    At a dinner given by the National Woman’s Party at Newark on\r\n    December 10th we accomplished our purpose—Senator Wm. B. MacKay,\r\n    Republican, made an impassioned speech, publicly accepting the\r\n    responsibility of leading our forces in the upper House. At this\r\n    same dinner the newly chosen speaker-elect of the Assembly, W.\r\n    Irving Glover, Republican, pledged his unequivocal support and\r\n    straightforwardly stated that he would do all in his power to bring\r\n    New Jersey into the line of ratified States. The happiest moment of\r\n    the evening arrived when Republican majority leader of the House,\r\n    Harry Hershfield, made known his position on the Suffrage issue and\r\n    expressed his desire that New Jersey ratify. Great applause greeted\r\n    his words that the backbone of opposition had been broken and that\r\n    he anticipated victory and would exert every influence to that end.\r\n    The day after the dinner, Mr. Hershfield permitted to be given out\r\n    from our Headquarters a statement declaring that he would lead the\r\n    fight in the House.\r\n\r\n    The next day I went to Washington. The interest of the two United\r\n    States Senators from New Jersey as well as the Congressmen had to be\r\n    recruited. Soon letters and telegrams were pouring into the State\r\n    from Washington. The resolution passed unanimously by the Republican\r\n    National Committee in Washington on December 10th did much to\r\n    strengthen our position and before long the importance of the issue\r\n    from a national standpoint began to dawn on the vision of some New\r\n    Jersey Republicans.\r\n\r\n    The situation took on a more hopeful aspect—a few finishing touches\r\n    only were needed—but just whose magic touch to summon was the\r\n    problem.\r\n\r\n    We were at a standstill. Two votes were still needed to reach the\r\n    required thirty-one. Then something happened.\r\n\r\n    Inauguration day came and with it the tactical error of the\r\n    opposition which acted as a boomerang and assured the House majority\r\n    leader his position as head of his party. It gave into our hands the\r\n    strategic parliamentary advantage—which we had coveted and desired\r\n    for so long. An unexpected resolution calling for a referendum on\r\n    all constitutional amendments, including pending ones, wedged in\r\n    among routine measures, was surreptitiously introduced on\r\n    Inauguration Day by Assemblyman Coles of Camden and by a viva voce\r\n    vote passed before more than fifteen members knew what had happened.\r\n    Twelve Nugent men from Essex and three Baird men from Camden were\r\n    responsible for the railroading through of this resolution. This act\r\n    of course was a planned and deliberately malicious thrust at\r\n    Suffrage.\r\n\r\n    The House adjourned and the anti-Suffragists believe they had scored\r\n    a point. The reckoning came later. Editorials appeared in papers all\r\n    over the State denouncing such methods. On the following Monday the\r\n    House reconsidered the Coles’ resolution with a vote of forty-four\r\n    to thirteen—and we proceeded with our fight. The ratification\r\n    resolution was introduced immediately after and sent to the Federal\r\n    Relations Committee, which was favorable to our measure—four to one.\r\n    The referendum resolution had gone to the same committee.\r\n\r\n    Then the problem came of getting our resolution reported out first.\r\n    We did not have a sufficient number of votes to hazard the chance of\r\n    having the referendum resolution considered before ours, though some\r\n    of our supporters preferred this procedure. A conference of leaders\r\n    was called, to which I summoned Miss Paul, for the political leaders\r\n    had had little comparative experience in handling constitutional\r\n    amendments, while she had sponsored ratification in two dozen\r\n    States.\r\n\r\n    A hearing before the committee was held on February 2nd. Our State\r\n    Chairman, Mrs. Hopkins, and United States Senator Selden Spencer of\r\n    Missouri, who came from Washington, made splendid appeals for\r\n    Suffrage. That evening our resolution passed the Senate eighteen to\r\n    two as a result of the Republicans having caucused in its support,\r\n    after an appeal had been made to them to do so by Senator Spencer.\r\n    There was no dissenting Democratic vote in the upper House. That\r\n    same evening the House rejected the minority report of the Committee\r\n    and accepted the favorable majority report on our measure. It was\r\n    voted to a second reading and made the first order of business for\r\n    Monday evening, February 9th.\r\n\r\n    That same week influenza seized various members of the Legislature\r\n    and four of our most ardent supporters were ill. Their absence meant\r\n    defeat. Every day we anxiously inquired after their welfare. For a\r\n    time it seemed we would never have our thirty-one yeas together.\r\n\r\n    The day before the vote the National Republican Senatorial and\r\n    Congressional committees sent a representative, Mr. Frank Barrow,\r\n    from Washington to our aid. He worked with the doubtful Republican\r\n    members.\r\n\r\n    At last the long looked-for moment arrived. At eight o’clock on\r\n    Monday evening the Legislature which was either to reject or accept\r\n    the ratification resolution convened.\r\n\r\n    The fight began with opposing men as aggressors and soon one\r\n    resolution after another was being rushed to the speaker’s desk as a\r\n    subterfuge of delay. Roll calls were asked on each and every\r\n    occasion, and as we strained our ears for the yeas and nays we\r\n    received each time a shock at the transference of a vote. A roll\r\n    call to postpone lacked only one of the necessary thirty-one votes.\r\n\r\n    Debate lasted until one o’clock Tuesday morning—five hours of\r\n    continuous fiery combat—and then a motion to move the previous\r\n    question fell like a pall on the troubled assembly. With trembling,\r\n    tired hands we turned to our last spotless roll call and began to\r\n    mark the records of men on the sands of time. Clear and decisive\r\n    came the yeas—inaudible and slow came the nays, and after them all\r\n    the called, “Joint resolution number one adopted—thirty-four to\r\n    twenty-four.”\r\n\r\n    Silence followed for long seconds and then the wild, almost hysteric\r\n    cheers of women reverberated through the halls. Never had there been\r\n    such a demonstration of joy in the New Jersey Capitol and out of the\r\n    galleries poured countless smiling women—bearing banners of victory,\r\n    to take their places among the liberated peoples.\r\n\r\n\r\nIdaho, which ratified on February 11; Arizona on February 12; New Mexico\r\non February 19; Oklahoma on February 27 did so only after a struggle,\r\nbut their cases were special only in detail.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, there had been two January defeats, Mississippi and\r\nSouth Carolina; two February defeats, Virginia for the second time, and\r\nMaryland.\r\n\r\nWest Virginia, which came into the fold on March 10, presents to\r\nratification another dramatic story. I quote an article by Mary Dubrow,\r\nin the April _Suffragist_.\r\n\r\n\r\n    They are all true—the old adages about pride and falls, boasters who\r\n    forget to rap on wood, chickens and hatchings—West Virginia proved\r\n    it.\r\n\r\n    Last August the card catalogue files carefully compiled by Maud\r\n    Younger, Legislative Chairman of the Woman’s Party, showed an\r\n    overwhelming majority for ratification in the West Virginia\r\n    legislature. To check up on this poll, a member of the Legislature\r\n    took another and discovered the same overwhelming majority. Our\r\n    National Headquarters kept in touch with the situation until the\r\n    special session was called.\r\n\r\n    The West Virginia delegation in Congress, the Democratic governor of\r\n    the State, and the Republican National Committee-man, all alike\r\n    expressed certainty of ratification.\r\n\r\n    As I left for West Virginia I confided to every one I met how happy\r\n    I was to go to a State which would probably ratify unanimously, and\r\n    every leading citizen I interviewed for the first four days\r\n    confirmed my expectation.\r\n\r\n    Then the legislators began to assemble at the Kanawha Hotel, the\r\n    political center of Charleston. I had their written pledges and I\r\n    approached them more to exchange pleasant anticipations of victory\r\n    than for any other purpose, and my fall began—a gradual inch-by-inch\r\n    fall. The first man I met said: “Well, I haven’t been here very long\r\n    and I don’t know just how I will vote. You see our great State voted\r\n    Suffrage down by a majority of——” And the second man said the same\r\n    thing, and the third repeated the remark.\r\n\r\n    Then the splendid men who were leading our fight and who were\r\n    standing staunch came to me with appalling reports of the wavering\r\n    of this one and that one. It was an opposition stampede—nothing\r\n    less.\r\n\r\n    I hurriedly told the Washington Headquarters the situation and the\r\n    National Republican Senatorial Committee was prevailed upon to send\r\n    a representative, Mr. Frank Barrow, to West Virginia to urge the\r\n    Republicans in the Legislature to remember their Party and vote for\r\n    ratification.\r\n\r\n    Our chairman in West Virginia, Mrs. William Gay Brown, a staunch\r\n    Democrat, conferred with the Democrats and made them appreciate\r\n    their responsibility. Miss Anita Pollitzer, legislative secretary of\r\n    the Woman’s Party working in Washington, convinced Senator\r\n    Sutherland that his State could not afford to defeat the Amendment.\r\n\r\n    We re-polled the House of Delegates and one hour before the vote was\r\n    taken in that body on March 4 we knew we had forty votes and the\r\n    opposition had forty-one, and that there were six members who would\r\n    tell neither friend, enemy, nor Party leader how they stood—the\r\n    silent six they were called.\r\n\r\n    In the Senate we were certain of fourteen both ways. But the\r\n    Republican leaders were sure they could get one more. Some of them\r\n    were even sure they could get three! Senator Harmer, who led the\r\n    fight in the Senate and who is one of the best parliamentarians in\r\n    the State, nevertheless was not for allowing ratification to come to\r\n    a vote.\r\n\r\n    The vote was taken—and the clerk announced it—“fourteen to\r\n    fourteen.” Senator Harmer saved the situation by changing his vote\r\n    and making reconsideration possible. The Senate adjourned. It was\r\n    the turn of the House. When the debate began speeches were tossed\r\n    from man to man like balls in a game, and never for four hours was\r\n    there a moment of silence in the House. At six o’clock the vote was\r\n    taken. Forty-six men, in the face of the action of the Senate, stood\r\n    sound—not as Republicans, not as Democrats, but as Suffragists,\r\n    every one of the silent six voting for us.\r\n\r\n    With the announcement of the tie in the Senate, national leaders who\r\n    had paid no attention to our repeated warnings of peril sprang into\r\n    action. Representative Fess, Chairman of the Republican\r\n    Congressional Committee, immediately wired the following telegram to\r\n    Republicans:\r\n\r\n    “Can not overestimate importance from Party standpoint of Republican\r\n    legislature West Virginia ratification and desire to maintain this\r\n    position. Any attempt substitute referendum would be grave mistake.\r\n    Can we count on your active and immediate aid?”\r\n\r\n    Senator Poindexter, Chairman of the Republican Senatorial Committee,\r\n    told of the situation by leaders in Washington, sent the following\r\n    message:\r\n\r\n    “Republican Senatorial Committee is deeply concerned over result of\r\n    Suffrage vote in your Senate. We count on West Virginia’s\r\n    ratification. Republican Party has pioneered every fight for\r\n    Suffrage and every State where Republicans had control of the\r\n    Legislature has ratified. Party will be greatly embarrassed if West\r\n    Virginia breaks that most gratifying record through failure to\r\n    co-operate with us in this critical time.”\r\n\r\n    Senator Capper and Senator Kendrick likewise sent messages urging\r\n    the Republicans to reconsider this fatal step.\r\n\r\n    Senator Owen, Senator Walsh, and Attorney General Palmer, Secretary\r\n    Daniels and Secretary Baker all used every effort to make it a\r\n    Democratic victory.\r\n\r\n    As a climax to all this, the President himself, realizing that one\r\n    Democratic vote could save the situation, sent every opposed\r\n    Democratic member of the Senate a telegram urging him to cast the\r\n    deciding vote. If we could not obtain one vote from this pressure,\r\n    there was only one chance left to us.\r\n\r\n    Senator Bloch, who was wintering in California, had asked to be\r\n    paired for Suffrage. The opposition refused to consider his request\r\n    and no pressure could obtain from the opposed Senators this ordinary\r\n    Senatorial courtesy. A long-distance call was put in for Senator\r\n    Bloch in San Francisco. That night he started east.\r\n\r\n    Now came the test of all our resources and of the loyalty of our\r\n    friends, and I do not believe that any stauncher loyalty has been\r\n    displayed by any group of men in the whole ratification campaign\r\n    than by the fourteen Suffrage senators of the West Virginia\r\n    Legislature.\r\n\r\n    For five days these fourteen men had to wait in Charleston while the\r\n    fifteenth vote crossed the continent. Every day they held\r\n    conferences and buoyed one another up, while Betty Gram, who had\r\n    been sent from Washington to help in the campaign, and I hovered\r\n    round about trying, with radiant cheerfulness, to instill into every\r\n    one the feeling: “Senator Block is on his way and all is well with\r\n    the world.” Telegraphic despatches constantly arrived saying Senator\r\n    Block was in New Mexico or Omaha or some other remote place that\r\n    gradually grew nearer.\r\n\r\n    Our enemies once more began their attack in the House. The\r\n    opposition tried to reconsider and were beaten; tried a referendum\r\n    and were beaten; tried to prevent consideration from being tabled\r\n    and were beaten. Nevertheless, all of the delegates of the lower\r\n    House had to be held in Charleston as well as the Senators. One man\r\n    got as far as his comfortable seat in the train, but we heard that\r\n    he had bought a ticket. I took a taxicab, Miss Gram and Mrs.\r\n    Puffenbarger, Chairman of the Woman’s Committee of West Virginia,\r\n    took another. We arrived simultaneously and that bewildered delegate\r\n    was rushed off the train and back to his less comfortable seat in\r\n    the Capitol.\r\n\r\n    At one time it looked as if we could not get enough votes to recess\r\n    from day to day until Senator Bloch arrived, and our friends\r\n    prepared for continuous session. They carried pillows in their hands\r\n    and playing-cards in their pockets, and we on the outside had our\r\n    arrangements made for relaying them sandwiches and coffee. It was\r\n    the opposition that weakened in the face of this ordeal.\r\n\r\n    Then came Monday, the day set for Mr. Bloch’s arrival and suddenly a\r\n    senator disappeared. We thought that he had been abducted. His\r\n    thirteen Suffrage colleagues rushed about searching for him. Miss\r\n    Gram and I walked the streets, even daring to peer into barber-shop\r\n    windows.\r\n\r\n    At last the mystery was solved. He had gone home and was delayed by\r\n    a blizzard.\r\n\r\n    The Senate did not convene until he reappeared at 2:50 and saved the\r\n    situation.\r\n\r\n    And then Senator Bloch arrived—one man alone in two coaches bouncing\r\n    behind an engine that broke the world record for speed. He had\r\n    chosen the special train rather than the airplane that was put at\r\n    his disposal by the Republicans, but, as he said himself, he was\r\n    traveling in the air most of the way to Charleston. As he got off\r\n    the train, pale but smiling, he was grasping his golf sticks\r\n    desperately in one hand and a thermos bottle of coffee in the other.\r\n    And at 2:40 A.M., when his private train pulled in, the town was out\r\n    to meet him.\r\n\r\n    While the senator tried to catch his breath, he gave this statement\r\n    to the press:\r\n\r\n    “The fourteen men who have so splendidly held together until my\r\n    arrival deserve all the credit for the victory which we hope to gain\r\n    tomorrow.”\r\n\r\n    Even then our victory was won as by a miracle, for while we brought\r\n    our vote from California, the anti-Suffragists were also bringing a\r\n    senator more quietly from Peoria, Ill. Senator Montgomery, who had\r\n    moved out of the State and resigned from the Senate, was persuaded\r\n    to come back and attempt to regain his seat. But one of the\r\n    opposition whom it had happened by chance Senator Montgomery had\r\n    told personally of his resignation, refused to dishonor himself by\r\n    voting to reseat even a member of his own Party under these\r\n    conditions, and the day was saved again for the women of America.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last Western State—Washington—ratified on March 22.\r\n\r\nThirty-five States had now accepted the Susan B. Anthony Amendment. One\r\nmore and it would become part of the Constitution. However, that last\r\nState, every one knew, would be hard to get. The chances looked\r\nbrightest in Delaware and the Woman’s Party concentrated all its\r\nenergies there.\r\n\r\nRatification was brought up twice in Delaware, the first time on April 1\r\nand the second time on May 5. The fight was an intensive one, but it\r\nfailed. This campaign had a quality of picturesqueness given to it by\r\nits _mise en scene_—the open square where the State House stands. Dover\r\nGreen is surrounded by charming colonial houses with a beautiful\r\ncolonial Capitol dominating them. Here, when the news came from\r\nPhiladelphia of the signing of the Declaration of Independence, a crowd\r\nburned the picture of King George—“Compelled by strong necessity, thus\r\nwe destroy even the shadow of that King who refused to reign over a free\r\npeople.” The ancient whipping-post still stands in a yard adjoining the\r\nState House. A log cabin, which was put up fifty years ago, is still\r\nused as a lawyer’s office. The _Suffragist_ noted the fact that a yoke\r\nof oxen, drawing a plow in the ancient way, had been seen near Dover\r\nwhen the ratification campaign was going on. This accumulation of\r\nhistoric atmosphere added its subtle weight to the regret of the\r\nSuffragists when Delaware failed them.\r\n\r\nAgainst highly organized opposition, the Suffragists began work in\r\nDelaware. Florence Bayard Hilles, State Chairman, conducted this\r\nimportant fight. She had the assistance of six national organizers: Mary\r\nDubrow, Anita Pollitzer, Catherine Flanagan, Betty Gram, Vivian Pierce,\r\nElsie Hill; of Mrs. Lawrence Lewis, National Ratification Chairman; of\r\nMabel Vernon, National Secretary of the Woman’s Party. Ultimately Alice\r\nPaul joined them. This able group produced a triumph of Suffrage\r\nratification in the Senate on May 5. The vote was eleven to six. In the\r\nusual course of events, the ratification measure would have gone, after\r\nthe Senate passed it, to the House. The votes necessary to pass it in\r\nthe House were not forthcoming. The Legislature adjourned.\r\n\r\nThe Woman’s Party used the interval until May 17 when the Legislature\r\nreconvened to wage a campaign against their opponents, by means of\r\npetitions, mass-meetings, and appeals to State leaders. President de\r\nValera, Frank Walsh, and other champions of Irish freedom used their\r\ninfluence with the four Irish members of the Lower House. The American\r\nFederation of Labor also helped in this campaign. On June 2, when it\r\nbecame evident that the Republicans in this strongly Republican\r\nLegislature, would not ratify, President Wilson asked the Democrats to\r\ngive their aid. The President’s telegram ran:\r\n\r\n\r\n    May I not as a Democrat express my deep interest in the Suffrage\r\n    Amendment, and my judgment that it will be of the greatest service\r\n    to the Party if every Democrat in the Delaware Legislature should\r\n    vote for it.\r\n\r\n\r\nDelaware had been the first to ratify the Constitution of the United\r\nStates but it failed to ratify this second great instrument of freedom.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor two months the Delaware members of the Republican Party had delayed\r\nthe ratification of the Amendment. In spite of repeated appeals to them,\r\nthe Republican national leaders refused to give the necessary support to\r\nassure victory in that State.\r\n\r\nOn May 18, Will H. Hays, Chairman of the Republican Party, spoke at the\r\nHotel Willard, Washington, to women especially selected because of their\r\nwealth—in the hope that they would answer an appeal for funds for the\r\nsupport of the Republican Party. As each member of the audience took her\r\nseat, she found on her chair a slip which read in effect, “For the use\r\nof the Republican National Committee, I herewith enclose a check for\r\n$1,000.”\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Hays arose from his seat, Elsie Hill, well known as a national\r\norganizer of the Woman’s Party, arose from hers. As he started to speak,\r\nshe said, “Before you ask us to support the Republican Party, Mr. Hays,\r\nwon’t you tell us what the Republican Party is going to do about\r\nratification in Delaware?”\r\n\r\nThe Chairman immediately intervened. “I am sure Mr. Hays, if he has time\r\nin the course of his remarks, will answer that.” Instantly Sue White,\r\none of the State chairmen, arose and demanded that the question be\r\nanswered at once. Mr. Hays apparently did not hear. He moved to the\r\nfront of the platform, opened his lips to speak. Immediately Benigna\r\nGreen Kalb, a well-known member of the Woman’s Party, arose and said,\r\n“Mr. Hays, women will not give money for the next elections until they\r\nknow whether or not they are going to vote in them. In Delaware,\r\nConnecticut, and Vermont the Republican Party can answer that question.”\r\n\r\nMr. Hays said, “I suppose I may as well take this matter up at once. My\r\ndear ladies, if any one of you know anything whatever about practical\r\npolitics, you would know that we do not carry Legislatures around in our\r\npockets. Why don’t you go to Delaware and work for Suffrage?”\r\n\r\nInstantly Anita Pollitzer was on her feet. “I have been working in\r\nDelaware, Mr. Hays, for six months. The legislators of Delaware seem to\r\nthink that the Republican Party can do something about Suffrage in that\r\nState. Some of the leading Republicans of the Lower House telephoned to\r\nme last night and asked, ‘What are the national Republican leaders going\r\nto do about this deadlock here?’”\r\n\r\nMr. Hays attempted explanation; apology; prophecy. “Every Republican\r\nhopes that Delaware will ratify. Some one of the remaining States will\r\nbe intelligent enough to act between now and election time. I feel sure\r\nwomen will vote in the next elections.”\r\n\r\nAbby Scott Baker interposed, “Mr. Hays, why are you sure women will vote\r\nin the next elections? If the Republican Party cannot persuade the\r\nRepublican Legislature of Delaware to ratify, can it persuade the\r\nRepublican governors of Connecticut and Vermont to call special\r\nsessions, or are you depending upon the Democratic States to enfranchise\r\nthe women to whom your Party is now appealing for funds?”\r\n\r\nWoman after woman arose and brought up the matter of Delaware. Mr. Hays’\r\nspeech was rapidly disappearing before the onslaught. He had spoken on\r\nnothing but Suffrage. Many of the audience liked the interruptions no\r\nbetter than Mr. Hays. They groaned and hissed. But the Suffragists kept\r\non. Edith Ainge spoke. Elsie Hill arose for a second time and a third.\r\nFinally, definitely enraged, Mr. Hays accused her of being a Democratic\r\nwoman who had come to interrupt his meeting. Miss Hill replied, “My\r\nfather was for twenty years Republican Congressman from Connecticut and\r\nfor several years ranking member of the Ways and Means Committee.”\r\n\r\nMr. Hays talked for nearly five minutes after this last interruption. He\r\nslid off the subject of Delaware. He progressed as far away as Abraham\r\nLincoln. Lucy Branham arose to bring his mind back to Delaware. Mr. Hays\r\nwas saying, “The great Republican leaders of the past——” and his hands\r\nwere uplifted to emphasize his statement. Glancing down between them,\r\nhis gaze was attracted by Miss Branham’s movement. “Not now, young lady,\r\nnot now,” he commanded, or suggested, or perhaps begged. Miss Branham\r\nbore up the aisle. Neither Mr. Hays’ gesture nor sentence completed\r\nitself. “In conclusion,” he said, “I desire to state that the few women\r\nwho are about to be enfranchised could do no better——” Mr. Hays’\r\nconclusion merged with air.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the anti-Suffragists in Ohio had brought a suit\r\nattacking the validity of the Ohio ratification on the ground that the\r\nState of Ohio had the initiative and referendum on all acts by the State\r\nLegislature and therefore must have it on ratification, if it were\r\ndemanded by petition. They therefore demanded a referendum on the\r\nratification of Suffrage. The Woman’s Party contested this suit,\r\nengaging the following counsel: Shippen Lewis, George Wharton Pepper,\r\nand William Draper Lewis. It went through the Courts of Ohio to the\r\nSupreme Court of the United States, which sustained the validity of the\r\nOhio ratification.\r\n\r\nThe Republican Convention began on June 8 in Chicago. Delaware—whose\r\nLegislature and Governor were Republican—had just-defeated ratification.\r\nThere were only two other States from which it seemed possible at this\r\ntime to obtain final ratification—Vermont and Connecticut. There were,\r\nto be sure, two other States which had not acted on the\r\nAmendment—Florida and Tennessee. But there were clauses in their\r\nconstitutions which provided that an election must occur between the\r\nsubmission of an Amendment and its ratification. The fact that both\r\nVermont and Connecticut were Republican put the responsibility of\r\nfinishing up ratification on the Republicans. As repeated appeals to the\r\nNational Republican leaders had failed to induce them to bring\r\nsufficient pressure on the Republican governors of Vermont and\r\nConnecticut, the Suffragists felt that it was necessary to make a\r\nstronger protest than hitherto they had exerted against this Republican\r\ninaction. They therefore decided to picket the Republican National\r\nConvention. The first day of the Convention, Mabel Vernon led a long\r\nwhite-clad line of women, carrying lettered banners and the purple,\r\nwhite, and gold tri-color, from the Woman’s Party Headquarters to the\r\nColiseum, directly opposite, where the Convention was held. They marched\r\nacross the street and took up their brilliant tri-color stand at\r\nintervals against its dull walls.\r\n\r\nMary Ingham bore a banner which said:\r\n\r\n           THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS THE POWER TO ENFRANCHISE\r\n                       WOMEN. WHEN WILL IT DO SO?\r\n\r\nDoris Stevens’ banner read:\r\n\r\n                    WE HAVE HAD ENOUGH RESOLUTIONS.\r\n                        GIVE US THE 36TH STATE.\r\n\r\nMrs. H. O. Havemeyer’s banner said:\r\n\r\n              THEODORE ROOSEVELT ADVOCATED WOMAN SUFFRAGE.\r\n                 HAS THE REPUBLICAN PARTY FORGOTTEN THE\r\n                   PRINCIPLES OF THEODORE ROOSEVELT?\r\n\r\nMrs. M. Toscan Bennett’s banner said:\r\n\r\n           WE PROTEST AGAINST THE CONTINUED DISFRANCHISEMENT\r\n                   OF WOMEN FOR WHICH THE REPUBLICAN\r\n                       PARTY IS NOW RESPONSIBLE.\r\n\r\n             THE REPUBLICAN PARTY DEFEATED RATIFICATION OF\r\n                         SUFFRAGE IN DELAWARE.\r\n\r\n              THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS BLOCKING SUFFRAGE IN\r\n                                VERMONT.\r\n\r\n              THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS BLOCKING SUFFRAGE IN\r\n                              CONNECTICUT.\r\n\r\n              WHEN WILL THE REPUBLICAN PARTY STOP BLOCKING\r\n                               SUFFRAGE?\r\n\r\nThis banner was also carried by Catherine Flanagan and Lou Daniels.\r\n\r\nThese banners were held during the first two days of the Convention. On\r\nthe third day, each of thirty women carried a new banner:\r\n\r\n               VOTE AGAINST THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AS LONG\r\n                         AS IT BLOCKS SUFFRAGE.\r\n\r\nThis quotation from Susan B. Anthony also appeared on the picket line:\r\n\r\n          NO SELF-RESPECTING WOMAN SHOULD WISH OR WORK FOR THE\r\n                SUCCESS OF A PARTY THAT IGNORES HER SEX.\r\n                       —Susan B. Anthony in 1872 and 1894.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE OLDEST AND THE YOUNGEST PICKETS. Rev. Olympia Brown\r\nand Miss Rowena Green at the Republican Convention, Chicago, 1920.\r\nPhoto Copr. Underwood and Underwood.]\r\n\r\n\r\nA favorite banner was:\r\n\r\n                        REPUBLICANS WE ARE HERE.\r\n                        WHERE IS THE 36TH STATE?\r\n\r\nThese banners were typical; many others appeared.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of the Convention the Republicans inserted the\r\nfollowing plank in their platform:\r\n\r\n\r\n    We welcome women into full participation in the affairs of\r\n    government and the activities of the Republican Party. We earnestly\r\n    hope that Republican legislatures in States which have not yet acted\r\n    upon the Suffrage Amendment will ratify the Amendment to the end\r\n    that all of the women of the nation of voting age may participate in\r\n    the election of 1920, which is so important to the welfare of our\r\n    country.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the last day, therefore, a group of pickets hung, from the balcony in\r\nthe Convention hall, facing the speakers platform, a banner which was\r\nthe answer to this ratification plank. It read:\r\n\r\n             WHY DOES THE REPUBLICAN PARTY BLOCK SUFFRAGE?\r\n\r\n                         WE DO NOT WANT PLANKS.\r\n\r\n                       WE DEMAND THE 36TH STATE.\r\n\r\nThe effect of all this was that instant and urgent pressure to call\r\nspecial sessions was brought on the Republican governors of Vermont and\r\nConnecticut by Republican leaders.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to the treatment which the police of Washington, Boston, and\r\nNew York had accorded the pickets, the police of Chicago were friendly\r\nand accommodating. Sometimes they even held the banners for them.\r\n\r\nImmediately following the nomination of Senator Harding, members of the\r\nWoman’s Party met him in Washington in an interview arranged by\r\nGenevieve Allen. Miss Paul introduced Mrs. Albion Lang, Helena Hill\r\nWeed, and Florence Bayard Hilles, each representing one of the three\r\nRepublican States which had not acted favorably on ratification; Mrs.\r\nJohn Carey, Helen Hoy Greeley, Emma Wold and Genevieve Allen,\r\nrepresenting women who could vote, and Sue White, Mary Ingham, Mrs. John\r\nGordon Battelle, Mrs. Donald R. Hooker, representing women who could not\r\nvote. The interview was utterly unsatisfactory—Senator Harding listened\r\nand evaded.\r\n\r\nOn June 15, Louisiana, which met in regular session, defeated\r\nratification. Here, anticipating a little, it may be stated that on\r\nAugust 19, North Carolina defeated ratification, also in regular\r\nsession.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the Woman’s Party turned its attention to Tennessee. Up\r\nto this time, it had been considered impossible to ratify there, as\r\nthere is a clause in the Tennessee State Constitution which says that\r\nthe Tennessee Legislature cannot act on any Amendment to the Federal\r\nConstitution unless a new Legislature is elected between the time when\r\nthe Federal Amendment shall have passed Congress and its ratification by\r\nTennessee. The decision in the Ohio case which was handed down at this\r\nmoment and which indicated that both Tennessee and Florida could ratify\r\nlegally, changed the whole complexion of the Suffrage fight. The Ohio\r\ndecision, it will be remembered, was that ratification was an act of a\r\nLegislature which was not subject to a referendum to the people. The\r\nWoman’s Party pointed out—and they had consulted many eminent lawyers on\r\nthis subject—that the clause in the Tennessee Constitution was equal to\r\nrequiring a referendum before submitting a constitutional amendment to\r\nthe Legislature. Since by the Ohio decision a referendum on such a\r\nmatter was illegal, that clause in the Tennessee constitution could not\r\nstand in the way of ratification by the existing Legislature. Sue White,\r\nTennessee State Chairman, instituted an immediate campaign on Governor\r\nRoberts, pointing this out to him and asking him to call a special\r\nsession. The Woman’s Party concentrated on getting the National\r\nDemocratic leaders to bring pressure on Governor Roberts.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, leading Democrats had gathered in San Francisco,\r\npreparing for their National Convention. Abby Scott Baker took charge of\r\nthe campaign to get the Democratic leaders to bring pressure on the\r\nGovernor of Tennessee. The Democratic National Committee passed a\r\nresolution calling on the Governor to convene his session. Homer S.\r\nCummings, Chairman of the National Democratic Committee, called him on\r\nlong-distance telephone and asked this of him. Many others appealed to\r\nhim. On June 23, President Wilson telegraphed Governor Roberts as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    It would be a real service to the Party and to the Nation if it is\r\n    possible for you to, under the peculiar provisions of your State\r\n    Constitution, having in mind the recent decision of the Supreme\r\n    Court in the Ohio case, to call a special session of the Legislature\r\n    of Tennessee to consider the Suffrage Amendment. Allow me to urge\r\n    this very earnestly.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe President also sent a letter to acting United States Attorney\r\nGeneral William L. Frierson, asking his opinion on the constitutionality\r\nof ratification by a special session of the Tennessee Legislature.\r\n\r\nMr. Frierson’s reply closed with this sentence:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I am therefore confident that if the Tennessee Legislature is called\r\n    in session, it will have the clear power to ratify the Amendment\r\n    notwithstanding any provision of the Tennessee Constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Democratic National Convention met in San Francisco on June 28. On\r\nthe opening day of the Convention, Governor Roberts announced that he\r\nwould call the session on August 9. Among the women who represented the\r\nWoman’s Party at the Convention were Abby Scott Baker, Betty Gram, Mrs.\r\nLawrence Lewis, Mrs. William Kent, Sara Bard Field, Ida Finney\r\nMackrille, Izetta Jewel Brown. The Democratic Party inserted a plank in\r\ntheir platform endorsing the Federal Amendment and calling for\r\nratification.\r\n\r\nTennessee then became the center of the Woman’s Party campaign—a storm\r\ncenter. It was a foregone conclusion that a tremendous anti-Suffrage\r\npressure would be brought on Tennessee, the last State necessary to\r\nratification, as it had been brought on Delaware when Delaware seemed\r\nlikely to be the last State. Alice Paul realized that great national\r\npolitical pressure must be brought upon the Tennessee legislators.\r\n\r\nGovernor Cox, the Democratic nominee, was, of course, a focus for most\r\nof this political pressure. The Woman’s Party determined to make him\r\nrealize, if possible, that Tennessee, as a Democratic State, was his\r\nresponsibility. A huge deputation of Woman’s Party leaders from all over\r\nthe country called upon Governor Cox in his office in Columbus on July\r\n16. Governor Cox said that he would co-operate with the Woman’s Party in\r\nthis matter and he asked to have a committee appointed to confer with\r\nhim in regard to Tennessee. The Democratic National Committee met on\r\nJuly 20. The Woman’s Party lobbied this Committee and got a resolution\r\nthrough urging immediate ratification by Tennessee. On July 23, Governor\r\nCox conferred with the Committee—consisting of Sue White, Anita\r\nPollitzer, and Mrs. James Rector—which he had asked Miss Paul to\r\nappoint.\r\n\r\nThe Republican National Committee met on July 21. Anita Pollitzer, Mrs.\r\nH. O. Havemeyer, Mrs. James Rector, and others saw the members of this\r\nCommittee and secured from them a resolution urging that the Republicans\r\ndo all they could to obtain the last State.\r\n\r\nOn July 22, the date of Harding’s notification that he was nominated for\r\nthe Presidency, two hundred members of the Woman’s Party, coming from\r\nall over the United States, dressed in white and carrying purple, white\r\nand gold banners, marched through Marion to Senator Harding’s lawn. The\r\nlettered banners, borne by two pioneer Suffragists, Mrs. L. Crozier\r\nFrench and Mrs. E. C. Green, read:\r\n\r\n       THE REPUBLICAN PLATFORM ENDORSES RATIFICATION OF SUFFRAGE.\r\n\r\n           THE FIRST TEST OF THE PLATFORM WILL COME WHEN THE\r\n                 TENNESSEE LEGISLATURE MEETS IN AUGUST.\r\n\r\n        WILL THE REPUBLICANS CARRY OUT THEIR PLATFORM BY GIVING\r\n         A UNANIMOUS REPUBLICAN VOTE IN TENNESSEE FOR SUFFRAGE?\r\n\r\nMrs. John Gordon Battelle, Sue White, Mrs. H. O. Havemeyer, addressed\r\nSenator Harding and told him that he, as the Republican leader, had the\r\npower to line up the Republican members of the Tennessee Legislature and\r\nwould be held responsible for them.\r\n\r\nAll this time the campaign in Tennessee had been going on.\r\n\r\nThat campaign, which was to become fiercer and more intensive until it\r\nmoved like a whirlwind, was conducted in three ways.\r\n\r\nFirst, Sue White, the State Chairman and other members of the State\r\norganization, assisted by Betty Gram, Catherine Flanagan and Anita\r\nPollitzer, national organizers, conducted the campaign. After the\r\nLegislature convened Mrs. Florence Bayard Hilles, Delaware State\r\nChairman, and Mary Winsor, of the Advisory Council, assisted in\r\nNashville. Mabel Reber and Edith Davis carried on an extensive and\r\nintensive work of publicity.\r\n\r\nSecond, in Ohio, Abby Scott Baker, co-operating with Mrs. James Rector,\r\nkept in close touch with Cox and Harding, in order to get them to act\r\nupon the specific requests of the Woman’s Party which began to come from\r\nTennessee.\r\n\r\nThird, Alice Paul remaining in Washington, planned every move, and kept\r\nin close communication with the political leaders who could influence\r\nCox and Harding.\r\n\r\nSue White, immediately on her arrival at Nashville, opened Woman’s Party\r\nHeadquarters and took charge of the campaign on the legislators.\r\n\r\nAnita Pollitzer went to the eastern part of the State and concentrated\r\non the Republican leaders.\r\n\r\nBetty Gram went to the western part of the State and worked in the\r\nSpeaker’s district.\r\n\r\nCatherine Flanagan went into the districts of men soon to be elected,\r\nand secured pledges from some of the nominees that they would support\r\nratification. In one case, Miss Flanagan secured the pledge of a\r\nRepublican candidate whose Democratic opponent was a strong\r\nanti-Suffragist. A prominent Democrat in the district came out in\r\nsupport of the Republican nominee because he was for ratification.\r\n\r\nIf the three organizers had not made this intensive survey of these\r\nsections, they would not have realized that ratification votes were\r\nrapidly dropping away. Legislators gave the excuse that although they\r\nvoted for Presidential Suffrage in a previous session, they would not\r\nvote for ratification in this session because they considered it\r\nunconstitutional. Alarmed at this defection, which was particularly\r\nnoticeable among the Republican legislators, Anita Pollitzer secured\r\nopinions favorable to the constitutionality of ratification by Tennessee\r\nat this special session from the most eminent legal minds in the State,\r\nand sent them to each member of the Legislature.\r\n\r\nAnita Pollitzer also sent a telegram to Abby Scott Baker, who, it will\r\nbe remembered, was standing guard over the two Presidential candidates\r\nin Ohio, stating that the situation demanded Harding’s immediate active\r\nsupport. Mrs. Baker telegraphed Alice Paul that she had seen Harding in\r\nregard to this matter and that he had telegraphed two Republican\r\nCongressmen to give their support to ratification, and his friend,\r\nex-Governor Ben Hooper of Tennessee, to send him a poll of the\r\nRepublicans. Immediately on receipt of a telegram from Alice Paul giving\r\nthis information, Anita Pollitzer hurried to the “hill-billy” region of\r\nthe State, where ex-Governor Hooper lived. Miss Pollitzer went over the\r\nentire situation with him in detail, giving him the only first-hand\r\ninformation that he had received. The result was that he spent the whole\r\nday telephoning the doubtful Republican legislators. He also telegraphed\r\nHarding that the situation was critical and urged him to give all\r\npossible aid to the Tennessee situation.\r\n\r\nMiss Pollitzer then told ex-Governor Hooper that it was absolutely\r\nnecessary to have a Republican caucus. Candler, the Chairman of the\r\nJoint Caucus Committee, was an anti-Suffragist. Congressman J. Will\r\nTaylor had, however, a strong influence with him. Miss Pollitzer started\r\nlate that afternoon for Knoxville, where Congressman Taylor lived, and\r\narriving early in the evening put her case to him. He said that he had\r\nvoted for Suffrage in Congress and would do all he could to help. The\r\nnext afternoon Miss Pollitzer saw Congressman Taylor to see what had\r\nbeen accomplished. He said that he had been unable to get Candler all\r\nday, was leaving the city in an hour. Miss Pollitzer called up the\r\noperator in Athens. She said, “This is a matter of life and death.\r\nCongressman Taylor must speak with Senator Candler. I have been in\r\nAthens myself and I know it is such a tiny place that you have only to\r\nlook out of the door to know where Senator Candler is. You must find him\r\nfor me.” In a few minutes Senator Candler came to the telephone.\r\nCongressman Taylor asked him if he would call a caucus of the\r\nRepublicans, and he agreed to do it. That night Miss Pollitzer took\r\nnotices of this to all the papers. A telegram was sent to every\r\nRepublican member urging him to come to the Legislature in time to\r\nattend this caucus. It was a necessary step to call this caucus, but it\r\nwas equally necessary that all the important Republican leaders of the\r\nState be there. Catherine Flanagan and Anita Pollitzer brought so much\r\npressure to bear on these leaders—and this included getting their\r\nreservations and actually seeing them on the train—that they were all\r\nthere. The Republican leaders said in effect to the Republican members\r\nof the Legislature who were present, “We want the Republican members of\r\nthe Legislature to give a majority of votes to ratification for the sake\r\nof their Party.”\r\n\r\nBefore the Legislature convened, Betty Gram saw the Speaker of the\r\nHouse, Seth Walker, a very influential person and to the Suffragists,\r\nbecause of his position, probably the most important member of the\r\nLegislature. He told Miss Gram that he was looking into the question of\r\nthe constitutionality of ratification at this session, and if he became\r\nconvinced of its constitutionality, he might even lead the fight for\r\nratification. A few days later, just before the Legislature convened, he\r\ntold Miss White and Miss Gram that he had decided that it was\r\nconstitutional for Tennessee to ratify and that they might count on his\r\nsupport. On the opening day of the Legislature, Betty Gram asked Speaker\r\nWalker to go over the poll with her. To her intense astonishment, he\r\ntold her that he had changed his mind and could not vote for\r\nratification in this session.\r\n\r\nWhen the Woman’s Party forces joined Miss White in Nashville at the\r\nconvening of the Legislature, the town had filled with strangers. The\r\nanti-Suffrage forces had poured into the Capital. Lobbyists for\r\nrailroads, manufacturing interests, and corporations of various kinds,\r\ncame too.\r\n\r\nOne curious member of this army used to interrogate legislators as to\r\ntheir views. He said he was a reporter for a syndicate. Nobody had ever\r\nheard of the syndicate he represented. When Parley Christensen,\r\ncandidate for President on the Farmer Labor ticket, came to Nashville to\r\nhelp with ratification among the labor members of the Legislature, he\r\ninvestigated the record of this gentleman, accused him, through the\r\nPress, of sinister purposes in lobbying. When this accusation appeared,\r\nthe man hastily left town.\r\n\r\nTo off-set all this, the Suffragists of the State, as was usual in the\r\nState campaigns, poured into the Capital.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere of Nashville grew rapidly more active ... tense ...\r\nhectic.\r\n\r\nThe Tennessee legislature convened on the ninth of August. It ratified\r\non the eighteenth of August. The nine days between were characterized by\r\nwork more intensive than ratification had yet known.\r\n\r\nThe Tennessee campaign was a miniature reproduction of the big national\r\ncampaign which the Woman’s Party had been waging ever since 1912. Here\r\nthe Woman’s Party was confronted with a double responsibility. It had to\r\nprove to the Democratic governor, Roberts—and it never relaxed for an\r\ninstant in bringing it home to him—that he, as leader of the dominant\r\nParty in this Democratic Legislature, was responsible for ratification\r\nand could bring it about. In addition and at the same time, the Woman’s\r\nParty had to make the Republican minority realize that they were\r\nresponsible for votes favorable to ratification from their men.\r\n\r\nIn all this work in Tennessee, the Woman’s Party was enormously assisted\r\nby the political sagacity of their chairman, Sue White, and the fact\r\nthat all the politicians recognized that political sagacity. The\r\nexperienced politicians said that they had never seen a more bitter\r\nfight in Tennessee. When the Legislature met, the Suffragists had a\r\nmajority on paper. But they knew from previous experience they could not\r\ntrust this paper majority to remain stable.\r\n\r\nThe ratification resolution was introduced in the House and the Senate\r\non the same day, August 10. It was referred to a committee in both\r\nHouses and these committees held a joint hearing on August 11. This\r\nhearing, a notable and picturesque occasion, took place in the great\r\nAssembly Hall of the Capitol. Both floor and gallery were dotted with\r\nthe colors of the opposing forces. The most famous State authorities on\r\nconstitutional law appeared in behalf of the Suffragists.\r\n\r\nThe Woman’s Party had, of course, immediately ascertained who were the\r\nmembers of both Houses who always supported Governor Roberts’ measures.\r\nThey found that many of these were not supporting ratification. They\r\nwent with a list of these men to Governor Roberts, called his attention\r\nto this significant state of things. They also sent the news to Abby\r\nScott Baker, who approached Cox daily on the subject. Cox responded by\r\nurging Governor Roberts to do all in his power to put ratification\r\nthrough.\r\n\r\nSue White gave out daily statements that were models of succinctness and\r\ncomprehensiveness, which warned Governor Roberts that he would be held\r\nresponsible and warned the Democratic Party that it would be held\r\nresponsible, if ratification did not go through.\r\n\r\nRealizing that they were strongest in the Senate, the Woman’s Party\r\nwanted first to bring the matter to a vote there. They accomplished that\r\non August 13, when ratification passed by twenty-five to four. Until\r\nthis vote was cast, the Suffragists themselves did not realize what a\r\ndegree of interest—due to their pressure on and from political\r\nleaders—they had developed in Tennessee. The vote proved a great\r\nstimulus to the men of the Lower House, who, up to this point, had been\r\nmuch more wavering in their attitude towards ratification.\r\n\r\nThe Capitol in these last few days presented a scene of activity on the\r\npart of the Woman’s Party members such as no ratification campaign had\r\never known. They were at the House morning, noon, and night. They had to\r\nbe there all the time because the fact that a member was numbered among\r\ntheir forces in the morning did not at all mean that he would be among\r\nthem at night. The enemies of ratification made every possible attempt\r\nto steal Suffrage adherents. Realizing at last that they could not\r\ndeflect men who were immovable on the ratification side, they began to\r\nintroduce measures the passage of which would have been tantamount to\r\ndefeat. For instance, a resolution was suddenly brought up one morning\r\nproviding that the question of ratification should be referred to\r\nmass-meetings of the people to be held in every district on August 21.\r\nThis would have meant a fatal postponement of ratification. Many of the\r\nlegislators would have liked to hide behind a measure of this sort, but\r\nrealizing this, the Woman’s Party members told them that they would\r\nconsider such a vote hostile to Suffrage and would hold them\r\nresponsible. The Suffragists obtained sufficient support against the\r\nmeasure to get it tabled.\r\n\r\nWhen it came to the last few days, the Woman’s Party members seemed to\r\nwork twenty-four hours out of the twenty-four, and some think they\r\nworked twenty-five. The situation was complicated, as always at the last\r\nhour, by rumors. Reports started and gained force every day that men\r\nwere being bribed; so that legislators, about to declare for Suffrage,\r\nwere often held up by the feeling that that act might lay them open to\r\nsuspicion. This brought about a condition of such uncertainty that\r\nneither side, Suffragist nor anti-Suffragist, could prophesy the\r\noutcome. The instant a man wavered, the Woman’s Party members, who,\r\nbefore the Legislature convened, had been working in the legislative\r\ndistricts, immediately got in touch with the political leaders who\r\ncontrolled the situation in those districts. Notwithstanding that\r\nnothing seemed stable at this period, the Woman’s Party members met\r\nevery few hours and compared polls. These polls served a second purpose.\r\nThey gave political leaders definite data as to the position of every\r\nman in the Legislature. In all this confusion, the Woman’s Party always\r\nknew where it stood.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the vote the Suffrage workers rounded up all their\r\nlegislative forces and saw that they arrived safely at the Capitol. More\r\nrumors were afloat that legislators would change their vote at the last\r\nmoment. In every case, the Woman’s Party saw these men again and made\r\nthem realize that they were committed, not only to them, but to their\r\npolitical leaders.\r\n\r\nJust before the vote was taken, Seth Walker ruled all the women off the\r\nfloor of the House.\r\n\r\nTwo dramatic incidents marked the close of the campaign. The hero of one\r\nof these episodes was Banks Turner, of the other Harry Burn. To the very\r\nend the Woman’s Party was uncertain of both their votes.\r\n\r\nBanks Turner was one of Governor Roberts’ closest friends. In\r\nconsidering the case of Banks Turner, it must always be held in mind\r\nthat the Woman’s Party steadfastly kept the Democrats to their pledges\r\nthrough Cox’s constant pressure on Governor Roberts. It had at last\r\npenetrated Roberts’ psychology that if he permitted ratification to fail\r\nin Tennessee, the Democrats would be held responsible by the women in\r\nthe coming elections. The Woman’s Party saw Governor Roberts before the\r\nvote and reminded him of this. The Woman’s Party also saw Cox before the\r\nvote and reminded him of this; also reminded him to remind Roberts. When\r\nthe vote was actually imminent, the Roberts forces began to get alarmed;\r\nfor they realized they had played with the issue too long. As has been\r\nsaid Banks Turner was one of the Governor’s closest friends. Banks\r\nTurner had never actually said he was against ratification, but he had\r\nnever said he was for it. No Suffragist counted on him.\r\n\r\nAs for Harry Burn——\r\n\r\nWhen Anita Pollitzer had been working among Republican leaders, she had\r\ngone to Harry Burn’s Republican county chairman to ask him if they could\r\ncount on Harry Burn’s support for ratification. In her presence, he\r\ntelephoned to Harry Burn and assured Miss Pollitzer that the Suffragists\r\ncould depend on him. When Mr. Burn appeared in the Legislature, he was\r\napproached by Suffragists and anti-Suffragists in close and quick\r\nsuccession. After a while, he announced that he was uncertain. The fact\r\nthat he was the youngest member of the Legislature—scarcely more than a\r\nlad indeed—and that he was immensely popular and beloved—seemed to add\r\nan especial acuteness to the situation. To Suffragists who approached\r\nhim a few days before the vote, he said, “I cannot pledge myself, but I\r\nwill do nothing to hurt you.”\r\n\r\nOf course that could be translated that he would not vote yes, but would\r\nnot vote no—not vote at all in short.\r\n\r\nWith the poll virtually a tie, the Suffragists could take no chances.\r\nMiss Pollitzer telephoned at once to the county chairman who had assured\r\nher of Harry Burn’s vote and told him the situation. The next day Betty\r\nGram saw a letter, written to Harry Burn by one of the foremost\r\npolitical leaders of the State, which practically urged him—for his own\r\npolitical good—to vote no. Members of the Woman’s Party saw Harry Burn\r\nand told him that they knew pressure was being brought upon him from\r\nState leaders against ratification. He would make no statement of\r\nsupport but he urged them to trust him and begged the Suffragists not to\r\ntell the political leaders of the State that they knew these political\r\nleaders had broken faith and were persuading him not to vote for\r\nratification. He was obviously much wrought up over the situation.\r\n\r\nThe date of the vote came and on the Suffrage poll, Harry Burn was still\r\nmarked doubtful. When he appeared in the corridors of the House,\r\nhowever, he wore the red rose of the anti-Suffragists. One of the\r\nWoman’s Party organizers said to him just before the vote was taken, “We\r\nreally trusted you, Mr. Burn, when you said that you would never hurt\r\nus.” He said, “I mean that—my vote _will_ never hurt you.”\r\n\r\nStill he continued to wear the red rose of the anti-Suffragists....\r\n\r\nIt was known to many that Harry Burn had recently received a letter from\r\nhis mother asking him to support ratification. It was known only to the\r\nWoman’s Party how much political pressure to support it had been brought\r\nupon him.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe supreme moment arrived. Ninety-six members were present out of a\r\ntotal membership of ninety-nine. The first test of strength came in a\r\nmotion to table the Resolution. Harry Burn’s name was called early in\r\nthe roll. True to the promise of that red rose, he voted yes. The roll\r\ncall went on, the members answering exactly according to expectation.\r\nWhat would Banks Turner do? If he voted with the Suffragists, the result\r\nwould be a tie, forty-eight to forty-eight; the motion would not be\r\ntabled. His name was called; he did not answer. The vote was now\r\ninevitably forty-eight to forty-seven for the motion to table. All\r\nseemed lost. But before the final announcement of the vote, Turner arose\r\nand after a moment’s hesitation said:\r\n\r\n“I wish to be recorded as against the motion to table.”\r\n\r\nThe Resolution was still before the House, but this test vote showed a\r\ntie—one short of a majority.\r\n\r\nThen came the final vote.\r\n\r\nNow the stillness was like death. Unless Turner stayed with the\r\nSuffragists and, in addition, another vote was gained, the Amendment was\r\nlost. When Harry Burn’s name was called, he answered in a clear, loud\r\nvoice, “Yes.” The death-like stillness settled again over the audience\r\nin the galleries as the roll call approached the name of Banks Turner.\r\nHe had voted against tabling; that did not make it certain that he would\r\nvote for the Resolution.\r\n\r\n“Banks Turner!” called the clerk.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he answered in a solemn, low voice.\r\n\r\nThe Resolution had carried—forty-nine to forty-seven.\r\n\r\nInstantly Speaker Walker, white-faced, was on his feet. “I change my\r\nvote from ‘No’ to ‘Yes’” he said. Of course he made this lightning\r\nchange in order that he might move to reconsider the Resolution. But he\r\nmissed one point. The vote now stood fifty to forty-six. His vote had\r\ngiven the Resolution a _constitutional majority_, that is a majority,\r\nnot only of the membership present of the Lower House but of the entire\r\nLower House. Unwittingly, Speaker Walker killed one legal attack already\r\nprepared by the anti-Suffragists in case the measure should pass.\r\n\r\nAn uproar of enthusiasm greeted the vote. State leaders who had assisted\r\nthe Suffrage campaign, yelled, clapped, stamped. Women alternately\r\nlaughed and wept; cheered and applauded. One legislator producing a bell\r\nfrom somewhere, rang it steadily. As for the Suffragists themselves,\r\nnaturally they went wild with joy; particularly the Tennessee women, who\r\nwere triumphant that their State had proved to be the needed\r\nthirty-sixth to give the franchise to women.\r\n\r\nOf course, the anti-Suffragist red roses were in great evidence all\r\nduring the voting. But after the vote was taken, they seemed to fade\r\ninto the background. The yellow jonquils of the Suffragists, the great\r\npurple, white, and gold banners of the Woman’s Party made tiny flares\r\nand big slashes of light and color everywhere.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe bizarre and sensational moves of the opposition—the withdrawal of\r\nthe anti-Suffragist members of the Tennessee Assembly to Alabama until\r\nthe Suffrage members got tired and went home, the return of the\r\nanti-Suffragist members, their assembly in a Rump Legislature, their\r\n“reconsidered” vote against the Amendment—all that seemed important at\r\nthe time. Now it has faded to insignificance. The anti-Suffragists, on\r\nthis and other grounds, instituted a suit against the validity of the\r\nTennessee ratification. That suit and six attacks, also directed against\r\nthe validity of ratification, are still pending.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FLAG COMPLETE. Alice Paul Unfurls the Ratification\r\nBanner with 36 Stars.\r\nNational Photo Co., Washington, D. C.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, however, Connecticut has ratified.\r\n\r\nIn brief, the facts in regard to Connecticut are these: Governor Marcus\r\nHolcomb, one of the foremost anti-Suffragists in the country, called a\r\nsession of the Connecticut legislature to provide the legal machinery to\r\nenable the women of Connecticut to vote in the coming elections. The\r\ncall was issued for September 14. The Suffragists instantly took\r\nadvantage of this special session to institute a campaign for\r\nratification.\r\n\r\nIn addressing the legislators, Governor Holcomb said in effect: “Do not\r\nratify this session. It will be illegal, as ratification was not\r\nmentioned in my call. I will call you again for that purpose a week from\r\ntoday.”\r\n\r\nNevertheless Connecticut ratified on September 14.\r\n\r\nCatherine Flanagan of the Woman’s Party personally brought the\r\nratification from the Secretary of State of Connecticut to the State\r\nDepartment in Washington.\r\n\r\nA week later, to avoid any question as to the legality of the first\r\nratification, which had been attacked on the ground that the subject was\r\nnot included in the governor’s message, Connecticut ratified again.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe women of the United States voted in the Presidential election of\r\n1920.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XVII\r\n\r\n                             THE LAST DAYS\r\n\r\n                              TO A COMRADE\r\n\r\n\r\n Oh, you of the unquenchable spirit—\r\n How I adore you!\r\n I could light forever the waning fires of my courage\r\n At the incessant, upleaping flame of your being!\r\n\r\n You,—creature of light and color and vivid emotions—\r\n Of radiant action,—who ever could dream of you passive,\r\n Submissive, your small self stilled into lazy contentment?\r\n You, fired with the beauty of ardor,\r\n Lovely with love for all that is clean and earnest and forceful,\r\n Yourself daring anything\r\n So long as it be for Womanhood, and the cause of justice and progress—\r\n Daring to lead and daring to follow—\r\n Giving us each of your unfailing inspiration.\r\n\r\n You, over whom the jeers and the mockings and the ugly thoughts\r\n   of those who understand not\r\n Pass lightly, like a spent breath of foul air in a still cavern,\r\n Unflicking the steadfast torch of you—\r\n I could re-light forever the waning fires of my courage\r\n At the incessant, upleaping flame of your being!\r\n                     ELIZABETH KALB,\r\n         _The Suffragist_, January 25, 1919.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN 1917 occurred the great leap forward in the activity of the Woman’s\r\nParty; in swift succession came the picketing; the burning of the\r\nPresident’s words; the Watchfires of Freedom. And Headquarters from 1917\r\non—as can be easily imagined—was a feverishly busy place. From the\r\ninstant the picketing started, it grew electric with action. As for the\r\nwork involved in making up the constant succession of picket lines——\r\n\r\nIt was not easy at an instant’s notice to find women who had the time to\r\npicket. But always there were some women willing to picket _part_ of the\r\ntime and some willing to picket _all_ of the time. Mary Gertrude Fendall\r\nwas in charge of this work. That her office was no sinecure is evident\r\nfrom the fact that on one occasion alone—that memorable demonstration of\r\nMarch 4, 1917—she provided a line of nearly a thousand. Of course, too,\r\nas fast as the women went to jail, other women had to be found to fill\r\ntheir places. In those days Miss Fendall lived at the telephone and\r\nbetween telephone calls, she wrote letters which invited sympathizers to\r\ncome from distant States to join the banner-bearing forces. Those women\r\nwho could always be depended on for picketing were, in the main, Party\r\nsympathizers living in Washington; Party workers permanently established\r\nat Headquarters; organizers come back suddenly from their regular work.\r\nBut volunteers came too—volunteers from the District of Columbia and\r\nfrom all parts of the United States. In the winter, as has been before\r\nstated, picketing was a cold business. The women found that they had to\r\nwear a surprising amount of clothes—sweaters and coats, great-coats,\r\nmufflers, arctics and big woolly gloves. Many of the pickets left these\r\nextra things at Headquarters and the scramble to disengage rights and\r\nlefts of the gloves and arctics was one of the amusing details of the\r\noperation of the picket line. Banners took up space too; but they added\r\ntheir cheering color to the picture.\r\n\r\nWhen the arrests began, the atmosphere grew more tense and even more\r\nbusy. But just as—when trouble came—a golden flood poured into the\r\nWoman’s Party treasury, so volunteer pickets came in a steadily\r\nlengthening line. Anne Martin had said to the Judge who sentenced her:\r\n“So long as you send women to jail for asking for freedom, just so long\r\nwill there be women willing to go to jail for such a cause.” This proved\r\nto be true. Volunteers for this gruelling experience continued to appear\r\nfrom all over the country. Mrs. Grey of Colorado, sending her twenty-two\r\nyear old daughter, Nathalie, into the battle, said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I have no son to fight for democracy abroad, and so I send my\r\n    daughter to fight for democracy at home.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt interested many of the Woman’s Party members to study the first\r\nreactions of the police to the strange situation the picketing brought\r\nabout. Most of the policemen did not enjoy maltreating the girls. Some\r\nof them were stupid and a few of them were brutal, but many of them were\r\nkind. They always deferred to Lucy Burns with an air of profound\r\nrespect—Miss Lucy, they called her. But a curious social element entered\r\ninto the situation. Large numbers of the women were well-known\r\nWashingtonians. The police were accustomed to seeing them going about\r\nthe city in the full aura of respected citizenship. It was very\r\ndifficult often, to know—in arresting them—what social tone to adopt.\r\n\r\nMrs. Gilson Gardner tells an amusing story of her first arrest. In the\r\nmidst of her picketing, an officer suddenly stepped up to her. He said\r\npolitely: “It is a very beautiful day.” She concurred. They chatted. He\r\nwas in the meantime looking this way and that up the Avenue. Suddenly,\r\nstill very politely, he said: “I think the patrol will be along\r\npresently.” Not until then did it dawn on Mrs. Gardner that she was\r\narrested.\r\n\r\nLater, when the Watchfires were going, Mrs. Gardner was again arrested\r\nwhile she was putting wood on the flames. There was a log in her arms:\r\n“Just a minute, officer,” she said, in her gentle, compelling voice, and\r\nthe officer actually waited while she crossed the pavement and put the\r\nremaining log on the fire. Later, when Mrs. Gardner’s name was called in\r\nthe court, she decided that she preferred to stand, rather than sit in\r\nthe chair designated for the accused. The policeman started to force her\r\ndown. Again she said, in the gentle, compelling tone: “Please do not\r\ntouch me, officer!” and he kept his hands off her from that time forth.\r\n\r\nOf course, the unthinking made the usual accusation that these women\r\nwere doing all this for notoriety. That was a ridiculous statement,\r\nwhose disproof was easy. The character and quality of the women\r\nthemselves were its best denial. The women who composed the Woman’s\r\nParty were of all kinds and descriptions; they emerged from all ranks\r\nand classes; they came from all over the United States. The Party did\r\nnot belong exclusively to women of great wealth and social position,\r\nalthough there were many such in its list of membership; and some of\r\nthese belonged to families whose fortunes were internationally famous.\r\nIt did not belong exclusively to working women, although there were\r\nthousands of them in its ranks; and these represented almost every\r\nwage-earning task at which women toil. It did not belong exclusively to\r\nwomen of the arts or the professions; although scores of women, many\r\nnationally famous and some internationally famous, lent their gifts to\r\nthe furtherance of the work. It did not belong exclusively to the women\r\nof the home, although scores of wives left homes, filled with the beauty\r\nwhich many generations of cultivation had accumulated—left these homes\r\nand left children; and although equal numbers left homes of a\r\ncontrasting simplicity and humbleness—left these homes and left children\r\nto go to jail in the interests of the movement. It may be said, perhaps,\r\nthat the rank and file were characterized by an influential solidity,\r\nthat they were women, universally respected in their communities,\r\nnecessary to it. It was an all-woman movement. Indeed, often women who\r\non every other possible opinion were as far apart as the two poles,\r\nworked together for the furtherance of the Federal Amendment. On one\r\noccasion, for instance, on the picket line, two women who could not\r\npossibly have found a single intellectual congeniality except the\r\nenfranchisement of women stood side by side. One was nationally and\r\ninternationally famous as a conservative of great fortune. The other was\r\nnationally and internationally famous as a radical. In other words, one\r\nstood at the extreme right of conservatism and the other at the extreme\r\nleft of radicalism. It was as though, among an archipelago of differing\r\nintellectual interests and social convictions, the Party members had\r\nfound one little island on which they could stand in an absolute\r\nunanimity; stand ready to fight—to the death, if it were necessary—for\r\nthat conviction.\r\n\r\nSome of the stories which they tell at Headquarters to illustrate the\r\nPan-woman quality of the Party are touchingly beautiful. There is the\r\ncase, for instance, of a woman government clerk, self-supporting, a\r\nwidow, and the mother of a little girl. Every day for weeks, she had\r\npassed that line of pickets standing silently at the White House gates.\r\nShe heard the insults that were tossed to the women. She saw the\r\nbrutalities which were inflicted on them. She witnessed arrests.\r\nSomething rose within fluttered ... tore at her.... One day when Alice\r\nPaul was picketing, this young woman, suit-case in hand, appeared before\r\nher. She said “I am all ready to picket if you need me. I have made all\r\nthe necessary arrangements in case I am arrested. Where shall I go to\r\njoin your forces so that I may picket today?” She was arrested that\r\nafternoon and sent to prison.\r\n\r\nTwo other government clerks, who appeared on the picket line, were\r\narrested and jailed. They appealed to the government authorities for a\r\nmonth’s leave of absence on the score of their imprisonment. All these\r\nthree women, of course, ran the risk of losing their positions. But in\r\ntheir case the instinct to serve their generation was stronger than the\r\ninstinct to conserve any material safety. It is pleasant to record that\r\nthey were not compelled to make this sacrifice. Others, however,\r\nsuffered. A school teacher in the Woman’s Party, for instance, lost her\r\nposition because of her picketing.\r\n\r\nIf the foregoing is not denial enough of the charge, common when the\r\npicketing began, that these women were notoriety-seeking fanatics,\r\nperhaps nothing will bring conviction. It scarcely seems however that\r\nthe most obstinate antagonist of the Woman’s Party would like to believe\r\nthat delicately reared women could enjoy, even for the sake of\r\nnotoriety—aside from the psychological effect of spiders and cockroaches\r\neverywhere, worms in their food, vermin in their beds, rats in their\r\ncells—the brutalities to which they were submitted. Yet many women who\r\nhad endured this once, came back to endure it again and again.\r\n\r\nOne of the strong points of the Woman’s Party was its fairness. In\r\nreference to the President, for instance, Maud Younger used to say that\r\nthe attitude of the Woman’s Party to him was like that of a girl who\r\nwants a college education. She teases her father for it without\r\ncessation, but she goes on loving him just the same. Another strong\r\npoint of the Woman’s Party was its sense of humor on itself. They tell\r\nwith great delight the amusing events of this period—of the grinning\r\nstreet gamin who stood and read aloud one of the banners, _How long must\r\nwomen wait for liberty?_ and then yelled: “T’ree months yous’ll be\r\nwaitin’—in Occoquan.”—of a reporter who, coming into Headquarters in\r\nsearch of an interview, found a child sliding down the bannisters.\r\nBefore he could speak, the child announced in a tone of proud triumph:\r\n“My mother’s going to prison.”\r\n\r\nA story they particularly like is of that young couple who, having had\r\nno bridal trip at the time of their marriage, came to Washington for a\r\nbelated honeymoon. They visited Headquarters together. The bride became\r\nso interested in the picketing that she went out with one of the picket\r\nlines and was arrested. She spent her belated honeymoon in jail, and the\r\ngroom spent his belated honeymoon indignantly lobbying the Congressmen\r\nof his own district.\r\n\r\nLater, when they were lighting the Watchfires of Freedom on the White\r\nHouse pavement, the activity at Headquarters was increased one\r\nhundred-fold.\r\n\r\nThe pickets themselves refer to that period as the most “messy and\r\nmussy” in their history. Everything and everybody smelled of kerosene.\r\nAll the time, there was one room in which logs were kept soaking in this\r\npervasive fluid. When they first started the Watchfires they carried the\r\nurn and the oil-soaked logs openly, to the appointed spot on the\r\npavement in front of the White House. Later, when the arrests began and\r\nthe fires had to be built so swiftly that they had to abandon the urn,\r\nthey carried these logs under coats or capes. The White House pavement\r\nwas always littered with charred wood even when the Watchfires were not\r\ngoing. Once the fires were started it was almost impossible to put them\r\nout. Kerosene-soaked wood is a very obstinate substance. Water had no\r\neffect on it. Chemicals alone extinguished it. Amazed crowds used to\r\nstand watching these magic flames. Often when the policemen tried to\r\nstamp the fires out, they succeeded only in scattering them.\r\n\r\nIt was an extraordinary effect, too, when the policemen were busy\r\nputting out one fire, to see others start up, in _this_ corner of the\r\nPark, in _that_ corner, in the great bronze urn, near the center.\r\n\r\nBuilding a fire in that bronze urn was as difficult a matter as it\r\nseems. A Woman’s Party member, glancing out from a stairway window at\r\nthe top of the house at Headquarters, had noted how boldly the urn stood\r\nout from the rest of the Park decoration....\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EVERY GOOD SUFFRAGIST THE MORNING AFTER RATIFICATION.\r\nNina Allender in _The Suffragist_.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAt three o’clock one morning, Julia Emory and Hazel Hunkins, two of the\r\nyoungest and tiniest pickets, bore over to the Park from Headquarters\r\nseveral baskets of wood which they concealed in the shadows under the\r\ntrees. The next problem was to get a ladder there without being seen.\r\nThey accomplished this in some way, dragging it over the ground, slow\r\nfoot after slow foot, and placed it against the urn. At intervals the\r\npoliceman on the beat, who was making the entire round—or square—of the\r\nPark, passed. While one girl mounted the rudder and filled the urn with\r\noil-soaked paper, oil-soaked wood, and liberal libations of oil, the\r\nother remained on guard. When the guard gave the word that the policeman\r\nwas near, the two girls threw themselves face downward on the frozen\r\ngrass. It is a very large urn and by this stealthy process it took hours\r\nto fill it. It was two days before they started the fire. Anybody might\r\nhave seen the logs protruding from the top of the urn during those two\r\ndays, but nobody did.\r\n\r\nThe day on which the urn projected itself into the history of the\r\nWoman’s Party, the Watchfires were burning for the first time on the\r\nWhite House pavements. The street and the Park were filled with people.\r\nA member of the Woman’s Party, passing the urn, furtively threw into it\r\na lighted asbestos coil. The urn instantly belched flames which\r\nthreatened to lick the sky. The police arrested every Woman’s Party\r\nmember in sight. All the way down the street as the patrol carried them\r\naway, Hazel Hutchins and Julia Emory saw the flames flaring higher and\r\nhigher.\r\n\r\n“How did they do that?” one man was heard to say. “I’ve been here the\r\nwhole afternoon and I didn’t see them light it.”\r\n\r\nTwice afterwards fires were started in the urn. For that matter, fires\r\nwere started there after the police had set a watch on it.\r\n\r\nHazel Hunkins, young, small, slender, took the urn under her special\r\npatronage. One of the pictures the Woman’s Party likes to draw is the\r\ntime Hazel was arrested there. She had climbed up onto the pedestal and\r\nwas throwing logs into the pool of oil when two huge policemen descended\r\nupon her. The first seized one foot and the second seized the other; and\r\nthey both pulled hard. Of course in these circumstances, it was\r\nimpossible for her to move. But she is an athlete and she clung tight to\r\nthe urn edge. Still the policemen pulled. Finally she said gently, “If\r\nyou will let go of my feet, I will come down myself.”\r\n\r\nLater asbestos coils were introduced into the campaign. This—from the\r\npolice point of view—was more annoying than the kerosene-soaked logs;\r\nfor they were compact to carry, easy to handle, difficult to put out,\r\nand they lasted a long, long time.\r\n\r\nAnother picture the Woman’s Party likes to draw is of Mildred Morris\r\nstarting asbestos coils. With her nimbus of flaming hair, Miss Morris\r\nseemed a flame herself. She was here, there, everywhere. The police\r\ncould no more catch up with her than they could with a squirrel. One\r\nnight, with the assistance of two others, she—unbelievably—fastened some\r\nasbestos coils among the White House trees; but to her everlasting\r\nregret the guards found them before the illumination could begin.\r\n\r\nThe stories they tell about arrests at this time are endless. Little\r\nJulia Emory, who was arrested thirty-four times, is a repository of lore\r\non this subject.\r\n\r\nThey were a great trial to the police—the arrests of these later months.\r\nWhile under detention, the pickets used to organize impromptu\r\nentertainments. This was during the period, when at their trials, the\r\nSuffragists would answer no questions and the court authorities were put\r\nto it to establish their identities. They related with great glee how in\r\nhis efforts to prove Annie Arniel’s identity, a policeman described one\r\nof their concerts in court.\r\n\r\n\r\n    And then, your Honor, that one there said, “We’ll now have a comb\r\n    solo from a distinguished combist, who has played before all the\r\n    crowned heads of Europe, Annie Arniel,” and then, your Honor, the\r\n    defendant got up and played a tune on a comb.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen, for instance, Suffragists refused bail, the police did not like to\r\nhold them overnight because it was such an expense to the District of\r\nColumbia to feed them. Julia Emory describes one evening when a roomful\r\nof them, arrested, and having refused to put up bail, were waiting the\r\nwill of the powers. During this wait, which lasted several hours, they\r\nentertained themselves by singing.\r\n\r\nOnce a policeman came in:\r\n\r\n“Will you pay your bail if we put it at twenty-five dollars?”\r\n\r\n“No,” answered the pickets promptly.\r\n\r\nHe went out, but later he returned.\r\n\r\n“Will you pay your bail if we put it at five dollars?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Then march out.”\r\n\r\nBut those light moments were only foam thrown up from serious and\r\nsometimes desperate times. When a crowd of ex-pickets gather together\r\nand indulge in reminiscences, extraordinary revelations occur. Looking\r\nat their faces and estimating their youth, one wonders at a world which\r\npermitted one per cent of these things to happen.\r\n\r\nAnd as for their experiences with the mobs.... Not the least of the\r\npsychological factors in the situation was the slow growth of the\r\ncrowds; the circle of little boys who gathered about them first,\r\nspitting at them, calling them names, making personal comments; then the\r\ngathering gangs of young hoodlums who encouraged the boys to further\r\ninsults; then more and more crowds; more and more insults; the final\r\nstruggle.\r\n\r\nOften of course the pickets stood against the White House fence, an\r\nenormous mob packed in front of them, with the knowledge that police\r\nprotection—according to the orders of the day—might be given them or\r\nmight not.... Sometimes that crowd would edge nearer and nearer until\r\nthere was but a foot of smothering, terror-fraught space between them\r\nand the pickets. Literally those women felt they had their backs to the\r\nwall. Occasionally they had to mount the stone coping! Always too they\r\nfeared that any sudden movement within the packed, slowly approaching\r\nhostile crowd might foam into violence. Occasionally, when the police\r\nfollowed orders to protect the pickets, violent things happened to\r\npeople in the crowd. Catherine Flanagan saw a plain-clothes man hit six\r\nsailors over the head in succession with a billy. They went down like\r\nnine pins. Yet when after hours of a seemingly impressive waiting the\r\nactual struggle came—something—some spiritual courage bigger than\r\nthemselves—impelled them to hold on to their banner poles to the last\r\ngasp. They were big in circumference—those banner poles—but the girls\r\nclutched them so tightly that often it took three policemen to wrench\r\nthem away. Catherine Flanagan had deep gashes on the inside of her palms\r\nwhere her own nails had penetrated her flesh and great wounds on the\r\noutside of her hands where the policemen had dug their nails into them.\r\nVirginia Arnold’s hands and arms were torn as though in a struggle with\r\nsome wild beast.\r\n\r\nYet, I repeat, Headquarters saw its lighter moments even in those most\r\ntroubled times. And during those most troubled times, that gay spirit of\r\nyouth managed to maintain itself. The onlookers marveled at it. But it\r\nwas only because it was a spiritual quality—youth of the soul, in\r\naddition to youth of the body—that it could endure. During the course of\r\nthe eight years of its history, the members of the Woman’s Party had\r\nbeen subjected to disillusion after disillusion. The older ones among\r\nthem bore this succession of shocks with that philosophy which a long\r\nexperience in public affairs engenders. But the younger ones—believing\r\nat first, as youth always believes, in the eternal verities, and in\r\ntheir eternal prevalence—witnessed faith-shaking sights and underwent\r\neven more faith-shaking experiences.\r\n\r\nIn their contact with public men, they saw such a man as Borah for\r\ninstance—perhaps the chief of the Knights of the Double Cross—give the\r\nWoman’s Party what virtually amounted to his pledged word to support the\r\nAmendment and then coolly repudiate it. They saw Moses of New Hampshire\r\nplay a quibbling trick on them which involved them in weeks of the\r\nhardest kind of work only calmly to ignore his own pledge at the end.\r\nThey contended with such differing personalities as the cold, cultured\r\nmind, immutably set in the conventions of a past generation, of Henry\r\nCabot Lodge; the unfairness, or fatuity, or brutality of such men as\r\nPenrose of Pennsylvania, Thomas of Colorado, Wadsworth of New York, Reed\r\nof Missouri, Brandegee of Connecticut, Hoke Smith of Georgia.\r\n\r\nWhen the picketing began, they saw outside forces get their Headquarters\r\nfrom them; saw them influence scores of property owners sometimes after\r\nan advance rent had been paid, not to let houses to them; saw them try\r\nto influence the people who gave money, to withhold such financial\r\nsupport; saw them try to influence the newspapers to be less impartial\r\nin their descriptions of Woman’s Party activities. As the picketing went\r\non and the burning of the President’s words and the Watchfires succeeded\r\nit—while they were exercising their inalienable right of peaceful\r\nprotest—they knew the experience of being harried by mobs at the very\r\ndoor of the President of the United States; harried while the President\r\npassed in his carriage through their midst; later to be harried in\r\ncollaboration by both mobs and police. Under arrest and in prison, they\r\nunderwent experiences which no one of them would have believed possible\r\nof the greatest republic in the world. They were held incommunicado;\r\nthey could see neither counsel nor Party members. They were offered food\r\nfilled with worms. They were submitted to incredible brutalities.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, I have said that spirit of youth prevailed. It prevailed\r\nbecause they were speaking for their generation. They developed a sense\r\nof devotion to their ideal of freedom which would have stopped short of\r\nno personal sacrifice, not death itself. They developed a sense of\r\ncomradeship for each other which was half love, half admiration and all\r\nreverence. In summing up a fellow worker, they speak first of her\r\n“spirit,” and her “spirit” is always _beautiful_, or _noble_, or\r\n_glorious_, or some such youth-loved word.\r\n\r\nOnce, when one party of pickets, about to leave Occoquan, was in the\r\ndining-room, a fresh group, just sentenced, were brought into luncheon\r\nand placed at another table. Conversation was not permitted. Not a word\r\nwas spoken, but with one accord the released pickets raised their\r\nwater-glasses high, then lowered them and drank to their comrades.\r\n\r\nYes, that was their strength—spirit of youth. Lavinia Dock said, “The\r\nyoung are at the gates.” The young stormed those gates and finally\r\nforced them open. They entered. And leaving behind all sinister\r\nremembrance of the battle, they turned their faces towards the morning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                THE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 INDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n Abbot, Minnie D., 225\r\n\r\n Adams, Abigail, 103\r\n\r\n Adams, Hazel, 357\r\n\r\n Adams, Pauline, 236, 238, 404, 407\r\n\r\n Adams, Mrs. Walter, 402\r\n\r\n Addams, Jane, 13, 39, 42\r\n\r\n Adler, Jessie, 389\r\n\r\n Ainge, Edith, 238, 357, 373, 374, 375, 377, 392, 393, 396, 400, 404,\r\n    407, 446\r\n\r\n Allen, Genevieve, 429, 449\r\n\r\n Allender, Nina, 15, 18, 19, 46, 208\r\n\r\n American Federation of Labor, 166\r\n\r\n Amidon, Beulah, 47, 124, 193, 203, 232, 342\r\n\r\n Andrews, Harriet U., 377, 393, 394, quoted 406\r\n\r\n Anglin, Margaret, 107\r\n\r\n Aniba, Isabel C., quoted 346\r\n\r\n Arizona ratifies, 423\r\n\r\n Arkansas ratifies, 439\r\n\r\n Armes, Mrs. George A., 63, quoted 92\r\n\r\n Arniel, Annie, 220, 221, 238, 357, 377, 392, 393, 394, 400, 401, 404,\r\n    472\r\n\r\n Arnold, Bertha, 332, 363, 372, 375, 377, 379, 381, 400, 407\r\n\r\n Arnold, Virginia, 71, 77, 124, 220, 221, 230, 233, 374, 375, 376, 377,\r\n    474\r\n\r\n Ascough, Lillian M., 357, 404\r\n\r\n Ascough, Mrs. W.
