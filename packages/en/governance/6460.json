It is with the hope of meeting such a demand that this text has\r\nbeen prepared.\r\n\r\nThe plan of the book calls for a word of explanation. It is poor\r\npedagogy to expect the student to attack the defects of American life,\r\nand at the same time to place in his hands a book which deals\r\npredominantly with the mechanism of government. As well send a boy to\r\na hardware store to buy tools before he is told whether he is to make\r\na mouse-trap or a boat. Furthermore, to spend much more time on the\r\nmechanism of government than on the actual problems of democracy is a\r\nmistake in emphasis. Government is a means, not an end. It is a tool\r\nby means of which we attack and solve our problems.\r\n\r\nTherefore the student of this text begins, not with the mechanism of\r\ngovernment, but with the historical background of American democracy,\r\nits origin, development, and promise for the future. Following this is\r\na brief survey of the economic life of the nation, because that\r\neconomic life constitutes the fundamental basis of our problems.\r\nConsiderable space has been devoted to a problem growing directly out\r\nof economic conditions, _i.e._ the question of social justice or\r\nindustrial reform. This is the most pressing question before any\r\nmodern people, but strangely enough one which heretofore has been\r\nneglected by our schools.\r\n\r\nBecause they tend to arise primarily from a bad economic situation,\r\nsuch social problems as industrial relations, health in industry, and\r\nimmigration are next considered. From social problems the text passes\r\nto the economic and social functions of government, and thence to the\r\nquestion of making government effective. The mechanism of government\r\nhas been placed last, and for the reason already given, _i.e._ because\r\na knowledge of the framework of government is valuable only after the\r\ncitizen knows something of the needs which that mechanism must be made\r\nto fill.\r\n\r\nIt has not been easy to compress into a single volume the most\r\nimportant of our national problems. Obviously, a rigid selection has\r\nbeen necessary. In this selection the aim has been to discuss the more\r\nimportant issues of American life, whether economic, social, or purely\r\npolitical. In dealing with these issues, the attempt has been made to\r\nkeep in mind the student's previous preparation; on the other hand,\r\nthe civic demands which the future will make upon him have not been\r\nignored. Some of the problems are difficult, but they are also of\r\nvital importance. Very shortly the student will be confronted, in his\r\neveryday activities, with such puzzling matters as socialism, the\r\ncontrol of immigration, and taxation reform. If the school does not\r\nprepare him to grapple with these questions intelligently, he can only\r\npartially fulfill the obligations of citizenship.\r\n\r\nThroughout the text the aim has been to go directly to the heart of\r\nthe problem under consideration. The student is not burdened with a\r\nmass of data which would prove confusing, and which would be out of\r\ndate before he is out of school. Instead, an effort has been made to\r\noutline, first the essential nature of the problem, and second the\r\nfundamental principles which affect its solution. Care has been taken\r\nto cultivate the problem attitude, and to encourage the spirit of\r\nindependent investigation and open-minded judgment on the part of the\r\nstudent.\r\n\r\nIt goes without saying that the success of this book will depend\r\nlargely upon the use which the teacher makes of it. The text aims to\r\nsupply the basic facts and the fundamental principles involved in\r\nspecific problems, but the teacher must interpret many of those facts\r\nand principles, and ought, in addition, to furnish illustrative\r\nmaterial. The book is not intended to be an encyclopedia, but rather a\r\nsuggestive guide.\r\n\r\nThe text covers the fundamentals of three distinct fields: economics,\r\nsociology, and government. Sufficient reference and topic work is\r\noffered to enable teachers to expand the text along particular lines.\r\nThus Part II might serve as a nucleus around which to build up a\r\nspecial course in economics, while Part III would serve as a basis for\r\na similar course in applied sociology, if for some reason it were not\r\nfeasible to take up other parts of the book.\r\n\r\nThough the text is the result of the co÷perative efforts of a\r\nconsiderable number of specialists, its treatment of the problems of\r\nAmerican life is neither dogmatic nor arbitrary. The effort has been\r\nto treat all of our problems sanely and hopefully, but at the same\r\ntime to make it clear that many of these questions are still unsettled\r\nand the best method of disposing of them is yet hotly debated. This\r\nfact has strongly influenced the manner in which the problems have\r\nbeen treated.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOPICS AND READINGS\r\n\r\nFollowing each chapter are suggestions for work to supplement the\r\ntext. These suggestions are of six kinds, and are intended to meet a\r\nvariety of needs.\r\n\r\nA number of easy questions on the text is first supplied.\r\n\r\nFollowing these is a number of required readings to supplement each\r\nchapter of the text. The student may be asked to read a single chapter\r\nfrom Williamson's _Readings in American Democracy_, collected and\r\narranged so as to furnish in compact form and in a single volume\r\nsupplementary material which otherwise the teacher would have to find\r\nin a number of separate books. In case the use of the _Readings_ is\r\nnot feasible, some or all of the alternative required readings may be\r\navailable.\r\n\r\nThe required readings are followed by a number of questions thereon.\r\nQuestions on the material contained in Williamson's _Readings in\r\nAmerican Democracy_ will be found at the end of each chapter in that\r\nvolume; questions on the required readings cited as alternative to\r\nthis volume will be found at the end of each chapter in the text.\r\n\r\nTopic work is provided in two groups. Topics in the first group form a\r\nlink between the text and the everyday experience of the student on\r\nthe one hand, and between the activities of the student's local\r\ncommunity and national problems on the other. The student is called\r\nupon, for example, to investigate the attitude of the local press\r\ntoward controversial questions, or to examine the administration of\r\nlocal charitable relief. Topic work of this sort not only quickens the\r\ninterest of the student, but it encourages original investigation and\r\nindependent thought. It lets the student know what is going on in his\r\ncommunity, and it informs individuals and institutions beyond the\r\nschool that this agency is beginning to connect with the problems of\r\nthe municipality, state, and nation. This sort of topic work also\r\nallows the student to test the accuracy of the text, and to interpret\r\nlocal conditions in the light of broad, national tendencies.\r\n\r\nThe second group of topics contains material for report work. In the\r\ncase of practically all of these topics, the student is referred\r\nspecifically to books and other publications.\r\n\r\nBeginning with Chapter XVIII of the text, the topics are followed by a\r\nseries of questions for classroom discussion. Some of these may be\r\nturned into classroom debates. Others allow the student to challenge\r\nstatements in the text. A few of these questions have never been\r\nsatisfactorily answered by anyone, yet the student must face them in\r\nthe world outside the school, and it cannot be time wasted to\r\nunderstand their content now.\r\n\r\n\r\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\r\n\r\nIn the preparation of this text the author has received valuable\r\nassistance from a number of sources. Though such assistance in no way\r\ndiminishes his responsibility for the shortcomings of the book, the\r\nauthor desires here to acknowledge the aid extended him.\r\n\r\nThe entire manuscript has been carefully worked over and criticized by\r\nClarence D.

THE MEANING OF NATIONAL GREATNESS.--We apply the term greatness to\r\nnations that have made substantial contributions to civilization. By\r\ncivilization is meant a well-rounded and highly developed culture, or,\r\nto say the same thing in different words, an advanced state of\r\nmaterial and social well-being.\r\n\r\nCivilization is so vast and so many-sided that it may receive\r\ncontributions in very diverse forms. The invention of the hieroglyphic\r\nsystem of writing is among the leading achievements of ancient Egypt,\r\nbut the art and literature of Greece have been no less conspicuous in\r\nthe onward sweep of human progress. The promotion of the science of\r\nnavigation by the Phoenicians, and the development of law and\r\narchitecture by Rome, illustrate a few of the forms in which peoples\r\nmay confer marked benefits upon the world. The advancement of music\r\nand painting by Italy, France, and other European nations, and the\r\napplication and expansion of the idea of parliamentary government by\r\nEngland, are further examples of ways in which nations may earn for\r\nthemselves the title of greatness.\r\n\r\n2. THE CONDITIONS OF NATIONAL GREATNESS.--In order that a nation may\r\nbecome great, _i.e._ make some distinct contribution to civilization,\r\ntwo conditions must be fulfilled.\r\n\r\nThe first condition of national greatness is that the land under that\r\nnation's control must be encouraging to man's honest, helpful efforts.\r\n[Footnote: As used in this chapter the term \"land\" is held to include\r\nnot only such natural resources as soil, minerals, forests, and bodies\r\nof water, but climate as well.] The vigorous Scandinavians have made\r\ngreat advances in inhospitable Iceland and Greenland, the French have\r\nreclaimed an important section of Algeria, and the British have worked\r\nwonders with some of the barren parts of Australia; nevertheless, it\r\nis with great difficulty that prosperous communities are developed in\r\nlands relatively barren of natural resources, or unusually severe in\r\nclimate.\r\n\r\nA high and stable civilization has rarely arisen in the tropics,\r\nbecause there the overabundance of Nature renders sustained work\r\nunnecessary, while the hot, enervating climate tends to destroy\r\ninitiative and ambition. It is no accident that the greatest nations\r\nof modern times are located chiefly within the stimulating temperate\r\nzones, where Nature is richly endowed, but where, too, her treasures\r\nare rarely bestowed upon those who do not struggle consistently for\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe second condition of national greatness is an intelligent and\r\nindustrious population, willing to abide by the law, and devoted to\r\nthe building of homes. The combination of an unpromising land and an\r\ninferior population effectually prevents the rise of a high\r\ncivilization. And just as the choicest of men can do relatively little\r\nin an unfriendly land, so the most promising of countries may be\r\ndespoiled or temporarily ruined by a slothful or lawless population.\r\n\r\nFrom the standpoint of civilization, the best results are obtained\r\nwhen a virile and law-abiding people exercise control over a land rich\r\nin natural resources and possessed of a stimulating climate. France\r\nand Great Britain in Europe, and Canada and the United States in North\r\nAmerica, are examples of great nations which have been built up in\r\nsuch lands and by such peoples.\r\n\r\n3. THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF NORTH AMERICA.--It will be interesting to\r\nexamine North America in the light of the two conditions of national\r\ngreatness discussed in the preceding section. We may note, first of\r\nall, that by far the greater part of the territory now comprising the\r\nUnited States and Canada is distinctly favorable to settlement. This\r\nterritory lies almost entirely within the temperate zone: it has\r\nunattractive spots, but in general it is neither so barren of\r\nresources as to discourage the home-maker, nor so tropical in its\r\nabundance as to reward him without his putting forth considerable\r\neffort. Particularly within the bounds of the United States is a well-\r\nbalanced national life encouraged by the diversity of soils and the\r\nwide variety of climate. [Footnote: For a fuller discussion of the\r\nnatural resources of the United States, see Chapter VI.] Certainly the\r\ncontinent of North America fulfills the first condition of national\r\ngreatness.\r\n\r\n4. THE COMING OF THE EUROPEAN.--The discovery of America in 1492\r\nopened a new era in world history. The nations of western Europe were\r\ndisappointed when their earlier explorers found the way to Cathay\r\nblocked by a new land-mass, but the Spanish discovery of treasure in\r\nMexico and South America soon turned disappointment into keen\r\ninterest. No magic palaces or spice islands were found, but there were\r\nrevealed two virgin continents inviting colonial expansion on a scale\r\npreviously unknown. Of the European powers which at various times laid\r\nclaim to parts of the New World, Spain, France, Holland, and England\r\noccupy significant positions in the background of American democracy.\r\nWe may briefly notice the influence of each of these four powers upon\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\n5. SPAIN.--Though the Spanish were the first in the field, the motives\r\nof the colonists limited their ultimate success in the new land. The\r\nearlier Spaniards were missionaries and treasure-seekers, rather than\r\nhome builders and artisans. The early discovery of great quantities of\r\ngold and silver had the effect of encouraging the continued search for\r\ntreasure. In this treasure-quest, often fruitless, the Spanish\r\npractically confined themselves to Mexico and the region to the south.\r\nIn these areas they did valuable work in Christianizing and educating\r\nthe natives, but little industrial progress was made. Except for the\r\nmissionary work of the Spanish, their earlier colonization was largely\r\ntransient and engaged in for the purpose of exploitation.\r\n\r\n6. FRANCE.--France disputed the claim of Spain to North America soon\r\nafter the opening of the sixteenth century. The French attempted to\r\nsettle in Florida and in South Carolina, but the opposition of the\r\nnear-by Spanish forced the newcomers to leave. In 1524 Verrazano\r\nexplored the North Atlantic coast for the French, and ten years later\r\nCartier sailed up the St. Lawrence and founded the claim of France to\r\nthat section of the New World.\r\n\r\nFollowing the example of Spain, France dispatched missionaries to the\r\nNew World to convert the Indians. Soldiers and trappers were sent out\r\nto develop the valuable fur trade by the establishment of widely\r\nseparated forts and trading posts. But the French settlers had no\r\npopular lawmaking bodies, being completely under the power of the\r\nking. Only along the St. Lawrence, where agricultural colonies were\r\nplanted, did the French really attach themselves to the soil.\r\nElsewhere there were few French women and therefore few normal French\r\nhomes, and when in 1763 all of the French possessions east of the\r\nMississippi were ceded to England, it was largely true that the French\r\ncolonies had not yet taken root in the country. Infinite courage,\r\ndevotion, and self-sacrifice were ultimately wasted, largely because\r\nof the lack of homes, the absence of self-government, and the failure\r\nto develop an industrial basis of colonization.\r\n\r\n7. HOLLAND.--The Dutch became aware of the commercial possibilities of\r\nthe New World when in 1609 Henry Hudson discovered the river which\r\nbears his name. Trading posts were soon established in the\r\nneighborhood, and in 1621 the West India Company was given full\r\nauthority to plant colonies in New Netherland. A brisk trade in furs\r\ndeveloped, but though the Company grew rich, the colonists were not\r\nsatisfied. The agriculturists along the Hudson had the benefit of a\r\nfertile soil and a genial climate, but they operated their farms under\r\na feudal land system which allowed an overlord to take most of their\r\nsurplus produce. Moreover, the Dutch governors were autocratic, and\r\nthe settlers had little voice in the government of the colony. Loyalty\r\nto Holland waned as the Dutch saw their English neighbors thriving\r\nunder less restrictive laws and a more generous land system, so that\r\nwhen in 1664 the colony passed into the possession of the English, the\r\nmajority of the settlers welcomed the change.\r\n\r\n8. ENGLAND.--The Spanish had been in the New World a century before\r\nthe English made any appreciable impression upon the continent of\r\nNorth America. In 1583 Sir Humphrey Gilbert had made an unsuccessful\r\nattempt to found a colony on the coast of Newfoundland, and a few\r\nyears later Sir Walter Raleigh's venture at Roanoke Island proved\r\nequally disastrous. Colonization was retarded until 1588, in which\r\nyear England's defeat of the Spanish Armada destroyed the sea power of\r\nher most formidable rival. The English may be said to have made\r\nserious and consistent attempts at colonization only after this event.\r\n\r\nLike France, England desired to set herself up as a successful\r\ncolonizing rival of Spain. Impelled by this motive, the earlier\r\nEnglish adventurers sought treasure rather than homes. But the high\r\nhopes of the early English joint stock companies were not justified.\r\nThose who had looked to America for treasure were disappointed: no\r\ngold was forthcoming, and such groups as the Jamestown settlers of\r\n1607 very nearly perished before they learned that America's treasure-\r\nhouse could be unlocked only by hard work. In spite of heavy\r\ninvestments and repeated attempts at colonization, these first\r\nventures were largely failures.\r\n\r\n9. THE COMING OF THE HOME-MAKER.--It may truly be said that the seeds\r\nof national greatness were not planted in America until home-making\r\nsucceeded exploitation by governments and joint stock companies. Home-\r\nmaking received little or no encouragement in the early Spanish,\r\nFrench, and Dutch colonies. Almost from the first, England allowed her\r\ncolonies a large measure of self-government, but it is significant\r\nthat these colonies made little progress so long as they were\r\ndominated by joint stock companies intent upon exploitation. It was\r\nonly when individuals, and groups of individuals, settled\r\nindependently of the companies that the colonies began to thrive. The\r\nfirst really tenacious settlers on the Atlantic seaboard were groups\r\nof families who were willing to brave the dangers of an unknown land\r\nfor the sake of religious freedom, economic independence, and a large\r\nshare of self-government. It was with the coming of these people that\r\nour second condition of national greatness was fulfilled.\r\n\r\n10. GROWTH OF THE ENGLISH COLONIES.--The English annexation of New\r\nNetherland in 1664, and the concessions of the French in 1763, left\r\nthe English in undisputed possession of the greater part of the\r\nAtlantic seaboard. The English colonies in this area grew with\r\nastonishing rapidity. Cheap land, religious freedom, and the privilege\r\nof self-government attracted settlers from all parts of northern\r\nEurope. At the close of the seventeenth century there were 260,000\r\nEnglish subjects in North America; in 1750 there were approximately\r\n1,000,000; and in 1775 there were probably 3,000,000.\r\n\r\nAlthough in most sections the dominant element was of English\r\nextraction, other nationalities contributed to the population. Along\r\nthe Delaware, Swedes were interspersed with the English, while in\r\nPennsylvania there were large groups of Germans. Numerous Dutch\r\nsettlers had continued to live along the Hudson after New Netherland\r\nhad passed into English hands. Some of the most frugal and industrious\r\nof the settlers of Georgia and South Carolina were French Huguenots,\r\nwhile along the seaboard and inland the Scotch-Irish were found\r\nscatteringly in agriculture and trade. Such was the composition of the\r\npeople who were destined to begin an unexampled experiment in\r\ndemocracy, an experiment upon the successful termination of which\r\nrests our chief claim to national greatness.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS ON THE TEXT\r\n\r\n1.

THE NATURE OF GOVERNMENT.--A government may be defined as an\r\nagency through which the purposes of a state or nation are formulated\r\nand carried out. This agency develops where men live in groups. One of\r\nthe chief objects of government is to adjust individual interests, or,\r\nto say the same thing in slightly different words, to control members\r\nof the group in their social relations.\r\n\r\nWhere groups are small and culture is at a low level, government may\r\nconsist in little more than the arbitrary rules of a self-appointed\r\nchieftain. From this stage there are numerous gradations up to the\r\ngreat complex governments of the leading nations of to-day. With the\r\norigin and general development of government we are not here\r\nconcerned, and we may accordingly confine our attention to those types\r\nof modern government which throw light upon the development of\r\nAmerican democracy.\r\n\r\n12. THE ABSOULUTE MONARCHY.--An absolute monarchy may be defined as a\r\ngovernment in which supreme power or sovereignty is lodged in one\r\nindividual. This monarch holds his position for life, generally with\r\nhereditary succession. Often the absolute monarchy arose out of the\r\nancient chieftainship, when, as the result of territorial expansion\r\nand cultural development, the chief of a group of tribes became the\r\nking of a settled and civilized people. The absolute monarchy existed\r\nin most of the countries of Europe previous to the end of the\r\neighteenth century. In its most extreme form the absolute monarchy\r\nrested upon the claim of the monarch that he ruled by \"divine right,\"\r\n_i.e.,_ that God had authorized him to rule. France in the era of\r\nLouis XIV is one of the best known examples of a modern nation ruled\r\nby a \"divine right\" monarch.\r\n\r\n13. THE LIMITED MONARCHY.--When a monarch has been restricted in his\r\npowers a limited or constitutional monarchy is said to exist. Almost\r\nalways the establishment of a limited monarchy has been preceded by a\r\nseries of struggles between king and people. In many cases these\r\nstruggles have been precipitated or intensified by the monarch's abuse\r\nof power. A striking example is offered by English history. As the\r\nresult of his arbitrary rule, King John was in 1215 obliged to sign\r\nthe Magna Charta, by which act he gave up many important powers. The\r\nlimits thus set upon the kingly power were affirmed and extended by\r\nthe Petition of Right of 1628 and by the Bill of Rights of 1689. A\r\nsimilar limiting process has gone on in other countries, either by the\r\nframing of constitutions, or by the enlargement of the powers of\r\nlegislatures, or by both methods. To-day the absolute monarchy is\r\npractically unknown among civilized nations.\r\n\r\n14. THE REPUBLIC.--The republic is a form of government in which\r\nultimate power or sovereignty resides with the people as a whole\r\nrather than with a single individual. Instead of a monarch there is\r\ngenerally an elective president, with varying powers. The republic is\r\na very old form of government, but in the republics of Greece, Rome\r\nand Venice the powers of government were exercised by a class composed\r\nof a small minority of the people. In modern republics a larger\r\nproportion of the adult population participates in government.\r\n\r\nA republic may arise in any one of several ways, but most of the\r\nrepublics of modern times have grown out of monarchical conditions,\r\neither directly or indirectly. Our republic arose as a reaction\r\nagainst English monarchy, while the French republic came into being as\r\nthe result of the destruction of a monarchical government. Most of the\r\nrepublics of Latin America date from the throwing off of the Spanish\r\nyoke in the first half of the nineteenth century. More recently, the\r\nWorld War has given rise to a number of European republics, composed\r\nof peoples formerly under the control of monarchical governments.\r\n\r\n15. DEMOCRACY AS A POLITICAL IDEA.--The term democracy is derived from\r\ntwo Greek words which taken together mean \"control by the people.\"\r\nStrictly speaking, democracy is a _form_ of government only where a\r\nsmall group governs itself directly, _i.e.,_ without making use of the\r\nrepresentative device. This \"pure\" democracy, such as existed in the\r\nearly New England town, becomes a representative democracy, or a\r\nrepublic, when a greater population and an increasing political\r\ncomplexity require the people to act through their representatives,\r\nrather than as a body. In the sense that democracy is popular control,\r\nthe term democracy may conceivably be applied to any form of\r\ngovernment. The present government of Great Britain, for example, is\r\ntechnically a limited monarchy, yet the gradual extension of popular\r\ncontrol has made it one of the most democratic governments in the\r\nworld. Nevertheless, the modern republic is so generally associated\r\nwith the democratic movement that many authorities speak of a\r\ndemocracy as identical with a republic. For the time being we may use\r\nthe term democracy to describe a form of government in which\r\nconsiderable control is exercised by the people. More briefly,\r\ndemocracy may be thought of as self-government.\r\n\r\n16. WHY DEMOCRACY DEVELOPED IN AMERICA.--There are four reasons why\r\ndemocracy developed early in America.\r\n\r\nThe first is to be found in the conditions of pioneer life in the\r\ncolonies. The wilderness forced self-government upon the settlers.\r\nClearing the forests, subduing the Indians, and conquering animal foes\r\nwas stern work, which weeded out the indolent and inefficient, and\r\nrewarded the capable and self-reliant. Pioneer conditions did not\r\nencourage a cringing or submissive spirit, but fostered independence\r\nand individualism. The spirit of equality tended to become a dominant\r\nfeature of American life, for despite the existence of social classes,\r\nthe great majority of the population had to rely for their living upon\r\ntheir own efforts. Under such conditions self-reliance and self-\r\ngovernment were natural developments.\r\n\r\nThe selected character of the colonists is a second reason for the\r\nrise of democracy in America. Restless spirits who had chafed under\r\nthe restraints of monarchy in Europe, thronged to the new land. Once\r\nhere they often found the older American communities intolerant, and\r\nso struck out into the wilderness to found new and, to them, more\r\ndemocratic colonies. The founding of Rhode Island by Roger Williams,\r\nand the settlement of the Connecticut valley by Thomas Hooker,\r\nillustrate this tendency.\r\n\r\nIt should be remembered, thirdly, that the English colonists brought\r\nwith them very definite ideas as to the rights of man. The concessions\r\ngranted by the Magna Charta were made an essential part of their\r\npolitical philosophy. The belief that all men were born free and\r\nequal, and that government derives its just powers from the consent of\r\nthe governed, became prominent in early American politics. Where the\r\ndemocratic tendencies of the settlers were reinforced by such\r\ntraditions, an oppressive government could not last. In Carolina in\r\n1670, for example, an attempt to set up an undemocratic government\r\nfailed, and when half a century later a similar attempt was made in\r\nGeorgia, the settlers objected so ardently that the founders of the\r\ncolony were obliged to grant the privilege of self-government.\r\n\r\nA fourth explanation of the rise of democracy in America is that, left\r\nto themselves, the settlers came to feel that self-government was\r\nmorally right. Largely removed from the traditions of monarchy, they\r\nsoon realized the elemental significance of government. Seeing\r\ngovernment as a device to help people get along together, they\r\nconcluded that that government is best which most helps the masses of\r\nthe people. The existence of a British monarch was a small factor in\r\nthe everyday life of the early settlers, and from this it was a short\r\nstep to asserting that his control over them was unjust. Living under\r\nprimitive economic conditions, the minds of the people turned\r\nnaturally to freely formed agreements as a basis of group action.\r\nUnder such conditions democracy appeared to the colonists as moral,\r\njust, and natural.\r\n\r\n17. APPLYING THE DEMOCRATIC IDEA.--Partly because of the isolation of\r\nearly American life, and partly because England was busy with European\r\npolitics, the settlers were left relatively free to work out their\r\nideas of democracy. The Pilgrims had not yet set foot upon the new\r\nland when they drew up the Mayflower Compact, by the terms of which\r\nthey agreed to establish a pure democracy in their new home. In 1639\r\nthe inhabitants of three Connecticut towns came together in a mass\r\nmeeting, and drew up the Connecticut Fundamental Orders, which many\r\nauthorities regard as the first written constitution in this country.\r\nAside from the fact that the Orders created a small republic in the\r\nheart of the wilderness, they are of importance because they issued\r\ndirectly from the people, without suggestion from, or direction by,\r\nany outside agency. Elsewhere in New England, too, local self-\r\ngovernment was a spontaneous growth. Usually the settlers grouped\r\nthemselves in small, compact communities known as towns, the freemen\r\ncoming together in the town meeting for the purpose of passing laws\r\nand electing officials. The town meeting constituted a pure democracy,\r\nin which the freemen governed themselves consciously and directly.\r\n\r\n18. SPREAD OF THE REPRESENTATIVE IDEA.--The principle of\r\nrepresentative government appeared very early in English history,\r\nexpressing itself most clearly in the houses of Parliament. The\r\nprinciple was early transplanted to America, for in 1619 we find the\r\nLondon Company establishing in Virginia a House of Burgesses, the\r\nfirst representative assembly in the New World. The representative\r\ndemocracy spread rapidly through the colonies, in many cases replacing\r\nthe pure democracy as a form of local government. In Massachusetts\r\nBay, for example, the population of the colony became so dispersed,\r\nand the complexity of its government so great, that it was necessary\r\nfor most freemen to remain at home, and to content themselves with\r\nchoosing a small number of individuals to represent their interests.\r\nThese representatives gathered in the General Court and transacted the\r\nbusiness of the colony.\r\n\r\n19. THE SEPARATION OF POWERS.--As government develops in scope and\r\ncomplexity, there is a tendency for the agents of government to\r\nspecialize in various types of work. A more or less recognizable\r\nseparation of the governmental machinery into legislative, executive,\r\nand judicial branches had long been a feature of English government.\r\nEarly in the seventeenth century this principle was transferred to the\r\ngovernment of the English colonies in America. There was established\r\nin each colony a legislative branch for the enactment of laws, an\r\nexecutive branch to see that the laws were enforced, and a judicial\r\nbranch for the interpretation of the laws. This separation of\r\nfunctions was more definite in America than in England because the\r\njealousy existing between colonial legislature and colonial executive\r\ntended sharply to separate their powers. In America, too, the\r\njudiciary was more clearly an independent branch of government than in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\n20. THE COLONIES AS SELF-GOVERNING STATES.--It has often been said\r\nthat for a considerable period prior to the American Revolution, the\r\nthirteen colonies were in reality self-governing states. For most\r\npractical purposes they were independent, indeed, some American\r\npatriots insisted that they were only nominally subject to England. In\r\neach colony there was an assembly chosen by a restricted number of\r\nvoters. This popular assembly championed the cause of the colonists\r\nagainst the governor, who in most of the colonies was primarily an\r\nagent of the Crown. After the middle of the eighteenth century, the\r\nstruggles between assembly and governor increased in number and in\r\nintensity, and victory rested more and more often with the assembly.\r\n[Footnote: For the similarities existing among the various colonial\r\ngovernments see Chapter XXXIX.]\r\n\r\n21. EFFECT OF THE REVOLUTION UPON AMERICAN GOVERNMENTS.--The\r\nRevolution did not greatly affect the character of American\r\ngovernments. Democracy, at first weak and ill diffused, had been\r\nspreading steadily during the preceding century, and when at last the\r\nbreak with England came, it found the states trained in self-\r\ngovernment and able to conduct their own affairs. In many cases the\r\nRevolution simply erased the name of the king from documents and\r\ninstitutions already American in spirit and character. The states\r\neither retained their old charters as constitutions, as in the case of\r\nConnecticut and Rhode Island, or framed new constitutions based upon\r\nthe experience of colonial government. The popular legislative\r\nassembly was everywhere retained. The common law of England continued\r\nin force, and the system of courts was retained in practically its\r\npre-Revolution form. The basis of state government had been laid long\r\nbefore the Revolution, the new states simply accepting the basic\r\npolitical principles with which they, as colonies, had long been\r\nfamiliar. The defeat of English claims was only an incident in the\r\nirresistible progress of American democracy.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS ON THE TEXT\r\n\r\n1.

LOCAL VERSUS NATIONAL SPIRIT.--The outbreak of the American\r\nRevolution proved that the colonies were so deeply attached to\r\ndemocracy that they were willing to fight for it. But the spirit which\r\nanimated the Revolution was local, rather than national. The colonial\r\nprotests which in 1776 reached their climax in the Declaration of\r\nIndependence, had to do almost entirely with the rights of the\r\ncolonies as individual states, and with the determination of those\r\nstates to defend the principle of self-government. The war created\r\nthirteen practically independent states, among which the spirit of\r\nstate sovereignty was much stronger than was the inclination to form\r\nan indissoluble union. The Revolution emphasized local and state\r\ninterests rather than intercolonial co÷peration, and however much the\r\ncolonists appreciated local democracy in 1776, they had yet to learn\r\nto think in terms of a national patriotism. A brief review of the\r\nattempts at union before 1787 will serve to illustrate this important\r\npoint.\r\n\r\n23. EARLY ATTEMPTS AT UNION.--The first notable attempt at union was\r\nmade in 1643, when Massachusetts Bay, Plymouth, Connecticut, and New\r\nHaven formed a league, chiefly for the purpose of mutual defense. This\r\nleague was in force for forty years, and rendered effective service in\r\nthe Indian wars.\r\n\r\nIn 1754 delegates from seven of the colonies met at Albany and adopted\r\na plan of union proposed by Benjamin Franklin. The plan provided for a\r\ncolonial army, the control of public lands, legislation affecting the\r\ngeneral welfare, and the levying of taxes for intercolonial projects.\r\nIn America Franklin's plan was regarded with considerable favor, but\r\nit was never given serious consideration by the British Parliament.\r\nThe project fell through.\r\n\r\nStill later (1765) delegates from nine of the colonies met in the\r\nStamp Act Congress, for the purpose of drawing up a protest against\r\nthe taxation policy of the mother country.\r\n\r\nThe two continental congresses may also be regarded as steps toward\r\nunion. The first of these met in 1774 and concerned itself chiefly\r\nwith a declaration of rights and grievances. The second (1775-1781)\r\nassumed revolutionary powers, and, with the consent of the people,\r\nexercised those powers during the greater part of the war period.\r\n\r\n24. THE ARTICLES OF CONFEDERATION.--Nothing so clearly illustrates the\r\nsectional feeling of that era as the history of the Articles of\r\nConfederation. The Articles were adopted by the Second Continental\r\nCongress in 1777, but on account of the tardiness with which some of\r\nthe states ratified them, they were not put into actual operation\r\nuntil March 1, 1781. By the terms of the Articles the states yielded\r\nsome of their powers, the central government being given the right to\r\ndeclare war, borrow and coin money, establish post offices, and\r\notherwise act for the general good. On the other hand, the Articles\r\ndeclared that \"each state retains its sovereignty, freedom and\r\nindependence, and every power, jurisdiction, and right which is not by\r\nthis federation delegated to the United States.\"\r\n\r\nThus the new government was a confederation or league of states,\r\nrather than a federal government such as we have to-day. There was no\r\nnational executive, and no judiciary. All authority was concentrated\r\nin a one-chambered congress, in which each state was represented by\r\nnot fewer than two and not more than seven members. The delegates were\r\nsubject to recall by the legislatures of their respective states. Each\r\nstate had one vote, which was determined by a majority of the state's\r\ndelegates who were present when the vote was taken.\r\n\r\n25. DEFECTS OF THE CONFEDERATION GOVERNMENT.--The government\r\nestablished by the Articles of Confederation had a number of grave\r\ndefects. The fundamental difficulty was that the central government\r\nhad no real authority or power. The Congress of the Confederation\r\ncould reach individuals only through the action of the state\r\ngovernments, and these it could not coerce. Thus the Congress could\r\ndeclare war, and make requisitions upon the states for troops, but it\r\ncould not enlist a single soldier. It could make laws, but had no\r\npower to enforce them. It could make treaties with foreign\r\ngovernments, but could not oblige the states to respect those\r\nagreements. The central government could not levy taxes, but was\r\nobliged to accept whatever sums the states chose to contribute. The\r\nConfederation government could not even protect itself, or the states,\r\nagainst violence. It lacked force, and without the ability to exert\r\nforce, a government is a government in name only.\r\n\r\nNot only did the central government fail to enlist the respect and\r\nsupport of the states, but it could not induce the states to respect\r\nor support one another. Congress had no power to regulate either\r\nforeign or domestic commerce, each state being free to control the\r\ncommercial activities of its citizens as it saw fit In many cases the\r\nstates engaged in trade wars, that is, they levied heavy duties upon\r\nthe commerce of one another, or even refused to allow their citizens\r\nto buy goods from, or sell goods to, persons in neighboring states.\r\nMatters calling for unity of action and friendly co÷peration, such as\r\nroads and canals, were ignored or neglected because of interstate\r\njealousy. Whereas they should have united against the grave dangers of\r\nthe period immediately following the war, the states often wasted time\r\nand energy in controversy and strife.\r\n\r\n26. FAILURE OF THE CONFEDERATION GOVERNMENT.--The Confederation\r\ngovernment, established in 1781, functioned weakly during the\r\nremaining two years of the war, and then declined rapidly in power and\r\ninfluence. The defects of the Articles could not be remedied, for\r\namendment was by unanimous consent only, and on every occasion that an\r\namendment was proposed, one or more states refused their assent.\r\n\r\nAccording to John Fiske, the five years following the peace of 1783\r\nconstituted the most critical period in the history of the American\r\npeople. Business was demoralized. Most of the states were issuing\r\nworthless paper money, and several of them passed laws impairing the\r\nobligation of contracts. In a movement known as Shay's Rebellion\r\n(1786-1787), a portion of the debtor class of Massachusetts attempted\r\nto prevent the collection of debts. Paper money depreciated so greatly\r\nthat in many places it ceased to pass as currency. The central\r\ngovernment could not raise money to meet its ordinary expenses, and in\r\n1783 Congress was forced to flee Philadelphia to escape the wrath of\r\nsome eighty Pennsylvania soldiers whom it could not pay.\r\n\r\nDemoralization and civil strife at home were matched by ridicule and\r\nsuspicion abroad. Congress could not pay the interest on the national\r\ndebt. As early as 1783 our foreign credit was gone. Many European\r\nstatesmen scoffed at the American government. France denied the\r\nexistence of a general government in America. In England our\r\ndiplomatic representatives suffered numerous humiliations. They were\r\ntold, for example, that the British would not relinquish the western\r\nforts promised us by the Treaty of Paris until our national government\r\nwas able to force the several American states to observe the treaty.\r\n\r\n27. OBSTACLES TO UNION.--There are three important reasons why the\r\nstates failed to draw together into a firm union before 1787.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, each state considered itself a sovereign body, and\r\nof governments above and beyond itself it was naturally suspicious.\r\nMany of the Americans had regarded the British government as a super-\r\ngovernment, imposed against the will of the American people, and\r\nmaintained in spite of their protests. The Dominion of New England,\r\nwhich, prior to the adoption of the Articles of Confederation, had\r\nbeen the nearest approach to union, was recalled with anger and in\r\nfear. This plan, forced upon the Americans in 1686 by the king, united\r\neight of the colonies under the rule of Governor Andros. The union was\r\ndissolved by the Bloodless Revolution of 1688, but the arbitrary rule\r\nof Andros was long cited by the Americans as proof of the despotic\r\ncharacter of any government beyond that of the individual states.\r\n\r\nA second explanation of the failure of the states to unite before 1787\r\nis to be found in the social and economic differences existing among\r\nthe states. Most of the inhabitants of New England were grouped in\r\nsmall, compact communities, and were engaged in shipbuilding and\r\ncommerce, rather than in agriculture. There was an aristocratic group,\r\nbut most of the people belonged to the middle class, and were simple\r\nand even severe in their tastes. In the middle colonies, on the other\r\nhand, most of the people were small farmers of mixed religious and\r\nracial character. Social classes existed to a considerable extent.\r\nFinally, the South was devoted to large plantations, cultivated by\r\nblack slaves. Social lines were sharply drawn, and a genuine\r\naristocratic class was already well formed.\r\n\r\nA third reason for the weakness of the co÷perative spirit among the\r\nstates is to be found in the lack of means of transportation and\r\ncommunication. Travel was mostly confined to natural waterways, or to\r\nrude paths over which horses proceeded with great difficulty. As late\r\nas 1800 it often took a horseman longer to go from Boston to New York\r\nthan it now takes to go by rail from New York to San Francisco and\r\nback again. There were no railroads in those days, no telephones, no\r\ntelegraph, and practically no postal service. Life was primarily\r\nrural, even on the seacoast. Most interests centered about the local\r\ncommunity, or at farthest, about the colony or state. In many sections\r\nthere was little exchange of products or of ideas. From the resulting\r\nisolation there developed a strong feeling of localism or\r\nprovincialism. Ignorance and suspicion of intercolonial affairs gave\r\nrise to misunderstandings, and emphasized differences and disputes\r\nwhich in themselves were unimportant. Thus jealousy and hostility\r\noften sprang up where mutual confidence and co÷peration were sorely\r\nneeded.\r\n\r\n28. NEGATIVE FORCES FAVORING UNION.--The failure of the Articles of\r\nConfederation is one of the most discouraging chapters in the\r\ndevelopment of American democracy. And yet it is an indispensable\r\nchapter, for it demonstrated, far more convincingly than could any\r\ntheoretical argument, that there must be one great American nation\r\nrather than thirteen or more unrelated republics. Six years of\r\npractical experience with the Articles of Confederation taught the\r\nabsolute necessity of a strong central government. The weaknesses of\r\nthe Confederation government constituted the most spectacular of the\r\nforces favoring union in 1787, and yet these forces were negative in\r\ncharacter: the states accepted the Constitution of 1787 not so much\r\nbecause they were attracted by it, as because they saw little chance\r\nof getting along without it.\r\n\r\n29. POSITIVE FORCES FAVORING UNION.--It should be noted, on the other\r\nhand, that for a long period previous to the adoption of the\r\nConstitution of 1787, certain positive forces were impelling the\r\nstates toward union. In their Old World homes most of the settlers had\r\noccupied somewhat the same social position, and had been used to\r\nsomewhat the same economic conditions. This common background\r\nconstituted, in their New World homes, a unifying force of great\r\nimportance. Long before 1787, too, the great majority of the settlers\r\nwere of English descent, speaking the English language, and, except\r\nfor the Roman Catholics of Maryland, professing some form of\r\nProtestantism.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the numerous jealousies and rivalries among the various\r\nsections of the country, there were at work forces which tended to\r\nbreak down the spirit of localism or provincialism. Though the\r\nRevolution established thirteen separate states, the war had\r\nencouraged the Americans to feel that they were a single people with a\r\ncommon destiny. The soldiers of various sections had rubbed elbows\r\nwith one another during the French and Indian wars, and during the\r\nRevolution. This had served to encourage a feeling of comradeship\r\nbetween the inhabitants of different communities. The population of\r\nthe country was doubling every twenty years, and groups previously\r\nisolated were coming into contact with one another. Interstate\r\nco÷peration was not only more necessary than ever before, but it was\r\nless difficult to bring about. Highways were being improved, and the\r\npostal service gradually extended, with the result that a more\r\nwholesome social life was made possible.\r\n\r\nIn an economic sense the American people were increasingly\r\ninterdependent. Especially on the frontier many communities were still\r\neconomically self-sufficing, but to an increasing extent the\r\ndevelopment of commerce and manufacturing was everywhere calling for a\r\ncloser co÷peration between various sections of the country. The\r\nAnnapolis Convention of 1786, indeed, was called for the purpose of\r\npromoting commercial co÷peration among the states. According to\r\nProfessor Beard, the formation of the Federal Constitution itself may\r\nin large measure be traced to the desire throughout the country for\r\ninterstate co÷peration in industry and commerce.\r\n\r\n30. AMERICAN DEMOCRACY IN 1787.--The constitutional convention of 1787\r\nexpanded American democracy from a local idea to a political concept\r\nof national proportions. But though this was an important step\r\nforward, American democracy had not yet been fully developed.\r\nReligious freedom, indeed, had been guaranteed by the Constitution,\r\nbut the suffrage was still narrowly restricted. The adoption of the\r\nConstitution was due primarily to negative forces; the full\r\ndevelopment of the positive forces, upon which the ultimate integrity\r\nof the union rests, was to be delayed for almost a century. The states\r\ntechnically abandoned state sovereignty when they accepted the\r\nConstitution of 1787, but not until the Civil War had been won was\r\npermanent union assured. Most important of all, American democracy was\r\nin 1787 only a political concept. There was at that time no suspicion\r\nthat democracy was later to be expanded into a philosophy of life,\r\napplicable not only to purely governmental affairs, but to the\r\nindividual in his economic and social relations as well.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS ON THE TEXT\r\n\r\n1.

THE AIM OF THIS CHAPTER.--The form of government established in\r\nthis country by the Constitution of 1787 is known as a republic. A\r\nrepublic may be defined as a representative democracy, or, in the\r\npopular sense of the term, simply as a democracy. Now, to point out\r\nthat a government is democratic does not necessarily mean that it is a\r\nsound government. Granting that self-government is morally right, the\r\nfate of a democracy will depend, partly upon the character of the\r\npeople, and partly upon the nature of the governmental machinery\r\nthrough which that people expresses its will. The proof of democracy\r\nis in its workings. The aim of this chapter is not to pass judgment\r\nupon democracy, but rather to outline the essential characteristics of\r\nAmerican constitutional government. When this background has been\r\nsecured we shall be in a position to begin a detailed study of applied\r\ndemocracy, to point out its merits, to call attention to its defects,\r\nand to consider how and to what extent it may be improved.\r\n\r\n32. STRENGTH.--American constitutional government is a strong\r\ngovernment. The weaknesses of the Articles of Confederation were\r\navoided in framing the Constitution of 1787. Whereas the Confederation\r\ngovernment was really headless, the Constitution of 1787 provided for\r\na strong executive. The Confederation Congress could not levy taxes,\r\nbut the Congress of the United States has adequate powers in this\r\nregard. There can be no recurrence of one of the chief financial\r\ntroubles of the Revolutionary period, for at the present time the\r\nseveral states may neither coin money nor emit bills of credit. The\r\nFederal government has exclusive control of foreign affairs, so that\r\nno state may individually enter into any agreement with a foreign\r\npower. The Federal Constitution is the supreme law of the land, and no\r\nstate action may contradict it. Unity has given us strength, and great\r\ncrises, such as the Civil War and the World War, have ended by\r\nincreasing that strength.\r\n\r\n33. THE CHECK AND BALANCE SYSTEM.--A striking characteristic feature\r\nof American constitutional government is the check and balance system.\r\nBy this system we mean all those constitutional provisions which\r\ndivide and subdivide governmental power among various sets of public\r\nagents. [Footnote: For a fuller discussion of the check and balance\r\nsystem see Chapter XXXIX.]\r\n\r\nThis division of powers is threefold. First, there is a division of\r\npower between the Federal government and the governments of the\r\nseveral states. The states are obliged to act in concert on most\r\nquestions involving the nation as a whole, but the Federal\r\nConstitution safeguards the rights of the states by reserving to them\r\nall powers not specifically delegated to the Federal government.\r\nSecond, in both Federal and state governments, power is still further\r\ndistributed among the executive, legislative, and judicial branches in\r\nsuch a way that each branch constitutes a check upon the other two.\r\nThird, in both Federal and state governments there is a division of\r\npower within each of the three branches of government. Thus both the\r\nPresident of the United States and the governors of the various states\r\nare at least partially controlled by subordinate executive officials,\r\nwhile in the legislative branch of both Federal and state governments\r\nthe upper and lower houses constitute a check upon one another. In the\r\ncase of both Federal and state judicial systems there is a division of\r\njurisdiction.\r\n\r\n34. THE CHECK AND BALANCE SYSTEM SECURES STABILITY.--American\r\ngovernment is not only strong, it is stable. This stability is due\r\nchiefly to the admirable way in which different governmental agents\r\nare balanced against one another. The check and balance system renders\r\nus safe from the danger of anarchy, for though ultimate control is\r\nvested in the people, sufficient powers are entrusted to the\r\ngovernmental mechanism to protect it against popular passion. The\r\nsystem likewise protects us against despotism. So long as the\r\nConstitution endures, neither the Federal government nor the\r\ngovernments of the states may destroy each other. The undue\r\nconcentration of political power is likewise rendered difficult by the\r\ndivision of power between the legislative, executive, and judicial\r\nbranches of both Federal and state governments.\r\n\r\nThe significance of a properly applied check and balance system\r\nappears clearly when we compare our government with that of various\r\nother republics. In many of the ancient republics, for example, the\r\npowers of government were so unequally and so indefinitely divided\r\nthat republican government degenerated either to despotism or to\r\nanarchy. Within the last century many Latin-American republics have\r\nmodeled their governments after ours, and yet some of these republics\r\nare constantly threatened by either revolution or despotism. The\r\nexplanation of this, according to Elihu Root, is that these republics\r\nhave adapted our check and balance system so carelessly that they find\r\nit difficult, if not impossible, to maintain a really stable\r\ngovernment. [Footnote: Here we are pointing out the fundamental merits\r\nof the check and balance system; later (Chapters XXXIV, XXXV, and\r\nXXXVI) we shall have occasion to notice some of the disadvantages of\r\nthis system.]\r\n\r\n35. THE RIGHTS OF THE INDIVIDUAL.--We have not purchased strength and\r\nstability at the expense of personal freedom, for both Federal and\r\nstate constitutions specifically safeguard the rights of the\r\nindividual. The fundamental guarantees set forth in the Magna Charta,\r\nthe Petition of Right, and the Bill of Rights were cherished by the\r\nAmerican colonists, and in 1791 they formed the basis of the first ten\r\nAmendments to the Federal Constitution. Provisions similarly designed\r\nto safeguard individual rights are found in the constitution of every\r\nstate in the Union. [Footnote: For an enumeration of these rights, see\r\nthe first ten Amendments to the Federal Constitution, Appendix.\r\nConsult also the Bill of Rights in the constitution of your state.]\r\nFrom the beginning of our national history a fundamental principle of\r\nAmerican government has been to allow the individual as much freedom\r\nof thought and action as is compatible with the general welfare.\r\n\r\n36. CONTROL BY THE PEOPLE.--Under American constitutional government,\r\nsovereignty resides with the people as a whole, though the people act\r\nthrough their chosen representatives. There is no power in American\r\ngovernment beyond that created or permitted by the people themselves.\r\nThe suffrage, so narrowly restricted in the eighteenth century, has\r\nsince widened to include the great majority of adults, both male and\r\nfemale. Elections are frequent, so that ill-chosen officials may not\r\nlong abuse their position. The Initiative, the Referendum and the\r\nRecall are methods of popular control which in many sections are\r\nspreading. Constitutional amendment in the United States is not easy;\r\non the other hand, if any considerable percentage of the voters evince\r\na sustained desire for change, an amendment is the normal\r\nresult. [Footnote: In Part IV of the text we shall consider the\r\ndangers of an over-extension of popular control; here it is only\r\nnecessary to point out that American government is essentially\r\ngovernment by the people.]\r\n\r\n37. EFFICIENCY.--The division of functions between the Federal and\r\nstate governments on the one hand, and between state and local\r\ngovernments on the other, provides a solid foundation for the\r\neconomical administration of government.\r\n\r\nThe Federal government attends to most matters which are of national\r\nimportance, and which cannot properly be looked after by the states\r\nindividually. For example, foreign relations, the postal service, and\r\nthe coinage of money, are Federal functions. The separation of Federal\r\nand state functions is not always clear, but such matters as\r\ncontracts, property rights, crime, and education are probably best\r\nadministered by the state. There is, similarly, no sharp dividing line\r\nbetween the functions of state and local governments, but at present\r\nit appears that the local authorities are the most efficient\r\nadministrators of roads and bridges, water and paving, the elementary\r\nschools, and similar concerns.\r\n\r\nThe essential economy of this threefold division of functions is that\r\neach of the three sets of officials tends to concern itself with those\r\nmatters with which it is best acquainted, and which are most\r\nadvantageously administered by it.\r\n\r\n38. UNITY.--The earlier European critics of our government declared\r\nthat the division of powers between Federal and state governments\r\nwould encourage civil strife. It is true that this division of powers\r\nhas resulted in a decentralized rather than in a centralized form of\r\ngovernment. It is equally true that the quarrel over states' rights\r\nwas the fundamental cause of the Civil War. But that war settled the\r\nquestion of states' rights once and for all, and there has never again\r\nbeen any serious question as to the proper status of states and Union.\r\nAmerican democracy has been found compatible with unity.\r\n\r\nNor has the decentralized character of American government kept us\r\nfrom presenting a united front in foreign wars. The concentration of\r\nwar powers in the hands of President Lincoln during the Civil War was\r\nmatched by the temporary dictatorship wielded by President Wilson\r\nduring the World War. In both cases, the national executive became,\r\nfor the period of the emergency, as powerful and as efficient as the\r\nexecutive of a highly centralized monarchy. This ability to exhibit\r\nunity of control and singleness of purpose in war-time enables us to\r\nclaim for our form of government one of the most important assets of\r\nthe centralized monarchy.\r\n\r\n39. THE SPIRIT OF PROGRESS.--Certainly one test of good government is\r\nthe extent to which it renders the masses of the people happy and\r\nprosperous. American government has not yet exhausted the\r\npossibilities of helpfulness, but one of the chief aims of our\r\npolitical system is to encourage the individual in every pursuit which\r\nis legal and honorable. Lord Bryce has called America the land of\r\nHope, because in spite of the defects of American government, a\r\nfeeling of buoyancy and optimism is characteristic of our political\r\ninstitutions. America might also be called the land of Sane Endeavor,\r\nfor we lend force and justification to our optimism by consistently\r\nworking for the attainment of our ideals. To improve every condition\r\nof American life, and yet to work in harmony with the principles of\r\nconstitutional government, that is our ideal. Progress must come\r\nthrough authorized channels, for, as Abraham Lincoln has said, \"a\r\nmajority, held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations,\r\nand always changing with the deliberate changes of popular opinion and\r\nsentiment, is the only true sovereign of a free people, and whoever\r\nrejects it does of necessity fly to anarchy or despotism.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS ON THE TEXT\r\n\r\n1.

NO GOVERNMENT IS PERFECT.--All government is a compromise, in that\r\nit is adopted or created for the purpose of harmonizing the interests\r\nof the individual with the interests of the group. The types of\r\ngovernment are numerous, varying with the character of the group, and\r\nwith the particular conditions under which it exists. But we know of\r\nno government which is perfect: all have shortcomings, some very\r\nserious, others less so. There is nothing to be gained, therefore, by\r\ndebating whether or not American government is imperfect. A much more\r\nprofitable question is this: What are the faults of American\r\ndemocracy, and how may they be eliminated or minimized? The most\r\nconstructive work which the American citizen is called upon to do is\r\nto grasp the character of the problems confronting his country, and\r\nthen to attempt their solution.\r\n\r\n41. THE WIDENING CIRCLE OF PROBLEMS.--The last two centuries have\r\nconstituted an age of rapid change and development in all of the major\r\nphases of civilization. There have been rapid shifts in population,\r\nparticularly in the younger countries of the world. Important\r\ndiscoveries have greatly increased our knowledge of natural science;\r\nepoch-making inventions have revolutionized manufacturing, commerce\r\nand transportation. In every civilized land there have been\r\nreadjustments of political beliefs, as well as important changes in\r\nintellectual, religious, and social standards. Such an age is\r\npeculiarly an age of problems: it is a period of change and stress, a\r\ntime of readjustment, of adaptation to changed conditions, of growth,\r\nand of development.\r\n\r\nWe in America are confronted by an ever widening circle of problems,\r\nand this chiefly for two reasons. In the first place, we have felt the\r\nimpact of those forces which for the last two centuries have been\r\ncreating problems the world over. In the second place, the whole\r\nperiod of our national development has fallen within this age of\r\nchange and readjustment This means that we have had to grapple with\r\nthe problems common to all modern countries during a period in which\r\nthe origin and development of American democracy have been creating\r\npurely domestic problems. These facts at least partially explain the\r\ngrowing importance of the problems of American democracy during the\r\npast century.\r\n\r\n42. EFFECT OF AN ENLARGED SOCIAL CONSCIENCE.--Many of the issues of\r\ncontemporary American life have come into prominence because we have\r\nenlarged the concept of democracy within the last century. The term\r\ndemocracy has come to imply, not merely a form of government, but\r\nactually a philosophy of life stressing justice and happiness for the\r\nindividual, whether in his political, social, or economic capacity.\r\nThe more humanitarian our view, the more situations calling for remedy\r\nfall within it. Child labor, to give a single example, was not\r\ngenerally considered an evil a century ago, but to-day an enlarged\r\nsocial conscience condemns it.\r\n\r\n43. NECESSITY OF AVOIDING PATERNALISM.--The solution of many national\r\nproblems implies an extension of government control. Now, it is not\r\ngenerally appreciated that while an enlarged social conscience has\r\nincreased the number of our problems, the individualistic strain in\r\nthe American nature resists that paternalism which at present appears\r\nnecessary to an effective treatment of certain problems. We are behind\r\nGermany in legislation designed to prevent industrial accidents,\r\nlessen the evils of unemployment, and otherwise protect the worker\r\nagainst the risks of industry. But Germany has built up this system of\r\nsocial insurance by restricting personal liberty, and by greatly\r\nextending the power of government over the individual. The great task\r\nconfronting our government is to do as much for the individual as any\r\npaternalistic government, without endangering his rights by an undue\r\nextension of governmental control.\r\n\r\n44. THE COMPLEXITY OF OUR PROBLEMS.--The mistake is sometimes made of\r\nthinking that national issues can be nicely defined, and separated\r\nfrom one another. The human mind has its limitations, and we are prone\r\nto emphasize the outline and content of particular problems in order\r\nto perceive their essential character the more clearly. But though\r\nthis is permissible for purposes of study, we must bear in mind that\r\nthe questions which we are to discuss are connected with one another\r\nin a most baffling way. To understand the administration of charity,\r\nfor example, we ought to know the social, economic, and political\r\nbackground of the community under observation. The thorough study of\r\nthis background would lead us to crime, education and other problems,\r\nwhich in turn have their connections with issues still further removed\r\nfrom the immediate problem of charity. The thorough understanding of a\r\nspecific question thus implies consideration of many inter-related\r\nquestions. Likewise, the solution of a particular question affects and\r\nis affected by the whole mass of related phenomena.\r\n\r\n45. IMPORTANCE OF THE ECONOMIC BACKGROUND.--It would be unwise,\r\nperhaps, to claim that any definite group of problems is of greater\r\nimportance than any other group. But at least we may say that some\r\nproblems are primary in origin, while others appear to be secondary,\r\n_i.e._ derived from those called primary. In the chapters which\r\nfollow, the attempt has been made to arrange the groups of problems\r\nwith some regard to their primary or secondary origin. Probably the\r\nmost fundamental problems which face us to-day are those of economic\r\norganization. Properly to understand these problems the student must\r\nfirst grasp the essential facts of American industry. We shall begin\r\nour study of the problems of American democracy, therefore, with a\r\nsurvey of the economic life of the nation. Only after we have mastered\r\nthe principles upon which American industry is based, shall we be in a\r\nposition to solve the problems which arise directly from the nature of\r\nour economic organization.\r\n\r\n46. INDUSTRIAL REFORM.--Our industrial life is so clearly based upon\r\ncertain fundamental institutions, such as private property, free\r\ncontract, and free competition, that an industrial \"system\" is said to\r\nexist. Certain great evils, notably poverty, have accompanied the\r\ndevelopment of this system. We shall discuss a number of programs\r\ndesigned to eliminate these evils. The doctrine of single tax is of\r\ninterest as advocating the abolition or confiscation of land value.\r\nThe co÷perative conduct of industry is of increasing importance of\r\nlate years. We must also reckon with socialism as a movement which\r\nseeks the redistribution of wealth. Under the general head of\r\nsocialism we shall have occasion to notice a small but active group\r\nknown as the Industrial Workers of the World, and the larger, though\r\nrelated, group which recently conducted a socialist experiment in\r\nRussia. The discussion of socialism completed, we shall sum up the\r\nattitude of American democracy toward the whole problem of industrial\r\nreform.\r\n\r\n47. SOCIAL PROBLEMS.--Of the social problems which grow out of a bad\r\neconomic situation, none is more vital than the fostering of peace and\r\ngood will between labor and capital. Following the discussion of\r\nindustrial relations, we shall have occasion to notice a whole series\r\nof social questions which have either been derived from, or\r\naccentuated by, the rapid industrialization of our country. Grave\r\nquestions arise in connection with immigration, health, and the\r\ncityward drift. The consideration of the problems of the city in turn\r\ndirects attention to the necessity of a normal rural life, and to the\r\nimportance of safeguarding the American home. Dependency is a familiar\r\nproblem, but one which, in the light of an awakened community spirit,\r\nis now being studied from new and interesting angles. Last among\r\nsocial problems is the fundamental matter of education. It is not too\r\nmuch to claim that the ultimate fate of American democracy depends, to\r\na great extent, upon the vigor and intelligence with which we improve\r\nand extend our educational system.\r\n\r\n48. RELATION OF GOVERNMENT TO BUSINESS.--Since our material well-being\r\nrests upon an economic basis, the public has a vital interest in\r\nbusiness. The rise of great corporations and the necessity of\r\nsafeguarding the public from monopolistic abuses make necessary a\r\ncareful examination into the relation of government to business. We\r\nshall meet with this question: Shall the government regulate, or\r\nactually own, businesses of vital importance to the public? Equally\r\nknotty, but fully as interesting, is the tariff question. Should\r\nCongress tax foreign goods entering this country, and, if so, upon\r\nwhat principles should this tax be determined? This will bring us to\r\nthe general problem of taxation, a subject to which the American\r\npeople will probably devote an increasing amount of attention in the\r\nnext few decades. The question of conserving our natural resources\r\nmust also be discussed. Last in this group of problems may be\r\nmentioned the question of money and banking. In discussing this\r\nimportant subject we shall notice, among other things, the interesting\r\nFederal reserve system, which, it is hoped, will protect us from\r\npanics in the future.\r\n\r\n49. PROBLEMS IN EFFECTIVE GOVERNMENT.--The economist has good reason\r\nfor declaring that the getting of a living is one of the most\r\nfundamental concerns in life; on the other hand, no people can long\r\nget a comfortable living without the aid of a helpful system of\r\ngovernment. Government must be made effective. This introduces us to\r\nanother series of problems. First of all, who shall share in\r\ngovernment? And how may we improve the methods by which we select the\r\nagents of government? How may corruption and inefficiency be\r\neliminated from American government? What is the significance of the\r\nInitiative, the Referendum, and the Recall?\r\n\r\nThese questions must prove of fascinating interest to those who think\r\nof democracy as a living institution which is constantly growing,\r\ndeveloping, adapting itself to changed conditions.\r\n\r\n50. WHAT IS THE PROMISE OF AMERICAN LIFE?--Rich in natural resources,\r\nample in extent, encouraging to man's helpful efforts, America\r\nfulfills the first condition of national greatness. Intelligent and\r\nindustrious, law-abiding and, devoted to the building of homes, our\r\npopulation fulfills the second condition.\r\n\r\nHere we have all the raw materials out of which to build a great\r\nnation. Already we have made marked contributions to civilization, and\r\nyet it should not be forgotten that our chief claim to national\r\ngreatness rests upon the promise which we show of being able to\r\nperfect American democracy.\r\n\r\nTo what extent will this promise actually be realized? As a nation we\r\nare yet young, as a people we have scarcely begun the greatest\r\nexperiment in democracy which the world has ever seen. Shall we\r\nendure, shall we attain to a half-success, shall we succeed\r\ngloriously?\r\n\r\nMuch depends upon the extent to which each of us assumes the\r\nresponsibilities of citizenship. Those who have gone before us\r\nconquered a wilderness, expanded and preserved the Union. But it is\r\nnot for us complacently to accept the result. Much has been done, but\r\nmuch more remains to be done. Our goal is the greatest possible\r\nperfection of our economic, social and political life. Each age may be\r\nsaid to have its peculiar burdens and responsibilities: the prime task\r\nof the colonist was to foster the tender shoot of democracy; that of\r\nthe western pioneer was to fashion homes out of a wilderness; the\r\nburden of our generation is to grapple with the present-day problems\r\nof American democracy. Without a high sense of personal\r\nresponsibility, coupled with an intelligent and consistent effort, we\r\ncan never reach the high goal admittedly possible.\r\n\r\n51. THE POINT OF VIEW IN PROBLEM STUDY.--To see American democracy and\r\nto see it as a whole should be our aim throughout the remainder of\r\nthis book. Now this is not easy. The danger is that the unwary student\r\nwill interpret the large amount of space devoted to \"problems\" as\r\nmeaning that American life is preeminently unsettled and defective.\r\nThis is a temptation to be guarded against. Though we shall uncover\r\nmany defects, it should be remembered that we are predominantly a\r\nnormal, healthy, prosperous people. But our virtues demand our\r\nattention less urgently than do our defects. If we seem to be\r\noverconcerned with the defects of American life, the student should\r\nnot conclude that American life is primarily defective. Rather, he\r\nought to realize that it is precisely because a situation involves a\r\nproblem that our attention is challenged.\r\n\r\nNor should problems be looked upon as something to be ashamed of.\r\nWhere life is dull and civilization static, there are relatively few\r\nproblems; where life is progressive and civilization steadily\r\nadvancing, problems are numerous and pressing. Problems imply\r\nadjustment, development, the desire for improvement and advancement.\r\nThey are signs of progress, the growing pains of civilization. If we\r\nbear this in mind, we shall be in a fair position to see American\r\ndemocracy in true perspective, without undue distortion of our\r\nviewpoint, and without prejudice to our judgment.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS ON THE TEXT\r\n\r\n1.

ECONOMICS OF AMERICAN INDUSTRY\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE NATURE OF AMERICAN INDUSTRY\r\n\r\n\r\n52. MAGNITUDE OF AMERICAN INDUSTRY.--In colonial times the major part\r\nof American industry was concentrated along the Atlantic seaboard; to-\r\nday it extends over a large part of the continent. A century and a\r\nhalf ago our industrial system was still a relatively simple one,\r\ngiving rise to few pressing problems of national importance; at the\r\npresent time it is a vast and complicated affair, closely bound up\r\nwith many of the most vital problems which confront American\r\ndemocracy. The activities which are commonly grouped under the head of\r\n\"American industry\" are so numerous and so varied that a description\r\nof all of them would carry us beyond the limits of this chapter.\r\nNevertheless, it is important that we secure some understanding of\r\nthese activities. A few pages may profitably be spent, therefore, in\r\ndiscussing certain basic facts of American industry.\r\n\r\n53. FAVORABLE LOCATION OF THE UNITED STATES.--Let us commence by\r\nnoting that the location of the United States is favorable to the\r\ndevelopment of industry. Of the two American continents, the northern\r\nhas the greater natural advantages. Each continent is roughly in the\r\nform of a triangle with the apex or smaller end pointing southward,\r\nbut whereas the larger end of the South American triangle is within\r\nthe tropic zone and only the tapering end is within the more favorable\r\ntemperate zone, the greater part of the North American triangle is\r\nwithin the temperate zone. With regard to location for world trade the\r\nnorthern continent again has the advantage: the ports of South America\r\nface a relatively empty ocean on the west and the little-developed\r\ncontinent of Africa on the east; the ports of North America, in\r\naddition to being more numerous and more suitable for commerce than\r\nthose of the southern continent, face the teeming Orient on the west,\r\nand the great markets of Europe on the east. Moreover, the United\r\nStates occupies the choicest portions of the North American continent.\r\nOur neighbor Canada has a cold and snow-bound frontier on her north,\r\nwhile on our south Mexico and the Central American countries lie near\r\nthe tropics. The heart of temperate America, on the other hand, is\r\nincluded within the territory of the United States.\r\n\r\n54. POPULATION.--Scarcely less important than the favorable location\r\nof the United States is the character of the people occupying the\r\ncountry. From less than four million in 1790, our population has\r\nincreased so rapidly that in 1920 there were 105,710,620 people within\r\nthe bounds of continental United States. As the population has\r\nincreased, it has spread over the Appalachians, into the great\r\nMississippi basin, and westward to the Pacific Ocean. Accompanying the\r\nincrease and westward spread of the population has come a greater\r\nvariety of racial types. Although our population was varied in\r\ncolonial times, the great majority of the settlers were from the\r\nBritish Isles and northwestern Europe. In the latter part of the\r\nnineteenth century immigration from northern Europe declined and more\r\nand more immigrants began to come from southern and southeastern\r\nEurope. So universal has been the attraction of America, that our\r\npresent population includes elements from every important country in\r\nthe world. From the industrial standpoint, the dominant\r\nCharacteristics of this composite American people are energy and\r\nversatility.\r\n\r\n55. NATIONAL WEALTH.--Generations of industrious people have helped to\r\nmake the United States the wealthiest nation in the world. It has been\r\nestimated that in 1850 our national wealth amounted to $8,000,000,000.\r\nBy 1900 the remarkable progress of American industry had increased\r\nthis figure to more than $88,000,000,000. In 1912 our wealth was\r\nprobably in excess of $180,000,000,000. Industrial and financial\r\ndisturbances during the period of the World War make later estimates\r\nhazardous, nevertheless it is interesting to note that in 1921 the\r\nwealth of the United States was estimated as being between\r\n$350,000,000,000 and $400,000,000,000. According to this estimate, the\r\nwealth of this country exceeded, in 1921, the combined wealth of Great\r\nBritain, France, Germany, Italy, and Belgium. In weighing the value of\r\nthis comparison, however, we must take into consideration the heavy\r\ndestruction of wealth in western Europe because of the World War.\r\n\r\n56. WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE DOING.--A large percentage of the\r\ninhabitants of the United States are engaged in some form of\r\nproductive work. According to the most recent estimates there are\r\napproximately fifty million persons, male and female, over ten years\r\nof age, engaged in gainful occupations in this country. Of these about\r\nfourteen million are engaged in agriculture and allied industries,\r\nwhile more than eleven million are busy in manufacturing pursuits.\r\nAlmost four million are found in some form of trade, and another four\r\nmillion are employed in domestic and personal service. Transportation,\r\nclerical work, and professional callings utilize the services of\r\nseveral additional million. The great majority of those employed in\r\nAmerican industry are men, although the number of women in industry is\r\nsteadily increasing. Children have been found in industrial pursuits\r\nsince colonial times, but of recent years there is a growing movement\r\nto restrict or prohibit the employment of children in gainful\r\noccupations.\r\n\r\n57. FORESTS AND MINERALS.--The natural resources of the United States\r\nplay a large part in our industrial life. One fourth of the territory\r\nof the United States is still covered with timber. We are abundantly\r\nsupplied with coal and iron, the two most important industrial\r\nminerals. Our coal deposits outrank, both in quantity and in quality,\r\nthose of any other country. Iron is found in most of the states in the\r\nUnion, the high-grade deposits of the Lake Superior area being of\r\nspecial importance. We produce more than half of the world's supply of\r\ncopper, which, after coal and iron, is the most important industrial\r\nmineral. Our supply of petroleum and natural gas is large, and in\r\nspite of the waste which has characterized our use of these important\r\ncommodities, our production of both is still great. Gold, silver,\r\nzinc, lead and phosphates are produced in the United States in large\r\nquantities. Indeed, we have ample supplies of practically all of the\r\nminerals of importance to industry, except platinum, tin, and nickel.\r\n\r\n58. AGRICULTURE.--Until very recently, at least, agriculture has been\r\nby far our most important industry. Of the two billion acres\r\ncomprising continental United States, approximately half are under\r\ncultivation. In most sections of the country the quality of the soil\r\nis good, and rainfall is ample. We have long led the world in the\r\nvalue of farm crops grown. Our production of wheat, corn, oats,\r\nbarley, rye, and dairy products totals an enormous figure. The steady\r\nenclosure of lands formerly used for grazing stock is restricting our\r\nproduction of food animals, but we are still important as a producer\r\nof meats. Most of the world's tobacco is grown in this country. The\r\nworld's supply of cotton is derived mainly from southern United\r\nStates. Finally, our soil is of such variety, and our climate so\r\ndiversified, that the danger of a general crop failure is slight. A\r\nloss in one part of the country is almost certain to be offset by good\r\ncrops in another.\r\n\r\n59. MANUFACTURING.--In colonial times American manufactures were\r\nsubjected to more or less restraint by Great Britain, but after the\r\nRevolution these industries entered upon a period of free and rapid\r\ndevelopment. Modern machinery was introduced rapidly after 1800, large\r\nscale production was developed, transportation was fostered, and\r\nlarger and larger markets were supplied with the products of American\r\nmanufacturers. Particularly since the Civil War has the importance of\r\nour manufactures increased. This increase has been due chiefly to the\r\nlarge scale production of foodstuffs, including meats and flour;\r\ntextiles; iron and steel products; shoes; chemicals; and agricultural\r\nmachinery. According to recent census figures it would appear that we\r\nare passing from a predominantly agricultural life to a stage in which\r\nmanufacturing is of relatively greater importance.\r\n\r\n60. TRANSPORTATION AND COMMUNICATION.--The physical geography of the\r\nUnited States encourages the development of adequate means of\r\ntransportation and communication. The St. Lawrence-Great Lakes system\r\ngives easy access to the most fertile section of the continent. The\r\nMississippi and its tributaries drain a million square miles of farm\r\nland. We have, in addition to 18,000 miles of navigable rivers, a\r\ngreater coast line available for commerce than has the whole of\r\nEurope. New York is the world's greatest seaport.\r\n\r\nFew mountain ranges hamper the development of transcontinental\r\nrailroads in this country, and of these only one, the Rockies, is a\r\nserious obstacle to effective transportation. Our railroad mileage is\r\nenormous, a half dozen transcontinental lines being supplemented by\r\nnumerous smaller roads and feeding lines. We have more than 2000 miles\r\nof canals in operation. Cheap and rapid transportation between the\r\ndifferent parts of the country, supplemented by adequate means of\r\ncommunication by telephone, telegraph, and the postal service,\r\nundoubtedly has been one of the greatest factors in our national\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\n61. DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN TRADE.--The great majority of our products\r\nare not shipped to foreign markets, but are utilized within the\r\ncountry. We are still so young and so undeveloped a country that our\r\nmanufacturers have been kept busy supplying the domestic market. This\r\nfact, together with the American manufacturer's lack of knowledge\r\nconcerning the possibilities of foreign trade, explains our neglect of\r\nforeign markets. In proportion as our manufacturers catch up with the\r\ndomestic market, and in proportion as their knowledge of foreign\r\nmarkets increases, it is likely that they will give more and more\r\nattention to customers in other countries.\r\n\r\nBut though a very small proportion of our products are sent abroad,\r\nthe foreign trade of the United States exceeds in value the foreign\r\ntrade of any other country. This predominance is due, not so much to\r\nour search for foreign markets, as to the steady demand in other\r\ncountries for three classes of goods in the production of which we\r\nhave a distinct advantage. These three classes of goods are, first,\r\nraw materials of which we have a great abundance, such as cotton and\r\ncopper; second, specialties invented and patented by Americans, such\r\nas inexpensive automobiles, typewriters, and phonographs; and, third,\r\ncommodities which may be advantageously produced by large-scale\r\nmethods, such as agricultural machinery and the cheaper grades of\r\ntextiles.\r\n\r\n62. SUMMARY AND FORECAST.--We have very briefly surveyed some of the\r\nbasic facts of American industry. On the one hand, the favorable\r\nlocation and the rich natural resources of the United States have\r\nfurnished a substantial basis for industrial progress. On the other\r\nhand, we must note that the American people are energetic and\r\nversatile,--combining, to a happy degree, the qualities of initiative\r\nand originality, perseverance and adaptability. The great wealth and\r\nprosperity of the country as a whole have been the result of the\r\ncombination of a favorable land and an able people.\r\n\r\nThis is not the whole of the story, of course. It must be admitted\r\nthat, with all of our wealth, we continue to face serious charges of\r\npoverty and industrial maladjustment. These charges are of great\r\nimportance, but it should be remembered that no problem can be solved,\r\nor even intelligently attacked, until the essential facts are well in\r\nhand. We have briefly described the nature of American industry. What\r\nwe have now to do, as a preliminary to considering the problem of\r\npoverty and industrial reform, is to analyze the economic laws in\r\naccordance with which American industry has developed. The essential\r\nfacts of the next four chapters cannot be weighed too carefully.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS ON THE TEXT\r\n\r\n1.

WHY MEN WORK.--Ultimately everyone depends upon work for his\r\nliving. Young children commonly live upon the earnings of their\r\nparents; most normal adults, on the other hand, depend upon their own\r\nefforts for their living. Since every individual probably works\r\nbecause of a combination of motives, it is possible somewhat to\r\nanalyze the reasons why men work. The most fundamental reason for\r\nworking is in order to preserve one's life. This assured, the\r\nindividual is in a position to work in order to preserve the lives of\r\nthose who are near and dear to him. When the necessities of life have\r\nbeen provided, work is commonly continued for the sake of acquiring\r\ncomforts or luxuries.\r\n\r\nUnder a well-regulated legal system these efforts of the individual\r\nalso benefit the community, but until he is able to support himself\r\nand his family, the average individual does not consciously make the\r\npublic interest the chief end of his labors. However altruistic a man\r\nmay be, he will not be able to labor consistently in behalf of others,\r\nunless he will thereby serve his own interests as well, or unless his\r\npersonal needs have already been met.\r\n\r\n64. THE OLD WAY OF GETTING A LIVING.--The economic history of\r\neighteenth century England illustrates two rather distinct methods of\r\ngetting a living, one of which may be called the old, and the other\r\nthe new. Up to about the middle of the century, the masses of\r\nEnglishmen, in common with the people of other countries, got a very\r\npoor living. Most common necessities were made in the home and for\r\npurely family use. Shoes, clothing, tools, and similar articles were\r\nproduced laboriously and on a small scale. In comparison with\r\nindustrial conditions in the nineteenth century, there was at that\r\ntime little industrial co÷peration [Footnote: By co÷peration is here\r\nmeant simply the working together of different persons or groups of\r\npersons. Co÷peration in this sense is to be distinguished from\r\nco÷peration as discussed in Chapter XII.], little division of labor,\r\nlittle suspicion that men were, in spite of hard work engaged in for\r\nlong hours, getting a very poor living. The trouble was, partly, that\r\nmen had not yet fully realized the possibilities of helping one\r\nanother, and partly that they were ignorant of how to make Nature\r\nreally an efficient aid in getting them a living.\r\n\r\n65. THE NEW WAY OF GETTING A LIVING.--After the middle of the\r\neighteenth century the invention of a series of remarkable machines\r\nenabled Englishmen greatly to increase their productivity, first in\r\nthe manufacture of textiles, and later in numerous other industries.\r\nBy subdividing their labor more and more minutely, and by each\r\nspecializing in the particular type of work which he could do best,\r\nmen found that their total output could be greatly increased. This\r\ncomplex division of labor, made possible by the use of water and steam\r\npower to run machines and to move vehicles of transportation, reduced\r\nthe difficulty of getting a good living, that it constituted a\r\nveritable revolution in industry. Indeed, this change is known in\r\nhistory as the Industrial Revolution.\r\n\r\n66. EFFECTS OF THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION.--In the last century and a\r\nhalf the Industrial Revolution has spread to every important civilized\r\ncountry in the world, everywhere encouraging the application of\r\nmachine methods to more and more industries. This change from\r\nproduction on a small scale, and often by hand, to large-scale\r\nproduction in factories equipped with complex machines, has had\r\nimportant results. It has so increased our control over Nature that\r\neven the humblest workman of to-day enjoys many comforts denied kings\r\na few centuries ago. On the other hand, the Industrial Revolution has\r\ntended to create a numerous class which depends entirely upon wages,\r\nand to set off against this class an employing group which possesses\r\nand controls most of the income-producing equipment of industry. The\r\nsignificance of this last development will become clearer as we go\r\nalong.\r\n\r\n67. NATURE OF MODERN PRODUCTION.--In the study of modern production\r\ntwo fundamental facts confront us. The first is that the economist\r\ndoes not define production as merely the making of material objects.\r\nWe desire material objects only if they will satisfy our wants. Since,\r\nalso, the satisfaction of wants is the important thing, it is clear\r\nthat the performance of a service, such as teaching or painting, may\r\nbe more important than the manufacture of a material object which no\r\none wants. Production may thus be defined as the satisfaction of human\r\nwants. The manufacturer of a material object is productive only if\r\nthat object is wanted by someone; he who supplies personal or\r\nprofessional service is productive if that service satisfies the wants\r\nof someone.\r\n\r\nThe second fundamental fact which confronts the student of modern\r\nproduction is the complexity of our industrial system. Three hundred\r\nyears ago most of the commodities in daily use were made, either in\r\nthe home and by the family members, or by small groups of artisans\r\nworking together under relatively simple conditions. To-day production\r\nis a vast and complicated process. To the eye of the untrained\r\nobserver a great mass of factories, farms, railroads, mills, machines,\r\nships, and busy laborers appears without order and, often, without\r\npurpose. The task immediately before us is to analyze this mass, and\r\nto point out the nature of the various factors which contribute to the\r\nproductive power of a community.\r\n\r\n68. NATURE A FIRST FACTOR IN PRODUCTION.--Nature is defined by the\r\neconomist as inclusive of all of the materials and forces furnished in\r\nthe form of land and its products, oceans, lakes, rivers, rain,\r\nhumidity, and climate. Since Nature is rather a vague term, and since,\r\nalso, the economist looks upon land as the most important element in\r\nNature, we may lump together all of the materials and forces of Nature\r\nand apply the term \"land.\"\r\n\r\nTaken in this sense, land is clearly of great importance in\r\nproduction. We build houses and factories upon it, we use it as a\r\nbasis of transportation, we harness its motive power, and we make\r\nextensive use of the innumerable raw materials which it furnishes.\r\nWithout land there could be no production, in the sense in which the\r\neconomist understands the word.\r\n\r\n69. MAN'S LABOR A SECOND FACTOR IN PRODUCTION.--Something besides\r\nland, or Nature, is necessary before our wants can be satisfied.\r\nNature is often careless of our needs and desires. True, she offers us\r\nberries, coal, firewood, and many other commodities which are\r\npractically ready to use, but even these articles will not satisfy our\r\nwants unless we go to the trouble to secure possession of them. In an\r\nimportant sense Nature is passive, and if she is to furnish us with a\r\nliving, we must engage in labor. This labor may be mental or physical,\r\nthe important point being that it is effort undertaken to increase our\r\ncontrol over Nature. Savages are content to use products in\r\nsubstantially the form in which Nature provides them; civilized\r\npeoples work over the products of Nature until the utility or want-\r\nsatisfying power of those products has been greatly increased. Man's\r\nliving improves as he progresses from indolence to hard physical\r\nlabor, then from hard physical labor alone to a combination of\r\nphysical and mental labor intelligently directed.\r\n\r\n70. CAPITAL A THIRD FACTOR IN PRODUCTION.--Land to furnish raw\r\nmaterials, and man to make use of those materials,--what more is\r\nnecessary? Nothing else would be necessary if all of Nature's gifts\r\nwere readily accessible, and if man unaided could make the best use of\r\nthem. But Nature hides or disguises many of her treasures, and man is\r\nphysically weak. Hence he has hit upon the device of making tools to\r\nhelp him in his contest with Nature. During the period of the\r\nIndustrial Revolution many simple tools were supplanted by complicated\r\ndevices run by power and called engines and machines. To the economist\r\ntools and similar devices are a form of capital, capital being defined\r\nas inclusive of everything which man has created, or caused to be\r\ncreated, in order to help in further production. [Footnote: Land has\r\nnot been created by man but is a gift of Nature. Land, therefore, is\r\nnot a form of capital.]\r\n\r\nThe fashioning of hammers and saws, the construction of railways, and\r\nthe manufacture of machinery, all these operations create capital. The\r\nsystematic creation and use of capital is one of the distinguishing\r\nfeatures of modern civilization. The laborer alone can produce little;\r\naided by capital he can produce much. Capital is not important if one\r\nis willing to live like a savage; on the other hand, it is\r\nindispensable if one wishes to enjoy the benefits of civilization.\r\n\r\n71. COÍRDINATION A FOURTH FACTOR IN PRODUCTION.--Land, labor, and\r\ncapital are factors in production. Two hundred years ago nothing else\r\nwas essential to production. The average individual had his own land,\r\nproduced his own tools or capital, and relied chiefly or entirely upon\r\nhis own labor.\r\n\r\nBut the Industrial Revolution enlarged and complicated production. It\r\ncreated an industrial system in which the individual is generally a\r\nspecialist, producing a surplus of his one product, but dependent upon\r\nnumerous other persons for most of the things which he personally\r\nconsumes. To-day, for example, there are numerous individuals raising\r\ncattle, the hides of which are to be made into shoes; other\r\nindividuals are perfecting means of transportation so that those hides\r\nmay be carried to market; still other persons concern themselves only\r\nwith the building of factories or with the manufacture of machines\r\nwith which to work those hides into shoes. These various individuals\r\nand groups may never see each other, nevertheless they aid one\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nThe secret of this often unseen and unconscious co÷peration is that\r\nthere are individuals who specialize in the work of connecting up, or\r\nco÷rdinating, the other factors which are necessary to the production\r\nof shoes. These individuals, about whom we shall have more to say in\r\nthe next chapter, constitute an important economic group. They\r\nco÷rdinate, in the example given above, the cattle grower, the\r\nrailroad manager, the tanner, the factory builder, and the\r\nmanufacturer, and thus make possible a kind of national or even\r\ninternational co÷peration which would otherwise be impossible. Those\r\nwhose function it is to promote this co÷peration are, therefore,\r\nindispensable factors in modern production.\r\n\r\n72. GOVERNMENT A FIFTH FACTOR IN PRODUCTION.--A cursory examination of\r\nmodern industry would convince the observer that land, labor, capital,\r\nand co÷rdination are important factors in production. There is, in\r\naddition, a factor which is so fundamental, and of such essential\r\nvalue, that it is sometimes overlooked altogether. This is the work of\r\nthe government in protecting productive enterprises. Government aids\r\nin production by suppressing theft, violence, and fraud; by allowing\r\nindividuals to engage in helpful businesses; by enforcing contracts\r\nentered into legally; and by punishing many kinds of monopolistic\r\nabuses. [Footnote: We shall take up the problem of monopoly in\r\nChapters XXVII and XXVIII.] The whole fabric of American prosperity is\r\nbuilt upon the foundation of law and order.\r\n\r\n73. SUMMARY AND FORECAST.--Production in the economic sense consists\r\nin doing that which will satisfy human wants. Modern production is a\r\nvast and complicated process, involving the co÷peration of five\r\nfactors: land, labor, capital, co÷rdination, and government. In a\r\nlater chapter we shall find that there are wide differences of opinion\r\nas to the relative importance of some of these factors. We shall find,\r\nindeed, that the most vital economic problems which confront American\r\ndemocracy depend for their solution upon a clear understanding of the\r\nfacts stated or implied in this chapter. The student ought not,\r\ntherefore, to accept hastily the statement that land, labor, capital,\r\nco÷rdination, and government are necessary in production, but ought\r\nrather to reason out just how and why each is actually helpful in\r\nAmerican industry.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS ON THE TEXT\r\n\r\n1.

RELATION OF THE DIVISION OF LABOR TO EXCHANGE.--In the self-\r\nsufficing stage that existed in industry a few hundred years ago,\r\nthere was generally little necessity for the exchange of products.\r\nEach family produced most of the commodities which it needed, and\r\ndepended relatively little upon the products of persons outside the\r\nfamily circle.\r\n\r\nBut the complex division of labor which developed out of the\r\nIndustrial Revolution has made the exchange of products increasingly\r\nimportant. To-day the typical workman concentrates upon one particular\r\nkind of work, and is content to exchange a share of his earnings for\r\nthe numerous goods and services which he cannot supply for himself.\r\nExchange thus increases the total output of the community or nation by\r\npermitting individuals to specialize in those commodities which they\r\ncan produce most effectively.\r\n\r\n75. RELATION OF TRANSPORTATION AND COMMUNICATION TO EXCHANGE.--\r\nExchange is largely dependent upon transportation and communication.\r\nIn the United States, for example, not only do the individuals of a\r\nparticular community specialize in various types of work, but the\r\ndifferent sections of the country are devoted to the production of\r\nthose commodities for which they are best suited. Thus it is largely\r\ntrue that New England is best suited to manufacturing, the South to\r\nthe growing of cotton, and certain parts of the West to the production\r\nof lumber and foodstuffs. The suitability of a region to a particular\r\nclass of products is due, partly to location, partly to the nature of\r\nthe soil and the climate, and partly to the inclination and training\r\nof the people. But whatever its causes, this territorial division of\r\nlabor could not be carried out without an efficient system of\r\ntransportation and communication. Communication by mail, telephone,\r\nand telegraph is necessary to allow producers and consumers in\r\ndifferent parts of the country to keep in touch with one another.\r\nTransportation by land and water is necessary if the surplus products\r\nof one section are to be exchanged for the surplus products of other\r\nsections.\r\n\r\n76. TYPES OF COÍRDINATORS.--Those who perform the work of co÷rdination\r\nin industry are commonly referred to indiscriminately as business men,\r\nmiddlemen, or entrepreneurs. [Footnote: the term \"entrepreneur\" is\r\nawkward and little known, but no more satisfactory term is available.]\r\nThe meaning of these three terms is distinguished with difficulty, but\r\nto avoid confusion later on the essential character of each should be\r\npointed out here. The term business man is very wide, and is commonly\r\ninclusive of all who actively engage in any sort of business. The\r\nprimary function of the middleman is to act as a connecting link\r\nbetween various industrial enterprises. The entrepreneur, on the other\r\nhand, is primarily an individual who co÷rdinates land, labor, and\r\ncapital with the intention of initiating and conducting a business\r\nenterprise. In so far as he acts as a connecting link between other\r\nindustrial agents, the entrepreneur is a middleman, but the middleman\r\nis usually thought of as an individual who connects up existing\r\nbusinesses, rather than initiating a new enterprise. To the functions\r\nof the entrepreneur we shall return in the next chapter; here it is\r\nthe middleman proper who is our chief concern.\r\n\r\n77. IMPORTANCE OF THE MIDDLEMAN.--The chief stages of shoe manufacture\r\nmay serve to illustrate the great importance of the middleman in\r\nexchange. The middleman, anticipating a demand for beef and hides,\r\nconnects the cattle grower with the live-stock market. Still later it\r\nis a middleman who offers raw hides to the tanner, and who sees that\r\nthe wholesale leather merchant comes into business contact with the\r\ntanner. The banker or broker who connects the entrepreneur with the\r\nmoney with which to set up a shoe factory may be called a middleman,\r\nas may the individual who aids the entrepreneur in getting the\r\nrequired amounts of land and labor with which to start manufacturing.\r\nWhen, under the direction of the entrepreneur, the shoe has been\r\nmanufactured, it is often a middleman who connects the shoe wholesaler\r\nwith the finished product. The jobber who buys large quantities of\r\nshoes from the wholesaler and sells them to the retailer in small lots\r\nis a middleman. The advertising man whose description and pictorial\r\nrepresentation of the shoe causes the consumer to buy it of the\r\nretailer is also a middleman.\r\n\r\n78. NOT ALL MIDDLEMEN ARE SOCIALLY NECESSARY.--By co÷rdinating the\r\nwork of these various individuals, many of whom are themselves\r\nmiddlemen, the middlemen whom we have been describing allow the\r\ncommunity to secure the full benefit of the division of labor and of\r\nexchange. Where there exist just enough middlemen to co÷rdinate with\r\nmaximum efficiency the various industrial agents of a community, the\r\ncommunity gains. When, on the other hand, there are more middlemen at\r\nwork than are really needed to perform the work of industrial\r\nco÷rdination, the community loses. This loss is a double one: first,\r\nthe working energy of the superfluous middlemen is wasted, or at least\r\nis applied uneconomically; second, middlemen are paid, directly or\r\nindirectly, out of the product which they handle, so that the handling\r\nof a commodity by an unnecessarily large number of middlemen means\r\nhigher prices for the ultimate consumers of that commodity. [Footnote:\r\nThe existence of superfluous middlemen constitutes a grave problem, to\r\nwhich more and more attention is being given. Various aspects of this\r\nproblem are discussed in Chapters XII and XXV.]\r\n\r\n79. BARTER.--We have seen _what_ the middleman does; it remains to\r\npoint out _how,_ or by means of what mechanism, he performs his\r\nfunctions. When savages, and civilized peoples living under primitive\r\nconditions, wish to exchange their surplus goods, they generally\r\nresort to barter, _i.e.,_ they exchange one commodity directly for\r\nanother. Where the division of labor has been so little developed that\r\nthe goods to be exchanged are relatively few, this may work very well,\r\nbut in modern industry barter would be inexpedient, if not impossible.\r\nThe farmer who had a surplus of cattle and desired a piano might have\r\ngreat difficulty in finding a man who had a surplus piano and who also\r\ndesired cattle. Even though the farmer liked the piano in question,\r\nand even though the owner of the piano were pleased with the farmer's\r\ncattle, it might be impossible to measure the value of the piano in\r\nunits of cattle.\r\n\r\n80. NATURE AND FUNCTION OF MONEY.--To facilitate exchange civilized\r\npeoples make an extensive use of money. Money may be defined as\r\nanything that passes freely from hand to hand as a medium of\r\nexchange. [Footnote: The terms \"money\" and \"capital\" are often used\r\ninterchangeably. Strictly speaking, however, money is a form of\r\ncapital. Moreover, it is only _one_ form of capital] In modern times\r\ngold, silver, nickel, and copper coins have been the most familiar\r\nforms, though paper currency is also an important form of money. There\r\nis nothing mysterious about money: it is simply a means of\r\nfacilitating exchange by saving time and by guaranteeing accuracy in\r\nmeasuring the relative values of commodities.\r\n\r\nLet us see how money actually aids in the exchange, say, of cattle and\r\npianos. The farmer disposes of his cattle to a middleman, receiving in\r\nreturn money, the authenticity of which is guaranteed by the\r\ngovernment's stamp upon its face. There is no difficulty in making\r\nchange, for money can be so minutely divided as to measure the value\r\nof an article rather exactly. The farmer does not fear that he could\r\nnot use the money received for the cattle, for money is generally\r\naccepted in exchange for any commodity. The farmer now offers the\r\nmoney to the piano-owner, who is probably a middleman. Again the fact\r\nthat money is finely divisible allows an accurate money measure of the\r\nvalue of the piano. The owner of the piano, if he is satisfied with\r\nthe amount of money offered, does not hesitate to accept the farmer's\r\nmoney, since he, too, realizes that he can use the money to purchase\r\nthe things that he in turn desires.\r\n\r\n81. VALUE AND PRICE.--We have used the term \"value\" several times; as\r\npart of our preparation for the study of the great problem of\r\nindustrial reform, we must understand precisely what is meant by the\r\nterm.\r\n\r\nSuppose, for the sake of clearness, that we speak of a market as a\r\ndefinite place where goods are bought and sold. Individuals take or\r\nsend their surplus products to the market for sale; individuals\r\ndesiring to buy commodities likewise resort to the market. In the\r\nmarket commodities are said to have value, that is to say, they have\r\npower in exchange. The power of a commodity in exchange is measured in\r\nmoney, and the amount of money for which a commodity will exchange is\r\ncalled its price. Price is thus a measure, in terms of money, of the\r\nvalue of a commodity.\r\n\r\nThe value of a commodity in the market is dependent, partly upon its\r\nutility, or want-satisfying power; and partly upon its scarcity. In\r\nother words, the value of a commodity depends partly upon the\r\nintensity with which it is desired by persons able and willing to\r\npurchase it, and partly upon its available supply. Price is set as the\r\nresult of the interaction of the forces of supply and demand, this\r\ninteraction commonly taking the form of a bargaining process between\r\nprospective sellers and prospective buyers.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS ON THE TEXT\r\n\r\n1.

THE PROBLEM PRIOR TO THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION.--The distribution\r\nof industrial income has to do with dividing the products of industry,\r\nor the money which represents those products, among the various\r\nindividuals who have aided in their creation.\r\n\r\nThe problem of distribution has existed ever since men first combined\r\nfor purposes of production, but until the period of the Industrial\r\nRevolution the question was relatively unimportant. When, three\r\nhundred years ago, most necessities were produced within the family\r\ncircle, there was little or no question as to whether or not\r\nindividuals outside the family ought to be rewarded for having helped\r\nin the production of those commodities. If one member of the family\r\nmade an entire pair of shoes, for example, he was clearly entitled to\r\nthose shoes, at least so far as economic principles are concerned.\r\nEven where different members of the family combined to produce a pair\r\nof shoes or an article of clothing, the small number of persons\r\ninvolved, as well as the close identity of interests among the family\r\nmembers, kept the problem of distribution from becoming a serious one.\r\n\r\n83. EFFECT OF THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION UPON THE PROBLEM.--The\r\nIndustrial Revolution greatly increased the importance of the problem\r\nof distribution. Indeed, the growth of the factory system, and the\r\ngreater and greater complexity of the division of labor, have made the\r\ndistribution of industrial income the basic problem in our economic\r\nand social life. Many commodities are still produced by individuals\r\nworking independently, or by the joint efforts of the members of a\r\nfamily, but the vast majority of commodities are now produced by the\r\njoint efforts of numerous individuals who are not bound together by\r\nfamily ties. The production of a factory-made shoe, for example,\r\ninvolves large numbers of people, including the cattle grower, the\r\ntransportation agent, the tanner, numerous laborers, the individuals\r\nwho supply land and capital to the entrepreneur, and the entrepreneur\r\nwho conducts the enterprise. The welfare of millions of people is\r\ninvolved in the distribution of industrial income among individuals\r\nwho co÷perate in such enterprises as this.\r\n\r\n84. DIFFICULTY OF THE PROBLEM.--Under modern industrial conditions\r\nmost commodities are produced by the combined efforts of large numbers\r\nof people. All these people help along the productive process, though\r\nin different ways and to a varying degree. Since all help, all are\r\nentitled to payment. But this is less simple than it sounds. How shall\r\nwe determine how much each one helps, and how shall we decide how much\r\neach one is to receive?\r\n\r\nAt the outset of the discussion, we can be sure of at least one fact,\r\n_i.e._ that since all the individuals involved in a given enterprise\r\nmust be paid out of the value of the finished product, the combined\r\nsums received by them cannot long exceed the total value of that\r\nproduct. Unfortunately, this fact is often overlooked. Many of the\r\nindividuals who aid in production often become so intent upon securing\r\ntheir share, that they are over-ready to explain their contribution to\r\nthe product, but loath to give due credit to those who have co÷perated\r\nwith them. It is the belief that some individuals receive too little\r\nof the joint income of industry, while other individuals receive too\r\nlarge a share, which has given rise to the charge of injustice in the\r\ndistribution of wealth.\r\n\r\n85. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE ENTREPRENEUR IN DISTRIBUTION.--For the sake of\r\nclearness, let us continue to illustrate the nature of distribution by\r\nreference to the shoe industry, carried on under conditions which are\r\nnot unduly complicated.\r\n\r\nThe individual having control of the actual manufacture of the shoes\r\nis the entrepreneur. It is he who, in anticipation of a demand for\r\nshoes, has initiated the enterprise. Suppose, for the sake of\r\nsimplicity, that the entrepreneur has secured land from the land-\r\nowner, capital from the capitalist, and labor from the workmen.\r\nProtected in a legitimate enterprise by the government, he has set\r\nhimself up as a manufacturer of shoes. Since he is in control of the\r\nenterprise, it is he who pays the land-owner, the capitalist, and the\r\nlaborers, for their respective contributions toward the finished\r\nshoes.\r\n\r\nThe amounts received by the individuals co÷perating with the\r\nentrepreneur are not, however, arbitrarily determined. The\r\nentrepreneur must bow to economic law, and give these individuals what\r\nfree competition in industry sets as a proper reward for their\r\nrespective services. Let us examine into this conformity to economic\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\n86. THE LAND-OWNER RECEIVES RENT.--The land-owner is rewarded because\r\nhe extends the use of land to the entrepreneur. A land-owner could not\r\nbe expected to, and will not, allow the entrepreneur free use of this\r\nland. The land-owner must therefore be paid for the use of the land.\r\nThe entrepreneur, on the other hand, is able and willing to pay for\r\nthe use of the land because upon it he expects to build a factory in\r\nwhich to manufacture shoes. He therefore pays the land-owner an amount\r\nof money called rent. The amount of rent paid for a piece of land\r\ndepends partly upon how much the entrepreneur wants the land, and\r\npartly upon the available supply of land of the type wanted. This is\r\nequivalent to saying that rent is determined by the interaction of the\r\ntwo forces of supply and demand.\r\n\r\n87. THE CAPITALIST RECEIVES INTEREST.--Besides land, the entrepreneur\r\nneeds machinery, office equipment, raw materials, the services of\r\nlaborers, and numerous other aids in production. Let us assume that\r\nthe entrepreneur borrows of a capitalist the money required to procure\r\nthese necessities. The entrepreneur can afford to pay interest for the\r\nuse of this money, since with the aid of the goods and services which\r\nit will buy, he can produce more shoes than would otherwise be\r\npossible. Not only can he afford to pay interest, but he is obliged to\r\npay it, since otherwise he could not secure the required loan. Though\r\nsome people tend carelessly to overlook this fact, saving and\r\nabstinence are necessary to the accumulation of money. The individual\r\nwho has money, therefore, cannot be expected to allow the entrepreneur\r\nto use it without payment, especially not when, as we have just seen,\r\nthe entrepreneur can acquire wealth by the use of the goods and\r\nservices which that money will buy.\r\n\r\nThe amount of interest which the capitalist receives for the use of\r\nhis money will depend, as will rent, upon the law of supply and\r\ndemand. If there is a large amount of funds available for investment,\r\nand at the same time few borrowers, then a given capitalist must be\r\ncontent to accept a relatively low rate of interest, lest his refusal\r\ncause the entrepreneur to close a bargain with a competing capitalist.\r\nIf, on the other hand, available funds are scarce and entrepreneurs\r\nare greatly in need of money, then capitalists are at an advantage and\r\nentrepreneurs must offer relatively high rates of interest.\r\n\r\n88. THE LABORERS RECEIVE WAGES.--The payment which the laborers\r\nreceive for their part in the production of the shoes is called wages.\r\nSince the laborers help in shoe manufacture, the employer can afford\r\nto pay them. Not only can he afford to pay them, but he must pay them.\r\nOtherwise the laborers would not work for this particular\r\nentrepreneur, but, in a freely competitive market, would offer their\r\nservices to a competing employer.\r\n\r\nWages, like rent and interest, depend upon the conditions of supply\r\nand demand. If, in comparison with other aids in production, the\r\nservices of laborers are wanted badly, and if, at the same time, there\r\nis a scarcity of the desired type of labor, then wages will be high.\r\nIf, on the other hand, there is an over supply of laborers, and also a\r\nsmall demand for that type of labor, then wages will tend to be low.\r\n\r\n89. THE GOVERNMENT RECEIVES TAXES.--In addition to paying the land-\r\nowner, the capitalist, and the laborers for their share in producing\r\nthe shoes, the entrepreneur must pay taxes to the government. These\r\ntaxes may be considered as payment for that maintenance of law and\r\norder without which the economical manufacture of shoes would be\r\nimpossible. The share which goes to the government is determined by a\r\nunique method: the government does not try to secure as large a share\r\nof the product as possible, but strives, on the contrary, to exact as\r\nlittle as possible, and still meet its expenses. The subject of\r\ntaxation requires special treatment [Footnote: See Chapter XXXII.] and\r\ndoes not, therefore, call for further mention in this chapter.\r\n\r\n90. THE ENTREPRENEUR RECEIVES PROFITS.--That share of the income\r\nderived from the sale of the shoes which goes to the entrepreneur is\r\ncalled profits. It is only fair that the entrepreneur receive some\r\nreward, for it is he who conceived the idea of shoe manufacture and\r\nthen carried out the project. Without his efforts the land-owner, the\r\ncapitalist, and the laborers would not have combined in this\r\nenterprise, with the result that there would have been fewer shoes in\r\nthe community. Fewer shoes would probably mean more expensive shoes.\r\nAnd not only does the entrepreneur deserve some reward for thus adding\r\nto the well-being of the community, but if he did not receive that\r\nreward, he would not go to the trouble of initiating and maintaining a\r\nshoe manufacturing establishment.\r\n\r\nThe share going to the entrepreneur is determined less exactly than is\r\nthe share of the land-owner, the capitalist, and the laborers. In\r\ndividing up the income of the business, the shoe manufacturer must, in\r\nan important sense, put himself last. Before there are finished shoes\r\nto sell, he must pay the land-owner rent, the capitalist interest, and\r\nthe laborers wages. Before he is allowed to count out his own share he\r\nmust also pay taxes to the government, pay insurance on his plant, and\r\nset aside an amount sufficient to keep his buildings and machinery in\r\nrepair. He cannot evade the payment of rent, interest, or wages on the\r\nplea that these payments will diminish his profits. He has contracted\r\nto pay the landlord, the capitalist, and the laborers, and he must\r\nfulfill that contract. If, after paying all of his expenses, there is\r\nanything left, the entrepreneur retains it as profits. Sometimes this\r\nshare is very large, sometimes it is so small as to force the\r\nentrepreneur out of business. In any case, the chief risks and\r\nresponsibilities of the whole enterprise are concentrated upon the\r\nentrepreneur, rather than upon the land-owner, the capitalist, or the\r\nlaborers.\r\n\r\n91. THE DETERMINANTS OF EACH SHARE.--To sum up, the share of the joint\r\nindustrial income going respectively to the land-owner, the\r\ncapitalist, and the laborers is determined by the interaction of the\r\nforces of supply and demand, operating under conditions of free\r\ncompetition. The entrepreneur's demand for land, labor, or capital\r\nwill depend upon whether or not he sees an opportunity, under a\r\nparticular set of circumstances, to add to his product by the\r\nemployment of each or all of these factors. Where the supply of\r\nlaborers is large, relatively to demand, the promised product of any\r\none laborer is likely to be relatively small, and in this case the\r\nentrepreneur or employer will be unwilling or even unable to offer a\r\nparticular laborer high wages. Under these circumstances the\r\ncompetition of the many laborers for the few jobs will accordingly\r\nbring about lower wages. Where, on the other hand, the supply of\r\nlaborers is small, relatively to demand, the chances that a particular\r\nlaborer will be able to add to the product are relatively great, and\r\nthe competition of employers for laborers will result in higher wages.\r\nThe same reasoning is applicable to rent and interest. The automatic\r\noperation of the law of supply and demand, functioning in a freely\r\ncompetitive market, determines the shares which go to land, labor, and\r\ncapital. The share going to the individual entrepreneur is, as has\r\nalready been pointed out, a residual share, _i.e._ what is left over.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS ON THE TEXT\r\n\r\n1.

THE \"CAPITALISTIC SYSTEM.\"--Modern industry is sometimes said to\r\nbe headless, because the numerous individuals engaged in it are not\r\nsystematically controlled or directed by a single agency. It is often\r\nsaid to be planless, since laborers, employers, and other industrial\r\nagents concentrate upon their individual desires and needs, rather\r\nthan upon the needs of the community or nation as a whole.\r\n\r\nAnd yet there is in modern industry a certain regularity of outline,\r\nand a general tendency to follow the economic laws discussed in the\r\npreceding three chapters. This circumstance prevents us from\r\nconcluding that our industrial life is entirely a haphazard affair. It\r\nmay, indeed, be said that we have an industrial system. Because of the\r\ngreat importance in it of capital, this system is commonly known as\r\nthe \"capitalistic system.\" The underlying principles of this system\r\nhave already been mentioned or implied; nevertheless it will be to our\r\ninterest in this chapter to develop and organize these principles so\r\nas to indicate just how they constitute the bases of capitalism.\r\n\r\n93. ATTITUDE OF GOVERNMENT TOWARD INDUSTRY.--\"It is the duty of the\r\ngovernment,\" Gladstone once said, \"to make it easy for the people to\r\ndo right, and difficult for them to do wrong.\" According to the theory\r\nof the capitalistic system, that is \"right\" which renders the\r\nindividual and the community stronger, happier, and more prosperous in\r\nuseful pursuits, while that is \"wrong\" which weakens or demoralizes\r\nthe citizen and the community. The chief economic function of\r\ngovernment is thus to discourage men from harmful and destructive\r\nacts, and to encourage them in activities which are helpful and\r\nproductive.\r\n\r\nProfessor Carver points out that the method by which animals get their\r\nliving is either destructive, deceptive, persuasive, or productive.\r\nAny one of these four methods may at least temporarily increase the\r\nwell-being of the individual, but only the productive method is\r\ncertain to benefit the community as well. A good government will\r\ntherefore seek to prevent people from advancing their individual\r\ninterests by killing, robbing, or deceiving their fellows. This\r\nsuppression of violence and fraud leaves open to individuals only the\r\nproductive method of getting a living, so that they cannot benefit\r\nthemselves without at the same time adding to the prosperity of the\r\ncommunity. From the standpoint of capitalism, thus, a good government\r\nmaintains an attitude toward industry which is primarily negative:\r\nsuch a government hampers the economic activities of individuals very\r\nlittle or not at all, so long as they do not practice harmful methods\r\nof getting a living.\r\n\r\n94. PRIVATE PROPERTY.--Most men are self-centered. In even a highly\r\ndeveloped society, men ordinarily will not work consistently except in\r\ntheir own behalf, or in the behalf of a very few people for whom they\r\ncare intensely. This instinct of self-interest is the kernel of\r\nindustrial progress, but it can result in material prosperity only\r\nwhen government suppresses violence and fraud. The lowest savages are\r\nundoubtedly self-centered, but so long as they must rely upon brute\r\nforce to retain their possessions, there is little inducement to\r\nacquire wealth. It is only when law suppresses robbery and fraud, and\r\notherwise protects the individual in his property rights, that the\r\nacquisitive instinct will cause him to exert himself in productive\r\nways. Because it satisfies the individual's desire to secure the good\r\nthings of life, the institution of private property is the greatest\r\nknown spur to economic activity, It is only in those countries where\r\nindividuals are protected in their property rights that we find an\r\nactive, progressive, and prosperous people.\r\n\r\n95. ENFORCEMENT OF CONTRACTS.--We have already seen that among the\r\nmembers of a modern industrial society there is a high degree of\r\ninterdependence, corresponding, in an important sense, to the\r\ninterdependence between the parts of a machine. As we have seen, the\r\ntypical individual in industry is a specialist, concentrating upon one\r\nparticular kind of work, and depending upon his fellows to supply him\r\nwith goods and services which he cannot supply for himself. Now, such\r\na condition of interdependence could never have arisen were it not for\r\nthe fact that government fosters the spirit of confidence among\r\nindividuals. Many persons can be trusted to fulfill the agreements or\r\ncontracts which they make with their fellows, but many cannot. A prime\r\nfunction of government, therefore, is to enforce contracts entered\r\ninto voluntarily and in legal form. This is clearly essential to our\r\nmaterial prosperity, for if men are to rely upon the word of those who\r\nsell them goods or services, or to whom they sell goods or services,\r\nall of the individuals concerned must be dependable.\r\n\r\n96. COMPETITION.--A good government will shunt men into productive\r\nactivities, and it will insist upon the fulfilment of lawful\r\ncontracts. Subject to these two limitations, individuals are\r\nrelatively free to seek their own well-being. But an earmark of\r\neconomic goods is scarcity, that is, there are at a given time and\r\nplace fewer of them than are desired. Men must therefore compete with\r\none another for goods and services. The lower animals compete for food\r\nwith tooth and claw; among civilized men government tries to raise\r\ncompetition to an ethical plane by tending to suppress all but the\r\nproductive methods of competition.\r\n\r\nWhere competition is so restricted and safeguarded, advocates of\r\ncapitalism assert that the results are overwhelmingly good. Where\r\nthere is free competition, _i.e._ free competition in productive\r\nenterprise, employers commonly pay their laborers as high a wage as\r\nthey feel is justified under the particular circumstances, lest their\r\nworkmen abandon them for rival employers. Under similar conditions,\r\nlaborers will generally endeavor to render the best possible service,\r\nso that the employer will prefer them to other laborers. This assumes,\r\nof course, that competition is effective, _i.e.,_ that there is\r\nneither an oversupply or an undersupply of either employers or\r\nemployees.\r\n\r\nWhere, again, there is free competition in productive enterprise, the\r\nprice of commodities produced by a given concern cannot rise too far,\r\nfor consumers will either buy those commodities of rival producers, or\r\nwill use substitutes. If, on the other hand, prices drop so low that\r\nproducers make little or no profits, they will withdraw from business.\r\n\r\nFree and effective competition thus means rivalry in satisfying wants,\r\nthat rivalry being engaged in for the sake of private gain.\r\nCompetition tends to harmonize the interests of the individual with\r\nthe interests of the community, by making the success of the\r\nindividual depend primarily upon what he accomplishes for his fellows.\r\n\r\n97. VALUE UNDER CONDITIONS OF FREE COMPETITION.--In a competitive\r\nmarket, as we have seen, value depends upon scarcity and utility. No\r\none will ordinarily pay for a commodity unless it will satisfy his\r\nwants, i.e. unless it has utility. But even though a commodity has\r\nutility, no one will ordinarily pay for it unless it is so scarce that\r\nhe cannot get as much of it as he wishes without paying for it. Air,\r\nfor example, has great utility, but it is so abundant that it can\r\nordinarily be secured without payment. Hence it has no value.\r\n\r\nPrice, the measure of value in terms of money, will be determined,\r\nunder conditions of free competition, by the interaction of utility\r\nand scarcity. Diamonds are high in price because they satisfy intense\r\ndesires and are scarce; bread is cheap because while possessing great\r\nutility, it is relatively abundant. Skilled labor receives high wages\r\nbecause in addition to its utility it is relatively scarce; unskilled\r\nlabor often receives low wages because while possessing utility it is\r\nrelatively abundant. This principle is of the very greatest\r\nconsequence, and in considering the programs of industrial reform we\r\nshall come back to it again.\r\n\r\n98. FREEDOM.--A large measure of personal liberty is a characteristic\r\nof the capitalistic system, To an increasing extent, government is\r\nrestricting economic activity to productive channels, but with this\r\nqualification, the individual is comparatively free to do as he likes.\r\nThe laborer is free to move about in search of work, free to seek a\r\nbetter job, free to accept or to reject work offered him. He may\r\nabandon his job when he chooses, and remain idle as long as he\r\nchooses, or is able. He is repressed by no paternalistic government,\r\nembarrassed by no feudal system. He is part and parcel of the\r\ncompetitive system, guiding his own actions and accepting\r\nresponsibility for them. To a large extent, the employer is similarly\r\nfree to hire or discharge men as he sees fit, to initiate a new\r\nbusiness, or to withdraw from business altogether. In every case the\r\nindividual is free, so far as legal restrictions are concerned, to use\r\nhis money as he chooses. Whether it is hoarded, invested, or wasted is\r\nlargely a matter for him to determine.\r\n\r\n99. BENEFITS OF THE CAPITALISTIC SYSTEM.--The material prosperity of\r\nthe modern world has been attained under the capitalistic system of\r\nindustry. The system was not invented, but has developed and spread\r\nfrom small beginnings because the experience of centuries has proved\r\nit to be the best known system which is applicable to human industry.\r\nThe starting point of all material prosperity has been the gradual\r\ndevelopment of government which suppresses violence and fraud, which\r\nenforces contracts, and which makes possible the rise of the\r\ninstitution of private property. The inception of the Industrial\r\nRevolution, and its spread beyond England to Europe, America, and,\r\nlater, to Asia, were possible only because these bases of capitalism\r\nwere already laid. To a large extent, thus, the steam engine, the\r\nrailroad, the steamship, the electric light, and countless other\r\ninventions which have helped to revolutionize the world we live in,\r\nmay be traced directly or indirectly to individual freedom and to the\r\nprotection of property rights. In so far as science, art, and\r\nliterature depend, to a considerable degree, upon material prosperity,\r\nwe may go so far as to say that capitalism is the most important\r\nsingle basis of modern civilization.\r\n\r\n100. DEFECTS OF THE CAPITALISTIC SYSTEM.--But capitalism is not\r\nwithout its defects. The lack of centralized control in industry\r\nallows of planless production. [Footnote: During our participation in\r\nthe World War, it is largely true that much of the productive energy\r\nof the country was organized and directed as a unit. This was a\r\ntemporary expedient, however, resorted to for the purpose of winning\r\nthe war.] Entrepreneurs frequently produce without adequate knowledge\r\nof demand, and without knowledge of rival production. When business is\r\nbooming and profits are high, it often happens that so many\r\nindividuals go into business that eventually there is over-production,\r\ni.e. there are more goods at a particular time than can be sold at a\r\nprofit. Crises, unemployment, and \"hard times\" are often the direct\r\nresult of this over-production. Malnutrition, disease, vice, crime,\r\nand pauperism are often its indirect results.\r\n\r\nIn still other ways the capitalistic system allows of an uneconomical\r\nexpenditure of labor and capital. There is no adequate method of\r\ndirecting labor and capital toward the production of durable and\r\nhelpful commodities, and away from the production of luxuries and such\r\nharmful commodities as have not been made illegal. Under competitive\r\nconditions, too, a number of shops or stores may exist in a community\r\nthat might easily be served by a single firm. This is wasteful\r\nduplication, just as advertising is a waste when it goes beyond the\r\npoint of informing the public as to whereabouts and character of\r\ncommodities. Still another source of waste is traceable to an\r\nexcessive number of middlemen, each of whom adds to the price of the\r\nproduct as it passes through his hands.\r\n\r\n101. THE INEQUALITY OF WEALTH.--In all of the great industrial\r\ncountries of the world, including the United States, the existing\r\ndistribution of wealth is roughly in the form of a pyramid, i.e., at\r\nthe top or apex of the pyramid there is a relatively small number of\r\npersons who enjoy large incomes, while at the base there is a large\r\nnumber with relatively small incomes. This inequality is explained by\r\nProfessor Taussig on two grounds: First, it is likely that some\r\nindividuals originally secured an economic advantage over their\r\nfellows because of inborn superiority of some kind. Second, the\r\neconomic advantage thus secured has been maintained from generation to\r\ngeneration by inheritance. Where, for example, wealth is invested so\r\nthat the principal remains intact while a large annual income is\r\nthrown off as interest, the heirs may live in affluence, regardless of\r\nability or desert. Thus we have a leisure class emerging as the result\r\nof inborn differences between men, supplemented by the accumulation of\r\nwealth and its transmission by inheritance.\r\n\r\n102. THE QUESTION OF INDUSTRIAL REFORM.--It goes without saying that\r\ngreat inequalities in the distribution of wealth are undesirable. If\r\nany improvement is humanly possible, we ought not to rest content so\r\nlong as millions of our citizens have too few of the good things of\r\nlife, while others have much more than is necessary for comfort and\r\nhappiness. The test of an economic system is whether or not it\r\nprovides a good world to live in, and so long as large numbers of\r\nindividuals have fewer necessities and comforts than it is possible to\r\ngive them, our economic system must be considered defective. The\r\npeople as a group are both the means and the end of progress.\r\nDemocracy cannot rest upon any other basis than the greatest good to\r\nthe greatest number.\r\n\r\n103. APPROACHING THE PROBLEM.--In approaching the problem of\r\nindustrial reform it is necessary to cultivate a fair and sane\r\nattitude. We must attack all of the problems of American democracy,\r\ncertainly. But in so far as some of these problems involve the\r\nintegrity of the capitalistic system, we should distinguish between\r\nills which are clearly traceable to that system, and defects which\r\nobviously would exist under any industrial system. Capitalism cannot\r\nbe discredited, for example, by pointing out that crime exists in all\r\ncapitalistic countries. Though capitalism may accentuate some types of\r\ncrime, our knowledge of human nature leads us to suspect that a\r\nconsiderable amount of crime would exist under any known system of\r\nindustry. Again, criticism should be constructive; it is easy to point\r\nout the defects of an institution, but it is quite another thing to\r\nprovide a good substitute for that institution.\r\n\r\nThe problem before us is a double one: First, can we remedy the\r\ndefects of the capitalistic system? And, if so, by what method shall\r\nwe proceed? Second, if the defects of capitalism cannot be remedied,\r\nwhat industrial system shall be substituted for capitalism? It is not\r\na question of whether or not capitalism is faulty, but of whether it\r\nis more faulty than the system that would be substituted for it. The\r\nvirtues of capitalism, most authorities believe, clearly outweigh its\r\ndefects, and though some other system may eventually prove to have as\r\ngreat virtues with fewer defects, the burden of proof is upon those\r\nwho advocate other systems than capitalism. Until the advantage is\r\nclearly shown to be on the side of a rival system, it will be wise to\r\nretain capitalism.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS ON THE TEXT\r\n\r\n1.

DEFINITIONS.--The words \"single tax\" refer to a policy under\r\nwhich all public revenue is to be raised by a single tax on land\r\nvalue. All other taxes are to be abolished. By land value is meant the\r\nvalue of the land itself, irrespective of all improvements, such as\r\nditches, drains, and buildings. Everything done on the land to\r\nincrease its value would be counted as an improvement, and would thus\r\nbe exempt from taxation. This would leave only location value and\r\nfertility to be taxed. By location value is meant that value which is\r\ndue to the situation of the land. For example, land in a wilderness\r\nhas little or no location value, but if, later, schools, stores,\r\nrailroads, and other elements of community life develop in that\r\nregion, the land may take on great value because of its location in\r\nthe community. The fertility value of land is that value which is due\r\nto natural endowment in the way of moisture, climate, and soil\r\nelements.\r\n\r\n105. HENRY GEORGE AND HIS WORK.--The doctrine of single tax is closely\r\nassociated with the name of Henry George, an American reformer who\r\ndied in 1897. His theory was best developed in his book, _Progress and\r\nPoverty_, published in 1879. In this book George points out that in\r\nspite of the progress of the world, poverty persists. This is due\r\nchiefly, he contends, to the fact that land-owners take advantage of\r\nthe scarcity of good land to exact unduly high prices for its use.\r\nAccording to George, this monopoly of the gifts of Nature allows\r\nlandowners to profit from the increase in the community's\r\nproductiveness, but keeps down the wages of the landless laborers.\r\n\"Thus all the advantages gained by the march of progress\", George\r\nwrites, \"go to the land-owner, and wages do not increase.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge proposed to use the single tax as an engine of social reform,\r\nthat is to say, to apply it with the primary view of leveling the\r\ninequalities of wealth. Value due to improvements was to be exempt\r\nfrom taxation, so that land-owners might not be discouraged from\r\nmaking improvements on their land. On the other hand, it was proposed\r\nthat the single tax take all of the income due to location and\r\nfertility. This, according to George, would \"render it impossible for\r\nany man to exact from others a price for the privilege of using those\r\nbounties of Nature to which all men have an equal right.\"\r\n\r\n106. RESULTS CLAIMED FOR THE SINGLE TAX.--George claimed that the\r\napplication of the single tax was highly desirable. If, through the\r\nmedium of this tax, the government were to take from the land-owners\r\nall the location and fertility value of their land, two great benefits\r\nwere to result. First, rich landlords would be deprived of much\r\nunearned wealth. Second, the wealth so secured, called the unearned\r\nincrement, could be used to make life easier for the poor. Ultimately,\r\nGeorge went so far as to claim, the single tax would \"raise wages,\r\nincrease the earnings of capital, extirpate pauperism, abolish\r\npoverty, give remunerative employment to whoever wishes it, afford\r\nfree scope to human powers, lessen crimes, elevate morals and taste\r\nand intelligence, purify government, and carry civilization to yet\r\nnobler heights.\" The steps by which George arrived at this gratifying\r\nconclusion are obscure, and practically every modern economist agrees\r\nthat too much has been claimed for the theory. Nevertheless, there is\r\nmuch to be said on both sides of this interesting question.\r\n\r\n107. ARGUMENTS FOR THE SINGLE TAX.--Single taxers claim that it is\r\njust to take from land-owners that land value which is not due to\r\ntheir individual efforts. Fertility, on the one hand, is due\r\noriginally to the bounty of Nature, and as such belongs to all men\r\nalike, rather than to particular individuals. Location value, on the\r\nother hand, is due to community growth, and should therefore be taken\r\nfor the benefit of the community at large.\r\n\r\nA very strong argument in favor of the single tax is that land cannot\r\nbe hidden from the tax assessor, as can stocks, bonds, jewels, and\r\nother forms of personal property. A single tax on land would,\r\ntherefore, be relatively easy to apply.\r\n\r\nA tax on the location and fertility value of land would not discourage\r\nindustry. Location value is largely or entirely due to community\r\ngrowth, rather than to the efforts of the individual land-owner.\r\nFertility, of course, is largely a natural endowment, and as such\r\ncannot be destroyed by a tax. The land would continue to have all of\r\nits location value, and probably much of its fertility value, whether\r\nor not the owner were taxed.\r\n\r\nAnother argument is that a single tax on land would eliminate taxes on\r\nlive stock, buildings, and all other forms of property except land,\r\nand that this would encourage the development of the forms of property\r\nso exempted. This would stimulate business.\r\n\r\nIt has also been said that the single tax would force into productive\r\nuse land which is now being held for speculative purposes. It is\r\nclaimed that many city tracts remain idle because the owners are\r\nholding them in the hope of getting a higher price in the future.\r\nAccording to the single taxer, a heavy tax would offset this hope of\r\ngain, and would force speculators either to put the land to a\r\nproductive use, or to sell it to someone who would so employ it.\r\n\r\nA last important argument in favor of the single tax is that it might\r\nforce into productive work certain capable individuals who are now\r\nsupported in idleness by land rents. Professor Carver has pointed out\r\nthat if the single tax deprived such persons of their incomes, they\r\nwould be forced to go to work, and thus the community would gain by an\r\nincrease in the number of its productive workers.\r\n\r\n108. ARGUMENTS AGAINST THE SINGLE TAX.--The most important objection\r\nto the single tax is that the confiscation of land, or, what amounts\r\nto the same thing, the confiscation of the income which land yields,\r\nis unjust. \"Pieces of land,\" Professor Seager points out, \"have\r\nchanged hands on the average dozens of times in the United States, and\r\npresent owners have in most cases acquired them not as free gifts of\r\nNature, nor as grants from the government, but by paying for them,\r\njust as they have had to pay for other species of property.\" Where\r\nindividuals have acquired land in good faith, and under the protection\r\nof a government which guarantees the institution of private property,\r\nthe confiscation of land value would be demoralizing to the community\r\nand unfair to its land-owning citizens.\r\n\r\nAnother difficulty lies in the ease with which value due to permanent\r\nimprovements is confused with value due to location or fertility.\r\nWhere money has been expended in draining land, removing stones or\r\napplying fertilizer, it is hard to tell, after a few years, what part\r\nof the value of the land is due to improvements. The possibility of\r\nthis confusion would cause some land-owners to neglect to improve\r\ntheir land, or might even cause them to neglect to take steps to\r\nretain the original fertility. Thus the single tax might result in the\r\ndeterioration of land values.\r\n\r\nIt is also objected that the single tax would provide an inelastic\r\ntaxation system. This means that it would tend to bring in an equal\r\namount of revenue each year, whereas the revenue needs of government\r\nvary from year to year. A good tax system will accommodate itself to\r\nthe varying needs of the government, always meeting the expenses of\r\ngovernment, but at the same time taking as little as possible from the\r\npeople. [Footnote: Some opponents of the single tax declare that the\r\nheaviest possible tax on land would yield only a fraction of the\r\nrevenue needed to finance the government. Single taxers, however,\r\nmaintain that the tax would yield more than enough revenue to meet\r\npublic expenditures. The merits of this argument are uncertain.]\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful whether the single tax would force into productive use\r\nland now being held by speculators. Even though a heavy tax were laid\r\nupon such land, it would not be utilized unless there were an\r\nimmediate use to which it could profitably be put.\r\n\r\nA last important argument against the single tax is that there is no\r\ngood reason for removing the tax burden from all except land-owners.\r\nLand is only one form of wealth, and it is unfair not to tax\r\nindividuals who hold property in some other form. Some land value is\r\nindeed unearned, but there are other forms of unearned wealth, as, for\r\nexample, monopoly gains and inherited property. Taxes ought to be\r\nlevied upon these forms of unearned wealth, as well as upon the\r\nunearned income from land. It is desirable, too, to levy at least a\r\nlight tax upon the propertyless classes, in order to encourage them to\r\nfeel an interest in, and a sense of responsibility for, the conduct of\r\ntheir government.\r\n\r\n109. SERVICE RENDERED BY THE SINGLE TAX AGITATION.--Economists are\r\nunanimous in agreeing that the single tax, as expounded by Henry\r\nGeorge, is too drastic and special a reform to find wide favor.\r\nNevertheless, the single taxers have performed a valuable service by\r\nemphasizing the fact that in many cases the income from land is\r\nlargely or entirely unearned. It would be manifestly unjust to\r\ndispossess present-day land-owners who have acquired land in good\r\nfaith; on the other hand, most economists agree that we ought to\r\nreform our tax system so as to take for the community a larger share\r\nof the future unearned increment of land values. As Professor Taussig\r\nhas pointed out, no one has a vested right in the indefinite future.\r\nThe taking of this future unearned increment, it is hardly necessary\r\nto add, would not constitute a single tax, but rather a heavy land\r\ntax. Many other taxes would continue to be levied. [Footnote: The\r\ngeneral problem of taxation is discussed in Chapter XXXIL]\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS ON THE TEXT\r\n\r\n1. Define the single tax.\r\n\r\n2.

THE NATURE OF PROFIT SHARING.--The essence of profit sharing is\r\nthat the workmen in a given enterprise receive, in addition to their\r\nregular wages, a share in the profits which would ordinarily go\r\nentirely to the entrepreneur. The share going to the employees varies\r\nwith the establishment, but generally from one quarter to three\r\nquarters of the profits are divided among them.\r\n\r\nDistribution is by various methods. The workmen may receive their\r\nshare in cash at the end of the year. Sometimes the money is placed in\r\na provident fund for the workmen as a body; in other cases it is\r\ndeposited in savings banks to the account of the individual workmen.\r\nIn still other cases the workman's share is invested in the business\r\nfor him, the workman thereafter receiving dividends on this invested\r\ncapital.\r\n\r\nIn every case, however, the division of profits among the individual\r\nlaborers is on the basis of the wages received, that is to say, the\r\nhigher the regular wage received by a workman, the larger will be his\r\nshare of the profits set aside for distribution. Generally, too, only\r\nworkmen who are steadily employed are allowed to share in the\r\ndistribution of profits.\r\n\r\n111. LIMITS OF PROFIT SHARING.--Profit sharing was once considered a\r\nremedy for many of our industrial troubles, but it is now generally\r\nconceded that the plan is decidedly limited in scope. Profit sharing\r\nincreases the income of the workmen involved, but for this very reason\r\nit is often bitterly opposed by the trade unions. The unions fear, of\r\ncourse, that the plan will make the workmen interested chiefly in the\r\nemployees of their particular establishment, rather than in the\r\nworkmen in the trade as a whole. The trade unions also maintain that\r\nprofit sharing is often administered in a patronizing manner, which is\r\noffensive to the self-respect of the workmen.\r\n\r\nTo a large extent, the spread of profit sharing depends upon the\r\ndevelopment of altruism among employers. But unfortunately altruistic\r\nemployers are rare, and the majority of entrepreneurs will not adopt\r\nthe profit-sharing plan unless it promises to result in some distinct\r\nadvantage to themselves. This attitude explains, in part, the failure\r\nof many profit-sharing experiments. Employers have sometimes tried out\r\nprofit sharing in the hope that it would prevent strikes and other\r\nlabor troubles. In some cases this expectation has been realized; in\r\nmany other cases serious labor troubles have continued. This\r\ncontinuance of labor troubles has rendered profit sharing less\r\nattractive to certain types of employers.\r\n\r\nIn certain cases employers have experimented with profit sharing in\r\nthe hope that it would stimulate efficiency and economy on the part of\r\nthe workmen. Sometimes the immediate effect of the adoption of the\r\nplan has been to make the workmen more efficient and more interested\r\nin their tasks, but after the novelty of the scheme has worn off they\r\nhave generally fallen back into their former pace. In justice to the\r\nworkmen, it should be noted here that in most enterprises the\r\nconditions of the market and the employer's managerial ability have\r\nmore influence upon profits than have the personal efforts of\r\nindividual workmen. Where workmen realize this, they tend to lose\r\nfaith in their ability to influence the share accruing to them under\r\nthe profit-sharing plan.\r\n\r\nA last important reason why profit sharing is limited in scope is that\r\nin many hazardous enterprises, such as mining, agriculture, fishing,\r\nor building construction, the refusal and inability of the workmen to\r\nshare in possible losses prevent the adoption of the plan. A mining\r\ncorporation, for example, may make large profits one year, and lose\r\nheavily the second year. Profit sharing is here inadvisable, if not\r\nimpossible. The distribution among the workmen of a large share of the\r\nprofits accruing at the end of the first year might so deplete the\r\nfinancial reserves of the entrepreneur that he would be unable to meet\r\nthe losses of the second year.\r\n\r\nB. COÍPERATION\r\n\r\n112. RELATION OF PROFIT SHARING TO COÍPERATION.--Profit sharing\r\npermits the workmen to secure more than a regular wage from a given\r\nenterprise, without, however, giving them any control over the\r\nmanagement of the business. Co÷peration goes a step farther, and\r\nattempts to dispense with either a number of middlemen or with the\r\nmanaging employer, or with both middlemen and employer. In the case of\r\na profit-sharing scheme in which the share of the profits accruing to\r\nthe workmen is invested in the business for them, ultimate control of\r\nthe enterprise may come into the hands of the workmen through profit\r\nsharing. In such a case the plant might be conducted co÷peratively. In\r\npractically every instance, however, co÷peration does not grow out of\r\nprofit sharing, but arises independently.\r\n\r\n113. ESSENCE OF COÍPERATION.--The essence of co÷peration is that a\r\ngroup of individuals undertake to perform for themselves those\r\nfunctions which are commonly carried on by the business man.\r\nCo÷peratives are often workmen, though not necessarily so.\r\n\r\nUnder the co÷perative plan, all of the profits of the enterprise are\r\ndivided among the co÷perators; on the other hand, the risks of the\r\nbusiness must also be borne by them. Management of the enterprise is\r\nconducted partly by officers or committees serving without pay, and\r\npartly by paid agents. The general policies of the business are\r\nsettled by the co÷perators acting as a body.\r\n\r\nCo÷peration seeks to exchange the centralized control of the business\r\nman for the diffuse control of a group of co÷perators. This\r\narrangement, its advocates hope, will permit wealth and power to be\r\ndistributed among more and more people, and especially among those\r\nclasses that possess relatively little property. Let us inquire\r\nbriefly into the four types of co÷peration.\r\n\r\n114. CONSUMERS' COÍPERATION.--Consumers' co÷peration, also known as\r\ndistributive co÷peration or co÷peration in retail trade, is the most\r\ncommon form of co÷peration. It is also probably the most successful\r\nform.\r\n\r\nIn this form of co÷peration, a number of individuals contribute their\r\nsavings to a common fund, buy certain desired commodities at wholesale\r\nprices, and distribute these among themselves. Generally, the\r\nco÷perative store sells to its members at the regular retail price,\r\nbut at stated intervals throughout the year the profits of the\r\nbusiness are distributed among the co÷peratives in proportion to the\r\namount of their individual purchases. Thus the difference between the\r\nwholesale and the retail price--minus the expense of conducting the\r\nstore--goes to the co÷perators, instead of to a store keeper or other\r\nmiddleman.\r\n\r\nOne of the best examples of consumers' co÷peration is the Rochdale\r\nSociety of Equitable Pioneers, established in England in 1844. This\r\ntype of co÷peration has also been remarkably successful in Germany,\r\nBelgium, and other continental countries. The idea was taken up in the\r\nUnited States about the middle of the nineteenth century, and at the\r\npresent time there are in this country about 2000 co÷perative stores,\r\nmany of them doing a thriving business. These stores are located\r\nchiefly in New England, the North Central States, and the West, few\r\nbeing found in the South.\r\n\r\n115. COÍPERATION IN CREDIT.--Credit co÷peration may take any one of a\r\nnumber of forms. In one of the best known forms, a group of persons\r\nform a credit society by contributing a proportion of their personal\r\nsavings to a common fund. On the strength of this capital, and of\r\ntheir own individual liability, they borrow more capital. The total\r\namounts thus got together are then loaned to the members of the\r\nsociety at a specified rate of interest. This rate of interest is\r\nhigher than that at which the group had borrowed money from outside\r\nsources; nevertheless, it is lower than the rate members would have to\r\npay if they individually sought loans at a bank. This is the aim of\r\nco÷peration in credit: to enable persons of small means to secure\r\nloans without paying the high rates which as individuals they would\r\nordinarily have to meet, if, indeed, they as individuals could secure\r\nloans under any conditions.\r\n\r\nCredit co÷peration has been most successful in Germany, particularly\r\namong artisans and small farmers. It has also attained considerable\r\nsuccess among the small tradesmen and artisans of Italy. In the United\r\nStates co÷peration in credit is less highly developed, but recently\r\nits influence has been slowly increasing. In many cases it supplies\r\nthe principle underlying building and loan associations in this\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n116. COÍPERATION IN MARKETING.--The co÷perative principle has also\r\nbeen applied to the marketing of agricultural products. In Denmark,\r\nfor example, it has been found that farmers can market their dairy\r\nproducts co÷peratively, and thus save for themselves much of the\r\nprofit that would otherwise go to commission agents and other\r\nmiddlemen. A similar saving has been effected in Holland, Belgium,\r\nand, to some extent, in France. Of recent years, co÷peration in\r\nmarketing has become important in the United States, finding\r\nparticular favor among the farmers of the Middle and Far West. At the\r\npresent time there are in this country more than two thousand\r\nco÷perative cheese factories, and more than three thousand co÷perative\r\ncreameries. There are also more than a thousand societies for the\r\nco÷perative marketing of fruit, as well as numerous live-stock selling\r\nagencies.\r\n\r\n117. COÍPERATION IN PRODUCTION.--The three forms of co÷peration which\r\nwe have been considering seek to eliminate unnecessary middlemen from\r\nindustry. In producers' co÷peration, on the other hand, the attempt is\r\nmade to get rid of the entrepreneur, or managing employer. A group of\r\nworkmen get together, subscribe or borrow the required capital,\r\npurchase tools, materials, and plant, and set up as producers. They\r\nseek markets for their product, direct the enterprise either as a\r\ngroup or through salaried agents, share the profits among themselves,\r\nand accept the risks of the enterprise.\r\n\r\nCo÷peration in production has been tried repeatedly in the various\r\ncountries of Europe, but without success. True producers' co÷perative\r\nassociations have also met with almost universal failure in the United\r\nStates, though experiments have been made in a variety of industries,\r\nand in nearly every part of the country. Formerly the Minneapolis\r\nCo÷pers were a co÷perative group which seemed destined to attain a\r\nconsiderable success in production, but this group has now abandoned\r\nthe co÷perative principle. The co÷perative marketing of fruit, cheese,\r\nand other agricultural products is, of course, not true producers'\r\nco÷peration, but rather the co÷perative marketing of commodities\r\nproduced by individual enterprisers.\r\n\r\n118. BACKWARDNESS OF COÍPERATION IN THE UNITED STATES.--In all forms\r\nof co÷peration, progress has been much slower in this country than in\r\nEurope. There are several reasons for this. For one thing, American\r\nworkmen move about to a greater extent than do European workmen,\r\nwhereas co÷peration succeeds best where the co÷perators have a fixed\r\nresidence and develop a strong sense of group solidarity. The fact\r\nthat our population is made up of diverse racial types likewise checks\r\nthe growth of the feeling of solidarity.\r\n\r\nAn important reason for the backwardness of the co÷perative movement\r\nin this country is that American workmen \"make, rather than save\r\nmoney,\" whereas co÷peration requires thrift, and a willingness to\r\npractice small economies. Again, the efficiency and progressiveness of\r\nour industrial system renders co÷perative ventures less necessary in\r\nthis country than in some parts of Europe. It is particularly true\r\nthat retail stores in the United States are more efficient than\r\nsimilar shops in England and on the Continent.\r\n\r\nAltogether, the most successful co÷perators in this country are not\r\nnative-born Americans, but groups of Finns, Russians, Slovaks, and\r\nother peoples of immediately foreign derivation. It is among these\r\ngroups that the thrift and group solidarity demanded by co÷peration\r\nare best found.\r\n\r\n119. LIMITS OF COÍPERATION.--Consumers' co÷peration, co÷peration in\r\ncredit, and co÷peration in marketing all seek to improve the\r\ncapitalistic system by eliminating some of the unnecessary middlemen\r\nfrom our industrial life. In so far as this is true, these forms of\r\nco÷peration are desirable developments, and deserve to succeed. Though\r\nthe movement is limited by the considerations set forth in the\r\npreceding section, it is to be hoped that these three forms of\r\nco÷peration will in the future show a considerable development in this\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nProducers' co÷peration is a different affair. Rather than attempting\r\nto decrease the number of unnecessary middlemen, it attempts to\r\nsupersede the entrepreneur or managing employer where he is most\r\nneeded. For this reason producers' co÷peration will probably continue\r\na failure. To run a modern business of any size at all requires a\r\ndegree of intelligence, imagination, judgment, courage, and\r\nadministrative ability which is altogether too rare to be found among\r\ncasual groups of laborers. Varied experience, high ability, the\r\ndetermination to accept the risks of the enterprise, and a consistent\r\nsingleness of purpose are necessary in modern production. Even though\r\nco÷perators are able to secure an amount of capital sufficient to\r\ninitiate production, they rarely have the requisite ability or\r\nexperience; too often they object to accepting the risks of the\r\nenterprise; practically never can they administer the business with\r\nthat unity of control which characterizes the most successful business\r\nenterprises.\r\n\r\n120. BENEFITS OF COÍPERATION.--While no longer considered a far-\r\nreaching industrial reform, the co÷perative movement brings with it\r\nmany benefits. Co÷peration in retail trade, credit, and marketing cuts\r\ndown the waste between consumer and producer, and thus helps\r\nsubstantially to reduce the cost of living. Co÷peration in production,\r\nthough it fails to reach its chief objective, has the virtue of\r\ndemonstrating to groups of workmen that the entrepreneur is of far\r\nmore value in our industrial life than they might otherwise have\r\nrealized. Aside from these advantages, co÷peration in any form is an\r\nimportant educative force. It fosters the spirit of solidarity and\r\nmutual helpfulness among members of a group or community. It teaches\r\nthrift. It trains the co÷perating individuals to exercise foresight\r\nand self-control. Altogether the training which it affords is\r\nproductive of good citizenship.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS ON THE TEXT\r\n\r\n1. Explain clearly the nature of profit sharing.\r\n\r\n2.

SOCIALISM IS A VAGUE TERM.--It is often said that the term\r\n\"socialism\" is so vague that it is useless to attempt to define it.\r\nThe word is used to cover all sorts of schemes of industrial and\r\nsocial reform. Sometimes a person whose viewpoint concerning politics\r\nor business has become more liberal appears to himself or to others as\r\na socialist. From the standpoint of many individuals, all those who\r\nadvocate the extension of government control are socialists. Still\r\nothers label as socialists all reformers with whose ideas they are not\r\nin accord. It very often happens that persons who pass in the\r\ncommunity for socialists are not recognized as such by the official\r\nsocialist parties. Indeed, certain official socialist groups go so far\r\nas to declare that other official socialist groups are \"not really\r\nsocialists,\" either in thought or in action.\r\n\r\n122. A DEFINITION OF SOCIALISM.--In spite of this confusion it is\r\npossible to formulate a rather precise definition of socialism.\r\nLeaving until later the distinction between the chief socialist\r\ngroups, we may say that the following definition covers all who are\r\nstrictly socialists: Socialism is an economic theory which aims to\r\nabolish the capitalistic system, and to substitute for it \"a system of\r\ncollective ownership and democratic management of the socially\r\nnecessary means of production and distribution.\" In rather more simple\r\nlanguage, socialism intends that all income-producing property shall\r\nbe owned and directed by the state. The state is to own and operate\r\nland, factories, workshops, railroads, and all other means of\r\nproduction. Private property and the competitive system are to be\r\nabolished. [Footnote: Socialism does not seek to abolish the private\r\nownership of food, clothing, and other forms of consumers' goods, yet\r\nboth socialists and non-socialists accept the unqualified statement\r\nthat \"socialism seeks to abolish private property.\" because it is the\r\nprivate ownership of producers' goods rather than of consumers' goods,\r\nwhich constitutes a cornerstone of the capitalistic system.] All\r\nbusiness is to be conducted by the government, and all persons are to\r\nbe employees of the government. The distribution of wealth is to be\r\ndirected by the government.\r\n\r\n123. RELATION OF SOCIALISM TO OTHER RADICAL THEORIES.--The terms\r\n\"communism\" and \"socialism\" call for careful distinction. What is now\r\nknown as socialism was formerly known as communism. For example, Karl\r\nMarx, the founder of modern socialism, called himself a communist. His\r\nfollowers later abandoned the name, and began calling themselves\r\nsocialists. Still later, during the World War, a group of Russian\r\nsocialists, popularly known as the bolshevists, revived the term\r\ncommunist in the sense used by Marx. Strictly speaking, however,\r\ncommunism is generally thought of to-day as a type of small community\r\norganization in which all wealth, including both the instruments of\r\nproduction and consumers' goods, is owned by the community. Socialism,\r\non the other hand, proposes that the state own and operate only the\r\ninstruments of production, leaving food, clothing, and other\r\nconsumers' goods to be owned and enjoyed by individuals.\r\n\r\nSocialism is often thought of in connection with the doctrine of\r\nanarchy. Anarchism and socialism are alike in that both object to one\r\nman having authority over another. Anarchism agrees with socialism\r\nthat capitalism is bad because it gives the employer power over the\r\nlaborer. But at this point the two theories begin sharply to diverge.\r\nSocialism desires to abolish private property and to concentrate all\r\nauthority in the hands of the state. The anarchist maintains that this\r\nis simply a transference of authority, and declares that authority in\r\nany form is an evil. Thus where socialism seeks to enlarge the powers\r\nof the state, anarchism objects to the existence of any governmental\r\nauthority whatsoever.\r\n\r\nIn addition to communism and anarchism, there are a number of\r\ninteresting theories that are more or less closely associated with the\r\nsocialist movement. These will not be discussed here, for two reasons:\r\nfirst, an adequate treatment of them would permit the problem of\r\nindustrial reform to take up a disproportionate share of our time;\r\nsecond, many of these theories, while interesting, are relatively\r\nunimportant, from the standpoint of American democracy at least. We\r\nmay, therefore, confine ourselves to socialism proper, as defined in\r\nSection 122.\r\n\r\n124. KARL MARX AND HIS INFLUENCE.--The germ of socialism can be traced\r\nback as far as Plato, but the modern movement takes its main impetus\r\nfrom the teachings of Karl Marx. Karl Marx was a German Jew, who lived\r\nbetween 1818 and 1883. Marx early became known for his radical views\r\non political and economic subjects. In 1848, he published, in\r\ncollaboration with Frederick Engels, the well-known Communist\r\nManifesto. The Manifesto, which has been called the \"birth-cry of\r\nmodern socialism,\" gives in concise form the essence of the socialist\r\ndoctrine. In 1864 Marx helped organize the \"International,\" a\r\nfederation of radical thinkers, with affiliations in the different\r\ncountries of Europe. In 1867 he published the first volume of his\r\nfamous work, _Capital_, which elaborated the views set forth in the\r\nManifesto, and which has since been adopted as the \"Bible of\r\nSocialism.\" Due to the great influence which Marx has exerted upon\r\nsocialist doctrine, he may justly be called the founder and\r\ninspiration of modern socialism.\r\n\r\n125. THE SOCIALIST INDICTMENT.--The claims of socialism, as formulated\r\nby Marx and elaborated by his followers, constitute a serious\r\nindictment of present-day society. Socialists point out, for example,\r\nthat the capitalistic system has numerous faults. They call attention\r\nto the fact that capitalism involves enormous wastes in materials and\r\nmen; they show that luxurious and injurious goods are produced; and\r\nthey maintain that in the past natural resources have often been\r\nmonopolized by a few. They believe the system of private property to\r\nbe unjust, and declare that free competition involves needless\r\nduplication of effort. At the present time, it is contended, all the\r\ngood things of life go to a few, while the masses remain in poverty\r\nand misery. Socialists declare that the fruits of capitalism are\r\nunemployment, industrial accidents, crime, vice, poverty, disease, and\r\npremature death. These charges are serious, and Chapter XVI will be\r\ndevoted to their critical examination. In this chapter we are\r\nconcerned chiefly with an exposition of the socialist doctrine.\r\n\r\n126. ECONOMIC INTERPRETATION OF HISTORY.--Formerly a great principle\r\nof socialism was the claim that all history has been determined by\r\neconomic forces. According to this view, our whole social and\r\npolitical life, including our basic ideas concerning religion, art,\r\nscience, and government, are only the reflected result of economic\r\nforces. History, Marx contended, is the record of how one class has\r\ngained wealth and power at the expense of another class. The present\r\nstate of society, he asserted, is the result of the exploitation of\r\nthe masses by a few.\r\n\r\nWith this principle we need not further concern ourselves. It is an\r\nacademic appendage to the socialist doctrine, and at the present time\r\nis not stressed by socialists. The majority of socialists now concede\r\nthat while economic forces have been important in history, social,\r\nreligious, and political forces are also important. In view of this\r\nadmission, the chief importance of the doctrine of the economic\r\ninterpretation of history is its theoretical connection with the two\r\ngreat cornerstones of socialism: the theory of surplus value, and the\r\ntheory of class struggle.\r\n\r\n127. THEORY OF SURPLUS VALUE.--Marx claimed that practically all\r\nwealth has been created by the laborers alone, and that all persons\r\nother than laborers are parasites. To those who have carefully studied\r\nChapter VIII the error of this claim must appear self-evident,\r\nnevertheless, this concept of value is the basis of all socialist\r\nattacks upon government and industry. Marx developed this theory as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nThe value of an article is determined solely by the amount of labor\r\nexpended upon its production. But although the laborer creates all\r\nwealth, the capitalist is enabled, by virtue of his monopolistic\r\ncontrol over the instruments of production, to prevent this wealth\r\nfrom going entirely to the laborer. [Footnote: By \"capitalists\"\r\nsocialism means not only individuals with money to loan, but\r\n\"employers\" in general, whether middlemen, entrepreneurs, or true\r\ncapitalists. ] Socialism declares that the capitalist holds the\r\nlaborer in virtual slavery, the laborer receiving only enough of the\r\nwealth created by him to enable him to keep alive, while the surplus\r\nof this wealth goes to the capitalist. The capitalist is thus a\r\nparasite who performs no useful task, but robs the laborers of the\r\nfruits of their industry. Marx did not regard profits as reward for\r\nbusiness enterprise, but called them \"plunder.\" Capitalism, according\r\nto this view, is a system of theft, involving \"misery, oppression,\r\nslavery, degradation, and exploitation.\"\r\n\r\n128. CLASS STRUGGLE.--Marx declared that the capitalistic system was\r\ndoomed to destruction. He maintained that as time went on, wealth\r\nwould tend to concentrate more and more in the hands of the capitalist\r\nor employing class. Trusts and monopolies would become more common,\r\nand gradually capitalism would become so unwieldy and so unworkable a\r\nmechanism that it would finally fall to pieces of its own weight.\r\nCrises, panics, and trade depressions were supposed to be indications\r\nof this inevitable disaster.\r\n\r\nThe tendency for wealth to concentrate in the hands of a few was to be\r\naccompanied by the growing poverty of the masses. Marx believed that\r\nthe middle classes would eventually disappear, leaving only the\r\nwealthy employers and the miserable laborers. The individuals\r\ncomprising these two classes would steadily draw apart into two great\r\narmies which were destined to battle to the death. Socialism denies\r\nthat employers and laborers have anything in common, and insists that\r\nbetween these two groups a struggle must go on until the employing\r\nclass is abolished.\r\n\r\n129. WHAT IS THE ULTIMATE AIM OF SOCIALISM?--Nothing could here be\r\nmore important than to know the ultimate aim of socialism,\r\nnevertheless, there is among socialists no agreement as to the\r\nframework of the system which they expect to substitute for\r\ncapitalism. All socialists desire collective ownership and direction\r\nof the instruments of production, but beyond this there is practically\r\nnothing in the way of a constructive socialist program. Generally, it\r\nis declared that when capitalism has been abolished, the working\r\nclasses will organize industry on the basis of communal ownership. In\r\nthe socialist commonwealth there is to be no class struggle, for the\r\nreason that there are to be no classes. There is to be a just\r\ndistribution of wealth, together with an abolition of poverty,\r\nunemployment, and all forms of social injustice. But as to how this is\r\nto be accomplished we have no proof. The so-called constructive\r\nprogram of socialism is not so much a definite agreement as to aims\r\nand methods, as it is a confused and disordered expression of the\r\nattitude of different socialist groups toward capitalism. Indeed, when\r\nsocialists are asked to advance a concrete and definitely constructive\r\nprogram, the reply is often made that the advent of socialism is so\r\nfar distant that the constructive side of its program is of no\r\nimmediate consequence.\r\n\r\n130. NEGATIVE CHARACTER OF SOCIALISM.--But although the constructive\r\nprogram of socialism is vague and unreal, its destructive or negative\r\nprogram is definite and very real. Socialism is opposed to government\r\nas it exists to-day, and to that extent, it disapproves of the\r\nConstitution of the United States. The capitalistic system is to be\r\ndestroyed. The institution of private property is to be abolished.\r\nFree competition and private initiative are to be abolished or greatly\r\nrestricted. All business is to be under the thumb of the government.\r\nPersonal liberty is to be narrowed down. Some socialists even go so\r\nfar as to declare war upon the family and the church, but though a\r\nnumber of socialist leaders favor the abolition of the institution of\r\nmarriage, and are professed atheists, it should be borne in mind that\r\nthe great majority of socialists are not openly hostile to the home\r\nand the church. Indeed, the average socialist is probably as friendly\r\nto these institutions as is the average non-socialist.\r\n\r\n131. SOCIALIST ATTITUTE TOWARD VIOLENCE.--It is important to\r\nunderstand the methods of socialism. Throughout the greater part of\r\nhis life, Karl Marx openly advocated violence and revolution as a\r\nmeans of securing the downfall of capitalism. Socialists, says the\r\nCommunist Manifesto, \"disdain to conceal their views and aims. They\r\nopenly declare that their ends can be attained only by the forcible\r\noverthrow of all existing social conditions.\" Toward the end of his\r\nlife, Marx changed this view somewhat, and apparently came to believe\r\nthat the overthrow of the capitalistic system might come gradually and\r\nwithout bloodshed. In accordance with this later view, there is to-day\r\na considerable socialist group which disavows violence. Members of\r\nthis group are known as political socialists.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, many socialists cling to Marx's earlier insistence\r\nupon violence and bloodshed as a means of attaining socialist ends.\r\nMembers of the latter class are known as militant socialists, as\r\nopposed to those who disavow violence and rely chiefly upon political\r\nweapons. The two best-known groups of militant socialists are the\r\nIndustrial Workers of the World and the Russian bolshevists.\r\n\r\n132. POLITICAL SOCIALISM.--Many political socialists are personally so\r\nmild and agreeable that the thought of unlawful action would never be\r\nassociated with them. The political socialist relies chiefly upon the\r\ngrowing political power of the working class to effect the abolition\r\nof capitalism. This emphasis upon political weapons has been\r\nparticularly noticeable among socialists living in democratic\r\ncountries where the franchise is widely extended, and where the will\r\nof the people is reflected through the action of their chosen\r\nrepresentatives. The political socialist makes a large use of\r\npropaganda. He tries to stir up the workingman, to create in him a\r\nfeeling of solidarity with his fellow workmen, and to incite a feeling\r\nof antipathy toward, and dislike for, the employing class. The\r\npolitical socialist emphasizes or exaggerates the undesirable side of\r\nthe laborer's life, and endeavors by promises of an industrial\r\nmillennium to rouse him to political action. \"Workingmen of the world,\r\nunite, you have nothing to lose but your chains,\" is the slogan of the\r\npolitical socialist.\r\n\r\n133. ALL SOCIALIST TEACHINGS TEND TOWARD VIOLENCE.--Though large\r\nnumbers of political socialists are peaceful and responsible citizens,\r\nit should be noted that all socialist teachings tend to result in\r\nviolence. The insistence of socialism upon the class struggle, the\r\ndeliberate encouragement of industrial ill-will and the general policy\r\nof obstructing the activities of government, all lead inevitably to\r\nviolence. Strikes involving bloodshed have in many instances been\r\ntraced to the teachings of political socialism. During the World War,\r\nmany political socialists in the United States supported our cause,\r\nbut others of this group opposed the selective draft, attempted to\r\ndemoralize our military forces, and impeded the conduct of the war by\r\ngiving aid and succor to German agents. By a series of slight steps,\r\npolitical socialism, theoretically law-abiding and harmless, may drift\r\ninto treasonable and revolutionary acts. The difference between\r\npolitical and militant socialism is thus one of degree only.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS ON THE TEXT\r\n\r\n1. Define socialism.\r\n\r\n2.

ORIGIN OF THE I.W.W.--The letters I.W.W. are a convenient\r\nabbreviation which is used to designate a group of militant socialists\r\ncalling themselves the Industrial Workers of the World. The I.W.W.\r\nresemble a French socialist group known as syndicalists, and on that\r\naccount the I.W.W. are sometimes called the American syndicalists. As\r\na matter of fact, the I.W.W. are a distinct group, and are in no way\r\naffiliated with the French syndicalists.\r\n\r\nThe I.W.W. movement can be traced to a miners' strike in Colorado in\r\n1903. As the result of the labor unrest which this strike accentuated,\r\na conference of radical labor leaders was called in Chicago in 1904,\r\nto discuss the question of forming a socialist organization which\r\nshould advocate methods more drastic than those of political\r\nsocialism. In the summer of 1905 a second convention was held in\r\nChicago, and a constitution was drawn up and subscribed to. Section 1\r\nof Article I of this constitution reads: \"This Organization shall be\r\nknown as the 'Industrial Workers of the World.'\"\r\n\r\n135. THE I.W.W. AND THE POLITICAL SOCIALISTS: SIMILARITIES.--Like the\r\npolitical socialists, the I. W. W. go back to Karl Marx for their\r\nbasic teachings. William D. Haywood, one of the I. W. W. leaders,\r\naccepted Marx's theory of surplus value in these terms: \"The theory of\r\nsurplus value is the beginning of all socialist knowledge. It shows\r\nthe capitalist in his true light, that of an idler and a parasite. It\r\nproves to the workers that capitalists should no longer be permitted\r\nto take any of their product.\" The I. W. W. also stress the class\r\nstruggle. The preamble to their constitution declares that \"the\r\nworking class and the employing class have nothing in common,\" and\r\nasserts that \"between these two classes a struggle must go on until\r\nall the workers of the world organize as a class, take possession of\r\nthe earth, and the machinery of production, and abolish the wage\r\nsystem.\" In these important particulars there is agreement between the\r\nI. W. W. and the political socialists.\r\n\r\n136. THE I.W.W. AND THE POLITICAL SOCIALISTS: DIFFERENCES.--The chief\r\ndifference between the two groups is one of method. The political\r\nsocialists prefer political action to violence; the I.W.W. prefer\r\nviolence to political action. The I.W.W. believe that political\r\nmethods are altogether too slow and unreliable, and accordingly they\r\nhave so far refused to affiliate with any political party. The extreme\r\nlimits to which the I.W.W. have gone in the matter of violence have\r\ncaused many political socialists to disavow this militant group. The\r\nattempt has even been made to prove that the I.W.W. are not socialists\r\nat all, though as a matter of fact they are as truly so as is any\r\nother socialist group.\r\n\r\n137. I.W.W. METHODS: THE STRIKE.--The I.W.W. use the strike, not as a\r\nmeans of securing better working conditions, but as a method of\r\nfomenting revolution. \"Instead of the conservative motto, 'A fair\r\nday's wages for a fair day's work,'\" declares the preamble to their\r\nconstitution, \"we must inscribe on our banner the revolutionary\r\nwatchword, 'Abolition of the wage system.'\" In their use of the\r\nstrike, the I.W.W. accordingly oppose conciliation or arbitration of\r\nany kind, and whether or not they gain their point, they go back to\r\nwork with the intention of striking again at the next opportune time.\r\nThis policy has been formulated by the I.W.W. in the following words:\r\n\"Strike; win as much as possible; go back to work; recuperate; strike\r\nagain... whatever concessions from capitalism the workers secure,\r\nsooner or later they will strike again.\"\r\n\r\nThe principal strikes initiated in pursuance of this policy occurred\r\nat McKees Rocks, Pennsylvania, in 1909; Lawrence, Massachusetts, in\r\n1912; Butte, Montana, in 1914; and Bisbee, Arizona, in 1916. Violence\r\nand lawlessness have been prominent features of each of these strikes.\r\n\r\n138. I.W.W. METHODS: SABOTAGE.--The word sabotage is of French origin,\r\nand is used to describe any sort of deliberate action on the part of\r\nworkmen which results in the destruction of the employer's property.\r\nSabotage is a species of guerrilla warfare, designed to foment the\r\nclass struggle. Louis Levine, an I. W. W. sympathizer, has said that\r\n\"stirring up strife and accentuating the struggle as much as is in his\r\npower is the duty\" of the I. W. W. Some of the commoner forms of\r\nsabotage are injuring delicate machinery, exposing the employer's\r\ntrade secrets to rival employers, lying to customers about the quality\r\nof the goods, crippling locomotives so that they cannot be operated,\r\nslashing the harness of teamsters, shipping perishable goods to the\r\nwrong destination, burning forests and wheat fields, sawing lumber\r\ninto unusual lengths, and allowing foodstuffs to spoil or deteriorate.\r\n\r\n139. I.W.W. METHODS: DESTRUCTION OF LIFE.--In their effort to destroy\r\nthe existing order of society, some of the I.W.W. are frankly willing\r\nto go as far as assassination. I.W.W. leaders have advised their\r\nfollowers, both orally and through their writings, to extend the term\r\nsabotage to cover the destruction of human life. During the World War\r\nthe I.W.W. caused a loss of life by putting poison in canned goods,\r\nand by causing train wrecks. They have advocated the placing of ground\r\nglass in food served in hotels and restaurants. Since the organization\r\nwas formed in 1905, several bomb outrages resulting in loss of life\r\nhave been charged against the I.W.W., but in justice to this group, it\r\nmust be observed that these crimes have never been proved to have been\r\ncommitted by authorized I. W. W. agents.\r\n\r\n140. NEGATIVE CHARACTER OF THE I.W.W.--The I.W.W. resemble the\r\npolitical socialists in their failure to offer a definite system which\r\ncould be substituted for the capitalistic system. Some of the I. W.\r\nW., it is true, have formulated a plan by means of which society is\r\nsome day to be organized primarily on an industrial basis. According\r\nto this program, the workers of a given industry, say the railroad\r\nindustry, will be organized into a single union, rather than, as at\r\npresent, into a number of trade unions, such as an engineers' union,\r\nas distinct from the firemen's union, the brakemen's union, etc. The\r\nrailroad union would in turn become a branch of a great transportation\r\nunion, and the transportation union would in turn become a division of\r\nthe \"One Big Union,\" which is to include all workers in all countries\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\nIf this plan were approved by the entire I. W. W. organization, it\r\nwould mean that the I. W. W. intended industry to be controlled by a\r\nsuper-organization of workingmen, all other persons to be excluded\r\nfrom any control whatsoever. As a matter of fact, this is the program\r\nof only a faction of the I. W. W. The idea of \"One Big Union\" is\r\nopposed by a second group, which insists that after the destruction of\r\ncapitalism, industry must be handed over to the exclusive control of\r\nsmall units of laborers, unaffiliated with, and uncontrolled by, any\r\nlarger organization. Beyond the formulation of these two opposing\r\nviews, a constructive I. W. W. program has never been developed.\r\nAttention continues to be centered upon the destruction of the present\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n141. UNDEMOCRATIC CHARACTER OF THE I. W. W.--The I. W. W. oppose our\r\npresent democracy. They oppose our Constitution and its fundamental\r\nguarantees of personal liberty, individual rights, and private\r\nproperty. They seek revolution, not in order to secure justice for the\r\nmasses, but in order to place the laboring class in complete power in\r\nindustry and government. They announce their intention of continuing\r\nthe class struggle \"until the working class is able to take possession\r\nand control of the machinery, premises, and materials of production\r\nright from the capitalists' hands, and to use that control to\r\ndistribute the product of industry _entirely_ among the workers.\"\r\n\r\n142. LIMITED APPEAL OF THE I. W. W. PROGRAM.--It is a testimonial to\r\nthe common sense of American workmen that the I. W. W. have made\r\nlittle headway. Until the Lawrence strike in 1912, the movement\r\ncentered in the Far West, and it is even now practically confined to\r\nthose parts of the West where industry is less well organized, and\r\nwhere family life is less stable. Miners, lumbermen, and railway\r\nconstruction workers are prominent in the movement. In general, the I.\r\nW. W. theory appeals chiefly to the lower strata of unskilled labor,\r\nto young and homeless workers, to transients, and to unassimilated\r\nimmigrants. The better trained and the more intelligent American\r\nworkmen reject the program of the I. W. W. These latter workmen\r\nbelieve in bettering their condition through the gradual development\r\nand enforcement of industrial standards, made possible by lawful\r\nco÷peration with the employer. The truth of this statement is borne\r\nout by the fact that whereas the I. W. W. number scarcely 30,000, the\r\nAmerican Federation of Labor has more than 4,000,000 members.\r\nNumerically the I. W. W. are unimportant, and it is chiefly their\r\nviolent and spectacular tactics which attract attention.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS ON THE TEXT\r\n\r\n1. What do the letters I. W. W. stand for?\r\n\r\n2.

SIGNIFICANCE OF BOLSHEVISM.-The term \"bolshevist\" is used to\r\ndesignate a group of militant socialists that seized power in Russia\r\nin the fall of 1917. Strictly speaking, the bolshevists were purely a\r\nRussian group, nevertheless, they are of interest to students of\r\nAmerican democracy. Until the outbreak of the World War socialism was\r\nprimarily a theory, the claims of which could not definitely be\r\nsettled for the reason that it had never been applied on a large\r\nscale. Bolshevism is significant because it is the only instance in\r\nthe history of the world where nation-wide socialism has actually been\r\nput into operation. The peculiar conditions surrounding the Russian\r\nexperiment may prevent any detailed conclusions as to the availability\r\nof bolshevist experience for other countries; on the other hand, the\r\ngeneral results of that experiment must throw some light upon what we\r\nmight expect if a socialist experiment were made in other countries.\r\nIt is important, therefore, that we inquire into the nature of the\r\nRussian socialist state.\r\n\r\n144. ORIGIN OF THE BOLSHEVISTS.--There is a popular impression that\r\nsince the word bolshevist means \"majority\" in the Russian language,\r\nthe bolshevists represented or constituted a majority of the Russian\r\npeople. This is not true, as the history of the group shows. The\r\norigin of the bolshevists dates from a convention of the Russian\r\nSocial-Democratic party in 1903, at which time a majority\r\n(_bolshinstvˇ_) took an extreme stand upon the policies then being\r\ndiscussed in convention. In the years that followed the bolshevists\r\nbecame known as the radical or extreme wing of the Russian Social-\r\nDemocratic party, as opposed to the menshevists, or moderate wing.\r\n\r\nIt appears that as early as 1905 the bolshevists planned to secure\r\ncontrol of the Russian government. The opportunity presented itself\r\nduring the World War, which Russia had entered early in August, 1914.\r\nIn March, 1917, a non-bolshevist group initiated a revolution, which\r\noverthrew the government of the Czar and established a provisional\r\ngovernment under the leadership of Alexander Kerensky. This government\r\nimmediately instituted a number of democratic reforms, including the\r\nextension of the suffrage to all men and women who were Russian\r\ncitizens. These citizens elected delegates to a constituent assembly,\r\nbut at this point the bolshevists, seeing that the voters of Russia\r\nwere overwhelmingly against bolshevism, attacked the new government.\r\nThe constituent assembly was forcibly dissolved, its defenders\r\nslaughtered, and on November 7, 1917, the bolshevists seized the reins\r\nof government. Thus bolshevism as a government came into being as the\r\nresult of suppressing the lawfully expressed will of the Russian\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n145. THE BOLSHEVIST CONSTITUTION: LIBERAL ELEMENTS.--On July 10, 1918,\r\nthe bolshevists adopted a constitution. This remarkable document was a\r\nstrange compound of liberal and despotic elements. It made a number of\r\nimportant promises to the people of Russia, announcing, for example,\r\nthat the new government would \"put an end to every ill that oppresses\r\nhumanity.\" In pursuit of this ideal, the church was separated from the\r\nstate, and complete freedom of conscience was accorded all citizens of\r\nRussia. Citizens were to enjoy complete freedom of speech and of the\r\npress. For the purpose of \"securing freedom of expression to the\r\ntoiling masses,\" provision was made for the free circulation\r\nthroughout the country of newspapers, books, and pamphlets. Full and\r\ngeneral education to the poorest peasantry was also promised. Capital\r\npunishment was declared abolished, and a solemn protest against war\r\nand violence of every kind was adopted.\r\n\r\n146. THE BOLSHEVIST CONSTITUTION: RESTRICTED SUFFRAGE.--These liberal\r\nprovisions were offset, however, by a number of important restrictions\r\nupon the voting rights of the people. Article IV of the bolshevist\r\nconstitution declared that the right to vote should not be extended to\r\nthe following groups: all persons employing hired laborers for profit,\r\nincluding farmers who have even a single part-time helper; all persons\r\nreceiving incomes from interest, rent, or profits; all persons engaged\r\nin private trade, even to the smallest shop-keeper; all ministers of\r\nreligion of any kind; all persons engaged in work which was not\r\nspecifically defined by the proper authorities as \"productive and\r\nuseful to society\"; members of the old royal family; and individuals\r\nformerly employed in the imperial police service. The constitution\r\nfurther provided that representation in the various deliberative\r\nassemblies (called soviets, or councils) should be arranged so that\r\none urban bolshevist would be equal, in voting strength, to five non-\r\nbolshevist peasants. Lastly, the constitution significantly neglected\r\nto provide any machinery whereby the voters, either as individuals or\r\nin groups, could make nominations for any governmental office. The\r\npower of nomination was assumed by various bolshevist officials.\r\n\r\n147. THE BOLSHEVIST CONSTITUTION: PROVISION FOR A DESPOTISM.--The\r\nbolshevist constitution frankly provided for a despotism. \"For the\r\npurpose of securing the working class in the possession of complete\r\npower,\" reads the concluding section of chapter two of the\r\nconstitution, \"and in order to eliminate all possibility of restoring\r\nthe power of the exploiters, (the capitalist or employing class), it\r\nis decreed that all workers be armed, and that a socialist Red Army be\r\norganized and the propertied class disarmed.\" These steps, the\r\nconstitution goes on to state, were to be taken for the express\r\npurpose of introducing nation-wide socialism into Russia.\r\n\r\n148. \"DICTATORSHIP OF THE PROLETARIAT.\"--Shortly after the publication\r\nof the constitution, Lenin and Trotzky, the two bolshevist leaders,\r\nestablished what was called the \"dictatorship of the proletariat.\" The\r\nword proletariat refers vaguely to the working classes, but the\r\nbolshevists interpreted the term to cover only that portion of the\r\nworkers which was pledged to the support of socialist doctrine. Lenin\r\nadmitted that a small number of bolshevized workingmen, the\r\nproletariat, was maintaining, by force of arms, a despotic control\r\nover the masses of the people. \"Just as 150,000 lordly landowners\r\nunder Czarism dominated the 130,000,000 of Russian peasants,\" he once\r\ndeclared, \"so 200,000 members of the bolshevist party are imposing\r\ntheir will on the masses.\" According to these figures, the controlling\r\nelement in Russia included less than one sixth of one per cent of the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nFrom the first, the great majority of the peasants stolidly resisted\r\nthe socialization of the country, but this did not discourage the\r\nbolshevist leaders. \"We have never spoken of liberty,\" said Lenin\r\nearly in 1921. \"We are exercising the dictatorship of the proletariat\r\nin the name of the minority because the peasant class in Russia is not\r\nyet with us. We shall continue to exercise it until they submit. I\r\nestimate the dictatorship will last about forty years.\"\r\n\r\n149. SUPPRESSION OF DEMOCRACY.--The democratic tendencies evidenced\r\nunder the Kerensky regime, and apparently encouraged by some of the\r\nprovisions of the bolshevist constitution, were quickly checked by the\r\ndictatorship. It became the policy of the government to deprive \"all\r\nindividuals and groups of rights which could be utilized by them to\r\nthe detriment of the socialist revolution.\" The semblance of a\r\nrepresentative system was retained, but voting power was so\r\ndistributed as to allow an oligarchic group to control the\r\ngovernment's policies. This group had the power to disallow elections\r\nwhich went against it, as well as the power to force the dismissal\r\nfrom local Soviets of anti-bolshevist members. The right to vote could\r\nbe arbitrarily withdrawn by order of the central authorities. Free\r\nspeech and the right to enjoy a free press were suppressed. Lenin\r\nadmitted that bolshevism \"does not represent the toiling masses,\" and\r\ndeclared that \"the word democracy cannot be scientifically applied to\r\nthe bolshevist party.\" Both Lenin and Trotzky declared that they had\r\nno fixed policy except to do whatever at the moment seemed expedient,\r\nregardless of previous statements or promises.\r\n\r\n150. ABOLITION OF THE CAPITALIST SYSTEM.--Socialism, so long a theory,\r\nbecame a practical concern at the moment that the bolshevists secured\r\ncontrol of the government. Private property in land was abolished, the\r\narable land of Russia being apportioned among agriculturists without\r\ncompensation to the former owners. All mines, forests, and waterways\r\nof national importance were taken over by the central government,\r\nwhile the smaller woods, rivers, and lakes became the property of the\r\nlocal Soviets. Banking establishments were seized and looted by\r\nbolshevist forces. Factories, railroads, and other means of production\r\nand transport were taken over. Inheritance was abolished. Private\r\ninitiative in business was forbidden. Members of the capitalist or\r\nemploying classes were imprisoned, murdered, or driven from the\r\ncountry. In a word, the capitalistic system was destroyed, and the\r\neconomic and political machinery of the country came under the full\r\ncontrol of a small socialist group, maintained in power by armed\r\nforce.\r\n\r\n151. PARALYSIS OF INDUSTRY UNDER SOCIALISM.--The substitution of\r\nsocialism for capitalism in Russia was followed by disaster. The\r\nworkers were unable to carry on the industries which had been handed\r\nover to them. Discouraged by repeated errors in administration, and\r\ndemoralized by their sudden rise to power, they neglected their work\r\nand pillaged the factories and shops in which they had formerly been\r\nemployed. The elimination of the managing employers resulted in a\r\ndecrease in output, and to aggravate the situation the laborers\r\ncontinued to insist upon a shorter and shorter working day. In\r\ndesperation the government attempted to keep the people at their tasks\r\nby force. The workers were exploited to a degree previously unknown,\r\neven in Russia. They worked longer hours and for less pay than\r\nformerly. In many places they were attached to their tasks like\r\nmedieval serfs, and even harnessed to carts like beasts of burden. The\r\ntrade unions were abolished, and the workers were forbidden to strike,\r\non pain of imprisonment or death. Yet despite these measures the\r\noutput of factories, mills, and mines steadily decreased. Industry\r\nstagnated, and business fell away. The millions of Russia were\r\nstarving in a land of plenty.\r\n\r\n152. RETURN TO CAPITALISTIC METHODS.--To save the country from\r\neconomic ruin, Lenin turned to capitalism. Free initiative and open\r\ncompetition in trade were again allowed. The socialization of\r\nrailroads, mills, and natural resources was halted. The arable land,\r\nwhich under socialism had not grown enough food to support even the\r\npeasants living upon it, was again cultivated under the wage system.\r\nThe capitalists and managing employers who were alive and still in\r\nRussia, were gathered together and placed in charge of industry. The\r\nlaborers, who had been promised an eight- or six-hour day and complete\r\ncontrol of industry, were now forced by the bolshevist government to\r\nwork long hours under their former employers for practically no pay.\r\nBy 1919 the essential features of the capitalistic system had been\r\naccepted by Lenin and Trotzky, the bolshevists continuing in power as\r\na despotic group which maintained authority over the laborers and the\r\nemployers by armed force. The theory that all except the laborers are\r\nparasites had been exploded.\r\n\r\n153. WAS SOCIALISM GIVEN A FAIR TRAIL IN RUSSIA?--To point out that an\r\nexperiment has failed is one thing; to prove that it has been\r\nattempted under fair conditions is quite another. We cannot,\r\ntherefore, condemn the bolshevist experiment without some regard for\r\nthe conditions under which it was conducted.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly, the bolshevists had to contend against several important\r\ndifficulties. The majority of the Russian people are illiterate\r\npeasants, who had had, at the time of the overthrow of the Czar in\r\n1917, little or no training in self-government. In 1917, Russia was,\r\nmoreover, in a state of political demoralization, the result of three\r\nyears of war, concluded by a military debacle and a disorderly peace.\r\nThe suddenness with which socialism was introduced was also a factor\r\nwhich handicapped the bolshevists.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, many favorable conditions were present. With\r\nrespect to natural resources, Russia is one of the richest countries\r\nin the world. She has practically everything necessary to a healthy\r\nand self-sufficing industrial life. Over this wealth the bolehevists\r\nhad full control. Lenin, the bolshevist chief, is conceded to have\r\nbeen a remarkable executive, so that the socialist experiment was\r\nconducted by a man not only well versed in Marxian doctrine, but\r\ncapable of exercising an intelligent and authoritative control of the\r\ngovernment. The bolshevist territory was blockaded by Great Britain,\r\nFrance, and the United States, but trade connections between Russia\r\nand the two last-named countries had been unimportant. Trade\r\nconnections with Germany and Sweden on the west, and China on the\r\neast, were not broken off.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that the socialist experiment in Russia was attended by\r\nimportant advantages and disadvantages. Whether or not bolshevism had\r\nan absolutely fair trial is as yet impossible to say. On the other\r\nhand, the disastrous failure of the experiment would seem to indicate\r\nthat it could not have met with any great degree of success under\r\nfairly favorable conditions. The admissions of the bolshevist leaders\r\nthemselves, together with the conclusions of the most impartial\r\ninvestigators of the experiment, justify the conclusion that socialism\r\nin Russia failed because it was based upon false principles. The\r\nbolshevists have been accused of having instituted a reign of terror,\r\nbringing in its train lawlessness, murder, desecration of the church,\r\nand the most brutal savagery. Into these charges we cannot go; it is\r\nenough that the most reliable evidence goes to show that bolshevism,\r\nas a nation-wide application of socialist doctrine, was a failure.\r\n\r\n154. FAILURE OF BOLSHEVIST PROPAGANDA BEYOND RUSSIA.--Bolshevism, in\r\ncommon with other varieties of socialism, sought to break down\r\nnational barriers and to establish a dictatorship of the proletariat\r\nin all of the countries of the world. Some of the milder socialists in\r\nwestern Europe and America disavowed the acts of the Russian group,\r\nbut the majority of socialists beyond Russia appear to have at least\r\nsecretly sympathized with the bolshevists. Encouraged by this\r\nattitude, Lenin and Trotzky frankly admitted their intention of\r\nfomenting world-wide revolution. The bolshevist government\r\nappropriated large sums for propaganda in countries beyond Russia, and\r\nsocialist sympathizers everywhere advocated an attempt to overthrow\r\n\"world capitalism.\" In the period of unrest immediately following the\r\nWorld War there was some response to bolshevist propaganda in a number\r\nof countries, but sounder opinion prevailed, and in 1920 Lenin\r\nadmitted that the workingmen of Europe and America had definitely\r\nrejected his program. The one case of nation-wide socialism had proved\r\ntoo great a failure not to impress the laboring classes in the more\r\nadvanced countries of the world as a visionary and unworkable scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS ON THE TEXT\r\n\r\n1.

ADMINISTRATIVE DIFFICULTIES CONFRONTING SOCIALISM.--Under\r\nsocialism the work of government would be greatly increased. Thousands\r\nof intricate administrative rules would have to be drawn up for the\r\ncontrol and direction of activities now attended to by individuals\r\nanimated by personal interest.\r\n\r\nNow, it is seriously to be questioned whether the most highly\r\ncentralized government could effectively administer the innumerable\r\nactivities of our complex industrial life. Upon what basis would land\r\nbe distributed? How would individuals be apportioned among the various\r\nemployments? Upon what basis would the wages of millions of workmen be\r\ndetermined? Could so mechanical an agency as government foresee future\r\nbusiness conditions expertly enough to direct the productive forces of\r\nthe nation effectively? If prices are no longer to be fixed by\r\ncompetition, how, and by means of what agency, are they to be\r\ndetermined?\r\n\r\nThese are only a few of the vital questions which would arise in\r\nconnection with the administration of a socialist state. Various\r\nsuggestions have been made with regard to some of these difficulties,\r\nbut there is among socialists no general agreement as to the answer of\r\nany one of these questions. They continue to constitute, in the eyes\r\nof practical men, a grave obstacle to socialism.\r\n\r\n156. DANGERS OF A SOCIALIST BUREAUCRACY.--Governmental power would\r\nhave to be very highly centralized if a socialist state were\r\neffectively to administer the nation's economic activities as a unit.\r\nBut this very concentration of power might easily result in the\r\ndevelopment of a bureaucracy. Waste and the possibility of corruption\r\nhave unfortunately characterized even those governments over which the\r\npeople exercise considerable control; it seems probable that the\r\ngreater centralization of authority demanded by socialism would\r\nincrease rather than decrease these dangers.\r\n\r\nIt is to be noted here that the socialists, who might be supposed to\r\nconsider as paramount the interests of society or of the public, are\r\nthe very people who are least inclined to do anything of the kind.\r\n[Footnote: This concept was suggested to me by Professor Thomas Nixon\r\nCarver of Harvard University.] Socialists look upon the state only as\r\nan agency for benefiting particular groups of individuals. The\r\nemphasis of political socialism upon class struggle, the frank\r\nadmissions of the I.W.W. that they seek to suppress all but the\r\nlaboring class, and the establishment by the bolshevists of a\r\ndictatorship of the proletariat, all these facts indicate that\r\nsocialists seek the welfare of particular groups rather than the\r\nwelfare of the general public.\r\n\r\nBut class legislation is repugnant to the principles of American\r\ndemocracy. We believe in government by the masses and for the masses;\r\nfurthermore, we are committed to the ideal of as much individual\r\nfreedom and as little governmental compulsion as is compatible with\r\nthe good of both individual and community. The concept of a socialist\r\nbureaucracy, administered in the interests of particular groups, runs\r\ncounter to our fundamental beliefs and ideals.\r\n\r\n157. SOCIALISM WOULD DESTROY PERSONAL INITIATIVE.--One of the\r\nstrongest arguments against socialism is that it would destroy\r\npersonal initiative. Socialism runs counter to human nature by under-\r\nvaluing the principle of self-interest. Economists are generally\r\nagreed that the abolition of the institution of private property would\r\ncause the ambition of the individual to slacken. In spite of its\r\ndefects, it is the competitive system, with its promise of reward to\r\nthe energetic and the capable, which is largely responsible for the\r\nmiraculous prosperity of modern times. Men ordinarily will not undergo\r\nsystematic training, perfect inventions, strive to introduce greater\r\nand greater economies into their business, or undertake the risk of\r\ninitiating new enterprises, unless they are assured that they will be\r\nable to enjoy the fruits of their labor.\r\n\r\nAnd not only would socialism discourage ambition by abolishing private\r\nenterprise, but it might encourage inefficiency and shiftlessness.\r\nEvery man would be guaranteed a job, every individual would be\r\nprotected against want. It is even likely that a socialist state would\r\nundertake to rear and provide for the offspring of its citizens. Human\r\nexperience indicates that this degree of paternalism would encourage\r\nlaziness and increase irresponsibility.\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes said that under socialism men would work as eagerly\r\nfor social esteem as they now work for financial gain. This would be a\r\nhighly desirable condition, but unfortunately there is nothing in\r\nhuman experience to justify the hope that such a state of affairs will\r\nspeedily be realized. The spread of altruism in the modern world is\r\nheartening, but no sensible person will shut his eyes to the fact\r\nthat, for the immediate future at least, self-interest promises to be\r\nmuch more widespread than altruism. The love of gain may not be the\r\nhighest motive in life, but it is better than none, and for a long\r\ntime to come it will probably be the one which appeals most strongly\r\nto the average man. Socialists and non-socialists alike deplore the\r\ndomination which self-interest exercises over human affairs. But\r\nwhereas the non-socialist wisely tries to adapt a program of\r\nindustrial reform to this hard fact, many socialists appear to believe\r\nthat because the principle of self-interest often works out badly,\r\nthey ought to act as though that principle did not exist.\r\n\r\n158. SOCIALIST THEORY OF DISTRIBUTION UNSOUND.--Both socialists and\r\nnon-socialists admit that poverty is an undesirable condition. But\r\nover the method of improving the condition of the poor the socialist\r\nand the non-socialist disagree. The defender of capitalism begins by\r\npointing out that, under competitive conditions, the unskilled laborer\r\nis poor primarily because his labor is not highly productive. The\r\nsocialist ignores this fact, and insists that the laborer shall\r\nreceive a share of wealth which shall be adequate to his needs. As we\r\nshall have occasion to point out in the next chapter, this attitude of\r\nthe socialist indicates a fundamental defect in his theory. Socialism\r\npays more attention to who shall eat and how much shall be eaten, than\r\nit does to the more fundamental question of how food is to be\r\nproduced, and how much can actually be produced. Laws may oblige an\r\nemployer to give his workmen twice as much as they add to the value of\r\nhis product, but though this will benefit the workmen while it lasts,\r\nsuch a practice would, if widely adopted, lead to industrial\r\nbankruptcy. [Footnote: It is assumed, in this section, that the\r\nproductivity of the laborer is determined from the point of view of\r\nthe employer. This is in accordance with the productivity theory which\r\nwas discussed in Chapter IX.]\r\n\r\n159. SOCIALIST THEORY OF VALUE UNSOUND.--Many of the defects of the\r\nsocialist doctrine are traceable to the fact that it rests upon false\r\nassumptions. One of these false assumptions is that commodities have\r\nvalue in proportion as labor has been expended upon them. This labor\r\ntheory of value has been discarded by every authoritative economist of\r\nmodern times. As has been pointed out in Chapter VIII, value depends\r\nupon scarcity and utility. The soundness of the scarcity-utility\r\ntheory, as well as the unsoundness of the labor theory, may be brought\r\nout with reference to three classes of goods.\r\n\r\nFirst, there are commodities which have value in spite of the fact\r\nthat no labor has been expended upon them. Virgin land, the gift of\r\nNature, is the most important example. Articles of this class have\r\nvalue because they satisfy men's wants, _i.e._ have utility, and\r\nbecause they are scarce. Labor has nothing to do with their original\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nSecond, there are commodities which have no value, even though much\r\nlabor has been expended upon them. A building erected in a desert or\r\nin a wilderness is an example. Unwanted books, or paintings by unknown\r\nartists are other examples. Commodities in this class may represent a\r\ngreat expenditure of labor, and still have no value, first because\r\nthey do not satisfy anyone's wants, and second because they are not\r\nscarce, _i.e._ there are not fewer of them than are wanted.\r\n\r\nThird, articles may have a value which is out of proportion to the\r\namount of labor expended upon them. The value of diamonds, old coins,\r\nand rare paintings is disproportionate to the actual amount of labor\r\ninvolved in their production. A sudden change in fashion may cause the\r\nvalue of clothing and other commodities to rise or fall, with little\r\nor no regard for the amount of labor expended upon them. In each case\r\nit is not labor that determines value, but scarcity and utility.\r\n\r\n160. LABOR NOT THE ONLY FACTOR IN PRODUCTION.--Labor is an important\r\nfactor in production, but land, capital, co÷rdination, and government\r\nare also of vital importance to any modern industrial community. The\r\ngreat error of the socialist is that he over-estimates the importance\r\nof the laborer, and minimizes or altogether denies the importance of\r\nthe individuals with whom the laborer co÷perates in production. This\r\nerror is explainable: the laborer does most of the visible and\r\nphysical work of production, while the part played by the landowner,\r\nthe capitalist, and the entrepreneur is less physical and often is\r\napparently less direct. The complexity of the industrial mechanism\r\nvery often prevents the laborer from appreciating the true relation\r\nexisting between his own physical labor, and the apparently indirect\r\nand often non-physical efforts of those who co÷perate with him. It is\r\nin this connection that producers' co÷peration and bolshevism have\r\nperformed a great service. They have demonstrated, by the out-and-out\r\nelimination of the managing employer, that the laborer alone cannot\r\ncarry on modern industry. Such actual demonstrations of the value of\r\nfactors of production other than labor are of far more service in\r\ncorrecting the viewpoint of the socialist than is any amount of\r\ntheoretical argument.\r\n\r\n161. THEORY OF CLASS STRUGGLE UNWARRANTED.--The theory of class\r\nstruggle is based upon the claim that the laborer produces all wealth.\r\nBut we have seen this claim to be unfounded; therefore the theory of\r\nclass struggle is built upon an error. Ultimately, the theory of class\r\nstruggle tends to injure the very class which seeks to gain by\r\nadvocating it, for true and permanent prosperity for the laboring\r\nclass (as well as for all other classes) can result only when all of\r\nthe factors of production work together harmoniously. Fundamentally\r\nthe quarrel between capital and labor [Footnote: The phrase \"capital\r\nand labor\" is loose and inaccurate, but is in common use. Used in this\r\nsense the word \"capital\" refers to the capitalist and employing\r\nclasses, while the word \"labor\" refers to the workers. See Section\r\n181, Chapter XVIII, for a fuller discussion.] is as suicidal as though\r\nthe arms of a human body refused to co÷perate with the other members.\r\nThere are, indeed, many antagonisms between capital and labor, but\r\nsocialism seeks to foment, rather than to eliminate them. Socialism\r\npreaches social solidarity and prosperity for all, but by inciting the\r\nclass struggle it makes for class hatred and a disharmony between\r\ncapital and labor which decreases prosperity and threatens economic\r\nruin.\r\n\r\n162. HISTORY HAS DISPROVED SOCIALISM.--Karl Marx bases his theory of a\r\nfuture socialist state upon a number of predictions, none of which has\r\ncome true. According to Marx, socialism was inevitable. He declared\r\nthat the centralization of wealth in the hands of the capitalists, on\r\nthe one hand, and the increasing misery of the workers on the other,\r\nwould accentuate the class struggle and bring about the downfall of\r\ncapitalism. As a matter of fact, laws are more and more restricting\r\nthe undue concentration of wealth in the hands of a few. The middle\r\nclasses, far from disappearing, as Marx predicted, are increasing in\r\nnumbers and in wealth. The working classes are not becoming poorer and\r\nmore miserable, but are securing a larger and larger share of the\r\njoint income of industry.\r\n\r\nThe socialist revolution came in 1917, not in the most enlightened\r\ncountry in the world, as Marx had predicted, but in Russia, one of the\r\nmost backward of civilized countries. This revolution did not\r\ndemonstrate the superiority of socialism over capitalism, but revealed\r\nthe fundamental weaknesses of socialism, and led to a more widespread\r\nrecognition of the merits of the capitalistic system.\r\n\r\nIn the progressive countries of western Europe and America, the\r\nlikelihood of a socialist revolution has been greatly diminished by\r\ntwo developments. These developments, both of which were unforeseen by\r\nMarx, are as follows: first, the improving condition of the workers\r\nhas rendered socialist doctrine less appealing; second, the increasing\r\neffectiveness of legislation designed to remedy the defects of\r\ncapitalism has caused attention to be directed to legislative reform\r\nrather than to socialism. With many who were formerly socialists, the\r\nsupreme question has become, not how to destroy the present order, but\r\nhow to aid in perfecting it by means of appropriate legislation.\r\n\r\n163. SOCIALISM CLAIMS TOO MUCH.--Socialism often appeals strongly to\r\npeople who are unable to distinguish between plans which are\r\nrealizable and promises which cannot be fulfilled. For example,\r\nsocialism promises greatly to increase the productive power of the\r\nnation, to shorten the hours of labor, and to insure a just\r\ndistribution of wealth. These reforms, it is claimed, would be\r\naccompanied by the elimination of unemployment, poverty, vice, and\r\nattendant evils. It is maintained that socialism would encourage a\r\nhigher moral tone and a healthier and more vigorous social life than\r\nnow exist.\r\n\r\nWithout doubt these are desirable aims, but we must face the hard fact\r\nthat socialism is not likely to attain them.. Some of the ills which\r\nsocialism claims to be able to cure are neither attributable to\r\ncapitalism, nor open to remedy by socialism. For example, crises and\r\nunemployment are often due to the alternations of good and bad\r\nharvests, to the varying degrees of severity in successive winters, to\r\nnew mechanical inventions, and to changes in fashion. These forces are\r\nbeyond the effective control of any state. This being so, it is unfair\r\nfor socialists to attribute their evil effects to capitalism. It is\r\nlikewise unwarranted that socialism should claim to be able\r\neffectively to control these forces.\r\n\r\nOther industrial evils are due to the infirmities of human nature, and\r\nto the fact that we are a highly civilized people living more and more\r\nunder urban conditions. Crime, vice, and disease are grave social\r\nproblems which demand solution, but it is unfair for socialism to\r\ncharge these evils against capitalism. Such defects are due partly to\r\nthe fact that we are human, and partly to the fact that much of modern\r\nlife is highly artificial. Unless socialism contemplates a return to\r\nsmall, primitive communities, there is nothing to indicate that it\r\nwould be able materially to reduce crime, vice, nervous strain, or\r\nill-health. Indeed, there is no evidence to show that socialism could\r\nmake as effective headway against these evils as we are making under\r\ncapitalism.\r\n\r\n164. DEFECTS OF SOCIALISM OUTWEIGH ITS MERITS.--It is only after the\r\nadvantages of a system or an institution have been carefully weighed\r\nagainst its disadvantages that its value appears. A socialist system\r\nwould have some obvious merits. It might eliminate unemployment, since\r\neveryone would be an employee of the state, and, as such, would be\r\nguaranteed against discharge. Charitable aid would probably be\r\nextended to many people now left to their own resources.\r\n\r\nBut certainly socialism could not cure ills which are due either to\r\nnatural causes, or to the infirmities of human nature. The abolition\r\nof private initiative and of private property would strike at the root\r\nof progress. Socialism would also probably give rise to a series of\r\nnew problems, such as the evils arising out of a bureaucratic form of\r\ngovernment. As its program now stands, it is probably fair to say that\r\nthe defects of socialism greatly outweigh its merits.\r\n\r\n165. SOCIALISM UNDER-RATES CAPITALISM.--The ardor of the socialist\r\noften causes him to underestimate the merits of capitalism, and to\r\nexaggerate its defects. The striking achievements of capitalism, so in\r\ncontrast with the negative character of socialism, are not generally\r\nappreciated by the socialist. On the other hand, the socialist places\r\nan undue emphasis upon the defects of the present system. The radical\r\nagitator too often overlooks the millions of happy, prosperous homes\r\nin this and other countries; he too often sees capitalism in terms of\r\npoverty, crises, unemployment, vice, disease, and extravagance.\r\n\r\nOur age is not to be despaired of. An age of progress is always an age\r\nof adaptation and of adjustment, and it is precisely because American\r\ndemocracy is both a progressive ideal and a living, growing\r\ninstitution that it is confronted with problems. The socialist\r\nindictment is not a prelude to chaos, for through the process of\r\nadjustment we are making steady progress in solving our problems.\r\nCapitalism has served us well, and though it has defects, these are\r\nclearly outweighed by its merits. So long as we know of no other\r\nsystem which would work better, we are justified in retaining\r\ncapitalism.\r\n\r\n166. NECESSITY OF A DEFINITE PROGRAM OF INDUSTRIAL REFORM.--Socialism\r\nappeals to certain types of people because it offers a confident\r\nprogram, even though it is a mistaken and probably a dangerous\r\nprogram. And it is the almost universal failure of non-socialists to\r\nadvance a substitute program that is responsible for a large share of\r\nthe resentment which industrial evils have aroused among non-\r\nsocialists. _If not socialism, what?_ is the cry. We are challenged to\r\nmove, to do something, to present a reform program which will justify\r\nthe rejection of socialism.\r\n\r\nLest our survey of industrial reform seem negative and devoid of\r\nconstructive elements, therefore, the next chapter will be devoted to\r\nwhat may be called a democratic program of industrial reform. The\r\nbasic idea of this program is that poverty is as unnecessary as\r\nmalaria or yellow fever, and that we can abolish poverty without\r\nsacrificing private property, personal initiative, or any of the other\r\ninstitutions which we hold dear.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS ON THE TEXT\r\n\r\n1.

THERE IS NO SIMPLE REMEDY FOR THE DEFECTS OF CAPITALISM.--The\r\neconomic system of a modern civilized nation is a vast and complicated\r\naffair, and its defects are both numerous and deep-lying. No one\r\nreally familiar with the problem would propose so simple a remedy as\r\nsocialism for so complex a disease as industrial maladjustment.\r\nHistory affords many examples of schemes that were designed to\r\neliminate poverty from the world suddenly and completely, but no such\r\nscheme has succeeded.\r\n\r\nLet it be understood at the outset of this chapter, therefore, that\r\nreally to eliminate the basic defects of our industrial system we must\r\nresort to a series of comprehensive reforms rather than to a single\r\nscheme or theory. These reforms must be so wisely planned and so\r\ncarefully executed as to attack the evils of capitalism from a number\r\nof angles simultaneously. The attack must be partly by legislative,\r\nand partly by non-legislative methods.\r\n\r\nThe series of reforms referred to above must have three aims: first,\r\nto give every individual exactly what he earns; second, to make it\r\npossible for every individual to earn enough to support himself and\r\nhis family at least decently; and third, to teach every individual to\r\nuse wisely and economically the income which he receives.\r\n\r\nA program embodying these three aims has the disadvantage of seeming\r\ncommonplace and slow of fulfillment to those who prefer novel and\r\nsensational schemes, but it has the advantage of being both workable\r\nand safe.\r\n\r\n168. THE NATURE OF JUSTICE.--Among the advocates of socialism the word\r\n\"justice\" is much used, but apparently little understood. Justice in\r\nindustry implies that every individual shall receive precisely what he\r\nearns, no more, no less. If a monopolist secures unearned profits,\r\nthere is injustice. If a laborer adds to the value of a product to the\r\nextent of five dollars, there is injustice if he receives less than\r\nfive dollars in wages. Similarly, there is injustice if the laborer\r\nearns only four dollars, but receives five dollars. Wherever there is\r\nan unfair distribution of wealth, there is a double injustice: some\r\nindividual gets a share of wealth which he did not earn and to which,\r\ntherefore, he is not entitled; while the individual who did earn that\r\nwealth is deprived of it.\r\n\r\n169. THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS.--All right-thinking reformers will agree\r\nwith the socialist that much or all of the unearned wealth of the\r\nmoneyed classes ought to be taken for the benefit of the community.\r\nBut he who accepts the democratic program of industrial reform will\r\nnot sanction the socialist's proposal to eliminate poverty primarily\r\nby decreeing higher wages.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, this proposal of the socialist is unjust. A man\r\nwho earns three dollars a day may not be able to live on that amount,\r\nand it may be desirable for some agency to give him more than three\r\ndollars a day. But that would be charity, not justice. It would be, as\r\nwe have just seen, a double injustice.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, such a practice would lead inevitably to national\r\nbankruptcy. Under the competitive system, wages tend to be determined\r\nby productivity. To attempt to eradicate poverty primarily by the\r\nraising of wages is futile, for employers cannot long pay out in wages\r\nmore than the laborer adds to the product. Some employers might do so\r\nfor a long time, and all employers might do so for a short time, but\r\nif the practice were nation-wide and long-continued, it would result\r\nin economic ruin. To put a premium upon propagation by guaranteeing\r\nevery man a job, and to pay him, not according to productivity, but\r\naccording to need, would be equivalent to building up a gigantic\r\ncharitable institution. Charity is a necessary and laudable function,\r\nbut the proper care of the dependent classes is possible only when the\r\nmajority of the people are not only self-supporting, but actually\r\nproduce a surplus out of which the unfortunate can be cared for. If\r\napplicants for charity too largely outnumber those producing a\r\nsurplus, national bankruptcy results.\r\n\r\nIn the third place, an increase in wages might not benefit even those\r\nreceiving higher wages unless they were able and willing to spend\r\ntheir income wisely and economically.\r\n\r\n170. THE REDISTRIBUTION OF UNEARNED WEALTH.--The first step in our\r\nprogram is to apply the principle of justice to the problem of\r\nunearned wealth. The student should be careful at this point to\r\ndistinguish between wealth which has been earned, however great, and\r\nwealth which has been acquired by unjust methods. American democracy\r\nwill tolerate no interference with wealth which has been earned; on\r\nthe other hand, it demands that unearned riches be redistributed in\r\nthe form of services performed by the government for the people as a\r\nwhole.\r\n\r\nThere are three chief methods of redistributing unearned wealth. The\r\nfirst is by means of increased taxes on land. As was pointed out in\r\nthe chapter on single tax, that income from land which is due, not to\r\nthe efforts of the owner, but either to natural fertility or to the\r\ngrowth of the community, may be considered as unearned. While the\r\nsingle tax is too drastic a reform, it is unquestioned that we need\r\nheavier taxes upon the unearned increment arising from land.\r\n\r\nA second method of redistributing unearned wealth is through the\r\napplication of inheritance taxes. Reserving the whole problem of\r\ntaxation for later discussion, [Footnote: See Chapter XXXII.] it may\r\nbe said here that in many cases large sums are willed to individuals\r\nwho have done little or nothing to deserve them. In so far as this is\r\ntrue, and in so far as such a tax does not discourage the activities\r\nof fortune builders, the inheritance tax is a desirable means of\r\nredistributing unearned wealth.\r\n\r\nThe last method of redistributing unearned wealth is by a tax on those\r\nelements in profits which are due to the abuse of monopoly conditions.\r\n[Footnote: Monopoly will be treated more fully in Chapters XXVII and\r\nXXVIII.] Complete monopoly rarely exists, but in many businesses there\r\nis an element of monopoly which allows the capitalist or entrepreneur\r\nto secure a measure of unearned wealth. In the interest of justice,\r\nmuch or all of this ought to be taken for the use of the community.\r\n\r\n171. SOMETHING MORE THAN JUSTICE IS NECESSARY.--It is an error to\r\nsuppose that justice would necessarily eliminate either low wages or\r\npoverty. As we have seen, justice would require the redistribution of\r\na large amount of unearned wealth. But much more important is the\r\nquestion of large numbers of laborers whose wages are undesirably low.\r\nIf the rule of justice were applied to this latter class, that is, if\r\nthey were given just what they earned, many would continue to be poor.\r\nIndeed, if justice were strictly administered, it is even possible\r\nthat among a few groups poverty would increase, since some individuals\r\nare incapable of really earning the wages they now receive.\r\n\r\nSomething more than justice, therefore, is necessary. We must not only\r\nsee that a man gets as much as he produces, no more, no less, but we\r\nmust make it possible for every individual actually to produce or earn\r\nenough to support himself decently or comfortably. This, in essence,\r\nis the distinction between the socialist and the liberalist, _i.e._ he\r\nwho accepts the democratic program of industrial reform: the socialist\r\nwould practice injustice and invite economic ruin in a vain effort to\r\neliminate poverty; the liberalist seeks the abolition of poverty\r\nwithout violating either justice or economic law.\r\n\r\n172. WHY WAGES ARE LOW.--A little thought will show that directly or\r\nindirectly poverty is sometimes the result of low wages. It follows,\r\nthus, that the source of some poverty would be dried up if an increase\r\nin wages could be secured in an economical manner. To come to the\r\nheart of the problem, wages are low because productivity is low. That\r\nis to say, employers operating under conditions of free competition\r\nwill pay laborers in proportion as the latter give promise of adding\r\nto the value of the product. When men are scarce, relatively to the\r\nsupply of land and capital, the employer will be justified in offering\r\nhigh wages, because under those circumstances the productivity of each\r\nof his prospective employees will be high. He will actually offer high\r\nwages, because if he does not, the laborers will tend to hire out to\r\nhis competitors. But if laborers are plentiful, relatively to the\r\nsupply of the other factors of production, the employer will be forced\r\nto offer lower wages, because under the circumstances each of the\r\nprospective employees shows promise of being able to add relatively\r\nlittle to the value of the product. In such a case, the employer will\r\nactually offer low wages because he need not fear that his competitors\r\nwill hire all of the laborers applying for jobs.\r\n\r\nThus when laborers are plentiful, relatively to the demand, the\r\nautomatic functioning of the law of supply and demand will result in\r\nlow wages. We need not waste time debating whether or not there ought\r\nto be such a thing as the law of supply and demand; a far more\r\nprofitable exercise is to recognize that such a law exists, and to\r\nconsider how our program of industrial reform may be adapted to it.\r\n\r\n173. AN ECONOMICAL REMEDY FOR LOW WAGES.--Low wages are generally the\r\nresult of low productivity, and low productivity is in turn the result\r\nof an oversupply of laborers relatively to the demand. Granting the\r\ntruth of these premises, an economical remedy for low wages involves\r\ntwo steps: first, the demand for labor [Footnote: By \"labor\" is here\r\nmeant those types of labor which are poorly paid, because\r\noversupplied. Unskilled day labor is an example.] must be increased;\r\nand second, the supply of labor must be decreased. Any measure which\r\nwill increase the demand for labor, relatively to the demand for the\r\nother factors of production, will increase the productivity of labor,\r\nand will justify the payment of higher wages. Competition between\r\nprospective employers will then actually force the payment of higher\r\nwages. Similarly, any measure which will decrease the supply of labor\r\nwill strengthen the bargaining position of the laborer, and, other\r\nthings remaining equal, will automatically increase wages.\r\n\r\n174. INCREASING THE DEMAND FOR LABOR.--If we bear in mind that modern\r\nindustry requires a combination of the various factors of production,\r\nit will be seen that the utilization of laborers depends upon the\r\nextent to which land, capital, and entrepreneur ability are present to\r\ncombine with those laborers. Where there is a large supply of these\r\nfactors, many laborers can be set to work. Thus one way of increasing\r\nthe demand for labor is to increase the supply of land, capital, and\r\nentrepreneur ability.\r\n\r\nThe available supply of land can be increased by several methods.\r\nIrrigation, reclamation, and dry farming increase the available supply\r\nof farm land. The fertility of land may be retained and increased by\r\nmanuring, rotation of crops, and careful husbandry. Improved\r\nagricultural machinery will also enable land to be used in larger\r\nquantities and in more productive ways. And while we do not think of\r\nman as actually creating land, the draining of swamps and the filling\r\nin of low places increases the available amount of both farm and urban\r\nland. By whatever means the amount of available land is increased, the\r\neffect is to open more avenues to the employment of laborers.\r\n\r\nThe supply of capital may be increased chiefly by the practice of\r\nthrift among all classes of the population. Capital arises most\r\nrapidly when individuals produce as much as possible, and spend as\r\nlittle as possible for consumers' goods. Any measure which will\r\ndiscourage the well-to-do from wasteful or luxurious ways of living,\r\nand at the same time encourage the poor to save systematically, even\r\nthough they save only a trifle, will add to the supply of available\r\ncapital. Every increase in the supply of capital will enable more and\r\nmore laborers to be set to work.\r\n\r\nEntrepreneur ability may be increased by a variety of methods. The\r\ntraining of men for business callings increases the supply of\r\nentrepreneurs. Taxes on inheritances, excess profits, and the unearned\r\nincrement of land will tend to force into productive work many capable\r\nmen who now either idle away their lives, or retire from business\r\nprematurely. It is also important that the well-to-do classes be\r\nencouraged to rear larger families, since it is these classes which\r\ncan best afford to give their children the higher forms of training\r\nand education. Lastly, it is desirable to teach that leisure is\r\ndisgraceful, and that whether one is rich or poor, the useful and\r\nproductive life is the moral and patriotic life. \"He who does less\r\nwell than he can does ill.\"\r\n\r\n175. DECREASING THE SUPPLY OF LABOR.--Hand in hand with measures\r\ndeigned to increase the demand for labor should go consistent efforts\r\nto decrease the supply of unskilled and poorly paid labor. One of the\r\nmost effective means of accomplishing this is to restrict by law the\r\nimmigration to this country of masses of unskilled workers which glut\r\nthe American labor market and force down the wages of unskilled\r\nworkmen already here. The general problem of immigration will be\r\ndiscussed elsewhere; here it is only necessary to note that as an\r\neconomic proposition unrestricted immigration is undesirable.\r\n\r\nThe supply of unskilled labor may be somewhat restricted by additional\r\nlaws. It is clear that we ought to pass and enforce laws which would\r\nprevent the propagation of mental defectives. There ought also to be\r\nlaws which would discourage the marriage of individuals who show no\r\npromise of being able to rear and support children who are physically\r\nfit. It might not be expedient to pass legislation requiring a certain\r\nminimum income of persons intending to marry, but from the purely\r\neconomic point of view, such laws would certainly be advisable.\r\n\r\nMuch in this general field can be done by non-legislative methods.\r\nYoung people can be taught the desirability of postponing marriage\r\nuntil their earnings justify the acceptance of such a responsibility.\r\nJust as the well-to-do should be encouraged to prefer family-building\r\nto social ambition, so the poorer classes ought to be encouraged to\r\npostpone marriage until, through education or training, the proper\r\nsupport of a family is assured. This end must be secured through moral\r\nand social education, rather than through legislation.\r\n\r\nThe encouragement of thrift among the poorer classes of the population\r\nis an important factor in decreasing the supply of unskilled labor.\r\nThrift increases savings, and by making possible education or\r\napprenticeship in a trade, it enables the children of the unskilled\r\nworker to pass from the ranks of the poorly paid to the ranks of the\r\nrelatively well paid. Thus not only does the practice of thrift by the\r\npoor add to the amount of capital in existence, and thus indirectly\r\nincrease the demand for labor, but it helps the poor directly and\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nVocational education is of fundamental importance in decreasing the\r\nsupply of unskilled labor. It renders higher wages economically\r\njustified by training individuals away from overcrowded and hence\r\npoorly paid jobs, and toward those positions in which men are scarce,\r\nand hence highly paid. If vocational education turns unskilled workmen\r\ninto entrepreneurs, such education has the doubly beneficial effect of\r\nlessening the supply of unskilled labor, and of increasing the demand\r\nfor labor. The importance of trade schools, continuation schools, and\r\nother agencies of vocational education can hardly be exaggerated.\r\n\r\nEmployment bureaus and labor exchanges are essential to the democratic\r\nprogram of industrial reform. Just as vocational education must move\r\nindividuals from overcrowded to undercrowded occupations, so the\r\nemployment bureau should move laborers from places where they are\r\nrelatively little wanted, and hence poorly paid, to places where they\r\nare relatively much wanted, and hence better paid. A co÷rdinated\r\nsystem of national, state, and municipal employment bureaus is a\r\nvaluable part of our program of industrial reform.\r\n\r\n176. IMPORTANCE OF PERSONAL EFFICIENCY.--We have seen that the\r\nbargaining position of the laborer may be strengthened by any and all\r\nmeasures which would increase the demand for his labor, relatively to\r\nthe demand for the other factors of production. As a general\r\nproposition, this strengthened position would tend automatically to\r\nresult in higher wages.\r\n\r\nAlong with these measures it should not be forgotten that the\r\nindustrial position of the individual worker tends to improve in\r\nproportion as he increases his personal efficiency. It is of the\r\ngreatest importance that the individual should strive to secure as\r\nthorough an education as possible, and that he safeguard himself\r\nagainst accident and disease. He should realize, also, that employers\r\nseek men who are not only competent, but whose personal habits are\r\nattractive and trust-inspiring. Regardless of the scarcity or\r\noversupply of labor, personal efficiency will tend to enable the\r\nworker to receive larger wages than would otherwise be possible.\r\n\r\n177. SOMETHING MORE THAN HIGH WAGES IS NECESSARY.--We have taken some\r\ntime to point out how wages might be increased without violating\r\neconomic law. But high wages do not necessarily mean the abolition of\r\npoverty, indeed, actual investigations have proved that often poverty\r\nexists regardless of whether wages are high or low. A family of four,\r\nfor example, might be well fed, comfortably clothed, and otherwise\r\ncared for in a normal manner, on, say, three dollars a day, provided\r\nthat sum were utilized wisely. A second family of equal size, however,\r\nmight spend six dollars a day so carelessly that the children would be\r\ndenied such vital necessities as medical attention and elementary\r\neducation, while neither parents nor children would be adequately\r\nprovided with food or clothing.\r\n\r\n178. INCOME MUST BE UTILIZED WISELY.--Thus an indispensable factor in\r\nthe abolition of poverty is the economical utilization of income.\r\nAside from the fact that it increases the amount of capital in\r\nexistence, thrift is imperative if a family is to get the full benefit\r\nof its income. In both the home and the school the child should be\r\ntaught the proper care and utilization of money. He should receive, in\r\naddition, fundamental instruction in such matters as expense-\r\naccounting and budget-making. Of similarly great value is the training\r\nof boys and girls to a proper appreciation of the home-making ideal,\r\nto which subject we shall return later. [Footnote: See Chapter XXIII.]\r\n\r\nIt is fortunate that we are directing more and more attention to these\r\nand similar measures, for they strike at the heart of one of the great\r\ncauses of poverty--the inability of the individual to make the proper\r\nuse of his income. Unless our citizens are trained to spend money\r\nwisely, and to distinguish clearly between the relative values of\r\nservices and commodities, an increase in wages will never eliminate\r\nmalnutrition, illiteracy, and other elements of poverty.\r\n\r\n179. SUMMARY.--For the sake of clearness, let us summarize the\r\nessential features of the democratic program of industrial reform.\r\n\r\nThe first aim of this program is to give every individual precisely\r\nwhat he earns, no more, no less. Applying the principle of justice\r\nwould result in heavy taxes on unearned wealth secured through\r\ninheritance, or as rent from land, or as monopoly profits.\r\n\r\nThe second aim of our program arises from the fact that justice might\r\nnot improve the condition of the laboring class, since some laborers\r\nmanifestly could not earn enough to support themselves and their\r\nfamilies decently.\r\n\r\nIn addition to administering justice, therefore, we must put the\r\nindividual in a position to earn an amount adequate to his needs. This\r\ninvolves two lines of action: first, the bargaining position of the\r\nlaborer must be strengthened by measures designed to increase the\r\ndemand for his labor, relatively to the demand for the other factors\r\nof production; second, increasing the personal efficiency of the\r\nworker will render him more attractive to the employer.\r\n\r\nThe third aim of the democratic program of industrial reform is to\r\nteach the individual to use his income wisely and economically. Only\r\nafter this has been done can we be assured that the raising of wages\r\nwill materially improve the condition of the worker.\r\n\r\n180. SOCIAL PROBLEMS.--There is an important word to be said here. The\r\ndemocratic program of industrial reform is economically sound, and\r\nultimately it would eliminate poverty. But it is not an immediate cure\r\nfor all of the social and economic ills of American democracy. There\r\nwill long continue to be persons whom no amount of care can render\r\ncapable of earning enough to support themselves. There are many other\r\nindividuals who may ultimately become self-supporting, but who for\r\nsome time to come will need special care and attention. There are,\r\nlastly, many other individuals who are partially or entirely self-\r\nsupporting,--women and children, for example,--but whose social and\r\neconomic interests need to be safeguarded by legislation. The\r\ndemocratic program of industrial reform could ultimately eliminate\r\nmany of the basic social problems now confronting us; meantime we are\r\nunder the necessity of grappling with such questions as labor\r\ndisputes, the risks of industry, crime, and dependency. Indeed, no\r\nmatter how vigorously and intelligently we attack the defects of\r\ncapitalism, it is probable that we shall always have to face grave\r\nsocial problems. Part III of the text will accordingly be devoted to a\r\nconsideration of American social problems.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS ON THE TEXT\r\n\r\n1.

LABOR AND CAPITAL.--Strictly speaking, five distinct factors are\r\ninvolved in production: land, labor, capital, co÷rdination, and\r\ngovernment. As a matter of fact, we are accustomed to speak of the\r\nimmediate conduct of industry as involving only two factors: labor and\r\ncapital. Used in this sense, the term labor refers to the masses of\r\nhired workmen, while the term capital is held to include not only the\r\nindividual who has money to invest, _i.e._ the capitalist proper, but\r\nalso the entrepreneur, or managing employer.\r\n\r\nLabor and capital co÷perate actively in production, while the other\r\nfactors remain somewhat in the background. As we have seen, both labor\r\nand capital are essential to industry, and fundamentally their\r\ninterests are reciprocal. But in spite of this basic harmony, there\r\nare many points of difference and antagonism between labor and\r\ncapital. This chapter discusses the more important of these\r\ndisagreements, and outlines some suggested methods of reducing or\r\neliminating them.\r\n\r\n182. THE FACTORY SYSTEM AND THE LABORER.--Wherever it has penetrated,\r\nthe Industrial Revolution has concentrated large numbers of landless\r\nlaborers in industrial establishments controlled by relatively few\r\nemployers. Very early in the development of the factory system, the\r\nlaborer saw that he was at a relative disadvantage in bargaining with\r\nemployers. Not only does the average laborer lack funds to tide him\r\nover a long period of unemployment, but the fact that his labor is\r\ngenerally his sole reliance obliges him to secure work at all hazards.\r\nThe anxiety and discontent of laborers have been increased by the\r\nrealization that the factory system affords little opportunity for the\r\naverage workman to rise to the position of an employer. Most laborers\r\nare unable to secure either the training or the capital necessary to\r\nset themselves up as independent business men.\r\n\r\n183. RISE OF LABOR ORGANIZATIONS.--The risks and limitations which the\r\nfactory system imposes upon the laboring classes have encouraged\r\nworkmen to organize for the purpose of promoting their mutual\r\ninterests. The individual gains, it has been found, when his interests\r\nare supported by a group of workmen acting as a unit, and bringing\r\ntheir united pressure to bear upon the employer. The labor\r\norganization has been the result of this discovery. A labor\r\norganization may be defined as a more or less permanent and continuous\r\nassociation of wage earners, entered into for the purpose of improving\r\nthe conditions of their employment.\r\n\r\nThe first labor organizations in the United States were formed early\r\nin the nineteenth century, but it was not until about 1850 that the\r\ntrade union assumed national importance. After 1850, however, and\r\nparticularly after the Civil War, the trade union grew rapidly. In\r\n1881 a number of national trade unions combined to form the American\r\nFederation of Labor. This body, while exercising no real authority\r\nover the trade unions comprising it, is nevertheless an important\r\nagency in co÷rdinating trade union policies throughout the country. It\r\nis important, also, as a means of formulating and expressing the aims\r\nand ideals of the working classes. The Federation had a membership of\r\n2,604,701 in 1914, and in 1920 included more than 4,500,000 members.\r\nWith the exception of the railroad brotherhoods, nearly all of the\r\nimportant trade unions in the country are affiliated with the American\r\nFederation of Labor.\r\n\r\n184. RISE OF EMPLOYERS' ASSOCIATIONS.--The growing power of the trade\r\nunion after 1850 stimulated the growth of employers' associations. In\r\n1886 the first national employers' association was organized under the\r\nname of the Stove Founders' National Defence Association. Later there\r\nwas formed a number of other important associations, including the\r\nNational Association of Manufacturers, the National Council for\r\nIndustrial Defence, and the American Anti-Boycott Association.\r\n\r\nThe primary purpose of the employers' association is the protection of\r\nthe employers' interests against trade union aggression. Some of the\r\nassociations are frankly hostile to the trade union movement, while\r\nothers take the stand that the organization of laborers is undesirable\r\nonly if the power of the trade union is abused. The promotion of\r\nfriendly relations between labor and capital is increasingly an\r\nimportant concern of the employers' association.\r\n\r\n185. WHAT THE TRADE UNION WANTS.--One of the basic aims of the trade\r\nunion is either to raise wages or to prevent their reduction. Because\r\nof the constant shiftings of supply and demand, the prices of\r\ncommodities are rarely stationary for very long. Over any extended\r\nperiod of time prices are either rising or falling. During a period of\r\nrising prices the workmen are at a relative disadvantage, [Footnote:\r\nRising prices affect all who purchase commodities, of course, but here\r\nwe are intent upon the position of the laborer only.] because they\r\nhave to pay for commodities higher prices than they had anticipated\r\nwhen they contracted to work for a definite wage. In such a case, the\r\nunion attempts to secure higher wages for its members. When, on the\r\nother hand, prices are falling, the workmen gain, because they do not\r\nhave to pay as high prices as they had anticipated. In this latter\r\ncase, the laborers attempt to maintain their advantage by opposing any\r\nreduction in wages.\r\n\r\nThe desire of the trade unions to improve the general condition of the\r\nworking classes has steadily widened the program of organized labor.\r\nShorter hours and better conditions of work are important trade union\r\ndemands. Unions quite generally approve the principle of a minimum\r\nwage, [Footnote: The principle of the minimum wage is discussed in the\r\nnext chapter, Sections 205-207.] at least for women and child workers.\r\nFormerly, and to some extent even now, the unions have opposed the\r\nintroduction of labor-saving machinery on the grounds that it\r\ndisplaces workmen and hence causes unemployment. Union members\r\ngenerally prefer to be paid by the hour or by the day, rather than so\r\nmuch per unit of product. The reason given for the preference is that\r\nstrain and undue fatigue often result from _piece-work,_ as the system\r\nof pay on the basis of units of product is called. Trade unions\r\nuniversally demand that employers recognize the principle of\r\ncollective bargaining, by which is meant the privilege of workmen\r\ndealing with the employer collectively or through the union. Very\r\noften, also, the unions demand the closed shop, that is to say, a shop\r\nfrom which all non-union employees are excluded.\r\n\r\n186. WHAT THE EMPLOYER WANTS.--Price movements likewise affect the\r\nemployer. But whereas the laborer is at a relative disadvantage when\r\nprices are rising, the employer tends to gain, for the reason that he\r\nsecures for his product higher prices than he had expected. [Footnote:\r\nIn a period of rising prices, the employer's costs also tend to rise,\r\nbut generally not so rapidly as do prices.] Suppose, for example that\r\na shoe manufacturer can make a profit if a pair of shoes sells for\r\n$4.00. If later the price rises to $5.00 and his expenses remain\r\nstationary or very nearly so, he reaps an unusually large profit. And\r\nwhereas in a period of falling prices the laborer tends to gain, the\r\nemployer often loses heavily, for the reason that he must sell at a\r\nrelatively low price goods produced at a relatively high cost. If, in\r\nthe case given above, the price of the pair of shoes falls from $4.00\r\nto $3.00, while the expenses of the manufacturer remain stationary, or\r\nvery nearly so, he may make little or no profit. Thus while prices are\r\nrising the employer attempts to maintain his advantage by resisting an\r\nincrease in wages, while in a period of falling prices he seeks to cut\r\ndown his expenses by reducing wages. In either case the immediate\r\ninterests of workmen and employer are antagonistic.\r\n\r\nJust as the growing complexity of the industrial situation has\r\nenlarged the trade union program, so the aims of employers have\r\nsteadily increased in number and in importance. On the grounds that it\r\nrestricts the fullest utilization of his plant, the employer very\r\noften objects to a shortening of the working day, even where there is\r\na corresponding decrease in the day-wage. Some employers are unwilling\r\nto provide sanitary workshops for their employees, or otherwise to\r\nimprove the conditions of employment. The employer generally objects\r\nto the minimum wage, as constituting an interference with his \"right\"\r\nto offer workmen what wages he chooses. Collective bargaining is\r\naccepted by many employers, but many others insist upon the right to\r\nhire and discharge men as they see fit, without being forced to\r\nconsider the wishes of the union. Employers often oppose the closed\r\nshop, and insist upon the open shop, an open shop being defined as one\r\nin which workmen are employed without regard to whether or not they\r\nare members of a union.\r\n\r\n187. METHODS OF INDUSTRIAL WARFARE.--Both capital and labor back up\r\ntheir demands by a powerful organization using a variety of weapons.\r\nThe trade union generally attempts to enforce its demands by threat\r\nof, or use of, the _strike_. A strike is a concerted stoppage of work\r\ninitiated by the workmen as a group. Sometimes accompanying the strike\r\nis the _boycott_, which may be defined as a concerted avoidance of\r\nbusiness relations with one or more employers, or with those who\r\nsympathize with those employers. The strike is generally accompanied\r\nby the practice of _picketing_, by which is meant the posting of union\r\nagents whose duty it is to attempt to persuade non-union workmen not\r\nto fill the places of the striking workmen. Pickets may also attempt\r\nto persuade customers not to patronize the employer against whom a\r\nstrike has been launched. Sometimes picketing leads to _intimidation\r\nand violence_ on the part of either strikers or representatives of the\r\nemployers.\r\n\r\nIn turn, the employer may employ a variety of weapons against workmen\r\nwith whom he cannot agree. An employer may make use of the _lockout_,\r\nthat is, he may refuse to allow his labor force to continue at work.\r\nMany employers also use the _blacklist_,  _i.e._ the circulation of\r\ninformation among employers for the purpose of forewarning one another\r\nagainst the employment of certain designated workmen. The employer may\r\nalso attempt to end a strike by persuading non-union men to fill the\r\nplaces vacated by the strikers. Such men as accept are known as\r\n_strike-breakers_. On the plea that the strike may result in the\r\ndestruction of his property, the employer may resort to the\r\n_injunction_. This is an order secured from a court, and restraining\r\ncertain laborers in the employer's interest.\r\n\r\n188. THE COST OF INDUSTRIAL WARFARE.--The struggles of labor against\r\ncapital constitute a species of warfare which involves the general\r\npublic. Regardless of whether a particular dispute ends in favor of\r\nthe laborers or the employer, every strike, lockout, or other\r\ninterference with industrial co÷peration lessens the amount of\r\nconsumable goods in existence. Thus aside from the fact that\r\nindustrial warfare encourages class antagonisms, it is an important\r\ncause of the relative scarcity of goods, and the resulting tendency of\r\nprices to rise. Often great injury results from a dispute which\r\noriginally was of small proportions. In 1902, for example, the\r\nanthracite coal strike cost the country more than $100,000,000, though\r\nthe strike had been initiated because of a local dispute over\r\nrecognition of the union. In 1919, when we were suffering from a\r\ngeneral scarcity of goods, there occurred in this country more than\r\nthree thousand strikes, involving a loss of more than $2,000,000,000\r\nin decreased production.\r\n\r\n189. NECESSITY OF INDUSTRIAL PEACE.--Industrial warfare very often\r\nresults in the correction of abuses, but in many cases it seems to\r\nbring little or no benefit to either labor or capital. In any case, it\r\nis a costly method, and one which constitutes a menace to the peace of\r\nthe community. American democracy demands that in the settlement of\r\ndisputes between labor and capital, industrial warfare be replaced by\r\nsome method less costly, less violent, and more in harmony with the\r\nprinciples of justice and civilized behavior. Responsibility for the\r\npresent extent of industrial warfare cannot definitely be placed upon\r\neither capital or labor, but at least both sides should be obliged to\r\nrecognize that the public is a third party to every industrial\r\ndispute. We should insist upon fair play for both capital and labor,\r\nbut we should likewise insist that the interests of the public be\r\nsafeguarded.\r\n\r\n190. SOME METHODS OF INDUSTRIAL PEACE.--As has already been pointed\r\nout, profit sharing is not of great importance in lessening industrial\r\nunrest. Various systems of bonuses and pensions have temporarily\r\nimproved the position of some groups of workmen, but experience has\r\nproven both bonuses and pensions to be limited in scope. Employers are\r\noften unwilling to adopt such devices as these, while the laborers\r\nfrequently regard them as paternalistic measures which at best are a\r\npoor substitute for the higher wages to which they consider themselves\r\nentitled. Existing evils are often lessened by welfare work, which\r\nincludes such measures as the establishment of schools, libraries, and\r\nplaygrounds for the laborers. But in many cases welfare work is\r\ninitiated by the employer for the purpose of diverting the attention\r\nof the workmen from their fundamental grievances, and for this reason\r\nit is often opposed by the workmen. All of the measures enumerated in\r\nthis section are of more or less value, but as methods of combating\r\nindustrial warfare, they have proved to be palliative, rather than\r\nremedial or preventive.\r\n\r\n191. THE TRADE AGREEMENT.--In some industries there is a growing\r\ntendency for employers not only to recognize the union, but also to\r\nmake a collective contract, or trade agreement, with the unionized\r\nworkmen. The trade agreement may lead to the formation of councils in\r\nwhich representatives of both workmen and employer attempt to reach a\r\nfriendly agreement upon disputed matters. The trade agreement has been\r\nparticularly successful in many industries in England. In this country\r\nit is best known in the soft coal mining industry in eastern United\r\nStates, and in the needle trades of New York City. On the whole, the\r\ntrade agreement has not been markedly successful in the United States.\r\nAlthough it smoothes out minor differences, the unions still prefer to\r\nback their more important demands by use of the strike.\r\n\r\n192. VOLUNTARY ARBITRATION.--Since 1898 the several states have been\r\ngiving an increasing amount of attention to the creation of boards of\r\nindustrial conciliation, mediation, and arbitration. [Footnote: The\r\nwords conciliation, mediation, and arbitration are variously used, but\r\nthe following distinction may be of use. Mediation is an attempt to\r\nget the disputants to come together for the purpose of discussing\r\ntheir grievances. Conciliation is aid extended to the disputants in\r\nthe actual settlement of the dispute. Arbitration implies that a third\r\nparty settles the dispute and renders a decision.] Most states now\r\nhave some provision for a board whose duty it is to attempt to\r\neliminate industrial warfare. The powers and duties of these boards\r\nvary from state to state. In some states the board may investigate\r\nlabor disputes on its own initiative, but it is not obliged to make an\r\ninvestigation. In other states the investigation of industrial\r\ndisputes is compulsory.\r\n\r\nBoards of the type discussed in this section have no power to _compel_\r\nthe disputants to arbitrate their troubles, though they may _persuade_\r\nthe parties involved to resort to arbitration. When the disputants\r\nagree to allow the state board to arbitrate the dispute, and when also\r\nthey previously promise to abide by the decision of the board, the\r\naward of the state board is binding upon both sides. When the parties\r\nto the dispute have not previously agreed to abide by the award, the\r\nboard cannot force an acceptance of its decision, but can only rely\r\nupon public sentiment to help effect a just settlement.\r\n\r\n193. COMPULSORY ARBITRATION IN NEW ZEALAND AND AUSTRALIA.--The\r\nfrequent refusal of labor and capital willingly to submit their\r\ndifferences to arbitration has led to the development of the principle\r\nof compulsory arbitration.\r\n\r\nIn New Zealand, compulsory arbitration was adopted as early as 1894.\r\nIn that country the arbitrating body is known as the court of\r\narbitration, the decisions of which are absolute and binding. At the\r\ndiscretion of the court, the awards handed down may be extended to\r\nembrace other employees or employers in the same trade, or in the same\r\nlocality, or in the whole country. Violations of the award, either by\r\nlabor or by capital, are punishable by heavy fines. An even more\r\ndrastic form of compulsory arbitration has been adopted in Australia.\r\n\r\nDue to the influence of many complicating factors, the status of\r\ncompulsory arbitration in these two countries is uncertain. Many\r\nstudents of the question maintain that this form of arbitration has\r\nmaterially reduced industrial warfare; on the other hand, other\r\nauthorities declare that compulsory arbitration in New Zealand and\r\nAustralia has not markedly improved industrial relations.\r\n\r\n194. COMPULSORY ARBITRATION IN THE UNITED STATES.--Although the\r\nprinciple of compulsory arbitration has been familiar to American\r\nstudents of labor problems for more than a quarter of a century, there\r\nis as yet very little sentiment in favor of its application to\r\nindustrial disputes in this country. The explanation of this is not\r\nfar to seek. Individualism is so strong in the United States that\r\ncompulsory arbitration is regarded by many Americans as an unwarranted\r\ninterference in private business. It is still generally true that both\r\nlabor and capital prefer to settle their disputes in open struggle.\r\nEqually important, perhaps, is the feeling that compulsory arbitration\r\nlaws would nullify the constitutional guarantee that no citizen shall\r\nbe deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.\r\n[Footnote: For an explanation of this point, see Chapter XIX, Section\r\n214.]\r\n\r\nHowever, a definite step toward compulsory arbitration was taken when\r\nin 1920 the State of Kansas established a Court of Industrial\r\nRelations \"for the purpose of preserving the public peace, protecting\r\nthe public health, preventing industrial strife, disorder, and waste,\r\nand securing regular and orderly conduct of the businesses directly\r\naffecting the living conditions of the people.\" The law of 1920\r\ndeclared illegal the suspension of work in those industries which are\r\ndesignated as essential and necessary to the community life.\r\nIndustrial disputes arising in such industries are subject to\r\ncompulsory arbitration by the court. The merits of this court are\r\nstill being debated. Some authorities declare that the court has\r\nalready demonstrated its value, but other observers claim that so far\r\nthis tribunal has not operated to reduce labor troubles in Kansas.\r\n\r\n195. STATUS OF THE DEMANDS OF LABOR.--For a number of years the\r\nattitude of labor has been clearly aggressive, while the attitude of\r\ncapital has tended to be one of resistance. In view of this fact, the\r\nsimplest way of considering the merits of the industrial situation is\r\nto examine the demands of labor. The justice of these demands cannot\r\nbe gone into here, but a few words of general application may be\r\nhelpful.\r\n\r\nThe proper determination of wages depends, of course, upon the\r\nparticular circumstances. No general rule can be laid down, except the\r\nvery obvious one that wages cannot permanently go so high as to wipe\r\nout profits in an industry, nor yet so low as to render it impossible\r\nfor the workmen to secure a decent living.\r\n\r\nThe steady improvement of living and working conditions is desirable,\r\nand is a challenge to any progressive society.\r\n\r\nShorter work hours are desirable, wherever the cutting down of the\r\nworking day does not too greatly hamper production. Many economists\r\nfeel that an eight-hour day will prove a social gain only if\r\nintroduced gradually. They believe that it should be introduced in\r\nproportion as the industrial productivity of the country increases to\r\ncompensate for the shortening of the working day.\r\n\r\nOpposition to the introduction of labor-saving machinery is both\r\nuseless and short-sighted. The officials of most unions now advise\r\nworkmen not to oppose the adoption of machinery, but rather to fit\r\nthemselves to operate the machines.\r\n\r\nThe question of a closed shop or an open shop is largely a matter of\r\nopinion. The problem will probably continue to be disputed for a long\r\ntime to come. Many students of labor conditions feel that the closed\r\nshop is justifiable only when accompanied by the open union. By an\r\nopen union is meant a union into which all laborers competent to do\r\nthe work are admitted freely. Where the open union principle is\r\nadopted, Professor Taussig points out, the closed shop is no longer a\r\nmonopolistic device to shut out competition and raise wages for a\r\nsmall group. It becomes, instead, a means of promoting mutual aid and\r\ncollective bargaining.\r\n\r\nMany employers still refuse to recognize the principle of collective\r\nbargaining, but from the social point of view collective bargaining is\r\ndesirable. In many cases it so strengthens the position of the\r\nlaborers that they are able to compete with the employer more nearly\r\non terms of equality. Under such conditions competition in the labor\r\nmarket is in a healthy state. The difficulty is, of course, that some\r\nunions may take advantage of their strengthened position to enforce\r\nunduly severe conditions upon the employer.\r\n\r\n196. THE OUTLOOK.--Although it is probable that industrial\r\ndisagreements will long endure, we have a right to expect that\r\ncontinued progress will be made in settling these disputes peaceably.\r\nBy many it is believed that compulsory arbitration is the most\r\neffective method of securing industrial peace, but for reasons already\r\ngiven, the extension of this form of arbitration will probably be slow\r\nin this country. English experience would indicate that we have not\r\nyet exhausted the possibilities of the trade agreement, but though\r\nthis device is becoming better known in the United States, both the\r\nAmerican laborer and the American employer are still disposed to\r\nsettle their differences by means of the strike, the lockout, and\r\nsimilar weapons.\r\n\r\nThe present century is an age of industrial stress and change, and it\r\nis possible that the ultimate solution of the disputes between labor\r\nand capital has not yet been advanced. From the data now at hand,\r\nhowever, it is maintained by many that labor disputes must ultimately\r\nbe eradicated through the development of industrial democracy.\r\nIndustrial democracy implies the joint direction of industrial\r\npolicies by employer and employees, working together harmoniously and\r\nin the spirit of equality. When industrial democracy is attained,\r\naccording to this view, mutual trust and the spirit of friendly\r\nco÷peration will enable labor and capital to adjust their differences\r\npeaceably and economically, without dictation from any outside source.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS ON THE TEXT\r\n\r\n1.

INDUSTRY AND HEALTH.--Wherever the Industrial Revolution has\r\nprogressed beyond the initial stages, there has been an enormous\r\nincrease in wealth and prosperity. At the same time, serious evils\r\nhave accompanied the transition from a relatively simple agricultural\r\nstage to a stage dominated by the factory system. The tendency toward\r\novercrowding in rapidly growing cities, the difficulties of\r\nmaintaining a normal family life where mother or children are employed\r\nin factories, and the danger of overstrain, accident and disease in\r\nindustrial pursuits, all these factors render very important the\r\nproblem of health in industry.\r\n\r\nThough health in industry is only one phase of the general problem of\r\nhealth, it will be impossible here to exhaust even that one phase. We\r\nshall accordingly confine ourselves to the discussion of three\r\nquestions: first, child labor; second, the employment of women in\r\nindustrial pursuits; and third, the insurance of our industrial\r\npopulation against accident, sickness, old age and unemployment.\r\n\r\n198. CHILD LABOR: EXTENT AND CAUSES.--There are in this country more\r\nthan two million children between the ages of ten and fifteen, engaged\r\nin gainful occupations. In all sections of the country large numbers\r\nof children are found in agriculture, this industry generally being\r\nbeyond the scope of child labor laws. The employment of children in\r\nfactories, mines, quarries, mills, and shops, on the other hand, is\r\nnow considerably restricted by law. This is true of all parts of the\r\ncountry. However, child labor is still of wide extent in the United\r\nStates, due to the large number of children found in agriculture,\r\ndomestic service, street trades, stores, messenger service, and\r\ntenement homework.\r\n\r\nOf the immediate causes of child labor one of the most important is\r\nthe poverty of the parents. Where the parents are themselves day\r\nlaborers, it is often considered necessary or desirable to increase\r\nthe family earnings by putting the children to work.\r\n\r\nFrom the standpoint of the employer child labor is rendered possible\r\nand even desirable by the development of types of work easily\r\nperformed by small children. In many cases the tendency of parents to\r\nput young children to work is encouraged by the lax administration of\r\nschool attendance laws. This tendency has also been encouraged by the\r\nindifference of the public to the evil effects of child labor.\r\n\r\n199. EFFECTS OF CHILD LABOR.--Students of the problem of child labor\r\nunanimously condemn the practice of habitually employing young\r\nchildren outside the home. Where poorly paid children compete with men\r\nand women, they serve either to displace adults, or, by competition,\r\nto lower the wages of adults.\r\n\r\nThe effects upon the children themselves are injurious. Stunted,\r\ncrippled, and diseased bodies are the result of steady work at too\r\ntender an age. Schooling is interrupted, so that child workers\r\ngenerally develop into illiterate and inefficient adults. When\r\nchildren are forced into gainful occupations at an early age, the\r\nfamily life is disrupted, and proper home training is difficult, if\r\nnot impossible. Still another factor is the greater temptation to vice\r\nand crime confronting the child outside the home.\r\n\r\n200. CHILD LABOR LAWS.--Since 1870 the growing acuteness of the child\r\nlabor problem, together with an aroused public opinion, has served to\r\nincrease the number of laws restricting child labor. At the present\r\ntime, forty-five states forbid the employment in certain industries of\r\nchildren under fourteen years of age.\r\n\r\nA Federal child labor law was passed in 1916, but two years later the\r\nmeasure was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. [Footnote:\r\nFor an explanation of this point, see Section 214 of this chapter.] In\r\n1919 a new Federal law was enacted. In order to avoid the charge of\r\nunconstitutionality, this measure attacks child labor _indirectly_.\r\nThe law levies an excise tax of ten per cent on the entire net profits\r\nreceived from the sale of all the products of any mine, quarry, mill,\r\ncannery, workshop, factory, or manufacturing establishment, which\r\nemploys children contrary to certain age and hour specifications. The\r\neffect of this ten per cent tax is so to reduce the profits of the\r\nemployers affected, as virtually to prohibit child labor. By this\r\nmeans the act prohibits child labor in several important groups of\r\nindustrial establishments.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty with the law is that it touches only about fifteen per\r\ncent of our two million child workers. It does not affect, for\r\nexample, the large number of children employed in agriculture,\r\ndomestic service, street trades, stores and restaurants, messenger\r\nservice, and tenement homework.\r\n\r\n201. MINIMUM PROVISIONS OF A GOOD CHILD LABOR LAW.--The passage of\r\nmore comprehensive child labor laws is being advocated by a number of\r\nsocial agencies, notably by the National Child Labor Committee. The\r\nminimum provisions of a good child labor law have been set forth by\r\nthe committee somewhat as follows:\r\n\r\nAs a general proposition, no child should be regularly employed in a\r\ngainful occupation who is under sixteen years of age. There should be\r\nan even higher age limit for child workers in quarries, mines, and\r\nother dangerous places. Children should not work more than eight hours\r\na day. Nor should they be allowed to engage in night work until they\r\nhave reached the age of, say, twenty years. All child applicants for\r\nindustrial positions should first be required to pass educational\r\ntests and a physical examination. A good child labor law should\r\nprovide for a corps of factory inspectors, as well as for other means\r\nof securing the efficient administration of the law. Lastly, it is\r\nimportant that there be close co÷peration between employers and the\r\nschool authorities in the matter of child labor.\r\n\r\n202. INCREASED NUMBER OF WOMEN IN INDUSTRY.--There have always been\r\nwomen in industry, but of recent years the proportion of women so\r\nengaged has increased so rapidly as to create a serious social\r\nproblem. From needlework, domestic service, and teaching, women have\r\nspread rapidly into trade, commerce, and the professions. A few years\r\nago transportation and police work were monopolized by men, but to-day\r\nwomen are entering these fields rapidly. Though they outnumber men\r\nonly in domestic and personal service, women are numerous in\r\npractically every important calling except plumbing and street\r\ncleaning. Altogether more than 8,000,000 women are engaged in gainful\r\noccupations in the United States.\r\n\r\n203. WHY WOMEN RECEIVE LOWER WAGES THAN MEN.--Women generally receive\r\nlower wages than men. One reason for this is the physical weakness of\r\nwomen, which renders them less desirable in many types of work. Social\r\nconventions, home attachments, and, often, the lack of the venturesome\r\nspirit, combine to keep women from moving about in search of improved\r\nworking conditions to the same extent as men. The expectation of\r\nmarriage causes many young women to neglect to increase their\r\nefficiency, and this at least prevents their wages from increasing as\r\nrapidly as those of young men who undergo consistent training. The\r\ntrade union is still little developed among women workers, a factor\r\nwhich often prevents higher wages from being secured. Low wages are\r\noften traceable to the fact that there is an over supply of girls and\r\nwomen in the labor market. Large numbers of girls and women are\r\npartially supported at home, and are able and willing to work for\r\n\"pin-money\" only. Many employers take advantage of this fact to offer\r\nvery low wages.\r\n\r\n204. LEGISLATION REGULATING THE LABOR OF WOMEN.--Although it would\r\nseem desirable to keep young children out of industry altogether,\r\nthere is a general agreement among students of the problem that the\r\nlabor of women ought to be further regulated rather than actually\r\nprohibited. A number of states have already enacted laws designed to\r\nsafeguard women in industry. In some states the number of working\r\nhours for women has been cut from eleven to nine, while in other\r\nstates the maximum number of hours during which women may work is\r\neight. Some states prohibit night work for women in industrial\r\nestablishments. The great majority of the states now provide for\r\nproper rest periods, guarded machinery, the ventilation of workrooms,\r\nand, where practicable, seats for women employees. To the extent that\r\nwomen actually do the same amount and quality of work as men, there is\r\na growing feeling that men and women ought to receive equal pay.\r\n\r\n205. THE MINIMUM WAGE.--A minimum wage law is one which specifies that\r\nin certain occupations laborers may not be paid less than a stipulated\r\nwage. The aim of the minimum wage is to protect the laborer against\r\nemployment which, under freely competitive conditions, does not pay\r\nwages high enough to guarantee a decent living.\r\n\r\nThe first minimum wage law in the United States was passed by\r\nMassachusetts in 1912. The movement grew rapidly, and by 1921 more\r\nthan a dozen additional states had adopted minimum wage laws. In some\r\nstates the law applies only to specified industries; in others it\r\ncovers all occupations. In some states the law covers only the\r\nemployment of women, but in most cases the principle of the minimum\r\nwage applies to women and minors under eighteen, or even twenty-one\r\nyears of age. In some foreign countries the minimum wage is also\r\nextended to the labor of men, but in the United States men are\r\neverywhere exempted from the operation of such laws.\r\n\r\n206. ARGUMENTS IN FAVOR OF THE MINIMUM WAGE.--The champions of the\r\nprinciple of the minimum wage advance a number of arguments in its\r\nfavor. It is contended that no industry is socially desirable if it\r\ncannot pay a living wage, for when wages fall below a certain minimum,\r\npoverty, ill-health, and vice are natural results. When laborers are\r\nthemselves unable to improve their economic position, it is said, it\r\nbecomes the duty of the state to guarantee them a living wage. Another\r\nargument in favor of the minimum wage is that it not only eliminates\r\nconsiderable poverty, but it makes possible a healthier and more\r\ncontented labor force. It is claimed that strikes and social unrest\r\nare partially eliminated by the minimum wage.\r\n\r\n207. ARGUMENTS AGAINST THE MINIMUM WAGE.--In spite of the rapid spread\r\nof minimum wage legislation in this country, the principle has met\r\nwith considerable opposition. It is claimed by some that where poverty\r\nis due to bad personal habits, the mere payment of a higher wage will\r\nnot abolish poverty. It is also urged that because of price changes,\r\nand because of differing concepts of a standard of living, it is\r\ndifficult to determine what is really a living wage. Some employers\r\nmaintain that the minimum wage is contrary to economic law, since it\r\nforces the payment of a wage which the laborer often does not earn.\r\nThe compulsory nature of the minimum wage is also opposed on the\r\ngrounds that it constitutes an undue interference with individual\r\nrights. [Footnote: Formerly an important argument against the minimum\r\nwage was this: There are large numbers of people who cannot _earn_ the\r\nminimum wage, and because employers will tend not to employ them, such\r\npersons will have to be supported by charity. The force of this\r\nargument is reduced, however, by the fact that most minimum wage laws\r\nnow make special provision for the part-time employment of such\r\npersons.]\r\n\r\n208. THE RISKS OF INDUSTRY.--In spite of the fact that most States now\r\nhave detailed laws providing for the guarding of machinery and the\r\nsupervision of dangerous occupations, a half million persons are\r\ninjured or killed annually in industrial employments in the United\r\nStates. A considerable amount of ill-health is traceable to working\r\nwith drugs and acids. Continued work in dusty mills and shops, as well\r\nas long exposure to the excessively dry or excessively moist\r\natmosphere required by certain manufacturing processes, also give rise\r\nto \"occupational\" diseases. Old age frequently brings poverty and\r\ndistress, in spite of a life of hard work. Lastly, the laborer runs\r\nthe risk of unemployment.\r\n\r\n209. THE PRINCIPLE OF SOCIAL INSURANCE.--As a general rule, laborers\r\ndo not voluntarily insure themselves against illness, unemployment,\r\naccident, or old age. This is partly because they lack the necessary\r\nfunds, and partly because they lack the foresight necessary for such\r\naction. If, therefore, the risks of industry are adequately to be\r\ninsured against, the initiative must be taken by some one other than\r\nthe laborer. As a result of this situation, there has developed the\r\nprinciple of social insurance. Social insurance, as distinguished from\r\ninsurance by trade unions or private agencies, is compulsory, and is\r\nadministered, or at least supervised, by the state or Federal\r\nauthorities.\r\n\r\nFrom the standpoint of the community, social insurance may be\r\njustified on four grounds. First, the risks of industry are largely\r\nbeyond the control of the individual workman, and hence he ought not\r\nto be held wholly responsible for the penalties which industry may\r\ninflict upon him. Second, the community gets the benefit of the\r\nlaborer's efforts, and thus ought to feel morally obligated to\r\nsafeguard his employment. Third, an injury to the laborer restricts\r\nthe productivity of the community by crippling or removing one of its\r\nproductive agents. Fourth, compulsory insurance is a social necessity,\r\nfor where nothing has been laid aside for a rainy day, the\r\ninterruption of earnings subjects the laborer and his family to\r\nhardship and disaster. Wisely administered social insurance prevents a\r\ngreat deal of poverty and distress which would otherwise constitute an\r\nadded burden upon charitable organizations.\r\n\r\n210. INSURANCE AGAINST ACCIDENT.--Accident insurance has been a\r\nfeature of social insurance programs in Germany, France, and Great\r\nBritain for almost a half century, but in this country it was not\r\nuntil 1910 that compulsory insurance against industrial accidents\r\nbegan to be effective. Since 1910, however, the movement has grown\r\nrapidly, and at the present time the majority of the states provide\r\nfor compensation to workmen for accidents sustained in connection with\r\ntheir work. Formerly our courts quite generally held that when a\r\nworkman could be shown to have suffered an accident because of\r\n\"personal negligence,\" the injured person was not entitled to\r\ncompensation. Under the accident insurance laws of most states it is\r\nnow held, however, that the personal negligence of the injured workman\r\ndoes not forfeit his right to receive compensation.\r\n\r\nIn most states the cost of accident insurance is borne primarily by\r\nthe employer.\r\n\r\n211. INSURANCE AGAINST SICKNESS. [Footnote: Sometimes known as health\r\ninsurance.]--Compulsory sickness insurance has been highly developed\r\nin several European countries, but so far we have left insurance of\r\nthis type to private effort. The question is attracting considerable\r\nattention in this country, however, and it is believed that this form\r\nof social insurance will soon be provided for by state law. In 1914\r\nthe American Association for Labor Legislation outlined a model\r\nsickness insurance law. Such a law would provide a sickness benefit\r\nfor a number of weeks, arrange for medical care, and, in case of\r\ndeath, pay a funeral benefit. The cost of such insurance would be\r\ndivided equally between workmen and employer, while the state would\r\nbear the cost of administering the law. This cost would be\r\nconsiderable, because illness may be feigned, and hence there would\r\nhave to be more careful supervision than in the case of accident\r\ninsurance.\r\n\r\n212. INSURANCE AGAINST OLD AGE.--Compulsory insurance against old age\r\nis an important feature of social insurance systems in European\r\ncountries, but it is very little known in the United States. We are\r\nfamiliar with the Federal pensioning of military veterans, and with\r\nlocal pensions for firemen and policemen, as well as with state and\r\nlocal pensions for teachers. Such insurance does not, however, touch\r\nthe question of aged employees in industrial pursuits. Trade unions\r\nsometimes provide a measure of old age insurance for their members,\r\nbut the proportion of workmen affected by this practice is very small.\r\n\r\nIn 1920, a beginning toward compulsory old age insurance was made,\r\nwhen a Federal law provided for compulsory old age insurance for the\r\ncivil service employees of the Federal government. The question of\r\ncompulsory old age insurance is also being agitated in a number of\r\nstates.\r\n\r\n213. SHOULD SOCIAL INSURANCE EXTEND TO UNEMPLOYMENT?--It is contended\r\nby many that to insure workmen against the loss of their jobs would\r\nencourage shiftlessness, and that for this reason the principle of\r\nsocial insurance ought not to apply to unemployment.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that a considerable share of unemployment is traceable\r\nto personal negligence, and it is probably true that insurance against\r\nunemployment would discourage thrift and foresight on the part of many\r\nworkmen. On the other hand, it has been shown statistically that a\r\nlarge share of unemployment is due to crop failures, market\r\nfluctuations, and other conditions beyond the control of the workmen.\r\nIn so far as this is true, there would be a great deal of unemployment\r\nwhether it were insured against or not. Because, therefore, some\r\nunemployment is inevitable, and because unemployment is in many cases\r\nbeyond the control of the individual, it becomes necessary, or at\r\nleast desirable, for the state to insure workmen against this\r\nunavoidable risk.\r\n\r\nInsurance against unemployment has never been tried out in this\r\ncountry, but it is likely that we shall some day follow the example of\r\nthe leading European countries, and include this type of protection in\r\nour general program of social insurance.\r\n\r\n214. OBSTACLES TO LABOR LEGISLATION.--Labor legislation of the type\r\ndiscussed in this chapter is making rapid headway in the United\r\nStates. Nevertheless, it should be noted that in this field we are\r\nbehind the more advanced countries of western Europe. The chief\r\nexplanation of this relative backwardness is that the extension of\r\nlabor legislation in this country has met with considerable\r\nopposition. The reasons for this opposition may be summed up as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nFirst, the spirit of individualism is so strong in this country as\r\neffectively to check legislation which appears paternalistic. The weak\r\nposition of women and children in industry has somewhat lessened the\r\nforce of this argument in the case of laws designed to safeguard these\r\ntwo groups, but labor legislation in behalf of men is still regarded\r\nsuspiciously in many quarters.\r\n\r\nSecond, it is difficult to secure uniform laws among the several\r\nstates. Labor legislation in this country has been primarily a state\r\nconcern, but the attitude of the various states toward social\r\ninsurance, the minimum wage, and other types of labor legislation, has\r\nbeen so divergent that the resulting laws have often been conflicting.\r\nIn many cases states fear to enact laws which they believe will hamper\r\nlocal employers and encourage the migration of capital to states which\r\nare more lenient in this regard.\r\n\r\nThird, an important obstacle to labor legislation in the United States\r\nhas been the difficulty of enacting laws which the courts will not\r\ndeclare unconstitutional. The constitutional provision [Footnote: See\r\nthe fifth amendment to the Federal Constitution, Appendix.] that no\r\none shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due\r\nprocess of law has often been interpreted by the courts in such a way\r\nas to nullify laws designed to safeguard the interests of the working\r\nclasses. For example, a law restricting the employment of women might\r\nbe declared unconstitutional on the grounds that it interferes with\r\nthe \"liberty\" of women to work as many hours, and for as small a wage,\r\nas they choose.\r\n\r\nWithin the last decade, however, the obstacle of constitutionality\r\nappears to have declined in importance. Our Supreme Courts often\r\nreverse their own decisions, as well as negative the decisions of the\r\nlower courts, and it is therefore difficult to ascertain what is truly\r\nthe trend of judicial decision. Nevertheless, many authorities believe\r\nthat we are on the verge of an era in which the courts will weigh\r\nlabor legislation primarily in the light of its social benefit, and\r\nonly secondarily with respect to how it squares with the\r\ntechnicalities of the Constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS ON THE TEXT\r\n\r\n1.

RACIAL ELEMENTS IN OUR POPULATION.--The Federal census of 1920\r\ngave the population of continental United States as 105,710,620.\r\nApproximately nine tenths of this population is white, while about one\r\ntenth is negro. Those who are neither white nor negro, namely,\r\nAmerican Indians and Asiatics, together constitute less than one half\r\nof one per cent of the population.\r\n\r\nThe great majority of our people are either European immigrants, or\r\nthe descendants of European immigrants who came to this country within\r\nthe last century and a half. With reference to European immigration we\r\ndistinguish three groups: the foreign-born, the native-born children\r\nof the foreign-born, and natives. Natives include those whose\r\nancestors have been in this country two or more generations. On the\r\nbasis of this classification, about one seventh of our population is\r\nforeign-born while over one third is either foreign-born or the\r\nnative-born children of foreign-born parents.\r\n\r\nThe ease with which immigrants have adapted themselves to American\r\nlife prevents any accurate classification of nationalities in our\r\npopulation, but probably Great Britain and Ireland, Germany, Italy,\r\nRussia, (including Poland), and Austria-Hungary have, in the order\r\nnamed, contributed the largest numbers.\r\n\r\n216. THE \"OLD\" IMMIGRATION.--European immigration to the United States\r\nmay be divided into two groups, the \"old\" and the \"new.\" The \"old\"\r\nimmigration extended from the beginning of our national history to\r\nabout the year 1880, and was derived chiefly from Great Britain and\r\nIreland, Germany, and the Scandinavian countries. Between 1820 (the\r\nfirst year for which we have accurate records) and 1880, about nine\r\ntenths of our immigrants came from these countries.\r\n\r\nThe striking features of the \"old\" immigration should be noted. In\r\ncomparison with present-day immigration, it was relatively small in\r\nvolume. In view of the abundance here of free land, and our consequent\r\nneed for pioneers, the small volume of immigration prevented the rise\r\nof any serious problem. Moreover, the \"old\" immigration was largely\r\nmade up of individuals who were similar to the original American\r\ncolonists in political ideals, social training, and economic\r\nbackground. The \"old\" immigration therefore merged with the native\r\nstock fairly easily and rapidly.\r\n\r\n217. THE \"OLD\" GIVES WAY TO THE \"NEW\" IMMIGRATION.--In the period\r\ncentering about the year 1880 there was a distinct shift in the\r\nimmigration movement. Whereas before 1880 most of our immigrants had\r\nbeen Anglo-Saxons and Teutons from northern Europe, after 1880 the\r\nmajority of our immigrants were members of the Mediterranean and\r\nSlavic races from southern and southeastern Europe. Before 1880 about\r\nnine tenths of the aliens coming to our shores were from northern\r\nEurope and only one tenth were from southern and southeastern Europe.\r\nIn the period since 1880, less than one fourth of our immigrants have\r\ncome from northern Europe, while more than three fourths have been\r\nderived from southern and southeastern Europe. The bulk of this new\r\nimmigration has come from Russia, Poland, Austria-Hungary, Greece,\r\nTurkey, Italy, and the Balkan countries.\r\n\r\n218. INCREASING VOLUME OF IMMIGRATION.--Since it is in connection with\r\nthe \"new\" immigration that the modern immigration problem arises, it\r\nwill be profitable to inquire more fully into the character of the\r\nmovement after about 1880.\r\n\r\nNot only has the character of immigration changed since the eighties,\r\nbut the volume of immigration has steadily increased. Of approximately\r\n35,000,000 immigrants who have come to our shores since 1800, more\r\nthan half have come within the last thirty-five years. The peak of\r\nimmigration was reached in the decade preceding the World War, when as\r\nmany as a million and a quarter of immigrants landed in this country\r\nin a single year. This heavy flow was interrupted by the World War,\r\nbut after the signing of the armistice in the fall of 1918, a heavy\r\nimmigration again set in. [Footnote: Various classes of immigrants\r\nare excluded from the United States by the immigration laws summarized\r\nin section 223 of this chapter. In addition to these laws, which may\r\nbe said to constitute the basis of our permanent immigration policy,\r\nPresident Harding signed, in May, 1921, a bill relative to the\r\ntemporary exclusion of aliens who would ordinarily be admissible. This\r\ntemporary exclusion act provided that between July 1, 1921, and June\r\n30, 1922, the number of immigrants entering the United States from any\r\nother country might not exceed three per cent of the former immigrants\r\nfrom that country who were within the bounds of the United States at\r\nthe time of the last census.]\r\n\r\n219. DISTRIBUTION OF THE \"NEW\" IMMIGRATION.--One of the most\r\nsignificant facts in connection with the immigration problem is that\r\nour immigrant population is unequally distributed. About two thirds of\r\nthe immigrants in this country are in the North Atlantic division;\r\nabout a quarter of them are located in the North Central division;\r\nwhile less than one tenth are located in the western and southern\r\nsections of the country combined. Three fourths of our foreign-born\r\nlive in the cities of the North Atlantic and North Central divisions.\r\nForty per cent of the present population of New York City is foreign\r\nborn, while in Boston and Chicago more than a third of the population\r\nis foreign born. In the smaller manufacturing cities of the North\r\nAtlantic division it often happens that from half to four fifths of\r\nthe population is foreign born.\r\n\r\n220. ECONOMIC EFFECTS OF IMMIGRATION.--In the earlier part of our\r\nnational history free land was abundant and immigration relatively\r\nsmall in volume; after the eighties free land disappeared and\r\nimmigration increased rapidly. It was toward the end of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, therefore, that the economic aspect of the immigration\r\nproblem became acute. In the last decades of that century\r\nmanufacturing developed rapidly, and American cities became important\r\ncenters of population. Large numbers of immigrants were attracted by\r\nthe opportunities for employment in urban centers. An addition to this\r\nfactor, immigrants continued to concentrate in the cities, partly\r\nbecause of the spirit of clannishness, partly because of the\r\ndisappearance of free land, and partly because the development of\r\nagricultural machinery reduced the demand for agricultural laborers.\r\nStill another influence was the fact that the unfamiliar American farm\r\nwas less attractive to the southern European immigrant than was the\r\nopportunity of performing unskilled labor in the city. To-day four\r\nfifths of our immigrants are unskilled laborers who are employed\r\nchiefly in mining, construction work, transportation, and domestic\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nFrom the economic standpoint, the chief objection to unrestricted\r\nimmigration is that it prevents the wages of American workmen from\r\nrising as rapidly as would otherwise be the case. The newly arrived\r\nimmigrant usually has a lower standard of living than has the native\r\nAmerican; that is to say, the immigrant is content with less in the\r\nway of food, clothing, house room and education than is the native.\r\nWhen newly arrived immigrants come into competition with native\r\nworkmen, the immigrant generally offers to work for a lower wage than\r\nthe native. But though relatively low, this wage is so much higher\r\nthan the newly arrived immigrant has been used to, that he feels\r\njustified in marrying early and rearing a large family. This adds to\r\nthe supply of unskilled labor.\r\n\r\nIn order to compete with the recent immigrant, the native must accept\r\nrelatively low wages. In order to get along on these relatively low\r\nwages, the native must either lower his standard of living or postpone\r\nmarriage. Sometimes he has lowered his standard of living; sometimes\r\nhe has preferred to retain his relatively high standard of living, and\r\nto get along on the decreased wage either by postponing marriage, or\r\nby permanently abandoning his plans for a normal family life. It is\r\ncontended, therefore, that an oversupply of unskilled immigrant labor\r\nin this country has had at least two injurious results. First, it has\r\nkept the standard of living of American workmen from rising as rapidly\r\nas would otherwise have been possible. Second, it has caused the birth\r\nrate to decline among the native groups.\r\n\r\n221. SOCIAL EFFECTS OF IMMIGRATION.--The tendency of immigrants to\r\nconcentrate in American cities gives rise to a number of serious\r\nsocial problems. Urban congestion is unqualifiedly bad. It is\r\ndifficult or impossible for immigrants living in crowded quarters to\r\nmaintain proper health standards. Nor does overcrowding conduce to\r\nhealthy morals. The foreign born do not show an unusual tendency\r\ntoward crime, which is remarkable when we consider the immigrant's\r\nignorance of our laws, as well as the ease with which unscrupulous\r\npersons exploit him. On the other hand, the children of the foreign\r\nborn often show a strong tendency toward crime and vice, a fact which\r\nis attributed to the bad social conditions surrounding their homes.\r\nThe percentage of dependency among immigrants is rather high. This is\r\nnot surprising, however, for many immigrants must go through an\r\nadjustment period in which lack of financial reserves is likely to\r\nforce them to call upon charitable agencies for temporary aid.\r\n\r\n222. DIFFICULTY OF ASSIMILATING THE \"NEW\" IMMIGRATION.--Those who made\r\nup the \"old\" immigration assimilated rapidly: they were relatively\r\nlike the native stock in manners and customs, the volume of\r\nimmigration was relatively small, and the newcomers spread out into\r\nfrontier communities where habitual contact with natives was\r\nunavoidable.\r\n\r\nThose who make up the \"new\" immigration have assimilated less rapidly:\r\nthey are relatively unlike the native stock in language, race, and\r\ncustoms; the volume of immigration is very great; and rather than\r\nbeing uniformly distributed, the \"new\" immigrants tend to concentrate\r\nin cities where they are often little subject to contact with natives.\r\nMembers of foreign \"colonies\" not only tend to remain ignorant of\r\nAmerican life, but unfamiliarity with self-government encourages their\r\nexploitation by political \"bosses.\" It is admitted by the most careful\r\nstudents that the lack of proper civic ideals among unassimilated\r\nforeigners in American cities is a large element in the corruption of\r\nour municipal governments.\r\n\r\n223. RESTRICTIVE LEGISLATION.--Exclusive control of immigration is\r\nvested in the Federal government. During the Civil War Congress\r\nactually encouraged immigration, but since 1882 our policy has been\r\none of restriction. In the latter year the first general immigration\r\nact was passed, though considerable legislation on the subject was\r\nalready on the statute books. Supplementary laws were enacted from\r\ntime to time, the most important piece of legislation since 1900 being\r\nthe Immigration Act of 1917. A brief summary of this and previous acts\r\nwill serve to show the nature and extent of Federal control over\r\nimmigration.\r\n\r\nThe chief aim of our immigration laws has been so to restrict\r\nimmigration as to protect us against undesirable persons. In the\r\ninterest of health, persons afflicted with contagious diseases, such\r\nas tuberculosis, and trachoma,--a virulent eye disease,--are excluded.\r\nCertain persons whose character is clearly immoral are excluded.\r\nPolygamists are excluded. The Act of 1917 excludes anarchists, and\r\nlikewise bars from our shores all criminals, except those who have\r\ncommitted political offenses not recognized by the United States. In\r\norder to reduce unnecessary tax burdens, as well as to safeguard\r\ncommunity health, we also exclude insane persons, idiots, epileptics,\r\nbeggars, and other persons likely to become public charges. Contract\r\nlaborers are specifically excluded, the Act of 1917 using the term\r\n\"contract labor\" to include anyone \"induced, assisted, encouraged, or\r\nsolicited\" to come to this country \"by any kind of promise or\r\nagreement, express or implied, true or false, to find employment.\"\r\nPersons over sixteen years of age are excluded from the United States\r\nif they cannot read English or some other language. [Footnote: Certain\r\nnear relatives of admissible aliens, purely political offenders, and\r\npersons seeking refuge from religious persecution, are exempted from\r\nthis literacy test, however.]\r\n\r\nThe bars against Asiatics call for a special word.\r\n\r\n224. ASIATIC IMMIGRATION.--By Asiatic immigration is here meant\r\nChinese and Japanese immigration, immigrants from other parts of Asia\r\nbeing relatively unimportant.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of gold in California in 1849 caused a large number of\r\nChinese coolies to migrate to this country. This immigration grew\r\nsteadily until 1882, in which year the entrance of Chinese laborers\r\ninto the United States was forbidden. Our exclusion policy has been\r\nrepeatedly reaffirmed, as the result of which there are to-day fewer\r\nthan 70,000 Chinese in this country. The majority of these are found\r\non the Pacific Coast, engaged as small tradesmen, truck farmers, or\r\npersonal servants.\r\n\r\nJapanese immigration to this country did not become noticeable until\r\nabout 1900. After that date, however, the volume of Japanese\r\nimmigration so alarmed the Pacific Coast states that a Japanese\r\nexclusion policy was formulated as early as 1907. At present the only\r\nclasses of Japanese that are allowed to reside in this country\r\npermanently are \"former residents,\" \"parents, wives or children of\r\nresidents,\" or \"settled agriculturists,\" the latter being Japanese\r\nalready in possession of land here. There are at present fewer than\r\n120,000 Japanese in this country. Most of them are found on the\r\nPacific Coast, engaged in occupations similar to those of the Chinese\r\nin the same area. [Footnote: Chinese and Japanese students desiring to\r\nstudy in this country are allowed to enter the United States by\r\nspecial arrangement.]\r\n\r\nThose most familiar with the situation are practically unanimous in\r\ndeclaring for the continued exclusion of Chinese and Japanese\r\nimmigrants. In the case of both races, the standard of living is so\r\nmuch lower than that of native Americans that open competition between\r\nthe newly arrived Asiatic and the native American would result in the\r\nlatter being driven from the labor market. The most important social\r\nreason for the exclusion of these two races is that the differences of\r\nrace and religion existing between Asiatics and native Americans\r\nrender assimilation of the Chinese and Japanese extremely difficult,\r\nif not impossible.\r\n\r\n225. THE FUTURE OF IMMIGRATION.--A half century ago the belief was\r\ncurrent that an immigration policy was unnecessary, since the sources\r\nof immigration would eventually dry up. The sources of the \"old\"\r\nimmigration have dried up somewhat, but new sources have been opened\r\nup in southern and southeastern Europe. Immigration is a pressing\r\nsocial problem, and it is likely that it will be even more pressing in\r\nthe future. The American frontier has disappeared and our boundaries\r\nare fixed. Urbanization is proceeding at a rapid rate, industry is\r\nbecoming more complex, public opinion is more insistent that such\r\nsocial problems as immigration shall be solved.\r\n\r\n226. WHAT SHALL BE OUR ATTITUDE TOWARD IMMIGRATION?--There is no good\r\nreason why immigration should be absolutely prohibited. On the other\r\nhand, the most public-spirited students of the question believe that\r\nthe careful restriction of immigration is imperative. Clearly, it is\r\nour duty to accept only such immigrants as show promise of becoming\r\ncapable and efficient American citizens. It is also clearly our duty\r\nto accept even this type of immigrant only in such numbers as we can\r\nconveniently assimilate. We must not be selfish with America, but we\r\nshould not be misled by the statement that anyone in Europe has a\r\n\"right\" to make his home in this country. Those who come to this\r\ncountry are personally benefited, no doubt, but unrestricted\r\nimmigration may lower the tone of American life and permanently injure\r\nour social and political institutions. America is for the present\r\ngeneration, but is also for posterity. The millions of unborn have as\r\nmuch right to be considered as have the millions now clamoring at our\r\ngates. For this reason, the \"right\" of an individual to migrate to\r\nAmerica must be interpreted in the light of what he will mean to the\r\nfuture of this country.\r\n\r\n227. HELPING THE IMMIGRANT IN HIS NEW HOME.--The readjustment,\r\nassimilation, or \"Americanization\" of the immigrant is a problem of\r\nvital importance. The term \"Americanization\" is variously interpreted,\r\nand must be used with care. Americanization ought not to force the\r\nimmigrant to give up his native tongue, or his old-country customs. It\r\nought to be a mutually helpful process, whereby native Americans would\r\nhelp the immigrant in adjusting himself to his new environment, while,\r\nin turn, the immigrant would be permitted and encouraged to make his\r\nown contribution to American life. Since the immigrant has little or\r\nno opportunity to contribute to American life until he has become\r\nadjusted to his new home, it follows that the most fundamental part of\r\nan Americanization program is one of helping the immigrant solve his\r\nproblems.\r\n\r\nIn carrying out this part of the Americanization program it is\r\nessential that the newly arrived alien be protected against\r\nunscrupulous persons who seek to exploit him. Adequate laws ought to\r\nbe supplemented by the work of immigrant aid societies and other\r\nprivate organizations whose duty it would be to protect immigrants\r\nagainst dishonest boarding houses, swindlers, unreliable banks, and\r\nother forms of imposition. Friendly help of this type will do much\r\ntoward encouraging and inspiring the alien in his new life.\r\n\r\nImprovement in the immigrant's economic status is an important part of\r\nan Americanization program. Not only does the undue concentration of\r\nimmigrants in cities spell ill-health and a great temptation to crime\r\nand vice, but immigrant laborers sometimes secure lower wages in\r\ncities than they would receive in the more sparsely settled parts of\r\nthe country. Of considerable interest, therefore, is the recent\r\ndevelopment of plans for redistributing immigrants into the rural and\r\nsparsely populated districts. [Footnote: The movement to transfer\r\nimmigrants to the rural districts is not unqualifiedly good; indeed,\r\nit may do more harm than good. For the dangers of this movement, see\r\nChapter XXV.] Since 1907 the Division of Information in the Bureau of\r\nLabor Statistics has done valuable work in finding employment for\r\nimmigrants in rural districts. Much remains to be done, however.\r\n\r\nThe school, of course, is an important agent of Americanization.\r\nWhether or not the immigrant retains his old-country language, he\r\nought to learn to speak, read and write English. The school is\r\nlikewise an important means of instructing the newcomers and their\r\nchildren in the essentials of American history and government. Where\r\nthe school is being used as a real community center, the institution\r\nbecomes truly a method of introducing the foreign-born to the everyday\r\nactivities of American life. The increasing emphasis upon the racial\r\ntraits of different immigrant groups, with a view to encouraging\r\nunique contributions to the culture of the community, deserves special\r\nnotice.\r\n\r\nAmericanization measures of the type touched upon in this section help\r\nto build the nation on a sound foundation of friendly and intelligent\r\nco÷peration.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS ON THE TEXT\r\n\r\n1.

THE NATURE OF CRIME.--A crime is an act which is punishable by\r\nlaw because it is considered injurious to the community. If the\r\naverage man were a hermit, living entirely alone, his actions would\r\naffect only himself, and he would be subjected to little or no control\r\nby any community. But the average man is a member of a highly\r\ncivilized community, and what he does, or what he fails to do, often\r\nprofoundly affects other individuals. Members of the community\r\ntherefore agree upon standards of conduct, to which individuals must\r\nconform. [Footnote: Where democracy does not exist, or is only\r\npartially developed, laws may be imposed upon the group from without.\r\nIn such a country as the United States, however, legal standards of\r\nconduct are preeminently the result of mutual agreements, freely\r\nentered into.] It is the failure to conform to these standards which\r\nconstitutes a crime, and which entails punishment by law.\r\n\r\nWhat constitutes a crime depends, of course, upon the level of\r\ncivilization reached by a community, and upon the interpretation which\r\nit places upon right conduct. A deed considered heroic in one age may\r\nbe considered a crime in a later century. In the days of chivalry, for\r\nexample, it was sometimes considered heroic to rob or even kill wicked\r\nnobles in order to distribute their wealth to the poor. At the present\r\ntime, of course, such acts would constitute a crime.\r\n\r\n229. THE CAUSES OF CRIME.--The causes of crime are so various and so\r\ncomplex that their accurate classification is impossible. But some\r\nlight may be thrown upon the subject if we think of crime as\r\ninfluenced by economic, social, personal, and political factors.\r\n\r\nLooking at crime from an economic point of view, it is obvious that\r\npoverty often accompanies crime. In many cases, it is claimed, such\r\ncrimes as larceny, forgery, and robbery are directly traceable to\r\npoverty. Similarly, it is said that unemployment and industrial\r\naccidents may incite individuals to crime. Many authorities claim,\r\nhowever, that while bad economic conditions accompany and often\r\nencourage crime, such conditions alone are not a direct cause of\r\ncrime. According to this latter view, poverty, for example, will not\r\ncause a person to commit a crime unless he is feeble-minded, depraved\r\nin morals, or otherwise defective in character.\r\n\r\nWhile there is a good deal of dispute as to whether or not poverty is\r\na direct cause of crime, it is quite generally agreed that a bad\r\neconomic situation gives rise to social conditions which can be\r\ndefinitely connected with criminality. The strain and artificiality of\r\nurban life, together with the difficulty of obtaining inexpensive and\r\nwholesome recreation in the poorer sections of large cities, has a\r\nclose connection with crime. The overcrowding so common in tenement\r\ndistricts renders difficult or impossible the maintenance of high\r\nmoral standards. Where mother or children are habitually employed\r\noutside the home, the young are often denied proper home training.\r\nDivorce, desertion, or the death of the bread-winner may break up the\r\nfamily and indirectly give rise to illiteracy, vice, and crime.\r\n\r\nOften indistinguishable from the social causes are the personal causes\r\nof crime. Where alcoholism or vicious habits are given as the cause of\r\ncrime, it may be impossible to say whether social or personal defect\r\nis primarily to blame. Illiteracy, superficially a _personal_ cause of\r\ncrime, may often be traced to a bad _social_ environment. Thus an\r\nindividual may be illiterate because his parents were unwilling or\r\nunable to send him to school, or because evil companions discouraged\r\nhim from study. Such personal causes as mental defect are extremely\r\nimportant, indeed, many students maintain that bad economic and social\r\nconditions are negligible causes of crime, unless found in connection\r\nwith low mentality and a depraved moral sense.\r\n\r\nLast among the causes of crime we may consider defects in government.\r\nThe laws of a community may be so numerous, or so unwisely worded,\r\nthat even responsible individuals violate them without understanding\r\nthe nature of their act. After children have committed petty offenses\r\nthrough carelessness or a sense of mischief, the harshness of the\r\npolice may so embitter or antagonize the culprits that their criminal\r\ntendencies are intensified. An important cause of crime is the custom,\r\nstill common in many states, of imprisoning young and first offenders\r\nin county jails, where they are allowed to mingle with, and learn\r\nabout crime from, hardened and depraved criminals.\r\n\r\n230. THE REMEDIES FOR CRIME.--The causes of crime suggest the nature\r\nof its remedies. Wherever bad economic conditions either directly or\r\nindirectly encourage crime, the remedy is, of course, the relief or\r\nabolition of poverty. This problem has already been discussed.\r\n\r\nSince bad social conditions are often the result of poverty, any\r\nmeasures which will lessen poverty will also remove many of the so-\r\ncalled social causes of crime. Education, the safeguarding of the\r\nhome, constructive charity, and similar measures will also help to\r\nremove the social causes of crime. These questions are discussed\r\nelsewhere in this text, and need not be gone into here.\r\n\r\nThe improvement of economic and social conditions will ultimately help\r\nto eliminate bad heredity, vice, and other of the personal causes of\r\ncrime.\r\n\r\nWith the understanding, then, that the eradication of the economic,\r\nsocial and personal causes of crime is discussed elsewhere, we may\r\nhere confine ourselves to the question of preventing crime by\r\nremedying the defects of government.\r\n\r\n231. JUSTICE AS AN IDEAL.--Justice has constituted one of the basic\r\nideals of the English-speaking peoples since the days of Magna Charta.\r\n\"To no one will we sell, and to no one will we refuse or delay, right\r\nor justice,\" declared that great document. This conception was later\r\nglorified into an ideal which, after having persisted for four\r\ncenturies in England, was brought to the New World by the English\r\ncolonists. The first ten amendments to the Federal Constitution and\r\nthe Bill of Rights contained in the constitutions of the several\r\nstates have been called by Lord Bryce \"the legitimate children of\r\nMagna Charta.\" Since the beginning of our history, thus, a great\r\ncornerstone of American democracy has been the concept of sound and\r\nequitable law, impartially and effectively administered.\r\n\r\n232. THE DENIAL OF JUSTICE.--Within the last decade we have come to\r\nrealize that in many of the criminal courts of this country justice is\r\nan ideal rather than a fact. \"The administration of criminal law in\r\nall the states of this Union,\" said Chief Justice Taft a few years\r\nago, \"is a disgrace to civilization.\"\r\n\r\nOur criminal law is administered unjustly in two ways.\r\n\r\nFirst, it sometimes allows the rich, the cunning, and the powerful\r\noffenders to escape the penalty for their crimes. In many states the\r\ncourt dockets are so crowded that influential offenders are not\r\nconvicted for years, if at all. Rich prisoners may be released on\r\nbail, and consideration of their case so delayed that the evidence\r\ndisappears. Public interest is diverted to new cases, and eventually\r\nthe case may be quietly dismissed. Mr. Taft points out that we lead\r\nthe world in the number of serious crimes which go unpunished. Appeals\r\nare allowed almost as a matter of course, so that in many serious\r\ncriminal trials the original verdict is only the beginning of the\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nSecond, the law which often allows the powerful and crafty to avoid\r\npunishment may operate to deny justice to the poor. Ignorant prisoners\r\nare in many cases so bewildered by cumbersome and technical court\r\nprocedure that they allow their cases to be disposed of without\r\nadequate protection of their rights. Often they have no one to advise\r\nthem as to their constitutional rights and privileges. If they are not\r\nonly ignorant but poor, they find themselves unable to employ proper\r\ncounsel. The Constitution indeed recognizes the right of an accused\r\nperson to have counsel, but in many states if a man is too poor or too\r\nignorant to secure a lawyer, he is obliged to stand trial without\r\nanyone to represent or advise him. In some states, the court appoints\r\na lawyer to represent such defendants. Sometimes the assigned counsel\r\nis dishonest, and too often his primary object is to get a fee rather\r\nthan to secure justice for his client. Generally the counsel so\r\nappointed is inexperienced, and consequently no match for an able and\r\nexperienced prosecuting attorney, whose reputation may depend upon the\r\nnumber of convictions that he secures.\r\n\r\n233. THE REFORM OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE.--The reform of criminal\r\nprocedure is assuming great importance as a problem of American\r\ndemocracy. In many states there is a demand for a wider and more\r\nenergetic use of the Bertillon and finger print systems for the\r\nidentification of criminals. Because of the fact that in our large\r\ncities a heavy percentage of crimes are committed without the\r\nsubsequent arrest of the culprit, there is a growing demand for the\r\nimprovement of our police systems. Our criminal law needs to be\r\nsimplified, so that justice may not be delayed by technicalities, long\r\narguments on the admissibility of evidence, and the abuse of the right\r\nof appeal. Probably a good many of the delays and technicalities of\r\nlegal procedure could be avoided if at the trial the judge were to\r\nexercise a greater amount of control over the proceedings.\r\n\r\nThe reform of criminal procedure has a double aim. First, it aims to\r\nreorganize and perfect criminal procedure so that persons who have\r\ncommitted an offense will be apprehended and always made to pay the\r\npenalty for their crimes. Toward the achievement of this ideal we have\r\nas yet done very little. We are still woefully behind such a country\r\nas England, where justice is administered with relative rapidity and\r\nsureness. Second, the reform of criminal procedure aims to prevent the\r\nlaw from bearing with undue weight upon the poor and ignorant. Here we\r\nare making greater progress. Let us notice what is being done to\r\nguarantee justice to persons who are unable adequately to safeguard\r\ntheir own legal rights.\r\n\r\n234. THE LEGAL AID SOCIETY.--A valuable institution is the legal aid\r\nsociety, which originated in New York City in 1876, and which has\r\nsince spread to other parts of the country. Of the forty legal aid\r\nsocieties now in existence in this country, some of the better known\r\nare located in New York City, Los Angeles, Kansas City, Boston, and\r\nChicago. The legal aid society is generally a private organization,\r\ncreated and maintained by public-spirited citizens who believe that\r\nthe poor and ignorant ought to be given legal advice free of charge,\r\nor upon the payment of a nominal fee. These societies extend advice on\r\nboth civil and criminal matters. The legal aid society helps\r\nmaterially to secure justice by acquainting the individual with his\r\nlegal rights, and by acting as his counsel in court. Such\r\norganizations are especially valuable in safeguarding the rights and\r\nprivileges of immigrants in large cities. The total number of persons\r\nhelped annually by legal aid societies in the United States is over\r\n100,000.\r\n\r\n235. THE PUBLIC DEFENDER.--The Public Defender movement is an\r\noutgrowth of the feeling that it is unfair for the court to assign an\r\ninexperienced and sometimes unreliable lawyer to defend a penniless\r\nprisoner, while the case is prosecuted by a skilful district attorney.\r\nIn spite of the presumption that the prisoner is innocent until he is\r\nproved guilty, such practices as this have operated as though the\r\nprisoner were presumed to be guilty.\r\n\r\nIn 1912 Oklahoma attempted to remedy this evil by appointing a Public\r\nDefender whose duty it should be to aid in the defense of persons\r\nunable to employ counsel. The next year the city of Los Angeles\r\nappointed a Public Defender who, as a sworn public counsel of\r\nexperience and integrity, makes it his business to defend poor\r\nprisoners without charge. A few years later, Portland, Oregon, and\r\nOmaha, Nebraska, appointed similar officers. Since 1916 many other\r\ncities, and a few states, have provided for a Public Defender of some\r\nkind, although in many cases the provision is as yet inadequate. In\r\nall cities in which the plan has been given a trial, the Public\r\nDefender has been instrumental in securing justice for the poor, and\r\nin raising the moral tone of the criminal trial. By eliminating much\r\nunnecessary delay from the criminal trial, the Public Defender has\r\nalso helped to reduce court expenses.\r\n\r\n236. CHANGING IDEALS IN PENOLOGY.--In the early stages of society the\r\nspirit of revenge seems to have been a chief motive in the punishment\r\nof criminals, although the desire to prevent crime must also have been\r\na factor. With the progress of civilization revenge declined in\r\nimportance, and the punishment of the criminal seems to have been\r\nundertaken chiefly for the purpose of preventing future crimes. Long\r\nperiods of imprisonment, inhuman punishments, and the frequent use of\r\nthe death penalty were characteristic of this attitude toward crime.\r\nCuriously enough, punishments were imposed according to the\r\nseriousness of the crime committed, without regard to the character\r\nand needs of the criminal.\r\n\r\nOf recent years the theory of punishment has been still further\r\nmodified. In the first place, we have begun to doubt if punishment\r\nalways serves a useful purpose. Punishment does not always deter\r\ncriminals, and for this reason it is likely that the death penalty and\r\nother cruel and inhuman methods of punishment may be dispensed with,\r\nwithout a resultant increase in the amount of crime. In the second\r\nplace, punishment has taken on a new aim. More and more we are coming\r\nto believe that it should be imposed, not according to the seriousness\r\nof the crime committed, but according as the individual criminal needs\r\nto be punished in order to effect his reformation. This new attitude\r\nis based upon the assumption that the criminal is a person who is not\r\nadapted to the conditions of modern life, and that the chief aim of\r\nthe authorities should be so to reform him that he will become a\r\nuseful member of society. In case reform seems impossible, the\r\ncriminal should be segregated in an institution.\r\n\r\n237. INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT OF OFFENDERS.--The emphasis now placed\r\nupon reformation has made necessary a new point of view on the part of\r\nthe public. We are beginning to make use of a mass of data furnished\r\nby physiology, psychology, and sociology, and on the basis of these\r\ndata to subject prisoners to individualized treatment. Instead of\r\nherding all offenders into a single institution such as the county\r\njail or the penitentiary, we are beginning to inquire, first of all,\r\nwhether the prisoner might not be treated most effectively outside\r\nprison walls. For those offenders who seem to require institutional\r\ntreatment, we are developing a whole series of institutions, designed\r\nto care for special types of abnormality. Industrial and farm colonies\r\nfor petty offenders and occasional criminals, hospitals and colonies\r\nfor the mentally defective, industrial schools and reformatories for\r\ncertain types of juvenile offenders, and penitentiaries for hardened\r\noffenders, all these are included in the correctional system of the\r\nmore progressive states.\r\n\r\n238. SUBSTITUTES FOR IMPRISONMENT.--The belief is growing that young\r\noffenders, first offenders, and those committing petty crimes, may\r\noften be corrected without actual imprisonment. Increasingly common is\r\nthe probation system, the essence of which is to suspend the sentence\r\nof the court upon certain conditions. The offender is placed in charge\r\nof a court officer who will stand in the relation of friend and\r\nguardian to him, in order to supervise his conduct and to attempt his\r\nreformation. The success of the probation system depends largely upon\r\nthe care and judgment with which probation officers control their\r\ncharges.\r\n\r\nThe use of the fine deserves mention. Generally the sentence for a\r\npetty offense is a fine, with imprisonment as an alternative in case\r\nthe prisoner is unable to pay the fine. Realizing the corrupting\r\ninfluence of the jail sentence for first or slight offenders, court\r\nofficials in many cities are making the payment of the fine less\r\ndifficult. In Buffalo, Indianapolis, Chicago, and other cities it is\r\ncustomary in some cases to allow the payment of a fine in instalments.\r\nThis ultimately secures the fine; it has a disciplinary effect upon\r\nthe offender; and it keeps him out of jail.\r\n\r\n239. MENTAL DEFECTIVES.--Recent progress in medicine and psychology\r\nhas demonstrated that many criminals are mentally defective. Such\r\npersons are not fully responsible for their acts, and nothing is to be\r\ngained by committing them to prison. They need special treatment in\r\ninstitutions for the insane, the feeble-minded, and the otherwise\r\ndefective. In recognition of this fact, the criminal courts of our\r\nlarger cities now make extensive use of psychopathic experts. It is\r\nthe duty of these experts to determine the mental status of the\r\nprisoner, and, in case he is found to be mentally defective, to\r\nrecommend the type of treatment needed.\r\n\r\nThis is an admirable development, provided care is taken to prevent\r\nthe abuse of the insanity plea by influential criminals who, though\r\nnormal mentally, seek to evade responsibility for their deliberate\r\ncrimes.\r\n\r\n240. THE JUVENILE OFFENDER.--It has been proved that a large\r\npercentage of hardened criminals begin their careers by some careless\r\nor mischievous act for which they were severely or unwisely punished.\r\nFormerly, juvenile offenders were treated much as were adult\r\ncriminals; more recently we are coming to believe that children ought\r\nnot to be committed to penal institutions, but rather should be put on\r\nprobation, or sent to correctional institutions of a special type.\r\nWherever possible, institutional treatment of every kind ought to be\r\navoided, for the crimes of children are clearly in a different class\r\nfrom those of the adult. In New York City a few years ago, for\r\nexample, half the children brought into court were there because of\r\nthe lack of recreation facilities. Petty theft and malicious mischief\r\nare often traceable to bad home influences and the unnatural\r\nsurroundings of the city. These circumstances, coupled with the fact\r\nthat immature children are often unaware of the seriousness of their\r\nlawless acts, justify the special treatment of the juvenile offender.\r\n\r\n241. THE JUVENILE COURT.--The juvenile court has been created to meet\r\nthe special needs of the youthful offender. An early institution of\r\nthis kind was established in Chicago in 1889. Shortly afterward Denver\r\nestablished a juvenile court, and since then many other cities have\r\ntaken up the idea. In some states county judges are authorized to\r\nsuspend the ordinary rules of procedure where the defendant is under\r\neighteen years of age.\r\n\r\nA typical juvenile court provides separate judges and separate\r\nhearings for youthful prisoners. It avoids publicity, investigates the\r\nhome life of the youthful offender, and attempts by kindly treatment\r\nto guide him back into a wholesome, honest life. In some cases\r\ndelinquent children are sent back to school, in other cases they are\r\nplaced on probation, in still other cases special institutional\r\ntreatment is provided. Every effort is made to keep juvenile offenders\r\nfrom associating with habitual criminals. The aim of the court is not\r\nto punish the offender for a particular offense, but to weigh all the\r\ncircumstances which have influenced his life, and to correct his wrong\r\ntendencies. Work of this type is preventive in the fullest sense of\r\nthe word.\r\n\r\n242. THE INDETERMINATE SENTENCE.--The realization that punishment\r\nought to fit the criminal rather than the crime has led to the\r\nindeterminate sentence. Though not yet widely applied, this reform is\r\nattracting more and more attention. A logical application of the\r\nindeterminate sentence would require prisoners to be committed to\r\nprison, not for a specific term, but for an indefinite period. The\r\nactual length of the prison term would depend upon the prison record\r\nof the individual, and upon the promise that he showed of becoming a\r\nuseful and normal citizen if released. According to this plan,\r\noccasional criminals, and persons enticed or forced into wrong-doing,\r\nwould be entitled to release (regardless of the character of the\r\ncrime) as soon as it became apparent that they would not repeat the\r\noffense. Hardened criminals, on the other hand, might remain in prison\r\npermanently, even though committed for a trifling offense. Certainly\r\nwe ought not to continue to commit and to re-commit hardened criminals\r\nfor short terms, when their past conduct proves that they have neither\r\nthe intention nor the ability to make proper use of their freedom.\r\n\r\n243. THE FUNCTION OF THE MODERN PRISON.--In addition to the principle\r\nof the indeterminate sentence, modern penology has approved a whole\r\nseries of supplementary measures. The ideal prison of to-day is not a\r\ngloomy dungeon, but a great plant which attempts to turn criminals\r\ninto useful citizens through the use of the school, the chapel, the\r\nworkshop, the gymnasium, the library, and even the theatre.\r\nDiscipline, the fundamental weakness of offenders against the law, is\r\na cornerstone of prison life. More and more prisons are adopting the\r\nmerit system, according to which prisoners are graded and promoted to\r\nadditional privileges on the basis of behavior. In many prisons these\r\nprivileges may include an \"honor system\" and \"inmate self-government.\"\r\nThe prison attempts to supply the deficiencies in the convict's early\r\ntraining. Prisoners are taught to take care of their bodies. They are\r\ntaught useful trades, according to their abilities. If illiterate they\r\nmay go to the prison school. Religious exercises and moral instruction\r\nare employed to develop a sense of moral values.\r\n\r\nWhen consistent good behavior and earnest endeavor in prison duties\r\nindicate that the prisoner is entitled to another chance in the\r\noutside world, he may be paroled, that is to say, he may be released\r\non certain conditions. Generally prisoners are not paroled until some\r\nperson is found who will guarantee them employment. In many states the\r\nwork of the parole board is ably supplemented by unofficial prisoners'\r\naid societies which help the released man to readjust himself to a\r\nfree life. After a certain period of satisfactory conduct on parole\r\nthe prisoner is entitled to a full and unconditional discharge. The\r\nwhole aim of the parole system is to supervise the actions of the\r\nprisoner, without adding to his irritation or humiliation, but with\r\nsufficient strictness to guard him against temptation and to replace\r\nhim in prison if he proves unworthy of the trust bestowed upon him.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS ON THE TEXT\r\n\r\n1.

ORIGIN OF THE AMERICAN NEGRO.--Early in the seventeenth century\r\nthe scarcity of labor in the American colonies led to the introduction\r\nof African Negroes as slaves. In response to the demand for slave\r\nlabor on the southern plantations, the importation of Negroes\r\nincreased steadily during the next century. The slave trade was\r\nnominally abolished in 1808, but Negroes continued to be brought in\r\nuntil the Civil War period. In September, 1862, President Lincoln\r\nproclaimed abolished both the slave trade and the institution of\r\nslavery in the United States. The legality of this act was\r\nsubstantiated in 1865 by the Thirteenth Amendment to the Federal\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\n245. RISE OF THE NEGRO PROBLEM.--The Emancipation Proclamation,\r\nfollowed by the Thirteenth Amendment, conferred freedom upon four\r\nmillion slaves. In 1868 the Fourteenth Amendment made the freed\r\nNegroes citizens of the United States, and in 1870 the Fifteenth\r\nAmendment enfranchised them. Largely as the result of these measures,\r\nthe problem of the slave developed into the present Negro problem. The\r\nracial differences between the white and the Negro, as well as the\r\ndemoralizing effects of slavery, promised to render difficult the\r\nadjustment of the Negro to American life. The situation was made more\r\nserious by the suddenness of emancipation, and by the fact that the\r\nvote was extended the Negroes before most of them were ready for it.\r\nThe economic, social, and political upheaval effected in the South by\r\nthe war, together with the bitterness with which many southern white\r\nmen regarded the newly freed Negroes, also contributed to the\r\ndifficulty of the situation. Lastly, the Negro became a problem\r\nbecause of the lack of a national program in his behalf.\r\n\r\n246. NUMBERS AND DISTRIBUTION.--In 1920 the Federal census gave\r\n10,463,131 as the Negro population of the United States. According to\r\nthese figures the Negro constitutes slightly less than one tenth of\r\nour total population. Eighty-five per cent of the Negroes live in the\r\nSouth. In Mississippi and South Carolina the Negro exceeds the white\r\npopulation, while in several other southern states the Negro\r\nconstitutes from one fourth to one half of the total population.\r\n\r\nAbout three fourths of our Negroes live in the rural districts. There\r\nis, however, an important migratory movement which operates to\r\ndecrease this percentage. There is a growing tendency for southern\r\nNegroes to leave the rural districts and to move cityward. Chiefly\r\nbecause of the economic attractions of urban life, many rural Negroes\r\nare moving toward the southern city; in search of social equality as\r\nwell as greater economic opportunities, many southern Negroes are\r\nmigrating to the cities of the North.\r\n\r\n247. ADAPTABILITY OF THE NEGRO.--From one important angle,\r\ncivilization is the process of getting along with one's environment,\r\npartly by changing that environment, and partly by adapting one's self\r\nto external conditions. An important characteristic of the Negro, not\r\nusually taken into account, is his adaptability. Ours is predominantly\r\na white man's civilization, and we are accustomed to think of the\r\nNegro as an individual who finds it more or less difficult to fit into\r\nour way of living. And yet one reason for believing that the Negro has\r\na capacity for modern civilization is that he has survived until the\r\npresent time. Compare the Negro in this regard with the American\r\nIndian, who, despite his many noble traits, has fared poorly under the\r\nwhite man's civilization. The Indians of Cuba, for example, were so\r\nproud and unbending that they died out under the slavery which the\r\nearly Spanish imposed upon them; the Negro, because of his\r\nteachableness and his passive strength, not only survived slavery, but\r\nhas weathered freedom under very disadvantageous circumstances.\r\n\r\n248. PROGRESS SINCE THE CIVIL WAR.--The Negro has made considerable\r\nprogress since the Civil War. Many Negroes have become independent\r\nfarmers and artisans, owning a considerable amount of property.\r\nDespite the backwardness of Negro schools, great progress has been\r\nmade in the matter of decreasing Negro illiteracy. Whereas at the\r\nclose of the Civil War some ninety per cent of the Negroes were\r\nilliterate, less than a third of our present Negro population is\r\nilliterate. In art, literature and science the Negro has already made\r\na tolerable showing. Altogether it is likely that an able and\r\nconstructive leadership is being developed among the Negroes.\r\n\r\n249. PRESENT ECONOMIC CONDITION.--In spite of the substantial progress\r\nmade since the Civil War, however, the present economic condition of\r\nthe Negro is unsatisfactory. The great majority of Negroes are\r\nunskilled laborers of a shiftless disposition. Because he is\r\nfrequently neither a dependable nor an efficient worker, the average\r\nNegro tends to receive low wages. The Negro is not skilled in\r\nmanufacturing or mechanical lines, and he is kept out of the higher\r\ntrades and professions by reason of illiteracy and social barriers.\r\nVery often the southern Negro is a tenant farmer, carelessly tilling a\r\nsmall plot of land and mortgaging his crop in order to secure the bare\r\nnecessities of life. Large families, inadequately supported, and\r\nreared under insanitary living conditions, are characteristic of the\r\nsouthern Negro. The failure to save money, and the inability to\r\nprotect themselves against exploitation by unscrupulous white men, are\r\ncharacteristic weaknesses of many Negroes.\r\n\r\n250. PRESENT SOCIAL CONDITION.--Though decreasing steadily, Negro\r\nilliteracy is still high. This is a serious evil. Not only does\r\nilliteracy bar the Negro from the education and training of which he\r\nis in such great need, but it allows unscrupulous persons to swindle\r\nand exploit him. The Negro furnishes an abnormally large proportion of\r\nour prison population. Whether or not this is partly the result of\r\nracial characteristics, it is certain that the bad economic and social\r\nconditions surrounding Negro life lead to a high degree of\r\ncriminality. In justice to the Negro it should be noted that in many\r\ncommunities he is apprehended and convicted more often than is the\r\nwhite culprit. Acts which would go unpunished or even unnoticed if\r\ncommitted by white men often arouse the community and lead to severe\r\npunishment when committed by Negroes. Statistics on Negro crime are\r\nalso influenced by the fact that the poverty of the Negro often causes\r\nhim to go to jail while the white offender escapes with a fine.\r\n\r\nA serious evil is race mixture between Negroes and whites. This has\r\ngone on since colonial times, until at the present time probably more\r\nthan half of the Negroes in the United States have some degree of\r\nwhite blood. Such mixtures, while probably not disastrous from the\r\nstandpoint of biology, have unfortunate consequences socially.\r\nGenerally the mulatto offspring are forced to remain members of the\r\nNegro group, where they are subjected to social surroundings which too\r\noften encourage disease, vice, and degeneracy. The majority of the\r\nstates now have laws forbidding marriage between Negroes and whites.\r\nBoth white and Negro leaders agree that race mixture ought to be\r\nstopped.\r\n\r\n251. PRESENT POLITICAL CONDITION.--The Fifteenth Amendment declared\r\nthat \"the right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be\r\ndenied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of\r\nrace, color, or previous condition of servitude.\" Yet in many southern\r\nstates the Negro is barred from the polls. In many northern cities\r\nwhere the Negro is allowed the ballot, his ignorance and\r\nirresponsibility make him the prey of political \"bosses\" who control\r\nhis vote. The question of Negro suffrage will be treated later;\r\n[Footnote: See Chapter XXXIII.] here we may content ourselves with\r\nnoting that the Negro's right to vote is often restricted. In the\r\nSouth, at least, it is also true that the Negro has but little share\r\neither in making the laws or in administering them.\r\n\r\n252. URGENT NATURE OF THE NEGRO PROBLEM.--The Negro problem was never\r\nof more pressing importance than it is to-day. Illiteracy is still\r\nperilously high, Negro crime is becoming more serious, and the\r\ncityward tendency of the Negro is increasing his susceptibility to\r\ndisease and vice. In spite of prohibitive laws, racial intermixture is\r\ncontinuing, and the problem of the mixed blood is becoming more and\r\nmore acute. Social unrest among the masses of southern Negroes is\r\nincreasing. The World War created new aims and aspirations among\r\nthousands of Negroes. New leaders are arising to preach racial\r\nequality for the Negro; old leaders are in many cases becoming more\r\nimpatient with the attitude of the white population.\r\n\r\n253. HESITANCY IN ATTACKING THE PROBLEM.--The American people have\r\nbeen singularly backward about grappling with the problem of fitting\r\nten million Negro citizens into the fabric of American democracy. One\r\nexplanation of this backwardness is that until recently many have\r\nbelieved that the Negro would die out under freedom. This expectation\r\nhas not been realized, for while the Negro population is increasing\r\nless rapidly than is the white population, it is nevertheless\r\nincreasing. The Negro is not dying out. Nor can he be deported to\r\nLiberia or other colonies, as was often suggested in the last century.\r\nThe Negro is here to stay, and his problems must be solved.\r\n\r\n254. NEED OF A CONSISTENT PROGRAM.--Many institutions and individuals\r\nhave attacked various phases of the Negro problem with courage and\r\nsuccess, but we are in need of a unified and comprehensive program\r\nrather than of a series of unrelated endeavors. Above all what is\r\nneeded is not impassioned opinion or cure-all schemes, but rather the\r\ndevelopment of a sound and comprehensive program which shall attack\r\nthe problem from a number of angles at the same time. Such a program\r\nmust have a double end in view: First, the immediate needs of the\r\nNegro must be met; second, we must permit the Negro to be trained\r\ntoward a position in which he will be able to play a useful and\r\nhonorable role in our national life. Thus the great comprehensive\r\npurpose of this program is to help the Negro adapt himself to American\r\nlife, to aid him in fitting in with our economic, social, and\r\npolitical institutions, and to encourage him to contribute to the\r\ndevelopment of American culture to the best of his ability.\r\n\r\n255. EDUCATION.--Education is the most important element of any\r\nprogram designed to help the Negro. Ability to read and write, the\r\nhabit of study, training in correct thinking, all are of such basic\r\nvalue that it is difficult to understand why we have so long neglected\r\nthe education of the Negro. We spend three or four times as much for\r\nthe education of the white child _per capita_ as for the education of\r\nthe Negro child. Negro schools are sparsely distributed; they are\r\npoorly equipped, and they are sadly hampered by lack of competent\r\nteachers. Clearly we must spend vast sums on Negro education, if we\r\nare to expect marked improvement in the Negro's social and economic\r\ncondition. We cannot expect the Negro to cease being a problem until\r\nhe has been trained in the fundamentals of citizenship. \"The\r\ninadequate provision for the education of the Negro,\" says the\r\nSouthern University Race Commission, \"is more than an injustice to\r\nhim; it is an injury to the white man. The South cannot realize its\r\ndestiny if one third of its population is undeveloped and\r\ninefficient.\"\r\n\r\n256. ECONOMIC ADJUSTMENT.--The Negro cannot be expected to become a\r\nthrifty, responsible citizen until he is rendered capable of earning a\r\ndecent living at productive work. He must acquire the habit of working\r\nsteadily and efficiently under a system of free contract. This\r\neconomic readjustment, many students of the Negro problem believe,\r\nwill be attained largely through industrial education. We already have\r\nseveral excellent industrial training schools for Negroes, including\r\nHampton and Tuskegee. The latter was made famous by Booker T.\r\nWashington, an ex-slave who devoted his life to the economic\r\nreadjustment of his people.\r\n\r\nA great deal more must be done in this direction. In spite of the\r\nexcellent beginnings made at Hampton and Tuskegee, not more than one\r\nper cent of our Negroes have the privilege of industrial education.\r\nMore adequate instruction is needed in methods of agriculture and\r\nstock raising, in the various crafts, and in those professions for\r\nwhich the Negro seems fitted. The South needs labor badly, but she\r\ncannot use her millions of Negroes effectively until they are turned\r\ninto competent and dependable workers. The Negro appears to have\r\nlittle aptitude for mechanical work, or for mill and factory\r\nemployment. Diversified agriculture on a small scale seems to be the\r\nmost promising industry for him, and one in which he ought\r\nconsistently to be encouraged.\r\n\r\n257. THE NEED FOR COÍPERATION.--No permanent solution of the Negro's\r\ndifficulties can be attained without the friendly co÷peration of all\r\nparties concerned. Most of our Negroes live in the South, but the\r\nNegro is no more a purely southern question than Japanese immigration\r\nis a purely Californian problem. We are one nation, and the problems\r\nof one section are the problems of the whole. The South must not be\r\nleft alone, either to neglect the Negro, or to struggle with his\r\ndifficulties as best she can. Generous aid must be extended her by the\r\nNorth, East, and West, before we can expect a solution of the Negro\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, there must be co÷peration between the leaders of the\r\nNegro and white races, otherwise energy will be wasted and inter-\r\nracial bitterness created. Very promising beginnings in this direction\r\nhave recently been made in the South. Nevertheless it is to be\r\nregretted that many leaders, both white and Negro, are still prone to\r\npropose \"remedies\" for the Negro problem which serve their own\r\ninterests, but which show little or no regard for the rights of the\r\nother group, or for the welfare of the nation.\r\n\r\nAbove all, there must be a firm resolve to work toward a fair\r\nsolution, and an earnest desire to be just and humane. Hard and\r\nunpleasant facts cannot be argued away, but at least they can be\r\ntreated rationally. No solution can be reached except through law and\r\norder. Neither violence nor deceit can solve this or any other\r\nproblem. Race riots and lynchings are proof that those who engage in\r\nthem are unfit to carry on the work of American democracy.\r\n\r\n258. THE PROMISE OF THE NEGRO.--There is a good deal of discussion as\r\nto whether or not the Negro race is merely backward, or whether it is\r\nan inferior race. Those contending that the Negro is only backward\r\nbelieve that ultimately he can be fitted into the fabric of American\r\nlife; those insisting that he is inferior declare that all attempts to\r\nadapt the Negro to American life will prove unavailing.\r\n\r\nAcademic discussions of this sort are not to the point. As to whether\r\nor not the Negro is backward or inferior, and as to precisely what\r\neach of these terms implies, there must always be a good deal of\r\ndispute. For practical purposes it is enough to admit that the Negro\r\ncannot now do many of the things which the average white man can do,\r\nand that in so far as this is true, the Negro is less effective as a\r\ncitizen.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, it should be frankly recognized that the Negro has\r\nshown himself capable of substantial progress. It will be more\r\nappropriate to discuss the inferiority of the Negro when he has failed\r\nto react to the most comprehensive, intelligent, and consistent\r\nprogram which we are able to draw up. This we have not yet done, and\r\nuntil it is done, we shall have less cause to deny to the Negro a\r\ncapacity for civilization than the Negro will have cause to complain\r\nof our unhelpful attitude toward him. So far as we now know, there is\r\nno scientific justification for believing that the masses of American\r\nNegroes cannot ultimately be trained to a useful sphere in American\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS ON THE TEXT\r\n\r\n1.

SIGNIFICANCE OF THE FAMILY.--From whatever angle we approach\r\nsociety, the family is the ultimate unit and basis. The whole fabric\r\nof civilization, whether considered from an economic, a social, or a\r\npolitical standpoint, depends upon the integrity of the family, and\r\nupon the wholesomeness of the home life centering about the father,\r\nmother, and children. The home is the nursery of our fundamental\r\ninstitutions: it is the origin of our physical and mental\r\ninheritances; it is the center of our training for private and public\r\nlife; it is the moral and religious fount which nourishes the ideals\r\nand beliefs which fashion our lives and mould our character. A nation\r\nbuilt upon decaying homes is bound to perish; a nation composed of\r\nnormal prosperous families is in a good way to perpetuate itself. It\r\nis of the very greatest importance, therefore, that we inquire into\r\nthe character and tendencies of the American family.\r\n\r\n260. THE FAMILY IN THE MIDDLE AGES.--Fully to appreciate the nature of\r\nthe modern family we must know something of the family as it existed\r\nin Europe in the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\nUnity was the striking characteristic of the medieval family.\r\nEconomically it was very nearly self-sufficing, that is to say, most\r\nof the food, clothing, and other necessities consumed by it were\r\nprepared by the family members. Very little in the way of education\r\nand recreation existed beyond the family circle. In religious\r\nactivities the family played an important role, family worship under\r\nthe leadership of the father being a common domestic function. The\r\nmedieval family was stable, partly because legal and religious\r\nauthority was concentrated in the hands of the father, partly because\r\nthe family members were economically interdependent, and partly\r\nbecause the social and religious interests of the family members\r\ntended to coincide. Divorce was uncommon, and the children generally\r\nremained in the home until their majority had been attained.\r\n\r\n261. THE FAMILY IN MODERN TIMES.--We have already seen that since the\r\nclose of the Middle Ages, and especially during the last two\r\ncenturies, important economic, social, and political changes have been\r\ngoing on in civilized society. In common with other social\r\ninstitutions, the family has been greatly influenced by these changes.\r\nThe family which we have described as the medieval type has been\r\neither destroyed or greatly modified, and a new type is being\r\ndeveloped. Probably this new type of family will present substantial\r\ngains over the family of the Middle Ages, nevertheless the period of\r\ntransition is fraught with danger. A great problem of American\r\ndemocracy is to aid in the social readjustment of the family. In order\r\nthat we may be competent to aid in this readjustment, let us discover\r\nin what ways the family has been modified by the economic, social, and\r\npolitical changes referred to above.\r\n\r\n262. THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION AND THE FAMILY.--We have examined\r\nsomewhat in detail the effect of the Industrial Revolution upon our\r\neconomic life; it remains to be pointed out that the same phenomenon\r\nhas profoundly affected the character of our most vital social\r\ninstitution, the family.\r\n\r\nDirectly or indirectly, the Industrial Revolution has affected family\r\nlife among all classes of the population. To some extent capitalism\r\nhas given rise to a class of idle rich, living upon the proceeds of\r\npermanent investments, and resorting to extravagance and loose methods\r\nof living in order to occupy their time. This development is doubly\r\nunfortunate. In the first place it renders difficult the maintenance\r\nof normal homes among the idle rich. In the second place, the tendency\r\nof certain types of individuals to imitate and envy the idle rich\r\nencourages false standards and leads to a depraved moral sense.\r\n\r\nTo those classes which furnish the majority of our professional men,\r\nthe complex division of labor has brought a serious danger. So great\r\nis the need of specialized training among these groups that marriage\r\nis often delayed until after the age of thirty. The individual is then\r\nin a better position to support a family, but often his habits are so\r\nfirmly fixed that he finds it difficult to adapt himself to family\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nEven more important, perhaps, have been the effects of the Industrial\r\nRevolution upon the masses of wage earners. Men earning low wages are\r\noften unable to marry, or, if they assume that responsibility, they\r\nare unable properly to support their families. In spite of the fact\r\nthat capitalism has greatly increased our material welfare, the\r\ndependence of large numbers of people upon day wages increases the\r\nhazards of family life. Industrial accidents, occupational diseases,\r\nor the interruption of earnings by strikes and unemployment,--any one\r\nof these mishaps may work a hardship upon the wage-earner's family.\r\nPoverty may induce child labor, deprive the family of proper food and\r\nother necessities, and retard the education of the children. Finally\r\nit may so emphasize the elements of strain and worry that parents are\r\nunable to give proper attention to the training of their children.\r\n\r\n263. THE FACTORY SYSTEM AND THE HOME.--The Industrial Revolution has\r\nlessened the economic importance of the home. The typical modern\r\nfamily is no longer self-sufficing, but is dependent upon the factory\r\nsystem for many commodities formerly prepared within the home circle.\r\nSpinning, weaving, tailoring, shoe-making, soap-making, and other\r\nindustries have moved out of the home and into the factory. Even the\r\npreparation of food is increasingly a function of agencies outside the\r\nhome. Especially in cities there has been a steady development of\r\nrestaurants, delicatessen shops, and factories engaged in the large-\r\nscale preparation of bread, canned soups, and other food products.\r\n\r\nThere is thus less work to be done in the home than formerly; at the\r\nsame time the development of our industrial life has notably increased\r\nthe amount of work to be done outside the home. The outcome of these\r\ntwo complementary forces has been that not only the father, but often\r\nthe mother and the half-grown children as well, have been drawn into\r\nindustry. As the result of this development, the economic\r\ninterdependence of the family has been destroyed, and the way has been\r\nopened to the disintegration of the home. Social contacts between\r\nfamily members have decreased, while the specialized character of the\r\nindividual's daily work has operated to break down the common\r\ninterests which family members formerly had outside the home.\r\n\r\n264. LACK OF PREPARATION FOR HOME-MAKING.--The factory system has\r\nrendered more difficult the preparation of our boys and girls for\r\nhome-making. Where boys go out to work at an early age and are\r\ndeprived of home training during the adolescent period, neither father\r\nnor mother has the opportunity properly to acquaint them with the\r\nnature and responsibilities of home-making. Girls very often are\r\nreared without adequate knowledge of cooking, sewing, and other\r\nhousehold arts. This is due, partly to the transfer of many of the\r\ndomestic functions to specialists beyond the home, and partly to the\r\nfact that where girls go into industry they spend most of their time\r\noutside the home. In the case of both boys and girls, the decreased\r\namount of time spent in the home not only prevents proper training by\r\nthe parents, but it stresses outside interests which are too often\r\nopposed to domestic ideals. Many parents either allow or encourage\r\ntheir children to acquire frivolous habits. As the result of all of\r\nthese factors, both young men and young women frequently marry without\r\nhaving been properly prepared for the responsibilities of home-making.\r\n\r\n265. DIFFICULTIES OF HOME-MAKING IN CROWDED CITIES.--With the\r\ndevelopment of manufacturing, a larger and larger proportion of our\r\npeople have made their homes in large cities. To many, city life has\r\nbrought increased opportunities for education and recreation,\r\nnevertheless it is difficult to maintain a normal home life in a\r\ncrowded city. Urban life is highly artificial Simple and wholesome\r\namusements are less common than expensive and injurious forms of\r\nrecreation. The noise and jar of city life often result in strain and\r\njaded nerves. The scarcity and high cost of house room is, for many\r\ncity dwellers, an unavoidable evil. The poor are cramped into small,\r\nuncomfortable tenements, while even the well-to-do are frequently\r\nfound in congested apartment houses. Under such circumstances, the\r\nhome often becomes merely a lodging place. Social life is developed\r\nout of, rather than in, the home. For the children of the poor there\r\nis often no yard and no adequate provision for recreation. Among the\r\nrich, conditions are somewhat better, though in fashionable apartment\r\nhouses children are frequently objected to by neighboring tenants or\r\nbanned by landlords.\r\n\r\n266. ECONOMIC INDEPENDENCE OF WOMEN.--Until very recently a married\r\nwoman was economically dependent upon her husband. But one of the\r\neffects of the Industrial Revolution has been to make many women\r\neconomically independent. Women are entering the industrial field with\r\ngreat rapidity, and their presence there is now taken as a matter of\r\ncourse. Many women now avoid marriage, partly because domestic\r\ninterests fail to attract them, and partly because they have become\r\ngenuinely interested in industry. Where domesticity is the ultimate\r\naim, many women delay marriage because self-support renders them both\r\nable and desirous of retaining their independence for a considerable\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nDomestic tranquillity is sometimes disturbed by the fact that wives\r\nwere formerly self-supporting girls. In most cases wives are dependent\r\nupon their husbands in money matters, a situation which is apt to\r\nirritate women who were formerly self-supporting. The husband is often\r\ninclined to rate the generalized character of housework as being of\r\nless importance than his own highly specialized work. The wife's\r\nirritation at this may be increased by the fact that often she, too,\r\nbelieves that her domestic duties are less dignified and less valuable\r\nthan her former work.\r\n\r\nNot only has the former independence of the wife made her less\r\ntolerant of domestic wrongs and slights, but the realization that she\r\ncan support herself, frequently encourages her to seek a divorce. The\r\ntemptation to take this step is increased by the fact that public\r\nopinion now rarely frowns upon a divorced woman. This is in striking\r\ncontrast to the situation two hundred years ago, when most divorced\r\nwomen were not only unable to support themselves, but were socially\r\nostracized.\r\n\r\n267. POLITICAL EMANCIPATION OF WOMEN.--Until very recently women have\r\nbeen legally and politically subordinate to men. As recently as a\r\ncentury ago women in the leading countries of the world were allowed\r\nneither to vote, nor to contract debts in their own name, nor to hold\r\nor will property.\r\n\r\nBut within the last century women have been emancipated politically.\r\nProperty rights have been extended them; the growth of the woman's\r\nmovement has resulted in the winning of female suffrage. Economic\r\nindependence and social freedom have combined with political\r\nemancipation to emphasize the spirit of individualism among women.\r\nPolitics and club work have, in the eyes of many wives and mothers,\r\nbecome more attractive than domestic concerns, with a resultant\r\nneglect of the home. Higher education for women, including a wider\r\nknowledge of legal matters, has acquainted women with their legal\r\nrights and privileges, and has made them familiar with the steps\r\nnecessary to secure a divorce.\r\n\r\n268. INDIVIDUALISM MAY BE EXAGGERATED.--The American people are\r\ncelebrated for their strongly individualistic character. This trait is\r\nclosely related to the initiative and self-reliance which have helped\r\ntoward our industrial success; on the other hand, individualism may be\r\ncarried to the point of selfishness. It is desirable, of course, that\r\nboth men and women maintain high standards of living, and that they\r\ncultivate their respective personalities. It should be noted, however,\r\nthat marriage is often delayed or altogether avoided because of\r\nselfish ambition and the desire to live a care-free and self-centered\r\nlife. The insistence which many young people place upon personal\r\nrights has encouraged the belief that marriage is intended for man's\r\nand woman's convenience, rather than for the building of normal homes\r\nand the development of community life. In too many marriages the\r\ncontracting parties selfishly refuse to make the mutual concessions\r\nnecessary in married life and so wreck their domestic happiness.\r\n\r\n269. THE DIVORCE EVIL.--Family instability has been increased by the\r\ndemoralizing influences which we have been discussing. A familiar\r\nsymptom of family instability is the divorce rate. One out of every\r\neight or nine marriages in the United States is dissolved by divorce.\r\nNot only do we have more divorces than all of the rest of the world\r\ntogether, but our divorce rate is increasing three times as fast as is\r\nour population.\r\n\r\nThe value of these statistics is affected by two factors. In the first\r\nplace, much domestic unhappiness does not express itself in the\r\nseparation of husband and wife. Or, where such separation does take\r\nplace, it may not be through the divorce court. Among the city poor,\r\nfor example, desertion is four times as common as is divorce. Thus the\r\ndivorce rate indicates only a share of family instability.\r\n\r\nThe second modifying factor, however, lessens the force of our divorce\r\nstatistics. A high divorce rate is to be interpreted with care. Our\r\ndivorce rate is higher than that of European countries, but it should\r\nbe remembered that in those countries where customs, laws, and\r\nreligious beliefs are relatively conservative, families may be held\r\ntogether legally in spite of the fact that they have already\r\ndisintegrated. Thus family life may be as unstable in a country in\r\nwhich the divorce rate is low, as in a country in which the divorce\r\nrate is high.\r\n\r\n270. LAXITY OF OUR DIVORCE LAWS.--Although divorce may sometimes be\r\nnecessary, it is clear that in many of the states of the Union divorce\r\nlaws are too lax. The practice of the states as regards divorce is\r\ndivergent: in South Carolina divorce is absolutely prohibited; in the\r\nremaining states there is a variable number of grounds upon which\r\ndivorce may be secured. Divorces are often rushed through the courts,\r\npartly because of the overworked character of the divorce tribunals,\r\nand partly because public opinion tolerates the lax administration of\r\ndivorce laws. In some states divorces have been secured in fifteen\r\nminutes, being granted without any attempt at solemnity, with no\r\nadequate investigation, and with numerous opportunities for collusion\r\nbetween the parties involved. The effect of this laxness has been to\r\nencourage the dissolution of the home for trivial and improper causes.\r\n\r\n271. THE QUESTION OF STRICTER DIVORCE LAWS.--Uniform divorce laws\r\namong the several states are now being agitated. The essential\r\nprovisions of such laws may be outlined as follows: It is desirable to\r\nhave a court of domestic relations, which shall carefully and wisely\r\nattempt a reconciliation of husband and wife before divorce\r\nproceedings are resorted to. Applicants for divorce should be _bona\r\nfide_ residents of the state in which the suit is filed, and should be\r\nrequired to reside in the state two years before a decree of absolute\r\ndivorce is granted. In some states at least, the number of grounds\r\nupon which divorce may be secured should be reduced. An adequate\r\ninvestigation should be undertaken, both in order to determine the\r\njustice of the suit, and to prevent collusion. The primary aim of the\r\ndivorce laws should be to allow relief from a vicious and hopelessly\r\nwrecked union, but at the same time to prevent the misuse of the\r\nstatutes by irresponsible and unscrupulous persons.\r\n\r\n272. LAXITY OF OUR MARRIAGE LAWS.--The fact that unwise marriages are\r\nan immediate cause of divorce leads back to the question of our\r\nmarriage laws. Marriage laws often permit the mating of couples unfit\r\nfor home-making. In some states the authorities are not overcareful to\r\nprevent the marriage of persons who are mentally defective. There is\r\namong the several states no agreement as to the legal age of marriage,\r\nand no agreement as to the relationship within which marriage is\r\nforbidden. Hasty unions have been encouraged by the lack of solemnity\r\nwhich characterizes civil marriage. Marriage is more and more a civil\r\ncontract, devoid of religious sanctions and spiritual associations.\r\nMany consider marriage as a civil relation not radically different\r\nfrom any other contract. The effect of this changed attitude has been\r\nto encourage the enactment of loose marriage laws, and the careless\r\nadministration of sound marriage laws.\r\n\r\n273. THE QUESTION OF STRICTER MARRIAGE LAWS.--Stricter marriage laws\r\nare being advocated in many states. We know far too little about\r\neugenics to warrant prediction as to the type of individuals best\r\nfitted to build normal homes, but it is clearly desirable to prohibit\r\nthe marriage of all mental defectives. There are also good reasons for\r\nthe restriction of the marriage of minors, of persons between whose\r\nages there is a wide disparity, and of persons who are members of\r\nwidely divergent races. It would probably check hasty marriages to\r\nincrease the length of time elapsing between the issuance of the\r\nmarriage license and the performance of the ceremony. If modern\r\nmarriages were more distinctly upon a religious basis, it is likely\r\nthat many persons who now rush thoughtlessly into marriage would be\r\nled seriously to reflect upon the significance of the step.\r\n\r\n274. LAW NOT THE UTLIMATE REMEDY FOR FAMILY INSTABILITY.--The careful\r\nenactment and wise administration of sound laws on marriage and\r\ndivorce will undoubtedly check the number of unhappy and unsuccessful\r\nmarriages. Nevertheless, law is not the ultimate remedy for family\r\ninstability. Unduly restrictive marriage laws may result in abnormal\r\ntendencies among certain classes of the population, while severe\r\nprohibitions upon divorce may prevent individuals from securing\r\nrelease from a hopelessly wrecked marriage. Divorce is only a symptom\r\nof deeper-lying evils. Really to remove the dangers which threaten the\r\nintegrity of the family we must go deeper than legislation.\r\n\r\n275. ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL READJUSTMENT.--One fundamental method of\r\nsafeguarding the family is to counteract the injurious effects of the\r\nIndustrial Revolution. Poverty must be lessened or eliminated, so that\r\nmen will be enabled to marry and support families decently. The evils\r\nof overcrowding must be attacked in the interest of a normal home\r\nlife. Mothers' pensions and social insurance are desirable methods of\r\nprotecting the laborer's family against the risks of industry. The\r\nprohibition of child labor and the safeguarding of women in industry\r\nwill also tend to keep the family intact, and to permit proper home\r\ntraining. In short, any measures which will help individuals to adjust\r\nthemselves to the economic and social changes of the present age will\r\nprovide a more firm and solid foundation for a normal family life.\r\n\r\n276. EDUCATION AND THE FAMILY.--Far more fundamental than legislation\r\non marriage and divorce is the training of young people toward a\r\nfuller appreciation of the responsibilities of home-making. In the\r\nproblem of family instability, laws reach symptoms, while education\r\nattacks causes. By education is here meant not merely formal training\r\nin the school, but character-building of every type. This includes\r\ntraining in the home, in the school, and in the church. Only when boys\r\nand girls are accorded sound training by these various agencies will\r\nthey be properly prepared to make homes.\r\n\r\nOur whole educational system ought to emphasize the importance of a\r\npure and wholesome family life. The sanctity of the marriage bond, the\r\nseriousness of family responsibilities, and the duty to rear a normal\r\nhealthy family, ought to be impressed upon every boy and girl. Young\r\npeople should be taught to consider adolescence as a period of\r\npreparation for home-building. During this period it is the duty of\r\nthe boy to fit himself for the proper support of a family, while the\r\ngirl ought to feel obligated to become familiar with the tasks and\r\nduties of housekeeping. The choice of a husband or wife ought to be\r\nmade, not on the basis of passing fancy, but with regard to a life of\r\nmutual service. Extreme individualism ought to be discouraged;\r\npersonal pleasure ought to be interpreted in the light of marriage as\r\na partnership. Above all, marriage should be faced with the\r\nrealization that it requires adaptation and concessions on the part of\r\nboth husband and wife. Mutual consideration and respect must\r\npredominate in the future American family, while the spirit of\r\nimpatience and selfishness must be eliminated.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS ON THE TEXT\r\n\r\n1.

THE MEDIEVAL NEIGHBORHOOD.--Throughout the earlier part of the\r\nmedieval period the majority of the common people of western Europe\r\nlived in small agricultural communities. There was little in the way\r\nof trade or travel, for the area comprising the village or the feudal\r\nmanor was relatively self-sufficing. The interests of the people\r\ncentered almost wholly about the local neighborhood into which they\r\nhad been born, and in which they lived and died. Life was stable, and\r\nthe daily work of the peasants entailed few hazards. When, because of\r\nillness or accident, individuals were temporarily unable to support\r\nthemselves, informal aid was extended them by neighbors and friends.\r\nIn case of a more serious dependency, growing out of physical or\r\nmental defect, for example, the aid extended by neighbors might be\r\nsupplemented by help from the feudal lord. The few strangers in the\r\ncommunity found the monasteries always open to them, regardless of the\r\ncharacter of their need.\r\n\r\n278. BREAKDOWN OF THE MEDIEVAL NEIGHBORHOOD.--During the latter half\r\nof the medieval period, and during the earlier part of the modern\r\nperiod, a number of factors combined to break down this early type of\r\nneighborhood. The Crusades, the decay of feudalism, and the\r\nRenaissance disrupted the stable, isolated, and self-sufficing life of\r\nthe medieval neighborhood. The discovery of America and the growth of\r\ntowns and cities stimulated trade and travel. People moved about more,\r\nstrangers came into the community, family contacts and friendships\r\nwere broken, and community life became more impersonal. For many\r\npeople a change of habitation or of occupation increased the hazards\r\nof life, while the decline of the neighborhood spirit made informal\r\naid by neighbors and friends less available. To meet the growing needs\r\nof the dependent classes, the Church extended and improved its system\r\nof almsgiving. To a greater extent than ever before the monasteries\r\nbecame havens of refuge for the helpless and friendless. The clergy\r\nnot only themselves dispensed alms, but encouraged the wealthy laity\r\nto do likewise.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, however, the aim of almsgiving in this period was not\r\nso much to help the dependent back to self-support, as to increase the\r\npiety of the individual dispensing the alms. Pauperism was looked upon\r\nas inevitable, and the moral effect upon the giver was generally of\r\nmore importance than was the use that the needy made of the alms\r\nreceived.\r\n\r\n279. RISE OF THE URBAN NEIGHBORHOOD.--The breakdown of the medieval\r\nneighborhood was completed by the Industrial Revolution. The factory\r\nsystem drew large numbers of countrymen to the cities. Here they\r\nworked long hours in insanitary work-shops, and lived in crowded\r\ntenements devoid of many improvements which we now regard as necessary\r\nto health and comfort. Home life was disrupted, and neighborhood ties\r\nwere broken in the process of adjusting agricultural laborers to the\r\nfactory system. The medieval neighborhood began to be supplanted by a\r\nnew type of neighborhood, one primarily urban and impersonal in\r\ncharacter. This new type of neighborhood brought with it greater\r\nhazards for the poor, and at the same time offered fewer opportunities\r\nfor mutual aid between neighbors. Under such circumstances, the\r\nproblem of dependency became increasingly serious.\r\n\r\n280. EXTENT OF DEPENDENCY IN MODERN TIMES.--One of the vital problems\r\nof American democracy is the proper care of those individuals who are\r\nunable, either to support themselves, or otherwise to protect\r\nthemselves against the hazards of modern life. The extent to which\r\nindividuals are dependent for help upon agencies outside their family\r\ncircle is unknown. Statistics are meager, and the complex nature of\r\ndependency renders it difficult of measurement. Perhaps a reasonable\r\nestimate of dependency in the United States is that at some time\r\nduring the year about five per cent of the population seeks charitable\r\nassistance. The total amount expended annually for the care of the\r\ndependent classes in the United States is more than half a billion\r\ndollars.\r\n\r\n281. CAUSES OF DEPENDENCY.--The causes of dependency in a modern\r\ncommunity are difficult to analyze. Generally the applicant for\r\ncharity is not in a state of dependency because of a single isolated\r\ncause, but because of a number of combined causes, interlocking in a\r\nmost confusing way. In the effort to throw light upon this tangled\r\nsituation, let us briefly survey the problem from the economic,\r\nsocial, personal, and political viewpoint.\r\n\r\nFrom the economic viewpoint much dependency is the result of\r\nmaladjustments in industry. Most laborers have little or no savings,\r\nso that when unemployment, strikes, industrial accidents, or crises\r\ninterrupt their earnings, they are soon forced to fall back upon\r\ncharity. Economic causes figure in from fifty to eighty per cent of\r\ncharity cases, either as minor or major factors. In the majority of\r\nthese cases the unemployment or other handicap of the laborer is due\r\nto industrial maladjustments beyond his power to control.\r\n\r\nClosely connected with the economic causes of dependency are the\r\nsocial causes. The crowding of large numbers of workmen into cities\r\nleads to abnormal living conditions, which encourage ill-health,\r\ndisease, and vice. Among unskilled laborers, poverty and the large\r\nnumber of children often prevent the young from securing a helpful\r\namount of education. The lack of wholesome and inexpensive recreation,\r\nand the existence of costly and injurious forms of entertainment,\r\nencourage unwise expenditure of savings, and, to that extent, may\r\ninfluence dependency. Child labor and the employment of mothers in\r\nindustry prevent a normal family life, and may be intimately\r\nassociated with illiteracy, low moral standards, and pauperism.\r\n\r\nOften indistinguishable from social causes are the personal causes of\r\ndependency. Laziness, irresponsibility, and thriftlessness figure in\r\nfrom ten to fifteen per cent of charity cases. Penniless old age is\r\noften the outcome of bad personal habits in youth and middle life.\r\nIdling, gambling, and other vicious habits are important causes of\r\npauperism. Sickness is a factor in at least a third of charity cases,\r\nwhile disease figures in seventy-five per cent of such cases. Physical\r\nor mental defect is of great importance in dependency, often\r\naccompanying bad personal habits as either cause or effect. The\r\nfeeble-minded, the epileptic, and the insane constitute a serious\r\nburden upon the community.\r\n\r\nDefects in government have in some cases either encouraged dependency,\r\nor have perpetuated it. In so far as we have neglected legislation\r\ndesigned to reduce the force of industrial maladjustments, political\r\nfactors may be said markedly to influence dependency. Our tardiness in\r\nprotecting the labor of women and children is certainly responsible\r\nfor a share of dependency. Our failure to adopt a comprehensive\r\nprogram of social insurance has added to the burden upon charity.\r\nHousing is receiving more and more attention in our cities, yet the\r\nliving quarters in many districts continue to be sources of ill-health\r\nand vice. Probably we shall eliminate a share of dependency when we\r\nshall have established a comprehensive system of state and Federal\r\nemployment bureaus. The wise restriction of immigration is also\r\nimportant, as is the matter of vocational education for the unskilled\r\nclasses.\r\n\r\n282. THE GIVING OF ALMS.--Until the period of the Reformation in\r\nEurope, the distribution of alms by the clergy and by pious laymen was\r\nthe chief method of dealing with the problem of dependency. Then the\r\nReformation crippled the temporal power of the Church, and\r\necclesiastical almsgiving declined in importance. The place formerly\r\nheld by the Church was filled, partly by public almshouses or\r\nworkhouses, and partly by indiscriminate and unorganized almsgiving on\r\nthe part of kind-hearted individuals. Individuals distributed alms\r\nchiefly to dependents with whom they were personally acquainted, and\r\nwhose needs could be effectively met without their being removed to an\r\ninstitution. Wandering dependents, and unfortunates whose needs were\r\nrelatively serious and permanent, were cared for in the almshouse.\r\nThis latter institution developed very early in England, and appeared\r\nin colonial America in the seventeenth century. Until about 1850 it\r\nwas often the only institution in American communities which cared for\r\nthe helpless adult dependent. The almshouse, as it existed in this\r\ncountry a few decades ago, has been described as a charitable catch-\r\nall, into which were crowded paupers, the insane, the feeble-minded,\r\nthe blind, the orphaned, and other types of dependents.\r\n\r\n283. ALMSGIVNG PROVES INADEQUATE.--The attempt to meet the problem of\r\nmodern dependency solely by the giving of alms illustrates the\r\ndifficulty of employing an ancient and simple method of treatment for\r\na disease which has become highly complex.\r\n\r\nAlmsgiving by individuals very often pauperizes rather than helps the\r\nindividual to help himself. When the dominant aim of the almsgiver is\r\nto satisfy himself as to his piety, it is only by accident that the\r\nalms really help the recipient. Very often what is needed is not money\r\nor material aid in other form, but wise direction and friendly advice.\r\nThere is still a great deal of unwise and indiscriminate almsgiving by\r\nindividuals, but the spread of new ideals of social help is probably\r\ncutting down the amount.\r\n\r\nThe almshouse, as it existed in the last century, was productive of\r\nmuch evil. Very often superintendents were allowed to run these\r\ninstitutions for personal profit, a practice which allowed the\r\nexploitation and neglect of the inmates. The practice of herding into\r\nthis generalized institution every variety of dependent had great\r\ndrawbacks. Specialized care and treatment were impossible. Disease was\r\ntransmitted, and vice encouraged, by the failure properly to segregate\r\nvarious types of dependents. Inmates were in many cases allowed to\r\nenter and leave the institution at will, a privilege which encouraged\r\nshiftlessness and improvidence.\r\n\r\n284. THE EVOLUTION OF NEW IDEALS.--After the middle of the last\r\ncentury our attitude toward the dependent classes began to change\r\nrapidly. There was a gradual abandonment of almsgiving as the sole\r\nmethod of attacking dependency. Rising standards of conduct\r\ncontributed to the development of new ideals, some of them now fairly\r\nwell established, and some of them still in the formative process. The\r\ngeneral content of these new ideals may be briefly described as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nThe primary aim of those who come in contact with the dependent\r\nclasses should be to help those classes, rather than to satisfy pious\r\naspirations or to indulge sentimental promptings. Rather than\r\nbelieving that alms are helpful because they are gratefully received,\r\nwe should first discover what will help the dependent, and then train\r\nourselves and him to take satisfaction in that which is helpful.\r\n\r\nPoverty is not to be taken for granted. It is neither inevitable nor\r\nirremedial. It is a social disease which we must attack with the aim\r\nof destroying.\r\n\r\nWhen individuals are found in an emergency they should be given\r\nrelief, regardless of personal merit. The extension of relief in case\r\nof fire, flood or other accident is only an act of humanity.\r\n\r\nA different and more productive form of help is remedial work. This\r\ntype of work often accompanies and follows relief work. It is\r\ncorrective, for example, the finding of employment for a friendless\r\nman, or the medical treatment of a sick man, is remedial work.\r\n\r\nA still higher form of social work is preventive. Hand in hand with\r\nthe giving of work to friendless men, and the curing of sick men, for\r\nexample, we must undertake measures which will prevent a recurrence of\r\nunemployment on the one hand, and illness on the other. Preventive\r\nwork is often indirect, but ultimately it is the most important type\r\nof social work.\r\n\r\nRecently there has been a reaction against almsgiving or pure charity,\r\nand a distinct tendency to develop what may be called the concept of\r\nsocial service. Charity is too often concerned with the pauper class;\r\nsocial service is a wider term and includes not only what was formerly\r\nknown as charity, but also child welfare, settlement work, folk\r\ndancing, and other socializing activities which are helpful in a\r\nmodern community, but which have nothing to do with alms. Charity too\r\noften pauperizes and degrades; social service encourages self-help and\r\nself-expression in the vital social relations. Formerly charity was\r\nalmost exclusively the function of the pious and the sympathetic; the\r\npresent tendency is for social service to become a distinct\r\nprofession, administered by highly trained specialists.\r\n\r\n285. THE STAGE OF SPECIALIZATION.--One of the signs that we are\r\nrecognizing the growing need of an individualized treatment of\r\ndependents, is the degree to which our social service agencies are\r\nbecoming specialized. The treatment of the dependent may take either\r\nan institutional or a non-institutional form. Let us briefly notice\r\nthe specialization in each of these forms.\r\n\r\nThe almshouse, almost universal a century ago, is being rapidly\r\ndisplaced by a series of specialized institutions. In most states\r\nthere are now separate institutions for the treatment of the\r\npauperized, the diseased, the blind, the deaf, the insane, the feeble-\r\nminded, and the otherwise dependent. Inmates of these institutions are\r\ngiven special treatment by experts. When the defect has been remedied,\r\nthe patient is released; in case remedy is impossible, the individual\r\nis segregated and accorded humane and sympathetic treatment during the\r\nrest of his life. This prevents the untold harm of releasing defective\r\nand irresponsible people into the community. Institutions of this\r\ncharacter are largely under state control, and are intended primarily\r\nfor individuals who cannot be properly treated in their homes.\r\n\r\nDependents who are only slightly or temporarily handicapped, or who\r\nare not in need of special treatment, may be best cared for in their\r\nhomes and by private individuals or associations. In this non-\r\ninstitutional form of social service there is also a high degree of\r\nspecialization. The casual almsgiver has been succeeded by a whole\r\nseries of social service agencies. Prisoners' aid societies,\r\nemployment bureaus, immigrant aid societies, flower missions,\r\nAmericanization clubs, recreation centers, housing clubs, community\r\nnursing clubs, and scores of other organizations have sprung up. Every\r\nlarge city in the United States has several hundred of these\r\norganizations, each attacking social problems of a special type.\r\n\r\n286. NECESSITY OF COÍRDINATION.--Specialization in social service has\r\nbeen followed by the development of means of co÷rdinating the various\r\nspecialized agencies.\r\n\r\nThat there is urgent need of such co÷rdination has been repeatedly\r\ncalled to our attention. It is still true that often the institutions\r\nfor the dependent classes within a single state pursue different\r\nmethods, and so limit their separate fields that many types of\r\ndependents are inadequately cared for.\r\n\r\nAmong the large number of private agencies there has been a great\r\nwaste of time and energy. The fact that each society is independent of\r\nits fellows has meant that in some fields of social service efforts\r\nwere duplicated, while other fields were neglected. Cases demanding\r\ntreatment by several agencies could not be given adequate care because\r\nof the lack of correlation among such agencies. Beggars often imposed\r\nupon a number of different societies by assuming different names. Each\r\nsociety had its own periods of campaigning for funds, a practice which\r\nmeant an excess of tag-days and campaigns and a waste of time and\r\nenergy on the part of social workers.\r\n\r\n287. COÍRDINATION OF PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS.--The co÷rdination of public\r\ninstitutions for the dependent and defective classes proceeded rapidly\r\nafter 1880. At present the situation in the various states is somewhat\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\nThe actual administration of local institutions is generally in the\r\nhands of the town or county authorities. Large cities, however, often\r\nhave a system of institutional relief separate from that of the county\r\nin which they are located. In many states the local authorities are\r\nsubject to some measure of central supervision by a state board, which\r\nis called by various names. In most cases this is merely an advisory\r\nboard with power to inspect state institutions, and to make\r\nrecommendations to the governor or state legislature. More recently,\r\nthere is a tendency to go still further, and to reorganize and\r\nconsolidate the various state institutions so as to bring them\r\ndirectly under the control of a state board or commission. In several\r\nstates the board is already one of control, that is to say, it has the\r\npower not only to inspect the various institutions of the state, but\r\nalso the power to appoint their superintendents, and, in general, to\r\nadminister the institutional relief of the state.\r\n\r\n288. COÍRDINATION OF PRIVATE AGENCIES.--The movement to co÷rdinate\r\nsocial service agencies of a private nature has been relatively slow\r\nand unsatisfactory. This has been due, partly to the large number of\r\nsocieties involved, and partly to the lack of any centralized\r\nauthority to supervise such organizations. In some large cities there\r\nhas been a considerable degree of consolidation among societies which\r\nare purely charitable, but among the large number of social service\r\norganizations which are not purely charitable, the co÷rdinating\r\nprocess has not gone beyond the functional stage. In this stage the\r\nvarious social service agencies of a city remain separate and\r\ndistinct, but may become members of a council or federation which\r\nserves to co÷rdinate their various functions. [Footnote: In this\r\nfunctional co÷rdination the \"consolidated\" or \"united\" charities of\r\nthe city generally appear as a single organization.]\r\n\r\nThe aim of this functional co÷rdination is to secure the greatest\r\ndegree of co÷peration possible without the actual amalgamation of the\r\nco÷perating agencies. Imposition by beggars is unlikely, because a\r\nclearing house of information keeps the various agencies informed as\r\nto the work of one another. By periodic reference to a centralized\r\nsystem of card indices, different societies may keep informed to what\r\ntypes of social work are being duplicated, and as to which lines of\r\neffort are being neglected. Where the social service agencies of a\r\ncity are thus co÷rdinated, an applicant applies to the central agency\r\nand is then directed to the organization best suited to meet his\r\nneeds. Such co÷rdinating agencies stress the necessity of scientific\r\nwork which will aid in the adjustment of personal relations and help\r\nsecure the maximum of result with the minimum of expenditure.\r\n\r\n289. THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE FUTURE.--The small, stable, and\r\nrelatively unprogressive neighborhood of the early European period has\r\ndisappeared before the important economic, social, and political\r\nchanges of the last five centuries. The typical neighborhood of modern\r\ntimes is larger, more inclined to be made up of transient and\r\ndissimilar types of people, and more impersonal. It is more\r\nprogressive, but more likely to hold hazards for the average\r\nindividual. The whole period since the Industrial Revolution has been\r\none of neighborhood readjustment, of which many aspects of the\r\nproblems of crime, the family, and dependency are phases. The new type\r\nof neighborhood has probably come to stay, but there are indications\r\nthat life in the community of the future will prove less and less\r\nhazardous. The development of professional social service, growing out\r\nof the charity movement, but now embracing community work of every\r\nkind, will probably lessen the evils of the modern neighborhood, and\r\nretain its desirable features.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS ON THE TEXT\r\n\r\n1.

THE SIGNIFICANCE OF RURAL LIFE.--Agriculture is our oldest and\r\nmost basic industry. Almost half of our people are found in the rural\r\ndistricts, most of them subsisting directly upon the products of farm,\r\nforest, and range. Directly or indirectly our cities are largely\r\ndependent upon the country. The foodstuffs consumed in cities, as well\r\nas the vast quantities of raw materials used by our manufacturing\r\nindustries, come largely from the rural districts. To some extent even\r\nour urban population is recruited from the ranks of the country folk.\r\nAltogether, American rural life is a matter of vital concern to the\r\nnation. \"Our civilization rests at bottom,\" Theodore Roosevelt once\r\nsaid, \"upon the wholesomeness, the attractiveness, and the\r\ncompleteness, as well as the prosperity, of life in the country.\"\r\n\r\n291. NATURE OF THE RURLAL PROBLEM.--Contrary to popular belief, the\r\nrural problem arises not so much from the actual degeneration of rural\r\nsociety, as from the fact that many rural districts have failed to\r\nprogress as rapidly as have urban communities. Compared with his\r\npredecessor of a century ago, the farmer of to-day is better fed,\r\nbetter clothed and housed, and better able to secure adequate\r\neducation and recreation. At the same time the relatively greater\r\nadvances which urban communities have made in economic and social\r\nactivities render the improvement of rural life highly desirable. The\r\nspecific problem of rural life is to develop in the country economic\r\nand social institutions which are especially adapted to the farmer's\r\nneeds. Not until this is done shall we be able to maintain on our\r\nfarms a class of people who can make the maximum contribution to\r\nAmerican life in all of its phases.\r\n\r\n292. THE RURAL PROBLEM IS OF RECENT ORIGIN.--The most spectacular\r\ndevelopment in American economic life has been the introduction and\r\ngrowth of the factory system. Commerce and manufactures were important\r\nduring even the colonial period, and during the first half century of\r\nour national history our dominant economic interest was the fostering\r\nof manufacturing, domestic trade, and transportation. With the\r\ndevelopment of manufacturing came the growth of the cities, and with\r\nthe growth of the cities added attention was called to immigration,\r\ncrime, health, and related social problems. Farm life, so familiar and\r\napparently so healthful, was not thought of as constituting a national\r\nproblem until late in the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\n293. THE CITYWARD DRIFT.--A half century ago more than three fourths\r\nof our population was rural; to-day less than half of the people of\r\nthe United States live in the country. Both urban and rural districts\r\nhave been steadily increasing in population since the opening of the\r\nnineteenth century, but since 1900 the city population has increased\r\nthree times as fast as has the rural population. One reason for this\r\nmore rapid growth of the cities is that since the eighties the\r\nmajority of our immigrants have flocked to the cities rather than to\r\nthe rural districts. Another reason, however, is that the country\r\npeople have been drifting to the towns and cities. This cityward drift\r\nhas an important bearing upon the character of rural life.\r\n\r\n294. REASONS FOR THE CITYWARD DRIFT.--A number of factors explain the\r\ntendency of rural people to move to the cities. The perfection and\r\nwider use of farm machinery have decreased the need for farm laborers,\r\nand the excess laborers have gone to the towns and cities. The fact\r\nthat urban industries offer shorter hours, better pay, and cleaner\r\nwork than does farming has attracted many young country people. The\r\nisolation of farm life and its frequent lack of comforts have impelled\r\nmany country dwellers to move to the cities. Some country people have\r\ngone to the city in order to be near schools and churches, and in\r\norder to have access to competent doctors and well-equipped hospitals.\r\nThe craving for a more fully developed social life than many rural\r\ndistricts afford, has been an additional cause of the cityward drift.\r\nUnfortunately, the glamour of urban life, with its spectacles and its\r\nartificial pleasures, has also been a factor in the movement away from\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\n295. WHEREIN THE CITYWARD DRIFT IS DESIRABLE.--In some respects the\r\ncityward drift is a desirable development. When laborers who are no\r\nlonger needed on the farms move cityward, the cityward drift may have\r\nthe beneficial effect of removing such laborers to where they can find\r\nemployment. It should also be remembered that successful rural life\r\nrequires qualities which may be lacking in many individuals born and\r\nraised in the country. In so far as the cityward drift is composed of\r\nsuch individuals, it may be a helpful movement, since individuals\r\nunsuited to rural life may find themselves adapted to some type of\r\nurban life. When unneeded and unhelpful individuals are removed from\r\nthe country, the rural population may be more efficient and more\r\nprosperous, even though relatively more sparse.\r\n\r\n296. WHEREIN THE CITYWARD DRIFT IS UNDESIRABLE.--In so far as the\r\ncityward drift brings to the city individuals unsuited to urban\r\nconditions, the movement away from the country may be undesirable. It\r\nis certainly undesirable when the individuals in question are really\r\nsuited to rural life. The tendency of young people to move to the\r\ncities may ultimately deprive the country of its natural leaders.\r\nCertainly the colleges and factories of the cities often drain the\r\ncountry of its most able and ambitious boys and girls. The cityward\r\nmigration of such persons may strengthen the urban population, but it\r\nweakens rural society and retards the progress of rural institutions.\r\n\r\n297. STATUS OF THE \"BACK TO THE LAND\" MOVEMENT.--Some reformers have\r\nsought to offset the cityward drift by an artificial \"back to the\r\nland\" movement. In so far as it would bring to the country persons\r\nreally able to contribute to rural life, this movement is a desirable\r\none. In so far as it would bring to the country persons unprepared or\r\nunable to adapt themselves to rural conditions, such a movement is\r\ninjurious. On the basis of the data now available, we are warranted in\r\nconcluding that the \"back to the land\" movement is founded upon\r\nsentiment and caprice rather than upon sound principles. It attacks\r\nthe rural problem at the wrong end. If the natural leaders of the\r\ncountry are repelled by rural life and attracted by urban conditions,\r\nthe remedy is not to create an artificial movement toward the country,\r\nbut rather to make rural life so attractive that country boys and\r\ngirls will prefer it to city life. The chief question before us is\r\nthis: How can the country be made so attractive that individuals\r\ninterested in, and suited to, rural life may be encouraged to lend\r\nthemselves to its fullest development? Let us see what is being done\r\ntoward answering this question.\r\n\r\n298. HOW THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS HELPING TO MAKE RURAL LIFE\r\nATTRACTIVE.--The material prosperity of the American farmer is due, in\r\nconsiderable part, to the activities of the Federal government. For\r\nmore than a half century the Department of Agriculture has\r\nsystematically encouraged various phases of agricultural industry. The\r\nDepartment conducts investigations and experiments designed to give\r\nfarmers helpful information concerning soils, grains, fruits, and live\r\nstock. It distributes seeds gratuitously, and attempts to encourage\r\nscientific methods among farmers. The Department issues a Year-book, a\r\nMonthly Weather Review, a Crop Reporter, and a series of Farmers'\r\nBulletins. Among the more important subdivisions of the department are\r\nthe bureau of animal industry, the bureau of soils, the bureau of\r\nmarkets, and the office of farm management. The work of the Department\r\nof Agriculture is ably supplemented by the work of the Reclamation\r\nBureau, which, under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior,\r\nis increasing the productivity of waste and arid lands.\r\n\r\n299. THE FEDERAL FARM LOAN ACT.--The growing need of credit facilities\r\namong farmers resulted in 1916 in the passage of the Federal Farm Loan\r\nAct. By the terms of this act, the United States is divided into\r\ntwelve districts, in each of which a Federal land bank is established.\r\nA Federal Farm Loan Board has general charge of the entire system, but\r\neach Farm Loan Bank is allowed a large measure of freedom in its own\r\ndistrict in the organization of local Farm Loan Associations. A local\r\nassociation is made up of a number of farm owners, or persons about to\r\nbecome owners, who desire to borrow money. The Bank will not deal with\r\nthe individual farmer except through the local association, but when a\r\nfarmer has been vouched for by this association, he may receive from\r\nthe Bank of his district a loan at not more than six per cent\r\ninterest. The Bank authorizes loans for the purchase or improvement of\r\nland, for the purchase of live stock, and for the erection of farm\r\nbuildings. Loans must be secured by first mortgages not exceeding in\r\namount fifty per cent of the assessed value of the land and twenty per\r\ncent of the value of the improvements thereon pledged as security.\r\nLoans may run from five to forty years, and provision is made for the\r\ngradual payment, in small sums, of both principal and interest.\r\n\r\n300. MARKETING NEEDS OF THE FARMER.--A problem vitally affecting not\r\nonly the farmer but the urban consumer as well, has to do with the\r\nmarketing of farm produce. The price of farm produce often doubles or\r\ntrebles between the farm and the urban kitchen. This is largely\r\nbecause of a cumbersome marketing system and an overabundance of\r\nmiddlemen. Often the farmer gets entirely too little for his produce,\r\nwhile the city housewife pays too much for it. If the farmer is to\r\nsecure a larger return for his labor, and if the cost of foodstuffs in\r\ncities is to be reduced, we must devise more efficient methods of\r\nmarketing farm produce.\r\n\r\nThere is a general agreement among experts that in the marketing of\r\nfarm produce there ought to be some method of securing the co÷peration\r\nof farmer, urban consumer, and government. The further improvement of\r\ncountry roads, together with the development of trolleys, motor\r\ntrucking and other means of farm-to-city transport would reduce\r\nhaulage charges. The number of public markets in cities should be\r\nincreased, so that farm produce might be sold to consumers without the\r\ninterference of unnecessary middlemen. The grading and standardization\r\nof farm products would also facilitate sale by making it unnecessary\r\nfor prospective purchasers minutely to examine goods offered by the\r\nfarmers. In some cases farmers might advantageously sell their produce\r\ndirectly to urban consumers. The co÷perative marketing of farm\r\nproduce, also has the effect of reducing the number of middlemen.\r\n[Footnote: See Chapter XII, Section 116.]\r\n\r\nOne of the most important phases of marketing reform is the regulation\r\nof commission dealers. Many farmers commonly ship their produce to\r\ncommission dealers in the city. These dealers are supposed to sell\r\nthis produce and to return to the farmer the money thus secured, minus\r\na small commission. In many instances these middlemen return to the\r\nfarmer smaller sums than market conditions entitle the farmer to. At\r\nthe same time, commission dealers often add an excessive amount to the\r\nprice which they in turn ask of retailers and consumers. In a few\r\nstates commission dealers handling farm produce must now be licensed.\r\nThey are obliged to keep records which will enable an inspector to\r\ntell whether or not they have made false returns to farmers concerning\r\nthe condition of goods on arrival, the time at which sold, and the\r\nprice secured. A dealer convicted of dishonest methods loses his\r\nlicense. The future should see an extension of this licensing system.\r\n\r\n301. OTHER ECONOMIC NEEDS OF THE FARMER.--The economic position of the\r\nfarmer has been materially strengthened within the last forty years,\r\nyet much remains to be done before farming may be considered an\r\naltogether satisfactory and attractive occupation. Tenancy in rural\r\ndistricts needs to be studied carefully. Tenancy is not necessarily an\r\nevil, especially where it is a step toward ownership, but its rapid\r\nincrease in this country has caused many serious problems to arise.\r\nFrom both the economic and the social point of view it is desirable\r\nthat farmers own their land. Tenants have no permanent interest in the\r\nupkeep of the farm or in the rural community. Where tenancy is\r\nwidespread, land and buildings deteriorate, and the development of\r\nrural institutions is slow.\r\n\r\nMachinery is shortening the hours of labor for the farmer, and\r\nscientific farming is increasing his efficiency; nevertheless, in most\r\nsections of the country rural life still means long hours of hard\r\nlabor for small returns. Many farmers still work ten hours a day in\r\nwinter, twelve in summer, and from thirteen to fifteen in the harvest\r\nseason. Despite this sustained effort, the perishable character of his\r\nproduct, the uncertainty of weather conditions, and his dependence\r\nupon commission dealers, too often jeopardize the returns to the\r\nfarmer.\r\n\r\n302. RURAL HEALTH.--We have noticed that in some cases people have\r\nmoved to the city because in the country doctors tend to be both\r\nscarce and poorly trained, while frequently hospitals are\r\ninaccessible.\r\n\r\nRecently a number of influences are counteracting this relative\r\nbackwardness. The isolation of the rural dweller is disappearing\r\nbefore the automobile and the telephone. In many sections able doctors\r\nare increasingly plentiful. In most rural districts which are near\r\nlarge cities, there is now an efficient system of visiting nurses,\r\nfree clinics, and health bulletins. Health campaigns are spreading the\r\nfundamental principles of sanitation into many of the outlying\r\ndistricts also.\r\n\r\nBut these measures, while helpful, are only a beginning. In the more\r\nisolated rural sections especially, ignorance of sanitary methods is\r\nstill a serious evil. Many rural dwellers still rely upon traditional\r\nbut ineffective remedies for common complaints. Quacks having nostrums\r\nand injurious patent medicines to sell often prey upon rural\r\ncommunities in which there is no adequate provision for doctors,\r\nnurses, and hospitals. Rural diet is often so heavy as to encourage\r\nstomach disorders. Farmhouses are in many cases poorly ventilated in\r\nsummer and overheated in winter. Stables and stock pens are invariably\r\nso close to the farmhouse as to render difficult the protection of the\r\ndwelling against flies and mosquitoes.\r\n\r\n303. THE RURAL SCHOOL.--The chief educational institution in rural\r\ndistricts has long been the small district school, inadequately\r\nsupported and often inefficiently conducted.\r\n\r\nBut recently rural education has shown many signs of improvement. In\r\nmost sections of the country the development of farm machinery has so\r\nreduced the amount of manual labor on the farm that rural children are\r\nenabled to remain in school for a longer period than formerly. The\r\ndistrict school is in many cases being supplanted by the consolidated\r\nschool. Under the consolidation plan, a single large and well-equipped\r\nschool-house takes the place of a number of separate, small schools,\r\nindifferently equipped. When consolidation is accompanied by improved\r\nmeans of transporting children to school, the advantages of the plan\r\nare numerous. Because consolidation is a more economical arrangement\r\nthan the old district plan, it allows larger salaries to be offered.\r\nThis in turn allows the rural school to secure a higher grade of\r\nteacher. The trained educator is also attracted by the fact that the\r\nconsolidation of rural schools allows curricula to be standardized and\r\nenlarged. Scientific agriculture and allied subjects are slowly\r\nfinding their way into the rural grade school. The rural high school\r\nis beginning to appear.\r\n\r\nIn some sections of the country, on the other hand, the rural school\r\nis still in an unsatisfactory condition. In a number of states the\r\nrural school needs a more intelligent and consistent support from the\r\ntaxpayers, in order that better teachers, more and better\r\nschoolhouses, and better working equipment may be provided. In many\r\nsections of the country there is very little understanding of the\r\nadvantages of school consolidation and the necessity of more adequate\r\nrural education. It is desirable that rural schools be more closely\r\ncorrelated with the admirable work being done by experiment stations\r\nand agricultural colleges. The agricultural press might well co÷perate\r\nwith the rural schools in attacking the problems of country life.\r\nWithout doubt the rural school curriculum should place more emphasis\r\nupon practical agriculture and other subjects which will demonstrate\r\nthe dignity and attractiveness of rural life. Finally, it is desirable\r\nthat an increasing use be made of the schoolhouse as a social center.\r\n\r\n304. THE RURAL CHURCH.--The rural church, though an older institution\r\nthan the rural school, is advancing less rapidly. In many sections the\r\ncityward drift has drained the able ministers to the city, leaving\r\ninferior men to carry on the work of the rural church. Other rural\r\nsections have never had the benefit of an able clergy. In every part\r\nof the country it often happens that country ministers are not only\r\ninadequately trained, but are uninterested in rural problems.\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest needs of the American farming community,\r\ntherefore, is for a vitalized church. In many places rural districts\r\nare overchurched, and there is great need of some such consolidation\r\nas has been developed among rural schools. This development would so\r\ndecrease the number of ministers needed that higher salaries could be\r\noffered. This, in turn, would attract more highly trained ministers to\r\nthe country. It is also desirable that rural ministers be trained to a\r\nkeener appreciation of the economic and social problems of the\r\ncountry, with a view to making religion a practical help in solving\r\nthe problems of everyday life. An efficient and vitalized church could\r\nadvantageously be used as a focal point for the development of every\r\nphase of rural community life.\r\n\r\n305. ISOLATION THE MENACE OF RURAL LIFE.--Isolation may be said to be\r\nthe menace of rural life, as congestion is the menace of urban life.\r\nIn many out-of-the-way rural districts isolation has resulted in moral\r\ninertia and intellectual dullness. Isolation has weighed particularly\r\nhard upon the farmer's wife. Often she is called upon, not only to\r\nrear a large family, but to cook and keep house for hired men, raise\r\npoultry and garden stuff, and even to help in the fields during the\r\nharvest season. In spite of this deadening routine, she has had fewer\r\nchances than the farmer to go to town, to meet people, or otherwise to\r\nsecure a share of social life.\r\n\r\n306. COMMUNITY SPIRIT IN THE COUNTRY.--In view of the injurious\r\neffects of rural isolation, it is encouraging to note the beginnings\r\nof a genuine community spirit in country districts. To a considerable\r\nextent this development is the result of improved means of\r\ntransportation and communication. The coming of the automobile, the\r\ntelephone, and the trolley, the development of the rural free\r\ndelivery, the parcel post, and the agricultural press,--all these\r\nfactors have been important. The farmer has been enabled to share more\r\nand more in the benefits of city life without leaving the farm. Even\r\nmore important, perhaps, improved methods of transportation and\r\ncommunication have stimulated social intercourse among farmers.\r\nCo÷peration in church and school work has been encouraged. Clubs and\r\ncommunity centers are more practicable where farmers make use of the\r\nautomobile and the telephone. The fair and the festival are also\r\nproving to be admirable methods of developing the co÷perative spirit\r\nin rural life.\r\n\r\nThe growing realization among students of rural life that a strong and\r\nconstructive community spirit is not only desirable but possible, is\r\nencouraging an interest in rural problems. The development of such a\r\nspirit must ultimately stimulate a healthy social life in the country,\r\nwith a resultant increase in health and prosperity, not only for the\r\nfarmer but for the nation as a whole.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS ON THE TEXT\r\n\r\n1.

THE MEANING OF EDUCATION.--A half century ago education might\r\nhave been defined as the process of acquiring certain types of book\r\nknowledge which contributed to the culture of the individual. More\r\nrecently the concept of education has been broadened and deepened.\r\nPresent-day education aims not only to add to the culture of the\r\nindividual, but to vitalize the community as well. Education is no\r\nlonger limited to the schoolroom, but includes all agencies and\r\nactivities which in any way help toward a fuller and more responsible\r\ncitizenship. Education is no longer confined to infancy and youth, but\r\nis a life-long process. Our educational system no longer assumes that\r\nthe needs and capacities of all pupils are similar, but attempts so to\r\ndiversify training that each individual will be enabled to develop his\r\npeculiar powers and to contribute to American life in the manner best\r\nsuited to his individual ability. Taken in its widest sense, education\r\nhas seven great objectives. These are health, command of fundamental\r\nprocesses (such as reading, writing, and arithmetic), worthy home-\r\nmembership, vocation, citizenship, worthy use of leisure, and ethical\r\ncharacter. [Footnote: These objectives have been formulated by the\r\nNational Commission on the Reorganization of Secondary Education.]\r\n\r\n308. EDUCATION AND DEMOCRACY.--Two centuries ago the education of the\r\nmasses was politically a matter of small concern, for most governments\r\nwere conducted by a narrowly restricted class. But in a democracy\r\neducation is fundamental. The idea that the masses should govern\r\nthemselves is an appealing one, but before self-government is safe a\r\ncomprehensive educational system must have made substantial inroads\r\nupon illiteracy and ignorance. Not only must the citizen of a\r\ndemocracy be individually capable, but his capacity to co÷perate with\r\nhis fellows must be large. Under an undemocratic government the people\r\nrely upon their rulers; in a democracy they must rely upon their own\r\njoint efforts. From both an individual and a social standpoint,\r\ntherefore, democracy demands more of its educational system than does\r\nany other form of government.\r\n\r\n309. DEVELOPMENT OF EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES.--Education was an\r\nimportant concern in most of the American colonies, and especially so\r\nin New England. After 1800 the common school system was extended\r\nrapidly, the district school passing westward with the pioneer\r\nmovement. Educational facilities continued to expand and to diversify\r\nuntil at the end of the Civil War period there were more than seven\r\nmillion children in the elementary schools of this country. The period\r\nfollowing the Civil War also saw the beginnings of the high school, a\r\ncharacteristic American educational institution which arose to take\r\nthe place of the older Latin grammar schools and the private\r\nacademies. Normal schools for the training of teachers, and colleges\r\nand universities for higher education, developed rapidly after 1880.\r\nToday there are more than three quarters of a million teachers in the\r\nUnited States, instructing more than 25,000,000 students in\r\ninstitutions ranging from kindergarten and elementary schools to\r\ncolleges and universities.\r\n\r\n310. MERITS OF OUR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM.--The merits of our educational\r\nsystem are of great significance. We are definitely committed to the\r\nideal of an educated citizenry. It has been the policy of the several\r\nstates to establish and maintain free public schools. School\r\nattendance is compulsory, on full or part time, for children up to a\r\ncertain age, the age varying from state to state. No public school is\r\nsectarian, the freedom of religious thought and action guaranteed by\r\nthe Federal Constitution having been continued into our public school\r\nsystem. The public schools stimulate democratic tendencies by bringing\r\ntogether large masses of children from all walks of life. Our school\r\nsystem likewise has an Americanizing influence upon a large number of\r\nforeigners because their children study in our public schools and then\r\ncarry into their homes the influence of the school. Within the last\r\nquarter of a century our schools have greatly extended their\r\nfunctions, becoming, in many cases, genuine community centers.\r\n\r\n311. FINANCIANG THE SCHOOLS.--The substantial advances made in\r\nAmerican education during the last century are a cause for\r\ncongratulation. At the same time, our standards of education are\r\nrising so rapidly that a number of educational problems are becoming\r\nacute.\r\n\r\nAn important problem has to do with the financial support of our\r\nrapidly expanding school system. In many states the schools are\r\ninadequately supported by the tax payers. In some of these states the\r\npublic schools are not readily accessible to large numbers of\r\nchildren, while in the schools that are accessible the equipment is\r\noften inadequate to the demands made upon it. In many states teachers\r\nstill receive insufficient salaries.\r\n\r\nOur schools ought not to suffer from lack of funds. Ours is the\r\nrichest country in the world, and our school system is one of the most\r\nvital and fundamental of our institutions. Often the failure of\r\ntaxpayers properly to support the schools is due to either or both of\r\nthe following causes: First, failure to appreciate the importance of\r\neducation; second, the lack of accessible wealth as a basis of\r\ntaxation. The first objection must be met by so perfecting our\r\neducational system that taxpayers will be convinced that money\r\ninvested in schools means large profits in the form of a more\r\nefficient and prosperous citizenship. The second objection calls for\r\nthe reform of our taxation system.\r\n\r\n312. CONTROL OF EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES.--In the United States\r\neducation is a state rather than a national function. There is no\r\nFederal administration of schools, each state having its independent\r\nsystem. Each state has a system of elementary education, and nearly\r\nevery state has a secondary or high school system. Nearly all of the\r\nstates also have state universities in which instruction is either\r\nfree or is available at a nominal charge. The public schools are\r\nsupported chiefly by local taxes and are controlled mainly by the\r\nlocal authorities. In most states local outlays are supplemented, to a\r\ngreater or less degree, by state contributions. State support is\r\nalmost always accompanied by a measure of state control, though the\r\nextent of this control varies widely among the several states.\r\n\r\n313. THE QUESTION OF UNIFORM STANDARDS.--To what extent should there\r\nbe uniformity within our school system? We have no national system of\r\neducation, and the lack of co÷rdination between the educational\r\nsystems of the several states has many undesirable features.\r\nEducational standards vary widely from state to state, and often from\r\ncounty to county within the same state. The confusion growing out of\r\nthis situation has given rise to the demand for the systematization or\r\nstandardization of our school facilities.\r\n\r\nThe question is a difficult one. Most authorities believe that\r\neducation ought not to be centralized under the Federal government,\r\nbut ought, rather, to remain a state function. But even though it is\r\nnot desirable to allow the Federal government to take over the chief\r\neducational powers of the state, it is believed by many that some\r\nnational agency might render valuable service in co÷rdinating the\r\neducational programs of the several states. At present many educators\r\nfeel that the Federal government should insist upon minimum standards\r\nin education in the various states of the Union.\r\n\r\nStandardization within each state is considered desirable by most\r\nauthorities. All of the educational facilities of a given commonwealth\r\nprobably ought to be co÷rdinated under some supervising state agency.\r\nThe administrative ideal in state education is so to systematize the\r\nschools of the state that they will be bound together by a common\r\npurpose, guided by the same set of established principles, and\r\ndirected toward the same social ends.\r\n\r\n314. SCHOOL ATTENDANCE.--A serious defect of our educational system\r\narises in connection with school attendance. In many states the school\r\nattendance laws are laxly enforced. It is claimed that at no one time\r\nis more than three fourths of our school population enrolled in the\r\nschools. Of those who do comply with the school attendance laws, there\r\nis a considerable percentage which cannot acquire an adequate\r\neducation within the limits of the compulsory school period. Only\r\nabout one third of the pupils who enter the first year of the\r\nelementary school reach the four-year high school, and only about one\r\nin nine is graduated. Of those who enter high school, about one third\r\nleave before the beginning of the second year, about one half are gone\r\nbefore the beginning of the third year, and fewer than one third are\r\ngraduated.\r\n\r\nWithin the last decade there has been a marked tendency among the\r\nseveral states to enforce school attendance laws more strictly. No\r\nless encouraging is the growing belief among educators that the school\r\nattendance period ought so to be adjusted that every child will be\r\nguaranteed the working essentials of an education. There is grave\r\ndoubt as to the wisdom of raising the minimum age at which children\r\nmay withdraw from school, but at least greater efforts ought to be\r\nmade to keep children in school at least for part-time schooling\r\nbeyond the present compulsory period. As will be pointed out\r\npresently, much is already being done in this direction.\r\n\r\n315. EDUCATION AS PREPARATION FOR DAILIY LIFE.--It is sometimes said\r\nthat our educational system neglects practical activities for subjects\r\nthat have no immediate connection with the problems of daily life.\r\nMany citizens have thoughtlessly condemned the whole program of\r\neducation because they have observed that particular schools have\r\nallowed pupils to go forth with a fund of miscellaneous knowledge\r\nwhich neither helps them to get a better living, nor aids them in\r\nperforming the duties of citizenship. On the basis of these and allied\r\nconsiderations, there is a growing demand that education be made more\r\n\"practical.\"\r\n\r\nThere is much to be said for and against this attitude. Some\r\nenthusiasts are apparently carrying the demand for \"practical\"\r\neducation too far. The growing importance in our industrial life of\r\nefficiency and practical training should not blind us to the fact that\r\neducation is cultural as well as occupational or vocational. The\r\neducation of an individual is not estimated alone by the degree to\r\nwhich he succeeds in practical affairs, but as well by the extent to\r\nwhich he shows evidence of training in the appreciation of moral,\r\nartistic, and literary values. It is sometimes difficult to see that\r\nthe study of literature, ancient languages, and similar subjects is\r\npreparation for life, and yet wise training in these fields may prove\r\nas important as studies which aid more directly and immediately in\r\ngetting a living.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, our educational system must take note of the\r\ngrowing importance of industrial activities. Since education is\r\npreparation for life, the school must accommodate itself to the\r\nchanges which are now taking place in our economic and social\r\norganization. As modern society becomes more complex, more tinged with\r\nindustrial elements, more a matter of co÷peration and interdependence,\r\neducation must become more highly evolved, more attentive to\r\nvocational needs, and more emphatic in the stress which it lays upon\r\nthe actual duties of citizenship.\r\n\r\nThe more complex the needs of daily life, therefore, the greater the\r\nnecessity of shifting emphasis in education. But in thus shifting the\r\nemphasis in education we must be careful not to disturb the balance\r\nbetween cultural and \"practical\" subjects. To discriminate between\r\nwhat should be taught and what should be omitted from the curriculum,\r\nto retain the finest elements of our cultural studies, but at the same\r\ntime to fit our citizens to meet the demands of office, shop, and\r\nfactory,--these are the tasks of the educator.\r\n\r\n316. VOCATIONAL EDUCATION.--Vocational training is one of the most\r\nsignificant developments in modern education. This type of education\r\nis designed to train the young person to earn a good living in that\r\nbranch of work for which he seems best fitted. Some of the supporters\r\nof vocational education believe that this specialized form of training\r\nought to be commenced very early and in connection with the regular\r\ncurriculum. Others think that vocational education should not be\r\nattempted until the child has been given enough generalized training\r\nto enable him properly to perform the fundamental duties of\r\ncitizenship.\r\n\r\nBut whatever its relation to the curriculum, vocational education is\r\nof great significance. If combined with vocational guidance it not\r\nonly prevents the boy or girl from aimlessly drifting into an\r\nunskilled occupation, but it singles out for special attention\r\nchildren who show special aptitude for particular trades and\r\nprofessions. Vocational education for the blind, the deaf, the\r\ncrippled, and the otherwise disabled is social service of the finest\r\nand most constructive type.\r\n\r\n317. FEDERAL ENCOURAGEMENT OF VOCATIONAL EDUCATION.--In February,\r\n1917, Congress passed the Smith-Hughes Act, establishing a Federal\r\nBoard for Vocational Education. This board promotes vocational\r\neducation in co÷peration with the several states, and administers the\r\nFederal aid granted to the states under the Act. Each state accepting\r\nthe provisions of the Act must provide a state board to control a\r\nsystem of vocational schools. Evening, part-time, and continuation\r\nschools offer instruction in agriculture, industry, commerce,\r\ntransportation, and the professions. Each state must also agree to\r\nappropriate, either through the state or locally, an amount of money\r\nfor teachers' salaries, equivalent to the sum received from the\r\nFederal board. Such states must also agree to provide proper buildings\r\nand meet the running expenses of the system. In the first year under\r\nthis Act, the Federal appropriations amounted to more than a million\r\nand a half dollars. This sum is to be increased annually until the\r\nyear 1925-1926, when the states will receive $7,000,000 from the\r\nFederal government in support of vocational education.\r\n\r\n318. LIMITATIONS OF THE CONVENTIONAL SCHOOL TERM.--A few decades ago,\r\nthe typical school in an American city offered instruction to certain\r\nclasses of young people between nine o'clock in the morning and three\r\nor four o'clock in the afternoon, for from 150 to 180 days a year.\r\nDuring the rest of the time the schoolhouse was idle.\r\n\r\nThis policy greatly restricted the education of important groups of\r\npeople. Adult immigrants were barred from the elementary public\r\nschools. Persons desiring educational guidance in special fields often\r\nfound that the school offered them no help. Cripples, men and women\r\nemployed in the daytime, and other individuals who found it impossible\r\nor inconvenient to attend school during the conventional time limits,\r\nwere restricted in educational opportunity. Many boys and girls who\r\ndrop out of school because of the necessity of going to work, do so\r\nbefore their education has been completed. For most of these classes,\r\nthe inability to take advantage of the regular school term has meant\r\nthe denial of adequate education.\r\n\r\n319. WIDER USE OF THE SCHOOL PLANT.--Recently the \"wider use of the\r\nschool plant\" movement is helping these classes to secure or continue\r\ntheir education. For unassimilated immigrants, day and evening courses\r\nin citizenship are now provided in many cities and towns. In many\r\ncities vacation schools have been established for the convenience of\r\nchildren who have failed in their studies, or who are able and willing\r\nto make unusual progress in various subjects. For those who work by\r\nday there is often a chance to go to school by night. For those who\r\nfind it inexpedient to leave their homes, there are, in many places,\r\ntravelling libraries and correspondence courses. In some western\r\nstates the farmer now has an opportunity of taking extension courses\r\nfrom the State university during those seasons in which his work is\r\nlightest. For pupils who are under the necessity of partially or\r\nentirely supporting themselves, some cities now have part-time or all-\r\naround-the-year schools.\r\n\r\n320. THE SCHOOL AS A SOCIAL CENTER.--Closely associated with the\r\nmovement to extend school facilities to those who would ordinarily be\r\ndebarred from them, is the movement toward making the school a social\r\ncenter. Many city and some rural schools now provide free to the\r\ngeneral public lectures on science, art, literature, and business.\r\nMoving pictures, dramatics, and other forms of entertainment are\r\nbecoming a regular feature of this type of school work. In many\r\nschools the gymnasiums are available to the public under reasonable\r\nrestrictions. Folk singing and dancing are being encouraged in\r\nnumerous schools. Schoolrooms devoted by day to regular school courses\r\nare in many places being used during the evening for the discussion of\r\npublic questions. In these and other ways the school is becoming a\r\ncenter of life for the community. It is extending into the homes of\r\nthe people and is becoming the instrument of the community rather than\r\nof a particular group.\r\n\r\n321. EDUCATION AND SOCIAL PROGRESS.--We may sum up the problems so far\r\ndiscussed in this text by noting that their solution calls for three\r\ndifferent types of treatment.\r\n\r\nFirst, we must strike at the root of poverty by giving every\r\nindividual just what he earns, by making it possible for every\r\nindividual to earn enough to support himself and his family decently,\r\nand by teaching him to spend his income wisely and economically.\r\n\r\nSecond, wise and careful laws must be passed for the purpose of\r\ncorrecting and lessening the social defects of American democracy.\r\n\r\nThird, education must be relied upon to render the individual able and\r\nwilling to do his duty toward himself and his country. The boys and\r\ngirls of to-day are the voters and home-makers of to-morrow, and the\r\nresponsibility of preparing those boys and girls for the efficient\r\nconduct of community life rests almost entirely upon the school. Thus\r\neducation is one of the most basic factors in social progress. Neither\r\na reorganized economic system, nor the most carefully drawn laws on\r\nsocial questions will solve the problems of American democracy until\r\nthe individual citizen is trained to a proper appreciation of his\r\nresponsibilities toward himself and toward his country.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS ON THE TEXT\r\n\r\n1.

SOME ECONOMIC FUNCTIONS OF GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nPUBLIC INTEREST IN BUSINESS: REGULATION\r\n\r\n\r\n322. NECESSITY OF PUBLIC INTEREST IN BUSINESS.--Although individuals\r\ncarry on business primarily for their own ends, the economic\r\nactivities of men affect not only themselves, but the community as\r\nwell. If every individual voluntarily confined his attention to those\r\nforms of business which strengthened the community as well as adding\r\nto his own prosperity, there would be little need for laws regulating\r\nthe conduct of business. But because experience has shown that some\r\npersons will seek to benefit themselves in ways that react to the\r\ninjury of the community, it becomes necessary for law to adjust\r\nprivate and public interests. A community cannot remain indifferent to\r\nthe economic activities of its citizens. Public interest in business\r\nis a fundamental necessity, if the community is to be safeguarded\r\nagainst the abuses of free enterprise.\r\n\r\n323. NATURE OF PUBLIC INTEREST IN BUSINESS.--In general, the object of\r\nlaws regulating business is either to encourage helpful business\r\nmethods, or to discourage harmful business methods. A good deal of\r\nlegislation has been designed positively to encourage helpful business\r\nmethods, yet it remains true that the most significant of our\r\nindustrial laws have been aimed primarily at the discouragement of\r\nharmful business. A fundamental American ideal is to insure to the\r\nindividual as much freedom of action as is consistent with the public\r\ninterest. Thus we believe that if harmful business is controlled or\r\nsuppressed, private initiative may be trusted to develop helpful\r\nbusiness methods, without the aid of fostering legislation. In this\r\nand the following chapter, therefore, we may confine our attention to\r\nlegislation designed to suppress harmful business methods.\r\n\r\n324. THE NATURE OF MONOPOLY.--We may begin the discussion by inquiring\r\ninto the nature and significance of monopoly.\r\n\r\nUnder openly competitive conditions the free play of supply and demand\r\nbetween a number of producers and a number of prospective consumers\r\nfixes the price of a commodity. In such cases consumers are protected\r\nagainst exorbitant prices by the fact that rival producers will\r\nunderbid each other in the effort to sell their goods.\r\n\r\nBut if the supply of a good, say wheat, is not in the hands of several\r\nrival producers, but is under the control of a unified group of\r\npersons, competition between the owners of the wheat is suppressed\r\nsufficiently to enable this unified group more nearly to dictate the\r\nprice for which wheat shall sell. In such a case a monopoly is said to\r\nexist. Complete control of the supply of a commodity is rare, even for\r\nshort periods, but modern business offers many instances of\r\nenterprises which are more or less monopolistic in character.\r\n\r\nThe essential danger of monopoly is that those who have secured\r\ncontrol of the available supply of a commodity will use that control\r\nto benefit themselves at the expense of the public. By combining their\r\nindividual businesses, producers who were formerly rivals may secure\r\nthe chief advantage of large-scale management. That is to say, the\r\ncost of production per unit may be decreased, because several combined\r\nplants might be operated more economically than several independent\r\nconcerns. If the cost of production _is_ decreased the combining\r\nproducers can afford to lower the price of their product. But if they\r\nare practically in control of the entire supply, they will not lower\r\nthe price unless it serves their interests to do so. Indeed it is more\r\nlikely that they will take advantage of their monopoly to raise the\r\nprice.\r\n\r\n325. TYPES OF MONOPOLY.--Monopolies are variously classified, but for\r\nour purpose they may be called either _natural_ or _unnatural_.\r\n\r\nA _natural_ monopoly may exist where, by the very nature of the\r\nbusiness, competition is either impossible or socially undesirable.\r\nExamples of this type of monopoly are gas and water works, street\r\nrailways, steam railways, and similar industries. These will be\r\ndiscussed in the next chapter.\r\n\r\nWhere an _unnatural_ monopoly exists, it is not because the essential\r\ncharacter of the business renders it unfit for the competitive system,\r\nbut because competition has been artificially suppressed. The\r\ntraditional example of an unnatural monopoly is that form of large-\r\nscale combination which is popularly known as a trust.\r\n\r\n326. ORIGIN OF THE TRUST.--After the Civil War, rivalry in many\r\nindustries was so intense as to lead to \"cutthroat\" competition and a\r\nconsequent reduction in profits. For the purpose of securing the\r\nadvantages of monopoly, many previously competing businesses combined.\r\nIn 1882 John D. Rockefeller organized the Standard Oil Company, the\r\nfirst trust in this country. The plan drawn up by Mr. Rockefeller\r\nprovided that the owners of a number of oil refineries should place\r\ntheir stock in the hands of a board of trustees. In exchange for this\r\nstock, the owners received trust certificates on which they were paid\r\ndividends. Having control of the stock, the trustees were enabled to\r\nmanage the combining corporations as one concern, thus maintaining a\r\nunified control over supply, and opening the way to monopoly profits.\r\n\r\n327. PRESENT MEANING OF THE TERM \"TRUST.\"--The plan initiated by Mr.\r\nRockefeller was so successful that other groups of industries adopted\r\nit. After 1890 the original trust device was forbidden by statute, and\r\nthe _trust proper_ declined in importance. But there continued to be a\r\nlarge number of industrial combinations which, under slightly\r\ndifferent forms, have secured all of the advantages of the original\r\ntrust. In some cases previously competing corporations have actually\r\namalgamated; in still other cases, combining concerns have secured the\r\nadvantages of monopoly by forming a holding company. A holding company\r\nis a corporation which is created for the express purpose of \"holding\"\r\nor controlling stock in several other corporations. This the holding\r\ncompany does by buying a sufficient amount of the stock of the\r\ncombining concerns to insure unity of management and control. Since\r\nthe holding company and similar devices secure the chief advantages of\r\nthe original trust, the word \"trust\" is now used to designate any\r\nclosely knit combination which has monopolistic advantages.\r\n\r\n328. GROWTH OF THE TRUST MOVEMENT.--The trust movement developed\r\nrapidly after 1882. There were important combinations in the oil, tin,\r\nsugar, steel, tobacco, paper, and other industries. By 1898 there had\r\nbeen formed some eighty trusts, with a total capitalization of about\r\n$1,000,000,000. At the beginning of 1904 the number of trusts exceeded\r\nthree hundred, while their combined capital totaled more than\r\n$5,000,000,000. The largest single trust was the United States Steel\r\nCorporation, which was capitalized at almost a billion and a half\r\ndollars. At the beginning of 1911, in which year the Supreme Court of\r\nthe United States ordered two important trusts to dissolve, the\r\ncombined capital of the trusts was probably in excess of\r\n$6,000,000,000.\r\n\r\n329. ABUSE OF POWER BY THE TRUSTS.--Trusts have often abused their\r\nmonopolistic powers. They have often used their wealth to corrupt\r\nlegislatures and to attempt to influence even the courts, in the\r\neffort to prevent laws and court decisions from restricting their\r\nmonopoly. The corruption of railway corporations and of political\r\nparties has been partly due to the evil influence of the trusts.\r\nTrusts have often crushed out independent concerns that endeavored to\r\ncompete with them. This has been accomplished, partly by inducing\r\nrailroads to discriminate against independent concerns and in favor of\r\nthe trusts, partly by cutting prices in competitive markets until\r\nindependent concerns were crushed out, and partly by the use of\r\nbribes, threats, and other unfair methods. After competition had been\r\nsuppressed, the trusts took advantage of their monopoly to raise\r\nprices on their products, thus imposing a heavy burden upon the\r\npublic.\r\n\r\n330. THE SHERMAN ANTI-TRUST ACT. (1890.)--During the eighties a number\r\nof states attempted to control the trust movement. But the Federal\r\ngovernment has exclusive jurisdiction over interstate business, and\r\nfor this reason the action of the states was limited to the control of\r\nthe relatively unimportant trust business lying entirely within their\r\nrespective borders. The fact that an increasing proportion of trust\r\nbusiness was interstate in character stimulated interest in Federal\r\nanti-trust legislation, and in 1890 the Sherman Anti-trust Act was\r\npassed. This Act declared illegal \"every contract, combination in the\r\nform of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or\r\ncommerce among the several States, or with foreign nations.\"\r\n\r\n331. FAILURE OF THE SHERMAN ACT.--For more than twenty years after its\r\npassage, the Sherman Act did little to curb the growth of the trusts,\r\nindeed, the most marked tendency toward trust formation occurred\r\n_after_ 1890. Numerous suits were brought under the Act, but the\r\nlukewarm attitude of the courts rendered difficult the administration\r\nof the law. After 1911 the courts held that the restraint of trade was\r\nillegal if \"unreasonable,\" but few juries could be found that could\r\nagree upon the difference between a \"reasonable\" and an \"unreasonable\"\r\nrestraint of trade. Lastly, combinations which had been organized\r\nunder the original trust plan were not disheartened by court decrees\r\nordering them to dissolve, but reorganized under some device which was\r\npractically as effective as the trust plan, but which did not\r\ntechnically violate the Sherman act.\r\n\r\n332. FURTHER LEGISLATION IN 1914.--Finally in 1911 the government\r\nsucceeded in dissolving the Standard Oil Company and the American\r\nTobacco Company, two of the largest trusts in the country. This\r\nsuccess encouraged the Department of Justice to institute other suits,\r\nand stimulated such general interest in the trust problem that in 1914\r\nCongress passed two new Anti-trust Acts. These were the Clayton Act\r\nand the Federal Trade Commission Act. The general effect of these laws\r\nwas to strengthen anti-trust legislation by correcting some of the\r\nfundamental defects of the Sherman Act, and by still further extending\r\nthe power of the Federal government over monopolistic combinations.\r\n\r\n333. The Clayton Act of 1914.--The Clayton Act forbids \"unjustifiable\r\ndiscriminations in the prices charged to different persons,\" and also\r\nprohibits the lease or sale of goods made with the understanding that\r\nthe lessee or purchaser shall not patronize competing concerns. The\r\nAct specifies a number of other practices which constitute\r\nunreasonable restraints of trade. Somewhat complicated limitations are\r\nimposed upon interlocking directorates, by which is meant the practice\r\nof individuals being on the board of directors of different\r\ncorporations. [FOOTNOTE: The danger of the interlocking directorate,\r\nof course, is that individuals who are directors in two or more\r\ncorporations may attempt to suppress competition between those\r\ncorporations. This may lead to monopoly.] The Act likewise forbids the\r\nacquisition by one corporation of stock in another corporation when\r\nthe effect may be \"to substantially lessen competition\" between such\r\ncorporations, or \"to tend to create a monopoly.\"\r\n\r\n334. THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION ACT OF 1914.--The second of the two\r\nActs of 1914 created a Federal Trade Commission of five members,\r\nappointed by the President. The Commission has the power to require\r\nannual or special reports from interstate corporations in such form\r\nand relating to such matters as it may prescribe. At the request of\r\nthe Attorney General, the Commission must investigate and report upon\r\nany corporation alleged to be violating the anti-trust laws. The most\r\nimportant power of the Commission is undoubtedly that of issuing\r\norders restraining the use of \"unfair methods of competition in\r\ncommerce.\" This clause aims at prevention rather than at punishment,\r\nand if its power is wisely used it will check monopoly in the early\r\nstages. Most authorities claim that in this regard the work of the\r\nCommission has already proved definitely helpful.\r\n\r\n335. THE OUTLOOK.--Since 1911, and especially since the passage of the\r\ntwo Acts of 1914, the trust situation has materially improved. The\r\nvague and wholly inadequate powers of the old Sherman Act have been\r\nclarified and supplemented by the more specific provisions of the\r\nClayton and Federal Trade Commission Acts. Fairly adequate machinery\r\nfor the investigation and prosecution of trusts is now provided. The\r\npresent laws cover not only combinations making use of the old trust\r\ndevice, but also combinations employing other methods of exercising\r\nmonopoly control. The Federal Trade Commission Act provides for\r\npublicity, so that public opinion may have a chance to enforce the\r\nprinciple of fair play and open competition in business. The trust\r\nproblem in the United States is not yet solved, but the careful\r\ncontrol which we are now exercising over this type of organization\r\njustifies the belief that the trust evil will become less important as\r\ntime goes on.\r\n\r\n336. THE TRUST PROBLEM OF THE FUTURE. In connection with the matter of\r\nmaking anti-trust legislation more effective, a new and pressing\r\nproblem is arising. This has to do with the necessity of\r\ndistinguishing, first, between the legitimate and the illegitimate\r\npractices of trusts [Footnote: Large-scale combination or management\r\nallows important economies to be practiced. Plant can be used more\r\nadvantageously, supervision is less costly, supplies can be purchased\r\nin large quantities and hence more cheaply, etc. The securing of these\r\neconomies constitutes a legitimate feature of large-scale combination\r\nor management.]; and second, between combinations which are\r\nmonopolistic and combinations in which there is no element of\r\nmonopoly.\r\n\r\nWe are coming to realize a fact which in Europe has long been a matter\r\nof common knowledge, namely, that trusts are never wholly and\r\nunqualifiedly bad. The law should not aim to destroy trusts, but\r\nrather should attempt so to regulate their activities that their\r\neconomical features will be preserved while their harmful practices\r\nwill be suppressed. Laws should also recognize the fact that many\r\nlarge-scale combinations have in them no element of monopoly, and that\r\nsuch combinations should be exempted from anti-trust prosecution. In\r\ndrawing up anti-trust legislation, prohibitions and restrictions\r\nshould be as concise and as definite as possible, both in order to\r\nfacilitate the execution of the law, and in order to prevent hardships\r\nbeing worked upon combinations which have consistently observed the\r\nrules of fair play in competitive business.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS ON THE TEXT\r\n\r\n1.

BASIS OF NATURAL MONOPOLY.--The most important examples of\r\n_natural_ monopoly are found in those industries which are known as\r\npublic utilities. Public utilities include gas and electric light\r\nworks, waterworks, telephone and telegraph plants, and electric and\r\nsteam railways.\r\n\r\nThese industries are by their very nature unsuited to the competitive\r\nsystem. This is chiefly because they operate under the principle of\r\ndecreasing cost, that is to say, the greater the volume of business\r\nhandled by a single plant, the less the cost of production per unit.\r\nIn order to serve 100,000 customers with gas, for example, it may be\r\nnecessary to make an initial outlay of $90,000 in plant and supplies.\r\nWith this identical plant, however, the gas works could really\r\nmanufacture gas sufficient to serve more than 100,000. If, later, the\r\ncity grows and the number of customers using gas doubles, the gas\r\nworks, already having its basic plant, will not have to expend another\r\n$90,000, but only, say, an additional $30,000.\r\n\r\nThis principle has the double effect of virtually prohibiting\r\ncompetition and of encouraging combination. Since a street or a\r\nneighborhood can be served with water or gas more cheaply by a single\r\nplant than by several competing plants, competing plants tend to\r\ncombine in order to secure the economies resulting from decreasing\r\ncost and large-scale production. On the other hand, the cost of\r\nduplicating a set of water mains or a network of street car tracks is\r\nso prohibitive as to render competition undesirable, both from the\r\nstandpoint of the utility and from the standpoint of the public.\r\n\r\nThis natural tendency toward monopoly, together with the social\r\nimportance of public utilities, has given rise to a demand that\r\nbusinesses of this type be publicly owned. The problem of public\r\nownership may be considered under two heads: first, the municipal\r\nownership of local utilities; and, second, the national ownership of\r\nsteam railroads.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. MUNICIPAL OWNERSHIP\r\n\r\n338. REGULATION OF LOCAL UTILITIES.--In many American cities it was\r\nformerly the custom of the city council to confer valuable privileges\r\nupon public service corporations on terms that did not adequately\r\nsafeguard the public interest. In making such grants, called\r\nfranchises, city councils often permitted private corporations the\r\nfree use of the streets and other public property for long periods of\r\ntime or even in perpetuity.\r\n\r\nThe abuses growing out of the careless use of the franchise granting\r\npower have recently led to a more strict supervision of franchises to\r\npublic service corporations. In most cities, franchises are no longer\r\nperpetual, but are limited to a definite and rather short period, say\r\nfifty years. To an increasing extent, franchises are drawn up by\r\nexperts, so that the terms of the grant will safeguard the interests\r\nof the public. In many states there are now public service commissions\r\nthat have the power to regulate privately owned utilities. The chief\r\naim of such commissions is to keep informed as to the condition of the\r\nutilities, and to fix rates and charges which the commission considers\r\nfair and reasonable.\r\n\r\n339. ARGUMENTS FOR MUNICIPAL OWNERSHIP.--Those favoring municipal\r\nownership, as opposed to regulation, declare that the conditions\r\naffecting rates change so rapidly that no public service commission\r\ncan fix rates fairly or promptly. Public ownership would save the cost\r\nof regulation, in many cases a considerable item. It is maintained\r\nthat regulation is inevitably a failure, and that in view of the\r\nsocial importance of public utilities, ownership is a logical and\r\nnecessary step.\r\n\r\nImportant social gains are claimed for municipal ownership. It is said\r\nthat where the plan has been tried, it has promoted civic interest and\r\nhas enlisted a higher type of public official. If all utilities were\r\nmunicipally owned, state legislatures and city councils would no\r\nlonger be subjected to the danger of corruption by private\r\ncorporations seeking franchises. If utilities were owned by the\r\nmunicipality, it is claimed, service and social welfare rather than\r\nprofits would become the ideal. The public plant could afford to offer\r\nlower rates, because it would not be under the necessity of earning\r\nhigh profits. Finally, service could be extended into outlying or\r\nsparsely settled districts which are now neglected by privately owned\r\ncompanies because of the high expense and small profits that would\r\nresult from such extension.\r\n\r\n340. ARGUMENTS AGAINST MUNICIPAL OWNDERSHIP.--Other students of the\r\nproblem believe that public regulation of utilities is preferable to\r\nmunicipal ownership. Those holding this view maintain that on the\r\nwhole regulation has proved satisfactory, and that ownership is\r\ntherefore unnecessary.\r\n\r\nRather than improving the public service by enlisting a higher type of\r\npublic official, it is maintained, municipal ownership would increase\r\npolitical corruption by enlarging the number of positions which would\r\nbecome the spoils of the political party in power. The periodic\r\npolitical changes resulting from frequent elections in cities would\r\ndemoralize the administration of the utilities. Under our present\r\nsystem of government, municipal ownership means a lack of centralized\r\ncontrol, a factor which would lessen administrative responsibility and\r\nencourage inefficiency.\r\n\r\nThe opponents of municipal ownership also contend that the\r\ninefficiency resulting from this form of control would increase the\r\ncost of management. This increased cost would in turn necessitate\r\nhigher rates. Moreover, municipal ownership might increase enormously\r\nthe indebtedness of the municipality, since either private plants\r\nwould have to be purchased, or new plants erected at public expense.\r\n\r\n341. EXTENT OF MUNICIPAL OWNERSHIP.--Some cities have tried municipal\r\nownership and have abandoned the scheme as unworkable. In some\r\ninstances this failure has been due to the inherent difficulties of\r\nthe case, in other instances the inefficiency of the city\r\nadministration has prevented success. In still other cities ownership\r\nof various utilities has proved markedly successful.\r\n\r\nMost American cities now own their own waterworks, and about one third\r\nof them own their own gas or electric light plants. A few cities own\r\neither a part or the whole of their street railways. Municipal\r\nownership of public utilities is still in its infancy, but the\r\nmovement is growing.\r\n\r\n342. CONDITIONS OF MUNICIPAL OWNERSHIP.--Past experience indicates\r\nseveral mistakes to be avoided in any future consideration of the\r\nproblem of municipal ownership.\r\n\r\nThe terms upon which the city purchases a utility ought not to be so\r\nsevere as to discourage the future development of new utilities by\r\nprivate enterprise.\r\n\r\nPublic ownership is practicable only when the utility has passed the\r\nexperimental stage, for governmental agencies cannot effectively carry\r\non the experiments, nor assume the risks, so essential to the\r\ndevelopment of a new enterprise.\r\n\r\nAny discussion of public ownership ought to include a consideration of\r\nsocial and political factors, as well as matters which are strictly\r\neconomic.\r\n\r\nThe question of municipal ownership should be decided purely on the\r\nbasis of local conditions and for particular utilities. The successful\r\nownership of street railways in one city does not necessarily mean\r\nthat a second city may be equally successful in operating this\r\nutility. Nor does the successful administration of a gas works by one\r\ncity necessarily mean that the same city can effectively administer\r\nits street railways.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. NATIONAL OWNERSHIP OF RAILROADS\r\n\r\n343. DEVELOPMENT OF RAILROADS IN THE UNITED STATES.--The railroad\r\nhistory of the United States began when the Baltimore & Ohio was\r\nopened to traffic in 1830, but until the middle of the century\r\ntransportation in this country was chiefly by wagon roads, rivers, and\r\ncanals. After 1850 the westward expansion and the development of\r\nindustry throughout the country greatly stimulated railway building.\r\nEncouraged by lavish land grants and other bounties extended by both\r\nstate and Federal governments, railroad corporations flung a network\r\nof railroads across the continent. Local roads were transformed, by\r\nextension and consolidation, into great trunk lines embracing\r\nthousands of miles. From 9,021 in 1850 our railway mileage increased\r\nto 93,267 in 1880, to 193,345 in 1900, and to approximately 260,000 in\r\n1922.\r\n\r\n344. THE PRINCIPLE OF DECREASING COST.--While the rapid development of\r\nAmerican railroads has had an inestimable effect upon our national\r\nprosperity, railway development has brought with it serious evils. In\r\norder to understand the nature of these evils, let us notice that with\r\nrailroads, as with municipal utilities, the cost per unit of product\r\nor service declines with an increase in the number of units furnished.\r\nA railroad must maintain its roadbed, depots, and terminals whether\r\none or an hundred trains are run, and whether freight or passenger\r\ncars run empty or full. Many of the railroad's operating expenses also\r\ngo on regardless of the volume of business. Thus the cost of handling\r\nunits of traffic declines as the volume of that traffic increases.\r\n\r\nThese circumstances influence rate-making in two ways. In the first\r\nplace, railroads can afford to accept extra traffic at a relatively\r\nlow rate because carrying extra traffic adds relatively little to the\r\nrailroad's expenses. In the second place, rates in general cannot be\r\ndefinitely connected with the expense of carrying specific\r\ncommodities, hence rates are often determined on the basis of\r\nexpediency. This means that high rates are charged on valuable\r\ncommodities because those commodities can pay high rates, while low\r\nrates are charged on cheap goods, because those goods cannot stand a\r\nhigh charge. This is called \"charging what the traffic will bear.\"\r\n\r\n345. EVILS ATTENDING RAILROAD DEVELOPMENT.--Since many of the expenses\r\nof the railroad go on regardless of the amount of traffic carried,\r\nrailroads are constantly searching for extra business. Competition\r\nbetween railroads has tended to be very severe. Rate-wars have been\r\ncommon, because of the small cost of handling extra units of traffic.\r\nIn the struggle for business, railroads once habitually offered low\r\nrates on competitive roads or lines, and then made up for this\r\nrelatively unprofitable practice by charging high rates on non-\r\ncompetitive roads. The desire for extra business, together with the\r\npressure exerted by trusts and other large shippers, encouraged\r\nrailroads to make rates which discriminated between products, between\r\nlocalities, and even between individuals. The ruinous character of\r\ncompetition often led to monopolistic combinations which proceeded to\r\ncharge the general public exorbitant rates, but which rendered poor\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n346. EARLY STATE LEGISLATION.--During the early stages of railroad\r\ndevelopment, the railroads were generally regarded as public\r\nbenefactors for the reason that they aided materially in the\r\nsettlement of the West. But after about 1870 the railroads began to be\r\naccused of abusing their position. A greater degree of legal control\r\nover the roads was demanded.\r\n\r\nThe first attempts at the regulation of railroad corporations were\r\nmade by several of the states. For fifteen years various commonwealths\r\ntried to control the railroads through state railway commissions armed\r\nwith extensive powers. These commissions eliminated some of the more\r\nglaring abuses of railroad combination, but for several reasons state\r\nregulation was relatively ineffective. The states had, of course, no\r\nauthority over interstate business, and most railroad revenues were\r\nderived from this type of business. State laws regulating railroads\r\nwere often declared unconstitutional by the courts. Lastly, powerful\r\nrailroad corporations often succeeded in bribing state legislatures to\r\nrefrain from taking action against them. Due to these influences,\r\nstate regulation was generally conceded to be a failure.\r\n\r\n347. FEDERAL LEGISLATION.--The failure of state laws effectively to\r\ncontrol the railroads led to the enactment by Congress of the\r\nInterstate Commerce Act of 1887. This Federal act created an\r\nInterstate Commerce Commission of seven members, appointed by the\r\nPresident, and charged with the enforcement of the Act. The Act also\r\nprohibited discriminations, and forbade unjust and unreasonable\r\nrates. It required that railroads should make rates public, and that\r\nthey should not change rates without due notice. Pooling was\r\nforbidden, that is to say, railroads apparently competing with one\r\nanother were no longer to merge or pool their combined business with\r\nthe understanding that each was to get a previously determined share\r\nof the joint profits. The objection to pooling was that it suppressed\r\ncompetition and encouraged monopoly.\r\n\r\nIn the years that followed, however, the Interstate Commerce Act\r\nchecked railroad abuses very little. The machinery of the Act was so\r\ndefective as to render difficult the successful prosecution of\r\noffenders. Railroad interests exerted an evil influence upon\r\ngovernment officials who were attempting to enforce the Act. The\r\nadministration of the law was also markedly impeded by the fact that\r\nthe courts tended to interpret the Act of 1887 in such a way as to\r\nlimit the powers of the Commission.\r\n\r\nTo a considerable extent discriminations and unnecessarily high rates\r\ncontinued until after the opening of the twentieth century. Then in\r\n1903 the Elkins Act revived some of the waning powers of the\r\nCommission. Three years later (1906) the Hepburn Law increased the\r\nmembership of the Commission, improved its machinery, and extended and\r\nreinforced its control over rates. In 1910 the Mann-Elkins Act\r\nstrengthened the position of the Commission in several particulars.\r\n\r\nIn spite of this additional legislation, however, the rather sorry\r\nrecord of railroad regulation up to the time of the World War\r\nrepeatedly raised the question of national ownership of railroads.\r\n\r\n348. ARGUMENTS IN FAVOR OF NATIONAL OWNERSHIP OF RAILROADS.--The\r\narguments in favor of national ownership of railroads are similar to\r\nthose advanced in behalf of the municipal ownership of local\r\nutilities.\r\n\r\nThe failure of regulation, coupled with the social importance of the\r\nrailroads, is said to render ownership imperative. Government\r\nownership of railroads is said to have succeeded in several of the\r\ncountries of Europe, notably in Prussia.\r\n\r\nIt is believed by many that government ownership would attract a high\r\ngrade of public official. It is also thought that with the change to\r\npublic ownership the corruption of state legislatures by railroads\r\nwould cease. Since the roads would be taken out of private hands and\r\nadministered as a unit by the Federal government, discriminations and\r\nother unfair practices would cease.\r\n\r\nIt is also held that under public ownership service rather than\r\nprofits would become the ideal. Since profits would no longer be\r\nnecessary, lower rates could be offered. Government ownership would\r\nallow the elimination of duplicating lines in competitive areas, and\r\nwould permit the extension of new lines into areas not immediately\r\nprofitable. Thus railroads now operated solely for private gain would\r\nbecome instruments of social as well as industrial progress.\r\n\r\n349. ARGUMENTS AGAINST NATIONAL OWNERSHIP OF RAILROADS.--Opponents of\r\nnational ownership maintain that the experience of Prussia and other\r\nEuropean countries is no guide to railroad management in this country.\r\nDifferences in political organization between this and European\r\ncountries, for example, render unreliable the results of public\r\nownership in Prussia and other parts of Europe.\r\n\r\nMany opponents of government ownership contend that the elimination of\r\nprivate control would increase, rather than decrease, political\r\ncorruption. Various political interests, they say, would bring\r\npressure to bear in favor of low rates for their particular sections\r\nof the country.\r\n\r\nIt is often maintained that the substitution of public for private\r\nownership would discourage personal initiative because public\r\nofficials would take little genuine interest in the railroads. It is\r\nsaid that government administration of railroads would be marked by\r\nwaste and inefficiency. This would necessitate higher rates instead of\r\npermitting rates to be reduced. The large initial cost of acquiring\r\nthe roads is urged against public ownership, as is the gigantic task\r\nof administering so vast an industry.\r\n\r\nA last important objection to public ownership is that it would cause\r\nrates to be rigid. Rates would be fixed for relatively long periods\r\nand by a supervisory agency, rather than automatically changing with\r\nbusiness conditions as under private ownership. This rigidity would\r\nforce business to adapt itself to rates, instead of allowing rates to\r\nadapt themselves to business needs.\r\n\r\n350. GOVERNMENT CONTROL OF RAILROADS, 1917-1920.--Shortly after our\r\nentry into the World War, the congested condition of the railroads,\r\ntogether with the urgent need for a unified transportation system, led\r\nto a temporary abandonment of private control. On December 28, 1917,\r\nPresident Wilson took over the nation's railroads under powers\r\nconferred upon him by Congress. The roads were centralized under\r\nDirector-General McAdoo, assisted by seven regional directors who\r\nadministered the railroads in the different sections of the country.\r\n\r\nThe Act empowering the President to take over the railroads provided\r\nthat such control should not extend beyond twenty-one months after the\r\nconclusion of the treaty of peace with Germany. But there has never\r\nbeen a well-organized movement for government ownership of railroads\r\nin this country, and when after the signing of the armistice in\r\nNovember, 1918, the immediate return of the roads to private control\r\nwas demanded, there was little opposition. A number of plans proposing\r\nvarious combinations of public and private control were rejected, and\r\non March 1, 1920, the roads were returned to their former owners.\r\n\r\n351. RESULTS OF GOVERNMENT CONTROL DURING THE WORLD WAR.--Government\r\ncontrol of the nation's railroads between 1917 and 1920 resulted in a\r\nnumber of important economies. Repair shops were co÷rdinated so as to\r\nbe used more systematically and hence more economically. The\r\nconsolidation of ticket offices in cities effected a substantial\r\nsaving. The co÷rdination of terminals allowed a more economical use of\r\nequipment than had been possible under private control. The\r\nunification of the various railroad systems allowed a more direct\r\nrouting of freight than would otherwise have been possible. There was\r\nalso a reduction in some unnecessarily large managerial salaries.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the quality of railroad service declined under\r\ngovernment control. The personal efficiency of many types of railroad\r\nemployees also decreased. Most important of all, there was a sharp\r\nincrease in both freight and passenger rates.\r\n\r\nThe period of war-time control was abnormal, hence the record of the\r\nroads under government control during this period cannot be taken as\r\nwholly indicative of what would happen under permanent government\r\ncontrol in peace time. But it should be noted that, on the whole, the\r\nrecord of the Railroad Administration between 1917 and 1920 was good.\r\nThat the above-mentioned economies were effected cannot be denied.\r\nMoreover, the decline in service and efficiency, as well as the\r\nincrease in rates, is at least partially explained by abnormal\r\nconditions over which the Railroad Administration had no control. The\r\nwinter of 1917-1918 was the most rigorous in railroad history. This\r\ncircumstance, combined with the unusually heavy demands for the\r\ntransportation of war equipment, helped to demoralize the service from\r\nthe very beginning of the period of government control. For a number\r\nof years previous to 1917 there had been an acute shortage of box cars\r\nand other equipment, which also helps to explain the poor quality of\r\nservice furnished during the war. The labor force was demoralized by\r\nthe drafting for war service of many trained railroad employees. (It\r\nis claimed that certain railroad officials sought to discredit\r\ngovernment control by hampering the administration of the roads, but\r\nthis charge cannot be proved.)\r\n\r\n352. THE TRANSPORTATION ACT OF 1920.--Government control in war time\r\nrevealed the true status of the railroads as nothing else could. It\r\nwas seen that up to the period of the World War Federal legislation on\r\nrailroads had in some cases been too indulgent, but in other cases so\r\nsevere as to work a hardship upon the roads. To pave the way for a\r\nfairer and more effective regulation of the nation's railroads, the\r\nTransportation Act of 1920 was passed. At present the railroads are\r\nprivately owned, but publicly regulated by the Interstate Commerce\r\nCommission, according to the provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act\r\nof 1887, the Elkins Act of 1903, the Hepburn Law of 1906, the Mann-\r\nElkins Act of 1910, and the Transportation Act of 1920.\r\n\r\n353. SUMMARY OF PRESENT LEGISLATION ON RAILROADS.--At the present time\r\nall unfair discriminations are generally forbidden. But it is now\r\nrecognized that under certain conditions a discrimination may be\r\neconomically justified. Therefore, when the inability to levy a\r\ndiscriminatory rate would work a hardship upon a railroad, the\r\nCommission is authorized to suspend the rule. Pooling is likewise\r\ngenerally forbidden, but here again the Commission may authorize the\r\npractice at its discretion. Limitations are placed upon the power of\r\nrailroads to transport commodities in which they are interested as\r\nproducers.\r\n\r\nAll interstate rates are to be just and reasonable, and the Commission\r\nis empowered to say what constitutes just and reasonable rates. In\r\norder to prevent rate wars, the Commission is now empowered to fix\r\nminimum as well as maximum rates. The Act of 1920 also gives the\r\nCommission the power to establish _intra_-state rates, where such\r\nrates unjustly discriminate against interstate or foreign commerce. An\r\n_intra_-state rate, of course, is one which has to do only with\r\nfreight or passenger movements which begin and end within the borders\r\nof a single state.\r\n\r\nThe Act of 1920 extended government control over the railroads in a\r\nnumber of important particulars. To check certain financial abuses,\r\nthe Commission now has supervision over the issue of railroad\r\nsecurities. For the purpose of increasing the social value of the\r\nnation's railroads, the Act of 1920 instructs the Commission to plan\r\nthe consolidation of existing roads into a limited number of systems.\r\nAnother clause in the Act of 1920 provides that no railroad may\r\nabandon lines, build new lines, or extend old ones, without the\r\nconsent of the Commission. In times of national emergency, moreover,\r\nthe Commission may direct the routing of the nation's freight, without\r\nregard to the ownership of the lines involved. Lastly, the Act of 1920\r\nmade provision for a permanent arbitration board for the settlement of\r\nlabor disputes in the railroad industry.\r\n\r\n354. THE OUTLOOK.--In view of the defective character of regulatory\r\nlegislation previous to 1900, government ownership of railroads did\r\nnot seem unlikely. But since the acts of 1903, 1906, and 1910, and\r\nespecially since the passage of the Transportation Act of 1920, there\r\nhas been such high promise of efficient regulation as to minimize the\r\nmovement toward government ownership. Not only are old abuses now more\r\nlikely to be remedied, but the Interstate Commerce Commission is now\r\nempowered to relieve the roads of many undeserved burdens. Especially\r\nis the Commission keenly appreciative of the necessity of stabilizing\r\nthe credit of the railroads. Until this is done the investing public\r\nwill have little confidence in the railroad business, and the roads\r\nwill continue to be inadequately financed.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the greatest problem now before the Commission is to complete\r\nthe \"physical valuation\" of the railroads begun in 1913. This\r\nvaluation aims to discover, by investigations conducted by expert\r\nappraisers, the actual value of all railroad property in the United\r\nStates at the present time. On the basis of this valuation the\r\nCommission believes that it can estimate the probable amount of\r\ninvested capital which the railroads represent. After this has been\r\ndone, the Commission can calculate what rates the railroads must\r\ncharge in order to earn a fair dividend on their money. The completion\r\nof this physical valuation is, therefore, necessary if the Interstate\r\nCommerce Commission is to fix rates which are just and reasonable from\r\nthe standpoint of the public on the one hand, and from the standpoint\r\nof the railroads on the other.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS ON THE TEXT\r\n\r\n1.

THE PRINCIPLE OF EXCHANGE.--In Chapters VII and VIII it was\r\npointed out that when individuals divide up their labor so that each\r\nbecomes a highly specialized workman there is a resultant increase in\r\nthe community's productivity. Similarly, when one section of the\r\ncountry is adapted primarily to manufacturing, while another section\r\nis peculiarly suited to farming, there is a gain in national\r\nproductivity when each of these areas specializes in those activities\r\nwhich it can carry on most effectively, and is content to resort to\r\ntrade in order to secure the benefit of industries specialized in\r\nelsewhere. So far as the economic principle is concerned, there is\r\nlikewise a gain when different countries specialize in those forms of\r\nproduction at which their citizens are most effective, and are content\r\nto secure through international trade the products of specialization\r\nin other countries.\r\n\r\n356. NATURE OF THE TARIFF.--But though all civilized nations allow and\r\neven encourage the division of labor among their individual citizens\r\nand among the various areas within their own boundaries, many\r\ncountries restrict the degree to which their citizens may exchange\r\ntheir surplus products for the surplus products of foreign producers.\r\nIn the United States, for example, Congress has the power to levy a\r\nduty or tariff on foreign-made goods which are brought into this\r\ncountry for sale.\r\n\r\nThis tariff may be levied primarily to increase national revenue, in\r\nwhich case the rate of duty is generally too low to keep foreign goods\r\nout of our markets. When the tariff is purely a revenue measure, \"free\r\ntrade\" is said to exist. On the other hand, a tariff may be so high\r\nthat domestic goods will be protected in our markets against\r\ncompetition from foreign-made goods of a similar grade. In this case a\r\nprotective tariff is said to exist, though such a measure also brings\r\nin revenue. Most tariff measures, indeed, contain both \"revenue\" and\r\n\"protective\" elements, and it is only when a tariff act is _primarily_\r\na protective measure that we speak of it as a protective tariff.\r\n\r\n357. THE MEANING OF \"PROTECTION.\"--Let us be sure that we understand\r\nexactly what is meant by \"protection.\" Suppose that in the absence of\r\na protective tariff an English-made shoe can be produced and brought\r\nto this country at a total cost of $3.00. Let us assume that this shoe\r\ncompetes in the American market with an American-made shoe which is of\r\nsimilar grade, but which, for various reasons, it costs $3.50 to\r\nproduce. Suppose, further, that both English and American producer\r\nmust make a profit of $0.50 per pair of shoes, or go out of business.\r\nIn the resulting rivalry, the English shoe can sell for $3.50 and make\r\na profit. Competition would force the American producer to sell his\r\nshoe for $3.50 also, but since this would give him no profit, he would\r\nbe forced out of business. In such a case the American manufacturer\r\nmight secure the passage of a protective tariff on this type of shoe,\r\nso that the English shoe would be charged $0.75 to enter this country\r\nfor sale here. This would bring the total cost of the English shoe up\r\nto $3.75, and to make a profit the shoe would have to sell for $4.25.\r\nBut since the American shoe can be sold for $4.00, the English shoe is\r\nforced out of the market. [Footnote: If, in this example, the duty\r\nwere, say, $.25, the foreign shoe could continue to enter our markets\r\nand compete with the American shoe. In this case the tariff would be a\r\n_revenue_, and not a _protective_ measure.]\r\n\r\nThe tariff question arises primarily in connection with the matter of\r\nprotection, and may be stated as follows: Ought Congress to interfere\r\nwith international trade by levying protective duties on imports; and,\r\nif so, just how and to what extent should such duties be levied?\r\n\r\n358. TARIFF HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES.--The first tariff measure in\r\nour national history was the Act of 1789. This was a revenue measure,\r\nthough it gave some degree of protection to American industries. Down\r\nto the close of the War of 1812 our tariff was mainly for revenue\r\npurposes. After the close of that war a heavy duty on foreign iron and\r\ntextile products was imposed for the purpose of protecting domestic\r\nproducers against the cheaply-selling English goods which were\r\nflooding our markets. After 1816 it became our policy to combine in\r\nthe same tariff act high protective duties with revenue duties. In\r\n1824 the general level of duties was raised. In 1828 Congress\r\nendeavored to lay a tariff which would suit all sections of the\r\ncountry, but the attempt failed.\r\n\r\nBetween 1828 and 1842 the tariff was gradually lowered. Between 1842\r\nand 1861 our tariff policy was unsettled, but in the latter year the\r\ndomestic disturbances brought on by the Civil War resulted in the\r\npassage of a tariff which turned out to be highly protective. In the\r\nperiod immediately following the Civil War the tariff continued to be\r\nvery high, due chiefly to pressure from industrial interests which had\r\nsecured protection from the war rates. In spite of attempted reform in\r\n1870, 1873, and 1883, the tariff continued to be highly protective.\r\n\r\nIn 1894 the Democrats reduced the tariff somewhat, and in 1909 the\r\nRepublicans attempted to satisfy a popular demand for lower rates by\r\nthe passage of the Payne-Aldrich Act. This measure reduced some rates,\r\nbut not enough to satisfy the popular mind. In 1912 the Democrats\r\nreturned to power, and the following year passed the Underwood-Simmons\r\nAct, lowering the rates on many classes of commodities, and placing a\r\nnumber of important articles on the free list. In 1920 the Republican\r\nparty again secured control of the government, and the tariff was\r\nraised. At present our tariff is highly protective.\r\n\r\n359. COMPROMISE CHARACTER OF TARIFF.--Our tariff history is full of\r\ninconsistencies. The pendulum has swung first to low duties and then\r\nto severely high duties. No tariff has satisfied all the interests\r\ninvolved; indeed, no other issue, with the possible exception of\r\nslavery, has provoked as much political strife as the tariff. Every\r\ntariff is essentially a compromise, for a duty upon practically any\r\ncommodity which we might select will benefit some of our citizens,\r\nwhile it will either prove of no use to other individuals or will\r\nactually injure them. Animated by self-interest, the farmer, the\r\nlumberman, the miner, or the manufacturer, each desires a protective\r\nduty on the commodity which he produces, and a low rate, or no duty at\r\nall, upon commodities which he consumes. As a result, the tariff has\r\nbecome a sectional problem, in the solving of which Congressmen have\r\ntoo often considered as paramount the economic interests of the\r\nparticular locality which they represent.\r\n\r\n360. NATURE OF THE TARIFF ARGUMENT.--The tariff question generally\r\ndivides men into two camps, those favoring \"free trade,\" and those\r\ndemanding duties that are highly protective. From the standpoint of\r\neconomics, the most vital argument against protection is that there is\r\nno fundamental reason why there should not be free trade between\r\nnations. Protection is economically wasteful because it diverts\r\ncapital and labor from industries in which we are relatively effective\r\nto industries in which our productivity is relatively low. High\r\nprotection is thus said to decrease national productivity, and to\r\nimpose a burden upon the consumer by preventing him from purchasing\r\ncheaper foreign-made goods.\r\n\r\nIn view of these facts, the free trader claims that to the extent that\r\nthe tariff is an economic proposition, the burden of proof rests upon\r\nthe protectionist. If this assertion is accepted, the tariff argument\r\nconsists of the attempts of the protectionist to outweigh the above\r\neconomic argument for free trade by putting forth economic arguments\r\nfor protection, and by developing social and political reasons for a\r\nprotective tariff.\r\n\r\n361. AN EARLIER TARIFF ARGUMENT.--Formerly one of the most important\r\narguments for protection was the home market theory. This theory was\r\nadvanced in 1824 by Henry Clay. In the effort to win the agricultural\r\ninterests to protection, Clay maintained that a protective tariff on\r\nmanufactures would develop urban centers, and that this would increase\r\nthe purchasing power of the city dwellers. This increased purchasing\r\npower, Clay declared, would assure the farmer of a steady domestic\r\nmarket, not only for his staples, but also for perishable goods which\r\ncould not be shipped to foreign countries.\r\n\r\nThough still heard in tariff discussions, this argument now exerts\r\nless influence than formerly. Perfected means of transportation have\r\ntended to place domestic and foreign markets on an equal footing.\r\nMoreover, the population of our cities has increased so much more\r\nrapidly than has the productivity of our farms, that it is unnecessary\r\nartificially to create a home market for the farmer's produce.\r\n\r\n362. THE WAGES ARGUMENT.--At the present time one of the most\r\nimportant arguments in favor of a protective tariff is that it either\r\ncreates or maintains a relatively high level of wages for workmen\r\nengaged in the protected industries. Those advancing this argument\r\nbelieve that free trade would lower wages and depress the standard of\r\nliving for large groups of workmen.\r\n\r\nThe free trader maintains that high wages do not depend upon\r\nprotection, and this for three reasons: First, equally high wages are\r\noften paid in protected and unprotected industries alike; second, high\r\nwages do exist in a number of protected industries, but many of these\r\nindustries also paid high wages before protection had been secured;\r\nthird, there is nothing in a protective tariff to force employers to\r\npay more than the current wage. Rather than raising wages, Professor\r\nTaussig maintains, \"protection restricts the geographical division of\r\nlabor, causes industry to turn to less advantageous channels, lessens\r\nthe productivity of labor, and so tends to lower the general rate of\r\nwages.\"\r\n\r\n363. THE VESTED INTERESTS ARGUMENT.--An important argument in favor of\r\ncontinued protection is that the introduction of free trade would ruin\r\nvaluable manufacturing businesses which have been built up under\r\nprotection, and which are unprepared or unable to maintain themselves\r\nagainst foreign competition. In the case of such industries, it is\r\nmaintained, the removal of protection might result in economic\r\ndisaster. Factories would have to close, investments would depreciate,\r\nand numerous laborers would be thrown out of employment.\r\n\r\nThere is great force in this argument. Even the most ardent free\r\ntrader will admit that a sudden removal of tariff duties might be\r\ndemoralizing to industries long used to protection. Nevertheless, the\r\nvested interests argument is not so much an argument for continued\r\nprotection as it is a reason why there should be a gradual rather than\r\na sudden removal of protective duties. If protection were to be scaled\r\ndown gradually and wisely, there is no reason why capital invested in\r\nindustries unable to stand foreign competition could not be gradually\r\ntransferred to industries unaffected by foreign competition.\r\n\r\n364. TARIFF ARGUMENTS ACCENTUATED BY THE WORLD WAR.--Three arguments\r\nin favor of protection have taken on greater importance because of the\r\nWorld War.\r\n\r\nOne of these is the anti-dumping argument. From the standpoint of the\r\nAmerican tariff, dumping is the practice which some foreign producers\r\nhave of temporarily selling their surplus goods in this country at an\r\nabnormally low price. [Footnote: Some American producers in turn\r\n\"dump\" in foreign markets, but with this practice we are not here\r\nconcerned.] If dumping were permanent, we would gain because we would\r\nbe getting goods at a much lower price than we could manufacture them.\r\nThe evil of dumping grows out of the fact that it tends to force\r\ndomestic producers out of business. Then later the foreign supply may\r\ndiminish, in which case we suffer from a shortage of goods. If foreign\r\nproducers do continue to supply the American market they may take\r\nadvantage of the fact that American competitors have been forced out\r\nof business, and demand monopoly prices. The free trader admits the\r\nforce of the anti-dumping argument, and concedes that the intense\r\neconomic rivalry growing out of the World War rendered desirable\r\ntariff rates which would protect domestic producers against dumping.\r\n\r\nAnother protectionist argument which has gained in strength because of\r\nthe War is the \"infant industries\" argument. Protectionists claim that\r\nindustries really adapted to this country may be prevented from\r\narising here because of their inability, while still in the\r\nexperimental stage, to meet strong competition from well-established\r\nforeign producers. When an industry is in the experimental stage the\r\ncost of production is relatively high, and the price will be\r\ncorrespondingly high. Well established and economically-conducted\r\nbusinesses can undersell these experimental or \"infant\" industries.\r\nProtection for such \"infant\" industries is therefore sought until such\r\ntime as they will be able to stand foreign competition. The free\r\ntrader has generally replied that such protection may be desirable in\r\nsome cases, but maintains that care should be taken to make such\r\nprotection both moderate and temporary, otherwise protection will\r\nperpetuate industries for which we are really unsuited. During the\r\nWorld War American producers began to manufacture dyes and chemicals\r\nformerly imported from Germany. The industrial importance of these\r\nproducts gave weight to the belief that the new industries which\r\nsprang up in this country during the War were entitled to protection\r\nagainst foreign competition.\r\n\r\nA third protectionist argument which was strengthened by the World War\r\nis the military or self-sufficiency argument. It has long been the\r\nclaim of the protectionist that high tariff duties encourage the\r\ndevelopment in this country of all industries producing the\r\nnecessities of life, as well as all supplies which are vital in war\r\ntime. High protection was thus defended on the grounds that it\r\npermitted the United States to be nationally self-sufficing, thus\r\nallowing us to be relatively independent of other countries,\r\nespecially in war time. Previous to the World War many free traders\r\nscoffed at this argument as resting upon an unjustified fear of war,\r\nbut this attitude was changed by the dangers to which we were\r\nsubjected by the interruption of our foreign trade during the war. At\r\npresent the military or self-sufficiency argument is of great\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\n365. THE TREND TOWARD PROTECTION.--Of late years, therefore, there has\r\nbeen a distinct trend toward protection in this country. The fear of\r\ndumping, the desire to protect infant industries established during\r\nthe World War, and the increased importance of the military or self-\r\nsufficiency argument have been factors in this trend. Another factor\r\nhas been that the Republican party, traditionally committed to a\r\npolicy of high protection, returned to power in 1920. A last important\r\ninfluence has been an increased need for Federal revenue. The World\r\nWar not only increased our indebtedness, but the advent of national\r\nprohibition in 1919 cut off a source of Federal revenue formerly very\r\nimportant.\r\n\r\n366. TARIFF NEEDS.--From the standpoint of practical politics, one of\r\nthe greatest needs of our time is for an intelligent and public-\r\nspirited handling of tariff problems. The tariff is a technical and\r\nhighly complex question, upon which politicians have heretofore had\r\ntoo much to say, and trained economists too little. Too often, vague\r\nclaims and political propaganda have carried more weight than have\r\nfacts.\r\n\r\nIt is asserted by many that the tariff can never be taken out of\r\npolitics, but this is perhaps too strong a statement. In this\r\nconnection an interesting development was the establishment in 1916 of\r\nthe United States Tariff Commission. This Commission consists of six\r\nmembers appointed by the President for twelve years. Not more than\r\nthree of the members may belong to the same political party. It is the\r\nduty of the Commission to investigate conditions bearing upon the\r\ntariff and to report its findings to Congress. It is hoped that this\r\nplan will place at the disposal of Congress scientific data on which\r\nto base tariff legislation. So far the Commission has not materially\r\nreduced the influence of politics upon tariff legislation, though it\r\nis perhaps too soon to expect results.\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes said that our tariff policy ought to be less\r\nchangeable. Certain it is that our tariff history is full of\r\ninconsistencies and irrational fluctuations. But the question of a\r\ntariff policy is a thorny one. Manifestly, business should not be\r\nforced to accommodate itself to a purely political manipulation of the\r\ntariff; on the contrary, the tariff ought to vary with changes in\r\nbusiness conditions at home and abroad. Whatever may be implied by a\r\ntariff \"policy,\" it is also certain that the tariff should somewhat\r\naccommodate itself to revenue needs. Beyond these somewhat general\r\nstatements, however, it is hardly safe to say what should be the basic\r\nelements in a national tariff policy.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS ON THE TEXT\r\n\r\n1.

ATTITUDE OF THE EARLY SETTLER TOWARD NATURAL RESOURCES.--The\r\nchief concern of the early American settler was to turn a virgin\r\ncontinent into homes as quickly and as easily as possible. During the\r\nseventeenth, eighteenth, and most of the nineteenth century, our\r\nnatural resources were very abundant, while labor and capital were\r\nrelatively scarce. As the settlers spread across the Appalachians and\r\ninto the great West, it was to be expected, therefore, that the home-\r\nmaker should use labor and capital as carefully as possible and that\r\nhe should use generously such resources as forests, water power, and\r\nsoil fertility. Little blame attaches to the early settler for this\r\nattitude, indeed he acted in accordance with sound economic law. This\r\neconomic law declares that under any particular set of circumstances\r\nfactors of production should be carefully used in proportion as they\r\nare scarce, and generously used in proportion as they are abundant.\r\n\r\n368. RESULT: GROWING SCARCITY OF NATURAL RESOURCES.--The rapid\r\nsettlement of the West was essential to our national unity and\r\ndevelopment. Nevertheless, the extensive and even lavish use of\r\nnatural wealth since colonial times has lately called attention to the\r\nscarcity of resources formerly considered overabundant.\r\n\r\nMore than three fourths of our original forest area has been culled,\r\ncut over, or burned, since colonial times. Wholesale logging methods\r\nhave swept vast areas bare of valuable timber. Careless cutting has\r\nwasted a quarter of our timber supply. In the lumber mill about 40 per\r\ncent of the entire volume of the logs is lost by wasteful methods of\r\nwork. Since 1870 forest fires have annually destroyed more than\r\n$50,000,000 worth of timber. Altogether our timber supply is\r\ndiminishing three or four times as fast as we are replenishing it.\r\n\r\nBy holding sod in place, forests furnish a sponge-like reservoir which\r\nabsorbs rainfall and then retains it sufficiently to insure that it\r\nwill be paid out only gradually. The process of cutting down forests,\r\ncalled deforestation, destroys the sod, so that streams formerly fed\r\nfrom forested areas by a steady process become dangerously swollen in\r\ncertain seasons and greatly reduced in size at other times. One effect\r\nof this alternation of freshets with abnormally dry periods is a loss\r\nof steady and dependable water power.\r\n\r\nDeforestation has also an injurious effect upon agriculture. When\r\nheavy rains wash valuable surface soil from the tops and sides of\r\nhills these denuded areas are rendered less valuable for grazing,\r\nwhile the overabundance of top soil in the valleys retards effective\r\ncultivation. Agriculture also suffers from the fact that streams which\r\nwould ordinarily furnish a steady supply of irrigation water are often\r\neither in a state of flood or practically dried up.\r\n\r\nDespite the excellent work done by the Department of Agriculture,\r\nAmerican farming methods are in many sections of the country both\r\ncareless and wasteful. The abundance of land in past years seemed to\r\njustify our free use of it, nevertheless such use has in many cases\r\nresulted in a serious loss of fertility. Careless tillage and a\r\nfailure to rotate crops have resulted in a heavy loss of nitrogen,\r\npotassium, phosphorus, and other essential soil elements.\r\n\r\nHeretofore we have used coal very lavishly. Often as much coal has\r\nbeen wasted as has been mined. Mining corporations have often\r\nneglected low grade coal deposits, and have abandoned mines without\r\nhaving first removed all of the accessible high grade coal. Imperfect\r\ncombustion, both in dwellings and in industrial establishments, is\r\nsaid to waste more than a third of our coal, as well as creating a\r\ncostly and injurious smoke nuisance. Our consumption of coal is\r\ndoubling every ten years. In view of the fact that our coal deposits\r\nare limited, this increasing consumption is a serious development.\r\n\r\nIron, too, has been used wastefully. The bog iron deposits of the\r\nAtlantic coast were used up before 1800, and as the result of an\r\nintense industrial development since 1850, the supply of high grade\r\nores is being speedily diminished. Oil and gas have been used\r\nlavishly, and even, in some cases, deliberately wasted.\r\n\r\n369. HIGH PRICES.--The lavish use of natural resources which has\r\ncharacterized the American people since colonial times has been an\r\nimportant factor in the cost of living. In early days there was an\r\nabundance of resources and few people to use them; at present the\r\nsupply of many of our resources is greatly diminished, and there is a\r\nmuch larger population seeking to use them. In the case of every\r\nnatural resource the supply is either limited or is failing to\r\nincrease as rapidly as are the demands upon it. The result is higher\r\nprices for coal, wood, iron, oil, gas, and similar commodities. It is\r\nat least partly due to the heavy drain upon our resources that the\r\ncost of building homes, heating them, feeding the population, and\r\ncarrying on the varied activities of American industry is steadily\r\nincreasing.\r\n\r\n370. MONOPOLY.--Throughout the history of our natural resources there\r\nhas been a strong tendency toward monopoly. Natural resources should\r\nbe safeguarded for the benefit of the people as a whole, yet much of\r\nour natural wealth has been monopolized by individuals. Four fifths of\r\nour timber lands are privately owned, and of that four fifths about\r\nhalf is controlled by 250 companies. Two thirds of the developed water\r\npower in this country is controlled by a small group of power\r\ninterests. Defective land laws, the lax administration of good laws,\r\nand extravagant land grants to railroads have allowed private fortunes\r\nto be built up without a proportionate advantage to the public. Coal\r\nand petroleum deposits are controlled largely by a few corporations,\r\nwhile a heavy percentage of our copper and iron deposits is in private\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n371. THE CONSERVATION MOVEMENT.--After the middle of the nineteenth\r\ncentury the growing scarcity of many natural resources called\r\nattention to the need of conserving them. Conservation means to\r\nutilize economically, rather than to hoard. It means, furthermore,\r\nthat resources should be used so that both the present and future\r\ngenerations will reap a proper benefit from America's great natural\r\ngifts. Thus conservation seeks, Mr. Van Hise once said, \"the greatest\r\ngood to the greatest number, and for the longest time.\" The dawn of\r\nthe conservation idea stimulated a reaction against the careless\r\nadministration of natural resources. Toward the end of the 19th\r\ncentury, there was an increasing amount of legislation encouraging the\r\nlegitimate use of natural resources on the one hand, and repressing\r\nmonopoly on the other. After the opening of the twentieth century\r\ninterest in conservation increased. In 1908 President Roosevelt called\r\na conference of the governors of the various states for the purpose of\r\nconsidering this vital problem, and from that meeting dates a definite\r\nand nationwide conservation policy in this country.\r\n\r\nSome of the effects of this changing attitude toward natural resources\r\nmay now be noted.\r\n\r\n372. FORESTS AND WATER POWER.--In 1891 a Federal law provided for a\r\nsystem of national forest reservations. These reservations now include\r\na substantial proportion of our forests, and are steadily extending\r\ntheir limits. Since 1897 there has been a Bureau of Forestry which has\r\nperformed invaluable services. Forest fires have been reduced, denuded\r\nareas have been reforested, forest cutting has been controlled, and a\r\nconstructive program of forest culture developed. Forest reserves\r\nunder the control of the individual states now total more than\r\n10,000,000 acres. Of late years there has been an increasing use of\r\ndams and reservoirs for the storage of flood waters and the\r\ndevelopment of water power. This regulation of streams gives a uniform\r\nflow of water both for navigation and for irrigation purposes.\r\n\r\n373. THE LAND.--The desire to encourage the home-maker has long been\r\nthe motive power behind our public land policy, but unfortunately many\r\nof our earlier land laws did not prevent peculators and large\r\ncorporations from fraudulently securing control of land intended for\r\nthe _bona fide_ or genuine settler. Within the last quarter of a\r\ncentury our land laws have been reorganized, with the double aim of\r\ndoing justice to this type of settler, and of suppressing speculation\r\nand monopoly. As the result of Land Office investigations in 1913,\r\nmore than 800,000 acres were returned to the public domain, on the\r\nground that they had been secured through fraud.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Agriculture has steadily extended its scope. Better\r\nmethods of cultivation, lessons in soil chemistry, and experiments\r\nwith new and special crops have helped conserve the resources of the\r\nland. An elaborate system of experiment stations has been built up\r\nsince 1887. The Weather Bureau in the Department of Agriculture saves\r\nmillions of dollars' worth of property annually by sending out\r\nwarnings of frost, storm, and flood.\r\n\r\nReclamation is increasingly important. New crops are being developed\r\nfor the semi-arid areas of the West. Swamp lands in the East and South\r\nare being drained. Levees and breakwaters along the Mississippi are\r\nhelping to prevent the loss of arable land through the river's changes\r\nin course.\r\n\r\nEven more important is the irrigation movement. In 1894 the Carey Act\r\ngave Federal encouragement to several western states in irrigation\r\nprojects, and in 1902 the Reclamation Act provided for the\r\nconstruction of irrigation works under the direction of the Secretary\r\nof the Interior. The plan provided by the Act of 1902 is self-\r\nsupporting, the expense of the construction and improvement of the\r\nirrigation system being met from the sale of public lands. The\r\nadministration of the Reclamation Act has already resulted in millions\r\nof acres being brought under cultivation.\r\n\r\n374. MINERALS.--Until 1873 coal lands were disposed of on practically\r\nthe same terms as agricultural lands. But after that date laws\r\nrestricting the purchase of coal lands began to be increasingly\r\nsevere. In 1910 Congress withdrew from public sale nearly 100,000,000\r\nacres of coal, petroleum, and phosphate lands. At the present time the\r\ndiscovery of coal on land secured by settlers for purely farming\r\npurposes entitles the government to dispose of the coal deposits under\r\nspecial conditions. There is also a tendency for the government to\r\ndemand higher prices of individuals buying public coal lands.\r\n\r\nIn some quarters there is a demand that all coal lands be leased\r\nrather than sold. The Federal government has not yet yielded to this\r\ndemand, but Colorado and Wyoming now lease rather than sell their coal\r\nlands. Under the lease system in these states, the state retains\r\nownership, but allows private individuals a definite commission per\r\nton of coal mined. The lease system is also advocated in the case of\r\nlands containing iron, oil, and gas deposits, on the grounds that it\r\nsafeguards the interests of the public and at the same time allows the\r\nmining corporations a fair profit.\r\n\r\n375. REASONS FOR OPTIMISM.--In spite of the appalling waste which has\r\nbeen characteristic of our administration of natural resources, the\r\noutlook is distinctly encouraging. Resources used by past generations\r\nare gone forever, but at last we are making rapid strides in\r\nconserving what is left. Not only this, but we are perfecting plans\r\nfor an increased supply of those resources which can be replenished.\r\n\r\nThe admirable work of our Forest Service promises not only to reduce\r\nthe present waste of wood products, but actually to increase the\r\nsupply of timber. The Service deserves high praise both for its work\r\nin saving and replenishing forests, and for its wise handling of\r\nforest problems involving other resources. \"By reasonable thrift,\"\r\nruns a report of the Forest Service, \"we can produce a constant timber\r\nsupply beyond our present need, and with it conserve the usefulness of\r\nour streams for irrigation, water supply, navigation, and power.\"\r\n\r\nWe now appear thoroughly awake not only to the necessity of\r\nsafeguarding what is left of the public domain, but also to the\r\nnecessity of increasing the productivity of inferior lands. There are\r\nstill in this country more than 300,000,000 acres of unappropriated\r\nand unreserved land. Three fourths of this area is at present fit only\r\nfor grazing, but the rapid development of kaffir corn, durum wheat,\r\nPersian clover, and other crops suitable for dry soils bids fair\r\ngreatly to increase the productivity of this land.\r\n\r\nThe irreplaceable character of our mineral deposits, together with the\r\ntendency for large industrial interests to monopolize minerals. has\r\ngreatly stimulated the conservation of these resources. A valuable\r\nstep forward has been the reclassification of public lands to allow of\r\nspecial treatment of lands containing mineral deposits. Coal is still\r\nused lavishly, but nine tenths of our original deposits are still in\r\nexistence. Furthermore, water power, electricity, and other\r\nsubstitutes for coal are being developed. Our high grade iron ores\r\nwill be exhausted in a few decades, but an iron shortage may be\r\nprevented by more careful mining, the use of low grade ores, and the\r\nuse of substitutes.\r\n\r\n376. DIFFERENT RESOURCES CALL FOR DIFFERENT TREATMENT.--A wise\r\nconservation policy will take note of the fact that different\r\nresources call for different types of treatment. Coal, petroleum, oil,\r\nand gas are limited in extent and are practically irreplaceable. These\r\nshould be taken from the earth and utilized as economically as\r\npossible. The same is true of the metallic minerals, such as iron and\r\ncopper, though here the use of substitutes is of greater importance\r\nthan in the case of non-metallic minerals.\r\n\r\nWater can best be conserved by the wise development of water power\r\nsites, and by the careful utilization of streams.\r\n\r\nForests may be renewed, but slowly. Their conservation requires the\r\nprevention of fires, the reduction of waste in cutting and milling,\r\nthe use of by-products, and scientific reforestation.\r\n\r\nSoil elements may also be renewed, though slowly and with difficulty.\r\nReforestation prevents erosion and thus conserves soil fertility.\r\nSystems of crop rotation designed to retain nitrogen, potassium, and\r\nphosphorus are valuable.\r\n\r\n377. SOME CONSERVATION NEEDS.--The above considerations indicate some\r\nof our conservation needs. It is believed by most students of\r\nconservation that the Federal forest holdings should be extended and\r\nconsolidated. There is need for more stringent forest fire\r\nregulations, especially in the case of private forests. In order to\r\nreforest the denuded areas and to grow timber scientifically some such\r\nplan as the German system of forest culture might be adopted. There is\r\nurgent need of a systematic development of our inland Waterways. The\r\nconstruction of more dams and reservoirs, the dredging of rivers and\r\nharbors, the co÷rdination of canals and inland waterways, and the\r\nimprovement of the Mississippi-Great Lakes system, all these would be\r\nhelpful measures. Irrigation and other reclamation projects, including\r\nthe drainage of swamp lands, should be developed systematically.\r\nAmerican farming methods ought still further to be improved. We are in\r\nneed of laws penalizing wasteful methods of mining and prohibiting\r\nuneconomical methods of combustion. Probably the system of leasing\r\nrather than selling mineral lands should be extended.\r\n\r\nA last vital need in conservation is co÷peration between state and\r\nFederal authorities, and between private individuals and public\r\nagencies. This is of great importance. Where rivers course through\r\nseveral states, and where forest fires in one section threaten\r\nadjacent forest areas, co÷peration must be secured. The Governors'\r\nConference of 1908 stimulated co÷peration between the states and the\r\nFederal government, and since 1909 the National Conservation\r\nAssociation has been a means of co÷rdinating the work of all persons\r\nand agencies interested in conservation. There is still, however,\r\nlittle co÷peration between state or Federal governments on the one\r\nhand, and private owners on the other. It is a matter of special\r\nregret that although four fifths of our forests are privately owned,\r\nboth fire prevention and scientific forestry are little developed on\r\nprivate estates.\r\n\r\n378. THE QUESTION OF ADMINISTRATION.--Though it is conceded on all\r\nsides that our natural resources ought to be utilized economically,\r\nthere is much discussion as to whether the states or the Federal\r\ngovernment ought to dominate the conservation movement.\r\n\r\nThose favoring the extension of Federal control over conservation\r\npoint out that forest control, irrigation, conservation of water\r\npower, and similar projects are distinctly interstate in character,\r\nand are thus properly a Federal function. Federal administration is\r\nsaid to be necessary in order to insure fair treatment of different\r\nlocalities. Finally, it is maintained, the states have either\r\nneglected the question of conservation, or have handled it in their\r\nown interests rather than with regard to the national welfare.\r\n\r\nA strong party maintains, on the other hand, that conservation is\r\nprimarily a state function. The movement is said to be too large for\r\nthe Federal government to handle. It is contended that there is no\r\nspecific warrant in the Constitution for the Federal control of\r\nconservation. It is also claimed that Federal administration of\r\nnatural resources has been accompanied by waste and inefficiency.\r\nConservation is said to be a local question, best administered by\r\nthose most interested in the problem, and, by reason of their\r\nproximity to it, most familiar with it.\r\n\r\nThe problem of administration is a difficult one. In a number of cases\r\nthe claims for and against Federal control are obviously sound. But\r\nfrom the standpoint of the public the whole matter is of secondary\r\nimportance: the problem of administration ought to be decided on the\r\nbasis of what is best under particular circumstances. Some phases of\r\nconservation are probably best looked after by the states, others by\r\nthe Federal government, still others by the state and Federal\r\ngovernments jointly. The problem of conflicting authority ought\r\nsomehow to be solved. Conservation is too vital a matter to be\r\nhampered by the question of method or means.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS ON THE TEXT\r\n\r\n1.

SOME PRELIMINARY DEFINITIONS.--Money may be defined as anything\r\nthat passes freely from hand to hand as a medium of exchange. Money is\r\nof two types: first, coin, including gold, silver, nickel, and copper\r\ncoins; and second, paper money, including several kinds of\r\ncertificates and notes. Both types of money, coin and paper, are\r\ncalled \"cash.\" Credit refers to a promise to pay money or its\r\nequivalent at a future date. A bank is an institution which makes it\r\nits special business to deal in money and credit. A check is a written\r\norder directing a bank to pay a certain sum of money to a designated\r\nperson. A bank note is a piece of paper money or currency which\r\nconstitutes the bank's promise to pay in coin and on demand without\r\ninterest, the sum named on the face of the note. A reserve fund is an\r\namount of money or securities which a bank habitually keeps on hand as\r\na partial guarantee that it will be able to meet its obligations.\r\n\r\n380. TYPES OF BANKS.--Of the several types of banks, the savings bank\r\nis perhaps the most familiar to young people. A savings bank will\r\nreceive deposits of one dollar or more, and will pay interest on these\r\namounts. But the savings bank does not pay out money on checks drawn\r\nagainst deposits. Indeed, it may require a formal notice of several\r\ndays before deposits can be withdrawn.\r\n\r\nIn many states there are trust companies. In addition to performing\r\nthe function of a commercial bank, trust companies take care of\r\nvaluable papers, execute trusts and wills, and sometimes guarantee\r\ntitles to land.\r\n\r\nThe investment bank is usually a private institution, conducted\r\nchiefly in the interests of certain large industrial organizations.\r\n\r\nA fourth type of bank is the commercial bank, with which this chapter\r\nis chiefly concerned. The commercial bank derives its name from the\r\nfact that it deals largely with business men. If classified on the\r\nbasis of their charters, rather than on the basis of function,\r\ncommercial banks may be either National, State, or private banks.\r\n\r\n381. PRIMARY FUNCTION OF THE COMMERCIAL BANK. [Footnote: Throughout\r\nthe remainder of this chapter the word \"bank\" should be taken as\r\nreferring to the commercial bank.]--The primary function of a\r\ncommercial bank is to receive the deposits of persons who have saved\r\nsums of money for which they have no immediate use, and to make loans\r\nto persons who desire them. Of course, those who have deposited sums\r\nwith a bank may draw on their accounts at any time, either themselves\r\ndemanding sums of the bank, or directing the bank, by means of checks,\r\nto pay specified sums to others. But experience has taught the bank\r\nthat if it keeps on hand a reserve fund equal to from five to about\r\nthirty-five per cent of the sums for which it is liable to depositors,\r\nit will ordinarily be able to meet all the demands for cash which\r\ndepositors will be likely to make upon it. The bank may then loan out\r\nto business men the remainder of the money deposited with it. This not\r\nonly encourages production, but it allows the bank to secure a reward\r\nfor its services. This reward is in the form of interest paid by those\r\nwho borrow of the bank.\r\n\r\n382. THE NATURE OF BANK CREDIT.--When an individual actually deposits\r\nwith a bank $100 in cash, the bank becomes owner of the $100, and in\r\nturn writes down on its books the promise to pay to the depositor, as\r\nhe shall direct, amounts totaling $100. The depositor receives a\r\ncheck book, and may draw part or all of the $100, as he likes.\r\n\r\nNow it may happen that an individual may wish to increase his checking\r\naccount at the bank, but that he has no actual cash with which to make\r\na deposit with the bank. In this case he may give the bank his\r\npromissory note, together with stocks, bonds, or other forms of\r\nwealth, which the bank holds as security. In return, the bank credits\r\nhim with a \"deposit.\" This means that the bank extends its credit to\r\nthe individual, by undertaking to honor checks for sums not actually\r\nreceived from the depositor.\r\n\r\nThe bank has received valuable security from the borrower and hence\r\nfeels justified in extending him a deposit credit. But, why does a\r\nbank feel _safe_ in undertaking to pay out sums of money which it does\r\nnot actually have in its vaults? The answer is that the bank attempts\r\nto keep on hand a reserve fund sufficient to meet all demands for cash\r\nwhich may be made upon it. If the reserve fund is relatively large,\r\nthe bank will ordinarily loan its credit freely. If the cash reserve\r\nis relatively low, the conservative bank may refuse further loans, on\r\nthe grounds that its cash reserve is too low to justify the acceptance\r\nof additional obligations. The only safe alternative to this is for\r\nthe bank in some way to increase its reserve fund, and then proceed to\r\nextend the amount of credit justified by this increased reserve.\r\n\r\n383. DANGERS OF BANK CREDIT.--The integrity of these various\r\noperations rests upon the confidence which people have in the bank's\r\nability to make good its promises. Confidence in the deposit credit of\r\na bank exists when the past experience of depositors has taught them\r\nthat the bank in question will habitually exchange either coin or bank\r\nnotes for checks. Bank notes are ordinarily accepted in the place of\r\ncoin, because people believe the credit of the bank issuing those\r\nnotes to be so firmly established that the bank would be able and\r\nwilling to exchange coin for its notes, upon demand. A bank is\r\nenabled to meet these obligations promptly, it should be remembered,\r\nbecause it keeps on hand, against the demands of depositors, a reserve\r\nfund of cash, or securities which by law it is allowed to count as\r\ncash. If all of the depositors of a bank suddenly and simultaneously\r\ndemanded the full amount of their deposits in coin, the bank would be\r\nunable to accommodate them; as a matter of fact, business men normally\r\nleave in the bank that share of their deposits which they do not\r\nactually need. So long as men have confidence in a bank, they will\r\nprefer checks and bank notes to the less convenient coin, unless they\r\nneed coin for some special purpose.\r\n\r\nIf properly managed a bank is a profitable business for everyone\r\nconcerned. But even though properly managed, a bank may occasionally\r\nfind itself in a precarious position. There are few matters which the\r\naverage person comprehends as vaguely as banking, and few things which\r\nmore vitally interest him than the safety of his money. These two\r\nfacts combine to render banking extremely sensitive to every rumor of\r\nunsoundness. The careful regulation of banking by law is therefore\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n384. THE NATIONAL BANKING SYSTEM.--The Civil War plunged our\r\ngovernment into serious financial straits. To improve the finances of\r\nthe Federal government there was created, in 1863, a system of\r\nnational banks. The original act of 1863 is still the basis of our\r\nbanking system, though it has since been modified a number of times,\r\nnotably in 1913.\r\n\r\nWe speak of a \"national banking system,\" but as a matter of fact this\r\nterm is inexact. From the beginning of their history, the so-called\r\nnational banks were \"national\" only in the sense that they were\r\nchartered by the Federal government, and were subject to examination\r\nby Federal inspectors. These national banks constituted no definite\r\nsystem: they transacted business much as other banks did, they had no\r\nbranches, and they had little to do with one another. There was little\r\nteam-work, and no effective leadership, so that in time of a\r\nthreatened panic the different parts of the \"system\" worked at cross-\r\npurposes instead of as a unit.\r\n\r\n385. WHY A BANKING SYSTEM MUST BE ELASTIC.--A good banking system will\r\nbe elastic, _i.e._ it will respond promptly to the varying needs of\r\nbusiness. Money and credit constitute a mechanism by means of which\r\nbusiness is handled, just as the labor force of a factory constitutes\r\na means of handling the output of the factory. If the output of the\r\nfactory increases, a larger labor force is needed; if the output\r\ndwindles, fewer laborers are needed. Similarly, if business increases\r\nin volume, an increased amount of money and credit is necessary to\r\nhandle the increased volume of business. If, on the other hand,\r\nbusiness declines, the volume of money and credit ought to decline\r\nalso. Otherwise, there will be so much money and credit in\r\ncirculation, relatively to the amount of goods, that high prices will\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nHigh prices will result for the following reason: Money and credit are\r\nused to exchange against goods. As a general proposition, all the\r\navailable goods in a community are in a process of exchanging against\r\nall of the available money and credit in the community. If goods are\r\nrelatively few and money and credit are relatively plentiful, a small\r\namount of goods can command a large amount of money and credit, _i.e._\r\nthe goods will sell for high prices. A sound banking system,\r\ntherefore, will allow an expansion of money and credit instruments\r\nwhen business is booming, and will permit the contraction of the\r\nmechanism of exchange when business is growing dull.\r\n\r\nThe old national banking system was inelastic in two ways: first, it\r\nprovided an inelastic supply of deposit credit; second, it provided an\r\ninelastic supply of currency or bank notes.\r\n\r\n386. INELASTICITY OF DEPOSIT CREDIT (RESERVES).--It will be recalled\r\nthat the amount of loans which a bank may make depends upon the\r\nmaintenance of an adequate reserve fund. From this it follows that the\r\nlarger the reserve fund the more loans the bank will feel justified in\r\nmaking. Similarly, if the reserve fund shrinks, sound banking demands\r\nthat loans be curtailed. Keeping these facts in mind, there were two\r\nreasons why the supply of deposit credit was inelastic before 1913.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, individual banks kept only a part of their\r\nreserves actually in their vaults. The remainder, and sometimes the\r\nlarger part, of their reserves was maintained in the form of deposits\r\nin other banks. Banks in towns and small cities habitually kept part\r\nof their reserves in the form of deposits in the banks of large\r\ncities, and the latter in turn kept part of their reserves in the\r\nbanks of New York City, the financial center of the country. Hence the\r\ncash reserves of the country tended to collect in New York, where they\r\nwere utilized by New York banks as a basis for extending loans.\r\n\r\nThis was a dangerous arrangement. In the fall of the year large\r\namounts of cash were demanded in the West, in order to pay farm hands\r\nand otherwise \"move the crops.\" At such times the small western banks\r\nhad to demand their deposits in larger banks, while these in turn had\r\nto call for their deposits in the New York banks. The New York banks\r\nwere often embarrassed by these demands, because they made a practice\r\nof fully utilizing the funds left with them, as a basis for extending\r\nloans. The call in the West for cash meant a curtailment of these\r\nloans with a consequent demoralization of eastern money markets.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, individual banks were unable to extend loans to\r\ncustomers beyond the point justified by the amount of reserves in\r\ntheir vaults, or deposited to their credit in other banks. A bank with\r\na total reserve of $10,000 might feel justified in loaning its credit\r\nto the extent of $100,000, but in case demands for additional loans\r\nwere made upon it, sound banking practice would oblige it to refuse\r\naccommodation. Otherwise it might later find itself unable to get\r\nenough cash to pay out against claims made in the form of checks. This\r\npractice of curtailing loans when reserves were depleted was\r\ndemoralizing to business, since the disappointed customer might find\r\nhis entire business blocked, and this in turn would inconvenience or\r\nseriously injure all those who were connected with him in a business\r\nway. Before 1913, each bank stood as a unit, and when its reserves\r\nwere depleted it could not secure temporary aid from other banks.\r\nThere was no centralized control, and no method whereby national banks\r\nmight secure help of one another.\r\n\r\n387. INELASTICITY OF CURRENCY (BANK NOTES).--We have seen that an\r\nincreased volume of business demands an increased volume of money and\r\ncredit. In the previous section it was pointed out that before 1913\r\nthe volume of _deposit credit_ in this country was inelastic. We must\r\nnow notice that _bank notes_, or _paper currency_, are just as truly a\r\npart of the volume of money and credit as is deposit credit, and we\r\nmust note, also, that just as deposit credit was inelastic before\r\n1913, so the issue of bank notes was inelastic. Previous to 1913 it\r\noften happened that the supply of bank notes was smallest when\r\nbusiness was expanding, and that the issue of bank notes increased\r\nduring dull business periods. This statement requires some\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\nThe Act of 1863 provided that National banks might issue bank notes\r\nonly after depositing in the Federal Treasury an amount of United\r\nStates government bonds sufficient to render the bank notes absolutely\r\nsafe. Naturally, the banks made heavy purchases of bonds when the bond\r\nmarket was depressed, and tended to purchase relatively few bonds when\r\nthose securities were high in price. Since the only reason for\r\npurchasing bonds was to enable the b banks to issue notes, more notes\r\nwere issued when bonds were low in price, and fewer were issued when\r\nbonds were high. Unfortunately, the same general conditions that\r\nstimulated business also tended to raise the price of bonds, while the\r\ncauses of slack business often operated to lower bond prices. This\r\nmeans that when business was expanding, and more notes were needed,\r\nbonds were so high that few were purchased, and consequently few notes\r\nwere issued. Similarly, when business was dull, more bonds were\r\npurchased, and more notes issued.\r\n\r\n388. THE PANIC OF 1907.--The panic of 1907 attracted attention to\r\nthese two great defects of the old national banking system, _i.e._ the\r\ninelasticity of deposit credit and the inelasticity of currency. In\r\nthe fall of 1907, a bumper crop caused Western banks to make unusually\r\nlarge demands for cash upon the New York banks. Unfortunately, this\r\ndepletion of reserves came at precisely the time when the demand upon\r\nNew York banks for loans was greatest. There was thus increased\r\npressure exerted upon New York banks for loans, but less justification\r\nfor extending them. In response to the pressure for loans, some New\r\nYork banks over-extended their credit. In October the inability of a\r\nfew prominent banks to pay in cash all of the demands made upon them\r\nstarted a series of bank \"runs.\" Even solvent institutions were unable\r\nto meet their obligations promptly and many failures occurred. A large\r\nnumber of banks were technically insolvent, that is to say, their\r\nassets were invested in forms which prevented their immediate\r\nconversion into cash, so that for the time being demands for cash\r\ncould not be met. The lack of an effective banking system prevented\r\nthese banks from securing temporary aid from banks more favorably\r\nsituated.\r\n\r\n389. REFORM.--The panic of 1907 stimulated financial experts to\r\nattempt to remedy the defects of our banking system. In 1908 a\r\nmonetary commission was appointed to investigate banking experience at\r\nhome and abroad. As the result of this investigation it appeared\r\nadvisable to establish a system which should secure some of the\r\nadvantages of such centralized banking systems as have long existed in\r\nmany European countries. A single central government bank was at first\r\nrecommended by experts, but this was deemed politically inexpedient.\r\nIn view of this fact resort was had to a compromise between a\r\ncentralized and a decentralized system. This compromise was effected\r\nby the Federal Reserve Act of 1913.\r\n\r\n390. FRAMEWORK OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM.--The Act of 1913 is\r\nadministered by the Federal Reserve Board, consisting of the Secretary\r\nof the Treasury and the Comptroller of the Currency, _ex officio_, and\r\nfive other members appointed for ten years by the President. The\r\ncountry is divided into twelve districts, in each of which there is\r\nlocated a Federal Reserve bank. In each district every National bank\r\nmust subscribe six per cent of its capital and surplus for stock in\r\nthe Federal Reserve bank, and thus become a \"member\" bank. State banks\r\nand trust companies may, upon the fulfilment of certain conditions,\r\nbecome member banks. Each Federal Reserve bank is governed by a board\r\nof nine directors, six of whom are elected by the member banks of its\r\ndistrict, and three of whom are appointed by the Federal Reserve\r\nBoard. The Federal Reserve banks are bankers' banks, that is, they do\r\nnot ordinarily deal directly with individuals, but with member banks\r\nonly.\r\n\r\n391. ELASTICITY OF DEPOSIT CREDIT (RESERVES).--The piling up of bank\r\nreserves in New York is impossible under the Federal Reserve system.\r\nThe reserves of any member bank do not ordinarily move beyond the\r\ndistrict, for a member bank may count as legal reserve only those\r\nfunds which it has placed on deposit in the Federal Reserve bank of\r\nits district. There exists what may be called district centralization\r\nof reserves; that is to say, all of the legal reserves of all the\r\nmember banks of a particular district are concentrated in the Federal\r\nReserve bank of the district, and can be utilized as a unit by that\r\nFederal Reserve bank. If in time of stress the total reserves of the\r\ndistrict are insufficient, the Federal Reserve Board may arrange for\r\nthe temporary transfer of surplus funds from one Federal Reserve\r\ndistrict to another. This secures one of the most important advantages\r\nof a central bank without actual centralization.\r\n\r\nElasticity of deposit credit is also provided for in the\r\n\"rediscounting device.\" A bank discounts commercial paper when it\r\nloans an individual, say, $980, on the security of a $1000 promissory\r\nnote. The $20 represents an amount which the bank counts out, or\r\ndiscounts, as payment for the service. A further operation, long known\r\nin Europe as rediscounting, was authorized by the Act of 1913. When\r\nthe reserves of a member bank are too low to justify further\r\nextensions of deposit credit, the bank can send certain types of\r\ndiscounted paper to the Federal Reserve bank of its district, and\r\nreceive in return either a deposit credit or a special form of paper\r\ncurrency called Federal Reserve notes.\r\n\r\n392. ELASTICITY OF CURRENCY (BANK NOTES).--When, in return for\r\ndiscounted commercial paper, the Federal Reserve bank extends a\r\ndeposit credit to the member bank, the _deposit credit_ of the member\r\nbank is rendered more elastic. When, on the other hand, the Federal\r\nReserve bank sends the member bank Federal Reserve notes in exchange\r\nfor discounted paper, the result is a certain elasticity in the\r\n_currency_.\r\n\r\nThe Federal Reserve notes are a new type of currency. They are secured\r\nby the maintenance, in the vaults of the Federal Reserve banks, of a\r\nforty per cent gold reserve for their redemption. Since these notes\r\nare issued to member banks in return for rediscounted paper, the\r\nexpansion of business and the resultant tendency of member banks to\r\nsend discounted paper to the Federal Reserve bank for rediscount\r\ncauses the volume of Federal Reserve notes to expand. When the need\r\nfor additional currency has subsided, there is an arrangement whereby\r\na certain amount of the Federal Reserve notes may be withdrawn from\r\ncirculation. This is important, for if the amount of money in\r\ncirculation continues to be enormous after business has declined,\r\ninflation and high prices result. _A truly elastic banking system\r\nnecessitates contraction as well as expansion._\r\n\r\n393. THE OUTLOOK.--On the whole, it would seem that the Federal\r\nReserve System is a happy compromise between the centralized banking\r\nsystems of Europe and the highly decentralized system existing in\r\nthis country prior to 1913. The Federal Reserve system allows us to\r\nsecure the main benefits of a great central bank without the political\r\ndifficulties attendant upon the existence of such a bank. It does a\r\ngreat deal to make elastic our supply of money and credit. The Federal\r\nReserve Board can mobilize the entire banking strength of the country\r\nin time of stress, so that the strength of one member bank is the\r\nstrength of the whole system. Since it controls not only a substantial\r\nproportion of the bank reserves of the country, but also the privilege\r\nof note issue on the security of rediscounted paper, the Federal\r\nReserve Board can administer the member banks as a unit. The system\r\nmay not eliminate panics, but it is fair to expect that it will reduce\r\ntheir number and lessen their violence.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS ON THE TEXT\r\n\r\n1.

THE INCREASING COST OF GOVERNMENT.--In the United States, as in\r\nother modern civilized countries, the cost of government is steadily\r\nincreasing. The settlement of the Great West, the depletion of natural\r\nresources and the transition from a primitive to an industrial economy\r\nhave obliged our government to pay out larger and larger sums for the\r\nservices of public officials, and for the materials and commodities\r\nused for public purposes. The growth--of our cities and the increasing\r\ncomplexity of our industrial life have greatly increased the number of\r\nactivities which it is to our advantage to carry on, not individually,\r\nbut collectively or through the agency of government. The spread of\r\naltruism and the widening of the concept of social service have caused\r\nthe extension of governmental activity in such new fields as social\r\ninsurance, recreation, and public health. Altogether, our total\r\ngovernment expenditure is more than seventeen times as large as it was\r\na half century ago, while the per capita expenditure is more than five\r\ntimes as great.\r\n\r\n395. SOURCES OF PUBLIC REVENUE.--Writers on taxation generally\r\nenumerate as sources of public revenue, public industries, the public\r\ndomain, gifts, confiscations, fees, special assessments, fines, and\r\ntaxes. At various times and in different countries of the world, all\r\nof these have been important, but in the United States at the present\r\ntime taxes are by far the most important source of public revenue.\r\n\r\nA tax may be defined as a compulsory contribution exacted from the\r\nindividual by the government, for the purpose of defraying expenses\r\nincurred for the common welfare. The government does not return to the\r\nindividual taxpayer a definite commodity or service. In return for\r\ntaxes the government indeed renders many valuable services, such as\r\npublic education, the safeguarding of health, and protection from\r\ndomestic violence and foreign war. But on account of the collective\r\ncharacter of these services, no attempt is made to apportion the\r\npayment exacted of the individual to the benefit which he as an\r\nindividual receives.\r\n\r\nUntil recently our national government secured most of its revenue\r\nfrom taxes on imports, and from excises or internal taxes on such\r\ncommodities as tobacco and liquor. Since national prohibition went\r\ninto effect (1919), the Federal revenues are derived mainly from taxes\r\non imports, from income and inheritance taxes, and from taxes on\r\ncorporations.\r\n\r\nMore than three fourths of the receipts of state and local governments\r\nare derived from the general property tax, the amounts collected from\r\nother sources being as yet relatively unimportant. The general\r\nproperty tax is supposed to be levied upon all the property in the\r\npossession of taxpayers, though as we shall see a little later, this\r\ntax works out very badly. The old \"poll\" or head tax was formerly\r\nimportant, but at present less than two thirds of one per cent of\r\nstate and local revenues are derived from this source. In most states\r\nit is being abandoned because of its small yield, and because of the\r\ndifficulty and expense in collecting it.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. DEFECTS IN AMERICAN TAXATION\r\n\r\n396. LACK OF A TAX SYSTEM.--The fundamental defect of American\r\ntaxation is the lack of a definite and co÷rdinated system. The tax\r\nlaws of most states have been radically changed during the last few\r\ndecades, and are still in a process of development. In many states old\r\ntaxes are being modified or abandoned, and new taxes adopted. But too\r\noften this is being done without regard for the taxation reform of\r\nother states or of the Federal government. As a result, the tax burden\r\nweighs unequally upon different classes, while between state and\r\nstate, or between state and Federal government, there is an\r\noverlapping of tax power. The effect of this overlapping is to create\r\nundue confusion, and to demoralize both tax officials and taxpayers.\r\n\r\n397. LEGAL RESTRICTIONS UPON TAXING POWER.--A serious defect of\r\nAmerican taxation is the lack of correspondence between taxing power\r\nand fiscal needs. Let us inquire into this.\r\n\r\nThe Federal government has important functions to perform, but has\r\npractically unlimited taxing power. So far as the national government\r\nis concerned, the problem of finding sources of revenue is relatively\r\nsimple.\r\n\r\nThe functions assumed by the state governments are as yet relatively\r\nfew and inexpensive, while the power of the state to tax is but\r\nslightly abridged by the Federal Constitution. States have relatively\r\nlittle difficulty in making both ends meet.\r\n\r\nLocal governments, and especially municipal governments, have a large\r\nnumber of functions which are increasingly important. Of the total\r\ngovernment expenditure in this country, about 35 per cent is made by\r\nthe Federal government, 10 per cent by the state governments, and 55\r\nper cent by the local governments. But whereas Federal and state\r\ngovernments have relatively adequate taxing powers, the taxing powers\r\nof local governments are narrowly restricted by the state constitution\r\nand statutes. Such local functions as health, public school education,\r\nand recreation are constantly demanding greater expenditures, yet\r\nlocal governments as yet have few opportunities for securing necessary\r\nfunds.\r\n\r\n398. DEFECTS IN TAX ASSESSMENT.--The defects of tax assessment are\r\nclearly illustrated in the workings of the general property tax,\r\ncalled by some authorities the worst tax in the civilized world. The\r\nbasis of levy is the work of local assessors, who are generally\r\nelective. The assessors estimate the value of millions of dollars'\r\nworth of property, and their estimates are the basis of the tax rates\r\nfor not only township and county, but generally for the state as well.\r\nIncapable and dishonest assessors often work injustice by\r\nunderestimating the value of some forms of property, and\r\noverestimating the value of other forms. In addition, political\r\npressure is brought to bear upon the assessor to cause him to\r\nundervalue the property of the township or county as a whole, so that\r\nthe local unit will bear a relatively small share of the taxes of the\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nThe estimates of the local assessors are commonly subject to\r\ncorrection by a county, and sometimes by a state, board of\r\nequalization. The duty of such a board is to make assessments uniform\r\nand just, but notwithstanding the efforts of these bodies, unequal and\r\nunfair assessments have persisted.\r\n\r\n399. DIFFICULTY OF TAXING INTABGIBLE PROPERTY.--Where taxation is on\r\nthe basis of assessment, it often happens that the tax burden rests\r\nunequally upon different forms of property. Property in tangible form,\r\nsuch as land, cattle, and houses, is easily discoverable, and hence\r\ncannot easily evade the payment of taxes. But intangible property,\r\nsuch as bonds, stocks, or mortgage, can easily be hidden, so that\r\nowners of this type of property often evade their share of the tax\r\nburden.\r\n\r\nThis evasion is often practiced in the case of the general property\r\ntax, which is intended to reach both tangible and intangible property.\r\nThe general property tax worked well a century ago when the greater\r\nshare of wealth existed in tangible form, because local assessors\r\ncould easily locate such things as land and live stock. But the rapid\r\ndevelopment of corporations, bringing with it a rapid increase in the\r\nproportion of intangible forms of property, has rendered the general\r\nproperty tax grossly unjust. The assessors of the general property tax\r\ncannot easily discover intangible property, unless taxpayers co÷perate\r\nwith them. The all too frequent lack of such co÷peration causes a\r\ndisproportionate share of the tax burden to fall upon tangible\r\nproperty. The general property tax is haphazard, ineffective, and\r\ndemoralizing to both tax officials and taxpayers.\r\n\r\n400. DOUBLE TAXATION.--By double taxation is meant the taxation of an\r\nindividual or different individuals twice for the same thing. Double\r\ntaxation is of two kinds.\r\n\r\nThe first type of double taxation is illustrated by the taxation of\r\nboth tangible property and the paper claim upon that property. For\r\nexample, a state may tax a land-owner on his land, and also tax\r\nanother resident of the state on the mortgage which he holds against\r\nthat land. Or it may happen that a state will tax the land, buildings\r\nand other tangible equipment of a corporation, and at the same time\r\ntax those of its residents who hold stock in that corporation, _i.e._\r\nindividuals who hold paper evidence of ownership in the tangible\r\nequipment of the corporation. More generally, however, this type of\r\ndouble taxation arises when the holder of the paper claim resides in\r\none state, while the tangible property lies in another state. In such\r\na case, it is common for one state to tax the paper claim, and for the\r\nother state to tax the property itself. This type of double taxation\r\nis manifestly unfair, and often imposes a ruinous burden upon\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\nThe second type of double taxation is illustrated by the overlapping\r\nof similar taxes between state and state, or between Federal and state\r\ngovernments. Because it is the practice of most states to seek revenue\r\nwithout regard to the taxing activities of other states, or of the\r\nFederal government, it may happen that corporations, incomes, or\r\ninheritances are taxed by more than one agency of government. If a\r\nscientific and co÷rdinated tax system were deliberately to provide for\r\nthis, the supposition would be that such taxation were reasonable and\r\njust, because intended to bear with equal weight upon all forms of\r\nproperty in the taxable class. But because such taxation is haphazard,\r\nit bears with unequal weight upon corporations and individuals, and is\r\ntherefore unjust.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it encourages the evasion of tax burdens. Individuals and\r\ncorporations sometimes migrate from localities or states in which they\r\nare subject to double taxation, to localities or states in which the\r\ndanger of such taxation is less. This in turn has the evil effect of\r\ntempting states and municipalities to neglect taxes on corporations,\r\nincomes, and inheritances for the sake of attracting wealthy\r\nindividuals and large industrial organizations from neighboring areas.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. SOME SUGGESTED TAX REFORMS\r\n\r\n401. IDEALS OF TAXATION.--Summarizing the views of the more generally\r\naccepted writers on taxation, we may say that the following are the\r\nbasic ideals in taxation:\r\n\r\nTaxes should take as little as possible from the people and still meet\r\nthe needs of government. Taxes should be uniform, that is, all taxable\r\narticles of the same class should be levied upon at the same rate. It\r\nis also important that the time, manner, and amount of the tax should\r\nnot be arbitrary, but that the individual's convenience as regards the\r\nterms of payment should be considered. From the standpoint of the\r\ngovernment, taxes should be easy to administer and economical to\r\ncollect.\r\n\r\nA good tax system will be elastic, so that taxes may easily be\r\nincreased or decreased, according as the revenue needs of the\r\ngovernment change. The ability to pay ought to have some influence\r\nupon the extent to which an individual is taxed. Taxes should adapt\r\nthemselves somewhat to the local sentiment as to what is expedient or\r\nsocially desirable.\r\n\r\nFinally, taxation policies should be systematized and co÷rdinated.\r\n\r\n402. ESSENTIALS OF A TAX SYSTEM.--The construction of an ideal tax\r\nsystem in this country would involve three steps.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, each branch of government should be enabled to\r\nsecure revenues actually needed for justifiable purposes. In this\r\nregard the greatest need is to increase the taxing powers of our\r\nmunicipalities. This is imperative if the cities of the future are to\r\ncare for their citizens properly.\r\n\r\nA second fundamental step relates to the separation of taxing power.\r\nEach branch of government should pretty well confine its use of the\r\ntaxing power to definite types of taxable wealth. The Federal\r\ngovernment, for example, might secure most of its revenue from import\r\nduties, excises, an income tax, and stamp taxes of various kinds. Many\r\ntaxation experts believe that the states ought to confine themselves\r\nmainly to license, corporation, inheritance, and, possibly, income\r\ntaxes. Local governments might well secure most of their revenue from\r\ntaxes on franchises, licenses, and real estate. Such a separation of\r\ntaxing power might aid in the adjustment of fiscal needs to taxing\r\npower, as well as helping to remedy the evil of double taxation.\r\nHowever, a complete separation of taxing powers is not necessarily\r\ndesirable, and certainly it is not practicable, for there is a growing\r\ntendency toward duplication in income, inheritance, and other taxes.\r\nAt the present time, for example, not only the Federal government, but\r\nmany of the states levy income and inheritance taxes.\r\n\r\nA third fundamental step would be the co÷rdination of local, state,\r\nand Federal taxing authorities. The central aim of such co÷rdination\r\nshould be so to distribute tax burdens that no form of taxable wealth\r\nwould escape its just burden, and so that no form of wealth would be\r\nsubjected to unduly heavy taxation. There is a growing feeling that to\r\nprevent double taxation and similar evils, all local taxing bodies\r\nought to be co÷rdinated under the state authorities, while for similar\r\nreasons the Federal government ought to have some measure of direction\r\nor control over that share of state taxation which is interstate in\r\nits effects.\r\n\r\n403. REFORM OR ABOLITION OF THE GENERAL PROPERTY TAX.--The reform of\r\nstate and local taxation logically begins with the general property\r\ntax.\r\n\r\nIn many states attempts are being made to reform this tax. In some\r\ncases \"tax ferrets\" are employed to discover tax evaders, a policy\r\nwhich may easily lead to corruption and favoritism. In other states\r\nthe conviction is growing that local elective assessors ought to be\r\nsupplanted by a permanent corps of state assessors, appointed under\r\nthe merit system. This would reduce the danger of unequal and unfair\r\nassessments.\r\n\r\nIn other states there is a tendency to abandon the general property\r\ntax altogether. In New York, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and other\r\nstates, there is a marked tendency to turn over the general property\r\ntax to local governing bodies. In such cases it is intended that the\r\nstate shall depend for most of its revenue upon income, corporation,\r\ninheritance, and license taxes.\r\n\r\nThe future will doubtless see a more widespread tendency toward the\r\nreform or abolition of the general property tax. In some states,\r\nhowever, such changes in the taxation system require constitutional\r\namendment, and constitutional amendment is often a slow and tedious\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\n404. REFORM IN LAND TAXATION.--Coupled with plans for the reform or\r\nabolition of the general property tax are proposals for the reform of\r\nland taxation. A primary aim of these proposals, some of which suggest\r\nelements of the single tax doctrine, is to secure a more correct\r\nassessment of land values. In many cases a state does not now tax the\r\nholder of a mortgage when the mortgaged land is also within the state\r\nand thus directly subject to taxation. This is a desirable\r\ndevelopment, but we ought to go still further, so that the holder of a\r\nmortgage would not be taxed whether or not he lived in the same state\r\nas the owner of the land. A mortgage is obviously not social wealth,\r\nbut a paper claim on wealth, and this wealth ought not to be taxed\r\ntwice.\r\n\r\nSome authorities believe that the tax rate on land ought substantially\r\nto be increased, when it appears that such land is being held for\r\nspeculative purposes. To encourage improvements, it is also proposed\r\nthat certain permanent improvements on land be temporarily exempted\r\nfrom taxation. Lastly, it would appear socially desirable to levy\r\nspecial taxes on urban sites, so as to secure for the community some\r\nshare of the future unearned increment.\r\n\r\n405. THE INCOME TAX.--All taxes ultimately come out of income, but\r\nwhen we speak of an income tax we refer to a direct levy upon income\r\nas it arises, chiefly in the form of wages, salaries, and profits. A\r\nFederal income tax was levied during the Civil War, but in the\r\nnineties the Supreme Court held that such a tax violated the\r\nconstitutional provision that Congress shall not lay direct taxes\r\nexcept in proportion to the population of the states. In 1913 the\r\nSixteenth Amendment to the Constitution permitted Congress to lay and\r\ncollect taxes on incomes without apportionment among the several\r\nstates, and without regard to any census or enumeration.\r\n\r\nSince 1913 Congress has passed several income tax laws, and a number\r\nof the states have also adopted this form of taxation. The essential\r\nfeatures of these laws are as follows. Incomes below a certain amount\r\nare exempt from taxation. The limit of untaxable income is raised for\r\nmarried persons living together. In calculating their net income,\r\nindividuals may make allowance for debts, business expenses, and\r\ncertain other items. Upon all taxable income above a certain minimum\r\nthere is then levied a flat rate, constituting a \"normal\" tax. Where\r\nincomes exceed a certain amount, there is an additional tax. Thus the\r\nincome tax is said to be \"progressive,\" that is, the larger the income\r\nthe higher the tax rate.\r\n\r\nMany benefits are claimed for the income tax. It falls upon those best\r\nable to pay, and it is not easily evaded or shifted by the person upon\r\nwhom it is levied. It is elastic and can readily be increased or\r\nreduced according as revenue needs change. Its progressive character\r\nis a feature which is considered socially desirable.\r\n\r\nThe chief defects of the income tax are two. In the first place, the\r\neffectiveness of the tax depends upon the willingness of the\r\nindividual to declare his full income. This is not always done,\r\nespecially where the income tax is regarded as an undue interference\r\nin the private affairs of the individual. Second, wealthy individuals\r\noften migrate to states where there is either no income tax or only a\r\nrelatively light one. This last defect of course applies only to the\r\nstate income tax.\r\n\r\n406. THE INHERITANCE TAX.--Taxes upon inheritances have come into\r\nprominence since the opening of the twentieth century. Since 1916 the\r\nFederal government has levied an inheritance tax. At the present time\r\nmost of the states also levy this form of tax upon property passing by\r\nwill or under the inheritance laws of the state. The essential\r\nfeatures of the tax are everywhere the same. Small legacies are\r\ngenerally exempt. Legacies to direct heirs are either exempt, or are\r\ntaxed at a lower rate than are legacies to collateral heirs. The rates\r\nare progressive, that is to say, they increase with the size of the\r\nlegacy.\r\n\r\nMany benefits are claimed for the inheritance tax. It brings in a\r\nlarge revenue, and falls upon those who are best able to pay. The tax\r\ncannot be shifted and it cannot easily be evaded. It is easily\r\nassessed and collected, because all wills must pass through the\r\nprobate court. It is held that the state has a social claim upon the\r\nproperty of an individual who has amassed wealth under the protection\r\nof its laws, and that this property ought not to be transferred intact\r\nto those who did not aid in its accumulation.\r\n\r\nIf carried too far the inheritance tax would undoubtedly discourage\r\nthe accumulation of wealth, but tax authorities are already guarding\r\nagainst this danger. On the whole, the inheritance tax is an important\r\naddition to our tax system. Its scope is being rapidly extended: rates\r\nare being raised, the principle of progression is being more\r\nfrequently applied, and exemptions allowed direct heirs are being\r\nreduced. The tax is increasingly used in the effort to redistribute\r\nunearned wealth, though the extent to which this is true depends very\r\nlargely upon local sentiment.\r\n\r\n407. CORPORATION TAXES.--The rapid growth of American industry has\r\nbeen accompanied by an enormous increase in the number and importance\r\nof industrial corporations. The proper taxation of these bodies is now\r\nchallenging the attention of both state and Federal governments.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties of taxing corporations are two: First, how to prevent\r\nthat form of double taxation which results from the fact that several\r\nstates may levy taxes of varying weight upon interstate corporations.\r\nSecond, how to prevent that form of double taxation which imposes a\r\nburden both upon the tangible property of the corporation and upon the\r\nstocks and bonds representing ownership in that tangible property.\r\n\r\nA number of taxation experts suggest meeting the last-named difficulty\r\nby exempting from taxation stocks, bonds, and other securities, and by\r\nimposing, instead, a tax directly upon the capitalization of the\r\ncorporation itself. In the case of corporations which are local and of\r\nmoderate size, this might be effected by the reform of tax laws within\r\na single state. Where, on the other hand, corporations are distinctly\r\ninterstate in character, such reform would require either a careful\r\nco÷rdination of the tax laws of the several states, or a corporation\r\ntax which should be purely Federal in character.\r\n\r\nThe first difficulty mentioned above would likewise have to be met,\r\neither by the co÷rdination of state tax systems, or by allowing taxes\r\non interstate corporations to be levied solely by the Federal\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nIt is claimed by some economists that the virtual impossibility of\r\neffectively co÷rdinating the tax laws of the various states renders it\r\nimperative that all interstate corporations be taxed solely by the\r\nFederal government. In such a case the Federal government would be\r\ntaxing interstate corporations partly for its own benefit, and partly\r\nas the agent of the various states. It is said also that such a\r\nFederal tax should be levied on corporations at the source, _i.e._\r\nupon capitalization rather than upon stocks and bonds. Being applied\r\nat the source, it would reach all forms of corporation wealth. It\r\nwould be easy and economical to administer. So far as corporations are\r\nconcerned, a purely Federal tax on interstate corporations might\r\nprevent both forms of double taxation.\r\n\r\nEven though the states consented to a purely Federal tax on interstate\r\ncorporations, however, it might prove difficult for state and Federal\r\ngovernments to agree upon a fair division of the joint revenues\r\nderived from such a tax.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS ON THE TEXT\r\n\r\n1.

DISTINCTION BETWEEN CITIZENSHIP AND THE SUFFRAGE.--Citizenship\r\nimplies membership in a nation. A citizen owes allegiance to his\r\ngovernment, and in return is entitled to the fundamental advantages of\r\norganized government, such as the protection of life, liberty and\r\nproperty at home and abroad. Suffrage, on the other hand, is the\r\nprivilege of sharing in government by the exercise of the vote. Most\r\nvoters are also citizens, but less than a third of the citizens of the\r\nUnited States are voters. Citizenship is determined by the Federal\r\nauthorities, the Constitution declaring that all persons born or\r\nnaturalized in the United States are citizens thereof. The suffrage is\r\na privilege which is controlled by the individual states, subject to\r\ncertain regulations imposed by the Federal government.\r\n\r\n409. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SUFFRAGE.--In a representative democracy such\r\nas the United States, the question of the suffrage is of fundamental\r\nimportance. Public officials are agents which have been chosen to\r\nadminister the affairs of government. Every public official in the\r\nUnited States is either chosen directly by the people, or is chosen by\r\nagents who themselves have been selected at the polls. The right to\r\nvote is thus the right to share in the control of government. And not\r\nonly are voters making rules and regulations for their own government,\r\nbut they are governing those citizens to whom the suffrage has not\r\nbeen extended. It is because of this double responsibility resting\r\nupon the American voter that a fundamental problem of effective\r\ngovernment is concerned with the suffrage.\r\n\r\n410. SUFFRAGE IN THE SEVENTEENTH AND EIGHTEENTH CENTURIES.--In\r\ncolonial times the American suffrage was narrowly restricted. Though\r\nthe theory that all men were free and equal was known in political\r\ncircles, the actual conduct of government was largely in the hands of\r\nthe propertied classes. With a few exceptions, no Negro was allowed to\r\nvote. As a general rule, women were also debarred from the suffrage.\r\nEven white adults were denied the exercise of the suffrage unless they\r\ncould meet certain property and religious qualifications.\r\n\r\nThe Declaration of Independence laid emphasis upon the principle that\r\ngovernments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed.\r\nNevertheless this principle was not held to apply to the internal\r\npolitics of the American states, and so there was at this time no\r\nwidespread feeling that all adults had an equal right to share in\r\ngovernment. In an important sense, the American Revolution was fought\r\nto maintain the principle that England could not govern the colonies\r\nwithout their consent. But here again it should be noted that none of\r\nthe states that won independence interpreted that principle to mean\r\nthat all of their free adult citizens had a right to govern themselves\r\nthrough the vote. Colonial standards of suffrage were largely carried\r\nover into our earlier national history, and in 1789 probably less than\r\nfive per cent of the American people were voters. Interpreted in terms\r\nof the suffrage, American democracy was still very narrowly\r\nrestricted.\r\n\r\n411. SUFFRAGE AS A NATURAL RIGHT.--According to the doctrine of\r\nnatural rights, all men are born free and equal, and are entitled to\r\ncertain fundamental rights of which they may not be deprived. Many of\r\nthe colonists were familiar with this theory, but not until after 1800\r\ndid it constitute an important basis for maintaining that all adult\r\nwhite males were entitled to the suffrage. After the opening of the\r\nnineteenth century, however, it was more common for propertyless men\r\nto maintain that just as they had a natural right to life, liberty,\r\nand the pursuit of happiness, so they had a natural right to the\r\nsuffrage. The principle that governments derive their just powers from\r\nthe consent of the governed was by many interpreted to mean that men\r\npossessing property had no right to govern men who could not meet the\r\nproperty qualifications accompanying the suffrage. The cry of \"No\r\ntaxation without representation,\" was also raised in the interests of\r\nwhite adult males who paid taxes, but who were not allowed to vote.\r\n\r\n412. EXTENSION OF THE SUFFRAGE IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY.--During the\r\nfirst three quarters of the nineteenth century, the suffrage widened\r\nsteadily. Religious qualifications practically disappeared before\r\n1850. After a long drawn out struggle most of the eastern states\r\npractically eliminated the property qualification from their suffrage\r\nlaws. This change was due, in large part, to the influence of the\r\ndoctrine of natural rights. There were additional factors, of course.\r\nIn many places along the Atlantic seaboard, for example, the extension\r\nof the suffrage was somewhat in response to the influence of the\r\ndoctrine of natural rights, but it was also partly due to the economic\r\npressure exerted by the increasing number of landless laborers who\r\nwere crowding into the manufacturing cities and towns.\r\n\r\nThe extension of the suffrage during this period is closely associated\r\nwith the development of the West. Whereas the eastern states removed\r\nproperty and religious qualifications only after a struggle, many\r\nwestern states imposed few or no restrictions upon the suffrage, but\r\nfrom the start were committed to the principle of equality at the\r\npolls. The doctrine that governments derive their just powers from the\r\nconsent of the governed was popular in the West; indeed, it was here\r\nthat the doctrine was first applied to the problem of suffrage in a\r\ndefinite and practical manner. In the more sparsely settled portions\r\nof the country, able-bodied men were more important than social\r\ndistinctions and religious ties, so much so, in fact, that some of the\r\nwestern states attracted settlers by giving the vote to aliens who had\r\nannounced their intention of becoming citizens. After the Civil War\r\nsome of the southern states made similar advances to European\r\nimmigrants.\r\n\r\nAfter the Civil War the suffrage movement was profoundly affected by\r\nthe Negro question. The Thirteenth Amendment, adopted in 1865, had\r\nmerely abolished slavery. In the subsequent discussion over the status\r\nof the Negro, some white men held that the theory of natural rights\r\nentitled the freed Negroes to the suffrage. This view was opposed by\r\nmany, particularly in the South. Nevertheless, in 1868 the Fourteenth\r\nAmendment to the Constitution provided that any state denying any of\r\nits male adult citizens the right to vote might suffer a reduction in\r\nits congressional representation. Two years later (1870) the Fifteenth\r\nAmendment went a step further, and declared that the right of citizens\r\nof the United States to vote might not be denied or abridged on\r\naccount of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.\r\n\r\nThe nineteenth century also witnessed an increased interest in woman\r\nsuffrage. The proposition was not unknown even in colonial times, but\r\nthe earlier state constitutions and statutes had almost invariably\r\nexcluded women from the vote. After the middle of the century the\r\nwoman suffrage movement grew rapidly, stimulated, to a considerable\r\nextent, by the movement for abolition and Negro suffrage. In 1852\r\nSusan B. Anthony assumed leadership of the woman suffrage movement,\r\nand in 1875 she drafted a proposed amendment to the Federal\r\nConstitution which would provide for woman suffrage throughout the\r\ncountry. The territory of Wyoming had extended women full suffrage in\r\n1869, and a decade later the right to vote in school elections had\r\nbeen extended the women of Michigan, Minnesota, and several other\r\nStates. By 1896 Colorado, Idaho, and Utah had extended full suffrage\r\nto women.\r\n\r\n413. DECLINE OF THE NATURAL RIGHTS THEORY.--During the latter half of\r\nthe nineteenth century the doctrine of natural rights was of declining\r\nimportance as a basis of the suffrage. The doctrine was illogical, for\r\nnot even its most ardent advocates would go so far as to maintain that\r\npaupers and mental defectives had an inherent right to vote. Nor did\r\nanyone claim that persons under twenty-one years of age had such a\r\nright.\r\n\r\nAs time went on, the connection between the suffrage and the doctrine\r\nof natural rights seemed more and more remote. Men came gradually to\r\nbelieve that the suffrage was not a right but a _privilege_, and that\r\nthe capacity of the individual to use the vote in the public interest\r\nwas the factor which should determine whether or not he should enjoy\r\nthe suffrage. This changed viewpoint reflected itself in several\r\nimportant shifts in the suffrage movement.\r\n\r\n414. SHIFTS IN THE SUFFRAGE MOVEMENT.--To a considerable extent the\r\ndecline of the doctrine of natural rights was accompanied by increased\r\nrestrictions upon the right to vote. We have noted that many western\r\nand a few southern states formerly made a practice of extending the\r\nvote to aliens who had announced their intention of becoming citizens.\r\nAfter the seventies there was a tendency for such states to withdraw\r\nthis privilege, and to make citizenship a prerequisite to voting. One\r\nreason for this changed attitude was that as time went on immigrant\r\nlabor was less in demand in the West and South. Still another factor,\r\nhowever, was the abuse of the ballot among unassimilated immigrant\r\ngroups in our cities.\r\n\r\nAfter the middle of the nineteenth century, there was a growing\r\nfeeling, originating in New England and spreading westward, that\r\nilliterate voters were a menace to sound government. Accordingly,\r\neducational tests were imposed in a number of states. These tests\r\ngenerally require voters to be able to read and write.\r\n\r\nThe enfranchisement of the Negro was followed by reaction. The\r\nexercise of the suffrage by ignorant Negroes suddenly admitted to full\r\nsuffrage, resulted in gross abuses of political power. As a result\r\nmany southern states eventually passed laws which virtually deny the\r\nvote to the larger part of the possible Negro electorate. In some\r\ncases white election officials administer the educational test so\r\nstrictly as to exclude most Negroes. In other cases a property or poll\r\ntax qualification has been used to exclude large groups of shiftless\r\nNegroes. In still other cases a \"grandfather clause\" in the state\r\nconstitution exempts from the educational test all who are descendants\r\nof persons voting before the Civil War. This allows white illiterates\r\nto vote, but excludes illiterate Negroes.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the cause of woman suffrage was greatly stimulated\r\nby the decline of the doctrine of natural rights and the rise of the\r\ntheory that civic capacity should determine the suffrage. Particularly\r\nafter 1900 did the agitation take on national importance. A national\r\nWoman Suffrage Association was organized, and powerful pressure was\r\nbrought to bear upon persons of political influence. Between 1910 and\r\n1912 Washington, California, Oregon, Kansas, and Arizona were won to\r\nthe cause of woman suffrage. Finally in August, 1920, the amendment\r\nwhich Miss Anthony had drafted in 1875 was ratified and declared in\r\nforce. Women are now allowed the vote on the same terms as men.\r\n\r\n415. PRESENT RESTRICTIONS ON THE RIGHT TO VOTE.--The suffrage in the\r\nseveral states at the present time may be summarized as follows:\r\n\r\nIn every state voters must be at least 21 years of age. In a few\r\nstates the vote is extended to aliens who have declared their\r\nintention of becoming citizens. In every state a period of residence\r\nis required of voters, the usual period being between six months and a\r\nyear. Educational qualifications are imposed in about a third of the\r\nstates. A number of southern and a few northern states require voters\r\nto be assessed for a poll tax. In practically every state such\r\nabnormal persons as the feeble-minded, the insane, paupers in\r\ninstitutions, and certain types of criminals are excluded from the\r\nsuffrage. Untaxed Indians, and foreign-born Chinese and Japanese do\r\nnot enjoy the suffrage.\r\n\r\n416. PRESENT STATUS OF THE SUFFRAGE MOVEMENT.--The suffrage movement\r\nhas steadily increased the number of potential voters until at the\r\npresent time there are more than 30,000,000 persons in the United\r\nStates who are entitled to the vote. The important groups of the adult\r\npopulation have been enfranchised, but the suffrage movement still\r\ninvolves important problems. In view of our changing attitude toward\r\nthe suffrage we face four unanswered questions:\r\n\r\nFirst, should the present restrictions on the suffrage be lowered?\r\nSecond, should they be made more severe? Third, in view of the fact\r\nthat naturalization automatically makes voters of many individuals, to\r\nwhat extent ought the grant of citizenship to be determined by the\r\nindividual's promise as a voter? Fourth, what should be our attitude\r\ntoward Negro suffrage?\r\n\r\nLet us summarize the fundamental considerations which must be borne in\r\nmind in discussing the four problems suggested above. This done, we\r\nmay briefly consider the most pressing of these questions, _i.e._ that\r\ninvolving Negro suffrage.\r\n\r\n417. THE SUFFRAGE IS A PRIVILEGE AND NOT RIGHT.--The significance of\r\nthe difference between citizenship and the suffrage should be clearly\r\nunderstood. Citizenship is a fundamental matter. In return for\r\nallegiance to his government, the citizen may be considered as being\r\nentitled to that measure of protection which is deemed necessary to\r\nhis safety and well-being. But though we speak loosely of the \"right\"\r\nof suffrage, the suffrage is a privilege, not a right. The individual\r\ncannot claim it as a corollary of citizenship. Nor does mere residence\r\nin a democratic country entitle the individual to the ballot. The\r\nsafety and well-being of the citizen are not necessarily dependent\r\nupon his exercise of the vote. Indeed, incapable persons may be better\r\noff if they are excluded from the suffrage, provided, of course, that\r\nthe voting class holds itself responsible for the government of the\r\nexcluded groups. Fitness alone justifies the suffrage.\r\n\r\n418. WHAT CONSTITUTES FITNESS?--The ballot cannot be exercised by the\r\nunfit without endangering the whole fabric of government. But what is\r\nthe standard of fitness? The history of the suffrage in the United\r\nStates throws some light upon this question. In colonial times the\r\nplea of the propertied classes was that fitness was primarily a matter\r\nof racial origin, the ownership of property, or church affiliation.\r\nAccording to the theory of natural rights, fitness was vaguely\r\nassociated with manhood and citizenship. More recently we have come to\r\nbelieve that while many factors influence the capacity of the voter,\r\nsuch factors as religion, racial origin, and ownership of substantial\r\namounts of property, are not vital. A definite standard of fitness has\r\nnever been established, but at least we can say that fitness means\r\nboth the desire and the capacity to serve the state by an honest and\r\nintelligent use of the ballot.\r\n\r\n419. THE QUESTION OF NEGRO SUFFRAGE.--We are beginning to suspect that\r\nthe attention attracted by Negro suffrage is due, not so much to the\r\ninjustice of disfranchising the Negro as to the spectacular\r\ncircumstances surrounding the American Negro. It is unjust, of course,\r\nto exclude the Negro from the vote merely because of his race. But\r\nexclusion of Negroes not qualified to make an intelligent use of the\r\nballot is no more unfair than are the educational tests imposed by\r\nmany northern states. To exclude illiterate Negroes from the vote, and\r\nat the same time to allow illiterate whites the ballot, is, on the\r\nother hand, manifestly unfair. But far more productive of good than\r\ndebating this unfairness is the attempt to fit the Negro for the vote\r\nas a prerequisite to his exercise of it. During this preparation the\r\nNegro should have before him the incentive of securing the ballot when\r\nhe has made sufficient progress in education and civic responsibility.\r\n\r\n420. PROBLEM OF AN INTELLIGENT ELECTORATE.--The problem of building up\r\nan intelligent electorate gives rise to two additional questions:\r\nFirst, how may the enfranchised classes be trained to a full\r\nrealization of their civic responsibilities? Second, to what extent is\r\nintelligent voting dependent upon actual exercise of the suffrage? The\r\nfirst question has been treated elsewhere, and we may close this\r\nchapter with a brief consideration of the second question.\r\n\r\nIt is maintained by some that no one should be admitted to the\r\nsuffrage who has not first demonstrated his capacity to use the vote\r\nintelligently. Others reply that this capacity comes only through\r\nactual exercise of the vote. The solution of this problem probably\r\nlies in a judicious combination of theory and practice. A boy cannot\r\nlearn to swim by standing on the bank and forever listening to\r\ntheoretical instruction; on the other hand, it may prove fatal to push\r\nhim into deep water without preparation for that step. Instruction and\r\npractice must go hand in hand, wisely interwoven and harmonized.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, it would seem, one way to secure an intelligent electorate\r\nis to admit individuals to the suffrage only when they demonstrate a\r\nminimum capacity for civic service, but at the same time to recognize\r\nthat _full_ moral development can come only through actual exercise of\r\nthe vote.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS ON THE TEXT\r\n\r\n1.

NATURE OF THE POLITICAL PARTY.--A political party may be defined\r\nas a voluntary association of voters, entered into for the purpose of\r\ninfluencing elections to public office. The individuals comprising a\r\nparty have certain broad political principles in common, and these\r\nthey seek, by organized effort, to have applied to actual government.\r\nJust as individuals differ on matters of business or religion, so it\r\nis human nature for the voters of a community to form varying opinions\r\nas to the nature, functions, and methods of government. And just as\r\nmen tend to draw away from those with whose opinions they do not\r\nagree, so they tend to draw toward those with whom they are in\r\nagreement, and with whose co÷peration they may advance principles of\r\nmutual interest. It is this natural tendency of men, first, to differ\r\nwith one another, and second, to form associations for the advancement\r\nof mutual aims, that has led to the formation of political parties.\r\n\r\n422. DEVELOPMENT OF PARTIES IN THE UNITED STATES.--The American\r\npolitical party is older than the nation. Differences of political\r\nopinion divided the American colonists into Whigs and Tories. Later,\r\nparty spirit was manifested in the formation of the Revolutionary\r\ncommittees of correspondence. The struggle over the Constitution of\r\n1787 divided men into Federalists and Anti-Federalists. The question\r\nof a broad or a strict construction of the constitution, the tariff,\r\nand the problem of slavery in the territories,--these are a few of the\r\ngreat national issues that have influenced party lines. Before the\r\nCivil War party spirit had extended to all parts of the country,\r\nevidencing itself in a number of party organizations. Many of these\r\norganizations proved temporary, but since the Civil War party lines\r\nhave been relatively fixed. For more than a half century there have\r\nbeen two great parties, the Democratic and the Republican. Third\r\nparties have been either temporary or relatively unimportant.\r\n\r\n423. PARTY ORGANIZATION.--There is no constitutional basis or\r\nprovision for American political parties, nevertheless each of the\r\ngreat parties has built up a powerful organization which co÷rdinates\r\nparty members in every part of the country. In practically every\r\ntownship, village, election district, and city ward there are party\r\nagents and local committees whose work it is to promote the interests\r\nof the party both at election time and between elections. The local\r\nparty workers constitute a link between individual voters and the\r\ncounty or State committees, while these latter groups in turn connect\r\nwith the national committee of the party.\r\n\r\nIt is the work of all those officially connected with this centralized\r\norganization to win adherents to the party standard, to place issues\r\nbefore the voters, to stimulate interest in candidates, to organize\r\nmeetings and clubs, to collect funds for party support, to secure the\r\nregistration of voters, and to see that they get to the polls. Party\r\nopinion is formed by means of personal contacts, campaign literature,\r\nspeeches, parades, and every manner of propaganda. Party opinion is\r\nformally expressed through the caucus, the primary, the convention,\r\nand the regular election. (See Sections 435-438.)\r\n\r\n424. SERVICES PERFORMED BY THE POLITICAL PARTY.--The political party\r\nperforms three great services. [Footnote: The following arrangement of\r\nthe services of the political party was suggested to me by Professor\r\nW. B. Munro, of Harvard University. For a fuller discussion see\r\nChapter XXII of his _The Government of the United States_, The\r\nMacmillan Company, New York, 1919.]\r\n\r\nThe first of these is that the party provides machinery which bridges\r\nover the gaps between local, state, and National government.\r\nSimilarly, it often serves to bring the executive, legislative, and\r\njudicial branches of government into harmony with one another. The\r\ncheck and balance system so divides authority in American government\r\nthat in many ways the different branches and divisions of government\r\nare unco÷rdinated. The party facilitates the working of American\r\ngovernment because party members affiliated with one division of\r\ngovernment will tend to co÷perate with members of the same party who\r\nmay be in control of other divisions of government. For example, a\r\nDemocratic governor tends to co÷perate with the Democratic members of\r\nthe state legislature. Similarly, a Republican President will tend to\r\nwork in harmony with those members of his party who are in control of\r\npurely state government.\r\n\r\nThe second great service performed by the party is that it formulates\r\npublic issues and presents them in concrete shape to the voters. Just\r\nas in industry it is the function of the entrepreneur to co÷rdinate\r\nthe other factors of production, so in government it is the function\r\nof the politician to act as a co÷rdinator. Indeed, President Lowell\r\ncalls the politician a broker, without whose services popular\r\ngovernment would be impossible. If voters went to the polls with no\r\nprevious agreement as to candidates or issues, but each determined to\r\nvote for whomever he liked, thousands of names might be found on the\r\nballot. If a majority were required to elect, no individual would be\r\nchosen. The party thus performs a valuable service by formulating\r\nthose principles which will attract the greatest number of voters, and\r\nby definitely associating those principles with particular candidates.\r\nThese issues and these candidates the party places squarely before the\r\nelectorate, to the exclusion of minor issues and unimportant\r\ncandidates. The party is thus a means whereby democracy makes up its\r\nmind, and expresses that mind with a minimum of confusion and\r\ndisorder.\r\n\r\nThe third great service of the political party is that it provides a\r\nmeans of collective and continuing responsibility in politics. If a\r\ncandidate were not affiliated with any political party, misbehavior in\r\noffice might result in his removal or in his failure to secure\r\nreŰlection. But here responsibility would end. When, on the other\r\nhand, the party selects, supports, and vouches for a candidate, the\r\nparty constitutes a definite and permanent pledge to the voters. Thus\r\nthe party is stimulated to select its candidates carefully, lest their\r\nincompetence or dishonesty fatally injure the reputation of the party.\r\nThe past exploits of the party are appropriated for future campaigns;\r\nconversely, the failure or misbehavior of an officeholder will be\r\npointed out by his political enemies as typical of the party to which\r\nthe unfortunate man belongs.\r\n\r\n425. THE ABUSE OF PARTY POWER.--Though party government confers\r\nsubstantial benefits, it is likewise true that the power of the\r\npolitical party has been frequently abused. American party\r\norganizations sprang up silently, and developed largely without legal\r\ncontrol. Increased power has been accompanied by diffused\r\nresponsibility; increased power and diffused responsibility have led\r\nto the abuse of power. The evils of the party are numerous, and only\r\nthose of fundamental importance can be discussed in this text. Some of\r\nthese evils will appear in successive chapters; a few may be treated\r\nhere. In every case, it should be borne in mind, the basic defect of\r\nparty government is that the party has tended to use its power\r\nprimarily for private rather than public ends.\r\n\r\n426. CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS.--Throughout much of our national history\r\none of the great evils of the political party has had to do with\r\ncontributions to the campaign fund. A few decades ago it was the\r\ncustom of parties, not only to accept large sums of money from special\r\ninterests, but actually to demand substantial contributions from\r\nrailroad and other corporations on pain of unfriendly legislation when\r\nthe party got into power. In our cities gambling houses and other\r\nvicious interests habitually contributed to the campaign fund of the\r\nparty, with the understanding that the party so supported would, if\r\nsuccessful at the polls, protect these unlawful businesses. Large\r\namounts were also secured from officeholders who feared to incur the\r\nill will of the party by refusing to contribute to the campaign fund.\r\nThe enormous sums got together from these various sources were used to\r\nfinance election contests, the peak being reached when in the\r\npresidential election of 1896 the Republican party is said to have\r\nspent more than $7,000,000. The source of most of this sum was unknown\r\nto the general public.\r\n\r\nFortunately, recent legislation has remedied a considerable measure of\r\nthe evils attending unrestricted contributions to the campaign fund.\r\nLaws now prohibit party agents from seeking contributions from the\r\nholders of Federal civil service offices. In 1910 and 1911 Congress\r\npassed Acts providing that a candidate for Representative to Congress\r\nmay not expend more than $5000 toward his election, while a United\r\nStates Senator may not spend more than $10,000 for a similar purpose.\r\nOther laws specify the purposes for which campaign money may be spent.\r\nIn presidential and congressional elections the treasurer of the\r\nnational committee of each party must now report the entire campaign\r\nfund contributed and expended, giving the name of every individual\r\ncontributing over $1000, and also furnishing an itemized statement of\r\nall expenditures over $10. This report is filed with the clerk of the\r\nHouse of Representatives, and is open to the public.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt but that these and similar laws have operated to\r\ndeprive the campaign fund of many of its illegitimate features. Most\r\nof the money now expended by parties is secured from a large number of\r\nsmall contributions. This not only lessens the control of party\r\npolicies by special interests, but it also serves to make the party\r\nmore responsible to the rank and file of the organization.\r\n\r\n427. PARTY DOMINATION OF NOMINATIONS AND ELECTIONS.--A great problem\r\nof party government is to prevent parties from unduly influencing the\r\nchoice of public officials. Leaving until later the general question\r\nof nominations and elections, it may be pointed out here that very\r\noften the whole weight of party power is directed toward securing the\r\nelection to office of candidates deemed desirable by the party\r\nmachine. The political \"boss\" has consistently used his power to\r\nmanipulate the caucus or the primary so as to advance his own\r\ninterests at public expense. Caucuses have been held without proper\r\nnotice being given, and party henchmen have been employed to work for\r\nan inside clique or ring. Formerly the rolls of party members were\r\npadded with the names of men dead or absent. Too often elections were\r\ncharacterized by the stuffing of ballot boxes, the intimidation or\r\nbribery of voters, and the practice of voting more than once. The\r\neffect of these and similar practices has been to thwart the will of\r\nthe majority of party members, and to elevate self-interest above the\r\ngeneral welfare.\r\n\r\nThe last few decades of American political history have been\r\ncharacterized by a number of laws designed to safeguard the process of\r\nnomination and election. In practically every state in the Union there\r\nare corrupt practices acts which aim not only to prevent the misuse of\r\nthe campaign fund, but to control the party in other respects also. In\r\nall but two states registration is a prerequisite to voting. The\r\nintroduction into this country of the Australian ballot, and its rapid\r\nspread among the states after 1890, has made the ballot secret. By\r\npreventing the intimidation of the voter, and by otherwise\r\nsafeguarding his rights at the polls, ballot reform has remedied many\r\nabuses which formerly resulted in illegal and unrepresentative\r\nelections. Bribery and illegal voting are no longer glaring evils. It\r\nis now the general practice for state laws to provide definite polling\r\nplaces, and to guard the receiving and counting of the ballots.\r\n\r\n428. THE SPOILS SYSTEM.--During the first forty years of our national\r\nlife it was taken for granted that subordinate executive officials\r\nshould continue in office during good behavior, regardless of a change\r\nof administration. After President Jackson's first term, however, it\r\nbecame the general practice for the incoming party to use offices to\r\nreward party supporters. Senator Marcy's original declaration that \"to\r\nthe victor belongs the spoils,\" was accepted by both Democratic and\r\nRepublican parties. Each party, upon coming into power, habitually\r\nturned out appointive officials placed in office by the opposition\r\nparty. The positions thus made vacant were filled by individuals from\r\nthe ranks of the victorious party.\r\n\r\nThe spoils system is a serious evil for which party spirit must be\r\nheld accountable. By virtue of their patronage, party leaders have\r\nexercised an undue influence over the rank and file of the party.\r\nFrequently a candidate has been named for office, not because he\r\npossessed marked capacity for public service, but because he showed\r\npromise of being a good vote-getter at election time. Very frequently,\r\ntherefore, officeholders have secured their positions as the reward of\r\nparty support, rather than because of merit. The spoils system has\r\nencouraged the holders of executive offices to pay more attention to\r\nthe political fortunes of their party than to their public duties.\r\nKnowing that with a change of administration they would probably be\r\nousted to make room for the supporters of the rival party, officials\r\nhave been tempted to use public office for personal ends.\r\n\r\nThe spoils system still constitutes a defect in American government.\r\nNevertheless something has been done toward eliminating its worst\r\nfeatures. The Civil Service Act of 1883 provided that more than 12,000\r\nFederal executive offices should be filled by competitive examinations\r\nrather than by political appointment. The Federal Civil Service System\r\nhas been subsequently extended until at the present time about two\r\nthirds of the administrative offices in the Federal government are\r\nfilled on the merit plan. In many sections of the country the merit\r\nplan has also been used to fill state and municipal offices. Though as\r\nyet limited in scope, it would appear that the future will see a\r\nsteady expansion of the merit plan in local and state as well as in\r\nthe National government.\r\n\r\nThe essential feature of this system, whether in local, state or\r\nNational government, is that officeholders secure their positions on\r\nthe basis of individual merit. In theory at least, they are little\r\naffected by changes of administration. Both retention of office and\r\npromotion are on the basis of merit, though the standards by which\r\nappointees are judged have not yet been perfected.\r\n\r\n429. EXTENSION OF FAVORS TO SPECIAL INTERESTS.--The tendency of the\r\npolitical party to extend special favors to private corporations has\r\nconstituted a serious evil in American politics. In some instances\r\npowerful corporations have corrupted party politics; in other cases\r\nparty organizations have blackmailed corporations under the threat of\r\nunfriendly legislation; in many other cases both party and\r\ncorporations have been to blame. In every case, however, the essential\r\nfact is that often the party has been used for the advancement of\r\nspecial interests rather than to promote the general welfare.\r\nUnfavorable legislation has been bought off and favorable laws secured\r\nby trusts, public service corporations, and other large industrial\r\ninterests. Exemption from prosecution has been purchased by gambling\r\nhouses and other illegal businesses. Public service corporations have\r\nsecured valuable franchises for inadequate consideration. Contracts\r\nfor paving and other public works have many times been awarded, not to\r\nfirms offering the best work at the lowest price, but to incompetent\r\nor dishonest corporations. Such contracts have been secured by these\r\ncorporations because of favoritism shown them by political henchmen\r\nholding office under the spoils system.\r\n\r\nNotable headway has been made in checking these evils. The regulation\r\nof the railroads by the Interstate Commerce Commission renders it\r\ndifficult for railroad corporations unduly to influence party\r\npolicies. Anti-trust legislation has similarly checked the political\r\nactivities of other great industrial combinations. There is a growing\r\ntendency for states to pass laws forbidding or restricting the\r\nmaintenance of lobbies in legislative halls. Many recent state\r\nconstitutions narrowly restrict the franchise-granting power. Corrupt\r\npractices acts forbid party contributions from corporations. The Civil\r\nService System renders less easy the unfair award of government\r\ncontracts to private corporations.\r\n\r\n430. DECLINE OF PARTY ABUSES.--It is clear that the development of\r\nparty government in this country has been attended by important\r\nbenefits and serious evils. But the best authorities agree that the\r\nmerits of the party system outweigh its defects. Hence our problem is\r\nnot how to destroy the system, but how to regulate it so that we may\r\nsecure the benefit of its services and avoid the evil results of its\r\ndefects. The experience of the last half century is heartening, and it\r\nmust be admitted, not only that party abuses have declined, but that\r\nthere is good reason to believe that they will continue to decline. In\r\nour attitude toward the political party we must distinguish, as Burke\r\ndistinguished, between the legitimate form of the party and its\r\nperverted form. The perverted forms of party organization call for\r\ncensure and attack; the legitimate features of the party deserve our\r\nappreciation and support.\r\n\r\n431. DUTY OF PARTY SUPPORT.--Parties seem to be inevitable, for no one\r\nhas yet shown how representative government can be carried on without\r\nthem. Since the average voter cannot make his influence felt except\r\nthrough organization and mass action, it is, as a rule, as futile for\r\nthe individual to cast his vote regardless of party affiliations as it\r\nis for a soldier to fight without regard for army discipline and\r\norganization. Parties are the result of compromises, and the\r\nindividual must be willing to shelve minor issues for the sake of\r\nuniting with his fellows upon vital issues. Ordinarily, the individual\r\nwill best perform his civic duties by affiliating himself with some\r\npolitical party.\r\n\r\nBut we are coming to believe that the necessity of party support in\r\nNational and state elections does not imply that party support is\r\nnecessary in local elections. In National politics each party\r\ngenerally has a definite policy with regard to taxation, the tariff,\r\narmaments, and other debatable issues. Support of the party for the\r\nrealization of its program on these matters may be justifiable; on the\r\nother hand, loyalty to party in local politics may be an evil. There\r\nis no Democratic way of cleaning a street, and no Republican method of\r\nfighting a fire. Thus the same citizen who may be under a moral\r\nobligation to support some party in National and state politics, may\r\nbe under a similar obligation to make his choice of local candidates\r\nindependent of party. A desirable development, in this regard, is the\r\nrecent tendency for some municipal elections to be decided regardless\r\nof the party affiliations of the candidates.\r\n\r\n432. INTEGRITY IS ABOVE PARTY.--Young people are commonly advised to\r\naffiliate themselves with that political party which seems most\r\nadequately to express their political ideals. But though this is a\r\nmethod of conserving political energy, no citizen ought to support a\r\nparty which has ceased to represent him on matters which he considers\r\nof vital importance. When the party machine sets itself up as an end\r\nrather than a means, and when it emphasizes gain to a few rather than\r\nbenefits to the party as a whole, then it is time for honest men to\r\nabandon their party. Integrity is above party. The slogan, \"My party\r\nright or wrong\" is not only stupid but treasonable. Let the citizen be\r\neager to co÷perate with his fellows for the advancement of common\r\npolitical views, but let the corrupt party be abandoned.\r\n\r\n433. RESPONSIBILITY OF THE INDIVIDUAL FOR PARTY ABUSES.--Nothing\r\ncould be more mistaken than the belief that defective government is\r\ndue primarily to the existence of an entity known as the political\r\nparty. The party is merely an association of individuals, and if it is\r\ncorrupt it is so because of the corruption of the individuals\r\ncomprising it. It is time that political pessimists stopped blaming\r\nthe party for the defects of party government, and time they began to\r\nsee that the indifference and shortsightedness of the individual voter\r\nis at the bottom of the trouble. One of the greatest sources of\r\ncorruption in American life is the knowledge of political bosses that\r\nmany of their adherents will follow the party standard regardless of\r\nits platform and no matter what the character of its candidates. The\r\nparty boss is given an opening when individuals neglect to perform\r\ntheir civic duties. The failure to vote, or to serve in office when\r\nthe opportunity offers, the failure either to protest against\r\ncandidates chosen unfairly, or to demand an accounting of\r\nofficeholders, spell corruption and inefficiency in government.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS ON THE TEXT\r\n\r\n1.

THE PROBLEM.--In an important sense, good government is a matter\r\nof getting the right men into office, hence one of the most vital\r\nproblems in American democracy has to do with the choice of public\r\nofficials. In any representative democracy nominations and elections\r\nmust be a difficult and complex matter; in the United States the\r\nproblem is rendered doubly difficult by the great size of the country,\r\nand by the rapidity with which its population is increasing. In this\r\ncountry hundreds of thousands of public officials are placed in office\r\nannually, all of them either elected at the polls, or chosen by agents\r\nwho are themselves elected.\r\n\r\nThe problem before us involves four questions: First, how can we\r\nperfect the mechanism by means of which the officers of government are\r\nselected? Second, how can we elect officials who represent a\r\n_majority_, rather than a _plurality_ [Footnote: See Section 444.], of\r\nthose actually voting? Third, how can voters be helped to make\r\nintelligent choices at the polls? Fourth, how can we encourage\r\nqualified voters to make an habitual use of the ballot?\r\n\r\n435. NOMINATION BY CAUCUS.--One of the earliest methods of choosing\r\nparty candidates in this country was by means of the caucus. The\r\ncaucus was an informal meeting in which the local members of a\r\npolitical party nominated candidates for town and county offices.\r\nCandidates for state offices were named by a legislative caucus, in\r\nwhich legislators belonging to the same party came together and\r\ndetermined their respective nominations. The legislative caucus spread\r\nto all of the states, and in 1800 was transferred to Congress as a\r\nmode of nominating the President and Vice-President.\r\n\r\nAfter 1825 the caucus declined in importance. In the lawmaking\r\nbodies of both nation and states there continues to be a legislative\r\ncaucus, but its influence upon the choice of public officials has\r\ngreatly diminished. Outside of the state and National legislatures the\r\ncaucus is now found only in towns, wards, and other small areas. In\r\nthese areas it is used for the purpose of nominating candidates for\r\nlocal offices, and for the purpose of electing delegates to nominating\r\nconventions. Except in some parts of New England, it should be noted,\r\nthis local caucus is now generally known as the primary.\r\n\r\n436. RISE OF THE NOMINATING CONVENTION.--After 1825 the caucus was\r\nlargely superseded by the convention. The convention is a relatively\r\nlarge meeting of party delegates chosen for the express purpose of\r\ndeciding upon party policies and candidates. The convention device was\r\ndeveloped, partly because party bosses had come to dominate the\r\ncaucus, and partly because the increasing population of the country\r\nnecessitated larger congregations of party members. The convention was\r\nmade possible by improved means of transportation, which allowed\r\nrelatively large groups of individuals to come together for\r\ndeliberative purposes. By 1850 all of the political parties had\r\nadopted the convention plan for the nomination of candidates for most\r\nlocal, state, and National offices.\r\n\r\n437. DECLINE OF THE CONVENTION.--The convention was an improvement\r\nupon the caucus in that it allowed a greater number of party members\r\nto participate in nominations. Unfortunately, delegates to the\r\nconvention continued to be chosen in local caucuses, where the party\r\n\"ring\" or machine usually determined the choice of delegates. Bosses\r\nprepared \"slates,\" bribed delegates, and otherwise manipulated what\r\nwas supposed to be an expression of the party will in convention. In\r\nmany cases the convention became-merely a cut-and-dried affair in\r\nwhich party members ratified nominations previously agreed upon by\r\nparty leaders.\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of the nineteenth century, and especially after\r\n1900, these defects stimulated the development of measures designed to\r\nreduce or eliminate the abuses of the convention system. The most\r\nimportant of these reform measures is the Direct Primary.\r\n\r\n438. NATURE OF THE DIRECT PRIMARY.--The terms caucus, primary, and\r\ndirect primary are easily confused. We have seen that the local caucus\r\nis now generally known as the primary. The essential difference\r\nbetween this caucus or primary and the Direct Primary is this: in the\r\nDirect Primary, party members vote directly for the party's candidates\r\nat the forthcoming election; in the caucus or primary, on the other\r\nhand, party members do not vote directly for the more important of\r\nthese candidates, but instead vote for delegates to a convention.\r\nLater these delegates meet in convention and there vote directly for\r\nparty candidates. Thus the Direct Primary is really an election within\r\nthe party, held for the purpose of allowing party members to choose\r\nthe candidates who will represent the party at the approaching regular\r\nelection. When adopted, the Direct Primary abolishes the convention by\r\nallowing party members to cast their ballots directly for their\r\nparty's candidates. Those individuals are nominated who receive a\r\nplurality of all votes cast.\r\n\r\nIn most states the Direct Primary has recently been placed under\r\ndetailed legal control. Such laws generally prescribe the time and\r\nplace of holding the Direct Primary, the qualifications of those who\r\nmay participate, and the organization and general management of this\r\nparty election. There is provision for polling places, official\r\nballots, and election of officials, just as there is provision for\r\nsimilar machinery in the regular election which follows the Direct\r\nPrimary.\r\n\r\n439. EXTENT OF THE DIRECT PRIMARY.--Heralded as a cure for the defects\r\nof the convention, the Direct Primary spread rapidly after 1900. By\r\n1919 every state in the Union had adopted it in some form, and about\r\nforty states were applying the state-wide primary. At first the Direct\r\nPrimary was used only to nominate candidates for local offices, but at\r\nthe present time state officers, and even Federal Senators and\r\nRepresentatives, are often nominated by this method. In more than a\r\nthird of the states the voters at the Direct Primary are allowed to\r\nexpress their preference directly for one of the candidates for the\r\npresidential nomination. Altogether, the Direct Primary has largely\r\nsupplanted the convention in about three fourths of the states.\r\n\r\n440. ADVANTAGES CLAIMED FOR THE DIRECT PRIMARY.--A number of important\r\nadvantages are claimed for the Direct Primary. It is said that the\r\ndevice reduces the power of the party boss, and insures democratic\r\ncontrol within the party. Party members are more interested in the\r\nDirect Primary than in the local caucus or primary because in the\r\nDirect Primary they actually aid in the direct selection of party\r\ncandidates. The local caucus or primary, on the other hand, does not\r\ndirectly select the more important party candidates, but can only\r\nchoose delegates to a nominating convention. Because the Direct\r\nPrimary increases the control of the individual over party policies,\r\nit encourages active political work on the part of the rank and file.\r\nIt is maintained that the Direct Primary brings out a larger vote than\r\nwould otherwise be possible. Better candidates are secured by means of\r\nthe Direct Primary, it is claimed, because the nomination of\r\nindividuals depends upon the presentation of their claims to the\r\nvoters, rather than upon winning the favor of party bosses.\r\n\r\n441. OBJECTIONS URGED AGAINST THE DIRECT PRIMARY.--The opponents of\r\nthe plan claim that the Direct Primary has serious faults. It is said\r\nthat in supplanting the convention the Direct Primary has made more\r\ndifficult the exchange of views and opinions among party members. It\r\nis declared that the Direct Primary has disorganized the party and has\r\ntherefore broken down party responsibility. It is claimed that the\r\nDirect Primary has not eliminated the boss, for rather than voting\r\ndirectly for candidates of their own choice, electors must make a\r\nselection from a list of candidates previously arranged by party\r\nleaders. All of these candidates may be objectionable to the voter. It\r\nis also pointed out that many worthy candidates have not the money to\r\ndefray the expense of competing in the Direct Primaries. Frequently\r\nthe \"ring\" brings out a number of candidates to divide the voters,\r\nwhile the henchmen of the ring concentrate their votes upon one\r\nman. Lastly, it is pointed out, the excessive number of candidates to\r\nbe selected renders it impossible for the average individual to make\r\nan intelligent selection. In such a case, the average individual\r\nattends the Direct Primary only to confirm the choice of party\r\nleaders.\r\n\r\n442. OUTLOOK FOR THE DIRECT PRIMARY.--Although there is much to be\r\nsaid for and against the Direct Primary, the belief is gaining ground\r\nthat this device does not offer the final solution of the difficulty\r\nwhich led to its establishment. After an exhaustive study of the\r\nsubject, Professor Munro concludes as follows: \"In a word, the primary\r\nseems to afford protection against the worst fault of the convention,\r\nwhich was the frequent selection of incapable and corrupt candidates\r\nat the behest of a few political leaders. But it has not, in twenty\r\nyears or more of experience, demonstrated that it can achieve positive\r\nresults of a measurably satisfactory character. It has not rid the\r\nstate of boss domination; it has increased the expense which every\r\ncandidate must incur, and it gives a marked advantage to the man whose\r\nname is well known to the voters, whether he be a professional\r\npolitician or not. To say that the primary secures on the average\r\nsomewhat better results than the old convention may be stating the\r\ntruth, but it is not high praise.\"\r\n\r\n443. NOMINATION BY PETITION.--The system of nomination by petition\r\ncame into use between 1880 and 1890. It provides that candidates may\r\nbe placed in nomination by filing with some specified officer\r\nnomination papers, or petitions, signed by a specified number of\r\nqualified voters. The filing of these papers entitles the candidates\r\nnamed thereon to have their names printed upon the official ballot.\r\nThe merit of this device is that it prevents the party machine from\r\ndictating the choice of candidates, and that it enables independent\r\ncandidates to be brought forward. On the other hand, it has encouraged\r\nthe circulation of petitions for hire.\r\n\r\nOn the whole this method of nomination is proving more and more\r\npopular in local elections. It seems well adapted to the needs of\r\nmunicipalities, for it reduces partisanship to a minimum. It is said\r\nthat in some cases it practically eliminates national politics from\r\nlocal elections. The supporters of nomination by petition are\r\nincreasing, and it is now proposed to apply it to all local and state\r\nnominations. In such an event the Direct Primary would be radically\r\nmodified, or even abolished.\r\n\r\n 444. MAJORITY REPRESENTATION.--How can we make certain that an\r\nindividual nominated or elected represents a majority of those voting?\r\nWhen there are only two candidates, the one receiving the largest\r\nnumber of votes receives both a plurality and a majority. But when\r\nthere are several candidates, it often happens that the individual\r\nreceiving the largest number of votes does not receive a majority.\r\nSuppose, for example, that 100,000 votes are cast, and that A receives\r\n20,000, B 25,000 C 30,000 and D 25,000. Ordinarily C will be declared\r\nsuccessful because he has received a _plurality_ of the votes cast.\r\nBut he has not received a _majority_ of the votes cast. This custom of\r\ndeclaring successful the candidate receiving a plurality constitutes a\r\ndefect in our representative system, since a plurality candidate may\r\nrepresent only a small minority of those actually voting.\r\n\r\nSeveral attempts have been made to remedy this defect. In some\r\nsouthern states it is the practice to require an absolute majority for\r\nelection. If no aspirant receives a majority, a second ballot is taken\r\non the two candidates standing highest on the list. In a number of\r\nnorthern cities, the evil of plurality voting has been attacked\r\nthrough the _preferential voting_ device. This system of voting allows\r\nthe voter to designate not only his first, but his second and third\r\nchoices as well. If any candidate receives a clear majority of first\r\nchoice votes, he is declared elected. But if no one receives such a\r\nmajority, the second choices are added to the first choices. If this\r\nfurther calculation does not give any candidate a majority, third\r\nchoices are resorted to. In cities where the plan has been tried,\r\npreferential voting is said to have proved markedly successful.\r\n\r\n445. MINORITY REPRESENTATION.--Related to the question of making sure\r\nthat successful candidates represent a majority of those voting is the\r\nproblem of the adequate representation of the minority. The most\r\nnotorious phase of this problem has grown out of our custom of\r\nelecting one national Representative from each of the congressional\r\ndistricts into which every state is divided. Often gerrymandering\r\n[Footnote: The origin and nature of \"gerrymandering\" are discussed in\r\nChapter XLII, Sections 542 and 543.] is resorted to, that is to say,\r\ncongressional districts are so arranged as to give the minority party\r\noverwhelming majorities in a few districts, while the dominant party\r\nis allowed to carry the remaining districts by very small majorities.\r\nThe result is gross misrepresentation in Congress, because the party\r\nhaving a bare majority often secures a large percentage of the\r\nrepresentatives, while the minority is very inadequately represented.\r\n\r\nSuch misrepresentation also appears in connection with the choice of\r\nrepresentatives to the state legislatures.\r\n\r\nIn the attempt to remedy this type of misrepresentation various plans\r\nof _proportional representation_ have been put forth. In Illinois\r\nmembers of the lower house of the state legislature have long been\r\nchosen as follows: Each state senatorial district is given the right\r\nto elect three assemblymen. Every elector in the district has the\r\nright to cast three votes, one each for three different persons, or\r\ntwo votes for one candidate and one for another, or all for one\r\ncandidate. By concentrating its votes upon one candidate, an average\r\nminority can be sure of at least one representative in each district.\r\nA plan employed in several other states likewise aims to give each\r\npolitical party representation proportional to the number of votes\r\ncast by the party, regardless of whether the number is a minority or a\r\nmajority. The principle of proportional representation, if fully\r\nworked out, and if made simple enough to be comprehended by the\r\naverage voter, would insure majority rule and at the same time allow\r\nthe adequate representation of minorities.\r\n\r\n446. OBSTACLES TO INTELLIGENTY VOTING.--Several obstacles to\r\nintelligent voting in this country are intimately connected with the\r\nlong ballot. [Footnote: The term \"long ballot\" refers to the fact that\r\nso many officials are elective that the ballot on which their names\r\nappear is often of great length. The term \"short ballot\" refers to a\r\nreduction of the length of this ballot by making fewer officers\r\nelective.] The wave of democracy which swept the country in the last\r\ncentury had the double effect of increasing the number of elective\r\noffices, and of shortening the terms during which officials were\r\nallowed to hold office. A greatly lengthened ballot, together with the\r\ngreat frequency of elections, has made it impossible for the average\r\nvoter to exercise proper judgment at the polls. The difficulty of\r\ninvestigating the merits of the numerous candidates, or even of\r\nbecoming familiar with their names, has discouraged many from voting.\r\nOf those who still pretend to reach independent decisions regarding\r\ncandidates and issues, a considerable number really rely upon the\r\ndirection and advice of professional politicians. The long ballot is\r\nthe enemy of democracy, since it allows politicians, rather than the\r\nmasses, to control actual government.\r\n\r\n447. SHORTENING THE BALLOT.--The chief remedy for these evils is the\r\nshort ballot. The essential features of the short ballot plan are as\r\nfollows: Popular elections should be resorted to only for the purpose\r\nof choosing those officials who have to do with public policies. For\r\nexample, state voters ought to select only the governor, lieutenant\r\ngovernor, and members of the legislature; city voters ought to choose\r\nonly the mayor and council; [Footnote: Where this form of municipal\r\ngovernment is still employed.] while county voters ought to confine\r\ntheir attention to a small group of county commissioners or\r\nsupervisors. All other officials ought to be appointed, either\r\ndirectly by chief executive officers, or by means of the merit plan.\r\nAlong with the shortening of the ballot, we should be increasingly\r\nwilling to allow officials to hold office for longer terms. A\r\nsupplementary feature of great value would be the establishment of\r\nsuch means of popular control as would protect the public against\r\nabuse of power by officials to whom these longer terms had been\r\nextended.\r\n\r\n448. MERITS OF THE SHORT BALLOT.--There can be little doubt that a\r\ndrastic shortening of the ballot would work a great improvement in our\r\nelectoral system. If the vast majority of officials were made\r\nappointive, the voter could give more time and thought to the\r\nconsideration of a few important elective officials. A short ballot\r\nwould lessen the possibilities of manipulation by rings and bosses.\r\nUnquestionably the interest of the voter would be quickened, since his\r\ninfluence upon the political life of his community would be more\r\napparent. And not only would the short ballot make government more\r\nrepresentative, but it would help to make it more responsible.\r\n\r\nIf the majority of the administrative officials who are now elected\r\nwere made appointive, responsibility for their conduct in office could\r\nbe concentrated upon the chief executive officer appointing them.\r\n\r\n449. THE NEGLECT TO VOTE.--The last of the vital questions arising in\r\nconnection with the choice of public officials is the matter of\r\nencouraging the enfranchised classes to use the ballot. The long\r\nballot and the domination of party politics by rings and bosses\r\ndiscourage many from voting, nevertheless it is probably true that the\r\nslackness of the individual is the chief reason why voters neglect to\r\nuse the ballot. This slackness may take the form of personal\r\nindolence, or of indifference to civic duty, or of preoccupation with\r\nthe press of personal business. When individuals are busy with their\r\nprivate affairs the time needed for intelligent political action is\r\noften begrudged. Again, the duty to vote is not always a compelling\r\none. When a duty is shared with innumerable other people, it appears\r\nless of a personal duty; when the individual notes that his fellow-\r\ncitizens neglect that duty, his own tendency toward slackness is\r\nencouraged. In a democracy, as Lord Bryce points out, \"everybody's\r\nbusiness becomes nobody's business.\"\r\n\r\n450. IMPORTANCE OF CIVIC EDUCATION.--The perfecting of our nominating\r\nand elective machinery, together with the shortening of the ballot, is\r\ndoing a good deal to awaken interest in the proper use of the vote.\r\nBut the problems of democracy cannot be solved by purely mechanical\r\nmeans. If our voters are to regard the use of the ballot as a civic\r\nduty, we must rely largely upon civic education. Young people, soon to\r\nbe voters, must be impressed with the responsibilities of democracy.\r\nThey must be taught the vital importance of using the vote. In Belgium\r\nand Spain it is customary to penalize individuals for neglecting to\r\nvote, but the idea of compulsory voting is repugnant to the American\r\nspirit. Moreover, law alone can neither build up nor sustain\r\nindividual morality. The remedy for indifference to the ballot would\r\nseem to be not law, but the education of voters to their moral\r\nobligation toward the government under which they live.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS ON THE TEXT\r\n\r\n1.

MAGNITUDE OF THE PROBLEM.--How can we insure the honest and\r\nefficient administration of American government? Civic education and\r\nthe perfection of nomination and election devices will do much toward\r\nsecuring this end, but there remains a troublesome question. This has\r\nto do with reorganizing our legislative and administrative machinery,\r\nso that public officials may be allowed or encouraged to perform their\r\nduties in a responsible and effective manner.\r\n\r\nThe problem is a vast one, the adequate treatment of which would\r\nrequire volumes. In this chapter, therefore, it will be necessary to\r\nconfine the discussion to a few of the more pressing aspects of the\r\nproblem. Of these the following are perhaps the more important: First,\r\nthe defects in legislative procedure; second, the reorganization of\r\nstate administration; third, budget reform; and fourth, the reform of\r\nmunicipal government.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. DEFECTS IN LEGISLATIVE PROCEDURE\r\n\r\n452. AMERICAN LEGISLATURES ARE OVERWORKED.--It has frequently been\r\npointed out that in the United States both state and National\r\nlegislatures are overwhelmed with work. One reason for this is that\r\nthe extension of government control over industrial corporations has\r\nrendered legislation more complex and greater in volume. The\r\ndevelopment of public interest in health, education, and related\r\nfields has 'of recent years markedly increased the amount of\r\nlegislation. The custom which many legislators have of attempting to\r\nget as much special legislation for their respective districts as\r\npossible has likewise increased the number of laws upon the statute\r\nbooks. Lastly, it should be borne in mind that throughout our history\r\nwe have tended to believe legislation a cure-all for the defects of\r\nAmerican life. This attitude has led to an excessive number of laws on\r\nsubjects which in European countries are ordinarily left to the\r\ndiscretion of administrative officials.\r\n\r\nThe combined effect of these developments has been to confront our\r\nlegislatures with so much business that honest and efficient\r\nlegislation has been rendered exceedingly difficult.\r\n\r\n453 THE COMMITTEE SYSTEM.--The chief defects of American legislation\r\nappear in connection with the committee system which exists in both\r\nNational and state legislatures. The committee system is the practice\r\nof dividing the legislative body into a large number of small groups\r\nor committees whose duty it is to consider various types of\r\nlegislative business. The great merit of this device is that it\r\nexpedites business. Indeed, the membership of our legislatures has\r\nbecome so large, and the amount of legislative business has increased\r\nso rapidly, that it is difficult to see how the committee system could\r\nbe dispensed with. Without some such division of labor, chaos and\r\nendless delay would result. [Footnote: For the part played by the\r\ncommittee system in the actual making of a law, see Chapter XLIIL]\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the committee system has numerous faults. As Lord\r\nBryce has pointed out, it destroys the unity of the legislature by\r\nbreaking it up into a number of small groups among which there is no\r\nappreciable degree of co÷rdination. The committee system limits\r\ndebate. Since most committee business is transacted in secret session,\r\nthe public is deprived of light upon public affairs. So minutely does\r\nthe committee system divide legislative labor that even the most\r\nimportant piece of legislation cannot secure the attention of the best\r\nmen. There is a diffusion of responsibility when various committees\r\nwork upon related problems without regard for the work being done by\r\none another. Finally, the committee system throws power, unaccompanied\r\nby adequate responsibility, into the hands of the committee chairman.\r\n\r\n454 LOG-ROLLING. Log-rolling is the trading of votes among individual\r\nlegislators. Many of the faults of our state and National legislatures\r\nare connected with this practice. Some legislators are so intent upon\r\nsecuring the passage of bills in which they are personally interested\r\nthat they are willing to vote for a fellow-legislator's pet bills,\r\nregardless of merit, provided that legislator will return the favor.\r\nIn this way special legislation often displaces bills which are drawn\r\nin a wider interest,--taxation, education, and other vital matters\r\nbeing neglected so that members may pursue personal ends.\r\n\r\nThere is as yet no limit to the number of bills which may be\r\nintroduced by state or National legislators. As a result there is a\r\nlarge number of unnecessary and hastily framed bills for which no one\r\nis definitely responsible. It is supposed to be the duty of all\r\nlegislators to weed out bills which are poorly framed, or which are\r\ndesigned to promote special interests. But in this case everybody's\r\nbusiness becomes nobody's business. Such machine-like formalities as\r\nrepeated readings of a bill, and a series of committee reports upon\r\nit, are generally substituted for individual scrutiny of a measure.\r\n\r\n455. LEGISLATIVE REFORM.--The reform of legislative procedure is\r\nattracting an increasing amount of attention among students of\r\nAmerican politics. Many recent state constitutions define in detail\r\nthe powers and procedure of the state legislature. A considerable\r\nnumber of states now have legislative reference bureaus, which enable\r\nlegislators to keep track of legislation in other states, as well as\r\nto have ready access to important data bearing upon their own\r\nproblems. There is a growing tendency for state legislatures to employ\r\nexpert bill drafters to draw up laws on technical and highly-complex\r\nsubjects. The expert bill drafter and the legislative bureau help\r\nmaterially to reduce the amount of defective and unwise legislation on\r\nthe statute books.\r\n\r\nMuch remains to be done, however. Important public bills ought\r\ninvariably to be given first consideration by legislators, instead of,\r\nas is still many times the case, being put off until the end of the\r\nsession in order to allow time for log-rolling. Filibustering and\r\nother time-wasting tactics should be curbed, because they tend to\r\nobstruct legislation. Many students of government advocate the\r\nextension of a plan already adopted in Massachusetts and a few other\r\nstates, whereby all bills are given a public hearing. It is also clear\r\nthat some method ought to be devised whereby the work of the various\r\ncommittees dealing with related subjects could be correlated and\r\nharmonized. Lastly, any measures which will reduce the amount of\r\nunnecessary and ill-advised legislation must prove of great value.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. THE REORGANIZATION OF STATE ADMINISTRATION\r\n\r\n456. DEFECTS IN STATE ADMINISTRATION.--Originally the state\r\nadministration consisted of the Governor and a few elective officers,\r\nnotably a Secretary of State, a Treasurer, and an Attorney-General.\r\nWith the rapid development of the country, education, health,\r\ndependency, corporations, and similar matters have required more and\r\nmore attention from state governments. To perform a host of new\r\nfunctions the state administration has expanded to include numerous\r\ncommissioners, boards, and departments, some of them elected by the\r\npeople, and some of them appointed by the Governor.\r\n\r\nThis development has been haphazard, rather than orderly and planned.\r\nAs a result, the administrative department is in most states a\r\nconfused and tangled mass of boards and commissions, departments and\r\nsingle offices, often duplicating the work of one another, and largely\r\nworking without any appreciable degree of co÷rdination. In most states\r\nnumerous administrative officers are elective, rather than appointive.\r\nThis situation has two drawbacks: In the first place elective\r\nofficials are responsible to no one but the people at large, and\r\ntherefore these officials cannot be _efficiently directed or\r\nsupervised_ by the Governor. In the second place, no definite person\r\nor persons can be held _responsible_ for the conduct of this numerous\r\nbody of elective administrative officials.\r\n\r\n457. THE REFORM OF STATE ADMINISTRATION.--The reorganization and\r\nconsolidation of state administrative offices is attracting an\r\nincreasing amount of attention. In New Jersey, Massachusetts,\r\nIllinois, and several other states, administration has been notably\r\nsimplified and systematized. The Illinois Administrative Code of 1917,\r\nfor example, consolidated the work of more than a hundred\r\nadministrative offices into nine main departments. Each department is\r\nin charge of a director, appointed by the Governor, and each\r\ndepartment is responsible to the Governor. Co÷rdination of this type\r\neconomizes time and energy, and saves the state's money by reducing\r\nthe number of salaried officials. The centralization of the entire\r\nadministration under the Governor not only allows efficient\r\nsupervision, but permits the people to hold this official strictly\r\naccountable for the administration.\r\n\r\nThe need of reform in state administration is recognized throughout\r\nthe Union, but in most states the reorganization of administrative\r\noffices is retarded in two ways: First, the movement is opposed by\r\nofficeholders who fear that their positions will be abolished by a\r\nconsolidation of departments; second, in many states the consolidation\r\nof administrative offices is impossible without substantial amendments\r\nto the state constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\nC. BUDGET REFORM\r\n\r\n458. THE QUESTION OF A BUDGET.--In contrast to the leading countries\r\nof Europe, our National government until very recently had no budget\r\nsystem. Some of the estimates were prepared by the administrative\r\ndepartments, under the direction of the President, while other\r\nestimates were prepared by various committees in the House of\r\nRepresentatives. In Congress there was little or no co÷rdination\r\nbetween the various committees considering different appropriations.\r\nNor were these committees properly co÷rdinated with the administrative\r\ndepartments which were responsible for the original estimates.\r\n\r\nAfter appropriations had been granted, Congress had no scrutiny over\r\nthe actual expenditure of the money. Thus the administrative\r\ndepartments might waste their appropriations, and then secure the\r\npassage of deficiency bills to make up the shortage. At no time did\r\nthe various departments and committees considering appropriations take\r\ninto careful account the amount of government revenue. For this reason\r\nit was purely an accident if appropriations kept within the limits set\r\nby available revenue.\r\n\r\nA similar situation formerly prevailed in many of the states. The\r\nvarious administrative departments transmitted to the legislature an\r\nestimate of what each required for the coming year. These estimates,\r\ntogether with an unlimited number of appropriation bills introduced by\r\nindividual members, were referred to various committees. Whether\r\nparticular appropriations were granted depended, not upon the amount\r\nof state revenue, but upon the political pressure brought to bear in\r\nfavor of those measures. As in Congress, neither the executive nor\r\nlegislative branch of government, neither particular committees nor\r\nindividual legislators, could be held wholly responsible for any\r\nappropriation measure. Excessive waste of public funds was the result.\r\n\r\n459. BUDGET REFORM.--The last two decades have witnessed a growing\r\ndemand for a national budget. Under the direction of President Taft a\r\ncommission investigated the general question of responsibility in the\r\nhandling of Federal finances. The report of the committee favored a\r\nnational budget, but the unfriendly attitude of Congress checked the\r\nmovement. Interest in a national budget increased during the two terms\r\nof President Wilson, stimulated, especially, by the wave of postwar\r\neconomy which swept the country after the signing of the armistice in\r\nNovember, 1918. In the spring of 1921, a bill establishing a budget\r\nsystem for the National government passed both houses of Congress, and\r\non June 10, 1921, the bill became law by the signature of President\r\nHarding. This system is expected markedly to improve Federal finances.\r\n\r\nPractically unknown a few years ago, the budget movement among the\r\nstates has spread so rapidly that at the present time almost all of\r\nthe commonwealths have some sort of budget system. Three methods of\r\npreparing the budget are found among the several states. In some\r\nstates, as in New York, budget-making is in the hands of the\r\nlegislature; in other states, as in Wisconsin, both legislature and\r\nexecutive participate in budget-making; in still other states, as\r\nin Illinois, the executive alone is responsible for the preparation of\r\nthe budget. Many authorities claim that the last-named type of budget\r\npreparation is preferable but, in many states it is objected to as\r\ngiving too much power to the executive.\r\n\r\n\r\nD. THE REFORM OF MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\n460. MUNICIPAL REFORM: CHANGES IN THE MAYOR-COUNCIL PLAN.--Until the\r\nopening of the twentieth century practically every American city was\r\ngoverned under what is known as the mayor-council plan. This plan\r\nprovides for a council to make the laws, and a mayor to act as\r\nexecutive. Formerly the council of the larger cities was very often\r\ncomposed of two chambers, a board of aldermen and a common council,\r\nbut of late years the single-chambered council has become more and\r\nmore common.\r\n\r\nThe mayor-council plan still prevails in most American cities,\r\nparticularly in the larger municipalities. But everywhere the growing\r\ndemand for honesty and efficiency in government is leading to the\r\nreform of this system. In order to reduce the length of the ballot,\r\nthe appointive power of the mayor is being increased. In the interests\r\nof economy and responsibility the administrative offices are in many\r\ncities being consolidated, co÷rdinated and centralized under the\r\nmayor. To guard against the abuse of financial power there is in many\r\ncommonwealths a tendency for state constitutions and statutes to limit\r\nthe debt-incurring and franchise-granting powers of city councils.\r\n\r\n461. MUNICIPAL REFORM: THE COMMISSION PLAN.--In September, 1900, a\r\ntidal wave seriously demoralized the mayor-council form of government\r\nin Galveston, Texas. To meet the emergency, the state legislature\r\nauthorized the establishment of a new type of government, known as the\r\ncommission plan. Instead of selecting a mayor and councilmen, the\r\nvoters of Galveston now choose a commission of five officials. All of\r\nthese commissioners are equal in power, except that one presides as\r\nmayor-president. The commission form of government spread rapidly,\r\nchiefly among the smaller cities, until in 1921 there were more than\r\n300 municipalities governed under this plan. In every case the\r\ncommission has both legislative and executive powers. Collectively the\r\ncommissioners act as a legislative body for the city, individually\r\nthey head the various administrative departments.\r\n\r\nA number of important advantages are claimed for the commission form\r\nof city government. Responsibility is no longer divided among mayor\r\nand councilmen, but can be definitely placed upon the small group of\r\ncommissioners. It is believed by many that commission government\r\nallows a greater harmony of action than is possible under the mayor-\r\ncouncil plan. Finally, it is declared, a group of five or seven\r\ncommissioners can administer city government with more efficiency than\r\ncan a mayor and a numerous council.\r\n\r\nThe opponents of commission government maintain, on the other hand,\r\nthat the plan is undemocratic and oligarchical because it centralizes\r\ngreat power in the hands of a small group. The plan is said to\r\nincrease the danger of corruption, since appropriating and spending\r\npowers are placed in the same hands. The opponents of this form of\r\ngovernment also maintain that it renders easier the corruption of the\r\ncity administration, since party bosses may easily gain control of a\r\nfew commissioners. A final, and perhaps the most serious, objection is\r\nthat commission government does not go to the logical conclusion in\r\nconcentrating responsibility. There is no head to the administration,\r\nand no way of preventing the diffusion of responsibility among the\r\ncommissioners. Jealousy among the commissioners has often led to\r\nfriction and to working at cross-purposes. [Footnote: Of recent years\r\na number of cities have abandoned commission government for either the\r\nmayor-council or the city manager plan.]\r\n\r\n462. MUNICIPAL REFORM: THE CITY MANAGER PLAN.--A recent modification\r\nof commission government is the city manager plan. This provides for a\r\nsmall elective commission, which does not itself administer the\r\ngovernment of the city, but which chooses, instead, an experienced\r\nexecutive or city manager. The city manager is supposed to be a non-\r\npartisan expert whose duty it is to administer the city in accordance\r\nwith business principles. As the agent of the commission choosing him,\r\nthe city manager enforces all ordinances, prepares annual estimates,\r\nand appoints all other city officials and employees. He also accepts\r\nfull responsibility for the administration of the city's affairs.\r\n\r\nThe first city to apply the city manager plan was Dayton, Ohio, which\r\nbegan the experiment on January 1, 1914. Since that date the plan, or\r\nsome variation of it, has been established in about a hundred cities.\r\nThe city manager plan is an improvement over the commission plan, in\r\nthat it allows a greater concentration of responsibility. Another\r\nadvantage over commission government is that the city manager plan\r\ninsures a high grade of professional skill at the apex of the city's\r\nadministration. The plan appears to work well in the smaller cities,\r\nprovided a high grade manager can be found, and provided, also, that\r\nhis position can be safeguarded against corrupting political\r\ninfluences.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS ON THE TEXT\r\n\r\n1.

BASIS OF POPULAR CONTROL.--The fact that our government is a\r\nrepresentative democracy entitles the voters to choose, direct, and\r\ncontrol the public officials who act for the people at large. We have\r\ndiscussed a few of the methods whereby the nomination and election\r\nmachinery might be improved; we must now go a step further and examine\r\nthe means by which officeholders may be controlled.\r\n\r\nSupposedly, officials are chosen because the people believe them able\r\nand willing to discharge public duties with honesty and efficiency.\r\nBut after officials have taken office it may develop that they have\r\nsecured their positions by unfair means, or that they are dishonest,\r\nor that they are inefficient or otherwise unsatisfactory. Wherever it\r\ndevelops that officeholders no longer meet with the approval of the\r\npeople, truly representative government is impossible unless some\r\nmethod of effective popular control is found.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. INDIRECT METHODS OF CONTROL\r\n\r\n464. REFUSAL TO RE╦LECT.--If the voters are dissatisfied with the\r\nconduct of their representatives, they may express their disapproval\r\nby refusing to reŰlect those representatives. This effects a measure\r\nof control, even though it is negative and not immediate.\r\n\r\n465. REMOVAL BY THE APPOINTIVE AUTHORITY.--If satisfaction is not\r\nrendered by subordinate administrative officials who have secured\r\noffice through appointment, such officials may be removed from office\r\nby the authority appointing them. The power of the President,\r\nGovernor, or mayor to appoint generally carries with it the power\r\nto remove from office. Such removal may be on the initiative of the\r\nappointing authority, or it may be in response to a popular demand.\r\nFrom the standpoint of the voters at large, however, this method of\r\nremoval is indirect and often ineffective.\r\n\r\n466. IMPEACHMENT.--Unsatisfactory officials are sometimes removed by\r\nthe impeachment process. In the various states either a part or the\r\nwhole of the legislature may sit as a court of impeachment for the\r\ntrial of certain important officials accused of serious crime. In the\r\nNational government the House of Representatives may initiate\r\nimpeachment proceedings against the President, Vice-President, and all\r\nother civil officers of the United States. In such cases the Senate\r\nacts as a court of trial.\r\n\r\nYet as a method of popular control impeachment is unsatisfactory. It\r\nis indirect, since a part or the whole of the legislature acts for the\r\npeople. It is slow and cumbersome. It does not extend over the entire\r\nlist of public officials, nor over the entire range of offenses.\r\n\r\n467. CONTROL THROUGH THE AMENDING PROCESS.--The powers and duties of\r\npublic officials may be partially controlled through the formal\r\namending process. In all states except New Hampshire the constitution\r\nmay be amended through legislative action, subsequently ratified by\r\npopular vote. About two thirds of the states also provide for\r\namendment by a constitutional convention composed of delegates elected\r\nby the voters. In a number of states, as we shall see a little later,\r\nconstitutional amendment may also be secured by means of the\r\nInitiative and Referendum.\r\n\r\nThe Federal Constitution may be formally amended in four different\r\nways. The two most important methods are, first, by a two-thirds vote\r\nin each house of Congress, and second, by a convention called by\r\nCongress upon application of the legislatures of two thirds of the\r\nstates. In either case the amendment must be ratified by the\r\nlegislatures of three fourths of the states.\r\n\r\nThe formal amending process is an important part of our governmental\r\nmachinery, but as a method of popular control it is open to a number\r\nof criticisms. It is slow. It is indirect, for the people must rely\r\nchiefly upon their legislatures. Constitutional amendment cannot\r\nremedy all of the abuses of office. Furthermore, it is too drastic and\r\nfar-reaching a remedy for many of the minor abuses of office.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. DIRECT METHODS or CONTROL\r\n\r\n468. THE INITIATIVE.--In more than a third of the states popular\r\ndiscontent with the state legislature, together with the growing self-\r\nconfidence of the voters, has led to the adoption of the Initiative.\r\nThe Initiative is a device whereby any person or group of persons may\r\ndraft a statute, and, on securing the signatures of a certain\r\npercentage of the voters, compel the state officials to submit the\r\nmeasure to popular vote. If at this voting the measure secures the\r\nrequired popular approval, it becomes law.\r\n\r\nWhen the measure is submitted to the voters directly after the\r\nfulfilment of the petition requirements, the device is known as the\r\nDirect Initiative. When, after passing the petition stage, the measure\r\ngoes to the legislature and does not come before the people at the\r\npolls unless the legislature fails to accept it, the device is known\r\nas the Indirect Initiative. In a dozen states, chiefly in the West,\r\nthe Initiative is also used to propose amendments to the state\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\n469. THE REFERENDUM.--Early in our national history, it became an\r\nestablished principle that proposed constitutions or constitutional\r\namendments should be referred to the voters for ratification. Of\r\nrecent years about a third of the states, chiefly in the West, have\r\nextended the referendum device to cover ordinary legislation. This\r\ntype of referendum may be defined as a plan whereby a small percentage\r\nof the voters may demand that practically any statute passed by the\r\nlegislature must be submitted to the voters and approved by a\r\nspecified majority before going into effect. [Footnote: A few types of\r\nlaws are not subject to the Referendum.]\r\n\r\nThe Referendum is variously applied. In the Compulsory Referendum,\r\nwhich is the most common form, a measure must be submitted to the\r\npeople whenever a designated number of voters petition that this step\r\nbe taken. The Optional Referendum allows the state legislature to\r\ndecide whether or not an enacted measure should be submitted to the\r\npeople. The Statutory Referendum applies only to proposed statutes,\r\nwhile the Constitutional Referendum is limited to proposed amendments\r\nto the state constitution.\r\n\r\n470. DIRECT LEGISLATION.--The Initiative and the Referendum are found\r\ntogether in more than a dozen states. The two devices are\r\nsupplementary: the Initiative is a positive instrument which may be\r\nused to set the wheels of direct legislation in motion; the Referendum\r\nis a negative measure which gives the people a potential veto on laws\r\npassed by the legislature. The Initiative and the Referendum are known\r\ncollectively as Direct Legislation, that is, legislation directly by\r\nthe people, as opposed to legislation enacted entirely through the\r\nlegislature.\r\n\r\n471. ADVANTAGES CLAIMED FOR DIRECT LEGISLATION.--Important advantages\r\nare claimed for Direct Legislation. It is declared that the Initiative\r\nand Referendum keep lawmaking from being dominated by special\r\ninterests. Because it constitutes a check upon constitutional\r\nconventions and state legislatures, Direct Legislation is said to make\r\ngovernment more truly responsive to public opinion. It is claimed that\r\nDirect Legislation does not supplant, but rather supplements,\r\nimproves, and renders more democratic, the formal legislative\r\nmachinery. In several states, and especially in Oregon, it is claimed\r\nthat the device stimulates political interest on the part of the\r\nvoters. In Oregon the authorities print a pamphlet containing a\r\nstatement of proposed laws, and summarizing the arguments of both\r\nadvocates and opponents of each measure. Some weeks before the measure\r\nis to be decided at the polls this pamphlet is sent at public expense\r\nto every registered voter in the state.\r\n\r\n472. OBJECTIVES URGED AGAINST DIRECT LEGISLATION.--Critics of the\r\nInitiative and the Referendum maintain that Direct Legislation has\r\nmany serious defects. It is declared that by breaking down and\r\nweakening the state legislature, this type of legislation threatens\r\nthe integrity of the framework of government established by the state\r\nconstitution. It is pointed out that Direct Legislation shifts\r\nlawmaking from a definite group (the state legislature), to a large\r\nand indefinite group of persons (the voters as a class), upon whom\r\nresponsibility cannot be fixed. By robbing the legislature of power\r\nand responsibility, the Initiative and Referendum are said to degrade\r\nrather than to improve that body: the best class of men is not\r\nattracted to a legislature which has been shorn of dignity and\r\ninfluence, and if the people rely upon the Initiative and Referendum,\r\nthe voters deem it less necessary to choose honest, capable\r\nlegislators.\r\n\r\nIt is also maintained that the Initiative and Referendum do not\r\npromote independence of political thought, since only a mechanical\r\n\"Yes\" or \"No\" is demanded of the voters. In all states where Direct\r\nLegislation is applied, it is said, so few persons actually vote that\r\nlegislation is really determined by a small minority of the voters.\r\nAgain, the ease with which the Initiative and Referendum may be set in\r\nmotion allows so many measures to be brought before the people that\r\nthey cannot vote upon them intelligently. It is also said that Direct\r\nLegislation is primarily the instrument of the propagandist, because\r\nin many cases cranks and professional agitators monopolize the\r\nprivilege of circulating petitions.\r\n\r\nA serious defect of Direct Legislation is that the drafting of many\r\nlaws requires detailed and technical information which the average\r\nvoter is in no position to secure. In several states, notably in\r\nMaine, the recognition of this difficulty has led to the adoption of a\r\nmodified Initiative. According to this plan, the state legislature may\r\nexamine any measure proposed by the voters, enact an alternative\r\nmeasure of its own, and submit both to popular approval. The voters\r\ndecide between the two. The difficulty with this plan is that it is\r\nnot only expensive, but that by doubling the number of measures to be\r\nweighed and studied it imposes an added burden upon the voter at the\r\npolls.\r\n\r\n473. THE RECALL.--The Recall is a device whereby certain elective\r\nofficials who have not given satisfaction in office may be required to\r\nstand for reŰelection before the end of their terms. The Recall is set\r\nin motion when a petition has been duly signed by a specified\r\npercentage of the voters, usually at least twenty-five per cent. The\r\nRecall cannot be employed until the official in question has been in\r\noffice a specified period, so that he shall have had an opportunity to\r\ngive satisfaction before being subject to recall. Accused officials\r\nmay forestall the Recall by resigning when a petition is launched\r\nagainst them, otherwise they must stand for reŰlection. The ballot\r\nwhich goes to the people contains, in brief, the objections to the\r\nofficial, and, in some states, also the reply of the accused\r\nofficeholder. If defeated at the polls the accused official must\r\nretire from office; if vindicated, he continues in office during the\r\nremainder of his term.\r\n\r\nThe principle of the Recall was recognized in American state\r\ngovernment before the end of the eighteenth century, but in its\r\npresent application it is much younger. In its modern form the Recall\r\nwas first used in 1903, when the city of Los Angeles applied it to\r\nelective municipal officials. Five years later Oregon adopted it for\r\nall state officers, and since 1908 it has spread to a number of other\r\nstates, most of them in the western part of the country. The Recall\r\nhas been used chiefly against city officials, though in several states\r\nit may be applied to a majority of both local and state officials. In\r\nOregon, California, Arizona, Colorado, and Nevada, the Recall may also\r\nbe used against judges.\r\n\r\n474. ARGUMENTS FOR THE RECALL.--Those favoring the Recall maintain\r\nthat it is the natural and legitimate expression of the right to\r\nremove unsatisfactory officials. It is pointed out that the Recall\r\npermits longer terms for elective officials, for if the voters know\r\nthat they can use the Recall to remove officials who prove\r\nunsatisfactory, they will feel safe in electing those officials for\r\nrelatively long terms. By reducing the number of elections, the device\r\nlightens the burdens of the voter. The Recall is said to be a\r\nwholesome reminder of preŰlection promises. It is also maintained that\r\nsince the Recall is a threat, it encourages officeholders to be honest\r\nand efficient.\r\n\r\n475. OBJECTIONS URGED AGAINST THE RECALL.--In answer to the above\r\narguments, the opponents of the Recall claim that the device\r\nencourages officials to curry popular favor, regardless of public\r\nduty. It may also place officials at the mercy of popular passion and\r\ncaprice. When it is applied to judges, the Recall threatens the\r\nintegrity and independence of a branch of government which ought to be\r\nremoved from popular clamor and prejudice. This last is a serious\r\nobjection, for it may happen that judges subject to the Recall will\r\nhesitate to hand down decisions that may prove unpopular, however just\r\nthose decisions may be. For this reason the extension of the Recall to\r\njudges is being strongly resisted. Even the most ardent advocates of\r\nthe device are beginning to admit that the Recall is more applicable\r\nto administrative officials than to judges.\r\n\r\n476. STATUS OF THE RECALL.--A satisfactory decision upon the merits of\r\nthe Recall is difficult because it is so recent a development and\r\nstill so little used that few data are available. The state-wide\r\nRecall has been in existence for a number of years, yet few state\r\nofficials have been removed by it. Los Angeles used the Recall to\r\nunseat the mayor in 1904 and in 1909, and in 1911 the device was used\r\nagainst the mayor of Seattle. But the Recall is primarily a threat,\r\nand is rarely used. In view of this fact, the arguments for and\r\nagainst the device rest upon theory rather than upon actual\r\nexperience. The Recall has great possibilities for good if wisely\r\nadministered, but it may become an evil influence if carelessly or\r\nrevengefully used.\r\n\r\n477. SIGNIFICANCE OF POPULAR CONTROL.--The development of the\r\nInitiative, the Referendum, and the Recall indicates a growing\r\nimpatience with the abuses of party power, the evils of the long\r\nballot, and the corruption and inefficiency of many legislative\r\nbodies. It is significant that direct popular control has accompanied\r\nthe widespread movement to reform municipal government, and that it is\r\nplaying an increasingly important part in the movement to reform state\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\nUp to the present time, the Initiative, the Referendum, and the Recall\r\nhave been confined chiefly to the West, where political problems are\r\nless acute than in the East, and where, too, the tendency toward\r\ndirect participation in government has always been marked.\r\nNevertheless, there is some indication that the future will see an\r\nextension of direct popular control, not only in the West, but also in\r\nother parts of the country. Whether or not this extension is desirable\r\nwe cannot now say. But certainly it is an interesting and important\r\ndevelopment, and one demanding careful study and mature deliberation\r\non the part of those who seek to make American government highly\r\neffective.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS ON THE TEXT\r\n\r\n1.

THE NATURE OF PUBLIC OPINION.--One of the most powerful\r\ninfluences in any community is that intangible something which we call\r\nPublic Opinion. Though everyone is familiar with it, the term Public\r\nOpinion is difficult to define. Public Opinion is intimately connected\r\nwith the opinion of the individual, and yet is something more than a\r\nmere total of individual opinions.\r\n\r\nEvery man has a set of opinions or beliefs which are characteristic of\r\nhis native instincts, his home training, and other influences which\r\nhave helped mould his personality. Wherever individuals associate, the\r\nopinions of each person affect and are affected by the opinions of his\r\nfellows. As the result of this interaction we think of public opinion\r\nas being made up of a number of different currents, each embodying a\r\nview, a belief, or a doctrine. Where many individuals support a given\r\nview with moderate intensity, or where a small group feels very\r\nintensely upon a given topic, we say that Public Opinion has formed.\r\n\r\nPublic Opinion may be defined as a definite focus of individual\r\nopinions which are either numerous or intense enough to constitute a\r\nrecognizable force, and to exert a noticeable influence upon the life\r\nof the community.\r\n\r\n479. PUBLIC OPINION AND LAW.--It is characteristic of the human mind\r\nthat we perceive concrete and tangible things more easily than we\r\nunderstand abstract and intangible forces. Law is a definite,\r\nconcrete, almost tangible thing; we perceive its outlines, recognize\r\nits various forms, and understand its nature and significance. But it\r\nis less easy to understand that law may be only a symptom of Public\r\nOpinion, only the concrete expression of intangible community\r\nsentiment. There is an interaction between law and Public Opinion, but\r\nthe latter is the more fundamental and the more powerful. Public\r\nOpinion which is vigorous and well-organized may force the enactment\r\nof law; on the other hand, a law which runs counter to the prevailing\r\nstate of Public Opinion may cease to be effective, because individuals\r\nwill not co÷perate in enforcing it. Law half leads, half follows\r\nPublic Opinion, and when legislators are skilled in discerning and\r\ninfluencing the mental attitudes of the people, law and Public Opinion\r\npretty well keep pace with one another.\r\n\r\n480. PUBLIC OPINION IN A DEMOCRACY.--The beliefs and opinions of the\r\nmasses have been an important force even in the most absolute of\r\nmonarchies; in representative democracies Public Opinion is even more\r\nimportant. Under a democratic form of government the attitude of the\r\nmasses tends to be one of inquiry, self-confidence, and self-\r\nexpression upon public questions. Lord Bryce has pointed out that\r\nbecause democracy permits and encourages freedom of discussion, Public\r\nOpinion in a country like the United States becomes much more powerful\r\nthan in less democratic countries.\r\n\r\nAnd not only is Public Opinion more powerful in a democracy, but\r\ndemocracy is impossible without the regular exercise of a well-\r\ninformed and sensible opinion by the majority of its citizens.\r\nDemocracy emphasizes government _by_ the people rather than government\r\n_of_ the people. Thus if genuine democracy is to be developed and\r\nsustained, the people must cultivate an attitude of constant vigilance\r\nagainst civic indifference. Nominations and elections are focal\r\nperiods in government, but government is a continuous obligation which\r\nrequires constant rather than intermittent attention. Where civic\r\ninterest is neither strong nor consistent, the virtues of democracy\r\nmay be diffused in blind and leaderless wanderings.\r\n\r\n481. DEVELOPMENT OF PUBLIC OPINION.--Even though never definitely\r\nfocused or expressed, the vague beliefs, fancies, and prejudices of\r\nindividuals may influence public affairs by causing community leaders\r\nto feel that \"the people\" will or will not tolerate a contemplated\r\nline of action.\r\n\r\nBut the influence exerted will be much greater if the opinions of the\r\nindividual are definite, and if there is some method of clarifying,\r\nco÷rdinating and expressing the opinions of groups of individuals upon\r\na given subject. If the opinions of the individual are to be definite\r\nand concrete, he must habitually come in contact with forceful persons\r\nand institutions; if the opinions of various individuals are to be\r\nco÷rdinated and expressed there must be either physical contiguity\r\namong people, or else adequate means of transportation and\r\ncommunication.\r\n\r\nWe may now consider a few of the forces which serve to make definite\r\nand to organize the opinions of individuals.\r\n\r\n482. THE HOME.--Certainly no institution exerts a more powerful\r\ninfluence upon the beliefs and opinions of the individual than the\r\nhome. Our basic ideals and traditions pass from generation to\r\ngeneration through the continuity of the family life. During the\r\nplastic and impressionable period of infancy the child is constantly\r\nunder the influence of the parents. At first fashioned largely by the\r\nparents, the beliefs and sentiments of the growing child are later\r\nmodified by contact with other family members. When children go out to\r\nthe school, the church or the workshop, beliefs and attitudes\r\nencountered outside the home are weighed in the light of family\r\nteachings. When young men and young women make homes of their own,\r\nthey in turn imprint upon their children a complex of tradition and\r\nopinion which is the compromise result of their own family training,\r\nmodified by influences later encountered outside the family circle.\r\n\r\n483. THE SCHOOL.--Supplementing, and in some respects supplanting, the\r\ninfluence of the home is the influence of the school. While still in\r\nthe plastic stage the child is given over to the moulding influences\r\nof teacher and fellow-students. New contacts are made, new opinions\r\nare encountered, new avenues of thought and action are opened to the\r\nyoung and growing mind. Of recent years the tendency of the school to\r\nidentify itself more closely with the practical life of the community\r\nis increasing the power and influence of that institution. The school\r\nis proving a genuine means of transition between the relatively\r\nlocalized influence of the home and the more widely diffused\r\ninfluences of the community.\r\n\r\n484. THE CHURCH.--Closely related to the school as a determinant of\r\nopinion is the church. In the early stages of social development the\r\nhome was equally the center of intellectual and religious life, but in\r\nrecent times the church and the school have become separate, though\r\nrelated, institutions. The child spends more time in school than in\r\nthe company of religious instructors other than his parents, but\r\naffiliation with the church often continues throughout the life of the\r\nindividual, while the average child leaves school at a relatively\r\nearly age. From the standpoint of Public Opinion, the primary\r\nimportance of the church is that it exerts a powerful influence upon\r\nthe ideals and conduct of both young and old. And as in the case of\r\nthe school, this influence is being deepened by the increasingly close\r\nconnection between the church and the practical life of the community.\r\n\r\n485. THE THEATER.--The theatre has always been a vital influence in\r\nman's aesthetic and emotional life. Drama, opera, comedy, and\r\nburlesque are variant forms, but they are alike in that they influence\r\nthe audience. In the last decade the moving picture has greatly\r\nincreased the power and influence of the theatre. The low price of the\r\nmoving picture brings the theatre to millions who formerly were\r\nexcluded from any appreciable degree of theatrical entertainment. The\r\ndaily moving picture attendance of ten million people, the stimulating\r\neffect of music, the strong emotional appeal, the tender age of many\r\nof the audience, and the growing use of the moving picture as\r\npropaganda, all combine to make the film a powerful factor in the\r\nformation of Public Opinion.\r\n\r\n486. THE PRESS.--The press is the nervous system of the nation.\r\nSupplemented by other means of communication, and aided by agencies of\r\ntransportation, the press co÷rdinates individuals not physically\r\ncontiguous, and thus enables them to act in concert. It lets everybody\r\nknow what everybody else is thinking, or at least what they are\r\nsupposed to be thinking. The forms of the printed page are infinitely\r\nvarious: daily papers, weeklies, monthlies, pamphlets, and books,--all\r\nof these are increasingly numerous. Statesmen, teachers, reformers,\r\npropagandists, and professional writers combine to turn out tons of\r\nprinted matter a day. Pictures, jokes, contests, and stories are\r\nresorted to for the purpose of attracting attention. Editorials,\r\nadvertisements, and news articles are among the vehicles of expression\r\nused. Printed matter does not wait for the individual to seek it out,\r\nbut instead it goes to him. In various forms it encounters him in the\r\nstreet, stares at him from shop windows and billboards, forces itself\r\nupon his attention in the street cars, and knocks at the door of his\r\nprivate dwelling. In all its forms, it should be remembered, the\r\ndominant aim of the printed page is to influence the individual, to\r\ncause him to do something or to refrain from doing something.\r\n\r\n487. GROWING IMPORTANCE OF PUBLIC OPINION.--Despite the volume of\r\nEuropean immigration to this country, American ideals and institutions\r\nare rendering our population more and more homogeneous, and thus more\r\nopen to unifying influences. The increasing ease of transportation and\r\ncommunication is everywhere making isolation more difficult. Not only\r\nare the school, the church, the press, and the theatre widening in\r\nscope and increasing in influence, but new forms of expression are\r\ndeveloping. There is a growing number of private organizations\r\nadvocating social, economic, or political reforms. The popularization\r\nof psychology has encouraged the rise of innumerable forms of\r\npropaganda designed to influence the opinions of the community and\r\nnation. Occupational and social groups are everywhere organizing,\r\nclarifying their opinions, and expressing common principles in the\r\neffort to influence the public mind. All of these factors combine to\r\nincrease the importance of Public Opinion in present-day American\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n488. DANGERS OF UNREGULATED PUBLIC OPINION.--The growing power of\r\nPublic Opinion brings with it increased possibilities for good, but\r\nalso increased possibilities for evil. In an important sense, this is\r\nthe age of the propagandist, the crank reformer, and the subsidized\r\nnewspaper, the age of the agitator who spreads lies through anonymous\r\nletters, unsigned posters, and irresponsible whisperings. The\r\nindividual must be constantly on his guard against this flood; he must\r\nrecognize that Public Opinion is often capricious, and that a sudden\r\nhysteria may inflict untold injury. The morality of a mob is inferior\r\nto the morality of the individuals composing the mob, because in a mob\r\nthe sense of power is dominant and the sense of responsibility is\r\nsuppressed. Properly speaking a mob depends upon physical contiguity,\r\nbut the co÷rdinating influence of rapid transportation and\r\ncommunication may create a mob spirit between individuals not\r\nphysically in contact. When propaganda lashes into a passion groups of\r\npeople in widely separated areas, democracy becomes the most dangerous\r\nof all forms of government: there is no sure hand upon the helm, the\r\npeople control _en masse_, in a burst of passion they may lay waste\r\nthe social heritage of centuries.\r\n\r\n489. FREEDOM A PARTIAL SAFEGUARD AGAINST UNSOUND PUBLIC OPINION.--\r\nWhile democracy facilitates the creation of the mob spirit, it\r\nlikewise carries within itself at least a partial remedy for unsound\r\nPublic Opinion. Men's opinions are infinitely various: the same\r\ncommunity that produces the fanatic or the impractical idealist\r\ngenerally produces sensible and practical men as well. In politics men\r\neverywhere tend to divide into a radical group and a conservative\r\ngroup, between which control of the government oscillates.\r\n\r\nWhere freedom of expression is permitted, the existence of these two\r\nantagonistic camps is automatically a safeguard of the public welfare.\r\nAny one of a number of groups of people might ruin the country if left\r\nto themselves. But they are _not_ left to themselves. Their opponents\r\nare constantly criticizing and checking them. When cranks launch\r\npropaganda, conservative critics launch counter-propaganda; when\r\nspecial interests attempt to influence the public mind, public-\r\nspirited individuals or organizations force both sides of the question\r\nbefore the public. When public officials neglect their duties, a\r\nthousand discerning men are ready to shout the fact from the\r\nhousetops. Though the majority party secures control of government,\r\nthe minority is never idle. Rather, it is constantly watching,\r\nwaiting, marshaling opinion against the majority, calling public\r\nattention to the mistakes of their opponents, and agitating for a\r\nchange of administration.\r\n\r\n490. THE GUIDANCE OF PUBLIC OPINION.--Let us briefly consider the\r\nquestion of guiding or directing the formulation of sound Public\r\nOpinion. In a free country, such guidance may sometimes prove\r\ndangerous, and yet careful direction of the formulation of Public\r\nOpinion is justified by two facts: First, the formulation of sound\r\nopinion is retarded by the great difficulty of securing adequate\r\ninformation on the great problems of modern civilization. Here the\r\nindividual needs some help. Second, everyone who can distinguish\r\nbetween license and liberty must agree that we should limit the\r\ninfluence of individuals and institutions which suppress minority\r\nopinion, and distort facts in the effort to pervert Public Opinion.\r\n\r\nThese considerations suggest two distinct lines of action.\r\n\r\nFirst, we can aid in the formulation of sound opinion by making it\r\neasier for the individual to secure data and information on current\r\ntopics. The extension and perfection of the postal service, the\r\nimprovement of our system of transportation, the spread of the school\r\nand library, and possibly the free distribution of literature dealing\r\nwith the nature and functions of government, these and similar\r\nmeasures would prove helpful.\r\n\r\nSecond, law and moral education ought to co÷perate in suppressing\r\ninfluences which seek deliberately to poison or pervert the public\r\nmind. Free speech is a priceless element in democracy, but just as we\r\nmust harmonize individual liberty with the interests of the group, so\r\nwe must prevent the use of free speech for criminal purposes.\r\nEspecially ought the press and the school to be encouraged to give\r\nboth sides of debatable questions. Every agency dealing with the\r\nissues of American life, indeed, ought to be careful not to distort\r\nthose issues by suppressing or misusing facts. Above all, we must be\r\ncareful not to pander to low ideals by emphasizing the negative and\r\ndestructive side of our problems.\r\n\r\n491. RESPONSIBILITY OF THE INDIVIDUAL.--A progressive civilization\r\nconfers more and more benefits upon the individual, but his duties and\r\nresponsibilities increase with equal speed. As Theodore Roosevelt once\r\nsaid, \"It is not difficult to be virtuous in a cloistered and negative\r\nway,\" but honestly and effectively to fulfill the obligations of\r\ncitizenship in a complex society is less easy. And yet the need of\r\nindividual responsibility is infinitely greater in a modern community\r\nthan among the members of an isolated and self-sufficient group. When\r\nsmall isolated villages were the dominant form of American settlement,\r\nthe laxness of one group did not vitally affect the welfare of other\r\ngroups. But so entwined are the present-day citizens of the United\r\nStates that the acts of one individual may vitally affect the national\r\nwell-being. The carelessness of a food canner on the Pacific coast may\r\ncost the life of a family on the Atlantic seaboard; a swindle\r\noriginating in the East may demoralize individuals throughout the\r\ncountry. The obligations of citizenship have become national as well\r\nas local; in thought and in action the individual must function, not\r\nonly in terms of his locality, but in terms of the nation as well.\r\n\r\n492. THE POWER OF THE INDIVIDUAL.--Measuring himself against more than\r\na hundred million of his fellows, the average American citizen is\r\nlikely to be overpowered by the apparent futility and powerlessness of\r\nhis personal opinions. And yet the power of the nation is only the\r\nresult of the combined influences of its individual citizens. All\r\npower is with the individual. However much the absolute monarchy may\r\nhave suppressed the individual, in a democracy he can become a vital\r\nforce in government. We are too fond of taking censuses on the one\r\nhand, and of deferring to governmental mechanisms on the other. The\r\nindividual _is_ master of his fate, and he _is_ the ultimate\r\ndeterminant of government. If government is sound, the misbehavior of\r\nthe individual can ruin it; if government is defective, the assumption\r\nof responsibility by the individual must ultimately reform it. We do\r\nnot need a fool-proof government half as much as we need active,\r\nresponsible individuals to run the government we already have. \"How\r\nlong will American democracy last?\" a European statesman once asked.\r\n\"Just so long,\" the answer might have been, \"as Americans honestly and\r\nintelligently grapple with the problems confronting them, holding\r\nthemselves individually responsible for the conduct of government, and\r\nseeking consistently to exert an influence upon their community life\r\nwhich shall be constructive and inspirational.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS ON THE TEXT\r\n\r\n1.

THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERAL SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nA. BACKGROUND OF THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION [Footnote: For a fuller\r\ndiscussion of the background of the Federal Constitution, see Chapters\r\nII and III.]\r\n\r\n493. COLONIAL GOVERNMENTS.--It is possible to classify the American\r\ncolonies as charter, royal, and proprietary, and to point out\r\nimportant differences between these three types.\r\n\r\nBut these differences fade in importance before the broad and\r\nfundamental similarities existing among the colonies. Just as there\r\nwas among the colonies a substantial unity of race, language, and\r\nreligion, so there was a basic similarity in political institutions.\r\nAll of the colonies were under relatively the same degree of control\r\nby England, and consequently all of them had much the same degree of\r\nfreedom in managing their own affairs. In each colony a governor acted\r\nas chief executive. In each colony, likewise, there was a legislature.\r\nIn most of the colonies this legislature consisted of two houses, the\r\nlower of which was elected by the people. Colonial jurisprudence\r\neverywhere grounded upon the common law of England. In each colony\r\nthere was a system of courts, largely following English judicial\r\nprocedure. In local government there was a good deal of variation\r\namong the colonies, but everywhere the English model was followed, and\r\neverywhere the principle of local autonomy was asserted and\r\nchampioned.\r\n\r\n494. EARLY ATTEMPTS AT UNION.--These fundamental similarities,\r\ntogether with the rise of common problems and the pressure of outside\r\nenemies, encouraged federation among the colonies. A notable attempt\r\nat union was made in 1643, when Massachusetts Bay, Plymouth,\r\nConnecticut, and New Haven united in a league of friendship, primarily\r\nfor mutual defense against the Indians. This league rendered effective\r\nservice during the forty years of its life. In 1754 delegates from\r\nseven colonies met at Albany and adopted a plan of union proposed by\r\nBenjamin Franklin. The project was never carried through, but it is\r\nsignificant as indicating the trend toward union. Still later (1765)\r\nthe Stamp Act Congress showed that the delegates of at least nine\r\ncolonies could join in a protest against England's taxation policy.\r\nThe two Continental Congresses may also be considered as steps toward\r\nunion. The first of these (1774) concerned itself chiefly with a\r\ndeclaration of rights and grievances, but the second (1775-1781) went\r\nso far as to assume and exercise revolutionary powers.\r\n\r\n495. THE ARTICLES OF CONFEDERATION.--Impelled by the necessity of a\r\nunited front against England, the Second Continental Congress sought\r\nto give force to the Declaration of Independence by drawing up a\r\ncomprehensive plan of union. This plan, embodied in the Articles of\r\nConfederation, was put into operation on March 1, 1781. The new\r\ngovernment was a confederation or league of states, rather than a\r\nfederal government such as we have to-day. The states gave up such\r\nimportant powers as the right to declare war, and the right to borrow\r\nand coin money, but the Articles specifically declared that \"each\r\nstate retains its sovereignty, freedom, and independence, and every\r\npower, jurisdiction, and right which is not by this federation\r\ndelegated to the United States in Congress assembled.\"\r\n\r\nThe Confederation government was seriously defective. There was no\r\nnational executive and no judiciary. All authority was concentrated in\r\na one-chambered congress, the delegates to which were entirely under\r\nthe control of the state legislatures which chose them. The central\r\ngovernment had no real authority or power. Its congress could reach\r\nthe individual only through the action of the state governments, and\r\nthese it could not coerce. The Confederation government managed to\r\ncarry the states through the last two years of the war, and then\r\ndeclined rapidly in power and influence. The Congress could not force\r\nthe states to co÷perate with one another in matters of national\r\ninterest. The inability of the central government, either to pay the\r\ninterest on the national debt or to force the states to observe\r\ntreaties which we made with foreign powers, cost us the respect of\r\nEurope. \"We were bullied by England,\" writes John Fiske of this\r\nperiod, \"insulted by France, and looked askance at in Holland.\"\r\n\r\nThe defects of the Articles could not be remedied, for amendment was\r\nby unanimous consent only, and on every occasion that an amendment was\r\nproposed, one or more states refused their assent. By 1786 it was the\r\nconviction of most American statesmen that if the country were to be\r\nsaved from anarchy and ruin the central government would have to be\r\nreorganized.\r\n\r\n496. THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION OF 1787.--In May, 1787, delegates\r\nfrom every state except Rhode Island came together in Philadelphia to\r\nconsider \"means necessary to render the Constitution of the Federal\r\ngovernment adequate to the exigencies of the Union.\"\r\n\r\nEarly in the session Edmund Randolph introduced what has been called\r\nthe Virginia plan. This called for an abandonment of the Articles of\r\nConfederation and demanded the establishment of a strong national\r\ngovernment. The Virginia plan favored the larger and more populous\r\nstates by providing a national Congress of two houses, in both of\r\nwhich representation was to be on the basis of population.\r\n\r\nOf the several other plans put before the Convention the most notable\r\nwas that proposed by William Paterson of New Jersey. The adherents of\r\nthis plan wished to retain the Articles of Confederation. The Articles\r\nwere to be revised so as to give greater powers to the central\r\ngovernment, but in most practical concerns the states were to continue\r\nsovereign. The New Jersey plan opposed the idea of a two-chambered\r\nlegislature in which the states were to be represented on the basis of\r\npopulation. If representation in both houses of Congress were on the\r\nbasis of population, it was declared, the larger and more populous\r\nstates would be able to dominate the National government and the\r\nrights of the smaller states would be inadequately safeguarded.\r\n\r\nAfter a long debate a compromise plan was adopted. It was agreed that\r\nthere should be established a strong national government, but one\r\nsufficiently checked by constitutional provisions to safeguard the\r\nrights of the states. The national legislature was to consist of two\r\nhouses. In the upper house the states were to be represented equally,\r\nwhile in the lower chamber representation was to be on the basis of\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\n497. THE NEW GOVERNMENT.--The Convention completed the Constitution on\r\nSeptember 17, 1787, and the document was immediately placed before the\r\nstates. By the summer of 1788 the necessary number of states had\r\nratified the Constitution, and on April 30, 1789, the new government\r\nwas put to work under George Washington as first President.\r\n\r\nThe English statesman Gladstone has implied that our Constitution was\r\nan original creation, \"struck off at a given time by the brain and\r\npurpose of man.\" But as a matter of fact the Constitution was not so\r\nmuch the result of political originality as it was a careful selection\r\nfrom British and colonial experience. The trial of the Confederation\r\ngovernment had proved especially valuable, and in drawing up the\r\nFederal Constitution, the members of the Constitutional Convention\r\nwere careful to avoid the defects of the Articles of Confederation.\r\nThe most fundamental difference between the Confederation government\r\nand the new Federal government was that the Federal Constitution\r\nprovided for an adequate executive and judiciary to enforce the\r\nFederal laws directly upon the individual. The Confederation\r\ngovernment, it will be remembered, had been obliged to rely upon the\r\nstates for the enforcement of all laws.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. FRAMEWORK OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\n498. THE THEORY OF LIMITED GOVERNMENT.--The new Constitution created a\r\nsystem of Federal government which retains the advantages of local\r\nself-government for the states, but at the same time secures the\r\nstrength which results from union. The government of the United States\r\nis a compromise between centralization and decentralization, the\r\nbalance between these two extremes being maintained by a rather\r\nelaborate system of checks, balances, and limitations.\r\n\r\nThese checks, balances, and limitations we may consider under five\r\nheads: first, private rights under the Federal Constitution; second,\r\nthe threefold division of powers in the Federal government; third, the\r\ndivision of powers between Federal and state governments; fourth,\r\ninterstate relations; and fifth, the supremacy of Federal law.\r\n\r\n499. PRIVATE RIGHTS UNDER THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION. [Footnote: For the\r\nprohibitions upon the states in favor of private rights, see Chapter\r\nXLV.]--The constitutional limitations upon the Federal government in\r\nbehalf of private rights fall into two groups: those designed to\r\nprotect personal liberty, [Footnote: Some of the limitations in favor\r\nof personal liberty enumerated in this section are contained in the\r\nfirst ten amendments to the Constitution, adopted in a body in 1791.]\r\nand those designed to protect property rights.\r\n\r\nIn many important particulars the Federal Constitution protects\r\npersonal liberty against arbitrary interference on the part of the\r\nNational government. Congress may pass no law establishing or\r\nprohibiting any religion, or abridging either freedom of speech or\r\nfreedom of the press. The right of the people peaceably to assemble\r\nand petition the government for a redress of grievances shall not be\r\ndenied. The privilege of the writ of _habeas corpus_ shall not be\r\nsuspended. Congress may not define treason. Neither bills of\r\nattainder, nor _ex-post facto_ legislation may be passed by Congress.\r\nJury trial, fair bail, and freedom from both excessive fines and cruel\r\nand unusual punishments are guaranteed by the Constitution. Neither\r\nlife, liberty nor property may be taken without due process of law.\r\n\r\nThe Federal Constitution likewise protects the property rights of the\r\nindividual against Federal aggression. The state governments alone may\r\ndefine property. Congress may not tax articles which are exported from\r\nany state. All direct taxes must be apportioned according to\r\npopulation. [Footnote: The Sixteenth Amendment exempts the income tax\r\nfrom this rule.] All duties, imposts, and excises must be uniform,\r\nthat is, they must fall upon the same article with the same weight\r\nwherever found. Under the right of eminent domain, the Federal\r\ngovernment may take private property for public use, but in such a\r\ncase the owner must be fairly compensated.\r\n\r\n500. THREEFOLD DIVISION OF POWERS IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.--A\r\nsecond distinctive feature of our system of government is that Federal\r\nauthority is distributed among three distinct branches: the executive,\r\nthe legislative, and the judicial. This is part of the general system\r\nof \"checks and balances\" by means of which the framers of the\r\nConstitution sought to prevent any branch or division of government\r\nfrom securing undue control of the governmental machinery.\r\n\r\nThe basic merit of this threefold division of powers is that it\r\nsafeguards each branch of government against aggression from the other\r\ntwo branches. And yet this division of powers is by no means so\r\ncomplete that the three branches do not work together. For example,\r\nboth the appointive and the treaty-making powers of the President are\r\nshared by the Senate. The President shares in legislation through his\r\nveto power, as well as through his right to send messages to Congress.\r\nThe Senate has the right to impeach all civil officers of the United\r\nStates, and may even exert some control over the Supreme Court through\r\nits right to prescribe the number of its judges and the amount of\r\ntheir salaries. The judiciary, on the other hand, enjoys the unique\r\npower of passing upon the constitutionality of the acts of the other\r\ntwo branches of government.\r\n\r\n501. DIVISION OF POWERS BETWEEN FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS.--\r\nAnother feature of the check and balance system is that authority is\r\ndivided between Federal and state governments. The Tenth Amendment\r\ndeclares that \"the powers not delegated to the United States by the\r\nConstitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the\r\nstates.\" Thus we speak of the National government as enjoying\r\ndelegated or enumerated powers, while the state governments have\r\nresidual or unenumerated powers. The Federal government must show some\r\nspecific or implied grant of power for everything that it does, but\r\nstate governments need only show that the Federal Constitution does\r\nnot prohibit them from doing whatever they see fit.\r\n\r\nThis division of powers between Federal and state governments has\r\nseveral distinct advantages. For example, it allows Federal and state\r\ngovernments to act as a check upon one another. Furthermore, the\r\ndevice admirably divides governmental labor: the Federal government is\r\ngiven control of matters essentially national, while the states are\r\nleft in charge of affairs distinctly state or local in character.\r\n\r\n502. INTERSTATE RELATIONS.--Further to guarantee the integrity of the\r\nFederal system, the Constitution specifies the fundamental nature of\r\ninterstate relations. The states are independent of one another, and\r\nare equal in Federal law. The laws of a state have no force, and their\r\npublic officials have no authority, beyond the state limits.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution specifically provides that \"full faith and credit\r\nshall be given in each state to the public acts, records, and judicial\r\nproceedings of every other state.\" This does not mean that the laws of\r\na particular state are binding upon persons in other states. It does\r\nmean, however, that the courts of each state shall endeavor to give\r\nthe same force to the laws of a neighboring state as those laws would\r\nhave in the courts of the legislating state.\r\n\r\nTo prevent discriminations against citizens of other states, the\r\nFederal Constitution provides that the citizens of each state are\r\n\"entitled to all the privileges and immunities of citizens in the\r\nseveral states.\" This means that a citizen of one state may remove to\r\na neighboring state, and there enjoy the same civil rights that the\r\ncitizens of the latter state enjoy.\r\n\r\nIn order that fugitive criminals may be tried and punished, the\r\nConstitution further provides that \"a person charged in any state with\r\ntreason, felony, or other crime, who shall flee from justice, and be\r\nfound in another state, shall, on the demand of the executive\r\nauthority of the state from which he fled, be delivered up to be\r\nremoved to the state having jurisdiction of the crime.\"\r\n\r\n503. SUPREMACY OF FEDERAL LAW.--A last distinctive feature of our\r\nsystem of government is that Federal law is supreme. The Constitution\r\nstates: \"This Constitution and the laws of the United States which\r\nshall be made in pursuance thereof, and all treaties made or which\r\nshall be made under the authority of the United States shall be the\r\nsupreme law of the land.\" The states are supreme in their sphere of\r\naction; nevertheless, when it is claimed that there is a conflict\r\nbetween state and Federal law, the latter prevails. Federal law is the\r\nsupreme law of the land, and, in the last instance, it is the Supreme\r\nCourt of the United States which is the interpreter of that law. The\r\ndecisions of the Supreme Court are binding upon the Federal\r\ngovernment, upon the several states, and upon private individuals.\r\n\r\n\r\nC. DEVELOPMENT OF THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION\r\n\r\n504. THE FORMAL AMENDING PROCESS.--The Constitution of the United\r\nStates may be formally amended in any one of four ways. First, an\r\namendment may be proposed by a two-thirds vote of each House of\r\nCongress, and ratified by the legislatures of three fourths of the\r\nstates. Second, an amendment may be proposed by a two-thirds vote of\r\neach House of Congress and ratified by conventions in three fourths of\r\nthe States. Third, an amendment may be proposed by a national\r\nconvention, called by Congress upon the request of the legislatures of\r\ntwo thirds of the states, and ratified by the legislatures of three\r\nfourths of the states. The fourth method resembles the third, except\r\nthat ratification is by conventions in three fourths of the states.\r\n\r\n505. AMENDMENTS I-XIX.--There have been nineteen Amendments to the\r\nFederal Constitution. [Footnote: For the full text of these Amendments\r\nsee the Appendix.]\r\n\r\nOf these the first ten were adopted as a body in 1791, to satisfy\r\nthose who feared that the new Constitution did not adequately protect\r\nindividual or states' rights against Federal aggression. Amendments I-\r\nVIII are designed to protect the fundamental rights of the individual.\r\nThe Ninth and Tenth express the principle that the Federal government\r\nis one of enumerated powers, while those powers not specifically\r\nconferred upon the Federal government by the Constitution are reserved\r\nto the states or to the people.\r\n\r\nThe Eleventh Amendment, adopted in 1798, provided that the Federal\r\njudicial power should not be construed to extend to any suit against a\r\nstate by citizens of another state, or by citizens or subjects of any\r\nforeign state.\r\n\r\nThe Twelfth Amendment, adopted in 1804, provided that presidential\r\nelectors should cast separate ballots for President and Vice\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\nThe Thirteenth Amendment (1865) abolished slavery, the Fourteenth\r\n(1868) defined citizenship and sought to prevent the states from\r\ndiscriminating against certain classes of citizens, while the\r\nFifteenth Amendment (1870) declared that the right of citizens of the\r\nUnited States to vote shall not be denied or abridged on account of\r\nrace, color, or previous condition of servitude.\r\n\r\nIn 1913 the Sixteenth Amendment authorized Congress to tax incomes\r\nwithout apportionment among the several states, and without regard to\r\nany census or enumeration.\r\n\r\nIn the same year the Seventeenth Amendment provided for the direct\r\nelection of United States Senators.\r\n\r\nIn 1919 an Eighteenth Amendment prohibited the manufacture, sale, or\r\ntransportation of intoxicating liquors within, the importation thereof\r\ninto, or the exportation thereof from, the United States.\r\n\r\nA Nineteenth Amendment was adopted in 1920. This declared that the\r\nright to vote shall not be denied to any citizen of the United States\r\non account of sex.\r\n\r\n506. CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGES THROUGH JUDICIAL INTERPRETATION.--The\r\nFederal Constitution has also been modified and developed by judicial\r\ninterpretation. The United States Supreme Court has maintained that\r\nthe Federal government possesses not only those powers expressly\r\ngranted by the Constitution, but also those powers which are included\r\nwith, or implied from, powers expressly granted. This liberal\r\nconstruction is authorized by the Constitution itself, for the last\r\nclause in Section VIII of Article One of that document declares that\r\nCongress shall have power to \"make all laws which shall be necessary\r\nand proper for carrying into execution\" its enumerated powers. Under\r\nthis doctrine of implied powers, the influence of the National\r\ngovernment has been markedly extended, chiefly with regard to the war\r\npower, the power to regulate interstate commerce, and the power to\r\nlevy taxes and borrow money.\r\n\r\n507. CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGES THROUGH USAGE.--The Federal Constitution\r\nhas also been modified by the force of custom and political practices.\r\nExamples of the power of usage to modify the Constitution are\r\nnumerous, but a few will suffice to illustrate the principle. Custom\r\nhas limited the President of the United States to two terms. In\r\nconformity with a long-established custom, Presidential electors do\r\nnot exercise independent judgment, but merely register the vote of\r\ntheir respective constituents. Though the Constitution provides that\r\nthe appointive power of the President shall be exercised with the\r\nadvice and consent of the Senate, custom virtually prohibits the\r\nSenate from challenging the President's Cabinet appointments. On the\r\nother hand, many executive appointments of minor importance are\r\ndetermined solely by members of Congress. Usage decrees that the\r\nPresident alone may remove officers which he has appointed with the\r\nadvice and consent of the Senate. Lastly, the legislative committee\r\nsystem, as well as the entire machinery of the political party, is the\r\noutcome of custom. Concerning these important instruments of practical\r\npolitics, the Constitution is silent.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS ON THE TEXT\r\n\r\n1.

ORIGINAL METHOD OF CHOOSING THE PRESIDENT.--The Federal\r\nConstitution sought to protect the office of chief magistrate against\r\npopular passion by providing for the indirect election of the\r\nPresident. According to the Constitution, each state was to appoint,\r\n\"in such manner as the legislature thereof may direct,\" a number of\r\nelectors equal to the state's combined quota of senators and\r\nrepresentatives in Congress. These electors were to meet, each group\r\nin its own state, and were to vote by ballot for two persons. These\r\nballots were then to be transmitted sealed to Congress, where the\r\nPresident of the Senate was to open and count them in the presence of\r\nboth houses. The person receiving the highest number of votes was to\r\nbe declared President, while the individual obtaining the next highest\r\nnumber was to fill the office of Vice President.\r\n\r\n509. CHANGES IN THE ORIGINAL METHOD OF CHOOSING THE PRESIDENT.--Three\r\nimportant changes have been brought about in the original method of\r\nchoosing the President.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of our national history, the state legislatures\r\nthemselves chose the Presidential electors, but with the spread of\r\ndemocracy the legislatures gradually transferred the choice of these\r\nelectors to the people. To-day Presidential electors are in every\r\nstate chosen by popular vote, on a general state-wide ticket.\r\n\r\nAfter the election of 1800 it became apparent that in order to prevent\r\nthe candidate for Vice President from defeating the candidate for\r\nPresident, there would have to be a separate ballot for each of these\r\nofficers. In 1804 there was accordingly passed the Twelfth Amendment\r\nto the Constitution, providing that Presidential electors should\r\nthenceforth cast separate ballots for President and Vice President.\r\n\r\nParty politics have effected a third change in the original method of\r\nchoosing the President. The Constitution evidently intended that the\r\nPresidential electors should be men of high repute, and that they\r\nshould select the nation's chief executive as the result of mature\r\ndeliberation and independent judgment. But as early as the third\r\nPresidential election (1796) it became clearly understood that the\r\nelectors would merely register the opinions of their constituents.\r\nTechnically the electors still choose the President; as a matter of\r\nfact they exercise no discretion, but merely express decisions\r\npreviously reached by their respective constituents.\r\n\r\n510. PRESENT METHOD OF CHOOSING THE PRESIDENT.--To-day the President\r\nof the United States is elected as follows:\r\n\r\nEach political party nominates a candidate for the presidency at a\r\nnational convention held in June or July of the presidential year. At\r\nabout the same time the various parties in each state nominate the\r\nquota of presidential electors to which the state is entitled. The\r\npeople vote on these electors on the Tuesday following the first\r\nMonday in November of each leap year. In each state the electors\r\nreceiving a plurality assemble at the state capitol on the second\r\nMonday in January following their election, and vote directly for\r\nPresident and Vice President. These votes are then certified and sent\r\nto the President of the Senate. On the second Wednesday in February,\r\nthis officer opens them, and in the presence of the two houses of\r\nCongress, counts them, and declares elected the candidate who has\r\nreceived the majority of the electoral votes. If no candidate has a\r\nmajority, the House of Representatives elects one of the three leading\r\ncandidates, the Representatives from each state casting one vote. In\r\n1800 and again in 1824, the presidential election was thus decided by\r\nthe House.\r\n\r\n511. QUALIFICATIONS.--All persons who are entitled to vote for the\r\nmost numerous branch of the state legislature are entitled, likewise,\r\nto vote in presidential elections. [Footnote: For limitations upon the\r\nsuffrage in the various states, see Chapter XXXIII, Section 415.]\r\n\r\nNo presidential elector may hold any office of trust or profit under\r\nthe United States. By custom electors are also residents of the\r\ndistrict from which they are chosen.\r\n\r\nThe President of the United States must be a natural-born citizen of\r\nthe United States and must be at least thirty-five years of age. He\r\nmust also have been a resident of the United States for fourteen\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n512. COMPENSATION.--The President's salary is determined by Congress,\r\nbut the amount may be neither increased nor decreased for the existing\r\npresidential term. Between 1789 and 1873 the presidential salary was\r\n$25,000, and in 1873 it was increased to $50,000 a year. Since 1909\r\nthe President has received an annual salary of $75,000, plus an\r\nallowance for travelling expenses and the upkeep of the White House or\r\nExecutive Mansion.\r\n\r\n513. TERM AND SUCCESSION.--The President-elect is inaugurated on the\r\n4th of March following his election, and serves until the 4th of March\r\nfour years later. By custom, though not by law, he is limited to two\r\nterms.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution provides that in case the President is removed by\r\nimpeachment, death, resignation, or inability, his duties shall\r\ndevolve upon the Vice President. In 1886 the Presidential Succession\r\nAct provided that in case of the inability of both President and Vice\r\nPresident the Cabinet officers shall succeed in the following order:\r\nSecretary of State, Secretary of the Treasury, Secretary of War,\r\nAttorney-General, Postmaster-General, Secretary of the Navy, and\r\nSecretary of the Interior. No Cabinet officer has ever succeeded to\r\nthe Presidency, but Presidents Tyler, Fillmore, Johnson, Arthur, and\r\nRoosevelt were formerly Vice Presidents who ascended to the Presidency\r\nbecause of the death of the chief executive.\r\n\r\n514. THE VICE PRESIDENT.--The Vice President of the United States is\r\nelected in the same manner and by the same electors as the President,\r\nwith this exception: The failure of any Vice-Presidential candidate to\r\nreceive a majority of the electoral votes permits the Vice President\r\nto be chosen by the Senate from the two candidates receiving the\r\nhighest number of electoral votes. The qualifications for the Vice\r\nPresident are the same as for the President. The Vice Presidents\r\nsalary is $12,000 a year.\r\n\r\nAside from the fact that he may succeed the President there is little\r\nto be said about the Vice President. He presides over the Senate, but\r\nhe is not a member of that body. He can neither appoint committees,\r\nnor even vote, except in case of a tie. Vice Presidents have generally\r\nexerted little influence upon national affairs. During President\r\nWilson's second term, neither the President's extended absence in\r\nEurope, nor his serious illness at home, operated to increase the\r\ninfluence of the Vice President. Under President Harding's\r\nadministration, however, Vice President Coolidge was accorded\r\nconsiderable recognition, including the privilege of sitting in the\r\nPresident's Cabinet meetings.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. DUTIES AND POWERS OP THE PRESIDENT\r\n\r\n515. GENERAL STATUS OF THE PRESIDENT--The President of the United\r\nStates acts as the head of the executive branch of government. Since\r\nthe executive is independent of the other two branches, the President\r\nis subject to the control of neither legislature nor judiciary. The\r\nPresident cannot be arrested for any cause whatsoever. No ordinary\r\ncourt has jurisdiction over the Chief Magistrate, though misconduct\r\nmay result in his being impeached by the Senate of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe President enjoys extensive powers, some of which are enumerated in\r\nthe Constitution, [Footnote: Article II] and others of which he has\r\nacquired by the force of custom. These powers are divisible into four\r\ngroups, which may be discussed in the following order: War powers,\r\npowers with reference to foreign affairs, administrative powers, and\r\nlegislative powers.\r\n\r\n516. WAR POWERS OF THE PRESIDENT.--Section II of Article II of the\r\nConstitution provides that the President shall be \"commander-in-chief\r\nof the army and navy of the United States, and of the militia of the\r\nseveral states when called into actual service of the United States.\"\r\nIn pursuance of this power the President controls and directs the\r\nnation's military and naval forces, and appoints all army and naval\r\nofficers. [Footnote: In time of war, the President may dismiss these\r\nofficers at will; in time of peace, however, they are removed by\r\ncourt-martial.] The execution of the military law under which the army\r\nand navy are governed is also directed by the President. The President\r\nmay call out the state militia, when in his judgment such action is\r\nnecessary in order to suppress insurrection, repel invasion, or\r\nenforce the laws. In case of war with foreign countries, the President\r\nas commander-in-chief assumes full direction of hostilities.\r\n\r\nSo long as he acts within the bounds of international law, the\r\nPresident may do anything which he deems necessary to weaken the power\r\nof the enemy. In the exercise of this right President Lincoln\r\nblockaded the southern ports during the Civil War, suspended the writ\r\nof _habeas corpus_, declared martial law in many districts, and freed\r\nthe slaves by proclamation. During the World War (1917-1921), the\r\npowers of President Wilson were greatly expanded. For the purpose of\r\nbringing the struggle with Germany to a successful termination,\r\nCongress conferred upon the President large powers of control over\r\nfood, fuel, shipbuilding, and the export trade. The railway,\r\ntelegraph, and wireless systems were taken over by the government\r\nunder the President's war powers.\r\n\r\nAn important phase of the President's war powers is the constitutional\r\ncharge to take care that the laws be faithfully executed. Usually the\r\nadministration of law is a peaceful process, but when the civil\r\nauthorities are rendered powerless by persons defying Federal law, the\r\nPresident may use his military power to restore order. On three\r\nnotable occasions the President has enforced the laws by the use or\r\ndisplay of military force. In 1794 President Washington called out the\r\nmilitia of four states to suppress the Whiskey Rebellion. During the\r\nCivil War, President Lincoln resorted to military force to execute the\r\nlaws. Again, in 1894, President Cleveland used regular troops to\r\nprevent railway strikers in Chicago from interfering with the Federal\r\nmails.\r\n\r\n517. CONTROL OVER FOREIGN AFFAIRS.--The Constitution vests in the\r\nPresident the power to negotiate treaties and conventions with foreign\r\nnations. In practice the President usually acts through the Secretary\r\nof State. During the process of negotiation it is customary for the\r\nPresident to consult with the Senate committee on foreign relations,\r\nas well as with the leaders of the senatorial majority. Such\r\nconsultation is a wise step, because no treaty may become law unless\r\nratified by the Senate.\r\n\r\nThe President receives diplomatic representatives from foreign\r\ncountries. This is largely a ceremonial duty, but it may involve\r\nserious consequences. When the independence of a foreign country is in\r\ndoubt, or when the representative of any nation is personally\r\nobjectionable to our government, the President may refuse to receive\r\nthe foreign representative. In case relations between this and a\r\nforeign country become strained, or in case the representative of a\r\nforeign power is guilty of misconduct, the President may request the\r\nwithdrawal of, or may even dismiss, the foreign representative. This\r\nseverance of diplomatic relations may lead to war.\r\n\r\nThe President has the further power to appoint diplomatic\r\nrepresentatives to foreign countries. We send ambassadors to the more\r\nimportant countries, ministers-resident to most countries, envoys\r\nextraordinary or ministers-plenipotentiary to several countries, and\r\ncommissioners for special purposes. In the absence of the permanent\r\ndiplomatic representative some minor officer takes temporary charge,\r\nand is known as the _chargÚ d'affaires ad interim_. All of the\r\nPresident's diplomatic appointments must be confirmed by the Senate,\r\nbut the President acting alone may remove any diplomatic officer. Such\r\nremoval is at the pleasure of the President. The term of office\r\nenjoyed by diplomatic representatives is not fixed by law, but due to\r\nthe influence of the spoils system, it often terminates when a new\r\nPresident assumes office.\r\n\r\nBesides diplomatic officers, who are charged with political duties,\r\nour foreign service comprises various grades of consuls, or commercial\r\nrepresentatives. The President and the Senate likewise choose consular\r\nofficers, but from lists of persons who have qualified under the merit\r\nsystem. Promotion and removal are determined by Civil Service rules.\r\n\r\n518. ADMINISTRATIVE POWERS OF THE PRESIDENT.--The chief\r\nadministrative function of the President is to carry into effect the\r\nlaws of the United States. In the discharge of this duty the President\r\nis aided by a large number of subordinate officials, who, directly or\r\nindirectly, are responsible to him as head of the administration.\r\nAltogether there are more than half a million officials in the\r\nexecutive civil service of the United States.\r\n\r\nOver the appointment of these numerous officers the President has a\r\nvarying measure of control.\r\n\r\nHe alone appoints a few executive officials, such as his private\r\nsecretary and the members of his Cabinet. The latter are nominally\r\nchosen by the President and the Senate, but in practice the Senate\r\nuniversally approves Cabinet appointments sent in by the President.\r\nOfficers in this first group may be removed only by the President.\r\n\r\nThe President and the Senate together select about 12,000 of the more\r\nimportant executive officers. These include diplomatic agents, Federal\r\njudges, most military and naval officers, collectors of customs and\r\ninternal revenues, and many others. In the case of minor positions to\r\nbe filled within a congressional district, the President usually\r\nconfers with the Representative from that district, if that\r\nRepresentative is of the President's party. If such Representative is\r\nnot of the President's party, the candidate for the position is really\r\nselected by the Senators from the proper state. [Footnote: Provided,\r\nof course, that these Senators belong to the same political party as\r\nthe President. ] The more important positions in this group are filled\r\nby the Senators from the state in which the vacancy exists, the\r\nPresident ratifying such selections as a matter of course. Officers in\r\nthis second group are removable only by the President.\r\n\r\nMore than 300,000 of the minor executive positions are now filled by\r\nthe Civil Service Commission. Persons entering office through the\r\nmerit system, may be removed only for a cause which will promote the\r\nefficiency of the service.\r\n\r\nIn addition to his administrative duties, the President has the power\r\nto grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States,\r\nexcept in the case of impeachment. A pardon fully exempts the\r\nindividual from the punishment imposed upon him by law; a reprieve, on\r\nthe other hand, is simply a temporary suspension of the execution of a\r\nsentence.\r\n\r\n519. LEGISLATIVE POWERS OF THE PRESIDENT.--Though primarily an\r\nexecutive officer, the President enjoys important powers over\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\nThe President may convene either or both houses of Congress on\r\nextraordinary occasions. For example, he may call an extra session of\r\nCongress to consider such questions as the tariff, currency reform, or\r\na treaty.\r\n\r\nThe President has the right to send messages to Congress from time to\r\ntime during his term. The recommendations contained in these messages\r\nexert some direct influence upon legislation, and are important in\r\nformulating public opinion outside of Congress.\r\n\r\nIndirectly the President exerts a considerable influence upon\r\nlegislation by bringing political pressure to bear upon the\r\nCongressional leaders of his party. He also exerts some influence upon\r\nlegislation by the use of the patronage which accompanies his\r\nappointing power. This influence is important as breaking down the\r\nbarriers between the executive and legislative branches of government.\r\n\r\nThe President may issue ordinances which have the force of law. As\r\ncommander-in-chief of the army and navy, he may issue ordinances for\r\ntheir regulation. In pursuance of the duty to enforce the laws, the\r\nPresident may issue ordinances prescribing uniform means for the\r\nenforcement of the statutes. He may issue ordinances for specific\r\npurposes, as, for example, Congress in 1912 authorized the President\r\nto issue legislative ordinances for the government of the Canal Zone.\r\n\r\nVery important is the President's veto power. The President may veto\r\nany bill or joint resolution passed by Congress, with the exception of\r\njoint resolutions proposing Constitutional amendments. But the\r\nPresident must veto the bill as a whole, and not particular items.\r\nEven though vetoed by the President, a bill may still become law by\r\nbeing passed by a two-thirds vote in each house of Congress. In spite\r\nof these restrictions, the President exerts a considerable influence\r\nupon legislation by the use of the veto, or by the threat that he will\r\nemploy it. Most authorities regard the veto power as a wholesome check\r\nupon harmful and unwise legislation.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS ON THE TEXT\r\n\r\n1.

DEVELOPMENT OF THE FEDERAL EXECUTIVE.--The President is the head\r\nof the Federal executive, but in the performance of his numerous\r\nadministrative duties he is aided by a number of subordinate officers.\r\n\r\nNo executive departments were directly established by the\r\nConstitution, but that document evidently assumes their existence, for\r\nit clearly states that the President \"may require the opinion, in\r\nwriting, of the principal officer in each of the executive\r\ndepartments, upon any subject relating to the duties of their\r\nrespective offices.\" [Footnote: Article II, Section II, of the\r\nConstitution.]\r\n\r\nPresident Washington was authorized by Congress to appoint three\r\nassistants: a Secretary of State, a Secretary of the Treasury, and a\r\nSecretary of War. With the development of governmental functions,\r\nadditional departments have been created. Congress established the\r\nPost Office Department in 1794, the Navy Department in 1798, the\r\nDepartment of the Interior in 1849, the Department of Justice in 1870,\r\nthe Department of Agriculture in 1889, the Department of Commerce in\r\n1903, and the Department of Labor in 1913. At present, then, there are\r\nten Federal executive departments, all of them under the direct\r\ncontrol of the President.\r\n\r\n521. THE CABINET.--The heads of these ten departments are appointed by\r\nthe President, nominally with the consent of the Senate. They may be\r\nremoved only by the President, and by him at will. Neither in the\r\nConstitution nor in the statutes of Congress is there provision for a\r\nCabinet, but as the result of custom which has been formulating since\r\nWashington's second term the heads of the Federal executive\r\ndepartments have come to constitute, in their collective capacity, the\r\nPresident's Cabinet. Cabinet meetings are generally held twice a week,\r\nor oftener, as the President desires.\r\n\r\nThe American Cabinet should not be confused with the Cabinet in Great\r\nBritain and other European countries. In Europe the Cabinet is\r\ngenerally a parliamentary ministry, that is to say, a group of men\r\nchosen from the majority party in the legislature. These Cabinet\r\nmembers, or ministers, sit in the legislature, propose laws, and\r\ndefend their measures on the floor. They are held responsible for the\r\nnational administration. This means that when the majority of the\r\nlegislature fails to support them they are expected to resign, in\r\norder that the opposition party may form a new Cabinet.\r\n\r\nQuite different is the American Cabinet. This body is advisory only,\r\nand the President may disregard the advice of any or all of its\r\nmembers. The Cabinet in this country is accountable only to the\r\nPresident. The attitude of Congress toward Cabinet officers has\r\nnothing to do with the tenure of office of these executive heads.\r\nCabinet members do not sit in Congress; they do not, in the capacity\r\nof Cabinet officers, introduce or defend legislation; and they are not\r\nheld responsible for the administration.\r\n\r\n522. HEADS OF DEPARTMENTS AS ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICERS.--Collectively\r\nthe heads of the ten executive departments act as the President's\r\nCabinet; individually they administer their respective departments.\r\nThough responsible to the President and at all times working under his\r\ndirection, the heads of departments are allowed a wide range of\r\nindependence. Department heads may appoint and remove at will a large\r\nnumber of minor officers in their respective departments, though of\r\nlate years this power has been considerably restricted by Civil\r\nService rules. The exact scope of the work of the various departments\r\nis largely denned by law. Within the limits thus set, the head of the\r\ndepartment is free to make regulations affecting the conduct of\r\ndepartmental business. To expedite business, the work of each\r\ndepartment is divided and subdivided among numerous bureaus, boards,\r\nand commissions, functioning under the general direction of the head\r\nof the department.\r\n\r\n523. THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE.--Without doubt the most important of the\r\nsubordinate executive officers is the Secretary of State. His most\r\npressing duty is to conduct foreign affairs in accordance with the\r\nwishes of the President. In pursuance of this duty, the Secretary of\r\nState issues instructions to diplomatic and consular officers, issues\r\npassports to American citizens going abroad, and otherwise exercises\r\ncontrol of matters touching foreign relations.\r\n\r\nImportant domestic duties devolve upon the Secretary of State. When\r\nthe President desires to communicate with the Governors of the several\r\nstates, he acts through the Secretary of State. The Secretary is the\r\ncustodian of the Great Seal of the United States. It is he who\r\noversees the publication of the Federal statutes. The Secretary of\r\nState likewise has charge of the archives containing the originals of\r\nall laws, treaties, and foreign correspondence.\r\n\r\nMuch of the work of the Department of State is performed through\r\nbureaus, the titles of which indicate their respective functions. Of\r\nthese bureaus the following are the more important: the diplomatic\r\nbureau, the consular bureau, the bureau of accounts, the bureau of\r\nindexes and archives, the bureau of rolls and library, the bureau of\r\nappointments, and the bureau of citizenship. Each of these bureaus is\r\nheaded by a chief who is directly responsible to the Secretary of\r\nState. In addition to these chiefs of bureaus, the Secretary is aided\r\nby three assistant secretaries of state.\r\n\r\n524. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY.--Supervision of the national finances\r\nis the chief business of the Secretary of the Treasury. The Secretary\r\nannually submits to Congress estimates of probable receipts and\r\nexpenditures, and supervises the collection of customs and internal\r\nrevenues. He also issues warrants for all moneys paid out of the\r\ntreasury.\r\n\r\nThe scope of the department's work may be indicated by an enumeration\r\nof its chief officers. These include the Secretary himself, three\r\nassistant secretaries, six auditors, the treasurer, the comptroller\r\nof the treasury, the director of the mint, the register, the\r\ncomptroller of the currency, the commissioner of internal revenue, the\r\ndirector of the bureau of engraving and printing, the chief of the\r\nsecret-service department, the captain commandant of the coast guard,\r\nthe superintendent of the life-saving service, the surgeon-general of\r\nthe public health service, the supervising architect, and the farm\r\nloan commissioner.\r\n\r\n525. THE DEPARTMENT OF WAR.--National defense is the chief concern of\r\nthe Secretary of War. Coast fortifications, the supervision of\r\nnavigation, and river and harbor improvements fall within the scope of\r\nthe department. Our insular possessions are administered by the\r\nSecretary of War. It is also the duty of this officer to prepare\r\nestimates of the expenses of his department, to supervise all\r\nexpenditures for the support and transportation of the army, and to\r\ntake charge of the issuance of orders for the movement of troops. In\r\naddition, he has charge of the Military Academy at West Point, and\r\nrecommends all appointments and promotions in the army service.\r\n\r\nUnder the Secretary of War are grouped a number of administrative\r\nbureaus, each headed by an army officer detailed for a period of four\r\nyears. Of these officers the following are the more important: the\r\ninspector-general, the quartermaster-general, the adjutant general,\r\nthe surgeon-general, the chief of engineers, the chief of ordnance,\r\nthe chief signal officer, the chief of the coast artillery, the judge\r\nadvocate general, the provost-marshal general, and the chief of the\r\nbureau of insular affairs.\r\n\r\n526. THE DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY.--The Department of the Navy is\r\nlikewise concerned with national defense. While less important than\r\nthe Department of War, the Department of the Navy is steadily gaining\r\nin prestige. The Department is in charge of a Secretary, aided by an\r\nassistant secretary. It is the duty of the Department of the Navy to\r\nsuperintend the construction and armament of war vessels, and in\r\naddition exercise a supervisory control over the naval service. The\r\nNaval Academy at Annapolis and the Naval War College at Newport are in\r\ncharge of the Department of the Navy.\r\n\r\nThe administrative work of the Department is carried on by seven\r\nbureaus, most of them in charge of line officers of the Navy, working\r\ndirectly under the Secretary. These bureaus are as follows: the bureau\r\nof navigation, the bureau of ordnance, the bureau of yards and docks,\r\nthe bureau of supplies and accounts, the bureau of steam engineering,\r\nthe bureau of medicine and surgery, and the bureau of construction and\r\nrepairs.\r\n\r\n527. THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.--This Department is headed by the\r\nAttorney-General, who acts as the chief legal adviser of the National\r\ngovernment. It is his duty to represent the government in all cases to\r\nwhich the United States is a party. It is he who conducts proceedings\r\nagainst corporations or individuals who violate the Federal laws.\r\nGeneral supervision over all Federal district attorneys and marshals\r\nis exercised by the Attorney-General. This officer likewise examines\r\nthe titles of lands which the government intends to purchase. The\r\nAttorney-General has a supervisory charge of the penal and reformatory\r\ninstitutions which are Federal in character. Applications for pardons\r\nby the President are investigated by the Attorney-General. Still\r\nanother of his duties is to superintend the codification of the\r\nFederal criminal laws.\r\n\r\nIn these various duties the Attorney-General is assisted by an under-\r\nofficer known as the solicitor-general.\r\n\r\n528. THE POST OFFICE DEPARTMENT.--This Department, headed by the\r\nPostmaster-General, has general charge of the postal service. The\r\nPostmaster-General awards contracts for the transportation of the\r\nmails, and directs the management of the domestic and foreign mail\r\nservice. The handling of money orders, the parcels post system, and\r\nthe postal savings banks come under the control of the Postmaster-\r\nGeneral. Of great importance is the power of this officer to bar from\r\nthe mails publications which are fraudulent or otherwise obnoxious.\r\n\r\nWorking under the Postmaster-General are four assistant postmasters-\r\ngeneral, each in general charge of a group of services within the\r\ndepartment.\r\n\r\n529. DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR.--Aided by two assistant secretaries,\r\nthe Secretary of the Interior performs a number of important\r\nfunctions. He has charge of all public lands, including national\r\nparks. The handling of Indian affairs constitutes one of his duties.\r\nThe territories of Alaska and Hawaii come under the direct supervision\r\nof this department.\r\n\r\nMany miscellaneous functions are performed by the various bureaus\r\nwithin the department. Patents, pensions, and the geological survey\r\ncome within the purview of the department. The Secretary of the\r\nInterior has charge of the distribution of government appropriations\r\nto various educational institutions. A general supervision over a\r\nnumber of charitable institutions within the District of Columbia is\r\nalso exercised by this officer.\r\n\r\n530. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE.--All matters pertaining to agriculture\r\nin the widest sense are the concern of the Department of Agriculture.\r\nUnder the direction of the Secretary the Department issues a large\r\nnumber of scientific and technical publications, including the\r\nAgricultural Yearbook, the series of Farmers' Bulletins, the Monthly\r\nWeather Review, and the Crop Reporter. Quarantine stations for\r\nimported cattle, and the inspection of domestic meats and imported\r\nfood products are concerns of the various bureaus within the\r\nDepartment. Of great importance is the work of the weather bureau in\r\nsending out storm, flood, frost, and drought warnings.\r\n\r\nAn increasingly important phase of the Department's work is the Forest\r\nService, the work of which has been described in Chapter XXX. An\r\nimportant bureau is the bureau of animal industry, which combats\r\nanimal diseases and gives advice concerning the best breeds of poultry\r\nand cattle. The bureau of plant industry ransacks the world for new\r\ncrops suitable for our soils, and gives fruit-growers and farmers\r\nadvice concerning plant parasites. Insect pests are the concern of the\r\nentomology division. Additional functions of the Department of\r\nAgriculture may be indicated by an enumeration of some of the more\r\nimportant of its remaining bureaus and divisions. These include the\r\nbureau of chemistry, the bureau of soils, the bureau of statistics,\r\nthe bureau of crop estimates, the office of public roads and rural\r\nengineering, the Federal horticultural board, and the bureau of\r\nmarkets.\r\n\r\n531. THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE.--In 1913 what for ten years had been\r\nknown as the Department of Commerce and Labor was divided into two\r\nseparate departments, a Department of Commerce and a Department of\r\nLabor.\r\n\r\nThe chief duty of the Department of Commerce is to foster the foreign\r\nand domestic commerce of the United States. To promote our mining,\r\nmanufacturing and fishing industries, and to develop our\r\ntransportation facilities are, therefore, among the aims of this\r\ndepartment. The census, the coast survey and lighthouses, and\r\nsteamboat inspection are concerns of the Department of Commerce. The\r\nscope of the Department, which is increasing rapidly, may be indicated\r\nby an enumeration of the more important bureaus grouped within it.\r\nThese include the bureau of foreign and domestic commerce, the bureau\r\nof census, the bureau of lighthouses, the bureau of coast and geodetic\r\nsurvey, the steamboat inspection service, the bureau of navigation,\r\nthe bureau of standards, and the bureau of fisheries.\r\n\r\n532. THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR.--Though at present the functions of the\r\nDepartment of Labor are fewer than those of the other Departments,\r\nthey are being rapidly expanded by the extension of government\r\ninterest in industry. The Department is concerned with practically all\r\nmatters which affect labor conditions in the United States.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Labor collects and publishes information upon all\r\nsubjects connected with labor and capital, the hours and wages of\r\nlabor, and methods of improving the condition of the working classes.\r\nIt seeks to encourage industrial good will, and to adjust labor\r\ndisputes peaceably. An important bureau within the Department is the\r\nbureau of immigration, which, under the direction of the commissioner-\r\ngeneral of immigration, is concerned with the administration of our\r\nimmigration laws. The bureau of naturalization keeps a record of\r\nimmigrants, and supervises their naturalization. Of growing importance\r\nis the children's bureau, which investigates matters having to do with\r\nchild labor, infant mortality, orphanage, and the work of the juvenile\r\ncourts.\r\n\r\n533. MISCELLANEOUS BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS.--In addition to the\r\nexecutive departments which have been briefly discussed, the Federal\r\nadministration includes many independent boards, bureaus, and\r\ncommissions which perform duties not assigned to any of the ten\r\ndepartments. These agencies have been established from time to time\r\nunder the authority of Congressional statutes. The chiefs of the\r\nbureaus and the members of the boards and commissions are appointed by\r\nthe President and the Senate, most of them for a term ranging between\r\nsix and twelve years. These officials are largely experts, who happily\r\nare sufficiently exempt from the spoils system to stand a fair chance\r\nof surviving a change of administration.\r\n\r\nAmong the more important of these boards and commissions are the\r\nfollowing: The Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Farm Loan Board, the\r\nFederal Board for Vocational Education, the Federal Trade Commission,\r\nthe Interstate Commerce Commission, the United States Tariff\r\nCommission, and the Civil Service Commission. The nature and functions\r\nof most of these administrative agencies have been discussed elsewhere\r\nin the text, and need not be gone into here.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS ON THE TEXT\r\n\r\n1.

CONGRESS CONSISTS OF TWO HOUSES.--The National legislature, or\r\nCongress, consists of a Senate or upper chamber, and a House of\r\nRepresentatives or lower chamber.\r\n\r\nSeveral factors are responsible for this division of Congress into two\r\nhouses. Undoubtedly the framers of the Constitution were influenced by\r\nthe fact that the British Parliament and nearly all of the colonial\r\nlegislatures consisted of two houses. A second factor is that in the\r\nopinion of the Fathers, a two-chambered legislature would allow each\r\nhouse to act as a check upon the other. Finally, the creation of a\r\ntwo-chambered legislature was necessary in order to reconcile the\r\nconflicting desires of the large and the small states. During the\r\nConstitutional Convention two opposing factions were brought together\r\nby the creation of a two-chambered legislature, in the upper house of\r\nwhich the states were to be represented equally, and in the lower\r\nhouse of which representation was to be on the basis of population.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. THE SENATE\r\n\r\n535. TERM AND QUALIFICATIONS OF SENATORS.--Two Senators are chosen\r\nfrom each state, regardless of population. The senatorial term is six\r\nyears. In order to make the Senate a permanent body, membership is so\r\narranged that one third of the Senators retire every two years. The\r\nFederal Constitution provides that Senators must be at least thirty\r\nyears of age. In addition, a Senator must have been nine years a\r\ncitizen of the United States, and he must be an inhabitant of the\r\nstate from which he is chosen. The Senate alone is judge of the\r\nqualifications of its members.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the Senate, two disqualifications are imposed by the\r\nFederal Constitution. No one holding a Federal office may stand for\r\nelection as Senator. Nor may any person become a Senator who has taken\r\npart in a rebellion against the United States after having taken an\r\noath as a government officer to support the Constitution.\r\n\r\n536. THE ELECTION OF SENATORS.--Previous to 1913 Senators were chosen\r\nby the various state legislatures, according to the provisions of the\r\nFederal Constitution. [Footnote: Article I, Section III.] This method\r\nproved unsatisfactory. Demoralizing political battles often took place\r\nin the state legislatures in the effort to select the states' Senators\r\nto Congress. Sometimes, even after a long struggle, no candidate was\r\nable to secure a majority, and a deadlock occurred. Thus, on the one\r\nhand, a state might be deprived of representation in the Senate for\r\nweeks or months, while, on the other hand, the attention of the\r\nlegislature was so distracted by the senatorial struggle that purely\r\nstate interests suffered. As the result of a long agitation growing\r\nout of these evils, the Federal Constitution was amended (1913) to\r\npermit the direct election of Senators.\r\n\r\nSince 1913, then, any person may vote directly for Senator who, under\r\nthe laws of his state, is qualified to vote for members of the more\r\nnumerous branch of the state legislature. When, for any reason, a\r\nvacancy occurs in the representation of any state in the Senate, the\r\nGovernor of the state issues a writ of election to fill such vacancy.\r\nProvided the state legislature grants the authority, the Governor also\r\nmay appoint some person to serve as Senator until the vacancy is\r\nfilled by popular election. Senators are generally reflected, and at\r\nthe present time the average term of service is not six, but about\r\ntwelve years.\r\n\r\n537. PRIVILEGES AND IMMUNITIES OF SENATORS.--By the terms of the\r\nConstitution, Senators are paid out of the national treasury an amount\r\nto be determined by statute. At present both Senators and members of\r\nthe House of Representatives receive $7500 a year, plus an allowance\r\nfor travelling expenses, clerk hire, and stationery. Except in case of\r\ntreason or breach of the peace, Senators and Representatives are\r\nimmune to arrest during attendance at the sessions of their respective\r\nhouses, and in going to and returning from the same. Both Senators and\r\nRepresentatives likewise enjoy freedom of speech and debate in their\r\nrespective houses. In either chamber only the house itself may call\r\nmembers to account for their statements during the legislative\r\nsession. No member of Congress may be prosecuted in the courts for\r\nlibel or slander on account of statements made in Congress, or for the\r\nofficial publication of what he has said during the legislative\r\nsession.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. THE HOUSE or REPRESENTATIVES\r\n\r\n538. MEMBERSHIP OF THE HOUSE.--Since the Senate is composed of two\r\nSenators from each state, its membership has been relatively stable.\r\nFor a number of years there have been 96 Senators, two for each of the\r\nforty-eight states of the Union.\r\n\r\nThe membership of the House of Representatives, on the other hand, is\r\nsteadily increasing, because based upon population. The number of\r\nRepresentatives to which any state is entitled depends upon its\r\npopulation as ascertained every ten years by a Federal census. After\r\neach census Congress determines the number of Representatives of which\r\nthe House shall consist. The population of the United States is then\r\ndivided by this number, and the quotient is taken as the ratio of\r\nrepresentation. The population of each state is then divided by this\r\nratio to discover the number of Representatives to which it is\r\nentitled. As a single exception to this rule, the Constitution\r\nprovides that each state shall have at least one Representative\r\nregardless of population. Thus Nevada, Arizona, Wyoming, and Delaware\r\nare entitled to one Representative, whereas according to the above\r\nrule they would now be denied representation.\r\n\r\nThe present membership of the House of Representatives is 435.\r\n\r\n539. WHO MAY VOTE FOR REPRESENTATIVES.--The Federal Constitution\r\nprovides that members of the House of Representatives shall be chosen\r\nby persons who, in their respective states, are qualified to vote for\r\nmembers of the more numerous branch of the state legislature. Most\r\nmale and female citizens over twenty-one years of age may vote for\r\nmembers of this more numerous branch, and hence for Representatives to\r\nCongress. In a number of states, however, educational, property and\r\nother qualifications are imposed. Certain types of criminals, the\r\ninsane, and the otherwise defective are regularly excluded. [Footnote:\r\nFor a fuller discussion of the suffrage, see Chapter XXXIII.]\r\n\r\n540. QUALIFICATIONS OF REPRESENTATIVES.--The Federal Constitution\r\ndeclares that a Representative must be at least twenty-five years of\r\nage. He must have been a citizen for at least seven years, and at the\r\ntime of his candidacy must also be an inhabitant of the state from\r\nwhich he is chosen. The House itself determines whether or not these\r\nqualifications have been met. No state may add to the constitutional\r\nqualifications, but through the force of custom a Representative is\r\nalmost always a resident of the district which he is chosen to\r\nrepresent.\r\n\r\n541. ELECTION OF REPRESENTATIVES.--The Federal Constitution permits\r\nthe legislatures of the several states to regulate the time, manner\r\nand place of elections for its Representatives to Congress.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Constitution reserves to Congress the right to alter\r\nthese regulations at its discretion. This right has been exercised\r\nseveral times. Congressional statute has provided that Representatives\r\nshall be elected on the Tuesday following the first Monday in November\r\nof even-numbered years, and that the election shall be by written or\r\nprinted ballot. It is also in accordance with Congressional statute\r\nthat Representatives are selected on the district plan, one\r\nRepresentative being chosen from each Congressional district in the\r\nstate. Congress has furthermore provided that these districts shall be\r\nof as nearly equal population as possible, and that they shall be\r\ncomposed of \"compact and contiguous territory.\"\r\n\r\n542. THE CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT.--Subject to the above limitations the\r\nlegislature of each state may determine the boundaries of its\r\nCongressional districts. The state legislature finds it necessary to\r\nredistrict the state if the decennial census shows that the population\r\nof the state has increased unequally in various sections, or in case\r\nthe apportionment act of Congress changes the state's representation.\r\n\r\nIn many cases states have redistricted their territory for\r\nillegitimate reasons. The Federal provision with reference to\r\ncontiguous territory has been loosely interpreted: in many cases\r\nterritory is held to be contiguous if it touches the district at any\r\npoint. The requirement that districts shall be of nearly equal\r\npopulation has often been disregarded altogether. Since the state\r\nlegislature is controlled by the political party having a majority,\r\nthe dominant party can arrange the district lines so as to secure a\r\nparty majority in the greatest possible number of districts. This is\r\ndone by concentrating the opposition votes in a few districts which\r\nwould be hostile under any circumstances, and so grouping the\r\nremaining votes as to insure for the dominant party a majority in\r\nnumerous districts.\r\n\r\n543. GERRYMANDERING.--The result of this illegitimate redistricting\r\nhas been to create districts of great irregularity. In 1812, when\r\nElbridge Gerry was Governor of Massachusetts, the Republican party was\r\nin control of the state legislature. In districting the state so as to\r\nwin for themselves as many districts as possible, the Republicans gave\r\none of the Congressional districts a dragon-like appearance. To the\r\nsuggestion of a famous painter that this looked like a salamander, a\r\nlocal wit replied that it was more nearly a Gerrymander. The term\r\n\"gerrymander\" has since continued to be used to designate this type of\r\nillegitimate redistricting. [Footnote: For the relation of\r\ngerrymandering to the problem of minority representation, see Chapter\r\nXXXV.]\r\n\r\n544. TERM OF REPRESENTATIVES.--Representatives are elected for two\r\nyears, the legal term commencing on the 4th of March following the\r\nelection. Except in the case of a special session, the actual service\r\nof Representatives does not commence until the first Monday in\r\nDecember, thirteen months after election. Members are frequently\r\nreŰlected, the average term being about four years. When for any\r\nreason a vacancy occurs in the representation from any state, the\r\nGovernor may, on the authority of the Federal Constitution, issue a\r\nwrit of election to fill the vacancy. A special election is then held\r\nin the district in which the vacancy has occurred, and the\r\nRepresentative so chosen serves for the remainder of the\r\nterm. [Footnote: The privileges and immunities of Representatives are\r\nsimilar to those of Senators. See Section 537 of this chapter.]\r\n\r\n\r\nC. THE POWERS OF CONGRESS\r\n\r\n545. SPECIAL POWERS OF THE SENATE.--Of the three powers exercised\r\nexclusively by the Senate, the power to approve treaties is one of the\r\nmost important. All treaties negotiated by the President must be\r\napproved by a two-thirds vote of the Senate before becoming law. The\r\ntreaty may be approved or rejected as a whole, or it may be rejected\r\nin part, and additional articles recommended as amendments. If changed\r\nin form or content by the Senate the treaty does not become law until\r\nboth the President and the foreign power have assented to the\r\namendment or change.\r\n\r\nIn order to become valid, a large number of Presidential appointments\r\nmust receive the approval of the Senate. [Footnote: See Chapter XL,\r\nSection 518.]\r\n\r\nThe Senate exercises a special judicial function in that it may sit as\r\na court of impeachment for the trial of persons whom the House of\r\nRepresentatives has formally charged with treason, bribery, or other\r\nhigh crimes and misdemeanors. Excluding military and naval officers,\r\nwho are tried by court-martial, and excluding also members of\r\nCongress, who are subject only to the rules of their respective\r\nhouses, all Federal officers are subject to impeachment. Impeachment\r\nrequires a two-thirds vote of the Senators present. Removal from\r\noffice and disqualification to hold any office under the United States\r\nis the heaviest penalty which can be imposed upon an impeached\r\nofficial.\r\n\r\n546. SPECIAL POWERS OF THE HOUSE.--The House likewise enjoys three\r\nspecial powers.\r\n\r\nOne of these is the right to elect a President of the United States in\r\ncase no candidate has a majority of the electoral votes. This has\r\nhappened only twice, in 1800, and again in 1824.\r\n\r\nThe Federal Constitution provides that all revenue bills must\r\noriginate in the lower house. However, the Senate has come to share\r\nthis power through its power to amend such bills.\r\n\r\nThe House of Representatives has the sole power to prefer charges of\r\nimpeachment, that is to say, to present what may be called the\r\nindictment against the accused official. The case is then tried before\r\nthe Senate, the House appointing a committee of its own members to act\r\nas the prosecuting agency.\r\n\r\n547. GENERAL SURVEY OF THE POWERS OF CONGRESS.--The powers of\r\nCongress, _i.e._ the two houses acting together, are of two kinds:\r\nFirst, express powers, by which is meant those specifically enumerated\r\nin the Federal Constitution; and second, implied powers, by which is\r\nmeant those which are incident to express powers and necessary to\r\ntheir execution. The foundation of the doctrine of implied powers is\r\nthe constitutional clause [Footnote: Article I, Section VIII, of the\r\nConstitution.] which authorizes Congress to make all laws \"necessary\r\nand proper\" for carrying out the powers granted it by the Federal\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\nGrouping express and implied powers together, the more important\r\npowers of Congress may be summarized as follows:\r\n\r\n_Revenue and expenditures_. Congress has the power to lay and collect\r\ntaxes, duties, imports, and excises, and to appropriate money in order\r\n\"to pay the debts and provide for the common defense and general\r\nwelfare of the United States.\" But indirect taxes must be uniform\r\nthroughout the United States, and all direct taxes, except income\r\ntaxes, must be apportioned among the states according to population. A\r\nfurther limitation is that Congress may not tax exports from any\r\nstate, nor levy upon the \"necessary instrumentalities\" of any state\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\n_National defense_. Here the powers of Congress are practically\r\nunlimited, except by the constitutional provisions that the President\r\nshall be commander-in-chief, and that military appropriations shall\r\nnot be made for more than two years. Congress can raise and support\r\narmies, create and maintain a navy, and provide for the organization\r\nand use of the state militia. Congress may also declare war, and make\r\nrules concerning captures on land and sea.\r\n\r\n_Foreign relations_. Congress as a body has little direct control over\r\nforeign relations, though the Senate shares the treaty-making power\r\nwith the President. But Congress has the power to create diplomatic\r\nand consular posts, as well as \"to define and punish piracies and\r\nfelonies committed on the high seas, and offences against the law of\r\nnations.\" Congress also exercises control over immigration and\r\nnaturalization.\r\n\r\n_Economic interests_. Congress may regulate commerce with foreign\r\ncountries, among the several states, and with the Indian tribes. The\r\nexclusive power to coin money, and otherwise control the monetary\r\nsystem, is vested in Congress. Congress may make uniform laws on\r\nbankruptcy throughout the United States, and fix the standards of\r\nweights and measures. The establishment of post offices and post\r\nroads, and the protection of authors and inventors through legislation\r\non patents and copyrights, are also functions of Congress.\r\n\r\n_Territories_. Congress has the power to dispose of, and make all\r\nneedful rules and regulations respecting, the territory or other\r\nproperty belonging to the United States. Congress likewise exercises\r\nexclusive control over the District of Columbia, and over all places\r\npurchased by the Federal government for the erection of forts,\r\narsenals, and similar buildings. Congress also has the right to\r\ndetermine the admission to the Union of new states, and \"to dispose of\r\nand make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or\r\nother property belonging to the United States.\"\r\n\r\n_Crime_. In criminal matters the power of Congress is slight. For\r\nexample, it cannot say what constitutes treason, since that crime is\r\ndefined by the Constitution. However, Congress may provide for the\r\npunishment of counterfeiters and persons committing crimes on the high\r\nseas or offences against international law. It may also define certain\r\ncrimes against Federal law, and prescribe penalties therefor.\r\n\r\n_Control over the judiciary_. The judiciary is an independent branch\r\nof government, but Congress may determine the number of Supreme Court\r\njudges, fix their salaries within certain limits, and define their\r\nappellate jurisdiction. Congress may also determine the jurisdiction,\r\nand define the procedure, of the inferior Federal courts.\r\n\r\n_Implied powers_. Last among the powers of Congress is the authority\r\ngranted to it by the Constitution to make all laws which shall be\r\ndeemed necessary and proper for carrying into execution the powers\r\nexpressly granted to Congress by the Constitution. It is under the\r\nauthority of this clause, that the implied powers of Congress have\r\nbeen so greatly expanded.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS ON THE TEXT\r\n\r\n1.

ORGANIZATION OF CONGRESS\r\n\r\n548. CONGRESSIONAL SESSIONS.--The Federal Constitution requires\r\nCongress to assemble at least once a year, and Congress has provided\r\nthat the date of meeting shall be the first Monday in December. In\r\naddition to such special sessions as may be called either by the\r\nPresident or by Congress itself, there are two regular sessions. One\r\nof these is the long session, from December of each odd year until\r\nCongress adjourns, generally sometime during the following summer. The\r\nother is the short session, beginning when Congress assembles in\r\nDecember of each even year, and ending at noon on the 4th of March\r\nfollowing.\r\n\r\nThe two houses of Congress jointly fix the time for adjournment, but\r\nin case they cannot agree upon this point, the President has the right\r\nto adjourn them to such time as he thinks fit. During the\r\ncongressional session, neither house may, without the consent of the\r\nother, adjourn for more than three days, nor to any other place than\r\nthat in which the two houses are sitting. Since 1800 congressional\r\nsessions have regularly been held at Washington, D. C., the National\r\ncapital.\r\n\r\n549. INTERNAL ORGANIZATION.--Each house of Congress has the right to\r\ndetermine its own rule of practice, punish members for disorderly\r\nconduct, and, by a two-thirds vote, expel a member. Members guilty of\r\nacts of violence or abusive language may be punished by a vote of\r\ncensure, or may be obliged to apologize to the house. For the\r\ncommission of a grave offense, a Congressman may be expelled from the\r\nhouse to which he was elected.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution requires that \"each house shall keep a journal of\r\nits proceedings, and from time to time publish the same, excepting\r\nsuch parts as may in their judgment require secrecy; and the yeas and\r\nnays of the members of either house shall, at the desire of one fifth\r\nof those present, be entered upon the journal.\" The object of this is\r\nto secure a permanent record of legislative action, as well as\r\npublicity of proceedings. The vote by yeas and nays fixes\r\nresponsibility for his vote upon each member by making it a matter of\r\npublic record. The _Congressional Record_, an official account of\r\nCongressional debates and proceedings, appears daily during\r\nCongressional sessions. This is supposedly a verbatim report of what\r\nis said in each house, but as a matter of fact members are allowed to\r\nedit and revise their remarks before these are printed. In the case of\r\nthe House, many of the published speeches have never been delivered at\r\nall.\r\n\r\n550. THE OFFICERS OF CONGRESS.--In the House of Representatives the\r\nchief officer is the Speaker, or presiding officer. The Speaker is\r\nchosen from the membership of the House by that body itself. As will\r\nbe pointed out shortly, this officer is an important personage.\r\n\r\nIn the Senate the Vice President of the United States acts as the\r\npresiding officer. In the absence of the Vice President, or in case\r\nthat officer succeeds to the Presidency, the Senate itself chooses a\r\npresident _pro tempore_ to occupy the chair. The presiding officer of\r\nthe Senate is much less powerful than the Speaker of the House, indeed\r\nhe is little more than a chairman or moderator.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of additional officers of Congress, who are chosen\r\nby the respective houses from outside their own membership. These\r\nofficers include a clerk, who in the Senate is called the secretary;\r\nthe door-keeper; the sergeant-at-arms; the postmaster; and the\r\nchaplain. Nominally these officers are chosen by each house, but as a\r\nmatter of practice the choice is made by the caucus of the majority\r\nparty, which is held a few days before the organization of each house.\r\n\r\n551. THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.--A few days before\r\nthe organization of the House, the caucus of the majority party\r\nsettles upon its choice for Speaker. The candidate chosen invariably\r\nreceives the solid vote of his party in the House, since it is a rule\r\nof the caucus that party members who take part in its discussions must\r\nabide by its decisions.\r\n\r\nAs chairman of the House, the Speaker performs the customary duties of\r\na presiding officer. He opens and closes the sittings of the House,\r\nmaintains order, and decides questions of parliamentary law. The\r\nSpeaker acts as the official representative of the House in its\r\ncollective capacity, and authenticates all official proceedings by his\r\nsignature. It is he who announces the order of business, states the\r\nquestion, and announces the vote. He also has the right to appoint the\r\nchairman of the committee of the whole. The Speaker takes part in\r\ndebate and may also vote.\r\n\r\n552. POWER OF THE SPEAKER OVER LEGISLATION.--In addition to performing\r\nthe customary duties of a presiding officer, the Speaker possesses\r\nimportant powers over legislation. The imperfect organization of the\r\nHouse, and its lack of effective leadership, as well as the vast\r\namount of business coming before it, have tended to centralize much of\r\nthe legislative power of the House in the hands of this officer.\r\n\r\nThe Speaker of the House has the power to determine to which committee\r\na bill shall be referred. Thus he may determine the fate of a measure\r\nby sending it to a committee which he knows to be hostile to the bill,\r\nor to a friendly committee, just as he likes.\r\n\r\nIt is the Speaker who decides when a member is entitled to the floor,\r\nand no motion or speech can be made except by a member who has been\r\nduly recognized by the chair. There are a number of unwritten rules in\r\nthis regard, but in the last analysis the Speaker may recognize only\r\npersons whom he desires to have speak. Thus Congressmen who are not of\r\nthe Speaker's party may be kept from making themselves heard upon\r\nimportant measures. When a bill is before the House, the chairman of\r\nthe committee in charge of the measure usually hands the Speaker a\r\nlist of Congressmen who are to be heard upon the floor. By recognizing\r\nonly those whose names appear on this list, the Speaker may confine\r\nthe discussion to members who are favored by himself and his party.\r\n\r\nThe Speaker has the power to decide points of order, and otherwise to\r\ndeal with such obstructions to legislative business as the\r\nfilibustering tactics of the minority party. Often this power is\r\nexercised in connection with the quorum. The quorum or number of\r\nmembers who must be present in order that business may be transacted,\r\nis fixed by the Constitution as a majority of each house. Formerly it\r\nwas the habit of minority members to remain silent at roll-call, so\r\nthat if several members of the majority party were absent, it might be\r\nthat no quorum would appear. In such a case legislative business would\r\nbe blocked. But in 1890 Speaker Reed adopted the practice, since\r\nbecome invariable, of counting as present members actually in the\r\nHouse, whether or not they respond to their names at roll-call. The\r\nSpeaker also checks filibustering by disregarding all motions and\r\nappeals which he thinks are made simply for the purpose of obstructing\r\nlegislative business.\r\n\r\n553. THE COMMITTEE ON RULES.--Of great importance in the House is the\r\ncommittee on rules. This committee has the power to decide upon the\r\norder for considering bills, and to determine the length of debates.\r\nIt also determines the time when the vote shall be taken. This it does\r\nby \"reporting a rule,\" that is to say, by presenting a report as to\r\nthe time and conditions under which the House shall consider a\r\nmeasure. This report takes precedence over all other business. Thus\r\nthe fate of a bill may be determined by the committee on rules.\r\n\r\nPrevious to 1910 this committee consisted of the Speaker, and two\r\nmajority and two minority members named by the Speaker. But in the\r\n61st Congress, there occurred what has been called the \"revolution of\r\n1910.\" This \"revolution\" opposed Speaker Cannon's policy of using for\r\npersonal and partisan purposes his power to appoint the other members\r\nof the committee on rules. As the result of a violent agitation the\r\nHouse finally placed marked restrictions upon the Speaker's control\r\nover the committee. The membership of the committee on rules was\r\nincreased, first to ten, and then to twelve. Of these twelve members\r\neight belong to the majority party and four are minority members. The\r\ncommittee is no longer chosen by the Speaker, but is selected by the\r\nHouse itself. The Speaker is even excluded from membership in the\r\ncommittee.\r\n\r\n554. THE CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE SYSTEM. [Footnote: For a discussion\r\nof the advantages and disadvantages of the committee system see\r\nChapter XXXVI.]--In both houses of Congress the assembly is divided\r\ninto a number of committees, each of which is charged with the\r\nconsideration of legislation dealing with particular subjects.\r\nPrevious to 1911 the Speaker appointed all House committees, but since\r\nthat date all committees have been chosen by the House as a body,\r\nthough in practice the decisions are made by the caucuses of the\r\nmajority and minority parties, held just before the organization of\r\nthe House. Similarly, the Senate chooses its own committees from lists\r\ndrawn up by the caucuses of the two political parties. In either\r\nhouse, the minority party has such representation upon committees as\r\nthe majority party chooses to allow. There are in the House more than\r\nfifty of these committees, while in the Senate the number is even\r\nlarger. In the House of Representatives the more important committees\r\nare those on rules, ways and means, appropriations, judiciary, banking\r\nand currency, interstate and foreign commerce, and rivers and harbors.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. THE MAKING OF A FEDERAL LAW [Footnote: A more detailed account of\r\nthe law-making process may be found in Reed, _Form and Functions of\r\nAmerican Government_, Chapter XXII.]\r\n\r\n555. HOW LEGISLATION IS INITIATED.--The course of congressional\r\nlegislation may be illustrated by following a bill through the House\r\nof Representatives.\r\n\r\nAny member of the House may introduce a bill by filing it with the\r\nclerk. The title of the bill is printed in the _Journal and Record_,\r\nthis constituting a first \"reading.\" The bill is then delivered to the\r\nSpeaker, who refers it to the proper committee. Once a bill has\r\nbeen passed to the committee its fate rests largely with that body.\r\nThe committee may confer with certain administrative officers, listen\r\nto individuals interested in the subject, summon and examine other\r\npersons, and then reach a decision upon the bill. The committee may\r\namend the bill as it pleases. If unfavorable to the measure, the\r\ncommittee may report it adversely, or too late for legislative action.\r\nIndeed, it may even fail to report it at all. Theoretically the House\r\nmay overrule the committee's decision on a bill, but so generally are\r\nthe committee's recommendations followed by the House that the adverse\r\naction of the committee virtually kills a bill.\r\n\r\n556. THE BILL IS REPORTED TO THE HOUSE.--Let us suppose that the\r\ncommittee reports the bill back to the House. The measure is then\r\nplaced upon a calendar and here awaits its turn, unless the committee\r\non rules sees fit to direct the immediate attention of the House to\r\nit. The second reading is an actual and full reading of the bill for\r\nthe purpose of allowing amendments to be offered. After the second\r\nreading, which may result in the adoption of amendments, the Speaker\r\nputs the motion, \"Shall the bill be engrossed and read a third time?\"\r\nDebate is then in order. If the vote which follows is in the\r\naffirmative, the bill is read a third time, but only by title. The\r\nquestion of passage is put by the Speaker immediately after the third\r\nreading.\r\n\r\n557. DEBATE UPON THE BILL.--Debate in the House of Representatives has\r\nlittle influence upon most bills, the fate of a measure being\r\npractically determined by the committee considering it. Most speeches\r\nare frankly intended for political purposes, and for circulation in\r\nthe Congressional Record, rather than as actual and positive\r\ninfluences upon the bill which is being discussed.\r\n\r\nDebate in the House is limited in several ways. No member may spend\r\nmore than an hour in debate upon any question, except the member in\r\ncharge of the bill. This member may have an additional hour at the\r\nclose. In the committee of the whole, speeches are limited to five\r\nminutes. No member may speak more than once on the same subject\r\nwithout special permission from the chair. The single exception to\r\nthis rule is the member who has introduced the bill. Before debate\r\nbegins, the chairman of the committee in charge of the bill arranges,\r\nin consultation with the Speaker, a list of members who are to be\r\nheard upon the bill. No other members are ordinarily recognized by the\r\nSpeaker in the ensuing debate.\r\n\r\nAfter a certain amount of discussion the member in charge of the bill\r\nwill generally move the previous question in order to cut short the\r\ndebate and bring the House to a direct vote upon the question.\r\n\r\n558. THE VOTE.--In the House voting may be by any one of three\r\nmethods. Voting may be by \"sound of voices.\" In this case the Speaker\r\ncalls in turn for the \"ayes\" and \"noes,\" and decides by the volume of\r\nthe sound whether the motion has been carried or lost. This is usually\r\nthe method first employed, but either of the other two methods may be\r\ndemanded before or after voting by sound of voices has been employed.\r\n\r\nVoting may be by tellers. When this is decided upon the members pass\r\nbetween tellers appointed by the Speaker--those in the affirmative\r\nfirst--and are counted. This method requires the demand of one fifth\r\nof a quorum.\r\n\r\nVoting may be by yeas and nays. In this event, the clerk calls the\r\nroll and each member, as his name is reached, answers \"aye\" or \"no,\"\r\nthe vote then being recorded. The Constitution provides that one fifth\r\nof the members present may demand the yeas and nays. Since it takes a\r\nlong time to call the roll of the House, demands for roll-calls are\r\nfrequently employed by minorities with the intent of obstructing\r\nlegislative business.\r\n\r\n559. THE BILL GOES TO THE SENATE.--A bill defeated in the House never\r\nreaches the Senate, of course.\r\n\r\nBut if it receives a majority vote in the House, it is engrossed and\r\nsent to the Senate. Here the bill goes through practically the same\r\nstages as in the House. [Footnote: In the Senate, however, debate is\r\nunlimited.]If the Senate rejects the bill, the measure is dead. If the\r\nSenate passes the bill without amendment, it is returned to the House,\r\nand enrolled on parchment for signature by the President. If the\r\nSenate amends the bill, the bill and the attached amendments are\r\nreturned to the House. If the House disagrees with the proposed\r\nchanges, it may either ask for an inter-house conference, or it may\r\nsimply send a notice of its disagreement to the Senate. In the latter\r\ncase, the Senate either reconsiders its amendments, or asks for a\r\nconference. In case of a conference, each house appoints an equal\r\nnumber of \"managers,\" who arrive at some sort of compromise, and\r\nembody this in a report. This report is acted upon by each house in\r\nseparate session.\r\n\r\n560. THE BILL GOES TO THE PRESIDENT.--Bills killed in Congress never\r\nreach the President, but a measure duly approved by both houses is\r\nthen sent to the chief executive for his approval. If he signs it, the\r\nbill becomes law. If he does not approve it, he may return it with his\r\nobjections to the house in which it originated. If this house votes\r\nfor the passage of the measure by a two-thirds majority, and if this\r\naction is concurred in by the other house, the measure becomes law\r\nover the veto of the President. If the President neither signs nor\r\nreturns the measure within ten days, it automatically becomes law.\r\nHowever, measures reaching the President during the last ten days of\r\nthe congressional session become law only if signed by him. His\r\nfailure to sign a bill reaching him under these circumstances\r\nconstitutes a \"pocket veto.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS ON THE TEXT\r\n\r\n1.

CONSTITUTIONAL BASIS OF THE FEDERAL JUDICIARY.--The Federal\r\nConstitution makes only slight reference to the structure of the\r\nFederal courts. It merely provides that the judicial power of the\r\nUnited States shall be vested in one Supreme Court, and in such\r\ninferior courts as Congress may from time to time ordain and\r\nestablish.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with this provision, Congress in 1789 passed the\r\nJudiciary Act, which still forms the basis of our Federal judicial\r\nsystem. The Judiciary Act provided for the organization of the Supreme\r\nCourt, and also created a system of circuit and district courts. It\r\nlikewise distributed Federal jurisdiction among the three grades of\r\ncourts, established the office of Attorney General, and provided for a\r\nFederal marshal in each judicial district. In order to relieve the\r\nSupreme Court of part of its appellate jurisdiction, Congress in 1891\r\ncreated nine circuit courts of appeals. In 1912, Congress abolished\r\nthe circuit courts which had been established by the Act of 1789.\r\n\r\nAt the present time, thus, there are three grades of Federal courts:\r\nthe Supreme Court, nine circuit courts of appeals, and eighty-one\r\ndistrict courts. In addition there are several special Federal courts.\r\n\r\n562. FEDERAL JUDICIAL AGENTS.--All Federal judges are appointed by the\r\nPresident, subject to confirmation by the Senate. They hold office for\r\nlife, or during good behavior. Since Federal judges can be removed\r\nfrom office only by impeachment, they are relatively independent, both\r\nof the appointing power and of the popular will.\r\n\r\nJudges receive salaries which may be increased, but which cannot be\r\ndiminished, during their term of office. Each of the eight associate\r\njustices of the Supreme Court receives an annual salary of $14,500,\r\nwhile the Chief Justice receives $14,900 a year. Circuit judges\r\nreceive a salary of $7000 a year. Each district court judge receives\r\n$6000 a year. Upon reaching the age of seventy years, any Federal\r\njudge who has held his commission for at least ten years, may resign\r\nand continue to draw full salary during the remainder of his life.\r\n\r\nSome additional judicial agents may be mentioned. In each Federal\r\njudicial district there is an United States marshal, who is charged\r\nwith the duty of enforcing the orders of the court. There is also in\r\neach district a Federal prosecutor, who has the title of United States\r\ndistrict attorney. It is this officer who institutes proceedings\r\nagainst persons violating Federal law. Both marshals and district\r\nattorneys work under the direction of the Attorney-General of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\n563. THE SUPREME COURT.--At the head of the Federal judicial system\r\nstands the Supreme Court. This tribunal holds its annual sessions at\r\nWashington, D. C., usually from October until May. By far the most\r\nimportant business coming before this court involves questions of\r\nconstitutional law. [Footnote: Jurisdiction over questions of\r\nconstitutionality is a form of appellate jurisdiction. In addition,\r\nthe Supreme Court has original jurisdiction in (1) cases affecting\r\ndiplomatic and consular officers, and (2) cases to which a State is a\r\nparty. In practice, however, the original jurisdiction of the Supreme\r\nCourt has been relatively unimportant. ] Cases involving questions of\r\nconstitutionality are always brought up to the Supreme Court, from\r\neither the lower Federal courts, or from the state courts. Cases of\r\nthis kind are brought before the Supreme Court either on appeal or by\r\nwrit of error.\r\n\r\nWhen a case is submitted to the Supreme Court, each justice makes an\r\nindependent study of it, and a conference is then held, in which the\r\nvarious sides of the question are discussed and a decision reached.\r\nThe Chief Justice then requests one of his colleagues to prepare the\r\n\"opinion of the court,\" containing the conclusions reached by the\r\nmajority. In important cases, the disagreeing minority prepares a\r\n\"dissenting opinion,\" setting forth their reasons for believing that\r\nthe case should have been decided otherwise. This dissenting opinion\r\ndoes not, however, affect the validity of the decision reached by the\r\nmajority of the justices.\r\n\r\n564. THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS.--The United States is divided into\r\nnine circuits, in each one of which a Circuit Court of Appeals\r\nexercises jurisdiction. The Circuit Court consists of three judges. As\r\na general proposition this court has appellate jurisdiction to review\r\nthe decisions of the district courts, but in some instances cases may\r\nbe taken from the district courts directly to the Supreme Court of the\r\nUnited States. In cases in which jurisdiction results from the fact\r\nthat the suit is one between an American citizen and an alien, or\r\nbetween citizens of different states in the Union, the decision of the\r\nCircuit Court of Appeals is generally final. The jurisdiction of this\r\ncourt is also final in all cases arising under the revenue, patent,\r\nand copyright laws of the United States.\r\n\r\n565. THE DISTRICT COURT.--The lowest of the regular Federal courts is\r\nthe District Court. One of these courts exists in each of the eighty-\r\none districts into which the country is divided. For each district\r\ncourt there is generally a separate district judge, who holds court at\r\none or more places within the district.\r\n\r\nThe matters which may be brought before a Federal District Court are\r\nvarious. Among other things, the jurisdiction of the court extends to\r\nall crimes and offenses cognizable under the authority of the United\r\nStates, cases arising under the internal revenue, postal and copyright\r\nlaws, proceedings in bankruptcy, all suits and proceedings arising\r\nunder any law regulating immigration, and also all suits and\r\nproceedings arising under any law to protect trade and commerce\r\nagainst monopoly.\r\n\r\n566. SPECIAL FEDERAL COURTS.--Besides the three sets of Federal\r\ncourts described above, Congress has from time to time created a\r\nnumber of special courts.\r\n\r\nThe Court of Claims was created in 1855. It consists of five justices,\r\nsitting at Washington, and exercising jurisdiction over cases\r\ninvolving claims against the United States.\r\n\r\nIn 1911 Congress created the Court of Customs Appeals, consisting of\r\nfive judges who may review the decisions of the Board of General\r\nAppraisers with respect to the classification and taxation of imports.\r\n\r\nCongress has also provided a system of territorial courts to handle\r\ncases arising in the territories and in the District of Columbia.\r\n\r\nCourts-martial for the trial of military and naval offenses have also\r\nbeen provided for by congressional statute.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. THE FEDERAL COURTS IN ACTION\r\n\r\n567. JURISDICTION OF THE FEDERAL COURTS.--The Federal courts exercise\r\nlimited, rather than general, jurisdiction. That is to say, they have\r\nauthority to try only such cases as are specifically placed within\r\ntheir jurisdiction by the Constitution, or by congressional statute.\r\nCases falling within the jurisdiction of the Federal courts may be\r\ngrouped under two heads: First, cases affecting certain parties or\r\npersons, and second, cases relative to certain matters.\r\n\r\nUnder the first head may be grouped cases affecting ambassadors, other\r\ndiplomatic representatives, and consuls. In the same group are\r\ncontroversies to which the United States is a party, controversies\r\nbetween two or more states, controversies between a state and the\r\ncitizens of another state, controversies between citizens of different\r\nstates, and controversies between a state, or the citizens thereof,\r\nand foreign states, citizens or subjects thereof.\r\n\r\nUnder the second head fall three types of cases: First, controversies\r\nbetween citizens of the same state claiming lands under grants of\r\ndifferent states. Second, cases of admiralty and maritime\r\njurisdiction, and third, cases in law or equity arising under the\r\nConstitution or laws of the United States, or treaties made under\r\ntheir authority.\r\n\r\n568. THE WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS. [Footnote: For the general arrangement\r\nof the material in Sections 568-570, I am indebted to Professor\r\nBeard's _American Government and Politics_, to which text\r\nacknowledgment is here made.]--In the exercise of their judicial\r\nfunctions the Federal courts have the power of issuing three great\r\nwrits affecting the rights of citizens.\r\n\r\nOf these the most famous is the writ of _habeas corpus_. This writ is\r\ndesigned to secure to any imprisoned person the right to have an\r\nimmediate preliminary hearing for the purpose of discovering the\r\nreason for his detention. Where the writ is properly issued, the\r\nprisoner is brought into court for a summary examination. If it is\r\nfound that he has been detained in violation of law, he is released;\r\nif not, he is remanded for trial.\r\n\r\nFederal judges may not issue writs of _habeas corpus_\r\nindiscriminately. A writ can be issued only in the following cases:\r\nFirst, when a prisoner is in jail under Federal custody or authority;\r\nsecond, when an individual is in jail for some act done or omitted in\r\npursuance of a law of the United States or the order, process, or\r\ndecree of some Federal court or judge; third, when an individual has\r\nbeen detained because of violation of the Constitution or some law or\r\ntreaty of the United States; and fourth, when a citizen of a foreign\r\ncountry claims to be imprisoned for some act committed with the\r\nsanction of his government.\r\n\r\n569. THE WRIT OF MANDAMUS.--The writ of mandamus may be used against\r\npublic officials, private persons, and corporations, for the purpose\r\nof forcing them to perform some duty required of them by law. Properly\r\nused, the writ of mandamus is called into action to compel executive\r\nofficers to perform some administrative duty. The court will not\r\nintervene, however, where the duty is purely discretionary and its\r\nperformance dependent either upon the pleasure of the official, or\r\nupon his interpretation of the law. Usually the applicant for a writ\r\nof mandamus must show that he has no other adequate legal remedy, and\r\nthat he has a clear legal right to have the action in question\r\nperformed by the officer.\r\n\r\n570. THE WRIT OR BILL OF INJUNCTION.--This writ may be of several\r\ndistinct types. It may take the form of a mandatory writ, ordering\r\nsome person or corporation to maintain a _status quo_ by performing\r\ncertain acts. For example, striking railway employees may be ordered\r\nto continue to perform their regular and customary duties while\r\nremaining in the service of their employer.\r\n\r\nThe injunction may take the form of a temporary restraining order\r\nforbidding a party to alter the existing condition of things in\r\nquestion until the merits of the case have been decided. This is often\r\nused in labor disputes.\r\n\r\nSometimes the writ is in the form of a permanent injunction ordering a\r\nparty not to perform some act, the results of which cannot be remedied\r\nby any proceeding in law. This, too, has often been used in labor\r\ndisputes.\r\n\r\n571. JUDICIAL INTERPRETATION OF THE STATUTES.--The crowning feature of\r\nthe American judiciary is its power to pass upon the constitutionality\r\nof state and Federal laws. The Constitution does not give to the\r\ncourts the power to declare state or Federal statutes invalid on the\r\nground that they conflict with the Federal Constitution, but in the\r\nfamous case of Marbury _v._ Madison in 1803, Chief Justice Marshall\r\ndemonstrated that under the Constitution the Supreme Court must\r\npossess the power of declaring statutes null and void when they\r\nconflict with the fundamental law of the land. In deciding against the\r\nvalidity of a law, the court does not officially annul it, but merely\r\nrefuses to enforce the statute in the particular case before the\r\ncourt. Thereupon, the executive officials who might be charged with\r\nthe administration of that particular law, neglect to enforce it.\r\n\r\n572. GENERAL POLICY OF THE FEDERAL COURTS.--The Federal courts have\r\nconsistently refused to decide abstract questions not presented in the\r\nform of a concrete case between parties to an actual suit. The Supreme\r\nCourt, for example, will take no notice of a statute until the\r\nquestion of its constitutionality arises in the form of a concrete\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nThe Federal courts have consistently refused to interfere in purely\r\npolitical questions, the decision of which rests with executive or\r\nlegislative authorities. For example, the court will not touch\r\nquestions of the existence of war or peace, or the admission of a new\r\nstate into the Union.\r\n\r\nIn reaching a decision, two forces are brought to bear upon the\r\ncourts. First, the character of previous decisions in similar or\r\nanalogous cases influences a decision. Second, important consideration\r\nis given the demands of justice or equity in the particular case in\r\nhand, regardless of precedent.

STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV\r\n\r\nCONSTITUTIONAL BASIS OF STATE GOVERNMENT [Footnote: For a fuller\r\ndiscussion of the constitutional basis of state government, see\r\nChapter XXII of Beard's _American Government and Politics_. ]\r\n\r\n\r\n573. CONSTITUTIONAL LIMITATIONS ON STATE GOVERNMENTS.--Under the\r\nArticles of Confederation the states exercised practically sovereign\r\npowers; in the interests of a strong National government the\r\nConstitution adopted in 1789 distinctly limited the scope of state\r\ngovernment. The Federal Constitution transferred many important powers\r\nfrom the states to the Federal government, and imposed certain\r\nspecific limitations upon state governments. The more important of\r\nthese limitations are as follows:\r\n\r\nNo state may, without the consent of Congress, lay or collect imposts\r\nand duties upon exports and imports. The single exception to this\r\nconstitutional prohibition is that a state may lay such imports or\r\nduties as are absolutely necessary for executing its inspection laws.\r\nNo state may lay a tonnage duty without the consent of Congress.\r\n\r\nNo state may levy a tax on the property, lawful agencies, or\r\ninstrumentalities of the Federal government. This is not a\r\nconstitutional limitation, but was deduced by Chief Justice Marshall\r\nfrom the nature of the Federal system. In recent years, however, this\r\ndoctrine has been modified to mean that no state may tax a federal\r\ninstrumentality if such a tax would _impair its efficiency in\r\nperforming the function which it was designed to serve._\r\n\r\nStates may legislate concerning local commercial matters, but no state\r\nmay interfere with interstate commerce. No state may pass any law\r\nimpairing the obligation of contracts. The states have practically no\r\ncontrol over the monetary system. They may not coin money, emit bills\r\nof credit, or make anything but gold and silver coin legal tender.\r\nStates may charter and regulate state banks, however, and may also\r\nauthorize a state bank to issue notes for circulation.\r\n\r\nNo state may make or enforce any law which abridges the privileges or\r\nimmunities of citizens of the United States. No state shall pass any\r\nbill of attainder, by which is meant a legislative act which inflicts\r\npunishment upon some person without ordinary judicial trial. Nor may\r\nany state pass an _ex post facto_ law, that is to say, a law which\r\nimposes punishment for an act which was not legally punishable at the\r\ntime when it was committed. Lastly, no state may deprive any citizen\r\nof life, liberty, or property without due process of law, nor deny to\r\nany person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the law.\r\n\r\n574. POWERS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS.--Federal law is the highest law of\r\nthe land, and no state constitution, state statute, or local law or\r\nordinance, may contravene it. But beyond this restriction, the\r\nauthority of the state is supreme. Just as state government must defer\r\nto Federal authority, so local government is subservient to state\r\nauthority. Just as the Federal Supreme Court may declare\r\nunconstitutional any executive or legislative act, either of the\r\nNational, state, or local authorities, so the Supreme Court of any\r\nstate may declare null and void the acts of state or local authorities\r\nwhich conflict with its constitution. Though they are limited by the\r\nFederal Constitution in matters which are preeminently national, the\r\nstates reserve to themselves a vast body of authority. Almost all of\r\nthe ordinary activities of life are controlled by state or local\r\ngovernments, rather than by the Federal government.\r\n\r\n575. CLASSIFICATION OF STATE CONSTITUTIONS: ACCORDING TO AGE.--Each\r\nof the forty-eight states in the Union has a written constitution. To\r\nbring out the fundamental similarities and differences among the\r\nvarious state constitutions, these documents may be classified in\r\ntwo ways, first as to age, and second, in the light of democratic\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nIf state constitutions are classified on the basis of age, it will be\r\nnoted that the constitutions of Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode\r\nIsland, and other New England states show signs of having been\r\nstrongly influenced by colonial precedents. Next come constitutions\r\nwhich in form and general content stand midway between the earlier New\r\nEngland constitutions and those of more recent years. The\r\nconstitutions of New York (1894), Pennsylvania (1873), Indiana (1851),\r\nWisconsin (1848), Kentucky (1891), Minnesota (1857), and Iowa (1857),\r\nare examples. Next come those constitutions of the southern states\r\nwhich have been revised within the last quarter of a century. Finally,\r\nwe may note that California, Oregon, Oklahoma and a few other western\r\nstates have recently drafted new constitutions in which there has been\r\na more or less radical departure from the precedents set in the older\r\ncommonwealths.\r\n\r\n576. CLASSIFICATION OF STATE CONSTITUTIONS: IN THE LIGHT OF DEMOCRATIC\r\nDEVELOPMENT.--Between 1776 and 1800 American state constitutions were\r\ngenerally brief and conservative. Between 1800 and 1860 the growing\r\ntendency toward democratic control resulted in the formation of state\r\nconstitutions which were more and more liberal. During this period\r\nfear of the masses was superseded by distrust of the executive and an\r\nunbounded faith in the people acting in their collective capacity. The\r\nsuffrage was extended, the governor and often state judges came to be\r\nelected by direct vote, and the power of the state legislature was\r\nenlarged.\r\n\r\nAfter 1860 there was a reverse movement. This was due partly to a\r\ngrowing faith in the executive, and partly to a reaction against the\r\nabuse of power by state legislatures. Particularly the more recent\r\nstate constitutions have limited the power of the state legislature,\r\nincreased the power of the executive, provided for the centralization\r\nof the state administration, and shortened the ballot. The present\r\ntendency among state constitutions is to continue in the direction of\r\nthe above-mentioned reforms.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. THE PARTS OF A STATE CONSTITUTION\r\n\r\n577. THE BILL OF RIGHTS.--A vital part of a state constitution is the\r\nbill of rights, roughly corresponding to the first ten amendments to\r\nthe Federal Constitution. Generally the bill of rights affirms the\r\nprinciple of republican government, maintains that all powers are\r\ninherent in the people, and declares that all free government is\r\nformed by the authority of the people. A typical bill of rights also\r\nprovides that the laws of the state shall not be suspended except by\r\nthe legislative assembly, and includes the traditional limitations on\r\nbehalf of private rights. These include the right of free speech; the\r\nright to jury trial; the free exercise of religious worship; the right\r\npeaceably to assemble and petition the government for redress of\r\ngrievances; the privilege of the writ of _habeas corpus_ except in\r\ncase of rebellion, invasion, or public danger; the prohibition of\r\nexcessive bail, and cruel and unusual punishments; and compensation\r\nfor private property when taken for public use.\r\n\r\n578. THE FRAMEWORK OF GOVERNMENT.--A second part of a typical state\r\nconstitution deals with the distribution of powers, the limitations\r\nupon state officials and other elements in the framework of\r\ngovernment. Especially in the more recent constitutions is the form of\r\nstate government outlined in considerable detail. In addition to\r\nproviding a system of checks and balances by separating the executive,\r\nlegislative, and judicial powers of state government, this part of the\r\nconstitution defines and limits the suffrage, provides for the\r\norganization of the state legislature, and prescribes the limitations\r\nunder which the legislature must operate. The election of the Governor\r\nand other important state officials is provided for, as is the\r\nrelation of rural and municipal government to the state government.\r\nThis part of the constitution likewise creates the state judicial\r\nsystem, though the regulation of details with regard to jurisdiction,\r\nprocedure, and appeals is generally left to the discretion of the\r\nstate legislature.\r\n\r\n579. STATE FINANCES.--A third division of a typical state constitution\r\nplaces a number of limitations upon the financial powers of the state\r\nlegislature. These provisions are often detailed and complicated and\r\nhence are difficult to summarize. Their general purpose, however, is\r\nto fix a debt limit beyond which the legislature cannot go, and to\r\ncompel that body to make adequate provision for the payment of\r\ninterest and principal in the case of debts which shall be incurred.\r\n\r\n580. CONTROL OF ECONOMIC INTERESTS.--The more recent state\r\nconstitutions provide in considerable detail for the regulation of\r\neconomic interests within the state. The activities of industrial\r\norganizations are often narrowly restricted. In many states the\r\nconstitution provides for a corporation commission with large powers\r\nin the regulation of rates and charges, as well as general supervision\r\nof corporate business. Many recent constitutions specify the\r\nconditions under which women and children may be employed in\r\nindustrial establishments.\r\n\r\n581. PROVISION FOR THE GENERAL WELFARE.--An increasingly important\r\npart of the state constitution deals with the general welfare. Such\r\nvital concerns as the public school system are dealt with. In a\r\ntypical western state, for example, the constitution requires the\r\nlegislature to provide free instruction in the common schools of the\r\nstate for all persons between the ages of five and twenty-five. The\r\nsame document sets aside certain revenues for educational purposes.\r\nThe safeguarding of the public health, and detailed provision for the\r\ncreation and maintenance of public institutions for the dependent,\r\ndefective, and delinquent classes, are other concerns of this part of\r\nthe state constitution.\r\n\r\n582. PROVISION FOR AMENDMENT.--In about two thirds of the states the\r\nconstitution provides for its own amendment by a constitutional\r\nconvention composed of delegates elected by the voters of the state.\r\nThe convention method is universally employed when a new constitution\r\nis desired. Sometimes the state constitution provides for the holding\r\nof such conventions at regular intervals, but generally the initiative\r\nis left to the legislature. When, by vote or by resolution, this body\r\ndeclares in favor of a convention, the proposition is placed before\r\nthe voters. If a majority of these favor the project, the legislature\r\narranges for the election of delegates, and fixes the time and place\r\nof the convention sessions. After the convention has completed its\r\nwork, it is customary for the new constitution to be submitted to the\r\npeople for approval.\r\n\r\nAnother common way of amending the state constitution, found in every\r\nstate except New Hampshire, is through legislative action subsequently\r\nratified by popular vote. By this method separate constitutional\r\namendments may be adopted, without necessitating a wholesale revision\r\nof the constitution. Such individual amendments are usually proposed\r\nby the legislature and are later submitted to popular vote. In some\r\nstates only a majority vote of the legislature is required for the\r\nproposal of amendments, but ordinarily a special majority of two\r\nthirds or three fourths of the members of each house is required. In a\r\nfew states, amendments cannot be considered until they have been\r\nproposed by two successive legislatures. After the amendment has been\r\nproposed for the second time, it must be ratified at the polls.\r\n\r\nWithin the last decade several states, particularly in the West, have\r\nadopted a more direct method of amending the constitution. This is\r\nthrough the Initiative and Referendum. [Footnote: The general question\r\nof the Initiative and Referendum is treated in Chapter XXXVII.] In\r\nOregon, for example, 8 per cent of the legal voters may petition for a\r\nproposed amendment to the constitution. The proposal is then submitted\r\nto the voters, and if it receives a majority of all votes cast, it\r\nbecomes part of the state constitution. Arizona, Arkansas, California,\r\nColorado, Michigan, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, North Dakota, and\r\nother states allow this type of constitutional amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS ON THE TEXT\r\n\r\n1.

What\r\nare the advantages and disadvantages of this development?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVI\r\n\r\nTHE STATE EXECUTIVE\r\n\r\n\r\nA. THE GOVERNOR\r\n\r\n583. THE ELECTION OF THE GOVERNOR.--In every state in the Union the\r\nGovernor is elected by popular vote. In most of the states this\r\nelection takes place, together with that of other state officials, on\r\nthe Tuesday following the first Monday in November. Usually a\r\ngubernatorial candidate is required to be at least thirty years of\r\nage. He must be a United States citizen, and also a resident of his\r\nstate of at least five years' standing.\r\n\r\nThe Governor's term varies from two years in Massachusetts to four\r\nyears in more than twenty states. In general, the term of office is\r\nincreasing. The average salary received by a state Governor is $5000 a\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n584. LIMITATIONS UPON THE GOVERNOR.--A number of factors operate to\r\nlimit the power of the state Governor.\r\n\r\nThe Federal Constitution limits his authority by declaring that\r\npersons charged with crime in, and escaped from, a neighboring state,\r\nmust be delivered up to the executive authorities of the state in\r\nwhich the crime is charged to have been committed.\r\n\r\nThe executive power of state government is not concentrated under the\r\nGovernor, but is shared by the Governor with a host of administrative\r\nofficials. Many of these officials are elected directly by the people,\r\nand cannot, therefore, be held accountable by the Governor.\r\nFurthermore, the actual execution of the state laws rests primarily\r\nwith municipal and other local officials, and over these officers the\r\nGovernor has little or no control. The express powers of the President\r\nof the United States have been rather liberally interpreted by the\r\ncourts, but the powers of the state Governor have generally been\r\nconstrued in a narrow and literal sense. In many states the power of\r\nthe Governor rarely or never extends beyond the express limits imposed\r\nby the state constitution.\r\n\r\n585. EXECUTIVE POWERS OF THE GOVERNOR.--The Governor is charged by the\r\nstate constitution to see that the laws are faithfully executed. This\r\nis similar to the chief duty of the President of the United States,\r\nbut whereas the President is aided by subordinate administrative\r\nofficials over whom he has complete control, the Governor must act\r\nthrough a large number of state and local officials over whom he has\r\nlittle effective control.\r\n\r\nOf some value, however, is the power of the Governor to exercise\r\ngeneral supervision over the various executive officers of the state.\r\nHe enjoys, in addition, the power to appoint many of the subordinate\r\nadministrative officials. Usually these appointments must be confirmed\r\nby the upper house of the state legislature. In most cases the\r\nGovernor cannot remove officials so appointed without the consent of\r\nthe senate or council.\r\n\r\nThe Governor is commander-in-chief of the armed forces of the state,\r\nand when the regular officers of the law are unable to cope with\r\ndomestic violence, he is empowered to call out the militia. In this\r\nconnection, the Governor has the power of suspending the writ of\r\n_habeas corpus_, though most states declare that this writ may not be\r\nsuspended except in times of rebellion and invasion. Two or three\r\nstates have recently provided that the writ of _habeas corpus_ may not\r\nbe suspended in any case whatsoever.\r\n\r\n586. LEGISLATIVE POWERS OF THE GOVERNOR.--In general the Governor\r\noccupies the same relation to the state legislature, as does the\r\nPresident toward Congress. Thus the Governor may send periodic\r\nmessages to the legislature, and may recommend such legislative\r\nmeasures as he believes desirable. The Governor often communicates\r\nwith the legislature concerning the financial condition and needs of\r\nthe state. The Governor may also call special sessions of the state\r\nlegislature, for the consideration of urgent matters. In case the two\r\nhouses of the legislature are unable to agree upon a time for\r\nadjournment, the Governor may adjourn the state legislature.\r\n\r\nIn one respect the Governor's power of veto exceeds that of the\r\nPresident, for in about two thirds of the states the Governor may veto\r\nindividual items in appropriation bills. This privilege is denied the\r\nPresident, who must accept or reject a measure as a whole. Like the\r\nPresident, the Governor influences legislation through his relations\r\nwith the leaders of his party in the legislature, as well as through\r\nhis power of the patronage.\r\n\r\n587. JUDICIAL POWERS OF THE GOVERNOR.--In almost every state the\r\nGovernor has considerable control over the issuance of pardons and\r\nreprieves, in the case of all offenses committed against the state. In\r\nsome states the power to issue pardons and reprieves is exercised with\r\nthe consent of the state legislature, in other states the Governor\r\nshares this power with a board of pardons; in a few states the\r\nGovernor may act alone.\r\n\r\n588. TENDENCY OF THE GOVERNOR'S POWER TO INCREASE.--The earlier state\r\nconstitutions tended to restrict the powers of the Governor, and to\r\nextend liberal grants of power to the state legislature. Of recent\r\nyears the abuse of legislative power has tended to encourage suspicion\r\nof the legislature and a growing confidence in the Governor. As a\r\nconsequence, the Governor's term is in many states increasing. In the\r\neffort to shorten the ballot and concentrate responsibility for the\r\nstate administration upon some one official, various states are\r\nincreasing the appointive power of the Governor. In a few states the\r\nGovernor now has authority to make special inquiries into the workings\r\nof the various executive departments, with a view to checking\r\ninefficient and irresponsible methods of work. In some states the\r\nGovernor's share in budget-making is increasing. In the majority of\r\nstates the general tendency toward a shorter ballot, the\r\nreorganization of the state administration, and other methods of\r\nreforming state government, will probably continue to enlarge the\r\npower and influence of the Governor.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. THE STATE ADMINISTRATION\r\n\r\n589. THE OLDER GROUP OF ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICERS.--Aside from the\r\nGovernor, the administrative officers of the state fall into two\r\ngroups: First, the older officers, who are relatively few, and who are\r\nalmost always elective; and second, the newer officers, boards, and\r\ncommissions, who are relatively numerous, and who may be either\r\nelective or appointive.\r\n\r\nThe first group comprises such officers as the Lieutenant Governor,\r\nthe Secretary of State, the State Treasurer, the Auditor or\r\nComptroller, and the Attorney-General. These older officers are\r\nusually elected at the general state election for a term varying from\r\nstate to state. These officers are not under the control of the\r\nGovernor, but fulfill duties prescribed by the constitution, and are\r\nresponsible only to the people and to the courts. They may be, and\r\noften are, of a different political party than the Governor, and since\r\nthey are not under the control of that official, they often work at\r\ncross-purposes with him. This lack of co÷rdination is in striking\r\ncontrast to the harmony of action existing between the President of\r\nthe United States and the heads of the Federal Executive Departments.\r\n\r\n590. THE NEWER GROUP OF ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICERS.--As state government\r\nhas increased in complexity, the older group of administrative\r\nofficers has been supplemented by the addition of a large number of\r\nnew officers.\r\n\r\nThese newer administrative officials are quite numerous, but their\r\ngeneral character may be indicated by dividing them into two classes:\r\n\r\nThe first class includes individual officers, such as, for example, a\r\nsuperintendent of prisons, a state architect, a state historian, a\r\ncommissioner of health, a food inspector, a geologist, a commissioner\r\nof corporations, a commissioner of banking, a superintendent of public\r\nworks, and a state surveyor.\r\n\r\nBesides individual officers, the newer group of administrative\r\nofficials includes a large number of boards and commissions which have\r\nbeen created by the state legislature and endowed with large powers\r\nfor the study and control of specific matters. The following boards\r\nand commissions are examples of this second class: A state civil\r\nservice commission, a tax commission, a board of charities and\r\ncorrection, a water supply commission, a tax equalization board, a\r\nquarantine commission, a voting machine commission, a board of\r\npharmacy, a highway commission, and a public service commission.\r\n\r\n591. DEFECTS OF STATE ADMINISTRATION. [Footnote: For a fuller\r\ndiscussion of this problem, see Chapter XXXVI.]--The enlargement of\r\nthe state administration by this creation of numerous individual\r\noffices, boards, and commissions indicates an attempt on the part of\r\nstate governments to grapple with the problems of democracy.\r\nNevertheless, this rapid growth of the state administration has had\r\nserious consequences. Once created, many of the newer officers have\r\nattempted to perpetuate themselves. State legislatures have been\r\nharassed by boards and commissions seeking unnecessary appropriations.\r\nPoliticians without expert training or ability are often placed on\r\nboards and commissions dealing with technical matters.\r\n\r\nResponsible and efficient state government is rendered difficult by\r\nthe inability of the Governor effectively to control the few elective\r\nofficials who constitute the older group of administrative officers;\r\nan even greater difficulty arises from the creation and expansion of\r\nthe newer group of officers. The excessive number of individual\r\nofficers, boards, and commissions makes for inefficient and\r\nirresponsible government. Some of these officials are elected by the\r\npeople, others are appointed by the Governor. Their terms vary so\r\nwidely that, as Professor Beard has pointed out, the appointing power\r\nnever has an opportunity to make a clean sweep and introduce more\r\nefficient administrative methods. There is little or no co÷rdination\r\nbetween the various administrative offices, and very little\r\ncentralization of responsibility.\r\n\r\n592. THE STATE OF CIVIL SERVICE.--The spoils system has long\r\nconstituted a defect, not only in the Federal government but in\r\nAmerican state government as well. [Footnote: This problem is further\r\ndiscussed in Chapter XXXIV.] And as in the case of the National\r\ngovernment, this evil has been attacked primarily through the merit\r\nsystem. New York state led the way in 1883 by passing a comprehensive\r\nCivil Service Act. This law provided for a commission authorized to\r\nco÷perate with the Governor in preparing rules, classifying the state\r\ncivil service, and conducting the examinations for the positions to be\r\nfilled. Since then, Massachusetts, Wisconsin, Colorado, New Jersey,\r\nCalifornia, Ohio, Illinois, and other states have adopted some type of\r\ncivil service system.\r\n\r\nState civil service laws are largely modelled after the national Civil\r\nService Act of 1883. In most of the legislating states laws of this\r\ntype provide for competitive examinations of a practical nature; they\r\nprohibit political and religious interrogatives; and they forbid the\r\nassessment of holders of civil service positions for political\r\npurposes. Appointment and promotion are upon the basis of merit,\r\nalthough as in the case of the Federal civil service, the standards\r\nfor judging the character and capacity of individual officeholders\r\nhave not yet been perfected.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS ON THE TEXT\r\n\r\n1.

STRUCTURE OF THE STATE LEGISLATURE.--The representative branch of\r\nstate government is known under different names in various states, but\r\nthe term \"state legislature\" is in more or less general use.\r\n\r\nThe state legislature is invariably a two-chambered body; the upper\r\nhouse is the smaller and is called the senate, while the lower and\r\nmore numerous branch is variously known as the house of\r\nrepresentatives, house of delegates, or assembly.\r\n\r\nUsually the state senate differs from the lower house in certain\r\nimportant particulars. The senatorial districts from which members of\r\nthe upper house are elected are always larger than are the districts\r\nfrom which members to the lower house are chosen. Senators are usually\r\nchosen for longer terms than are representatives. As in the case of\r\nthe National Senate, the senate (in most states) is made a continuous\r\nbody by the provision that its members shall begin their terms at\r\ncertain periodic intervals. In the lower house of the state\r\nlegislature, on the other hand, all of the members take their seats at\r\nthe same time.\r\n\r\n594. BASIS OF REPRESENTATION.--For the purpose of electing members of\r\nthe state legislature, practically all of the states are divided into\r\nnumerous senatorial and representative election districts. Some states\r\napply the rule that representatives in the state legislature shall be\r\napportioned among districts containing practically an equal number of\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\nOther states, however, provide exceptions to this rule. For example,\r\nAlabama, Florida, New York and other states provide that each county\r\nshall have at least one member in the house. Often the result of this\r\narrangement is that the smaller or more sparsely populated counties\r\nare over-represented in the state legislature, while the more populous\r\ncounties are under-represented.\r\n\r\nSeveral states, notably Connecticut and Vermont, arrange\r\nrepresentation in the state legislature so that with respect to\r\npopulation, cities are under-represented and rural districts are over-\r\nrepresented. [Footnote: For a discussion of the problem of minority\r\nrepresentation in state legislatures, see Chapter XXXV.]\r\n\r\n595. MEMBERSHIP.--The state constitution determines the qualifications\r\nof those who are entitled to vote for state legislators. [Footnote:\r\nFor an enumeration of these qualifications, see Chapter XXXIII,\r\nSection 415.] Generally, anyone qualified to vote for a state\r\nlegislator is also eligible to membership. However, holders of both\r\nFederal and state offices are excluded from sitting in the state\r\nlegislature.\r\n\r\nIn some states the term of a senator is the same as that of a\r\nrepresentative, but generally senators are elected for a longer term\r\nthan are members to the lower house. Representatives are generally\r\nchosen for two years, senators for four.\r\n\r\nIn all states, members of the legislature are paid, either a fixed\r\nannual salary or a _per diem_ allowance based upon the length of the\r\nlegislative session. In most states senators and representatives\r\nreceive equal compensation.\r\n\r\nAll state legislators are privileged from arrest or civil process\r\nduring the session. In addition they enjoy the usual privilege of free\r\nspeech in their official capacities.\r\n\r\n596. ORGANIZATION.--Formerly state legislatures met annually, but at\r\npresent the great majority convene only once in two years. In the\r\neffort to cut down the amount of superfluous legislation, a number of\r\nstate constitutions now restrict the legislative session to from forty\r\nto ninety days. The legislature may adjourn itself to meet later in\r\nspecial session, or the Governor may call special sessions. The\r\nGovernor may adjourn the legislature, if the two houses fail to agree\r\nupon a time for adjournment.\r\n\r\nIn internal organization, the state legislature resembles Congress.\r\nExcept that the lieutenant governor is often the presiding officer of\r\nthe senate, each house chooses all of its own officers. Each house\r\ndetermines its own rules of procedure and keeps a journal of its\r\nproceedings. In addition, each house exercises the right of deciding\r\nupon the qualifications of its members, and disciplines and punishes\r\nits members for misconduct. As in the national legislature, work is\r\nexpedited by the committee system. The party is a dominant force in\r\nthe state as well as in the national legislature.\r\n\r\n597. POWERS OF THE STATE LEGISLATURE--The law-making powers of the\r\nstate legislature extend to practically all subjects. The presumption\r\nis that this body has a right to legislate upon any subject, unless\r\nspecific prohibitions have been imposed upon it by either the Federal\r\nor the state constitution.\r\n\r\nThe Federal Constitution forbids any state legislature to emit bills\r\nof credit, coin money, or pass laws impairing the obligation of\r\ncontracts. Neither bills of attainder nor _ex post facto_ legislation\r\nmay be enacted by a state legislature. The Federal Constitution\r\nlikewise declares that state legislatures may neither abridge the\r\nprivileges and immunities of citizens of the United States, nor\r\ndeprive persons of life, liberty, or property without due process of\r\nlaw. No state may deny to any person within the state jurisdiction the\r\nequal protection of the laws.\r\n\r\nRestrictions imposed by the state constitution fall into several\r\ngroups. These include restrictions in favor of trial by jury,\r\nreligious freedom, and other privileges usually embodied in a bill of\r\nrights; provisions controlling the grant of special favors to\r\ncorporations; restrictions upon the financial powers of the state\r\nlegislature; provisions defining the framework of state government;\r\nand prohibitions upon the power of the legislature to pass special and\r\nlocal laws. [Footnote: A special or local law is one which applies to\r\nsome particular individual or corporation, or to some particular city,\r\ncounty, or other locality. Prohibitions upon special and local laws\r\nare necessary in order to prevent the legislature from extending\r\nspecial favors to particular individuals or localities. ]\r\n\r\n598. HOW A STATE LAW IS MADE.--Bills may originate in either house of\r\nthe state legislature, except that in most states money bills must\r\noriginate in the lower chamber.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate law-making in the state legislature, let us assume that\r\na bill is introduced in the lower house. This may be done by any one\r\nof several methods. Any member of the house may deposit a bill in a\r\nbox near the speaker's desk. Sometimes a bill is introduced by the\r\nreport of a committee, or even by a messenger from the senate. When\r\nthe bill has been introduced, it is given a first reading. With the\r\nconsent of the house, the speaker then refers the measure to the\r\nappropriate committee. The adverse report of the committee generally\r\nkills the bill; but if the bill is favorably reported, and this report\r\nis approved by the house, the bill is placed on the order of second\r\nreading and is debated section by section, unless by unanimous vote it\r\nis advanced to the third reading. If the bill passes the second\r\nreading, it is generally referred to the committee on revision. It is\r\nthen engrossed, reported back to the house for the third reading and\r\nthe final vote. Sometimes the yeas and nays of this final vote are\r\nentered upon the journal, so that responsibility may be fixed upon\r\neach member.\r\n\r\nThe bill then goes to the senate, where the procedure is very much\r\nlike that of the house, except that the committee of the whole\r\nsometimes takes the place of the order of the second reading as\r\nconducted in the house.\r\n\r\n599. THE BILL GOES TO THE GOVERNOR.--In every state except North\r\nCarolina, a bill which has passed both branches of the legislature\r\nmust then go to the Governor for approval. If this officer signs it,\r\nit becomes law. If he disapproves of it, he returns it with his\r\nobjections to the house in which it originated. In spite of this\r\nobjection by the Governor the legislature may enact the measure into\r\nlaw, if a sufficiently large majority in each house votes in favor of\r\nthe bill. This majority is usually two thirds of the members in each\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nGenerally the Governor has a ten-day period in which to consider\r\nbills. If a bill is not returned to the legislature with his\r\nobjections within this period, it automatically becomes law without\r\nhis signature, unless the adjournment of the legislature prevents its\r\nreturn to that body. In most states the Governor has the important\r\nprivilege of vetoing particular items in appropriation bills, while\r\nsanctioning the rest of the measure.\r\n\r\n600. DEFECTS IN STATE LEGISLATION. [Footnote: For a fuller discussion\r\nsee Chapter XXXVI.]--There is, among students of American government,\r\na general agreement that the legislative procedure of the various\r\nstates evidences a number of serious defects.\r\n\r\nOne of these defects is the absence of responsibility. Any member of\r\nthe state legislature may introduce as many bills as he likes, but he\r\nneed not assume responsibility for any of them.\r\n\r\nAnother serious evil is the lack of experience and technical skill on\r\nthe part of legislators. Legislators are frequently ignorant of the\r\nsubject matter with which they are called upon to deal. There is a\r\ntendency for legislators to ignore the effect of a new statute upon\r\nthe existing body of law. Nor is the constitutionality of the measure\r\ncontemplated always taken into account. Ill-advised and pernicious\r\nlegislation is the result.\r\n\r\nLog-rolling and lobbying constitute another defect of state\r\nlegislation. Log-rolling leads to the passage of numerous bills\r\nwithout their adequate scrutiny by individual members, and without\r\neither individual members or legislative committees assuming\r\nresponsibility for those measures. The pressure exerted upon state\r\nlegislatures for legislation favoring special interests is still\r\ngreat.\r\n\r\n601. THE REFORM OF LEGISLATIVE PROCEDURE.--A few states have attempted\r\nto overcome the lack of technical information on the part of\r\nlegislators by providing for expert bill drafters. In New York, for\r\nexample, the state legislature has been provided with a number of\r\ncompetent bill drafters whose duty it shall be, during the session of\r\nthe legislature, to draw bills, examine and revise proposed bills, and\r\nadvise as to the legal effect of any legislation. These bill drafters\r\nmay be set to work on the request of either house, or of a committee,\r\nmember, or officer thereof.\r\n\r\nA large number of states now have a legislative reference bureau which\r\nkeeps a careful record of the laws passed in the various states of the\r\nUnion. This bureau maintains a library, and issues bulletins for the\r\nguidance of legislators.\r\n\r\nIn 1909 Wisconsin created the office of reviser. This officer keeps a\r\nloose-leaf system of laws, and collects court decisions affecting\r\nstatutes. At the beginning of each session this officer also presents\r\nto the committees on revision of each house of the legislature, bills\r\nproviding for such consolidation and revisions as may be completed\r\nfrom time to time. The reviser supervises the preparation, printing,\r\nand binding of such compilations of particular portions of the\r\nstatutes as may be ordered by the head of any state department.\r\n\r\nThere is an increasing tendency to curb lobbying in state\r\nlegislatures. The laws of New York and Wisconsin may be taken as\r\ntypical. That of New York provides that every person retained or\r\nemployed for compensation as a counsel or agent by any person, firm,\r\ncorporation, or association, to promote or oppose, directly or\r\nindirectly, the passage of any bill or resolution, must be registered\r\nevery year in the office of the secretary of state, and must give the\r\nname of the person by whom he is retained. The Wisconsin law provides\r\nthat legislative agents or counsels may not attempt to influence\r\nmembers privately, but must confine themselves to arguing before\r\ncommittees and filing printed briefs with the members of the\r\nlegislature.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS ON THE TEXT\r\n\r\n1.

SOURCES OF LAW\r\n\r\n602. ENGLISH COMMON LAW.--One important source of our system of\r\njurisprudence is the English common law. This law is not found in the\r\nenactment of statutes, but consists of court decisions spread over\r\nseveral centuries. The common law has been defined as \"that rule of\r\ncivil conduct which originated in the common wisdom and experience of\r\nsociety,\" and which \"in time became an established custom, and has\r\nfinally received judicial sanction and affirmance in the decisions of\r\nthe courts of last resort.\" [Footnote: W. C. Robinson, quoted in\r\n_Government and Politics in The United States_, by W. B. Guitteau,\r\nHoughton Mifflin Co., Boston, 1920.] The common law began its\r\ndevelopment in early England, and with the settlement of America was\r\ntransplanted to this country. Though radically modified by American\r\nconstitutional and statutory enactments it still remains the basis of\r\nour legal system.\r\n\r\n603. EQUITY.--Common law tended to become so stereotyped and so\r\ninflexible that in some cases an application of the law worked an\r\ninjustice. Very early in English history this situation gave rise to a\r\nnew form of jurisprudence called equity. Equity is that legal system\r\nwhich supplements common and statute law by aiming to secure justice\r\nwhere a strict application of law would work an injustice. Equity\r\ndeveloped in England after the Norman Conquest, and, like the common\r\nlaw, was transferred to this country in colonial times. A distinct set\r\nof chancery or equity courts was created to administer equity in early\r\nAmerica, but at present equity is administered by the same judges that\r\npreside over the regular state law courts. Both equitable and legal\r\nrelief may be secured in one suit.\r\n\r\n604. STATUTES.--Another important source of law is the statutes\r\nenacted by the state legislature. Most state laws relate to the\r\nstructure and functions of government, but statutory enactment is also\r\nemployed to regulate a few branches of private law, including\r\nprincipally matters which affect the public at large as well as\r\nprivate individuals. Examples are laws relating to wills and\r\nsuccession to property, marriage and divorce, partnerships, and\r\ncorporations.\r\n\r\nThe scope of the statutes is widening, and during the last half\r\ncentury several fields of the common law have been covered by statute.\r\nCriminal law, criminal procedure, and civil procedure have been\r\ncodified in various states. Some states have attempted to codify the\r\nentire civil law, but experience has proved that this may easily\r\nrender the law too rigid.\r\n\r\n605. OTHER SOURCES OF LAW.--The state constitution, the Federal\r\nConstitution, and Federal laws and treaties with foreign countries are\r\nother sources of state law.\r\n\r\nIn summary, the various kinds of law which are enforceable in the\r\nstate courts may be considered as forming a pyramid, built upward by\r\nthe following steps: English common law, equity, state statutes, the\r\nstate constitution, Federal statutes, treaties with foreign nations,\r\nand the Federal Constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. STRUCTURE OF THE COURTS\r\n\r\n606. THE JUSTICE OF THE PEACE.--State courts are arranged in a\r\nprogressive series. At the bottom of this series is the justice of the\r\npeace, who exercises jurisdiction over petty offenses and over civil\r\ncases involving very small amounts. Generally there is a justice of\r\nthe peace in each township or other local district. In large cities\r\nthe civil and criminal jurisdiction of the justice of the peace is\r\nusually divided between two sets of courts: first, the municipal or\r\ncity courts, with a minor civil jurisdiction; and second, the police\r\nor magistrates' courts with jurisdiction over petty criminal offenses.\r\nThe police or magistrates' courts have the power to make preliminary\r\ninvestigations in case of felonies or serious misdemeanors.\r\n\r\n607. THE COUNTY COURTS.--Above the justices of the peace there are, in\r\nmost states, a number of county courts, exercising limited\r\njurisdiction. These courts, sometimes called courts of common pleas or\r\ndistrict courts, have jurisdiction over civil cases involving\r\nconsiderable sums, as well as jurisdiction over most criminal\r\noffenses. In addition these courts usually consider appeals from the\r\njudgments of justices of the peace.\r\n\r\n608. SUPERIOR OR CIRCUIT COURTS.--In many states there is a superior,\r\ncircuit, or district court immediately above the county courts, though\r\nin some states this tribunal takes the place of the county courts. The\r\nsuperior court has jurisdiction over civil cases involving unlimited\r\nsums, as well as unlimited original jurisdiction over criminal\r\nmatters. It may also try all cases over which the lower courts have no\r\njurisdiction.\r\n\r\n609. THE SUPREME COURT.--At the head of the state judicial system\r\nthere is a court of last resort, known in various states by different\r\nnames. It may be called the court of appeals, the court of errors and\r\nappeals, or simply the supreme court. Practically all of the cases\r\ncoming before this court are appealed from the lower courts.\r\nOrdinarily it deals with points of law rather than of fact.\r\n\r\n610. SPECIAL COURTS.--In addition to the regular state courts there\r\nare sometimes special tribunals for special purposes. Examples of such\r\ncourts are the probate or surrogates' courts for the settlement of the\r\nestates of deceased persons; children's courts for the treatment of\r\ncases involving children; courts of domestic relations; and courts of\r\nclaims for hearing claims against the state.\r\n\r\n611. STATE JUDGES.--In almost all of the states judges are chosen by\r\npopular vote, though in half a dozen states the choice of these\r\nofficials still lies with the legislature or with the Governor, or\r\nwith both acting jointly. Judges of the higher state courts are\r\ngenerally chosen for a long period of time, even for life, while the\r\njudges of the lower courts are chosen for relatively short periods.\r\nSalaries vary from practically nothing but fee money for some justices\r\nof the peace to an average of $7000 a year for justices of the supreme\r\ncourt. The qualifications imposed upon judges include a minimum age of\r\n25 to 35 years, and citizenship for a varying period of years. Another\r\ncommon requirement is residence within the state, or even residence\r\nwithin the judicial district. For judges of the higher courts it is\r\nthe custom to demand membership in the legal profession. Judges may be\r\nremoved by impeachment, and, in a few states, by use of the Recall.\r\n\r\n612. OTHER COURT OFFICIALS.--The district or prosecuting attorney is\r\nan important official. Generally he is chosen by the voters of the\r\ncounty, though in some instances he is elected from larger areas. The\r\ndistrict attorney represents the state in all criminal cases, and\r\nconducts the prosecution. This officer conducts a preliminary\r\ninvestigation into crimes and determines whether or not a prosecution\r\nshould be instituted. If the decision is in the affirmative, he\r\npresents the case to the grand jury. If the grand jury returns an\r\nindictment, that is, if it demands that the accused be held for trial,\r\nthe prosecuting attorney conducts the prosecution at the ensuing\r\ntrial.\r\n\r\nThe clerk, or recording officer, is generally appointed by the court,\r\nthough he may be elected by popular vote. The constable or sheriff is\r\nelected by popular vote. The clerk and the constable are charged with\r\nthe execution of all orders, judgments, and decrees of the court.\r\n\r\n\r\nC. POWERS AND PROCEDURE\r\n\r\n613. RELATION OF STATE TO FEDERAL COURTS.--The framework of American\r\ngovernment includes a dual system of courts, the Federal courts and\r\nthe state courts. The jurisdiction of the Federal courts is\r\nspecifically defined by the Federal Constitution, while the state\r\ncourts have a jurisdiction which is limited only by the prohibitions\r\nof the state and Federal Constitutions. The two systems of courts are\r\nindependent in the exercise of their respective powers, and have\r\nseparate jurisdictions. In some cases, however, the state courts\r\nhave a concurrent jurisdiction with the Federal courts, and a litigant\r\nhas a choice of tribunals before which to bring suit. In most suits\r\nthe decision of the state supreme court is final, but cases involving\r\nFederal law may be appealed for final decision to the Supreme Court of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\n614. POWER TO DECLARE STATE STATUTES UNCONSTITUTIONAL.--Just as the\r\nFederal courts are the final interpreters of all domestic law, so the\r\nstate courts have the power to pass upon the constitutionality of\r\nstatutes enacted either by the state legislature or by local law-\r\nmaking bodies. The state constitution is the fundamental law of the\r\nstate, and it is the duty of the state courts to see that all state\r\nand local legislative acts conform to this fundamental law.\r\n\r\n615. POWER OVER EXECUTIVE OFFICIALS.--Through their power to pass upon\r\nthe legality of executive acts, the state courts exercise some degree\r\nof control over executive officials. If a state governor were\r\nillegally to remove an official from office, for example, the courts\r\ncould reinstate the latter.\r\n\r\nThe state courts also have the power to issue writs of mandamus and\r\ninjunction. The former may be used, under certain circumstances, to\r\ncompel an executive officer to perform his duty; the latter writ may\r\nbe used to prevent either state officials or private individuals from\r\ncommitting illegal acts.\r\n\r\n616. CIVIL JURISDICTION.--The jurisdiction of the state courts is\r\neither civil or criminal.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of civil law is to protect the rights of the individual\r\nand to redress his wrongs. The individual rights which are the concern\r\nof civil law fall under three heads: First, the right of personal\r\nsecurity, including the right of protection against violence; second,\r\nthe right of personal liberty, including the rights set forth in the\r\nbill of rights of the state constitution; third, the rights of\r\nproperty, including the right to acquire and hold property, and the\r\nright to demand fulfilment of contracts made under state law.\r\n\r\n617. CIVIL PROCEDURE.--If an individual believes that his rights have\r\nbeen violated, he, as plaintiff, is entitled to file a complaint with\r\nthe proper court. The sheriff or constable then summons the defendant\r\nto appear in court, and the clerk of the court issues a summons or\r\nsubpoena to all witnesses which either party to the suit desires to\r\nhave testify. Generally either party may demand a trial by jury. Both\r\nplaintiff and defendant are ordinarily represented by counsel which\r\npresent the different sides of the case to the judge and jury. The\r\njudge decides what evidence may be properly presented to the jury.\r\nAfter the closing argument of the plaintiff's counsel, the judge\r\ninstructs the jury on the legal points involved in the case. The jury\r\nthen retire and attempt to reach an unanimous decision. If able so to\r\nagree, they return a verdict for either plaintiff or defendant, and\r\nafter the verdict has been accepted by the court, judgment is\r\nrendered. If the jurors have been unable to come to an unanimous\r\ndecision, the case is ordinarily tried with another jury, though in a\r\nfew states an unanimous verdict in civil cases is not required.\r\n\r\nIf the decision of the court is accepted as final, the judgment is\r\nenforced. On the other hand, the dissatisfied party may appeal the\r\ncase to the next higher court on the ground that the verdict was\r\ncontrary to the weight of evidence, or because of errors of law\r\ncommitted by the judge. Under certain circumstances the judge who\r\ntries the case may be induced to grant a new trial.\r\n\r\n618. CRIMINAL JURISDICTION.--The purpose of criminal law is to punish\r\nthose who have committed public wrongs, _i.e._ wrongs against the\r\nstate or community. Crimes are of two types: first, felonies,\r\nincluding such grave offences as murder, arson, burglary, and larceny;\r\nand second, misdemeanors, including such lesser offenses as bribery,\r\nknowingly receiving stolen goods, libel, assault and battery, and\r\ndisturbance of the peace. Usually felonies are punished either by\r\ndeath, or by a long prison sentence. Misdemeanors are ordinarily\r\npunished by fines or by imprisonment for a short term.\r\n\r\n619. CRIMINAL PROCEDURE.--A criminal proceeding usually begins with\r\nthe arrest of the accused person. Generally, though not always, arrest\r\nis in pursuance of a warrant. As soon after arrest as possible, the\r\naccused is brought before a magistrate for a preliminary examination.\r\nIf the examining magistrate finds that there is probable cause for\r\nholding him for trial, the accused is committed to jail to await\r\ntrial. Unless the charge is murder, however, the defendant may be\r\nreleased on bail.\r\n\r\nIf the charge is a serious one, indictment by the grand jury is the\r\nnext step. If this jury decides that the evidence is insufficient, the\r\ncharge is dismissed and the prisoner released. The grand jury meets in\r\nsecret, and hears only the charges against the accused. These are\r\ngenerally presented by the prosecuting attorney. After the defendant\r\nis indicted, the prisoner is brought into court and allowed to plead.\r\nIf he pleads guilty, the judge may forthwith impose sentence and there\r\nis no trial. If the plea is \"not guilty,\" a trial is arranged, a jury\r\nof twelve men impanelled, and the trial begins.\r\n\r\nThe case is opened by the prosecuting attorney, since it is the duty\r\nof the state to assume the defendant innocent until he is proved\r\nguilty. The prosecuting attorney presents his witnesses, each of which\r\nthe defendant's attorney may cross-examine, and in turn allows the\r\ndefendant's attorney to present the defense. The prisoner is not\r\nquestioned at any stage in the trial, unless he is willing to take the\r\nstand as a witness in his own behalf.\r\n\r\nAfter the prosecuting attorney and the defendant's counsel have\r\ncompleted their case, the judge sums up the evidence brought out by\r\neach side, and instructs the jury as to the law involved. The jury\r\nthen retire and attempt to reach a verdict. Generally such a verdict\r\nmust be unanimous, and if this cannot be secured, the jury is\r\ndismissed and the case is held for re-trial. If the verdict is \"not\r\nguilty,\" the prisoner is discharged; if he is found guilty, sentence\r\nis imposed by the court, either immediately or at some future\r\ndate.

DEVELOPMENT OF THE AMERICAN MUNICIPALITY [Footnote: For an extended\r\naccount of American municipal development, see Fairlie's _Municipal\r\nAdministration_. An excellent summary of Fairlie is found in\r\nGuitteau's _Government and Politics in the United States_, Houghton\r\nMifflin Co., Boston, 1920.]\r\n\r\n620. RAPID GROWTH OF AMERICAN CITIES.--A striking feature of American\r\nlife is the rapidity with which our cities have grown. At the time of\r\nWashington's first inauguration, the United States were so\r\npredominantly rural that only about one thirtieth of our population\r\nwas found in the cities. With the progress of the Industrial\r\nRevolution came an unprecedented development of transportation and the\r\nfactory system. More and more people made their homes in the cities,\r\nuntil in 1890 approximately a third of the people of the United States\r\nwere living in cities. According to the census of 1920 more than half\r\nof our population is concentrated in towns and cities.\r\n\r\n621. THE AMERICAN CITY BEFORE THE REVOLUTION.--New York, now the\r\nlargest American city, is also the oldest, having received its charter\r\nin 1686. Between that date and the outbreak of the Revolution,\r\nnineteen other municipalities received charters. The colonial cities\r\nmodelled their organization after the English borough. Practically all\r\nauthority was vested in a council, consisting of a mayor, recorder,\r\naldermen, and councilmen, acting as a single body. The mayor was\r\neither appointed by the Governor, or elected by the council. The chief\r\nduty of the mayor was to preside over the council and execute its\r\nordinances.\r\n\r\n622. THE AMERICAN CITY, 1775-1825.--Several important changes in the\r\ncharacter of the American city took place in the half century which\r\nfollowed the Declaration of Independence.\r\n\r\nThe power to grant charters to cities was transferred from the\r\nGovernor to the state legislature. This was the natural outcome of an\r\nincreasing suspicion of the executive authority, and a corresponding\r\nincrease of faith in the state legislature. Before the end of this\r\nperiod the city came definitely under the control of the state\r\nlegislature. In the absence of constitutional restrictions, the\r\nlegislature has continued to exercise an almost dictatorial control\r\nover the cities within its borders.\r\n\r\nAlso typical of this period was the subordination of city affairs to\r\nstate and national politics.\r\n\r\n623. THE AMERICAN CITY, 1825-1850.--During this period a number of new\r\ncities sprang into prominence. Immigration was increasing, and the\r\nindustrialization of the country was crowding the population into\r\nlarger and larger units.\r\n\r\nNew York, Boston, St. Louis, and other cities adopted the two-\r\nchambered-council plan.\r\n\r\nThe passion for democratic control swept away the property\r\nqualifications prescribed by some of the early city charters, and\r\npractically attained universal manhood suffrage. The demand for\r\npopular control likewise led to the present practice of choosing the\r\nmayor by popular vote, the older methods of State appointment or\r\ncouncil election being discarded.\r\n\r\n624. THE AMERICAN CITY, 1850-1875.--Many pressing municipal problems\r\nappeared in this period. The functions of the American city became\r\nmore numerous and more complex. Police and fire systems were\r\ninstalled; waterworks, sewer systems, and city parks were provided;\r\neducation and charitable relief were developed.\r\n\r\nUnder the stress of administering these additional functions, cities\r\napplied more and more frequently to the state legislature for special\r\nlegislation granting them additional powers. State legislatures tended\r\nto pass such special acts freely, with the result that corrupt and\r\npernicious legislation became common in many states. Special interests\r\nengaged in lobbying, bribery, and log-rolling to secure special favors\r\nfrom legislatures. Public service corporations often secured valuable\r\nfranchises on terms that did not adequately protect the public\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n625. MUNICIPAL REFORM.--The period since 1875 and especially since\r\n1900 has been marked by a strong tendency to reform municipal\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nThe abuse of power by the city council in many instances forfeited the\r\nrespect with which the public had formerly regarded that body. The\r\npower to appoint various city officials was transferred from the\r\ncouncil to the voters, and many of the functions formerly exercised by\r\nthe council were entrusted to newly created municipal boards.\r\n\r\nIn about half the states constitutional provisions now forbid the\r\nlegislature to pass special acts concerning municipalities. In other\r\nstates the constitution enumerates a large number of subjects with\r\nregard to which the legislature cannot enact special legislation. In\r\nsome states the cities of the state are classified into two or more\r\ngroups, according to population; the legislature is compelled to\r\ndesignate the group or groups to which statutes are to apply. In about\r\na dozen states certain types of cities are allowed to frame and amend\r\ntheir own charters, provided that such acts are not inconsistent with\r\nthe constitution and statutes of the state.\r\n\r\nMunicipal civil service reform is of increasing importance, more than\r\n200 American cities having sanctioned it in some form. As applied to\r\nmunicipal affairs the merit system includes a municipal commission,\r\nappointed by the mayor; a system of competitive examinations designed\r\nto test character and capacity; a plan for requiring the appointing\r\nofficer in each department of city government to select his\r\nsubordinates from an eligible list; a method of removing officials;\r\nand sometimes a system of pensioning employees who have grown old in\r\nthe service.\r\n\r\nThe movement for popular control has been closely associated with\r\nmunicipal development. The tendency to shorten the ballot, the holding\r\nof municipal elections at a different time than state and national\r\nelections, and the concentration of administrative officers under a\r\nresponsible appointing head, are steps in this direction. In many\r\nstates the Direct Primary has been intimately associated with\r\nmunicipal development. The Initiative, Referendum, and Recall have\r\nbeen adopted in a large number of cities, especially where the mayor-\r\ncouncil plan has been abandoned for the commission form of government.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. MUNICIPAL ORGANIZATION\r\n\r\n626. THE THREE TYPES OF CITY GOVERNMENT.--The three types of city\r\ngovernment in the United States are the mayor-council plan, the\r\ncommission plan, and the city manager plan. [Footnote: For a\r\ndescription of the commission and city manager plans of city\r\ngovernment, see Chapter XXXVI.] The commission plan is a new form of\r\ncity government which has been designed to overcome the defects of the\r\nold mayor-council plan, while the city manager plan is a modification\r\nof the commission plan. Of recent years both the commission plan and\r\nthe city manager plan have spread rapidly, but it is still true that\r\nfew American cities of any appreciable size have adopted either of\r\nthese two plans. The old mayor-council plan prevails in most American\r\ncities, and for this reason the remainder of this chapter will be\r\ndevoted to a description of this form of government.\r\n\r\n627. THE CITY COUNCIL: ORGANIZATION.--Usually the city council is a\r\nsingle-chambered body, though some of the larger cities have from time\r\nto time experimented with a double-chambered council. In some cities\r\ncouncilmen are chosen on a general ticket, but in most cases the\r\ncouncil consists of one member from each ward or district into which\r\nthe city is divided. Councilmen must be voters in the city in which\r\nthey serve, and by custom they are generally required to be residents\r\nof the ward from which they are chosen. The terms of councilmen vary\r\nfrom one to four years, two years being the average term. In the\r\nsmaller cities councilmen are usually unpaid, but in the larger\r\nmunicipalities they receive a stated salary.\r\n\r\n628. THE CITY COUNCIL: POWERS.--The typical American city is\r\nsubservient to the state legislature, the powers of city government\r\nbeing enumerated in a charter received from the legislature. These\r\nenumerated powers have been rather narrowly interpreted by the courts.\r\n\r\nThe council enjoys a measure of police power, which it may invoke to\r\nprotect the health and to further the well-being of the city's\r\ninhabitants. The exercise of this police power, however, must not\r\nconflict with state law.\r\n\r\nThe council has the power to levy taxes to defray expenses incurred in\r\nperforming municipal functions. State constitutions and legislatures\r\nlimit this power rather narrowly, however. Subject to a similar\r\nlimitation is the council's power to raise money through the issue of\r\nbonds.\r\n\r\nCity councils may act as the agents of the state government in matters\r\naffecting education and charitable relief.\r\n\r\n629. THE CITY COUNCIL: PROCEDURE.--The city council meets\r\nperiodically, generally weekly or bi-weekly. It determines its own\r\nrules of procedure and keeps a journal. The committee system is used\r\nfor the dispatch of business. Ordinances may be proposed by any member\r\nof the council. After being introduced, ordinances are read by title\r\nand are referred to the proper committee. A second and third reading\r\nat subsequent meetings are required. If the ordinance is approved by a\r\nmajority of the council, it is signed by the presiding officer, and\r\nsent to the mayor. In many cities the mayor may veto any ordinance\r\npassed by the council. In case of a veto the measure becomes law only\r\nif passed by a two thirds--in some cities three fourths or four\r\nfifths--vote of the council. In those cities where the mayor has no\r\nveto power, the ordinance goes into effect immediately upon being\r\npassed by the council.\r\n\r\n630. THE MAYOR.--In all cities where the mayor-council plan of\r\ngovernment prevails, the chief executive officer is the mayor or chief\r\nmagistrate. This officer is usually elected by popular vote, for a\r\nterm varying from one to four years. Usually the term is two years,\r\nthough in New England a one-year term is more common. The mayor is\r\npaid a salary which ranges from a few hundred dollars in the smaller\r\ncities to several thousands of dollars in a number of the larger\r\nmunicipalities.\r\n\r\n631. THE MAYOR AND THE COUNCIL.--It is the duty of the mayor to\r\ncommunicate at least once a year to the city council a general\r\nstatement of the administration and financial condition of the\r\ncity. The mayor may also recommend to the city council, in his annual\r\nmessage or otherwise, the passage of ordinances which he considers\r\nneedful. In smaller cities, and in a few of the larger municipalities,\r\nthe mayor presides over the council and has a casting vote in case of\r\na tie, but in most of the larger cities he is not a member of the\r\ncouncil. In most cities he has the veto power. In many of the more\r\nrecent city charters, the mayor is given the power to veto separate\r\nitems in an appropriation bill, while approving the remainder of the\r\nmeasure, just as some Governors may veto separate items in\r\nappropriations bills enacted by the state legislature.\r\n\r\n632. ADMINISTRATIVE DUTIES OF THE MAYOR.--The mayor stands at the head\r\nof the city administration, but the extent of his control varies from\r\ncity to city. In the last half century the decline in popular favor of\r\nthe city council has been accompanied by a growing tendency to enlarge\r\nthe administrative powers of the mayor. In many of the smaller cities\r\nthe mayor is still little more than a presiding officer of the\r\ncouncil. In such cities subordinate executive officials are usually\r\nchosen by popular vote or are appointed by the council. In other\r\ncities the mayor may appoint the chief administrative officials,\r\nsubject to the consent of the council. In still other cities,\r\nincluding many of the larger municipalities, the mayor may both\r\nappoint and remove the heads of the executive departments, without\r\ninterference on the part of the council.\r\n\r\n633. OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICIALS.--Such highly complex and\r\nimportant matters as health, education, parks, charities, police, fire\r\nprotection, and public works are the concern of the numerous\r\nadministrative officials of the city. Administrative work is carried\r\non by two methods, first, the board system, in which such concerns as\r\nschools, public health, and police are managed by boards composed of\r\nmembers of the city council; and second, single commissioners, who are\r\nmore or less under the control of the mayor. The board system has\r\nproved less efficient than the single commissioner plan, and\r\naccordingly there is a tendency to abandon the former for the latter\r\nplan.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS ON THE TEXT\r\n\r\n1.

TYPES OF RURAL LOCAL GOVERNMENT.--Rural local governments in the\r\nUnited States vary widely as between different sections of the\r\ncountry, but in general they are divisible into three types. These\r\nare:\r\n\r\n(a) the town type, so common in New England;\r\n\r\n(b) the county type, found chiefly in the South, the Southwest, and\r\nthe Far West; and\r\n\r\n(c) the mixed type of the Middle, Central, and Northwestern states.\r\nThese three general types will be discussed in the order named.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. THE TOWN TYPE\r\n\r\n635. NATURE OF THE TOWN.--The basis of rural local government in New\r\nEngland is the town. [Footnote: The county exists in New England as an\r\naggregation of towns. The county has acquired other functions, but it\r\nis still primarily a judicial district.] In general the New England\r\ntown is an irregularly shaped area, varying in size from twenty to\r\nforty-five square miles. The area comprising the typical town is\r\nprimarily rural, and generally contains one or more villages. Although\r\nthe town is primarily a rural unit, the villages within its bounds may\r\nbe so populous as to be classed as cities. Yet these populous\r\ncommunities may, as in the case of Brookline, Massachusetts, retain\r\nthe town government. Other New England cities, such as New Haven and\r\nHartford, Connecticut, have continued the town organization separate\r\nfrom the city government.\r\n\r\n636. ORIGIN OF THE TOWN.--Some authorities believe that the town type\r\nof rural local government can be traced back through English history\r\nto the early Teutonic tribes. Whether or not this is true, it is\r\ncertain that the principle is an ancient one, and that when New\r\nEngland was first settled, the colonists grouped together in small\r\ncompact communities, or towns, instead of scattering over larger\r\nareas.\r\n\r\n637. WHY TOWN GOVERNMENT DEVELOPED IN NEW ENGLAND.--Several factors\r\nare responsible for the tendency of the settlers of early New England\r\nto draw together in towns. From the economic point of view, the barren\r\nnature of the soil rendered extensive farms impracticable, while, on\r\nthe other hand, the opportunities for fishing and commerce encouraged\r\nsmall, compact settlements along the coast. The hostility of many of\r\nthe New England Indians also discouraged sparse settlements and\r\nobliged the people to settle in close formation. Lastly, many of the\r\nNew England colonists came to the New World as groups or communities\r\nwhich in their European homes had pivoted about a common church; in\r\nNew England these people naturally preferred to live very near one\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n638. TOWN GOVERNMENT.--The government of the New England town is\r\nvested in a town meeting, which consists of an annual session of the\r\nvoters of the town. At this meeting the voters enact laws governing\r\nsuch local matters as town finance, schools, police, and highways. A\r\nsecond important function of the town meeting is to choose the town\r\nofficers, including the selectmen, [Footnote: In Rhode Island the\r\nselectmen are known as the council.] the town clerk, treasurer,\r\nconstable, and others. The chief executive officers are the selectmen,\r\nvarying in number from three to nine, and generally chosen for the\r\nterm of one year. The selectmen have general charge of town affairs,\r\nand act under authority conferred by statute or by the town meeting.\r\nThe town clerk keeps the records, the treasurer has charge of the\r\nfunds of the town and sometimes audits accounts, while the constable\r\nkeeps the peace of the town, serves writs, and collects local taxes.\r\nIn addition there are a number of minor officials, such as tax\r\nassessors, pound-keepers, guardians of the poor, highway officials,\r\nand library trustees.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. THE COUNTY TYPE\r\n\r\n639. WHY COUNTY GOVERNMENT DEVELOPED IN THE SOUTH.--The system of\r\ncounty government became as firmly intrenched in the Southern colonies\r\nas did the concept of the town in early New England. Four factors\r\noperated to discourage town government, and to encourage county\r\ngovernment, in the South. First, the Southern colonists did not come\r\nin small family groups, as did the New Englanders, but rather as\r\nindividuals and from different classes of society. Second, the Indians\r\nof the South were either weak or peaceful, so that fear of Indian\r\nattack did not oblige the colonists to congregate in small, compact\r\ncommunities. Third, the climate and soil of the South encouraged a\r\nplantation system which resulted in a sparse rather than in a compact\r\npopulation. Fourth, the aristocratic type of society developing from\r\nthe plantation and slave system prevented the rise of the democratic\r\ntown meeting.\r\n\r\n640. GOVERNMENT OF THE SOUTHERN COUNTY.--Though county government is\r\nalso found in the Southwest and Far West, it is seen in its purest\r\nform in the South. Here the county was originally a judicial district,\r\nor sometimes also a financial district to facilitate the collection of\r\ntaxes. The functions of the county have gradually increased until such\r\nlocal affairs as schools, jails, poorhouses, and the maintenance of\r\nroads and bridges are concerns of the Southern county. The chief\r\nadministrative authority in the county is either the county court, or\r\na small board of commissioners. In either case the administrative\r\nauthority is chosen by popular vote. In addition there are a number of\r\nminor officers such as the treasurer, tax assessor, and recorder, all\r\nof them chosen by popular vote for terms varying from one to four\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n641. GOVERNMENT OF THE FAR WESTERN COUNTY.--In the Far West, likewise,\r\nthe most important unit of rural local government is the county. The\r\ncounty is governed by a board, usually consisting of three\r\ncommissioners. In general the officers of the Far Western county\r\nresemble those in the central states. (See Section 644.)\r\n\r\n\r\nC. THE MIXED TYPE [Footnote: Sometimes called the township-county\r\nsystem.]\r\n\r\n642. ORIGIN OF THE MIXED TYPE.--The mixed type of rural local\r\ngovernment is a hybrid, the result of the incomplete fusion of the\r\ntown type with the county type. The northern parts of the Central\r\nstates were settled largely by immigrants from New England, while the\r\nsouthern portions of the Middle West were settled by pioneers from\r\nPennsylvania and the states south of the Ohio River. The New England\r\nimmigrants were used to town government, and endeavored to perpetuate\r\nit in their new home; the settlers from the South preferred the county\r\nform of government, and sought its adoption in their new homes. The\r\nresult was a compromise, some functions of rural local government\r\nbeing assigned to the county and some to the township.\r\n\r\n643. THE TWO SUB-TYPES.--In the fusion of the town and county types of\r\ngovernment the county system tended to predominate over the town or\r\ntownship form of government when settlers from the South were in the\r\nmajority. In the northern section of the country, on the other hand,\r\nthe compromise form tended to include a majority of the features of\r\nthe town type. The result was the formulation of two sub-types.\r\n\r\nThe first of these may be called the Pennsylvania sub-type, so named\r\nbecause it originated in Pennsylvania, and then spread, with\r\nmodifications, to Ohio, Indiana, Kansas, Missouri, and other states.\r\nIn these states the town or township authority is subordinated to the\r\ncounty government. There is no town meeting.\r\n\r\nThe New York sub-type exists in typical form in New York, but is also\r\nfound in New Jersey, Michigan, Illinois, Wisconsin, Minnesota, the\r\nDakotas, and other states. The town meeting is found in these states,\r\nand in five of them the townships are represented on the county board.\r\n\r\n644. THE NEW YORK SUB-TYPE.--In states possessing the New York sub-\r\ntype of rural local government, the town meeting is still important.\r\nThis meeting is similar to the New England town meeting, though it\r\nexercises less authority. All the legal voters of the township are\r\nqualified to take part in this meeting, which is held annually and on\r\nspecial occasions. At this meeting are chosen township officers for\r\nthe following year. The most important of these are the supervisor,\r\nclerk, treasurer, assessor, and a varying number of constables and\r\njustices of the peace. In addition to electing these and other\r\nofficers, the town meeting enacts legislation with regard to such\r\nlocal matters as bridges, roads, and schools.\r\n\r\nIn some of the Central states general executive authority over\r\ntownship affairs is vested in a township board, while in other states\r\nadministrative authority is divided between a township board of from\r\nthree to eleven members, and a supervisor or trustee. Besides these\r\nofficials, there are a number of minor officers, including a clerk, a\r\ntreasurer, an assessor, overseers of the poor, constables, and\r\njustices of the peace.\r\n\r\nThe county board continues to exist under the New York plan, but it is\r\nfar less important than under the Pennsylvania sub-type. The functions\r\nof the county board are similar in these two sub-types.\r\n\r\n645. THE PENNSYLVANIA SUB-TYPE.--In those states in which the\r\nPennsylvania sub-type of rural local government prevails, general\r\ncontrol of government is vested in a county board. This board is\r\ncomposed of three commissioners, who are elected by the voters of the\r\ncounty. In all of the Central states the county board possesses\r\nnumerous powers, but the powers of the board are greater under the\r\nPennsylvania than under the New York sub-type. Under the former plan\r\nthe county board exercised four groups of powers: First, the levying\r\nof taxes and the appropriation of local funds; second, the maintenance\r\nof roads; third, poor-relief; and fourth, the supervision of local\r\nelections.\r\n\r\nBesides the members of the county board there are a number of other\r\ncounty officials. The chief executive officer of the county court is\r\nthe sheriff. The prosecuting attorney is an elective official, whose\r\nduty it is to conduct criminal prosecutions, and to act as the legal\r\nagent of the county. The treasurer has charge of county funds, and\r\nsometimes supervises the collection of taxes. He is elected by the\r\npeople, generally for a two-year term. The clerk or auditor is an\r\nimportant county officer, as is the surveyor, the county\r\nsuperintendent of schools, and the recorder or register of deeds.\r\n\r\n646. HOME RULE FOR COUNTIES.--Generally, county authorities are\r\nnarrowly limited by the state constitution and state statutes. This\r\nhas always resulted in numerous appeals to the legislature for special\r\nlegislation, and has lately given rise to a demand for home rule for\r\ncounties. In the effort to reduce the pressure for special laws in the\r\nlegislature, the Michigan constitution of 1908 provided for a measure\r\nof home rule for counties. The legislature is authorized to confer\r\nlegislative powers on the county boards, which may pass laws and\r\nordinances relative to purely local affairs, provided such enactments\r\ndo not conflict with state law, and provided, further, that such\r\nenactments do not interfere with the local affairs of any township,\r\nincorporated city, or village within the limits of the county. Such\r\nlaws may be vetoed by the Governor, but may be passed over his veto by\r\na two-thirds vote of the county board. Another step toward home rule\r\nwas taken when in 1911 California by constitutional amendment\r\nempowered counties to frame their own charters, and, on securing\r\npopular approval, to put the same into effect. However, the charter\r\nthus framed and approved must first be sanctioned by the state\r\nlegislature.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS ON THE TEXT\r\n\r\n1.

In every case, after the choice of the\r\nPresident, the person having the greatest number of votes of the\r\nelectors shall be the Vice-President. But if there should remain two\r\nor more who have equal votes, the Senate shall choose from them by\r\nballot the Vice-President.]\r\n\r\n3.

The judicial power of the United States shall be vested\r\nin one Supreme Court, and in such inferior courts as Congress may from\r\ntime to time ordain and establish. The judges, both of the Supreme and\r\ninferior courts, shall hold their offices during good behavior, and\r\nshall, at stated times, receive for their services, a compensation,\r\nwhich shall not be diminished during their continuance in office.\r\n\r\nSECT. II. I. The judicial power shall extend to all cases, in law and\r\nequity, arising under this Constitution, the laws of the United\r\nStates, and treaties made or which shall be made, under their\r\nauthority;--to all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers\r\nand consuls;--to all cases of admiralty jurisdiction;--to\r\ncontroversies to which the United States shall be a party;--to\r\ncontroversies between two or more States;--between a State and\r\ncitizens of another State;--between citizens of different States;--\r\nbetween citizens of the same State claiming lands under grants of\r\ndifferent States, and between a State, or the citizens thereof, and\r\nforeign states, citizens or subjects.\r\n\r\n2. In all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and\r\nconsuls, and those in which a State shall be a party, the Supreme\r\nCourt shall have original jurisdiction. In all the other cases before\r\nmentioned, the Supreme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction, both\r\nas to law and fact, with such exceptions, and under such regulations\r\nas the Congress shall make.\r\n\r\n3. The trial of all crimes, except in cases of impeachment, shall be\r\nby jury; and such trial shall be held in the State where the said\r\ncrimes shall have been committed; but when not committed within any\r\nState, the trial shall be at such place or places as the Congress may\r\nby law have directed.\r\n\r\nSECT.
