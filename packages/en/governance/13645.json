The present edition\r\nhas been printed from a copy of the latter issue, which, as recorded on\r\nthe title-page, was \"revised and corrected by the Author\"; but I have\r\nhad by my side, for constant reference, a complete set of the folio\r\nsheets, containing the \"Lucubrations of Isaac Bickerstaff\" in the form\r\nin which they were first presented to the world. Scrupulous accuracy in\r\nthe text has been aimed at, but the eccentricities of spelling--which\r\nwere the printer's, not the author's--have not been preserved, and the\r\npunctuation has occasionally been corrected.\r\n\r\nThe first and the most valuable of the annotated editions of the\r\n_Tatler_ was published by John Nichols and others in 1786, with notes by\r\nDr. Percy, Bishop of Dromore, Dr. John Calder, and Dr. Pearce, Bishop\r\nof Rochester; and though these notes are often irrelevant and out of\r\ndate, they contain an immense amount of information, and have been\r\nfreely made use of by subsequent editors. I have endeavoured to preserve\r\nwhat is of value in the older editions, and to supplement it, as\r\nconcisely as possible, by such further information as appeared\r\ndesirable. The eighteenth-century diaries and letters published of late\r\nyears have in many cases enabled me to throw light on passages which\r\nhave hitherto been obscure, and sometimes useful illustrations have been\r\nfound in the contemporary newspapers and periodicals.\r\n\r\nThe portraits of Steele, Addison, and Swift, the writers most associated\r\nwith the _Tatler_, have been taken from contemporary engravings in the\r\nBritish Museum; and the imaginary portrait of Isaac Bickerstaff in the\r\nlast volume is from a rare picture drawn by Lens in 1710 as a\r\nfrontispiece to collections of the original folio numbers._\r\n\r\nG. A. A.\r\n\r\n_August 1898._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nWhen the first number of the _Tatler_ appeared in 1709, Steele and\r\nAddison were about thirty-seven years of age, while Swift, then still\r\ncounted among the Whigs, was more than four years their senior. Addison\r\nand Steele had been friends at the Charterhouse School and at Oxford,\r\nand though they had during the following years had varying experiences,\r\ntheir friendship had in no way lessened. Addison had been a fellow of\r\nhis college, had gained the patronage of Charles Montague and Lord\r\nSomers, had made the grand tour, and published an account of his\r\ntravels; had gained popularity by his poem \"The Campaign,\" written in\r\ncelebration of the victory at Blenheim; had been made an Under-Secretary\r\nof State, and finally (in December 1708) had been appointed secretary to\r\nLord Wharton, the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. Steele, on the other hand,\r\nhad enlisted in the Guards, without taking any degree; had obtained an\r\nensign's commission after dedicating to Lord Cutts a poem on Queen\r\nMary's death; and had written a little book called \"The Christian Hero,\"\r\ndesigned \"to fix upon his own mind a strong impression of virtue and\r\nreligion, in opposition to a stronger propensity towards unwarrantable\r\npleasures.\" At the close of the same year (1701) he brought out a\r\nsuccessful comedy, \"The Funeral,\" which was followed by \"The Lying\r\nLover\" and \"The Tender Husband,\" plays which gave strong evidence of the\r\ninfluence of Jeremy Collier's attack on the immorality of the stage.\r\n\"The Tender Husband\" owed \"many applauded strokes\" to Addison, to whom\r\nit was dedicated by Steele, who wished \"to show the esteem I have for\r\nyou, and that I look upon my intimacy with you as one of the most\r\nvaluable enjoyments of my life.\" In 1705 Steele married a lady with\r\nproperty in Barbados, and on her death married, in 1707, Mary Scurlock,\r\nthe \"dear Prue\" to whom he addressed his well-known letters. For the\r\nrest, he had been made gentleman-waiter to Prince George of Denmark, and\r\nappointed Gazetteer, with a salary of £300, less a tax of £45 a year. He\r\nwas disappointed in his hopes of obtaining the Under-Secretaryship\r\nvacated by Addison.\r\n\r\nFrom 1705 onwards there is evidence of frequent and familiar intercourse\r\nbetween Swift and Addison and Steele. After Sir William Temple's death,\r\nSwift had become chaplain to the Earl of Berkeley, who gave him the\r\nliving of Laracor; and during a visit to England in 1704 he had gained a\r\nposition in the front rank of authors by the \"Tale of a Tub\" and the\r\n\"Battle of the Books.\" At the close of 1707 he was again in England,\r\ncharged with a mission to obtain for the Irish clergy the remission of\r\nFirst Fruits and Tenths already conceded to the English, and throughout\r\n1708 what he calls \"the triumvirate of Addison, Steele and me\" were in\r\nconstant communication. In that year Swift published a pamphlet called\r\n\"A Project for the Advancement of Religion and the Reformation of\r\nManners,\" which anticipated many of the arguments used in the _Tatler_\r\nand _Spectator_; and he also commenced his attack on John Partridge,\r\nquack doctor and maker of astrological almanacs. On the appearance of\r\nPartridge's \"Merlinus Liberatus\" for 1708, Swift--borrowing a name from\r\nthe signboard of a shoemaker--published \"Predictions for the year 1708,\r\nwherein the month and day of the month are set down, the persons named,\r\nand the great actions and events of next year particularly related, as\r\nthey will come to pass. Written to prevent the people of England from\r\nbeing further imposed on by vulgar almanack-makers. By Isaac\r\nBickerstaff, Esq.\" Isaac Bickerstaff professed to be a true astrologer,\r\ndisgusted at the lies told by impostors, and he said that he was willing\r\nto be hooted at as a cheat if his prophecies were not exactly fulfilled.\r\nHis first prediction was that Partridge would die on the 29th of March;\r\nand on the 30th a second pamphlet was published, \"The accomplishment of\r\nthe first of Mr. Bickerstaff's Predictions ... in a letter to a person\r\nof quality, in which a detailed account is given of Partridge's death,\r\nat five minutes after seven, by which it is clear that Mr. Bickerstaff\r\nwas mistaken almost four hours in his calculation.... Whether he had\r\nbeen the cause of this poor man's death, as well as the predictor, may\r\nbe very reasonably disputed.\" The joke was maintained by Swift and\r\nothers in various pieces, and when Partridge, in his almanac for 1709,\r\nprotested that he was still living, Swift replied, in \"A Vindication of\r\nIsaac Bickerstaff, Esq.,\" which was advertised in the fifth number of\r\nthe _Tatler_, that he could prove that Partridge was not alive; for no\r\none living could have written such rubbish as the new almanac. In\r\nstarting his new paper Steele assumed the name of the astrologer Isaac\r\nBickerstaff, rendered famous by Swift, and made frequent use of Swift's\r\nleading idea. He himself summed up the controversy in the words, \"if a\r\nman's art is gone, the man is gone, though his body still appear.\"\r\n\r\nMuch has been written on the interesting question of the early history\r\nof the periodical press; but with one exception none of its predecessors\r\nhad much effect on the _Tatler_. John Dunton's _Athenian Mercury_ was\r\nthe forerunner of our _Notes and Queries_; and it was followed by the\r\n_British Apollo_ (1708-11), the second title of which was \"Curious\r\nAmusements for the Ingenious. To which are added the most Material\r\nOccurrences, Foreign and Domestic. Performed by a Society of Gentlemen.\"\r\n_The Gentleman's Journal_ of 1692-4, a monthly paper of poems and other\r\nmiscellaneous matter, was succeeded, in 1707, by Oldmixon's _Muses'\r\nMercury; or, The Monthly Miscellany_, a periodical which contained also\r\nnotices of new plays and books, and numbered Steele among its\r\ncontributors. Defoe's _Review_, begun in 1704, aimed at setting the\r\naffairs of Europe in a clearer light, regardless of party; but, added\r\nDefoe, \"After our serious matters are over, we shall at the end of every\r\npaper present you with a little diversion, as anything occurs to make\r\nthe world merry; and whether friend or foe, one party or another, if\r\nanything happens so scandalous as to require an open reproof, the world\r\nwill meet with it there.\" Accordingly, of the eight pages in the first\r\nnumber, one and a half pages consist of \"Mercure Scandale; or, Advice\r\nfrom the Scandalous Club, Translated out of French.\" The censure was to\r\nbe of the actions of men, not of parties; and the design was to expose\r\nnot persons but things. A monthly supplement, dealing with \"the\r\nimmediate subject then on the tongues of the town,\" was begun in\r\nSeptember 1704; and pressure on the space before long pushed the Advices\r\nfrom the Scandal Club out of the ordinary issue of the _Review_.\r\nSubsequently Defoe wrote more than once in praise of the way in which\r\nhis work had been taken up by Isaac Bickerstaff.\r\n\r\nProbably the _Tatler_ was started by Steele without any very definite\r\ndesigns for the future. According to the first number, published on\r\nApril 12, 1709, the aim was to instruct the public what to think, after\r\ntheir reading, and there was to be something for the entertainment of\r\nthe fair sex. The numbers were published three times a week, on the\r\npost-days, at the price of one penny. Each paper consisted of a single\r\nfolio sheet, and the first four were distributed gratuitously. Steele\r\nprobably thought that his position of Gazetteer would enable him to give\r\nthe latest news, and he says that these paragraphs brought in a\r\nmultitude of readers; but as the position of the _Tatler_ became\r\nestablished, the need for the support of these items of news grew less,\r\nand after the first eighty numbers they are of rare occurrence. Quite\r\nearly in the career of the paper Addison, speaking of the distress which\r\nwould be caused among the news-writers by the conclusion of a peace,\r\nsaid that Bickerstaff was not personally concerned in the matter; \"for\r\nas my chief scenes of action are coffee-houses, playhouses, and my own\r\napartment, I am in no need of camps, fortifications, and fields of\r\nbattle to support me.... I shall still be safe as long as there are men\r\nor women, or politicians, or lovers, or poets, or nymphs, or swains, or\r\ncits, or courtiers in being.\"[1]\r\n\r\nThe subject of each article was to be indicated by the name of the\r\ncoffee-house or other place from which it was supposed to come: \"All\r\naccounts of gallantry, pleasure, and entertainment shall be under the\r\narticle of White's Chocolate-house; Poetry, under that of Will's\r\nCoffee-house; Learning, under the title of Grecian; Foreign and Domestic\r\nNews you will have from Saint James's Coffee-house; and what else I have\r\nto offer on any other subject shall be dated from my own Apartment.\" For\r\nsome time each number contained short papers from all or several of\r\nthese places; but gradually it became usual to devote the whole number\r\nto one topic. The motto of the first forty numbers was \"Quicquid agunt\r\nhomines ... nostri farrago libelli\"; but in the following numbers it was\r\nchanged to \"Celebrare domestica facta\"; and afterwards each number\r\ngenerally had a quotation bearing upon the subject of the day. Writing\r\nsome time after the commencement of the fatter, Steele said, in the\r\nDedication prefixed to the first volume, \"The general purpose of this\r\npaper is to expose the false arts of life, to pull off the disguises of\r\ncunning, vanity, and affectation, and to recommend a general simplicity\r\nin our dress, our discourse, and our behaviour.\" And elsewhere he says:\r\n\"As for my labours, which he is pleased to inquire after, if they but\r\nwear one impertinence out of human life, destroy a single vice, or give\r\na morning's cheerfulness to an honest mind; in short, if the world can\r\nbe but one virtue the better, or in any degree less vicious, or receive\r\nfrom them the smallest addition to their innocent diversions; I shall\r\nnot think my pains, or indeed my life, to have been spent in vain.\"[2]\r\nAt the close, speaking in his own name, Steele wrote: \"The general\r\npurpose of the whole has been to recommend truth, innocence, honour, and\r\nvirtue, as the chief ornaments of life; but I considered, that severity\r\nof manners was absolutely necessary to him who would censure others, and\r\nfor that reason, and that only, chose to talk in a mask. I shall not\r\ncarry my humility so far as to call myself a vicious man, but at the\r\nsame time must confess my life is at best but pardonable.\"[3]\r\n\r\nWith his usual generosity, Steele more than once spoke in the warmest\r\nterms of the assistance rendered to him by Addison. In the preface to\r\nthe collected edition he said: \"I have only one gentleman, who will be\r\nnameless, to thank for any frequent assistance to me, which indeed it\r\nwould have been barbarous in him to have denied to one with whom he had\r\nlived in an intimacy from childhood, considering the great ease with\r\nwhich he is able to despatch the most entertaining pieces of this\r\nnature. This good office he performed with such force of genius, humour,\r\nwit, and learning that I fared like a distressed prince, who calls in a\r\npowerful neighbour to his aid; I was undone by my auxiliary; when I had\r\ncalled him in I could not subsist without dependence on him.\" And in\r\n1722, after Addison's death, in a preface to his friend's play, \"The\r\nDrummer,\" Steele wrote of the _Tatler_, \"That paper was advanced indeed!\r\nfor it was raised to a greater thing than I intended it! For the\r\nelegance, purity, and correctness which appeared in his writings were\r\nnot so much my purpose, as (in any intelligible manner, as I could) to\r\nrally all those singularities of human life, through the different\r\nprofessions and characters in it, which obstruct anything that was truly\r\ngood and great.\"\r\n\r\nIt is only fair to Steele to point out that the original idea of the\r\n_Tatler_ was entirely his own, and that he alone was responsible for the\r\nregular supply of material. Addison was in Ireland when the paper was\r\nbegun, and did not know who was the author until several numbers had\r\nappeared. His occasional contributions were of little importance until\r\nafter eighty numbers had been published; and of the whole 271 numbers\r\nSteele wrote about 188 and Addison only 42, while they were jointly\r\nresponsible for 36. Swift contributed only to about a dozen numbers; and\r\nthe assistance received from other writers was so slight that it does\r\nnot call for notice here. Steele, unlike Addison, was probably at his\r\nbest in the _Tatler_, where he had a freer hand, and described, in a\r\nperfectly fresh and unaffected style, the impressions of the moment.\r\nHastily composed in coffee-house or printing-office, as they often were,\r\nand at very short notice, his papers frequently appeal to the reader of\r\nthe present day more than the carefully elaborated and highly finished\r\nwork of his friend, who wrote only when he found a suitable topic. And\r\nif Addison's art is of a higher standard than Steele's, it is to Steele\r\nthat we owe Addison. A minor poet and the author of a book of travels\r\nand of an unsuccessful opera, Addison found no opportunity for his\r\npeculiar genius until his friend provided the means in the _Tatler_. It\r\nis tolerably certain that he would himself never have taken the\r\nnecessary step of founding a periodical appealing to the general public;\r\nand Steele himself said with perfect truth, \"I claim to myself the merit\r\nof having extorted excellent productions from a person of the greatest\r\nabilities, who would not have let them appear by any other means.\"[4]\r\n\r\nIf more is said here of Steele than of Addison, it is because it is\r\nSteele whose name is most intimately connected with the _Tatler_. The\r\nfield in which Addison shone brightest was the _Spectator_, where the\r\nwhole plan was arranged in the manner best suited to his genius. But his\r\ninfluence is, nevertheless, visible in the development of the earlier\r\npaper, and some of his individual articles are equal to anything he\r\nafterwards wrote. It is only necessary to mention his papers on the\r\nDistress of the News-Writers[5]; on the poetaster, Ned Softly[6]; on the\r\npedant and \"broker in learning,\" Tom Folio[7]; on the Political\r\nUpholsterer, who was more inquisitive to know what passed in Poland than\r\nin his own family[8]; and on the Adventures of a Shilling.[9] His, too,\r\nare the Vision of Justice[10]; the story of a dream;[11] and the amusing\r\naccount of the visit to London of Sir Harry Quickset, who, with his\r\nold-world breeding, was the forerunner of Sir Roger de Coverley.[12]\r\n\r\nUnlike the members of the Spectator's Club, the _dramatis personæ_\r\nintroduced in the _Tatler_ do not occupy a very prominent place in\r\nthe development of the work. Isaac Bickerstaff himself, an old man of\r\nsixty-four, \"a philosopher, an humourist, an astrologer, and a censor,\"\r\nis rather vaguely sketched, and his familiar, Pacolet, is made use of\r\nchiefly in the earlier numbers. The occasional references to Bickerstaff's\r\nhalf-sister, Jenny Distaff,[13] and her husband, Tanquillus, and to his\r\nthree nephews and their conduct in the presence of a \"beautiful woman of\r\nhonour,\"[14] gave Steele a framework for some charming sketches of\r\ndomestic life. It is not until No. 132 that we have the amusing account\r\nof the members of Bickerstaff's Club, the Trumpet, in Shire Lane. There\r\nwere Sir Geoffrey Notch, a gentleman of an ancient family, who had\r\nwasted his estate in his youth, and called every thriving man a pitiful\r\nupstart; Major Matchlock, with his reminiscences of the Civil War; Dick\r\nReptile, and the Bencher who was always praising the wit of former days,\r\nand telling stories of Jack Ogle, with whom he pretended to have been\r\nintimate in his youth. Very little use was afterwards made of this\r\npromising material.\r\n\r\nThe poet John Gay has given an excellent account of the work\r\naccomplished by Steele and Addison in a pamphlet called \"The Present\r\nState of Wit\" (1711). Speaking of the discontinuance of the _Tatler_, he\r\nsays: \"His disappearing seemed to be bewailed as some general calamity:\r\nevery one wanted so agreeable an amusement; and the coffee-houses began\r\nto be sensible that the Esquire's Lucubrations alone had brought them\r\nmore customers than all their other newspapers put together. It must,\r\nindeed, be confessed that never man threw up his pen under stronger\r\ntemptations to have employed it longer; his reputation was at a greater\r\nheight than, I believe, ever any living author's was before him....\r\nThere is this noble difference between him and all the rest of our\r\npolite and gallant authors: the latter have endeavoured to please the\r\nage by falling in with them, and encouraging them in their fashionable\r\nvices and false notions of things. It would have been a jest some time\r\nsince, for a man to have asserted that anything witty could be said in\r\npraise of a married state; or that devotion and virtue were any way\r\nnecessary to the character of a fine gentleman. Bickerstaff ventured to\r\ntell the town that they were a parcel of fops, fools, and vain\r\ncoquettes; but in such a manner as even pleased them, and made them more\r\nthan half inclined to believe that he spoke truth. Instead of complying\r\nwith the false sentiments or vicious tastes of the age, either in\r\nmorality, criticism, or good breeding, he has boldly assured them that\r\nthey were altogether in the wrong, and commanded them, with an authority\r\nwhich perfectly well became him, to surrender themselves to his\r\narguments for virtue and good sense.\r\n\r\n\"It is incredible to conceive the effect his writings have had on the\r\ntown; how many thousand follies they have either quite banished, or\r\ngiven a very great check to; how much countenance they have added to\r\nvirtue and religion; how many people they have rendered happy, by\r\nshowing them it was their own fault if they were not so; and, lastly,\r\nhow entirely they have convinced our fops and young fellows of the value\r\nand advantages of learning. He has indeed rescued it out of the hands of\r\npedants and fools, and discovered the true method of making it amiable\r\nand lovely to all mankind. In the dress he gives it, it is a most\r\nwelcome guest at tea-tables and assemblies, and is relished and caressed\r\nby the merchants on the 'Change; accordingly, there is not a lady at\r\nCourt, nor a banker in Lombard Street, who is not verily persuaded that\r\nCaptain Steele is the greatest scholar and best casuist of any man in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\n\"Lastly, his writings have set all our wits and men of letters upon a\r\nnew way of thinking, of which they had little or no notion before; and\r\nthough we cannot yet say that any of them have come up to the beauties\r\nof the original, I think we may venture to affirm that every one of them\r\nwrites and thinks much more justly than they did some time since.\"\r\n\r\nGay's opinion has been confirmed by the best judges of nearly two\r\ncenturies, and there is no need to labour the question of the wit and\r\nwisdom of the _Tatler_. But some examples may be cited in illustration\r\nof the topics on which Steele and his friends wrote, and the manner in\r\nwhich they dealt with them. The very first numbers contained\r\nillustrations of most of what were to be the characteristics of the\r\npaper. There is the account of the very pretty gentleman at White's\r\nChocolate-house thrown into a sad condition by a passing vision of a\r\nyoung lady; the notice of Betterton's benefit performance; the comments\r\non the war; the campaign against Partridge, with the declaration that\r\nall who were good for nothing would be included among the deceased; the\r\ndiscussion on the morality of the stage, with praise of Mrs. Bicknell\r\nand reproaches upon a young nobleman who came drunk to the play; the\r\ncomparison of the rival beauties, Chloe and Clarissa; the satire on the\r\nItalian opera, and on Pinkethman's company of strollers; and the\r\nallegorical paper on Fælicia, or Britain. All these and other matters\r\nare dealt with in the four numbers which were distributed gratuitously;\r\nas the work progressed the principal change, besides the disappearance\r\nof the paragraphs of news, was the development of the sustained essay on\r\nmorals or manners, and the less frequent indulgence in satire upon\r\nindividual offenders, and in personal allusions in general. This change\r\nseems to have been the result partly of design, and partly of\r\ncircumstances, including Addison's influence on the work. Steele himself\r\nsaid, as we have seen, that the _Tatler_ was raised to a greater height\r\nthan he had designed; but no doubt he realised that he must feel his\r\nway, and be at first a tatler rather than a preacher. After some grave\r\nremarks about duelling in an early paper (No. 26), he makes Pacolet,\r\nBickerstaff's familiar, say, \"It was too soon to give my discourse on\r\nthis subject so serious a turn; you have chiefly to do with that part of\r\nmankind which must be led into reflection by degrees, and you must treat\r\nthis custom with humour and raillery to get an audience, before you come\r\nto pronounce sentence upon it.\"\r\n\r\nFollies and weaknesses are ridiculed in the _Tatler_ in a genial\r\nspirit, by one who was fully alive to his own imperfections, and point\r\nis usually given to the papers by a sketch of some veiled or imaginary\r\nindividual. In this way Bickerstaff treats of fops,[15] of wags,[16] of\r\ncoquettes,[17] of the lady who condemned the vice of the age, meaning\r\nthe only vice of which she was not guilty;[18] of impudence;[19] and of\r\npride and vanity.[20] In a graver tone he attacks the practice of\r\nduelling;[21] gamesters and sharpers;[22] drunken \"roarers\" and\r\n\"scowrers\";[23] and brutal pastimes at the Bear Garden and\r\nelsewhere.[24] The campaign against swindlers exposed Steele to serious\r\nthreats on more than one occasion.[25]\r\n\r\nOf what Coleridge called Steele's \"pure humanity\" there is nowhere\r\nbetter evidence than in the _Tatler_. It is enough to cite once more the\r\nwell-known examples of the account of his father's death and his\r\nmother's grief;[26] the stories of Unnion and Valentine,[27] of the\r\nCornish lovers,[28] of Clarinda and Chloe,[29] and of Mr. Eustace,[30]\r\nand the charming account of the married happiness of an old friend, with\r\nthe pathetic picture of the death of the wife, and the grief of husband\r\nand children.[31] In the last number Steele said, \"It has been a most\r\nexquisite pleasure to me to frame characters of domestic life\"; and we\r\nknow from his letters that when he wrote of children he was only\r\nexpressing the deep affection which he felt for his own. Equally in\r\nadvance of his time was his respect for women, one of whom--Lady\r\nElizabeth Hastings--he has immortalised in the words, \"To love her is a\r\nliberal education.\"[32] In the same number he wrote, \"As charity is\r\nesteemed a conjunction of the good qualities necessary to a virtuous\r\nman, so love is the happy composition of all the accomplishments that\r\nmake a fine gentleman.\" In a time of much laxity he constantly dwelt on\r\nthe happiness of marriage; \"wife is the most amiable term in human\r\nlife.\"[33] But good nature must be cultivated if the married life is to\r\nbe happy,[34] and all unnecessary provocations avoided. \"Dear Jenny,\"\r\nsays Bickerstaff to his sister, \"remember me, and avoid\r\nSnap-Dragon.\"[35] Women must be rightly educated before they can expect\r\nto be treated by, and to influence men as they should.[36] The make of\r\nthe mind greatly contributes to the ornament of the body; \"there is so\r\nimmediate a relation between our thoughts and gestures that a woman must\r\nthink well to look well.\"[37] The habit of scandal-mongering and other\r\nweaknesses are the result of an improper training of the mind.[38] \"All\r\nwomen especially,\" says Thackeray, \"are bound to be grateful to Steele,\r\nas he was the first of our writers who really seemed to admire and\r\nrespect them.\" His pity extended to the hunted deer: \"I have more than\r\nonce rode off at the death,\" he says; \"to be apt to shed tears is a sign\r\nof a great as well as a little spirit.\"[39]\r\n\r\nSteele's teaching on morals and right living enters intimately into his\r\nliterary criticism. His love for Shakespeare was real and intelligent;\r\nthere is no formal discussion of the rules of the drama, but throughout\r\nthe _Tatler_ there are references which show the keenest appreciation\r\nof Shakespeare's powers as poet and philosopher. \"The vitiated tastes of\r\nthe audience at the theatre could only be amended,\" says Steele, \"by\r\nencouraging the representation of the noble characters drawn by\r\nShakespeare and others, from whence it is impossible to return without\r\nstrong impressions of honour and humanity. On these occasions, distress\r\nis laid before us with all its causes and consequences, and our\r\nresentment placed according to the merit of the persons afflicted. Were\r\ndramas of this nature more acceptable to the taste of the town, men who\r\nhave genius would bend their studies to excel in them.\"[40] Still more\r\nremarkable are the allusions to \"Paradise Lost,\" for Milton was then even\r\nless appreciated than Shakespeare. As in so many other things, Addison's\r\nmore elaborate criticism in the _Spectator_ was foreshadowed in the\r\n_Tatler_ by Steele; and the comparison of passages by Milton and\r\nDryden[41] must have been very striking to the reader of that time, who\r\nusually knew Shakespeare or Chaucer only through the adaptations of Dryden\r\nor Tate.\r\n\r\nThough it is not true, as some have represented, that the _Tatler_ is\r\nfor the most part a mere society journal, concerned chiefly with the\r\ngossip of the day, yet its contributors made use of the scenes and\r\nevents familiar to their readers in order to bring home the kindly\r\nlessons they wished to teach; and in so doing they have given us a\r\npicture of the daily life of the town which would alone have given\r\nlasting interest to the paper. The distinctly \"moral\" papers have had\r\ncountless imitators, and sometimes therefore they are apt to pall upon\r\nus, but the social articles are at least as interesting now as when they\r\nwere written, and one of the reasons why some excellent judges have\r\nprefered the _Tatler_ to the _Spectator_, is that there is a greater\r\nproportion of these gossiping papers, combining wisdom with satire, and\r\nbringing before us as in a mirror the London of Queen Anne's day.\r\nBickerstaff takes us from club to coffee-house, from St. James's to the\r\nExchange; we see the poets and wits at Will's, the politicians at\r\nWhite's, the merchants at Garraway's, the Templars at the Smyrna; we see\r\nBetterton and the rest on the stage, and the ladies and gentlemen in the\r\nfront or side boxes; we see Pinkethman's players at Greenwich, Powell's\r\npuppet-show, Don Saltero's Museum at Chelsea, and the bear-baiting and\r\nprize-fights at Hockley-in-the-Hole. We are taken to the Mall at St.\r\nJames's, or the Ring in Hyde Park, and we study the fine ladies and the\r\nbeaux, with their red heels and their amber-headed canes suspended from\r\ntheir waistcoats; or we follow them to Charles Lillie's, the perfumer,\r\nor to Mather's toy-shop, or to Motteux's china warehouse; or to the\r\nshops in the New Exchange, where the men bought trifles and ogled the\r\nattendants. Or yet again we watch the exposure of the sharpers and\r\nbullies, and the denunciation of others who brought even greater ruin on\r\nthose who fell into their clutches. We see the worshipping and the\r\nflirtations in the church, with Smalridge and Atterbury, Hoadly and\r\nBlackall among the preachers, and hear something of the controversies\r\nbetween High and Low Church, Whig and Tory. We hear, too, of the war\r\nwith France, and of the hopes of peace. Steele tells us not only of\r\nMarlborough and Prince Eugene, but of privates and non-commissioned\r\nofficers, of their lives and tragedies, of their comrades and friends.\r\nAll Sergeant Hall knew of the battle was that he wished there had not\r\nbeen so many killed; he had himself a very bad shot in the head, but\r\nwould recover, if it pleased God. \"To me,\" says Steele, recalling his\r\nown service as a trooper, \"I take the gallantry of private soldiers to\r\nproceed from the same, if not from a nobler impulse than that of\r\ngentlemen and officers.... Sergeant Hall would die ten thousand deaths\r\nrather than a word should be spoken at the Red Lattice, or any part of\r\nthe Butcher Row, in prejudice to his courage or honesty.\" His letter to\r\nhis friend was \"the picture of the bravest sort of man, that is to say,\r\na man of great courage and small hopes.\"[42]\r\n\r\nSomething must be said of the events of 1710, which led to the\r\ndiscontinuance of the _Tatler_. The trial of Dr. Sacheverell in March\r\nwas followed by the fall of the Whigs in the autumn; and in October\r\nSteele lost his post of Gazetteer. Swift says it was \"for writing a\r\n_Tatler_ some months ago, against Mr. Harley, who gave him the post at\r\nfirst.\" There was a growing coldness between Swift and his old friends,\r\nand on the 3rd of November Swift wrote, \"We have scurvy _Tatlers_ of\r\nlate, so pray do not suspect me.\" On the preceding day Swift's first\r\npaper in the Tory _Examiner_ had been published. He still met Steele\r\nfrom time to time, and he says that he interceded for him with Harley,\r\nbut was frustrated by Addison. However this may be, it is certain that\r\nHarley saw Steele, and that as the result of their interview Steele\r\nretained his post as Commissioner of the Stamp Office, and brought the\r\n_Tatler_ to a close on January 2, 1711, without consulting Addison. \"To\r\nsay the truth, it was time,\" says Swift; \"for he grew cruel dull and\r\ndry.\" It is true that there is a falling off towards the close of the\r\n_Tatler_, but that it was not want of matter that brought about the\r\nabandonment of the paper is proved by the commencement only two months\r\nlater of the _Spectator_. Steele himself said that on many accounts it\r\nhad become an irksome task to personate Mr. Bickerstaff any longer; he\r\nhad in some places touched upon matters concerning Church and State, and\r\nhe could not be cold enough to conceal his opinions. Gay tells us, in\r\n\"The Present State of Wit,\" that the town being generally of opinion\r\nthat Steele was quite spent as regards matter, was the more surprised\r\nwhen the _Spectator_ appeared; people were therefore driven to accept\r\nthe alternative view that the _Tatler_ was laid down \"as a sort of\r\nsubmission to, or composition with, the Government for some past\r\noffences.\"\r\n\r\nExcellent testimony to the immediate popularity of the _Tatler_ is\r\nfurnished by the fact that its successive numbers were reprinted in\r\nDublin and in Edinburgh. At least sixty-nine numbers of the Dublin\r\nissue, in quarto, were printed. The Scottish re-issue was a folio sheet,\r\ncommenced about February 1710, and continued until the close of the\r\npaper. The date of each number of the Edinburgh paper--\"printed by\r\nJames Watson, and sold at his shop next door to the Red Lion, opposite\r\nto the Lucken Booths\"--is five or six days later than that of the\r\noriginal issue; it was evidently worked off as soon as the London post\r\ncame in. Other evidence of the popularity of the _Tatler_ in the\r\nprovinces is afforded by the foundation of the \"Gentleman's Society\" at\r\nSpalding. Maurice Johnson, a native of Spalding and a member of the\r\nInner Temple, gives this account of the matter: \"In April 1709, that\r\ngreat genius Captain Richard Steele ... published the _Tatlers_, which,\r\nas they came out in half-sheets, were taken in by a gentleman, who\r\ncommunicated them to his acquaintances at the coffee-house then in the\r\nAbbey Yard; and these papers being universally approved as both\r\ninstructive and entertaining, they ordered them to be sent down thither,\r\nwith the Gazettes and Votes, for which they paid out of charity to the\r\nperson who kept the coffee-house, and they were accordingly had and read\r\nthere every post-day, generally aloud to the company, who would sit and\r\ntalk over the subject afterwards. This insensibly drew the men of sense\r\nand letters into a sociable way of conversing, and continued the next\r\nyear, 1710, until the publication of these papers desisted, which was in\r\nDecember, to their great regret.\" Afterwards the _Spectator_ was taken\r\nin, and a regular society was started in 1712, by the encouragement of\r\nAddison, Steele, and other members of Button's Club.\r\n\r\nOne indication of the popularity of the _Tatler_ in its own day is the\r\nlong subscription list prefixed to the reprint in four octavo volumes.\r\nSome copies were printed on \"royal,\" others on \"medium\" paper; and the\r\nprice of the former was a guinea a volume, while that of the latter was\r\nhalf a guinea. There was also an authorised cheap edition, in duodecimo,\r\nat half a crown a volume, besides a pirated edition at the same price. A\r\nstill more conclusive proof of the success of the _Tatler_ was the\r\nnumber of papers started in imitation of its methods. Addison mentioned\r\nsome of those periodicals in No. 229, where details will be found of the\r\n\"Female Tatler,\" \"Tit for Tat,\" and the like. But besides these, several\r\nspurious continuations of the _Tatler_ appeared directly after the\r\ndiscontinuance of the genuine paper, including one by William Harrison,\r\nwritten with Swift's encouragement and assistance. But Harrison, as\r\nSwift said, had \"not the true vein for it,\" and his paper reached only\r\nto fifty-two numbers, which were afterwards reprinted as a fifth volume\r\nto the collected edition of the original _Tatler_. Gay said that\r\nSteele's imitators seemed to think \"that what was only the garnish of\r\nthe former _Tatlers_ was that which recommended them, and not those\r\nsubstantial entertainments which they everywhere abound in.\" The town,\r\nin the absence of anything better, welcomed their occasional and faint\r\nendeavours at humour; \"but even those are at present become wholly\r\ninvisible, and quite swallowed up in the blaze of the _Spectator_.\"\r\nSteele himself said that his imitators held the censorship in\r\ncommission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: No. 18.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: No. 89.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: No. 271.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: _Spectator_, No. 532.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: _Tatler_, No. 18.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: No. 163.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: No. 158.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Nos. 155, 160.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: No. 249.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: Nos. 100, 102.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: No. 117.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: No. 86.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: No. 10.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: No. 30.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: No. 142.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: No. 184.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: No. 27.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: No. 210.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: No. 168.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: Nos. 127, 186.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: Nos. 25, 26, 29, 31, 38, 39.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: Nos. 56, &c.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: Nos. 40, 45.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: No. 134.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: See Nos. 115, 271.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: No. 181.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: No. 5.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28: No. 82.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 29: No. 94.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 30: No. 172.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 31: Nos. 95, 114.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 32: No. 49.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33: No. 33.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 34: No. 149.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 35: No. 85.

I shall do this in very few words; for when\r\na man has no design but to speak plain truth, he may say a great deal in\r\na very narrow compass. I have in the dedication of the first volume made\r\nmy acknowledgments to Dr. Swift, whose pleasant writings, in the name of\r\nBickerstaff, created an inclination in the town towards anything that\r\ncould appear in the same disguise. I must acknowledge also, that at my\r\nfirst entering upon this work, a certain uncommon way of thinking, and a\r\nturn in conversation peculiar to that agreeable gentleman, rendered his\r\ncompany very advantageous to one whose imagination was to be continually\r\nemployed upon obvious and common subjects, though at the same time\r\nobliged to treat of them in a new and unbeaten method. His verses on the\r\nShower in Town,[44] and the Description of the Morning,[45] are\r\ninstances of the happiness of that genius, which could raise such\r\npleasing ideas upon occasions so barren to an ordinary invention.\r\n\r\nWhen I am upon the house of Bickerstaff, I must not forget that\r\ngenealogy of the family sent to me by the post, and written, as I since\r\nunderstand, by Mr. Twysden,[46] who died at the battle of Mons, and has\r\na monument in Westminster Abbey, suitable to the respect which is due to\r\nhis wit and his valour. There are through the course of the work very\r\nmany incidents which were written by unknown correspondents. Of this\r\nkind is the tale in the second _Tatler_, and the epistle from Mr. Downes\r\nthe prompter,[47] with others which were very well received by the\r\npublic. But I have only one gentleman,[48] who will be nameless, to\r\nthank for any frequent assistance to me, which indeed it would have been\r\nbarbarous in him to have denied to one with whom he has lived in an\r\nintimacy from childhood, considering the great ease with which he is\r\nable to dispatch the most entertaining pieces of this nature. This good\r\noffice he performed with such force of genius, humour, wit and learning,\r\nthat I fared like a distressed prince who calls in a powerful neighbour\r\nto his aid; I was undone by my auxiliary; when I had once called him in,\r\nI could not subsist without dependence on him.\r\n\r\nThe same hand writ the distinguishing characters of men and women under\r\nthe names of Musical Instruments, the Distress of the News-writers, the\r\nInventory of the Playhouse, and the Description of the Thermometer,[49]\r\nwhich I cannot but look upon as the greatest embellishments of this\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nThus far I thought necessary to say relating to the great hands which\r\nhave been concerned in these volumes, with relation to the spirit and\r\ngenius of the work; and am far from pretending to modesty in making this\r\nacknowledgment. What a man obtains from the good opinion and friendship\r\nof worthy men, is a much greater honour than he can possibly reap from\r\nany accomplishments of his own. But all the credit of wit which was\r\ngiven me by the gentlemen above mentioned (with whom I have now\r\naccounted) has not been able to atone for the exceptions made against me\r\nfor some raillery in behalf of that learned advocate for the episcopacy\r\nof the Church, and the liberty of the people, Mr. Hoadly. I mention this\r\nonly to defend myself against the imputation of being moved rather by\r\nparty than opinion;[50] and I think it is apparent, I have with the\r\nutmost frankness allowed merit wherever I found it, though joined in\r\ninterests different from those for which I have declared myself. When my\r\nFavonius[51] is acknowledged to be Dr. Smalridge, and the amiable\r\ncharacter of the dean in the sixty-sixth _Tatler_ drawn for Dr.\r\nAtterbury, I hope I need say no more as to my impartiality.\r\n\r\nI really have acted in these cases with honesty, and am concerned it\r\nshould be thought otherwise: for wit, if a man had it, unless it be\r\ndirected to some useful end, is but a wanton frivolous quality; all that\r\none should value himself upon in this kind is, that he had some\r\nhonourable intention in it.\r\n\r\nAs for this point, never hero in romance was carried away with a more\r\nfurious ambition to conquer giants and tyrants, than I have been in\r\nextirpating gamesters and duellists. And indeed, like one of those\r\nknights too, though I was calm before, I am apt to fly out again, when\r\nthe thing that first disturbed me is presented to my imagination. I\r\nshall therefore leave off when I am well, and fight with windmills no\r\nmore: only shall be so arrogant as to say of myself, that in spite of\r\nall the force of fashion and prejudice, in the face of all the world, I\r\nalone bewailed the condition of an English gentleman, whose fortune and\r\nlife are at this day precarious; while his estate is liable to the\r\ndemands of gamesters, through a false sense of justice; and to the\r\ndemands of duellists, through a false sense of honour. As to the first\r\nof these orders of men, I have not one word more to say of them: as to\r\nthe latter, I shall conclude all I have more to offer against them (with\r\nrespect to their being prompted by the fear of shame) by applying to the\r\nduellist what I think Dr. South says somewhere of the liar, \"He is a\r\ncoward to man, and a brave to God.\"\r\n\r\n_To_ Mr. Maynwaring.[52]\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nThe state of conversation and business in this town having been long\r\nperplexed with pretenders in both kinds, in order to open men's eyes\r\nagainst such abuses, it appeared no unprofitable undertaking to publish\r\na paper which should observe upon the manners of the pleasureable, as\r\nwell as the busy part of mankind. To make this generally read, it seemed\r\nthe most proper method to form it by way of a letter of intelligence,\r\nconsisting of such parts as might gratify the curiosity of persons of\r\nall conditions, and of each sex. But a work of this nature requiring\r\ntime to grow into the notice of the world, it happened very luckily,\r\nthat a little before I had resolved upon this design, a gentleman[53]\r\nhad written Predictions, and two or three other pieces in my name, which\r\nhad rendered it famous through all parts of Europe; and by an inimitable\r\nspirit and humour, raised it to as high a pitch of reputation as it\r\ncould possibly arrive at.\r\n\r\nBy this good fortune, the name of Isaac Bickerstaff gained an audience\r\nof all who had any taste of wit, and the addition of the ordinary\r\noccurrences of common journals of news brought in a multitude of other\r\nreaders. I could not, I confess, long keep up the opinion of the town,\r\nthat these lucubrations were written by the same hand with the first\r\nworks which were published under my name; but before I lost the\r\nparticipation of that author's fame, I had already found the advantage\r\nof his authority, to which I owe the sudden acceptance which my labours\r\nmet with in the world.\r\n\r\nThe general purpose of this paper, is to expose the false arts of life,\r\nto pull off the disguises of cunning, vanity, and affectation, and\r\nrecommend a general simplicity in our dress, our discourse, and our\r\nbehaviour. No man has a better judgment for the discovery, or a nobler\r\nspirit for the contempt of such impostures, than your self; which\r\nqualities render you the most proper patron for the author of these\r\nessays. In the general, the design, however executed, has met with so\r\ngreat success, that there is hardly a name now eminent among us for\r\npower, wit, beauty, valour, or wisdom, which is not subscribed, for the\r\nencouragement of the two volumes in octavo, on a royal or medium\r\npaper.[54] This is indeed an honour, for which it is impossible to\r\nexpress a suitable gratitude; and there is nothing could be an addition\r\nto the pleasure I take in it, but the reflection that it gives me the\r\nmost conspicuous occasion I can ever have, of subscribing myself,\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nYour most obliged, most obedient, and most humble Servant,\r\n\r\nISAAC BICKERSTAFF.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 43: This Preface was originally prefixed to the fourth volume\r\nof the collected edition issued in 1710-11.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 44: No. 238.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 45: No. 9.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 46: See No. 11.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 47: No. 193.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 48: Addison.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 49: Nos. 153, 18, 42, 220.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 50: Benjamin Hoadly, afterwards Bishop of Bangor, Salisbury,\r\nand Winchester, successively, was in 1709 engaged in controversy with\r\nDr. Francis Atterbury, who represented the high-church party.

He was born in 1668, at\r\nIghtfield, Shropshire, and was educated at the Shrewsbury Grammar School\r\nand at Christ Church, Oxford, where Smalridge was his tutor. Filled with\r\nprejudices against the Revolution, he came to London to study law, but a\r\npolitical satire which he published brought him under Dryden's notice,\r\nand the kind reception given him by several Whig statesmen, to whom he\r\nwas introduced, caused him to change his views on politics, and after\r\nhis father's death in 1693 he gave up the law and determined to push his\r\nfortunes at the Court. He was made a Commissioner of Customs and\r\nafterwards Auditor of the Imprests. He was admitted to the Kit-Cat Club,\r\nand in 1706 the interest of Godolphin procured him a seat in the House\r\nof Commons. Upon the fall of the Whig ministry in 1710, Maynwaring set\r\nup the _Medley_, a weekly paper in which the attacks of the _Examiner_\r\nwere answered, and wrote various political pamphlets. But his health\r\nsoon broke down, and he died in November, 1712. Mrs. Oldfield, the\r\nactress, was the sole executrix of his will, by which he divided his\r\nsmall property of some £3000 between her, a son that he had by her, and\r\nhis sister. There appear to have been many good points in his character.\r\nHis \"Life and Posthumous Works\" were published by Oldmixon in 1715.\r\n\"Maynwaring, whom we hear nothing of now, was the ruling man in all\r\nconversations, indeed what he wrote had very little merit in it\" (Pope,\r\nin Spence's \"Anecdotes,\" 1820, p. 338).

Now these gentlemen, for the most part, being men of strong zeal\r\nand weak intellects, it is both a charitable and necessary work to offer\r\nsomething, whereby such worthy and well-affected members of the\r\ncommonwealth may be instructed, after their reading, what to think;\r\nwhich shall be the end and purpose of this my paper: wherein I shall\r\nfrom time to time report and consider all matters of what kind soever\r\nthat shall occur to me, and publish such my advices and reflections\r\nevery Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday in the week for the convenience\r\nof the post.[56] I have also resolved to have something which may be of\r\nentertainment to the fair sex, in honour of whom I have taken the title\r\nof this paper. I therefore earnestly desire all persons, without\r\ndistinction, to take it in for the present gratis, and hereafter at the\r\nprice of one penny, forbidding all hawkers to take more for it at their\r\nperil. And I desire my readers to consider, that I am at a very great\r\ncharge for proper materials for this work, as well as that before I\r\nresolved upon it, I had settled a correspondence in all parts of the\r\nknown and knowing world. And forasmuch as this globe is not trodden upon\r\nby mere drudges of business only, but that men of spirit and genius are\r\njustly to be esteemed as considerable agents in it, we shall not, upon a\r\ndearth of news, present you with musty foreign edicts, or dull\r\nproclamations, but shall divide our relation of the passages which occur\r\nin action or discourse throughout this town, as well as elsewhere, under\r\nsuch dates of places as may prepare you for the matter you are to\r\nexpect, in the following manner:\r\n\r\nAll accounts of gallantry, pleasure, and entertainment, shall be under\r\nthe article of White's Chocolate-house;[57] poetry, under that of Will's\r\nCoffee-house;[58] learning, under the title of Grecian;[59] foreign and\r\ndomestic news, you will have from St. James's Coffee-house;[60] and what\r\nelse I shall on any other subject offer, shall be dated from my own\r\napartment.\r\n\r\nI once more desire my readers to consider that as I cannot keep an\r\ningenious man to go daily to Will's under twopence each day merely\r\nfor his charges,[61] to White's under sixpence, nor to the Grecian\r\nwithout allowing him some plain Spanish,[62] to be as able as others at\r\nthe learned table; and that a good observer cannot speak with even\r\nKidney[63] at St. James's without clean linen; I say, these\r\nconsiderations will, I hope, make all persons willing to comply with my\r\nhumble request (when my gratis stock is exhausted) of a penny a piece;\r\nespecially since they are sure of some proper amusement, and that it is\r\nimpossible for me to want means to entertain them, having, besides the\r\nhelps of my own parts, the power of divination, and that I can, by\r\ncasting a figure, tell you all that will happen before it comes to pass.\r\n\r\nBut this last faculty I shall use very sparingly, and not speak of\r\nanything until it is passed, for fear of divulging matters which may\r\noffend our superiors.[64]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhite's Chocolate-house, April 11.\r\n\r\nThe deplorable condition of a very pretty gentleman, who walks here at\r\nthe hours when men of quality first appear, is what is very much\r\nlamented. His history is, that on the 9th of September, 1705, being in\r\nhis one and twentieth year, he was washing his teeth at a tavern window\r\nin Pall Mall, when a fine equipage passed by, and in it a young lady,\r\nwho looked up at him; away goes the coach, and the young gentleman\r\npulled off his nightcap, and instead of rubbing his gums, as he ought to\r\ndo out of the window till about four o'clock, he sits him down, and\r\nspoke not a word till twelve at night; after which, he began to inquire,\r\nif anybody knew the lady. The company asked, \"What lady?\" But he said no\r\nmore until they broke up at six in the morning. All the ensuing winter\r\nhe went from church to church every Sunday, and from play-house to\r\nplay-house all the week, but could never find the original of the\r\npicture which dwelt in his bosom. In a word, his attention to anything\r\nbut his passion, was utterly gone. He has lost all the money he ever\r\nplayed for, and been confuted in every argument he has entered upon\r\nsince the moment he first saw her. He is of a noble family, has\r\nnaturally a very good air, and is of a frank, honest temper: but this\r\npassion has so extremely mauled him, that his features are set and\r\nuninformed, and his whole visage is deadened by a long absence of\r\nthought. He never appears in any alacrity, but when raised by wine; at\r\nwhich time he is sure to come hither, and throw away a great deal of wit\r\non fellows, who have no sense further than just to observe, that our\r\npoor lover has most understanding when he is drunk, and is least in his\r\nsenses when he is sober.[65]\r\n\r\n\r\nWill's Coffee-house, April 8.\r\n\r\nOn Thursday last[66] was presented, for the benefit of Mr.\r\nBetterton,[67] the celebrated comedy, called \"Love for Love.\"[68] Those\r\nexcellent players, Mrs. Barry,[69] Mrs. Bracegirdle,[70] and Mr.\r\nDoggett,[71] though not at present concerned in the house, acted on that\r\noccasion. There has not been known so great a concourse of persons of\r\ndistinction as at that time; the stage itself was covered with gentlemen\r\nand ladies, and when the curtain was drawn, it discovered even there a\r\nvery splendid audience. This unusual encouragement, which was given to a\r\nplay for the advantage of so great an actor, gives an undeniable\r\ninstance, that the true relish for manly entertainments and rational\r\npleasures is not wholly lost. All the parts were acted to perfection;\r\nthe actors were careful of their carriage, and no one was guilty of the\r\naffectation to insert witticisms of his own, but a due respect was had\r\nto the audience, for encouraging this accomplished player. It is not now\r\ndoubted but plays will revive, and take their usual place in the opinion\r\nof persons of wit and merit, notwithstanding their late apostacy in\r\nfavour of dress and sound. This place is very much altered since Mr.\r\nDryden frequented it; where you used to see songs, epigrams, and satires\r\nin the hands of every man you met, you have now only a pack of cards;\r\nand instead of the cavils about the turn of the expression, the elegance\r\nof the style, and the like, the learned now dispute only about the truth\r\nof the game. But, however the company is altered, all have shown a great\r\nrespect for Mr. Betterton: and the very gaming part of this house have\r\nbeen so much touched with a sense of the uncertainty of human affairs\r\n(which alter with themselves every moment) that in this gentleman, they\r\npitied Mark Antony of Rome, Hamlet of Denmark, Mithridates of Pontus,\r\nTheodosius of Greece, and Henry the Eighth of England. It is well known\r\nhe has been in the condition of each of those illustrious personages for\r\nseveral hours together, and behaved himself in those high stations, in\r\nall the changes of the scene, with suitable dignity. For these reasons,\r\nwe intend to repeat this favour to him on a proper occasion, lest he who\r\ncan instruct us so well in personating feigned sorrows, should be lost\r\nto us by suffering under real ones. The town is at present in very great\r\nexpectation of seeing a comedy now in rehearsal, which is the\r\ntwenty-fifth production of my honoured friend Mr. Thomas D'Urfey;[72]\r\nwho, besides his great abilities in the dramatic, has a peculiar talent\r\nin the lyric way of writing, and that with a manner wholly new and\r\nunknown to the ancient Greeks and Romans, wherein he is but faintly\r\nimitated in the translations of the modern Italian operas.[73]\r\n\r\n\r\nSt. James's Coffee-house, April 11.\r\n\r\nLetters from the Hague of the 16th say, that Major-General Cadogan[74]\r\nwas gone to Brussels, with orders to disperse proper instructions for\r\nassembling the whole force of the allies in Flanders in the beginning of\r\nthe next month.[75] The late offers concerning peace were made in the\r\nstyle of persons who think themselves upon equal terms. But the allies\r\nhave so just a sense of their present advantages, that they will not\r\nadmit of a treaty, except France offers what is more suitable to her\r\npresent condition. At the same time we make preparations, as if we were\r\nalarmed by a greater force than that which we are carrying into the\r\nfield. Thus this point seems now to be argued sword in hand. This was\r\nwhat a great general[76] alluded to, when being asked the names of those\r\nwho were to be plenipotentiaries for the ensuing peace, answered, with a\r\nserious air, \"There are about a hundred thousand of us.\" Mr. Kidney, who\r\nhas the ear of the greatest politicians that come hither, tells me,\r\nthere is a mail come in to-day with letters, dated Hague, April 19,\r\nN.S., which say, a design of bringing part of our troops into the field\r\nat the latter end of this month, is now altered to a resolution of\r\nmarching towards the camp about the 20th of the next. There happened the\r\nother day, in the road of Scheveling, an engagement between a privateer\r\nof Zealand and one of Dunkirk. The Dunkirker, carrying 33 pieces of\r\ncannon, was taken and brought into the Texel. It is said, the courier of\r\nMonsieur Rouillé[77] is returned to him from the Court of France.\r\nMonsieur Vendôme being reinstated in the favour of the Duchess of\r\nBurgundy, is to command in Flanders.\r\n\r\nMr. Kidney added, that there were letters of the 17th from Ghent, which\r\ngive an account, that the enemy had formed a design to surprise two\r\nbattalions of the allies which lay at Alost; but those battalions\r\nreceived advice of their march, and retired to Dendermond.\r\nLieutenant-General Wood[78] appeared on this occasion at the head of\r\n5000 foot, and 1000 horse, upon which the enemy withdrew, without making\r\nany further attempt.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom my own Apartment.\r\n\r\nI am sorry I am obliged to trouble the public with so much discourse\r\nupon a matter which I at the very first mentioned as a trifle--viz. the\r\ndeath of Mr. Partridge,[79] under whose name there is an almanack come\r\nout for the year 1709, in one page of which it is asserted by the said\r\nJohn Partridge, that he is still living, and that not only so, but that\r\nhe was also living some time before, and even at the instant when I writ\r\nof his death. I have in another place, and in a paper by itself,\r\nsufficiently convinced this man that he is dead, and if he has any\r\nshame, I don't doubt but that by this time he owns it to all his\r\nacquaintance: for though the legs and arms, and whole body of that man\r\nmay still appear and perform their animal functions; yet since, as I\r\nhave elsewhere observed, his art is gone, the man is gone. I am, as I\r\nsaid, concerned, that this little matter should make so much noise; but\r\nsince I am engaged, I take myself obliged in honour to go on in my\r\nlucubrations, and by the help of these arts of which I am master, as\r\nwell as my skill in astrological speculations, I shall, as I see\r\noccasion, proceed to confute other dead men, who pretend to be in being,\r\nthat they are actually deceased. I therefore give all men fair warning\r\nto mend their manners, for I shall from time to time print bills of\r\nmortality; and I beg the pardon of all such who shall be named therein,\r\nif they who are good for nothing shall find themselves in the number of\r\nthe deceased.[80]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 55: This motto was repeated at the head of each of the first\r\n40 numbers in the folio issue.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 56: These were the days on which the post left London for the\r\ndifferent parts of the country.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 57: White's Chocolate-house, five doors from the bottom of the\r\nwest side of St. James's Street, was established in 1698.

Plate VI. of Hogarth's\r\n\"Rake's Progress\" depicts gamblers engrossed in play in a room in this\r\nhouse during the fire; see also Plate IV. Swift gives it a bad character\r\nin his \"Essay on Modern Education;\" it had a strong character for\r\ngambling (Timbs's \"Clubs and Club Life in London,\" where, at p. 48,\r\nthere is a sketch of White's from an old drawing). The house became a\r\nprivate club, as we now have it, about 1736.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 58: Will's Coffee-house, named after Will Urwin, its\r\nproprietor, was the corner house on the north side of Russell Street,\r\nCovent Garden, at the end of Bow Street. The present house, 21 Russell\r\nStreet, is probably part of the old building. Will's was ceasing to be\r\nthe resort of the wits in 1709; it was in its glory at the close of the\r\nseventeenth century. The wits' room, where Dryden presided, was on the\r\nfirst floor.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 59: The Grecian, in Devereux Court in the Strand, was probably\r\nthe most ancient coffee-house in or about London. In 1652 an English\r\nTurkey merchant brought home with him a Greek servant, who first opened\r\na house for making and selling coffee. This man's name was Constantine,\r\nand his house was much resorted to by lawyers, Greek scholars, and\r\nMembers of the Royal Society. (See Thoresby's Diary, i. 111, 117.) Foote\r\nand Goldsmith afterwards frequented it. In Dr. King's \"Anecdotes\" there\r\nis a story of two gentlemen friends who disputed at the Grecian\r\nCoffee-house about the accent of a Greek word to such a length that they\r\nwent out into Devereux Court and drew swords, when one of them was\r\nkilled on the spot.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 60: The St. James's Coffee-house was the last house but one on\r\nthe S.W. corner of St. James's Street. It was frequented by Whig\r\nstatesmen, and was closed about 1806.

Cibber says: \"I never heard a line in tragedy come\r\nfrom Betterton wherein my judgment, my ear and my imagination were not\r\nfully satisfied.... The person of this excellent actor was suitable to\r\nhis voice, more manly than sweet, not exceeding the middle stature,\r\ninclining to be corpulent; of a serious and penetrating aspect; his\r\nlimbs nearer the athletic than the delicate proportion; yet, however\r\nformed, there arose from the harmony of the whole a commanding mien of\r\nmajesty.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 68: By Congreve, 1695.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 69: Mrs. Elizabeth Barry on this occasion spoke an epilogue,\r\nwritten by Rowe. She was the daughter of Edward Barry, barrister, whose\r\nfortunes were ruined by his attachment to Charles I. Tony Aston, in his\r\n\"Supplement to Cibber's Apology,\" says she was woman to Lady Shelton, of\r\nNorfolk, his godmother; and Curll tells us that she was early taken\r\nunder the protection of Lady Davenant. She was certainly on the stage in\r\n1673. At her first appearance there was so little hope of her success,\r\nthat at the end of the season she was discharged [from] the theatre. It\r\nis probable that at this time she became acquainted with Lord Rochester,\r\nwho took her under his protection, and gave her instructions in her\r\ntheatrical performances. By his interest she seems to have been restored\r\nto the stage, and, improving daily in her profession, she soon eclipsed\r\nall her competitors, and in the part of Monimia in \"The Orphan\"\r\nestablished her reputation, which was enhanced by her performance as\r\nBelvidera in \"Venice Preserved,\" and as Isabella in \"The Fatal\r\nMarriage.\" \"In characters of greatness,\" says Cibber, \"Mrs. Barry had a\r\npresence of elevated dignity, her mien and motion superb, and gracefully\r\nmajestic; her voice full, clear, and strong, so that no violence of\r\npassion could be too much for her, and when distress or tenderness\r\npossessed her she subsided into the most affecting melody and softness.\r\nIn the art of exciting pity she had a power beyond all the actresses I\r\nhave yet seen, or what your imagination can conceive. In scenes of\r\nanger, defiance, or resentment, while she was impetuous and terrible,\r\nshe poured out the sentiment with an enchanting harmony.... In tragedy\r\nshe was solemn and august, in comedy alert, easy, and genteel, pleasant\r\nin her face and action, filling the stage with a variety of gesture. She\r\ncould neither sing nor dance, no not in a country dance. She adhered to\r\nBetterton in all the revolutions of the theatre, which she quitted about\r\n1707, on account of ill-health.\" She returned, however, for one night\r\nwith Mrs. Bracegirdle, April 7, 1709, and performed Mrs. Frail in \"Love\r\nfor Love\" for Betterton's benefit. She died at Acton in 1713. Mrs.\r\nBarry, Mrs. Bracegirdle, Mr. Betterton, and Mr. Varbriggen were sworn as\r\nComedians in Ordinary to her Majesty, 30th Oct., 2 Anne (1703). On the\r\n3rd March, 1692, Mrs. Barry received £25 for acting in \"The Orphan\"\r\nbefore their Majesties, and on the 10th June, 1693, £25 for Caius\r\nMarius. (Lord Chamberlain's Records, Warrant Books, No. 20, p. 151; No.\r\n18, pp. 30, 242.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 70: Mrs. Anne Bracegirdle was the daughter of Justinian\r\nBracegirdle, of Northamptonshire. By the imprudence of her father, who\r\nruined himself by becoming surety for some friends, she was early left\r\nto the care of Betterton and his wife, whose attentions to her she\r\nalways acknowledged to be truly paternal. By them she was first\r\nintroduced to the stage, and, while very young, performed the page in\r\n\"The Orphan.\" Increasing in years, and in ability, she became the\r\nfavourite performer of the times. Cibber describes her in these terms:\r\n\"Mrs. Bracegirdle was now but just blooming in her maturity; her\r\nreputation, as an actress, gradually rising with that of her person;\r\nnever any woman was in such general favour of her spectators, which, to\r\nthe last scene of her dramatic life, she maintained by not being\r\nunguarded in her private character. This discretion contributed not a\r\nlittle to make her the _Cara_, the darling of the theatre: for it will\r\nbe no extravagant thing to say scarce an audience saw her that were less\r\nthan half of them lovers, without a suspected favourite among them: and\r\nthough she might be said to have been the universal passion and under\r\nthe highest temptations, her constancy in resisting them served but to\r\nincrease the number of her admirers. And this perhaps you will more\r\neasily believe, when I extend not my encomiums on her person beyond a\r\nsincerity that can be suspected; for she had no greater claim to beauty\r\nthan what the most desirable brunette might pretend to. But her youth\r\nand lively aspect threw out such a glow of health and cheerfulness,\r\nthat, on the stage, few spectators that were not past it, could behold\r\nher without desire. There were two very different characters in which\r\nshe acquitted herself with uncommon applause: if anything could excuse\r\nthat desperate extravagance of love, that almost frantic passion of\r\nLee's Alexander the Great, it must have been when Mrs. Bracegirdle was\r\nhis Statira: as when she acted Millamant, all the faults, follies, and\r\naffectation of that agreeable tyrant were venially melted down into so\r\nmany charms and attractions of a conscious beauty.\" In the theatrical\r\ndisputes of the times, she adhered to her benefactor Betterton, and\r\ncontinued to perform with applause until 1707, when, on the preference\r\nbeing given to Mrs. Oldfield in a contention between that actress and\r\nMrs. Bracegirdle, she left the stage, except for one night, when she\r\nreturned with Mrs. Barry to the theatre, and performed Angelica for\r\nBetterton's benefit (the performance described in this number). She died\r\nin 1748.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 71: Thomas Doggett died in 1721. In 1695 he created the\r\ncharacter of Ben in Congreve's \"Love for Love.\" Afterwards he was\r\nassociated with Steele in the management of Drury Lane Theatre.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 72: D'Urfey's \"Modern Prophets\" was produced in 1709. Thomas\r\nD'Urfey died in 1723, aged 70, leaving Steele a watch and chain, which\r\nhis friend wore at the funeral. He wrote many plays and songs.

The negotiations, however, fell through for the time, and the\r\ncampaign was begun in the Netherlands, where Marlborough and Prince\r\nEugene had an army of 110,000 men. The French were entrenched under\r\nVillars between Douay and Béthune, and were strengthened by part of the\r\ngarrison of Tournay. Marlborough seized the opportunity of attacking the\r\nhalf-defended town, which was obliged to surrender on July 29, after a\r\nsiege of nineteen days. The French then made a great effort, and brought\r\nan army of 100,000 men into the field, with the result that the battle\r\nof Malplaquet (Sept. 11) was a very bloody and hard-earned victory for\r\nthe allies.

The\r\nsubject of it being matter very useful for families, I thought it\r\ndeserved to be considered, and made more public. The turn the poet[81]\r\ngives it is very happy; but the foundation is from a real accident\r\nwhich happened among my acquaintance.[82] A young gentleman of a great\r\nestate fell desperately in love with a great beauty of very high\r\nquality, but as ill-natured as long flattery and an habitual self-will\r\ncould make her. However, my young spark ventures upon her, like a man of\r\nquality, without being acquainted with her, or having ever saluted her,\r\ntill it was a crime to kiss any woman else. Beauty is a thing which\r\npalls with possession; and the charms of this lady soon wanted the\r\nsupport of good humour and complaisancy of manners. Upon this my spark\r\nflies to the bottle for relief from his satiety. She disdains him for\r\nbeing tired with that for which all men envied him; and he never came\r\nhome, but it was: \"Was there no sot that would stay longer? Would any\r\nman living but you? Did I leave all the world for this usage?\" To which\r\nhe: \"Madam, split me, you are very impertinent!\" In a word, this match\r\nwas wedlock in its most terrible appearances. She, at last weary of\r\nrailing to no purpose, applies to a good uncle, who gives her a bottle\r\nof water. \"The virtue of this powerful liquor,\" said he, \"is such, that\r\nif the woman you marry proves a scold (which, it seems, my dear niece,\r\nis your misfortune, as it was your good mother's before you), let her\r\nhold six spoonfuls in her mouth, for a full half hour after you come\r\nhome--\" But I find I am not in humour for telling a tale, and nothing in\r\nnature is so ungrateful as story-telling against the grain, therefore\r\ntake it as the author has given it you.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe MEDECINE.\r\n\r\n#A Tale--for the Ladies.#\r\n\r\n    Miss Molly, a famed toast, was fair and young,\r\n    Had wealth and charms, but then she had a tongue\r\n    From morn to night, the eternal larum run,\r\n    Which often lost those hearts her eyes had won.\r\n\r\n    Sir John was smitten, and confessed his flame,\r\n    Sighed out the usual time, then wed the dame:\r\n    Possessed he thought of every joy of life,\r\n    But his dear Molly proved a very wife.\r\n    Excess of fondness did in time decline,\r\n    Madam loved money, and the knight loved wine.\r\n    From whence some petty discords would arise,\r\n    As, \"You're a fool\"; and, \"You are mighty wise!\"\r\n\r\n    Though he and all the world allowed her wit,\r\n    Her voice was shrill, and rather loud than sweet,\r\n    When she began,--for hat and sword he'd call.\r\n    Then, after a faint kiss, cry, \"B'y, dear Moll:\r\n    Supper and friends expect me at the Rose.\"[83]\r\n    And, \"What, Sir John, you'll get your usual dose!\r\n    Go, stink of smoke, and guzzle nasty wine,\r\n    Sure, never virtuous love was used like mine!\"\r\n\r\n    Oft as the watchful bellman marched his round,\r\n    At a fresh bottle gay Sir John he found.\r\n    By four the knight would get his business done,\r\n    And only then reeled off, because alone;\r\n    Full well he knew the dreadful storm to come,\r\n    But armed with bordeaux, he durst venture home.\r\n\r\n    My lady with her tongue was still prepared,\r\n    She rattled loud, and he impatient heard:\r\n    \"'Tis a fine hour? In a sweet pickle made!\r\n    And this, Sir John, is every day the trade.\r\n    Here I sit moping all the live-long night,\r\n    Devoured with spleen, and stranger to delight;\r\n    'Till morn sends staggering home a drunken beast,\r\n    Resolved to break my heart, as well as rest.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Hey!

Betty, 's your lady dead?\"\r\n    Madam, aside, an ample mouthful takes,\r\n    Curtsies, looks kind, but not a word she speaks:\r\n    Wondering, he stared, scarcely his eyes believed,\r\n    But found his ears agreeably deceived.\r\n    \"Why, how now, Molly, what's the crotchet now?\"\r\n    She smiles, and answers only with a bow.\r\n    Then clasping her about,--\"Why, let me die!\r\n    These nightclothes, Moll, become thee mightily!\"\r\n    With that, he sighed, her hand began to press,\r\n    And Betty calls, her lady to undress;\r\n    \"Nay, kiss me, Molly, for I'm much inclined.\"\r\n    Her lace she cuts, to take him in the mind.\r\n    Thus the fond pair to bed enamoured went,\r\n    The lady pleased, and the good knight content.\r\n\r\n    For many days these fond endearments passed,\r\n    The reconciling bottle fails at last;\r\n    'Twas used and gone: Then midnight storms arose,\r\n    And looks and words the union discompose.\r\n    Her coach is ordered, and post-haste she flies,\r\n    To beg her uncle for some fresh supplies;\r\n    Transported does the strange effects relate,\r\n    Her knight's conversion, and her happy state!\r\n\r\n    \"Why, niece,\" says he, \"I prithee apprehend\r\n    The water's water.

Our last\r\nadvices from Germany inform us, that the minister of Hanover has urged\r\nthe council at Ratisbon to exert themselves in behalf of the common\r\ncause, and taken the liberty to say, that the dignity, the virtue, the\r\nprudence of his electoral highness, his master, were called to the head\r\nof their affairs in vain, if they thought fit to leave him naked of the\r\nproper means to make those excellences useful for the honour and safety\r\nof the Empire. They write from Berlin of the 13th, O.S., that the true\r\ndesign of General Fleming's visit to that Court was, to insinuate, that\r\nit will be for the mutual interest of the King of Prussia and King\r\nAugustus to enter into a new alliance; but that the ministers of Prussia\r\nare not inclined to his sentiments. We hear from Vienna, that his\r\nImperial Majesty has expressed great satisfaction in their high\r\nmightinesses having communicated to him the whole that has passed in the\r\naffair of a peace. Though there have been practices used by the agents\r\nof France, in all the Courts of Europe, to break the good understanding\r\nof the allies, they have had no other effect, but to make all the\r\nmembers concerned in the alliance, more doubtful of their safety from\r\nthe great offers of the enemy. The Empire is roused by this alarm, and\r\nthe frontiers of all the French dominions are in danger of being\r\ninsulted the ensuing campaign: advices from all parts confirm, that it\r\nis impossible for France to find a way to obtain so much credit, as to\r\ngain any one potentate of the allies, or make any hope for safety from\r\nother prospects.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom my own Apartment, April 13.\r\n\r\nI find it of very great use, now I am setting up for a writer of news,\r\nthat I am an adept in astrological speculations; by which means, I avoid\r\nspeaking of things which may offend great persons. But at the same time,\r\nI must not prostitute the liberal sciences so far, as not to utter the\r\ntruth in cases which do not immediately concern the good of my native\r\ncountry. I must therefore boldly contradict what has been so assuredly\r\nreported by the news-writers of England, that France is in the most\r\ndeplorable condition, and that their people die in great multitudes. I\r\nwill therefore let the world know, that my correspondent, by the way of\r\nBrussels, informs me, upon his honour, that the gentleman who writes the\r\nGazette of Paris, and ought to know as well as any man, has told him,\r\nthat ever since the king has been past his 63rd year, or grand\r\nclimacteric, there has not one man died of the French nation who was\r\nyounger than his Majesty, except a very few, who were taken suddenly\r\nnear the village of Hochsted[84] in Germany; and some more, who were\r\nstraitened for lodging at a place called Ramilies, and died on the road\r\nto Ghent and Bruges. There are also other things given out by the\r\nallies, which are shifts below a conquering nation to make use of. Among\r\nothers, 'tis said, there is a general murmuring among the people of\r\nFrance, though at the same time all my letters agree, that there is so\r\ngood an understanding among them, that there is not one morsel carried\r\nout of any market in the kingdom, but what is delivered upon credit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 81: William Harrison (1685-1713) was a favourite with Swift\r\nand Addison. He wrote verses, and a continuation of the _Tatler_, and\r\nafterwards obtained office in the diplomatic service; but his health\r\nsoon broke down, and he died when 28.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 82: There is a similar story in Burton's \"Anatomy of\r\nMelancholy.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 83: The Rose Tavern, in Russell Street, adjoined Drury Lane\r\nTheatre, and was a favourite resort during and after the play.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 84: The Battle of Blenheim.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 3. [STEELE.\r\n\r\nFrom _Thursday, April 14_, to _Saturday, April 16_, 1709.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nWill's Coffee-house, April 14.\r\n\r\nThis evening, the comedy called \"The Country Wife\"[85] was acted in\r\nDrury Lane, for the benefit of Mrs. Bignell.[86] The part which gives\r\nname to the play was performed by herself. Through the whole action, she\r\nmade a very pretty figure, and exactly entered into the nature of the\r\npart. Her husband in the drama, is represented to be one of those\r\ndebauchees who run through the vices of the town, and believe when they\r\nthink fit they can marry, and settle at their ease. His own knowledge of\r\nthe iniquity of the age, makes him choose a wife wholly ignorant of it,\r\nand place his security in her want of skill how to abuse him. The poet,\r\non many occasions, where the propriety of the character will admit of\r\nit, insinuates, that there is no defence against vice, but the contempt\r\nof it: and has, in the natural ideas of an untainted innocent, shown the\r\ngradual steps to ruin and destruction, which persons of condition run\r\ninto, without the help of a good education how to form their conduct.\r\nThe torment of a jealous coxcomb, which arises from his own false\r\nmaxims, and the aggravation of his pain, by the very words in which he\r\nsees her innocence, makes a very pleasant and instructive satire. The\r\ncharacter of Horner, and the design of it, is a good representation of\r\nthe age in which that comedy was written; at which time love and\r\nwenching were the business of life, and the gallant manner of pursuing\r\nwomen was the best recommendation at Court. To which only it is to be\r\nimputed, that a gentleman of Mr. Wycherley's character and sense,\r\ncondescends to represent the insults done to the honour of the bed,\r\nwithout just reproof; but to have drawn a man of probity with regard to\r\nsuch considerations, had been a monster, and a poet had at that time\r\ndiscovered his want of knowing the manners of the Court he lived in, by\r\na virtuous character in his fine gentleman, as he would show his\r\nignorance, by drawing a vicious one to please the present audience. Mrs.\r\nBignell did her part very happily, and had a certain grace in her\r\nrusticity, which gave us hopes of seeing her a very skilful player, and\r\nin some parts, supply our loss of Mrs. Verbruggen.[87] I cannot be of\r\nthe same opinion with my friends and fellow-labourers, the Reformers of\r\nManners,[88] in their severity towards plays, but must allow that a good\r\nplay acted before a well-bred audience, must raise very proper\r\nincitements to good behaviour, and be the most quick and most prevailing\r\nmethod of giving young people a turn of sense and breeding. But as I\r\nhave set up for a weekly historian, I resolve to be a faithful one; and\r\ntherefore take this public occasion to admonish a young nobleman, who\r\ncame flustered into the box last night, and let him know, how much all\r\nhis friends were out of countenance for him. The women sat in terror of\r\nhearing something that should shock their modesty, and all the gentlemen\r\nin as much pain, out of compassion to the ladies, and perhaps resentment\r\nfor the indignity which was offered in coming into their presence in so\r\ndisrespectful a manner. Wine made him say nothing that was rude,\r\ntherefore he is forgiven, upon condition he will never hazard his\r\noffending more in this kind. As I just now hinted, I own myself of the\r\nSociety for Reformation of Manners. We have lower instruments than those\r\nof the family of Bickerstaff, for punishing great crimes, and exposing\r\nthe abandoned. Therefore, as I design to have notices from all public\r\nassemblies, I shall take upon me only indecorums, improprieties, and\r\nnegligences, in such as should give us better examples. After this\r\ndeclaration, if a fine lady thinks fit to giggle at church, or a great\r\nbeau come in drunk to a play, either shall be sure to hear of it in my\r\nensuing paper: for merely as a well-bred man, I cannot bear these\r\nenormities.\r\n\r\nAfter the play, we naturally stroll to this coffee-house, in hopes of\r\nmeeting some new poem, or other entertainment, among the men of wit and\r\npleasure, where there is a dearth at present. But it is wonderful there\r\nshould be so few writers, when the art is become merely mechanic, and\r\nmen may make themselves great that way, by as certain and infallible\r\nrules, as you may be a joiner or a mason. There happens a good instance\r\nof this, in what the hawker just now has offered to sale; to wit,\r\n\"Instructions to Vanderbank; a Sequel to the Advice to the Poets: A\r\nPoem, occasioned by the Glorious Success of her Majesty's Arms, under\r\nthe Command of the Duke of Marlborough, the last Year in Flanders.\"[89]\r\nHere you are to understand, that the author finding the poets would not\r\ntake his advice, he troubles himself no more about them; but has met\r\nwith one Vanderbank,[90] who works in arras, and makes very good\r\ntapestry hangings. Therefore, in order to celebrate the hero of the age,\r\nhe claps me together all that can be said of a man that makes hangings, as:\r\n\r\n    _Then, artist, who dost Nature's face express\r\n    In silk and gold, and scenes of action dress;\r\n    Dost figured arras animated leave,\r\n    Spin a bright story, or a passion weave\r\n    By mingling threads; canst mingle shade and light,\r\n    Delineate triumphs, or describe a fight._\r\n\r\nWell, what shall this workman do? Why, to show how great an hero the\r\npoet intends, he provides him a very good horse:\r\n\r\n    _Champing his foam, and bounding on the plain,\r\n    Arch his high neck, and graceful spread his mane._\r\n\r\nNow as to the intrepidity, the calm courage, the constant application of\r\nthe hero, it is not necessary to take that upon yourself; you may, in\r\nthe lump, bid him you employ raise him as high as he can, and if he does\r\nit not, let him answer for disobeying orders:\r\n\r\n    _Let fame and victory in inferior sky,\r\n    Hover with ballanced wings, and smiling fly\r\n    Above his head, &c._\r\n\r\nA whole poem of this kind may be ready against an ensuing campaign, as\r\nwell as a space left in the canvas of a piece of tapestry for the\r\nprincipal figure, while the underparts are working: so that in effect,\r\nthe adviser copies after the man he pretends to direct. This method\r\nshould, methinks, encourage young beginners: for the invention is so\r\nfitted to all capacities, that by the help of it a man may make a\r\nreceipt for a poem. A young man may observe, that the jig[91] of the\r\nthing is, as I said, finding out all that can be said of his way [whom]\r\nyou employ to set forth your worthy. Waller and Denham had worn out the\r\nexpedient of \"Advice to a Painter.\"[92] This author has transferred the\r\nwork, and sent his advice to the Poets; that is to say, to the turners\r\nof verse, as he calls them. Well, that thought is worn out also,\r\ntherefore he directs his genius to the loom, and will have a new set of\r\nhangings in honour of the last year in Flanders. I must own to you, I\r\napprove extremely this invention, and it might be improved for the\r\nbenefit of manufactory: as, suppose an ingenious gentleman should write\r\na poem of advice to a calico-printer: do you think there is a girl in\r\nEngland, that would wear anything but the taking of Lille, or the Battle\r\nof Oudenarde? They would certainly be all the fashion, till the heroes\r\nabroad had cut out some more patterns. I should fancy small skirmishes\r\nmight do for under-petticoats, provided they had a siege for the upper.\r\nIf our adviser were well imitated, many industrious people might be put\r\nto work. Little Mr. Dactile, now in the room, who formerly writ a song\r\nand a half, is a week gone in a very pretty work upon this hint: he is\r\nwriting an epigram to a young virgin who knits very well ('tis a\r\nthousand pities he is a Jacobite); but his epigram is by way of advice\r\nto this damsel, to knit all the actions of the Pretender and the Duke of\r\nBurgundy last campaign in the clock of a stocking. It were endless to\r\nenumerate the many hands and trades that may be employed by poets, of so\r\nuseful a turn as this adviser's. I shall think of it; and in this time\r\nof taxes, shall consult a great critic employed in the custom-house, in\r\norder to propose what tax may be proper to put upon knives, seals,\r\nrings, hangings, wrought-beds, gowns and petticoats, where any of those\r\ncommodities bear mottoes, or are worked upon poetical grounds.\r\n\r\n\r\nSt. James's Coffee-house, April 15.\r\n\r\nLetters from Turin of the 3rd instant, N.S., inform us, that his Royal\r\nHighness employs all his address in alarming the enemy, and perplexing\r\ntheir speculations concerning his real designs the ensuing campaign.\r\nContracts are entered into with the merchants of Milan, for a great\r\nnumber of mules to transport his provisions and ammunition. His Royal\r\nHighness has ordered the train of artillery to be conveyed to Susa\r\nbefore the 20th of the next month. In the meantime, all accounts agree,\r\nthat the enemy are very backward in their preparations, and almost\r\nincapable of defending themselves against an invasion, by reason of the\r\ngeneral murmurs of their own people; which, they find, are no way to be\r\nquieted, but by giving them hopes of a speedy peace. When these letters\r\nwere dispatched, the Marshal de Thesse was arrived at Genoa, where he\r\nhas taken much pains to keep the correspondents of the merchants of\r\nFrance in hopes, that measures will be found out to support the credit\r\nand commerce between that state and Lyons. But the late declaration of\r\nthe agents of Monsieur Bernard, that they cannot discharge the demands\r\nmade upon them, has quite dispirited all those who are engaged in the\r\nremittances of France.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom my own Apartment, April 15.\r\n\r\nIt is a very natural passion in all good members of the commonwealth, to\r\ntake what care they can of their families. Therefore I hope the reader\r\nwill forgive me, that I desire he would go to the play, called the\r\n\"Stratagem,\"[93] this evening, which is to be acted for the benefit of\r\nmy near kinsman, Mr. John Bickerstaff.[94] I protest to you the\r\ngentleman has not spoken to me to desire this favour; but I have a\r\nrespect for him, as well in regard to consanguinity, as that he is an\r\nintimate friend of that famous and heroic actor, Mr. George Powell, who\r\nformerly played Alexander the Great in all places, though he is lately\r\ngrown so reserved as to act it only on the stage.[95]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 85: By Wycherley, first acted in 1683.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 86: Mrs. Bicknell (or Bignell) was born about 1695. It is not\r\nclear whether she was married, or whether the name Bicknell was taken to\r\ndistinguish her from her sister, Mrs. Young, who was also an actress. We\r\nfirst hear of her acting in 1706; she took parts in which sauciness and\r\ncoquetry were the chief features. Her last recorded appearance was on\r\nthe 2nd of April, 1723; and she died in May. She signed a petition \"M.\r\nBicknell\"; probably her name was Margaret, her mother's name. Steele\r\nalludes to her as \"pretty Mrs. Bignell\" in No. 11, and as his friend in\r\nthe _Guardian_, No. 50. She was Miss Prue in Congreve's \"Love for Love,\"\r\nand Miss Hoyden in Vanbrugh's \"Relapse.\" In the _Spectator_ (No. 370)\r\nSteele praises her dancing.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 87: Cibber writes thus of this actress: \"Mrs. Mountford, whose\r\nsecond marriage gave her the name of Verbruggen, was mistress of more\r\nvariety of humour than I ever knew in any one woman actress. This\r\nvariety, too, was attended with an equal vivacity, which made her\r\nexcellent in characters extremely different.... She was so fond of\r\nhumour, in what low part soever to be found, that she would make no\r\nscruple of defacing her fair form to come heartily into it.\" She could\r\nact admirably as a Devonshire lass, a pretty fellow, or a fine lady.\r\nMrs. Verbruggen's first husband, the actor Mountford, was killed by\r\nCaptain Hill, with the assistance of Lord Mohun, in 1692, because Hill,\r\nwho was making unsuccessful suit to Mrs. Bracegirdle was jealous of her\r\nfellow-actor. Mountford was then in his thirty-third year. Mrs.\r\nMountford's second husband, John Verbruggen, is described by Tony Aston\r\nas \"nature without extravagance.\" ... \"That rough diamond shone more\r\nbright than all the artful polished brilliants that ever sparkled on our\r\nstage.\" The same writer says of Mrs. Verbruggen: \"She was all art, but\r\ndressed so nice, it looked like nature. She was the most easy actress in\r\nthe world. Her maiden name was Percival.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 88: Various Societies for the Reformation of Manners were\r\nfounded in the reign of William III. An \"Account\" of these societies was\r\npublished in 1699, and Defoe often wrote on the subject. In 1708 the\r\nSociety for London and Westminster secured the conviction of 3299 \"lewd\r\nand scandalous\" persons, guilty of Sunday trading swearing, drunkenness,\r\n&c.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 89: See Steele's apology to Blackmore, author of this poem, in\r\nNo. 14. Sir Richard Blackmore (died 1729) was a Whig physician who wrote\r\nepics on religious and other subjects, and was often at loggerheads with\r\nthe actors and wits. Though he was not a poet, Addison and Steele\r\npraised him on account of the religious tone of his work (see\r\n_Spectator_, Nos. 6, 339).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 90: Vanderbank, or as his father sometimes wrote his name,\r\nVandrebanc, was a son of Peter Vanderbank, a Parisian, who came into\r\nEngland with Gascar the painter, about 1674, and died at Bradfield, in\r\nHertfordshire, in 1697. His father was admired for the softness of his\r\nprints, and still more for the size of them, some of his heads being the\r\nlargest that had then appeared in England; but the prices he received by\r\nno means compensated for the time employed on his works, and he was\r\nreduced to want, and died at the house of Mr. Forester, his\r\nbrother-in-law. After his death, his widow sold his plates to one Brown,\r\na print-seller, who made a great profit by them. His eldest son had some\r\nshare in the theatre at Dublin; the youngest, William, was a poor\r\nlabourer, who gave an account of his father and the family to Vertue.\r\nThe person mentioned in this paper was probably his father's name-son,\r\nand might be, as Walpole conjectures, an engraver. Whatever concern the\r\nfather might have had in any manufacture of tapestry, he could not be\r\nthe person meant here, for at this time he had been dead above ten\r\nyears. The suite of tapestry, in the Duke of Ancaster's sale, with\r\nVanderbank's name to it, mentioned by Walpole, must therefore be\r\nsupposed to belong to the son, who is said, upon the authority of the\r\nFrench translator of the _Tatler_, to have represented nature very\r\nhappily in works of tapestry, and to have been a man inimitable in this\r\nway.

He died in 1714. Addison praised his acting of tragic parts in\r\nNo. 40 of the _Spectator_. See also No. 31. An order to the comedians in\r\nDorset Gardens forbade them acting till further order, because they had\r\nallowed Powell to play after he was committed for drawing his sword on\r\nColonel Stanhope and Mr. Davenant. This is dated May 3, 10 Will. III.\r\n(1698); but on May 4 there was another order for the comedians to resume\r\nacting.

[STEELE.\r\n\r\nFrom _Saturday April 16_, to _Tuesday, April 19, 1709_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is usual with persons who mount the stage for the cure or information\r\nof the crowd about them, to make solemn professions of their being\r\nwholly disinterested in the pains they take for the public good. At the\r\nsame time, those very men, who make harangues in plush doublets, and\r\nextol their own abilities and generous inclinations, tear their lungs in\r\nvending a drug, and show no act of bounty, except it be, that they lower\r\na demand of a crown, to six, nay, to one penny. We have a contempt for\r\nsuch paltry barterers, and have therefore all along informed the public\r\nthat we intend to give them our advices for our own sakes, and are\r\nlabouring to make our lucubrations come to some price in money, for our\r\nmore convenient support in the service of the public. It is certain,\r\nthat many other schemes have been proposed to me; as a friend offered to\r\nshow me a treatise he had writ, which he called \"The Whole Art of Life,\r\nor the Introduction to Great Men, illustrated in a Pack of Cards.\" But\r\nbeing a novice at all manner of play I declined the offer. Another\r\nadvised me, for want of money, to set up my coach and practise physic,\r\nbut having been bred a scholar, I feared I should not succeed that way\r\nneither; therefore resolved to go on in my present project. But you are\r\nto understand, that I shall not pretend to raise a credit to this work,\r\nupon the weight of my politic news only, but, as my Latin sentence in\r\nthe title-page informs you, shall take anything that offers for the\r\nsubject of my discourse. Thus, new persons, as well as new things, are\r\nto come under my consideration; as, when a toast, or a wit, is first\r\npronounced such, you shall have the freshest advice of their preferment\r\nfrom me, with a description of the beauty's manner, and the wit's style;\r\nas also, in whose places they are advanced. For this town is never\r\ngood-natured enough to raise one, without depressing another. But it is\r\nmy design, to avoid saying anything, of any person, which ought justly\r\nto displease; but shall endeavour, by the variety of the matter and\r\nstyle, to give entertainment for men of pleasure, without offence to\r\nthose of business.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhite's Chocolate-house, April 18.\r\n\r\nAll hearts at present pant for two ladies only[96], who have for some\r\ntime engrossed the dominion of the town. They are indeed both exceeding\r\ncharming, but differ very much in their excellences. The beauty of\r\nClarissa is soft, that of Chloe piercing. When you look at Clarissa,\r\nyou see the most exact harmony of feature, complexion, and shape; you\r\nfind in Chloe nothing extraordinary in any one of those particulars, but\r\nthe whole woman irresistible. Clarissa looks languishing; Chloe,\r\nkilling. Clarissa never fails of gaining admiration; Chloe, of moving\r\ndesire. The gazers at Clarissa are at first unconcerned, as if they were\r\nobserving a fine picture. They who behold Chloe, at the first glance,\r\ndiscover transport, as if they met their dearest friend. These different\r\nperfections are suitably represented by the last great painter Italy has\r\nsent us, Mr. Jervas.[97] Clarissa is, by that skilful hand, placed in a\r\nmanner that looks artless, and innocent of the torments she gives; Chloe\r\ndrawn with a liveliness that shows she is conscious, but not affected,\r\nof her perfections. Clarissa is a shepherdess; Chloe, a country girl. I\r\nmust own, the design of Chloe's picture shows, to me, great mastery in\r\nthe painter; for nothing could be better imagined than the dress he has\r\ngiven her, of a straw hat and riband, to represent that sort of beauty\r\nwhich enters the heart with a certain familiarity, and cheats it into a\r\nbelief, that it has received a lover as well as an object of love. The\r\nforce of their different beauties is seen also in the effects it makes\r\non their lovers. The admirers of Chloe are eternally gay and\r\nwell-pleased: those of Clarissa, melancholy and thoughtful. And as this\r\npassion always changes the natural man into a quite different creature\r\nfrom what he was before, the love of Chloe makes coxcombs; that of\r\nClarissa, madmen. There were of each kind just now here. Here was one\r\nthat whistles, laughs, sings, and cuts capers, for love of Chloe.\r\nAnother has just now written three lines to Clarissa, then taken a turn\r\nin the garden, then came back again, then tore his fragment, then called\r\nfor some chocolate, then went away without it.\r\n\r\nChloe has so many admirers in the room at present, that there is too\r\nmuch noise to proceed in my narration, so that the progress of the loves\r\nof Clarissa and Chloe, together with the bottles that are drank each\r\nnight for the one, and the many sighs which are uttered, and songs\r\nwritten, on the other, must be our subject on future occasions.\r\n\r\n\r\nWill's Coffee-house, April 18.\r\n\r\nLetters from the Haymarket inform us, that on Saturday night last the\r\nopera of \"Pyrrhus and Demetrius\"[98] was performed with great applause.\r\nThis intelligence is not very acceptable to us friends of the theatre;\r\nfor the stage being an entertainment of the reason and all our\r\nfaculties, this way of being pleased with the suspense of them for three\r\nhours together, and being given up to the shallow satisfaction of the\r\neyes and ears only, seems to arise rather from the degeneracy of our\r\nunderstanding, than an improvement of our diversions.[99] That the\r\nunderstanding has no part in the pleasure is evident, from what these\r\nletters very positively assert, to wit, that a great part of the\r\nperformance was done in Italian: and a great critic fell into fits in\r\nthe gallery, at feeling, not only time and place, but languages and\r\nnations confused in the most incorrigible manner. His spleen is so\r\nextremely moved on this occasion, that he is going to publish a treatise\r\nagainst operas, which, he thinks, have already inclined us to thoughts\r\nof peace, and if tolerated, must infallibly dispirit us from carrying on\r\nthe war. He has communicated his scheme to the whole room, and declared\r\nin what manner things of this kind were first introduced. He has upon\r\nthis occasion considered the nature of sounds in general, and made a\r\nvery elaborate digression upon the London cries,[100] wherein he has\r\nshown from reason and philosophy why oysters are cried,\r\ncard-matches[101] sung, and turnips and all other vegetables neither\r\ncried, sung, nor said, but sold, with an accent and tone neither natural\r\nto man or beast. This piece seems to be taken from the model of that\r\nexcellent discourse of Mrs. Manly the schoolmistress, concerning\r\nsamplers.[102] Advices from the upper end of Piccadilly say that Mayfair\r\nis utterly abolished;[103] and we hear Mr. Pinkethman[104] has removed\r\nhis ingenious company of strollers to Greenwich: but other letters from\r\nDeptford say, the company is only making thither, and not yet settled;\r\nbut that several heathen gods and goddesses, which are to descend in\r\nmachines, landed at the King's Head Stairs last Saturday. Venus and\r\nCupid went on foot from thence to Greenwich; Mars got drunk in the town,\r\nand broke his landlord's head; for which he sat in the stocks the whole\r\nevening; but Mr. Pinkethman giving security that he should do nothing\r\nthis ensuing summer, he was set at liberty. The most melancholy part of\r\nall, was, that Diana was taken in the act of fornication with a boatman,\r\nand committed by Justice Wrathful, which has, it seems, put a stop to\r\nthe diversions of the theatre of Blackheath. But there goes down another\r\nDiana and a patient Grissel next tide from Billingsgate.[105]\r\n\r\n\r\nSt. James's Coffee-house, April 18.\r\n\r\nThey write from Saxony of the 13th instant, N.S., that the Grand General\r\nof the Crown of Poland was so far from entering into a treaty with King\r\nStanislaus, that he had written circular letters, wherein he exhorted\r\nthe Palatinates to join against him; declaring, that this was the most\r\nfavourable conjuncture for asserting their liberty.\r\n\r\nLetters from the Hague of the 23rd instant, N.S., say, they have advices\r\nfrom Vienna, which import, that his Electoral Highness of Hanover had\r\nsignified to the Imperial Court, that he did not intend to put himself\r\nat the head of the troops of the Empire, except more effectual measures\r\nwere taken for acting vigorously against the enemy the ensuing campaign.\r\nUpon this representation, the Emperor has given orders to several\r\nregiments to march towards the Rhine, and despatched expresses to the\r\nrespective princes of the Empire to desire an augmentation of their\r\nforces.\r\n\r\nThese letters add, that an express arrived at the Hague on the 20th\r\ninstant, with advice, that the enemy having made a detachment from\r\nTournay of 1500 horse, each trooper carrying a foot-soldier behind him,\r\nin order to surprise the garrison of Alost; the allies, upon notice of\r\ntheir march, sent out a strong body of troops from Ghent, which engaged\r\nthe enemy at Asche, and took 200 of them prisoners, obliging the rest to\r\nretire without making any further attempt. On the 22nd in the morning a\r\nfleet of merchant ships coming from Scotland, were attacked by six\r\nFrench privateers at the entrance of the Meuse. We have yet no certain\r\nadvice of the event: but letters from Rotterdam say, that a Dutch\r\nman-of-war of forty guns, which was convoy to the said fleet, was taken,\r\nas were also eighteen of the merchants. The Swiss troops, in the\r\nservice of the States, have completed the augmentation of their\r\nrespective companies. Those of Wirtemberg and Prussia are expected on\r\nthe frontiers within few days; and the auxiliaries from Saxony, as also\r\na battalion of Holstein, and another of Wolfembuttel, are advancing\r\nthither with all expedition. On the 21st instant, the deputies of the\r\nStates had a conference near Woerden with the President Rouillé, but the\r\nmatter which was therein debated is not made public. His Grace the Duke\r\nof Marlborough and Prince Eugene continue at the Hague.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom my own Apartment, April 18.\r\n\r\nI have lately been very studious for intelligence, and have just now, by\r\nmy astrological flying-post, received a packet from Felicia,[106] an\r\nisland in America, with an account that gives me great satisfaction, and\r\nlets me understand that the island was never in greater prosperity, or\r\nthe administration in so good hands, since the death of their late\r\nvaliant king. These letters import, that the chief minister has entered\r\ninto a firm league with the ablest and best men of the nation, to carry\r\non the cause of liberty, to the encouragement of religion, virtue, and\r\nhonour. Those persons at the helm are so useful, and in themselves of\r\nsuch weight, that their strict alliance must needs tend to the universal\r\nprosperity of the people. Camillo,[107] it seems, presides over the\r\ndeliberations of state; and is so highly valued by all men, for his\r\nsingular probity, courage, affability, and love of mankind, that his\r\nbeing placed in that station has dissipated the fears of that people,\r\nwho of all the world are the most jealous of their liberty and\r\nhappiness. The next member of their society is Horatio,[108] who makes\r\nall the public despatches. This minister is master of all the languages\r\nin use to great perfection: he is held in the highest veneration\r\nimaginable for a severe honesty, and love of his country: he lives in a\r\ncourt, unsullied with any of its artifices, the refuge of the oppressed,\r\nand terror of oppressors. Martio[109] has joined himself to this\r\ncouncil; a man of most undaunted resolution and great knowledge in\r\nmaritime affairs; famous for destroying the navy of the Franks,[110] and\r\nsingularly happy in one particular, that he never preferred a man who\r\nhas not proved remarkably serviceable to his country. Philander[111] is\r\nmentioned with particular distinction; a nobleman who has the most\r\nrefined taste of the true pleasures and elegance of life, joined to an\r\nindefatigable industry in business; a man eloquent in assemblies,\r\nagreeable in conversation, and dextrous in all manner of public\r\nnegotiations. These letters add, that Verono,[112] who is also of this\r\ncouncil, has lately set sail to his government of Patricia, with design\r\nto confirm the affections of the people in the interests of his queen.\r\nThis minister is master of great abilities, and is as industrious and\r\nrestless for the preservation of the liberties of the people, as the\r\ngreatest enemy can be to subvert them. The influence of these\r\npersonages, who are men of such distinguished parts and virtues, makes\r\nthe people enjoy the utmost tranquillity in the midst of a war, and\r\ngives them undoubted hopes of a secure peace from their vigilance and\r\nintegrity.[113]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 96: In a copy of the original edition of the _Tatler_, with\r\nMS. notes written early in the last century, which was sold at Messrs.\r\nSotheby's, in April, 1887, the ladies here described were said to be\r\nMrs. Chetwine and Mrs. Hales respectively. Mrs. Hales was a maid of\r\nhonour who married Mr. Coke, vice-chamberlain, in July, 1709 (Luttrell's\r\n\"Brief Relation,\" vi. 462); \"Mrs. Chetwine\" was probably the wife of\r\nWilliam Richard Chetwynd, afterwards third Viscount Chetwynd, who\r\nmarried Honora, daughter of John Baker, Consul at Algiers; or the wife\r\nof his brother Walter, M.P. for Stafford, and Master of the Buckhounds.\r\nIn 1717, Lady M. W. Montagu, describing a week spent by a fashionable\r\nlady, said, 'Friday, Mrs. Chetwynd's, &c.; a perpetual round of hearing\r\nthe same scandal' (Pope's Works, ix. 385).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 97: Charles Jervas, portrait painter (died 1739), became\r\nprincipal painter to George I. and George II.

[STEELE.\r\n\r\nFrom _Tuesday, April 19_, to _Thursday, April 21_, 1709.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nWhite's Chocolate-house, April 20.\r\n\r\n    _Who names that lost thing, love, without a tear,\r\n    Since so debauched by ill-bred customs here,\r\n    To an exact perfection they have brought\r\n    The action, love, the passion is forgot._\r\n\r\nThis was long ago a witty author's lamentation, but the evil still\r\ncontinues; and if a man of any delicacy were to attend the discourses of\r\nthe young fellows of this age, they would believe there were none but\r\nprostitutes to make the objects of passion. So true it is what the\r\nauthor of the above verses said, a little before his death, of the\r\nmodern pretenders to gallantry: \"They set up for wits in this age, by\r\nsaying when they are sober, what they of the last spoke only when they\r\nwere drunk.\" But Cupid is not only blind at present, but dead-drunk, he\r\nhas lost all his faculties: else how should Celia be so long a maid with\r\nthat agreeable behaviour? Corinna, with that uprightly wit? Lesbia, with\r\nthat heavenly voice? And Sacharissa, with all those excellences in one\r\nperson, frequent the park, the play, and murder the poor tits that drag\r\nher to public places, and not a man turn pale at her appearance? But\r\nsuch is the fallen state of love, that if it were not for honest\r\nCynthio,[114] who is true to the cause, we should hardly have a pattern\r\nleft of the ancient worthies that way: and indeed he has but very little\r\nencouragement to persevere; but he has a devotion, rather than love, for\r\nhis mistress; and says,\r\n\r\n    Only tell her that I love,\r\n      Leave the rest to her, and Fate;\r\n    Some kind planet from above,\r\n    May, perhaps, her passsion move:\r\n      Lovers on their stars must wait.[115]\r\n\r\nBut the stars I am so intimately acquainted with, that I can assure him,\r\nhe will never have her: for would you believe it, though Cynthio has\r\nwit, good sense, fortune, and his very being depends on her, the\r\ntermagant for whom he sighs, is in love with a fellow, who stares in the\r\nglass all the time he is with her, and lets her plainly see, she may\r\npossibly be his rival, but never his mistress. Yet Cynthio, the same\r\nunhappy man whom I mentioned in my first narrative, pleases himself with\r\na vain imagination, that with the language of his eyes, now he has found\r\nwho she is, he shall conquer her, though her eyes are intent upon one\r\nwho looks from her; which is ordinary with the sex. It is certainly a\r\nmistake in the ancients, to draw the little gentleman, Love, as a blind\r\nboy; for his real character is, a little thief that squints. For ask\r\nMrs. Meddle, who is a confidante, or spy, upon all the passions in town,\r\nand she will tell you, that the whole is a game of cross purposes. The\r\nlover is generally pursuing one who is in pursuit of another, and\r\nrunning from one that desires to meet him. Nay, the figure of this\r\npassion is so justly represented in a squinting little thief (who is\r\nalways in a double action) that do but observe Clarissa next time you\r\nsee her, and you'll find, when her eyes have made their tour round the\r\ncompany, she makes no stay on him they say she is to marry, but rests\r\ntwo seconds of a minute on Wildair, who neither looks nor thinks on her,\r\nor any woman else. However, Cynthio had a bow from her the other day,\r\nupon which he is very much come to himself; and I heard him send his man\r\nof an errand yesterday without any manner of hesitation; a quarter of an\r\nhour after which he reckoned twenty, remembered he was to sup with a\r\nfriend, and went exactly to his appointment. I sent to know how he did\r\nthis morning, and I find he very perfectly remembers that he spoke to me\r\nyesterday.\r\n\r\n\r\nWill's Coffee-house, April 20.\r\n\r\nThis week[116] being sacred to holy things, and no public diversions\r\nallowed, there has been taken notice of, even here, a little treatise,\r\ncalled, \"A Project for the Advancement of Religion; dedicated to the\r\nCountess of Berkeley.\"[117] The title was so uncommon, and promised so\r\npeculiar a way of thinking, that every man here has read it, and as\r\nmany as have done so, have approved it. It is written with the spirit of\r\none, who has seen the world enough to undervalue it with good breeding.\r\nThe author must certainly be a man of wisdom, as well as piety, and have\r\nspent much time in the exercise of both. The real causes of the decay of\r\nthe interest of religion, are set forth in a clear and lively manner,\r\nwithout unseasonable passions; and the whole air of the book, as to the\r\nlanguage, the sentiments, and the reasonings, show it was written by one\r\nwhose virtue sits easy about him, and to whom vice is thoroughly\r\ncontemptible. It was said by one of this company,[118] alluding to the\r\nknowledge the author seems to have of the world, \"The man writes much\r\nlike a gentleman, and goes to heaven with a very good mien.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSt. James's Coffee-house, April 20.\r\n\r\nLetters from Italy say, that the Marquis de Prie, upon the receipt of an\r\nexpress from the Court of Vienna, went immediately to the palace of\r\nCardinal Paulucci, minister of state to his Holiness, and demanded in\r\nthe name of his Imperial Majesty, that King Charles should be forthwith\r\nacknowledged king of Spain, by a solemn act of the congregation of\r\ncardinals appointed for that purpose: he declared at the same time, that\r\nif the least hesitation were made in this most important article of the\r\nlate treaty, he should not only be obliged to leave Rome himself, but\r\nalso transmit his master's orders to the imperial troops to face about,\r\nand return into the ecclesiastical dominions. When the cardinal reported\r\nthis message to the Pope, he was struck with so sensible an affliction,\r\nthat he burst into tears. His sorrow was aggravated by letters which\r\nimmediately after arrived from the Court of Madrid, wherein his Nuncio\r\nacquainted his Holiness, that upon the news of his accommodation with\r\nthe Emperor, he had received a message to forbear coming to Court; and\r\nthe people were so highly provoked, that they could hardly be restrained\r\nfrom insulting his palace. These letters add, that the King of Denmark\r\nwas gone from Florence to Pisa, and from Pisa to Leghorn, where the\r\ngovernor paid his Majesty all imaginable honours. The king designed to\r\ngo from thence to Lucca, where a magnificent tournament was prepared for\r\nhis diversion. An English man-of-war, which came from Port Mahon to\r\nLeghorn in six days, brought advice, that the fleet commanded by Admiral\r\nWhitaker, was safely arrived at Barcelona, with the troops and\r\nammunition which he had taken in at Naples.\r\n\r\nGeneral Boneval, Governor of Commacchio, had summoned the magistrates of\r\nall the towns near that place to appear before him, and take an oath of\r\nfidelity to his Imperial Majesty, commanding also the gentry to pay him\r\nhomage, on pain of death and confiscation of goods. Advices from\r\nSwitzerland inform us, that the bankers of Geneva were utterly ruined by\r\nthe failure of Mr. Bernard. They add, that the deputies of the Swiss\r\nCantons were returned from Solleure, where they were assembled at the\r\ninstance of the French Ambassador; but were very much dissatisfied with\r\nthe reception they had from that minister. 'Tis true, he omitted no\r\ncivilities, or expressions of friendship from his master, but he took no\r\nnotice of their pensions and arrears; what further provoked their\r\nindignation, was, that instead of twenty-five pistoles formerly allowed\r\nto each member, for their charge in coming to the Diet, he had\r\npresented them with six only. They write from Dresden, that King\r\nAugustus was still busy in recruiting his cavalry, and that the Danish\r\ntroops, which lately served in Hungary, had orders to be in Saxony in\r\nthe middle of May, and that his Majesty of Denmark was expected at\r\nDresden in the beginning of that month. King Augustus makes great\r\npreparations for his reception, and has appointed sixty coaches, each\r\ndrawn by six horses for that purpose: the interview of these princes\r\naffords great matter for speculation. Letters from Paris of the 22nd of\r\nthis month say, that Mareschal Harcourt and the Duke of Berwick were\r\npreparing to go into Alsace and Dauphine, but that their troops were in\r\nwant of all manner of necessaries. The Court of France had received\r\nadvices from Madrid, that on the 7th of this month, the States of Spain\r\nhad with much magnificence acknowledged the Prince of Asturias\r\npresumptive heir of the crown. This was performed at Buen Retiro; the\r\ndeputies took the oaths on that occasion by the hands of Cardinal\r\nPortocarrero. Those advices add, that it was signified to the Pope's\r\nNuncio, by order of council, to depart from that Court in twenty-four\r\nhours, and that a guard was accordingly appointed to conduct him to\r\nBayonne.\r\n\r\nLetters from the Hague of the 26th instant inform us, that Prince Eugene\r\nwas to set out the next day for Brussels, to put all things in a\r\nreadiness for opening the campaign. They add, that the Grand Pensioner\r\nhaving reported to the Duke of Marlborough what passed in the last\r\nconference with Mr. Rouillé,[119] his Grace had taken a resolution\r\nimmediately to return to Great Britain, to communicate to her Majesty\r\nall that has been transacted in that important affair.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom my own Apartment, April 20.\r\n\r\nThe nature of my miscellaneous work is such, that I shall always take\r\nthe liberty to tell for news such things (let them have happened never\r\nso much before the time of writing) as have escaped public notice, or\r\nhave been misrepresented to the world, provided that I am still within\r\nrules, and trespass not as a Tatler any further than in an incorrectness\r\nof style, and writing in an air of common speech. Thus if anything that\r\nis said, even of old Anchises or Æneas, be set by me in a different\r\nlight than has hitherto been hit upon, in order to inspire the love and\r\nadmiration of worthy actions, you will, gentle reader, I hope, accept of\r\nit for intelligence you had not before. But I am going upon a narrative,\r\nthe matter of which I know to be true: it is not only doing justice to\r\nthe deceased merit[120] of such persons, as, had they lived, would not\r\nhave had it in their power to thank me, but also an instance of the\r\ngreatness of spirit in the lowest of her Majesty's subjects; take it as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nAt the siege of Namur by the Allies, there were in the ranks of the\r\ncompany commanded by Captain Pincent, in Colonel Frederick Hamilton's\r\nregiment, one Unnion a corporal, and one Valentine a private sentinel:\r\nthere happened between these two men a dispute about a matter of love,\r\nwhich, upon some aggravations, grew to an irreconcilable hatred. Unnion\r\nbeing the officer of Valentine, took all opportunities even to strike\r\nhis rival, and profess the spite and revenge which moved him to it. The\r\nsentinel bore it without resistance, but frequently said he would die to\r\nbe revenged of that tyrant. They had spent whole months thus, one\r\ninjuring, the other complaining; when in the midst of this rage towards\r\neach other, they were commanded upon the attack of the castle, where the\r\ncorporal received a shot in the thigh, and fell; the French pressing on,\r\nand he expecting to be trampled to death, called out to his enemy, \"Ah,\r\nValentine! Can you leave me here?\" Valentine immediately ran back, and\r\nin the midst of a thick fire of the French, took the corporal upon his\r\nback, and brought him through all that danger as far as the Abbey of\r\nSalsine, where a cannon-ball took off his head: his body fell under his\r\nenemy whom he was carrying off Unnion immediately forgot his wound, rose\r\nup, tearing his hair, and then threw himself upon the bleeding carcass,\r\ncrying, \"Ah, Valentine! Was it for me, who have so barbarously used\r\nthee, that thou hast died? I will not Jive after thee.\" He was not by\r\nany means to be forced from the body, but was removed with it bleeding\r\nin his arms, and attended with tears by all their comrades, who knew\r\ntheir enmity. When he was brought to a tent, his wounds were dressed by\r\nforce; but the next day, still calling upon Valentine, and lamenting his\r\ncruelties to him, he died in the pangs of remorse and despair.\r\n\r\nIt may be a question among men of noble sentiments, whether of these\r\nunfortunate persons had the greater soul; he that was so generous as to\r\nventure his life for his enemy, or he who could not survive the man that\r\ndied, in laying upon him such an obligation?\r\n\r\nWhen we see spirits like these in a people, to what heights may we not\r\nsuppose their glory may arise, but (as it is excellently observed by\r\nSallust[121]) it is not only to the general bent of a nation that great\r\nrevolutions are owing, but to the extraordinary genios[122] that lead\r\nthem. On which occasion he proceeds to say that the Roman greatness was\r\nneither to be attributed to their superior policy, for in that the\r\nCarthaginians excelled; nor to their valour, for in that the French were\r\npreferable; but to particular men, who were born for the good of their\r\ncountry, and formed for great attempts. This he says, to introduce the\r\ncharacters of Cassar and Cato. It would be entering into too weighty a\r\ndiscourse for this place, if I attempted to show that our nation has\r\nproduced as great and able men for public affairs, as any other. But I\r\nbelieve the reader outruns me, and fixes his imagination upon the Duke\r\nof Marlborough. It is, methinks, a pleasing reflection, to consider the\r\ndispensations of Providence in the fortune of this illustrious man, who,\r\nin the space of forty years, has passed through all the gradations of\r\nhuman life, till he has ascended to the character of a prince, and\r\nbecome the scourge of a tyrant, who sat in one of the greatest thrones\r\nof Europe, before the man who was to have the greatest part in his\r\ndownfall had made one step in the world.[123] But such elevations are\r\nthe natural consequences of an exact prudence, a calm courage, a\r\nwell-governed temper, a patient ambition, and an affable behaviour.\r\nThese arts, as they are the steps to his greatness, so they are the\r\npillars of it now it is raised. To this her glorious son, Great Britain\r\nis indebted for the happy conduct of her arms, in whom she can boast,\r\nshe has produced a man formed by nature to lead a nation of heroes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 114: Edward Richard Montagu, styled Viscount Hinchinbroke, who\r\ndied before his father, on October 3, 1722, was the only son of Edward,\r\nthird Earl of Sandwich.

[STEELE.\r\n\r\nFrom _Thursday, April 21_, to _Saturday, April 23_, 1709.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nWill's Coffee-house, April 22.\r\n\r\nI am just come from visiting Sappho,[124] a fine lady, who writes\r\nverses, sings, dances and can say and do whatever she pleases, without\r\nthe imputation of anything that can injure her character; for she is so\r\nwell known to have no passion but self-love, or folly, but affectation;\r\nthat now upon any occasion they only cry, \"'Tis her way,\" and \"That's so\r\nlike her,\" without further reflection. As I came into the room, she\r\ncries, \"O Mr. Bickerstaff, I am utterly undone! I have broke that pretty\r\nItalian fan I showed you when you were here last, wherein were so\r\nadmirably drawn our first parents in Paradise asleep in each other's\r\narms.\" But there is such an affinity between painting and poetry, that I\r\nhave been improving the images which were raised by that picture, by\r\nreading the same representation in two of our greatest poets. Look you,\r\nhere are the passages in Milton and in Dryden. All Milton's thoughts are\r\nwonderfully just and natural, in this inimitable description which Adam\r\nmakes of himself in the eighth book of \"Paradise Lost.\" But there is\r\nnone of them finer than that contained in the following lines, where he\r\ntells us his thoughts when he was falling asleep a little after his\r\ncreation.\r\n\r\n    _While thus I called, and strayed I know not whither,\r\n    From whence I first drew air, and first beheld\r\n    This happy light; when answer none returned,\r\n    On a green shady bank, profuse of flowers,\r\n    Pensive I sate me down, there gentle sleep\r\n    First found me, and with soft oppression seized\r\n    My drowned sense, untroubled, though I thought\r\n    I then was passing to my former state,\r\n    Insensible, and forthwith to dissolve._[125]\r\n\r\nBut now I can't forgive this odious thing, this Dryden, who, in his\r\n\"State of Innocence,\" has given my great-grand-mother Eve the same\r\napprehension of annihilation, on a very different occasion, as Adam\r\npronounces it of himself, when he was seized with a pleasing kind of\r\nstupor and deadness, Eve fancies herself falling away, and dissolving in\r\nthe hurry of a rapture. However, the verses are very good, and I don't\r\nknow but it may be natural what she says. I'll read them:\r\n\r\n    _When your kind eyes looked languishing on mine,\r\n    And wreathing arms did soft embraces join,\r\n    A doubtful trembling seized me first all o'er,\r\n    Then wishes, and a warmth unknown before;\r\n    What followed was all extasy and trance,\r\n    Immortal pleasures round my swimming eyes did dance,\r\n    And speechless joys, in whose sweet tumults tost,\r\n    I thought my breath and my new being lost._[126]\r\n\r\nShe went on, and said a thousand good things at random, but so strangely\r\nmixed that you would be apt to say all her wit is mere good luck, and\r\nnot the effect of reason and judgment. When I made my escape hither I\r\nfound a gentleman playing the critic on two other great poets, even\r\nVirgil and Homer.[127] He was observing, that Virgil is more judicious\r\nthan the other in the epithets he gives his hero. \"Homer's usual\r\nepithet,\" said he, \"is Πόδας ὠχὺς [Pódas ôchùs], or Ποδάρχης [Podárchês],\r\nand his indiscretion has been often rallied by the critics, for\r\nmentioning the nimbleness of foot in Achilles, though he describes him\r\nstanding, sitting, lying down, fighting, eating, drinking, or in any\r\nother circumstance, however foreign or repugnant to speed and activity.\r\nVirgil's common epithet to Æneas, is 'Pius' or 'Pater.' I have therefore\r\nconsidered,\" said he, \"what passage there is in any of his hero's actions,\r\nwhere either of these appellations would have been most improper, to see\r\nif I could catch him at the same fault with Homer: and this, I think, is\r\nhis meeting with Dido in the cave, where Pius Æneas would have been\r\nabsurd, and Pater Æneas a burlesque: the poet has therefore wisely\r\ndropped them both for Dux Trojanus,\r\n\r\n    \"_Speluncam Dido dux et Trojanus eandem Devenient;_[128]\r\n\r\nwhich he has repeated twice in Juno's speech, and his own narration: for\r\nhe very well knew a loose action might be consistent enough with the\r\nusual manners of a soldier, though it became neither the chastity of a\r\npious man, nor the gravity of the father of a people.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nGrecian Coffee-house, April 22.\r\n\r\nWhile other parts of the town are amused with the present actions, we\r\ngenerally spend the evening at this table in inquiries into antiquity,\r\nand think anything news which gives us new knowledge. Thus we are making\r\na very pleasant entertainment to ourselves, in putting the actions of\r\nHomer's \"Iliad\" into an exact journal.\r\n\r\nThis poem is introduced by Chryses, King of Chryseis, and priest of\r\nApollo, who comes to re-demand his daughter, who was carried off at the\r\ntaking of that city, and given to Agamemnon for his part of the booty.\r\nThe refusal he received enrages Apollo, who for nine days showered down\r\ndarts upon them, which occasioned the pestilence.\r\n\r\nThe tenth day Achilles assembles the council, and encourages Chalcas to\r\nspeak for the surrender of Chryseis to appease Apollo. Agamemnon and\r\nAchilles storm at one another, notwithstanding which Agamemnon will not\r\nrelease his prisoner, unless he has Briseis in her stead. After long\r\ncontestations, wherein Agamemnon gives a glorious character of Achilles'\r\nvalour, he determines to restore Briseis to her father, and sends two\r\nheralds to fetch away Chryseis from Achilles, who abandons himself to\r\nsorrow and despair. His mother Thetis came to comfort him under his\r\naffliction, and promises to represent his sorrowful lamentations to\r\nJupiter; but he could not attend it; for the evening before, he had\r\nappointed to divert himself for two days beyond the seas with the\r\nharmless Æthiopians.\r\n\r\nIt was the twenty-first day after Chryseis' arrival to the camp, that\r\nThetis went very early to demand an audience of Jupiter. The means he\r\nuses to satisfy her were, to persuade the Greeks to attack the Trojans;\r\nthat so they might perceive the consequence of condemning Achilles and\r\nthe miseries they suffer if he does not head them. The next night he\r\norders Agamemnon, in a dream, to attack them; who was deceived with the\r\nhopes of obtaining a victory, and also taking the city, without sharing\r\nthe honour with Achilles.\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd, in the morning, he assembles the council, and having made a\r\nfeint of raising the siege and retiring, he declares to them his dream;\r\nand, together with Nestor and Ulysses, resolves on an engagement.\r\n\r\nThis was the twenty-third day, which is full of incidents, and which\r\ncontinues from almost the beginning of the second canto to the eighth.\r\nThe armies being then drawn up in view of one another, Hector brings it\r\nabout that Menelaus and Paris, the two persons concerned in the quarrel,\r\nshould decide it by a single combat; which tending to the advantage of\r\nMenelaus, was interrupted by a cowardice infused by Minerva: then both\r\narmies engage, where the Trojans have the disadvantage; but being\r\nafterwards animated by Apollo, they repulse the enemy, yet they are once\r\nagain forced to give ground; but their affairs were retrieved by Hector,\r\nwho has a single combat with Ajax. The gods threw themselves into the\r\nbattle, Juno and Minerva took the Grecians' part, and Apollo and Mars\r\nthe Trojans': but Mars and Venus are both wounded by Diomedes.\r\n\r\nThe truce for burying the slain ended the twenty-third day; after which\r\nthe Greeks threw up a great entrenchment to secure their navy from\r\ndanger. Councils are held on both sides. On the morning of the\r\ntwenty-fourth day the battle is renewed, but in a very disadvantageous\r\nmanner to the Greeks, who were beaten back to their retrenchments.\r\nAgamemnon being in despair at this ill success, proposes to the council\r\nto quit the enterprise and retire from Troy. But by the advice of\r\nNestor, he is persuaded to regain Achilles, by returning Chryseis, and\r\nsending him considerable presents. Hereupon, Ulysses and Ajax are sent\r\nto that hero, who continues inflexible in his anger. Ulysses, at his\r\nreturn, joins himself with Diomedes, and goes in the night to gain\r\nintelligence of the enemy: they enter into their very camp, where,\r\nfinding the sentinels asleep, they made a great slaughter. Rhesus, who\r\nwas just then arrived with recruits from Thrace for the Trojans, was\r\nkilled in that action. Here ends the tenth canto. The sequel of this\r\njournal will be inserted in the next article from this place.\r\n\r\n\r\nSt. James's Coffee-house, April 22.\r\n\r\nWe hear from Italy, that notwithstanding the Pope has received a letter\r\nfrom the Duke of Anjou, demanding of him to explain himself upon the\r\naffair of acknowledging King Charles: his Holiness has not yet thought\r\nfit to send any answer to that prince. The Court of Rome appears very\r\nmuch mortified, that they are not to see his Majesty of Denmark in that\r\ncity, having perhaps given themselves vain hopes from a visit made by a\r\nProtestant priest to that see. The Pope has despatched a gentleman to\r\ncompliment his Majesty, and sent the king a present of all the\r\ncuriosities and antiquities of Rome, represented in seventeen volumes,\r\nvery richly bound, which were taken out of the Vatican library. Letters\r\nfrom Genoa of the 14th instant say, a felucca was arrived there in five\r\ndays from Marseilles, with an account, that the people of that city had\r\nmade an insurrection, by reason of the scarcity of provisions, and that\r\nthe Intendant had ordered some companies of marines, and the men\r\nbelonging to the galleys, to stand to their arms to protect him from\r\nviolence; but that he began to be in as much apprehension of his guards\r\nas those from whom they were to defend him. When that vessel came away,\r\nthe soldiers murmured publicly for want of pay, and it was generally\r\nbelieved they would pillage the magazines, as the garrison of Grenoble,\r\nand other towns of France, had already done. A vessel which lately came\r\ninto Leghorn, brought advice, that the British squadron was arrived at\r\nPort Mahon, where they were taking in more troops, in order to attempt\r\nthe relief of Alicante, which still made a very vigorous defence. 'Tis\r\nsaid, Admiral Byng will be at the head of that expedition. The King of\r\nDenmark was gone from Leghorn towards Lucca.\r\n\r\nThey write from Vienna, that in case the Allies should enter into a\r\ntreaty of peace with France, Count Zinzendorf will be appointed first\r\nplenipotentiary, the Count de Goes the second, and Monsieur van\r\nKonsbruch a third. Major-General Palmes, Envoy Extraordinary from her\r\nBritannic Majesty, has been very urgent with that Court to make their\r\nutmost efforts against France the ensuing campaign, in order to oblige\r\nit to such a peace, as may establish the tranquillity of Europe for the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nWe are also informed, that the Pope uses all imaginable shifts to elude\r\nthe treaty concluded with the Emperor, and that he demanded the\r\nimmediate restitution of Commacchio; insisting also, that his Imperial\r\nMajesty should ask pardon, and desire absolution for what has formerly\r\npassed, before he would solemnly acknowledge King Charles: but this was\r\nutterly refused.\r\n\r\nThey hear at Vienna, by letters from Constantinople, dated the 22nd of\r\nFebruary last, that on the 12th of that month the Grand Signior took\r\noccasion, at the celebration of the festivals of the Mussulmen, to set\r\nall the Christian slaves which were in the galleys at liberty.\r\n\r\nAdvices from Switzerland import, that the preachers of the county of\r\nTockenburg continue to create new jealousies of the Protestants, and\r\nsome disturbances lately happened there on that account. The Protestants\r\nand Papists in the town of Hamman go to divine service one after another\r\nin the same church, as is usual in many other parts of Switzerland; but\r\non Sunday, the 10th instant, the Popish curate, having ended his\r\nservice, attempted to hinder the Protestants from entering into the\r\nchurch according to custom; but the Protestants briskly attacked him and\r\nhis party, and broke into it by force.\r\n\r\nLast night between seven and eight, his Grace the Duke of Marlborough\r\narrived at Court.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom my own Apartment, April 22.\r\n\r\nThe present great captains of the age, the Duke of Marlborough and\r\nPrince Eugene, having been the subject of the discourse of the last\r\ncompany I was in, it has naturally led me into a consideration of\r\nAlexander and Cæsar, the two greatest names which ever appeared before\r\nthis century. In order to enter into their characters, there needs no\r\nmore but examining their behaviour in parallel circumstances. It must be\r\nallowed, that they had an equal greatness of soul; but Cæsar's was more\r\ncorrected and allayed by a mixture of prudence and circumspection. This\r\nis seen conspicuously in one particular in their histories, wherein they\r\nseem to have shown exactly the difference of their tempers. When\r\nAlexander, after a long course of victories, would still have led his\r\nsoldiers farther from home, they unanimously refused to follow him. We\r\nmeet with the like behaviour in Cæsar's army in the midst of his march\r\nagainst Ariovistus. Let us therefore observe the conduct of our two\r\ngenerals in so nice an affair: and here we find Alexander at the head of\r\nhis army, upbraiding them with their cowardice, and meanness of spirit;\r\nand in the end, telling them plainly, he would go forward himself,\r\nthough not a man followed him. This showed indeed an excessive bravery;\r\nbut how would the commander have come off, if the speech had not\r\nsucceeded, and the soldiers had taken him at his word? The project seems\r\nof a piece with Mr. Bayes' in \"The Rehearsal,\"[129] who, to gain a clap\r\nin his prologue, comes out, with a terrible fellow in a fur cap\r\nfollowing him, and tells his audience, if they would not like his play,\r\nhe would lie down and have his head struck off. If this gained a clap,\r\nall was well; but if not, there was nothing left but for the executioner\r\nto do his office. But Cæsar would not leave the success of his speech\r\nto such uncertain events: he shows his men the unreasonableness of their\r\nfears in an obliging manner, and concludes, that if none else would\r\nmarch along with them, he would go himself with the Tenth Legion, for he\r\nwas assured of their fidelity and valour, though all the rest forsook\r\nhim; not but that in all probability they were as much against the march\r\nas the rest. The result of all was very natural: the Tenth Legion, fired\r\nwith the praises of their general, send thanks to him for the just\r\nopinion he entertains of them; and the rest, ashamed to be outdone,\r\nassure him, that they are as ready to follow where he pleases to lead\r\nthem, as any other part of the army.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 124: It has been suggested, with little or no reason, that\r\nSappho is meant for Mrs. Manley (Author of the \"New Atalantis\"), or Mrs.\r\nElizabeth Thomas (known as \"Corinna\"), or Mrs. Elizabeth Heywood.

Had it been otherwise,\r\nyou may be sure I would not have pretended to have given for news, as I\r\ndid last Saturday, a diary of the siege of Troy. But man is a creature\r\nvery inconsistent with himself: the greatest heroes are sometimes\r\nfearful, the sprightliest wits at some hours dull; and the greatest\r\npoliticians on some occasions whimsical. But I shall not pretend to\r\npalliate, or excuse the matter; for I find, by a calculation of my own\r\nnativity, that I cannot hold out with any tolerable wit longer than two\r\nminutes after twelve o'clock at night, between the 18th and 19th of the\r\nnext month. For which space of time you may still expect to hear from\r\nme, but no longer, except you will transmit to me the occurrences you\r\nmeet with relating to your amours, or any other subject within the rules\r\nby which I have proposed to walk. If any gentleman or lady sends to\r\nIsaac Bickerstaff, Esq., at Mr. Morphew's,[130] near Stationers' Hall,\r\nby the Penny Post, the grief or joy of their soul, what they think fit\r\nof the matter shall be related in colours as much to their advantage, as\r\nthose in which Jervas[131] has drawn the agreeable Chloe. But since,\r\nwithout such assistance, I frankly confess, and am sensible, that I\r\nhave not a month's wit more, I think I ought, while I am in my sound\r\nhealth and senses, to make my will and testament; which I do in manner\r\nand form following:\r\n\r\nImprimis, I give to the stockjobbers about the Exchange of London, as a\r\nsecurity for the trusts daily reposed in them, all my real estate; which\r\nI do hereby vest in the said body of worthy citizens for ever.\r\n\r\nItem, Forasmuch as it is very hard to keep land in repair without ready\r\ncash, I do, out of my personal estate, bestow the bearskin,[132] which I\r\nhave frequently lent to several societies about this town, to supply\r\ntheir necessities. I say, I give also the said bearskin, as an immediate\r\nfund to the said citizens for ever.\r\n\r\nItem, I do hereby appoint a certain number of the said citizens to take\r\nall the custom-house or customary oaths, concerning all goods imported\r\nto the whole city, strictly directing, that some select members, and not\r\nthe whole number of a body corporate, should be perjured.\r\n\r\nItem, I forbid all n----s and persons of q----ty to watch bargains near\r\nand about the Exchange, to the diminution and wrong of the said\r\nstockjobbers.\r\n\r\nThus far, in as brief and intelligible a manner as any will can appear,\r\ntill it is explained by the learned, I have disposed of my real and\r\npersonal estate: but, as I am an adept, I have by birth an equal right\r\nto give also an indefeasible title to my endowments and qualifications;\r\nwhich I do in the following manner:\r\n\r\nItem, I give my chastity to all virgins who have withstood their\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\nItem, I give my courage among all who are ashamed of their distressed\r\nfriends, all sneakers in assemblies, and men who show valour in common\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\nItem, I give my wit (as rich men give to the rich) among such as think\r\nthey have enough already. And in case they shall not accept of the\r\nlegacy, I give it to Bentivolio,[133] to defend his works from time to\r\ntime, as he shall think fit to publish them.\r\n\r\nItem, I bestow my learning upon the honorary members of the Royal\r\nSociety.[134]\r\n\r\nNow for the disposal of this body.\r\n\r\nAs these eyes must one day cease to gaze on Teraminta, and this heart\r\nshall one day pant no more for her indignation: that is to say, since\r\nthis body must be earth, I shall commit it to the dust in a manner\r\nsuitable to my character. Therefore, as there are those who dispute,\r\nwhether there is any such real person as Isaac Bickerstaff or not, I\r\nshall excuse all persons who appear what they really are, from coming to\r\nmy funeral. But all those who are, in their way of life, persons, as the\r\nLatins have it, persons assumed, and who appear what they really are\r\nnot, are hereby invited to that solemnity.\r\n\r\nThe body shall be carried by six watchmen, who are never seen in the\r\nday.\r\n\r\nItem, The pall shall be held up by the six most known pretenders to\r\nhonesty, wealth and power, who are not possessed of any of them. The\r\ntwo first, an half-lawyer, a complete justice. The two next, a chemist,\r\na projector. The third couple, a Treasury solicitor, and a small\r\ncourtier.\r\n\r\nTo make my funeral (what that solemnity, when done to common men, really\r\nis in itself) a very farce; and since all mourners are mere actors on\r\nthese occasions, I shall desire those who are professedly such, to\r\nattend me. I humbly therefore beseech Mrs. Barry[135] to act once more,\r\nand be my widow. When she swoons away at the church-porch, I appoint the\r\nmerry Sir John Falstaff, and the gay Sir Harry Wildair, to support her.\r\nI desire Mr. Pinkethman[136] to follow in the habit of a cardinal, and\r\nMr. Bullock[137] in that of a privy councillor. To make up the rest of\r\nthe appearance, I desire all the ladies from the balconies to weep with\r\nMrs. Barry, as they hope to be wives and widows themselves. I invite\r\nall, who have nothing else to do, to accept of gloves and scarves.\r\n\r\nThus, with the great Charles V. of Spain, I resign the glories of this\r\ntransitory world: yet, at the same time, to show you my indifference,\r\nand that my desires are not too much fixed upon anything, I own to you,\r\nI am as willing to stay as go: therefore leave it in the choice of my\r\ngentle readers, whether I shall hear from them, or they hear no more\r\nfrom me.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhite's Chocolate-house, April 25.\r\n\r\nEaster Day being a time when you can't well meet with any but humble\r\nadventures; and there being such a thing as low gallantry, as well as a\r\nlow comedy, Colonel Ramble[138] and myself went early this morning into\r\nthe fields, which were strewed with shepherds and shepherdesses, but\r\nindeed of a different turn from the simplicity of those of Arcadia.\r\nEvery hedge was conscious of more than what the representations of\r\nenamoured swains admit of. While we were surveying the crowd around us,\r\nwe saw at a distance a company coming towards Pancras Church; but though\r\nthere was not much disorder, we thought we saw the figure of a man stuck\r\nthrough with a sword, and at every step ready to fall, if a woman by his\r\nside had not supported him; the rest followed two and two. When we came\r\nnearer this appearance, who should it be but Monsieur Guardeloop, mine\r\nand Ramble's French tailor, attended by others, leading one of Madame\r\nDepingle's[139] maids to the church, in order to their espousals. It was\r\nhis sword tucked so high above his waist, and the circumflex which\r\npersons of his profession take in their walking, that made him appear at\r\na distance wounded and falling. But the morning being rainy, methought\r\nthe march to this wedding was but too lively a picture of wedlock\r\nitself. They seemed both to have a month's mind to make the best of\r\ntheir way single; yet both tugged arm in arm; and when they were in a\r\ndirty way, he was but deeper in the mire, by endeavouring to pull out\r\nhis companion, and yet without helping her. The bridegroom's feathers in\r\nhis hat all drooped, one of his shoes had lost an heel. In short, he was\r\nin his whole person and dress so extremely soused, that there did not\r\nappear one inch or single thread about him unmarried.[140] Pardon me,\r\nthat the melancholy object still dwells upon me so far, as to reduce me\r\nto punning. However, we attended to the chapel, where we stayed to hear\r\nthe irrevocable words pronounced upon our old servant, and made the best\r\nof our way to town. I took a resolution to forbear all married persons,\r\nor any, in danger of being such, for four-and-twenty hours at least;\r\ntherefore dressed, and went to visit Florimel, the vainest thing in\r\ntown, where I knew would drop in Colonel Picket, just come from the\r\ncamp, her professed admirer. He is of that order of men who has much\r\nhonour and merit, but withal a coxcomb; the other of that set of\r\nfemales, who has innocence and wit, but the first of coquettes. It is\r\neasy to believe, these must be admirers of each other. She says, \"The\r\nColonel rides the best of any man in England\": the Colonel says, \"She\r\ntalks the best of any woman.\" At the same time, he understands wit just\r\nas she does horsemanship. You are to know, these extraordinary persons\r\nsee each other daily; and they themselves, as well as the town, think it\r\nwill be a match: but it can never happen that they can come to the\r\npoint; for instead of addressing to each other, they spend their whole\r\ntime in reports of themselves. He is satisfied if he can convince her he\r\nis a fine gentleman, and a man of consequence; and she, in appearing to\r\nhim an accomplished lady and a wit, without further design. Thus he\r\ntells her of his manner of posting his men at such a pass, with the\r\nnumbers he commanded on that detachment: she tells him, how she was\r\ndressed on such a day at Court, and what offers were made her the week\r\nfollowing. She seems to hear the repetition of his men's names with\r\nadmiration; and waits only to answer him with as false a muster of\r\nlovers. They talk to each other not to be informed, but approved. Thus\r\nthey are so like, that they are to be ever distant, and the parallel\r\nlines may run together for ever, but never meet.\r\n\r\n\r\nWill's Coffee-house, April 25.\r\n\r\nThis evening, the comedy, called \"Epsom Wells,\"[141] was acted for the\r\nbenefit of Mr. Bullock,[142] who, though he is a person of much wit and\r\ningenuity, has a peculiar talent of looking like a fool, and therefore\r\nexcellently well qualified for the part of Biskett in this play. I\r\ncannot indeed sufficiently admire his way of bearing a beating, as he\r\ndoes in this drama, and that with such a natural air and propriety of\r\nfolly, that one cannot help wishing the whip in one's own hand; so\r\nrichly does he seem to deserve his chastisement. Skilful actors think it\r\na very peculiar happiness to play in a scene with such as top their\r\nparts. Therefore I cannot but say, when the judgment of any good author\r\ndirects him to write a beating for Mr. Bullock from Mr. William\r\nPinkethman, or for Mr. William Pinkethman from Mr. Bullock, those\r\nexcellent players seem to be in their most shining circumstances, and\r\nplease me more, but with a different sort of delight, than that which I\r\nreceive from those grave scenes of Brutus and Cassius, or Antony and\r\nVentidius. The whole comedy is very just, and the low part of human life\r\nrepresented with much humour and wit.\r\n\r\n\r\nSt. James's Coffee-house, April 25.\r\n\r\nWe are advised from Vienna, by letters of the 20th instant, that the\r\nEmperor hath lately added twenty new members to his Council of State,\r\nbut they have not yet taken their places at the board. General Thaun is\r\nreturned from Baden, his health being so well re-established by the\r\nbaths of that place, that he designs to set out next week for Turin, to\r\nhis command of the Imperial troops in the service of the Duke of Savoy.\r\nHis Imperial Majesty has advanced his brother Count Henry Thaun to be a\r\nbrigadier, and a Councillor of the Aulic Council of War. These letters\r\nimport, that King Stanislaus and the Swedish General Crassau are\r\ndirecting their march to the Nieper, to join the King of Sweden's army\r\nin Ukrania: that the States of Austria have furnished Marshal Heister\r\nwith a considerable sum of money, to enable him to push on the war\r\nvigorously in Hungary, where all things as yet are in perfect\r\ntranquillity: and that General Thungen has been very importunate for a\r\nspeedy reinforcement of the forces on the Upper Rhine, representing at\r\nthe same time, what miseries the inhabitants must necessarily undergo,\r\nif the designs of France on those parts be not speedily and effectually\r\nprevented.\r\n\r\nLetters from Rome, dated the 13th instant, say, that on the preceding\r\nSunday his Holiness was carried in an open chair from St. Peter's to St.\r\nMary's, attended by the Sacred College, in cavalcade; and, after Mass,\r\ndistributed several dowries for the marriage of poor and distressed\r\nvirgins. The proceedings of that Court are very dilatory concerning the\r\nrecognition of King Charles, notwithstanding the pressing instances of\r\nthe Marquis de Prie, who has declared, that if this affair be not wholly\r\nconcluded by the 15th instant, he will retire from that Court, and order\r\nthe Imperial troops to return into the ecclesiastical state. On the\r\nother hand, the Duke of Anjou's minister has, in the name of his master,\r\ndemanded of his Holiness to explain himself on that affair; which, it is\r\nsaid, will be finally determined in a consistory to be held on Monday\r\nnext; the Duke d'Uzeda designing to delay his departure till he sees the\r\nissue. These letters also say, that the Court was mightily alarmed at\r\nthe news which they received by an express from Ferrara, that General\r\nBoneval, who commands in Commachio, had sent circular letters to the\r\ninhabitants of St. Alberto, Longastrino, Fillo, and other adjacent\r\nparts, enjoining them to come and swear fealty to the Emperor, and\r\nreceive new investitures of their fiefs from his hands. Letters from\r\nother parts of Italy say, that the King of Denmark continues at Lucca;\r\nthat four English and Dutch men-of-war were seen off of Oneglia, bound\r\nfor Final, in order to transport the troops designed for Barcelona; and\r\nthat her Majesty's ship the _Colchester_ arrived at Leghorn the 4th\r\ninstant from Port Mahon, with advice, that Major-General Stanhope\r\ndesigned to part from thence the 1st instant with 6000 or 7000 men to\r\nattempt the relief of the Castle of Alicant.\r\n\r\nOur last advices from Berlin, bearing date the 27th instant, import,\r\nthat the King was gone to Linum, and the Queen to Mecklenburg; but that\r\ntheir Majesties designed to return the next week to Oranienburg, where a\r\ngreat chase of wild beasts was prepared for their diversion, and from\r\nthence they intend to proceed together to Potsdam; that the Prince Royal\r\nwas set out for Brabant, but intended to make some short stay at\r\nHanover. These letters also inform us, that they are advised from Obory,\r\nthat the King of Sweden, being on his march towards Holki, met General\r\nRenne with a detachment of Muscovites, who placing some regiments in\r\nambuscade, attacked the Swedes in their rear, and putting them to\r\nflight, killed 2000 men, the king himself having his horse shot under\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nWe hear from Copenhagen, that, the ice being broke, the Sound is again\r\nopen for the ships; and that they hoped his Majesty would return sooner\r\nthan they at first expected.\r\n\r\nLetters from the Hague, dated May the 4th, N.S., say that an express\r\narrived there on the 1st from Prince Eugene to his Grace the Duke of\r\nMarlborough. The States are advised, that the auxiliaries of Saxony\r\nwere arrived on the frontiers of the United Provinces; as also, that the\r\ntwo regiments of Wolfembuttel, and 4000 troops from Wirtemberg, which\r\nare to serve in Flanders, are in full march thither. Letters from\r\nFlanders, say that the great convoy of ammunition and provisions which\r\nset out from Ghent for Lille, was safely arrived at Courtray. We hear\r\nfrom Paris, that the King has ordered the militia on the coasts of\r\nNormandy and Bretagne to be in a readiness to march; and that the Court\r\nwas in apprehension of a descent, to animate the people to rise in the\r\nmidst of their present hardships.\r\n\r\nThey write from Spain, that the Pope's Nuncio left Madrid the 10th of\r\nApril, in order to go to Bayonne; that the Marquis de Bay was at Badajos\r\nto observe the motions of the Portuguese; and that the Count d'Estain,\r\nwith a body of 5000 men, was on his march to attack Gironne. The Duke\r\nof Anjou has deposed the Bishop of Lerida, as being a favourer of the\r\ninterest of King Charles; and has summoned a convocation at Madrid,\r\ncomposed of the archbishops, bishops and states of that kingdom,\r\nwherein he hopes they will come to a resolution to send for no more\r\nbulls to Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 130: John Morphew was the publisher of the _Tatler_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 131: See No. 4.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 132: Stockjobbers, who contract for a sale of stock which they\r\ndo not possess, are called sellers of bearskins; and universally whoever\r\nsells what he does not possess was said to sell the bear's skin, while\r\nthe bear runs in the woods. \"You never heard such bellowing about the\r\ntown of the state of the nation, especially among the sharpers, sellers\r\nof bearskins--_i.e._ stockjobbers, &c.\" (Swift).

The indignation which Eugenio, who is a gentleman\r\nof a just taste, has, upon occasion of seeing human nature fall so low\r\nin their delights, made him, I thought, expatiate upon the mention of\r\nthis play very agreeably. \"Of all men living,\" said he, \"I pity players\r\n(who must be men of good understanding to be capable of being such) that\r\nthey are obliged to repeat and assume proper gestures for representing\r\nthings, of which their reason must be ashamed, and which they must\r\ndisdain their audience for approving. The amendment of these low\r\ngratifications is only to be made by people of condition, by encouraging\r\nthe presentation of the noble characters drawn by Shakespeare and\r\nothers, from whence it is impossible to return without strong\r\nimpressions of honour and humanity. On these occasions, distress is laid\r\nbefore us with all its causes and consequences, and our resentment\r\nplaced according to the merit of the persons afflicted. Were dramas of\r\nthis nature more acceptable to the taste of the town, men who have\r\ngenius would bend their studies to excel in them. How forcible an effect\r\nthis would have on our minds, one needs no more than to observe how\r\nstrongly we are touched by mere pictures. Who can see Le Brun's[144]\r\npicture of the Battle of Porus, without entering into the character of\r\nthat fierce gallant man,[145] and being accordingly spurred to an\r\nemulation of his constancy and courage? When he is falling with his\r\nwound, the features are at the same time very terrible and languishing;\r\nand there is such a stern faintness diffused through his look, as is\r\napt to move a kind of horror, as well as pity, in the beholder. This, I\r\nsay, is an effect wrought by mere lights and shades; consider also a\r\nrepresentation made by words only, as in an account given by a good\r\nwriter: Catiline in Sallust makes just such a figure as Porus by Le\r\nBrun. It is said of him, 'Catilina vero longe a suis inter hostium\r\ncadavera repertus est; paululum etiam spirans, ferocitatemque animi quam\r\nvivus habuerat in vultu retinens.'[146] ('Catiline was found killed far\r\nfrom his own men among the dead bodies of the enemy: he seemed still to\r\nbreathe, and still retained in his face the same fierceness he had when\r\nhe was living.') You have in that one sentence, a lively impression of\r\nhis whole life and actions. What I would insinuate from all this, is,\r\nthat if the painter and the historian can do thus much in colours and\r\nlanguage, what may not be performed by an excellent poet, when the\r\ncharacter he draws is presented by the person, the manner, the look, and\r\nthe motion, of an accomplished player? If a thing painted or related can\r\nirresistibly enter our hearts, what may not be brought to pass by seeing\r\ngenerous things performed before our eyes?\" Eugenio ended his discourse,\r\nby recommending the apt use of a theatre, as the most agreeable and easy\r\nmethod of making a polite and moral gentry, which would end in rendering\r\nthe rest of the people regular in their behaviour, and ambitious of\r\nlaudable undertakings.\r\n\r\n\r\nSt. James's Coffee-house, April 27.\r\n\r\nLetters from Naples of the 9th instant, N.S., advise, that Cardinal\r\nGrimani had ordered the regiment commanded by General Pate to march\r\ntowards Final, in order to embark for Catalonia, whither also a\r\nthousand horse are to be transported from Sardinia, besides the troops\r\nwhich come from the Milanese. An English man-of-war has taken two\r\nprizes, one a vessel of Malta, the other of Genoa, both laden with goods\r\nof the enemy. They write from Florence of the 13th, that his Majesty of\r\nDenmark had received a courier from the Hague, with an account of some\r\nmatters relating to the treaty of a peace; upon which he declared, that\r\nhe thought it necessary to hasten to his own dominions.\r\n\r\nLetters from Switzerland inform us, that the effects of the great\r\nscarcity of corn in France were felt at Geneva; the magistrates of which\r\ncity had appointed deputies to treat with the cantons of Berne and\r\nZurich, for leave to buy up such quantities of grain within their\r\nterritories as should be thought necessary. The Protestants of\r\nTockenburg are still in arms about the convent of St. John, and have\r\ndeclared, that they will not lay them down, till they shall have\r\nsufficient security from the Roman Catholics, of living unmolested in\r\nthe exercise of their religion. In the meantime the deputies of Berne\r\nand Tockenburg have frequent conferences at Zurich, with the regency of\r\nthat canton, to find out methods for the quieting these disorders.\r\n\r\nLetters from the Hague of the 3rd of May advise, that the President\r\nRouillé, after his last conference with the deputies of the States, had\r\nretired to Bodegrave, five miles distant from Worden, and expected the\r\nreturn of a courier from France on the 4th, with new instructions. It is\r\nsaid, if his answer from the French Court shall not prove satisfactory,\r\nhe will be desired to withdraw out of these parts. In the meantime it is\r\nalso reported, that his equipage, as an ambassador on this great\r\noccasion, is actually on the march towards him. They write from\r\nFlanders, that the great convoy of provisions, which set out from Ghent,\r\nis safely arrived at Lille. Those advices add, that the enemy had\r\nassembled near Tournay a considerable body of troops drawn out of the\r\nneighbouring garrisons. Their high mightinesses having sent orders to\r\ntheir Ministers at Hamburg and Dantzic, to engage the magistrates of\r\nthose cities to forbid the sale of corn to the French, and to signify to\r\nthem, that the Dutch merchants will buy up as much of that commodity as\r\nthey can spare, the Hamburgers have accordingly contracted with the\r\nDutch, and refused any commerce with the French on that occasion.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom my own Apartment.\r\n\r\nAfter the lassitude of a day spent in the strolling manner, which is\r\nusual with men of pleasure in this town, and with a head full of a\r\nmillion of impertinences, which had danced round it for ten hours\r\ntogether, I came to my lodging, and hastened to bed. My\r\n_valet-de-chambre_[147] knows my University trick of reading there; and\r\nhe being: a good scholar for a gentleman, ran over the names of Horace,\r\nTibullus, Ovid, and others, to know which I would have. \"Bring Virgil,\"\r\nsaid I, \"and if I fall asleep, take care of the candle.\" I read the\r\nsixth book over with the most exquisite delight, and had gone half\r\nthrough it a second time, when the pleasing ideas of Elysian Fields,\r\ndeceased worthies walking in them, sincere lovers enjoying their\r\nlanguishment without pain, compassion for the unhappy spirits who had\r\nmisspent their short daylight, and were exiled from the seats of bliss\r\nfor ever; I say, I was deep again in my reading, when this mixture of\r\nimages had taken place of all others in my imagination before, and\r\nlulled me into a dream, from which I am just awake, to my great\r\ndisadvantage. The happy mansions of Elysium by degrees seemed to be\r\nwafted from me, and the very traces of my late waking thoughts began to\r\nfade away, when I was cast by a sudden whirlwind upon an island,\r\nencompassed with a roaring and troubled sea, which shaked its very\r\ncentre, and rocked its inhabitants as in a cradle. The islanders lay on\r\ntheir faces, without offering to look up, or hope for preservation; all\r\nher harbours were crowded with mariners, and tall vessels of war lay in\r\ndanger of being driven to pieces on her shores. \"Bless me!\" said I, \"why\r\nhave I lived in such a manner that the convulsion of nature should be so\r\nterrible to me, when I feel in myself, that the better part of me is to\r\nsurvive it? Oh! may that be in happiness.\" A sudden shriek, in which the\r\nwhole people on their faces joined, interrupted my soliloquy, and turned\r\nmy eyes and attention to the object which had given us that sudden\r\nstart, in the midst of an inconsolable and speechless affliction.\r\nImmediately the winds grew calm, the waves subsided, and the people\r\nstood up, turning their faces upon a magnificent pile in the midst of\r\nthe island. There we beheld an hero of a comely and erect aspect, but\r\npale and languid, sitting under a canopy of state. By the faces and dumb\r\nsorrow of those who attended we thought him in the article of death. At\r\na distance sat a lady, whose life seemed to hang upon the same thread\r\nwith his: she kept her eyes fixed upon him, and seemed to smother ten\r\nthousand thousand nameless things, which urged her tenderness to clasp\r\nhim in her arms: but her greatness of spirit overcame those sentiments,\r\nand gave her power to forbear disturbing his last moment; which\r\nimmediately approached. The hero looked up with an air of negligence,\r\nand satiety of being, rather than of pain to leave it; and leaning back\r\nhis head, expired.[148]\r\n\r\nWhen the heroine, who sat at a distance, saw his last instant come, she\r\nthrew herself at his feet, and kneeling, pressed his hand to her lips;\r\nin which posture she continued under the agony of an unutterable sorrow,\r\ntill conducted from our sight by her attendants. That commanding awe,\r\nwhich accompanies the grief of great minds, restrained the multitude\r\nwhile in her presence; but as soon as she retired, they gave way to\r\ntheir distraction, and all the islanders called upon their deceased\r\nhero. To him, methought, they cried out, as to a guardian being, and I\r\ngathered from their broken accents, that it was he who had the empire\r\nover the ocean and its powers, by which he had long protected the island\r\nfrom shipwreck and invasion. They now give a loose to their moan, and\r\nthink themselves exposed without hopes of human or divine assistance.\r\nWhile the people ran wild, and expressed all the different forms of\r\nlamentation, methought a sable cloud overshadowed the whole land, and\r\ncovered its inhabitants with darkness: no glimpse of light appeared,\r\nexcept one ray from heaven upon the place in which the heroine now\r\nsecluded herself from the world, with her eyes fixed on those abodes to\r\nwhich her consort was ascended.[149] Methought, a long period of time\r\nhad passed away in mourning and in darkness, when a twilight began by\r\ndegrees to enlighten the hemisphere; and looking round me, I saw a boat\r\nrowed towards the shore, in which sat a personage adorned with warlike\r\ntrophies, bearing on his left arm a shield, on which was engraven the\r\nimage of Victory, and in his right hand a branch of olive. His visage\r\nwas at once so winning and so awful, that the shield and the olive\r\nseemed equally suitable to his genius.\r\n\r\nWhen this illustrious person[150] touched on the shore, he was received\r\nby the acclamations of the people, and followed to the palace of the\r\nheroine. No pleasure in the glory of her arms, or the acclamations\r\nof her applauding subjects, were ever capable to suspend her sorrow for\r\none moment, until she saw the olive branch in the hand of that\r\nauspicious messenger. At that sight, as Heaven bestows its blessings on\r\nthe wants and importunities of mortals, out of its native bounty, and\r\nnot to increase its own power, or honour, in compassion to the world,\r\nthe celestial mourner was then first seen to turn her regard to things\r\nbelow; and taking the branch out of the warrior's hand, looked at it\r\nwith much satisfaction, and spoke of the blessings of peace, with a\r\nvoice and accent, such as that in which guardian spirits whisper to\r\ndying penitents assurances of happiness. The air was hushed, the\r\nmultitude attentive, and all nature in a pause, while she was speaking.\r\nBut as soon as the messenger of peace had made some low reply, in\r\nwhich, methought, I heard the word Iberia, the heroine assuming a more\r\nsevere air, but such as spoke resolution, without rage, returned him\r\nthe olive, and again veiled her face. Loud cries and clashing of arms\r\nimmediately followed, which forced me from my charming vision, and\r\ndrove me back to these mansions of care and sorrow.[151]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 143: A very coarse play by Edward Ravenscroft, produced in\r\n1682, and often acted on Lord Mayors' days and other holidays.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 144: Charles Le Brun, who was born in 1619, and died in 1690,\r\nwas the son of a sculptor, of Scotch extraction.

[STEELE.\r\n\r\nFrom _Thursday, April 28_, to _Saturday, April 30_, 1709.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nWill's Coffee-house, April 28.\r\n\r\nThis evening we were entertained with \"The Old Bachelor,\"[152] a comedy\r\nof deserved reputation. In the character which gives name to the play,\r\nthere is excellently represented the reluctance of a battered debauchee\r\nto come into the trammels of order and decency: he neither languishes\r\nnor burns, but frets for love. The gentlemen of more regular behaviour\r\nare drawn with much spirit and wit, and the drama introduced by the\r\ndialogue of the first scene with uncommon, yet natural conversation. The\r\npart of Fondlewife is a lively image of the unseasonable fondness of age\r\nand impotence. But instead of such agreeable works as these, the town\r\nhas this half age been tormented with insects called \"easy writers,\"\r\nwhose abilities Mr. Wycherley one day described excellently well in one\r\nword: \"That,\" said he, \"among these fellows is called easy writing,\r\nwhich any one may easily write.\" Such jaunty scribblers are so justly\r\nlaughed at for their sonnets on Phillis and Chloris, and fantastical\r\ndescriptions in them, that an ingenious kinsman of mine,[153] of the\r\nfamily of the Staffs, Mr. Humphrey Wagstaff by name, has, to avoid their\r\nstrain, run into a way perfectly new, and described things exactly as\r\nthey happen: he never forms fields, or nymphs, or groves, where they are\r\nnot, but makes the incidents just as they really appear. For an example\r\nof it; I stole out of his manuscript the following lines: they are a\r\nDescription of the Morning, but of the morning in town; nay, of the\r\nmorning at this end of the town, where my kinsman at present lodges.\r\n\r\n    Now hardly here and there an hackney coach\r\n    Appearing, showed the ruddy morn's approach.\r\n    Now Betty from her master's bed had flown,\r\n    And softly stole to discompose her own.\r\n    The slipshod 'prentice from his master's door,\r\n    Had pared the street, and sprinkled round the floor.\r\n    Now Moll had whirled her mop with dext'rous airs,\r\n    Prepared to scrub the entry and the stairs.\r\n    The youth with broomy stumps began to trace\r\n    The kennel edge, where wheels had worn the place.\r\n    The smallcoal-man was heard with cadence deep,\r\n    Till drowned in shriller notes of chimney-sweep.\r\n    Duns at his lordship's gate began to meet;\r\n    And Brickdust Moll had screamed through half a street;\r\n    The turnkey now his flock returning sees,\r\n    Duly let out at nights to steal for fees.\r\n    The watchful bailiffs take their silent stands;\r\n    And schoolboys lag with satchels in their hands.\r\n\r\nAll that I apprehend is, that dear Numps will be angry I have published\r\nthese lines; not that he has any reason to be ashamed of them, but for\r\nfear of those rogues, the bane to all excellent performances, the\r\nimitators. Therefore, beforehand, I bar all descriptions of the\r\nevenings; as, a medley of verses signifying, grey-peas are now cried\r\nwarm: that wenches now begin to amble round the passages of the\r\nplayhouse: or of noon; as, that fine ladies and great beaux are just\r\nyawning out of their beds and windows in Pall Mall, and so forth. I\r\nforewarn also all persons from encouraging any draughts after my\r\ncousin; and foretell any man who shall go about to imitate him, that he\r\nwill be very insipid. The family stock is embarked in this design, and\r\nwe will not admit of counterfeits: Dr. Anderson[154] and his heirs enjoy\r\nhis pills, Sir. William Read[155] has the cure of eyes, and Monsieur\r\nRozelli[156] can only cure the gout. We pretend to none of these things;\r\nbut to examine who and who are together, to tell any mistaken man he is\r\nnot what he believes he is, to distinguish merit, and expose false\r\npretences to it, is a liberty our family has by law in them, from an\r\nintermarriage with a daughter of Mr. Scoggan,[157] the famous droll of\r\nthe last century. This right I design to make use of; but will not\r\nencroach upon the above-mentioned adepts, or any other. At the same\r\ntime I shall take all the privileges I may, as an Englishman, and will\r\nlay hold of the late Act of Naturalisation[158] to introduce what I\r\nshall think fit from France. The use of that law may, I hope, be\r\nextended to people the polite world with new characters, as well as the\r\nkingdom itself with new subjects. Therefore an author of that nation,\r\ncalled La Bruyère, I shall make bold with on such occasions. The last\r\nperson I read of in that writer, was Lord Timon.[159] Timon, says my\r\nauthor, is the most generous of all men; but is so hurried away with\r\nthat strong impulse of bestowing, that he confers benefits without\r\ndistinction, and is munificent without laying obligations. For all the\r\nunworthy, who receive from him, have so little sense of this noble\r\ninfirmity, that they look upon themselves rather as partners in a spoil,\r\nthan partakers of a bounty. The other day, coming into Paris, I met\r\nTimon going out on horseback, attended only by one servant. It struck me\r\nwith a sudden damp, to see a man of so excellent a disposition, and that\r\nunderstood making a figure so very well, so much shortened in his\r\nretinue. But passing by his house, I saw his great coach break to pieces\r\nbefore his door, and by a strange enchantment, immediately turned into\r\nmany different vehicles. The first was a very pretty chariot, into which\r\nstepped his lordship's secretary. The second was hung a little heavier;\r\ninto that strutted the fat steward. In an instant followed a chaise,\r\nwhich was entered by the butler. The rest of the body and wheels were\r\nforthwith changed into go-carts, and ran away with by the nurses and\r\nbrats of the rest of the family. What makes these misfortunes in the\r\naffairs of Timon the more astonishing, is, that he has a better\r\nunderstanding than those who cheat him; so that a man knows not which\r\nmore to wonder at, the indifference of the master, or the impudence of\r\nthe servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhite's Chocolate-house, April 29.\r\n\r\nIt is matter of much speculation among the beaux and oglers, what it is\r\nthat can have made so sudden a change, as has been of late observed, in\r\nthe whole behaviour of Pastorella, who never sat still a moment till she\r\nwas eighteen, which she has now exceeded by two months. Her aunt, who\r\nhas the care of her, has not been always so rigid as she is at this\r\npresent date; but has so good a sense of the frailty of woman, and\r\nfalsehood of man, that she resolved on all manner of methods to keep\r\nPastorella, if possible, in safety, against herself, and all her\r\nadmirers. At the same time the good lady knew by long experience, that\r\na gay inclination, curbed too rashly, would but run to the greater\r\nexcesses for that restraint: therefore intended to watch her, and take\r\nsome opportunity of engaging her insensibly in her own interests,\r\nwithout the anguish of an admonition. You are to know then, that miss,\r\nwith all her flirting and ogling, had also naturally a strong curiosity\r\nin her, and was the greatest eavesdropper breathing. Parisatis (for so\r\nher prudent aunt is called) observed this humour, and retires one day to\r\nher closet, into which she knew Pastorella would peep, and listen to\r\nknow how she was employed. It happened accordingly, and the young lady\r\nsaw her good governante on her knees, and after a mental behaviour,\r\nbreak into these words: \"As for the dear child committed to my care, let\r\nher sobriety of carriage, and severity of behaviour, be such, as may\r\nmake that noble lord, who is taken with her beauty, turn his designs to\r\nsuch as are honourable.\" Here Parisatis heard her niece nestle closer to\r\nthe keyhole: she then goes on; \"Make her the joyful mother of a numerous\r\nand wealthy offspring, and let her carriage be such, as may make this\r\nnoble youth expect the blessings of an happy marriage, from the\r\nsingularity of her life, in this loose and censorious age.\" Miss having\r\nheard enough, sneaks off for fear of discovery, and immediately at her\r\nglass, alters the sitting of her head; then pulls up her tucker,[160]\r\nand forms herself into the exact manner of Lindamira: in a word, becomes\r\na sincere convert to everything that's commendable in a fine young lady;\r\nand two or three such matches as her aunt feigned in her devotions, are\r\nat this day in her choice. This is the history and original cause of\r\nPastorella's conversion from coquetry. The prudence in the management\r\nof this young lady's temper, and good judgment of it, is hardly to be\r\nexceeded. I scarce remember a greater instance of forbearance of the\r\nusual peevish way with which the aged treat the young, than this, except\r\nthat of our famous Noye,[161] whose good nature went so far, as to make\r\nhim put off his admonitions to his son, even till after his death; and\r\ndid not give him his thoughts of him, till he came to read that\r\nmemorable passage in his will: \"All the rest of my estate,\" says he, \"I\r\nleave to my son Edward (who is executor to this my will) to be\r\nsquandered as he shall think fit: I leave it him for that purpose, and\r\nhope no better from him.\" A generous disdain and reflection, upon how\r\nlittle he deserved from so excellent a father, reformed the young man,\r\nand made Edward, from an errant rake, become a fine gentleman.\r\n\r\n\r\nSt. James's Coffee-house, April 29.\r\n\r\nLetters from Portugal of the 18th instant, dated from Estremos, say,\r\nthat on the 6th the Earl of Galway arrived at that place, and had the\r\nsatisfaction to see the quarters well furnished with all manner of\r\nprovisions, and a quantity of bread sufficient for subsisting the troops\r\nfor sixty days, besides biscuits for twenty-five days. The enemy give\r\nout, that they shall bring into the field 14 regiments of horse, and 24\r\nbattalions. The troops in the service of Portugal will make up 14,000\r\nfoot, and 4000 horse. On the day these letters were despatched, the\r\nEarl of Galway received advice, that the Marquis de Bay was preparing\r\nfor some enterprise, by gathering his troops together on the frontiers.\r\nWhereupon his Excellency resolved to go that same night to Villa-Vicosa,\r\nto assemble the troops in that neighbourhood, in order to disappoint his\r\ndesigns.\r\n\r\nYesterday in the evening Captain Foxon, aide-de-camp to Major-General\r\nCadogan, arrived here express from the Duke of Marlborough. And this day\r\na mail is come in, with letters dated from Brussels of the 6th of May,\r\nN.S., which advise, that the enemy had drawn together a body, consisting\r\nof 20,000 men, with a design, as was supposed, to intercept the great\r\nconvoy on the march towards Lille, which was safely arrived at Menin and\r\nCourtray, in its way to that place, the French having retired without\r\nmaking any attempt.\r\n\r\nWe hear from the Hague, that a person of the first quality is arrived in\r\nthe Low Countries from France, in order to be a plenipotentiary in an\r\nensuing treaty of peace.\r\n\r\nLetters from France acknowledge, that Monsieur Bernard has made no\r\nhigher offers of satisfaction to his creditors than of £35 per cent.\r\n\r\nThese advices add, that the Marshal Boufflers, Monsieur Torcy (who\r\ndistinguished himself formerly, by advising the Court of France to\r\nadhere to the treaty of partition), and Monsieur d'Harcourt (who\r\nnegotiated with Cardinal Portocarrero for the succession of the crown of\r\nSpain in the House of Bourbon), are all three joined in a commission for\r\na treaty of peace. The Marshal is come to Ghent: the other two are\r\narrived at the Hague.\r\n\r\nIt is confidently reported here that the Right Honourable the Lord\r\nTownshend is to go with his Grace the Duke of Marlborough into\r\nHolland.[162]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 152: Congreve's first play, produced in 1693.

[STEELE.\r\n\r\nBy Mrs.[163] JENNY DISTAFF, half-sister to Mr. BICKERSTAFF.\r\n\r\nFrom _Saturday, April 30_, to _Tuesday, May 3_, 1709.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom my own Apartment, May 1.\r\n\r\nMy brother Isaac having a sudden occasion to go out of town, ordered me\r\nto take upon me the despatch of the next advices from home, with liberty\r\nto speak it my own way; not doubting the allowances which would be given\r\nto a writer of my sex. You may be sure I undertook it with much\r\nsatisfaction, and I confess, I am not a little pleased with the\r\nopportunity of running over all the papers in his closet, which he has\r\nleft open for my use on this occasion. The first that I lay my hands on,\r\nis, a treatise concerning \"The Empire of Beauty,\" and the effects it\r\nhas had in all nations of the world, upon the public and private actions\r\nof men; with an appendix, which he calls, \"The Bachelor's Scheme for\r\nGoverning his Wife.\" The first thing he makes this gentleman propose,\r\nis, that she shall be no woman; for she is to have an aversion to balls,\r\nto operas, to visits: she is to think his company sufficient to fill up\r\nall the hours of life with great satisfaction: she is never to believe\r\nany other man wise, learned, or valiant; or at least but in a second\r\ndegree. In the next place, he intends she shall be a cuckold; but\r\nexpects, that he himself must live in perfect security from that terror.\r\nHe dwells a great while on instructions for her discreet behaviour, in\r\ncase of his falsehood. I have not patience with these unreasonable\r\nexpectations, therefore turn back to the treatise itself. Here, indeed,\r\nmy brother deduces all the revolutions among men from the passion of\r\nlove; and in his preface, answers that usual observation against us,\r\nthat there is no quarrel without a woman in it, with a gallant\r\nassertion, that there is nothing else worth quarrelling for. My brother\r\nis of a complexion truly amorous; all his thoughts and actions carry in\r\nthem a tincture of that obliging inclination; and this turn has opened\r\nhis eyes to see, we are not the inconsiderable creatures which unlucky\r\npretenders to our favour would insinuate. He observes that no man begins\r\nto make any tolerable figure, till he sets out with the hopes of\r\npleasing some one of us. No sooner he takes that in hand, but he pleases\r\nevery one else by-the-bye. It has an immediate effect upon his\r\nbehaviour. There is Colonel Ranter, who never spoke without an oath,\r\ntill he saw the Lady Betty Modish;[164] now never gives his man an\r\norder, but it is, \"Pray, Tom, do it.\" The drawers where he drinks live\r\nin perfect happiness. He asked Will at the \"George\" the other day how he\r\ndid? Where he used to say, \"Damn it, it is so,\" he now believes there is\r\nsome mistake: he must confess, he is of another opinion; but however he\r\nwon't insist.\r\n\r\nEvery temper, except downright insipid, is to be animated and softened\r\nby the influence of beauty: but of this untractable sort is a lifeless\r\nhandsome fellow that visits us, whom I have dressed at this twelvemonth;\r\nbut he is as insensible of all the arts I use, as if he conversed all\r\nthat time with his nurse. He outdoes our whole sex in all the faults our\r\nenemies impute to us; he has brought laziness into an opinion, and makes\r\nhis indolence his philosophy: insomuch, that no longer ago than\r\nyesterday in the evening he gave me this account of himself: \"I am,\r\nmadam, perfectly unmoved at all that passes among men, and seldom give\r\nmyself the fatigue of going among them; but when I do, I always appear\r\nthe same thing to those whom I converse with. My hours of existence, or\r\nbeing awake, are from eleven in the morning to eleven at night; half of\r\nwhich I live to myself, in picking my teeth, washing my hands, paring my\r\nnails, and looking in the glass. The insignificancy of my manners to the\r\nrest of the world makes the laughers call me a _quidnunc_, a phrase I\r\nshall never inquire what they mean by it. The last of me each night is\r\nat St. James's Coffee-house, where I converse, yet never fall into a\r\ndispute on any occasion, but leave the understanding I have, passive of\r\nall that goes through it, without entering into the business of life.\r\nAnd thus, madam, have I arrived by laziness, to what others pretend to\r\nby devotion, a perfect neglect of the world.\" Sure, if our sex had the\r\nliberty of frequenting public-houses and conversations, we should put\r\nthese rivals of our faults and follies out of countenance. However, we\r\nshall soon have the pleasure of being acquainted with them one way or\r\nother, for my brother Isaac designs, for the use of our sex, to give the\r\nexact characters of all the chief politicians who frequent any of the\r\ncoffee-houses from St. James's to the Change; but designs to begin with\r\nthat cluster of wise heads, as they are found sitting every evening,\r\nfrom the left side of the fire, at the Smyrna,[165] to the door. This\r\nwill be of great service for us, and I have authority to promise an\r\nexact journal of their deliberations; the publication of which I am to\r\nbe allowed for pin-money. In the meantime, I cast my eye upon a new\r\nbook, which gave me a more pleasing entertainment, being a sixth part of\r\n\"Miscellany Poems,\" published by Jacob Tonson,[166] which I find, by my\r\nbrother's notes upon it, no way inferior to the other volumes. There\r\nare, it seems, in this, a collection of the best pastorals that have\r\nhitherto appeared in England; but among them, none superior to that\r\ndialogue between Sylvia and Dorinda, written by one of my own sex,[167]\r\nwhere all our little weaknesses are laid open in a manner more just,\r\nand with, truer raillery than ever man yet hit upon.\r\n\r\n    _Only this I now discern.\r\n    From the things thou'st have me learn;\r\n    That womankind's peculiar joys\r\n    From past or present beauties rise._\r\n\r\nBut to reassume my first design, there cannot be a greater instance of\r\nthe command of females, than in the prevailing charms of the heroine in\r\nthe play which was acted this night, called \"All for Love; or, The World\r\nWell Lost.\"[168] The enamoured Antony resigns glory and power to the\r\nforce of the attractive Cleopatra, whose charms were the defence of her\r\ndiadem, against a people otherwise invincible. It is so natural for\r\nwomen to talk of themselves, that it is to be hoped all my own sex, at\r\nleast, will pardon me, that I could fall into no other discourse. If we\r\nhave their favour, we give ourselves very little anxiety for the rest of\r\nour readers. I believe I see a sentence of Latin in my brother's\r\nday-book of wit, which seems applicable on this occasion, and in\r\ncontempt of the critics.\r\n\r\n      --_Tristitiam et metus\r\n    Tradam protectis in mare Criticum\r\n    Portare ventis._[169]\r\n\r\nBut I am interrupted by a packet from Mr. Kidney,[170] from the St.\r\nJames's Coffee-house, which I am obliged to insert in the very style and\r\nwords which Mr. Kidney uses in his letter.\r\n\r\n\r\nSt. James's Coffee-house, May 2.\r\n\r\nWe are advised by letters from Berne, dated the 1st instant, N.S., that\r\nthe Duke of Berwick arrived at Lyons the 25th of the last month, and\r\ncontinued his journey the next day to visit the passes of the mountains,\r\nand other posts in Dauphine and Provence. These letters also informed\r\nus, that the miseries of the people in France are heightened to that\r\ndegree, that unless a peace be speedily concluded, half of that kingdom\r\nwould perish for want of bread. On the 24th, the Marshal de Thesse\r\npassed through Lyons, in his way to Versailles; and two battalions,\r\nwhich were marching from Alsace to reinforce the army of the Duke of\r\nBerwick, passed also through that place. Those troops were to be\r\nfollowed by six Battalions more.\r\n\r\nLetters from Naples of the 16th of April say, that the Marquis de Prie's\r\nson was arrived there, with instructions from his father, to signify to\r\nthe viceroy the necessity his Imperial Majesty was under, of desiring an\r\naid from that kingdom, for carrying on the extraordinary expenses of the\r\nwar. On the 14th of the same month, they made a review of the Spanish\r\ntroops in that garrison, and afterwards of the marines; one part of whom\r\nwill embark with those designed for Barcelona, and the rest are to be\r\nsent on board the galleys appointed to convoy provisions to that place.\r\n\r\nWe hear from Rome, by letters dated the 20th of April, that the Count de\r\nMellos, envoy from the King of Portugal, had made his public entry into\r\nthat city with much state and magnificence. The Pope has lately held two\r\nother consistories, wherein he made a promotion of two cardinals; but\r\nthe acknowledgment of King Charles is still deferred.\r\n\r\nLetters from other parts of Italy advise us, that the Doge of Venice\r\ncontinues dangerously ill: that the Prince de Carignan, having relapsed\r\ninto a violent fever, died the 23rd of April, in his 80th year.\r\n\r\nAdvices from Vienna of the 27th of April import, that the Archbishop of\r\nSaltzburg is dead, who is succeeded by Count Harrach, formerly Bishop of\r\nVienna, and for these last three years coadjutor to the said Archbishop;\r\nand that Prince Maximilian of Lichtenstein has likewise departed this\r\nlife, at his country seat called Cromaw in Moravia. These advices add,\r\nthat the Emperor has named Count Zinzendorf, Count Goes, and Monsieur\r\nConsbruck, for his plenipotentiaries in an ensuing treaty of peace; and\r\nthey hear from Hungary, that the Imperialists have had several\r\nsuccessful skirmishes with the malcontents.\r\n\r\nLetters from Paris, dated May the 6th, say, that the Marshal de Thesse\r\narrived there on the 29th of the last month; and that the Chevalier de\r\nBeuil was sent thither by Don Pedro Ronquillo with advice, that the\r\nconfederate squadron appeared before Alicante the 17th, and having for\r\nsome time cannonaded the city, endeavoured to land some troops for the\r\nrelief of the castle; but General Stanhope finding the passes well\r\nguarded, and the enterprise dangerous, demanded to capitulate for the\r\ncastle; which being granted him, the garrison, consisting of 600 regular\r\ntroops, marched out with their arms and baggage the day following; and\r\nbeing received on board, they immediately set sail for Barcelona. These\r\nletters add, that the march of the French and Swiss regiments is further\r\ndeferred for a few days; and that the Duke of Noailles was just ready to\r\nset out for Roussillon, as well as the Count de Bezons for Catalonia.\r\n\r\nThe same advices say, bread was sold at Paris for 6d. per pound; and\r\nthat there was not half enough, even at that rate, to supply the\r\nnecessities of the people, which reduced them to the utmost despair;\r\nthat 300 men had taken up arms, and having plundered the market of the\r\nsuburb St. Germain, pressed down by their multitude the King's Guards\r\nwho opposed them. Two of those mutineers were afterwards seized, and\r\ncondemned to death; but four others went to the magistrate who\r\npronounced that sentence, and told him, he must expect to answer with\r\nhis own life for those of their comrades. All order and sense of\r\ngovernment being thus lost among the enraged people, to keep up a show\r\nof authority, the captain of the Guards, who saw all their insolence,\r\npretended, that he had represented to the King their deplorable\r\ncondition, and had obtained their pardon. It is further reported, that\r\nthe Dauphin and Duchess of Burgundy, as they went to the Opera, were\r\nsurrounded by crowds of people, who upbraided them with their neglect of\r\nthe general calamity, in going to diversions, when the whole people were\r\nready to perish for want of bread. Edicts are daily published to\r\nsuppress these riots, and papers, with menaces against the Government,\r\nare publicly thrown about. Among others, these words were dropped in a\r\ncourt of justice: \"France wants a Ravilliac or a Jesuit to deliver her.\"\r\nBesides this universal distress, there is a contagious sickness, which,\r\nit is feared, will end in a pestilence. Letters from Bordeaux bring\r\naccounts no less lamentable: the peasants are driven by hunger from\r\ntheir abodes into that city, and make lamentations in the streets\r\nwithout redress.\r\n\r\nWe are advised by letters from the Hague, dated the 10th instant, N.S.,\r\nthat on the 6th, the Marquis de Torcy arrived there from Paris; but the\r\npassport, by which he came, having been sent blank by Monsieur Rouillé,\r\nhe was there two days before his quality was known. That Minister\r\noffered to communicate to Monsieur Heinsius the proposals which he had\r\nto make; but the pensionary refused to see them, and said, he would\r\nsignify it to the States, who deputed some of their own body to acquaint\r\nhim, That they would enter into no negotiation till the arrival of his\r\nGrace the Duke of Marlborough, and the other Ministers of the Alliance.\r\nPrince Eugene was expected there the 12th instant from Brussels. It is\r\nsaid, that besides Monsieur de Torcy and Monsieur Pajot,\r\nDirector-general of the Posts, there are two or three persons at the\r\nHague whose names are not known; but it is supposed that the Duke\r\nd'Alba, ambassador from the Duke of Anjou, was one of them. The States\r\nhave sent letters to all the cities of the Provinces, desiring them to\r\nsend their deputies to receive the propositions of peace made by the\r\nCourt of France.[171]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 163: The word \"Miss\" was still confined, in Steele's day, to\r\nvery young girls or to young women of giddy or doubtful character. Thus\r\nPastorella in No. 9 is called \"Miss,\" and similarly we find \"Miss Gruel\"\r\nin No. 33. In the \"Original Letters to the _Tatler_ and _Spectator_,\"\r\nprinted by Charles Lillie (i. 223) there is a \"Table of the Titles and\r\nDistinctions of Women,\" from which what follows is extracted. \"Let all\r\ncountry-gentlewomen, without regard to more or less fortune, content\r\nthemselves with being addressed by the style of 'Mrs.' Let 'Madam'\r\ngovern independently in the city, &c. Let no women after the known age\r\nof 21 presume to admit of her being called 'Miss,' unless she can fairly\r\nprove she is not out of her sampler. Let every common maid-servant be\r\nplain 'Jane,' 'Doll,' or 'Sue,' and let the better-born and\r\nhigher-placed be distinguished by 'Mrs. Patience,' 'Mrs. Prue,' or 'Mrs.\r\nAbigail.'\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 164: Perhaps there is here an illusion to Mrs. Anne Oldfield\r\n(died 1730), and Brigadier-General Charles Churchill, brother of the\r\nDuke of Marlborough.

[STEELE.\r\n\r\nBy ISAAC BICKERSTAFF, Esq.\r\n\r\nFrom _Tuesday May 3,_ to _Thursday, May 5_, 1709.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nWill's Coffee-house, May 3.\r\n\r\nA kinsman[172] has sent me a letter, wherein he informs me, he had\r\nlately resolved to write an heroic poem, but by business had been\r\ninterrupted, and has only made one similitude, which he should be\r\nafflicted to have wholly lost, and begs of me to apply it to something,\r\nbeing very desirous to see it well placed in the world. I am so willing\r\nto help the distressed, that I have taken it in; but though his greater\r\ngenius might very well distinguish his verses from mine, I have marked\r\nwhere his begin. His lines are a description of the sun in eclipse,\r\nwhich I know nothing more like than a brave man in sorrow, who bears it\r\nas he should, without imploring the pity of his friends, or being\r\ndejected with the contempt of his enemies. As in the case of Cato:\r\n\r\n    When all the globe to Cæsar's fortune bowed,\r\n    Cato alone his empire disallowed;\r\n    With inborn strength alone opposed mankind,\r\n    With heaven in view, to all below it blind:\r\n    Regardless of his friend's applause, or moan,\r\n    Alone triumphant, since he falls alone.\r\n\r\n    \"Thus when the Ruler of the genial day,\r\n    Behind some darkening planet forms his way,\r\n    Desponding mortals, with officious care,\r\n    The concave drum, and magic brass prepare;\r\n    Implore him to sustain the important fight,\r\n    And save depending worlds from endless night.\r\n    Fondly they hope their labour may avail,\r\n    To ease his conflict, and assist his toil.\r\n    Whilst he in beams of native splendour bright, }\r\n    (Though dark his orb appear to human sight)    }\r\n    Shines to the gods with more diffusive light.  }\r\n    To distant stars with equal glory burns,\r\n    Inflames their lamps, and feeds their golden urns.\r\n    Sure to retain his known superior tract,\r\n    And proves the more illustrious by defect.\"\r\n\r\nThis is a very lively image; but I must take the liberty to say, my\r\nkinsman drives the sun a little like Phaëton: he has all the warmth of\r\nPhœbus, but won't stay for his direction of it. Avail and toil, defect\r\nand tract, will never do for rhymes. But, however, he has the true\r\nspirit in him; for which reason I was willing to entertain anything he\r\npleased to send me. The subject which he writes upon, naturally raises\r\ngreat reflections in the soul, and puts us in mind of the mixed\r\ncondition which we mortals are to support; which, as it varies to good\r\nor bad, adorns or defaces our actions to the beholders: All which glory\r\nand shame must end in what we so much repine at, death. But doctrines on\r\nthis occasion, any other than that of living well, are the most\r\ninsignificant and most empty of all the labours of men. None but a\r\ntragedian can die by rule, and wait till he discovers a plot, or says a\r\nfine thing upon his exit. In real life, this is a chimera; and by noble\r\nspirits, it will be done decently, without the ostentation of it. We see\r\nmen of all conditions and characters go through it with equal\r\nresolution: and if we consider the speeches of the mighty philosophers,\r\nheroes, law-givers, and great captains, they can produce no more in a\r\ndiscerning spirit, than rules to make a man a fop on his death-bed.\r\nCommend me to that natural greatness of soul, expressed by an innocent,\r\nand consequently resolute, country fellow, who said in the pains of the\r\ncolic, \"If I once get this breath out of my body, you shall hang me\r\nbefore you put it in again.\" Honest Ned! and so he died.[173]\r\n\r\nBut it is to be supposed, from this place you may expect an account of\r\nsuch a thing as a new play is not to be omitted. That acted this night\r\nis the newest that ever was writ. The author is my ingenious friend Mr.\r\nThomas D----y. The drama is called, \"The Modern Prophets,\"[174] and is a\r\nmost unanswerable satire against the late spirit of enthusiasm. The\r\nwriter had by long experience observed, that in company, very grave\r\ndiscourses have been followed by bawdry; and therefore has turned the\r\nhumour that way with great success, and taken from his audience all\r\nmanner of superstition, by the agitations of pretty Mrs. Bignell,[175]\r\nwhom he has, with great subtlety, made a lay-sister, as well as a\r\nprophetess; by which means, she carries on the affairs of both worlds\r\nwith great success. My friend designs to go on with another work against\r\nwinter, which he intends to call, \"The Modern Poets\"; a people no less\r\nmistaken in their opinions of being inspired than the other. In order to\r\nthis, he has by him seven songs, besides many ambiguities, which cannot\r\nbe mistaken for anything but what he means them. Mr. D----y generally\r\nwrites state-plays, and is wonderfully useful to the world in such\r\nrepresentations. This method is the same that was used by old Athenians,\r\nto laugh out of countenance, or promote opinions among the people. My\r\nfriend has therefore, against this play is acted for his own benefit,\r\nmade two dances, which may be also of an universal benefit. In the first\r\nhe has represenced absolute power, in the person of a tall man with a\r\nhat and feather, who gives his first minister, that stands just before\r\nhim, a huge kick: the minister gives the kick to the next before; and so\r\nto the end of the stage. In this moral and practical jest, you are made\r\nto understand, that there is, in an absolute government, no\r\ngratification, but giving the kick you receive from one above you to one\r\nbelow you. This is performed to a grave and melancholy air; but on a\r\nsudden the tune moves quicker, and the whole company fall into a circle\r\nand take hands; then, at a certain sharp note, they move round, and kick\r\nas kick can. This latter performance he makes to be the representation\r\nof a free state; where, if you all mind your steps, you may go round and\r\nround very jollily, with a motion pleasant to yourselves and those you\r\ndance with: nay, if you put yourselves out, at the worst you only kick,\r\nand are kicked, like friends and equals.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom my own Apartment, May 4.\r\n\r\nOf all the vanities under the sun, I confess, that of being proud of\r\none's birth is the greatest. At the same time, since in this\r\nunreasonable age, by the force of prevailing custom, things in which men\r\nhave no hand are imputed to them; and that I am used by some people, as\r\nif Isaac Bickerstaff, though I write myself \"Esquire,\" was nobody: to\r\nset the world right in that particular, I shall give you my genealogy,\r\nas a kinsman of ours has sent it me from the Heralds' Office. It is\r\ncertain, and observed by the wisest writers, that there are women who\r\nare not nicely chaste, and men not severely honest in all families;\r\ntherefore let those who may be apt to raise aspersions upon ours, please\r\nto give us as impartial an account of their own, and we shall be\r\nsatisfied. The business of heralds is a matter of so great nicety, that\r\nto avoid mistakes, I shall give you my cousin's letter verbatim, without\r\naltering a syllable.[176]\r\n\r\n\"DEAR COUSIN,\r\n\r\n\"Since you have been pleased to make yourself so famous of late, by your\r\ningenious writings, and some time ago by your learned Predictions: since\r\nPartridge, of immortal memory, is dead and gone, who, poetical as he\r\nwas, could not understand his own poetry; and philomathical as he was,\r\ncould not read his own destiny: since the Pope, the King of France, and\r\ngreat part of his Court, are either literally or metaphorically defunct:\r\nsince, I say, these things (not foretold by any one but yourself) have\r\ncome to pass after so surprising a manner; it is with no small concern I\r\nsee the original of the Staffian race so little known in the world as it\r\nis at this time; for which reason, as you have employed your studies in\r\nastronomy and the occult sciences, so I, my mother being a Welsh woman,\r\ndedicated mine to genealogy, particularly that of our own family, which,\r\nfor its antiquity and number, may challenge any in Great Britain. The\r\nStaffs are originally of Staffordshire, which took its name from them:\r\nthe first that I find of the Staffs was one Jacobstaff, a famous and\r\nrenowned astronomer, who by Dorothy his wife, had issue seven sons;\r\nviz., Bickerstaff, Longstaff, Wagstaff, Quarterstaff, Whitestaff,\r\nFalstaff, and Tipstaff. He also had a younger brother who was twice\r\nmarried, and had five sons; viz., Distaff, Pikestaff, Mopstaff,\r\nBroomstaff, and Raggedstaff. As for the branch from whence you spring,\r\nI shall say very little of it, only that it is the chief of the Staffs,\r\nand called Bickerstaff, _quasi_ Biggerstaff; as much as to say, the\r\ngreat staff, or staff of staffs; and that it has applied itself to\r\nastronomy with great success, after the example of our aforesaid\r\nforefather. The descendants from Longstaff, the second son, were a\r\nrakish disorderly sort of people, and rambled from one place to another,\r\ntill in Harry II.'s time they settled in Kent, and were called\r\nLong-tails, from the long tails which were sent them as a punishment for\r\nthe murder of Thomas-à-Becket, as the legends say; they have been always\r\nsought after by the ladies; but whether it be to show their aversion to\r\npopery, or their love to miracles, I can't say. The Wagstaffs are a\r\nmerry thoughtless sort of people, who have always been opinionated of\r\ntheir own wit; they have turned themselves mostly to poetry. This is the\r\nmost numerous branch of our family, and the poorest. The Quarterstaffs\r\nare most of them prize-fighters or deer-stealers. There have been so\r\nmany of them hanged lately, that there are very few of that branch of\r\nour family left. The Whitestaffs[177] are all courtiers, and have had\r\nvery considerable places: there have been some of them of that strength\r\nand dexterity, that five hundred of the ablest men in the kingdom[178]\r\nhave often tugged in vain to pull a staff out of their hands. The\r\nFalstaffs are strangely given to whoring and drinking: there are\r\nabundance of them in and about London. And one thing is very remarkable\r\nof this branch, and that is, there are just as many women as men in it.\r\nThere was a wicked stick of wood of this name in Harry IV.'s time, one\r\nSir John Falstaff. As for Tipstaff, the youngest son, he was an honest\r\nfellow; but his sons, and his sons' sons, have all of them been the\r\nveriest rogues living: it is this unlucky branch has stocked the nation\r\nwith that swarm of lawyers, attorneys, serjeants, and bailiffs, with\r\nwhich the nation is overrun. Tipstaff, being a seventh son, used to cure\r\nthe king's evil; but his rascally descendants are so far from having\r\nthat healing quality, that by a touch upon the shoulder, they give a man\r\nsuch an ill habit of body, that he can never come abroad afterwards.\r\nThis is all I know of the line of Jacobstaff: his younger brother\r\nIsaacstaff, as I told you before, had five sons, and was married twice;\r\nhis first wife was a Staff (for they did not stand upon false heraldry\r\nin those days), by whom he had one son, who in process of time, being a\r\nschoolmaster, and well read in the Greek, called himself Distaff or\r\nTwicestaff: he was not very rich, so he put his children out to trades;\r\nand the Distaffs have ever since been employed in the woollen and linen\r\nmanufactures, except myself, who am a genealogist. Pikestaff, the eldest\r\nson by the second venter, was a man of business, a downright plodding\r\nfellow, and withal so plain, that he became a proverb. Most of this\r\nfamily are at present in the army. Raggedstaff was an unlucky boy, and\r\nused to tear his clothes getting birds' nests, and was always playing\r\nwith a tame bear his father kept. Mopstaff fell in love with one of his\r\nfather's maids, and used to help her to clean the house. Broomstaff was\r\na chimney-sweeper. The Mopstaffs and Broomstaffs are naturally as civil\r\npeople as ever went out of doors; but alas! if they once get into ill\r\nhands, they knock down all before them. Pilgrimstaff run away from his\r\nfriends, and went strolling about the country: and Pipestaff was a\r\nwine-cooper. These two were the unlawful issue of Longstaff.\r\n\r\n\"N.B. The Canes, the Clubs, the Cudgels, the Wands, the Devil upon two\r\nSticks, and one Bread, that goes by the name of Staff of Life, are none\r\nof our relations.\r\n\r\n\"I am, dear Cousin,\r\n\r\n\"Your humble Servant,\r\n\r\n                                        \"D.

The present grandeur of the British nation might\r\nmake us expect, that we should rise in our public diversions, and manner\r\nof enjoying life, in proportion to our advancement in glory and power.\r\nInstead of that, take and survey this town, and you'll find, rakes and\r\ndebauchees are your men of pleasure; thoughtless atheists, and\r\nilliterate drunkards, call themselves free thinkers; and gamesters,\r\nbanterers, biters,[180] swearers, and twenty new-born insects more, are,\r\nin their several species, the modern men of wit. Hence it is, that a man\r\nwho has been out of town but one half-year, has lost the language, and\r\nmust have some friend to stand by him, and keep him in countenance for\r\ntalking common sense. To-day I saw a short interlude at White's of this\r\nnature, which I took notes of, and put together as well as I could in a\r\npublic place. The persons of the drama are, Pip, the last gentleman that\r\nhas been made so at cards; Trimmer, a person half undone at them, and is\r\nnow between a cheat and a gentleman; Acorn, an honest Englishman, of\r\ngood plain sense and meaning; and Mr. Friendly, a reasonable man of the\r\ntown.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhite's Chocolate-house, May 5.\r\n\r\n[_Enter_ PIP, TRIM, _and_ ACORN.\r\n\r\nAC. What's the matter, gentlemen? What! Take no notice of an old friend?\r\n\r\nPIP. Pox on it! don't talk to me, I am voweled by the Count, and\r\ncursedly out of humour.\r\n\r\nAC. Voweled! Prithee, Trimmer, what does he mean by that?\r\n\r\nTRIM. Have a care, Harry, speak softly; don't show your ignorance:--If\r\nyou do, they'll bite you where-e'er they meet you; they are such cursed\r\ncurs,--the present wits.\r\n\r\nAC. Bite me! What do you mean?\r\n\r\nPIP. Why! Don't you know what biting is? Nay, you are in the right on\r\nit. However, one would learn it only to defend oneself against men of\r\nwit, as one would know the tricks of play, to be secure against the\r\ncheats. But don't you hear, Acorn, that report, that some potentates of\r\nthe Alliance have taken care of themselves, exclusive of us?\r\n\r\nAC. How! Heaven forbid! After all our glorious victories; all this\r\nexpense of blood and treasure!\r\n\r\nPIP. Bite--\r\n\r\nAC. Bite! How?\r\n\r\nTRIM. Nay, he has bit you fairly enough; that's certain.\r\n\r\nAC. Pox! I don't feel it--how? Where?\r\n\r\n[_Exit_ PIP _and_ TRIMMER, _laughing._\r\n\r\nAC. Ho! Mr. Friendly, your most humble servant; you heard what passed\r\nbetween those fine gentlemen and me. Pip complained to me, that he has\r\nbeen voweled; and they tell me, I am bit.\r\n\r\nFRIEND. You are to understand, sir, that simplicity of behaviour, which\r\nis the perfection of good breeding and good sense, is utterly lost in\r\nthe world; and in the room of it, there are started a thousand little\r\ninventions, which men, barren of better things, take up in the place of\r\nit. Thus, for every character in conversation that used to please, there\r\nis an impostor put upon you. Him whom we allowed formerly for a certain\r\npleasant subtilty, and natural way of giving you an unexpected hit,\r\ncalled a droll, is now mimicked by a biter, who is a dull fellow, that\r\ntells you a lie with a grave face, and laughs at you for knowing him no\r\nbetter than to believe him. Instead of that sort of companion, who could\r\nrally you, and keep his countenance, till he made you fall into some\r\nlittle inconsistency of behaviour, at which you yourself could laugh\r\nwith him, you have the sneerer, who will keep you company from morning\r\nto night, to gather your follies of the day (which perhaps you commit\r\nout of confidence in him), and expose you in the evening to all the\r\nscorners in town. For your man of sense and free spirit, whose set of\r\nthoughts were built upon learning, reason, and experience, you have now\r\nan impudent creature made up of vice only, who supports his ignorance by\r\nhis courage, and want of learning by contempt of it.\r\n\r\nAC. Dear sir, hold: what you have told me already of this change in\r\nconversation, is too miserable to be heard with any delight; but,\r\nmethinks, as these new creatures appear in the world, it might give an\r\nexcellent field to writers for the stage, to divert us with the\r\nrepresentation of them there.\r\n\r\nFRIEND. No, no: as you say, there might be some hopes of redress of\r\nthese grievances, if there were proper care taken of the theatre; but\r\nthe history of that is yet more lamentable than that of the decay of\r\nconversation I gave you.\r\n\r\nAC. Pray, sir, a little: I haven't been in town these six years, till\r\nwithin this fortnight.\r\n\r\nFRIEND. It is now some years since several revolutions in the gay world\r\nhad made the empire of the stage subject to very fatal convulsions,\r\nwhich were too dangerous to be cured by the skill of little King\r\nOberon,[181] who then sat in the throne of it. The laziness of this\r\nprince threw him upon the choice of a person who was fit to spend his\r\nlife in contentions, an able and profound attorney, to whom he mortgaged\r\nhis whole empire. This Divito[182] is the most skilful of all\r\npoliticians: he has a perfect art in being unintelligible in discourse,\r\nand uncomeatable in business. But he having no understanding in this\r\npolite way, brought in upon us, to get in his money,\r\nladder-dancers,[183] rope-dancers, jugglers, and mountebanks, to strut\r\nin the place of Shakespeare's heroes, and Jonson's humorists. When the\r\nseat of wit was thus mortgaged, without equity of redemption, an\r\narchitect[184] arose, who has built the muse a new palace, but secured\r\nher no retinue; so that instead of action there, we have been put off\r\nby song and dance. This latter help of sound has also begun to fail for\r\nwant of voices; therefore the palace has since been put into the hands\r\nof a surgeon,[185] who cuts any foreign fellow into an eunuch, and\r\npasses him upon us for a singer of Italy.\r\n\r\nAC. I'll go out of town to-morrow.\r\n\r\nFRIEND.[186] Things are come to this pass; and yet the world will not\r\nunderstand, that the theatre has much the same effect on the manners of\r\nthe age, as the bank on the credit of the nation. Wit and spirit, humour\r\nand good sense, can never be revived, but under the government of those\r\nwho are judges of such talents, who know, that whatever is put up in\r\ntheir stead, is but a short and trifling expedient, to support the\r\nappearance of them for a season. It is possible, a peace will give\r\nleisure to put these matters under new regulations; but at present, all\r\nthe assistance we can see towards our recovery, is as far from giving us\r\nhelp, as a poultice is from performing what can be done only by the\r\nGrand Elixir.\r\n\r\n\r\nWill's Coffee-house, May 6.\r\n\r\nAccording to our late design in the applauded verses on the\r\nMorning,[187] which you lately had from hence, we proceed to improve\r\nthat just intention, and present you with other labours, made proper to\r\nthe place in which they were written. The following poem comes from\r\nCopenhagen, and is as fine a winter-piece as we have ever had from any\r\nof the schools of the most learned painters. Such images as these give\r\nus a new pleasure in our sight, and fix upon our minds traces of\r\nreflection, which accompany us whenever the like objects occur. In\r\nshort, excellent poetry and description dwell upon us so agreeably, that\r\nall the readers of them are made to think, if not write, like men of\r\nwit. But it would be injury to detain you longer from this excellent\r\nperformance, which is addressed to the Earl of Dorset by Mr.\r\nPhilips,[188] the author of several choice poems in Mr. Tonson's new\r\nMiscellany.[189]\r\n\r\n                                            _Copenhagen, March 9_, 1709.\r\n    From frozen climes, and endless tracks of snow,\r\n    From streams that northern winds forbid to flow;\r\n    What present shall the muse to Dorset bring;\r\n    Or how, so near the Pole, attempt to sing?\r\n    The hoary winter here conceals from sight\r\n    All pleasing objects that to verse invite.\r\n    The hills and dales, and the delightful woods,\r\n    The flowery plains, and silver streaming floods,\r\n    By snow disguised, in bright confusion lie,\r\n    And with one dazzling waste fatigue the eye.\r\n\r\n    No gentle breathing breeze prepares the spring,\r\n    No birds within the desert region sing.\r\n    The ships unmoved the boisterous winds defy,\r\n    While rattling chariots o'er the ocean fly.\r\n    The vast leviathan wants room to play,\r\n    And spout his waters in the face of day.\r\n    The starving wolves along the main sea prowl,\r\n    And to the moon in icy valleys howl.\r\n    For many a shining league the level main\r\n    Here spreads itself into a glassy plain:\r\n    There solid billows of enormous size,\r\n    Alps of green ice, in wild disorder rise.\r\n\r\n    And yet but lately have I seen e'en here,\r\n    The winter in a lovely dress appear;\r\n    Ere yet the clouds let fall the treasured snow,\r\n    Or winds begun through hazy skies to blow.\r\n    At evening a keen eastern breeze arose;\r\n    And the descending rain unsullied froze.\r\n    Soon as the silent shades of night withdrew,\r\n    The ruddy morn disclosed at once to view\r\n    The face of nature in a rich disguise,\r\n    And brightened every object to my eyes.\r\n    For every shrub, and every blade of grass,\r\n    And every pointed thorn, seemed wrought in glass,\r\n    In pearls and rubies rich the hawthorns show,\r\n    While through the ice the crimson berries glow.\r\n    The thick-sprung reeds the watery marshes yield,\r\n    Seem polished lances in a hostile field.\r\n    The stag in limpid currents with surprise,\r\n    Sees crystal branches on his forehead rise.\r\n    The spreading oak, the beech, and towering pine,\r\n    Glazed over, in the freezing ether shine.\r\n    The frighted birds the rattling branches shun,\r\n    That wave and glitter in the distant sun.\r\n\r\n    When if a sudden gust of wind arise,\r\n    The brittle forest into atoms flies:\r\n    The crackling wood beneath the tempest bends,\r\n    And in a spangled shower the prospect ends.\r\n    Or if a southern gale the region warm,\r\n    And by degrees unbind the wintry charm;\r\n    The traveller a miry country sees,\r\n    And journeys sad beneath the dropping trees.\r\n\r\n    Like some deluded peasant, Merlin leads\r\n    Through fragrant bowers, and through delicious meads;\r\n    While here enchanted gardens to him rise,\r\n    And airy fabrics there attract his eyes,\r\n    His wandering feet the magic paths pursue;\r\n    And while he thinks the fair illusion true,\r\n    The trackless scenes disperse in fluid air,\r\n    And woods and wilds, and thorny ways appear:\r\n    A tedious road the weary wretch returns,\r\n    And, as he goes, the transient vision mourns.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom my own Apartment, May 6.\r\n\r\nThere has a mail this day arrived from Holland; but the matter of the\r\nadvices importing rather what gives us great expectations, than any\r\npositive assurances, I shall, for this time, decline giving you what I\r\nknow, and apply the following verses of Mr. Dryden, in the second part\r\nof \"Almanzor,\" to the present circumstances of things, without\r\ndiscovering what my knowledge in astronomy suggests to me.\r\n\r\n    _When empire in its childhood first appears,\r\n    A watchful fate o'er sees its tender years:\r\n    Till grown more strong, it thrusts and stretches out,\r\n    And elbows all the kingdoms round about.\r\n    The place thus made for its first breathing free,\r\n    It moves again for ease and luxury;\r\n    Till swelling by degrees it has possest\r\n    The greater space, and now crowds up the rest.\r\n    When from behind there starts some petty state,\r\n    And pushes on its now unwieldy fate.\r\n    Then down the precipice of time it goes,\r\n    And sinks in minutes, which in ages rose._[190]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 180: \"I'll teach you a way to outwit Mrs. Johnson; it is a\r\nnew-fashioned way of being witty, and they call it a _bite_. You must\r\nask a bantering question, or tell some damned lie in a serious manner,\r\nthen she will answer, or speak as if you were in earnest, and then cry\r\nyou, 'Madam, there's a _bite_.' I would not have you undervalue this,\r\nfor it is the constant amusement in Court, and everywhere else among the\r\ngreat people; and I let you know it, in order to have it obtain among\r\nyou, and to teach you a new refinement\" (Swift's \"Journal\"). See the\r\n_Spectator_, Nos. 47, 504: \"_A Biter_ is one who tells you a thing you\r\nhave no reason to disbelieve in itself; and perhaps has given you,\r\nbefore he bit you, no reason to disbelieve it for his saying it; and if\r\nyou give him credit, laughs in your face, and triumphs that he has\r\ndeceived you.

[STEELE.\r\n\r\nFrom _Saturday, May 7_, to _Tuesday, May 10_, 1709.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom my own Apartment, May 8.\r\n\r\nMuch hurry and business had to-day perplexed me into a mood too\r\nthoughtful for going into company; for which reason, instead of the\r\ntavern, I went into Lincoln's Inn Walks; and having taken a round or\r\ntwo, I sat down, according to the allowed familiarity of these places,\r\non a bench; at the other end of which sat a venerable gentleman, who\r\nspeaking with a very affable air, \"Mr. Bickerstaff,\" said he, \"I take it\r\nfor a very great piece of good fortune, that you have found me out.\"\r\n\"Sir,\" said I, \"I had never, that I know of, the honour of seeing you\r\nbefore.\" \"That,\" replied he, \"is what I have often lamented; but I\r\nassure you, I have for many years done you good offices, without being\r\nobserved by you; or else, when you had any little glimpse of my being\r\nconcerned in an affair, you have fled from me, and shunned me like an\r\nenemy; but however, the part I am to act in the world is such, that I am\r\nto go on in doing good, though I meet with never so many repulses, even\r\nfrom those I oblige.\" This, thought I, shows a great good nature, but\r\nlittle judgment in the persons upon whom he confers his favours. He\r\nimmediately took notice to me, that he observed by my countenance I\r\nthought him indiscreet in his beneficence, and proceeded to tell me his\r\nquality in the following manner: \"I know thee, Isaac, to be so well\r\nversed in the occult sciences, that I need not much preface, or make\r\nlong preparations to gain your faith that there are airy beings, who are\r\nemployed in the care and attendance of men, as nurses are to infants,\r\ntill they come to an age in which they can act of themselves. These\r\nbeings are usually called amongst men, guardian angels; and, Mr.\r\nBickerstaff, I am to acquaint you, that I am to be yours for some time\r\nto come; it being our orders to vary our stations, and sometimes to have\r\none patient under our protection, and sometimes another, with a power of\r\nassuming what shape we please, to ensnare our wards into their own good.\r\nI have of late been upon such hard duty, and know you have so much work\r\nfor me, that I think fit to appear to you face to face, to desire you\r\nwould give me as little occasion for vigilance as you can.\" \"Sir,\" said\r\nI, \"it will be a great instruction to me in my behaviour, if you please\r\nto give me some account of your late employments, and what hardships or\r\nsatisfactions you have had in them, that I may govern myself\r\naccordingly.\" He answered: \"To give you an example of the drudgery we go\r\nthrough, I will entertain you only with my three last stations: I was on\r\nthe 1st of April last, put to mortify a great beauty, with whom I was a\r\nweek; from her I went to a common swearer, and have been last with a\r\ngamester. When I first came to my lady, I found my great work was to\r\nguard well her eyes and ears; but her flatterers were so numerous, and\r\nthe house, after the modern way, so full of looking-glasses, that I\r\nseldom had her safe but in her sleep. Whenever we went abroad, we were\r\nsurrounded by an army of enemies: when a well-made man appeared, he was\r\nsure to have a side-glance of observation: if a disagreeable fellow, he\r\nhad a full face, out of mere inclination to conquests. But at the close\r\nof the evening, on the sixth of the last month, my ward was sitting on a\r\ncouch, reading Ovid's 'Epistles'; and as she came to this line of Helen\r\nto Paris,\r\n\r\n    _She half consents who silently denies;_[191]\r\n\r\nentered Philander,[192] who is the most skilful of all men in an address\r\nto women. He is arrived at the perfection of that art which gains them,\r\nwhich is, to talk like a very miserable man, but look like a very happy\r\none. I saw Dictinna blush at his entrance, which gave me the alarm; but\r\nhe immediately said something so agreeable on her being at study, and\r\nthe novelty of finding a lady employed in so grave a manner, that he on\r\na sudden became very familiarly a man of no consequence; and in an\r\ninstant laid all her suspicions of his skill asleep, as he almost had\r\ndone mine, till I observed him very dangerously turn his discourse upon\r\nthe elegance of her dress, and her judgment in the choice of that very\r\npretty mourning. Having had women before under my care, I trembled at\r\nthe apprehension of a man of sense, who could talk upon trifles, and\r\nresolved to stick to my post with all the circumspection imaginable. In\r\nshort, I prepossessed her against all he could say to the advantage of\r\nher dress and person; but he turned again the discourse, where I found I\r\nhad no power over her, on the abusing her friends and acquaintance. He\r\nallowed indeed, that Flora had a little beauty, and a great deal of wit;\r\nbut then she was so ungainly in her behaviour, and such a laughing\r\nhoyden--Pastorella had with him the allowance of being blameless: but\r\nwhat was that towards being praiseworthy? To be only innocent, is not to\r\nbe virtuous. He afterwards spoke so much against Mrs. Dipple's forehead,\r\nMrs. Prim's mouth, Mrs. Dentifrice's teeth, and Mrs. Fidget's cheeks,\r\nthat she grew downright in love with him: for it is always to be\r\nunderstood, that a lady takes all you detract from the rest of her sex\r\nto be a gift to her. In a word, things went so far, that I was\r\ndismissed, and she will remember that evening nine months, from the 6th\r\nof April, by a very remarkable token. The next, as I said, I went to was\r\na common swearer: never was creature so puzzled as myself when I came\r\nfirst to view his brain; half of it was worn out, and filled up with\r\nmere expletives, that had nothing to do with any other parts of the\r\ntexture; therefore, when he called for his clothes in a morning, he\r\nwould cry, 'John--?' John does not answer. 'What a plague! Nobody there?\r\nWhat the devil, and rot me! John, for a lazy dog as you are.' I knew no\r\nway to cure him, but by writing down all he said one morning as he was\r\ndressing, and laying it before him on the toilet when he came to pick\r\nhis teeth. The last recital I gave him of what he said for half an hour\r\nbefore, was, 'What, a pox rot me! Where is the washball? Call the\r\nchairmen: damn them, I warrant they are at the ale-house already!\r\nZounds, and confound them.' When he came to the glass, he takes up my\r\nnote--'Ha! this fellow is worse than me: what, does he swear with pen\r\nand ink?' But reading on, he found them to be his own words. The\r\nstratagem had so good an effect upon him, that he grew immediately a new\r\nman, and is learning to speak without an oath, which makes him extremely\r\nshort in his phrases; for, as I observed before, a common swearer has a\r\nbrain without any idea on the swearing side; therefore my ward has yet\r\nmighty little to say, and is forced to substitute some other vehicle of\r\nnonsense to supply the defect of his usual expletives. When I left him,\r\nhe made use of, 'Oddsbodikins!' 'Oh me!' and, 'Never stir alive!' and so\r\nforth; which gave me hopes of his recovery. So I went to the next I told\r\nyou of, the gamester. When we first take our place about a man, the\r\nreceptacles of the pericranium are immediately searched. In his, I found\r\nno one ordinary trace of thinking; but strong passion, violent desires,\r\nand a continued series of different changes, had torn it to pieces.\r\nThere appeared no middle condition; the triumph of a prince, or the\r\nmisery of a beggar, were his alternate states. I was with him no longer\r\nthan one day, which was yesterday. In the morning at twelve, we were\r\nworth four thousand pounds; at three, we were arrived at six thousand;\r\nhalf an hour after, we were reduced to one thousand; at four of the\r\nclock, we were down to two hundred; at five, to fifty; at six, to five;\r\nat seven, to one guinea; the next bet, to nothing: this morning, he\r\nborrowed half a crown of the maid who cleans his shoes; and is now\r\ngaming in Lincoln's Inn Fields among the boys for farthings and oranges,\r\ntill he has made up three pieces, and then he returns to White's into\r\nthe best company in town.\" This ended our first discourse; and it is\r\nhoped, you will forgive me, that I have picked so little out of my\r\ncompanion at our first interview. In the next, it is possible he may\r\ntell me more pleasing incidents; for though he is a familiar, he is not\r\nan evil spirit.\r\n\r\n\r\nSt. James's Coffee-house, May 9.\r\n\r\nWe hear from the Hague of the 14th instant, N.S., that Monsieur de Torcy\r\nhath had frequent conferences with the Grand Pensioner, and the other\r\nMinisters who were heretofore commissioned to treat with Monsieur\r\nRouillé. The preliminaries of a peace are almost settled, and the\r\nproceedings wait only for the arrival of the Duke of Marlborough; after\r\nwhose approbation of the articles proposed, it is not doubted but the\r\nmethods of the treaty will be publicly known. In the meantime, the\r\nStates have declared an abhorrence of making any step in this great\r\naffair, but in concert with the Court of Great Britain, and other\r\nprinces of the Alliance. The posture of affairs in France does\r\nnecessarily oblige that nation to be very much in earnest in their\r\noffers; and Monsieur de Torcy hath professed to the Grand Pensioner,\r\nthat he will avoid all occasions of giving him the least jealousy of his\r\nusing any address in private conversations for accomplishing the ends of\r\nhis embassy. It is said, that as soon as the preliminaries are adjusted,\r\nthat Minister is to return to the French Court. The States of Holland\r\nhave resolved to make it an instruction to all their men-of-war and\r\nprivateers, to bring into their ports whatever neutral ships they shall\r\nmeet with laden with corn, and bound for France; and to avoid all cause\r\nof complaint from the potentates to whom these ships shall belong, their\r\nfull demand for their freight shall be paid them there. The French\r\nProtestants residing in that country have applied themselves to their\r\nrespective magistrates, desiring that there may be an article in the\r\ntreaty of peace, which may give liberty of conscience to the Protestants\r\nin France. Monsieur Bosnage, minister of the Walloon church at\r\nRotterdam, has been at the Hague and hath had some conferences with the\r\ndeputies of the States on that subject. It is reported there, that all\r\nthe French refugees in those dominions are to be naturalised, that they\r\nmay enjoy the same good effects of the treaty with the Hollanders\r\nthemselves, in respect of France.\r\n\r\nLetters from Paris say, the people conceive great hopes of a sudden\r\npeace, from Monsieur Torcy's being employed in the negotiation, he being\r\na Minister of too great weight in that Court, to be sent on any\r\nemployment in which his master would not act in a manner wherein he\r\nmight justly promise himself success. The French advices add, that there\r\nis an insurrection in Poictou; 3000 men having taken up arms, and beaten\r\nthe troops which were appointed to disperse them: three of the mutineers\r\nbeing taken, were immediately executed; and as many of the king's party\r\nwere used after the same manner.\r\n\r\nOur late Act of Naturalisation[193] hath had so great an effect in\r\nforeign parts, that some princes have prohibited the French refugees in\r\ntheir dominions to sell or transfer their estates to any other of their\r\nsubjects; and at the same time have granted them greater immunities than\r\nthey hitherto enjoyed. It has been also thought necessary to restrain\r\ntheir own subjects from leaving their native country, on pain of death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 191: Ovid's \"Epistles,\" 1709; translation of \"Helen's Epistle\r\nto Paris,\" by the Earl of Mulgrave and Dryden.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 192: An original for Philander has been found in Lord Halifax.\r\nSee No. 49.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 193: See No. 9. \"If the Whigs were now restored to power, the\r\nbill [for a general naturalisation] now to be repealed, would then be\r\nre-enacted, and the birthright of an Englishman reduced again to the\r\nvalue of twelve pence.\"--(_Examiner_, vol. i.

[STEELE.\r\n\r\nFrom _Tuesday May 10_, to _Thursday, May 12_, 1709.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom my own Apartment, May 10.\r\n\r\nHad it not been that my familiar had appeared to me, as I told you in my\r\nlast, in person, I had certainly been unable to have found even words,\r\nwithout meaning, to keep up my intelligence with the town: but he has\r\nchecked me severely for my despondence, and ordered me to go on in my\r\ndesign of observing upon things, and forbearing persons; \"for,\" said he,\r\n\"the age you live in is such, that a good picture of any vice or virtue\r\nwill infallibly be misrepresented; and though none will take the kind\r\ndescriptions you make so much to themselves, as to wish well to the\r\nauthor, yet all will resent the ill characters you produce, out of fear\r\nof their own turn in the licence you must be obliged to take, if you\r\npoint at particular persons.\" I took his admonition kindly, and\r\nimmediately promised him to beg pardon of the author of the \"Advice to\r\nthe Poets,\"[194] for my raillery upon his work; though I aimed at no\r\nmore in that examination, but to convince him, and all men of genius, of\r\nthe folly of laying themselves out on such plans as are below their\r\ncharacters. I hope too it was done without ill-breeding, and nothing\r\nspoken below what a civilian (as it is allowed I am) may utter to a\r\nphysician. After this preface, all the world may be safe from my\r\nwritings; for if I can find nothing to commend, I am silent, and will\r\nforbear the subject: for, though I am a reformer, I scorn to be an\r\ninquisitor.\r\n\r\nIt would become all men, as well as me, to lay before them the noble\r\ncharacter of Verus the magistrate,[195] who always sat in triumph over,\r\nand contempt of, vice; he never searched after it, or spared it when it\r\ncame before him: at the same time, he could see through the hypocrisy\r\nand disguise of those, who have no pretence to virtue themselves, but by\r\ntheir severity to the vicious. This same Verus was, in times long past,\r\nchief justice (as we call it amongst us) in Fælicia.[196] He was a man\r\nof profound knowledge of the laws of his country, and as just an\r\nobserver of them in his own person. He considered justice as a cardinal\r\nvirtue, not as a trade for maintenance. Wherever he was judge, he never\r\nforgot that he was also counsel. The criminal before him was always sure\r\nhe stood before his country, and, in a sort, a parent of it. The\r\nprisoner knew, that though his spirit was broken with guilt, and\r\nincapable of language to defend itself, all would be gathered from him\r\nwhich could conduce to his safety; and that his judge would wrest no law\r\nto destroy him, nor conceal any that could save him. In his time, there\r\nwere a nest of pretenders to justice, who happened to be employed to put\r\nthings in a method for being examined before him at his usual sessions:\r\nthese animals were to Verus, as monkeys are to men, so like, that you\r\ncan hardly disown them; but so base, that you are ashamed of their\r\nfraternity. It grew a phrase, \"Who would do justice on the justices?\"\r\nThat certainly would Verus. I have seen an old trial where he sat judge\r\non two of them; one was called Trick-Track, the other Tearshift;[197]\r\none was a learned judge of sharpers, the other the quickest of all men\r\nat finding out a wench. Trick-Track never spared a pickpocket, but was a\r\ncompanion to cheats: Tearshift would make compliments to wenches of\r\nquality, but certainly commit poor ones. If a poor rogue wanted a\r\nlodging, Trick-Track sent him to gaol for a thief: if a poor whore went\r\nonly with one thin petticoat, Tearshift would imprison her for being\r\nloose in her dress. These patriots infested the days of Verus, while\r\nthey alternately committed and released each other's prisoners. But\r\nVerus regarded them as criminals, and always looked upon men as they\r\nstood in the eye of justice, without respecting whether they sat on the\r\nbench, or stood at the bar.\r\n\r\n\r\nWill's Coffee-house, May 11\r\n\r\nYesterday we were entertained with the tragedy of \"The Earl of\r\nEssex,\"[198] in which there is not one good line, and yet a play which\r\nwas never seen without drawing tears from some part of the audience: a\r\nremarkable instance, that the soul is not to be moved by words, but\r\nthings; for the incidents in this drama are laid together so happily,\r\nthat the spectator makes the play for himself, by the force which the\r\ncircumstance has upon his imagination. Thus, in spite of the most dry\r\ndiscourses, and expressions almost ridiculous with respect to propriety,\r\nit is impossible for one unprejudiced to see it untouched with pity. I\r\nmust confess, this effect is not wrought on such as examine why they are\r\npleased; but it never fails to appear on those who are not too learned\r\nin nature, to be moved by her first suggestions. It is certain, the\r\nperson and behaviour of Mr. Wilks[199] has no small share in conducing\r\nto the popularity of the play; and when a handsome fellow is going to a\r\nmore coarse exit than beheading, his shape and countenance make every\r\ntender one reprieve him with all her heart, without waiting till she\r\nhears his dying words.\r\n\r\nThis evening \"The Alchemist\"[200] was played. This comedy is an example\r\nof Ben's extensive genius and penetration into the passions and follies\r\nof mankind. The scene in the fourth act, where all the cheated people\r\noppose the man that would open their eyes, has something in it so\r\ninimitably excellent, that it is certainly as great a masterpiece as has\r\never appeared by any hand. The author's great address in showing\r\ncovetousness the motive of the actions of the Puritan, the epicure, the\r\ngamester, and the trader; and that all their endeavours, how differently\r\nsoever they seem to tend, centre only in that one point of gain, shows\r\nhe had to a great perfection, that discernment of spirit, which\r\nconstitutes a genius for comedy.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhite's Chocolate-house, May 11.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be imagined how far the violence of our desires will carry\r\nus towards our own deceit in the pursuit of what we wish for. A\r\ngentleman here this evening was giving me an account of a dumb\r\nfortune-teller,[201] who outdoes Mr. Partridge, myself, or the\r\nunborn-doctor,[202] for predictions. All his visitants come to him full\r\nof expectations, and pay his own rate for the interpretations they put\r\nupon his shrugs and nods. There is a fine rich City widow stole thither\r\nthe other day (though it is not six weeks since her husband's departure\r\nfrom her company to rest), and, with her trusty maid, demanded of him,\r\nwhether she should marry again, by holding up two fingers, like horns on\r\nher forehead. The wizard held up both his hands forked. The relict\r\ndesired to know, whether he meant by his holding up both hands, to\r\nrepresent that she had one husband before, and that she should have\r\nanother? Or that he intimated, she should have two more? The cunning-man\r\nlooked a little sour; upon which Betty jogged her mistress, who gave the\r\nother guinea; and he made her understand, she should positively have two\r\nmore; but shaked his head, and hinted, that they should not live long\r\nwith her. The widow sighed, and gave him the other half-guinea. After\r\nthis prepossession, all that she had next to do, was to make sallies to\r\nour end of the town, and find out who it is her fate to have. There are\r\ntwo who frequent this place, whom she takes for men of vogue, and of\r\nwhom her imagination has given her the choice. They are both the\r\nappearances of fine gentlemen, to such as do not know when they see\r\npersons of that turn; and indeed, they are industrious enough to come at\r\nthat character, to deserve the reputation of being such: but this town\r\nwill not allow us to be the things we seem to aim at, and are too\r\ndiscerning to be fobbed off with pretences. One of these pretty fellows\r\nfails by his laborious exactness; the other, by his as much studied\r\nnegligence. Frank Careless, as soon as his valet has helped on and\r\nadjusted his clothes, goes to his glass, sets his wig awry, tumbles his\r\ncravat; and in short, undresses himself to go into company. Will Nice is\r\nso little satisfied with his dress, that all the time he is at a visit,\r\nhe is still mending it, and is for that reason the more insufferable;\r\nfor he who studies carelessness, has, at least, his work the sooner done\r\nof the two. The widow is distracted whom to take for her first man; for\r\nNice is every way so careful, that she fears his length of days; and\r\nFrank is so loose, that she has apprehensions for her own health with\r\nhim. I am puzzled how to give a just idea of them; but in a word,\r\nCareless is a coxcomb, and Nice a fop: both, you'll say, very hopeful\r\ncandidates for a gay woman just set at liberty. But there is a whisper,\r\nher maid will give her to Tom Terrour the gamester. This fellow has\r\nundone so many women, that he'll certainly succeed if he is introduced;\r\nfor nothing so much prevails with the vain part of that sex, as the\r\nglory of deceiving them who have deceived others.\r\n\r\n    _Desunt multa_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSt. James's Coffee-house, May 11.\r\n\r\nLetters from Berlin, bearing date May 11, N.S., inform us, that the\r\nbirthday of her Prussian Majesty has been celebrated there with all\r\npossible magnificence; and the king made her on that occasion a present\r\nof jewels to the value of thirty thousand crowns. The Marquis de Quesne,\r\nwho has distinguished himself by his great zeal for the Protestant\r\ninterest, was, at the time of the despatch of these letters, at that\r\nCourt, soliciting the king to take care, that an article in behalf of\r\nthe refugees, admitting their return to France, should be inserted in\r\nthe treaty of peace. They write from Hanover of the 14th, that his\r\nelectoral highness had received an express from Count Merci,\r\nrepresenting how necessary it was to the common cause, that he would\r\nplease to hasten to the Rhine; for that nothing but his presence could\r\nquicken the measures towards bringing the imperial army into the field.\r\nThere are very many speculations upon the intended interview of the King\r\nof Denmark and King Augustus. The latter has made such preparations for\r\nthe reception of the other, that it is said his Danish Majesty will be\r\nentertained in Saxony with much more elegance than he met with in Italy\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nLetters from the Hague of the 18th instant, N.S., say, that his Grace\r\nthe Duke of Marlborough landed the night before at the Brill, after\r\nhaving been kept out at sea by adverse winds two days longer than is\r\nusual in that passage. His Excellency the Lord Townshend, her Majesty's\r\nambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary to the States-General, was\r\ndriven into the Veere in Zealand on Thursday last, from whence he came\r\nto the Hague within few hours after the arrival of his grace. The duke,\r\nsoon after his coming to the Hague, had a visit from the Pensioner of\r\nHolland. All things relating to the peace were in suspense till this\r\ninterview; nor is it yet known what resolutions will be taken on that\r\nsubject; for the troops of the Allies have fresh orders despatched to\r\nthem to move from their respective quarters, and march with all\r\nexpedition to the frontiers, where the enemy are making their utmost\r\nefforts for the defence of their country. These advices further inform\r\nus, that the Marquis de Torcy had received an answer from the Court of\r\nFrance to his letters which he had sent thither by an express on the\r\nFriday before.\r\n\r\nMr. Bickerstaff has received letters from Mr. Coltstaff, Mr. Whipstaff,\r\nand Mrs. Rebecca Wagstaff; all which relate chiefly to their being left\r\nout in the genealogy of the family lately published;[203] but my cousin\r\nbeing a clerk in the Heralds' Office who writ that draught, and being at\r\npresent under the displeasure of the chapter, it is feared, if that\r\nmatter should be touched upon at this time, the young gentleman would\r\nlose his place for treason against the Kings at Arms.[204]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 194: Sir Richard Blackmore. See No. 3.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 195: Sir John Holt (see _Examiner_, vol. iv. No. 14) was born\r\nin 1642, made Recorder of London and knighted in 1686, and appointed\r\nChief Justice of the King's Bench in 1689, a position which he filled\r\nvery ably and impartially for twenty-one years.

C---- and\r\nMr. C----r.\" Who the latter was I do not know; the former appears to be\r\nmeant for Sir Henry Colt, of whom Luttrell gives some particulars. In\r\nApril 1694, a Bill was found against Sir Henry Colt and Mr. Lake, son to\r\nthe late Bishop of Chichester, for fighting a duel in St. James's Park;\r\nthe trial was to be on May 31. Sir Henry Colt, a Justice of the Peace,\r\nhad a duel with Beau Feilding on the 11th January, 1696, and Colt was\r\nrun through the body. A reward of £200 was offered for Feilding's\r\narrest, and he was captured in March; but in the following month he was\r\nset at liberty upon Colt promising not to prosecute. In July 1698, Colt\r\nunsuccessfully contested Westminster, and in December the Committee of\r\nPrivileges decided that his petition against the return of Mr.\r\nChancellor Montague and Mr. Secretary Vernon was vexatious, frivolous\r\nand scandalous; and Colt was put out of the commission of the peace for\r\nWestminster and Middlesex. In 1701, he became M.P. for Westminster, for\r\none Parliament only. In August 1702, he was again displaced from being a\r\nJustice for Westminster. In July 1708, he was defeated at Westminster,\r\nand the petition which he lodged against Mr. Medlicot's election was\r\ndismissed, after Huggins, the head bailiff, had been examined.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 198: By John Banks, 1685.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 199: Robert Wilks died in 1732, age 62.

Several other books\r\nabout Campbell appeared, and some said that he only pretended to be deaf\r\nand dumb. Campbell had a very large number of clients (_Spectator_, No.\r\n560).

He is wonderfully skilful in the knowledge of men and\r\nmanners, which has made me more than ordinary curious to know how he\r\ncame to that perfection, and I communicated to him that doubt. \"Mr.\r\nPacolet,\" said I, \"I am mightily surprised to see you so good a judge of\r\nour nature and circumstances, since you are a mere spirit, and have no\r\nknowledge of the bodily part of us.\" He answered, smiling, \"You are\r\nmistaken, I have been one of you, and lived a month amongst you, which\r\ngives me an exact sense of your condition. You are to know, that all who\r\nenter into human life, have a certain date or stamen given to their\r\nbeing, which they only who die of age may be said to have arrived at;\r\nbut it is ordered sometimes by fate, that such as die infants, are after\r\ndeath to attend mankind to the end of that stamen of being in\r\nthemselves, which was broke off by sickness or any other disaster. These\r\nare proper guardians to men, as being sensible of the infirmity of their\r\nstate. You are philosopher enough to know, that the difference of men's\r\nunderstanding proceeds only from the various dispositions of their\r\norgans; so that he who dies at a month old, is in the next life as\r\nknowing (though more innocent) as they who live to fifty; and after\r\ndeath, they have as perfect a memory and judgment of all that passed in\r\ntheir lifetime, as I have of all the revolutions in that uneasy,\r\nturbulent condition of yours; and, you'd say, I had enough of it in a\r\nmonth, were I to tell you all my misfortunes.\" \"A life of a month, can't\r\nhave, one would think, much variety; but pray,\" said I, \"let us have\r\nyour story.\"\r\n\r\nThen he proceeds in the following manner:\r\n\r\n\"It was one of the most wealthy families in Great Britain into which I\r\nwas born, and it was a very great happiness to me that it so happened,\r\notherwise I had still, in all probability, been living: but I shall\r\nrecount to you all the occurrences of my short and miserable existence,\r\njust as, by examining into the traces made in my brain, they appeared\r\nto me at that time. The first thing that ever struck my senses, was a\r\nnoise over my head of one shrieking; after which, methought I took a\r\nfull jump, and found myself in the hands of a sorceress, who seemed as\r\nif she had been long waking and employed in some incantation: I was\r\nthoroughly frightened, and cried out, but she immediately seemed to go\r\non in some magical operation, and anointed me from head to foot. What\r\nthey meant I could not imagine; for there gathered a great crowd about\r\nme, crying, 'An heir, an heir'; upon which I grew a little still, and\r\nbelieved this was a ceremony to be used only to great persons, and such\r\nas made them, what they called, Heirs. I lay very quiet; but the witch,\r\nfor no manner of reason or provocation in the world, takes me and binds\r\nmy head as hard as possibly she could, then ties up both my legs, and\r\nmakes me swallow down a horrid mixture; I thought it a harsh entrance\r\ninto life to begin with taking physic; but I was forced to it, or else\r\nmust have taken down a great instrument in which she gave it me. When I\r\nwas thus dressed, I was carried to a bedside, where a fine young lady\r\n(my mother I wot) had like to have hugged me to death. From her, they\r\nfaced me about, and there was a thing with quite another look from the\r\nrest of the room, to whom they talked about my nose. He seemed\r\nwonderfully pleased to see me; but I knew since, my nose belonged to\r\nanother family. That into which I was born, is one of the most numerous\r\namongst you; therefore crowds of relations came every day to\r\ncongratulate my arrival; among others, my cousin Betty, the greatest\r\nromp in nature; she whisks me such a height over her head, that I cried\r\nout for fear of falling. She pinched me, and called me squealing chit,\r\nand threw me into a girl's arms that was taken in to tend me. The girl\r\nwas very proud of the womanly employment of a nurse, and took upon her\r\nto strip and dress me anew, because I made a noise, to see what ailed\r\nme: she did so, and stuck a pin in every joint about me. I still cried:\r\nupon which, she lays me on my face in her lap; and to quiet me, fell a\r\nnailing in all the pins, by clapping me on the back, and screaming a\r\nlullaby. But my pain made me exalt my voice above hers, which brought up\r\nthe nurse, the witch I first saw, and my grandmother. The girl is turned\r\ndown stairs, and I stripped again, as well to find out what ailed me, as\r\nto satisfy my granam's further curiosity. This good old woman's visit\r\nwas the cause of all my troubles. You are to understand, that I was\r\nhitherto bred by hand, and anybody that stood next, gave me pap, if I\r\ndid but open my lips; insomuch, that I was grown so cunning, as to\r\npretend myself asleep when I was not, to prevent my being crammed. But\r\nmy grandmother began a loud lecture upon the idleness of the wives of\r\nthis age, who, for fear of their shape, forbear suckling their own\r\noffspring; and ten nurses were immediately sent for; one was whispered\r\nto have a wanton eye, and would soon spoil her milk; another was in a\r\nconsumption; the third had an ill voice, and would frighten me, instead\r\nof lulling me to sleep. Such exceptions were made against all but one\r\ncountry milch-wench, to whom I was committed, and put to the breast.\r\nThis careless jade was eternally romping with the footmen, and downright\r\nstarved me; insomuch that I daily pined away, and should never have been\r\nrelieved, had it not been, that on the thirtieth day of my life, a\r\nfellow of the Royal Society,[205] who had writ upon Cold Baths, came to\r\nvisit me, and solemnly protested, I was utterly lost for want of that\r\nmethod: upon which he soused me head and ears into a pail of water,\r\nwhere I had the good fortune to be drowned, and so escaped being lashed\r\ninto a linguist till sixteen, running after wenches till twenty-five,\r\nand being married to an ill-natured wife till sixty: which had certainly\r\nbeen my fate, had not the enchantment between body and soul been broke\r\nby this philosopher. Thus, till the age I should have otherwise lived, I\r\nam obliged to watch the steps of men; and if you please, shall accompany\r\nyou in your present walks, and get you intelligence from the aërial\r\nlackey, who is in waiting, what are the thoughts and purposes of any\r\nwhom you inquire for.\" I accepted his kind offer, and immediately took\r\nhim with me in a hack to White's.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhite's Chocolate-house, May 13.\r\n\r\nWe got in hither, and my companion threw a powder round us, that made me\r\nas invisible as himself; so that we could see and hear all others;\r\nourselves unseen and unheard.\r\n\r\nThe first thing we took notice of, was a nobleman of a goodly and frank\r\naspect, with his generous birth and temper visible in it, playing at\r\ncards with a creature of a black and horrid countenance, wherein were\r\nplainly delineated the arts of his mind, cozenage and falsehood. They\r\nwere marking their game with counters, on which we could see\r\ninscriptions, imperceptible to any but us. My lord had scored with\r\npieces of ivory, on which were writ, Good Fame, Glory, Riches, Honour,\r\nand Posterity. The spectre over against him had on his counters the\r\ninscriptions of, Dishonour, Impudence, Poverty, Ignorance, and Want of\r\nShame. \"Bless me!\" said I, \"sure my lord does not see what he plays\r\nfor!\" \"As well as I do,\" says Pacolet. \"He despises that fellow he\r\nplays with, and scorns himself for making him his companion.\" At the\r\nvery instant he was speaking, I saw the fellow who played with my lord,\r\nhide two cards in the roll of his stocking: Pacolet immediately stole\r\nthem from thence; upon which the nobleman soon after won the game. The\r\nlittle triumph he appeared in, when he got such a trifling stock of\r\nready money, though he had ventured so great sums with indifference,\r\nincreased my admiration. But Pacolet began to talk to me. \"Mr. Isaac,\r\nthis to you looks wonderful, but not at all to us higher beings: that\r\nnoble has as many good qualities as any man of his order, and seems to\r\nhave no faults but what, as I may say, are excrescences from virtues: he\r\nis generous to a prodigality, more affable than is consistent with his\r\nquality, and courageous to a rashness. Yet, after all this, the source\r\nof his whole conduct is (though he would hate himself if he knew it)\r\nmere avarice. The ready cash laid before the gamester's counters makes\r\nhim venture, as you see, and lay distinction against infamy, abundance\r\nagainst want; in a word, all that's desirable against all that's to be\r\navoided.\" \"However,\" said I, \"be sure you disappoint the sharpers\r\nto-night, and steal from them all the cards they hide.\" Pacolet obeyed\r\nme, and my lord went home with their whole bank in his pocket.\r\n\r\n\r\nWill's Coffee-house, May 13.\r\n\r\nTo-night was acted a second time a comedy, called \"The Busy Body:\"[206]\r\nthis play is written by a lady. In old times, we used to sit upon a play\r\nhere after it was acted; but now the entertainment is turned another\r\nway; not but there are considerable men appear in all ages, who, for\r\nsome eminent quality or invention, deserve the esteem and thanks of the\r\npublic. Such a benefactor is a gentleman of this house, who is observed\r\nby the surgeons with much envy; for he has invented an engine for the\r\nprevention of harms by love adventures, and by great care and\r\napplication, hath made it an immodesty to name his name. This act of\r\nself-denial has gained this worthy member of the commonwealth a great\r\nreputation. Some lawgivers have departed from their abodes for ever, and\r\ncommanded the observation of their laws till their return; others have\r\nused other artifices to fly the applause of their merit; but this person\r\nshuns glory with greater address, and has, by giving his engine his own\r\nname, made it obscene to speak of him more. However, he is ranked among,\r\nand received by the modern wits, as a great promoter of gallantry and\r\npleasure. But I fear, pleasure is less understood in this age, which so\r\nmuch pretends to it, than in any since the creation. It was admirably\r\nsaid of him who first took notice, that (_res est severa voluptas_)\r\nthere is a certain severity in pleasure. Without that, all decency is\r\nbanished; and if reason is not to be present at our greatest\r\nsatisfactions, of all the races of creatures, the human is the most\r\nmiserable. It was not so of old; when Virgil describes a wit, he always\r\nmeans a virtuous man; and all his sentiments of men of genius are such\r\nas show persons distinguished from the common level of mankind; such as\r\nplaced happiness in the contempt of low fears, and mean gratifications:\r\nfears, which we are subject to with the vulgar; and pleasures, which we\r\nhave in common with beasts. With these illustrious personages, the\r\nwisest man was the greatest wit; and none was thought worthy of that\r\ncharacter, unless he answered this excellent description of the poet:\r\n\r\n    _Qui--metus omnes et inexorabile fatum\r\n    Subjecit pedibus, strepitumque Acherontis avari._[207]\r\n\r\n\r\nSt. James's Coffee-house, May 13.\r\n\r\nWe had this morning advice, that some English merchant-ships, convoyed\r\nby the _Bristol_ of fifty-four guns, were met with by a part of Mons. du\r\nGuy Trouin's squadron, who engaged the convoy. That ship defended itself\r\ntill the English merchants got clear of the enemy, but being disabled\r\nwas herself taken. Within few hours after, my Lord Dursley[208] came up\r\nwith part of his squadron and engaging the French, retook the _Bristol_\r\n(which being very much shattered, sunk), and took the _Glorieux_, a ship\r\nof forty-four guns, as also a privateer of fourteen. Before this action,\r\nhis lordship had taken two French merchant-men; and had, at the despatch\r\nof these advices, brought the whole safe into Plymouth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 205: Probably William Oliver, M.D., F.R.S., who published a\r\nDissertation on Bath waters, and cold baths, in 1709 (_Flying Post_,\r\nFeb. 10 to 12, 1709).

[STEELE.\r\n\r\nFrom _Saturday, May 14_, to _Tuesday, May 17_, 1709.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nWhite's Chocolate-house, May 15.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas,[209] of this house, has shown me some letters from the Bath,\r\nwhich give accounts of what passes among the good company of that place;\r\nand allowed me to transcribe one of them, that seems to be writ by some\r\nof Sir Thomas' particular acquaintances, and is as follows:\r\n\r\n\"DEAR KNIGHT,\r\n\r\n\"I desire you would give my humble service to all our friends, which I\r\nspeak of to you (out of method) in the very beginning of my epistle,\r\nlest the present disorders, by which this seat of gallantry and pleasure\r\nis torn to pieces, should make me forget it. You keep so good company,\r\nthat you know Bath is stocked with such as come hither to be relieved\r\nfrom luxuriant health, or imaginary sickness, and consequently is always\r\nas well stowed with gallants as invalids, who live together in a very\r\ngood understanding. But the season is so early, that our fine company is\r\nnot yet arrived: and the warm Bath, which in heathen times was dedicated\r\nto Venus, is now used only by such as really want it for health's sake.\r\nThere are however a good many strangers, among whom are two ambitious\r\nladies, who being both in the autumn of their life, take the opportunity\r\nof placing themselves at the head of such as we are, before the Chloes,\r\nClarissas, and Pastorellas come down. One of these two is excessively\r\nin pain, that the ugly being called Time will make wrinkles in spite of\r\nthe lead forehead-cloth; and therefore hides, with the gaiety of her\r\nair, the volubility of her tongue, and quickness of her motion, the\r\ninjuries which it has done her. The other lady is but two years behind\r\nher in life, and dreads as much being laid aside as the former, and\r\nconsequently has taken the necessary precautions to prevent her reign\r\nover us. But she is very discreet, and wonderfully turned for ambition,\r\nbeing never apparently transported either with affection or malice.\r\nThus, while Florimel is talking in public, and spreading her graces in\r\nassemblies, to gain a popular dominion over our diversions, Prudentia\r\nvisits very cunningly all the lame, the splenetic, and the\r\nsuperannuated, who have their distinct classes of followers and friends.\r\nAmong these, she has found that some body has sent down printed\r\ncertificates of Florimel's age, which she has read and distributed to\r\nthis unjoyful set of people, who are always enemies to those in\r\npossession of the good opinion of the company. This unprovoked injury\r\ndone by Prudentia, was the first occasion of our fatal divisions here,\r\nand a declaration of war between these rivals. Florimel has abundance of\r\nwit, which she has lavished in decrying Prudentia, and giving defiance\r\nto her little arts. For an instance of her superior power, she bespoke\r\nthe play of 'Alexander the Great,'[210] to be acted by the company of\r\nstrollers, and desired us all to be there on Thursday last. When she\r\nspoke to me to come, 'As you are,' said she, 'a lover, you will not fail\r\nthe death of Alexander: the passion of love is wonderfully hit--Statira!\r\nOh that happy woman--to have a conqueror at her feet--but you will be\r\nsure to be there.' I, and several others, resolved to be of her party.\r\nBut see the irresistible strength of that unsuspected creature, a silent\r\nwoman. Prudentia had counterplotted us, and had bespoke on the same\r\nevening the puppet-show of 'The Creation of the World.'[211] She had\r\nengaged everybody to be there, and, to turn our leader into ridicule,\r\nhad secretly let them know, that the puppet Eve was made the most like\r\nFlorimel that ever was seen. On Thursday morning the puppet-drummer,\r\nAdam and Eve, and several others who lived before the Flood, passed\r\nthrough the streets on horseback, to invite us all to the pastime, and\r\nthe representation of such things as we all knew to be true; and Mr.\r\nMayor was so wise as to prefer these innocent people the puppets, who,\r\nhe said, were to represent Christians, before the wicked players, who\r\nwere to show Alexander, a heathen philosopher. To be short, this\r\nPrudentia had so laid it, that at ten of the clock footmen were sent to\r\ntake places at the puppet-show, and all we of Florimel's party were to\r\nbe out of fashion, or desert her. We chose the latter. All the world\r\ncrowded to Prudentia's house, because it was given out, nobody could get\r\nin. When we came to Noah's flood in the show, Punch and his wife were\r\nintroduced dancing in the Ark. An honest plain friend of Florimel's, but\r\na critic withal, rose up in the midst of the representation, and made\r\nmany very good exceptions to the drama itself, and told us, that it was\r\nagainst all morality, as well as rules of the stage, that Punch should\r\nbe in jest in the Deluge, or indeed that he should appear at all. This\r\nwas certainly a just remark, and I thought to second him; but he was\r\nhissed by Prudentia's party; upon which, really, Sir Thomas, we who were\r\nhis friends, hissed him too. Old Mrs. Petulant desired both her\r\ndaughters to mind the moral; then whispered Mrs. Mayoress, 'This is very\r\nproper for young people to see.' Punch at the end of the play made Madam\r\nPrudentia a compliment, and was very civil to the whole company, making\r\nbows till his buttons touched the ground. All was carried triumphantly\r\nagainst our party. In the meantime Florimel went to the tragedy, dressed\r\nas fine as hands could make her, in hopes to see Prudentia pine away\r\nwith envy. Instead of that, she sat a full hour alone, and at last was\r\nentertained with this whole relation from Statira, who wiped her eyes\r\nwith her tragical-cut handkerchief, and lamented the ignorance of the\r\nquality. Florimel was stung with this affront, and the next day bespoke\r\nthe puppet-show. Prudentia, insolent with power, bespoke 'Alexander.'\r\nThe whole company came then to 'Alexander.' Madam Petulant desired her\r\ndaughters to mind the moral, and believe no man's fair words; 'For\r\nyou'll see, children,' said she, 'these soldiers are never to be\r\ndepended upon; they are sometimes here, sometimes there--don't you see,\r\ndaughter Betty, Colonel Clod, our next neighbour in the country, pulls\r\noff his hat to you? Courtesy, good child, his estate is just by us.'\r\nFlorimel was now mortified down to Prudentia's humour; and Prudentia\r\nexalted into hers. This was observed: Florimel invites us to the play a\r\nsecond time, Prudentia to the show. See the uncertainty of human\r\naffairs! The beaux, the wits, the gamesters, the prues,[212] the\r\ncoquettes, the valetudinarians, and gallants, all now wait upon\r\nFlorimel. Such is the state of things at this present date; and if there\r\nhappens any new commotions, you shall have immediate advice from,\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\r\n\r\n\"Your affectionate Friend\r\n\r\n\"and Servant.\r\n\r\n\"Bath, _May 11_, 1709.\"\r\n\r\n#\"_To Castabella._#\r\n\r\n\"MADAM,\r\n\r\nI have the honour of a letter from a friend of yours, relating to an\r\nincivility done to you at the opera, by one of your own sex; but I, who\r\nwas an eye-witness of the accident, can testify to you, that though she\r\npressed before you, she lost her ends in that design; for she was taken\r\nnotice of for no other reason, but her endeavours to hide a finer woman\r\nthan herself. But indeed, I dare not go farther in this matter, than\r\njust this bare mention; for though it was taking your place of right,\r\nrather than place of precedence, yet it is so tender a point, and on\r\nwhich the very life of female ambition depends, that it is of the last\r\nconsequence to meddle in it: all my hopes are from your beautiful sex;\r\nand those bright eyes, which are the bane of others, are my only\r\nsunshine.

Soon after, these Ministers visited the duke, and made him\r\ncompliments in the name of the States-General; after which they entered\r\ninto a conference with him on the present posture of affairs, and gave\r\nhis grace assurances of the firm adherence of the States to the\r\nalliance: at the same time acquainting him, that all overtures of peace\r\nwere rejected, till they had an opportunity of acting in concert with\r\ntheir allies on that subject. After this interview, the Pensionary and\r\nthe President returned to the assembly of the States. Monsieur Torcy has\r\nhad a conference at the Pensioner's house with his Grace the Duke of\r\nMarlborough, Prince Eugene, and his Excellency the Lord Townshend. The\r\nresult of what was debated at that time is kept secret; but there\r\nappears an air of satisfaction and good understanding between these\r\nMinisters. We are apt also to give ourselves very hopeful prospects from\r\nMonsieur Torcy's being employed in this negotiation, who has been always\r\nremarkable for a particular way of thinking, in his sense of the\r\ngreatness of France; which he has always said, was to be promoted rather\r\nby the arts of peace, than those of war. His delivering himself freely\r\non this subject, has formerly appeared an unsuccessful way to power in\r\nthat Court; but in its present circumstances, those maxims are better\r\nreceived; and it is thought a certain argument of the sincerity of the\r\nFrench king's intentions, that this Minister is at present made use of.\r\nThe marquis is to return to Paris within few days, who has sent a\r\ncourier thither to give notice of the reasons of his return, that the\r\nCourt may be the sooner able to despatch commissions for a formal\r\ntreaty.\r\n\r\nThe expectations of peace are increased by advices from Paris of the\r\n17th instant, which say, the Dauphin hath altered his resolution of\r\ncommanding in Flanders the ensuing campaign.

[STEELE.\r\n\r\nFrom _Tuesday, May 17_, to _Thursday, May 19_, 1709.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nWill's Coffee-house, May 18.\r\n\r\nThe discourse has happened to turn this evening upon the true nature of\r\npanegyric, the perfection of which was asserted to consist in a certain\r\nartful way of conveying the applause in an indirect manner. There was a\r\ngentleman gave us several instances of it: among others, he quoted, from\r\nSir Francis Bacon, in his \"Advancement of Learning,\" a very great\r\ncompliment made to Tiberius, as follows: In a full debate upon public\r\naffairs in the Senate, one of the assembly rose up, and with a very\r\ngrave air said, he thought it for the honour and dignity of the\r\ncommonwealth, that Tiberius should be declared a god, and have divine\r\nworship paid him. The Emperor was surprised at the proposal, and\r\ndemanded of him to declare whether he had made any application to\r\nincline him to that overture? The senator answered, with a bold and\r\nhaughty tone, \"Sir, in matters that concern the commonwealth, I will be\r\ngoverned by no man.\"[213] Another gentleman mentioned something of the\r\nsame kind spoken by the late Duke of B----m,[214] to the late Earl of\r\nO----y:[215] \"My lord,\" says the duke, after his libertine way, \"you\r\nwill certainly be damned.\" \"How, my lord!\" says the earl with some\r\nwarmth. \"Nay,\" said the duke, \"there's no help for it, for it is\r\npositively said, 'Cursed is he of whom all men speak well.'\"[216] This\r\nis taking a man by surprise, and being welcome when you have so\r\nsurprised him. The person flattered receives you into his closet at\r\nonce; and the sudden change in his heart, from the expectation of an\r\nill-wisher, to find you his friend, makes you in his full favour in a\r\nmoment. The spirits that were raised so suddenly against you, are as\r\nsuddenly for you. There was another instance given of this kind at the\r\ntable: a gentleman who had a very great favour done him, and an\r\nemployment bestowed upon him, without so much as being known to his\r\nbenefactor, waited upon the great man who was so generous, and was\r\nbeginning to say, he was infinitely obliged. \"Not at all,\" says the\r\npatron, turning from him to another, \"had I known a more deserving man\r\nin England, he should not have had it.\"\r\n\r\nWe should certainly have had more examples, had not a gentleman\r\nproduced a book which he thought an instance of this kind: it was a\r\npamphlet, called, \"The Naked Truth.\"[217] The idea any one would have\r\nof that work from the title, was, that there would be much plain\r\ndealing with people in power, and that we should see things in their\r\nproper light, stripped of the ornaments which are usually given to the\r\nactions of the great: but the skill of this author is such, that he\r\nhas, under that rugged appearance, approved himself the finest\r\ngentleman and courtier that ever writ. The language is extremely\r\nsublime, and not at all to be understood by the vulgar: the sentiments\r\nare such as would make no figure in ordinary words; but such is the\r\nart of the expression, and the thoughts are elevated to so high a\r\ndegree, that I question whether the discourse will sell much. There\r\nwas an ill-natured fellow present, who hates all panegyric mortally.\r\n\"P---- take him!\" said he, \"what the devil means his 'Naked Truth,'\r\nin speaking nothing but to the advantage of all whom he mentions?\r\nThis is just such a great action as that of the champion's on a\r\ncoronation day, who challenges all mankind to dispute with him the\r\nright of the sovereign, surrounded with his guards.\" The gentleman\r\nwho produced the treatise, desired him to be cautious, and said, it\r\nwas writ by an excellent soldier, which made the company observe it\r\nmore narrowly: and, as critics are the greatest conjurers at finding\r\nout a known truth, one said, he was sure it was writ by the hand of\r\nhis sword-arm. I could not perceive much wit in that expression: but\r\nit raised a laugh, and I suppose, was meant as a sneer upon valiant men.\r\nThe same man pretended to see in the style, that it was a horse officer;\r\nbut sure that's being too nice: for though you may know officers of the\r\ncavalry by the turn of their feet, I can't imagine how you should\r\ndiscern their hands from those of other men. But it is always thus with\r\npedants, they will ever be carping; if a gentleman or a man of honour\r\nputs pen to paper, I don't doubt, but this author will find this\r\nassertion too true, and that obloquy is not repulsed by the force of\r\narms. I will therefore set this excellent piece in a light too glaring\r\nfor weak eyes, and, in imitation of the critic Longinus, shall, as well\r\nas I can, make my observations in a style like the author's, of whom I\r\ntreat; which perhaps I am as capable of as another, having an unbounded\r\nforce of thinking, as well as a most exquisite address, extensively and\r\nwisely indulged to me by the supreme powers. My author, I will dare to\r\nassert, shows the most universal knowledge of any writer who has\r\nappeared this century. He is a poet, and merchant, which is seen in two\r\nmaster-words, Credit Blossoms. He is a grammarian, and a politician; for\r\nhe says, the uniting the two kingdoms is the emphasis of the security to\r\nthe Protestant Succession. Some would be apt to say he is a conjurer;\r\nfor he has found that a republic is not made up of every body of\r\nanimals, but is composed of men only, and not of horses. Liberty and\r\nproperty have chosen their retreat within the emulating circle of a\r\nhuman commonwealth. He is a physician; for he says, \"I observe a\r\nconstant equality in its pulse, and a just quickness of its vigorous\r\ncirculation.\" And again: \"I view the strength of our Constitution\r\nplainly appear in the sanguine and ruddy complexion of a well-contented\r\ncity.\" He is a divine; for he says, \"I cannot but bless myself.\" And\r\nindeed, this excellent treatise has had that good effect upon me, who am\r\nfar from being superstitious, that I, also, can't but bless myself.\r\n\r\n\r\nSt. James's Coffee-house, May 18.\r\n\r\nThis day arrived a mail from Lisbon, with letters of the 13th instant,\r\nN.S., containing a particular account of the late action in Portugal. On\r\nthe 7th instant, the army of Portugal, under the command of the Marquis\r\nde Frontera, lay on the side of the Caya, and the army of the Duke of\r\nAnjou, commanded by the Marquis de Bay, on the other. The latter\r\ncommander having an ambition to ravage the country, in a manner in sight\r\nof the Portuguese, made a motion with the whole body of his horse toward\r\nFort St. Christopher, near the town of Badajos. The generals of the\r\nPortuguese, disdaining that such an insult should be offered to their\r\narms, took a resolution to pass the river, and oppose the designs of the\r\nenemy. The Earl of Galway represented to them, that the present posture\r\nof affairs was such on the side of the Allies, that there needed no more\r\nto be done at present in that country, but to carry on a defensive part.\r\nBut his arguments could not avail in the council of war. Upon which, a\r\ngreat detachment of foot, and the whole of the horse of the King of\r\nPortugal's army, passed the river, and with some pieces of cannon did\r\ngood execution on the enemy. Upon observing this, the Marquis de Bay\r\nadvanced with his horse, and attacked the right wing of the Portuguese\r\ncavalry, who faced about, and fled, without standing the first\r\nencounter. But their foot repulsed the same body of horse in three\r\nsuccessive charges, with great order and resolution. While this was\r\ntransacting, the British general commanded the brigade of Pearce to\r\nkeep the enemy in diversion by a new attack. This was so well executed,\r\nthat the Portuguese infantry had time to retire in good order, and\r\nrepass the river. But that brigade, which rescued them, was itself\r\nsurrounded by the enemy, and Major-General Sarkey, Brigadier Pearce,\r\ntogether with both their regiments, and that of the Lord Galway, lately\r\nraised, were taken prisoners.\r\n\r\nDuring the engagement, the Earl of Barrymore having advanced too far to\r\ngive some necessary order, was hemmed in by a squadron of the enemy; but\r\nfound means to gallop up to the brigade of Pearce, with which he remains\r\nalso a prisoner. My Lord Galway had his horse shot under him in this\r\naction; and the Conde de St. Juan, a Portuguese general, was taken\r\nprisoner. The same night the army encamped at Aronches, and on the 9th\r\nmoved to Elvas, where they lay when these despatches came away. Colonel\r\nStanwix's regiment is also taken. The whole of this affair has given the\r\nPortuguese a great idea of the capacity and courage of my Lord Galway,\r\nagainst whose advice they entered upon this unfortunate affair, and by\r\nwhose conduct they were rescued from it. The prodigious constancy and\r\nresolution of that great man is hardly to be paralleled, who, under the\r\noppression of a maimed body, and the reflection of repeated ill fortune,\r\ngoes on with an unspeakable alacrity in the service of the common cause.\r\nHe has already put things in a very good posture after this ill\r\naccident, and made the necessary dispositions for covering the country\r\nfrom any further attempt of the enemy, who lie still in the camp they\r\nwere in before the battle.\r\n\r\nLetters from Brussels, dated the 25th instant, advise, that\r\nnotwithstanding the negotiations of a peace seem so far advanced, that\r\nsome do confidently report the preliminaries of a treaty to be actually\r\nagreed on; yet the Allies hasten their preparations for opening the\r\ncampaign; and the forces of the Empire, the Prussians, the Danes, the\r\nWirtembergers, the Palatines, and Saxon auxiliaries, are in motion\r\ntowards the general rendezvous, they being already arrived in the\r\nneighbourhood of Brussels. These advices add, that the deputies of the\r\nStates of Holland having made a general review of the troops in\r\nFlanders, set out for Antwerp on the 21st instant from that place. On\r\nthe same day the Prince Royal of Prussia came thither _incognito_, with\r\na design to make the ensuing campaign under his Grace the Duke of\r\nMarlborough.\r\n\r\nThis day is published a treatise called, \"The Difference between Scandal\r\nand Admonition.\" By Isaac Bickerstaff, Esq.; and on the 1st of July\r\nnext, you may expect, \"A Prophecy of Things Past; wherein the Art of\r\nFortune-telling is laid open to the meanest capacity.\" And on the Monday\r\nfollowing, \"Choice Sentences for the Company of Masons and Bricklayers,\r\nto be put upon new Houses, with a translation of all the Latin sentences\r\nthat have been built of late years, together with a comment upon stone\r\nwalls,\" by the same hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 213: See Tacitus, \"Annals,\" i. 8.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 214: George Villiers, Duke of Buckingham.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 215: Roger Boyle, Earl of Orrery.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 216: Luke vi. 26.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 217: Like Nichols, I have not been able to see a copy of this\r\npamphlet, or the defence of it, mentioned in No. 21; but a letter from\r\nPeter Wentworth to Lord Raby, dated 20 May, 1709, throws some light on\r\nthe matter: \"Dear Brother, ... Brigadeer Crowder of late has made some\r\ntalk in the Coffee Houses upon a peice he has lately been pleased to\r\nprint, he did me the favour to show it me some time agoe in manuscript,\r\nand I complymented him with desiring a coppy of it, that I might have\r\nthe pleasure of reading it more than once, and that I might communicate\r\nthe like sattisfaction to you by sending it to Berlin. He told me it had\r\nthe approbation of very ingenious men and good scholars, and his very\r\ngood friends who had persuaded him to print it, and then you, as he\r\nalways esteem'd to be such, shou'd be sure to have one. The day before\r\nyesterday he perform'd his promise but desir'd I wou'd not tell you\r\ndirectly who was the author, but recommend it to you with his most\r\nhumble service, as from a friend of his. Yesterday came out this\r\n_Tatler_, and tho' I reckon myself a little base after all the fine\r\ncomplyments he made me upon my great judgment, I can't forbear sending\r\nit you as a fine peice of rallery upon his elaborate work, which I can\r\nassure you he has not been a little proud of. I han't seen him since to\r\nknow if this _Tatler_ has given him any mortification. I know before he\r\nwas prepar'd for the censorious, for he said lett people say what they\r\nwou'd, he was sure the intention was good, and his meaning for the\r\nservice of the public. I am sorry he has printed, for he's very civill\r\nto me, and always profess a great respect for you, and I wou'd have none\r\nthat does so exposed\" (\"Wentworth Papers,\" pp. 86-7). See No. 46. A\r\nwriter in \"Notes and Queries\" (7 S. iii. 526), in reply to a question of\r\nmine, stated that there is a copy of \"Naked Truth,\" 4to, 1709, in the\r\nBamburgh Castle Library. The pamphlet is anonymous, but is ascribed in\r\nthe catalogue to Colonel Crowder. In May 1710, Thomas Crowther was made\r\na Major-General (Pointer's \"Chron. History,\" ii. 679).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 18. [STEELE AND ADDISON.[218]\r\n\r\nFrom _Thursday, May 19_, to _Saturday, May 21_, 1709.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom my own Apartment, May 20.\r\n\r\nIt is observed too often, that men of wit do so much employ their\r\nthoughts upon fine speculations, that things useful to mankind are\r\nwholly neglected; and they are busy in making emendations upon some\r\nenclitics in a Greek author, while obvious things, that every man may\r\nhave use for, are wholly overlooked. It would be a happy thing, if such\r\nas have real capacities for public service, were employed in works of\r\ngeneral use; but because a thing is everybody's business, it is nobody's\r\nbusiness: this is for want of public spirit. As for my part, who am only\r\na student, and a man of no great interest, I can only remark things, and\r\nrecommend the correction of them to higher powers. There is an offence I\r\nhave a thousand times lamented, but fear I shall never see remedied;\r\nwhich is, that in a nation where learning is so frequent as in Great\r\nBritain, there should be so many gross errors as there are in the very\r\ndirections of things, wherein accuracy is necessary for the conduct of\r\nlife. This is notoriously observed by all men of letters when they first\r\ncome to town (at which time they are usually curious that way) in the\r\ninscriptions on sign-posts. I have cause to know this matter as well as\r\nanybody; for I have (when I went to Merchant Taylors' School) suffered\r\nstripes for spelling after the signs I observed in my way; though at the\r\nsame time, I must confess, staring at those inscriptions first gave me\r\nan idea and curiosity for medals; in which I have since arrived at some\r\nknowledge.[219] Many a man has lost his way and his dinner by this\r\ngeneral want of skill in orthography: for, considering that the painters\r\nare usually so very bad, that you cannot know the animal under whose\r\nsign you are to live that day, how must the stranger be misled, if it be\r\nwrong spelled, as well as ill painted? I have a cousin now in town, who\r\nhas answered under Bachelor at Queen's College, whose name is Humphrey\r\nMopstaff (he is akin to us by his mother). This young man going to see a\r\nrelation in Barbican, wandered a whole day by the mistake of one letter;\r\nfor it was written, \"This is the BEER,\" instead of \"This is the BEAR.\"\r\nHe was set right at last, by inquiring for the house, of a fellow who\r\ncould not read, and knew the place mechanically, only by having been\r\noften drunk there. But, in the name of goodness, let us make our\r\nlearning of use to us, or not. Was not this a shame, that a philosopher\r\nshould be thus directed by a cobbler? I'll be sworn, if it were known\r\nhow many have suffered in this kind by false spelling since the union,\r\nthis matter would not long lie thus. What makes these evils the more\r\ninsupportable, is, that they are so easily amended, and nothing done in\r\nit. But it is so far from that, that the evil goes on in other arts as\r\nwell as orthography. Places are confounded, as well for want of proper\r\ndistinctions, as things for want of true characters. Had I not come by\r\nthe other day very early in the morning, there might have been mischief\r\ndone; for a worthy North Briton was swearing at Stocks Market,[220] that\r\nthey would not let him in at his lodgings; but I knowing the gentleman,\r\nand observing him look often at the King on horseback, and then double\r\nhis oaths, that he was sure he was right, found he mistook that for\r\nCharing Cross, by the erection of the like statue in each place. I\r\ngrant, private men may distinguish their abodes as they please; as one\r\nof my acquaintance who lives at Marylebone, has put a good sentence of\r\nhis own invention upon his dwelling-place, to find out where he lives:\r\nhe is so near London, that his conceit is this, \"The country in town;\r\nor, the town in the country\"; for you know, if they are both in one,\r\nthey are all one. Besides that, the ambiguity is not of great\r\nconsequence; if you are safe at the place, it is no matter if you do not\r\ndistinctly know where to say the place is. But to return to the\r\northography of public places: I propose that every tradesman in the\r\ncities of London and Westminster shall give me sixpence a quarter for\r\nkeeping their signs in repair, as to the grammatical part; and I will\r\ntake into my house a Swiss Count[221] of my acquaintance, who can\r\nremember all their names without book, for despatch sake, setting up the\r\nhead of the said foreigner for my sign; the features being strong, and\r\nfit for hanging high.\r\n\r\n\r\nSt. James's Coffee-house, May 20.\r\n\r\nThis day a mail arrived from Holland, by which there are advices from\r\nParis, that the kingdom of France is in the utmost misery and\r\ndistraction. The merchants of Lyons have been at Court, to remonstrate\r\ntheir great sufferings by the failure of their public credit; but have\r\nreceived no other satisfaction, than promises of a sudden peace; and\r\nthat their debts will be made good by funds out of the revenue, which\r\nwill not answer, but in case of the peace which is promised. In the\r\nmeantime, the cries of the common people are loud for want of bread, the\r\ngentry have lost all spirit and zeal for their country, and the king\r\nhimself seems to languish under the anxiety of the pressing calamities\r\nof the nation, and retires from hearing those grievances which he hath\r\nnot power to redress. Instead of preparations for war, and the defence\r\nof their country, there is nothing to be seen but evident marks of a\r\ngeneral despair. Processions, fastings, public mournings, and\r\nhumiliations, are become the sole employments of a people, who were\r\nlately the most vain and gay of any in the universe.\r\n\r\nThe Pope has written to the French king on the subject of a peace, and\r\nhis Majesty has answered in the lowliest terms, that he entirely submits\r\nhis affairs to divine providence, and shall soon show the world, that he\r\nprefers the tranquillity of his people to the glory of his arms, and\r\nextent of his conquests.\r\n\r\nLetters from the Hague of the 24th say, that his Excellency the Lord\r\nTownshend delivered his credentials on that day to the States-General,\r\nas plenipotentiary from the Queen of Great Britain; as did also Count\r\nZinzendorf, who bears the same character from the Emperor.\r\n\r\nPrince Eugene intended to set out the next day for Brussels, and his\r\nGrace the Duke of Marlborough on the Tuesday following. The Marquis de\r\nTorcy talks daily of going, but still continues here. The army of the\r\nAllies is to assemble on the 7th of the next month at Helchin; though it\r\nis generally believed, that the preliminaries to a treaty are fully\r\nadjusted.\r\n\r\nThe approach of a peace[222] strikes a panic through our armies, though\r\nthat of a battle could never do it, and they almost repent of their\r\nbravery, that made such haste to humble themselves and the French king.\r\nThe Duke of Marlborough, though otherwise the greatest general of the\r\nage, has plainly shown himself unacquainted with the arts of husbanding\r\na war. He might have grown as old as the Duke of Alva, or Prince\r\nWaldeck, in the Low Countries, and yet have got reputation enough every\r\nyear for any reasonable man: for the command of general in Flanders hath\r\nbeen ever looked upon as a provision for life. For my part, I can't see\r\nhow his grace can answer it to the world, for the great eagerness he\r\nhath shown to send a hundred thousand of the bravest fellows in Europe a\r\nbegging. But the private gentlemen of the infantry will be able to shift\r\nfor themselves; a brave man can never starve in a country stocked with\r\nhen-roosts. \"There is not a yard of linen,\" says my honoured progenitor,\r\nSir John Falstaff, \"in my whole company; but as for that,\" says this\r\nworthy knight, \"I am in no great pain, we shall find shirts on every\r\nhedge.\"[223] There is another sort of gentlemen whom I am much more\r\nconcerned for, and that is, the ingenious fraternity of which I have the\r\nhonour to be an unworthy member; I mean the news-writers of Great\r\nBritain, whether Postmen or Postboys,[224] or by what other name or\r\ntitle soever dignified or distinguished. The case of these gentlemen is,\r\nI think, more hard than that of the soldiers, considering that they\r\nhave taken more towns, and fought more battles. They have been upon\r\nparties and skirmishes, when our armies have lain still; and given the\r\ngeneral assault to many a place, when the besiegers were quiet in their\r\ntrenches. They have made us masters of several strong towns many weeks\r\nbefore our generals could do it; and completed victories, when our\r\ngreatest captains have been glad to come off with a drawn battle. Where\r\nPrince Eugene has slain his thousands, Boyer[225] has slain his ten\r\nthousands. This, gentleman can indeed be never enough commended for his\r\ncourage and intrepidity during this whole war: he has laid about him\r\nwith an inexpressible fury, and like the offended Marius of ancient\r\nRome, made such havoc among his countrymen, as must be the work of two\r\nor three ages to repair. It must be confessed, the redoubted Mr.\r\nBuckley[226] has shed as much blood as the former; but I cannot forbear\r\nsaying (and I hope it will not look like envy) that we regard our\r\nbrother Buckley as a Drawcansir,[227] who spares neither friend nor foe,\r\nbut generally kills as many of his own side as the enemy's. It is\r\nimpossible for this ingenious sort of men to subsist after a peace:\r\nevery one remembers the shifts they were driven to in the reign of King\r\nCharles II., when they could not furnish out a single paper of news,\r\nwithout lighting up a comet in Germany, or a fire in Moscow. There\r\nscarce appeared a letter without a paragraph on an earthquake. Prodigies\r\nwere grown so familiar, that they had lost their name, as a great poet\r\nof that age has it. I remember Mr. Dyer,[228] who is justly looked upon\r\nby all the fox-hunters in the nation as the greatest statesman our\r\ncountry has produced, was particularly famous for dealing in whales;\r\ninsomuch that in five months' time (for I had the curiosity to examine\r\nhis letters on that occasion) he brought three into the mouth of the\r\nriver Thames, besides two porpoises and a sturgeon. The judicious and\r\nwary Mr. I. Dawks[229] hath all along been the rival of this great\r\nwriter, and got himself a reputation from plagues and famines, by which,\r\nin those days, he destroyed as great multitudes as he has lately done by\r\nthe sword. In every dearth of news, Grand Cairo was sure to be\r\nunpeopled.\r\n\r\nIt being therefore visible, that our society will be greater sufferers\r\nby the peace than the soldiery itself; insomuch that the _Daily\r\nCourant_[230] is in danger of being broken, my friend Dyer of being\r\nreformed, and the very best of the whole band of being reduced to\r\nhalf-pay; might I presume to offer anything in the behalf of my\r\ndistressed brethren, I would humbly move, that an appendix of proper\r\napartments furnished with pen, ink, and paper, and other necessaries of\r\nlife should be added to the Hospital of Chelsea,[231] for the relief of\r\nsuch decayed news-writers as have served their country in the wars; and\r\nthat for their exercise, they should compile the annals of their\r\nbrother-veterans, who have been engaged in the same service, and are\r\nstill obliged to do duty after the same manner.\r\n\r\nI cannot be thought to speak this out of an eye to any private interest;\r\nfor, as my chief scenes of action are coffee-houses, play-houses, and my\r\nown apartment, I am in no need of camps, fortifications, and fields of\r\nbattle, to support me; I don't call out for heroes and generals to my\r\nassistance. Though the officers are broken, and the armies disbanded, I\r\nshall still be safe as long as there are men or women, or politicians,\r\nor lovers, or poets, or nymphs, or swains, or cits, or courtiers in\r\nbeing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 218: It is very possible that the first article in this number\r\n(see the allusion to medals) is by Addison, as well as the account of\r\nthe Distress of the News-writers.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 219: There is much about medals in Addison's \"Remarks on\r\nseveral Parts of Italy,\" 1705.

The Turk underneath the horse was\r\nmetamorphosed into Oliver Cromwell; but his turban escaped unnoticed or\r\nunaltered, to testify the truth. The statue in Stocks Market, with the\r\nconduit and all its ornaments, was removed to make way for the Mansion\r\nHouse in 1739.

The appellation of Esquire is the most\r\nnotoriously abused in this kind of any class amongst men, insomuch that\r\nit is become almost the subject of derision: but I will be bold to say,\r\nthis behaviour towards it proceeds from the ignorance of the people in\r\nits true origin. I shall therefore, as briefly as possible, do myself\r\nand all true esquires the justice to look into antiquity upon this\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nIn the first ages of the world, before the invention of jointures and\r\nsettlements, when the noble passion of love had possession of the hearts\r\nof men, and the fair sex were not yet cultivated into the merciful\r\ndisposition which they have showed in latter centuries, it was natural\r\nfor great and heroic spirits to retire to rivulets, woods, and caves, to\r\nlament their destiny, and the cruelty of the fair persons who were deaf\r\nto their lamentations. The hero in this distress was generally in\r\narmour, and in a readiness to fight any man he met with, especially if\r\ndistinguished by any extraordinary qualifications, it being the nature\r\nof heroic love to hate all merit, lest it should come within the\r\nobservation of the cruel one, by whom its own perfections are neglected.\r\nA lover of this kind had always about him a person of a second value,\r\nand subordinate to him, who could hear his afflictions, carry an\r\nenchantment for his wounds, hold his helmet when he was eating (if ever\r\nhe did eat); or in his absence, when he was retired to his apartment in\r\nany king's palace, tell the prince himself, or perhaps his daughter, the\r\nbirth, parentage, and adventures, of his valiant master. This trusty\r\ncompanion was styled his esquire, and was always fit for any offices\r\nabout him; was as gentle and chaste as a gentleman usher, quick and\r\nactive as an equerry, smooth and eloquent as a master of the ceremonies.\r\nA man thus qualified was the first, as the ancients affirm, who was\r\ncalled an esquire; and none without these accomplishments ought to\r\nassume our order: but, to the utter disgrace and confusion of the\r\nheralds, every pretender is admitted into this fraternity, even persons\r\nthe most foreign to this courteous institution. I have taken an\r\ninventory of all within this city, and looked over every letter in the\r\npost-office for my better information. There are of the Middle Temple,\r\nincluding all in the buttery books, and in the lists of the house, 5000.\r\nIn the Inner, 4000. In the King's Bench Walks, the whole buildings are\r\ninhabited by esquires only. The adjacent street of Essex, from Morris'\r\nCoffee-house, and the turning towards the Grecian, you cannot meet one\r\nwho is not an esquire, till you take water. Every house in Norfolk and\r\nArundel Streets is governed also by a squire, or his lady. Soho Square,\r\nBloomsbury Square, and all other places where the floors rise above nine\r\nfeet, are so many universities, where you enter yourselves, and become\r\nof our order. However, if this were the worst of the evil, it were to be\r\nsupported, because they are generally men of some figure and use; though\r\nI know no pretence they have to an honour which had its rise from\r\nchivalry. But if you travel into the counties of Great Britain, we are\r\nstill more imposed upon by innovation. We are indeed derived from the\r\nfield: but shall that give title to all that ride mad after foxes, that\r\nhalloo when they see a hare, or venture their necks full speed after a\r\nhawk, immediately to commence esquires? No, our order is temperate,\r\ncleanly, sober, and chaste; but these rural esquires commit immodesties\r\nupon haycocks, wear shirts half a week, and are drunk twice a day. These\r\nmen are also to the last degree excessive in their food: an esquire of\r\nNorfolk eats two pounds of dumpling every meal, as if obliged to it by\r\nour order: an esquire of Hampshire is as ravenous in devouring hogs'\r\nflesh: one of Essex has as little mercy on calves. But I must take the\r\nliberty to protest against them, and acquaint those persons, that it is\r\nnot the quantity they eat, but the manner of eating, that shows a\r\nsquire. But above all, I am most offended at small quillmen, and\r\ntranscribing clerks, who are all come into our order, for no reason that\r\nI know of, but that they can easily flourish it at the end of their\r\nname. I'll undertake, that if you read the superscriptions to all the\r\noffices in the kingdom, you will not find three letters directed to any\r\nbut esquires. I have myself a couple of clerks, and the rogues make\r\nnothing of leaving messages upon each other's desk: one directs, to\r\n\"Degory Goosequill, Esq.\"; to which the other replies by a note, to\r\n\"Nehemiah Dashwell, Esq.; with respect.\" In a word, it is now, _populus\r\narmigerorum_, a people of esquires. And I don't know, but, by the late\r\nAct of Naturalisation,[232] foreigners will assume that title, as part\r\nof the immunity of being Englishmen. All these improprieties flow from\r\nthe negligence of the Heralds' Office. Those gentlemen in parti-coloured\r\nhabits do not so rightly, as they ought, understand themselves; though\r\nthey are dressed _cap-a-pié_ in hieroglyphics, they are inwardly but\r\nignorant men. I asked an acquaintance of mine, who is a man of wit, but\r\nof no fortune, and is forced to appear as Jack Pudding on the stage to a\r\nmountebank: \"Prithee, Jack, why is your coat of so many colours?\" He\r\nreplied, \"I act a fool, and this spotted dress is to signify, that every\r\nman living has a weak place about him; for I am knight of the shire, and\r\nrepresent you all.\" I wish the heralds would know as well as this man\r\ndoes, in his way, that they are to act for us in the case of our arms\r\nand appellations: we should not then be jumbled together in so\r\npromiscuous and absurd a manner. I design to take this matter into\r\nfurther consideration, and no man shall be received as an esquire, who\r\ncannot bring a certificate, that he has conquered some lady's obdurate\r\nheart; that he can lead up a country dance, or carry a message between\r\nher and her lover, with address, secrecy and diligence. A squire is\r\nproperly born for the service of the sex, and his credentials shall be\r\nsigned by three toasts, and one prude, before his title shall be\r\nreceived in my office.\r\n\r\n\r\nWill's Coffee-house, May 23.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday last was presented, \"The Busy Body,\" a comedy, written (as I\r\nhave heretofore remarked) by a woman.[233] The plot and incidents of the\r\nplay are laid with that subtlety of spirit which is peculiar to females\r\nof wit, and is very seldom well performed by those of the other sex, in\r\nwhom craft in love is an act of invention, and not, as with women, the\r\neffect of nature and instinct.\r\n\r\nTo-morrow will be acted a play, called, \"The Trip to the Jubilee.\"[234]\r\nThis performance is the greatest instance that we can have of the\r\nirresistible force of proper action. The dialogue in itself has\r\nsomething too low to bear a criticism upon it: but Mr. Wilks enters into\r\nthe part with so much skill, that the gallantry, the youth, and gaiety\r\nof a young man of a plentiful fortune, is looked upon with as much\r\nindulgence on the stage, as in real life, without any of those\r\nintermixtures of wit and humour, which usually prepossess us in favour\r\nof such characters in other plays.\r\n\r\n\r\nSt. James's Coffee-house, May 23.\r\n\r\nLetters from the Hague of the 23rd instant, N.S., say, Mr. Walpole[235]\r\n(who is since arrived) was going with all expedition to Great Britain,\r\nwhither they doubted not but he carried with him the preliminaries to a\r\ntreaty of peace. The French Minister, Monsieur Torcy, has been observed\r\nin this whole negotiation to turn his discourse upon the calamities sent\r\ndown by Heaven upon France, and imputed the necessities they were under\r\nto the immediate hand of Providence, in inflicting a general scarcity of\r\nprovision, rather than the superior genius of the generals, or the\r\nbravery of the armies against them. It would be impious not to\r\nacknowledge the indulgence of Heaven to us; but at the same time, as we\r\nare to love our enemies, we are glad to see them mortified enough to mix\r\nChristianity with their politics. An authentic letter from Madame\r\nMaintenon to Monsieur Torcy has been stolen by a person about him, who\r\nhas communicated a copy of it to some of the dependants of a Minister of\r\nthe Allies. That epistle is writ in the most pathetic manner imaginable,\r\nand in a style which shows her genius, that has so long engrossed the\r\nheart of this great monarch.[236]\r\n\r\n\"SIR,\r\n\r\n\"I received yours, and am sensible of the address and capacity with\r\nwhich you have hitherto transacted the great affair under your\r\nmanagement. You well observe, that our wants here are not to be\r\nconcealed; and that it is vanity to use artifices with the knowing men\r\nwith whom you are to deal. Let me beg you therefore, in this\r\nrepresentation of our circumstances, to lay aside art, which ceases to\r\nbe such when it is seen, and make use of all your skill, to gain us what\r\nadvantages you can from the enemy's jealousy of each other's greatness;\r\nwhich is the place where only you have room for any dexterity. If you\r\nhave any passion for your unhappy country, or any affection for your\r\ndistressed master, come home with peace. O Heaven! Do I live to talk of\r\nLewis the Great as the object of pity? The king shows a great uneasiness\r\nto be informed of all that passes; but at the same time, is fearful of\r\nevery one who appears in his presence, lest he should bring an account\r\nof some new calamity. I know not in what terms to represent my thoughts\r\nto you, when I speak of the king, with relation to his bodily health.\r\nFigure to yourself that immortal man, who stood in our public places,\r\nrepresented with trophies, armour, and terrors, on his pedestal:\r\nconsider, the Invincible, the Great, the Good, the Pious, the Mighty,\r\nwhich were the usual epithets we gave him, both in our language and\r\nthoughts. I say, consider him whom you knew the most glorious and great\r\nof monarchs; and now think you see the same man an unhappy Lazar, in the\r\nlowest circumstances of human nature itself, without regard to the state\r\nfrom whence he is fallen. I write from his bedside: he is at present in\r\na slumber. I have many, many things to add; but my tears flow too fast,\r\nand my sorrow is too big for utterance.\r\n\r\n\"I am, etc.\"\r\n\r\nThere is such a veneration due from all men to the persons of princes,\r\nthat it were a sort of dishonesty to represent further the condition\r\nwhich the king is in; but it is certain, that soon after the receipt of\r\nthese advices, Monsieur Torcy waited upon his Grace the Duke of\r\nMarlborough and the Lord Townshend, and in that conference gave up many\r\npoints, which he had before said were such, as he must return to France\r\nbefore he could answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 232: See No. 13.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 233: Mrs. Centlivre.

[STEELE.\r\n\r\nFrom _Tuesday, May 24_, to _Thursday, May 26_, 1709.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nWhite's Chocolate-house, May 24.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be imagined how far prepossession will run away with\r\npeople's understandings, in cases wherein they are under present\r\nuneasiness. The following narration is a sufficient testimony of the\r\ntruth of this observation.\r\n\r\nI had the honour the other day of a visit from a gentlewoman (a stranger\r\nto me) who seemed to be about thirty. Her complexion is brown; but the\r\nair of her face has an agreeableness, which surpasses the beauties of\r\nthe fairest women. There appeared in her look and mien a sprightly\r\nhealth; and her eyes had too much vivacity to become the language of\r\ncomplaint, which she began to enter into. She seemed sensible of it; and\r\ntherefore, with downcast looks, said she, \"Mr. Bickerstaff, you see\r\nbefore you the unhappiest of women; and therefore, as you are esteemed\r\nby all the world both a great civilian, as well as an astrologer, I must\r\ndesire your advice and assistance, in putting me in a method of\r\nobtaining a divorce from a marriage, which I know the law will pronounce\r\nvoid.\" \"Madam,\" said I, \"your grievance is of such a nature, that you\r\nmust be very ingenuous in representing the causes of your complaint, or\r\nI cannot give you the satisfaction you desire.\" \"Sir,\" she answers, \"I\r\nbelieved there would be no need of half your skill in the art of\r\ndivination, to guess why a woman would part from her husband.\" \"It is\r\ntrue,\" said I; \"but suspicions, or guesses at what you mean, nay\r\ncertainty of it, except you plainly speak it, are no foundation for a\r\nformal suit.\" She clapped her fan before her face; \"My husband,\" said\r\nshe, \"is no more a husband\" (here she burst into tears) \"than one of the\r\nItalian singers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Madam,\" said I, \"the affliction you complain of, is to be redressed by\r\nlaw; but at the same time, consider what mortifications you are to go\r\nthrough in bringing it into open court; how you will be able to bear the\r\nimpertinent whispers of the people present at the trial, the licentious\r\nreflections of the pleaders, and the interpretations that will in\r\ngeneral be put upon your conduct by all the world: 'How little,' will\r\nthey say, 'could that lady command her passions.' Besides, consider,\r\nthat curbing our desires is the greatest glory we can arrive at in this\r\nworld, and will be most rewarded in the next.\" She answered, like a\r\nprudent matron, \"Sir, if you please to remember the office of matrimony,\r\nthe first cause of its institution is that of having posterity:\r\ntherefore, as to the curbing desires, I am willing to undergo any\r\nabstinence from food as you please to enjoin me; but I cannot, with any\r\nquiet of mind, live in the neglect of a necessary duty, and an express\r\ncommandment, Increase and multiply.\" Observing she was learned, and\r\nknew so well the duties of life, I turned my arguments rather to dehort\r\nher from this public procedure by examples, than precepts. \"Do but\r\nconsider, madam, what crowds of beauteous women live in nunneries,\r\nsecluded for ever from the sight and conversation of men, with all the\r\nalacrity of spirit imaginable; they spend their time in heavenly\r\nraptures, in constant and frequent devotions, and at proper hours in\r\nagreeable conversations.\" \"Sir,\" said she hastily, \"tell not me of\r\nPapists, or any of their idolatries.\" \"Well then, madam, consider how\r\nmany fine ladies live innocently in the eye of the world, and this gay\r\ntown, in the midst of temptation: there's the witty Mrs. W---- is a\r\nvirgin of 44, Mrs. T----s is 39, Mrs. L----ce, 33; yet you see, they\r\nlaugh and are gay, at the park, at the playhouse, at balls, and at\r\nvisits; and so much at ease, that all this seems hardly a self-denial.\"\r\n\"Mr. Bickerstaff,\" said she, with some emotion, \"you are an excellent\r\ncasuist; but the last word destroyed your whole argument; if it is not\r\nself-denial, it is no virtue. I presented you with a half-guinea, in\r\nhopes not only to have my conscience eased, but my fortune told. Yet--\"\r\n\"Well, madam,\" said I, \"pray of what age is your husband?\" \"He is,\"\r\nreplied my injured client, \"fifty, and I have been his wife fifteen\r\nyears.\" \"How happened it, you never communicated your distress in all\r\nthis time to your friends and relations?\" She answered, \"He has been\r\nthus but a fortnight.\" I am the most serious man in the world to look\r\nat, and yet could not forbear laughing out. \"Why, madam, in case of\r\ninfirmity, which proceeds only from age, the law gives no remedy.\"\r\n\"Sir,\" said she, \"I find you have no more learning than Dr. Case;[237]\r\nand I am told of a young man, not five and twenty, just come from\r\nOxford, to whom I will communicate this whole matter, and doubt not but\r\nhe will appear to have seven times more useful and satisfactory\r\nknowledge than you and all your boasted family.\" Thus I have entirely\r\nlost my client: but if this tedious narrative preserves Pastorella from\r\nthe intended marriage with one twenty years her senior--To save a fine\r\nlady, I am contented to have my learning decried, and my predictions\r\nbound up with Poor Robin's Almanacks.\r\n\r\n\r\nWill's Coffee-house, May 25.\r\n\r\nThis evening was acted, \"The Recruiting Officer,\"[238] in which Mr.\r\nEstcourt's[239] proper sense and observation is what supports the play.\r\nThere is not, in my humble opinion, the humour hit in Sergeant Kite; but\r\nit is admirably supplied by his action. If I have skill to judge, that\r\nman is an excellent actor; but the crowd of the audience are fitter for\r\nrepresentations at Mayfair, than a theatre royal. Yet that fair is now\r\nbroke,[240] as well as the theatre is breaking: but it is allowed still\r\nto sell animals there. Therefore, if any lady or gentleman have occasion\r\nfor a tame elephant, let them inquire of Mr. Pinkethman, who has one to\r\ndispose of at a reasonable rate.[241] The downfall of Mayfair has quite\r\nsunk the price of this noble creature, as well as of many other\r\ncuriosities of nature. A tiger will sell almost as cheap as an ox; and I\r\nam credibly informed, a man may purchase a cat with three legs, for very\r\nnear the value of one with four. I hear likewise, that there is a great\r\ndesolation among the gentlemen and ladies who were the ornaments of the\r\ntown, and used to shine in plumes and diadems; the heroes being most of\r\nthem pressed, and the queens beating hemp. Mrs. Sarabrand, so famous for\r\nher ingenious puppet-show, has set up a shop in the Exchange,[242] where\r\nshe sells her little troop under the term of jointed babies.[243] I\r\ncould not but be solicitous to know of her, how she had disposed of that\r\nrake-hell Punch, whose lewd life and conversation had given so much\r\nscandal, and did not a little contribute to the ruin of the fair. She\r\ntold me, with a sigh, that despairing of ever reclaiming him, she would\r\nnot offer to place him in a civil family, but got him in a post upon a\r\nstall in Wapping, where he may be seen from sun-rising to sun-setting,\r\nwith a glass in one hand, and a pipe in the other, as sentry to a\r\nbrandy-shop. The great revolutions of this nature bring to my mind the\r\ndistresses of the unfortunate Camilla[244], who has had the ill-luck to\r\nbreak before her voice, and to disappear at a time when her beauty was\r\nin the height of its bloom. This lady entered so thoroughly into the\r\ngreat characters she acted, that when she had finished her part, she\r\ncould not think of retrenching her equipage, but would appear in her own\r\nlodgings with the same magnificence that she did upon the stage. This\r\ngreatness of soul has reduced that unhappy princess to an involuntary\r\nretirement, where she now passes her time among the woods and forests,\r\nthinking on the crowns and sceptres she has lost, and often humming over\r\nin her solitude,\r\n\r\n    _\"I was born of royal race,\r\n    Yet must wander in disgrace,\" &c._\r\n\r\nBut for fear of being overheard, and her quality known, she usually\r\nsings it in Italian:\r\n\r\n    _\"Naqui al regno, naqui al trono\r\n    E pur sono\r\n    Inventurata Pastorella--\"_\r\n\r\nSince I have touched upon this subject, I shall communicate to my reader\r\npart of a letter I have received from an ingenious friend at Amsterdam,\r\nwhere there is a very noble theatre; though the manner of furnishing it\r\nwith actors is something peculiar to that place, and gives us occasion\r\nto admire both the politeness and frugality of the people.\r\n\r\nMy friends have kept me here a week longer than ordinary to see one of\r\ntheir plays, which was performed last night with great applause. The\r\nactors are all of them tradesmen, who, after their day's work is over,\r\nearn about a guilder a night by personating kings and generals. The hero\r\nof the tragedy I saw, was a journeyman tailor, and his first minister of\r\nstate a coffee-man. The empress made me think of Parthenope[245] in \"The\r\nRehearsal\"; for her mother keeps an ale-house in the suburbs of\r\nAmsterdam. When the tragedy was over, they entertained us with a short\r\nfarce, in which the cobbler did his part to a miracle; but upon inquiry,\r\nI found he had really been working at his own trade, and representing on\r\nthe stage what he acted every day in his shop. The profits of the\r\ntheatre maintain a hospital: for as here they do not think the\r\nprofession of an actor the only trade that a man ought to exercise, so\r\nthey will not allow anybody to grow rich on a profession that in their\r\nopinion so little conduces to the good of the commonwealth. If I am not\r\nmistaken, your playhouses in England have done the same thing; for,\r\nunless I am misinformed, the hospital at Dulwich was erected and endowed\r\nby Mr. Alleyn,[246] a player: and it is also said, a famous\r\nshe-tragedian[247] has settled her estate, after her death, for the\r\nmaintenance of decayed wits, who are to be taken in as soon as they grow\r\ndull, at whatever time of their life that shall happen.\r\n\r\n\r\nSt. James's Coffee-house, May 25.\r\n\r\nLetters from the Hague of the 31st instant, N.S., say, that the articles\r\npreliminary to a general peace were settled, communicated to the\r\nStates-General and all the foreign Ministers residing there, and\r\ntransmitted to their respective masters on the 28th. Monsieur Torcy\r\nimmediately returned to the Court of France, from whence he is expected\r\nagain on the 4th of the next month, with those articles ratified by that\r\nCourt. The Hague is agreed upon for the place of treaty, and the 15th of\r\nthe next month the day on which it is to commence. The terms on which\r\nthis negotiation is founded, are not yet declared by public authority;\r\nbut what is most generally received, is as follows:\r\n\r\nHer Majesty's right and title, and the Protestant succession to those\r\ndominions, is forthwith to be acknowledged. King Charles is also to be\r\nowned the lawful sovereign of Spain; and the French king shall not only\r\nrecall his troops out of that kingdom, and deliver up to the Allies the\r\ntowns of Roses, Fontarabia, and Pampeluna; but in case the Duke of Anjou\r\nshall not retire out of the Spanish dominions, he shall be obliged to\r\nassist the Allies to force him from thence. A cessation of arms is\r\nagreed upon for two months from the first day of the treaty. The port\r\nand fortifications of Dunkirk are to be demolished within four months;\r\nbut the town itself left in the hands of the French. The Pretender is to\r\nbe obliged to leave France. All Newfoundland is to be restored to the\r\nEnglish. As to the other parts of America, the French are to restore\r\nwhatever they may have taken from the English, as the English in like\r\nmanner to give up what they may have taken from the French before the\r\ncommencement of the treaty. The trade between Great Britain and France\r\nshall be settled upon the same foundation as in the reign of King\r\nCharles II.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch are to have for their barriers, Nieuport, Berg, St. Vinox,\r\nFurnes, Ipres, Lille, Tournay, Douay, Valenciennes, Condé, Maubeuge,\r\nMons, Charleroy, Namur, and Luxemburg; all which places shall be\r\ndelivered up to the Allies before the end of June. The trade between\r\nHolland and France shall be on the same foot as in 1664. The cities of\r\nStrasburg, Brisac, and Alsatia, shall be restored to the Emperor and\r\nEmpire; and the King of France, pursuant to the Treaty of Westphalia in\r\n1648, shall only retain the protection of ten imperial cities, viz.,\r\nColmar, Schlestat, Haguenau, Munster, Turkeim, Keisemberg, Obrenheim,\r\nRosheim, Weisemburg, and Landau. Huninguen, Fort Louis, Fort Kiel, and\r\nNew Brisac shall be demolished, and all the fortifications from Basle to\r\nPhilipsburg. The King of Prussia shall remain in the peaceable\r\npossession of Neufchatel. The affair of Orange, as also the pretensions\r\nof his Prussian Majesty in the French Comté, shall be determined at this\r\ngeneral negotiation of peace. The Duke of Savoy shall have a restitution\r\nmade of all that has been taken from him by the French, and remain\r\nmaster of Exilles, Chamont, Fenestrelles, and the Valley of\r\nPragelas.[248]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 237: John Case, astrologer and friend of John Partridge,\r\nsucceeded to Saffold's habitation in Blackfriars gateway, opposite to\r\nLudgate Church, whence he issued many advertisements. \"Their old\r\nphysician begged they would not forget him--he gives his advice for\r\nnothing--his cures are private.

[STEELE.\r\n\r\nFrom _Thursday, May 26_, to _Saturday, May 28_, 1709.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nWhite's Chocolate-house, May 26.\r\n\r\nA gentleman has writ to me out of the country a very civil letter, and\r\nsaid things which I suppress with great violence to my vanity. There are\r\nmany terms in my narratives which he complains want explaining, and has\r\ntherefore desired, that, for the benefit of my country readers, I would\r\nlet him know what I mean by a Gentleman, a Pretty Fellow, a Toast, a\r\nCoquette, a Critic, a Wit, and all other appellations in the gayer\r\nworld, who are in present possession of these several characters;\r\ntogether with an account of those who unfortunately pretend to them. I\r\nshall begin with him we usually call a Gentleman, or man of\r\nconversation. It is generally thought, that warmth of imagination, quick\r\nrelish of pleasure, and a manner of becoming it, are the most essential\r\nqualities for forming this sort of man. But any one that is much in\r\ncompany will observe, that the height of good breeding is shown rather\r\nin never giving offence, than in doing obliging things. Thus, he that\r\nnever shocks you, though he is seldom entertaining, is more likely to\r\nkeep your favour, than he who often entertains, and sometimes displeases\r\nyou. The most necessary talent therefore in a man of conversation, which\r\nis what we ordinarily intend by a fine gentleman, is a good judgment. He\r\nthat has this in perfection, is master of his companion, without letting\r\nhim see it; and has the same advantage over men of any other\r\nqualifications whatsoever, as one that can see would have over a blind\r\nman of ten times his strength. This is what makes Sophronius the\r\ndarling of all who converse with him, and the most powerful with his\r\nacquaintance of any man in town. By the light of this faculty, he acts\r\nwith great ease and freedom among the men of pleasure, and acquits\r\nhimself with skill and despatch among the men of business. This he\r\nperforms with so much success, that, with as much discretion in life as\r\nany man ever had, he neither is, nor appears, cunning. But as he does a\r\ngood office, if he ever does it, with readiness and alacrity; so he\r\ndenies what he does not care to engage in, in a manner that convinces\r\nyou, that you ought not to have asked it. His judgment is so good and\r\nunerring, and accompanied with so cheerful a spirit, that his\r\nconversation is a continual feast, at which he helps some, and is helped\r\nby others, in such a manner, that the equality of society is perfectly\r\nkept up, and every man obliges as much as he is obliged: for it is the\r\ngreatest and justest skill in a man of superior understanding, to know\r\nhow to be on a level with his companions. This sweet disposition runs\r\nthrough all the actions of Sophronius, and makes his company desired by\r\nwomen, without being envied by men. Sophronius would be as just as he\r\nis, if there were no law; and would be as discreet as he is, if there\r\nwere no such thing as calumny.\r\n\r\nIn imitation of this agreeable being, is made that animal we call a\r\nPretty Fellow; who being just able to find out, that what makes\r\nSophronius acceptable, is a natural behaviour; in order to the same\r\nreputation, makes his own an artificial one. Jack Dimple is his perfect\r\nmimic, whereby he is of course the most unlike him of all men living.\r\nSophronius just now passed into the inner room directly forward: Jack\r\ncomes as fast after as he can for the right and left looking-glass, in\r\nwhich he had but just approved himself by a nod at each, and marched on.\r\nHe will meditate within for half an hour, till he thinks he is not\r\ncareless enough in his air, and come back to the mirror to recollect his\r\nforgetfulness.\r\n\r\n\r\nWill's Coffee-house, May 27.\r\n\r\nThis night was acted the comedy, called, \"The Fox\";[249] but I wonder\r\nthe modern writers do not use their interest in the house to suppress\r\nsuch representations. A man that has been at this, will hardly like any\r\nother play during the season: therefore I humbly move, that the\r\nwritings, as well as dresses, of the last age, should give way to the\r\npresent fashion. We are come into a good method enough (if we were not\r\ninterrupted in our mirth by such an apparition as a play of Jonson's) to\r\nbe entertained at more ease, both to the spectator and the writer, than\r\nin the days of old. It is no difficulty to get hats, and swords, and\r\nwigs, and shoes, and everything else, from the shops in town, and make a\r\nman show himself by his habit, without more ado, to be a counsellor, a\r\nfop, a courtier, or a citizen, and not be obliged to make those\r\ncharacters talk in different dialects to be distinguished from each\r\nother. This is certainly the surest and best way of writing: but such a\r\nplay as this makes a man for a month after overrun with criticism, and\r\ninquire, what every man on the stage said? What had such a one to do to\r\nmeddle with such a thing? How came the other, who was bred after such a\r\nmanner, to speak so like a man conversant among a different people?\r\nThese questions rob us of all our pleasure; for at this rate, no one\r\nsentence in a play should be spoken by any one character, which could\r\npossibly enter into the head of any other man represented in it; but\r\nevery sentiment should be peculiar to him only who utters it. Laborious\r\nBen's works will bear this sort of inquisition; but if the present\r\nwriters were thus examined, and the offences against this rule cut out,\r\nfew plays would be long enough for the whole evening's entertainment.\r\nBut I don't know how they did in those old times: this same Ben Jonson\r\nhas made every one's passion in this play be towards money, and yet not\r\none of them expresses that desire, or endeavours to obtain it any way\r\nbut what is peculiar to him only: one sacrifices his wife, another his\r\nprofession, another his posterity from the same motive; but their\r\ncharacters are kept so skilfully apart, that it seems prodigious their\r\ndiscourses should rise from the invention of the same author. But the\r\npoets are a nest of hornets, and I'll drive these thoughts no farther,\r\nbut must mention some hard treatment I am like to meet with from my\r\nbrother-writers. I am credibly informed, that the author of a play,\r\ncalled, \"Love in a Hollow Tree,\"[250] has made some remarks upon my late\r\ndiscourse on \"The Naked Truth.\"[251] I cannot blame a gentleman for\r\nwriting against any error; it is for the good of the learned world. But\r\nI would have the thing fairly left between us two, and not under the\r\nprotection of patrons. But my intelligence is, that he has dedicated his\r\ntreatise to the Honourable Mr. Ed----d H----rd.[252]\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom my own Apartment, May 27.\r\n\r\n\"_To Isaac Bickerstaff, Esq._\r\n\r\n\"York, May 16, 1709.\r\n\r\n\"SIR,\r\n\r\n\"Being convinced as the whole world is, how infallible your predictions\r\nare, and having the honour to be your near relation, of the Staffian\r\nfamily, I was under great concern at one of your predictions relating to\r\nyourself, wherein you foretold your own death would happen on the 17th\r\ninstant, unless it were prevented by the assistance of well-disposed\r\npeople:[253] I have therefore prevailed on my own modesty to send you a\r\npiece of news, which may serve instead of Goddard's Drops,[254] to keep\r\nyou alive for two days, till nature be able to recover itself, or till\r\nyou meet with some better help from other hands. Therefore, without\r\nfurther ceremony, I will go on to relate a singular adventure just\r\nhappened in the place where I am writing, wherein it may be highly\r\nuseful for the public to be informed.[255]\r\n\r\n\"Three young ladies of our town were on Saturday last indicted for\r\nwitchcraft. The witnesses against the first deposed upon oath before\r\nJustice Bindover, that she kept spirits locked up in velvets, which\r\nsometimes appeared in flames of blue fire; that she used magical herbs,\r\nwith some of which she drew in hundreds of men daily to her, who went\r\nout from her presence all inflamed, their mouths parched, and a hot\r\nsteam issuing from them, attended with a grievous stench; that many of\r\nthe said men were by the force of that herb metamorphosed into swine,\r\nand lay wallowing in the kennels for twenty-four hours, before they\r\ncould reassume their shapes or their senses.\r\n\r\n\"It was proved against the second, that she cut off by night the limbs\r\nfrom dead bodies that were hanged, and was seen to dig holes in the\r\nground, to mutter some conjuring words, and bury pieces of the flesh,\r\nafter the usual manner of witches.\r\n\r\n\"The third was accused for a notorious piece of sorcery, long practised\r\nby hags, of moulding up pieces of dough into the shapes of men, women,\r\nand children; then heating them at a gentle fire, which had a\r\nsympathetic power to torment the bowels of those in the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\n\"This was the sum of what was objected against the three ladies, who\r\nindeed had nothing to say in their own defence, but downright denying\r\nthe facts, which is like to avail very little when they come upon their\r\ntrials.\r\n\r\n\"But the parson of our parish, a strange refractory man, will believe\r\nnothing of all this; so that the whole town cries out, 'Shame! that one\r\nof his coat should be such an atheist;' and design to complain of him to\r\nthe bishop. He goes about very oddly to solve the matter. He supposes,\r\nthat the first of these ladies keeping a brandy and tobacco shop, the\r\nfellows went out smoking, and got drunk towards evening, and made\r\nthemselves beasts. He says, the second is a butcher's daughter, and\r\nsometimes brings a quarter of mutton from the slaughter-house overnight\r\nagainst a market-day, and once buried a bit of beef in the ground, as a\r\nknown receipt to cure warts on her hands. The parson affirms, that the\r\nthird sells gingerbread, which, to please the children, she is forced to\r\nstamp with images before it is baked; and if it burns their guts, it is\r\nbecause they eat too much, or do not drink after it.\r\n\r\n\"These are the answers he gives to solve this wonderful phenomenon; upon\r\nwhich I shall not animadvert, but leave it among the philosophers: and\r\nso wishing you all success in your undertakings for the amendment of the\r\nworld, I remain,\r\n\r\n\"Dear Cousin,\r\n\r\n\"Your most affectionate Kinsman,\r\n\r\n\"and humble Servant,\r\n\r\n                                        \"EPHRAIM BEDSTAFF.\"\r\n\r\n\"P.S.--Those who were condemned to death among the Athenians, were\r\nobliged to take a dose of poison, which made them die upwards, seizing\r\nfirst upon their feet, making them cold and insensible, and so ascending\r\ngradually, till it reached the vital parts. I believe your death, which\r\nyou foretold would happen on the 17th instant, will fall out the same\r\nway, and that your distemper hath already seized on you, and makes\r\nprogress daily. The lower part of you, that is, the advertisements,[256]\r\nis dead; and these have risen for these ten days last past, so that they\r\nnow take up almost a whole paragraph. Pray, sir, do your endeavour to\r\ndrive this distemper as much as possible to the extreme parts, and keep\r\nit there, as wise folks do the gout; for if it once gets into your\r\nstomach, it will soon fly up into your head, and you are a dead man.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSt. James's Coffee-house, May 27.\r\n\r\nWe hear from Leghorn, that Sir Edward Whitaker, with five men-of-war,\r\nfour transports, and two fire-ships, was arrived at that port, and\r\nAdmiral Byng was suddenly expected. Their squadrons being joined, they\r\ndesign to sail directly for Final, to transport the reinforcements,\r\nlodged in those parts, to Barcelona.\r\n\r\nThey write from Milan, that Count Thaun arrived there on the 16th\r\ninstant, N.S., and proceeded on his journey to Turin on the 21st, in\r\norder to concert such measures with his royal highness, as shall appear\r\nnecessary for the operations of the ensuing campaign.\r\n\r\nAdvices from Dauphiny say, that the troops of the Duke of Savoy began\r\nalready to appear in those valleys, whereof he made himself master the\r\nlast year; and that the Duke of Berwick applied himself with all\r\nimaginable diligence to secure the passes of the mountains by ordering\r\nentrenchments to be made towards Briançon, Tourneau, and the Valley of\r\nQueiras. That general has also been at Marseilles and Toulon, to hasten\r\nthe transportation of the corn and provisions designed for his army.\r\n\r\nLetters from Vienna, bearing date May 23, N.S., import, that the\r\nCardinal of Saxe-Zeits and the Prince of Lichtenstein were preparing to\r\nset out for Presburg, to assist at the Diet of the States of Hungary,\r\nwhich is to be assembled at that place on the 25th of this month.\r\nGeneral Heister would shortly appear at the head of his army at\r\nTrentschin, which place is appointed for the general rendezvous of the\r\nImperial forces in Hungary; from whence he will advance to lay siege to\r\nNeuhausel: in the meantime, reinforcements, with a great train of\r\nartillery, are marching the same way. The King of Denmark arrived on the\r\nboth instant at Innspruck, and on the 26th at Dresden, under a triple\r\ndischarge of the artillery of that place; but his Majesty refused the\r\nceremonies of a public entry.\r\n\r\nOur letters from the Upper Rhine say, that the Imperial army began to\r\nform itself at Etlingen; where the respective deputies of the Elector\r\nPalatine, the Prince of Baden Durlach, the Bishopric of Spires, &c. were\r\nassembled, and had taken the necessary measures for the provision of\r\nforage, the security of the country against the incursions of the enemy,\r\nand laying a bridge over the Rhine. Several vessels laden with corn are\r\ndaily passing before Frankfort for the Lower Rhine.\r\n\r\nLetters from Poland inform us, that a detachment of Muscovite cavalry,\r\nunder the command of General Infland, had joined the confederate army;\r\nand the infantry commanded by General Goltz, was expected to come up\r\nwithin few days. These succours will amount to 20,000 men.\r\n\r\nOur last advices from the Hague, dated June the 4th, N.S., say, that\r\nthey expected a courier from the French Court with the ratification of\r\nthe preliminaries that night or the day following. His Grace the Duke of\r\nMarlborough will set out for Brussels on Wednesday or Thursday next, if\r\nthe despatches which are expected from Paris don't alter his\r\nresolutions. Letters from Majorca confirm the honourable capitulation of\r\nthe castle of Alicante, and also the death of the governor,\r\nMajor-General Richards, Colonel Sibourg, and Major Vignolles, who were\r\nall buried in the ruins of that place, by the springing of their great\r\nmine, which did, it seems, more execution than was reported. Monsieur\r\nTorcy passed through Mons in his return, and had there a long conference\r\nwith the Elector of Bavaria; after which, that prince spoke publicly of\r\nthe treatment he had from France with the utmost indignation.\r\n\r\nAny person that shall come publicly abroad in a fantastical habit,\r\ncontrary to the present mode and fashion, except Don Diego\r\nDismallo,[257] or any other out of poverty, shall have his name and\r\ndress inserted in our next.\r\n\r\nN.B.--Mr. How'd'call is desired to leave off those buttons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 249: Ben Jonson's \"Volpone; or, The Fox.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 250: The comedy, \"Love in a Hollow Tree; or, The Lawyer's\r\nFortune,\" was published by William, Lord Viscount Grimston (1683-1756),\r\nwhen he was twenty-two years of age.

Thus a kind look from\r\nLindamira revives in his imagination all the beauteous lawns, green\r\nfields, woods, forests, rivers and solitudes, which he had ever before\r\nseen in picture, description, or real life: and all with this addition,\r\nthat he now sees them with the eyes of a happy lover, as before only\r\nwith those of a common man. You laugh, gentlemen: but consider\r\nyourselves (you common people that were never in love) and compare\r\nyourselves in good humour with yourselves out of humour, and you will\r\nthen acknowledge, that all external objects affect you according to the\r\ndisposition you are in to receive their impressions, and not as those\r\nobjects are in their own nature. How much more shall all that passes\r\nwithin his view and observation, touch with delight a man who is\r\nprepossessed with successful love, which is an assemblage of soft\r\naffections, gay desires, and hopeful resolutions?\" Poor Cynthio went on\r\nat this rate to the crowd about him, without any purpose in his talk,\r\nbut to vent a heart overflowing with sense of success. I wondered what\r\ncould exalt him from the distress in which he had long appeared, to so\r\nmuch alacrity. But my familiar has given me the state of his affairs. It\r\nseems then, that lately coming out of the play-house, his mistress, who\r\nknows he is in her livery (as the manner of insolent beauties is),\r\nresolved to keep him still so, and gave him so much wages, as to\r\ncomplain to him of the crowd she was to pass through. He had his wits\r\nand resolution enough about him to take her hand, and say, he would\r\nattend her to her coach. All the way thither, my good young man\r\nstammered at every word, and stumbled at every step. His mistress,\r\nwonderfully pleased with her triumph, put him to a thousand questions,\r\nto make a man of his natural wit speak with hesitation, and let drop her\r\nfan, to see him recover it awkwardly. This is the whole foundation of\r\nCynthio's recovery to the sprightly air he appears with at present. I\r\ngrew mighty curious to know something more of that lady's affairs, as\r\nbeing amazed how she could dally with an offer of one of his merit and\r\nfortune. I sent Pacolet to her lodgings; he immediately brought me back\r\nthe following letter to her friend and confidante Amanda in the country,\r\nwherein she has opened her heart and all its folds.\r\n\r\n\"DEAR AMANDA,\r\n\r\nThe town grows so empty, that you must expect my letter so too, except\r\nyou will allow me to talk of myself instead of others: you cannot\r\nimagine what pain it is, after a whole day spent in public, to want\r\nyour company, and the ease which friendship allows in being vain to each\r\nother, and speaking all our minds. An account of the slaughter which\r\nthese unhappy eyes have made within ten days last past, would make me\r\nappear too great a tyrant to be allowed in a Christian country. I shall\r\ntherefore confine myself to my principal conquests, which are the hearts\r\nof Beau Frisk, and Jack Freeland, besides Cynthio, who, you know, wore\r\nmy fetters before you went out of town. Shall I tell you my weakness? I\r\nbegin to love Frisk: it is the best-humoured impertinent thing in the\r\nworld: he is always too in waiting, and will certainly carry me off one\r\ntime or other. Freeland's father and mine have been upon treaty without\r\nconsulting me; and Cynthio has been eternally watching my eyes, without\r\napproaching me, my friends, my maid, or any one about me: he hopes to\r\nget me, I believe, as they say the rattlesnake does the squirrel, by\r\nstaring at me till I drop into his mouth. Freeland demands me for a\r\njointure which he thinks deserves me; Cynthio thinks nothing high enough\r\nto be my value: Freeland therefore will take it for no obligation to\r\nhave me; and Cynthio's idea of me, is what will vanish by knowing me\r\nbetter. Familiarity will equally turn the veneration of the one, and the\r\nindifference of the other, into contempt. I will stick therefore to my\r\nold maxim, to have that sort of man, who can have no greater views than\r\nwhat are in my power to give him possession of. The utmost of my dear\r\nFrisk's ambition is, to be thought a man of fashion; and therefore has\r\nbeen so much in mode, as to resolve upon me, because the whole town\r\nlikes me. Thus I choose rather a man who loves me because others do,\r\nthan one who approves me on his own judgment. He that judges for himself\r\nin love, will often change his opinion; but he that follows the sense of\r\nothers, must be constant, as long as a woman can make advances. The\r\nvisits I make, the entertainments I give, and the addresses I receive,\r\nwill be all arguments for me with a man of Frisk's second-hand genius;\r\nbut would be so many bars to my happiness with any other man. However,\r\nsince Frisk can wait, I shall enjoy a summer or two longer, and remain a\r\nsingle woman, in the sublime pleasure of being followed and admired;\r\nwhich nothing can equal, except that of being beloved by you.\r\n\r\n\"I am, &c.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWill's Coffee-house, May 30.\r\n\r\nMy chief business here this evening was to speak to my friends in behalf\r\nof honest Cave Underhill,[259] who has been a comic for three\r\ngenerations: my father[260] admired him extremely when he was a boy.\r\nThere is certainly nature excellently represented in his manner of\r\naction; in which he ever avoided that general fault in players, of doing\r\ntoo much. It must be confessed, he has not the merit of some ingenious\r\npersons now on the stage, of adding to his authors; for the actors were\r\nso dull in the last age, that many of them have gone out of the world,\r\nwithout having ever spoke one word of their own in the theatre. Poor\r\nCave is so mortified, that he quibbles, and tells you, he pretends only\r\nto act a part fit for a man who has one foot in the grave; viz., a\r\ngravedigger. All admirers of true comedy, it is hoped, will have the\r\ngratitude to be present on the last day of his acting, who, if he does\r\nnot happen to please them, will have it even then to say, that it is his\r\nfirst offence.\r\n\r\nBut there is a gentleman here, who says he has it from good hands, that\r\nthere is actually a subscription made by many persons of wit and\r\nquality, for the encouragement of new comedies. This design will very\r\nmuch contribute to the improvement and diversion of the town: but as\r\nevery man is most concerned for himself, I, who am of a saturnine and\r\nmelancholy complexion, cannot but murmur, that there is not an equal\r\ninvitation to write tragedies, having by me, in my book of commonplaces,\r\nenough to enable me to finish a very sad one by the 5th of next month. I\r\nhave the farewell of a general, with a truncheon in his hand, dying for\r\nlove, in six lines. I have the principles of a politician (who does all\r\nthe mischief in the play) together with his declaration on the vanity of\r\nambition in his last moments, expressed in a page and a half. I have all\r\nmy oaths ready, and my similes want nothing but application. I won't\r\npretend to give you an account of the plot, it being the same design\r\nupon which all tragedies have been writ for several years last past; and\r\nfrom the beginning of the first scene, the frequenters of the house may\r\nknow, as well as the author, when the battle is to be fought, the lady\r\nto yield, and the hero to proceed to his wedding and coronation. Besides\r\nthese advantages which I have in readiness, I have an eminent tragedian\r\nvery much my friend, who shall come in, and go through the whole five\r\nacts, without troubling me for one sentence, whether he is to kill or be\r\nkilled, love or be loved, win battles or lose them, or whatever other\r\ntragical performance I shall please to assign him.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom my own Apartment, May 30.\r\n\r\nI have this day received a letter subscribed \"Fidelia,\" that gives me an\r\naccount of an enchantment under which a young lady suffers, and desires\r\nmy help to exorcise her from the power of the sorcerer. Her lover is a\r\nrake of sixty; the lady a virtuous woman of twenty-five: her relations\r\nare to the last degree afflicted, and amazed at this irregular passion:\r\ntheir sorrow I know not how to remove, but can their astonishment; for\r\nthere is no spirit in woman half so prevalent as that of contradiction,\r\nwhich is the sole cause of her perseverance. Let the whole family go\r\ndressed in a body, and call the bride to-morrow morning to her nuptials,\r\nand I'll undertake, the inconstant will forget her lover in the midst of\r\nall his aches. But if this expedient does not succeed, I must be so just\r\nto the young lady's distinguishing sense, as to applaud her choice. A\r\nfine young woman, at last, is but what is due from fate to an honest\r\nfellow, who has suffered so unmercifully by the sex; and I think we\r\ncannot enough celebrate her heroic virtue, who (like the patriot that\r\nended a pestilence by plunging himself into a gulf) gives herself up to\r\ngorge that dragon which has devoured so many virgins before her.\r\n\r\nA letter directed to \"Isaac Bickerstaff, Esq.; astrologer and physician\r\nin ordinary to her Majesty's subjects of Great Britain, with respect,\"\r\nis come to hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 258: See Nos. 1, 5, 35, 85.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 259: The following advertisement appeared in Nos. 20 and 22:\r\n\"Mr. Cave Underhill, the famous comedian in the reigns of Charles II.,\r\nKing James II., King William and Queen Mary, and her present Majesty\r\nQueen Anne; but now not able to perform so often as heretofore in the\r\nplayhouse, and having had losses to the value of near £2500, is to have\r\nthe tragedy of 'Hamlet' acted for his benefit, on Friday, the 3rd of\r\nJune next, at the Theatre Royal in Drury Lane, in which he is to perform\r\nhis original part, the Grave-maker. Tickets may be had at the Mitre\r\nTavern in Fleet Street.\" Colley Cibber says that Underhill was\r\nparticularly admired in the character of the Grave-digger; and he adds:\r\n\"Underhill was a correct and natural comedian; his particular excellence\r\nwas in characters that may be called still-life; I mean the stiff, the\r\nheavy, and the stupid; to these he gave the exactest and most expressive\r\ncolours, and in some of them looked as if it were not in the power of\r\nhuman passions to alter a feature of him. A countenance of wood could\r\nnot be more fixed than his, when the blockhead of a character required\r\nit; his face was full and long; from his crown to the end of his nose\r\nwas the shorter half of it, so that the disproportion of his lower\r\nfeatures, when soberly composed, threw him into the most lumpish, moping\r\nmortal, that ever made beholders merry; not but, at other times, he\r\ncould be wakened into spirit equally ridiculous.\" Genest says that\r\nUnderhill acted again as the Grave-digger on Feb. 23, 1710, at Drury\r\nLane.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 260: \"Grandfather\" (folio).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 23.

I pretended, when I first set\r\nup, to astrology only; but I am told, I have deep skill also in\r\nmedicine. I am applied to now by a gentleman for my advice in behalf of\r\nhis wife, who, upon the least matrimonial difficulty, is excessively\r\ntroubled with fits, and can bear no manner of passion without falling\r\ninto immediate convulsions. I must confess, it is a case I have known\r\nbefore, and remember the party was recovered by certain words pronounced\r\nin the midst of the fit by the learned doctor who performed the cure.\r\nThese ails have usually their beginning from the affections of the mind:\r\ntherefore you must have patience to let me give you an instance, whereby\r\nyou may discern the cause of the distemper, and then proceed in the cure\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\nA fine town lady was married to a gentleman of ancient descent in one of\r\nthe counties of Great Britain, who had good humour to a weakness, and\r\nwas that sort of person, of whom it is usually said, he is no man's\r\nenemy but his own: one who had too much tenderness of soul to have any\r\nauthority with his wife; and she too little sense to give him authority\r\nfor that reason. His kind wife observed this temper in him, and made\r\nproper use of it. But knowing it was below a gentlewoman to wrangle, she\r\nresolved upon an expedient to save decorum, and wear her dear to her\r\npoint at the same time. She therefore took upon her to govern him, by\r\nfalling into fits whenever she was repulsed in a request, or\r\ncontradicted in a discourse. It was a fish-day, when in the midst of her\r\nhusband's good humour at table, she bethought herself to try her\r\nproject. She made signs that she had swallowed a bone. The man grew pale\r\nas ashes, and ran to her assistance, calling for drink. \"No, my dear,\"\r\nsaid she, recovering, \"it is down; don't be frightened.\" This accident\r\nbetrayed his softness enough. The next day she complained, a lady's\r\nchariot, whose husband had not half his estate, had a crane-neck, and\r\nhung with twice the air that hers did. He answered, \"Madam, you know my\r\nincome; you know I have lost two coach-horses this spring.\"--Down she\r\nfell.--\"Hartshorn! Betty, Susan, Alice, throw water in her face.\" With\r\nmuch care and pains she was at last brought to herself, and the vehicle\r\nin which she visited was amended in the nicest manner, to prevent\r\nrelapses; but they frequently happened during that husband's whole life,\r\nwhich he had the good fortune to end in few years after. The\r\ndisconsolate soon pitched upon a very agreeable successor, whom she very\r\nprudently designed to govern by the same method. This man knew her\r\nlittle arts, and resolved to break through all tenderness, and be\r\nabsolute master, as soon as occasion offered. One day it happened, that\r\na discourse arose about furniture: he was very glad of the occasion, and\r\nfell into an invective against china,[261] protesting, he would never\r\nlet five pounds more of his money be laid out that way as long as he\r\nbreathed. She immediately fainted--he starts up as amazed, and calls for\r\nhelp--the maids ran to the closet--he chafes her face, bends her\r\nforwards, and beats the palms of her hands: her convulsions increase,\r\nand down she tumbles on the floor, where she lies quite dead, in spite\r\nof what the whole family, from the nursery to the kitchen, could do for\r\nher relief.\r\n\r\nWhile every servant was thus helping or lamenting their mistress, he,\r\nfixing his cheek to hers, seemed to be following her in a trance of\r\nsorrow; but secretly whispers her, \"My dear, this will never do: what is\r\nwithin my power and fortune, you may always command, but none of your\r\nartifices: you are quite in other hands than those you passed these\r\npretty passions upon.\" This made her almost in the condition she\r\npretended; her convulsions now came thicker, nor was she to be held\r\ndown. The kind man doubles his care, helps the servants to throw water\r\nin her face by full quarts; and when the sinking part of the fit came\r\nagain, \"Well, my dear,\" said he, \"I applaud your action; but I must take\r\nmy leave of you till you are more sincere with me. Farewell for ever:\r\nyou shall always know where to hear of me, and want for nothing.\" With\r\nthat, he ordered the maids to keep plying her with hartshorn, while he\r\nwent for a physician: he was scarce at the stairhead when she followed;\r\nand pulling him into a closet, thanked him for her cure; which was so\r\nabsolute, that she gave me this relation herself, to be communicated for\r\nthe benefit of all the voluntary invalids of her sex.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom my own Apartment, May 31.\r\n\r\nThe public is not so little my concern, though I am but a student, as\r\nthat I should not interest myself in the present great things in\r\nagitation. I am still of opinion, the French king will sign the\r\npreliminaries. With that view, I have sent him by my familiar the\r\nfollowing epistle, and admonished him, on pain of what I shall say of\r\nhim to future generations, to act with sincerity on this occasion.\r\n\r\n#\"London, May 31.#\r\n\r\n#\"Isaac Bickerstaff, Esq., of Great Britain, to Lewis XIV. of France.#\r\n\r\n\"The surprising news which arrived this day, of your Majesty's having\r\nrefused to sign the treaty your Ministers have in a manner sued for, is\r\nwhat gives ground to this application to your Majesty, from one whose\r\nname, perhaps, is too obscure to have ever reached your territories; but\r\none who, with all the European world, is affected with your\r\ndeterminations. Therefore, as it is mine and the common cause of\r\nmankind, I presume to expostulate with you on this occasion. It will, I\r\ndoubt not, appear to the vulgar extravagant, that the actions of a\r\nmighty prince should be balanced by the censure of a private man, whose\r\napprobation or dislike are equally contemptible in their eyes, when they\r\nregard the thrones of sovereigns. But your Majesty has shown, through\r\nthe whole course of your reign, too great a value for liberal arts to be\r\ninsensible, that true fame lies only in the hands of learned men, by\r\nwhom it is to be transmitted to futurity, with marks of honour or\r\nreproach to the end of time. The date of human life is too short to\r\nrecompense the cares which attend the most private condition: therefore\r\nit is, that our souls are made as it were too big for it, and extend\r\nthemselves in the prospect of a longer existence, in a good fame and\r\nmemory of worthy actions after our decease. The whole race of men have\r\nthis passion in some degree implanted in their bosoms, which is the\r\nstrongest and noblest incitation to honest attempts: but the base use of\r\nthe arts of peace, eloquence, poetry, and all the parts of learning,\r\nhave been possessed by souls so unworthy those faculties, that the names\r\nand appellations of things have been confounded by the labours and\r\nwritings of prostituted men, who have stamped a reputation upon such\r\nactions as are in themselves the objects of contempt and disgrace. This\r\nis that which has misled your Majesty in the conduct of your reign, and\r\nmade that life, which might have been the most imitable, the most to be\r\navoided. To this it is, that the great and excellent qualities of which\r\nyour Majesty is master, are lost in their application; and your Majesty\r\nhas been carrying on for many years the most cruel tyranny, with all the\r\nnoble methods which are used to support a just reign. Thus it is, that\r\nit avails nothing that you are a bountiful master; that you are so\r\ngenerous as to reward even the unsuccessful with honour and riches; that\r\nno laudable action passes unrewarded in your kingdoms; that you have\r\nsearched all nations for obscure merit; in a word, that you are in your\r\nprivate character endowed with every princely quality, when all this is\r\nsubjected to unjust and ill-taught ambition, which to the injury of the\r\nworld, is gilded by those endowments. However, if your Majesty will\r\ncondescend to look into your own soul, and consider all its faculties\r\nand weaknesses with impartiality; if you will but be convinced, that\r\nlife is supported in you by the ordinary methods of food, rest, and\r\nsleep; you would think it impossible that you could ever be so much\r\nimposed on, as to have been wrought into a belief, that so many\r\nthousands of the same make with yourself, were formed by Providence for\r\nno other end, but by the hazard of their very being to extend the\r\nconquests and glory of an individual of their own species. A very little\r\nreflection will convince your Majesty, that such cannot be the intent of\r\nthe Creator; and if not, what horror must it give your Majesty to think\r\nof the vast devastations your ambition has made among your fellow\r\ncreatures? While the warmth of youth, the flattery of crowds, and a\r\ncontinual series of success and triumph, indulged your Majesty in this\r\nallusion of mind, it was less to be wondered at, that you proceeded in\r\nthis mistaken pursuit of grandeur; but when age, disappointments, public\r\ncalamities, personal distempers, and the reverse of all that makes men\r\nforget their true being, are fallen upon you: heavens! is it possible\r\nyou can live without remorse? Can the wretched man be a tyrant? Can\r\ngrief study torments? Can sorrow be cruel?--\r\n\r\n\"Your Majesty will observe, I do not bring against you a railing\r\naccusation; but as you are a strict professor of religion, I beseech\r\nyour Majesty to stop the effusion of blood, by receiving the opportunity\r\nwhich presents itself, for the preservation of your distressed people.\r\nBe no longer so infatuated, as to hope for renown from murder and\r\nviolence: but consider, that the great day will come, in which this\r\nworld and all its glory shall change in a moment: when nature shall\r\nsicken, and the earth and sea give up the bodies committed to them, to\r\nappear before the last tribunal. Will it then, O king! be an answer for\r\nthe lives of millions who have fallen by the sword, 'They perished for\r\nmy glory'? That day will come on, and one like it is immediately\r\napproaching: injured nations advance towards thy habitation: vengeance\r\nhas begun its march, which is to be diverted only by the penitence of\r\nthe oppressor. Awake, O monarch, from thy lethargy! Disdain the abuses\r\nthou hast received: pull down the statue which calls thee immortal: be\r\ntruly great: tear thy purple, and put on sackcloth.\r\n\r\n\"I am,\r\n\r\n\"Thy generous Enemy,\r\n\r\n                                        \"ISAAC BICKERSTAFF.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSt. James's Coffee-house, June 1.\r\n\r\nAdvices from Brussels of the 6th instant, N.S., say, his Highness Prince\r\nEugene had received a letter from Monsieur Torcy, wherein that Minister,\r\nafter many expressions of great respect, acquaints him, that his master\r\nhad absolutely refused to sign the preliminaries to the treaty which he\r\nhad, in his Majesty's behalf, consented to at the Hague. Upon the\r\nreceipt of this intelligence, the face of things at that place were\r\nimmediately altered, and the necessary orders were transmitted to the\r\ntroops (which lay most remote from thence) to move towards the place of\r\nrendezvous with all expedition. The enemy seem also to prepare for the\r\nfield, and have at present drawn together twenty-five thousand men in\r\nthe plains of Lenz. Marshal Villars is at the head of those troops; and\r\nhas given the generals under his command all possible assurances, that\r\nhe will turn the fate of the war to the advantage of his master.\r\n\r\nThey write from the Hague of the 7th, that Monsieur Rouillé had received\r\norders from the Court of France, to signify to the States-General and\r\nthe Ministers of the High Allies, that the king could not consent to the\r\npreliminaries of a treaty of peace, as it was offered to him by Monsieur\r\nTorcy. The great difficulty is the business of Spain, on which\r\nparticular his Ministers seemed only to say, during the treaty, that it\r\nwas not so immediately under their master's direction, as that he could\r\nanswer for its being relinquished by the Duke of Anjou: but now he\r\npositively answers, that he cannot comply with what his Minister has\r\npromised in his behalf, even in such points as are wholly in himself to\r\nact in or not. This has had no other effect, than to give the Alliance\r\nfresh arguments for being diffident of engagements entered into by\r\nFrance. The Pensioner made a report of all which this Minister had\r\ndeclared to the Deputies of the States-General, and all things turn\r\ntowards a vigorous war. The Duke of Marlborough designed to leave the\r\nHague within two days, in order to put himself at the head of the army,\r\nwhich is to assemble on the 17th instant between the Scheldt and the\r\nLis. A fleet of eighty sail, laden with corn from the Baltic, is arrived\r\nin the Texel. The States have sent circular letters to all the\r\nprovinces, to notify this change of affairs, and animate their subjects\r\nto new resolutions in defence of their country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 261: Addison ridiculed the prevalent craze for collecting\r\nchina in No. 10 of the _Lover_; and Swift wrote to Steele, \"What do I\r\nknow whether china is dear or not; I once took a fancy of resolving to\r\ngo mad for it, but now it is off.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 24. [ADDISON.\r\n\r\nFrom _Thursday, June 2_, to _Saturday, June 4_, 1709.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nWhite's Chocolate-house, June 2.\r\n\r\nIn my paper of the 28th of the last month,[262] I mentioned several\r\ncharacters which want explanation to the generality of readers: among\r\nothers, I spoke of a Pretty Fellow; but I have received a kind\r\nadmonition in a letter, to take care that I do not omit to show also\r\nwhat is meant by a Very Pretty Fellow, which is to be allowed as a\r\ncharacter by itself, and a person exalted above the other by a peculiar\r\nsprightliness, as one who, by a distinguishing vigour, outstrips his\r\ncompanions, and has thereby deserved and obtained a particular\r\nappellation, or nickname of familiarity. Some have this distinction from\r\nthe fair sex, who are so generous as to take into their protection those\r\nwho are laughed at by the men, and place them for that reason in degrees\r\nof favour. The chief of this sort is Colonel Brunett, who is a man of\r\nfashion, because he will be so; and practises a very jaunty way of\r\nbehaviour, because he is too careless to know when he offends, and too\r\nsanguine to be mortified if he did know it. Thus the colonel has met\r\nwith a town ready to receive him, and cannot possibly see why he should\r\nnot make use of their favour, and set himself in the first degree of\r\nconversation. Therefore he is very successfully loud among the wits,\r\nfamiliar among the ladies, and dissolute among the rakes. Thus he is\r\nadmitted in one place, because he is so in another; and every man treats\r\nBrunett well, not out of his particular esteem for him, but in respect\r\nto the opinion of others. It is to me a solid pleasure to see the world\r\nthus mistaken on the good-natured side; for it is ten to one but the\r\ncolonel mounts into a general officer, marries a fine lady, and is\r\nmaster of a good estate, before they come to explain upon him. What\r\ngives most delight to me in this observation, is, that all this arises\r\nfrom pure nature, and the colonel can account for his success no more\r\nthan those by whom he succeeds. For these causes and considerations, I\r\npronounce him a true woman's man, and in the first degree, \"a very\r\npretty fellow.\" The next to a man of this universal genius, is one who\r\nis peculiarly formed for the service of the ladies, and his merit\r\nchiefly is to be of no consequence. I am indeed a little in doubt,\r\nwhether he ought not rather to be called a \"very happy,\" than a \"very\r\npretty\" fellow? For he is admitted at all hours: all he says or does,\r\nwhich would offend in another, are passed over in him; and all actions\r\nand speeches which please, doubly please if they come from him: no one\r\nwonders or takes notice when he is wrong; but all admire him when he is\r\nin the right. By the way it is fit to remark, that there are people of\r\nbetter sense than these, who endeavour at this character; but they are\r\nout of nature; and though, with some industry, they get the characters\r\nof fools, they cannot arrive to be \"very,\" seldom to be merely \"pretty\r\nfellows.\" But where nature has formed a person for this station amongst\r\nmen, he is gifted with a peculiar genius for success, and his very\r\nerrors and absurdities contribute to it; this felicity attending him to\r\nhis life's end. For it being in a manner necessary that he should be of\r\nno consequence, he is as well in old age as youth; and I know a man,\r\nwhose son has been some years a pretty fellow, who is himself at this\r\nhour a \"very\" pretty fellow. One must move tenderly in this place, for\r\nwe are now in the ladies' lodgings, and speaking of such as are\r\nsupported by their influence and favour; against which there is not,\r\nneither ought there to be, any dispute or observation. But when we come\r\ninto more free air, one may talk a little more at large. Give me leave\r\nthen to mention three, whom I do not doubt but we shall see make\r\nconsiderable figures; and these are such as, for their Bacchanalian\r\nperformances, must be admitted into this order. They are three brothers\r\nlately landed from Holland: as yet, indeed, they have not made their\r\npublic entry, but lodge and converse at Wapping. They have merited\r\nalready on the waterside particular titles: the first is called\r\nHogshead; the second Culverin; and the third Musket. This fraternity is\r\npreparing for our end of the town by their ability in the exercises of\r\nBacchus, and measure their time and merit by liquid weight, and power\r\nof drinking. Hogshead is a prettier fellow than Culverin by two quarts,\r\nand Culverin than Musket by a full pint. It is to be feared, Hogshead is\r\nso often too full, and Culverin overloaded, that Musket will be the only\r\nlasting \"very\" pretty fellow of the three.[263] A third sort of this\r\ndenomination are such as, by very daring adventures in love, have\r\npurchased to themselves renown and new names; as, Joe Carry, for his\r\nexcessive strength and vigour; Tom Drybones, for his generous loss of\r\nyouth and health; and Cancrum, for his meritorious rottenness. These\r\ngreat and leading spirits are proposed to all such of our British youth\r\nas would arrive at perfection in these different kinds; and if their\r\nparts and accomplishments were well imitated, it is not doubted but that\r\nour nation would soon excel all others in wit and arts, as they already\r\ndo in arms.\r\n\r\nN.B.--The gentleman who stole Betty Pepin,[264] may own it, for he is\r\nallowed to be a \"very\" pretty fellow.\r\n\r\n#But we must proceed to the explanation of other terms in our writings.#\r\n\r\nTo know what a Toast is in the country, gives as much perplexity as she\r\nherself does in town: and, indeed, the learned differ very much upon the\r\noriginal of this word, and the acceptation of it among the moderns.\r\nHowever, it is by all agreed to have a joyous and cheerful import. A\r\ntoast in a cold morning, heightened by nutmeg, and sweetened with sugar,\r\nhas for many ages been given to our rural dissenters of justice, before\r\nthey entered upon causes, and has been of great and politic use to take\r\noff the severity of their sentences; but has indeed been remarkable for\r\none ill effect, that it inclines those who use it immoderately, to speak\r\nLatin, to the admiration, rather than information, of an audience. This\r\napplication of \"a toast\" makes it very obvious, that the word may,\r\nwithout a metaphor, be understood as an apt name for a thing which\r\nraises us in the most sovereign degree. But many of the wits of the last\r\nage will assert, that the word, in its present sense, was known among\r\nthem in their youth, and had its rise from an accident at the town of\r\nBath, in the reign of King Charles II. It happened, that on a public day\r\na celebrated beauty of those times was in the Cross Bath, and one of the\r\ncrowd of her admirers took a glass of the water in which the fair one\r\nstood, and drank her health to the company. There was in the place a gay\r\nfellow, half fuddled, who offered to jump in, and swore, though he liked\r\nnot the liquor, he would have the toast. He was opposed in his\r\nresolution; yet this whim gave foundation to the present honour which is\r\ndone to the lady we mention in our liquors, who has ever since been\r\ncalled a \"toast.\" Though this institution had so trivial a beginning, it\r\nis now elevated into a formal order; and that happy virgin who is\r\nreceived and drank to at their meetings, has no more to do in this life,\r\nbut to judge and accept of the first good offer. The manner of her\r\ninauguration is much like that of the choice of a Doge in Venice: it is\r\nperformed by balloting; and when she is so chosen, she reigns\r\nindisputably for that ensuing year; but must be elected anew to prolong\r\nher empire a moment beyond it. When she is regularly chosen, her name is\r\nwritten with a diamond on a drinking-glass.[265] The hieroglyphic of the\r\ndiamond is to show her, that her value is imaginary; and that of the\r\nglass to acquaint her, that her condition is frail, and depends on the\r\nhand which holds her. This wise design admonishes her, neither to\r\noverrate nor depreciate her charms; as well considering and applying,\r\nthat it is perfectly according to the humour and taste of the company,\r\nwhether the toast is eaten, or left as an offal.\r\n\r\nThe foremost of the whole rank of toasts, and the most undisputed in\r\ntheir present empire, are Mrs. Gatty and Mrs. Frontlet: the first, an\r\nagreeable; the second, an awful beauty. These ladies are perfect\r\nfriends, out of a knowledge that their perfections are too different to\r\nstand in competition. He that likes Gatty can have no relish for so\r\nsolemn a creature as Frontlet; and an admirer of Frontlet will call\r\nGatty a maypole-girl. Gatty for ever smiles upon you; and Frontlet\r\ndisdains to see you smile. Gatty's love is a shining quick flame;\r\nFrontlet's a slow wasting fire. Gatty likes the man that diverts her;\r\nFrontlet him who adores her. Gatty always improves the soil in which she\r\ntravels; Frontlet lays waste the country. Gatty does not only smile, but\r\nlaughs at her lover; Frontlet not only looks serious, but frowns at him.\r\nAll the men of wit (and coxcombs their followers) are professed servants\r\nof Gatty: the politicians and pretenders give solemn worship to\r\nFrontlet. Their reign will be best judged of by its duration. Frontlet\r\nwill never be chosen more; and Gatty is a toast for life.\r\n\r\n\r\nSt. James's Coffee-house, June 3.\r\n\r\nLetters from Hamburg of the 7th instant, N.S., inform us, that no art or\r\ncost is omitted to make the stay of his Danish Majesty at Dresden\r\nagreeable; but there are various speculations upon the interview between\r\nKing Augustus and that prince, many putting politic constructions upon\r\nhis Danish Majesty's arrival, at a time when his troops are marching out\r\nof Hungary, with orders to pass through Saxony, where it is given out,\r\nthat they are to be recruited. It is said also, that several Polish\r\nsenators have invited King Augustus to return into Poland. His Majesty\r\nof Sweden, according to the same advices, has passed the Dnieper without\r\nany opposition from the Muscovites, and advances with all possible\r\nexpedition towards Voldinia, where he proposes to join King Stanislaus\r\nand General Cressau.\r\n\r\nWe hear from Berne of the 1st instant, N.S., that there is not a\r\nprovince in France, from whence the Court is not apprehensive of\r\nreceiving accounts of public emotions, occasioned by the want of corn.\r\nThe General Diet of the thirteen cantons is assembled at Baden, but have\r\nnot yet entered upon business, so that the affair of Tockenburg is yet\r\nat a stand.\r\n\r\nLetters from the Hague, dated the 11th instant, N.S., advise that\r\nMonsieur Rouillé having acquainted the Ministers of the Allies, that his\r\nmaster had refused to ratify the preliminaries of a treaty adjusted with\r\nMonsieur Torcy, set out for Paris on Sunday morning. The same day the\r\nforeign Ministers met a committee of the States-General, where Monsieur\r\nvan Hessen opened the business upon which they were assembled, and in a\r\nvery warm discourse laid before them the conduct of France in the late\r\nnegotiations, representing the abject manner in which she had laid open\r\nher own distresses, which reduced her to a compliance with the demands\r\nof all the Allies, and the mean manner in receding from those points to\r\nwhich her Minister had consented. The respective Ministers of each\r\npotentate of the Alliance severally expressed their resentment of the\r\nfaithless behaviour of the French, and gave each other mutual assurances\r\nof the constancy and resolution of their principles to proceed with the\r\nutmost vigour against the common enemy. His Grace the Duke of\r\nMarlborough set out from the Hague on the 9th, in the afternoon, and lay\r\nthat night at Rotterdam, from whence at four the next morning he\r\nproceeded towards Antwerp, with design to reach Ghent as on this day.\r\nAll the troops in the Low Countries are in motion towards the general\r\nrendezvous between the Scheldt and Lis, and the whole army will be\r\nformed on the 12th instant; and it is said that on the 14th they will\r\nadvance towards the enemy's country. In the meantime the Marshal de\r\nVillars has assembled the French army between Lens, la Bassée, and\r\nDouay.\r\n\r\nYesterday morning Sir John Norris[266] with the squadron under his\r\ncommand, sailed from the Downs for Holland.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom my own Apartment, June 3.\r\n\r\nI have the honour of the following letter from a gentleman whom I\r\nreceive into my family, and order the heralds at arms to enroll him\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\n\"MR. BICKERSTAFF,\r\n\r\n\"Though you have excluded me the honour of your family, yet I have\r\nventured to correspond with the same great persons as yourself, and have\r\nwrote this post to the King of France; though I'm in a manner unknown\r\nin his country, and have not been seen there these many months.\r\n\r\n#\"'To Lewis le Grand.#\r\n\r\n    \"'Though in your country I'm unknown,\r\n      Yet, sir, I must advise you;\r\n    Of late so poor and mean you're grown,\r\n      That all the world despise you.\r\n\r\n    Here vermin eat your majesty,\r\n      There meagre subjects stand unfed;\r\n    What surer signs of poverty,\r\n      Than many lice, and little bread?\r\n\r\n    Then, sir, the present minute choose,\r\n      Our armies are advanced;\r\n    Those terms you at the Hague refuse,\r\n      At Paris won't be granted.\r\n\r\n    Consider this, and Dunkirk raze,\r\n      And Anna's title own;\r\n    Send one Pretender out to graze,\r\n      And call the other home.'\r\n\r\n\"Your humble Servant,\r\n\r\n                                        \"BREAD, THE STAFF OF LIFE.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 262: No. 21.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 263: It would seem from the passage in the _Examiner_ (vol.\r\niii.

[STEELE.\r\n\r\nFrom _Saturday, June 4_, to _Tuesday, June 7_, 1709.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nWhite's Chocolate-house, June 6.\r\n\r\nA letter from a young lady, written in the most passionate terms\r\n(wherein she laments the misfortune of a gentleman, her lover, who was\r\nlately wounded in a duel), has turned my thoughts to that subject, and\r\ninclined me to examine into the causes which precipitate men into so\r\nfatal a folly.[267] And as it has been proposed to treat of subjects of\r\ngallantry in the article from hence, and no one point of nature is more\r\nproper to be considered by the company who frequent this place, than\r\nthat of duels, it is worth our consideration to examine into this\r\nchimerical groundless humour, and to lay every other thought aside, till\r\nwe have stripped it of all its false pretences to credit and reputation\r\namongst men. But I must confess, when I consider what I am going about,\r\nand run over in my imagination all the endless crowd of men of honour\r\nwho will be offended at such a discourse, I am undertaking, methinks, a\r\nwork worthy an invulnerable hero in romance, rather than a private\r\ngentleman with a single rapier; but as I am pretty well acquainted by\r\ngreat opportunities with the nature of man, and know of a truth, that\r\nall men fight against their will, the danger vanishes, and resolution\r\nrises upon this subject. For this reason I shall talk very freely on a\r\ncustom which all men wish exploded, though no man has courage enough to\r\nresist it. But there is one unintelligible word which I fear will\r\nextremely perplex my dissertation, and I confess to you I find very\r\nhard to explain, which is, the term \"satisfaction.\" An honest country\r\ngentleman had the misfortune to fall into company with two or three\r\nmodern men of honour, where he happened to be very ill-treated; and one\r\nof the company being conscious of his offence, sends a note to him in\r\nthe morning, and tells him, he was ready to give him satisfaction. \"This\r\nis fine doing,\" says the plain fellow: \"last night he sent me away\r\ncursedly out of humour, and this morning he fancies it would be a\r\nsatisfaction to be run through the body.\" As the matter at present\r\nstands, it is not to do handsome actions denominates a man of honour; it\r\nis enough if he dares to defend ill ones. Thus you often see a common\r\nsharper in competition with a gentleman of the first rank; though all\r\nmankind is convinced, that a fighting gamester is only a pickpocket with\r\nthe courage of a highwayman. One cannot with any patience reflect on the\r\nunaccountable jumble of persons and things in this town and nation,\r\nwhich occasions very frequently, that a brave man falls by a hand below\r\nthat of the common hangman, and yet his executioner escapes the clutches\r\nof the hangman for doing it. I shall therefore hereafter consider, how\r\nthe bravest men in other ages and nations have behaved themselves upon\r\nsuch incidents as we decide by combat; and show, from their practice,\r\nthat this resentment neither has its foundation from true reason, nor\r\nsolid fame; but is an imposture,[268] made up of cowardice, falsehood,\r\nand want of understanding. For this work, a good history of quarrels\r\nwould be very edifying to the public, and I apply myself to the town for\r\nparticulars and circumstances within their knowledge, which may serve to\r\nembellish the dissertation with proper cuts. Most of the quarrels I have\r\never known, have proceeded from some valiant coxcomb's persisting in\r\nthe wrong, to defend some prevailing folly, and preserve himself from\r\nthe ingenuity of owning a mistake.[269]\r\n\r\nBy this means it is called, \"giving a man satisfaction,\" to urge your\r\noffence against him with your sword; which puts me in mind of Peter's\r\norder to the keeper, in the \"Tale of a Tub\": \"If you neglect to do all\r\nthis, damn you and your generation for ever; and so we bid you heartily\r\nfarewell.\"[270] If the contradiction in the very terms of one of our\r\nchallenges were as well explained, and turned into plain English, would\r\nit not run after this manner?\r\n\r\n\"SIR,\r\n\r\n\"Your extraordinary behaviour last night, and the liberty you were\r\npleased to take with me, makes me this morning give you this, to tell\r\nyou, because you are an ill-bred puppy, I will meet you in Hyde Park an\r\nhour hence; and because you want both breeding and humanity, I desire\r\nyou would come with a pistol in your hand, on horseback, and endeavour\r\nto shoot me through the head; to teach you more manners. If you fail of\r\ndoing me this pleasure, I shall say, you are a rascal on every post in\r\ntown: and so, sir, if you will not injure me more, I shall never forgive\r\nwhat you have done already. Pray sir, do not fail of getting everything\r\nready, and you will infinitely oblige,\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\r\n\r\n\"Your most obedient,\r\n\r\n\"humble Servant, &c.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom my own Apartment, June 6.\r\n\r\nAmong the many employments I am necessarily put upon by my friends, that\r\nof giving advice is the most unwelcome to me; and indeed, I am forced to\r\nuse a little art in the matter; for some people will ask counsel of you,\r\nwhen they have already acted what they tell you is still under\r\ndeliberation. I had almost lost a very good friend the other day, who\r\ncame to know how I liked his design to marry such a lady. I answered,\r\n\"By no means; and I must be positive against it, for very solid reasons,\r\nwhich are not proper to communicate.\" \"Not proper to communicate!\" said\r\nhe with a grave air, \"I will know the bottom of this.\" I saw him moved,\r\nand knew from thence he was already determined; therefore evaded it by\r\nsaying, \"To tell you the truth, dear Frank, of all women living, I would\r\nhave her myself.\" \"Isaac,\" said he, \"thou art too late, for we have been\r\nboth one these two months.\" I learned this caution by a gentleman's\r\nconsulting me formerly about his son. He railed at his damned\r\nextravagance, and told me, in a very little time, he would beggar him by\r\nthe exorbitant bills which came from Oxford every quarter. \"Make the\r\nrogue bite upon the bridle,\"[271] said I, \"pay none of his bills, it\r\nwill but encourage him to further trespasses.\" He looked plaguy sour at\r\nme. His son soon after sent up a paper of verses, forsooth, in print, on\r\nthe last public occasion; upon which, he is convinced the boy has parts,\r\nand a lad of spirit is not to be too much cramped in his maintenance,\r\nlest he take ill courses. Neither father nor son can ever since endure\r\nthe sight of me. These sort of people ask opinions, only out of the\r\nfulness of their heart on the subject of their perplexity, and not from\r\na desire of information. There is nothing so easy as to find out which\r\nopinion the person in doubt has a mind to; therefore the sure way is to\r\ntell him, that is certainly to be chosen. Then you are to be very clear\r\nand positive; leave no handle for scruple. \"Bless me! sir, there is no\r\nroom for a question.\" This rivets you into his heart; for you at once\r\napplaud his wisdom, and gratify his inclination. However, I had too much\r\nbowels to be insincere to a man who came yesterday to know of me, with\r\nwhich of two eminent men in the City he should place his son? Their\r\nnames are Paulo and Avaro.[272] This gave me much debate with myself,\r\nbecause not only the fortune of the youth, but his virtue also depended\r\nupon this choice. The men are equally wealthy; but they differ in the\r\nuse and application of their riches, which you immediately see upon\r\nentering their doors.\r\n\r\nThe habitation of Paulo has at once the air of a nobleman and a\r\nmerchant. You see the servants act with affection to their master, and\r\nsatisfaction in themselves: the master meets you with an open\r\ncountenance, full of benevolence and integrity: your business is\r\ndespatched with that confidence and welcome which always accompanies\r\nhonest minds: his table is the image of plenty and generosity, supported\r\nby justice and frugality. After we had dined here, our affair was to\r\nvisit Avaro: out comes an awkward fellow with a careful countenance;\r\n\"Sir, would you speak with my master? May I crave your name?\" After the\r\nfirst preambles, he leads us into a noble solitude, a great house that\r\nseemed uninhabited; but from the end of the spacious hall moves towards\r\nus Avaro, with a suspicious aspect, as if he believed us thieves; and as\r\nfor my part, I approached him as if I knew him a cut-purse. We fell\r\ninto discourse of his noble dwelling, and the great estate all the world\r\nknew he had to enjoy in it: and I, to plague him, fell a commending\r\nPaulo's way of living. \"Paulo,\" answered Avaro, \"is a very good man; but\r\nwe who have smaller estates, must cut our coat according to our cloth.\"\r\n\"Nay,\" says I, \"every man knows his own circumstance best; you are in\r\nthe right, if you haven't wherewithal.\" He looked very sour (for it is,\r\nyou must know, the utmost vanity of a mean-spirited rich man to be\r\ncontradicted, when he calls himself poor). But I was resolved to vex\r\nhim, by consenting to all he said; the main design of which was, that he\r\nwould have us find out, he was one of the wealthiest men in London, and\r\nlived like a beggar. We left him, and took a turn on the 'Change. My\r\nfriend was ravished with Avaro. \"This,\" said he, \"is certainly a sure\r\nman.\" I contradicted him with much warmth, and summed up their different\r\ncharacters as well as I could. \"This Paulo,\" said I, \"grows wealthy by\r\nbeing a common good; Avaro, by being a general evil: Paulo has the art,\r\nAvaro the craft of trade. When Paulo gains, all men he deals with are\r\nthe better: whenever Avaro profits, another certainly loses. In a word,\r\nPaulo is a citizen, and Avaro a cit.\" I convinced my friend, and carried\r\nthe young gentleman the next day to Paulo, where he will learn the way\r\nboth to gain, and enjoy a good fortune. And though I cannot say, I have,\r\nby keeping him from Avaro, saved him from the gallows, I have prevented\r\nhis deserving it every day he lives: for with Paulo he will be an honest\r\nman, without being so for fear of the law; as with Avaro, he would have\r\nbeen a villain within the protection of it.\r\n\r\n\r\nSt. James's Coffee-house, June 6.\r\n\r\nWe hear from Vienna of the 1st instant, that Baron Imoff, who attended\r\nher Catholic Majesty with the character of Envoy from the Duke of\r\nWolfembuttel, was returned thither. That Minister brought an account,\r\nthat Major-general Stanhope, with the troops which embarked at Naples,\r\nwas returned to Barcelona. We hear from Berlin, by advices of the 8th\r\ninstant, that his Prussian Majesty had received intelligence from his\r\nMinister at Dresden, that the King of Denmark desired to meet his\r\nMajesty at Magdeburg. The King of Prussia has sent answer, that his\r\npresent indisposition will not admit of so great a journey; but has sent\r\nthe king a very pressing invitation to come to Berlin or Potsdam. These\r\nadvices say, that the Minister of the King of Sweden has produced a\r\nletter from his master to the King of Poland, dated from Batitzau the\r\n30th of March, O.S., wherein he acquaints him, that he has been\r\nsuccessful against the Muscovites in all the occasions which have\r\nhappened since his march into their country. Great numbers have revolted\r\nto the Swedes since General Mazeppa went over to that side; and as many\r\nas have done so, have taken solemn oaths to adhere to the interests of\r\nhis Swedish Majesty.\r\n\r\nAdvices from the Hague of the 14th instant, N.S., say, that all things\r\ntended to a vigorous and active campaign; the Allies having strong\r\nresentments against the late behaviour of the Court of France; and the\r\nFrench using all possible endeavours to animate their men to defend\r\ntheir country against a victorious and exasperated enemy. Monsieur\r\nRouillé had passed through Brussels without visiting either the Duke of\r\nMarlborough or Prince Eugene, who were both there at that time. The\r\nStates have met, and publicly declared their satisfaction in the\r\nconduct of their deputies during the whole treaty. Letters from France\r\nsay, that the Court is resolved to put all to the issue of the ensuing\r\ncampaign. In the meantime, they have ordered the preliminary treaty to\r\nbe published, with observation upon each article, in order to quiet the\r\nminds of the people, and persuade them, that it has not been in the\r\npower of the king to procure a peace, but to the diminution of his\r\nMajesty's glory, and the hazard of his dominions. His Grace the Duke of\r\nMarlborough and Prince Eugene arrived at Ghent on Wednesday last, where,\r\nat an assembly of all the general officers, it was thought proper, by\r\nreason of the great rains which have lately fallen, to defer forming a\r\ncamp, or bringing the troops together; but as soon as the weather would\r\npermit, to march upon the enemy with all expedition.[273]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 267: For Steele's other papers on duelling, see Nos. 26, 28,\r\n29, 31, 38, 39.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 268: Something imposed upon us.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 269: \"While this barbarous custom of duelling is tolerated, we\r\nshall never be rid of coxcombs, who will defend their understandings by\r\nthe sword, and force us to bear nonsense on pain of death.\"--(Steele,\r\n_Theatre_, No. 26.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 270: Swift's \"Tale of a Tub,\" sect. 4.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 271: _I.e._, hold him in.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 272: Said to be Bateman and Heathcote, both eminent\r\ncitizens--(_Gentleman's Magazine_, lx. 679.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 273: \"Mr. Bickerstaff has received a letter, dated June 6,\r\nwith the just exceptions against the pretence of persons therein\r\nmentioned, to the name of Pretty Fellows, which shall be taken notice of\r\naccordingly: as likewise, the letter from Anthony Longtail of\r\nCanterbury, concerning the death of Thomas à Becket\" (folio).

To enumerate but a few particulars; there's hardly\r\na coachman I meet with, but desires to be excused taking me, because he\r\nhas had me before. I have compounded two or three rapes; and let out to\r\nhire as many bastards to beggars. I never saw above the first act of a\r\nplay: and as to my courage, it is well known, I have more than once had\r\nsufficient witnesses of my drawing my sword both in tavern and\r\nplayhouse. Dr. Wall[277] is my particular friend; and if it were any\r\nservice to the public to compose the difference between Marten and\r\nSintilaer[278] the pearl-driller, I don't know a judge of more\r\nexperience than myself: for in that I may say with the poet,\r\n\r\n    \"'_Quæ regio in villa nostri non plena laboris?_'[279]\r\n\r\n\"I omit other less particulars, the necessary consequences of greater\r\nactions. But my reason for troubling you at this present is, to put a\r\nstop, if it may be, to an insinuating, increasing set of people, who\r\nsticking to the letter of your treatise, and not to the spirit of it, do\r\nassume the name of 'pretty fellows'; nay, and even get new names, as you\r\nvery well hint. Some of them I have heard calling to one another, as I\r\nhave sat at White's and St. James's, by the names of Betty, Nelly, and\r\nso forth. You see them accost each other with effeminate airs: they have\r\ntheir signs and tokens like freemasons: they rail at women-kind; receive\r\nvisits on their beds in gowns, and do a thousand other unintelligible\r\nprettinesses that I cannot tell what to make of. I therefore heartily\r\ndesire you would exclude all this sort of animals.\r\n\r\n\"There is another matter I am foreseeing an ill consequence from, but\r\nmay be timely prevented by prudence; which is, that for the last\r\nfortnight, prodigious shoals of volunteers have gone over to bully the\r\nFrench, upon hearing the peace was just signing; and this is so true,\r\nthat I can assure you, all engrossing work about the Temple is risen\r\nabove 3_s_. in the pound for want of hands. Now as it is possible some\r\nlittle alteration of affairs may have broken their measures, and that\r\nthey will post back again, I am under the last apprehension, that these\r\nwill, at their return, all set up for 'pretty fellows,' and thereby\r\nconfound all merit and service, and impose on us some new alteration in\r\nour nightcap-wigs[280] and pockets, unless you can provide a particular\r\nclass for them. I cannot apply myself better than to you, and I am sure\r\nI speak the mind of a very great number as deserving as myself.\"\r\n\r\nThe pretensions of this correspondent are worthy a particular\r\ndistinction: he cannot indeed be admitted as a \"pretty,\" but is, what we\r\nmore justly call, a \"smart fellow.\" Never to pay at the playhouse, is an\r\nact of frugality, that lets you into his character. And his expedient in\r\nsending his children a-begging before they can go, are characteristical\r\ninstances that he belongs to this class. I never saw the gentleman; but\r\nI know by his letter, he hangs his cane on his button;[281] and by some\r\nlines of it, he should wear red-heeled shoes;[282] which are essential\r\nparts of the habit belonging to the order of \"smart fellows.\"\r\n\r\nMy familiar is returned with the following letter from the French king:\r\n\r\n\"Versailles, _June 13_, 1709.\r\n\r\n#\"_Louis XIV. to Isaac Bickerstaff, Esq._[283]#\r\n\r\n\"SIR,\r\n\r\n\"I have your epistle, and must take the liberty to say, that there has\r\nbeen a time, when there were generous spirits in Great Britain, who\r\nwould not have suffered my name to be treated with the familiarity you\r\nthink fit to use. I thought liberal men would not be such time-servers,\r\nas to fall upon a man because his friends are not in power. But having\r\nsome concern for what you may transmit to posterity concerning me, I am\r\nwilling to keep terms with you, and make a request to you, which is,\r\nthat you would give my service to the nineteenth century (if ever you or\r\nyours reach to them), and tell them, that I have settled all matters\r\nbetween them and me by Monsieur Boileau. I should be glad to see you\r\nhere.\"\r\n\r\nIt is very odd this prince should offer to invite me into his dominions,\r\nor believe I should accept the invitation. No, no, I remember too well\r\nhow he served an ingenious gentleman, a friend of mine,[284] whom he\r\nlocked up in the Bastille for no reason in the world, but because he was\r\na wit, and feared he might mention him with justice in some of his\r\nwritings. His way is, that all men of sense are preferred, banished, or\r\nimprisoned. He has indeed a sort of justice in him, like that of the\r\ngamesters; if a stander-by sees one at play cheat, he has a right to\r\ncome in for snares, for knowing the mysteries of the game. This is a\r\nvery wise and just maxim; and if I have not left at Mr. Morphew's,\r\ndirected to me, bank bills for £200 on or before this day sevennight, I\r\nshall tell how Tom Cash got his estate. I expect three hundred pounds of\r\nMr. Soilett, for concealing all the money he has lent to himself, and\r\nhis landed friend bound with him, at thirty per cent. at his\r\nscrivener's. Absolute princes make people pay what they please in\r\ndeference to their power: I do not know why I should not do the same,\r\nout of fear or respect to my knowledge. I always preserve decorums and\r\ncivilities to the fair sex: therefore if a certain lady, who left her\r\ncoach at the New Exchange[285] door in the Strand, and whipped down\r\nDurham Yard into a boat with a young gentleman for Fox Hall;[286] I say,\r\nif she will send me word, that I may give the fan which she dropped, and\r\nI found, to my sister Jenny, there shall be no more said of it. I expect\r\nhush-money to be regularly sent for every folly or vice any one commits\r\nin this whole town; and hope I may pretend to deserve it better than a\r\nchamber-maid, or _valet-de-chambre_: they only whisper it to the little\r\nset of their companions; but I can tell it to all men living, or who are\r\nto live. Therefore I desire all my readers to pay their fines, or mend\r\ntheir lives.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhite's Chocolate-house, June 8.\r\n\r\nMy familiar being come from France, with an answer to my letter to Lewis\r\nof that kingdom, instead of going on in a discourse of what he had seen\r\nin that Court, he put on the immediate concern of a guardian, and fell\r\nto inquiring into my thoughts and adventures since his journey. As short\r\nas his stay had been, I confessed I had had many occasions for his\r\nassistance in my conduct; but communicated to him my thoughts of putting\r\nall my force against the horrid and senseless custom of duels. \"If it\r\nwere possible,\" said he, \"to laugh at things in themselves so deeply\r\ntragical as the impertinent profusion of human life, I think I could\r\ndivert you with a figure I saw just after my death, when the philosopher\r\nthrew me, as I told you some days ago, into the pail of water.[287] You\r\nare to know, that when men leave the body, there are receptacles for\r\nthem as soon as they depart, according to the manner in which they lived\r\nand died. At the very instant that I was killed, there came away with me\r\na spirit which had lost its body in a duel. We were both examined. Me,\r\nthe whole assembly looked at with kindness and pity, but at the same\r\ntime with an air of welcome, and consolation: they pronounced me very\r\nhappy, who had died in innocence; and told me, a quite different place\r\nwas allotted to me, than that which was appointed for my companion;\r\nthere being a great distance from the mansions of fools and innocents:\r\n'though at the same time,' said one of the ghosts, there is a great\r\naffinity between an idiot who has been so for long life, and a child who\r\ndeparts before maturity. But this gentleman who has arrived with you is\r\na fool of his own making, is ignorant out of choice, and will fare\r\naccordingly.' The assembly began to flock about him, and one said to\r\nhim, 'Sir, I observed you came into the gate of persons murdered, and I\r\ndesire to know what brought you to your untimely end?' He said, he had\r\nbeen a second. Socrates (who may be said to have been murdered by the\r\ncommonwealth of Athens) stood by, and began to draw near him, in order,\r\nafter his manner, to lead him into a sense of his error by concessions\r\nin his own discourse. 'Sir,' said that divine and amicable spirit, 'what\r\nwas the quarrel?' He answered, 'We shall know very suddenly, when the\r\nprincipal in the business comes, for he was desperately wounded before I\r\nfell.' 'Sir,' said the sage, 'had you an estate?' 'Yes, sir,' the new\r\nguest answered, 'I have left it in a very good condition; I made my will\r\nthe night before this occasion.' 'Did you read it before you signed it?'\r\n'Yes sure, sir,' said the newcomer. Socrates replies, could a man that\r\nwould not give his estate without reading the instrument, dispose of his\r\nlife without asking a question? That illustrious shade turned from him,\r\nand a crowd of impertinent goblins, who had been drolls and parasites in\r\ntheir lifetime, and were knocked on the head for their sauciness, came\r\nabout my fellow-traveller, and made themselves very merry with questions\r\nabout the words 'carte' and 'terce' and other terms of fencers. But his\r\nthoughts began to settle into reflection upon the adventure which had\r\nrobbed him of his late being; and with a wretched sigh, said he, 'How\r\nterrible are conviction and guilt when they come too late for\r\npenitence!'\" Pacolet was going on in this strain, but he recovered from\r\nit, and told me, it was too soon to give my discourse on this subject so\r\nserious a turn; you have chiefly to do with that part of mankind which\r\nmust be led into reflection by degrees, and you must treat this custom\r\nwith humour and raillery to get an audience, before you come to\r\npronounce sentence upon it. There is foundation enough for raising such\r\nentertainments from the practice on this occasion. Don't you know, that\r\noften a man is called out of bed to follow implicitly a coxcomb (with\r\nwhom he would not keep company on any other occasion) to ruin and death?\r\nThen a good list of such as are qualified by the laws of these\r\nuncourteous men of chivalry to enter into combat (who are often persons\r\nof honour without common honesty): these, I say, ranged and drawn up in\r\ntheir proper order, would give an aversion to doing anything in common\r\nwith such as men laugh at and contemn. But to go through this work, you\r\nmust not let your thoughts vary, or make excursions from your theme:\r\nconsider at the same time, that the matter has been often treated by the\r\nablest and greatest writers; yet that must not discourage you; for the\r\nproperest person to handle it, is one who has roved into mixed\r\nconversations, and must have opportunities (which I shall give you) of\r\nseeing these sort of men in their pleasures and gratifications; among\r\nwhich, they pretend to reckon fighting. It was pleasantly enough said of\r\na bully in France, when duels first began to be punished: \"The king has\r\ntaken away gaming, and stage-playing, and now fighting too; how does he\r\nexpect gentlemen shall divert themselves?\"[288]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 274: See Nos. 1, 10, 16.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 275: This letter is probably by Anthony Henley; see\r\nadvertisement at end of No. 25.

[STEELE.\r\n\r\nFrom _Thursday, June 9_, to _Saturday, June 11, 1709_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nWhite's Chocolate-house, June 9.\r\n\r\nPacolet being gone a strolling among the men of the sword, in order to\r\nfind out the secret causes of the frequent disputes we meet with, and\r\nfurnish me with material for my treatise on duelling; I have room left\r\nto go on in my information to my country readers, whereby they may\r\nunderstand the bright people whose memoirs I have taken upon me to\r\nwrite. But in my discourse of the 28th of the last month,[289] I omitted\r\nto mention the most agreeable of all bad characters; and that is, a\r\nRake.\r\n\r\nA Rake is a man always to be pitied; and if he lives, is one day\r\ncertainly reclaimed; for his faults proceed not from choice or\r\ninclination, but from strong passions and appetites, which are in youth\r\ntoo violent for the curb of reason, good sense, good manners, and good\r\nnature: all which he must have by nature and education, before he can be\r\nallowed to be, or have been of this order. He is a poor unwieldy wretch,\r\nthat commits faults out of the redundance of his good qualities. His\r\npity and compassion make him sometimes a bubble to all his fellows, let\r\nthem be never so much below him in understanding. His desires run away\r\nwith him through the strength and force of a lively imagination, which\r\nhurries him on to unlawful pleasures, before reason has power to come in\r\nto his rescue. Thus, with all the good intentions in the world to\r\namendment, this creature sins on against heaven, himself, his friends,\r\nand his country, who all call for a better use of his talents. There is\r\nnot a being under the sun so miserable as this: he goes on in a pursuit\r\nhe himself disapproves, and has no enjoyment but what is followed by\r\nremorse; no relief from remorse, but the repetition of his crime. It is\r\npossible I may talk of this person with too much indulgence; but I must\r\nrepeat it, that I think this a character which is the most the object of\r\npity of any in the world. The man in the pangs of the stone, gout, or\r\nany acute distempers, is not in so deplorable a condition in the eye of\r\nright sense, as he that errs and repents, and repents and errs on. The\r\nfellow with broken limbs justly deserves your alms for his impotent\r\ncondition; but he that cannot use his own reason, is in a much worse\r\nstate; for you see him in miserable circumstances, with his remedy at\r\nthe same time in his own possession, if he would or could use it. This\r\nis the cause, that of all ill characters, the rake has the best quarter\r\nin the world; for when he is himself, and unruffled with intemperance,\r\nyou see his natural faculties exert themselves, and attract an eye of\r\nfavour towards his infirmities. But if we look round us here, how many\r\ndull rogues are there, that would fain be what this poor man hates\r\nhimself for? All the noise towards six in the evening,[290] is caused by\r\nhis mimics and imitators. How ought men of sense to be careful of their\r\nactions, if it were merely from the indignation of feeling themselves\r\nill drawn by such little pretenders? not to say, he that leads, is\r\nguilty of all the actions of his followers: and a rake has imitators\r\nwhom you would never expect should prove so. Second-hand vice sure of\r\nall is the most nauseous. There is hardly a folly more absurd, or which\r\nseems less to be accounted for (though it is what we see every day) than\r\nthat grave and honest natures give into this way, and at the same time\r\nhave good sense, if they thought fit to use it: but the fatality (under\r\nwhich most men labour) of desiring to be what they are not, makes them\r\ngo out of a method, in which they might be received with applause, and\r\nwould certainly excel, into one, wherein they will all their life have\r\nthe air of strangers to what they aim at. For this reason, I have not\r\nlamented the metamorphosis of any one I know so much as of Nobilis, who\r\nwas born with sweetness of temper, just apprehension, and everything\r\nelse that might make him a man fit for his order. But instead of the\r\npursuit of sober studies and applications, in which he would certainly\r\nbe capable of making a considerable figure in the noblest assembly of\r\nmen in the world; I say, in spite of that good nature, which is his\r\nproper bent, he will say ill-natured things aloud, put such as he was,\r\nand still should be, out of countenance, and drown all the natural good\r\nin him, to receive an artificial ill character, in which he will never\r\nsucceed: for Nobilis is no rake. He may guzzle as much wine as he\r\npleases, talk bawdy if he thinks fit; but he may as well drink\r\nwater-gruel, and go twice a day to church, for it will never do. I\r\npronounce it again, Nobilis is no rake. To be of that order, he must be\r\nvicious against his will, and not so by study or application. All Pretty\r\nFellows are also excluded to a man, as well as all Inamaratos, or\r\npersons of the epicene gender, who gaze at one another in the presence\r\nof ladies. This class, of which I am giving you an account, is pretended\r\nto also by men of strong abilities in drinking; though they are such\r\nwhom the liquor, not the conversation, keeps together. But blockheads\r\nmay roar, fight, and stab, and be never the nearer; their labour is also\r\nlost; they want sense: they are no rakes.\r\n\r\nAs a rake among men is the man who lives in the constant abuse of his\r\nreason, so a coquette among women is one who lives in continual\r\nmisapplication of her beauty. The chief of all whom I have the honour to\r\nbe acquainted with, is pretty Mrs. Toss: she is ever in practice of\r\nsomething which disfigures her, and takes from her charms; though all\r\nshe does, tends to a contrary effect. She has naturally a very agreeable\r\nvoice and utterance, which she has changed for the prettiest lisp\r\nimaginable. She sees what she has a mind to see, at half a mile distance;\r\nbut poring with her eyes half shut at every one she passes by, she\r\nbelieves much more becoming. The Cupid on her fan and she have their eyes\r\nfull on each other, all the time in which they are not both in motion.\r\nWhenever her eye is turned from that dear object, you may have a glance,\r\nand your bow, if she is in humour, returned as civilly as you make it;\r\nbut that must not be in the presence of a man of greater quality: for\r\nMrs. Toss is so thoroughly well bred, that the chief person present has\r\nall her regards. And she, who giggles at divine service, and laughs at\r\nher very mother, can compose herself at the approach of a man of a good\r\nestate.\r\n\r\n\r\nWill's Coffee-house, June 9.\r\n\r\nA fine lady showed a gentleman of this company, for an eternal answer to\r\nall his addresses, a paper of verses, with which she is so captivated,\r\nthat she professed, the author should be the happy man in spite of all\r\nother pretenders. It is ordinary for love to make men poetical, and it\r\nhad that effect on this enamoured man: but he was resolved to try his\r\nvein upon some of her confidantes or retinue, before he ventured upon so\r\nhigh a theme as herself. To do otherwise than so, would be like making\r\nan heroic poem a man's first attempt. Among the favourites to the fair\r\none, he found her parrot not to be in the last degree: he saw Poll had\r\nher ear, when his sighs were neglected. To write against him, had been a\r\nfruitless labour; therefore he resolved to flatter him into his\r\ninterests, in the following manner:\r\n\r\n#\"To a Lady on her Parrot.#\r\n\r\n    _\"When nymphs were coy, and love could not prevail,\r\n    The gods disguised were seldom known to fail,\r\n    Leda was chaste, but yet a feathered Jove\r\n    Surprised the fair, and taught her how to love.\r\n    There's no celestial but his heaven would quit,\r\n    For any form which might to thee admit.\r\n    See how the wanton bird, at every glance,\r\n    Swells his glad plumes, and feels an amorous trance.\r\n    The queen of beauty has forsook the dove,\r\n    Henceforth the parrot be the bird of love.\"_\r\n\r\nIt is indeed a very just proposition, to give that honour rather to the\r\nparrot than the other volatile. The parrot represents us in the state of\r\nmaking love: the dove in the possession of the object beloved. But\r\ninstead of turning the dove off, I fancy it would be better if the\r\nchaise of Venus had hereafter a parrot added (as we see sometimes a\r\nthird horse to a coach) which might intimate, that to be a parrot, is\r\nthe only way to succeed; and to be a dove, to preserve your conquests.\r\nIf the swain would go on successfully, he must imitate the bird he\r\nwrites upon. For he who would be loved by women, must never be silent\r\nbefore the favour, or open his lips after it.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom my own Apartment, June 10.\r\n\r\nI have so many messages from young gentlemen who expect preferment and\r\ndistinction, that I am wholly at a loss in what manner to acquit myself.\r\nThe writer of the following letter tells me in a postscript, he cannot\r\ngo out of town till I have taken some notice of him, and is very urgent\r\nto be somebody, in town before he leaves it, and returns to his commons\r\nat the university. But take it from himself.\r\n\r\n#\"_To Isaac Bickerstaff, Esq., Monitor-General of Great Britain._#\r\n\r\n\"Shire Lane, _June 8._\r\n\r\nI have been above six months from the university, of age these three\r\nmonths, and so long in town. I was recommended to one Charles\r\nBubbleboy[291] near the Temple, who has supplied me with all the\r\nfurniture he says a gentleman ought to have. I desired a certificate\r\nthereof from him, which he said would require some time to consider of;\r\nand when I went yesterday morning for it, he tells me, upon due\r\nconsideration, I still want some few odd things more, to the value of\r\nthreescore or fourscore pounds, to make me complete. I have bespoke\r\nthem; and the favour I beg of you is, to know, when I am equipped, in\r\nwhat part or class of men in this town you will place me.

I cannot see either his person or\r\nhabit in this letter; but I'll call at Charles', and know the shape of\r\nhis snuff-box, by which I can settle his character. Though indeed, to\r\nknow his full capacity, I ought to be informed, whether he takes Spanish\r\nor musty.[292]\r\n\r\n\r\nSt. James's Coffee-house, June 10.\r\n\r\nLetters from the Low Countries of the 17th instant say, that the Duke of\r\nMarlborough and the Prince of Savoy intended to leave Ghent on that day,\r\nand join the army, which lies between Pont d'Espiere and Courtray, their\r\nheadquarters being at Helchin. The same day the Palatine foot was\r\nexpected at Brussels. Lieutenant-General Dompre, with a body of eight\r\nthousand men, is posted at Alost, in order to cover Ghent and Brussels.\r\nThe Marshal de Villars was still on the plains of Lens; and it is said,\r\nthe Duke of Vendôme is appointed to command in conjunction with that\r\ngeneral. Advices from Paris say, Monsieur Voisin is made Secretary of\r\nState, upon Monsieur Chamillard's resignation of that employment. The\r\nwant of money in that kingdom is so great, that the Court has thought\r\nfit to command all the plate of private families to be brought into the\r\nMint. They write from the Hague of the 18th, that the States of Holland\r\ncontinue their session; and that they have approved the resolution of\r\nthe States-General, to publish a second edict to prohibit the sale of\r\ncorn to the enemy. Many eminent persons in that assembly have declared,\r\nthat they are of opinion, that all commerce whatsoever with France\r\nshould be wholly forbidden: which point is under present deliberation;\r\nbut it is feared it will meet with powerful opposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 289: No. 21.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 290: People of fashion dined at about four o'clock in Queen\r\nAnne's time, and by six the men, who had often drunk a good deal of\r\nwine, would be finding their way to the clubs and coffee-houses.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 291: Charles Mather, a toyman in Fleet Street, next door to\r\nNandoe's Coffee-house, over against Chancery Lane.

A youth entering a\r\ncertain coffee-house, with his cane tied at his button, wearing\r\nred-heeled shoes, I thought of your description,[293] and could not\r\nforbear telling a friend of mine next to me, 'There enters a smart\r\nfellow.' The gentleman hearing it, had immediately a mind to pick a\r\nquarrel with me, and desired satisfaction: at which I was more puzzled\r\nthan at the other, remembering what mention your familiar makes of those\r\nthat had lost their lives on such occasions. The thing is referred to\r\nyour judgment, and I expect you to be my second, since you have been the\r\ncause of our quarrel. I am,\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\r\n\r\n\"Your Friend and humble Servant.\"\r\n\r\nI absolutely pronounce, that there is no occasion of offence given in\r\nthis expression; for a \"smart fellow\" is always an appellation of\r\npraise, and is a man of double capacity. The true cast or mould in which\r\nyou may be sure to know him is, when his livelihood or education is in\r\nthe Civil List, and you see him express a vivacity or mettle above the\r\nway he is in by a little jerk in his motion, short trip in his steps,\r\nwell-fancied lining of his coat, or any other indications which may be\r\ngiven in a vigorous dress. Now, what possible insinuation can there be,\r\nthat it is a cause of quarrel for a man to say, he allows a gentleman\r\nreally to be, what he, his tailor, his hosier, and his milliner, have\r\nconspired to make him? I confess, if this person who appeals to me had\r\nsaid, he was _not_ a \"smart fellow,\" there had been cause for\r\nresentment; but if he stands to it that he is one, he leaves no manner\r\nof ground for a misunderstanding. Indeed, it is a most lamentable thing,\r\nthat there should be a dispute raised upon a man's saying another is,\r\nwhat he plainly takes pains to be thought. But this point cannot be so\r\nwell adjusted, as by inquiring what are the sentiments of wise nations\r\nand communities of the use of the sword, and from thence conclude,\r\nwhether it is honourable to draw it so frequently or not? An illustrious\r\ncommonwealth of Italy[294] has preserved itself for many ages, without\r\nletting one of their subjects handle this destructive instrument, always\r\nleaving that work to such of mankind as understand the use of a whole\r\nskin so little, as to make a profession of exposing it to cuts and\r\nscars. But what need we run to such foreign instances: our own ancient\r\nand well-governed cities are conspicuous examples to all mankind in\r\ntheir regulation of military achievements. The chief citizens, like the\r\nnoble Italians, hire mercenaries to carry arms in their stead; and you\r\nshall have a fellow of a desperate fortune, for the gain of one\r\nhalf-crown, go through all the dangers of Tothill Fields, or the\r\nArtillery Ground,[295] clap his right jaw within two inches of the\r\ntouch-hole of a musket, fire it off, and huzza, with as little concern\r\nas he tears a pullet. Thus you see to what scorn of danger these\r\nmercenaries arrive, out of a mere love of sordid gain: but methinks it\r\nshould take off the strong prepossession men have in favour of bold\r\nactions, when they see upon what low motives men aspire to them. Do but\r\nobserve the common practice in the government of those heroic bodies,\r\nour militia and lieutenancies, the most ancient corps of soldiers,\r\nperhaps, in the universe. I question whether there is one instance of an\r\nanimosity between any two of these illustrious sons of Mars since their\r\ninstitution, which was decided by combat? I remember indeed to have read\r\nthe chronicle of an accident which had like to have occasioned bloodshed\r\nin the very field before all the general officers, though most of them\r\nwere justices of the peace: Captain Crabtree of Birching Lane,\r\nhaberdasher, had drawn a bill upon Major-General Maggot, cheesemonger in\r\nThames Street. Crabtree draws this upon Mr. William Maggot and Company.\r\nA country lad received this bill, and not understanding the word\r\n\"company,\" used in drawing bills on men in partnership, carried it to\r\nMr. Jeffry Stick of Crooked Lane (lieutenant of the major-general's\r\ncompany) whom he had the day before seen march by the door in all the\r\npomp of his commission. The lieutenant accepts it, for the honour of the\r\ncompany, since it had come to him. But repayment being asked from the\r\nmajor-general, he absolutely refuses. Upon this, the lieutenant thinks\r\nof nothing less than to bring this to a rupture, and takes for his\r\nsecond, Tobias Armstrong of the Counter,[296] and sends him with a\r\nchallenge in a script of parchment, wherein was written, \"Stitch contra\r\nMaggot,\" and all the fury vanished in a moment. The major-general gives\r\nsatisfaction to the second, and all was well. Hence it is, that the bold\r\nspirits of our city are kept in such subjection to the civil power.\r\nOtherwise, where would our liberties soon be? If wealth and valour were\r\nsuffered to exert themselves with their utmost force: if such officers\r\nas are employed in the terrible bands above-mentioned, were to draw\r\nbills as well as swords: these dangerous captains, who could victual an\r\narmy as well as lead it, would be too powerful for the State. But the\r\npoint of honour justly gives way to that of gain; and by long and wise\r\nregulation, the richest is the bravest man. I have known a captain rise\r\nto a colonel in two days by the fall of stocks; and a major, my good\r\nfriend, near the Monument, ascended to that honour by the fall of the\r\nprice of spirits, and the rising of right Nantz. By this true sense of\r\nhonour, that body of warriors are ever in good order and discipline,\r\nwith their colours and coats all whole: as in other battalions (where\r\ntheir principles of action are less solid) you see the men of service\r\nlook like spectres, with long sides, and lank cheeks. In this army, you\r\nmay measure a man's services by his waist, and the most prominent belly\r\nis certainly the man who has been most upon action. Besides all this,\r\nthere is another excellent remark to be made in the discipline of these\r\ntroops. It being of absolute necessity that the people of England should\r\nsee what they have for their money, and be eye-witnesses of the\r\nadvantages they gain by it, all battles which are fought abroad are\r\nrepresented here. But since one side must be beaten, and the other\r\nconquer, which might create disputes, the eldest company is always to\r\nmake the other run, and the younger retreats, according to the last news\r\nand best intelligence. I have myself seen Prince Eugene make Catinat fly\r\nfrom the back-side of Gray's Inn Lane to Hockley-in-the-Hole,[297] and\r\nnot give over the pursuit, till obliged to leave the Bear Garden on the\r\nright, to avoid being borne down by fencers, wild bulls and monsters,\r\ntoo terrible for the encounter of any heroes, but such whose lives are\r\ntheir livelihood.\r\n\r\nWe have here seen, that wise nations do not admit of fighting, even in\r\nthe defence of their country, as a laudable action; and they live\r\nwithin the walls of our own city in great honour and reputation without\r\nit. It would be very necessary to understand, by what force of the\r\nclimate, food, education, or employment, one man's sense is brought to\r\ndiffer so essentially from that of another; that one is ridiculous and\r\ncontemptible for forbearing a thing which makes for his safety; and\r\nanother applauded for consulting his ruin and destruction.\r\n\r\nIt will therefore be necessary for us (to show our travelling) to\r\nexamine this subject fully, and tell you how it comes to pass, that a\r\nman of honour in Spain, though you offend him never so gallantly, stabs\r\nyou basely; in England, though you offend never so basely, challenges\r\nfairly: the former kills you out of revenge; the latter out of good\r\nbreeding. But to probe the heart of a man in this particular to its\r\nutmost thoughts and recesses, I must wait for the return of Pacolet, who\r\nis now attending a gentleman lately in a duel, and sometimes visits the\r\nperson by whose hand he received his wounds.\r\n\r\n\r\nSt. James's Coffee-house, June 13.\r\n\r\nLetters from Vienna of the 8th instant say, there has been a journal of\r\nthe marches and actions of the King of Sweden, from the beginning of\r\nJanuary to the 11th of April, N.S., communicated by the Swedish\r\nMinisters to that Court. These advices inform, that his Swedish Majesty\r\nentered the territories of Muscovy in February last with the main body\r\nof his army, in order to oblige the enemy to a general engagement; but\r\nthat the Muscovites declining a battle, and a universal thaw having\r\nrendered the rivers unpassable, the king returned into Ukrania. There\r\nare mentioned several rencounters between considerable detachments of\r\nthe Swedish and Russian armies. Marshal Heister intended to take his\r\nleave of the Court on the day after the date of these letters, and put\r\nhimself at the head of the army in Hungary. The malcontents had\r\nattempted to send in a supply of provisions into Neuheusel; but their\r\ndesign was disappointed by the Germans.\r\n\r\nAdvices from Berlin of the 15th instant, N.S., say, that his Danish\r\nMajesty having received an invitation from the King of Prussia to an\r\ninterview, designed to come to Potsdam within few days; and that King\r\nAugustus resolved to accompany him thither. To avoid all difficulties in\r\nceremony, the three kings, and all the company who shall have the honour\r\nto sit with them at table, are to draw lots, and take precedence\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\nThey write from Hamburg of the 18th instant, N.S., that some particular\r\nletters from Dantzic speak of a late action between the Swedes and\r\nMuscovites near Jaroslaw; but that engagement being mentioned from no\r\nother place, there is not much credit given to this intelligence.\r\n\r\nWe hear from Brussels, by letters, dated the 20th, that on the 14th in\r\nthe evening the Duke of Marlborough and Prince Eugene arrived at\r\nCourtray, with a design to proceed the day following to Lille, in the\r\nneighbourhood of which city the confederate army was to rendezvous the\r\nsame day. Advices from Paris inform us, that the Marshal de Bezons is\r\nappointed to command in Dauphiné; and that the Duke of Berwick is set\r\nout for Spain, with a design to follow the fortunes of the Duke of\r\nAnjou, in case the French king should comply with the late demands of\r\nthe Allies.\r\n\r\nThe Court of France has sent a circular letter to all the governors of\r\nthe provinces, to recommend to their consideration his Majesty's late\r\nconduct in the affair of peace. It is thought fit in that epistle, to\r\ncondescend to a certain appeal to the people, whether it is consistent\r\nwith the dignity of the crown, or the French name, to submit to the\r\npreliminaries demanded by the confederates? The letter dwells upon the\r\nunreasonableness of the Allies, in requiring, that his Majesty should\r\nassist in dethroning his grandson, and treats this particular in\r\nlanguage more suitable to it, as it is a topic of oratory, than a real\r\ncircumstance, on which the interests of nations, and reasons of State,\r\nwhich affect all Europe, are concerned.\r\n\r\nThe close of this memorial seems to prepare the people to expect all\r\nevents, attributing the confidence of the enemy to the goodness of their\r\ntroops; but acknowledging, that his sole dependence is upon the\r\nintervention of Providence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 293: See No. 26.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 294: Venice, where mercenaries were employed for fighting\r\npurposes.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 295: The City train-bands were often the subject of ridicule\r\nby the wits.

In the \"Beggar's Opera,\" Mrs. Peachum says: \"You\r\nshould to Hockley-in-the-Hole and to Marybone, child, to learn valour;\r\nthere are the schools that have bred so many brave men.\" As to the other\r\nsports at the Bear Garden, see No. 134, and Gay's \"Trivia,\" ii. 407-12:\r\n\r\n    \"When thro' the town, with slow and solemn air,\r\n    Led by the nostril, walks the muzzled bear;\r\n    Behind him moves, majestically dull,\r\n    The pride of Hockley-hole, the surly bull;\r\n    Learn hence the periods of the week to name:\r\n    Mondays and Thursdays are the days of game.\"\r\n\r\nThere were seats, at half a crown and upwards, for the quality; the\r\nneighbourhood of the Bear Garden was infested by thieves.

To\r\none of my letters on this subject, I have received the following\r\nanswer:[298]\r\n\r\n\"SIR,\r\n\r\n\"In answer to your question, why men of sense, virtue, and experience,\r\nare seen still to comply with that ridiculous custom of duelling, I must\r\ndesire you to reflect, that custom has dished up in ruffs the wisest\r\nheads of our ancestors, and put the best of the present age into huge\r\nfalbala periwigs.[299] Men of sense would not impose such encumbrances\r\non themselves; but be glad they might show their faces decently in\r\npublic upon easier terms. If then such men appear reasonably slaves to\r\nthe fashion, in what regards the figure of their persons, we ought not\r\nto wonder, that they are at least so in what seems to touch their\r\nreputations. Besides, you can't be ignorant, that dress and chivalry\r\nhave been always encouraged by the ladies, as the two principal branches\r\nof gallantry. It is to avoid being sneered at for his singularity, and\r\nfrom a desire to appear more agreeable to his mistress, that a wise,\r\nexperienced, and polite man, complies with the dress commonly received,\r\nand is prevailed upon to violate his reason and principles, in hazarding\r\nhis life and estate by a tilt, as well as suffering his pleasures to be\r\nconstrained and soured by the constant apprehension of a quarrel. This\r\nis the more surprising, because men of the most delicate sense and\r\nprinciples have naturally in other cases a particular repugnance in\r\naccommodating themselves to the maxims of the world: but one may easily\r\ndistinguish the man that is affected with beauty, and the reputation of\r\na tilt, from him who complies with both, merely as they are imposed upon\r\nhim by custom; for in the former you will remark an air of vanity and\r\ntriumph; whereas when the latter appears in a long Duvillier full of\r\npowder, or has decided a quarrel by the sword, you may perceive in his\r\nface, that he appeals to custom for an excuse. I think it may not be\r\nimproper to inquire into the genealogy of this chimerical monster,\r\ncalled a 'duel', which I take to be an illegitimate species of the\r\nancient knight-errantry. By the laws of this whim, your heroic person,\r\nor man of gallantry, was indispensably obliged to starve in armour a\r\ncertain number of years in the chase of monsters, encounter them at the\r\nperil of his life, and suffer great hardships, in order to gain the\r\naffection of the fair lady, and qualify himself for assuming the\r\n_belair_, that is, of a pretty fellow, or man of honour according to the\r\nfashion: but since the publishing of 'Don Quixote' and extinction of the\r\nrace of dragons, which Suetonius says happened in that of Wantley,[300]\r\nthe gallant and heroic spirits of these latter times have been under the\r\nnecessity of creating new chimerical monsters to entertain themselves\r\nwith, by way of single combats, as the only proofs they are able to give\r\ntheir own sex, and the ladies, that they are in all points men of nice\r\nhonour. But to do justice to the ancient and real monsters, I must\r\nobserve, that they never molested those who were not of a humour to hunt\r\nfor them in the woods and deserts; whereas on the contrary, our modern\r\nmonsters are so familiarly admitted and entertained in all the Courts\r\nand cities of Europe (except France) that one can scarce be in the most\r\nhumanised society without risking one's life; the people of the best\r\nsort, and the fine gentlemen of the age, being so fond of them, that\r\nthey seldom appear in any public place without one. I have some further\r\nconsiderations upon this subject, which, as you encourage me, shall be\r\ncommunicated to you, by, sir, a cousin but once removed from the best\r\nfamily of the Staffs, namely, \"Sir,\r\n\r\n\"Your humble Servant,\r\n\r\n\"Kinsman and Friend,\r\n\r\n                                        \"TIM SWITCH.\"\r\n\r\nIt is certain, Mr. Switch has hit upon the true source of this evil; and\r\nthat it proceeds only from the force of custom that we contradict\r\nourselves in half the particulars and occurrences of life. But such a\r\ntyranny in love, which the fair impose upon us, is a little too severe,\r\nthat we must demonstrate our affection for them by no certain proof but\r\nhatred to one another, or come at them (only as one does to an estate)\r\nby survivorship. This way of application to gain a lady's heart, is\r\ntaking her as we do towns and castles, by distressing the place, and\r\nletting none come near them without our pass. Were such a lover once to\r\nwrite the truth of his heart, and let her know his whole thoughts, he\r\nwould appear indeed to have a passion for her; but it would hardly be\r\ncalled love. The billet-doux would run to this purpose:\r\n\r\n\"MADAM,\r\n\r\n\"I have so tender a regard for you and your interests, that I'll knock\r\nany man in the head whom I observe to be of my mind, and like you. Mr.\r\nTruman the other day looked at you in so languishing a manner, that I am\r\nresolved to run him through to-morrow morning: this, I think, he\r\ndeserves for his guilt in admiring you; than which I cannot have a\r\ngreater reason for murdering him, except it be that you also approve\r\nhim. Whoever says he dies for you, I will make his words good, for I\r\nwill kill him. I am,\r\n\r\n\"Madam,\r\n\r\n\"Your most obedient,\r\n\r\n\"Most humble Servant.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom my own Apartment, June 14.\r\n\r\nI am just come hither at ten at night, and have ever since six been in\r\nthe most celebrated, though most nauseous, company in town: the two\r\nleaders of the society were a critic and a wit. These two gentlemen are\r\ngreat opponents upon all occasions, not discerning that they are the\r\nnearest each other in temper and talents of any two classes of men in\r\nthe world; for to profess judgment, and to profess wit, both arise from\r\nthe same failure, which is want of judgment. The poverty of the critic\r\nthis way proceeds from the abuse of his faculty; that of the wit from\r\nthe neglect of it. It is a particular observation I have always made,\r\nthat of all mortals, a critic is the silliest; for by inuring himself\r\nto examine all things, whether they are of consequence or not, be never\r\nlooks upon anything but with a design of passing sentence upon it; by\r\nwhich means, he is never a companion, but always a censor. This makes\r\nhim earnest upon trifles; and dispute on the most indifferent occasions\r\nwith vehemence. If he offers to speak or write, that talent which should\r\napprove the work of the other faculties, prevents their operation. He\r\ncomes upon action in armour; but without weapons: he stands in safety;\r\nbut can gain no glory. The wit on the other hand has been hurried so\r\nlong away by imagination only, that judgment seems not to have ever been\r\none of his natural faculties. This gentleman takes himself to be as much\r\nobliged to be merry, as the other to be grave. A thorough critic is a\r\nsort of Puritan in the polite world. As an enthusiast in religion\r\nstumbles at the ordinary occurrences of life, if he cannot quote\r\nscripture examples on the occasion; so the critic is never safe in his\r\nspeech or writing, without he has among the celebrated writers an\r\nauthority for the truth of his sentence. You will believe we had a very\r\ngood time with these brethren, who were so far out of the dress of their\r\nnative country, and so lost to its dialect, that they were as much\r\nstrangers to themselves, as to their relation to each other. They took\r\nup the whole discourse; sometimes the critic grew passionate, and when\r\nreprimanded by the wit for any trip or hesitation in his voice, he would\r\nanswer, Mr. Dryden makes such a character on such an occasion break off\r\nin the same manner; so that the stop was according to nature, and as a\r\nman in a passion should do. The wit, who is as far gone in letters as\r\nhimself, seems to be at a loss to answer such an apology; and concludes\r\nonly, that though his anger is justly vented, it wants fire in the\r\nutterance. If wit is to be measured by the circumstances of time and\r\nplace, there is no man has generally so little of that talent, as he who\r\nis a wit by profession. What he says, instead of arising from the\r\noccasion, has an occasion invented to bring it in. Thus he is new for no\r\nother reason, but that he talks like nobody else; but has taken up a\r\nmethod of his own, without commerce of dialogue with other people. The\r\nlively Jasper Dactyle[301] is one of this character. He seems to have\r\nmade a vow to be witty to his life's end. When you meet him, \"What do\r\nyou think,\" says he, \"I have been entertaining myself with?\" Then out\r\ncomes a premeditated turn, to which it is to no purpose to answer; for\r\nhe goes on in the same strain of thought he designed without your\r\nspeaking. Therefore I have a general answer to all he can say; as, \"Sure\r\nthere never was any creature had so much fire!\" Spondee, who is a\r\ncritic, is seldom out of this fine man's company. They have no manner of\r\naffection for each other, but keep together, like Novel and Oldfox in\r\n\"The Plain Dealer,\"[302] because they show each other. I know several of\r\nsense who can be diverted with this couple; but I see no curiosity in\r\nthe thing, except it be, that Spondee is dull, and seems dull; but\r\nDactyle is heavy with a brisk face. It must be owned also, that Dactyle\r\nhas almost vigour enough to be a coxcomb; but Spondee, by the lowness of\r\nhis constitution, is only a blockhead.\r\n\r\n\r\nSt. James's Coffee-house, June 15.\r\n\r\nWe have no particulars of moment since our last, except it be, that the\r\ncopy of the following original letter came by the way of Ostend. It is\r\nsaid to have been found in the closet of Monsieur Chamillard, the late\r\nSecretary of State of France, since his disgrace. It was signed by two\r\nbrothers of the famous Cavallier,[303] who led the Cevennois, and had a\r\npersonal interview with the king, as well as a capitulation to lay down\r\nhis arms, and leave the dominions of France. There are many other names\r\nto it; among whom, is the chief of the family of the Marquis\r\nGuiscard.[304] It is not yet known, whether Monsieur Chamillard had any\r\nreal design to favour the Protestant interest, or only thought to place\r\nhimself at the head of that people, to make himself considerable enough\r\nto oppose his enemies at Court, and reinstate himself in power there.\r\n\r\n\"SIR,\r\n\r\n\"We have read your Majesty's[305] letter to the governors of your\r\nprovinces, with instructions what sentiments to insinuate into the minds\r\nof your people: but as you have always acted upon the maxim, that we\r\nwere made for you, and not you for us, we must take leave to assure your\r\nMajesty, that we are exactly of the contrary opinion, and must desire\r\nyou to send for your grandson home, and acquaint him, that you now know\r\nby experience, absolute power is only a vertigo in the brain of princes,\r\nwhich for a time may quicken their motion, and double in their diseased\r\nsight the instances of power above them; but must end in their fall and\r\ndestruction. Your memorial speaks a good father of your family, but a\r\nvery ill one of your people. Your Majesty is reduced to hear truth when\r\nyou are obliged to speak it: there is no governing any but savages by\r\nany methods but their own consent, which you seem to acknowledge, in\r\nappealing to us for our opinion of your conduct in treating of peace.\r\nHad your people been always of your council, the King of France had\r\nnever been reduced so low, as to acknowledge his arms were fallen into\r\ncontempt. But since it is thus, we must ask, 'How is any man of France,\r\nbut they of the House of Bourbon, the better that Philip is King of\r\nSpain?' We have outgrown that folly of placing our happiness in your\r\nMajesty's being called, The Great; therefore as you and we are all alike\r\nbankrupts,[306] and undone, let us not deceive ourselves, but compound\r\nwith our adversaries, and not talk like their equals. Your Majesty must\r\nforgive us that we cannot wish you success, or lend you help; for if you\r\nlose one battle more, we may have a hand in the peace you make; and\r\ndoubt not but your Majesty's faith in treaties will require the\r\nratification of the states of your kingdoms. So we bid you heartily\r\nfarewell, till we have the honour to meet you assembled in Parliament.\r\nThis happy expectation makes us willing to wait the event of another\r\ncampaign, from whence we hope to be raised from the misery of slaves, to\r\nthe privileges of subjects.

It was in the heat of this gallant struggle to\r\npreserve themselves from religious slavery, that the first seeds of that\r\nwild fanaticism were sown, which afterwards grew up to such an amazing\r\nextravagance, and distinguished them, by the name of French Prophets,\r\namong the most extraordinary enthusiasts that are to be found in the\r\nhistory of human folly. Cavallier, who found in his latter days an\r\nhospitable asylum in Ireland, published, in 1726, \"Memoirs of the Wars\r\nof the Cevennes, under Col.

However, I must go on\r\ncheerfully in my work of reformation: that being my great design, I am\r\nstudious to prevent my labours increasing upon me; therefore am\r\nparticularly observant of the temper and inclinations of childhood and\r\nyouth, that we may not give vice and folly supplies from the growing\r\ngeneration. It is hardly to be imagined how useful this study is, and\r\nwhat great evils or benefits arise from putting us in our tender years\r\nto what we are fit, or unfit: therefore on Tuesday last (with a design\r\nto sound their inclinations) I took three lads who are under my\r\nguardianship a rambling, in a hackney-coach, to show them the town, as\r\nthe lions,[307] the tombs,[308] Bedlam,[309] and the other places which\r\nare entertainments to raw minds, because they strike forcibly on the\r\nfancy. The boys are brothers, one of sixteen, the other of fourteen, the\r\nother of twelve. The first was his father's darling, the second his\r\nmother's, and the third is mine, who am their uncle. Mr. William is a\r\nlad of true genius; but being at the upper end of a great school, and\r\nhaving all the lads below him, his arrogance is insupportable. If I\r\nbegin to show a little of my Latin, he immediately interrupts: \"Uncle,\r\nunder favour, that which you say is not understood in that manner.\"\r\n\"Brother,\" says my boy Jack, \"you do not show your manners much in\r\ncontradicting my Uncle Isaac.\" \"You queer cur,\" says Mr. William, \"do\r\nyou think my uncle takes any notice of such a dull rogue as you are?\"\r\nMr. William goes on; \"He is the most stupid of all my mother's children:\r\nhe knows nothing of his book: when he should mind that, he is hiding or\r\nhoarding his taws and marbles, or laying up farthings. His way of\r\nthinking is, four and twenty farthings make sixpence, and two sixpences\r\na shilling, two shillings and sixpence half a crown, and two half-crowns\r\nfive shillings. So within these two months, the close hunks has scraped\r\nup twenty shillings, and we'll make him spend it all before he comes\r\nhome.\" Jack immediately claps his hands into both pockets, and turns as\r\npale as ashes. There is nothing touches a parent (and such I am to Jack)\r\nso nearly, as a provident temper. This lad has in him the true temper\r\nfor a good husband, a kind father, and an honest executor. All the great\r\npeople you see make considerable figures on the 'Change, in Court, and\r\nsometimes in Senates, are such as in reality have no greater faculty\r\nthan what may be called human instinct, which is a natural tendency to\r\ntheir own preservation, and that of their friends, without being capable\r\nof striking out of the road for adventures. There is Sir William Scrip\r\nwas of this sort of capacity from his childhood: he has bought the\r\ncountry round him, and makes a bargain better than Sir Harry Wildfire\r\nwith all his wit and humour. Sir Harry never wants money but he comes to\r\nScrip, laughs at him half an hour, and then gives bond for the other\r\nthousand. The close men are incapable of placing merit anywhere but in\r\ntheir pence, and therefore gain it; while others, who have larger\r\ncapacities, are diverted from the pursuit by enjoyments, which can be\r\nsupported only by that cash which they despise; and therefore are in the\r\nend, slaves to their inferiors both in fortune and understanding. I once\r\nheard a man of excellent sense observe, that more affairs in the world\r\nfailed by being in the hands of men of too large capacities for their\r\nbusiness, than by being in the conduct of such as wanted abilities to\r\nexecute them. Jack therefore being of a plodding make, shall be a\r\ncitizen; and I design him to be the refuge of the family in their\r\ndistress, as well as their jest in prosperity. His brother Will, shall\r\ngo to Oxford with all speed, where, if he does not arrive at being a man\r\nof sense, he will soon be informed wherein he is a coxcomb. There is in\r\nthat place such a true spirit of raillery and humour, that if they can't\r\nmake you a wise man, they will certainly let you know you are a fool,\r\nwhich is all my cousin wants to cease to be so. Thus having taken these\r\ntwo out of the way, I have leisure to look at my third lad. I observe in\r\nthe young rogue a natural subtilty of mind, which discovers itself\r\nrather in forbearing to declare his thoughts on any occasion, than in\r\nany visible way of exerting himself in discourse. For which reason I\r\nwill place him where, if he commits no faults, he may go farther than\r\nthose in other stations, though they excel in virtues. The boy is well\r\nfashioned, and will easily fall into a graceful manner; wherefore, I\r\nhave a design to make him a page to a great lady of my acquaintance; by\r\nwhich means he will be well skilled in the common modes of life, and\r\nmake a greater progress in the world by that knowledge, than with the\r\ngreatest qualities without it. A good mien in a Court will carry a man\r\ngreater lengths than a good understanding in any other place. We see a\r\nworld of pains taken, and the best years of life spent, in collecting a\r\nset of thoughts in a college for the conduct of life; and after all, the\r\nman so qualified shall hesitate in his speech to a good suit of clothes,\r\nand want common sense before an agreeable woman. Hence it is, that\r\nwisdom, valour, justice, and learning, can't keep a man in countenance\r\nthat is possessed with these excellences, if he wants that less art of\r\nlife and behaviour, called \"good breeding.\" A man endowed with great\r\nperfections without this, is like one who has his pockets full of gold,\r\nbut always wants change for his ordinary occasions. Will. Courtly is a\r\nliving instance of this truth, and has had the same education which I am\r\ngiving my nephew. He never spoke a thing but what was said before; and\r\nyet can converse with the wittiest men without being ridiculous. Among\r\nthe learned, he does not appear ignorant; nor with the wise, indiscreet.\r\nLiving in conversation from his infancy, makes him nowhere at a loss;\r\nand a long familiarity with the persons of men, is in a manner of the\r\nsame service to him, as if he knew their arts. As ceremony is the\r\ninvention of wise men to keep fools at a distance, so good breeding is\r\nan expedient to make fools and wise men equals.\r\n\r\n\r\nWill's Coffee-house, June 17.\r\n\r\nThe suspension of the playhouse[310] has made me have nothing to send\r\nyou from hence; but calling here this evening, I found the party I\r\nusually sit with, upon the business of writing, and examining what was\r\nthe handsomest style in which to address women, and write letters of\r\ngallantry. Many were the opinions which were immediately declared on\r\nthis subject: some were for a certain softness; some for I know not what\r\ndelicacy; others for something inexpressibly tender: when it came to me,\r\nI said there was no rule in the world to be made for writing letters,\r\nbut that of being as near what you speak face to face as you can; which\r\nis so great a truth, that I am of opinion, writing has lost more\r\nmistresses than any one mistake in the whole legend of love. For when\r\nyou write to a lady for whom you have a solid and honourable love, the\r\ngreat idea you have of her, joined to a quick sense of her absence,\r\nfills your mind with a sort of tenderness, that gives your language too\r\nmuch the air of complaint, which is seldom successful. For a man may\r\nflatter himself as he pleases, but he will find, that the women have\r\nmore understanding in their own affairs than we have, and women of\r\nspirit are not to be won by mourners. Therefore he that can keep\r\nhandsomely within rules, and support the carriage of a companion to his\r\nmistress, is much more likely to prevail, than he who lets her see, the\r\nwhole relish of his life depends upon her. If possible therefore divert\r\nyour mistress, rather than sigh to her. The pleasant man she will desire\r\nfor her own sake; but the languishing lover has nothing to hope from but\r\nher pity. To show the difference I produced two letters a lady gave me,\r\nwhich had been writ to her by two gentlemen who pretended to her, but\r\nwere both killed the next day after the date at the battle of Almanza.\r\nOne of them was a mercurial gay-humoured man; the other a man of a\r\nserious, but a great and gallant spirit. Poor Jack Careless! This is his\r\nletter: you see how it is folded: the air of it is so negligent, one\r\nmight have read half of it by peeping into it, without breaking it open.\r\nHe had no exactness.\r\n\r\n\"MADAM,\r\n\r\n\"It is a very pleasant circumstance I am in, that while I should be\r\nthinking of the good company we are to meet within a day or two, where\r\nwe shall go to loggerheads, my thoughts are running upon a fair enemy in\r\nEngland. I was in hopes I had left you there; but you follow the camp,\r\nthough I have endeavoured to make some of our leaguer ladies drive you\r\nout of the field. All my comfort is, you are more troublesome to my\r\ncolonel than myself: I permit you to visit me only now and then; but he\r\ndownright keeps you. I laugh at his Honour as far as his gravity will\r\nallow me; but I know him to be a man of too much merit to succeed with a\r\nwoman. Therefore defend your heart as well as you can, I shall come home\r\nthis winter irresistibly dressed, and with quite a new foreign air. And\r\nso I had like to say, I rest, but alas! I remain,\r\n\r\n\"Madam,\r\n\r\n\"Your most obedient,\r\n\r\n\"Most humble Servant,\r\n\r\n                                        \"JOHN CARELESS.\"\r\n\r\nNow for Colonel Constant's epistle; you see it is folded and directed\r\nwith the utmost care.\r\n\r\n\"MADAM,\r\n\r\n\"I do myself the honour to write to you this evening, because I believe\r\nto-morrow will be a day of battle, and something forebodes in my breast\r\nthat I shall fall in it. If it proves so, I hope you will hear, I have\r\ndone nothing below a man who had a love of his country, quickened by a\r\npassion for a woman of honour. If there be anything noble in going to a\r\ncertain death; if there be any merit, that I meet it with pleasure, by\r\npromising myself a place in your esteem; if your applause, when I am no\r\nmore, is preferable to the most glorious life without you: I say, madam,\r\nif any of these considerations can have weight with you, you will give\r\nme a kind place in your memory, which I prefer to the glory of Cæsar. I\r\nhope, this will be read, as it is writ, with tears.\"\r\n\r\nThe beloved lady is a woman of a sensible mind; but she has confessed\r\nto me, that after all her true and solid value for Constant, she had\r\nmuch more concern for the loss of Careless. Those great and serious\r\nspirits have something equal to the adversities they meet with, and\r\nconsequently lessen the objects of pity. Great accidents seem not cut\r\nout so much for men of familiar characters, which makes them more easily\r\npitied, and soon after beloved. Add to this, that the sort of love which\r\ngenerally succeeds, is a stranger to awe and distance. I asked Romana,\r\nwhether of the two she should have chosen had they survived? She said,\r\nshe knew she ought to have taken Constant; but believed she should have\r\nchosen Careless.\r\n\r\n\r\nSt. James's Coffee-house, June 17.\r\n\r\nLetters from Lisbon of the 9th instant, N.S., say, that the enemy's\r\narmy, having blocked up Olivenza, was posted on the Guadiana. The\r\nPortuguese are very apprehensive that the garrison of that place, though\r\nit consists of five of the best regiments of their army, will be obliged\r\nto surrender, if not timely relieved, they not being supplied with\r\nprovisions for more than six weeks. Hereupon their generals held a\r\ncouncil of war on the 4th instant, wherein it was concluded to advance\r\ntowards Badajos. With this design the army decamped on the 5th from\r\nJerumena, and marched to Cancaon. It is hoped, that if the enemy follow\r\ntheir motions, they may have opportunity to put a sufficient quantity of\r\nprovision and ammunition into Olivenza.\r\n\r\nMr. Bickerstaff gives notice to all persons that dress themselves as\r\nthey please, without regard to decorum (as with blue and red stockings\r\nin mourning; tucked cravats, and nightcap wigs, before people of the\r\nfirst quality) that he has yet received no fine for indulging them in\r\nthat liberty, and that he expects their compliance with this demand, or\r\nthat they go home immediately and shift themselves. This is further to\r\nacquaint the town, that the report that the hosiers, toymen, and\r\nmilliners, have compounded with Mr. Bickerstaff for tolerating such\r\nenormities, is utterly false and scandalous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 307: At the Tower of London.

[STEELE.\r\n\r\nFrom _Saturday, June 18_, to _Tuesday, June 21, 1709._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nGrecian Coffee-house, June 18.\r\n\r\nIn my dissertation against the custom of single combat,[311] it has been\r\nobjected, that there is not learning, or much reading, shown therein,\r\nwhich is the very life and soul of all treatises; for which reason,\r\nbeing always easy to receive admonitions, and reform my errors, I\r\nthought fit to consult this learned board on the subject. Upon proposing\r\nsome doubts, and desiring their assistance, a very hopeful young\r\ngentleman, my relation, who is to be called to the bar within a year and\r\na half at farthest, told me, that he had ever since I first mentioned\r\nduelling turned his head that way; and that he was principally moved\r\nthereto, by reason that he thought to follow the circuits in the North\r\nof England and South of Scotland, and to reside mostly at his own estate\r\nat Landbadernawz[312] in Cardiganshire. The northern Britons and\r\nsouthern Scots are a warm people, and the Welsh a nation of gentlemen;\r\nso that it behoved him to understand well the science of quarrelling.\r\nThe young gentleman proceeded admirably well, and gave the board an\r\naccount, that he had read Fitzherbert's \"Grand Abridgment,\"[313] and had\r\nfound, that duelling is a very ancient part of the law: for when a man\r\nis sued, be it for his life or his land, the person that joins the\r\nissue, whether plaintiff or defendant, may put the trial upon the duel.\r\nFurther he argued, under favour of the court, that when the issue is\r\njoined by the duel in treason or other capital crimes, the parties\r\naccused and accuser must fight in their own proper persons: but if the\r\ndispute be for lands, you may hire a champion at\r\nHockley-in-the-Hole,[314] for anywhere else. This part of the law we had\r\nfrom the Saxons; and they had it, as also the trial by ordeal, from the\r\nLaplanders.[315] \"It is indeed agreed,\" said he, \"the Southern and\r\nEastern nations never knew anything of it; for though the ancient Romans\r\nwould scold, and call names filthily, yet there is not an example of a\r\nchallenge that ever passed amongst them.\" His quoting the Eastern\r\nnations, put another gentleman in mind of an account he had from a\r\nboatswain of an East Indiaman; which was, that a Chinese had tricked and\r\nbubbled him, and that when he came to demand satisfaction the next\r\nmorning, and like a true tar of honour called him \"Son of a whore,\"\r\n\"Liar,\" \"Dog,\" and other rough appellatives used by persons conversant\r\nwith winds and waves; the Chinese, with great tranquillity, desired him\r\nnot to come aboard fasting, nor put himself in a heat, for it would\r\nprejudice his health. Thus the East knows nothing of this gallantry.\r\nThere sat at the left of the table a person of a venerable aspect, who\r\nasserted, that half the impositions which are put upon these ages, have\r\nbeen transmitted by writers who have given too great pomp and\r\nmagnificence to the exploits of the ancient Bear Garden, and made their\r\ngladiators, by fabulous tradition, greater than Gorman[316] and others\r\nof Great Britain. He informed the company, that he had searched\r\nauthorities for what he said, and that a learned antiquary, Humphrey\r\nScarecrow, Esq., of Hockley-in-the-Hole, recorder to the Bear Garden,\r\nwas then writing a discourse on the subject. It appears by the best\r\naccounts, says this gentleman, that the high names which are used among\r\nus with so great veneration, were no other than stage-fighters, and\r\nworthies of the ancient Bear Garden. The renowned Hercules always\r\ncarried a quarterstaff, and was from thence called Claviger. A learned\r\nchronologist is about proving what wood this staff was made of, whether\r\noak, ash, or crab-tree. The first trial of skill he ever performed, was\r\nwith one Cacus, a deer-stealer; the next was with Typhonus, a giant of\r\nforty feet four inches. Indeed it was unhappily recorded, that meeting\r\nat last with a sailor's wife, she made his staff of prowess serve her\r\nown use, and dwindle away to a distaff: she clapped him on an old tar\r\njacket of her husband's; so that this great hero drooped like a scabbed\r\nsheep. Him his contemporary Theseus succeeded in the Bear Garden, which\r\nhonour he held for many years: this grand duellist went to hell, and was\r\nthe only one of that sort that ever came back again. As for Achilles and\r\nHector (as the ballads of those times mention), they were pretty smart\r\nfellows; they fought at sword and buckler; but the former had much the\r\nbetter of it; his mother, who was an oyster-woman, having got a\r\nblacksmith of Lemnos to make her son's weapons. There is a pair of\r\ntrusty Trojans in a song of Virgil's, that were famous for handling\r\ntheir gauntlets, Dares, and Entellus;[317] and indeed it does appear,\r\nthey fought [for] no sham prize. What arms the great Alexander used, is\r\nuncertain; however, the historian mentions, when he attacked Thalestris,\r\nit was only at single rapier; but the weapon soon failed; for it was\r\nalways observed, that the Amazons had a sort of enchantment about them,\r\nwhich made the blade of the weapon, though of never so good metal, at\r\nevery home push, lose its edge and grow feeble. The Roman Bear Garden\r\nwas abundantly more magnificent than anything Greece could boast of; it\r\nflourished most under those delights of mankind, Nero and Domitian: at\r\none time it is recorded, four hundred senators entered the list, and\r\nthought it an honour to be cudgelled and quarterstaffed.[318] I observe,\r\nthe Lanistaé were the people chiefly employed, which makes me imagine\r\nour Bear Garden copied much after this, the butchers being the greatest\r\nmen in it. Thus far the glory and honour of the Bear Garden stood\r\nsecure, till fate, that irresistible ruler of sublunary things, in that\r\nuniversal ruin of arts and politer learning, by those savage people the\r\nGoths and Vandals, destroyed and levelled it to the ground. Thus fell\r\nthe grandeur and bravery of the Roman state, till at last the warlike\r\ngenius (but accompanied with more courtesy) revived in the Christian\r\nworld under those puissant champions, St. George, St. Denis, and other\r\ndignified heroes: one killed his dragon, another his lion, and were all\r\nafterwards canonised for it, having red letters before them to\r\nillustrate their martial temper.[319] The Spanish nation, it must be\r\nowned, were devoted to gallantry and chivalry above the rest of the\r\nworld. What a great figure does that great name, Don Quixote, make in\r\nhistory? How shines this glorious star in the Western world? O renowned\r\nhero! O mirror of knighthood!\r\n\r\n    _Thy brandished whinyard all the world defies,\r\n    And kills as sure as del Tobosa's eyes._\r\n\r\nI am forced to break off abruptly, being sent for in haste, with my\r\nrule, to measure the degree of an affront, before the two gentlemen (who\r\nare now in their breeches and pumps ready to engage behind Montague\r\nHouse[320]) have made a pass.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom my own Apartment, June 18.\r\n\r\nIt is an unreasonable objection I find against my labours, that my stock\r\nis not all my own, and therefore the kind reception I have met with is\r\nnot so deserved as it ought to be. But I hope, though it be never so\r\ntrue that I am obliged to my friends for laying their cash in my hands,\r\nsince I give it them again when they please, and leave them at their\r\nliberty to call it home, it will not hurt me with my gentle readers. Ask\r\nall the merchants who act upon consignments, where is the necessity (if\r\nthey answer readily what their correspondents draw) of their being\r\nwealthy themselves? Ask the greatest bankers, if all the men they deal\r\nwith were to draw at once, what would be the consequence? But indeed a\r\ncountry friend has writ me a letter which gives me great mortification;\r\nwherein I find I am so far from expecting a supply from thence, that\r\nsome have not heard of me, and the rest do not understand me. His\r\nepistle is as follows:[321]\r\n\r\n\"DEAR COUSIN,\r\n\r\n\"I thought when I left the town to have raised your fame here, and\r\nhelped you to support it by intelligence from hence; but alas! they had\r\nnever heard of the _Tatler_ until I brought down a set. I lent them from\r\nhouse to house; but they asked me what they meant. I began to enlighten\r\nthem, by telling who and who were supposed to be intended by the\r\ncharacters drawn. I said for instance, Chloe[322] and Clarissa are two\r\neminent toasts. A gentleman (who keeps his greyhound and gun, and one\r\nwould think might know better) told me, he supposed they were papishes,\r\nfor their names were not English: 'Then,' said he, 'why do you call live\r\npeople \"toasts\"?' I answered, that was a new name found out by the wits,\r\nto make a lady have the same effect as burridge[323] in the glass when a\r\nman is drinking. 'But,' says I, 'sir, I perceive this is to you all\r\nbamboozling; why you look as if you were Don Diego'd[324] to the tune of\r\na thousand pounds.' All this good language was lost upon him: he only\r\nstared, though he is as good a scholar as any layman in the town, except\r\nthe barber. Thus, cousin, you must be content with London for the centre\r\nof your wealth and fame; we have no relish for you. Wit must describe\r\nits proper circumference, and not go beyond it, lest (like little boys,\r\nwhen they straggle out of their own parish), it may wander to places\r\nwhere it is not known, and be lost. Since it is so, you must excuse me\r\nthat I am forced at a visit to sit silent, and only lay up what\r\nexcellent things pass at such conversations.\r\n\r\n\"This evening I was with a couple of young ladies; one of them has the\r\ncharacter of the prettiest company, yet really I thought her but silly;\r\nthe other, who talked a great deal less, I observed to have\r\nunderstanding. The lady who is reckoned such a companion among her\r\nacquaintance, has only, with a very brisk air, a knack of saying the\r\ncommonest things: the other, with a sly serious one, says home things\r\nenough. The first (Mistress Giddy) is very quick; but the second (Mrs.\r\nSlim) fell into Giddy's own style, and was as good company as she. Giddy\r\nhappens to drop her glove; Slim reaches it to her: 'Madam,' says Giddy,\r\n'I hope you'll have a better office.' Upon which Slim immediately\r\nrepartees, and sits in her lap, and cries, 'Are you not sorry for my\r\nheaviness?' This sly wench pleased me to see how she hit her height of\r\nunderstanding so well. We sat down to supper. Says Giddy, mighty\r\nprettily, 'Two hands in a dish and one in a purse': says Slim, 'Ay,\r\nmadam, the more the merrier; but the fewer the better cheer.' I quickly\r\ntook the hint, and was as witty and talkative as they. Says I,\r\n\r\n    \"_'He that will not when he may,\r\n    When he will he shall have nay;'_\r\n\r\nand so helped myself. Giddy turns about, 'What, have you found your\r\ntongue?' 'Yes,' says I, 'it is manners to speak when I am spoken to; but\r\nyour greatest talkers are little doers, and the still sow eats up all\r\nthe broth.' 'Ha! ha!' says Giddy, 'one would think he had nothing in\r\nhim, and do you hear how he talks when he pleases.' I grew immediately\r\nroguish and pleasant to a degree in the same strain. Slim, who knew how\r\ngood company we had been, cries, 'You'll certainly print this bright\r\nconversation.'\"\r\n\r\nIt is so; and hereby you may see how small an appearance the prettiest\r\nthings said in company, make when in print.\r\n\r\n\r\nSt. James's Coffee-house, June 20.\r\n\r\nA mail from Lisbon has brought advices of June the 12th, from the King\r\nof Portugal's army encamped at Torre Allegada, which inform us, that the\r\ngeneral of the army called a court-martial on the 4th at the camp of\r\nGerumhena, where it was resolved to march with a design to attempt the\r\nsuccour of Olivenza. Accordingly the army moved on the 5th, and marched\r\ntowards Badajos. Upon their approach, the Marquis de Bay detached so\r\ngreat a party from the blockade of Olivenza, that the Marquis des Minas,\r\nat the head of a large detachment, covered a great convoy of provisions\r\ntowards Olivenza, which threw in their stores, and marched back to the\r\nmain army, without molestation from the Spaniards. They add, that each\r\narmy must necessarily march into quarters within twenty days.\r\n\r\nWhosoever can discover a surgeon's apprentice, who fell upon Mr.\r\nBickerstaff's messenger, or (as the printers call him) devil, going to\r\nthe press, and tore out of his hand part of his essay against duels, in\r\nthe fragments of which were the words, \"You lie,\" and \"Man of honour,\"\r\ntaken up at the Temple Gate; and the words, \"Perhaps,\"--\"May be\r\nnot,\"--\"By your leave, sir,\"--and other terms of provocation, taken up\r\nat the door of Young Man's Coffee-house,[325] shall receive satisfaction\r\nfrom Mr. Morphew, besides a set of arguments to be spoken to any man in\r\na passion, which, if the said enraged man listens to, will prevent\r\nquarrelling.\r\n\r\nMr. Bickerstaff does hereby give notice, that he has taken the two\r\nfamous universities of this land under his immediate care, and does\r\nhereby promise all tutors and pupils, that he will hear what can be said\r\nof each side between them, and to correct them impartially, by placing\r\nthem in orders and classes in the learned world, according to their\r\nmerit.[326]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 311: See Nos. 25, 26, 28, 29.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 312: Probably meant for Llanbadern Vawr, if not a name coined\r\nfor the occasion.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 313: Sir Anthony Fitzherbert's book was published in 1514.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 314: See Nos. 28, 134.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 315: See Selden, \"De Duello\" (1610), p. 19.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 316: A prize-fighter mentioned in Lansdowne's epilogue to \"The\r\nJew of Venice.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 317: \"Æneid,\" v. 437 _seq._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 318: Suetonius, \"Life of Nero,\" chap. 12.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 319: An allusion to the rubrics in Roman missals.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 320: The fields at the back of Montague House, Bloomsbury,\r\nwere a favourite place for duels in the first half of the eighteenth\r\ncentury.

To hear her talk seraphics, and run over\r\nNorris,[327] and More,[328] and Milton,[329] and the whole set of\r\nintellectual triflers, torments me heartily; for to a lover who\r\nunderstands metaphors, all this pretty prattle of ideas gives very fine\r\nviews of pleasure, which only the dear declaimer prevents, by\r\nunderstanding them literally. Why should she wish to be a cherubim, when\r\nit is flesh and blood that makes her adorable? If I speak to her, that\r\nis a high breach of the idea of intuition: if I offer at her hand or\r\nlip, she shrinks from the touch like a sensitive plant, and would\r\ncontract herself into mere spirit. She calls her chariot, 'vehicle'; her\r\nfurbelowed scarf, 'pinions': her blue mant and petticoat is her 'azure\r\ndress'; and her footman goes by the name of Oberon. It is my misfortune\r\nto be six foot and a half high, two full spans between the shoulders,\r\nthirteen inches diameter in the calves; and before I was in love, I had\r\na noble stomach, and usually went to bed sober with two bottles. I am\r\nnot quite six and twenty, and my nose is marked truly aquiline. For\r\nthese reasons, I am in a very particular manner her aversion. What shall\r\nI do? Impudence itself cannot reclaim her. If I write miserable, she\r\nreckons me among the children of perdition, and discards me her region:\r\nif I assume the gross and substantial, she plays the real ghost with me,\r\nand vanishes in a moment. I had hopes in the hypocrisy of her sex; but\r\nperseverance makes it as bad as fixed aversion. I desire your opinion,\r\nwhether I may not lawfully play the Inquisition upon her, make use of a\r\nlittle force, and put her to the rack and the torture, only to convince\r\nher she has really fine limbs, without spoiling or distorting them. I\r\nexpect your directions, ere I proceed to dwindle and fall away with\r\ndespair; which at present I don't think advisable; because, if she\r\nshould recant, she may then hate me perhaps in the other extreme for my\r\ntenuity. I am (with impatience) \"Your most humble Servant,\r\n\r\n                                        \"CHARLES STURDY.\"\r\n\r\nMy patient has put his case with very much warmth, and represented it in\r\nso lively a manner, that I see both his torment and tormentor with great\r\nperspicuity. This order of platonic ladies are to be dealt with in a\r\npeculiar manner from all the rest of the sex. Flattery is the general\r\nway, and the way in this case; but it is not to be done grossly. Every\r\nman that has wit, and humour, and raillery, can make a good flatterer\r\nfor woman in general; but a Platonne is not to be touched with\r\npanegyric: she will tell you, it is a sensuality in the soul to be\r\ndelighted that way. You are not therefore to commend, but silently\r\nconsent to all she does, and says. You are to consider in her the scorn\r\nof you is not humour, but opinion. There were some years since a set of\r\nthese ladies who were of quality, and gave out, that virginity was to be\r\ntheir state of life during this mortal condition, and therefore resolved\r\nto join their fortunes, and erect a nunnery. The place of residence was\r\npitched upon; and a pretty situation, full of natural falls and risings\r\nof waters, with shady coverts, and flowery arbours, was approved by\r\nseven of the founders. There were as many of our sex who took the\r\nliberty to visit those mansions of intended severity; among others, a\r\nfamous rake of that time, who had the grave way to an excellence. He\r\ncame in first; but upon seeing a servant coming towards him, with a\r\ndesign to tell him, this was no place for him or his companions, up goes\r\nmy grave impudence to the maid: \"Young woman,\" said he, \"if any of the\r\nladies are in the way on this side of the house, pray carry us on the\r\nother side towards the gardens: we are, you must know, gentlemen that\r\nare travelling England; after which we shall go into foreign parts,\r\nwhere some of us have already been.\" Here he bows in the most humble\r\nmanner, and kissed the girl, who knew not how to behave to such a sort\r\nof carriage. He goes on: \"Now you must know we have an ambition to have\r\nit to say, that we have a Protestant nunnery in England: but pray Mrs.\r\nBetty--\" \"Sir,\" she replied, \"my name is Susan, at your service.\" \"Then\r\nI heartily beg your pardon--\" \"No offence in the least,\" says she, \"for\r\nI have a cousin-german whose name is Betty.\" \"Indeed,\" said he, \"I\r\nprotest to you that was more than I knew, I spoke at random: but since\r\nit happens that I was near in the right, give me leave to present this\r\ngentleman to the favour of a civil salute.\" His friend advances, and so\r\non, till that they had all saluted her. By this means, the poor girl was\r\nin the middle of the crowd of these fellows, at a loss what to do,\r\nwithout courage to pass through them; and the Platonics, at several\r\npeep-holes, pale, trembling, and fretting. Rake perceived they were\r\nobserved, and therefore took care to keep Suky in chat with questions\r\nconcerning their way of life; when appeared at last Madonella,[330] a\r\nlady who had writ a fine book concerning the recluse life, and was the\r\nprojectrix of the foundation. She approaches into the hall; and Rake,\r\nknowing the dignity of his own mien and aspect, goes deputy from his\r\ncompany. She begins, \"Sir, I am obliged to follow the servant, who was\r\nsent out to know, what affair could make strangers press upon a solitude\r\nwhich we, who are to inhabit this place, have devoted to Heaven and our\r\nown thoughts?\" \"Madam,\" replies Rake, with an air of great distance,\r\nmixed with a certain indifference, by which he could dissemble\r\ndissimulation, \"your great intention has made more noise in the world\r\nthan you design it should; and we travellers, who have seen many foreign\r\ninstitutions of this kind, have a curiosity to see, in its first\r\nrudiments, this seat of primitive piety; for such it must be called by\r\nfuture ages, to the eternal honour of the founders. I have read\r\nMadonella's excellent and seraphic discourse on this subject.\" The lady\r\nimmediately answers, \"If what I have said could have contributed to\r\nraise any thoughts in you that may make for the advancement of\r\nintellectual and divine conversation, I should think myself extremely\r\nhappy.\" He immediately fell back with the profoundest veneration; then\r\nadvancing, \"Are you then that admired lady? If I may approach lips which\r\nhave uttered things so sacred--\" He salutes her. His friends follow his\r\nexample. The devoted within stood in amazement where this would end, to\r\nsee Madonella receive their address and their company. But Rake goes on,\r\n\"We would not transgress rules; but if we may take the liberty to see\r\nthe place you have thought fit to choose for ever, we would go into such\r\nparts of the gardens as is consistent with the severities you have\r\nimposed on yourselves.\" To be short, Madonella permitted Rake to lead\r\nher into the assembly of nuns, followed by his friends, and each took\r\nhis fair one by the hand, after due explanation, to walk round the\r\ngardens. The conversation turned upon the lilies, the flowers, the\r\narbors, and the growing vegetables; and Rake had the solemn impudence,\r\nwhen the whole company stood round him, to say, \"That he sincerely\r\nwished that men might rise out of the earth like plants; and that our\r\nminds were not of necessity to be sullied with carnivorous appetites for\r\nthe generation, as well as support of our species.\"[331] This was spoke\r\nwith so easy and fixed an assurance, that Madonella answered, \"Sir,\r\nunder the notion of a pious thought, you deceive yourself in wishing an\r\ninstitution foreign to that of Providence: these desires were implanted\r\nin us for reverent purposes, in preserving the race of men, and giving\r\nopportunities for making our chastity more heroic.\" The conference was\r\ncontinued in this celestial strain, and carried on so well by the\r\nmanagers on both sides, that it created a second and a third[332]\r\ninterview; and, without entering into further particulars, there was\r\nhardly one of them but was a mother or father that day twelve-month.\r\n\r\nAny unnatural part is long taking up, and as long laying aside;\r\ntherefore Mr. Sturdy may assure himself, Platonica will fly for ever\r\nfrom a forward behaviour; but if he approaches her according to this\r\nmodel, she will fall in with the necessities of mortal life, and\r\ncondescend to look with pity upon an unhappy man, imprisoned in so much\r\nbody, and urged by such violent desires.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom my own Apartment, June 22.\r\n\r\nThe evils of this town increase upon me to so great a degree, that I am\r\nhalf afraid I shall not leave the world much better than I found it.\r\nSeveral worthy gentlemen and critics have applied to me, to give my\r\ncensure of an enormity which has been revived (after being long\r\noppressed) and is called Punning.[333] I have several arguments ready to\r\nprove, that he cannot be a man of honour who is guilty of this abuse of\r\nhuman society. But the way to expose it, is like the expedient of curing\r\ndrunkenness, showing a man in that condition: therefore I must give my\r\nreader warning, to expect a collection of these offences; without which\r\npreparation, I thought it too adventurous to introduce the very mention\r\nof it in good company; and hope I shall be understood to do it, as a\r\ndivine mentions oaths and curses, only for their condemnation. I shall\r\ndedicate this discourse to a gentleman my very good friend, who is the\r\nJanus[334] of our times, and whom by his years and wit, you would take\r\nto be of the last age; but by his dress and morals, of this.\r\n\r\n\r\nSt. James's Coffee-house, June 22.\r\n\r\nLast night arrived two mails from Holland, which brings letters from the\r\nHague of the 28th instant, N.S., with advice, that the enemy lay\r\nencamped behind a strong retrenchment, with the marsh of Remières on\r\ntheir right and left, extending itself as far as Bethune: La Bassée is\r\nin their front, Lens in their rear, and their camp is strengthened by\r\nanother line from Lens to Douay. The Duke of Marlborough caused an exact\r\nobservation to be made of their ground, and the works by which they were\r\ncovered, which appeared so strong, that it was not thought proper to\r\nattack them in their present posture. However, the Duke thought fit to\r\nmake a feint as if he designed it; and accordingly marching from the\r\nabbey at Looze, as did Prince Eugene from Lampret, advanced with all\r\npossible diligence towards the enemy. To favour the appearance of an\r\nintended assault, the ways were made, and orders distributed in such a\r\nmanner, that none in either camp could have thoughts of anything but\r\ncharging the enemy by break of day the next morning: but soon after the\r\nfall of the night of the 26th, the whole army faced towards Tournay,\r\nwhich place they invested early in the morning of the 27th. The Marshal\r\nVillars was so confident that we designed to attack him, that he had\r\ndrawn great part of the garrison of the place, which is now invested,\r\ninto the field: for which reason, it is presumed it must submit within a\r\nsmall time; which the enemy cannot prevent, but by coming out of their\r\npresent camp, and hazarding a general engagement. These advices add,\r\nthat the garrison of Mons had marched out under the command of Marshal\r\nd'Arco; which, with the Bavarians, Walloons, and the troops of Cologne,\r\nhave joined the grand army of the enemy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 327: John Norris (1657-1711), the divine, published, in 1688,\r\n\"The Theory and Regulation of Love, a Moral Essay; to which are added\r\nLetters Philosophical and Moral between the author and Doctor Henry\r\nMore.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 328: Henry More, the platonist (1614-87), published \"Divine\r\nDialogues,\" \"Conjectura Cabalistica,\" and many other works.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 329: It is not clear why Milton is bracketed with Norris and\r\nMore; perhaps Swift had in mind such passages about heavenly love as\r\nthat in \"Paradise Lost,\" viii. 588-614.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 330: Swift seems to have been the author of this first portion\r\nof No. 32, which contains a scandalous attack on Mary Astell. Nichols\r\nthought that Addison also had a share in it. See Nos. 59, 63. Mrs.\r\nAstell, a friend of Lady Elizabeth Hastings and John Norris, published,\r\nin 1694, her \"Serious Proposal to the Ladies,\" advocating a Church of\r\nEngland monastery, without any irrevocable vows. Provision was made for\r\nmental as well as moral training; in fact, the institution was to have\r\nbeen \"rather academical than monastic.\" But Bishop Burnet advised Lady\r\nElizabeth Hastings not to subscribe to the proposed building, and the\r\nscheme fell through. In 1709, Miss Astell published a book called\r\n\"Bart'lemy Fair; or, An Enquiry after Wit.... By Mr. Wotton, in answer\r\nto Lord Shaftesbury's Letter concerning Enthusiasm, and other profane\r\nwriters.\" In the advertisement to the Second Edition (\"An Enquiry after\r\nWit,\" &c., 1722), Mary Astell says that, although her book was at first\r\npublished under a borrowed name, it was ascribed to her, and drew upon\r\nher the resentment of that sort of men of wit who were exposed, and was\r\nthe true cause of the fable published in the _Tatler_ a little after the\r\n\"Enquiry\" appeared. But she notes that, although the _Tatler_ showed its\r\nteeth against the \"Proposal to the Ladies,\" the compilator made amends\r\nto the author (if not to the bookseller), by transcribing above a\r\nhundred pages into his _Ladies' Library_ verbatim, except in a few\r\nplaces, which would not be found to be improved. The \"Enquiry after Wit\"\r\nis dedicated \"To the most Illustrious Society of the Kit-Cats,\" with\r\nmany sarcastic allusions to their luxury, oaths, &c. True, their names\r\nhad not been heard of from Hochsted or Ramillies, but then their heroism\r\nfound in every place an ample theatre for their merits. \"The Bath, the\r\nWells, and every Fair, each Chocolate, Gaming House and Tavern resounds\r\nwith your noble exploits.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 331: This is borrowed from Sir Thomas Browne's \"Religio\r\nMedici,\" part ii. sect. 9.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 332: \"Second,\" in original editions.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 333: There is an apology for punning in No. 36 of the\r\n_Guardian_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 334: Swift.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 33. [STEELE.\r\n\r\nBy Mrs. JENNY DISTAFF, half-sister to Mr. BICKERSTAFF.\r\n\r\nFrom _Thursday, June 23_, to _Saturday, June 25_, 1709.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom my own Apartment, June 23.\r\n\r\nMy brother has made an excursion into the country, and the work against\r\nSaturday lies upon me. I am very glad I have got pen and ink in my hand;\r\nfor I have for some time longed for his absence, to give a right idea of\r\nthings, which I thought he put in a very odd light, and some of them to\r\nthe disadvantage of my own sex. It is much to be lamented, that it is\r\nnecessary to make discourses, and publish treatises, to keep the horrid\r\ncreatures, the men, within the rules of common decency. Turning over the\r\npapers of memorials or hints for the ensuing discourses, I find a letter\r\nsubscribed by Mr. Truman.\r\n\r\n\"SIR,\r\n\r\n\"I am lately come to town, and have read your works with much pleasure.\r\nYou make wit subservient to good principles and good manners. Yet,\r\nbecause I design to buy the _Tatlers_ for my daughters to read, I take\r\nthe freedom to desire you, for the future, to say nothing about any\r\ncombat between Alexander and Thalestris.\"[335]\r\n\r\nThis offence gives me occasion to express myself with the resentment I\r\nought, on people who take liberties of speech before that sex of whom\r\nthe honoured names of mother, daughter, and sister, are a part: I had\r\nliked to have named wife in the number; but the senseless world are so\r\nmistaken in their sentiments of pleasure, that the most amiable term in\r\nhuman life is become the derision of fools and scorners. My brother and\r\nI have at least fifty times quarrelled upon this topic. I ever argue,\r\nthat the frailties of women are to be imputed to the false ornaments\r\nwhich men of wit put upon our folly and coquetry. He lays all the vices\r\nof men upon women's secret approbation of libertine characters in them.\r\nI did not care to give up a point; but now he is out of the way, I\r\ncannot but own I believe there is very much in what he asserted: for if\r\nyou will believe your eyes, and own, that the wickedest and the wittiest\r\nof them all marry one day or other, is it possible to believe, that if a\r\nman thought he should be for ever incapable of being received by a woman\r\nof merit and honour, he would persist in an abandoned way, and deny\r\nhimself the possibility of enjoying the happiness of well-governed\r\ndesires, orderly satisfactions, and honourable methods of life? If our\r\nsex were wise, a lover should have a certificate from the last woman he\r\nserved, how he was turned away, before he was received into the service\r\nof another: but at present any vagabond is welcome, provided he promises\r\nto enter into our livery. It is wonderful, that we will not take a\r\nfootman without credentials from his last master; and in the greatest\r\nconcern of life, we make no scruple of falling into a treaty with the\r\nmost notorious offender in his behaviour against others. But this breach\r\nof commerce between the sexes, proceeds from an unaccountable prevalence\r\nof custom, by which a woman is to the last degree reproachable for being\r\ndeceived, and a man suffers no loss of credit for being a deceiver.\r\nSince this tyrant humour has gained place, why are we represented in the\r\nwritings of men in ill figures for artifice in our carriage, when we\r\nhave to do with a professed impostor? When oaths, imprecations, vows,\r\nand adorations, are made use of as words of course, what arts are not\r\nnecessary to defend us from such as glory in the breach of them? As for\r\nmy part, I am resolved to hear all, and believe none of them; and\r\ntherefore solemnly declare, no vow shall deceive me, but that of\r\nmarriage: for I am turned of twenty, and being of a small fortune, some\r\nwit, and (if I can believe my lovers and my glass) handsome, I have\r\nheard all that can be said towards my undoing, and shall therefore, for\r\nwarning sake, give an account of the offers that have been made me, my\r\nmanner of rejecting them, and my assistances to keep my resolution. In\r\nthe sixteenth year of my life, I fell into the acquaintance of a lady,\r\nextremely well known in this town for the quick advancement of her\r\nhusband, and the honours and distinctions which her industry has\r\nprocured him, and all who belong to her. This excellent body sat next to\r\nme for some months at church, and took the liberty (which she said her\r\nyears and the zeal she had for my welfare gave her claim to) to assure\r\nme, that she observed some parts of my behaviour which would lead me\r\ninto errors, and give encouragement to some to entertain hopes I did not\r\nthink of. \"What made you,\" said she, \"look through your fan at that\r\nlord, when your eyes should have been turned upward, or closed in\r\nattention upon better objects?\" I blushed, and pretended fifty odd\r\nexcuses;--but confounded myself the more. She wanted nothing but to see\r\nthat confusion, and goes on: \"Nay, child, do not be troubled that I take\r\nnotice of it, my value for you made me speak it; for though he is my\r\nkinsman, I have a nearer regard to virtue than any other consideration.\"\r\nShe had hardly done speaking, when this noble lord came up to us, and\r\ntook her hand to lead her to her coach. My head ran all that day and\r\nnight on the exemplary carriage of this woman who could be so virtuously\r\nimpertinent, as to admonish one she was hardly acquainted with.\r\nHowever, it struck upon the vanity of a girl that it may possibly be,\r\nhis thoughts might have been as favourable of me, as mine were amorous\r\nof him, and as unlikely things as that have happened, if he should make\r\nme his wife. She never mentioned this more to me; but I still in all\r\npublic places stole looks at this man, who easily observed my passion\r\nfor him. It is so hard a thing to check the return of agreeable\r\nthoughts, that he became my dream, my vision, my food, my wish, my\r\ntorment. That minister of darkness, the Lady Sempronia,[336] perceived\r\ntoo well the temper I was in, and would one day after evening service\r\nneeds take me to the Park. When we were there, my lord passes by; I\r\nflushed into a flame. \"Mrs. Distaff,\" said she, \"you may very well\r\nremember the concern I was in upon the first notice I took of your\r\nregard to that lord, and forgive me, who had a tender friendship for\r\nyour mother (now in her grave) that I am vigilant of your conduct.\" She\r\nwent on with much severity, and after great solicitation, prevailed on\r\nme to go with her into the country, and there spend the ensuing summer\r\nout of the way of a man she saw I loved, and one whom she perceived\r\nmeditated my ruin, by frequently desiring her to introduce him to me;\r\nwhich she absolutely refused, except he would give his honour that he\r\nhad no other design but to marry me. To her country house a week or two\r\nafter we went: there was at the farther end of her garden a kind of\r\nwilderness, in the middle of which ran a soft rivulet by an arbour of\r\njessamine. In this place I usually passed my retired hours, and read\r\nsome romantic or poetical tale till the close of the evening. It was\r\nnear that time in the heat of summer, when gentle winds, soft murmurs\r\nof water, and notes of nightingales had given my mind an indolence,\r\nwhich added to that repose of soul, which twilight and the end of a warm\r\nday naturally throws upon the spirits. It was at such an hour, and in\r\nsuch a state of tranquillity I sat, when, to my unexpressible amazement,\r\nI saw my lord walking towards me, whom I knew not till that moment to\r\nhave been in the country. I could observe in his approach the perplexity\r\nwhich attends a man big with design; and I had, while he was coming\r\nforward, time to reflect that I was betrayed; the sense of which gave me\r\na resentment suitable to such a baseness: but when he entered into the\r\nbower where I was, my heart flew towards him, and, I confess, a certain\r\njoy came into my mind, with a hope that he might then make a declaration\r\nof honour and passion. This threw my eye upon him with such tenderness,\r\nas gave him power, with a broken accent, to begin. \"Madam,--You will\r\nwonder--For it is certain, you must have observed--though I fear you\r\nwill misinterpret the motives--But by Heaven, and all that's sacred! If\r\nyou could--\" Here he made a full stand. And I recovered power to say,\r\n\"The consternation I am in you will not, I hope, believe--A helpless\r\ninnocent maid--Besides that, the place--\" He saw me in as great\r\nconfusion as himself; which attributing to the same causes, he had the\r\naudaciousness to throw himself at my feet, and talk of the stillness of\r\nthe evening; then ran into deifications of my person, pure flames,\r\nconstant love, eternal raptures, and a thousand other phrases drawn from\r\nthe images we have of heaven, which ill men use for the service of hell,\r\nwere run over with uncommon vehemence. After which, he seized me in his\r\narms: his design was too evident. In my utmost distress, I fell upon my\r\nknees--\"My lord, pity me, on my knees--On my knees in the cause of\r\nvirtue, as you were lately in that of wickedness. Can you think of\r\ndestroying the labour of a whole life, the purpose of a long education,\r\nfor the base service of a sudden appetite, to throw one that loves you,\r\nthat dotes on you, out of the company and road of all that is virtuous\r\nand praiseworthy? Have I taken in all the instructions of piety,\r\nreligion, and reason, for no other end, but to be the sacrifice of lust,\r\nand abandoned to scorn? Assume yourself, my lord, and do not attempt to\r\nvitiate a temple sacred to innocence, honour, and religion. If I have\r\ninjured you, stab this bosom, and let me die, but not be ruined by the\r\nhand I love.\" The ardency of my passion made me incapable of uttering\r\nmore; and I saw my lover astonished and reformed by my behaviour: when\r\nrushed in Sempronia. \"Ha! Faithless, base man, could you then steal out\r\nof town, and lurk like a robber about my house for such brutish\r\npurposes?\" My lord was by this time recovered, and fell into a violent\r\nlaughter at the turn which Sempronia designed to give her villany. He\r\nbowed to me with the utmost respect: \"Mrs. Distaff,\" said he, \"be\r\ncareful hereafter of your company\"; and so retired. The fiend Sempronia\r\ncongratulated my deliverance with a flood of tears. This nobleman has\r\nsince very frequently made his addresses to me with honour, but I have\r\nas often refused them; as well knowing, that familiarity and marriage\r\nwill make him, on some ill-natured occasion, call all I said in the\r\narbour a theatrical action. Besides that, I glory in contemning a man\r\nwho had thoughts to my dishonour. And if this method were the imitation\r\nof the whole sex, innocence would be the only dress of beauty; and all\r\naffectation by any other arts to please the eyes of men, would be\r\nbanished to the stews for ever. The conquest of passion gives ten times\r\nmore happiness than we can reap from the gratification of it; and she\r\nthat has got over such a one as mine, will stand among beaux and pretty\r\nfellows, with as much safety as in a summer's day among grasshoppers and\r\nbutterflies.\r\n\r\nP.S.--I have ten millions of things more against men, if I ever get the\r\npen again.\r\n\r\n\r\nSt. James's Coffee-house, June 24.\r\n\r\nOur last advices from the Hague, dated the 28th instant, say, that on\r\nthe 25th a squadron of Dutch men-of-war sailed out of the Texel to join\r\nAdmiral Baker at Spithead. The 26th was observed as a day of fasting and\r\nhumiliation, to implore a blessing on the arms of the Allies this\r\nensuing campaign. Letters from Dresden are very particular in the\r\naccount of the gallantry and magnificence in which that Court has\r\nappeared since the arrival of the King of Denmark. No day has passed in\r\nwhich public shows have not been exhibited for his entertainment and\r\ndiversion: the last of that kind which is mentioned is a carousal,\r\nwherein many of the youth of the first quality, dressed in the most\r\nsplendid manner, ran for the prize. His Danish Majesty condescended to\r\nthe same; but having observed that there was a design laid to throw it\r\nin his way, passed by without attempting to gain it. The Court of\r\nDresden was preparing to accompany his Danish Majesty to Potsdam, where\r\nthe expectation of an interview of three kings had drawn together such\r\nmultitudes of people, that many persons of distinction will be obliged\r\nto lie in tents as long as those Courts continue in that place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 335: See No. 31.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 336: See Sallust, \"Bell.

[STEELE.\r\n\r\nBy ISAAC BICKERSTAFF, Esq.\r\n\r\nFrom _Saturday, June 25_, to _Tuesday, June 28, 1709._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nWhite's Chocolate-house, June 25.\r\n\r\nHaving taken upon me to cure all the distempers which proceed from\r\naffections of the mind, I have laboured since I first kept this public\r\nstage, to do all the good I could possibly, and have perfected many\r\ncures at my own lodging; carefully avoiding the common method of\r\nmountebanks, to do their most eminent operations in sight of the people;\r\nbut must be so just to my patients as to declare, they have testified\r\nunder their hands their sense of my poor abilities, and the good I have\r\ndone them, which I publish for the benefit of the world, and not out of\r\nany thoughts of private advantage. I have cured fine Mrs. Spy of a great\r\nimperfection in her eyes, which made her eternally rolling them from one\r\ncoxcomb to another in public places, in so languishing a manner, that it\r\nat once lessened her own power, and her beholder's vanity. Twenty drops\r\nof my ink, placed in certain letters on which she attentively looked for\r\nhalf an hour, have restored her to the true use of her sight; which is,\r\nto guide, and not mislead us. Ever since she took this liquor, which I\r\ncall Bickerstaff's Circumspection Water, she looks right forward, and\r\ncan bear being looked at for half a day without returning one glance.\r\nThis water has a peculiar virtue in it, which makes it the only true\r\ncosmetic or beauty wash in the world: the nature of it is such, that if\r\nyou go to a glass, with design to admire your face, it immediately\r\nchanges it into downright deformity. If you consult it only to look\r\nwith a better countenance upon your friends, it immediately gives an\r\nalacrity to the visage, and new grace to the whole person. There is\r\nindeed a great deal owing to the constitution of the person to whom it\r\nis applied: it is in vain to give it when the patient is in the rage of\r\nthe distemper; a bride in her first month, a lady soon after her\r\nhusband's being knighted, or any person of either sex who has lately\r\nobtained any new good fortune or preferment, must be prepared some time\r\nbefore they use it. It has an effect upon others, as well as the\r\npatient, when it is taken in due form. Lady Petulant has by the use of\r\nit cured her husband of jealousy, and Lady Gad her whole neighbourhood\r\nof detraction. The fame of these things, added to my being an old\r\nfellow, makes me extremely acceptable to the fair sex. You would hardly\r\nbelieve me, when I tell you there is not a man in town so much their\r\ndelight as myself. They make no more of visiting me, than going to Madam\r\nd'Epingle's.[337] There were two of them, namely, Damia and Clidamira (I\r\nassure you women of distinction) who came to see me this morning in\r\ntheir way to prayers, and being in a very diverting humour as (innocence\r\nalways makes people cheerful) they would needs have me, according to the\r\ndistinction of \"pretty\" and \"very pretty\" fellows, inform them if I\r\nthought either of them had a title to the \"very pretty\" among those of\r\ntheir own sex; and if I did, which was the more deserving of the two. To\r\nput them to the trial, \"Look ye,\" said I, \"I must not rashly give my\r\njudgment in matters of this importance; pray let me see you dance: I\r\nplay upon the kit.\"[338] They immediately fell back to the lower end of\r\nthe room (you may be sure they curtsied low enough to me): and began.\r\nNever were two in the world so equally matched, and both scholars to my\r\nnamesake Isaac.[339] Never was man in so dangerous a condition as\r\nmyself, when they began to expand their charms. \"O! ladies, ladies,\"\r\ncried I, \"not half that air, you'll fire the house.\" Both smiled; for\r\nby-the bye, there's no carrying a metaphor too far, when a lady's charms\r\nare spoken of. Somebody, I think, has called a fine woman dancing, a\r\nbrandished torch of beauty.[340] These rivals moved with such an\r\nagreeable freedom, that you would believe their gesture was the\r\nnecessary effect of the music, and not the product of skill and\r\npractice. Now Clidamira came on with a crowd of graces, and demanded my\r\njudgment with so sweet an air--and she had no sooner carried it, but\r\nDamia made her utterly forgot by a gentle sinking, and a rigadoon\r\nstep.[341] The contest held a full half-hour; and I protest, I saw no\r\nmanner of difference in their perfections, till they came up together,\r\nand expected my sentence. \"Look ye, ladies,\" said I, \"I see no\r\ndifference in the least in your performance; but you Clidamira seem to\r\nbe so well satisfied that I shall determine for you, that I must give it\r\nto Damia, who stands with so much diffidence and fear, after showing an\r\nequal merit to what she pretends to. Therefore, Clidamira, you are a\r\n'pretty'; but, Damia, you are a 'very pretty' lady. For,\" said I,\r\n\"beauty loses its force, if not accompanied with modesty. She that has a\r\nhumble opinion of herself, will have everybody's applause, because she\r\ndoes not expect it; while the vain creature loses approbation through\r\ntoo great a sense of deserving it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom my own Apartment, June 27.\r\n\r\nBeing of a very spare and hective constitution, I am forced to make\r\nfrequent journeys of a mile or two for fresh air; and indeed by this\r\nlast, which was no further than the village of Chelsea, I am farther\r\nconvinced of the necessity of travelling to know the world. For as it is\r\nusual with young voyagers, as soon as they land upon a shore, to begin\r\ntheir accounts of the nature of the people, their soil, their\r\ngovernment, their inclinations, and their passions, so really I fancied\r\nI could give you an immediate description of this village, from the Five\r\nFields,[342] where the robbers lie in wait, to the coffee-house where\r\nthe _literati_ sit in council. A great ancestor of ours by the mother's\r\nside, Mr. Justice Overdo (whose history is written by Ben Jonson),[343]\r\nmet with more enormities by walking _incog._ than he was capable of\r\ncorrecting; and found great mortifications in observing also persons of\r\neminence, whom he before knew nothing of. Thus it fared with me, even in\r\na place so near the town as this. When I came into the\r\ncoffee-house,[344] I had not time to salute the company, before my eye\r\nwas diverted by ten thousand gimcracks round the room and on the\r\nceiling. When my first astonishment was over, comes to me a sage of a\r\nthin and meagre countenance; which aspect made me doubt, whether reading\r\nor fretting had made it so philosophic: but I very soon perceived him to\r\nbe of that sect which the ancients call Gingivistæ,[345] in our\r\nlanguage, tooth-drawers. I immediately had a respect for the man; for\r\nthese practical philosophers go upon a very rational hypothesis, not to\r\ncure, but take away the part affected. My love of mankind made me very\r\nbenevolent to Mr. Salter, for such is the name of this eminent barber\r\nand antiquary. Men are usually, but unjustly, distinguished rather by\r\ntheir fortunes, than their talents, otherwise this personage would make\r\na great figure in that class of men which I distinguish under the title\r\nof Odd Fellows. But it is the misfortune of persons of great genius, to\r\nhave their faculties dissipated by attention to too many things at once.\r\nMr. Salter is an instance of this: if he would wholly give himself up to\r\nthe string,[346] instead of playing twenty beginnings to tunes, he might\r\nbefore he dies play \"Roger de Caubly\"[347] quite out. I heard him go\r\nthrough his whole round, and indeed I think he does play the \"Merry\r\nChrist-Church Bells\"[348] pretty justly; but he confessed to me, he did\r\nthat rather to show he was orthodox, than that he valued himself upon\r\nthe music itself. Or if he did proceed in his anatomy, why might not he\r\nhope in time to cut off legs, as well as draw teeth? The particularity\r\nof this man put me into a deep thought, whence it should proceed, that\r\nof all the lower order barbers should go farther in hitting the\r\nridiculous, than any other set of men. Watermen brawl, cobblers sing;\r\nbut why must a barber be for ever a politician, a musician, an\r\nanatomist, a poet, and a physician? The learned Vossus says,[349] his\r\nbarber used to comb his head in iambics. And indeed in all ages, one of\r\nthis useful profession, this order of cosmetic philosophers, has been\r\ncelebrated by the most eminent hands. You see the barber in \"Don\r\nQuixote,\"[350] is one of the principal characters in the history, which\r\ngave me satisfaction in the doubt, why Don Saltero writ his name with a\r\nSpanish termination: for he is descended in a right line, not from John\r\nTradescant,[351] as he himself asserts, but from that memorable\r\ncompanion of the Knight of Mancha. And I hereby certify all the worthy\r\ncitizens who travel to see his rarities, that his double-barrelled\r\npistols, targets, coats of mail, his sclopeta,[352] and sword of\r\nToledo,[353] were left to his ancestor by the said Don Quixote, and by\r\nthe said ancestor to all his progeny down to Don Saltero. Though I go\r\nthus far in favour of Don Saltero's great merit, I cannot allow a\r\nliberty he takes of imposing several names (without my licence) on the\r\ncollections he has made, to the abuse of the good people of England; one\r\nof which is particularly calculated to deceive religious persons, to the\r\ngreat scandal of the well disposed, and may introduce heterodox\r\nopinions. He shows you a straw hat, which I know to be made by Madge\r\nPeskad, within three miles of Bedford; and tells you, it is Pontius\r\nPilate's wife's chamber-maid's sister's hat. To my knowledge of this\r\nvery hat, it may be added, that the covering of straw was never used\r\namong the Jews, since it was demanded of them to make bricks without it.\r\nTherefore this is really nothing, but under the specious pretence of\r\nlearning and antiquity, to impose upon the world. There are other things\r\nwhich I cannot tolerate among his rarities; as, the china figure of a\r\nlady in the glass case; the Italian engine for the imprisonment of those\r\nwho go abroad with it: both which I hereby order to be taken down, or\r\nelse he may expect to have his letters patents for making punch\r\nsuperseded, be debarred wearing his muff next winter, or ever coming to\r\nLondon without his wife.[354] It may perhaps be thought I have dwelt too\r\nlong upon the affairs of this operator; but I desire the reader to\r\nremember, that it is my way to consider men as they stand in merit, and\r\nnot according to their fortune or figure; and if he is in a coffee-house\r\nat the reading hereof, let him look round, and he will find there may be\r\nmore characters drawn in this account than that of Don Saltero; for half\r\nthe politicians about him, he may observe, are, by their place in\r\nnature, of the class of tooth-drawers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 337: See p. 273, note.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 338: A small violin or fiddle.

[STEELE.\r\n\r\nFrom _Tuesday, June 28_, to _Thursday, June 30_, 1709.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nGrecian Coffee-house, June 28.\r\n\r\nThere is a habit or custom which I have put my patience to the utmost\r\nstretch to have suffered so long, because several of my intimate friends\r\nare in the guilt; and that is, the humour of taking snuff, and looking\r\ndirty about the mouth by way of ornament. My method is to dive to the\r\nbottom of a sore before I pretend to apply a remedy. For this reason, I\r\nsat by an eminent story-teller and politician who takes half an ounce in\r\nfive seconds, and has mortgaged a pretty tenement near the town, merely\r\nto improve and dung his brains with this prolific powder. I observed\r\nthis gentleman the other day in the midst of a story diverted from it by\r\nlooking at something at a distance, and I softly hid his box. But he\r\nreturns to his tale, and looking for his box, he cries, \"And so, sir--\"\r\nThen when he should have taken a pinch, \"As I was saying,\" says he--\"Has\r\nnobody seen my box?\" His friend beseeches him to finish his narration.\r\nThen he proceeds, \"And so, sir--Where can my box be?\" Then, turning to\r\nme, \"Pray, sir, did you see my box?\" \"Yes, sir,\" said I, \"I took it to\r\nsee how long you could live without it.\" He resumes his tale; and I took\r\nnotice, that his dulness was much more regular and fluent than before. A\r\npinch supplied the place of, \"As I was saying,\" \"And so, sir\"; and he\r\nwent on currently enough in that style which the learned call the\r\ninsipid. This observation easily led me into a philosophic reason for\r\ntaking snuff, which is done only to supply with sensations the want of\r\nreflection. This I take to be an Ἕυρηκα [Heurêka], a nostrum; upon which\r\nI hope to receive the thanks of this board. For as it is natural to lift\r\na man's hand to a sore, when you fear anything coming at you; so when a\r\nperson feels his thoughts are run out, and has no more to say, it is as\r\nnatural to supply his weak brain with powder at the nearest place of\r\naccess, viz., the nostrils. This is so evident, that nature suggests the\r\nuse according to the indigence of the persons who use this medicine,\r\nwithout being prepossessed with the force of fashion or custom. For\r\nexample; the native Hibernians, who are reckoned not much unlike the\r\nancient Bœotians, take this specific for emptiness in the head, in\r\ngreater abundance than any other nation under the sun. The learned\r\nSotus, as sparing as he is in his words, would be still more silent if\r\nit were not for this powder. But however low and poor the taking snuff\r\nargues a man to be in his own stock of thought, or means to employ his\r\nbrains and his fingers, yet there is a poorer creature in the world than\r\nhe, and this is a borrower of snuff; a fellow that keeps no box of his\r\nown, but is always asking others for a pinch. Such poor rogues put me\r\nalways in mind of a common phrase among schoolboys when they are\r\ncomposing their exercise, who run to an upper scholar, and cry, \"Pray\r\ngive me a little sense.\" But of all things, commend me to the ladies who\r\nare got into this pretty help to discourse.[355] I have been this three\r\nyears persuading Sagissa[356] to leave it off; but she talks so much,\r\nand is so learned, that she is above contradiction. However, an\r\naccident the other day brought that about, which my eloquence never\r\ncould accomplish: she had a very pretty fellow in her closet, who ran\r\nthither to avoid some company that came to visit her. She made an excuse\r\nto go in to him for some implement they were talking of. Her eager\r\ngallant snatched a kiss; but being unused to snuff, some grains from off\r\nher upper lip made him sneeze aloud, which alarmed the visitants, and\r\nhas made a discovery, that profound reading, very much intelligence, and\r\na general knowledge of who and who's together, cannot fill up her vacant\r\nhours so much, but that she is sometimes obliged to descend to\r\nentertainments less intellectual.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhite's Chocolate-house, June 29.\r\n\r\nI know no manner of news for this place, but that Cynthio, having been\r\nlong in despair for the inexorable Clarissa, lately resolved to fall in\r\nlove the good old way of bargain and sale, and has pitched upon a very\r\nagreeable young woman.[357] He will undoubtedly succeed; for he accosts\r\nher in a strain of familiarity, without breaking through the deference\r\nthat is due to woman whom a man would choose for his life. I have hardly\r\never heard rough truth spoken with a better grace than in this his\r\nletter.[358]\r\n\r\n\"MADAM,\r\n\r\n\"I writ to you on Saturday by Mrs. Lucy, and give you this trouble to\r\nurge the same request I made then, which was, that I may be admitted to\r\nwait upon you. I should be very far from desiring this, if it were a\r\ntransgression of the most severe rules to allow it: I know you are very\r\nmuch above the little arts which are frequent in your sex, of giving\r\nunnecessary torments to their admirers; therefore hope, you'll do so\r\nmuch justice to the generous passion I have for you, as to let me have\r\nan opportunity of acquainting you upon what motives I pretend to your\r\ngood opinion. I shall not trouble you with my sentiments, till I know\r\nhow they will be received; and as I know no reason why difference of sex\r\nshould make our language to each other differ from the ordinary rules of\r\nright reason, I shall affect plainness and sincerity in my discourse to\r\nyou, as much as other lovers do perplexity and rapture. Instead of\r\nsaying, 'I shall die for you,' I profess I should be glad to lead my\r\nlife with you: you are as beautiful, as witty, as prudent, and as\r\ngood-humoured, as any woman breathing; but I must confess to you, I\r\nregard all these excellences as you will please to direct them, for my\r\nhappiness or misery. With me, madam, the only lasting motive to love is\r\nthe hope of its becoming mutual. I beg of you to let Mrs. Lucy send me\r\nword when I may attend you. I promise you, I'll talk of nothing but\r\nindifferent things; though at the same time I know not how I shall\r\napproach you in the tender moment of first seeing you, after this\r\ndeclaration, of,\r\n\r\n\"Madam,\r\n\r\n\"Your most obedient,\r\n\r\n\"And most faithful\r\n\r\n\"Humble Servant, &c.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWill's Coffee-house, June 29.\r\n\r\nHaving taken a resolution when plays are acted next winter by an entire\r\ngood company, to publish observations from time to time on the\r\nperformance of the actors, I think it but just to give an abstract of\r\nthe law of action, for the help of the less learned part of the\r\naudience, that they may rationally enjoy so refined and instructive a\r\npleasure as a just representation of human life. The great errors in\r\nplaying are admirably well exposed in Hamlet's direction to the\r\nactors[359] who are to play in his supposed tragedy; by which we shall\r\nform our future judgments on their behaviour, and for that reason you\r\nhave the discourse as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Speak the speech as I pronounce it to you, trippingly on the tongue;\r\nbut if you mouth it, as many of our players do, I had as lieve the\r\ntown-crier had spoke my lines: nor do not saw the air too much with your\r\nhand thus; but use all gently: for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as\r\nI may say, the whirlwind of passion, you must acquire and beget a\r\ntemperance that may give it smoothness. Oh! it offends me to the soul,\r\nto see a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to\r\nvery rags, to split the ears of the groundlings, who (for the most part)\r\nare capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb shows and noise. I could\r\nhave such a fellow whipped for overdoing termagant: it out-Herods Herod.\r\nBe not too tame neither; but let your own discretion be your tutor: suit\r\nthe action to the word, the word to the action; with this special\r\nobservance, that you overstep not the modesty of nature; for anything so\r\noverdone, is from the purpose of playing, whose end, both at the first\r\nand now, was, and is, to hold as it were the mirror up to Nature; to\r\nshow Virtue her own feature; scorn her own image; and the very age and\r\nbody of the time its form and pressure. Now this overdone, or come tardy\r\noff, though it make the unskilful laugh, cannot but make the judicious\r\ngrieve. The censures of which one, must, in your allowance, oversway a\r\nwhole theatre of others. Oh! there be players, that I have seen play,\r\nand heard others praise, and that highly (not to speak it profanely),\r\nthat neither having the accent of Christian, Pagan, or Norman, have so\r\nstrutted and bellowed, that I have thought some of Nature's journeymen\r\nhad made men, and not made them well, they imitated humanity so\r\nabominably. This should be reformed altogether; and let those that play\r\nyour clowns, speak no more than is set down for them: for there be of\r\nthem that will of themselves laugh, to set on some quantity of barren\r\nspectators to laugh too; though in the meantime, some necessary question\r\nof the play be then to be considered; that is villanous, and shows a\r\nmost pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom my own Apartment, June 29.\r\n\r\nIt would be a very great obligation, and an assistance to my treatise\r\nupon Punning,[360] if any one would please to inform in what class,\r\namong the learned who play with words, to place the author of the\r\nfollowing letter.[361]\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\r\n\r\n\"Not long since you were pleased to give us a chimerical account of the\r\nfamous family of Staffs,[362] from whence I suppose you would insinuate,\r\nthat it is the most ancient and numerous house in all Europe.

Eight men were drawn out of\r\neach troop of dragoons and company of foot in the garrison of Tournay,\r\nto make up the reinforcement which was ordered to join Marshal Villars;\r\nbut upon advice that the Allies were marching towards Tournay, they\r\nendeavoured to return into the town; but were intercepted by the Earl of\r\nOrkney, by whom that whole body was killed or taken. These letters add,\r\nthat 1200 dragoons (each horseman carrying a foot-soldier behind him)\r\nwere detached from Mons to throw themselves into Tournay; but upon\r\nappearance of a great body of horse of the Allies, retired towards\r\nCondé. We hear, that the garrison does not consist of more than 3500\r\nmen. Of the sixty battalions designed to be employed in this siege,\r\nseven [_sic_] are English, viz., two of Guards, and the regiments of\r\nArgyle, Temple, Evans and Meredith.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 355: See Nos. 79, 140; and Swift's \"Journal to Stella,\" Nov.\r\n3, 1711.

[? STEELE.[363]\r\n\r\nBy Mrs. JENNY DISTAFF, half-sister to Mr. BICKERSTAFF.\r\n\r\nFrom _Thursday, June 30_, to _Saturday, July 2_, 1709.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom our own Apartment, June 30.\r\n\r\nMany affairs calling my brother into the country, the care of our\r\nintelligence with the town is left to me for some time; therefore you\r\nmust expect the advices you meet with in this paper to be such as more\r\nimmediately and naturally fall under the consideration of our sex:\r\nhistory therefore written by a woman, you will easily imagine to consist\r\nof love in all its forms, both in the abuse of, and obedience to that\r\npassion. As to the faculty of writing itself, it will not, it is hoped,\r\nbe demanded, that style and ornament shall be so much consulted, as\r\ntruth and simplicity; which latter qualities we may more justly pretend\r\nto beyond the other sex. While therefore the administration of our\r\naffairs is in my hands, you shall from time to time have an exact\r\naccount of all false lovers, and their shallow pretences for breaking\r\noff; of all termagant wives who make wedlock a yoke; of men who affect\r\nthe entertainments and manners suitable only to our sex, and women who\r\npretend to the conduct of such affairs as are only within the province\r\nof men. It is necessary further to advertise the reader, that the usual\r\nplaces of resort being utterly out of my province or observation, I\r\nshall be obliged frequently to change the dates of places, as\r\noccurrences come into my way. The following letter I lately received\r\nfrom Epsom.[364]\r\n\r\n\r\nEpsom, June 28.\r\n\r\n\"It is now almost three weeks since what you writ about happened in this\r\nplace: the quarrel between my friends did not run so high as I find your\r\naccounts have made it. The truth of the fact you shall have very\r\nfaithfully. You are to understand, that the persons concerned in this\r\nscene were, Lady Autumn, and Lady Springly:[365] Autumn is a person of\r\ngood breeding, formality, and a singular way practised in the last age;\r\nand Lady Springly, a modern impertinent of our sex, who affects as\r\nimproper familiarity, as the other does distance. Lady Autumn knows to a\r\nhair's-breadth where her place is in all assemblies and conversations;\r\nbut Springly neither gives nor takes place of anybody, but understands\r\nthe place to signify no more, than to have room enough to be at ease\r\nwherever she comes. Thus while Autumn takes the whole of this life to\r\nconsist in understanding punctilio and decorum, Springly takes\r\neverything to be becoming which contributes to her ease and\r\nsatisfaction. These heroines have married two brothers, both knights.\r\nSpringly is the spouse of the elder, who is a baronet; and Autumn, being\r\na rich widow, has taken the younger, and her purse endowed him with an\r\nequal fortune and knighthood of the same order. This jumble of titles,\r\nyou need not doubt, has been an aching torment to Autumn, who took place\r\nof the other on no pretence, but her carelessness and disregard of\r\ndistinction. This secret occasion of envy broiled long in the breast of\r\nAutumn; but no opportunity of contention on that subject happening, kept\r\nall things quiet till the accident, of which you demand an account.\r\n\r\n\"It was given out among all the gay people of this place, that on the\r\n9th instant several damsels, swift of foot, were to run for a suit of\r\nhead-clothes at the Old Wells. Lady Autumn on this occasion invited\r\nSpringly to go with her in her coach to see the race. When they came to\r\nthe place where the governor of Epsom and all his court of citizens were\r\nassembled, as well as a crowd of people of all orders, a brisk young\r\nfellow addresses himself to the younger of the ladies, viz., Springly,\r\nand offers her his service to conduct her into the music-room. Springly\r\naccepts the compliment, and is led triumphantly through the bowing\r\ncrowd, while Autumn is left among the rabble, and has much ado to get\r\nback into her coach; but she did it at last: and as it is usual to see\r\nby the horses my lady's present disposition, she orders John to whip\r\nfuriously home to her husband; where, when she enters, down she sits,\r\nbegan to unpin her hood, and lament her foolish fond heart to marry into\r\na family where she was so little regarded, she that might--Here she\r\nstops; then rises up and stamps, and sits down again. Her gentle knight\r\nmade his approaches with a supple beseeching gesture. 'My dear,' said\r\nhe--'Tell me no dears,' replied Autumn; in the presence of the governor\r\nand all the merchants; 'What will the world say of a woman that has\r\nthrown herself away at this rate?' Sir Thomas withdrew, and knew it\r\nwould not be long a secret to him; as well as that experience told him,\r\nhe that marries a fortune, is of course guilty of all faults against his\r\nwife, let them be committed by whom they will. But Springly, an hour or\r\ntwo after, returns from the Wells, and finds the whole company together.\r\nDown she sat, and a profound silence ensued. You know a premeditated\r\nquarrel usually begins and works up with the words, 'Some people.' The\r\nsilence was broken by Lady Autumn, who began to say, 'There are some\r\npeople who fancy, that if some people--' Springly immediately takes her\r\nup; 'There are some people who fancy, if other people--' Autumn\r\nrepartees, 'People may give themselves airs; but other people, perhaps,\r\nwho make less ado, may be, perhaps, as agreeable as people who set\r\nthemselves out more.' All the other people at the table sat mute, while\r\nthese two people, who were quarrelling, went on with the use of the word\r\n'people,' instancing the very accidents between them, as if they kept\r\nonly in distant hints. 'Therefore,' says Autumn, reddening, 'there are\r\nsome people who will go abroad in other people's coaches, and leave\r\nthose, with whom they went, to shift for themselves; and if, perhaps,\r\nthose people have married the younger brother, yet, perhaps, he may be\r\nbeholden to those people for what he is.' Springly smartly answers,\r\n'People may bring so much ill humour into a family, as people may repent\r\ntheir receiving their money'; and goes on--'Everybody is not\r\nconsiderable enough to give her uneasiness.' Upon this, Autumn comes up\r\nto her, and desired her to kiss her, and never to see her again; which\r\nher sister refusing, my lady gave her a box on the ear. Springly\r\nreturns; 'Ay, ay,' said she, 'I knew well enough you meant me by your\r\n\"some people,\"' and gives her another on the other side. To it they went\r\nwith most masculine fury: each husband ran in. The wives immediately\r\nfell upon their husbands, and tore periwigs and cravats. The company\r\ninterposed; when (according to the slip-knot of matrimony, which makes\r\nthem return to one another when any put in between) the ladies and their\r\nhusbands fell upon all the rest of the company; and having beat all\r\ntheir friends and relations out of the house, came to themselves time\r\nenough to know, there was no bearing the jest of the place after these\r\nadventures, and therefore marched off the next day. It is said, the\r\ngovernor has sent several joints of mutton, and has proposed divers\r\ndishes very exquisitely dressed, to bring them down again. From his\r\naddress and knowledge in roast and boiled, all our hopes of the return\r\nof this good company depend. I am,\r\n\r\n\"Dear Jenny,\r\n\r\n\"Your ready Friend\r\n\r\n\"And Servant,\r\n\r\n                                        \"MARTHA TATLER.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWhite's Chocolate-house, June 30.\r\n\r\nThis day appeared here a figure of a person, whose services to the fair\r\nsex have reduced him to a kind of existence, for which there is no name.\r\nIf there be a condition between life and death, without being absolutely\r\ndead or living, his state is that. His aspect and complexion in his\r\nrobust days gave him the illustrious title of Africanus:[366] but it is\r\nnot only from the warm climates in which he has served, nor from the\r\ndisasters which he has suffered, that he deserves the same appellation\r\nwith that renowned Roman; but the magnanimity with which he appears in\r\nhis last moments, is what gives him the undoubted character of Hero.\r\nCato stabbed himself, and Hannibal drank poison; but our Africanus lives\r\nin the continual puncture of aching bones and poisoned juices. The old\r\nheroes fled from torments by death, and this modern lives in death and\r\ntorments, with a heart wholly bent upon a supply for remaining in them.\r\nAn ordinary spirit would sink under his oppressions; but he makes an\r\nadvantage of his very sorrow, and raises an income from his diseases.\r\nLong has this worthy been conversant in bartering, and knows, that when\r\nstocks are lowest, it is the time to buy. Therefore, with much prudence\r\nand tranquillity, he thinks, that now he has not a bone sound, but a\r\nthousand nodous parts for which the anatomists have not words, and more\r\ndiseases than the College ever heard of, it is the only time to purchase\r\nan annuity for life. Sir Thomas[367] told me, it was an entertainment\r\nmore surprising and pleasant than can be imagined, to see an inhabitant\r\nof neither world without hand to lift, or leg to move, scarce tongue to\r\nutter his meaning, so keen upon biting the whole world, and making\r\nbubbles at his exit. Sir Thomas added, that he would have bought twelve\r\nshillings a year of him, but that he feared there was some trick in it,\r\nand believed him already dead: \"What!\" says that knight, \"is Mr.\r\nPartridge, whom I met just now going on both his legs firmer than I can,\r\nallowed to be quite dead; and shall Africanus, without one limb that can\r\ndo its office, be pronounced alive?\" What heightened the tragi-comedy of\r\nthis market for annuities was, that the observation of it provoked\r\nMonoculus[368] (who is the most eloquent of all men) to many excellent\r\nreflections, which he spoke with the vehemence and language both of a\r\ngamester and an orator. \"When I cast,\" said that delightful speaker, \"my\r\neye upon thee, thou unaccountable Africanus, I cannot but call myself as\r\nunaccountable as thou art; for certainly we were born to show what\r\ncontradictions nature is pleased to form in the same species. Here am I,\r\nable to eat, to drink, to sleep, and do all acts of nature, except\r\nbegetting my like; and yet by an unintelligible force of spleen and\r\nfancy, I every moment imagine I am dying. It is utter madness in thee to\r\nprovide for supper; for I'll bet you ten to one, you don't live till\r\nhalf an hour after four; and yet I am so distracted as to be in fear\r\nevery moment, though I'll lay ten to three, I drink three pints of burnt\r\nclaret at your funeral three nights hence. After all, I envy thee; thou\r\nwho dying hast no sense of death, art happier than one in health\r\nthat[369] always fears it.\" The knight had gone on, but that a third man\r\nended the scene by applauding the knight's eloquence and philosophy, in\r\na laughter too violent for his own constitution, as much as he mocked\r\nthat of Africanus and Monoculus.\r\n\r\n\r\nSt. James's Coffee-house, July 1.\r\n\r\nThis day arrived three mails from Holland, with advices relating to the\r\nposture of affairs in the Low Countries, which say, that the Confederate\r\narmy extends from Luchin, on the causeway between Tournay and Lisle, to\r\nEpain near Mortagne on the Scheldt. The Marshal Villars remains in his\r\ncamp at Lens; but it is said, he detached ten thousand men under the\r\ncommand of the Chevalier de Luxembourg, with orders to form a camp at\r\nCrepin on the Haine, between Condé and St. Guillain, where he is to be\r\njoined by the Elector of Bavaria with a body of troops, and after their\r\nconjunction, to attempt to march into Brabant. But they write from\r\nBrussels, that the Duke of Marlborough having it equally in his power to\r\nmake detachments to the same parts, they are under no apprehensions from\r\nthese reports for the safety of their country. They further add from\r\nBrussels, that they have good authority for believing that the French\r\ntroops under the conduct of Marshal de Bezons are retiring out of\r\nSpain.[370]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 363: Nichols argued that this and the two following numbers\r\nwere by Addison. (1) At the end of No. 37 there is a list of errata for\r\nthe preceding number. It was Addison's frequent practice to make verbal\r\nalterations in a preceding paper, and this Steele never did, except in\r\nrare cases, or where there was a positive mistake. (2) All the three\r\npapers are _superscribed_, as Addison's often were, and appear upon the\r\nface of them, to be of the nature, and in the number of those, for which\r\nSteele stood sponsor, and was very patiently traduced and calumniated,\r\nas he acknowledges to Congreve, in the Dedication prefixed to \"The\r\nDrummer.\" There is nothing in the style or manner of any of the three\r\nthat appears incongruous with such a supposition; and the nature of\r\ntheir principal contents seems to support it. They consist chiefly of\r\npleasantries and oblique strokes, apparently on persons of fashion, in\r\nthat age, of both sexes. It appears from the Dedication to \"The\r\nDrummer,\" that Steele had Addison's direct injunctions to hide papers\r\nwhich he never did declare to be Addison's. The case, in short, seems to\r\nbe, that as, as Steele says, there are communications in the course of\r\nthis work, which Addison's modesty, so there are likewise others, which\r\nAddison's prudence, \"would never have admitted to come into daylight,\r\nbut under such a shelter.\" According to the usual rule where there is\r\nuncertainty, Steele's name is placed at the head of the papers in this\r\nedition. Probably he was responsible in any case for part of the\r\ncontents of each of these numbers.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 364: Epsom was frequented for its mineral waters, and was also\r\na favourite holiday resort. \"At the Crown Coffee-house, behind the Royal\r\nExchange, fresh Epsom water, with the rest of the purging waters, at 2d.\r\nper quart, and sold both winter and summer, and Epsom salt.\" (See\r\n\"British Apollo,\" vol. iii.

But though I do not go to\r\nthese public haunts, I receive visits from those who do; and for all\r\nthey pretend so much to the contrary, they are as talkative as our sex,\r\nand as much at a loss to entertain the present company, without\r\nsacrificing the last, as we ourselves. This reflection has led me into\r\nthe consideration of the use of speech; and made me look over in my\r\nmemory all my acquaintance of both sexes, to know to which I may more\r\njustly impute the sin of superfluous discourse, with regard to\r\nconversation, and not entering into it as it respects religion. I\r\nforesee my acquaintance will immediately, upon starting this subject,\r\nask me, how I shall celebrate Mrs. Alse Copswood,[373] the Yorkshire\r\nhuntress, who is come to town lately, and moves as if she were on her\r\nnag, and going to take a five-bar gate; and is as loud as if she were\r\nfollowing her dogs. I can easily answer that; for she is as soft as\r\nDamon, in comparison of her brother-in-law Tom Bellfrey,[374] who is the\r\nmost accomplished man in this kingdom for all gentlemanlike activities\r\nand accomplishments. It is allowed, that he is a professed enemy to the\r\nItalian performers in music. But then for our own native manner,\r\naccording to the customs and known usages of our island, he is to be\r\npreferred, for the generality of the pleasure he bestows, much above\r\nthose fellows,[375] though they sing to full theatres. For what is a\r\ntheatrical voice to that of a fox-hunter? I have been at a musical\r\nentertainment in an open field, where it amazed me to hear to what\r\npitches the chief masters would reach. There was a meeting near our seat\r\nin Staffordshire, and the most eminent of all the counties of England\r\nwere at it. How wonderful was the harmony between men and dogs! Robin\r\nCartail of Bucks was to answer to Jowler; Mr. Tinbreast of Cornwall was\r\nappointed to open with Sweetlips, and Beau Slimber, a Londoner,\r\nundertook to keep up with Trips, a whelp just set in: Tom Bellfrey and\r\nRingwood were coupled together, to fill the cry on all occasions, and be\r\nin at the death of the fox, hare, or stag; for which both the dog and\r\nthe man were excellently suited, and loved one another, and were as much\r\ntogether as Banister and King. When Jowler first alarmed the field,\r\nCartail repeated every note; Sweetlips' treble succeeded, and shook the\r\nwood; Tinbreast echoed a quarter of a mile beyond it. We were soon after\r\nall at a loss, till we rid up, and found Trips and Slimber at a default\r\nin half-notes: but the day and the tune was recovered by Tom Bellfrey\r\nand Ringwood, to the great joy of us all, though they drowned every\r\nother voice: for Bellfrey carries a note four furlongs, three rood, and\r\nsix paces, farther than any other in England. But I fear the mention of\r\nthis will be thought a digression from my purpose about speech: but I\r\nanswer, No. Since this is used where speech rather should be employed,\r\nit may come into consideration in the same chapter: for Mr. Bellfrey\r\nbeing at a visit where I was, viz., his cousin's (Lady Dainty's) in\r\nSoho, was asked, what entertainments they had in the country? Now\r\nBellfrey is very ignorant, and much a clown; but confident withal. In a\r\nword, he struck up a fox-chase: Lady Dainty's dog, Mr. Sippet, as she\r\ncalls him, started and jumped out of his lady's lap, and fell a barking.\r\nBellfrey went on, and called all the neighbouring parishes into the\r\nsquare. Never was woman in such confusion as that delicate lady. But\r\nthere was no stopping her kinsman. A room full of ladies fell into the\r\nmost violent laughter: my lady looked as if she was shrieking; Mr.\r\nSippet in the middle of the room, breaking his heart with barking, but\r\nall of us unheard. As soon as Bellfrey became silent, up gets my lady,\r\nand takes him by the arm to lead him off: Bellfrey was in his boots. As\r\nshe was hurrying him away, his spurs takes hold of her petticoat; his\r\nwhip throws down a cabinet of china: he cries, \"What! are your crocks\r\nrotten? Are your petticoats ragged? A man can't walk in your house for\r\ntrincums.\" Every county of Great Britain has one hundred or more of this\r\nsort of fellows, who roar instead of speaking. Therefore if it be true,\r\nthat we women are also given to greater fluency of words than is\r\nnecessary, sure one that disturbs but a room or a family is more to be\r\ntolerated, than one who draws together parishes and counties, and\r\nsometimes (with an estate that might make him the blessing and ornament\r\nof the world around him) has no other view and ambition, but to be an\r\nanimal above dogs and horses, without the relish of any one enjoyment,\r\nwhich is peculiar to the faculties of human nature. But I know it will\r\nhere be said, that talking of mere country squires at this rate, is, as\r\nit were, to write against Valentine or Orson. To prove anything against\r\nthe race of men, you must take them as they are adorned with education,\r\nas they live in Courts, or have received instructions in colleges.\r\n\r\nBut I was so full of my late entertainment by Mr. Bellfrey, that I must\r\ndefer pursuing this subject to another day; and waive the proper\r\nobservations upon the different offenders in this kind, some by profound\r\neloquence, on small occasions, others by degrading speech upon great\r\ncircumstances. Expect therefore to hear of the whisperer without\r\nbusiness, the laugher without wit, the complainer without receiving\r\ninjuries, and a very large crowd, which I shall not forestall, who are\r\ncommon (though not commonly observed) impertinents, whose tongues are\r\ntoo voluble for their brains, and are the general despisers of us women,\r\nthough we have their superiors, the men of sense, for our servants.[376]\r\n\r\n\r\nSt. James's Coffee-house, July 4.\r\n\r\nThere has arrived no mail since our last; so that we have no manner of\r\nforeign news, except we were to give you, for such, the many\r\nspeculations which are on foot concerning what was imported by the last\r\nadvices. There are, it seems, sixty battalions and seventeen squadrons\r\nappointed to serve in the siege of Tournay; the garrison of which place\r\nconsists but of eleven battalions and four squadrons. Letters of the\r\n29th of the last month from Berlin have brought advice, that the Kings\r\nof Denmark, Prussia, and his Majesty Augustus, were within few days to\r\ncome to an interview at Potsdam. These letters mention, that two Polish\r\nprinces of the family of the Sapicha and Lubermirsky, lately arrived\r\nfrom Paris, confirm the reports of the misery in France for want of\r\nprovisions, and give a particular instance of it, which is, that on the\r\nday Monsieur Rouillé returned to Court, the common people gathered in\r\ncrowds about the Dauphin's coach, crying, \"Peace and bread, bread and\r\npeace.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Distaff has taken upon her, while she writes this paper, to turn\r\nher thoughts wholly to the service of her own sex, and to propose\r\nremedies against the greatest vexations attending female life. She has\r\nfor this end written a small treatise concerning the second word, with\r\nan appendix on the use of a reply, very useful to all such as are\r\nmarried to persons either ill-bred or ill-natured.

He began his discourse about his play\r\nwith a preface.\r\n\r\n\"There is,\" said he, \"somewhat (however we palliate it) in the very\r\nframe and make of us, that subjects our minds to chagrin and\r\nirresolution on any emergency of time or place. The difficulty grows on\r\nour sickened imagination, under all the killing circumstances of danger\r\nand disappointment. This we see, not only in the men of retirement and\r\nfancy, but in the characters of the men of action; with this only\r\ndifference, the coward sees the danger, and sickens under it; the hero,\r\nwarmed by the difficulty, dilates, and rises in proportion to that, and\r\nin some sort makes use of his very fears to disarm it. A remarkable\r\ninstance of this we have in the great Cæsar, when he came to the\r\nRubicon, and was entering upon a part, perhaps, the most hazardous he\r\never bore (certainly the most ungrateful), a war with his countrymen.\r\nWhen his mind brooded over personal affronts, perhaps his anger burned\r\nwith a desire of revenge. But when more serious reflections laid before\r\nhim the hazard of the enterprise, with the dismal consequences which\r\nwere likely to attend it, aggravated by a special circumstance, What\r\nfigure it would bear in the world, or how be excused to posterity. What\r\nshall he do?--His honour, which was his religion, bids him arm; and he\r\nsounds the inclinations of his party, by this set speech:\r\n\r\n#_CÆSAR_ to his Party at the Rubicon.#\r\n\r\n    Great Jove, attend, and thou my native soil,\r\n    Safe in my triumphs, glutted in my spoil;\r\n    Witness with what reluctance I oppose\r\n    My arms to thine, secure of other foes.\r\n    What passive breast can bear disgrace like mine?\r\n    Traitor!--For this I conquered on the Rhine,\r\n    Endured their ten years' drudgery in Gaul,\r\n    Adjourned their fate, and saved the Capitol.\r\n    I grew by every guilty triumph less;\r\n    The crowd, when drunk with joy, their souls express,\r\n    Impatient of the war, yet fear success.\r\n    Brave actions dazzle with too bright a ray,\r\n    Like birds obscene they chatter at the day;\r\n    Giddy with rule, and valiant in debate,\r\n    They throw the die of war, to save the state;\r\n    And gods! to gild ingratitude with fame,\r\n    Assume the patriot's, we the rebel's name.\r\n    Farewell, my friends, your general forlorn,\r\n    To your bare pity, and the public scorn,\r\n    Must lay that honour and his laurel down,\r\n    To serve the vain caprices of the gown;\r\n    Exposed to all indignities, the brave\r\n    Deserve of those they gloried but to save,\r\n    To rods and axes!--No, the slaves can't dare\r\n    Play with my grief, and tempt my last despair.\r\n    This shall the honours which it won maintain,\r\n    Or do me justice, ere I hug my chain.\"\r\n\r\nThe reason for cancelling this article when these papers were\r\nrepublished in octavo, is obvious; for, being printed by Steele, it\r\nwould naturally be applied to the circumstances in which the Duke of\r\nMarlborough was at that time: \"The Duke having his commission under the\r\nGreat Seal, the order of the Queen was not sufficient to dissolve his\r\npower. His friends advised him to assemble, by his authority as general,\r\nall the troops in London, in the different squares, and to take\r\npossession of St. James's, and the person of the Queen. Oxford, apprised\r\nof this design, suddenly called together the Cabinet Council. Though he\r\nprobably concealed his intelligence to prevent their fears, he told them\r\nof the necessity of superseding Marlborough under the Great Seal. This\r\nbusiness was soon despatched. His dismission in form was sent to the\r\nDuke. The Earl of Oxford, no stranger to the character of Marlborough,\r\nknew that he would not act against law, by assembling the troops. The\r\nnatural diffidence of his disposition had made him unfit for enterprises\r\nof danger, in a degree that furnished his enemies with insinuations\r\nagainst his personal courage.\"--(Macpherson's \"State Papers,\" quoted by\r\nNichols.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 38.

However, having sold the 'bear,' and words arising about the\r\ndelivery, the most noble major, no less scorning to be outwitted in the\r\ncoffee-house, than to run into the field, according to method, abused\r\nthe other with the titles of, 'rogue,' 'villain,' 'bearskin-man,' and\r\nthe like. Whereupon satisfaction was demanded, and accepted: so, forth\r\nthe major marched, commanding his adversary to follow. To a most\r\nspacious room in the sheriff's house, near the place of quarrel, they\r\ncome; where, having due regard to what you have lately published, they\r\nresolved not to shed one another's blood in that barbarous manner you\r\nprohibited; yet, not willing to put up affronts without satisfaction,\r\nthey stripped, and in decent manner fought full fairly with their\r\nwrathful hands. The combat lasted a quarter of an hour; in which time\r\nvictory was often doubtful, and many a dry blow was strenuously laid on\r\nby each side, till the major finding his adversary obstinate, unwilling\r\nto give him further chastisement, with most shrill voice cried out, 'I\r\nam satisfied, enough.' Whereupon the combat ceased, and both were\r\nfriends immediately.\r\n\r\n\"Thus the world may see, how necessary it is to encourage those men who\r\nmake it their business to instruct the people in everything necessary\r\nfor their preservation. I am informed, a body of worthy citizens have\r\nagreed on an address of thanks to you for what you have writ on the\r\nforegoing subject, whereby they acknowledge one of their highly esteemed\r\nofficers preserved from death.\r\n\r\n\"Your humble Servant,\r\n\r\n                                        \"A.

I have writ to my\r\nbrother to hasten to town; and hope, that printing the letters directed\r\nto him, which I knew not how to answer, will bring him speedily; and\r\ntherefore I add also the following:\r\n\r\n                                        \"_July 5_, 1709.\r\n\r\n\"MR. BICKERSTAFF,\r\n\r\nYou having hinted a generous intention of taking under your\r\nconsideration the whisperers without business, and laughers without\r\noccasion; as you tender the welfare of your country, I entreat you not\r\nto forget or delay so public-spirited a work. Now or never is the time.\r\nMany other calamities may cease with the war; but I dismally dread the\r\nmultiplication of these mortals under the ease and luxuriousness of a\r\nsettled peace, half the blessing of which may be destroyed by them.\r\nTheir mistake lies certainly here, in a wretched belief, that their\r\nmimicry passes for real business, or true wit. Dear sir, convince them,\r\nthat it never was, is, or ever will be, either of them; nor ever did,\r\ndoes, or to all futurity ever can, look like either of them; but that it\r\nis the most cursed disturbance in nature, which is possible to be\r\ninflicted on mankind, under the noble definition of a sociable creature.\r\nIn doing this, sir, you will oblige more humble servants than can find\r\nroom to subscribe their names.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWhite's Chocolate-house, July 6.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of my last date from hence, I am to proceed on the accounts\r\nI promised of several personages among the men, whose conspicuous\r\nfortunes, or ambition in showing their follies, have exalted them above\r\ntheir fellows: the levity of their minds is visible in their every word\r\nand gesture, and there is not a day passes but puts me in mind of Mr.\r\nWycherley's character of a coxcomb: \"He is ugly all over with the\r\naffectation of the fine gentleman.\" Now though the women may put on\r\nsoftness in their looks, or affected severity, or impertinent gaiety, or\r\npert smartness, their self-love and admiration cannot, under any of\r\nthese disguises, appear so invincible as that of the men. You may easily\r\ntake notice, that in all their actions there is a secret approbation,\r\neither in the tone of their voice, the turn of their body, or cast of\r\ntheir eye, which shows that they are extremely in their own favour. Take\r\none of your men of business, he shall keep you half an hour with your\r\nhat off, entertaining you with his consideration of that affair you\r\nspoke of to him last, till he has drawn a crowd that observes you in\r\nthis grimace. Then when he is public enough, he immediately runs into\r\nsecrets, and falls a whispering. You and he make breaks with adverbs;\r\nas, \"But however, thus far\"; and then you whisper again, and so on, till\r\nthey who are about you are dispersed, and your busy man's vanity is no\r\nlonger gratified by the notice taken of what importance he is, and how\r\ninconsiderable you are; for your pretender to business is never in\r\nsecret, but in public. There is my dear Lord Nowhere, of all men the\r\nmost gracious and most obliging, the terror of all _valets-de-chambre_,\r\nwhom he oppresses with good breeding, in inquiring for my good lord, and\r\nfor my good lady's health. This inimitable courtier will whisper a privy\r\ncouncillor's lackey with the utmost goodness and condescension, to know\r\nwhen they next sit; and is thoroughly taken up, and thinks he has a part\r\nin a secret, if he knows that there is a secret. \"What it is,\" he will\r\nwhisper you, \"that time will discover\"; then he shrugs, and calls you\r\nback again--\"Sir, I need not say to you, that these things are not to be\r\nspoken of--and hark you, no names, I would not be quoted.\" What adds to\r\nthe jest is, that his emptiness has its moods and seasons, and he will\r\nnot condescend to let you into these his discoveries, except he is in\r\nvery good humour, or has seen somebody in fashion talk to you. He will\r\nkeep his nothing to himself, and pass by and overlook as well as the\r\nbest of them; not observing that he is insolent when he is gracious, and\r\nobliging when he is haughty. Show me a woman so inconsiderable as this\r\nfrequent character. But my mind (now I am in) turns to many no less\r\nobservable: thou dear Will Shoestring![380] I profess myself in love\r\nwith thee: how shall I speak thee? How shall I address thee? How shall I\r\ndraw thee? Thou dear outside! Will you be combing your wig,[381] playing\r\nwith your box, or picking your teeth? Or choosest thou rather to be\r\nspeaking; to be speaking for thy only purpose in speaking, to show your\r\nteeth? Rub them no longer, dear Shoestring: do not premeditate murder:\r\ndo not for ever whiten: Oh! that for my quiet and his own they were\r\nrotten. But I will forget him, and give my hand to the courteous Umbra;\r\nhe is a fine man indeed, but the soft creature bows below my\r\napron-string before he takes it; but after the first ceremonies, he is\r\nas familiar as my physician, and his insignificancy makes me half ready\r\nto complain to him of all I would to my doctor. But he is so courteous,\r\nthat he carries half the messages of ladies' ails in town to their\r\nmidwives and nurses. He understands too the art of medicine as far as to\r\nthe cure of a pimple or a rash. On occasions of the like importance, he\r\nis the most assiduous of all men living, in consulting and searching\r\nprecedents from family to family; and then he speaks of his\r\nobsequiousness and diligence in the style of real services. If you sneer\r\nat him, and thank him for his great friendship, he bows, and says,\r\n\"Madam, all the good offices in my power, while I have any knowledge or\r\ncredit, shall be at your service.\" The consideration of so shallow a\r\nbeing, and the intent application with which he pursues trifles, has\r\nmade me carefully reflect upon that sort of men we usually call an\r\nImpertinent: and I am, upon mature deliberation, so far from being\r\noffended with him, that I am really obliged to him; for though he will\r\ntake you aside, and talk half an hour to you upon matters wholly\r\ninsignificant with the most solemn air, yet I consider, that these\r\nthings are of weight in his imagination, and he thinks he is\r\ncommunicating what is for my service. If therefore it be a just rule to\r\njudge of a man by his intention, according to the equity of good\r\nbreeding, he that is impertinently kind or wise, to do you service,\r\nought in return to have a proportionable place both in your affection\r\nand esteem; so that the courteous Umbra deserves the favour of all his\r\nacquaintance; for though he never served them, he is ever willing to do\r\nit, and believes he does it. But as impotent kindness is to be returned\r\nwith all our abilities to oblige, so impotent malice is to be treated\r\nwith all our force to depress it. For this reason Flyblow (who is\r\nreceived in all the families in town through the degeneracy and iniquity\r\nof their manners) is to be treated like a knave, though he is one of the\r\nweakest of fools: he has by rote, and at second-hand, all that can be\r\nsaid of any man of figure, wit, and virtue in town. Name a man of worth,\r\nand this creature tells you the worst passage of his life. Speak of a\r\nbeautiful woman, and this puppy will whisper the next man to him, though\r\nhe has nothing to say of her. He is a Fly that feeds on the sore part,\r\nand would have nothing to live on, if the whole body were in health. You\r\nmay know him by the frequency of pronouncing the particle \"but\"; for\r\nwhich reason I never hear him spoke of with common charity, without\r\nusing my \"but\" against him: for a friend of mine saying the other day,\r\nMrs. Distaff has wit, good humour, virtue, and friendship, this oaf\r\nadded, \"'But' she is not handsome.\" Coxcomb! The gentleman was saying\r\nwhat I was, not what I was not.\r\n\r\n\r\nSt. James's Coffee-house, July 6.\r\n\r\nThe approaches before Tournay have been carried on with great success;\r\nand our advices from the camp before that place of the 11th instant say,\r\nthat they had already made a lodgment on the glacis. Two hundred boats\r\nwere come up the Scheldt with a heavy artillery and ammunition, which\r\nwould be employed in dismounting the enemy's defences, and raised on the\r\nbatteries the 15th. A great body of miners are summoned to the camp to\r\ncountermine the works of the enemy. We are convinced of the weakness of\r\nthe garrison, by a certain account, that they called a council of war,\r\nto consult whether it was not advisable to march into the citadel, and\r\nleave the town defenceless. We are assured, that when the Confederate\r\narmy was advancing towards the camp of Marshal Villars, that general\r\ndespatched a courier to his master with a letter, giving an account of\r\ntheir approach, which concluded with the following words: \"The day\r\nbegins to break, and your Majesty's army is already in order of battle.\r\nBefore noon, I hope to have the honour of congratulating your Majesty on\r\nthe success of a great action; and you shall be very well satisfied with\r\nthe Marshal Villars.\"\r\n\r\nIt is to be noted, that when any part of this paper appears dull, there\r\nis a design in it.[382]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 377: See note to No. 36.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 378: A coffee-house in Change Alley.

[STEELE.\r\n\r\nBy ISAAC BICKERSTAFF, Esq.\r\n\r\nFrom _Thursday, July 7_, to _Saturday, July 9_, 1709.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nGrecian Coffee-house, July 7.\r\n\r\nAs I am called forth by the immense love I bear to my fellow creatures,\r\nand the warm inclination I feel within me, to stem, as far as I can, the\r\nprevailing torrent of vice and ignorance; so I cannot more properly\r\npursue that noble impulse, than by setting forth the excellence of\r\nvirtue and knowledge in their native and beautiful colours. For this\r\nreason I made my late excursion to Oxford, where those qualities appear\r\nin their highest lustre, and are the only pretences to honour and\r\ndistinction: superiority is there given in proportion to men's\r\nadvancement in wisdom and learning; and that just rule of life is so\r\nuniversally received among those happy people, that you shall see an\r\nearl walk bareheaded to the son of the meanest artificer, in respect to\r\nseven years more worth and knowledge than the nobleman is possessed of.\r\nIn other places they bow to men's fortunes, but here to their\r\nunderstandings. It is not to be expressed, how pleasing the order, the\r\ndiscipline, the regularity of their lives, is to a philosopher, who has,\r\nby many years' experience in the world, learned to contemn everything\r\nbut what is revered in this mansion of select and well-taught spirits.\r\nThe magnificence of their palaces, the greatness of their revenues, the\r\nsweetness of their groves and retirements, seem equally adapted for the\r\nresidence of princes and philosophers; and a familiarity with objects of\r\nsplendour, as well as places of recess, prepares the inhabitants with an\r\nequanimity for their future fortunes, whether humble or illustrious. How\r\nwas I pleased when I looked round at St. Mary's, and could, in the faces\r\nof the ingenious youth, see ministers of state, chancellors, bishops,\r\nand judges. Here only is human life! Here only the life of man is a\r\nrational being! Here men understand and are employed in works worthy\r\ntheir noble nature. This transitory being passes away in an employment\r\nnot unworthy a future state, the contemplation of the great decrees of\r\nProvidence. Each man lives as if he were to answer the questions made to\r\nJob, \"Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth?... Who\r\nshut up the sea with doors, ... and said, Hitherto shalt thou come, and\r\nno further?\"[383] Such speculations make life agreeable, make death\r\nwelcome, But alas! I was torn from this noble society by the business of\r\nthis dirty mean world, and the cares of fortune: for I was obliged to be\r\nin town against the 7th day of the term, and accordingly governed myself\r\nby my Oxford Almanack, and came last night; but find, to my great\r\nastonishment, that this ignorant town began the term on the 24th of the\r\nlast month, in opposition to all the learning and astronomy of the\r\nfamous university of which I have been speaking; according to which, the\r\nterm certainly was to commence on the 1st instant.[384] You may be sure,\r\na man who has turned his studies as I have, could not be mistaken in\r\npoint of time; for knowing I was to come to town in term, I examined the\r\npassing moments very narrowly, and called an eminent astronomer to my\r\nassistance. Upon very strict observation we found, that the cold has\r\nbeen so severe this last winter (which is allowed to have a benumbing\r\nquality), that it retarded the earth in moving round from Christmas to\r\nthis season full seven days and two seconds. My learned friend assured\r\nme further, that the earth had lately received a shog from a comet that\r\ncrossed its vortex, which, if it had come ten degrees nearer us, had\r\nmade us lose this whole term. I was indeed once of opinion, that the\r\nGregorian computation was the most regular, as being eleven days before\r\nthe Julian; but am now fully convinced, that we ought to be seven days\r\nafter the chancellor and judges, and eighteen before the Pope of Rome;\r\nand that the Oxonian computation is the best of the three. These are the\r\nreasons which I have gathered from philosophy and nature; to which I can\r\nadd other circumstances in vindication of the account of this learned\r\nbody who published this almanack. It is notorious to philosophers, that\r\njoy and grief can hasten and delay time. Mr. Locke is of opinion, that a\r\nman in great misery may so far lose his measure, as to think a minute an\r\nhour; or in joy, make an hour a minute. Let us examine the present case\r\nby this rule, and we shall find, that the cause of this general mistake\r\nin the British nation, has been the great success of the last campaign,\r\nand the following hopes of peace. Stocks ran so high at the 'Change,\r\nthat the citizens had gained three days of the courtiers; and we have\r\nindeed been so happy this reign, that if the University did not rectify\r\nour mistakes, we should think ourselves but in the second year of her\r\npresent Majesty. It would be endless to enumerate the many damages that\r\nhave happened by this ignorance of the vulgar. All the recognisances\r\nwithin the Diocese of Oxford have been forfeited, for not appearing on\r\nthe first day of this fictitious term. The University has been nonsuited\r\nin their action against the booksellers for printing Clarendon in\r\nquarto. But indeed what gives me the most quick concern, is the case of\r\na poor gentleman my friend, who was the other day taken in execution by\r\na set of ignorant bailiffs. He should, it seems, have pleaded in the\r\nfirst week of term; but being a Master of Arts of Oxford, he would not\r\nrecede from the Oxonian computation. He showed Mr. Broad the almanack,\r\nand the very day when the term began; but the merciless ignorant fellow,\r\nagainst all sense and learning, would hurry him away. He went indeed\r\nquietly enough; but he has taken exact notes of the time of arrest, and\r\nsufficient witnesses of his being carried into gaol; and has, by advice\r\nof the Recorder of Oxford, brought his action; and we doubt not but we\r\nshall pay them off with damages, and blemish the reputation of Mr.\r\nBroad. We have one convincing proof, which all that frequent the Courts\r\nof Justice are witnesses of: the dog that comes constantly to\r\nWestminster on the first day of the term, did not appear till the first\r\nday according to the Oxford Almanack; whose instinct I take to be a\r\nbetter guide than men's erroneous opinions, which are usually biased by\r\ninterest. I judge in this case, as King Charles II. victualled his navy,\r\nwith the bread which one of his dogs chose of several pieces thrown\r\nbefore him, rather than trust to the asseverations of the victuallers.\r\nMr. Cowper,[385] and other learned counsel, have already urged the\r\nauthority of this almanack, in behalf of their clients. We shall\r\ntherefore go on with all speed in our cause; and doubt not, but Chancery\r\nwill give at the end what we lost in the beginning, by protracting the\r\nterm for us till Wednesday come se'nnight: and the University orator\r\nshall for ever pray, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom my own Apartment, July 7.\r\n\r\nThe subject of duels[386] has, I find, been started with so good\r\nsuccess, that it has been the frequent subject of conversation among\r\npolite men; and a dialogue of that kind has been transmitted to me\r\nverbatim, as follows. The persons concerned in it are men of honour, and\r\nexperience in the manners of men, and have fallen upon the truest\r\nfoundation, as well as searched the bottom, of this evil.\r\n\r\nMr. SAGE. If it were in my power, every man that drew his sword, unless\r\nin the Service, or purely to defend his life, person, or goods, from\r\nviolence (I mean abstracted from all punctos or whims of honour) should\r\nride the wooden horse in the Tilt Yard[387] for such first offence, for\r\nthe second stand in the pillory, and for the third be prisoner in Bedlam\r\nfor life.\r\n\r\nCol. PLUME. I remember, that a rencounter or duel was so far from being\r\nin fashion among the officers that served in the Parliament army, that\r\non the contrary, it was as disreputable, and as great an impediment to\r\nadvancement in the Service, as being bashful in time of action.\r\n\r\nSir MARK. Yet I have been informed by some old Cavaliers, of famous\r\nreputation for brave and gallant men, that they were much more in mode\r\namong their party, than they have been during this last war.\r\n\r\nCol. PLUME. That is true too, sir. Mr. SAGE. By what you say,\r\ngentlemen, one should think that our present military officers are\r\ncompounded of an equal proportion of both those tempers; since duels are\r\nneither quite discountenanced, nor much in vogue.\r\n\r\nSir MARK. That difference of temper, in regard to duels, which appears\r\nto have been between the Court and Parliament-men of the sword, was not\r\n(I conceive) for want of courage in the latter, nor of a liberal\r\neducation; because there were some of the best families in England\r\nengaged in that party; but gallantry and mode, which glitter agreeably\r\nto the imagination, were encouraged by the Court, as promoting its\r\nsplendour; and it was as natural that the contrary party (who were to\r\nrecommend themselves to the public for men of serious and solid parts)\r\nshould deviate from everything chimerical.\r\n\r\nMr. SAGE. I have never read of a duel among the Romans; and yet their\r\nnobility used more liberty with their tongues than one may do now\r\nwithout being challenged.\r\n\r\nSir MARK. Perhaps the Romans were of opinion, that ill language, and\r\nbrutal manners, reflected only on those who were guilty of them; and\r\nthat a man's reputation was not at all cleared by cutting the person's\r\nthroat who had reflected upon it: but the custom of those times had\r\nfixed the scandal in the action; whereas now it lies in the reproach.\r\n\r\nMr. SAGE. And yet the only sort of duel that one can conceive to have\r\nbeen fought upon motives truly honourable and allowable, was that\r\nbetween the Horatii and Curiatii.\r\n\r\nSir MARK. Colonel Plume, pray what was the method of single combat in\r\nyour time among the Cavaliers? I suppose, that as the use of clothes\r\ncontinues, though the fashion of them has been mutable; so duels,\r\nthough still in use, have had in all times their particular modes of\r\nperformance.\r\n\r\nCol. PLUME. We had no constant rule, but generally conducted our dispute\r\nand tilt according to the last that had happened between persons of\r\nreputation among the very top fellows for bravery and gallantry.\r\n\r\nSir MARK. If the fashion of quarrelling and tilting was so often changed\r\nin your time, Colonel Plume, a man might fight, yet lose his credit for\r\nwant of understanding the fashion.\r\n\r\nCol. PLUME. Why, Sir Mark, in the beginning of July, a man would have\r\nbeen censured for want of courage, or been thought indigent of the true\r\nnotions of honour, if he had put up [with] words, which in the end of\r\nSeptember following, one could not resent without passing for a brutal\r\nand quarrelsome fellow.\r\n\r\nSir MARK. But, Colonel, were duels or rencounters most in fashion in\r\nthose days?\r\n\r\nCol. PLUME. Your men of nice honour, sir, were for avoiding all censure\r\nof advantage which they supposed might be taken in a rencounter;\r\ntherefore they used seconds, who were to see that all was upon the\r\nsquare, and make a faithful report of the whole combat; but in a little\r\ntime it became a fashion for the seconds to fight, and I'll tell you how\r\nit happened.\r\n\r\nMr. SAGE. Pray do, Colonel Plume, and the method of a duel at that time,\r\nand give us some notion of the punctos upon which your nice men\r\nquarrelled in those days.\r\n\r\nCol. PLUME. I was going to tell you, Mr. Sage, that one Cornet Modish\r\nhad desired his friend, Captain Smart's, opinion in some affair, but did\r\nnot follow it; upon which Captain Smart sent Major Adroit (a very\r\ntopping fellow of those times) to the person that had slighted his\r\nadvice. The Major never inquired into the quarrel, because it was not\r\nthe manner then among the very topping fellows; but got two swords of an\r\nequal length, and then waited upon Cornet Modish, desiring him to choose\r\nhis sword, and meet his friend Captain Smart. Cornet Modish came with\r\nhis friend to the place of combat; there the principals put on their\r\npumps, and stripped to their shirts, to show they had nothing but what\r\nmen of honour carry about them, and then engaged.\r\n\r\nSir MARK. And did the seconds stand by, sir?\r\n\r\nCol. PLUME. It was a received custom till that time; but the swords of\r\nthose days being pretty long, and the principals acting on both sides\r\nupon the defensive, and the morning being frosty, Major Adroit desired\r\nthat the other second, who was also a very topping fellow, would try a\r\nthrust or two only to keep them warm, till the principals had decided\r\nthe matter, which was agreed to by Modish's second, who presently\r\nwhipped Adroit through the body, disarmed him, and then parted the\r\nprincipals, who had received no harm at all.\r\n\r\nMr. SAGE. But was not Adroit laughed at?\r\n\r\nCol. PLUME. On the contrary, the very topping fellows were ever after of\r\nopinion, that no man who deserved that character, could serve as a\r\nsecond, without fighting; and the Smarts and Modishes finding their\r\naccount in it, the humour took without opposition.\r\n\r\nMr. SAGE. Pray, Colonel, how long did that fashion continue?\r\n\r\nCol. PLUME, Not long neither, Mr. Sage; for as soon as it became a\r\nfashion, the very topping fellows thought their honour reflected upon,\r\nif they did not proffer themselves as seconds when any of their friends\r\nhad a quarrel; so that sometimes there were a dozen of a side.\r\n\r\nSir MARK. Bless me! If that custom had continued, we should have been\r\nat a loss now for our very pretty fellows; for they seem to be the\r\nproper men to officer, animate, and keep up an army: but, pray, sir, how\r\ndid that sociable manner of tilting grow out of mode?\r\n\r\nCol. PLUME. Why, sir, I'll tell you; it was a law among the combatants,\r\nthat the party which happened to have the first man disarmed or killed,\r\nshould yield as vanquished; which some people thought might encourage\r\nthe Modishes and Smarts in quarrelling, to the destruction of only the\r\nvery topping fellows; and as soon as this reflection was started, the\r\nvery topping fellows thought it an incumbrance upon their honour to\r\nfight at all themselves. Since that time, the Modishes and the Smarts,\r\nthroughout all Europe, have extolled the French king's edict.\r\n\r\nSir MARK. Our very pretty fellows, whom I take to be the successors of\r\nthe very topping fellows, think a quarrel so little fashionable, that\r\nthey will not be exposed to it by another man's vanity, or want of\r\nsense.\r\n\r\nMr. SAGE. But, Colonel, I have observed in your account of duels, that\r\nthere was a great exactness in avoiding all advantage that might\r\npossibly be between the combatants.\r\n\r\nCol. PLUME. That's true, sir; for the weapons were always equal.\r\n\r\nMr. SAGE. Yes, sir; but suppose an active, adroit, strong man, had\r\ninsulted an awkward, or a feeble, or an unpractised swordsman.\r\n\r\nCol. PLUME. Then, sir, they fought with pistols.\r\n\r\nMr. SAGE. But, sir, there might be a certain advantage that way; for a\r\ngood marksman will be sure to hit his man at twenty yards distance; and\r\na man whose hand shakes (which is common to men that debauch in\r\npleasures, or have not used pistols out of their holsters) won't\r\nventure to fire, unless he touches the person he shoots at. Now, sir, I\r\nam of opinion, that one can get no honour in killing a man (if one has\r\nit all rug,[388] as the gamesters say), when they have a trick to make\r\nthe game secure, though they seem to play upon the square.\r\n\r\nSir MARK. In truth, Mr. Sage, I think such a fact must be murder in a\r\nman's own private conscience, whatever it may appear to the world.\r\n\r\nCol. PLUME. I have known some men so nice, that they would not fight but\r\nupon a cloak without pistols.\r\n\r\nMr. SAGE. I believe a custom, well established, would outdo the Grand\r\nMonarch's edict.[389]\r\n\r\nSir MARK. And bullies would then leave off their long swords; but I\r\ndon't find that a very pretty fellow can stay to change his sword, when\r\nhe is insulted by a bully with a long diego,[390] though his own at the\r\nsame time be no longer than a penknife; which will certainly be the\r\ncase, if such little swords are in mode. Pray, Colonel, how was it\r\nbetween the hectors of your time and the very topping fellows?\r\n\r\nCol. PLUME. Sir, long swords happened to be generally worn in those\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nMr. SAGE. In answer to what you were saying, Sir Mark, give me leave to\r\ninform you, that your knights-errant (who were the very pretty fellows\r\nof those ancient times) thought they could not honourably yield, though\r\nthey had fought their own trusty weapons to the stumps; but would\r\nventure as boldly with the page's leaden sword, as if it had been of\r\nenchanted metal. Whence I conceive, there must be a spice of romantic\r\ngallantry in the composition of that very pretty fellow.\r\n\r\nSir MARK. I am of opinion, Mr. Sage, that fashion governs a very pretty\r\nfellow; nature, or common sense, your ordinary persons, and sometimes\r\nmen of fine parts.\r\n\r\nMr. SAGE. But what is the reason, that men of the most excellent sense\r\nand morals (in other points) associate their understandings with the\r\nvery pretty fellows in that chimæra of a duel?\r\n\r\nSir MARK. There's no disputing against so great a majority.\r\n\r\nMr. SAGE. But there is one scruple (Colonel Plume) and I have done:\r\ndon't you believe there may be some advantage even upon a cloak with\r\npistols, which a man of nice honour would scruple to take?\r\n\r\nCol. PLUME. Faith, I can't tell, sir; but since one may reasonably\r\nsuppose, that (in such a case) there can be but one so far in the wrong\r\nas to occasion matters to come to that extremity, I think the chance of\r\nbeing killed should fall but on one; whereas by their close and\r\ndesperate manner of fighting, it may very probably happen to both.\r\n\r\nSir MARK. Why, gentlemen, if they are men of such nice honour (and must\r\nfight), there will be no fear of foul play, if they threw up cross or\r\npile[391] who should be shot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 383: Job xxxviii. 4, 8, 11.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 384: There was a difference between the University terms and\r\nthe Law terms.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 385: Spencer Cowper (1669-1727), brother of Earl Cowper, and\r\nafterwards a judge of the Common Pleas.

[STEELE.\r\n\r\nFrom _Saturday, July 9_, to _Tuesday, July 12_, 1709.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nWill's Coffee-house, July 11.\r\n\r\nLetters from the city of London give an account of a very great\r\nconsternation that place is in at present, by reason of a late inquiry\r\nmade at Guildhall, whether a noble person[392] has parts enough to\r\ndeserve the enjoyment of the great estate of which he is possessed. The\r\ncity is apprehensive that this precedent may go further than was at\r\nfirst imagined. The person against whom this inquisition is set up by\r\nhis relations, is a peer of a neighbouring kingdom, and has in his youth\r\nmade some few bulls, by which it is insinuated, that he has forfeited\r\nhis goods and chattels. This is the more astonishing, in that there are\r\nmany persons in the said city who are still more guilty than his\r\nlordship, and who, though they are idiots, do not only possess, but have\r\nalso themselves acquired great estates, contrary to the known laws of\r\nthis realm, which vests their possessions in the Crown. There is a\r\ngentleman of this coffee-house at this time exhibiting a bill in\r\nChancery against his father's younger brother, who by some strange magic\r\nhas arrived at the value of half a plum, as the citizens call a hundred\r\nthousand pounds; and in all the time of growing up to that wealth, was\r\nnever known in any of his ordinary words or actions to discover any\r\nproof of reason. Upon this foundation my friend has set forth, that he\r\nis illegally master of his coffers, and has writ two epigrams to signify\r\nhis own pretensions and sufficiency for spending that estate. He has\r\ninserted in his plea some things which I fear will give offence; for he\r\npretends to argue, that though a man has a little of the knave mixed\r\nwith the fool, he is nevertheless liable to the loss of goods; and makes\r\nthe abuse of reason as just an avoidance of an estate as the total\r\nabsence of it. This is what can never pass; but witty men are so full of\r\nthemselves, that there is no persuading them; and my friend will not be\r\nconvinced, but that upon quoting Solomon, who always used the word\r\n\"fool\" as a term of the same signification with \"unjust,\" and makes all\r\ndeviation from goodness and virtue to come under the notion of folly--I\r\nsay, he doubts not, but by the force of this authority, let his idiot\r\nuncle appear never so great a knave, he shall prove him a fool at the\r\nsame time. This affair led the company here into an examination of these\r\npoints; and none coming here but wits, what was asserted by a young\r\nlawyer, that a lunatic is in the care of the Chancery, but a fool in\r\nthat of the Crown, was received with general indignation. \"Why that?\"\r\nsays old Renault. \"Why that? Why must a fool be a courtier more than a\r\nmadman? This is the iniquity of this dull age: I remember the time when\r\nit went on the mad side; all your top wits were scowrers,[393] rakes,\r\nroarers, and demolishers of windows. I remember a mad lord who was drunk\r\nfive years together, and was the envy of that age, and is faintly\r\nimitated by the dull pretenders to vice and madness in this. Had he\r\nlived to this day, there had not been a fool in fashion in the whole\r\nkingdom.\" When Renault had done speaking, a very worthy man assumed the\r\ndiscourse: \"This is,\" said he, \"Mr. Bickerstaff, a proper argument for\r\nyou to treat in your article from this place; and if you would send your\r\nPacolet into all our brains, you would find, that a little fibre or\r\nvalve, scarce discernible, makes the distinction between a politician\r\nand an idiot. We should therefore throw a veil upon those unhappy\r\ninstances of human nature, who seem to breathe without the direction of\r\nreason and understanding, as we should avert our eyes with abhorrence\r\nfrom such as live in perpetual abuse and contradiction to these noble\r\nfaculties. Shall this unfortunate man be divested of his estate, because\r\nhe is tractable and indolent, runs in no man's debt, invades no man's\r\nbed, nor spends the estate he owes his children and his character; when\r\none who shows no sense above him, but in such practices, shall be\r\nesteemed in his senses, and possibly may pretend to the guardianship of\r\nhim who is no ways his inferior, but in being less wicked? We see old\r\nage brings us indifferently into the same impotence of soul, wherein\r\nnature has placed this lord. There is something very fantastical in the\r\ndistribution of civil power and capacity among men. The law certainly\r\ngives these persons into the ward and care of the Crown, because that is\r\nbest able to protect them from injuries, and the impositions of craft\r\nand knavery; that the life of an idiot may not ruin the entail of a\r\nnoble house, and his weakness may not frustrate the industry or capacity\r\nof the founder of his family. But when one of bright parts, as we say,\r\nwith his eyes open, and all men's eyes upon him, destroys those\r\npurposes, there is no remedy. Folly and ignorance are punished! Folly\r\nand guilt are tolerated! Mr. Locke has somewhere made a distinction\r\nbetween a madman and a fool:[394] a fool is he that from right\r\nprinciples makes a wrong conclusion; but a madman is one who draws a\r\njust inference from false principles. Thus the fool who cut off the\r\nfellow's head that lay asleep, and hid it, and then waited to see what\r\nhe would say when he awakened and missed his headpiece, was in the right\r\nin the first thought, that a man would be surprised to find such an\r\nalteration in things since he fell asleep; but he was a little mistaken\r\nto imagine he could awake at all after his head was off. A madman\r\nfancies himself a prince; but upon his mistake, he acts suitably to that\r\ncharacter; and though he is out in supposing he has principalities,\r\nwhile he drinks gruel, and lies in straw, yet you shall see him keep the\r\nport of a distressed monarch in all his words and actions. These two\r\npersons are equally taken into custody: but what must be done to half\r\nthis good company, who every hour of their life are knowingly and\r\nwittingly both fools and madmen, and yet have capacities both of forming\r\nprinciples, and drawing conclusions, with the full use of reason?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom my own Apartment, July 11.\r\n\r\nThis evening some ladies came to visit my sister Jenny; and the\r\ndiscourse, after very many frivolous and public matters, turned upon the\r\nmain point among the women, the passion of love.[395] Sappho, who always\r\nleads on this occasion, began to show her reading, and told us, that Sir\r\nJohn Suckling and Milton had, upon a parallel occasion, said the\r\ntenderest things she had ever read. \"The circumstance,\" said she, \"is\r\nsuch as gives us a notion of that protecting part which is the duty of\r\nmen in their honourable designs upon, or possession of, women. In\r\nSuckling's tragedy of 'Brennoralt' he makes the lover steal into his\r\nmistress's bedchamber, and draw the curtains; then, when his heart is\r\nfull of her charms, as she lies sleeping, instead of being carried away\r\nby the violence of his desires into thoughts of a warmer nature, sleep,\r\nwhich is the image of death, gives this generous lover reflections of a\r\ndifferent kind, which regard rather her safety than his own passion.\r\nFor, beholding her as she lies sleeping, he utters these words:\r\n\r\n    _\"So misers look upon their gold,\r\n    Which, while they joy to see, they fear to lose:\r\n    The pleasure of the sight scarce equalling\r\n    The jealousy of being dispossessed by others.\r\n    Her face is like the Milky Way i' th' sky,\r\n    A meeting of gentle lights without name!\r\n\r\n    \"Heavens I shall this fresh ornament of the world,\r\n    These precious love-lines, pass with other common things\r\n    Amongst the wastes of time? what pity 'twere!_[396]\r\n\r\n\"When Milton makes Adam leaning on his arm, beholding Eve, and lying in\r\nthe contemplation of her beauty, he describes the utmost tenderness and\r\nguardian affection in one word:\r\n\r\n    \"_Adam with looks of cordial love\r\n    Hung over her enamoured._[397]\r\n\r\n\"This is that sort of passion which truly deserves the name of 'love,'\r\nand has something more generous than friendship itself; for it has a\r\nconstant care of the object beloved, abstracted from its own interests\r\nin the possession of it.\" Sappho was proceeding on the subject, when my\r\nsister produced a letter sent to her in the time of my absence, in\r\ncelebration of the marriage state, which is the condition wherein only\r\nthis sort of passion reigns in full authority. The epistle is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\"DEAR MADAM,\r\n\r\n\"Your brother being absent, I dare take the liberty of writing to you my\r\nthoughts of that state, which our whole sex either is or desires to be\r\nin: you'll easily guess I mean matrimony, which I hear so much decried,\r\nthat it was with no small labour I maintained my ground against two\r\nopponents; but, as your brother observed of Socrates, I drew them into\r\nmy conclusion from their own concessions; thus:\r\n\r\n    _\"In marriage are two happy things allowed,\r\n    A wife in wedding-sheets, and in a shroud.\r\n    How can a marriage state then be accursed,\r\n    Since the last day's as happy as the first?_\r\n\r\n\"If you think they were too easily confuted, you may conclude them not\r\nof the first sense, by their talking against marriage.\r\n\r\n\"Yours,\r\n\r\n                                        \"MARIANA.\"\r\n\r\nI observed Sappho began to redden at this epistle; and turning to a\r\nlady, who was playing with a dog she was so fond of as to carry him\r\nabroad with her; \"Nay,\" says she, \"I cannot blame the men if they have\r\nmean ideas of our souls and affections, and wonder so many are brought\r\nto take us for companions for life, when they see our endearments so\r\ntriflingly placed: for, to my knowledge, Mr. Truman would give half his\r\nestate for half the affection you have shown to that Shock: nor do I\r\nbelieve you would be ashamed to confess, that I saw you cry, when he had\r\nthe colic last week with lapping sour milk. What more could you do for\r\nyour lover himself?\" \"What more!\" replied the lady, \"there is not a man\r\nin England for whom I could lament half so much.\" Then she stifled the\r\nanimal with kisses, and called him, Beau, Life, Dear, Monsieur, Pretty\r\nFellow, and what not, in the hurry of her impertinence. Sappho rose up;\r\nas she always does at anything she observes done, which discovers in her\r\nown sex a levity of mind, which renders them inconsiderable in the\r\nopinion of others.\r\n\r\n\r\nSt. James's Coffee-house, July 11.\r\n\r\nLetters from the Hague of the 16th instant, N.S., say, that the siege of\r\nTournay went on with all imaginable success; and that there has been no\r\nmanner of stop given to the attempts of the Confederates since they\r\nundertook it, except that by an accident of firing a piece of ordnance,\r\nit burst, and killed fifteen or sixteen men. The French army is still\r\nin the camp of Lens, and goes on in improving their entrenchments. When\r\nthe last advices came away, it was believed the town of Tournay would be\r\nin the hands of the Confederates by the end of this month. Advices from\r\nBrussels inform us, that they have an account of a great action between\r\nthe malcontents in the Vivarez, and the French king's forces under the\r\ncommand of the Duke of Roquelaure, in which engagement there were\r\neighteen hundred men killed on the spot. They add, that all sorts of\r\npeople who are under any oppression or discontent do daily join the\r\nVivarois; and that their present body of men in arms consisted of six\r\nthousand. This sudden insurrection has put the Court of France under\r\ngreat difficulties; and the king has given orders, that the main body of\r\nhis troops in Spain shall withdraw into his own dominions, where they\r\nare to be quartered in such countries as have of late discovered an\r\ninclination to take up arms: the calamities of that kingdom being such,\r\nthat the people are not by any means to be kept in obedience, except by\r\nthe terror of military execution. What makes the distresses still\r\ngreater, is, that the Court begins to be doubtful of their troops, some\r\nregiments in the action in the Cevennes having faced about against their\r\nofficers; and after the battle was over, joined the malcontents. Upon\r\nreceiving advice of this battle, the Duke of Berwick detached twelve\r\nbattalions into those parts, and began to add new works to his\r\nentrenchments near Briançon, in order to defend his camp, after being\r\nweakened by sending so great a reinforcement into the Cevennes. Letters\r\nfrom Spain say, that the Duchess of Anjou was lately delivered of a\r\nsecond son. They write from Madrid of the 25th of June, that the\r\nblockade of Olivenza was continued; but acknowledge, that the late\r\nprovisions which were thrown into the place, make them doubt whether\r\nthey shall be masters of it this campaign; though it is at present so\r\nclosely blocked up, that it appears impracticable to send in any more\r\nstores or succours. They are preparing with all expedition to repair the\r\nfortifications of Alicante, for the security of the kingdom of Valencia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 392: It appears from Luttrell's \"Brief Relation,\" that in Feb.\r\n1707, Commissioners sat in the Exchequer Room at Westminster to try\r\nwhether Viscount Wenman, \"aged 19, of £5000 per annum estate in\r\nOxfordshire,\" were an idiot or not. On the 14th February the Commission\r\nwas superseded. In June 1709, a new Commission passed the Great Seal for\r\ninquiring into the Viscount's idiocy, and on July 29 they found that he\r\nwas no idiot. On July 12, Peter Wentworth wrote thus to Lord Raby: \"The\r\nprosecution of Lord Wainman is now order'd again, upon wch the _Tatler_\r\nis to day; the accation I am told is this, that last year when there was\r\na stopt put to't 'twas upon the intercession lady Wainman the mother\r\nmade to the Queen, and that she designed to marry her son, the fool, to\r\nSir John Packington's daughter, 'twas then said that my Lady her self\r\nhad married her Butler, wch the Queen desired her to tell the truth, and\r\nshe did assure the Queen upon her word and honour,'twas false, and she\r\nnever intended any such thing, but of late she has own her marriage to\r\nthat same Butler, and put off the match with Sir John P----daughter, and\r\nmarried him to her husband's sister, wch they say the Queen is angry at\r\nand therefore this fresh prosecution is order'd\" (\"Wentworth Papers,\" p.\r\n93). Lord Wenman, the fifth Viscount, was born in 1687, married\r\nSusannah, daughter of Seymour Wroughton, Esq., in 1709, and died in\r\n1729. Lord Wenman's brother-in-law, Francis Wroughton, was also his\r\nfather-in-law, for he had married, in 1699, as her third husband, the\r\nViscount's mother, the Countess of Abingdon.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 393: The Scowrers and Roarers were the forerunners of the\r\nMohocks of 1712.

This, it seems, is the way of giving out of orders\r\nin the Artillery Company;[398] and they prepare for a day of action with\r\nso little concern, as only to call it, \"An Exercise of Arms.\"\r\n\r\n\"An Exercise at Arms of the Artillery Company, to be performed on\r\nWednesday, June 29, 1709, under the command of Sir Joseph Woolfe, Knight\r\nand Alderman, General; Charles Hopson, Esquire, present Sheriff,\r\nLieutenant-General; Captain Richard Synge, Major; Major John Shorey,\r\nCaptain of Grenadiers; Captain William Grayhurst, Captain John Buttler,\r\nCaptain Robert Carellis, Captains.\r\n\r\n\"The body march from the Artillery Ground through Moorgate, Coleman\r\nStreet, Lothbury, Broad Street, Finch Lane, Cornhill, Cheapside, St.\r\nMartin's, St. Anne's Lane, halt the pikes under the wall in Noble\r\nStreet, draw up the firelocks facing the Goldsmiths' Hall, make ready\r\nand face to the left, and fire, and so ditto three times. Beat to arms,\r\nand march round the hall, as up Lad Lane, Gutter Lane, Honey Lane, and\r\nso wheel to the right, and make your salute to my lord, and so down St.\r\nAnne's Lane, up Aldersgate Street, Barbican, and draw up in Red Cross\r\nStreet, the right at St. Paul's Alley in the rear. March off\r\nLieutenant-General with half the body up Beech Lane: he sends a\r\nsubdivision up King's Head Court, and takes post in it, and marches two\r\ndivisions round into Red Lion Market, to defend that pass, and succour\r\nthe division in King's Head Court, but keeps in White Cross Street,\r\nfacing Beech Lane, the rest of the body ready drawn up. Then the General\r\nmarches up Beech Lane, is attacked, but forces the division in the court\r\ninto the market, and enters with three divisions while he presses the\r\nLieutenant-General's main body; and at the same time, the three\r\ndivisions force those of the revolters out of the market, and so all the\r\nLieutenant-General's body retreats into Chiswell Street, and lodges two\r\ndivisions in Grub Street; and as the General marches on, they fall on\r\nhis flank, but soon made to give way; but having a retreating place in\r\nRed Lion Court, but could not hold it, being put to flight through\r\nPaul's Alley, and pursued by the General's grenadiers, while he marches\r\nup and attacks their main body, but are opposed again by a party of men\r\nas lay in Black Raven Court; but they are forced also to retire soon in\r\nthe utmost confusion; and at the same time those brave divisions in\r\nPaul's Alley ply their rear with grenadiers, that with precipitation\r\nthey take to the rout along Bunhill Row: so the General marches into the\r\nArtillery Ground, and being drawn up, finds the revolting party to have\r\nfound entrance, and makes a show as if for a battle, and both armies\r\nsoon engage in form, and fire by platoons.\"\r\n\r\nMuch might be said for the improvement of this system; which, for its\r\nstyle and invention, may instruct generals and their historians, both in\r\nfighting a battle, and describing it when it is over. These elegant\r\nexpressions, \"Ditto,\" \"And so,\" \"But soon,\" \"But having,\" \"But could\r\nnot,\" \"But are,\" \"But they,\" \"Finds the party to have found,\" &c., do\r\ncertainly give great life and spirit to the relation. Indeed I am\r\nextremely concerned for the Lieutenant-General, who, by his overthrow\r\nand defeat, is made a deplorable instance of the fortune of war, and\r\nvicissitudes of human affairs. He, alas! has lost in Beech Lane and\r\nChiswell Street, all the glory he lately gained in and about Holborn and\r\nSt. Giles's. The art of subdividing first, and dividing afterwards, is\r\nnew and surprising; and according to this method, the troops are\r\ndisposed in King's Head Court and Red Lion Market: nor is the conduct of\r\nthese leaders less conspicuous in their choice of the ground or field of\r\nbattle. Happy was it, that the greatest part of the achievements of this\r\nday was to be performed near Grub Street,[399] that there might not be\r\nwanting a sufficient number of faithful historians, who being\r\neye-witnesses of these wonders, should impartially transmit them to\r\nposterity: but then it can never be enough regretted, that we are left\r\nin the dark as to the name and title of that extraordinary hero who\r\ncommanded the divisions in Paul's Alley; especially because those\r\ndivisions are justly styled brave, and accordingly were to push the\r\nenemy along Bunhill Row, and thereby occasion a general battle. But\r\nPallas appeared in the form of a shower of rain, and prevented the\r\nslaughter and desolation which were threatened by these extraordinary\r\npreparations.\r\n\r\n    _Hi motus animorum atque hæc certamina tanta\r\n    Pulveris exigui jactu compressa quiescunt._[400]\r\n\r\n\r\nWill's Coffee-house, July 13.\r\n\r\nSome part of the company keep up the old way of conversation in this\r\nplace, which usually turned upon the examination of nature, and an\r\ninquiry into the manners of men. There is one in the room so very\r\njudicious, that he manages impertinents with the utmost dexterity. It\r\nwas diverting this evening to hear a discourse between him and one of\r\nthese gentlemen. He told me before that person joined us, that he was a\r\nquestioner, who, according to his description, is one who asks\r\nquestions, not with a design to receive information, but an affectation\r\nto show his uneasiness for want of it. He went on in asserting, that\r\nthere are crowds of that modest ambition, as to aim no farther than to\r\ndemonstrate that they are in doubt. But by this time Will Why-not was\r\nsat down by us. \"So, gentlemen,\" says he, \"in how many days, think you,\r\nshall we be masters of Tournay? Is the account of the action of the\r\nVivarois to be depended upon? Could you have imagined England had so\r\nmuch money in it, as you see it has produced? Pray, sirs, what do you\r\nthink? Will the Duke of Savoy make an eruption into France? But,\" says\r\nhe, \"time will clear all these mysteries.\" His answer to himself gave me\r\nthe altitude of his head, and to all his questions I thus answered very\r\nsatisfactorily: \"Sir, have you heard that this Slaughterford[401] never\r\nowned the fact for which he died? Have the newspapers mentioned that\r\nmatter? But, pray, can you tell me what method will be taken to provide\r\nfor these Palatines?[402] But this, as you say, time will clear.\" \"Ay,\r\nay,\" says he, and whispers me, \"they will never let us into these things\r\nbeforehand.\" I whispered him again, \"We shall know it as soon as there\r\nis a proclamation.\" He tells me in the other ear, \"You are in the right\r\nof it.\" Then he whispered my friend to know what my name was; then made\r\nan obliging bow, and went to examine another table. This led my friend\r\nand me to weigh this wandering manner in many other incidents, and he\r\ntook out of his pockets several little notes or tickets to solicit for\r\nvotes to employments: as, \"Mr. John Taplash having served all offices,\r\nand being reduced to great poverty, desires your vote for singing clerk\r\nof this parish.\" Another \"has had ten children, all whom his wife has\r\nsuckled herself; therefore humbly desires to be a schoolmaster.\" There\r\nis nothing so frequent as this way of application for offices. It is not\r\nthat you are fit for the place, but because the place would be\r\nconvenient for you, that you claim a merit to it. But commend me to the\r\ngreat Kirleus,[403] who has lately set up for midwifery, and to help\r\nchildbirth, for no other reason, but that he is himself the Unborn\r\nDoctor. The way is to hit upon something that puts the vulgar upon the\r\nstare, or that touches their compassion, which is often the weakest part\r\nabout us. I know a good lady, who has taken her daughters from their old\r\ndancing-master, to place them with another, for no other reason, but\r\nbecause the new man has broke his leg, which is so ill set, that he can\r\nnever dance more.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom my own Apartment, July 13.\r\n\r\nAs it is a frequent mortification to me to receive letters, wherein\r\npeople tell me, without a name, they know I meant them in such and such\r\na passage; so that very accusation is an argument, that there are such\r\nbeings in human life, as fall under our description and our discourse,\r\nis not altogether fantastical and groundless. But in this case I am\r\ntreated as I saw a boy was the other day, who gave out poxy bills: every\r\nplain fellow took it that passed by, and went on his way without further\r\nnotice: at last came one with his nose a little abridged; who knocks the\r\nlad down, with a, \"Why, you son of a w----e, do you think I am p----d?\"\r\nBut Shakespeare has made the best apology for this way of talking\r\nagainst the public errors: he makes Jaques, in the play called \"As You\r\nLike It,\" express himself thus:\r\n\r\n    _Why, who cries out on pride,\r\n    That can therein tax any private party?\r\n    What woman in the city do I name,\r\n    When that I say the city woman bears\r\n    The cost of princes on unworthy shoulders?\r\n    Who can come in and say that I mean her,\r\n    When such a one as she, such is her neighbour?\r\n    Or, what is he of basest function,\r\n    That says his bravery is not on my cost?\r\n    Thinking that I mean him, but therein suits\r\n    His folly to the mettle of my speech.\r\n    There then! How then? Then let me see wherein\r\n    My tongue hath wronged him: if it do him right,\r\n    Then he hath wronged himself: if he be free,\r\n    Why then my taxing like a wild goose flies,\r\n    Unclaimed of any man._[404]\r\n\r\n\r\nSt. James's Coffee-house, July 13.\r\n\r\nWe have received, by letters of the 18th instant from the camp before\r\nTournay, an account, that we were in a fair prospect of being masters of\r\nthe town within seven days after that date. Our batteries had utterly\r\noverthrown those of the enemy. On the 16th instant, N.S., General\r\nSchuylemburg had made a lodgment on the counterscarp of the Tenaille;\r\nwhich post was so weakly defended, that we lost but six men in gaining\r\nit. So that there seems reason to hope, that the citadel will also be in\r\nthe hands of the Confederates about the 6th of August, O.S. These\r\nadvices inform us further, that Marshal Villars had ordered large\r\ndetachments to make motions towards Douay and Condé. The swift progress\r\nof this siege has so much alarmed the other frontier towns of France,\r\nthat they were throwing down some houses in the suburbs of Valenciennes,\r\nwhich they think may stand commodiously for the enemy in case that place\r\nshould be invested. The Elector of Cologne is making all imaginable\r\nhaste to remove from thence to Rheims.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 398: See Nos. 28, 38.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 399: Grub Street, Cripplegate (now Milton Street), became,\r\ntowards the end of the seventeenth century, the abode of what Johnson\r\ncalls \"writers of small histories, dictionaries and temporary poems;\r\nwhence any mean production is called Grub Street.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 400: Virgil, \"Georgics,\" iv. 86.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 401: The _Flying Post_ records that one Slaughterford was\r\nsentenced to death on July 2, 1709, for murdering his sweetheart.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 402: See Nos. 24, 51.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 403: See No. 14.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 404: \"As You Like It,\" act ii. sc. 7.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 42.

He there has a digression\r\nconcerning a possibility, that in some circumstances a man may receive\r\nan injury, and yet be conscious to himself that he deserves it. There\r\nare abundance of fine things said on the subject; but the whole wrapped\r\nup in so much jingle and pun (which was the wit of those times) that it\r\nis scarce intelligible; but I thought the design was well enough in the\r\nfollowing sketch of the old gentleman's poetry: for in this case, where\r\ntwo are rivals for the same thing, and propose to attain it by presents,\r\nhe that attempts the judge's honesty, by making him offers of reward,\r\nought not to complain when he loses his cause for a better bidder. But\r\nthe good old doggerel runs thus:[405]\r\n\r\n    _A poor man once a judge besought,\r\n      To judge aright his cause,\r\n    And with a pot of oil salutes\r\n      This judger of the laws.\r\n\r\n    \"My friend\" quoth he, \"thy cause is good\":\r\n      He glad away did trudge;\r\n    Anon his wealthy foe did come\r\n      Before this partial judge.\r\n\r\n    An hog well fed this churl presents,\r\n      And craves a strain of law;\r\n    The hog received, the poor man's right\r\n      Was judged not worth a straw.\r\n\r\n    Therewith he cried, \"O! partial judge,\r\n      Thy doom has me undone;\r\n    When oil I gave, my cause was good,\r\n      But now to ruin run.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Poor man\" quoth he, \"I thee forgot,\r\n      And see thy cause of foil;\r\n    An hog came since into my house,\r\n      And broke thy pot of oil.\"_\r\n\r\n\r\nWill's Coffee-house, July 15.\r\n\r\nThe discourse happened this evening to fall upon characters drawn in\r\nplays, and a gentleman remarked, that there was no method in the world\r\nof knowing the taste of an age, or period of time so good, as by the\r\nobservations of the persons represented in their comedies. There were\r\nseveral instances produced, as Ben Jonson's bringing in a fellow smoking\r\nas a piece of foppery;[406] \"But,\" said the gentleman who entertained us\r\non this subject, \"this matter is nowhere so observable as in the\r\ndifference of the characters of women on the stage in the last age, and\r\nin this. It is not to be supposed that it was a poverty of genius in\r\nShakespeare, that his women made so small a figure in his dialogues; but\r\nit certainly is, that he drew women as they then were in life; for that\r\nsex had not in those days that freedom in conversation; and their\r\ncharacters were only, that they were mothers, sisters, daughters, and\r\nwives. There were not then among the ladies, shining wits, politicians,\r\nvirtuosas, free-thinkers, and disputants; nay, there was then hardly\r\nsuch a creature even as a coquette: but vanity had quite another turn,\r\nand the most conspicuous woman at that time of day was only the best\r\nhousewife. Were it possible to bring into life an assembly of matrons of\r\nthat age, and introduce the learned Lady Woodby into their company, they\r\nwould not believe the same nation could produce a creature so unlike\r\nanything they ever saw in it. But these ancients would be as much\r\nastonished to see in the same age so illustrious a pattern to all who\r\nlove things praiseworthy, as the divine Aspasia.[407] Methinks, I now\r\nsee her walking in her garden like our first parent, with unaffected\r\ncharms, before beauty had spectators, and bearing celestial conscious\r\nvirtue in her aspect. Her countenance is the lively picture of her mind,\r\nwhich is the seat of honour, truth, compassion, knowledge, and\r\ninnocence.\r\n\r\n    _There dwells the scorn of vice and pity too._\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the most ample fortune, and veneration of all that\r\nbehold and know her, without the least affectation, she consults\r\nretirement, the contemplation of her own being, and that supreme power\r\nwhich bestowed it. Without the learning of schools, or knowledge of a\r\nlong course of arguments, she goes on in a steady course of\r\nuninterrupted piety and virtue, and adds to the severity and privacy of\r\nthe last age all the freedom and ease of this. The language and mien of\r\na Court she is possessed of in the highest degree; but the simplicity\r\nand humble thoughts of a cottage, are her more welcome entertainments.\r\nAspasia is a female philosopher, who does not only live up to the\r\nresignation of the most retired lives of the ancient sages, but also to\r\nthe schemes and plans which they thought beautiful, though inimitable.\r\nThis lady is the most exact economist, without appearing busy; the most\r\nstrictly virtuous, without tasting the praise of it; and shuns applause\r\nwith as much industry, as others do reproach. This character is so\r\nparticular, that it will very easily be fixed on her only, by all that\r\nknow her: but I daresay, she will be the last that finds it out. But,\r\nalas! if we have one or two such ladies, how many dozens are there like\r\nthe restless Poluglossa, who is acquainted with all the world but\r\nherself; who has the appearance of all, and possession of no one virtue:\r\nshe has indeed in her practice the absence of vice; but her discourse is\r\nthe continual history of it; and it is apparent, when she speaks of the\r\ncriminal gratifications of others, that her innocence is only a\r\nrestraint, with a certain mixture of envy. She is so perfectly opposite\r\nto the character of Aspasia, that as vice is terrible to her only as it\r\nis the object of reproach, so virtue is agreeable only as it is attended\r\nwith applause.\r\n\r\n\r\nSt. James's Coffee-house, July 15.\r\n\r\nIt is now twelve o'clock at noon, and no mail come in; therefore I am\r\nnot without hopes, that the town will allow me the liberty which my\r\nbrother news-writers take, in giving them what may be for their\r\ninformation in another kind, and indulge me in doing an act of\r\nfriendship, by publishing the following account of goods and\r\nmovables.[408]\r\n\r\nThis is to give notice, that a magnificent palace, with great variety of\r\ngardens, statues, and waterworks, may be bought cheap in Drury Lane;\r\nwhere there are likewise several castles to be disposed of, very\r\ndelightfully situated; as also groves, woods, forests, fountains, and\r\ncountry seats, with very pleasant prospects on all sides of them; being\r\nthe movables of Ch----r R----ch,[409] Esq.; who is breaking up\r\nhousekeeping, and has many curious pieces of furniture to dispose of,\r\nwhich may be seen between the hours of six and ten in the evening.\r\n\r\n#The INVENTORY.#\r\n\r\n    Spirits of right Nantes brandy, for lambent flames and apparitions.\r\n\r\n    Three bottles and a half of lightning.\r\n\r\n    One shower of snow in the whitest French paper.\r\n\r\n    Two showers of a browner sort.\r\n\r\n    A sea, consisting of a dozen large waves; the tenth bigger than\r\n    ordinary, and a little damaged.\r\n\r\n    A dozen and a half of clouds, trimmed with black, and well\r\n    conditioned.\r\n\r\n    A rainbow a little faded.\r\n\r\n    A set of clouds after the French mode, streaked with lightning, and\r\n    furbelowed.\r\n\r\n    A new-moon, something decayed.\r\n\r\n    A pint of the finest Spanish wash, being all that is left of two\r\n    hogsheads sent over last winter.\r\n\r\n    A coach very finely gilt, and little used, with a pair of dragons,\r\n    to be sold cheap.\r\n\r\n    A setting sun, a pennyworth.[410]\r\n\r\n    An imperial mantle, made for Cyrus the Great, and worn by Julius\r\n    Cæsar, Bajazet, King Harry the Eighth, and Signior Valentin.[411]\r\n\r\n    A basket-hilt sword, very convenient to carry milk in.\r\n\r\n    Roxana's night-gown.\r\n\r\n    Othello's handkerchief.\r\n\r\n    The imperial robes of Xerxes, never worn but once.\r\n\r\n    A wild-boar, killed by Mrs. Tofts[412] and Dioclesian.\r\n\r\n    A serpent to sting Cleopatra.\r\n\r\n    A mustard-bowl to make thunder with.\r\n\r\n    Another of a bigger sort, by Mr. D----is's directions, little\r\n    used.[413]\r\n\r\n    Six elbow-chairs, very expert in country-dances, with six\r\n    flower-pots for their partners.\r\n\r\n    The whiskers of a Turkish bassa.\r\n\r\n    The complexion of a murderer in a band-box; consisting of a large\r\n    piece of burnt cork, and a coal-black peruke.\r\n\r\n    A suit of clothes for a ghost, viz., a bloody shirt, a doublet\r\n    curiously pinked, and a coat with three great eyelet-holes upon the\r\n    breast.\r\n\r\n    A bale of red Spanish wool.\r\n\r\n    Modern plots, commonly known by the name of trapdoors, ladders of\r\n    ropes, vizard-masks, and tables with broad carpets over them.\r\n\r\n    Three oak cudgels, with one of crab-tree; all bought for the use of\r\n    Mr. Pinkethman.\r\n\r\n    Materials for dancing; as masks, castanets, and a ladder of ten\r\n    rounds.\r\n\r\n    Aurengezebe's scimitar, made by Will Brown in Piccadilly.\r\n\r\n    A plume of feathers, never used but by Oedipus and the Earl of\r\n    Essex.\r\n\r\nThere are also swords, halberts, sheep-hooks, cardinals' hats, turbans,\r\ndrums, gallipots, a gibbet, a cradle, a rack, a cart-wheel, an altar, a\r\nhelmet, a back-piece, a breast-plate, a bell, a tub, and a jointed\r\nbaby.[414]\r\n\r\nThese are the hard shifts we intelligencers are forced to; therefore our\r\nreaders ought to excuse us, if a westerly wind blowing for a fortnight\r\ntogether, generally fills every paper with an order of battle; when we\r\nshow our martial skill in each line, and, according to the space we have\r\nto fill, we range our men in squadrons and battalions, or draw out\r\ncompany by company, and troop by troop; ever observing, that no muster\r\nis to be made, but when the wind is in a cross point, which often\r\nhappens at the end of a campaign, when half the men are deserted or\r\nkilled. The _Courant_ is sometimes ten deep, his ranks close: the\r\n_Postboy_[415] is generally in files, for greater exactness; and the\r\n_Postman_ comes down upon you rather after the Turkish way, sword in\r\nhand, pell-mell, without form or discipline; but sure to bring men\r\nenough into the field; and wherever they are raised, never to lose a\r\nbattle for want of numbers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 405: From George Whetstone's \"English Mirror,\" 1586.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 406: See \"Every Man out of his Humour,\" act ii. sc. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 407: Lady Elizabeth Hastings, unquestionably one of the most\r\naccomplished and virtuous characters of the age in which she lived, was\r\nthe daughter of Theophilus Hastings, the 7th Earl of Huntingdon, and of\r\nElizabeth, eldest daughter and co-heiress to John Lewes, of Ledstone, in\r\nYorkshire, Knt. and Bart.

It is said,\r\nwith great probability, that since the commencement of the Christian\r\nera, scarce any age has produced a lady of such high birth and superior\r\naccomplishments, that was a greater blessing to many, or a brighter\r\npattern to all. There is an admirable sketch of this illustrious lady's\r\ncharacter, drawn soon after her death, in the tenth volume of the\r\n_Gentleman's Magazine_, p. 36, probably by Samuel Johnson. See also \"An\r\nhistorical Character relating to the holy and exemplary Life of the\r\nRight Honourable the Lady Elisabeth Hastings, &c. By Thomas Barnard,\r\nA.M. Printed at Leeds, in 1742, 12mo\" (Nichols).--Lady Elizabeth\r\nHastings, who came into a fortune upon the death of her brother George,\r\nEarl of Huntingdon, settled at Ledstone House, where she was the Lady\r\nBountiful of the neighbourhood. Her whole estate, however, is said to\r\nhave been less than £3000 a year. The best of the clergy of the day were\r\namong her friends. She helped Berkeley in his Bermuda Mission scheme,\r\nand she befriended Miss Mary Astell. Ralph Thoresby, who visited her,\r\nwas \"extremely pleased with the most agreeable conversation of the pious\r\nand excellent Lady Elizabeth Hastings.\" (\"Diary,\" ii. 82). She was one\r\nof the numerous eligible ladies that the friends of Lord Raby,\r\nafterwards Earl of Strafford, suggested to him as a suitable wife\r\n(\"Wentworth Papers,\" pp. 29, 56). The character of Aspasia in this paper\r\nhas been attributed to Congreve, on the ground, apparently, that he knew\r\nLady Elizabeth Hastings' half-brother, Theophilus, afterwards Earl of\r\nHuntingdon.

There is a\r\ndeplorable instance of this in the case of Mr. D----y,[416] who has\r\ndedicated his inimitable comedy, called, \"The Modern Prophets,\" to a\r\nworthy knight,[417] to whom, it seems, he had before communicated his\r\nplan, which was, to ridicule the ridiculous of our established doctrine.\r\nI have elsewhere celebrated the contrivance of this excellent drama; but\r\nwas not, till I read the dedication, wholly let into the religious\r\ndesign of it. I am afraid it has suffered discontinuance at this gay end\r\nof the town, for no other reason but the piety of the purpose. There is\r\nhowever in this epistle the true life of panegyrical performance; and I\r\ndo not doubt but, if the patron would part with it, I can help him to\r\nothers with good pretensions to it; viz., of uncommon understanding, who\r\nwould give him as much as he gave for it. I know perfectly well a noble\r\nperson to whom these words (which are the body of the panegyric) would\r\nfit to a hair.\r\n\r\n\"Your easiness of humour, or rather your harmonious disposition, is so\r\nadmirably mixed with your composure, that the rugged cares and\r\ndisturbance that public affairs brings with it, which does so\r\nvexatiously affect the heads of other great men of business, &c. does\r\nscarce ever ruffle your unclouded brow so much as with a frown. And what\r\nabove all is praiseworthy, you are so far from thinking yourself better\r\nthan others, that a flourishing and opulent fortune, which by a certain\r\nnatural corruption in its quality, seldom fails to infect other\r\npossessors with pride, seems in this case as if only providentially\r\ndisposed to enlarge your humility.\r\n\r\n\"But I find, sir, I am now got into a very large field, where though I\r\ncould with great ease raise a number of plants in relation to your merit\r\nof this plauditory nature; yet for fear of an author's general vice, and\r\nthat the plain justice I have done you should, by my proceeding and\r\nothers' mistaken judgment, be imagined flattery, a thing the bluntness\r\nof my nature does not care to be concerned with, and which I also know\r\nyou abominate.\"\r\n\r\nIt is wonderful to see how many judges of these fine things spring up\r\nevery day by the rise of stocks, and other elegant methods of abridging\r\nthe way to learning and criticism. But I do hereby forbid all\r\ndedications to any persons within the city of London, except Sir\r\nFrancis, Sir Stephen,[418] and the Bank, will take epigrams and epistles\r\nas value received for their notes; and the East India Companies accept\r\nof heroic poems for their sealed bonds. Upon which bottom, our\r\npublishers have full power to treat with the city in behalf of us\r\nauthors, to enable traders to become patrons and Fellows of the Royal\r\nSociety, as well as receive certain degrees of skill in the Latin and\r\nGreek tongues, according to the quantity of the commodities which they\r\ntake off our hands.\r\n\r\n\r\nGrecian Coffee-house, July 18.\r\n\r\nThe learned have so long laboured under the imputation of dryness and\r\ndulness in their accounts of their phenomena, that an ingenious\r\ngentleman of our society has resolved to write a system of philosophy in\r\na more lively method, both as to the matter and language, than has been\r\nhitherto attempted. He read to us the plan upon which he intends to\r\nproceed. I thought his account, by way of fable of the worlds about us,\r\nhad so much vivacity in it, that I could not forbear transcribing his\r\nhypothesis, to give the reader a taste of my friend's treatise, which is\r\nnow in the press.[419]\r\n\r\n\"The inferior deities having designed on a day to play a game at\r\nfootball, knead together a numberless collection of dancing atoms into\r\nthe form of seven rolling globes: and that nature might be kept from a\r\ndull inactivity, each separate particle is endued with a principle of\r\nmotion, or a power of attraction, whereby all the several parcels of\r\nmatter draw each other proportionately to their magnitudes and\r\ndistances, into such a remarkable variety of different forms, as to\r\nproduce all the wonderful appearances we now observe in empire,\r\nphilosophy, and religion. To proceed; at the beginning of the game, each\r\nof the globes being struck forward with a vast violence, ran out of\r\nsight, and wandered in a straight line through the infinite spaces. The\r\nnimble deities pursue, breathless almost, and spent in the eager chase;\r\neach of them caught hold of one, and stamped it with his name; as,\r\nSaturn, Jupiter, Mars, and so of the rest. To prevent this inconvenience\r\nfor the future, the seven are condemned to a precipitation, which in our\r\ninferior style we call 'gravity.' Thus the tangential and centripetal\r\nforces, by their counter-struggle, make the celestial bodies describe an\r\nexact ellipsis.\"\r\n\r\nThere will be added to this an appendix, in defence of the first day of\r\nthe term according to the Oxford Almanac,[420] by a learned knight of\r\nthis realm, with an apology for the said knight's manner of dress;\r\nproving, that his habit, according to this hypothesis, is the true\r\nmodern and fashionable; and that buckles are not to be worn, by this\r\nsystem, till the 10th of March, in the year 1714, which, according to\r\nthe computation of some of our greatest divines, is to be the first year\r\nof the Millennium[421]; in which blessed age, all habits will be reduced\r\nto a primitive simplicity; and whoever shall be found to have persevered\r\nin a constancy of dress, in spite of all the allurements of profane and\r\nheathen habits, shall be rewarded with a never-fading doublet of a\r\nthousand years. All points in the system which are doubted, shall be\r\nattested by the knight's extemporary oath, for the satisfaction of his\r\nreaders.\r\n\r\n\r\nWill's Coffee-house, July 18.\r\n\r\nWe were upon the heroic strain this evening, and the question was, What\r\nis the True Sublime? Many very good discourses happened thereupon; after\r\nwhich a gentleman at the table, who is, it seems, writing on that\r\nsubject, assumed the argument; and though he ran through many instances\r\nof sublimity from the ancient writers, said, he had hardly known an\r\noccasion wherein the true greatness of soul, which animates a general in\r\naction, is so well represented, with regard to the person of whom it was\r\nspoken, and the time in which it was writ, as in a few lines in a modern\r\npoem: \"there is,\" continued he, \"nothing so forced and constrained, as\r\nwhat we frequently meet with in tragedies; to make a man under the\r\nweight of a great sorrow, or full of meditation upon what he is soon to\r\nexecute, cast about for a simile to what he himself is, or the thing\r\nwhich he is going to act: but there is nothing more proper and natural\r\nthan for a poet, whose business is to describe, and who is spectator of\r\none in that circumstance when his mind is working upon a great image,\r\nand that the ideas hurry upon his imagination--I say, there is nothing\r\nso natural, as for a poet to relieve and clear himself from the burthen\r\nof thought at that time, by uttering his conception in simile and\r\nmetaphor. The highest act of the mind of man, is to possess itself with\r\ntranquillity in imminent danger, and to have its thoughts so free, as to\r\nact at that time without perplexity. The ancient poets have compared\r\nthis sedate courage to a rock that remains immovable amidst the rage of\r\nwinds and waves; but that is too stupid and inanimate a similitude, and\r\ncould do no credit to the hero. At other times they are all of them\r\nwonderfully obliged to a Lybian lion, which may give indeed very\r\nagreeable terrors to a description; but is no compliment to the person\r\nto whom it is applied: eagles, tigers, and wolves, are made use of on\r\nthe same occasion, and very often with much beauty; but this is still an\r\nhonour done to the brute, rather than the hero. Mars, Pallas, Bacchus,\r\nand Hercules, have each of them furnished very good similes in their\r\ntime, and made, doubtless, a greater impression on the mind of a\r\nheathen, than they have on that of a modern reader. But the sublime\r\nimage that I am talking of, and which I really think as great as ever\r\nentered into the thought of man, is in the poem called, 'The\r\nCampaign';[422] where the simile of a ministering angel sets forth the\r\nmost sedate and the most active courage, engaged in an uproar of nature,\r\na confusion of elements, and a scene of divine vengeance. Add to all,\r\nthat these lines compliment the General and his Queen at the same time,\r\nand have all the natural horrors, heightened by the image that was still\r\nfresh in the mind of every reader.[423]\r\n\r\n    \"_'Twas then great Marlborough's mighty soul was proved,\r\n    That, in the shock of charging hosts unmoved,\r\n    Amidst confusion, horror, and despair,\r\n    Examined all the dreadful scenes of war;\r\n    In peaceful thought the field of death surveyed,\r\n    To fainting squadrons sent the timely aid,\r\n    Inspired repulsed battalions to engage,\r\n    And taught the doubtful battle where to rage.\r\n    So when an angel by divine command,\r\n    With rising tempests shakes a guilty land,\r\n    Such as of late o'er pale Britannia past,\r\n    Calm and serene he drives the furious blast;\r\n    And, pleased the Almighty's orders to perform,\r\n    Rides in the whirlwind, and directs the storm._\r\n\r\n\"The whole poem is so exquisitely noble and poetic, that I think it an\r\nhonour to our nation and language.\" The gentleman concluded his critique\r\non this work, by saying, that he esteemed it wholly new, and a wonderful\r\nattempt to keep up the ordinary ideas of a march of an army, just as\r\nthey happened in so warm and great a style, and yet be at once familiar\r\nand heroic. Such a performance is a chronicle as well as a poem, and\r\nwill preserve the memory of our hero, when all the edifices and statues\r\nerected to his honour are blended with common dust.\r\n\r\n\r\nSt. James's Coffee-house, July 18.\r\n\r\nLetters from the Hague of the 23rd instant, N.S., say, that the Allies\r\nwere so forward in the siege of Tournay, that they were preparing for a\r\ngeneral assault, which, it was supposed, would be made within a few\r\ndays. Deserters from the town gave an account, that the garrison was\r\ncarrying their ammunition and provisions into the citadel, which\r\noccasioned a tumult among the inhabitants of the town. The French army\r\nhad laid bridges over the Scarp, and made a motion as if they intended\r\nto pass that river; but though they are joined by the reinforcement\r\nexpected from Germany, it was not believed they should make any attempt\r\ntowards relieving Tournay. Letters from Brabant say, there has been a\r\ndiscovery made of a design to deliver up Antwerp to the enemy. The\r\nStates of Holland have agreed to a general naturalisation of all\r\nProtestants who shall fly into their dominions; to which purpose, a\r\nproclamation was to be issued within few days.\r\n\r\nThey write from France, that the great misery and want under which that\r\nnation has so long laboured, has ended in a pestilence, which began to\r\nappear in Burgundy and Dauphiné. They add, that in the town of Mazon,\r\nthree hundred persons had died in the space of ten days. Letters from\r\nLille of the 24th instant advise, that great numbers of deserters came\r\ndaily into that city, the most part of whom are dragoons. We are advised\r\nfrom France, that the Loire having overflowed its banks, hath laid the\r\ncountry under water for three hundred miles together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 416: See Nos. 1 and 11. In No. 29 of the _Guardian_ Steele\r\naccused the world of ingratitude in not properly \"rewarding the jocose\r\nlabours of my friend, Mr. Durfey\"; and in No. 67 Addison urged the town\r\nto go to a performance at the theatre given for Durfey's benefit. \"He\r\nhas made the town merry, and I hope they will make him easy, so long as\r\nhe stays among us.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 417: Sir William Scawen, a merchant who was knighted in 1692.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 418: Probably Sir Francis Child and Sir Stephen Evance, the\r\nbankers.

I asked\r\nimmediately, what young heir or lover owned that glittering equipage?\r\nBut my companion interrupted: \"Do not you see there the mourning\r\nÆsculapius?\"[424] \"The mourning!\" said I. \"Yes, Isaac,\" said Pacolet,\r\n\"he is in deep mourning, and is the languishing hopeless lover of the\r\ndivine Hebe, the emblem of youth and beauty. The excellent and learned\r\nsage you behold in that furniture, is the strongest instance imaginable,\r\nthat love is the most powerful of all things. You are not so ignorant as\r\nto be a stranger to the character of Æsculapius, as the patron and most\r\nsuccessful of all who profess the art of medicine. But as most of his\r\noperations are owing to a natural sagacity or impulse, he has very\r\nlittle troubled himself with the doctrine of drugs; but has always given\r\nNature more room to help herself, than any of her learned assistants;\r\nand consequently has done greater wonders than is in the power of art to\r\nperform;[425] for which reason, he is half deified by the people; and\r\nhas ever been justly courted by all the world, as if he were a seventh\r\nson. It happened, that the charming Hebe was reduced, by a long and\r\nviolent fever, to the most extreme danger of death; and when all skill\r\nfailed, they sent for Æsculapius. The renowned artist was touched with\r\nthe deepest compassion to see the faded charms and faint bloom of Hebe;\r\nand had a generous concern in beholding a struggle, not between life,\r\nbut rather between youth, and death. All his skill and his passion\r\ntended to the recovery of Hebe, beautiful even in sickness: but, alas!\r\nthe unhappy physician knew not, that in all his care he was only\r\nsharpening darts for his own destruction. In a word, his fortune was the\r\nsame with that of the statuary, who fell in love with the image of his\r\nown making; and the unfortunate Æsculapius is become the patient of her\r\nwhom he lately recovered. Long before this disaster, Æsculapius was far\r\ngone in the unnecessary and superfluous amusements of old age, in\r\nincreasing unwieldy stores, and providing, in the midst of an incapacity\r\nof enjoyment of what he had, for a supply of more wants than he had\r\ncalls for in youth itself. But these low considerations are now no more,\r\nand love has taken place of avarice, or rather has become an avarice of\r\nanother kind, which still urges him to pursue what he does not want. But\r\nbehold the metamorphosis; the anxious mean cares of an usurer are turned\r\ninto the languishments and complaints of a lover. 'Behold,' says the\r\naged Æsculapius, 'I submit, I own, great Love, thy empire: pity, Hebe,\r\nthe fop you have made: what have I to do with gilding but on pills? Yet,\r\nO fair! For thee I sit amidst a crowd of painted deities on my chariot,\r\nbuttoned in gold, clasped in gold, without having any value for that\r\nbeloved metal, but as it adorns the person, and laces the hat of thy\r\ndying lover. I ask not to live, O Hebe! Give me but gentle death:\r\neuthanasia, euthanasia, that is all I implore.'\" When Æsculapius had\r\nfinished his complaint, Pacolet went on in deep morals on the\r\nuncertainty of riches, with this remarkable exclamation; \"O wealth! How\r\nimpotent art thou! And how little dost thou supply us with real\r\nhappiness, when the usurer himself can forget thee for the love of what\r\nis as foreign to his felicity as thou art?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWill's Coffee-house, July 19.\r\n\r\nThe company here, who have all a delicate taste of theatrical\r\nrepresentations, had made a gathering to purchase the movables of the\r\nneighbouring playhouse,[426] for the encouragement of one which is\r\nsetting up in the Haymarket. But the proceedings at the auction (by\r\nwhich method the goods have been sold this evening) have been so unfair,\r\nthat this generous design has been frustrated; for the Imperial Mantle\r\nmade for Cyrus was missing, as also the Chariot and Two Dragons: but\r\nupon examination it was found, that a gentleman of Hampshire[427] had\r\nclandestinely bought them both, and is gone down to his country seat;\r\nand that on Saturday last he passed through Staines attired in that\r\nrobe, and drawn by the said Dragons, assisted by two only of his own\r\nhorses. This theatrical traveller has also left orders with Mr.\r\nHall[428] to send the faded rainbow to the scourers, and when it comes\r\nhome, to despatch it after him. At the same time C---- R----[429] Esq.\r\nis invited to bring down himself his Setting Sun, and be box-keeper to a\r\ntheatre erected by this gentleman near Southampton. Thus there has been\r\nnothing but artifice in the management of this affair; for which reason\r\nI beg pardon of the town, that I inserted the inventory in my paper and\r\nsolemnly protest, I knew nothing of this artful design of vending these\r\nrarities: but I meant only the good of the world in that and all other\r\nthings which I divulge. And now I am upon this subject, I must do myself\r\njustice in relation to an article in a former paper, wherein I made\r\nmention of a person who keeps a puppet-show in the town of Bath;[430] I\r\nwas tender of naming names, and only just hinted, that he makes larger\r\npromises, when he invites people to his dramatic representations, than\r\nhe is able to perform: but I am credibly informed, that he makes a\r\nprofane lewd jester, which he calls Punch, speak to the dishonour of\r\nIsaac Bickerstaff with great familiarity; and before all my learned\r\nfriends in that place, takes upon him to dispute my title to the\r\nappellation of Esquire. I think I need not say much to convince all the\r\nworld, that this Mr. Powell (for that is his name) is a pragmatical and\r\nvain person to pretend to argue with me on any subject. _Mecum certasse\r\nferetur_[431]; that is to say, it will be an honour to him to have it\r\nsaid he contended with me; but I would have him to know, that I can look\r\nbeyond his wires, and know very well the whole trick of his art, and\r\nthat it is only by these wires that the eye of the spectator is cheated,\r\nand hindered from seeing that there is a thread on one of Punch's chops,\r\nwhich draws it up, and lets it fall at the discretion of the said\r\nPowell, who stands behind and plays him, and makes him speak saucily of\r\nhis betters. He! to pretend to make prologues against me! But a man\r\nnever behaves himself with decency in his own case; therefore I shall\r\ncommand myself, and never trouble me further with this little fellow,\r\nwho is himself but a tall puppet, and has not brains enough to make even\r\nwood speak as it ought to do: and I, that have heard the groaning\r\nboard,[432] can despise all that his puppets shall be able to speak as\r\nlong as they live. But, _Ex quovis ligno non fit Mercurius_[433]. He has\r\npretended to write to me also from the Bath, and says, he thought to\r\nhave deferred giving me an answer till he came to his books[434]; but\r\nthat my writings might do well with the waters: which are pert\r\nexpressions that become a schoolboy, better than one that is to teach\r\nothers: and when I have said a civil thing to him, he cries, \"Oh! I\r\nthank you for that--I am your humble servant for that.\"[435] Ah! Mr.\r\nPowell, these smart civilities will never run down men of learning: I\r\nknow well enough your design is to have all men automata, like your\r\npuppets; but the world is grown too wise, and can look through these\r\nthin devices. I know you design to make a reply to this; but be sure you\r\nstick close to my words; for if you bring me into discourses concerning\r\nthe government of your puppets, I must tell you, I neither am, nor have\r\nbeen, nor will be, at leisure to answer you. It is really a burning\r\nshame this man should be tolerated in abusing the world with such\r\nrepresentations of things: but his parts decay, and he is not much more\r\nalive than Partridge.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom my own Apartment, July 14.\r\n\r\nI must beg pardon of my readers that for this time I have, I fear,\r\nhuddled up my discourse, having been very busy in helping an old friend\r\nof mine out of town. He has a very good estate, is a man of wit; but he\r\nhad been three years absent from town, and cannot bear a jest; for\r\nwhich reason I have, with some pains, convinced him, that he can no\r\nmore live here than if he were a downright bankrupt. He was so fond of\r\ndear London, that he began to fret only inwardly; but being unable to\r\nlaugh and be laughed at, I took a place in the northern coach for him\r\nand his family; and hope he is got to-night safe from all sneerers in\r\nhis own parlour.\r\n\r\n\r\nSt. James's Coffee-house, July 20.\r\n\r\nThis morning we received by express, the agreeable news of the surrender\r\nof the town of Tournay on the 28th instant, N.S. The place was assaulted\r\nat the attacks of General Schuylemburg, and that of General Lottum, at\r\nthe same time. The action at both those parts of the town was very\r\nobstinate, and the Allies lost a considerable number at the beginning of\r\nthe dispute; but the fight was continued with so great bravery, that the\r\nenemy observing that we were masters of all the posts which were\r\nnecessary for a general attack, beat the chamade,[436] and hostages were\r\nreceived from the town, and others sent from the besiegers, in order to\r\ncome to a formal capitulation for the surrender of the place. We have\r\nalso this day received advice, that Sir John Leake, who lies off of\r\nDunkirk, had intercepted several ships laden with corn from the Baltic;\r\nand that the Dutch privateers had fallen in with others, and carried\r\nthem into Holland. The French letters advise, that the young son to the\r\nDuke of Anjou lived but eight days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 424: Dr. John Radcliffe, the physician (1650-1714), was\r\ndisappointed in love when about sixty. The matter is referred to again\r\nin Nos. 46, 47, 50 and 67. Radcliffe became rich, but was considered to\r\nbe a quack by many other doctors. \"The last _Tatler_ is upon Dr. Ratclif\r\nwho they say is desparately in love with Dutchess of Bolton, his passion\r\nruns so high as to declare he'll make her eldest son his heir, upon wch\r\naccount they say the Duke of B---- is not at all alarm'd, but gives the\r\nOld amorist opportunity to make his Court, the Dr. lately gave the\r\nDutchess and some other Ladys an entertainm' of musick upon the water,\r\nand a fine supper in the Barge\" (\"Wentworth Papers,\" p. 97). This\r\nidentification of Hebe with the Duchess of Bolton is corroborated by the\r\nMS. annotator mentioned in a note to No. 4. According to another account\r\nshe was a Miss Tempest, a maid of honour to the Queen. The writer of the\r\narticle on Radcliffe in the \"Biog. Britannica\" says: \"The lady, who made\r\nthe doctor, at this advanced age, stand in need of a physician himself,\r\nwas of great beauty, wealth, and quality; and too attractive not to\r\ninspire the coldest heart with the warmest sentiments. After he had made\r\na cure of her, he could not but imagine, as naturally he might, that her\r\nladyship would entertain a favourable opinion of him. But the lady,\r\nhowever grateful she might be for the care he had taken of her health,\r\ndivulged the secret, and one of her confidants revealed it to Steele,\r\nwho, on account of party, was so ill-natured as to write the ridicule of\r\nit in the _Tatler_\" Radcliffe never married.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 425: I have a pamphlet called \"The _Tatler's_ Character (July\r\n21) of Æsculapius guessing diseases, without the knowledge of drugs;\r\napplied to the British Physicians and Surgeons: or, The difficult\r\ndiseases of the Royal Family, Nobility and Gentry will never be\r\nunderstood and recover'd, when the populace are oppress'd and destroy'd\r\nby the Practising-Apothecaries and Empiricks confess'd by the College\r\nand Mr. Bernard the Surgeon.

In March 1709, Blackall preached\r\nbefore the Queen a sermon laying down the doctrine of passive obedience\r\nin its most extreme form, but in 1704 he had preached obedience limited\r\nby the laws of the State. Hoadly wrote against the sermon of 1709, and\r\nbrought against the Bishop the sermon of 1704. The Bishop, angry at this\r\nmode of refutation, answered haughtily, and dwelt on the superiority of\r\nhis rank as compared with that of Hoadly, then simply rector of a London\r\nparish. Bickerstaff here reproaches Blackall for the pride and rudeness\r\nof his answer, and then, under the guise of Powell, proprietor of the\r\npuppet-show, satirises the extreme doctrine of divine right taught by\r\nthe Bishop, a doctrine which would make the subjects mere automata, to\r\nbe moved only at the will of the prince.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 431: Ovid, \"Met.\" xiii. 20.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 432: The following printed advertisement appeared in 1682: \"At\r\nthe sign of the wool-sack, in Newgate-market, is to be seen, a strange\r\nand wonderful thing, which is an elm-board, being touched with a hot\r\niron, doth express itself, as if it were a man dying with groans, and\r\ntrembling, to the great admiration of all the hearers.

From one angle of the\r\nhedge, I heard a voice cry, \"Sir, sir--\" This raised my curiosity, and I\r\nheard the same voice say, but in a gentle tone, \"Come forward, come\r\nforward.\" I did so, and one through the hedge called me by my name, and\r\nbade me go on to the left, and I should be admitted to visit an old\r\nacquaintance in distress. The laws of knight-errantry made me obey the\r\nsummons without hesitation; and I was let in at the back gate of a\r\nlovely house by a maid-servant, who carried me from room to room, until\r\nI came into a gallery; at the end of which, I saw a fine lady dressed in\r\nthe most sumptuous habit, as if she were going to a ball, but with the\r\nmost abject and disconsolate sorrow in her face that I ever beheld. As I\r\ncame near, she burst into tears, and cried, \"Sir, do not you know the\r\nunhappy Teraminta?\" I soon recollected her whole person: \"But,\" said I,\r\n\"madam, the simplicity of dress, in which I have ever seen you at your\r\ngood father's house, and the cheerfulness of countenance with which you\r\nalways appeared, are so unlike the fashion and temper you are now in,\r\nthat I did not easily recover the memory of you. Your habit was then\r\ndecent and modest, your looks serene and beautiful: whence then this\r\nunaccountable change? Nothing can speak so deep a sorrow as your present\r\naspect; yet your dress is made for jollity and revelling.\" \"It is,\" said\r\nshe, \"an unspeakable pleasure to meet with one I know, and to bewail\r\nmyself to any that is not an utter stranger to humanity. When your\r\nfriend my father died, he left me to a wide world, with no defence\r\nagainst the insults of fortune, but rather, a thousand snares to entrap\r\nme in the dangers to which youth and innocence are exposed, in an age\r\nwherein honour and virtue are become mere words, and used only as they\r\nserve to betray those who understand them in their native sense, and\r\nobey them as the guides and motives of their being. The wickedest of all\r\nmen living, the abandoned Decius, who has no knowledge of any good art\r\nor purpose of human life, but as it tends to the satisfaction of his\r\nappetites, had opportunities of frequently seeing and entertaining me at\r\na house where mixed company boarded, and where he placed himself for the\r\nbase intention which he has since brought to pass. Decius saw enough in\r\nme to raise his brutal desires, and my circumstances gave him hopes of\r\naccomplishing them. But all the glittering expectations he could lay\r\nbefore me, joined by my private terrors of poverty itself, could not for\r\nsome months prevail upon me; yet, however I hated his intention, I still\r\nhad a secret satisfaction in his courtship, and always exposed myself to\r\nhis solicitations. See here the bane of our sex! Let the flattery be\r\nnever so apparent, the flatterer never so ill thought of, his praises\r\nare still agreeable and we contribute to our own deceit. I was therefore\r\never fond of all opportunities and pretences of being in his company. In\r\na word, I was at last ruined by him, and brought to this place, where I\r\nhave been ever since immured; and from the fatal day after my fall from\r\ninnocence, my worshipper became my master and my tyrant. Thus you see me\r\nhabited in the most gorgeous manner, not in honour of me as a woman he\r\nloves, but as this attire charms his own eye, and urges him to repeat\r\nthe gratification he takes in me, as the servant of his brutish lusts\r\nand appetites. I know not where to fly for redress; but am here pining\r\naway life in the solitude and severity of a nun, but the conscience and\r\nguilt of a harlot. I live in this lewd practice with a religious awe of\r\nmy minister of darkness, upbraided with the support I receive from him,\r\nfor the inestimable possession of youth, of innocence, of honour, and of\r\nconscience. I see, sir, my discourse grows painful to you; all I beg of\r\nyou is, to paint in so strong colours, as to let Decius see I am\r\ndiscovered to be in his possession, that I may be turned out of this\r\ndetestable scene of regular iniquity, and either think no more, or sin\r\nno more. If your writings have the good effect of gaining my\r\nenlargement, I promise you I will atone for this unhappy step, by\r\npreferring an innocent laborious poverty, to all the guilty affluence\r\nthe world can offer me.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWill's Coffee-house, July 21.\r\n\r\nTo show that I do not bear an irreconcilable hatred to my mortal enemy,\r\nMr. Powell at Bath, I do his function the honour to publish to the\r\nworld, that plays represented by puppets are permitted in our\r\nuniversities,[437] and that sort of drama is not wholly thought unworthy\r\nthe critic of learned heads: but as I have been conversant rather with\r\nthe greater Ode, as I think the critics call it, I must be so humble as\r\nto make a request to Mr. Powell, and desire him to apply his thoughts\r\nto answering the difficulties with which my kinsman, the author of the\r\nfollowing letter, seems to be embarrassed.\r\n\r\n#\"_To my Honoured Kinsman, Isaac Bickerstaff, Esq._#\r\n\r\n\"DEAR COUSIN,\r\n\r\n\"Had the family of the Beadlestaffs,[438] whereof I, though unworthy, am\r\none, known of your being lately at Oxon, we had in our own name, and in\r\nthe Universities' (as it is our office), made you a compliment: but your\r\nshort stay here robbed us of an opportunity of paying our due respects,\r\nand you of receiving an ingenious entertainment, with which we at\r\npresent divert ourselves and strangers. A puppet-show at this time\r\nsupplies the want of an Act.[439] And since the nymphs of this city are\r\ndisappointed of a luscious music-speech, and the country ladies of\r\nhearing their sons or brothers speak verses; yet the vocal machines,\r\nlike them, by the help of a prompter, say things as much to the benefit\r\nof the audience, and almost as properly their own. The licence of a\r\nTerræ-Filius[440] is refined to the well-bred satire of Punchinello.\r\nNow, Cousin Bickerstaff, though Punch has neither a French nightcap, nor\r\nlong pockets, yet you must own him to be a pretty fellow, a 'very'\r\npretty fellow: nay, since he seldom leaves the company, without\r\ncalling, 'Son of a whore,' demanding satisfaction, and duelling, he must\r\nbe owned a smart fellow too. Yet, by some indecencies towards the\r\nladies, he seems to be of a third character, distinct from any you have\r\nyet touched upon. A young gentleman who sat next me (for I had the\r\ncuriosity of seeing this entertainment), in a tufted gown, red\r\nstockings, and long wig (which I pronounce to be tantamount to red heels\r\nand a dangling cane[441]) was enraged when Punchinello disturbed a soft\r\nlove-scene with his ribaldry. You would oblige us mightily by laying\r\ndown some rules for adjusting the extravagant behaviour of this\r\nAlmanzor[442] of the play, and by writing a treatise on this sort of\r\ndramatic poetry, so much favoured, and so little understood, by the\r\nlearned world. From its being conveyed in a cart after the Thespian\r\nmanner, all the parts being recited by one person, as the custom was\r\nbefore Æschylus, and the behaviour of Punch as if he had won the goal,\r\nyou may possibly deduce its antiquity, and settle the chronology, as\r\nwell as some of our modern critics. In its natural transitions, from\r\nmournful to merry; as, from the hanging of a lover, to dancing upon the\r\nrope; from the stalking of a ghost, to a lady's presenting you with a\r\njig; you may discover such a decorum, as is not to be found elsewhere\r\nthan in our tragi-comedies. But I forget myself; it is not for me to\r\ndictate: I thought fit, dear cousin, to give you these hints, to show\r\nyou that the Beadlestaffs don't walk before men of letters to no\r\npurpose; and that though we do but hold up the train of arts and\r\nsciences, yet like other pages, we are now and then let into our\r\nladies' secrets. I am,\r\n\r\n\"Your most\r\n\r\n\"Affectionate Kinsman,\r\n\r\n                                        \"BENJAMIN BEADLESTAFF.\r\n\r\n\"From Mother Gourdon's, at Hedington,[443] near Oxon, _June 18_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom my own Apartment, July 22.\r\n\r\nI am got hither safe, but never spent time with so little satisfaction\r\nas this evening; for you must know, I was five hours with three Merry,\r\nand two Honest Fellows. The former sang catches; and the latter even\r\ndied with laughing at the noise they made. \"Well,\" says Tom Belfrey,\r\n\"you scholars, Mr. Bickerstaff, are the worst company in the world.\"\r\n\"Ay,\" says his opposite, \"you are dull to-night; prithee be merry.\" With\r\nthat I huzzaed, and took a jump across the table, then came clever upon\r\nmy legs, and fell a-laughing. \"Let Mr. Bickerstaff alone,\" says one of\r\nthe Honest Fellows, \"when he's in a good humour, he's as good company as\r\nany man in England.\" He had no sooner spoke, but I snatched his hat off\r\nhis head, and clapped his upon my own, and burst out a-laughing again;\r\nupon which we all fell a-laughing for half an hour. One of the Honest\r\nFellows got behind me in the interim, and hit me a sound slap on the\r\nback; upon which he got the laugh out of my hands, and it was such a\r\ntwang on my shoulders, that I confess he was much merrier than I. I was\r\nhalf angry; but resolved to keep up the good humour of the company; and\r\nafter holloing as loud as I could possibly, I drank off a bumper of\r\nclaret, that made me stare again. \"Nay,\" says one of the Honest Fellows,\r\n\"Mr. Isaac is in the right, there is no conversation in this; what\r\nsignifies jumping, or hitting one another on the back? Let's drink\r\nabout.\" We did so from seven o'clock till eleven; and now I am come\r\nhither, and, after the manner of the wise Pythagoras, begin to reflect\r\nupon the passages of the day. I remember nothing, but that I am bruised\r\nto death; and as it is my way to write down all the good things I have\r\nheard in the last conversation to furnish my paper, I can from this only\r\ntell you my sufferings and my bangs. I named Pythagoras just now, and I\r\nprotest to you, as he believed men after death entered into other\r\nspecies, I am now and then tempted to think other animals enter into\r\nmen, and could name several on two legs, that never discover any\r\nsentiment above what is common with the species of a lower kind; as we\r\nsee in these bodily wits whom I was with to-night, whose parts consist\r\nin strength and activity; but their boisterous mirth gives me great\r\nimpatience for the return of such happiness as I enjoyed in a\r\nconversation last week. Among others in that company, we had Florio, who\r\nnever interrupted any man living when he was speaking, or ever ceased to\r\nspeak, but others lamented that he had done. His discourse ever arises\r\nfrom a fulness of the matter before him, and not from ostentation or\r\ntriumph of his understanding; for though he seldom delivers what he need\r\nfear being repeated, he speaks without having that end in view; and his\r\nforbearance of calumny or bitterness, is owing rather to his good nature\r\nthan his discretion; for which reason, he is esteemed a gentleman\r\nperfectly qualified for conversation, in whom a general goodwill to\r\nmankind takes off the necessity of caution and circumspection. We had\r\nat the same time that evening the best sort of companion that can be, a\r\ngood-natured old man. This person meets in the company of young men,\r\nveneration for his benevolence, and is not only valued for the good\r\nqualities of which he is master, but reaps an acceptance from the pardon\r\nhe gives to other men's faults: and the ingenuous sort of men with whom\r\nhe converses, have so just a regard for him, that he rather is an\r\nexample, than a check to their behaviour. For this reason, as Senecio\r\nnever pretends to be a man of pleasure before youth, so young men never\r\nset up for wisdom before Senecio; so that you never meet, where he is,\r\nthose monsters of conversation, who are grave or gay above their years.\r\nHe never converses but with followers of nature and good sense, where\r\nall that is uttered is only the effect of a communicable temper, and not\r\nof emulation to excel their companions; all desire of superiority being\r\na contradiction to that spirit which makes a just conversation, the very\r\nessence of which is mutual goodwill. Hence it is, that I take it for a\r\nrule, that the natural, and not the acquired man, is the companion.\r\nLearning, wit, gallantry, and good breeding, are all but subordinate\r\nqualities in society, and are of no value, but as they are subservient\r\nto benevolence, and tend to a certain manner of being or appearing equal\r\nto the rest of the company; for conversation is composed of an assembly\r\nof men, as they are men, and not as they are distinguished by fortune:\r\ntherefore he that brings his quality with him into conversation, should\r\nalways pay the reckoning; for he came to receive homage, and not to meet\r\nhis friends--But the din about my ears from the clamour of the people I\r\nwas with this evening, has carried me beyond my intended purpose, which\r\nwas to explain upon the Order of Merry Fellows; but I think I may\r\npronounce of them, as I heard good Senecio, with a spice of wit of the\r\nlast age, say, viz. that a Merry Fellow is the Saddest Fellow in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 437: See No. 44.

That expectation cannot be raised too\r\nhigh for the novelty of the history, and manner of life, of the Emperor\r\nAurengezebe,[444] who has resided for some years in the cities of London\r\nand Westminster, with the air and mien indeed of his imperial quality,\r\nbut the equipage and appointment only of a private gentleman. This\r\npotentate, for a long series of time, appeared from the hour of twelve\r\ntill that of two at a coffee-house near the 'Change, and had a seat\r\n(though without a canopy) sacred to himself, where he gave diurnal\r\naudiences concerning commerce, politics, tare and tret, usury and\r\nabatement, with all things necessary for helping the distressed, who\r\nwere willing to give one limb for the better maintenance of the rest; or\r\nsuch joyous youths, whose philosophy is confined to the present hour,\r\nand were desirous to call in the revenue of next half-year to double the\r\nenjoyment of this. Long did this growing monarch employ himself after\r\nthis manner: and as alliances are necessary to all great kingdoms, he\r\ntook particularly the interests of Lewis XIV. into his care and\r\nprotection. When all mankind were attacking that unhappy monarch, and\r\nthose who had neither valour nor wit to oppose against him would be\r\nstill showing their impotent malice by laying wagers in opposition to\r\nhis interests, Aurengezebe ever took the part of his contemporary, and\r\nlaid immense treasures on his side in defence of his important magazine\r\nof Toulon. Aurengezebe also had all this while a constant intelligence\r\nwith India, and his letters were answered in jewels, which he soon made\r\nbrilliant, and caused to be affixed to his imperial castor, which he\r\nalways wears cocked in front, to show his defiance; with a heap of\r\nimperial snuff in the middle of his ample visage, to show his sagacity.\r\nThe zealots for this little spot called Great Britain fell universally\r\ninto this emperor's policies, and paid homage to his superior genius, in\r\nforfeiting their coffers to his treasury: but wealth and wisdom are\r\npossessions too solemn not to give weariness to active minds, without\r\nthe relief (in vacant hours) of wit and love, which are the proper\r\namusements of the powerful and the wise: this emperor therefore, with\r\ngreat regularity, every day at five in the afternoon, leaves his\r\nmoney-changers, his publicans, and little hoarders of wealth, to their\r\nlow pursuits, and ascends his chariot to drive to Will's; where the\r\ntaste is refined, and a relish given to men's possessions, by a polite\r\nskill in gratifying their passions and appetites. There it is that the\r\nemperor has learned to live and to love, and not, like a miser, to gaze\r\nonly on his ingots or his treasures; but with a nobler satisfaction, to\r\nlive the admiration of others, for his splendour and happiness in being\r\nmaster of them. But a prince is no more to be his own caterer in his\r\nlove, than in his food; therefore Aurengezebe has ever in waiting two\r\npurveyors for his dishes, and his wenches for his retired hours, by whom\r\nthe scene of his diversion is prepared in the following manner:\r\n\r\nThere is near Covent Garden a street known by the name of Drury, which,\r\nbefore the days of Christianity, was purchased by the Queen of Paphos,\r\nand is the only part of Great Britain where the tenure of vassalage is\r\nstill in being. All that long course of building is under particular\r\ndistricts or ladyships, after the manner of lordships in other parts,\r\nover which matrons of known abilities preside, and have, for the support\r\nof their age and infirmities, certain taxes paid out of the rewards for\r\nthe amorous labours of the young. This seraglio of Great Britain is\r\ndisposed into convenient alleys and apartments, and every house, from\r\nthe cellar to the garret, inhabited by nymphs of different orders, that\r\npersons of every rank may be accommodated with an immediate consort, to\r\nallay their flames, and partake of their cares. Here it is, that when\r\nAurengezebe thinks fit to give a loose to dalliance, the purveyors\r\nprepare the entertainments; and what makes it more august is, that every\r\nperson concerned in the interlude has his set part, and the prince sends\r\nbeforehand word what he designs to say, and directs also the very answer\r\nwhich shall be made to him.\r\n\r\nIt has been before hinted, that this emperor has a continual commerce\r\nwith India; and it is to be noted, that the largest stone that rich\r\nearth has produced, is in our Aurengezebe's possession.\r\n\r\nBut all things are now disposed for his reception. At his entrance into\r\nthe seraglio, a servant delivers him his bever of state and love, on\r\nwhich is fixed this inestimable jewel as his diadem. When he is seated,\r\nthe purveyors, Pandarus and Nuncio, marching on each side of the matron\r\nof the house, introduce her into his presence. In the midst of the room,\r\nthey bow altogether to the diadem.\r\n\r\nWhen the matron:\r\n\r\n\"Whoever thou art (as thy awful aspect speaks thee a man of power), be\r\npropitious to this mansion of love, and let not the severity of thy\r\nwisdom disdain, that by the representation of naked innocence, or\r\npastoral figures, we revive in thee the memory at least of that power of\r\nVenus, to which all the wise and the brave are some part of their lives\r\ndevoted.\" Aurengezebe consents by a nod, and they go out backward.\r\n\r\nAfter this, an unhappy nymph, who is to be supposed just escaped from\r\nthe hands of a ravisher, with her tresses dishevelled, runs into the\r\nroom with a dagger in her hand, and falls before the emperor.\r\n\r\n\"Pity, oh! pity! whoever thou art, an unhappy virgin, whom one of thy\r\ntrain has robbed of her innocence; her innocence, which was all her\r\nportion--Or rather, let me die like the memorable Lucretia--\" Upon which\r\nshe stabs herself. The body is immediately examined after the manner of\r\nour coroners. Lucretia recovers by a cup of right Nantes; and the\r\nmatron, who is her next relation, stops all process at law.\r\n\r\nThis unhappy affair is no sooner over, but a naked mad woman breaks into\r\nthe room, calls for her duke, her lord, her emperor. As soon as she\r\nspies Aurengezebe, the object of all her fury and love, she calls for\r\npetticoats, is ready to sink with shame, and is dressed in all haste in\r\nnew attire at his charge. This unexpected accident of the mad woman\r\nmakes Aurengezebe curious to know, whether others who are in their\r\nsenses can guess at his quality. For which reason the whole convent is\r\nexamined one by one. The matron marches in with a tawdry country girl:\r\n\"Pray, Winifred,\" says she, \"who do you think that fine man with those\r\njewels and pearls is?\" \"I believe,\" says Winifred, \"it is our landlord.\r\nIt must be the squire himself.\" The emperor laughs at her simplicity.\r\n\"Go, fool,\" says the matron: then turning to the emperor, \"Your\r\ngreatness will pardon her ignorance!\" After her, several others of\r\ndifferent characters are instructed to mistake who he is in the same\r\nmanner: then the whole sisterhood are called together, and the emperor\r\nrises, and cocking his hat, declares, he is the Great Mogul, and they\r\nhis concubines. A general murmur goes through the assembly, and\r\nAurengezebe certifying, that he keeps them for state rather than use,\r\ntells them, they are permitted to receive all men into their apartments;\r\nthen proceeds through the crowd, among whom he throws medals shaped like\r\nhalf-crowns, and returns to his chariot.\r\n\r\nThis being all that passed the last day in which Aurengezebe visited the\r\nwomen's apartments, I consulted Pacolet concerning the foundation of\r\nsuch strange amusements in old age: to which he answered; \"You may\r\nremember, when I gave you an account of my good fortune in being drowned\r\non the thirtieth day of my human life, I told you of the disasters I\r\nshould otherwise have met with before I arrived at the end of my stamen,\r\nwhich was sixty years. I may now add an observation to you, that all who\r\nexceed that period, except the latter part of it is spent in the\r\nexercise of virtue and contemplation of futurity, must necessarily fall\r\ninto an indecent old age, because, with regard to all the enjoyments of\r\nthe years of vigour and manhood, childhood returns upon them: and as\r\ninfants ride on sticks, build houses in dirt, and make ships in gutters,\r\nby a faint idea of things they are to act hereafter; so old men play the\r\nlovers, potentates, and emperors, from the decaying image of the more\r\nperfect performances of their stronger years: therefore be sure to\r\ninsert Æsculapius and Aurengezebe in your next bill of mortality of the\r\nmetaphorically defunct.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWill's Coffee-house, July 24.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I came hither this evening, no less than ten people produced\r\nthe following poem, which they all reported was sent to each of them by\r\nthe penny post from an unknown hand. All the battle-writers in the room\r\nwere in debate, who could be the author of a piece so martially written;\r\nand everybody applauded the address and skill of the author, in calling\r\nit a Postscript: it being the nature of a postscript to contain\r\nsomething very material which was forgotten, or not clearly expressed in\r\nthe letter itself. Thus, the verses being occasioned by a march without\r\nbeat of drum, and that circumstance being no ways taken notice of in any\r\nof the stanzas, the author calls it a postscript; not that it is a\r\npostscript, but figuratively, because it wants a postscript. Common\r\nwriters, when what they mean is not expressed in the book itself, supply\r\nit by a preface; but a postscript seems to me the more just way of\r\napology; because otherwise a man makes an excuse before the offence is\r\ncommitted. All the heroic poets were guessed at for its author; but\r\nthough we could not find out his name, yet one repeated a couplet in\r\n\"Hudibras\" which spoke his qualifications:\r\n\r\n    _\"I' th' midst of all this warlike rabble,\r\n    Crowdero marched, expert and able\"_[445]\r\n\r\nThe poem is admirably suited to the occasion: for to write without\r\ndiscovering your meaning, bears a just resemblance to marching without\r\nbeat of drum.\r\n\r\n#On the March to Tournay without Beat of Drum.#\r\n\r\n#The Brussels POSTSCRIPT.#[446]\r\n\r\n      Could I with plainest words express\r\n      That great man's wonderful address,\r\n    His penetration, and his towering thought;\r\n      It would the gazing world surprise,\r\n      To see one man at all times wise,\r\n    To view the wonders he with ease has wrought.\r\n\r\n      Refining schemes approach his mind,\r\n      Like breezes of a southern wind,\r\n    To temperate a sultry glorious day;\r\n      Whose fannings, with an useful pride,\r\n      Its mighty heat doth softly guide,\r\n    And having cleared the air, glide silently away.\r\n\r\n      Thus his immensity of thought\r\n      Is deeply formed, and gently wrought,\r\n    His temper always softening life's disease;\r\n      That Fortune, when she does intend\r\n      To rudely frown, she turns his friend,\r\n    Admires his judgment, and applauds his ease.\r\n\r\n    His great address in this design,\r\n      Does now, and will for ever shine,\r\n    And wants a Waller but to do him right:\r\n      The whole amusement was so strong,\r\n      Like fate he doomed them to be wrong,\r\n    And Tournay's took by a peculiar sleight.\r\n\r\n      Thus, madam, all mankind behold\r\n      Your vast ascendant, not by gold,\r\n    But by your wisdom, and your pious life;\r\n      Your aim no more than to destroy\r\n      That which does Europe's ease annoy,\r\n    And supersede a reign of shame and strife.\r\n\r\n\r\nSt. James's Coffee-house, July 24.\r\n\r\nMy brethren of the quill, the ingenious society of news-writers, having\r\nwith great spirit and elegance already informed the world, that the town\r\nof Tournay capitulated on the 28th instant, there is nothing left for me\r\nto say, but to congratulate the good company here, that we have reason\r\nto hope for an opportunity of thanking Mr. Withers[447] next winter in\r\nthis place, for the service he has done his country. No man deserves\r\nbetter of his friends than that gentleman, whose distinguishing\r\ncharacter it is, that he gives his orders with the familiarity, and\r\nenjoys his fortune with the generosity, of a fellow-soldier. His Grace\r\nthe Duke of Argyle had also an eminent part in the reduction of this\r\nimportant place. That illustrious youth[448] discovers the peculiar\r\nturn of spirit and greatness of soul which only make men of high birth\r\nand quality useful to their country; and considers nobility as an\r\nimaginary distinction, unless accompanied with the practice of those\r\ngenerous virtues by which it ought to be obtained. But[449] that our\r\nmilitary glory is arrived at its present height, and that men of all\r\nranks so passionately affect their share in it, is certainly owing to\r\nthe merit and conduct of our glorious general; for as the great secret\r\nin chemistry, though not in nature, has occasioned many useful\r\ndiscoveries; and the fantastic notion of being wholly disinterested in\r\nfriendship, has made men do a thousand generous actions above\r\nthemselves; so, though the present grandeur and fame of the Duke of\r\nMarlborough is a station of glory to which no one hopes to arrive, yet\r\nall carry their actions to a higher pitch, by having that great example\r\nlaid before them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 444: \"Aurenzeb is Tom Colson, who never had any friendship\r\nwith anybody but S'r Edward Seymour, who brought him into Parliament\"\r\n(Peter Wentworth to Lord Raby, 29 July 1709; \"Wentworth Papers,\" p. 97).\r\nThomas Coulson was elected M.P. for Totnes, with Sir Edward Seymour,\r\nBart., in 1698.

But if people will indulge\r\na splenetic humour, it is impossible to be at ease, when such creatures\r\nas are the scandal of our species, set up for gallantry and adventures.\r\nIt will be much more easy therefore to laugh him into reason, than\r\nconvert him from his foppery by any serious contempt. I knew a gentleman\r\nthat made it a maxim to open his doors, and ever run into the way of\r\nbullies, to avoid their insolence. The rule will hold as well with\r\ncoxcombs: they are never mortified, but when they see you receive, and\r\ndespise them; otherwise they rest assured, that it is your ignorance\r\nmakes them out of your good graces; or, that it is only want of\r\nadmittance prevents their being amiable where they are shunned and\r\navoided. But Sir Taffety is a fop of so sanguine complexion, that I fear\r\nit will be very hard for the fair one he at present pursues to get rid\r\nof the chase, without being so tired, as for her own ease to fall into\r\nthe mouth of the mongrel she runs from. But the history of Sir Taffety\r\nis as pleasant as his character. It happened, that when he first set up\r\nfor a fortune-hunter, he chose Tunbridge for the scene of action; where\r\nwere at that time two sisters upon the same design. The knight believed\r\nof course the elder must be the better prize; and consequently makes all\r\nhis sail that way. People that want sense, do always in an egregious\r\nmanner want modesty, which made our hero triumph in making his amour as\r\npublic as was possible. The adored lady was no less vain of his public\r\naddresses. An attorney with one cause is not half so restless as a woman\r\nwith one lover. Wherever they met, they talked to each other aloud,\r\nchose each other partner at balls, saluted at the most conspicuous parts\r\nof the service at church, and practised in honour of each other all the\r\nremarkable particularities which are usual for persons who admire one\r\nanother, and are contemptible to the rest of the world. These two lovers\r\nseemed as much made for each other as Adam and Eve, and all pronounced\r\nit a match of Nature's own making; but the night before the nuptials (so\r\nuniversally approved), the younger sister, envious of the good fortune\r\neven of her sister, who had been present at most of their interviews,\r\nand had an equal taste for the charms of a fop (as there are a set of\r\nwomen made for that order of men); the younger, I say, unable to see so\r\nrich a prize pass by her, discovered to Sir Taffety, that a coquette\r\nair, much tongue, and three suits, was all the portion of his mistress.\r\nHis love vanished that moment, himself and equipage the next morning. It\r\nis uncertain where the lover has been ever since engaged; but certain it\r\nis, he has not appeared in his character as a follower of love and\r\nfortune till he arrived at Epsom, where there is at present a young lady\r\nof youth, beauty, and fortune, who has alarmed[453] all the vain and the\r\nimpertinent to infest that quarter. At the head of this assembly, Sir\r\nTaffety shines in the brightest manner, with all the accomplishments\r\nwhich usually ensnare the heart of woman; with this particular merit\r\n(which often is of great service), that he is laughed at for her sake.\r\nThe friends of the fair one are in much pain for the sufferings she goes\r\nthrough from the perseverance of this hero; but they may be much more so\r\nfrom the danger of his succeeding, toward which they give him a helping\r\nhand, if they dissuade her with bitterness; for there is a fantastical\r\ngenerosity in the sex, to approve creatures of the least merit\r\nimaginable, when they see the imperfections of their admirers are become\r\nthe marks of derision for their sakes; and there is nothing so frequent,\r\nas that he who was contemptible to a woman in her own judgment, has won\r\nher by being too violently opposed by others.\r\n\r\n\r\nGrecian Coffee-house, July 27.\r\n\r\nIn the several capacities I bear, of astrologer, civilian, and\r\nphysician, I have with great application studied the public emolument:\r\nto this end serve all my lucubrations, speculations, and whatever other\r\nlabours I undertake, whether nocturnal or diurnal. On this motive am I\r\ninduced to publish a never-failing medicine for the spleen: my\r\nexperience in this distemper came from a very remarkable cure on my ever\r\nworthy friend Tom Spindle,[454] who, through excessive gaiety, had\r\nexhausted that natural stock of wit and spirits he had long been blessed\r\nwith: he was sunk and flattened to the lowest degree imaginable, sitting\r\nwhole hours over the \"Book of Martyrs,\" and \"Pilgrim's Progress\"; his\r\nother contemplations never rising higher than the colour of his urine,\r\nor regularity of his pulse. In this condition I found him, accompanied\r\nby the learned Dr. Drachm, and a good old nurse. Drachm had prescribed\r\nmagazines of herbs, and mines of steel. I soon discovered the malady,\r\nand descanted on the nature of it, till I convinced both the patient and\r\nhis nurse, that the spleen is not to be cured by medicine, but by\r\npoetry. Apollo, the author of physic, shone with diffusive rays the best\r\nof poets as well as of physicians; and it is in this double capacity\r\nthat I have made my way, and have found, sweet, easy, flowering numbers,\r\nare oft superior to our noblest medicines. When the spirits are low, and\r\nnature sunk, the muse, with sprightly and harmonious notes, gives an\r\nunexpected turn with a grain of poetry, which I prepare without the use\r\nof mercury. I have done wonders in this kind; for the spleen is like the\r\ntarantula,[455] the effects of whose malignant poison are to be\r\nprevented by no other remedy but the charms of music: for you are to\r\nunderstand, that as some noxious animals carry antidotes for their own\r\npoisons; so there is something equally unaccountable in poetry: for\r\nthough it is sometimes a disease, it is to be cured only by itself. Now\r\nI knowing Tom Spindle's constitution, and that he is not only a pretty\r\ngentleman, but also a pretty poet, found the true cause of his distemper\r\nwas a violent grief that moved his affections too strongly: for during\r\nthe late Treaty of Peace, he had written a most excellent poem on that\r\nsubject; and when he wanted but two lines in the last stanza for\r\nfinishing the whole piece, there comes news that the French tyrant would\r\nnot sign. Spindle in few days took his bed, and had lain there still,\r\nhad not I been sent for. I immediately told him, there was great\r\nprobability the French would now sue to us for peace. I saw immediately\r\na new life in his eyes; and knew, that nothing could help him forward\r\nso well, as hearing verses which he would believe worse than his own; I\r\nread him therefore the \"Brussels Postscript\";[456] after which I recited\r\nsome heroic lines of my own, which operated so strongly on the tympanum\r\nof his ear, that I doubt not but I have kept out all other sounds for a\r\nfortnight; and have reason to hope, we shall see him abroad the day\r\nbefore his poem. This you see, is a particular secret I have found out,\r\nviz., that you are not to choose your physician for his knowledge in\r\nyour distemper, but for having it himself. Therefore I am at hand for\r\nall maladies arising from poetical vapours, beyond which I never\r\npretend. For being called the other day to one in love, I took indeed\r\ntheir three guineas, and gave them my advice; which was, to send for\r\nÆsculapius.[457] Æsculapius, as soon as he saw the patient, cries out,\r\n\"'Tis love! 'tis love! Oh! the unequal pulse! these are the symptoms a\r\nlover feels; such sighs, such pangs, attend the uneasy mind; nor can our\r\nart, or all our boasted skill, avail--Yet O fair! for thee--\" Thus the\r\nsage ran on, and owned the passion which he pitied, as well as that he\r\nfelt a greater pain than ever he cured. After which he concluded, \"All I\r\ncan advise, is marriage: charms and beauty will give new life and\r\nvigour, and turn the course of nature to its better prospect.\" This is\r\nthe new way; and thus Æsculapius has left his beloved powders, and\r\nwrites a recipe for a wife at sixty. In short, my friend followed the\r\nprescription, and married youth and beauty in its perfect bloom.\r\n\r\n    _Supine in Silvia's snowy arms he lies,\r\n    And all the busy care of life defies:\r\n    Each happy hour is filled with fresh delight,\r\n    While peace the day, and pleasure crowns the night._\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom my own Apartment, July 27.\r\n\r\nTragical passion was the subject of the discourse where I last visited\r\nthis evening; and a gentleman who knows that I am at present writing a\r\nvery deep tragedy, directed his discourse in a particular manner to me.\r\n\"It is the common fault,\" said he, \"of you, gentlemen, who write in the\r\nbuskin style, that you give us rather the sentiments of such who behold\r\ntragical events, than of such who bear a part in them themselves. I\r\nwould advise all who pretend this way, to read Shakespeare with care,\r\nand they will soon be deterred from putting forth what is usually called\r\n'tragedy.' The way of common writers in this kind, is rather the\r\ndescription, than the expression of sorrow. There is no medium in these\r\nattempts; and you must go to the very bottom of the heart, or it is all\r\nmere language; and the writer of such lines is no more a poet, than a\r\nman is a physician for knowing the names of distempers, without the\r\ncauses of them. Men of sense are professed enemies to all such empty\r\nlabours: for he who pretends to be sorrowful, and is not, is a wretch\r\nyet more contemptible than he who pretends to be merry, and is not. Such\r\na tragedian is only maudlin drunk.\" The gentleman went on with much\r\nwarmth; but all he could say had little effect upon me: but when I came\r\nhither, I so far observed his counsel, that I looked into Shakespeare.\r\nThe tragedy I dipped into was, \"Harry the Fourth.\" In the scene where\r\nMorton is preparing to tell Northumberland of his son's death, the old\r\nman does not give him time to speak, but says,\r\n\r\n    \"_The whiteness of thy cheeks\r\n    Is apter than thy tongue to tell thy errand;\r\n    Even such a man, so faint, so spiritless,\r\n    So dull, so dead in look, so woebegone,\r\n    Drew Priam's curtain at the dead of night,\r\n    And would have told him half his Troy was burnt:\r\n    But Priam found the fire, ere he his tongue,\r\n    And I my Percy's death ere thou reportest it_\"[458]\r\n\r\nThe image in this place is wonderfully noble and great; yet this man in\r\nall this is but rising towards his great affliction, and is still enough\r\nhimself, as you see, to make a simile: but when he is certain of his\r\nson's death, he is lost to all patience, and gives up all the regards of\r\nthis life; and since the last of evils is fallen upon him, he calls for\r\nit upon all the world.\r\n\r\n      \"_Now let not Nature's hand\r\n    Keep the wild flood confined; let Order die,\r\n    And let the world no longer be a stage,\r\n    To feed contention in a lingering act;\r\n    But let one spirit of the firstborn Cain\r\n    Reign in all bosoms, that each heart being set\r\n    On bloody courses, the wide scene may end,\r\n    And darkness be the burier of the dead_.\"\r\n\r\nReading but this one scene has convinced me, that he who describes the\r\nconcern of great men, must have a soul as noble, and as susceptible of\r\nhigh thoughts, as they whom he represents: I shall therefore lay by my\r\ndrama for some time, and turn my thoughts to cares and griefs, somewhat\r\nbelow that of heroes, but no less moving. A misfortune proper for me to\r\ntake notice of, has too lately happened: the disconsolate Maria[459] has\r\nthree days kept her chamber for the loss of the beauteous Fidelia, her\r\nlap-dog. Lesbia herself[460] did not shed more tears for her sparrow.\r\nWhat makes her the more concerned, is, that we know not whether Fidelia\r\nwas killed or stolen; but she was seen in the parlour window when the\r\ntrain-bands went by, and never since. Whoever gives notice of her, dead\r\nor alive, shall be rewarded with a kiss of her lady.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 450: See No. 16.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 451: Intercourse.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 452: Henry Cromwell (died 1728) was a correspondent of Pope's,\r\nand a friend of Wycherley's. \"I cannot choose,\" wrote Mrs. Elizabeth\r\nThomas, \"but be pleased with the conquest of a person whose fame our\r\nincomparable Tatler has rendered immortal, by the three distinguishing\r\ntitles of 'Squire Easy the amorous bard'; 'Sir Timothy the critic'; and\r\n'Sir Taffety Trippet the fortune-hunter'\" (\"Pylades and Corinna,\" i. 96,\r\n194).

[STEELE.\r\n\r\nFrom _Thursday, July 28_, to _Saturday, July 30_, 1709.\r\n\r\n    --Virtutem verba putant, et\r\n    Lucum ligna.\r\n                                            HOR., 1 Ep. vi. 31.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom my own Apartment, July 29.\r\n\r\nThis day I obliged Pacolet to entertain me with matters which regarded\r\npersons of his own character and occupation. We chose to take our walk\r\non Tower Hill; and as we were coming from thence in order to stroll as\r\nfar as Garraway's,[461] I observed two men, who had but just landed,\r\ncoming from the waterside. I thought there was something uncommon in\r\ntheir mien and aspect; but though they seemed by their visage to be\r\nrelated, yet was there a warmth in their manner, as if they differed\r\nvery much in their sentiments of the subject on which they were talking.\r\nOne of them seemed to have a natural confidence, mixed with an ingenious\r\nfreedom in his gesture, his dress very plain, but very graceful and\r\nbecoming: the other, in the midst of an overbearing carriage, betrayed\r\n(by frequently looking round him) a suspicion that he was not enough\r\nregarded by those he met, or that he feared they would make some attack\r\nupon him. This person was much taller than his companion, and added to\r\nthat height the advantage of a feather in his hat, and heels to his\r\nshoes so monstrously high, that he had three or four times fallen down,\r\nhad he not been supported by his friend. They made a full stop as they\r\ncame within a few yards of the place where we stood. The plain gentleman\r\nbowed to Pacolet; the other looked on him with some displeasure: upon\r\nwhich I asked him, who they both were, when he thus informed me of their\r\npersons and circumstances.\r\n\r\n\"You may remember, Mr. Isaac, that I have often told you, there are\r\nbeings of a superior rank to mankind, who frequently visit the\r\nhabitations of men, in order to call them from some wrong pursuits in\r\nwhich they are actually engaged, or divert them from methods which will\r\nlead them into errors for the future. He that will carefully reflect\r\nupon the occurrences of his life, will find he has been sometimes\r\nextricated out of difficulties, and received favours where he could\r\nnever have expected such benefits; as well as met with cross events from\r\nsome unseen hand, which have disappointed his best laid designs. Such\r\naccidents arrive from the interventions of aërial beings, as they are\r\nbenevolent or hurtful to the nature of man, and attend his steps in the\r\ntracts of ambition, of business, and of pleasure. Before I ever appeared\r\nto you in the manner I do now, I have frequently followed you in your\r\nevening walks, and have often, by throwing some accident in your way, as\r\nthe passing by of a funeral, or the appearance of some other solemn\r\nobject, given your imagination a new turn, and changed a night you had\r\ndestined to mirth and jollity, into an exercise of study and\r\ncontemplation. I was the old soldier who met you last summer in Chelsea\r\nFields, and pretended that I had broken my wooden leg, and could not get\r\nhome; but I snapped it short off on purpose, that you might fall into\r\nthe reflections you did on that subject, and take me into your hack. If\r\nyou remember, you made yourself very merry on that fracture, and asked\r\nme, whether I thought I should next winter feel cold in the toes of that\r\nleg? As is usually observed, that those who lose limbs, are sensible of\r\npains in the extreme parts, even after those limbs are cut off. However,\r\nmy keeping you then in the story of the battle of the Boyne, prevented\r\nan assignation, which would have led you into more disasters than I then\r\nrelated.\r\n\r\n\"To be short; those two persons you see yonder, are such as I am; they\r\nare not real men, but are mere shades and figures: one is named Alethes;\r\nthe other, Verisimilis. Their office is to be the guardians and\r\nrepresentatives of Conscience and Honour. They are now going to visit\r\nthe several parts of the town, to see how their interests in the world\r\ndecay or flourish, and to purge themselves from the many false\r\nimputations they daily meet with in the commerce and conversation of\r\nmen. You observed Verisimilis frowned when he first saw me. What he is\r\nprovoked at, is, that I told him one day, though he strutted and dressed\r\nwith so much ostentation, if he kept himself within his own bounds, he\r\nwas but a lackey, and wore only that gentleman's livery whom he is now\r\nwith. This frets him to the heart; for you must know, he has pretended a\r\nlong time to set up for himself, and gets among a crowd of the more\r\nunthinking part of mankind, who take him for a person of the first\r\nquality; though his introduction into the world was wholly owing to his\r\npresent companion.\"\r\n\r\nThis encounter was very agreeable to me, and I was resolved to dog\r\nthem, and desired Pacolet to accompany me. I soon perceived what he told\r\nme in the gesture of the persons: for when they looked at each other in\r\ndiscourse, the well-dressed man suddenly cast down his eyes, and\r\ndiscovered that the other had a painful superiority over him. After some\r\nfurther discourse, they took leave. The plain gentleman went down\r\ntowards Thames Street, in order to be present, at least, at the oaths\r\ntaken at the Custom-house; and the other made directly for the heart of\r\nthe city. It is incredible how great a change there immediately appeared\r\nin the man of honour when he got rid of his uneasy companion: he\r\nadjusted the cock of his hat anew, settled his sword-knot, and had an\r\nappearance that attracted a sudden inclination for him and his interests\r\nin all who beheld him. \"For my part,\" said I to Pacolet, \"I cannot but\r\nthink you are mistaken in calling this person, of the lower quality; for\r\nhe looks much more like a gentleman than the other. Don't you observe\r\nall eyes are upon him as he advances: how each sex gazes at his stature,\r\naspect, address, and motion?\" Pacolet only smiled, and shaked his head;\r\nas leaving me to be convinced by my own further observation. We kept on\r\nour way after him till we came to Exchange Alley, where the plain\r\ngentleman again came up to the other; and they stood together after the\r\nmanner of eminent merchants, as if ready to receive application; but I\r\ncould observe no man talk to either of them. The one was laughed at as a\r\nfop; and I heard many whispers against the other, as a whimsical sort of\r\nfellow, and a great enemy to trade. They crossed Cornhill together, and\r\ncame into the full 'Change, where some bowed, and gave themselves airs\r\nin being known to so fine a man as Verisimilis, who, they said, had\r\ngreat interests in all princes' courts; and the other was taken notice\r\nof by several as one they had seen somewhere long before. One more\r\nparticularly said, he had formerly been a man of consideration in the\r\nworld; but was so unlucky, that they who dealt with him, by some strange\r\ninfatuation or other, had a way of cutting off their own bills, and were\r\nprodigiously slow in improving their stock. But as much as I was curious\r\nto observe the reception these gentlemen met with upon 'Change, I could\r\nnot help being interrupted by one that came up towards us, to whom\r\neverybody made their compliments. He was of the common height, and in\r\nhis dress there seemed to be great care to appear no way particular,\r\nexcept in a certain exact and feat[462] manner of behaviour and\r\ncircumspection. He was wonderfully careful that his shoes and clothes\r\nshould be without the least speck upon them; and seemed to think, that\r\non such an accident depended his very life and fortune. There was hardly\r\na man on 'Change who had not a note upon him; and each seemed very well\r\nsatisfied that their money lay in his hands, without demanding payment.\r\nI asked Pacolet, what great merchant that was, who was so universally\r\naddressed to, yet made too familiar an appearance to command that\r\nextraordinary deference? Pacolet answered, \"This person is the demon or\r\ngenius of credit: his name is Umbra. If you observe, he follows Alethes\r\nand Verisimilis at a distance; and indeed has no foundation for the\r\nfigure he makes in the world, but that he is thought to keep their cash;\r\nthough at the same time, none who trust him would trust the others for a\r\ngroat.\" As the company rolled about, the three spectres were jumbled\r\ninto one place: when they were so, and all thought there was an alliance\r\nbetween them, they immediately drew upon them the business of the whole\r\n'Change. But their affairs soon increased to such an unwieldy bulk, that\r\nAlethes took his leave, and said, he would not engage further than he\r\nhad an immediate fund to answer. Verisimilis pretended that though he\r\nhad revenues large enough to go on his own bottom, yet it was below one\r\nof his family to condescend to trade in his own name; therefore he also\r\nretired. I was extremely troubled to see the glorious mart of London\r\nleft with no other guardian, but him of credit. But Pacolet told me,\r\nthat traders had nothing to do with the honour or conscience of their\r\ncorrespondents, provided they supported a general behaviour in the\r\nworld, which could not hurt their credit or their purses: \"for,\" said\r\nhe, \"you may in this one tract of building of London and Westminster see\r\nthe imaginary motives on which the greatest affairs move, as well as in\r\nrambling over the face of the earth. For though Alethes is the real\r\ngovernor, as well as legislator of mankind, he has very little business\r\nbut to make up quarrels, and is only a general referee, to whom every\r\nman pretends to appeal; but is satisfied with his determinations no\r\nfurther than they promote his own interest. Hence it is, that the\r\nsoldier and the courtier model their actions according to Verisimilis'\r\nmanner, and the merchant according to that of Umbra. Among these men,\r\nhonour and credit are not valuable possessions in themselves, or pursued\r\nout of a principle of justice; but merely as they are serviceable to\r\nambition and to commerce. But the world will never be in any manner of\r\norder or tranquillity, till men are firmly convinced, that conscience,\r\nhonour, and credit, are all in one interest; and that without the\r\nconcurrence of the former, the latter are but impositions upon ourselves\r\nand others. The force these delusive words have, is not seen in the\r\ntransactions of the busy world only, but also have their tyranny over\r\nthe fair sex. Were you to ask the unhappy Lais, what pangs of\r\nreflection, preferring the consideration of her honour to her\r\nconscience, has given her? She could tell you, that it has forced her to\r\ndrink up half a gallon this winter of Tom Dassapas' potions; that she\r\nstill pines away for fear of being a mother; and knows not, but the\r\nmoment she is such, she shall be a murderess: but if conscience had as\r\nstrong a force upon the mind, as honour, the first step to her unhappy\r\ncondition had never been made; she had still been innocent, as she's\r\nbeautiful. Were men so enlightened and studious of their own good, as to\r\nact by the dictates of their reason and reflection, and not the opinion\r\nof others, Conscience would be the steady ruler of human life; and the\r\nwords, Truth, Law, Reason, Equity, and Religion, would be but synonymous\r\nterms for that only guide which makes us pass our days in our own favour\r\nand approbation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 461: A coffee-house in Exchange Alley, Cornhill, with an\r\nauction-room on the first floor, where wine and other things were sold\r\n(see No, 147).

[STEELE.\r\n\r\nFrom _Saturday, July 30_, to _Tuesday, August 2, 1709._\r\n\r\n    Quicquid agunt homines ... nostri farrago libelli.\r\n                                            JUV., Sat. i. 85, 86.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nWhite's Chocolate-house, August 1.\r\n\r\nThe imposition of honest names and words upon improper subjects, has\r\nmade so regular a confusion amongst us, that we are apt to sit down with\r\nour errors, well enough satisfied with the methods we are fallen into,\r\nwithout attempting to deliver ourselves from the tyranny under which we\r\nare reduced by such innovations. Of all the laudable motives of human\r\nlife, none has suffered so much in this kind as love; under which\r\nrevered name, a brutal desire called lust is frequently concealed and\r\nadmitted; though they differ as much as a matron from a prostitute, or a\r\ncompanion from a buffoon. Philander[463] the other day was bewailing\r\nthis misfortune with much indignation, and upbraided me for having some\r\ntime since quoted those excellent lines of the satirist:\r\n\r\n    _To an exact perfection they have brought\r\n    The action love, the passion is forgot._[464]\r\n\r\n\"How could you,\" said he, \"leave such a hint so coldly? How could\r\nAspasia[465] and Sempronia[466] enter into your imagination at the same\r\ntime, and you never declare to us the different reception you gave them?\r\nThe figures which the ancient mythologists and poets put upon love and\r\nlust in their writings, are very instructive. Love is a beauteous blind\r\nchild, adorned with a quiver and a bow, which he plays with, and shoots\r\naround him, without design or direction; to intimate to us, that the\r\nperson beloved has no intention to give us the anxieties we meet with;\r\nbut that the beauties of a worthy object are like the charms of a lovely\r\ninfant: they cannot but attract your concern and fondness, though the\r\nchild so regarded is as insensible of the value you put upon it, as it\r\nis that it deserves your benevolence. On the other side, the sages\r\nfigured Lust in the form of a satyr; of shape, part human, part bestial;\r\nto signify, that the followers of it prostitute the reason of a man to\r\npursue the appetites of a beast. This satyr is made to haunt the paths\r\nand coverts of the wood-nymphs and shepherdesses, to lurk on the banks\r\nof rivulets, and watch the purling streams (as the resorts of retired\r\nvirgins), to show, that lawless desire tends chiefly to prey upon\r\ninnocence, and has something so unnatural in it, that it hates its own\r\nmake, and shuns the object it loved, as soon as it has made it like\r\nitself. Love therefore is a child that complains and bewails its\r\ninability to help itself, and weeps for assistance, without an immediate\r\nreflection of knowledge of the food it wants: Lust, a watchful thief\r\nwhich seizes its prey, and lays snares for its own relief; and its\r\nprincipal object being innocence, it never robs, but it murders at the\r\nsame time. From this idea of a Cupid and a Satyr, we may settle our\r\nnotion of these different desires, and accordingly rank their followers.\r\nAspasia must therefore be allowed to be the first of the beauteous Order\r\nof Love, whose unaffected freedom, and conscious innocence, give her the\r\nattendance of the graces in all her actions. That awful distance which\r\nwe bear towards her in all our thoughts of her, and that cheerful\r\nfamiliarity with which we approach her, are certain instances of her\r\nbeing the truest object of love of any of her sex. In this accomplished\r\nlady, love is the constant effect, because it is never the design. Yet,\r\nthough her mien carries much more invitation than command, to behold her\r\nis an immediate check to loose behaviour; and to love her is a liberal\r\neducation:[467] for, it being the nature of all love to create an\r\nimitation of the beloved person in the lover, a regard for Aspasia\r\nnaturally produces decency of manners, and good conduct of life in her\r\nadmirers. If therefore the giggling Lucippe could but see her train of\r\nfops assembled, and Aspasia move by them, she would be mortified at the\r\nveneration with which she is beheld, even by Lucippe's own unthinking\r\nequipage, whose passions have long taken leave of their understandings.\r\nBut as charity is esteemed a conjunction of the good qualities necessary\r\nto a virtuous man, so love is the happy composition of all the\r\naccomplishments that make a fine gentleman. The motive of a man's life\r\nis seen in all his actions; and such as have the beauteous boy for their\r\ninspirer have a simplicity of behaviour, and a certain evenness of\r\ndesire, which burns like the lamp of life in their bosoms; while they\r\nwho are instigated by the satyr are ever tortured by jealousies of the\r\nobject of their wishes; often desire what they scorn, and as often\r\nconsciously and knowingly embrace where they are mutually indifferent.\r\n\r\nFlorio, the generous husband, and Limberham, the \"kind keeper,\"[468] are\r\nnoted examples of the different effects which these desires produce in\r\nthe mind. Amanda, who is the wife of Florio, lives in the continual\r\nenjoyment of new instances of her husband's friendship, and sees it the\r\nend of all his ambition to make her life one series of pleasure and\r\nsatisfaction; and Amanda's relish of the goods of life, is all that\r\nmakes them pleasing to Florio: they behave themselves to each other when\r\npresent with a certain apparent benevolence, which transports above\r\nrapture; and they think of each other in absence with a confidence\r\nunknown to the highest friendship: their satisfactions are doubled,\r\ntheir sorrows lessened by participation. On the other hand, Corinna, who\r\nis the mistress of Limberham,[469] lives in constant torment: her\r\nequipage is, an old woman, who was what Corinna is now; an antiquated\r\nfootman, who was pimp to Limberham's father; and a chambermaid, who is\r\nLimberham's wench by fits, out of a principle of politics to make her\r\njealous and watchful of Corinna. Under this guard, and in this\r\nconversation, Corinna lives in state: the furniture of her habitation,\r\nand her own gorgeous dress, make her the envy of all the strolling\r\nladies in the town; but Corinna knows she herself is but part of\r\nLimberham's household stuff, and is as capable of being disposed of\r\nelsewhere, as any other movable. But while her keeper is persuaded by\r\nhis spies, that no enemy has been within his doors since his last visit,\r\nno Persian prince was ever so magnificently bountiful: a kind look or\r\nfalling tear is worth a piece of brocade, a sigh is a jewel, and a smile\r\nis a cupboard of plate. All this is shared between Corinna and her guard\r\nin his absence. With this great economy and industry does the unhappy\r\nLimberham purchase the constant tortures of jealousy, the favour of\r\nspending his estate, and the opportunity of enriching one by whom he\r\nknows he is hated and despised. These are the ordinary and common evils\r\nwhich attend keepers, and Corinna is a wench but of common size of\r\nwickedness. Were you to know what passes under the roof where the fair\r\nMessalina reigns with her humble adorer! Messalina is the professed\r\nmistress of mankind; she has left the bed of her husband and her\r\nbeauteous offspring, to give a loose to want of shame and fulness of\r\ndesire. Wretched Nocturnus, her feeble keeper! How the poor creature\r\nfribbles in his gait, and scuttles from place to place to despatch his\r\nnecessary affairs in painful daylight, that he may return to the\r\nconstant twilight preserved in that scene of wantonness, Messalina's\r\nbedchamber. How does he, while he is absent from thence, consider in his\r\nimagination the breadth of his porter's shoulders, the spruce nightcap\r\nof his valet, the ready attendance of his butler! Any of all whom he\r\nknows she admits, and professes to approve of. This, alas! is the\r\ngallantry; this the freedom of our fine gentlemen: for this they\r\npreserve their liberty, and keep clear of that bugbear, marriage. But he\r\ndoes not understand either vice or virtue, who will not allow, that life\r\nwithout the rules of morality is a wayward uneasy being, with snatches\r\nonly of pleasure; but under the regulation of virtue, a reasonable and\r\nuniform habit of enjoyment. I have seen in a play of old Heywood's, a\r\nspeech at the end of an act, which touched this point with much spirit.\r\nHe makes a married man in the play, upon some endearing occasion, look\r\nat his spouse with an air of fondness, and fall into the following\r\nreflection on his condition:\r\n\r\n    \"_O Marriage! happiest, easiest, safest state;\r\n    Let debauchees and drunkards scorn thy rights,\r\n    Who, in their nauseous draughts and lusts, profane\r\n    Both thee and Heaven by whom thou wert ordained.\r\n    How can the savage call it loss of freedom,\r\n    Thus to converse with, thus to gaze at\r\n    A faithful, beauteous friend?\r\n    Blush not, my fair one, that thy love applauds thee,\r\n    Nor be it painful to my wedded wife,\r\n    That my full heart overflows in praise of thee.\r\n    Thou art by law, by interest, passion, mine:\r\n    Passion and reason join in love of thee.\r\n    Thus, through a world of calumny and fraud,\r\n    We pass both unreproached, both undeceived;\r\n    While in each other's interest and happiness,\r\n    We without art all faculties employ,\r\n    And all our senses without guilt enjoy_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSt. James's Coffee-house August 1.\r\n\r\nLetters from the Hague of the 6th instant, N.S., say, that there daily\r\narrive at our camp deserters in considerable numbers; and that several\r\nof the enemy concealed themselves in the town of Tournay when the\r\ngarrison marched into the citadel; after which, they presented\r\nthemselves to the Duke of Marlborough; some of whom were commissioned\r\nofficers. The Earl of Albemarle is appointed governor of the town. Soon\r\nafter the surrender, there arose a dispute about a considerable work,\r\nwhich was asserted by the Allies to be part of the town, and by the\r\nFrench to belong to the citadel. It is said, Monsieur de Surville was so\r\ningenious as to declare, he thought it to be comprehended within the\r\nlimits of the town; but Monsieur de Mesgrigny, governor of the citadel,\r\nwas of a contrary opinion. It is reported, that this affair occasioned\r\ngreat difficulties, which ended in a capitulation for the citadel\r\nitself; the principal article of which is, that it shall be surrendered\r\non the 5th of September next, in case they are not in the meantime\r\nrelieved. This circumstance gives foundation to believe, that the enemy\r\nhave acted in this manner, rather from some hopes they conceive of a\r\ntreaty of peace before that time, than any expectation from their army,\r\nwhich has retired towards their former works between Lens and La Bassée.\r\nThese advices add, that his Excellency the Czarish Ambassador has\r\ncommunicated to the States-General, and the foreign Ministers residing\r\nat the Hague, a copy of a letter from his master's camp, which gives an\r\naccount of the entire defeat of the Swedish army. They further say, that\r\nCount Piper is taken prisoner, and that it is doubted whether the King\r\nof Sweden himself was not killed in the action. We hear from Savoy, that\r\nCount Thaun having amused the enemy by a march as far as the Tarantaise,\r\nhad suddenly repassed Mount Cenis, and moved towards Briançon. This\r\nunexpected disposition is apprehended by the enemy as a piece of the\r\nDuke of Savoy's dexterity; and the French adding this circumstance to\r\nthat of the Confederate squadron's lying before Toulon, convince\r\nthemselves, that his royal highness has his thoughts upon the execution\r\nof some great design in those parts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 463: See No. 13.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 464: See No. 5.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 465: Lady Elizabeth Hastings (see No. 42).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 466: See No. 33.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 467: In the _Spectator_ for March 29, 1884, Mr. Swinburne\r\npublished a letter saying that Steele was not the author of these famous\r\nwords,--\"the most exquisite tribute ever paid to the memory of a noble\r\nwoman\"; for the article in No. 42 was by Congreve.
