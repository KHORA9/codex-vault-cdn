I.--MARCH, 1862.--No. III.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSOUTHERN AIDS TO THE NORTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most difficult question at present before the American\r\npeople is that so often and so insolently put by Southern journals, and\r\nso ignorantly babbled in weak imitation of them by English newspapers,\r\nasking what, after all, in case of a victory, or even of many victories,\r\ncan we do with the revolted provinces? The British press, prompt to put\r\nthe worst construction on every hope of the Union, prophesies endless\r\nguerilla warfare,--a possibility which, like the blocking up of\r\nCharleston harbor by means of the stone fleet, is, of course, something\r\nwhich calls for the instant interference of all cotton-spinning\r\nChristian nations. Even among our own countrymen it must be confessed\r\nthere has been no little indecision as to the end and the means of\r\nsecuring the conquest of a country whose outlines are counted by\r\nthousands instead of hundreds of miles, and whose whole extent, it is\r\ntoo generally believed, forms a series of regions where dismal swamps,\r\nbayous, lagoons, dense forests, and all manner of impenetrabilities, bid\r\ndefiance to any save the natives, and where the most deadly fevers are\r\never being born in the jungles and wafted on the wings of every summer\r\nmorn over the whole plantation land. The truth is, that the simple facts\r\nand figures relative to this country are not generally known. Let the\r\nNorthern people but once learn the truths existing in their favor, and\r\nthere will be an end to this misapprehension. There has been thus far no\r\nhesitation or irresolution among the people in the conduct of the war.\r\n'Conquer them first,' has been the glorious war-cry from millions of the\r\nfreest men on earth. But when we are driving a nail it is well to know\r\nthat it will be possible to eventually clench it. And when the country\r\nshall fully understand the ease with which this Union nail may be\r\nclenched, there will be, let us hope, a greatly revived spirit in all\r\nnow interested in forwarding the war.\r\n\r\nIt is evident enough that if all the millions of the South remain united\r\nto the death in the cause of secession, little else than a guerilla\r\nwarfare of endless length is to be hoped for. The accounts of the\r\nenthusiasm and harmony at present prevailing in Eastern Virginia, and in\r\nother places controlled by the active secessionists, have struck terror\r\nto the hearts of many. But, united though they be, they must be more\r\nthan mortal if they could resist the influences of a counter-revolution,\r\nand of strong bodies of enemies in the heart of their country, aided by\r\na mighty foe without. 'Hercules was a strong man,' says the proverb,\r\n'but he could not pay money when he had none;' and the South may be\r\nstrong, but she can hardly fail to be entirely crippled when certain\r\nagencies shall be brought to bear against her. Let us examine them, and\r\nfind wherein her weakness consists.\r\n\r\nThe first is the easy possibility of a _counter-revolution_ among the\r\ninhabitants of the mountain districts, who hold but few slaves, who have\r\npreserved a devoted love for the Union, and who are, if not at positive\r\nfeud, at least on anything but social harmony with their aristocratic\r\nneighbors of the lowlands and of the plantation. Unlike the 'mean\r\nwhites' who live among slaves and slave-holders, and are virtually more\r\ndegraded than the blacks, these mountaineers are men of strong character\r\nand common-sense, combining the industrious disposition of the North\r\nwith the fierce pride of the South. And so numerous are they, and so\r\nwide is the range of country which they inhabit, that it would seem\r\nmiraculous if with their aid, and that of other causes which will be\r\nreferred to, a counter-revolution could not be established, which would\r\nsweep the slaveocracy from existence.\r\n\r\nIn a pamphlet entitled 'Alleghania,' by James W. Taylor, published at\r\nSaint Paul, Minnesota, by James Davenport, the reader will find 'a\r\ngeographical and statistical memoir, exhibiting the strength of the\r\nUnion, and the weakness of slavery in the mountain districts of the\r\nSouth,' which is well worth careful study at this crisis. Let the reader\r\ntake the map and trace on it the dark caterpillar-like lines of the\r\nAlleghanies from Pennsylvania southward. Not until he reaches Northern\r\nAlabama will he find its end. In these mountain districts which form\r\n'the Switzerland of the South,' a population exists on whom slavery has\r\nno hold, who are free and lovers of freedom, and who will undoubtedly\r\nco-operate with the Union in reestablishing its power. This 'Alleghania'\r\nembraces thirteen counties of North Carolina, three of South Carolina,\r\ntwenty of Georgia, fifteen of Alabama, and twenty-six of Tennessee.\r\n\r\nAccording to Humboldt and other writers on climatology, an elevation of\r\ntwo hundred and sixty-seven feet above the level of the sea is\r\nequivalent in general influence upon vegetation to a degree of latitude\r\nnorthward, at the level of the ocean. Therefore we are not surprised to\r\nlearn from Olmsted that 'Alleghania' does not differ greatly in climate\r\nfrom Long Island, Southern New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. 'The usual\r\ncrops are the same, those of most consequence being corn, rye, oats and\r\ngrass. Fruit is a more precarious crop, from a greater liability to\r\nsevere frosts after the swelling of the buds in the spring. Snow has\r\nfallen several inches in the month of April.'[A]\r\n\r\nThe Western Virginia portion of Alleghania, which in the\r\ncounter-secession programme of its inhabitants was to have formed the\r\nState of 'Kanawha,' embraced in its total population of 284,796 only\r\n10,820 slaves. Its area is 4,211 square miles larger than the entire\r\nState of Maryland. With this we have 'Middle Virginia,' in the valley of\r\nthe Shenandoah, which extends east of the main Alleghany range to the\r\nBlue Ridge. This region also is broadly distinguishable in respect to\r\nslavery from the Atlantic counties. With 200,262 freemen according to\r\nthe census of 1850, it has only 44,742 slaves, and there is reason to\r\nbelieve that this population has largely diminished in favor of freedom.\r\nYet again we have the mountain district of South-western Virginia, where\r\nin its ten counties the proportion of freemen to slaves is nearly ten to\r\none, or 76,892 to 8,693. As regards internal resources, beautiful\r\nscenery, and all that conduces to pleasant life and profitable labor,\r\nthis portion of Virginia far surpasses the eastern division, and will\r\neventually attract the great mass of immigration.\r\n\r\nThe reader is aware that Eastern Kentucky, embracing the counties along\r\nthe western base of the Cumberland Mountains, 'has nobly responded to\r\nthe cause of the Union.' 'They represent a population which from the\r\nfirst outbreak have been on fire with loyal zeal, repudiating all\r\nsympathy with this war of slavery against the Union.' The proportion of\r\nslaves to freemen in these counties, according to the census of 1850, is\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\nCOUNTIES          FREE          SLAVE\r\nLetcher,          2,440          62\r\nFloyd,            5,503         149\r\nHarlan,           4,108         123\r\nWhitley,          7,222         201\r\nKnox,             6,238         612\r\nPerry,            2,972         117\r\nClay,             4,734         515\r\nBreathitt,        3,603         170\r\nMorgan,           7,305         187\r\nJohnson,          3,843          30\r\nLawrence,         6,142         137\r\nCarter,           5,000         257\r\n\r\nIn contrast to this healthy, temperate Eastern Kentucky, 'a portion of\r\nthe great central district of mountain slopes and valleys,' let the\r\nreader turn to the secession hot-bed of the State. He will find it the\r\nlargest slaveholding district of Kentucky. It is worth noting that\r\nsecession is matured in the slave regions, for though it is popularly\r\nidentified with slavery, they are not wanting among its leaders--no, nor\r\namong their traitorous and cowardly sympathizers here at the North--who\r\nconstantly assert that secession is simply a geographical necessity, and\r\nslavery only a secondary cause--that the South will, in fact, eventually\r\nemancipate, and that race and latitude are the great fundamental causes\r\nof national difference, constituting us in fact 'two peoples.' How\r\ncompletely false and puerile are all these assertions, appears from an\r\nexamination of the mountain region now under discussion.\r\n\r\nOf all these sections of 'Alleghania,' none is of more importance to the\r\nFederal Union than East Tennessee. Immensely rich in minerals, with a\r\nhealthy and agreeable climate and much rich soil, it is one of the\r\nfinest countries on earth, lying under the temperate zone, and developes\r\nthe most extraordinary physical perfection in the human form. Its\r\nproportion of slaves to freemen is no greater than in the other mountain\r\nregions of the South--its area is about equivalent to that of\r\nMassachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island united. In considering this\r\nwith the loyalty of its inhabitants, and in studying 'Cumberland Gap,'\r\nthe great natural highway of the Alleghany Range, the observer\r\nappreciates with pleasure the remark of Secretary Chase, who, in a\r\nrecent interview with certain eastern capitalists, disclaimed on behalf\r\nof the Government and of General M'Clellan any purpose to send the army\r\ninto winter quarters, remarking with much significance that 'a glance at\r\nthe map will perhaps astonish those who have never reflected, _how short\r\nis the distance from East Tennessee to Port Royal Harbor, and may\r\nsuggest the possibility of cutting a great rebellion into two small\r\npieces_.'\r\n\r\nIn the mountain region of North Carolina we have 'the Piedmont of the\r\nAlleghanies.' Its seventeen counties embrace a larger area (11,700\r\nsquare miles) than the whole of Vermont. Its scenery is of extraordinary\r\nbeauty, its peaks are the highest east of the Rocky Mountains. There is\r\nfull ground for the belief that in North Carolina a majority of the\r\npeople are Union at heart. The following extract from 'Alleghania' will\r\nbe read with interest as illustrating the assertion:\r\n\r\n    In the Union camps of East Tennessee, there are numerous\r\n    volunteers from Watauga and other adjacent counties over the\r\n    border. At the only popular election suffered to be held upon the\r\n    question of Union and secession, the Union majority was as two to\r\n    one; and even after the storm of Sumter, the vote in the\r\n    convention of North Carolina on a proposition to submit the\r\n    ordinance of secession to a vote of the people, received\r\n    thirty-four yeas to seventy-three nays. I have confidence that\r\n    those thirty-four names, representing one-third of the State, were\r\n    given by delegates from the western counties,--the Alleghany\r\n    counties,--from the base and sides of the Blue Ridge,--from a land\r\n    of corn and cattle, not of cotton. Again, when the news of the\r\n    capture of Hatteras was announced in the legislature of North\r\n    Carolina, it is evident from the language of the Raleigh\r\n    newspapers that an irrepressible explosion of Union feeling--even\r\n    to an outburst of cheers, according to one statement--occurred.\r\n    Nor is such a state of feeling surprising, when we remember that\r\n    not even in Kentucky is the memory of Henry Clay more a fireside\r\n    treasure of the people. In this respect, the quiet, unobtrusive\r\n    'North' State was in striking contrast to its immediate\r\n    neighbors--South Carolina in one direction, and Atlantic Virginia\r\n    in the other. Politically, when the pennons of Clay and Calhoun\r\n    rode the gale, the vote and voice of North Carolina were ever\r\n    given for the great Kentucky leader. Let us accept these omens for\r\n    the winter campaign, which will open with the triumph of the Union\r\n    and the Constitution on the Cumberland heights of East Tennessee.\r\n\r\n'In one-fifth of Georgia, over an area of 12,000 square miles, slavery\r\nonly exists by the usurpation of the cotton aristocracy of the lowland\r\ndistricts of the State.' In all of them, slaves, though in a greater\r\nproportion than in the rest of Alleghania, are very greatly in the\r\nminority, as appears from the following table:--\r\n\r\nCOUNTIES              FREE                 SLAVE\r\nMadison,              3,763                1,933\r\nHart,*\r\nFranklin,             9,076                2,382\r\nJackson,              6,808                2,941\r\nBanks,*\r\nHall,                 7,370                1,336\r\nHabersham,            7,675                1,218\r\nRabun,                2,338                  110\r\nTowns,*\r\nUnion,                6,955                  278\r\nLumpkin,              7,995                  939\r\nDawson,*\r\nForsyth,              7,812                1,027\r\nMilton,*\r\nCherokee,            11,630                1,157\r\nPickens,*\r\nGilmer,               8,236                  200\r\nFaunin*\r\nMurphy,*\r\nWhitefield,*\r\nGordon,               5,156                  828\r\nCass,                10,271                3,008\r\nFloyd,                5,202                2,999\r\nChattoga,             5,131                1,680\r\nWalker,              11,408                1,664\r\nCatoosa,*\r\nDade,                 2,532                  148\r\n\r\n* Counties marked with an asterisk, organized after the census of 1850,\r\nof which the foregoing are returns.\r\n\r\nLast in the list we have North-east Alabama, in which we find the\r\nfollowing counties:--\r\n\r\nCOUNTIES              FREE                 SLAVE\r\nCherokee,            12,170                1,691\r\nDeKalb,               7,730                  506\r\nMarshall,             7,952                  868\r\nJackson,             11,754                2,292\r\nMorgan,               6,636                3,437\r\nMadison,             11,937               14,329\r\nLimestone,            8,399                8,063\r\nLawrence,             8,342                6,858\r\n\r\n'It will be observed,' says Mr. Taylor,\r\n\r\n    That the three counties last named have a slave population, in the\r\n    case of Madison exceeding, and in Limestone and Lawrence nearly\r\n    equal to the number of free inhabitants. They would seem to be an\r\n    exception to our former generalization, and are only included\r\n    because there is other evidence that Athens, in Limestone County,\r\n    and Huntsville, in Morgan County, were to the last possible moment\r\n    the head-quarters of resistance to the Montgomery conspirators. It\r\n    was the Union vote of these highland counties, notwithstanding the\r\n    number of slaves in some of them, which would inevitably have been\r\n    rolled down in condemnation of an ordinance of secession. This was\r\n    well known by Yancey and his associates, and it was to avoid this\r\n    revelation of their weakness over a compact and populous area of\r\n    the State, which was in direct communication with East Tennessee,\r\n    that they refused the ordeal of the ballot upon the consummation\r\n    of their treason to the Union.\r\n\r\n    I estimate that the district which could readily be rallied in\r\n    support of a loyal organization of the government of Alabama, with\r\n    its capital at Huntsville, to be equal to the area of New Jersey,\r\n    or 8,320 square miles. With the occupation of the Alleghanies by\r\n    an army of the Union, and such a base of operations, civil and\r\n    military, in North Alabama, a counter-revolution in that State\r\n    would not be difficult of accomplishment.[B]\r\n\r\nIt will thus be seen, that, in the South itself, there exists a\r\ntremendous groundwork of aid to the North, and of weakness to\r\nsecession. The love of this region for the Union, and its local hatred\r\nfor planterdom with its arrogance towards free labor, is no chimera; nor\r\ndo we make the wish the father to the thought when we assert that a\r\nUnion victory would light up a flame of counter-revolution which would\r\nin time, with Northern aid, crush out the foul rebellion. And relying on\r\nthis fact, we grow confident and exultant. If Europe will only let us\r\nalone--if England will refrain from stretching out a helping hand to\r\nthat slaveocracy for which she has suddenly developed such a strange and\r\nunnatural love, we may yet be, at no distant day, great, powerful, and\r\nfar more united than ever.\r\n\r\nBut we have, in addition to all these districts of Alleghania, a vast\r\nreserve in Texas--that Texas which is now more than half cultivated by\r\nfree labor, and which is amply capable of producing six times as much\r\ncotton as is now raised in the entire South. An armed occupation of\r\nTexas, a copious stream of emigration thither, to be encouraged by very\r\nliberal grants to settlers, and a speedy completion of its railroads,\r\nwould be an offset to secession, well worth of itself all that the war\r\nhas cost. With Texas in our power, with Cumberland Gap firmly held, with\r\nthe negroes in South Carolina fairly disorganized from slavery, with\r\nfree Yankee colonies in the Palmetto State, with New Orleans taken--a\r\nblockade without and complete financial disorder within, what more could\r\nwe desire as a basis to secure thorough reëstablishment of power? Here\r\nour superiority to the South in possessing not only a navy, but, what is\r\nof far more importance, a vast merchant marine containing all the\r\nelements necessary to form a navy of unparalleled power, appears in\r\nclearest light, giving us cause for much congratulation. To effect all\r\nthis, _time_ is required. Let those who fret, look over the map of a\r\nhemisphere--let them reflect on the condition to which Southern perfidy\r\nand theft had reduced us ere the war begun, and then let them moderate\r\ntheir cries. It will all be done; but the programme is a tremendous one,\r\nand the future of the most glorious country on earth requires that it\r\nshall be done thoroughly, and that no risks shall be taken.\r\n\r\nBut, beyond all the aid which is to be expected from a\r\ncounter-revolution in the South, to be drawn from the 'Alleghania'\r\nregion, there is one of vast importance, insisted upon in a series of\r\narticles published during the past year in the New York _Knickerbocker\r\nMagazine_, and which may be appropriately reconsidered in this\r\nconnection. Should the government of the United States, by one or more\r\nvictories, obtain even a temporary sway over the South, it will only\r\nrest with itself to produce a powerful counter-revolution even in those\r\ndistricts which are blackest with slavery. _Let it, when the time shall\r\nseem fit_,--and we urge no undue haste, and no premature meddling with\r\nthe present plans or programme of those in power,--_simply proclaim\r\nEmancipation_, offering to pay all loyal men for their slaves according\r\nto a certain rate. The proportion of Union men who will then start into\r\nlife, even in South Carolina, will be, doubtless, enormous. It may be\r\nobjected that many of these will merely profess Union sentiments for the\r\ntime being. But, on the other hand, those noted rebels who can have no\r\nhope of selling their slaves, save indeed to the Union professors, will\r\nhave small love for the latter, and two parties can not fail to show\r\nthemselves at once. Those who hope to see the slave principle ultimately\r\ntriumphant will oppose selling the chattels; those who wish to 'realize'\r\nat once on them, owing to temporary embarrassments, will urge it; and\r\ndissension of the most formidable character will be at once\r\norganized,--precisely such dissension as the Southern press has long\r\nhoped to see between the dough-faces and patriots of the North, or\r\nbetween its labor and capital, or in any other disastrous dissension.\r\n\r\nBe it borne in mind that the price of slaves is at present greatly\r\ndepressed in the South. Those who would sell would speedily acquire\r\nmore, in the hope of a profit by selling to government. Those too who\r\nwould willingly act as brokers between those who wished to sell, but who\r\nwould not dare to openly do so, would be very numerous. Between these\r\nand the leaders of the ultra pro-slavery party there would be bitter\r\nfeud. Let a counter-revolutionary party once succeed in holding its own\r\nin the South, and the days of secession would speedily be numbered. In a\r\nland where all rushes so rapidly to extremes, we should soon see the war\r\ncarried on for us with a bitterness fully equal to that now manifested\r\ntowards the North.\r\n\r\nIt is with no pleasant feelings that we thus commend counter-revolution.\r\nIt is the worst of war that it drives us to such considerations. But\r\nwhat is to be done when our existence as a nation is at stake, and when\r\nwe are opposed by a remorseless foe which would gladly ruin us\r\nirretrievably? There is no halting half-way. It was these endless\r\nscruples which interfered with the prevention of the war under the\r\nimbecile or traitorous Buchanan; it is lingering scruple and timidity\r\nwhich still inspires in thousands of cowardly hearts a dislike to face\r\nthe grim danger and prevent it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWESTWARD!\r\n\r\n\r\n    How the pink-hued morning clouds\r\n      Go sailing into the west!\r\n  And the pearl-white breath of noon,\r\n  Or the mists round the silver moon,\r\n    In silent, sheeny crowds\r\n      Go sailing into the west!\r\n\r\n    The glowing, fire-eyed sun\r\n      In glory dies in the west;\r\n  And the bird with dreamy crest,\r\n  And soft, sun-loving breast,\r\n    When throbbing day is done,\r\n      Floats slowly into the west.\r\n\r\n    Oh, everything lovely and fair\r\n      Is floating into the west.\r\n  'Tis an unknown land, where our hopes must go,\r\n  And all things beautiful, fluttering slow;\r\n    Our joys all wait for us there,--\r\n      Far out in the dim blue west.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIS COTTON OUR KING?\r\n\r\nBY A COTTON-SPINNER.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo falsehood has been so persistently adhered to by the Southern\r\nplanters and their advocates, and so successfully forced upon the\r\ncredulity of the North, as the statement that white men can not perform\r\nfield labor in the cotton States, coupled with the equally false\r\nassertion that the emancipated negro lapses into barbarism, and ceases\r\nto be an industrious laborer.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the chief points of weakness in a bad cause, that, although\r\na _single_ advocate may succeed in rendering it plausible, _many_ are\r\ncertain to present utterly irreconcilable arguments. An impartial man,\r\nexamining De Bow's _Review_ for a series of years, would arrive at\r\nconclusions in regard to the economy of slave labor, and the necessity\r\nof colored laborers in the Southern States, the very reverse of what the\r\nwriters have intended to enforce.\r\n\r\nIt is constantly asserted that white men can not labor in the tropics,\r\nwhich we may freely admit; but the inference that the climate of the\r\nSouthern States is tropical we have the best authority for denying:\r\nfirstly, from the testimony of all Southern writers when describing\r\ntheir own section of country, and _not_ arguing upon the slavery\r\nquestion; and, secondly, from Humboldt's isothermal lines, by which we\r\nfind that the temperature of the cotton States is the same as that of\r\nPortugal, the south of Spain, Italy, and Australia. Do we find\r\nAustralian emigrants writing home to their friends not to come out\r\nbecause they will not be able to work? We know they do not; and yet the\r\nmean annual temperature of Australia is 70°--greater by five to six\r\ndegrees than that of Texas; and, from the best accounts we can get, the\r\nextreme of heat is very much greater.\r\n\r\nExamine De Bow's analysis of the census of 1850, and we find him\r\ncompelled to admit that one-ninth of the force then cultivating cotton\r\nwere white men. If one-ninth were white men in 1850, when the price of\r\ncotton was much less and the crop much smaller than of late years, how\r\nmany are there now?\r\n\r\nOne of the most reliable witnesses to the cultivation of cotton by free\r\nlabor is a Quaker gentleman in Philadelphia, who conducts a cotton\r\nfactory supplied entirely with free-grown cotton, the goods being sold\r\nto the Quakers, who will not use the product of slave labor of any kind.\r\nThis gentleman writes:--\r\n\r\n    I learned by correspondence with several intelligent Germans in\r\n    Texas, that their experiment of raising cotton by their own labor,\r\n    without the help of slaves, was a complete success. One planter\r\n    offered to supply me at once with one hundred and forty bales\r\n    raised in this way. The ground taken by thee that cotton can be\r\n    raised by white men, as well as by colored men, is entirely\r\n    correct. A very large portion is every year so raised. I have had\r\n    particular information of its being thus raised in Texas,\r\n    Arkansas, Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, and North\r\n    Carolina. In some neighborhoods thousands of bales are thus raised\r\n    within the limits of two or three adjacent counties.\r\n\r\nIt may be urged that this is upon uplands almost exclusively, and that\r\nupon bottom lands it is not possible, on account of their being\r\nunhealthy.\r\n\r\nTwo statements will be made to disprove this latter assertion, and we\r\nwill then admit it to be true, and prove it to be of no consequence.\r\n\r\n    The cotton planters, deserting the rolling land, are fast pouring\r\n    in upon the 'swamp.' Indeed, the impression of the sickliness of\r\n    the South generally has been rapidly losing ground (i.e. among the\r\n    whites of the South), and that blessing, health, is now sought\r\n    with as much confidence on the swamp lands of the Yazoo and the\r\n    Mississippi, as among the hills and plains of Carolina and\r\n    Virginia.--_De Bow's Resources of the South and West_.\r\n\r\nDr. Barton, of New Orleans, in a paper read before the Academy of\r\nScience, says:\r\n\r\n    The class of diseases most fatal at the South are mainly those of\r\n    a preventable nature. In another place I have shown that the\r\n    direct temperature of the sun is not near so great in the South\r\n    during the summer as in the North. In fact, the climate is much\r\n    more endurable, all the year round, with our refreshing breezes,\r\n    and particularly in some of the more elevated parts of it, or\r\n    within one hundred miles of the coast.\r\n\r\nDr. Barton had forgotten that white men can not perform field labor in\r\nthe South.\r\n\r\nBut admit that white men had better work upon uplands,--the crop is\r\nsurer, owing to the less liability to frost and overflow; and good\r\ncultivation will give an equal crop. Intelligent Northern men have taken\r\nup exhausted plantations upon the uplands of North Carolina, and, by the\r\napplication of moderate quantities of guano, phosphate of lime, etc.,\r\nhave carried the crop from two hundred up to eight hundred pounds of\r\nclean cotton per acre; and for the last three years the writer has been\r\nin the habit of selecting the North Carolina guano-grown cotton, in the\r\nNew York market, where it has been shipped via Wilmington or Norfolk, on\r\naccount of its good staple, good color, and extra strength.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing in the cultivation of cotton involving harder work than\r\nthat of corn. In the early stages of its growth it is more tender than\r\ncorn, and requires more care,--which it does not get, since we find\r\nSouthern writers deploring that the cut-worm and the louse are charged\r\nwith many sins which are caused by careless cultivation and the bruises\r\ninflicted by the clumsy negro hoes. The soil is very light, and most of\r\nthe work might be done by the plow and cultivator. Except upon very poor\r\nsoil there is only one plant allowed to eight and even ten square feet.\r\nBy the admission of Texas planters themselves, in the accounts of their\r\ncountry which they have written to induce emigration and sell their\r\nsurplus land, there is very little work to be done during the hottest\r\npart of the summer; the cultivation taking place in the spring, and the\r\npicking in the fall and winter. Dr. J.S. Wilson, of Columbus, Ga.,\r\nwriting upon the diseases of negroes, says there is no article of\r\nclothing so needful to them, and so seldom supplied, as an overcoat.\r\nShould some shrewd Yankee, starting South to go into the business of\r\nraising cotton, lay in a large supply of flannel shirts, thick Guernsey\r\nfrocks, and woolen stockings, for his field hands, how many of his\r\nneighbors would remind him of Lord Timothy Dexter's noted shipment to\r\nthe West Indies, and ask him why he did not take some warming-pans; and\r\nyet, for his supply of thick, warm clothing he would have the authority\r\nof all Southern physicians.\r\n\r\nExamine the directions given for the cultivation of cotton, and see how\r\nmuch labor could be saved, provided slaves could be induced to use good\r\ntools; planting the seed and covering it requiring one horse or mule and\r\n_four_ hands,--one to smooth the ground, one to open the furrow, one to\r\nplant, and one to cover. All of these operations can be performed by one\r\nman with a planting machine. But the negro can not be trusted with one;\r\nfor the moment you begin to teach him the reasons for using it, you\r\nbegin to teach him the benefit of using another complicated machine,\r\nwhich he has not before known much about--his own head and arms, and,\r\nworse than all, his own legs, all of which you have stolen from him; and\r\nthen he will misapply his knowledge, as an old fugitive once told me he\r\nhad done: 'I took my own legs for security, and walked off.'\r\n\r\nI know a fugitive slave who was taught the trade of a blacksmith, and\r\nwho stole the art of writing; and a sad use he made of his\r\naccomplishments; he forged free papers with his pen, and the sacred seal\r\nof the State of Alabama with his tools, and then started North. In\r\nTennessee he got out of money, and stopped to work at his trade, was\r\nsuspected, brought before a court, his papers examined and pronounced\r\ngenuine, and he passed on to Canada or elsewhere. Surely this man did\r\nnot know how to take care of himself!\r\n\r\nThere is no great reason why the slave should exert himself very much,\r\nand why he should not, cannot be better stated than by the Rev. Mr.\r\nMcTeyire, the son of a large planter in South Carolina. 'Men,' he says,\r\n'who own few slaves, and who share the labors of the field or workshop\r\nwith them, are very liable to deceive themselves by a specious process\r\nof reasoning: they say, \"I carry row for row with my negroes, and I put\r\nno more on them than I take on myself.\" But the master who thus reasons\r\nis forgetful or ignorant of the great truth that the negroes' powers of\r\nendurance are less than his, while in the case of the latter there are\r\nwanting those incentives which animate and actually strengthen the\r\nmaster. This labor is for him, the gains of this excess of industry are\r\nto make him rich. What is the servant bettered by the additional bale of\r\ncotton extorted from exhausted nature, only that next year he shall have\r\nmore companions in the field, and the field be enlarged?' This is\r\nextremely well put; but Rev. Mr. McTeyire, of South Carolina, must have\r\nbeen unaware of the fact that it is not possible for a white man to work\r\nrow for row on cotton!\r\n\r\nBut Southern planters are not without some ingenious machines. In a\r\n_premium_ essay upon the cultivation of cotton, read before the Georgia\r\nAgricultural Society, the Hon. Mr. Chambers thus describes one invented\r\nby himself for covering the seed: 'I would cover with a board made of\r\nsome hard wood, an inch or an inch and a half thick, about eight inches\r\nbroad, beveled on the lower edge to make it sharp, slightly notched in\r\nthe middle so as to _straddle_ the row, and screwed on the foot of a\r\ncommon shovel.' Very safe for negroes to use, not being complicated.\r\n\r\nBut in the protests of intelligent Southern men, when they occasionally\r\nwake up to the terrible results of their mode of cultivation, may be\r\nfound their own condemnation.\r\n\r\nDr. Cloud, of Alabama, editor of the '_Cotton Plant_,' mourning the want\r\nof pasturage in his own State, writes thus: 'Our climate is remarkably\r\nfavorable to rich and luxuriant pasturage. The red man of the forest and\r\nthe pioneer white man that came here in advance of our _scratching\r\nplow_, tell us they found the wild oat and native grasses waving thick,\r\nas high as a man's head, and so entwined with the wild pea-vine as to\r\nmake it difficult to ride among it, all over this country. Every cotton\r\nplanter has heard of these fine primitive pasture ranges, and many have\r\nseen them. _If the country or the climate has been cursed in our\r\nappearance as planters here, it has been in the wasting system, that we\r\nintroduced and continue to practice_.'\r\n\r\nGov. Wise, in an address upon the agriculture of Virginia, condenses the\r\nwhole case in an epigram,--' The negroes skin the land, and the white\r\nmen skin the negroes.'\r\n\r\nThe limit to the production of cotton is in the capacity of the\r\nplantation force to pick the amount cultivated by the field hands; but\r\nthe whole available force is insufficient, and large quantities are\r\nlost. The policy of the planters being to buy out the small landholders\r\nin their neighborhood, they have no extra force upon which to draw.\r\nOlmsted says: 'I much doubt if the harvest demand of the principal\r\ncotton districts of Mississippi adds five per cent. to their field-hand\r\nforce. I observed the advantage of the free-labor system exemplified in\r\nWestern Texas, the cotton-fields in the vicinity of the German village\r\nof New Braunfils having been picked far closer than any I had before\r\nseen,--in fact perfectly clean. One woman was pointed out to me who had,\r\nin the first year she had seen a cotton field, picked more cotton in a\r\nday than any slave in the county.'\r\n\r\n'Substitute the French system (that of small allotment or\r\n_parcellement_) for the Mississippi system in cotton-growing, and who\r\ncan doubt that the cotton supply of the United States would be greatly\r\nincreased?'\r\n\r\nDr. Cloud, the most intelligent writer upon cotton cultivation I have\r\nbeen able to find, is urgent in his advice to manure the land, practice\r\nrotation of crops, and produce larger crops upon fewer acres. But the\r\nuniversal practice is precisely the reverse; the process of exhaustion\r\nis followed year after year; cotton is planted year after year; the\r\nseed--which Northern men would cultivate for oil alone, and which\r\nexhausts the land ten times faster than the fibre--is mostly wasted; in\r\nthe words of a Southern paper, 'The seed is left to rot about the\r\ngin-house, producing foul odors, and a constant cause of sickness.' The\r\nland is cropped until it is literally skinned, and then the planter\r\nmigrates to some new region, again to drive out the poor whites,\r\nmonopolize the soil, and leave it once more to grow up to 'piney woods.'\r\n\r\nNote again the warning words of Dr. Cloud: 'With a climate and soil\r\npeculiarly adapted to the production of cotton, our country is equally\r\nfavorable to the production of all the necessary cereals, and as\r\nremarkably favorable to the perfect development of the animal economy,\r\nin fine horses, good milch cows, sheep and hogs; and for fruit of every\r\nvariety, _not tropical_, it is eminently superior. Why is it, then, that\r\nwe find so many _wealthy cotton planters_, whose riches consist entirely\r\nof their slaves and worn-out plantations?'\r\n\r\nNo crop would be more remunerative to a small farmer, with a moderate\r\nfamily to assist in the picking season, than cotton.\r\n\r\nUpon the fertile lands of Texas, which produce one to two bales of\r\ncotton to the acre, ten acres of cotton is the usual allotment to each\r\nhand, with also sufficient land in corn and vegetables to furnish food\r\nfor the laborer and his proportion of the idle force upon the\r\nplantation, which are two to one, without reckoning the planter and\r\noverseer and their families. Now, upon the absurd supposition that a\r\nfree man, with a will in his work, would do no more work than a slave,\r\nwhat would be the result of his labor? 1st, food for his family; 2d, 10\r\nacres of cotton, at 500 pounds to the acre, 5000 pounds, at 10 cents per\r\npound, or $500. But the result would be much greater, for, as a Southern\r\nman has well said, 'the maximum of slave labor would be the minimum of\r\nfree labor;' and the writer can bring proof of many instances where each\r\nfield hand has produced 13, 15, and even 18 bales of cotton in a year.\r\nWith the denser population which would follow the emancipation of the\r\nslaves and the breaking up of the plantation system, a harvest force for\r\nthe picking season would be available, and one man would as easily\r\ncultivate 20 to 25 acres of cotton, with assistance in the picking\r\nseason, as he could thirty acres of corn, the usual allotment to each\r\nhand upon the corn land of Texas.\r\n\r\nThe very expense of slave labor is a proof of the profit which must be\r\nderived from it. The writer has elsewhere estimated the cost of slave\r\nlabor at $20 per month, which statement has been questioned, because no\r\nallowance was made for the increase of the live stock. Now it is well\r\nunderstood that where the women are worked in the fields in such a\r\nmanner as to make their labor pay, the increase of live stock is much\r\nsmaller, and the business of breeding is left to the first families in\r\nVirginia and other localities where the land has been exhausted (readers\r\nwill pardon a plain statement,--it will cause them to realize the full\r\nhorror of the business). The slaves in the cotton States increased from\r\n1850 to 1860 33-88/100 per cent., in all the other slave States 9-61/100\r\nper cent. The surplus increase in the cotton States, above the average,\r\nwas 190,632. Where did they come from?[C] At $900 each, this surplus\r\nrepresents a capital of $171,568,800. How was this sum earned, and to\r\nwhom was it paid?\r\n\r\nLet us examine the estimate of $20 per month, and, although it is\r\nadmitted that female field hands do not bear many children, take the\r\naverage increase of the country, or 2-335/1000 per cent. per annum.\r\n\r\nThe standard of value for an A 1 field hand is $100 for each cent per\r\npound of the price of cotton, say ten cents per pound, $1000, and the\r\nstandard of value for all the slaves upon a plantation is one-half the\r\nvalue of a field hand.\r\n\r\n  Suppose a plantation stocked with\r\n  100 slaves, men, women, and piccaninnies,\r\n  at 8500 each,                           $50,000\r\n  Interest at 8 per cent., a low rate\r\n  for the South,                            4,000\r\n  Customary allowance for life insurance\r\n  or mortality,                             1,000\r\n  Overseer's wages,                         1,000\r\n  House and provisions,                       500\r\n  Doctor's fees, hospital, and medicines,     500\r\n  Renewal and repairs of negro quarters,      500\r\n  Clothing and food, at $1 per week\r\n  for each slave,                           5,200\r\n                                           ______\r\n                                           12,700\r\n\r\n  _Credit_.\r\n\r\n  Increase to keep good the mortality, 2\r\n  Annual gain, 2-335/1000, say         3\r\n            Gain, 5, at $500                2,500\r\n            Net cost,                      10,200\r\n\r\nThe usual allowance for field hands is one-third,--allow it to be forty\r\nin a hundred, the cost of each would be $255 per annum, or $21.25 per\r\nmonth.\r\n\r\nLet each one make his own allowance for the disadvantage of having the\r\nlarger portion of the capital of a State locked up in a tool which would\r\ndo more and better work if recognized as a man and representing no\r\ninvested capital. How much productive industry would there be in New\r\nEngland, if every laborer or mechanic cost his employer $800 to $1500\r\nbefore he could be set to work, and if each one who undertook to labor\r\nupon his own account, and was not so purchased, were stigmatized and\r\ndegraded and termed 'mean white trash?'\r\n\r\nIt will again be objected that the theory of the cotton planter is to\r\nraise all the food and make all the clothing on the plantation. The\r\ncultivation of cotton in the best manner is described by Southern\r\nwriters as a process of _gardening_. Now what would be thought of a\r\nmarket gardener at the North who should keep a large extra force for the\r\npurpose of spinning yarn on a frame of six to ten spindles, and weaving\r\nit up on a rude hand loom? Would this not be protection to home industry\r\nin its most absurd extreme? But this is the plantation system.\r\n\r\nThe correctness of the estimate of cost can be tested in some degree by\r\nthe rates at which able-bodied slaves are hired out. Many lists can be\r\nfound in Southern papers; the latest found by the writer is in De Bow's\r\n_Review_ of 1860.\r\n\r\nA list of fourteen slaves, comprising 'a blacksmith, his wife, eight\r\nfield hands, a lame negro, an old man, an old woman and a young woman,'\r\nwere hired out for the year 1860, in Claiborne Parish, La., at an\r\naverage of $289 each, the highest being $430 for the blacksmith, and\r\n$171 for 'Juda, old woman.'\r\n\r\nThe Southern States have thus far retained almost a monopoly of the\r\ncotton trade of the civilized world by promptly furnishing a fair supply\r\nof cotton of the best quality, and at prices which defied competition\r\nfrom the only region from which it was to be feared, viz., India. This\r\nmonopoly has been retained, notwithstanding the steadily increasing\r\ndemand and higher prices of the last few years.\r\n\r\nImprovements in machinery have enabled manufacturers to pay full wages\r\nto their operatives, both in this country and in England, and to pay\r\nhigher prices for their cotton than they did a few years since, without\r\nmaterially enhancing the cost of their goods, the larger product of\r\ncloth from a less number of hands and the saving of waste offsetting the\r\nhigher price of cotton; but it is not probable that the cost of labor\r\nupon cotton goods can be hereafter materially reduced. The cost of labor\r\nupon the heavy sheetings and drills which form the larger part of our\r\nexports is now only one and one-half cents per yard, and the cost of\r\noil, starch, and all other materials except cotton, less than one-half\r\ncent, making less than two cents for cost of manufacturing; but with\r\ncotton at ten cents to the planter and twelve and one-half cents to the\r\nspinner, the cost of cotton in the yard of same goods is five cents.\r\n\r\nWith cotton at the average price of the last few years, we have supplied\r\na very small portion of India and China with goods, in competition with\r\ntheir hand-made goods of same material. With new markets opening in\r\nJapan and China, and by the building of railroads in India, we have to\r\nmeet a constantly decreasing supply of raw material as compared with the\r\ndemand. Give us cotton at six to seven cents, at which free labor and\r\nskill could well afford it, and the manufacturing industry of New\r\nEngland would receive a development unknown before. But when we ask more\r\ncotton of slavery, we are answered by its great prophet, De Bow; that\r\nbecause we are willing to pay a high price we can not have it; for he\r\nsays, 'Although land is to be had in unlimited quantities, whenever\r\ncotton rises to ten cents, labor becomes too dear to increase production\r\nrapidly.'\r\n\r\nAnd this is what the great system of slave labor has accomplished. The\r\nproduction of its great staple, cotton, is in the hands of less than\r\n100,000 men. In 1850 there were in all the Southern States only 170,000\r\nmen owning more than five slaves each, and they owned 2,800,000 out of\r\n3,300,000.\r\n\r\nThese men have by their system rendered labor degrading,--they have\r\ndriven out their non-slaveholding neighbors by hundreds of thousands to\r\nfind homes and self-respect in the free air of the great West,--they\r\nhave reduced those who remain to a condition of ignorance scarcely to be\r\nfound in any other country claiming to be civilized--so low that even\r\nthe slaves look down upon the 'mean white trash,'--they have sapped the\r\nvery foundations of honor and morality, so that 'Southern chivalry' has\r\nbecome the synonym for treachery, theft, and dishonor in every\r\nform,--they have reached a depth of degradation only to be equalled by\r\nthose Northern men who would now prevent this war from utterly\r\ndestroying slavery,--they have literally skinned over a vast area of\r\ncountry, leaving it for the time a desert, and with an area of\r\n368,312,320 acres in the eight cotton States, they have now under\r\ncultivation in cotton less than 6,000,000 (an area scarcely larger than\r\nthe little State of Massachusetts); they have less than two slave\r\nlaborers to the square mile; and their only opposition to the re-opening\r\nof the African slave-trade is upon the ground that an increase of\r\nlaborers will but reduce the price of cotton, give the planters a great\r\ndeal more trouble and less profit, and only benefit their enemies in New\r\nand Old England.\r\n\r\nHave not the manufacturer, the consumer, the business man, the farmer,\r\nthe soldier, every free man, every friend of the poor whites of the\r\nSouth who are not yet free men, a right and an interest in claiming that\r\nthis monopoly of 100,000 cotton planters shall cease, their estates be\r\nconfiscated for their treason, and divided among our soldiers, to repay\r\nthem for their sacrifices in the cause of their country? First of all,\r\nhowever, let us claim the 100,000,000 acres, not the property of any\r\nindividual, but fought for and paid for by the United States, and then\r\ngiven to that most ungrateful of all the rebel States, Texas--the great\r\n'Cotton State.'\r\n\r\nUpon these fertile lands, and in this most profitable branch of\r\nagriculture, let us find the bounty for our soldiers, the reward for\r\ntheir sacrifices, and our own security for the future good order of the\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nBy so doing we shall silence the outcry of the South that ours is a war\r\nof conquest (since the right of the government to the public lands of\r\nTexas is unquestionable), and, at the same time, furnish a powerful\r\nincentive to the zeal of our soldiers.\r\n\r\nI have compiled a few facts and statements in regard to the soil and\r\nclimate of Texas from Capt. Marcy's Exploration of the Red River, in\r\nwhich he was accompanied by Captain, now General, McLellan, from the\r\n_Texas Almanac_, a most violent pro-slavery publication, and from the\r\nletters of a friend, a loyal Texan, who has been driven from his home,\r\nand is now in the North.\r\n\r\nIn advocating the Memphis and El Paso route for the Pacific Railroad,\r\nCaptain Marcy writes as follows:--\r\n\r\n    The road alluded to, immediately after leaving Fulton, Ark., leads\r\n    to an elevated ridge dividing the waters that flow into Red River\r\n    from those of the Sulphur and Trinity, and continues upon it, with\r\n    but few deviations from the direct course for El Paso and Dona Ana\r\n    to near the Brazos River, a distance of three hundred and twenty\r\n    miles, and mostly through the northern part of Texas. This portion\r\n    of the route has its locality in a country of surpassing beauty\r\n    and fertility, and possesses all the requisites for attracting and\r\n    sustaining a dense farming population. It is diversified with\r\n    prairies and woodland, and is bountifully watered with numerous\r\n    spring brooks, which flow off upon either side of the ridge\r\n    above-mentioned. The crest of the ridge is exceedingly smooth and\r\n    level, and is altogether the best natural or artificial road I\r\n    ever traveled over for the same distance.\r\n\r\n    After leaving this ridge, the road crosses the Brazos near very\r\n    extensive fields of bituminous coal, which burns readily, with a\r\n    clear flame, and is very superior in quality.\r\n\r\n    From the Brazos, the road skirts small affluents of that stream\r\n    and the Colorado for two hundred miles. The soil upon this section\r\n    is principally a red argillaceous loam, similar to that in the Red\r\n    River bottoms, which is so highly productive.\r\n\r\n    As this route is included within the thirty-second and\r\n    thirty-fourth parallels of latitude, it would never be obstructed\r\n    with snow. The whole surface of the country is covered with a\r\n    dense coating of the most nutritious grass, which remains green\r\n    for nine months in the year, and enables cattle to subsist the\r\n    entire winter without any other forage.\r\n\r\n    The line of this road east from Fort Smith would intersect the\r\n    Mississippi in the vicinity of Memphis, Tenn., and would pass\r\n    through the country bordering the Arkansas River, which can not be\r\n    surpassed for fertility.--_Marcy's Red River Exploration_.\r\n\r\nThe route thus described lies through the following counties, and\r\nattention is specially directed to their several products in 1858:--\r\n\r\n                                    Acres\r\n County      White  Slave   Corn   Wheat  Cotton  Sug.

We were in motion at two o'clock in the morning,\r\n    and, taking a north-east course towards the base of the mountain\r\n    chain, passed through mezquite groves, intersected by brooks of\r\n    pure water flowing into the south branch of Cache Creek, upon one\r\n    of which we are encamped.\r\n\r\n    We find the soil good at all places near the mountains, and the\r\n    country well wooded and watered. The grass, consisting of several\r\n    varieties of the grama, is of a superior quality, and grows\r\n    luxuriantly. The climate is salubrious, _and the almost constant\r\n    cool and bracing breezes of the summer months_, with the entire\r\n    absence of anything like marshes or stagnant water, remove all\r\n    sources of noxious malaria, with its attendant evils of autumnal\r\n    fevers.--_Marcy's Exploration of the Red River_, p. 11.\r\n\r\n    Our camp is upon the creek last occupied by the Witchitas before\r\n    they left the mountains. The soil, in point of fertility,\r\n    surpasses anything we have before seen, and the vegetation in the\r\n    old corn-fields is so dense that it was with great difficulty I\r\n    could force my horse through it. It consisted of rank weeds\r\n    growing to the height of twelve feet. Soil of this character must\r\n    have produced an enormous yield of corn. The timber is\r\n    sufficiently abundant for all purposes of the agriculturist, and\r\n    of a superior quality.\r\n\r\n    We have now reached the eastern extremity of the Witchita chain\r\n    of mountains, and shall to-morrow strike our course for Fort\r\n    Asbuekl.\r\n\r\n    The more we have seen of the country about these mountains, the\r\n    more pleased we have been with it. Bounteous nature seems here to\r\n    have strewed her favors with a lavish hand, and to have held out\r\n    every inducement for civilized man to occupy it. The numerous\r\n    tributaries of Cache Creek, flowing from granite fountains, and\r\n    winding like net-work through the valleys, with the advantages of\r\n    good timber, soil and grass, the pure, elastic and delicious\r\n    climate, with a bracing atmosphere, all unite in presenting rare\r\n    inducements to the husbandman.--_Marcy's Red River Exploration_.\r\n\r\nThis section of country is in latitude 34°, longitude 99°; the latitude\r\nthe same as the central part of South Carolina and the southern part of\r\nArkansas.\r\n\r\nWe will now give statements from the _Texas Almanac_.\r\n\r\n    The south winds are the source of comfort and positive luxury to\r\n    the inhabitants of Texas during the hot weather of summer. The\r\n    nearer the sea-coast, the cooler and more brisk the current; but\r\n    the entire area of prairie, and a large portion of the timbered\r\n    country, feel it as a pleasant, healthful breeze, rendering our\r\n    highest temperature tolerable.--_Prof. Forshey, of the Texas\r\n    Military Institute_.\r\n\r\n\r\n    TRINITY RIVER AND ITS VALLEY.\r\n\r\n    So far as I have described the river, the climate is pleasant and\r\n    salubrious, and favorable for planting. The forests and\r\n    cane-brakes mitigate the cold of the northers in winter, and the\r\n    south breezes temper the heat of summer. Contrary to the usual\r\n    opinion, plantations, when once cleared of decaying timber, are\r\n    found to be remarkably healthy. In fact, there are no causes of\r\n    sickness. The river in summer is only a deep, sandy ravine, with a\r\n    clear and rapid stream of water running at its bottom, and in the\r\n    rear of the plantations, instead of swamps, are high rolling\r\n    cane-brakes.\r\n\r\n    The paradox, that there is more good land on the Trinity than on\r\n    the Mississippi, is one which will be readily sustained by those\r\n    who are acquainted with the subject.--_Texas Almanac, 1861_.\r\n\r\n\r\n    TRAVIS COUNTY, TEXAS.\r\n\r\n    The soil is exceedingly rich, from two to ten feet deep, and when\r\n    the seasons are favorable it produces from sixty to one hundred\r\n    bushels of corn, and from one and a half to two bales of cotton,\r\n    per acre. From twenty-five to thirty acres of corn, or twelve to\r\n    fifteen acres of cotton to the hand, are usually cultivated.\r\n\r\n    Our country upon the whole is fertile and well watered, has timber\r\n    enough to supply its demands, and an everlasting amount of stone\r\n    for building; it has an eternal range of mesquit grass, on which\r\n    horses and cattle that never smell corn keep perfectly fat all\r\n    winter. The climate is delightful, the nights pleasant, a fine\r\n    south breeze in summer continually playing over the face of our\r\n    broad prairies, and the atmosphere so pure and invigorating, that\r\n    it is more conducive to good health to sleep out in the open air\r\n    than to sleep in-doors. There is something so attractive in this\r\n    section of country, that those who live here a short time are\r\n    seldom satisfied to live anywhere else.\r\n\r\n    Our citizens are generally intelligent, enterprising, industrious,\r\n    religious, sober, and, _laying politics aside_, honest.--_Texas\r\n    Almanac_.\r\n\r\n\r\n    COMAL COUNTY.\r\n\r\n    BY THE ASSESSOR.\r\n\r\n    Mostly settled by Germans. In this county there are in cultivation\r\n    600 acres in cotton, 15,000 acres in corn, 500 acres in wheat. The\r\n    acre yields 500 pounds of clean cotton, 40 bushels of corn, 20\r\n    bushels of wheat. From 3,500 to 4,000 white inhabitants; 188\r\n    slaves; 396 farms. Improved lands $30, unimproved $3 an acre.\r\n    _Most of the farms are cultivatd by white labor_; a white hand\r\n    cultivates thirty acres of corn. Peaches yield abundantly; apples\r\n    and quinces have been tried successfully. The wild grape, plum,\r\n    cherry, _mulberry_, and blackberry grow luxuriantly. Wine of good\r\n    quality has been made here.\r\n\r\n    New Braunfels is the county seat. It has 2,000 inhabitants, and\r\n    boasts of having the only free school in the State, supported by\r\n    aid from the State school fund, and by direct taxation on the\r\n    property of the school district. Four teachers are employed, and\r\n    there are 250 pupils.\r\n\r\nThe letters of my Texas friend give the following description of the\r\nclimate of Texas:--\r\n\r\n    The climate of Texas is very peculiar. This is owing to the body\r\n    of water to the eastward of it, and to the dry and elevated plain\r\n    of the Llano Estacado, and the lofty mountains which lie to the\r\n    westward. To these two causes are due the moisture and the cool\r\n    temperature, and at times and in certain localities the excessive\r\n    dryness of Texas.\r\n\r\n    The Gulf stream, in its course along the coast of Florida and in\r\n    the Gulf of Mexico, has beneath it, running to the south, a cold\r\n    stream, nearly down to the freezing point. The great equatorial\r\n    current which strikes north of Cape St. Roque and through the\r\n    Caribbean Sea is suddenly narrowed between Cape San Antonio and\r\n    Cape Catoche; here the upper and warmer current, being condensed,\r\n    strikes deeper, and forces to the surface the cold water from the\r\n    under current, sometimes occasioning a roaring and very peculiar\r\n    noise. By this means the Gulf stream is divided, part turning to\r\n    the eastward around Cuba and between that island and Florida, and\r\n    part turning to the westward, north of the banks of Campeachy, and\r\n    striking Padre Island, an island upon the coast of Texas, about\r\n    one hundred and forty miles this current strikes, there are very\r\n    deep soundings, almost up with the land. South of this point, upon\r\n    the beach, are found mahogany and other tropical drift-wood,\r\n    brought there from the tropics; while north of it the drift wood\r\n    is oak, ash, and cotton-wood, brought from the north by a current\r\n    running counter to the Gulf stream, which I will hereafter\r\n    describe. From Padre Island the Gulf stream strikes off to the\r\n    north-east to the mouth of the Mississippi, thence around the\r\n    coast of Florida and through her keys, until it joins the other\r\n    branch. Inside the Gulf stream, along the coast of Texas, is the\r\n    counter-current before referred to, making down the coast at the\r\n    rate of two to three miles per hour, and bringing down the silt\r\n    and mud of the Mississippi, Sabine, etc. I have seen the water off\r\n    the Island of Galveston the color of chocolate, after a long\r\n    norther.\r\n\r\n    Above the centre of Padre Island the coast of Texas deepens at the\r\n    rate of about a fathom to the mile, until at twenty fathoms there\r\n    is a coral reef, and on the easterly side of this reef the water\r\n    deepens, as by the side of a perpendicular wall, to a very great\r\n    depth. This reef marks the boundary of the Gulf stream, and also\r\n    the boundary of the terrible tornado. The tornado of the Gulf of\r\n    Mexico never passes this barrier, never strikes the land, nor has\r\n    it been known within memory of man upon the coast.\r\n\r\n    It seems to confine itself to the course of the warm water of the\r\n    stream, and the great 'Father of the Waters' spreads his\r\n    counter-current down the coast of Texas, like a long flowing\r\n    garment, fending off the storm and the whirlwind, and thus still\r\n    better fitting Texas for the white man and the white man's labor.\r\n\r\n    With this freedom from violent storms comes the delicious\r\n    southerly wind in the summer, which gives health and moisture to\r\n    the larger part of Texas. This wind varies in the point from which\r\n    it flows. From Sabine to Matagorda its course is from south-east\r\n    to south-south-east, growing more and more to the south as the\r\n    coast tends to the south, until at the Rio Grande it blows from\r\n    due south with perhaps a little westing in it. The course of this\r\n    wind will explain the three belts of Texas, the rainy, that of\r\n    less rain, and that of great drought.\r\n\r\n    This wind from the south-east corner from across the ocean and\r\n    gulf (being a continuation of the south-east trades) laden with\r\n    moisture and of a delightful temperature, when it is met by the\r\n    cool air from the mountains, and condensed, giving the rains of\r\n    Eastern and Central Texas. The more southing they have in them,\r\n    the less moisture, until the extreme south-eastern portion of\r\n    Texas, or the country near the mouth of the Rio Grande, is one of\r\n    almost constant drought. There are thus three belts of moisture:\r\n    first, from the Sabine to the mouth of the Brazos, may be called\r\n    the belt of greatest rain,--from the Brazos to Lavaca or Victoria,\r\n    that of moderate rain,--and from Lavaca to the Rio Grande, the dry\r\n    belt. But even in the dry belt there is moisture enough to give\r\n    fine grasses, and make the country a fine one for grazing, and the\r\n    streams taking their rise in great springs, which probably have\r\n    their source in the melting snows of the Rocky Mountains, flowing\r\n    under the Llano Estacado and breaking out in great numbers in a\r\n    line almost north and south, never dry up, even in the dryest\r\n    seasons.\r\n\r\n    In the winter months, Texas has winds from the north, which come\r\n    on very suddenly, and produce great variation in the temperature.\r\n    They are disagreeable, but wholesome, and clear the atmosphere.\r\n    They do not extend north of the Red River, nor very far west, but\r\n    increase in intensity as they go south.\r\n\r\n    No country in the world can be healthier than Texas, and\r\n    consumption and pectoral complaints never originate in the area of\r\n    the northers.\r\n\r\n    Eastern Texas is generally well wooded; Middle and Western Texas\r\n    have wood on the banks of the streams, and frequent spots of\r\n    timber on the prairies.\r\n\r\n    Most of the country is covered with nutritious grass, affording\r\n    good pasture throughout the year, capable of supporting an endless\r\n    number of cattle and sheep, and almost all the soil is suited to\r\n    the growth of cotton. There are more than five thousand square\r\n    miles of bituminous coal in Texas, presenting seams five feet\r\n    thick, and hills of pure gypsum seven hundred feet high. These are\r\n    all covered by a generous sky and climate beneath which the white\r\n    man can live and work without fear of malaria or sickness, and\r\n    where he can enjoy all the blessings of the tropics without their\r\n    attendant disadvantages.\r\n\r\nIt is this superb country which we trust General Lane and his forces may\r\nsoon redeem from the curse of slavery.\r\n\r\nThe woolen manufacturer has an equal interest with the cotton-spinner in\r\ndemanding that this shall be done, for with this unequaled country for\r\nthe production of wool remaining under the curse of slavery, we import\r\nannually nearly thirty million pounds of wool,--about one-third of our\r\nwhole consumption. With Texas free, and emigration from abroad--for a\r\nlong time reduced almost to nothing--freely encouraged, we should become\r\nexporters of wool, not importers.\r\n\r\nBut I am warned that I have exceeded the space allotted me. The absurd\r\nassertion that the emancipated negro lapses into barbarism and will not\r\nwork, can only be met by the question, 'If he will not work except by\r\ncompulsion, why does he work extra after his compulsory labor is over?'\r\nEvidence that he does so work can be presented _ad infinitum_, upon\r\nSouthern testimony; witness that De Bow's _Review_ makes only a _few_\r\nselections.\r\n\r\nThe _peculium_ of Southern servants, even on the plantation, is\r\nsometimes not trifling. We make a _few_ selections, showing--\r\n\r\n    THE NEGROES' CROP.--A friend has reported to us a sale, on\r\n    Tuesday, of a crop of cotton belonging to Elijah Cook, of Harris\r\n    Co., Ga., amounting to $1424 96-100.--_Columbus_ (Ga.) _Sun_, Dec.\r\n    29, 1858.\r\n\r\n    Mr. J.S. Byington informs us that he made two cotton purchases\r\n    lately. One was the cotton crop of the negroes of Dr. Lucas, of\r\n    this vicinity, for which he paid $1,800 in cash, every dollar of\r\n    which goes to the negroes.--_Montgomery (Ala.) Mail_, Jan. 21,\r\n    1859.\r\n\r\n    Speaking of negroes' crops, the sales of which our contemporaries\r\n    are chronicling in various amounts,--the largest which has come to\r\n    our knowledge is one made in Macon, for the negroes of Allen\r\n    McWalker. It amounted to $1969.65.--_Macon (Ga.) Telegraph_, Feb.\r\n    3, 1859.\r\n\r\nUpon Louisiana sugar plantations, the exhausting work of the grinding\r\nseason can only be maintained by a system of premiums and rewards\r\nequivalent to the payment of wages. Under that system the negroes of the\r\nsugar plantations are among the most healthy and contented in the South;\r\nwhile the same labor performed in Cuba, under the most severe\r\ncompulsion, causes an annual decrease of the slave population, and the\r\nproduct of the island is only maintained by fresh importations of slaves\r\nfrom Africa.\r\n\r\nWith the following Southern testimony as to the intelligence of the\r\nnegro, I leave this subject:--\r\n\r\n    Without book learning the Southern slave will partake more and\r\n    more of the life-giving civilization of the master. As it is, his\r\n    intimate relations with the superior race, and the unsystematic\r\n    instruction he receives in the family, have placed him in point of\r\n    intelligence above a large portion of the white laborers of\r\n    Europe.--_Plantation Life, by Rev. Dr. McTeyire_.\r\n\r\nWe claim emancipation for the white man; it can only be secured by the\r\nfreedom of the negro. The infinite justice of the Almighty demands both.\r\n\r\nIf we now fail to accomplish it, to bear in the future the name of\r\n'American Citizen' will be a badge of shame and dishonor.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGENERAL PATTERSON'S CAMPAIGN IN VIRGINIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt seldom happens that the history of any series of events can be\r\nwritten soon after they have transpired. The idea of history implies\r\ncorrectness, impartiality and completeness; and it is of rare occurrence\r\nthat all these requisites can be obtained in their fullness within a\r\nbrief period after the time of which the history is required. The\r\nhistorians of this day write of the past; and the historian of our\r\npresent civil war is not yet born, who shall emulate the completeness\r\nand conciseness of Irving's Columbus, or Prescott's Ferdinand and\r\nIsabella, or Motley's Dutch Republic. Nor can we expect an early\r\nsolution to the 'Fremont question,' which shall be full and\r\nsatisfactory, though the length of time involved be but one hundred\r\ndays. But it is different with Gen. Patterson. It is true that his\r\nloyalty is disputed, and in this question may be involved many\r\ncomplicated issues; but the question of the general result of his three\r\nmonths' campaign in Virginia admits but one answer;--it was a failure.\r\nAnd it is an exception to the general rule that we can, within a few\r\nmonths after his campaign closed, see and understand exactly why and how\r\nhe failed.\r\n\r\nIt is not proposed in this article to discuss the loyalty of Gen.\r\nPatterson, or to take sides with either those who claim for him a\r\npatriot's laurels or those who would have him suffer a traitor's fate.\r\nWe shall ignore this question entirely, simply examining the acts of his\r\nlast campaign, with reference to his capability and efficiency, the\r\nnature and effects of his policy, and the reasons of his failure. We\r\npropose to try him in the same manner and by the same standard as we\r\nwould if his loyalty had never been questioned.\r\n\r\nThe early morning of the 12th day of June, 1861, found the writer a\r\nvolunteer soldier of less than two months' experience in camp, just\r\narrived with his regiment, from the distant Badger State, at\r\nChambersburg, in Pennsylvania, where it was to join Patterson's division\r\nof the Federal army. For the next two months ensuing, the writer\r\npossessed all the facilities attainable to a private in the ranks for\r\nobserving the progress of events in that division of the army, judging\r\nas to the propriety or necessity of the various movements, and forming\r\nopinions as to whether Patterson was using to the best advantage the\r\nmilitary means within his control. These facilities were not many, it is\r\ntrue; but the public opinion of the North demanded certain actions from\r\nthe general, and the writer, though but a private, could judge as to\r\nwhether those demands of the loyal North were reasonable, and as to\r\nwhether Patterson could accomplish what was required, if he chose. He\r\nwas expected to _do something_; it did not matter in what particular\r\nmanner; but it was deemed essential that he should in some way hold\r\nJohnston in check, and prevent his junction with the main rebel force at\r\nManassas. And this was precisely what Patterson did not do. Bull Run was\r\nfought and lost, and the very result attained which Patterson was\r\nexpected to prevent. Could it have been prevented?\r\n\r\nIt is fashionable in these days to set up the cry of inefficiency when a\r\ngeneral does not do everything that public opinion requires. The\r\nAmericans are proverbially a fault-finding people; and it will of course\r\nbe as easy to make out an _ex parte_ case against Gen. Patterson as\r\nagainst our other generals. We propose, nevertheless, at the risk of\r\nbeing unfashionable, to discuss candidly these expectations of the\r\nAmerican people which were not realized, together with the actual doings\r\nof the unsuccessful general. We deem it susceptible of logical proof\r\nthat Patterson might and should have prevented Johnston's junction with\r\nBeauregard.\r\n\r\nTents pitched, and the dust of travel from a journey of a thousand miles\r\nwashed off, the 'boys' of the 1st Wisconsin regiment stretched their\r\nweary limbs on the fragrant clover of Pennsylvania, and, like American\r\nsoldiers everywhere, discussed with earnestness and warmth the causes,\r\nprogress, and prospects of the war. Our own position was not a little\r\ninteresting. The strength of Patterson's division was not precisely\r\nknown, but troops were arriving daily, and it was supposed to consist of\r\nabout twenty thousand men. As was well understood, it was intended to\r\nmenace Harper's Ferry, a strong natural, military and strategic\r\nposition, then held by the rebels. A severe struggle was anticipated if\r\nthe Ferry were attacked, and many were the pictures drawn of bloody\r\nscenes and terrible carnage. But the writer, doubting the assumed\r\nstrength of the rebels at that point, freely expressed the opinion that\r\nthere would be no fight there, but that the rebels would evacuate the\r\npost. And before his regiment left Chambersburg, this prediction was\r\nverified. The rebels, alarmed at the prospect which loomed up before\r\nthem of a strong column of Federal troops, burned the Armory and\r\nArsenal, and fled. And here we may find a key to the whole of the rebel\r\nmanoeuvring--they were weak, and unable to cope with Patterson, _and\r\nthey knew it_. Upon no other hypothesis can we account for their\r\nevacuating so strong and so important a point as Harper's Ferry.\r\n\r\nUp to this time it had been a foregone conclusion with the army, as well\r\nas with the American people, that Patterson was to occupy Harper's\r\nFerry. No other course of action was for a moment thought of. Even so\r\nlate as the 30th of June, when the different brigades were called\r\ntogether, preparatory to crossing the Potomac, very many were sanguine\r\nthat Harper's Ferry was to be made the base of operations, and did not\r\ngive up that opinion till they found themselves _en route_ for\r\nWilliamsport. But the strong strategic position was neglected for more\r\nthan a month; and finally, on the very day when Johnston poured his\r\nfresh legions upon the bloody field of Bull Run, and forced the Federals\r\nto fall back, Patterson, with his back to the foe, entered Harper's\r\nFerry, with his three months' men, whose term of enlistment was\r\nexpiring, by the very road by which Johnston had left it in June.\r\n\r\nThis neglect of Patterson to occupy the strongest point in his field of\r\noperations puts the stamp of imbecility upon him at the commencement of\r\nhis campaign. The rebels expected him to occupy that point, as, even so\r\nlate as the time of his crossing the Potomac, the force which disputed\r\nhis onward march into the valley of Virginia was not so great as that\r\nheld at Charleston to dispute his march from Harper's Ferry in case he\r\nentered the valley there. Patterson himself confessed his mistake, by\r\nretiring to the Ferry in July, for the avowed reason that his three\r\nmonths' men must soon go home, and he must be in such a position as not\r\nto tempt an attack from the rebels while his column was thus weakened\r\nand disorganized, and before he could be reinforced by three years' men.\r\nWhy did not this necessity, and the propriety of holding Harper's Ferry\r\nas a base of operations for this reason alone, if for no other, occur to\r\nthe cautious general before, as it did to so many of less military\r\nexperience than himself? Patterson, at the last day, thus confesses his\r\nerror. It was the first great mistake of his campaign. The second was\r\none of a different nature.\r\n\r\nOn the 2d day of July, the army crossed the Potomac at Williamsport, by\r\nmeans of the ford. The crossing was commenced at daylight, and consumed\r\nthe whole of the day. Just before daylight, a little passage at arms\r\noccurred on the Virginia side of the stream, the companies who had been\r\nthrown over the night before as pickets having been fired on by a\r\ndetachment of the 'Berkeley Border Guard,' and returning the fire\r\npromptly. But this served only to stimulate the already keen energies of\r\nthe Federal forces, who waded knee-deep through the clear Potomac, and\r\ntrudged along over the 'sacred soil' with a willingness unchecked by the\r\ncold nor'wester that raged on that July morning. That portion of\r\nBerkeley County, Virginia, which lies opposite to Willlamsport, is\r\ncalled 'the Neck,' being in the shape of a horse-shoe, and nearly\r\nsurrounded by the detour of the Potomac. The turnpike leading from\r\nWilliamsport to Martinsburg and Winchester traverses the whole length of\r\n'the Neck;' and it was on this road that the advance guard of the\r\ndivision, Abercrombie's Brigade, took its line of march, a brush with\r\nthe rebels being momentarily expected. The first view of their pickets,\r\nafter leaving Williamsport, was obtained at Falling Waters, by which\r\nsonorous appellation the Virginians designate a small and pretty\r\nmill-pond, which loses itself over the dam of a solitary grist-mill,\r\nwithin a stone's throw of the Potomac. Here was a strong natural\r\nposition, and an excellent place for waging a defensive war, if the\r\nrebels had been so disposed. But they did not make a stand till a point\r\nwas reached a mile south from Falling Waters, and about five miles from\r\nWilliamsport, where their skirmishers opened fire at 9.15, A.M. The\r\nskirmish which ensued, and which has since been styled the Battle of\r\nFalling Waters, was sustained on the part of the Federals by\r\nAbercrombie's Brigade, consisting of the 1st Wisconsin and the 11th\r\nPennsylvania regiments, McMullen's Philadelphia company of Independent\r\nRangers, the Philadelphia City Troop of cavalry, and Perkins' Field\r\nBattery of six guns. This force speedily dislodged a superior force of\r\nthe enemy, and pursued them for two miles, as far as the hamlet of\r\nHainesville, where orders from Gen. Patterson to cease the pursuit\r\nallowed the rear-guard of the rebels to elude their grasp. The contest\r\nand the chase lasted but two hours, and at noon the advance guard\r\nencamped at Hainesville. The remainder of the day was consumed by the\r\narmy in selecting grounds and pitching tents; and by night, Gen.\r\nPatterson, with twenty thousand men, had succeeded in marching seven\r\nmiles, routing Col. Jackson's rebel brigade, and occupying Camp Jackson,\r\ndistant about two and one-half miles from the Maryland shore of the\r\nPotomac. On Tuesday, the 3d of July, the indomitable general advanced\r\nfive and one-half miles farther, to Martinsburg, the county seat of\r\nBerkeley County, and occupied the town with his whole force, without\r\nfiring a gun; the rebel rear-guard leaving Martinsburg for the south as\r\nthe Federal advance entered it from the north.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that at such a moment a skillful general would take\r\nadvantage of such a little success, and follow it up, especially when he\r\nhad spent as much time in preparation as had Patterson, by a series of\r\ncrushing blows, if anything could be found to crush. And in view of the\r\nfacts that Gen. Johnston had thus far made almost no opposition to the\r\nadvance of the Unionists, and that Patterson's soldiers were without\r\nexception eager and anxious to push on, the policy of holding back seems\r\nalmost unaccountable. But Patterson tarried at Martinsburg for nearly\r\ntwo weeks, and telegraphed for more troops; and on the 15th of July,\r\nwhen he commenced his forward march toward Winchester, he suddenly\r\ndiscovered that Johnston had so fortified that place that it would be\r\nunsafe to attack it! It may be that he could get no accurate information\r\nas to the strength of the rebel force, and that he supposed them to be\r\nsuperior to himself. Still, there were many signs which a capable\r\ngeneral could have read plainly. It was well known that there were in\r\nJohnston's advance force no really good troops, except the 'Berkeley\r\nBorder Guard,' a company of cavalry, composed of citizens of Berkeley\r\nCounty, who, from their complete and minute knowledge of the country,\r\ntheir skill in the saddle, and their zeal in the rebel cause, were as\r\nformidable, though not so notorious, as the Black Horse Cavalry of\r\nFairfax and Prince William. The rout of the rebels at Hainesville, or\r\nFalling Waters, partook of the nature of a panic, as was evidenced by\r\nthe profuse scattering of knapsacks, clothing, canteens and provisions\r\nalong the 'pike.' Indeed, the conduct of the Virginia militia scarcely\r\nsustained the loud professions of desire to 'fight and die in defending\r\nthe sacred soil of Virginia from the invader,' as announced by the\r\nletters and papers found in their knapsacks. And the whole course of\r\nthese events convinced the private soldiers, if not the commanding\r\ngeneral, that Johnston's highest ambition at that time was to gain time.\r\nDid he not know as well as any one that the time of enlistment of many\r\nof Patterson's men had nearly expired? And what more natural than for\r\nhim to keep the latter at bay till such a time as the withdrawal of very\r\nmany of his best troops would force him to retire? There were many true\r\nUnionists, too, in the ranks of the rebels, who would have been glad of\r\nopportunities to escape; this was well known. It seems impossible to\r\nresist the conclusion that Patterson should have acceded to the\r\nunanimous wish of his rank and file, and followed up his success at\r\nHainesville, by occupying Martinsburg on the 2d, advancing to 'Bunker\r\nHill' on the 3d, and dispersing the small rebel force known to be there,\r\nand celebrating the 4th of July by marching on Winchester, and attacking\r\nand reducing that post, as it seems he might easily have done at that\r\ntime. This would of course prevent the apprehended junction of Johnston\r\nwith Beauregard. The history of the war in the Old Dominion would then\r\nhave been differently written; Bull Run and its panic would not be a\r\nstain upon our national honor, and--but who can not read the rest? It is\r\ntrue, Patterson should bear none of the blame of the Bull Run disaster,\r\nif he could have done nothing to avoid it; but we have shown that he\r\ncould have done what was necessary, and that there were reasons existing\r\nat the time for taking such a course, of which he should have been\r\ncognizant.\r\n\r\nThe army left Martinsburg for the south, as we have seen, on Monday,\r\nJuly 15th. The whole division, with trifling exceptions, moved forward,\r\nand advanced on that day as far as 'Bunker Hill,' ten miles from\r\nMartinsburg. An insignificant rebel force fell back as Patterson\r\nadvanced, and at 'Bunker Hill' the army encamped around the smoking\r\nbrands of the rebel camp-fires, just deserted. Here was a small\r\npost-town called Mill Creek; and near by, the high ridge called 'Bunker\r\nHill' formed another fine natural position for defence; but the rebels\r\nwere not disposed to defend it. Patterson lay here two days, within\r\ntwelve miles of the rebel strong-hold at Winchester, the pickets of the\r\ntwo armies watching each other by night and day. On the 17th the Federal\r\narmy was astir before daylight, and an advance to the south was\r\ncommenced. But before the rear-guard filed down from 'Bunker Hill' to\r\nthe turnpike, a counter-march was ordered; and the whole division\r\nproceeded twelve miles to the east, leaving Winchester on their flank,\r\nand occupying Charlestown, in Jefferson County. What could have pleased\r\nJohnston better? What wonder that he should take the opportunity, as\r\nsoon as satisfied that this flank movement was not intended to operate\r\nagainst him, to leave his fortifications at Winchester in charge of a\r\nsmall force, and rush to reinforce Beauregard? And is it not more than\r\nremarkable that Patterson, after occupying Charlestown for four days,\r\nshould fall back to Harper's Ferry on the very day when his foe had\r\neffected his _ruse de guerre_, and was actually turning the tide of\r\nbattle at Bull Run?\r\n\r\nThere is nothing in all this to change the opinion, previously formed,\r\nthat Patterson should have pushed on to Winchester early in July. The\r\nwhole of Johnston's manoeuvering seems to have been calculated merely to\r\ndeceive Patterson, and to gain time. And so clever was he in his\r\nstrategy, that, when his march to Manassas commenced, Patterson,\r\nlearning either of the main movement or of a feint towards himself,\r\naroused his army at midnight, and held them in readiness to fight, in\r\napprehension of instant attack. As early as the middle of June, when\r\nPatterson threw a brigade over the Potomac at Williamsport, on a\r\nreconnoitering expedition, Johnston heard of the movement, and advanced\r\na small force to engage and delay the Federals, which fell back as soon\r\nas the latter retired, as has since been learned from escaped prisoners\r\nand deserters. Indeed, the whole of Patterson's campaign shows far\r\nsuperior generalship on the part of his adversary.\r\n\r\nScarcely had the cautious general occupied from necessity that point\r\nwhose strength and natural facilities he had previously despised, when\r\nthe term of his appointment as general of the division expired, and the\r\ngovernment allowed him to retire to private life. His successor's first\r\nact was to retire across the Potomac and occupy the Maryland Heights,\r\nopposite to Harper's Ferry, leaving not a foot of rebel soil to be held\r\nby our army as an evidence of the 'something' which had been expected of\r\nthe venerable commander of the army of the Shenandoah. He had spent\r\nthree months of time, and ten millions of money, and had only emulated\r\nthe acts of that Gallic sovereign whose great deeds are immortalized in\r\nthe brief couplet,\r\n\r\n  'The king of France, with twice ten thousand men,\r\n  Marched up the hill, and then--marched down again.'\r\n\r\nHe had done more. He had committed another grave error, which has\r\nreceived but little public attention, but which told with disastrous\r\neffect upon the Union cause in Northern Virginia. That section of the\r\nState, as is well known, contained many true Union men. Previous to\r\nPatterson's entry into Virginia, they had been proscribed and severely\r\ntreated by the secessionists. Many had been impressed by the rebel\r\ntroops; the 'Berkeley Border Guard' had dragged many a peaceable\r\nUnionist from his bed at night to serve in the ranks of Johnston's army.\r\nBut many others had been able to keep their true sentiments wholly to\r\nthemselves, and had feigned sympathy with secession; while many more had\r\nfled from their homes across the Potomac, and sought refuge in loyal\r\nMaryland, where they hung around the Federal camps, vainly urging an\r\nearly advance, that they might go home and take care of their families\r\nand their crops. Thus was Berkeley County completely shackled, and a\r\nreign of terror fully established. And on that bright morning of the 2d\r\nof July, as the Federal army marched over the 'sacred soil,' the cleanly\r\ncut grain fields, with their deserted houses, told plainly of\r\nsecessionist owners, who could stay at home and cut their grain while\r\nthe rebels were in force, but who fled before the advance of Union\r\ntroops, and deserted their homes; while the fields of standing grain,\r\nwith the golden kernels ripe and almost rotting on the stalks, and the\r\ncheerless-looking houses, tenanted only by women and children, told as\r\nplainly of the poor Unionists, driven from home and family by the\r\n'Border Guard' who so bravely 'defended the sacred soil.' With the\r\nadvance of the Union army came back hundreds of Union refugees from\r\nMaryland; poor, half-starved men crept out to the roadside from their\r\nhiding-places, and told the Union troops that they now first saw\r\ndaylight for several weeks; and the lonely yet brave women displayed\r\nfrom their hovels the Union flags, the true 'Red, White, and Blue,'\r\nwhich their loyalty had kept for months concealed. And as the army\r\ntarried at Martinsburg, and reinforcements came in, the secret Unionists\r\navowed their real sentiments; the Union flag was displayed from many a\r\ndwelling; and the fair hands of Martinsburg women stitched beautiful\r\nbanners, which, with words of eloquent loyalty, were presented to the\r\nfavorite Union regiments, and even now are cherished in Northern homes,\r\nor in Union encampments, as mementos of the gratitude of Berkeley County\r\nfor its deliverance from the reign of terror. Yet how was the confidence\r\nrepaid which these loyal people thus reposed in Gen. Patterson? In less\r\nthan three weeks, not a Union soldier was left in Martinsburg, and\r\nbefore the first of August they were withdrawn wholly from Berkeley and\r\nJefferson Counties. And the poor refugees who had returned to their\r\nhomes in good faith, and the loyalists who in equal good faith had\r\nspoken out their true patriotism and their love of the Union, were left\r\nto the tender mercies of the 'Berkeley Border Guard,' and such braves as\r\nthe Texan Rangers, the Mississippi Bowie-knives, and the Louisiana Tiger\r\nZouaves. Gray-headed men like Pendleton and Strother were dragged from\r\ntheir homes to languish for weeks in Richmond jails, and the old reign\r\nof terror was reëstablished with renewed virulence. Shall we ask these\r\npoor, deceived Unionists of Northern Virginia what they think of Gen.\r\nPatterson, and of the success of his campaign? How can we estimate the\r\ninjury to the cause of the Union inflicted in this way alone by a\r\ngrossly inefficient Federal general?\r\n\r\nThere were other reasons than those already enumerated why Patterson\r\nshould have occupied Harper's Ferry at an early day, and these were\r\nreasons of economy, which commended themselves to the judgment of almost\r\nevery one except the commanding general. The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad\r\nis the natural and only good thoroughfare along the valley of the upper\r\nPotomac. Harper's Ferry, confessedly the strongest and best military\r\npoint in Northern Virginia, and the one best fitted for a base of\r\noffensive operations, is on this railroad, and, of course, of easy\r\naccess from Baltimore and Washington. In June last the road was open\r\nfrom Baltimore to the Point of Rocks, between which last place and the\r\nFerry were some rebel obstructions easy to be removed. Had Gen.\r\nPatterson occupied Harper's Ferry in June, and opened the railroad to\r\nthat point, and from thence carried on the campaign like a brave\r\ngeneral, worthy to command the brave men who filled the ranks of his\r\narmy, the government might by this time have made the whole line of the\r\nBaltimore and Ohio Railroad of use, as a means of transporting troops\r\nand munitions between Cincinnati and Baltimore,--a desideratum then, as\r\nnow, very strongly urged, as the shortest route between those points is\r\nthe circuitous one _via_ Harrisburg and Pittsburgh. It could have been\r\nof great use, too, to Patterson's division of the army, in transporting\r\nsupplies from Baltimore, by the most natural and expeditious route. But\r\nit was his plan to enter Virginia at Williamsport, so that all supplies\r\nfor his division must go from Baltimore and Philadelphia to Harrisburg,\r\nand thence by rail to Hagerstown, where they were loaded upon army\r\nwagons, and transported thus to and across the Potomac, and for fifteen\r\nor twenty miles into Virginia, to the Federal camps, at very great\r\noutlay and expense. So earnest did Gen. Patterson seem to be, either in\r\ndoing nothing, or else in causing all the expenditure possible.\r\n\r\nThese are the arguments which address themselves to our reason, as\r\nbearing on the question of Patterson's success or failure, and as\r\nexplanatory of the latter. As before stated, they are urged, not to show\r\nthat Patterson should have possessed prophetic knowledge or any\r\nextraordinary powers, but to illustrate his failure to understand what\r\nwas transpiring before his face and eyes. He is culpable, not because he\r\ndid not achieve impossibilities, but because he did not do what plain\r\ncommon-sense seemed to require. The writer heard, among the Federal\r\ncamps, but one reason suggested for Patterson's neglect to occupy\r\nHarper's Ferry in June, which was, that probably the rebels had\r\nconcealed sundry infernal machines in its vicinity, which would destroy\r\nthousands of the Union soldiers at the proper time. This was building a\r\ngreat military policy on a very small basis. If there was running\r\nthrough Gen. Patterson's policy any such plan of military strategy, or,\r\nin fact, any plan whatever, we have the curious spectacle presented of a\r\ngeneral of an army ignoring common-sense, and building up a plan of a\r\ngreat campaign solely upon improbabilities. And it strikes us that this\r\nmay be the key to the general's system of warfare, and a very plain and\r\nlucid explanation of his failure.\r\n\r\nIt is not deemed desirable here to treat of Patterson's other faults,\r\nsuch as his indulgent treatment of rebel spies, his failure to\r\nconfiscate rebel property, and his distinguishing between the property\r\nof rebels and loyalists, by placing strong guards over the former, and\r\nneglecting to take equal care of the latter. Such acts only prove him to\r\nbe either more nice than wise, or less nice than foolish; unless we\r\nargue him to be, as many do, a secret secessionist. But we leave it to\r\nothers to draw inferences as to his loyalty or disloyalty. Our task is\r\naccomplished if we have shown that whether loyal or false, whether a\r\npatriot or a traitor, his three months' campaign in Virginia proves him\r\nunfit to be a commander, by revealing three great faults, each injuring\r\nthe cause he professed to aid, all combining to render his campaign a\r\nfailure, and two of the three assisting directly in our disaster at Bull\r\nRun, and deepening that dark stain upon our national escutcheon. His\r\nneglect to occupy Harper's Ferry in June, his failure to push on against\r\nJohnston when there was an opportunity to injure him, and his cool\r\nbetrayal of the Unionists of Northern Virginia into the clutches of the\r\nrebel Thugs, will place the name of Patterson by the side of the names\r\nof Lee, Hull, Winder, and Buchanan, who, though not the open enemies of\r\ntheir country, were its false and inefficient friends.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE GAME OF FATE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Ever above this earthly ball,\r\n  There sit two forms, unseen by all,\r\n  Playing, with fearful earnestness,\r\n  Through life and death, a game of chess.\r\n\r\n  Feather of pride and wolfish eye,\r\n  Judas-bearded, glancing sly;\r\n  Many a pawn you have gathered in,\r\n  Through circling ages of shame and sin!\r\n\r\n  Fair as an angel, tender and true,\r\n  Is he who measures his might with you;\r\n  Oft he has lost, in times long gone,\r\n  But ever the terrible game goes on.\r\n\r\n  But where are the chessmen to be found?--\r\n  Where the picket paces his dangerous round;\r\n  Where the general sits, with chart and map;\r\n  Where the scout is scrawling his hurried scrap.\r\n\r\n  Where the Cabinet weigh the chances dread;\r\n  Where the soldier sleeps with the stars o'erhead;\r\n  Where rifles are ringing the peal of death,\r\n  And the dying hero yields his breath.\r\n\r\n  Where the mother and sister in silence sit,\r\n  And far into midnight sew and knit,\r\n  And pray for the soldier-brother or son,--\r\n  God's blessing on all that the four have done!\r\n\r\n  Where the traitors plot, in foul debate,\r\n  To war with God and strive with fate;\r\n  Digging pitfalls to catch them slaves,--\r\n  Pitfalls, to serve for their own deep graves.\r\n\r\n  Where the Bishop-General proves that the rod\r\n  Which lashes women is blest of God.\r\n  There's a rod to come, ere the red leaves fall,\r\n  Which will swallow your rattlesnake, scales and all.\r\n\r\n  Where the wretched Northern renegade\r\n  On a Southern journal plies his trade,\r\n  Swearing and writing, with scowl or smile,\r\n  That all that is Yankee is low and vile.\r\n\r\n  Where the cowardly dough-face talks of war\r\n  But fears we are going a little too far;--\r\n  Hoping the North may win the fight,\r\n  But thinking the South is 'partially right.'\r\n\r\n  Where the trembling, panting contraband\r\n  Makes tracks in haste from the happy land;\r\n  And where the officer-gentlemen\r\n  Catch him and order him home again!\r\n\r\n  Where the sutler acts like an arrant scamp,\r\n  And aids the contractor to rob the camp;\r\n  Both of them serving the South in its sin,\r\n  And all of them helping the devil to win.\r\n\r\n  So the game goes on from day to day,\r\n  But there's ONE behind all who watches the play;\r\n  Well he knows who at last must beat,\r\n  And well he will reckon up every cheat.\r\n\r\n  Wolfish dark player, do your best!\r\n  There's a reckoning for you as well as the rest;\r\n  Eastward or westward your glance may wend,\r\n  But the devil always trips up in the end.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJONATHAN EDWARDS AND THE OLD CLERGY.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf late years the attention of many thinking men has been much turned to\r\nthe early clergy of America. One reads of St. Peter's Church that,\r\nnotwithstanding its immense size above ground, it has an equal amount of\r\nmasonry under ground. Of the iceberg even more can be said, since its\r\nsubmerged proportions are of vastly greater extent than its visible\r\nsurface. One may well inquire how much of American greatness is hidden\r\nin its foundation. How massive indeed must be the hidden corner-stone on\r\nwhich rests the structure of national character. New England is now\r\nturning its attention to the histories of ancient families; genealogy is\r\nno small feature in modern literature, and thus the age seems to confess\r\nthat such research is a token of advance.\r\n\r\nI believe that the strength of our ancestors was owing to their pure and\r\nsimple piety; indeed, one can not go back even for a century without\r\nmeeting this element in clear developement. The old New England\r\npreachers were of a character peculiarly adapted to the severe\r\nexigencies of their day. They stood as iron men in an iron age. However\r\nrude in other social features, the early settlers, as they worked their\r\nway to the frontier, demanded the soothing influences of pastoral care,\r\nand the first institution reared in the forest was the pulpit, the next\r\nthe school-house. The pastors were settled for life, and minister and\r\npeople abode in communion, with little change but that of age. In\r\nseeking a field, the youth just launched into his profession\r\n'candidated' among vacant churches, and was heard with solemn attention\r\nby the selectmen and bench of deacons. Notes were taken by the more\r\nfastidious for subsequent criticism, and the matter was discussed with\r\nall the importance of a national treaty. When the call had been\r\naccepted, the stipend was generally fixed at one hundred pounds, and a\r\nrude parsonage opened its doors of welcome. To this was almost\r\ninvariably attached a farm, whose native sterility called for such\r\nexpenditure of toil that it might truly have been said,\r\n\r\n  'The furrow oft the stubborn glebe has broke.'\r\n\r\nThese men indeed united mental and physical labor in a remarkable\r\ndegree. The long winters were devoted to study, to sermons, or to\r\nmeetings,--the summer to the plow and the harvest. One instance is on\r\nrecord in which the entire stock of a year's sermons were written\r\nbetween December and April. But, notwithstanding the inevitable drudgery\r\nof such a life, the ministry was, upon the whole, noted for study. The\r\ncourse held at Harvard required close application, and even at the\r\nchapel exercises the Scriptures were daily read in the original\r\nlanguages. These labors and studies are recorded in that quaintest of\r\nall American books, Mather's Magnalia. Whatever be the pedantry and\r\nvanity of its author, he is undeniably worthy of rank among the men whom\r\nhe chronicled. Indeed, the Mathers, father and son, illustrated a race\r\nof rare moral and intellectual power. The first of these, who enjoyed\r\nthe profitable name of 'Increase,' was equally popular and successful as\r\npresident of Harvard or pastor of the church of Cambridge, and the son\r\ntakes little pains to conceal his filial pride as he blazons the virtues\r\nof 'Crescentius Madderus.' He is particular in recording him as the\r\nfirst American divine who received the honorary title D.D. As one looks\r\nback upon the primitive days of the nascent university, he is struck by\r\nthe contrast between the present numerous and stately array of halls,\r\nthe magnificent library, and all the pomp of a modern commencement, and\r\nthe slender procession of rudely clad youth led by Increase Mather. As\r\nthey marched out of the old shaky college and filed into the antique\r\nmeeting-house, what would they have said to a glimpse of Gore Hall and\r\nits surroundings? But those were the beginnings of greatness, simple as\r\nthey were.\r\n\r\nThe pages of the Magnalia are filled with portraits hit off in a\r\nmasterly style. Mather was a true 'Porte Crayon,' and knew how to bring\r\nout salient points with a few happy touches. His picture-gallery is like\r\nan ancient Valhalla, full of demigods. Among their characteristics are\r\nstrong contrasts. Here are piety and poverty and learning, hand in hand.\r\nThese men, as we have stated, could swing the axe, or chop logic, at a\r\nmoment's notice; could pull vegetables, or dig out Hebrew roots, with\r\nalternate ease. Notwithstanding their long days of labor, their minds\r\nkept their edge, being freshly set by incessant doctrinal disputations.\r\nSuch, indeed, was the public appetite for controversy that polemic\r\nwarfare never slumbered. Our view of their character is assisted by a\r\ncontrast with the English clergy of the same day, and which reveals\r\nshameful deformities on the part of the latter--avarice, indolence, and\r\ngluttony. Of such, Milton spake in Lycidas, with withering contempt, as\r\nthose who\r\n\r\n    'for their bellies' sake\r\n  Creep, and intrude, and climb into the fold.'\r\n\r\nIf the Puritan poet be charged with prejudice, we have only to turn to\r\nthe pages of Macaulay for confirmation. Where, indeed, if this be true,\r\ndid Fielding obtain the originals for the ordinary at Newgate, or\r\n'parson Trulliber' in Joseph Andrews?\r\n\r\nSad and strange was that disappointment which awaited the first\r\nemigrants to Massachusetts Bay. But there was a divine mercy in it; they\r\ncame to seek peace, but a sword awaited them. I refer to the famous Anne\r\nWheelright controversy, which rent the infant settlement of Boston for\r\nmore than ten years. The excitement extended through the entire colony,\r\naffording many a bitter and vindictive argument. The pulpit belabored it\r\nin sermons of two hours' length, after which the deacons in their\r\nofficial seats occasionally expatiated to audiences whose patience on\r\nthis theme was inexhaustible. As the controversy waxed hot, it got into\r\nthe hands of the civil authorities, and some of its disputants were\r\nthrust into jail as heretical. Anna Wheelright was a woman of great\r\nmental vigor, and could hold her own in a debate with her reverend\r\ndisputants. Unfortunate as this controversy may appear, it proved a\r\nbenefit, by sharpening the public mind to a prodigious degree. Indeed,\r\nthe very children of Boston could define the terms of the covenant of\r\ngrace. Weary of a controversy bordering on persecution, Anne Wheelright\r\nsought a new home in the wilderness, and was subsequently murdered by\r\nthe Indians. But the force of mental exercise which she had put in\r\nmotion still continued. It is worthy of remark that almost the only\r\nintellectual peculiarity to which Franklin refers, in speaking of his\r\nfather, is 'a turn for polemics.' The great features of New England\r\ncharacter were, at that day, opinion and faith. It was these, as boldly\r\nand defiantly expressed, which excited the fears and jealousy of Charles\r\nthe Second, and instigated the deprival of the colonial charters.\r\n\r\nThe studious and prayerful habits of the clergy continued from\r\ngeneration to generation, and their piety was most tender and touching\r\nin their ministrations. We might dwell, had we time, on the Cottons, the\r\nMitchells, and the Sheppards, but, revered above all others, comes\r\nbefore us the venerable form of John Elliott, the missionary, clad in\r\nhomespun apparel, his face shining with inward peace, while his silver\r\nlocks overhang his shoulders. He was the Nestor of divines, and the\r\ncharacter of his labors might be judged from his motto--' Prayers and\r\npains with faith in Christ Jesus can accomplish anything.' His efforts\r\nand successes amongst the Indians were remarkable, and it was commonly\r\nreported that he possessed the gift of prophecy. But he was not the only\r\nman of that day who dwelt so close to the confines of the spiritual\r\nworld as to be alternately visited by angels and devils. Indeed, what\r\ntales of the supernatural Mather relates, what a juxtaposition of saints\r\nand demons! Of course, there was a foundation to build upon,--had not\r\nMather himself in his family for more than a year a possessed girl,\r\nwhose familiar haunted the house and made it ring at times like a\r\nbedlam? It was a peculiar characteristic in this chapter of _diablerie_,\r\nthat when the Scriptures were being read, or prayers attended, the\r\nspasms became terrific; but when any ungodly book was substituted in\r\nplace of the Bible, there was an immediate relief.\r\n\r\nThe age was one of wonders, and Mather devotes an entire book to what he\r\ncalls Thaumaturgia. Many of its statements are bold impositions on the\r\nreader's credulity; but there was much which, in those days of\r\nignorance, must have seemed to Mather to be undeniable phenomena of a\r\nmysterious nature. After the colony had escaped many minor dangers, a\r\nnew ordeal of suffering awaited it in a faith in sorcery, resulting in\r\nthe horrible episode of Salem witchcraft, which may be considered the\r\ndarkest stain upon the age. The death-beds and parting scenes in such a\r\ncommunity were cherished features in domestic history, and almost every\r\ncottage could boast its Euthanasy. Ministering angels not only hovered\r\nover the couch, but touched their harps in melodies, whose music\r\nsometimes reached the human ear. Youth tender and inexperienced claimed\r\na share in these triumphs, and Nathanael Mather, though but seventeen,\r\nexpires in all the maturity of a saintly old age.\r\n\r\nComing down to the survivors of the first emigration, we find them\r\nlingering amid the respect and veneration of the community, and their\r\ngraves were deemed worthy of patriarchal honor. After their departure\r\nthe ministry seems to have lost tone and fervor. The union of church and\r\nstate swept them into secularities, and thus impaired their strength. So\r\ngreat was the decline, that by the close of the first century, formality\r\nchilled the churches, and the people bewailed their coldness, while the\r\naged wept at the remembrance of by-gone days. Cotton Mather had\r\nprophesied of a coming time when churches would have to be gathered _out\r\nof the churches_ in the colony. The cry of the saints was 'Return, how\r\nlong, O Lord, and let it repent thee concerning thy servants.' Some of\r\nthe more hopeful maintained that the midnight only heralded an\r\napproaching dawn. Two ministers on Long Island, Barber and Davenport,\r\nhad received divine assurance of a return of power, and held themselves\r\nin anxious waiting. At last, brilliant flashes began to play athwart the\r\nsky, and instead of the meteoric glare which some feared, it indicated\r\nthe purer sunbeam, in whose genial power the church was to rejoice for\r\nmore than a third of a century. Whitefield's advent sent a thrill\r\nthrough all New England. He sailed from Charleston to Newport, where\r\nvenerable parson Clapp, tottering with age, welcomed him as though he\r\nhad been an angel of God. Whitefield's power was comparable to the\r\nsupernatural, and it was in this view John Foster, at a later day, found\r\nthe only solution of his success. In the pulpit his appearance and\r\nmanners exceeded the dreams of apostolic grace--a youth of elegant form,\r\nwith voice of enchanting melody, clear blue eyes, an endurance which\r\nknew no exhaustion--a fancy which ranged both worlds--were all fused by\r\na burning zeal for the salvation of souls. Such was Whitefield at\r\ntwenty-five, and as such he was worthy of that ovation which he received\r\nat Boston, when governor and council went out in form to welcome him.\r\nThe evangelist bore his honors meekly, and hospitality did not weaken\r\nthe vials of wrath which he poured upon the unfaithful. He found, as he\r\nsaid, in New England 'a darkness which might be felt.' At Cambridge, he\r\nthundered at the deadness of Harvard and its faculty, and electrified\r\nthe land by striking at its glory. The hearers alternately wept and\r\nshivered, and the professors, headed by old Dr. Holyoke (who afterwards\r\nlived to celebrate his hundredth birthday), levelled a defensive and\r\naggressive pamphlet at their castigator; but Governor Belcher kissed the\r\ndauntless preacher, and bade him 'cry aloud and spare not, but show the\r\npeople their sins.'\r\n\r\nThe second century, like the first, opened with fierce ecclesiastical\r\ntumult. Whitefield's itineracy, like the blazing cross in the Lady of\r\nthe Lake, was the signal for an uprising. Fired by his passionate\r\noratory, the masses revolted from the chill formalism of a dead\r\nministry. The effect of the excitement which pervaded New England, when\r\nconsidered merely as an appetizer of the intellect, can not be\r\nover-estimated, and the vigor which the colonial mind thus acquired\r\nastonished in an after day the dullards of the British Parliament. The\r\nchief throb was felt in Connecticut, where strolling preachers of a new\r\norder held forth in barns and school-houses. Among these imitators of\r\nWhitefield were some men of high character, such as Tennant and Finley\r\n(afterwards president of Nassau Hall, Princeton), while others were\r\nfrenzied enthusiasts. Davenport, the chief of these, was 'a\r\nheavenly-minded youth,' whose usefulness was wrecked by fanaticism. In\r\nhis journey he was attended by one whom he called his armor-bearer, and\r\ntheir entrance into each village was signaled by a loud hymn sung by the\r\nexcited pair. The very tone in which Davenport preached has been\r\nperpetuated by his admirers; it was a nasal twang, which had great\r\neffect. A law was passed against those irregularities, and Davenport was\r\nthrown into Hartford jail, where he sang hymns all night, to the great\r\nadmiration of his friends. On being released he went to Lyme, where,\r\nafter sermon, a bonfire of idols was made, to which the women\r\ncontributed their ornaments and fine dresses, and the men their vain\r\nbooks. This religious movement was marred by much evil; yet its fruits,\r\nas we have stated, were found in that mental strength which subsequently\r\nbore the brunt of the Revolution. Its excited scenes are hit off by such\r\nreports as these,--'Sally Sparhawk fell and was carried out of meeting;'\r\nthis statement being frequently repeated. The style of preaching in\r\nvogue may be imagined when we read of Tennant's appearance in the\r\npulpit, with long locks flowing down his back, his gaunt form encased in\r\na coarse garment, girt about the loins with a leathern girdle, in\r\nimitation of the prophet Elijah. His discourses were 'awful and solemn,'\r\nand the houses were crowded, though the cold was so intense as to sheet\r\nLong Island Sound with ice. Other memorials of this great awakening are\r\nfound in Edwards' thrilling sermons, such as 'Sinners in the hands of an\r\nangry God,' 'Wicked men only useful in their destruction,' etc. For\r\nyears after, the grand idea of New England was piety and good morals,\r\nand as there were no journals, except here and there a dwarfed weekly,\r\nthe power of the pulpit was unrivaled. Religion was a common theme in\r\nevery house. As a result, it is stated that during the whole Revolution,\r\nthere was but one case of wilful murder in Massachusetts, and Dwight\r\ninforms us that up to his day there had never been a lawsuit in\r\nNorthampton, nor a loss by fire in which the damage was not mutually\r\nshared by the citizens. He also adds that on a given Sabbath five-sixths\r\nof the community were found in meeting. The minister in each town was\r\nsupported by tax, and being in some sense a public officer, the ceremony\r\nof ordination was sometimes celebrated with procession and band of\r\nmusic.\r\n\r\nJonathan Edwards, the great light of New England, at this time could\r\nhave been found in a quiet village on the Connecticut, whence his fame\r\nhad already spread to the mother country. How Northampton gloried in her\r\nmatchless preacher! For sixty years his grandfather, Solomon Stoddard,\r\nhad labored there. Let us linger a moment over those scenes which,\r\nthough fled like a dream, once witnessed the joys and sorrows of a\r\nlifetime. Here in this retired street stands the weather-stained\r\nparsonage, graced by a pair of saplings, planted by his own hands, to\r\nwhich Northampton points as 'the Edwards elms,' and which now fling\r\ngiant shadows across the lawn. This dwelling, though scant of\r\nfurniture, is passing rich in its domestic treasures. Here is a wife of\r\nlustrous beauty, sweet of disposition, fervent of spirit, and 'mighty in\r\nprayer.' She is a matchless judge of sermons, wise in human nature, and\r\nbeing wiser still in grace, must long rank as a model of the ministerial\r\nwife. Here, too, is her group of daughters, well worthy of such\r\nparentage, Esther, Sarah, Mary, and Jerusha, all beautiful and artless\r\nas herself. Here a world of daily interest is found in the studies and\r\nduties of a New England home. But who is he, of tall and attenuated\r\nform, whose days are passed in his solitary study, secluded like a\r\nhermit from the common experience of life? Like Moses, he is slow of\r\nspeech, and might be considered almost severe of countenance. The\r\nlineaments tell their story of childlike simplicity of character, and\r\nyet they are inspired by an expression of power, which at first seems\r\nrepellant. Those large black eyes seem to pierce and read on every\r\nthought. I have referred to this family in a previous article,[D] but\r\nwould now speak at more length of its paternal head. This man has but\r\ntwo pursuits, study and prayer. Of the outer world he has ever remained\r\nin blissful ignorance, and even of his own parish he only knows what he\r\nhas learned of his wife. He has no 'turn' for visiting, and can not\r\nafford time for vain talk. The secret of this is, that he breathes an\r\natmosphere of his own; his soul is like a star, and dwells apart. Behold\r\nhim seated at his table, jotting down casual thoughts on the backs of\r\nletters and scraps of paper (for paper is very dear); he is building up\r\nsome great argument, whose vast proportions will in due time be\r\ndeveloped, like the uncovering of a colossus. Beware, Mr. Solomon\r\nWilliams of Hatfield, and you, Chubb and Tyndal, and John Taylor of\r\nNorwich, for you will each and all of you find your master in this\r\nsecluded parson. Thirteen hours per day are given to study, and this has\r\nbeen the average for years.\r\n\r\nAnd _such_ study to create realities out of the fogs of metaphysics, and\r\nto span the concrete and the abstract with a bridge such as Milton threw\r\nacross space. This man can spend hours in pursuit of 'volitions' with\r\nall the excitement of the chamois-hunt. Now his eye brightens, for he\r\nhas transfixed an idea, and holds it up in all the nicety of artistic\r\ntouch, while he dissects it to its ramifications. It is all _con amore_\r\nwith him, though his readers will need a clue to the maze of intricate\r\nreasoning.\r\n\r\nOne can not pass through the streets of Northampton, so broad, so rural,\r\nand so picturesque, without being overshadowed by that memory, which may\r\nbe expressed in the sweet lines of Longfellow,--\r\n\r\n  'Here in patience and in sorrow, laboring still with busy hand,\r\n  Like an emigrant he wandered, seeking for the better land.'\r\n\r\nIt is gratifying to know that his memory is honored in Northampton by\r\nthe naming of a church, though all may not understand the connection.\r\nThe old 'meeting-house' (for the Puritans used the word church only in a\r\nspiritual sense) stood fronting the site of the present enormous\r\nedifice. It was torn down in 1812. Here for nearly a quarter of a\r\ncentury the tall form, and face pale and meagre from intense thinking,\r\nappeared each Sabbath before a people among whom his recluse habits\r\nrendered him almost a stranger. Here, having rested upon the desk, upon\r\nthe elbow of his left arm, whose hand held a tiny book of closely\r\nwritten MS., he read with stooping form and low tones those solemn\r\narguments and tremendous appeals which now thrill us from the printed\r\npage. Each of those tiny books was a sermon. Many of these are still\r\npreserved, and Dr. Tryon Edwards, of New London, has a chest filled with\r\nthese memorials of his great ancestor. They are written in so fine a\r\nhand as to be hardly legible except to one practiced in their\r\ndeciphering--a result of the extreme economy of one who, with all\r\ncarefulness, was the largest consumer of paper and ink in New England.\r\nSolemn as was the deportment of this reverend man, sundry practical\r\njokes at his expense are on record. It is said that the house dog was\r\nhis close attendant, and on Sabbath day would invade even the pulpit in\r\nsearch of his master. Hence he was carefully fastened during 'holy\r\ntime.' On one occasion, however, some wag not only loosed the animal,\r\nbut actually garnished his neck with a pair of ministerial bands. The\r\npoor dog, unwitting of his sacred insignia, made his way into the pulpit\r\nwithout being noticed by his absent minded master, until some one showed\r\nhim the dog, _a la parson_, perched up behind him on the pulpit bench.\r\n\r\nAs a public speaker Edwards' delivery was the minimum of force, and in\r\nthis feature he admitted his utter failure. Indeed, when driven from\r\nNorthampton, he replied to Erskine's invitation to remove to Scotland,\r\nthat he was assured that his style would not be acceptable. After his\r\ndismission, the sorrows of poverty fell heavily upon him, and he writes\r\nto the same correspondent that 'he and his large and helpless family\r\nwere to be cast upon the world.' A collection was made for him in\r\nScotland, and forwarded at this time of need. The Scottish saints,\r\nindeed, held strong sympathy with the colonies, and it was their\r\n'benefactions' which supported the mission of Brainerd, the most\r\nsuccessful of modern days. Edwards remained more than a year at\r\nNorthampton after leaving its pulpit, and was humbled by seeing the\r\npeople assemble to hear sermons read by laymen in preference to his own\r\nministrations. What a bitter cup this must have been: but Sarah cheered\r\nhis heart, and grace reigned. In the mean time the girls wrought fancy\r\nwork, which was sent to Boston, and sold in their behalf, and thus they\r\nwere spared from want. Subsequently he was appointed missionary to the\r\nStockbridge Indians. It was Orpheus among the wild beasts, but without\r\nhis success. President Wayland quotes this fact in order to support a\r\ntheory which is palpably false, that a preacher should not be much above\r\nthe literary platform of his people; whereas, Edwards' ill success was\r\nin a large measure owing to the troubles and opposition incident to\r\nfrontier life. With all his sorrows, however, he had one great\r\nsatisfaction. His chief assailant, Joseph Ashley, of Northampton, who\r\nhad borne so large a part in his expulsion, came in deep penitence, and\r\nbesought his forgiveness, which was granted with Christian tenderness.\r\nAshley's compunctions continued, and after Edwards' death increased in\r\nhorror so greatly that to obtain relief he published to the world an\r\nexplicit confession of his sins against 'that eminent servant of God.'\r\n\r\nEdwards, like Milton, had long meditated a work which 'the world would\r\nnot willingly let die,' but, although he had for some years been\r\ngathering materials, yet it was not until his removal to Stockbridge\r\nthat he addressed himself fully to the mighty task of authorship. His\r\nhabits of abstraction grew upon him amazingly during this effort, and\r\nthe notable Sarah sheltered him from intrusion, and anticipated his\r\nwants. She was conscious of the greatness of the work with which he had\r\ngrappled, and stood by his side like a guardian angel while he\r\ndemolished errorists. It was her custom after the labors of the day to\r\nsteal up to the study, where, like Numa and Egeria, they held serene\r\ncommunion. This was his sole medium of secular information, for in his\r\noccasional walks he was like one in a dream. The whole man was engrossed\r\nin what he alone could perform; indeed, to reconcile liberty and\r\nnecessity were a task for which he seemed providentially set apart. But\r\nbeneath these arguments, which rise Alp on Alp, there lurked a quiet\r\nperception of humor, and the _reductio ad absurdum_, which he\r\noccasionally drives home, showed the keenness of Puritan wit. How he\r\nmust have smiled, nay even laughed, in the midst of his abstractions at\r\nthat[E] metaphysical animal which illustrates the absurdity of his\r\nopponents. When 'The Freedom of the Will' was finished, and the author\r\nhad sent it forth to do battle, he felt that the work of his life was\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nJust at this time a deputation waited on him to solicit his acceptance\r\nof the presidency of Nassau Hall. It was a strange sight to that rude\r\nhamlet of Stockbridge--those reverend forms finishing their long journey\r\nat the feet of the poor exiled missionary. When their errand was\r\nannounced, he burst into tears, overcome by a sense of unworthiness, and\r\nin a subsequent letter he confirms his unfitness by reference to his\r\n'flaccid solids and weak and sizy fluids.' But the demand was pressed,\r\nand Northampton learns with astonishment the exaltation of her banished\r\npastor. The successful deputation possessed one member of rare interest.\r\nThis was John Brainerd, who had succeeded his brother David as a\r\nmissionary, and whom Edwards had met ten years before at the bedside of\r\nhis dying brother. David would have been, had both lived, the husband of\r\nJerusha--but now they slept side by side in Northampton burial-ground,\r\nand the surviving brother reappeared bearing this invitation. It was one\r\nnot easily resisted; and so, amid dangers and infirmity, he was fain to\r\nsay,\r\n\r\n  'To-morrow to fresh woods and pastures new.'\r\n\r\nBefore another spring, a higher glory awaited him; and the same year,\r\nfive of his family, including the incomparable Sarah, were likewise\r\n'received up.' A sad year was that to Princeton and to the church.\r\n\r\nWe have stated our opinion, that the activity of the New England mind\r\narose from the digestion of strong doctrine; that very activity now\r\ngenerated a new style of preaching, which may be termed the metaphysical\r\nschool. The days of _thaumaturgia_ were passed, and in place of\r\ndiscussing demonology and temptation, an appetite for subtle dogma\r\nprevailed. I doubt if Britain and Germany, with their combined\r\nuniversities, could have equaled, during the last century, the New\r\nEngland pulpit in mental acuteness or philosophical discrimination. A\r\nreference to Edwards recalls mention among his followers of such names\r\nas Smally, Bellamy, Emmons, and Hopkins. Those who listened to the\r\npreaching of such men could not avoid becoming thinkers, and thought has\r\nmade our country what it is. Very possibly what is known as 'Yankee\r\ningenuity' arose from the thinking habits of careful sermon-hearers. A\r\nman who could follow the subtle theories of the pulpit, could think out\r\nthe most elaborate machinery. Next to Jonathan Edwards, Dr. Emmons\r\npossessed the most philosophical mind of the age. So severe and\r\ninvincible is his logic, that it is said that the New Haven lawyers\r\noften sharpened their minds on Emmons' sermons. His scheme of making God\r\nthe author of sin may be considered one of the errors of a great mind. A\r\nmodern novelist has placed old Dr. Hopkins among the characters of a\r\nromance. But however great may be the powers of Mrs. Stowe, it was quite\r\nimpossible for an æsthetic and poetic mind to grasp that bundle of\r\ndried-up syllogisms which once occupied the Newport pulpit. Hopkins had\r\npreached the church at Great Barrington empty, and that of Newport died\r\nby lingering degrees. Only to think of that tall, ungainly form, the\r\nhead covered with a linen cap, stiff and white, coming forth like an\r\napparition once a week to the public gaze. We do not wonder at the\r\nchild's inquiry '_if it was God that stood up there_.' Hopkins' scheme\r\nof 'indifferent affection' was a grand conception, but as unnatural as\r\ngrand: yet it showed an amazing boldness for a public teacher to lay\r\ndown as a postulate that a willingness to be damned was a condition of\r\nsalvation.\r\n\r\nFrom a survey of the earlier clergy, even as superficial as the present\r\none, we are struck with its ambition of a lofty range of doctrine. They\r\n\r\n                            'reasoned high\r\n  Of providence, foreknowledge, will, and fate,\r\n  Fixed fate, free-will, foreknowledge absolute,\r\n  And found no end in wandering mazes lost.\r\n  Of good and evil much they argued then,\r\n  Of happiness, and final misery,\r\n  Passion, and apathy, glory, and shame.'\r\n\r\nThe highest tribute which Milton could offer the fallen angels was that\r\nmental power which survived the general wreck. And no lesser flight\r\nwould have satisfied the subjects of this sketch. Their lifelong effort\r\nwas still to climb higher, ever exclaiming\r\n\r\n  '--Paula majora canamus.'\r\n\r\nTheir services in the cause of public education are beyond our\r\nappreciation, and it may be well for us to remember that Harvard, Yale,\r\nWilliams, Union, Princeton, Amherst, Hanover, and other institutions,\r\nsprang from the bold philanthrophy of men so poor as often to be objects\r\nof pity. They saw that knowledge is power, and that power they would not\r\nonly possess, but bequeath to coming generations.\r\n\r\nLong as these rambles have been, they would still be incomplete without\r\na tribute to the influence of wives and mothers which soothed and\r\nmellowed the sterner aspect of primitive life; but this can only be\r\nreferred to as a theme worthy of distinct treatment. It should not be\r\nforgotten that the children reared under such influences have often been\r\ncounted worthy of the highest stations of honor and trust; and although\r\nthe scapegrace character of ministers' sons is a common fling, yet\r\ncareful research has proved that it has many and brilliant exceptions.\r\n\r\nWhile penning these pages, my mind has often wandered over ancient\r\nburial-grounds where pastor and people sleep side by side. One may find\r\nthem in every New England town, and they chain with a spell of which the\r\nmodern cemetery with its showy marbles knows nothing! We turn from the\r\nfresh mortality, which chills us with its recent sorrows, to those massy\r\nheadstones whose faint inscriptions tell of generations long since freed\r\nfrom toil. Here one may find the rude monuments of those who still walk\r\nthe earth and lead its progress, and here the heart may run over, as\r\nByron says,\r\n\r\n  'With silent worship of the great of old!\r\n  The dead but sceptered sovereigns who still rule\r\n  Our spirits from their urns.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHEMMING COTTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n  'Hem them in!' is the country's cry;\r\n  See how the bayonet needles fly!\r\n  Nothing neglect and nothing leave,\r\n  Hem them in from the skirt to sleeve.\r\n  Little they reek of scratch or hurt\r\n  Who toil at hemming the Southern shirt;\r\n  Little they'll care, as they shout aloud,\r\n  If the Southern shirt prove a Southern shroud.\r\n  Hurrah for the needles sharp and thin!\r\n  Cotton is saved by hemming it in.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nONE OF MY PREDECESSORS.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo books have quite the same fascination for me as the narratives of old\r\ntravelers. Give me a rainy day, a state of affairs which renders the\r\nperformance of a more serious task impossible, and a volume of Hakluyt\r\nor Purchas, or even of Pinkerton's agreeable collection, and I\r\nexperience a condition of felicity which leaves Gray and his new novel\r\nfar in the background. For I thus not only behold again the familiar\r\nscenery of the earth,--never forgetting a landscape that I have once\r\nseen,--but I am also a living participant in the adventures of those who\r\nhave wandered the same paths, hundreds of years before. I visit\r\nConstantinople while the Porphyrogenite emperors still sit upon the\r\nthrone of the East; I look upon the barbaric court of Muscovy before the\r\nname of Russia is known in the world; I make acquaintance with Genghis\r\nKhan at Karakorum, and with Aurungzebe at Delhi; I invade Japan with\r\nKampfer, penetrate the Arctic Seas with Barentz, or view the gardens of\r\nIspahan in the company of the gallant Sir John Chardin.\r\n\r\nThis taste was not the cause, but is the result, of my own experience.\r\nMy far-off, unknown Arab progenitor says, in one of his poems: 'Fly thy\r\nhome, and journey, if thou strivest for great deeds. Five advantages\r\nthou wilt at least procure by traveling. Thou wilt have pleasure and\r\nprofit; thou wilt enlarge thy prospects, cultivate thyself, and acquire\r\nfriends. It is better to be dead, than, like an insect, to remain always\r\nchained to the same spot of earth.' In the Middle Ages, and especially\r\namong the members of the enlightened Saracenic race, the instinct of\r\ntravel was mainly an instinctive desire for education. There was no\r\nother school of knowledge so complete and practical, in the dearth of\r\nbooks and the absence of other than commercial intercourse between the\r\nends of the earth, I fancy that this instinct, skipping over some\r\ncenturies, reappeared, in my case, in its original form; for it was not\r\nuntil after I had seen a large portion of the earth, that I became\r\nacquainted with the narratives of my predecessors, and recognized my\r\nkinship with them. With the ghost of the mercantile Marco Polo, or those\r\nof the sharp fellows, Bernier and Tavernier, I do not anticipate much\r\nsatisfaction, in the next world; but--if they are not too far off--I\r\nshall shake hands at once with the old monk Rubruquis, and the Knight\r\nArnold von der Harff, and the far traveled son of the Atlas, Ibn Batuta.\r\n\r\nThese old narratives have a charm for me, which I do not find in the\r\nworks of modern tourists. There is an honest homeliness and unreserve\r\nabout them, which I would not exchange for any graces of style. The\r\nwriters need no apologetic or explanatory preface; they sit down with\r\nthe pressure of a solemn duty upon them. When much of the world was but\r\ndimly known, the man who had reached India, China, or the Islands of the\r\nSea, and returned to describe his adventures, made his narrative a\r\nmatter of conscience, and justly considered that he had added something\r\nto the stock of human knowledge. The world of fable had not then\r\ncontracted into as narrow limits as at present; foreign countries were\r\nfull of marvels, and science had not made clear the phenomena of nature.\r\nThe old travelers had all the wonder and the credulity of children. All\r\nwas fish that came to their nets, and their works are singular compounds\r\nof personal adventure, historical episodes, statistics of trade, and\r\nreflections on the laws, manners and religions of races, interwoven with\r\nmany astonishing stories, and with the most amusing conjectures and\r\nspeculations. Their sincerity is apparent on every page. How delightful\r\nis that remark of honest old Bernal Diaz, when, in describing the\r\nbattle of Tlascala, he states that many of the Spanish soldiers believed\r\nthat St. James and St. Thomas fought in person against the pagans, and\r\nadds, in the simplicity of his heart, 'Sinner that I am, it was not\r\ngiven to my eyes to behold either the one or the other of those holy\r\npersons.' Montanus, in his travels through Muscovy, speaks of a\r\nwonderful plant on the borders of Tartary, which resembled a\r\npumpkin-vine in appearance, only that instead of pumpkins it produced\r\nlambs covered with wool. He calls this 'a mighty pleasant story,' but\r\ntakes care to say that he had never seen with his own eyes the lambs\r\ngrowing upon the vines, but only the wool thereof, which the natives\r\nmanufactured into garments.\r\n\r\nAnother characteristic of the old books of travel is, that they are,\r\nunconsciously, autobiographical. The honest pilgrim, in his desire to\r\ngive a faithful description of new lands, is little aware that he is all\r\nthe time describing himself as well. His prejudice, his likings, his\r\ndisappointments and aspirations are all transparently revealed to us,\r\nand through him we lay hold on the living character of his age. We\r\nfollow him, step by step, on his slow and wearisome journey, enjoying\r\nhis fatigues and dangers with the better zest, since we know in advance\r\nthat he reached home safely at last. One of the most popular modern\r\nbooks of travel--Eothen--is a poem which gives us the very atmosphere\r\nand odor of the Orient, but nothing more; and the author floats before\r\nour vision in so dim and wraith-like a manner, that many readers have\r\ndoubted whether the work was founded on actual experience. On the other\r\nhand, those old narratives, of which Robinson Crusoe is the ideal type,\r\nbear unmistakable stains of the soil on every page. You not only feel\r\nthe vital personality of the traveler, but you would distinguish his\r\ndoublet and hose among a thousand. He does not soar, with an airy grace,\r\nfrom one hill-top to another, picking out for you a choice scene here\r\nand there, as he skims the land--he plods along the road, laboriously\r\nand with muddy shoes, and sees the common much oftener than the sublime.\r\n\r\nIn all that concerns man, indeed, a much plainer speech was permitted to\r\nthe old traveler. There were no squeamish readers in those days, and\r\nhence, in some respects, he is too candid for modern taste. But it often\r\nhappens that precisely the characteristics or customs of strange races\r\nwhich are of most value to the anthropologist, belong to those cryptic\r\nmysteries of human nature, to which, in our refined age, one is\r\nprohibited from referring. At least, the absence of constraint--the\r\npossibility of entire frankness, even though the writer should have no\r\noccasion to avail himself of the privilege--imparts a rare loveliness\r\nand raciness to the narrative. On the other hand, in modern works which\r\nI have tested by my own personal knowledge of the subject, I have been\r\nquite as much struck with the amount of suppressed as with that of\r\nexpressed truth. Mansfield Parkyns and Captain Burton, I have no doubt,\r\nwill bear me out in this statement. Why has no African explorer, for\r\ninstance, yet ventured to announce the fact,--at once interesting and\r\nimportant,--that if a traveler in the central regions of that continent\r\ncould be accompanied by his wife, the chances of his success would be\r\ngreatly improved? In the apparent celibacy of explorers, barbarous races\r\nperceive simply an absence or perversion of the masculine instinct,\r\nwhich at once excites their distrust.\r\n\r\nLet me resume the volume which I have laid down to pursue the foregoing\r\nreflections, and, while the eastern storm drives through the autumn\r\nwoods, hurling its mingled volume of rain and leaves against my window,\r\nask the reader to look over my shoulder and follow with me for a while\r\nthe pilgrimage of Abou Abdallah Mohammed, better known under the name of\r\nIbn Batuta,--'may God be satisfied with him, and confound those who have\r\nan aversion towards him!'--to apply to himself his own invocation in\r\nfavor of another.\r\n\r\nIbn Batuta, a native of Tangier, in Morocco, unquestionably takes the\r\nfirst rank among the travelers of the Middle Ages, if we consider the\r\ndistances he traversed, the remote points he reached, or the number of\r\nyears consumed by his wanderings. From Pekin to Timbuctoo, from the\r\nVolga to the Ganges, from Bukhara to Zanzibar, he vibrated to and fro,\r\nmaking himself acquainted, with the exception of Christian Europe, with\r\nthe greater part of the known world. He touched, in many directions, the\r\nborderland of darkness, beyond which the earth fell off precipitously\r\ninto chaotic depths which no mortal might explore. Having reached home\r\nagain after uncounted perils, he sat down to tell the story of his\r\nadventures. Many of his notes had been lost by the way, and he was\r\nobliged to depend mainly on his memory; but as this is a faculty which\r\nall genuine travelers must not only possess, but cultivate by constant\r\nexercise, his narrative is remarkably clear, complete, and truthful.\r\n\r\nBorn on the 24th of February, 1304, he set out, in his twenty-second\r\nyear, on a pilgrimage to Mecca, traversing the Barbary States and Egypt\r\non the way. Once fairly launched in the world, twenty-four years elapsed\r\nbefore he again saw his native town. He explored the various provinces\r\nof Arabia; visited Syria, Persia, and Armenia; resided for a while in\r\nSouthern Russia (Kipchak), then belonging to princes of the line of\r\nGenghis Khan; traveled by land to Constantinople, where he was presented\r\nto the emperor; repeated his pilgrimage to Mecca, and reached Zanzibar.\r\nThen, returning, he made his way to Bukhara, and through Afghanistan to\r\nthe Indus; exercised, for two years, the functions of a _Kadi_, or\r\njudge, at Delhi; was appointed by the Sultan Mohammed, the son of Togluk\r\nKhan, on an embassy to the emperor of China, but, missing the Chinese\r\nvessel, was obliged to remain a year and a half among the Maldive\r\nIslands. Nothing daunted by the delay, he started again, by way of\r\nCeylon and the Indian Archipelago, and finally succeeded in reaching\r\nPekin. He appears to have returned to Tangier in the year 1349, and to\r\nhave taken up his residence soon afterwards in Granada, under the\r\nprotection of the caliph Yusef. His thirst for exploration, however, was\r\nnot yet quenched, and in two years he was ready to undertake a second\r\njourney of greater difficulty and danger. Leaving Fez with a caravan, in\r\nthe year 1351, he crossed the Sahara, and spent three years in Central\r\nAfrica, visiting the great cities Melli and Timbuctoo. He was thus the\r\nfirst to give the world an authentic account of those regions. His\r\ndescriptions correspond, in almost all respects, with those given by the\r\ntravelers of modern times.\r\n\r\nIbn Batuta returned to Morocco in 1354, and there remained until his\r\ndeath, in 1378. During the year after his arrival, he dictated the\r\nhistory of his travels to Ibn Djozay, a young Moorish poet, who, having\r\nbeen unjustly treated by Yusef, in Granada, fled to Fez, where he was\r\nappointed secretary to the Sultan, Abau Inau Faris. The latter, it\r\nappears, commanded that the work should be written, and it was also, no\r\ndoubt, by his order that Ibn Djozay became the amanuensis of our\r\ntraveler. 'He was recommended,' says the introduction, 'to bestow great\r\ncare on the correctness and elegance of the style, to render it clear\r\nand intelligible, in order that the reader may better enjoy the rare\r\nadventures, and draw the greatest profit from the pearl, after it shall\r\nhave been extracted from its shell!' To Ibn Djozay, therefore, we are\r\nindebted for the abundant poetic quotations interspersed throughout the\r\nwork--the ornaments which hang, sometimes with curious effect, on the\r\nplain, straight-forward story which Ibn Batuta tells us. Making the\r\nusual allowance for Oriental exaggeration, and the occasional confusion\r\nwhich must occur in a memory so overcharged, we do not hesitate to\r\npronounce the work worthy of all credit. Burkhardt, Seetzen, and Carl\r\nRitter have expressed their entire confidence in the fidelity of the\r\nnarrative.\r\n\r\nThis interesting work was known to European scholars, until quite\r\nrecently, in a fragmentary condition, frequently disfigured by errors of\r\ntranscription. Since the French occupation of Algiers, however, two or\r\nthree perfect copies have been discovered, one of which, now in the\r\nImperial Library at Paris, bears the autograph of Ibn Djozay. The\r\npublications of the _Société Asiatique_ furnish us with the narrative,\r\ncarefully collated, and differing but slightly, in all probability, from\r\nthe original text. Let us now run over it, freely translating for the\r\nreader as we go. The introduction, which is evidently from the elegant\r\nhand of the amanuensis, is so characteristic that we must extract a few\r\nTitle and all, it opens as follows:\r\n\r\n  A PRESENT MADE TO OBSERVERS,\r\n  TREATING OF THE\r\n  CURIOSITIES OFFERED BY THE CITIES AND\r\n  OTHER WONDERS ENCOUNTERED IN\r\n  TRAVEL.\r\n\r\n'In the name of God, the Clement, the Merciful: Behold what says the\r\nShekh, the judge, the learned man, the truthful, the noble, the devout,\r\nthe very benevolent, the guest of God; who has acquitted himself of the\r\nvisit to the holy places, to the honor of religion; who, in the course\r\nof his travels, has placed his confidence in the Lord of all\r\ncreatures--Abou Abdallah Mohammed, son of Abdallah, son of Ibrahim\r\nAllewatee Alhandjee, known under the name of Ibn Batuta: may God be\r\nmerciful to him, and be content with him, in his great bounty and\r\ngenerosity! Amen.\r\n\r\n'Praise be to God, who has subjected the earth to those who serve him,\r\nin order that they may march by spacious roads--who has placed them on\r\nthe earth, and there located the three vicissitudes of their destiny:\r\nthe creation, the return to the earth, and the resurrection from its\r\nbowels. He has extended it by his power, and it has become a bed for his\r\nservants. He has fixed it by means of inaccessible mountains, of\r\nconsiderable elevation, and has raised over it the summit of heaven,\r\nunsupported by a pillar. He has made the stars to appear as a guide in\r\nthe midst of the darkness of the land and the sea; he has made a lamp of\r\nthe moon, and a torch of the sun. From heaven he has caused waters to\r\ndescend, which vivified the ground when it was dried up. He has made all\r\nvarieties of fruits to grow, and has created diversified regions, giving\r\nthem all sorts of plants. He has caused the two seas to flow--one of\r\nsweet and refreshing waters, the other salt and bitter. He has completed\r\nhis bounties towards his creatures, in subjecting to them the camels,\r\nand in submitting to them the ships, similar to mountains, serving them\r\nas vehicles, instead of the surface of the desert, or the back of the\r\nsea.'\r\n\r\nAfter having, in like manner, pronounced a benediction on Mohammed, the\r\nProphet's friends, and all others in any way connected with him, he\r\ngreets the Sultan of Morocco with a panegyric so dazzling, so\r\nunapproachable in the splendor of its assertions, that we must quote it\r\nas a standard whereby all similar compositions may be measured, sure\r\nthat it will maintain its pre-eminence through all time.\r\n\r\n'It is his reign (that of Abou Inau Faris) which has cured Religion of\r\nher sickness, which has caused the sword of Injustice to return into the\r\nscabbard whence it had been drawn, which has corrected fortune, when it\r\nhad been corrupted, and which has procured custom for the markets of\r\nScience, formerly given up to stagnation. He has rendered manifest the\r\nrules of piety when they would have been obliterated; he has calmed the\r\nregions of the earth when they were agitated; he has caused the\r\ntradition of acts of generosity to revive after his death; he has\r\noccasioned the death of tyrannic customs; he has abated the flame of\r\ndiscord at the moment when it was most enkindled; he has destroyed the\r\ncommands of tyranny, when they exercised an absolute power; he has\r\nelevated the edifices of equity on the pillars of the fear of God, and\r\nhas assured himself, by the strongest evidences, that he possesses\r\nconfidence in the Eternal. His reign possesses a glory, the crown\r\nwhereof is placed on the forehead of Orion, and an illumination which\r\ncovers the Milky Way with the skirts of his robe; a beneficence which\r\nhas given a new youth to the age; a justice which incloses the righteous\r\nwithin its vast tent; a liberality similar to a cloud which waters at\r\nonce the leaves that have fallen from the trees and the trees\r\nthemselves; a courage which, even when the clouds shed torrents of rain,\r\ncauses a torrent of blood to flow; a patience which never tires of\r\nhoping; a prudence which prevents his enemies from approaching his\r\npastures; a resolution which puts their troops to flight before the\r\naction commences; a mildness which delights to pluck pardon from the\r\ntree of crime; a goodness which gains him all hearts; a science, the\r\nlustre whereof enlightens the darkest difficulties; a conduct\r\nconformable to his sincerity, and acts conformable to his designs!'\r\n\r\nLet us here take a long breath, and rest a minute. O, Abou Inau Faris!\r\nwe envy the blessed people that were gathered under thy wing; we weep\r\nfor our degenerate age, wherein thy like is nowhere to be found. No\r\nwonder that Ibn Batuta declares that he lays aside forever his pilgrim's\r\nstaff--that, after traversing the Orient, he sits down under the full\r\nmoon of the Occident, preferring it to all other regions, 'as one\r\nprefers gold-dust to the sands of the highway.' We, too, had we found\r\nsuch a ruler, would have laid aside our staff, and taken the oath of\r\nallegiance.\r\n\r\nThe traveler gives us the day of his departure from home: June 14, 1325.\r\n'I was alone,' says he, 'without a companion with whom I could live\r\nfamiliarly, without a caravan of which I could have made part; but I was\r\nforced onward by a spirit firm in its resolution, and the desire of\r\nvisiting the Holy Places was implanted in my bosom. I therefore\r\ndetermined to separate myself from my friends of both sexes, and I\r\nabandoned my home as the birds abandon their nest. My father and mother\r\nwere still alive. I resigned myself, with grief, to separate from them,\r\nand this was a common cause of sorrow. I was then in my twenty-second\r\nyear.'\r\n\r\nHaving safely reached the town of Tlemeen, he found two ambassadors of\r\nthe king of Tunis, about to set out on their return, and attached\r\nhimself to their suite. On arriving at Bougie, he was attacked with a\r\nviolent fever, and was advised to remain behind. 'No,' said the\r\ndetermined youth, 'if God wills that I should die, let me die on the\r\nroad to Mecca,' and pushed on, through Constantina and Bona, in such a\r\nstate of weakness that he was obliged to unwind his turban and bind\r\nhimself to his saddle, in order to avoid falling from the horse. He thus\r\nreached Tunis, in a state of extreme exhaustion and despondency. 'No one\r\nsaluted me,' says he, 'for I was not acquainted with a single person\r\nthere. I was seized with such an emotion of sadness that I could not\r\nsuppress my sobs, and my tears flowed in abundance. One of the pilgrims,\r\nremarking my condition, advanced towards me, saluting and comforting me.\r\nHe did not cease to cheer me up with his conversation, until I had\r\nentered the city.'\r\n\r\nIn a short time, he seems to have recovered both his health and spirits;\r\nfor, on reaching the town of Sefakos, he married the daughter of one of\r\nthe syndics of the corporation of Tunis. This proceeding strikes us as a\r\nsingular preparation for a long and dangerous journey, but it is a\r\npreliminary which would immediately suggest itself to a Mussulman of\r\ngood character. In fact, it was equivalent in those days--and still\r\nwould be, in some parts of the Orient--to a proclamation of his\r\nrespectability. Ibn Batuta, however, was not fortunate in this\r\nmatrimonial adventure. Two months afterwards, he naïvely informs us:\r\n'There arose such a disagreement between myself and my father-in-law,\r\nthat I was obliged to separate from my wife. I thereupon married the\r\ndaughter of an official of Fez. The marriage was consummated at the\r\ncastle of Zanah, and I celebrated it by a feast, for which I detained\r\nthe caravan for a whole day.'\r\n\r\nAfter this announcement, he is silent concerning his domestic relations.\r\nPerhaps the number of his connubial changes was too great to be\r\nrecorded; perhaps no son was born to establish his honor among men;\r\nperhaps, with increasing sanctity, he forswore the sex. The last\r\nconjecture is probably correct, as it tallies with the reputation for\r\nwisdom and purity which he gradually acquired.\r\n\r\nFinally, in April, 1326, our traveler reached Alexandria, the first\r\nstrange city which impressed him by its size and splendor. 'Alexandria,'\r\nsays he, 'is a jewel whereof the brilliancy is manifest--a virgin which\r\nsparkles with her ornaments. She illumines the Occident with her\r\nsplendor: she unites the most diverse beauties, on account of her\r\nsituation midway between the Rising and the Setting.' At that time the\r\ncelebrated Pharos was still standing, and the following description of\r\nit, though not very clear, will interest the reader: 'It is a square\r\nedifice, which towers into the air. Its gate is raised above the surface\r\nof the earth, and opposite to it there is an edifice of similar height,\r\nwhich serves to support planks, across which one must wait to arrive at\r\nthe gate of the Pharos. When these planks are taken away, there is no\r\nmeans of crossing. Inside of the entrance is a space where the guardian\r\nof the edifice is stationed. The interior of the Pharos contains many\r\napartments. Each of its four sides is a hundred and forty spans in\r\nlength. The building is situated on a high hill, one parasang from the\r\ncity, and on a tongue of land which the sea surrounds on three sides.\r\nOne can therefore only reach the Pharos from the land side, by leaving\r\nthe city. I directed my course towards the Pharos a second time, on my\r\nreturn to the West, in the year 1349, and I found that its ruin was\r\ncomplete, so that one could neither enter, nor even reach the gate.'\r\n\r\nCommencing with Alexandria, Ibn Batuta is careful, in every city which\r\nhe visits, to give an account of the distinguished _shekhs_ or _imams_,\r\nwith characteristic anecdotes of their saintly or miraculous lives. The\r\nvalue and interest of these sketches reconcile us to the brevity of his\r\ndescriptions. He tells us, for example, that the _kadi_ (judge) of\r\nAlexandria, who was likewise a master of the art of eloquence, 'covered\r\nhis head with a turban which surpassed in volume all the turbans then to\r\nbe seen. I have never beheld, neither in the East nor the West, one so\r\nvoluminous. He was one day seated in a mosque, before the pulpit, and\r\nhis turban filled almost the entire space.' At the town of Fooah, in the\r\nDelta, on his way to Cairo, occurred his first marvelous adventure.\r\n'During the night,' says he, 'while I slept on the roof of the dwelling\r\nof the shekh Abou Abdallah, I saw myself, in a dream, carried on the\r\nwing of a great bird, which flew in the direction of Mecca, then in that\r\nof Yemen; then it transported me to the East, after which it passed\r\ntowards the South; then it flew again far to the East, alighted upon a\r\ndark and misty country, and there abandoned me. I was amazed at this\r\nvision, and said to myself, \"If the shekh can interpret my dream, he is\r\ntruly as holy as he is said to be.\" When I presented myself, in the\r\nmorning, to take part in the early prayer, he charged me to take the\r\nlead, in the quality of _imam_. Afterwards he called me to him, and\r\nexplained my dream; in fact, when I had related it to him, he said:\r\n\"Thou wilt make the pilgrimage to Mecca, thou wilt visit the tomb of the\r\nProphet, thou wilt traverse Yemen, Irak, the country of the Turks, and\r\nIndia; thou wilt remain a long time in the latter country, where thou\r\nwilt see my brother Dilehad, who will extricate thee from an affliction\r\ninto which thou shalt fall.\" Having spoken, he provided me with money,\r\nand small biscuits for the journey. I said my farewells and departed.\r\nSince I left him, I have experienced nothing but good treatment in the\r\ncourse of my travels, and his benedictions always came to my aid.'\r\n\r\nPassing over the traveler's visit to Damietta and the other towns of the\r\nDelta, let us hear his enthusiastic description of Cairo, at the time of\r\nits greatest prosperity: 'Finally, I reached the city of Cairo, the\r\nmetropolis of the country and the ancient residence of Pharaoh the\r\nImpaler; mistress of rich and extended regions, attaining the utmost\r\nlimits of possibility in the multitude of its population, and exalting\r\nitself on account of its beauty and splendor. It is the rendezvous of\r\ntravelers, the station of the weak and the powerful. Thou wilt there\r\nfind all that thou desirest--the wise and the ignorant, the industrious\r\nand the trifling, the mild or the angry, men of low extraction or of\r\nlofty birth, the illustrious and the obscure. The number of its\r\ninhabitants is so considerable that their currents resemble those of an\r\nagitated sea, and the city lacks very little of being too small to\r\ncontain them, notwithstanding its extent and capacity. Although founded\r\nlong since, it enjoys a youth forever renewed; the star of its horoscope\r\ndoes not cease to inhabit a fortunate house. It is in speaking of Cairo\r\nthat Wasr ed-deen has written:\r\n\r\n  \"It is a paradise in truth; its gardens ever smile,\r\n  Adorned and fed so plenteously by all the waves of Kile,\r\n  Which, fretted by the blowing wind, from shore across to shore,\r\n  Mimic the armor's azure scales the prophet David wore;\r\n  Within its fluid element the naked fear to glide,\r\n  And ships, like winged heavenly spheres, go up and down the tide.'\"\r\n\r\nIbn Batuta's description of the pyramids is very curious, and we can\r\naccount for it on no other supposition than that he merely saw them in\r\nthe distance (probably from the citadel of Cairo), relying on hearsay\r\nfor further particulars. After stating that they were built by the\r\nancient _Hermes_, whom he supposes to be identical with Enoch, as a\r\nrepository for the antediluvian arts and sciences, he says: 'The\r\npyramids are built of hard, well-cut stone. They are of a very\r\nconsiderable elevation, and of a circular form, capacious at the base\r\nand narrow at the summit, _in the fashion of cones_. They have no doors,\r\nand one is ignorant of the manner in which they have been constructed.'\r\n\r\nIn his journey up the Nile, Ibn Batuta never fails to give an account of\r\nevery Moslem saint or theologian whom he meets, but only in one or two\r\ninstances does he mention the antiquities, which, in that age, must have\r\nbeen still more conspicuous than now. He even passes over the plain of\r\nThebes without the slightest notice of the great temple of Karnak.\r\nDisappointed in his plan of crossing the Red Sea to Jidda, he returned\r\nto Cairo, and at once set out for Syria. Here, the first place of\r\ninterest which he visited was Hebron, where he performed his devotions\r\nat the tombs of the patriarchs. We learn that there were archæcological\r\nwritings in those days, for he quotes from a work entitled 'The Torch of\r\nHearts, on the Subject of the Authenticity of the Tombs of Abraham,\r\nIsaac, and Jacob.' Unfortunately, the evidence adduced would not be very\r\nsatisfactory to us, for it rests entirely on the following statement\r\nmade by Mohammed to a certain Abou Horairah: 'When the angel Gabriel\r\ntook me on the noctural journey to Jerusalem, we passed above the tomb\r\nof Abraham, and he said to me, \"Descend, and make a prayer of two\r\ngenuflexions, for here is the sepulchre of thy father Abraham!\" Then we\r\ntraversed Bethlehem, and he said also, \"Descend, make a prayer of two\r\ngenuflexions, for here was born thy brother Jesus!\"'\r\n\r\nOf Jerusalem, which he calls 'the noble, the holy--may God glorify it!'\r\nhe says: 'Among the sanctuaries on the borders of the valley known under\r\nthe name of Gehenna, east of the city and on an elevated hill (the Mount\r\nof Olives), one sees an edifice which is said to stand on the spot\r\nwhence Jesus ascended to heaven. In the middle of the same valley there\r\nis a church where the Christians worship: they affirm that it contains\r\nthe sepulchre of Mary. There is also another church, equally venerated,\r\nto which the Christians make a pilgrimage. The reason whereof, however,\r\nis a lie, for they pretend that it contains the tomb of Jesus. Each\r\nperson who goes thither as a pilgrim is obliged to pay a certain tribute\r\nto the Mussulmans, and to undergo divers sorts of humiliations, which\r\nthe Christians perform very much against their will. They there see the\r\nplace where the cradle of Jesus stood, and come to implore his\r\nintercession.'\r\n\r\nI have not space to follow our traveler through all the cities of the\r\nSyrian coast, northward to Aleppo, but I can not omit offering one\r\nflower from the garland of poetical quotations which Ibu Batuta (or\r\nrather his amanuensis, Ibn Djozay) hangs on the citadel of the latter\r\ncapital. I presume the city then occupied the same position as at\r\npresent, on a plain surrounding the rocky acropolis, which is so\r\nstriking and picturesque a feature as to justify the enthusiasm of the\r\nOriental bards. Djemal ed-deen All, however, surpasses them all in the\r\nsplendor of his images. Hear him:--\r\n\r\n  'So lofty soars this castle, so high its summit stands,\r\n  Immense and far uplifted above the lower lands,\r\n  It lacks but little, truly, that with the heavenly sphere\r\n  Around the earth revolving, its towers would interfere.\r\n  And they who dwell within it must seek the Milky Way;\r\n  There is no nearer cistern which win their thirst allay:\r\n  Their horses there go browsing, and crop the stars that pass,\r\n  As other beasts the blossoms that open in the grass!'\r\n\r\nAfter this flight, I think I can afford to omit the string of quotations\r\nconcerning Damascus, which is celebrated with an equal extravagance. Ibn\r\nBatuta gives a very careful account of the great mosque, including its\r\npriests and scholars. During his stay the plague raged with such\r\nviolence that the deaths at one time amounted to two thousand a day. He\r\nrelates one circumstance which shows that even religious intolerance\r\nvanished in times of distress. 'All the inhabitants of the city, men,\r\nwomen, large and small, took part in a procession to the Mosque of\r\nEl-Akdam, two miles south of Damascus. The Jews came forth with their\r\nPentateuch, and the Christians with their Gospel, followed by their\r\nwomen and children. All wept, supplicated, and sought help from God,\r\nthrough the means of his Word and his prophets. They repaired to the\r\nmosque, where they remained, praying and invoking God, until three\r\no'clock in the afternoon. Then they returned to the city, made the\r\nprayer of Friday, and the Lord consoled them.'\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of September, 1326, he left Damascus, with the great caravan\r\nof pilgrims, for Mecca. He enumerates all the stations on the route, and\r\nhis itinerary is almost identical with that which the caravan follows at\r\nthe present day. Much space is devoted to a description of the religious\r\nobservances which he followed; and, singularly enough, if any\r\nconfirmation of his fidelity as a narrator were needed, it is furnished\r\nby the work of Captain Burton. The account of the sacred cities of\r\nMedineh and Mecca corresponds in every important particular with that of\r\nthe modern traveler. Thus the integrity of Ibn Batuta, like that of\r\nMarco Polo, is established, after the lapse of five hundred years.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the chair of Mohammed, which is preserved in the mosque\r\nat Medineh, he relates the following beautiful tradition: 'It is said\r\nthat the ambassador of God at first preached near the trunk of a\r\npalm-tree in the mosque, and that after he had constructed the chair and\r\ntransported it thither, the trunk of the palm-tree groaned, as the\r\nfemale camel groans after her young. Mohammed thereupon went down to the\r\ntree and embraced it; after which it remained silent. The Prophet said,\r\n\"If I had not embraced it, it would have continued to groan until the\r\nday of the resurrection.\"'\r\n\r\nAfter faithfully performing all the observances prescribed for the\r\npilgrim to Mecca, Ibn Batuta left that city and returned to Medineh. He\r\nthen crossed the Arabian peninsula in a north-eastern direction, to the\r\ncity of Meshed Ali, near the Euphrates, and thence descended that river\r\nto Bassora. Here he gives us two amusing anecdotes, which reflectively\r\nillustrate his shrewdness and the sturdiness with which he maintained\r\nhis religious views. 'The inhabitants of Bassora,' says he, 'are gifted\r\nwith a generous character. They are familiar with strangers, rendering\r\nthem that which is their due, in such a manner that no one finds a\r\nsojourn among them tiresome. They make their Sunday prayers in the\r\nmosque of the Prince of Believers, Ali. I once attended the prayers in\r\nthis mosque; and when the preacher arose and began to recite the sermon,\r\nhe made numerous and evident faults. I was surprised thereat, and spoke\r\nof it to the judge Hodjat-ed-deen, who answered, \"In this city, there is\r\nno longer an individual who has any knowledge of grammar.\" This is an\r\ninstruction for whoever reflects thereon, and let us praise God, who\r\nchanges things and reverses the face of affairs! In fact, this city of\r\nBassora, the inhabitants whereof had obtained preëminence in grammar,\r\nwhich there had its origin and received its development,--this city,\r\nwhich gave to the world the master of this noble science, whose priority\r\nno one contests,--does not now possess a single preacher who pronounces\r\nthe Sunday sermon according to grammatical rules!\r\n\r\n'The mosque has seven minarets, one of which, according to the belief of\r\nthe inhabitants, shakes whenever the name of Ali, son of Abou Talib, is\r\ninvoked. I ascended to the terrace (roof) of this mosque, accompanied by\r\none of the men of Bassora. There I saw, at one of the corners, a piece\r\nof wood nailed to the minaret, and resembling the handle of a mason's\r\ntrowel. He who was with me took hold of it, saying, \"By the head of the\r\nprince of believers, Ali, shake thyself!\" Therewith he shook the handle,\r\nand the minaret trembled. In turn, I placed my hand upon it, and I said\r\nto the man, \"And _I_ say, by the head of Abou Bekr, successor to the\r\nAmbassador of God, shake thyself!\" Therewith I shook the handle, and the\r\nminaret trembled as before. The people were very much astonished.' The\r\namanuensis, Ibn Djozay, here interpolates the following remark: 'I have\r\nseen, in a town in the valley of Almansura, in Spain,--which may God\r\ndefend!--a tower which shakes without the name of a caliph, or anybody\r\nelse, being mentioned.'\r\n\r\nAt the city of Idhedj, in Irak, then the capital of one of the many\r\nMongol sultans who at that time reigned in southern Persia, Ibn Batuta\r\ngives another proof of his boldness. Calling upon the Sultan Afrasiab,\r\nwho was notorious for his drunken and dissolute habits, the traveler\r\nfound him seated upon a divan, with two covered vases--one of gold and\r\none of silver--before him. A green carpet was brought and placed near\r\nhim, upon which the traveler was invited to take his seat, after which\r\nthe sultan asked him many questions concerning his travels. 'It seemed\r\nto me, however,' says Ibn Batuta, 'that he was quite intoxicated, for I\r\nhad been previously apprized of his habit of giving himself up to drink.\r\nFinally, he said to me in Arabic, which he spoke with elegance. \"Speak!\"\r\nI said to him, \"If thou wouldst listen to me, I would say to thee--Thou\r\nart one of the children of Sultan Ahmed, celebrated for his piety and\r\ndevotion; there is no cause of reproach to thee, in thy manner of life,\r\nexcept _that_!\" and I pointed with my finger to the two vases. These\r\nwords covered him with shame, and he was silent. I wished to withdraw,\r\nbut he ordered me to keep my seat, and said, \"It is a mark of the Divine\r\nmercy to meet with such as thou!\" Afterwards, seeing that he swayed from\r\nside to side, and desired to sleep, I left him. I had placed my sandals\r\nat the door, and could not find them again. The Fakir Fadhill sought for\r\nthem in the hall, and at last brought them to me. His kindness\r\nembarrassed me, and I made apologies. Thereupon he kissed my sandals,\r\nplaced them upon his head, in token of respect, and said to me, \"May God\r\nbless thee! What thou hast said to our sultan, nobody else would have\r\ndared to say. I hope it will make an impression on him!\"'\r\n\r\nContinuing his journey to Ispahan and Shiraz, he gives us, as usual,\r\nconscientious accounts of the mosques, priests, and holy men, but no\r\nhint whatever as to his manner of travel, or the character of the\r\ncountry through which he passed. This portion of his work, however,\r\ncontains many interesting historical fragments, relating to the reigns\r\nof the Mongol sultans of Persia, and the dissensions between the two\r\nMoslem sects. After a stay of some length at Shiraz, he returned through\r\nIrak to the celebrated city of Cufa, and thence to Bagdad, which was\r\nthen the residence of a simple Mongol prince. Here he describes at\r\nlength the mosques, colleges, mausoleums and baths, while Ibn Djozay\r\ntakes occasion to introduce his favorite quotations from the poets. The\r\nreader, we think, will find the following more picturesque than the\r\nsomewhat formal descriptions of Ibn Batuta:--\r\n\r\n  'Yea, Bagdad is a spacious place for him who's gold, to spend,\r\n  But for the poor it is the house of suffering without end:\r\n  I wander idly through its streets, as lost us if I were\r\n  A Koran in an atheist's house, which hath no welcome there.'\r\n  'A sigh, a sigh for Bagdad, a sigh for Irak's land!\r\n  For all its lovely peacocks, and the splendors they expand:\r\n  They walk beside the Tigris, and the looks they turn on me\r\n  Shine o'er the jeweled necklace, like moons above the sea!'\r\n\r\nOur traveler, also, was the forerunner of Layard. In visiting Mosul, he\r\nwrites: 'Near this place one sees the hill of Jonah, upon whom be\r\nblessing! and a mile distant from it the fountain which bears his name.\r\nIt is said that he commanded the people to purify themselves there; that\r\nafterwards they ascended the aforesaid hill; that he prayed, and they\r\nalso, in such manner that God turned the chastisement from their heads.\r\nIn the neighborhood is a great ruin, and the people pretend that it is\r\nthe remains of the city known under the name of Nineveh, the city of\r\nJonah. One perceives the vestiges of the wall which surrounded it, as\r\nwell as the situation of its gates. On the hill stands a large edifice,\r\nand a monastery, which contains numerous cells, apartments, places of\r\npurification, and fountains, all closed by a single gate. In the middle\r\nof the monastery one sees a cell with a silken curtain, and a door\r\nencrusted with gold and precious stones. This, they say, is the spot\r\nwhere Jonah dwelt; and they add that the choir of the mosque attached to\r\nthe monastery covers the cell in which he prayed to God.'\r\n\r\nReturning to Bagdad, Ibn Batuta crossed the Arabian Desert a second\r\ntime, and took up his residence in Mecca for the space of three years.\r\nHis account of the voyage along the eastern coast of Africa, as far\r\nsouth as Quiloa, is brief and uninteresting; but on his return he\r\nvisited Oman, of which province he gives us the first authentic account.\r\nFrom the Pearl Islands in the Persian Gulf, he bent his way once more\r\nacross Arabia to Mecca, whence he crossed the Red Sea to the Nubian\r\ncoast, and descended the Nile to Cairo. I shall omit his subsequent\r\njourneys through Syria and Asia Minor, although they contain many\r\namusing and picturesque incidents, and turn, instead, to his adventures\r\nin Kipchak (Southern Russia), which was then governed by a sultan\r\ndescended in a direct line from Genghis Khan. Embarking at Sinope, he\r\ncrossed the Black Sea to Caffa, in the Crimea, which was at that time a\r\nGenoese city. Here a singular circumstance occurred:--\r\n\r\n'We lodged in the mosque of the Mussulmans. After we had been resting\r\nthere about an hour, we suddenly heard the sound of bells resounding on\r\nall sides. I had then never heard such a sound; I was extremely\r\nterrified, and ordered my companions to ascend the minaret, read the\r\nKoran, praise God, and recite the call to prayer,--which they did. We\r\nnow perceived a man who had approached us: he was armed, and wore a\r\ncuirass. He saluted us, and we begged him to inform us who he was. He\r\ngave us to understand that he was the Kadi of the Mussulmans of the\r\nplace, and added: \"When I heard the reading of the Koran and the call to\r\nprayers, I trembled for your safety, and therefore came to seek you.\"\r\nThen he departed; but, nevertheless, we received nothing but good\r\ntreatment.'\r\n\r\nFrom Caffa, Ibn Eatuta traveled in a chariot to Azof, near which place\r\nhe found the camp of the Sultan Mohammed Uzbek Khan, of whose court he\r\ngives a very circumstantial description. He also devotes considerable\r\nspace to an account of their manner of keeping the fast of Ramadan. The\r\nfavorite wife of the sultan was a daughter of the Greek emperor, who at\r\nthe time of the traveler's visit was preparing to set out for\r\nConstantinople, in order that her expected child might be born in the\r\npalace of her fathers. 'I prayed the sultan,' says Ibn Batuta, 'to\r\npermit me to journey in company with the princess, in order that I might\r\nbehold Constantinople the Great. He at first refused, out of fear for my\r\nsafety, but I solicited him, saying, \"I will not enter Constantinople\r\nexcept under thy protection and thy patronage, and therefore I will fear\r\nno one.\" He then gave me permission to depart, making me a present of\r\nfifteen hundred ducats, a robe of honor, and a great number of horses.'\r\n\r\nThe journey to Constantinople was made entirely by land, and consumed\r\nmore than two months. It is rather difficult to locate the precise route\r\ntraversed by the caravan, except that it must have skirted the shore of\r\nthe Black Sea; for I find mention of three great canals, which must\r\nrefer to the three arms of the Danube. At the frontier of the Greek\r\nempire, they were received by the brothers of the princess, with a\r\nmounted guard. Ibn Batuta's chronology is a little confused, and we can\r\nonly guess that the reigning emperor at that time was Andronicus H.\r\nPalæologus. The description of the entry into Constantinople, and the\r\ninterview with the emperor, are among the most curious and interesting\r\npassages in the work.\r\n\r\n'We encamped at the distance of ten miles from Constantinople, and on\r\nthe following morning the population of the city came forth--men, women,\r\nand children, on foot and on horseback, in their most beautiful costumes\r\nand most magnificent vestments. From daybreak the cymbals, clarions, and\r\ntrumpets sounded; the soldiers mounted their horses, and the emperor,\r\nwith his wife, the mother of the princess, the great men of the empire,\r\nand the courtiers, issued from the city. Over the head of the emperor\r\nthere was a canopy, carried by a certain number of cavaliers and\r\nfoot-soldiers, holding in their hands long staves, terminated at the top\r\nby a sort of leather ball, with which they upheld the canopy. In the\r\ncentre thereof was a dais, supported on staves by the cavaliers. When\r\nthe emperor had advanced, the troops mixed together, and the noise\r\nbecame great. I was not able to penetrate into the middle of the crowd,\r\nand remained near the baggage of the princess and her companions,\r\nfearing for my safety. It was related to me that when the princess\r\napproached her parents, she alighted and kissed the ground before them;\r\nthen she kissed their shoes, and her principal officers did the same.\r\nOur entry into Constantinople the Great took place towards noon, or a\r\nlittle after. Meanwhile the inhabitants caused the bells to sound, in\r\nsuch measure that the heavens were shattered with the mixed uproar of\r\ntheir noise.\r\n\r\n'When we had arrived at the outer gate of the palace, we there found\r\nabout a hundred men, accompanied by their chief, who was stationed on a\r\nplatform. I heard them saying, \"The Saracens, the Saracens\"--a term by\r\nwhich they designate the Mussulmans,--and they prevented us from\r\nentering. The companions of the princess said to them. \"These people\r\nbelong to our suite;\" but they answered, \"They shall not enter here\r\nwithout permission.\" We therefore waited at the gate, and one of the\r\nofficers sent some one to inform her of this incident. She was then with\r\nher father, to whom she spoke concerning us. The emperor ordered us to\r\nbe admitted, and assigned us a house near that of the princess.\r\nFurthermore, he wrote, in our favor, an order prohibiting any one from\r\ninterrupting us in whatever part of the city we might go, and this was\r\nproclaimed in the markets. We remained three days in our residence,\r\nwhither they sent us provisions, namely, flour, bread, sheep, fowls,\r\nbutter, fish and fruits, also money and carpets.\r\n\r\n'On the fourth day after our arrival at Constantinople the princess sent\r\nto me the eunuch Sunbul, the Indian, who took me by the hand and\r\nconducted me into the palace. We passed four gates, near each one of\r\nwhich were benches, with armed men, the captain occupying a raised\r\nplatform covered with carpets. When we had reached the fifth gate, the\r\neunuch Sunbul left me and entered; then he returned, accompanied by four\r\nGreek eunuchs. These latter searched me, for fear lest I might have a\r\nknife about me. The chief said to me, \"Such is their custom; we can not\r\ndispense with a minute examination of whoever approaches the emperor,\r\nwhether a high personage or one of the people, a stranger or a native.\"\r\nThis is also the custom in India.\r\n\r\n'After I had submitted to this examination, the guardian of the gate\r\narose, took my hand, and opened. Four individuals surrounded me, two of\r\nwhom took hold of my sleeves, while the other two held me from behind.\r\nThey conducted me into a grand audience-hall, the walls of which were in\r\nmosaic; the figures of natural productions, whether animal or mineral,\r\nwere there represented. In the middle of the hall there was a brook,\r\nboth banks of which were bordered with trees; men stood on the right and\r\non the left, but no one spoke. In the centre of the hall of reception\r\nstood three other men, to whom my four conductors confided me, and who\r\ntook me by the garments as the first had done. Another individual having\r\nmade a sign to them, they advanced with me. One of them, who was a Jew,\r\nsaid to me in Arabic, \"Fear not; it is their custom to act thus towards\r\nstrangers. I am the interpreter, and am a native of Syria.\" I demanded\r\nof him what salutation I ought to make, and he replied, \"Say--May\r\nblessing be upon you!\"\r\n\r\n'I arrived, finally, at the grand dais, where I beheld the emperor\r\nseated on his throne, having before him his wife, the mother of the\r\nprincess. The latter, with her brothers, were stationed at the foot of\r\nthe throne. At the right of the sovereign there were six men, four at\r\nhis left, and as many behind him; all were armed. Before allowing me to\r\nsalute him, or to approach nearer to him, he made me a sign that I\r\nshould sit down for a moment, in order to recover from my fear. I did\r\nso, after which I advanced nearer, and saluted him. He invited me, by a\r\ngesture, to sit, but I did not comply. Then he questioned me on the\r\nsubject of Jerusalem, the blessed rock (of Jacob), the holy sepulchre,\r\nand the cradle of Jesus, Bethlehem and Hebron, Damascus and Cairo, Irak\r\nand Asia Minor. I replied to all his demands, the Jew performing the\r\noffice of interpreter between us. My words pleased him, and he said to\r\nhis children, \"Treat this man with consideration, and protect him!\" Then\r\nhe caused me to be clothed with a robe of honor, and assigned to me a\r\nhorse, saddled and bridled, as well as an umbrella from among those\r\nwhich were carried over his own head--which was a mark of protection. I\r\nprayed him to designate some one who should ride with me each day\r\nthrough the city, in order that I might behold its rarities and marvels,\r\nand speak of them in my own country. He granted my desire. One of the\r\ncustoms of this people is, that the individual who receives a robe of\r\nhonor from the emperor, and mounts a horse from his stables, must be\r\nconducted through the squares of the city, to the sound of trumpets,\r\nclarions and cymbals, so that the population may behold him. This is\r\noftenest done with those Turks who come from the dominions of the Uzbek\r\nsultan, in order that they may suffer no annoyance. I was conducted\r\nthrough the markets in the same manner.'\r\n\r\nBut the autumn night is closing in, and we must shut up the volume. We\r\ncan not, to-day, follow the brave old traveler through all the\r\nvicissitudes of his long pilgrimage. He allows us to perceive much that\r\nhe does not tell us outright, and it is a satisfaction to learn, from\r\nhis pages, that if society were less ordered, secure, and externally\r\nproper five hundred years ago, individual generosity and magnanimity\r\nwere more marked, and the good in the human race, as now, overbalanced\r\nthe evil. One more story Ibn Batuta must tell us, before we take leave\r\nof him,--one story, which must warm every heart which can appreciate\r\nthat rarest of virtues, tolerance. The father of the Greek emperor was\r\nstill living, having abdicated the crown in favor of his son Andronicus,\r\nand become a monk. The Moslem traveler thus describes his interview with\r\nthe old Christian monarch:--\r\n\r\n'I was one day in company with the Greek who was appointed to ride with\r\nme through the city, when we suddenly encountered the old emperor,\r\nwalking on foot, clothed in hair garments, and with a felt cap on his\r\nhead. He had a long white beard and a noble face, which presented traces\r\nof the pious practices whereto his life was devoted. Before and behind\r\nhim walked a troop of monks. He held a staff in his hand, and had a\r\nrosary about his neck. When the Greek beheld him, he alighted, and said\r\nto me, \"Dismount; it is the father of the emperor.\" When the Greek had\r\nsaluted him, he demanded who I was, then stopped, and summoned me to\r\nhim. I approached; he took my hand, and said to the Greek, who knew the\r\nArabic language,--\"Say to this Saracen (that is to say, Mussulman), that\r\nI press the hand which has entered Jerusalem, and the foot which has\r\nwalked by the Holy Rock, and the Holy Sepulchre, and in Bethlehem,\"\r\nHaving spoken, he placed his hand on my feet, and then passed it over\r\nhis own face. I was amazed at the respect which these people exhibit\r\ntowards an individual of another religion than their own, who has\r\nvisited the holy places. The old emperor then took me by the hand, and I\r\nwalked along with him. He questioned me on the subject of Jerusalem and\r\nthe Christians who dwell there. In his company I entered the consecrated\r\nground belonging to the church. As he approached the principal gate, a\r\ncrowd of priests and monks issued to salute him, for he was now one of\r\ntheir chiefs. When he saw them, he let go of my hand, and I said to him,\r\n\"I desire to enter the church with thee.\" He said to the interpreter,\r\n\"Inform him that whoever enters is absolutely obliged to prostrate\r\nhimself before the principal crucifix. It is a thing prescribed by the\r\nFathers, and can not be transgressed.\" I then left him, he entered\r\nalone, and I never saw him again.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE LATE LORD CHANCELLOR CAMPBELL.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of note that the English statesmen of the present century\r\nhave mostly originated in two totally distinct ranks of society. They\r\nhave either been the scions of noble and powerful families; or they have\r\narisen, in spite of circumstance, from humble parents, by the sole\r\nrecommendation of personal worth. Of the great middle class, the class\r\nwhich is certainly the most respectable of the English community, and\r\nwhich is at present the controlling power in the state, but few have\r\nrecently attained great eminence. That the titled and wealthy should\r\nadvance to power and influence in a government peculiarly influenced by\r\nsuch recommendations, is not strange. Any son of a great English house,\r\nwho has ambition, and a reasonable share of brains, may attain, with\r\ncomparative ease, eminence in the state. An apt example is Lord Russell,\r\nwho, with but little genius, with no oratorical force, and hardly more\r\nthan medium capacity as a statesman, has become the leader of the\r\npredominant party, by dint of shrewdness, a persevering spirit, and\r\nambition, backed by the powerful influence of the noble house of\r\nBedford. And that the master-spirits born in poverty should shake off\r\nthe incubus of humble birth, and advance to a level with the noblest, is\r\nnot so unnatural or improbable but that the history of every nation\r\naffords us abundant examples of such men; while the middle class, who\r\nare neither stimulated by the calls of penury, nor pushed forward by\r\nhereditary interest, naturally retain a contented mediocrity of renown\r\nand honor.\r\n\r\nIf any of our readers have visited the House of Lords within the past\r\ntwo years, they doubtless had their attention directed to the venerable\r\nstatesman who for that period has occupied, with eminent dignity and\r\ngrace, the office of chairman to that body, and whose recent decease has\r\nbeen noticed with such profound regret in British journals. On inquiry,\r\nthey doubtless learned that this was Lord Chancellor Campbell. He had\r\nrisen from the lowest drudgery to the highest eminence of the legal\r\nprofession. By the prolific arts of perseverance and industry, he had\r\nscaled each successive round in the ladder of promotion, until now, in\r\nhis declining years, with accumulated honor and respect, he had thus\r\nreached the summit, taking precedence after the Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury, holding the great seal, and presiding over the peers of the\r\nrealm.\r\n\r\nHe was one of those rare examples of unconquerable pluck, who have\r\nmastered the prejudice of wealth and power, and to whom has been yielded\r\na position envied by the most worthy descendants of the most illustrious\r\nnobles. In America, where public distinction is within the reach of all,\r\nit is difficult to conceive of the restraints which beset the humble\r\naspirant in the old country. But notwithstanding such obstacles, the\r\nexamples of such men as Eldon, Stowell, Truro, St. Leonards, Ashburton,\r\nCanning, and Campbell exhibit the gratifying fact, that hereditary power\r\nor wealth can not bide the dignity of great genius; that greatness will\r\nthrust aside the lesser privilege of worldly circumstance, whether it be\r\nborn in a palace or a cottage; and that you can no more control the\r\noperation of a superior mind by the vanities of title and lucre, than\r\nyou can subordinate truth to error, or eternity to time. The glittering\r\ntrain of peers and nabobs who followed in the path of the great\r\nElizabeth lie forgotten under the stately arches of the old cathedrals;\r\nwhile the poverty-stricken player, William Shakspeare, has adorned every\r\nlibrary with his name, and reigns in every appreciative heart, as a\r\nperfect master of nature and lofty thought. The names of the brilliant\r\ncourt which welcomed George the Third to the throne of the Plantagenets\r\nno longer linger on the lips of men; while every household boasts its\r\n'Rasselas,' and the civilized world holds sacred the memory of the\r\nillustrious 'Rambler.'\r\n\r\nJohn Campbell was born in 1781, and was the son of an obscure Scotch\r\nclergyman. His father destined him for the clergy; in consequence of\r\nwhich he was sent to the University of St. Andrews, where he met the\r\ngreat Dr. Chalmers, then a student like himself. But young Campbell\r\nbecame averse to the profession which had been chosen for him, and soon\r\nturned his attention to the law. Soon after graduation, he betook\r\nhimself to London, where he studied with great zeal, meanwhile supplying\r\nhis wants by acting as the theatrical critic of the '_Morning\r\nChronicle_.' There, seated in an obscure corner of the pit or upper\r\ngallery, we may imagine the Chancellor in embryo, jotting down the petty\r\nexcellences and failings of the players, to pamper the taste of the\r\nfrivolous on the morrow; while below him, in the decorated boxes and\r\ncircles, lolled the vain crowd of coroneted simpletons and courtly\r\nbeauties, now long forgotten, while he is honored as the benefactor of\r\nhis country's laws. He was called to the bar by the Society of Lincoln's\r\nInn, and then commenced a long life, replete with arduous study, with\r\nuntiring interest in duty, and stubborn perseverance. He early espoused\r\nthe liberal doctrines of Fox and Grey; and inasmuch as for many years\r\nafter the Tories monopolized the power, his politics were an effectual\r\nbar to his professional preferment. He remained, however, through his\r\nwhole life, an earnest and consistent advocate of his early convictions.\r\nOwing to the prejudice which Lord Chancellor Eldon entertained against\r\nthe Whigs, he did not obtain the silk gown of King's Counsel till the\r\nvenerable Jacobite gave place, in 1827, to the more courteous and\r\nliberal Lyndhurst.\r\n\r\nHe entered the House of Commons in the year 1830, and was soon\r\nrecognized as one of the leading members of the British bar. The period\r\nof his debut in public life is one of peculiar significance in the party\r\nhistory of England. The long dominion of the statesmen of the Pitt, and\r\nLiverpool school was at last overthrown. The political dogmas which had\r\nresisted Catholic toleration, which had sustained the continental powers\r\nin their persecution of the French Emperor, which had resisted the right\r\nof a neighboring people to choose their own rulers, which had held in\r\nimprisonment the first genius of the century, which had opposed the\r\nabolition of the test act, which had sustained the most licentious and\r\nmost obstinate sovereign of modern times, now yielded to the more\r\nenlightened views of such statesmen as Russell and Lansdowne, Brougham\r\nand Grey. Several causes operated to bring about this auspicious change.\r\nGeorge the Fourth, whose partiality for the Tories was only surpassed by\r\nhis animosity against the Whigs, had given place to a liberal and\r\nenlightened prince, renowned for his zealous attachment to the popular\r\nweal. Again, Canning's influence in moderating the maxims of Tory\r\ntheorists was greatly felt among the gentry. Finally, the rapid growth\r\nof general intelligence, developments in the history of nations, and\r\njuster conceptions of the true relations of sovereign and people,\r\nprepared the public mind for extensive reforms in the constitution. Earl\r\nGrey, a statesman eminent no less for his eloquence and sagacity than\r\nfor the worth of his private character, succeeded to the premiership in\r\n1830, being the first Whig who held that office since the cabinet of\r\n'all the talents,' in 1806.\r\n\r\nIt was at such a juncture that Campbell entered the House of Commons.\r\nThe sanguine dreams of his youth were dawning into reality; and he was\r\ngratified to see his cherished principles fully adopted by the country,\r\nand to know that he was a participant in the glories of the great\r\nreform.\r\n\r\nIn 1832, when he had been a member of the House but two years, and a\r\nKing's Counsel but five years, and in the same year that the reform of\r\nRussell and Grey received the royal sign-manual, he was elevated to the\r\ndignity of Solicitor General. No one of the long line of his illustrious\r\npredecessors brought to the discharge of this eminent trust greater\r\nlearning and acuteness than Lord Campbell evinced; who, at the same time\r\nof this appointment, was honored with the order of Knighthood. In 1834,\r\nafter serving as solicitor with the marked approbation of the\r\ngovernment, he was promoted to the Attorney Generalship.\r\n\r\nHe now re-entered Parliament as the representative of the capital of his\r\nnative Scotland, and became a leader in debate and the transaction of\r\nthe public business. He continued Attorney General through the\r\nconservative ministry of Sir Robert Peel, and the subsequent Whig\r\ngovernment of Lord Melbourne. In 1841, he held for a brief period the\r\nChancellorship of Ireland; being at the same time elevated to the rank\r\nof a peer of England, with the title of John, first Lord Campbell. He\r\nretired from office when Sir Robert Peel returned to power in the autumn\r\nof 1841, and turned his thoughts to the gentle and graceful pursuit of\r\nliterature. The first production of his pen was the 'Lives of the Lord\r\nChancellors,' from the earliest times to the close of Lord Eldon's\r\nChancellorship, in 1827. For the spirited interest of its style, the\r\nclear and precise detail of fact, and the simple yet elegant course of\r\nits manner, it is surpassed by no work of the present century. It is\r\nregarded by eminent critics as a masterpiece of biography, and may\r\njustly rank with the first books of that character in the English\r\ntongue. It has probably been as serviceable to perpetuate the name of\r\nthe author, if not more so, than the numerous profound and equitable\r\ndecisions which he has left on the records of the Courts of King's Bench\r\nand Chancery.\r\n\r\nIt was soon followed by 'The Lives of the Chief Justices of England,'\r\nwhich only enhanced the reputation of the former work; and we would\r\nheartily recommend both of these books to the perusal of all who are\r\ninterested, either professionally or as a matter of taste, in this\r\nbranch of literature, as a deeply interesting as well as instructive\r\nentertainment.\r\n\r\nIn 1846, Lord John Russell assumed office, and Lord Campbell was\r\nrecalled from the occupation which had proved so congenial to his mind,\r\nto take a seat in the ministry as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.\r\nWhile he held this position, he was a frequent and popular debater in\r\nthe House of Peers, where he zealously defended the policy of the\r\ngovernment. In 1850, Lord Chief Justice Denman retired from the King's\r\nBench, ripe in years and in honorable renown, and Lord Campbell was at\r\nonce designated as his successor. In this exalted place, he was removed\r\nfrom the harassing uncertainties of political life; and he continued for\r\nnine years to administer justice with promptitude, skill, and equity.\r\n\r\nIt was while Chief Justice that he became eminent for the great light he\r\nbrought to bear upon many important and intricate questions of law; and\r\nhis fame may be said to rest mainly upon the profound ability with which\r\nhe exercised the functions of this trust. In 1859, when Lord Palmerston\r\nsucceeded to the brief administration of Lord Derby, Lord Campbell was\r\nfinally raised to the summit of his profession. He was the fourth\r\nScotchman who has been Lord Chancellor within the century, and is a\r\nworthy compeer of such men as Loughborough, Erskine, and Brougham. The\r\nlong years of unremitting toil were at length crowned with glorious\r\nsuccess; and the great man died in the midst of duty, affluence, honor\r\nand power, while enjoying the prerogatives of the highest judicial\r\ntrust, during the summer of the past year.\r\n\r\nWhether we consider him as a lawyer, statesman, author, or man, his\r\ncharacter appears in a most amiable light. Profound without pedantry,\r\nsubtle without craft, zealous without bigotry, and humane without\r\neffeminacy, he lived a philanthropic, pure, and consistent life. His\r\nhighest eulogium is that he lived and died in the service of his\r\ncountry; that through every vicissitude his chief care was the national\r\nweal; that his chief fame rests in the love and veneration which he\r\nawakened in his countrymen; and that few Englishmen of the present\r\ncentury have left more enduring monuments of public wisdom and private\r\nexample.\r\n\r\n  'O, civic music, to such a name,\r\n  To such a name for ages long,\r\n  To such a name,\r\n  Preserve the broad approach of fame,\r\n  And ever ringing avenues of song.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCHILD'S CALL AT EVENTIDE.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Bright and fair,--\r\n     Golden hair,\r\n  Still white hands and face;\r\n     Not a plea\r\n     Moveth thee;\r\n  Nor the wind's wild chase,\r\n   As yesterday, calling thee,\r\n  Even as I, in vain.\r\n   Come--wake up, Gerda!\r\n  Come out and play in the lane!\r\n\r\n     See! the wind,\r\n     From behind,\r\n  Sporteth with thy locks,\r\n     From the land's\r\n     Desert sands\r\n  And the sea-beat rocks\r\n   Cometh and claspeth thy hands,\r\n  Even as I, in vain.\r\n   Come--wake up, Gerda!\r\n  Come out and play in the lane!\r\n\r\n     Closed thine eyes,\r\n     Gently wise,\r\n  Dost thou dream the while?\r\n     Falls my kiss\r\n     All amiss,\r\n  Waketh not a smile!\r\n   Sweet mouth, is't feigning this?\r\n  Then do not longer feign.\r\n   Come--wake up, Gerda!\r\n  Come out and play in the lane!\r\n\r\n     Forehead Bold,\r\n     White and cold;\r\n  Sealed thy lips and all;\r\n     I am made\r\n     Half afraid\r\n  In this lonely hall.\r\n   Night cometh quick through the glade!\r\n  I fear it is all in vain,--\r\n   All too late, Gerda,--\r\n  Too late to play in the lane!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE GOOD WIFE: A NORWEGIAN STORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I.\r\n\r\nNOTHING LOST BY GOOD HUMOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more than a month I had been ransacking my memory in search of some\r\nstory or narrative to offer our readers, but with rather poor success. I\r\nthought of all the good things I had ever heard, and tumbled and tossed\r\nmy books in vain--nothing could I find that was suitable for either\r\nchildren or parents. So I was, very reluctantly, about to abandon the\r\nenterprise, when it chanced that, being unable to compose myself to\r\nsleep, a few nights since, I took up, according to my custom on such\r\noccasions, an old copy of Montaigne, the usual companion of my vigils,\r\nthe fellow-occupant of my pillow, and the only moralist whose musings\r\none can read with pleasure on the wrong side of forty.\r\n\r\nI opened the _Essays_ carelessly, for each and every page of them is\r\nprecious and replete with themes for meditation. In so doing, I alighted\r\nupon the chapter entitled, 'Of three Good Women,'--which commences thus:\r\n'They are not to be found by the dozen, as every one knows, and\r\nespecially not in the duties of married life, for that is a market full\r\nof such thorny circumstances that it is no easy matter for a woman's\r\nwill to keep whole and sound in it for any length of time.'\r\n\r\n'Montaigne is an impertinent fellow!' I exclaimed, slamming to the book.\r\n'What? this close reader of antiquity, this fine analyst of the human\r\nheart, has been able to find only three good women, only three devoted\r\nwives, in all the Greek and Roman annals! This is playing the joker out\r\nof season. Goodness is the special attribute of woman. Every married\r\nwoman is good, or supposed to be such. I bethink me, too, that our old\r\njurists always make the law presume this goodness to exist, at the\r\noutset,'\r\n\r\nThus meditating, I wandered into my library, and there took up a fine\r\nold volume, bound in red morocco, and entitled 'The Dream of Vergier;' a\r\nbook full of wisdom and logic, and written by some venerable clerk,\r\nduring the reign of Charles V., king of France. I looked for the page\r\nthat had struck my fancy, but--alas! how oddly one's memory changes with\r\nthe lapse of years--instead of finding, in that grave old book, the just\r\npanegyric of woman's goodness, I discovered, to my great surprise, only\r\na violent satire all spiced with texts borrowed from St. Augustine, the\r\nRoman laws and the ancient canons, with this sage conclusion, full\r\nworthy of the exordium:--\r\n\r\n'I do not say, however, that there is no good woman at all, but the\r\nspecies is rare; and hence an old law says that no _law concerning good\r\nwomen_ should be made, for that laws are to be made concerning things of\r\nusual occurrence, as it is written in _Auth. sinc prohib_., etc., _quia\r\nvero_ and L. _Nam ad ca_, Dig. _De Leffibus_.'\r\n\r\nThese juridical epigrams, these cool pleasantries, in a serious book,\r\nshocked me more than even the hard hits of the Gascon philosopher. 'Good\r\nwomen,' I thought to myself, 'are found everywhere. In history? No;\r\nhistory is written by men who love and admire heroes only, that is to\r\nsay, those who rob, subjugate, or slay them. In theology? No; it has not\r\nyet forgiven the daughters of Eve the fault which ruined us,--a sin of\r\nwhich they have retained at least a little share. In the records of the\r\nlaw, then? No, again; for men make the laws. Woman is, in their eyes,\r\nnothing but a minor, legally incapable of governing herself. God only\r\nknows what is, here, as in all things, the difference between the fact\r\nand the law. Are these good women to be found in plays, romances, or\r\nnovels? No, still; for they are but the perpetual recital of feminine\r\nartfulness. Where, then, shall we look for good women?--In the realm of\r\nfable and fiction, in the kingdom of fancy--the dominion of the ideal.\r\n\r\nThese are the only regions in which merit holds the place it is entitled\r\nto or justice is done to the claims of virtue. What is the tenderness of\r\nBaucis, or the long fidelity of Penelope? Fiction only. And the\r\nresignation of the gentle Griseldis--what is it? An old tale of other\r\ndays. In order to find the good woman we are looking for, this is the\r\nivory portal at which we must knock.\r\n\r\nActing upon this conviction, I reperused all the old traditions, I\r\ncalled to my aid that peculiar lore of nations which is embodied in\r\ntheir legends, and which is so vividly, so amiably, and so ingenuously\r\nexpressed. I interrogated the story-tellers of every country, Indian,\r\nPersian, Arabic, Turkish, Chinese, Italian, Spanish, French, German,\r\nEnglish, Dutch, Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Russian, Lithuanian, and\r\neven the hoary old wayside narrators of the far Thibet. I plunged into\r\nthis ocean of fancy with the recklessness of an accomplished diver,\r\nbut,--must I acknowledge it?--less fortunate than even Montaigne with\r\nhis history, I have succeeded in bringing back only one woman that I can\r\ncall really good, and her I have had to disinter from under the ice and\r\nsnows of the North, in a wild country, too, and among a people who are\r\nnot so delicate and refined as though Paris were in Norway. From Cadiz\r\nto Stockholm, from London to Cairo and Delhi, from Paris to Teheran and\r\nSamarcand, if the stories are to be believed, there are artful girls and\r\nscheming mothers, in any quantity; but the _good woman_!--where does she\r\nlie hid, and why do they never tell us anything about her? Here is a\r\nhiatus to which I specially call the attention of the learned. In\r\nobserving it myself, I feel the more emboldened to relate the story of\r\nthe only good woman and wife I have unearthed. It is a simple narrative,\r\nand not thoroughly in accordance with every-day experience, and, indeed,\r\nthere may be some squeamish people who will say that it is ridiculous.\r\nNo matter--it has one good quality which no one can dispute--it is not\r\nin the ordinary style of either adventure or narration. Novelty is all\r\nthe rage at the present day, and what imparts value to things is not\r\ntheir intrinsic merit, but their strangeness.\r\n\r\nHere, then, is my story presented to you, kind reader, just as Messrs.\r\nAsbjoernsen and Moe give it, in their curious collection of Norwegian\r\ntales and legends.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\nGUDBRAND AND HIS WIFE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was once a man called Gudbrand, who lived in a lonely little\r\nfarm-house on a remote hillside. From this circumstance he got the name\r\namong his neighbors of Gudbrand of the Hill.\r\n\r\nNow, you must know that Gudbrand had an excellent wife, as sometimes\r\nhappens to a man. But the rarest thing about it was, that Gudbrand knew\r\nthe value of such a treasure; and so the two lived in perfect harmony,\r\nenjoying their own happiness, and giving themselves no concern about\r\neither wealth or the lapse of years. No matter what Gudbrand might do,\r\nhis wife had foreseen and desired that very thing; so that her good man\r\ncould not touch or change or move anything about the house without her\r\ncoming forward to thank him for having divined and forestalled her\r\nwishes.\r\n\r\nBesides, it was easy for them to get along, since the farm belonged to\r\nthem, and they had a hundred solid crowns in a drawer of their closet\r\nand two excellent cows in their stable. They lacked nothing, and could\r\nquietly pass their old age without fear of poverty or toil, and without\r\nhaving to look to the friendship or the commiseration of any of their\r\nfellow-creatures.\r\n\r\nOne evening, while they were talking over their various little tasks and\r\nprojects, says the wife of Gudbrand to her husband,--\r\n\r\n'Husband, I've got a new notion in my head: you must take one of our\r\ncows to town and sell her. We'll keep the other, and she'll be quite\r\nenough to furnish us with all the milk and butter we can use. Why\r\nshould we toil for other people? We've money lying in the drawer, and\r\nhave no children to look after. So, wouldn't it be better to spare these\r\narms of ours, now that they are growing old? You will always find\r\nsomething to occupy your time about the house;--there'll be no lack of\r\nfurniture and things to mend, and I'll be more than ever beside you with\r\nmy distaff and my knitting-needles.'\r\n\r\nGudbrand bethought him that his wife was right, as usual, and so, as the\r\nnext morning was a beautiful one, he set off for the town, at an early\r\nhour, with the cow he wanted to sell. But it was not market day, and he\r\nfound no purchaser to take the animal off his hands.\r\n\r\n'Well! well!' said Gudbrand, 'at all events, I can take Sukey back to\r\nthe place I brought her from; I've got hay and litter in plenty, there,\r\nfor the poor brute, and it's no farther returning than it was coming\r\nhither.' Whereupon, he very quietly started again on the road to his\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nAfter walking on for a few hours, and just as he was beginning to feel a\r\nlittle tired, he met a man leading a horse by the bridle toward the\r\ntown. The horse was in fine condition, and was all saddled and ready for\r\na rider. 'The way is long and night rapidly coming on,' thought\r\nGudbrand. 'I can hardly drag my cow along, and to-morrow I'll have to\r\ntake this same walk over again. Now, here's an animal that would suit me\r\na great deal better, and I'd go back home with him, as proud as a lord.\r\nWho would be delighted to see her husband returning in triumph, like a\r\nRoman general? Why, the wife of Gudbrand!'\r\n\r\nUpon this happy thought, Gudbrand stopped the trader and exchanged his\r\ncow for the horse.\r\n\r\nOnce mounted on the charger's back, our hero felt some qualms of regret,\r\nfor he was old and heavy, while the horse was young, frisky, and\r\nheadstrong, so that, in less than half an hour, behold, our would-be\r\ncavalier was on foot again, vainly striving to drag along by the bridle\r\na creature that cocked up his head at every puff of wind, and capered\r\nand pranced at every stone that lay in his path.\r\n\r\n'This is a poor bargain I've made,' thought Gudbrand, when, just at that\r\nmoment, he descried a peasant driving along a hog so fine and fat that\r\nits stomach touched the ground.\r\n\r\n'A nail that is useful is better than a diamond that glitters and can be\r\nturned to nothing, as my wife often says,' reflected Gudbrand; and, with\r\nthat, he traded off his horse for the hog.\r\n\r\nIt was a bright idea to be sure, but our good man had counted without\r\nhis host. Don Porker was tired, and wouldn't budge an inch. Gudbrand\r\ntalked to him, coaxed him, swore at him, but all in vain; he dragged him\r\nby the snout, he pushed him from behind, he whacked him on both his fat\r\nsides with a cudgel, but it was only labor lost, and Mr. Hog remained\r\nthere in the middle of the dusty road like a stranded whale. The poor\r\nfarmer was yielding to despair, when, at the very nick of time, there\r\ncame along a country lad leading a she-goat, that, with an udder all\r\nswollen with milk, skipped, ran, and played about, in a manner charming\r\nto behold.\r\n\r\n'There! that's the very thing I want!' exclaimed Gudbrand. 'I'd far\r\nrather have that gay, sprightly creature than this huge, stupid brute.'\r\nWhereupon, without an instant's hesitation, he exchanged the hog for the\r\nshe-goat.\r\n\r\nAll went well for another half-hour. The young madam with her long horns\r\ngreatly amused Gudbrand, who laughed at her pranks till his sides ached.\r\nIn fact, too, the goat pulled him along; but, when one is on the wrong\r\nside of forty, one soon gets tired of scrambling over the rocks; and so\r\nthe farmer, happening to meet a shepherd feeding his flock, traded his\r\nshe-goat for a ewe. 'I'll have just as much milk,' mused he, 'from that\r\nanimal as from the other, and, at least, she will keep quiet, and not\r\nworry either my wife or me.'\r\n\r\nGudbrand was right, in one respect, for there is nothing more gentle\r\nthan a ewe. This one had no tricks; she neither capered nor butted with\r\nher head, but she stood perfectly still and bleated all the time.\r\nFinding herself separated from her companions, she wanted to rejoin\r\nthem, and the more Gudbrand tugged at her tether, the more piteously she\r\nbaaed.\r\n\r\n'Deuce take the silly brute!' shouted Gudbrand; 'she's as obstinate and\r\nwhimpering as my neighbor's wife. Who'll rid me of this bawling,\r\nbellowing little beast? I must get clear of her, at any price.'\r\n\r\n'It's a bargain, if you choose, neighbor,' said a country fellow who was\r\njust passing, with a fat goose under his arm. 'Here, take this fine\r\nbird, instead; she's worth two of that ugly sheep that's going to split\r\nits throat in less than an hour, anyhow.'\r\n\r\n'Done!' said Gudbrand; 'a live goose is as good as a dead ewe, any day;'\r\nand so he took the goose in exchange.\r\n\r\nBut it was no easy matter to manage his new bargain. The goose turned\r\nout to be a very disagreeable companion; for, finding itself no longer\r\non the ground, it fought with its bill, its feet, and its wings, so that\r\nGudbrand was soon tired of struggling to hold it.\r\n\r\n'Pah!' growled he; 'the goose is an ugly, ill-grained creature, and my\r\nwife never would have one about the house.' With this reflection, he\r\nchanged the goose, at the first farm-house he came to, for a fine\r\nrooster of rich plumage and furnished with a grand pair of spurs.\r\n\r\nThis time, he was thoroughly satisfied. The rooster, it is true,\r\nsquawked from time to time, in a voice rather too hoarse to gratify most\r\ndelicate ears; but as his claws had been tied together with twine and he\r\nwas carried head downwards, he finally gave up and resigned himself to\r\nhis fate. The only unpleasant circumstance now remaining was that the\r\nday was rapidly drawing to a close. Gudbrand, who had started before\r\ndawn, now found himself fasting, at sundown, without a farthing in his\r\npocket. He still had a long walk before him, and the good man felt that\r\nhis legs were giving out and that his stomach craved refreshment. Some\r\nbold step must be taken; and so, at the first wayside tavern, Gudbrand\r\nsold his rooster for a shilling, and as he had a raging appetite, he\r\nspent the last doit of it for his supper.\r\n\r\n'After all,' said he, the while, 'what use would a rooster be to me, if\r\nI had to die of hunger?'\r\n\r\nAs he, at length, drew near his own dwelling, however, Gudbrand began to\r\nmeditate seriously on the curious turn things had taken with him, and,\r\nbefore entering his home, he stopped at the door of Peter the Gray\r\nbeard, as a neighbor of his was called in the surrounding country.\r\n\r\n'Well, neighbor,' said Peter, 'how have you prospered in the town?'\r\n\r\n'Oh! so, so,' answered Gudbrand; 'I can't say that I've been very lucky,\r\nnor have I much to complain of either;' and he went on to tell all that\r\nhad happened.\r\n\r\n'Neighbor, you've made a pretty mess of it!' said Peter the Graybeard;\r\n'you'll have a nice time of it when you get home. Heaven protect you\r\nfrom your dame! I wouldn't be in your shoes for ten crowns.'\r\n\r\n'Good!' rejoined Gudbrand of the Hill; 'things might have turned out\r\nstill worse for me; but, now, I'm quiet in my mind about it, for my wife\r\nis so clever that, right or wrong, no matter what I've done, well or\r\nill, she'll not say one word about it.'\r\n\r\n'I hear and admire your statement, neighbor,' retorted Peter, 'but, with\r\nall respect for you, I do not believe a word of it.'\r\n\r\n'Will you lay a wager on it?' said Gudbrand. 'I have a hundred crowns in\r\nmy drawer at home, and I'll bet twenty of them against as many from\r\nyou.'\r\n\r\n'Done, on the spot!' replied Peter. So, joining hands on it, the two\r\nfriends entered Gudbrand's house. Peter stood back at the door to hear\r\nwhat the husband and wife would have to say.\r\n\r\n'Good evening, wife!' said Gudbrand. 'Good evening, husband,' said the\r\ngood woman; 'you've come back, then, God be praised! How did you fare\r\nall day?'\r\n\r\n'Neither well nor ill,' replied Gudbrand. When I got to the town, I\r\ncould find no one there to buy our cow, and so I traded her off for a\r\nhorse.'\r\n\r\n'For a horse!' said the wife. 'An excellent idea, and I thank you with\r\nall my heart. We can go to church, then, in a wagon, like plenty of\r\nother folks who look down upon us, but are no better than we. If we\r\nchoose to keep a horse and can feed him, we have a right to do it, I\r\nsuppose, for we ask no odds of anybody. Where is the horse? We must put\r\nhim into the stable.'\r\n\r\n'I did not bring him all the way home,' answered Gudbrand, 'for, on the\r\nroad, I changed my mind; I exchanged the horse for a hog.'\r\n\r\n'Come, now,' said the wife, 'that's just what I'd have done, in your\r\nplace! Thanks, a hundred times over! Now, when my neighbors come to see\r\nme, I'll have, like everybody else, a bite of ham to offer them. What\r\nneed had we of a horse? The folks around us would have said, \"See the\r\nsaucy things! they think it beneath them to walk to church.\" Let us put\r\nthe hog in a pen!'\r\n\r\n'I didn't bring him with me,' said Gudbrand, 'for on the way I exchanged\r\nhim for a she-goat.'\r\n\r\n'Bravo!' said the good wife. 'What a sensible man you are! When I come\r\nto think of it, what could I have done with a hog? The neighbors would\r\nhave pointed us out and have said, \"Look at those people--all they make\r\nthey eat! But, with a she-goat, I shall have milk and cheese, not to\r\nspeak of the little kids. Come, let us put her into the stable.\"\r\n\r\n'I didn't bring the she-goat with me, either,' said Gudbrand; 'I traded\r\nher again, for a ewe.'\r\n\r\n'There! That's just like you,' exclaimed the wife, with evident\r\nsatisfaction. 'It was for my sake that you did that. Am I young enough\r\nto scamper, over hill and dale, after a she-goat? No, indeed. But, a ewe\r\nwill yield me her wool as well as her milk; so let us get her housed at\r\nonce.'\r\n\r\n'I didn't bring the ewe home, either,' stammered Gudbrand, once more,\r\n'but swapped her for a goose.'\r\n\r\n'What? a goose! oh! thanks, thanks a thousand times, with all my\r\nheart--for, after all, how could I have got along with the ewe? I have\r\nneither card nor comb, and spinning is a heavy job, at best. When you've\r\nspun, too, you have to cut and fit and sew. It's far easier to buy our\r\nclothes ready-made, as we've always done. But a goose--a fat one, too,\r\nno doubt--why, that's the very thing I want! I've need of down for our\r\nquilt, and my mouth has watered this many a day for a bit of roast\r\ngoose. Put the bird in the poultry-coop.'\r\n\r\n'Ah! I've not brought the goose, for I took a rooster in his stead.'\r\n\r\n'Good husband!' said the wife, 'you're wiser than I would have been. A\r\nrooster! splendid!--why, a rooster's better than an eight-day clock. The\r\nrooster will crow every morning, at four, and tell us when it is time to\r\npray to God and set about our work. What would we have done with a\r\ngoose? I don't know how to cook one, and as for the quilt, Heaven be\r\npraised, there's no lack of moss a great deal softer than down. So, let\r\nus put the rooster in the corn-yard!'\r\n\r\n'I have not brought even the rooster,' murmured Gudbrand, 'for, at\r\nsundown, I felt very hungry, and had to sell my rooster for a shilling\r\nto buy something to eat. If it hadn't been for that I must have starved\r\nto death.'\r\n\r\n'God be thanked for giving you that lucky thought,' replied the wife.\r\n'All that you do, Gudbrand, is just after my own heart. What need we of\r\na rooster? We are our own masters, I think; there is no one to give us\r\norders, and we can stay in bed just as long as we please. Here you are,\r\nmy dear husband, safe and sound. I am perfectly satisfied, and have need\r\nof nothing more than your presence to make me happy.'\r\n\r\nUpon this, Gudbrand opened the door;--'Well! neighbor Peter, what do you\r\nsay to that? Go, now, and bring me your twenty crowns!' So saying,\r\nGudbrand hugged and kissed his wife with as much fervor and heartiness\r\nas though he and she had just been wedded, in the bloom of youth.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III.\r\n\r\nBut the narrative does not end with the events described in the last\r\nchapter. There is a reverse to every medal, and even daylight would not\r\nbe so charming were it not followed by night. However good and perfect\r\nwoman may, generally, be, there are some who by no means share the easy\r\ndisposition of Gudbrand's better half. Need I say that the fault is,\r\nusually, in the husband? If he were only to yield, on all occasions,\r\nwould he be troubled? Yield? exclaim some fierce moustachioed\r\nindividuals. Yes, indeed, yield, or hear the penalty that awaits you.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART IV.\r\n\r\nPETER THE GRAYBEARD.\r\n\r\n\r\nPeter the Graybeard did not at all resemble Gudbrand. He was\r\nself-willed, imperious, passionate, and had no more patience than a dog\r\nwhen you snatch away his bone or a cat when you're trying to strangle\r\nher. He would have been insufferable, had not Heaven, in its mercy,\r\ngiven him a wife who was a match for him. She was headstrong,\r\nquarrelsome, discontented and morose--always ready to keep quiet when\r\nher husband preserved silence, and just as ready to scream at the top of\r\nher voice the moment he opened his mouth.\r\n\r\nIt was great good fortune for Peter to have such a spouse. Without her,\r\nwould he ever have known that patience is not the merit of fools?\r\n\r\nOne day, in the mowing Season, when he came home, after a fifteen hours'\r\nspell of hard work, in worse humor than usual, and was swearing, cursing\r\nand execrating all women and their laziness, because his soup was not\r\nyet ready for him, his wife exclaimed,--\r\n\r\n'Good Lord! Peter, you talk away at a fine rate. Would you like to\r\nchange places? To-morrow, I will mow, instead of you, and you stay at\r\nhome here and play housekeeper. Then, we'll see which of us will have\r\nthe hardest task and come out of it the best.'\r\n\r\n'Agreed!' thundered Peter; 'you'll have a chance to find out, once for\r\nall, what a poor husband has to suffer. The trial will teach you a\r\nlesson of respect--something you greatly need.'\r\n\r\nSo, the next morning, at day-break, the wife set out afield with the\r\nrake over her shoulder and the sickle by her side, all joyous at the\r\nsight of the bright sunshine, and singing like a lark.\r\n\r\nNow, who felt not a little surprised, and a little foolish too, to find\r\nhimself shut up at home? Our friend Peter the Graybeard. Still, he\r\nwasn't going to own himself beaten, but fell to work churning butter, as\r\nthough he had never done anything else all the days of his life.\r\n\r\nIt's no hard matter to get over-heated when one takes up a new trade,\r\nand Peter soon, feeling very dry, went down into the cellar to draw a\r\nmug of beer from the cask. He had just knocked out the bung and was\r\napplying the spigot, when he heard an ominous crunching and grunting\r\noverhead. It was the sow, devastating the kitchen.\r\n\r\n'Oh Lord! my butter's lost!' yelled Peter the Graybeard, as he rushed\r\npell-mell up the steps, with the spigot in his hand. What a spectacle\r\nwas there! the churn upset, the cream spilt all over the floor, and the\r\nhuge sow fairly wallowing in the rich and savory tide.\r\n\r\nNow even a wiser man would have lost all patience; as for Peter, he\r\nrushed upon the brute, who, with piercing screams, strove to escape; but\r\nit was a hapless day to the thief, for her master caught her in the\r\ndoorway and dealt her so well applied and vigorous a blow on the side of\r\nher skull with the spigot that the sow fell dead on the spot.\r\n\r\nAs he drew back his novel weapon, now covered with blood, Peter\r\nrecollected that he had not closed the bung-hole of his cask, and that\r\nall this time his beer was running to waste. So down he rushed again to\r\nthe cellar. Fortunately, the beer had ceased to run, but then that was\r\nbecause not a drop remained in the cask.\r\n\r\nHe had now to begin his morning's work again, and churn some more butter\r\nif he expected to see any dinner that day. So Peter visited the\r\ndairy-house, and there found enough cream to replaced what he had just\r\nlost. At it he goes again, and churns and churns away, more vigorously\r\nthan ever. But, in the midst of his churning, he remembers--a little\r\nlate to be sure, but better late than never--that the cow was still in\r\nthe stable, and that she had neither food nor water, although the sun\r\nwas now high above the horizon. Away he runs then to the stable. But\r\nexperience has made him wise: 'I've my little child there rolling on the\r\nfloor; now, if I leave the churn, the greedy scamp will turn it over,\r\nand something worse might easily happen!' Whereupon, he takes up the\r\nchurn on his back and hastens to the well to draw water for the cow. The\r\nwell was deep, and the buckets did not go down far enough. So Peter\r\nleans with all his might, in hot haste, on the rope, and away goes the\r\ncream out of the churn, over his head and shoulders, into the well!\r\n\r\n'Confound it!' said Peter between his teeth, 'it's clear that I'm to\r\nhave no butter to-day. Let's attend to the cow; it's too late to take\r\nher out to pasture, but there's a fine lot of hay on the house-thatch\r\nthat hasn't been cut, and so she'll lose nothing by staying at home.' To\r\nget the cow out of the stable and to put her on the house-roof was no\r\ngreat trouble, for the dwelling was set in a hollow in the hill-side, so\r\nthat the thatch was almost on a level with the ground. A plank served\r\nthe purpose of a bridge, and behold the cow comfortably installed in her\r\nelevated pasture! Peter, of course, could not remain upon the roof to\r\nwatch the animal; he had to make the mid-day porridge and take it to the\r\nmowers. But he was a prudent man, and did not want to leave his cow\r\nexposed to the risk of breaking her bones; so he tied a small rope\r\naround her neck, and this rope he passed carefully down the chimney of\r\nthe cottage into the kitchen below. Having effected this, he descended\r\nhimself, and, entering the kitchen, attached the other end of the rope\r\nto his own leg.\r\n\r\n'In this way,' said he, 'I make sure that the cow will keep quiet, and\r\nthat nothing bad can happen to her.'\r\n\r\nHe now filled the kettle, dropped into it a good 'lump' of lard, the\r\nnecessary vegetables and condiments, placed it on the well-piled fagots,\r\nstruck fire with flint and steel, and was applying the match to the\r\nwood, blowing it well the while, when, all at once, crish--crash! away\r\ngoes the cow, slipping down over the roof, and dragging our good man,\r\nwith one leg in the air and head downwards, clear up the chimney. What\r\nwould have become of him, no one could tell, had not a thick bar of iron\r\narrested his upward flight. And now there they are, both together,\r\ndangling in the air, the cow outside and Peter within; both, too,\r\nuttering the most frightful cries of distress.\r\n\r\nAs good luck would have it, the wife was just as impatient as her\r\nhusband, and, when she had waited just three seconds to see whether\r\nPeter would bring her porridge at the stated time, she darted off for\r\nthe house as though it were on fire. When she saw the cow swinging\r\nbetween heaven and earth, she drew her sickle and cut the rope, greatly\r\nto the delight of the poor brute, who now found herself safe again, on\r\nthe only sort of floor she liked. It was a chance no less fortunate for\r\nPeter, who was not accustomed to gazing at the sky with his feet in the\r\nair. But he fell smack into the kettle, head foremost. It had been\r\ndecreed, however, that all should come out right with him, that day; the\r\nfire had died out, the water was cold, and the kettle awry, so that he\r\ngot off with nothing worse than a scratched forehead, a peeled nose, and\r\ntwo well scraped cheeks, and, thank Heaven! nothing was broken but the\r\nsaucepan.\r\n\r\nWhen his better half entered the kitchen, she found Master Graybeard\r\nlooking very sheepish and bloody.\r\n\r\n'Well! well!' said she, planting her arms akimbo and her two fists on\r\nher haunches: 'who's the best housekeeper, pray? I have mowed and\r\nreaped, and here I am as good as I was yesterday, while you, _you_,\r\nMister Cook, Mister Stay-at-home, Mr. Nurse, where is the butter,\r\nwhere's the sow, where's the cow, and where's our dinner? If our little\r\none's alive yet, no thanks to you. Poor little fellow!--what would\r\nbecome of it without kind and careful mamma?'\r\n\r\nWhereupon, Mrs. Peter begins to snivel and sob. Indeed, she has need to,\r\nfor is not sensibility woman's field of triumph, and are not tears the\r\ntriumph of sensibility?\r\n\r\nPeter bore the storm in silence, and did well, for resignation is the\r\nvirtue of great souls!\r\n\r\n\r\nPART V.\r\n\r\nThere, you have my story exactly as it is related, on winter evenings,\r\nto impress ideas of wisdom on the minds of the young Norwegians. Between\r\nthe wife of Gudbrand and the wife of Peter the Graybeard they must\r\nchoose, at their own risk and peril.\r\n\r\n'The choice is an easy one,' says an amiable lady-friend of mine, who\r\nhas just become a grandmother. 'Gudbrand's wife is the one to imitate,\r\nnot only on account of her prudence, but for her worth. You men are much\r\nmore amusing than you fancy: when your own self-esteem is at stake, you\r\nlove truth and justice about as much as bats love a glare of light. The\r\ngreatest enjoyment these gentlemen experience is in pardoning us when\r\nthey are guilty, and in generously offering to overlook our errors when\r\nthey alone are in the wrong. The wisest thing we can do is to let them\r\ntalk, and to pretend to believe them. That is the way to tame these\r\nproud, magnificent creatures, and, by pursuing the plan perseveringly,\r\none may lead them about by the nose, like Italian oxen.\r\n\r\n'But, aunty,' says a fair young thing beside us, 'one can't keep quiet\r\nall the time. Not to yield when you're not in the wrong, is a right.'\r\n\r\n'And when you're wrong, my dear niece, to yield is a royal pleasure.\r\nWhat woman ever abandoned this exalted privilege? We are all somewhat\r\nakin to that amiable lady who, when all other arguments had been\r\nexhausted, crushed her husband with a magnificent look, as she said,--\r\n\r\n'\"Sir, I give you my word of honor that I am in the right.\"\r\n\r\n'What could he reply? Can one contradict the veracity of one's own wife?\r\nAnd what is strength fit for if not to yield to weakness? The poor\r\nhusband hung his head, and did not utter another word. But to keep still\r\nis not to acknowledge defeat, and _silence is not peace_!'\r\n\r\n'Madame,' says a young married woman, 'it seems to me that there is no\r\nchoice left; when a woman loves her husband all is easy; it is a\r\npleasure to think and act as he does.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, my child, that is the secret of the comedy. Every one knows it,\r\nbut no one avails herself of it. So long as even the last glow of the\r\nhoney-moon illuminates the chamber of a young couple, all goes along of\r\nitself. So long as the husband hastens to anticipate every wish, we have\r\nmerit and sense enough to let him do it. But at a later moment, the\r\nscene changes. How, then, are we to retain our sway? Youth and beauty\r\ndecay, and the charm of wit and intelligence is not sufficient. In order\r\nto remain mistresses of our homes, we must practice the most divine of\r\nall the virtues--gentleness--a blind, dumb, deaf gentleness of demeanor,\r\nthat pardons everything for the sake of pardoning.'\r\n\r\nTo love a great deal,--to love unconditionally, so as to be loved a\r\nlittle in return,--that is the whole moral of the story of Gudbrand.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE HUGUENOT FAMILIES IN AMERICA.\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe brave Admiral Coligny first conceived the plan of a colony in\r\nAmerica for the safety of his persecuted Huguenot brethren of France.\r\nSuch an enterprise was undertaken as early as the year 1555, with two\r\nvessels, having on board mechanics, laborers, and gentlemen, and a few\r\nministers of the Reformed faith. They entered the great river which the\r\nPortuguese had already named _Rio Janeiro_, and built a fort, calling it\r\n'Coligny.' Here they sought a new country, where they might adore God in\r\nfreedom. Unforeseen difficulties, however, discouraged these bold\r\nFrenchmen, and the pious expedition failed, some dispersing in different\r\ndirections, while others regained the shores of France with great\r\ndifficulty. A second attempt was also unsuccessful. Coligny, in 1562,\r\nobtained permission from Charles IX. to found a Protestant colony in\r\nFlorida. Two ships left Dieppe with emigrants, and, reaching the\r\nAmerican shores, entered a large, deep river called _Port Royal_, which\r\nname it still retains, and is, by coincidence, the spot recently\r\ncaptured by the United States forces.[F] Fort Charles, in honor of the\r\nreigning king of France, was built near by, and in a fertile land of\r\nflowers, fruits, and singing birds. The country itself was called\r\n_Carolina_. Reduced to the most cruel extremities of famine and death,\r\nthe remaining colonists returned to Europe.\r\n\r\nStill undismayed by these two disastrous attempts, Coligny, the Huguenot\r\nleader, dispatched a third expedition of three vessels to our shores,\r\nmaking another attempt near the mouth of the St. John's River (Fort\r\nCaroline). Philip II. was then on the throne, and would not brook the\r\nheresy of the Huguenots, or Calvinism, in his American provinces.\r\nPriests, soldiers, and Jesuits were dispatched to Florida, where the new\r\nsettlers, 'Frenchmen and Lutherans,' were destroyed in blood. Such was\r\nthe melancholy issue of the earliest attempts to establish a Huguenot or\r\nProtestant settlement in North America. And nearly one hundred years\r\nbefore it was occupied by the English, Carolina, for an instant, as it\r\nwere, was occupied by a band of Christian colonists, but, through the\r\nremorseless spirit of religious persecution, again fell under the\r\ndominion of the uncivilized savages. We refer to these earliest efforts\r\nas proper to the general historical connection of our subject, although\r\nnot absolutely necessary to its investigation.\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of the seventeenth century, England, on her own\r\nbehalf, took up the generous plans of Coligny. Possessing twelve\r\ncolonies in America, when the edict of Nantes was revoked, that nation\r\nresolved here to offer peaceful homes to persecuted Huguenots from\r\nFrance. This mercy she had extended to them in England and Ireland; now\r\nher inviting American colonies were thrown open for the same generous\r\npurpose. Even before that insane and fatal measure of Louis XIV., the\r\nRevocation, and especially after the fall of brave La Rochelle, numerous\r\nProtestant fugitives, mostly from the western provinces of France, had\r\nalready emigrated, for safety, to British America. In 1662 the French\r\ngovernment made it a crime for the ship-owners of Rochelle to convey\r\nemigrants to any country or dependency of Great Britain. The fine for\r\nsuch an offence was ten livres to the king, nine hundred for charitable\r\nobjects, three hundred to the palace chapel, one hundred for prisoners,\r\nand five hundred to the mendicant monks. One sea-captain, Brunet, was\r\naccused of having favored the escape of thirty-six young men, and\r\ncondemned to return them within a year, or to furnish a legal\r\ncertificate of their death, on pain of one thousand livres, with\r\nexemplary punishment.[G] It is imagined that these young voluntary\r\nHuguenot exiles emigrated to Massachusetts, from the fact that the same\r\nyear when this strange cause was tried in France, Jean Touton, a French\r\ndoctor, requested from the authorities of that colony the privilege of\r\nsojourning there. This favor was immediately granted; and from that\r\nperiod _Boston_ possessed establishments formed by Huguenots, which\r\nattracted new emigrants.\r\n\r\nIn 1679, Elie Nean, the head of an eminent family from the principality\r\nof Soubise, in Saintonge, reached that city. This refugee, sailing\r\nafterwards in his own merchant vessel for the island of Jamaica, was\r\ncaptured by a privateer, carried back to France, confined in the\r\ngalleys, and only restored to his liberty through the intercession of\r\nLord Portland.\r\n\r\nOne of the first acts of the Boston Huguenots was to settle a minister,\r\ngiving him forty pounds a year, and increasing his salary afterwards.\r\nSurrounded by the savages on every side, they erected a fort, the traces\r\nof which, it is said, can still be seen, and now overgrown with roses,\r\ncurrant bushes, and other shrubbery. Mrs. Sigourney, herself the wife of\r\na Huguenot descendant, during a visit to this time-honored spot, wrote\r\nthe beautiful lines,--\r\n\r\n  'Green vine, that mantlest in thy fresh embrace\r\n  Yon old gray rock, I hear that thou with them\r\n  Didst brave the ocean surge.\r\n              Say, drank thus from\r\n  The dews of Languedoc? or slow uncoiled\r\n  An infant fibre 'mid the faithful mold\r\n  Of smiling Roussillon? Didst thou shrink\r\n  From the fierce footsteps of fighting unto death\r\n  At fair Rochelle?\r\n  Hast thou no tale for me?'\r\n\r\nTheir fort did not render the French settlers safe from the murderous\r\nassaults of savage enemies. A.W. Johnson, with his three children, were\r\nmassacred here by them; his wife was a sister of Mr. Andrew Sigourney,\r\none of the earliest Huguenots. After this murderous attack the French\r\nProtestants deserted their forest home, repairing to Boston in 1696,\r\nwhere vestiges of their industry and agricultural taste long remained;\r\nto this day many of the pears retain their French names, and the region\r\nis celebrated for its excellence and variety of this delicious fruit.\r\nThe Huguenots erected a church at Boston in 1686, and ten years\r\nafterwards received as pastor a refugee minister from France, named\r\nDiaillé.[H] The Rev. M. Lawrie is also mentioned as one of their\r\npastors. But from official records we learn more of the Rev. Daniel\r\nBoudet, A.M. He was a native of France, born in 1652, and studied\r\ntheology at Geneva. On the revocation, he fled to England, receiving\r\nholy orders from the Lord Bishop of London. In the summer of 1686 he\r\naccompanied the Huguenot emigrants to Massachusetts; and Cotton Mather\r\nspeaks of him as a faithful minister 'to the French congregation at New\r\nOxford, in the _Nipmog_ (Indian) counties.' This was New Oxford, near\r\nBoston. He labored for eight years, 'propagating the Christian faith,'\r\nboth among the French and the Indians. He complains, as we do in our\r\nday, of the progress of the sale of rum among the savages,'_without\r\norder or measure_' (July 6, 1691). We shall learn more of him at New\r\nRochelle, where he removed, probably, in 1695, and could preach to both\r\nEnglish and French emigrants. Soon after the revocation of the Edict of\r\nNantes, Joseph Dudley, with other proprietors, introduced into\r\nMassachusetts thirty French Protestant families, settling them on the\r\neasternmost part of the 'Oxford tract.'[I]\r\n\r\nMassachusetts, peopled in part by the rigid Protestant Dissenters,\r\nnaturally favored these new victims, persecuted by a church still more\r\nodious to them than that of England. Their sympathies were deeply\r\nexcited by the arrival of the French exiles. The destitute were\r\nliberally relieved, the towns of Massachusetts making collections for\r\nthis purpose, and also furnishing them with large tracts of land to\r\ncultivate. In 1686 the colony at Oxford thus received a noble grant of\r\n11,000 acres; and other provinces followed the liberal example. Every\r\ntraveler through New England has seen 'Faneuil Hall,' which has been\r\ncalled the 'Cradle of Liberty,' and where so many assemblages for the\r\ngeneral good have been held. This noble edifice was presented to Boston,\r\nfor patriotic purposes, by the son of a Huguenot.\r\n\r\nMuch of our knowledge concerning the Huguenots of New York has been\r\nobtained from the documentary papers at Albany. Some of the families,\r\nbefore the revocation, as early as the year 1625, reached the spot where\r\nthe great metropolis now stands, then a Dutch settlement. The first\r\nbirth in New Amsterdam, of European parents, was a daughter of George\r\nJansen de Rapelje, of a Huguenot family which fled to Holland after the\r\nSt. Bartholomew's massacre, and thence sailed for America. Her name was\r\nSarah. Her father was a Walloon from the confines of France and Belgium,\r\nand settling on Long Island, at the _Waal-bogt_, or Walloon's Bay,\r\nbecame the father of that settlement. In 1639 his brother, Antonie\r\nJansen de Rapelje, obtained a grant of one hundred 'morgens,' or nearly\r\ntwo hundred acres of land, opposite Coney Island, and commenced the\r\nsettlement of Gravesend. Here most numerous and respectable descendants\r\nof this Walloon are met with to this day. Jansen de Rapelje, as he was\r\ncalled, was a man of gigantic strength and stature, and reputed to be a\r\nMoor by birth. This report, probably, arose from his adjunct of _De\r\nSalee_, the name under which his patent was granted; but it was a\r\nmistake; he was a native Walloon, and this suffix to his name, we doubt\r\nnot, was derived from the river Saale, in France, and not Salee, or Fez,\r\nthe old piratical town of Morocco. For many years after the Dutch\r\ndynasty, his farm at Gravesend continued to be known as Anthony Jansen's\r\nBowery. The third brother of this family, William Jansen de Rapelje, was\r\namong the earliest settlers of Long Island and founders of Brooklyn.\r\nSingularly, the descendants of _Antonie_ have dropped the Rapelje, and\r\nretained the name of Jansen, or Johnson, as they are more commonly\r\ncalled. On the contrary, George's family have left off Jansen, and are\r\nnow known as Rapelje or Rapelyea.\r\n\r\nMost of the Huguenots who went to Ulster, N.Y., at first sought\r\ndeliverance from persecutions among the Germans, and thence sailed for\r\nAmerica. Ascending the Hudson, these emigrants landed at Wiltonyck, now\r\nKingston, and were welcomed by the Hollanders, who had prepared the way\r\nin this wilderness for the enjoyment of civil and religious liberty.\r\nHere was a Reformed Dutch church, and Hermanus Blomm, its pastor,\r\ncommissioned by the Classis of Amsterdam to preach 'both on water and on\r\nthe land, and in all the neighborhood, but principally in _Esopus_.'\r\nThis region, selected by the French Protestants for their future land,\r\nwas like their own delightful native France for great natural beauties.\r\nTowards the east and west flowed the waters of the noble ever-rolling\r\nHudson, while on the north the Shamangunk Mountains, the loftiest of our\r\nFishkill monarchs, looked like pillars upon which the arch of heaven\r\nthere rested. No streams can charm the eye more than those which enrich\r\nthis region,--the Rosendale, far from the interior, the Walkill, with\r\nits rapid little falls, 'the foaming, rushing, warsteed-like' Esopus\r\nCreek, with the dashing, romantic Saugerties, fresh from the\r\nmountain-side. Both the Dutch and the French emigrants followed these\r\nbeautiful rivers towards the south, and made their earliest settlements\r\nthere. On these quiet and retired banks their ashes repose. Hallowed be\r\ntheir memories, virtues, and piety! In those regions thousands of their\r\ndescendants now enjoy the rich and glorious patrimony which have\r\nfollowed their industry and frugality.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1663, the savages attacked Kingston and massacred a part of\r\nits inhabitants, slaying twenty-four, and took forty-five prisoners.\r\nThe dominie, Blomin, escaped, and has left a description of the tragical\r\nevent.[J] 'There lay,' he writes, 'the burnt and slaughtered bodies,\r\ntogether with those wounded by bullets and axes. The last agonies and\r\nthe moans and lamentations were dreadful to hear.... The houses were\r\nconverted into heaps of stones, so that I might say with Micah, \"We are\r\nmade desolate;\" and with Jeremiah, \"A piteous wail may go forth in his\r\ndistress.\" With Paul I say, \"Brothers, pray for us.\" I have every\r\nevening, during a whole month, offered up prayers with the congregation,\r\non the four points of our fort, under the blue sky.... Many heathen have\r\nbeen slain, and full twenty-two of our people have been delivered out of\r\ntheir hands by our arms. The Lord our God will again bless our arms, and\r\ngrant that the foxes who have endeavored to lay waste the vineyard of\r\nthe Lord shall be destroyed.'\r\n\r\nAmong the prisoners were Catharine Le Fever, the wife of Louis Dubois,\r\nwith three of their children. These were Huguenots; and a friendly\r\nIndian gave information where they could be found. The pursuers were\r\ndirected to follow the Rondout, the Walkill, and then a third stream;\r\nand a small, bold band, with their knapsacks, rifles, and dogs,\r\nundertook the perilous journey. Towards evening, Dubois, in advance of\r\nthe party, discovered the Indians within a few feet of him, and one was\r\nin the act of drawing his bow, but, missing its string, from fear or\r\nsurprise, the Huguenot sprang forward and killed him with his sword, but\r\nwithout any alarm. The party then resolved to delay the attack until\r\ndark; at which hour the savages were preparing for slaughter one of\r\ntheir unfortunate captives, which was none other than the missing wife\r\nof Dubois himself. She had already been placed upon the funeral pile,\r\nand at this trying moment was singing a martyr's psalm, the strains of\r\nwhich had often cheered the pious Huguenots in days of the rack and\r\nbloody trials. The sacred notes moved the Indians, and they made signs\r\nto continue them, which she did, fortunately, until the approach of her\r\ndeliverers. 'White man's dogs! white man's dogs!' was the first cry\r\nwhich alarmed the cruel foes. They fled instantly, taking their\r\nprisoners with them. Dubois calling his wife by name, she was soon\r\nrestored to her anxious friends, with the other captives. At the moment\r\nof their rescue, the prisoners were preparing for the bloody sacrifice\r\nto savage cruelty, and singing the beautiful psalm of the 'Babylonish\r\nCaptives.' Heaven heard those strains, and the deliverance came. During\r\nthis fearful expedition the Ulster Huguenots first discovered the rich\r\nlowlands of Paltz.\r\n\r\nThis was the section which they selected for their homes, distant some\r\neighty-five miles from New York, along the west shores of the Hudson,\r\nand extending from six to ten miles in the interior. It was called _New\r\nPaltz_, and its patent obtained from Gov. Andreas; twelve of their\r\nbrethren were religiously selected by the emigrants as the _Patentees_,\r\nand known by the appellation of the '_Duzine_,' or the twelve patentees,\r\nand these were regarded as the patriarchs in this little Christian\r\ncommunity. A list of the original purchasers has been preserved, and\r\nwere as follows: Louis Dubois, Christian Dian, since Walter Deyo,\r\nAbraham Asbroucq, now spelt Hasbrouck, Andros Le Fever, often Le Febre\r\nand Le Febore, John Brook, said to have been changed into Hasbrouck,\r\nPeter Dian, or Deyo, Louis Bevier, Anthony Cuspell, Abraham Du Bois,\r\nHugo Freir, Isaac Dubois, Simon Le Fever.\r\n\r\nA copy of this agreement with the Indians still exists, and the\r\nantiquarian may find it among the State records at Albany. It is a\r\ncurious document, with the signatures of both parties, the patentees'\r\nwritten in the antique French character, with the hieroglyphic marks of\r\nthe Indians. A few Indian goods--kettles, axes, beads, bars of lead,\r\npowder, casks of wine, blankets, needles, awls, and a 'clean\r\npipe'--were the insignificant articles given, about two centuries ago,\r\nfor these lands, now proverbially rich, and worth millions of dollars.\r\nThe treaty was mutually executed, according to the records from which we\r\nquote, on the 20th of May, 1677.\r\n\r\nThe patentees immediately took possession of their newly-acquired\r\nproperty, their first conveyances being three wagons, which would be\r\nrare curiosities in our day. The wheels were very low, shaped like\r\nold-fashioned spinning-wheels, with short spokes, wide rim, and without\r\nany iron. The settlers were three days on their way from Kingston to New\r\nPaltz, a distance of only sixteen miles. The place of their first\r\nencampment is still known by the name of '_Tri Cor_,' or three cars, in\r\nhonor of these earliest conveyances. Soon, however, they selected a more\r\nelevated site, on the banks of the beautiful Walkill, where the village\r\nnow stands. Log houses were erected not far apart, for mutual defence,\r\nand afterwards stone edifices, with port-holes, some of which still\r\nremain.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMACCARONI AND CANVAS.\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nRome is the cradle of art,--which accounts for its sleeping there.\r\n\r\nNature, however, is nowhere more wide awake than it is in and around\r\nthis city: therefore, Mr. James Caper, animal painter, determined to\r\nrepose there for several months.\r\n\r\nThe following sketches correctly describe his Roman life.\r\n\r\n\r\nARRIVAL IN ROME.\r\n\r\nIt was on an Autumn night that the traveling carriage in which sat James\r\nCaper arrived in Rome; and as he drove through that fine street, the\r\nCorso, he saw coming towards him a two-horse open carriage, filled with\r\nRoman girls of the working class (_minenti_). Dressed in their\r\npicturesque costumes, bonnetless, their black hair tressed with flowers,\r\nthey stood up, waving torches, and singing in full voice one of those\r\nsongs in which you can go but few feet, metrically speaking, without\r\nmeeting _amore_. And then another and another carriage, with flashing\r\ntorches and sparkling-eyed girls. It was one of the turnouts of the\r\n_minenti_; they had been to Monte Testaccio, had drank all the wine they\r\ncould pay for; and, with a prudence our friend Caper could not\r\nsufficiently admire, he noticed that the women were in separate\r\ncarriages from the men. It was the Feast Day of Saint Crispin, and all\r\nthe cobblers, or artists in leather, as they call themselves, were\r\nkeeping it up bravely.\r\n\r\n'Eight days to make a pair of shoes?' he once asked a shoemaker. 'Si,\r\nSignore, there are three holidays in that time.' Argument unanswerable.\r\n\r\nAs the carriages rolled by, Caper determined to observe the festivals.\r\n\r\nThe next day our artist entered his name in his banker's register, and\r\nhad the horror of seeing it mangled to 'Jams Scraper' in the list of\r\narrivals published in the _Giornale di Roma_. For some time after his\r\narrival in Rome, he was pained to receive cards, circulars, notices,\r\nletters, advertisements, etc., from divers tradesmen, all directed to\r\nthe above name. In revenge, he here gives them a public airing. One firm\r\nannounces,--\r\n\r\n'Manafactury of Remain Seltings, Mosaïques, Cameas, Medalls, Erasofines,\r\n&c.' (Erasofines is the Roman-English for crucifixes.) And on a slip of\r\npaper, handsomely printed, is an announcement that they make 'Romain\r\nPerles of all Couloueurs'--there's color for you!\r\n\r\nA tailor, under the head of '_Ici un parle Français_,' prints, 'Merchant\r\n_and_ tailor. Cloths (clothes?) Reddy maid, Mercery Roman; Scarfs, etc.'\r\n\r\nAnother, 'Roman Artickles Manofactorer'--hopes to be 'honnoured with our\r\nCustom, (American?), and flaters himsself we will find things to our\r\nlikings.' Everything but the English, you know--that is not exactly to\r\nour liking. Another, from a lady, reads,--\r\n\r\n_A VENTRE!_\r\n\r\n_une Galérie decomposée de 300 d'Anciens Maitres, et de l'école romaine\r\npeintres sur bois, sur cuivre et sur toit, &c._\r\n\r\n_Ventre_ for _Vendre_ is bad enough, but a 'gallery of decomposed old\r\nmasters and of Roman school painters on wood and on the roof,' when it\r\nwas intended to say 'A gallery composed of 300 of the old masters--' But\r\nlet us leave it untranslated; it is already _decomposée_.\r\n\r\n\r\nA SHORT WALK.\r\n\r\nMr. Caper having indignantly rejected the services of all professors of\r\nthe guiding art or 'commissionaires,' slowly sauntered out of his hotel\r\nthe morning after his arrival, and, map in hand, made his way to the\r\ntower on the Capitoline Hill. Threading several narrow, dirty streets,\r\nhe at last went through one where in one spot there was such a heap of\r\ngarbage and broccoli stumps that he raised his eyes to see how high up\r\nit reached against the walls of a palace; and there read, in black\r\nletters,\r\n\r\n_Immondezzaio_;\r\n\r\nliterally translated, A Place for Dirt. On the opposite wall, which was\r\nthe side of a church, he saw a number of black placards on which were\r\nlarge white skulls and crossbones, and while examining these, a\r\nbare-headed, brown-bearded, stout Franciscan monk passed him. From a\r\npassing glance, Caper saw he looked good-natured, and so, hailing him,\r\nasked why the skulls and bones were pasted there.\r\n\r\n'Who knows?' answered the monk. 'I came this morning from the Campagna;\r\nthis is the first time in all my life I have been in this magnificent\r\ncity.'\r\n\r\n'Can you tell me what that word means up there?' said Caper, pointing to\r\n_immondezzaio_.\r\n\r\n'Signore, I can not read.'\r\n\r\n'Perhaps it is the name of the street, maybe of the city?'\r\n\r\n'It must be so,' answered the priest, 'unless it's a sign of a lottery\r\noffice, or a caution against blasphemy up and down the pavement. Those\r\nare the only signs we have in the country, except the government salt\r\nand cigar shops.' ... He took a snuff-box from a pocket in his sleeve,\r\nand with a bow offered a pinch to Mr. Caper. This accepted, they bid\r\neach other profoundly farewell.\r\n\r\n'There goes a brick!' remarked the traveler.\r\n\r\nArrived at the entrance-door to the tower of the Capitoline Hill, James\r\nCaper first felt in one pocket for a silver piece and in the other for a\r\nmatch-box, and finding them both there, rang the bell, and then mounted\r\nto the top of the tower. Lighting a _zigarro scelto_ or papal cigar, he\r\nleaned on both elbows on the parapet, and gazed long and fixedly over\r\nthe seven-hilled city.\r\n\r\n'And this,' soliloquized he, _is_ Rome. Many a day have I been kept in\r\nschool without my dinner because I was not able to parse thee idly by,\r\n_Roma_--Rome--noun of the first declension, feminine gender, that a\r\nquarter of a century ago caused me punishment, I have thee now literally\r\nunder foot, and (knocking his cigar) throw ashes on thy head.\r\n\r\n'My mission in this great city is not that of a picture-peddler or art\r\nstudent. I come to investigate the eating, drinking, sleeping\r\narrangements of the Eternal City--its wine more than its vinegar, its\r\npretty girls more than its galleries, its _cafés_ more than its\r\nchurches. I see from here that I have a fine field to work in. Down\r\nthere, clambering over the fallen ruins of the Palace of the Cæsars, is\r\na donkey. Could one have a finer opportunity to see in this a moral and\r\ntwist a tail? From those fallen stones, Memory-glorious old\r\narchitect--rears a fabric wondrously beautiful; peoples it with eidolons\r\nwhite and purple-robed, and gleaming jewel-gemmed; or, iron armed,\r\nglistening with flashing light from polished steel--heroes and slaves,\r\nconquerors and conquered; my blood no longer flows to the slow, jerking\r\nmeasure of a nineteenth-century piece of mechanism, but freely, fully,\r\nand completely. Hurrah, my blood is up! dark, liquid eyes; black,\r\nflowing locks; strange, pleasing perfumes are around me. There is a rush\r\nas of a strong south wind through a myriad of floating banners, and I am\r\nborne onward through triumphal arches, past pillared temples, under the\r\nwalls of shining palaces, into the Coliseum....\r\n\r\n'Pray, and can you tell me--if that pile of d----d old rubbish--down\r\nthere, you know--is the Forum--for I do not--see it in Murray--though\r\nI'm sure--I have looked very clearly--and Murray you know--has\r\neverything down in him--that a traveler....\r\n\r\n'A commercial traveler?' ... interrupted Mr. Caper, speaking slowly, and\r\nlooking coolly into the eyes of the blackguard Bagman.... 'The ruins you\r\nsee there are those of the Forum. Good morning.'\r\n\r\n\r\nMODERN ART.\r\n\r\n'Lucrezia Borgia at the Tomb of Don Giovanni! You see,' said the artist,\r\n'I have chosen a good name for my painting, ... and it's a great point\r\ngained. Forty or fifty years ago, some of those fluffy old painters\r\nwould have had Venus worshiping at the shrine of Bacchus.'\r\n\r\n'Whereas, you think it would be more appropriate for her to worship\r\nGiove?' ... asked Capar.\r\n\r\n'No _sir_!... I run dead against classic art: it's a drug. I tried my\r\nhand at it when I first came to Rome. Will you believe me, I never sold\r\na picture. Why that very painting'--pointing to the Borgia--'is on a\r\ncanvas on which I commenced The Subjugation of Adonis.'\r\n\r\n'H'm! You find the class of Middle Age subjects most salable then?'\r\n\r\n'I should think I did. Something with brilliant colors, stained glass\r\nwindows, armor, and all that, sells well. The only trouble is,\r\nultramarine costs dear, although Dovizzelli's is good and goes a great\r\nways. I sold a picture to an Ohio man last week for two hundred dollars,\r\nand it is a positive fact there was twenty _scudi_ (dollars) worth of\r\nblue in it. But the infernal Italians spoil trade here. Why, that fellow\r\nwho paints Guide's Speranzas up there at San Pietro in Vineulo is as\r\nsmart as a Yankee. He has found out that Americans from Rhode Island\r\ntake to the Speranza, because Hope is the motto of their State, and he\r\nturns out copies hand over fist. He has a stencil plate of the face, and\r\nthree or four fellows to paint for him; one does the features of the\r\nface, another the hand, and another rushes in the background. Why, sir,\r\nthose paintings can be sold for five _scudi_, and money made on them at\r\nthat. But then what are they? Wretched daubs not worth house-room. Have\r\nyou any thoughts of purchasing paintings?'\r\n\r\nCaper smiled gently.... 'I had not when I first came to Rome, but how\r\nlong I may continue to think so is doubtful. The temptations' (glancing\r\nat the Borgia) 'are very great.' ...\r\n\r\n'Rome,' ... interrupted the artist, ... 'is the cradle of art.'\r\n\r\n\r\nA ROOM HUNT.\r\n\r\nCaper, on his first arrival in Home, went to the Hotel Europe, in the\r\nPiazza di Spagna. There for two weeks he lived like a _milordo_. He\r\nformed many acquaintances among the resident colony of American artists,\r\nand was received by them with much kindness. Some of the mercenary ones\r\nof their number, having formed the opinion that he came there to buy\r\npaintings, ignorant of his profession, were excessively polite;--but\r\ntheir offers of services were declined. When Caper finally moved to\r\nprivate lodgings in Babuino Street and opened a studio, hope for a\r\nseason bade these salesmen all farewell; they groaned, and owned that\r\nthey had tried but could not sell.\r\n\r\nAmong the acquaintances formed by Caper, was a French artist named\r\nRocjean. Born in France, he had passed eight or ten years in the United\r\nStates, learned to speak English very well, and was residing in Rome 'to\r\nperfect himself as an artist.' He had, when Caper first met him, been\r\nthere two years. In all this time he had never entered the Vatican, and\r\nhaving been told that Michael Angelo's Last Judgment was found to have a\r\nflaw in it, he had been waiting for repairs before passing his opinion\r\nthereon. On the other hand, he had studied the Roman _plebe_, the\r\npeople, with all his might. He knew how they slept, eat, drank, loved,\r\nmade their little economies, clothed themselves, and, above all, how\r\nthey blackguarded each other. When Caper mentioned to him that he wished\r\nto leave his hotel, take a studio and private lodgings, then Rocjean\r\nexpanded from an old owl into a spread eagle. Hurriedly taking Caper by\r\nthe arm, he rushed him from one end of Rome to the other, up one\r\nstaircase and down another; until, at last, finding out that Rocjean\r\ninvariably presented him to fat, fair, jolly-looking landladies\r\n(_padrone_), with the remark, 'Signora, the Signor is an Englishman and\r\nvery wealthy,' he began to believe that something was wrong. But Rocjean\r\nassured him that it was not--that, as in Paris, it was Madame who\r\nattended to renting rooms, so it was the _padrona_ in Rome, and that the\r\nremark, 'he is an Englishman, and very wealthy,' were synonymous, and\r\nalways went together. 'If I were to tell them you were an American it\r\nwould do just as well--in fact, better, but for one thing, and that is,\r\nyou would be swindled twice as much. The expression \"and very wealthy,\"\r\nattached to the name of an Englishman, is only a delicate piece of\r\nflattery, for the majority of the present race of traveling English are\r\nby no means lavish in their expenditures or very wealthy. In taking you\r\nto see all these pretty women, I have undoubtedly given you pleasure, at\r\nthe same time I have gratified a little innocent curiosity of mine:--but\r\nthen the chance is such a good one! We will now visit the Countess ----,\r\nfor she has a very desirable apartment to let; after which we will\r\nproceed seriously to take rooms with a home-ly view.'\r\n\r\nThe Countess ---- was a very lovely woman, consequently Caper was\r\nfascinated with the apartment, and told her he would reflect over it.\r\n\r\n'Right,' said Rocjean, after they had left; 'better reflect over it than\r\nin it--as the enormous draught up chimney would in a short time compel\r\nyou to.'\r\n\r\n'How so?'\r\n\r\n'I have a German friend who has rooms there. He tells me that a cord of\r\nfirewood lasts about long enough to warm one side of him; when he turns\r\nto warm the other it is gone. He has lived there three years reflecting\r\nover this; the Countess occasionally condoles with him over the draught\r\nof that chimney.'\r\n\r\n'H'm! Let us go to the homely: better a drawn sword than a draught.'\r\n\r\nThey found a homely landlady with neat rooms in the via Babuino, and\r\nhaving bargained for them for twelve _scudi_ a month, their labors were\r\nover.\r\n\r\n\r\nMACCARONICAL.\r\n\r\nThere was, when Caper first came to Rome, an eating-house, nearly\r\nopposite the fountain Trevi, called the Gabioni. It was underground,--in\r\nfact, a series of cellars, popularly conjectured to have been part of\r\nthe catacombs. In one of these cellars, resembling with its arched roof\r\na tunnel, the ceiling so low that you could touch the apex of the round\r\narch with your hand, every afternoon in autumn and winter, between the\r\nhours of five and six, there assembled, by mutual consent, eight or ten\r\nartists. The table at which they sat would hold no more, and they did\r\nnot want it to. Two waiters attended them, Giovanni for food, Santi for\r\nwine and cigars. The long-stemmed Roman lamps of burnished brass, the\r\nbowl that held the oil and wicks resembling the united prows of four\r\nvessels, shedding their light on the white cloth and white walls, made\r\nthe old place cheerful. The white and red wine in the thin glass flasks\r\ngleamed brightly, and the food was well cooked and wholesome. Here in\r\nearly winter came the sellers of 'sweet olives,' as they called them,\r\nand for two or three cents (_baiocchi_) you could buy a plateful. These\r\nolives were green, and, having been soaked in lime-water, the bitter\r\ntaste was taken from them, and they had the flavor of almonds.\r\n\r\nBut the maccaroni was the great dish in the Gabioni; a four-cent plate\r\nof it would take the sharp edge from a fierce appetite, assisted as it\r\nwas by a large one-cent roll of bread. There was the white pipe-stem and\r\nthe dark ribbon (_fettucia_) species; and it was cooked with sauce (_al\r\nsugo_), with cheese, Neapolitan, Roman and Milan fashion,\r\nand--otherways. Wild boar steaks came in winter, and were cheap. Veal\r\nnever being sold in Rome until the calf is a two-year-old heifer, was no\r\nlonger veal, but tender beef, and was eatable. Sardines fried in oil and\r\nbatter were good. Game was plenty, and very reasonable in price, except\r\nvenison, which was scarce. The average cost of a substantial dinner was\r\nfrom thirty to forty baiocchi, and said Rocjean, 'I can live like a\r\nprince--like the Prince B----, who dines here occasionally--for half\r\nthat sum.'\r\n\r\nThe first day Caper dined in the Gabioni, what with a dog-fight under\r\nthe table, cats jumping upon the table, a distressed marchioness (fact)\r\nbegging him for a small sum, a beautiful girl from the Trastevere,\r\nshining like a patent-leather boot, with gold ear-rings, and brooch, and\r\nnecklace, and coral beads, who sat at another table with a French\r\nsoldier--these and those other little _piquante_ things, that the\r\ntraveler learns to smile at and endure, worried him. But the dinner was\r\ngood, his companions at table were companionable, and as he finished an\r\nextra _foglietta_ (pint) of wine, price eight cents, with Rocjean, he\r\nconcluded to give it another trial. He kept at giving it trials until\r\nthe old Gabioni was closed, and from it arose the Four Nations or\r\nQuattre Nazione in Turkey Cock Alley (_viccolo Gallmaccio_), which, as\r\nany one knows, is near Two Murderers' Street. (_Via Due Macelli_)\r\n\r\n'Now that we have finished dinner,' spoke Rocjean, 'we will smoke: then\r\nto the Caffe or Café Greco and have our cup of black coffee.'\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICA IN ROME.\r\n\r\nIt may be a good thing to have the conceit taken out of us--but not by\r\nthe corkscrew of ignorance; the operation is too painful. Caper, proud\r\nof his country, and believing her in the front rank of nations, was\r\ndestined to learn, while in Rome and the Papal States, that America was\r\ngeographically unknown.\r\n\r\nHe consoled himself for this with the fact that geography is not taught\r\nin the 'Elementary Schools' there;--and for the people there are no\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nThe following translation of a notice advertising for a schoolmaster,\r\ncopied from the walls of a palace where it was posted, shows the sum\r\ntotal taught in the common schools:--\r\n\r\n    The duties of the Master are to teach Reading, Writing, the First\r\n    Four Rules of Arithmetic; to observe the duties prescribed in the\r\n    law '_Quod divina sapientia_;' and to be subject to the biennial\r\n    committee like other salaried officers of the department; as an\r\n    equivalent for which he shall enjoy (_godrá_) an annual salary of\r\n    $60, payable in monthly shares.\r\n\r\n    (Signed)\r\n\r\n    IL GONFALONIERE ---- ----.\r\n\r\nBut what can you expect when one of the rulers of the land asserted to\r\nCaper that he knew that 'pop-corn grew in America on the banks of the\r\nNile, after the water went down,--for it never rains in America'?\r\n\r\nIt was a handsome man, an advocate for Prince Doria, who, once traveling\r\nin a _vetturo_ with Caper, asked him why he did not go to America by\r\nland, since he knew that it was in the south of England; and gently\r\ncorrected a companion of his, who told Caper he had read and thought it\r\nstrange that all Americans lived in holes in the ground, by saying to\r\nhim that if such houses were agreeable to the _Signori Americani_ they\r\nhad every right to inhabit them.\r\n\r\nThe landlord of a hotel in a town about thirty miles from Rome asked\r\nCaper if, when he returned to New York, he would not some morning call\r\nand see his cousin--in Peru!\r\n\r\nThis same landlord once drew his knife on a man, when, accompanied by\r\nCaper, he went to observe a saint's day in a neighboring town. The cause\r\nof the quarrel was this--the landlord, having been asked by a man who\r\nCaper was, told him he was an American. The man asserted that Americans\r\nalways wore long feathers in their hair, and that he did not see any on\r\nCaper's head. The landlord, determined to stand by Caper, swore by all\r\nthe saints that they were under his hat. The man disbelieved it. Out\r\ncame the 'hardware' with that jarring cr-r-r-rick the blade makes when\r\nthe notched knife-back catches in the spring, but Caper jumped between\r\nthem, and they put off stabbing one another--until the next saint's day.\r\n\r\nIt was with pleasure that Caper, passing down the Corso one morning, saw\r\nthere was an Universal Panorama, including views of America, advertised\r\nto be exhibited in the Piazza Colonna. 'Here is an opportunity,' thought\r\nhe, 'for the Romans to acquire some knowledge of a land touching which\r\nthey are very much at sea. The views undoubtedly will do for them what\r\nthe tabooed geographies are not allowed to do--give them a little\r\neducation to slow music.'\r\n\r\nAccompanied by Rocjean, he went one evening to see it, and found it on\r\nwheels in a traveling van, drawn up at one side of the Colonna Square.\r\n\r\n'Hawks inspected it the other evening,' said Rocjean; 'and he describes\r\nit as well worth seeing. The explainer of the Universal Panorama\r\nresembles the wandering Jew, exactly, with perhaps a difference about\r\nthe change in his pockets; and the paintings, comical enough in\r\nthemselves, considering that they are supposed to be serious likenesses\r\nof the places represented, are made still funnier by the explanations of\r\nthe manager.'\r\n\r\nSecuring tickets from a stout, showy ticket-seller, adorned with a\r\nstunning silk dress, crushing bracelets, and an overpowering bonnet,\r\nthey subduedly entered a room twenty feet long by six or eight wide,\r\nilluminated with the mellow glow of what appeared to be about thirty\r\nmoons. The first things that caught their eye were several French\r\nsoldiers who were acting as inspection guard over several rooms, having\r\nstacked their muskets in one corner. Their exclamations of delight or\r\nsorrow, their criticisms of the art panoramic, in short, were full of\r\nhumor and trenchant fun. But 'the explanator' was before them; where he\r\ncame from they could not see, for his footsteps were light as velvet,\r\nevidently having 'gums' on his feet; his milk-white hair, parted in the\r\nmiddle of his forehead, hung down his back for a couple of feet, while\r\nhis milk-white beard, hanging equally low in front, gave him the\r\nappearance of a venerable billy goat. He was an Albino, and his eyes\r\nkept blinking like a white owl's at mid-day. He had a voice slightly\r\ntremulous, and mild as a cat's in a dairy.\r\n\r\n'Gen-till-men, do me the playshure to gaze within this first hole. 'Tis\r\nthe be-yu-ti-fool land of Sweet-sir-land. Vi-yew from the some-mut of\r\nthe Riggy Cool'm. Day break-in' in the dis-tant yeast. He has a blan-kit\r\nround him, sir; for it is cold upon the moun-tin tops at break of day.\r\n[Madame, the stupen-doss irrup-tion of Ve-soov-yus is two holes from the\r\ncorner.]\r\n\r\n'Gen-till-men, do me the play-zure to gaze upon the second hole. 'Tis\r\nFlor-renz the be-yu-ti-fool, be the bangs off the flowin' Arno. 'Twas\r\nhere that--'\r\n\r\n'No matter about all that,' said Caper; 'show off America to us.' He\r\nslipped a couple of _pauls_ into his hand, and instantly the Venerable\r\nskipped four moons.\r\n\r\n'Gen-till-men, do me the play-zure to gaze upon this hole. 'Tis the\r\nbe-yu-ti-fool city of Nuova Jorck in Ay-mer-i-kay, with the\r\nflour-ish-ing cities of Brook-lyn, Nuova Jer-sais, and Long Is-lad. The\r\nimpo-sing struc-ture of rotund form is the Gr-rand Coun-cill Hall\r\ncon-tain-ing the coun-cill chamber of the Amer-i-can nations.... [You\r\nsay it is the Bat-tai-ree? It may be the Bat-tai-ree.] _What is that\r\nroad in Broo-klin_? that is the ra'l-road to Nuova Or-lins di-rect.\r\n_What is that wash-tub_? \"Tis not a wash-tub--'tis a stim-boat. They\r\nmake the stim out of coal, which is found on the ground. _Is that the\r\nAy-mer-i-cain eagill_? 'Tis not; 'tis a hoarse-fly which has\r\nin-tro-doo-ced hisself behind the glass. _Are those savages in Nuova\r\nJer-sais_? (New Jersey.) Those are trees.'\r\n\r\n'Pass on, illustrious gen-till-men, to the next hole. 'Tis the\r\nbe-yu-ti-fool city of Filadelfia. The houses here are all built of\r\nwoo-ood. The two rivaires that cir-cum-vent the city are the Lavar\r\n(Delaware?) and the Hud-soon. I do not know what is \"a pum-king cart,\"\r\nbut the car-riage which you see before you is a fi-ah engine, be-cause\r\nthe city is all built of woo-ood. The tall stee-ple belongs to the\r\nkay-ker (Quaker) temple of San Cristo.'\r\n\r\nRocjean now gave the Venerable a _paul_, requesting him to dwell at\r\nlength upon these scenes, as he was a Frenchman in search of a little of\r\ngeography.\r\n\r\n'Excellencies, I will do my en-dea-vors. The gran-diose ship as lies in\r\nthe Lavar (Delaware) riv-aire is fool of em-i-gr-rants. The signora\r\nde-scen-din' the side of the ship is in a dreadful sit-u-a-tion tru-ly.\r\n[Per-haps the artist was in a boat and de-scri-bed the scene as he saw\r\nit.] The elephant you see de-scen-din' the street is a nay-tive of this\r\ntropi-cal re-gion, and the cock-a-toos infest the sur-round-in' air. The\r\nMoors you see along the wharves are the spon-ta-ne-ous born of the soil.\r\nThose are kay-kers (Quakers?) on mules with broad-brimmed hats onto\r\ntheir heads; the sticks in their hands are to beat the Moors who live on\r\ntheir su-gar plan-tay-tions.... Music? did you ask, Madame? We have none\r\nin this establish-ment. Kone.\r\n\r\n'Excellencies, the next hole. 'Tis the be-yu-ti-fool city of\r\nBal-ti-mory. You behold in the be-fore ground a gr-rand feast day of\r\nAmer-i-cain peas-ants; they are be-hold-ing their noble Count\r\nre-pair-ring to the chase with a serf on a white hoarse-bag\r\n(horse-back?). The little joke of the cattle is a play-fool fan-cy of\r\nthe jocose artiste as did the panorama. I am un-ac-count-able for\r\nveg-garies such as them. The riv-aire in the bag-ground is the\r\nSignora-pippi'....\r\n\r\n'The what?' asked Caper, shaking with laughter.\r\n\r\n'A gen-till-man the other day told me that only the peasants in Americay\r\nsay Missus or Mis-triss, and that the riv-aire con-se-kwen-tilly was not\r\nMissus-pippi, but, as I have had the honor of saying, the Signora-pippi\r\nrivaire. The next hole, Excel-len-cies!--'Tis the be-yu-ti-fool city of\r\nVaskmenton (Washington), also on the Signora-pippi riv-aire. The white\r\nballs on the trees is cot-ton. Those are not white balls on the ground,\r\nthose are ship;--ships as have woolen growin' onto their sides (sheep?).\r\n'Tis not a white bar-racks: 'tis the Palazzo di Vaskmenton, a nobil\r\ngen-e-ral woo lives there, and was for-mer-ly king of the A-mer-i-cain\r\nnations. What does that Moor, with the white lady in his arms? it is a\r\nnegro peas-sant taking his mis-triss out to air,--'tis the customs in\r\nthose land.... That negress or fe-mail Moor with some childs is also\r\nairring, and, the white 'ooman tyin' up her stockings is a sportive of\r\nthe artiste. He is much for the hum-or-ous.\r\n\r\n'Excellencies, the last hole A-mer-i-cain. 'Tis the stoo-pen-doss\r\nSignora-pippi rivaire in all its mag-gnif-fi-cent booty. What is that\r\ncockatoo doing there? He is taking a fly. _You do not see the fly_? I\r\nmean a flight. _What is that bust to flin-ders_? That is a stim-boat was\r\ncarryin' on too much stim, and the stim, which is made of coal, goes,\r\noff like gun-pow-dair if you put lights onto it. This is a fir-ful and\r\nawe-fool sight.

A poetry the\r\npurest, an art the noblest, a religion deeply symbolical, a freedom bold\r\nand magnificent, had given to the world-histories of those early days a\r\nmelody varied and faultless, a form flowing yet well-defined, an\r\nearnestness that was sacred, a truth that was divine. A philosophy rich\r\nand largely suggestive had made the great men of Greece and Rome alert,\r\nvigilant, penetrating, before luxury and oppression had dragged them\r\ndown to ruin and ignorance; and at last Ambition, splendid but\r\ndestructive, becoming the world's artist, blended the midnight tints of\r\ndecline and suffering with the carnation of triumph and liberty, and\r\ncast over the pictures of History the Rembrandt-like shadows, heavy and\r\nwavering, that add a fearful intensity to their charms.\r\n\r\nTo these eras, once splendid and promising, succeeded a night, long,\r\nhopeless, disastrous. Its hours were counted by contentions, its\r\ndarkness was deepened by crime. The sun had set upon a mighty empire,\r\nregnant upon her seven hills, glorious with conquest, drunken with\r\npower: when the day dawned upon the thousandth year of the Christian\r\nera, its crumbled arches and moss-grown walls alone testified to the\r\ntruth of History that had survived the universal destruction.\r\n\r\nAnd now came the age of knight and paladin, of crusades and talismans.\r\nThe rough, vigorous life that had been developing at the North,\r\nexuberant with a strength not yet so mature that it could be employed in\r\nthe wise and practical pursuits of civilized life, burst forth into an\r\nenthusiasm half military, half religious, that pervaded all ranks, but\r\nwas 'mightiest in the mighty.' The Saxons, fair-haired, with wild blue\r\neyes, whence looked an inflexible perseverance, the dark-browed Normans,\r\nand the men of fair Bretagne, swooped down falcon-like from their nests\r\namong the rocks and by the seas of Northern Europe upon the impetuous\r\nSaracens, and fought brave poems that were written on sacred soil with\r\ntheir blood. From the strife of years the heroes returned, their flowing\r\nlocks whitened by years and suffering, the fair Saxon faces browned by\r\nthe fervent suns of the distant East. From hardship and imprisonment\r\nthey marched with gay songs amid acclamations and welcome to their homes\r\nupon the Northern shores. Their once shining armor was dimmed and\r\nrusted with their own blood; but they bore upon their 'spears the light'\r\nof a culture more refined, a knowledge more subtle, than those high\r\nlatitudes had ever before known.\r\n\r\nFrom this marriage of the barbaric vigor of the North with the delicate\r\nand infinitely pliable sensuousness of the South, the classic union of\r\nStrength and Desire, Chivalry was born. Leaping forth to light and\r\npower, a majestic creation, glittering in the knightly panoply, noble by\r\nits knightly vows, it stood resplendent against the dark background of\r\nthe past ages, the inevitable and legitimate offspring of the times and\r\ncircumstances that gave it birth. The courtly baptism was eagerly\r\nsought, its requirements rigidly obeyed. The lands bristled with the\r\nlances of their valiant sons, and Quixotic expeditions were the order of\r\nthe age. But not alone with sword and spear were gallant contests\r\ndecided; the gauntlet thrown at the feet of a proud foe was not always\r\nof iron. _El gai saber_, the _gaye science_, held its august courts,\r\nwhere princesses entered the lists and vanquished gallant troubadours\r\nwith the concord of their sweet measures. Slowly, yet with resistless\r\nstrength, a new social world was rising upon the splendid ruins of the\r\nold. Its principles were just, if their garb was fantastical. It began\r\nwith that almost superstitious reverence for woman, which had borrowed\r\nits religion from the Teuton, its romance from the Minnesinger and the\r\nTrouveur: it will end in the honesty and freedom of a world mature for\r\nits enjoyment.\r\n\r\nThus, while the kingdoms of Europe were rising to a height where to\r\noppress, to torture, to fight, were to seem their sole aim and purpose,\r\nin a hitherto obscure corner of the great theatre of modern life an\r\nunknown element was developing itself, which was in time to shake the\r\ngreatest nations with its power, to inflame all Europe with jealousy and\r\ncupidity, and to dictate to empires the very terms of their existence.\r\nAnd this element was LABOR. The rich lowlands of the 'double-armed'\r\nRhine teemed with a busy life, that, king-like, demanded a tribute of\r\nthe sea, and wrenched from the greedy waves a treasure that its industry\r\nmade priceless. Each man became a prince in his own divine right, and\r\nevery occupation had its lords and its lore, its 'mysteries,' and its\r\nsocial rights. The seamen, merchants, and artisans of the Netherlands\r\nhad made their country the richest in Europe. They ranged the seas and\r\nlearned the value of the land; and while they fed the great despot of\r\nthe Middle Ages, the light of intelligence, born of energy and nurtured\r\nby activity, cast its benignant gleams from the central island of the\r\nRhine, and drove from their mountain nooks the owls and bats of tyranny\r\nand superstition. They fought first, these lords of the soil, among\r\nthemselves, for local privileges, advancing in their continuous\r\nstruggles upon the very threshold of the church. By strong alliances\r\nthey kept at bay their feudal lords, and fettered the ecclesiastical\r\npower with the yoke of a justice, meagre, indeed, and sadly unfruitful,\r\nbut still ominous of a better day. Within the alabaster vase of\r\ndespotism, frail, yet old as ambition, the lamp of freedom had long\r\nburned dimly: now its flames were licking, with serpent-like tongues,\r\nthe enclosure so long deemed sacred, and threatened, as they dyed the\r\nair with their amber flood of light, to shiver their temple to\r\nfragments. The theory of the divine right of kings was but another 'Luck\r\nof Edenhall.' Its slender stem trembled now within the rough grasp of\r\nthe sacrilegious and burly Netherlanders, who hesitated not long ere\r\nthey dashed it with the old superstition to the ground, shaking the\r\ncivilized world to its centre by the shock. But out of the ruins a\r\nstatelier edifice was to rise, whose windows, like those of the old\r\nlegend, were stained by the lifeblood of its architect.\r\n\r\nThe historian who would worthily depict such an age, such a people, such\r\nprinciples, must be an artist, but one in whom the creative faculty does\r\nnot blind the moral obligations. He must bring to the work a republican\r\nsympathy, must be governed by a republican justice, and wear a character\r\nas noble as the struggle that he paints. And such an artist, such a\r\nhistorian, such a man, we have in JOHN LOTHROP MOTLEY.\r\n\r\nThe honors of Harvard, early and nobly earned, had given to the boy at\r\nseventeen the privileges and dignity of manhood. He was destined to\r\nbecome a scholar, eminent, even among the rarely and richly cultured\r\nminds of his own New England, for his universal knowledge, clearness of\r\nintellect, prompt energy, and indomitable perseverance. Inspired by\r\nthese gifts and attainments, it was only natural, almost inevitable,\r\nthat his first appearance upon the literary stage should have been in\r\nthe _rôle_ of a novelist. The active young intellect was pliant and\r\nstrong, but had not yet learned its power. Before him lay the broad\r\nfields of romance, fascinating with their royal _fleurs de lis_, rich\r\nwith the contributions of every age, some quaint and laughter-moving,\r\nsome pompous and exaggerated, some soul-stirring and grand. Impelled,\r\nperhaps, less by a thirst for fame than a desire to satisfy the\r\nresistless impulses of an energetic nature, and lay those fair ghosts of\r\nenterprises dimly recognized that beckoned him onward, he followed the\r\nfirst path that lay before him, and became a romance writer. His first\r\nwork, _Morton's Hope, or the Memoirs of a Provincial_, was published in\r\n1839, and subsequently appeared _Merry Mount, a Romance of\r\nMassachusetts_. It is curious to trace in these first flights of a\r\ngenius that has since learned its legitimate field, a tendency to the\r\nbreadth of Motley's later efforts, an instinctive and evidently\r\nunconscious passion for the descriptive, an admirably curbed yet still\r\npowerful impatience of the light fetters, the toy regulations of the\r\nrealm of Fiction, and an earnestness that has since bloomed in the world\r\nof Fact and History. The very imperfections of the novelist have become\r\nthe charms of the historian. His student-life in Germany, his after-plot\r\nin the stirring Revolutionary times, strongly as they are drawn,\r\nanimated as they are with dashes of that vivid power that stamps every\r\npage of the histories of their author, yet lack the proof of that\r\nunquestioned yet unobtrusive consciousness of genius that harden the\r\ntelling sentences of the _Rise of the Dutch Republic_ and the _United\r\nNetherlands_ into blocks of adamant, polished by friction with each\r\nother to a diamond brightness, and reflecting only the noblest\r\nsentiments, the most profound principles. The dice had been thrown a\r\nsecond time, and Motley had not won a victory. The applause of the press\r\nwas insufficient to the man, who felt that he had not yet struck the\r\nkey-note of his destiny. To be counted the follower of Cooper was not\r\nthe meet guerdon of an intellect to which the shapely monuments of\r\nancient literature yielded the clue to their hieroglyphic labyrinths of\r\nknowledge, and that pierced with lightning swiftness the shell of\r\nevents, and possessed the latent principles of life in their warm\r\nhearts. He returned, therefore, to Europe, leaving behind him a\r\nreputation which at no distant day was destined to spring from a new and\r\nmore noble foundation into a lasting and more stately pile.\r\n\r\nTo a mind like Motley's, the department of history presented the most\r\nattractive features. There could honestly be no dabbling with the\r\nspecious and seductive alchemy of Fiction. Truth had molded every period\r\nof the world's life. Truth defied had tripped up nations in their\r\nheadlong race after dominion and unrighteous power. Truth victorious had\r\nsmiled upon their steady growth to greatness and honor. To write history\r\nwas to write poetry, art, philosophy, religion, life. The pen that\r\nsketched the rise, the progress, and the fate of nations, was in fact\r\nthe chisel of a sculptor, whose theme was humanity.\r\n\r\nAnd what work so fitting for the American author as the record of a\r\nnation struggling away from the oppression of feudal institutions, which\r\nstifled all growth either towards knowledge or civil greatness,\r\nthrowing off the trammels of religious intolerance, defying the most\r\npowerful nation of Christendom, which had breathed an air of bigotry in\r\nits long contest with the Moors, and waging an exhaustive war of nearly\r\na century's duration against fearful odds, only to win an independent\r\nexistence? We had treasured as rare heirlooms the Mechlin laces of our\r\ngrandmothers, had our favorite sets of Tournay porcelain, awaited with\r\ncurious and enthusiastic patience our shares in the floral exportations\r\nof Harlem, trodden daily the carpetings of Brussels, and esteemed\r\nourselves rich with a fragment of its tapestry, or a rifle of Namur; we\r\nhad honored the vast manufacturing interest of the Netherlands, their\r\ncommercial prosperity and noble enterprise; but here all thought of them\r\nhad ended. Schiller had not taught us that the ancestors of the miners\r\nof Mons, the artisans of Brussels, the seamen of Antwerp, the professors\r\nof Leyden, were heroes, worthy to stand beside Leonidas and Bozzaris;\r\nStrâda had failed to rouse us to enthusiasm at the thought of their\r\nlong, noble battle for life. Grotius had indeed painted for us with a\r\nvery Flemish nicety of detail their manners and customs, but had\r\nforgotten to round his skeleton of a nation with the passions that\r\nanimated every stage of its development. It remained for Motley, with\r\nall the quick sympathies of an American heart, to rouse our affections\r\nand to command our reverence for a people so unfortunate and so brave.\r\nIt was reserved for him to teach us that William of Orange was not less\r\na martyr to the truth than Huss or Latimer.\r\n\r\nIt was no common scholar who so worthily finished this task. It was not\r\nenough that the intellectual integrity of oar historian was\r\nunquestioned, his judgment mature, his knowledge vast and comprehensive.\r\nDuring the years of preparation he had become thoroughly cosmopolite;\r\nall the _petty_ prejudices of country and blood had been swept away\r\nbefore the advancing dignity of a reason that became daily more truly\r\nand completely the master of itself. All the thousand minute refinements\r\nof an extensive and intimate association with the commanding and courtly\r\nminds of the age fitted him to cope more successfully with the spirit of\r\nsubtle intrigue, the fox-like sagacity, the wolfish rapacity, the cruel\r\nlack of diplomatic honor, and the illimitable and terrible intolerance\r\nthat distinguished in so wonderful a degree the historical era of\r\nMotley's choice. He came with all the zeal of a true lover of liberty,\r\nhimself republican, as earth's most cultured sons have been in every\r\nage, in thought, habit, and sentiment, to trace for the future and for\r\nus the records of a people who were willing to suffer a master, but who\r\nrevolted from a tyrant; who, with a rare but unappreciated and too nice\r\nhonor, strove to keep to the yoke that their forefathers had worn, only\r\nasking from their ruler the respect and consideration due the faithful\r\nservants of his crown, who were no longer the abject slaves of a\r\nmonarchy, and yet, through an inveterate habit of servitude, were\r\nscarcely prepared for the independence of a republic. How nobly he has\r\nfulfilled his mission, the hearty applause of two nations sufficiently\r\ntestifies.\r\n\r\nTo the wide, comprehensive vision of Motley, history appears in its true\r\nlight as a science, demanding the assistance of other sciences to the\r\ndue and harmonious development of all its parts. It relies not more upon\r\nthe correctness of the recorder's authorities and the profoundness of\r\nhis researches in the mere region of the events and mutual relation of\r\nnations, than upon his universal acquaintance with general literature\r\nand the sister arts of politics and philosophy. It was for the\r\ntreacherous and elegant Bolingbroke to reduce the noble art of\r\nThucydides from the height of sublimity and grandeur to the parlor level\r\nof the conversations of the Hotel de Rambouillet, to introduce into the\r\nmost serious political disquisitions, concerning perhaps the welfare of\r\nsociety, an imperceptible yet carefully elaborated and most effective\r\ntone of levity that speedily proved disastrous to their object. It was\r\nbe who forced the vapid but imposing ceremonial of the _bon ton_ into\r\nthe records of church and state; who clothed his empty but pompous\r\nperiods with the ermine of royalty, to ensure them the reverence of a\r\ndeluded multitude; who stripped Virtue of her ancient prerogatives, and\r\nfed her with the crumbs from his table. His polished diction, undeniable\r\ntalent and fine acquisitions served most unhappily to disguise his real\r\npoverty of sentiment, and for a time, at least, diverted the current of\r\npopular feeling from the true, beautiful, and reliable in early\r\nliterature and art, no less than in history. With what success his\r\nfaulty and imperfect theories were engrafted upon the literature of his\r\nnation, the learned and sagacious Schlosser conclusively proves in his\r\n_History of the Eighteenth Century_. Says this ripe scholar and deep\r\nthinker, 'All that Bolingbroke ridicules as tedious and without talent,\r\nall that he laughs at as useless and without taste, all that which,\r\nurged by his labors and those of his like-minded associates, had for\r\neighty years disappeared from ancient history, is again brought back in\r\nour day. So short is the triumph of falsehood.' Well may we pervert the\r\nverses of Horace,--\r\n\r\n  'Nullæ placere diu, nec vivere _historiæ_ possunt\r\n  Quæ scribuntur aquæ potoribus.'\r\n\r\nThat was an ungenerous fountain whence Bolingbroke drank even his\r\nchilling draughts of inspiration. Splendid, in sooth, as the great\r\n_Brunnen_ of the luckless Abderites of Wieland, with its sea-god of\r\nmarble surrounded by a stately train of nymphs, tritons, and dolphins,\r\nfrom whose jets the water only dripped like tears, because, says the\r\nwriter, with grave naïveté, 'there was scarcely enough to moisten the\r\nlips of a single nymph.' Truly the purple wine of inspiration is as\r\nnecessary to the historian as to the poet; and if the laughing Bacchus\r\nthat holds the beaker to the student's eager lips be not clothed in the\r\nclassic robes of the senate-chamber or the flowing garments of the\r\nprofessor, he wears at least the fawn's dappled hide, and in his hand\r\n\r\n  'His thyrsus holds--an ivy-crowned spear.'\r\n\r\nDoes not the gentle Euripides show us the god, 'his horned head with\r\ndragon wreath entwined?' And those two sacred horns point back to the\r\ndread mysteries of the Ogdoad sublime,\r\n\r\n  'The great Cabiri of earth's dawning prime.'\r\n\r\nThey trace with lines that never swerve from truth the history of the\r\nprimeval world, the early days of Noah and his ark. They recall to us\r\nthe old story of life and suffering, of deluge and salvation; on their\r\ncrescent points hangs the eternal principle of the efficacy of\r\nsacrifice. They float with the moon-ark of Astarté Mylitta on\r\nhyacinthine seas of night-clouds, and their high import, dimmed and lost\r\nin the great stream of Time, rises again in the ages, uncrowned with the\r\nearly luxuriance of symbol and mystery. The mystic horns appear over the\r\nbrow of the queenly Sappho of Grillparzer, upon whose hair\r\n\r\n  'Rested the diadem, _like the pale moon_\r\n  Upon the brow of night, a silver crest;'\r\n\r\nand the white-robed Madonna, with child-like face upraised, and deep,\r\ntender eyes uplifted, yet rests her slender, sandaled foot upon the\r\nhorned moon, floating below her in misty clouds.\r\n\r\nA hiatus for which we crave indulgence; a dream, and yet not all a\r\ndream, for each of these old types encloses a living truth, and unfolds\r\ninto a history, tangled, perhaps, and imperfect, but suggestive and\r\nreliable, of races and religions that had else passed away into\r\noblivion. And the earnest student of the present, or the historian of\r\nthe past, can never disregard these dim old treasures, but must draw\r\nfrom them a fresher faith in his own humanity and in the eternal laws of\r\nGod, that are unchangeable as he is immortal.\r\n\r\nThe art of history advances with the art of poetry; both, and indeed all\r\nliterature, correspond aesthetically with the manners, customs,\r\ntheology, and politics of the nation of their birth. The severe\r\ngrandeur of Thucydides, the invariable sweetness of Xenophon, and the\r\ncheerful elegance of Herodotus, recall, with their just conceptions of\r\nharmony, their noble and sustained flow of thought, and their freedom\r\nfrom the adventitious ornaments of an exaggerated rhetoric or a\r\nsentimental morality, the golden age of Greece. We seem to stand within\r\nthe Parthenon, to gaze upon the Venus of Cnidus, to be jostled by the\r\ngay crowd at the Olympic games. It was indeed a golden age, when all\r\nthat was beautiful in nature was reverently and assiduously nurtured,\r\nand all that was noble and natural in art was magnificently encouraged;\r\nan age in which refinement and nobility were not accidents, but\r\nnecessities; when politics had reached the high grade of an art, and\r\noratory attained a beauty and power beyond which no Pitt, Canning, or\r\nBrougham has ever yet aspired; an age when the gifted Aspasia held her\r\nsplendid court, and Alcibiades and Socrates were proud to sit at the\r\nMilesian's feet; when Pericles, who 'well deserved the lofty title of\r\nOlympian,' lived and ruled: the golden age when Socrates thought and\r\ntaught, bearing in its bosom the guilty day when Socrates died.\r\n\r\nNot less faithful portraitures of the influences that formed them are\r\nthe histories of Livy, of Sallust, and of Tacitus. They wrote in a\r\nlanguage that had been sublimated into electric clouds by the warm and\r\nsplendid diffuseness of Cicero, and reduced to a granite-like strength\r\nby the cold and exquisite simplicity of Terence. The amiable fustian,\r\nthe Falstaffian bombast of Lucan and Ovid's brilliant imagination, all\r\nstamp their indelible seal upon the vivid coloring of Livy, the somewhat\r\naffected severity of Sallust, and the elegant morality of Tacitus. The\r\nbanner of the monarchy flaunts across every page of these writers. They\r\neven bear the impress of an architecture whose splendor and strength did\r\nnot atone for its disregard of the old Hellenic lines and rules. They\r\nbear the same relation to Thucydides and Herodotus that a pillar of the\r\nRoman Ionic order, with its angularly turned volutes and arbitrary\r\nperpendicularity of outline, does to its graceful Greek mother, with her\r\nprimitive and expressive scrolls, and the slightly convex profile of her\r\nshaft. In more modern times, a black-letter, quaint sentence of\r\nFroissart or Monstrelet is like a knight in full armor, bristling with\r\nquaint, beautiful devices, golden dragons inlaid on Milan cuirasses,\r\ngolden vines on broad Venetian blades, apes on the hilts of\r\ngrooved-bladed, firm stilettoes, or the illuminated margins of old\r\nmetrical romances. The pages of Strada are darkened by the stormy\r\npassions of a battling age, crossed with the lurid light of Moorish\r\ntragedies; an _ay de mi Alhama_ moans under his pride and bigotry.\r\nTorquemadas grind each sentence into dullness and inquisitorial\r\nharmlessness, yet now and then sweeps by a trace of Lope de Vega, a word\r\nthat reminds us of Calderon, while still oftener the euphuism of Gongora\r\npervades the writer's mind and flows in platitudes from his guarded pen.\r\n\r\nAs we near our own day, history is invested with new dignities; its arms\r\nfloat, sea-weed like, on the raging waves of political life, as if to\r\ngrasp from some fragment of shipwrecked treaties or some passing argosy\r\nof government a precious jewel to light its deep researches. It takes in\r\nwith nervous grasp the tendencies of literature; its keen gaze drinks in\r\nthe features of popular belief and searches out the fountains of popular\r\nerror. Fully equal to the requirements of the exacting age, Motley has\r\nproduced a work whose lightest merit is its equal conformity to the new\r\nrules of his art. He possesses in an eminent degree the first\r\nqualification which the old Abbé de Mably, in his _Manière d'ecrire\r\nl'histoire_, insists upon for the historian. He recognizes the natural\r\nrights of man, those rights which are the same in every age, and as\r\npowerful in their demands in the sixteenth century as in the nineteenth.\r\nHis well-balanced mind acknowledges and respects the duties of man as\r\ncitizen and magistrate, and the mutual rights of nations. No splendor,\r\nno power, no prejudice, has been able to seduce him from his high\r\nprinciples, neither does a warm and manifest sympathy with his subject\r\ndelude him even into the passing extravagance of an undue praise. If he\r\ncomprehends the greatness of the national character he almost flings\r\nupon the canvas before us, he appreciates as profoundly its weaknesses\r\ntoo. Strada's history is a poison, which strikes at the very roots of\r\nsociety, and would wither all the fresh young leaves of its vigorous\r\nspring. Motley's is its powerful antidote, which restores the juices of\r\nlife to the brittle fibres, smooths out the shriveled leaves, and\r\nclothes them again with the fresh green of hope and promise. Strada is\r\nthe slave of the victor; Motley is the champion of the vanquished.\r\nStrada bends the dignity of Justice before the painted sceptre of\r\nDespotism; Motley exalts the honest title of the man above the will of\r\nthe perjured monarch. Strada gilds with the false gold of sophistry the\r\nvery chains that gall his soul; Motley sharpens on the clear crystal of\r\nhis unobtrusive logic, the two-handed sword of power, and cuts his way\r\nthrough an army of protocols and pacts to the fortress of Liberty.\r\n\r\nIt is, we believe, an exploded theory that the characters of modern\r\ntimes are inferior to those of antiquity. 'Under the toga as under the\r\nmodern dress,' says Guizot, 'in the senate as in our councils, men were\r\nwhat they still are;' and the old Jesuit takes a narrow view of the\r\nprogress of mankind, who asserts that the masculine and vigorous\r\ntreatment that was necessary to Thucydides and Livy is not required by\r\nthe historians of our puny and degenerate day. Even the Count Gobineau,\r\nwho so ably and, to his followers, conclusively proves the fallacy of\r\nthe dearest hope of every learned philanthropist and patriot, does not,\r\nin his most earnest antagonism to the doctrine of human progress,\r\ninsinuate the existence of a principle urging the systematic and\r\ninevitable decline of individual power from age to age. So far from\r\nexacting less of the historian, the present age demands even a firmer\r\nhandling. Our era has its Alexanders and Cæsars; its Hannibals and\r\nHectors; and if these men of antiquity rise before us with an\r\nunapproachable air of grandeur, it is because the light shining from our\r\ndistant stand-point surrounds them with deeper shadows, and throws them\r\nin bolder relief against the background of their vanished ages. It is a\r\nsimple triumph of _chiaro-scuro_, and by no means the proof of the truth\r\nof an absurd theory.\r\n\r\nIt is mournful enough to see the dead nations that were once young and\r\nglorious pacing onward through an inferno like so many headless Bertrand\r\nde Borns, bearing by the hair\r\n\r\n  'The severed member, lantern-wise\r\n  Pendent in hand.'\r\n\r\nFor ourselves, we have no fear of lighting our own spirit thus through\r\nany Malabolge of purification. And this bold faith animates Motley; it\r\ninvigorates all his work with a firmness that inspires full confidence\r\nin his readers. Free as he is from every puerile superstition, his\r\nmastery of his subject is complete. He exercises over it a sort of\r\nmagistracy which extends even to his own flashing impulses. Never\r\npausing to display his moral learning, he avoids the tedious diffuseness\r\nof Rollin; steering adroitly around the quicksands of political\r\ndissertation, he escapes the pragmatical essayism of Guiccardini. Not\r\neasily fascinated by the trifles that swim like vapid foam upon the tide\r\nof history,--petty domestic details, the Königsmark intrigues of\r\nroyalty, the wines and flowers of the banquet table, the laces and\r\njewels of the court,--he leaves far in the distance the entertaining\r\nDavila, who, says the sarcastic Schlosser, 'wrote memoirs after the\r\nFrench fashion for good society,' yet whom the arbitrary and adventurous\r\nBolingbroke does not scruple to declare 'in many respects the equal of\r\nLivy!' And yet no single stroke is omitted which is needed to preserve\r\nthe unity of the work. Tacitus himself did not embellish with more\r\ncommanding morality his histories. The jots and tittles of the _Groot\r\nPrivilegie_, the terms of the famous 'Pacification of Ghent,' the\r\nsolemn import of the _Act of Adjuration_, and the political ambition of\r\nthe church, are as faithfully drawn as the Siege of Leyden, or the\r\n'Spanish Fury' of Antwerp.\r\n\r\nHume, in the narrowness of a so-called philosophical indifference to the\r\nappeals of domestic life and the details of national theology and art,\r\ngives us only a running commentary upon mere chronological events,\r\ngalvanized by the touch of his keen intellect and fine rhetoric into a\r\ndeceitful vigor, and ornamented with the poisonous night-shade blossoms\r\nof a spurious philosophy. We may more justly seek some analogy between\r\nGibbon and Motley, even if the search but discover points of difference\r\nso radical that a comparison is impossible. The solemn, measured, and\r\nsplendid rhetoric of Gibbon is met by the animated, impetuous, and\r\nbrilliant flow of Motley's thought. Neither leans to the ideal; with\r\nboth the actual prevails. The policy of a government is summoned by\r\nneither before the partial tribunal of a sentiment, or the intricate\r\nscheme of some Machiavelli subjected to the imperfect analysis of a\r\nheadstrong imagination. But Gibbon, though he writes in the vernacular,\r\nhas lost all the honest nationality that should give an air of sincerity\r\nto his work; his brilliant antithesis belongs to the ornate school of\r\nthe French literature of the day; and, fascinating as is the pomp and\r\ncommanding march of his sentences, we are rather dazzled by his\r\neloquence than convinced by his argument. He is picturesque, rich; but\r\nit is the picturesqueness and richness of the truly bewildering Roman\r\narchitecture of the Renaissance--half Byzantine, three-eighths Gothic,\r\nand the remainder Greek. But Motley, with all his varied learning and\r\nassociation, is still perfectly and nobly Anglo-Saxon. His short,\r\nepigrammatic sentences ring like the click of musketry before the\r\ncharge, and swell into length and grandeur with the progress of his\r\ntheme. The simplicity, not of ignorance but of genius, characterizes\r\nhim. He does not cater to our hungry fancy, he appeals grandly to our\r\nnoblest impulses. In Motley a spirit of the most refined humanity is\r\neverywhere visible; he is guilty of no Voltairean satiric stabs at\r\npurity, no petulant Voltairean flings at the faith he does not share.\r\nAll is manly, terse, frank, undisguised. Honorable himself, he does not,\r\nlike Gibbon, distrust all mankind, and question with a sarcasm the very\r\nsincerity of a martyr at the stake.\r\n\r\nAmong Americans, Motley is what Botta is to the historians of Southern\r\nEurope. The same grand principles actuate both writers; the same\r\ntendency to philosophical generalization is evident in the structure of\r\ntheir works, the same inflexible pursuit of a fixed and visible aim, the\r\nsame enthusiastic love for freedom. But with Botta the poetical element,\r\nwhich is only secondary with Motley, predominates. He holds the nervous\r\npen of a true Italian--more than that, of a true Italian patriot. All\r\nthe hitherto suppressed fire of his nation flames out on his pages in an\r\nindignation as natural as it is superb. His lines vibrate with passion,\r\nhis words are tremulous with a noble pain. His very pathos is impatient,\r\nstern, and proud; it cleaves our hearts like a battle-axe, rather than\r\nmeets them as with summer showers. His sarcasm is as keen and effective,\r\nbut far more startling; it hisses its way from some iron-cold comment,\r\nand stabs the monarch whom it crowns. His fertility of imagination is\r\nnot weakened by contact with the details of government. The same pen\r\nthat draws in such inimitably graceful lines the sugar-plums of starving\r\nGenoa, lingering about flower-wreathed baskets of bonbons sold in the\r\npublic squares to famishing men and women, sketches in a style as\r\nnervous and appropriate the complex detail of governmental policy. He\r\nunfolds his subject with the skill of an epic poet; its general effect\r\nis sublime, and its petty details arranged with a rarely careless skill.\r\nIf he is sometimes diverted by a burst of enthusiasm, of indignation, or\r\nof horror, into an inequality, the rough island thrown up in the sea of\r\nhis fancy is speedily verdured over with the wonderful luxuriance of his\r\ngenius. If he bends sometimes to amuse, to revel among his sonorous\r\nItalian adjectives in the description of a coronation at Milan, or an\r\nopera of Valetta, it is part of his purpose, giving to his picture the\r\nrich and glowing tints that bring out, by violence of contrast, the more\r\nelaborate tinting in of dark upon dark behind them.\r\n\r\nSomething of this we recognize in Motley; but none of Botta's tendency\r\nto proverbial sayings, bitter with a sarcasm that wounds most deeply its\r\ncreator; as, 'To believe that abstract principle will prevail over full\r\npurses is the folly of a madman.' Neither do we find in Motley the\r\noccasional terse conciseness of Botta,--little epics enclosed in a short\r\nsentence. 'Napoleon had redeemed France; but he had created Italy.' But\r\nthe Italian can not be impartial. Just he is, but it is the accident of\r\nhis political position, not the deference paid by the historian to his\r\nart. He writes of an age from whose injustice he has suffered, of a\r\ncountry whose miseries he has shared, of a people whose brother he is.\r\nAnd here Motley stands second only to Thucydides among historians. In\r\nthe Greek, impartiality was almost divine, for he wrote in the very\r\nsmoke of the conflict, wrote as if with his dripping lance upon rocks\r\ndyed with the blood of his countrymen. With Motley impartiality is the\r\nproduct of a nature strictly noble, that aims through its art not only\r\nto delight the present, but to instruct the future, and which bases its\r\ndoctrines of right and wrong upon the principles that govern universal\r\nnature. The temper of Thucydides is lofty and even; though never genial,\r\nhe is always calm and accessible; though often sublime, he is never\r\npathetic; too grand to be sarcastic, he is also too proud to be selfish.\r\n\r\nMotley, if lacking the great and admirable element of sublimity, which\r\nLonginus extols, compensates for it by the animation and variety of his\r\nstyle, which changes, as does his mood, with his subject. He enters with\r\nall the vigor of his manhood into the spirit of the scenes which he\r\nsketches. He describes a character, and his strokes are bold, quick,\r\ndecided; he follows the intricacies of political intrigue, and his\r\nmovement is slow, continuous, wary, while it still remains firm,\r\nconfident, and successful. He can administer the finances with Escovedo,\r\nwhile his wide, keen intelligence, undismayed, masters at a glance the\r\nwily policy of Alexander of the '_fel Gesicht_.' No modern historian has\r\ngiven more comprehensive sketches of character. No quality escapes his\r\nvigilance; he yields every faculty the consideration which is its due.\r\nThe portraits of Alva, of Navarre, of Farnese, of Orange, of Don John of\r\nAustria, are so many colossal statues, that seem to unite in themselves\r\nall the possible features and characteristics of humanity. He is indeed\r\nrather a sculptor than a painter. His figures are round, perfect,\r\nthrobbing with life, and their hard and striking outlines, springing\r\nsharply from the background of despotism and persecution, are more\r\nimposing than any Rubens-like vividness of coloring which could warm\r\nthem. He treats of diplomacy as a diplomat, unwinds the reel of protocol\r\nand treaty, and binds up with the inflexible cord the rich sheaves of\r\nhis deep researches. His reflections are suggestive but short, and his\r\ndetails never weary.\r\n\r\nHe loves, too, to mark the sympathies of nature with event--the rain\r\nfalling upon the black-hung scaffold, or the laughter of gay sunshine\r\nmingling with the shouts of a great victory. And here he differs, as\r\nindeed he does in almost every other respect, with Macaulay. The\r\nEnglishman thinks little of nature; as he himself says of Dante, 'He\r\nleaves to others the earth, the ocean, and the sky; his business is with\r\nman.' Indeed, the absence of a true and universal sympathy is the one\r\nvast defect of Macaulay. No position is so high that it may not be\r\novershadowed by the giant form of his violent partisanship, no character\r\nso small that it may not be raised to the semblance of greatness by the\r\nmere force of his political preferences. His scholarship was splendid,\r\nhis genius commanding, the beauty of his style unsurpassed; but he\r\nperverted his knowledge to subserve certain public ends, and wielded his\r\nmagnificent powers too often in the defence of an undeserving cause.\r\nFascinated by his dazzling rhetoric, borne along by its rapid and\r\ntumultuous current to the most brilliant conclusions, we forget the\r\nnarrowness of the stream. His scope of vision was indeed great, but it\r\nhad its limits, and these were not imposed by time or necessity, but by\r\nthe unyielding will of his own prejudices. As his virtues were massive,\r\nso were his errors grievous. He ventured to grasp the great speculative\r\nthemes of existence with a mind that was neither profound nor\r\nsuggestive. He swam with all the wondrous ease of an athlete through the\r\nbillows and across the currents and counter-currents of elegant\r\nliterature, of politics, of theology, yet possessed not the diver's\r\npower to win their sunken but priceless jewels. Rich he was with the\r\naccumulated intellectual spoil of centuries, but the power of exhaustive\r\ngeneralization was denied him. His perceptions were vigorous and acute,\r\nand none knew more perfectly to exhaust a subject, if its requirements\r\nwere of the actual and tangible rather than of the ideal and spiritual\r\norder. He was a thorough logician, but a superficial philosopher; a\r\nmaster of style, but oblivious of those great religious truths of which\r\nthe events of his great history were but the natural outgrowth and\r\nproduct. But nothing can exceed the power of his rhetoric, that is\r\nuncontrolled by any laws, yet offends none, unless it be the\r\narbitrariness of his dogmatism, that concedes no favors and asks no\r\ngifts.\r\n\r\nLess vehement, less ornate, possibly less learned than Macaulay, with\r\nfrequent though trifling inequalities of style, Motley goes far beyond\r\nhim in real practical insight into the heart of affairs. There is a\r\nunity in all visible life, whether of nation, of individual, of church,\r\nor of inarticulate nature, that escaped Macaulay and impresses Motley.\r\nThe one would govern the universe with the arbitrary rules of a\r\npolitical clique; the other applies to all the infallible test of a\r\nuniversal philosophy. Both writers are thoroughly incorporated with\r\ntheir subject; but where Macaulay was the captive of a mighty and often\r\njust prejudice, Motley is the exponent of a living principle. Everywhere\r\nMacaulay was a Whig and an Englishman; everywhere Motley is a Republican\r\nand a cosmopolite.\r\n\r\nMotley is indeed inferior to his English contemporary in many striking\r\npoints whose value every reader will determine for himself; but his\r\noccasional and rare inaccuracies of expression and inelegances of\r\nlanguage are on the surface, and may be removed by the stroke of a pen\r\nwithout marring the general effect of his work. He possesses, among many\r\ncharms, an unfailing geniality, which, united with his fine dramatic\r\npowers, fascinates us completely. He abounds also in fine poetical\r\ntouches, that give us glimpses of a mind cultured to the last degree of\r\nliterary refinement. His 'rows of whispering limes and poplars' are like\r\narabesques of gold straying over the margins of some old _romanceros_.\r\nHis descriptions glow with the fresh and ever-varying delight of the\r\nobservant traveler, who seems to see before him for the first time the\r\ncities which, with a few vigorous and simple strokes, he transfers to\r\nbig pages. His pictures have the charm of naturalness and a simplicity\r\nthat is more effective than the most ornate diffuseness. Thus he says of\r\nthe picturesque little city of Namur: 'Seated at the confluence of the\r\nSambre with the Meuse, and throwing over each river a bridge of solid\r\nbut graceful structure, it lay in the lap of a most fruitful valley. A\r\nbroad, crescent-shaped plain, fringed by the rapid Meuse, and enclosed\r\nby gently-rolling hills, cultivated to their crests, or by abrupt\r\nprecipices of limestone crowned with verdure, was divided by numerous\r\nhedgerows, and dotted all over with corn-fields, vine-yards, and\r\nflower-gardens. Many eyes have gazed with delight upon that well-known\r\nand most lovely valley, and many torrents of blood have mingled with\r\nthose glancing waters since that long-buried and most sanguinary age\r\nwhich forms our theme; and still, placid as ever is the valley, brightly\r\nas ever flows the stream. Even now, as in that banished but\r\nnever-forgotten time, nestles the little city in the angle of the two\r\nrivers; still directly over its head seems to hang in mid-air the\r\nmassive and frowning fortress, like the gigantic helmet in the fiction,\r\nas if ready to crush the pigmy town below.' How like the _Ueberfahrt_ of\r\nUhland:--\r\n\r\n  'Ueber diesen Strohm, vor Jahren,\r\n  Bin ich einmal schon gefahren,\r\n  Hier die Burg, im Abendschimmer,\r\n  Drüben rauscht das Wehr, wie immer.'\r\n\r\nWe may quote his description of the great square of Brussels, the scene\r\nof the double execution of Montmorency, of Horn, and the gallant and\r\nunfortunate 'Count d'Egmont,' not only as an example of his dignified\r\nand sustained style, but also as an evidence of his sensitiveness to\r\nthose minor refinements of association and place that bespeaks the\r\ntalented artist. 'The great square of Brussels had always a striking and\r\ntheatrical aspect. Its architectural effects, suggesting in some degree\r\nthe meretricious union between Oriental and a corrupt Grecian art,\r\naccomplished in the mediaeval midnight, have amazed the eyes of many\r\ngenerations. The splendid Hotel de Ville, with its daring spire and\r\nelaborate front, ornamented one side of the place; directly opposite was\r\nthe graceful but incoherent façade of the Brood-huis, now the last\r\nearthly resting place of the two distinguished victims; while grouped\r\naround these principal buildings rose the fantastic palaces of the\r\nArchers, Mariners, and other guilds, with their festooned walls and\r\ntoppling gables bedizened profusely with emblems, statues, and quaint\r\ndecorations. The place had been alike the scene of many a brilliant\r\ntournament and of many a bloody execution. Gallant knights had contended\r\nwithin its precincts, while bright eyes rained influences from all those\r\npicturesque balconies and decorated windows. Martyrs to religious and to\r\npolitical liberty had upon the same spot endured agonies which might\r\nhave roused every stone of its pavement to mutiny or softened them to\r\npity. Here Egmont himself, in happier days, had often borne away the\r\nprize of skill or of valor, the cynosure of every eye; and hence, almost\r\nin the noon of a life illustrated by many brilliant actions, he was to\r\nbe sent, by the hand of tyranny, to his great account.'\r\n\r\nThere are, too, dashes of a healthy sarcasm among these records, not,\r\nhowever, of such frequent occurrence as to darken the flow of the\r\nnarrative, but sufficiently indicative of the strength and energy of the\r\nwriter. Never attacking the honest faith of any man, his satires are\r\nlevelled at hypocrisy, never error, as when he says of the venerable\r\ntyrant, the master of the Invincible Armada, when he had received from\r\nthe trembling secretary the assurance of the failure of the hope of\r\nSpain: 'So the king, as fortune flew away from him, wrapped himself in\r\nhis virtue, and his counsellors, imitating their sovereign, arrayed\r\nthemselves in the same garment;' a scanty mantle, in truth, but, no\r\ndoubt, amply sufficient for the denizens of that torrid atmosphere of\r\nbigotry in which Spain has lived for centuries.\r\n\r\nOf what earnest stuff Motley's dreams of religious freedom are made, we\r\nread in his terse comments upon the declaration of the principles of\r\nliberty of conscience by the States General. 'Such words shine through\r\nthe prevailing darkness of the religious atmosphere at that epoch like\r\ncharacters of light. They are beacons in the upward path of mankind.\r\nNever before had so bold and wise a tribute to the genius of the\r\nReformation been paid by an organized community. Individuals walking in\r\nadvance of their age had enunciated such truths, and their voices had\r\nseemed to die away, but at last, a little, struggling, half-developed\r\ncommonwealth had proclaimed the rights of conscience for all mankind.'\r\n\r\nThus we have no longer a wearisome compilation of events strung upon the\r\nthread of chronology, but a practical history of the most momentous\r\nepoch of modern times. No hand has before pointed out so faithfully its\r\ngreat motive power or adjusted so nicely its apparent contradictions.\r\nThe structure is grand; it is the expression of a glorious faith. In the\r\naccomplishment of so vast a design, Motley has won our warmest\r\ngratitude, while he has awakened our deepest sympathies. Not alone to\r\nthe learned, the scholarly, and the elegant, are these volumes\r\naddressed; their high-toned thought has met response in the people's\r\nheart, and children bend with flushed faces over the high romance of the\r\nstruggle that cost the lives of thousands, and recognize, perhaps dimly,\r\nthe import of that great advance from the darkness of intolerance to the\r\nlight of freedom, that was so well worth the treasure of blood with\r\nwhich it was bought.\r\n\r\nAnd here we part with Motley the historian, only to clasp hands with\r\nMotley the patriot. In the present tremendous struggle of people against\r\nprogress, this fierce contest between labor and the lords, these last\r\nconvulsions of the expiring giant of feudal aristocracy, whose monstrous\r\nconception dates far back among the Middle Ages, Motley has shown\r\nhimself the true champion of the doctrines advocated in his histories.\r\nHis platform is still the same, but how changed the theatre of his\r\naction! His letter to the London _Times_ on the 'Causes of the American\r\nCivil War' is a masterly exposition of facts, whose naked power is\r\nobscured by no useless displays of rhetoric. Its tone is calm,\r\ndignified, confident; its statements are strongly maintained, its logic\r\nconvincing. All honor to the man who from his quiet researches in royal\r\narchives and busy deciphering of dusty MSS. turned to his country in her\r\nhour of need, and defended her where defence should have been\r\nsuperfluous, but was, unhappily, of small avail. And still he works\r\nnobly for the dear old flag, and, intimately _lié_ as he is with the\r\nfirst literati and politicians of Europe, it is not easy to measure his\r\ninfluence. His purely literary habits forbid all suspicion of his\r\ndisinterestedness, and will go far to commend him to the sympathies of\r\nthe commanding intellects of the age. Let us hope for the time when,\r\nwith renewed faith in his mighty theories and still renewing love for\r\nhis motherland, he shall return to the retirement which has already\r\nproduced such noble fruits, and add works as worthy to our American\r\nclassics. Meanwhile, _vive qui vince!_\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE LESSON OF THE HOUR.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Thou who for years hast watched the course of nature,\r\n    What time the changing seasons swept their round,\r\n  And, 'mid the play of every varying feature,\r\n    New founts of pleasure for thyself hast found;\r\n  Who, when dark clouds upon the mountain glooming,\r\n    Threaten destruction to the smiling plain,\r\n  Canst pierce the shadow and foresee the blooming\r\n    Of budding blossoms brighter for the rain:\r\n\r\n  To whom, when the dread winter's icy fingers\r\n    Have chilled to silence the gay babbling stream,\r\n  A memory of its summer music lingers,\r\n    Or April violets in the future beam;\r\n  To whom the darkness whispers of the dawning,\r\n    And sorrow's night tells of the coming day;\r\n  And even death is but the twilight morning\r\n    Of glory which shall never fade away;--\r\n\r\n  _Teach us thy lesson_. Unto us be given\r\n    The trusting faith the April flowers display;\r\n  Looking in their meek confidence to heaven,--\r\n    Trusting to God the future of the day.\r\n  Our night is dark, and perils vast surround us,\r\n    But, firm in truth and right, what shall we fear?\r\n  Has danger ever yet base cravens found us?\r\n    Who has sustained thus far will guide us here.\r\n\r\n  Ye countless legions, where each man is holding\r\n    Himself a bulwark for the cause of right,\r\n  In war's fierce furnace, where our God is molding\r\n    Each soul for his own ends in Freedom's fight,\r\n  March on to victory in overwhelming number,\r\n    Singing the peans of the noble free;\r\n  Our Liberty has just awaked from slumber,\r\n    To carry out the world's great destiny.\r\n\r\n  O mighty nation! all thy early glory\r\n    Shall be as nothing to the great renown\r\n  Which in the future ages shall come o'er thee,\r\n    For thine is Liberty's immortal crown.\r\n  Heed not the jealousies forever thronging,--\r\n    The petty envyings which gird thee round;\r\n  'Tis thine to carry out the world's great longing,\r\n    To find that liberty none else has found.\r\n\r\n  What though across the swelling, broad Atlantic\r\n    Comes scornful menace? it is naught to thee--\r\n  'Tis but the jealous raving, wild and frantic,\r\n    Of those who would, but never can, be free;--\r\n  Who, slaves to selfish passions bold ambition,\r\n    Hold up their shackled arms in heaven's broad light,\r\n  And prate of freedom, boast their high position,\r\n    And strive to turn to interest Truth and Right.\r\n\r\n  _We need more faith!_ What though the means be weakness?\r\n    With God supreme, the victory must be ours!\r\n  From imperfection he works out completeness;\r\n    From feeble means makes overwhelming powers.\r\n  How shall this be?

You'se safe _har_,' rejoined the old woman,\r\ndropping her aged limbs into a chair, and rocking away with much the\r\nsame air which ancient white ladies occasionally assume.\r\n\r\n'Won't you ax Massa K---- to a cheer?' said Scip; 'he hab ben bery kine\r\nto me.'\r\n\r\nThe negress then offered me a seat; but it was some minutes before I\r\nrendered myself sufficiently agreeable to thaw out the icy dignity of\r\nher manner. Meanwhile I glanced around the apartment.\r\n\r\nThough the exterior of the cabin was like the others on the plantation,\r\nthe interior had a rude, grotesque elegance about it far in advance of\r\nany negro hut I had ever seen. The logs were chinked with clay, and the\r\none window, though destitute of glass, and ornamented with the\r\ninevitable board-shutter, had a green moreen curtain, which kept out the\r\nwind and the rain. A worn but neat and well-swept carpet partly covered\r\nthe floor, and on the low bed was spread a patch-work counterpane.\r\nAgainst the side of the room opposite the door stood an antique,\r\nbrass-handled bureau, and an old-fashioned table, covered with a faded\r\nwoolen cloth, occupied the centre of the apartment. In the corner near\r\nthe fire was a curiously-contrived side-board, made of narrow strips of\r\nyellow pine, tongued and grooved together, and oiled so as to bring out\r\nthe beautiful grain of the wood. On it were several broken and cracked\r\nglasses, and an array of irregular crockery. The rocking-chair, in which\r\nthe old negress passed the most of her time, was of mahogany, wadded and\r\ncovered with chintz, and the arm-seat I occupied, though old and patched\r\nin many places, had evidently moved in good society.\r\n\r\nThe mistress of this second-hand furniture establishment was arrayed in\r\na mass of cast-off finery, whose gay colors were in striking contrast\r\nwith her jet-black skin and bent, decrepit form. Her gown, which was\r\nvery short, was of flaming red and yellow worsted stuff, and the\r\nenormous turban that graced her head and hid all but a few tufts of her\r\nfrizzled, 'pepper-and-salt' locks, was evidently a contribution from the\r\nfamily stock of worn-out pillow-cases. She was very aged,--upwards of\r\nseventy,--and so thin that, had she not been endowed with speech and\r\nmotion, she might have passed for a bundle of whalebone thrown into\r\nhuman shape, and covered with a coating of gutta-percha. It was evident\r\nshe had been a valued house-servant, whose few remaining years were\r\nbeing soothed and solaced by the kind and indulgent care of a grateful\r\nmaster.\r\n\r\nScip, I soon saw, was a favorite with the old-negress, and the marked\r\nrespect he showed me quickly dispelled the angry feeling excited by my\r\ndoubts of 'Massa Davy,' and opened her heart and her mouth at the same\r\nmoment. She was terribly garrulous; her tongue, as soon as it got under\r\nway, ran on as if propelled by machinery and acquainted with the secret\r\nof perpetual motion; but she was an interesting study. The\r\nsingle-hearted attachment she showed for her master and his family gave\r\nme a new insight into the practical working of 'the peculiar\r\ninstitution,' and convinced me that even slavery, in some of its\r\naspects, is not so black as it is painted.\r\n\r\nWhen we were seated, I said to Scip, 'What induced you to lay hands on\r\nthe Colonel? It is death, you know, if he enforces the law.'\r\n\r\n'I knows dat, massa; I knows dat; but I had to do it. Dat Moye am de ole\r\ndebil, but de folks round har wud hab turned on de Cunnel, shore, ef\r\nhe'd killed him. Dey don't like de Cunnel; dey say he'm a stuck-up\r\nseshener.'\r\n\r\n'The Colonel, then, has befriended you at some time?'\r\n\r\n'No, no, sar; 'twarn't dat; dough I'se know'd him a long w'ile,--eber\r\nsense my ole massa fotched me from de Habana,--but 'twarn't dat.'\r\n\r\n'Then _why_ did you do it?'\r\n\r\nThe black hesitated a moment, and glanced at the old negress, then\r\nsaid,--\r\n\r\n'You see, massa, w'en I fuss come to Charles'n, a pore little ting, wid\r\nno friend in all de worle, dis ole aunty war a mudder to me. She nussed\r\nde Cunnel; he am jess like her own chile, and I know'd 'twud kill her ef\r\nhe got hisself enter trubble.'\r\n\r\nI noticed certain convulsive twitchings about the corners of the old\r\nwoman's mouth as she rose from her seat, threw her arms around Scip,\r\nand, in words broken by sobs, faltered out,--\r\n\r\n'_You_ am my chile; I loves you better dan Massa Davy--better dan all de\r\nworle.'\r\n\r\nThe scene, had they not been black, would have been one for a painter.\r\n\r\n'You were the Colonel's nurse, Aunty,' I said, when she had regained her\r\ncomposure. 'Have you always lived with him?'\r\n\r\n'Yas, sar, allers; I nussed him, and den de chil'ren--all ob 'em.'\r\n\r\n'All the children? I thought the Colonel had but one--Miss Clara.'\r\n\r\n'Wal, he habn't, massa, only de boys.'\r\n\r\n'What boys? I never heard he had sons.'\r\n\r\n'Neber heerd of young Massa Davy, nor Massa Tommy! Hain't you _seed_\r\nMassa Tommy, sar?'\r\n\r\n'Tommy! I was told he was Madam P----'s son.'\r\n\r\n'So he am; Massa Davy had _her_ long afore he had missus.'\r\n\r\nThe truth flashed upon me; but could it be possible? Was I in South\r\nCarolina or in Utah?\r\n\r\n'Who is Madam P----?' I asked.\r\n\r\nThe old woman hesitated a moment, as if in doubt whether she had not\r\nsaid too much; but Scip quietly replied,--\r\n\r\n'She'm jess what aunty am--_de Cunnel's slave!_'\r\n\r\n'His _slave_! it can't be possible; she is white!'\r\n\r\n'No, massa; she am brack, and de Cunnel's slave!'\r\n\r\nNot to weary the reader with a long repetition of negro-English, I will\r\ntell in brief what I gleaned from an hour's conversation with the two\r\nblacks.\r\n\r\nMadam P---- was the daughter of Ex-Gov. ----, of Virginia, by a\r\nquarteron woman. She was born a slave, but was acknowledged as her\r\nfather's child, and reared in his family with his legitimate children.\r\nWhen she was ten years of age her father died, and his estate proving\r\ninsolvent, the land and negroes were brought under the hammer. His\r\ndaughter, never having been manumitted, was inventoried and sold with\r\nthe other property. The Colonel, then just of age, and a young man of\r\nfortune, bought her and took her to the residence of his mother in\r\nCharleston. A governess was provided for her, and a year or two\r\nafterwards she was taken to the North to be educated. There she was\r\nfrequently visited by the Colonel; and when fifteen her condition became\r\nsuch that she was obliged to return home. He conveyed her to the\r\nplantation, where her elder son, David, was soon afterwards born, 'Aunt\r\nLucy' officiating on the occasion. When the child was two years old,\r\nleaving it in charge of the aged negress, she accompanied the Colonel to\r\nEurope, where they remained for a year. Subsequently she passed another\r\nyear at a Northern seminary; and then, returning to the plantation, was\r\nduly installed as its mistress, and had ever since presided over its\r\ndomestic affairs. She was kind and good to the negroes, who were greatly\r\nattached to her, and much of the Colonel's wealth was due to her\r\nexcellent management of the estate.\r\n\r\nSix years after the birth of 'young Massa Davy,' the Colonel married his\r\npresent wife, that lady having full knowledge of his left-handed\r\nconnection with Madam P----, and consenting that the 'bond-woman' should\r\nremain on the plantation, as its mistress. The legitimate wife resided,\r\nduring most of the year, in Charleston, and when at the homestead took\r\nlittle interest in domestic matters. On one of her visits to the\r\nplantation, twelve years before, her daughter, Miss Clara, was born, and\r\nwithin a week, and under the same roof, Madam P---- presented the\r\nColonel with a son,--the lad Thomas, of whom I have spoken. As the\r\nmother was a slave, the children were so also at their birth, but _they_\r\nhad been manumitted by their father. One of them was being educated in\r\nGermany; and it was intended that both should spend their lives in that\r\ncountry, the taint in their blood being an insuperable bar to their ever\r\nacquiring social position at the South.\r\n\r\nAs she finished the story, the old woman said, 'Massa Davy am bery kind\r\nto de missus, sar, but he _love_ de ma'am; an' he can't help it, 'cause\r\nshe'm jess so good as de angels.'[K]\r\n\r\nI looked at my watch,--it was nearly ten o'clock, and I rose to go. As I\r\ndid so the old negress said,--\r\n\r\n'Don't yer gwo, massa, 'fore you hab sum ob aunty's wine; you'm good\r\nfriends wid Scip, and I knows _you'se_ not too proud to drink wid brack\r\nfolks, ef you am from de Norf.'\r\n\r\nBeing curious to know what quality of wine a plantation slave indulged\r\nin, I accepted the invitation. She went to the side-board, and brought\r\nout a cut-glass decanter, and three cracked tumblers, which she placed\r\non the table. Filling the glasses to the brim, she passed one to Scip,\r\nand one to me, and, with the other in her hand, resumed her seat.\r\nWishing her a good many happy years, and Scip a pleasant journey home, I\r\nemptied the glass. It was Scuppernong, and the pure juice of the grape!\r\n\r\n'Aunty,' I said, 'this wine is as fine as I ever tasted.'\r\n\r\n'Oh yas, massa, it am de raal stuff. I growed de grapes myseff.'\r\n\r\n'You grew them?'\r\n\r\n'Yas, sar, an' Massa Davy make de wine. He do it ebery yar for de ole\r\nnuss.'\r\n\r\n'The Colonel is very good. Do you raise anything else?'\r\n\r\n'Yas, I hab collards and taters, a little corn, and most ebery ting.'\r\n\r\n'But who does your work? _You_ certainly can't do it?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, de ma'am looks arter dat, sar; she'm bery good to de ole aunty.'\r\n\r\nShaking hands with both the negroes, I left the cabin, fully convinced\r\nthat all the happiness in this world is not found within plastered\r\napartments.\r\n\r\nThe door of the mansion was bolted and barred; but, rapping for\r\nadmission, I soon heard the Colonel's voice asking, 'Who is there?'\r\nGiving a satisfactory answer, I was admitted. Explaining that he\r\nsupposed I had retired to my room, he led the way to the library.\r\n\r\nThat apartment was much more elegantly furnished than the drawing-rooms.\r\nThree of its sides were lined with books, and on the centre-table,\r\npapers, pamphlets, and manuscripts were scattered in promiscuous\r\nconfusion. In an armchair near the fire, Madam P---- was seated,\r\nreading. The Colonel's manner was as composed as if nothing had\r\ndisturbed the usual routine of the plantation; no trace of the recent\r\nterrible excitement was visible; in fact, had I not been a witness to\r\nthe late tragedy, I should have thought it incredible that he, within\r\ntwo hours, had been an actor in a scene which had cost a human being his\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n'Where in creation have you been, my dear fellow?' he asked, as we took\r\nour seats.\r\n\r\n'At old Lucy's cabin, with Scip,' I replied.\r\n\r\n'Indeed. I supposed the darky had gone.'\r\n\r\n'No, he doesn't go till the morning.'\r\n\r\n'I told you he wouldn't, David,' said Madam P----; 'now, send for\r\nhim,--do make friends with him before he goes.'\r\n\r\n'No, Alice, it won't do. I bear him no ill-will, but it won't do. It\r\nwould be all over the plantation in an hour.'\r\n\r\n'No matter for that; our people would like you the better for it.'\r\n\r\n'No, no. I can't do it. I mean him no harm, but I can't do that.'\r\n\r\n'He told me _why_ he interfered between you and Moye,' I remarked.\r\n\r\n'Why did he?'\r\n\r\n'He says old Lucy, years ago, was a mother to him; that she is greatly\r\nattached to you, and it would kill her if any harm happened to you; and\r\nthat your neighbors bear you no good-will, and would have enforced the\r\nlaw had you killed Moye.'\r\n\r\n'It is true, David; you would have had to answer for it.'\r\n\r\n'Nonsense! what influence could this North County scum have against\r\n_me_?'\r\n\r\n'Perhaps none. But that makes no difference; Scipio did right, and you\r\nshould tell him you forgive him.'\r\n\r\nThe Colonel then rang a small bell, and a negro woman soon appeared.\r\n'Sue,' he said, 'go to Aunt Lucy's and ask Scip to come here. Bring him\r\nin at the front door, and, mind, let no one know he comes.'\r\n\r\nThe woman in a short time returned with Scip. There was not a trace of\r\nfear or embarrassment in the negro's manner as he entered the room.\r\nMaking a respectful bow, he bade us 'good evening.'\r\n\r\n'Good evening, Scip,' said the Colonel, rising and giving the black his\r\nhand; 'let us be friends. Madam tells me I should forgive you, and I\r\ndo.'\r\n\r\n'Aunt Lucy say ma'am am an angel, sar, and it am tru,--it am tru, sar,'\r\nreplied the negro, with considerable feeling.\r\n\r\nThe lady rose, also, and took Scip's hand, saying, '_I_ not only forgive\r\nyou, Scipio, but I _thank_ you for what you have done. I shall never\r\nforget it.'\r\n\r\n'You'se too good, ma'am; you'se too good to say dat,' replied the darky,\r\nthe moisture coming to his eyes; 'but I meant nuffin' wrong,--I meant\r\nnuffin' dis'specful to de Cunnel.'\r\n\r\n'I know you didn't, Scip; but we'll say no more about it;--good-by,'\r\nsaid the Colonel.\r\n\r\nShaking hands with each one of us, the darky left the apartment.\r\n\r\nOne who does not know that the high-bred Southern gentleman considers\r\nthe black as far below him as the horse he drives, or the dog he kicks,\r\ncan not realize the amazing sacrifice of pride which the Colonel made in\r\nseeking a reconciliation with Scip. It was the cutting off of his right\r\nhand. The circumstance showed the powerful influence held over him by\r\nthe octoroon woman. Strange that she, his slave, cast out from society\r\nby her blood and her life, despised, no doubt, by all the world, save by\r\nhim and a few ignorant blacks, should thus control a proud, self-willed,\r\npassionate man, and control him, too, only for good.\r\n\r\nAfter the black had gone, I said to the Colonel, 'I was much interested\r\nin old Lucy. A few more such instances of cheerful and contented old\r\nage might lead me to think better of slavery.'\r\n\r\n'Such cases are not rare, sir. They show the paternal character of our\r\n\"institution.\" We are _forced_ to care for our servants in their old\r\nage.'\r\n\r\n'But have your other aged slaves the same comforts that Aunt Lucy has?'\r\n\r\n'No; they don't need them. She has been accustomed to live in my house,\r\nand to fare better than the plantation hands; she therefore requires\r\nbetter treatment.'\r\n\r\n'Is not the support of that class a heavy tax upon you?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, it _is_ heavy. We have, of course, to deduct it from the labor of\r\nthe able-bodied hands.'\r\n\r\n'What is the usual proportion of sick and infirm on your plantation?'\r\n\r\n'Counting in the child-bearing women, I reckon about twenty per cent.'\r\n\r\n'And what does it cost you to support each hand?'\r\n\r\n'Well, it costs _me_, for children and all, about seventy-five dollars a\r\nyear. In some places it costs less. _I_ have to buy all my provisions.'\r\n\r\n'What proportion of your slaves are able-bodied hands?'\r\n\r\n'Somewhere about sixty per cent. I have, all told, old and young,--men,\r\nwomen, and children,--two hundred and seventy. Out of that number I have\r\nnow equal to a hundred and fifty-four _full_ hands. You understand that\r\nwe classify them: some do only half tasks, some three-quarters. I have\r\n_more_ than a hundred and fifty-four working men and women, but they do\r\nonly that number of full tasks.'\r\n\r\n'What does the labor of a _full_ hand yield?'\r\n\r\n'At the present price of turpentine, my calculation is about two hundred\r\ndollars a year.'\r\n\r\n'Then your crop brings you about thirty-one thousand dollars, and the\r\nsupport of your negroes costs you twenty thousand.'\r\n\r\n'Yes.'\r\n\r\n'If that's the case, my friend, let me advise you to sell your\r\nplantation, free your niggers, and go North.'\r\n\r\n'Why so, my dear fellow?' asked the Colonel, laughing.\r\n\r\n'Because you'd make money by the operation.'\r\n\r\n'I never was good at arithmetic; go into the figures,' he replied, still\r\nlaughing, while Madam P----, who had laid aside her book, listened very\r\nattentively.\r\n\r\n'Well, you have two hundred and seventy negroes, whom you value, we'll\r\nsay, with your mules, \"stills,\" and movable property, at two hundred\r\nthousand dollars; and twenty thousand acres of land, worth about three\r\ndollars and a half an acre; all told, two hundred and seventy thousand\r\ndollars. A hundred and fifty-four able-bodied hands produce you a yearly\r\nprofit of eleven thousand dollars, which, saying nothing about the cost\r\nof keeping your live stock, the wear and tear of your mules and\r\nmachinery, and the yearly loss of your slaves by death, is only four per\r\ncent. on your capital. Now, with only the price of your land, say\r\nseventy thousand dollars, invested in safe stocks at the North, you\r\ncould realize eight per cent.--five thousand six hundred dollars,--and\r\nlive at your ease; and that, I judge, if you have many runaways, or many\r\ndie on your hands, is as much as you really _clear_ now. Besides, if you\r\nshould invest seventy thousand dollars in almost any legitimate business\r\nat the North, and should add to it, _as you now do_, your _time_ and\r\n_labor_, you would realize far more than you do at present from your\r\nentire capital.'\r\n\r\n'I never looked at the matter in that light. But I have given you my\r\nprofits as they _now_ are; some years I make more; six years ago I made\r\ntwenty-five thousand dollars.'\r\n\r\n'Yes; and six years hence you may make nothing.'\r\n\r\n'That's true. But it would cost me more to live at the North.'\r\n\r\n'There you are mistaken. What do you pay for your corn, your pork, and\r\nyour hay, for instance?'\r\n\r\n'Well, my corn I have to bring round by vessel from Washington (North\r\nCarolina), and it costs me high when it gets here,--about ten bits (a\r\ndollar and twenty-five cents), I think.'\r\n\r\n'And in New York you could buy it now at sixty to seventy cents. What\r\ndoes your hay cost?'\r\n\r\n'Thirty-five dollars. I pay twenty for it in New York,--the balance is\r\nfreight and hauling.'\r\n\r\n'Your pork costs you two or three dollars, I suppose, for freight and\r\nhauling.'\r\n\r\n'Yes; about that.'\r\n\r\n'Then in those items you might save nearly a hundred per cent.; and they\r\nare the principal articles you consume.'\r\n\r\n'Yes; there's no denying that. But another thing is just as certain: it\r\ncosts less to support one of my niggers than one of your laboring men.'\r\n\r\n'That may be true. But it only shows that our laborers fare better than\r\nyour slaves.'\r\n\r\n'I'm not sure of that. I _am_ sure, however, that our slaves are more\r\ncontented than the run of laboring men at the North.'\r\n\r\n'That proves nothing. Your blacks have no hope, no chance to rise; and\r\nthey submit--though I judge not cheerfully--to an iron necessity. The\r\nNorthern laborer, if very poor, may be discontented; but discontent\r\nurges him to effort, and leads to the bettering of his condition. I tell\r\nyou, my friend, slavery is an expensive luxury. You Southern nabobs\r\n_will_ have it; and you have to _pay for it_.'\r\n\r\n'Well, we don't complain. But, seriously, my good fellow, I feel that\r\nI'm carrying out the design of the Almighty in holding my niggers. I\r\nthink he made the black to serve the white.'\r\n\r\n'_I_ think,' I replied, 'that whatever He designs works perfectly. Your\r\ninstitution certainly does not. It keeps the producer, who, in every\r\nsociety, is the really valuable citizen, in the lowest poverty, while it\r\nallows those who do nothing to be \"clad in fine linen, and to fare\r\nsumptuously every day.\"'\r\n\r\n'It does more than that, sir,' said Madam P----, with animation; 'it\r\nbrutalizes and degrades the _master_ and the _slave_; it separates\r\nhusband and wife, parent and child; it sacrifices virtuous women to the\r\nlust of brutal men; and it shuts millions out from the knowledge of\r\ntheir duty and their destiny. A good and just God could not have\r\ndesigned it; and it must come to an end.'\r\n\r\nIf lightning had struck in the room I could not have been more startled\r\nthan I was by the abrupt utterance of such language in a planter's\r\nhouse, in his very presence, and _by his slave_. The Colonel, however,\r\nexpressed no surprise and no disapprobation. It was evidently no new\r\nthing to him.\r\n\r\n'It is rare, madam,' I said, 'to hear such sentiments from a Southern\r\nlady--one reared among slaves.'\r\n\r\nBefore she could reply, the Colonel laughingly said,--\r\n\r\n'Bless you, Mr. K----, madam is an out-and-out abolitionist, worse by\r\nfifty per cent. than Garrison or Wendell Phillips. If she were at the\r\nNorth she would take to pantaloons, and \"stump\" the entire Free States;\r\nwouldn't you, Alice?'\r\n\r\n'I've no doubt of it,' rejoined the lady, smiling. 'But I fear I should\r\nhave poor success. I've tried for ten years to convert _you_, and Mr.\r\nK---- can see the result.'\r\n\r\nIt had grown late; and, with my head full of working niggers and white\r\nslave-women, I went to my apartment.\r\n\r\nThe next day was Sunday. It was near the close of December, yet the air\r\nwas as mild and the sun as warm as in our Northern October. It was\r\narranged at the breakfast-table that we all should attend service at\r\n'the meeting-house,' a church of the Methodist persuasion, located some\r\neight miles away; but as it wanted some hours of the time for religious\r\nexercises to commence, I strolled out after breakfast, with the Colonel,\r\nto inspect the stables of the plantation. 'Massa Tommy' accompanied us,\r\nwithout invitation; and in the Colonel's intercourse with him I observed\r\nas much freedom and familiarity as he would have shown to an\r\nacknowledged son. The youth's manners and conversation showed that great\r\nattention had been given to his education and training, and made it\r\nevident that the mother whose influence was forming his character,\r\nwhatever a false system of society had made her life, possessed some of\r\nthe best traits of her sex.\r\n\r\nThe stables, a collection of one-story framed buildings, about a hundred\r\nrods from the house, were well lighted and ventilated, and contained all\r\n'the modern improvements.' They were better built, warmer, more\r\ncommodious, and in every way more comfortable than the shanties occupied\r\nby the human cattle of the plantation. I remarked as much to the\r\nColonel, adding that one who did not know would infer that he valued his\r\nhorses more than his slaves.\r\n\r\n'That may be true,' he replied, laughing. 'Two of my horses here are\r\nworth more than any eight of my slaves;' at the same time calling my\r\nattention to two magnificent thorough-breds, one of which had made\r\n'2.32' on the Charleston course. The establishment of a Southern\r\ngentleman is not complete until it includes one or two of these useless\r\nappendages. I had an argument with my host as to their value compared\r\nwith that of the steam-engine, in which I forced him to admit that the\r\niron horse is the better of the two, because it performs more work, eats\r\nless, has greater speed, and is not liable to the spavin or the heaves;\r\nbut he wound up by saying, 'After all, I go for the thorough-breds. You\r\nYankees have but one test of value--use.'\r\n\r\nA ramble through the negro-quarters, which followed our visit to the\r\nstables, gave me some further glimpses of plantation life. Many of the\r\nhands were still away in pursuit of Moye, but enough remained to make it\r\nevident that Sunday is the happiest day in the darky calendar. Groups of\r\nall ages and colors were gathered in front of several of the cabins,\r\nsome singing, some dancing, and others chatting quietly together, but\r\nall enjoying themselves as heartily as so many young animals let loose,\r\nin a pasture. They saluted the Colonel and me respectfully, but each one\r\nhad a free, good-natured word for 'Massa Tommy,' who seemed an especial\r\nfavorite with them. The lad took their greetings in good part, but\r\npreserved an easy, unconscious dignity of manner that plainly showed he\r\ndid not know that _he_ too was of their despised, degraded race.\r\n\r\nThe Colonel, in a rapid way, gave me the character and peculiarities of\r\nnearly every one we met. The titles of some of them amused me greatly.\r\nAt every step we encountered individuals whose names have become\r\nhousehold words in every civilized country.[L] Julius Cæsar, slightly\r\nstouter than when he swam the Tiber, and somewhat tanned from long\r\nexposure to a Southern sun, was seated on a wood-pile, quietly smoking a\r\npipe; while near him, Washington, divested of regimentals, and clad in a\r\nmodest suit of reddish-gray, his thin locks frosted by time, and his\r\nfleshless visage showing great age, was gazing, in rapt admiration, at a\r\ngroup of dancers in front of old Lucy's cabin.\r\n\r\nIn this group about thirty men and women were making the ground quake\r\nand the woods ring with their unrestrained jollity. Marc Antony was\r\nrattling away at the bones, Nero fiddling as if Rome were burning, and\r\nHannibal clawing at a banjo as if the fate of Carthage hung on its\r\nstrings. Napoleon, as young and as lean as when he mounted the bridge of\r\nLodi, with the battle-smoke still on his face, was moving his legs even\r\nfaster than in the Russian retreat; and John Wesley was using his heels\r\nin a way that showed _they_ didn't belong to the Methodist church. But\r\nthe central figures of the group were Cato and Victoria. The lady had a\r\nface like a thunder-cloud, and a form that, if whitewashed, would have\r\noutsold the 'Greek Slave.' She was built on springs, and 'floated in\r\nthe dance' like a feather in a high wind. Cato's mouth was like an\r\nalligator's, but when it opened, it issued notes that would draw the\r\nspecie even in this time of general suspension. As we approached he was\r\nsinging a song, but he paused on perceiving us, when the Colonel,\r\ntossing a handful of coin among them, called out, 'Go on, boys; let the\r\ngentleman have some music; and you, Vic, show your heels like a beauty.'\r\n\r\nA general scramble followed, in which 'Vic's' sense of decorum forbade\r\nher to join, and she consequently got nothing. Seeing that, I tossed her\r\na silver piece, which she caught. Grinning her thanks, she shouted,\r\n'Now, clar de track, you nigs; start de music. I'se gwine to gib de\r\ngemman de breakdown.'\r\n\r\nAnd she did; and such a breakdown! 'We w'ite folks,' though it was no\r\nnew thing to the Colonel or Tommy, almost burst with laughter.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes nearly every negro on the plantation, attracted by the\r\npresence of the Colonel and myself, gathered around the performers; and\r\na shrill voice at my elbow called out, 'Look har, ye lazy,\r\ngood-for-nuffin' niggers, carn't ye fotch a cheer for Massa Davy and de\r\nstrange gemman?'\r\n\r\n'Is that you, Aunty?' said the Colonel. 'How d'ye do?'\r\n\r\n'Sort o' smart, Massa Davy; sort o' smart; how is ye?'\r\n\r\n'Pretty well, Aunty; pretty well. Have a seat.' And the Colonel helped\r\nher to one of the chairs that were brought for us, with as much\r\ntenderness as he would have shown to an aged white lady.\r\n\r\nThe 'exercises,' which had been suspended for a moment, recommenced, and\r\nthe old negress entered into them as heartily as the youngest present. A\r\nsong from Cato followed the dance, and then about twenty 'gentleman and\r\nlady' darkies joined, two at a time, in a half 'walk-round' half\r\nbreakdown, which the Colonel told me was what suggested the well-known\r\n'white-nigger' dance and song of Lucy Long. Other performances\r\nsucceeded, and the whole formed a scene impossible to describe. Such\r\nuproarious jollity, such full and perfect enjoyment, I had never seen in\r\nhumanity, black or white. The little nigs, only four or five years old,\r\nwould rush into the ring and shuffle away at the breakdowns till I\r\nfeared their short legs would come off; while all the darkies joined in\r\nthe songs, till the branches of the old pines above shook as if they too\r\nhad caught the spirit of the music. In the midst of it, the Colonel said\r\nto me, in an exultant tone,--\r\n\r\n'Well, my friend, what do you think of slavery _now_?'\r\n\r\n'About the same that I thought yesterday. I see nothing to change my\r\nviews.'\r\n\r\n'Why, are not these people happy? Is not this perfect enjoyment?'\r\n\r\n'Yes; just the same enjoyment that aunty's pigs are having; don't you\r\nhear them singing to the music? I'll wager they are the happier of the\r\ntwo.'\r\n\r\n'No; you are wrong. The higher faculties of the darkies are being\r\nbrought out here.'\r\n\r\n'I don't know that,' I replied. 'Within the sound of their voices, two\r\nof their fellows--victims to the inhumanity of slavery--are lying dead,\r\nand yet they make _Sunday_ 'hideous' with wild jollity, while they do\r\nnot know but Sam's fate may be theirs to-morrow.'\r\n\r\nSpite of his genuine courtesy and high breeding, a shade of displeasure\r\npassed over the Colonel's face as I made this remark. Rising to go, he\r\nsaid, a little impatiently, 'Ah, I see how it is; that d---- Garrison's\r\nsentiments have impregnated even you. How can the North and the South\r\nhold together when even moderate men like you and me are so far apart?'\r\n\r\n'But you,' I rejoined, good-humoredly, 'are not a moderate man. You and\r\nGarrison are of the same stripe, both extremists. You have mounted one\r\nhobby, _he_ another; that is all the difference.'\r\n\r\n'I should be sorry,' he replied, recovering his good-nature, 'to think\r\nmyself like Garrison. I consider him the ---- scoundrel unhung.'\r\n\r\n'No; I think he means well. But you are both fanatics, both 'bricks' of\r\nthe same material; we conservatives, like mortar, will hold you together\r\nand yet keep you apart.'\r\n\r\n'I, for one, _won't_ be held. If I can't get out of this cursed Union in\r\nany other way, I'll emigrate to Cuba.'\r\n\r\nI laughed, and just then, looking up, caught a glimpse of Jim, who\r\nstood, hat in hand, waiting to speak to the Colonel, but not daring to\r\ninterrupt a white conversation.\r\n\r\n'Hallo, Jim,' I said; 'have you got back?'\r\n\r\n'Yas, sar,' replied Jim, grinning all over as if he had some agreeable\r\nthing to communicate.\r\n\r\n'Where is Moye?' asked the Colonel.\r\n\r\n'Kotched, massa; I'se got de padlocks on him.'\r\n\r\n'Kotched,' echoed half a dozen darkies, who stood near enough to hear;\r\n'Ole Moye is kotched,' ran through the crowd, till the music ceased, and\r\na shout went up from two hundred black throats that made the old trees\r\ntremble.\r\n\r\n'Now gib him de lashes, Massa Davy,' cried the old nurse. 'Gib him what\r\nhe gabe pore Sam; but mine dat you keeps widin de law.'\r\n\r\n'Never fear, Aunty,' said the Colonel; 'I'll give him ----.'\r\n\r\nHow the Colonel kept his word will be told in another number.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nACTIVE SERVICE; OR, CAMPAIGNING IN WESTERN VIRGINIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have been to the war; I have seen armed secessionists, and I have seen\r\nthem run; but, more than that, I have seen _Active Service_. It was\r\n_active_, and no mistake.\r\n\r\nIn April last, my country needed my services; I had been playing\r\nsoldier, and I felt it my duty to respond to the call of the President.\r\nI did respond. I uncovered my head, raised my right hand, and solemnly\r\nswore to obey the President of the United States for three months. The\r\nthree months have expired, and I am once more a free American citizen,\r\nand for the first time in my life I know what it is to be _free_.\r\n\r\nACTIVE SERVICE! That's what the military men call it. I have often read\r\nof it; I have heard men talk about it; but now I have seen it. I meet\r\npeople every day who congratulate me on my safe return, and say, 'I\r\nsuppose you are going again?' Perhaps I am.\r\n\r\nIt was a beautiful day when our company left home, and what a crowd of\r\npeople assembled to see us off! What a waving of banners and\r\nhandkerchiefs; what shouting and cheering; what an endless amount of\r\nhand-shaking; how many 'farewells,' 'good-bys,' and\r\n'take-care-of-yourselves,' were spoken; all of this had to be gone\r\nthrough with, and our company run the gauntlet and nobody was hurt.\r\n\r\nGoing to war is no child's play, as many seem to suppose. Once sworn in\r\nas a _private_, you become a tool, a mere thing, to do another's\r\nbidding. I do not say this to discourage enlistments,--far from it. I am\r\nonly speaking the truth. 'Forewarned, forearmed.' If there is a hard\r\nlife upon earth, it is that of a common soldier; he may be the bravest\r\nman in the army, he may perform an endless amount of daring deeds, but\r\nit is seldom that he gains a tangible reward. He does all the fighting,\r\nhe performs all the drudgery, he is plundered by the sutler, he lives\r\non pork and hard-bread, but he gets none of the honors of a victory. As\r\nBiglow says,--\r\n\r\n    'Lieutenants are the lowest grade that help pick up the coppers.'\r\n\r\nI belonged to an artillery company. I joined this because somebody told\r\nme I could ride. I wish I had that _somebody_ by the throat. The idea of\r\na man's _riding_ over the mountains of Western Virginia! I won't call it\r\nridiculous, for that's no name for it.\r\n\r\nI will pass over the uninteresting part of the campaign, that of lying\r\nin camp, as everybody now-a-days has ample opportunity to judge of camp\r\nlife, in the cities, and take the reader at once into 'active service,'\r\nand show the hardships and trials, together with the fun (for soldiers\r\n_do_ have their good times) of campaigning.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th day of May, 1861, we arrived at Parkersburgh, Va. It was my\r\nfirst visit to the Old Dominion. We had been taught when youngsters at\r\nschool to regard Virginia as a sort of Holy Land, 'flowing with milk and\r\nhoney,' and the mother of all that is great and noble in the United\r\nStates, if not in the world. We were 'going South.'\r\n\r\nIt was at the close of a warm spring day that we landed there; the sun\r\nwas just sinking in the west as the boat rounded-to at the wharf. We\r\njumped ashore, and for the first time in our lives inhaled the 'sacred\r\natmosphere' of the so-called Southern Confederacy. All was bustle and\r\nconfusion; but we soon had our traps, _i.e._, guns, caissons and horses,\r\nunloaded, and a little after dark were on the march. We proceeded a few\r\nmiles out of town, and at midnight halted, pitched our tents, stationed\r\nguards, and all who were so fortunate as not to be detailed for duty\r\nwere soon sound asleep.\r\n\r\nAt Grafton, one hundred miles east of Parkersburgh, we were told there\r\nwas a party of some two thousand rebels. This then was the object of our\r\nvisit to Western Virginia, to drive these men east of the\r\nmountains,--from whence most of them came,--and to protect the honor of\r\nour flag in that portion of Virginia now known by the name of Kanawha.\r\n\r\nAt sunrise on the 30th, we marched to the depot of the north-western\r\nbranch of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, and, after a hard half-day's\r\nwork in loading our guns, horses and wagons, stowed ourselves away in\r\ncattle cars, and were once more ready for a start. As we rattled along\r\nover the railroad, the scenery for the first few miles was beautiful,\r\nand we began to think that Old Virginny was really the flower of the\r\nUnion. But a 'change soon came over the spirit of our dreams.'\r\n\r\nAfter passing a small shanty, called Petroleum,--from the numerous\r\noil-wells in the vicinity,--we met with the first really hard work we\r\nhad seen since we began the life of a soldier. Here the rebels had burnt\r\none of the railroad bridges, and all hands had to 'fall in' and repair\r\ndamages. Never did men work with a better will. Slender youths, who, if\r\nthey had been told one month before, that on the 30th day of May, 1861,\r\nthey would be laying rails and cutting timber for Uncle Sam, for eleven\r\ndollars a month, would have pitied their informant as insane, were here\r\nworking with a will that showed what a man can do if he only sets\r\nhimself about it. For two days and a night we toiled and ceased not, and\r\nwhen, on the evening of the second day, we passed over the 'soldiers'\r\nbridge' in safety, such a shout rent the air as I never heard before.\r\n\r\nA few miles beyond the burnt bridge, the scenery began to change. In the\r\nclear starlight, instead of beautiful streams and fine farms, we beheld\r\nhills and mountains covered with an almost impenetrable growth of\r\nunderbrush, and large rocks hanging over our heads, ready to be hurled\r\ndown upon us by some unseen hand, and to crush our little handful of\r\nmen. On we went, at a snail's pace, till about ten o'clock, P.M., when\r\nour joy was again turned to woe, for here too the dogs of Jeff Davis had\r\nbeen doing their work, and had burnt another bridge. We waited until\r\nmorning, and then, after some hard swearing, were once more transformed\r\ninto 'greasy mechanics,' and before the sun went down had passed to the\r\n'other side of Jordan' in safety.\r\n\r\nHere began our first experience of the hospitality of the sons, or\r\nrather daughters, of Virginia.\r\n\r\nA small farm-house stood near the bridge, numerous cows were grazing in\r\nthe pasture close by, and everything denoted a home of comfort and\r\nplenty. This, I thought, must be the home of some F.F.V., and I will\r\ntake a pail--or rather camp kettle--and 'sarah forth' to buy a few\r\nquarts of milk. Wending my way to the house, I knocked at the door, and\r\ninstantly six female heads protruded from the window. Presently one of\r\nthem, an elderly woman, opened the door, and inquired what I wanted.\r\n\r\n'Have you any milk to spare?' I said.\r\n\r\n'I reckon,' replied the woman.\r\n\r\n'I would like to get a few quarts,' I said, handing her my kettle. I\r\ntook a seat on the door-step, and wondered what these six women were\r\ndoing in this lonely spot. They evidently lived alone, for not a man was\r\nto be seen around. The table was spread for dinner, six cups, six\r\nplates, six spoons, and no more. I was about to ask for the man of the\r\nhouse, when the old woman returned with my kettle of milk.\r\n\r\n'How much?' I asked, as I thrust my hand deep into my pocket, and drew\r\nforth one of the few coins it was my fortune to possess.\r\n\r\n'Only four bits,' said the ancient female.\r\n\r\nI thought milk must have 'riz' lately, but I paid the money and left.\r\n\r\nFrom observations since taken, I infer these six women were 'grass\r\nwidows,' whose husbands had enlisted in the rebel army, and left them\r\nbehind to plunder the Union troops by selling corn-bread and milk for\r\nten times its value.\r\n\r\nI took a seat on a log, and congratulated myself on the prospect of a\r\ngood dinner. By the aid of a stone I managed to crumble 'two shingles'\r\nof hard bread into a cup of the milk, and then, with an appetite such as\r\nI never enjoyed in _America_, sat to work. I took one mouthful, when,\r\nlo! the milk was sour! Hurling cup and contents toward the hospitable\r\nmansion, I fell back upon my regular diet of salt pork.\r\n\r\nLeaving the Virginia damsels to plunder the next regiment of Federals\r\nthat came along, we were soon once more on our way, and on Saturday, the\r\n1st of June, arrived at Clarksburgh. Here we learned that the rebels had\r\nleft Grafton and gone to Phillippi, some twenty miles back in the\r\ncountry. We remained at Clarksburgh until Sunday morning, when, once\r\nmore stowing ourselves 'three deep' on flats and stock cars, we\r\nproceeded as far as Webster. Here we left the railroad, and pursued the\r\nrebels afoot.\r\n\r\nWebster is a big name, and there we flattered ourselves we could get\r\nsome of the comforts of life. But once again we were doomed to\r\ndisappointment. Two stores, a dozen or so of shanties, and a secession\r\npole, make up this mighty town. Parkersburgh is a 'right smart place;'\r\nClarksburgh 'isn't much to speak of;' the only thing of interest about\r\nit is the home of Senator Carlisle; but Webster is a little the worst\r\nplace I have ever seen. I am sorry to say, in the language of the great\r\nman whose name it bears, 'It still lives.'\r\n\r\nObserving a shanty on the summit of a small hill, with the words, 'Meals\r\nat all hours,' over the door, I wended my way over sundry cow-paths and\r\nthrough by-lanes towards it, until at last, fatigued, and with hands\r\ntorn and bleeding from catching hold of roots and bushes to keep myself\r\nfrom falling, I arrived at the summit of the hill. A young woman stood\r\nin the door-way of the shanty, and I asked her if I could obtain a\r\ndinner.\r\n\r\n'Yes,' she said. 'Walk in and take a cheer.' She shoved a three-legged\r\nstool towards me, and I took it.\r\n\r\nShe was about eighteen years of age, and had a very pretty\r\nface,--though it was thickly covered with a coating of the sacred\r\nsoil,--a musical voice, and a small hand. Her eyes sparkled like\r\nfire-flies on a June night, and her hair hung in wavy ringlets over what\r\nwould have been an 'alabaster brow,' had it not been for the\r\nsuperabundance of _dirt_ above mentioned. She was the only good-looking\r\nwoman I saw in Western Virginia.\r\n\r\nI took a seat at the table, and from a broken cup drank a few swallows\r\nof tolerable coffee. As for the edibles, 'twas the same old story,--corn\r\nbread and maple molasses, fried pork and onions. I staid there perhaps\r\nfifteen minutes, and learned from my hostess that Webster was, previous\r\nto the war 'a right smart village,' but that the male inhabitants had\r\nmostly joined the rebel army, then at Phillippi. She, different from\r\nmost women I met in Virginia, expressed sympathy for the Union cause. It\r\nseemed so strange to find a _Union_ woman in that part of the country, I\r\nwas induced to ask if Webster had the honor of being her birth-place.\r\n\r\n'Oh no,' she said; 'I was born in 'Hio.'\r\n\r\nThat solved the whole mystery. I willingly paid the 'four bits' for my\r\ndinner; and, as a storm was coming on, made all haste back to the\r\nrailroad, where we were getting ready to march on Phillippi, distance\r\nthirteen Virginian, or about twenty _American_, miles.\r\n\r\n'Fall in, Company Q!' shouted the orderly. 'Numbers one, two, three, and\r\nfour, do so and so; five, six, seven, and eight, do this, that, and the\r\nother!' So at it we went; and never in my life did I perform a harder\r\nafternoon's work than on Sunday, the 2d of June, 1861. It was a warm,\r\nsultry day, and our morning's ride in the cars had been dusty and\r\nfatiguing; and when, about dusk, a heavy rain-storm set in and drenched\r\nus to the skin, we were sorry-looking objects indeed.\r\n\r\nAlthough we had been in service six weeks, we had but just received our\r\nuniforms that morning. My pants, when I put them on, were about six\r\ninches too long, and the sleeves of my blouse ditto. After marching all\r\nnight in the rain, my trowsers only came down as far as my knees; they\r\nshrank two feet in twelve hours. Many of the men threw away their shoddy\r\nuniforms after wearing them one day, as they were totally unfit for use.\r\nThey tore as easily as so much paper, and were no protection whatever\r\nfrom the weather. Somebody, I don't pretend to say who, made a good\r\nthing when he furnished them to the government. No doubt they were\r\nsupplied by some _loyal_ and _respectable_ citizen, who would not\r\nknowingly cheat his country out of a penny! We have reaped a bountiful\r\nharvest of such patriots during the past year. May the Lord love them!\r\n\r\nAt eleven o'clock on the night of the 2d of June we started for\r\nPhillippi. It commenced raining about seven o'clock in the evening, and\r\nwe were all wet to the skin. The night was very dark, and the road,\r\nthough they called it a 'pike,' was one of the worst imaginable; it\r\nwound 'round and round,'--\r\n\r\n  'It turned in and turned out,\r\n  Leaving beholders still in doubt\r\n  Whether the wretched muddy track\r\n  Were going South or coming back,'--\r\n\r\nand seemed to run in every direction but the right one. It was a road\r\nsuch as can be found only in Virginia. The mud was almost up to the hubs\r\nof the wagon-wheels; the horses pulled, the drivers laid on the lash and\r\na string of oaths at the same time; the wind blew, and the rain came\r\ndown in torrents. More than once on that awful march did we lend a\r\nhelping hand to get the horses out of some 'slough of Despond.' Over the\r\nmountains and through the woods we went, at the rate of about two miles\r\nan hour. Many gave out and lay down by the wayside; and when at last\r\nmorning dawned, a more pitiable set of beings never were seen upon\r\nearth. The men looked haggard and wan, the horses could hardly stand,\r\nand we were in anything but a good condition for invading an enemy's\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nAt daylight we were within two miles of Phillippi. Col. (now General)\r\nLander was with the advance, and had discovered that the enemy were\r\nready for a retreat. Their baggage was loaded, and if we did not make\r\nthe last two miles at 'double-quick,' he was fearful we would be too\r\nlate to accomplish the object of the expedition. So the order was given,\r\n'Double-quick!' and jaded horses and almost lifeless men rushed forward,\r\nbuoyed up with the prospect of having a brush with the rascals who had\r\ngiven us so much trouble.\r\n\r\nWe had gone about a mile and a half, when, at a turn in the road, an old\r\nwoman rushed out from a log cabin, and, in a loud and commanding voice,\r\nexclaimed,--\r\n\r\n'Halt, artillery, or I'll shoot every one of you!'\r\n\r\nNot obeying the order, she fired three shots at us, none of which took\r\neffect. At the same time three men rushed from the back of the house\r\ntoward the rebel camp at the foot of the hill, shouting at the top of\r\ntheir voices to give warning of our approach. A squad of our fellows\r\ntook after them, and soon overtook them in a corn-field, when they\r\ndenied coming from the house, and said they were out planting corn! A\r\nlikely story, as it was hardly daylight, and the rain was falling in\r\ntorrents. However, during the forenoon they took _oath_, and were set\r\nfree!\r\n\r\nPast the log house we went at 'double-quick,' and in less time than it\r\ntakes to tell it, the artillery took position in a small piece of wood\r\non the summit of a hill overlooking the town. At once the order was\r\ngiven, 'Action front!' and the first the rebels knew of our approach was\r\nthe rattling of canister among their tents. Out they swarmed, like bees\r\nfrom a molested hive. This way and that the chivalry flew, and yet\r\nscarcely knew which way to run. 'Bould sojer boys,' with nothing but\r\ntheir underclothes on, mounted their nags bareback, and fled 'over the\r\nhills and far away' towards Beverley, firing as they ran a few random\r\nshots. Before the infantry reached the town most of them had made good\r\ntheir escape, leaving behind, however, nearly all their baggage, a large\r\nnumber of horses, wagons, tents, and about eight hundred stand of arms,\r\ntogether with a nicely-cooked breakfast, which they had no idea they\r\nwere preparing for 'Lincoln's hirelings.'\r\n\r\nWe took about fifty prisoners, among them the man who wounded Col. (now\r\nGeneral) Kelley. They were retained until the next day, when the oath\r\nwas administered, and they were let loose to rejoin their companions in\r\narms. About four weeks after this, we had the pleasure of retaking,\r\nseveral of these fellows; some of them, in fact, were taken three or\r\nfour times, each time taking the oath, and being set at liberty, and\r\neach time, true to their nature--and Jeff Davis--immediately taking up\r\narms again against the government.\r\n\r\nPhillippi, from any of the neighboring hills, or rather mountains,\r\npresents a rather picturesque appearance. It was, previous to the war, a\r\nplace of about one thousand inhabitants. It boasts a good court-house, a\r\nbank, and two hotels, and was by far the most civilized-looking town we\r\nhad then seen in Virginia. But, alas! what a change had come over its\r\nonce happy populace. When we entered it, not a dozen inhabitants were\r\nleft. We were told that Phillippi was the head-quarters of rebellion in\r\nWestern Virginia. Here was published the Barbour County _Jeffersonian_,\r\na rabid secession newspaper, now no more, for the press was demolished,\r\nand the types thrown into a well. The editor had joined the rebel army a\r\nfew days before our arrival, and was among the loudest denunciators of\r\nour government. He boasted he would shed the last drop of his blood (he\r\nwas very careful as to shedding the first) before he would retreat one\r\ninch before the _Abolitionists_. We afterwards learned from some of his\r\nmen that he was among the first to mount his horse and run to the\r\nmountains; the last that was seen of him he was going at lightning speed\r\ntoward Richmond, and in all probability _il court encore_,--he is\r\nrunning yet.\r\n\r\nWe had taken possession of the town and most of the enemy's baggage and\r\nequipments; still our commanding officer was not satisfied, neither were\r\nthe men. We had intended to completely surround the enemy and to cut off\r\nevery possible chance of his retreat. The attack was to have been made\r\nat five o'clock, A.M.; but one column, that which marched from Grafton,\r\nwas about twenty minutes too late, and when at last it did make its\r\nappearance, it entered town by the wrong road, having been misled by the\r\nguide. The consequence was, the enemy retreated on the Beverley road,\r\nwhere they met with little or no resistance. Our men were too much\r\nfatigued to follow the fast-fleeing traitors, and most of them made good\r\ntheir escape.\r\n\r\nAfter the excitement of the attack, the men dropped down wherever they\r\nstood, in the streets, in the fields, or in the woods, and slept soundly\r\nuntil noon, the rain continuing to fall in torrents. But what was that\r\nto men worn out with marching? I never slept better than when lying in a\r\nnewly-plowed corn-field, with the mud over my ankles, the rain pelting\r\nme in the face, and not a blanket to cover me.\r\n\r\n_Bang! bang! bang!_ and up I jumped from my bed of mud, thinking the\r\nfight had again commenced. Somewhat bewildered, I rubbed the 'sacred\r\nsoil' from my eyes and looked about me. It was noon; the rain had\r\nceased, and from the constant sound of musketry, I supposed a battle was\r\nthen raging. But instead of fighting the 'secesh,' I soon found the\r\nIndiana boys were making havoc among the fowls of the chivalry. They\r\nfired too much at random to suit my taste, and I made tracks for a safer\r\nabode. Beating a hasty retreat to the hill where my company was\r\nstationed, I found a large crowd gathered around some of the captured\r\nwagons, overhauling the plunder. And what a mixed-up mess! Old guns,\r\nsabres, bowie-knives, pistols made in Richmond in 1808, old uniforms\r\nthat looked like the property of some strolling actor, and love-letters\r\nwhich the bold chivalry had received from fair damsels, who all\r\nexpressed the desire that, their 'lovyers' would bring home, Old Abe's\r\nscalp. These letters afforded great amusement to our boys, though it was\r\nhard to read many of them, and were they put into print, Artemus Ward\r\nwould have to look to his 'lorrels.'\r\n\r\nBang! bang! bang! they kept on shooting till dark. It is useless to say\r\nwe had chickens for supper that night; and I would not be surprised if\r\nthe chicken crop of Phillippi and vicinity should be rather small for a\r\nfew years to come.\r\n\r\nWild rumors were running through the camp all day that the 'secesh' had\r\nbeen reinforced, were ten thousand strong, and, with forty pieces of\r\ncannon, would attack us that night. Some said they were commanded by\r\nGov. Wise, the lunatic, others by Beauregard, and some positively\r\nasserted that Jeff Davis led the rebel forces himself. At all events, it\r\nwas pretty well settled that we were to be attacked forthwith. Our men\r\nslept on their arms, but not a secesh appeared.\r\n\r\nI, as usual, was on guard that night, and, feeling that a great\r\nresponsibility rested on my shoulders, was 'doubly armed.' A well-known\r\nprofessor, a member of the same company as myself, was on the first\r\nrelief; I was on the second. I went on duty at ten o'clock, P.M., and\r\nthe professor kindly loaned me his revolver, and, in addition, soon\r\nreturned with an extra musket, a secession sabre, and one of the\r\ncaptured pistols. Thus loaded down with swords, pistols, and muskets,\r\nand guarding a six-pounder, I felt _tolerably_ safe. After walking up\r\nand down my beat a few times, I found the two muskets began to feel\r\nrather heavy, and the two sabres to be rather uncomfortable dangling\r\nabout my legs; and thinking that two revolvers and a _secesh_ pistol\r\nwould be all that I could use to advantage, I divested myself of the\r\nextra equipments, and passed the residue of my 'two-hours' watch' in\r\ncommitting to memory 'my last dying words,' for use in case the secesh\r\nput an end to my existence.\r\n\r\nOur colonel's name was Barnett; the countersign for the night was Buena\r\nVista. About eleven o'clock I observed a man coming towards me. 'Halt!'\r\nI exclaimed; 'who goes there?'\r\n\r\n'A _friendt_,' was the reply.\r\n\r\n'Advance, friend, and give the countersign.'\r\n\r\nThe man walked towards me, and whispered in my ear 'Barnett's Sister!'\r\nat the same time attempting to pass. Placing my bayonet close against\r\nhis breast, I ordered him to 'halt!' and called for the corporal of the\r\nguard. The Dutchman--for such he was--begged and plead, but it was of no\r\nuse; I told him he was trying to 'run the guard,' and he must go to the\r\nguard-house.\r\n\r\n'Barnett's Sister! Barnett's Sister! Barnett's Sister!' shouted the\r\nDutchman. 'I know nothing about Barnett's Sister,' said I; 'stop your\r\nnoise, or you will rouse the camp.'\r\n\r\nJust then, the officer of the guard came round. I stated the case to\r\nhim, and the man was taken to the guard-house. The next morning he was\r\nreleased, and on inquiry at head-quarters it was found that he had the\r\npassword, but had confounded 'Buena Vista' with 'Barnett's Sister.' We\r\nall enjoyed a good laugh over it, and ever after 'Barnett's Sister' was\r\nthe password for all who attempted to 'run the guard.'\r\n\r\nWe lay at Phillippi nearly six weeks. Every day or two an alarm would\r\noccur, the long roll would beat, and the men would form in line of\r\nbattle. It is needless to say the alarms were all false. There are\r\nalways hundreds of rumors in every camp, and ours was not an exception.\r\nBut after the first week we paid little attention to the many wild\r\nreports which were in circulation. Although Gov. Wise had said he would\r\ntake dinner in Phillippi or in ---- on the fourth of July;\r\nnotwithstanding Gov. Letcher had issued a proclamation warning us to\r\nleave the State in twenty-four hours or he would hang every one of us;\r\nalthough a proclamation dated Staunton, Va., June 7th, 1861, stated to\r\nthe people of Western Virginia that their little band of _volunture (?)_\r\nhad been forced from Phillippi by the ruthless Northern foe, led on by\r\ntraitors and tories, and that Jeff Davis and John Letcher had sent to\r\ntheir aid a force of cavalry, artillery and rifles; and although the\r\nproclamation wound up by saying To-morrow an ARMY will follow! we felt\r\ntolerably safe at Phillippi. We had determined, if the aforesaid army\r\ndid appear, it should have a warm reception.\r\n\r\nEvery day or two scouting parties went out and captured a few stray\r\n'Bush-Whackers,' to whom the oath was administered, and they were\r\nreleased. Days and weeks passed, but the army of Davis, Beauregard, and\r\nCo., failed to appear. They had, however, congregated and entrenched\r\nthemselves at Laurel Hill, about thirteen miles east of Phillippi.\r\n\r\nWe were reinforced from time to time, until our force numbered some\r\nforty-five hundred men, when Gen. McClellan determined to rout the enemy\r\nfrom Laurel Hill and Rich Mountain. How well he succeeded, history will\r\ntell.\r\n\r\nOn the night of the 6th of July, we left Phillippi for Laurel Hill,\r\nstarting at midnight. The road was rather rough, but much better than we\r\nexpected to find it. When we were within about five miles of the enemy's\r\ncamps; we passed a toll-gate, where an old woman came to the door to\r\n'collect toll.' Some of our boys stopped at the house to get a drink of\r\nwater, and asked the old lady how far it was to camp,--meaning the rebel\r\ncamp. 'About four miles,' she said, 'but you can't get in without a\r\npass.'\r\n\r\nThe artillery was just then passing her door; the boys pointed to that,\r\nand told her 'they thought they had a pass that would take them in.'\r\n\r\n'Oh!' she exclaimed, as the thought struck her that we were Federals,\r\n'you won't find it as easy work as you did at Phillippi; they're going\r\nto fight this time.'\r\n\r\nOn our return home this same woman was at the door, but she didn't\r\ndemand _toll_ this time. 'Well, old lady,' said one of our fellows,\r\n'what do you think _now_ about the fighting qualities of your men?'\r\n\r\n  'They who fight and run away,\r\n  Will live to fight another day,'\r\n\r\nshe exclaimed, and, slamming the door, vanished from sight, I trust\r\nforever.\r\n\r\nAt daylight we drove in the rebel pickets at Laurel Hill. We were within\r\na mile and a half of their main camp, and halted there to await orders\r\nfrom Gen. McClellan, before beginning the attack. He was advancing on\r\nthe enemy at Rich Mountain and Beverley.\r\n\r\nWe threw a few shells into the rebel camp, producing great consternation\r\namong their men and horses. For four days we kept up skirmishing, but on\r\nthe fifth day it rained, and little was done. All were anxious to\r\ncommence the attack, but, as we had heard nothing from Gen. McClellan,\r\nall had to 'wait for orders.' That night the enemy, hearing of the\r\nFederal victory at Rich Mountain, and the occupation of Beverley by\r\nMcClellan, and evidently thinking himself in a 'bad fix,' retreated from\r\nLaurel Hill toward St. George. In the morning our forces took possession\r\nof his camp and fortifications, and part of our column pursued the\r\nflying forces, overtaking them at Cornick's Ford, where a sharp\r\nengagement ensued, which resulted in a total rout of the rebels, and the\r\ndeath of Gen. Garnett. Only a portion of his army escaped over the\r\nmountains to Eastern Virginia.\r\n\r\nSo hasty was the retreat from Laurel Hill, that the enemy left behind\r\nall the sick and wounded, telling them the Union troops would kill them\r\nas soon as they took possession of their camp. A large number of tents,\r\na quantity of flour, and a few muskets, fell into our hands. The\r\nfortifications at Laurel Hill were strong, and evidently planned and\r\nconstructed by men who understood their business.\r\n\r\nAmong the numerous letters which we found in the rebel camp, was one\r\nwritten to one of the Richmond papers, during the _siege_ of Laurel\r\nHill. In that part of the letter which was intended for publication, the\r\nwriter said:--\r\n\r\n'The Yankees have at last arrived, about ten thousand strong. For the\r\npast two days we have had some sharp skirmishing, during which time we\r\nhave killed one hundred of the Hessians. We have, as yet, lost but one\r\nman.'\r\n\r\nIn a _private note_ to the editor, the writer adds:--\r\n\r\n'I guess the Yankees have got us this time. There is a regiment here who\r\ncall themselves the Indiana Ninth, but they lie,--they are regulars.\r\nThey have got good rifles, and they take good aim. If it wasn't for\r\nthis, we would attack them.'\r\n\r\nThis little item shows how the masses of the Southern people are\r\ndeceived. Through the medium of the press they are made to believe they\r\nare gaining great victories, and repulsing the 'abolitionists' at every\r\nstep, killing hundreds of our men, and losing none of their own. Our\r\ntotal loss at Laurel Hill was six men. The rebel loss, as near as could\r\nbe ascertained, was forty. The rebel leaders know they are playing a\r\ngame for life or death, and so long as they can keep in power by\r\ndeceiving the people, just so long will this rebellion continue. Could\r\nthe _truth_ be forced upon the people of the South, the rebellion would\r\ngo down as quickly as it rose.\r\n\r\nMany laughable incidents occurred while we were skirmishing with the\r\nenemy at Laurel Hill. We received a newspaper containing the message of\r\nPresident Lincoln. One of the Indiana boys, thinking it might do the\r\nsecesh good to hear a few loyal sentiments, mounted a stump, paper in\r\nhand, and exclaimed, 'I say, secesh, don't you want to hear old Abe's\r\nmessage?' He then commenced reading, but had proceeded only a short way,\r\nbefore 'ping, ping' came the rifle balls around the stump; down jumped\r\nIndiana, convinced that reading even a President's message amidst a\r\nshower of bullets isn't so agreeable, after all.\r\n\r\nWe staid at Laurel Hill about two weeks. The enemy had been completely\r\nrouted from that part of Virginia, and our term of enlistment having\r\nexpired, our thoughts began to turn homeward. That ninety days'\r\nsoldiering was the longest three months we ever experienced. It seemed\r\nan age since we had tasted a good meal, and all were anxious to once\r\nmore cross the Ohio, and see a civilized country. The long looked-for\r\norder came at last, ''Bout face!' and we were on our homeward march. A\r\nmore jovial, ragged, dirty, and hungry set of men, were never mustered\r\nout of service. We reached Camp Chase at Columbus, Ohio, about the last\r\nof July, and as each man delivered up his knapsack and etceteras, he\r\nfelt as if a 'great weight' had been taken from his shoulders. We were\r\nonce more free men; no one could order us about, tell us where we should\r\nor where we should not go. There was no more touching of hats to upstart\r\nlieutenants and half-witted captains or colonels. We could go where we\r\nliked, and do as we pleased, and not be reported, or sent to the\r\nguard-house. If my memory serves me aright, we _did_ do pretty much as\r\nwe pleased; in other words, for two days, 'we made Rome howl!'\r\n\r\nWhat we saw of Western Virginia and its inhabitants left anything but a\r\nfavorable impression on our minds. The country is wild and romantic, but\r\ngood for little or nothing for farming purposes. The houses are mostly\r\nbuilt of logs, being little more than mere huts, and around each of\r\nthese 'mansions' may be seen at least a dozen young 'tow-heads,' who are\r\nbrought up in ignorance and filth. The inhabitants are lazy and\r\nignorant, raising hardly enough to keep starvation from their doors.\r\nSchool houses are almost unknown; we did not see one in the whole course\r\nof our march; the consequence is, not more than one in ten of the\r\npopulation can read or write. And the few who 'can just make out to\r\nspell' are worse off than their more ignorant brethren.\r\n\r\n  'A little learning is a dangerous thing.'\r\n\r\nAnd these people know just enough to make them _dangerous_. They have\r\nread in some of their county newspapers that Vice-President Hamlin is a\r\nnegro, and that Lincoln is waging this war for the purpose of liberating\r\nthe slaves and killing their masters. This they believe, and any amount\r\nof reasoning cannot convince them to the contrary. It seems to be enough\r\nfor them to know that they are _Virginians_; upon this, and this alone,\r\nthey live and have their being. They are by far the most wretched and\r\ndegraded people in America,--I had almost said in the world. The women,\r\nif possible, are worse than the men; they go dressed in a loose, uncouth\r\nmanner, barefooted and bareheaded; their principal occupation is chewing\r\ntobacco and plundering Union troops by getting ten prices for their\r\neggs, butter, and corn bread. And these are the people our children--and\r\ntheir fathers before them--have been taught to regard as the true\r\n_chivalry_ of America! The people of the United States are beginning to\r\nsee that Virginia and her sons have been greatly over-estimated. That\r\nVirginia has produced true and great men, no one will deny. There are a\r\nfew such still within her borders; but, taking her as a whole, the\r\npicture I have drawn is a true one.\r\n\r\nBy my soldiering experience I learned some things which it would have\r\nbeen impossible to learn had I never 'gone for a soger.' First, I\r\nascertained--shall I say from my _personal_ experience?--that a man\r\ndressed in soldier-clothes can stand twice as much bad liquor as one\r\nclothed in the garb of a citizen. Secondly, that to be a good soldier a\r\nman should be able to go at least forty-eight hours without eating,\r\ndrinking, or sleeping, and then endure guard-duty all night in a\r\ndrenching rain, without grumbling or fault-finding. Thirdly, I _think_ I\r\nhave discovered that the martial road to glory '_is a hard road to\r\ntravel_.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA CABINET SESSION.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The President: Secretaries Seward, Chase, Bates, Smith, Blair and\r\nWelles. Enter Mr. Stanton._\r\n\r\n_Mr. Lincoln._ Gentlemen, I officially present Mr. Stanton!\r\n\r\n[_Mr. Stanton, bowing with graceful dignity, seats himself at the\r\ntable._]\r\n\r\n_Mr. Seward (breaking the momentary pause in his jocular way)._\r\nRemember, Mr. Secretary of War, you are now in the old chair of Floyd\r\nand Davis: and sit thee down as if on nettles.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Chase._ Aye; but out of the 'nettle danger' pluck thou 'the flower\r\nsafety.'\r\n\r\n_Mr. Stanton (with emphasis)._ Believe me, I appreciate not so much the\r\nhonor as the responsibilities of my new position. I claim a good omen,\r\nfor, as I turned just now towards the gate, a little boy, seated upon\r\none of the granite blocks for the new building hereabout, trolled out as\r\nmy salutation the lines of the national air,--\r\n\r\n  'Then conquer we must, for our cause it is just,\r\n  And this be our motto, In God is our trust.'\r\n\r\n_Mr. Welles._ Amen!\r\n\r\n_Mr. Bates._ I suppose you passed not a few interesting hours in this\r\nroom at the twilight of Mr. Buchanan's day, whilst holding _my_\r\nportfolio?\r\n\r\n_Mr. Stanton._ Too momentous to be called by _me_ interesting.\r\nPosterity, reading, will say _that_. And those twilight hours, as you\r\nfelicitously term them, were followed by anxious vigils. But these\r\nbelong to confidences.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Lincoln (abruptly and familiarly)._ Talking of confidences, what do\r\nyou think of the news about Zollicoffer?\r\n\r\n_Mr. Stanton._ It appears reliable, and is a most providential success.\r\nEastern Tennessee was tending to the position which Lucknow sustained\r\ntowards the Indian rebellion. It is now relieved, and a fortnight or so\r\nwill bring intelligence that the whole of it has practically joined\r\nforces to Western Virginia. I regard it as of the highest importance to\r\nprove, by industrious acts, that we recognize and reward the sufferings\r\nof these American Albigenses in their Cumberland fastnesses. How grandly\r\nwould swell the old Miltonian hymn, properly paraphrased, when a brigade\r\nof the loyal Tennessians may sing\r\n\r\n  'Avenge, Columbia, thy slaughtered hosts, whose bones\r\n  Lie scattered on the Western mountains cold,'\r\n\r\nand so forth!\r\n\r\n_Mr. Lincoln._ Now, you are stepping into Seward's province. _He_ is the\r\npoet of my cabinet!\r\n\r\n_Mr. Seward._ Granted for the argument: but there is more truth than\r\npoetry in what our new brother has just said. Throughout how many weary\r\nmonths have those brave thousands who voted against secession awaited\r\nthe crack of our rifles and our cannon-smoke--true music and sacred\r\nincense to them.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Blair (practically)._ Next to the border States we must take care\r\nof the newspapers.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Welles._ Ah, those newspapers: bothersome as urchins in a nursery,\r\nand yet as necessary to the perfect development of life's enjoyment.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Chase._ Well said for the navy. But what do you say of the\r\nmagnificent Neckars, whose monied articles from Boston to Chicago would\r\nswamp the treasury in a week, if they were believed in?\r\n\r\n_Mr. Lincoln._ Being born and raised so far from the great metropolitan\r\ncentres, I don't seem to take to newspapers so kindly as the rest of you\r\ndo.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Stanton._ With great respect to your Honor (as we say in court), I\r\ndeem it a great mistake to neglect newspaper suggestions, however\r\nprovincial. 'Do you hear (as Hamlet says), let them be well used; for\r\nthey are the abstract and brief chronicles of the time.' And your\r\nmetropolitan editor, after all, follows the bent of the public opinion\r\nof the provinces as he scissors it from his thousand and one exchanges.\r\nThe village or country editor has time to mix among the people, and\r\nhears them talk to reproduce it artistically. The city editor finds\r\nlittle time for this. Besides, there _is_ very little of reliable public\r\nopinion amid cities. The American mind is styled fickle; so it may be in\r\nthe great marts. From _them_ come your sensations and spasms. The\r\ninterior is more stable, and less swayed by impulses. Aggregate a\r\nhundred county editorials all over the North, then strike an average,\r\nand you will find the product in the last big journal. The misfortune of\r\nWashington social life is that we walk in it over a circle. Hither come\r\n'needy knife-grinders,' and axe-sharpeners, and place-hunters, who say\r\nwhat they think will be agreeable to the ears of power. But the other\r\nkind of mails, presided over by Mr. Blair, bring us wholesome, although\r\nsometimes disagreeable, truths. They are worth attending to, Mr.\r\nPresident. Let us 'strike,' but let us 'hear.'\r\n\r\n_Mr. Seward._ In the matter of newspapers, my son Fred and I divide\r\nreading. He distils the metropolitan gazettes, and I those of England\r\nand France. Then we exchange commodities at breakfast time. Fred, having\r\nbeen an editor, can boil down the news very rapidly, and so put its\r\nessence into our coffee-pot. The foreign journals, however, have so much\r\nin them that is dissimulative and latent, they require more care and\r\ndiscernment. Mr. Hunter aids me in dissecting them.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Lincoln._ You are the son of an editor, Montgomery; how do you\r\nstand on this subject of Colfax's bill to carry all the papers in your\r\nmails? The rebel postmaster-general, in _his_ report, made, you\r\nremember, an elaborate argument to justify the Jeff Davis law, which\r\nforbids the sending of newspapers and periodicals by expressmen.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Blair._ When Colfax will accept as an amendment a prohibition of\r\ntelegrams, and the obliging our mails to transmit _all_ intelligence,\r\nthen I will consider of his views.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Smith._ Well said; as good an extract that from the last edition of\r\nBlair's rhetoric as could be wished for.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Chase._ Or in the Tribune satires of Horace! But let me ask Mr.\r\nBlair what he thinks of a newspaper tax.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Blair._ Very favorably. I am for a mill stamp on every paper,\r\nobliging every ten readers to pay the government one cent.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Stanton._ Mr. Secretary of the Interior, what is the average\r\ncirculation of newspapers in the loyal section?\r\n\r\n_Mr. Smith._ A thousand million.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Chase_ (rapidly computing). Which on Mr. Blair's proposition would\r\nyield a million dollars revenue.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Welles._ And support the government at our present rate of\r\nexpenditure _for one day!_\r\n\r\n_Mr. Seward._ The public would bear half a cent on each paper. The\r\npublisher could make his readers insensibly pay the tax, and improve\r\nboth paper and issue by receiving another half cent: and so add one cent\r\nof charge per copy.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Chase._ Which would yield a revenue of five millions per year.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Lincoln._ Would the people stand such a charge?\r\n\r\n_Mr. Stanton (good humoredly)._ Will our friend the Secretary of State\r\nsmoke fewer cigars when you come to tax tobacco?\r\n\r\n_Mr. Welles (naïvely)._ But newspaper reading is not a vice.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Bates._ Be not so sure of that. The passion for newspapers excites\r\nthe minds of the whole republic. Now-a-days your servant reads the news\r\nas he works. The clergy peruse the Sunday extras, and the\r\ncrossing-sweeper begs your worn-out copy instead of a cigar-stump.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Blair._ Yet Gen. McClellan has not read a newspaper in three\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Lincoln._ The subject brings to my mind a good old parson in\r\nSpringfield who used to complain that the _Weekly Republican_ was as bad\r\nas himself. He was preaching his old sermons over and over again with\r\nnew texts. Come to find out, he had a waggish grandson who for three\r\nprevious weeks had neatly gummed the fresh date over the old one, and\r\nthe dear divine had been perusing the same paper as many times.\r\n\r\n_(Omnes laughing heartily.)_\r\n\r\n_Mr. Stanton._ Talking of General McClellan,--I had my first engagement\r\nwith him last night at one o'clock.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Welles (startled)._ One o'clock! No wonder he has had typhoid\r\nfever.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Lincoln._ I think he is napping it now. He has a wonderful facility\r\nat the sleep business. Forty winks seem to refresh him as much as four\r\nhours do other people. At my last levee, according to the newspapers, he\r\nand his wife retired early. _He_ went up stairs and napped for two\r\nhours, desiring to see me for half an hour alone afterward. Then he\r\nspent several hours at the topographical bureau, hunting for some old\r\nmaps which he insisted had been there since the Creek campaign. He was\r\nrewarded for his industry by finding also an admirable map and survey of\r\nthe situation around New Orleans.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Seward._ The General is a believer in Robert Bruce's spider. The\r\nAmerican spider's-web didn't reach Richmond in July, nor Columbus in\r\nNovember, but McClellan has kept on busily spinning.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Blair._ Can any one tell me what is the General's platform?\r\n\r\n_Mr. Stanton._ I can. Long before I dreamed of being here, he told me.\r\nIt is in three words.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Lincoln._ That's the shortest I ever heard of next to that of the\r\nEnglish parson--'What _I_ say is orthodox, what I don't believe is\r\nheterodox.'\r\n\r\n_Mr. Smith._ But the three words?\r\n\r\n_Mr. Seward._ Cæsar's was in these words: _Veni, vidi, vici_.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Stanton._ It is to be fervently hoped _they_ will become the Latin\r\ntranslation of his own platform. McClellan's is, 'TO RETRIEVE BULL RUN!'\r\n\r\n_Mr. Lincoln (laughing)._ Then, if the General told you that, he is a\r\nplagiarist: for that is _my_ platform. When he was made commander here,\r\nhe asked me what I wanted done. Said I, 'Retrieve Bull Run.' He said he\r\nwould, and turned to go. I jocularly added, 'But can't you tell us how\r\nyou are going to do it?' He mused a moment, and then said, 'I must work\r\nit out algebraically, and from unknown quantities produce the certain\r\nresult. \"Drill\" shall be my \"_x_\" and \"Transportation\" my \"_y_\" and\r\n\"Patience\" my \"_z_.\" Then _x_ + _y_ + _z_ = success.' And now that Mr.\r\nStanton is here, I doubt not the slate is ready for the figuring.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Stanton._ Thank you, Mr. President, for the compliment. May it\r\nprove a simple equation.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Chase (with energy)._ Now we call for your platform, Mr. Secretary\r\nof War.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Stanton (gracefully bowing)._ The President's--yours--_ours\r\n(looking all around)_.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Seward._ But the allusion is a proper personal one, nevertheless.\r\nRemember court-martial law--the youngest always speaks first!\r\n\r\n(_Omnes compose themselves in a listening attitude._)\r\n\r\n_Mr. Stanton._ First and foremost, I believe slavery to be the _casus\r\nbelli_. To treat the _casus belli_ above and beyond all other\r\nconsiderations I hold to be the duty of the true commander-in-chief: as\r\nthe surgeon disregards secondary symptoms and probes the wound. I would\r\ntreat this _casus belli_ as the Constitution allows us to treat it--not\r\none hair's breadth from the grand old safeguard would I step. Under the\r\nConstitution I believe slavery to be a purely local institution. In\r\nLouisiana and Texas, a slave is an immovable by statute, and is annexed\r\nto the realty as hop-poles are in the law of New York. In Alabama and\r\nMississippi, the slave is a chattel. In the first-named States he passes\r\nby deed of national act and registration; in the other, by simple\r\nreceipt or delivery. Thus even among slave States there is no uniform\r\nsystem respecting the slave property. To the Northern States the slave\r\nis a person in his ballot relation to congressional quota and\r\nconstituency, and also an apprentice to labor, to be delivered up on\r\ndemand. The slave escaping from Maryland to Pennsylvania is not to be\r\ndelivered up, nor cared about, nor thought about, until he is demanded.\r\nLiberty is the law of nature. Every man is presumed free in choice, and\r\nnot even to be trammeled by apprenticeship, until the contrary is made\r\nclearly to appear. One man may be a New York discharged convict, for\r\ninstance--an unpardoned convict. He emigrates southward, he obtains\r\nproperty, according to local law, in a slave. The slave escapes to New\r\nYork. The convict--unpardoned--master enters the tribunal there on his\r\ndemand. Quoth the escaped apprentice, producing the record of the\r\nconviction, 'Mr. Claimant, you have no standing in court. Your civil\r\nrights are suspended in this State until you are pardoned. You are _not_\r\npardoned, therefore I will not answer aye or no to your claim, until you\r\nare legitimately in court, and recognized by the judges.' I take it that\r\nplea would avail. And if the crier wanted to employ a person to sweep\r\nthe court-room the next moment, he could employ that defendant to do it.\r\nThere is not a man in the rebel States (_whom we publicly know of_) who\r\nhas a standing under the Constitution regarding this slavery question.\r\nBy his own argument he lives in a foreign country; by our own argument\r\nhe is not _rectus in curia_. Were I an invading general and wanted\r\nhorses, I would decoy them from the rebels with hay and stable\r\nenticements. If I wanted trench-diggers, camp scullions, or\r\nartillerists, or pilots, or oarsmen, or guides, and, being that general,\r\nsaw negroes about me, I should press them into my service. Time enough\r\nto talk about the rights of some one to possess the negroes by better\r\nclaim of title to service when that somebody, with the Constitution in\r\none hand and stipulation of allegiance in the other, demands legal\r\npossession. Even the fugitive slave is emancipated practically whilst in\r\nOhio, and whilst not yet demanded. Rebel soldiers daily leave their\r\nplantations and abandon their negroes. _Pro tem_, at least, the latter\r\nare then emancipated. Let them, when within Our lines, continue\r\nemancipated.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Welles._ Would you arm them?\r\n\r\n_Mr. Stanton._ Yes, if exigencies of situation so demanded. The\r\nbeleaguered garrison at Lucknow armed every one about the place--natives\r\nor not, servants or masters. Did General Washington spare the whisky\r\nstills in the time of the insurrection in Western Virginia when they\r\nwere in his way? Yet the stills were universally agreed to be property,\r\nand were not taken by due process of law. Shall we fight a rebel in\r\nCharleston streets, and at the same time protect his negro by a guard in\r\nthe Charleston jail?\r\n\r\n_Mr. Blair._ But what instructions would you give to the soldiers about\r\nthis _casus belli_?\r\n\r\n_Mr. Stanton._ None at all. The soldier should know nothing about _casus\r\nbelli_. General Buell answered the correspondent well when he said, 'I\r\nknow nothing about the cause of this war. I am to fight the rebels and\r\nobey orders.' Cries a general to a subaltern--'Yonder smokes a\r\nbattery--go and take it.' Do we issue specific instructions to the\r\ntroops about the women, the children, the chickens, the forage, the\r\nmules-persons or property--whom they encounter? The circumstances and\r\nthe exigencies of the situation determine their conduct. A household\r\nmastiff who will pin a rebel by the throat when he passes his kennel,\r\nflying from pursuit, is just as serviceable as would prove a loyal\r\nbullet sped to the rebel's brain. I believe that the acknowledged fact,\r\nthe necessary fact, that wherever our army advances, emancipation\r\npractically ensues, will carry more terror to the slave-owner than any\r\nother warlike incident. But I would have them understand that this\r\nresult is not our design, but a necessity of _their_ rebellion.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Bates._ You are like the last witness upon the stand--subjected to\r\na vigorous cross-examination upon everything gone before. Have you ever\r\nthought what is to be the upshot of the contention?\r\n\r\n_Mr. Stanton._ Restoration of the Union!\r\n\r\n_Mr. Bates._ Aye, but how to be brought about? Are not the pride and the\r\nobstinacy growing stronger every day at the South?\r\n\r\n_Mr. Stanton._ 'Men are but children of a larger growth.' Who of us has\r\nnot conquered pride and obstinacy in the nursery? I have seen the boy of\r\na mild-tempered father fairly admire the parent when he broke the truce\r\nof affection and vigorously thrashed him. The large majority of the\r\nSouthern people have been educated to believe the men of the North\r\ncowardly, mean, and avaricious. Cowardly, because they persistently\r\nrefused the duel. Mean, because all classes worked, and there seemed\r\namong them no arrogance of birth. Avaricious, because they crouched to\r\nthe planters with calico and manufactures, or admired their bullying for\r\nthe sake of their cotton.\r\n\r\nAnd the great masses of the South have been and are learning how the\r\npresent leaders have duped them upon all these points. They have\r\ndiscovered we are not cowards. Every prisoner, from the chivalric\r\nCorcoran to the urchin drummer-boy at Richmond who spat on the sentinel,\r\nhas afforded proof of courage and fortitude, whilst thousands and\r\nthousands of people have secretly admired it. The very death vacancies\r\nat family boards throughout the plantations perpetually remind the\r\nSouthrons that _we are not_ cowards in fight. They have learned, too,\r\nthat we are neither mean nor avaricious, when the millionaire merchant,\r\nwhom they knew two years ago, cheerfully accepts the poor man's lot of\r\nto-day; or when they behold all classes without one murmur hear of a\r\nmillion dollars per day being spent on the war, and then _clamor to be\r\ntaxed_! If they perceive the negroes leaving them, they at once also\r\nperceive that in loyal Maryland, loyal Virginia, loyal Kentucky and\r\nloyal Missouri,--in Baltimore, St. Louis, and Louisville,--the slaves\r\nunder local laws are protected to their owners. Thus the most stupid\r\nwill reason, It is our own act which has placed in jeopardy this our\r\nproperty. With a restored Union, Georgia and Louisiana must be as\r\nMaryland and Kentucky continued even in the midst of camps. Who, during\r\nthe acme of the French revolution, could have believed that the people\r\nof Paris would so soon and so readily accept even despotism as the\r\npanacea of turmoil? Show a real grievance, and I grant you that\r\nrebellion achieves the dignity of revolution. Provide an imaginary or a\r\ncolored evil as the basis of insurrection, and even pride and obstinacy\r\nwill eventually comprehend the sophistry of the leaders.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Lincoln._ Seward's secret correspondence with Southern loyalists\r\nproves these things. Mr. Stanton must read that last letter from....\r\n\r\n_Mr. Stanton._ Indeed! You surprise me. Pray how could you receive\r\nintelligence from him?\r\n\r\n_Mr. Lincoln (opening a drawer)._ Do you see this button? I unscrew this\r\neye. The two discs now separate. Between them you can put a sheet of\r\nFrench letter paper. When the troops advanced to Bull Run, certain of\r\nthe soldiers were provided with such buttons. Various deserters have had\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Seward (laughing.)_ Who knows but General Scott's coachman had one\r\nor two?[M]\r\n\r\n_Mr. Stanton._ This practically corroborates my theories. If we in\r\nWashington find it so difficult to repress communication and spies, is\r\nit not fair to presume that in Richmond, Savannah, New Orleans and\r\nMemphis (where there is _real_ incentive from suffering and\r\npersecution), it is equally impossible to stop information? It was\r\nimpossible to procure it when the three rifled cannon at the Richmond\r\nfoundry were found spiked. It would prove serviceable to the patience of\r\nthe nation, could it only step behind the scenes and learn much--known\r\nto us--which it must ere long understand.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Mr. Lincoln._ I have just received by our secret mail a very affecting\r\nletter from Col. Corcoran. I will read an extract. [_Reads._]\r\n\r\n'Of my physical suffering I will not speak. If restored to friends and\r\nhome I shall, however, be a memorable example of the victory of mind\r\nover body. I determined to lay down my life for my country when I left\r\nthat home; and if it will serve the cause, as I have repeatedly told the\r\npeople here, to hang, or draw, or quarter me, I am ready for the\r\nsacrifice. But there are hundreds among the prisoners whose minds are\r\nnot so buoyant as mine, who do suffer terribly. Can not some means be\r\ndevised to clothe and feed _them_, or to exchange for them?'\r\n\r\n_Mr. Blair._ A patriot soul. The clerkship left in the New York\r\npost-office when the Colonel departed for the war has been retained for\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Lincoln (quickly)._ Ah! _that_ heroic sufferer shall have something\r\nbetter than a clerkship if he ever returns.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Stanton._ I have thought much of this exchange of prisoners and\r\ncaptivity amelioration. When the insurrection was inchoate, we could\r\nafford to be punctilious. But its present gigantic proportions surely\r\naffect the question (so to term it) of ransom. When our countrymen were\r\nin the Algerine prisons we took means to treat for them. What say you,\r\ngentlemen, against sending commissioners to Richmond for the purpose of\r\nsupervising the medicines, clothing, food and exchange of our prisoners?\r\n\r\n_Mr. Seward._ That may only be conceded by accepting commissioners for a\r\nsimilar purpose from the rebel government.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Chase._ Our plans are now so perfectly matured that even the danger\r\nof spies recedes. I am in favor of Mr. Stanton's proposition.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Lincoln._ I think you can try it. There are so many prisoners, from\r\nall parts of the country, that public sentiment must uphold the measure.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Smith._ Mr. Secretary of State, you were taking notes whilst Mr.\r\nStanton was giving his views upon the restoration question. Were they on\r\nthat subject?\r\n\r\n_Mr. Seward._ Yes. Some fleeting thoughts occurred to me which I was\r\ndesirous of preserving for to-morrow. _I_ have a great deal of faith in\r\nestablishing Southern 'doughfacery.'\r\n\r\n_Mr. Welles._ Doughfacery?\r\n\r\n_Mr. Seward._ Yes: that supremacy of pocket over pride which so long\r\nafflicted the North. Above and beyond the slave-owners must rise the\r\ngreat class of manufacturers and merchants,--almost every third man of\r\nNorthern origin, too,--whose pocket is the great sufferer, and without\r\nwhose property, hereafter, plantations can not prosper. Given a decent\r\npretext for adjustment, when pride will go to the wall. Once allow the\r\nmasses to grasp the reins, and the slave-owners will be driven to the\r\nwall-side of the political highway also. This I call Southern\r\ndoughfacery for the sake of a phrase well understood.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Blair._ Then your old plan of the great national convention comes\r\nin vogue?\r\n\r\n_Mr. Lincoln._ _My_ plan! (_Good humoredly._) You must not _all_ steal\r\nmy thunder. By the way, Seward, your pleasant friend Judge D----, who\r\ncame from New York about Col. Corcoran, told me the meaning of that\r\nphrase. It seems a Dublin stage manager got up a scenic play with\r\nthunder in it perfectly imitated by a diapason of bass drums. A rival\r\ngot up another scenic play, to which, out of jealous _pique_, the\r\ninventor repaired as a spectator. To his surprise he heard his own\r\ninvention from behind the scenes. He instantly exclaimed aloud, 'The\r\nrascal, he's stolen my thunder!'\r\n\r\n_Mr. Seward (jocularly)._ The President finds a parallel between a\r\nnational convention and thunder. Well, well, the clearest atmosphere is\r\nbreathed after the clouds culminate in thunder and lightning. I accept\r\nthe application.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Chase._ But if the South is to surrender pride, what are _we_ to\r\nsurrender?\r\n\r\n_Mr. Seward (quickly)._ _Political_ pride. The battle of freedom was\r\nfought and won when the Inaugural was pronounced. The South can not\r\nrecover from the present stagnation in a quarter-century, by which time\r\nit will again have accepted contentedly the original belief that\r\nslavery, like one of the lotteries of Georgia, or one of the red-dog\r\nbanks of Arkansas, is a purely local institution.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Stanton._ I heartily accept the project of a national convention.\r\nBut I am against any agitation or committal to leading ideas which are\r\nto control it. One convention ruined France, and another saved it. We\r\ncan better obtain consent of North and South to holding a convention by\r\nforbearance from discussing its probable platform. Let it meet. No fear\r\nbut it will elucidate _some_ satisfactory result.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Welles._ You have just discussed this question of war. I wish\r\nsomething could be done to settle this affair of privateering. To my\r\nreflection it appears to embrace a very important consideration of\r\n'policy' as well as of law. A man does not always punish his embezzling\r\nclerk because the law gives him authority to do so. The ocean rebel who\r\nto-day captures our transports laden with soldiers, may to-morrow put\r\noff twenty boats in the Potomac, and capture our men on the river\r\nschooner. The Attorney General's opinion and the law of Judge Kelson in\r\nNew York hang the former; but military law will exchange the latter\r\nwhenever a satisfactory opportunity presents itself.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Lincoln._ The policy question has become a grave one. I have been\r\nmuch struck by the letter of Judge Daly, of New York, to Senator\r\nHarris--a most opportune, learned, and temperate paper.\r\n\r\n[_Enter an attendant._]\r\n\r\n_Mr. Lincoln._ Gen. McClellan is at the door. Invite him in.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Stanton._ By all means. He is 'the very head and front of our\r\noffending.'\r\n\r\n[_Enter Gen. McClellan._]\r\n\r\n_Gen. McC._ Good evening, Mr. President and Cabinet. (_Speaking rapidly\r\nand brusquely._) The bridge equipages are now entirely complete. Here is\r\na dispatch acknowledging the receipt of the last supply. With February\r\nis ushered in the Southern spring, which, as you all know, _must_ end\r\n'this winter of our discontent.' The Western V now is perfect from Cairo\r\nand Harper's Ferry at the top to Cumberland Gap at the bottom. It is the\r\nfirst letter in Victory.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Lincoln._ When the General becomes oratorical, then indeed has he\r\ngood news.\r\n\r\n_Gen. McC._ I have, sir; but, with great respect to all these our\r\nfriends, it must be for your own ears, to-night at least.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Lincoln (rising)._ We will withdraw to the library. Gentlemen, pray\r\ncome to some understanding during our absence respecting the reply to be\r\nsent to M. Thouvenel's extraordinary secret dispatch. I will rejoin you\r\nin--\r\n\r\n_Gen, McC._ Seven minutes, Mr. President--those are all I can spare.\r\nGood evening, gentlemen.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLITERARY NOTICES.\r\n\r\n\r\nBORDER LINES OF KNOWLEDGE IN SOME PROVINCES OF MEDICAL SCIENCE. An\r\nIntroductory Lecture delivered before the Medical Class of Harvard\r\nUniversity, Nov. 6, 1861. By Oliver Wendell Holmes, M.D., Parkman\r\nProfessor of Anatomy and Physiology. Boston: Ticknor & Fields. 1861.\r\n\r\nIt is a pleasant thing to realize, in reading a work like this, how\r\nperfectly GENIUS is capable of rendering deeply interesting to the most\r\ngeneral reader topics which in the hands of mere _talent_ become\r\nintolerably 'professional' and dry. The mind which has once flowed\r\nthrough the golden land of poetry becomes, indeed, like the brook of\r\nScottish story, more or less alchemizing,--communicating an aureate hue\r\neven to the wool of the sheep which it washes, and turning all its fish\r\ninto 'John Dorées.' And in doing this, far from injuring the practical\r\nand market value of either, it positively improves them. For genius is\r\nalways general and human, and rises intuitively above conventional\r\npoetry and conventional science, to that higher region where fact and\r\nfancy become identified in truth. And such is the characteristic of the\r\nlecture before us, in which solid, nutritive learning loses none of its\r\nalimentary value for being cooked with all the skill of a _Ude_ or of a\r\n_Francatelli_. Many passages in the work illustrate this power of\r\næsthetic illustration in a truly striking manner.\r\n\r\n    In certain points of view, human anatomy may be considered an\r\n    almost exhausted science. From time to time some small organ,\r\n    which had escaped earlier observers, has been pointed out,--such\r\n    parts as the _tensor tarsi_, the otic ganglion, or the Pacinian\r\n    bodies; but some of the best anatomical works are those which have\r\n    been classic for many generations. The plates of the bones of\r\n    Vesalius, three centuries old, are still masterpieces of accuracy,\r\n    as of art. The magnificent work of Albinus on the muscles,\r\n    published in 1747, is still supreme in its department, as the\r\n    constant references of the most thorough recent treatise on the\r\n    subject--that of Theile--sufficiently show. More has been done in\r\n    unravelling the mysteries of the faciæ, but there has been a\r\n    tendency to overdo this kind of material analysis. Alexander\r\n    Thompson split them up into cobwebs, as you may see in the plates\r\n    to Velpeau's Surgical Anatomy. I well remember how he used to\r\n    shake his head over the coarse work of Scarpa and Astley\r\n    Cooper;--_as if Denner, who painted the separate hairs of the head\r\n    and pores of the skin, in his portraits, had spoken lightly of the\r\n    pictures of Rubens and Vandyck_.\r\n\r\nLaymen can not decide, where doctors disagree; but there are few who\r\nwill not at least read this lecture with pleasure.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN BRENT. By Major Theodore Winthrop.\r\nBoston: Ticknor & Fields. 1862.\r\n\r\nIt is strange that so soon after the appearance of _Tom Tiddler's\r\nGround_, with its one good story of a wild gallop over the Plains, a\r\nnovel should have appeared in which the same scenes are reproduced,--the\r\nwhole full of wild-fire and gallop.--American life-fever and\r\nprairie-dust,--uneasy contrasts of the feelings of gentlemen and\r\nmemories of _salons_ with pork-frying, hickory shirts, and whisky. The\r\nexcitement and movement of _John Brent_ are wonderful. Had the author\r\nbeen an artist, we should have had in him an American Correggio,--with\r\nstrong lights and shadows, bright colors, figures of desperadoes\r\ninspired with the air of gentlemen, and gentlemen, real or false, who\r\nplay their parts in no mild scenes. It is the first good novel which has\r\ngiven us a picture of the West since California and Mormondom added to\r\nit such vivid and extraordinary coloring, and since the 'ungodly\r\nPike'--that 'rough' of the wilderness--has taken the place of the\r\nwell-nigh traditional frontiersman. It is entertaining and exciting, and\r\nwill attain a very great popularity, having in it all the elements to\r\nsecure such success. Those who recognized in _Cecil Dreeme_ the\r\nvividly-photographed scenes and characters of New York, will be pleased\r\nto find the same talent employed on a wider field, among more vigorous\r\nnatures, and assuming a far more active development. Never have we felt\r\nmore keenly regret at the untimely decease of an author than for\r\nWINTHROP, while perusing the pages of _John Brent_. There went out a\r\nlight which _might_ have shown, in Rembrandt shadows and gleams, the\r\nmost striking scenes of this country and this age.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMOIR, LETTERS AND REMAINS OF ALEXIS DE TOCQUEVILLE. Translated from\r\nthe French, by the Translator of Napoleon's Correspondence with King\r\nJoseph. In two volumes. Boston: Ticknor & Fields. 1862.\r\n\r\nNo French writer enjoys a more truly enviable popularity in America than\r\nM. DE TOCQUEVILLE. That he should have discussed the vital principles of\r\nour political and social life, in a manner which not only made him no\r\nenemies among us, but established his 'Democracy' as a classic\r\nreference, is as wonderful as it was well deserved. The present work is,\r\nhowever, a delightful one by itself, and will be read with a relish. We\r\nsympathize with the translator (a most capable one by the way) when he\r\ndeclares that he leaves his task with regret, fearing lest he never\r\nagain may have an opportunity of associating so long and so intimately\r\nwith such a mind. The typography and paper are of superior quality.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOEMS BY WILLIAM ALLINGHAM. ('Blue and gold.') First American Edition.\r\nBoston: Ticknor & Fields.\r\n\r\n'Fresh, beautiful, and winsome.'--Among the living poets of England\r\nthere may be many who are popularly regarded as 'greater,' but certainly\r\nthere is none more unaffectedly natural or simply delightful than\r\nWILLIAM ALLINGHAM. We are pleased at his probably unconscious Irish-isms\r\nin his humbler lyrics, which have deservedly attained the proud eminence\r\nof veritable 'Folk-songs' in the mouths of the people, and are touched\r\nby the exquisite music, the tender feeling, and the beautiful picturing\r\nwhich we find inspiring his lays. It requires but little knowledge of\r\nthem to be impressed with the evident love of his art with which our\r\nIrish bard is filled. It would be difficult to find in the same number\r\nof songs by any contemporary so little evident effort allied to such\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHURCH MONTHLY. Edited by Rev. George M. Randall, D.D., and Rev.\r\nF.D. Huntington, D.D. Vol. II. No. 6. Boston: E.P. Dutton & Co. 1861.\r\n\r\nThis beautiful and scholarly magazine, which abounds in 'the elegant\r\nexpression of sound learning,' contains, in the present number, a noble\r\narticle on _Loyalty in the United States_, by Rev. B.B. BABBITT, which\r\nwe would gladly have read by every one. Almost amusing, and yet really\r\nbeautiful, is the following Latin version of 'Now I lay me down to\r\nsleep,' by Rev. EDWARD BALLARD.\r\n\r\n  _In Canabulis_.\r\n\r\n  'Nunc recline ut dormirem,\r\n    Precor te, O Domine,\r\n  Ut defendas animam;\r\n  Ante diem si obirem,\r\n    Precor te, O Domine,\r\n  Us servares animam.\r\n    Hoc que precor pro Iesu!'\r\n\r\n\r\nWORKS OF BAYARD TAYLOR. Vols. I. & II.\r\nNew York: G.P. Putnam.\r\n\r\nBAYARD TAYLOR has the pleasant art of communicating personal experiences\r\nin a personal way. It is not an unknown X, an invisible essence of\r\ncriticism, which travels for us in his sketches, but a veritable\r\ntraveler, speaking, Irving-like, of what he sees, so that we see and\r\nfeel with him. In these volumes, the ups and downs, the poverties and\r\neven the ignorances of the young traveler are set forth--not\r\nparaded--with great vividness, and we come to the end of each chapter as\r\nif it were the scene of a good old-fashioned comedy. CORYATT without his\r\ncrudities, if we can imagine such a thing, suggests himself, with\r\nalternations of 'HERODOTUS his gossip' without his craving credulity.\r\nPerhaps these volumes explain more than any of their predecessors the\r\ncauses of TAYLOR'S popularity, and like them will do good work in\r\nstimulating that love of travel which with many becomes the absorbing\r\npassion sung by MULLER,--'_Wandern! ach! Wandern!_'\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS HOOD'S WORKS. Edited by Epes\r\nSargent. New York: G.P.

It contains Hood's Poems,\r\nnever made more attractively readable than in this edition. As a gift it\r\nwould be difficult to find a work which would be more generally\r\nacceptable to either old or young.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATIONAL MILITARY SERIES. Part First.\r\nBy Captain W.W. Van Ness. New York:\r\nCarleton, 413 Broadway.\r\n\r\nA neat little work on military tactics, conforming to the army\r\nregulations adopted and approved by the War Department of the United\r\nStates. It is thoroughly practical, 'being arranged on the plainest\r\npossible principle of question and answer,' and being within the reach\r\nof the dullest capacity, and thoroughly comprehensive of all required of\r\nthe soldier, will probably become, as its author trusts, 'a standard\r\nmilitary work.'\r\n\r\n\r\nFORT LAFAYETTE; OR, LOVE AND SECESSION.\r\nBy Benjamin Wood. New York:\r\nCarleton, 413 Broadway. 1862.\r\n\r\nEven while a tree is being blown down by the hurricane, small fungi or\r\nother minute vegetation spring up in its rifts; every social shock of\r\nthe day is promptly scened and 'tagged' at the minor theatres; and shall\r\nthis war escape its novels? Mr. WOOD votes in the negative, and supplies\r\nus with a somewhat sensational yet not badly manufactured article,\r\nwhich, like the melo-dramas referred to, will be received with delight\r\nby a certain line of patrons, and, we presume, be also relished. It is a\r\nfirst-rate specimen of a second-rate romance.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEROES AND MARTYRS: Notable Men of the Time. With Portraits on Steel.\r\nNew York: G.P. Putnam, 532 Broadway. C.T.

The portraits of Commodore S.F. DUPONT and Major THEODORE\r\nWINTHROP, in this first number, are excellent; while the literary\r\nportion, devoted to WINFIELD SCOTT, deserves praise.

Government\r\nat present holds the winning cards,--if they are only skillfully played\r\nthe game is its own. It is impossible to study the map and the present\r\nposition of our forces with our resources, and not realize this. 'Hemmed\r\nin!' is the despairing cry from Southern journals, which but the other\r\nday insolently threatened to transfer the war to Northern soil, and to\r\nsack New York and Philadelphia; and, with their proverbial fickleness\r\nand fire, we find many of them half rebelling against the management of\r\nMr. JEFFERSON DAVIS and his coadjutors.\r\n\r\nThis is all encouraging. On the other hand, we are beginning to feel\r\nmore acutely the miseries of war, and its enormous cost. The time is at\r\nhand when the whole country will be called on to show its heroism by\r\npatient endurance of many trials, and by _living_ as well as dying for\r\nthe great cause of liberty and Union. Let it all be done patiently and\r\nwithout a murmur. Every suffering will be repaid tenfold in the hour of\r\ntriumph. Let it be remembered that as we suffer our chances of victory\r\nincrease, and that every pain felt by us is a death-pang to the foe.\r\nNow, if ever, the Northern quality of stubborn endurance must show\r\nitself. We, too, can suffer as heroically as the South boasts of doing.\r\nIt is this which in the course of events must inevitably give us the\r\nvictory, for no spirit of chivalry, no enthusiasm, can ultimately resist\r\nsturdy Saxon pluck. The South, foolishly enough, has vaunted that it is\r\ninspired by the blood and temper of the Latin races of Southern Europe,\r\nand it can not be denied that their climate has given them the\r\nimpulsiveness of their ideal heroes. In this fiery impatience lies the\r\nelement which renders them incapable of sustaining defeat, and which,\r\nafter any disaster, must stimulate dissension among them.\r\n\r\nIt should also be borne in mind that the most direct causes of our\r\nsufferings all involve very practical benefits. The Southern press\r\ntaunts our soldiers with enlisting for pay. Let us admit that vast\r\nnumbers have truly been partially induced by the want of employment at\r\nhome to enter the army. It is a peculiar characteristic of all Northern\r\nblood that it can and does combine intelligence and interest with the\r\nstrongest enthusiasm. No man was ever made a worse soldier by being\r\nprudent, any more than by being a religious Christian. Taunts and jeers\r\ncan not affect the truth. The Protestant mechanic soldiery of Germany\r\nduring the wars of the Reformation, the men of Holland, and the Puritans\r\nof England, were all reviled for the same cause--but they conquered. God\r\nnever punishes men for common-sense, nor did it ever yet blind zeal,\r\nthough it may prevent zeal from degenerating into sheer madness. The\r\nwar, while it has crippled industry, has also kept it alive,--it has\r\nbecome a great industrial central force, giving work to millions. Again,\r\nin the creation of a debt we shall find such a stimulus to industry as\r\nwe never before knew. Taxation, which kills a weak country crippled by\r\nfeudal laws and nightmared by an extravagant court and nobility, simply\r\ninduces fresh and vigorous effort to make additional profits in a land\r\nof endless resources and of vast territory, where every man is free to\r\nwork at what he chooses. Taxation may come before us like a raging lion,\r\nbut, in the words of BEECHER, we shall find honey in the carcass. Let us\r\nonly cheerfully make the best of everything, and uphold the\r\nadministration and the war with a right good will, and we shall learn as\r\nwe never did before the extent of the incredible elasticity and\r\nrecuperative power of the American.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the present war will have a beneficial result in\r\nmaking us acquainted with the real nature of this arrogant and peculiar\r\nSouth-land. It was said that the Crimean struggle did much good by\r\ndispelling the cloudy hobgoblin mystery which hung over Russia, and,\r\nwhile it destroyed its prestige as a bugbear, more than compensated for\r\nthis, by giving it a proper place abreast of civilized nations in the\r\ngreat march of industry and progress. Just so we are learning that the\r\nSouth is perfectly capable of receiving white labor, that it is not\r\nstrangely and peculiarly different from the rest of the cis-tropical\r\nregions, that the negro is no more its necessity than he is to Spain or\r\nItaly, and that, in short, white labor may march in, undisturbed, so\r\nsoon as industry ceases to be regarded as disgraceful in it. We have\r\nlearned the vital necessity of union and identity of feeling between all\r\nthe States, and found out the folly of suffering petty local state\r\nattachments to blind us to the glory of citizenship in a nation, which\r\nshould cover a continent. We have learned what the boasted philanthropy\r\nof England is worth when put to the test of sacrifice, and also how the\r\nBritish lion can put forth the sharpest and most venomous of feline\r\nclaws when an opportunity presents itself of ruining a possible rival.\r\nMore than this, we have learned to be self-reliant, to take greater and\r\nmore elevated views of political duty, and to be heroic without being\r\nextravagant. Since we were a republic no one year has witnessed such\r\nnational and social progress among us as the past. We have had severe\r\nstruggles, and we have surmounted them; we have had hard lessons, and we\r\nhave learned them; we have had trials of pride, and we have profited by\r\nthem. And as we contend for principles based in reason and humanity and\r\nconfirmed by history, it follows that we must inevitably come forth\r\ngloriously triumphant, if we but bravely persevere in enforcing those\r\nprinciples.\r\n\r\nThe large amount of political information regarding the South and its\r\nresources which has been of late widely disseminated in the North, is a\r\nstriking proof that, disguise the question as we will, the extension of\r\nfree labor is, from a politico-economical point of view (which is, in\r\nfact, the only sound one), the real, or at least ultimate basis of this\r\nstruggle. The matter in hand is the restitution of the Union, laying\r\neverything else aside; but the great fact, which will not step aside, is\r\nthe consideration whether ten white men or one negro are to occupy a\r\ncertain amount of soil. There is no evading this finality, there is no\r\nimpropriety in its discussion, and it SHALL be discussed, so long as\r\nfree speech or a free pen is left in the North. So far from interfering\r\nwith the war, it is a stimulus to the thousands of soldiers who hope\r\neventually to settle in the South in districts where their labor will\r\nnot be compared with that of 'slaves,' and it is right and fit that they\r\nshould anticipate the great and inevitable truth in all its relations to\r\ntheir own welfare and that of the country.\r\n\r\nWe cheerfully agree with those who try with so much energy that\r\nEmancipation is not the matter in hand, and quite as cheerfully assent\r\nwhen they insist that the enemy, and not the negro, demands all our\r\npresent energy. But this has nothing to do with the great question,\r\nwhether slavery is or is not to ultimately remain as a great barrier to\r\nfree labor in regions where free labor is clamoring for admission. That\r\nis all we ask, nothing more. The instant the North and West are assured\r\nthat at some time, though remote, and by any means or encouragements\r\nwhatever, which expediency may dictate, the great cause of secession and\r\nsedition--will be removed from our land, then there will be witnessed an\r\nenthusiasm compared to which that of the South will be but lukewarm.\r\nThat this will be done, no rational person now doubts, or that\r\ngovernment will cheerfully act on it so soon as the fortunes of war or\r\nthe united voice of the people strengthen it in the good work. And until\r\nit _is_ done, let every intelligent freeman bear it in mind, thinking\r\nintelligently and acting earnestly, so that the great work may be\r\nadvanced rapidly and carried out profitably and triumphantly.\r\n\r\nThe leading minds of the South, shrewder than our Northern\r\nanti-emancipation half traitors and whole dough-faces, foreseeing the\r\ninevitable success of ultimate emancipation, have given many signs of\r\nwillingness to employ even it, if needs must be, as a means of\r\neffectually achieving their 'independence.' They have baited their hooks\r\nwith it to fish for European aid--they have threatened it armed, as a\r\nlast resort of desperation, if conquered by the North. Knowing as well\r\nas we that the days of slavery are numbered, they have used it as a\r\npretense for separation, they would just as willingly destroy it to\r\nmaintain that separation. Since the war began, projects of home\r\nmanufactures, and other schemes involving the encouragement of free\r\nlabor, have been largely discussed in the South,--and yet in spite of\r\nthis, thousands among us violently oppose Emancipation. In plain,\r\ntruthful words they uphold the ostensible platform of the enemy, and yet\r\navow themselves friends of the Union.\r\n\r\nWe have said it before, we repeat it: we ask for no undue haste, no\r\nunwise measures, nothing calculated to irritate or disorganize or impede\r\nthe measures which government may now have in hand. But we hold firmly\r\nthat Emancipation be calmly regarded as a measure which _must_ at some\r\ntime be fully carried out. Be it limited for the time, or for years, to\r\nthe Border States, be it assumed partially or entirely under the\r\nmodified form of apprenticeship, be it proclaimed only in Texas or South\r\nCarolina, it has in some way a claim to recognition, and _must_ be\r\nrecognized. Its friends are too many to be ignored in the day of\r\nsettlement.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is proper that every detail of contract corruption should be brought\r\nfully to light, and the country owes a debt of gratitude to Mr. DAWES\r\nfor his manly attack on the wretches who have crippled the war, robbed\r\nthe soldier, swindled the tax-payers, and aided the enemy by their\r\nwicked rapacity. Let it be remembered that whatever his sentiments may\r\nhave been, every man who has been instrumental, directly or indirectly,\r\nin cheating the treasury and the my during this period of distress, has\r\nbeen one of its enemies, and far more deadly than if he had been openly\r\nenlisted under the banners of JEFFERSON DAVIS. Were we anything but the\r\nbest-natured and most enduring public in the world, such revelations as\r\nhave by the been made would long since have driven these rapacious\r\ntraitors beyond sea or into the congenial Dixie for which they have\r\nindirectly labored.\r\n\r\nWe have been accustomed to read much since infancy of the sufferings of\r\nour army during the Revolution,--how they were hatless, ragged, starved,\r\nand badly armed. We have shuddered at the pictures of the snow at Valley\r\nForge, tracked by the blood from the feet of shoeless soldiers. Yet, in\r\nthe year 1861, with abundant means and with all the sympathy and aid of\r\na wealthy country, there has been more suffering in the army than the\r\nRevolution witnessed, and it was due in a great measure to men who\r\nhastened to the spoil like vultures to their prey. If the army has not\r\nin advanced, if proper weapons are not even yet ready, let the reader\r\nreflect how much the army is still crippled owing to imperfect supplies,\r\nand have patience.\r\n\r\nIt is not the soldier alone who has been robbed by the contractor. The\r\nmanufacturer who sees only a government order between himself and\r\nfailure, and who is willing to do anything to keep his operatives\r\nemployed, is asked to supply inferior goods at a low price. He may take\r\nthe order or leave it,--if he will not, another will,--and with it is\r\nexpected to take the risk of a return. When a man sees ruin before him,\r\nhe will often yield to such temptations. The contractor takes the goods,\r\nsells them if he can, and pockets the profits, sometimes ten times over\r\nwhat the manufacturer gains. He thereby robs outright, not only the\r\nsoldier, but also the operatives who make the goods, since the\r\nmanufacturer must reduce their wages to the lowest living point, in\r\norder to save himself.\r\n\r\nIt will all come to light. There is a discovery of all evil, and there\r\nis a grace which money cannot remove, neither from the thief nor from\r\nhis children. And we rejoice to see that so much is being made known,\r\nand that in all probability the public will be fully informed as to who\r\nwere principally guilty in these enormous and treasonable corruptions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is stated, on good authority, that the only objection urged by the\r\nPresident to adopting the policy of Emancipation, is the danger which\r\nwould be thereby incurred of effectually losing the allegiance of the\r\nloyal slave-holders in Tennessee, Kentucky, and Missouri.\r\n\r\nThe obvious answer to this is, that by paying these loyal slave-holders\r\nfor their chattels they could not fail to become firmer friends than\r\never. When we reflect on the extremely precarious tenure of all such\r\nproperty on the Border it becomes apparent that the man must be a\r\nlunatic indeed to hope for the permanency of the institution in the\r\ntobacco States. Since the war began nearly the two-thirds of the slaves\r\nin Missouri have changed their _habitat_,--about one-half of the number\r\nhaving been 'sold South,' while the other moiety have traveled North,\r\nwithout reference to ownership.\r\n\r\nThe administration need be under no apprehension as to the popularity of\r\nthis measure. It would be hailed with joy by millions. The capitalists\r\nof our Northern cities, who now await with impatience some indications\r\nof A REGULAR POLICY, will welcome with enthusiasm a proposition which\r\nwould at once render the debatable land no longer debatable, and which\r\nwould effectually disorganize the entire South, by rendering numbers\r\ndesirous of selling their slaves in order to secure what must sooner or\r\nlater be irrecoverably lost. If government has a policy in this matter,\r\nit is time that the public were informed of it. The public is ready to\r\nbe taxed to any extent, it is making tremendous sacrifices; all that it\r\nasks in return is some nucleus around which it may gather,--a settled\r\nprinciple by which its victories in war may be made to form the basis of\r\na permanent peace.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe English press, statesmen and orators have been pleased to regard our\r\ndemocratic government as a failure.\r\n\r\nBut we have at least one advantage. When an enormous wrong is\r\nperpetrated on the people by a secretary, _he can be hustled out of the\r\nway_, and the accomplices be punished.\r\n\r\nIn England we have seen of late the most enormous political and social\r\noutrage of the century coolly committed, without the slightest regard to\r\nconsequences, and without the slightest fear of any punishment whatever.\r\n\r\nThe truth has come to light, and every investigation, in the opinion of\r\nthe ablest and most sagacious men, confirms the assertion that the late\r\nMASON and SLIDELL difficulty was simply an immense stock-jobbing\r\nswindle, played in the most heartless manner on this country and on\r\nEngland, without heed as to the terrible consequences.\r\n\r\nThe London _Times_, as is well known, is the organ of the ROTHSCHILDS.\r\nDuring the late iniquitous war-flurry it acted perfectly in concert with\r\nLord PALMERSTON. While that gentleman kept back _for three weeks_\r\ndispatches, which, if published, would have had the immediate effect of\r\nestablishing a peaceful feeling, his Hebrew accomplices bought literally\r\nright and left of securities of every kind. Grand pickings they had;\r\neverything had tumbled down. England was roused by the _Times_ to a\r\nfury; a feeling of fierce injury was excited in this country, which an\r\nage will not now allay; and right in the midst of this, when one word\r\nmight have changed the whole, the official ministerial organ _explicitly\r\ndenied the existence of those 'peace' dispatches_ which have since come\r\nto light!\r\n\r\nLet us anticipate some of the results of this precious\r\nPalmerston-Hebrew-_Times_ swindle.\r\n\r\nIt has cost England twenty millions of dollars.\r\n\r\nIt has aroused such a feeling in this country against England as no one\r\ncan remember.\r\n\r\nIt has effectually killed the American market for English goods, and put\r\nthe tariff up to prohibition _en permanence_.\r\n\r\nIt has, by doing this, struck the most deadly blow at English prosperity\r\nwhich history has ever witnessed; for all that was needed to stimulate\r\nAmerican industry up to the pitch of competing with England in foreign\r\nmarkets was such a prohibitory tariff as would compel us to manufacture\r\nfor ourselves what we formerly bought.\r\n\r\nWho will say now that a republic does not work as well as a monarchy?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have read with pleasure a recently written and extensively\r\nrepublished article by SINCLAIR TOUSEY, of New York, condemnatory of the\r\nproposed stamp tax, and in which we most cordially concur; not because\r\nit is a tax materially affecting the interests of publishers, but\r\nbecause, as Mr. TOUSEY asserts, the diffusion of knowledge among the\r\npeople is a powerful element of strength _in government itself_. In\r\nthese times, it is essential, far more than during peace, that the\r\nnewspaper should circulate very freely, stimulating the public, aiding\r\ngovernment and the war, and keeping the mind of the country in living\r\nunion. Nothing would more rapidly produce a torpor--and there is too\r\nmuch torpor now--than a measure which would have the effect of killing\r\noff perhaps one half of the country press, the great mass of which is\r\nbarely able to live as it is. 'Let the press be as free as possible. Let\r\nit be free from onerous taxation, and left unfettered by special duties\r\nto do its just work.' This is a war for freedom, and the test of freedom\r\nis a free press.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe are indebted to a valued correspondent in Illinois for the following\r\ncommunication, setting forth the state of affairs in Southern Missouri\r\nduring the past summer. Few of our readers are ignorant that since that\r\ntime the region in question has been 'harried and shorn' even to\r\ndesolation by the brigands of Secessia.\r\n\r\n    In conversing lately with Dr. R., who fled for his life, last\r\n    July, from Ripley County, Southern Missouri, I collected some\r\n    information which may not be unacceptable to your readers.\r\n\r\n    Dr. R. states that early last summer the citizens of Southern\r\n    Missouri began gathering into companies of armed men opposed to\r\n    the general government, and that it was a fear that the general\r\n    government would not protect their lives and property which\r\n    induced great numbers of really Union men to take sides with the\r\n    rebels. They saw their country thronging with secession soldiers;\r\n    were told it was the will of the State government that they enlist\r\n    for the protection of the State: if they did not do this\r\n    voluntarily, they would be drafted; and all drafted ones would in\r\n    camp take a subordinate position, have to perform the cooking and\r\n    washing, in short, all the drudgery for those who volunteered.\r\n    This falsehood drove hundreds of the ignorant Missourians into the\r\n    rebel ranks. Captain LOWE, afterwards Col. LOWE, who was killed at\r\n    the battle of Fredericktown, was the recruiting officer in Ripley\r\n    and its adjoining counties. He arrested Dr. R. on the 4th of July,\r\n    on a charge of expressing sentiments 'dangerous to the welfare of\r\n    the community.' Dr. R. was tried by a court-martial, in presence\r\n    of the three hundred soldiers then assembled. Witnesses against\r\n    the Doctor were produced, but he was not allowed time to summon\r\n    witnesses in his behalf, nor to procure counsel. One novel\r\n    circumstance in the trial was occasioned by the absence of any\r\n    justice of the peace to administer the usual oath to the\r\n    witnesses. None were procurable, from the fact that all had\r\n    resigned, refusing to act officially under a government they had\r\n    repudiated. In this dilemma the prisoner came to their relief.\r\n    'Gentlemen, I am a justice of the peace, as most of you already\r\n    know, and, as I have not yet resigned, I will swear in the\r\n    witnesses for you.' 'Wall, I reckon he kin act as justice afore\r\n    he's convicted,' suggested one of the crowd. So the Doctor\r\n    administered the oath in the usual solemn manner. This\r\n    self-possession and fearlessness seemed to have an effect on his\r\n    judges, for, after the testimony, he was permitted to\r\n    cross-question the witnesses and plead his own cause. He was able\r\n    to neutralize some of the charges against him. The jury, after an\r\n    absence of fifteen minutes, returned verdict that 'as there was\r\n    nothing proved against the prisoner which would make him dangerous\r\n    to the community, he was permitted to be discharged. But,' added\r\n    the foreman, 'I am instructed by the committee to say they believe\r\n    Dr. R. to be a Black Republican, and to tell him that if he wants\r\n    to utter Black Republican sentiments, he has got to go somewhere\r\n    else to do it.' It was well known the Doctor had voted for\r\n    DOUGLAS. But here followed an animated conversation between the\r\n    prisoner and LOWE'S men as to what constituted Black\r\n    Republicanism; the result of which was, as the Doctor turned to\r\n    depart, Captain LOWE informed him he was re-arrested!\r\n\r\n    By the influence of some of the soldiers, the prisoner succeeded\r\n    next day in effecting his escape. Traveling by night and\r\n    concealing himself by day, he finally reached the federal lines in\r\n    safety. His family were not permitted to follow him, and did not\r\n    succeed in eluding the vigilance of their enemies and joining him\r\n    until the middle of January. When a Union man escapes them, the\r\n    rebels are always opposed to the removal of his wife and children,\r\n    as, by retaining them, they hope to get the husband and father\r\n    again into their hands. And, as all communication by letter is cut\r\n    off, many a man, during the last six months, has stolen back to\r\n    see his family at the risk of his life, and lost it.\r\n\r\n    Dr. R. was the first man arrested in Ripley County; but LOWE\r\n    immediately began a lively persecution of suspected Unionists.\r\n    Some escaped with life, their enemies being satisfied with\r\n    scourging and plundering them, but scores were hung. LOWE'S\r\n    soldiers furnished and equipped themselves by robbing Union houses\r\n    and the country stores.\r\n\r\n    Many suspected Union men shielded themselves by denouncing others,\r\n    giving information of the property of others, and being forward in\r\n    insulting and quartering lawless soldiers upon defenceless\r\n    families. So that, Dr. R. states, there are created between\r\n    neighbors, all through that section, feuds which will never cease\r\n    to exist. Many a man has suffered family wrongs from his neighbor\r\n    which he thirsts to go back to revenge, which he swears yet to\r\n    revenge, and which he feels nothing but the blood of the offender\r\n    can revenge! And should peace be declared to-morrow, a social war\r\n    would still exist in Missouri!\r\n\r\n    People dwelling in the free States, where the schoolhouse is not\r\n    abolished, where the laws still live and restrain, can have no\r\n    conception of the state of society where the whole community has\r\n    returned suddenly to savage life; a life wherein the reaction from\r\n    a former restraint renders the viciously disposed far more\r\n    intensely barbarous than his red brother of the plain.\r\n\r\n    LOWE'S men, and all similarly recruited by order of ex-Governor\r\n    JACKSON, remained in service six months, and were to be paid in\r\n    State scrip. But as that was worthless, they never received\r\n    anything in rations, clothing, or money, but what they plundered\r\n    from their fellow-citizens. Many of these state rights soldiers\r\n    have since enlisted in the Confederate army; but Confederate paper\r\n    being fifty per cent. below par, and not rising, the legitimate\r\n    pay of the Southern soldier is likely to be small.\r\n\r\n    In Northern Arkansas, all males between fifteen and forty-five\r\n    years of age have been ordered to be ready for the Confederate\r\n    service when called upon. This has caused a fear of failure in\r\n    next year's crops from scarcity of men in that section. There is\r\n    great suffering among them now. Salt rose to $25 a sack. The\r\n    authorities prohibited the holders from charging more than $12,\r\n    the present price. Pins are $1.50 per paper; jeans $5 per yard;\r\n    and everything else in proportion.\r\n\r\n    One word in comment. Every additional fact of the deplorable\r\n    condition of things in the slave States is an additional reason\r\n    why the North should firmly meet the cause of this misery. If the\r\n    North should have the manhood to strike a blow at slavery _now_,\r\n    still a generation must pass before harmony would ensue; but if\r\n    the North _evades and dallies_, scores of generations must live\r\n    and die before America sees unbroken peace again.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhile the war goes on, the contrabands go off. A writer in the Norfolk\r\n_Day Book_ complains that slaves are escaping from that city in great\r\nnumbers, asserting that they get away through the instrumentality of\r\n_secret societies_ in Norfolk, which hold their meetings weekly, and in\r\nopen day. No one can doubt that this war is clearing the Border of its\r\nblack chattels in double-quick time. Why not strike boldly, and secure\r\nit by offering to pay all its loyal slave-holders for their property? Of\r\none thing, let the country rest assured--the friends of Emancipation\r\nwill not brook much longer delay. It MUST and SHALL be carried\r\nthrough,--_and we are strong enough to do it_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThurlow Weed grows apace, and occasionally writes a good thing from\r\nLondon--as, for instance, in the following:--\r\n\r\n    At breakfast, a few days since, a distinguished member of\r\n    Parliament, who has been much in America, remarked, with emphasis,\r\n    that he had formerly entertained a high opinion of 'JUDGE LYNCH,'\r\n    looking with much favor upon that species of impromptu\r\n    jurisprudence known as 'Lynch law,' but since it failed to hang\r\n    FLOYD, COBB and THOMPSON, of BUCHANAN'S cabinet, he had ignored\r\n    and was disgusted with the system.\r\n\r\nWhat would the distinguished member have said had he been familiar with\r\nthe Catiline steamer case, the mysteries of shoddy contracts, the\r\noutfitting of the Burnside expedition, and innumerable other\r\nrascalities? The gentleman was right,--Lynch law has proved a failure;\r\nand, if we err not, another kind of law has of late months been not very\r\nfar behind it in inefficiency. Our Southern foes have at least one noble\r\ntrait--they hang their rascals.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n'_Non dum_,' 'not yet,' was the motto of a great king, who, when the\r\ntime came, shook Europe with his victories. 'Not yet,' says the\r\nChristian, struggling through trial and temptation towards the peace\r\nwhich passeth understanding and a heavenly crown. 'Not yet,' says the\r\nbrave reformer, fighting through lies and petty malice, and all the\r\nmeanness of foes lying in wait, ere he can convince the world that he is\r\nin the right. 'Not yet,' says the soldier, as he marches his weary\r\nround, waiting to be relieved, and musing on the battle and the war for\r\nwhich he has pledged his life and his honor--and they are a world to\r\n_him_. 'Not yet,' says every great man and woman, laying hands to every\r\nnoble task in time, which is to roll onward in result into eternity.\r\nWait, wait, thou active soul,--even in thy most vigorous activity let\r\nthy work be one of waiting, and of great patience in thy fiercest toil.\r\nThere will come a day of triumph, when the fresh wind will banish the\r\nheat, and fan the laurel on thy brow. Such is the true moral of the\r\nfollowing lyric:--\r\n\r\n  FALLEN.\r\n\r\n  BY EDWARD S. RAND.\r\n\r\n  Blow gently, Oh ye winter winds,\r\n    Along the ferny reaches,\r\n  Nor whirl the yellow leaves which cling\r\n    Upon the saddened beeches;\r\n  And gently breathe upon the hills\r\n    Where spring's first violets perished,--\r\n  Died like the budding summer hopes\r\n    Our hearts too fondly cherished.\r\n\r\n  Oh memory, bring not back the past,\r\n    To brim our cup of sorrow;\r\n  The drear to-day creeps on to bring\r\n    A drearier to-morrow.\r\n  Can streaming eyes and aching hearts\r\n    Glow at the battle's story,\r\n  Or they who stake their all and lose\r\n    Exult in fame and glory?\r\n\r\n  Oh, lay them tenderly to rest,\r\n    Those for their country dying,--\r\n  Let breaking hearts and trembling lips\r\n    Pour the sad dirge of sighing.\r\n  Yet louder than the requiem raise\r\n    The song of exultation,\r\n  That the great heritage is ours\r\n    _To die to save the nation_.\r\n\r\n  In patience wait, nor think that yet\r\n    Shall Right and Freedom perish,\r\n  Nor yet Oppression trample down\r\n    The heritage we cherish!\r\n  For still remember, precious things\r\n    Are won by stern endeavor,--\r\n  Though in the strife our heart-strings break,\r\n    The Right lives on forever.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen you write let your chirography be legible. Strive not overmuch\r\nafter beauty of finish, make not your _a_'s like unto _u_'s or your\r\n_o_'s like _v_'s; let not your heart be seduced by the loveliness of\r\nflourishes, and be not tempted of long-tailed letters. Above all, write\r\nyour own name distinctly,--which is more than many do, and much more\r\nthan was done by the gentleman described in the following letter from a\r\nkindly correspondent:--\r\n\r\n    MADISON, WIS.\r\n\r\n    DEAR CONTINENTAL:\r\n\r\n    The holder of any considerable quantity of Wisconsin currency is\r\n    liable not only to the occasional loss consequent upon the\r\n    absquatulation of a tricksy wild-cat, but also to great perplexity\r\n    as to the name of the gentleman who countersigns the bills. These\r\n    inscrutable counter-signatures are accomplished by ROBERT MENZIES,\r\n    our excellent Deputy Bank Comptroller. His cabalistic 'R. Menzies'\r\n    does not greatly resemble a well-executed specimen of copperplate\r\n    engraving. The initial 'R' is always plain enough, but the\r\n    'Menzies' is sometimes read Moses, and sometimes Muggins, and is\r\n    always liable to be translated Meazles.\r\n\r\n    Mr. MENZIES is a Scotchman, brimful of Caledonian lore and\r\n    enthusiasm. His penmanship is not always so sublimely obscure as\r\n    his performances on bank-paper would indicate; but in its best\r\n    estate it is capable of sometimes more than one reading. Witness\r\n    the following instance: In the winter of 1858 and '9, Mr. MENZIES\r\n    delivered a very interesting lecture, before a literary society,\r\n    in Prairie du Chien; subject, THE SONG-WRITERS OF SCOTLAND. Mr. M.\r\n    not residing at Prairie du Chien, the lecture was, of course, the\r\n    subject of a preliminary correspondence. At the meeting of the\r\n    society next previous to the one when the lecture was delivered,\r\n    Elder BRUNSON, the president, announced that he had received a\r\n    letter from Mr. MENZIES, accepting the invitation to lecture\r\n    before the society, and naming as the subject of his lecture 'THE\r\n    LONG WINTERS or SCOTLAND.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nReaders who are afflicted with the isothermal doctrine may experience\r\nsome benefit from the perusal of a letter for which we are indebted to a\r\nfriend not very far 'out West:'--\r\n\r\n    SPRINGFIELD, MASS.\r\n\r\n    DEAR CONTINENTAL:\r\n\r\n    I have a friend who would be sound on the goose, as I verily\r\n    believe, and a patriotic anti-Jeff Davis platform Emancipator, if\r\n    he hadn't unfortunately picked up a fine learned word. That word\r\n    is\r\n\r\n    ISOTHERMAL.\r\n\r\n    And that word he carries about as a hen carries a boiled\r\n    potato--something too big to swallow but nice to peck at. And he\r\n    pecks at it continually.\r\n\r\n    'I could admit that the slaves should be free,' he says, 'but then\r\n    nature, you know, has fixed an isothermal line. She has\r\n    isothermally deemed that south of that line the black is\r\n    isothermally fitted to isothermalize or labor according to the\r\n    climate as a slave.'\r\n\r\n    'Good,' I replied. 'So you admit that all anthropological\r\n    characteristics as developed by climate are quite right?'\r\n\r\n    [He liked that word 'anthropological,' and assented.]\r\n\r\n    'Good again. Well, then, you must admit that to judge by\r\n    statistics there is an isothermal line of unchastity, or \"what\r\n    gods call gallantry,\" and further north, one of drunkenness? How\r\n    much morality is there in a tropical climate? How many temperate\r\n    men to the dozen in Scandinavia or Russia?'\r\n\r\n    My isothermalist attempted a weak parry, but failed. When he\r\n    recovers I will inform you.\r\n\r\n    YOURS TRULY.\r\n\r\n    P.S.

WOLCOTT for the following sketch of War Life:--\r\n\r\n    'TAKEN PRISONER.'\r\n\r\n    It was a terrible battle. Amid the rattle of musketry and\r\n    whistling of bullets, the clashing of sabres, the unearthly cries\r\n    of wounded horses and the wild shouting of men, the clear voice of\r\n    Lieutenant Hugh Gregory rang out: 'Rally! my brave boys, rally,\r\n    and avenge the Captain's death!'\r\n\r\n    'Not quite so fast, sir,' quietly remarked a rebel officer,\r\n    bringing his sword to a salute; 'you observe that your men are\r\n    retreating and you are my prisoner.'\r\n\r\n    Hugh saw that it was so, and with a heavy heart gave himself up.\r\n\r\n    'Hurrah for the stars and stripes!' shouted a brave young soldier,\r\n    attempting to raise himself upon his elbow, but falling back,\r\n    exhausted from the loss of blood.\r\n\r\n    'Damn you, I'll stripe you!' exclaimed a brutal fellow, rising in\r\n    his stirrups and aiming a blow at the wounded man.\r\n\r\n    'Dare to strike a helpless man!' shouted his commander; and he\r\n    warded off the blow with a stroke that sent the fellow's sabre\r\n    spinning into the air. 'Now dismount, and help him if you can.'\r\n    But it was too late; the brave soul had gone out with those last\r\n    words.\r\n\r\n    'Lieutenant,' said the rebel officer, whom we will know as Captain\r\n    Dumars, 'I see that you are wounded. Let me assist you upon this\r\n    horse, and one of my sergeants will show you the surgeon's\r\n    quarters.' And he bound up the wounded arm as well as he could,\r\n    helped him upon the horse, and, with a playful _Au revoir_, rode\r\n    on.\r\n\r\n    Hugh's wound was too painful, and he was too weak and tired, to\r\n    wonder or to think clearly of anything; he only felt grateful that\r\n    his captor was a gentleman, and quietly submitted himself to the\r\n    sergeant's guidance.\r\n\r\n    The battle was ended,--in whose favor it does not matter, so far\r\n    as this story is concerned,--and Captain Dumars obtained\r\n    permission to take Lieutenant Gregory to his mother's house until\r\n    he should recover from his wound or be exchanged.\r\n\r\n    When Hugh found himself established in a pleasant little chamber\r\n    with windows looking out upon the flower-garden and the woods\r\n    beyond, fading away into his own loved North land, he thought\r\n    that, after all, it was not so terrible to be a prisoner of war.\r\n    He was decidedly confirmed in this opinion when he occasionally\r\n    caught a glimpse of the lithe form of Annie Dumars flitting about\r\n    among the flowers; and being somewhat of a philosopher, in his\r\n    way, he determined to take it easy.\r\n\r\n    The presence of one of the 'Hessians' at Mrs. Dumars' house gave\r\n    it much the same attraction that is attached to a menagerie.\r\n    Feminine curiosity is an article that the blockade can not keep\r\n    out of Dixie, and many were the morning calls that Annie received,\r\n    and many and various were the methods of pumping adopted to learn\r\n    something of the prisoner,--how he looked, how he acted, how he\r\n    was dressed, and so forth.\r\n\r\n    'Impertinence!' he heard Annie exclaim, as one of these gossips\r\n    passed through the gate, after putting her through a more minute\r\n    inquisition than usual. And he heard dainty shoe-heels impatiently\r\n    tapping along the hall, and when she brought in a bouquet of fresh\r\n    flowers he saw in her face traces of vexation.\r\n\r\n    'I seem to be quite a \"What-is-it?\"'\r\n\r\n    'Shame!'--and she broke off a stem and threw it out of the window\r\n    with altogether unnecessary vehemence.\r\n\r\n    'Splendid girl!' thought Hugh; 'where have I seen her?'\r\n\r\n    And he turned his thoughts back through the years that were past,\r\n    calling up the old scenes; the balls, with their mazy, passionate\r\n    waltzes, and their promenades on the balcony in the moonlight's\r\n    mild glow, when sweet lips recited choice selections from Moore,\r\n    and white hands swayed dainty sandal-wood fans with the potency of\r\n    the most despotic sceptres; the sleigh-rides, with their wild\r\n    rollicking fun, keeping time to the merry music of the bells and\r\n    culminating in the inevitable upset; the closing exercises of the\r\n    seminary, when blooming girls, in the full efflorescence of\r\n    hot-house culture, make a brief but brilliant display before\r\n    retiring to the domestic sphere--Oh, yes--\r\n\r\n    'Miss Dumars, were you not at the ---- Institute last year?'\r\n\r\n    'Yes.'\r\n\r\n    'Then you know my cousin,--Jennie Gregory?'\r\n\r\n    'Yes, indeed:--and you are her cousin. How stupid in me not to\r\n    recollect it.'\r\n\r\n    And she told him how that 'Jennie' was her dearest friend, and\r\n    how in their intimacy of confidence she had told her all about\r\n    him, and shown her his picture, and--in short, Hugh and Annie\r\n    began to feel much better acquainted.\r\n\r\n    It was a few days after this that Hugh sat by the open window,\r\n    listening to Annie reading from the virtuous and veracious\r\n    _Richmond Enquirer_. Distressed by what he heard, not knowing\r\n    whether it was true or not, he begged her to cease torturing him.\r\n    She laid aside the paper with an emphatic 'I don't believe it!'\r\n    that could not but attract his attention, and he looked up in\r\n    surprise.\r\n\r\n    'I must tell you, Mr. Gregory--I have been tortured long enough by\r\n    this forced secrecy--_I am a rebel!_'\r\n\r\n    'That is the name we know you by,' he replied, smiling.\r\n\r\n    'But I am a _rebellious_ rebel. Yes,' she added, rising, 'I detest\r\n    with all my heart this wicked, causeless rebellion. I detest the\r\n    very names of the leaders of it. And yet I am compelled to go\r\n    about with lies upon my lips, and to act lies, till I detest\r\n    myself more than all else! I have consoled myself somewhat by\r\n    making a flag and worshiping it in secret. I will get it and show\r\n    it to you.'\r\n\r\n    'This,' she continued, returning with a miniature specimen of the\r\n    dear old flag, 'a _real_ flag, the emblem of a real living nation,\r\n    must be kept hidden, its glorious lustre fading away in the dark,\r\n    while that,' pointing to where the 'stars and bars' were\r\n    fluttering in the breeze, 'that miserable abortion is insolently\r\n    flaunted before our eyes, nothing about it original or\r\n    suggestive--except its stolen colors, reminding us of the\r\n    financial operations of Floyd! Oh, if hope could be prophecy--if a\r\n    life that is an unceasing prayer for the success of the federal\r\n    arms could avail, it would not be long before this bright banner\r\n    would wave in triumph over all the land, its starry folds gleaming\r\n    with a purer, more glorious light than ever!'\r\n\r\n    And as she stood there, with eyes uplifted as in mute prayer, and\r\n    fervently kissed the silken folds of the flag, Hugh wished that\r\n    his station in life had been that of an American flag.\r\n\r\n    Time passed on, and the prisoner was to be exchanged for a rebel\r\n    officer of equal rank. Captain Dumars brought him the\r\n    intelligence, and was surprised at the seeming indifference with\r\n    which he received it.\r\n\r\n    'You don't seern particularly elated by the prospect of getting\r\n    among the Yankees again.'\r\n\r\n    'I am eager to take my sword again; but my stay here has been far\r\n    from unpleasant. You, Captain, have been away so much that I have\r\n    not been able to thank you for making my imprisonment so pleasant.\r\n    I am at a loss to know why you have shown such favor to me\r\n    especially.'\r\n\r\n    'This is the cause,' replied the Captain, laying his finger upon a\r\n    breast-pin that Hugh always wore upon his coat, at the same time\r\n    unbuttoning his own; 'you see that I wear the same.'\r\n\r\n    It was a simple jewel, embellished only by a few Greek characters,\r\n    but it was the emblem of one of those college societies, in which\r\n    secrecy and mystery add a charm to the ties of brotherhood. And it\r\n    was this fraternal tie, stronger than that of Free-Masonry,\r\n    because more exclusive, that made Hugh's a pleasant imprisonment,\r\n    and made him happy in the love of one faithful among the\r\n    faithless, loyal among many traitors. For of course the reader has\r\n    surmised--for poetic justice demands it--that Hugh fell\r\n    desperately in love with Annie, and Annie _ditto_ Hugh. How he\r\n    told the tender tale, and how she answered him,--whether with the\r\n    conventional quantity of blushes and sighs, or not,--is none of\r\n    your business, reader, or mine; so don't ask me any questions.\r\n\r\n    It was the evening of the day before Hugh's departure. They, Annie\r\n    and Hugh, sat in the little porch, silent and sad, watching the\r\n    shadows slowly creeping up the mountain side towards its\r\n    sun-kissed summit, like a sombre pall of sorrow shrouding a bright\r\n    hope.\r\n\r\n    'And to-morrow you are free.'\r\n\r\n    'No, Annie, not free. My sword will be free, but my heart will\r\n    still linger here, a prisoner. But when the war is over, and the\r\n    old flag restored--'\r\n\r\n    'Then,' and here her eyes were filled with the glorious light of\r\n    prophetic hope, '_I_ will be _your_ prisoner.'\r\n\r\n    And still Hugh is fighting for the dear old flag; and still Annie\r\n    is praying for it, and waiting for the sweet imprisonment.\r\n\r\nThere has been many as sweet a romance as this, reader, acted ere this,\r\nduring the war. Would that all captivity were as pleasant!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n'I would not live alway,' says the hymn, and the sentiment has, like\r\nevery great truth, been set forth in a thousand forms. One of the most\r\ntruly beautiful which we have ever met is that of\r\n\r\n  THE CITY OF THE LIVING.\r\n\r\n  In a long-vanished age, whose varied story\r\n    No record has to-day,\r\n  So long ago expired its grief and glory--\r\n    There flourished, far away,\r\n\r\n  In a broad realm, whose beauty passed all measure\r\n    A city fair and wide,\r\n  Wherein the dwellers lived in peace and pleasure\r\n    And never any died.\r\n\r\n  Disease and pain and death, those stern marauders,\r\n    Which mar our world's fair face,\r\n  Never encroached upon the pleasant borders\r\n    Of that bright dwelling-place.\r\n\r\n  No fear of parting and no dread of dying\r\n    Could ever enter there--\r\n  No mourning for the lost, no anguished crying\r\n    Made any face less fair.\r\n\r\n  Without the city's walls, death reigned as ever,\r\n    And graves rose side by side--\r\n  Within, the dwellers laughed at his endeavor,\r\n    And never any died.\r\n\r\n  O, happiest of all earth's favored places!\r\n    O, bliss, to dwell therein--\r\n  To live in the sweet light of loving faces\r\n    And fear no grave between!\r\n\r\n  To feel no death-damp, gathering cold and colder,\r\n    Disputing life's warm truth--\r\n  To live on, never lonelier or older,\r\n    Radiant in deathless youth!\r\n\r\n  And hurrying from the world's remotest quarters\r\n    A tide of pilgrims flowed\r\n  Across broad plains and over mighty waters,\r\n    To find that blest abode,\r\n\r\n  Where never death should come between, and sever\r\n    Them from their loved apart--\r\n  Where they might work, and will, and live forever,\r\n    Still holding heart to heart.\r\n\r\n  And so they lived, in happiness and pleasure,\r\n    And grew in power and pride,\r\n  And did great deeds, and laid up stores of treasure,\r\n    And never any died.\r\n\r\n  And many yers rolled on, and saw them striving\r\n    With unabated breath,\r\n  And other years still found and left them living,\r\n    And gave no hope of death.\r\n\r\n  Yet listen, hapless soul whom angels pity,\r\n    Craving a boon like this--\r\n  Mark how the dwellers in the wondrous city\r\n    Grew weary of their bliss.\r\n\r\n  One and another, who had been concealing\r\n    The pain of life's long thrall,\r\n  Forsook their pleasant places, and came stealing\r\n    Outside the city wall,\r\n\r\n  Craving, with wish that brooked no more denying,\r\n    So long had it been crossed,\r\n  The blessed possibility of dying,--\r\n    The treasure they had lost.\r\n\r\n  Daily the current of rest-seeking mortals\r\n    Swelled to a broader tide,\r\n  Till none were left within the city's portals,\r\n    And graves grew green outside.\r\n\r\n  Would it be worth the having or the giving,\r\n    The boon of endless breath?\r\n  Ah, for the weariness that comes of living\r\n    There is no cure but death!\r\n\r\n  Ours were indeed a fate deserving pity,\r\n    Were that sweet rest denied;\r\n  And few, methinks, would care to find the city\r\n    Where never any died!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDoes the reader recall DEAN SWIFT'S account of the immortal Strudlbrugs\r\nand their undying miseries--it is in the City of Laputu, we believe.\r\nTheir life was passed as if in such a city. Ah, death! it is, after all,\r\nonly birth in another form. And to step to the ridiculous, we are\r\nreminded of an\r\n\r\n  EPITAPH IN A DEDHAM CHURCHYARD.\r\n\r\n  I've paid the debt which all must pay,\r\n  Though awful to my view,\r\n  On frightful rocks where billows poured,\r\n  And broken buildings flew.\r\n  The cruel Death has conquered me;\r\n  The victory is but small,\r\n  For I shall rise and live again,--\r\n  And Death himself shall fall.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere are not many of those who 'read the papers,' who have not met from\r\ntime to time with the quaint experiences of THE FAT CONTRIBUTOR,--a\r\ngentleman who, in the columns of the _Buffalo Republican_, and more\r\nrecently in the spicy _Cleveland Plain Dealer_, has often wished that\r\nhis too, too solid flesh would melt. It is with pleasure that we welcome\r\nhim to our pages in the following original sketch:--\r\n\r\nTHE 'FAT CONTRIBUTOR' AS A GYMNAST.\r\n\r\n  'But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks.'\r\n\r\n  RICHARD III.\r\n\r\n    Says the cardinal in the play--'In the bright lexicon of youth\r\n    there's no such word as fail.' Without stopping to discuss the\r\n    reliability of a lexicon that omits words in that careless manner,\r\n    I must say that in the dictionary of fat men who aspire to\r\n    gymnastics that word distinctly occurs. I had my misgivings, but\r\n    was over-persuaded by my friends. They said gymnastics would\r\n    develop muscular strength, thus enabling me to _hold_ my flesh in\r\n    case it attempted to run away. They added, as an additional\r\n    incentive, that the spectacle of a man who weighs nearly three\r\n    hundred pounds, doing the horizontal ladder, climbing a slack-rope\r\n    hand over hand, or suspending his weight by his little finger,\r\n    would be a 'big thing.' I asked them how I was to attain that end.\r\n    'By practice,' was the reply; 'practice makes perfect.' It\r\n    did;--it made a perfect fool of me, as you shall see.\r\n\r\n    I never had much taste for feats requiring physical effort, except\r\n    lifting--lifting with my teeth. The amount of beef, pork, mutton\r\n    and vegetables that I have lifted in that way is immense. After\r\n    hearing Dr. WINSHIP lecture, I practiced lifting a flour barrel\r\n    with a man inside of it, and finally succeeded in holding it out\r\n    at arm's length. [I may remark incidentally that the barrel _had\r\n    no heads in it_.]\r\n\r\n    To return to the case in hand (and a case in hand is worth two in\r\n    the bush): I was deluded into purchasing a season ticket in the\r\n    gymnasium, and one afternoon I sought the locality. A number were\r\n    exercising in various ways, and I laid off my coat preparatory to\r\n    'going in.' As I bent down to adjust a pair of slippers, I heard\r\n    some rapid steps behind me, and the next instant a pair, of hands\r\n    and a man's head fell squarely on my back, a pair of heels smote\r\n    together in the air, and with a somersault the gymnast regained\r\n    the ground several feet in advance of me. I assumed an indignant\r\n    perpendicular, when the fellow turned with well-feigned amazement\r\n    and stammered forth an apology. Bent over as I was, he had\r\n    mistaken me for a heavily padded 'wooden horse,' which formed a\r\n    portion of the apparatus.\r\n\r\n    Desiring to be weighed from time to time, in order that I might\r\n    note the effect of gymnastics upon my tonnage, I asked one, who\r\n    was resting after prodigious efforts to wrench his arms off at a\r\n    lifting machine, if there were scales convenient. He surveyed me\r\n    for a moment--looked puzzled--and finally replied\r\n    hesitatingly,--'Y-e-s, I think we can manage it.' He led the way\r\n    to a window overlooking the Ohio canal. 'Do you see that\r\n    building?' said he, pointing to a low structure on the heel path\r\n    side, extending partly over the canal. I intimated that the fabric\r\n    in question produced a distinct impression on the optic nerves,\r\n    and inquired its use. '_Weigh-lock_' he shrieked; '_go and be\r\n    weighed!_'\r\n\r\n    '_Go and be d----d!_' I yelled, furious at being thus victimized;\r\n    but my angry and profane rejoinder was lost in the shout of\r\n    laughter that went up from the assembled athletes.\r\n\r\n    Natural abhorrence of jokes, practical or otherwise, is a trait\r\n    among my people; it runs in the family, like wooden legs. I\r\n    immediately sought the boss gymnaster and related the manner in\r\n    which I had been introduced to his elevating establishment. I told\r\n    him I had come there neither to be made a horse of by one nor an\r\n    ass of by another. He pledged his word that the like should not\r\n    occur again, and I was appeased.\r\n\r\n    I first attempted the parallel bars, but they were never intended\r\n    for men of my breadth. My hands giving way, I became so firmly\r\n    wedged between the bars that it was necessary to cut one of them\r\n    away in order to release me. A wag pronounced it a feat without a\r\n    parallel.\r\n\r\n    The horizontal bar next claimed my attention. I had seen others\r\n    hang with their heads down, suspended by their legs alone, and the\r\n    trick appeared quite easy of execution. I succeeded in suspending\r\n    myself in the manner indicated, but--_revocare gradum_--when I\r\n    attempted to regain the bar with my hands, it was no go. I was in\r\n    a perspiration of alarm at once; my legs grew weak; my head swam\r\n    from the rush of blood; twist and squirm as I would, I couldn't\r\n    reach the bar with the tip end of a finger even. My head was four\r\n    or five feet from the ground, so that a fall was likely to break\r\n    my neck, and when my frantic efforts to clutch the bar with my\r\n    hands failed, I shrieked in very desperation. Men came running to\r\n    my aid. They raked the tan bark, with which the ground was strewn,\r\n    in a pile beneath me, to break my fall as much as possible, and,\r\n    relaxing my hold of the bar, I came down in a heap, rolled up like\r\n    a gigantic caterpillar, and dived head and shoulders into the tan\r\n    bark, where I was nearly smothered before I could be extracted. It\r\n    was a terrible fright, but I escaped with a few bruises.\r\n\r\n    My brief career as a gymnast terminated with the 'ladder act.' I\r\n    felt unequal to the task of drawing myself up the ladder (which\r\n    was slightly inclined from the perpendicular), as I had seen\r\n    others do, but once at the top I believed I could lower myself\r\n    down. A purchase was rigged in the roof, by which I was hoisted to\r\n    the top of the ladder, some thirty feet from the ground, when,\r\n    grasping a round firmly with my hands, the purchase was\r\n    disconnected from my waist belt, and I began the descent. It was\r\n    very severe on the arms, and I desired to rest myself by placing\r\n    my feet on a round, but my protuberant paunch would not permit it.\r\n    When I had accomplished about half the distance in safety, a round\r\n    snapped suddenly with the unusual weight. I remember clutching\r\n    frantically at the next, which broke as did the other; then\r\n    followed a sensation of falling, succeeded by a collision as\r\n    between two express trains at full speed, and I knew no more. When\r\n    I recovered consciousness, I was in my own bed, and four surgeons\r\n    were endeavoring to set my broken leg with a stump extractor.\r\n    Gymnastics are a little out of my line.\r\n\r\n    FAT CONTRIBUTOR.\r\n\r\nUnlike BRUMMEL, _we_ know who our fat friend is, and shall be happy to\r\nsee him again.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n'Talbot,' of Washington, one of those who keep the many chronicles of\r\ngovernment, gives us the following from his repertoire:--\r\n\r\n    Shortly after the inauguration of President Lincoln, and during\r\n    the period in which the throng of office-seekers was greatest, an\r\n    applicant for a clerkship in one of the departments received\r\n    notification to appear before the 'examining committee' for\r\n    examination as to qualifications. In due time he appeared, and\r\n    announced himself 'ready.' The aforesaid 'committee,' supposing\r\n    that they had before them a decidedly 'soft one,' determined to\r\n    enjoy a little 'sport' at the poor fellow's expense. After having\r\n    put a great many questions to him, none of which in the least\r\n    applied to the duties he would be expected to perform, he was\r\n    asked how he would ascertain the number of square feet occupied by\r\n    the Patent Office building. This question aroused in him\r\n    suspicions that 'all was not right,' and, with a promptness and\r\n    emphasis that effectually dampened the hopes of his questioners,\r\n    he replied, '_Well, gentlemen, I should employ an experienced\r\n    surveyor._'\r\n\r\nThe same correspondent tells us that--\r\n\r\n    In one of the rural towns of Illinois lived, a few years agone, a\r\n    very eccentric individual known as 'DICKEY BULARD,' whose original\r\n    sayings afforded no little amusement to his neighbors.\r\n\r\n    DICKEY had his troubles, the saddest of which was the loss of his\r\n    only son. Shortly after this event, in speaking of it to some\r\n    friends, he broke out in the following pathetic expression of\r\n    feeling:\r\n\r\n    'I'd rather a' lost the best cow I have, and ten dollars besides,\r\n    than that boy. If it had been a gal, it wouldn't a' made so much\r\n    difference; but it was the only boy I had.'\r\n\r\n    On another occasion, in referring to the death of his grandmother,\r\n    who had been fatally injured by a butt from a pet ram, DICKEY gave\r\n    vent to his feelings as follows:\r\n\r\n    'I never felt so bad in all my life as I did when grandmother\r\n    died. She had got so old, and we had kept her so long, _we wanted\r\n    to see how long we could keep her_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is the 'turn of the tune' which gives point to the far-famed legend\r\nof 'The Arkansaw Traveler,'--which legend, in brief, is to the effect\r\nthat a certain fiddling 'Rackensackian,' who could never learn more than\r\nthe first half of a certain tune, once bluntly refused all manner of\r\nhospitality to a weary wayfarer, avowing with many an oath that his\r\nhouse boasted neither meat nor whisky, bed nor hay. But being taught by\r\nthe stranger the 'balance' of the tune,--'the turn,' as he called\r\nit,--he at once overwhelmed his musical guest with all manner of\r\ndainties and kindnesses. And it is the 'turn of the tune,' in the\r\nfollowing lyric, from the soft tinkle of the guitar to the harsh notes\r\nof the 'beaten parchment,' which gives it a peculiar charm.\r\n\r\n  THE GUITAR AND THE DRUM.\r\n\r\n  BY R.

B., TENTH ILLINOIS\r\n\r\n\r\n  Evening draws nigh, and the daylight\r\n    In golden splendor dies;\r\n  And the stars look down through the gloaming\r\n    With soft and tender eyes.\r\n\r\n  I sit alone in the twilight,\r\n    And lazily whiff my cigar,\r\n  Watching the blue wreaths curling,\r\n    And thrumming my old guitar:\r\n\r\n  Old, and battered, and dusty,--\r\n    A veteran covered with scars;\r\n  Yet to me the most precious of treasures,\r\n    The sweetest of all guitars.\r\n\r\n  For a gentle spirit dwells in it,\r\n    That speaks through the trembling strings,\r\n  And in echo to my thrumming\r\n    A wonderful melody sings.\r\n\r\n  As I softly strike the measures,\r\n    The spirit murmurs low\r\n  A song of departed pleasures,\r\n    A dream of the long ago.\r\n\r\n  And like a weird enchanter\r\n    It paints in the star-lit sky\r\n  Pictures from memory's record,\r\n    Scenes of the days gone by.\r\n\r\n  And as the ripples of music\r\n    Float out on the evening air,\r\n  There comes to me a vision\r\n    Of the girl with the golden hair.\r\n\r\n  Kindly she turns upon me.\r\n    Those lustrous, violet eyes,\r\n  And my heart with passionate yearnings\r\n    To meet her eagerly flies.\r\n\r\n  Nearer she comes, and yet nearer,\r\n    At the beck of the spirit's wand,\r\n  And I feel the gentle pressure\r\n    On my brow of her warm, white hand--\r\n\r\n  _Tr-r-r-rum-ti-tum-tum, tr-r-r-rum-ti-tum-tum!_\r\n  'Tis the warning voice of the rolling drum.\r\n  Through the awakened night air come\r\n  The stern command and the busy hum\r\n          Of hurried preparation.\r\n  'Tis no time now for idle strumming\r\n  Of light guitars: in that loud drumming\r\n  Is fearful meaning; the hour is coming\r\n  That for some of us will be the summing\r\n          Of all life's preparation.\r\n\r\n  Quick, quick, my boys: fall in! fall in!\r\n  Now is the hour when we begin\r\n  The battle with this monstrous sin.\r\n  Onward to victory!--or to win\r\n         A patriot's martyrdom!\r\n  Stay no longer to bandy words;\r\n  Trust we now to our gleaming swords;\r\n  For foul rebellion's dastardly hordes\r\n         A terrible hour has come.\r\n\r\n  By all that you love beneath the skies;\r\n  By the world of cherished memories;\r\n         By your hopes for the coming years;\r\n  By the tender light of your loved one's eyes;\r\n  By the warm, white hands you so highly prize;\r\n         By your mothers' parting tears,\r\n  Swear the horrible wrong to crush!\r\n  What though you fall in the battle's rush,\r\n  And the velvet leaves of the greensward blush\r\n         With your young life's crimson tide?\r\n  The angels look down with pitying love,\r\n  And your tale will be told in the record above:\r\n         'For his country's honor he died.'\r\n\r\n  The gentle strings of the light guitar,\r\n  Waking soft echoes from memory's chords,\r\n         And tender dreams of home--\r\n  The noise, and the pomp, and the glitter of war;\r\n  The furious charge, and the clashing swords;\r\n         The song of the rolling drum.\r\n\r\nHow many a young heart has, in these later days, been turned from soft\r\nguitar-tones of idleness, to the brave, rattling measures of drum-life!\r\nIt will do good, this war of ours; and many a brave fellow will, in\r\nafter years, look back upon it as the school in which he first learned\r\nto be a thoroughly practical and sensible MAN.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe are indebted to a gossiping and ever most welcome New Haven friend\r\nfor the following anecdote of one of the men who, clothed in a little\r\nbrief authority, 'go about 'restin' people:'\r\n\r\n    Our village we consider one of the most pleasant in the country;\r\n    our boys full of life and activity, and our officers men of energy\r\n    and perseverance, and men who understand their importance. In\r\n    proof of these assertions, I offer the following sketch of an\r\n    occurrence a few years ago.\r\n\r\n    DICK BARNES was a blacksmith, and a man of considerable notoriety\r\n    in those days, and from the peculiar prominence of his front upper\r\n    teeth he had derived, from the boys of the village, the singular\r\n    nick-name of 'Tushy.' For two or three successive years he had\r\n    been elected constable, and the duties of this great public office\r\n    appeared to demand that he should neglect his legitimate private\r\n    business, so that it was said that the safest place for him to\r\n    secrete himself--the most unlikely place where he would be\r\n    sought--would be behind his own anvil. Like many others 'clothed\r\n    with a little brief authority' he was not overmodest in showing\r\n    his importance.\r\n\r\n    The boys were then, as they are now, fond of skating, and there\r\n    was a large pond near the centre of the village on which they used\r\n    to have fine times on moonlight evenings, and especially Sunday\r\n    evenings, and, as a natural consequence, when large numbers of\r\n    boys are engaged in sport, they were somewhat noisy.\r\n\r\n    One Sunday evening, when the ice was very smooth and the boys were\r\n    enjoying themselves, BARNES made his appearance on the ice and\r\n    ordered them off, in tones, and exclamations of authority. The\r\n    boys did not like this interference in their sports and couldn't\r\n    see the justice of his demand. 'That's old Tushy,' says one, and\r\n    the cry of 'Tushy,' 'Tushy,' soon passed among the crowd of\r\n    skaters, till BARNES began to think it personal, and was\r\n    determined to catch one of them and make of him an example. The\r\n    ice was 'glib,' as they termed it, and as they all had skates\r\n    except 'Tushy,' they were rather rude in their behavior towards\r\n    him,--a not very uncommon circumstance,--and though they were\r\n    careful to keep out of harm's way, they kept near enough to him to\r\n    annoy him. Finding all efforts to catch one of them fruitless,\r\n    with the advantage they had,--for 'the wicked _stand_ on slippery\r\n    places,'--he announced his determination to catch one of them\r\n    anyhow, and started for the shore.\r\n\r\n    Boys are usually quicker in arriving at conclusions than older\r\n    people, and one of them suggested that he had gone for his skates.\r\n    'Good! now we'll have some fun, boys,' says Phil Clark, who was a\r\n    good skater, and withal a good leader in a frolic. 'You follow me\r\n    and do as I tell you, and I don't believe old \"Tushy\" will follow\r\n    us far.' By general consent he led them to the dry, sandy shore,\r\n    and such as had them filled their handkerchiefs, and such as could\r\n    not boast of that superfluity filled their caps, with sand. 'Now,'\r\n    says Phil, 'when he comes back, and it won't be long, we'll form a\r\n    line and wait till he gets his skates on, when he'll put chase for\r\n    some of us. If he gets near any of us, some one sing out \"Bully,\"\r\n    and every boy drop his sand, and if he catches any one we'll all\r\n    pitch in.'\r\n\r\n    'Tushy' in a little while made his appearance, and soon had his\r\n    skates strapped to his feet, and after a few stamps upon the ice,\r\n    to see that they were properly secured, glided a few strokes and\r\n    started off for the boys. The moon was shining 'as bright as day,'\r\n    and old Tushy's movements were perfectly apparent. The pond was\r\n    huge, and afforded a good opportunity for a trial of speed, and,\r\n    though many of the boys were good skaters, 'Tushy' perseveringly\r\n    determined to capture one of them, and started for the one\r\n    nearest. This was 'Phil,' who was the master spirit of the frolic,\r\n    and as 'Tushy' approached with almost the certainty of capturing\r\n    him, he would glide gracefully aside and let him pass on. He had\r\n    almost caught up with a group of the smaller boys who were going\r\n    at full speed, when 'Phil' shouted out the word 'Bully.' In an\r\n    instant the contents of handkerchiefs and caps was deposited on\r\n    the glaring ice, the boys continuing their flying course. 'Tushy,'\r\n    elated with the prospect of capturing at least one of the urchins,\r\n    increased his speed with lunger strides, and was in the act of\r\n    grasping one, when the sparks from his steel runners, the sudden\r\n    arrest of his feet and the onward movement of his body, convinced\r\n    him that _he_ was caught. The impetus he had acquired with the few\r\n    last strokes on the smooth ice, and the sudden check his feet had\r\n    received from the sand, sent him sliding headlong many yards\r\n    towards an air-hole,--one of those dangerous places on ponds\r\n    suddenly frozen,--and soon the ice began to crack around him. The\r\n    water in the pond was not deep, but the ice continued to break\r\n    with his efforts to extricate himself. He found that the boys had\r\n    successfully entrapped him, and it was not until he had made a\r\n    promise not again to interfere with their sport that they\r\n    consented to assist him out. He kept his promise, and the boys\r\n    ever after, when they designed any extra sport on the ice, had his\r\n    nick-name for a by-word.\r\n\r\n    JAY G. BEE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n'Salt,' according to MORESINUS, 'is sacred to the infernal\r\ndeities,'--for which reason, we presume, those who were seated 'below\r\nthe salt' at the banquets of the Middle Ages were always 'poor devils.'\r\nAttic salt is always held to be more pungent when there is a touch of\r\nthe diabolical and caustic in it,--and therefore caustic itself is known\r\nas _lapis infernalis_. 'Poor Mr. N----,' said a country dame, of a\r\nrecently deceased neighbor who was over-thrifty, 'he always saved his\r\nsalt and lost his pork.' 'Yes,' replied a friend, 'and now the salt has\r\nlost its Saver.' The reader has doubtless heard of the lively young\r\nlady, named Sarah, whom her friends rechristened Sal Volatile.\r\nApropos--a New Haven friend writes us that--\r\n\r\n    My chum, Dr. B., is not a little of a wag. At a social gathering,\r\n    shortly after he had received his diploma, the young ladies were\r\n    very anxious to put his knowledge of medicine to the test.\r\n    'Doctor,' queried one of the fair, 'what will cure a man who has\r\n    been hanged?' 'Salt is the best thing I know of,' replied the\r\n    tormented, with great solemnity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAccording to a cotemporary--the Boston _Herald_--the best Christians may\r\nbe known by the pavements before their houses being cleaned of ice and\r\nsnow. This reminds us of a spiritual anecdote. A deceased friend having\r\nbeen summoned through a medium and asked where he had spent the first\r\nmonth after his decease, rapped out,--\r\n\r\n'I-n--p-u-r-g-a-t-o-r-y.'\r\n\r\n'Did you find it uncomfortable?'\r\n\r\n'Not very. While I lived I always had my pavements cleared in winter,\r\nand all the ice and snow shoveled away was given back to me in\r\norange-water ices, Roman punch, vanilla and pistachio creams, frozen\r\nfruits, cobblers, juleps, and smashes.'\r\n\r\nSomebody has spoken in an Arctic voyage of the musical vibrations of the\r\nice. There is certainly music in the article. 'Take care,' said a Boston\r\ngirl to her companion, as they were navigating the treacherously\r\nslippery pavement of our city a few days since; 'it's See sharp or Be\r\nflat.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSomebody once wrote a book on visiting-cards. There is a great variety\r\nof that article; an English ambassador once papered his entire suit of\r\nrooms with that with which a Chinese mandarin honored him. MICHAEL\r\nANGELO left a straight line as a card, and was recognized by it. Our\r\nfriend H---- once distributed blank pasteboards in Philadelphia, and\r\neverybody said, 'Why, H---- has been here!' Not long since, a lady\r\ndwelling in New York asked her seven-year-old GEORGY where he had been.\r\n\r\n'Out visiting.'\r\n\r\n'Did you leave your card?'\r\n\r\n'No; I hadn't any, so I left a marble!'\r\n\r\nGEORGY'S idea was that cards were playthings. And _cartes de visite_ are\r\nmost assuredly the playthings for children of an older growth, most in\r\nvogue at the present day. Go where you will, the albums are examined,\r\nnay, some collectors have even one or two devoted solely to children, or\r\nofficers, or literary men, or young ladies. The following anecdote\r\nrecords, however, as we believe, 'an entirely new style' of\r\nvisiting-card:--\r\n\r\n    Madam X. was busy the other morning. Miss Fanny Z. 'just ran in to\r\n    see her' _en amie_, without visiting-cards.\r\n\r\n    The waiter carried her name to Madam X. Meanwhile Miss Fannie,\r\n    circulating through the parlors, saw that there was dust on the\r\n    lower shelf of an étagére, so she delicately traced the letters\r\n\r\n    _Smut_\r\n\r\n    thereon and therefore. Waiter enters, and regrets that Madam X. is\r\n    so very much engaged that she is invisible. Miss Fanny flies home.\r\n\r\n    In the evening she meets Madam X., who is 'perfectly enchanted' to\r\n    see her. 'Ah, Fanny, dear, I am charmed to see you; the waiter\r\n    forgot your name this morning, but I was delighted to see your\r\n    ingenuity. Would you believe it, the first thing I saw on entering\r\n    the parlor was your card on the étagére!'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Naugatuck railroad, according to a friend of the CONTINENTAL,\r\n\r\n    Is in many places cut through a rugged country, and the rocks\r\n    thereabout have an ugly trick of rolling down upon the track when\r\n    they get tired of lying still. So the company employ sentinels\r\n    who traverse the dangerous territory before the morning train goes\r\n    through. One of these,--Pat K. by name,--while on his beat, met\r\n    Dennis, whose hand he had last shaken on the 'Green Isle.' After\r\n    mutual inquiries and congratulations, says Dennis, 'What are you\r\n    doin' these days, Pat?' 'Oh, I'm consarned in this railroad\r\n    company. I go up the road fur the likes o' four miles ivry mornin'\r\n    to see is there ony rocks on the thrack.' 'And if there is?' 'Why,\r\n    I stops the trains, sure.' 'Faith,' said Dennis, 'what the divil's\r\n    the good o' that--_wouldn't the rocks stop 'em?_'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Hibernian idea of a meeting is, we should judge, peculiar, and not,\r\nas a rule, amicable. 'What are ye doing here, Pat?' inquired one of the\r\nGreen Islanders who found a friend one morning in a lonely spot. 'Troth,\r\nDinnis, and it's waiting to mate a gintleman here I'm doing.' 'Waiting\r\nfor a frind is it?' replied Dennis; 'but where is yer shillaly thin?'\r\nThis was indeed a misapprehension, and of the kind which, as a\r\nbenevolent clergyman complained, who was actively engaged in home\r\nmission work, was one of the most constant sources of his frequent\r\nannoyances. 'Why,' he remarked, 'it was only the other morning that I\r\nheard of a poor girl who was dying near the Five Points, and went to\r\nadminister to her such comfort as it might be in my power to render. I\r\nmet an impudent miss leaving the room, who, when I inquired for the\r\nsufferer by name, replied, \"It's no use; you're too late, old\r\nfellow,--she's give me her pocket-book and all her things.\"'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA friend has called our attention to the following extract from an\r\nadvertisement in a New York evening paper, and requests an\r\nexplanation:--\r\n\r\n    STRABISMUS, OR CROSS-EYE, IN ITS WORST STAGES, CURED IN ONE\r\n    MINUTE. READ!\r\n\r\n    NEWARK, August 14th, 1861.\r\n\r\n    Dear Doctor: I write to express my thanks for the great difference\r\n    you have made in my appearance by your operation on my eye. I have\r\n    had a _squint_, or _cross-eye_, since birth, and in less than one\r\n    minute, and with VERY LITTLE PAIN, you have made my eyes perfectly\r\n    straight and natural. Having consulted in Europe the greatest\r\n    _Aurists_, I, therefore, can testify that your system of restoring\r\n    the _hearing_ to the deaf is at once scientific, safe and sure;\r\n    and I confidently recommend all deaf to place themselves under\r\n    your care. W.T.\r\n\r\nThere's a nut to crack. Having had a cross-eye cured in one minute, Mr.\r\nT. can _therefore_ testify that the system by which he was enabled to\r\nsee is just the thing to enable the deaf to hear! But an instant's\r\nreflection convinced us of the true state of the case. There is an old\r\nGerman song which translated saith:\r\n\r\n  'I am the Doctor Iron-beer,\r\n  The one who makes the blind to hear,\r\n  The man who makes the deaf to see:--\r\n  Come with your invalids to me.'\r\n\r\nWe evidently have a Doctor Iron-beer among us. 'He still lives,' and\r\nenables people to outdo the clairvoyants, who read with their fingers,\r\nby qualifying his patients to peruse the papers with their auricular\r\norgans.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWalter will receive our thanks for the following æsthetic\r\ncommunication:--\r\n\r\n    DEAR CONTINENTAL:\r\n\r\n    Do you know the superb picture of Judith and Holofernes, by\r\n    ALLORI? Of course. But the legend?\r\n\r\n    The painter ALLORI was blessed and cursed with a mistress, one of\r\n    the most beautiful women in an age of beauty. He loved her, and\r\n    she tormented him, until, to set forth his sufferings, he painted\r\n    _la belle dame sans mercy_ as Judith, holding his own decapitated\r\n    head by the hair.\r\n\r\n    'She was more than a match for her lover,' said a young lady,\r\n    who--between us--I think is more beautiful than the 'Judith.'\r\n\r\n    'Yes,' was the answer; 'the engraving proves that she got a-head\r\n    of him.'\r\n\r\n    Of course it was Holofernally bad. I once heard a better one on\r\n    the same subject, of scriptural be-head-edness. Where is a centaur\r\n    first mentioned? John's head on a charger. The postage stamp on\r\n    your lawyer's bill--mine especially--represents the same thing,\r\n    with the substitution of General Washington for John. Rarey tamed\r\n    Cruiser--I wonder if he could do anything by way of 'taking down'\r\n    this legal 'charger' of mine.\r\n\r\n  Yours truly,\r\n  WALTER\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMuch has been written on oysters. There was a time when England sent\r\nnothing else abroad. 'The poor Britons--they are good for something,'\r\nsays SALLUST, in 'The Last Days of Pompeii;' 'they produce an oyster.'\r\nIn these days, they export no oysters, but in lieu thereof give us\r\nplenty of pepper-sauce. But to the point,--we mean to the poem,--for\r\nwhich we are indebted to a Philadelphia contributor:--\r\n\r\n  OYSTERS!\r\n\r\n  He stood beside the oysters. Near him lay\r\n  A dozen raw upon the half-shell: he\r\n  With fork stood ready to engulf them all,\r\n  When to his side a reverend gray-beard came.\r\n  Pointing his index finger to the Natives,\r\n  Slowly he spoke, with measured voice and low:--\r\n  'They are the same, THE SAME! I've eaten them\r\n  In London, small and coppery; at Ostend,\r\n  A little better; and in the Condotti,\r\n  Yea, in the Lepré--'tis an eating-house\r\n  Frequented by the many-languaged artists\r\n  Of great imperial Rome. At Baiæ: also\r\n  I've tasted that nice kind described by MARTIAL,\r\n  Who calls them ears of Venus;--there I've had 'em.\r\n  Also at Memphis--now I'm coming to it:\r\n  I've seen amid the desert sands of Egypt,\r\n  Exposed among the hieroglyphs, these Natives.\r\n  (The hieroglyphs, you know, are outward forms\r\n  Of things or creatures which unfold strange myths,\r\n  Read by the common eye in vulgar way,\r\n  But to the learned are types of truths gigantic.)\r\n  Thus unto you those oysters are but bivalves;\r\n  But unto me they're--P'raps you'll stand a dozen?'\r\n  'Well, I will, old hoss; it seems to me you need 'em!'\r\n  'Good! Then to me they are as hieroglyphs\r\n  Of our poor human state; as PLATO says,\r\n  \"The soul of man, a substance different from\r\n  The body as the oyster from the shell,\r\n  Does stick to it, and is imprisoned in it.\r\n  Its weight of shell doth keep it down and force it\r\n  To stay upon its muddy bottom. So does\r\n  Man's body hold his soul in these dark regions,\r\n  Keeping it ever steadily from rising\r\n  To those superior heights where are abodes\r\n  More fitting its serene and noble nature.\"\r\n  Good as a quarter-dollar lecture. Boy! fork over.'\r\n  'Another \"doz.\" to this old gentleman;\r\n  For I perceive he plainly hath it in him\r\n  To swallow down two dozen oysters' souls.\r\n  See what it is to be a philosopher!'\r\n\r\nThis is indeed finding sermons in 'shells.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n'Punning is a power,' according to somebody, and, like most power, is\r\nsadly abused. Take, for illustration, the following specimen of the\r\n'narrative pun:'\r\n\r\n    The reader knows that BYRON once punned on the word Bullet-in, and\r\n    was proud of it; distinctly proud, be it remembered. After which\r\n    comes the following:--\r\n\r\n    Some years ago it was summer time, and in the office of the\r\n    Philadelphia _Evening Bulletin_, one, as the French say, was\r\n    preparing the daily paper. Along Third Street streamed Shinners,\r\n    Bulls, Bears, and Newsboys,--in the sanctum, Editors wrote and\r\n    clipped,--proof rose up and down in the dumb waiter,--there was\r\n    the shrill scream of the whistle calling to the foreman far on\r\n    high,--\r\n\r\n    Suddenly there was a tremendous run in the front office.\r\n\r\n    A maddened cow,--an infuriate, delirious, over-driven\r\n    animal,--breaking loose from the cow-herdly creature who had her\r\n    in charge,--careered wildly past the _Ledger_ building.\r\n\r\n    One would have thought that the straw paper on which that sheet\r\n    was then printed might have tempted her to repose.\r\n\r\n    It didn't.\r\n\r\n    Past FORNEY'S paper:--he was proprietor of the _Pennsylvanian_ in\r\n    those days. Those days!--when he was Warwick, the king-maker, and\r\n    carried Pennsylvania for Old Buck. Bitter were the changes in\r\n    aftertimes, and bitterly did Forney give fits where he had before\r\n    bestowed benefits. On went the cow.\r\n\r\n    Right smack into the office of the evening paper, then engineered\r\n    by ALEXANDER CUMMINGS, now held by GIBSON PEACOCK.\r\n\r\n    Rush! went the cow.

Circumstances alter\r\ncases, and definitions modify both. Slavery, it now appears, is death,\r\nas every political economist claims, while the South is--the other\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following is from one who was not 'well off for soap:'--\r\n\r\n    DEAR CONTINENTAL:\r\n\r\n    It was my fortune, some time ago, while traveling through the New\r\n    England States, to lose my trunk, on my way to a very thriving\r\n    manufacturing village. Arrived at the principal hotel a few\r\n    minutes before the dinner hour, I was shown up to my room, every\r\n    article of furniture in which sparkled with newness,--its carpet\r\n    shining like fireworks, curtains painfully stiff, and the air\r\n    redolent of novelty.\r\n\r\n    One article of furniture, which I took to be a cottage piano or\r\n    melodeon, turned out, on raising the lid, to be a wash-stand,\r\n    amply munitioned with water, towels, and a new piece of soap.\r\n    Having noticed that the article had never been used, and my own\r\n    being lost with my trunk, I determined to put it to its legitimate\r\n    destination.\r\n\r\n    I commenced rubbing it between my hands, immersing it in water,\r\n    passing it quickly from one hand to the other, and using all other\r\n    persuasive attempts to solve it into lather. Useless; it was\r\n    _un-lather-able_, and hearing the gong sound for dinner, I gave it\r\n    up as a hopeless job.\r\n\r\n    After dinner, in conversation with the landlord, he asked me how I\r\n    liked my room. I told him that it pleased me very well, and that I\r\n    had but one fault to find,--that was, that the soap in the\r\n    wash-stand was the hardest I had ever seen, and I believed it was\r\n    made of iron.\r\n\r\n    'Well,' said he, with a diabolical smile, 'it _is_ hard soap, and\r\n    it ort to be--it's iron-y--for it's Cast-Steel!'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe annexed may be read with profit by the charitable:--\r\n\r\n    H---- has never yet been known to give one cent in charity. A\r\n    Christian called on him, the other day, and begged him to give\r\n    something to a soup society.\r\n\r\n    'Ah-h-h!' said H., 'war times, now. Can't give anything.'\r\n\r\n    'The soup society is very poor, and would be thankful for the\r\n    _smallest sum_.'\r\n\r\n    'Would it?' said H., cheerfully. 'Why, then, twice one are two.\r\n    Good-morning.'\r\n\r\nThis, we presume, may be called figuring as a benefactor.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOur Arabic-studying friend has supplied us with a fresh batch of\r\noriental proverbs:--\r\n\r\n    'A monkey solicited hospitality from devils. \"Young gentleman,\"\r\n    they replied, \"the house is quite empty of provisions.\"'\r\n\r\n    'Eat whatever thou likest, but dress as others do.'\r\n\r\n    'Like a needle, that clothes people, and is itself naked.'\r\n\r\n    'He who makes chaff of himself the cows will eat.'\r\n\r\n    'Give me wool to-day, and take sheep to-morrow.'\r\n\r\n    'He is high-minded but empty-bellied.'\r\n\r\n    'Easier to be broken than the house of a spider.'\r\n\r\n    'He descends like the foot of a crow, and ascends (like) the hoof\r\n    of a camel.'\r\n\r\nBut all yield in grim drollery to the last given:--\r\n\r\n    'There are no fans in hell.'\r\n\r\nWhich, as our friend declares, 'sounds as Western as Eastern.' Verily,\r\nextremes meet.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMany of our exchanges have spoken of the series entitled 'Among the\r\nPines,' now publishing in this Magazine, as being written by FREDERICK\r\nLAW OLMSTED. In justice to Mr. OLMSTED we would state that he is not the\r\nauthor of the articles in question, and regret that the unauthorized\r\nstatement should have obtained such general credence.\r\n\r\nA statement has also appeared in many journals declaring that the\r\nliterary matter of the CONTINENTAL MONTHLY is the same with that\r\npublished in the KNICKERBOCKER Magazine. We need not say that it is\r\n_entirely false_, as any reader may ascertain for himself who will take\r\nthe pains to compare the two publications. Not one line has ever\r\nappeared in common in the Magazines. The _Knickerbocker_ is printed and\r\nPUBLISHED in New York, at No. 532 Broadway, the CONTINENTAL in Boston,\r\nat No. 110 Tremont Street.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe editor of the CONTINENTAL begs leave to repeat that as the principal\r\nobject of the Magazine is to draw forth such views as may be practically\r\nuseful in the present crisis, its pages will always be open to\r\ncontributions even of a widely varying character, the only condition\r\nbeing that they shall be written by friends of the Union. And we call\r\nspecial attention to the fact that while holding firmly to our own\r\nviews, as set forth under the Editorial heading, we by no means profess\r\nto endorse those of our contributors, but shall leave the reader to make\r\nhis own comments on these.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nReaders will confer a favor by forwarding to us any pamphlets, secession\r\nor Union, on the war, which they may be disposed to spare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE KNICKERBOCKER\r\n\r\nFOR 1862.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the last year, when its present proprietors assumed\r\ncontrol of the Knickerbocker, they announced their determination to\r\nspare no pains to place it in its true position as the leading\r\n_literary_ Monthly in America. When rebellion had raised a successful\r\nfront, and its armies threatened the very existence of the Republic, it\r\nwas impossible to permit a magazine, which in its circulation reached\r\nthe best intellects in the land, to remain insensible or indifferent to\r\nthe dangers which threatened the Union. The proprietors accordingly gave\r\nnotice, that it would present in its pages, forcible expositions with\r\nregard to the great question of the times,--_how to preserve the_ UNITED\r\nSTATES OF AMERICA _in their integrity and unity_. How far this pledge\r\nhas been redeemed the public must judge. It would, however, be mere\r\naffectation to ignore the seal approbation which has been placed on\r\nthese efforts. The proprietors gratefully acknowledge this, and it has\r\nled them to embark in a fresh undertaking, as already announced,--the\r\npublication of the CONTINENTAL MONTHLY, devoted to Literature and\r\nNational Policy; in which magazine, those who have sympathized with the\r\npolitical opinions recently set forth in the KNICKERBOCKER, will find\r\nthe same views more fully enforced and maintained by the ablest and most\r\nenergetic minds in America.\r\n\r\nThe KNICKERBOCKER, while it will continue firmly pledged to the cause of\r\nthe Union, will henceforth be more earnestly devoted to literature, and\r\nwill leave no effort untried to attain the highest excellence in those\r\ndepartments of letters which it has adopted as specialties.\r\n\r\nThe January number commences its thirtieth year. With such antecedents\r\nas it possesses, it seems unnecessary to make any especial pledges as to\r\nits future, but it may not be amiss to say that it will be the aim of\r\nits conductors to make it more and more deserving of the liberal support\r\nit has hitherto received. The same eminent writers who have contributed\r\nto it during the past year will continue to enrich its pages, and in\r\naddition, contributions will appear from others of the highest\r\nreputation, as well as from many rising authors. While it will, as\r\nheretofore, cultivate the genial and humorous, it will also pay\r\nassiduous attention to the higher departments of art and letters, and\r\ngive fresh and spirited articles on such biographical, historical,\r\nscientific, and general subjects as are of especial interest to the\r\npublic.\r\n\r\nIn the January issue will commence a series of papers by CHARLES GODFREY\r\nLELAND, entitled \"SUNSHINE IN LETTERS,\" which will be found interesting\r\nto scholars as well as to the general reader, and in an early number\r\nwill appear the first chapters of a NEW and INTERESTING NOVEL,\r\ndescriptive of American life and character.\r\n\r\nAccording to the unanimous opinion of the American press, the\r\nKNICKERBOCKER has been greatly improved during the past year, _and it is\r\ncertain that at no period of its long career did it ever attract more\r\nattention or approbation_. Confident of their enterprise and ability,\r\nthe proprietors are determined that it shall be still more eminent in\r\nexcellence, containing all that is best of the old, and being\r\ncontinually enlivened by what is most brilliant of the new.\r\n\r\nTERMS.--Three dollars a year, in advance. Two copies for Four Dollars\r\nand fifty cents. Three copies for Six dollars. Subscribers remitting\r\nThree Dollars will receive as a premium, (post-paid,) a copy of Richard\r\nB. Kimball's great work, \"THE REVELATIONS OF WALL STREET,\" to be\r\npublished by G.P. Putnam, early in February next, (price $1.)\r\nSubscribers remitting Four Dollars will receive the KNICKERBOCKER and\r\nthe CONTINENTAL MONTHLY for one year. As but one edition of each number\r\nof the Knickerbocker is printed, those desirous of commencing with the\r\nvolume should subscribe at once.\r\n\r\nThe publisher, appreciating the importance of literature to the soldier\r\non duty, will send a copy _gratis_, during the continuance of the war,\r\nto any regiment in active service, on application being made by its\r\nColonel or Chaplain. Subscriptions will also be received from those\r\ndesiring it sent to soldiers in the ranks at _half price_, but in such\r\ncases it must be mailed from the office of publication.\r\n\r\nJ.R. GILMORE, 532 Broadway, New York.\r\n\r\nC.T. EVANS, General Agent, 532 Broadway, New York.\r\n\r\nAll communications and contributions, intended for the Editorial\r\ndepartment, should be addressed to CHARLES G. LELAND, Editor of the\r\n\"Knickerbocker,\" care of C.T. EVANS, 532 Broadway, New York.\r\n\r\nNewspapers copying the above and giving the Magazine monthly notices,\r\nwill be entitled to an exchange.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROSPECTUS OF The Continental Monthly\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere are periods in the world's history marked by extraordinary and\r\nviolent crises, sudden as the breaking forth of a volcano, or the\r\nbursting of a storm on the ocean. These crimes sweep away in a moment\r\nthe landmarks of generations. They call out fresh talent, and give to\r\nthe old a new direction. It is then that new ideas are born, new\r\ntheories developed. Such periods demand fresh exponents, and new men for\r\nexpounders.\r\n\r\nThis Continent has lately been convulsed by an upheaving so sudden and\r\nterrible that the relations of all men and all classes to each other are\r\nviolently disturbed, and people look about for the elements with which\r\nto sway the storm and direct the whirlwind. Just at present, we do not\r\nknow what all this is to bring forth; but we do know that great results\r\nMUST flow from such extraordinary commotions.\r\n\r\nAt a juncture so solemn and so important, there is a special need that\r\nthe intellectual force of the country should be active and efficient. It\r\nis a time for great minds to speak their thoughts boldly, and to take\r\nposition as the advance guard. To this end, there is a special want\r\nunsupplied. It is that of an Independent Magazine, which shall be open\r\nto the first intellects of the land, and which shall treat the issues\r\npresented, and to be presented to the country, in a tone no way tempered\r\nby partisanship, or influenced by fear, favor, or the hope of reward;\r\nwhich shall seize and grapple with the momentous subjects that the\r\npresent disturbed state of affairs heave to the surface, and which CAN\r\nNOT be laid aside or neglected.\r\n\r\nTo meet this want, the undersigned have commenced, under the editorial\r\ncharge of CHARLES GODFREY LELAND, the publication of a new Magazine,\r\ndevoted to Literature and National Policy.\r\n\r\nIn POLITICS, it will advocate, with all the force at its command,\r\nmeasures best adapted to preserve the oneness and integrity of these\r\nUnited States. It will never yield to the idea of any disruption of this\r\nRepublic, peaceably or otherwise; and it will discuss with honesty and\r\nimpartiality what must be done to save it. In this department, some of\r\nthe most eminent statesmen of the time will contribute regularly to its\r\npages.\r\n\r\nIn LITERATURE, it will be sustained by the best writers and ablest\r\nthinkers of this country. Life, by RICHARD B. KIMBALL, ESQ., the very\r\npopular author of \"The Revelations of Wall Street,\" \"St. Leger,\" &c. A\r\nseries of papers by HON. HORACE GREELEY, embodying the distinguished\r\nauthor's observations on the growth and development of the Great West. A\r\nseries of articles by the author of \"Through the Cotton States,\"\r\ncontaining the result of an extended tour in the seaboard Slave States,\r\njust prior to the breaking out of the war, and presenting a startling\r\nand truthful picture of the real condition of that region. No pains will\r\nbe spared to render the literary attractions of the CONTINENTAL both\r\nbrilliant and substantial. The lyrical or descriptive talents of the\r\nmost eminent literati have been promised to its pages; and nothing will\r\nbe admitted which will not be distinguished by marked energy,\r\noriginality, and solid strength. Avoiding every influence or association\r\npartaking of clique or coterie, it will be open to all contributions of\r\nreal merit, even from writers differing materially in their views; the\r\nonly limitation required being that of devotion to the Union, and the\r\nonly standard of acceptance that of intrinsic excellence.\r\n\r\nThe EDITORIAL DEPARTMENT will embrace, in addition to vigorous and\r\nfearless comments on the events of the times, genial gossip with the\r\nreader on all current topics, and also devote abundant space to those\r\nracy specimens of American wit and humor, without which there can be no\r\nperfect exposition of our national character. Among those who will\r\ncontribute regularly to this department may be mentioned the name of\r\nCHARLES F. BROWNE (\"Artemus Ward\"), from whom we have promised an\r\nentirely new and original series of SKETCHES OF WESTERN LIFE.\r\n\r\nThe CONTINENTAL will be liberal and progressive, without yielding to\r\nchimeras and hopes beyond the grasp of the age; and it will endeavor to\r\nreflect the feelings and interests of the American people, and to\r\nillustrate both their serious and humorous peculiarities. In short, no\r\npains will be spared to make it the REPRESENTATIVE MAGAZINE of the time.\r\n\r\nTERMS:--Three Dollars per year, in advance (postage paid by the\r\nPublishers;) Two Copies for Five Dollars; Three Copies for Six Dollars,\r\n(postage unpaid); Eleven copies for Twenty Dollars, (postage unpaid).\r\nSingle numbers can be procured of any News-dealer in the United States.\r\nThe KNICKERBOCKER MAGAZINE and the CONTINENTAL MONTHLY will be furnished\r\nfor one year at FOUR DOLLARS.\r\n\r\nAppreciating the importance of literature to the soldier on duty, the\r\npublisher will send the CONTINENTAL, _gratis_, to any regiment in active\r\nservice, on application being made by its Colonel or Chaplain; he will\r\nalso receive subscriptions from those desiring to furnish it to soldiers\r\nin the ranks at half the regular price; but in such cases it must be\r\nmailed from the office of publication.\r\n\r\nJ.R. GILMORE, 110 Tremont Street, Boston.\r\n\r\nCHARLES T. EVANS, at G.P. PUTNAM'S, 532 Broadway, New York, is\r\nauthorized to receive Subscriptions in that City.\r\n\r\nN.B.--Newspapers publishing this Prospectus, and giving the CONTINENTAL\r\nmonthly notices, will be entitled to an exchange.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[A] _Journey in the Back Country_. By Frederick Law Olmsted.\r\n\r\n[B] The Milwaukee, Wisconsin, _Sentinel_, of June 3, contained a\r\nconfirmation of these statements in regard to Northern Alabama. A\r\ngentleman returned from 'a prolonged tour through the cotton States'\r\ncommunicated a narrative, which demonstrated that the people of\r\nHuntsville and vicinity were very hostile to secession in January, that\r\n'at Athens the stars and stripes floated over the court house long after\r\nthe State had enacted the farce of secession,' and that, even in May,\r\nopen opposition to secession existed '_in the mountain portion of\r\nAlabama, a large tract of country, embracing about one-third of the\r\nState, lying adjacent to and south of the Tennessee valley_.' The writer\r\nadded, 'IN THEIR MOUNTAIN FASTNESSES THEY DO NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THE\r\nSOUTHERN CONFEDERACY, OR THE POWER OF ITS RULERS.'\r\n\r\n[C] It is proved, by the great increase of the cotton crop during this\r\nperiod, that the surplus increase of slaves was mainly composed of field\r\nhands purchased in the border States.\r\n\r\n[D] 'The Edwards Family;' page 11.\r\n\r\n[E] 'If some learned philosopher who had been abroad, in giving an\r\naccount of the curious observations he had made in his travels, should\r\nsay he had been in _Terra del Fuego_, and there had seen an animal,\r\nwhich he calls by a certain name, that begat and brought forth itself,\r\nand yet had a sire and dam distinct from itself; that it had an appetite\r\nand was hungry before it had a being; that his master, who led him and\r\ngoverned by him, and driven by him where he pleased; that when he moved\r\nhe always took a step before the first step; that he went with his head\r\nfirst, and yet always went tail foremost, and this though he had neither\r\nhead nor tail,' etc. etc.--_Freedom of the Will_, part 4.\r\n\r\n[F] Sismondi's History of the French.\r\n\r\n[G] Benôit, Hist. Rev. Edict of Nantes, book 7.\r\n\r\n[H] Dr. Baird, vol. I. p. 174.\r\n\r\n[I] Oxford town records.\r\n\r\n[J] Vandenkemp's Alb. Rec. viii.\r\n\r\n[K] Instances are frequent where Southern gentlemen form these\r\nleft-handed connections, and rear two sets of differently colored\r\nchildren; but it is not often that the two families occupy the same\r\ndomicil. The only other case within my _personal_ knowledge was that of\r\nthe well-known President of the Bank of St. M----, at Columbia, Ga. That\r\ngentleman, whose note ranked in Wall Street, when the writer was\r\nacquainted with that locality, as 'A No. 1,' lived for fifteen years\r\nwith two 'wives' under one roof. One--an accomplished white woman, and\r\nthe mother of several children--did the honors of his table, and moved\r\nwith him in 'the best society;' the other--a beautiful quadroon, also\r\nthe mother of several children--filled the humbler office of nurse to\r\nher own and the other's offspring.\r\n\r\nIn conversation with a well-known Southern gentleman, not long since, I\r\nmentioned these two cases, and commented on them as a man educated with\r\nNew England ideas might be supposed to do. The gentleman admitted that\r\nhe knew of twenty such instances, and gravely defended the practice as\r\nbeing infinitely more moral and respectable than _the more relation_\r\nexisting between masters and slaves.\r\n\r\n[L] Among the things of which slavery has deprived the black is a\r\n_name_. A slave has no family designation. It may be for that reason\r\nthat a high-sounding appellation is usually selected for the single one\r\nhe is allowed to appropriate.\r\n\r\n[M] It is not now improper to broach this button ruse, because it was\r\nrecently discovered at the South and is guarded against.",
