He was borne at Dangan Castle, in the county of\r\nMeath, Ireland, on the 1st of May, 1769.\r\n\r\nAs in the case of many of the chief nobility and landholders in Ireland,\r\nthe ancestors of the Duke were scions of an English house--the Colleys\r\n(afterwards Cowley), two of whom, named Walter and Robert Colley,\r\nproceeded to Ireland in the reign of Henry VIII., and located themselves\r\nin the County of Kilkenny. The two brothers were lawyers by profession,\r\nand in the year 1531, were invested with the office of Clerk of the\r\nCrown in Chancery, which they were to hold jointly during their lives.\r\nSix years afterwards, we find the elder brother Master of the Rolls in\r\nIreland, and the other Solicitor-General. In 1549, Walter was made\r\nSurveyor-General of Ireland. It was from this Walter that the immediate\r\nancestors of the Duke of Wellington were, by the mother's side,\r\ndescended.\r\n\r\nHis eldest son, Henry, acquired some distinction as a soldier in the\r\nreign of Elizabeth. He was also a member of the Irish Parliament for the\r\nborough of Thomastown. He was, moreover, a Privy Councillor, and was\r\nknighted.\r\n\r\nSir Henry Sydney, who was, perhaps, the wisest and most able of all the\r\nLords Deputy whom Elizabeth sent over to Ireland, appears to have\r\nentertained a very high opinion of Sir Henry Colley's abilities; for, in\r\nrecommending him to his successor in the Government, he describes him as\r\n\"valiant, fortunate, and a good servant;\" and speaks of him as his\r\n\"sound and fast friend.\" But he more especially praises the \"order,\" in\r\nwhich he kept his county.\r\n\r\nThus early did a member of this family earn praise for good service to\r\nthe State; and if we compare the measure of that praise with what we\r\nknow of the temper of the times, we might almost suppose that some\r\nportion of the spirit of the \"sound and fast friend,\" the \"valiant,\r\nfortunate, and good servant,\" had been inherited by his illustrious\r\ndescendant.\r\n\r\nThe immediate descendants of Sir Henry Colley were more or less\r\ndistinguished. His great-great grand-daughter, Elizabeth, married into\r\nthe family of the Westleys (afterwards Wellesleys) of Dangan, in the\r\ncounty of Meath. This family also was of English extraction, having\r\noriginally come from Sussex. Richard Colley, the nephew of the Elizabeth\r\nabovementioned, was adopted by Garret Wellesley, whose name and estates\r\nhe took in the year 1728, by patent from the Herald's office. He was\r\nauditor and registrar of the Royal Hospital of Kilmainham, and a\r\nChamberlain of the Court of Exchequer. He sat in parliament several\r\nyears for Carysford, and was, in 1747 raised to the peerage by George\r\nII., being created Baron Mornington. His son, Garret, was, in 1760,\r\ncreated Viscount Wellesley and Earl of Mornington. He married, on the\r\n6th February, 1759, Anne, eldest daughter of the Right Honourable Arthur\r\nHill, Viscount Dungannon, by whom he had issue, Richard the late Marquis\r\nWellesley, Arthur Gerald, who died in infancy, William Wellesley Pole,\r\nBaron Maryborough, Arthur Duke of Wellington, Gerald Valerian, D.D., Sir\r\nHenry, G.C.B., Francis Seymour, Anne, and Mary Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Mornington, who was chiefly remarkable for his strong\r\npassion for music, in which science he acquired no slight celebrity as a\r\ncomposer, died in 1781, leaving his property very much encumbered. Its\r\nmanagement was entrusted to Lady Mornington, who appears, by universal\r\nassent, to have been one of those remarkable women to whose care the\r\nworld is indebted, so much more than it conceives or will admit, for its\r\ngreat men. Although it may have been upon severer models, and by the\r\nlessons of more pretending teachers, that the Marquis Wellesley was\r\nformed into the vigorous ruler, and the wise, far-seeing statesman; or\r\nif his scarcely more illustrious brother must, from other sources, have\r\nimbibed that stern unswerving spirit which, in his after career,\r\ninsured truth to his views and certainty to his enterprises, yet one can\r\nscarcely allow a doubt that it is to the direction given by their\r\nadmirable mother to the minds of these two great men, while still in the\r\npliant season of youth, that we owe that high appreciation of truth and\r\nhonour, and that sense of the identity of virtue and duty, which, while\r\ntheir wisdom and prowess were spreading our military fame, and extending\r\nthe sphere of our civilising influence, enabled them also, by the\r\nexaltation of our national character, to secure for their country the\r\nrespect of all the world.\r\n\r\nOne of the first fruits of early lessons or of later reflection upon the\r\nmind of the young Earl of Mornington was, that he took upon himself the\r\npayment of his father's debts, an act entirely voluntary on his part.\r\n\r\nOf Lord Mornington, afterwards the celebrated Marquis Wellesley, it is\r\nunnecessary to say more in this place than that he was in the year 1797\r\nappointed to the Governor-Generalship of India, in which high office he\r\nwas enabled to develop, without the suspicion of undue preference, the\r\npeculiar talents of his younger brother--talents which his\r\ndiscriminating mind would probably have discovered even without the\r\nassistance of such close proximity.\r\n\r\nTo return to the immediate subject of these Memoirs:--His education\r\ncommenced at Eton, from whence he went to the military academy at\r\nAngers, in the department of the Maine and Loire, there being at that\r\nperiod no institution of the kind in this country.\r\n\r\nOn his return from the Continent, young Wellesley received (on the 7th\r\nof March, 1787), an ensigncy in the 41st regiment, he being then in his\r\neighteenth year. He became lieutenant on the 25th of December in the\r\nsame year; captain, on the 30th of June, 1791; major, on the 30th of\r\nApril, 1798; and lieut.-colonel on the 30th of September following.\r\nThese promotions were chiefly by purchase, and the lieut.-colonelcy (of\r\nthe 33rd) was bought for him by his brother. He was returned to the\r\nIrish parliament at the general election of 1790, for Trim, a borough\r\nbelonging to his brother.\r\n\r\nBrilliant as was the reputation which, within a very few years, he\r\nacquired as a soldier and a politician in the East, it will not excite\r\nsurprise to hear that his parliamentary displays did not in his early\r\nlife excite much attention. A friend of the writer of this memoir, a\r\ngentleman who was in the habit of being present, almost daily, in the\r\nIrish House of Commons, and who took critical notice of the remarkable\r\nmen of his time, states that the Duke never made any striking impression\r\nas a speaker; indeed; there was nothing whatever to distinguish him from\r\nthe herd of young parliamentary nominees, except a certain simple,\r\nstraightforward, firm, though unassuming statement of his opinions; and\r\neven this took place but seldom. The recollection of this gentleman\r\nconfirms the account of Sir Jonah Barrington, that--\"His address was\r\nunpolished; he spoke occasionally, and never with success; and evinced\r\nno promise of that unparalleled celebrity which he reached afterwards.\"\r\n\r\nThe following anecdote is not inconsistent with that reputation for\r\ninflexible honour which, in successive eras of his life, procured for\r\nthe Duke of Wellington the confidence of the Indian government, of the\r\nBritish army, and ultimately of the whole English nation. It is taken\r\nfrom the excellent detailed account of the Duke's military career,\r\nrecently published by Mr. Maxwell:--\r\n\r\n\"The appointment of Captain Wellesley to the staff of the Earl of\r\nWestmorland, had placed him in the household of the viceroy, and as\r\naid-de-camp required his constant attendance at the castle. The Irish\r\ncourt at that period was celebrated alike for its hospitality, its\r\nmagnificence, and its dissipation. The princely display of the lords\r\nlieutenant of those days entailed a heavy expenditure upon the numerous\r\nattachés of the court, and too frequently plunged young men of high\r\nfamily and limited fortunes into very distressing embarrassments.\r\nCaptain Wellesley's patrimony was small, his staff appointment more\r\nfashionable than lucrative, and it is not surprising that soon after he\r\nhad come of age he found himself involved in pecuniary difficulties. At\r\nthe time he lodged in the house of an opulent bootmaker, who resided on\r\nLower Ormand Quay. The worthy tradesman discovered, accidently, that his\r\nyoung inmate was suffering annoyance from his inability to discharge a\r\npressing demand. He waited on Lieutenant Wellesley, told him that he was\r\napprised of his embarrassments, mentioned that he had money unemployed,\r\nand offered a loan, which was accepted. The obligation was soon\r\nafterwards duly repaid; and the young aid-de-camp was enabled in a few\r\nyears to present his humble friend to an honourable and lucrative\r\nsituation. Nor did death cancel the obligation; the Duke's patronage,\r\nafter his parent's death, was extended to the son of his early friend,\r\nfor whom he obtained a valuable appointment.\"\r\n\r\nTo enter into any detailed account of the military career of the Duke of\r\nWellington, would be wholly beyond the scope of a work devoted more\r\nespecially to his Grace's character and services as a civilian; but were\r\nit not so, it would be unnecessary, after the many able biographies\r\nwhich have appeared since the publication of the dispatches by\r\nLieut.-Colonel Gurwood. The following is, therefore only a short summary\r\nof the Duke's proceedings from 1794, when he first entered on active\r\nservice, to 1815, when his functions as a military commander in the\r\nfield finally ceased.\r\n\r\nIt was in June, 1794, that Lieut.-Colonel Wellesley embarked at Cork, in\r\ncommand of the 33rd regiment, to join the Duke of York's army in the\r\nNetherlands. In the subsequent retreat from Holland he commanded, as\r\nsenior officer, three battalions, and conducted himself in a manner that\r\nalready drew on him the attention of military men.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1795, he again embarked, in the command of the 33rd, for the\r\nWest Indies, on board the fleet commanded by Admiral Christian. This\r\nfleet was, however, repeatedly driven back by the strong equinoctial\r\ngales, and in the January following it returned to port. Before it could\r\nagain sail, the 33rd regiment was ordered to India, and Colonel\r\nWellesley arrived at Bengal in February, 1797. When we consider the\r\nfate of a large portion of his fellow soldiers who went to the West\r\nIndies, and at the same time look forward to the peculiar facilities\r\nwhich the service in India afforded for developing the great qualities\r\nof mind which lay hid under the rigid exterior of the young soldier, it\r\nmay truly be said, that the moment at which the destination of the 33rd\r\nregiment was countermanded, was the point at which the fate of the Duke\r\nof Wellington turned. Nay more, if it be admitted that you rarely find\r\nin one man a combination of those peculiar qualities, which enabled the\r\nDuke to withstand, and ultimately to destroy, the military and political\r\nsystem established by the contrary tendencies which ruled the mind of\r\nNapoleon; if, too, it be conceded that the British government, even\r\nwhile the Duke was winning battles in Spain, were accustomed to resort\r\nto his counsel with regard to their more extended operations against the\r\ncommon enemy; if, in fact, it is owing to the sagacity, steadfastness,\r\nand perseverance of the Duke of Wellington, that we owe the peace of\r\nEurope; then must it be admitted, that upon the accident of tempests\r\nwhich obstructed Admiral Christian's fleet, and upon the accident of\r\nmilitary disposition, which altered the destination of the regiment,\r\ndepended not merely the fortunes of the Duke of Wellington, but also the\r\nfate of nations, and the peace of the world.\r\n\r\nBy this time, the Earl of Mornington had been appointed Governor-general\r\nof India, and the inveterate hatred of Tippoo Sultaun against the\r\nEnglish name was arming the natives to resistance. The first\r\nachievement of Colonel Wellesley, that drew attention to his name, was\r\nthe storming of Seringapatam, in which he commanded the reserve in the\r\ntrenches. On the capture of Seringapatam Colonel Wellesley was appointed\r\ngovernor, and at the same time named as one of the commission appointed\r\nto dispose of the territory conquered. But an office more honourable to\r\nhis character, was his selection to superintend the removal of the\r\nfamily of Tippoo Sultaun. Lord Mornington in his instructions\r\nsays:--\"The details of this painful but indispensable measure cannot be\r\nentrusted to any person more likely to combine every office of humanity\r\nwith the prudential precautions required by the occasion than Colonel\r\nWellesley; and I therefore commit to his discretion, activity, and\r\nhumanity, the whole arrangement.\"\r\n\r\nIn July, 1799, Colonel Wellesley was appointed to the sole command of\r\nSeringapatam and Mysore; and here his capacity for civil government, as\r\nwell as in military affairs, was fully developed. He had by this time\r\nbegun to feel his own strength, and to make it felt by others. The\r\nreader of his dispatches will perceive that, from the moment when he was\r\nplaced in a position of independent command, his mind appears to have\r\ntaken a higher stand: he recognised higher responsibilities: and one may\r\nalmost detect, in the confirmed self-reliance of his judgment even in\r\nthis comparatively limited sphere, a prescience of future greatness.\r\n\r\nThe year 1803 was signalised by Major-General Wellesley's conquests in\r\nthe Mahratta territory, and the battle of Assaye. Passing over the\r\ndetails of these campaigns, in which the rising commander displayed\r\nmilitary genius of the highest order, we come to the more pleasing task\r\nof enumerating the honours he received. A monument was erected in\r\nCalcutta to commemorate the last-named battle: the inhabitants of that\r\ncity presented him with a sword of the value of £1000: the officers of\r\nhis division presented him with a golden vase, afterwards changed for a\r\nservice of plate, on which the word \"Assaye\" was engraved: the British\r\nparliament voted him public thanks, he was made a Knight Companion of\r\nthe Bath: and addresses of the warmest praise were voted to him by the\r\ninhabitants of Seringapatam, and other places, which had benefitted by\r\nhis skill and prowess in the field, and his wisdom on the seat of\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1805, having resolved on returning to England, he resigned\r\nthe political and military powers that had been entrusted to him in the\r\nDeccan. On the 5th of March, a grand entertainment was given him at the\r\nPantheon at Madras, by the officers of the Presidency, civil and\r\nmilitary. On the 10th of September following, he arrived in the Downs;\r\nand, in the following month, he was appointed to the Staff, for the Kent\r\nDistrict.\r\n\r\nIn the November following, Sir Arthur Wellesley, as he had now become,\r\ncommanded the brigade in the expedition to Hanover under Lord Cathcart,\r\nwhich was withdrawn immediately after the battle of Austerlitz. In\r\nJanuary, 1800, on the death of the Marquis Cornwallis, he was appointed\r\ncolonel of the 33rd regiment; and on the 12th of April, in the same\r\nyear, he was returned to the House of Commons as member for Newport,\r\nIsle of Wight.\r\n\r\nIn this year, Sir Arthur Wellesley married the Honourable Catherine\r\nPakenham, third daughter of the second Earl of Longford.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of April, 1807, he was made a privy councillor; and on the\r\n19th of the same month, appointed chief secretary for Ireland, under the\r\nlord lieutenancy of the Duke of Richmond. On the 22nd, he was presented\r\nby the corporation of the city of Dublin with the freedom of that city.\r\nThe address in which it was conveyed was most complimentary, and shows\r\nthe high estimation in which he was already held on account of his\r\nbrilliant military and civil services in India. In June of the same\r\nyear, he accompanied Lord Cathcart in the expedition against Copenhagen;\r\nand in the only important action which took place at the affair at\r\nKioge--he commanded, and obtained distinction. The result of the action\r\nwas a capitulation, which Sir Arthur Wellesley was appointed to arrange.\r\nOn his return home, he received the thanks of parliament for his\r\nservices. Alluding to Sir Arthur Wellesley, the speaker said:--\"But I\r\nshould indeed be wanting in the full expression of those sentiments\r\nwhich animate this house and the whole country, if I forebore to notice,\r\nthat we are on this day crowning with our thanks one gallant officer,\r\nlong since known to the gratitude of this house, who has long trodden\r\nthe paths of glory,--whose genius and valour have already extended our\r\nfame and empire,--whose sword has been the terror of our distant\r\nenemies, and will not now be drawn in vain to defend the seat of empire\r\nitself, and the throne of his sovereign.\"\r\n\r\nA new and wider field of operations was now preparing for the rising\r\nhero. Napoleon, the unquestioned despot of the rest of continental\r\nEurope, had also grasped at the Peninsula. Both Spain and Portugal were\r\nin his possession, as far as military occupation and nominal sovereignty\r\ncould ensure them to him. The hostile efforts of England were suspended\r\nas far as regarded Europe; but an expedition had been fitted out at Cork\r\nagainst part of Spanish America, and Sir Arthur Wellesley was appointed\r\nto the command. Again a marvellous interposition of accidents prevented\r\nthis his second projected service in America. Before the troops could\r\nset sail, the insurrection at Madrid on the 2nd of May, 1808, against\r\nthe French under Murat, drew the attention of England to the Peninsula,\r\nwhere some hope of successful resistance to Napoleon began to dawn. Once\r\nmore the destination of the future conqueror was averted from the West,\r\nand he was ordered in command to the South.\r\n\r\nSir Arthur Wellesley landed at the mouth of the river Mondego in\r\nPortugal on the 3rd of August. Here he received intimation that\r\nre-inforcements under Sir John Moore were about to be sent. Moore was\r\nhis superior officer, and there was also Sir Hew Dalrymple and Sir Harry\r\nBurrard on their way, the former of whom would take the chief, and the\r\nlatter, the second command of the army. There was but little time for\r\nSir Arthur to strike the decisive blow, and although he was not the man\r\nto force a battle for the sake of fame, he could not but feel anxious\r\nfor distinction in this new sphere before all opportunity should be cut\r\noff, by the arrival of his superiors in command. Fortune in this was on\r\nhis side; and he had not been many days in Portugal before he was\r\nenabled to defeat the French at the pass of Roliça, and, on the 21st of\r\nAugust, to gain the battle of Vimeiro.\r\n\r\nWhile this battle was at its height, Sir Harry Burrard arrived, but\r\nwould not interfere with Sir Arthur's dispositions. The French were soon\r\nafter beaten on the left, and Sir Arthur then urged on Sir Harry the\r\nadvance of our right wing upon Torres Vedras, while our left would\r\npursue the enemy: his object being to cut off Junot's retreat on Lisbon.\r\nNo man now doubts that this was counsel wise as well as bold; but Sir\r\nHarry Burrard declined to take it, and the golden opportunity was lost.\r\nSir Arthur, who carried military obedience almost to the extent of a\r\nchivalrous sentiment, submitted to the orders, though he did not\r\nacquiesce in the judgment of his superior officer; but he could not help\r\nsaying to one of his officers who stood by, \"well, then, we have nothing\r\nto do but to go and shoot red-legged partridges!\" the common game of\r\nthat part of Portugal.\r\n\r\nSir Arthur Wellesley's subsequent conduct to Sir Harry Burrard was\r\nhighly honourable. He declared voluntarily before the Court of Inquiry\r\nthat, though he still differed in opinion with Sir Harry as to the not\r\nadvancing after the battle of Vimeiro, his opinion was, that Sir H.\r\nBurrard \"had decided upon fair military grounds, in the manner which\r\nappeared to him to be the most conducive to the interests of the\r\ncountry;\" and his belief, \"that Sir Harry had no motive for his decision\r\nwhich could be supposed personal to him, or which as an officer he could\r\nnot avow.\"\r\n\r\nThe untoward convention of Cintra, which followed the victory of\r\nVimeiro, was received in England with one universal cry of indignation.\r\nSir Arthur Wellesley was no farther implicated in it than that he signed\r\nit as one of the generals, although disapproving of it from the first.\r\nPending the inquiry, instituted in England on the convention, he\r\nreturned thither, and his evidence was satisfactory alike to the court\r\nand to the public.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th January, 1809, Sir Arthur received the thanks of parliament\r\nfor the battle of Vimeiro. The speaker, in delivering the thanks of the\r\nHouse of Commons, said:--\r\n\r\n   \"Amidst the contending opinions which have prevailed\r\n   upon other questions, the public voice has been\r\n   loud and general in admiration of your splendid\r\n   achievements. It is your praise to have inspired\r\n   your troops with unshaken confidence and unbounded\r\n   ardour--to have commanded, not the obedience alone,\r\n   but the hearts and affections of your companions in\r\n   arms; and having planned your operations with the skill\r\n   and promptitude which have so eminently characterised all\r\n   your former exertions, you have again led the armies of\r\n   your country to battle, with the same deliberate valour,\r\n   and triumphant success which have long since rendered your\r\n   name illustrious in the remotest parts of this empire.\r\n   Military glory has ever been dear to this nation; and great\r\n   military exploits, in the field or upon the ocean, have\r\n   their sure reward in royal favour, and the gratitude of parliament.\"\r\n\r\nSir Arthur, in his reply, observed:--\r\n\r\n   \"No man can value more highly than I do the\r\n   honourable distinction which has been conferred upon\r\n   me--a distinction which it is in the power of the\r\n   representatives of a free people alone to bestow, and\r\n   which it is the peculiar advantage of the officers and\r\n   soldiers in the service of his majesty to have held out\r\n   to them as the object of their ambition, and to receive\r\n   as the reward of their services.\"\r\n\r\nThe opening allusion of the speaker to \"contending opinions on other\r\nmatters,\" was intended to mark the sense of the house that Sir Arthur\r\nWellesley, at least, was free from blame as regarded recent transactions\r\nin the Peninsula. That the government thought so also, and had at last\r\nlearned to appreciate the value of an officer whom they had so recently\r\ntrammelled, was evidenced by the appointment of Sir Arthur, on the 2nd\r\nof April, to the command of the army in Portugal.\r\n\r\nTowards the close of the previous year, complaint had been made, in the\r\nHouse of Commons, of Sir Arthur holding the office of secretary for\r\nIreland while in the Peninsula. On the 14th of April, he resigned that\r\noffice, and on the 22nd, he arrived at Lisbon and assumed the command of\r\nan army, disproportioned, indeed, to the service expected of it, and\r\nstill more to that which they afterwards achieved, but strong in its\r\nconfidence in a general who had never made a false step, or suffered a\r\ndefeat.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of May, he carried Oporto by a _coup de main_. So complete\r\nwas the surprise, that Sir Arthur and his staff sat down to the dinner\r\nwhich had been prepared for the French commander.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th July following, the battle of Talavera was fought, after\r\nwhich (on the 26th August), Sir Arthur was raised to the peerage by the\r\ntitles of Baron Douro of Wellesley and Viscount Wellington of Talavera.\r\nIn the February following, he received the thanks of parliament for\r\nTalavera, and a pension of £2000 per annum was voted to him and his two\r\nnext heirs male.\r\n\r\nSo inferior was the numerical force of his army to that of the enemy\r\nthat Lord Wellington found his operations must for some time be confined\r\nto the defence of Portugal; and he, therefore, gave orders for the\r\nfortification of the lines of Torres Vedras, by which the capital of the\r\ncountry was covered. They extended from the sea to the Tagus, at a\r\npoint where the width of that river is such as to afford an adequate\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\nIt was characteristic of the mind of the man of whom we are writing,\r\nthat these works were planned and executed with a secrecy that baffled\r\nthe penetration of the enemy, and equally the suicidal curiosity of the\r\nEnglish newspapers.\r\n\r\nMassena was now the general of the French army. Wellington, before\r\nretiring within the lines, fought the action of Busaco (ten months after\r\nthe battle of Talavera), in which the French lost 5000 men, killed or\r\nwounded, and as many more disabled. After this victory, the English\r\nwithdrew within the lines, to cover Lisbon. Massena took up a position\r\nat Santaren, from whence he gradually retreated towards the frontiers,\r\nseveral affairs occurring between his troops and the English, by whom he\r\nwas closely followed. At length, he crossed the frontier, and\r\nWellington's object was, thus far, attained. On the 26th of the same\r\nmonth, he received the thanks of both houses of parliament for the\r\nliberation of Portugal.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, the army of Massena had been re-organized and\r\nreinforced, and on the 3rd of May he again attacked the allied British\r\nand Portuguese forces, for the purpose of relieving the fortress of\r\nAlmeida, which was under blockade. The action was fought at Fuentes\r\nD'Onoro, and resulted in the defeat of the French. Massena was then\r\nsuperseded, and Marmont appointed in his place.\r\n\r\nThe next object of the British commander was to take Badajoz and Ciudad\r\nRodrigo. The latter was stormed on the 19th January, and the former on\r\nthe 9th of April. For both, the thanks of parliament were voted; and\r\nLord Wellington, after having been created Conde de Vimeiro in Portugal,\r\nand Duke of Ciudad Rodrigo in Spain, was raised to an earldom (of\r\nWellington) at home, with another vote of 2000 l. per annum to maintain\r\nthe title.\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd of July, Marmont's army, which had been strongly reinforced,\r\nattacked the allies near Salamanca. The two armies had been watching\r\neach other for a considerable time, waiting for the favourable moment to\r\nattack. At length Marmont began, and having superior numbers, extended\r\nhis left for the purpose of turning the British right. Wellington, when\r\ninformed of this by one of his staff, was seated on the ground eating\r\nsome cold beef; suddenly starting up, he exclaimed, \"Marmont's good\r\ngenius has forsaken him.\" He immediately attacked the French where they\r\nhad weakened their line, and overthrew them from left to right. The loss\r\nof the enemy was severe, and Marmont himself lost an arm in the battle.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of August following, Lord Wellington entered Madrid, and was\r\nappointed generalissimo of the Spanish armies--a troublesome honour\r\nwhich there was some difficulty in inducing him to accept. He was\r\ncreated a marquis at home, thanks were voted to him for the battle of\r\nSalamanca, and he received a grant of 100,000 l. to purchase land. He\r\nwas also in December of the same year made Duque da Vittoria in\r\nPortugal.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the enormous force which had been brought together by\r\nthe French, the refusal of the Spanish generals to co-operate, the\r\nfailure of an attempt to capture the fortress of Burgos, and other\r\ncauses, compelled the allies to retreat to Ciudad Rodrigo, with the\r\ndetermination of returning to Spain at a more fitting time. This retreat\r\nwas conducted in the most admirable manner, and closed the campaign of\r\n1812.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing is necessarily a most meagre outline of events, on which\r\nvolumes have been written. Those who may be anxious to read the Duke of\r\nWellington's own account of the military operations, will find in the\r\npublic despatches his annual summaries: for 1809, in despatch No. 343;\r\nfor 1810, No. 504; and for 1811, No. 615. For 1812 there is no such\r\nsummary.\r\n\r\nIt would be a mistake, however, to suppose that the difficulties with\r\nwhich the Duke of Wellington had to contend during these the three first\r\nyears of his service in Spain, were confined to the making of military\r\ndispositions and the winning of battles. Other causes there were,\r\noperating as a drawback at every forward step, and obstacles sufficient\r\nto have wearied a less stout heart or a less determined spirit. To\r\noppose to a skillful and veteran enemy he had but an inadequate force,\r\nmost scantily supplied with provisions, and even with money. The French\r\ngenerals, restrained by no principle of honour or even of policy, were\r\naccustomed to plunder mercilessly for the subsistence of their troops:\r\nthe English commander would take nothing from the people but what was\r\npaid for on the spot in money or in bills on the English government.\r\nYet, such was the apathy (or worse) of the Portuguese authorities, that\r\neven on these terms provisions were not forthcoming; and important\r\noperations were constantly delayed or frustrated by the want of the\r\nnecessary subsistence for the troops.\r\n\r\nThe reader of the Duke's despatches will glean much of his character\r\nfrom the letters written from time to time to these persons; and,\r\nscattered through the extracts which form a part of this volume, will be\r\nfound characters of both Spaniards and Portuguese, (that is to say in\r\nthe civil service) that are not very flattering to the national vanity.\r\nWell may he say, in a letter to Mr. Villiers on the 25th of May 1811,\r\n\"No man can appreciate better than yourself the difficulties with which\r\nI have had to contend; but I believe you are not aware of all of them. I\r\npersevered in the system which I thought best, notwithstanding that it\r\nwas the opinion of every British officer in the country that I ought to\r\nembark the army; while, on the other hand, the Portuguese civil\r\nauthorities contended that the war ought to be maintained on the\r\nfrontier, for which they wanted not only physical force, but the means\r\nof providing for the force which they could produce in the field. I\r\nbelieve that nothing but _something worse than firmness could have\r\ncarried me through_ the nine months' discussion with these contending\r\nopinions. To this add that people in England were changing their\r\nopinions almost with the wind, and you will see that I had not much to\r\nlook to, excepting myself.\"\r\n\r\nNothing could be more ignoble than the conduct of the people of Lisbon\r\nas to the billeting of the very soldiers who had saved them from the\r\nenemy. On one occasion the Duke writes to order his wine, &c. to be\r\nremoved from the house of a Signor Bandeira, and to have a house taken\r\nfor him, \"in order,\" he says, \"to mortify the people of Lisbon a little\r\nas to their conduct about billets. I am slaving like a negro for them: I\r\nhave saved the people, in Lisbon particularly, from the enemy, and I\r\ntake nothing from them, while they continually torment me with their\r\nfrivolous complaints on subjects on which they ought to have no feeling.\r\n* * I shall not be sorry if the government and principal people of\r\nLisbon know the reason why I take this house; viz., that I will not lay\r\nmyself under obligation to any of them.\" Strong language this, from a\r\nman of the Duke's impassible temperament. But unfortunately there was\r\ntoo much reason for this, and indeed, for much more animadversion on\r\nmore serious subjects, as regards many of the chief men of the\r\nPeninsula.\r\n\r\nNor were these the only annoyances he had to submit to. In the early\r\npart of his service in the Peninsula, before he had by his brilliant\r\ndeeds utterly silenced for the present and the future the cavillings of\r\nthe envious, he was subjected to repeated attacks in Parliament, to\r\npredictions of failure--to everything in short that was calculated to\r\ndispirit him and his army. The government, too, seemed hardly to have\r\n\"backed him up\" as they might have done, either with respect to the\r\nforce at his command, or their approval of his plans.\r\n\r\nNor were these attacks confined to parliament. On the 2nd January, 1810,\r\nwriting to Mr. Villiers, he says: \"You see the dash the Common Council\r\nhave made at me![1] I act with a sword hanging over me, which will fall\r\nupon me, whatever may be the result of affairs here; but they may do\r\nwhat they please,--I shall not give up the game here as long as it can\r\nbe played.\" Again, two months after, he refers to what has passed in\r\nparliament about him, and observes, \"that it does not give him one\r\nmoment's concern.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: They had voted an address for an inquiry into his conduct.]\r\n\r\nThroughout the dispatches and letters will be found very interesting\r\npassages referring to all these difficulties in his path.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1819, the British again advanced into Spain, and on the 21st of\r\nJune completely defeated the French at Vittoria, for which the thanks of\r\nparliament were voted on the 8th of July. What was felt in another\r\nquarter will be seen by the following letter written by the Prince\r\nRegent.\r\n\r\n_To Field Marshal the Marquis of Wellington, K.G._\r\n\r\nCarlton House, 3rd July, 1818\r\n\r\nMy dear Lord.--Your glorious conduct is beyond all human praise, and far\r\nabove my reward. I know no language the world affords worthy to express\r\nit.\r\n\r\nI feel I have nothing left to say, but most devoutly to offer up my\r\nprayer of gratitude to Providence, that it has, in its Omnipotent\r\nbounty, blessed my country and myself with such a general. You have sent\r\nme, amongst the trophies of your unrivalled fame, the staff of a French\r\nmarshal, and I send you in return that of England.\r\n\r\nThe British army will hail it with rapturous enthusiasm, while the whole\r\nuniverse will acknowledge those valorous exploits which have so\r\nimperiously rallied for it.\r\n\r\nThat uninterrupted health and still increasing laurels may continue to\r\ncrown you through a glorious and long career of life, are the never\r\nceasing and most ardent wishes of, my dear lord, your very sincere and\r\nfaithful friend.\r\n\r\nG.P.R.\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd, the Regency of Spain gave the Marquis of Wellington the\r\nestate of the Soto de Roma, in Granada, \"in the name of the Spanish\r\nnation, in testimony of its sincere gratitude.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 28th of July, the French, under Marshal Soult, having re-entered\r\nSpain, the battle of Sovauren was fought; and on the 8th of September,\r\nSt. Sebastian fell. On the 7th of October, the passage of the Bidassoa\r\nwas effected; and on the 10th of November, the whole of the army\r\ndescended into France. Other battles ensued; and on the 10th of April,\r\n1814, was fought the final battle of Toulouse, which ended the war.\r\n\r\nOn the 3rd of May, the illustrious commander was advanced in the\r\npeerage by the titles of Marquis of Douro and Duke of Wellington; and,\r\nsoon after, a grant of £400,000 was voted him by parliament. He arrived\r\nin England on the 23rd of June, and on the next day proceeded to\r\nPortsmouth to the Prince Regent, who was there with the allied monarchs.\r\n\r\nA few days afterwards, a scene took place in the House of Lords--when\r\nfor the first time the Duke took his seat there--enough to make a\r\nnation's heart beat with gratitude, pride, and exultation. It is thus\r\ndescribed:\r\n\r\n\"On the 28th of June, shortly after 3 o'clock, the Lord Chancellor\r\nhaving taken his seat, the Duke of Wellington was introduced, supported\r\nby the Dukes of Richmond and Beaufort, in military uniform, and in their\r\nducal robes. Being arrived in the body of the House, the Duke made the\r\nusual obeisance to the Lord Chancellor, and shewed his patent and right\r\nof summons: these noblemen then approached the table, where his Grace's\r\nvarious patents, as baron and viscount, earl, marquis, and lastly as\r\nduke, were each read by the clerks. The oaths were then administered,\r\nand the Test Rolls were signed by him. He then, accompanied by his noble\r\nsupporters, took his seat on the dukes' bench, and saluted the house in\r\nthe usual manner, by rising, taking off his hat, and bowing\r\nrespectfully. The Lord Chancellor then rose, and, pursuant to their\r\nlordships' orders, addressed his Grace:--\r\n\r\n\"My Lord Duke of Wellington,--I have received the commands of this\r\nhouse, which I am persuaded has witnessed with infinite satisfaction\r\nyour Grace's personal introduction to this august assembly, to return\r\nyour grace the thanks and acknowledgments of this house, for your great\r\nand eminent services to your king and country.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the execution of these commands, I cannot forbear to call the\r\nespecial attention of all who hear me to a fact in your Grace's life,\r\nsingular, I believe, in the history of the country, and infinitely\r\nhonourable to your Grace, that you have manifested, upon your first\r\nentrance into this house, your right, under various grants, to all the\r\ndignities in the peerage of this realm which the crown can confer. These\r\ndignities have been conferred at various periods, but in the short\r\ncompass of little more than four years, for great public services,\r\noccurring in rapid succession, claiming the favour of the crown,\r\ninfluenced by its sense of justice to your grace and the country; and on\r\nno one occasion in which the crown has thus rewarded your merits have\r\nthe Houses of Parliament been inattentive to your demands upon the\r\ngratitude of the country. Upon all such occasions, they have offered to\r\nyour Grace their acknowledgments and thanks, the highest honours they\r\ncould bestow.\"\r\n\r\n\"I decline all attempts to state your Grace's eminent merits in your\r\nmilitary character; to represent those brilliant actions, those\r\nillustrious achievements, which have attached immortality to the name of\r\nWellington, and which have given to this country a degree of glory\r\nunexampled in the annals of this kingdom. In thus acting, I believe I\r\nbest consult the feelings which evince your Grace's title to the\r\ncharacter of a truly great and illustrious man.\"\r\n\r\n\"My duty to this house cannot but make me most anxious not to fall\r\nshort of the expectation which the house may have formed as to the\r\nexecution of what may have been committed to me on this great occasion;\r\nbut the most anxious consideration which I have given to the nature of\r\nthat duty has convinced me that I cannot more effectually do justice to\r\nthe judgment of the house, than by referring your Grace to the terms and\r\nlanguage in which the house has so repeatedly expressed its own sense of\r\nthe distinguished and consummate wisdom and judgment, the skill and\r\nability, the prompt energy, the indefatigable exertion, perseverance,\r\nthe fortitude and the valour, by which the victories of Vimeiro,\r\nTalavera, Salamanca and Vittoria were achieved; by which the sieges of\r\nCiudad Rodrigo and Badajoz were gloriously terminated; by which the\r\ndeliverance of Portugal was effectuated; by which the ever memorable\r\nestablishment of the allied armies on the frontiers of France was\r\naccomplished; armies pushing forward, in the glory of victory at Orthes,\r\nto the occupation of Bordeaux. These achievements, in their immediate\r\nconsequence infinitely beneficial to the common cause, have, in their\r\nfinal results, secured the peace, prosperity, and glory of this country;\r\nwhilst your Grace's example has animated to great exertions the other\r\nnations of Europe, exertions rescuing them from tyranny, and restoring\r\nthem to independence, by which there has been ultimately established\r\namong the nations of Europe that balance of power which, giving\r\nsufficient strength to every nation, provides that no nation shall be\r\ntoo strong. I presume not to trespass upon the house by representing the\r\npersonal satisfaction which I have derived from being the honoured\r\ninstrument of conveying to your Grace the acknowledgments and thanks of\r\nthis house upon every occasion upon which they have been offered to your\r\nGrace, or by endeavouring to represent the infinite gratification which\r\nI enjoy in thus offering, on behalf of the house, on this day, to your\r\nGrace in person, those acknowledgments and those thanks. Your Grace is\r\nnow called to aid hereafter, by your wisdom and judgment, the great\r\ncouncil of that nation, to the peace, prosperity, and glory of which\r\nyour Grace has already so essentially contributed; and to tender your\r\nGrace, now taking your seat in this house, in obedience to its commands,\r\nthe thanks of the house in the words of its resolution--That the thanks\r\nof this house be given to Field-marshal the Duke of Wellington, on his\r\nreturn from his command abroad, for his eminent and unremitting services\r\nto his majesty and the public.\"\r\n\r\nThe Duke answered the address to the following effect:--\r\n\r\n\"My lords, I have to perform a duty to which I feel myself very\r\ninadequate, to return your lordships my thanks for the fresh mark of\r\nyour approbation of my conduct and of your favour.\"\r\n\r\n\"I assure your lordships that I am entirely overcome by the honours\r\nwhich have been conferred upon me; and by the favour with which I have\r\nbeen received in this country by the Prince Regent, by your lordships,\r\nand by the public.\"\r\n\r\n\"In truth, my lords, when I reflect upon the advantages which I enjoyed\r\nin the confidence reposed in me, and the support afforded by the\r\ngovernment, and by his royal highness the commander-in-chief, in the\r\ncordial assistance which I invariably received upon all occasions from\r\nmy gallant friends, the general officers of the army, who are an honour\r\nto their country, the gallantry and discipline of the troops, and in the\r\nmanner in which I was encouraged and excited to exertion by the\r\nprotection and gracious favour of the prince, I cannot but consider\r\nthat, however great the difficulties with which I had to contend, the\r\nmeans to contend with them were equal to overcome them; and I am\r\napprehensive that I shall not be found so deserving of your favour as I\r\nwish.\"\r\n\r\n\"If, however, my merit is not great, my gratitude is unbounded; and I\r\ncan only assure your lordships, that you will always find me ready to\r\nserve his majesty to the utmost of my ability in any capacity in which\r\nmy services can be at all useful to this great country.\"\r\n\r\nHis Grace then retired to unrobe; he wore a field-marshal's uniform,\r\nwith his insignia of the garter. On his return into the House he sat for\r\na few minutes on the extremity of one of the benches, and then retired\r\nfor the evening.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the pecuniary remuneration voted by Parliament to the\r\nDuke of Wellington for his distinguished services, the House of Commons\r\nresolved to pay him the highest tribute of respect and applause that it\r\nwas possible to bestow on a subject, that of its thanks, accompanied\r\nwith a deputation of its members to congratulate him on his return to\r\nthis country Lord Castlereagh rose in the house, on the 27th June, to\r\nmake a motion for this purpose, which was unanimously agreed to; and a\r\ncommittee was appointed to wait on his Grace, to know what time he would\r\nname for receiving the congratulations of the house. Lord Castlereagh\r\nhaving reported from the committee that it was the Duke's desire to\r\nexpress to the house his answer in person, the following day, July 1,\r\nwas appointed for the solemnity.\r\n\r\nAt about a quarter before five, the speaker being dressed in his\r\nofficial robes, and the house being crowded with members, some of them\r\nin military and naval uniforms, and many of them in the court dresses in\r\nwhich they had been attending the speaker with an address to the Prince\r\nRegent on the peace, the house was acquainted that the Duke of\r\nWellington was in waiting. His admission being resolved on, and a chair\r\nbeing set for him on the left hand of the bar towards the middle of the\r\nhouse, his Grace entered, making his obeisances, while all the members\r\nrose from their seats. The speaker then informing him that a chair was\r\nplaced for his repose, he sat down in it for some time, covered, the\r\nserjeant standing on his right hand with the mace grounded, and the\r\nmembers resumed their seats. He then rose, and spoke, uncovered, to the\r\nfollowing effect:--\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Speaker,--I was anxious to be permitted to attend this house, in\r\norder to return my thanks in person for the honour they have done me in\r\ndeputing a committee of their members to congratulate me on my return to\r\nthis country; and this, after the house had animated my exertions by\r\ntheir applause upon every occasion which appeared to merit their\r\napprobation, and after they had filled up the measure of their favours\r\nby conferring upon me, upon the recommendation of the Prince Regent, the\r\nnoblest gift that any subject had ever received.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope it will not be deemed presumptuous in me to take this\r\nopportunity of expressing my admiration of the great efforts made by\r\nthis house and the country at a moment of unexampled pressure and\r\ndifficulty, in order to support the great scale of operations by which\r\nthe contest was brought to so fortunate a termination. By the wise\r\npolicy of parliament, the government was enabled to give the necessary\r\nsupport to the operations which were carried on under my direction; and\r\nI was encouraged by the confidence reposed in me by his majesty's\r\nministers, and by the commander-in-chief, by the gracious favour of his\r\nroyal highness the Prince Regent, and by the reliance which I had on the\r\nsupport of my gallant friends the general officers of the army, and on\r\nthe bravery of the officers and troops, to carry on the operations in\r\nsuch a manner as to acquire for me those marks of the approbation of\r\nthis house, for which I have now the honor to make my humble\r\nacknowledgments.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir, it is impossible for me to express the gratitude which I feel; I\r\ncan only assure the house that I shall always be ready to serve his\r\nmajesty in any capacity in which my services can be deemed useful, with\r\nthe same zeal for my country which has already acquired for me the\r\napprobation of this house.\"\r\n\r\nThis speech was received with loud cheers, at the end of which the\r\nspeaker, who had sat covered during its delivery, rose, and thus\r\naddressed his Grace:--\r\n\r\n\"My Lord,--Since last I had the honour of addressing you from this\r\nplace, a series of eventful years has elapsed; but none without some\r\nmark and note of your rising glory.\"\r\n\r\n\"The military triumphs which your valour has achieved upon the banks of\r\nthe Douro and the Tagus, of the Ebro and the Garonne, have called forth\r\nthe spontaneous shouts of admiring nations. Those triumphs it is\r\nneedless on this day to recount. Their names have been written by your\r\nconquering sword in the annals of Europe, and we hand them down with\r\nexultation to our children's children.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not, however, the grandeur of military success which has alone\r\nfixed our admiration, or commanded our applause; it has been that\r\ngenerous and lofty spirit which inspired your troops with unbounded\r\nconfidence, and taught them to know that the day of battle was always a\r\nday of victory; that moral courage and enduring fortitude, which, in\r\nperilous times, when gloom and doubt had beset ordinary minds, stood\r\nnevertheless unshaken; and that ascendancy of character, which, uniting\r\nthe energies of jealous and rival nations, enabled you to wield at will\r\nthe fate of mighty empires.\"\r\n\r\n\"For the repeated thanks and grants bestowed upon you by this house,\r\nin gratitude for your many and eminent services, you have thought fit\r\nthis day to offer us your acknowledgments: but this nation well knows\r\nthat it is still largely your debtor. It owes to you the proud\r\nsatisfaction, that, amidst the constellation of great and illustrious\r\nwarriors who have recently visited our country, we could present to them\r\na leader of our own, to whom all, by common acclamation, conceded the\r\npre-eminence; and when the will of heaven, and the common destinies of\r\nour nature, shall have swept away the present generation, you will have\r\nleft your great name and example as an imperishable monument, exciting\r\nothers to like deeds of glory, and serving at once to adorn, defend, and\r\nperpetuate the existence of this country amongst the ruling nations of\r\nthe earth.\"\r\n\r\n\"It now remains only that we congratulate your Grace upon the high and\r\nimportant mission on which you are about to proceed, and we doubt not\r\nthat the same splendid talents, so conspicuous in war, will maintain,\r\nwith equal authority, firmness, and temper, our national honour and\r\ninterests in peace.\"\r\n\r\nHis Grace then withdrew, making the same obeisance as when he entered;\r\nand all the members rising again, he was reconducted by the serjeant to\r\nthe door of the house.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th July, when the Prince Regent went in state to St. Paul's, to\r\nreturn public thanksgiving for the restoration of peace, the Duke of\r\nWellington was seated on the right hand of his royal highness, with the\r\nsword of state before him.\r\n\r\nOn the 9th, the Duke was entertained by the corporation of London in\r\nthe Guildhall, and previously to the banquet he was presented with a\r\nsword of exquisite workmanship, which had been voted him by the common\r\ncouncil. Four years and a half before, as will be remembered, the Duke\r\nwas publicly attacked by this same common council, and he then says, \"I\r\nact with a sword hanging over me.\" During the interval, the common\r\ncouncil had learned to apply their sword to a better purpose. In fact,\r\nall ranks, from the highest to the lowest, now combined to do honour to\r\nthe Duke of Wellington.\r\n\r\nWhen Buonaparte landed from Elba, the Duke was at Vienna, the\r\nrepresentative of this country at the congress of the allied sovereigns.\r\nFrom that point he wrote to Lord Castlereagh, stating the interview he\r\nhad had with the sovereigns on the subject of Buonaparte's movements,\r\nand adding that he had no doubt whatever of their support, and their\r\ndetermination not to lay down their arms until Buonaparte was put down.\r\nA numerous force was assembled, and of the whole, whether British or\r\nforeign, in Belgium (already seen to be the point on which the fate of\r\nNapoleon would be decided), the Duke of Wellington assumed the command.\r\nThe campaign was closed by the decisive victory of Waterloo, on the 18th\r\nJune, followed by the abdication of Napoleon, and the convention of\r\nParis.\r\n\r\nDuring the subsequent proceedings, the Duke of Wellington was\r\ninstrumental in stopping the savage revenge of Blucher and the\r\nPrussians, who were on the point of destroying the beautiful bridge on\r\nthe Seine, called the bridge of Jena, because it had been named in\r\nhonour of Napoleon's victory over the Prussians at that place.\r\n\r\nThe Duke, however, did not interpose to prevent another act, which was\r\none of real justice, the restoration to the several nations of the\r\nvarious works of art of which they had been plundered by the French. It\r\nwas in answer to complaints of his conduct in this respect that the Duke\r\nwrote his letter to Castlereagh, in which he said--\"It is to be wished,\r\nas well for the happiness of France as of the world, that if the French\r\npeople are not already convinced that Europe is too strong for them,\r\nthey may be made to feel that, however extensive for a time their\r\ntemporary and partial advantages over one or more of the powers of\r\nEurope may be, the day of retribution must at length come. According to\r\nmy feelings, then, it would not only be unjust in the sovereigns to\r\ngratify the French people, but the sacrifice they would make would be\r\nimpolitic, as it would deprive them of the opportunity of giving the\r\nFrench nation a _great moral lesson_.\"\r\n\r\nThe thanks of both houses were voted to the Duke for the battle of\r\nWaterloo, and an additional grant of 200,000 l.\r\n\r\nFrom the year 1815 until 1823 the Duke of Wellington's name rarely\r\nappears in connexion with any public transactions, with the exception\r\nthat in December, 1818, he was appointed Master-General of the Ordnance,\r\nan office which he continued to fill for some years.\r\n\r\nIn 1819 he made one speech in parliament in which his declared his\r\nbelief that Roman Catholic Emancipation was impossible, unless there\r\ncould be a proper security for the Protestant religion, which he\r\ndoubted.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1823, on the appointment of Mr. Canning to be Secretary for\r\nForeign Affairs, Duke of Wellington was named as the Plenipotentiary of\r\nthe King of Great Britain at the Congress of Verona. It was supposed\r\nthat the subject matter of the discussions of the sovereigns at that\r\ncongress would be the relations of Russia and Turkey. On the Duke's\r\narrival at Paris, however, he found that Spain would form the main\r\nsubject. He wrote back for fresh instructions, and Mr. Canning's answer\r\ndistinctly stated that should France attempt to interfere in Spain\r\neither by force or by menace, he was to instruct the Duke \"frankly and\r\nperemptorily to declare, that to any such interference, come what may,\r\nhis majesty will not be a party.\"\r\n\r\nThe words \"frankly and peremptorily\" could not have been better chosen,\r\nor more agreeable to the character of the Duke. He stuck simply and\r\nstedfastly to his text throughout the negotiations, and when at last, in\r\nconsequence of the state of affairs in Spain, the three great powers\r\nagreed to withdraw their ministers from Madrid, the Duke told them he\r\nshould not withdraw ours but leave him there in the hope of allaying the\r\nirritation which the measures of the others were calculated to produce.\r\n\r\nThe Duke returned to Parts in December, and found the French not\r\nindisposed to some arrangement. When it subsequently became necessary to\r\nsend a special communication to the Spanish government, a mark of\r\nrespect was paid by Mr. Canning to the Duke of Wellington, more\r\ngratifying perhaps to him than his titles or honours. The desire of the\r\nBritish Government was to attach a special character of friendliness to\r\nthis communication, and for that purpose the Duke of Wellington was\r\nrequested to make it. This course was taken because it was believed that\r\nthe private opinions of a man who had conferred such distinguished\r\nbenefits on Spain, and who had been on terms of personal intercourse and\r\nfriendship with many of the leading men, would be listened to with more\r\ndeference than even an official communication. It is unnecessary to\r\npursue this subject farther, as the Duke of Wellington's connexion with\r\nit ceased; except that he gave, in the House of Lords, on the 24th of\r\nApril, a full explanation of his share in the proceedings.\r\n\r\nIn 1826, the Duke having been appointed ambassador to St. Petersburgh,\r\non the anniversary of the entrance of the allied army into Paris under\r\nhis command, the Emperor Nicholas addressed a letter to him, in which he\r\ntold him that in order to testify to him his particular esteem for his\r\ngreat qualities and for the distinguished services he had rendered to\r\nthe whole of Europe, he had given orders that the Smolensko regiment of\r\ninfantry, formed by Peter the Great, and one of the most distinguished\r\nof his army, which was formerly under the Duke's command in France,\r\nshould thenceforward be called the Duke of Wellington's regiment.\r\n\r\nIn 1827, on the death of the Duke of York, the public mind pointed to\r\nthe Duke of Wellington as the fit successor of his royal highness in the\r\nimportant post of Commander-in-Chief, and he was immediately appointed.\r\nThe Duke held this office until the appointment of Mr. Canning to be\r\nPrime Minister, when he resigned it, and also the Master-Generalship of\r\nthe Ordnance.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances attending this resignation must of course hold a\r\nprominent place in any memoir of the Duke. But there were personal\r\nmatters mixed up in the affair, which make it necessary to enter into it\r\nat some length, for the better understanding of his Grace's character.\r\n\r\nOn the death of the Earl of Liverpool, in the beginning of the year\r\n1827, the king called on Mr. Canning to form an administration. As Mr.\r\nCanning had all along advocated Roman Catholic Emancipation, and as the\r\ncabinet of Lord Liverpool had firmly opposed that measure, it became a\r\nquestion how far the premiership of Mr. Canning would compromise the\r\nposition of those who had hitherto acted with him in the cabinet of Lord\r\nLiverpool. The question very soon received a practical solution, by the\r\nsimultaneous (though not concerted) resignation of six of the most\r\ninfluential members of the government, including the Duke of Wellington.\r\n\r\nThe political friends of Mr. Canning, and those of his opponents with\r\nwhom he was agreed on the Roman Catholic question, concurred in\r\nrepresenting this act of the seceding ministers as a cabal against Mr.\r\nCanning; and the Duke of Wellington, more especially, was made the\r\nsubject of most unsparing abuse. The ground of this was that he had not\r\ncontented himself with resigning the office he held directly under the\r\ngovernment, but had also resigned the command of the army, an office\r\nunconnected with politics. This was supposed to indicate some special\r\ndetermination to crush Mr. Canning.\r\n\r\nNow with regard to the motives of the Duke on this occasion all men will\r\nform their own opinion, not so much with reference to facts, as to their\r\npolitical feelings. It may however be fairly laid down as a principle\r\nthat where admitted facts sufficiently supply an explanation of a man's\r\nconduct, all reference to motives are unnecessary; and the more so\r\nbecause in all cases, however strong suspicion or presumptive evidence\r\nmay be, the truth with regard to a man's motives must ever remain locked\r\nin his own breast. The open, manly and fearless character of the Duke\r\nwould however, except in the heated imagination of partisans, almost\r\npreclude suspicion in the first instance.\r\n\r\nBut let us turn to the facts, as stated in the house of lords on the 2nd\r\nof May, when the peers met after the Easter recess. On the 10th of April\r\nMr. Canning wrote to the Duke of Wellington the following letter:--\r\n\r\n   _To his Grace the Duke of Wellington._\r\n\r\n   Foreign Office, April 10, 6 P.M., 1827.\r\n\r\n   My dear Duke of Wellington,--The king has, at\r\n   an audience from which I have just returned, been\r\n   graciously pleased to signify to me his majesty's commands,\r\n   to lay before his majesty, with as little loss as\r\n   time as possible, a plan of arrangements for the re-construction of\r\n   the administration. In executing these commands it will be as much my\r\n   own wish, as it is my duty to his majesty, to adhere to the principles\r\n   upon which Lord Liverpool's government has so long acted together. I\r\n   need not add how essentially the accomplishment must depend upon your\r\n   Grace's continuing a member of the cabinet.\r\n\r\n   Ever, my dear Duke of Wellington, your Grace's sincere and faithful\r\n   servant,\r\n\r\n   GEORGE CANNING.\r\n\r\nTo this the Duke of Wellington replied in a characteristic way:--\r\n\r\n   _To the Right Hon. George Canning._\r\n\r\n   London, April 10, 1827.\r\n\r\n   My dear Mr. Canning,--I have received your letter of\r\n   this evening, informing me that the king had desired\r\n   you to lay before his majesty a plan for the re-construction\r\n   of the administration; and that, in executing\r\n   these commands, it was your wish to adhere to the\r\n   principles on which Lord Liverpool's government had\r\n   so long acted together. I anxiously desire to be able\r\n   to serve his majesty, as I have done hitherto in his\r\n   cabinet, with the same colleagues. But before I can\r\n   give an answer to your obliging proposition, I should\r\n   wish to know who the person is you intend to propose\r\n   to his majesty as the head of the government?\r\n\r\n   Ever, my dear Mr. Canning, yours most sincerely,\r\n\r\n   WELLINGTON.\r\n\r\nOn the next day came the following from Mr. Canning:--\r\n\r\n   _To his Grace the Duke of Wellington._\r\n\r\n   Foreign Office, April 11, 1897.\r\n\r\n   My dear Duke of Wellington,--I believed it to be\r\n   so generally understood, that the king usually intrusts\r\n   the formation of an administration to the individual\r\n   whom it is his majesty's gracious intention to place at\r\n   the head of it; that it did not occur to me, when I\r\n   communicated to your Grace yesterday the commands\r\n   which I had just received from his majesty, to add, that,\r\n   in the present instance, his majesty does not intend to\r\n   depart from the usual course of proceeding on such\r\n   occasions. I am sorry to have delayed some hours this\r\n   answer to your Grace's letter; but from the nature of\r\n   the subject, I did not like to forward it without having\r\n   previously submitted it (together with your Grace's\r\n   letter) to his Majesty.\r\n\r\n   Ever, my dear Duke of Wellington, your Grace's\r\n   sincere and faithful servant,\r\n\r\n   GEORGE CANNING.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, on the evening of the same day, the Duke wrote thus to Mr.\r\nCanning.--\r\n\r\n   London, April 11, 1837.\r\n\r\n   My dear Mr. Canning,--I have received your letter\r\n   of this day, and I did not understand the one of yesterday\r\n   evening as you explained it to me. I understood\r\n   from yourself that you had in contemplation another\r\n   arrangement, and I do not believe that the practice to\r\n   which you refer has been so invariable as to enable me to affix a\r\n   meaning to your letter which its words did not, in my opinion, convey. I\r\n   trust that you will have experienced no inconvenience from the delay of\r\n   this answer, which I assure you has been occasioned by my desire to\r\n   discover a mode by which I could continue united with my recent\r\n   colleagues.--I sincerely wish that I could bring my mind to the\r\n   conclusion that, with the best intentions on your part, your government\r\n   could be conducted practically on the principles of that of Lord\r\n   Liverpool; that it would be generally so considered; or that it would be\r\n   adequate to meet our difficulties, in a manner satisfactory to the king,\r\n   or conducive to the interests of the country. As, however, I am\r\n   convinced that these principles must be abandoned eventually, that all\r\n   our measures would be viewed with suspicion by the usual supporters of\r\n   the government; that I could do no good in the cabinet; and that at last\r\n   I should be obliged to separate myself from it, at the moment at which\r\n   such separation would be more inconvenient to the king's service than it\r\n   can be at present, I must beg you to request his majesty to excuse me\r\n   from belonging to his councils. Ever, my dear Mr. Canning, yours most\r\n   sincerely,\r\n\r\n   WELLINGTON.\r\n\r\nThis closed the correspondence; and it is needless to add that the Duke\r\ncontinued to hold aloof from the new administration.\r\n\r\nThe Duke's explanation in the House of Lords related to two branches of\r\ncharge. The first was a charge of want of personal courtesy to Mr.\r\nCanning, as exhibited in the foregoing correspondence; the second was a\r\ngeneral charge of hostility to the new premier, founded on personal\r\njealousy, and on every other ground, probable or improbable, which the\r\nmalice of party could suggest. The Duke began by observing, that the\r\nHouse of Lords was scarcely the proper place to enter on such subjects,\r\nbut that his only excuse was the necessity of vindicating his character\r\nagainst what had been said in another place, to say nothing of the\r\nmanner in which he had been treated by a corrupt press, which if not in\r\nthe pay, was under the control of the government. He then proceeded to\r\nmeet the first charge, that of personal discourtesy. It was said, that\r\nhis asking in reply to Mr. Canning's first letter, \"who was to be at the\r\nhead of the new government?\" was intended as an insult to Mr. Canning.\r\nThis he denied. The letter of Mr. Canning, he said gave no information\r\nwho were to form the new cabinet, or what members of the old one had\r\nresigned, or were expected to resign. Nor was he invited, as he found\r\nthe other ministers had been, to receive personal explanations on the\r\nsubject. Under those circumstances the inquiry was made. But that was\r\nnot the first communication that had passed between them on the subject.\r\nEarly in the month of April, continued the Duke, he had had a\r\nconversation with Mr. Canning, in which, anticipating the possibility of\r\nhis being called upon to reconstruct the government, one of his plans\r\nwas to recommend that Mr. Robinson (now the Earl of Ripon) should be\r\nraised to the peerage and be made premier. Of this plan the Duke at the\r\ntime approved, and it was with this in his mind that he wrote the first\r\nanswer, which gave Mr. Canning so much offence. Precedent, also, he\r\ncontended, was against Mr. Canning; for it appeared that in 1812, when\r\nLord Liverpool, by command of the Prince Regent, waited on Mr. Canning,\r\nto know whether he would form part of the proposed administration, the\r\nfirst question Mr. Canning asked of the noble earl (then in the same\r\nposition Mr. Canning was in now) was, \"who was to be at the head of the\r\nnew administration?\" The Duke's letter was written on the 10th, and Mr.\r\nCanning only kissed hands as minister on the 12th; so that, even in that\r\npoint of view, the Duke's question was, he contended, necessary.\r\n\r\nIt may be said that there is enough on the face of this communication to\r\nshow that the Duke of Wellington took a narrow, and, so to speak,\r\ntechnical, view of the relative positions of himself and Mr. Canning;\r\nthat the latter expected a more conventional and generous construction\r\nof his position and proposal from one with whom he was on terms of\r\nintimate friendship.\r\n\r\nIn answer to this, it may be as well to remind the reader that, where\r\nthe slightest movements of public men may be construed into a compromise\r\nof public principles, a rigid attention to etiquette becomes a matter of\r\nduty. Many acts of the Duke of Wellington, not merely as a civilian, but\r\neven as a military commander, have been misjudged, because this obvious\r\nprinciple has been overlooked.\r\n\r\nIn answer to the second charge--that of hostility to the new\r\nadministration on personal grounds--the Duke referred to the known\r\nopinions of Mr. Canning on the Catholic question. How could he be in\r\noffice under a minister whom he must oppose on, at least, one vital\r\nquestion of domestic policy? How could he give the right honourable\r\ngentleman that fair support which one member of a cabinet had a right to\r\nexpect from another? The principles of the new government could not be\r\nthose of that of the Earl of Liverpool. The principle of the latter was\r\nto maintain the existing laws; of the former, to change them in a\r\nfundamental particular. The absurd calumny that he had threatened the\r\nking to resign, unless he were prepared to make him prime minister,\r\nhardly deserved an answer; and then came his celebrated _nolo\r\nepiscopari_ speech, which created against him in a year after, so much\r\nridicule and rancour. He said--\"Was it likely that he would resign the\r\noffice of commander-in-chief,\" a situation so consonant to his feelings\r\nand his habits, \"for the mere empty ambition of being placed at the head\r\nof the government. I know,\" continued the Duke, \"I am disqualified for\r\nany such office; and I, therefore, say, that, feeling as I do with\r\nrespect to the situation which I recently filled at the head of the\r\narmy; liking it as I did from the opportunity it gave me to improve the\r\ncondition of my old comrades in arms; knowing my own capacity for\r\nfilling that office, and my incapacity for filling the post of first\r\nminister, I should have been mad, and worse than mad, if I had ever\r\nentertained the insane project which certain individuals, for their own\r\nbase purposes, have imputed to me.\"\r\n\r\nHis reason for retiring from the command of the army was founded on the\r\npeculiar circumstances of his dispute with Mr. Canning. \"No political\r\nopinions would have prevented him,\" he said, \"under ordinary\r\ncircumstances, from continuing either at the Horse Guards or at the head\r\nof the army in the field; but, from the tone and tenor of the\r\ncommunication he had received from his majesty; from the nature of the\r\ninvitation to join the administration, contained in Mr. Canning's post\r\nletter, and from the contents of the last letter he received from Mr.\r\nCanning, by his majesty's commands, he saw it would be impossible to\r\ncontinue his relations with that gentlemen, either with service to the\r\ncountry or credit to himself. His resolution had been adopted after the\r\nmost mature deliberation.\"\r\n\r\nThe foregoing is the substance of the Duke of Wellington's explanation\r\nof his own share in the general resignation of the chief members of Lord\r\nLiverpool's cabinet.\r\n\r\nAnother circumstance occurred a few days afterwards, which still further\r\nincreased the public belief that there was a serious quarrel between the\r\nDuke and the new premier. The former moved an amendment in committee on\r\nthe corn bill, which had the effect of defeating the new government on\r\nthat measure. This was regarded as an act of hostility on the part of\r\nthe Duke, and, shortly after, a correspondence was made public between\r\nhim and Mr. Huskisson, then President of the Board of Trade, in which\r\nit appeared clear that the Duke had moved the amendment in the belief\r\nthat the government had agreed to it through Mr. Huskisson, and equally\r\nclear that the Duke had been mistaken. There were not wanting those who\r\nasserted roundly that the Duke had taken advantage of an ambiguity in\r\nMr. Huskisson's letters, in order to have a pretext for inflicting this\r\ninjury on the government. And, unhappily, Mr. Canning himself, carried\r\nout of parliamentary decorum by an irritability of temper, springing\r\nfrom the difficulties of his position and from his advancing illness,\r\nwent so far as publicly to declare that the Duke of Wellington, great\r\nman as he was, had been but in instrument in the hands of others.\r\nHistory, he said, afforded parallel the actions of other great men.\r\n\r\nThe Duke maintained a dignified silence with respect to this attack;\r\nbut, in the following year, long after Mr. Canning's death, and when he\r\nhad himself become prime minister, he took an opportunity of\r\ndisclaiming, in strong language, the existance of any personal hostility\r\non his part to the deceased statesman.\r\n\r\nOn the formation of the new administration, under Lord Goderich, the\r\nDuke of Wellington resumed the command of the army. This was on August\r\nthe 27th.\r\n\r\nEarly in January, 1828, this administration fell to pieces, and the Duke\r\nof Wellington was called on by the king to form another. He was at first\r\nreluctant to do so, but ultimately gave way. He rallied round him Mr.\r\nPeel, and most of those who had seceded on the accession of Mr. Canning;\r\nso that his administration was nearly identical with that of the Earl of\r\nLiverpool, except that Mr. Huskisson and some two or three of the\r\ncoalitionary whigs, were retained.\r\n\r\nIn the following May, these were got rid of. Mr. Huskisson gave a vote\r\non the East Retford Bill, adverse to those of his colleagues; and on\r\nleaving the house, sat down (at two in the morning), and wrote a letter\r\nto the Duke, which was construed into a positive resignation of office.\r\nAn amusing correspondence took place between the two statesmen, Mr.\r\nHuskisson declaring he never meant to resign, and the Duke as positively\r\nadhering to his original construction of the first letter. Mr.\r\nHuskisson's place was filled up, and he resented that proceeding by\r\ndeclaring in the House of Commons his belief that he had been sacrificed\r\nas a peace-offering to gain the support of some of the old tories.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the Duke's share in this correspondence is highly\r\ncharacteristic; and it was in the course of negotiations for the return\r\nof Mr. Huskisson that the Duke uttered the sentence so often quoted of\r\nhim: \"It is no mistake; it can be no mistake; and it shall be no\r\nmistake!\" Strange to say, although the Duke's mode of proceeding to Mr.\r\nHuskisson was somewhat arbitrary, it gained him a sort of popularity, on\r\naccount of the firmness with which he stuck to his point. The laugh was\r\nfairly on his side; and many of the vessels in the Thames hoisted flags,\r\nand exhibited other signs of rejoicing at Mr. Huskisson's dismissal.\r\n\r\nOn his appointment to be Prime Minister, the Duke again resigned the\r\ncommand of the army (Feb. 14th).\r\n\r\nThe first important measure, during the Duke's administration, was the\r\nrepeal of the Test and Corporation Acts. In giving his support to that\r\nbill, the Duke met an argument, that it was a step towards Roman\r\nCatholic emancipation, by a declaration that, though he voted for the\r\nmeasure, no man could be a more determined opponent of those claims than\r\nhe; and he added, \"Until I see a great change in that question, I shall\r\ncertainly oppose it.\" In the June following, however, the commons having\r\nin the meanwhile passed a resolution indicating favour to emancipation,\r\nthe Duke declared that he looked on the question as one of expediency;\r\nand concluded his speech by recommending that the public mind should be\r\nallowed to rest. In the end, it might be possible to do something; for\r\nhe was most desirous of seeing the subject brought to an amicable\r\nconclusion.\r\n\r\nCauses altogether independent of parliamentary majorities or discussions\r\nhad in the mean time been at work, and had proposed this change in the\r\ntone of ministers. Mr. O'Connell, although a Catholic, had been returned\r\nto parliament as member for the county of Clare; and during the summer\r\nand autumn, the whole of the Catholic population had become so\r\norganized, under the Catholic Association, as seriously to threaten the\r\ncontinuance of the existing system in Ireland. These events produced\r\ntheir effects upon English statesmen on either side of the question; and\r\nthe more moderate of the Conservative party began to think that some\r\nconcession to the Catholics would be inevitable.\r\n\r\nStill, however, the government gave no sign of yielding. On the\r\ncontrary, a circumstance occurred, in the month of December, which led\r\nto an opposite inference. Dr. Curtis, a Roman Catholic prelate, who had\r\nbeen on terms of personal acquaintance with the Duke of Wellington at\r\nSalamanca, wrote a letter to him on the position of the Catholic\r\nquestion, to which the Duke wrote an answer, which seemed to deny all\r\nhope of a speedy settlement. It was immediately made public by Dr.\r\nCurtis through the Catholic Association. The effect of the letter was to\r\nmake that body redouble their efforts.\r\n\r\nIn a few days after, the Marquis of Anglesea, the lord lieutenant, who\r\nhad always been the avowed supporter of the Catholics, also addressed a\r\nletter in reply to one he received from Dr. Curtis, in which he gave the\r\nCatholics advice as to the best mode of proceeding in order to attain\r\nemancipation. This conduct on the part of the viceroy, together with the\r\nopen countenance he gave to the leading catholics in Dublin, gave the\r\nstrongest offence to the king, and amounted to such a breach of duty\r\nthat the Duke of Wellington was compelled to recall the marquis from\r\nIreland.\r\n\r\nThe public mind was now in the greatest perplexity. On the one hand, the\r\nstate of Ireland seemed to render some measure of concession inevitable,\r\nwhile on the other there was the letter to Dr. Curtis, and the dismissal\r\nof the lord lieutenant--facts which seemed to discountenance all hope.\r\n\r\nThe year 1829 was the most eventful in the civil career of the Duke of\r\nWellington. He had been throughout his life the opponent of Roman\r\nCatholic emancipation: he was now to come before the public in the new\r\ncharacter of a prime minister prepared to grant, as a measure of free\r\ngrace, that which he had hitherto denounced as inconsistent with the\r\nsafety of the Protestant constitution.\r\n\r\nUp to within a few days of the opening of parliament, however, the\r\ndesign of the government was wholly concealed, but in the speech from\r\nthe throne parliament was recommended to entertain the question. In the\r\ndebate on the address the Duke of Wellington announced it as the\r\nintention of the government to introduce a measure for the emancipation\r\nof the Catholics. And now arose a political storm almost unparalleled in\r\nthe history of party, from the effects of which we are scarcely yet\r\nrecovered.\r\n\r\nThe Duke and Mr. Peel were immediately made the objects of the most\r\nunrelenting hostility by the opponents of emancipation. Seeing the\r\nfavour in which the two statesmen are now held by their party, it would\r\nbe almost impossible to believe that such abusive language as was then\r\npoured forth could have been used towards them, were it not on record.\r\n\r\nThe Duke especially was charged with a treble treachery; to Mr. Canning,\r\non account of the transactions previously referred to; towards the\r\nProtestant party, of whom he had been the chosen leader, and whom he was\r\nabout to betray; and lastly a personal treachery in the concealment of\r\nhis design until the moment of execution, by which he prevented others\r\nfrom coming forward and taking the station he had abandoned, as leader\r\nof the opponents of emancipation.\r\n\r\nThe Duke's replies to all these charges will be found at length in the\r\nfollowing pages. But the charge of personal treachery was afterwards put\r\nin a shape which compelled the Duke of Wellington to take a very\r\ndifferent notice of it. The Earl of Winchelsea wrote a letter to the\r\nsecretary of King's College, in which, after adverting to the support\r\nwhich the Duke had given on Protestant principles to that institution,\r\nhe stated that he now believed that the Duke's conduct had been only a\r\nblind to the high church party, and that he was about, under the cloak\r\nof the Protestant religion, to carry into effect his insidious designs\r\nfor the infringement of our liberties, and the introduction of Popery\r\ninto every department of the state. This letter the Duke found himself\r\nbound to notice; but the earl refused to retract. A correspondence took\r\nplace, which ended in a duel. Neither party was hurt, and the earl\r\nsubsequently made a public apology for the original expressions.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile the Emancipation Bill was steadily progressing. On the\r\n19th of February, in introducing the bill for the suppression of\r\ndangerous associations, the Duke of Wellington declared that there had\r\nbeen no previous bargain or compact with the Roman Catholic party while\r\nthe Emancipation Bill was in the House of Commons. Short discussions\r\ntook place almost every night in the House of Lords upon its merits, in\r\nwhich whenever the Duke joined he did so with the greatest reluctance.\r\nAt length, on the 2nd of April, he moved the second reading of the bill\r\nin the House of Lords, in a speech which reflected credit upon him for\r\nmoral courage, if not for consistency.\r\n\r\nIn fact, great moral courage is one of the most striking features in the\r\ncharacter of the Duke of Wellington. Some of his supporters will doubt\r\nthis assertion; and will point to the Emancipation Act as a proof that\r\nthe Duke wanted the firmness to act up to his avowed principles. This\r\ninvolves a wrong assumption. It is one thing obstinately to adhere to an\r\nopinion in defiance of its impracticability: another to retract that\r\nopinion so soon as its impracticability is demonstrated. Whether the\r\nDuke was right or wrong in his opinions, no one will deny that it\r\nrequired great moral courage for him to stand up in the face of the\r\ncountry, braving the anger of his old associates, and declare that he\r\ncould no longer resist the force of public opinion.\r\n\r\nIt was in the course of the speech introducing the Emancipation Bill\r\nthat the Duke made his well-known declaration \"that he would sacrifice\r\nhis life to prevent one month of civil war.\"\r\n\r\nOne fruit of the angry passions excited during the progress of the\r\nEmancipation Bill was a series of prosecutions against the _Morning\r\nJournal_ for libels on the Duke of Wellington, the Lord Chancellor, and\r\nthe government collectively. These prosecutions were conducted with\r\nunusual acrimony by Sir James Scarlet, the Attorney-General; and the\r\nDuke of Wellington came in for a very considerable share of public\r\ncensure for having authorised such prosecutions. Probably the Duke\r\nintended to inflict another \"great moral lesson,\" as he has always set\r\nhis face against the unrestrained license of the press; but, looking\r\nback with calmer feelings to the events of that excited period, and\r\nadmitting that the language used by the editor was certainly too strong,\r\nthough faithfully representing the feelings of a large class of the\r\npublic, it is certainly difficult to avoid now coming to the conclusion\r\nthat Mr. Alexander, when sentenced to twelve months' imprisonment in\r\nNewgate and heavy fines, was treated with a severity scarcely\r\njustifiable. It is probable that the Duke of Wellington, acting on his\r\nrigid notions of the division of responsibility, after ordering the\r\nprosecution, left the affair to Sir James Scarlet, and from that moment\r\ndeclined to interfere.\r\n\r\nAmong the discussions to which the prosecutions gave rise, an amusing\r\nspeech of Sir Charles Wetherell, on the 2nd of March, 1830, in the House\r\nof Commons, will repay perusal.\r\n\r\nIn a debate which took place in the House of Lords on the first night of\r\nthe session, upon the state of the country, the Duke of Wellington\r\ndelivered a speech upon the causes of the existing distress, which\r\nproved (allowances being made for differences of opinion) that his\r\nqualifications to deal with the most intricate questions involved in\r\ncivil government were very little inferior to his military talents.\r\nPassages from that speech will be found in the following pages. At the\r\ntime many of his views were ridiculed by those political economists who\r\nwere destined so soon to rise to power under shelter of the reform\r\nquestion; but it will be seen that the improved experience of the\r\ncountry after ten years' undisputed sway of those gentlemen, confirms\r\nmany of the chief conclusion to which the astute and practical mind of\r\nthe Duke of Wellington then led him. That speech, however, raised a\r\nhornet's nest around him in the House of Commons. Among others, Sir\r\nFrancis Burdett made a personal attack on the Duke, in which he said\r\nthat his administration showed how correct was his estimate of his own\r\npowers when he said he would be mad to think of being prime minister.\r\nThat illustrious individual, he said, had been treated with much\r\ntenderness, because he had conferred the greatest benefits on his\r\ncountry; but if his services had been great his recompense had been\r\ngreat also. Mr. Brougham, also, made a most personal attack on the Duke\r\non the day before parliament closed.\r\n\r\nIn the mean while, George the Fourth died (on the 26th of June), and\r\nparliament was dissolved. The new parliament, called by William the\r\nFourth, was opened by the king in person on November the 2nd. It was\r\ndecidedly unfavourable to the ministry, against whom were arrayed a most\r\ntalented and unscrupulous opposition. They swayed with almost absolute\r\npower the great mass of the people, who hoped everything from\r\nparliamentary reform, and had not as yet had experience of the\r\nextravagance of such hopes. A part of the tactics of the whig leaders\r\nwas to excite personal animosity against the Duke of Wellington, who was\r\nlibelled as a sort of would-be military dictator, seeking to introduce\r\nin civil affairs the iron discipline of the camp, and to ride rough shod\r\nover a free people.\r\n\r\nWith the clamour for reform out of doors and in the commons, it was not\r\nto be supposed that even the impassible Duke of Wellington could avoid\r\nreferring to the subject in the debate on the address. This he did, with\r\nmore candour than prudence, by his well-known declaration against\r\nreform, and in favour of the existing system. It will be found at length\r\nelsewhere. The excitement it produced was enormous: so great, that in\r\nthree days afterwards ministers advised William the Fourth not to\r\nproceed to the City to visit the Lord Mayor, lest there should be\r\ntumults.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th, they were defeated in the House of Commons, upon a motion\r\nof Sir Henry Parnell, for a committee to inquire into the civil list;\r\nand on the following day the Duke of Wellington and his colleagues\r\nresigned; being apprehensive that the same majority would vote for the\r\nprinciple of parliamentary reform in a day or two after, and not wishing\r\nto virtually give up that question by going out after being beaten on it\r\nin the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1831, while the discussions on the Reform Bill were\r\ngoing on, the Duke made frequent speeches against the measure, and led\r\nthe opposition in the House of Lords in a manner quite consistent with\r\nhis declaration in November. In a speech he made on the 28th March,\r\nexplanatory of the causes of his resignation, he distinctly denied that\r\nthe reform fever was owing to that declaration, and asserted that it\r\nwas to be attributed to the effect on the public mind of the revolutions\r\nin France and Belgium.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of October, after the Reform Bill had been thrown out in the\r\nHouse of Lords, the Duke of Wellington was insulted by a mob on his way\r\nto the house. In the evening, the windows of his mansion at Hyde\r\nPark-corner were broken. It is to be lamented that any class of\r\nEnglishmen were to be found so degraded as to be guilty of this\r\ningratitude.\r\n\r\nFortunately, the worst of the evil was averted, by the total\r\nindifference of the Duke to all such demonstrations. The greatest men\r\nhave been despisers of mankind, of the swaying multitude, that is to\r\nsay, the unthinking, the headstrong, and the violent--not of necessity\r\nmerely, from that intrinsic superiority and natural antagonism which\r\nforbid their commingling; but also, and with a more hearty potency, from\r\nthe experience which they, alternately the adored or the scorned, have\r\nhad of the inconstancy of the giddy people. In this light estimation,\r\nindeed, of the judgment of their less worthy fellows, lies the secret of\r\ntheir greatness and their strength. They ride towards their goal while\r\nthe stream tends that way, and when the course of the current is\r\ndiverted, they are not dismayed. Their scorn of the means leads them to\r\npass on by their own strength, or to rest secure on the foundation-rock\r\nof our moral nature--principle, and the consciousness of duty done.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1832, on the motion for the second reading of the new Reform\r\nBill in the House of Lords, the Duke made a speech, characterised by\r\nunqualified opposition to the measure, at a time when many of the\r\nconservative peers (called \"waverers,\") were for giving it a qualified\r\nsupport. But, after a defeat of ministers in committee, on Lord\r\nLyndhursts motion of the 7th of May, followed by their resignation, and\r\nwhen the king, rather than agree to create peers, called on the Duke of\r\nWellington to form an administration, he expressed his readiness to do\r\nso upon the principle of moderate reform.\r\n\r\nThis sudden inconsistency the public could not understand; the Duke's\r\navowed reason was that when called on by his sovereign he could not\r\nleave him alone in his difficulty. However, the Duke's efforts were\r\nbrought to a summary conclusion by the refusal of Sir Robert Peel to\r\njoin in the attempt.\r\n\r\nIt is amusing to see the opposite Views these two statesmen took of\r\ntheir duties to their king. Sir Robert Peel considered that \"his\r\nacceptance of office pledged to carry an efficient Reform Bill, he being\r\na determined enemy to such a measure, would be a political immorality\r\nwhich would not allow him to enter on his services with a firm step, a\r\nlight heart, and an erect attitude.\" The Duke said, \"if he had refused\r\nto assist his majesty, because he had hitherto given his opposition to\r\nparliamentary reform, he would not have been able to show his face in\r\nthe streets for shame of having deserted his sovereign in circumstances\r\nso painful and alarming.\" The result of Sir Robert's refusal was, that\r\nthe Duke gave up the attempt, and Earl Grey was recalled.\r\n\r\nDuring the sessions of 1833 and 1834, the Duke was the leader of the\r\nopposition in the House of Lords; always at his post, and always ready\r\nto grapple with the different questions brought before the peers. On the\r\n9th of June, 1834, took place his installation as Chancellor of the\r\nUniversity of Oxford;--a brilliant scene, at which some of the most\r\ndistinguished men of the day assisted.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1834, on the death of Lord Spencer, and the dismissal of\r\nthe whig ministry, the king called on the Duke of Wellington to form an\r\nadministration. The Duke recommended his majesty to entrust that office\r\nto Sir Robert Peel, who, however, was then at Rome. During the interval\r\nthat elapsed before his arrival, the Duke accepted, provisionally, the\r\noffice of First Lord of the Treasury, and the seals of the three\r\nsecretaryships of state. On Sir Robert Peel's arrival, he gave up the\r\ngovernment, with the exception of the office of Secretary for Foreign\r\nAffairs, which (December 9th) he retained.\r\n\r\nMuch clamour was at this time raised against the Duke by the whigs, on\r\nthe old score of dictatorship, and also as to a supposed insult offered\r\nto Lord Melbourne.\r\n\r\nOn the meeting of parliament in the following February (on the 24th),\r\nthe Duke gave an explanation of his conduct (inserted in this volume),\r\nsufficient to clear him in all impartial eyes of all the charges then\r\nurged against him by party spirit.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of April following, in consequence of the repeated defeats\r\nsustained in the House of Commons by Sir Robert Peel, the conservative\r\nministry resigned, and with them of course the Duke of Wellington. From\r\nthat time until the re-accession of Sir Robert Peel to power, in 1841,\r\nthe Duke continued to lead, with his accustomed vigour and unpretending\r\nability, the opposition in the House of Lords. In this position, he\r\nexercised the utmost forbearance towards the government; never using his\r\npower except when circumstances absolutely required its exercise.\r\n\r\nOne of these instances occurred at the opening of the session of 1836,\r\nwhen the principles of a particular measure were recommended in a speech\r\nfrom the throne. To the address the Duke moved an amendment,\r\ncondemnatory of the practice of thus pledging the sovereign in a speech\r\nfrom the throne to the principles of any measure. The amendment was\r\nagreed to by the whigs.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole interval between 1833 and 1841, the Duke is to be found\r\noccasionally speaking in the upper house, in his capacity of leader of\r\nopposition. The same sound practical sense which has been already\r\nattributed to him, characterised his whole proceedings. It is needless\r\nto particularise the different important debates in which he took part.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1839, a grand banquet was given to the Duke at Dover, as Lord\r\nWarden of the Cinque Ports. A splendid pavilion was erected for the\r\noccasion, in which two thousand persons, including some most\r\ndistinguished men, sat down to dinner. The gallery was filled with\r\nladies. The most interesting point in the day's proceedings, was when\r\nLord Brougham, the most active and distinguished civilian of his age,\r\nrose to propose the health of the Duke of Wellington, the most\r\nillustrious military commander. Eulogium could scarcely he carried\r\nfarther than it was by Lord Brougham in these words:--\r\n\r\n\"Although no man,\" said the noble and learned lord, \"on such an\r\noccasion, is entitled to entertain any personal feelings on his own\r\nbehalf, it would be affectation--it would be insolent ingratitude--were\r\nI not to express the sentiments which glow within my bosom, at being\r\nmade the instrument of making known those feelings which reign\r\npredominant in yours. Enough, however, of myself--now for my mighty\r\nsubject.--But the choice you have made of your instrument--of your\r\norgan, as it were, on this occasion--is not unconnected with that\r\nsubject; for it shows that on this day, on this occasion, all personal,\r\nall political feelings are quelled--all strife of party is hushed--that\r\nwe are incapable, whatever be our opinions, of refusing to acknowledge\r\ntranscendant merit, and of denying that we feel the irresistible impulse\r\nof unbounded gratitude; and I am therefore asked to do this service, as\r\nif to show that no difference of opinion upon subjects, however\r\nimportant--no long course of opposition, however contracted upon public\r\nprinciples--not even long inveterate habits of public opposition--are\r\nable so far to stifle the natural feelings of our hearts, so far to\r\nobscure our reason, as to prevent us from feeling as we ought--boundless\r\ngratitude for boundless merit. Neither can it pluck from our minds that\r\nadmiration proportioned to the transcendant genius, in peace and in war,\r\nof him who is amongst us to-day; nor can it lighten or alleviate the\r\npainful, the deep sense which the untried mind never can get rid of when\r\nit is overwhelmed by a debt of gratitude, too boundless to be repaid.\r\nParty--the spirit of party--may do much, but it cannot operate so far as\r\nto make us forget those services; it cannot so far bewilder the memory,\r\nand pervert the judgment, and eradicate from our bosoms those feelings\r\nwhich do us the most honour, and are the most unavoidable, and, as it\r\nwere, dry up the kindly juices of the heart; and, notwithstanding all\r\nits vile and malignant influence on other occasions, it cannot dry up\r\nthose juices of the heart so as to parch it like very charcoal, and make\r\nit almost as black. But what else have I to do? If I had all the\r\neloquence of all the tongues ever attuned to speak, what else could I\r\ndo? How could a thousand words, or all the names that could be named,\r\nspeak so powerfully--ay, even if I spoke with the tongue of an angel, as\r\nif I were to mention one word--Sir Arthur Wellesley, Duke of Wellington,\r\nthe hero of a hundred fields, in all of which his banner was waved in\r\ntriumph; who never, I invoke both hemispheres to witness--bear witness\r\nEurope, bear witness Asia--who never advanced but to cover his arms with\r\nglory; the captain who never advanced but to be victorious; the mightier\r\ncaptain who never retreated but to eclipse the glory of his advance, by\r\nthe yet harder task of unwearied patience, indomitable to lassitude, the\r\ninexhaustible resources of transcendant skill, showing the wonders, the\r\nmarvels of a moral courage never yet subdued. Despising all who thwarted\r\nhim with ill-considered advice--neglecting all hostility, so he knew it\r\nto be groundless--laughing to scorn reviling enemies, jealous\r\ncompetitors, lukewarm friends, ay, hardest of all, to neglect despising\r\neven a fickle public, he cast his eye forwards as a man might--else he\r\ndeserves not to command men--cast forward his eye to a time when that\r\nmomentary fickleness of the people would pass away, knowing that in the\r\nend the people are always just to merit.\"\r\n\r\nThe Duke's acknowledgement, was simple, according to his character, and\r\nmodest as became his position. He said, \"The noble lord, who I hope will\r\nallow me to call him my noble friend, has stated to you with great\r\ntruth, that there are times and circumstances in which, and under which,\r\nall feelings of party, all party animosity, all descriptions of\r\npolitical feelings must be laid aside. I must do my noble and learned\r\nfriend the justice to say, that for years and years there has been\r\nnothing of that description in social life as between him and me,\r\nnotwithstanding which it is certainly true that I have had the\r\nmisfortune of differing in opinion with my noble and learned friend upon\r\nmany points of internal and possibly of other descriptions of policy.\r\nBut I am afraid that, notwithstanding my most anxious wish to co-operate\r\nwith all of you in the public service in which we have all been\r\nemployed, I may happen (I know it does happen) to differ with some of\r\nyou upon subjects of political interest to the country. But my noble and\r\nlearned friend judges of you correctly when he says that such feelings\r\nof difference would not prevent you--as they have not prevented\r\nyou--from doing me the honour of inviting me to this festival, and of\r\nbringing here to meet me not only the whole of this interesting county,\r\nbut persons from all parts of the kingdom and even from abroad.\r\nTherefore my noble and learned friend does you as well as himself\r\njustice when he states that there are occasions--occasions in relation\r\nto individuals as well as in relation to public interests and\r\nservices--in which all feelings of party politics and opinions must be\r\nlaid aside, in order to carry on the public service to the greatest\r\npoint of advantage to the public interest. I have had sufficient\r\nexperience in public life to know that this must be the case. I am\r\nconvinced that it is that feeling which has induced you to pay this\r\ntribute of respect to the person holding the situation of Lord Warden of\r\nthe Cinque Ports, in order that you might encourage others hereafter to\r\nperform their duty honestly and conscientiously in the same honourable\r\noffice.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 18th November, the same year, the Duke had an attack of epilepsy,\r\nwhich for a short time alarmed the public greatly for his safety, on\r\naccount of his advanced age. Sir Astley Cooper and Dr. Hume were down at\r\nWalmer with him for a week, at the end of which time he recovered,\r\ngreatly to the joy of the whole nation. It turned out that the Duke had\r\nbrought on the attack adopting, to cure himself of a slight illness, a\r\nmode of treatment which would not be the most wise in a man of\r\ntwenty-five, but was most dangerous to one so advanced in years. The\r\nDuke is very determined on such points--can never be persuaded that he\r\nis not the same man in point of constitution that he was when in the\r\nPeninsula; and still preserves all the hardy habits of a soldier's life.\r\nOn this occasion he had sought to cure himself by fasting and cold\r\nbathing: he then, while under this treatment, followed the hounds, the\r\nconsequence of which was that he fainted, and was soon afterwards seized\r\nas described.\r\n\r\nOn the return of Sir Robert Peel to power, in 1841, the Duke of\r\nWellington again joined him; but this time he took no office, though\r\naccepting a seat in the cabinet. He still continued to lead in the\r\nlords, where his influence is fully felt, and where he constantly\r\nastonishes the house and silences his detractors by displaying a degree\r\nof knowledge on all legislative subjects scarcely compatible with his\r\nmilitary education, and an activity and attention to business that would\r\nbe admirable in any one, but which are still more praiseworthy as the\r\nvoluntary service of a man who has conferred such distinguished benefits\r\non his country.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFew men have been so blessed by fortune as to have been enabled to\r\nachieve a first-rate reputation in arms, and afterwards to arrive at as\r\ngreat distinction in the arts of peace. Rarely, at long intervals in the\r\nlapse of time, such opportunities have been afforded to great men; but\r\nstill more rarely have even the greatest men been able to use them. To\r\nthe Duke of Wellington, in our own time, has this high honour been\r\nespecially vouchsafed; and no man ever yet lived who shewed himself more\r\nworthy the distinction, or more able to fulfill the demands of his\r\ncountry, whether in peace or in war. His youth and prime were spent in\r\nachieving victories: to preserve to posterity the fruits of those\r\nvictories, in steady government, together with free institutions; to\r\nmake England such an example for foreign nations as would render all\r\nsuch victories unnecessary hereafter; this has been the still more\r\nglorious task of his declining years.\r\n\r\nThe military reputation of the Duke of Wellington rests on so firm a\r\nbasis, that it will never be shaken. So long as military science is\r\nnecessary in the world, so long will his system of tactics be followed\r\nby commanders responsible in their own hearts for the lives of their\r\nsoldiers, and to their country for the conduct of their enterprises.\r\n\r\nOf the military value of his dispositions and movements, military\r\ncritics have recorded, almost universally, their unqualified praise. To\r\ncivilians, it is left to admire the constant and watchful care of the\r\nDuke, whether in India or the Peninsula, in securing the due provision\r\nfor his troops, while he at the same time maintained the strictest\r\nhonour towards the natives who supplied them; and to respect the\r\nclearness of his perception, the sagacity of his decisions, and, above\r\nall, the firmness and determination of purpose which sustained him\r\namidst every drawback and difficulty, until by his success he compelled\r\nhis detractors to yield themselves captive to his judgment. It is only\r\nnecessary to read the dispatches and general orders of the Duke of\r\nWellington, in order to be convinced that he is not a mere soldier\r\nwinning battles by superior tactics, but that he is also a man of a\r\nvery high order of general talent, with an unusual insight into human\r\nnature, and possessing almost an instinctive knowledge of how mankind\r\nare to be governed. By that wonderful exposition of the comprehensive,\r\nwise, and philanthropic mind of the man, even his enemies were subdued.\r\n\r\nMuch controversy has been spent upon the demeanour of the Duke towards\r\nhis soldiers, which has been stigmatised as cold, distant, at times\r\nharsh, and even selfish. For the charges of coldness and distance there\r\nappears to be some foundation. Unlike Napoleon, the Duke of Wellington\r\nnever appealed to the enthusiasm of his soldiers; but he always relied\r\nupon their sense of duty. He regarded his army, organized by discipline,\r\nas a perfect machine, upon the performance of which he could calculate\r\nwith precision, and as he never expected it to do more than it ought, so\r\nhe never looked to see it do less. The idea of duty, of absolute\r\nresponsibility and subordination from rank to rank, seems to have been\r\nthat to which he was always content to appeal. Accordingly, his troops\r\nnever failed him. Their rock-like steadfastness and constant unimpulsive\r\nbravery, it was that enabled him to carry out his plans with such\r\ncertainty.\r\n\r\nThe contrast to Napoleon is no Where more seen than in the dispatches of\r\nthe one and the bulletins of the other. In his demeanour to his men, the\r\nDuke was reserved; in his language, curt and laconic. If his troops felt\r\nthe moral certainty that he was leading them to victory, and honoured\r\nhim accordingly, it was not from personal enthusiasm, such as the wild\r\nlove the emperor inspired in those around him, but from a deep respect\r\nfor his character and a reliance on his talents. Nor did he condescend\r\nto charlatantism or bombast, as his great rival too often did. There is\r\nnot the slightest trace of vanity about him. Compare the speech of the\r\none to his army, beneath the Pyramids, with the simple, \"Up, guards, and\r\nat them!\" of the other. In these trifles, we find the key to the real\r\nminds of great men.\r\n\r\nThe political character of the Duke, and his services as a civilian,\r\nhave never been sufficiently appreciated by the great mass of his\r\ncountrymen. His brilliant military reputation cast into the shade his\r\nsterling but unobtrusive services as a senator and as a minister. It was\r\neven the fashion, for a long time, to assert that his taking office at\r\nall was a sign of defective judgment. Indeed, when he declared, in the\r\nHouse of Lords, that he would be \"worse than mad to think of such a\r\nthing,\" he gave a colour to the supposition. His subsequent assertion,\r\nafter he had become prime minister, that he had done so \"because nobody\r\nelse would,\" conveyed, in all probability, the simple truth. The Duke\r\ndid not know his own capacity for government, until it was tried.\r\n\r\nAnother reason why his positive worth, as a politician, has not been so\r\nuniversally admitted as his military merit, is that, in the imaginations\r\nof a large portion of the public, he has been identified with a party.\r\nThis, in a country where party spirit is so strong and so universal,\r\nwould alone be sufficient to secure his being misunderstood by all those\r\nwho are not of the party to which he is alleged to be devoted. But it\r\nis a mistake to call the Duke of Wellington a party man; that is to say,\r\nin the ordinary sense of the word. It is true that, during the greater\r\npart of his life he has acted with what is called the conservative\r\nparty, because in England no man can expect to serve his country\r\nefficiently, unless he enlists under some political banner or other. But\r\nthere is a great difference between acting generally with a party, and\r\nthe adoption of all its animosities and prejudices: and this difference\r\nthe Duke of Wellington appears always to have perceived and acted upon.\r\nWherever the choice has lain between the opinions of his party and the\r\ngeneral good of his country, the Duke has always preferred his country\r\nto his party; and if that is the character of a party man, may all\r\npoliticians be speedily imbued with the same sentiments!\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this distinction, however, it is certain that the known\r\nopinions of the Duke of Wellington, and his ultimately taking office as\r\nthe prime minister of the tory party, did lead to the belief that he was\r\na party man, and directed towards him all those animosities and all that\r\ndepreciating rancour which party spirit engenders, and which party\r\ntactics perpetuate; so that during a period of some four or five years\r\nhis distinguished reputation as a soldier was obscured in the minds of\r\nmany millions of his country, who,--and this remark applies more\r\nparticularly to the years 1829, 1830, and 1831,--laid themselves open to\r\nthe charge of being guilty of that meanest and basest of all crimes,\r\ningratitude.\r\n\r\nHappily, within the last ten years, a total change has come over the\r\npublic mind. Those ill-grounded animosities are forgotten: the long and\r\nunparalleled services of the Duke are remembered: and a re-action,\r\nproduced by a sense of shame acting upon early affections, has made him\r\nmore popular, more beloved, more admired than ever he was before.\r\n\r\nLook at the course of business in the House of Lords during the last few\r\nyears, and you will observe that the Duke of Wellington has been the\r\npresiding spirit of that assembly. Nothing was done--nothing could be\r\ndone without him; for he carries with him the proxies of so many of the\r\nthinking, experienced, far-seeing, influential of his countrymen.\r\n\r\nIt has been argued, that the Duke of Wellington possesses all this\r\ninfluence by virtue of his leadership of a powerful party. Of course\r\nthis means that any other leader of the conservatives could possess as\r\nmuch, or it means nothing. It is a fallacy. The Duke of Wellington's\r\nclaims are almost entirely personal. It is to himself alone that all\r\nthis silent homage is paid. Even were he to retire from active life\r\nto-morrow, still would he be followed into his retirement by political\r\npupils, eager to imbibe those distillations of practical wisdom which\r\nhis sagacity extracts from his vast stores of experience.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental basis of this power is his high military reputation;\r\nthough that alone could not have secured it, unless accompanied by his\r\nfirm principles and habits of observation. England differs from France\r\nin this respect,--that while our neighbours are more ready to elevate\r\ntalent above property than we are, they are less choice as to the degree\r\nof the talent which they exalt. But if the English once know that they\r\npossess a first-rate man, they place him from that hour securely on an\r\neminence, whence he may look down as from the heavens, upon wealth,\r\nrank, blood, and every earthly distinction. The Duke of Wellington is a\r\nfirst-rate man; and his countrymen acknowledge it with pride. But his\r\nmind is _sui generis_. His qualities are eminently useful: he could\r\nnever have condescended to be brilliant. His mind is that of iron mould\r\nthat defies alike warping, meretricious polish, or demolition.\r\n\r\nIt is a conviction of the thorough and unflinching honesty of his views\r\nand principles, and of the clear perception, the fruitful experience,\r\nand sound practical sense which regulate his opinions, that makes the\r\nDuke of Wellington the governing spirit in the House of Peers. There is\r\nno man in that house, be his talents or his services what they may,\r\nwhose opinion carries so much weight with it; for there is no other man\r\nso independent of party. All the others, however moderate their natures\r\nor honest their intentions, have been compelled to give in at some time\r\nor other to the spirit of party. But the Duke is above party. He entered\r\nthe House of Peers with an overpowering reputation, which enabled him\r\nfrom the first to take high ground. He does not need to curry favour\r\nwith any man; nor does he fear to offend even the most powerful of his\r\nsupporters, when his cause is just.\r\n\r\nBut the Duke's ascendancy in the House of Peers is not to be referred\r\nto the foregoing causes alone. Had he none of that personal influence\r\nderived from services and character to which we have referred, his\r\nabilities and information alone would enable him to take high rank. His\r\nclaims in these respects are much, underrated by those who are opposed\r\nto him in politics. His reasoning is so simple, clear and palpable--so\r\nmuch in the character of what is called common sense--and his style of\r\nspeaking so unpretending and free from ornament, that superficial\r\nobservers have set him down as a mere blunt soldier, with a few fixed\r\nideas, and a disposition dogmatically to insist on their adoption. This\r\nis altogether a mistake. The Duke of Wellington has as much of the true\r\nspirit of the statesman as any man who now affects the destinies of this\r\ncountry. There is scarcely a subject that has come before parliament\r\nsince the commencement of his political career into which he has not\r\nfully entered. The character of his mind is to grasp every question.\r\nLess than mastery of it--so far as the formation of a decided opinion\r\naccording to the lights afforded to or by his mind--will not satisfy\r\nhim. With the exception of one or two questions of high constitutional\r\nprinciple, the \"_cui bono?_\" is the view his mind naturally takes. He is\r\na practical utilitarian, seeking in every measure the utmost quantity of\r\ngood of which it is capable; not always as much as he would perhaps wish\r\nto see, but as much as circumstances allow the hope of securing.\r\n\r\nThis mode of dealing with subjects is not well calculated for\r\noratorical display, or for the parade of extensive information, even if\r\nthe unaffected character of the Duke of Wellington would allow him to\r\navail himself of them. They are cast aside, in pursuit of a less\r\nbrilliant, but more useful, mode of treatment. Accordingly, the speeches\r\nof the Duke are brief, clear, pointed, and in one sense dogmatical.\r\nAfter having canvassed details, and brought to bear upon them his long\r\nand varied experience, he states his conclusions, accompanying them with\r\nthe general principles that have guided their formation, in a few brief\r\nauthoritative sentences. He is very careless about catching stray\r\nlisteners, or drawing in his train the prejudiced or the inexperienced;\r\nbut rather addresses himself to those whose age and wisdom entitle them\r\nto anticipate consequences, or to those to whom experience of the value\r\nof his opinions may have taught a pre-disposed deference.\r\n\r\nAt other times, however--for instance, when making ministerial\r\nstatements on matters connected with finance, or foreign policy, or\r\nimportant changes in the law--this short, abrupt, devil-may-care style\r\nis changed for one eminently adapted to the object. No one can then\r\ncomplain of a want of the proper information. All the historical facts,\r\nor figures, or principles, or general details, are then marshalled\r\nforward with a regularity and precision only to be equalled by the\r\nmilitary arrangements of the Duke. There is not a word too much or too\r\nlittle: you are made thoroughly to comprehend the whole bearings of the\r\nquestion, without being overburthened with the useless details that so\r\noften figure in the speeches of orators of the red-tape school. The\r\nnatural superiority of the Duke's mind is never more exhibited than in\r\nthe masterly way in which he separates the wheat from the chaff, and\r\nweaves a clear and connected statement from masses of facts, on subjects\r\nso foreign to the military pursuits of his youth and manhood.\r\n\r\nTo many, this praise of the Duke of Wellington, in a character in which\r\nhe is so little known to the great mass of the public, will appear\r\nexaggerated; but those who have been accustomed to observe him in the\r\nHouse of Peers, will not be surprised to hear the estimation in which he\r\nis held by his political contemporaries of all parties. Those who have\r\nnot heard and seen him in his character of politician and statesman,\r\nwill scarcely continue sceptical (even if they are so), after having\r\nread the extracts contained in the following pages.\r\n\r\nMuch, however, as the independent spirit of self-reliance of the Duke,\r\nfortified by his character and experience, has secured him sway in the\r\nHouse of Lords, we must not blind ourselves to the fact, that this\r\nillustrious man has sometimes, in the assertion of his opinions\r\n(unconsciously, we believe, and unintentionally) fallen into a practice\r\nof dogmatising, of calling on the House of Peers and the public to adopt\r\nhis views, not so much on account of reasons urged in their support, as\r\nbecause they are stated by him. Rarely, however, have such instances\r\noccurred, and in extenuation of what, in a country of free discussion,\r\nwould justly be deemed a dangerous innovation, we must bear in mind\r\nthat where a man's opinions are the result of vary long experience and\r\nvery extensive observation, it is not always possible to make the\r\ngeneral mind aware of the process by which particular principles or\r\nviews have been arrived at. The greatest men have often been compelled\r\nto content themselves with the simple assertion of opinions not pleasing\r\nto the multitude, and to appeal to time as the only test of their truth.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Wellington looks to the practical common-sense bearing of\r\nevery subject brought under his notice. His first aim is the public\r\ngood; his next, how to attain that good with the least departure from\r\nestablished principles of policy. This practical turn of mind, joined as\r\nit is to a far-seeing and prophetic spirit, has contributed to confirm\r\nin the minds of his countrymen the admiration and influence which his\r\nmilitary genius and success first created. They repose the utmost\r\nconfidence in his sagacity; he is a party in himself. Whatever is\r\nessential to the national reputation, the welfare of the whole people,\r\nand, above all, to the stability of property, is sure to be originated,\r\nor, at all events, warmly supported by him.\r\n\r\nFor this reason a revolution never could have occurred under the\r\ngovernment of the Duke; he has too intense a horror of the evils of\r\ncivil contention, ever to have allowed matters to come to that pass.\r\nThis, it will be admitted, is a quality rarely to be found in a soldier,\r\nand a soldier, too, of such an inflexible cast as the Duke. Not less\r\nintense is his regard for national faith and honour. He would maintain\r\nthe honour of the state at any expense, even of his own personal\r\nprejudices on home politics; for the Duke, like all strong-minded men,\r\nhas his prejudices. He has vanquished, and obtained the mastery of the\r\nspirit of change, by showing that he can curb it, while he does not\r\naffect to play the tyrant over it. He knows when to be firm and when to\r\nyield. Many acts of the Duke of Wellington, in the course of his\r\npolitical career, that have called forth unlimited censure, have been\r\nbased upon calculations which only so well-tutored and so well-stored a\r\nmind could have made.\r\n\r\nIt is an intellectual treat of the highest order to see the Duke of\r\nWellington's demeanour in the House of Lords. It is essentially\r\ndifferent from that of every other man there. He is almost the only\r\nunfettered man in the house. Others are fettered by obstacles which they\r\ncreate for themselves, in various ways, by the too eager pursuit of\r\npersonal or party objects. But the Duke of Wellington's high reputation\r\nand standing place him above all such considerations. He can afford to\r\nspeak the truth, and he does speak it on all occasions fearlessly. While\r\nother speakers, on either side of the house, have been wasting their\r\npowers in fruitless eloquence (mere personal display), or in perverting\r\nthe truth for the purpose, either of unfair attack or unfair defence,\r\nthe Duke of Wellington has appeared to be paying not the slightest\r\nattention to the proceedings. He has sat absorbed in thought, or at\r\nleast in seeming indifference. You would almost suppose that, overcome\r\nby fatigue, or indisposition, he was sleeping, so perfectly motionless\r\nand silent is he, reclining, with folded arms, his legs stretched out\r\nto their full length, and his hat over his brow. The question has been\r\ndiscussed, argued, disputed upon for hours. No result seems to have been\r\ncome to, and you are as ignorant of the object and scope of the measure\r\nas when the debate began; nor have you any clear idea what will become\r\nof the bill.\r\n\r\nAt length, the Duke of Wellington rises, advances abruptly to the table,\r\nwraps the tails of his coat, like a dressing-gown, over his legs, and\r\nplunges at once _in medias res_. There is an undivided attention while\r\nhe speaks, indeed, it is sometimes absolutely necessary, for, when\r\nindisposed, he is often with difficulty heard, even by those near to\r\nhim, as, indeed, he himself hears with difficulty, from being deaf on\r\none side. But in a moment you see that his mind is still as vigorous as\r\never. His keen intelligence pierces at once to the very core of the\r\nsubject; no fallacy can blind or deceive the Duke of Wellington. He\r\nknows why the measure was introduced, what it is, what it will do, and\r\nwhat will become of it. He grapples with it in the spirit of a\r\nstatesman. He is a guardian of the interests of the nation; he is the\r\nparliamentary trustee of the people; he is bound to look to their\r\ninterests as a whole, for by the people he understands, not those who\r\nbawl the loudest about their rights, but those also who trust the\r\nmaintenance of their privileges and their interests to parliament, in\r\nsilent faith. He never forgets the _salus populi_.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the chap-trap maxims of liberalism, foreign or\r\ndomestic, meet from him with just as much credence and attention as\r\nthey deserve; he never allows enthusiasm to intrude among political\r\nconsiderations. He measures the length, breadth, and thickness of the\r\nbill before him; calculates with his unerring precision and practical\r\nwisdom, the effect which it will have, either on the happiness of the\r\npeople, or on the social or political constitution of the country.\r\nAccording to its value for good or for evil, does the Duke of Wellington\r\nsupport or oppose it; and from that hour its fate is usually decided.\r\nWhy? because the unbending unflinching honesty of the man, and his\r\npolitical sagacity, have created him a character unprecedented in the\r\nannals of his country.\r\n\r\nThe Duke's style of speaking is what might be expected from his\r\ncharacter, plain, simple, straightforward. His sentences are short and\r\npithy, his language clear and lucid; his delivery abrupt. When he makes\r\na point, it falls on the mind with the force of a sledge-hammer. His\r\nvoice reminds one of that of an officer giving the word of command; he\r\nlays emphasis, short and somewhat harsh, on the leading words of the\r\nsentence, and speaks the rest in an under tone. Although, however, in\r\nconsequence of his age and the gradual approach of infirmity, his\r\nutterance is not so clear as it used to be, yet you can always\r\nunderstand immediately his whole meaning. He uses the plainest language\r\nof every-day colloquy. His style is impressive from its doric\r\nsimplicity. You never entertain a doubt of his sincerity; and although\r\nyou may not always agree with him in opinion, you have, at least, the\r\nsatisfaction of knowing that his propositions are the true result of\r\nhis feelings or his thoughts; and are not merely put forward to answer\r\nthe purposes of party, or to secure a triumph in debate.\r\n\r\nFor the same reason, the Duke never attempts to impose on the house a\r\nfictitious enthusiasm, or a pretended excitement. If he gets excited,\r\n(and he will sometimes get into a terrible passion at any infringement\r\nof constitutional integrity or breach of discipline), there is no\r\nmistaking it for a mere prepared climax to a speech; he is completely\r\npossessed by the demon. The only action he ever uses is on such\r\noccasions, and then it is almost convulsive. His arms and legs seem no\r\nlonger to be under control, they quiver, and shake, and tremble: and the\r\nclenched fist, violently and frequently struck upon the table, denotes\r\nthat some very potent feeling of indignation is, for the time, mastering\r\nthe usual calmness of this self-possessed man.\r\n\r\nYet though at times he is thus carried away by his feelings, his\r\nultimate judgment of a measure is not impaired by it. He can cauterise\r\nor cut out the cankered part, and yet preserve all that was not\r\noffensive to his sense of right and wrong.\r\n\r\nThose who have read the speeches of the Duke, will have remarked the\r\nintensely British feeling that pervades them. He is like the old Romans\r\nin his admiration and love for his country and her institutions. The\r\nsame feeling breathes in all his speeches. The same magnanimous brevity\r\nthat marked the public declarations of that haughty people, dignifies\r\nthe addresses of the Duke of Wellington. Some of his sayings, as, for\r\ninstance, \"that a great nation can never wage a little war,\" will he\r\nembalmed in history. His denunciations are like the alarum of a war\r\ntrumpet. The same character of simplicity which marks the Duke's\r\nspeeches pervades his whole conduct, public and private. Though no man\r\nis more capable of enjoying the refinements of modern society, luxury\r\nhas not enervated his mind or his manners. His dress, his equipage, his\r\nhabits, all partake of the same indifference to effect--all have a cast\r\nof the hardy self-denial of the camp. A mattress bed, constant horse\r\nexercise, rising with the lark, not unfrequently remaining up twenty\r\nhours out of the twenty-four, and the daily use of cold shower baths,\r\nwinter and summer,--these contradictions to the usual habits of men,\r\nwhen their age approaches to fourscore, bespeak no ordinary carelessness\r\nof ease, and a singular determination of purpose. Well, indeed, has he\r\nbeen named the Iron Duke.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIMS AND OPINIONS OF HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nINDIA.\r\n\r\nTo offer a public reward, by proclamation, for a man's life, and to make\r\na secret bargain to have it taken away, are very different things; the\r\none is to be done, the other, in my opinion, cannot by an officer at the\r\nhead of the troops.\r\n\r\n_Dispatch, July 8, 1800._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs for the wishes of the people, particularly in this country (India), I\r\nput them out of the question. They are the only philosophers about their\r\ngovernors that ever I met with, if indifference constitutes that\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\n_Dispatch, August 20, 1800._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn military operations time is everything.\r\n\r\n_Dispatch, June 30, 1800._\r\n\r\nArticles of provision are not to be trifled with, or left to chance;\r\nand there is nothing more clear than that the subsistence of the troops\r\nmust be certain upon the proposed service, or the service must be\r\nrelinquished.\r\n\r\n_Dispatch, Feb. 18, 1801._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Indignant rejection of a proffered Bribe._\r\n\r\nYou inform me that the Rajah, or Dessaye of Kittoor, has expressed a\r\nwish to be taken under the protection of the British Government; and has\r\noffered to pay a tribute to the company, and to give you a bribe of 4000\r\npagodas, and me one of 10,000 pagodas, provided this point is arranged\r\naccording to his wishes.\r\n\r\nI cannot conceive what can have induced the Rajah of Kittoor to imagine\r\nthat I was capable of receiving that or any other sum of money, as an\r\ninducement to do that which he must think improper, or he would not have\r\noffered it. But I shall advert to that point more particularly\r\npresently.\r\n\r\nThe Rajah of Kittoor is a tributary of the Mahratta Government, the head\r\nof which is an ally, by treaty, of the honourable company. It would be,\r\ntherefore, to the full as proper, that any officer in command of a post\r\nwithin the company's territories, should listen to and enter into a plan\r\nfor seizing part of the Mahratta territories, as it is for you to listen\r\nand encourage an offer from the Rajah of Kittoor to accept the\r\nprotection of, and transfer his allegiance and tribute to the honourable\r\ncompany's government. In case you should hear anything further upon\r\nthis subject from the Rajah of Kittoor, or in future from any of the\r\nchiefs of the Mahrattas on the frontier, I desire that you will tell\r\nthem what is the fact, that you have no authority whatever to listen to\r\nsuch proposals, that you have orders only to keep up with them the usual\r\nintercourse of civility and friendship, and that if they have any\r\nproposals of that kind to make, they must be made in a proper manner to\r\nour superiors. You may, at the same time, inform them that you have my\r\nauthority to say that the British government is very little likely to\r\ntake advantage of the misfortunes of its ally, to deprive him, either of\r\nhis territories or of the allegiance or tribute due to him by his\r\ntributaries.\r\n\r\nIn respect to the bribe offered to you and myself, I am surprised that\r\nany man in the character of a British officer should not have given the\r\nRajah to understand that the offer would be considered as an insult; and\r\nthat he should not have forbidden its renewal, than that he should have\r\nencouraged it, and even offered to receive a quarter of the sum proposed\r\nto be given him for prompt payment. I can attribute your conduct on this\r\noccasion, to nothing excepting the most inconsiderate indiscretion, and\r\nto a desire to benefit yourself, which got the better of your prudence.\r\nI desire, however, that you will refrain from the subject with the Rajah\r\nof Kittoor at all, and that if he should renew it, you will inform him,\r\nthat I and all British officers consider such offers as insults on the\r\npart of them by whom made.\r\n\r\n_Letter to an officer in India, January 20, 1803._\r\n\r\n_Principle of Warfare in India._\r\n\r\nWe must get the upper hand, and if once we have that, we shall keep it\r\nwith ease, and shall certainly succeed. But if we begin by a long\r\ndefensive warfare, and go looking after convoys that are scattered over\r\nthe face of the earth, and do not attack briskly, we shall soon be in\r\ndistress.\r\n\r\n_Dispatch, Aug. 17, 1803._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_How to avoid Party Spirit in the Army._\r\n\r\nIt occurs to me that there is much party in the army in your quarter;\r\nthis must be put an end to. And there is only one mode of effecting\r\nthis, and that is for the commanding officer to be of no side excepting\r\nthat of the public; to employ indiscriminately those who can best serve\r\nthe public, be they who they may, or in whatever service; the\r\nconsequence will be that the service will go on, all parties will join\r\nin forwarding it, and in respecting him; there will be an end to their\r\npetty disputes about trifles; and the commanding officer will be at the\r\nhead of an army instead of a party.\r\n\r\n_Letter to an officer, Sept. 16, 1803._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The power of the Sword necessary in India._\r\n\r\nIt is necessary that the political agents at the durbars of the native\r\nprinces should be supposed to have a considerable degree of power. In\r\nthis part of the world there is no power excepting that of the sword;\r\nand it follows that if these political agents have no authority over the\r\nmilitary, they have no power whatever.\r\n\r\nThe natives would soon find out this state of weakness, and the\r\nresidents would lose their influence over their councils. It may be\r\nargued if that is the case, the military commanding officer ought to be\r\nthe resident, or political agent. In answer to this argument, I say,\r\nthat the same reasoning applies to every part of the executive\r\ngovernment; and that, upon this ground, the whole ought to be in the\r\nhands of the military. In short, the only conclusion to be drawn from\r\nall reflection and reasoning upon the subject is, that the British\r\ngovernment in India is a phenomenon; and that it will not answer to\r\napply to it, in its present state, either the rules which guide other\r\ngovernments, or the reasoning upon which these rules are founded.\r\n\r\n_Dispatch, Oct. 13, 1803._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Reason for the ambiguity of Treaties._\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to frame a treaty of peace in such a manner as to find\r\nin it a decision of all questions which can arise between the parties\r\nconcerned; particularly when the parties have frequently been at war,\r\nand have preserved a recollection of a variety of contradictory claims\r\narising out of the events of their wars, which they are ready to bring\r\nforward on all occasions.\r\n\r\n_Dispatch, Jan. 7, 1804._\r\n\r\n_Foundation of British Power in India in 1803._\r\n\r\nThe British government has been left by the late Mahratta war in a most\r\nglorious situation. They are the sovereigns of a great part of India,\r\nthe protectors of the principal powers, and the mediators by treaty of\r\nthe disputes of all. The sovereignty they possess is greater, and their\r\npower is settled upon more permanent foundations, than any before known\r\nin India; all it wants is the popularity which, from the nature of the\r\ninstitutions and the justice of the proceedings of the government, it is\r\nlikely to obtain, and which it must obtain, after a short period of\r\ntranquillity shall have given the people time and opportunity to feel\r\nthe happiness and security which they enjoy.\r\n\r\n_Dispatch, Jan. 16, 1804._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_British \"Moderation\" in India._\r\n\r\nI declare that, when I view the treaty of peace,[2] and its\r\nconsequences, I am afraid it will be imagined that the moderation of the\r\nBritish government in India has a strong resemblance to the ambition of\r\nother governments.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: After the Mahratta war.]\r\n\r\n_Jan. 29, 1804._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Contrast between European and Asiatic Policy._\r\n\r\nEuropean governments were, till very lately, guided by certain rules and\r\nsystems of policy so accurately defined and generally known, that it was\r\nscarcely possible to suppose a political event, in which the interest\r\nand conduct of each state would not be as well known to the corps\r\ndiplomatique, in general, as to the statesmen of each particular state.\r\nThe Asiatic governments do not acknowledge, and hardly know of, such\r\nrules and systems. Their governments are arbitrary; the objects of their\r\npolicy are always shifting; they have no regular established system, the\r\neffect of which is to protect the weak against the strong; on the\r\ncontrary, the object of each of them separately, and of all of them\r\ntaken collectively, is to destroy the weak; and if by chance, they\r\nshould, by a sense of common danger, be induced for a season to combine\r\ntheir efforts for their mutual defence, the combination lasts only so\r\nlong as it is attended with success; the first reverse dissolves it;\r\nand, at all events, it is dissolved long before the danger ceases, the\r\napprehension of which originally caused it. The company's government in\r\nIndia, the other contracting party to their alliance, is one bound by\r\nall the rules and systems of European policy. The company's power in\r\nIndia is supposed to depend much upon its reputation; and although I do\r\nnot admit that it depends upon its reputation, as distinguished from its\r\nreal force, as appears to be contended by some, I may say that it is\r\nparticularly desirable for a government, so constituted as the\r\ncompany's, never to enter upon any particular object, the probable\r\nresult of which should not be greatly in favour of success.\r\n\r\nBesides this, the company's government in India is bound by acts of\r\nparliament not to undertake wars of aggression, not to make any but\r\ndefensive alliances, and those only in cases in which the other\r\ncontracting party shall bind itself to defend the possessions of the\r\ncompany actually threatened with hostilities.\r\n\r\nThe company's government in India is also connected with his majesty's\r\ngovernment, and, as an Asiatic power, is liable to be involved in wars\r\nwith European powers possessing territories in India, whenever his\r\nmajesty shall be at war with those powers.\r\n\r\nThe picture above drawn of the state of politics among Asiatic powers,\r\nproves that no permanent system can be adopted which will preserve the\r\nweak against the strong, and will keep all for any length of time in\r\ntheir relative situations, and the whole in peace; excepting there\r\nshould be one power, which, either by the superiority of its strength,\r\nits military system, or its resources, shall preponderate, and be able\r\nto protect all.\r\n\r\n_1804._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is necessary for a man who fills a public situation, and who has\r\ngreat public interests in charge, to lay aside all private\r\nconsiderations, whether on his own account or that of other persons.\r\n\r\n_March 2, 1804._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen war is concluded, all animosity should be forgotten.\r\n\r\n_March 12, 1804._\r\n\r\n_The British character for good faith must be preserved in India._\r\n\r\nI would sacrifice Gwalior, or every portion of India, ten times over, in\r\norder to preserve our credit for scrupulous good faith, and the\r\nadvantages and honour we gained by the late war and the peace: and we\r\nmust not fritter them away in arguments, drawn from overstrained\r\nprinciples of the laws of nations, which are not understood in this\r\ncountry. What brought me through many difficulties in the war, and the\r\nnegociations for peace? The British good faith, and nothing else.\r\n\r\n_Dispatch, March 17, 1804._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Civil Government in India must follow immediately on Military\r\nConquest._\r\n\r\nI rather think that you and the Governor-General agree in opinion on the\r\nsubject of the affairs of Malabar. He says, \"examine and report the\r\nstate of the province before you commence your military operations;\r\ndefine the evils, and propose a system of government which shall afford\r\na remedy, towards the establishment of which system military operations\r\nmay be directed.\"\r\n\r\nIt would be useless to commence military operations upon any great\r\nscale, unless the civil officers should be prepared to take possession\r\nof the country, and to re-establish the civil government as the troops\r\nshall conquer it. If the civil government were not re-established in\r\nthis manner, the rebels would rise again as soon as the troops would\r\npass through the districts; and the effect of the operations of a large\r\nbody of troops would be much the same as that of a small body. But if\r\nthe civil government is to be re-established in this manner, it would be\r\nbetter to establish that system which is found to be good, and is to be\r\npermanent, than that which is known to be had, and which is intended\r\nshould not last. Supposing that the bad system were first introduced, it\r\nmust be followed afterwards by the good one; and, supposing that the bad\r\nsystem did not produce a rebellion of itself (which I acknowledge I do\r\nnot think it would, as rebellion in Malabar is to be traced to causes\r\nentirely independent of all systems of civil government, excepting as\r\nthey are connected with a strong or weak military force), the change\r\nfrom the bad to the good system would produce a degree of convulsion,\r\nand, possibly, momentary weakness, which it is always desirable to\r\navoid. It is particularly desirable to avoid it in this instance, as it\r\nwill not be difficult, by an examination of all that has passed in\r\nMalabar, to fix upon the general principles according to which that\r\nprovince ought to be governed, and to form a system accordingly, in the\r\ntime which must elapse before the troops can he employed in settling the\r\nprovince.\r\n\r\n_March 20, 1804._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Principle of Relief to the Poor._\r\n\r\nThe principle, of the mode in which I propose to relieve the distresses\r\nof the inhabitants, is not to give grain or money in charity.\r\n\r\nThose who suffer from famine may properly be divided into two classes:\r\nthose who can, and those who cannot, work. In the latter class may be\r\nincluded old persons, children, and the sick women; who, from their\r\nformer situation in life, have been unaccustomed to labour, and are\r\nweakened by the effects of famine.\r\n\r\nThe former, viz., those of both sexes who can work, ought to be employed\r\nby the public; and in the course of this letter I shall point out the\r\nwork on which I should wish that they might be employed, and in what\r\nmanner paid. The latter, viz., those who cannot work, ought to be taken\r\ninto an hospital and fed, and receive medical aid and medicine at the\r\nexpense of the public.\r\n\r\nAccording to this mode of proceeding, subsistence will be provided for\r\nall; the public will receive some benefit from the expense which will be\r\nincurred, and, above all, it will be certain, that no able-bodied person\r\nwill apply for relief, unless he should be unwilling to work for his\r\nsubsistence, that none will apply who are able to work, and who are not\r\nreal objects of charity; and that none will come to Ahmednuggur for the\r\npurpose of partaking of the food which must be procured by the labour,\r\nor to obtain which they must submit to the restraint of an hospital.\r\n\r\n_Dispatch, April 11, 1804._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Tactics to be pursued against Predatory Troops_.\r\n\r\nI have served a good deal in this part of India against this description\r\nof freebooter; and I think that the best mode of operating, is to press\r\nhim with one or two corps capable of moving with tolerable celerity,\r\nand of such strength as to render the result of an action by no means\r\ndoubtful, if he should venture to risk one. There is but little hope, it\r\nis true, that he will risk an action, or that any one of these corps\r\nwill come up with him. The effect to be produced by this mode of\r\noperation is to oblige him to move constantly, and with great celerity.\r\nWhen reduced to this necessity, he cannot venture to stop to plunder the\r\ncountry, and he does comparatively but little mischief; at all events\r\nthe subsistence of his army becomes difficult and precarious, the\r\nhorsemen become dissatisfied, and they perceive that their situation is\r\nhopeless, and they desert in numbers daily; the freebooter ends by\r\nhaving with him only a few adherents, and he is reduced to such a state\r\nas to be liable to be taken by any small body of country horse, which\r\nare the fittest troops to be then employed against him.\r\n\r\nIn proportion as the body of our troops, to be employed against a\r\nfreebooter of this description, have the power of moving with celerity,\r\nwill such freebooter be distressed. Whenever the largest and most\r\nformidable bodies of them are hard pressed by our troops, the village\r\npeople attack them upon their rear and flanks, cut off stragglers, and\r\nwill not allow a man to enter their villages; because their villages\r\nbeing in some degree fortified, they know well that the freebooters dare\r\nnot wait the time which would be necessary to reduce them. When this is\r\nthe case, all their means of subsistence vanish, no resource remains\r\nexcepting to separate, and even this resource is attended by risk, as\r\nthe village people cut them off on their way to their homes.\r\n\r\n_Dispatch, May 27, 1804._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Importance of Secresy in Public Affairs_.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing more certain than that of one hundred affairs\r\nninety-nine might be posted up at the market-cross, without injury to\r\nthe public interests; but the misfortune is that where the public\r\nbusiness is the subject of general conversation, and is not kept a\r\nsecret, as a matter of course, upon every occasion, it is very difficult\r\nto keep it secret upon that occasion on which it is necessary. There is\r\nan awkwardness in a secret which enables discerning men (of which\r\ndescription there are always plenty in an army) invariably to find it\r\nout; and it may be depended upon that, whenever the public business\r\nought to be kept secret, it always suffers when it is exposed to public\r\nview. For this reason secresy is always best; and those who have been\r\nlong trusted with the conduct of public affairs are in the habit of\r\nnever making known public business of any description that it is not\r\nnecessary that the public should know. The consequence is that secresy\r\nbecomes natural to them, and as much a habit as it is to others to talk\r\nof public matters; and they have it in their power to keep things secret\r\nor not, as they may think proper.\r\n\r\nRemember that what I recommend to you is far removed from mystery; in\r\nfact, I recommend silence upon the public business upon all occasions,\r\nin order to avoid the necessity of mystery upon any.\r\n\r\n_Dispatch, June 28, 1804._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn all retreats, it must be recollected that they are safe and easy, in\r\nproportion to the number of attacks made by the retreating corps.\r\n\r\n_Dispatch, Sept. 12, 1804._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Neglect of his Services in India._\r\n\r\nIn regard to staying longer (in the Deccan), the question is exactly\r\nwhether the court of directors, or the king's ministers, have any claim\r\nupon me, strong enough to induce me to do anything so disagreeable to my\r\nfeelings (leaving health out of the question) as to remain, for a great\r\nlength of time, in this country. I have served the company in important\r\nsituations for many years, and have never received anything but injury\r\nfrom the court of directors, although I am a singular instance of an\r\nofficer who has served under all governments, and in communication with\r\nall the political residents, and many civil authorities; and there is\r\nnot an instance on record, or in any private correspondence, of\r\ndisapprobation of any of my acts, or a single complaint, or even a\r\nsymptom of ill-temper from any one of the political or civil authorities\r\nin communication with whom I have acted. The king's ministers have as\r\nlittle claim upon me as the court of directors. I am not very ambitious,\r\nand I acknowledge that I never have been very sanguine in my\r\nexpectations that military services in India would be considered in the\r\nscale in which are considered similar services in other parts of the\r\nworld. But I might have expected to be placed on the staff in India; and\r\nyet if it had not been for the lamented death of General Fraser, General\r\nSmith's arrival would have made me supernumerary.

At the same time I\r\nmust agree with you in thinking that affairs are now in so desperate a\r\nsituation that they cannot be worse; that there is a real want of men of\r\ncommon capacity in Spain, in whose hands any form of government,\r\nintended for vigorous action, could be placed with any hope that their\r\npowers could he used to the public advantage; and that the Cortes, with\r\nall their faults, and the dangers attendant upon such an assembly, will\r\nhave at least this advantage, that they will have the confidence of the\r\ncountry, and the prejudices of their countrymen of the lower class in\r\nour favour, and against France; the remark being perfectly well founded,\r\nthat there is no prejudice or jealousy of us any where in Spain\r\nexcepting by the government.\r\n\r\nBut in order to enjoy common safety under such an assembly as the\r\nSpanish Cortes, the rules and orders for their proceedings and internal\r\ngovernment ought to be well defined, and to be, if possible, a part of\r\nthe constitution of the assembly. Great care should also be taken in\r\ntheir formation to protect them from the effects of popular fury in the\r\nplace of their sitting; but still with all these precautions I should\r\nprefer a wise Bourbon, if we could find one, for a regent, to the\r\nCortes.\r\n\r\n_Dispatch, Sept. 22, 1809._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhatever may be eventually the fate of Spain, Portugal must be a\r\nmilitary country.\r\n\r\n_Dispatch, Sept. 24, 1809._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Military Value of an Armed and Friendly People._\r\n\r\nIn respect to the army and armament of the people in Spain and Portugal,\r\nthere is no man more aware than I am of the advantage to be derived from\r\nthese measures; and if I had not reflected well upon the subject, my\r\nexperience of the war in Portugal and in Spain--(in Portugal, where the\r\npeople are in some degree armed and arrayed; and in Spain, where they\r\nare not)--would have shewn me the advantage which an army has against\r\nthe enemy when the people are armed and arrayed, and are on its side in\r\nthe contest. But reflection, and, above all, experience have shewn me\r\nthe exact extent of this advantage in a military point of view; and I\r\nonly beg that those who have to contend with the French, will not be\r\ndiverted from the business of raising, arming, equipping, and training\r\nregular bodies, by any notion that the people, when armed and arrayed,\r\nwill be of, I will not say any, but of much use to them.\r\n\r\n_Dispatch, Oct. 11, 1809._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Difficulties in the Peninsular War.

The battle of\r\nTalevera was certainly the hardest fought of modern days, and the most\r\nglorious in its results to our troops. Each side engaged lost a quarter\r\nof their numbers.\r\n\r\nIt is lamentable that, owing to the miserable inefficiency of the\r\nSpaniards, to their want of exertion, and the deficiency of numbers,\r\neven, of the allies, much more of discipline and every other military\r\nquality, when compared with the enemy in the Peninsula, the glory of the\r\naction is the only benefit we have derived from it. But that is a solid\r\nand substantial benefit, of which we have derived some good consequences\r\nalready; for, strange to say, I have contrived with the little British\r\narmy to keep everything in check since the month of August last; and if\r\nthe Spaniards had not contrived, by their own folly and against my\r\nentreaties and remonstrances, to lose an army in La Mancha about a\r\nfortnight ago, I think we might have brought them through the contest;\r\nas it is, however, I do not despair. I have in hand a most difficult\r\ntask, from which I may not extricate myself; but I must not shrink from\r\nit, I command an unanimous army; I draw well with all the authorities in\r\nSpain and Portugal; and I believe I have the good wishes of the whole\r\nworld. In such circumstances, one may fail, but it would be\r\ndishonourable to shrink from the task.\r\n\r\n_Letter to Col.

Recent\r\ntransactions in Holland shew that it is all hollow within; and that it\r\nis so inconsistent with the wishes, the interests, and even the\r\nexistence of civilized society, that he cannot trust even his brothers\r\nto carry it into execution.\r\n\r\n_Dispatch, April 4, 1810._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Military Law the will of the General._\r\n\r\nMilitary law, as applied to any persons excepting the officers,\r\nsoldiers, and followers of the army, for whose government there are\r\nparticular provisions of law in all well regulated countries, is neither\r\nmore nor less than the will of the general of the army. He punishes\r\neither with or without trial, for crimes either declared to be so, or\r\nnot so declared, by any existing law, or by his own orders. This is the\r\nplain and common meaning of the term military law. Besides the mode of\r\nproceeding above described, laws have been made in different countries\r\nat different times to establish and legalize a description of military\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\nThe commander-in-chief, or the government, has been authorized to\r\nproceed by military process--that is, by court martial or council of\r\nwar--against persons offending against certain laws, or against their\r\nown orders, issued generally for the security of the army; or for the\r\nestablishment of a certain government or constitution odious to the\r\npeople among whom it is established.\r\n\r\nOf both descriptions of military law, there are numerous instances in\r\nthe history of the operations of the French army during the revolution;\r\nand there is an instance of the existence both of the first-mentioned\r\ndescription and of the last-mentioned in Ireland, during the rebellion\r\nof 1798, when the people were in insurrection against the government,\r\nand were to be restrained by force.\r\n\r\n_Dispatch, April 19, 1810._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Letter to a Portuguese of Rank on the Position and Duties of Persons in\r\nhis station._\r\n\r\nI have received your letter containing a complaint against----, of the\r\nquarter-master general's department, that he had ill-treated one of your\r\nservants, into which I shall make inquiry, and let you know the result.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is impossible, however, for me to interfere in any manner with a\r\nbillet, given by the magistrates of Coimbra, for an officer and his\r\nfamily to be quartered in your house. I must at the same time inform\r\nyou, that I am not a little surprised that a person of your rank and\r\nstation, and quality in the country, should object to give accommodation\r\nin your house, and should make a complaint of this officer, that he had\r\nasked you for additional accommodation, when it appears by the letter\r\nwhich you enclosed, and which I now return, that when you objected to\r\ngive him this additional accommodation for which he asked, he acquiesced\r\nin your objection, and did not any longer require this accommodation.\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate situation in which Portugal is placed, and the desire of\r\nthe insatiable enemy of mankind to force this once happy and loyal\r\npeople to submit to his iron yoke, to plunder them of their properties\r\nto destroy their religion and to deprive them of their monarch, has\r\nrendered it necessary to collect in this country a large army, in order,\r\nif possible, to defeat and frustrate the designs of the enemy. It is the\r\nduty of those whose age, whose sex, or whose profession, do not permit\r\nthem to take an active part in the defence of their country, to assist\r\nthose employed in its defence with provisions, lodgings for officers and\r\ntroops, means of transport, &c., and at all events not to oppose\r\nthemselves to the granting of this description of assistance. These\r\nduties are more particularly incumbent upon the rich and high in\r\nstation, who would be the first victims of, and greatest sufferers\r\nfrom, the enemy's success, unless, indeed, they should be of the number\r\nof those traitors who are aiding to introduce the common enemy into the\r\ncountry, to destroy its happiness and independence.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances I am not a little astonished to receive these\r\nfrivolous and manifestly unfounded complaints from you, and that you\r\nshould be the person to set the example of objecting to give quarters to\r\nan officer, because he is married and has children.\r\n\r\nIt is not very agreeable to anybody to have strangers quartered in his\r\nhouse; nor is it very agreeable to us strangers, who have good houses in\r\nour own country, to be obliged to seek for quarters here. We are not\r\nhere for our pleasure; the situation of your country renders it\r\nnecessary: and you, a man of family and fortune, who have much to lose,\r\nshould not be the first to complain of the inconvenience of our presence\r\nin the country.\r\n\r\nI do everything in my power to alleviate the inconvenience which all\r\nmust suffer. We pay extravagant prices with unparalleled punctuality for\r\neverything we receive; and I make it a rule to inquire into and redress\r\nevery injury that is really done by the troops under my command, as I\r\nshall that to which I have above referred, of which you complain, in the\r\nconduct of----towards your servant.\r\n\r\n_Dispatch, August 23, 1810._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Croaking Spirit in the British Army in Portugal_.\r\n\r\nIt appears that you have had a good smart contest with the government\r\nrespecting our plan of operations. They will end in forcing me to quit\r\nthem, and then they will see how they will get on. They will then find\r\nthat I alone keep things in their present state. Indeed the temper of\r\nsome of the officers of the British army gives me more concern than the\r\nfolly of the Portuguese government. I have always been accustomed to\r\nhave the confidence and support of the officers of the armies which I\r\nhave commanded; but for the first time, whether owing to the opposition\r\nin England, or whether the magnitude of the concern is too much for\r\ntheir minds and their nerves, or whether I am mistaken and they are\r\nright, I cannot tell; but there is a system of croaking in the army\r\nwhich is highly injurious to the public service, and which I must devise\r\nsome means to put an end to, or it will put an end to us. Officers have\r\na right to form their own opinions upon events and transactions, but\r\nofficers of high rank or situation ought to keep their opinions to\r\nthemselves; if they do not approve of the system of operations of their\r\ncommander, they ought to withdraw from the army. And this is a point to\r\nwhich I must bring some, if I should not find that their own good sense\r\nprevents them from going on as they have done lately. Believe me that if\r\nany body else, knowing what I do, had commanded the army, they would now\r\nhave been in Lisbon, if not, in their ships.\r\n\r\n_Dispatch, September 11, 1810._\r\n\r\n_Note_--This passage from a letter to the British minister at Lisbon is\r\none of many, which explain the difficulties Lord Wellington had to\r\nencounter from the Portuguese Government, from the opposition and the\r\npress in England, and from the want of proper military spirit in his own\r\nofficers.\r\n\r\n_Conduct of the Portuguese._\r\n\r\nIf we are to go on as we have hitherto; if Great Britain is to give\r\nlarge subsidies, and to expend large sums in the support of a cause in\r\nwhich these most interested sit by and take no part; and those at the\r\nhead of the government, with laws and power to force the people to\r\nexertion in the critical circumstances in which the country is placed,\r\nare aware of the evil, but neglect their duty and omit to put the laws\r\ninto execution, I must believe their professions to be false; that they\r\nlook to a little dirty popularity instead of to save their country; that\r\nthey are unfaithful servants to their master, and persons in whom his\r\nallies can place no confidence.\r\n\r\n_Oct. 28, 1810._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The National Disease of Spain._\r\n\r\nThe national disease of Spain, that is, boasting of the strength and\r\npower of the Spanish nation, till they are seriously convinced that they\r\nare in no danger, then sitting down quietly and indulging their national\r\nindolence.\r\n\r\n_Dec. 2, 1810._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Apathy of the Portuguese._\r\n\r\nThere exists in the people of Portugal, an unconquerable love of their\r\nease, which is superior even to their fear and detestation of the enemy.\r\nNeither will they, or their magistrates, or the government, see that the\r\ntemporary indulgence of this passion for tranquillity must occasion the\r\ngreatest misfortunes to the state and hardships to the individuals\r\nthemselves; and no person in the country likes to have his tranquillity\r\nand habits disturbed for any purpose, however important, or to be the\r\ninstrument of disturbing those of others. Thus every arrangement is\r\ndefeated, and every order disobeyed with impunity. The magistrate will\r\nnot force the inhabitants to adopt a measure, however beneficial to the\r\nstate and himself, which will disturb his old habits; and the government\r\nwill not force the magistrate to do that which will be disagreeable to\r\nhim and to the people: thus we shall go on till the end of time.\r\n\r\n_January 3, 1811._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Takes no Notice of Newspapers._\r\n\r\nI hope that the opinions of the people in Great Britain are not\r\ninfluenced by paragraphs in newspapers, and that those paragraphs do not\r\nconvey the public opinion or sentiment upon any subject: therefore I\r\n(who have more reason than any other public man of the present day to\r\ncomplain of libels of this description) never take the smallest notice\r\nof them; and have never authorized any contradiction to be given, or any\r\nstatement to be made in answer to the innumerable falsehoods, and the\r\nheaps of false reasoning, which have been published respecting me and\r\nthe operations which I have directed.\r\n\r\n_January 7, 1811._\r\n\r\n_Indolence of the Natives of the Peninsula._\r\n\r\nThere is something very extraordinary in the nature of the people of the\r\nPeninsula. I really believe them, those of Portugal particularly, to be\r\nthe most loyal and best disposed, and the most cordial haters of the\r\nFrench, that ever existed; but there is an indolence and a want even of\r\nthe power of exertion in their disposition and habits, either for their\r\nown security, that of their country, or of their allies, which baffle\r\nall our calculations and efforts.\r\n\r\n_January 16, 1811._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Different Constitution of the French and English Armies._\r\n\r\nIt may also be asked why should we spend our money, and why these troops\r\nshould not go on as the French troops do, without pay, provisions,\r\nmagazines, or any thing? The French army is certainly a wonderful\r\nmachine; but if we are to form such a one, we must form such a\r\ngovernment as exists in France, which can with impunity lose one-half of\r\nthe troops employed in the field every year, only by the privations and\r\nhardships imposed upon them. Next, we most compose our army of soldiers\r\ndrawn from all classes of the population of the country; from the good\r\nand middling, as well as in rank as education, as from the bad; and not\r\nas all other nations do, and we in particular, from the bad only.\r\nThirdly, we must establish such a system of discipline as the French\r\nhave; a system founded on the strength of the tyranny of the government,\r\nwhich operates upon an army composed of soldiers, the majority of whom\r\nare sober, well disposed, amenable to order, and in some degree\r\neducated.\r\n\r\nWhen we shall have done all this, and shall have made these armies of\r\nthe strength of those employed by the French, we may require of them to\r\nlive as the French do, viz., by authorised and regular plunder of the\r\ncountry and its inhabitants, if any should remain; and we may expose\r\nthem to the labour, hardships and privations which the French soldier\r\nsuffers every day; and we must expect the same proportion of loss every\r\ncampaign, viz., one-half of those who take field.\r\n\r\n_January 26, 1811._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Character of the Marques de la Romana._\r\n\r\nIn him the Spanish army have lost their brightest ornament, his country\r\ntheir most upright patriot, and the world the most strenuous and zealous\r\ndefender of the cause in which we are engaged; and I shall always\r\nacknowledge with gratitude the assistance which I received from him, as\r\nwell by his operations as by his counsel, since he had been joined with\r\nthis army.\r\n\r\n_January 26, 1811._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_None but the worst men enter the Army as Privates._\r\n\r\nIn respect to recruiting the army, my own opinion is, that the\r\ngovernment have never taken an enlarged view of the subject. It is\r\nexpected that people will become soldiers in the line, and leave their\r\nfamilies to starve, when, if they become soldiers in the militia, their\r\nfamilies are provided for. This is an inconsistency that must strike the\r\nmind of even the least reflecting of mankind. What is the consequence?\r\nThat none but the worst description of men enter the regular service.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut admitting the truth of the expense, I say that the country has not a\r\nchoice between army and no army, between peace or war. They must have a\r\nlarge and efficient army, one capable of meeting the enemy abroad, or\r\nthey must expect to meet him at home; and then farewell to all\r\nconsiderations of measures of greater or lesser expense, and to the\r\nease, the luxury, and happiness of England. God forbid that I should see\r\nthe day on which hostile armies should contend within the United\r\nKingdom; but I am very certain that I shall not only see that day, but\r\nshall be a party in the contest, unless we alter our system, and the\r\npublic feel in time the real nature of the contest in which we are at\r\npresent engaged, and determine to meet its expense. I have gone a little\r\nbeyond the question of recruiting; but depend upon it that you will get\r\nmen when you provide for the families of soldiers in the line and not in\r\nthe militia, and not before.\r\n\r\n_January 28, 1811._\r\n\r\n_Buonaparte's \"disgusting Tyranny.\"_\r\n\r\nI am glad to hear such good accounts of affairs in the North. God send\r\nthat they may prove true, and that we may overthrow this disgusting\r\ntyranny: however, of this I am certain, that whether true or not at\r\npresent, something of the kind must occur before long, and, if we can\r\nonly hold out, we shall yet see the world relieved.\r\n\r\n_March 23, 1811._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_A French army in England would be the consequence of our withdrawal\r\nfrom the Peninsula._\r\n\r\nI shall be sorry if government should think themselves under the\r\nnecessity of withdrawing from this country, on account of the expense of\r\nthe contest. From what I have seen of the objects of the French\r\ngovernment, and the sacrifices they make to accomplish them, I have no\r\ndoubt that if the British army were for any reason to withdraw from the\r\nPeninsula, and the French government were relieved from the pressure of\r\nmilitary operations on the Continent, they would incur all risks to land\r\nan army in his majesty's dominions. Then indeed would commence an\r\nexpensive contest; then his majesty's subjects discover what are the\r\nmiseries of war, of which, by the blessing of God, they have hitherto\r\nhad no knowledge; and the cultivation, the beauty, and prosperity of the\r\ncountry, and the virtue and happiness of its inhabitants, would be\r\ndestroyed: whatever might be the result of the military operations; God\r\nforbid that I should be a witness, much less an actor, in the scene.[6]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: At this time the clamours of the opposition regarding the\r\nexpense of the war induced a fear that the government might determine to\r\ndiscontinue it.]\r\n\r\n_March 23, 1811._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The Peninsular Governments must not mind unpopularity._\r\n\r\nI recommend to them (the Spaniards and Portuguese) to advert seriously\r\nto the nature of the task which they have to perform. Popularity,\r\nhowever desirable it may be to individuals, will not form, or feed, or\r\npay an army; will not enable it to march and fight; will not keep it in\r\na state of efficiency for long and arduous services. The resources which\r\na wise government must find for these objects must be drawn from the\r\npeople, not by measures which will render those unpopular who undertake\r\nto govern a country in critical circumstances, but by measures which\r\nmust for a moment have a contrary effect. The enthusiasm of the people\r\nin favour of any individual never saved any country. They must be\r\nobliged by the restraint of law and regulation, to do those things and\r\nto pay those contributions, which are to enable the government to carry\r\non this necessary contest.\r\n\r\n_April 9, 1811._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Coolness in action, not headlong bravery, is required in the Army._\r\n\r\nThe desire to be forward in engaging the enemy is not uncommon in the\r\nBritish array; but that quality which I wish to see the officers\r\npossess, who are at the head of the troops, is a cool, discriminating\r\njudgment in action, which will enable them to decide with promptitude\r\nhow far they can and ought to go, with propriety; and to convey their\r\norders, and act with such vigour and decision, that the soldiers will\r\nlook up to them with confidence in the moment of action, and obey them\r\nwith alacrity.\r\n\r\n_May 15, 1811._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The battle of Albuera one of the most glorious in the War._\r\n\r\nYou will have heard of the Marshal's (Beresford) action on the 16th. The\r\nfighting was desperate, and the loss of the British has been very\r\nsevere; but, adverting to the nature of the contest, and the manner in\r\nwhich they held their ground against all the efforts the whole French\r\narmy could make against them, notwithstanding all the losses which they\r\nhad sustained, I think this action one of the most glorious, and\r\nhonourable to the character of the troops, of any that has been fought\r\nduring the war.\r\n\r\n_May 20, 1811._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Portuguese Troops, better than Spanish._\r\n\r\nWhat a pity it is that the Spaniards will not set to work seriously to\r\ndiscipline their troops! We do what we please now with the Portuguese\r\ntroops; we manoeuvre them under fire equally with our own, and have some\r\ndependence on them; but these Spaniards can do nothing but stand still,\r\nand we consider ourselves fortunate if they do not run away.\r\n\r\n_May 25, 1811._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Disorganized state of the Peninsular Governments._\r\n\r\nThose unfortunate governments in the Peninsula have been reduced to such\r\na state of decrepitude, that I believe there was no authority existing\r\nwithin Spain or Portugal before the French invaded these countries. The\r\nFrench invasion did not improve this state of things; and, since what is\r\ncalled in Spain the revolution, and in Portugal the restoration, no\r\ncrime that I know of has been punished in either, excepting that of\r\nbeing a French partisan. Those malversations in office--those neglects\r\nof duty; the disobedience of orders; the inattention to regulation,\r\nwhich tend to defeat all plans for military operation, and ruin a state\r\nthat is involved in war, more certainly than the plots of all the French\r\npartisans, are passed unnoticed; and, notwithstanding the numerous\r\ncomplaints which Marshal Beresford and I have made, I do not know that\r\none individual has yet been punished, or even dismissed from his\r\noffice. The cause of this evil is the mistaken principle on which the\r\ngovernment have proceeded. They have imagined that the best foundation\r\nfor their power was a low, vulgar popularity; the evidence is the shouts\r\nof the mob of Lisbon, and the regular attendance at their levees, and\r\nthe bows and scrapes of people in office, who ought to have other modes\r\nof spending their time; and to obtain this babble the government of\r\nPortugal, as well as the successive governments in Spain, have neglected\r\nto perform those essential duties of all governments, viz., to force\r\nthose they are placed over to do their duty, by which, before this time,\r\nthese countries would have been out of danger.\r\n\r\nThe other evil is connected very materially with the first. The\r\ngovernment will not regulate their finances, because it will interfere\r\nwith some man's job. They will not lay on new taxes, because in all\r\ncountries those who lay on taxes are not favourites with the mob. They\r\nhave a general income-tax, called 10 per cent., and, in some cases, 20\r\nper cent., which they have regulated in such a manner as that no\r\nindividual, I believe, has paid a hundredth part of what he ought to\r\nhave paid. Then, for want of money, they can pay nobody, and, of course,\r\nhave not the influence which they ought to have over the subordinate\r\ndepartments.\r\n\r\nIn addition to embarrassments of all descriptions surrounding us on all\r\nsides, I have to contend with an ancient enmity between these two\r\nnations, which is more like that of cat and dog than anything else, of\r\nwhich no sense of common danger, or common interest, or anything, can\r\nget the better, even in individuals.\r\n\r\n_June 12, 1811._\r\n\r\nTo write an anonymous letter is the meanest action of which any man can\r\nbe guilty.\r\n\r\n_Dispatch, July 3, 1811._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_British Officers, as well at Soldiers, require to be kept in order._\r\n\r\nI must also observe that British officers require to be kept in order,\r\nas well as the soldiers under their command, particularly in a foreign\r\nservice. The experience which I have had of their conduct in the\r\nPortuguese service has shown me that there must be authority, and that a\r\nstrong one, to keep them within due bounds, otherwise they would only\r\ndisgust the soldiers over whom they should be placed, the officers whom\r\nthey should be destined to assist, and the country in whose service they\r\nshould be employed.\r\n\r\n_October 1, 1811._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Money in aid of Labour better than Charity._\r\n\r\nThat which would be desirable is, if possible, to aid laborious\r\nexertions to procure a subsistence by small advances of money; and I\r\npropose to keep this principle in view in the distribution of the money\r\nentrusted to me, by which not only it will subsist those to whom it will\r\nbe given for a longer period, but it may be hoped that the people will\r\nresume their habits of industry, and that they will soon again be able\r\nto provide for their own subsistence.\r\n\r\n_Oct. 11, 1811._\r\n\r\n_A General Re-action against Buonaparte predicted._\r\n\r\nI have, however, long considered it probable, that even _we_ should\r\nwitness a general resistance throughout Europe to the fraudulent and\r\ndisgusting tyranny of Buonaparte, created by the example of what has\r\noccurred in Spain and Portugal; and that _we_ should be actors and\r\nadvisers in these scenes; and I have reflected frequently upon the\r\nmeasures which should be pursued to give a chance of success.\r\n\r\nThose who embark in projects of this description should be made to\r\nunderstand, or to act as if they understood, that having once drawn the\r\nsword they must not return it, till they shall have completely\r\naccomplished their object. They must be prepared, and must be forced, to\r\nmake all sacrifices to the cause. Submission to military discipline and\r\norder is a matter of course; but when a nation determines to resist the\r\nauthority, and to shake off the government of Buonaparte, they must be\r\nprepared and forced to sacrifice the luxuries and comforts of life, and\r\nto risk all in a contest, which it should be clearly understood before\r\nit is undertaken, has for its object to save all or nothing.\r\n\r\nThe first measure for a country to adopt is to form an army, and to\r\nraise a revenue from the people to defray the expense of the army:\r\nabove all, to form a government of such strength, as that army and\r\npeople can be forced by it to perform their duty. This is the rock upon\r\nwhich Spain has split; and all our measures in any other country which\r\nshould afford hopes of resistance to Buonaparte should be directed to\r\navoid it. The enthusiasm of the people is very fine, and looks well in\r\nprint; but I have never known it to produce any thing but confusion. In\r\nFrance, what was called enthusiasm was power and tyranny, acting through\r\nthe medium of popular societies, which have ended by overturning Europe,\r\nand in establishing the most powerful and dreadful tyranny that ever\r\nexisted. In Spain, the enthusiasm of the people spent itself in _vivas_\r\nand vain boasting. The notion of its existence prevented even the\r\nattempt to discipline the armies; and its existence has been alleged,\r\never since, as the excuse for the rank ignorance of the officers and the\r\nindiscipline and constant misbehaviour of the troops.\r\n\r\nI therefore earnestly recommend you, wherever you go, to trust nothing\r\nto the enthusiasm of the people. Give them a strong and a just, and, if\r\npossible, a good government; but, above all, a strong one, which shall\r\nenforce upon them to do their duty by themselves and their country; and\r\nlet measures of finance to support an army go hand in hand with measures\r\nto raise it.\r\n\r\nI am quite certain that the finances of Great Britain are more than a\r\nmatch for Buonaparte, and that we shall have the means of aiding any\r\ncountry that may be disposed to resist his tyranny. But those means are\r\nnecessarily limited in every country by the difficulty of procuring\r\nspecie. This necessary article can be obtained in sufficient quantities\r\nonly by the contributions of the people; and although Great Britain can\r\nand ought to assist with money, as well as in other modes, every effort\r\nof this description, the principal financial as well as military effort,\r\nought to be by the people of the resisting country.\r\n\r\n_Dec. 10, 1811._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The French System of Predatory War._\r\n\r\nIn the early days of the revolutionary war, the French, at the\r\nrecommendation, I believe, of Brissot, adopted a measure which they\r\ncalled a _levée en masse_; and put every man, animal, and article, in\r\ntheir own country, in requisition for the service of the armies. This\r\nsystem of plunder was carried into execution by the popular societies\r\nthroughout the country. It is not astonishing that a nation, among whom\r\nsuch a system was established, should have been anxious to carry on the\r\nwar beyond their own frontiers. This system both created the desire and\r\nafforded the means of success; and with the war, they carried, wherever\r\nthey went, the system of requisition; not, however, before they had, by\r\nthese and other revolutionary measures, entirely destroyed all the\r\nsources of national prosperity at home.\r\n\r\nWherever the French armies have since gone, their subsistence, at least,\r\nthe most expensive article in all armies, and means of transport, have\r\nbeen received from the country for nothing. Sometimes, besides\r\nsubsistence, they have received clothing and shoes; in other instances,\r\nbesides these articles, they have received pay; and from Austria and\r\nPrussia, and other parts of Germany and Italy, they have drawn, besides\r\nall these articles of supply for their troops, heavy contributions in\r\nmoney for the supply of the treasury at Paris. To this enumeration ought\r\nto be added the plunder acquired by the generals, officers, and troops;\r\nand it will be seen that the new French system of war is the greatest\r\nevil that ever fell on the civilised world.\r\n\r\nThe capital and industry of France having been destroyed by the\r\nrevolution, it is obvious that the government cannot raise a revenue\r\nfrom the people of France adequate to support the large force which must\r\nbe maintained in order to uphold the authority of the new government,\r\nparticularly in the newly-conquered or ceded states; and to defend the\r\nwidely-extended frontier of France from all those whose interest and\r\ninclination must lead them to attack it. The French government,\r\ntherefore, under whatever form administered, must seek for support for\r\ntheir armies in foreign countries. War must be a financial resource; and\r\nthat appears to me to be the greatest misfortune which the French\r\nrevolution has entailed upon the present generation.\r\n\r\n_Jan. 31, 1812._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI consider the Portuguese troops, next to the British, the best in the\r\nPeninsula.\r\n\r\n_May 3, 1812._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is very difficult to manage the defence of the kingdom of Portugal,\r\nthe whole country being frontier.\r\n\r\n_June 11, 1812._\r\n\r\n_How to establish National Credit._\r\n\r\nWhen a nation is desirous of establishing public credit, or, in other\r\nwords, of inducing individuals to confide their property to its\r\ngovernment, they must begin by acquiring a revenue equal to their fixed\r\nexpenditure; and they must manifest an inclination to be honest, by\r\nperforming their engagements in respect to their debts.\r\n\r\n_June 25. 1812._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The Spaniards cry \"Viva!\" but don't act._\r\n\r\nI do not expect much from the exertions of the Spaniards,\r\nnotwithstanding all that we have done for them. They cry _viva!_ and are\r\nvery fond of us, and hate the French; but they are, in general, the most\r\nincapable of useful exertion of all the nations that I have ever known;\r\nthe most vain, and at the same time the most ignorant, particularly of\r\nmilitary affairs, and above all of military affairs in their own\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n_August 18, 1812._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Imbecility of the Spanish Leaders._\r\n\r\nIt is extraordinary that the revolution in Spain should not have\r\nproduced one man with any knowledge of the real situation of the\r\ncountry.

Those measures are particularly popular which deprive rich and\r\npowerful individuals of their properties under the pretence of the\r\npublic advantage; and I tremble for a country in which, as in Spain,\r\nthere is no barrier for the preservation of private property, excepting\r\nthe justice of a legislative assembly possessing supreme powers.\r\n\r\n_January 29, 1813._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Ingratitude of the Portuguese to the British Army._\r\n\r\nI must say, that the British army, which I have the honour to command,\r\nhave met with nothing but ingratitude from the government and\r\nauthorities in Portugal for their services; and that everything that\r\ncould be done has been done by the civil authorities, lately, to oppress\r\nthe officers and soldiers on every occasion in which it has by any\r\naccident been in their power.

In such countries as America,\r\nvery extensive, thinly peopled, and producing but little food in\r\nproportion to their extent, military operations by large bodies are\r\nimpracticable, unless the party carrying them on has the uninterrupted\r\nuse of a navigable river, or very extensive means of land transport,\r\nwhich such a country can rarely supply.\r\n\r\nI conceive, therefore, that were your army larger even than the proposed\r\naugmentation would make it, you could not quit the lakes; and, indeed,\r\nwould be tied to them the more necessarily in proportion as your army\r\nwould be large.[7]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: The letter from the Duke the above is taken was written in\r\nreply to an application by the home government for his opinion.

Nobody reads anything but the newspapers; but it\r\nis impossible to get anything inserted in any French newspaper in Paris\r\nin favour of the abolition, or even to show that the trade was abolished\r\nin England, from motives of humanity. The extracts made from English\r\nnewspapers upon this, or any other subject, are selected with a view,\r\neither to turn our principles and conduct into ridicule, or to\r\nexasperate against us still more the people of this country; and\r\ntherefore the evil cannot be remedied by good publications in the daily\r\npress in England, with a view to their being copied into the newspapers\r\nhere.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI must say that the daily press in England do us a good deal of harm in\r\nthis as well as in other questions.

Tous doivent donc nécessairement viser à remplir des emplois\r\npublics, non, comme autrefois, pour l'honneur de les remplir, mais pour\r\navoir de quoi vivre. Tout le monde donc cherche de l'emploi public.\r\n\r\nBuonaparte laissa une armée de million d'hommes en France, outres les\r\nofficiers prisonniers en Angleterre et en Russie. Le roi ne peut pas en\r\nmaintenir le quart. Tous ceux non employées sont mécontens. Buonaparte\r\ngouvernait directement la moitié de l'Europe, et indirectement presque\r\nl'autre moitié. Pour des causes à présent bien develloppées et connues,\r\nil employait une quantité infinie de personnes dans ses administrations;\r\net tous ceux employés, ou dans les administrations extérieures, civiles,\r\nou dans les administrations militaires des armées, sont renvoyés, et\r\nbeaucoup des ceux employés dans les administrations intérieures; à cette\r\nclasse nombreuse ajouter la quantité d'émigrés, et de personnes rentrés,\r\ntous mourant de faim, et tous convoitant de l'emploi public afin de\r\npouvoir vivre, et vous trouverez que plus des trois quarts de la classe\r\nde la société, non employée à la main d'oeuvre ou à labourer la terre,\r\nsont en état d'indigence, et, par conséquence, mécontens. Si vous\r\nconsiderez bien ce tableau, qui est la stricte vérité, vous y verrez la\r\ncause et la nature du danger du jour. L'armée les officiers, sourtout,\r\nsont mécontens.

The\r\nestablishment of any other government, whether in the person of----, or\r\nin a regency in the name of young Napoleon, or in any other individual,\r\nor in a republic, must lead to the maintenance of large military\r\nestablishments, to the ruin of all the governments of Europe, till it\r\nshall suit the convenience of the French government to commence a\r\ncontest which can be directed only against you, or others for whom we\r\nare interested. In this contest we shall feel the additional difficulty,\r\nthat those who are now on our side will then be against us, and you will\r\nagain find yourself surrounded by enemies. I am convinced that the\r\npenetration of your highness will have shewn you the danger of all these\r\nschemes to the interests of the emperor, and that you will defeat them\r\nall by adhering to that line of conduct (in which you will find us\r\nlikewise) which will finally lead to the establishment in France of the\r\nlegitimate government, from which alone can Europe expect any genuine\r\npeace.\r\n\r\n_May 20, 1815._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Effects of Waterloo._\r\n\r\nI may be wrong, but my opinion is, that we have given Napoleon his\r\ndeath-blow: from all I hear, his army is totally destroyed, the men are\r\ndeserting in parties, even the generals are withdrawing from him. The\r\ninfantry throw away their arms, and the cavalry and artillery sell their\r\nhorses to the people of the country, and desert to their homes. Allowing\r\nfor much exaggeration in this account, and knowing that Buonaparte can\r\nstill collect, in addition to what he has brought back with him, the 5th\r\ncorps d'armée, under Rapp, which is near Strasbourg, and the 3rd corps,\r\nwhich was at Wavre during the battle, and has not suffered so much as\r\nthe others, and probably some troops from La Vendée, I am still of\r\nopinion that he can make no head against us--qu'il n'a qu'à se pendre.\r\n\r\n_June 23, 1815._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSome of the regiments (the new ones I mean) are reduced to nothing; but\r\nI must keep them as regiments, to the great inconvenience of the\r\nservice, at great expense; or I must send them home, and part with the\r\nfew British soldiers I have.\r\n\r\nI never was so disgusted with any concern as I am with this; and I only\r\nhope that I am going the right way to bring it to an early determination\r\nsome way or other.\r\n\r\n_June 25, 1815._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Waterloo described to a Soldier._\r\n\r\nNotre Bataille du 18 a été une de géans; et notre succès a été complet,\r\ncomme vous voyez.

It is not\r\nmerely a military measure, but is one likely to attach to the character\r\nof our operations, and is of political importance. It is adopted solely\r\nbecause the bridge is considered as a monument of the battle of Jena,\r\nnotwithstanding that the government are willing to change the name of\r\nthe bridge. Considering the bridge as a monument, I beg leave to suggest\r\nthat its immediate destruction is inconsistent with the promise made to\r\nthe commissioners on behalf of the part of the army, during the\r\nnegociation of the convention, viz., that the monuments, museums, &c.,\r\nshould be reserved for the decision of the allied sovereigns.\r\n\r\nAll that I ask is, that the execution of the orders given for the\r\ndestruction of the bridge may be suspended till the sovereigns shall\r\narrive here, when, if it should be agreed by common accord that the\r\nbridge ought to be destroyed, I shall have no objection.\r\n\r\n_July 9, 1815._[8]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: The Duke rarely writes or speaks twice, when once will do.\r\nOn this occasion he was anxious; and--successful.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Summary Justice._\r\n\r\nTo the Sous-Préfet de Pontoise.--J'ai ordonné qu'on vous fasse\r\nprisonnier, parceque, ayant envoyé une réquisition à Pontoise pour des\r\nvivres, vous avez répondu que vous ne les donneriez pas, sans qu'on\r\nenvoie une force militaire assez forte pour les prendre.\r\n\r\nVous vous êtes mis dans les cas des militaires, et je vous fais\r\nprisonnier de guerre, et je vous envoie en Angleterre.\r\n\r\nSi je vous traitais comme l'usurpateur et ses adherens ont traité les\r\nhabitans des pays ou ils ont fait la guerre, je vous ferais fusiller;\r\nmais, comme vous vous êtes constitué guerrier, je vous fais prisonnier\r\nde guerre.\r\n\r\n_July 13, 1815._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Characteristic Letter to Marshal Beresford_.\r\n\r\nThe battle of Waterloo was certainly the hardest fought that has been\r\nfor many years, I believe, and has placed in the power of the allies the\r\nmost important results. We are throwing them away, however, by the\r\ninfamous conduct of some of us; and I am sorry to add that our own\r\ngovernment also are taking up a little too much the tone of their\r\nrascally newspapers. They are shifting their objects; and, having got\r\ntheir cake, they want both to eat it and keep it.\r\n\r\nAs for your Portuguese concerns, I recommend you to resign, and come\r\naway immediately. It is impossible for the British government to\r\nmaintain British officers for the Portuguese army, at an expense even so\r\ntrifling as it is, if the Portuguese government are to refuse to give\r\nthe service of the army in the cause of Europe in any manner. Pitch them\r\nto the devil, then, in the mode which will be most dignified to\r\nyourself, and that which will have the best effect in opening the\r\nprince's eyes to the conduct of his servants in Portugal; and let the\r\nmatter work its own way. Depend upon it, the British government must and\r\nwill recall the British officers.\r\n\r\n_August 7, 1815._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECHES IN PARLIAMENT.\r\n\r\n_Praise of Lord Hastings and the Indian Army._\r\n\r\nHe professed his entire concurrence in the tribute of approbation\r\nbestowed on the Marquis of Hastings, for his conduct of the late war in\r\nIndia. There could not remain a doubt in the minds of those acquainted\r\nwith the facts, but that the wisdom of the plan on which it was\r\ncommenced, and the vigour of its execution, merited the highest praise.\r\nThe noble Duke said, he was pleased that an opportunity, like the\r\npresent, had occurred to do justice to the services and gallantry of our\r\ntroops in India, which were often neglected or disallowed. No troops in\r\nthe world performed their duty better, or observed a more steady\r\ndiscipline. They had evinced their good qualities in all their late\r\ntransactions, whether acting in great masses or small detachments. In\r\nall situations they had nobly performed their duty.\r\n\r\n_House of Lords, March 9, 1819._\r\n\r\n_Impossibility of granting Catholic Emancipation._\r\n\r\nThe whole question turned upon the degree of security which could be\r\ngiven to the Protestant religion as by law established in Ireland. To\r\nconsider this, it was necessary to consider how the reformation had been\r\nestablished in Ireland. It was not necessary for him to recall to their\r\nlordships remembrance that the unreformed religion had been established\r\nin Ireland at the point of the sword, and by means of confiscations. All\r\nthis was repeated at the revolution, and was fresh in the recollection\r\nof the people of Ireland. Keeping in view that the Irish Roman Catholic\r\nchurch, under all oppressions, continued in the same state--the pope\r\nhaving the same influence over the clergy, the clergy the same power\r\nover the people; in this state of things, he would ask, whether it was\r\npossible that Roman Catholics could be safely admitted to hold seats in\r\nparliament? The influence of the priesthood over the people was fostered\r\nby the remembrance of the events to which he had alluded; and the idea\r\nof unmerited and mutual suffering; and no doubt could be entertained,\r\nfrom their present feelings, that if the Roman Catholics were admitted\r\nto the enjoyment of political power, their first exertion would be to\r\nrestore their religion to its original supremacy; and to recover the\r\npossessions and property of which they had been stripped by the\r\nreformation. It was, however, said, that securities were offered on the\r\npart of the Roman Catholics.\r\n\r\nThe pope, it seemed, had in the appointment of bishops, relinquished all\r\nto the crown, except the mere conferring of a spiritual blessing. But\r\nhow had that concession been received by the people of Ireland? It had\r\nexcited the utmost discontent, and was regarded as an abandonment of the\r\nessential principles of their religion, and an attack on their national\r\nindependence. Did that arise from the people of Ireland having a less\r\nclear idea of national independence than other people? No; but they felt\r\nif the executive power possessed any control over the appointment of the\r\nRoman Catholic bishops, some security would be thereby obtained for the\r\nProtestant church. Considering, then, that the whole question turned on\r\nthe degree of security which could be given, and looking at the various\r\nsecurities which had at several times been proposed, he had never yet\r\nseen anything that came up to his notion of that which ought to be\r\nrequired. As to what had been said of the domestic nomination of\r\nbishops, he did not see how the laws of the country could operate upon\r\nit, so as to make it an adequate security. Then as to the oath of\r\nallegiance which the bishop was to take, of what avail could it be, that\r\nthe law required this oath from a bishop, appointed God knows how, or by\r\nwhom? When all these circumstances were considered, the state of the\r\nIrish Catholic church, the way in which the reformation had been\r\neffected, the rivalry and enmity between the Catholics and the\r\nestablished church, and the inadequacy of all securities which had been\r\nproposed, there was in his opinion, enough to decide the question; for,\r\nthe first and greatest duty of the legislature was, to secure the\r\nestablishments as settled at the revolution.\r\n\r\n_House of Lords, May 17, 1819._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCounty meetings if properly regulated, are a fair constitutional mode of\r\ntaking the sense of the county; but this cannot be the case if they are\r\nattended by a mob for the express purpose of supporting one side.\r\n\r\n_House of Lords, January 26, 1821._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The Porte our ancient Ally._\r\n\r\nThe Ottoman Porte is the ancient ally of this country. It forms an\r\nessential part of the balance of power in Europe. The preservation of\r\nthe Ottoman Porte has been an object of importance not merely to England\r\nbut also to the whole of Europe; and the changes of possession which\r\nhave taken place in the east of Europe within the recollection of all\r\nwho hear me, render its existence as an independent and powerful state,\r\nnecessary to the well being of this country.\r\n\r\nIn the late war, had it not been for the influence of the councils of\r\nEngland over the Porte, I may safely say that the disaster which finally\r\nled to the establishment of Europe as it now is, would not have occurred\r\nto the extent it did in 1812. Under these circumstances I think we may\r\nterm the Ottoman Porte the \"ancient ally\" and friend of this country,\r\neven though the treaties upon which our alliance is founded are not of a\r\nhundred years standing.\r\n\r\n_House of Lords, Jan. 29, 1828._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Battle of Navarino an untoward Event. Sir E. Codrington acquitted of\r\nall blame._\r\n\r\nThere is one other subject to which I shall address myself, I mean the\r\nsense in which the word \"untoward\" has been used. It was intended by\r\n\"untoward\" to convey, that the event referred to was unexpected--was\r\nunfortunate. The sense in which the word was used was this: in the\r\ntreaty which is not yet before the house, and which cannot, therefore,\r\nregularly come under discussion, though all of us have read it, it is\r\nmentioned as one stipulation, that the execution of it, if possible,\r\nshall not lead to hostilities; and therefore, when the execution of it\r\ndid lead to hostilities, it was a consequence which the government did\r\nnot anticipate, and which it has, therefore, a right to call untoward.\r\n\r\nIt was hoped by the former government, that the treaty could be executed\r\nwithout risk of commencing hostilities; and that is rendered quite\r\nindisputable, not merely by the treaty, but by the force which the\r\ncontracting parties sent into the Mediterranean to superintend its\r\noperation.\r\n\r\nThe late administration entertained hopes that those treaties could be\r\ncarried into execution without hostilities, as your lordships must have\r\nperceived from what you have seen of those treaties themselves, as well\r\nas from the nature of the force sent to see them carried into execution;\r\nand when it was ultimately found that hostilities were likely to ensue,\r\nevery one must look upon it as an untoward event which could give rise\r\nto such a state of things.\r\n\r\nWhen the news of the affair which took place at Navarino reached\r\nConstantinople, it was apprehended that a war would ensue, and therefore\r\nevery one was justified in looking upon it as an untoward event.\r\n\r\nIt is gratifying, however, to find from his majesty's speech, that those\r\nappearances of hostility have ceased to exist, and that hopes are\r\nentertained that no impediment will present itself to an amicable\r\nadjustment of the question; this, however, does not deprive the\r\ntransaction of the character of \"untowardness\" which it originally\r\npossessed.\r\n\r\nBut in making this statement, do I make the slightest charge, do I cast\r\nthe most distant imputation upon the gallant officer who commanded at\r\nNavarino? Certainly not. That gallant officer, in doing as he has done,\r\ndischarged what he felt to be his duty to his country. His majesty's\r\ngovernment have taken that gallant officer's conduct into consideration,\r\nand have acquitted him of all blame; and, therefore, it would ill\r\nbecome me to cast the slightest imputation on the distinguished action\r\nhe performed. It should be recollected, that the gallant admiral was\r\nplaced in a situation of great delicacy as well as difficulty. He was\r\nplaced in the command of a combined squadron, in conjunction with two\r\nforeign admirals; and his conduct was such, that they placed the most\r\nimplicit confidence in him, and allowed him to lead them to victory. My\r\nlords, I should feel myself unworthy of the situation which I hold in\r\nhis majesty's councils, if I thought myself capable of uttering a single\r\nsyllable against that gallant admiral, admiring, as I do, the intrepid\r\nbravery with which he conducted himself in a moment of much danger and\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\n_House of Lords, January 29, 1828._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Reason for being Prime Minister._\r\n\r\nWhen I received his majesty's commands to give my opinion respecting the\r\nformation of a ministry, it was far from my wish to place myself at its\r\nhead, or to take any office, other than that which I already held; but\r\nfinding, in the course of the negotiation which arose out of the\r\ncommands of his majesty, a difficulty in getting another individual to\r\nfill the place, and that it was the unanimous wish of those who are now\r\nmy colleagues, that I should take it, I determined to accept it; but\r\nhaving so determined, I resigned the office of commander-in-chief.\r\n\r\n_House of Lords, January 29, 1828._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The Doctrine of Non-interference._\r\n\r\nMuch has been said here and elsewhere, at various times, on the question\r\nof interference by one state in the affairs of another. I do not admit\r\nthe right of one country to interfere with the internal affairs of\r\nanother country, except where the law of necessity or great political\r\ninterests may render interference absolutely necessary. But I say that\r\nnon-interference is the rule, and interference the exception. This is\r\nthe ground of the policy on which this country acts. She disdains a\r\ndaily interference with the affairs of other countries.\r\n\r\n_House of Lords, February 11, 1828._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_No Personal or Political Hostility to Canning._\r\n\r\nI rise to protest against any such imputation being cast upon me, as\r\nthat I ever entertained any personal hostility to Mr. Canning. On a\r\nformer occasion I stated distinctly to your lordships, why I did not\r\nthink proper to remain in the government of which Mr. Canning was the\r\nhead. The communications that passed between me and Mr. Canning have,\r\nunfortunately, I must be allowed to say, been made public enough, and I\r\ndefy any man to point out anything like personal feelings in those\r\ncommunications. It is true, that when I found it necessary to withdraw\r\nfrom the government, I also thought it my duty to lay down the military\r\noffice which I hold; but I beg leave to call your lordships'\r\nrecollection to the explanation which I gave at that time, and to my\r\nsubsequent conduct. After I left the government, I always met Mr.\r\nCanning in the way in which I had been accustomed to meet him, and did\r\nnot depart from those habits which had marked our previous intercourse.\r\nBut I will go further and say, that I had no hostility towards Mr.\r\nCanning's government. I did, it is true, propose that a clause should be\r\nadded to the corn-bill, but did I not at the same time beg of the\r\ngovernment to adopt that clause, or something like it, and not to\r\nabandon the bill? I must again repeat, that to the day of his death I\r\nfelt no personal hostility to Mr. Canning; and that I am equally free\r\nfrom the imputation of having entertained any political hostility\r\ntowards him. To whatever persons the declaration of the right honourable\r\ngentleman (Mr. Huskisson) was intended to apply.[9] I claim to myself\r\nthe right of not being included in the number of Mr. Canning's enemies.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: Referring to an angry speech of that gentleman in the\r\nCommons.]\r\n\r\n_House of Lords, February 25, 1828._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Corn Law of 1828, Principle on which founded._\r\n\r\nYour lordships are all aware that a variety of opinions exist throughout\r\nthe country respecting the introduction of foreign corn; one class of\r\npersons maintaining that its importation should be prohibited; while\r\nothers contend for its free introduction into the markets of the\r\ncountry. I have considered it my duty, and my colleagues also have\r\nconsidered it theirs, in the measure which they are about to propose to\r\nparliament, to endeavour to steer their course between the two extremes,\r\nand to propose a measure which shall have the effect of conciliating all\r\nparties, be at the same time favourable to the public, and shall be\r\npermanent. Your lordships will recollect, notwithstanding the difference\r\nof opinion which exists on this subject, all parties agree, generally,\r\nthat the corn growers of this country ought, in some measure, to be\r\nprotected.\r\n\r\nThe number of individuals, either in parliament or out of it, who\r\nmaintain that foreign corn should be altogether free of duty, are very\r\nfew indeed. Some persons, undoubtedly, think that a small fixed duty\r\nought to be imposed; and I, my lords, should certainly say here, that if\r\nany such fixed duty were imposed, it ought to be a very small one; but I\r\nrepeat, that whatever may be the particular doctrines or opinions of one\r\nclass of persons or another, all agree that some protection ought to be\r\nafforded to the agriculture of this country. This opinion is founded on\r\nthe great burden of taxation upon the country generally, as well as on\r\nthe particular burdens on the land; and on the fact that the labouring\r\nclasses here are better fed, clothed, and lodged, than the people of the\r\nsame class in other countries. It is admitted by those who entertain\r\nthis opinion in favour of a low duty, that their expectation and\r\nintention are, that the poorer lands of this country, which have been\r\nbrought into cultivation by the application of great labour, and by the\r\nexpenditure of large capital, should at once be thrown out of\r\ncultivation; and even the richer lands would become, comparatively,\r\nunprofitable in consequence of the adoption of their system. I will\r\nmaintain that this country has been brought to its present high state of\r\ncultivation, and consequent internal wealth, by the fostering protection\r\nwhich has invariably been given to agriculture, and which has induced\r\ngentlemen to lay out their capital in redeeming waste lands and bringing\r\nthem into cultivation. The result of such a system would be--to throw\r\nout of cultivation the land thus redeemed from waste; to reduce the\r\nextent of cultivation of the richer lands, consequently to lessen the\r\nproductive power of the country; and finally to throw us for subsistence\r\nand support on the resources of foreign nations. My lords,--I will not\r\nexaggerate the effects likely to be produced by the pursuing of a system\r\nsuch as that to which I have alluded; but I beg your lordships to\r\nreflect on the consequences which must result, if the powers, from whose\r\ndominions these resources are generally drawn, should think proper to\r\nlay a heavy tax on the export of such corn, or that it should be subject\r\nto such an operation by any other state, in its transit to this country.\r\nI entreat your lordships to consider what must be the consequences of\r\nsuch a measure in its results to this country; a measure, too, in which\r\nI may say, that foreign states might, from circumstances, be highly\r\njustified. But supposing such moderation on the part of those states,\r\nthat they should continue to allow us to draw our supplies from their\r\ndominions; supposing we could be supplied from other countries--America,\r\nfor instance; yet I entreat your lordships to observe, that this\r\ncountry would be constantly, under the proposed system of fixed duty,\r\nplaced in the state in which it found itself in years of famine and\r\nscarcity, which occurred in both the last and present century, and would\r\nof consequence be exposed to the highest possible prices for wheat.\r\nThis, my Lords, I say, would be the inevitable consequence.\r\n\r\nThe cost of production, in Poland, for instance, would not be increased;\r\nbut the prices would be regulated here, not by the prices of that\r\ncountry, but by the scarcity price of this country, and by the profits\r\nof all those who might be, directly or indirectly, concerned in the\r\ncontemplated importation of corn, in such a state of things as that to\r\nwhich I have alluded. Under these circumstances, a low duty would not be\r\nproductive of a reduction in price; indeed, so far from diminution, I am\r\nconfident it would produce an enormous increase. But, my Lords, I would\r\nask, even supposing it were otherwise, whether it would be proper to\r\nadopt such a measure, in reference to its probable effect in other\r\nrespects? My Lords, look to Ireland, and consider what must by the\r\ninevitable consequence if agriculture is not to be encouraged in that\r\ncountry--a country, which, during the last year supplied England with\r\nmore than 2,000,000 quarters of grain. The quantity of wheat alone\r\nimported from Ireland last year, was no less than 400,000 quarters. I do\r\ntherefore, beg your Lordships to consider what must be the consequence\r\nof cutting off from that country nearly the only source of industry--the\r\nonly manufacture, with one exception, which is established in that\r\ncountry. No man, whether connected with that country or not, can for a\r\nmoment think of imposing such a sacrifice on that country. On the\r\ncontrary, I am disposed to think, that many of your Lordships will be\r\nready to make considerable sacrifices to procure for the people of\r\nIreland a share of that plenty their industry affords us. But, my Lords,\r\nI speak not only with reference to Ireland, but with reference to this\r\ncountry. I am ready to state that the gentlemen of this country have, by\r\nthe extent of their capital, and the labour which they have employed on\r\ntheir estates, raised the agriculture of this kingdom to its present\r\nprosperous condition; and nothing would be more unjust than to take from\r\nthem that protection by which they have been enabled to bring\r\ncultivation to the state in which it now is, and to deprive them of\r\nthose profits which are so justly their due, on account of the capital\r\nlaid out by them.\r\n\r\nI will say, that the merchant, that the manufacturer, the poor, and the\r\nwhole public, are interested in the maintenance of the independent\r\naffluence of the nobility and gentry of this country,--that the\r\nGovernment are interested in supporting their influence, on account of\r\nthe assistance which has always been derived from them in every branch\r\nof internal government, and on account of the support which they have\r\nafforded to Government under every circumstance. If it were in my power\r\nto make corn cheaper by diminishing the protection which the landed\r\ngentry have always received, I would not do it at the expense of\r\nIreland, and of all the evils which the measure must inflict upon the\r\nessential interests of this country.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, having expressed my opinion upon the system of importation at\r\na low duty, I will now offer a few observations with respect to the\r\nother system,--that of entire prohibition; and which, I must say, has\r\nbeen greatly and justly complained of. The truth is, that such a system\r\ncould not be carried into execution without exposing the country to the\r\ngreatest possible evils:--first of all, from want--next from high\r\nprices, and also from a superabundance of corn, arising from the\r\nintroduction of a greater quantity of wheat than required being in the\r\ncountry at a period when the scarcity might have been relieved by an\r\nabundant harvest; and, lastly, from the depression of prices, affecting\r\nnot only the producers of corn in this country, but also the importers\r\nof foreign grain. My Lords, evils like these can only be relieved by the\r\nillegal interference of the Government, or by ministers coming to\r\nParliament, in order to induce it to consent to a suspension of the law.\r\n\r\nSuch, my Lords, is the history of the corn question as regards\r\nprohibition; and there is not the least doubt that the system has\r\nproduced all the evils to which I have alluded at one period or another.\r\n\r\n_March 31, 1828._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Reason for repealing the Test and Corporation Acts._\r\n\r\nI fully agree that the security of the Church of England, and the union\r\nexisting between it and the state, depend neither on the law about to be\r\nrepealed by the present bill, nor upon the provisions of this measure\r\nitself. That union and security, which we must all desire to see\r\ncontinued, depend upon the oath taken by his Majesty, to which we are\r\nall, in our respective stations, parties, and not only on that oath, but\r\non the Act of Settlement, and the different acts of union from time to\r\ntime agreed to; all of which provide for the intimate and inseparable\r\nunion of church and state, and for the security of both.\r\n\r\nThe question is, what security does the existing system of laws, as they\r\nnow stand, afford the church establishment? My lords, I am very dubious\r\nas to the amount of security afforded through the means of a system of\r\nexclusion from office, to be carried into effect by a law which it is\r\nnecessary to suspend by an annual act, that admits every man into office\r\nwhom it was the intention of the original framers of the law to exclude.\r\nIt is perfectly true it was not the intention of those who brought in\r\nthat suspension law originally, that dissenters from the church of\r\nEngland should be permitted to enter into corporations under its\r\nprovisions. The law was intended to relieve those whom time or\r\ncircumstances had rendered unable to qualify themselves according to the\r\nsystem which government had devised. However, the dissenters availed\r\nthemselves of the relaxation of the law, for the purpose of getting into\r\ncorporations, and this the law allowed. What security, then, I ask, my\r\nLords, is to be found in the existing system? So far from dissenters\r\nbeing excluded by the corporation and test acts, from all corporations,\r\nso far is this from being the fact, that, as must be well known to your\r\nLordships, some corporations are absolutely and entirely in the\r\npossession of dissenters. Can you suppose that the repeal of laws so\r\ninoperative as these, can afford any serious obstacle to the perfect\r\nsecurity of the church, and the permanent union of that establishment\r\nwith the state? The fact is, that the existing laws have not only failed\r\ncompletely in answering their intended purpose, but they are anomalous\r\nand absurd--anomalous in their origin, absurd in their operation.\r\n\r\nIf a man were asked the question, at his elevation to any corporate\r\noffice, whether he had received the sacrament of the church of England,\r\nand if he said \"No,\" he lost every vote that had been tendered on his\r\nbehalf, and there was an end of his election, but if, on the contrary,\r\nby accident or design, he got in without the question relative to the\r\nsacrament being put to him, then the votes tendered for him were held\r\ngood, and his election valid; so that no power could remove him from the\r\noffice which he held. I ask, is there any security in that? My noble\r\nfriend says, that the original intention of the framers of these acts,\r\nwas that the sacrament should not be taken by dissenters; but the law\r\nrequires that a man, on entering into any corporation, shall receive the\r\nsacrament, without regard to his religious belief. Thus an individual\r\nwhose object it is to get into a particular office, may feel disposed,\r\nnaturally enough, to take the sacrament before his election, merely as a\r\nmatter of form, and thus a sacred rite of our church is profaned, and\r\nprostituted to a shameful and scandalous purpose. I confess my Lords, I\r\nshould have opposed this bill, if I thought it calculated to weaken the\r\nsecurities at present enjoyed by the church. However, I agreed not to\r\noppose the bill; though I consented in the first instance to oppose it,\r\nin order to preserve the blessings of religious peace. I was willing to\r\npreserve the system which had given us this peace for forty years, for\r\nduring that time the name and the claims of the dissenters not been\r\nheard of. But now they have come forward, and their claims are approved\r\nof by a great majority of the House of Commons, and the bill has come up\r\nto this house. If it be opposed by the majority of this house, it is to\r\nbe feared, now that the claims are made, that such an opposition will\r\ncarry hostility throughout the country, and introduce a degree of\r\nrancour into every parish of the kingdom, which I should not wish to be\r\nresponsible for.\r\n\r\n_April 17, 1828._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Additional reasons for repealing the Test Act._\r\n\r\nI have not called on your lordships to agree to this bill because it has\r\nbeen passed by the House of Commons; I merely assigned that as one of\r\nthe reasons which induced me to recommend the measure to your Lordships.\r\nI certainly did allude to the feeling in favour of the bill which has\r\nfor some time been growing up in the House of Commons, as a good reason\r\nfor entertaining it in your Lordships' house,--but other reasons also\r\noperated on my mind. Many individuals of high eminence in the church and\r\nwho are as much interested as any other persons in the kingdom in the\r\npreservation of the Constitution, have expressed themselves as being\r\nfavourable to an alteration of the law. The religious feelings of those\r\nvenerable persons disposed them to entertain this measure, because they\r\nfelt strong objections to the sacramental test. Under these\r\ncircumstances, wishing to advance and preserve the blessings of\r\nreligious peace and tranquillity; conceiving the present a good\r\nopportunity for securing to the country so inestimable an advantage,--I\r\nfelt it to be my duty to recommend this measure to your Lordships. It is\r\non all these grounds that I support the bill, and not on the single\r\nground, the circumstance of its having been carried in the House of\r\nCommons, as a noble Lord has stated. I am not one of those who consider\r\nthat the best means of preserving the constitution of this country, is\r\nby rigidly adhering to measures which have been called for by particular\r\ncircumstances, because those measures have been in existence for two\r\nhundred years; for the lapse of time might render it proper to modify,\r\nif not to remove them altogether.\r\n\r\nI admit my Lords, that for about two hundred years, the religious peace\r\nof the country has been preserved under these bills; but, when\r\nParliament is discussing the best means of preserving the constitution\r\nof the country, it is surely worth while to inquire whether any and\r\nwhat changes, in what have been deemed the securities of the church, can\r\nsafely be made, so as to conciliate all parties.\r\n\r\nAll I hope is, that your Lordships will not unnecessarily make any\r\nalteration in the measure, that would be likely to give dissatisfaction;\r\nthat your Lordships will not do anything which may be calculated to\r\nremove that conciliating spirit which is now growing up,--a spirit that\r\nwill redound to the benefit of the country, and which, so far from\r\nopposing, we ought, on the contrary, to do everything to foster and\r\npromote.\r\n\r\n_April 21st 1828._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Emancipation.--Will oppose it, (April 1828,) unless he sees a great\r\nchange in the government_.\r\n\r\nThere is no person in this house, whose feelings and sentiments, after\r\nlong consideration, are more decided than mine are, with respect to the\r\nsubject of the Roman Catholic claims; and I must say, that until I see a\r\nvery great change in that question, I certainly shall continue to oppose\r\nit.\r\n\r\n_April 28th, 1828._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_State of the Poor in Ireland._\r\n\r\nI am thoroughly convinced that no part of his Majesty's dominions so\r\nimperiously requires the constant and particular attention of his\r\nMajesty's servants as Ireland does. A noble earl has stated that there\r\nare in Ireland 8,000,000 of people, the situation of 6,000,000 of whom\r\ndemands inquiry. He has told your Lordships likewise, that all the\r\nwealth of Ireland is not sufficient to give employment to those people.\r\nNow, certainly, I cannot but think that this is an exaggerated statement\r\non the part of the noble earl.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be supposed that there are 6,000,000 of the Irish population\r\nwho require employment--I cannot admit that the whole of those people\r\nare unemployed. It is not true that they suffer this distress at all\r\ntimes,--it is not true that they suffer the same degree of distress in\r\ndifferent years; but it is unquestionably true, that they do suffer\r\ngreat distress at various periods, owing to the casualties of the\r\nseasons, and to the particular species of food on which they subsist.\r\nSuch is the plain fact. The noble earl has stated, that the people are\r\nable to procure that sort of food on which they chiefly live, at the\r\nrate of three-farthings a stone. Now, really, if those people do not\r\nsuffer distress, except that which is occasioned by the untowardness of\r\nthe seasons; if those 6,000,000 of people can get provisions at the\r\nprice mentioned by the noble earl, in favourable seasons,--it does\r\nappear to me that the case hardly calls for inquiry, except at a time\r\nwhen their food has failed in consequence of an unproductive season. But\r\nthen the noble earl has asserted that the distress arises from want of\r\nwork, and that it would take more than all the wealth of Ireland to\r\nprocure employment for the people. \"Let us then,\" said the noble earl,\r\n\"relieve the sick, the lame, the aged, and the impotent.\" The noble earl\r\nhas said, that one of the great evils of Ireland is want of capital; but\r\nI must beg leave to tell the noble earl, that profusion of capital alone\r\nwill not prevent the existence of a numerous body of poor, and to prove\r\nthe fact let the noble earl look to the situation of England. There is\r\nno want of capital in this country; the noble earl has told your\r\nlordships that there are invested here £9,000,000 of capital belonging\r\nto Ireland alone; and yet, with all this capital, the support of the\r\npoor required last year amounted to no less than £7,000,000 of rates.\r\n\r\n_May 21st. 1828._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Catholic Emancipation._\r\n\r\nA noble friend of mine has stated to the house, that the proposed\r\nmeasure is inconsistent with the constitution, as established at the\r\nrevolution; and another noble lord has concurred in that statement. If I\r\nhad been going to propose a measure which would introduce a predominant\r\nCatholic power into Parliament, I should then be doing that which is\r\nclearly inconsistent with the constitution. But I am not going to do any\r\nsuch thing. There are degrees of power at least. Will any man venture to\r\nsay, that Catholic power does not exist at present, either here or in\r\nIreland? I will address myself more particularly to the noble Lords who\r\nhave so pointedly opposed me, and I will ask them whether Roman Catholic\r\npower was not introduced into Ireland by measures of their own? Did not\r\nsome noble lords exert their influence to the utmost to produce that\r\nvery power, which has rendered a measure like that which I have\r\nannounced to Parliament absolutely necessary? As such is the case, I\r\nimplore noble Lords to look at the situation of the country, and the\r\nstate of society which it has produced. Whether it has been brought\r\nabout by the existence of these disabilities, or by the Catholic\r\nAssociation, I will not pretend to say; but this I will say, that no man\r\nwho has looked at the state of things for the last two years, can\r\nproceed longer upon the old system, in the existing condition of\r\nIreland, and of mens' opinions on the subject, both in that country and\r\nin this. My opinion is, that it is the wish of the majority of the\r\npeople, that this question should be settled one way or other. It is\r\nupon that principle, and in conformity to that wish, that I and my\r\ncolleagues have undertaken to bring the adjustment of it under the\r\nconsideration of Parliament.\r\n\r\n_February 5, 1829._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Defence of his Conduct with respect to Emancipation._\r\n\r\nI have repeatedly declared my earnest wish to see the Roman Catholic\r\nquestion settled. I believe nothing could ever have been more distinct\r\nor explicit than my expression of that wish; and is it a matter of\r\nsurprise that the person entertaining it should avail himself of the\r\nfirst opportunity of proposing the adoption of that which, over and over\r\nagain, he declared himself anxiously to wish? On this particular\r\nquestion I had long ago made up my mind, as a member of this house, to\r\ntake a particular course. It may be thought peculiar as a matter of\r\ntaste; but, for many years, I have acted upon the determination never to\r\nvote for the affirmation of this question until the Government, acting\r\nas a Government, should propose it to the legislature. My noble relation\r\n(Lord Longford) knows, that ever since the year 1810, the several\r\nsuccessive Governments of this country have been formed upon a principle\r\nwhich prevented their ever proposing, as a Government, the adoption of\r\nany measure of relief in regard to the Catholics. In order to the\r\nformation of a cabinet which, acting as a Government, could propose this\r\nmeasure, it was, in the first place, necessary to obtain the consent of\r\nthat individual, the most interested by his station, his duty, and the\r\nmost sacred of all obligations, of any individual in the empire. It was\r\nnecessary, I say, that I should obtain the consent of that individual,\r\nbefore the members of the Government could consider the question as a\r\nGovernment one. Now, under such circumstances as these, would it have\r\nbeen proper in me to have breathed a syllable on the subject, until I\r\nhad obtained the consent of the illustrious personage to whom I have\r\nalluded?[10] I call upon my noble relative to answer this question, if\r\nhe can, in the negative. I beg of my noble relative to ask himself this\r\nquestion, whether I was wrong in having kept secret my views, since the\r\nmonth of July or August, not talking to any man upon the subject, until\r\nI had the consent of that exalted personage, to form a Government upon\r\nthe principle of taking the question to which I have alluded into\r\nconsideration? My noble relative ought to place himself in my\r\nsituation--he ought to see what was expected of me; and then, instead of\r\nblaming me for acting as I have done, he would see that, if I had acted\r\notherwise, I should have been highly blameable. When the question had\r\nbeen decided--when I received the permission, so as to be enabled to\r\nmake the declaration--on not having made which, alone the accusation of\r\nsurprise can be founded--the opening of the session was so near, that it\r\nwas impossible to make known what had occurred earlier, or in any other\r\nmanner than by the speech from the Throne.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: Lord Longford had accused him of concealment.]\r\n\r\n_February 10, 1829._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The Emancipation Bill not the result of Fear._\r\n\r\nHe would positively reject the charge which had been so positively made,\r\nthat those measures had been suggested to his Majesty's ministers, or\r\nthat their minds had been at all influenced by the fear of anything that\r\nwould occur in this or any other country. He totally denied the truth of\r\nsuch an assertion. There never was a period during the last twenty years\r\nin which, looking to the circumstances and relations of this country,\r\nthere was a more total absence of all cause for fear than the present;\r\nand whatever might be the consequences of this measure, he would\r\nmaintain, that the period at which it was introduced, showed\r\nsufficiently that its introduction did not proceed from fear; and that\r\nsuch was the fact, he was ready to prove to any man upon the clearest\r\npossible evidence. But, though these measures had not been suggested by\r\nfear nor by intimidation, it would be found, when they were brought\r\nforward, that they were founded upon the clear and decided opinion, that\r\nthis question ought to be settled, and that considerable sacrifices had\r\nbeen made by himself and his colleagues in this, and in the other House\r\nof Parliament, with a view to the final adjustment of it. In doing so,\r\nhe begged the noble Lord on the cross bench to believe, that not the\r\nleast considerable or the least disagreeable sacrifice on his part, was\r\nthe necessity imposed on him of differing from the noble lord on this\r\nsubject. But he would not talk of his own sacrifices--they were\r\ntrifling, when compared with the sacrifices which had been made by some\r\nof his noble friends near him, and by his right honourable friend in\r\nanother place. He could not conceive a greater sacrifice than must have\r\nbeen made by his right honourable friend, to bring his mind to the\r\ndetermination of carrying this measure. It was obvious that nothing but\r\nan imperious sense of duty had induced his right honourable friend to\r\nmake such a sacrifice; but the inconveniences and dangers which had\r\narisen from the present state of things in this country and in Ireland,\r\nhad left no alternative but the adoption of this measure; and now that\r\nhe had adopted it, he would use his best endeavours, in concert with his\r\ncolleagues, to carry it into effect. Under such circumstances, he would\r\nentreat their lordships to wait until the whole question should have\r\ncome before them. When the measure should have been well considered by\r\nthem, they would then see whether it would be attended with the\r\ndangerous consequences ascribed to it--and whether the carrying it would\r\nnot place the Protestant Constitution of these realms upon a better\r\nfooting than it had been since the union with Ireland. He would not now\r\nenter into the discussion, whether the consequences of this measure\r\nwould be injurious to that Throne, for the maintenance of which he was\r\nready to sacrifice his life, or whether the measure was likely to\r\nproduce those effects which were apprehended by his noble friend on the\r\ncross bench. Of this he was certain, that the existence of the dangers\r\nwhich some noble lords seemed to apprehend from the adjustment of this\r\nquestion, they were never able to establish; and whenever the discussion\r\nof the measure came before their lordships, he would be ready to prove,\r\nthat the Protestant institutions of this country were exposed to more\r\ndangers at present, than they would be exposed to after the adoption of\r\nthe measure that would be proposed.\r\n\r\n_February 16, 1829._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Former Associations in Ireland could not be put down.--Mr. Pitt for\r\nEmancipation._\r\n\r\nHe must say, he apprehended from the number of persons in the habit of\r\nattending that Association, the nature of the speeches there delivered,\r\nand the measures to which all alike appeared parties, that the people\r\nof Ireland at large had been parties to the Association.\r\n\r\nHe proposed the present bill as a preliminary measure; the necessity for\r\nwhich was founded on the statements already made to their Lordships. He\r\nconsidered any other mode of proceeding as inconsistent with the dignity\r\nof the Crown, and of Parliament; and as absolutely necessary, in order\r\nto reconcile to the ulterior measure which he intended to propose, the\r\ngood and worthy men in this country, who viewed with dismay and disgust\r\nthe violent and unconstitutional acts of the Association. He entreated\r\ntheir Lordships to consider, that the eyes of all Europe were upon them;\r\nand that they should do nothing which could give any man ground to\r\nbelieve that, in the steps they were about to take, they were guided by\r\nany other motive than that of expediency and good policy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf they looked to the state in which the Roman Catholic question stood\r\nin Parliament, from the period of the Union down to the present, they\r\nwould see the prevalence of a growing opinion in its favour. Mr. Pitt\r\nhad, in his time, considered it necessary to admit, that the laws\r\nenforcing eligibility upon Catholics ought to be reviewed, for the\r\npurposes of modification; and, under the repeated assurances of\r\ndifferent eminent statesmen, a Roman Catholic influence had undoubtedly\r\ngrown up in Ireland, which it was high time to satisfy by a reasonable\r\nchange of policy. For some years after this subject had attracted\r\nparliamentary attention, there were reasons of a highly creditable\r\nnature, both to individual ministers and to Parliament, why it would\r\nhave been improper and impolitic to have brought the measure forward as\r\na measure of government; but, since the year 1811, these particular\r\nreasons had not been in full operation; and the subject, notwithstanding\r\nthe divided state of the Cabinet upon it, had been constantly discussed,\r\nand during all that time, had been gaining ground. He was not prepared\r\nto describe here the mode in which the principle of a divided government\r\nhad operated upon the Catholic question; but he defied any member of the\r\ngovernment, at the period to which he referred, to deny that, whether\r\nthe question before them was one of education for Ireland, one for the\r\nalteration of the Criminal Law, or one for the regulation of tithes,\r\nthis division was felt to affect one and all of these topics; in fact,\r\nthat none of them could come to be discussed, without some reference to\r\nthe great subject which was so long in agitation. The time had, he\r\nhoped, now arrived, when Parliament was prepared to settle it.\r\n\r\n_February 19, 1829._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_Unparalleled State of Ireland in 1829._\r\n\r\nFrom all he had seen and read relative to Ireland, during the last two\r\nyears, he was forced to arrive at this conclusion, namely, that he did\r\nnot believe there was on the face of the globe any country claiming the\r\ndenomination of a civilized country, situated as that country now was,\r\nunder the Government of his Majesty and the Imperial Parliament.\r\n\r\n_February 19, 1829._\r\n\r\n_The Roman Catholic Association dangerous._\r\n\r\nThe true description of this Association was, in his opinion, to be\r\nfound stated in the speech which had been delivered from the Throne, on\r\nthe first day of the session. In that speech, after observing that the\r\nstate of Ireland had been \"the object of his Majesty's continued\r\nsolicitude,\" it was further observed, \"his Majesty laments that in that\r\npart of the United Kingdom, an association should still exist which is\r\ndangerous to the public peace, and inconsistent with the spirit of the\r\nConstitution--- which keeps alive disorder and ill-will amongst his\r\nMajesty's subjects, and which must, if permitted to continue,\r\neffectually obstruct every effort permanently to improve the condition\r\nof Ireland.\" The speech proceeded to say--\"His Majesty confidently\r\nrelies on the wisdom and on the support of his Parliament; and his\r\nMajesty feels assured, that you will commit to him such powers as may\r\nenable his Majesty to maintain his just authority.\" Such was a just\r\ndescription of the recent state of the Roman Catholic Association; but\r\nhe believed he was justified in stating, that in the original\r\ninstitution and formation of the society, on the subject of which it was\r\nhis duty to address their lordships, there was nothing strictly illegal.\r\nThe illegality subsequently complained of, and which it was the object\r\nof this, as well as of a former bill, to suppress, proceeded from its\r\nacts. Those acts consisted principally in levying a tax upon certain of\r\nhis Majesty's subjects, called Catholic Rent; and this, by means and\r\nacts of extreme violence, which occasioned constant heart-burnings and\r\njealousies amongst his Majesty's subjects--by appointing persons to\r\ncollect the rent--by appointing other individuals to be treasurers of\r\nit; farther, by adopting measures for organising the Catholic\r\npopulation--by appointing persons to superintend that organisation--and\r\nby assuming to themselves the government of the country, and still more,\r\naffecting to assume it. Besides, they expended this rent in a manner\r\ncontrary to, and utterly inconsistent with, all law and order, and the\r\nConstitution of the country. But this was not the least material part of\r\nthe danger occasioned by the Catholic Association. Part of the money\r\nthus improperly obtained was spent for election purposes. And here he\r\ncalled the attention of the noble and learned lord, to acts proving the\r\nexistence in Parliament of a Roman Catholic influence, and of an\r\ninfluence directly derived from this Association. He would not discuss\r\nthat subject further at the present moment; but he begged noble lords\r\nnot to forget it, in discussing the details of a measure which he should\r\nhave to propose hereafter for their Lordships' adoption. Besides the\r\nmoney spent in elections, there were other sums (also arising out of the\r\nrent) spent in endeavours to contravene the due administration of\r\njustice in Ireland. When he made this observation, he fully and freely\r\nadmitted the right, and, indeed, duty of every man, to watch closely and\r\nvigilantly the administration of law and justice in this country; but,\r\nat the same time, he was prepared to maintain, that that right and duty\r\ncould not be conveniently and justly exercised by the members of a\r\nself-elected Association, having large sums at their command, and\r\nemploying the money which they possessed for the purpose of exciting a\r\nspirit of litigation and dissatisfaction among his Majesty's\r\nsubjects--employing it for the purpose of defending some\r\nindividuals--for the purpose of prosecuting others--- for the purpose of\r\nprejudicing the first inquiries in cases of criminal procedure, and\r\nunduly interfering with the administration of justice by the magistracy.\r\n\r\n_February 10, 1829._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe people were insidiously led to believe that the proposed measures\r\nwere for the establishment of popery, and the destruction of the\r\nprotestant establishment of the country; and, acting very properly on\r\nthis unfounded delusion, petitioned against them. But while he admired\r\nand rejoiced in the excellent motives which induced the people of this\r\ncountry, in many places, to protest against the intended measures of\r\ngovernment; he hoped that when they saw that those measures were not of\r\nthe dangerous nature ascribed to them, and that they tended, so far from\r\nestablishing popery, to check and prevent its growth, and to promote the\r\ninfluence of the protestant religion in Ireland,--he hoped, he said,\r\nthe people of England would, in their conduct, evince that loyalty to\r\nthe crown, whence the recommendation of the measure had emanated, and\r\nthat confidence in the wisdom of parliament, which had ever honourably\r\ndistinguished them. Indeed, he was convinced, that when the people of\r\nEngland saw there was no fear of the extension of popery from the\r\nmeasure which ministers felt it to be their duty to recommend to their\r\nsovereign, but that, on the contrary, they would tend to strengthen the\r\nprotestant interests of the state, they would hail those measures as\r\nbeneficial to all classes.[11]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: This, and the foregoing extracts on the subject of\r\nCatholic Emancipation, are from short speeches made by the Duke in the\r\nHouse of Lords after the intentions of the government had been made\r\nknown, but before the Emancipation Bill came up to that house. Although\r\nthe Duke earnestly deprecated these preliminary discussions, he was\r\ncalled up almost every night by some peer or other.]\r\n\r\n_March 2, 1829._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_No Compact with Rome would add to the security of the church of\r\nIreland._\r\n\r\nI know that there are many in this house, and many in this country, who\r\nthink--and I am free to admit that I was formerly of the same opinion\r\nmyself--that the state ought to have some security for the church\r\nagainst the proceedings of the Roman Catholic clergy, besides the oaths\r\nimposed on them by the Act of Parliament I confess that on examining\r\ninto the question, and upon looking more minutely than I had before\r\nleisure to do, at the various acts of Parliament by which the church of\r\nEngland is constituted, and which form the foundation on which it rests,\r\nI can think of no sort of arrangement capable of being carried into\r\nexecution in this country which can add to the security of the\r\nestablished church. I beg your Lordships to attend for a moment whilst I\r\nexplain the situation of the kingdom of Prussia with respect to the\r\nRoman Catholic religion. The King of Prussia exercises the power which\r\nhe does over the Roman Catholic church, in her various dominions, under\r\ndifferent concordats made with the Pope: in Silesia, under a concordat\r\nmade by Buonaparte with the Pope; and in the territories on the right\r\nbank of the Rhine, under the concordat made by the former sovereigns of\r\nthose countries with the Pope. Each of these concordats supposes that\r\nthe Pope possesses some power in the country, which he is enabled to\r\nconcede to the sovereign with whom the concordat is made. That is a\r\npoint which we can never yield to any sovereign whatever. There is no\r\nsovereign, be he who he may, who has any power in this country to confer\r\nupon his majesty. We must keep our sovereign clear from such\r\ntransactions. We can, therefore, have no security of that\r\ndescription,--not even a veto, on the appointment of a Roman Catholic\r\nbishop, without detracting, in some degree, from the authority and\r\ndignity of the sovereign, and without admitting that the Pope has\r\nsomething to concede to his Majesty.\r\n\r\nNow let us suppose another security. Suppose it were arranged that his\r\nMajesty should have the nomination of the Catholic bishops. If he\r\nnominated them, he must also give them a jurisdiction--he must give them\r\na diocese. I should like to know in what part of Ireland or England the\r\nking could fix upon a spot where he could, consistently with the oath he\r\nhas taken, nominate a Catholic bishop, or give him a diocese? The king\r\nis sworn to maintain the rights and privileges of the bishops, and of\r\nthe clergy of this realm, and of the churches committed to their charge.\r\nNow, consistently with that oath, how could the king appoint a bishop of\r\nthe Roman Catholic religion; and would not the Established church lose\r\nmore than it gained by the assumption of such a power on the part of his\r\nMajesty? Then, my Lords, there is another security, which some noble\r\nLords think it desirable to have,--namely, the obtaining, by government,\r\nof copies of all correspondence between the Catholic clergy and the\r\nCourt of Rome; and the supervising of that correspondence, in order to\r\nprevent any danger resulting to the Established church. Upon that point\r\nI must say I feel the greatest objection to involve the government of\r\nthis country in such matters. That correspondence, we are told, turns on\r\nspiritual affairs. But I will suppose for the sake of argument, that it\r\nturns on questions of excommunication. Is it, then, to be suffered, that\r\nthe Pope, and his Majesty, or his Majesty's secretary of state acting\r\nfor him, should make law for this country? for that would be the result\r\nof communications between the Catholic clergy of this realm and the Pope\r\nbeing submitted to his Majesty's inspection, or to the inspection of\r\nhis Majesty's secretary of state. Such a security amounts to a breach of\r\nthe constitution, and it is quite impossible that it could be made\r\navailable. It would do more injury to the constitution and the church,\r\nthan any thing which could be done by the Roman Catholics themselves,\r\nwhen placed by this bill in the same situation as dissenters.\r\n\r\nWith respect to communication with the Court of Rome, that has already\r\nbeen provided against and prevented by laws still in existence. Your\r\nLordships are aware that those laws, like many others regarding the\r\nRoman Catholic religion, are not strictly enforced, but still, if they\r\nshould be abused,--if the conduct of those persons whose actions those\r\nlaws are intended to regulate should be such as to render necessary the\r\ninterference of government, the very measure which is now before your\r\nlordships will enable government to interfere in such a manner as not\r\nonly to answer the object of its interference, but also to give\r\nsatisfaction to this house, and to the country.\r\n\r\n_April 2, 1829._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_Anticipation of success for the Measure. The parallel case of the\r\nScotch Church instanced._\r\n\r\nWhen I recommend this measure to your Lordships attention, you have,\r\nundoubtedly, a right to ask what are the reasons I have for believing\r\nthat it will effect the purpose for which it was intended.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote--The above extract and those which follow of the same date, are\r\nfrom the Duke's speech in introducing the Catholic Relief Bill.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, I believe it will answer its object, not only from the example\r\nof all Europe, but from the example of what occurred in a part of this\r\nkingdom on a former occasion. If I am not mistaken, at the time of the\r\ndispute between the Episcopalians and the Kirk of Scotland; the state of\r\nsociety in Scotland was as bad then as the state of society in Ireland\r\nis at the present moment. Your Lordships know that abroad, in other\r\nparts of Europe, in consequence of the diffusion of civil privileges to\r\nall classes, the difference between Protestant and Catholic is never\r\nheard. I am certain I can prove to your Lordships what I stated when I\r\nsaid, that the state of society in Scotland, previous to the concession\r\nof civil privileges to the Episcopalians, was as bad as the present\r\nstate of society in Ireland.\r\n\r\nI hope your Lordships will give me leave to read a petition which has\r\nbeen sent to me this day, and which was presented to the Scottish\r\nParliament at the period when those concessions were about to be made,\r\nand your Lordships will perceive that the petition is almost a model of\r\nmany petitions which have been read in this house respecting the\r\nquestion under discussion. I am, therefore, in expectation that should\r\nthe present bill pass this house, there will be no longer occasion for\r\nthose complaints which have been expressed to your Lordships, and that\r\nthe same happy and peaceful state of things which has for the last\r\ncentury prevailed in Scotland will also prevail in Ireland. I will, with\r\nyour Lordships' permission, read the petition I have alluded to, and I\r\nthink that after you have heard it, you will be of the same opinion as I\r\nam with respect to the similarity it bears to many petitions which have\r\nbeen presented to your Lordships on the Catholic question. The petition\r\nstates, that \"to grant toleration to that party (the Episcopalians) in\r\nthe present circumstances of the Church, must unavoidably shake the\r\nfoundation of our present happy constitution; overthrow those laws on\r\nwhich it is settled, grievously disturb that peace and tranquillity\r\nwhich the nation has enjoyed since the late revolution, disgust the\r\nminds of his Majesty's best subjects; increase animosity; confirm\r\ndiscord and tumult; weaken and enervate the discipline of the church;\r\nopen the door to unheard of vices, and to Popery as well as to other\r\nerrors; propagate and cherish disaffection to the government, and bring\r\nthe nation under the danger of falling back into those mischiefs and\r\ncalamities, from which it had lately escaped by the divine blessing. We,\r\ntherefore, humbly hope, that no concessions will be granted to that\r\nparty which would be to establish iniquity by law, and bring upon the\r\ncountry manifold calamities and disasters, from which we pray that\r\ngovernment may preserve the members of the high court of Parliament.\"\r\n\r\nI sincerely hope, that as the prophecy contained in this petition has\r\nnot been fulfilled, that a similar prophecy respecting the passing of\r\nthe present bill, contained in many petitions presented to your\r\nLordships, will not be fulfilled. But, my Lords, I have other grounds\r\nbesides those which I have already stated for supposing that the\r\nproposed measure will answer the object in view. There is no doubt, that\r\nafter this measure shall be adopted, the Roman Catholics can have no\r\nseparate interest as a separate sect,--for I am sure that neither this\r\nhouse, nor the other house of parliament, will be disposed to look upon\r\nthe Roman Catholics, or upon anything that respects Ireland, with any\r\nother eye than that with which they regard whatever affects the\r\ninterests of Scotland, or of this country. For my own part, I will\r\nstate, that if I am disappointed in the hopes which I entertained that\r\ntranquillity will result from this measure, I shall have no scruple in\r\ncoming down and laying before Parliament the state of the case. I shall\r\nact with the same confidence that parliament would support me then, as I\r\nhave acted in the present case.\r\n\r\n_April 2, 1829._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Abolition of the Jesuits and other Monastic Orders._\r\n\r\nAnother part of this bill has for its object, the putting an end to the\r\norder of the Jesuits and other monastic orders in this country. If your\r\nLordships will look at the act passed in the year 1791, you will\r\nprobably see that at that time, as well as in this, it was possible for\r\none person to make laws through which another might drive a coach and\r\nfour. My noble and learned friend (Lord Eldon) will excuse me for\r\nsaying, that notwithstanding all the pains which he took to draw up the\r\nact of 1791, yet the fact is,--of which there cannot be the smallest\r\ndoubt,--that large religious establishments have been regularly formed,\r\nnot only in Ireland, but also in this country. The measure which I now\r\npropose for your Lordships adoption will prevent the increase of such\r\nestablishments, and, without oppression to any individuals, without\r\ninjury to any body of men, will gradually put an end to those which have\r\nalready been formed. There is no man more convinced than I am of the\r\nabsolute necessity of carrying into execution that part of the present\r\nmeasure, which has for its object the extinction of monastic orders in\r\nthis country. I entertain no doubt whatever, that if that part of the\r\nmeasure be not carried into execution, we shall very soon see this\r\ncountry and Ireland inundated by Jesuits and regular monastic clergy,\r\nsent out from other parts of Europe, with means to establish themselves\r\nwithin his Majesty's kingdom.\r\n\r\n_April 2, 1829._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rationale of Roman Catholic Exclusion._\r\n\r\nMy Lords in the Bill of Rights there are some things permanently\r\nenacted, which I sincerely hope will be permanent; these are, the\r\nliberties of the people, the security for the Protestantism of the\r\nperson on the throne of these kingdoms, and that he shall not be married\r\nto a Papist. There is an oath of allegiance and supremacy to be taken by\r\nall those of whom that oath of allegiance is required, which is also\r\nsaid to be permanent; but it contains no declaration against\r\ntransubstantiation. There is also an oath of allegiance different from\r\nthat which is to be taken by a member of Parliament. I beg your\r\nLordships will observe, that although this oath of allegiance was\r\ndeclared permanent, it was altered in the last year of King William.\r\nThis shews what that \"permanent\" act was. Then, with respect to the\r\noaths to be taken by members of Parliament. I beg your Lordships to\r\nobserve that these oaths, the declaration against transubstantiation,\r\nand the sacrifice of the mass, are not originally in the act of William\r\nIII., they are in the act of 30th Charles II. During the reign of\r\nCharles II. there were certain oaths imposed, first on dissenters from\r\nthe church of England, by the 12th or 13th Charles II., and to exclude\r\nRoman Catholics by the 25th Charles II., and 30th Charles II. At the\r\nperiod of the Revolution, when King William came, he thought proper to\r\nextend the basis of his government, and he repealed the oaths affecting\r\nthe dissenters from the church of England, imposed by the 13th and 14th\r\nCharles II. and likewise that affirmative part of the oath of supremacy,\r\nwhich dissenters from the church of England could not take. That is the\r\nhistory of the alteration of these oaths by William III., from the time\r\nof Charles II.\r\n\r\nBut my Lords, the remainder of the oath could be taken by Dissenters,\r\nbut could not be taken by Roman Catholics. The danger with respect to\r\nRoman Catholics, had arisen in the time of Charles II., and still\r\nexisted in the time of William III.; but the oath was altered because\r\none of the great principles of the Revolution was to limit the exclusion\r\nfrom the benefits of the constitution as far as it was possible.\r\nTherefore we have this as one of the principles I before stated, derived\r\nfrom the Bill of Rights. The noble Lords state, that what they call the\r\nprinciples of 1688,--that is to say, these oaths excluding Roman\r\nCatholics, are equally permanent with the Bill of Rights by which the\r\nProtestantism of the crown is secured. If they will do me the favour to\r\nlook at the words of the act, they will see that the difference is just\r\nthe difference between that which is permanent and that which is not\r\npermanent. The act says that the Protestantism of the Crown shall last\r\nfor ever; but, as for these oaths, they are enacted in exclusive words,\r\nand there is not one word about how long they shall last. Well then, my\r\nLords, what follows? The next act we have is the act of Union with\r\nScotland; and what does that act say? That the oaths to be taken by the\r\nmembers of Parliament, as laid down by the 1st of William and Mary shall\r\ncontinue and be taken till Parliament shall otherwise direct. This is\r\nwhat is called a permanent act of Parliament, a permanent provision for\r\nall future periods, to exclude Catholics from seats in Parliament. My\r\nLords, I beg to observe that, if the act which excludes Roman Catholics\r\nfrom seats in Parliament, is permanent, there is another clause, (I\r\nbelieve the 10th of cap 8. 1st William and Mary) which requires\r\nofficers of the army and navy to take those very oaths previous to the\r\nacceptance of their commissions. Now if the act made in the first year\r\nof William and Mary, which excludes Roman Catholics from Parliament, is\r\npermanent, I should like to ask noble Lords, why the clause in that act\r\nis not equally permanent? I suppose that the noble and learned Lord will\r\nanswer my question by saying, that one act was permanent and ought to be\r\npermanently maintained, but that the other act was not permanent, and\r\nthe Parliament did right in repealing it in 1817. But the truth of the\r\nmatter is, that neither act was intended to be permanent; and the\r\nParliament of Queen Anne recognised by the Act of Union that the first\r\nact, relating to seats in Parliament, was not permanent; and the noble\r\nand learned Lord (Eldon) did right when he consented to the act of 1817,\r\nwhich put an end to the 10th clause of the 1st William III., cap. 8.\r\nThen, my Lords, if this principle of exclusion--if this principle of the\r\nconstitution of 1688, as it is called, be not permanent,--if it be\r\nrecognised as not permanent, not only by the act of union with Scotland,\r\n(in which it was said that the exclusive oath should continue till\r\nParliament otherwise provided,) but also by the late act of Union with\r\nIreland, I would ask your Lordships, whether you are not at liberty now\r\nto consider the expediency of doing away with it altogether, in order to\r\nrelieve the country from the inconveniences to which I have already\r\nadverted? I would ask your Lordships, whether you are not called upon\r\nto review the state of the representation of Ireland,--whether you are\r\nnot called upon to see, even supposing that the principle were a\r\npermanent one, if it be fit that Parliament should remain, as it has\r\nremained for some time, groaning under Popish influence exercised by the\r\nPriests over the elections in Ireland. I would ask your Lordships, I\r\nrepeat, whether it is not right to make an arrangement, which has for\r\nits object, not only the settlement of this question, but at the same\r\ntime to relieve the country from the inconveniences I have mentioned. I\r\nhave already stated the manner in which the organization I have alluded\r\nto, works upon all the great interests of the country; but I wish your\r\nLordships particularly to attend to the manner in which it works upon\r\nthe church itself. That part of the church of England which exists in\r\nIreland is in a very peculiar situation; it is the church of the\r\nminority of the people. At the same time, I believe that a more\r\nexemplary, a more pious, or a more learned body of men, than the members\r\nof that church do not exist. The members of that church certainly enjoy\r\nand deserve the affections of those whom they are sent to instruct, in\r\nthe same degree as their brethren in England enjoy the affections of the\r\npeople of this country; and I have no doubt that they would shed the\r\nlast drop of their blood in defence of the doctrines and discipline of\r\ntheir church. But violence, I apprehend, is likely to affect the\r\ninterests of that church; and I would put it to the House, whether that\r\nchurch can be better protected from violence by a government united in\r\nitself, united with Parliament and united in sentiment with the great\r\nbody of the people, or by a government disunited in opinion, disunited\r\nfrom Parliament, and by the two houses of Parliament disunited. I am\r\ncertain that no man can look to the situation of Ireland, without seeing\r\nthat the interest of the church as well as the interest of every class\r\nof persons under government, is involved in such a settlement of this\r\nquestion, as will bring with it strength to the government, and strength\r\nto every department of the state.\r\n\r\nThe bill before the House concedes to Roman Catholics the power of\r\nholding any office in the state, excepting a few connected with the\r\nadministration of the affairs of the church; and it also concedes to\r\nthem the power of becoming members of Parliament. I believe it goes\r\nfurther, with respect to the concession of offices, than any former\r\nmeasure which has been introduced into the other House of Parliament. I\r\nconfess that the reasons which induced me to consider it my duty to make\r\nsuch large concessions now, arose out of the effects which I observed\r\nfollowing the acts proposed in the years 1782 and 1793. I have seen that\r\nany restriction upon concession has only had the effect of increasing\r\nthe demands of the Roman Catholics, and at the same time giving them\r\nfresh power to enforce those demands. I have, therefore, considered it\r\nmy duty, in making this act of concession, to make it as large as any\r\nreasonable man can expect it to be; seeing clearly that any thing which\r\nmight remain behind would only give ground for fresh demands, and being\r\nconvinced that the settlement of this question tends to the security of\r\nthe state, and to the peace and prosperity of the country. I have\r\nalready stated to your lordships my opinion respecting the expediency of\r\ngranting seats in Parliament to Roman Catholics; and I do not conceive,\r\nthat the concession of seats in Parliament, can in any manner effect any\r\nquestion relative to the church of England. In the first place, I beg\r\nyour Lordships to recollect, that at the time those acts, to which I\r\nhave before alluded,--the one passed in the 30th of Charles II., and the\r\nother at the period of the Revolution, were enacted--it was not the\r\nchurch that was in danger--it was the state. It was the state that was\r\nin danger; and from what? Not because the safety of the church was\r\nthreatened. No; but because the Sovereign on the throne was suspected of\r\nPopery, and because the successor to the throne was actually a Papist.\r\nThose laws were adopted, because of the existence of a danger which\r\nthreatened the state, and not of one which threatened the church. On the\r\ncontrary, at that period danger to the church was apprehended, not from\r\nthe Roman Catholics, but from the Dissenters from the church of England.\r\nI would ask of your Lordships, all of whom have read the history of\r\nthose times, whether any danger to the church was apprehended from the\r\nRoman Catholics? No! Danger to the church was apprehended from the\r\nDissenters, who had become powerful by the privileges granted to them\r\nunder the act of Parliament passed at the period of the Revolution. I\r\nthink, therefore, that it is not necessary for me to enter into any\r\njustification of myself for having adopted this measure, on account of\r\nany danger which might be apprehended from it to the church. Roman\r\nCatholics will come into Parliament under this bill, as they went into\r\nParliament previous to the act of 30th Charles II. They sat in\r\nParliament up to that period, and were not obliged to take the oath of\r\nsupremacy. But by this bill they will be required to take the oath of\r\nallegiance, in which a great part of the oath of supremacy is\r\nincluded--namely, that part which refers to the jurisdiction of foreign\r\npotentates; and, I must say, that the church, if in danger, is better\r\nsecured by the bill than it was previous to the 30th of Charles II. The\r\nobject for which that act was recognised at the period of the\r\nRevolution--namely, to keep out the house of Stuart from the throne--has\r\nlong ceased to exist, by the extinction of that family. It is the\r\nopinion of nearly every considerable man in the country (of nearly all\r\nthose who are competent to form a judgment on the question), that the\r\ntime has now arrived for repealing these laws. Circumstances have been\r\ngradually tending towards their repeal since the extinction of the house\r\nof Stuart; and at last the period has come, when it is quite clear that\r\nthe repeal can be no longer delayed with safety to the state.\r\n\r\n_April 2, 1829._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_State of Ireland, a Reason for Emancipation._\r\n\r\nI know that, by some, it has been considered that the state of Ireland\r\nhas nothing to do with this question--that it is a subject which ought\r\nto be left entirely out of our consideration. My Lords, they tell us\r\nthat Ireland has been disturbed for the last thirty years--that to such\r\ndisturbance we have been accustomed--and that it does not at all alter\r\nthe circumstances of the case, as they have hitherto appeared. My Lords,\r\nit is perfectly true that Ireland has been disturbed during the long\r\nperiod I have stated, but within the last year or two, there have been\r\ncircumstances of particular aggravation. Political circumstances have,\r\nin a considerable degree, occasioned that aggravation; but, besides\r\nthis, my Lords, I must say, although I have no positive legal proof of\r\nthe fact, that I have every reason to believe that there has been a\r\nconsiderable organization of the people for the purpose of mischief. My\r\nLords, this organization is, it appears to me, to be proved, not only by\r\nthe declarations of those who formed, and who arranged it, but likewise\r\nby the effects which it has produced in the election of churchwardens\r\nthroughout the country; in the circumstances attending the election for\r\nthe county of Clare, and that preceded and followed that election; in\r\nthe proceedings of a gentleman who went at the head of a body of men to\r\nthe north of Ireland; in the simultaneous proceedings of various bodies\r\nof men in the south of Ireland, in Templemore, in Kilenaule, Cahir,\r\nClonmel, and other places; in the proceedings of another gentleman in\r\nthe King's county; and in the recall of the former gentleman from the\r\nnorth of Ireland by the Roman Catholic Association. In all these\r\ncircumstances it is quite obvious to me, that there was an organization\r\nand direction by some superior authority. This organization has\r\ncertainly produced a state of society in Ireland which we have not\r\nheretofore witnessed, and an aggravation of all the evils which before\r\nafflicted that unfortunate country.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, late in the year, a considerable town was attacked, in the\r\nmiddle of the night by a body of people who came from the neighbouring\r\nmountains--the town of Augher. They attacked it with arms, and were\r\ndriven from it with arms by the inhabitants of the town. This is a state\r\nof things which I feel your Lordships will admit ought not to exist in a\r\ncivilized country. Later in the year still, a similar event occurred in\r\nCharleville; and, in the course of the last autumn, the Roman Catholic\r\nAssociation deliberated upon the propriety of adopting, and the means of\r\nadopting, the measure of ceasing all dealings between Roman Catholics\r\nand Protestants. Is it possible to believe supposing these dealings had\r\nceased, supposing this measure had been carried into execution--as I\r\nfirmly believe it was in the power of those who deliberated upon it to\r\ncarry it into execution--is it possible to believe that those who would\r\ncease those dealings would not likewise have ceased to carry into\r\nexecution the contracts into which they had entered? Will any man say\r\nthat people in this situation are not verging towards that state, in\r\nwhich it would be impossible to expect from them that they would be able\r\nto perform the duties of jurymen, or to administer justice between man\r\nand man, for the protection of the lives and properties of his Majesty's\r\nsubjects? My Lords, this is the state of society to which I wished to\r\ndraw your attention, and for which it is necessary that Parliament\r\nshould provide a remedy.\r\n\r\n_April 2, 1829._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Emancipation claimed as the Price of the Union._\r\n\r\nI am old enough to remember the rebellion in 1798. I was not employed in\r\nIreland at the time--was employed in another part of his Majesty's\r\ndominions; but, my Lords, if I am not mistaken, the Parliament of\r\nIreland, at that time, walked up to my Lord Lieutenant with an unanimous\r\naddress, beseeching his Excellency to take every means to put down that\r\nunnatural rebellion, and promising their full support, in order to carry\r\nthose measures into execution. The Lord Lieutenant did take measures,\r\nand did succeed in putting down that rebellion. Well, my Lords, what\r\nhappened in the very next session? The Government proposed to put an end\r\nto the Parliament, and to form a Legislative Union between the two\r\nkingdoms, for the purpose, principally, of proposing this very measure;\r\nand, in point of fact, the very first measure that was proposed after\r\nthis Legislative Union, after those successful endeavours to put down\r\nthis rebellion, was the very measure with which I am now about to\r\ntrouble your Lordships. Is it possible noble Lords can believe that,\r\nsupposing there was a renewal of the contest to which I have\r\nreferred--is it possible noble Lords can believe that such a contest\r\ncould be carried on without the consent of the other House of\r\nParliament? I am certain, my Lords, that, when you look at the division\r\nof opinion which prevails in both Houses of Parliament; when you look at\r\nthe division of opinion which prevails in every family of this kingdom,\r\nand of Ireland--in every family, I say, from the most eminent in\r\nstation, down to the lowest in this country;--when you look at the\r\ndivision of opinion that prevails among the Protestants of Ireland on\r\nthis subject; I am convinced you will see that there would be a vast\r\ndifference in a contest carried on now, and that which was carried on on\r\nformer occasions.\r\n\r\n_April 2, 1829._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_No Remedy for the State of Ireland but Emancipation._\r\n\r\nNeither the law, nor the means in the possession of Government, enabled\r\nGovernment to put an end to the state of things in Ireland. Therefore,\r\nwe come to Parliament. Now let us see what chance there was of providing\r\na remedy for this state of things by coming to Parliament. My Lords, we\r\nall recollect perfectly well, that the opinion of the majority in\r\nanother place is, that the remedy for this state of things in Ireland is\r\na repeal of the disabilities affecting his Majesty's Roman Catholic\r\nsubjects. We might have gone and asked Parliament to enable us to put\r\ndown the Roman Catholic Association; but what chance had we of\r\nprevailing upon Parliament to pass such a bill, without being prepared\r\nto come forward and state that we were ready to consider the whole\r\ncondition of Ireland, with a view to apply a remedy to that which\r\nParliament had stated to be the cause of the disease? Suppose that\r\nParliament had given us a bill to put down the Roman Catholic\r\nAssociation, would such a law as that be a remedy for the state of\r\nthings which I have already described to your Lordships as existing in\r\nIreland? Would it do any one thing towards putting an end to the\r\norganization, which I have stated to your Lordships exists--towards\r\nputting down the mischiefs which are the consequences of that\r\norganization--towards giving you the means of getting the better of the\r\nstate of things existing in Ireland, unless some further measure were\r\nadopted? But, my Lords, it is said, if that will not do, let us proceed\r\nto blows. What is meant by proceeding to \"blows,\" is civil war. Now, I\r\nbelieve that every Government must be prepared to carry into execution\r\nthe laws of the country by the force placed at its disposition, not by\r\nthe military force, unless it should be absolutely necessary, but by the\r\nmilitary force in case that should be necessary; and, above all things,\r\noppose resistance to the law, in case the disaffected, or ill-disposed,\r\nare inclined to resist the authority, or sentence of the law; but, in\r\nthis case, as I have already stated to your Lordships, there was no\r\nresistance of the law--nay, I will go further, and will say that I am\r\npositively certain that this state of things existing in Ireland, for\r\nthe last year and a half, bordering upon civil war (being attended by\r\nnearly all the evils of civil war), might have continued a considerable\r\ntime longer, to the great injury and disgrace of the country, and,\r\nnevertheless, those who managed this state of things--those who were at\r\nits head--would have taken care to prevent any resistance to the law,\r\nwhich must have ended, they knew as well as I did, in the only way in\r\nwhich a struggle against the King's Government could end. They knew\r\nperfectly well they would have been the first victims of that\r\nresistance; but knowing that, and knowing, as I do, that they are\r\nsensible, able men, and perfectly aware of the materials upon which they\r\nhave to work, I have not the smallest doubt that the state of things\r\nwhich I have stated to your Lordships would have continued, and that you\r\nwould now have had an opportunity of putting it down in the manner some\r\nnoble Lords imagined. But, my Lords, even if I had been certain of such\r\nmeans of putting it down, I should have considered it my duty to avoid\r\nthose means.\r\n\r\n_April 2, 1829._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Would sacrifice his Life to prevent one Month of Civil War._\r\n\r\nI am one of those who have, probably, passed a longer period of my life\r\nengaged in war than most men, and principally in civil war; and, I must\r\nsay this, that if I could avoid, by any sacrifice whatever, even one\r\nmonth of civil war in the country to which I was attached, I would\r\nsacrifice my life in order to do it. I say, there is nothing which\r\ndestroys property, eats up prosperity by the roots, and demoralizes the\r\ncharacter, to the degree that civil war does; in such a crisis, the hand\r\nof man is raised against his neighbour, against his brother, and against\r\nhis father; servant betrays master, and the whole scene ends in\r\nconfusion and devastation. Yet, my Lords, this is the resource to which\r\nwe must have looked--these are the means which we must have applied, in\r\norder to have put an end to this state of things, if we had not made the\r\noption of bringing forward the measures, for which, I say, I am\r\nresponsible. But let us look a little further. If civil war is so bad,\r\nwhen it is occasioned by resistance to the Government, if it is so bad\r\nin the case I have stated, and so much to be avoided, how much more is\r\nit to be avoided, when we are to arm the people, in order that we may\r\nconquer one part of them, by exciting the other part against them?\r\n\r\n_April 2, 1829._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Defence of the Government from the Charge of Inconsistency._\r\n\r\nAnother subject to which I wish to advert, is a charge brought against\r\nseveral of my colleagues, and also against myself, of a want of\r\nconsistency in our conduct. My Lords, I admit that many of my\r\ncolleagues, as well as myself, did on former occasions, vote against a\r\nmeasure of a similar description with this; and my Lords, I must say,\r\nthat my colleagues and myself felt, when we adopted this measure, that\r\nwe should be sacrificing ourselves, and our popularity to that which we\r\nfelt to be our duty to our sovereign and our country.\r\n\r\nWe knew very well that if we put ourselves at the head of the Protestant\r\ncry of \"No Popery,\" we should be much more popular even than those who\r\nhave excited that very cry against us. But we felt that, in so doing, we\r\nshould have left on the interests of the country a burden, which must\r\nend in bearing them down; and further, that we should deserve the hate\r\nand execration of our countrymen. The noble Earl on the cross bench\r\n(Winchelsea) has adverted particularly to me, and has mentioned in terms\r\nof civility the services which he says I have rendered to the country;\r\nbut I must tell the noble Earl that be those services what they may, I\r\nrendered them through good repute, and through bad repute, and that I\r\nwas never prevented from rendering them by any cry which was excited\r\nagainst me at the moment. Then, I am accused by a noble and learned\r\nfriend of mine, (the Earl of Eldon) of having acted with great secresy\r\nrespecting this measure. Now I beg to tell my noble and learned\r\nfriend--and I am sorry that, in the course of these discussions,\r\nanything has passed which has been unpleasant to my noble and learned\r\nfriend,--I beg to tell him, I say, that, he has done that to me in the\r\ncourse of this discussion which he complains of others having done to\r\nhim;--in other words, he has, in the words of a right honourable friend\r\nof his and mine, thrown a large paving stone, instead of throwing a\r\nsmall pebble stone. I say, that if my noble and learned friend accuses\r\nme of acting with secresy on this question, he does not deal with me\r\naltogether fairly. He knows, as well as I do, how the Cabinet was\r\nconstructed on this question; and I ask him, had I any right to say a\r\nsingle word to any man whatsoever on this measure, until the person most\r\ninterested in the kingdom upon it had given his consent to my speaking\r\nout? I say, that before my noble and learned friend accused me of\r\nsecresy, and improper secresy too, he ought to have known the precise\r\nday upon which I received the permission of the highest personage in\r\nthis country; and he ought not to have accused me of improper conduct,\r\nuntil he knew the day on which I had leave to open my mouth upon this\r\nmeasure. There is another point also upon which the noble Earl accused\r\nme of misconduct, and that is that I did not at once dissolve the\r\nparliament. Now, I must say, that I think noble Lords are mistaken in\r\nthe notion of the benefits which they think they would derive from a\r\ndissolution of parliament at this crisis. I believe that many of them\r\nare not aware of the consequences and of the inconveniences of a\r\ndissolution of parliament at any time. But when I knew, as I did know,\r\nand as I do know, the state of the elective franchise in Ireland in the\r\ncourse of last summer,--when I knew the consequences which a dissolution\r\nwould produce on the return to the house of commons, to say nothing of\r\nthe risk which must have occurred at each election,--of collisions that\r\nmight have led to something little short of civil war,--I say, that\r\nknowing all these things, I should have been wanting in duty to my\r\nSovereign, and to my country, if I had advised his Majesty to dissolve\r\nhis parliament.\r\n\r\n_April 4, 1829._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_No Danger to the Church from the Emancipation Bill._\r\n\r\nIt has been repeatedly assumed by many of your Lordships in the course\r\nof the discussion, but particularly by the right reverend Prelates who\r\nhave spoken, that the church of Ireland (or, as I have recently been\r\nreminded, the church of England in Ireland) is in danger. I call on\r\nthose who apprehend that danger to state clearly whether that danger, on\r\nthis particular occasion, is more to be expected as resulting from\r\nlegislation, or from violence. If they say it is resulting from\r\nlegislation, I answer that their apprehensions are puerile. It is\r\nimpossible to suppose that a small number of persons admitted into this\r\nhouse, and a small number admitted into the other house, while we have a\r\nProtestant Sovereign upon the throne, should be productive of\r\nlegislative danger to the church of England in Ireland. I beg to\r\nobserve, with respect to the point relating to the union of the two\r\ncountries, that a fundamental article of the union is the junction of\r\nthe two Churches, called the United Churches of England and Ireland. It\r\nis impossible, therefore, that any mischief can occur to the Church of\r\nIreland, without a breach in the union of the two countries. There is\r\nanother point to which I beg leave to advert for a moment. Although it\r\nis true that we do admit into parliament members of the Roman Catholic\r\npersuasion, yet, at the same time, by another measure brought forward\r\nwith it, and on which we equally rely, we propose regulations which will\r\nhave the effect of destroying the influence of the Catholic priesthood\r\nin the election of members of parliament. We have carefully examined the\r\nmeasure, and do expect that it will give additional security to all the\r\ninterests of the state.\r\n\r\n_April 4, 1829._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_English Soldiers respect the Religion of other Nations._\r\n\r\nAlthough I have served in my profession in several countries, and among\r\nforeigners, some of whom professed various forms of the Christian\r\nreligion, while others did not profess it at all; I never was in one in\r\nwhich it was not the bounden duty of the soldier to pay proper deference\r\nand respect to whatever happened to be the religious institutions or\r\nceremonies of the place where he might happen to be. We soldiers do not\r\ngo into these foreign countries to become parties to the religious\r\ndifferences of the people, or to trouble ourselves with their notions\r\nupon matters of faith. We go to perform a very different kind of\r\nduty,--one which is purely military, and has no reference to the\r\npeople's religion. I confess I never heard, however, that it was our\r\ncustom to take any part in their religious rites, nor do I believe we\r\nhave taken any such part. Indeed, I have never heard of anything like\r\nany co-operation by our soldiers of military parade, except at Malta,\r\nwhere I know it has long been the practice of the garrison to direct\r\nsome artillery officers to cause a few small guns to be fired, as some\r\nparticular procession passes the platform. And I know that certain\r\nofficers of the artillery, or military, three of them, I believe,\r\nthought proper on military grounds, and not upon religious scruples, to\r\nrefuse to fire, according to the usual order of their commandant--for\r\nsuch refusal they were brought to a court-martial, and sentenced to be\r\ncashiered, not because they would not form a part of any religious\r\nprocession to which they were hostile--not because they would not\r\nconform to the rites of the natives, and worship any relic that was\r\nhonoured by them; but for this plain and intelligible reason,--that they\r\nhad taken upon themselves to refuse obedience to the orders of the\r\ncommander-in-chief on the spot.\r\n\r\n_April 8, 1829._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The real meaning of Irish Agitation._\r\n\r\nIf you glance at the history of Ireland during the last ten years, you\r\nwill find that agitation really means something just short of rebellion;\r\nthat, and no other, is the exact meaning of the word. It is to place the\r\ncountry in that state in which its government is utterly impracticable,\r\nexcept by means of an overawing military force.\r\n\r\n_May 4, 1829._\r\n\r\n_Theory of a Metallic Currency._\r\n\r\nThe restoration of the currency, my Lords, has, in truth, but little to\r\ndo with the distress of the country. Since the restoration of the\r\ncurrency, the revenue has risen to the amount which has been stated to\r\nyour Lordships, notwithstanding the repeal of taxes to the amount of\r\n27,000,000 l., since 1814. The fact is, that at the present moment, the\r\nrevenue produces, in real currency, much more than it produced when the\r\nwar was terminated. Is not that circumstance alone, I ask your\r\nLordships, a proof of the increasing prosperity of the country? But, my\r\nLords, I did not rest my argument on that fact only. Notwithstanding,\r\nthere is, at present, much distress, still, in the last year, there was\r\nan increase of produce in every branch of manufacture, in every branch\r\nof industry, beyond what was apparent in the three preceding years.\r\nUnder these circumstances, your Lordships must ascribe the distress of\r\nthe country to something else, rather than to the alteration of the\r\ncurrency. My opinion is, that the people, during the lengthened war\r\nwhich existed previously to the peace of 1815--during that period, when\r\nthere was an enormous expenditure--acquired habits which they cannot\r\nreadily throw aside. During that time, any man, of whatever description\r\nof credit, could obtain money, or the semblance of money, to carry on\r\nany speculation. The people then employed a fictitious wealth; they\r\nproceeded on a system, which could not be continued, without mining and\r\ndestroying the country; and that system having been destroyed, that\r\nfictitious wealth having been removed, they cannot immediately come down\r\nto those quiet habits, which are required from them under that state of\r\nthings now prevailing in the empire. That, my Lords, is the real cause\r\nof the distress under which they are at present suffering. Besides, your\r\nLordships will recollect, that the population of the country has\r\nenormously increased; and it should also be taken into the calculation,\r\nthat the power of production by machinery has increased in an\r\nincalculable degree. As much can now be produced in one year, as\r\nformerly could be produced in five years; and the produce of one year\r\nnow amounts to more than can be taken off our hands in a year and a\r\nhalf, or even two years. Distress, therefore, has occurred,\r\nnotwithstanding that the utmost exertions have been made to repel it;\r\nand notwithstanding the great and general prosperity of trade throughout\r\nthe world. My Lords, the plain fact is, that owing to the alterations of\r\ntrade--a great demand at one time, and a want of demand at another--the\r\nmanufacturers, and those engaged in commercial pursuits, must sustain\r\nconsiderable distress at different periods. It has been recommended as a\r\nremedy, that Government should go back to the system of the circulation\r\nof the notes. Now, my Lords, with respect to the one-pound bank\r\nnotes--it will be well to recollect what has been the proceeding of\r\nParliament on that subject. In 1826, Parliament having seen the facility\r\nwith which speculations could be undertaken by persons possessing no\r\ncapital, in consequence of the circulation of those one-pound\r\nbank-notes--looking to the evils that resulted from those speculations,\r\nand finding that a great number of banks in the country had failed in\r\nconsequence of such speculations--thought proper to pass a law to\r\nprevent the circulation of this species of paper, after the lapse of\r\nthree years. A noble Lord has said, that this measure of Parliament\r\noccasioned the failure of a great number of country bankers. But, I beg\r\nthe noble Lord's pardon, he has not stated the fact correctly. Most of\r\nthe banks which about that period failed, it ought to be recollected,\r\nbroke previously to the meeting of Parliament. The fact is, that it was\r\nthe breaking of the banks which occasioned the measure, and not the\r\nmeasure the breaking of the banks. But we have now accomplished the\r\nmeasure adopted in 1826; that measure is now carried into execution; the\r\ncurrency of the country is now sufficient; bank notes, 5l., and above\r\n5l., in value, are in circulation; and I will assert this fact, that\r\nthere is at present more of what I may call State currency in\r\ncirculation--more notes of the Bank of England and sovereigns--a greater\r\nquantity of circulating medium of those two denominations, than there\r\nhas been at any former period before the late war, or before the Bank\r\nRestriction Act was passed. I beg leave, my Lords, to ask, what want is\r\nthere of any additional circulation, when the circulation is at present\r\ngreater than it ever was? Is it necessary to have a more extended\r\ncirculation, to afford the means of procuring loans of money to those\r\nwho have no capital and no credit? I contend that this is a state of\r\nthings that ought not to exist in any country. Persons who really\r\npossess credit, can raise money at the present moment with every\r\nfacility that is reasonable or proper. But, undoubtedly, those who have\r\nno credit, are deprived of the facilities of borrowing money, which they\r\nformerly enjoyed, because there is no longer a large class of persons\r\ndealing in one-pound notes, to assist them in carrying on their\r\nspeculations. This is the real state of the case. It was this situation\r\nof affairs that gave rise, and justly gave rise, to the measure of\r\n1826--a measure which, I trust, that Parliament will persevere in, for\r\nthe purpose of placing the country in a proper state. It has been said\r\ntruly, that nothing is so desirable as to see the country carrying on\r\nits mercantile transactions with a paper currency founded on, and\r\nsupported by, a metallic basis. Now, your Lordships must be aware, that\r\nis exactly the sort of currency which the country has got at present;\r\nand, in proportion as the country goes on conquering its\r\ndifficulties--the existence of that currency still being continued--we\r\nshall see prosperity daily revive, and we shall see mercantile\r\ntransactions carried on as they ought to be, without any mixture of\r\nthose ruinous speculations, to which so much of the prevailing distress\r\nmust be attributed. But, my Lords, the noble Lord in tracing out the\r\nsources of this distress, has omitted one of the great causes of it. He\r\nhas not adverted to the immense loss of capital which has been sustained\r\nby the country during the last six or eight years, in consequence of\r\nloans to foreign powers--of which neither principal or interest has been\r\npaid, nor ever will, in my opinion, be paid. The noble Lord has not\r\nadverted to the effect which that loss of capital must have produced,\r\nwith respect to the employment of industry in all parts of the country.\r\nIn the next place, the noble Lord has not adverted to the effect which\r\nthose loans must have had on the trade and manufactures of the country,\r\nin consequence of the glut in foreign markets, occasioned by the forced\r\nexportation of goods on account of such transactions. In most instances,\r\nmy Lords, no returns were made on account of those goods, and even when\r\nreturns were made, they were of the most unsatisfactory description. The\r\nnoble Lord has not adverted to the fact, that these returns, when any\r\nwere received, came home in the shape of interest, and did not, of\r\ncourse, require any demand or export from this country. Surely all these\r\nthings should be considered, when the noble Lord speaks of the distress\r\nthe country is labouring under. That distress has fallen not only on the\r\nmanufacturing and commercial interests, but also on those who have\r\nencouraged and embarked in the various schemes and speculations which\r\nhave done the country so much mischief.\r\n\r\n_May 26, 1829._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_Extended Currency means unlimited creation of Paper Money by\r\nIndividuals._\r\n\r\nI will now say a few words upon the remedy proposed by the noble Lord\r\n(the Earl of Carnarvon), who has totally misunderstood the argument of\r\nthe noble Viscount (Goderich). My noble Friend stated that the revenue,\r\nin 1815, was 80,000,000 l. sterling, in paper currency; that taxes were\r\nfirst of all repealed to the amount of 18,000,000 l., and afterwards to\r\nthe amount of 9,000,000 l., making in all 27,000.000 l.; and he says that\r\nthe revenue now produces, in a sound currency, as great an amount as it\r\nproduced in a depreciated currency; that is to say, that it produces now\r\na sum, in sound currency, which, in paper currency, would amount to\r\n80,000,000 l. sterling. Those persons who consume the articles which\r\nproduce the revenue, must be able to purchase them, or the revenue could\r\nnot exist. The increase of the revenue is a proof, then, that\r\nconsumption has increased full one-third since the time when the taxes\r\nwere reduced. It is utterly impossible that a country in which, within a\r\nperiod of fifteen years, the revenue has risen one-third, can be\r\nsuffering universal and unexampled distress. The noble Lord has thought\r\nproper to refer the distress to a deficient circulation, and he\r\nrecommends a system which he thinks would remedy the evil. Now, I will\r\ntell the noble Earl that the largest amount of currency in circulation,\r\nat any time during the Bank Restriction Act, was 65,000,000 l. sterling.\r\nThe Bank of England notes were 20,000,000 l.; country bank paper,\r\n23,000,000 l.; gold, 4,000,000 l.; and, silver, 7,000,000 l. But, in 1830,\r\nthe amount of Bank of England paper in circulation is 19,900,000 l.; and,\r\nof country bank paper, 9,200,000 l.; of gold, 28,000,000 l.; and, of\r\nsilver. 8,000,000 l.; making a total of 65,000,000 l. It is certain,\r\ntherefore, that there is more money in circulation now, than there was\r\nat any period of the Bank restriction. There can be no want, therefore,\r\nof more currency. The noble Earl says he wants an extended currency; but\r\nwhat he, in fact, wants, is not an extended currency, but an unlimited\r\ncurrency. He would give an unlimited power to certain individuals, not\r\nto the Crown, to coin as much money as they please. The noble Lord wants\r\nto give them the power of lending capital to whomsoever they might think\r\nproper thus to indulge. That is what the noble Lord recommends, but that\r\nis what, I say, cannot be allowed, without bringing the country again to\r\nthe brink of ruin, from which it was extricated in the year 1826.\r\n\r\nThe noble Lord tells you that, heretofore, a farmer, with a good stock,\r\nwas able to borrow capital to carry on his business; but that now, let\r\nhis corn-yard be ever so full, he cannot borrow a shilling, because the\r\nbanker has not the power of giving him one-pound notes. The noble Lord\r\nsays--the banker gets no interest upon his own capital, and therefore\r\nwill not lend it. My Lords, the banker who lends his capital to a\r\nfarmer, or trader, does obtain interest for the use of it, in the shape\r\nof discount upon the bill, or other security, which the borrower gives\r\nhim. The question with him, at present, is one of security, and not of\r\nprofit. If the banker should lend, under existing circumstances, he must\r\nlend his own real capital, and not a fictitious capital in the shape of\r\none pound notes, created for the purpose. He must be certain that the\r\nsecurity given to him is good and available, as it ought to be; and if\r\nhe is not satisfied with the profits arising from the use of his\r\ncapital, it is because he thinks the risk is so great as not to be\r\ncovered by the profits. The noble Lord would wish to pledge your\r\nLordships, by your votes this night, to give the country bankers\r\nadditional profits, by enabling them to coin money, or to create\r\nfictitious paper to any extent, and thus to create a fictitious capital.\r\n\r\n_February 4, 1830._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_Taxes reduced under a Metallic Currency._\r\n\r\nIn answer to all the declamations we have heard this night respecting\r\nthe evils resulting from a metallic currency, I beg leave to remind the\r\nHouse of some facts; since the year 1815, and principally since the Bank\r\nrestriction was taken off, measures have been adopted to relieve the\r\ncountry of taxes to the amount of 27,000,000 l. sterling; and measures\r\nhave been also adopted which have reduced the charges of the national\r\ndebt between 3,000,000 l. and 4,000,000 l. a year, that being the interest\r\non nearly 100,000,000 l. sterling. I beg your Lordships will bear this\r\ncircumstance in mind; and let me tell you, that all the advantages of a\r\nso-called equitable adjustment will never equal the advantage already\r\nobtained from an adherence to the principles of justice and good faith.\r\n\r\n\r\n_February 4, 1830._\r\n\r\n_Causes of Manufacturing Distress._\r\n\r\nI wish to know whether the competition of machinery and the universal\r\napplication of steam which has been generally introduced since the\r\npeace, have not occasioned a decrease in the demand for labour, and have\r\nnot lowered the wages of labour in manufactures? Must we not take into\r\nconsideration the general spirit of manufacture abroad, the competition\r\nof foreign nations in foreign markets, and the universal use of\r\nmachinery worked by steam? How can we control the subjects of foreign\r\npowers? We must seek foreign markets for our surplus produce. How can we\r\nprevent steam from creating competition abroad in the sale of that\r\nproduce, as well as a fall in the wages of manufactures, and thus\r\noccasioning a part of the distress complained of?\r\n\r\n_Feb. 4, 1830._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_Distress exaggerated._\r\n\r\nIf the exports of Great Britain have gone on increasing for some\r\nyears--if they were greater last year than in any former year--if the\r\namount of our exports is now greater than ever it was,--I say, not only\r\nthat these are the strongest symptoms of the prosperity of the country\r\nincreasing, but that the distress cannot be so great and unexampled as\r\nthe noble Earl (Carnarvon) would make it. There is not a rail-road, or a\r\ncommon road, or a canal in the country, on which the traffic has not\r\nincreased every year during the last few years, and particularly in the\r\nlast year. It may be true that there is a diminution of profit in\r\ncommercial transactions in general; but profit there must be, or men\r\nwould not devote themselves for years to these pursuits. Money would not\r\nbe laid out in the conveyance from place to place of the produce and\r\nmanufactures of the country. The traffic being greater than ever it was\r\nbefore, it is impossible but what it must be to the advantage of\r\nsomebody. The distress then cannot be so universal as represented. The\r\nprofit and advantage may not be so great as they were some years back;\r\nbut still advantage there is.\r\n\r\nThere are other circumstances well worthy the attention of the House in\r\nthe consideration of this subject. The retail dealers are a very\r\nnumerous body in this country. Consider of their profits. Look at nearly\r\nevery market town in the kingdom, and many villages in progress towards\r\nbeing rebuilt. Who pays the money for re-building these houses? Who pays\r\nthe increased rents for them? Are the people ruined who require and can\r\npay for these new houses? My Lords, these are facts which do shew that,\r\nnotwithstanding the existing distress which every man must deplore, the\r\ncountry, in spite of the pressure upon it, is upon the whole, rising.\r\n\r\n_Feb. 4, 1830._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_Proofs of National Improvement in 1830._\r\n\r\nAmong other topics of accusation, I have been arraigned for my\r\nassertion on the first day of the session, that the distress of the\r\ncountry was not of that magnitude which some persons have affirmed. The\r\nnoble Lord (Stanhope) is quite at liberty to indulge in such invectives\r\nif it pleases him to do so, but if he supposes I do not feel for the\r\ndistresses of the people, he is utterly mistaken, as I can sincerely\r\naver that I have as strong sympathies on the subject as any noble member\r\nof this house. But I am resolved to tell plainly and honestly what I\r\nthink, quite regardless of the odium I may incur from those whose\r\nprejudices my candour and sincerity may offend. I am here to speak the\r\ntruth and not to flatter the prejudices and prepossessions of any man.\r\nIn speaking the truth, I shall utter it in the language that truth\r\nitself most naturally suggests.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI request your Lordships to look at the state of the savings banks. A\r\nmeasure was sometime back adopted to prevent the investment of money in\r\nthese banks beyond a certain amount for each person, in order that the\r\nparties not entitled to it should not derive the advantage which is\r\nintended for the poorer classes. Large sums were drawn out of those\r\nbanks soon after; but they have since revived in some degree. Whence has\r\nthe money come? From the lower classes. This cannot be considered as a\r\nproof of general distress. Your Lordships ought likewise not to omit\r\nfrom your consideration the increased traffic carried on the railroads\r\nand canals in the country. The noble Earl (Roseberry) has told your\r\nLordships, that I have availed myself of the increased traffic upon the\r\nroads and canals by merchants and manufacturers--in despair seeking a\r\nmarket--in order to represent the country in a state of prosperity;\r\nwhereas it is an additional symptom of distress. My Lords, I said that\r\nthis traffic had been increasing for years; and that it had, in some\r\ncases, doubled in ten years. In one of the recent discussions in this\r\nHouse, upon the currency, the noble Marquis opposite (the Marquis of\r\nLansdowne) very truly remarked,--that a large quantity of currency might\r\nbe found in a country in which there should be little riches and\r\nprosperity; and that the facility and rapidity of the circulation of the\r\ncurrency were signs of the prosperity of a country, rather than the\r\nquantity of that currency. I entirely concur in the truth and justice of\r\nthis observation. But I would beg to ask the noble Marquis whether it is\r\npossible that transactions can increase and multiply as they have done\r\nin this country, in the last few years, without giving fresh scope for\r\nthe circulation of the currency of the country, fresh employment for\r\nlabour, and occasioning, in some degree, the augmentation of general\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\n_Feb. 25, 1850._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_Causes of Manufacturing Distress, over which Parliament can have no\r\nControl._\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that there has been, of late years, a great\r\nincrease of manufactures and manufactured produce in this country. It is\r\ntrue, that this produce has given to the manufacturer but little\r\nprofit, and that the wages of the manufacturing labourer are low; but,\r\nas I will show presently, the circumstance, equally with the cause of\r\nthe agricultural distress, is beyond legislative control.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, it is impossible to consider this branch of the subject\r\nwithout adverting likewise to the state of the commerce of the country.\r\nThe produce of the manufactures of the country is greater than the\r\ncountry can consume; and, consequently, the price and the reward of the\r\nlabourer must depend upon the foreign demand, as well as upon the demand\r\nat home.\r\n\r\nIn respect to the distress felt by manufacturing labourers, there can be\r\nno doubt that the wages of manual labour have been lowered by the\r\nsuccessful application of steam to the movement of machinery for the\r\npurpose of manufacture. Here, my Lords, is a cause of distress over\r\nwhich the Legislature has no practical control. As I go further in my\r\nobservations upon the speech of the Noble Earl (Stanhope) who made the\r\nmotion,[12] I will point out other causes of distress equally beyond the\r\ncontrol of the Legislature.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: For an inquiry into the state of the nation.]\r\n\r\nMy Lords, let me beg to call to the recollection of the House the state\r\nin which the world was at the end of the war in the years 1814 and 1815.\r\nEurope was absolutely overrun with armies, and had been so for about\r\ntwenty years. There was absolutely nothing but armies in the world, and\r\nnothing was thought of but the means of sustaining them. Except in\r\nFrance and this country, there were but few manufacturers in Europe; but\r\nwhen the peace took place, all the world became manufacturers. I have\r\nalready stated, that the country manufacturing more than it consumes, is\r\nunder the necessity of resorting to foreign countries, and foreign\r\nmarkets with its produce, where this produce necessarily comes in\r\ncompetition with the manufactured produce of foreign countries, brought\r\nthere by cheaper labour, and by machinery worked by steam. The prices in\r\nthose foreign countries, of necessity, govern the prices in this\r\ncountry. Here again is a cause of the existing distress, over which it\r\nwill be admitted, that the Legislature can have no control. Nothing that\r\nit is in our power to do, will raise prices abroad; and till these\r\nprices shall be raised, the prices of our produce must continue low, and\r\nprofits and wages must be low likewise.\r\n\r\nBut, my Lords, low as the prices of our produce are, compared with those\r\nof former years, those of other countries have fallen in a still greater\r\nproportion. My Lords, I will read, from a paper I hold in my hand, a few\r\nextracts of prices in different parts of the country, since the peace of\r\n1814. Raw cotton in England, in 1814 and 1815, sold at 2s. 2d. the\r\npound, or with duty included at 2s. 4d. In 1816 and 1817 it sold at 1s.\r\n8d1/2., and in 1829, at 6d. This was a fall in price greater than had\r\ntaken place in any other article. Silk, in 1814, sold for 1l. 4s., or\r\nwith duty included, 1l. 9s.; whilst in 1829 it sold for 8s. 10d., or\r\nwith the duty, 8s. 11d. the pound. Spanish wool, in 1814, sold for 8s.\r\n2d., or with the duty, at 8s. 3d.; whilst in 1829 it sold for only 2s.\r\n3d., or with the duty at 2s. 4d. Another article, that of fir-timber,\r\nfell in proportion. It was then 3l. 14s. 11d. the load, and with the\r\nduty, 10l. 5s.; it is now 2l. 5s., and with the duty, 4l. 19s. This fall\r\nin the price of foreign produce, and in our domestic manufactures, added\r\nto the advantage which the master manufacturers derived from the use of\r\nmachinery moved by steam, and from the lowness of wages, have given them\r\na greater advantage; and have enabled them to make a profit,\r\nnotwithstanding the fall of prices of the produce of their manufactures\r\nsince the war.\r\n\r\nOn articles of manufacture the prices are still lower than those of corn\r\nand other agricultural produce. Cotton yarn, which sold for 4s. 4-1/2d.\r\nthe pound in 1814, in 1830 sells for 1s. 5-1/2d.; and cotton\r\nmanufactured goods have altered in price within the same period from 1s.\r\n5d. to 1s. 8d. and 2s. 0-1/2d., to 6-1/4d., 8-3/4d., and 8-1/2d., or\r\nnearly a third. Irish linens have fallen from 1s. 7d. to 1s. 0-3/4d.;\r\nwoollen cloths in the same proportion. Other articles have been reduced\r\nenormously in price by the competition with foreigners. In those\r\narticles in which there is no competition with foreigners, prices have\r\nbeen reduced, but not in the same proportion; such, for instance, as in\r\nthe iron, the pottery, and other trades. Here, then, are causes\r\nevidently beyond the control of Parliament. Parliament cannot raise the\r\nprice of manufactured goods--the thing is impossible.\r\n\r\n_February 25, 1830._\r\n\r\n_Principle of Reduction in the Public Service._\r\n\r\nWhen offices become vacant, the Government always consider whether the\r\npublic service could not go on without their being filled up; the next\r\npoint is, to consider whether the place could not be filled up by some\r\npersons who already receive half-pay or pensions, so that the half-pay\r\nor pension might be saved to the public. We have tried to reduce the\r\nlist of pensions of the army and navy, by keeping men in the service the\r\nfull time they ought to serve, according to the original institutions of\r\nthe army. I should deceive the House by saying that savings could be\r\nbeneficial if made at the expense of individuals who must be thrown on\r\nthe public as soon as they were made.\r\n\r\n_February 23, 1830._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Corn Law of 1828 worked well._\r\n\r\nThe measure of 1828 has worked well to promote the objects which the\r\nLegislature had in view in passing it, by preventing the price of corn\r\nfrom rising so high in a season of scarcity as to be injurious to the\r\ncountry at large, and particularly to that part of the population\r\nengaged in manufacture; whilst, both in that season and the season which\r\nfollowed, the price has been sufficient to give the agriculturist a\r\nfair value for his commodity. In the second year of the existence of\r\nthat law, a greater import of corn took place than ever, to the extent\r\nof 5,000,000 of quarters, of which 2,500,000 were from Ireland, and the\r\nprices have not been lowered in this country, beyond what is deemed a\r\nremunerating price to the agriculturists. With reference to another\r\nbranch of Agriculture, I have means of proving that the prices received\r\nfor other articles of agricultural produce, such as meat, timber, &c.\r\nare equal to what they were in times when the country paid a very large\r\namount of taxes, and the Bank Restriction Act was in force.\r\n\r\n_Feb. 26, 1830._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI am convinced the corn laws cannot be repealed without injury to the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n_Feb. 25, 1830._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_Establishments necessary to maintain the National Honour._\r\n\r\nIt is perfectly true, that this island is but a small portion of the\r\nglobe, yet its interests are extended over all the world, and must be\r\nmaintained, though at a great expense. Now the expense necessary for the\r\nmaintenance of the honour and interests of this country (and over that\r\nalone have we any control), is at present only 12,000,000 l. of money;\r\nfor there has been a decrease, in the present and last sessions of\r\nParliament of not less than 2,000,000 l. on this part of the\r\nexpenditure; and your Lordships must know that there are other portions\r\nof the national expenditure, which cannot be touched at all. With\r\nrespect to that part which cannot be touched, his Majesty's Government\r\nhave effected all that they possibly could. Having said this, I must\r\nclaim for myself and my colleagues in office, credit for an anxious\r\ndesire to do everything in our power to diminish the expenditure. With\r\nrespect to the amount of expenses incurred on account of our Colonies, I\r\nbelieve that the number of troops in the old colonies and places\r\noccupied by a military force previously to 1792, is now reduced lower\r\nthan it was in that year. This country, however, in the course of the\r\nlast war, made very considerable conquests; those conquests require for\r\ntheir maintenance large bodies of men, and, consequently, create a great\r\nadditional expense. They require for their protection very nearly as\r\nmany troops as the old colonies. Before the war we were not masters of\r\nthe Cape of Good Hope, of the Mauritius, or of Ceylon. In the\r\nMediterranean, we had no station, unless Gibraltar can be deemed one,\r\nwhich is not the case now. My Lords, it is obvious, that all the new\r\nstations which we have acquired, demand a larger force for their\r\nprotection. These things considered, it appears to me, that the military\r\nestablishment has been reduced as far as it can be reduced, a proper\r\nregard being had to the interests of the empire.\r\n\r\n_March 4, 1830._\r\n\r\n_Difficulty of Legislating on the Poor Laws._\r\n\r\nIt should be recollected that some of the greatest men that ever lived\r\nin England--including Mr. Pitt and Mr. Whitbread--attempted to deal with\r\nthe difficult subject of the poor laws, and failed. It is a subject\r\nequally important, difficult, and complicated. The system, as far as\r\nlocal practice and arrangements go, varies in almost every parish of\r\nEngland more or less; and, I repeat, it is almost impossible to deal\r\nwith it successfully. We ought not to enter into the subject of the poor\r\nlaws hastily, or at an inopportune period like the present. It will be\r\nbetter to wait till the country is restored to a state of complete\r\nprosperity, and then investigate the subject with a proper degree of\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n_March 18, 1830._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The Home Market is the best._\r\n\r\nThe greatest difficulty is experienced by our manufacturers in exporting\r\ntheir manufactures. In some countries there is a total prohibition of\r\nthem; in others there is an extremely high duty; and in all there is\r\nmuch competition and jealousy. The Government, in every one of those\r\nforeign countries, seems to do everything in its power to prevent the\r\nsale of British manufactures. I am convinced, if we went to the\r\nContinent, and purchased all the corn in Poland, not an additional\r\narticle should we be able to force into France, Germany, Prussia, or\r\nRussia, If the merchants of this country were allowed freely to purchase\r\ngrain, foreign subjects would get as much for their corn as they\r\npossibly could; but their rulers would not allow a single article of our\r\nmanufactures to be imported in consequence of our being obliged to buy,\r\nor in return for our buying the grain of those countries. There is,\r\nundoubtedly, a certain quantity of manufactures in this country more\r\nthan the population itself can consume, which it would be very desirable\r\nto get rid of. But, my Lords, is it exactly true, that taking foreign\r\ncorn would have the effect of enabling other countries to purchase them?\r\nAnd even if such were the case, what are we to do with our own corn?\r\n\r\nNow, my Lords, if the buying corn of the Pole, the Russian, or the\r\nPrussian, enable them to give high prices for our manufactures, why do\r\nnot you give the same advantages to those nearer home? For my own part,\r\nI believe, after all, that the home market is our best resource, and\r\nthat there we dispose of the greatest proportion of our manufactured\r\narticles. It has, and I think with truth, been stated, that two-thirds\r\nof the whole quantity of our manufactures are disposed of in this\r\ncountry. The whole of our woollen and the whole of our silk manufactures\r\nare consumed here; and of iron and other manufactures, a very\r\nconsiderable portion. I ask, then, if such profits are to be derived\r\nfrom an exchange with a foreign market, why do you not cultivate the\r\nhome, which is admitted to be decidedly the best market of all. I think\r\nthe more this matter is discussed, the more will the country see that\r\nthe interests of one class of the community involve the interests of\r\nall. We are not to look merely to the interests of the cotton\r\nmanufacturers, or of the iron manufacturers. That which we are bound to\r\nconsider is the benefit of all; and, in my opinion, the common good will\r\nbe most effectually secured, by getting the greatest quantity of\r\nprovisions for the whole community,--by giving a proper remuneration to\r\nthose who produce such provisions,--and thus encouraging them to do that\r\nwhich is most beneficial to the community at large.\r\n\r\n_March 29, 1830._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_How far the principle of Equitable Adjustment should be carried._\r\n\r\nThe noble Lord (Viscount Goderich), speaking with his usual candour on\r\nthe subject of the equitable adjustment, admitted the existence of an\r\nincrease of price during some years of the war generally, and\r\nconsequently of public expense and of debt, to the amount of 20 per\r\ncent, in consequence of the depreciation of the currency; and he has\r\nmade a calculation of a supposed equitable adjustment, founded upon his\r\nestimate of the expense of the war for some years, and of the debt\r\ncreated by the excess of price. It is true that there was a very large\r\nincrease of prices in England during the war; that this increase of\r\nprices increased the expense of the war; and the amount of debt\r\nsuccessively raised. But it is not true that the excess of prices was\r\noccasioned solely by the paper currency. Many other circumstances\r\noccasioned it; and in my opinion, my noble friend has admitted too much\r\nin admitting that the annual payment on account of the debt has been\r\nincreased to the amount of 3,500,000 l. in consequence of the paper money\r\ncirculated during the war.\r\n\r\nHaving frequently heard of an equitable adjustment, which, however, is\r\nabsolutely impracticable as a measure to be applied solely to the\r\nnational creditor, it has always appeared to me, that such an\r\narrangement could be calculated only on the foundation of the difference\r\nbetween the currency, or the market price of gold, and the mint price of\r\ngold, at the period at which the Bank restriction was repealed, or in\r\nthe year 1812. That difference was at that period about 4 per cent; or\r\nthe difference between 3l. 17s. 10-1/2d., and 4l. 1s. The annual payment\r\non account of the debt at that time, amounted to about 30,000,000 l.\r\nsterling; upon which what is called an equitable adjustment might, at\r\nthat time, have been made to the amount of 5 per cent., or 1,200,000 l.\r\nIn making this supposed equitable adjustment, we should have betrayed\r\nthe honour of the country; we should have destroyed its credit and\r\nreputation for fair dealing, justice, and honesty; and, for this paltry\r\ndiminution of the annual expense of the debt in 1819, we should have\r\nlost the advantages since acquired, as detailed to the House by my noble\r\nfriend, amounting to a diminution of the annual charge of the debt, not\r\nof 1,200,000 l., but nearly of 5,500,000 l. or the interest of\r\n150,000,000 l. of capital at 3 per cent. This is a fair calculation of\r\nthe comparative advantage of what has been done, and what might have\r\nbeen done, by a supposed equitable adjustment.\r\n\r\n_May 6th, 1830._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The Shipping Interest has not been Neglected._\r\n\r\nThese reciprocity treaties were adopted with a view to decrease the\r\nprice of freight in this country to our merchants, and with a view to\r\ntheir taking in abroad, and bringing home, their commodities at a\r\ncheaper cost of transit. These treaties were, my Lords, framed with a\r\nforesight of the state of commerce which was likely to ensue in the\r\nworld in future times which were then immediately before us. We were,\r\ntherefore, to diminish the expense of shipping to meet the new\r\ncontingencies; and to enable those engaged in commerce to carry on their\r\ntrade under all the difficulties of a new situation; and the object of\r\nthose laws was to lower the price of commodities for that purpose. What\r\nwas the result?--profits upon specific articles became reduced; but\r\nsince the year 1814 the trade in them has nearly doubled. What the\r\nshipping interest then lost in the reduced amount of freight per\r\ntonnage, they regained in the greater number of voyages which commerce\r\nopened to them.\r\n\r\n_May 13th, 1830._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Eulogium on George IV._\r\n\r\nMy lords, our late Sovereign received the best education which this\r\ncountry affords. He had, also, the singular advantage of having passed\r\nall the earlier period of his life, and the greater part of his manhood,\r\nunder the superintendence of the King, his father, and subsequently in\r\nthe society of the most eminent men whom this country possessed; and he\r\nlikewise enjoyed the society of the most distinguished foreigners who\r\nresorted to this country. His Majesty's manners accordingly received a\r\npolish, his understanding acquired a degree of cultivation, almost\r\nunknown in any other individual. My Lords, he carried those advantages\r\nto the Government to which he was afterwards called, first as a Regent,\r\nand afterwards as reigning sovereign. During the whole course of his\r\ngovernment no man ever approached him without having evidence of his\r\ndignity, his condescension, his affability, and his fitness for the\r\nexalted station which he occupied. But these advantages, which shewed so\r\nconspicuously the polish of manner which he possessed, were not only\r\nobserved by persons immediately around him, for I appeal to many of your\r\nLordships who have transacted the business of the country which required\r\nan interview with the sovereign, whether his Majesty did not upon every\r\noccasion display a degree of knowledge and talent not to be expected of\r\nan individual holding his high station, and a profound acquaintance with\r\npublic business even in its most minute details. But this is not all, he\r\nwas a most munificent patron of the arts in this country and the whole\r\nworld. He possessed a larger collection of the eminent productions of\r\nhis own country's artists, than any individual, and it is as an\r\nindividual, of him I here speak. The taste and judgment he displayed in\r\nthese collections have never been excelled by any sovereign.\r\n\r\nI would also beg to call to your Lordships' recollection the situation\r\nin which he found England and Europe in the year 1810, when he became\r\nRegent, and the situation in which he has left Europe and this country.\r\nIf your Lordships look upon the great and stirring events of his reign,\r\nunder what circumstances it commenced and terminated, I think you will\r\nagree with me in the sentiment, that we have reason to feel proud of\r\nsuch a sovereign.\r\n\r\n_June 29th, 1830_\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Principle of advances of Money for Public Works._\r\n\r\n\r\nA noble Lord has cited an opinion of mine with respect to the advance of\r\nmoney for public works; to the principle laid down in the letter to\r\nwhich he alludes, I still adhere,--that no money should be advanced as a\r\ngrant, for works of that description, even though they may be very\r\nuseful; but, my Lords, I repeat, that there is a great distinction\r\nbetween on advance of money and a loan. The application of the\r\nproprietors of the Thames Tunnel, was for an advance of money, and not a\r\nloan; the parties, there, were not in a condition to pay the interest\r\neven of the money to be advanced, and therefore the application was\r\nrefused, but my Lords, in the present case the money is advanced on the\r\nsecurity of the tolls payable on a canal; yet even on that ground it\r\nwould not be advanced, unless it were shown that the work will be of\r\nadvantage not only to the province, but to the empire at large.\r\n\r\n_July 2nd, 1830_\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Declaration against Parliamentary Reform._\r\n\r\nI now come to another point touched upon in his Majesty's speech, from\r\nwhich, as well as the allusions to it to-night, I have experienced\r\nconsiderable pain; I allude to the state of the public mind in Kent.\r\nUpon this point I cannot help agreeing in what fell from the noble\r\nMarquis, (Camden) the Lord Lieutenant of that county, who spoke early in\r\nthe evening, namely,--that it is not to be exactly attributed to the\r\ndistress prevailing there. It certainly does appear, from all I have\r\nheard, that the outrages are carried on by two different sets of people;\r\none of which attack machinery, which they think interferes with their\r\nlabour; and the other of which are engaged in burning and destroying\r\nproperty. What the immediate cause of these disturbances is, the\r\ngovernment know no more than the magistrates and gentlemen of the\r\ncounty. We shall do all in our power in concert with these magistrates,\r\nand the Lord Lieutenant, to discover it; and, in the mean time, we shall\r\nafford them aid to put the law in force in order to prevent them.\r\n\r\nThis brings me to the recommendation which the noble Earl (Grey) has\r\nmade, not only to put down these disturbances, but to put the country in\r\na state to meet and overcome the dangers which are likely to result from\r\nthe late transactions in France, namely,--the adoption of something in\r\nthe nature of parliamentary reform. The noble Earl has stated that he is\r\nnot prepared, himself, to come forward with any measure of the kind; and\r\nI will tell him that neither is the government. Nay, I will go farther,\r\nand say, that I have not heard of any measure, up to this moment, which\r\ncould in any degree satisfy my mind, or by which the state of the\r\nrepresentation could be improved or placed on a footing more\r\nsatisfactory to the people of this country than it now is.\r\n\r\nI will not now enter upon the discussion of this subject, as I dare say\r\nwe shall have plenty of opportunities for doing so; but I will say, that\r\nI am thoroughly convinced that England possesses, at this moment, a\r\nlegislature which answers all the good purposes of a legislature, in a\r\nhigher degree than any scheme of government that ever has been found to\r\nanswer in any country in the world;--that it possesses the confidence of\r\nthe country--that it deservedly possesses that confidence--and that its\r\ndecisions have justly the greatest weight and influence with the people.\r\nNay, my Lords, I will go yet farther and say, that if, at this moment, I\r\nhad to form a legislature for any country, particularly for one like\r\nthis, in possession of great property of various descriptions, although,\r\nperhaps, I should not form one precisely such as we have, I would\r\nendeavour to produce something which would give the same\r\nresults--namely, a representation of the people, containing a large body\r\nof the property of the country, and in which the great landed\r\nproprietors have a preponderating influence.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion I beg to state, that not only is the government not\r\nprepared to bring forward any measure of this description, but that as\r\nfar as I am concerned, whilst I have the honour to hold the situation I\r\nnow do amongst his Majesty's councillors, I shall always feel it my duty\r\nto oppose any such measures when brought forward by others.\r\n\r\n_November 2, 1830._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Irish Absenteeism deprecated._\r\n\r\nI can assure your Lordships that there is not any man, either there or\r\nhere, who is more aware of the poverty of Ireland, and the dangers to\r\nthe empire from the state of the lower orders, than he who has now the\r\nhonour of addressing you. But I would have noble Lords to observe that\r\nit is not by coming here to talk of the poverty of that country that we\r\ncan remove it. If noble Lords will endeavour to tranquilize the country,\r\nand persuade those who have the means to buy estates and settle there;\r\nby holding out to them a picture of industry and tranquility with its\r\nother advantages, they will soon find the country change its aspect, and\r\ncomplaints of the dangers arising from its poverty will no longer be\r\nheard. The influence of the presence and fortunes of the proprietors of\r\nland in Ireland spent in that country, would do more to serve it than\r\nany legislative enactment parliament have it in their power to pass.\r\n\r\n_November 2, 1830._\r\n\r\n_Repeal averted by Emancipation._\r\n\r\nThe repeal of the union is opposed by the noble Duke opposite (the Duke\r\nof Leinster) and all his friends in Ireland: it is opposed by all the\r\nproprietors in Ireland, by the great majority of the Roman Catholics, by\r\nnearly all the Protestants of Ireland, and with one exception by the\r\nunanimous voice of the other House of Parliament.\r\n\r\nSuch is the present state of this question, but how would it have stood\r\nhad not that other to which he alluded been carried two years ago? And\r\nhow did that one then stand? Why, the noble Duke and all his friends,\r\nand a large proportion of the Irish people, were anxious that that\r\nquestion should be carried. Such, also, do we know to a certainty was\r\nthe desire of the majority of the other House of Parliament, whilst at\r\nthe same time there was in this House a minority in its favour, daily\r\nacquiring greater strength; and at present, I presume, no one will deny\r\nthat a large body of the best informed people of this country were also\r\ndecidedly for conceding this point. We do not now stand on worse ground\r\non the question of the repeal of the union than we should have done had\r\nnot the Catholic question been carried. I do not see the advantage,\r\ntherefore, of repeating reproaches against me for having given way on\r\nthat occasion from fear. I gave way because I conceived the interests of\r\nthe country would be best answered by doing so; I gave way on the\r\ngrounds of policy and expediency, and upon those grounds I am at this\r\nmoment ready to justify what I did. The noble Lord must forgive me for\r\nsaying that the state of irritation which has continued to exist in\r\nIreland since that question was carried must not be attributed to the\r\nKing's Ministers: they have done every thing in their power to\r\nconciliate, and heal the divisions which distracted that country for so\r\nmany years previously to the settlement of that question. It is not my\r\nduty, any more than my inclination, to cast imputation on any man; but\r\nthis I will say, that if the King's Ministers had been supported as\r\nstrongly as they have been opposed in their endeavours to heal those\r\ndivisions, Ireland would have been in a very different state from what\r\nit now is.\r\n\r\n_November 2, 1830._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Magistrates should be appointed by Lords Lieutenant._\r\n\r\nLords Lieutenant of counties are generally chosen in consequence of\r\ntheir possessing large properties, and from their weight and\r\nconsideration in the counties over which they preside. They must,\r\ntherefore, be the most highly interested in selecting proper persons,\r\nand a proper number of persons, whom they know will do their duty well\r\nas magistrates.\r\n\r\nIn choosing magistrates, in my opinion, it is essentially necessary that\r\nlocal knowledge should operate. Before any man should venture to\r\nrecommend another to be appointed to the commission, he should have\r\nknowledge of his character, and of other circumstances, which can only\r\nbe discerned by local knowledge.\r\n\r\n_Nov. 29, 1830._\r\n\r\n_The Agrarian Outrages of 1830._\r\n\r\nIt appears to me that the outrages which have taken place in the country\r\nare of two descriptions--the first is that open description of outrage,\r\nwhich there is no doubt, may be got the better of by the operation of\r\nthe ordinary process of law; the second is that description of\r\ncrime--the destruction of property by fire,--of the perpetrators of\r\nwhich Government have not hitherto been able to discover any trace\r\nwhatever. I do not know what information the Noble Earl may have\r\nreceived on the subject within the last week, but up to that period we\r\nhad discovered no traces whatever of these incendiaries.\r\n\r\nIt is supposed by some noble Lords, that the perpetrators of the second\r\ndescription of crime--the destruction of property by fire--are\r\nforeigners, and that they are following the example set in another\r\ncountry. I believe, however, there is no evidence whatever that\r\nforeigners have been engaged in the perpetration of those crimes. It is\r\ncertain that they have been effected by a conspiracy of some kind or\r\nother; but whether the conspirators are foreigners or Englishmen, I\r\nbelieve that no man can at this moment possibly say. As to foreigners\r\nbeing in gaols, I can only say, that with reference to one county--the\r\ncounty of Hants--in which outrages of the most flagrant kind have\r\noccurred, there is not one foreigner among the persons with whom\r\nWinchester gaol is filled.\r\n\r\n_Nov. 29, 1830._\r\n\r\n_Our Portuguese Relations affected by the State of Ireland._\r\n\r\nIn reference to Ireland, it is of great importance that we should be on\r\ngood terms with Portugal. Unfortunately, the great measure which I had\r\nthe honour to prepare three years ago, has not answered so as to\r\nproduce--I will not say all the advantages I expected from it, as I was\r\nnever sanguine in my expectations, but the amount of advantage which\r\nsome of your Lordships and part of the public expected. To use a vulgar\r\nexpression, a new hare has started, and we must probably look to a\r\nlength of time ere the agitation excited in Ireland by the new question\r\nshall have subsided. Now, I want to know, whether Portugal will not be\r\nas important to us during the agitation of that question as it has been\r\npreviously? Will not our reception in the Tagus, and friendly occupation\r\nof it, be as important to England now, as it has been heretofore? I do\r\nnot now wish to discuss the claims of Don Miguel and Donna Maria--this\r\nis not the occasion for it--I only mean to convey my decided opinion,\r\nthat the friendship of Portugal is necessary to this country. If we\r\ndeprive Portugal of the advantages of this wine trade for a revenue of\r\n100,000 l., putting political economy and commerce out of the question,\r\nwe shall make the greatest political blunder that has been seen for a\r\nlong time past.\r\n\r\n_Feb. 21, 1831._\r\n\r\n_How is the Government to be carried on after the Reform Bill?_\r\n\r\nWith respect to another subject (Reform) which must occasion discussion,\r\nI quite agree in the determination which has been adopted of postponing\r\nall discussions upon it till a future period; but when that period shall\r\narrive, I hope that his Majesty's ministers, who, upon their own\r\nresponsibility, have brought the question under discussion, will be so\r\nkind as to explain to the House in what manner, and by what influence,\r\nthey propose that the Government of this country--the Monarchical\r\nGovernment of this country--shall be carried on, according to the\r\nprinciples and practice established at the Revolution.\r\n\r\n_March 3, 1831._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The Downfall of the Constitution predicted as the Consequence of the\r\nReform Bill._\r\n\r\nIt is far from my wish to impute to the noble Earl (Grey) or his\r\ncolleagues any desire to introduce revolutionary measures into\r\nParliament; but, I must say this, that having looked at the measure\r\nwhich has been brought into the other House of Parliament under their\r\nauspices, I cannot but consider that it alters every interest existing\r\nin the country,--that in consequence of its operation, no interest will\r\nremain on the footing on which it now stands, and that this alteration\r\nmust lead to a total alteration of men--of men intrusted with the\r\nconfidence of Parliament. I am of opinion that this alteration must have\r\na serious effect on the public interests,--an effect which, I confess, I\r\ncannot look at without the most serious apprehension. I do not charge\r\nthe noble Earl and his colleagues with a desire to overturn the\r\ninstitutions of the country, but I cannot look at the alterations\r\nproposed by the bill without seeing that those alterations must be\r\nfollowed by a total change of men, and likewise by a total change of the\r\nwhole system of Government. Why, I ask--for what reason--is all this to\r\nbe done? I will not now enter into the question of what is the opinion\r\nof the other House of Parliament--but I will say again, as I have said\r\nbefore, in the presence of your Lordships, that I see no reason whatever\r\nfor altering the constitution of Parliament.\r\n\r\nIt is my opinion that parliament has well served the country, and that\r\nit deserves the thanks of the country for a variety of measures which it\r\nhas proposed, particularly of late years. I see no reason for the\r\nmeasure now proposed, except that stated by the noble Earl--namely, his\r\ndesire to gratify certain individuals in the country. It is possible\r\nthat a large number, nay, even a majority of individuals, in this\r\ncountry may be desirous of this change, but I see no reason, excepting\r\nthat, for this measure being introduced or adopted.\r\n\r\nWhilst I thus declare my sentiments, I beg your Lordships to believe\r\nthat I feel no interest in this question, excepting that which I have in\r\ncommon with every individual in the country. I possess no influence or\r\ninterest of the description which will be betrayed by the measure now\r\nproposed. I am an individual who has served his Majesty for now, I am\r\nsorry to say, nearly half a century; I have been in his Majesty's\r\nservice for forty-five years--for thirty eventful years of that period I\r\nhave served his Majesty in situations of trust and confidence, in the\r\ncommand of his armies, in embassies, and in his councils; and the\r\nexperience which I have acquired in the situations in which I have\r\nserved his Majesty, enables me, and imposes upon me the duty, to say,\r\nthat I cannot look at this measure without the most serious\r\napprehensions, that from the period of its adoption, we shall date the\r\ndownfall of the constitution.\r\n\r\n_March 24, 1831._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Under the Reformed System, how is the King's Government to be carried\r\non?_\r\n\r\nI have, myself, examined the bill, with reference to its effects on the\r\ncounty of Southampton. In that county there are several\r\ntowns--Winchester, Christchurch, Portsmouth, Southampton, and the\r\nborough of Lymington. Several boroughs in that county are struck out of\r\nthe representation by the bill, and there are, besides, a vast number of\r\nconsiderable towns left unrepresented, but the voters of these places\r\nare to come into the county constituency. According to the old system,\r\nthe voters of the towns had votes for the county; now, copyholders and\r\n50l. householders are to vote for the county. In the towns, these two\r\nclasses are, for the most part, shopkeepers.\r\n\r\nI am convinced that there are no less than 4000 or 5000 such inhabitants\r\nof towns in Hampshire, who will have votes for the county, as well as\r\nthe freeholders. Now, of whom does this class of electors consist? As I\r\nbefore stated, they are shopkeepers--respectable shopkeepers--in the\r\ntowns. I beg to ask, are they fit persons to be the only electors to\r\nreturn county members to a Parliament, which Parliament is to govern the\r\naffairs of this great nation, consisting of 100,000,000 of subjects, and\r\nso many various relations, foreign, domestic, colonial, commercial, and\r\nmanufacturing? Men of the description I have mentioned, with their\r\nprejudices and peculiar interests, however respectable as a body, cannot\r\nbe fit to be the only electors of members of the House of Commons. But,\r\nI beg to say that, however respectable this, or any other class of\r\nelectors may be, there is a strong reason against any uniformity of\r\nsystem in the representation of the country. I have heard already of the\r\nestablishment, in this town, of a committee formed for the purpose of\r\nrecommending candidates for the representation to the different towns\r\nthroughout the country. I confess, I do not believe that this committee\r\nhas been established more than a few days; but I beg to say that, taking\r\ninto consideration the means of combinations, and the facilities of\r\ncommunications in the country, such a body is dangerous. I know that\r\nsuch committees, in other countries, have been found to be effectual in\r\nputting down the Government. And I ask whether you should allow such a\r\nuniform system of election--it matters not in whose hands it is\r\nplaced--that a committee, sitting in London, shall have the power to\r\ndictate what members shall be returned for Leeds, or for Manchester, for\r\ninstance? I wish to know what security noble Lords have for their seats\r\nin this House, if such a committee as this should exist at the first\r\ngeneral election of a reformed Parliament? But, my Lords, these are not\r\nall the objections which I entertain to this measure; I have others,\r\nfounded upon facts, which I know to have existed in other countries. I\r\nwas in France when the law of election was passed, in the year 1817; and\r\nthis circumstance deserves your Lordships' attention, because the\r\nsituation of the two countries is not dissimilar. At that period there\r\nwere, in each department 300 persons, who, paying the highest amount of\r\ntaxes, were chosen to manage the representation. The King and Government\r\naltered this, and gave the power of choosing representatives to persons\r\npaying taxes to the amount of 300 francs. Two years afterwards, they\r\nwere obliged to alter the law again, and form two classes of electors.\r\nSince then, there have been two general elections, one more unfavourable\r\nthan the other to the Government; and the matter ended in the formation\r\nof a Parliament, the spirit of which rendered it impossible for a\r\nGovernment to act.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, I do not mean here to justify the Government of Charles X.;\r\nand I trust the noble and learned Lord (Lord Brougham) will allow me, on\r\nthis occasion, to declare that I never wrote to Prince Polignac in my\r\nlife (much as I have been accused of encouraging the proceedings of that\r\nperson), and I have never written to Charles X. from the time that\r\nmonarch lost his son, and his grandson was born. In fact, I have never\r\ncorresponded with any French minister without the knowledge of my\r\ncolleagues. The noble and learned Lord on the woolsack may rely on it,\r\nthat I had no more knowledge of Prince Polignac's proceedings, than the\r\nnoble and learned Lord himself; or, most probably, still less. I am not\r\nthe apologist of Prince Polignac; but, I say, that things had been\r\nbrought to that state in France, that it was impossible but there should\r\nbe a revolution.\r\n\r\nWhen I see a similar mode of election established in this country--when\r\nI see the adoption of a uniform system of election--when I see the\r\nelection placed in the hands of shopkeepers in boroughs all over the\r\ncountry--I think that we incur considerable danger, and put the country\r\nin such a situation as that no minister can be certain that any one\r\nmeasure which he brings forward will succeed, or that he will he enabled\r\nto carry on the Government. The circumstances of France and England are,\r\nin many particulars, alike, and we ought to take warning by the dangers\r\nof the neighbouring country.\r\n\r\nI wish the House to advert to what the business of the King's Government\r\nin Parliament is. It is the duty of that Government to manage\r\neverything. I heard the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack, in a\r\nspeech of admirable eloquence and knowledge, propose a new judicial\r\nsystem at the commencement of the Session; but I tell him, that it is\r\nimpossible for the Government ultimately to decide on that question; and\r\nthat if a Parliament be constructed on the new plan, it will be too\r\nstrong for Government on that question. So, also, in matters affecting\r\ncommerce and manufactures, Government would depend entirely upon\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\nI want to hear how Government is to carry any measure, on the\r\nappointment of a new Parliament? There is a great question now before\r\nthe House of Commons on the subject of tithes. How is any Government to\r\nmeet that question? A Government may submit to the will of a majority\r\nopposed to its own view on other questions, but on the question of\r\ntithes and the Church, the duty of any Government is clearly pointed\r\nout--the King's Coronation Oath, and the Acts of Union with Scotland and\r\nIreland, guaranteeing the integrity of the Church Establishment, and the\r\nprotection of the estates and prosperity of the Church. But I want to\r\nknow how Government is to maintain the safety of the Established Church,\r\nafter placing Parliament on the footing proposed. I really do not wish\r\nto carry this argument farther than it will go; but, looking round, and\r\nconsidering the operation of the proposed measure in towns, as well as\r\nin counties, and forming the best judgment I can on affairs so\r\ncomplicated, I must infer, from every thing I see, that the\r\nConstitution of the country cannot be carried on as hitherto, if this\r\nplan be adopted. In such an event, you would alter your whole system of\r\nGovernment. I do not say the Crown cannot last. You may still permit the\r\nKing's interference in the management of the army, the navy, and the\r\nordnance; and the rest of the Government may he carried on by the House\r\nof Commons. Things may go on under such a system; but this will not be\r\nthe British Constitution. It will not be the same England, which has\r\nbeen, for so many centuries, prosperous and glorious under our present\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\n_March 28, 1831._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The Unreformed House a complete Legislative Body._\r\n\r\nAs to the present House of Commons, I maintain that it is as complete a\r\nlegislative body as can be required; and that the House of Commons,\r\nsince the peace particularly, has shown itself to be the most efficient\r\nlegislative body that ever existed in any country in the world, not\r\nexcepting this. I say, that it has rendered more services than any\r\nLegislature ever did in the same period--I say, it has continued those\r\ngreat services up to the present moment, and that those services have\r\nonly been interrupted by the introduction of this discussion upon the\r\nReform Bill.\r\n\r\n_March 28, 1831._\r\n\r\n_Reasons why the Duke resigned Office in November, 1830._\r\n\r\nIt is quite true, that when the late Government brought forward the\r\nCatholic question, they were supported by many noble Lords who were\r\nusually opposed to the Government; but it is not correct that the\r\ndisfranchisement of the forty-shilling freeholders was made a _sine qua\r\nnon_ to ensure the support of the noble Lords to the Relief Bill. I\r\ncertainly had the misfortune, on that occasion, to lose the support and\r\nregard of a great number of friends, both here and in the other House of\r\nParliament--a misfortune I have never ceased to lament; yet I have the\r\nconsolation of knowing, that in what I then did, I did no more than what\r\nmy duty required of me; and I was not justified in relinquishing that\r\nmeasure by any intimidation, or by any imaginary circumstance of\r\ndanger--which I had no right to apprehend. But I own that things were\r\ngoing on in Ireland which induced me to think they might lead to a civil\r\nwar, in the event of our continuing to refuse the settlement of the\r\nquestion; and I am satisfied that I should have been wanting in duty,\r\nboth as a man and a Minister, if I had hesitated to give up those\r\nopinions which I had previously entertained with regard to that measure.\r\nI afterwards had some difference with a noble Earl opposite (Earl Grey),\r\nbut notwithstanding I felt called upon to retain the position I held in\r\nthe Government as long as I enjoyed the approbation of my Sovereign, and\r\nthe confidence of the Legislature.\r\n\r\nThen came the Revolution in France, followed by that of Belgium; and\r\nlike the former revolutions of Naples and of Spain, they naturally\r\nexcited a strong sensation here; that excitement, increased by speeches\r\nmade in various parts of the country, created a strong desire for\r\nParliamentary Reform. But I did not think then, any more than I think\r\nnow, that that desire was irresistible. If Parliament should see reason\r\nto decide that the proposed alteration in the Constitution is not\r\nnecessary, and ought not to be made, I am confident the country will\r\nacquiesce in that decision. I believe that the wish for reform is strong\r\nand growing; but if the people see that the subject is fairly discussed,\r\nand honestly determined here, I am sure they will submit without a\r\nmurmur. Already the sensation produced by the French and Belgian\r\nRevolutions has subsided; the natives of the country have seen the\r\ndeplorable results by which those commotions have been followed, and are\r\nwisely warned by the sufferings of their neighbours.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nUpon the defeat on the Civil List, finding I had the misfortune no\r\nlonger to enjoy the confidence of the House of Commons, I thought proper\r\nto resign the situation which I held in his Majesty's service. Upon that\r\noccasion, the question of Parliamentary Reform had no more to do, as far\r\nas I was concerned, with the resignation which I tendered to his Majesty\r\non the day following the defeat on the Civil List, than anything else\r\nin the world. I admit I resigned next morning, because I did not wish to\r\nexpose his Majesty and the country to the consequences that might result\r\nfrom the Government going out on the success of the question of\r\nParliamentary Reform. This is the truth; but, to say I resigned on\r\naccount of Parliamentary Reform, is wrong; I resigned upon the ground\r\nbefore stated; and I resigned at that particular moment on the Tuesday,\r\nbecause I did not choose to expose his Majesty and the country to the\r\nconsequences that might ensue from the occurrence of the case just\r\nmentioned. This is the real fact of the story. But the noble and learned\r\nLord has said, that the late Ministry gave up the principle of\r\nParliamentary Reform by their resignation; no such thing--we resigned\r\nbecause we did not possess the confidence of the House of Commons, and\r\nwe thought that the same majority which defeated us on Monday on the\r\nCivil List, might defeat us Tuesday on Reform; and then we should have\r\nsacrificed (as the noble Lord says), the principle of Parliamentary\r\nReform in the Commons. We did not think it worth while to make any\r\nfarther struggle in order to retain office a day or two longer.\r\n\r\n_March 28, 1831._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The Civil List principle, on what arranged._\r\n\r\nMy Lords, the principle on which I and my colleagues drew up the Civil\r\nList, was always directed to enable the Sovereign, so far as was\r\npracticable, to defray all the expenses necessary to be incurred in\r\nsupporting the dignity, splendour, and comforts of the Crown, without\r\nmixing them up with the other expenses of the Government. For this\r\npurpose, it was formerly the practice to grant a considerable sum for\r\nthose various, but necessary expenses. Certainly, the Crown enjoyed\r\ngreat advantage in supporting its dignity, influence, and efficiency, as\r\nlong as the system of supporting itself on its hereditary revenues\r\nremained in practice. That system, my Lords, was departed from at the\r\ncommencement of the reign of Geo. III.; and a further departure from it\r\nhas since taken place, into which I shall, with your Lordships'\r\npermission, examine presently, and compare that departure with those\r\nproposed by the late Government. From the accounts I have seen of the\r\nhereditary revenues enjoyed by Geo. II., I have reason to believe that\r\nwere they now enjoyed by our Sovereign, and employed in defraying the\r\ncivil expenses of the Government, and sustaining the dignity and\r\nsplendour of the Crown, they would amount to a sum larger than would be\r\nnecessary to meet those expenses, notwithstanding the increase which has\r\nbeen made in them by the increased salaries of the judges, the increased\r\nnumber of the public officers, and the vast increase of the royal family\r\nof England. I say, my Lords, that these hereditary revenues would be\r\nmore than adequate to defray all these charges. I believe that these\r\nrevenues, independent of droits and West Indian duties, amount, at the\r\npresent moment, to 850,000 l. a-year; and these revenues, my Lords, I\r\nconsider as much the King's property, as I hold the possessions of your\r\nLordships to be yours. I make this statement, because it is important\r\nthat your Lordships should recollect it, and the public should know that\r\nnotwithstanding the magnitude of the expenses of the Sovereign, the\r\nSovereign has as much right to the sum which I have mentioned, as any of\r\nyour Lordships to your own estates. The system of giving the Sovereign\r\nthe amount of certain taxes to defray the expenses of the civil\r\ngovernment, was first departed from at the commencement of the reign of\r\nGeo. III., when a fixed sum was appointed, instead of that mode of\r\npayment, for its support. In process of time the expenses of the civil\r\ngovernment increased, and the Civil List became a debt. The consequence\r\nwas, that in the year 1815, an inquiry was instituted into the\r\ncircumstances which had caused this increase of charges upon the Civil\r\nList, up to the period of the Regency. What was the course then adopted\r\nby Parliament? Why, it was to bring certain charges--as, for instance,\r\nthe charges for ambassadors and ministers abroad--under the annual vote\r\nof Parliament; and the immediate object was to avoid thereby the fixing\r\nof any fresh debt, for which no estimate could be previously made, upon\r\nthe Civil List. In 1820 it was determined that nothing whatever should\r\nbe brought before Parliament, in connexion with the Civil List, that was\r\na casual expense, or for which a regular vote could not be submitted.\r\n\r\nThe original system, I have already stated, had been departed from in\r\nthe reign of George III., and the late Government in presenting their\r\ncivil list made a still further departure from it, and upon this\r\nprinciple;--wherever a part of a salary was to be paid out of the civil\r\nlist, and part out of the consolidated fund, it was resolved to pay all\r\nout of the consolidated fund. The course was adopted with regard to the\r\nsalaries of the Judges, the Lord Chancellor, and the Speaker of the\r\nHouse of Commons, and also of various other offices, some of which have\r\nbeen since abolished. This was thought a less objectionable mode than\r\nthat of subjecting those salaries to an annual discussion in the\r\nCommittee of the House of Commons. We wished my Lords to place those\r\nsalaries upon the consolidated fund, in order to prevent the possibility\r\nof the country being left without a proper and efficient administration\r\nof public affairs. We did not wish to leave the Government to the chance\r\nof being impeded by a small majority, in the House of Commons, which,\r\naccording to other proposed plans, might diminish the salaries of public\r\nofficers at pleasure. If my Lord we look to the period of the Revolution\r\nwe shall find that there were long discussions respecting the right of\r\nthe crown to its hereditary revenues, which ended in a concession of the\r\nprinciple that these revenues did belong to the crown. At that time\r\nnobody ever dreamed of separating the expenses of the crown from those\r\nof the civil government, and of making a separate provision for the\r\nsupport of the state and dignity of the crown, which should be subject\r\nto the controul of parliament. The plan of separation, my Lords, is one\r\nof modern invention altogether, and I totally dissent from it. Because,\r\nlet us look to the situation in which the crown is placed under the\r\noperation of such a system, and we must observe that it will place the\r\ncrown in a situation such as it ought not to be reduced to; namely that\r\nit will render it liable to be deprived of the assistance--say of a\r\npublic officer, whose salary may be lost by a single vote in a committee\r\nof supply.\r\n\r\n_April, 19th, 1831._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The Expenses of Ministers ruinous, unless they have large Private\r\nfortunes._\r\n\r\nWith respect to the reduction in the salaries of the great officers of\r\nstate, I have only to observe, that even under the existing rate of\r\nsalaries, unless a First Lord of the Treasury, (and the remark will\r\napply to the other state officers) possesses a large private fortune, he\r\nmust be ruined in consequence of the heavy expences entailed on him by\r\nhis situation, and the inadequacy of the sum allowed by the public for\r\nthe maintenance of those expenses. In proof of this, I may instance the\r\ncase of three prime ministers--Mr. Pitt, Mr. Percival, and Mr.\r\nCanning,--all of whom were almost ruined by their being in office. I\r\ntook upon myself to propose a provision for the family of Mr. Canning in\r\nconsequence.\r\n\r\n_April, 19th. 1831._\r\n\r\n_The Roman Catholic Relief Bill settled the question of the Repeal of\r\nthe Union._\r\n\r\nIt is not my intention at present to enter into the question, as to the\r\nexpediency of granting the Roman Catholic claims; for I hope that\r\nquestion is for ever set at rest. The former government of this country\r\nderived some advantage from the settlement of that question; and I\r\nbelieve that this advantage will at least be admitted to have flowed\r\nfrom it,--that now there is no question either in this or the other\r\nHouse of Parliament, or among the public, respecting the necessity or\r\nexpediency of repealing the Union. When I introduced the Catholic Relief\r\nBill, I stated that political power already existed in the hands of the\r\nRoman Catholics, and that was a statement, generally admitted by noble\r\nLords on both sides of the House. What the Bill effected was to give the\r\ncapacity of enjoying political power to the higher classes of the Roman\r\nCatholics, and to take it out of the hands of those of the lower classes\r\nwho did not exercise it themselves for their own purposes, and according\r\nto the suggestion of their own sentiments, but at the dictation of a\r\nbody among the Catholic people, who, it will be admitted by everybody,\r\nought not to possess any political power whatever,--I mean the Roman\r\nCatholic priesthood.\r\n\r\n_April, 21st. 1831._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_If the Reform Bill be passed, it will be impossible to preserve\r\ninviolate the Union with Ireland._\r\n\r\nMy opinion is, that your Lordships will find it difficult, indeed,\r\nafter having passed the Bill under discussion of the other House of\r\nParliament, to maintain inviolate that Union which now exists between\r\nthe two countries. I mean to say, that in the event of that bill\r\npassing, it would be impossible to maintain that article of the Union\r\nwhich recognises the Church of England as a branch of that Union, and\r\nwhich guarantees its safety. I beg to call to your Lordships'\r\nrecollection, that his Majesty is sworn to maintain that Union\r\ninviolate; and that, in adopting the Reform measure, the Parliament do\r\nactually expose his Majesty to the risk of consenting to a bill\r\ncalculated to break down the Church Establishment in Ireland. This is\r\nthe impression I have always entertained--and it is an impression which\r\nI cannot remove from my mind; and, I must confess, that when I heard the\r\nother night the noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack (Lord Brougham)\r\nassert that the Reform Bill had put down agitation in Ireland, on the\r\nsubject of a Repeal of the Union, I was much surprised.\r\n\r\n_April 22, 1831._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Importance of Portugal to England._\r\n\r\nThere is no country in Europe whose alliance is so important to England\r\nas Portugal; there is no country, the preservation of whose independence\r\nis so important to us, as that of Portugal.\r\n\r\n_July 26, 1831._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_A preventive Police checks Crime._\r\n\r\nIn all foreign countries there exists a preventive police,--but there\r\nis no such thing in England,--which preventive police has the effect of\r\nchecking crime in a very great degree. We have nothing of the sort in\r\nEngland, neither can there be, according to the principles of our law\r\nand constitution. Such being the case, your Lordships must use great\r\ncaution in drawing comparisons between convictions in this and foreign\r\ncountries; if that is not done, the most erroneous conclusions will be\r\narrived at.\r\n\r\n_September 6, 1831._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_A War of Opinions the worst of Wars._\r\n\r\nThe truth is, that the government of Portugal has, for the last ten\r\nmonths, been looked upon with inimical feelings and with passion by the\r\nKing's servants; and this measure[13] is not brought forward with any\r\nview to revenue, but for the purpose of opposing and embarrassing the\r\nexisting Government of that country. The noble Lords opposite do not\r\nlike the situation of the Government of Portugal; it is not to their\r\nmind; and they are anxious, either by revolutionary measures, or any\r\nother, to overthrow it. Let them, however, look well at the\r\nresponsibility they are incurring. Let them consider the frightful\r\nconsequences in which their planning may involve this country, and the\r\nwhole of Europe. If their designs even met with a temporary success,\r\nthey would inevitably lead to a war of opinion, to a war of\r\nreligion--the worst of wars, and the most deplorable consequences for\r\nall Europe would ensue.\r\n\r\n_September 30, 1831._\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: The Wine Duties Bill; for regulating the tariff as\r\nregards Portugal.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The Duke's Declaration against all Reform._\r\n\r\nBut, my Lords, if I wanted an example of the value of the House of\r\nCommons, I should find it in the opinion of the noble Earl (Grey) the\r\nlast time, I believe, the last time that he spoke of the House of\r\nCommons. In the month of February, 1817, the noble Lord said,\r\n\"constituted as it now was, he, in his conscience, believed that the\r\nHouse of Commons was, of all other institutions, in all the other\r\ncountries of the world, the institution best calculated for the general\r\nprotection of the subject. Supported by the people, in temperate and\r\nfirm claims for redress, it was not only able, but certain to remedy\r\nevery wrong. It was capable of acting as the most efficient control upon\r\nthe executive, by diminishing the means of consumption, and reducing the\r\npressure of a severe and grinding taxation.\" That was the opinion of the\r\nnoble Earl himself, in 1817; and what, I would ask, has the Parliament\r\ndone, subsequently, to deserve the disapprobation of the noble Earl?\r\nWhat had it done between 1817 and the moment when I pronounced that\r\napprobation of Parliament, of which my noble friend (Earl Winchelsea)\r\nand the noble Earl (Grey) have so much disapproved? When the noble Earl\r\nquoted what I said not quite a twelvemonth ago, he might, I think, quote\r\nit correctly. What I said was, that Parliament had done its duty by the\r\ncountry, and enjoyed its confidence. I said, that if I had to create a\r\nconstitution of Parliament, I could not create that which now existed,\r\nbecause I did not believe the art of one man could invent such a system;\r\nbut I said, that I would do my endeavour to establish one like it, in\r\nwhich property in land should be preponderant. That was what I said; and\r\nI afterwards had the satisfaction to hear the noble Marquis (Lansdowne)\r\ndeliver a similar opinion. He stated that, in any system of\r\nrepresentation which he could support, property and learning must be\r\npreponderant. I said that I should consider it my duty to resist the\r\nadopting of any plan of reform that should be brought forward. I spoke\r\nas a minister of the Crown; I meant to resist reform. The noble Lords\r\nsay, that this statement of mine caused great enmity to me, and created\r\nthat spirit of reform which has since pervaded the whole country. I beg\r\nthe noble Earl's pardon; but the spirit of reform in this country was\r\nthe consequence of the French revolution. It is true, that ever since\r\nthe American war, a desire for Parliamentary Reform has been manifested,\r\nparticularly when any disturbance or insurrection has occurred in any of\r\nthe neighbouring foreign countries--above all, since the French\r\nrevolution; and when there has been any extraordinary distress or\r\ndifficulty in the country. At the same time, I believe that, from year\r\nto year, the manifestations of such a desire have been less frequent. I\r\nhave, indeed, the authority of those most friendly to reform for saying\r\nthat the manifestations of the desire for reform were less frequent,\r\ntill the period of the revolution of July, 1830, than they had formerly\r\nbeen for a number of years.\r\n\r\n_October 4, 1831._\r\n\r\n_Electoral Pledges Unconstitutional._\r\n\r\nIt is on the ground of the dissolution, and of the Speech from the\r\nThrone,[14] that I charge the noble Lords with having excited the spirit\r\nwhich existed in the country at the period of the last general election;\r\nand with having been the cause of the unconstitutional practice,\r\nhitherto unknown, of electing delegates for a particular purpose to\r\nParliament--delegates to obey the daily instructions of their\r\nconstituents, and to be cashiered if they should disobey them, whatever\r\nmay be their own opinion; instead of being, as they have been hitherto,\r\nindependent members of Parliament, to deliberate with their colleagues\r\nupon matters of common concern, and to decide according to the best of\r\ntheir judgment, after such deliberation and debate. This is an evil of\r\nwhich the country will long feel the consequences, whatever may be the\r\nresult of these discussions.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: The Whig ministry dissolved the Parliament in April, 1831.\r\nA new Parliament met in June; and, on the 21st of that month, the King\r\nmade the speech alluded to. In the interval there had been great\r\nexcitement in the country.]\r\n\r\nMy Lords, this measure, thus delegated by the people, and thus brought\r\nforward by the Government in Parliament, for the decision of members\r\nthus delegated to give it the force of a law, alters every thing; and\r\nrequires, as the noble Secretary of State (Lord Melbourne) says, new\r\npowers, in order to render it practicable to carry on the Government at\r\nall.\r\n\r\n_October 4, 1831._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_A Democratic Assembly of the worst description will be elected under\r\nthe Reform Bill._\r\n\r\nThroughout the whole of the empire, persons of the lowest condition of\r\nlife, liable to, and even existing under, the most pernicious\r\ninfluences, are to have votes; or, in other words, are to exercise\r\npolitical power. Persons in those stations of life do exercise political\r\npower already; but, in a few places, in large masses; preponderating\r\nover the influence of other classes of society. What must we expect when\r\nthese lower classes will preponderate everywhere? We know what sort of\r\nrepresentatives are returned by the places I have described. What are we\r\nto expect, when the whole will be of the same description?\r\n\r\nWe hear, sometimes, of radical reform; and we know that the term applies\r\nto universal suffrage, vote by ballot, annual parliaments, and their\r\nconsequences. But, I declare, that looking at these changes pervading\r\nevery part of the representation, root and branch, destroying or\r\nchanging everything that has existed, even to the relative numbers of\r\nthe representatives from the three kingdoms fixed by treaty, I should\r\ncall this a radical reform, rather than reform of any other description.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI cannot but consider that the House of Commons returned by it will be a\r\ndemocratical assembly of the worst description; that radical reform,\r\nvote by ballot, and all the evil consequences to be expected from the\r\ndeliberations of such an assembly, must follow from this establishment.\r\nI entreat your Lordships to pause before you agree to establish such a\r\nsystem in your country.\r\n\r\n_October 4, 1831._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The popular Will no ground for conceding Reform._\r\n\r\nBut we are told that the people wish for this measure; and when we\r\nexpress our sense of the danger which attends it, on account of the\r\ndemocratical power which it tends to establish, an endeavour is made to\r\ncalm our apprehensions, by the assurance that the people are attached to\r\nthe Government of King, Lords, and Commons.\r\n\r\nIf we are to rely upon that feeling of the people--if we are to adopt\r\nthis measure because it is the pleasure of the people, and because they\r\nare attached to the Government of King, Lords, and Commons, why do we\r\nnot, at once, adopt the measure which we know the people prefer--I mean\r\nradical reform; that is to say, universal suffrage, vote by ballot, and\r\nannual parliaments? If we are to make a change, there can be no reason\r\nfor not going the full length that the people wish, if we can be sure\r\nthat the measure will not injure the Government--that to which they are\r\nattached--of King, Lords, and Commons.\r\n\r\n_October 4, 1831._\r\n\r\n_Necessity of the Influence of Property in the House of Commons._\r\n\r\nBut before we go further, it is desirable that we should examine what is\r\nthe Government of King, Lords, and Commons, as established in this\r\nkingdom. In this Government the King is at the head of everything. All\r\nthe power is in his hands. He is the head of the Church, the head of the\r\nlaw. Justice is administered in his name. He is the protector of the\r\npeace of the country, the head of its political negociations, and of its\r\narmed force--not a shilling of public money can be expended without his\r\norder and signature. But, notwithstanding these immense powers, the King\r\ncan do nothing that is contrary to law, or to the engagements of himself\r\nor his predecessors.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEvery act of the Government, or of the King, is liable to be brought\r\nunder discussion in, and is in fact controlled by, the House of Commons;\r\nand for this reason alone, it is important that we should consider of\r\nwhat description of men the House of Commons is likely to be composed,\r\nwhen we are discussing a question of Parliamentary Reform, in order\r\nthat we may be quite certain that they will exercise their high function\r\nwith wisdom and discretion.\r\n\r\nIt was on these grounds, that I, some time ago, called upon the noble\r\nEarl (Grey) to state by what influence he intended to carry on the\r\nKing's Government in Parliament, according to the principles fixed at\r\nthe period of the Revolution, and in practice from that period to this,\r\nwhen this Reform Bill should be passed. The noble Lord answered\r\nimmediately--not by means of corruption. I am aware of that, my Lords. I\r\nam convinced that the noble Lord is incapable of resorting to such\r\nmeans, as I hope he believes that I am incapable of resorting to them. I\r\ndid not consider this any answer to my question, which I repeated in a\r\nsubsequent discussion, on the motion of my noble friend, the noble Baron\r\nbehind me (Lord Wharncliffe). The noble Earl said, that the Government\r\nhad nothing to do with such questions; that Parliament was to decide for\r\nitself; and that there was no necessity for the interference of\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nI beg your Lordships to consider what are the questions which in every\r\nweek, and on every day, are brought under the discussion of the House of\r\nCommons--questions affecting the honour, the interests, the rights, the\r\nproperty, of every individual in the country, which the King is bound by\r\nhis oath to protect, and in the protection of which, all are equally\r\ninterested. They are questions regarding the proceedings of Courts of\r\nJustice, regarding the use of the public force, and hundreds of others,\r\nwhich occur daily, in which every individual is interested. I put\r\nlegislation out of the question; but can the King from that Throne give\r\nto his subjects the necessary protection for their rights and property?\r\nNo, my Lords. It is only by the influence of property over the election\r\nof Members of the House of Commons, and by the influence of the Crown\r\nand of this House, and of the property of the country upon its\r\nproceedings, that the great powers of such a body as the House of\r\nCommons can be exercised with discretion and safety. The King could not\r\nperform the duties of his high station, nor the House of Lords, if the\r\nHouse of Commons were formed on the principle and plan proposed by this\r\nbill.\r\n\r\n_October 4, 1831._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The Sacrifice of the Established Church will follow the Reform Bill._\r\n\r\nThere is one institution which would become peculiarly liable to attack\r\nin such a House of Commons, to which I wish to draw the attention of the\r\nRight Reverend Bench, and that is, the Establishment of the Church of\r\nEngland in Ireland. This Church is the object of a fundamental Article\r\nof the Treaty of Union between the two countries, and is secured by Acts\r\nof both Parliaments; and the King is, besides, sworn to maintain its\r\nright and possessions: can any man believe that, when the\r\nrepresentatives for Ireland come to be elected in the manner proposed by\r\nthe bill, the Church of England in Ireland can be maintained?\r\n\r\nI have already shown that these representatives must be elected under\r\nthe influence of the Roman Catholic hierarchy. Who are those who now\r\nshow the greatest hostility to the Church, its rights, and\r\npossessions?--the Members for populous places. The reason is, that the\r\ndeprivation of the Church of their property is one of the popular\r\nobjects of the day. The object of the bill is, and its effects will be,\r\nto increase the number of this description of Members in Parliament, and\r\nto render the influence of this party predominant and irresistible.\r\n\r\nI believe that the noble Earl (Grey) has already found the Members\r\nreturned by Ireland, under this influence, very inconvenient to himself,\r\nupon more than one occasion; and it appears, that the right honourable\r\nGentleman who conducts the affairs of Ireland in the House of Commons,\r\nwas under the necessity, very lately, of giving up a measure which he\r\nthought important for the benefit and peace of Ireland, because the\r\nMembers from Ireland, of this party, were opposed to it. How can the\r\nnoble Lord suppose, that the Church of England can be protected, or even\r\nthe Union itself preserved in a Reformed Parliament? There is no man,\r\nwho considers what the Government of King, Lords, and Commons is, and\r\nthe details of the manner in which it is carried on, who must not see,\r\nthat Government will become impracticable, when the three branches shall\r\nbe separate--each independent of the other, and uncontrolled in its\r\naction by any of the existing influences.\r\n\r\n_October 4, 1831._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Danger of a Democratic House of Commons._\r\n\r\nA noble earl (the Earl of Winchelsea) who has spoken on this side of the\r\nHouse, has made an observation to your Lordships, which well deserves\r\nyour attention. The noble earl has told you, that if you increase but a\r\nlittle the democratic power in the state, the step can never be\r\nwithdrawn. Your Lordships must continue in the same course till you have\r\npassed through the miseries of a revolution, and thence to a military\r\ndespotism, and the evils which attend that system of government. It is\r\nnot denied, that this bill must increase beyond measure the democratic\r\npower of the state--that it must constitute in the House of Commons a\r\nfierce democracy: what must be the consequences, your Lordships will\r\njudge.\r\n\r\nI will not detain your Lordships by adverting to the merits of the\r\nsystem of government which has existed up to the present moment, upon\r\nwhich my opinion is by no means altered. No man denies that we have\r\nenjoyed great advantages; that we have enjoyed a larger share of\r\nhappiness, comfort, and prosperity, for a long course of years, than\r\nwere ever enjoyed by any nation; that we have more riches, the largest\r\nfortunes, personal as well as real, more manufactures and commerce, than\r\nall the nations of Europe taken together; the richest, most extensive,\r\nmost peopled, and most prosperous foreign colonies and possessions, that\r\nany nation ever possessed. There is not an important position in the\r\nworld, whether for the purpose of navigation, commerce, or military\r\ndefence, that does not belong to us.\r\n\r\nIf this democratic assembly should once be established in England, does\r\nany one believe that we should continue to enjoy these vast advantages?\r\nBut a democracy has never been established in any part of the world,\r\nthat it has not immediately declared war against property--against the\r\npayment of the public debt--and against all the principles of\r\nconservation, which are secured by, and are, in fact, the principal\r\nobjects of the British constitution, as it now exists. Property, and its\r\npossessors, will become the common enemy. I do not urge this argument as\r\none in which your Lordships are peculiarly interested: it is not you\r\nalone, nor even other proprietors, who are interested in the protection\r\nof property; the whole people, middling classes as well as the lower\r\norders, are interested in this subject. Look at the anxiety prevailing\r\nin every part of London, in respect to the great revolution to be made\r\nby this bill. My noble friend, the noble baron (Lord Wharncliffe) has\r\nbeen ridiculed for adverting to the opinions of tradesmen in Bond-street\r\nand St. James's-street. Those in Bond-street consist of more than 200\r\nrespectable persons, who are well able to form an opinion of the effect\r\nof this bill upon the resources of themselves, the middling classes, and\r\nthe poor, as they supply the luxuries of persons in easier\r\ncircumstances, residing in that quarter of the town. Anything which can\r\neffect the resources of their customers, must be interesting to them,\r\nand they do feel that this bill must affect property, private\r\nexpenditure, and the resources of themselves, and of those whom they\r\nemploy. A noble lord on the other side, who adverted to this topic,\r\ngreatly underrated the wealth of these tradesmen. I know of one,\r\nresiding in Bond-street, who employs at all times from 2,000 to 4,000\r\nworkmen, whose trade depends, as well as the employment of this body of\r\npeople, upon the expenditure of his customers: is he not interested in\r\nupholding the public faith, and the system of property now established\r\nin England? Are not the people, of all classes and descriptions, down to\r\nthe lowest, interested in the maintenance of our extensive manufactures\r\nand commerce, in the conservation of our enormous dominions abroad, and\r\nthe continued respect of all nations?\r\n\r\nIf I am right in thinking that this fierce democracy will be established\r\nin the House of Commons, does any man believe that that harmony can\r\ncontinue between the king and his government and the House of Commons,\r\nso necessary to insure to both general respect, and to the king's\r\ngovernment the strength which is necessary to enable his Majesty to\r\nprotect and keep in order his foreign dominions, and to insure the\r\nobedience of their inhabitants? We shall lose these colonies and foreign\r\npossessions, and with them our authority and influence abroad.\r\n\r\nThere is no instance of any country having maintained its strength or\r\nits influence in its foreign possessions, or the respect of foreign\r\nnations, during the existence of internal troubles and disturbance; and\r\nthere is no case of the existence, without such troubles, of a\r\nGovernment consisting of King, Lords, and Commons, independently of each\r\nother, and the members of the latter depending solely upon the popular\r\nchoice, and being delegates of the people. We have had an example in\r\nEngland of a House of Commons which was independent of the influence of\r\nthe Crown; and of this House, turning the Spiritual Lords out of it,\r\nmurdering their Sovereign, and voting the House of Lords useless. I will\r\nread your Lordships the account given by a man, who was knowing in his\r\ntime (Oliver Cromwell), of what this House became.\r\n\r\n\"The parliament, which had so vigorously withstood the encroachments of\r\nthe royal power, became themselves too desirous of absolute authority;\r\nand not only engrossed the legislative, but usurped the executive power.\"\r\n\r\n\"All causes, civil and criminal, all questions of property, were\r\ndetermined by committees, who, being themselves the legislature, were\r\naccountable to no law, and for that reason their decrees were arbitrary,\r\nand their proceedings violent. Oppression was without redress, unjust\r\nsentence without appeal; there was no prospect of ease or intermission.\r\nThe parliament had determined never to dissolve themselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"At length the army interfered. They soon perceived that, unless they\r\nmade one regulation more, and crushed this many-headed monster, they had\r\nhitherto ventured their lives to little purpose, and had, instead of\r\nassuring their own and their country's liberty, only changed one kind of\r\nslavery for another.\"\r\n\r\nThis is the account of the state of a house of Commons acting\r\nindependently of all influence; and of the state to which it brought the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n_October 4, 1831._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Contempt of intimidation by popular meetings._\r\n\r\nI do not deny that I always felt strongly the attempts that were made to\r\nintimidate your Lordships by public meetings. For all such meetings, I\r\nfeel the greatest contempt; and I am perfectly satisfied that the house\r\nis superior to any intimidation founded on the proceedings of any such\r\nassemblages. I feel no concern for all those threats, whether proceeding\r\nfrom Birmingham or elsewhere. I have always thought, and I think still,\r\nthat the law is too strong to be overborne by such proceedings. I know\r\nfurther, that there does exist throughout this country a strong feeling\r\nof attachment to the government of the country, as by law established. I\r\nknow that the people look up to the laws as the best means of\r\nprotection, and those laws they will not violate in any manner to\r\nendanger the government of the country, or any of its established\r\ninstitutions. I am afraid of none of these, but I will tell your\r\nLordships what I am afraid of, I am afraid of revolution, and of\r\nrevolutionary measures, brought in and proposed by his Majesty's\r\ngovernment. I assert, and I believe that history will bear me out in the\r\nassertion, that there has been no revolution in this country, or any\r\ngreat change, which has not been brought about by the parliament, and\r\ngenerally by the government introducing measures, and carrying them\r\nthrough by the influence of the Crown. I would therefore entreat your\r\nLordships to do all you can to defeat this measure--use every means of\r\nresistance which the just exercises of your privileges will warrant; and\r\ntrust to the good sense of the country to submit to the legal and just\r\ndecision you come to.\r\n\r\n_October 5,1831._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Comparison of the Finance Administration of the Wellington with that of\r\nthe Grey government._\r\n\r\nI believe we find ourselves in this singular situation: we have an\r\nincreased expenditure, (increased within this year,) and have, at the\r\nsame time, a reduction of taxation, and no overplus whatever (or one not\r\namounting to more than 10,000 l.) of revenue. I say we are in that\r\npeculiar situation, because I put out of the question those occasions on\r\nwhich ministers of the crown have thought it their duty to propose and\r\neffect loans, to carry on the public service of the country. Even in\r\nthese cases, those who have made such propositions have thought it their\r\nduty to provide a surplus over revenue, in order to meet the unforeseen\r\ncasualties in the amount of revenue, which every man knows must occur\r\nin so large a revenue as this country has the happiness to boast of.\r\nThis principle of having a surplus revenue over the expenditure, has\r\nbeen considered advantageous with a view to the diminution of the\r\nnational debt. I am aware that this is a part of the subject on which a\r\ndifference of opinion exists. I am aware that many great authorities are\r\nof opinion that no surplus is necessary for the express purpose of\r\nreducing the national debt, and I perfectly agree with them that it is\r\nnot desirable that a surplus should be created by borrowing, and thus\r\ncreating new liabilities for the purpose of getting rid of the old. But\r\nI cannot look to what has taken place of late years, even in my own\r\ntime, when I filled the situation of first Lord of his Majesty's\r\nTreasury,--cannot look to what took place then without seeing the\r\nadvantage of having an overplus of income over expenditure, such as\r\nwould tend to the gradual diminution of the public debt.\r\n\r\nI am considerably within the truth when I state, that since the peace\r\nthe interest of the public debt has been decreased by an amount more\r\nthan sufficient to pay the interest of 100,000,000 l. of stock; and your\r\nLordships will therefore see that some surplus of revenue, in order to\r\nlead to a diminution of the public debt, is highly desirable. I think it\r\nis a principle of the financial policy of this country that there should\r\nbe such a surplus, and that it should be so applied. Besides, much of\r\nthe revenue of this country depends on the seasons, and almost all on\r\nconsumption; and the amount of consumption depends upon taste and\r\nfashion; and the change of taste and fashion, and other circumstances\r\nover which no man can have control, and which are liable to variations,\r\nmay tend to a variation in the amount of the revenue, which nothing can\r\nprovide against except a surplus revenue. It is on this principle that\r\nthe government to which I had the honour to belong proceeded.\r\n\r\nWe should not think that an individual provided for his expenses who\r\nshould leave a part of them to be paid within a future period, neither\r\ncan we think all the expenditure of the country is provided for, leaving\r\na part to be paid for in the next year. The sum expended for the service\r\nof the year is the sum to be paid, whether within the year or at any\r\nother period, for this sum provision ought to be made within the year,\r\nor debt is incurred. It is a new principle introduced into the financial\r\nsystem of this country; it is a principle which at any other time than\r\nthe present, would never have been listened to, much less tolerated by\r\nparliament for a moment.\r\n\r\n_October 17, 1831._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_King Leopold must be independent of Foreign Powers._\r\n\r\nI entertain the highest respect for Prince Leopold, and I trust that\r\nthat Prince will take upon himself the character of an independent\r\nsovereign, and I know that that illustrious person possesses all the\r\ntalents and disposition calculated to form a great and excellent\r\nsovereign; but I must say, that in order to be so, he must be not only\r\nindependent of this country, and of the Germanic states, but above all\r\nhe must be independent of France.\r\n\r\n_January 26, 1832._\r\n\r\n_The Grey policy tends to War, Foreign and Domestic._\r\n\r\nI say that the foreign policy of his Majesty's ministers is more likely\r\nto produce war abroad than any other system; and in the same manner\r\ntheir domestic policy is of all others, the best calculated to produce\r\nwar at home.\r\n\r\n_January 26, 1832._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Irish Agitation deprecated._\r\n\r\nMy Lords, the main cause of the present excitement is the encouragement\r\ngiven in Ireland to agitators to disturb the country. I can tell the\r\nnoble Earl, (Grey), that so long as encouragement is given to agitators,\r\nyou may double and treble the regular army in Ireland,--you may heap\r\nmeasures of severity upon measures of severity, but you will not succeed\r\nin putting down agitation upon this question, or upon any of the others\r\nwhich may follow it.\r\n\r\n_February 27th, 1832._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Tithes the most sacred kind of property._\r\n\r\nA noble Lord, the other night, in discussing the question of tithes,\r\nobserved that the people of Ireland are ready to pay that for which\r\nthey receive value, to pay their rent, and to pay all the taxes on the\r\nland, and that they wished not to deprive any man of his property. I say\r\nthen my Lords, is any property held so sacred by our laws as tithes? In\r\nthe first place, the King is sworn--his Majesty was sworn a few months\r\nago--to protect the property and rights of the clergy, above all classes\r\nof men. I desire also, to bring to your Lordships' recollection, that in\r\ntwo recent Acts of parliament, in which we conferred notable advantages\r\non the Dissenters from the Church of England, we endeavoured as far as\r\nwe might by oaths, to secure the property of the church. If any\r\nprinciple, indeed, can secure property to any portion of his Majesty's\r\nsubjects, the property of the church ought to be safe. It is a principle\r\nof the constitution that tithes, above all other property, should be\r\nsecured to the owner.\r\n\r\n_February 27th, 1832._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The Grey Government charged with encouraging Political Reform._\r\n\r\nMy Lords, I never have made, and I never will make, a charge which I am\r\nnot ready to repeat, and able to substantiate, and I will forthwith\r\nprove that which the noble Earl calls upon me to explain. In doing this\r\nI beg leave to remind your Lordships, that some months ago I suggested\r\nto the noble Earl, (Grey) that an Act of Parliament, which had been\r\npassed for the purpose of suppressing illegal associations in Ireland,\r\nwas about to expire, and I asked him, if he intended to propose a\r\nrenewal of that act. The noble Earl replied that he did; but my Lords,\r\nyou will recollect that parliament was dissolved without any further\r\nnotice of the act, and of course it expired. The result of this was,\r\nthat the noble Earl stated in the House, when it met again, that the\r\nnoble Marquis at the head of the Irish Administration felt that he could\r\ncarry on the government of that country without any additional powers;\r\nand the consequences of the noble Earl having declined to apply to the\r\nlegislature for any authority beyond the existing laws were, that\r\nagitation began again, and that meeting after meeting has been held,\r\nfrom that time to the present moment. This is not all, my Lords; the\r\ngreat agitator, the prime mover of the whole machinery, escaped the\r\nexecution of the sentence of the law in consequence of the expiration of\r\nthe Act of Parliament to which I have referred. Well my Lords, what has\r\nsince taken place. This very person, the great agitator, whom the\r\ngovernment had prosecuted to conviction, was considered to be a person\r\nworthy of the honours which the crown could bestow, and he received the\r\nhighest favour which any gentleman of the Bar ever received from the\r\nhands of the noble Earl and his government; he received a patent of\r\nprecedence, which placed him next the Attorney General, and above a\r\ngentleman who was once Attorney General, but was still a member of the\r\nsame Bar. If this was not a premium given to that gentleman to continue\r\nhis course of disturbing the country, I do not know what else could be\r\nso considered. I feel that no more effectual mode could be found to\r\nencourage agitation than to reward the promoter of it. But it is not\r\nalone in this respect that his Majesty's Government has encouraged\r\nagitation. What was the meaning, I ask, of the friends of government\r\ntaking the course they have taken out of doors, with reference to the\r\nReform Bill? What was the meaning of the letter of the noble Lord in\r\nanother house, addressed to the Political Union of Birmingham, in which\r\nthat noble Lord designated the sentiments of noble Peers on this side of\r\nthe House as the \"whisper of a faction?\"--What was the meaning of two\r\nfriends of government collecting a mob in Hyde Park, and the Regent's\r\nPark, on one of the days on which the House of Lords was discussing the\r\nReform Bill? What was the meaning of those individuals directing the\r\nline of march of the assembled multitude upon St. James's, and\r\npublishing their orders in the papers devoted to government? And what\r\nwas the meaning of the publications in the government newspapers,\r\nlibelling and maligning all those who opposed the Bill? What was the\r\nmeaning of all these deeds being allowed by government, and why did they\r\ntolerate and abet them, unless they calculated upon some advantages to\r\nthemselves in encouraging such agitation? I don't accuse the noble Earl\r\nof instigating those mobs--I do not mean to say, that he was delighted\r\nat seeing my house assailed, or any other work of destruction\r\ncommitted; but I say some of his colleagues, and some of the friends of\r\ngovernment, have encouraged and incited the people to works of violence.\r\nI must say, I have long felt on this subject very strongly. I feel that\r\nthe country is in a most dangerous state. I find the country is in a\r\nmost dangerous state, on account of government not taking the proper\r\nmeasures to put a stop to confusion and agitation; and on the contrary,\r\nin place of putting a stop to such scenes, allowing some Lords of his\r\nMajesty's household, to encourage and instigate the people to lawless\r\nacts.\r\n\r\n_February 27th, 1832._\r\n\r\n[Earl Grey had risen and denied that the Government had encouraged\r\nagitation upon which the Duke made the previous short but energetic\r\nspeech.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Mr. O'Connell ought not to have had a Patent of Precedence._\r\n\r\nIt has been urged, that professional honours should not be withheld from\r\na gentleman who is entitled to them, on account of political offences. I\r\nbeg to set the noble Lord right on that point. The offences of which Mr.\r\nO'Connell was convicted, were not political or professional, but legal\r\noffences. They were pronounced such by the law of the country; and it\r\nwas to an individual who had been convicted of such offences, that his\r\nMajesty's Government thought it right to give a patent of precedence in\r\nIreland.\r\n\r\n_February 27, 1832._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Opinion of the \"National\" System of Education in Ireland._\r\n\r\nI agree in opinion with the noble and learned Lord (Plunkett), who has\r\ndeclared that opinion with so much eloquence, that any system of\r\neducation, to succeed, must be founded on religion; and that it cannot\r\nstand on any other foundation. The noble and learned Lord has truly\r\nsaid, that this is to be desired, not simply from the advantages to be\r\nderived from religious instruction, but for the promotion of those\r\nhabits of obedience and discipline which it is necessary to instil into\r\nthe mind of youth. I admit that the system proposed by Ministers is\r\nfounded on, and justified by, the reports of the commissioners and of\r\ncommittees of the other House of Parliament; but the doubt I entertain\r\nis this--whether the system laid down in the reports, and in the letter\r\nof the Right Honourable Secretary for Ireland, is a system which would\r\ninculcate those habits of discipline and obedience which are required by\r\nthe noble and learned Lord, and which would alone satisfy my own mind,\r\nthat in adopting it we should be doing that which we ought to do: this\r\nis my apprehension. What I feel is this--that there is much doubt\r\nwhether the new system of education in Ireland will apply to the\r\neducation of nearly 500,000 persons, in the same advantageous way as is\r\nnow the case with the existing Societies--the London Hibernian Society,\r\nthe Sunday School Society, and the Kildare Place Society. What I would\r\nsay is, that there is already going on a system of religious education,\r\nextending its operation to nearer 500,000 than 400,000 persons--a system\r\nof real religious education, founded on the Scriptures, which can be\r\ninterfered with by nobody--neither by priest nor by any other man--and\r\nwhich is so directed by this Kildare Place Society, as not to give\r\noffence to anybody; and now, when the Government is about to establish\r\nanother system, (which I have admitted they are justified by the reports\r\nin doing), I doubt much whether it will not be attended with less\r\nadvantage than that which already exists.\r\n\r\nI am, myself, by no means satisfied that the system which is to be\r\nsubstituted is as good as that which it is proposed to abrogate. If the\r\nsystem is to be changed, I consider that it would be better, perhaps, to\r\nhave separate schools for the Protestants and Roman Catholics. Although\r\nI allow that this would be attended with many inconveniences, still I am\r\ninclined to think it would be better than the scheme proposed.\r\n\r\nI really cannot see the difference between public and private education;\r\nor why causes of dispute should arise between two classes of persons, if\r\neducated by favour of public grants, rather than between the same\r\nclasses if educated by private means. All classes of persons who are\r\neducated together, here, by their private means, agree quite well\r\ntogether, as Englishmen; and I do not see why they should not in like\r\nmanner agree, if they happen to be educated by public grants.\r\n\r\n_February 28, 1832._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Character of the Irish Agitation._\r\n\r\nThe present state of things in Ireland is to be attributed to the system\r\nof agitation, established by persons who will never be quiet as long as\r\nthe noble Lord at the head of the Government shall permit them to\r\nproceed. It is not, I repeat, to be attributed to the practices or\r\nconduct of the clergy, or to the Tithe Corporation Act, or even to the\r\nwant of enforcing that Act, but to that system of agitation, combined in\r\nthe most artful manner, and carried on with a perseverance unequalled on\r\nany other occasion; and the noble Lords may rely upon it, that the state\r\nof things which now prevails in Ireland[15] will continue to exist even\r\nafter this measure shall have been adopted, if that system of agitation\r\nis not put an end to.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: Resistance to the payment of tithe.]\r\n\r\n_March 8, 1832._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Protection, not Free Trade, the Principle of our Commercial Law._\r\n\r\nNothing can be more absurd, than to assert that there is free trade in\r\nthis country; there is no such thing--there can be no such thing. Our\r\nmanufactures and our produce have been at all times protected. We have\r\nalways given protection to the productions of our own soil, and\r\nencouragement to our domestic labours; and we have, therefore, rather\r\ndiscouraged, than otherwise, the rivalry of other countries. That has\r\nbeen our system; and I should be sorry to see any measure adopted by\r\nthis House, opposed to that system under which this country has so many\r\nyears thriven and prospered. We have always proceeded on the principle\r\nof protecting our manufactures and our produce--the produce of our\r\nlabour and our soil; of protecting them against importation, and\r\nextending our home consumption; and on that universal system of\r\nprotection it is absurd to talk of free trade.\r\n\r\n_March 9, 1832._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The Lord Chancellor's Patronage. Its Private Disposal Defended._\r\n\r\nMy noble and learned friend (the Earl of Eldon) has been attacked for\r\nhaving, in the exercise of the patronage of his office, not overlooked\r\nthe interests of his own family. To be sure he did not, and he ought not\r\nto have done so; if he had, he would only have been departing from the\r\npractice of all his predecessors. Let me remind your Lordships, that for\r\nat least a century and a half back, the Lord Chancellor and Judges have\r\ninvariably dispensed the patronage attached to their offices in favour\r\nof their own immediate relations; so that my noble and learned friend,\r\nin providing for his own family as well as he could, was only acting\r\naccording to the uniform and acknowledged practice of all his\r\npredecessors. The fact is, that the office of Lord Chancellor would be\r\nvery inadequately remunerated, unless the individual filling it procured\r\nthe means of providing for his family; and I believe it will be found\r\nout ere long, what with this inadequate remuneration, and what with\r\nstripping off so much of the Chancellor's patronage, and what with the\r\nsurrendering up so much of his bankruptcy fees,--that the remuneration\r\nwill be so inadequate to the labour and change of habits, and expense\r\nconsequent upon the assumption of the office,--that few eminent\r\ngentlemen at the bar will, in future, be disposed to accept of it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor the reason by which I justified my noble and learned friend, I will\r\nsay that the noble and learned lord opposite, (Lord Plunkett) was\r\njustified in the exercise of his official patronage. That noble and\r\nlearned lord has a large family, and was perfectly right in placing them\r\nin those situations to which their abilities and pretensions were\r\nadequate. The only blame in such a case would be if he placed them in\r\nsituations to which their abilities were not equal. I will therefore say\r\nthat the learned lord was perfectly justified in the course he has\r\npursued; and I will say more, that his high office and his great\r\nintellectual influence, fully entitled him to expect that the\r\ngovernment, of which he was a member, should give his family a\r\npreference in filling up any situations to which, as I have stated,\r\ntheir abilities were equal. I agree with the noble Earl at the head of\r\nhis Majesty's government, in hoping that this will be the last we shall\r\nhear of this senseless outcry against public men for this mode of\r\ndisposing of the patronage of office. The time of the house is but ill\r\nspent with such discussions; indeed, I am sure that nothing can tend\r\nmore to injure its character in public estimation, than these\r\ninvestigations of the family affairs of men in high stations; at all\r\nevents, they tend more to lower the house than benefit the public, and\r\nthe sooner we put an end to them the better.\r\n\r\n_March 12, 1832._\r\n\r\n_Peace with France desirable, but difficult to maintain._\r\n\r\nThere does exist in the minds of the people of France, a sentiment,\r\nwhich their government at the present day are but too prone to flatter.\r\nI allude to that morbid desire of extended conquest, which, at least for\r\nthe last forty years, has so much influenced the character and\r\nproceedings of that people.\r\n\r\nThere is no man who would be more ready than I should in taking every\r\nstep calculated to promote a good understanding between that country and\r\nthis. I consider quite as much as the noble Earl (Grey) opposite can\r\npossibly do, that every measure tending to that end is a measure of\r\nnecessity--is a measure of such urgency and importance, that I consider\r\nit second only to the honour and interests of this country,--those I\r\ntake to be the very first objects to which a British Minister should\r\ndirect his attention, regardless of every consideration which might\r\ninterfere with them. Well then, admitting as fully as any noble Lord can\r\ndesire, that it must be at all times a leading object with this country\r\nto preserve peaceful relations with France, I will tell the noble Earl\r\nopposite, that if he would remain at peace with France, peace must be\r\npreserved by this country in union with the other powers of Europe, and\r\nnot by this country singly. I tell him that the affair at Ancona is but\r\na trifling warning of that which will soon follow, unless a constant\r\nsystem of precaution be kept up. I tell him that if that affair be\r\npassed over without notice, new attempts will be made, every one of them\r\nmore and more dishonourable and disadvantageous to this country. When I\r\nam told that we should not utter remonstrances against the French\r\ngovernment lightly, nor too readily impute a disposition to disturb the\r\namicable relations at present subsisting between the two countries, I\r\nanswer that no one more earnestly desires peace than I do. There is no\r\none entertains a higher estimate than I do of the resources--the\r\nimmensity of the resources--possessed by that country both in peace and\r\nin war--no man living estimates more highly than I do the wisdom of her\r\nstatesmen and the skill of her generals--no man is more ready than\r\nmyself to concede to the French people the possession of a large amount\r\nof talent and of virtue, of physical and of moral resources, and of all\r\nthat renders a state respectable or formidable in the eyes of other\r\nnations. But in proportion as we admit these facts, we are bound to\r\nwatch closely that nothing be done or said derogatory from British\r\nhonour or injurious to British interests.\r\n\r\n_March 16, 1832._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Opinion of the Reform Bill, 1832._\r\n\r\nI beg your Lordships to recollect that this is the point which the\r\nHouse will have to consider:--the question is not whether alterations\r\nhave been made in this part or that part, or in many parts of the bill\r\nwhich your Lordships objected to last session, but the question you will\r\nhave to consider is this--Whether this bill, if passed and accompanied,\r\nlet it be recollected, with the other bills at present in the other\r\nHouse of Parliament, will afford to the country a prospect of having a\r\ngovernment under which the country can go on--under which it will be\r\npracticable that this or any other can be governed--or which, in the\r\nwords of the noble Earl who addressed your Lordships first this evening\r\nemployed last session--if practicable, would not be pernicious. That is\r\nthe question which your Lordships will have to consider, when you come\r\nto the second reading of the bill. The principle of this measure is not\r\nreform, but the disfranchisement of some places and the enfranchisement\r\nof others, and also the granting of votes to large bodies of persons on\r\na new qualification. The total alteration of the representation of this\r\ncountry, coupled with an alteration of the representation of Scotland,\r\namounting there to a complete revolution, and the overthrow in Ireland\r\nof all the measures which were adopted in that country three years\r\nago--these, and not reform, are what your Lordships must consider as the\r\nprinciples of the bill. I entertain the same opinion as the noble earl\r\nnear me as to the necessity of reform. My opinion on this point is now\r\nas it was originally. But how comes the question now before your\r\nLordships? it has been altered considerably, and is no longer what it\r\nwas before.\r\n\r\nThe noble Earl has thrown out some imputations with respect to party\r\nmotives--if the noble Earl meant them to apply to me he is much\r\nmistaken, I have no party views to serve. I believe there is scarcely an\r\nindividual in this house, or in the country, who has so little to do\r\nwith borough interests or county interests, or any sort of Parliamentary\r\ninterests as I have. I have the same interest in the country as any\r\nother individual, that is to say, I wish to see the representation\r\nestablished on such a basis as will give the country a prospect of a\r\npracticable system of government.\r\n\r\nIf the bill should go into committee, I will lend my best assistance to\r\nrender it as consistent with the true interests of the country as it can\r\nbe made, keeping in view always this great point--that on the nature of\r\nthe representative system depend the character and form of government.\r\n\r\n_April 10, 1832._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The House of Commons that carried Reform was an Assembly of Delegates._\r\n\r\nThe noble Baron, (Lord Wharncliffe) in a memorable speech delivered to\r\nthis house in the month of March, 1831, previously to the last general\r\nelection, stated to this house, in the strongest terms, that the result\r\nof that election must be to secure the return to the House of Commons of\r\ndelegates of the people; not members of the House of Commons to\r\nconsider de Adrias Regni, but to decide upon a measure of parliamentary\r\nreform proposed to them in a moment of excitement, and the result would\r\nbe, to place this house in the situation in which it was placed last\r\nyear, and in which it stands on the present occasion.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, is all to be lost, because the noble Lords opposite have taken\r\nthis course? Is this House to be destroyed? Or is it to lend its aid to\r\ndestroy the constitution, because Ministers persevere in this course?\r\nWould it not be more wise to call upon his Majesty to place things as\r\nthey were, previous to this unfortunate and ill-advised revolution of\r\nparliament; to advise his Majesty to remove his ministers from his\r\nconfidence, in order that things might be placed in the same situation\r\nin which they stood before, and that this house and the country might\r\nhave an opportunity, if possible, of having a fair discussion on the\r\nmeasure of reform. What! my Lords, is it to be said that the country is\r\nto be tied down to be governed by a system which no man can say is\r\npracticable? and can any body deny that the House of Commons, which\r\nconsents to such a proposition, is a delegated House of Commons? All the\r\narguments regarding the decisions of the House of Commons must come to\r\nthe same end. There would, no doubt, be ten decisions of the same kind,\r\nif it were left to the same house, because the house is pledged and\r\nreturned for the purpose. But the country is not to be abandoned on this\r\naccount.[16]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: This and the other succeeding passages on the subject of\r\nReform, were delivered on the second reading of the final reform bill,\r\nafter the Earl of Harrowby and other Tory peers had resolved on giving\r\nway to the House of Common and the Crown.]\r\n\r\nApril 10, 1832.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Means by which the Reform Fever was excited and kept up._\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt whatsoever that there was no opinion existing in\r\nthe country, in the year 1829, and the beginning of 1830, in favour of\r\nparliamentary reform. I believe this is a fact which was fully admitted\r\nin the discussions of the House of Commons at that time. Then my Lords,\r\ncame the French Revolution, which occurred at the period of the\r\ncommencement of the elections of 1830, followed by the insurrection in\r\nBelgium; and there can be no doubt that these events occasioned a very\r\ngreat excitement at the elections of members of parliament. There were\r\nmany declarations in favour of parliamentary reform; and all that passed\r\non the subject of parliamentary reform on that occasion, was calculated\r\nto influence, and did very considerably influence, the opinions of that\r\nparliament upon that question. The noble Lords opposite then came into\r\npower, and I will say, my Lords, that they met a parliament ready to\r\npass a measure of moderate parliamentary reform. But the noble Lords\r\nopposite thought proper, instead of carrying such a measure, to dissolve\r\nthat parliament, and a new parliament was called under a degree of\r\nexcitement in the public mind such as had never before been witnessed.\r\nThe excitement has continued, to a certain degree, ever since, and it\r\nhas been kept up by the strong opinion put forward and entertained, that\r\nit is the King who wishes for parliamentary reform in the manner\r\nproposed by this bill. Now, my Lords, I say it is no such thing; for my\r\npart, I do not believe one word of any such assertion. My opinion is,\r\nthat the King follows the advice of his servants; but I believe that it\r\nis the idea thus engendered which renders it difficult that there should\r\nnot be some reform. It is not, however, to be supposed that the King\r\ntakes any interest in the subject. I entertain no doubt that the cause\r\nof the great excitement upon this subject is, that it is the King's\r\nopinion that the bill ought to be carried. The noble Earl would find the\r\ncountry cool upon the subject if the King's mind were altered. He would\r\nnot be able to pass this bill; and indeed, I am sure, from experience,\r\nthat if ministers, on any great constitutional question, were not\r\nconvinced that the King would go through with them, it would be\r\nimpossible for any set of ministers to carry any such measure.\r\n\r\n_April_ 10, 1832.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The best part of the Public do not wish the Reform Bill_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe opinion of the gentlemen of the country,--I speak from my own\r\nknowledge with respect to the southern counties, and from sure report as\r\nto other counties generally,--but I do say that the opinion of the\r\ngentlemen, of the landed property, and of the learning of the country,\r\nis against this bill. The bill is, on the other hand, supported by the\r\nnoble Lords opposite, and by their adherents, certainly not a numerous\r\nclass; it is also supported by all the dissenters from the church of\r\nEngland, and by all who wish it should pass, as a means of their\r\nobtaining votes, but I will repeat, that it is, in fact, opposed to the\r\nsentiments of all the real English gentlemen, of the yeomanry, and of\r\nthe middle classes throughout the country. Yes, my Lords, I will say,\r\nthat there is a change of opinion, and that the best part of the public\r\nare not desirous for the bill, but are, on the contrary, apprehensive of\r\nits effects. But the noble Lords will say;--\"We hear none of this.\" No\r\nmy Lords; and why do we hear none of this? Because there is scarcely a\r\ngentleman in the country who can believe that, if he were to attend a\r\npublic meeting for the purpose of expressing his sentiments on this\r\nquestion, he would be secure or protected from the attacks of the mob.\r\n\r\n_April_ 10, 1832\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_No Compromise_.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Lords, I must now advert to what has fallen from another noble Earl\r\n(Harrowby), who opposed the bill strongly last year, but who last night\r\ncame to a different conclusion, and asked if there was no hope of\r\neffecting a compromise? and he particularly called upon me to come to\r\nsuch a compromise. My Lords, these noble Lords have been trying a\r\ncompromise for the last six months; if they have made no progress in\r\neffecting a compromise, what encouragement can they hold out to me and\r\nothers to follow them upon this occasion. We know the evils of this\r\nbill; we know that it will consign the country to evils from which it\r\ncannot recover. Agree to a compromise! Why, he has not been enabled to\r\nadvance one single step from last October up to the present moment. He,\r\nand his noble Friends who act with him, have remained perfectly\r\nstationary. If this be the case, I hope that those who intend to act\r\nwith my noble Friends, will understand that there is no more chance of\r\ncompromise on the present than on the last occasion; and that if they\r\nagree to the second reading, they agree to a bill with which the country\r\ncannot be governed. I beg then that the noble Lords will look to the\r\nresponsibility they take upon themselves, in giving support to this\r\nbill. The Government are now decidedly responsible for that bill--they\r\nare responsible for the election of the House of Commons, that passed\r\nit--they are responsible for the excitement which caused these\r\nevents--and they are, moreover, responsible for any evil consequences\r\nwhich may occur, if this House reject it. But when noble Lords change\r\ntheir sentiments, and are followed by many who voted against it last\r\ntime, I beg them to recollect, that they will partake of a large portion\r\nof this responsibility, and that the country will look to them as\r\nresponsible for whatever may occur.[17]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: The bill was soon after carried by a species of\r\ncompromise, Peers staying away from the division.]\r\n\r\n_April_ 10,1832.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Revolutions may be effected by Laws as well as by Violence._\r\n\r\nThe noble earl (Grey) yesterday challenged me with saying that this bill\r\nis revolutionary. What I have always said is, that it has a\r\nrevolutionary tendency; and I think it has a tendency so strong in that\r\nway that it must lead to revolution. The noble earl has said there is no\r\nviolence; but, my Lords, revolutions may be effected by laws as well as\r\nby violence. I know there is no violence. Why, my Lords, there can be no\r\nviolence,--the King's Government and the House of Commons are leagued\r\nwith those who call out for change,--and there can be no occasion for\r\nresorting to violence. But, my Lords, this is not the only objection.\r\nOne of the great and leading objections in my mind to this measure is,\r\nthat it is one which goes to destroy that most invaluable principle of\r\nour existing constitution, the principle of prescription, which\r\nsanctions the descent and secures the possession of all kinds of\r\nproperty in this country.\r\n\r\n_April_ 10,1832.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The Demagogue will drive the Gentleman from the Representation._\r\n\r\nThe noble Earl has told us, that men possessing property in these\r\nboroughs will continue to possess their just influence in them--that\r\nthey will have political influence in the elections--that it will\r\ncontinue, and that it ought to continue. But I would appeal to your\r\nLordships, whether your own experience, in matters of this description,\r\nconfirms the correctness of this statement? It is true that, in some of\r\nthese boroughs, noblemen possessing large properties in the\r\nneighbourhood will still possess a great and paramount influence; and,\r\nindeed, in some places, in consequence of the effect of the double\r\nfranchise, the influence of the great proprietors in the vicinity may be\r\nraised greatly beyond what it is at present. But in those towns in\r\ngeneral, it will be the demagogue, and not the nobleman or gentleman of\r\nproperty, who will possess the influence over the elections there. The\r\nlatter cannot command such an influence, unless through the means of a\r\nconstant expenditure which it would be impossible for any one to\r\nsupport. The demagogue will obtain his influence by other means, and\r\nwill ultimately drive the gentleman out of the field. I beg your\r\nLordships to observe what will be the effect of such a state of things\r\nin the constitution of the House of Commons; and I beg to ask whether,\r\nwith such men the representatives of those boroughs, it will be possible\r\nto carry on anything like a government or a steady system of policy,\r\nthrough the means of this assembly.\r\n\r\n_April_ 10, 1832.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Prophetic Contrast of the New with the Old System._\r\n\r\nI know that according to the constitution of this country, a member of\r\nthe House of Commons when he goes there is a member for all parts of\r\nEngland, and not a representative for the particular town or place for\r\nwhich he is elected; he is in fact looked upon as a member for all the\r\nCommons of England. This was hitherto the meaning which was attached to\r\nthe character of a Member of the Commons House of Parliament. But the\r\ncase will be widely different should this Bill be passed, and should\r\nMembers of Parliament be subjected to a system of instruction on the\r\npart of their constituents. That system, however, already exists in\r\nparts of England, and more especially in the Metropolis, and in the\r\nBorough of Southwark. Your Lordships will remember that an honourable\r\nand gallant officer, formerly connected with the noble Lords opposite,\r\nwas obliged to retire from the representation of Southwark, last summer,\r\nbecause he happened to differ with his constituents; and also that a\r\nworthy Alderman was in a similar manner reprimanded by his constituents\r\nin the city of London, for a similar offence. What then, I would ask\r\nyour Lordships, is to be expected hereafter, should the system laid down\r\nin this Bill be established in this country? Why every member of the\r\nHouse of Commons would become the mere delegate of his constituents,\r\ninstead of representing the people at large. It has been observed that\r\nsuch representatives would in every case merely consult the wishes of\r\ntheir respective constituents, instead of looking to the advancement of\r\nthe interests of all classes. I have before me a letter written by a\r\ngentleman to some of his constituents in this neighbourhood, in which he\r\ndesires not only that the electors shall direct the votes of their\r\nrepresentatives, and point out the course which they should pursue in\r\nparliament, but goes much further. The letter, which is directed to the\r\nparishioners of St. Georges in the East, says, \"there ought to be an\r\nunion formed in every parish between the middle classes and the\r\noperatives,--first for the protection of person and property; and\r\nsecondly, to be ready to express the opinion of the parish on any public\r\nmeasure, and in case the minister or the House of Commons are lukewarm\r\nin the cause of the people.\" The extract which I have just read is taken\r\nfrom a letter written by a great advocate of the Reform Bill, not for\r\nthe sake of the Reform Bill itself, but because it would lead to\r\nsomething further. This letter affords a proof of the kind of system\r\nwhich will be put into operation with respect to the members of the\r\nHouse of Commons, should this Bill be passed. Let your Lordships, then,\r\nfor a moment, compare the system this Bill would establish, with the\r\nsystem of representation which has so long existed in this country, and\r\nunder which this country has been raised to such an eminence of glory,\r\nand power, and prosperity.\r\n\r\nWe have, under the existing system, the county representation, and the\r\nrepresentation in cities and boroughs. The county representation\r\nconsists principally of freeholders, and the members for counties\r\nrepresent not only the lower classes, but the middle and higher orders.\r\nThe representatives for the great maritime towns, and for the larger\r\ndescription of towns in the interior of the country, represent likewise\r\nthe lower and middle classes. The representatives for the pot wallopping\r\nboroughs, for the scot-and-lot boroughs, and for the single borough of\r\nPreston, where the franchise is vested in the inhabitants at large,\r\nrepresent the lowest orders of the people; and in this manner this\r\nborough representation represents all classes and descriptions of\r\npersons, who have any thing to do with the business transacted in the\r\nHouse of Commons. Instead of this system, which has raised this country\r\nto its present elevation, we are called upon to establish by this Bill a\r\nsystem of elections which will be confined to one single class of the\r\ncommunity; and as the county representations will be no check upon this\r\nclass of persons, the voters in the counties being mostly of the same\r\ndescription, and as the united representation of Scotland, and of\r\nIreland, will be a check upon them, such a system will tend at once to a\r\ncomplete democracy. This, then, is the system which we are called upon\r\nto establish in the place of that which at present exists, and under\r\nwhich all classes and interests of the country are represented in\r\nParliament, and it is under such a system as this that it is pretended\r\nthe general business of the state can be carried on, and the government\r\nmaintain sufficient power to preserve existing institutions.\r\n\r\n_April_ 10,1832.\r\n\r\n_Popular tendency of the Old System of Representation._\r\n\r\nI would call the attention of your Lordships to the changes which have\r\ntaken place in the government of the country during the last twenty\r\nyears,--to go no further back,--and to the improvements which have taken\r\nplace in what is called the popular sense. A noble friend of mine, last\r\nnight, truly stated that the influence of the Crown was decreasing from\r\nthe period of the revolution up to the year 1782; and that it has been\r\nstill further diminishing from that period up to the present time, till\r\nat last there are not more than fifty persons in the House of Commons\r\nholding public offices. In that period, and more especially in latter\r\nyears, the influence of the crown in this respect has been greatly\r\ndiminished. First of all, there has been a large reduction of all such\r\nkinds of offices; and in the next place, in consequence of the different\r\nconstitution and regulations of the customs and excise, and other public\r\ndepartments; and thus the influence formerly possessed by the Crown has\r\ngradually passed away.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWith the influence of the Crown, then, thus diminished, if a Bill of\r\nthis description should pass, to make such an extensive change in the\r\nconstitution of this House, it would be impossible to carry on the\r\ngovernment of the country. But there has also been another most\r\nremarkable alteration with respect to the constitution of Parliament\r\nwithin the last four years. In the year 1828, the Test Act was repealed;\r\nand this I beg your Lordships to recollect, that the effect of the\r\nrepealing this Act was immediately to bring into operation a large body\r\nof electors, who must of course have had considerable influence in\r\nsubsequent elections. Again, in the following year, the disabilities of\r\nthe Roman Catholics were removed, which made another important\r\ndifference in the constitution of Parliament. Has sufficient time been\r\ngiven to those measures to ascertain their effect? Is it not reasonable,\r\nis it not right, that we should try the effect of those measures on the\r\nconstitution, before we proceed further, before we adopt a measure which\r\nwill effect such extraordinary changes as this proposed Reform Bill?\r\nThere can be no doubt but that those measures to which I have alluded,\r\nmust have had considerable effect in the elections which have since\r\ntaken place, and more especially when any measure of Parliamentary\r\nReform has been adopted, of the same extensive character as that\r\ncontemplated in the Bill.\r\n\r\n_April_ 10, 1832.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Gradual Reform Recommended._\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that there is a general desire in the country,---\r\nI do not deny the existence of it, for it is stated in all the\r\naddresses and all the petitions on the subject;--that there is a general\r\ndesire in the country that some Reform in Parliament should be taken\r\ninto consideration, to do away with the abuses in the system of\r\nelections of Members of the House of Commons. Without enquiring into the\r\ncause, if the fact be as I have stated, which I believe no one will\r\ndispute, it is the duty of Parliament to proceed steadily and gradually\r\nin making amendments in the representation. We should consider maturely\r\nevery step that we took,--we should not proceed all at once to do every\r\nthing, we should go on gradually and deliberately; and thus in process\r\nof time, we might arrive even at the measure which has been recommended\r\nby the noble Earl at the head of his Majesty's government; but this must\r\nbe in process of time. After a considerable length of time had elapsed,\r\nand after we had maturely considered every step that we had taken, it\r\nwould be only after we had done all that, that we could adopt a measure\r\nto the extent of that recommended by the noble Earl. This we must do, if\r\nwe desire to maintain the venerable monarchy under which the country has\r\nflourished for so long a time. The effect of this measure, if carried\r\nnow, will be to establish such a government as exists elsewhere, (in\r\nFrance) which the noble Earl has described as a government which no man\r\ncould think fit for the administration of affairs in this country.\r\n\r\n_April_ 10,1839.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Effect of Agitation on Business_.\r\n\r\nI believe that as soon as this Bill was proposed, and as soon as the\r\nexcitement which it occasioned was apparent, all expenditure of all\r\ndescriptions ceased,--men ceased to lay out money in great\r\nenterprises--and those who expended their incomes to the full amount,\r\nbegan to consider whether it was not expedient to make provision for a\r\nfuture day, for a period of trouble and difficulty, which might be\r\nanticipated from these changes. It is to these circumstances that I am\r\ninduced to attribute the want of commerce and trade in the country. If\r\nyour Lordships look to the situation of our neighbours it will appear\r\nthat the same causes have produced precisely the same effects, and that\r\nthese causes have proceeded further amongst them, than they have with\r\nus, because they have existed for a longer period of time. Among them\r\npopular delirium has been carried nearly to its full extent; among us it\r\nhas only begun. I particularly complain of the system of agitation which\r\nnow prevails in England, for this reason, that it falls upon the poorest\r\nand lowest classes of the community. The expenditure of the rich gives\r\ncomfort and ease to the middle classes, but it gives subsistence to the\r\npoor; and it is for want of this subsistence and comfort for the lower\r\nclasses, that agitation has been carried to such an extent.\r\n\r\n_April_ 10, 1832.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Military Force will be required to Govern the Country if the Reform\r\nBill is carried._\r\n\r\nThe noble Viscount, one of his Majesty's Secretaries of State, who spoke\r\nyesterday upon the subject, admitted that he did not expect that the\r\nReform measure would relieve any of the distresses of the country. It\r\ncertainly does appear most extraordinary, that a Minister, particularly\r\na Secretary of State, should say of a measure, which he is supporting\r\nhimself, and which he knows must have such extensive consequences as the\r\nmeasure now proposed, that he does not believe that it will tend to\r\nrelieve any of the existing distresses of the country. But I say not\r\nonly that it will not relieve any of the distresses of the country, but,\r\non the contrary, that it will deeply aggravate them. But let us go a\r\nlittle further, and see whether this system is good; and whether the\r\nsystem of cheap government, which it is to introduce, is likely to\r\nproduce good to the country. And here, again, I would wish to call the\r\nattention of your Lordships to what is passing in another country. If\r\nyour Lordships will take the trouble of examining what has passed in\r\nFrance in the course of the last two years, you will see that, during\r\nthat period, that country has expended 50,000,000 l. sterling beyond its\r\nusual expenditure. Its ordinary Budget, notwithstanding every\r\ndescription of saving that could be made from the Civil List, and in\r\nother establishments, which have been cut down as low as possible--still\r\nits ordinary Budget exceeds the Budget of the former reign--the\r\nextravagant reign of the Bourbons--to the amount of 10,000,000 l.\r\nsterling; and, including those laws for two years, there is the\r\nextraordinary expenditure of 50,000,000 l. in that space of time. To say,\r\nthen, that popular excitement tends to cheap government, is monstrous\r\nand absurd, and it is impossible for any man who regards these facts to\r\narrive at that conclusion. We are called upon to adopt a system which is\r\nto lead to these results. I ask, then, whether such a system can be more\r\neffectual in this country, than that under which we have so long\r\nprospered? I ask, whether the Civil Government will have more\r\npower--whether it is possible that the Government can be carried on with\r\na smaller proportion of the army? I beg your Lordships to observe the\r\ntransactions which have occurred at Paris within the last two years, and\r\nyou will see that, while Louis XVIII, and Charles X. were able to\r\nmaintain the peace and tranquillity of the capital with a gendarmerie of\r\nfrom 500 to 1000 men,--since the period of the revolution of July, 1830,\r\nthe Government has not had less than 60,000 once a month put into\r\nrequisition to maintain the peace of the city. I say once a month, upon\r\nan average, not to exaggerate the facts; being convinced that upon not\r\nless than twenty-four occasions the army has been under arms.\r\n\r\nIf the system now proposed to your Lordships is adopted, will any man\r\ntell me that it will be possible for any Government to be carried on, as\r\nthe Government of this country has hitherto been, by a civil power,\r\naided by a small military force? In the course of this last summer,\r\nevents of a fearful character occurred, nearly at the same time, in this\r\ncountry and in France. I allude to the disturbances at Bristol and at\r\nLyons. The riots at Bristol were put down by ninety men, as soon as an\r\nofficer was found who would employ the force entrusted to him. But what\r\nhappened at Lyons--were the disturbances there so easily quelled? The\r\nevents at Lyons--a larger town, I admit, but not much larger than\r\nBristol--required 40,000 troops to be brought against the town, under\r\nthe command of a Marshal of France, the present Minister-at-War, and a\r\nPrince of the Blood, before tranquillity could be restored. I entreat,\r\nthen, your Lordships to consider well, first of all, the causes of this\r\ndifference,--to see that it is the sovereignty of the people that you\r\nare called upon to establish in this country,--and whether it is\r\npossible to carry on the civil Government of England, as it has hitherto\r\nbeen, under such a Government as you would establish, if you pass this\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n_April_ 10,1832.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Fiscal Regulations for the Extinction of Slavery not defensible._\r\n\r\nI can hardly bring myself to believe that any Government can think of\r\nforcing the Colonies to adopt Orders in Council, by holding out, at\r\nonce, promises and threats; by saying that those Colonies which adopted\r\nthem should not pay taxes, and that those which did not adopt them\r\nshould continue to pay them. Did any man ever before hear of taxes\r\nbeing imposed, for any purpose whatever, excepting to supply the\r\nnecessities of the State? If taxes be necessary for the purposes of the\r\nState, in the name of God let them be paid; but, if they be not\r\nnecessary, they ought not to be imposed at all, nor allowed to continue.\r\nParliament is not justified in imposing taxes for a specific purpose of\r\npunishment.\r\n\r\n_April_ 17, 1832.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_West India Property not to be Sacrificed to the Fancies of\r\nAbolitionists._\r\n\r\nIt is really desirable that this question should be well understood in\r\nthis country. West Indian property is as much entitled to protection as\r\nany other property which exists in Great Britain. Petitions are sent up\r\nfrom all parts of England, praying for the immediate abolition of\r\nslavery; and the execution of that measure is urged as a duty incumbent\r\nupon us. Those persons who take a part in these proceedings, forget the\r\nenormous amount of property belonging to his Majesty's subjects which is\r\ninvolved in the question; and it is necessary to bring back their\r\nattention to the consequences which will result, not only to the\r\ncolonists, but to the public, from the annihilation of that property, by\r\nthe prosecution of any of their fancies respecting the abolition of\r\nslavery. In truth, it is absolutely impossible to derive any advantage\r\nfrom that property except through the medium of slavery; and through\r\nslavery alone can the individuals interested in the occupation of that\r\nproperty be sustained in life.\r\n\r\n_April_ 17, 1832.\r\n\r\n_Speech explaining the Negociations, in May, 1832, for the formation of\r\na Tory Government on the principle of Moderate Reform._\r\n\r\nMy Lords, I have the honour to present to your Lordships a petition from\r\nthe inhabitant householders of Cambridge against the Reform Bill; and,\r\nas this is the first time I have had occasion to address your Lordships\r\nsince I have been charged by his Majesty with a most important\r\ncommission, I conceive that your Lordships, or, at least, some of you,\r\nmay be desirous that I should avail myself of this, or some other early\r\nopportunity, to explain the nature and termination of the transactions\r\nin which I have been engaged; and I confess, my Lords, that having been\r\nexposed to extreme misrepresentation, and having been vilified in the\r\nmost extraordinary manner, in respect of these transactions, by persons\r\nin another place, who, with the exception of their conduct in this\r\ninstance, have some claim to be considered respectable, I am anxious to\r\ntake the first opportunity of stating to your Lordships, and the\r\ncountry, the nature of the transactions in which I have been engaged,\r\nand the grounds on which I have proceeded. Your Lordships will\r\nrecollect, that in the course of the last week--I think it was on\r\nWednesday--his Majesty's ministers informed your Lordships that they had\r\noffered certain advice to his Majesty in reference to the important\r\nsubject of the Reform Bill; and, as his Majesty had not thought proper\r\nto follow that advice, they had considered it their duty to tender their\r\nresignations to his Majesty, and which resignations his Majesty was\r\npleased to accept. His Majesty was graciously pleased, on that day on\r\nwhich he was so left entirely alone by his ministers, to send for a\r\nnoble friend of mine--a noble and learned Lord (Eldon), who had held a\r\nhigh place, as well in the service as in the confidence of his Majesty,\r\nto inquire whether, in his opinion, there were any means, and if so,\r\nwhat means, of forming a Government for his Majesty on the principle of\r\ncarrying into execution an extensive reform in the representation of the\r\npeople. Thus it appears that when his Majesty had the misfortune of\r\ndisagreeing with his servants, respecting the advice which had been\r\ntendered to him, he happened to have had so little communication with\r\nother men, and was so little acquainted with their opinions on public\r\naffairs, that he felt it necessary to send for my noble and learned\r\nfriend, who was out of the immediate line of politics, in order to\r\nobtain his assistance, and to seek for information at his hands. My\r\nnoble and learned friend came to me, and informed me of the difficulty\r\nof his Majesty's situation, and I considered it my duty to inquire from\r\nothers what their opinions were, because, I confess to your Lordships,\r\nI was equally unprepared with his Majesty for the consideration of such\r\na question.\r\n\r\nUpon inquiry, I found that a large number of friends of mine were not\r\nunwilling to give confidence and support to a government formed upon\r\nsuch a principle, and with the positive view of resistance to that\r\nadvice which was tendered to his Majesty. Under these circumstances I\r\nwaited on his Majesty on Saturday, and submitted to him my advice. That\r\nadvice was not to re-appoint his late ministry, nor was it to appoint\r\nmyself. I did not look to any objects of ambition. I advised him to seek\r\nthe assistance of other persons well qualified to fill the high\r\nsituations in the state, expressing myself willing to give his Majesty\r\nevery assistance, whether in office or out of office, to enable his\r\nMajesty to form an administration to resist the advice which had been so\r\ngiven to him. My Lords, these were the first steps of the transaction;\r\nand if ever there was an instance in which the Sovereign acted more\r\nhonestly by his former servants--if ever there was an instance in which\r\npublic men kept themselves most completely apart from all intrigues, and\r\nfrom all indirect influence--using only those direct and honourable\r\nmeans of opposition, of which no man has reason to be other than proud,\r\nthis is that instance. And when I came to give my advice to his Majesty,\r\ninstead of advising him with a view to objects of personal ambition, as\r\nI have been accused of doing upon high authority,--I gave that advice\r\nwhich I thought would best lead to another arrangement, and I stated\r\nthat I was ready to serve his Majesty in any or in no capacity, so as\r\nbest to assist him in carrying on a government to resist the advice\r\nwhich had been given him by his late ministers. And here, my Lords, I\r\nbeg your Lordships to examine a little what was the nature of the advice\r\nwhich was tendered by his Majesty's ministers to his Majesty, which his\r\nMajesty thought proper not to follow, and which I considered it my\r\nbounden duty to enable his Majesty to resist. I do not ask any man to\r\nseek any further explanation of this advice, than that which was given\r\nby the ministers themselves. It was neither more nor less than this. The\r\nGovernment, feeling some difficulty in carrying the Reform Bill through\r\nthis House, were induced to advise his Majesty to do--what?--to create a\r\nsufficient number of peers to enable them to carry their measure, to\r\nforce it through this House of Parliament. Now, my Lords, before I go\r\nfurther, let me beg you to consider what is the nature of that\r\nproposition? Ministers found, in the course of last session, that there\r\nwas a large majority in this House against the principle of the bill.\r\nNow, my Lords, what is the ordinary course for a minister, under such\r\ncircumstances, to pursue? My Lords, it is to alter the measure, to\r\nendeavour to make it more palatable to that branch of the legislature\r\nwhich was opposed to it. Such is the usual course; but, in this case,\r\nthe minister says \"no. I will next session bring in a bill as efficient\r\nas that which has been rejected.\" And what did he do? My Lords, I have\r\nno hesitation in saying that, notwithstanding the opposition of this\r\nHouse, he brought in a measure stronger and worse than any of the\r\nmeasures before introduced; and this measure he wishes to force upon the\r\nHouse by a large creation of peers. How many peers, it is not necessary\r\nto state--it has not even been stated, by the noble Lords opposite: it\r\nis enough to say, a sufficient number to force the Reform Bill through\r\nthe House. It is only necessary for me to state the proposition. If this\r\nbe a legal and constitutional course of conduct--if such projects can be\r\ncarried into execution by a minister of the crown with impunity--there\r\nis no doubt that the constitution of this House and of this country is\r\nat an end. I ask, my Lords, is there any body blind enough not to see\r\nthat if a minister can, with impunity, advise his Sovereign to such an\r\nunconstitutional exercise of his prerogative as to thereby decide all\r\nquestions in this House, there is absolutely an end put to the power and\r\nobjects of deliberation in this House--an end to all means of decision;\r\nI say, then, my Lords, thinking as I do, it was my duty to counsel his\r\nMajesty to resist the following of this advice; and, my Lords, my\r\nopinion is that the threat of carrying this measure of creation into\r\nexecution, if it should have the effect of inducing noble Lords to\r\nabsent themselves from the House, or to adopt any particular line of\r\nconduct, is just as bad as its execution; for, my Lords, it does by\r\nviolence force a decision on this House--and on a subject, my Lords, on\r\nwhich this House is not disposed to give such a decision. It is true, my\r\nLords, men may be led to adopt such a course, by reflecting, that if\r\nthey do not adopt it, some 50 or 100 peers will be introduced, and thus\r\ndeliberation and decision in this House be rendered impracticable; or\r\nmen may be led to adopt it with the view of saving the Sovereign from\r\nthe indignity of having so gross an alternative imposed upon him. But I\r\nsay, my Lords, that the effect of any body of men agreeing publicly to\r\nsuch a course, will be to make themselves parties to this very\r\nproceeding, of which I say, we have so much reason to complain. The only\r\ncourse of proceeding at this eventful crisis, worthy of the men with\r\nwhom I have the honour to be connected, was to advise his Majesty--was\r\nto counsel his Majesty--to resist the advice which had been given him,\r\nif he could find means of carrying on the government of the country\r\nwithout acceding to it. But this part of the transaction, my Lords,\r\nrequires particular explanation upon my part--his Majesty insisted that\r\nsome \"extensive measure of reform\" (I use his own words) \"in the\r\nrepresentation of the people\" should be carried. I always was of\r\nopinion, and am still of opinion, that the measure of reform is\r\nunnecessary, and will prove most injurious to the country. But on the\r\nlast occasion when I addressed your Lordships,--in the committee on\r\nMonday se'nnight,--I stated my intention to endeavour to amend the bill\r\nin committee, and to do it honestly and fairly. Still, however, I\r\nthought that, amend it as we might in committee, it was not a measure\r\nwhich would enable the country to have a government capable of\r\nencountering the critical circumstances and serious difficulties to\r\nwhich every man must expect this country to be exposed. This was, my\r\nLords,--this is, my opinion. I do not think that, under the influence of\r\nthis measure, it is possible that any government can expect to overcome\r\nthe dangers to which this country must be exposed. But my Lords, this\r\nwas not the question before me; I was called on to assist my Sovereign\r\nin resisting a measure which would lead to the immediate overthrow of\r\none branch of the legislature--a measure which would enable the ministry\r\nto carry through this house the whole bill unmodified, unimproved, and\r\nunmitigated. I had then, my Lords, only the choice of adopting such part\r\nof that bill as this house might please to send down to the House of\r\nCommons, suffering the government hereafter to depend upon the operation\r\nof that part of the bill rather than upon the whole bill, or else of\r\nsuffering the whole bill to be carried, and the House of Lords to be\r\ndestroyed. My Lords, my opinion is not altered; no part of the bill is\r\nsafe; but undoubtedly, a part of the bill is better, that is to say,\r\nless injurious, than the whole bill; and, certainly, it must at least be\r\nadmitted that it is better than the destruction of the constitution of\r\nthe country by the destruction of the independence of this house. Under\r\nthese circumstances, my Lords, I gave my consent to assist his Majesty\r\nin forming a new government. I know many may be of opinion that I should\r\nhave acted a more prudent part if I had looked to anterior\r\ncircumstances, and if I had regarded the opinions and pledges I had\r\ngiven, and if, placing my attention exclusively upon the desire of\r\nacting a consistent part in public life, I had pursued a different\r\ncourse, and refused my assistance to his Majesty, I should have done\r\nbetter and more wisely.\r\n\r\nI do not mean to detract from the merits of those who thought proper to\r\npursue a course contrary to mine upon the occasion. I am grieved that it\r\nshould have been my misfortune to differ with some right honourable\r\nfriends of mine, with whom I have been for many years in habits of\r\ncordial union, co-operation, and friendship, and from whom I hope this\r\nmomentary separation will not dissever me. Nay, my lords, their position\r\nwas different from mine. I was situated in a position very different\r\nfrom that in which they felt themselves to stand. They regretted that\r\nthey could not take the same course with me; but for myself, my Lords, I\r\ncannot help feeling that, if I had been capable of refusing my\r\nassistance to his Majesty--if I had been capable of saying to his\r\nMajesty, \"I cannot assist you in this affair, because I have, in my\r\nplace in parliament, expressed strong opinions against a measure to\r\nwhich your Majesty is friendly,\" I do not think I could have shewn my\r\nface in the streets for shame of having done it--for shame of having\r\nabandoned my Sovereign under such distressing circumstances. I have,\r\nindeed, the misfortune of differing from many noble Lords, but I cannot\r\nregret the steps I have taken. If I have made a mistake, I regret it;\r\nbut I am not aware that I have made any mistake. It was impossible that\r\nI could shrink from his Majesty in the distressing circumstances under\r\nwhich he was placed. I will not detain your Lordships longer with a\r\ndetail of the circumstances which led to the dilemma in which we are now\r\nplaced. But, my Lords, if you will only look back to the commencement of\r\nthose transactions--if you look to the speech which his Majesty made\r\nfrom the throne to this and the other house of Parliament, in June\r\n1831,--if you recollect that his Majesty stated, in very strong terms,\r\nthat that important question should receive the earliest and most\r\nattentive consideration, saying, \"--Having had recourse to that measure\r\nfor the purpose of ascertaining the sense of my people on the expediency\r\nof a reform in the representation, I have now to recommend that\r\nimportant question to your earliest and most attentive consideration,\r\nconfident that, in any measure which you may propose for its adjustment,\r\nyou will carefully adhere to the acknowledged principles of the\r\nconstitution, by which the prerogatives of the Crown, the authority of\r\nboth Houses of Parliament, and the rights and liberties of the people,\r\nare equally secured.\"\r\n\r\nNow, my Lords, I ask, could it be believed, at the time his Majesty made\r\nthis speech, that the rights of this house--the power of deliberating\r\nand deciding independently upon such a question as this--would be\r\ndestroyed by a creation of Peers, and by a creation to an extent which\r\ncould not be much less than one hundred? If any man at the time foretold\r\nthis, it would have been said he was dreaming of things that were\r\nimpossible. But to this state, my Lords, have we been brought by this\r\nmeasure. When I first heard of this bill being proposed to be carried by\r\na creation of Peers, I said it was absolutely impossible. I could not\r\nbelieve that any minister of England would be led by any considerations\r\nwhatsoever to recommend such a measure to his Majesty. The first time,\r\nindeed, I heard the matter mentioned with any degree of authority, was\r\nwhen a Right Rev. Prelate thought proper to write upon the subject to\r\nsome people in a town in the county of Sussex. I could appeal to those\r\nsitting near me if this be not the fact--if I did not uniformly declare\r\nthat the thing was impossible--that the very idea of it ought not to be\r\nmentioned. That it should never be imagined that any minister could be\r\nfound who would recommend such an unconstitutional--such a ruinous--such\r\nan unjust exercise of the prerogative of the crown; for, my Lords, I do\r\nmaintain that the just exercise of the prerogative of the Crown does by\r\nno means go to the extent of enabling his Majesty to create a body of\r\nPeers with the view to carry any particular measure. Under the\r\ncircumstances, then, I think your Lordships will not think it unnatural,\r\nwhen I consider his Majesty's situation, that I should endeavour to\r\nassist his Majesty to avoid the adoption of such a recommendation. But,\r\nmy Lords, when I found that in consequence of the discussions on Monday\r\nin another place,--which by the way proved so clearly what the\r\nsentiments of the leading men then were, that Peers should not be\r\ncreated for such a purpose:--when I found from these discussions that it\r\nwas impossible to form a government from that house, of such a nature as\r\nwould secure the confidence of the country, I felt it my duty to inform\r\nhis Majesty that I could not fulfil the commission with which he was\r\npleased to honour me, and his Majesty informed me that he would renew\r\nhis communications with his former ministry.\r\n\r\n_May 17, 1832._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The state of Ireland under Lord Grey, a Conspiracy against Law and\r\nGovernment._\r\n\r\nThe noble Lords at the head of the Irish government have a most\r\nparticular objection to these extraordinary measures, adopted to enable\r\nthe government to afford protection to the lives and property of his\r\nMajesty's subjects. If I do not mistake--and I am sure that I am in the\r\nrecollection of many noble Lords present--I myself reminded the noble\r\nEarl that the association act would terminate at the end of the session\r\nof Parliament of 1831; and the answer of the noble Earl was, that it was\r\nintended to bring in a bill to continue that act. My Lords, Parliament\r\nwas dissolved unfortunately, and the association act was not only not\r\ncontinued, but the convictions which had already taken place under it\r\nwere not carried into execution.\r\n\r\nIt might naturally be supposed that, when the Lord Lieutenant found that\r\nhe could not give protection to his Majesty's subjects even when he had\r\nthe association act, it would, at least, have been continued. No such\r\nthing. When Parliament reassembled, the question was again put by one of\r\nthe noble Lords near me, whether it was intended to propose a renewal of\r\nthat act; and the answer was, that the noble Lord at the head of the\r\nIrish government thought that he would tranquillize the country without\r\nhaving recourse to extraordinary measures. From that day to this there\r\nhas been no security to property--no security for person; there has been\r\nno enjoyment of peace or tranquillity in Ireland. That is the state in\r\nwhich it has continued from that time to the present. Now, my noble\r\nfriend stated most truly that this is the result of a conspiracy; I say\r\nthe same; and before I sit down, I will prove that it is a conspiracy,\r\nand nothing but a conspiracy, which tends to deprive a large class of\r\nhis Majesty's subjects of their property,--which renders their lives\r\ninsecure,--a conspiracy which tends to the overthrow of all government,\r\nif they do not adopt some measure to put it down. On this ground alone I\r\naddress your Lordships; I wish to warn the people and the government of\r\nthe real nature of that which exists in that part of the United Kingdom.\r\nWe have heard of an attempt, which was lately made by a clergyman, to\r\navail himself of a sale under a distress, for the purpose of obtaining\r\npayment of a part of what was his due. A body of troops were assembled,\r\nby direction of the magistrates, for the purpose of protecting the sale.\r\nIt appears, from an account of a nature usually tolerably accurate,\r\nthat, on the first day appointed for the sale, an assemblage of 20,000\r\npeople collected together; on the second day the number was 50,000; and\r\non the third it amounted to 100,000. I will take an unit from each of\r\nthese numbers, and even then I defy any man to shew me how that body\r\ncould have been assembled but by a conspiracy. Who led them there? My\r\nLords, the Priests. I have seen a letter from an officer who commanded\r\none of the bodies of troops employed on the occasion, in which such is\r\nstated to be the fact.\r\n\r\nWhen, my Lords, I know that that conspiracy exists, and that it goes to\r\nprevent a large proportion of his Majesty's subjects from enjoying their\r\nproperty--when I know that the same conspiracy may be applied to any\r\nother description of property--to any man's life, to his house, to his\r\nhonour, or to anything else that is most dear to man, I do say, it\r\nbecomes the noble Earl at the head of his Majesty's Government to adopt\r\nsome measures, in order to do that which Government can do, to get the\r\nbetter of that conspiracy. It must not be said that, under the British\r\nConstitution, there is no power to prevent such a conspiracy: I say,\r\nthere is a power, and that power resides in Parliament, which can give\r\nthe Government, under this best of all Constitutions, the means which\r\nshall at the same time protect the property and the liberty of every\r\nindividual in the state. Yes, my Lords, Parliament possesses the power\r\nto bestow on the Government the means of putting down this conspiracy--a\r\nconspiracy not against the Government itself, but against those whom the\r\nGovernment is bound in honour to protect. I take this question of tithes\r\nto be one of the most serious questions that can be brought under the\r\nconsideration of Parliament. I do not object to the noble Earl's\r\nmeasure--indeed, I really do not know what that measure is--but what I\r\nsay is, that the noble Earl is bound, and the King is bound by his oath,\r\nto protect the property of the Church--yes, his Majesty is sworn\r\nespecially to protect that property. But it is not the property of the\r\nChurch alone--what do you say of the lay impropriator? Is a man to be\r\nrobbed and ruined, because he possesses property in tithe?\r\n\r\nThere is no public grievance in Ireland. Tithes are no public grievance.\r\nTithes are private property, which a deep laid conspiracy is attempting\r\nto destroy. The noble Lord knows that he cannot get the better of it. I\r\ntell the noble Lord that he will be, at last, obliged to come to\r\nParliament for a measure to enable him to put down the conspirators. I\r\nrecollect the famous affair at Manchester; and remember perfectly well\r\nto have heard a most able and eloquent speech made by the noble and\r\nlearned Lord in another place, upon the subject of collecting large\r\nnumbers of persons together; and I well remember his able and eloquent\r\njustification of the magistrates for the part they assumed upon that\r\noccasion. I want to know why the magistrates at Carlow and at Cork did\r\nnot obtain the same support when pursuing a similar course? I know I\r\nshall be told in answer to this, that I am a person very desirous of\r\nspilling blood. My Lords, I am not recommending the spilling of blood; I\r\nwant to save human life by Legislative means. I do not want to have\r\nrecourse to arms against crowds and mobs of people; but what I want is,\r\nthat the real conspirators should be got the better of, and not that the\r\nmere instruments and victims of their wicked work should be punished.\r\nBut if the course pursued at Manchester against the collection of large\r\nbodies of armed people was correct--if the attack was rightly made upon\r\nthose armed people--I want to know why the same was not done at Cork and\r\nat Carlow, where the troops stood in the midst of the people three days,\r\nwho at last were suffered to carry off the distress, without the\r\nclergyman being able to satisfy his claim?\r\n\r\nThe noble Lord has said, that Ireland is in a state of great\r\ntranquillity. Now, I certainly must say, that as far as I have heard, I\r\ncannot believe in the existence of that tranquillity. It may be\r\nperfectly true, by moving a large body of troops from the country into a\r\nparticular district, together with a great number of police and\r\nmagistrates, that, for a moment, tranquillity may be restored to that\r\ndistrict; but there is no gentleman in the country feels himself in a\r\nstate of security. There is, however, one test, to which I wish to\r\nbring the noble Secretary of State. I want to know this--has he, in any\r\none case, carried into execution the provisions of the Tithe Act? Is\r\nthere a single instance of any tithe having been collected by Government\r\nunder that Act? If the clergy are to be paid out of the Consolidated\r\nFund, and that Act is not to be enforced, I must say that the noble Lord\r\nmay make what boast he pleases as to the state of Ireland; but there is\r\nno man who will believe one word about the tranquillity of Ireland,\r\nuntil the noble Lord can produce evidence of the collection of some\r\ntithes under that Act.\r\n\r\nWhat I want to see is, the affording of some security to property--some\r\nprotection to life; and that some assurance should be given to the peace\r\nof the country being established and preserved.\r\n\r\n_July 3, 1832._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Necessity of conciliating the Protestants of Ireland._\r\n\r\nI come now, my Lords, to that part of the subject which is certainly\r\nvery painful to me, because I conceive it to be that in which I may say\r\nthe Government has been much to blame; and that is, their treatment of\r\nthe Protestant Church of Ireland. My opinion is, that in the treatment\r\nof that Church they have certainly thrown the Protestants of Ireland\r\nentirely aside. There is no doubt whatever that the Protestants, who,\r\nlike other classes of men, were more or less divided amongst themselves,\r\nare now nearly unanimous in their opinions upon the subject of the\r\nGovernment. They are nearly all of them, at the present moment, opposed\r\nto the Government--irritated by a strong sense of the injury done to\r\nthem, and the insecurity of their situation, which is certainly most\r\npainful to everybody who wishes well to the union between the two\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n_July 3, 1832._\r\n\r\n_The Church should Educate the People._\r\n\r\nWe have the Established Church--we have the Established clergy; and the\r\nwhole law of the country is, that the clergy of the Established Church\r\nshould have the charge of the education of the people, particularly of\r\nIreland. But, under the proposed system, the schoolmaster is simply to\r\nteach the obligations which are due to society from every individual,\r\nand the pupil is not to refer to divine authority for those\r\nobligations--he is not without permission to refer to that alone which\r\ncan render those obligations binding.\r\n\r\nJuly 3,1832.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The Duke of Wellington's Government opposed to the Appointment of Otho\r\nas King of Greece._\r\n\r\nThe late government were no parties to the selection of Prince Otho; on\r\nthe contrary, he was a person to whose appointment they had objected, as\r\nappears on the face of the protocols; and the objection exists at the\r\npresent moment, though not to such an extent as it did, a year and a\r\nhalf having elapsed since it was first made. I object to the\r\narrangement now, because the interests of this country have been\r\nessentially altered in the Mediterranean. His Majesty has now essential\r\nduties to perform in the Adriatic. When I see France remaining in\r\npossession of Algiers, notwithstanding the provisions of the treaty, and\r\nwhen I observe what has been done by her at Ancona, I must say the\r\ninterests of this country have been grossly neglected in that quarter.\r\nJuly 18, 1832\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The giving the Town-franchise to the Catholics, will lead to the\r\nDestruction of the Protestant Church._\r\n\r\nThe reason assigned for getting rid of the freemen is, because they\r\nwould support the Protestant interest in towns. Now, I have no\r\nhesitation whatever in stating, that the interest connected with the\r\nChurch and the Protestant institutions of the country must give way it\r\nthe franchise is transferred into the hands of the Roman Catholic\r\npopulation. It is easy to say that there ought to be no difference\r\nbetween Roman Catholics and Protestants. I wish to God it could be so;\r\nbut the circumstances of Ireland are such as to render it necessary,\r\nthat a counterpoise should be given to counteract the influence which\r\nthe Roman Catholics will acquire by the bill. I wish to carry the\r\nprinciples of 1829 into effect, and that can not be done if both parties\r\nare placed upon an equal footing. I think it most unfair to give the\r\nCatholic population of towns the power of returning Roman Catholic\r\nMembers of Parliament; and I shall, therefore, seeing that the rights of\r\nfreemen are to be abolished, object to the 40s. freeholders being\r\nretained.\r\n\r\nJuly 20, 1832\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The Albocracy._\r\n\r\nIn this country (India), as in all others, there are certain established\r\nqualifications for justices of the peace and for jurymen, and no\r\ndisqualification, in any part of the world, is equal to that of colour.\r\nThe white man has an influence which the black man has not. This\r\ndistinction prevails most in those countries in which a liberal system\r\nof Government has been established, as in the United States of America,\r\nand the various states existing in the southern portion of that\r\ncontinent. Indeed, a term has been invented to designate it in Columbia,\r\nin which express laws have been made for the support and maintenance of\r\nthe \"Albocracy.\"\r\n\r\n_August_ 14, 1832.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Effect of the Savings of the Grey Government_.\r\n\r\nI give the noble Earl at the head of his Majesty's Government full\r\ncredit for the diminution in the expenses of the country which has been\r\neffected by the Government, but I cannot help thinking that such\r\ndiminutions will prove to be generally detrimental to the country,\r\ninasmuch as they are effected merely for the purpose of meeting a\r\ndeficiency in the revenue for the moment. But the fact is, that many of\r\nthese reductions are applicable to the army, to the navy, to the\r\nmilitia, and other most essential services of the country, which,\r\nalthough not estimated for this year, must be provided for at a future\r\nperiod. For instance, one branch of these savings is that for training\r\nthe militia; the saving, under this head, is 190,000 l.; but it is quite\r\nclear that this sum must again be expended when the militia shall be\r\ntrained in future years. Another saving is that of freight, transport,\r\nand provisions of soldiers from one part of the world to another. Now,\r\nit is very true, that during the present year this reduction may be\r\nmade, because it does not happen that the change of regiments in the\r\nWest India colonies and India takes place; but such will not be the case\r\nin another year, and the expenditure of 45,000 l. on that head, which\r\ndoes not appear in these estimates, must again occur.\r\n\r\nAnother item of reduction is in the purchase of timber for the navy\r\nservice, which amounts to the very considerable sum of 400,000 l. It is\r\nevident that the magazines of this country must be kept up, and all that\r\nis really done by this apparent saving, is to throw the burden, to this\r\nextent, on future years. With a view to a secure and adequate supply,\r\nand to the proper seasoning of stores, and with a view to the\r\nprobability that it may become necessary for his Majesty's service to\r\nmake some great exertion, it is impossible that less than double the\r\namount of the estimate of the present year under this head, can\r\npermanently suffice. Now, it is impossible to look upon these savings in\r\nany other light than as temporary, and I will go so far as to say that\r\nit would have been a much better principle of economy to spend this\r\nmoney than to save it, if the distressed state of the finances had not\r\nabsolutely required the reduction of the expenditure. But I cannot help\r\ntaking another view of the subject. It is necessary for the country, and\r\nessential to the character of the Government, that they should look\r\nbeyond a mere balance of income and expenditure, with a view to be\r\nprepared for unforeseen emergencies which may arise. Can any body say,\r\nthat the Government is now left in the situation in which it ought to be\r\nleft with respect to finances? This is the last session of the present\r\nParliament. A reformed Parliament will meet next session, and it is\r\nimpossible for any man to say what will be the conduct of that\r\nParliament with respect to finance. But this is not the only ground on\r\nwhich it is desirable that the finances of the country should be in a\r\nmore satisfactory state.\r\n\r\nI say, my Lords, that I regard these financial difficulties with the\r\ngreater apprehension, when I remember that occasions may arise, and are\r\nin fact, likely to arise, in which it may be necessary for his Majesty\r\nto call forth all the resources of the country. When I look to the state\r\nof Ireland, when I turn my attention to our foreign relations, and above\r\nall, when I call to mind the present condition of the Peninsula, I find\r\nit impossible to shut my eyes to the alarming truth, that events are on\r\nthe eve of occurring, which may call forth to the utmost, every\r\nexertion which Englishmen are capable of making, and may demand, as I\r\nhave said before, all the resources of the empire.\r\n\r\n_August_ 15, 1832.\r\n\r\n_Policy of the Wellington Administration towards Portugal_.\r\n\r\nThe noble Earl (Grey) has stated, that the late government was the cause\r\nof the usurpation of Don Miguel. Now that is a mistake in point of time;\r\nfor it will be found that Don Miguel was brought to Portugal, when the\r\nnoble Viscount opposite, (Viscount Goderich) was at the head of the\r\ngovernment. It is true that I was in office when Don Miguel landed in\r\nPortugal, and when he usurped the government over which he was placed as\r\nRegent. The noble Earl has stated, that at that time the British army\r\nwas there, and might have prevented the usurpation. I deny the fact; the\r\nBritish Army had been withdrawn before the usurpation. It is true that,\r\nbefore the army was withdrawn, Miguel had dissolved the Chambers, and\r\nhad given indications that it was not his intention to carry into effect\r\nthe constitution of the country; but he had given no indication of a\r\nresolution to usurp the Sovereign power; and that usurpation was\r\noccasioned by a decree of the Cortes, acquired for that purpose. In\r\npoint of fact the army was withdrawn; and even if it had not been\r\nwithdrawn, what was its force? Why it only amounted to 5,000 men, which\r\nwould not have been enough to effect anything. I deny therefore, that\r\nthe government has been the cause of the usurpation. When Don Miguel did\r\nusurp the sovereign authority, the late government did all they could;\r\nthey ceased their diplomatic relations with Portugal, and then brought\r\naway the minister from thence.\r\n\r\nThen the noble Earl says, that the state of things just mentioned\r\nexisted when he came into office; and that the late government was\r\nwilling to recognize Don Miguel, provided he would grant a general\r\namnesty. The noble Earl has omitted to state all. It would have been\r\nfair, had the noble Earl stated what had previously occurred. The first\r\nthing we did was to advise a reconciliation between the two branches of\r\nthe House of Braganza, and we referred the question to Brazil. The\r\nEmperor of Brazil was perfectly ready to go to war if we would make war\r\nfor him, but he would not go to war himself, because, in fact he had no\r\nresources of his own to do so. What then became our duty? Our duty was\r\nto place Portugal in the society of nations as soon as we could, and to\r\nendeavour to induce Don Miguel to do that which would have the effect of\r\nattaining that object. For that purpose, we called on Don Miguel to\r\nreconcile the country to him, by some act of grace towards those who had\r\nbeen connected with the former government of the country. But it is not\r\ntrue that we desired to impose any condition with respect to that act\r\nof grace. The principle on which we invariably acted was to make an act\r\nof amnesty be given without any condition whatever, because it was our\r\nwish not to interfere in any manner whatever with the government of\r\nPortugal; and it would have been interfering, had we made any condition\r\nwhich we might have been afterwards called upon to enforce. We would not\r\nmake ourselves responsible for that amnesty. We urged him repeatedly to\r\ngrant it, and if he had done so, he would most undoubtedly have been\r\nrecognized; and we fully expected, when that paragraph was inserted in\r\nthe King's Speech, that he would have given the amnesty, and have\r\nenabled us to recognize him. I have no hesitation in saying, that I was\r\nexceedingly anxious at that time to recognize this Prince, not because I\r\ndisputed the claim or right of the other branch of the House of\r\nBraganza, nor because I ventured to decide upon that right, but I wanted\r\nto do that which was done by the government of this country in a similar\r\ncase with respect to France,--I wanted to recognize the authority of the\r\nking _de facto_, in order to enable him to carry on the government of\r\nthe country with advantage, not only to himself, and his country, but\r\nalso to Europe. If I had remained in office much longer, I would have\r\ndone it in order to remove from that country, and from Europe, the\r\ninconveniences which have resulted from the existing state of things in\r\nPortugal. It was not done before, because the amnesty was not given.\r\n\r\nMuch has been said about the cruelty of this Prince, and the hatred\r\nborne towards him by the people of Portugal; but I think there has been\r\nsome extraordinary exaggeration upon that subject. The noble Earl states\r\nthat we left things in this state when he left office. It is perfectly\r\ntrue; but we have, over and over again, pressed upon the noble Earl the\r\nnecessity of taking Portugal out of the state in which it was placed,\r\nand of recognizing that government, with a view to prevent that state of\r\naffairs which has since come to puss. The Emperor of Brazil has no power\r\nto enter into a war in favor of his daughter, nor can she be put in\r\npossession of Portugal, except by revolutionary means,--namely, by\r\nemploying bands of adventurers, collected in various quarters, and paid\r\nby God knows whom.\r\n\r\n_August_ 15, 1832.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The Civil War in Portugal fomented by Earl Grey's Government_.\r\n\r\nI believe if there be any country in the world in which it is both the\r\nduty and interest of England to prevent the existence of hostilities,\r\nthat country is Portugal. We are bound by treaties to defend her, as she\r\nis, in case of need, to defend England. It is affirmed that we are under\r\nengagements to preserve a strict neutrality towards the two Princes now\r\nopposed to each other in Portugal; but we are bound in honour and good\r\npolicy to protect that country, in which his Majesty's subjects have\r\nsuch interests invested, and with which they carry on such extensive\r\ncommerce: yet the present government have hazarded all these interests\r\nby permitting this war to be carried on there by a foreign power. The\r\nking, in his speech, calls it, indeed, a \"civil war.\" My Lords, it is a\r\nrevolutionary war--a war carried on by means furnished in this town, and\r\nfor the advance of which the inducement is the hope of plunder. It is\r\ncarried on by persons who have no interest in the war excepting plunder.\r\nYet this is the war which his Majesty has been advised by his servants\r\nto call, upon the assembling of his parliament, \"a civil war between the\r\ntwo branches of the house of Braganza in Portugal.\" The king is made, by\r\nhis Ministers, to declare that he is anxiously desirous to put an end to\r\nthis war. \"I shall not fail to avail myself of any opportunity that may\r\nbe afforded me to assist in restoring peace to a country with which the\r\ninterests of my dominions are so intimately connected.\" Now, I know\r\nsomething of war, and I know something of war in that country; and I\r\nwill tell noble Lords how they can put an end to it at once. Let them\r\nput forth a proclamation recalling his Majesty's subjects from the\r\nservice of both parties engaged in the contest,--let them, at the same\r\ntime, carry into execution the law of the country; let them, when the\r\ncommissioners of the customs, in the execution of their exclusive duty,\r\nseize vessels carrying out troops, ammunition and officers, who, I am\r\nable to prove, are at this moment serving in those armies, leave the\r\nadjudication of such seizures to the proper tribunals; and let not the\r\nKing's ministers interfere, and let them employ the British fleet in the\r\nLevant, and other places, to which the attention of his Majesty's\r\ngovernment ought to be directed, instead of being employed in watching\r\nthe shores of the Douro and the Tagus--let them do all this, and they\r\nwill soon find that peace will be restored to Portugal without any\r\nfurther sacrifice. But I am sorry to say these are not the measures\r\nadopted by his Majesty's government, nor is the law carried into\r\nexecution by that government. My Lords, I engage to prove, that though\r\nthe commissioners of the customs did, in the autumn of 1831, detain\r\ncertain vessels in the Thames, having on board the very troops,\r\nammunition, and arms which have been since employed in this war; and\r\nalthough these commissioners are, by the act of parliament, the persons\r\nappointed to carry it into execution,--they were ordered, by a superior\r\npower, not to interfere.\r\n\r\n_February_ 5, 1833.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Don Miguel de facto King of Portugal_.\r\n\r\nDon Miguel having been appointed Sovereign by the Cortes, it was not the\r\nbusiness of the British government to offer any opposition to their\r\nchoice; and as long as we continued in office, we were seeking for the\r\nmeans of recognizing Don Miguel as Sovereign, _de facto_, of Portugal.\r\nIn point of fact, I have no doubt, if we had remained in office a\r\nfortnight longer, we should have effected that recognition; for it was\r\nnever intended to make the proposed amnesty an indispensable condition\r\nof that step. Our object in recognizing him, was to prevent those\r\ndisasters which I apprehended must arise from the conflict of extreme\r\nopinions in the Peninsula.\r\n\r\n_February_ 5, 1833.\r\n\r\n_The Catholic Oath is a Principle_.\r\n\r\nHis Majesty has sworn to maintain the established Church of England in\r\nIreland; and secondly, that in the very last arrangements made to remove\r\nthe disabilities, as well of the Dissenters from the church of England\r\nas of the Roman Catholics of Ireland, words were inserted in the oaths\r\nto be taken by them, for the security of the Protestant establishment. I\r\nconsider those oaths as principles; and that we ought not to run counter\r\nto them in any manner whatever.\r\n\r\n_February_ 5, 1833.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Protestants of Ireland are the friends of order in Ireland, and they\r\nare the natural friends and connections of England. I entreat you never\r\nto lose sight of this important truth.\r\n\r\n_February_ 5, 1833.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The Game Laws increase Poaching_.\r\n\r\nSince the passing of the Game Act, poaching has enormously increased. It\r\nis consistent with my own knowledge, also, that as regards my own\r\nestate, until this law passed, there was little or no poaching upon it,\r\nbut that evil has greatly increased since that period. In fact, not long\r\nsince, I lost a servant in an affray with poachers, and I at once\r\ndetermined to give up preserving game; but I was induced to relinquish\r\nmy intention in consequence of learning that the keeper, whom I was\r\nabout to discharge, could not get employment in any other part of the\r\ncountry. This, alone, is the reason why I still preserve my game. I am\r\nthoroughly convinced that, in the neighbourhood in which I reside,\r\npoaching has increased threefold since the passing of the present Act. I\r\nthink that result is entirely owing to the circumstance that the person\r\nwho is in possession of the game is entitled to carry it away and sell\r\nit, and cannot be questioned as to the manner in which it came into his\r\npossession.\r\n\r\n_May 31, 1833._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Importance of Portugal to England._\r\n\r\nIf there be any nation in the world for which more than another this\r\ncountry feels--and justly feels--an interest, it is Portugal. The\r\nalliance between this country and Portugal is among the most ancient to\r\nbe found in the history of nations; it is an alliance repeatedly\r\nrecognised by all Europe; it is one from which this country has derived\r\nadvantage almost from a period beyond memory; and for the preservation\r\nof which, in better times than these, and in order to rescue that\r\ncountry out of the hands of her enemies, she has expended her best blood\r\nand treasure.\r\n\r\n_June 3, 1833._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The Emancipation Act of 1833 a Premature Measure_.\r\n\r\nIn the discussions on the abolition of the slave trade, it was more than\r\nonce declared by the advocates of that measure, that they had no\r\nintention of following it up by an attempt at the abolition of slavery;\r\nbut, on the contrary, those who contended most strenuously for the\r\nabolition of the slave trade, declared that it was not intended that it\r\nshould be followed up by the abolition of slavery in the colonies, but\r\nthat their intention was, by means of the abolition of the slave trade,\r\nto ameliorate the condition of the slaves, and improve the state of\r\nsociety in the colonies. But I will not believe, from all that I have\r\nheard and read, that even the most earnest advocates of the abolition of\r\nthe slave trade intended, immediately, to follow up the amelioration of\r\nthe condition of the slave, by the total abolition of slavery. That men\r\nshould look forward to the abolition of slavery in the colonies as\r\nconsequent on the improvement in the state of society, and the state of\r\nslavery, is probable; and there is no doubt that a great improvement has\r\nresulted from the abolition of the slave trade, coupled with the\r\nmeasure, but that the one step should be considered as an immediate\r\nconsequence of the other, I altogether deny; and I appeal with\r\nconfidence to the discussions which formerly took place.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn all countries, where it is proposed to make large bodies of slaves\r\nfree, the first thing that is described as necessary to be considered\r\nis, whether the country is in a condition to bear the change; the\r\nsecond, whether the slave whom it is proposed to constitute a freeman,\r\nwill work for hire? These are points with respect to which it has always\r\nbeen considered necessary to have full and convincing proof before\r\nemancipation should be granted. The noble Earl tells us that, in this\r\ninstance, there is no proof to the contrary. I think that there is proof\r\nto the contrary. We have heard of the adoption of a measure of this\r\nnature within the province of Colombia. But supposing it to be true,\r\nthat 100,000 liberated negroes have shewn a disposition to labour, or\r\nhave actually laboured for hire in Colombia, still I contend that that\r\ncircumstance affords no proof whatever that the same results would\r\nfollow from the liberation 700,000 or 800,000 negroes in the British\r\npossessions. But I by no means concur with the noble Earl as to the\r\nsufficiency of the case of Colombia, as a case in point. I have the\r\nauthority of a very intelligent person, who was resident in Colombia at\r\nthe time that the transaction took place, and who, in writing upon the\r\nsubject, states positively that the experiment was a most dangerous one;\r\nand that although the liberated negroes laboured for awhile, yet that a\r\nfew years afterwards, they could not be got to work at all. This is\r\nfurther proved by the fact, that in the course of four or five years it\r\nwas found necessary to introduce a measure for the promotion of\r\nagriculture, which measure, it was admitted, was called for, in\r\nconsequence of the great difficulty that was found in getting the free\r\nnegroes to work.\r\n\r\n_June_ 23, 1833.\r\n\r\n_Difficulty of preventing free labour in the Colonies anticipated_.\r\n\r\nLook at our own colonies in tropical climates, and see whether you can\r\nfind any disposition in the free negro to work in the low grounds. If\r\nyou look at Surinam, or any other of the tropical climates, where free\r\nnegroes are to be found, you will find a total absence of any\r\ndisposition, on their part, to work for hire, or for any other\r\nconsideration whatever. But says the noble Earl, \"the negroes work in\r\nAfrica;\" of that fact, begging the noble Earl's pardon, I do not think\r\nhe can produce any proof; but even supposing that he could, I contend\r\nthat the fact does not bear upon this question--the question here is not\r\nwhether the negro, in a state of freedom, will work in Africa, but\r\nwhether, being made free, he will voluntarily labour in the low grounds\r\nin our possessions within the tropics? I say, that there is no proof of\r\nsuch labour on the part of negroes, in any part of the world. In one\r\nquarter of the globe, in which I have some knowledge, I am certainly\r\naware that men do labour very hard for hire in low grounds within the\r\ntropics; but those men are in a condition but little removed from\r\nabsolute slavery, because they are the lowest in a state of society,\r\nwhich from them upwards is divided into the strictest castes. But in our\r\nWest India possessions the case is very different; there, this\r\ndifficulty from the moment of their first discovery, to the present\r\nhour, has always existed; a difficulty arising from the circumstance,\r\nthat in those tropical climates, a man instead of working for hire,\r\nworks only for food,--and having obtained that food, which he can\r\nprocure by very little exertion, he thinks of nothing save the luxury of\r\nreposing in listless idleness beneath the shade. That is the great\r\ndifficulty which surrounds this question.\r\n\r\n_June_ 25, 1833.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Depressing the West India Colonies will lead to the Introduction of\r\nForeign Slave Grown Sugar_.\r\n\r\nSupposing that the growth of the sugar should, from the causes I have\r\nmentioned, fail in the West Indies, where are we to get sugar? We must\r\nget it no doubt from the colonies of other countries, where it is\r\nproduced by the labour of slaves. What then, will those who are so\r\nanxious for the abolition of slavery say, if, in consequence of this\r\nmeasure, the slave trade should be revived, with all the added horrors\r\nof its being carried on in a contraband manner; and if, instead of\r\ndecreasing the amount of slavery in the world, we should increase it, in\r\nCuba, and in the other foreign West India possessions, over which we\r\nhave no control, and into which it would be impossible for us to\r\nintroduce any measure, regulating or ameliorating the condition of the\r\nslave.\r\n\r\nAt this moment we consume more of sugar, even excluding Ireland, than\r\nall the rest of Europe put together; and I leave it to your Lordships to\r\nconsider whether it would be possible, under any circumstances whatever,\r\nthat this country could go on without a supply of that article. How can\r\nthat supply be furnished, supposing that the production in our colonies\r\nshould fail, except by the produce of slave labour from the colonies of\r\nother countries?\r\n\r\n_June_ 25, 1833.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_East India Company; Eulogium on its Administration_.\r\n\r\nHaving been so long a servant of the East India Company, whose interests\r\nyou are discussing, having served for so many years of my life in that\r\ncountry, having had such opportunities of personally watching the\r\noperation of the government of that country, and having had reason to\r\nbelieve, both from what I saw at that time, and from what I have seen\r\nsince, that the Government of India was at that time, one of the best\r\nand most purely administered governments that ever existed, and one\r\nwhich has provided most effectually for the happiness of the people over\r\nwhich it is placed, it is impossible that I should be present when a\r\nquestion of this description is discussed, without asking your\r\nLordships' attention for a very short time whilst I deliver my opinion\r\nupon the plan which his Majesty's ministers have brought forward. I will\r\nnot follow the noble Marquis who opened the debate, into the\r\nconsideration of whether a chartered company be the best, or not,\r\ncalculated to carry on the government or the trade of an empire like\r\nIndia, that is not the question to which I wish now to apply myself. But\r\nwhenever I hear of such discussions as this, I recall to my memory what\r\nI have seen in that country--I recall to my memory the history of that\r\ncountry for the last fifty or sixty years. I remember its days of\r\nmisfortune, and its days of glory, and call to mind the situation in\r\nwhich it now stands. I remember that the government have conducted the\r\naffairs of--I will not pretend to say how many millions of people,--they\r\nhave been calculated at 70,000,000, 80,000,000, 90,000,000, and\r\n100,000,000--but certainly of an immense population, a population\r\nreturning an annual revenue of 20,000,000 l. sterling, and that\r\nnotwithstanding all the wars in which the empire has been engaged its\r\ndebt at this moment amounts only to 40,000,000 l., being no more than the\r\namount of two years revenue. I do not say that such a debt is desirable;\r\nbut at the same time I contend that it is a delusion on the people of\r\nthis country to tell them that that is a body unfit for government, and\r\nunfit for trade, which has administered the affairs of India with so\r\nmuch success for so many years, and which is at length to be put\r\ndown,--for I can use no other term,--upon the ground that it is an\r\ninstitution calculated for the purposes neither of government nor trade.\r\n\r\nMy Lords, there is a great difference between the East India Company\r\ngoverning India, and carrying on their trade with China as a joint-stock\r\ncompany, and carrying on the same trade as monopolists. It was my\r\nopinion, and the opinion of those who acted with me, that we ought, in\r\nthe first instance, at all events, to have endeavoured to have prevailed\r\nupon them to continue trading with China as a joint-stock company. If at\r\nthis moment, they had chosen to have continued to trade as a joint stock\r\ncompany, I would have allowed them; I would have adopted measures for\r\nthe purpose of inducing them to do so, and to carry on the government of\r\nIndia. It is perfectly true, my Lords, that the people of this country\r\nwere, and are, desirous of participating in the trade to China; but I am\r\nnot aware that they ever expressed a desire to see the company deprived\r\nof any branch of that trade. But then, my Lords, the noble Lord asks,\r\n\"how would you secure to them their dividends?\" Why, my Lords, their\r\ndividends, supposing the trade had turned out so ill as the noble Lord\r\nexpects it would have done, would have been secured to them, as they\r\nmust be at present, by saving all unnecessary expense in India--those\r\ndividends would have been secured to them, as they still will be, and as\r\nunder all circumstances they must be, by bringing down the whole\r\nexpences of the Government of the country. But we had another\r\nresource--we might have relieved the East India Company, trading to\r\nChina no longer as a monopolist, but as a joint stock company, from a\r\npart of the burden of the provisions of the Commutation Act. I cannot\r\nhelp thinking, if that course had been adopted--or even supposing,\r\naccording to the calculations of my noble Friend behind me, we had been\r\nobliged to abandon that course, by desiring the East India Company to\r\nwithdraw from trading with China--that they still would have been in\r\npossession of their capital, which might have been disposed of for their\r\nadvantage, and they might have been continued in the Government of\r\nIndia. I entreat your Lordships to observe, that such an arrangement\r\nwould have been attended with this advantage, that they would not have\r\nhad to draw their dividends from India. One of the greatest\r\ninconveniences attending this arrangement is, in my opinion, the\r\nincreased sum which must be annually brought home by remittance to this\r\ncountry from India, to such an amount that the inconvenience is very\r\ngreat, so great, that I very much doubt whether the process can be\r\ncarried on; and it must be most prejudicial to the commerce of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n_June_ 5, 1833.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Reform un fait accompli_.\r\n\r\nNow that the Reform Bill has become the law of the land, I have\r\nconsidered it my duty not only to submit to it, but to endeavour to\r\ncarry its provisions into execution by every means in my power.\r\n\r\n_July_ 19, 1833.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Repudiation of the Holy Alliance_.\r\n\r\nI have passed part of my life in the foreign service of my country; but\r\nI most sincerely protest, that I never did join with any holy alliance\r\nagainst the liberties of Europe.\r\n\r\n_July_ 19, 1833.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Expediency and Principle_.\r\n\r\nIf the world were governed by principles, nothing would be more easy\r\nthan to conduct even the greatest affairs; but, in all circumstances,\r\nthe duty of a wise man is to choose the lesser of any two difficulties\r\nwhich beset him.\r\n\r\n_July_ 19, 1833.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Protestantism to be supported_.\r\n\r\nIt is our duty, in every case, to do all we can to promote the\r\nProtestant religion. It is our duty to do so, not only on account of the\r\npolitical relations between the religion of the Church of England and\r\nthe Government, but because we believe it to be the purest doctrine, and\r\nthe best system of religion, that can be offered to a people.\r\n\r\n_July_ 19, 1833.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Importance of preserving the authority of the East India Company_.\r\n\r\nThe noble Lord who spoke last, quoted the opinion of Sir John Malcolm.\r\nMy Lords, I wish the noble Lords opposite had taken the advice of Sir\r\nJohn Malcolm, upon the subject of forming an independent body in London,\r\nrepresenting the interests, and carrying on the concerns, of India. My\r\nLords, it is persons of this description who interpose an efficient\r\ncheck upon the Government. I say, therefore, that it is much to be\r\nlamented, that instead of placing that body in the state of independence\r\nin which they were heretofore placed, they are to be reduced to a\r\nsituation in which they will lose a very considerable portion of their\r\npower and influence. It is of the utmost importance that the greatest\r\npossible care should be taken to preserve the authority of the company\r\nin relation to their servants. Depend upon it, my Lords, that on the\r\nbasis of their authority depends the good government of India.\r\n\r\n_July_ 5, 1833.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_After Emancipation, the Protestants of Ireland ought to have been\r\nconciliated_.\r\n\r\nThe noble and learned Lord (Plunkett) said, that many of the evils that\r\nafflicted Ireland, and for which the Church Temporalities Bill was\r\nintended as a remedy, were occasioned by the delay of the measure of\r\nEmancipation, after the year 1825. Why, I ask, by its delay after the\r\nyear 1825? I beg to know from that noble and learned Lord how long the\r\nsystem of agitation existed in Ireland both before and after the year\r\n1825? Why, my Lords, it has existed ever since the commencement of the\r\ndiscussion of the Roman Catholic Question--that is to say, ever since\r\nthe days of the restrictive regency. From that period to the present\r\nmoment, there has been nothing but agitation, except during parts of the\r\nyears 1829 and 1830. Agitation commenced in Ireland upon the conclusion\r\nof events in Paris, and in Brussels. Those events occasioned such\r\nagitations and discussions as obliged the noble Duke, who was then at\r\nthe head of the Government in Ireland, to carry into execution the\r\nProclamation Act. Then came a change in the administration, and the\r\nnoble Earl assumed the reigns of power. He immediately chose for the\r\nLord Lieutenant (Lord Wellesley) a nobleman for whom I entertain great\r\nrespect but who certainly was nearly the last person who ought to have\r\nbeen selected for that office. After the Roman Catholic Question was\r\nsettled, what ought the government to have done? Most certainly they\r\nought to have done everything in their power to conciliate--whom? The\r\nProtestants of Ireland. Everything had already been granted to the Roman\r\nCatholics which they could possibly require; and the object of the\r\ngovernment ought to have been to conciliate the Protestants. But,\r\ninstead of that, the noble Earl sends over to that country, as Lord\r\nLieutenant, the noble Marquis, who was the very last person that ought\r\nto have been appointed; because, when holding that situation previously,\r\nand on receiving information that his Majesty's government entertained\r\nviews favourable to the emancipation of the Catholics, he did,\r\nimmediately, before his departure for Ireland, issue a sort of\r\nproclamation to the people that agitation should be continued for the\r\npurpose of obtaining the desired boon.\r\n\r\n_July_ 19, 1833.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Irish Agitation Characterized_.\r\n\r\nNow, my Lords, in order to enable your Lordships to understand what\r\nthis \"agitation\" is, I beg leave just to describe it to your Lordships.\r\nIt is, first of all, founded upon a conspiracy of priests and demagogues\r\nto obtain their purpose--whether justifiable or not, is not the\r\nquestion--by force and menace, and by the use of terror and of mobs,\r\nwherever that terror and those mobs can be used to produce an effect\r\nupon his Majesty's Government favourable to their views. This agitation\r\nthey have maintained by orations, harangues, and seditious speeches at\r\npublic meetings--by publications through a licentious press--by\r\nexaggerations--by forgeries--and by all other means which it is in the\r\npower of that description of persons to use, in order to excite the\r\nmultitude; and then, when they are excited, to make them appear in large\r\nbodies to terrify and over-awe the people. If, my Lords, any person\r\nventures to oppose himself to these proceedings, he is either\r\nimmediately murdered or his house is destroyed, his cattle or other\r\nproperty carried off, and combinations are formed to prevent resistance,\r\nor the discovery of the guilty. In short, all measures are adopted which\r\ngo to, and which are intended to, destroy the Constitution of this\r\ncountry. This, my Lords, is what is called the system of \"agitation.\"\r\n\r\n_July_ 19, 1833.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_What constitutes a Blockade_.\r\n\r\nTo constitute an effective blockade, it is unnecessary to say that the\r\nport in question must be actually blockaded; and, further, that notice\r\nmust have been given of such a blockade. No capture could be made\r\nwithout previously warning off vessels. There are various modes of\r\nnotice; but the most authoritative manner of giving notice is through\r\nthe Government of the power to be so warned. It should never be\r\nforgotten, however, that there should be certain means in existence to\r\nenforce the blockade at the time of notice.\r\n\r\n_July_ 19, 1833.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Objection to the reduction of the Number of Irish Bishops_.\r\n\r\nI object to the proposed reduction of the number of Bishops in Ireland,\r\nand I totally dissent from the argument upon which the propriety or\r\nexpediency of that reduction is founded. I am willing to admit that if\r\nwe were now, for the first time, establishing the Protestant Church in\r\nIreland. I might be inclined to think that twenty-two Bishops were more\r\nthan was necessary to the supervision of some 1000 clergymen; but when I\r\ntake into account, besides the fact that the higher number has been in\r\nexistence for centuries--when I consider the importance of the\r\nProtestant Church in Ireland in relation to the political ties of the\r\ntwo countries--when I consider, as a Right Reverend Prelate has\r\nremarked in the course of the debate, that wherever a Protestant Bishop\r\nis removed, there a Catholic Prelate will remain, who, doubtless, will\r\npossess himself of the palace, and perhaps the church property, of the\r\nreduced Protestant See; and when, above all, I consider the peculiar\r\ncircumstances of Ireland, so different from those of this country, and\r\nwhich may make the episcopal superintendence of thirty or forty\r\nbenefices in the former country a matter of more trouble and anxiety\r\nthan the 600 or 1000 benefices which an English Prelate may control, I\r\ncannot but object to the proposed reduction. Besides, there is another\r\ncircumstance which is worthy of attention in the discussion of this\r\nsubject, and that is, that the Bishops of England have the assistance of\r\ntheir Deans and Archdeacons, which their Irish brethren have not. The\r\ntwenty-two Bishops of Ireland have personally to perform all the duties\r\nwhich the Bishops of this country perform through their Deans and\r\nArchdeacons.\r\n\r\n_July_ 19,1835\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The Jews' Right to Citizenship denied._\r\n\r\nThe noble and learned Lord (Brougham), and the most reverend Prelate\r\n(Whately), have both stated that they cannot understand the distinct\r\nprinciple upon which the opponents of this measure rest their opposition\r\nto the admission of the Jews to seats in the legislature. Now I beg the\r\nnoble and learned Lord, and the most reverend Prelate, to recollect that\r\nthis is a Christian country and a Christian legislature, and that the\r\neffect of this measure would be to remove that peculiar character. Your\r\nLordships have been called upon to follow the example of foreign\r\ncountries, with respect to the Jews; but I think that, before we\r\nproceed to legislate on such a subject as this, it is indispensable that\r\nthe necessity for the introduction of the measure should be shown. I\r\nask, what case has been made out to shew a necessity for passing this\r\nmeasure? When your Lordships passed the bills for the removal of the\r\nRoman Catholic disabilities, and for the repeal of the Test and\r\nCorporation Acts, the reason assigned was, that it was unnecessary to\r\nkeep up the restriction on the classes of Christians affected by those\r\nacts. But there is a material difference between the cases of the\r\ndissenters and Roman Catholics, and the Jews--the former enjoyed all the\r\nbenefits and advantages of the constitution before the restrictions were\r\nimposed. Was that the case with the Jews? Were the Jews ever in the\r\nenjoyment of the blessings of the English constitution? Certainly not.\r\nThe Jews were formerly considered as alien enemies, and they were not\r\nallowed to live in this country,--I think from the time of Edward I. to\r\nthe period of the Commonwealth. It cannot, therefore, be said that the\r\nquestion of the Jews can be put on the same ground as the claims of any\r\nclass of Christians in the country.\r\n\r\n_August 1,1843._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The Jews have no Right to Civil Equality._\r\n\r\nThe noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack (Lord Brougham) has referred\r\nto a certain Act of Parliament which passed, giving certain privileges\r\nto the Jews, and which he said, was in the very form of words proposed\r\nin this bill. It is true that this Act conferred benefits on the Jews,\r\nbut then it must be recollected that it was confined in its operation to\r\ncertain of the colonies; in the first instance to Canada, and\r\nsubsequently to Jamaica and Barbadoes, and others of the West Indian\r\ncolonies. But then, was there not a very good reason for this? European\r\ninhabitants were much required in the colonies at the time the act\r\npassed; and this was to give encouragement to the Jews to go thither and\r\nsettle. No such necessity exists now, with regard to this country,--we\r\ndo not wish Jews to come and settle here. Not one word has been said to\r\nshew that any necessity exists for passing this measure. The noble Lord,\r\nwho addressed your Lordships early in the debate, adverted to the state\r\nof the Jews in France, I entirely agree with the illustrious Duke near\r\nme, and the right reverend Prelate, that this country is not bound to\r\nfollow the example of foreign nations in legislating for any portion of\r\nthe community. But it ought not to escape attention, that Buonaparte, in\r\nlegislating for the Jews, did not go the full length of this bill; and\r\nbefore he did anything for them, he ordered a strict inquiry into their\r\ncase to be made. I ask, are your Lordships prepared to assent to this\r\nbill, without any inquiry being instituted as to its necessity, or\r\nwithout any reason being assigned? This bill is not the result of\r\ninquiry, but it has been introduced on a very different\r\nprinciple,--namely, because it suits the liberal opinions of the day.\r\n\r\nThe noble and learned Lord on the Woolsack, has endeavoured to shew\r\nthat, by retaining the words--\"upon the true faith of a Christian,\" in\r\nthe Statute Book, you encourage men who have no regard to the obligation\r\nof an oath, and thus maintain hypocrisy, while it operates as a\r\nrestriction on conscientious persons. \"You admit,\" says the noble and\r\nlearned Lord, \"men like Mr. Wilkes, Lord Shaftesbury, or Lord\r\nBolingbroke, but you shut out conscientious men who will not take the\r\noath.\" I am prepared to allow that there are some men whom no oath or\r\naffirmation can reach; but this is no reason why we should give up every\r\ntest and oath. Are we on this account to throw aside every guard for the\r\nmaintenance of Christianity in the country? The Right Reverend Prelate\r\nhas stated very clearly and plainly the reason why we should not pass\r\nthis bill--namely, that this is a Christian country, and has a Christian\r\nlegislature, and that therefore, the Parliament, composed as it is, of\r\nLords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, cannot advise the Sovereign,\r\nas the head of the Church, to sanction a law which will remove the\r\npeculiar character of the legislature, I say that we cannot advise the\r\nSovereign on the throne to pass a law which will admit persons to all\r\noffices, and into the Parliament of the country, who, however\r\nrespectable they may be, still are not Christians, and therefore ought\r\nnot to be allowed to legislate for a Christian Church. The noble\r\nMarquis, for whom I entertain the highest respect, seemed surprised that\r\nI should smile when the noble Marquis spoke in somewhat extravagant\r\nterms of the distinctions which have been acquired by these persons in\r\nforeign countries. I must apologize to the noble Marquis for having\r\nsmiled at that moment, but it certainly appeared to me that the noble\r\nMarquis was rather extravagant in his praise; and, I may be allowed to\r\nadd, that I have never been so fortunate as to hear of those persons\r\nbeing in the stations which he described. The noble marquis stated that\r\nthere were no less than fifteen officers of the Jewish religion at the\r\nbattle of Waterloo; I have not the least doubt that there are many\r\nofficers of that religion of great merit and distinction--but still I\r\nmust again repeat they are not Christians; and, therefore, sitting as I\r\ndo in a Christian legislature, I cannot advise the sovereign on the\r\nthrone to sanction a law to admit them to seats in this house and the\r\nother house of parliament, and to all the rights and privileges enjoyed\r\nby Christians. The noble and learned lord on the woolsack said, that\r\nwhen the observation is mode that Christianity is part and parcel of the\r\nlaw of the land, it is meant that that Christianity is the Church of\r\nEngland. Now, I have always understood that it was the Christian\r\ndispensation, generally; and I believe that when Christianity is talked\r\nof as part and parcel of the law, it means the Christian dispensation,\r\nand not the doctrines of the Church of England.\r\n\r\n_August_ 1, 1833.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Defence of a Metallic Currency_.\r\n\r\nI always have maintained, and I always shall maintain, that the only\r\nproper basis of our money system is a solid gold circulation. Upon that\r\nbasis I considered our monetary system fixed since the measure of 1819,\r\nfollowed up as that was by improvements in 1826: I really think the\r\nprinciple of those measures the best that can be applied to our\r\ncirculation. Detailed payments being made in gold, the larger payments\r\nmight be made in paper, and depend on credit; the true support of the\r\ncredit of whatever paper might be in circulation being, that it was\r\nliable to be paid in gold on demand at any time, at the bank of England,\r\nor at the branch-banks of the bank of England; so that, if any man chose\r\nnot to give credit to the bank of England, he had only to demand gold\r\nfor his paper; or any creditor might, at once, demand from his debtor\r\npayment in solid coin. That however will, to a certain extent, not be\r\nthe case under this bill. I am aware that, eventually, the holder of the\r\npaper can repair to the bank of England and demand gold as heretofore;\r\nand must, therefore give credit to somebody for the amount. That I\r\nconsider a depreciation of the paper of the bank of England. It is a\r\ndepreciation to which if I had been a bank director, I would never have\r\nconsented; indeed, I cannot understand why the bank agreed to this\r\nproposition. I am persuaded that, ere long, great inconveniences will\r\noccur from the provision; and those inconveniences will be felt in a\r\ndepreciation of bank paper. What is the object of the arrangement? It is\r\neither intended to give the bank a power of issuing paper which, under\r\nthe existing system, it does not possess, or to facilitate credit\r\ngenerally throughout the country, and enable the country banks to\r\nundertake operations which they could not otherwise attempt. It is\r\nevident that the noble earl himself sees that the consequence will be to\r\nfacilitate and increase the issues of the country banks. That will\r\naugment all transactions; and the result must be a great increase of\r\nprices, and the ruin of many individuals. Nothing of this kind would\r\nhappen, if the present system were continued; namely, if the bank of\r\nEngland continued to issue the number of its notes which the necessity\r\nof the public might seem to require; and by the regularity of its\r\nproceedings give such a check to the issues of the country banks, as\r\nshould be calculated to establish a sound and healthy circulation. Under\r\nthe existing system, the bank would proceed so as to prevent the country\r\nbanks from giving credit, except in cases which justified the\r\naccommodation, and the circulation and commerce of the country would\r\ncontinue in a wholesome state.\r\n\r\n_August_ 23, 1833.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The Duke of Wellington's reasons for supporting the Poor Law Amendment\r\nBill_.\r\n\r\nI concur with the noble and learned lord on the woolsack, and with the\r\nnoble lord opposite, as to the necessity of this measure. I agree, first\r\nof all, in the existence of grievances consequent upon the existing\r\nadministration of the poor-laws, but I do not concur in the opinion\r\nexpressed by the noble and learned lord (the Lord Chancellor) in\r\ndisapproving of the provisions of the statute of Elizabeth; but I do\r\ndisapprove of a system of administration which differs in each and\r\nevery of the 12,000 parishes in this country, and in each of which\r\ndifferent and varied abuses have crept in. I maintain that it is\r\nimpossible for parliament to frame any law that can by possibility\r\nremedy or apply to the abuses which prevail at the present\r\nmoment--abuses which are as varied in their character as they are\r\nnumerous. It is their general existence all over the country--it is\r\ntheir existence in a different shape in every parish of the\r\nkingdom--which renders the appointment of a central board absolutely\r\nnecessary, with powers to control the whole of the parishes in the land,\r\nand to adopt such remedies as will secure a sure administration of these\r\nlaws throughout the country. If my noble friend, who has spoken in\r\nopposition to this measure, had recently attended to parliamentary\r\nbusiness more assiduously than he has done, he would have found that the\r\nsubject has been submitted to the house by several noble lords, and has\r\nalso been under the consideration of every administration that I have\r\nknown; but no plan has ever been suggested, or scheme proposed, to\r\nremove and remedy the evils of the existing laws, which in my judgment\r\nat all equalled the present, and for it I must return the noble lord\r\nopposite, with whom it has originated, my sincere thanks. The present\r\nremedy for the evils of the existing laws is most unquestionably the\r\nbest that has ever been devised; at the same time I must observe, that\r\nas the central board of commissioners must necessarily have very\r\nextraordinary and full powers, it will be necessary that they should\r\nkeep such a record of their proceedings as shall render them liable to\r\nthe actual control at all times of the government and parliament of the\r\ncountry. I doubt much whether the provisions of this bill give such a\r\ncontroul to the government as will afford a full knowledge to the\r\nparliament at all times of the course pursued by the commissioners; but\r\nin committee on the bill, I shall consider whether some alteration is\r\nnot necessary, in order to make that control more active. There are\r\nseveral other clauses in the bill which require much alteration and\r\nmodification. I entirely approve of the removal of the allowance system,\r\nwhich is one of the greatest evils arising from the existing poor-laws;\r\nbut I am of opinion that it ought gradually and slowly to have been\r\ndestroyed, and without a fixed day for its termination being specified\r\nin the bill. I would recommend that this clause should be left out, and\r\nthat power should be given to the commissioners to carry gradually such\r\nalterations in this respect into effect, as to them may seem meet.\r\n\r\n_July 81,1834_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Tests no Security to Religion_.\r\n\r\nThe noble duke, amongst other matters, has adverted to the union between\r\nchurch and state, with respect to which he has made some observations\r\nwhich are undoubtedly worthy of consideration, but to which I do not\r\nintend, on this occasion, to offer any answer. I will, however, just\r\nobserve, that I apprehend what is generally meant by dissevering the\r\nunion of the church and state is, that there should be no established\r\nreligion. To that proposition, I trust it is superfluous for me to say\r\nthat I am a most decided opponent. It is, however, a subject which I\r\ncannot now pretend to discuss. It is my opinion, that to leave religion\r\nto rest upon the voluntary efforts of the people, is a notion which we\r\nare not at present in a situation competent to entertain. It is so very\r\ngreat a change, and so totally different from all that we know and\r\nobserve, that we are absolutely precluded, from want of experience, from\r\nentering upon the consideration of the question. It is not a just\r\ncriterion, by which to form a judgment, to refer to the experience of\r\nother nations--such as the existence of Christianity in Rome before it\r\nbecame the established religion of the empire, or the existence of\r\nreligion in a country so distant and so unlike our own, in all its\r\ncircumstances, as the United states of North America. That, my lords, is\r\nthe opinion I entertain, and therefore I will no longer occupy your\r\nlordships by any further discussion on this subject. I belong to the\r\nchurch of England, and am a friend of that church, from feeling and from\r\nconviction. I do not say that I have examined all her doctrines, or that\r\nI am master of all the grounds upon which her rites and ceremonies\r\nstand--I do not say that I am able to discuss with my noble friend those\r\none thousand questions, which Bishop Law said arose out of the\r\nthirty-nine articles, but I believe her doctrines to be scriptural, and\r\nI know her principles to be tolerant. But, my lords, I beg leave to say,\r\nthat I adopt those doctrines upon another ground, which perhaps may\r\nexpose me, with some in the present day, to censure. My lords, I espouse\r\nthose doctrines because they are the mode of faith delivered down to me\r\nby my forefathers; and because they are the mode of faith which I find\r\nestablished in my country. I am not prepared to remove the basis upon\r\nwhich is founded (though it may be apart from) the structure of the\r\nreligion of my country. I do not think that such is the wish of the\r\nmajority of the dissenters; but, at all events, it seems to me a course\r\ncalculated to lead only to a state of general scepticism and universal\r\nsuspension of religion among the people. But while I say this for\r\nmyself--while I claim to found my attachment to my religion upon\r\nprinciple, it is necessary that I should say precisely the same thing\r\nfor that great body of men who may be called the dissenters of England.\r\nTheir consent is rarely contemporaneous with the establishment of the\r\nchurch of England herself. The dissenters from the church of England are\r\nthose who thought that the Reformation did not proceed far enough. Their\r\ndissent did not show itself against the established church when in power\r\nand prosperity; but the dissenters from that church grew up first when\r\nthe Roman Catholic religion was dominant in this country, and when both\r\nthe members of the new church of England and the dissenters were alike\r\nsuffering under persecution; therefore, it is a dissent founded on\r\nprinciple. Considering the weight which dissent has in this country, and\r\nconsidering the extent to which it prevails, many attempts have been,\r\nfrom time to time, made, as we all know, at a religious comprehension of\r\nall denominations of Christians in the body of the church. Such attempts\r\nhave been made by some of the greatest prelates that the church has\r\never known. These attempts have all failed; but, surely in our days, it\r\nmay be thought wise to attempt at least a general civil comprehension of\r\nall classes, by admitting them, if it be possible to do so, to those\r\nbenefits which are to be derived from the public institutions of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nI will not go into the foundations of the universities. I am not for\r\nraising any quibble on that subject. I apprehend that they have grown\r\nup, as all other institutions have done, very much from a series of\r\naccidents, and the force of chances. One college has been founded by one\r\nindividual, and one by another; but, however they have grown up, they\r\nhave, in fact, become, and are now considered, as the national\r\nseminaries of education. I would reserve to them, in every respect,\r\ntheir corporate rights. I would respect them as places where the\r\nreligion of the country is taught, and professed; but undoubtedly I\r\nwould if possible, for the sake of general peace and union, and for the\r\nsake of bringing together those who are now divided, try, with the\r\nsanction and approbation of the universities themselves (and we know\r\nperfectly well that most of their distinguished members are of opinion\r\nthat this can be done); I would, I say, try whether we could not open\r\nthe gates of these universities to that great body of this country, who\r\nunfortunately dissent from the doctrines of the church of England. I\r\nwould not do so, however, rashly, nor with any violence to honest\r\nprejudices, or to those well-intentioned feelings which some persons are\r\nfound to cherish.\r\n\r\nThe noble duke has said that tests are no securities against the\r\nadmission of atheists or schismatics, and that a man may take them who\r\ndissented from them, if he chose to stifle all his feelings of right and\r\nwrong. But, my lords, I beg leave to say that tests are no security\r\nagainst any man. It is impossible ever to have looked at the history of\r\nreligion in any state, or at any period, and not to feel that the test\r\nlaws have been the weakest ground upon which any faith could stand. Were\r\ntests any security for the heathen religion against the vital spirit of\r\nthe heaven-descended energy of Christianity? Yet we are aware that every\r\nact of the life of a heathen was in itself a test. He could not sit to\r\nhis meat, he could not retire to rest, he could not go through the most\r\nsimple transactions of life, without some act of acknowledgment offered\r\ntowards some heathen deity. Unless these observances were attended to by\r\nthe Christians, they were subject to the most cruel punishments, and yet\r\nsuch means failed to preserve the dominant faith. In fact, it is well\r\nknown that one of the most violent persecutions of the Christians,\r\ninstituted by the Roman emperors, was followed, as it were, almost\r\nimmediately by the establishment of Christianity as the dominant\r\nreligion of the empire. Were tests any security to the Roman Catholic\r\nreligion, against the growing light and energy of the Protestant faith?\r\nTests of various kinds were adopted at the very moment the new doctrines\r\nshowed themselves, but it was soon found that they were vain and fragile\r\nagainst the light and strength of the new doctrines. Were tests any\r\nsecurity to these very universities themselves? I have not looked very\r\ndeeply into this subject; I have no doubt that if I were to look closer\r\ninto it, I should find more instances of the sort; but I find that about\r\nfourteen years after the establishment of King's College, in the\r\nuniversity of Cambridge, a decree was sent down there by King Henry VI.,\r\nadmonishing the scholars, that is to say, in the language of the present\r\nday, the fellows of that college, against the damnable and pernicious\r\nerrors (so it styled them), of John Wickliffe and Richard Peacock, and\r\ndenouncing the pains of expulsion from college, and perjury, against\r\nthose of them who should show any favour to those doctrines. Yet, in two\r\nyears after this, this very king's college became what, at that time was\r\ncalled the most heretical, but which now, in our time, would be called\r\nthe most Protestant college in the university; and we know that these\r\ndoctrines thus fiercely denounced, and strongly guarded against by\r\ntests, about fifty or sixty years afterwards became, by law, the\r\nestablished religion of this country. It is upon her native\r\nstrength--upon her own truth--it is upon her spiritual character, and\r\nupon the purity of her doctrines, that the Church of England rests. Let\r\nher not, then, look for support in such aids as these. It is by these\r\nmeans, and not by tests and proscriptions, that protestantism has been\r\nmaintained; let her be assured of this.\r\n\r\n_August 1, 1834._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cause of the dismissal of the Melbourne Administration in November,\r\n1834._\r\n\r\nI am not responsible for the dissolution of the late government. The\r\nlate government was dissolved from the absolute impossibility of its\r\ngoing on any longer. When a noble earl (Spencer), whom I do not now see\r\nin his place, was removed from the House of Commons, by the necessity of\r\ntaking his seat in this house, it was impossible for the late government\r\nto go on. I will just desire your lordships to recollect that it was\r\nstated by the noble earl (Grey), who so worthily filled the situation of\r\nprime minister for nearly four years, when his noble colleague (Lord\r\nAlthorp), in the House of Commons, thought proper to resign, \"that he\r\nhad lost his right hand, and that it had thus become absolutely\r\nimpossible for him to continue to carry on the government, or to serve\r\nthe Crown with honour or advantage.\" Not only did the noble earl make\r\nthis declaration of his inability to go on upon the retirement of his\r\nnoble colleague from his majesty's councils, but the noble viscount\r\nopposite, himself, when he afterwards came to form his government,\r\nstated that the noble earl (Spencer), having consented to retain his\r\noffice and position in the House of Commons, he was prepared to\r\nundertake to preside over his majesty's councils, and carry on the\r\nbusiness of the country. But this was not all; for I happen to know\r\nthat, when the noble viscount found that he was likely to be deprived of\r\nthe services and assistance of that noble lord in the other house, he\r\nfelt that his administration would be placed in circumstances of the\r\ngreatest difficulty and embarrassment. Besides that, it was perfectly\r\nwell known to his majesty, that the influence of that noble lord in the\r\nother house of parliament was the foundation on which the government to\r\nwhich he was attached, reposed; and, that that support being removed, it\r\nmust fall. When, therefore, his majesty found that it was fairly put to\r\nhim whether he would consent to arrangements for the late government\r\nproceeding as it best could, or whether he would consent to steps being\r\ntaken for the formation of another administration, it was surely natural\r\nfor his majesty to consider his own situation, and the situation in\r\nwhich the late government was lately placed by the death of the late\r\nEarl Spencer.\r\n\r\n_February 24, 1835_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Why the Duke of Wellington held so many offices_, ad interim, _in\r\nNovember_, 1834.\r\n\r\nI gave his majesty the best advice which, under the circumstances of the\r\ncase, it appeared to me practicable to give. I advised his majesty to\r\nsend for that right hon. gentleman (Sir R. Peel), a member of the House\r\nof Commons, who seemed to me to be the most fit and capable person to\r\nplace at the head of the new administration, as first lord of the\r\ntreasury. That right honourable gentleman was then in another part of\r\nthe world, and some time must necessarily elapse before it would be\r\npossible that he could return to this country. It appeared to his\r\nmajesty and to myself, however, to be essentially necessary that, in the\r\nmeantime, the government should be taken possession of and\r\nadministered. This step I considered to be absolutely necessary, and I\r\nalso felt it to be absolutely necessary that, whoever might exercise the\r\nauthority of government in the interval, should take no step that might\r\nembarrass or compromise the right honourable baronet on his return. It\r\nwas only on that ground that I accepted, for the time, of the offices of\r\nfirst lord of the treasury, and secretary of state for the home\r\ndepartment.\r\n\r\nThe noble viscount has made a little mistake in alleging that I was\r\nappointed to three departments at once. He makes it a matter of charge\r\nagainst me that I exercised the authority of the three secretaries of\r\nstate; but the noble viscount knows very well that the secretary of\r\nstate for the home department is competent, under certain circumstances,\r\nto do so. It was for the public service, and the public convenience, and\r\nno other reason whatever, that I, my lords, consented to hold, for a\r\ntime, the situations of first lord of the treasury, and secretary of\r\nstate for the home department. But I want to know whether this was, as\r\nthe noble viscount insinuates, an unprecedented act? When Mr. Canning\r\nwas secretary of state for the foreign department, he was appointed\r\nfirst lord of the treasury. The latter office Mr. Canning received on\r\nthe 12th of April, and he did not resign the seals of the foreign\r\ndepartment until the 30th of that month. During the whole of that period\r\nMr. Canning discharged the duties both of secretary of state for foreign\r\naffairs, and first lord of the treasury. My lords, I am quite aware\r\nthat there were at that period, two other secretaries of state, but the\r\nfact is as I have stated it, that Mr. Canning exercised at the same\r\ntime; the functions both of first lord of the treasury, and secretary of\r\nstate for the foreign department. The transaction in my case was,\r\ntherefore, not unprecedented; and I must also say, that when the noble\r\nviscount thought proper to blame me, as he did, he was bound to show\r\nthat my conduct, in that respect, had been attended with some evil or\r\ninconvenient result. Now, it does not appear that it has been attended\r\nwith any such result. The fact is, that during the whole of the time\r\nthat I held the two offices. I cautiously avoided taking any step which\r\nmight be productive of subsequent embarrassment or inconvenience, and\r\nwhen my right honourable friend took possession of his office, I can\r\nundertake to say that he did not find himself compromised by any such\r\nact.\r\n\r\n_February_ 24,1835.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Lord Londonderry's appointment to the Embassy at St. Petersburgh._\r\n\r\nMy lords, having learned that it would not be disagreeable to my noble\r\nfriend to be employed in the public service, I did concur in the\r\nrecommendation, or rather, my lords, I did recommend to my right\r\nhonourable friend, Sir Robert Peel, that my noble friend should be\r\nappointed ambassador to the court of St. Petersburgh. I made this\r\nrecommendation, founded as it was on my own personal knowledge of my\r\nnoble friend for many years past,--on the many great and important\r\nmilitary services he has performed, and on the fitness he has proved\r\nhimself to possess for such an appointment in those various diplomatic\r\nemployments he has filled during a long period of time; more\r\nparticularly at the court of Vienna, where for a period of nine years,\r\nhe performed most important services to the entire satisfaction of the\r\nministers who employed him, up to the last moment of his employment. He\r\nreturned from the discharge of that office, my lords, with the strongest\r\ntestimony of the approbation of the then secretary of state for foreign\r\naffairs. I was aware, my lords, of the peculiar talents of my noble\r\nfriend in certain respects, for this particular office, and of his\r\nconsequent fitness for this very description of diplomatic employment,\r\nespecially on account of his being a military officer of high rank in\r\nthe service of this country, and of distinguished reputation in the\r\nRussian army. I knew the peculiar advantages that must attach to an\r\nindividual conducting such an embassy on that account. Under these\r\ncircumstances, I was justified, my lords, in recommending my noble\r\nfriend, and I was glad to find that my right honourable friend concurred\r\nin that recommendation, and that his majesty was pleased to approve of\r\nit. I may also add, that the nomination of my noble friend having been\r\ncommunicated in the usual manner to the court of St. Petersburgh, it was\r\nreceived with approbation at that court. For all these reasons, my\r\nlords, it was with the greatest regret I learned that this\r\nnomination,--for it had gone no further than nomination,--was not\r\napproved of in another place; for it is in consequence of that\r\nexpression of disapproval that my noble friend, with that delicacy of\r\nfeeling which belongs to his character, has declined the office.\r\n\r\n_March_ 16,1834.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Prerogative of the Crown in appointing Ambassadors._\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt whatever that there is no branch of the\r\nprerogative of the crown greater, or more important, than that of\r\nsending ambassadors to foreign courts; nor is there any branch of that\r\nprerogative the unrestricted use of which ought to be kept more\r\ninviolate. But, my lords, the ministers of the crown are responsible for\r\nthese nominations. They are also responsible for the instructions under\r\nwhich my noble friend, or any other noble lord so nominated, is bound to\r\nact. They are, moreover, responsible for the proper performance of these\r\nduties on the part of those whom they select--to the other house of\r\nparliament, and to the country at large. It is impossible, therefore,\r\nfor me to believe that the House of Commons would in this case proceed\r\nso far as to interfere with that peculiar prerogative, and to say that\r\nan individual who has been already nominated by the crown should not\r\nfill the situation; inasmuch as, by so doing, the House of Commons would\r\nnot only be taking upon itself the nomination of the officer, and the\r\ndirection of the particular duties to be discharged by him--but would\r\nalso be relieving the minister from the constitutional responsibility of\r\nthe appointment. I do not think that sentiments of such a description,\r\non a subject of this delicacy and importance, are very general; and I\r\ncannot bring myself to believe that a vote affirming such a violation of\r\nthe royal prerogative would have passed the House of Commons.\r\n\r\n_March 15,1835._\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n_The Roman Catholics interested in maintaining the Established Church._\r\n\r\nThe great bulk of the Roman Catholics are as much interested as the\r\nProtestants of the established church in maintaining the safety of the\r\nestablished church.\r\n\r\n_June 10, 1835._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Defence of the Thirty-nine Articles._\r\n\r\nI conceive that there is no cause to complain of the subscription to the\r\nthirty-nine articles, as practised in Oxford. The explanation given by\r\nthe most reverend prelate is entirely borne out by the statues of the\r\nuniversity, and by the practice that prevails there; and this\r\nexplanation agrees entirely with that given by a right reverend prelate,\r\nwho was formerly head of one of the colleges at Oxford. It might,\r\nperhaps, be desirable that some other test should be adopted to prove\r\nthat the individuals to be matriculated are members of the church of\r\nEngland; the most important point is, that Cambridge and Oxford should\r\nbe filled only by members of the Church of England--upon that I consider\r\nthe whole question to rest. The noble earl said, in the course of the\r\ndiscussion, that I advised your lordships not to consent to the bill\r\nintroduced last session; because, if you did, you would have to carry\r\nto the foot of the throne a measure which would tend to subvert the\r\nunion between church and state. My meaning in so doing was neither more\r\nnor less than this--that it was absolutely necessary that the\r\nuniversities, founded as they are, should educate their members in the\r\nreligion of the church of England. Your lordships could not go to the\r\nking, and ask his consent to a bill which had for its object to\r\nestablish in the university a system of education different from that of\r\nthe church of England, without attacking the very foundation of the\r\nprinciple of the connexion between church and state. But the noble lord\r\nsays, the church herself does not exact subscription to the thirty-nine\r\narticles from each individual. It is very true that the church of\r\nEngland does not require subscription from her members, nor would the\r\nuniversity of Oxford require it, but as a proof that the person\r\nsubscribing was a member of that church, or of the family of a member\r\nthereof.\r\n\r\nThe noble earl stated that individuals might obtain admittance to the\r\nuniversities both of Oxford and Cambridge, notwithstanding that they\r\nwere dissenters; but there is a great deal of difference between\r\ncasually admitting dissenters, and permitting them to enter into the\r\nuniversities as a matter of right. I see no objection to the admission\r\nof the few now admitted, who must submit to the regulations and\r\ndiscipline of the university, and of its several colleges; but I do\r\nobject to the admission of dissenters into the universities by right;\r\nand my reason for making this exception is, that I am exceedingly\r\ndesirous that the religion taught there should be the religion of the\r\nchurch of England; and I confess I should be very apprehensive that, if\r\ndissenters of all denominations were admitted by right, and they were\r\nnot under the necessity of submitting to the rules and regulations of\r\nthe several colleges, not only would the religion of the church of\r\nEngland not to be taught there, but no kind of religion whatever. I\r\nstate this on the authority of a report which I have recently received\r\nof the proceedings of an institution in this country for the instruction\r\nof children of dissenting clergymen; from which it appears absolutely\r\nimpossible, for any length of time, to adhere to any creed, or any tenet\r\nor doctrine in these seminaries, in which every doctrine is matter of\r\ndispute and controversy. I was rather surprised to hear the noble\r\nviscount opposite--a minister of the crown--express his preference for\r\npolemical disputations in the universities. I should have thought that\r\nhe would have felt it to be his inclination, as well as duty, by all\r\nmeans to protect the universities from such disputes, and from a system\r\nfruitful in such controversies; and probably to end in a cessation of\r\nany system of religion or religious instruction whatever, on account of\r\nthe different opinions of the members.\r\n\r\n_July_ 14,1835.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_University Tests rendered necessary by Toleration._\r\n\r\nThe tests in our universities are the children of the Reformation, which\r\nthe system of toleration wisely established in this country has\r\nrendered still more necessary, if we intend to preserve the standard of\r\nthe religion of the church of England. If we open the door wide and say\r\n\"We will have no established religion at all--every man shall follow the\r\nreligion he chooses\"--if, in a word, we have recourse to the voluntary\r\nsystem,--then we must make up our minds to take the consequences which\r\nmust follow from the enactments of the bill and the polemical and other\r\ncontroversial agitations to which it must lead. But, supposing the\r\nobject of the noble lord, to put an end to these tests, to be desirable,\r\nI can conceive no mode of effecting this object so objectionable as the\r\ninterference by parliament with the privileges of the universities,\r\nsecured to them by charter and repeatedly acknowledged and confirmed by\r\nparliament.\r\n\r\n_July_ 14 1835\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Irish Clergy--their Depression by the Melbourne Government_.\r\n\r\nI do say that the Protestant people and clergy of Ireland have great\r\nreason to complain of the want of protection to their rights and\r\nproperties manifested on the part of the government of this country; and\r\nthis is the cause of those disputes and those circumstances which the\r\nnoble lord opposite (Lord Melbourne) has complained of in the few words\r\nhe has addressed to the house on the subject. Far be it from me to wish\r\nfor the renewal of any dissensions in Ireland; and, God knows, I would\r\ngo any length, and do any thing in my power to put them down in the\r\nextent to which they now exist; but we are mistaken if we suppose that\r\nthey can be put down by oppressing one party, or allowing one party to\r\noppress another, or by extinguishing--an extinction which for the last\r\nthree or four years you have attempted and are now about to\r\ncomplete--that description of property in Ireland allotted to the\r\npayment of the clergy. This is the circumstance which occasions the\r\npresent dissensions in Ireland, and which has induced the present\r\ndiscussion in this house. The noble lord opposite cannot lament the\r\ncause of such discussions more than I do; but if he be determined to do\r\nhis duty, let him give the protection of his majesty's government to the\r\nProtestant clergy and people of Ireland, as he does not hesitate to do\r\nin the case of other classes in that country; and the evils which he so\r\nmuch deplores will soon cease to exist.\r\n\r\n_July_ 16, 1835.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_A Power of Revising Railway Acts ought to be Reserved by the\r\nLegislature_.\r\n\r\nI certainly have a very strong feeling on the subject of all these\r\nrailways to be traversed by the aid of steam. I sincerely wish that all\r\nthese projects could prove successful; but, in proportion as they may be\r\nsuccessful, in the same proportion is it desirable that there should not\r\nbe a perpetual monopoly established in the country. Under these\r\ncircumstances, I have a strong feeling that it is desirable to insert in\r\nall these bills some clause, to enable the government or the parliament\r\nto revise the enactments contained in them at some future specific\r\nperiod. I conceive that, by carrying these measures into execution, a\r\nvery great injustice is often done to many landed proprietors in the\r\ncountry; and they are forced either to submit to great inconvenience, or\r\nto contend against that inconvenience by incurring a very large expense,\r\nboth in this and the other house of parliament. If some measure of the\r\ndescription to which I allude be not adopted, and if these railroads are\r\nto become monopolies in the hands of present or of future proprietors,\r\nwe shall hereafter be only able to get the better of such monopolies by\r\nforming fresh lines of road, to the farther detriment of the interests\r\nof the landed proprietors, and at a great increase of expense and\r\ninconvenience. These circumstances have most forcibly struck my mind. I\r\nhave had the subject under consideration for some days; I have conversed\r\nwith others respecting it; and it appears to me that some plan ought to\r\nbe devised in order to bring these railroads under the supervision of\r\nparliament at some future period. I therefore am anxious that the\r\nfurther proceedings in all these bills[18] should be suspended for a\r\nshort time, in order that I may propose some clause, or introduce some\r\nmeasure, to meet the object to which I have referred. I think it is a\r\nsubject the consideration of which ought not to fall on any individual.\r\nIt is, I conceive, a matter which the government should take into its\r\nespecial consideration. I am, however, perfectly ready to share with the\r\ngovernment the responsibility of proposing such a measure to the house.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: Some railway bills before the Home of Lords.]\r\n\r\n_June_ 3,1836.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Moderation of the Opposition in the House of Lords towards the\r\nMelbourne Government_.\r\n\r\nFrom my own experience, I must take the liberty of observing, that I\r\nconsider the conduct pursued by noble lords on this side of the house,\r\nthroughout the present session, to have been marked with the utmost\r\nmoderation. For myself, I think I am correct in stating, that since the\r\naddress to the throne in answer to the king's speech, with the exception\r\nonly of one occasion, when I requested the noble viscount to postpone\r\nthe Corporations (Ireland) Bill till after the Easter holidays, I never\r\nentered the house till after Easter. Since that period, I have certainly\r\ntaken part in the proceedings that have been going forward in the house,\r\nand I have felt it my duty to oppose some of the measures of government;\r\nbut I think I shall be borne out when I say that I have accompanied the\r\nvote which I have given with observations expressed in terms of great\r\nmoderation. I have acted on all occasions to the best of my opinion, and\r\nin a way which I thought most calculated to be beneficial to the\r\ncountry. The noble viscount has been pleased to taunt us for not having\r\naddressed the king with a view to obtain his and his colleagues' removal\r\nfrom the situations which they hold. If the noble viscount would look at\r\nthe manner in which they were appointed to office, if he would look at\r\nthe whole history for the last twelve months I think he would find\r\nsufficient reason for our not having adopted that course of proceeding.\r\nThe noble viscount knows very well upon what ground he stands, and\r\nknowing that, it would have been just as well in him if he had avoided\r\nhis taunts against us for not having asked the king to remove him from\r\noffice. I would take the liberty to recommend the noble viscount to\r\nconsider himself not as the minister of a democratic body in another\r\nplace, but as the minister of a sovereign in a limited monarchy, in a\r\ncountry, great in point of extent, great in its possessions, and in the\r\nvarious interests which it comprises; and that considering these\r\ncircumstances, he should, in future, concert such measures as he has\r\nreason to think may pass with the approval and suit the general\r\ninterests of all,--meet the good will of all,--and not of one\r\nparticular party in one particular place only. If the noble viscount\r\nwill but follow that course for some little time, he will find no\r\ndifficulty in conducting the business of government in this house, but\r\nwill find every facility afforded him in forwarding measures of the\r\nabove description. I would beg the noble lord to recollect one fact, in\r\nregard to the church of England, whether in England or Ireland. Let him\r\nrecollect that the avowed policy followed by this country during the\r\nlast three hundred years, has been to retain inviolable the church\r\nestablishment. We are called here to consult particularly for the good\r\nof the church; and if the noble viscount brings forward any measures\r\nrelating to that subject, let him recollect that all measures of such a\r\nkind must be discussed by us with that particular object in view. This\r\nis not only the old feeling of this house of three hundred years'\r\nstanding, but it is that on which we acted no longer than eight or nine\r\nyears ago, when we had occasion to review the safeguards and general\r\nlandmarks whereby the church establishment of this country was defended.\r\n\r\n_August_ 18, 1836.\r\n\r\n_The Quadruple Treaty. Effects of our Intervention in Spain_.\r\n\r\nIt is well known to your lordships that I was one of those who objected\r\nto the treaty called the \"Quadruple Treaty.\" It is perfectly true that I\r\nwas afterwards instrumental in carrying it into effect; because it was\r\nmy duty, in the situation in which I was placed at that time, to carry\r\ninto effect those treaties which his majesty had entered into, whether I\r\nhad originally approved of them or not. I cannot, therefore, now,\r\ndisapprove of the due execution of the quadruple treaty by others; nor\r\nwill I refuse my assent to the proposition that the measures which his\r\nmajesty has adopted in execution of the treaty are satisfactory as far\r\nas we have any knowledge of them. If any measures should have been\r\nadopted, not already provided for in the treaty, it will be our duty to\r\nconsider them calmly and dispassionately. Much discussion has taken\r\nplace in other countries with respect to the course pursued by other\r\nmembers of this alliance, in the execution of this treaty. I must say,\r\nthat so far as I am enabled to form a judgment of the treaty, (and I\r\nknow nothing more than what appears on the face of the treaty itself) it\r\nseems to me that it has been fairly executed by all the parties who\r\nsubscribed it. When I had the honour of serving his majesty in 1834, I\r\nwas called upon to state whether the treaty in question would be carried\r\ninto execution. I then stated what I understood was the meaning and\r\nscope of the treaty;--viz. that there should be no armed intervention in\r\nthe internal affairs of Spain, which should tend to affect the\r\nindependence of that country. That was my sense of the treaty at the\r\ntime--it is my sense of the treaty at the present moment--it was so\r\nunderstood by the other parties to the treaty. It was the understanding\r\nof all parties that there should he no military intervention in the\r\ninternal affairs of Spain. This was the understanding of the treaty, and\r\nin the month of November, 1834, this explanation was communicated and\r\nwas satisfactory to the Spanish government.\r\n\r\nI consider that the attempt by his majesty's government, aided even by\r\nthe strongest power in Europe, to force upon Spain any form of\r\ngovernment, must fail. Those who should make the attempt must take upon\r\nthemselves not only the expenses of their own army in a most expensive\r\ncontest, but those of the civil and military government of Spain; and\r\nthey must hold their position in Spain, and defray their expenses till\r\nthe new government should be settled and submitted to, and tranquillity\r\nestablished in the country. I should like to see how the Commons House\r\nof Parliament, or the Chamber of Deputies, would treat a proposition\r\nthat should call upon them to agree to a vote of money for any such\r\noperation, for the purpose of forcibly imposing a liberal government on\r\nSpain, or on any other country. I contend my lords, that this scheme is\r\nabsolutely impracticable. His majesty's ministers may rely on it, that\r\nthey have undertaken that which they never can perform; and that the\r\nsooner they place themselves on the footing on which they ought strictly\r\nto stand with reference to the quadruple alliance, the sooner will the\r\npacification of Spain, which we must all of us anxiously wish for, be\r\naccomplished. I feel, for one, the strongest objection to anything like\r\ninterference with the internal affairs of the Peninsula. I object to it,\r\nnot only on account of the vast expense it must inevitably entail upon\r\nthis country, but still more so on account of the injury which it\r\ninflicts on the parties existing in that state. Of my own certain\r\nknowledge I can state, that the individuals composing these parties in\r\nSpain, have actually been ruined, their properties confiscated, their\r\nfortunes sacrificed, by the course which his majesty's government have\r\npursued. Acting under the assurances of his majesty's government,\r\nindividuals have adopted a certain line of conduct. They followed his\r\nmajesty's government, as a party in the state. His majesty's government,\r\nthus acting, is obliged to move forward with the democratic movement The\r\nunfortunate persons I have alluded to have, in consequence, been\r\nabandoned, their fortunes sacrificed, and their prospects blighted for\r\never. Events like these, my lords, which affect the character as well as\r\nthe influence of the country, inclined me to be more adverse to such\r\ninterference than I should be on the mere score of expense. I do not\r\nmean to oppose the address, but in taking this course, I beg to be\r\nclearly understood as not holding myself bound to approve of the\r\nemployment of any force beyond that stipulated for by the quadruple\r\ntreaty, which treaty parliament has recognised.\r\n\r\n_January_ 30,1837.\r\n\r\n_The Poor Law Act has surpassed his expectation_.\r\n\r\nMy lords, I supported the bill while it was in this house; and having\r\ngiven that support to the bill from being a witness to the evils, and\r\nbeing apprehensive of the consequences likely to have attended the\r\nformer system, I conceive it to be my duty to come forward on this\r\noccasion, and to state that this bill has surpassed any expectation\r\nwhich I had formed of the benefits likely to result from it. The bill,\r\nmy lords, may require amendment in certain parts, and it appears that\r\nhis majesty's government have taken measures to ascertain what points in\r\nthe bill so require amendment. I, for one, am ready to pay the greatest\r\nattention to the points which may be brought under the consideration of\r\nthis house. But I must say that I approve of the measure as far as it\r\nhas gone hitherto, and I have witnessed its operation. I do not talk of\r\nwhat I have seen generally, I talk of the details of the management of\r\nthe bill, from having witnessed that management in different workhouses,\r\nin different parts of the country in which I have resided; and I must\r\nsay that it has been practically beneficial, and particularly in cases\r\nsuch as these. First of all, it has put the workman and his employer\r\nupon a true and friendly footing of confidence. Then it has connected\r\nthe man of property, the man of the highest rank in his country, with\r\nthe lowest class, with the labouring class, by admitting such to the\r\nboard of Guardians. I can mention some noble lords, who are ornaments to\r\nthis house, and who constantly attend at the weekly meetings of the\r\nguardians, being elected guardians by the parishes in the neighbourhood\r\nin which they reside. No measure could be attended with better results,\r\nand being convinced that it will effect still greater benefits,\r\nsincerely thinking so, I should be ashamed if I did not step forward,\r\nand at once avow my sentiments respecting it. I avow at once that I\r\nsupported the bill at the time his majesty's ministers proposed it--that\r\nI do not repent of what I did on that occasion in so supporting it--but,\r\non the contrary, that I rejoice in the part I then took; and I now\r\ncongratulate his majesty's ministers on its success.\r\n\r\n_April_ 7, 1837.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The Universities--their Education System the admiration of the World._\r\n\r\nThe working of all these colleges and of the system on which they are\r\nregulated, is for the benefit of the public; and in each and every\r\ncollege the object is to carry into execution the will of the founder,\r\njust as it would probably have been had he lived to this period. In\r\nevery case the great object of the governing authorities is, to benefit\r\nthe public by the education of the youth who resort to these\r\ninstitutions. The noble viscount (Melbourne) could not help admitting\r\nthat these institutions have worked well, and that latterly a great\r\nimprovement has taken place in the system of education pursued under\r\ntheir auspices. The noble viscount has also spoken of the great\r\nimprovement in the system of education pursued in the new university of\r\nDurham, and in other new universities elsewhere. But, nevertheless, the\r\nnoble viscount could not help admitting that the old universities of\r\nOxford and Cambridge possess the merit of having established in England\r\nan excellent system of education, which is, in point of fact, the envy\r\nand admiration of the world.\r\n\r\n_April_ 11, 1837.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The Quadruple Treaty condemned_.\r\n\r\nMy lords, I must confess that I did not approve of the original\r\nQuadruple Treaty. I considered it inconsistent with the ancient\r\nprinciple and the policy and practice adopted in this country with\r\nregard to Portugal, to avoid to interfere in the disputes between the\r\ntwo princes of the House of Braganza, which had been the policy of this\r\ncountry for many years. It sanctioned the introduction of Spanish troops\r\ninto Portugal, which measure was inconsistent with our defensive\r\nrelations with Portugal, and which had been objected to and prevented in\r\nthat very contest between the rival princes of the House of Braganza.\r\nYet it gave no fresh assistance to bring the contests in Portugal to a\r\nconclusion, excepting the promise to give the aid of this country by the\r\nemployment of a naval force in co-operation with the Spanish and\r\nPortuguese troops, which aid was not necessary. Another objection which\r\nI entertained to the Quadruple Treaty was, that it mixed up France and\r\nthis country in the offers and promises made to Don Carlos and Don\r\nMiguel, in the fifth and sixth articles of the treaty. These powers\r\nbecame, in fact, guarantees for the performance of these engagements, as\r\nwell as for the performance of the engagements made under the same\r\narticles of the treaty to the subjects of Portugal and Spain. It is\r\nimpossible to describe the inconvenience of such articles; they require\r\nthe interference of government in hundreds of little questions. I have\r\nfelt the inconvenience of those articles since their adoption; I stated\r\nmy objections to them at the time, and I have seen no reason, since, to\r\nalter the opinions I then formed.\r\n\r\n_April_ 21, 1837.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Effects of the Additional Articles to the Quadruple Treaty._\r\n\r\nBy the first of the additional articles to the treaty, the King of the\r\nFrench obliged himself to take such measures in those parts of his\r\ndominions which adjoined to Spain, as might be calculated to prevent\r\nsuccours of men, arms, and warlike stores being sent from France into\r\nSpain; and the King of Great Britain engaged, under the second of the\r\nsaid additional articles, to furnish such arms and warlike stores as her\r\nmajesty the Queen of Spain might require; and further to assist her\r\nmajesty with a naval force if necessary. The Duke of Braganza was to\r\ngive his best assistance to serve her majesty, that he might be called\r\nupon to render. So that those additional articles were essentially\r\ndifferent from the terms and provisions of the original treaty, by which\r\nthe removal of the two princes from Portugal was effected. I do not mean\r\nto say, that, in the preamble to that treaty, allusion is not made to\r\nthe affairs both of Spain and Portugal, but there still is a remarkable\r\ndifference between the words used in the treaty and the additional\r\narticles; and moat particularly in relation to the part to be taken by\r\nthis country.\r\n\r\n_April_ 21, 1837.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The Legion and the Stock Exchange.--Impotency of our interference_.\r\n\r\nI contend, as I have before contended in this house, that his majesty's\r\npresent ministers (Lord Melbourne's government) ought not to have\r\ndeparted from the position which the previous administration had\r\nestablished while they were in power. I will not pretend to say what\r\nwould have been the result of their following out that course, but this\r\nI do say, that the course pursued by his lordship's government has not\r\nbenefited the military or the financial affairs of Spain, or promoted\r\nthe peace of that country or the general tranquillity of Europe, or\r\nattained any of the political advantages which the noble viscount boasts\r\nhave been attained by his departure from that position which the\r\nprevious government had occupied and left to their successors. But, my\r\nlords, it did unfortunately happen that certain parties in this country\r\nhad been connected with the Spanish finances; and it was important to\r\nthose parties that the red coats should make their appearance in Spain,\r\nand that the name of \"Great Britain,\" and of the British legion, should\r\nbe mixed up in the operations of the war. Money was raised in this\r\ncountry to defray the expense of the equipment of the \"Legion,\" as it\r\nwas called, of 10,000 or 12,000 men, and also of their pay, their food,\r\nand maintenance, for a certain number of months; and the noble lords, in\r\norder that this scheme might be carried into execution, gave their\r\nconsent to the order in council for the suspension of the Foreign\r\nEnlistment Act. The corps gathered in this country, and went to Spain,\r\nin the spring of the year 1835, nearly two years ago. Their first\r\noperation upon their arrival at St. Sebastian, was a march over the very\r\nsame ground to the very spot which was the scene of the late disaster.\r\nMy lords, up to that moment, the Eliot convention, as it is most\r\nhonourably and justly called, had been carried into execution. It was on\r\nthat day departed from on both sides, and from that day to this, I\r\nfirmly believe, from all I have seen and read,--and I have read much on\r\nthe subject within the last few days--there has been no certainty in the\r\nexecution of that convention. Not only has there been no certainty in\r\nthe execution of that convention, but, notwithstanding the millions of\r\nmoney that Spain has expended,--notwithstanding the blood which has been\r\nshed and the number of lives that have been lost,--I will venture to\r\nsay, that the military affairs of the Queen of Spain are in a worse\r\ncondition now than they were in the month of May, 1835.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the policy of the British government, therefore; all the\r\noperations of the British legion, backed by the British squadron; have\r\neffected nothing more nor less towards putting an end to the war, and\r\ngiving peace to Spain and to Europe, than the removal of the blockade of\r\nSt. Sebastian from one point to another, so as not to come within the\r\nliability of being affected by the 68-pounders of the British steamers,\r\nunder the command of Lord John Hay.\r\n\r\n_April_ 21,1837.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Uselessness of the operations of the Legion, and Lord John Hay's\r\nSquadron, at St. Sebastian_.\r\n\r\nIf the noble lord supposes that the safety of St. Sebastian had been\r\nmore or less endangered by the blockade, I can assure him that he is\r\nmuch mistaken; for, from what I know of that fortified town, which is\r\none of the first or second order in Europe, I can take upon myself to\r\nsay that the Carlists might have been left in their original position\r\nwithout any danger whatever to the town, because they could not make an\r\nattack upon such a fortress. In the whole course of the war they have\r\nnot, to my knowledge, taken by an attack any fortified post; or even any\r\nopen town of any magnitude, prepared for its defence. They could not\r\nhave distressed St. Sebastian for provisions, because its communication\r\nwith the sea could not be prevented. I say, it could not be prevented,\r\neven if the whole British fleet were blockading it, instead of being\r\nthere to relieve it. The amount of inconvenience felt in the town from\r\nthe Carlist force being in the neighbourhood, was neither more nor less\r\nthan the unpleasantness of ladies and gentlemen, residing there, being\r\nprevented taking their evening walks in the neighbourhood. This is the\r\nwhole amount of the inconvenience from which the town was relieved. This\r\nwas the whole amount of the service rendered.\r\n\r\n_April_ 21,1837.\r\n\r\n_Strictures on General Evans_.\r\n\r\nMy lords, I will go a little further. I will say, that I firmly believe\r\nthat the connexion between the legion and the fleet has been injurious\r\nto the military operations of the queen of Spain's generals. That is my\r\ndecided opinion, founded upon my knowledge of the nature of the country,\r\nand of the position of both parties. My lords, there is one point to\r\nwhich I refer; that is, the want of communication between the Queen of\r\nSpain's generals, which can be relied upon. If corps of the size of\r\nthose now employed are not actually joined, there must be a certain\r\ncommunication between them; for, without communication there can be no\r\nco-operation; and any attempt at co-operation would, in my opinion, in\r\nall probability, lead to disasters such as have recently taken place at\r\nHernani. How are these troops situated? General Evans's troops are at\r\nSt. Sebastian; General Saarsfield is at the other side of the Borunda,\r\nat Pampeluna; and Espartero, with his army, is at Bilboa. It is\r\nimpossible that there can be any communication between these three,\r\nexcept by the French frontier, and by sea from Socoa, or by the Ebro. An\r\narrangement is made for an attack, and a day named. What was the\r\nconsequence? General Evans made an attack, but General Saarsfield, at\r\nPampeluna, does not attack; there is a frost or snow, or rain, or some\r\nphysical impediment which prevents a movement on the part of Saarsfield.\r\nGeneral Evans cannot be informed in time, and the enemy has opportunity\r\nand leisure to throw his whole force upon General Evans; who, even if\r\nthe troops had behaved well, would have been compelled to retire. The\r\nposition, therefore, of the legion at St. Sebastian, in order to\r\nco-operate with the British squadron, that there might be something like\r\nBritish co-operation, was not an operation of war, it was one of\r\nstock-jobbing. My lords, it is a matter of much surprise to me, that\r\nGeneral Evans, who, having acquired the confidence of his majesty's\r\ngovernment, and that of the Queen of Spain, I presume must be an able\r\nman--it is, certainly, a surprising circumstance, that having had\r\nexperience of the difficulties of carrying on communication in that\r\ncountry, and having met with a check in the month of January, 1836, for\r\nwant of communication, he should not have felt the danger of his\r\nposition, and should have omitted to put himself in communication to a\r\ncertainty with corps in whose co-operation he was to act, instead of\r\nkeeping himself at a distance, in order that he might carry on\r\noperations in concert with his majesty's fleet.\r\n\r\n_April_ 21,1837.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Undisciplined state of the Legion_.\r\n\r\nThe noble lord has stated that he will not recall the marines. I would\r\nbeg to remind your lordships, and the noble viscount in particular, of\r\nthis fact--that the marines are properly the garrisons of his majesty's\r\nships, and that upon no pretence ought they to be moved from a fair and\r\nsafe communication with the ships to which they belong. The noble lord\r\nstates, that he is responsible, and that he will take upon himself the\r\nresponsibility. I have commanded his majesty's armies, and have incurred\r\nas many risks, and faced more difficulties than, I hope, the noble lord\r\nwill ever have to encounter. I have been engaged in hostilities of this\r\ndescription, where co-operation was carried on upon the coast; and\r\nthough I certainly would do as much for the service, and I believe I may\r\nsay, have done as much for the service, as the noble lord, yet I would\r\nnot venture, and have never ventured, to put any corps whatever in\r\nco-operation with the Spaniards, or in any situation whatever in which\r\nthe detached troops could not communicate with the corps from which they\r\nwere detached; and, above all, upon the sea-coast, where the troops\r\ndetached could not hold communication with the ships. The first order to\r\neach of these detachments was, to keep the communication with their\r\nships. The loss of 400 or 500 marines may not materially involve the\r\nhonour of this country, but the lives of the men ought not to be\r\nendangered, as they must be, if care be not taken that they should have\r\na communication with a point of safety, without some very extraordinary\r\ncause. We hear of the operations of the marines with the Austrians. But\r\nthe Spanish troops, and particularly the British legion, are not the\r\nAustrians. I cannot consider this corps of General Evans to be in a\r\nstate of discipline and subordination, such as a body of troops ought to\r\nbe in, with which his majesty's marine forces ought to be connected.\r\nThey have suffered very considerably; their losses have been great, and\r\nhave affected their subordination, their good order and discipline,\r\nparticularly in the presence of an enemy. A disaster or panic may occur\r\namong the best troops; but among such, order can be re-established. It\r\ndoes not appear that these are in the state in which they ought to be,\r\nto render it safe to co-operate with them. No efforts of their officers\r\ncan, in such cases, have any effect upon them.\r\n\r\n_April_ 21,1837.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Intervention, if at all, should be on a National Scale_.\r\n\r\nThe noble viscount says that we are carrying on these operations with\r\nthe object of maintaining the peace of Europe; and these objects are,\r\nmore especially, put forth in a pamphlet which is attributed to a\r\ncolleague of the noble viscount, who has applauded his opinions, if he\r\nhas not gone further, and adopted them as his own. Is the noble lord\r\ndesirous, in accordance with the policy so set forth, to press upon the\r\nnation the adoption of the system of a general combination of the powers\r\nof the west, upon principles offensive as well as defensive, against the\r\npowers of the north and east of Europe? If so momentous an affair and\r\nsuch a course are seriously contemplated, they should not be commenced\r\nby stealth, but in a manner worthy of the character of a great nation\r\nlike Great Britain. It is not by allowing Spain to raise a legion here\r\nin the first instance, and afterwards by sending a few hundred marines,\r\nthat any really important object can be accomplished. But if the noble\r\nlords are in earnest, a message should be sent to parliament, and the\r\nsupport of the country should be called for, to this new scheme of\r\npolicy; and a commanding force should be sent, in order to carry it into\r\nexecution. But I recommend the noble viscount well to consider the\r\nlength of time which must elapse before these operations can be brought\r\nto a conclusion; the expense which must, in the first instance, be\r\nincurred; and the lengthened period which must elapse before the troops\r\ncan be withdrawn, and the other expenses can be discontinued, which must\r\nbe incurred if this scheme be undertaken. The noble lord must establish\r\na government in Spain; he must have the assistance of a Spanish army;\r\nand he must pay, equip, and provide for, not only his majesty's troops,\r\nbut every Spanish officer and soldier employed in the settlement of the\r\ngovernment of the country. It may be said, that there are financial\r\nresources in Spain; but I am much mistaken, regarding the state of the\r\nSpanish military establishments and Spanish finances, if there are not\r\nnon-effective establishments, such as pensions, retired allowances,\r\nexpenses of garrisons, and others, which will consume the whole of the\r\npecuniary resources of Spain, however well managed, even without\r\nincluding the interest of the existing debt. I think that, if this\r\ncountry should have this matter fairly brought under its view, it would\r\nnot be thought advisable to enter upon the scheme proposed in this\r\npamphlet. But we are told that France ought to act this part; and that\r\nwe ought to give France our moral support. France act! At whose expense?\r\nFrance would have the same difficulties--nay, greater difficulties--than\r\nthis country. Is it intended that we are to subsidise France? No such\r\nthing; we are to assist with our ships and marines on the coast, but it\r\nis France that is to carry on the operations in the interior, and pay\r\nthis expense. Is it believed that Louis Philippe has lost his senses? If\r\nwe cannot expect that France will pay all this expense, what is to\r\nbecome of the integrity of the Spanish dominions, and the independence\r\nof the Spanish government, after the operations shall he concluded?\r\n\r\n_April_ 21,1837.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Necessity of Conciliating the Protestants of Ireland_.\r\n\r\nMy anxious wish, my lords, has always been--and I have frankly stated it\r\nmore than once in my place in this house--that the Protestants of\r\nIreland should be on the best terms with the government of this country,\r\nand that the government should give them every protection and support in\r\nits power. My firm opinion is, that the safety of this country in\r\nconnection with Ireland, the safety of the union, the permanence of the\r\nunion, and, indeed, the honour of the empire, all depend, in a great\r\nmeasure, if not entirely, on the good understanding which may subsist\r\nbetween the government and the Protestants of Ireland. I am also certain\r\nthat the prosperity of the Protestants in Ireland, and the safety of\r\ntheir persons, of their riches, and of everything dear to men, depend on\r\ntheir being on terms of good understanding with the government; but that\r\nthings will not go on as they ought to go on, until government induces\r\nthe Protestants of that country to return to that good understanding.\r\nThat has been my opinion ever since the commencement of these\r\nunfortunate dissensions, seven years ago; and I should be sorry to say,\r\nthis evening, one word which might be calculated to increase the\r\nirritation now existing between both these parties. The noble viscount\r\n(Melbourne) has admitted that the Protestants of Ireland have great\r\nreason to feel the awkwardness of their present position, and to\r\nentertain jealousy of the government; and I must own that the noble\r\nviscount, instead of aggravating that description of feeling which he\r\nadmits the Protestants of Ireland ought to have, should use, as I\r\nconceive, every exertion in his power to conciliate them, and to make\r\nthem feel that they may depend upon the government for the protection of\r\ntheir lives and property, and that they will not be sacrificed to those\r\nwho are preaching up sedition against the institutions of their country,\r\nand insurrections against the persons and property of her people. These\r\nProtestants are in number not less than 2,000,000. I believe they hold,\r\nmy lords, about nine-tenths of the property of Ireland; and I am sure\r\nthat they are persons of the best education and of the best conduct in\r\nthat country. I believe that the province in which they reside is as\r\nwell cultivated and as well conducted in every respect as any portion of\r\nEngland; and the inhabitants of it deserve on every account all the\r\nprotection which the government can afford them. Let us see, my lords,\r\nwhether they have not reason to feel jealousy of the government in\r\nconsequence of the transactions of the last few years. Look at the total\r\ndestruction of the property of tithe--look at the treatment of their\r\nchurch--look at the various occurrences which have taken place, and see\r\nwhether they have not reason to apprehend that there is a latent\r\nintention of putting down the Protestant livings in Ireland, and of\r\nsubstituting a voluntary system in place of their present church\r\nestablishment. Do you suppose that men of their description do not\r\ncalculate on the events which are likely to happen? Do you suppose that\r\nthey do not read the history of past times? We have heard the noble\r\nviscount talking of the history of the year 1782, and of the year 1798,\r\nand of various other transactions. Let us look at the letters of Henry\r\nLord Clarendon, formerly chief governor of Ireland; and, having looked\r\nat them, let any man ask himself whether the Protestants of Ireland have\r\nnot a right to conceive that matters are advancing rapidly to the state\r\ndescribed by that noble personage, and whether the same description of\r\npower is not now growing up which exercised so enormous an influence on\r\nthe government of his day. I consider that the statements made by the\r\ndifferent peers who have spoken to night from this (the conservative)\r\nside of the house ought to have, and I trust they will have, a powerful\r\neffect on the Protestant mind of this country. At the same time that\r\nthese statements are brought forward, and the facts are made known to\r\nthe public, showing that neither property nor life is secure in Ireland,\r\nhis majesty comes down to parliament with a speech, in which he says,\r\n\"Ireland is in a state of tranquillity;\" and yet there is not one\r\ngentleman residing in Ireland who was not aware, when that speech was\r\ndelivered, that a general association had been formed and was in\r\nexistence in Dublin for the sole purpose of agitation--of that agitation\r\nwhich, as Lord Wellesley told the country, was the cause of disturbances\r\nas undoubtedly as any one circumstance ever was the cause of another. Do\r\nyour lordships suppose that the Protestants of Ireland are not aware of\r\nthat fact?\r\n\r\n_April_ 28,1837.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Lord Normanby's Gaol Deliveries_.\r\n\r\nWhat was the next step of which the Protestants of Ireland complained?\r\nThe lord lieutenant, they say, went into the country, from place to\r\nplace, without having any communication either with the judges or with\r\nthe magistrates;--and that is a fact on which I greatly rely--the lord\r\nlieutenant, they say, released at every county gaol which he visited a\r\ncertain number of prisoners. I have said, that the Protestants of\r\nIreland have a very peculiar interest in the impartial administration of\r\nthe law, and in the tranquillity of the country, because they form the\r\ngreat body of its landed proprietors. They must look at such a\r\ntransaction with jealousy; and if there had been no circumstances\r\nconnected with such a transaction save those which have been stated this\r\nevening, it must, I think, be admitted, that if the conduct of the lord\r\nlieutenant was not without precedent (and I believe that no precedent\r\ncan he found for it) it has yet been still of such rare occurrence that\r\nit ought never to be repeated. I do not mean to say that this power of\r\nenlarging prisoners has never been exercised, but I maintain that it had\r\nnever previously been exercised in such a manner. I do not pretend to be\r\nacquainted with the technicalities of the law on this subject; but it\r\noccurs to me that several of the persons who have been released in this\r\npeculiar manner by the lord lieutenant, had surely been guilty of\r\nfelony. I do not know exactly what the state of the law is, at present,\r\nupon this subject, but I apprehend that persons who have been found\r\nguilty of felony ought to have some document conveying their pardon, or\r\nin default of its production they become, I believe, liable to certain\r\nfines and forfeitures. But in the present case persons guilty of felony\r\nhave been enlarged without any writing at all, at the simple order of\r\nthe lord lieutenant, I must say, that a proceeding of this sort is\r\nhighly irregular, and that it is such an exercise of power as a lord\r\nlieutenant in the ordinary discharge of his duty ought not to repeat;\r\nand further, that this was an exercise of power which was most likely to\r\nproduce a very pernicious effect on the minds of the Protestants of\r\nIreland.\r\n\r\n_April_ 28, 1837.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Objections to the Irish Corporations Bill of 1837_.\r\n\r\nI stated, on a former occasion, that these corporations existed in\r\ntheir present shape, and were brought to their present state,\r\nprincipally with a view to the support and protection of the religion of\r\nthe Church of England established in Ireland. Whatever may be done with\r\nrespect to these corporations for the future, in my opinion that object\r\nought never to be lost sight of. It may be doubted, from what has lately\r\noccurred in this country, whether that opinion is so unanimously adopted\r\nas it was in former years; but I may venture to say, the support of the\r\nChurch of England in Ireland is still the policy of this country--the\r\npolicy which his majesty is sworn to maintain--the policy which this\r\nhouse is called, by writs of summons, to uphold--the policy which every\r\nmember of this, or the other house of parliament, is sworn to uphold by\r\nthe oaths which he has voluntarily taken. Under these circumstances, I\r\nthink I may safely say that, according to the ancient constitution,\r\naccording to the modern constitution, according to the uniform policy of\r\nthis country for the last 300 years, the maintenance of the Church of\r\nEngland in Ireland forms a prominent and important point of legislative\r\nconcern. Looking to this bill now under consideration, in relation\r\nprincipally to that policy, it goes undoubtedly to establish a very\r\nlarge number of corporations in Ireland, the mode of their formation\r\nbeing to give votes to the very lowest class of the population of the\r\ntowns in which these corporations are to be formed. This is to be done,\r\nnot upon evidence of their possessing property--not, as in England, upon\r\nresidence, upon the payment of rates, or on the evidence of their\r\npossessing anything in the nature of property; but simply on the\r\ncondition that the parties possess a 5l. or a 10l. qualification, made\r\nup of all kinds and descriptions of property put together, and this\r\nwithout any proof whatever, excepting the oath of the parties\r\nthemselves, of their possessing even that qualification. It is well\r\nknown to your lordships that a system of perjury prevails in all parts\r\nof Ireland, with a view to establish franchise of this description. I\r\nhave recently seen accounts of enquiries before select committees in\r\ncertain parliamentary elections which have taken place in that country,\r\nand it is impossible to glance at them without being impressed with the\r\nconviction that, if any description of franchise depend solely on the\r\noaths of the holders, every species of enquiry will be nugatory; and it\r\nwill be just as wise to establish at once a system of universal\r\nsuffrage, as to establish a system of franchise in such a manner. These\r\ncorporations, thus formed by persons holding a franchise of this\r\ndescription, acquired solely by their own swearing, and without any\r\nevidence whatever of their possessing any property except their own\r\noaths, establish a system upon which no reliance can be placed, and on\r\nwhich no establishment whatever can safely depend. If your lordships\r\nwant any proof of the danger to the church of Ireland by the\r\nestablishment of corporations of this description, I will refer your\r\nlordships to the declarations, I would not say of those who are the\r\ndeclared enemies, but I must say, the strongest opponents of the church,\r\nand who are found, on every occasion, making the greatest possible\r\nexertions against the church in Ireland, These persons are heard\r\ndeclaring publicly and repeatedly, almost under the very view of the\r\ngovernment--\"Give us but this corporation bill, and all the rest must\r\nfollow.\" If there be any doubt about it, I beg to say, I shall not be\r\ndisposed to listen to the threats of any man; but when my own senses\r\nconvince me that such must be the result, I mean danger to the\r\nestablishment, I do say it is my duty to attend to warnings of the\r\ndescription to which I have adverted.\r\n\r\n_May 5, 1837._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Eulogium on King William the Fourth._\r\n\r\nI have served his late majesty in the highest situations; I have been in\r\nhis council as well as the noble viscount (Melbourne). I, indeed, did\r\nnot serve him so long as the noble viscount, or even under any such\r\nprosperous circumstances as the noble viscount; but I have had\r\nopportunities of witnessing, under all these circumstances, the personal\r\nadvantages of character so ably described by the noble viscount. It has\r\nfallen to my lot to serve his majesty at different periods, and in\r\ndifferent capacities; and, while I had the happiness of doing so, upon\r\nall those occasions I have witnessed not only all the virtues ascribed\r\nto him by the noble viscount, but likewise a firmness, a discretion, a\r\ncandour, a justice, and a spirit of conciliation towards others,--a\r\nrespect for all. Probably there never was a sovereign who, in such\r\ncircumstances and encompassed by so many difficulties, more successfully\r\nmet them than he did upon every occasion on which he had to engage\r\nthem. I was induced to serve his majesty, not only from my sense of\r\nduty--not alone from the feeling that the sovereign of this country has\r\nthe right to command my services in any situation in which it might be\r\nconsidered that I might be of use--but from a feeling of gratitude to\r\nhis majesty for favours, for personal distinctions, conferred upon me,\r\nnotwithstanding that I had been unfortunately in the position of\r\nopposing myself to his majesty's views and intentions when he was\r\nemployed in a high situation under government,[19] and in consequence of\r\nwhich he had to resign that great office which he must, beyond all\r\nothers, have been most anxious to retain. Notwithstanding that, my\r\nlords, he employed me in his service; and he, as a sovereign, manifested\r\ntowards me a kindness, condescension, and favour, which, so long as I\r\nlive, I never can forget. I considered myself, then, not only bound by\r\nduty, and the sense I felt of gratitude to all the sovereigns of this\r\ncountry, under whom I had lived, but more especially towards his late\r\nmajesty, to relieve him from every difficulty I could, under any\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: William the Fourth, when Duke of Clarence, was under the\r\nnecessity of resigning the office of Lord High Admiral, while the Duke\r\nof Wellington was premier.]\r\n\r\n_June_ 22, 1837.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Agrarian Disturbances in Ireland are earned by Political Agitation_.\r\n\r\nThe noble earl opposite has stated, that the tranquillity mentioned in\r\nher majesty's speech from the throne, on opening the present parliament,\r\nwas not intended to mean judicial or agrarian tranquillity, but\r\npolitical tranquillity. And what is the sort of political tranquillity\r\nexisting in Ireland? I believe that a very few days before the speech in\r\nwhich the word tranquillity is used was delivered, the association which\r\nwas assembled in the capital of Ireland, under the eyes of the noble\r\nearl opposite, was dissolved; but, at the same time, her majesty was\r\ngiven to understand, that she was not to have the choice of her\r\nministers, but that they must be selected by the gentleman who was the\r\nfounder and the head of that association. Now, to talk of\r\ntranquillity--political tranquillity--in any part of that country,\r\nlooking at the situation in which it is placed, is vague and idle. The\r\nnoble earl has said, that the agrarian disturbances in Ireland are not\r\nto be attributed to political agitation. Now, one of the greatest\r\nauthorities that ever appeared in this or any other country--a noble\r\nrelation of mine--stated, that \"agrarian disturbances in Ireland were to\r\nbe attributed to political agitation, and to nothing else, as much as\r\neffect was to be attributed to cause in any instance whatever.\" I say,\r\nthen, that in Ireland they have agrarian disturbances because they have\r\npolitical agitations.\r\n\r\n_November_ 27, 1837.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Principle of Imprisonment for Debt_.\r\n\r\nOne of the causes of debts being incurred in this country is, in a great\r\ndegree, the power which creditors at present possess to arrest their\r\ndebtors upon _mesne_ process; and I still further believe that it is the\r\nfacility which is thus given of obtaining credit, that has been the\r\ncause of the great mercantile prosperity of the country. The enormous\r\ntransactions upon credit are such, that both individuals and the public\r\ngenerally, require further means of recovering debts than exist in\r\nother countries.\r\n\r\n_December_ 5,1837.\r\n\r\n_The Case of Dr. Hampden_.\r\n\r\nThe late king was advised to appoint that gentleman to be Regius\r\nProfessor of Divinity in the university of Oxford. There can be no doubt\r\nthat the general opinion of the university was, that that gentleman's\r\ntheological tenets were not exactly orthodox, or consistent with the\r\narticles of the church of England,--an opinion which the publication of\r\ncertain works by that gentleman has tended to establish.\r\n\r\nSeveral persons in the university considered it their duty to petition\r\nhis majesty, praying, if the appointment had not been completed, that he\r\nwould not make it. I believe that another address was presented to his\r\nmajesty, entreating his majesty not to sanction that appointment, which,\r\nhowever, was made, contrary to the views of the university at large; and\r\na short time afterwards, Dr. Hampden thought right, in his inaugural\r\nlecture, to state that he then felt it his duty to explain the opinions\r\nwhich had been complained of. I do not pretend to be a judge either of\r\nthose opinions or that explanation; but this I will venture to say, and\r\nI believe your lordships will concur in the opinion, that in proportion\r\nas Dr. Hampden found it necessary to give an explanation of his\r\nsentiments, in the same proportion were those justified who thought\r\nproper to disapprove of them. I believe it will be admitted that, if a\r\nclergyman who published certain opinions, not being orthodox, thought\r\nproper to come forward and explain those opinions, at least they who\r\nwere opposed to such opinions had some justification, on their being\r\nrepeated, for the course they had taken in disapproving of them. This is\r\nall I wish to say respecting the opinions and explanation of Dr.\r\nHampden. His appointment having been made, notwithstanding the petition\r\nof a vast number of the clergy of Oxford, and the general opinion\r\nexpressed there that it should not be made, a request was preferred to\r\nthe heads of houses that they would propose some measure to the\r\nconvocation which would have the effect of marking the disapprobation on\r\nthe part of that body of the opinions and appointment of Dr. Hampden.\r\nThe noble earl has alluded to the act of convocation excluding Dr.\r\nHampden from being one of those to appoint the select preachers, and\r\nalso from sitting at the board of heresy. I am not disposed to say\r\nanything against Dr. Hampden; but this I must say, that, considering the\r\nwhole transaction, my opinion is, the convocation did as little upon\r\nthat occasion as it was possible to do, consistently with the necessity\r\nwhich existed of taking some notice of that gentleman, his opinions and\r\nconduct. Since that period, I really believe that the university, and\r\nthe bishops of the church of England, and all the persons who have any\r\ninfluence on this question, have done everything in their power to put\r\nit down, and prevent it becoming a subject of discussion, even in the\r\nuniversity or elsewhere. For myself, I can say, I have invariably\r\npursued that course, it being my object to prevent any discussion on the\r\nmatter; and I never should have mentioned it, here or elsewhere,\r\npublicly, if the noble earl had not forced it upon me on the present\r\noccasion. I certainly lament the transaction, principally because I\r\nconsider it is likely to produce a schism in the church; and I have been\r\nas anxious as any man can be in my situation, to prevent the university\r\nfrom proceeding on the subject in such a manner as may, by possibility,\r\nlead to that result.\r\n\r\nThe noble earl adverted to the conduct of a gentleman who is now\r\nvice-chancellor of the university, and who has, in his capacity of head\r\nof a house, prohibited the attendance of the students in divinity upon\r\nthe lectures of the Regius Professor. I do not at all pretend to be\r\ncompetent to mark the difference between the private and public lectures\r\nof the Regius Professor; but I certainly do not approve of the course\r\ntaken by that gentleman. In my opinion, the question is not one to be\r\nconsidered by the head of a house; for, in fact, no ordination can be\r\nconferred by him or the Regius Professor of Divinity. Ordination can\r\nonly be conferred by the bishops of the church; and whether the students\r\nattend the lectures of the Regius Professor of Divinity, or those of the\r\nMargaret Professor, or of any other professor, I will say, it is the\r\nduty of the bishops of the church to consider who are the persons coming\r\nfor ordination, and whether they are qualified or not, without taking\r\ninto consideration the certificates of the Regius Professor of Divinity,\r\nthe head of a house, or any other individual. It is, I contend, the\r\nduty of the bishops to examine into the subject themselves, without\r\nreference to the certificate of any individual whatever. I must observe,\r\nhowever, with regard to the course adopted by the vice-chancellor, that\r\nI am thoroughly convinced, not only from what that gentleman has stated\r\nto me, but from my knowledge of that gentleman's conduct, and his\r\ncharacter for candour and fairness, that he had the very wisest motives\r\nin pursuing that course, from which he departed as soon as he found that\r\nthe bishops of the church had determined upon observing a different\r\nline, conceiving that he was then relieved from all charge and\r\nresponsibility in the situation which he held. Such is the history of\r\nthat transaction; and I have only to say, with respect to that\r\ngentleman, and with respect to others of the university of Oxford, that\r\nit was their anxious wish and desire to avoid taking any step in\r\nreference to Dr. Hampden, lest it should, in any manner whatever, lead\r\nto what they would consider the greatest possible misfortune--a schism\r\nin the church.\r\n\r\n_December_ 21,1837.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA great country cannot wage a little war.\r\n\r\n_January_ 16, 1838.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Conduct of the Canadian Leaders._\r\n\r\nI differ entirely from the noble and learned lord in thinking that the\r\nact of 1831 established the British constitution in Canada, for it is\r\nnot consistent with the British constitution to leave the civil\r\ngovernment of the country--and especially to leave the judges of the\r\nland--to be provided for by an annual vote of the parliament. I say, my\r\nlords, that the British constitution, for the last hundred and fifty\r\nyears at least, has made a fixed and not uncertain provision for\r\nsupporting the dignity of the crown, for meeting the expenses attendant\r\non the administration of the civil government, and most particularly for\r\nthe independence of the judges of the land. But is that the state of\r\nthings in Lower Canada? No. I maintain that the act of 1831 did not\r\nestablish the British constitution in the colonies of Upper and Lower\r\nCanada, but something quite distinct; for it gave to the people a\r\npopular representation, which, in my opinion, is the cause of all the\r\ndisputes that have followed, and of the insurrection which has taken\r\nplace. It gave individuals the power to create prejudices in the minds\r\nof the people, to weaken the loyalty of the Canadians, and to raise them\r\nin hostility against her majesty's crown and government. And what has\r\nbeen the object of these individuals in the course which they have\r\npursued? They have supposed that, by creating dissatisfaction amongst\r\nthe people, they could thereby throw off the authority of the crown;\r\nand, by gathering the people around them, overturn the government\r\nestablished in the colony. Such have been the objects of those\r\nindividuals who have been seen running off to the neighbouring\r\nterritories of the United States as soon as they found their own persons\r\nexposed to danger. This turned out to be the real state of the case; for\r\nthe would-be leaders left the unfortunate people in a state of rebellion\r\nagainst her majesty's government, and ran off themselves, letting the\r\nunlucky inhabitants return to their houses as best they could; and\r\nforcing them to submit, with the best grace they might, to the mercy of\r\nher majesty's government.\r\n\r\n_January 18, 1838._\r\n\r\n_Evils of popular Rights_.\r\n\r\nI warned the noble lord against endangering the establishments of the\r\ncountry, by giving anything like an authority to a popular assembly to\r\nwithhold the funds necessary for carrying on the civil government; for\r\nnothing is more needful to a country than to uphold the civil power, and\r\nthe independence--as well pecuniary as political--of the judges of the\r\nland. And let noble lords learn, from the events in Canada, and other\r\ndominions in North America, what it is to hold forth what are called\r\n\"popular rights,\" but which are not popular rights either here or\r\nelsewhere; and what occasion is thereby given to the perpetuation of a\r\nsystem of agitation which ends in insurrection and rebellion, and the\r\ncoming to blows with her majesty's troops.\r\n\r\n_January_ 18,1838.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Importance of reducing the Canadian Rebels_.\r\n\r\nI confess, my lords, that I have a feeling for the honour of my country,\r\nand I cannot but believe that if, by any misfortune, we should fail in\r\nrestoring peace in Lower Canada, at an early period of time, we shall\r\nreceive a blow, with respect to our military character, to our\r\nreputation, and to our honour, of which it will require years to enable\r\nus to remove the effects.\r\n\r\n_January_ 18,1838.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_An Elective Legislative Council in Canada deprecated_.\r\n\r\nMy lords, there is one topic which has been adverted to by the noble and\r\nlearned lord (Lord Brougham), upon which I think it necessary to say a\r\nword, although it is not alluded to in the address, and will more\r\nproperly form a subject of the discussion on the bill which is to be\r\nbrought in upon some future day--and that is the establishment in Lower\r\nCanada of an elective legislative council. The noble and learned lord,\r\nwith all his knowledge of Lower Canada, has not, in my opinion,\r\nsufficiently adverted to the fact of the difference of the two races of\r\ninhabitants in that country. My lords, it may be easy to talk, here, of\r\nestablishing an elective council, but if the noble and learned lord will\r\nlook into the discussions which have taken place upon that subject, and\r\nto the opinions that have been delivered upon it by the different\r\nparties, in that colony, he will find that British inhabitants are to\r\nthe full as much opposed to that arrangement as the French are in favour\r\nof it, he will find that in point of fact, they would be in a state of\r\ninsurrection against that arrangement, in the same degree as the French\r\nare now supposed to be in a state of insurrection in favour of an\r\nelective legislative council. I will likewise beg the noble and learned\r\nlord, and I would entreat the noble viscount opposite, and every member\r\nof her majesty's government, to attend to this fact, that an elective\r\nlegislative council is not the constitution of the British monarchy;\r\nthat a legislative council appointed by the monarch is the constitution\r\nof this country; that this was so stated in the discussions upon the\r\nbill passed in the year 1791, by all the great authorities who discussed\r\nthat measure, amongst others by Mr. Fox himself. That gentleman said,\r\n\"that a legislative council, appointed by the monarch, is an essential\r\npart of the British constitution.\"\r\n\r\n_January_ 18, 1838.\r\n\r\n_Concessions to Democracy cannot be rescinded._\r\n\r\nYour lordships ought also to recollect that, since the passing of the\r\nreform bill, the taxes required from householders paying 10l. of yearly\r\nrent have been greatly reduced, and I believe that the poor-rates have\r\nalso been diminished. These reductions have afforded great relief to\r\nthat particular class of persons, greater than has been given to any\r\nother portion of society; and I think that, under the circumstances, the\r\namount of qualification ought not to be further diminished, for, if it\r\nbe, a worse description of electors will be the inevitable consequence.\r\nI perfectly recollect that a noble friend of mine, whom I do not now see\r\nin his place, warned your lordships, on a former occasion, of the danger\r\nof making any approach to democracy in a measure like this; and he told\r\nyour lordships that, if once such a measure was adopted, you could never\r\nturn back from it. If it be found, when carried into operation, to act\r\never so injuriously--if its tendency be found to be ever so destructive\r\nto the peace and well-being of society--still you cannot fall back on\r\nthe point from which you started; for, if once granted, the measure must\r\nbe permanent.\r\n\r\n_March 8, 1838._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Short-sighted Conduct of the West Indian Colonists._\r\n\r\nThere is no man in this house, or in the country, who has been more\r\nanxious than myself, that the measure passed for the abolition of\r\nslavery should be entirely successful. I have, however, conceived from\r\nthe first, that the only chance of its success would arise from the\r\ncolonial legislatures acting with good faith, and carrying the measure,\r\nafter it had passed the imperial parliament, into strict execution; for\r\nwhich measure they have received what they acknowledge, by their\r\nadhesion to the principle of the bill, a competent compensation. It\r\nappears, however, to be beyond doubt, that they have not carried the new\r\nsystem into execution as they ought to have done; and some two or three\r\nyears ago, your lordships were under the necessity of consenting to a\r\nbill, rendered necessary in consequence of the legislature of Jamaica\r\nhaving refused, under not very creditable circumstances, to enact a law\r\nwhich it had positively promised to pass. Under these circumstances,\r\nconsidering that we are now approaching to within a couple of years of\r\nthe period when a new state of society is to be established in all the\r\nBritish possessions where slavery has ever existed, I must say, I think\r\nparliament ought not to hesitate about adopting some measure of the\r\ndescription now proposed, for the purpose of carrying into full and\r\ncomplete execution the object which the imperial legislature had in view\r\nwhen the emancipation act was passed. It appears to me, that if the\r\nlegislatures of the colonies had acted as sensible men ought to have\r\ndone, in the circumstances in which they were placed four years ago,\r\nthey would have had before them, and the British parliament would have\r\nhad before it, a very different prospect from that which, I fear,\r\nexists at the present moment.\r\n\r\n_March_ 13, 1838.\r\n\r\n_Lord Melbourne's Government Inimical to the Church._\r\n\r\nIt appears that the policy of her majesty's government is--I will use\r\nthe mildest term that can be employed--not to encourage the established\r\nchurch. I am afraid that it will appear from what passed in another\r\nplace, in the last session of parliament, and even in this, that the\r\nchurch of England--the established church of England--is not to be\r\nencouraged by her majesty's government. I am sure that those who\r\nrecollect what has occurred in parliament, during the last few years,\r\nwill admit that no great encouragement has been shown by ministers to\r\nthe church of Ireland, that branch of the established church of England\r\nwhich is stationed in the latter country. I say therefore, my lords,\r\nthat this is the policy of the government of this country; and, I must\r\nown, also, it is most sincerely to be lamented by every friend of the\r\nconstitution, and of the peace, order, and happiness of the community.\r\n\r\n_March 30, 1838._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_A Free Press in Malta deprecated._\r\n\r\nNow, in regard to this matter of a free press in Malta, I crave your\r\nlordships' attention to the facts of the case for a moment, and I beg\r\nthe house to bear them in mind. What is Malta? It is a fortress and a\r\nseaport--it is a great naval and military arsenal for our shipping and\r\nforces in the Mediterranean. We hold it by conquest. We hold it as an\r\nimportant post, as a great military and naval arsenal, and as nothing\r\nmore. My lords, if these are the facts, we might as well think of\r\nplanting a free press on the fore deck of the admiral's flag-ship in the\r\nMediterranean, or on the caverns of the batteries of Gibraltar, or in\r\nthe camp of Sir John Colborne in Canada, as of establishing it in Malta.\r\nA free press in Malta in the Italian language is an absurdity. Of the\r\nhundred thousand individuals who compose the population of Malta,\r\nthree-fourths at least speak nothing but the Maltese dialect, and do not\r\nunderstand the Italian language. Of the one hundred thousand inhabitants\r\nof the island, at least three-fourths can neither read nor write. What\r\nadvantages, then, can accrue to the people of Malta from the\r\nestablishment of a free press? We do not want to teach our English\r\nsailors and soldiers to understand Italian. A free press will find no\r\nreaders among them either. Who, then, is it for? These gentlemen say,\r\nthat, unless the government support a free press in Malta, it cannot\r\nexist of itself, and they suggest an expense of £800 a year in its\r\nfavour. They have done nothing more than this that I am aware of since\r\ntheir appointment, and it is plain, that the savings spoken of by the\r\nnoble baron as having been effected by their recommendation are\r\ncompletely swallowed up by the project of a free press. My lords, I\r\ncannot help thinking that it is wholly unnecessary and greatly\r\nunbecoming of the government to form such an establishment, of such a\r\ndescription, in such a place as Malta; and the more particularly, as the\r\nobject for which it is made, must be both of a dangerous tendency to\r\nthis country, and fraught with evil to others. The free press which they\r\npropose, is to be conducted, not by foreign Italians, but by Maltese,\r\nsubjects of her majesty, enjoying the same privileges as we do. Now,\r\nwhat does this mean? It means that the licence to do wrong is unlimited.\r\nIf it were conducted by foreign Italians, you could have a check upon\r\nthem if they acted in such a manner as would tend to compromise us with\r\nour neighbours--you could send them out of the island--you could prevent\r\ntheir doing injury in that manner by various ways. But here you have no\r\nsuch check--you have no check at all--your free press in that respect is\r\nuncontrollable. If the free press chooses to preach up insurrection in\r\nItaly from its den in Malta, you have no power of preventing it. Were\r\nthe conductors foreign Italians you could lay your hand on them at once,\r\nand dispose of them as aliens; but you cannot do that with the Maltese\r\nsubjects, enjoying the same right and possessing the same freedom as\r\nourselves. I did hope, that we should have been cured by this time of\r\nour experiments on exciting insurrection in the other countries of\r\nEurope--in the dominions of neighbouring princes--in the territories of\r\nour allies. I did think that we had received a sufficient lesson in\r\nthese matters to last us a long time, even for ever, in the results\r\nwhich have taken place through such interference in Portugal, Spain,\r\nItaly--ay, and in Canada too--and that they had put an end to our\r\ndangerous mania for exciting insurrection in foreign countries. Such, my\r\nlords, I assert is the object of a free press in Malta--to excite\r\ninsurrection in the dominions of our neighbour and ally, the King of the\r\nTwo Sicilies, and in the dominions of the King of Sardinia--and I\r\nconfess that I am ashamed of the government, considering the results\r\nthat have taken place, from the doctrines promulgated by it, that they\r\nhave not done everything in their power to suppress instead of\r\nencouraging and supporting it; and that they had not sent out their\r\ncommissions with full power to do so, rather than instructed them to\r\ncall for its establishment.\r\n\r\n_May 3, 1838._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_State of Poverty in Ireland._\r\n\r\nOf all the countries in Europe, Ireland is the one in which it has\r\nappeared to me to be least possible to establish anything in the nature\r\nof the English poor-laws. The opinion delivered by others has been, that\r\nthere are no materials to be found in Ireland proper for forming, or if\r\nformed for administering with salutary effect, any system of poor-laws\r\nsuch as exists in this country; and I, my lords, believe that there is\r\nno doubt whatever of the justice and truth of that opinion, considering\r\nthe English poor-laws, as they formerly existed, and as they were\r\ncarried into execution up to the year 1834, when the noble lords\r\nopposite introduced the measure which amended them. While, however, I\r\nsay this, I am bound at the same time to express my entire concurrence\r\nin the opinion declared by the noble viscount, that there never was a\r\ncountry in which poverty existed to such a degree as it exists in that\r\npart of the United Kingdom. My lords, I was in office in that country--I\r\nheld a high situation in the administration of the government of Ireland\r\nthirty years ago--and I must say, that from that time to this there has\r\nscarcely elapsed a single year in which the government has not at\r\ncertain periods of it entertained the most serious apprehensions of\r\nactual famine. My lords, I am firmly convinced that from the year 1806\r\ndown to the present time, a year has not passed in which the government\r\nhave not been called on to give assistance to relieve the poverty and\r\ndistress which prevailed in Ireland, and owing to circumstances over\r\nwhich no human power could have any control. One of the circumstances\r\nwhich has most frequently led to this lamentable state of things, has\r\nbeen the failure or delay of the potato crops, and there have been known\r\ntimes when two, three, and even as many as four months have intervened\r\nbefore these crops, which are used as a subsistence by the people, could\r\nbe brought into the market; and such are the social relations in that\r\ncountry, that the people have no means of coming to market to purchase\r\nlike the people of England. My lords, this is a fact that is undoubted,\r\nand one that I believe never existed in any country in the world except\r\nIreland.\r\n\r\n_May 21, 1838._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The Numbers of a Meeting may render it Illegal._\r\n\r\nThe numbers of a meeting--that is to say, such an assembly of persons as\r\nwould create terror in the minds of people living in the\r\nneighbourhood,--would justify the magistrate in taking measures to\r\ndisperse it.\r\n\r\n_June 15, 1838._\r\n\r\n_Real cause of our interference in Spain._\r\n\r\nThe system of interference adopted by his late majesty's government, by\r\nmeans of the quadruple treaty, was with a view to the contest between\r\nextreme opinions--it was more with a view of aiding these extreme\r\nopinions, than to the arrangement of the mere differences between Don\r\nCarlos, upon the one side, and the queen, or her daughter, upon the\r\nother; to support certain opinions, and not to determine the succession,\r\nwas the cause of interference. I regret interference upon that ground; I\r\nobject to interference upon that ground; and I say, moreover, that we\r\nwere not right in interfering upon that ground. I maintain that, more\r\nparticularly on account of the extreme opinions that prevailed, we ought\r\nnot to have interfered at all; but most especially we ought not,\r\naccording to the common practice of this government, and in accordance\r\nwith the declared political principles of the noble lords themselves, to\r\nhave interfered in a question involving extreme political opinions. Now\r\nit has unfortunately happened that extreme political principles have\r\nbeen forced upon a great part of Europe by means of large armies and of\r\ngreat military forces, and it was consequently expected that the same\r\nthing would succeed in Spain. This, I believe, was the object of our\r\ninterference with Spain, and not to determine the Spanish succession.\r\n\r\n_June 19, 1838._\r\n\r\n_We had no right to interfere against Don Carlos._\r\n\r\nI say we had no business to interfere in the question of succession.\r\nThere might have been some pretext for interference in the question of\r\nsuccession, if any of the powers of Europe had taken part with Don\r\nCarlos, but that was not the case. The noble baron (Lord Holland)\r\ncheers. I say, confidently, that not one of the powers in Europe had\r\nstirred a finger in support of the pretensions of Don Carlos. I say,\r\nthen, that, according to all principles--the principles supported and\r\nacted upon by this country, in the case of the house of Braganza, and\r\nmany other cases that I could mention--we ought to have avoided\r\ninterference; and we ought to have avoided interference by armies more\r\nparticularly, in the contests in Spain. I say, my lords, that not a\r\nsword had been moved in Europe in favour of Don Carlos. When Don Carlos\r\nwent to Spain, in the summer of 1834, there were not three battalions in\r\narms in that country in his favour. This I positively state as a fact.\r\nBut, on the contrary, in the space of forty leagues there were forty\r\nfortified posts in possession of the queen's troops. Now, my lords, this\r\nis a positive fact; and I say that, in the year 1835, when the armistice\r\nwas negotiated, when the exchange of prisoners was negotiated by Lord\r\nEliot, Don Carlos had then acquired a superiority over the queen's\r\nforces, who were obliged to take up a position on the right of the Ebro.\r\nThat is to say, between the interval of time I have mentioned,--and this\r\nis a positive fact upon which your lordships may rely, and to which I\r\npledge my word,--between the summer of 1834 and the period at which the\r\nexchange of prisoners was agreed upon in 1835,--that is, in the course\r\nof a very few months,--the superiority had been gained by Don Carlos in\r\nthat part of the country, so far that he had forced the enemy to take up\r\na position on the other side of the Ebro, abandoning all their fortified\r\nposts, except Pampeluna and one other; and, I must add, they had very\r\nwisely abandoned them, because they found they could not march to their\r\nrelief through the country. Now, my lords, this is literally and truly a\r\nfact; and it is a fact not to be forgotten, with respect to the present\r\ncontest in Spain. I say, then, that it was the business of this\r\ngovernment not to have interfered by force. We ought not to have done\r\nso, according to the noble marquis's principle--that there ought to be\r\nno interference between two hostile parties in a nation like Spain.\r\n\r\n_June 19, 1838._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The Legion a failure._\r\n\r\nThe noble viscount has told your lordships, certainly, that he sent out\r\nan expedition; and the noble marquis has informed us that it has always\r\nbeen the policy of this country to encourage such expeditions. Now,\r\nwithout meaning to assert that the result of that expedition was a dire\r\ncatastrophe, I must be permitted to say that the legion has been, in my\r\nopinion and conviction, a complete failure. It has cost the Spanish\r\ngovernment an enormous sum of money. Great expectations were raised\r\nrespecting it, not one of which has been fulfilled. When the legion went\r\nto Spain, the Queen of Spain's army was in all the provinces, with the\r\nexception of Biscay and Navarre. Her government was established in all\r\nparts of Spain, excepting these places. Excepting them, all other places\r\nmight be said to be in a state of tranquillity. But it appears the Queen\r\nof Spain could not carry on the war, unless she got ten thousand Isle of\r\nDogsmen--a legion from England, and another from France. If the Spanish\r\ngovernment had asked for officers, or for arms, or for money, or for\r\nartillery, I should not have been surprised, as I know well the manner\r\nin which the Spanish arsenals are supplied. But asking for 10,000 men\r\nfrom England to destroy Don Carlos, who was shut up in the mountains,\r\nwas a matter really not to be seriously thought of. The object was not\r\nto bring 10,000, or 15,000, or 20,000 men into action, but to bring the\r\nred coats and the blue coats, the French and English troops, into the\r\ncontest; that was the object, and the view was, to produce a moral\r\neffect. But the government ought to have known that that which gave them\r\nthe influence on the one side, was fatal to that influence on the other.\r\nThus was an end put to that moral influence which this country could,\r\nand ought to have exerted, but which can only be effectually exercised\r\nby strict adherence, throughout all her proceedings, to the plain\r\nprinciples of justice. If this country enter into a treaty, let her\r\ncarry it honourably through; but let her not push her interference\r\nfurther than is necessary for exerting her influence over both parties,\r\nin order to settle existing differences. I have said that the legion was\r\na failure. Of that there cannot be the slightest doubt. The war is now\r\nin the same state as it was in the year 1835, except that Don Carlos has\r\nmore men.\r\n\r\n_June 19, 1838._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The Opposition should give aid to the Government when a war is\r\ninevitable._\r\n\r\nThe noble viscount tells us that we did not object to the appointment of\r\nthe Earl of Durham as governor-general of Canada--that we did not object\r\nto the powers confided to him; that we--referring particularly to\r\nme--urged this government by all the means in their power to send out\r\nlarge forces, and take care to be strong in that part of the world;\r\nadvice which, I admit, I did repeat over and over again, until I\r\nfatigued myself and the house by doing so. But why did I not object to\r\nthose powers being given to the Earl of Durham? Because, seeing the\r\ngovernment in difficulties--seeing the colony in a state of\r\nrebellion--and seeing that the government possessed confidence in\r\nanother place--I thought it was not my duty to excite opposition to\r\nmeasures which they thought it might be proper to adopt; and therefore I\r\ntook them all upon their recommendation. Very possibly I was wrong in so\r\ndoing; indeed, it appears that I was wrong; but I took the course which\r\nI then considered it my duty to take. I declared that I would not follow\r\nthe example of those who, being convinced of the certainty that the\r\ncountry would be involved in a war, yet thought proper to oppose all\r\nmeasures that were necessary for carrying on that war. Neither would I\r\ndeny assistance to those who were absent, and who were carrying on the\r\ngovernment to the best of their ability; but I would give the government\r\na fair support, in order to pacify a country which might be in a state\r\nof war or rebellion. That was the course which I followed on the\r\noccasion alluded to by the noble viscount. With respect to the Earl of\r\nDurham, I am personally unacquainted with him; and I considered that the\r\nnoble viscount and her majesty's government ought to have known best who\r\nwas the person most qualified to act as governor of Canada.\r\n\r\n_August 9, 1838._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Lord Durham's Ordinance[20] a grossly illegal Act._\r\n\r\nA grossly illegal act has been committed--not a mere technical error, or\r\none having reference to small or nice points of law, but an illegal act\r\nof great magnitude, and relating to points of the most grave\r\nimportance--an act so clearly illegal, that no man capable of\r\nunderstanding the first principles of justice can doubt of its\r\nimpropriety. It is impossible that the people of this country can suffer\r\nany man to be driven into banishment without trial, or that they can\r\nallow him, afterwards, to be condemned to death, without having been\r\nconvicted of any crime but that of returning to his own country.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: The Earl of Durham, governor-general of the Canadas, had\r\nissued an ordinance, transporting to Bermuda Dr. Nelson and seven\r\nothers, guilty by confession of high treason, and subjecting them to\r\ndeath if they returned to Canada. Lord Brougham, actuated, as was\r\nasserted by some, by personal feeling against Lord Durham, protested\r\nagainst this act in the face of the country. His speech on the occasion\r\nwas one of the most powerful he ever delivered. It is scarcely necessary\r\nto add that Lord Durham immediately and precipitately resigned his\r\ngovernorship.]\r\n\r\n_August 9, 1838._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Inadequacy of our Navy._\r\n\r\nThere is nothing more certain than that, if you come to be entirely\r\ndependent for corn on the countries bordering on the Baltic, you would\r\nhave the King of Prussia and the Emperor of Russia (as has been known\r\nbefore), levying a tax upon the exportation of that article of food to\r\nthe Thames, and elsewhere in this country. * * I entirely agree with the\r\nnoble and learned lord on the expediency of avoiding any interference\r\nwith foreign powers on the subject of commercial matters; but I confess\r\nthat I cannot view the state of our commercial relations, and of our\r\nposition in the world generally, in connection with these commercial\r\npursuits, with any degree of unmixed satisfaction. On the contrary, I do\r\ndeplore the state in which we find ourselves placed in many parts of the\r\nworld, particularly as it has been described in the course of the\r\nevening by my noble friend (Viscount Strangford). What I attribute that\r\nstate of our commercial relations to, in a great degree, is, the extreme\r\nweakness and tottering condition of our naval establishments. I do not\r\nmean to complain of the distribution of our naval establishments;\r\nthough, at the same time, I by no means intend to unsay what I have said\r\nin respect to the expeditions to Spain, which I cannot approve of; but I\r\nrepeat my expression that I consider our naval establishments to be in\r\ntoo weak and tottering a condition to answer the purpose for which they\r\nwere intended, which was to give protection to the commercial interests\r\nof the country in all parts of the world; for the commerce of England\r\ndoes extend to all parts of the world. There is not a port, not a river,\r\nwhich is not visited by the ships of her majesty's subjects; and her\r\nmajesty's subjects have an undoubted right to protection in whatever\r\npart of the world they may think proper to visit in the pursuits of\r\ncommerce. The circumstance of which I complain I do not at all attribute\r\nto neglect upon the part of the admiralty, neither do I include in my\r\ncensure the noble earl who is at the head of the admiralty; but those I\r\ndo blame are the individuals who have thought proper to reduce the\r\nestablishments of the country to such a degree, that protection cannot\r\npossibly be given in all places where it is required.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI will remind your lordships that, since the peace, and particularly\r\nwithin the last twenty years, three great navies have sprung up in\r\nEurope, which are four times as strong as they were at any former\r\nperiod. Other navies, it is true, are put down; but we remain much the\r\nsame. A great deal has been said, by way of comparison, between the\r\nstrength of our navy in 1792, and in the years 1814 and 1815; but when\r\nwe talk of strength in this case, we ought not to look at the subject\r\nwithout adverting to the naval establishments of other powers. Now,\r\nalthough our marine force should even be on the same footing as before,\r\nour commerce is not only tripled, but extended to a degree ten times\r\ngreater than it ever was before; and there is not a part of the earth,\r\nfrom one pole to the other, in which the protection of our navy is not\r\nrequired for our commerce. I must say that, if we should at any time\r\nincur the misfortune of being involved in another war--which God\r\nforbid!--the only mode of keeping out of the difficulty would be to\r\nmaintain such a navy as would give protection to her majesty's subjects\r\nin all parts of the globe.\r\n\r\n_August 14, 1838._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Neutrality of Belgium._\r\n\r\nI hope that it never may be lost sight of in this country, that the\r\noriginal foundation of the independence of Belgium, as a separate\r\nkingdom, was this condition, namely, its perpetual neutrality. That\r\ncondition I consider to have been the foundation of that transaction,\r\nand I hope that this will never be forgotten by this country, or by\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n_February 5, 1839._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Aggressions on Canada from the United States._\r\n\r\nI must say I should very much wish to see suitable measures adopted to\r\ncarry into execution the intentions which her majesty declares in her\r\nspeech, of maintaining her rights of sovereignty over Canada. The system\r\nof levying private war which prevails on that continent is not wholly\r\nunknown in other parts of the world. I have read of it as existing in\r\nthe deserts of Central Asia; I have heard of its being practised, as a\r\nsystem, by the Asiatics on the frontiers of the Russian monarchy, where\r\na perpetual warfare is going on between those tribes and the troops sent\r\nto repress their inroads--a warfare that has been waged in those\r\ncountries from century to century. We read also of circumstances of the\r\nsame kind occurring in Africa--of wars carried on by barbarous tribes\r\nagainst the possessions of the British government in Africa, the\r\ncontests of savages against a civilized people. But this is a war\r\ncarried on by a nation supposed to be considerably advanced in the scale\r\nof civilization--by men governing themselves, electing their servants by\r\nballot and general suffrage, and living under institutions of that\r\ndescription. Yet these are the very men who come in at night, and with\r\nfire and torch destroy the property of her majesty's subjects, for no\r\nreason whatever except that they obey her majesty's laws, and carry into\r\neffect her royal commands. Of such a system of warfare there are, I\r\nbelieve, no examples, except, as I have stated, among the most lawless\r\nof the barbarous tribes of the East and of Africa. It is quite out of\r\nthe question that her majesty's loyal subjects, invited to their\r\nhabitations, and fixed in them, by her majesty's authority and that of\r\nher predecessors, should not endeavour to retaliate the sufferings thus\r\ninflicted upon them, unless protected by the strong arm of government;\r\nbut how can government protect them, except by taking strong measures,\r\nwhen these persons are found invading her majesty's dominions for the\r\npurpose of plundering and destroying the property of her majesty's\r\nsubjects, to intercept them in their retreat, to take them prisoners,\r\nand punish them according to the laws of the country they have insulted?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt a civil government in any country is capable of\r\npreventing the collection of a body of troops, and the invasion of the\r\nterritory of a neighbouring power. A body of \"sympathisers\" has been\r\norganised in the States to carry on the plan of invasion; and are we to\r\nsit down quietly and pass unnoticed this unwarrantable interference?\r\n\r\n_February 5, 1839._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Agitation by Authority._\r\n\r\nI now come to the last paragraph of the speech, in which her majesty\r\ncomplains, that she has observed with pain the efforts which have been\r\nmade, in some parts of the country, to excite her subjects to\r\ndisobedience and resistance to the law, and to recommend dangerous and\r\nillegal acts. Now, I really think that this affecting paragraph cannot\r\nhave raised very pleasant reflections in the breasts of many noble lords\r\nwho are in the habit of supporting her majesty's ministers. It is but\r\ntoo true that various persons have endeavoured to excite her majesty's\r\nsubjects to resist the law; but I am afraid much of this spirit may be\r\ntraced to what has taken place in this house on former occasions. I have\r\nheard persons, charged with the highest employments of government,\r\ninsisting upon the rights of this people to assemble for the expression\r\nof their sentiments, declaiming against any restriction on that right,\r\nand preaching upon this doctrine without restricting it in the manner\r\ndeclared by law--namely, that these assemblies must not be in numbers\r\nsufficient to create alarm. It was but very lately that a great officer\r\nof state, travelling about the country, made a speech to the same\r\npurport at Liverpool, and stated those opinions in the most unreserved\r\nmanner, at the very moment when men were assembling by torch-light\r\nmeetings. We have heard for a number of years past of the extraordinary\r\ntranquillity of Ireland, and as often as I have listened to the phrase,\r\nI have protested against it; but there is a gentleman, high in the\r\nconfidence of government, who goes about devising new modes of agitation\r\nevery day. That gentleman ought to have a special copy of the speech\r\nsent to him! One time he talks of raising 2,000,000 of men--at another\r\ntime of a fund of 20,000 l. sterling, which is deposited in his private\r\nbank, and ultimately to be deposited in his private pocket. In order to\r\nfurther his new schemes of agitation, that gentleman has declared his\r\nintention of raising 60,000 fighting men for her majesty, though he has\r\nnever, that I am aware of, been employed as a recruiting officer.\r\nSometimes these boasts do not turn out to be true; but if not 60,000\r\npersons, there may be 6,000, or some force of that description, which\r\nwould be a serious inconvenience to the government.\r\n\r\n_February 5, 1839._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Folly of carrying on war with a peace establishment._\r\n\r\nThis country is at war--at war in two quarters of the world--at war in\r\nAmerica and at war in Asia; and what I say is this, that when a country\r\nis at war, I understand that the fleet of that country should be put\r\nupon a war establishment; whereas, these returns are made on a peace\r\nestablishment--nay, I believe on one much lower,--on a reduced peace\r\nestablishment; and yet we are pretending to carry on war in two\r\ncountries of the world with such means! I warned your lordships a year\r\nand a half ago--indeed nearly two years ago, against any such attempt. I\r\nbelieve that we have been feeling the inconvenience of such an attempt\r\nfrom that period up to the present time, and I only hope and trust in\r\nGod, that we shall not experience still further inconvenience and\r\ndisasters from our perseverance in it. A peace establishment, and a\r\nreduced peace establishment, may be very fit and very proper for\r\ncarrying on the service of the country in time of peace; but when we\r\ncome to carry on war, our peace establishment is not found equal to the\r\nperformance of the duties required from the establishment in time of\r\npeace, and still less to those extended duties which must be performed\r\nin time of war.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe are carrying on a war in North America, and a most expensive war in\r\nAsia; and both of them require all the force this country can employ in\r\norder to bring them to an early and an honourable termination. We are,\r\nhowever, engaging in both with a reduced peace establishment, and we are\r\nincurring all descriptions of risks, in every other part of the world,\r\nin order to do this. The noble earl (Minto) has been talking about a\r\nfew masts and sails, when the whole force which the country can command\r\nought to be engaged in the war now waging, in order to bring the contest\r\nto the honourable termination I speak of. I said this about a year and a\r\nhalf ago, and I now repeat it.\r\n\r\n_March 7, 1839._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The Corn Laws have improved Agriculture._\r\n\r\nThe system which it is the object of the existing law to establish, is\r\none of encouragement to agriculture--a system which was established at\r\nthe termination of the last century, and under which I will venture to\r\nassert, the agriculture of this country has made a progress, and has\r\nrisen to a degree of superiority throughout these kingdoms, greater than\r\nexists in any other part of the world, not excepting even the\r\nNetherlands. Under this system of encouragement to agriculture, large\r\nsums of money have been laid out and invested in land, and property\r\nrelating to land; and great sums are at this moment in the course of\r\ninvestment in the same way; and I call on your lordships not to agree to\r\nany resolution, or to any measure of the government (if they should\r\nthink proper to propose any such measure), which will have the effect of\r\nwithdrawing from agriculture this protection, and thus putting a stop to\r\nthose great improvements which are at present in progress, and which, I\r\nsay, have had such an influence on agriculture, that the amount of\r\nproduce raised in this country is thereby greatly increased. I believe\r\nthat the produce of the country has been immensely increased, and\r\nparticularly in the valuable article of wheat, the annual production of\r\nwhich is now nearly equal to its greatest annual consumption. Such is\r\nthe supply of wheat that the very lowest order of the people subsist\r\nmostly upon it; which is not, I believe, the practice in any other\r\ncountry. The practice is not known any where else; it is not known in\r\nFrance; it is not known in Germany; it is not known in the Netherlands;\r\nnor is it, in short, the case any where else. In fact, the lower orders\r\nlive upon wheaten bread in no country of the world except England. I\r\nentreat your lordships to bear this in mind; I entreat you not to break\r\ndown a system which has carried cultivation to such a pitch, that an\r\namount of produce is raised in England, alone, which is found to be\r\nnearly equal to her greatest annual consumption. I think the annual\r\namount of produce will increase. This is my firm belief; and I am\r\nconfident that with the increase of produce there must come, and come\r\nnaturally too, a corresponding decrease of price; and it is to that\r\nconsequence that I look as being the solution of all the difficulties\r\nwhich at present attend this question. But, let your lordships\r\nrecollect, it is absolutely necessary to keep up this encouragement in\r\norder to arrive at the desired result of the reduction of price. Very\r\nlately, when wheat in this country was at 78s. the quarter, and the duty\r\non importation was a merely nominal one of 1s. a quarter, was there any\r\nsuch quantity of foreign wheat introduced as was sufficient to lower the\r\nprice? Not at all. The moment the ports were opened, the merchant\r\nimporter stood on the same ground as the farmer, and he would not sell\r\nhis corn for 1s. less than the price of the day. Did we ever hear of\r\ncorn coming in from abroad, and being brought to market at a cheaper\r\nrate than it was selling for in this country? Never. But look to the\r\noperation of the law prevailing in the former part of the war; the\r\nprices varied from 70s. to 150s. the quarter. Did we ever hear of\r\nforeign corn being sold for 1s. less than what could be got for it in\r\nthe general markets of this country? It must be sold by the merchant\r\nimporter at the very same price as by the farmer. It is all very fine to\r\nsay that the price would be exceedingly low, if these laws were\r\nabolished, and corn were allowed to be introduced without restriction.\r\nWhy, if the price of corn raised in this country were low, the foreigner\r\ncould not get more for his corn here, than the farmer; but if the price\r\nof home grown corn were necessarily high, the introduction of foreign\r\ncorn would not reduce it.\r\n\r\n_March 14, 1839._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Repeal of the Corn Laws will raise the price of Corn._\r\n\r\nIt is very important to look at this question with reference to the\r\ninterests of the commerce of the country, and also to consider the\r\neffect of the abolition of the corn laws on the price of provisions and\r\non the price of manufactures. Now, if we discourage agriculture to such\r\na degree that any large body of persons and a great amount of capital\r\ncome to be withdrawn from it, the price of native produce must rise;\r\nthere would be so much less produce raised than before, that its\r\nprice--the price of the native produce I mean--must rise. Now, the price\r\nof the corn imported will be the price of the diminished quantity of the\r\nhome-raised corn. Would the manufacturing labourer benefit by this?\r\nWould the manufacturer find any advantage in it, when the diminished\r\nvalue of their wages was forcing the labourers to raise the market upon\r\nhim? Would the merchant exporter gain anything by the change? Would it\r\nnot be found that, in proportion as the manufacturer must pay a larger\r\namount of wages, the prices of his manufactures must be augmented; and\r\ntherefore the disadvantages of competition with merchants abroad be\r\naugmented likewise?\r\n\r\n_March 14, 1839._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Foreign Governments would Tax the Export of their Corn._\r\n\r\nThere is another view of the question which I beseech your lordships to\r\ntake--I mean the question of our dependence on foreign produce for a\r\ngreat part of our annual consumption, which would be caused by the\r\nabolition of the present law. On looking over the papers which have been\r\nproduced on former discussions of this subject, I have seen proofs that\r\nin certain countries duties are paid upon the exportation of corn thence\r\nhither; and that statements are made by the sovereigns of those\r\ncountries to this effect:--\"As the corn is wanted by Great Britain, and\r\nher subjects can afford to pay the duty, therefore they shall pay it.\"\r\nThis duty must come out of the pocket of her majesty's subjects, and be\r\ntaken into account in the price of the goods of the manufacturers. Your\r\nlordships have heard a great deal upon the competition of foreign\r\nmanufacturers with our own in foreign markets. I certainly am one who\r\ndoes not despise the consideration of these subjects; which, on the\r\ncontrary, I think of very high importance; but this question is a large\r\none, and it is necessary to consider it on rather broader grounds. This\r\nvery consideration may be material with respect to some countries of\r\nwhich we have been the creditors; but I do not see how our relations\r\nwith those which are not corn countries can be affected by any change in\r\nthe corn laws. The power of taxation, which would be thrown into the\r\nhands of foreign powers, in the event of the repeal of the corn laws,\r\nconstitutes, in my view, a most important feature of the case. Suppose\r\nwe were involved in an arduous competition with Prussian or Russian\r\nmanufacturers for the supply of a particular article: if we should make\r\nup our minds to rely solely on those countries for a supply of corn, as\r\nwe are called upon to do by the opponents of the corn laws,--and if the\r\nsuccess of our manufactures depends on the abundance and cheapness of\r\ncorn among our population--must we not expect, according to the usual\r\ncourse of such affairs among mankind, that the corn exported from those\r\ncountries would be taxed so as to render the food of our manufacturers\r\nas dear as it would be under any other circumstances? If that is likely\r\nto be the case, I would strongly advise you, my lords, to agree to no\r\nmeasure which may render this country dependent upon others for its\r\nsupply of food. Let us persevere in those measures which have been\r\nsuccessful in raising the agriculture of this country and increasing its\r\nproduce; let us increase its produce to the utmost possible degree, and\r\nrender all the articles of food as cheap as possible; and then let us\r\nsee what can be done with reference to commerce and its interests; but\r\nlet us, I entreat, begin by securing to her majesty's subjects a supply\r\nof the best food from the produce of her majesty's own dominions.\r\n\r\n_March 14, 1839._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_As a public man, stands on public grounds._\r\n\r\nThe noble earl (Radnor) says that I am an advocate for a monopoly; and\r\nhe talks about my not assisting the landlords, not assisting the\r\nfarmers, and not assisting the labourers. My lords, I know nothing about\r\nlandlords, farmers, or labourers, when I am advocating a legislative\r\nquestion of a public nature in this house. I have nothing to say to them\r\nany farther than as their interests are identified with those of the\r\ncommunity at large. I beg the noble lord to understand, when I come into\r\nthis house, I come here upon the public interest. I have no more to say\r\nto landlords, farmers, or labourers, than the noble earl himself; and I\r\nam thoroughly convinced there is not a noble friend near me who does not\r\nlook at this question solely on public grounds, and those which he\r\nconceives it to be for the interest of the country to take.\r\n\r\n_March 14, 1839._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Objections to a free press in Malta._\r\n\r\nI am one of those who have always thought, that if there existed any\r\npart of her majesty's dominions in which a free press was not necessary,\r\nMalta was that part. Our business there is to maintain a garrison and a\r\ngreat naval station. Malta contains a population of 100,000 persons, for\r\nwhom I entertain the highest respect and regard, being convinced that\r\nher majesty has no better or more devoted subjects than they are. It is\r\nthe duty of government, and the duty of this house, as far as it can, to\r\nsuperintend the good government of the people of Malta--a people who\r\ntalk the Maltese language, and the Maltese language alone--a people, of\r\nwhom not one in 500 can read a line. Surely, of all the institutions of\r\nthis country which are the least necessary for men of this description,\r\nand I declare my belief that it is a true description of the people of\r\nMalta, I may venture to assert a free press is that one institution. I\r\nwill not dispute that hereafter much good may arise from a free press,\r\nbut education is much more necessary for the people of Malta. A free\r\npress cannot be rendered useful to them, much less advantageous, without\r\nthat training which they require, and that education which ought to be\r\ngiven to them. There is a certain liberal set of gentlemen in this\r\ncountry who think a free press in Malta exceedingly desirable, not for\r\nthe sake of any advantage to the inhabitants, but for the sake of the\r\nadvantage to be produced on the neighbouring coast of France, and Spain,\r\nand Italy. This is the truth with respect to this free press. * * I\r\nbelieve that we have now had enough of private wars, and I believe that\r\nwe now seek what advantage it would have been, if we had never\r\nundertaken those private wars, not only in other parts of the world, but\r\nalso a little nearer home. I must say that the objects of them are\r\ninconsistent with the interests--aye, and inconsistent with the\r\nhonour--of this country; inconsistent with the interests of the country,\r\nbecause, as I always have maintained, and always shall maintain, the\r\ninterests of this country must depend, not only on the maintenance of\r\npeace for itself, but on its preventing, if possible, disturbances among\r\nother nations; and inconsistent with its honour, because I will say,\r\nthat its honour does depend on not exciting rebellions and insurrections\r\nin other nations, at the same moment that the government here is\r\nostensibly at peace with those nations. Now, that is the ground on which\r\nI have always objected to a free press in Malta. I object to it, because\r\nI contend that the intention entertained is to have a free press, not\r\nfor Malta, but for the neighbouring regions of Italy, France, and Spain;\r\nand if you must have a free press for the Maltese, in the name of God\r\nlet it be in the Maltese language!\r\n\r\n_April 30, 1839._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Malta. Its riches and resources._\r\n\r\nI have reason to know something of Malta; I know something of its\r\nresources; and, instead of its being misgoverned, I can only say that in\r\nthe course of my intercourse with that island, I was astonished at the\r\nimmensity of its resources of all descriptions, and at the readiness\r\nwith which these resources were afforded to his majesty's troops and\r\narmies, in order to enable them to carry on war against an enemy. It is\r\nbut an act of justice to those noble and honourable persons who have\r\ngoverned Malta, to say thus much; and I must add that, having known that\r\nisland for a period of nearly twenty years, I really believe that, on\r\nthe face of the globe there is not a place of the same extent and\r\npopulation which possesses one thousandth part of its riches and\r\nresources of all descriptions.\r\n\r\n_April 30, 1839._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Indifference to Reports._\r\n\r\nI have served the sovereigns and the public of this country for fifty\r\nyears, and throughout the whole of that period I have been exposed to\r\nevil report and to good report, and I have still continued to serve on\r\nthrough all report, both good and evil, and thus I confess myself to be\r\ncompletely indifferent to the nature of all reports.\r\n\r\n_May 14, 1839._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Personal Attendants of the Sovereign. Their Political Influence._\r\n\r\nWhen the noble viscount announced in this house on Tuesday last that he\r\nhad resigned his office, the probable consequences of that announcement\r\noccurred to my mind, and I turned my attention in consequence to the\r\nstate of the government at the present moment--to the state of the royal\r\nauthority--to the composition of the royal household--and to all those\r\ncircumstances which were likely to come under my consideration, in case\r\nI were called upon to assist in advising the composition of another\r\nadministration. I confess, that it appeared to me impossible that any\r\nset of men should take charge of her majesty's government without having\r\nthe usual influence and control over the establishment of the royal\r\nhousehold--that influence and control which their immediate predecessors\r\nin office had exercised before them. As the royal household was formed\r\nby their predecessors in office, the possession of that influence and\r\nthat control over it appeared to me to be absolutely necessary, to let\r\nthe public see that the ministers who were about to enter upon office\r\nhad and possessed the entire confidence of her majesty. I considered\r\nwell the nature of the formation of the royal household under the civil\r\nlist act passed at the commencement of her majesty's reign. I considered\r\nwell the difference between the household of a queen-consort and the\r\nhousehold of a queen-regnant. The queen-consort not being a political\r\nperson in the same light as a queen-regnant, I considered the\r\nconstruction of her majesty's household--I considered who filled offices\r\nin it--I considered all the circumstances attendant on the influence of\r\nthe household, and the degree of confidence which it might be necessary\r\nfor the government to repose in the members of it. I was sensible of the\r\nserious and anxious nature of the charge which the minister in\r\npossession of that control and influence over her majesty's household\r\nwould have laid upon him. I was sensible that in everything which he\r\ndid, and in every step which he took as to the household, he ought to\r\nconsult not only the honour of her majesty's crown, and her royal state\r\nand dignity, but also her social condition, her ease, her convenience,\r\nher comfort--in short, everything which tended to the solace and\r\nhappiness of her life. I reflected on all these considerations as\r\nparticularly incumbent on the ministers who should take charge of the\r\naffairs of this country; I reflected on the age, the sex, the situation,\r\nand the comparative inexperience, of the sovereign on the throne; and I\r\nmust say that if I had been, or if I was to be, the first person to be\r\nconsulted, with respect to the exercise of the influence and control in\r\nquestion, I would suffer any inconvenience whatever, rather than take\r\nany step as to the royal household which was not compatible with her\r\nmajesty's comforts.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI cannot but think that the principles on which we proposed to act with\r\nrespect to the ladies of the bed-chamber, in the case of a\r\nqueen-regnant, were the correct principles. The public will not believe\r\nthat the queen holds no political conversation with those ladies, and\r\nthat political influence is not exercised by them, particularly\r\nconsidering who those persons are who hold such situations. I believe\r\nthe history of this country affords a number of instances in which\r\nsecret and improper influence has been exercised by means of such\r\nconversations. I have, my lords, a somewhat strong opinion on this\r\nsubject. I have unworthily filled the office which the noble viscount\r\nnow so worthily holds; and I must say I have felt the inconvenience of\r\nan anomalous influence, not exercised, perhaps, by ladies, but anomalous\r\ninfluence, undoubtedly, of this description, and exerted simply in\r\nconversations; and I will tell the noble viscount that the country is at\r\nthis moment suffering some inconvenience from the exercise of that very\r\nsecret influence.\r\n\r\n_May 14, 1839._\r\n\r\nA war carried on by militia, volunteers, and troops of that description,\r\nwill infallibly be carried on after the manner of civil wars.\r\n\r\nMay 30, 1839.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Reasons for passing the Poor Law._\r\n\r\nI have been long enough in parliament to recollect that, before the\r\npresent law passed, there were not less than half-a-dozen attempts made,\r\nby some of the greatest men this country ever produced, to amend the\r\nsystem of the poor laws. Among others, the late Mr. Pitt endeavoured to\r\namend these laws, but failed, and for a reason which I believe\r\noccasioned the failure of every attempt to alter them until that which\r\nwas successfully made within these five years, when the present poor law\r\namendment act was passed, principally by the exertions of the noble and\r\nlearned lord (Lord Brougham). The real truth of the matter was\r\nthis--that in every parish in the country there existed some abuses, I\r\nwill venture to say a hundred times greater than any of those with which\r\nthe noble earl (Stanhope) entertains your lordships upon every vacant\r\nday that presents itself. In every parish, I repeat, there were abuses;\r\nand, in each, abuses founded upon a different principle from those\r\nexisting in some neighbouring parish; so that no law could be devised to\r\nremedy them; for the measure which would apply to parish A, instead of\r\nremoving the abuses existing in parish B, would only have tended to\r\naggravate and render them intolerable. At length, there was a very\r\ngeneral and searching inquiry into the whole state of the administration\r\nof the poor laws; the result of which was, that the present measure was\r\narranged and produced to parliament. It passed both houses in a very\r\nshort space of time, and, I believe, on the principle there was no\r\ndivision whatever, and hardly a difference of opinion, in this house; I\r\nbelieve there was none in the other house of parliament, and very little\r\ndifference of opinion was expressed upon any part of the details. With\r\nrespect to the administration of the law, I have observed it in\r\ndifferent parts of the country, and I must say that its administration\r\nhas been entirely satisfactory, and most particularly to those parties\r\nwho are likely to become its more immediate objects. That part of the\r\nlaw of which the noble earl complains most, namely, the existence of the\r\npoor law commissioners, is, in my opinion, the most important part of\r\nit. The truth of the matter is, that the abuses in the administration of\r\nthe poor laws were so numerous, so various, and, at the same time, so\r\ninveterate, that it was absolutely impossible to get the better of them,\r\nwithout the constitution of some central authority which should\r\nsuperintend the execution of the law; taking care that it was duly\r\nadministered, and that those intrusted with its execution in the country\r\ndid not infringe upon its provisions. Such, I believe, was the object of\r\nthe institution of those boards of guardians and commissioners.\r\n\r\n_June 18, 1839._\r\n\r\n_The Ballot and Universal Suffrage dangerous. Open questions a symptom\r\nof weakness in a Government._\r\n\r\nI fully concur with the noble viscount (Melbourne) in the propriety of\r\nopposing the further extension of the suffrage, and upon the very same\r\nground, namely, that such extension would be inconsistent with the best\r\ninterests of the country. I likewise concur in the sentiments which that\r\nnoble viscount has expressed upon the subject of the ballot; that\r\nobnoxious, and, I must say, un-English measure; at the same time I\r\ndeeply regret that the noble viscount did think proper to make it what\r\nis called an open question. I had the misfortune to be in office when\r\nthere were such questions, and I must say, that I never could consider\r\nthem as anything but a symptom of weakness on the part of those who were\r\ncarrying on the service of their sovereign--a symptom that they were not\r\nacting together, that they did not agree amongst themselves, and that\r\nthere was a division also amongst their supporters. Instead of its being\r\na matter of satisfaction that an individual question like the ballot\r\nshould be left an open question, I regard it as a circumstance most\r\nlikely to prove disastrous to the government, and eventually so to the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nJune 25, 1839.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The Birmingham Riots in 1839. The town treated worse than if taken by\r\nstorm._\r\n\r\nI have been accused of \"exaggeration.\"[21] That may be a parliamentary\r\nphrase; I will not presume to decide that it is an unparliamentary\r\nterm; but I believe that it is a term not much used amongst gentlemen.\r\nIt has been employed, however, in a privileged place, that must be\r\nnameless, and I shall advert to it no farther than to notice the\r\nconclusions which may be drawn from the use of such a term in reference\r\nto what I did say. I trust your lordships will excuse me for a few\r\nmoments upon this subject, because I really think I have been most\r\nunjustifiably made the subject of a personal attack for what I stated in\r\nthis, your lordships' house, with respect to the late riots in\r\nBirmingham. What I stated, my lords, was founded on the same species of\r\ninformation which, it appears, was in the possession of her majesty's\r\ngovernment; for, neither the noble viscount, nor any of the other noble\r\nlords opposite, knew any more of the subject than I did; they knew\r\nnothing beyond what they had seen in the newspapers; and I stated, at\r\nthe time, that I knew nothing beyond that, myself, with regard to the\r\nfacts. But I compared the transactions at Birmingham with certain other\r\ntransactions, of which, certainly, I have more knowledge than most noble\r\nlords in this house; matters on which I had a certain and positive\r\nknowledge; and I said (and I firmly believe that it was correct, and\r\nthat, in making the comparison I did not, in the least degree, depart\r\nfrom the truth), that the peaceable inhabitants of the town of\r\nBirmingham were worse treated, upon that occasion, than the inhabitants\r\nof any town I had ever known or seen taken by assault. This is what I\r\nasserted; and, it is the fact, according to my opinion.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: A member of the House of Commons had used this term as\r\napplied to the Duke's remarks on this subject, a few nights previously.]\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nI cannot help thinking that it is extraordinary that, in the year 1839,\r\nafter nine years of liberal government,--after nine years' enjoyment of\r\nthe blessings of liberal government,--your lordships should be\r\ndiscussing whether or not the amount of destruction completed within a\r\npeaceful town within her majesty's dominions is equal to the mischief\r\ndone to a town which is taken by storm. And yet this has been clearly\r\ndemonstrated to be the case. It is clear, my lords, that in peaceful,\r\nhappy England, which carried on a war for twenty-two years, and which\r\nmade the most extraordinary efforts to maintain that war, as she did,\r\nwith circumstances of glory and success attending her arms in all parts\r\nof the world,--in order to avoid as it was hoped, these miseries, and so\r\nthat no such disasters as these might ever approach her shores,--in this\r\nsame happy and peaceful England, after nine years of liberal government,\r\nhere is a town plundered, and its peace destroyed; and yet I am accused\r\nof exaggeration, because I say I never knew any town, taken by storm, to\r\nbe so ill-used as this fine town has been. I confess I am not at all\r\nsurprised, however, at the conduct of the noble lord who so liberally\r\napplied the term \"exaggeration\" to what I said, when I reflect who are\r\nthe followers and supporters of that noble lord.\r\n\r\n_July 22, 1839._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Legal redress against Magistrates._\r\n\r\nI apprehend that, according to the law of England, any individual is at\r\nliberty to complain of the conduct of a magistrate, and proceed against\r\nhim in a court of law. No one has ever doubted that, in this country,\r\nevery individual has a right so to complain of, and to proceed against,\r\nthe magistrates, when the magistrates misconduct themselves. It is in\r\naccordance only with the _Code Napoléon_,--with the code of laws of that\r\nhigh priest of liberalism, the Emperor Napoleon,--that the consent of\r\nthe council of state should be given, before a justice misconducting\r\nhimself can be tried and punished. Hitherto, in this country, the\r\npractice and the law have been different on that head; and I hope we\r\nshall hear no more of such proceedings. But follow out the system laid\r\ndown in the letter from the Home Office, and the result will be that no\r\nman--- particularly if he have to complain of the conduct of a\r\nmagistrate--will, without the consent of the home secretary, go into a\r\ncourt of justice to obtain redress. My lords, to such a course I trust I\r\nshall see some check put, before it is further established by\r\nprecedents.\r\n\r\nJuly 22,1839.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Reasons for Supporting the Penny Postage Bill_.\r\n\r\nIn the preamble of this bill, it is stated to have for its object the\r\nestablishment, in this country, of a low and uniform rate of postage. I\r\nadmit the truth of the arguments stated by the noble viscount upon the\r\nexpediency, and, indeed, the necessity, of establishing an uniform and\r\nlow rate of postage in this country. These arguments have been urged\r\nmore than once by my noble friend near me (Lord Ashburton), and by the\r\nnoble duke who heretofore filled the office of postmaster general, but\r\nwhom I do not see in his place this evening. If, however, the object be\r\nonly to reduce the expense of postage, and to establish an uniform rate,\r\nI imagine that the power of the government is already sufficient for\r\nsuch a purpose, although the power was not granted for that immediate\r\nobject; but the object with which the power was given was, for the\r\npurpose of enabling the government to adopt that particular plan which\r\nis called Mr. Rowland Hill's plan, and which, I am certainly disposed to\r\nadmit, was, of all plans, if adopted exactly as Mr. Hill proposed it,\r\nthe most likely to be successful. At the same time, I must say, I am\r\nafraid the present plan will not be entirely successful. I think, in the\r\nfirst place, that a great mistake is committed, in the assumption that\r\nthe reduction in the rate of postage down to a penny, even to be paid on\r\nthe delivery of the letter, would induce any very considerable increase\r\nof literary correspondence. I possessed, for many years, an extensive\r\nknowledge of the degree of advantage attendant upon such a system in the\r\narmy; and I can safely assert to your lordships, that it is quite\r\ncurious to remark how small an amount of correspondence is carried on by\r\nsoldiers, notwithstanding they enjoy the utmost facility for doing so.\r\nOne remarkable instance I will mention, just to show that it is not\r\nquite certain that a large increase of correspondence will take place in\r\nconsequence of the rate of postage being reduced to a penny. In the case\r\nof a highland regiment, it was positively ascertained that, in the\r\ncourse of six or seven months, only sixty-three or sixty-four letters\r\nwere written. Now this is a fact on which reliance can be placed; and it\r\ncertainly demonstrates that the people of this country are not so ready\r\nto correspond, as some suppose, even when they can send letters at the\r\nrate of a penny for the postage. I would beg your lordships to observe\r\njust one point touching the application of this plan to the country\r\nparts of England. It is perfectly well known to you that the post-office\r\nis frequently six or seven miles, and sometimes ten or fifteen miles,\r\nfrom most of the houses and villages in the neighbourhood. Now, if a man\r\nhave to take a letter to the post-office, he may lose half a day's work\r\nin going there; and it cannot be supposed that he would make such a\r\nsacrifice merely because he would only be charged a penny on the\r\ndelivery of his letter. Then, again, let us look at the manner in which\r\nthe plan will work in large towns. The plan will, no doubt, work\r\nbeneficially in London. In London, there are a number of people employed\r\nfor the purpose of delivering letters in all parts of the town several\r\ntimes in the course of the day. But let us take such towns as\r\nManchester, or Leeds, or Liverpool; the people cannot resort to one\r\npost-office, and post-offices must therefore be established in different\r\nparts of the town for their accommodation; and the consequence will be,\r\na vast increase in the establishment of the post-office,--of which\r\nincrease, I do not think sufficient notice has been taken in the\r\ndocuments which I have perused. Upon the whole, then, I am very much\r\nafraid that this scheme for a low and uniform rate of postage wilt be\r\nfound impracticable on account of the expense, and, also, from the small\r\namount of profit which will accrue from the carriage of the letters.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt the time this subject was first mentioned in this house, and, indeed,\r\nin the other house of parliament, the noble viscount said that his main\r\nobject would he to secure the revenue; and I certainly apprehended that\r\nthe noble viscount would not adopt this plan, unless he could see some\r\nsecurity for the revenue; and this was the language held, also, in the\r\nother house of parliament, I understand. It seems now, however, that we\r\nhave got no security for the revenue.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut my lords, notwithstanding I feel so little confidence in this\r\nmeasure, and notwithstanding that I must continue to lament that it\r\nshould ever have been adopted, when all the circumstances of the present\r\ntimes are considered,--I, nevertheless, earnestly recommend you to pass\r\nit. It is a measure which has been most anxiously looked forward to by\r\nthe country; at the same time that it is one as to which there has been\r\nmuch doubt: but your lordships should bear in mind, that there is not\r\none clause of this bill upon which you can make an amendment, or in\r\nwhich you can give a vote, except in the negative or the affirmative,\r\nwithout committing a breach of those conventional rules which have been\r\nestablished for the conduct of the business between you and the House of\r\nCommons. On the other hand, my lords, suppose you were to reject this\r\nbill;--the government, supported by the other house, would have the\r\npower to destroy the whole revenue of the post-office; so that all the\r\nevil which this bill could do to the revenue, and which it is your\r\nobject to save, might still be done;--and seeing that, at the same time,\r\nthe measure of post-office administration, which it is the object of\r\nthis bill to effect, and which it is desired should be carried into\r\nexecution, must altogether lie over, unless you agree to some such\r\nmeasure as this;--I say, my lords, under these circumstances, I intend,\r\nthough with pain and reluctance, to vote for the bill; and I earnestly\r\nrecommend your lordships to adopt it.\r\n\r\n_August 5, 1839._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Danger of interfering with the Religion of the Hindoos._\r\n\r\nMy lords, I served in India for a considerable length of time; but I\r\nnever saw--I never heard of--anything so revolting in the religious\r\nceremonies of the natives as has been described by the noble duke and by\r\nthe right reverend prelate. The whole army, while I was in India, except\r\nabout 50,000 men, consisted of idolaters; but they were as good soldiers\r\nas could be found anywhere. They performed, in the best manner, any\r\nservice that was required of them; and certainly, at that time, the\r\nobject of the government, and of every man in the service of the\r\ngovernment, was to avoid, not only interference, but even the semblance\r\nof any interference, in any manner, in the idolatrous rites and\r\nceremonies of the country. I have not read one of the dispatches which\r\nhave been alluded to; and I must say that I have seen too much, in my\r\nown experience, to encourage the practice of encouraging documents of\r\nthis description. I beg your lordships to recollect, that with the\r\nexception of about 20,000 of her majesty's troops, and, with the\r\nexception of the civil servants of the government, and the few European\r\nresidents in the country, there is not a man in India who is not an\r\nidolater, to manage the affairs of that most extensive and important\r\nempire. I would entreat your lordships never to lose sight of that fact.\r\nI know, too, from experience, for I have seen the missionaries at work,\r\nthe little progress which they make; and I know at the same time that\r\ntheir labours create a good deal of jealousy. I warn the government not\r\nto go too far in their measures against the idolatry of India; for the\r\nIndian empire is one of great importance, and they must not expect to\r\nconvert 100,000,000 of idolaters to our holy religion by the small means\r\nat their disposal.\r\n\r\n_August 13, 1839._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Never said one thing and meant another._\r\n\r\nI will not make any professions of my own anxiety to put down the slave\r\ntrade. I have passed a long life, I trust with honour, in the service of\r\nher majesty's predecessors. I served her majesty's predecessors in\r\ndiplomatic situations and in councils, as well as in the army, and I\r\nbelieve people cannot accuse me of saying one thing and meaning another.\r\n\r\n_August 19, 1839._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Impotent Colonial Administration of the Whigs._\r\n\r\nWe have sacrificed 20,000,000 l. of money to terminate slavery in the\r\nBritish colonies; and we are now calling upon other nations--upon the\r\nUnited States, upon Spain, upon the Brazils, and upon various powers\r\nwhich possess slaves--to imitate and to follow our example; but what\r\nhave we done to secure the co-operation of those great countries in the\r\ngreat object that we have in view? We have offered no inducement to\r\nthose nations to imitate our example, by the establishment of order and\r\ngood government in our West Indian colonies; for nowhere have we\r\nproperly or adequately availed ourselves of those advantages which we\r\nhave, or of those advantages which we might procure, to give security to\r\nlife and property in those islands, and to maintain peace and\r\ntranquillity among their inhabitants. The communities in the West Indies\r\nare all small societies; and there is not a man in any one of them, not\r\nin Jamaica, even, which is the largest of them, who is not within the\r\nreach of authority. The government of each of those islands is strong in\r\nthe means of exercising authority--strong in garrisons, strong in\r\ntroops, strong in a police force, and in everything necessary for the\r\npreservation of life and property, for carrying the laws into execution,\r\nand for affording security to every individual, even to the very lowest\r\nof the people;--but yet, I will venture to say, since the enactment of\r\nthe law for the emancipation of the slaves, there have been and are no\r\nsocieties, in the whole world, in such a state of disorganization,\r\ndisorder, and anarchy, as are those very West Indian islands of ours;\r\nbut which, if they were well managed and governed by the noble lord,\r\nnominally at the head of the colonial department, instead of by the\r\ndifferent factions that resort thither to interfere with the business of\r\nthat government, ought, and are calculated, to be of the greatest\r\nadvantage to this nation. There are no societies in the world more\r\ncapable of being well governed, than those islands are, if the noble\r\nlord opposite would only perform his duty in an independent manner, and\r\nkeep all factions at a distance, instead of allowing every faction in\r\nthis country to interfere, on all occasions, with the business of the\r\ngovernment in relation to those colonies. But this is not all; let your\r\nlordships look round in all directions, and you will see the same\r\nlamentable state of things existing. Look at Lower Canada, look at Upper\r\nCanada, at Newfoundland--look where you will, you will see nothing but\r\ndisorder and anarchy--and resulting from what? from nothing but the\r\ninterference of factions in England; who, let your lordships recollect,\r\nhave nothing to do with those colonies. These disorders result solely\r\nfrom the interference of those factions in the affairs of each of those\r\ncolonies; and till the government shall put an end to such interference,\r\nand act altogether independently of it, it is impossible to hope for a\r\nrestoration of tranquillity.\r\n\r\n_August 23, 1839._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The Melbourne Administration no Government._\r\n\r\nI can assure the noble viscount, (Palmerston) that all I desire--and all\r\nI have desired for some years past--is this,--to see a \"government\" in\r\nthe country. To see the country \"governed.\" I wish that I could say\r\nthat I had seen it \"governed\" for some years past; and I hope that the\r\nnoble viscount will now turn over a new leaf, and \"govern\" the country a\r\nlittle better than he has done heretofore. I may tell the noble\r\nviscount, that I have had some little experience in these matters\r\nmyself; and I humbly suggest to the noble viscount, that, before he\r\nannounces measures to parliament through the speech from the throne, in\r\nfuture, he should first take care that those measures have already been\r\nproperly considered; and that, before he inserts them in her majesty's\r\nspeech, he should have them ready prepared, or in such a state of\r\npreparation as to be able to introduce them to parliament immediately\r\nafter the speech from the throne. If he do thus, the measures in all\r\nprobability, will be in such a state that they may be passed, or, at all\r\nevents, they will not be scrambled for among partisans and factions in\r\nparliament: they will then, most likely, be considered by men who, I\r\nconsider, from their official station, must be capable of deciding upon\r\nthem; they will be their measures, and not the measures of factions and\r\nparties; or, at least, they will not be measures presented to parliament\r\nin such a state as that they ought not to pass. But I have desired to\r\nsee a \"government\" in the country, for many other reasons besides those\r\nwhich are referable to the state and manner in which measures have been\r\nbrought forward, after having been announced to parliament in the speech\r\nfrom the throne. I desire to have a \"government\" in this country,\r\nbecause I am anxious to see our colonies settled and governed--because\r\nI wish to see the interior of the country settled and governed as it\r\nought to be governed--and because I wish to see all our establishments\r\nfixed and protected in that form and state in which they are to remain.\r\n\r\n_August 23, 1839._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Causes of the Weakness of the Melbourne Administration._\r\n\r\nThe noble viscount has been pleased to attribute the disturbances in the\r\ncountry, at the present moment, to the opposition which, he says, has\r\nbeen given by your lordships to the measures brought forward for the\r\nredress of grievances. Now I did not like to interrupt the noble\r\nviscount, when he was addressing your lordships; but I certainly felt\r\nmuch disposed to call upon the noble viscount to name what the measures\r\nwere, to which he so alluded. I have been trying, ever since the noble\r\nviscount spoke, to recollect what those measures could be; and I declare\r\nthat, with respect to England, particularly, I do not know of a single\r\nmeasure which has been discussed in this house, and rejected by your\r\nlordships, that would with any degree of propriety, be called a measure\r\nfor the redress of the grievances of the people. If there be such\r\nmeasures, let the noble viscount bring them forward again next session,\r\nand I am sure they will receive from your lordships every attention.\r\nBut, my lords, I have taken another view of the cause of the\r\ndisturbances which now exist in the country. I think they have arisen\r\nfrom a very peculiar state of circumstances; and I will venture to\r\nsubmit them to the noble viscount, in answer to that part of his speech,\r\nin which he was kind enough to attribute those disturbances to the House\r\nof Lords. I believe that they have originated in the unnoticed and\r\nunpunished combinations which have been allowed by the government during\r\nso many years, to exist,--whether as political unions or as trade\r\nunions, or as other combinations,--clearly illegal combinations,--amongst\r\nworkmen, to force others to abandon their work, by those who work at\r\nprices different from those at which they are content to be employed, and\r\nat which they have agreed to work for their employers. These combinations\r\nhave gone so far in some parts of the country,--and more particularly in\r\nthe north of England, and, indeed, throughout almost the whole of the\r\nnorthern part of the island,--as to threaten destruction to the trade and\r\ncredit of the manufacturers; and at last they have arrived at that pitch,\r\nand have spread to that extent, that the country is brought to the\r\nsituation in which we see it at the present moment. For, after all,\r\nwhat are these Chartists, that are found marching about the country,\r\nand engaged in the disturbances that prevail? I have inquired a great\r\ndeal into the subject, and the result is, that I believe they are nothing\r\nmore nor less than persons combined together for the purpose of driving\r\nother workmen--engaged, whether in manufactures, in the collieries, or\r\nagricultural pursuits, or in other districts--from their work; and for\r\nthe purpose of destroying the machinery, and the buildings, and of\r\ninterfering with the capital of the employers,--thus striking at the\r\nvery root of employment, and at the chief means of the sustenance of the\r\npeople,--striking at the foundation of the manufactures and the commerce\r\nof the country, and of all its prosperity. This is my sincere belief; and\r\nall this, I say, is owing to the want of early notice of the proceedings\r\nof those combinations by the government,--to their not having carried the\r\nlaws into execution,--to their having left free from punishment those who\r\nhave been submitted to trial,--and to their unfortunate selection of\r\nmagistrates, and, above all, of the magistrates of the new reformed\r\ncorporations of Birmingham, Manchester, Bolton, and other towns. The\r\ngovernment may rely on it, that, until they adopt different measures,\r\nthey will not induce parliament to look with favour on their\r\nproceedings. The government first reduced all the military\r\nestablishments. Those military establishments are not, even now, nearly\r\nup to their proper footing; and I am firmly convinced that, in the\r\ndisturbed districts, there is not one half the establishment equal to\r\nthe ordinary establishment maintained in time of peace. This\r\ncircumstance, and the want of a due execution of the law upon those who\r\nare tried, convicted, and sentenced to punishment,--and also the fact,\r\nthat those who have been appointed to carry into execution the law are\r\npersons connected by habit, by association, and even by excitement, with\r\nthose very Chartists who have violated the law,--suggest the true causes\r\nof these disturbances; and not the nameless grievances created by a\r\nnameless opposition in this house, to nameless measures, as alleged by\r\nthe noble viscount.\r\n\r\n_August 23, 1839._\r\n\r\n_Speech on Her Majesty's Marriage._\r\n\r\nThere is no noble lord in this house who concurs more sincerely than I\r\ndo in the expression of congratulation to her majesty upon her\r\napproaching marriage, which she has been pleased to announce a second\r\ntime to the public from the throne this day. I sincerely wish, with the\r\nnoble mover and seconder of the address, that this event may tend to the\r\nhappiness and comfort of the Queen. Upon this occasion I should have\r\nbeen contented with the address, and should have offered not another\r\nword, if your lordships had not been called upon in the speech from the\r\nthrone, to concur with the other house of parliament, in making a\r\nsuitable provision for the prince, for whose future station in this\r\ncountry her majesty's speech has prepared us. But, my lords, it appears\r\nto me that when this house is called upon to express an opinion upon a\r\ndetail of this description, the house ought to look into, and act upon,\r\nthis subject--it ought not to be a mere congratulation. I conceive that\r\nthe public have a right to know something beyond the mere name of the\r\nprince whom her majesty is about to espouse. My lords, I had the honour\r\nof being summoned to attend her majesty in privy council, when her\r\nmajesty in council was graciously pleased to declare her intention of\r\nbecoming the espoused of this prince. I observed, that the precedent of\r\nthe reign of George III. was followed in all respects except one, and\r\nthat was the declaration, that this prince was a protestant. [Loud\r\ncries of \"Hear, hear!\" from the opposition benches.] My lords, I, for\r\none, entertain no doubt that the prince is a protestant. I believe he is\r\na protestant. I know he is of a protestant family. I have the honour of\r\nbeing known to some members of that family, and I am sure that it is a\r\nprotestant family. But, my lords, this is a protestant state, and it is\r\nabsolutely necessary, by law, that the person who shall become the\r\nspouse of the queen be a protestant; and, if the precedent of George\r\nIII. has been taken in part, it ought to have been followed throughout;\r\nand then the public would have had the satisfaction of knowing that the\r\nfact of the prince being a protestant, had been officially declared by\r\nher majesty's government. My lords, I know the noble lords opposite too\r\nwell to suppose that they are not aware of the anxiety in the public\r\nmind on this subject; and I know, also, that they had it in their power\r\nto relieve that anxiety, and to gratify the public by making this\r\ndeclaration; nay, more, my lords, I am convinced that there exists the\r\nsame anxiety in the royal mind, about the protestant character of the\r\nstate as is felt by me or any of your lordships. And if so, my lords, I\r\nask, why was the precedent of George III. departed from? Is there any\r\ndoubt as to the religious sentiments of this prince? None at all; there\r\ncan be no doubt that he is a protestant; he cannot be otherwise. Then,\r\nwhy is it not so stated? We have heard something of this marriage from\r\nanother part of the country; we have seen some proceedings on this\r\nsubject since the declaration in council, which show pretty clearly why\r\nthe word \"protestant\" was omitted. My lords, I confess that I am one of\r\nthose who read with great attention all that passes in Ireland;--all\r\nthose speeches which come from that quarter;--and I do it for this\r\nreason: I have been accustomed to that kind of revolutionary\r\ndiscussions. It has been said by an eminent French writer, _en plein\r\njour, on ne conspire pas_; but that is not so now. The object proposed\r\nis terror. These things are declared openly. This I can see from what\r\nappears in the public prints, as I read these public letters and\r\nmissives in order to see what the real danger is, and that I may not be\r\ntaken by surprise. Now, what I mean to say is this,--that I see in what\r\nhas passed elsewhere, a very suspicious reason why the word \"protestant\"\r\nwas not inserted in the communication made to the privy council, and why\r\nit has not been inserted in the speech from the throne. I say to the\r\nnoble lords opposite, that I believe they are as much determined as I\r\nam, myself, to maintain the protestant ascendancy of the state. I think,\r\nthen, if this be the case, that upon the first occasion, when this\r\nquestion comes before your lordships, and when the House of Lords shall\r\nbe called upon to do any act, or to make any declaration upon the\r\nsubject, beyond the mere congratulation of the queen, your lordships\r\nshould take that course which may procure the country the satisfaction\r\nof knowing that Prince Albert is a protestant prince, and that this is\r\nstill a protestant state.\r\n\r\n_January 16, 1840._\r\n\r\n_Approbation of the Conduct of the Affghanistan Expedition._\r\n\r\nMy lords, having been, for a great part of my life, selected to carry\r\ninto execution, under superior authority, measures of this description,\r\nno man can be more capable of judging, from experience, of the merits of\r\ngovernment in planning and carrying into operation such measures; and I\r\nshould be the last man to doubt, at any time, the expediency of this or\r\nthe other house expressing its approbation of the conduct of the\r\npolitical servants of the crown in planning and working out all\r\narrangements preparatory to carrying into execution great military\r\noperations. My lords, it has happened to me, by accident, that I had\r\nsome knowledge of the arrangements made for the execution of this great\r\nmilitary enterprise; and, I must say, that I have never known an\r\noccasion on which the duty of a government was performed on a larger\r\nscale,--on which a more adequate provision was made for all\r\ncontingencies that could occur, and for all the various events which\r\ncould, and which did, in fact, occur during this campaign. My lords, it\r\nwould be presumptuous in me to say more on this subject, having, I\r\nrepeat, been made acquainted, only by accident, with the arrangements\r\nmade preparatory to the campaign now brought under your lordships'\r\nattention. With respect to the military services performed, I can say\r\nnothing beyond, nor more deserving the officers and troops, than what\r\nhas been stated by the governor-general in his dispatch. My lords, I am\r\nwell acquainted with the officers who have directed and performed these\r\nservices; and I must say that there are no men in the service who\r\ndeserve a higher degree of approbation for the manner in which, on all\r\noccasions, they have discharged their duty; and that, in no instance\r\nthat I have ever heard of, have such services been performed in a manner\r\nbetter calculated to deserve and secure the approbation of your\r\nlordships and of the country.\r\n\r\n_February 4, 1840._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Danger of Socialism._\r\n\r\nIt appears that this system (Socialism) has spread itself over a great\r\npart of the country; and, upon inquiry, I find that it has taken root\r\nrather extensively in the county in which I reside. I find that in\r\nHampshire, or on the borders of the two counties, Wiltshire and\r\nHampshire, there is a large institution for the propagation of Socialist\r\nprinciples, spreading over no less than five hundred acres of land,\r\nwhich this society have purchased for their purposes. In reference to\r\nthat institution, I have this day presented a petition to your\r\nlordships, containing statements as to the doctrines of this society,\r\nregarding religion, the holy scriptures, God Almighty, and all the great\r\npoints of our belief; which statements, in my estimation, demand the\r\nmost serious inquiry. When I read that petition, which I did the moment\r\nit was placed in my hands, I felt it to be my duty, as the lord\r\nlieutenant of the county, to call the attention of the magistracy to\r\nthe facts which it set forth. That I considered to be my duty; and I\r\nsay, also, that the House of Lords, now that the facts have been brought\r\nbefore them, have a duty to perform to the country, on this question.\r\nThese doctrines of Socialism are rapidly gaining strength--are spreading\r\nthemselves throughout the country. They have now got beyond that point\r\nat which your lordships might say, \"We will take no steps in the matter;\r\nthe system is absurd, and will fall to pieces of itself.\" I say, my\r\nlords, we have got beyond that point; and the people should be made to\r\nunderstand that the legislature and the government look on those\r\ninstitutions only with disfavour, and are determined to discountenance\r\nthem. And they should also be made to know, that wherever, in the\r\npromulgation of the doctrines of this society, there shall be a breach\r\nof the law committed, it will be treated as such, and punished as such.\r\nI say, then, that it is incumbent on your lordships to take such steps\r\nas will satisfy the country that your attention has been directed to the\r\nsubject, with the view to remove the evil and ensure tranquillity. If\r\nthe government will allow the motion to pass, and take the subject into\r\ntheir own hands, and inquire into it, through the magistracy, or by any\r\nother means, I, for one, am willing to leave the matter with them on\r\nthat condition, merely adding that I shall be happy to afford them any\r\nassistance in my power in carrying out their inquiry, and in enabling\r\nthem to annihilate this mischievous and demoralising system.\r\n\r\n_February 4, 1840._\r\n\r\n_Compliment to the Navy._\r\n\r\nI know a great deal of the gentlemen of that profession; and, for my own\r\npart, I have always had, and still have, the greatest and the highest\r\nrespect for them, and the very utmost confidence in them. I have always\r\nendeavoured to emulate their services in the service in which I have\r\nmyself been engaged; and I am sure that in nothing have I endeavoured to\r\nemulate them in a greater degree than in that confidence which they\r\nfeel, not only in themselves, and in the officers of their own rank, but\r\nin all officers and troops under their command.\r\n\r\n_February 6, 1840._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_Eulogium on Lord Seaton._\r\n\r\nI had the honour of being connected with the noble and gallant lord in\r\nservice at an early period of his life; and I must declare that, at all\r\ntimes, and under all circumstances, he gave that promise of prudence,\r\nzeal, devotion, and ability, which he has so nobly fulfilled in his\r\nservices to his sovereign and his country, during the recent proceedings\r\nin Canada. I entirely agree with the noble viscount in all that he has\r\nsaid, respecting the conduct of my noble and gallant friend, in\r\nremaining, under all circumstances, at his post, and in taking the\r\ncommand of the troops, although it was not thought expedient by the\r\ngovernment to place him again in the government of the provinces. I\r\nagree with the noble viscount in wishing that such examples as that\r\nwhich has been shewn may be always followed in her majesty's service;\r\nfor I must say that there never was a brighter example of fortitude and\r\ndiscretion than that which has been manifested by the noble and gallant\r\nlord.\r\n\r\n_March 27, 1840._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Opinion on the Printed Papers' Question._\r\n\r\nI wish--as, indeed, everybody wishes--that the House of Commons should\r\nhave the power of printing and publishing its papers. But what I want to\r\ndo is this--to provide that, when it proceeds to the sale of them, the\r\nlaw should take its course. As to the printing and publishing of papers,\r\nI have no objection, until it comes to the point of sale. The sale ought\r\nnot, in my opinion, to be made by the authority of the house; it ought\r\nto be made by individuals, and they should be responsible for what they\r\nsell, as they were previously to the passing of the resolution in 1835;\r\nand, up to that time, it must be admitted that the House of Commons and\r\nthe House of Lords had the advantage of all their privileges quite as\r\nmuch as they have had ever since. My lords, I must confess that I look a\r\nlittle further into this question than the mere matter of libelling\r\nindividuals. I consider all this as it affects the public generally;\r\nand, I say, the public is mainly interested in its being understood that\r\nthe House of Commons and the House of Lords are not to be the privileged\r\nsellers of libels against individuals.\r\n\r\n_April 6, 1840._\r\n\r\n_Libels on foreign Sovereigns ought not to be permitted._\r\n\r\nI remember reading with great satisfaction, the history of a great case,\r\nwhich was pleaded and argued at considerable length, some years ago, in\r\nthis country--I mean the case of the \"King v. Peltier,\" in the court of\r\nKing's Bench. That was the case of an action brought against an obscure\r\nindividual, for a libel which he had published upon the sovereign of a\r\nneighbouring country, with whom we were then in a state of peace and\r\namity. Now, I ask your lordships whether, supposing, in the course of\r\nthe late Polish revolution, the libels, some of which we have seen\r\nprinted in this country, and others which we have heard spoken of in the\r\nother, and, I believe, in this house of parliament, reviling, in the\r\nstrongest terms, the sovereign of Russia, had been stated in the\r\npetitions, or in the proceedings of the House of Commons, and had been\r\nprinted, published, and sold by its authority; I ask your lordships\r\nwhether such a proceeding would not have been calculated to disturb the\r\npeace of this country, and of the world at large? In short, I ask your\r\nlordships whether it is desirable that there should be an opportunity of\r\npublishing and selling, on the part of the two houses of parliament,\r\nlibels against the sovereigns of all the foreign powers in Europe? My\r\nlords, I am one of those who consider that the greatest political\r\ninterest of this country is, to remain at peace and amity with all the\r\nnations of the world. I am for avoiding even the cause of war, and of\r\ngiving offence to any one, and of seeking a quarrel, either by abuse, or\r\nby that description of language which is found in these libels. I am\r\nagainst insulting the feelings of any sovereign, at whom individuals may\r\nhave taken offence, and against whom they may seek to publish libels\r\nunder the sanction of parliament. Let them state what they please in\r\ntheir private capacity, and let them be answerable for it individually,\r\nas Peltier was. What I want is, that parliament should not, by the\r\ncombined privilege of publication and sale, run the risk of involving\r\nthe country in the consequences of a discussion of such subjects, and in\r\nall the mischiefs and inconveniences which might arise from it.\r\n\r\n_April 6, 1840._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Reasons why the Chinese stopped the Opium Trade._\r\n\r\nIt is perfectly true, as is stated by the noble earl, that the trade in\r\nopium has been carried on contrary to the laws of China. But then, my\r\nlords, it has been so carried on with the knowledge of the local\r\nauthorities on the spot, who received large payments, in the shape of\r\nbribes, or in the way of duties, possibly both, for allowing the import\r\nof this opium,--its admission into the ports of China. It appears that,\r\nalthough the trade was forbidden by the law of China, it was known to\r\nthe authorities of China, to the emperor himself, and to all the\r\nservants of the government, that it had existed for many years, and that\r\nthe discussion had continued for many months, upon the question,\r\nwhether the trade should be allowed, and continued, under a duty, or\r\nwhether it should be discontinued altogether. Allow me to ask the noble\r\nearl, who has contended so very strongly for the Emperor of China,\r\nwhether that morality was so very great while he allowed that trade to\r\nbe continued? and whether his morality can be improved in any respect by\r\nopium being introduced upon the payment of a large duty, instead of its\r\nbeing introduced by means of smuggling, and under bribes paid to the\r\nofficers of his government; and even, as it has been shown, from the\r\nexterior waters into the interior of the country, in the Mandarin boats,\r\nthat is, in boats, either in the service of the country, or, at all\r\nevents, under the charge of officers of the government? I really cannot\r\nsee the force of the noble earl's argument with respect to the\r\nillegality of the trade, when it is as clear as possible that its\r\nexistence was well known to the government of China, and that no step\r\nhad ever been taken to put it down; but, on the contrary, the means of\r\ncontinuing it, and of raising a larger duty upon it, were under\r\nconsideration; and, in fact, the trade was finally put down, and\r\ndiscontinued only because it was supposed that it occasioned the export\r\nof a larger quantity of native or Sycee silver.\r\n\r\n_May 12, 1840._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The Opium not the cause of the war with China. Defence of Captain\r\nElliot._\r\n\r\nThe noble earl says that this war is to be attributed to the opium!\r\nWhy? there was no British opium in China at the very time these other\r\noutrages were committed, and when this very language was held; and, as\r\nfar as I am able to judge, there was then no opium in the possession of\r\nthe British merchants there. An order had been issued to deliver it up,\r\nand this gentleman had gone down the river for the purpose of\r\nsurrendering the whole. The war, then, has grown out of another state of\r\ncircumstances. First of all, there was a claim for the surrender of an\r\nEnglishman to be put to death, because a Chinese had lost his life in an\r\naffray. Captain Elliot, as became an English officer, instituted an\r\ninquiry to discover whether a certain number of persons, stated to have\r\nbeen in an affray, had been guilty of the murder or not, and the result\r\nof the inquiry was, that he could not bring the charge home to any one;\r\nthat he had no reason to suspect any one. The Chinese government still\r\ninsisted that these six men should be given up. Captain Elliot refused,\r\nand that, I take it, is one of the causes of the war.\r\n\r\nAnother of the causes of the war is this--that a provision had been made\r\nthat matters should be restored to their former state, in proportion as\r\nthe opium should be delivered up; that the British inhabitants should\r\nhave the use of the native servants; that they should have the common\r\ncomforts of life, provisions, and all that was necessary for\r\nsubsistence; and, finally, that the trade should be re-opened, and\r\nmatters allowed to resume their usual course. After having given that\r\npromise, it is discovered that this Chinese lost his life in an affray\r\nin which American seamen were engaged as well as the English; and then a\r\nfourth proposition was advanced, which was this, that every master of a\r\nvessel, proceeding up the Canton river, should sign a bond, submitting\r\nhimself, and all on board his ship, to be dealt with according to the\r\nlaws of China. The noble lord has found fault with Captain Elliot upon\r\nthis, as well as upon another matter. Now, this objection is most\r\nextraordinary, and it rather tends to prove that the noble earl, though\r\nhe has paid great attention to this particular blue book, is not very\r\nwell acquainted with former transactions in that country, or he would\r\nhave found that former traders with China had invariably refused to\r\nsubscribe to such proposals, and that they had broken off the trade with\r\nthe Chinese, rather than do it; rather than give up British subjects to\r\nbe dealt with according to the laws of China. I think they acted most\r\nproperly; and that Captain Elliot, very much to his credit, refused to\r\ndo it; at the same time, he did no more than his duty. He did what\r\nothers would I trust have done under the same circumstances; and he is\r\nentitled to great praise for his firmness in resisting that demand. Then\r\nthere is another circumstance in which Captain Elliot acted as became\r\nhim. I allude particularly to his refusal to give up Mr. Dent. It was\r\ndeclared that the opium trade was not to be continued; that it was an\r\nillegal trade; and that dealing in opium should not be suffered. It was\r\nsupposed that Mr. Dent had been a person very much concerned in that\r\ntrade, and had made a large fortune, as I believe many others have\r\ndone, by that illicit trade. And Captain Elliot was blamed, when it was\r\nsought to have Mr. Dent given up, because he, her majesty's\r\nrepresentative and the chief superintendent of trade in that country,\r\nstepped forward and said, \"I won't allow this gentleman to be given over\r\nto the Chinese government, and to be tried as the Chinese government may\r\ndirect.\" I should, my lords, be ashamed of the name of Englishman, if\r\nthere could be found one in her majesty's service capable of acting\r\notherwise than this gentleman did, under such circumstances. The noble\r\nearl has stated that a great deal of difficulty would have been got rid\r\nof, if Captain Elliot had complied with the request of the Chinese; and\r\nthat the Americans gave up a seaman to be dealt with according to the\r\nChinese laws. I am sorry for it. I must say, it was not their duty to do\r\nso. They would have done better to have taken a leaf out of our book,\r\nand to have followed the example of the East India Company, to put an\r\nend to the trade rather than risk the life of one of her majesty's\r\nsubjects, or give him up to be tried by the Chinese government.\r\n\r\n_May 12, 1840._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf we cannot sustain our power in the Canadas, we must necessarily lose\r\nall our dominions in North America.\r\n\r\n_June 30, 1840._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nColonial responsible government, and the sovereignty of Great Britain,\r\nare completely incompatible.\r\n\r\n_June 30, 1840._\r\n\r\n_Importance of Colonies to the Mother Country._\r\n\r\nI have observed in this country, for some length of time, a growing\r\ndesire to get rid of our North American dominions--a desire that they\r\nshould become republics. This desire prevails amongst a very large party\r\nin this country. I am aware that there are also others--not, however,\r\nacting from the same motive--who desire that the separation should take\r\nplace; tranquilly, if possible, but that at all events it should take\r\nplace. In my opinion, these gentlemen are mistaken. It is my decided\r\nopinion, that, considering the resources and the power of these\r\ncolonies, this country would sustain a heavy loss, indeed, if these\r\ncolonies were to be separated from it.\r\n\r\n_June 30, 1840._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Religious Education must be provided out of the Funds of the Church._\r\n\r\nIt appears to me that there is no difference of opinion amongst us on\r\nthese points--namely, that means must be found of preaching the word of\r\nGod to the people of England; and I go further--for this point is also\r\nnot disputed--and I say that those means must proceed, in the first\r\ninstance, from the church, and that they must be exhausted before the\r\npublic is called on for other means; in providing those means, you will\r\nnot only be performing a duty incumbent upon you, but you will also be\r\nfollowing the example of every other nation in the world. It has been\r\nmy lot to live among idolaters--among persons of all creeds, and of all\r\nreligions; but I never knew yet of a single instance in which public\r\nmeans were not provided sufficient to teach the people the religion of\r\ntheir country. They might be false religions; I know but of one true\r\none; but yet means were never wanting to teach those false religions;\r\nand I hope that we shall not have done with this subject until we have\r\nfound sufficient means for teaching the people of England their duty to\r\ntheir Maker, and their duty to one another, founded on their duty to\r\nthat Maker.\r\n\r\n_July 30, 1840._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Necessity of administering Oaths._\r\n\r\nI entreat your lordships to pause, and recollect that the foundation of\r\nall justice is truth; and that the mode of discovering truth has always\r\nbeen to administer an oath, in order that the witness may give his\r\ndeposition under a high sanction. I hope your lordships will not adopt\r\nanother of those bills which have been before your lordships only a few\r\ndays, and which suggest, in truth, nothing more than a way of enabling a\r\nwitness, who thinks proper to say he has conscientious scruples, to\r\nescape the solemnity of an oath. I admit that the inconvenience of the\r\npresent state of the law falls on the community rather than on the\r\nindividuals; but, at the same time, I think that, by every one of those\r\nrelaxations, we shake the foundations of justice.\r\n\r\n_August 4, 1840._\r\n\r\n_Church-rate Martyrs--true state of the Case._\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, this case is a very simple one, and one on which there\r\ncan be no doubt as to the course which should be taken. Here is a man\r\nwho has been sued for a sum of money, which, it is understood, was\r\nlawfully due by him. The law renders him liable to pay that sum of\r\nmoney, and the law supports the proceedings against him for the recovery\r\nof it. This person could have easily avoided these proceedings, by\r\nsimply paying the sum of 5s. 6d., which was demanded of him; or he could\r\nhave gone into court and had the question fairly tried, whether he was\r\nlawfully bound to pay it or not, according to the laws of the country in\r\nwhich he resides; for, of course, he must be bound by the laws of his\r\ncountry, as well as all other British subjects. But he has not chosen to\r\ntake either course. He has said, \"I will not pay that money;\" and, in\r\nconsequence of his own conduct, a large amount has been incurred in the\r\nway of costs. These costs are not matters of speculation or amusement,\r\nthey are realities; they are sums of money paid for the labour of\r\ncertain individuals, for certain services performed in the execution of\r\ntheir duties, under the legal authority of the ecclesiastical courts,\r\nand in this suit. Now, those costs must be paid. Were we to let the man\r\noff from paying the 5s. 6d. for the rate, that remission would not get\r\nrid of his liability for the costs; these latter must be paid, either by\r\nhimself or his friends, or else they must be paid by the other party,\r\nby the lawful suitors, by the lawful plaintiffs, who had a right\r\noriginally to recover the money. They are the persons who would have to\r\npay the costs, unless your lordships consent to insert the clause\r\nproposed by my noble friend. Somebody must pay the costs after all. But\r\nit is said that the defendant is not to pay the costs, and that he is to\r\nbe let out of prison. Well, you may let him out, if you please; but,\r\nsurely, you would not call upon the plaintiffs to pay the costs incurred\r\nby _his_ conduct? That would not be justice. That would not be fair\r\nbetween man and man. Not a soul in this house could be of that opinion.\r\nIt is not consistent either with law or justice to throw these expenses\r\nupon those on whom the law of the country has laid the necessity of\r\nincurring them. Not they, but he who, by his own conduct, rendered the\r\nproceedings imperative, ought to be made to pay the costs.\r\n\r\n_August 7, 1840._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The Duke of Wellington not a War Minister._\r\n\r\nNo noble lord nor any other man that I know has done half so much for\r\nthe preservation of peace, and above all, for the pacification and the\r\nmaintenance of the honour of France and for the settlement of all\r\nquestions in which the interests of France were involved, as the\r\nindividual who is addressing your lordships. From the period of the year\r\n1814, down to the last month of my remaining in the service of the king,\r\nI did everything in my power for the strengthening and preservation of\r\nthe peace of Europe, and more particularly for the maintaining and\r\nkeeping up the best understanding between England and France. I repeat,\r\nthat I have done more than any one else to place France in the situation\r\nin which she ought to be in the councils of Europe, from a firm\r\nconviction,--which I feel now as strongly as I ever did,--that if France\r\nis not, then there is no necessity for the preservation of the peace of\r\nEurope, or for a sound decision on any subject of general policy. I am\r\nsure that the noble viscount would find, if he would take the trouble to\r\nsearch the archives of the government, papers written by me shortly\r\nbefore I went out of office in 1830, that would fully justify the\r\nassertion which I have just made. I am sure that those who were in\r\noffice with me were as anxious for the preservation of the peace of\r\nEurope as any politicians, be they liberals or otherwise. They were as\r\nanxious for the preservation of a good understanding between France and\r\nthis country, and that France should be on a perfectly good\r\nunderstanding with all the powers of Europe, and that she should take\r\nthe station which becomes her in the rank of nations, and which her\r\npower, her wealth, and her resources entitle her to.\r\n\r\n_January 26, 1841._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The Capture of Acre, the greatest deed of modern times._\r\n\r\nI have had a little experience in services of this nature, and I think\r\nit my duty to warn your lordships on this occasion, that you must not\r\nalways expect that ships, however well commanded, or however gallant\r\ntheir seamen may be, are capable of commonly engaging successfully with\r\nstone walls. I have no recollection, in all my experience, except the\r\nrecent instance on the coast of Syria, of any fort being taken by the\r\nships, excepting two or three years ago, when the fort of St. Jean\r\nd'Alloa was captured by the French fleet. That is, I think, the single\r\ninstance that I recollect; though I believe that something of the sort\r\noccurred at the siege of Havannah, in 1763. The present achievement I\r\nconsider one of the greatest deeds of modern times. That is my opinion,\r\nand I give the highest credit to those who performed such a service. It\r\nwas altogether a most skillful proceeding. I was greatly surprised at\r\nthe small number of men that were lost on board the fleet; and, on\r\ninquiring how it happened, I discovered that it was because the vessels\r\nwere moored within one-third of the ordinary distance. The guns of the\r\nfortress were intended to strike objects at a greater distance, and the\r\nconsequence was, that the shot went over the ships that were anchored at\r\none-third of the usual distance. By that means they sustained not more\r\nthan one-tenth of the loss which they would otherwise have experienced.\r\nNot less than 500 pieces of ordnance were directed against the walls;\r\nand the precision with which the fire was kept up, the position of the\r\nvessels, and lastly the blowing up of the large magazine, all aided in\r\nachieving this great victory in so short a time. I thought it right to\r\nsay this much, because I wished to warn your lordships against your\r\nsupposing such deeds as this could be effected every day. I repeat, that\r\nthis is a singular instance, in the achievement of which great skill was\r\nundoubtedly manifested, but which is also connected with peculiar\r\ncircumstances which you could not hope always to occur. It must not,\r\ntherefore, be expected as a matter of course, that all such attempts in\r\nfuture must necessarily succeed.\r\n\r\n_February 4, 1841._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_A blow at the Reformation._\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that that body (the Roman Catholic seminary of St.\r\nSulpice) was made a corporation by means of that ordinance, yet until\r\nthat property had been legally vested in them by the ordinance, they had\r\nno legal right whatever to it. * * * I was very much struck, I must\r\nconfess, when first I read the petition and the ordinance relating to\r\nthis subject; I was very much struck by the total departure it evinced\r\nfrom the principle of the reformation; a principle untouched up to this\r\npresent moment. And I entreat your lordships, whatever you may think on\r\nthe subject of this ordinance or other questions--I entreat the\r\nattention of your lordships and of the British public to this, that this\r\nordinance was the first blow openly struck by authority at the\r\nprinciples of the reformation; principles hitherto upheld, particularly\r\nthroughout Canada, from the period of the conquest down to the present\r\nmoment. I felt strongly on this point the moment I saw the petition and\r\nthe ordinance, and I still continue to feel strongly on the subject,\r\nsince I have heard the right reverend prelate state that it was the\r\ngovernor-general, not a member of the legislative council, but the\r\ngovernor-general of the province who brought forward this measure,\r\nacting on the part of the queen, whose rights, interests, and\r\nprerogative it was his duty to protect, and which he should have\r\nprotected in the legislative council.\r\n\r\n_March 5, 1841._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Australia._\r\n\r\nIt would be much the best plan to put an end to all the Australian\r\ncommissioners, to whom allusion is made in the bill before your\r\nlordships, altogether. A worse system was never adopted for the\r\nmanagement of a colony. We ought to place that colony in the same\r\nposition as the other colonies under the government of her majesty, and\r\nrule it in the usual way by the Colonial Office. I disapprove of these\r\ncommissions altogether.\r\n\r\n_April 30, 1841._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Evils of Reduced Establishments._\r\n\r\nIt was stated that the British were expelled from Canton on the 5th of\r\nMay. I, however, infer from what took place, that the British were\r\nobliged to retire at the end of March. Looking to the events of the\r\npresent year, they appear to me to be exceedingly unsatisfactory. And to\r\nwhat, I would ask, is this owing? It appears to me that this state of\r\nthings is to be attributed to improper advice. The interests of the\r\ncountry in various parts of the world, have not been properly protected.\r\nIf there is not a general war, we are placed in a situation that tends\r\nto it; and this arises from our having reduced our establishments far\r\nbelow what they ought to be, even in a time of peace. This was the true\r\ncause of the present state of things in China, and of delay and\r\nconsequent misfortune elsewhere; and I much fear that circumstances will\r\noccur to cause still further regret at the course that has been adopted\r\nwith respect to our establishments. I told ministers so at the time they\r\nwere making those reductions in 1837. I stated to them then that they\r\nwere not taking such care of our establishments as would enable them, in\r\nthe event of war, to contend with success against our enemies. The\r\nreduction of our establishments has been pursued in different parts of\r\nthe world, where we are engaged at present, and now we see the\r\nconsequence.\r\n\r\n_April 29, 1841._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Poor Law Commissioners must be made to do their duty._\r\n\r\nI voted for the Irish poor law bill, and proposed amendments, which, I\r\nbelieve, induced your lordships to pass the bill. I am sure that those\r\namendments had the effect of inducing others to approve of that bill,\r\nwho would not have done so if those amendments had not been introduced.\r\nI did all this on the faith and assurance, not only of the house and\r\nthe government, but of those gentlemen themselves, that it would be\r\ncarried into execution in Ireland, with the same strictness and fairness\r\nas it was in this country. In this expectation I have been altogether\r\ndisappointed, and for this reason I am determined, when I get the other\r\npapers, to read every line of them, and probe the matter to the bottom,\r\nin order to see where the mischief lies. But recollect there is not only\r\nthis case, but several other cases before your lordships, in every one\r\nof which there is corruption. We cannot stop here with the resolutions\r\nof my noble friend. The Clonmel case is a very gross case. The noble\r\nlord opposite has told us that the office can be but of little\r\nimportance, as the salary is only 10l. to 30l. a-year; but see what\r\npower the office gives. In this very case let your lordships see what\r\nhappened next day, when the brother-in-law of this individual was\r\nappointed valuator, a situation which puts the property of every man, in\r\nsome degree, in his power. We must go deeper into this question, if we\r\nwish to do justice to Ireland, and to the gentlemen who hold property in\r\nthat country. We must take care that their property shall not be left at\r\nthe disposal of such miscreants, and we must make the poor law\r\ncommissioners do their duty. I cannot think of asking him any question\r\non the subject, for it was sufficient for him to know that he was the\r\nnephew of a person called the archbishop, to be satisfied of his\r\nfitness.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt would be mere stuff to stop here; the persons on whom the house must\r\ncall are the poor law commissioners themselves. Let them be taught to\r\nfeel it their duty to keep a correct record of their proceedings, which\r\nthey shall be ready to produce at any time that the house or the\r\ngovernment may call for them. Let them be taught to feel that the house\r\nwill not permit such conduct as this, and we shall soon see an end to\r\nsuch abuses as those out of which the resolution of my noble friend\r\narises.\r\n\r\n_May 3, 1841._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Why Corn Laws were imposed._\r\n\r\nThese laws (corn laws) were not invented, nor have they been maintained,\r\nfor the purpose of keeping high rents in the pockets of noble lords, but\r\nthey were invented and have been supported for the purpose of\r\nmaintaining and supporting agriculture, and of maintaining this country\r\nindependent of all other countries and parts of the world; and it is\r\nalso perfectly true, as stated by my noble friend behind me, that such\r\nhas been the policy of England for centuries, sometimes by one mode, and\r\nsometimes by another; sometimes by imposing protective duties when corn\r\nrose above certain prices, and sometimes by giving bounties, and\r\noccasionally very large bounties, on the exportation of corn. But\r\nwhatever has been the means, the object has always been to support the\r\nagriculture of the country, in order to render this country, in respect\r\nof its subsistence, independent of other nations. This was the object of\r\nthe improved system introduced in the year 1828; this was the object of\r\nthose principles which have been maintained ever since; at least it was\r\nthe principle on which I gave those laws my support, and on which I more\r\nthan once asked your lordships to render this country dependent only on\r\nitself for subsistence. This was the object of the corn laws, and not\r\nthat dirty object which has been imputed to your lordships--and which, I\r\nmust say, it is too bad to impute to your lordships--of obtaining large\r\nrents from your land. It is also perfectly true, as has been stated by\r\nmy noble friend behind me, that there is not a country of Europe in\r\nwhich corn laws do not at this moment exist; but, nevertheless, I\r\nsuppose if it were proposed to repeal these laws, and adopt the measures\r\nrecommended by the petitioners, your lordships would be told of the\r\nquantities of corn that might be had from Russia and from Prussia, and\r\nother parts of the world. But are there no corn laws in those countries?\r\nHas the noble earl heard of no laws prohibiting all exportation of corn\r\nto other countries? That fact alters the whole state of the question of\r\ncorn laws in this country. The effect of such a state of things would be\r\nmost serious if there came a bad season here and there, too. Then,\r\nagain, has the noble lord not heard of the high duties imposed on the\r\nexportation of corn from those countries during the late wars? Have not\r\nyour lordships got evidence before some of the committees--have you not\r\ngot letters from some merchants at Dantzic to one of those governments\r\non the subject of the prices of corn in England, and on the rate of\r\nduties imposed at that port? and was it not stated that the increased\r\nprice obtained from England might be expected to enable those merchants\r\nto pay the duties imposed by their government on exportation? Let it be\r\nobserved, that I do not blame the sovereign to whom I allude for\r\nimposing those duties--I should not have blamed him if it had been an\r\nact of war, whereas it was a mere measure of finance. I do not say, that\r\nI agree with him in his notions of protection; but I say, that when I\r\nconsider it a question of protection, that sovereign is not to be\r\nblamed, and that his object was like that of your lordships, to secure\r\nthe subsistence of his subjects, and not to cause a rise of rents.\r\n\r\n_May 7, 1841._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The Corn Laws._\r\n\r\nThe first man who brought forward those opinions (Adam Smith) which I\r\nhave read as well as noble lords opposite, made an exception upon this\r\nvery subject. He excepted corn from the doctrines he laid down as to all\r\nthe other articles of trade. In relation to the subsistence of the\r\npeople he says, that we must always take care to ensure that subsistence\r\nwithin the country itself--and accordingly he excepts corn from the\r\nseveral doctrines which he lays down. I confess I have heard nothing\r\nduring these discussions to alter my opinion, that the corn laws which\r\nwere adopted almost unanimously in 1828, have perfectly answered the\r\npurposes for which they were intended, and have kept the prices as\r\nsteady as the nature of the commodity will allow. Yes, my lords, in this\r\ncountry, when we have produced corn for our own subsistence, and it is\r\nour object invariably to produce it, prices have been more steady than\r\nin any other country of Europe. It it my opinion, on all these grounds,\r\nthat these laws have operated as successfully as any laws could have\r\ndone.\r\n\r\n_May 11,1841._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Agriculture and Manufactures._\r\n\r\nI cordially concur in the feeling that the prosperity of the\r\nagriculturist must depend on the general prosperity of the manufacturer,\r\nand of commercial interests in general. There can be no doubt about\r\nthat, and then corn laws are supported, not with a view to the advantage\r\nof any particular interest or class of men, but with a view to render\r\nthe whole country independent of foreign countries in respect of its\r\nsupply of food. I believe that all parts of the country, and every\r\nindividual resident in it, are interested in this subject.\r\n\r\n_May 17, 1841._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Cotton and Corn._\r\n\r\nAllusion has been made to the increase in imports in cotton. It has been\r\nsaid but small profits were made upon the manufacture of this immense\r\nquantity of produce, but that appears to me to have no connection with\r\nthe question of the corn laws. The fact is, the improvements in the\r\nmachinery, and the introduction of steam, have enabled the manufacturers\r\nto manufacture with very little cost. They do not make the profit now\r\nthey did fifty years ago; but they still make profits, although\r\ndiminished by competition--not by competition with the foreigner, but by\r\ncompetition at home. Other manufacturers who were aware that profits\r\nwere to be made, although not so large as formerly, entered the field,\r\nbuilt new manufactories, established machinery, and thus introduced\r\nfresh competition.\r\n\r\n_May 25, 1841._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Grounds of Complaint against the Whigs in_ 1841.\r\n\r\nThese grounds are neglect and mismanagement of the finances of this\r\ncountry by her majesty's government, the future consequence of which, as\r\nhas been stated, it is impossible to foresee, and the improper,\r\nimpolitic and unconstitutional means which they took to recover\r\nthemselves. These things were proved by reference to the actual state of\r\nthe finances, when it was found necessary to review them in the last\r\nparliament; and it was shewn that, in point of fact, after a period of\r\nabout five years, a debt had not alone been accumulated of five\r\nmillions, but there had also been a vast deficiency in the public\r\nrevenue. This debt and deficiency are to be attributed to the practice\r\nadopted by her majesty's government of carrying on extensive operations,\r\nof which nobody approves, mind you, more than I do when done as they\r\nshould be, and at the same time not making due provision for the\r\nincreased expenditure, occasioned by their carrying on war in several\r\nplaces with a peace establishment, being the most crying of these evils,\r\nand neglecting to employ the proper means for meeting the increased\r\ncharge, and putting an end to the impending danger. The next allegation\r\nagainst them, my lords, is for not making financial provision in the way\r\nof ways and means for the expense and charge incurred by the country\r\nfrom the exertions made to put an end to the danger which menaced it. A\r\nnoble lord has stated that, though a large amount of army and ordnance\r\nwas kept on foot after 1831, no provision had been made for the\r\nadditional expenditure in the usual way of an application to parliament,\r\nbut that irregular and unconstitutional modes were adopted by her\r\nmajesty's government for finding means of defraying those expenses. In\r\nthis, my lords, my noble friend spoke but the simple truth. In one case\r\nthe whole charge of a war had been thrown on the East India Company, and\r\nthen converted into a debt on this country; in another the funds of the\r\nsavings' banks had been tampered with; in another the Exchequer bills\r\nhad been funded; and, in short, several most irregular modes has been\r\nadopted. Then, my lords, what happened? Besides these expenses; besides\r\nthe failure of the government to make due provision by the mode of ways\r\nand means to defray the charges incurred by their naval and military\r\noperations; besides these, my lords, her majesty's government thought\r\nproper to repeal a large amount of taxes, by which means they reduced\r\nthe revenue of the country to such a degree as materially and inevitably\r\nleft a most serious deficiency.\r\n\r\n_August 24, 1841._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Hasty adoption of Free Trade by the Whigs._\r\n\r\nMy lords, it is not more than fourteen months ago since I heard the\r\nnoble viscount (Melbourne) say,--making use of the strongest language I\r\never heard in opposition to a motion merely for taking the corn laws\r\ninto consideration,--the noble viscount on that occasion declared before\r\nGod, with reference to the abolition of the corn laws, that he believed\r\nthe man must be mad who dreamed of such a thing. Now, my lords, I do not\r\npretend to say that the noble viscount has not a perfect right to change\r\nhis opinions. I believe he thought that he had good grounds for doing\r\nso, and I think I have myself read the report which induced him to\r\nchange them. But this I do say, that, before your lordships and the\r\ncountry were placed in this situation in regard to the queen, the noble\r\nviscount was bound to give parliament and the country an opportunity of\r\nobtaining that knowledge and information as to the true merits of the\r\nquestion, which he imagines himself to have obtained.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is by such inquiries as these, my lords, calmly and patiently\r\nconducted, that men are enabled to judge respecting the consequences of\r\ngreat changes of this nature, and of the bearings and tendencies of each\r\nparticular part of what is intended to be done. But, instead of such a\r\ncourse being pursued, what has been done in the present instance?\r\nNothing. * * I further think, that the committee and report were _ex\r\nparte_ ones, upon which no legislative measures ought to have been\r\nfounded. But what I chiefly complain of is this, that before the noble\r\nviscount put this speech into the mouth of her majesty, he did not give\r\nus full and fair information to guide us as to what we ought to do. I\r\nbelieve, my lords, that conduct like this is sufficient to induce you to\r\nsay that the noble lords opposite do not deserve your confidence.\r\n\r\n_August 24, 1841._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Lord Melbourne's services to the Queen._\r\n\r\nI am willing to admit that the noble viscount has rendered the greatest\r\npossible service to her majesty. I happen to know that it is her\r\nmajesty's opinion that the noble viscount has rendered her majesty the\r\ngreatest possible service, in making her acquainted with the mode and\r\npolicy of the government of this country, initiating her into the laws\r\nand spirit of the constitution, independently of the performance of his\r\nduty, as the servant of her majesty's crown; teaching her, in short, to\r\npreside over the destinies of this great country.\r\n\r\n_August 24, 1841._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_England the best country for the Poor._\r\n\r\nWith respect to the corn law question, my opinions are already well\r\nknown. I shall not argue the propriety of these laws, but I shall be\r\nready to discuss them when a discussion is brought forward by a\r\ngovernment having the confidence of her majesty's parliament. But, my\r\nlords, I earnestly recommend you, for the sake of the people of this\r\ncountry, for the sake of the humblest orders of the people, not to lend\r\nyourselves to the destruction of our native cultivation. Its\r\nencouragement is of the utmost and deepest importance to all classes. My\r\nlords, I have passed my life in foreign countries, in different regions\r\nof the earth, and I have been in only one country in which the poor man,\r\nif sober, prudent, and industrious, is quite certain of acquiring a\r\ncompetence. That country is this. We have instances every day; we have\r\nseen, only within the last week, proofs that persons in the lowest ranks\r\ncan acquire, not only competence, but immense riches. I have never heard\r\nof such a thing in any other country. I earnestly beg of you not to lose\r\nsight of this fact, and not to consent to any measure which would injure\r\nthe cultivation of our own soil. I have seen in other lands the misery\r\nconsequent on the destruction of cultivation, and never was misery equal\r\nto it; and, my lords, I once more conjure you not to consent to any\r\nmeasure tending to injure the home cultivation of this country.\r\n\r\n_August 24, 1841._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Opinions on Abstract Questions of Policy inexpedient._\r\n\r\nMy lords, the noble viscount states, and he states truly, that it is not\r\na habit in this house to call on your lordships to give an opinion on\r\nabstract questions of policy. That, my lords, is perfectly true, and I\r\nhave myself endeavoured to bring the house to that view on more than one\r\noccasion, that is, to prevent the expression of any opinion on abstract\r\nquestions of policy, in the shape of an address or otherwise, until it\r\nshould be brought before your lordships in the shape of a distinct\r\nlegislative measure. More than once I have succeeded in persuading your\r\nlordships to withhold such opinion, and on some occasions, even, I have\r\nsupported the government (whig) against them, however much I may have\r\ndisapproved of their policy with regard to them.\r\n\r\n_August 24, 1841._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is at all times desirable that the sovereign should not be pledged in\r\nthe speech from the throne.\r\n\r\n_August 24, 1841._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Abolition of Oaths._\r\n\r\nThe foundation of all justice is truth, and the question is, how truth\r\nis to be ascertained. Before I can receive any application of this\r\ndescription, and before I can vote for the bill lately laid on your\r\nlordships' table, I would like to hear the opinion of some of those\r\nlearned men who are at this moment engaged in the administration of the\r\nlaw, and who must have made up their minds as to the best means of\r\nascertaining the truth. Hitherto it has been understood in this country\r\nthat the best means was by administering oaths. I am aware that the\r\nlegislature has made certain exceptions. It may be very well to make\r\nthese exceptions--and let further exceptions be made if they are\r\nexpedient--but I do say, that we ought to have some solemn examination\r\nof the question, and some certainty that the new mode proposed is as\r\ngood as the old one for ascertaining the truth, which, as is said, is\r\nthe foundation of all justice.\r\n\r\n_March 18, 1842._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The Income Tax only justified by Necessity._\r\n\r\nI can answer for myself, and I believe I can also answer for my\r\ncolleagues, that nothing but necessity could have induced us to propose\r\nsuch a tax. We are perfectly aware of all the inconveniences that must\r\nresult from it. We are perfectly aware of the provisions of the act of\r\nparliament upon your lordships' table. We are perfectly aware of the\r\nodious powers with which these commissioners and others must be\r\ntrusted--and we can reconcile it to ourselves only by the necessity of\r\nthe case. Your lordships must feel it. We have been now for several\r\nyears engaged in operations involving great expense in all parts of the\r\nworld. I will not say, my lords, that we have been at war, but, I\r\nbelieve, we have been at something as like war, if it be not war, as\r\nanything could well be. We are exactly in the situation of persons who\r\nhave incurred a great debt, and who are called upon to pay the bill. I\r\nsay again, my lords, that nothing but a strong sense of the necessity of\r\nthe case, and that there was no other course which we could take to\r\nproduce such a revenue as would enable us to meet the difficulties of\r\nthe country, or to do what is necessary for its prosperity, would have\r\ninduced us to propose such a measure; and it will not last one moment\r\nlonger than it shall be absolutely necessary.\r\n\r\n_June 17, 1842._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The Poor Law has worked well._\r\n\r\nI was one of those who supported the poor law as it was introduced some\r\nyears ago by my noble and learned friend, and I did so on ascertaining\r\nthe inconveniences and evils which attended the system of working under\r\nthe old poor law up to that period; and being sensible that the only\r\nremedy which could be found for those evils and inconveniences, was in\r\nthe measure proposed by my noble and learned friend. My lords, I have\r\nsince had the satisfaction of contemplating the working of the measure,\r\nwhich then became the law of the land, and I must say that I have been\r\nsatisfied with its results. It has, undoubtedly, improved the condition\r\nof the working classes, and it certainly does place on a better footing\r\nthe relations between the working classes and their employers. It has\r\nenabled those who had the care of them to provide better for the aged\r\nand destitute than has been hitherto the case; and it has, in general,\r\ngiven satisfaction throughout the country. My lords, I don't mean to say\r\nthat I approve of every act that has been done in carrying this bill\r\ninto operation. I think that, in many cases, those who had charge of the\r\nworking of the bill have gone too far, and that there was no occasion\r\nwhatever for constructing buildings, such as have acquired throughout\r\nthe country the denomination of bastiles, and that it would have been\r\nperfectly easy to have established very efficient workhouses without\r\nshutting out all view of what was passing exterior to the walls. I say,\r\nthen, that in some respects, the system has been carried farther than it\r\nought to have been, and, I shall also say that its features have assumed\r\na harsher character in some parts of the country than was necessary; but\r\nthis has been owing, I must admit, in a great degree, to the adoption of\r\nanother law by parliament, I mean what is called the dissenters'\r\nmarriage act, the regulations depending on which were connected with the\r\nexecution of the poor law act, and rendered necessary the establishment\r\nof unions in many parts of the country which were not yet ripe for the\r\nformation of those unions. But, notwithstanding the circumstances to\r\nwhich I have just now alluded, I must, in general, state my approbation\r\nof the working of this act. I have paid great attention to the subject.\r\nWherever I have resided, I have attended the meetings of guardians of\r\nunions in my neighbourhood; I have visited several workhouses in\r\ndifferent parts of England, and I must say that I never visited one in\r\nwhich the management was not as good as could be expected in such\r\ndistricts of the country, and which did not give universal satisfaction.\r\n\r\n_July 26, 1842._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe government of Lord Melbourne carried on war all over the world with\r\na peace establishment. That is exactly what we (Sir Robert Peel's\r\ngovernment) do not.\r\n\r\n_February 2, 1843._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n_Real cause of the Chinese War_.\r\n\r\nI was almost the only individual who stated that the real ground of\r\ncomplaint against the Chinese government was its conduct towards the\r\nperson employed in the service of her majesty, and representing her\r\nmajesty in China. I was the only person in this house who defended her\r\nmajesty's servants. I said that the war was a just and necessary war. I\r\nwill go further, and say, if it had been otherwise--if it had been a war\r\nsolely on account of the robbery of the opium--if her majesty's\r\ngovernment were engaged in that war, and if their interests and honour\r\nwere involved in it, I should have considered it my duty to make every\r\neffort for carrying it on with success, and have asked parliament for\r\nthe assistance which would have enabled her majesty's servants to bring\r\nit to an early and successful termination.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Eulogium on the Indian Army_.\r\n\r\nMy lords, I know something of that (Indian) army; I have served in its\r\nranks, and I know pretty well what its feelings are; and though there\r\nare different castes and religions composing it, the discipline of that\r\narmy, and the military spirit by which it is actuated, totally do away\r\nwith all such distinctions. You will never hear in India of any\r\ndifference of caste or religion in that army, any more than you would in\r\nthe ranks of the British army. All do their duty,--all are animated by\r\nthe true feelings of soldiers.\r\n\r\n_March 9, 1843._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Evils of the Press in India._\r\n\r\nThe state of things in that country is one of much greater difficulty\r\nnow than when I was there, because there is now established in India\r\nwhat is called a free press, but which I should make free to call a most\r\nlicentious press; and by referring to these papers your lordships will\r\nsee that the mischievous influence of that press is repeatedly\r\ncomplained of. For my own part, I must own, I do not see how the\r\noperations of war can be carried on in a satisfactory manner in India,\r\nwith such a press constantly exercising its influence, and connected\r\nthrough its correspondents with every cantonment of the army.\r\n\r\n_March 9, 1843._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The Union must be maintained inviolate._\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt of the intention of her majesty's government to\r\nmaintain the union inviolate; and it is the duty of every government,\r\nand I will say it is the determination of her majesty's present\r\ngovernment, to maintain that union inviolate, and to come down to\r\nparliament and call upon parliament to give her majesty's government its\r\nsupport in carrying into execution any measures which may he considered\r\nnecessary to maintain the union inviolate, and to preserve from\r\nturbulence the peace of her majesty's dominions.\r\n\r\n_May 9, 1843._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The House of Lords should disregard popular Clamour._\r\n\r\nAs to the remarks which are made on your lordships elsewhere, I am one\r\nof those animadverted upon, and I am glad to find myself upon this\r\noccasion in such extremely good company. For myself, I can only say that\r\nI have been for a great number of years in the habit of treating such\r\ncriticisms and such assaults with the smallest possible attention; and I\r\nshall continue to do my duty to the best of my ability, in the service\r\nof my sovereign, or elsewhere, and continue to treat the language\r\nreferred to with as little attention as heretofore; and I recommend\r\nnoble lords on both sides of the house to follow my example in this\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\n_May 15, 1843._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Sees of St. Asaph and Bangor._\r\n\r\nThere can have been no object in the measure (the bill for the union of\r\nthe sees of St. Asaph and Bangor), but to make all the arrangements in\r\nthe manner most convenient to the country generally. There could have\r\nbeen no desire to injure the dioceses of St. Asaph and Bangor, or any\r\nother district in the kingdom; but the object was to make a better\r\ndistribution of the revenues of the church, and to satisfy the public of\r\na sincere desire to effect such a reformation as would be a real one,\r\nand such as would give satisfaction, not only to those who were attached\r\nto the church, as my noble friend and myself, but also to others who\r\nlooked upon it with indifference.\r\n\r\n_May 23, 1843._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The Duke of Sussex._\r\n\r\nMy lords, his late royal highness was well known to all your lordships.\r\nHis royal highness frequently took part in the discussion of those\r\nsubjects which came under your lordships' consideration; and although it\r\nwas impossible for every person endowed with such acquirements, and\r\npossessed of such an understanding, as belonged to his late royal\r\nhighness, not to have felt strongly on the various events and questions\r\nwhich from time to time were brought under the consideration of this\r\nhouse, yet his late royal highness always treated those subjects,\r\nhowever exciting they might have been, with much moderation, and with\r\ngreat forbearance towards others with whom he might have a difference of\r\nopinion. I must do his late royal highness the justice to say, that\r\nthough I had the unhappiness to differ from him in opinion on several\r\nsubjects which came under discussion in this house, yet, notwithstanding\r\nthat difference of opinion, his late royal highness ever treated me with\r\nunvarying kindness, and with the utmost condescension. My lords, his\r\nlate royal highness having received the benefit of an excellent\r\neducation, and having in his youth passed a considerable portion of his\r\ntime in foreign countries, was a most accomplished man; and he continued\r\nhis studies, in all branches of literature and science, until almost the\r\nlatest period of his existence. His late royal highness was, during his\r\nwhole life, the protector of literature, of the sciences, and of the\r\narts, and of the professors and representives of all branches of\r\nknowledge. For a number of years his late royal highness was elected\r\npresident of the Royal Society, and he received the learned members of\r\nthat body in his house with the greatest amenity and kindness. Having\r\nhimself sedulously cultivated all subjects of literature, science, and\r\nart, his late royal highness was, I may say, the patron, protector, and\r\nfriend, of all those who pursued such studies, on every occasion when\r\nthat protection was necessary. But other praise belongs to his late\r\nroyal highness. His royal highness was not backward--on the contrary, he\r\nwas equally forward with all the princes of his family--as a patron and\r\nupholder, as a supporter and protector, of the various charitable\r\ninstitutions of this metropolis; and, my lords, up to the last moment of\r\nhis life, he was the friend of the indigent and the unfortunate wherever\r\nthey might be found.\r\n\r\n_April 27, 1843._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Reasons for the Dismissal of the Irish Magistrates._\r\n\r\nThese gentlemen having been some of the persons to instigate and\r\nencourage the assembly of those large meetings in Ireland, on which the\r\nfirst law authority had pronounced in writing the opinion that they had\r\na \"tendency to outrage;\" that \"they were not in the spirit of the\r\nconstitution, and may become dangerous to the State;\" the\r\nlord-lieutenant of the government could not put any confidence in the\r\nperformance of their duties by these magistrates and deputy-lieutenants,\r\nwho had thus excited these meetings, or who presided at them. Your\r\nlordships are perfectly aware that on one occasion it was proved that\r\nthese meetings had a tendency to outrage--indeed, outrage was actually\r\ncommitted. I told your lordships on a former occasion that there was a\r\ngreat difference in Ireland on the subject of the repeal of the union.\r\nNow, suppose that two assemblies representing such opinions assemble on\r\nthe same occasion and in the same neighbourhood, why it is obvious that\r\noutrage and bloodshed may occur, and it must be likewise obvious that\r\nthose magistrates and deputy-lieutenants are not officers on whom the\r\nLord-lieutenant can rely for carrying into execution measures for the\r\nrepression and suppression of outrage which he may think proper to take\r\non such an occasion. My lords I have besides to observe to your lordships,\r\nthat for a very considerable period of time it has been a matter of\r\nnotoriety in Ireland that the members of her Majesty's council, her\r\nmajesty's servants in this and the other house of arliament, declared it\r\nto be the fixed and positive determination of the government to maintain\r\ninviolate the legislative union between the two countries. Some of the\r\nmost distinguished members of both houses of parliament declared, in their\r\nplaces, that they had the same intention; and this declaration of opinion\r\nhas been communicated to the public more than once; and in no one instance,\r\nas I believe, has there been an intention avowed to promote the object of\r\nthis repeal of the union. Well, then, what must be inferred from the\r\nnotoriety of that fact? What but that the repeal of the union, so far as\r\na vote of parliament is concerned, is hopeless? It is to be carried then\r\nby intimidation, by force, and violence; and, of course, as the government,\r\nwhose duty it is to resist and repress such acts of intimidation, force,\r\nand violence, whenever they should be attempted, by all the means at their\r\ndisposal, cannot use such instruments as those who excite the people to\r\nappear at their head, the lord-lieutenant and lord chancellor have taken\r\nmeasures to remove them from the commission of the peace, and\r\ndeputy-lieutenancies of their several counties. This is the principle,\r\nmy lords, on which I conceive the government has acted.\r\n\r\n_June 9, 1843._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter what passed in both houses of parliament it became a matter of\r\nnotoriety that the opinion of parliament was, that the legislative union\r\nshould not be repealed, and that every effort on the part of the\r\ngovernment should be made to resist the attempt to occasion that repeal.\r\nThen, my lords, under these circumstances, the lord chancellor finds\r\nLord French and other magistrates calling meetings to repeal the union,\r\nassisting at the meetings, presiding at them, and urging all the\r\nproceedings. At this time the opinion of parliament was notorious, yet\r\nmeetings consisting of 10,000, 20,000, 100,000, no matter as to the\r\nnumber of thousands, continued. My lords, I wish to know with what\r\nobject they were continued? Was it with a view to address parliament to\r\nrepeal the union? No, my lords, they were continued to obtain the\r\ndesired repeal of the union,--by terror, if possible,--if not, by force\r\nand violence. And the persons calling these meetings, I beg your\r\nlordships to observe, were the magistrates, the very men who must have\r\nbeen employed by government to take measures to resist this violence, to\r\nprevent breaches of the peace, to arrest those who should be guilty of\r\nsuch breaches, and to bring them to justice; and then the noble lord\r\nsays, that the government ought not to have removed those magistrates\r\nfrom their situations, and that they ought not to draw a distinction as\r\nto the time when it became notorious to the whole world what were the\r\nviews entertained by parliament and the government on this important\r\nquestion. My lords, in this and the other house of parliament, no one\r\nwould have any idea of repealing the union except in regular course,\r\nlike another act of parliament; but with these meetings of 50,000 and\r\n60,000 men, was there any question of discussion? No, my lords, the\r\nquestion was terror, force, and violence. That was the ground on which\r\nthe lord chancellor told these magistrates after the views of the\r\ngovernment had become notorious, you must be dismissed if you attend, or\r\nexcite others to attend, such meetings. I am as much concerned that this\r\nstate of affairs should exist as the noble lord can be; but of this I am\r\nquite certain, that the way to be prepared is not to have in the service\r\nof the government--not to have government dependant upon the exertions\r\nof--a number of magistrates who have excited and encouraged these\r\nproceedings, assisting at and presiding over these very meetings. That\r\ncould not have been desirable, and I say that the lord chancellor and\r\nsituation as that of governor-general of India, an officer who was so\r\nfor little more than two years--an officer who has given satisfaction in\r\nso high a situation to those by whom he was intrusted and\r\nemployed--whose acts have been concurred in and sanctioned in every\r\ninstance; to recall that officer suddenly, making no provision for the\r\nperformance of the great duties which are to be performed, and which\r\nmust he performed in that country--to recall an officer in whom the\r\ngovernment fully confided, without the concurrence of that\r\ngovernment--is, my lords, an act, to say the least of it, that cannot be\r\ncalled a discreet exercise of the power which is conferred on those who\r\nhave so used it. My lords, I will say nothing--- I will advert to\r\nnothing that is not notorious--that is not strictly in reference to the\r\nact of parliament. I beg your lordships to observe, that the body which\r\ndid this act--which I must call an act of indiscretion, at least--that\r\nbody, as a body, has no knowledge whatever of the instructions sent out\r\nto the governor-general, and under which he acted. They stated reasons\r\nfor withdrawing the governor-general from India; but, as a body (except\r\nthe secret committee appointed under the act of parliament), they had no\r\nknowledge whatever of the instructions under which the governor-general\r\nacted, or of the events which had taken place in that country, except\r\nthat which is within the general knowledge of this and the other house\r\nof parliament, and the whole public of this country. And yet, my lords,\r\nthey take this responsibility upon themselves--having no knowledge of\r\nthe instructions which it was deemed at Waterloo. Very possibly not, my\r\nlords. Bear in mind what he said in respect to the augmentation of his\r\nnumbers, and the means of assembling those persons. He said on one\r\noccasion, that by the post of one night, he could collect the whole of\r\nthis force in different parts of the country; and it is perfectly\r\ntrue,--I have not a doubt of the fact.\r\n\r\n_July 14, 1843._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Remedial Measures of no avail whilst Agitation continues in Ireland._\r\n\r\nMy lords, I must say, that grieved as I am that there should be so much\r\ntruth in the representations made by the noble lord of the existing\r\nstate of the country, and of its prospects, threatened as they are by\r\nthe continuance of agitation, I must say, that no measure that could be\r\nproposed, no new measure which could be adopted, would have the smallest\r\neffect in removing any of these evils or inconveniences. My lords, the\r\nonly mode, the only course to be adopted on the part of the government,\r\nis to oppose a strong resistance to everything like a breach of the\r\npeace or public order, and to be prepared, as I hope they are prepared,\r\nto enforce measures for preserving quiet, and protecting property, in\r\nIreland. My lords, I know of no remedy but that for the state of affairs\r\nwhich exists at present; particularly as it appears that whether the\r\npeace of the country shall be disturbed or not, depends on the will of\r\none man, and his influence over the wills and actions of some thousands,\r\nwho possess influence in various parishes of the country.\r\n\r\n_July 14, 1843._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Agitation no Relief for the Poverty of Ireland._\r\n\r\nMy lords, it certainly is true that there is in Ireland a vast number of\r\npoor. I have been sorry to see that it is stated in some returns on the\r\ntable, that there are as many as 2,000,000 of poor in Ireland. My lords,\r\nit happens unfortunately, that in all parts of the empire there are\r\npoor; but I will beg to observe, that it is not in the power of this\r\ngovernment, nor of any government, nor of any parliament, in the course\r\nof a few weeks, or a few months, or, I may say, a few years, to relieve\r\nthe poverty of a great country like that, extending as it does to such a\r\nportion of the population. But, my lords, I beg to know whether poverty\r\ncan be relieved by this description of agitation for the repeal of the\r\nunion? Is poverty relieved by marches of twenty-five and thirty Irish\r\nmiles a-day, during the period of spring and summer, to hear seditious\r\nspeeches? Is poverty relieved by subscriptions of thousands of pounds to\r\nthe repeal rent, and the O'Connell rent, and other funds of that\r\ndescription? No, my lords, that poverty must be relieved by a\r\nperseverance in industry and sobriety; not taken up by fits and starts\r\nfor the sake of a more orderly appearance at seditious meetings, where\r\nthe people are marshalled by bands of music and flying colours. The\r\nevils, whence that poverty proceeds, are not to be cured in a day. The\r\nremedies must be some time in operation; and all I can say is, that the\r\ngovernment are sincerely desirous to avail themselves of every\r\nopportunity that may tend to benefit the people of Ireland, and to\r\nrelieve that poverty of which the noble lord so eloquently complains.\r\n\r\n_July 14, 1843._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Assistance of Foreigners to the Repeal Agitation.--Their Anti-English\r\nMotives._\r\n\r\nMy lords, I do not dispute the extent of the conspiracy--I do not\r\ndispute the dangers resulting from organization in Ireland--I have\r\nstated it publicly on more than one occasion--I do not deny it--it is\r\nnotorious, it is avowed, it is published in every paper all over the\r\nworld. I do not deny the assistance received from foreigners, not from\r\nforeign governments,--I have no right to say so,--but from foreigners of\r\nnearly all nations; for there are disturbed and disturbing spirits\r\neverywhere, who are anxious to have an opportunity of injuring and\r\ndeteriorating the great prosperity of this country.\r\n\r\n_August 8, 1843._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The Military in readiness to preserve the Peace in Ireland._\r\n\r\nI, whose duty it is to superintend one of those offices on which the\r\nexecution of the measures of the government depends, feel confident that\r\neverything that can be done has been done, in order to enable the\r\ngovernment to preserve the peace of the country, and to meet all\r\nmisfortunes and consequences which may result from the violence of the\r\npassions of those men who unfortunately guide the multitude in Ireland.\r\n\r\n_August 8, 1843._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Mr. O'Connell's Proceedings._\r\n\r\nTo plunder the public in Ireland of money for the purpose of O'Connell\r\nrent, or repeal contribution, or the lord lieutenant would not have done\r\ntheir duty if they had not removed those persons from her majesty's\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n_July 14, 1845._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The \"Monster\" Meetings in Ireland._\r\n\r\nThe noble lord (the Marquis of Clanricarde) has stated that these\r\nmeetings were not illegal. I certainly do not consider myself competent\r\nto decide whether they were or were not illegal. This I know, that they\r\nconsist of very large numbers--whether of 10,000 or 100,000 I am sure I\r\ncannot tell, and I do not believe any man can tell to a certainty. They\r\nare assembled in very large numbers, regularly organised, marching under\r\nthe lead of persons on horseback, with bands and banners, in regular\r\nmilitary array. After having attended these meetings, those present are\r\ndispersed by word of command, without trouble, violence, or breach of\r\nthe peace, and march back, perhaps twenty or thirty miles. * * * My\r\nlords, I have had some experience, in the course of a long life, which I\r\nhave passed in the service of the sovereigns of this country, of\r\nrevolutions. A distinguished author has written of the French\r\nrevolution. \"_On ne conspire pas sur la place_.\" There is no secret in\r\nthese transactions, and the reason why there is no secret is this, that\r\nthe great means of operation are deception of their followers, and\r\nterror in respect of their adversaries. Accordingly, we hear a learned\r\ngentleman exclaiming to his audience, \"Napoleon had not in Russia such\r\nan army as this is; the Duke of Wellington had not such a one repeal of\r\nthose laws upon which the reformation in this country has been founded.\r\nMy lords, I have already taken opportunities of warning your lordships\r\nagainst the assertion of such doctrines in this house, and I must again\r\nexpress a hope that you will observe and beware how they are introduced\r\ninto it, because you may rely upon it, that there is not an individual\r\nin this country, be his religious opinions what they may, be his\r\nposition what it may, who is not interested in the maintenance of the\r\nreformation. Not only our whole system of religion, but our whole system\r\nof religious toleration, in which so many people in this country are\r\ninterested, depends upon the laws upon which the reformation was\r\nfounded; and I therefore entreat your lordships to give no encouragement\r\nto doctrines that might induce a belief that there exists in this house\r\nany indifference upon the subject of those laws.\r\n\r\n_March 18, 1844._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The Compact entered into for the Maintenance of the Protestant Church\r\nin Ireland should be held sacred._\r\n\r\nThe Protestant church in Ireland has existed in that country for a\r\nperiod of nearly three hundred years, and was maintained in that country\r\nduring a century of contests, rebellions, and massacres; and during a\r\ncontest for the possession of the crown, the Protestants of that country\r\nencountered that contest, and kept possession of their church; and\r\nduring another century it was maintained through much opposition, and\r\nunder difficulties of all descriptions. At the period of the union, the\r\nparliament--who had the power to consent to the union, or to refuse\r\ntheir consent--stipulated that the Protestant church in Ireland should\r\nbe maintained, and maintained on the same footing as the Protestant\r\nchurch of England in this country. The parliament had, under the\r\nauspices of the king of this country, the power of either making or not\r\nmaking that compact. Your lordships entered into that compact with the\r\nparliament of Ireland, and I entreat you never to lose sight of the\r\nfact. I entreat you not to suffer yourselves to be prevailed upon to\r\nmake any alteration in, or to depart in the slightest degree from, the\r\nterms of that compact, so long as you intend to maintain the union\r\nbetween this country and Ireland. It is the foundation upon which the\r\nunion rests,--it is a compact which you have entered into with the\r\nparliament of Ireland, and from which you cannot depart without being\r\nguilty of a breach of faith, worse than those which have been referred\r\nto in other countries,--worse than those pecuniary breaches of faith\r\nwhich have been alluded to in the course of the discussion which took\r\nplace in your lordships' house this evening upon another subject. I\r\nentreat you to listen to none of those petitions or speeches which tend\r\nto the injury or the destruction of the church in Ireland. Do what may\r\nbe necessary,--do what it may be proper to do, in order to render that\r\nchurch more beneficial to the people of that country; but I entreat you\r\nto adhere strictly, in spirit and according to the letter, to the\r\ncompact you have made, and not permit it to be supposed in any quarter\r\nwhatever that you entertain the most distant intention of departing, in\r\nthe slightest degree, from that arrangement.\r\n\r\n_March 18, 1844._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The recall of the Governor-General of India, by the Court of Directors,\r\nan act of gross indiscretion._\r\n\r\nMy lords, I conceive that this right (of recalling the governor-general\r\nof India) is one which the court of directors are bound to exercise with\r\ndue discretion; as all bodies and all individuals ought to do, when they\r\npossess extraordinary powers under the provisions of the law. In such\r\ncases, my lords, they are hound to exercise that power with the utmost\r\ndiscretion. Now, my lords, I will venture to submit to your lordships,\r\nas the opinion of an individual who has had some experience in these\r\nmatters, that the exercise of the power belonging to the court of\r\ndirectors is not, in this instance, to say the least of it, a discreet\r\nexercise of that power. My lords, the court of directors has this power.\r\nIt has also the power of nominating a successor in the room of the\r\nperson recalled. But, my lords, it has no other power whatever, as your\r\nlordships will find in looking into the law on the subject--it has no\r\nother power whatever, my lords, except under the direction and control\r\nof the board of commissioners for the affairs of India, and for the acts\r\nof that board of commissioners her majesty's government is responsible.\r\nUnder these circumstances, my lords, I venture again to say, what I\r\nbefore said, that it is not a discreet act of authority to recall from\r\npower--to recall from such an important what not, is one thing; to\r\nexcite the common people of the country to approach as near as possible\r\nto the commission of crime, and to do all the mischief that is possible\r\nto be done to the country, without exposing one's own person, is another\r\nthing; but to corrupt the army is quite a different thing, which, I hope\r\nand trust, I may promise your lordships will not be fulfilled.\r\n\r\n_August 11, 1843._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Eulogium on Major-General Sir Charles Napier._\r\n\r\nMy lords, I must say, that, after giving the fullest consideration to\r\nthese operations (in Scinde), I have never known an instance of an\r\nofficer who has shown in a higher degree that he possesses all the\r\nqualities and qualifications to enable him to conduct great operations.\r\nHe has maintained the utmost discretion and prudence in the formation of\r\nhis plans, the utmost activity in all the preparations to ensure his\r\nsuccess, and, finally, the utmost zeal, gallantry, and science, in\r\ncarrying them into execution.\r\n\r\n_February 12, 1844._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Persons of every Religious Denomination interested in the maintenance\r\nof the Reformation._\r\n\r\nThe noble lord (Earl Fitzwilliam) has propounded to your lordships a\r\nsomething, neither the nature of which, nor the period at which it is to\r\nbe carried into execution, is he himself exactly certain of. Something\r\nor other must be done; to that something this country must make up its\r\nmind; the noble lord does not state what it is to be; but it is, at all\r\nevents, to involve the necessary to send out to that part of the\r\nglobe--and the act of parliament will shew they are bound to have\r\nnone--having no share in giving those instructions--in short, having no\r\nknowledge on which to found a judgment on so important a subject as the\r\nrecall of a governor-general, they took upon themselves to pronounce\r\ntheir judgment on the conduct of this officer, and to disapprove of it.\r\nNow, my lords, I must say, that having no knowledge which could enable\r\nthem fairly to pronounce their judgment on his conduct, or that could\r\njustify them in depriving the government and the country of the best\r\ninstrument--I say it again, the best instrument to carry on and perform\r\nthe various duties of that great office, making no provision whatever\r\nfor the performance of those duties which are now to be provided for by\r\nher majesty's government, is an indiscreet exercise of the powers they\r\npossess. My lords, as I have said so much on this subject, I will, in\r\norder to illustrate the indiscretion of this act (that is the best word\r\nI can find for it), go yet a little further. My lords, though I believe\r\nthis is the first time in the history of the government of India that\r\nthis extreme measure has been resorted to by the court of directors, it\r\nhas more than once been in contemplation; but upon the advice and\r\nremonstrance of the ministers of the day, the resolution of the court of\r\ndirectors has been always withdrawn. And it is the fact, that it has\r\nbeen in contemplation by these very gentlemen, with reference to this\r\nsame governor general, in the course of the last twelve months; but\r\nthey were at that time prevailed upon to withdraw that resolution, and\r\nnot to persist in the recall of my noble friend. This was previous to\r\nthe late great military operations in Gwalior, of which we have all\r\nheard with so much satisfaction,--operations which I am sure your\r\nlordships will have perceived from the perusal of the reports which have\r\nbeen laid upon your table, must have been founded upon the most just and\r\ndiscriminate measures, for the equipment and maintenance of the armies\r\nplaced in the field, under the direction and superintendence of the\r\ngovernor general--not the equipment only of these armies--but the\r\nsupport of the troops in the field, the maintenance of military\r\ncommunication, and the moans of advance and retreat--in short, all that\r\ncould tend to insure their success--were amply provided for. Then, my\r\nlords, suppose the case to have occurred of the court of directors\r\nthinking proper to recall the noble lord six or eight months ago, whilst\r\nthe measures to which I have just alluded were in contemplation, what\r\nwould have become of the great operations at Gwalior--operations carried\r\non under the superintendence and direction of my noble friend the\r\ngovernor general. Why, the gentleman who was senior in the council must\r\nhave succeeded my noble friend--a respectable man no doubt he is, but\r\nwithout the experience of my noble friend; and without the knowledge of\r\nthe manner of equipping armies, and making proper arrangements for their\r\nbeing called into action, it is needless to add, that such great and\r\nsuccessful operations as those to which I have alluded could not be\r\ncarried on, and I leave your lordships to judge what the situation of\r\nIndia would have been if that expedition had failed, and if such an army\r\nas the one which we have seen described in one of the blue books upon\r\nthis table had continued in existence, threatened, as we were, at the\r\nsame moment, by a similar body in the Punjaub, on the north-west\r\nfrontier, and with the province of Scinde still in an unsettled state.\r\nWhy, my lords, the danger would have been imminent, and this would have\r\nbeen the consequence of the recall of my noble friend six or eight\r\nmonths ago, a measure which was in contemplation, and was only prevented\r\nby our representations to those who have now committed this gross\r\nindiscretion of recalling the noble lord--it was prevented only by the\r\nrepresentations made to those gentlemen of the danger which would ensue\r\nto the public interest from the measures which they were about to adopt,\r\nthe dangers resulting from the impossibility that they would be able to\r\nprovide for events which most probably would occur if they recalled\r\ntheir officer without the consent of her majesty's government, who would\r\nthus be deprived of the instrument in their hands best fitted for\r\ncarrying their instructions into execution, while the directors, in this\r\ncountry, must be unable to direct the means in existence for securing\r\nthe safety of their troops, for guarding their frontier, for upholding\r\nthe honour of Her majesty's arms, and the security of our vast dominions\r\nin that part of the world. I say again, as I have said before, and I\r\nsay the least of it, when I pronounce it to be the most indiscreet\r\nexercise of power that I have known carried into execution by any body\r\npossessed of power since I have had a knowledge of public affairs, which\r\nI am sorry to say is upwards of half a century.\r\n\r\n_April 29, 1844._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_His Support of the New Poor Law (Ireland.)_\r\n\r\n\r\nI will take the liberty of reminding your lordships that the New Poor\r\nLaw was originated by noble lords opposite, while they were in the\r\nservice of her majesty, and that I gave the measure my support from a\r\nsense of duty, because I thought it was calculated to benefit Ireland. I\r\nhave throughout supported the measure; I proposed some amendments which\r\nI thought likely to promote its beneficial action; I have given it my\r\nsupport ever since; and I am prepared to do all in my power to ensure\r\nits successful operation.\r\n\r\n_May 17, 1844._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n   Absenteeism, Irish, deprecated, 220.\r\n\r\n   Abstract questions, opinions on them inexpedient, 474.\r\n\r\n   Acre, the capture of, the greatest deed of modern times, 460.\r\n\r\n   Affghanistan expedition, its conduct approved of, 445.\r\n\r\n   Agitation in Ireland, real meaning of, 192.\r\n     Deprecated, 260.\r\n   ---- characterised, 331.\r\n     Agitation by authority, 411.\r\n\r\n   Agrarian outrages, the, of 1830, 223\r\n   ---- in Ireland, caused by agitation, 385.\r\n\r\n   Agriculture and manufactures, 469.\r\n\r\n   Albocracy, the, 309.\r\n\r\n   Albuera, battle of, one of the most glorious in the war, 115.\r\n\r\n   Animosity should be forgotten when war is concluded, 58.\r\n\r\n   Anonymous letters, meanness of writing them, 118.\r\n\r\n   Army, how to avoid party spirit in, 84.\r\n     Control of by the crown, 96.\r\n   ---- British, can bear neither success nor failure, 97.\r\n   ---- in Portugal, croaking spirit among officers, 106.\r\n   ---- British, the worst men only enter as privates, 111.\r\n   ---- what they want is coolness in action, not headlong bravery, 115.\r\n   ---- officers, as well as soldiers, require keeping in order, 118.\r\n   ---- its morale important to discipline, 126.\r\n   ---- Indian, eulogium on it, 479.\r\n   ---- Indian, eulogium on it, and Lord Hastings, 135.\r\n\r\n   Asiatic policy contrasted with European, 86.\r\n\r\n   Australia, 463.\r\n\r\n\r\n   Ballot, the, and universal suffrage, dangerous, 427.\r\n\r\n   Belgium, its neutrality the foundation of its independence, 409.\r\n\r\n   Beresford, Marshal, characteristic letter to, 134.\r\n\r\n   Birmingham, riots in 1839, 427.\r\n\r\n   Bishops in Ireland, objections to reducing their number, 333.\r\n\r\n   Blockade, what constitutes one, 332.\r\n\r\n   Blucher, his vandalism averted, 132, 133.\r\n\r\n   Bourbons, their re-establishment necessary to the peace of Europe, 129.\r\n\r\n   Bribe, indignant rejection of one in India, 82.\r\n\r\n   British character for faith must be preserved in India, 89.\r\n\r\n   Buonaparte, his system hollow, 103.\r\n     His disgusting tyranny, 113.\r\n   ---- A general re-action predicted, 119.\r\n     Effects of his government, 128.\r\n   ---- The Duke will not be his executioner, 131.\r\n\r\n\r\n   Canada, plan of operations against the United States, 125.\r\n     Conduct of the Canadian leaders, 390.\r\n   ---- The rebels must be reduced, 390.\r\n     Objections to a legislative council, 392.\r\n\r\n   Canning.
