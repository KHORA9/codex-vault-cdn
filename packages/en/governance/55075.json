S. DOWN TO THE TIME OF HIS\r\nDEATH.\r\n\r\n1790-1826.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DR. RUSH.\r\n\r\n                                            POPLAR FOREST, August 17, 1811.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I write to you from a place ninety miles from Monticello,\r\nnear the New London of this State, which I visit three or four times a\r\nyear, and stay from a fortnight to a month at a time. I have fixed myself\r\ncomfortably, keep some books here, bring others occasionally, am in the\r\nsolitude of a hermit, and quite at leisure to attend to my absent friends.\r\nI note this to show that I am not in a situation to examine the dates of\r\nour letters, whether I have overgone the annual period of asking how you\r\ndo? I know that within that time I have received one or more letters from\r\nyou, accompanied by a volume of your introductory lectures, for which\r\naccept my thanks. I have read them with pleasure and edification, for I\r\nacknowledge facts in medicine as far as they go, distrusting only their\r\nextension by theory. Having to conduct my grandson through his course of\r\nmathematics, I have resumed that study with great avidity. It was ever\r\nmy favorite one. We have no theories there, no uncertainties remain on\r\nthe mind; all is demonstration and satisfaction. I have forgotten much,\r\nand recover it with more difficulty than when in the vigor of my mind\r\nI originally acquired it. It is wonderful to me that old men should not\r\nbe sensible that their minds keep pace with their bodies in the progress\r\nof decay. Our old revolutionary friend Clinton, for example, who was a\r\nhero, but never a man of mind, is wonderfully jealous on this head. He\r\ntells eternally the stories of his younger days to prove his memory, as\r\nif memory and reason were the same faculty. Nothing betrays imbecility so\r\nmuch as the being insensible of it. Had not a conviction of the danger\r\nto which an unlimited occupation of the executive chair would expose\r\nthe republican constitution of our government, made it conscientiously\r\na duty to retire when I did, the fear of becoming a dotard and of being\r\ninsensible of it, would of itself have resisted all solicitations to\r\nremain. I have had a long attack of rheumatism, without fever and without\r\npain while I keep myself still. A total prostration of the muscles of the\r\nback, hips and thighs, deprived me of the power of walking, and leaves it\r\nstill in a very impaired state. A pain when I walk, seems to have fixed\r\nitself in the hip, and to threaten permanence. I take moderate rides,\r\nwithout much fatigue; but my journey to this place, in a hard-going gig,\r\ngave me great sufferings which I expect will be renewed on my return as\r\nsoon as I am able. The loss of the power of taking exercise would be a\r\nsore affliction to me. It has been the delight of my retirement to be in\r\nconstant bodily activity, looking after my affairs. It was never damped\r\nas the pleasures of reading are, by the question of _cui bono?_ for\r\nwhat object? I hope your health of body continues firm. Your works show\r\nthat of your mind. The habits of exercise which your calling has given\r\nto both, will tend long to preserve them. The sedentary character of my\r\npublic occupations sapped a constitution naturally sound and vigorous,\r\nand draws it to an earlier close. But it will still last quite as long\r\nas I wish it. There is a fulness of time when men should go, and not\r\noccupy too long the ground to which others have a right to advance. We\r\nmust continue while here to exchange occasionally our mutual good wishes.\r\nI find friendship to be like wine, raw when new, ripened with age, the\r\ntrue old man's milk and restorative cordial. God bless you and preserve\r\nyou through a long and healthy old age.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WM. A. BURWELL, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                            POPLAR FOREST, August 19, 1811.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I am here after a long absence, having been confined at home\r\na month by rheumatism. I thought myself equal to the journey when I set\r\nout, but I have suffered much coming, staying, and shall, returning.\r\nIf I am not better after a little rest at home, I shall set out for\r\nthe warm springs. The object of this letter is to inform Mrs. Burwell\r\nthat a ring, which she left where she washed the morning of leaving\r\nFludd's, is safe and will be delivered to her order or to herself when\r\nshe passes. I have not seen the President since he came home, nor do I\r\nknow what has passed with Foster from the fountain head; but through a\r\nchannel in which I have confidence, I learn he has delivered a formal\r\nnote in the name of his government, declaring that the circumstances\r\nof the war oblige them to take possession of the ocean, and permit no\r\ncommerce on it but through their ports. Thus their purpose is at length\r\navowed. They cannot from their own resources maintain the navy necessary\r\nto retain the dominion of the ocean, and mean that other nations shall\r\nbe assessed to maintain their own chains. Should the king die, as is\r\nprobable, although the ministry which would come in stand so committed\r\nto repeal the orders of Council, I doubt if the nation will permit it.\r\nFor the usurpation of the sea has become a national disease. This state\r\nof things annihilates the culture of tobacco, except of about 15,000\r\nhhds. on the prime lands. Wheat and Flour keep up. Wheat was at 9s. 6d.\r\nat Richmond ten days ago. I have sold mine here at the Richmond price,\r\nabating 2s., but 8s. a bushel has been offered for machined wheat. Present\r\nme respectfully to Mrs. Burwell, and accept assurances of affectionate\r\nrespect and esteem.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. PEALE.\r\n\r\n                                            POPLAR FOREST, August 20, 1811.\r\n\r\nIt is long, my dear Sir, since we have exchanged a letter. Our former\r\ncorrespondence had always some little matter of business interspersed;\r\nbut this being at an end, I shall still be anxious to hear from you\r\nsometimes, and to know that you are well and happy. I know indeed that\r\nyour system is that of contentment under any situation. I have heard that\r\nyou have retired from the city to a farm, and that you give your whole\r\ntime to that. Does not the museum suffer? And is the farm as interesting?\r\nHere, as you know, we are all farmers, but not in a pleasing style. We\r\nhave so little labor in proportion to our land that, although perhaps we\r\nmake more profit from the same labor, we cannot give to our grounds that\r\nstyle of beauty which satisfies the eye of the amateur. Our rotations are\r\ncorn, wheat, and clover, or corn, wheat, clover and clover, or wheat,\r\ncorn, wheat, clover and clover; preceding the clover by a plastering.\r\nBut some, instead of clover substitute mere rest, and all are slovenly\r\nenough. We are adding the care of Merino sheep. I have often thought\r\nthat if heaven had given me choice of my position and calling, it should\r\nhave been on a rich spot of earth, well watered, and near a good market\r\nfor the productions of the garden. No occupation is so delightful to me\r\nas the culture of the earth, and no culture comparable to that of the\r\ngarden. Such a variety of subjects, some one always coming to perfection,\r\nthe failure of one thing repaired by the success of another, and instead\r\nof one harvest a continued one through the year. Under a total want of\r\ndemand except for our family table, I am still devoted to the garden.\r\nBut though an old man, I am but a young gardener.\r\n\r\nYour application to whatever you are engaged in I know to be incessant.\r\nBut Sundays and rainy days are always days of writing for the farmer.\r\nThink of me sometimes when you have your pen in hand, and give me\r\ninformation of your health and occupations; and be always assured of my\r\ngreat esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. CLAY.\r\n\r\n                                            POPLAR FOREST, August 23, 1811.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--While here, and much confined to the house by my rheumatism,\r\nI have amused myself with calculating the hour lines of an horizontal\r\ndial for the latitude of this place, which I find to be 37° 22´ 26´´.\r\nThe calculations are for every five minutes of time, and are always\r\nexact to within less than half a second of a degree. As I do not know\r\nthat any body here has taken this trouble before, I have supposed a copy\r\nwould be acceptable to you. It may be a good exercise for Master Cyrus\r\nto make you a dial by them. He will need nothing but a protractor, or a\r\nline of chords and dividers. A dial of size, say of from twelve inches to\r\ntwo feet square, is the cheapest and most accurate measure of time for\r\ngeneral use, and would I suppose be more common if every one possessed\r\nthe proper horary lines for his own latitude. Williamsburg being very\r\nnearly in the parallel of Poplar Forest, the calculations now sent would\r\nserve for all the counties in the line between that place and this, for\r\nyour own place, New London, and Lynchburg in this neighborhood. Slate,\r\nas being less affected by the sun, is preferable to wood or metal, and\r\nneeds but a saw and plane to prepare it, and a knife point to mark the\r\nlines and figures. If worth the trouble, you will of course use the\r\npaper enclosed; if not, some of your neighbors may wish to do it, and\r\nthe effect to be of some use to you will strengthen the assurances of\r\nmy great esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO LEVI LINCOLN, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, August 25, 1811.\r\n\r\nIt is long, my good friend, since we have exchanged a letter; and yet\r\nI demur to all prescription against it. I cannot relinquish the right\r\nof correspondence with those I have learnt to esteem. If the extension\r\nof common acquaintance in public life be an inconvenience, that with\r\nselect worth is more than a counterpoise. Be assured your place is high\r\namong those whose remembrance I have brought with me into retirement,\r\nand cherish with warmth. I was overjoyed when I heard you were appointed\r\nto the supreme bench of national justice, and as much mortified when I\r\nheard you had declined it. You are too young to be entitled to withdraw\r\nyour services from your country. You cannot yet number the _quadraginta\r\nstipendia_ of the veteran. Our friends, whom we left behind, have ceased\r\nto be friends among themselves. I am sorry for it, on their account\r\nand on my own, for I have sincere affection for them all. I hope it\r\nwill produce no schisms among us, no desertions from our ranks; that no\r\nEssex man will find matter of triumph in it. The secret treasons of his\r\nheart, and open rebellions on his tongue, will still be punished, while\r\n_in fieri_, by the detestation of his country, and by its vengeance in\r\nthe overt act. What a pity that history furnishes so many abuses of the\r\npunishment by exile, the most rational of all punishments for meditated\r\ntreason. Their great king beyond the water would doubtless receive them as\r\nkindly as his Asiatic prototype did the fugitive aristocracy of Greece.\r\nBut let us turn to good-humored things. How do you do? What are you\r\ndoing? Does the farm or the study occupy your time, or each by turns? Do\r\nyou read law or divinity? And which affords the most curious and cunning\r\nlearning? Which is most disinterested? And which was it that crucified\r\nits Saviour? Or were the two professions united among the Jews? In that\r\ncase, what must their Caiaphases have been? Answer me these questions,\r\nor any others you like better, but let me hear from you and know that\r\nyou are well and happy. That you may long continue so is the prayer of\r\nyours affectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. JAMES L. EDWARDS.\r\n\r\n                                             MONTICELLO, September 5, 1811.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your letter of August 20th has truly surprised me. In this it is\r\nsaid that, _for certain services performed_ by Mr. James Lyon and Mr.\r\nSamuel Morse, formerly editors of the Savannah Republican, I promised\r\nthem the sum of one thousand dollars. This, Sir, is totally unfounded. I\r\nnever promised to any printer on earth the sum of one thousand dollars,\r\nnor any other sum, for certain services performed, or for any services\r\nwhich that expression would imply. I have had no accounts with printers\r\nbut for their newspapers, for which I have paid always the ordinary price\r\nand no more. I have occasionally joined in moderate contributions to\r\nprinters, as I have done to other descriptions of persons, distressed or\r\npersecuted, not by promise, but the actual payment of what I contributed.\r\nWhen Mr. Morse went to Savannah, he called on me and told me he meant to\r\npublish a paper there, for which I subscribed, and paid him the year in\r\nadvance. I continued to take it from his successors, Everett & McLean,\r\nand Everett & Evans, and paid for it at different epochs up to December\r\n31, 1808, when I withdrew my subscription. You say McLean informed you\r\n\"he had some expectation of getting the money, as he had received a\r\nletter from me on the subject.\" If such a letter exists under my name,\r\nit is a forgery. I never wrote but a single letter to him, that was of\r\nthe 28th of January, 1810, and was on the subject of the last payment\r\nmade for his newspaper, and on no other subject; and I have two receipts\r\nof his, (the last dated March 9, 1809,) of payments for his paper, both\r\nstating to be _in full of all demands_, and a letter of the 17th of April,\r\n1810, in reply to mine, manifestly showing he had no demand against me\r\nof any other nature. The promise is said to have been made to Morse &\r\nLyon. Were Mr. Morse living, I should appeal to him with confidence, as\r\nI believe him to have been a very honest man. Mr. Lyon I suppose to be\r\nliving, and will, I am sure, acquit me of any such transaction as that\r\nalleged. The truth, then, being that I never made the promise suggested,\r\nnor any one of a like nature to any printer or other person whatever,\r\nevery principle of justice and of self-respect requires that I should\r\nnot listen to any such demand.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. JAMES LYON.\r\n\r\n                                             MONTICELLO, September 5, 1811.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I enclose you the copy of a letter I have received from a James\r\nL. Edwards, of Boston. You will perceive at once its swindling object.\r\nIt appeals to two dead men, and one, (yourself,) whom he supposes I\r\ncannot get at. I have written him an answer which may perhaps prevent\r\nhis persevering in the attempt, for the whole face of his letter betrays\r\na consciousness of its guilt. But perhaps he may expect that I would\r\nsacrifice a sum of money rather than be disturbed with encountering a bold\r\nfalsehood. In this he is mistaken; and to prepare to meet him, should\r\nhe repeat his demand, and considering that he has presumed to implicate\r\nyour name in this attempt, I take the liberty of requesting a letter\r\nfrom you bearing testimony to the truth of my never having made to you,\r\nor within your knowledge or information, any such promise to yourself,\r\nyour partner Morse, or any other. My confidence in your character leaves\r\nme without a doubt of your honest aid in repelling this base and bold\r\nattempt to fix on me practices to which no honors or powers in this world\r\nwould ever have induced me to stoop. I have solicited none, intrigued\r\nfor none. Those which my country has thought proper to confide to me\r\nhave been of their own mere motion, unasked by me. Such practices as\r\nthis letter-writer imputes to me, would have proved me unworthy of their\r\nconfidence.\r\n\r\nIt is long since I have known anything of your situation or pursuits. I\r\nhope they have been successful, and tender you my best wishes that they\r\nmay continue so, and for your own health and happiness.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DOCTOR PATTERSON.\r\n\r\n                                            MONTICELLO, September 11, 1811.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--The enclosed work came to me without a scrip of a pen\r\nother than what you see in the title-page--\"A Monsieur le President\r\nde la Société.\" From this I conclude it intended for the Philosophical\r\nSociety, and for them I now enclose it to you. You will find the notes\r\nreally of value. They embody and ascertain to us all the scraps of\r\nnew discoveries which we have learned in detached articles from less\r\nauthentic publications. M. Goudin has generally expressed his measures\r\naccording to the old as well as the new standard, which is a convenience\r\nto me, as I do not make a point of retaining the last in my memory.\r\nI confess, indeed, I do not like the new system of French measures,\r\nbecause not the best, and adapted to a standard accessible to themselves\r\nexclusively, and to be obtained by other nations only from them. For, on\r\nexamining the map of the earth, you will find no meridian on it but the\r\none passing through their country, offering the extent of land on both\r\nsides of the 45th degree, and terminating at both ends in a portion of\r\nthe ocean which the conditions of the problem for an universal standard\r\nof measures require. Were all nations to agree therefore to adopt this\r\nstandard, they must go to Paris to ask it; and they might as well long\r\nago have all agreed to adopt the French foot, the standard of which they\r\ncould equally have obtained from Paris. Whereas the pendulum is equally\r\nfixed by the laws of nature, is in possession of every nation, may be\r\nverified everywhere and by every person, and at an expense within every\r\none's means. I am not therefore without a hope that the other nations\r\nof the world will still concur, some day, in making the pendulum the\r\nbasis of a common system of measures, weights and coins, which applied\r\nto the present metrical systems of France and of other countries, will\r\nrender them all intelligible to one another. England and this country\r\nmay give it a beginning, notwithstanding the war they are entering\r\ninto. The republic of letters is unaffected by the wars of geographical\r\ndivisions of the earth. France, by her power and science, now bears down\r\neverything. But that power has its measure in time by the life of one\r\nman. The day cannot be distant in the history of human revolutions, when\r\nthe indignation of mankind will burst forth, and an insurrection of the\r\nuniverse against the political tyranny of France will overwhelm all her\r\narrogations. Whatever is most opposite to them will be most popular, and\r\nwhat is reasonable therefore in itself, cannot fail to be adopted the\r\nsooner from that motive. But why leave this adoption to the tardy will\r\nof governments who are always, in their stock of information, a century\r\nor two behind the intelligent part of mankind, and who have interests\r\nagainst touching ancient institutions? Why should not the college of the\r\nliterary societies of the world adopt the second pendulum as the unit\r\nof measure on the authorities of reason, convenience and common consent?\r\nAnd why should not our society open the proposition by a circular letter\r\nto the other learned institutions of the earth? If men of science,\r\nin their publications, would express measures always in multiples and\r\ndecimals of the pendulum, annexing their value in municipal measures as\r\nbotanists add the popular to the botanical names of plants, they would\r\nsoon become familiar to all men of instruction, and prepare the way for\r\nlegal adoptions. At any rate, it would render the writers of every nation\r\nintelligible to the readers of every other, when expressing the measures\r\nof things. The French, I believe, have given up their Decada Calendar,\r\nbut it does not appear that they retire from the centesimal division of\r\nthe quadrant. On the contrary, M. Borda has calculated according to that\r\ndivision, new trigonometrical tables not yet, I believe, printed. In the\r\nexcellent tables of Callet, lately published by Didot, in stereotype,\r\nhe has given a table of Logarithmic lines and tangents for the hundred\r\ndegrees of the quadrant, abridged from Borda's manuscript. But he has\r\ngiven others for the sexagesimal division, which being for every 10´´\r\nthrough the whole table, are more convenient than Hutton's, Scherwin's,\r\nor any of their predecessors. It cannot be denied that the centesimal\r\ndivision would facilitate our arithmetic, and that it might have been\r\npreferable had it been originally adopted, as a numeration by eighths\r\nwould have been more convenient than by tens. But the advantages would\r\nnot now compensate the embarrassments of a change.\r\n\r\nI extremely regret the not being provided with a time-piece equal to the\r\nobservations of the approaching eclipse of the sun. Can you tell me what\r\nwould be the cost in Philadelphia of a clock, the time-keeping part of\r\nwhich should be perfect? And what the difference of cost between a wooden\r\nand gridiron pendulum? To be of course without a striking apparatus, as\r\nit would be wanted for astronomical purposes only. Accept assurances of\r\naffectionate esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CLEMENT CAINE, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                            MONTICELLO, September 16, 1811.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your favor of April 2d was not received till the 23d of June\r\nlast, with the volume accompanying it, for which be pleased to accept\r\nmy thanks. I have read it with great satisfaction, and received from\r\nit information, the more acceptable as coming from a source which could\r\nbe relied on. The retort on European censors, of their own practices on\r\nthe liberties of man, the inculcation on the master of the moral duties\r\nwhich he owes to the slave, in return for the benefits of his service,\r\nthat is to say, of food, clothing, care in sickness, and maintenance\r\nunder age and disability, so as to make him in fact as comfortable and\r\nmore secure than the laboring man in most parts of the world; and the\r\nidea suggested of substituting free whites in all household occupations\r\nand manual arts, thus lessening the call for the other kind of labor,\r\nwhile it would increase the public security, give great merit to the\r\nwork, and will, I have no doubt, produce wholesome impressions. The\r\nhabitual violation of the equal rights of the colonist by the dominant\r\n(for I will not call them the mother) countries of Europe, the invariable\r\nsacrifice of their highest interests to the minor advantages of any\r\nindividual trade or calling at home, are as immoral in principle as the\r\ncontinuance of them is unwise in practice, after the lessons they have\r\nreceived. What, in short, is the whole system of Europe towards America\r\nbut an atrocious and insulting tyranny? One hemisphere of the earth,\r\nseparated from the other by wide seas on both sides, having a different\r\nsystem of interests flowing from different climates, different soils,\r\ndifferent productions, different modes of existence, and its own local\r\nrelations and duties is made subservient to all the petty interests of\r\nthe other, to _their_ laws, _their_ regulations, _their_ passions and\r\nwars, and interdicted from social intercourse, from the interchange of\r\nmutual duties and comforts with their neighbors, enjoined on all men by\r\nthe laws of nature. Happily these abuses of human rights are drawing\r\nto a close on both our continents, and are not likely to survive the\r\npresent mad contest of the lions and tigers of the other. Nor does it\r\nseem certain that the insular colonies will not soon have to take care\r\nof themselves, and to enter into the general system of independence\r\nand free intercourse with their neighboring and natural friends. The\r\nacknowledged depreciation of the paper circulation of England, with the\r\nknown laws of its rapid progression to bankruptcy, will leave that nation\r\nshortly without revenue, and without the means of supporting the naval\r\npower necessary to maintain dominion over the rights and interests of\r\ndifferent nations. The intention too, which they now formally avow, of\r\ntaking possession of the ocean as their exclusive domain, and of suffering\r\nno commerce on it but through their ports, makes it the interest of\r\nall mankind to contribute their efforts to bring such usurpations to an\r\nend. We have hitherto been able to avoid professed war, and to continue\r\nto our industry a more salutary direction. But the determination to\r\ntake all our vessels bound to any other than her ports, amounting to\r\nall the war she can make (for we fear no invasion), it would be folly\r\nin us to let that war be all on one side only, and to make no effort\r\ntowards indemnification and retaliation by reprisal. That a contest\r\nthus forced on us by a nation a thousand leagues from us both, should\r\nplace your country and mine in relations of hostility, who have not a\r\nsingle motive or interest but of mutual friendship and interchange of\r\ncomforts, shows the monstrous character of the system under which we\r\nlive. But however, in the event of war, greedy individuals on both sides,\r\navailing themselves of its laws, may commit depredations on each other,\r\nI trust that our quiet inhabitants, conscious that no cause exists but\r\nfor neighborly good will, and the furtherance of common interests, will\r\nfeel only those brotherly affections which nature has ordained to be\r\nthose of our situation.\r\n\r\nA letter of thanks for a good book has thus run away from its subject\r\ninto fields of speculation into which discretion perhaps should have\r\nforbidden me to enter, and for which an apology is due. I trust that\r\nthe reflections I hazard will be considered as no more than what they\r\nreally are, those of a private individual, withdrawn from the councils\r\nof his country, uncommunicating with them, and responsible alone for any\r\nerrors of fact or opinion expressed; as the reveries, in short, of an\r\nold man, who, looking beyond the present day, looks into times not his\r\nown, and as evidences of confidence in the liberal mind of the person\r\nto whom they are so freely addressed. Permit me, however, to add to them\r\nmy best wishes for his personal happiness, and assurances of the highest\r\nconsideration and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. EPPES.\r\n\r\n                                            MONTICELLO, September 29, 1811.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--The enclosed letter came under cover to me without any\r\nindication from what quarter it came.\r\n\r\nOur latest arrival brings information of the death of the king of England.\r\nIts coming from Ireland and not direct from England would make it little\r\nworthy of notice, were not the event so probable. On the 26th of July the\r\nEnglish papers say he was expected hourly to expire. This vessel sailed\r\nfrom Ireland the 4th of August, and says an express brought notice the\r\nday before to the government that he died on the 1st; but whether on\r\nthat day or not, we may be certain he is dead, and entertain, therefore,\r\na hope that a change of ministers will produce that revocation of the\r\norders of council for which they stand so committed. In this event we\r\nmay still remain at peace, and that probably concluded between the other\r\npowers. I am so far, in that case, from believing that our reputation\r\nwill be tarnished by our not having mixed in the mad contests of the rest\r\nof the world that, setting aside the ravings of pepper-pot politicians,\r\nof whom there are enough in every age and country, I believe it will\r\nplace us high in the scale of wisdom, to have preserved our country\r\ntranquil and prosperous during a contest which prostrated the honor,\r\npower, independence, laws and property of every country on the other\r\nside of the Atlantic. Which of them have better preserved their honor?\r\nHas Spain, has Portugal, Italy, Switzerland, Holland, Prussia, Austria,\r\nthe other German powers, Sweden, Denmark, or even Russia? And would we\r\naccept of the infamy of France or England in exchange for our honest\r\nreputation, or of the result of their enormities, despotism to the\r\none, and bankruptcy and prostration to the other, in exchange for the\r\nprosperity, the freedom and independence which we have preserved safely\r\nthrough the wreck? The bottom of my page warns me it is time to present\r\nmy homage to Mrs. Eppes, and to yourself and Francis my affectionate\r\nadieux.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. PAINE TODD.\r\n\r\n                                              MONTICELLO, October 10, 1811.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--According to promise I send you our observations of the solar\r\neclipse of September 17th. We had, you know, a perfect observation of\r\nthe passage of the sun over the meridian, and the eclipse began so soon\r\nafter as to leave little room for error from the time-piece. Her rate\r\nof going, however, was ascertained by ten days' subsequent observation\r\nand comparison with the sun, and the times, as I now give them to you,\r\nare corrected by these. I have no confidence in the times of the first\r\nand ultimate contacts, because you know we were not early enough on the\r\nwatch, deceived by our time-piece which was too slow. The impression on\r\nthe sun was too sensible when we first observed it, to be considered\r\nas the moment of commencement, and the largeness of our conjectural\r\ncorrection (18´´) shows that that part of the observation should be\r\nconsidered as nothing. The last contact was well enough observed, but\r\nit is on the forming and breaking of the annulus that I rely with entire\r\nconfidence. I am certain there was not an error of an instant of time in\r\neither. I would be governed, therefore, solely by them, and not suffer\r\ntheir result to be affected by the others. I have not yet entered on\r\nthe calculation of our longitude from them. They will enable you to do\r\nit as a college exercise. Affectionately yours.\r\n\r\n     First contact,    0h. 13´ 54´´\r\n     Annulus formed,   1h. 53´ 0´´ }central time of   }central time of\r\n     Annulus broken,   1h. 59´ 25´´}annulus,          }the two contacts,\r\n     Ultimate contact, 3h. 29´ 2´´   1h. 56´ 12½´       1h. 51´ 28´´\r\n     Latitude of\r\n     Monticello,         38° 8´\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DOCTOR ROBERT PATTERSON.\r\n\r\n                                             MONTICELLO, November 10, 1811.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of September 23d came to hand in due time, and I\r\nthank you for the nautical almanac it covered for the year 1813. I learn\r\nwith pleasure that the Philosophical Society has concluded to take into\r\nconsideration the subject of a fixed standard of measures, weights and\r\ncoins, and you ask my ideas on it; insulated as my situation is, I am\r\nsure I can offer nothing but what will occur to the committee engaged\r\non it, with the advantage on their part of correction by an interchange\r\nof sentiments and observations among themselves. I will, however, hazard\r\nsome general ideas because you desire it, and if a single one be useful,\r\nthe labor will not be lost.\r\n\r\nThe subject to be referred to as a standard, whether it be matter\r\nor motion, should be fixed by nature, invariable and accessible to\r\nall nations, independently of others, and with a convenience not\r\ndisproportioned to its utility. What subject in nature fulfils best these\r\nconditions? What system shall we propose on this, embracing measures,\r\nweights and coins? and in what form shall we present it to the world?\r\nThese are the questions before the committee.\r\n\r\nSome other subjects have, at different times, been proposed as\r\nstandards, but two only have divided the opinions of men: first, a\r\ndirect admeasurement of a line on the earth's surface, or second, a\r\nmeasure derived from its motion on its axis. To measure directly such\r\na portion of the earth as would furnish an element of measure, which\r\nmight be found again with certainty in all future times, would be too\r\nfar beyond the competence of our means to be taken into consideration.\r\nI am free, at the same time, to say that if these were within our power\r\nin the most ample degree, this element would not meet my preference.\r\nThe admeasurement would of course be of a portion of some great circle\r\nof the earth. If of the equator, the countries over which that passes,\r\ntheir character and remoteness, render the undertaking arduous, and\r\nwe may say impracticable for most nations. If of some meridian, the\r\nvarying measures of its degrees from the equator to the pole, require\r\na mean to be sought, of which some aliquot part may furnish what is\r\ndesired. For this purpose the 45th degree has been recurred to, and\r\nsuch a length of line on both sides of it terminating at each end in\r\nthe ocean, as may furnish a satisfactory law for a deduction of the\r\nunmeasured part of the quadrant. The portion resorted to by the French\r\nphilosophers, (and there is no other on the globe under circumstances\r\nequally satisfactory,) is the meridian passing through their country and\r\na portion of Spain, from Dunkirk to Barcelona. The objections to such\r\nan admeasurement as an element of measure, are the labor, the time, the\r\nnumber of highly-qualified agents, and the great expense required. All\r\nthis, too, is to be repeated whenever any accident shall have destroyed\r\nthe standard derived from it, or impaired its dimensions. This portion\r\nof that particular meridian is accessible of right to no one nation on\r\nearth. France, indeed, availing herself of a moment of peculiar relation\r\nbetween Spain and herself, has executed such an admeasurement. But how\r\nwould it be at this moment, as to either France or Spain? and how is it at\r\nall times as to other nations, in point either of right or of practice?\r\nMust these go through the same operation, or take their measures from\r\nthe standard prepared by France? Neither case bears that character of\r\nindependence which the problem requires, and which neither the equality\r\nnor convenience of nations can dispense with. How would it now be, were\r\nEngland the deposit of a standard for the world? At war with all the\r\nworld, the standard would be inaccessible to all other nations. Against\r\nthis, too, are the inaccuracies of admeasurements over hills and valleys,\r\nmountains and waters, inaccuracies often unobserved by the agent himself,\r\nand always unknown to the world. The various results of the different\r\nmeasures heretofore attempted, sufficiently prove the inadequacy of\r\nhuman means to make such an admeasurement with the exactness requisite.\r\n\r\nLet us now see under what circumstances the pendulum offers itself as an\r\nelement of measure. The motion of the earth on its axis from noon to noon\r\nof a mean solar day, has been divided from time immemorial, and by very\r\ngeneral consent, into 86,400 portions of time called seconds. The length\r\nof a pendulum vibrating in one of these portions, is determined by the\r\nlaws of nature, is invariable under the same parallel, and accessible\r\nindependently to all men. Like a degree of the meridian, indeed, it\r\nvaries in its length from the equator to the pole, and like it, too,\r\nrequires to be reduced to a mean. In seeking a mean in the first case,\r\nthe 45th degree occurs with unrivalled preferences. It is the mid-way\r\nof the celestial ark from the equator to the pole. It is a mean between\r\nthe two extreme degrees of the terrestrial ark, or between any two\r\nequi-distant from it, and it is also a mean value of all its degrees. In\r\nlike manner, when seeking a mean for the pendulum, the same 45th degree\r\noffers itself on the same grounds, its increments being governed by the\r\nsame laws which determine those of the different degrees of the meridian.\r\n\r\nIn a pendulum loaded with a Bob, some difficulty occurs in finding\r\nthe centre of oscillation; and consequently the distance between that\r\nand the point of suspension. To lessen this, it has been proposed to\r\nsubstitute for the pendulum, a cylindrical rod of small diameter, in\r\nwhich the displacement of the centre of oscillation would be lessened.\r\nIt has also been proposed to prolong the suspending wire of the pendulum\r\nbelow the Bob, until their centres of oscillation shall coincide. But\r\nthese propositions not appearing to have received general approbation,\r\nwe recur to the pendulum, suspended and charged as has been usual. And\r\nthe rather as the laws which determine the centre of oscillation leave\r\nno room for error in finding it, other than that minimum in practice to\r\nwhich all operations are subject in their execution. The other sources of\r\ninaccuracy in the length of the pendulum need not be mentioned, because\r\neasily guarded against. But the great and decisive superiority of the\r\npendulum, as a standard of measure, is in its accessibility to all men,\r\nat all times and in all places. To obtain the second pendulum for 45°\r\nit is not necessary to go actually to that latitude. Having ascertained\r\nits length in our own parallel, both theory and observation give us\r\na law for ascertaining the difference between that and the pendulum\r\nof any other. To make a new measure therefore, or verify an old one,\r\nnothing is necessary in any place but a well-regulated time-piece, or a\r\ngood meridian, and such a knowledge of the subject as is common in all\r\ncivilized nations.\r\n\r\nThose indeed who have preferred the other element, do justice to the\r\ncertainty, as well as superior facilities of the pendulum, by proposing\r\nto recur to one of the length of their standard, and to ascertain its\r\nnumber of vibrations in a day. These being once known, if any accident\r\nimpair their standard it is to be recovered by means of a pendulum\r\nwhich shall make the requisite number of vibrations in a day. And among\r\nthe several commissions established by the Academy of Sciences for the\r\nexecution of the several branches of their work on measures and weights,\r\nthat respecting the pendulum was assigned to Messrs. Borda, Coulomb &\r\nCassini, the result of whose labors, however, I have not learned.\r\n\r\nLet our unit of measures then be a pendulum of such length as in the\r\nlatitude of 45°, in the level of the ocean, and in a given temperature,\r\nshall perform its vibrations, in small and equal arcs, in one second of\r\nmean time.\r\n\r\nWhat ratio shall we adopt for the parts and multiples of this unit?\r\nThe decimal without a doubt. Our arithmetic being founded in a decimal\r\nnumeration, the same numeration in a system of measures, weights and\r\ncoins, tallies at once with that. On this question, I believe, there\r\nhas been no difference of opinion.\r\n\r\nIn measures of length, then, the pendulum is our unit. It is a little\r\nmore than our yard, and less than the ell. Its tenth or dime, will not\r\nbe quite 4 inches. Its hundredth, or cent, not quite .4 of an inch; its\r\nthousandth, or mill, not quite .04 of an inch, and so on. The traveller\r\nwill count his road by a longer measure. 1,000 units, or a kiliad, will\r\nnot be quite two-thirds of our present mile, and more nearly a thousand\r\npaces than that.\r\n\r\nFor measures of surface, the square unit, equal to about ten square feet,\r\nor one-ninth more than a square yard, will be generally convenient. But\r\nfor those of lands a larger measure will be wanted. A kiliad would be\r\nnot quite a rood, or quarter of an acre; a myriad not quite 2½ acres.\r\n\r\nFor measures of capacity, wet and dry,\r\n\r\n     The cubic Unit = .1 would be about .35 cubic feet, .28 bushels\r\n                      dry, or ⅞ of a ton liquid.\r\n               Dime = .1 would be about 3.5 cubic feet, 2.8 bushels,\r\n                      or about ⅞ of a barrel liquid.\r\n               Cent = .01 about 50 cubic inches, or ⅞ of a quart.\r\n               Mill = .001 = .5 of a cubic inch, or ⅔ of a gill.\r\n\r\nTo incorporate into the same system our weights and coins, we must recur\r\nto some natural substance, to be found everywhere, and of a composition\r\nsufficiently uniform. Water has been considered as the most eligible\r\nsubstance, and rain-water more nearly uniform than any other kind found\r\nin nature. That circumstance renders it preferable to distilled water,\r\nand its variations in weight may be called insensible.\r\n\r\nThe cubic unit of this = .1 would weigh about 2,165 lbs. or a ton between\r\nthe long and short.\r\n\r\n     The Dime            = .1 a little more than 2. kentals.\r\n         Cent            = .01 a little more than 20 lb.\r\n         Mill            = .001 a little more than 2 lb.\r\n         Decimmil        = .0001 about 3½ oz. avoirdupois.\r\n         Centimmil       = .00001 a little more than 6 dwt.\r\n         Millionth       = .000001 about 15 grains.\r\n         Decimmillionth  = .0000001 about 1½ grains.\r\n         Centimmillionth = .00000001 about .14 of a grain.\r\n         Billionth       = .000000001 about .014 of a grain.\r\n\r\nWith respect to our coins, the pure silver in a dollar being fixed by\r\nlaw at 347¼ grains, and all debts and contracts being bottomed on that\r\nvalue, we can only state the pure silver in the dollar, which would be\r\nvery nearly 23 millionths.\r\n\r\nI have used loose and round numbers (the exact unit being yet\r\nundetermined) merely to give a general idea of the measures and weights\r\nproposed, when compared with those we now use. And in the names of the\r\nsubdivisions I have followed the metrology of the ordinance of Congress\r\nof 1786, which for their series below unit adopted the Roman numerals.\r\nFor that above unit the Grecian is convenient, and has been adopted in\r\nthe new French system.\r\n\r\nWe come now to our last question, in what form shall we offer this\r\nmetrical system to the world? In some one which shall be altogether\r\nunassuming; which shall not have the appearance of taking the lead among\r\nour sister institutions in making a general proposition. So jealous is\r\nthe spirit of equality in the republic of letters, that the smallest\r\nexcitement of that would mar our views, however salutary for all.\r\nWe are in habits of correspondence with some of these institutions,\r\nand identity of character and of object, authorize our entering into\r\ncorrespondence with all. Let us then mature our system as far as can be\r\ndone at present, by ascertaining the length of the second pendulum of 45°\r\nby forming two tables, one of which shall give the equivalent of every\r\ndifferent denomination of measures, weights and coins in these States,\r\nin the unit of that pendulum, its decimals and multiples; and the other\r\nstating the equivalent of all the decimal parts and multiples of that\r\npendulum, in the several denominations of measures, weights and coins\r\nof our existing system. This done, we might communicate to one or more\r\nof these institutions in every civilized country a copy of those tables,\r\nstating as our motive, the difficulty we had experienced, and often the\r\nimpossibility of ascertaining the value of the measures, weights and\r\ncoins of other countries, expressed in any standard which we possess; that\r\ndesirous of being relieved from this, and of obtaining information which\r\ncould be relied on for the purposes of science, as well as of business,\r\nwe had concluded to ask it from the learned societies of other nations,\r\nwho are especially qualified to give it with the requisite accuracy; that\r\nin making this request we had thought it our duty first to do ourselves,\r\nand to offer to others, what we meant to ask from them, by stating the\r\nvalue of our own measures, weights and coins, in some unit of measure\r\nalready possessed, or easily obtainable, by all nations; that the pendulum\r\nvibrating seconds of mean time, presents itself as such an unit; its\r\nlength being determined by the laws of nature, and easily ascertainable\r\nat all times and places; that we have thought that of 45° would be the\r\nmost unexceptionable, as being a mean of all other parallels, and open\r\nto actual trial in both hemispheres. In this, therefore, as an unit,\r\nand in its parts and multiples in the decimal ratio, we have expressed,\r\nin the tables communicated, the value of all the measures, weights and\r\ncoins used in the United States, and we ask in return from their body\r\na table of the weights, measures and coins in use within their country,\r\nexpressed in the parts and multiples of the same unit. Having requested\r\nthe same favor from the learned societies of other nations, our object is,\r\nwith their assistance, to place within the reach of our fellow citizens\r\nat large a perfect knowledge of the measures, weights and coins of the\r\ncountries with which they have commercial or friendly intercourse; and\r\nshould the societies of other countries interchange their respective\r\ntables, the learned will be in possession of an uniform language in\r\nmeasures, weights and coins, which may with time become useful to other\r\ndescriptions of their citizens, and even to their governments. This,\r\nhowever, will rest with their pleasure, not presuming, in the present\r\nproposition, to extend our views beyond the limits of our own nation.\r\nI offer this sketch merely as the outline of the kind of communication\r\nwhich I should hope would excite no jealousy or repugnance.\r\n\r\nPeculiar circumstances, however, would require letters of a more special\r\ncharacter to the Institute of France, and the Royal Society of England.\r\nThe magnificent work which France has executed in the admeasurement of\r\nso large a portion of the meridian, has a claim to great respect in our\r\nreference to it. We should only ask a communication of their metrical\r\nsystem, expressed in equivalent values of the second pendulum of 45° as\r\nascertained by Messrs. Borda, Coulomb and Cassini, adding, perhaps, the\r\nrequest of an actual rod of the length of that pendulum.\r\n\r\nWith England, our explanations will be much more delicate. They are\r\nthe older country, the mother country, more advanced in the arts and\r\nsciences, possessing more wealth and leisure for their improvement,\r\nand animated by a pride more than laudable.[1] It is their measures,\r\ntoo, which we undertake to ascertain and communicate to themselves. The\r\nsubject should therefore be opened to them with infinite tenderness and\r\nrespect, and in some way which might give them due place in its agency.\r\nThe parallel of 45° being within our latitude and not within theirs, the\r\nactual experiments under that would be of course assignable to us. But\r\nas a corrective, I would propose that they should ascertain the length\r\nof the pendulum vibrating seconds in the city of London, or at the\r\nobservatory of Greenwich, while we should do the same in an equidistant\r\nparallel to the south of 45°, suppose in 38° 29´. We might ask of them,\r\ntoo, as they are in possession of the standards of Guildhall, of which\r\nwe can have but an unauthentic account, to make the actual application\r\nof those standards to the pendulum when ascertained. The operation we\r\nshould undertake under the 45th parallel, (about Passamaquoddy,) would\r\ngive us a happy occasion, too, of engaging our sister society of Boston in\r\nour views, by referring to them the execution of that part of the work.\r\nFor that of 38° 29´ we should be at a loss. It crosses the tide waters\r\nof the Potomac, about Dumfries, and I do not know what our resources\r\nthere would be unless we borrow them from Washington, where there are\r\ncompetent persons.\r\n\r\nAlthough I have not mentioned Philadelphia in these operations, I by no\r\nmeans propose to relinquish the benefit of observations to be made there.\r\nHer science and perfection in the arts would be a valuable corrective\r\nto the less perfect state of them in the other places of observation.\r\nIndeed, it is to be wished that Philadelphia could be made the point of\r\nobservation south of 45°, and that the Royal Society would undertake\r\nthe counterpoint on the north, which would be somewhere between the\r\nLizard and Falmouth. The actual pendulums from both of our points of\r\nobservation, and not merely the measures of them, should be delivered to\r\nthe Philosophical Society, to be measured under their eye and direction.\r\n\r\nAs this is really a work of common and equal interest to England and\r\nthe United States, perhaps it would be still more respectful to make our\r\nproposition to her Royal Society in the outset, and to agree with them\r\non a partition of the work. In this case, any commencement of actual\r\nexperiments on our part should be provisional only, and preparatory to\r\nthe ultimate results. We might, in the meantime, provisionally also, form\r\na table adapted to the length of the pendulum of 45°, according to the\r\nmost approved estimates, including those of the French commissioners. This\r\nwould serve to introduce the subject to the foreign societies, in the\r\nway before proposed, reserving to ourselves the charge of communicating\r\nto them a more perfect one, when that shall have been completed.\r\n\r\nWe may even go a step further, and make a general table of the measures,\r\nweights and coins of all nations, taking their value hypothetically\r\nfor the present, from the tables in the commercial dictionary of the\r\nencyclopedia methodique, which are very extensive, and have the appearance\r\nof being made with great labor and exactness. To these I expect we must\r\nin the end recur, as a supplement for the measures which we may fail\r\nto obtain from other countries directly. Their reference is to the foot\r\nor inch of Paris, as a standard, which we may convert into parts of the\r\nsecond pendulum of 45°.\r\n\r\nI have thus, my dear sir, committed to writing my general ideas on this\r\nsubject, the more freely as they are intended merely as suggestions for\r\nconsideration. It is not probable they offer anything which would not\r\nhave occurred to the committee itself. My apology on offering them must\r\nbe found in your request. My confidence in the committee, of which I\r\ntake for granted you are one, is too entire to have intruded a single\r\nidea but on that ground.\r\n\r\nBe assured of my affectionate and high esteem and respect.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n    [1] We are all occupied in industrious pursuits. They abound\r\n    with persons living on the industry of their fathers, or on the\r\n    earnings of their fellow citizens, given away by their rulers\r\n    in sinecures and pensions. Some of these, desirous of laudable\r\n    distinction, devote their time and means to the pursuits of\r\n    science, and become profitable members of society by an industry\r\n    of a higher order.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DOCTOR ROBERT PATTERSON.\r\n\r\n                                             MONTICELLO, November 10, 1811.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I write this letter separate, because you may perhaps think\r\nsomething in the other of the same date, worth communicating to the\r\ncommittee.\r\n\r\nI accept, willingly, Mr. Voigt's offer to make me a time-piece, and with\r\nthe kind of pendulum he proposes. I wish it to be as good as hands can\r\nmake it, in everything useful, but no unnecessary labor to be spent on\r\nmere ornament. A plain but neat mahogany case will be preferred.\r\n\r\nI have a curiosity to try the length of the pendulum vibrating seconds\r\nhere, and would wish Mr. Voigt to prepare one which could be substituted\r\nfor that of the clock occasionally, without requiring anything more than\r\nunhanging the one and hanging the other in its place. The bob should be\r\nspherical, of lead, and its radius, I presume, about one inch. As I should\r\nnot have the convenience of a room of uniform temperature, the suspending\r\nrod should be such as not to be affected by heat or cold, nor yet so heavy\r\nas to effect too sensibly the centre of oscillation. Would not a rod of\r\nwood not larger than a large wire, answer this double view? I remember\r\nMr. Rittenhouse told me he had made experiments on some occasion, on the\r\nexpansibility of wood lengthwise by heat, which satisfied him it was as\r\ngood as the gridiron for a suspender of the bob. By the experiments on\r\nthe strength of wood and iron in supporting weights appended to them,\r\niron has been found but about six times as strong as wood, while its\r\nspecific gravity is eight times as great. Consequently, a rod of it of\r\nequal strength, will weigh but three-fourths of one of iron, and disturb\r\nthe centre of oscillation less in proportion. A rod of wood of white oak,\r\ne. g. not larger than a seine twine, would probably support a spherical\r\nbob of lead of one inch radius. It might be worked down to that size\r\nI suppose, by the cabinet-makers, who are in the practice of preparing\r\nsmaller threads of wood for inlaying. The difficulty would be in making\r\nit fast to the bob at one end, and scapement at the other, so as to\r\nregulate the length with ease and accuracy. This Mr. Voigt's ingenuity\r\ncan supply, and in all things I would submit the whole matter to your\r\ndirection to him, and be thankful to you to give it. Yours affectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. H. A. S. DEARBORNE.\r\n\r\n                                             MONTICELLO, November 15, 1811.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your favor of October 14 was duly received, and with it Mr.\r\nBowditch's observations on the comet, for which I pray you to accept my\r\nthanks, and be so good as to present them to Mr. Bowditch also. I am much\r\npleased to find that we have so able a person engaged in observing the\r\npath of this great phenomenon; and hope that from his observations and\r\nthose of others of our philosophical citizens, on its orbit, we shall\r\nhave ascertained, on this side of the Atlantic, whether it be one of\r\nthose which have heretofore visited us. On the other side of the water\r\nthey have great advantages in their well-established observatories, the\r\nmagnificent instruments provided for them, and the leisure and information\r\nof their scientific men. The acquirements of Mr. Bowditch in solitude\r\nand unaided by these advantages, do him great honor.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the eclipse of September 17. I know of no observations\r\nmade in this State but my own, although I had no doubt that others had\r\nobserved it. I used myself an equatorial telescope, and was aided by a\r\nfriend who happened to be with me, and observed through an achromatic\r\ntelescope of Dollard's. Two others attended the time-pieces. I had a\r\nperfect observation of the passage of the sun over the meridian, and the\r\neclipse commencing but a few minutes after, left little room for error\r\nin our time. This little was corrected by the known rate of going of the\r\nclock. But we as good as lost the first appulse by a want of sufficiently\r\nearly attention to be at our places, and composed. I have no confidence,\r\ntherefore, by several seconds, in the time noted. The last oscillation\r\nof the two luminaries was better observed. Yet even there was a certain\r\nterm of uncertainty as to the precise moment at which the indenture on\r\nthe limb of the sun entirely vanished. It is therefore the forming of\r\nthe annulus, and its breaking, which alone possess my entire and complete\r\nconfidence. I am certain there was not an error of an instant of time in\r\nthe observation of either of them. Their result therefore should not be\r\nsuffered to be affected by either of the others. The four observations\r\nwere as follows:\r\n\r\n     The 1st. appulse, 0h. 13´ 54´´\r\n     Annulus formed, 1h. 53´ 0´´} central time of } central time of the\r\n     Annulus broken, 1h. 59´25´´} annulus         } two contacts\r\n     Last oscillation, 3h. 29´ 2´´   1h. 56´12½´´      1h. 51´28´´\r\n     Latitude of Monticello, 38° 8´\r\n\r\nI have thus given you, Sir, my observations, with a candid statement of\r\ntheir imperfections. If they can be of any use to Mr. Bowditch, it will\r\nbe more than was in view when they were made; and should I hear of any\r\nother observations made in this State, I shall not fail to procure and\r\nsend him a copy of them. Be so good as to present me affectionately to\r\nyour much-esteemed father, and to accept the tender of my respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MELATIAH NASH.\r\n\r\n                                             MONTICELLO, November 15, 1811.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I duly received your letter of October 24 on the publication of\r\nan Ephemeris. I have long thought it desirable that something of that\r\nkind should be published in the United States, holding a middle station\r\nbetween the nautical and the common popular almanacs. It would certainly\r\nbe acceptable to a numerous and respectable description of our fellow\r\ncitizens, who, without undertaking the higher astronomical operations,\r\nfor which the former is calculated, yet occasionally wish for information\r\nbeyond the scope of the common almanacs. What you propose to insert in\r\nyour Ephemeris is very well so far. But I think you might give it more\r\nof the character desired by the addition of some other articles, which\r\nwould not enlarge it more than a leaf or two. For instance, the equation\r\nof time is essential to the regulation of our clocks and watches, and\r\nwould only add a narrow column to your 2d page. The sun's declination\r\nis often desirable, and would add but another narrow column to the same\r\npage. This last would be the more useful as an element for obtaining the\r\nrising and setting of the sun, in every part of the United States; for\r\nyour Ephemeris will, I suppose, give it only for a particular parallel,\r\nas of New York, which would in a great measure restrain its circulation\r\nto that parallel. But the sun's declination would enable every one to\r\ncalculate sunrise for himself, with scarcely more trouble than taking it\r\nfrom an Almanac. If you would add at the end of the work a formula for\r\nthat calculation, as, for example, that for Delalande, § 1026, a little\r\naltered. Thus, to the Logarithmic tangent of the latitude (a constant\r\nnumber) add the Log. tangent of the sun's declination; taking 10 from\r\nthe Index, the remainder is the line of an arch which, turned into time\r\nand added to 6 hours, gives sunrise for the winter half and sunset for\r\nthe summer half of the year, to which may be added 3 lines only from\r\nthe table of refractions, § 1028, or, to save even this trouble, and\r\ngive the calculation ready made for every parallel, print a table of\r\nsemi-diurnal arches, ranging the latitudes from 35° to 45° in a line\r\nat top and the degrees of declination in a vertical line on the left,\r\nand stating, in the line of the declination, the semi-diurnal arch for\r\neach degree of latitude, so that every one knowing the latitude of his\r\nplace and the declination of the day, would find his sunrise or his\r\nsunset where their horizontal and vertical lines meet. This table is\r\nto be found in many astronomical books, as, for instance, in Wakeley's\r\nMariner's Compass Rectified, and more accurately in the Connoissance des\r\ntems, for 1788. It would not occupy more than two pages at the end of\r\nthe work, and would render it an almanac for every part of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nTo give novelty, and increase the appetite for continuing to buy your\r\nEphemeris annually, you might every year select some one or two useful\r\ntables which many would wish to possess and preserve. These are to be\r\nfound in the requisite tables, the Connoissance des tems for different\r\nyears, and many in Pike's arithmetic.\r\n\r\nI have given these hints because you requested my opinion. They may extend\r\nthe plan of your Ephemeris beyond your view, which will be sufficient\r\nreason for not regarding them. In any event I shall willingly become a\r\nsubscriber to it, if you should have any place of deposit for them in\r\nVirginia where the price can be paid. Accept the tender of my respects.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DOCTOR BENJAMIN RUSH.\r\n\r\n                                           POPLAR FOREST, December 5, 1811.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--While at Monticello I am so much engrossed by business or\r\nsociety, that I can only write on matters of strong urgency. Here I have\r\nleisure, as I have everywhere the disposition to think of my friends.\r\nI recur, therefore, to the subject of your kind letters relating to Mr.\r\nAdams and myself, which a late occurrence has again presented to me. I\r\ncommunicated to you the correspondence which had parted Mrs. Adams and\r\nmyself, in proof that I could not give friendship in exchange for such\r\nsentiments as she had recently taken up towards myself, and avowed and\r\nmaintained in her letters to me. Nothing but a total renunciation of\r\nthese could admit a reconciliation, and that could be cordial only in\r\nproportion as the return to ancient opinions was believed sincere. In\r\nthese jaundiced sentiments of hers I had associated Mr. Adams, knowing\r\nthe weight which her opinions had with him, and notwithstanding she\r\ndeclared in her letters that they were not communicated to him. A late\r\nincident has satisfied me that I wronged him as well as her, in not\r\nyielding entire confidence to this assurance on her part. Two of the Mr.\r\n* * * * *, my neighbors and friends, took a tour to the northward during\r\nthe last summer. In Boston they fell into company with Mr. Adams, and\r\nby his invitation passed a day with him at Braintree. He spoke out to\r\nthem everything which came uppermost, and as it occurred to his mind,\r\nwithout any reserve; and seemed most disposed to dwell on those things\r\nwhich happened during his own administration. He spoke of his _masters_,\r\nas he called his Heads of departments, as acting above his control,\r\nand often against his opinions. Among many other topics, he adverted to\r\nthe unprincipled licentiousness of the press against myself, adding, \"I\r\nalways loved Jefferson, and still love him.\"\r\n\r\nThis is enough for me. I only needed this knowledge to revive towards him\r\nall the affections of the most cordial moments of our lives. Changing a\r\nsingle word only in Dr. Franklin's character of him, I knew him to be\r\nalways an honest man, often a great one, but sometimes incorrect and\r\nprecipitate in his judgments; and it is known to those who have ever\r\nheard me speak of Mr. Adams, that I have ever done him justice myself,\r\nand defended him when assailed by others, with the single exception as\r\nto political opinions. But with a man possessing so many other estimable\r\nqualities, why should we be dissocialized by mere differences of opinion\r\nin politics, in religion, in philosophy, or anything else. His opinions\r\nare as honestly formed as my own. Our different views of the same subject\r\nare the result of a difference in our organization and experience. I\r\nnever withdrew from the society of any man on this account, although\r\nmany have done it from me; much less should I do it from one with whom\r\nI had gone through, with hand and heart, so many trying scenes. I wish,\r\ntherefore, but for an apposite occasion to express to Mr. Adams my\r\nunchanged affections for him. There is an awkwardness which hangs over\r\nthe resuming a correspondence so long discontinued, unless something\r\ncould arise which should call for a letter. Time and chance may perhaps\r\ngenerate such an occasion, of which I shall not be wanting in promptitude\r\nto avail myself. From this fusion of mutual affections, Mrs. Adams is\r\nof course separated. It will only be necessary that I never name her.\r\nIn your letters to Mr. Adams, you can, perhaps, suggest my continued\r\ncordiality towards him, and knowing this, should an occasion of writing\r\nfirst present itself to him, he will perhaps avail himself of it, as I\r\ncertainly will, should it first occur to me. No ground for jealousy now\r\nexisting, he will certainly give fair play to the natural warmth of his\r\nheart. Perhaps I may open the way in some letter to my old friend Gerry,\r\nwho I know is in habits of the greatest intimacy with him.\r\n\r\nI have thus, my friend, laid open my heart to you, because you were so\r\nkind as to take an interest in healing again revolutionary affections,\r\nwhich have ceased in expression only, but not in their existence. God\r\never bless you, and preserve you in life and health.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DOCTOR CRAWFORD.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, January 2, 1812.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your favor of December 17th, has been duly received, and with\r\nit the pamphlet on the cause, seat and cure of diseases, for which be\r\npleased to accept my thanks. The commencement which you propose by the\r\nnatural history of the diseases of the human body, is a very interesting\r\none, and will certainly be the best foundation for whatever relates to\r\ntheir cure. While surgery is seated in the temple of the exact sciences,\r\nmedicine has scarcely entered its threshold. Her theories have passed in\r\nsuch rapid succession as to prove the insufficiency of all, and their\r\nfatal errors are recorded in the necrology of man. For some forms of\r\ndisease, well known and well defined, she has found substances which will\r\nrestore order to the human system, and it is to be hoped that observation\r\nand experience will add to their number. But a great mass of diseases\r\nremain undistinguished and unknown, exposed to the random shot of the\r\ntheory of the day. If on this chaos you can throw such a beam of light\r\nas your celebrated brother has done on the sources of animal heat, you\r\nwill, like him, render great service to mankind.\r\n\r\nThe fate of England, I think with you, is nearly decided, and the\r\npresent form of her existence is drawing to a close. The ground, the\r\nhouses, the men will remain; but in what new form they will revive and\r\nstand among nations, is beyond the reach of human foresight. We hope\r\nit may be one of which the predatory principle may not be the essential\r\ncharacteristic. If her transformation shall replace her under the laws\r\nof moral order, it is for the general interest that she should still be\r\na sensible and independent weight in the scale of nations, and be able\r\nto contribute, when a favorable moment presents itself, to reduce under\r\nthe same order, her great rival in flagitiousness. We especially ought to\r\npray that the powers of Europe may be so poised and counterpoised among\r\nthemselves, that their own safety may require the presence of all their\r\nforce at home, leaving the other quarters of the globe in undisturbed\r\ntranquillity. When our strength will permit us to give the law of our\r\nhemisphere, it should be that the meridian of the mid-Atlantic should\r\nbe the line of demarkation between war and peace, on this side of which\r\nno act of hostility should be committed, and the lion and the lamb lie\r\ndown in peace together.\r\n\r\nI am particularly thankful for the kind expressions of your letter towards\r\nmyself, and tender you in return my best wishes and the assurances of\r\nmy great respect and esteem.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. THOMAS PULLY.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, January 8, 1812.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have duly received your favor of December 22d, informing me\r\nthat the society of artists of the United States had made me an honorary\r\nmember of their society. I am very justly sensible of the honor they have\r\ndone me, and I pray you to return them my thanks for this mark of their\r\ndistinction. I fear that I can be but a very useless associate. Time,\r\nwhich withers the fancy, as the other faculties of the mind and body,\r\npresses on me with a heavy hand, and distance intercepts all personal\r\nintercourse. I can offer, therefore, but my zealous good wishes for the\r\nsuccess of the institution, and that, embellishing with taste a country\r\nalready overflowing with the useful productions, it may be able to give an\r\ninnocent and pleasing direction to accumulations of wealth, which would\r\notherwise be employed in the nourishment of coarse and vicious habits.\r\nWith these I tender to the society and to yourself the assurances of my\r\nhigh respect and consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL MONROE.\r\n\r\n                                              MONTICELLO, January 11, 1812.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I thank you for your letter of the 6th. It is a proof of your\r\nfriendship, and of the sincere interest you take in whatever concerns\r\nme. Of this I have never had a moment's doubt, and have ever valued it\r\nas a precious treasure. The question indeed whether I knew or approved\r\nof General Wilkinson's endeavors to prevent the restoration of the\r\nright of deposit at New Orleans, could never require a second of time\r\nto answer. But it requires some time for the mind to recover from the\r\nastonishment excited by the boldness of the suggestion. Indeed, it is\r\nwith difficulty I can believe he has really made such an appeal; and\r\nthe rather as the expression in your letter is that you have \"casually\r\nheard it,\" without stating the degree of reliance which you have in the\r\nsource of information. I think his understanding is above an expedient\r\nso momentary and so finally overwhelming. Were Dearborne and myself dead,\r\nit might find credit with some. But the world at large, even then, would\r\nweigh for themselves the dilemma, whether it was more probable that, in\r\nthe situation I then was, clothed with the confidence and power of my\r\ncountry, I should descend to so unmeaning an act of treason, or that he,\r\nin the wreck now threatening him, should wildly lay hold of any plank.\r\nThey would weigh his motives and views against those of Dearborne and\r\nmyself, the tenor of his life against that of ours, his Spanish mysteries\r\nagainst my open cherishment of the Western interests; and, living as we\r\nare, and ready to purge ourselves by any ordeal, they must now weigh, in\r\naddition, our testimony against his. All this makes me believe he will\r\nnever seek this refuge. I have ever and carefully restrained myself from\r\nthe expression of any opinion respecting General Wilkinson, except in\r\nthe case of Burr's conspiracy, wherein, after he had got over his first\r\nagitations, we believed his decision firm, and his conduct zealous for\r\nthe defeat of the conspiracy, and although injudicious, yet meriting,\r\nfrom sound intentions, the support of the nation. As to the rest of his\r\nlife, I have left it to his friends and his enemies, to whom it furnishes\r\nmatter enough for disputation. I classed myself with neither, and least\r\nof all in this time of his distresses, should I be disposed to add to\r\ntheir pressure. I hope, therefore, he has not been so imprudent as to\r\nwrite our names in the pannel of his witnesses.\r\n\r\nAccept the assurances of my constant affections.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n                                              MONTICELLO, January 21, 1812.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I thank you before hand (for they are not yet arrived) for\r\nthe specimens of homespun you have been so kind as to forward me by\r\npost. I doubt not their excellence, knowing how far you are advanced in\r\nthese things in your quarter. Here we do little in the fine way, but in\r\ncoarse and middling goods a great deal. Every family in the country is\r\na manufactory within itself, and is very generally able to make within\r\nitself all the stouter and middling stuffs for its own clothing and\r\nhousehold use. We consider a sheep for every person in the family as\r\nsufficient to clothe it, in addition to the cotton, hemp and flax which\r\nwe raise ourselves. For fine stuff we shall depend on your northern\r\nmanufactories. Of these, that is to say, of company establishments, we\r\nhave none. We use little machinery. The spinning jenny, and loom with the\r\nflying shuttle, can be managed in a family; but nothing more complicated.\r\nThe economy and thriftiness resulting from our household manufactures are\r\nsuch that they will never again be laid aside; and nothing more salutary\r\nfor us has ever happened than the British obstructions to our demands\r\nfor their manufactures. Restore free intercourse when they will, their\r\ncommerce with us will have totally changed its form, and the articles\r\nwe shall in future want from them will not exceed their own consumption\r\nof our produce.\r\n\r\nA letter from you calls up recollections very dear to my mind. It carries\r\nme back to the times when, beset with difficulties and dangers, we were\r\nfellow-laborers in the same cause, struggling for what is most valuable\r\nto man, his right of self-government. Laboring always at the same oar,\r\nwith some wave ever ahead, threatening to overwhelm us, and yet passing\r\nharmless under our bark, we knew not how we rode through the storm\r\nwith heart and hand, and made a happy port. Still we did not expect\r\nto be without rubs and difficulties; and we have had them. First, the\r\ndetention of the western posts, then the coalition of Pilnitz, outlawing\r\nour commerce with France, and the British enforcement of the outlawry.\r\nIn your day, French depredations; in mine, English, and the Berlin and\r\nMilan decrees; now, the English orders of council, and the piracies they\r\nauthorize. When these shall be over, it will be the impressment of our\r\nseamen or something else; and so we have gone on, and so we shall go\r\non, puzzled and prospering beyond example in the history of man. And I\r\ndo believe we shall continue to growl, to multiply and prosper until we\r\nexhibit an association, powerful, wise and happy, beyond what has yet\r\nbeen seen by men. As for France and England, with all their preëminence\r\nin science, the one is a den of robbers, and the other of pirates.\r\nAnd if science produces no better fruits than tyranny, murder, rapine\r\nand destitution of national morality, I would rather wish our country\r\nto be ignorant, honest and estimable, as our neighboring savages are.\r\nBut whither is senile garrulity leading me? Into politics, of which\r\nI have taken final leave. I think little of them and say less. I have\r\ngiven up newspapers in exchange for Tacitus and Thucydides, for Newton\r\nand Euclid, and I find myself much the happier. Sometimes, indeed,\r\nI look back to former occurrences, in remembrance of our old friends\r\nand fellow-laborers, who have fallen before us. Of the signers of the\r\nDeclaration of Independence, I see now living not more than half a dozen\r\non your side of the Potomac, and on this side, myself alone. You and I\r\nhave been wonderfully spared, and myself with remarkable health, and a\r\nconsiderable activity of body and mind. I am on horseback three or four\r\nhours of every day; visit three or four times a year a possession I\r\nhave ninety miles distant, performing the winter journey on horseback.\r\nI walk little, however, a single mile being too much for me, and I live\r\nin the midst of my grand children, one of whom has lately promoted me\r\nto be a great grandfather. I have heard with pleasure that you also\r\nretain good health, and a greater power of exercise in walking than I\r\ndo. But I would rather have heard this from yourself, and that, writing\r\na letter like mine, full of egotisms, and of details of your health,\r\nyour habits, occupations and enjoyments, I should have the pleasure\r\nof knowing that in the race of life, you do not keep, in its physical\r\ndecline, the same distance ahead of me which you have done in political\r\nhonors and achievements. No circumstances have lessened the interest I\r\nfeel in these particulars respecting yourself; none have suspended for\r\none moment my sincere esteem for you, and I now salute you with unchanged\r\naffection and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GOVERNOR BARBOUR.\r\n\r\n                                              MONTICELLO, January 22, 1812.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of the 14th has been duly received, and I sincerely\r\ncongratulate you, or rather my country, on the just testimony of\r\nconfidence which it has lately manifested to you. In your hands I know\r\nthat its affairs will be ably and honestly administered.\r\n\r\nIn answer to your inquiry whether, in the early times of our government,\r\nwhere the council was divided, the practice was for the Governor to give\r\nthe deciding vote? I must observe that, correctly speaking, the Governor\r\nnot being a counsellor, his vote could make no part of an advice of\r\ncouncil. That would be to place an advice on their journals which they\r\ndid not give, and could not give because of their equal division. But\r\nhe did what was equivalent in effect. While I was in the administration,\r\nno doubt was ever suggested that where the council, divided in opinion,\r\ncould give no advice, the Governor was free and bound to act on his\r\nown opinion and his own responsibility. Had this been a change of the\r\npractice of my predecessor, Mr. Henry, the first governor, it would have\r\nproduced some discussion, which it never did. Hence, I conclude it was\r\nthe opinion and practice from the first institution of the government.\r\nDuring Arnold's and Cornwallis' invasion, the council dispersed to their\r\nseveral homes, to take care of their families. Before their separation,\r\nI obtained from them a capitulary of standing advices for my government\r\nin such cases as ordinarily occur: such as the appointment of militia\r\nofficers, justices, inspectors, &c., on the recommendations of the\r\ncourts; but in the numerous and extraordinary occurrences of an invasion,\r\nwhich could not be foreseen, I had to act on my own judgment and my\r\nown responsibility. The vote of general approbation, at the session\r\nof the succeeding winter, manifested the opinion of the Legislature,\r\nthat my proceedings had been correct. General Nelson, my successor,\r\nstaid mostly, I think, with the army; and I do not believe his council\r\nfollowed the camp, although my memory does not enable me to affirm the\r\nfact. Some petitions against him for impressment of property without\r\nauthority of law, brought his proceedings before the next Legislature;\r\nthe questions necessarily involved were whether necessity, without\r\nexpress law, could justify the impressment, and if it could, whether he\r\ncould order it without the advice of council. The approbation of the\r\nLegislature amounted to a decision of both questions. I remember this\r\ncase the more especially, because I was then a member of the Legislature,\r\nand was one of those who supported the Governor's proceedings, and I\r\nthink there was no division of the House on the question. I believe the\r\ndoubt was first suggested in Governor Harrison's time, by some member of\r\nthe council, on an equal division. Harrison, in his dry way, observed\r\nthat instead of one governor and eight counsellors, there would then\r\nbe eight governors and one counsellor, and continued, as I understood,\r\nthe practice of his predecessors. Indeed, it is difficult to suppose it\r\ncould be the intention of those who framed the constitution, that when\r\nthe council should be divided the government should stand still; and\r\nthe more difficult as to a constitution formed during a war, and for\r\nthe purpose of carrying on that war, that so high an officer as their\r\nGovernor should be created and salaried, merely to act as the clerk and\r\nauthenticator of the votes of the council. No doubt it was intended that\r\nthe advice of the council should control the governor. But the action of\r\nthe controlling power being withdrawn, his would be left free to proceed\r\non its own responsibility. Where from division, absence, sickness or\r\nother obstacle, no advice could be given, they could not mean that their\r\nGovernor, the person of their peculiar choice and confidence, should stand\r\nby, an inactive spectator, and let their government tumble to pieces for\r\nwant of a will to direct it. In executive cases, where promptitude and\r\ndecision are all important, an adherence to the letter of a law against\r\nits probable intentions, (for every law must intend that itself shall be\r\nexecuted,) would be fraught with incalculable danger. Judges may await\r\nfurther legislative explanations, but a delay of executive action might\r\nproduce irretrievable ruin. The State is invaded, militia to be called\r\nout, an army marched, arms and provisions to be issued from the public\r\nmagazines, the Legislature to be convened, and the council is divided.\r\nCan it be believed to have been the intention of the framers of the\r\nconstitution, that the constitution itself and their constituents with\r\nit should be destroyed for want of a will to direct the resources they\r\nhad provided for its preservation? Before such possible consequences\r\nall verbal scruples must vanish; construction must be made _secundum\r\narbitrium boni viri_, and the constitution be rendered a practicable\r\nthing. That exposition of it must be vicious, which would leave the\r\nnation under the most dangerous emergencies without a directing will.\r\nThe cautious maxims of the bench, to seek the will of the legislator and\r\nhis words only, are proper and safer for judicial government. They act\r\never on an individual case only, the evil of which is partial, and gives\r\ntime for correction. But an instant of delay in executive proceedings\r\nmay be fatal to the whole nation. They must not, therefore, be laced up\r\nin the rules of the judiciary department. They must seek the intention\r\nof the legislator in all the circumstances which may indicate it in the\r\nhistory of the day, in the public discussions, in the general opinion and\r\nunderstanding, in reason and in practice. The three great departments\r\nhaving distinct functions to perform, must have distinct rules adapted\r\nto them. Each must act under its own rules, those of no one having\r\nany obligation on either of the others. When the opinion first begun\r\nthat a governor could not act when his council could not or would not\r\nadvise, I am uninformed. Probably not till after the war; for, had it\r\nprevailed then, no militia could have been opposed to Cornwallis, nor\r\nnecessaries furnished to the opposing army of Lafayette. These, Sir, are\r\nmy recollections and thoughts on the subject of your inquiry, to which\r\nI will only add the assurances of my great esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO BENJAMIN GALLOWAY, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                              MONTICELLO, February 2, 1812.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I duly received your favor of the 1st inst., together with the\r\nvolume accompanying it, for which I pray you to accept my thanks, and\r\nto be so kind as to convey them to Mrs. Debutts also, to whose obliging\r\ncare I am indebted for its transmission. But especially my thanks are\r\ndue to the author himself for the honorable mention he has made of me.\r\nWith the exception of two or three characters of greater eminence in the\r\nrevolution, we formed a group of fellow laborers in the common cause,\r\nanimated by a common zeal, and claiming no distinction of one over\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of freedom, breathed through the whole of Mr. Northmore's\r\ncomposition, is really worthy of the purest times of Greece and Rome. It\r\nwould have been received in England, in the days of Hampden and Sidney,\r\nwith more favor than at this time. It marks a high and independent mind\r\nin the author, one capable of rising above the partialities of country,\r\nto have seen in the adversary cause that of justice and freedom, and to\r\nhave estimated fairly the motives and actions of those engaged in its\r\nsupport. I hope and firmly believe that the whole world will, sooner\r\nlater, feel benefit from the issue of our assertion of the rights of man.\r\nAlthough the horrors of the French revolution have damped for awhile the\r\nardor of the patriots in every country, yet it is not extinguished--it\r\nwill never die. The sense of right has been excited in every breast, and\r\nthe spark will be rekindled by the very oppressions of that detestable\r\ntyranny employed to quench it. The errors of the honest patriots of\r\nFrance, and the crimes of her Dantons and Robespierres, will be forgotten\r\nin the more encouraging contemplation of our sober example, and steady\r\nmarch to our object. Hope will strengthen the presumption that what has\r\nbeen done once may be done again. As you have been the channel of my\r\nreceiving this mark of attention from Mr. Northmore, I must pray you\r\nto be that of conveying to him my thanks, and an assurance of the high\r\nsense I have of the merit of his work, and of its tendency to cherish\r\nthe noblest virtues of the human character.\r\n\r\nOn the political events of the day I have nothing to communicate. I have\r\nretired from them, and given up newspapers for more classical reading.\r\nI add, therefore, only the assurances of my great esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. EZRA SARGEANT.\r\n\r\n                                              MONTICELLO, February 3, 1812.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Observing that you edit the Edinburgh Review, reprinted in New\r\nYork, and presuming that your occupations in that line are not confined\r\nto that single work, I take the liberty of addressing the present letter\r\nto you. If I am mistaken, the obviousness of the inference will be my\r\napology. Mr. Edward Livingston brought an action against me for having\r\nremoved his intrusion on the beach of the river Mississippi opposite\r\nto New Orleans. At the request of my counsel I made a statement of the\r\nfacts of the case, and of the law applicable to them, so as to form a\r\nfull argument of justification. The case has been dismissed from court\r\nfor want of jurisdiction, and the public remain uninformed whether I\r\nhad really abused the powers entrusted to me, as he alleged. I wish\r\nto convey to them this information by publishing the justification.\r\nThe questions arising in the case are mostly under the civil law, the\r\nlaws of Spain and of France, which are of course couched in French, in\r\nSpanish, in Latin, and some in Greek; and the books being in few hands\r\nin this country, I was obliged to make very long extracts from them. The\r\ncorrectness with which your edition of the Edinburgh Review is printed,\r\nand of the passages quoted in those languages, induces me to propose to\r\nyou the publication of the case I speak of. It will fill about 65 or 70\r\npages of the type and size of paper of the Edinburgh Review. The MS. is\r\nin the handwriting of this letter, entirely fair and correct. It will\r\ntake between four and five sheets of paper, of sixteen pages each. I\r\nshould want 250 copies struck off for myself, intended principally for\r\nthe members of Congress, and the printer would be at liberty to print\r\nas many more as he pleased for sale, but without any copyright, which\r\nI should not propose to have taken out. It is right that I should add,\r\nthat the work is not at all for popular reading. It is merely a law\r\nargument, and a very dry one; having been intended merely for the eye of\r\nmy counsel. It may be in some demand perhaps with lawyers, and persons\r\nengaged in the public affairs, but very little beyond that. Will you\r\nbe so good as to inform me if you will undertake to edit this, and what\r\nwould be the terms on which you can furnish me with 250 copies? I should\r\nwant it to be done with as little delay as possible, so that Congress\r\nmight receive it before they separate; and I should add as a condition,\r\nthat not a copy should be sold until I could receive my number, and have\r\ntime to lay them on the desks of the members. This would require a month\r\nfrom the time they should leave New York by the stage. In hopes of an\r\nearly answer I tender you the assurances of my respect.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                             MONTICELLO, February 14, 1812.\r\n\r\nThomas Jefferson presents his compliments to Dr. Wheaton, and his thanks\r\nfor the address he was so kind as to enclose him on the advancement in\r\nMedicine. Having little confidence in the theories of that art, which\r\nchange in their fashion with the ladies' caps and gowns, he has much in\r\nthe facts it has established by observation. The experience of physicians\r\nhas proved that in certain forms of disease, certain substances will\r\nrestore order to the human system; and he doubts not that continued\r\nobservation will enlarge the catalogue, and give relief to our posterity\r\nin cases wherein we are without it. The extirpation of the small pox\r\nby vaccination, is an encouraging proof that the condition of man is\r\nsusceptible of amelioration, although we are not able to fix its extent.\r\nHe salutes Dr. Wheaton with esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. CHARLES CHRISTIAN.\r\n\r\n                                                MONTICELLO, March 21, 1812.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have duly received your favor of the 10th inst. proposing to\r\nme to join in a contribution for the support of the family of the late\r\nMr. Cheetham of New York. Private charities, as well as contributions\r\nto public purposes in proportion to every one's circumstances, are\r\ncertainly among the duties we owe to society, and I have never felt a\r\nwish to withdraw from my portion of them. The general relation in which\r\nI, some time since, stood to the citizens of all our States, drew on me\r\nsuch multitudes of these applications as exceeded all resource. Nor have\r\nthey much abated since my retirement to the limited duties of a private\r\ncitizen, and the more limited resources of a private fortune. They have\r\nobliged me to lay down as a law of conduct for myself, to restrain my\r\ncontributions for public institutions to the circle of my own State,\r\nand for private charities to that which is under my own observation;\r\nand these calls I find more than sufficient for everything I can spare.\r\nNor was there anything in the case of the late Mr. Cheetham, which could\r\nclaim with me to be taken out of a general rule. On these considerations\r\nI must decline the contribution you propose, not doubting that the\r\nefforts of the family, aided by those who stand in the relation to them\r\nof neighbors and friends, in so great a mart for industry as they are\r\nplaced in, will save them from all danger of want or suffering. With\r\nthis apology for returning the paper sent me, unsubscribed, be pleased\r\nto accept the tender of my respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. VANDER KEMP.\r\n\r\n                                                MONTICELLO, March 22, 1812.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I am indebted to you for the communication of the prospectus of\r\na work embracing the history of civilized man, political and moral,\r\nfrom the great change produced in his condition by the extension of\r\nthe feudal system over Europe through all the successive effects of the\r\nrevival of letters, the invention of printing, that of the compass, the\r\nenlargement of science, and the revolutionary spirit, religious and civil,\r\ngenerated by that. It presents a vast anatomy of fact and reflection,\r\nwhich if duly filled up would offer to the human mind a wonderful mass\r\nfor contemplation.\r\n\r\nYour letter does not ascertain whether this work is already executed,\r\nor only meditated; but it excites a great desire to see it completed,\r\nand a confidence that the author of the analysis is best able to develop\r\nthe profound views there only sketched. It would be a library in itself,\r\nand to our country particularly desirable and valuable, if executed in\r\nthe genuine republican principles of our constitution. The only orthodox\r\nobject of the institution of government is to secure the greatest\r\ndegree of happiness possible to the general mass of those associated\r\nunder it. The events which this work proposes to embrace will establish\r\nthe fact that unless the mass retains sufficient control over those\r\nintrusted with the powers of their government, these will be perverted\r\nto their own oppression, and to the perpetuation of wealth and power in\r\nthe individuals and their families selected for the trust. Whether our\r\nconstitution has hit on the exact degree of control necessary, is yet\r\nunder experiment; and it is a most encouraging reflection that distance\r\nand other difficulties securing us against the brigand governments of\r\nEurope, in the safe enjoyment of our farms and firesides, the experiment\r\nstands a better chance of being satisfactorily made here than on any\r\noccasion yet presented by history. To promote, therefore, unanimity and\r\nperseverance in this great enterprise, to disdain despair, encourage\r\ntrial, and nourish hope, are the worthiest objects of every political\r\nand philanthropic work; and that this would be the necessary result\r\nof that which you have delineated, the facts it will review, and the\r\njust reflections arising out of them, will sufficiently answer. I hope,\r\ntherefore, that it is not _in petto_ merely, but already completed; and\r\nthat my fellow citizens, warned in it of the rocks and shoals on which\r\nother political associations have been wrecked, will be able to direct\r\ntheirs with a better knowledge of the dangers in its way.\r\n\r\nThe enlargement of your observations on the subjects of natural history,\r\nalluded to in your letter, cannot fail to add to our lights respecting\r\nthem, and will therefore ever be a welcome present to every friend of\r\nscience. Accept, I pray you, the assurance of my great esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE HONORABLE MR. NELSON.\r\n\r\n                                                MONTICELLO, April 2d, 1812.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your letter of March 22d has been duly received. By this time\r\na printed copy of my MS. respecting the Batture has I hope been laid\r\non your desk, by which you will perceive that the MS. itself has been\r\nreceived long enough to have been sent to New York, printed and returned\r\nto Washington.\r\n\r\nOn the subject of the omission of the officers of the Virginia State\r\nline, in the provisions and reservations of the cession of Congress,\r\nmy memory enables me to say nothing more than that it was not through\r\ninattention, as I believe, but the result of compromise. But of this\r\nthe President, who was in Congress when the arrangement was settled, can\r\ngive the best account. I had nothing to do but execute a deed according\r\nto that arrangement, made previous to my being a member. Colonel Monroe\r\nbeing a member with me, is more likely to remember what passed at that\r\ntime; but the best resource for explanation of everything we did, is in\r\nour weekly correspondence with the Governor of Virginia, which I suppose\r\nis still among the Executive records. We made it a point to write a\r\nletter to him every week, either jointly, or individually by turns.\r\n\r\nYou request me to state the public sentiment of our part of the country\r\nas to war and the taxes. You know I do not go out much. My own house\r\nand our court yard are the only places where I see my fellow citizens.\r\nAs far as I can judge in this limited sphere, I think all regret that\r\nthere is cause for war, but all consider it as now necessary, and would,\r\nI think, disapprove of a much longer delay of the declaration of it.\r\nAs to the taxes, they expect to meet them, would be unwilling to have\r\nthem postponed, and are only dissatisfied with some of the subjects of\r\ntaxation; that is to say the stamp tax and excise. To the former I have\r\nnot seen a man who is not totally irreconcilable. If the latter could be\r\ncollected from those who buy to sell again, so as to prevent domiciliary\r\nvisits by the officers, I think it would be acceptable, and I am sure a\r\nwholesome tax. I am persuaded the Secretary of the Treasury is mistaken\r\nin supposing so immense a deduction from the duties on imports. We shall\r\nmake little less to sell than we do now, for no one will let his hands\r\nbe idle; and consequently we shall export not much less, and expect\r\nreturns. Some part will be taken on the export and some on the import.\r\nBut taking into account the advance of prices, that revenue will not\r\nfall so far short as he thinks; and I have no doubt might be counted\r\non to make good the entire suppression of the stamp tax. Yet, although\r\na very disgusting pill, I think there can be no question the people\r\nwill swallow it, if their representatives determine on it. I get their\r\nsentiments mostly from those who are most in the habit of intercourse\r\nwith the people than I am myself. Accept the assurance of my great esteem\r\nand respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n                                                MONTICELLO, April 17, 1812.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--The enclosed papers will explain themselves. Their coming to\r\nme is the only thing not sufficiently explained.\r\n\r\nYour favor of the 3d came duly to hand. Although something of the kind\r\nhad been apprehended, the embargo found the farmers and planters only\r\ngetting their produce to market, and selling as fast as they could get it\r\nthere. I think it caught them in this part of the State with one-third of\r\ntheir flour or wheat and three-quarters of their tobacco undisposed of.\r\nIf we may suppose the rest of the middle country in the same situation,\r\nand that the upper and lower country may be judged by that as a mean,\r\nthese will perhaps be the proportions of produce remaining in the hands\r\nof the producers. Supposing the objects of the government were merely to\r\nkeep our vessels and men out of harm's way, and that there is no idea\r\nthat the want of our flour will starve Great Britain, the sale of the\r\nremaining produce will be rather desirable, and what would be desired\r\neven in war, and even to our enemies. For I am favorable to the opinion\r\nwhich has been urged by others, sometimes acted on, and now partly so by\r\nFrance and Great Britain, that commerce, under certain restrictions and\r\nlicenses, may be indulged between enemies mutually advantageous to the\r\nindividuals, and not to their injury as belligerents. The capitulation\r\nof Amelia Island, if confirmed, might favor this object, and at any rate\r\nget off our produce now on hand. I think a people would go through a\r\nwar with much less impatience if they could dispose of their produce,\r\nand that unless a vent can be provided for them, they will soon become\r\nquerulous and clamor for peace. They appear at present to receive the\r\nembargo with perfect acquiescence and without a murmur, seeing the\r\nnecessity of taking care of our vessels and seamen. Yet they would be\r\nglad to dispose of their produce in any way not endangering them, as by\r\nletting it go from a neutral place in British vessels. In this way we\r\nlose the carriage only; but better that than both carriage and cargo.\r\nThe rising of the price of flour, since the first panic is passed away,\r\nindicates some prospects in the merchants of disposing of it. Our wheat\r\nhad greatly suffered by the winter, but is as remarkably recovered by\r\nthe favorable weather of the spring. Ever affectionately yours.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n                                                MONTICELLO, April 20, 1812.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have it now in my power to send you a piece of homespun in\r\nreturn for that I received from you. Not of the fine texture, or delicate\r\ncharacter of yours, or, to drop our metaphor, not filled as that was\r\nwith that display of imagination which constitutes excellence in Belles\r\nLettres, but a mere sober, dry and formal piece of logic. _Ornari res\r\nipsa negat._ Yet you may have enough left of your old taste for law\r\nreading, to cast an eye over some of the questions it discusses. At any\r\nrate, accept it as the offering of esteem and friendship.\r\n\r\nYou wish to know something of the Richmond and Wabash prophets. Of Nimrod\r\nHews I never heard before. Christopher Macpherson I have known for twenty\r\nyears. He is a man of color, brought up as a book-keeper by a merchant,\r\nhis master, and afterwards enfranchized. He had understanding enough to\r\npost up his ledger from his journal, but not enough to bear up against\r\nhypochondriac affections, and the gloomy forebodings they inspire. He\r\nbecame crazy, foggy, his head always in the clouds, and rhapsodizing\r\nwhat neither himself nor any one else could understand. I think he told\r\nme he had visited you personally while you were in the administration,\r\nand wrote you letters, which you have probably forgotten in the mass\r\nof the correspondences of that crazy class, of whose complaints, and\r\nterrors, and mysticisms, the several Presidents have been the regular\r\ndepositories. Macpherson was too honest to be molested by anybody, and\r\ntoo inoffensive to be a subject for the mad-house; although, I believe,\r\nwe are told in the old book, that \"every man that is mad, and maketh\r\nhimself a prophet, thou shouldst put him in prison and in the stocks.\"\r\n\r\nThe Wabash prophet is a very different character, more rogue than fool,\r\nif to be a rogue is not the greatest of all follies. He arose to notice\r\nwhile I was in the administration, and became, of course, a proper subject\r\nof inquiry for me. The inquiry was made with diligence. His declared\r\nobject was the reformation of his red brethren, and their return to their\r\npristine manner of living. He pretended to be in constant communication\r\nwith the Great Spirit; that he was instructed by him to make known to\r\nthe Indians that they were created by him distinct from the whites, of\r\ndifferent natures, for different purposes, and placed under different\r\ncircumstances, adapted to their nature and destinies; that they must\r\nreturn from all the ways of the whites to the habits and opinions of\r\ntheir forefathers; they must not eat the flesh of hogs, of bullocks,\r\nof sheep, &c., the deer and buffalo having been created for their food;\r\nthey must not make bread of wheat but of Indian corn; they must not wear\r\nlinen nor woollen, but dress like their fathers in the skins and furs\r\nof animals; they must not drink ardent spirits, and I do not remember\r\nwhether he extended his inhibitions to the gun and gunpowder, in favor of\r\nthe bow and arrow. I concluded from all this, that he was a visionary,\r\nenveloped in the clouds of their antiquities, and vainly endeavoring to\r\nlead back his brethren to the fancied beatitudes of their golden age. I\r\nthought there was little danger of his making many proselytes from the\r\nhabits and comfort they had learned from the whites, to the hardships\r\nand privations of savagism, and no great harm if he did. We let him go\r\non, therefore, unmolested. But his followers increased till the English\r\nthought him worth corruption and found him corruptible. I suppose his\r\nviews were then changed; but his proceedings in consequence of them were\r\nafter I left the administration, and are, therefore, unknown to me; nor\r\nhave I ever been informed what were the particular acts on his part,\r\nwhich produced an actual commencement of hostilities on ours. I have\r\nno doubt, however, that his subsequent proceedings are but a chapter\r\napart, like that of Henry and Lord Liverpool, in the book of the kings\r\nof England.\r\n\r\nOf this mission of Henry, your son had got wind in the time of the\r\nembargo, and communicated it to me. But he had learned nothing of the\r\nparticular agent, although, of his workings, the information he had\r\nobtained appears now to have been correct. He stated a particular which\r\nHenry has not distinctly brought forward, which was that the Eastern\r\nStates were not to be required to make a formal act of separation from\r\nthe Union, and to take a part in the war against it; a measure deemed\r\nmuch too strong for their people; but to declare themselves in a state of\r\nneutrality, in consideration of which they were to have peace and free\r\ncommerce, the lure most likely to insure popular acquiescence. Having\r\nno indications of Henry as the intermediate in this negotiation of the\r\nEssex junto, suspicions fell on Pickering, and his nephew Williams, in\r\nLondon. If he was wronged in this, the ground of the suspicion is to\r\nbe found in his known practices and avowed opinions, as that of his\r\naccomplices in the sameness of sentiment and of language with Henry,\r\nand subsequently by the fluttering of the wounded pigeons.\r\n\r\nThis letter, with what it encloses, has given you enough, I presume, of\r\nlaw and the prophets. I will only add to it, therefore, the homage of my\r\nrespects to Mrs. Adams, and to yourself the assurances of affectionate\r\nesteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MAURY.\r\n\r\n                                                MONTICELLO, April 25, 1812.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR AND ANCIENT FRIEND AND CLASSMATE,--Often has my heart smote me\r\nfor delaying acknowledgments to you, receiving, as I do, such frequent\r\nproofs of your kind recollection in the transmission of papers to me. But\r\ninstead of acting on the good old maxim of not putting off to to-morrow\r\nwhat we can do to-day, we are too apt to reverse it, and not to do to-day\r\nwhat we can put off to-morrow. But this duty can be no longer put off.\r\nTo-day we are at peace; to-morrow, war. The curtain of separation is\r\ndrawing between us, and probably will not be withdrawn till one, if not\r\nboth of us, will be at rest with our fathers. Let me now, then, while\r\nI may, renew to you the declarations of my warm attachment, which in no\r\nperiod of life has ever been weakened, and seems to become stronger as\r\nthe remaining objects of our youthful affections are fewer.\r\n\r\nOur two countries are to be at war, but not you and I. And why should\r\nour two countries be at war, when by peace we can be so much more useful\r\nto one another? Surely the world will acquit our government from having\r\nsought it. Never before has there been an instance of a nation's bearing\r\nso much as we have borne. Two items alone in our catalogue of wrongs\r\nwill forever acquit us of being the aggressors: the impressment of our\r\nseamen, and the excluding us from the ocean. The first foundations of\r\nthe social compact would be broken up, were we definitively to refuse\r\nto its members the protection of their persons and property, while in\r\ntheir lawful pursuits. I think the war will not be short, because the\r\nobject of England, long obvious, is to claim the ocean as her domain,\r\nand to exact transit duties from every vessel traversing it. This is\r\nthe sum of her orders of council, which were only a step in this bold\r\nexperiment, never meant to be retracted if it could be permanently\r\nmaintained. And this object must continue her in war with all the world.\r\nTo this I see no termination, until her exaggerated efforts, so much\r\nbeyond her natural strength and resources, shall have exhausted her\r\nto bankruptcy. The approach of this crisis is, I think, visible in the\r\ndeparture of her precious metals, and depreciation of her paper medium.\r\nWe, who have gone through that operation, know its symptoms, its course,\r\nand consequences. In England they will be more serious than elsewhere,\r\nbecause half the wealth of her people is now in that medium, the private\r\nrevenue of her money-holders, or rather of her paper-holders, being,\r\nI believe, greater than that of her land-holders. Such a proportion of\r\nproperty, imaginary and baseless as it is, cannot be reduced to vapor\r\nbut with great explosion. She will rise out of its ruins, however,\r\nbecause her lands, her houses, her arts will remain, and the greater\r\npart of her men. And these will give her again that place among nations\r\nwhich is proportioned to her natural means, and which we all wish her\r\nto hold. We believe that the just standing of all nations is the health\r\nand security of all. We consider the overwhelming power of England on\r\nthe ocean, and of France on the land, as destructive of the prosperity\r\nand happiness of the world, and wish both to be reduced only to the\r\nnecessity of observing moral duties. We believe no more in Bonaparte's\r\nfighting merely for the liberty of the seas, than in Great Britain's\r\nfighting for the liberties of mankind. The object of both is the same,\r\nto draw to themselves the power, the wealth and the resources of other\r\nnations. We resist the enterprises of England first, because they first\r\ncome vitally home to us. And our feelings repel the logic of bearing the\r\nlash of George the III. for fear of that of Bonaparte at some future\r\nday. When the wrongs of France shall reach us with equal effect, we\r\nshall resist them also. But one at a time is enough; and having offered\r\na choice to the champions, England first takes up the gauntlet.\r\n\r\nThe English newspapers suppose me the personal enemy of their nation. I\r\nam not so. I am an enemy to its injuries, as I am to those of France.\r\nIf I could permit myself to have national partialities, and if the\r\nconduct of England would have permitted them to be directed towards\r\nher, they would have been so. I thought that in the administration of\r\nMr. Addington, I discovered some dispositions toward justice, and even\r\nfriendship and respect for us, and began to pave the way for cherishing\r\nthese dispositions, and improving them into ties of mutual good will.\r\nBut we had then a federal minister there, whose dispositions to believe\r\nhimself, and to inspire others with a belief in our sincerity, his\r\nsubsequent conduct has brought into doubt; and poor Merry, the English\r\nminister here, had learned nothing of diplomacy but its suspicions,\r\nwithout head enough to distinguish when they were misplaced. Mr. Addington\r\nand Mr. Fox passed away too soon to avail the two countries of their\r\ndispositions. Had I been personally hostile to England, and biased in\r\nfavor of either the character or views of her great antagonist, the\r\naffair of the Chesapeake put war into my hand. I had only to open it\r\nand let havoc loose. But if ever I was gratified with the possession of\r\npower, and of the confidence of those who had entrusted me with it, it\r\nwas on that occasion when I was enabled to use both for the prevention\r\nof war, towards which the torrent of passion here was directed almost\r\nirresistibly, and when not another person in the United States, less\r\nsupported by authority and favor, could have resisted it. And now that a\r\ndefinitive adherence to her impressments and orders of council renders\r\nwar no longer avoidable, my earnest prayer is that our government may\r\nenter into no compact of common cause with the other belligerent, but\r\nkeep us free to make a separate peace, whenever England will separately\r\ngive us peace and future security. But Lord Liverpool is our witness\r\nthat this can never be but by her removal from our neighborhood.\r\n\r\nI have thus, for a moment, taken a range into the field of politics,\r\nto possess you with the view we take of things here. But in the scenes\r\nwhich are to ensue, I am to be but a spectator. I have withdrawn myself\r\nfrom all political intermeddlings, to indulge the evening of my life\r\nwith what have been the passions of every portion of it, books, science,\r\nmy farms, my family and friends. To these every hour of the day is now\r\ndevoted. I retain a good activity of mind, not quite as much of body,\r\nbut uninterrupted health. Still the hand of age is upon me. All my old\r\nfriends are nearly gone. Of those in my neighborhood, Mr. Divers and Mr.\r\nLindsay alone remain. If you could make it a partie quarrée, it would\r\nbe a comfort indeed. We would beguile our lingering hours with talking\r\nover our youthful exploits, our hunts on Peter's mountain, with a long\r\ntrain of _et cetera_, in addition, and feel, by recollection at least, a\r\nmomentary flash of youth. Reviewing the course of a long and sufficiently\r\nsuccessful life, I find in no portion of it happier moments than those\r\nwere. I think the old hulk in which you are, is near her wreck, and that\r\nlike a prudent rat, you should escape in time. However, here, there, and\r\neverywhere, in peace or in war, you will have my sincere affections and\r\nprayers for your life, health and happiness.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. RODMAN.\r\n\r\n                                                MONTICELLO, April 25, 1812.\r\n\r\nThomas Jefferson presents his complements to Mr. Rodman, and his thanks\r\nfor the translation of Montgalliard's work which he has been so kind\r\nas to send him. It certainly presents some new and true views of the\r\nsituation of England. It is a subject of deep regret to see a great\r\nnation reduced from an unexampled height of prosperity to an abyss of\r\nruin, by the long-continued rule of a single chief. All we ought to wish\r\nas to both belligerent parties is to see them forced to disgorge what\r\ntheir ravenous appetites have taken from others, and reduced to the\r\nnecessity of observing moral duties in future. If we read with regret\r\nwhat concerns England, the fulsome adulation of the author towards his\r\nown chief excites nausea and disgust at the state of degradation to\r\nwhich the mind of man is reduced by subjection to the inordinate power\r\nof another. He salutes Mr. Rodman with great respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. JOHN JACOB ASTOR.\r\n\r\n                                                  MONTICELLO, May 24, 1812.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your letter of March 14th lingered much on the road, and a long\r\njourney before I could answer it, has delayed its acknowledgment till\r\nnow. I am sorry your enterprise for establishing a factory on the\r\nColumbia river, and a commerce through the line of that river and the\r\nMissouri, should meet with the difficulties stated in your letter.\r\nI remember well having invited your proposition on that subject, and\r\nencouraged it with the assurance of every facility and protection which\r\nthe government could properly afford. I considered as a great public\r\nacquisition the commencement of a settlement on that point of the Western\r\ncoast of America, and looked forward with gratification to the time\r\nwhen its descendants should have spread themselves through the whole\r\nlength of that coast, covering it with free and independent Americans,\r\nunconnected with us but by the ties of blood and interest, and employing\r\nlike us the rights of self-government. I hope the obstacles you state\r\nare not insurmountable; that they will not endanger, or even delay the\r\naccomplishment of so great a public purpose. In the present state of\r\naffairs between Great Britain and us, the government is justly jealous of\r\ncontraventions of those commercial restrictions which have been deemed\r\nnecessary to exclude the use of British manufactures in these States,\r\nand to promote the establishment of similar ones among ourselves. The\r\ninterests too of the revenue require particular watchfulness. But in\r\nthe non-importation of British manufactures, and the revenue raised on\r\nforeign goods, the legislature could only have in view the consumption\r\nof our own citizens, and the revenue to be levied on that. We certainly\r\ndid not mean to interfere with the consumption of nations foreign to us,\r\nas the Indians of the Columbia and Missouri are, or to assume a right\r\nof levying an impost on that consumption; and if the words of the laws\r\ntake in their supplies in either view, it was probably unintentional, and\r\nbecause their case not being under the contemplation of the legislature,\r\nhas been inadvertently embraced by it. The question with them would be\r\nnot what manufactures these nations should use, or what taxes they should\r\npay us on them, but whether we should give a transit for them through\r\nour country. We have a right to say we will not let the British exercise\r\nthat transit. But it is our interest as well as a neighborly duty to\r\nallow it when exercised by our own citizens only. To guard against any\r\nsurreptitious introduction of British influence among those nations,\r\nwe may justifiably require that no Englishman be permitted to go with\r\nthe trading parties, and necessary precautions should also be taken to\r\nprevent this covering the contravention of our own laws and views. But\r\nthese once securely guarded, our interest would permit the transit free\r\nof duty. And I do presume that if the subject were fully presented to\r\nthe legislature, they would provide that the laws intended to guard our\r\nown concerns only, should not assume the regulation of those of foreign\r\nand independent nations; still less that they should stand in the way\r\nof so interesting an object as that of planting the germ of an American\r\npopulation on the shores of the Pacific. From meddling however with\r\nthese subjects it is my duty as well as my inclination to abstain. They\r\nare in hands perfectly qualified to direct them, and who knowing better\r\nthe present state of things, are better able to decide what is right;\r\nand whatever they decide on a full view of the case, I shall implicitly\r\nconfide has been rightly decided. Accept my best wishes for your success,\r\nand the assurances of my great esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\n                                                  MONTICELLO, May 30, 1812.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Another _communication_ is enclosed, and the letter of the\r\napplicant is the only information I have of his qualifications. I barely\r\nremember such a person as the secretary of Mr. Adams, and messenger to\r\nthe Senate while I was of that body. It enlarges the sphere of choice by\r\nadding to it a strong federalist. The triangular war must be the idea\r\nof the Anglomen and malcontents, in other words, the federalists and\r\nquids. Yet it would reconcile neither. It would only change the topic of\r\nabuse with the former, and not cure the mental disease of the latter.\r\nIt would prevent our eastern capitalists and seamen from employment in\r\nprivateering, take away the only chance of conciliating them, and keep\r\nthem at home, idle, to swell the discontents; it would completely disarm\r\nus of the most powerful weapon we can employ against Great Britain,\r\nby shutting every port to our prizes, and yet would not add a single\r\nvessel to their number; it would shut every market to our agricultural\r\nproductions, and engender impatience and discontent with that class which,\r\nin fact, composes the nation; it would insulate us in general negotiations\r\nfor peace, making all the parties our opposers, and very indifferent\r\nabout peace with us, if they have it with the rest of the world, and\r\nwould exhibit a solecism worthy of Don Quixotte only, that of a choice\r\nto fight two enemies at a time, rather than to take them by succession.\r\nAnd the only motive for all this is a sublimated impartiality, at which\r\nthe world will laugh, and our own people will turn upon us in mass as\r\nsoon as it is explained to them, as it will be by the very persons who\r\nare now laying that snare. These are the hasty views of one who rarely\r\nthinks on these subjects. Your own will be better, and I pray to them\r\nevery success, and to yourself every felicity.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n                                                  MONTICELLO, June 6, 1812.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have taken the liberty of drawing the attention of the\r\nSecretary at War to a small depôt of military stores at New London, and\r\nleave the letter open for your perusal. Be so good as to seal it before\r\ndelivery. I really thought that General Dearborne had removed them to\r\nLynchburg, undoubtedly a safer and more convenient deposit.\r\n\r\nOur county is the only one I have heard of which has required a draught;\r\nthis proceeded from a mistake of the colonel, who thought he could not\r\nreceive individual offers, but that the whole quota, 241, must present\r\nthemselves at once. Every one, however, manifests the utmost alacrity; of\r\nthe 241 there having been but ten absentees at the first muster called. A\r\nfurther proof is that Captain Carr's company of volunteer cavalry being\r\nspecifically called for by the Governor, though consisting of but 28\r\nwhen called on, has got up to 50 by new engagements since their call was\r\nknown. The only inquiry they make is whether they are to go to Canada or\r\nFlorida? Not a man, as far as I have learned, entertains any of those\r\ndoubts which puzzle the lawyers of Congress and astonish common sense,\r\nwhether it is lawful for them to pursue a retreating enemy across the\r\nboundary line of the Union?\r\n\r\nI hope Barlow's correspondence has satisfied all our Quixottes who thought\r\nwe should undertake nothing less than to fight all Europe at once. I\r\nenclose you a letter from Dr. Bruff, a mighty good and very ingenious\r\nman. His method of manufacturing bullets and shot, has the merit of\r\nincreasing their specific gravity greatly, (being made by composition,)\r\nand rendering them as much heavier and better than the common leaden\r\nbullet, as that is than an iron one. It is a pity he should not have\r\nthe benefit of furnishing the public when it would be equally to their\r\nbenefit also. God bless you.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n                                                 MONTICELLO, June 11, 1812.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--By our post preceding that which brought your letter of May\r\n21st, I had received one from Mr. Malcolm on the same subject with\r\nyours, and by the return of the post had stated to the President my\r\nrecollections of him. But both your letters were probably too late; as\r\nthe appointment had been already made, if we may credit the newspapers.\r\n\r\nYou ask if there is any book that pretends to give any account of the\r\ntraditions of the Indians, or how one can acquire an idea of them? Some\r\nscanty accounts of their traditions, but fuller of their customs and\r\ncharacters, are given us by most of the early travellers among them; these\r\nyou know were mostly French. Lafitan, among them, and Adair an Englishman,\r\nhave written on this subject; the former two volumes, the latter one,\r\nall in 4to. But unluckily Lafitan had in his head a preconceived theory\r\non the mythology, manners, institutions and government of the ancient\r\nnations of Europe, Asia and Africa, and seems to have entered on those\r\nof America only to fit them into the same frame, and to draw from them\r\na confirmation of his general theory. He keeps up a perpetual parallel,\r\nin all those articles, between the Indians of America and the ancients\r\nof the other quarters of the globe. He selects, therefore, all the facts\r\nand adopts all the falsehoods which favor his theory, and very gravely\r\nretails such absurdities as zeal for a theory could alone swallow. He\r\nwas a man of much classical and scriptural reading, and has rendered\r\nhis book not unentertaining. He resided five years among the Northern\r\nIndians, as a Missionary, but collects his matter much more from the\r\nwritings of others, than from his own observation.\r\n\r\nAdair too had his kink. He believed all the Indians of America to be\r\ndescended from the Jews; the same laws, usages, rites and ceremonies,\r\nthe same sacrifices, priests, prophets, fasts and festivals, almost\r\nthe same religion, and that they all spoke Hebrew. For, although he\r\nwrites particularly of the Southern Indians only, the Catawbas, Creeks,\r\nCherokees, Chickasaws and Chocktaws, with whom alone he was personally\r\nacquainted, yet he generalizes whatever he found among them, and brings\r\nhimself to believe that the hundred languages of America, differing\r\nfundamentally every one from every other, as much as Greek from Gothic,\r\nyet have all one common prototype. He was a trader, a man of learning,\r\na self-taught Hebraist, a strong religionist, and of as sound a mind\r\nas Don Quixotte in whatever did not touch his religious chivalry. His\r\nbook contains a great deal of real instruction on its subject, only\r\nrequiring the reader to be constantly on his guard against the wonderful\r\nobliquities of his theory.\r\n\r\nThe scope of your inquiry would scarcely, I suppose, take in the three\r\nfolio volumes of Latin of De Bry. In these, facts and fable are mingled\r\ntogether, without regard to any favorite system. They are less suspicious,\r\ntherefore, in their complexion, more original and authentic, than those\r\nof Lafitan and Adair. This is a work of great curiosity, extremely rare,\r\nso as never to be bought in Europe, but on the breaking up and selling\r\nsome ancient library. On one of these occasions a bookseller procured me\r\na copy, which, unless you have one, is probably the only one in America.\r\n\r\nYou ask further, if the Indians have any order of priesthood among them,\r\nlike the Druids, Bards or Minstrels of the Celtic nations? Adair alone,\r\ndetermined to see what he wished to see in every object, metamorphoses\r\ntheir Conjurers into an order of priests, and describes their sorceries\r\nas if they were the great religious ceremonies of the nation. Lafitan\r\ncalled them by their proper names, Jongleurs, Devins, Sortileges; De Bry\r\npraestigiatores; Adair himself sometimes Magi, Archimagi, cunning men,\r\nSeers, rain makers; and the modern Indian interpreters call them conjurers\r\nand witches. They are persons pretending to have communications with\r\nthe devil and other evil spirits, to foretell future events, bring down\r\nrain, find stolen goods, raise the dead, destroy some and heal others\r\nby enchantment, lay spells, &c. And Adair, without departing from his\r\nparallel of the Jews and Indians, might have found their counterpart\r\nmuch more aptly, among the soothsayers, sorcerers and wizards of the\r\nJews, their Gannes and Gambres, their Simon Magus, Witch of Endor, and\r\nthe young damsel whose sorceries disturbed Paul so much; instead of\r\nplacing them in a line with their high-priest, their chief priests, and\r\ntheir magnificent hierarchy generally. In the solemn ceremonies of the\r\nIndians, the persons who direct or officiate, are their chiefs, elders\r\nand warriors, in civil ceremonies or in those of war; it is the head\r\nof the cabin in their private or particular feasts or ceremonies; and\r\nsometimes the matrons, as in their corn feasts. And even here, Adair\r\nmight have kept up his parallel, with ennobling his conjurers. For the\r\nancient patriarchs, the Noahs, the Abrahams, Isaacs and Jacobs, and even\r\nafter the consecration of Aaron, the Samuels and Elijahs, and we may say\r\nfurther, every one for himself offered sacrifices on the altars. The\r\ntrue line of distinction seems to be, that solemn ceremonies, whether\r\npublic or private, addressed to the Great Spirit, are conducted by the\r\nworthies of the nation, men or matrons, while conjurers are resorted\r\nto only for the invocation of evil spirits. The present state of the\r\nseveral Indian tribes, without any public order of priests, is proof\r\nsufficient that they never had such an order. Their steady habits permit\r\nno innovations, not even those which the progress of science offers\r\nto increase the comforts, enlarge the understanding, and improve the\r\nmorality of mankind. Indeed, so little idea have they of a regular order\r\nof priests, that they mistake ours for their conjurers, and call them\r\nby that name.\r\n\r\nSo much in answer to your inquiries concerning Indians, a people with\r\nwhom, in the early part of my life, I was very familiar, and acquired\r\nimpressions of attachment and commiseration for them which have never\r\nbeen obliterated. Before the revolution, they were in the habit of\r\ncoming often and in great numbers to the seat of government, where I was\r\nvery much with them. I knew much the great Ontassetè, the warrior and\r\norator of the Cherokees; he was always the guest of my father, on his\r\njourneys to and from Williamsburg. I was in his camp when he made his\r\ngreat farewell oration to his people the evening before his departure for\r\nEngland. The moon was in full splendor, and to her he seemed to address\r\nhimself in his prayers for his own safety on the voyage, and that of his\r\npeople during his absence; his sounding voice, distinct articulation,\r\nanimated action, and the solemn silence of his people at their several\r\nfires, filled me with awe and veneration, although I did not understand\r\na word he uttered. That nation, consisting now of about 2,000 warriors,\r\nand the Creeks of about 3,000 are far advanced in civilization. They\r\nhave good cabins, enclosed fields, large herds of cattle and hogs, spin\r\nand weave their own clothes of cotton, have smiths and other of the most\r\nnecessary tradesmen, write and read, are on the increase in numbers,\r\nand a branch of Cherokees is now instituting a regular representative\r\ngovernment. Some other tribes are advancing in the same line. On those\r\nwho have made any progress, English seductions will have no effect. But\r\nthe backward will yield, and be thrown further back. Those will relapse\r\ninto barbarism and misery, lose numbers by war and want, and we shall\r\nbe obliged to drive them with the beasts of the forest into the stony\r\nmountains. They will be conquered, however, in Canada. The possession of\r\nthat country secures our women and children forever from the tomahawk\r\nand scalping knife, by removing those who excite them; and for this\r\npossession orders, I presume, are issued by this time; taking for granted\r\nthat the doors of Congress will re-open with a declaration of war. That\r\nthis may end in indemnity for the past, security for the future, and\r\ncomplete emancipation from Anglomany, Gallomany, and all the manias of\r\ndemoralized Europe, and that you may live in health and happiness to\r\nsee all this, is the sincere prayer of yours affectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ELBRIDGE GERRY.\r\n\r\n                                                 MONTICELLO, June 11, 1812.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--It has given me great pleasure to receive a letter from you.\r\nIt seems as if, our ancient friends dying off, the whole mass of the\r\naffections of the heart survives undiminished to the few who remain.\r\nI think our acquaintance commenced in 1764, both then just of age. We\r\nhappened to take lodgings in the same house in New York. Our next meeting\r\nwas in the Congress of 1775, and at various times afterwards in the\r\nexercise of that and other public functions, until your mission to Europe.\r\nSince we have ceased to meet, we have still thought and acted together,\r\n\"_et idem velle, atque idem nolle, ea demum amicitia est_.\" Of this\r\nharmony of principle, the papers you enclosed me are proof sufficient. I\r\ndo not condole with you on your release from your government. The vote\r\nof your opponents is the most honorable mark by which the soundness of\r\nyour conduct could be stamped. I claim the same honorable testimonial.\r\nThere was but a single act of my whole administration of which that party\r\napproved. That was the proclamation on the attack of the Chesapeake. And\r\nwhen I found they approved of it, I confess I began strongly to apprehend\r\nI had done wrong, and to exclaim with the Psalmist, \"Lord, what have I\r\ndone that the wicked should praise me!\"\r\n\r\nWhat, then, does this English faction with you mean? Their newspapers\r\nsay rebellion, and that they will not remain united with us unless we\r\nwill permit them to govern the majority. If this be their purpose, their\r\nanti-republican spirit, it ought to be met at once. But a government\r\nlike ours should be slow in believing this, should put forth its whole\r\nmight when necessary to suppress it, and promptly return to the paths\r\nof reconciliation. The extent of our country secures it, I hope, from\r\nthe vindictive passions of the petty incorporations of Greece. I rather\r\nsuspect that the principal office of the other seventeen States will be\r\nto moderate and restrain the local excitement of our friends with you,\r\nwhen they (with the aid of their brethren of the other States, if they\r\nneed it) shall have brought the rebellious to their feet. They count on\r\nBritish aid. But what can that avail them by land? They would separate\r\nfrom their friends, who alone furnish employment for their navigation,\r\nto unite with their only rival for that employment. When interdicted\r\nthe harbors of their quondam brethren, they will go, I suppose to ask\r\na share in the carrying trade of their rivals, and a dispensation with\r\ntheir navigation act. They think they will be happier in an association\r\nunder the rulers of Ireland, the East and West Indies, than in an\r\nindependent government, where they are obliged to put up with their\r\nproportional share only in the direction of its affairs. But I trust\r\nthat such perverseness will not be that of the honest and well-meaning\r\nmass of the federalists of Massachusetts; and that when the questions of\r\nseparation and rebellion shall be nakedly proposed to them, the Gores\r\nand the Pickerings will find their levees crowded with silk stocking\r\ngentry, but no yeomanry; an army of officers without soldiers. I hope,\r\nthen, all will still end well; the Anglomen will consent to make peace\r\nwith their bread and butter, and you and I shall sink to rest, without\r\nhaving been actors or spectators in another civil war.\r\n\r\nHow many children have you? You beat me, I expect, in that count, but I\r\nyou in that of our grand-children. We have not timed these things well\r\ntogether, or we might have begun a re-alliance between Massachusetts\r\nand the Old Dominion, faithful companions in the war of Independence,\r\npeculiarly tallied in interests, by each wanting exactly what the other\r\nhas to spare; and estranged to each other in latter times, only by the\r\npractices of a third nation, the common enemy of both. Let us live only\r\nto see this re-union, and I will say with old Simeon, \"Lord, now lettest\r\nthou thy servant depart in peace, for mine eyes have seen thy salvation.\"\r\nIn that peace may you long remain, my friend, and depart only in the\r\nfulness of years, all passed in health and prosperity. God bless you.\r\n\r\nP. S. June 13. I did not condole with you on the reprobation of your\r\nopponents, because it proved your orthodoxy. Yesterday's post brought\r\nme the resolution of the republicans of Congress, to propose you as\r\nVice President. On this I sincerely congratulate you. It is a stamp of\r\ndouble proof. It is a notification to the factionaries that their nay is\r\nthe yea of truth, and its best test. We shall be almost within striking\r\ndistance of each other. Who knows but you may fill up some short recess\r\nof Congress with a visit to Monticello, where a numerous family will\r\nhail you with a hearty country welcome.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JUDGE TYLER.\r\n\r\n                                                 MONTICELLO, June 17, 1812.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--* * * * *\r\n\r\nOn the other subject of your letter, the application of the common law to\r\nour present situation, I deride with you the ordinary doctrine, that we\r\nbrought with us from England the _common law rights_. This narrow notion\r\nwas a favorite in the first moment of rallying to our rights against Great\r\nBritain. But it was that of men who felt their rights before they had\r\nthought of their explanation. The truth is, that we brought with us the\r\n_rights of men_; of expatriated men. On our arrival here, the question\r\nwould at once arise, by what law will we govern ourselves? The resolution\r\nseems to have been, by that system with which we are familiar, to be\r\naltered by ourselves occasionally, and adapted to our new situation.\r\nThe proofs of this resolution are to be found in the form of the oaths\r\nof the judges, 1. Hening's Stat. 169. 187; of the Governor, ib. 504; in\r\nthe act for a provisional government, ib. 372; in the preamble to the\r\nlaws of 1661-2; the uniform current of opinions and decisions, and in\r\nthe general recognition of all our statutes, framed on that basis. But\r\nthe state of the English law at the date of our emigration, constituted\r\nthe system adopted here. We may doubt, therefore, the propriety of\r\nquoting in our courts English authorities subsequent to that adoption;\r\nstill more, the admission of authorities posterior to the Declaration of\r\nIndependence, or rather to the accession of that King, whose reign, _ab\r\ninitio_, was the very tissue of wrongs which rendered the Declaration\r\nat length necessary. The reason for it had inception at least as far\r\nback as the commencement of his reign. This relation to the beginning of\r\nhis reign, would add the advantage of getting us rid of all Mansfield's\r\ninnovations, or civilizations of the common law. For however I admit the\r\nsuperiority of the civil over the common law code, as a system of perfect\r\njustice, yet an incorporation of the two would be like Nebuchadnezzar's\r\nimage of metals and clay, a thing without cohesion of parts. The only\r\nnatural improvement of the common law, is through its homogeneous ally,\r\nthe chancery, in which new principles are to be examined, concocted and\r\ndigested. But when, by repeated decisions and modifications, they are\r\nrendered pure and certain, they should be transferred by statute to the\r\ncourts of common law, and placed within the pale of juries. The exclusion\r\nfrom the courts of the malign influence of all authorities after the\r\n_Georgium sidus_ became ascendant, would uncanonize Blackstone, whose\r\nbook, although the most elegant and best digested of our law catalogue,\r\nhas been perverted more than all others, to the degeneracy of legal\r\nscience. A student finds there a smattering of everything, and his\r\nindolence easily persuades him that if he understands that book, he is\r\nmaster of the whole body of the law. The distinction between these, and\r\nthose who have drawn their stores from the deep and rich mines of Coke\r\nLittleton, seems well understood even by the unlettered common people,\r\nwho apply the appellation of Blackstone lawyers to these ephemeral\r\ninsects of the law.\r\n\r\nWhether we should undertake to reduce the common law, our own, and so\r\nmuch of the English statutes as we have adopted, to a text, is a question\r\nof transcendent difficulty. It was discussed at the first meeting of the\r\ncommittee of the revised code, in 1776, and decided in the negative, by\r\nthe opinions of Wythe, Mason and myself, against Pendleton and Thomas Lee.\r\nPendleton proposed to take Blackstone for that text, only purging him\r\nof what was inapplicable or unsuitable to us. In that case, the meaning\r\nof every word of Blackstone would have become a source of litigation,\r\nuntil it had been settled by repeated legal decisions. And to come at\r\nthat meaning, we should have had produced, on all occasions, that very\r\npile of authorities from which it would be said he drew his conclusion,\r\nand which, of course, would explain it, and the terms in which it is\r\ncouched. Thus we should have retained the same chaos of law-lore from\r\nwhich we wished to be emancipated, added to the evils of the uncertainty\r\nwhich a new text and new phrases would have generated. An example of this\r\nmay be found in the old statutes, and commentaries on them, in Coke's\r\nsecond institute, but more remarkably in the institute of Justinian,\r\nand the vast masses explanatory or supplementary of that which fill the\r\nlibraries of the civilians. We were deterred from the attempt by these\r\nconsiderations, added to which, the bustle of the times did not admit\r\nleisure for such an undertaking.\r\n\r\nYour request of my opinion on this subject has given you the trouble\r\nof these observations. If your firmer mind in encountering difficulties\r\nwould have added your vote to the minority of the committee, you would\r\nhave had on your side one of the greatest men of our age, and like him,\r\nhave detracted nothing from the sentiments of esteem and respect which\r\nI bore to him, and tender with sincerity the assurance of to yourself.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL KOSCIUSKO.\r\n\r\n                                                 MONTICELLO, June 28, 1812.\r\n\r\nNous voila donc, mon cher ami, en guerre avec l'Angleterre. This was\r\ndeclared on the 18th instant, thirty years after the signature of our\r\npeace in 1782. Within these thirty years what a vast course of growth and\r\nprosperity we have had! It is not ten years since Great Britain began\r\na series of insults and injuries which would have been met with war in\r\nthe threshold by any European power. This course has been unremittingly\r\nfollowed up by increasing wrongs, with glimmerings indeed of peaceable\r\nredress, just sufficient to keep us quiet, till she has had the impudence\r\nat length to extinguish even these glimmerings by open avowal. This would\r\nnot have been borne so long, but that France has kept pace with England\r\nin iniquity of principle, although not in the power of inflicting wrongs\r\non us. The difficulty of selecting a foe between them has spared us\r\nmany years of war, and enabled us to enter into it with less debt, more\r\nstrength and preparation. Our present enemy will have the sea to herself,\r\nwhile we shall be equally predominant at land, and shall strip her of\r\nall her possessions on this continent. She may burn New York, indeed, by\r\nher ships and congreve rockets, in which case we must burn the city of\r\nLondon by hired incendiaries, of which her starving manufacturers will\r\nfurnish abundance. A people in such desperation as to demand of their\r\ngovernment _aut parcem, aut furcam_, either bread or the gallows, will\r\nnot reject the same alternative when offered by a foreign hand. Hunger\r\nwill make them brave every risk for bread. The partisans of England\r\nhere have endeavored much to goad us into the folly of choosing the\r\nocean instead of the land, for the theatre of war. That would be to meet\r\ntheir strength with our own weakness, instead of their weakness with\r\nour strength. I hope we shall confine ourselves to the conquest of their\r\npossessions, and defence of our harbors, leaving the war on the ocean to\r\nour privateers. These will immediately swarm in every sea, and do more\r\ninjury to British commerce than the regular fleets of all Europe would\r\ndo. The government of France may discontinue their license trade. Our\r\nprivateers will furnish them much more abundantly with colonial produce,\r\nand whatever the license trade has given them. Some have apprehended we\r\nshould be overwhelmed by the new improvements of war, which have not yet\r\nreached us. But the British possess them very imperfectly, and what are\r\nthese improvements? Chiefly in the management of artillery, of which our\r\ncountry admits little use. We have nothing to fear from their armies,\r\nand shall put nothing in prize to their fleets. Upon the whole, I have\r\nknown no war entered into under more favorable auspices.\r\n\r\nOur manufacturers are now very nearly on a footing with those of England.\r\nShe has not a single improvement which we do not possess, and many of\r\nthem better adapted by ourselves to our ordinary use. We have reduced\r\nthe large and expensive machinery for most things to the compass of a\r\nprivate family, and every family of any size is now getting machines\r\non a small scale for their household purposes. Quoting myself as an\r\nexample, and I am much behind many others in this business, my household\r\nmanufactures are just getting into operation on the scale of a carding\r\nmachine costing $60 only, which may be worked by a girl of twelve years\r\nold, a spinning machine, which may be made for $10, carrying 6 spindles\r\nfor wool, to be worked by a girl also, another which can be made for\r\n$25, carrying 12 spindles for cotton, and a loom, with a flying shuttle,\r\nweaving its twenty yards a day. I need 2,000 yards of linen, cotton and\r\nwoollen yearly, to clothe my family, which this machinery, costing $150\r\nonly, and worked by two women and two girls, will more than furnish.\r\nFor fine goods there are numerous establishments at work in the large\r\ncities, and many more daily growing up; and of merinos we have some\r\nthousands, and these multiplying fast. We consider a sheep for every\r\nperson as sufficient for their woollen clothing, and this State and all\r\nto the north have fully that, and those to the south and west will soon\r\nbe up to it. In other articles we are equally advanced, so that nothing\r\nis more certain than that, come peace when it will, we shall never again\r\ngo to England for a shilling where we have gone for a dollar's worth.\r\nInstead of applying to her manufacturers there, they must starve or come\r\nhere to be employed. I give you these details of peaceable operations,\r\nbecause they are within my present sphere. Those of war are in better\r\nhands, who know how to keep their own secrets. Because, too, although\r\na soldier yourself, I am sure you contemplate the peaceable employment\r\nof man in the improvement of his condition, with more pleasure than his\r\nmurders, rapine and devastations.\r\n\r\nMr. Barnes, some time ago, forwarded you a bill of exchange for 5,500\r\nfrancs, of which the enclosed is a duplicate. Apprehending that a war\r\nwith England would subject the remittances to you to more casualties,\r\nI proposed to Mr. Morson, of Bordeaux, to become the intermediate for\r\nmaking remittances to you, which he readily acceded to on liberal ideas\r\narising from his personal esteem for you, and his desire to be useful\r\nto you. If you approve of this medium I am in hopes it will shield you\r\nfrom the effect of the accidents to which the increased dangers of the\r\nseas may give birth. It would give me great pleasure to hear from you\r\noftener. I feel great interest in your health and happiness. I know\r\nyour feelings on the present state of the world, and hope they will be\r\ncheered by the successful course of our war, and the addition of Canada\r\nto our confederacy. The infamous intrigues of Great Britain to destroy\r\nour government (of which Henry's is but one sample), and with the Indians\r\nto tomahawk our women and children, prove that the cession of Canada,\r\ntheir fulcrum for these Machiavelian levers, must be a _sine qua non_ at\r\na treaty of peace. God bless you, and give you to see all these things,\r\nand many and long years of health and happiness.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n                                                 MONTICELLO, June 29, 1812.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I duly received your favor of the 22d covering the declaration\r\nof war. It is entirely popular here, the only opinion being that it should\r\nhave been issued the moment the season admitted the militia to enter\r\nCanada. * * * * * To continue the war popular, two things are necessary\r\nmainly. 1. To stop Indian barbarities. The conquest of Canada will do\r\nthis. 2. To furnish markets for our produce, say indeed for our flour,\r\nfor tobacco is already given up, and seemingly without reluctance. The\r\ngreat profits of the wheat crop have allured every one to it; and never\r\nwas such a crop on the ground as that which we generally begin to cut\r\nthis day. It would be mortifying to the farmer to see such an one rot\r\nin his barn. It would soon sicken him to war. Nor can this be a matter\r\nof wonder or of blame on him. Ours is the only country on earth where\r\nwar is an instantaneous and total suspension of all the objects of his\r\nindustry and support. For carrying our produce to foreign markets our\r\nown ships, neutral ships, and even enemy ships under neutral flag, which\r\nI would wink at, will probably suffice. But the coasting trade is of\r\ndouble importance, because both seller and buyer are disappointed, and\r\nboth are our own citizens. You will remember that in this trade our\r\ngreatest distress in the last war was produced by our own pilot boats\r\ntaken by the British and kept as tenders to their larger vessels. These\r\nbeing the swiftest vessels on the ocean, they took them and selected the\r\nswiftest from the whole mass. Filled with men they scoured everything\r\nalong shore, and completely cut up that coasting business which might\r\notherwise have been carried on within the range of vessels of force and\r\ndraught. Why should not we then line our coast with vessels of pilot-boat\r\nconstruction, filled with men, armed with cannonades, and only so much\r\nlarger as to assure the mastery of the pilot boat? The British cannot\r\ncounter-work us by building similar ones, because, the fact is, however\r\nunaccountable, that our builders alone understand that construction.\r\nIt is on our own pilot boats the British will depend, which our larger\r\nvessels may thus retake. These, however, are the ideas of a landsman\r\nonly, Mr. Hamilton's judgment will test their soundness.\r\n\r\nOur militia are much afraid of being called to Norfolk at this season.\r\nThey all declare a preference of a march to Canada. I trust however\r\nthat Governor Barbour will attend to circumstances, and so apportion the\r\nservice among the counties, that those acclimated by birth or residence\r\nmay perform the summer tour, and the winter service be allotted to the\r\nupper counties.\r\n\r\nI trouble you with a letter for General Kosciusko. It covers a bill of\r\nexchange from Mr. Barnes for him, and is therefore of great importance\r\nto him. Hoping you will have the goodness so far to befriend the General\r\nas to give it your safest conveyance, I commit it to you, with the\r\nassurance of my sincere affections.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO NATHANIEL GREENE, MONTAGUE CENTER.\r\n\r\n                                                  MONTICELLO, July 5, 1812.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your favor of May 19th from New Orleans is just now received. I\r\nhave no doubt that the information you will present to your countrymen\r\non the subject of the Asiatic countries into which you have travelled,\r\nwill be acceptable as sources both of amusement and instruction; and\r\nthe more so, as the observations of an American will be more likely to\r\npresent what are peculiarities to us, than those of any foreigner on\r\nthe same countries. In reading the travels of a Frenchman through the\r\nUnited States what he remarks as peculiarities in us, prove to us the\r\ncontrary peculiarities of the French. We have the accounts of Barbary from\r\nEuropean and American travellers. It would be more amusing if Melli Melli\r\nwould give us his observations on the United States. If, with the fables\r\nand follies of the Hindoos, so justly pointed out to us by yourselves\r\nand other travellers, we could compare the contrast of those which an\r\nHindoo traveller would imagine he found among us, it might enlarge our\r\ninstruction. It would be curious to see what parallel among us he would\r\nselect for his Veeshni. What you will have seen in your western tour\r\nwill also instruct many who often know least of things nearest home.\r\n\r\nThe charitable institution you have proposed to the city of New Orleans\r\nwould undoubtedly be valuable, and all such are better managed by those\r\nlocally connected with them. The great wealth of that city will insure\r\nits support, and the names subscribed to it will give it success. For\r\na private individual, a thousand miles distant, to imagine that his\r\nname could add anything to what exhibits already the patronage of the\r\nhighest authorities of the State, would be great presumption. It will\r\ncertainly engage my best wishes, to which permit me to add for yourself\r\nthe assurances of my respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THOMAS COOPER, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                                 MONTICELLO, July 10, 1812.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I received by your last post through Mr. Hall, of Baltimore,\r\na copy of your introductory lecture to a course of chemistry, for which\r\naccept my thanks. I have just entered on the reading of it, and perceive\r\nthat I have a feast before me. I discover from an error of the binder,\r\nthat my copy has duplicates of pages 122, 123, 126, 127, and wants\r\naltogether, pages 121, 124, 125, 128, and forseeing that every page will\r\nbe a real loss, and that the book has been printed at Carlisle, I will\r\nrequest your directions to the printer to enclose those four pages under\r\ncover to me at this place, _near Milton_. You know the just esteem which\r\nattached itself to Dr. Franklin's science, because he always endeavored\r\nto direct it to something useful in private life. The chemists have not\r\nbeen attentive enough to this. I have wished to see their science applied\r\nto domestic objects, to malting, for instance, brewing, making cider,\r\nto fermentation and distillation generally, to the making of bread,\r\nbutter, cheese, soap, to the incubation of eggs, &c. And I am happy to\r\nobserve some of these titles in the syllabus of your lecture. I hope\r\nyou will make the chemistry of these subjects intelligible to our good\r\nhouse-wives. Glancing over the pages of your book, the last one caught my\r\nattention, where you recommend to students the books on metaphysics. Not\r\nseeing De Tutt Tracy's name there, I suspected you might not have seen\r\nhis work. His first volume on Ideology appeared in 1800. I happen to have\r\na duplicate of this, and will send it to you. Since that, has appeared\r\nhis second volume on grammar and his third on logic. They are considered\r\nas holding the most eminent station in that line; and considering with\r\nyou that a course of anatomy lays the best foundation for understanding\r\nthese subjects, Tracy should be preceded by a mature study of the most\r\nprofound of all human compositions, \"Cabanis's Rapports du Physique et\r\ndu moral de l'homme.\"\r\n\r\nIn return for the many richer favors received from you, I send you my\r\nlittle tract on the batture of New Orleans, and Livingston's claim to\r\nit. I was at a loss where to get it printed, and confided it to the\r\neditor of the Edinburgh Review, re-printed at New York. But he has not\r\ndone it immaculately. Although there are typographical errors in your\r\nlecture, I wonder to see so difficult a work so well done at Carlisle.\r\nI am making a fair copy of the catalogue of my library, which I mean to\r\nhave printed merely for the use of the library. It will require correct\r\northography in so many languages, that I hardly know where I can get it\r\ndone. Have you read the Review of Montesquieu, printed by Duane? I hope\r\nit will become the elementary book of the youth at all our colleges.\r\nSuch a reduction of Montesquieu to his true value had been long wanting\r\nin political study. Accept the assurance of my great and constant esteem\r\nand respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. LATROBE.\r\n\r\n                                                 MONTICELLO, July 12, 1812.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Of all the faculties of the human mind, that of memory is the\r\nfirst which suffers decay from age. Of the commencement of this decay, I\r\nwas fully sensible while I lived in Washington, and it was my earliest\r\nmonitor to retire from public business. It has often since been the\r\nsource of great regret when applied to by others to attest transactions in\r\nwhich I had been an agent, to find that they had entirely vanished from\r\nmy memory. In no case has it given me more concern than in that which is\r\nthe subject of your letter of the 2d instant: the supper given in 1807\r\nto the workmen on the capitol. Of this supper I have not the smallest\r\nrecollection. If it ever was mentioned to me, not a vestige of it now\r\nremains in my mind. This failure of my memory is no proof the thing did\r\nnot happen, but only takes from it the support of my testimony, which\r\ncannot be given for what is obliterated from it. I have looked among my\r\npapers to see if they furnish any trace of the matter, but I find none,\r\nand must therefore acquiesce in my incompetence to administer to truth\r\non this occasion. I am sorry to learn that Congress has relinquished\r\nthe benefit of the engagements of Andrei & Franzoni, on the sculpture of\r\nthe capitol. They are artists of a grade far above what we can expect to\r\nget again. I still hope they will continue to work on the basis of the\r\nappropriation made, and as far as that will go; so that what is done will\r\nbe well done; and perhaps a more favorable moment may still preserve them\r\nto us. With respect to yourself, the little disquietudes from individuals\r\nnot chosen for their taste in works of art, will be sunk into oblivion,\r\nwhile the Representatives' chamber will remain a durable monument of\r\nyour talents as an architect. I say nothing of the Senate room, because I\r\nhave never seen it. I shall live in the hope that the day will come when\r\nan opportunity will be given you of finishing the middle building in a\r\nstyle worthy of the two wings, and worthy of the first temple dedicated\r\nto the sovereignty of the people, embellishing with Athenian taste the\r\ncourse of a nation looking far beyond the range of Athenian destinies.\r\nIn every situation, public or private, be assured of my sincere wishes\r\nfor your prosperity and happiness, and of the continuance of my esteem\r\nand respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL DUANE.\r\n\r\n                                                MONTICELLO, August 4, 1812.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of the 17th ult. came duly to hand, and I have\r\nto thank you for the military manuals you were so kind as to send me.\r\nThis is the sort of book most needed in our country, where even the\r\nelements of tactics are unknown. The young have never seen service, and\r\nthe old are past it, and of those among them who are not superannuated\r\nthemselves, their science is become so. I see, as you do, the difficulties\r\nand defects we have to encounter in war, and should expect disasters if\r\nwe had an enemy on land capable of inflicting them. But the weakness of\r\nour enemy there will make our first errors innocent, and the seeds of\r\ngenius which nature sows with even hand through every age and country,\r\nand which need only soil and season to germinate, will develop themselves\r\namong our military men. Some of them will become prominent, and seconded\r\nby the native energy of our citizens, will soon, I hope, to our force\r\nadd the benefits of skill. The acquisition of Canada this year, as far\r\nas the neighborhood of Quebec, will be a mere matter of marching, and\r\nwill give us experience for the attack of Halifax the next, and the\r\nfinal expulsion of England from the American continent. Halifax once\r\ntaken, every cock-boat of hers must return to England for repairs. Their\r\nfleet will annihilate our public force on the water, but our privateers\r\nwill eat out the vitals of their commerce. Perhaps they will burn New\r\nYork or Boston. If they do, we must burn the city of London, not by\r\nexpensive fleets or congreve rockets, but by employing an hundred or two\r\nJack-the-painters, whom nakedness, famine, desperation and hardened vice,\r\nwill abundantly furnish from among themselves. We have a rumor now afloat\r\nthat the orders of council are repeated. The thing is impossible after\r\nCastlereagh's late declaration in Parliament, and the re-construction\r\nof a Percival ministry.\r\n\r\nI consider this last circumstance fortunate for us. The repeal of the\r\norders of council would only add recruits to our minority, and enable\r\nthem the more to embarrass our march to thorough redress of our past\r\nwrongs, and permanent security for the future. This we shall attain if\r\nno internal obstacles are raised up. The exclusion of their commerce\r\nfrom the United States, and the closing of the Baltic against it,\r\nwhich the present campaign in Europe will effect, will accomplish the\r\ncatastrophe already so far advanced on them. I think your anticipations\r\nof the effects of this are entirely probable, their arts, their science,\r\nand what they have left of virtue, will come over to us, and although\r\ntheir vices will come also, these, I think, will soon be diluted and\r\nevaporated in a country of plain honesty. Experience will soon teach the\r\nnew-comers how much more plentiful and pleasant is the subsistence gained\r\nby wholesome labor and fair dealing, than a precarious and hazardous\r\ndependence on the enterprises of vice and violence. Still I agree with\r\nyou that these immigrations will give strength to English partialities,\r\nto eradicate which is one of the most consoling expectations from the\r\nwar. But probably the old hive will be broken up by a revolution, and\r\na regeneration of its principles render intercourse with it no longer\r\ncontaminating. A republic there like ours, and a reduction of their naval\r\npower within the limits of their annual facilities of payment, might\r\nrender their existence even interesting to us. It is the construction of\r\ntheir government, and its principles and means of corruption, which make\r\nits continuance inconsistent with the safety of other nations. A change\r\nin its form might make it an honest one, and justify a confidence in\r\nits faith and friendship. That regeneration however will take a longer\r\ntime than I have to live. I shall leave it to be enjoyed among you, and\r\nmake my exit with a bow to it, as the most flagitious of governments\r\nI leave among men. I sincerely wish you may live to see the prodigy of\r\nits renovation, enjoying in the meantime health and prosperity.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL KOSCIUSKO.\r\n\r\n                                                MONTICELLO, August 5, 1812.\r\n\r\nDEAR GENERAL,--* * * * *\r\n\r\nI have little to add to my letter of June. We have entered Upper Canada,\r\nand I think there can be no doubt of our soon having in our possession\r\nthe whole of the St. Lawrence except Quebec. We have at this moment\r\nabout two hundred privateers on the ocean, and numbers more going out\r\ndaily. It is believed we shall fit out about a thousand in the whole.\r\nTheir success has been already great, and I have no doubt they will cut\r\nup more of the commerce of England than all the navies of Europe could\r\ndo, could those navies venture to sea at all. You will find that every\r\nsea on the globe where England has any commerce, and where any port can\r\nbe found to sell prizes, will be filled with our privateers. God bless\r\nyou and give you a long and happy life.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n                                                MONTICELLO, August 5, 1812.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--* * * * *\r\n\r\nI am glad of the re-establishment of a Percival ministry. The opposition\r\nwould have recruited our minority by half way offers. With Canada in\r\nhand we can go to treaty with an off-set for spoliation before the war.\r\nOur farmers are cheerful in the expectation of a good price for wheat in\r\nAutumn. Their pulse will be regulated by this, and not by the successes\r\nor disasters of the war. To keep open sufficient markets is the very\r\nfirst object towards maintaining the popularity of the war, which is as\r\ngreat at present as could be desired. We have just had a fine rain of\r\n1¼ inches in the most critical time for our corn. The weather during\r\nthe harvest was as advantageous as could be. I am sorry to find you\r\nremaining so long at Washington. The effect on your health may lose us a\r\ngreat deal of your time; a couple of months at Montpelier at this season\r\nwould not lose us an hour. Affectionate salutations to Mrs. Madison and\r\nyourself.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE HONORABLE MR. WRIGHT.\r\n\r\n                                                MONTICELLO, August 8, 1812.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I receive and return the congratulations of your letter of\r\nJuly 6 with pleasure, and join the great mass of my fellow citizens in\r\nsaying, \"Well done, good and faithful servants, receive the benedictions\r\nwhich your constituents are ready to give you.\" The British government\r\nseem to be doing late, what done earlier might have prevented war; to\r\nwit: repealing the orders in Council. But it should take more to make\r\npeace than to prevent war. The sword once drawn, full justice must be\r\ndone. \"Indemnification for the past and security for the future,\" should\r\nbe painted on our banners. For 1,000 ships taken, and 6,000 seamen\r\nimpressed, give us Canada for indemnification, and the only security\r\nthey can give us against their Henrys, and the savages, and agree that\r\nthe American flag shall protect the persons of those sailing under it,\r\nboth parties exchanging engagements that neither will receive the seamen\r\nof the other on board their vessels. This done, I should be for peace\r\nwith England and then war with France. One at a time is enough, and in\r\nfighting the one we need the harbors of the other for our prizes. Go on\r\nas you have begun, only quickening your pace, and receive the benedictions\r\nand prayers of those who are too old to offer anything else.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THOMAS LETRE, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                                MONTICELLO, August 8, 1812.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I duly received your favor of the 14th ult., covering a\r\npaper containing proceedings of the patriots of South Carolina. It\r\nadds another to the many proofs of their steady devotion to their own\r\ncountry. I can assure you the hearts of their fellow citizens in this\r\nState beat in perfect unison with them, and with their government. Of\r\nthis their concurrence in the election of Mr. Madison and Mr. Gerry,\r\nat the ensuing election, will give sufficient proof. The schism in\r\nMassachusetts, when brought to the crisis of principle, will be found\r\nto be exactly the same as in the Revolutionary war. The monarchists will\r\nbe left alone, and will appear to be exactly the tories of the last war.\r\nHad the repeal of the orders of council, which now seems probable, taken\r\nplace earlier, it might have prevented war; but much more is requisite\r\nto make peace--\"indemnification for the past, and security for the\r\nfuture,\" should be the motto of the war. 1,000 ships taken, 6,000 seamen\r\nimpressed, savage butcheries of our citizens, and incendiary machinations\r\nagainst our union, declare that they and their allies, the Spaniards,\r\nmust retire from the Atlantic side of our continent as the only security\r\nor indemnification which will be effectual. Accept the assurances of my\r\ngreat esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL WILLIAM DUANE.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, October 1, 1812.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of September the 20th, has been duly received,\r\nand I cannot but be gratified by the assurance it expresses, that my aid\r\nin the councils of our government would increase the public confidence\r\nin them; because it admits an inference that they have approved of\r\nthe course pursued, when I heretofore bore a part in those councils. I\r\nprofess, too, so much of the Roman principle, as to deem it honorable for\r\nthe general of yesterday to act as a corporal to-day, if his services\r\ncan be useful to his country; holding that to be false pride, which\r\npostpones the public good to any private or personal considerations.\r\nBut I am past service. The hand of age is upon me. The decay of bodily\r\nfaculties apprizes me that those of the mind cannot be unimpaired, had\r\nI not still better proofs. Every year counts by increased debility, and\r\ndeparting faculties keep the score. The last year it was the sight, this\r\nit is the hearing, the next something else will be going, until all is\r\ngone. Of all this I was sensible before I left Washington, and probably\r\nmy fellow laborers saw it before I did. The decay of memory was obvious;\r\nit is now become distressing. But the mind too, is weakened. When I\r\nwas young, mathematics was the passion of my life. The same passion has\r\nreturned upon me, but with unequal powers. Processes which I then read\r\noff with the facility of common discourse, now cost me labor, and time,\r\nand slow investigation. When I offered this, therefore, as one of the\r\nreasons deciding my retirement from office, it was offered in sincerity\r\nand a consciousness of its truth. And I think it a great blessing that\r\nI retain understanding enough to be sensible how much of it I have lost,\r\nand to avoid exposing myself as a spectacle for the pity of my friends;\r\nthat I have surmounted the difficult point of knowing when to retire.\r\nAs a compensation for faculties departed, nature gives me good health,\r\nand a perfect resignation to the laws of decay which she has prescribed\r\nto all the forms and combinations of matter.\r\n\r\nThe detestable treason of Hull has, indeed, excited a deep anxiety in all\r\nbreasts. The depression was in the first moment gloomy and portentous.\r\nBut it has been succeeded by a revived animation, and a determination to\r\nmeet the occurrence with increased efforts; and I have so much confidence\r\nin the vigorous minds and bodies of our countrymen, as to be fearless as\r\nto the final issue. The treachery of Hull, like that of Arnold, cannot\r\nbe matter of blame on our government. His character, as an officer of\r\nskill and bravery, was established on the trials of the last war, and\r\nno previous act of his life had led to doubt his fidelity. Whether the\r\nHead of the war department is equal to his charge, I am not qualified\r\nto decide. I knew him only as a pleasant, gentlemanly man in society;\r\nand the indecision of his character rather added to the amenity of his\r\nconversation. But when translated from the colloquial circle to the\r\ngreat stage of national concerns, and the direction of the extensive\r\noperations of war, whether he has been able to seize at one glance the\r\nlong line of defenceless border presented by our enemy, the masses of\r\nstrength which we hold on different points of it, the facility this\r\ngave us of attacking him, on the same day, on all his points, from the\r\nextremity of the lakes to the neighborhood of Quebec, and the perfect\r\nindifference with which this last place, impregnable as it is, might\r\nbe left in the hands of the enemy to fall of itself; whether, I say,\r\nhe could see and prepare vigorously for all this, or merely wrapped\r\nhimself in the cloak of cold defence, I am uninformed. I clearly think\r\nwith you on the competence of Monroe to embrace great views of action.\r\nThe decision of his character, his enterprise, firmness, industry, and\r\nunceasing vigilance, would, I believe, secure, as I am sure they would\r\nmerit, the public confidence, and give us all the success which our means\r\ncan accomplish. If our operations have suffered or languished from any\r\nwant of energy in the present head which directs them, I have so much\r\nconfidence in the wisdom and conscientious integrity of Mr. Madison, as\r\nto be satisfied, that however torturing to his feelings, he will fulfil\r\nhis duty to the public and to his own reputation, by making the necessary\r\nchange. Perhaps he may be preparing it while we are talking about it;\r\nfor of all these things I am uninformed. I fear that Hull's surrender\r\nhas been more than the mere loss of a year to us. Besides bringing on\r\nus the whole mass of savage nations, whom fear and not affection has\r\nkept in quiet, there is danger that in giving time to an enemy who can\r\nsend reinforcements of regulars faster than we can raise them, they\r\nmay strengthen Canada and Halifax beyond the assailment of our lax and\r\ndivided powers. Perhaps, however, the patriotic efforts from Kentucky\r\nand Ohio, by recalling the British force to its upper posts, may yet\r\ngive time to Dearborne to strike a blow below. Effectual possession of\r\nthe river from Montreal to the Chaudiere, which is practicable, would\r\ngive us the upper country at our leisure, and close forever the scenes\r\nof the tomahawk and scalping knife.\r\n\r\nBut these things are for others to plan and achieve. The only succor\r\nfrom the old must lie in their prayers. These I offer up with sincere\r\ndevotion; and in my concern for the great public, I do not overlook my\r\nfriends, but supplicate for them, as I do for yourself, a long course\r\nof freedom, happiness and prosperity.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THOMAS C. FLOURNEY, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, October 1, 1812.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your letter of August 29th is just now received, having lingered\r\nlong on the road. I owe you much thankfulness for the favorable opinion\r\nyou entertain of my services, and the assurance expressed that they would\r\nagain be acceptable in the executive chair. But, sir, I was sincere in\r\nstating age as one of the reasons of my retirement from office, beginning\r\nthen to be conscious of its effects, and now much more sensible of\r\nthem. Servile inertness is not what is to save our country; the conduct\r\nof a war requires the vigor and enterprise of younger heads. All such\r\nundertakings, therefore, are out of the question with me, and I say so\r\nwith the greater satisfaction, when I contemplate the person to whom\r\nthe executive powers were handed over. You probably do not know Mr.\r\nMadison personally, or at least intimately, as I do. I have known him\r\nfrom 1779, when he first came into the public councils, and from three\r\nand thirty years' trial, I can say conscientiously that I do not know in\r\nthe world a man of purer integrity, more dispassionate, disinterested\r\nand devoted to genuine republicanism; nor could I, in the whole scope\r\nof America and Europe, point out an abler head. He may be illy seconded\r\nby others, betrayed by the Hulls and Arnolds of our country, for such\r\nthere are in every country, and with sorrow and suffering we know it.\r\nBut what man can do will be done by Mr. Madison. I hope, therefore,\r\nthere will be no difference among republicans as to his re-election,\r\nand we shall know his value when we have to give him up, and to look at\r\nlarge for his successor. With respect to the unfortunate loss of Detroit\r\nand our army, I with pleasure see the animation it has inspired through\r\nour whole country, but especially through the Western States, and the\r\ndetermination to retrieve our loss and our honor by increased exertions.\r\nI am not without hope that the Western efforts under General Harrison,\r\nmay oblige the enemy to remain at their upper posts, and give Dearborne a\r\nfair opportunity to strike a blow below. A possession of the river from\r\nMontreal to the Chaudiere, gives us the upper country of course, and\r\ncloses forever the scenes of the tomahawk and scalping-knife. Quebec is\r\nimpregnable, but it is also worthless, and may be safely left in their\r\nhands to fall of itself. The vigorous minds and bodies of our countrymen\r\nleave me no fear as to ultimate results. In this confidence I resign\r\nmyself to the care of those whom in their younger days I assisted in\r\ntaking care of, and salute you with assurances of esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DOCTOR ROBERT PATTERSON.\r\n\r\n                                             MONTICELLO, December 27, 1812.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--After an absence of five weeks at a distant possession of mine,\r\nto which I pay such visits three or four times a year, I find here your\r\nfavor of November 30th. I am very thankful to you for the description\r\nof Redhefer's machine. I had never before been able to form an idea of\r\nwhat his principle of deception was. He is the first of the inventors\r\nof perpetual motion within my knowledge, who has had the cunning to put\r\nhis visitors on a false pursuit, by amusing them with a sham machinery\r\nwhose loose and vibratory motion might impose on them the belief that\r\nit is the real source of the motion they see. To this device he is\r\nindebted for a more extensive delusion than I have before witnessed on\r\nthis point. We are full of it as far as this State, and I know not how\r\nmuch farther. In Richmond they have done me the honor to quote me as\r\nhaving said that it was a possible thing. A poor Frenchman who called on\r\nme the other day, with another invention of perpetual motion, assured me\r\nthat Dr. Franklin, many years ago, expressed his opinion to him that it\r\nwas not impossible. Without entering into contest on this abuse of the\r\nDoctor's name, I gave him the answer I had given to others before, that\r\nthe Almighty himself could not construct a machine of perpetual motion\r\nwhile the laws exist which he has prescribed for the government of matter\r\nin our system; that the equilibrium established by him between cause\r\nand effect must be suspended to effect that purpose. But Redhefer seems\r\nto be reaping a rich harvest from the public deception. The office of\r\nscience is to instruct the ignorant. Would it be unworthy of some one of\r\nits votaries who witness this deception, to give a popular demonstration\r\nof the insufficiency of the ostensible machinery, and of course of the\r\nnecessary existence of some hidden mover? And who could do it with more\r\neffect on the public mind than yourself?\r\n\r\nI received, at the same time, the Abbé Rochon's pamphlets and book on\r\nhis application of the double refraction of the Iceland Spath to the\r\nmeasure of small angles. I was intimate with him in France, and had\r\nreceived there, in many conversations, explanations of what is contained\r\nin these sheets. I possess, too, one of his lunettes which he had given\r\nto Dr. Franklin, and which came to me through Mr. Hopkinson. You are\r\ntherefore probably acquainted with it. The graduated bar on each side\r\nis 12 inches long. The one extending to 37´ of angle, the other to\r\n3,438 diameter in distance of the object viewed. On so large a scale of\r\ngraduation, a nonias might distinctly enough sub-divide the divisions\r\nof 10´´ to 10´´ each; which is certainly a great degree of precision.\r\nBut not possessing the common micrometer of two semi-lenses, I am not\r\nable to judge of their comparative merit. * * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. ADAMS.\r\n\r\n                                             MONTICELLO, December 28, 1812.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--An absence of five or six weeks, on a journey I take three\r\nor four times a year, must apologize for my late acknowledgment of your\r\nfavor of October 12th. After getting through the mass of business which\r\ngenerally accumulates during my absence, my first attention has been\r\nbestowed on the subject of your letter. I turned to the passages you\r\nrefer to in Hutchinson and Winthrop, and with the aid of their dates, I\r\nexamined our historians to see if Wollaston's migration to this State was\r\nnoticed by them. It happens, unluckily, that Smith and Stith, who alone\r\nof them go into minute facts, bring their histories, the former only to\r\n1623, and the latter to 1624. Wollaston's arrival in Massachusetts was\r\nin 1625, and his removal to this State was \"some time\" after. Beverly &\r\nKeith, who came lower down, are nearly superficial, giving nothing but\r\nthose general facts which every one knew as well as themselves. If our\r\npublic records of that date were not among those destroyed by the British\r\non their invasion of this State, they may possibly have noticed Wollaston.\r\nWhat I possessed in this way have been given out to two gentlemen, the\r\none engaged in writing our history, the other in collecting our ancient\r\nlaws; so that none of these resources are at present accessible to me.\r\nRecollecting that Nathaniel Morton, in his New England memorial, gives\r\nwith minuteness the early annals of the colony of New Plymouth, and\r\noccasionally interweaves the occurrences of that on Massachusetts Bay, I\r\nrecurred to him, and under the year 1628, I find he notices both Wollaston\r\nand Thomas Morton, and gives with respect to both, some details which\r\nare not in Hutchinson or Winthrop. As you do not refer to him, and so\r\npossibly may not have his book, I will transcribe from it the entire\r\npassage, which will prove at least my desire to gratify your curiosity\r\nas far as the materials within my power will enable me.\r\n\r\nExtract from Nathaniel Morton's New England's Memorial, pp. 93 to 99,\r\nAnno 1628. \"Whereas, about three years before this time, there came\r\nover one Captain Wollaston,[2] a man of considerable parts, and with him\r\nthree or four more of some eminency, who brought with them a great many\r\nservants, with provisions and other requisites for to begin a plantation,\r\nand pitched themselves in a place within the Massachusetts Bay, which\r\nthey called afterwards by their captain's name, Mount Wollaston; which\r\nplace is since called by the name of Braintry. And amongst others that\r\ncame with him, there was one Mr. Thomas Morton, who, it should seem,\r\nhad some small adventure of his own of other men's amongst them, but\r\nhad little respect, and was slighted by the meanest servants they kept.\r\nThey having continued some time in New England, and not finding things\r\nto answer their expectation, nor profit to arise as they looked for, the\r\nsaid Captain Wollaston takes a great part of the servants and transports\r\nthem to Virginia, and disposed of them there, and writes back to one Mr.\r\nRasdale, one of his chief partners, (and accounted then merchant,) to\r\nbring another part of them to Virginia, likewise intending to put them\r\noff there as he had done the rest; and he, with the consent of the said\r\nRasdale, appointed one whose name was Filcher, to be his Lieutenant, and\r\nto govern the remainder of the plantation until he or Rasdale should\r\ntake further order thereabout. But the aforesaid Morton, (having more\r\ncraft than honesty,) having been a petty-fogger at Furnival's-inn, he,\r\nin the other's absence, watches an opportunity, (commons being put hard\r\namong them,) and got some strong drink and other junkets, and made them\r\na feast, and after they were merry, he began to tell them he would give\r\nthem good counsel. You see, (saith he,) that many of your fellows are\r\ncarried to Virginia, and if you stay still until Rasdale's return, you\r\nwill also be carried away and sold for slaves with the rest; therefore I\r\nwould advise you to thrust out Lieutenant Filcher, and I having a part\r\nin the plantation, will receive you as my partners and consociates, so\r\nyou may be free from service, and we will converse, plant, trade and\r\nlive together as equals (or to the like effect). This counsel was easily\r\nfollowed; so they took opportunity, and thrust Lieutenant Filcher out of\r\ndoors, and would not suffer him to come any more amongst them, but forced\r\nhim to seek bread to eat and other necessaries amongst his neighbors,\r\ntill he would get passage for England. (See the sad effect of want of\r\ngood government.)\r\n\r\n\"After this they fell to great licentiousness of life, in all\r\nprophaneness, and the said Morton became lord of misrule, and maintained\r\n(as it were) a school of Atheism, and after they had got some goods into\r\ntheir hands, and got much by trading with the Indians, they spent it as\r\nvainly, in quaffing and drinking both wine and strong liquors in great\r\nexcess, (as some have reported,) ten pounds worth in a morning, setting\r\nup a May pole, drinking and dancing about like so many fairies, or\r\nfuries rather, yea and worse practices, as if they had anew revived and\r\ncelebrated the feast of the Roman goddess Flora, or the beastly practices\r\nof the mad Bacchanalians. The said Morton likewise to show his poetry,\r\ncomposed sundry rythmes and verses, some tending to licentiousness,\r\nand others to the detraction and scandal of some persons names, which\r\nhe affixed to his idle or idol May-pole; they changed also the name of\r\ntheir place, and instead of calling it Mount Wollaston, they called it\r\nthe Merry Mount, as if this jollity would have lasted always. But this\r\ncontinued not long, for shortly after that worthy gentleman Mr. John\r\nEndicot, who brought over a patent under the broad seal of England for\r\nthe government of the Massachusetts, visiting those parts, caused that\r\nMay-pole to be cut down, and rebuked them for their prophaneness, and\r\nadmonished them to look to it that they walked better; so the name was\r\nagain changed and called Mount Dagon.\r\n\r\n\"Now to maintain this riotous prodigality and profuse expense, the said\r\nMorton thinking himself lawless, and hearing what gain the fishermen made\r\nof trading of pieces, powder, and shot, he as head of this consortship,\r\nbegan the practice of the same in these parts; and first he taught the\r\nIndians how to use them, to charge and discharge 'em, and what proportion\r\nof powder to give the piece; according to the size of bigness of the\r\nsame, and what shot to use for fowl, and what for deer; and having\r\ninstructed them, he employed some of them to hunt and fowl for him; so\r\nas they became somewhat more active in that imployment than any of the\r\nEnglish, by reason of their swiftness of foot, and nimbleness of body,\r\nbeing also quick-sighted, and by continual exercise, well knowing the\r\nhaunt of all sorts of game; so as when they saw the execution that a\r\npiece would do, and the benefit that might come by the same, they became\r\nvery eager after them, and would not stick to give any price they could\r\nattain to for them; accounting their bows and arrows but baubles in\r\ncomparison of them.\r\n\r\n\"And here we may take occasion to bewail the mischief which came by this\r\nwicked man, and others like unto him; in that notwithstanding laws for\r\nthe restraint of selling ammunition to the natives, that so far base\r\ncovetousness prevailed, and doth still prevail, as that the Salvages\r\nbecame amply furnished with guns, powder, shot, rapiers, pistols, and\r\nalso well skilled in repairing of defective arms: yea some have not\r\nspared to tell them how gunpowder is made, and all the materials in it,\r\nand they are to be had in their own land; and would (no doubt, in case\r\nthey could attain to the making of Saltpeter) teach them to make powder,\r\nand what mischief may fall out unto the English in these parts thereby,\r\nlet this pestilent fellow Morton (aforenamed) bear a great part of the\r\nblame and guilt of it to future generations. But lest I should hold the\r\nreader too long in relation to the particulars of his vile actings; when\r\nas the English that then lived up and down about the Massachusetts, and\r\nin other places, perceiving the sad consequences of his trading, so as\r\nthe Indians became furnished with the English arms and ammunition, and\r\nexpert in the improving of them, and fearing that they should at one\r\ntime or another get a blow thereby; and also taking notice, that if he\r\nwere let alone in his way, they should keep no servants for him, because\r\nhe would entertain any, how vile soever, sundry of the chief of the\r\nstraggling plantations met together, and agreed by mutual consent to\r\nsend to Plimouth, who were then of more strength to join with them, to\r\nsuppress this mischief who considering the particulars proposed to them\r\nto join together to take some speedy course to prevent (if it might be)\r\nthe evil that was accruing towards them; and resolved first to admonish\r\nhim of his wickedness respecting the premises, laying before him the\r\ninjury he did to their common safety, and that his acting considering the\r\nsame was against the King's proclamation; but he insolently persisted\r\non in his way, and said the King was dead, and his displeasure with\r\nhim, and threatened them that if they come to molest him, they should\r\nlook to themselves; so that they saw that there was no way but to take\r\nhim by force; so they resolved to proceed in such a way, and obtained\r\nof the Governor of Plimouth to send Capt. Standish and some other aid\r\nwith him, to take the said Morton by force, the which accordingly was\r\ndone; but they found him to stand stiffly on his defence, having made\r\nfast his doors, armed his consorts, set powder and shot ready upon the\r\ntable; scoffed and scorned at them, he and his complices being fitted\r\nwith strong drink, were desperate in their way; but he himself coming\r\nout of doors to make a shot at Capt. Standish, he stepping to him put\r\nby his piece and took him, and so little hurt was done; and so he was\r\nbrought prisoner to Plimouth, and continued in durance till an opportunity\r\nof sending him for England, which was done at their common charge, and\r\nletters also with him, to the honorable council for New England, and\r\nreturned again into the country in some short time, with less punishment\r\nthan his demerits deserved (as was apprehended). The year following he\r\nwas again apprehended, and sent for England, where he lay a considerable\r\ntime in Exeter gaol; for besides his miscarriage here in New England,\r\nhe was suspected to have murthered a man that had ventured monies with\r\nhim when he came first into New England; and a warrant was sent over\r\nfrom the Lord Chief Justice to apprehend him, by virtue whereof, he\r\nwas by the Governor of Massachusetts sent into England, and for other\r\nof his misdemeanors amongst them in that government, they demolished\r\nhis house, that it might no longer be a roost for such unclean birds.\r\nNotwithstanding he got free in England again, and wrote an infamous and\r\nscurrilous book against many godly and chief men of the country, full\r\nof lies and slanders, and full fraught with prophane calumnies against\r\ntheir names and persons, and the way of God. But to the intent I may\r\nnot trouble the reader any more with mentioning of him in this history;\r\nin fine, sundry years after he came again into the country, and was\r\nimprisoned at Boston for the aforesaid book and other things, but denied\r\nsundry things therein, affirming his book was adulterated. And soon after\r\nbeing grown old in wickedness, at last ended his life at Piscataqua.\r\nBut I fear I have held the reader too long about so unworthy a person,\r\nbut hope it may be useful to take notice how wickedness was beginning,\r\nand would have further proceeded, had it not been prevented timely.\"\r\n\r\nSo far Nathaniel Morton. The copy you have of Thomas Morton's New English\r\nCanaan, printed in 1637 by Stam of Amsterdam, was a second edition of\r\nthat \"infamous and scurrilous book against the godly.\" The first had been\r\nprinted in 1632, by Charles Green, in a 4to of 188 pages, and is the one\r\nalluded to by N. Morton. Both of them made a part of the American library\r\ngiven by White Kennett in 1713 to the Society for the propagation of\r\nthe Gospel in foreign parts. This society being a chartered one, still,\r\nas I believe, existing, and probably their library also, I suppose that\r\nthese and the other books of that immense collection, the catalogue of\r\nwhich occupies 275 pages 4to, are still to be found with them. If any\r\nresearch I can hereafter make should ever bring to my knowledge anything\r\nmore of Wollaston, I shall not fail to communicate it to you. Ever and\r\naffectionately yours.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n    [2] This gentleman's name is here occasionally used, and although\r\n    he came over in the year 1625, yet these passages in reference\r\n    to Morton fell out about this year, and therefore referred to\r\n    this place.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HENRY MIDDLETON, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, January 8, 1813.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of November 25th was a month on its passage to me.\r\nI received with great pleasure this mark of your recollection, heightened\r\nby the assurance that the part I have acted in public life has met your\r\napprobation. Having seen the people of all other nations bowed down\r\nto the earth under the wars and prodigalities of their rulers, I have\r\ncherished their opposites, peace, economy, and riddance of public debt,\r\nbelieving that these were the high road to public as well as to private\r\nprosperity and happiness. And, certainly, there never before has been a\r\nstate of the world in which such forbearances as we have exercised would\r\nnot have preserved our peace. Nothing but the total prostration of all\r\nmoral principle could have produced the enormities which have forced us\r\nat length into the war. On one hand, a ruthless tyrant, drenching Europe\r\nin blood to obtain through future time the character of the destroyer\r\nof mankind; on the other, a nation of buccanniers, urged by sordid\r\navarice, and embarked in the flagitious enterprise of seizing to itself\r\nthe maritime resources and rights of all other nations, have left no\r\nmeans of peace to reason and moderation. And yet there are beings among\r\nus who think we ought still to have acquiesced. As if while full war was\r\nwaging on one side, we could lose by making some reprisal on the other.\r\nThe paper you were so kind as to enclose me is a proof you are not of\r\nthis sentiment; it expresses our grievances with energy and brevity,\r\nas well as the feelings they ought to excite. And I see with pleasure\r\nanother proof that South Carolina is ever true to the principles of\r\nfree government. Indeed it seems to me that in proportion as commercial\r\navarice and corruption advance on us from the north and east, the\r\nprinciples of free government are to retire to the agricultural states\r\nof the south and west, as their last asylum and bulwark. With honesty\r\nand self-government for her portion, agriculture may abandon contentedly\r\nto others the fruits of commerce and corruption. Accept, I pray you,\r\nthe assurances of my great esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. RONALDSON.\r\n\r\n                                                 MONTICELLO, Jan. 12, 1813.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of November 2d arrived a little before I sat out\r\non a journey on which I was absent between five and six weeks. I have\r\nstill therefore to return you my thanks for the seeds accompanying it,\r\nwhich shall be duly taken care of, and a communication made to others\r\nof such as shall prove valuable. I have been long endeavoring to procure\r\nthe Cork tree from Europe, but without success. A plant which I brought\r\nwith me from Paris died after languishing some time, and of several\r\nparcels of acorns received from a correspondent at Marseilles, not one\r\nhas ever vegetated. I shall continue my endeavors, although disheartened\r\nby the nonchalance of our southern fellow citizens, with whom alone they\r\ncan thrive. It is now twenty-five years since I sent them two shipments\r\n(about 500 plants) of the Olive tree of Aix, the finest Olives in the\r\nworld. If any of them still exist, it is merely as a curiosity in their\r\ngardens, not a single orchard of them has been planted. I sent them also\r\nthe celebrated species of Sainfoin,[3] from Malta, which yields good\r\ncrops without a drop of rain through the season. It was lost. The upland\r\nrice which I procured fresh from Africa and sent them, has been preserved\r\nand spread in the upper parts of Georgia, and I believe in Kentucky.\r\nBut we must acknowledge their services in furnishing us an abundance\r\nof cotton, a substitute for silk, flax and hemp. The ease with which it\r\nis spun will occasion it to supplant the two last, and its cleanliness\r\nthe first. Household manufacture is taking deep root with us. I have a\r\ncarding machine, two spinning machines, and looms with the flying shuttle\r\nin full operation for clothing my own family; and I verily believe that\r\nby the next winter this State will not need a yard of imported coarse or\r\nmiddling clothing. I think we have already a sheep for every inhabitant,\r\nwhich will suffice for clothing, and one-third more, which a single year\r\nwill add, will furnish blanketing. With respect to marine hospitals, which\r\nare one of the subjects of your letter, I presume you know that such\r\nestablishments have been made by the general government in the several\r\nStates, that a portion of seaman's wages is drawn for their support, and\r\nthe government furnishes what is deficient. Mr. Gallatin is attentive to\r\nthem, and they will grow with our growth. You doubt whether we ought to\r\npermit the exportation of grain to our enemies; but Great Britain, with\r\nher own agricultural support, and those she can command by her access\r\ninto every sea, cannot be starved by withholding our supplies. And if\r\nshe is to be fed at all events, why may we not have the benefit of it\r\nas well as others? I would not, indeed, feed her armies landed on our\r\nterritory, because the difficulty of inland subsistence is what will\r\nprevent their ever penetrating far into the country, and will confine\r\nthem to the sea coast. But this would be my only exception. And as to\r\nfeeding her armies in the peninsula, she is fighting our battles there,\r\nas Bonaparte is on the Baltic. He is shutting out her manufactures from\r\nthat sea, and so far assisting us in her reduction to extremity. But if\r\nshe does not keep him out of the peninsular, if he gets full command of\r\nthat, instead of the greatest and surest of all our markets, as that\r\nhas uniformly been, we shall be excluded from it, or so much shackled\r\nby his tyranny and ignorant caprices, that it will become for us what\r\nFrance now is. Besides, if we could, by starving the English armies,\r\noblige them to withdraw from the peninsular, it would be to send them\r\nhere; and I think we had better feed them there for pay, than feed and\r\nfight them here for nothing. A truth, too, not to be lost sight of is,\r\nthat no country can pay war taxes if you suppress all their resources.\r\nTo keep the war popular, we must keep open the markets. As long as good\r\nprices can be had, the people will support the war cheerfully. If you\r\nshould have an opportunity of conveying to Mr. Heriot my thanks for his\r\nbook, you will oblige me by doing it. Accept the assurance of my great\r\nesteem and respect.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n    [3] Called Sulla.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. MELISH.\r\n\r\n                                              MONTICELLO, January 13, 1813.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I received duly your favor of December the 15th, and with it\r\nthe copies of your map and travels, for which be pleased to accept my\r\nthanks. The book I have read with extreme satisfaction and information.\r\nAs to the western States, particularly, it has greatly edified me; for of\r\nthe actual condition of that interesting portion of our country, I had\r\nnot an adequate idea. I feel myself now as familiar with it as with the\r\ncondition of the maritime States. I had no conception that manufactures\r\nhad made such progress there, and particularly of the number of carding\r\nand spinning machines dispersed through the whole country. We are but\r\nbeginning here to have them in our private families. Small spinning\r\njennies of from half a dozen to twenty spindles, will soon, however, make\r\ntheir way into the humblest cottages, as well as the richest houses; and\r\nnothing is more certain, than that the coarse and middling clothing for\r\nour families, will forever hereafter continue to be made within ourselves.\r\nI have hitherto myself depended entirely on foreign manufactures; but\r\nI have now thirty-five spindles agoing, a hand carding machine, and\r\nlooms with the flying shuttle, for the supply of my own farms, which\r\nwill never be relinquished in my time. The continuance of the war will\r\nfix the habit generally, and out of the evils of impressment and of the\r\norders of council, a great blessing for us will grow. I have not formerly\r\nbeen an advocate for great manufactories. I doubted whether our labor,\r\nemployed in agriculture, and aided by the spontaneous energies of the\r\nearth, would not procure us more than we could make ourselves of other\r\nnecessaries. But other considerations entering into the question, have\r\nsettled my doubts.\r\n\r\nThe candor with which you have viewed the manners and condition of our\r\ncitizens, is so unlike the narrow prejudices of the French and English\r\ntravellers preceding you, who, considering each the manners and habits of\r\ntheir own people as the only orthodox, have viewed everything differing\r\nfrom that test as boorish and barbarous, that your work will be read\r\nhere extensively, and operate great good.\r\n\r\nAmidst this mass of approbation which is given to every other part of\r\nthe work, there is a single sentiment which I cannot help wishing to\r\nbring to what I think the correct one; and, on a point so interesting,\r\nI value your opinion too highly not to ambition its concurrence with my\r\nown. Stating in volume one, page sixty-three, the principle of difference\r\nbetween the two great political parties here, you conclude it to be,\r\n'whether the controlling power shall be vested in this or that set of\r\nmen.' That each party endeavors to get into the administration of the\r\ngovernment, and exclude the other from power, is true, and may be stated\r\nas a motive of action: but this is only secondary; the primary motive\r\nbeing a real and radical difference of political principle. I sincerely\r\nwish our differences were but personally who should govern, and that the\r\nprinciples of our constitution were those of both parties. Unfortunately,\r\nit is otherwise; and the question of preference between monarchy and\r\nrepublicanism, which has so long divided mankind elsewhere, threatens\r\na permanent division here.\r\n\r\nAmong that section of our citizens called federalists, there are three\r\nshades of opinion. Distinguishing between the _leaders_ and _people_\r\nwho compose it, the _leaders_ consider the English constitution as\r\na model of perfection, some, with a correction of its vices, others,\r\nwith all its corruptions and abuses. This last was Alexander Hamilton's\r\nopinion, which others, as well as myself, have often heard him declare,\r\nand that a correction of what are called its vices, would render the\r\nEnglish an impracticable government. This government they wished to have\r\nestablished here, and only accepted and held fast, _at first_, to the\r\npresent constitution, as a stepping-stone to the final establishment of\r\ntheir favorite model. This party has therefore always clung to England\r\nas their prototype, and great auxiliary in promoting and effecting this\r\nchange. A weighty minority, however, of these _leaders_, considering the\r\nvoluntary conversion of our government into a monarchy as too distant,\r\nif not desperate, wish to break off from our Union its eastern fragment,\r\nas being, in truth, the hot-bed of American monarchism, with a view to a\r\ncommencement of their favorite government, from whence the other States\r\nmay gangrene by degrees, and the whole be thus brought finally to the\r\ndesired point. For Massachusetts, the prime mover in this enterprise, is\r\nthe last State in the Union to mean a _final_ separation, as being of all\r\nthe most dependent on the others. Not raising bread for the sustenance of\r\nher own inhabitants, not having a stick of timber for the construction\r\nof vessels, her principal occupation, nor an article to export in them,\r\nwhere would she be, excluded from the ports of the other States, and\r\nthrown into dependence on England, her direct, and natural, but now\r\ninsidious rival? At the head of this MINORITY is what is called the Essex\r\nJunto of Massachusetts. But the MAJORITY of these _leaders_ do not aim\r\nat separation. In this, they adhere to the known principle of General\r\nHamilton, never, under any views, to break the Union. Anglomany, monarchy,\r\nand separation, then, are the principles of the Essex federalists.\r\nAnglomany and monarchy, those of the Hamiltonians, and Anglomany alone,\r\nthat of the portion among the _people_ who call themselves federalists.\r\nThese last are as good republicans as the brethren whom they oppose, and\r\ndiffer from them only in their devotion to England and hatred of France\r\nwhich they have imbibed from their leaders. The moment that these leaders\r\nshould avowedly propose a separation of the Union, or the establishment\r\nof regal government, their popular adherents would quit them to a man,\r\nand join the republican standard; and the partisans of this change, even\r\nin Massachusetts, would thus find themselves an army of officers without\r\na soldier.\r\n\r\nThe party called republican is steadily for the support of the present\r\nconstitution. They obtained at its commencement, all the amendments\r\nto it they desired. These reconciled them to it perfectly, and if they\r\nhave any ulterior view, it is only, perhaps, to popularize it further,\r\nby shortening the Senatorial term, and devising a process for the\r\nresponsibility of judges, more practicable than that of impeachment.\r\nThey esteem the people of England and France equally, and equally detest\r\nthe governing powers of both.\r\n\r\nThis I verily believe, after an intimacy of forty years with the public\r\ncouncils and characters, is a true statement of the grounds on which\r\nthey are at present divided, and that it is not merely an ambition for\r\npower. An honest man can feel no pleasure in the exercise of power over\r\nhis fellow citizens. And considering as the only offices of power those\r\nconferred by the people directly, that is to say, the executive and\r\nlegislative functions of the General and State governments, the common\r\nrefusal of these, and multiplied resignations, are proofs sufficient\r\nthat power is not alluring to pure minds, and is not, with them, the\r\nprimary principle of contest. This is my belief of it; it is that\r\non which I have acted; and had it been a mere contest who should be\r\npermitted to administer the government according to its genuine republican\r\nprinciples, there has never been a moment of my life in which I should\r\nhave relinquished for it the enjoyments of my family, my farm, my friends\r\nand books.\r\n\r\nYou expected to discover the difference of our party principles in General\r\nWashington's valedictory, and my inaugural address. Not at all. General\r\nWashington did not harbor one principle of federalism. He was neither\r\nan Angloman, a monarchist, nor a separatist. He sincerely wished the\r\npeople to have as much self-government as they were competent to exercise\r\nthemselves. The only point on which he and I ever differed in opinion,\r\nwas, that I had more confidence than he had in the natural integrity and\r\ndiscretion of the people, and in the safety and extent to which they\r\nmight trust themselves with a control over their government. He has\r\nasseverated to me a thousand times his determination that the existing\r\ngovernment should have a fair trial, and that in support of it he would\r\nspend the last drop of his blood. He did this the more repeatedly, because\r\nhe knew General Hamilton's political bias, and my apprehensions from\r\nit. It is a mere calumny, therefore, in the monarchists, to associate\r\nGeneral Washington with their principles. But that may have happened\r\nin this case which has been often seen in ordinary cases, that, by oft\r\nrepeating an untruth, men come to believe it themselves. It is a mere\r\nartifice in this party to bolster themselves up on the revered name of\r\nthat first of our worthies. If I have dwelt longer on this subject than\r\nwas necessary, it proves the estimation in which I hold your ultimate\r\nopinions, and my desire of placing the subject truly before them. In so\r\ndoing, I am certain I risk no use of the communication which may draw\r\nme into contention before the public. Tranquillity is the _summum bonum_\r\nof a Septagenaire.\r\n\r\nTo return to the merits of your work: I consider it as so lively a\r\npicture of the real state of our country, that if I can possibly obtain\r\nopportunities of conveyance, I propose to send a copy to a friend\r\nin France, and another to one in Italy, who, I know, will translate\r\nand circulate it as an antidote to the misrepresentations of former\r\ntravellers. But whatever effect my profession of political faith may\r\nhave on your general opinion, a part of my object will be obtained, if\r\nit satisfies you as to the principles of my own action, and of the high\r\nrespect and consideration with which I tender you my salutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL DUANE.\r\n\r\n                                              MONTICELLO, January 22, 1813.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I do not know how the publication of the Review turned out\r\nin point of profit, whether gainfully or not. I know it ought to have\r\nbeen a book of great sale. I gave a copy to a student of William and\r\nMary college, and recommended it to Bishop Madison, then President of\r\nthe college, who was so pleased with it that he established it as a\r\nschool-book, and as the young gentleman informed me, every copy which\r\ncould be had was immediately bought up, and there was a considerable\r\ndemand for more. You probably know best whether new calls for it have\r\nbeen made. Pr. Madison was a good whig. * * * * * Your experiment on that\r\nwork will enable you to decide whether you ought to undertake another,\r\nnot of greater but of equal merit. I have received from France a MS. work\r\non Political Economy, written by De Tutt Tracy, the most conspicuous\r\nwriter of the present day in the metaphysical line. He has written a\r\nwork entitled Ideology, which has given him a high reputation in France.\r\nHe considers that as having laid a solid foundation for the present\r\nvolume on Political Economy, and will follow it by one on Moral Duties.\r\nThe present volume is a work of great ability. It may be considered as\r\na review of the principles of the Economists, of Smith and of Say, or\r\nrather an elementary book on the same subject. As Smith had corrected\r\nsome principles of the Economists, and Say some of Smiths, so Tracy has\r\ndone as to the whole. He has, in my opinion, corrected fundamental errors\r\nin all of them, and by simplifying principles, has brought the subject\r\nwithin a narrow compass. I think the volume would be of about the size\r\nof the Review of Montesquieu. Although he puts his name to the work, he\r\nis afraid to publish it in France, lest its freedom should bring him\r\ninto trouble. If translated and published here, he could disavow it,\r\nif necessary. In order to enable you to form a better judgment of the\r\nwork, I will subjoin a list of the chapters or heads, and if you think\r\nproper to undertake the translation and publication, I will send the\r\nwork itself. You will certainly find it one of the very first order. It\r\nbegins with * * * * *\r\n\r\nOur war on the land has commenced most inauspiciously. I fear we are\r\nto expect reverses until we can find out who are qualified for command,\r\nand until these can learn their profession. The proof of a general, to\r\nknow whether he will stand fire, costs a more serious price than that\r\nof a cannon; these proofs have already cost us thousands of good men,\r\nand deplorable degradation of reputation, and as yet have elicited but\r\na few negative and a few positive characters. But we must persevere till\r\nwe recover the rank we are entitled to.\r\n\r\nAccept the assurances of my continued esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DOCTOR MORRELL.\r\n\r\n                                              MONTICELLO, February 5, 1813.\r\n\r\nSIR,--The book which you were so kind as to take charge of at Paris for\r\nme, is safely received, and I thank you for your care of it, and more\r\nparticularly for the indulgent sentiments you are so kind as to express\r\ntowards myself. I am happy at all times to hear of the welfare of my\r\nliterary friends in that country; they have had a hard time of it since\r\nI left them. I know nothing which can so severely try the heart and\r\nspirit of man, and especially of the man of science, as the necessity of\r\na passive acquiescence under the abominations of an unprincipled tyrant\r\nwho is deluging the earth with blood to acquire for himself the reputation\r\nof a Cartouche or a Robin Hood. The petty larcenies of the Blackbeards\r\nand Buccaneers of the ocean, the more immediately exercised on us, are\r\ndirty and grovelling things addressed to our contempt, while the horrors\r\nexcited by the Scelerat of France are beyond all human execrations. With\r\nmy thanks for your kind attentions, be pleased to accept the assurance\r\nof my respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL BAILEY.\r\n\r\n                                              MONTICELLO, February 6, 1813.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of January 25th is received, and I have to renew\r\nmy thanks to you for the map accompanying it. These proofs of friendly\r\nremembrance give additional interest to the subjects which convey them.\r\nThe scenes, too, which compose the map, are become highly interesting.\r\nOur first entrance on them has been peculiarly inauspicious. Our men\r\nare good, but force without conduct is easily baffled. The Creator has\r\nnot thought proper to mark those in the forehead who are of stuff to\r\nmake good generals. We are first, therefore, to seek them blindfold,\r\nand then let them learn the trade at the expense of great losses. But\r\nour turn of success will come by-and-bye, and we must submit to the\r\nprevious misfortunes which are to be the price of it. I think with you\r\non the subject of privateers. Our ships of force will undoubtedly be\r\nblockaded by the enemy, and we shall have no means of annoying them at\r\nsea but by small, swift-sailing vessels; these will be better managed and\r\nmore multiplied in the hands of individuals than of the government. In\r\nshort, they are our true and only weapon in a war against Great Britain,\r\nwhen once Canada and Nova Scotia shall have been rescued from them. The\r\nopposition to them in Congress is merely partial. It is a part of the navy\r\nfever, and proceeds from the desire of securing men for the public ships\r\nby suppressing all other employments from them. But I do not apprehend\r\nthat this ill-judged principle is that of a majority of Congress. I\r\nhope, on the contrary, they will spare no encouragement to that kind of\r\nenterprise. Our public ships, to be sure, have done wonders. They have\r\nsaved our military reputation sacrificed on the shores of Canada; but\r\nin point of real injury and depredation on the enemy, our privateers\r\nwithout question have been most effectual. Both species of force have\r\ntheir peculiar value. I salute you with assurances of friendship and\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n                                              MONTICELLO, February 8, 1813.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of the 27th ult. has been duly received. You have\r\nhad a long holiday from my intrusions. In truth I have had nothing to\r\nwrite about, and your time should not be consumed by letters about\r\nnothing. The enclosed paper however makes it a duty to give you the\r\ntrouble of reading it. You know the handwriting and the faith due to\r\nit. Our intimacy with the writer leaves no doubt about his facts, and\r\nin his letter to me he pledges himself for their fidelity. He says the\r\nnarrative was written at the request of a young friend in Virginia, and\r\na copy made for my perusal, on the presumption it would be interesting\r\nto me. Whether the word \"Confidential\" at the head of the paper was\r\nmeant only for his young friend or for myself also, nothing in his\r\nletter indicates. I must, therefore, govern myself by considerations of\r\ndiscretion and of duty combined. Discretion dictates that I ought not so\r\nto use the paper as to compromit my friend; an effect which would be as\r\nfatal to my peace as it might be to his person. But duty tells me that\r\nthe public interest is so deeply concerned in your perfect knowledge\r\nof the characters employed in its high stations, that nothing should\r\nbe withheld which can give you useful information. On these grounds I\r\ncommit it to yourself and the Secretary at War, to whose functions it\r\nrelates more immediately. It may have effect on your future designation\r\nof those to whom particular enterprises are to be committed, and this\r\nis the object of the communication. If you should think it necessary\r\nthat the minds of the other members of the Cabinet should be equally\r\napprized of its contents, although not immediately respecting their\r\ndepartments, the same considerations, and an entire confidence in them\r\npersonally, would dictate its communication to them also. But beyond\r\nthis no sense of duty calls on me for its disclosure, and fidelity to\r\nmy friend strongly forbids it. The paper presents such a picture of\r\nindecision in purpose, inattention to preparation, and imprudence of\r\ndemeanor, as to fix a total incompetence for military direction. How\r\ngreatly we were deceived in this character, as is generally the case in\r\nappointments not on our own knowledge. I remember when we appointed him\r\nwe rejoiced in the acquisition of an officer of so much understanding\r\nand integrity, as we imputed to him; and placed him as near the head of\r\nthe army as the commands then at our disposal admitted. Perhaps, still,\r\nyou may possess information giving a different aspect to this case, of\r\nwhich I sincerely wish it may be susceptible. I will ask the return of\r\nthe paper when no longer useful to you.\r\n\r\nThe accession to your Cabinet meets general approbation. This is chiefly\r\nat present given to the character most known, but will be equally so\r\nto the other when better known. I think you could not have made better\r\nappointments.\r\n\r\nThe autumn and winter have been most unfriendly to the wheat in red\r\nlands, by continued cold and alternate frosts and thaws. The late snow\r\nof about ten inches now disappearing, have received it. That grain is\r\ngot to $2 at Richmond. This is the true barometer of the popularity of\r\nthe war. Ever affectionately yours.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL ARMSTRONG.\r\n\r\n                                              MONTICELLO, February 8, 1813.\r\n\r\nDEAR GENERAL,--I have long ago in my heart congratulated our country on\r\nyour call to the place you now occupy. But with yourself personally it\r\nis no subject of congratulation. The happiness of the domestic fireside\r\nis the first boon of heaven; and it is well it is so, since it is that\r\nwhich is the lot of the mass of mankind. The duties of office are a\r\nCorvée which must be undertaken on far other considerations than those\r\nof personal happiness. But whether this be a subject of congratulation\r\nor of condolence, it furnishes the occasion of recalling myself to your\r\nrecollection, and of renewing the assurances of my friendship and respect.\r\nWhatever you do in office, I know will be honestly and ably done, and\r\nalthough we who do not see the whole ground may sometimes impute error,\r\nit will be because we, not you, are in the wrong; or because your views\r\nare defeated by the wickedness or incompetence of those you are obliged\r\nto trust with their execution. An instance of this is the immediate cause\r\nof the present letter. I have enclosed a paper to the President, with\r\na request to communicate it to you, and if he thinks it should be known\r\nto your associates of the Cabinet, although not immediately respecting\r\ntheir departments, he will communicate it to them also. That it should\r\ngo no further is rendered an obligation on me by considerations personal\r\nto a young friend whom I love and value, and by the confidence which has\r\ninduced him to commit himself to me. I hope, therefore, it will never\r\nbe known that such a narrative has been written, and much less by whom\r\nwritten, and to whom addressed. It is unfortunate that heaven has not set\r\nits stamp on the forehead of those whom it has qualified for military\r\nachievement. That it has left us to draw for them in a lottery of so\r\nmany blanks to a prize, and where the blank is to be manifested only\r\nby the public misfortunes. If nature had planted the _fœnum in cornu_\r\non the front of treachery, of cowardice, of imbecility, the unfortunate\r\ndebut we have made on the theatre of war would not have sunk our spirits\r\nat home, and our character abroad. I hope you will be ready to act on\r\nthe first breaking of the ice, as otherwise we may despair of wresting\r\nCanada from our enemies. Their starving manufactories can furnish men\r\nfor its defence much faster than we can enlist them for its assault.\r\n\r\nAccept my prayers for success in all your undertakings, and the assurance\r\nof my affectionate esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DOCTOR RUSH.\r\n\r\n                                                 MONTICELLO, March 6, 1813.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I received some time ago a letter signed \"James Carver,\"\r\nproposing that myself, and my friends in this quarter, should subscribe\r\nand forward a sum of money towards the expenses of his voyage to London,\r\nand maintenance there while going through a course of education in their\r\nVeterinary school, with a view to his returning to America, and practising\r\nthe art in Philadelphia. The name, person and character of the writer,\r\nwere equally unknown to me, and unauthenticated, but as self-declared\r\nin the letter. I supposed him an Englishman, from the style in which\r\nhe spoke of \"His Majesty,\" and because an American, without offence to\r\nthe laws, could not now be going, nor be sent by private individuals to\r\nEngland. The scheme did not appear to me either the shortest or surest\r\nway of going to work to accomplish the object. Because, if the Veterinary\r\ninstitution there be of the celebrity he described, it must already have\r\nproduced subjects prepared for entering into practice, and disposed to\r\ncome to a good position, claiming nothing till they should enter into\r\nfunction, or not more than their passage. I did not receive the letter\r\nuntil the day had elapsed on which the vessel was to depart wherein he\r\nhad taken his passage; and his desire that the answer should go through\r\nyou, is my only authority for troubling you with this, addressed to you,\r\nwhom I know, love, and revere, and not to him, who, for any evidence I\r\nhave but from himself, may be a zealous son of science, or an adventurer\r\nwanting money to carry him to London. I know nothing of the Veterinary\r\ninstitution of London, yet have no doubt it merits the high character he\r\nascribes to it. It is a nation which possesses many learned men. I know\r\nwell the Veterinary school of Paris, of long standing, and saw many of its\r\npublications during my residence there. They were classically written,\r\nannounced a want of nothing but certainty as to their facts, which\r\ngranted, the hypotheses were learned and plausible. The coach-horses of\r\nthe rich of Paris were availed of the institution; but the farmers even\r\nof the neighborhood could not afford to call a Veterinary Doctor to their\r\nplough-horses in the country, or to send them to a livery stable to be\r\nattended in the city. On the whole, I was not a convert to the utility\r\nof the Institution. You know I am so to that of medicine, even in human\r\ncomplaints, but in a limited degree. That there are certain diseases of\r\nthe human body, so distinctly pronounced by well-articulated symptoms,\r\nand recurring so often, as not to be mistaken, wherein experience has\r\nproved that certain substances applied, will restore order, I cannot\r\ndoubt. Such are Kinkina in Intermittents, Mercury in Syphilis, Castor\r\nOil in Dysentery, &c. And so far I go with the physicians. But there\r\nare also a great mass of indistinct diseases, presenting themselves\r\nunder no form clearly characterized, nor exactly recognized as having\r\noccurred before, and to which of course the application of no particular\r\nsubstance can be known to have been made, nor its effect on the case\r\nexperienced. These may be called unknown cases, and they may in time be\r\nlessened by the progress of observation and experiment. Observing that\r\nthere are in the construction of the animal system some means provided\r\nunknown to us, which have a tendency to restore order, when disturbed\r\nby accident, called by physicians the _vis medicatrix naturæ_, I think\r\nit safer to trust to this power in the unknown cases, than to uncertain\r\nconjectures built on the ever-changing hypothetical systems of medicine.\r\nNow, in the Veterinary department all are unknown cases. Man can tell\r\nhis physician the seat of his pain, its nature, history, and sometimes\r\nits cause, and can follow his directions for the curative process--but\r\nthe poor dumb horse cannot signify where his pain is, what it is, or when\r\nor whence it came, and resists all process for its cure. If in the case\r\nof man, then, the benefit of medical interference in such cases admits\r\nof question, what must it be in that of the horse? And to what narrow\r\nlimits is the real importance of the Veterinary art reduced? When a boy,\r\nI knew a Doctor Seymour, neighbor to our famous botanist Clayton, who\r\nimagined he could cure the diseases of his tobacco plants; he bled some,\r\nadministered lotions to others, sprinkled powders on a third class, and\r\nso on--they only withered and perished the faster. I am sensible of the\r\npresumption of hazarding an opinion to you on a subject whereon you are\r\nso much better qualified for decision, both by reading and experience.\r\nBut our opinions are not voluntary. Every man's own reason must be his\r\noracle. And I only express mine to explain why I did not comply with\r\nMr. Carver's request; and to give you a further proof that there are no\r\nbounds to my confidence in your indulgence in matters of opinion.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams and myself are in habitual correspondence. I owe him a letter\r\nat this time, and shall pay the debt as soon as I have something to write\r\nabout: for with the commonplace topic of politics we do not meddle. Where\r\nthere are so many others on which we agree, why should we introduce\r\nthe only one on which we differ. Besides the pleasure which our naval\r\nsuccesses have given to every honest patriot, his must be peculiar,\r\nbecause a navy has always been his hobby-horse. A little further time will\r\nshow whether his ideas have been premature, and whether the little we\r\ncan oppose on that element to the omnipotence of our enemy there, would\r\nlessen the losses of the war, or contribute to shorten its duration,\r\nthe legitimate object of every measure. On the land, indeed, we have\r\nbeen most unfortunate; so wretched a succession of generals never before\r\ndestroyed the fairest expectations of a nation, counting on the bravery\r\nof its citizens, which has proved itself on all these trials. Our first\r\nobject must now be the vindication of our character in the field; after\r\nthat, peace with the _liberum mare_, personal inviolability there, and\r\nouster from this continent of the incendiaries of savages. God send us\r\nthese good things, and to you health and life here, till you wish to\r\nawake to it in another state of being.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. DE LOMERIE.\r\n\r\n                                                 MONTICELLO, April 3, 1813.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your letter of the 26th has been received, as had been that of the\r\n5th. The preceding ones had been complied with by applications verbal\r\nand written to the members of the government, to which I could expect\r\nno specific answers, their whole time being due to the public, and\r\nemployed on their concerns. Had it been my good fortune to preserve at\r\nthe age of seventy, all the activity of body and mind which I enjoyed\r\nin earlier life, I should have employed it now, as then, in incessant\r\nlabors to serve those to whom I could be useful. But the torpor of age\r\nis weighing heavily on me. The writing table is become my aversion,\r\nand its drudgeries beyond my remaining powers. I have retired, then,\r\nof necessity, from all correspondence not indispensably called for by\r\nsome special duty, and I hope that this necessity will excuse me with\r\nyou from further interference in obtaining your passage to France, which\r\nrequires solicitations and exertions beyond what I am able to encounter.\r\nI request this the more freely, because I am sure of finding, in your\r\ncandor and consideration, an acquiescence in the reasonableness of my\r\ndesire to indulge the feeble remains of life in that state of ease and\r\ntranquillity which my condition, physical and moral, require. Accept,\r\nthen, with my adieux, my best wishes for a safe and happy return to your\r\nnative country, and the assurances of my respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. THOMAS PAINE M'MATRON.\r\n\r\n                                                 MONTICELLO, April 3, 1813.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your favor of March 24th is received, and nothing could have been\r\nso pleasing to me as to have been able to comply wit the request therein\r\nmade, feeling especial motives to become useful to any person connected\r\nwith Mr. M'Matron. But I shall state to you the circumstances which\r\ncontrol my will, and rest on your candor their just estimate. When I\r\nretired from the government four years ago, it was extremely my wish to\r\nwithdraw myself from all concern with public affairs, and to enjoy with\r\nmy fellow citizens the protection of government, under the auspices and\r\ndirection of those to whom it was so worthily committed. Solicitations\r\nfrom my friends, however, to aid them in their applications for office,\r\ndrew from me an unwary compliance, till at length these became so\r\nnumerous as to occupy a great portion of my time in writing letters to\r\nthe President and heads of departments, and although these were attended\r\nto by them with great indulgence, yet I was sensible they could not fail\r\nof being very embarrassing. They kept me, at the same time, standing\r\nforever in the attitude of a suppliant before them, daily asking favors\r\nas humiliating and afflicting to my own mind, as they were unreasonable\r\nfrom their multitude. I was long sensible of the necessity of putting\r\nan end to these unceasing importunities, when a change in the heads of\r\nthe two departments to which they were chiefly addressed, presented me\r\nan opportunity. I came to a resolution, therefore, on that change, never\r\nto make another application. I have adhered to it strictly, and find\r\nthat on its rigid observance, my own happiness and the friendship of\r\nthe government too much depend, for me to swerve from it in future. On\r\nconsideration of these circumstances, I hope you will be sensible how\r\nmuch they import, both to the government and myself; and that you do\r\nme the justice to be assured of the reluctance with which I decline an\r\nopportunity of being useful to one so nearly connected with Mr. M'Matron,\r\nand that with the assurance of my regrets, you will accept that of my\r\nbest wishes for your success, and of my great respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL DUANE.\r\n\r\n                                                 MONTICELLO, April 4, 1813.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of February 14th has been duly received, and the\r\nMS. of the commentary on Montesquieu is also safe at hand. I now forward\r\nto you the work of Tracy, which you will find a valuable supplement and\r\ncorrective to those we already possess on political economy. It is a\r\nlittle unlucky that its outset is of a metaphysical character, which may\r\ndamp the ardor of perusal in some readers. He has been led to this by a\r\ndesire to embody this work, as well as a future one he is preparing on\r\nmorals, with his former treatise on Ideology. By-the-bye, it is merely to\r\nthis work that Bonaparte alludes in his answer to his Council of State,\r\npublished not long since, in which he scouts \"the dark and metaphysical\r\ndoctrine of Ideology, which, diving into first causes, founds on this\r\nbasis a legislation of the people, &c.\" If, indeed, this answer be not\r\na forgery, for everything is now forged, even to the fat of our beef\r\nand mutton: yet the speech is not unlike him, and affords scope for an\r\nexcellent parody. I wish you may succeed in getting the commentary on\r\nMontesquieu reviewed by the Edinburgh Reviewers. I should expect from\r\nthem an able and favorable analysis of it. I sent a copy of it to a\r\nfriend in England, in the hope he would communicate it to them; not,\r\nhowever, expressing that hope, lest the source of it should have been\r\nmade known. But the book will make its way, and will become a standard\r\nwork. A copy which I sent to France was under translation by one of the\r\nablest men of that country.\r\n\r\nIt is true that I am tired of practical politics, and happier while\r\nreading the history of ancient than of modern times. The total banishment\r\nof all moral principle from the code which governs the intercourse of\r\nnations, the melancholy reflection that after the mean, wicked and\r\ncowardly cunning of the cabinets of the age of Machiavel had given\r\nplace to the integrity and good faith which dignified the succeeding\r\none of a Chatham and Turgot, that this is to be swept away again by the\r\ndaring profligacy and avowed destitution of all moral principle of a\r\nCartouche and a Blackbeard, sickens my soul unto death. I turn from the\r\ncontemplation with loathing, and take refuge in the histories of other\r\ntimes, where, if they also furnished their Tarquins, their Catalines and\r\nCaligulas, their stories are handed to us under the brand of a Livy, a\r\nSallust and a Tacitus, and we are comforted with the reflection that the\r\ncondemnation of all succeeding generations has confirmed the censures\r\nof the historian, and consigned their memories to everlasting infamy, a\r\nsolace we cannot have with the Georges and Napoleons but by anticipation.\r\n\r\nIn surveying the scenes of which we make a part, I confess that three\r\nfrigates taken by our gallant little navy, do not balance in my mind\r\nthree armies lost by the treachery, cowardice, or incapacity of those\r\nto whom they were intrusted. I see that our men are good, and only want\r\ngenerals. We may yet hope, however, that the talents which always exist\r\namong men will show themselves with opportunity, and that it will be\r\nfound that this age also can produce able and honest defenders of their\r\ncountry, at what further expense, however, of blood and treasure, is yet\r\nto be seen. Perhaps this Russian mediation may cut short the history\r\nof the present war, and leave to us the laurels of the sea, while our\r\nenemies are bedecked with those of the land. This would be the reverse\r\nof what has been expected, and perhaps of what was to be wished.\r\n\r\nI have never seen the work on Political Economy, of which you speak. Say\r\nand Tracy contain the sum of that science as far as it has been soundly\r\ntraced in my judgment. And it is a pity that Say's work should not, as\r\nwell as Tracy's, be made known to our countrymen by a good translation.\r\nIt would supplant Smith's book altogether, because shorter, clearer and\r\nsounder.\r\n\r\nAccept my friendly salutations and assurances of continued esteem and\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n                                                  MONTICELLO, May 21, 1813.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--The enclosed letter from Whit was unquestionably intended for\r\nyou. The subject, the address, both of title and place, prove it, and\r\nthe mistake of the name only shows the writer to be a very uninquisitive\r\nstatesman. Dr. Waterhouse's letter, too, was intended for your eye,\r\nand although the immediate object fails by previous appointment, yet\r\nhe seems to entertain further wishes. I enclose, too, the newspapers\r\nhe refers to, as some of their matter may have escaped your notice, and\r\nthe traitorous designs fostered in Massachusetts, and explained in them,\r\ncall for attention.\r\n\r\nWe have never seen so unpromising a crop of wheat as that now growing.\r\nThe winter killed an unusual proportion of it, and the fly is destroying\r\nthe remainder. We may estimate the latter loss at one-third at present,\r\nand fast increasing from the effect of the extraordinary drought. With\r\nsuch a prospect before us, the blockade is acting severely on our past\r\nlabors. It caught nearly the whole wheat of the middle and upper country\r\nin the hands of the farmers and millers, whose interior situation had\r\nprevented their getting it to an earlier market. From this neighborhood\r\nvery little had been sold. When we cast our eyes on the map, and see\r\nthe extent of country from New York to North Carolina inclusive, whose\r\nproduce is raised on the waters of the Chesapeake, (for Albemarle sound\r\nis, by the canal of Norfolk, become a water of the Chesapeake,) and\r\nconsider its productiveness, in comparison with the rest of the Atlantic\r\nStates, probably a full half, and that all this can be shut up by two\r\nor three ships of the line lying at the mouth of the bay, we see that\r\nan injury so vast to ourselves and so cheap to our enemy, must forever\r\nbe resorted to by them, and constantly maintained. To defend all the\r\nshores of those waters in detail is impossible. But is there not a single\r\npoint where they may be all defended by means to which the magnitude of\r\nthe object gives a title? I mean at the mouth of the Chesapeake. Not by\r\nships of the line, or frigates; for I know that with our present enemy\r\nwe cannot contend in that way. But would not a sufficient number of\r\ngun-boats of _small_ draught, stationed in Lynhaven river, render it\r\nunsafe for ships of war either to ascend the Chesapeake or to lie at\r\nits mouth? I am not unaware of the effect of the ridicule cast on this\r\ninstrument of defence by those who wished for engines of offence. But\r\nresort is had to ridicule only when reason is against us. I know, too,\r\nthe prejudices of the gentlemen of the navy, and that these are very\r\nnatural. No one has been more gratified than myself by the brilliant\r\nachievements of our little navy. They have deeply wounded the pride of\r\nour enemy, and been balm to ours, humiliated on the land where our real\r\nstrength was felt to lie. But divesting ourselves of the enthusiasm these\r\nbrave actions have justly excited, it is impossible not to see that all\r\nthese vessels must be taken and added to the already overwhelming force\r\nof our enemy; that even while we keep them, they contribute nothing to\r\nour defence, and that so far as we are to be defended by anything on\r\nthe water, it must be by such vessels as can assail under advantageous\r\ncircumstances, and under adverse ones withdraw from the reach of the\r\nenemy. This, in shoally waters, is the humble, the ridiculed, but the\r\nformidable gun-boats. I acknowledge that in the case which produces these\r\nreflections, the station of Lynhaven river would not be safe against land\r\nattacks on the boats, and that a retreat for them is necessary in this\r\nevent. With a view to this there was a survey made by Colonel Tatham,\r\nwhich was lodged either in the war or navy office, showing the depth and\r\nlength of a canal which would give them a retreat from Lynhaven river\r\ninto the eastern branch of Elizabeth river. I think the distance is not\r\nover six or eight miles, perhaps not so much, through a country entirely\r\nflat, and little above the level of the sea. A cut of ten yards wide\r\nand four yards deep, requiring the removal of forty cubic yards of earth\r\nfor every yard in length of the canal, at twenty cents the cubic yard,\r\nwould cost about $15,000 a mile. But even doubling this to cover all\r\nerrors of estimate, although in a country offering the cheapest kind of\r\nlabor, it would be nothing compared with the extent and productions of\r\nthe country it is to protect. It would, for so great a country, bear no\r\nproportion to what has been expended, and justly expended by the Union,\r\nto defend the single spot of New York.\r\n\r\nWhile such a channel of retreat secures effectually the safety of the\r\ngun-boats, it insures also their aid for the defence of Norfolk, if\r\nattacked from the sea. And the Norfolk canal gives them a further passage\r\ninto Albemarle sound, if necessary for their safety, or in aid of the\r\nflotilla of that sound, or to receive the aid of that flotilla either\r\nat Norfolk or in Lynhaven river. For such a flotilla there also will\r\ndoubtless be thought necessary, that being the only outlet now, as during\r\nthe last war, for the waters of the Chesapeake. Colonel Monroe, I think,\r\nis personally intimate with the face of all that country, and no one,\r\nI am certain, is more able or more disposed than the present Secretary\r\nof the Navy, to place himself above the navy prejudices, and do justice\r\nto the aptitude of these humble and economical vessels to the shallow\r\nwaters of the South. On the bold Northern shores they would be of less\r\naccount, and the larger vessels will of course be more employed there.\r\nWere they stationed with us, they would rather attract danger than ward\r\nit off. The only service they can render us would be to come _in a body_\r\nwhen the occasion offers, of overwhelming a weaker force of the enemy\r\noccupying our bay, to oblige them to keep their force in a body, leaving\r\nthe mass of our coast open.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is probable there may not be an idea here which has not\r\nbeen maturely weighed by yourself, and with a much broader view of\r\nthe whole field, yet I have frankly hazarded them, because possibly\r\nsome of the facts or ideas may have escaped in the multiplicity of the\r\nobjects engaging your notice, and because in every event they will cost\r\nyou but the trouble of reading. The importance of keeping open a water\r\nwhich covers wholly or considerably five of the most productive States,\r\ncontaining three-fifths of the population of the Atlantic portion of\r\nour Union, and of preserving their resources for the support of the\r\nwar, as far as the state of war and the means of the confederacy will\r\nadmit; and especially if it can be done for less than is contributed by\r\nthe Union for more than one single city, will justify our anxieties to\r\nhave it effected. And should my views of the subject be even wrong, I am\r\nsure they will find their apology with you in the purity of the motives\r\nof personal and public regard which induce a suggestion of them. In\r\nall cases I am satisfied you are doing what is for the best, as far as\r\nthe means put into your hands will enable you, and this thought quiets\r\nme under every occurrence, and under every occurrence I am sincerely,\r\naffectionately and respectfully yours.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MADAME LA BARONNE DE STAEL-HOLSTEIN.\r\n\r\n                                    UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, May 24, 1813.\r\n\r\nI received with great pleasure, my dear Madam and friend, your letter\r\nof November the 10th, from Stockholm, and am sincerely gratified by the\r\noccasion it gives me of expressing to you the sentiments of high respect\r\nand esteem which I entertain for you. It recalls to my remembrance a happy\r\nportion of my life, passed in your native city; then the seat of the most\r\namiable and polished society of the world, and of which yourself and your\r\nvenerable father were such distinguished members. But of what scenes has\r\nit since been the theatre, and with what havoc has it overspread the\r\nearth! Robespierre met the fate, and his memory the execration, he so\r\njustly merited. The rich were his victims, and perished by thousands.\r\nIt is by millions that Bonaparte destroys the poor, and he is eulogized\r\nand deified by the sycophants even of science. These merit more than\r\nthe mere oblivion to which they will be consigned; and the day will come\r\nwhen a just posterity will give to their hero the only pre-eminence he\r\nhas earned, that of having been the greatest of the destroyers of the\r\nhuman race. What year of his military life has not consigned a million of\r\nhuman beings to death, to poverty and wretchedness! What field in Europe\r\nmay not raise a monument of the murders, the burnings, the desolations,\r\nthe famines and miseries it has witnessed from him! And all this to\r\nacquire a reputation, which Cartouche attained with less injury to\r\nmankind, of being fearless of God or man.\r\n\r\nTo complete and universalize the desolation of the globe, it has been\r\nthe will of Providence to raise up, at the same time, a tyrant as\r\nunprincipled and as overwhelming, for the ocean. Not in the poor maniac\r\nGeorge, but in his government and nation. Bonaparte will die, and his\r\ntyrannies with him. But a nation never dies. The English government, and\r\nits piratical principles and practices, have no fixed term of duration.\r\nEurope feels, and is writhing under the scorpion whips of Bonaparte. We\r\nare assailed by those of England. The one continent thus placed under\r\nthe gripe of England, and the other of Bonaparte, each has to grapple\r\nwith the enemy immediately pressing on itself. We must extinguish the\r\nfire kindled in our own house, and leave to our friends beyond the water\r\nthat which is consuming theirs. It was not till England had taken one\r\nthousand of our ships, and impressed into her service more than six\r\nthousand of our citizens; till she had declared, by the proclamation of\r\nher Prince Regent, that she would not repeal her aggressive orders _as\r\nto us_, until Bonaparte should have repealed his _as to all nations_;\r\ntill her minister, in formal conference with ours, declared, that no\r\nproposition for protecting our seamen from being impressed, under color\r\nof taking their own, was practicable or admissible; that, the door to\r\njustice and to all amicable arrangement being closed, and negotiation\r\nbecome both desperate and dishonorable, we concluded that the war she\r\nhad for years been waging against us, might as well become a war on\r\nboth sides. She takes fewer vessels from us since the declaration of\r\nwar than before, because they venture more cautiously; and we now make\r\nfull reprisals where before we made none. England is, in principle,\r\nthe enemy of all maritime nations, as Bonaparte is of the continental;\r\nand I place in the same line of insult to the human understanding, the\r\npretension of conquering the ocean, to establish continental rights, as\r\nthat of conquering the continent, to restore maritime rights. No, my dear\r\nMadam; the object of England is the _permanent dominion of the ocean_,\r\nand the _monopoly of the trade of the world_. To secure this, she must\r\nkeep a larger fleet than her own resources will maintain. The resources\r\nof other nations, then, must be impressed to supply the deficiency of\r\nher own. This is sufficiently developed and evidenced by her successive\r\nstrides towards the usurpation of the sea. Mark them, from her first war\r\nafter William Pitt, the little, came into her administration. She first\r\nforbade to neutrals all trade with her enemies in time of war, which\r\nthey had not in time of peace. This deprived them of their trade from\r\nport to port of the same nation. Then she forbade them to trade from\r\nthe port of one nation to that of any other at war with her, although a\r\nright fully exercised in time of peace. Next, instead of taking vessels\r\nonly _entering_ a blockaded port, she took them over the whole ocean, if\r\ndestined to that port, although ignorant of the blockade, and without\r\nintention to violate it. Then she took them returning from that port,\r\nas if infected by previous infraction of blockade. Then came her paper\r\nblockades, by which she might shut up the whole world without sending\r\na ship to sea, except to take all those sailing on it, as they must, of\r\ncourse, be bound to some port. And these were followed by her orders of\r\ncouncil, forbidding every nation to go to the port of any other, without\r\ncoming first to some port of Great Britain, there paying a tribute to\r\nher, regulated by the cargo, and taking from her a license to proceed\r\nto the port of destination; which operation the vessel was to repeat\r\nwith the return cargo on its way home. According to these orders, we\r\ncould not send a vessel from St. Mary's to St. Augustine, distant six\r\nhours sail on our own coast, without crossing the Atlantic four times,\r\ntwice with the outward cargo, and twice with the inward. She found this\r\ntoo daring and outrageous for a single step, retracted as to certain\r\narticles of commerce, but left it in force as to others which constitute\r\nimportant branches of our exports. And finally, that her views may no\r\nlonger rest on inference, in a recent debate her minister declared in\r\nopen parliament, that the object of the present war is a _monopoly of\r\ncommerce_.\r\n\r\nIn some of these atrocities, France kept pace with her fully in\r\nspeculative wrong, which her impotence only shortened in practical\r\nexecution. This was called retaliation by both; each charging the other\r\nwith the initiation of the outrage. As if two combatants might retaliate\r\non an innocent bystander, the blows they received from each other. To\r\nmake war on both would have been ridiculous. In order, therefore, to\r\nsingle out an enemy, we offered to both, that if either would revoke\r\nits hostile decrees, and the other should refuse, we would interdict all\r\nintercourse whatever with that other; which would be war of course, as\r\nbeing an avowed departure from neutrality. France accepted the offer, and\r\nrevoked her decrees as to us. England not only refused, but declared by a\r\nsolemn proclamation of her Prince Regent, that she would not revoke her\r\norders _even as to us_, until those of France should be annulled _as to\r\nthe whole world_. We thereon declared war, and with abundant additional\r\ncause.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, an examination before parliament of the ruinous effects\r\nof these orders on her own manufacturers, exposing them to the nation and\r\nto the world, their Prince issued a palinodial proclamation, _suspending_\r\nthe orders on certain conditions, but claiming to renew them at pleasure,\r\nas a matter of right. Even this might have prevented the war, if done\r\nand known here before its declaration. But the sword being once drawn,\r\nthe expense of arming incurred, and hostilities in full course, it would\r\nhave been unwise to discontinue them, until effectual provision should\r\nbe agreed to by England, for protecting our citizens on the high seas\r\nfrom impressment by her naval commanders, through error, voluntary or\r\ninvoluntary; the fact being notorious, that these officers, entering our\r\nships at sea under pretext of searching for their seamen, (which they\r\nhave no right to do by the law or usage of nations, which they neither\r\ndo, nor ever did, as to any other nation but ours, and which no nation\r\never before pretended to do in any case,) entering our ships, I say,\r\nunder pretext of searching for and taking out their seamen, they took\r\nours, native as well as naturalized, knowing them to be ours, merely\r\nbecause they wanted them; insomuch, that no American could safely cross\r\nthe ocean, or venture to pass by sea from one to another of our own\r\nports. It is not long since they impressed at sea two nephews of General\r\nWashington, returning from Europe, and put them, as common seamen, under\r\nthe ordinary discipline of their ships of war. There are certainly other\r\nwrongs to be settled between England and us; but of a minor character,\r\nand such as a proper spirit of conciliation on both sides would not\r\npermit to continue them at war. The sword, however, can never again be\r\nsheathed, until the personal safety of an American on the ocean, among\r\nthe most important and most vital of the rights we possess, is completely\r\nprovided for.\r\n\r\nAs soon as we heard of her partial repeal of her orders of council, we\r\noffered instantly to suspend hostilities by an armistice, if she would\r\nsuspend her impressments, and meet us in arrangements for securing\r\nour citizens against them. She refused to do it, because impracticable\r\nby any arrangement, as she pretends; but, in truth, because a body of\r\nsixty to eighty thousand of the finest seamen in the world, which we\r\npossess, is too great a resource for manning her exaggerated navy, to\r\nbe relinquished, as long as she can keep it open. Peace is in her hand,\r\nwhenever she will renounce the practice of aggression on the persons\r\nof our citizens. If she thinks it worth eternal war, eternal war we\r\nmust have. She alleges that the sameness of language, of manners, of\r\nappearance, renders it impossible to distinguish us from her subjects.\r\nBut because we speak English, and look like them, are we to be punished?\r\nAre free and independent men to be submitted to their bondage?\r\n\r\nEngland has misrepresented to all Europe this ground of the war. She\r\nhas called it a new pretension, set up since the repeal of her orders\r\nof council. She knows there has never been a moment of suspension of our\r\nreclamation against it, from General Washington's time inclusive, to the\r\npresent day; and that it is distinctly stated in our declaration of war,\r\nas one of its principal causes. She has pretended we have entered into\r\nthe war to establish the principle of \"free bottoms, free goods,\" or\r\nto protect her seamen against her own rights over them. We contend for\r\nneither of these. She pretends we are partial to France; that we have\r\nobserved a fraudulent and unfaithful neutrality between her and her enemy.\r\nShe knows this to be false, and that if there has been any inequality\r\nin our proceedings towards the belligerents, it has been in her favor.\r\nHer ministers are in possession of full proofs of this. Our accepting\r\nat once, and sincerely, the mediation of the virtuous Alexander, their\r\ngreatest friend, and the most aggravated enemy of Bonaparte, sufficiently\r\nproves whether we have partialities on the side of her enemy. I sincerely\r\npray that this mediation may produce a just peace. It will prove that\r\nthe immortal character, which has first stopped by war the career of\r\nthe destroyer of mankind, is the friend of peace, of justice, of human\r\nhappiness, and the patron of unoffending and injured nations. He is too\r\nhonest and impartial to countenance propositions of peace derogatory to\r\nthe freedom of the seas.\r\n\r\nShall I apologize to you, my dear Madam, for this long political\r\nletter? But yours justifies the subject, and my feelings must plead\r\nfor the unreserved expression of them; and they have been the less\r\nreserved, as being from a private citizen, retired from all connection\r\nwith the government of his country, and whose ideas, expressed without\r\ncommunication with any one, are neither known, nor imputable to them.\r\n\r\nThe dangers of the sea are now so great, and the possibilities of\r\ninterception by sea and land such, that I shall subscribe no name to\r\nthis letter. You will know from whom it comes, by its reference to the\r\ndate of time and place of yours, as well as by its subject in answer to\r\nthat. This omission must not lessen in your view the assurances of my\r\ngreat esteem, of my sincere sympathies for the share which you bear in\r\nthe afflictions of your country, and the deprivation to which a lawless\r\nwill has subjected you. In return, you enjoy the dignified satisfaction\r\nof having met them, rather than be yoked with the abject, to his car;\r\nand that, in withdrawing from oppression, you have followed the virtuous\r\nexample of a father whose name will ever be dear to your country and\r\nto mankind. With my prayers that you may be restored to it, that you\r\nmay see it re-established in that temperate portion of liberty which\r\ndoes not infer either anarchy or licentiousness, in that high degree\r\nof prosperity which would be the consequence of such a government, in\r\nthat, in short, which the constitution of 1789 would have insured it,\r\nif wisdom could have stayed at that point the fervid but imprudent zeal\r\nof men, who did not know the character of their own countrymen, and\r\nthat you may long live in health and happiness under it, and leave to\r\nthe world a well-educated and virtuous representative and descendant of\r\nyour honored father, is the ardent prayer of the sincere and respectful\r\nfriend who writes this letter.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n                                                  MONTICELLO, May 27, 1813.\r\n\r\nAnother of our friends of seventy-six is gone, my dear Sir, another of\r\nthe co-signers of the Independence of our country. And a better man than\r\nRush could not have left us, more benevolent, more learned, of finer\r\ngenius, or more honest. We too must go; and that ere long. I believe we\r\nare under half a dozen at present; I mean the signers of the Declaration.\r\nYourself, Gerry, Carroll, and myself, are all I know to be living. I\r\nam the only one south of the Potomac. Is Robert Treat Payne, or Floyd\r\nliving? It is long since I heard of them, and yet I do not recollect to\r\nhave heard of their deaths.\r\n\r\nMoreton's deduction of the origin of our Indians from the fugitive\r\nTrojans, stated in your letter of January the 26th, and his manner of\r\naccounting for the sprinkling of their Latin with Greek, is really\r\namusing. Adair makes them talk Hebrew. Reinold Foster derives them\r\nfrom the soldiers sent by Kouli Khan to conquer Japan. Brerewood, from\r\nthe Tartars, as well as our bears, wolves, foxes, &c., which, he says,\r\n\"must of necessity fetch their beginning from Noah's ark, which rested,\r\nafter the deluge in Asia, seeing they could not proceed by the course of\r\nnature, as the imperfect sort of living creatures do, from putrefaction.\"\r\nBernard Romans is of opinion that God created an original man and woman\r\nin this part of the globe. Doctor Barton thinks they are not specifically\r\ndifferent from the Persians; but, taking afterwards a broader range,\r\nhe thinks, \"that in all the vast countries of America, there is but one\r\nlanguage, nay, that it may be proven, or rendered highly probable, that\r\nall the languages of the earth bear some affinity together.\" This reduces\r\nit to a question of definition, in which every one is free to use his\r\nown: to wit, what constitutes identity, or difference in two things, in\r\nthe common acceptation of _sameness_? All languages may be called the\r\nsame, as being all made up of the same primitive sounds, expressed by\r\nthe letters of the different alphabets. But, in this sense, all things\r\non earth are the same as consisting of matter. This gives up the useful\r\ndistribution into genera and species, which we form, arbitrarily indeed,\r\nfor the relief of our imperfect memories. To aid the question, from\r\nwhence our Indian tribes descended, some have gone into their religion,\r\ntheir morals, their manners, customs, habits, and physical forms. By\r\nsuch helps it may be learnedly proved, that our trees and plants of every\r\nkind are descended from those of Europe; because, like them, they have no\r\nlocomotion, they draw nourishment from the earth, they clothe themselves\r\nwith leaves in spring, of which they divest themselves in autumn for\r\nthe sleep of winter, &c. Our animals too must be descended from those of\r\nEurope, because our wolves eat lambs, our deer are gregarious, our ants\r\nhoard, &c. But, when for convenience we distribute languages, according\r\nto common understanding, into classes originally different, as we choose\r\nto consider them, as the Hebrew, the Greek, the Celtic, the Gothic; and\r\nthese again into genera, or families, as the Icelandic, German, Swedish,\r\nDanish, English; and these last into species, or dialects, as English,\r\nScotch, Irish, we then ascribe other meanings to the terms \"same\" and\r\n\"different.\" In some one of these senses, Barton, and Adair, and Foster,\r\nand Brerewood, and Moreton, may be right, every one according to his\r\nown definition of what constitutes \"identity.\" Romans, indeed, takes a\r\nhigher stand, and supposes a separate creation. On the same unscriptural\r\nground, he had but to mount one step higher, to suppose no creation\r\nat all, but that all things have existed without beginning in time, as\r\nthey now exist, and may forever exist, producing and reproducing in a\r\ncircle, without end. This would very summarily dispose of Mr. Moreton's\r\nlearning, and show that the question of Indian origin, like many others,\r\npushed to a certain height, must receive the same answer, \"Ignoro.\"\r\n\r\nYou ask if the usage of hunting in circles has ever been known among\r\nany of our tribes of Indians? It has been practised by them all; and is\r\nto this day, by those still remote from the settlements of the whites.\r\nBut their numbers not enabling them, like Genghis Khan's seven hundred\r\nthousand, to form themselves into circles of one hundred miles diameter,\r\nthey make their circle by firing the leaves fallen on the ground, which\r\ngradually forcing the animals to a centre, they there slaughter them with\r\narrows, darts, and other missiles. This is called fire hunting, and has\r\nbeen practised in this State within my time, by the white inhabitants.\r\nThis is the most probable cause of the origin and extension of the\r\nvast prairies in the western country, where the grass having been of\r\nextraordinary luxuriance, has made a conflagration sufficient to kill\r\neven the old as well as the young timber.\r\n\r\nI sincerely congratulate you on the successes of our little navy; which\r\nmust be more gratifying to you than to most men, as having been the early\r\nand constant advocate of wooden walls. If I have differed with you on\r\nthis ground, it was not on the principle, but the time; supposing that\r\nwe cannot build or maintain a navy, which will not immediately fall into\r\nthe same gulf which has swallowed not only the minor navies, but even\r\nthose of the great second-rate powers of the sea. Whenever these can be\r\nresuscitated, and brought so near to a balance with England that we can\r\nturn the scale, then is my epoch for aiming at a navy. In the meantime,\r\none competent to keep the Barbary States in order, is necessary; these\r\nbeing the only smaller powers disposed to quarrel with us. But I respect\r\ntoo much the weighty opinions of others, to be unyielding on this point,\r\nand acquiesce with the prayer \"_quod felix faustumque sit_;\" adding ever\r\na sincere one for your health and happiness.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL MONROE.\r\n\r\n                                                  MONTICELLO, May 30, 1813.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I thank you for the communication of the President's Message,\r\nwhich has not yet reached us through the public papers. It is an\r\ninteresting document, always looked for with anxiety, and the late one\r\nis equally able as interesting. I hope Congress will act in conformity\r\nwith it, in all its parts. The unwarrantable ideas often expressed in the\r\nnewspapers, and by persons who ought to know better, that I intermeddle\r\nin the Executive councils, and the indecent expressions, sometimes, of\r\na hope that Mr. Madison will pursue the principles of my administration,\r\nexpressions so disrespectful to his known abilities and dispositions, have\r\nrendered it improper in me to hazard suggestions to him, on occasions\r\neven where ideas might occur to me, that might accidentally escape him.\r\nThis reserve has been strengthened, too, by a consciousness that my\r\nviews must be very imperfect, from the want of a correct knowledge of\r\nthe whole ground.\r\n\r\nI lately, however, hazarded to him a suggestion on the defence of\r\nthe Chesapeake, because, although decided on provisionally with the\r\nSecretaries of War and the Navy formerly, yet as it was proposed only in\r\nthe case of war, which did not actually arise, and not relating to his\r\ndepartment, might not then have been communicated to him. Of this fact\r\nmy memory did not ascertain me. I will now hazard another suggestion\r\nto yourself, which indeed grows out of that one: it is, the policy of\r\nkeeping our frigates together in a body, in some place where they can be\r\ndefended against a superior naval force, and from whence, nevertheless,\r\nthey can easily sally forth on the shortest warning. This would oblige\r\nthe enemy to take stations, or to cruise only in masses equal at least,\r\neach of them, to our whole force; and of course they could be acting\r\nonly in two or three spots at a time, and the whole of our coast, except\r\nthe two or three portions where they might be present, would be open\r\nto exportation and importation. I think all that part of the United\r\nStates over which the waters of the Chesapeake spread themselves, was\r\nblockaded in the early season by a single ship. This would keep our\r\nfrigates in entire safety, as they would go out only occasionally to\r\noppress a blockading force known to be weaker than themselves, and thus\r\nmake them a real protection to our whole commerce. And it seems to me\r\nthat this would be a more essential service, than that of going out by\r\nones, or twos, in search of adventures, which contribute little to the\r\nprotection of our commerce, and not at all to the defence of our coast,\r\nor the shores of our inland waters. A defence of these by militia is\r\nmost harassing to them. The applications from Maryland, which I have\r\nseen in the papers, and those from Virginia, which I suspect, merely\r\nbecause I see such masses of the militia called off from their farms,\r\nmust be embarrassing to the Executive, not only from a knowledge of\r\nthe incompetency of such a mode of defence, but from the exhausture\r\nof funds which ought to be husbanded for the effectual operations of a\r\nlong war. I fear, too, it will render the militia discontented, perhaps\r\nclamorous for an end of the war on any terms. I am happy to see that\r\nit is entirely popular as yet, and that no symptom of flinching from it\r\nappears among the people, as far as I can judge from the public papers,\r\nor from my own observation, limited to the few counties adjacent to the\r\ntwo branches of James river. I have such confidence that what I suggest\r\nhas been already maturely discussed in the Cabinet, and that for wise\r\nand sufficient reasons the present mode of employing the frigates is the\r\nbest, that I hesitate about sending this even after having written. Yet\r\nin that case it will only have given you the trouble of reading it. You\r\nwill bury it in your own breast, as _non-avenue_, and see in it only an\r\nunnecessary zeal on my part, and a proof of the unlimited confidence of\r\nyours ever and affectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n                                                 MONTICELLO, June 15, 1813.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I wrote you a letter on the 27th of May, which probably would\r\nreach you about the 3d instant, and on the 9th I received yours of the\r\n29th of May. Of Lindsay's Memoirs I had never before heard, and scarcely\r\nindeed of himself. It could not, therefore, but be unexpected, that two\r\nletters of mine should have anything to do with his life. The name of his\r\neditor was new to me, and certainly presents itself for the first time\r\nunder unfavorable circumstances. Religion, I suppose, is the scope of\r\nhis book; and that a writer on that subject should usher himself to the\r\nworld in the very act of the grossest abuse of confidence, by publishing\r\nprivate letters which passed between two friends, with no views to their\r\never being made public, is an instance of inconsistency as well as of\r\ninfidelity, of which I would rather be the victim than the author.\r\n\r\nBy your kind quotation of the dates of my two letters, I have been enabled\r\nto turn to them. They had completely vanished from my memory. The last\r\nis on the subject of religion, and by its publication will gratify the\r\npriesthood with new occasion of repeating their comminations against me.\r\nThey wish it to be believed that he can have no religion who advocates\r\nits freedom. This was not the doctrine of Priestley; and I honored him\r\nfor the example of liberality he set to his order. The first letter is\r\npolitical. It recalls to our recollection the gloomy transactions of the\r\ntimes, the doctrines they witnessed, and the sensibilities they excited.\r\nIt was a confidential communication of reflections on these from one\r\nfriend to another, deposited in his bosom, and never meant to trouble\r\nthe public mind. Whether the character of the times is justly portrayed\r\nor not, posterity will decide. But on one feature of them they can never\r\ndecide, the sensations excited in free yet firm minds by the terrorism\r\nof the day. None can conceive who did not witness them, and they were\r\nfelt by one party only. This letter exhibits their side of the medal.\r\nThe federalists, no doubt, have presented the other in their private\r\ncorrespondences as well as open action. If these correspondences should\r\never be laid open to the public eye, they will probably be found not\r\nmodels of comity towards their adversaries. The readers of my letter\r\nshould be cautioned not to confine its view to this country alone. England\r\nand its alarmists were equally under consideration. Still less must they\r\nconsider it as looking personally towards you. You happen, indeed, to\r\nbe quoted, because you happened to express more pithily than had been\r\ndone by themselves, one of the mottos of the party. This was in your\r\nanswer to the address of the young men of Philadelphia. [See Selection\r\nof Patriotic Addresses, page 198.] One of the questions, you know, on\r\nwhich our parties took different sides, was on the improvability of the\r\nhuman mind in science, in ethics, in government, &c. Those who advocated\r\nreformation of institutions, _pari passu_ with the progress of science,\r\nmaintained that no definite limits could be assigned to that progress. The\r\nenemies of reform, on the other hand, denied improvement, and advocated\r\nsteady adherence to the principles, practices and institutions of our\r\nfathers, which they represented as the consummation of wisdom, and acme\r\nof excellence, beyond which the human mind could never advance. Although\r\nin the passage of your answer alluded to, you expressly disclaim the wish\r\nto influence the freedom of inquiry, you predict that that will produce\r\nnothing more worthy of transmission to posterity than the principles,\r\ninstitutions and systems of education received from their ancestors. I\r\ndo not consider this as your deliberate opinion. You possess, yourself,\r\ntoo much science, not to see how much is still ahead of you, unexplained\r\nand unexplored. Your own consciousness must place you as far before our\r\nancestors as in the rear of our posterity. I consider it as an expression\r\nlent to the prejudices of your friends; and although I happened to cite\r\nit from you, the whole letter shows I had them only in view. In truth,\r\nmy dear Sir, we were far from considering you as the author of all the\r\nmeasures we blamed. They were placed under the protection of your name,\r\nbut we were satisfied they wanted much of your approbation. We ascribed\r\nthem to their real authors, the Pickerings, the Wolcotts, the Tracys,\r\nthe Sedgwicks, et _id genus omne_, with whom we supposed you in a state\r\nof duress. I well remember a conversation with you in the morning of the\r\nday on which you nominated to the Senate a substitute for Pickering, in\r\nwhich you expressed a just impatience under \"the legacy of secretaries\r\nwhich General Washington had left you,\" and whom you seemed, therefore,\r\nto consider as under public protection. Many other incidents showed how\r\ndifferently you would have acted with less impassioned advisers; and\r\nsubsequent events have proved that your minds were not together. You\r\nwould do me great injustice, therefore, by taking to yourself what was\r\nintended for men who were then your secret, as they are now your open\r\nenemies. Should you write on the subject, as you propose, I am sure we\r\nshall see you place yourself farther from them than from us.\r\n\r\nAs to myself, I shall take no part in any discussions. I leave others to\r\njudge of what I have done, and to give me exactly that place which they\r\nshall think I have occupied. Marshall has written libels on one side;\r\nothers, I suppose, will be written on the other side; and the world will\r\nsift both and separate the truth as well as they can. I should see with\r\nreluctance the passions of that day rekindled in this, while so many of\r\nthe actors are living, and all are too near the scene not to participate\r\nin sympathies with them. About facts you and I cannot differ; because\r\ntruth is our mutual guide. And if any opinions you may express should\r\nbe different from mine, I shall receive them with the liberality and\r\nindulgence which I ask for my own, and still cherish with warmth the\r\nsentiments of affectionate respect, of which I can with so much truth\r\ntender you the assurance.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. SHORT.\r\n\r\n                                                 MONTICELLO, June 18, 1813.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Yours of the 2d is received, and a copy of Higgenbotham's\r\nmortgage is now enclosed. The journey to Bedford which I proposed in my\r\nlast, my engagements here have obliged me to postpone till after harvest,\r\nwhich is now approaching; it is the most unpromising one I have seen. We\r\nhave been some days in expectation of seeing M. Correa. If he is on the\r\nroad, he has had some days of our very hottest weather. My thermometer\r\nhas been for two days at 92 and 92½°, the last being the maximum ever\r\nseen here. Although we usually have the hottest day of the year in June,\r\nyet it is soon interrupted by cooler weather. In July the heat, though\r\nnot so great, is more continuous and steady.\r\n\r\nOn the duration of the war I think there is uncertainty. Ever since\r\nthe rupture of the treaty of Amiens, the object of Great Britain has\r\nvisibly been the permanent conquest of the ocean, and levying a tribute\r\non every vessel she permits to sail on it, as the Barbary powers do on\r\nthe Mediterranean, which they call their sea. She must be conscious she\r\ncannot from her own resources maintain the exaggerated fleet she now has,\r\nand which is necessary to maintain her conquest; she must, therefore,\r\nlevy the deficiency of duties of transit on other nations. If she should\r\nget another ministry with sense enough to abandon this senseless scheme,\r\nthe war with us ought to be short, because there is no material cause\r\nnow existing but impressment; and there our only difference is how to\r\nestablish a mode of discrimination between our citizens which she does\r\nnot claim, and hers which it is neither our wish or interest ever to\r\nemploy. The seamen which our navigation raises had better be of our\r\nown. If this be all she aims at, it may be settled at Saint Petersburg.\r\nMy principle has ever been that war should not suspend either exports\r\nor imports. If the piracies of France and England, however, are to be\r\nadopted as the law of nations, or should become their practice, it will\r\noblige us to manufacture at home all the material comforts.\r\n\r\nThis may furnish a reason to check imports until necessary manufactures\r\nare established among us. This offers the advantage, too, of placing the\r\nconsumer of our produce near the producer, but I should disapprove of\r\nthe prohibition of exports even to the enemy themselves, except indeed\r\nrefreshments and water to their cruisers on our coast, in order to oblige\r\nthem to intermit their cruises to go elsewhere for these supplies. The\r\nidea of starving them as to bread, is a very idle one. It is dictated by\r\npassion, not by reason. If the war is lengthened we shall take Canada,\r\nwhich will relieve us from Indians, and Halifax, which will put an end\r\nto their occupation of the American seas, because every vessel must then\r\ngo to England to repair every accident. To retain these would become\r\nobjects of first importance to us, and of great importance to Europe,\r\nas the means of curtailing the British marine. But at present, being\r\nmerely _in posse_, they should not be an impediment to peace. We have a\r\ngreat and a just claim of indemnifications against them for the thousand\r\nships they have taken piratically, and six thousand seamen impressed.\r\nWhether we can, on this score, successfully insist on curtailing their\r\nAmerican possessions, by the meridian of Lake Huron, so as to cut them\r\noff from the Indians bordering on us, would be matter for conversation\r\nand experiment at the treaty of pacification. I sometimes allow my mind\r\nto wander thus into the political field, but rarely, and with reluctance.\r\nIt is my desire as well as my duty to leave to the vigor of younger minds\r\nto settle concerns which are no longer mine, but must long be theirs.\r\nAffectionately adieu.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ----.\r\n\r\nYour kind answer of the 16th entirely satisfies my doubts as to the\r\nemployment of the navy, if kept within striking distance of our coast;\r\nand shows how erroneous views are apt to be with those who have not\r\nall in view. Yet as I know from experience that profitable suggestions\r\nsometimes come from lookers on, they may be usefully tolerated, provided\r\nthey do not pretend to the right of an answer. They would cost very\r\ndear indeed were they to occupy the time of a high officer in writing\r\nwhen he should be acting. I intended no such trouble to you, my dear\r\nSir, and were you to suppose I expected it, I must cease to offer a\r\nthought on our public affairs. Although my entire confidence in their\r\ndirection prevents my reflecting on them but accidentally, yet sometimes\r\nfacts, and sometimes ideas occur, which I hazard as worth the trouble\r\nof reading but not of answering. Of this kind was my suggestion of the\r\nfacts which I recollected as to the defence of the Chesapeake, and of\r\nwhat had been contemplated at the time between the Secretaries of War\r\nand the Navy and myself. If our views were sound, the object might be\r\neffected in one year, even of war, and at an expense which is nothing\r\ncompared to the population and productions it would cover. We are here\r\nlaboring under the most extreme drought ever remembered at this season.\r\nWe have had but one rain to lay the dust in two months. That was a good\r\none, but was three weeks ago. Corn is but a few inches high and dying.\r\nOats will not yield their seed. Of wheat, the hard winter and fly leave\r\nus about two-thirds of an ordinary crop. So that in the lotteries of\r\nhuman life you see that even farming is but gambling. We have had three\r\ndays of excessive heat. The thermometer on the 16th was at 92°, on the\r\n17th 92½°, and yesterday at 93°. It had never before exceeded 92½ at\r\nthis place; at least within the periods of my observations. Ever and\r\naffectionately yours.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL MONROE.\r\n\r\n                                                 MONTICELLO, June 18, 1813.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favors of the 7th and 16th are received, and I now\r\nreturn you the memoir enclosed in the former. I am much gratified by its\r\ncommunication, because, as the plan appeared in the newspapers soon after\r\nthe new Secretary of War came into office, we had given him the credit\r\nof it. Every line of it is replete with wisdom; and we might lament that\r\nour tardy enlistments prevented its execution, were we not to reflect\r\nthat these proceeded from the happiness of our people at home. It is more\r\na subject of joy that we have so few of the desperate characters which\r\ncompose modern regular armies. But it proves more forcibly the necessity\r\nof obliging every citizen to be a soldier; this was the case with the\r\nGreeks and Romans, and must be that of every free State. Where there\r\nis no oppression there will be no pauper hirelings. We must train and\r\nclassify the whole of our male citizens, and make military instruction\r\na regular part of collegiate education. We can never be safe till this\r\nis done.\r\n\r\nI have been persuaded, _ab initio_, that what we are to do in Canada\r\nmust be done quickly; because our enemy, with a little time, can empty\r\npickpockets upon us faster than we can enlist honest men to oppose them.\r\nIf we fail in this acquisition, Hull is the cause of it. Pike, in his\r\nsituation, would have swept their posts to Montreal, because his army\r\nwould have grown as it went along. I fear the reinforcements arrived\r\nat Quebec will be at Montreal before General Dearborne, and if so, the\r\ngame is up. If the marching of the militia into an enemy's country be\r\nonce ceded as unconstitutional (which I hope it never will be), then\r\nwill their force, as now strengthened, bid us permanent defiance. Could\r\nwe acquire that country, we might perhaps insist successfully at St.\r\nPetersburg on retaining all westward of the meridian of Lake Huron, or\r\nof Ontario, or of Montreal, according to the pulse of the place, as an\r\nindemnification for the past and security for the future. To cut them off\r\nfrom the Indians even west of the Huron would be a great future security.\r\n\r\nYour kind answer of the 16th, entirely satisfies my doubts as to the\r\nemployment of a navy, if kept within striking distance of our coast, and\r\nshows how erroneous views are apt to be with those who have not all in\r\nview. Yet, as I know by experience that profitable suggestions sometimes\r\ncome from lookers on, they may be usefully tolerated, provided they\r\ndo not pretend to the right of an answer. They would cost very dear,\r\nindeed, were they to occupy the time of a high officer in writing when\r\nhe should be acting. * * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. MATTHEW CARR.\r\n\r\n                                                 MONTICELLO, June 19, 1813.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I thank you for the copy of Mr. Clarke's sketches of the naval\r\nhistory of the United States, which you have been so kind as to send me.\r\nIt is a convenient repository of cases of that class, and has brought to\r\nmy recollection a number of individual cases of the Revolutionary war\r\nwhich had escaped me. I received, also one of Mr. Clarke's circulars,\r\nasking supplementary communications for a second edition. But these\r\nthings are so much out of the reach of my inland situation, that I am\r\nthe least able of all men to contribute anything to his desire. I will\r\nindulge myself, therefore, in two or three observations, of which you\r\nwill make what use you may think they merit. 1. Bushnel's Turtle is\r\nmentioned slightly. Would the description of the machine be too much\r\nfor the sale of the work? It may be found very minutely given in the\r\nAmerican Philosophical transactions. It was excellently contrived, and\r\nmight perhaps, by improvement, be brought into real use. I do not know\r\nthe difference between this and Mr. Fulton's submarine boat. But an\r\neffectual machine of that kind is not beyond the laws of nature; and\r\nwhatever is within these, is not to be despaired of. It would be to the\r\nUnited States the consummation of their safety. 2. The account of the loss\r\nof the Philadelphia, does not give a fair impression of the transaction.\r\nThe proofs may be seen among the records of the Navy office. After this\r\nloss, Capt. Bainbridge had a character to redeem. He has done it most\r\nhonorably, and no one is more gratified by it than myself. But still the\r\ntransaction ought to be correctly stated. 3. But why omit all mention of\r\nthe scandalous campaigns of Commodore Morris? A two years' command of an\r\neffective squadron, with discretionary instructions, wasted in sailing\r\nfrom port to port of the Mediterranean, and a single half day before the\r\nport of the enemy against which he was sent. All this can be seen in\r\nthe proceedings of the court on which he was dismissed; and it is due\r\nto the honorable truths with which the book abounds, to publish those\r\nwhich are not so. A fair and honest narrative of the bad, is a voucher\r\nfor the truth of the good. In this way the old Congress set an example\r\nto the world, for which the world amply repaid them, by giving unlimited\r\ncredit to whatever was stamped with the name of Charles Thompson. It is\r\nknown that this was never put to an untruth but once, and that where\r\nCongress was misled by the credulity of their General (Sullivan). The\r\nfirst misfortune of the Revolutionary war, induced a motion to suppress\r\nor garble the account of it. It was rejected with indignation. The whole\r\ntruth was given in all its details, and there never was another attempt\r\nin that body to disguise it. These observations are meant for the good\r\nof the work, and for the honor of those whom it means to honor. Accept\r\nthe assurance of my esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO PRESIDENT MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                                 MONTICELLO, June 21, 1813.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of the 6th has been received, and I will beg leave\r\nto add a few supplementary observations on the subject of my former\r\nletter. I am not a judge of the best forms which may be given to the\r\ngunboat; and indeed I suppose they should be of various forms, suited\r\nto the various circumstances to which they would be applied. Among\r\nthese, no doubt, Commodore Barney's would find their place. While the\r\nlargest and more expensive are fitted for moving from one seaport to\r\nanother, coast-wise, to aid in a particular emergency, those of smaller\r\ndraught and expense suit shallower waters; and of these shallow and\r\ncheap forms must be those for Lynhaven river. Commodore Preble, in his\r\nlifetime, undertook to build such in the best manner for two or three\r\nthousand dollars. Colonel Monroe, to whose knowledge of the face of the\r\ncountry I had referred, approves, in a letter to me, of such a plan of\r\ndefence as was suggested, adding to it a fort on the middle grounds;\r\nbut thinks the work too great to be executed during a war. Such a fort,\r\ncertainly, could not be built during a war, in the face of an enemy.\r\nIts practicability at any time has been doubted, and although a good\r\nauxiliary, is not a necessary member of this scheme of defence. But the\r\ncanal of retreat is really a small work, of a few months' execution;\r\nthe laborers would be protected by the military guard on the spot, and\r\nmany of these would assist in the execution, for fatigue, rations, and\r\npay. The exact magnitude of the work I would not affirm, nor do I think\r\nwe should trust for it to Tatham's survey: still less would I call in\r\nLatrobe, who would immediately contemplate a canal of Languedoc. I would\r\nsooner trust such a man as Thomas Monroe to take the level, measure the\r\ndistances, and estimate the expense. And if the plan were all matured\r\nthe ensuing winter, and laborers engaged at the proper season, it might\r\nbe executed in time to mitigate the blockade of the next summer. On\r\nrecurring to an actual survey of that part of the country, made in the\r\nbeginning of the Revolutionary war, under the orders of the Governor\r\nand Council, by Mr. Andrews I think, a copy of which I took with great\r\ncare, instead of the half a dozen miles I had conjectured in my former\r\nletter, the canal would seem to be of not half that length. I send you\r\na copy of that part of the map, which may be useful to you on other\r\noccasions, and is more to be depended on for minutia, probably, than\r\nany other existing. I have marked on that the conjectured route of the\r\ncanal, to wit, from the bridge on Lynhaven river to King's landing, on\r\nthe eastern branch. The exact draught of water into Lynhaven river you\r\nhave in the Navy office. I think it is over four feet.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider the population and productions of the Chesapeake country,\r\nextending from the Génissee to the Saura towns and Albemarle Sound, its\r\nsafety and commerce seem entitled even to greater efforts, if greater\r\ncould secure them. That a defence at the entrance of the bay can be made\r\nmainly effective, that it will cost less in money, harass the militia\r\nless, place the inhabitants on its interior waters freer from alarm\r\nand depredation, and render provisions and water more difficult to the\r\nenemy, is so possible as to render thorough inquiry certainly expedient.\r\nSome of the larger gun-boats, or vessels better uniting swiftness with\r\nforce, would also be necessary to scour the interior, and cut off any\r\npickaroons which might venture up the bay or rivers. The loss on James'\r\nriver alone, this year, is estimated at two hundred thousand barrels of\r\nflour, now on hand, for which the half price is not to be expected. This\r\nthen is a million of dollars levied on a single water of the Chesapeake,\r\nand to be levied every year during the war. If a concentration of its\r\ndefence at the entrance of the Chesapeake should be found inadequate,\r\nthen we must of necessity submit to the expenses of detailed defence,\r\nto the harassment of the militia, the burnings of towns and houses,\r\ndepredations of farms, and the hard trial of the spirit of the Middle\r\nStates, the most zealous supporters of the war, and, therefore, the\r\npeculiar objects of the vindictive efforts of the enemy. Those north of\r\nthe Hudson need nothing, because treated by the enemy as neutrals. All\r\ntheir war is concentrated on the Delaware and Chesapeake; and these,\r\ntherefore, stand in principal need of the shield of the Union. The\r\nDelaware can be defended more easily. But I should not think one hundred\r\ngun-boats (costing less than one frigate) an over-proportioned allotment\r\nto the Chesapeake country, against the over-proportioned hostilities\r\npointed at it.\r\n\r\nI am too sensible of the partial and defective state of my information,\r\nto be over-confident, or pertinacious, in the opinion I have formed.\r\nA thorough examination of the ground will settle it. We may suggest,\r\nperhaps it is a duty to do it. But you alone are qualified for decision,\r\nby the whole view which you can command; and so confident am I in the\r\nintentions, as well as wisdom, of the government, that I shall always be\r\nsatisfied that what is not done, either cannot, or ought not to be done.\r\nWhile I trust that no difficulties will dishearten us, I am anxious to\r\nlessen the trial as much as possible. Heaven preserve you under yours,\r\nand help you through all its perplexities and perversities.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN W. EPPES.\r\n\r\n                                                 MONTICELLO, June 24, 1813.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--This letter will be on politics only. For although I do not\r\noften permit myself to think on that subject, it sometimes obtrudes\r\nitself, and suggests ideas which I am tempted to pursue. Some of these\r\nrelating to the business of finance, I will hazard to you, as being at\r\nthe head of that committee, but intended for yourself individually, or\r\nsuch as you trust, but certainly not for a mixed committee.\r\n\r\nIt is a wise rule, and should be fundamental in a government disposed\r\nto cherish its credit, and at the same time to restrain the use of it\r\nwithin the limits of its faculties, \"never to borrow a dollar without\r\nlaying a tax in the same instant for paying the interest annually, and\r\nthe principle within a given term; and to consider that tax as pledged to\r\nthe creditors on the public faith.\" On such a pledge as this, sacredly\r\nobserved, a government may always command, on a _reasonable interest_,\r\nall the lendable money of their citizens, while the necessity of an\r\nequivalent tax is a salutary warning to them and their constituents\r\nagainst oppressions, bankruptcy, and its inevitable consequence,\r\nrevolution. But the term of redemption must be moderate, and at any\r\nrate within the limits of their rightful powers. But what limits, it\r\nwill be asked, does this prescribe to their powers? What is to hinder\r\nthem from creating a perpetual debt? The laws of nature, I answer. The\r\nearth belongs to the living, not to the dead. The will and the power\r\nof man expire with his life, by nature's law. Some societies give it an\r\nartificial continuance, for the encouragement of industry; some refuse\r\nit, as our aboriginal neighbors, whom we call barbarians. The generations\r\nof men may be considered as bodies or corporations. Each generation has\r\nthe usufruct of the earth during the period of its continuance. When it\r\nceases to exist, the usufruct passes on to the succeeding generation,\r\nfree and unincumbered, and so on, successively, from one generation to\r\nanother forever. We may consider each generation as a distinct nation,\r\nwith a right, by the will of its majority, to bind themselves, but none\r\nto bind the succeeding generation, more than the inhabitants of another\r\ncountry. Or the case may be likened to the ordinary one of a tenant for\r\nlife, who may hypothecate the land for his debts, during the continuance\r\nof his usufruct; but at his death, the reversioner (who is also for life\r\nonly) receives it exonerated from all burthen. The period of a generation,\r\nor the term of its life, is determined by the laws of mortality, which,\r\nvarying a little only in different climates, offer a general average,\r\nto be found by observation. I turn, for instance, to Buffon's tables, of\r\ntwenty-three thousand nine hundred and ninety-four deaths, and the ages\r\nat which they happened, and I find that of the numbers of all ages living\r\nat one moment, half will be dead in twenty-four years and eight months.\r\nBut (leaving out minors, who have not the power of self-government) of\r\nthe adults (of twenty-one years of age) living at one moment, a majority\r\nof whom act for the society, one half will be dead in eighteen years\r\nand eight months. At nineteen years then from the date of a contract,\r\nthe majority of the contractors are dead, and their contract with them.\r\nLet this general theory be applied to a particular case. Suppose the\r\nannual births of the State of New York to be twenty-three thousand nine\r\nhundred and ninety-four, the whole number of its inhabitants, according\r\nto Buffon, will be six hundred and seventeen thousand seven hundred\r\nand three, of all ages. Of these there would constantly be two hundred\r\nand sixty-nine thousand two hundred and eighty-six minors, and three\r\nhundred and forty-eight thousand four hundred and seventeen adults, of\r\nwhich last, one hundred and seventy-four thousand two hundred and nine\r\nwill be a majority. Suppose that majority, on the first day of the year\r\n1794, had borrowed a sum of money equal to the fee-simple value of the\r\nState, and to have consumed it in eating, drinking and making merry in\r\ntheir day; or, if you please, in quarrelling and fighting with their\r\nunoffending neighbors. Within eighteen years and eight months, one half\r\nof the adult citizens were dead. Till then, being the majority, they\r\nmight rightfully levy the interest of their debt annually on themselves\r\nand their fellow-revellers, or fellow-champions. But at that period,\r\nsay at this moment, a new majority have come into place, in their\r\nown right, and not under the rights, the conditions, or laws of their\r\npredecessors. Are they bound to acknowledge the debt, to consider the\r\npreceding generation as having had a right to eat up the whole soil\r\nof their country, in the course of a life, to alienate it from them,\r\n(for it would be an alienation to the creditors,) and would they think\r\nthemselves either legally or morally bound to give up their country and\r\nemigrate to another for subsistence? Every one will say no; that the soil\r\nis the gift of God to the living, as much as it had been to the deceased\r\ngeneration; and that the laws of nature impose no obligation on them to\r\npay this debt. And although, like some other natural rights, this has\r\nnot yet entered into any declaration of rights, it is no less a law, and\r\nought to be acted on by honest governments. It is, at the same time,\r\na salutary curb on the spirit of war and indebtment, which, since the\r\nmodern theory of the perpetuation of debt, has drenched the earth with\r\nblood, and crushed its inhabitants under burthens ever accumulating. Had\r\nthis principle been declared in the British bill of rights, England would\r\nhave been placed under the happy disability of waging eternal war, and\r\nof contracting her thousand millions of public debt. In seeking, then,\r\nfor an ultimate term for the redemption of our debts, let us rally to\r\nthis principle, and provide for their payment within the term of nineteen\r\nyears at the farthest. Our government has not, as yet, begun to act on\r\nthe rule of loans and taxation going hand in hand. Had any loan taken\r\nplace in my time, I should have strongly urged a redeeming tax. For the\r\nloan which has been made since the last session of Congress, we should\r\nnow set the example of appropriating some particular tax, sufficient\r\nto pay the interest annually, and the principle within a fixed term,\r\nless than nineteen years. And I hope yourself and your committee will\r\nrender the immortal service of introducing this practice. Not that it\r\nis expected that Congress should formally declare such a principle They\r\nwisely enough avoid deciding on abstract questions. But they may be\r\ninduced to keep themselves within its limits.\r\n\r\nI am sorry to see our loans begin at so exorbitant an interest. And yet,\r\neven at that you will soon be at the bottom of the loan-bag. We are an\r\nagricultural nation. Such an one employs its sparings in the purchase or\r\nimprovement of land or stocks. The lendable money among them is chiefly\r\nthat of orphans and wards in the hands of executors and guardians, and\r\nthat which the farmer lays by till he has enough for the purchase in\r\nview. In such a nation there is one and one only resource for loans,\r\nsufficient to carry them through the expense of a war; and that will\r\nalways be sufficient, and in the power of an honest government, punctual\r\nin the preservation of its faith. The fund I mean, is _the mass of\r\ncirculating coin_. Every one knows, that although not literally, it is\r\nnearly true, that every paper dollar emitted banishes a silver one from\r\nthe circulation. A nation, therefore, making its purchases and payments\r\nwith bills fitted for circulation, thrusts an equal sum of coin out of\r\ncirculation. This is equivalent to borrowing that sum, and yet the vendor\r\nreceiving payment in a medium as effectual as coin for his purchases\r\nor payments, has no claim to interest. And so the nation may continue\r\nto issue its bills as far as its wants require, and the limits of the\r\ncirculation will admit. Those limits are understood to extend with us at\r\npresent, to two hundred millions of dollars, a greater sum than would be\r\nnecessary for any war. But this, the only resource which the government\r\ncould command with certainty, the States have unfortunately fooled away,\r\nnay corruptly alienated to swindlers and shavers, under the cover of\r\nprivate banks. Say, too, as an additional evil, that the disposal funds\r\nof individuals, to this great amount, have thus been withdrawn from\r\nimprovement and useful enterprise, and employed in the useless, usurious\r\nand demoralizing practices of bank directors and their accomplices. In\r\nthe war of 1755, our State availed itself of this fund by issuing a paper\r\nmoney, bottomed on a specific tax for its redemption, and, to insure its\r\ncredit, bearing an interest of five per cent. Within a very short time,\r\nnot a bill of this emission was to be found in circulation. It was locked\r\nup in the chests of executors, guardians, widows, farmers, &c. We then\r\nissued bills bottomed on a redeeming tax, but bearing no interest. These\r\nwere readily received, and never depreciated a single farthing. In the\r\nrevolutionary war, the old Congress and the States issued bills without\r\ninterest, and without tax. They occupied the channels of circulation very\r\nfreely, till those channels were overflowed by an excess beyond all the\r\ncalls of circulation. But although we have so improvidently suffered the\r\nfield of circulating medium to be filched from us by private individuals,\r\nyet I think we may recover it in part, and even in the whole, if the\r\nStates will co-operate with us. If treasury bills are emitted on a tax\r\nappropriated for their redemption in fifteen years, and (to insure\r\npreference in the first moments of competition) bearing an interest\r\nof six per cent. there is no one who would not take them in preference\r\nto the bank paper now afloat, on a principle of patriotism as well as\r\ninterest; and they would be withdrawn from circulation into private\r\nhoards to a considerable amount. Their credit once established, others\r\nmight be emitted, bottomed also on a tax, but not bearing interest; and\r\nif ever their credit faltered, open public loans, on which these bills\r\nalone should be received as specie. These, operating as a sinking fund,\r\nwould reduce the quantity in circulation, so as to maintain that in an\r\nequilibrium with specie. It is not easy to estimate the obstacles which,\r\nin the beginning, we should encounter in ousting the banks from their\r\npossession of the circulation; but a steady and judicious alternation of\r\nemissions and loans, would reduce them in time. But while this is going\r\non, another measure should be pressed, to recover ultimately our right to\r\nthe circulation. The States should be applied to, to transfer the right\r\nof issuing circulating paper to Congress exclusively, _in perpetuum_, if\r\npossible, but during the war at least, with a saving of charter rights.\r\nI believe that every State west and South of Connecticut river, except\r\nDelaware, would immediately do it; and the others would follow in time.\r\nCongress would, of course, begin by obliging unchartered banks to wind\r\nup their affairs within a short time, and the others as their charters\r\nexpired, forbidding the subsequent circulation of their paper. This they\r\nwould supply with their own, bottomed, every emission, on an adequate\r\ntax, and bearing or not bearing interest, as the state of the public\r\npulse should indicate. Even in the non-complying States, these bills\r\nwould make their way, and supplant the unfunded paper of their banks,\r\nby their solidity, by the universality of their currency, and by their\r\nreceivability for customs and taxes. It would be in their power, too, to\r\ncurtail those banks to the amount of their actual specie, by gathering\r\nup their paper, and running it constantly on them. The national paper\r\nmight thus take place even in the non-complying States. In this way,\r\nI am not without a hope, that this great, this sole resource for loans\r\nin an agricultural country, might yet be recovered for the use of the\r\nnation during war; and, if obtained _in perpetuum_, it would always be\r\nsufficient to carry us through any war; provided, that in the interval\r\nbetween war and war, all the outstanding paper should be called in,\r\ncoin be permitted to flow in again, and to hold the field of circulation\r\nuntil another war should require its yielding place again to the national\r\nmedium.\r\n\r\nBut it will be asked, are we to have no banks? Are merchants and others to\r\nbe deprived of the resource of short accommodations, found so convenient?\r\nI answer, let us have banks; but let them be such as are alone to be\r\nfound in any country on earth, except Great Britain. There is not a\r\nbank of discount on the continent of Europe, (at least there was not\r\none when I was there,) which offers anything but cash in exchange for\r\ndiscounted bills. No one has a natural right to the trade of a money\r\nlender, but he who has the money to lend. Let those then among us, who\r\nhave a monied capital, and who prefer employing it in loans rather than\r\notherwise, set up banks, and give cash or national bills for the notes\r\nthey discount. Perhaps, to encourage them, a larger interest than is\r\nlegal in the other cases might be allowed them, on the condition of\r\ntheir lending for short periods only. It is from Great Britain we copy\r\nthe idea of giving paper in exchange for discounted bills; and while we\r\nhave derived from that country some good principles of government and\r\nlegislation, we unfortunately run into the most servile imitation of all\r\nher practices, ruinous as they prove to her, and with the gulph yawning\r\nbefore us into which these very practices are precipitating her. The\r\nunlimited emission of bank paper has banished all her specie, and is\r\nnow, by a depreciation acknowledged by her own statesmen, carrying her\r\nrapidly to bankruptcy, as it did France, as it did us, and will do us\r\nagain, and every country permitting paper to be circulated, other than\r\nthat by public authority, rigorously limited to the just measure for\r\ncirculation. Private fortunes, in the present state of our circulation,\r\nare at the mercy of those self-created money lenders, and are prostrated\r\nby the floods of nominal money with which their avarice deluges us.\r\nHe who lent his money to the public or to an individual, before the\r\ninstitution of the United States Bank, twenty years ago, when wheat was\r\nwell sold at a dollar the bushel, and receives now his nominal sum when\r\nit sells at two dollars, is cheated of half his fortune; and by whom? By\r\nthe banks, which, since that, have thrown into circulation ten dollars\r\nof their nominal money where was one at that time.\r\n\r\nReflect, if you please, on these ideas, and use them or not as they\r\nappear to merit. They comfort me in the belief, that they point out a\r\nresource ample enough, without overwhelming war taxes, for the expense\r\nof the war, and possibly still recoverable; and that they hold up to\r\nall future time a resource within ourselves, ever at the command of\r\ngovernment, and competent to any wars into which we may be forced. Nor\r\nis it a slight object to equalize taxes through peace and war.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEver affectionately yours\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n                                                 MONTICELLO, June 27, 1813.\r\n\r\n     Ιδαν ες πολυδενδρον ανηρ ὑλητομος ελθων\r\n     Παπταινει, παρεοντος αδην, ποθεν αρξεται εργου\r\n     Τι πρατον καταλεξω; επει παρα μυρια ειπην.\r\n\r\nAnd I too, my dear Sir, like the wood-cutter of Ida, should doubt where\r\nto begin, were I to enter the forest of opinions, discussions, and\r\ncontentions which have occurred in our day. I should say with Theocritus,\r\nΤι πρατον καταλεξω; επει παρα μυρια ειπην. But I shall not do it.\r\nThe _summum bonum_ with me is now truly epicurian, ease of body and\r\ntranquillity of mind; and to these I wish to consign my remaining days.\r\nMen have differed in opinion, and been divided into parties by these\r\nopinions, from the first origin of societies, and in all governments\r\nwhere they have been permitted freely to think and to speak. The same\r\npolitical parties which now agitate the United States, have existed\r\nthrough all time. Whether the power of the people or that of the αριστοι\r\nshould prevail, were questions which kept the States of Greece and Rome\r\nin eternal convulsions, as they now schismatize every people whose minds\r\nand mouths are not shut up by the gag of a despot. And in fact, the terms\r\nof whig and tory belong to natural as well as to civil history. They\r\ndenote the temper and constitution of mind of different individuals. To\r\ncome to our own country, and to the times when you and I became first\r\nacquainted, we well remember the violent parties which agitated the old\r\nCongress, and their bitter contests. There you and I were together, and\r\nthe Jays, and the Dickinsons, and other anti-independents, were arrayed\r\nagainst us. They cherished the monarchy of England, and we the rights\r\nof our countrymen. When our present government was in the mew, passing\r\nfrom Confederation to Union, how bitter was the schism between the\r\nFeds and Antis. Here you and I were together again. For although, for\r\na moment, separated by the Atlantic from the scene of action, I favored\r\nthe opinion that nine States should confirm the constitution, in order\r\nto secure it, and the others hold off until certain amendments, deemed\r\nfavorable to freedom, should be made. I rallied in the first instant\r\nto the wiser proposition of Massachusetts, that all should confirm,\r\nand then all instruct their delegates to urge those amendments. The\r\namendments were made, and all were reconciled to the government. But as\r\nsoon as it was put into motion, the line of division was again drawn. We\r\nbroke into two parties, each wishing to give the government a different\r\ndirection; the one to strengthen the most popular branch, the other the\r\nmore permanent branches, and to extend their permanence. Here you and I\r\nseparated for the first time, and as we had been longer than most others\r\non the public theatre, and our names therefore were more familiar to our\r\ncountrymen, the party which considered you as thinking with them, placed\r\nyour name at their head; the other, for the same reason, selected mine.\r\nBut neither decency nor inclination permitted us to become the advocates\r\nof ourselves, or to take part personally in the violent contests which\r\nfollowed. We suffered ourselves, as you so well expressed it, to be\r\npassive subjects of public discussion. And these discussions, whether\r\nrelating to men, measures or opinions, were conducted by the parties\r\nwith an animosity, a bitterness and an indecency which had never been\r\nexceeded. All the resources of reason and of wrath were exhausted by each\r\nparty in support of its own, and to prostrate the adversary opinions;\r\none was upbraided with receiving the anti-federalists, the other the\r\nold tories and refugees, into their bosom. Of this acrimony, the public\r\npapers of the day exhibit ample testimony, in the debates of Congress,\r\nof State Legislatures, of stump-orators, in addresses, answers, and\r\nnewspaper essays; and to these, without question, may be added the\r\nprivate correspondences of individuals; and the less guarded in these,\r\nbecause not meant for the public eye, not restrained by the respect\r\ndue to that, but poured forth from the overflowings of the heart into\r\nthe bosom of a friend, as a momentary easement of our feelings. In this\r\nway, and in answers to addresses, you and I could indulge ourselves. We\r\nhave probably done it, sometimes with warmth, often with prejudice, but\r\nalways, as we believed, adhering to truth. I have not examined my letters\r\nof that day. I have no stomach to revive the memory of its feelings. But\r\none of these letters, it seems, has got before the public, by accident\r\nand infidelity, by the death of one friend to whom it was written, and\r\nof his friend to whom it had been communicated, and by the malice and\r\ntreachery of a third person, of whom I had never before heard, merely to\r\nmake mischief, and in the same satanic spirit in which the same enemy\r\nhad intercepted and published, in 1776, your letter animadverting on\r\nDickinson's character. How it happened that I quoted you in my letter\r\nto Doctor Priestley, and for whom, and not for yourself, the strictures\r\nwere meant, has been explained to you in my letter of the 15th, which\r\nhad been committed to the post eight days before I received yours of the\r\n10th, 11th and 14th. That gave you the reference which these asked to\r\nthe particular answer alluded to in the one to Priestley. The renewal of\r\nthese old discussions, my friend, would be equally useless and irksome.\r\nTo the volumes then written on these subjects, human ingenuity can add\r\nnothing new, and the rather, as lapse of time has obliterated many of\r\nthe facts. And shall you and I, my dear Sir, at our age, like Priam of\r\nold, gird on the _arma, diu desueta, trementibus œvo humeris_? Shall\r\nwe, at our age, become the Athletæ of party, and exhibit ourselves as\r\ngladiators in the arena of the newspapers? Nothing in the universe could\r\ninduce me to it. My mind has been long fixed to bow to the judgment of\r\nthe world, who will judge by my acts, and will never take counsel from\r\nme as to what that judgment shall be. If your objects and opinions have\r\nbeen misunderstood, if the measures and principles of others have been\r\nwrongfully imputed to you, as I believe they have been, that you should\r\nleave an explanation of them, would be an act of justice to yourself. I\r\nwill add, that it has been hoped that you would leave such explanations\r\nas would place every saddle on its right horse, and replace on the\r\nshoulders of others the burthens they shifted on yours.\r\n\r\nBut all this, my friend, is offered, merely for your consideration and\r\njudgment, without presuming to anticipate what you alone are qualified\r\nto decide for yourself. I mean to express my own purpose only, and the\r\nreflections which have led to it. To me, then, it appears, that there\r\nhave been differences of opinion and party differences, from the first\r\nestablishment of governments to the present day, and on the same question\r\nwhich now divides our own country; that these will continue through all\r\nfuture time; that every one takes his side in favor of the many, or of\r\nthe few, according to his constitution, and the circumstances in which\r\nhe is placed; that opinions, which are equally honest on both sides,\r\nshould not affect personal esteem or social intercourse; that as we judge\r\nbetween the Claudii and the Gracchi, the Wentworths and the Hampdens of\r\npast ages, so of those among us whose names may happen to be remembered\r\nfor awhile, the next generations will judge, favorably or unfavorably,\r\naccording to the complexion of individual minds, and the side they shall\r\nthemselves have taken; that nothing new can be added by you or me to\r\nwhat has been said by others, and will be said in every age in support\r\nof the conflicting opinions on government; and that wisdom and duty\r\ndictate an humble resignation to the verdict of our future peers. In\r\ndoing this myself, I shall certainly not suffer moot questions to affect\r\nthe sentiments of sincere friendship and respect, consecrated to you by\r\nso long a course of time, and of which I now repeat sincere assurances.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS TO THOMAS JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n                                                     QUINCY, June 28, 1813.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I know not what, unless it were the prophet of Tippecanoe,\r\nhad turned my curiosity to inquiries after the metaphysical science\r\nof the Indians, their ecclesiastical establishments, and theological\r\ntheories; but your letter, written with all the accuracy, perpiscuity,\r\nand elegance of your youth and middle age, as it has given me great\r\nsatisfaction, deserves my best thanks.\r\n\r\nIt has given me satisfaction, because, while it has furnished me with\r\ninformation _where_ all the knowledge is to be obtained that books\r\nafford, it has convinced me that I shall never know much more of the\r\nsubject than I do now. As I have never aimed at making my collection of\r\nbooks upon this subject, I have none of those you abridged in so concise\r\na manner. Lafitan Adair, and De Bry, were known to me only by name.\r\n\r\nThe various ingenuity which has been displayed in inventions of\r\nhypothesis, to account for the original population of America, and the\r\nimmensity of learning profusely expended to support them, have appeared to\r\nme for a longer time than I can precisely recollect, what the physicians\r\ncall the _Literæ nihil Sanantes_. Whether serpents teeth were sown here\r\nand sprang up men; whether men and women dropped from the clouds upon\r\nthis Atlantic Island; whether the Almighty created them here, or whether\r\nthey emigrated from Europe, are questions of no moment to the present or\r\nfuture happiness of man. Neither agriculture, commerce, manufactures,\r\nfisheries, science, literature, taste, religion, morals, nor any other\r\ngood will be promoted, or any evil averted, by any discoveries that can\r\nbe made in answer to these questions.\r\n\r\nThe opinions of the Indians and their usages, as they are represented\r\nin your obliging letter of the 11th of June, appear to me to resemble\r\nthe Platonizing Philo, or the Philonizing Plato, more than the genuine\r\nsystem of Indianism.\r\n\r\nThe philosophy both of Philo and Plato are at least as absurd. It is\r\nindeed less intelligible.\r\n\r\nPlato borrowed his doctrines from Oriental and Egyptian philosophers,\r\nfor he had travelled both in India and Egypt.\r\n\r\nThe Oriental philosophy, imitated and adopted, in part, if not the whole,\r\nby Plato and Philo, was\r\n\r\n1. One God the good.\r\n\r\n2. The ideas, the thoughts, the reason, the intellect, the logos, the\r\nratio of God.\r\n\r\n3. Matter, the universe, the production of the logos, or contemplations\r\nof God. This matter was the source of evil.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the three powers of Plato, Philo, the Egyptians, and Indians,\r\ncannot be distinctly made out, from your account of the Indians, but--\r\n\r\n1. The great spirit, the good, who is worshipped by the kings, sachems,\r\nand all the great men, in their solemn festivals, as the Author, the\r\nParent of good.\r\n\r\n2. The Devil, or the source of evil. They are not metaphysicians enough\r\nas yet to suppose it, or at least to call it matter, like the wiscains\r\nof Antiquity, and like Frederick the Great who has written a very silly\r\nessay on the origin of evil, in which he ascribes it all to matter, as\r\nif this was an original discovery of his own.\r\n\r\nThe watchmaker has in his head an idea of the system of a watch before\r\nhe makes it. The mechanician of the universe had a complete idea of the\r\nuniverse before he made it; and this idea, this logos, was almighty, or\r\nat least powerful enough to produce the world, but it must be made of\r\nmatter which was eternal; for creation out of nothing was impossible.\r\nAnd matter was unmanageable. It would not, and could not be fashioned\r\ninto any system, without a large mixture of evil in it; for matter was\r\nessentially evil.\r\n\r\nThe Indians are not metaphysicians enough to have discovered this _idea_,\r\nthis logos, this intermediate power between good and evil, God and matter.\r\nBut of the two powers, the good and the evil, they seem to have a full\r\nconviction; and what son or daughter of Adam and Eve has not?\r\n\r\nThis logos of Plato seems to resemble, if it was not the prototype of,\r\nthe _Ratio and its Progress_ of Manilius, the astrologer; of the _Progress\r\nof the Mind_ of Condorcet, and the _Age of Reason_ of Tom Payne.\r\n\r\nI could make a system too. The seven hundred thousand soldiers of Zingis,\r\nwhen the whole, or any part of them went to battle, they sent up a howl,\r\nwhich resembled nothing that human imagination has conceived, unless it\r\nbe the supposition that all the devils in hell were let loose at once\r\nto set up an infernal scream, which terrified their enemies, and never\r\nfailed to obtain them victory. The Indian yell resembles this; and,\r\ntherefore, America was peopled from Asia.\r\n\r\nAnother system. The armies of Zingis, sometimes two or three or four\r\nhundred thousand of them, surrounded a province in a circle, and marched\r\ntowards the centre, driving all the wild beasts before them, lions,\r\ntigers, wolves, bears, and every living thing, terrifying them with their\r\nhowls and yells, their drums, trumpets, &c., till they terrified and\r\ntamed enough of them to victual the whole army. Therefore, the Scotch\r\nHighlanders, who practice the same thing in miniature, are emigrants\r\nfrom Asia. Therefore, the American Indians, who, for anything I know,\r\npractice the same custom, are emigrants from Asia or Scotland.\r\n\r\nI am weary of contemplating nations from the lowest and most beastly\r\ndegradations of human life, to the highest refinement of civilization. I\r\nam weary of Philosophers, Theologians, Politicians, and Historians. They\r\nare an immense mass of absurdities, vices, and lies. Montesquieu had sense\r\nenough to say in jest, that all our knowledge might be comprehended in\r\ntwelve pages in duodecimo, and I believe him in earnest. I could express\r\nmy faith in shorter terms. He who loves the workman and his work, and\r\ndoes what he can to preserve and improve it, shall be accepted of him.\r\n\r\nI have also felt an interest in the Indians, and a commiseration for\r\nthem from my childhood. Aaron Pomham the priest, and Moses Pomham the\r\nking of the Punkapang and Neponset tribes, were frequent visitors at my\r\nfather's house, at least seventy years ago. I have a distinct remembrance\r\nof their forms and figures. They were very aged, and the tallest and\r\nstoutest Indians I have ever seen. The titles of king and priest, and the\r\nnames of Moses and Aaron, were given them no doubt by our Massachusetts\r\ndivines and statesmen. There was a numerous family in this town, whose\r\nwigwam was within a mile of this house. This family were frequently\r\nat my father's house, and I, in my boyish rambles, used to call at\r\ntheir wigwam, where I never failed to be treated with whortleberries,\r\nblackberries, strawberries or apples, plums, peaches, &c., for they had\r\nplanted a variety of fruit trees about them. But the girls went out to\r\nservice, and the boys to sea, till not a soul is left. We scarcely see\r\nan Indian in a year. I remember the time when Indian murder, scalpings,\r\ndepredations and conflagrations, were as frequent on the Eastern and\r\nNorthern frontier of Massachusetts, as they are now in Indiana, and\r\nspread as much terror. But since the conquest of Canada, all has ceased;\r\nand I believe with you that another conquest of Canada will quiet the\r\nIndians forever, and be as great a blessing to them as to us.\r\n\r\nThe instance of Aaron Pomham made me suspect that there was an order of\r\npriesthood among them. But, according to your account, the worship of the\r\ngood spirit was performed by the kings, sachems, and warriors, as among\r\nthe ancient Germans, whose highest rank of nobility were priests. The\r\nworship of the evil spirit, Αθανατους μὲν πρωτα θεους νομῳ ως διακειται\r\nτιμα.\r\n\r\nWe have war now in earnest. I lament the contumacious spirit that appears\r\nabout me. But I lament the cause that has given too much apology for it;\r\nthe total neglect and absolute refusal of all maritime protection and\r\ndefence. Money, mariners, and soldiers, would be at the public service,\r\nif only a few frigates had been ordered to be built. Without this, our\r\nUnion will be a brittle china vase, a house of ice, or a palace of glass.\r\n\r\nI am, Sir, with an affectionate respect, yours\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS TO THOMAS JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n                                                     QUINCY, June 28, 1813.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--It is very true that the denunciations of the priesthood are\r\nfulminated against every advocate for a complete freedom of religion.\r\nComminations, I believe, would be plenteously pronounced by even the\r\nmost liberal of them, against Atheism, Deism, against every man who\r\ndisbelieved or doubted the resurrection of Jesus, or the miracles of\r\nthe New Testament. Priestley himself would denounce the man who should\r\ndeny the Apocalypse, or the Prophecies of Daniel. Priestley and Lindsay\r\nboth have denounced as idolaters and blasphemers all the Trinitarians,\r\nand even the Arians.\r\n\r\nPoor weak man, when will thy perfection arrive? Thy perfectability I\r\nshall not deny; for a greater character than Priestley or Godwin has\r\nsaid, \"Be ye perfect,\" &c. For my part I can not deal damnation round\r\nthe land on all I judge the foes of God and man. But I did not intend to\r\nsay a word on this subject in this letter. As much of it as you please\r\nhereafter, but let me return to politics.\r\n\r\nWith some difficulty I have hunted up, or down, the \"address of the\r\nyoung men of the city of Philadelphia, the district of Southwark, and\r\nthe Northern Liberties,\" and the answer.\r\n\r\nThe addresses say, \"Actuated by the same principles on which our\r\nforefathers achieved their independence, the recent attempts of a\r\nforeign power to derogate from the dignity and rights of our country,\r\nawaken our liveliest sensibility, and our strongest indignation.\" Huzza\r\nmy brave boys! Could Thomas Jefferson or John Adams hear those words\r\nwith insensibility, and without emotion? These boys afterwards add, \"We\r\nregard our liberty and independence as the richest portion given us by\r\nour ancestors.\" And who were those ancestors? Among them were Thomas\r\nJefferson and John Adams. And I very coolly believe that no two men\r\namong those ancestors did more towards it than those two. Could either\r\nhear this like statues? If, one hundred years hence, your letters and\r\nmine should see the light, I hope the reader will hunt up this address,\r\nand read it all; and remember that we were then engaged, or on the point\r\nof engaging, in a war with France. I shall not repeat the answer till\r\nwe come to the paragraph upon which you criticised to Dr. Priestley,\r\nthough every word of it is true, and I now rejoice to see it recorded,\r\nand though I had wholly forgotten it.\r\n\r\nThe paragraph is, \"Science and morals are the great pillars on which\r\nthis country has been raised to its present population, opulence and\r\nprosperity, and these alone can advance, support, and preserve it.\r\nWithout wishing to damp the ardor of curiosity, or influence the freedom\r\nof inquiry, I will hazard a prediction that, after the most industrious\r\nand impartial researches, the longest liver of you all will find no\r\nprinciples, institutions, or systems of education more fit, IN GENERAL,\r\nto be transmitted to your posterity than those you have received from\r\nyour ancestors.\"\r\n\r\nNow, compare the paragraph in the answer with the paragraph in the\r\naddress, as both are quoted above, and see if we can find the extent\r\nand the limits of the meaning of both.\r\n\r\nWho composed that army of fine young fellows that was then before my\r\neyes? There were among them Roman Catholics, English Episcopalians,\r\nScotch and American Presbyterians, Methodists, Moravians, Anabaptists,\r\nGerman Lutherans, German Calvinists, Universalists, Arians, Priestleyans,\r\nSocinians, Independents, Congregationalists, Horse Protestants and House\r\nProtestants, Deists and Atheists; and \"Protestans qui ne croyent rien.\"\r\nVery few however of several of these species. Nevertheless, all educated\r\nin the GENERAL PRINCIPLES of Christianity; and the general principles\r\nof English and American liberty.\r\n\r\nCould my answer be understood by any candid reader or hearer, to recommend\r\nto all the others the general principles, institutions, or systems of\r\neducation of the Roman Catholics? Or those of the Quakers? Or those of\r\nthe Presbyterians? Or those of the Menonists? Or those of the Methodists?\r\nOr those of the Moravians? Or those of the Universalists? Or those of\r\nthe Philosophers? No.\r\n\r\nThe GENERAL PRINCIPLES on which the fathers achieved independence, were\r\nthe only principles in which that beautiful assembly of young gentlemen\r\ncould unite, and these principles only could be intended by them in\r\ntheir address, or by me in my answer.\r\n\r\nAnd what were these GENERAL PRINCIPLES? I answer, the general principles\r\nof Christianity, in which all those sects were united; and the GENERAL\r\nPRINCIPLES of English and American liberty, in which all these young\r\nmen united, and which had united all parties in America, in majorities\r\nsufficient to assert and maintain her independence.\r\n\r\nNow I will avow that I then believed, and now believe, that those\r\ngeneral principles of Christianity are as eternal and immutable as the\r\nexistence and attributes of God; and that those principles of liberty\r\nare as unalterable as human nature, and our terrestrial mundane system.\r\nI could therefore safely say, consistently with all my then and present\r\ninformation, that I believed they would never make discoveries in\r\ncontradiction to these GENERAL PRINCIPLES. In favor of these GENERAL\r\nPRINCIPLES in philosophy, religion and government, I would fill sheets\r\nof quotations from Frederick of Prussia, from Hume, Gibbon, Bolingbroke,\r\nRousseau and Voltaire, as well as Newton and Locke; not to mention\r\nthousands of divines and philosophers of inferior fame.\r\n\r\nI might have flattered myself that my sentiments were sufficiently known\r\nto have protected me against suspicions of narrow thoughts, contracted\r\nsentiments, bigoted, enthusiastic, or superstitious principles, civil,\r\npolitical, philosophical, or ecclesiastical. The first sentence of the\r\npreface to my defence of the constitution, vol. 1st, printed in 1787,\r\nis in these words: \"The arts and sciences, in general, during the three\r\nor four last centuries, have had a regular course of _progressive_\r\nimprovement. The inventions in mechanic arts, the discoveries in natural\r\nphilosophy, navigation, and commerce, and the advancement of civilization\r\nand humanity, have occasioned changes in the condition of the world\r\nand the human character, which would have astonished the most refined\r\nnations of antiquity,\" &c. I will quote no farther; but request you\r\nto read again that whole page, and then say whether the writer of it\r\ncould be suspected of recommending to youth \"to look backward instead\r\nof forward\" for instruction and improvement.\r\n\r\nThis letter is already too long. In my next I shall consider the Terrorism\r\nof the day. Meantime I am, as ever, your friend\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DOCTOR JOHN L. E. W. SHECUT.\r\n\r\n                                                 MONTICELLO, June 29, 1813.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I am very sensible of the honor done me by the Antiquarian Society\r\nof Charleston, in the Rule for the organization of their Society, which\r\nyou have been so good as to communicate, and I pray you to do me the\r\nfavor of presenting to them my thanks. Age, and my inland and retired\r\nsituation, make it scarcely probable that I shall be able to render them\r\nany services. But, should any occasion occur wherein I can be useful\r\nto them, I shall receive their commands with pleasure, and execute\r\nthem with fidelity. While the promotion of the arts and sciences is\r\ninteresting to every nation, and at all times, it becomes peculiarly so\r\nto ours, at this time, when the total demoralization of the governments\r\nof Europe, has rendered it safest, by cherishing internal resources,\r\nto lessen the occasions of intercourse with them. The works of our\r\naboriginal inhabitants have been so perishable, that much of them must\r\nhave disappeared already. The antiquarian researches, therefore, of\r\nthe Society, cannot be too soon, or too assiduously directed, to the\r\ncollecting and preserving what still remain.\r\n\r\nPermit me to place here my particular thankfulness for the kind sentiments\r\nof personal regard which you have been pleased to express.\r\n\r\nI have been in the constant hope of seeing the second volume of your\r\nexcellent botanical work. Its alphabetical form and popular style, its\r\nattention to the properties and uses of plants, as well as to their\r\ndescriptions, are well calculated to encourage and instruct our citizens\r\nin botanical inquiries.\r\n\r\nI avail myself of this occasion, of enclosing you a little of the fruit\r\nof a _Capsicum_ I have just received from the province of Texas, where\r\nit is indigenous and perennial, and is used as freely as salt by the\r\ninhabitants. It is new to me. It differs from your _Capsicum Minimum_,\r\nin being perennial and probably hardier; perhaps, too, in its size,\r\nwhich would claim the term of _Minutissimum_. This stimulant being found\r\nsalutary in a visceral complaint known on the sea-coast, the introduction\r\nof a hardier variety may be of value. Accept the assurance of my great\r\nrespect and consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS TO THOMAS JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n                                                     QUINCY, June 30, 1813.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--* * * * *\r\n\r\nBut to return, _for the present_, to \"The sensations excited in free,\r\nyet firm minds by the Terrorism of the day.\" You say none can conceive\r\nthem who did not witness them; and they were felt by one party only.\r\n\r\nUpon this subject I despair of making myself understood by posterity, by\r\nthe present age, and even by you. To collect and arrange the documents\r\nillustrative of it, would require as many lives as those of a cat. You\r\nnever felt the terrorism of Chaise's Rebellion in Massachusetts. I believe\r\nyou never felt the terrorism of Gallatin's insurrection in Pennsylvania.\r\nYou certainly never realized the terrorism of Tries's most outrageous\r\nriot and rescue, as I call it. Treason, rebellion--as the world, and\r\ngreat judges, and two juries pronounce it.\r\n\r\nYou certainly never felt the terrorism excited by Genet in 1793, when\r\nten thousand people in the streets of Philadelphia, day after day,\r\nthreatened to drag Washington out of his house, and effect a revolution\r\nin the government, or compel it to declare war in favor of the French\r\nrevolution, and against England. The coolest and the firmest minds,\r\neven among the Quakers in Philadelphia, have given their opinions to\r\nme, that nothing but the yellow fever, which removed Dr. Hutchinson and\r\nJonathan Dickinson Sargent from this world, could have saved the United\r\nStates from a total revolution of government. I have no doubt you were\r\nfast asleep in philosophical tranquillity when ten thousand people, and\r\nperhaps many more, were parading the streets of Philadelphia, on the\r\nevening of my _Fast Day_. When even Governor Mifflin himself, thought\r\nit his duty to order a patrol of horse and foot, to preserve the peace;\r\nwhen Market Street was as full as men could stand by one another, and\r\neven before my door; when some of my domestics, in phrenzy, determined\r\nto sacrifice their lives in my defence; when all were ready to make a\r\ndesperate sally among the multitude, and others were with difficulty and\r\ndanger dragged back by the others; when I myself judged it prudent and\r\nnecessary to order chests of arms from the war office, to be brought\r\nthrough by lanes and back doors; determined to defend my house at the\r\nexpense of my life, and the lives of the few, very few, domestics and\r\nfriends within it. What think you of terrorism, Mr. Jefferson? Shall I\r\ninvestigate the causes, the motives, the incentives to these terrorisms?\r\nShall I remind you of Phillip Freneau, of Loyd, of Ned Church? Of\r\nPeter Markoe, of Andrew Brown, of Duane? Of Callender, of Tom Paine, of\r\nGreenleaf, of Cheatham, of Tennison at New York, of Benjamin Austin at\r\nBoston?\r\n\r\nBut above all, shall I request you to collect circular letters\r\nfrom members of Congress in the middle and southern States to their\r\nconstituents? I would give all I am worth for a complete collection of\r\nall those circular letters. Please to recollect Edward Livingston's\r\nmotions and speeches, and those of his associates, in the case of\r\nJonathan Robbins. The real terrors of both parties have always been, and\r\nnow are, the fear that they shall lose the elections, and consequently\r\nthe loaves and fishes; and that their antagonists will obtain them.\r\nBoth parties have excited artificial terrors, and if I were summoned as\r\na witness to say, upon oath, which party had excited, Machiavillialy,\r\nthe most terror, and which had really felt the most, I could not give\r\na more sincere answer than in the vulgar style, put them in a bag and\r\nshake them, and then see which comes out first.\r\n\r\nWhere is the terrorism now, my friend? There is now more real terrorism\r\nin New England than there ever was in Virginia. The terror of a civil\r\nwar, _à La Vendee_, a division of the States, &c., &c., &c. How shall we\r\nconjure down this damnable rivalry between Virginia and Massachusetts?\r\nVirginia had recourse to Pennsylvania and New York. Massachusetts has\r\nnow recourse to New York. They have almost got New Jersey and Maryland,\r\nand they are aiming at Pennsylvania. And all this in the midst of a war\r\nwith England, when all Europe is in flames.\r\n\r\nI will give you a hint or two more on the subject of terrorism. When John\r\nRandolph in the House, and Stephens Thompson Mason in the Senate, were\r\ntreating me with the utmost contempt; when Ned Livingston was threatening\r\nme with impeachment for the murder of Jonathan Robbins, _the native of\r\nDanvers in Connecticut_; when I had certain information, that the daily\r\nlanguage in an Insurance Office in Boston was, even from the mouth of\r\nCharles Jarvis, \"We must go to Philadelphia and drag that John Adams from\r\nhis chair;\" I thank God that terror never yet seized on my mind. But I\r\nhave had more excitements to it, from 1761 to this day, than any other\r\nman. Name the other if you can. I have been disgraced and degraded, and\r\nI have a right to complain. But as I always expected it, I have always\r\nsubmitted to it; perhaps often with too much tameness. The amount of all\r\nthe speeches of John Randolph in the House, for two or three years is,\r\nthat himself and myself are the only two honest and consistent men in\r\nthe United States. Himself eternally in opposition to government, and\r\nmyself as constantly in favor of it. He is now in correspondence with\r\nhis friend Quincy. What will come of it, let Virginia and Massachusetts\r\njudge. In my next you may find something upon correspondences; Whig\r\nand Tory; Federal and Democratic; Virginian and Novanglian; English and\r\nFrench; Jacobinic and Despotic, &c.\r\n\r\nMeantime I am as ever, your friend.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS TO THOMAS JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n                                                        QUINCY, July, 1813.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Correspondences! The letters of Bernard and Hutchinson, and\r\nOliver and Paxton, &c., were detected and exposed before the Revolution.\r\nThere are, I doubt not, thousands of letters now in being, (but still\r\nconcealed from their party,) to their friends, which will, one day, see\r\nthe light. I have wondered for more than thirty years, that so few have\r\nappeared; and have constantly expected that a Tory History of the rise\r\nand progress of the Revolution would appear; and wished it. I would\r\ngive more for it than for Marshall, Gordon, Ramsay, and all the rest.\r\nPrivate letters of all parties will be found analogous to the newspapers,\r\npamphlets, and historians of the times. Gordon's and Marshall's histories\r\nwere written to make money; and fashioned and finished to sell high\r\nin the London market. I should expect to find more truth in a history\r\nwritten by Hutchinson, Oliver, or Sewall; and I doubt not, such histories\r\nwill one day appear. Marshall's is a Mausolæum, 100 feet square at the\r\nbase, and 200 feet high. It will be as durable as the monuments of the\r\nWashington benevolent societies. Your character in history may easily\r\nbe foreseen. Your administration will be quoted by philosophers as a\r\nmodel of profound wisdom; by politicians, as weak, superficial, and\r\nshort sighted. Mine, like Pope's woman, will have no character at all.\r\nThe impious idolatry to Washington destroyed all character. His legacy\r\nof ministers was not the worst part of the tragedy; though by his own\r\nexpress confession to me, and by Pickering's confession to the world, in\r\nhis letters to Sullivan, two of them, at least, were fastened upon him\r\nby necessity, because he could get no other. The truth is, Hamilton's\r\ninfluence over him was so well known, that no man fit for the office\r\nof State or War would accept either. He was driven to the necessity of\r\nappointing such as would accept; and this necessity was, in my opinion,\r\nthe real cause of his retirement from office; for you may depend upon\r\nit, that retirement was not voluntary.\r\n\r\nMy friend, you and I have passed our lives in serious times. I know not\r\nwhether we have ever seen any moments more serious than the present.\r\nThe Northern States are now retaliating upon the Southern States their\r\nconduct from 1797 to 1800. It is a mortification to me to see what\r\nservile mimics they are. Their newspapers, pamphlets, hand-bills, and\r\ntheir legislative proceedings, are copied from the examples set them,\r\nespecially by Virginia and Kentucky. I know not which party has the\r\nmost unblushing front, the most lying tongue, or the most impudent and\r\ninsolent, not to say the most seditious and rebellious pen.\r\n\r\nIf you desire explanation on any of the points in this letter, you shall\r\nhave them. This correspondence, I hope, will be concealed as long as\r\nHutchinson's and Oliver's; but I should have no personal objection to\r\nthe publication of it in the National Intelligencer. I am, and shall be\r\nfor life, your friend.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS TO THOMAS JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n                                                      QUINCY, July 9, 1813.\r\n\r\nLord! Lord! What can I do with so much Greek? When I was of your age,\r\nyoung man, _i. e._, seven, or eight, or nine years ago, I felt a kind\r\nof pang of affection for one of the flames of my youth, and again paid\r\nmy addresses to Isocrates, and Dionysius Hallicarnassensis, &c., &c. I\r\ncollected all my Lexicons and Grammars, and sat down to περὶ συνθησεως\r\nονοματων, &c. In this way I amused myself for some time; but I found,\r\nthat if I looked a word to-day, in less than a week I had to look it\r\nagain. It was to little better purpose than writing letters on a pail\r\nof water.\r\n\r\nWhenever I set down to write to you, I am precisely in the situation\r\nof the wood-cutter on Mount Ida. I cannot see wood for trees. So many\r\nsubjects crowd upon me, that I know not with which to begin. But I will\r\nbegin, at random, with Belsham; who is, as I have no doubt, a man of\r\nmerit. He had no malice against you, nor any thought of doing mischief;\r\nnor has he done any, though he has been imprudent. The truth is, the\r\ndissenters of all denominations in England, and especially the Unitarians,\r\nare cowed, as we used to say at College. They are ridiculed, insulted,\r\npersecuted. They can scarcely hold their heads above water. They catch\r\nat straws and shadows to avoid drowning. Priestley sent your letter to\r\nLinsay, and Belsham printed it from the same motive, _i. e._ to derive\r\nsome countenance from the name of Jefferson. Nor has it done harm here\r\nPriestley says to Linsay, \"You see he is almost one of us, and he hopes\r\nwill soon be altogether such as we are.\" Even in our New England, I have\r\nheard a high Federal Divine say, your letters had increased his respect\r\nfor you.\r\n\r\n\"The same political parties which now agitate the United States, have\r\nexisted through all time;\" precisely. And this is precisely the complaint\r\nin the preface to the first volume of my defence. While all other\r\nsciences have advanced, that of government is at a stand; little better\r\nunderstood; little better practiced now, than three or four thousand\r\nyears ago. What is the reason? I say, parties and factions will not\r\nsuffer, or permit improvements to be made. As soon as one man hints at\r\nan improvement, his rival opposes it. No sooner has one party discovered\r\nor invented an amelioration of the condition of man, or the order of\r\nsociety, than the opposite party belies it, misconstrues, misrepresents\r\nit, ridicules it, insults it, and persecutes it. Records are destroyed.\r\nHistories are annihilated, or interpolated, or prohibited: sometimes by\r\npopes, sometimes by emperors, sometimes by aristocratical, and sometimes\r\nby democratical assemblies, and sometimes by mobs.\r\n\r\nAristotle wrote the history of eighteen hundred republics which existed\r\nbefore his time. Cicero wrote two volumes of discourses on government,\r\nwhich, perhaps, were worth all the rest of his works. The works of Livy\r\nand Tacitus, &c., that are lost, would be more interesting than all that\r\nremain. Fifty gospels have been destroyed, and where are St. Luke's world\r\nof books that have been written? If you ask my opinion who has committed\r\nall the havoc, I will answer you candidly,--Ecclesiastical and Imperial\r\ndespotism has done it, to conceal their frauds.\r\n\r\nWhy are the histories of all nations, more ancient than the Christian\r\nera, lost? Who destroyed the Alexandrian library? I believe that Christian\r\npriests, Jewish rabbis, Grecian sages, and emperors, had as great a hand\r\nin it as Turks and Mahometans.\r\n\r\nDemocrats, Rebels and Jacobins, when they possessed a momentary power,\r\nhave shown a disposition both to destroy and forge records as vandalical\r\nas priests and despots. Such has been and such is the world we live in.\r\n\r\nI recollect, near some thirty years ago, to have said carelessly to\r\nyou that I wished I could find time and means to write something upon\r\naristocracy. You seized upon the idea, and encouraged me to do it with\r\nall that friendly warmth that is natural and habitual to you. I soon\r\nbegan, and have been writing upon that subject ever since. I have been\r\nso unfortunate as never to be able to make myself understood.\r\n\r\nYour \"ἄριστοι\" are the most difficult animals to manage of anything\r\nin the whole theory and practice of government. They will not suffer\r\nthemselves to be governed. They not only exert all their own subtlety,\r\nindustry and courage, but they employ the commonalty to knock to pieces\r\nevery plan and model that the most honest architects in legislation can\r\ninvent to keep them within bounds. Both patricians and plebeians are as\r\nfurious as the workmen in England, to demolish labor-saving machinery.\r\n\r\nBut who are these \"ἄριστοι\"? Who shall judge? Who shall select these\r\nchoice spirits from the rest of the congregation? Themselves? We must\r\nfirst find out and determine who themselves are. Shall the congregation\r\nchoose? Ask Xenophon; perhaps hereafter I may quote you Greek. Too much in\r\na hurry at present, English must suffice. Xenophon says that the ecclesia\r\nalways chooses the worst men they can find, because none others will do\r\ntheir dirty work. This wicked motive is worse than birth or wealth. Here\r\nI want to quote Greek again. But the day before I received your letter\r\nof June 27th, I gave the book to George Washington Adams, going to the\r\nacademy at Hingham. The title is Ηθικη ποιησις, a collection of moral\r\nsentences from all the most ancient Greek poets. In one of the oldest\r\nof them, I read in Greek, that I cannot repeat, a couplet, the sense\r\nof which was: \"Nobility in men is worth as much as it is in horses,\r\nasses, or rams; but the meanest blooded puppy in the world, if he gets\r\na little money, is as good a man as the best of them.\" Yet birth and\r\nwealth together have prevailed over virtue and talents in all ages. The\r\nmany will acknowledge no other \"ἄριστοι\"\r\n\r\nYour experience of this truth will not much differ from that of your\r\nbest friend.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR ADAMS TO THOMAS JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n                                                     QUINCY, July 13, 1813.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Let me allude to one circumstance more in one of your letters\r\nto me, before I touch upon the subject of religion in your letters to\r\nPriestley.\r\n\r\nThe first time that you and I differed in opinion on any material\r\nquestion, was after your arrival from Europe, and that point was the\r\nFrench revolution.\r\n\r\nYou were well persuaded in your own mind, that the nation would succeed\r\nin establishing a free republican government. I was as well persuaded in\r\nmine, that a project of such a government over five and twenty millions\r\nof people, when four and twenty millions and five hundred thousand of\r\nthem could neither read nor write, was as unnatural, irrational and\r\nimpracticable as it would be over the elephants, lions, tigers, panthers,\r\nwolves and bears in the royal menagerie at Versailles. Napoleon has\r\nlately invented a word which perfectly expresses my opinion, at that\r\ntime and ever since. He calls the project Ideology; and John Randolph,\r\nthough he was, fourteen years ago, as wild an enthusiast for equality\r\nand fraternity as any of them, appears to be now a regenerated proselyte\r\nto Napoleon's opinion and mine, that it was all madness.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks, in their allegorical style, said that the two ladies,\r\nΑριστοκρατια and δημοκρατια, always in a quarrel, disturbed every\r\nneighborhood with their brawls. It is a fine observation of yours, that\r\n\"Whig and Tory belong to natural history.\" Inequalities of mind and\r\nbody are so established by God Almighty, in his constitution of human\r\nnature, that no art or policy can ever plane them down to a level. I\r\nhave never read reasoning more absurd, sophistry more gross, in proof of\r\nthe Athanasian creed, or Transubstantiation, than the subtle labors of\r\nHelvetius and Rousseau, to demonstrate the natural equality of mankind.\r\n_Jus cuique_, the golden rule, do as you would be done by, is all the\r\nequality that can be supported or defended by reason, or reconciled to\r\ncommon sense.\r\n\r\nIt is very true, as you justly observe, I can say nothing new on this or\r\nany other subject of government. But when Lafayette harangued you and me\r\nand John Quincy Adams, through a whole evening in your hotel in the Cul\r\nde Sac, at Paris, and developed the plans then in operation to reform\r\nFrance, though I was as silent as you were, I then thought I could say\r\nsomething new to him.\r\n\r\nIn plain truth, I was astonished at the grossness of his ignorance of\r\ngovernment and history, as I had been for years before, at that of Turgot,\r\nRochefaucault, Condorcet and Franklin. This gross Ideology of them all,\r\nfirst suggested to me the thought and the inclination which I afterwards\r\nhinted to you in London, of writing something upon aristocracy. I was\r\nrestrained for years, by many fearful considerations. Who, and what was\r\nI? A man of no name or consideration in Europe. The manual exercise of\r\nwriting was painful and distressing to me, almost like a blow on the\r\nelbow or knee. My style was habitually negligent, unstudied, unpolished;\r\nI should make enemies of all the French patriots, the Dutch patriots,\r\nthe English republicans, dissenters, reformers, call them what you will;\r\nand what came nearer home to my bosom than all the rest, I knew I should\r\ngive offence to many if not all of my best friends in America, and very\r\nprobably destroy all the little popularity I ever had, in a country where\r\npopularity had more omnipotence than the British Parliament assumed.\r\nWhere should I get the necessary books? What printer or bookseller would\r\nundertake to print such hazardous writings?\r\n\r\nBut when the French assembly of notables met, and I saw that Turgot's\r\n\"government in one centre, and that centre the nation,\" a sentence as\r\nmysterious or as contradictory as the Athanasian creed, was about to\r\ntake place, and when I saw that Shaise's rebellion was about breaking\r\nout in Massachusetts, and when I saw that even my obscure name was often\r\nquoted in France as an advocate for simple democracy, when I saw that the\r\nsympathies in America had caught the French flame, I was determined to\r\nwash my own hands as clean as I could of all this foulness. I had then\r\nstrong forebodings that I was sacrificing all the honors and emoluments\r\nof this life, and so it has happened, but not in so great a degree as\r\nI apprehended.\r\n\r\nIn truth, my defence of the constitutions and \"discourses on Davila,\"\r\nlaid the foundation for that immense unpopularity which fell, like the\r\ntower of Siloam, upon me. Your steady defence of democratical principles,\r\nand your invariable favorable opinion of the French revolution, laid\r\nthe foundation of your unbounded popularity.\r\n\r\n_Sic transit gloria mundi!_ Now I will forfeit my life, if you can find\r\none sentence in my defence of the constitutions, or the discourses on\r\nDavila, which, by a fair construction, can favor the introduction of\r\nhereditary monarchy or aristocracy into America.\r\n\r\nThey were all written to support and strengthen the constitutions of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nThe wood-cutter on Ida, though he was puzzled to find a tree to chop at\r\nfirst, I presume knew how to leave off when he was weary. But I never\r\nknow when to cease when I begin to write to you.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DOCTOR SAMUEL BROWN.\r\n\r\n                                                 MONTICELLO, July 14, 1813.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of May 25th and June 13th have been duly received,\r\nas also the first supply of Capsicum, and the second of the same article\r\nwith other seeds. I shall set great store by the Capsicum, if it is\r\nhardy enough for our climate, the species we have heretofore tried being\r\ntoo tender. The Galvance, too, will be particularly attended to, as it\r\nappears very different from what we cultivate by that name. I have so many\r\ngrandchildren and others who might be endangered by the poison plant,\r\nthat I think the risk overbalances the curiosity of trying it. The most\r\nelegant thing of that kind known is a preparation of the Jamestown weed,\r\nDatura-Stramonium, invented by the French in the time of Robespierre.\r\nEvery man of firmness carried it constantly in his pocket to anticipate\r\nthe Guillotine. It brings on the sleep of death as quietly as fatigue does\r\nthe ordinary sleep, without the least struggle or motion. Condorcet, who\r\nhad recourse to it, was found lifeless on his bed a few minutes after his\r\nlandlady had left him there, and even the slipper which she had observed\r\nhalf suspended on his foot, was not shaken off. It seems far preferable to\r\nthe Venesection of the Romans, the Hemlock of the Greeks, and the Opium\r\nof the Turks. I have never been able to learn what the preparation is,\r\nother than a strong concentration of its lethiferous principle. Could\r\nsuch a medicament be restrained to self-administration, it ought not to\r\nbe kept secret. There are ills in life as desperate as intolerable, to\r\nwhich it would be the rational relief, _e. g._ the inveterate cancer.\r\nAs a relief from tyranny indeed, for which the Romans recurred to it in\r\nthe times of the emperors, it has been a wonder to me that they did not\r\nconsider a poignard in the breast of the tyrant as a better remedy.\r\n\r\nI am sorry to learn that a banditti from our country are taking part in\r\nthe domestic contests of the country adjoining you; and the more so as\r\nfrom the known laxity of execution in our laws, they cannot be punished,\r\nalthough the law has provided punishment. It will give a wrongful hue\r\nto a rightful act of taking possession of Mobile, and will be imputed to\r\nthe national authority as Meranda's enterprise was, because not punished\r\nby it. I fear, too, that the Spaniards are too heavily oppressed by\r\nignorance and superstition for self-government, and whether a change\r\nfrom foreign to domestic despotism will be to their advantage remains\r\nto be seen.\r\n\r\nWe have been unfortunate in our first military essays by land. Our men\r\nare good, but our generals unqualified. Every failure we have incurred\r\nhas been the fault of the general, the men evincing courage in every\r\ninstance. At sea we have rescued our character; but the chief fruit of our\r\nvictories there is to prove to those who have fleets, that the English\r\nare not invincible at sea, as Alexander has proved that Bonaparte is\r\nnot invincible by land. How much to be lamented that the world cannot\r\nunite and destroy these two land and sea monsters! The one drenching\r\nthe earth with human gore, the other ravaging the ocean with lawless\r\npiracies and plunder. Bonaparte will die, and the nations of Europe will\r\nrecover their independence with, I hope, better governments. But the\r\nEnglish government never dies, because their king is no part of it, he\r\nis a mere formality, and the real government is the aristocracy of the\r\ncountry, for their House of Commons is of that class. Their aim is to\r\nclaim the dominion of the ocean by conquest, and to make every vessel\r\nnavigating it pay a tribute to the support of the fleet necessary to\r\nmaintain that dominion, to which their own resources are inadequate.\r\nI see no means of terminating their maritime dominion and tyranny but\r\nin their own bankruptcy, which I hope is approaching. But I turn from\r\nthese painful contemplations to the more pleasing one of my constant\r\nfriendship and respect for you.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS TO THOMAS JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n                                                     QUINCY, July 15, 1813.\r\n\r\nNever mind it, my dear Sir, if I write four letters to your one, your\r\none is worth more than my four.\r\n\r\nIt is true that I can say, and have said, nothing new on the subject of\r\ngovernment. Yet I did say in my defence and in my discourses on Davila,\r\nthough in an uncouth style, what was new to Locke, to Harrington, to\r\nMilton, to Hume, to Montesquieu, to Rousseau, to Turgot, to Condorcet, to\r\nRochefaucault, to Price, to Franklin, and to yourself; and at that time\r\nto almost all Europe and America. I can prove all this by indisputable\r\nauthorities and documents.\r\n\r\nWritings on government had been not only neglected, but discountenanced\r\nand discouraged throughout all Europe, from the restoration of Charles\r\nthe Second in England, till the French revolution commenced.\r\n\r\nThe English commonwealth, the fate of Charles the 1st, and the military\r\ndespotism of Cromwell, had sickened mankind with disquisitions on\r\ngovernment to such a degree, that there was scarcely a man in Europe\r\nwho had looked into the subject.\r\n\r\nDavid Hume had made himself so fashionable with the aid of the court\r\nand clergy, Atheist, as they called him, and by his elegant lies against\r\nthe republicans and gaudy daubings of the courtiers, that he had nearly\r\nlaughed into contempt Rapin, Sydney, and even Locke. It was ridiculous\r\nand even criminal in almost all Europe to speak of constitutions, or\r\nwriters upon the principles or the fabrics of them.\r\n\r\nIn this state of things my poor, unprotected, unpatronized books appeared;\r\nand met with a fate not quite so cruel as I had anticipated. They were\r\nat last, however, overborne by misrepresentations, and will perish\r\nin obscurity, though they have been translated into German as well as\r\nFrench. The three emperors of Europe, the Prince Regents, and all the\r\nruling powers, would no more countenance or tolerate such writings, than\r\nthe Pope, the emperor of Haiti, Ben Austin, or Tom Paine.\r\n\r\nThe nations of Europe appeared to me, when I was among them, from the\r\nbeginning of 1778, to 1785, _i. e._ to the commencement of the troubles\r\nin France, to be advancing by slow but sure steps towards an amelioration\r\nof the condition of man in religion and government, in liberty, equality,\r\nfraternity, knowledge, civilization and humanity.\r\n\r\nThe French revolution I dreaded, because I was sure it would not only\r\narrest the progress of improvement, but give it a retrograde course, for\r\nat least a century, if not many centuries. The French patriots appeared\r\nto me like young scholars from a college, or sailors flushed with recent\r\npay or prize money, mounted on wild horses, lashing and spurring till\r\nthey would kill the horses, and break their own necks.\r\n\r\nLet me now ask you very seriously, my friend, where are now, in 1813,\r\nthe perfection and the perfectability of human nature? Where is now the\r\nprogress of the human mind? Where is the amelioration of society? Where\r\nthe augmentations of human comforts? Where the diminutions of human pains\r\nand miseries? I know not whether the last day of Dr. Young can exhibit\r\nto a mind unstaid by philosophy and religion [for I hold there can be\r\nno philosophy without religion], more terrors than the present state\r\nof the world. When, where, and how is the present chaos to be arranged\r\ninto order? There is not, there cannot be, a greater abuse of words\r\nthan to call the writings of Calender, Paine, Austin and Lowell, or the\r\nspeeches of Ned Livingston and John Randolph, public discussions. The\r\nravings and rantings of Bedlam merit the character as well; and yet Joel\r\nBarlow was about to record Tom Paine as the great author of the American\r\nRevolution! If he was, I desire that my name may be blotted out forever\r\nfrom its records.\r\n\r\nYou and I ought not to die before we have explained ourselves to each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nI shall come to the subject of religion by-and-bye. Your friend.\r\n\r\nI have been looking for some time for a space in my good husband's\r\nletters to add the regards of an old friend, which are still cherished\r\nand preserved through all the changes and vicissitudes which have taken\r\nplace since we first became acquainted, and will, I trust, remain as\r\nlong as\r\n\r\n                                                                  A. ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS TO THOMAS JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n                                                     QUINCY, July 16, 1813.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your letters to Priestley have increased my grief, if that were\r\npossible, for the loss of Rush. Had he lived, I would have stimulated\r\nhim to insist on your promise to him, to write him on the subject of\r\nreligion. Your plan I admire.\r\n\r\nIn your letter to Priestley of March 21st, 1801, dated at Washington,\r\nyou call \"The Christian Philosophy, the most sublime and benevolent, but\r\nthe most perverted system that ever shone upon man.\" That it is the most\r\nsublime and benevolent, I agree. But whether it has been more perverted\r\nthan that of Moses, of Confucius, of Zoroaster, of Sanchoniathan, of\r\nNuma, of Mahomet, of the Druids, of the Hindoos, &c., &c., I cannot\r\nas yet determine because I am not sufficiently acquainted with those\r\nsystems, or the history of their effects, to form a decisive opinion of\r\nthe result of the comparison.\r\n\r\nIn your letter dated Washington, April 9, 1803, you say, \"In consequence\r\nof some conversations with Dr. Rush, in the years 1798-99. 1 had promised\r\nsome day to write to him a letter, giving him my view of the Christian\r\nsystem. I have reflected often on it since, and even sketched the outline\r\nin my own mind. I should first take a general view of the moral doctrines\r\nof the most remarkable of the ancient philosophers, of whose ethics we\r\nhave sufficient information to make an estimate; say of Pythagoras,\r\nEpicurus, Epictetus, Socrates, Cicero, Seneca, Antonius. I should do\r\njustice to the branches of morality they have treated well, but point out\r\nthe importance of those in which they are deficient. I should then take\r\na view of the Deism and Ethics of the Jews, and show in what a degraded\r\nstate they were, and the necessity they presented of a reformation. I\r\nshould proceed to a view of the life, character, and doctrines of Jesus,\r\nwho, sensible of the incorrectness of their ideas of the Deity, and of\r\nmorality, endeavored to bring them to the principles of a pure Deism,\r\nand juster notions of the attributes of God--to reform their moral\r\ndoctrines to the standard of reason, justice, and philanthropy, and to\r\ninculcate the belief of a future state. This view would purposely omit\r\nthe question of his Divinity, and even of his inspiration. To do him\r\njustice, it would be necessary to remark the disadvantages his doctrines\r\nhave to encounter, not having been committed to writing by himself, but\r\nby the most unlettered of men, by memory, long after they had heard them\r\nfrom him, when much was forgotten, much misunderstood, and presented\r\nin very paradoxical shapes; yet such are the fragments remaining, as\r\nto show a master workman, and that his system of morality was the most\r\nbenevolent and sublime, probably, that has been ever taught, and more\r\nperfect than those of any of the ancient philosophers. His character and\r\ndoctrines have received still greater injury from those who pretend to\r\nbe his special disciples, and who have disfigured and sophisticated his\r\nactions and precepts from views of personal interest, so as to induce\r\nthe unthinking part of mankind to throw off the whole system in disgust,\r\nand to pass sentence, as an imposter, on the most innocent, the most\r\nbenevolent, the most eloquent and sublime character that has ever been\r\nexhibited to man. This is the outline!\"\r\n\r\n\"Sancte Socrate! ora pro nobis!\"--Erasmus.\r\n\r\nPriestley in his letter to Linsay, enclosing a copy of your letter to\r\nhim, says, \"He is generally considered an unbeliever; if so, however, he\r\ncannot be far from us, and I hope in the way to be not only almost, but\r\naltogether what we are. He now attends public worship very regularly,\r\nand his moral conduct was never impeached.\"\r\n\r\nNow, I see not but you are as good a Christian as Priestley and Linsay.\r\nPiety and morality were the end and object of the Christian system,\r\naccording to them, and according to you. They believed in the resurrection\r\nof Jesus, in his miracles, and in his inspiration; but what inspiration?\r\nNot all that is recorded in the New Testament, nor the Old. They have not\r\nyet told us how much they believe, or how much they doubt or disbelieve.\r\nThey have not told us how much allegory, how much parable, they find,\r\nnor how they explain them all, in the Old Testament or the New.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams has written for years to his two sons, boys of ten and\r\ntwelve, a series of letters, in which he pursues a plan more extensive\r\nthan yours; but agreeing in most of the essential points. I wish these\r\nletters could be preserved in the bosoms of his boys, but women and\r\npriests will get them; and I expect, if he makes a peace, he will be\r\nobliged to retire like a Jay, to study prophecies to the end of his\r\nlife. I have more to say on this subject of religion.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS TO THOMAS JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n                                                     QUINCY, July 18, 1813.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have more to say on religion. For more than sixty years\r\nI have been attentive to this great subject. Controversies between\r\nCalvinists and Armenians, Trinitarians and Unitarians, Deists and\r\nChristians, Atheists and both, have attracted my attention, whenever\r\nthe singular life I have led would admit, to all these questions. The\r\nhistory of this little village of Quincy, if it were worth recording,\r\nwould explain to you how this happened. I think I can now say I have\r\nread away bigotry, if not enthusiasm. What does Priestley mean by an\r\nunbeliever, when he applies it to you? How much did he \"unbelieve\"\r\nhimself? Gibbon had him right, when he determined his creed \"scanty.\"\r\nWe are to understand, no doubt, that he believed the resurrection of\r\nJesus; some of his miracles; his inspiration, but in what degree? He did\r\nnot believe in the inspiration of the writings that contain his history,\r\nyet he believed in the Apocalyptic beast, and he believed as much as he\r\npleased in the writings of Daniel and John. This great, excellent, and\r\nextraordinary man, whom I sincerely loved, esteemed, and respected, was\r\nreally a phenomenon; a comet in the system, like Voltaire, Bolingbroke,\r\nand Hume. Had Bolingbroke or Voltaire taken him in hand, what would they\r\nhave made of him and his creed.\r\n\r\nI do not believe you have read much of Priestley's \"corruptions of\r\nChristianity,\" his history of early opinions of Jesus Christ, his\r\npredestination, his no-soul system, or his controversy with Horsley.\r\n\r\nI have been a diligent student for many years in books whose titles\r\nyou have never seen. In Priestley's and Linsay's writings; in Farmer,\r\nin Cappe, in Tucker's or Edwards searches; Light of Nature pursued;\r\nin Edwards and Hopkins, and lately in Ezra Styles Ely; his reverend\r\nand learned panegyrists, and his elegant and spirited opponents. I am\r\nnot wholly uninformed of the controversies in Germany, and the learned\r\nresearches of universities and professors, in which the sanctity of\r\nthe Bible and the inspiration of its authors are taken for granted, or\r\nwaived, or admitted, or not denied. I have also read Condorcet's Progress\r\nof the Human Mind.\r\n\r\nNow, what is all this to you? No more, than if I should tell you that\r\nI read Dr. Clark, and Dr. Waterland, and Emlyn, and Leland's view or\r\nreview of the Deistical writers more than fifty years ago; which is a\r\nliteral truth. I blame you not for reading Euclid and Newton, Thucydides\r\nand Theocrites; for I believe you will find as much entertainment and\r\ninstruction in them, as I have found in my theological and ecclesiastical\r\ninstructors; or even as I have found in a profound investigation of the\r\nlife, writings, and doctrines of Erastus, whose disciples were Milton,\r\nHarrington, Selden, St. John, the Chief Justice, father of Bolingbroke,\r\nand others, the choicest spirits of their age; or in Le Harpe's history\r\nof the philosophy of the eighteenth century, or in Vander Kemp's vast\r\nmap of the causes of the revolutionary spirit in the same and preceding\r\ncenturies. These things are to me, at present, the marbles and nine-pins\r\nof old age; I will not say the beads and prayer-books.\r\n\r\nI agree with you, as far as you go, most cordially, and I think solidly.\r\nHow much farther I go, how much more I believe than you, I may explain\r\nin a future letter. Thus much I will say at present, I have found so\r\nmany difficulties, that I am not astonished at your stopping where you\r\nare; and so far from sentencing you to perdition, I hope soon to meet\r\nyou in another country.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS TO THOMAS JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n                                                     QUINCY, July 22, 1813.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Dr. Priestley, in a letter to Mr. Linsey, Northumberland,\r\nNovember 4, 1803, says:\r\n\r\n\"As you were pleased with my comparison of Socrates and Jesus, I have\r\nbegun to carry the same comparison to all the heathen moralists, and\r\nI have all the books that I want for the purpose except Simplicius\r\nand Arrian on Epictetus, and them I hope to get from a library in\r\nPhiladelphia; lest, however, I should fail there, I wish you or Mr.\r\nBelsham would procure and send them from London. While I am capable\r\nof anything I cannot be idle, and I do not know that I can do anything\r\nbetter. This, too, is an undertaking that Mr. Jefferson recommends to me.\"\r\n\r\nIn another letter, dated Northumberland, January 16th, 1804, Dr. Priestley\r\nsays to Mr. Linsey:\r\n\r\n\"I have now finished and transcribed for the press, my comparison of the\r\nGrecian philosophers with those of Revelation, and with more ease and\r\nmore to my own satisfaction than I expected They who liked my pamphlet\r\nentitled, 'Socrates and Jesus compared,' will not, I flatter myself,\r\ndislike this work. It has the same object and completes the scheme. It\r\nhas increased my own sense of the unspeakable value of revelation, and\r\nmust, I think, that of every person who will give due attention to the\r\nsubject.\"\r\n\r\nI have now given you all that relates to yourself in Priestley's letters.\r\n\r\nThis was possibly and not improbably, the last letter this great, this\r\nlearned, indefatigable, most excellent and extraordinary man ever wrote,\r\nfor on the 4th of February, 1804, he was released from his labors and\r\nsufferings. Peace, rest, joy and glory to his soul! For I believe he\r\nhad one, and one of the greatest.\r\n\r\nI regret, oh how I lament that he did not live to publish this work!\r\nIt must exist in manuscript. Cooper must know something of it. Can you\r\nlearn from him where it is, and get it printed?\r\n\r\nI hope you will still perform your promise to Doctor Rush.\r\n\r\nIf Priestley had lived, I should certainly have corresponded with him. His\r\nfriend Cooper, who, unfortunately for him and me and you, had as fatal\r\nan influence over him as Hamilton had over Washington, and whose rash\r\nhot head led Priestley into all his misfortunes and most of his errors\r\nin conduct, could not have prevented explanations between Priestley and\r\nme.\r\n\r\nI should propose to him a thousand, a million questions. And no man\r\nwas more capable or better disposed to answer them candidly than Dr.\r\nPriestley.\r\n\r\nScarcely anything that has happened to me in my curious life, has\r\nmade a deeper impression upon me than that such a learned, ingenious,\r\nscientific and talented madcap as Cooper, could have influence enough\r\nto make Priestley my enemy.\r\n\r\nI will not yet communicate to you more than a specimen of the questions\r\nI would have asked Priestley.\r\n\r\nOne is; Learned and scientific, Sir!--You have written largely about\r\nmatter and spirit, and have concluded there is no human soul. Will you\r\nplease to inform me what matter is? and what spirit is? Unless we know\r\nthe meaning of words, we cannot reason in or about words.\r\n\r\nI shall never send you all my questions that I would put to Priestley,\r\nbecause they are innumerable; but I may hereafter send you two or three.\r\n\r\nI am, in perfect charity, your old friend.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS TO THOMAS JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n                                                    QUINCY, August 9, 1813.\r\n\r\nI believe I told you in my last that I had given you all in Linsey's\r\nmemorial that interested you, but I was mistaken. In Priestley's letter\r\nto Linsey, December 19th, 1803, I find this paragraph:\r\n\r\n\"With the work I am now composing, I go on much faster and better than\r\nI expected, so that in two or three months, if my health continues as\r\nit now is, I hope to have it ready for the press, though I shall hardly\r\nproceed to print it till we have dispatched the notes.\r\n\r\n\"It is upon the same plan with that of Socrates and Jesus compared,\r\nconsidering all the more distinguished of the Grecian sects of philosophy,\r\ntill the establishment of Christianity in the Roman empire. If you liked\r\nthat pamphlet, I flatter myself you will like this.\r\n\r\n\"I hope it is calculated to show, in a peculiarly striking light, the\r\ngreat advantage of revelation, and that it will make an impression on\r\ncandid unbelievers if they will read.\r\n\r\n\"But I find few that will trouble themselves to read anything on the\r\nsubject, which, considering the great magnitude and interesting nature\r\nof the subject, is a proof of a very improper state of mind, unworthy\r\nof a rational being.\"\r\n\r\nI send you this extract for several reasons. First, because you set him\r\nupon this work. Secondly, because I wish you to endeavor to bring it to\r\nlight and get it printed. Thirdly, because I wish it may stimulate you\r\nto pursue your own plan which you promised to Dr. Rush.\r\n\r\nI have not seen any work which expressly compares the morality of the Old\r\nTestament with that of the New, in all their branches, nor either with\r\nthat of the ancient philosophers. Comparisons with the Chinese, the East\r\nIndians, the Africans, the West Indians, &c., would be more difficult;\r\nwith more ancient nations impossible. The documents are destroyed.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. ISAAC M'PHERSON.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, August 13, 1813.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your letter of August 3d asking information on the subject of Mr.\r\nOliver Evans' exclusive right to the use of what he calls his Elevators,\r\nConveyers, and Hopper-boys, has been duly received. My wish to see new\r\ninventions encouraged, and old ones brought again into useful notice,\r\nhas made me regret the circumstances which have followed the expiration\r\nof his first patent. I did not expect the retrospection which has been\r\ngiven to the reviving law. For although the second proviso seemed not\r\nso clear as it ought to have been, yet it appeared susceptible of a\r\njust construction; and the retrospective one being contrary to natural\r\nright, it was understood to be a rule of law that where the words of a\r\nstatute admit of two constructions, the one just and the other unjust,\r\nthe former is to be given them. The first proviso takes care of those\r\nwho had lawfully used Evans' improvements under the first patent; the\r\nsecond was meant for those who had lawfully erected and used them after\r\nthat patent expired, declaring they \"should not be liable to damages\r\ntherefor.\" These words may indeed be restrained to uses already past, but\r\nas there is parity of reason for those to come, there should be parity\r\nof law. Every man should be protected in his lawful acts, and be certain\r\nthat no _ex post facto_ law shall punish or endamage him for them. But\r\nhe is endamaged, if forbidden to use a machine lawfully erected, at\r\nconsiderable expense, unless he will pay a new and unexpected price for\r\nit. The proviso says that he who erected and used lawfully should not\r\nbe liable to pay damages. But if the proviso had been omitted, would not\r\nthe law, construed by natural equity, have said the same thing. In truth\r\nboth provisos are useless. And shall useless provisos, inserted _pro\r\nmajori cautela_ only, authorize inferences against justice? The sentiment\r\nthat _ex post facto_ laws are against natural right, is so strong in the\r\nUnited States, that few, if any, of the State constitutions have failed\r\nto proscribe them. The federal constitution indeed interdicts them in\r\ncriminal cases only; but they are equally unjust in civil as in criminal\r\ncases, and the omission of a caution which would have been right, does\r\nnot justify the doing what is wrong. Nor ought it to be presumed that\r\nthe legislature meant to use a phrase in an unjustifiable sense, if by\r\nrules of construction it can be ever strained to what is just. The law\r\nbooks abound with similar instances of the care the judges take of the\r\npublic integrity. Laws, moreover, abridging the natural right of the\r\ncitizen, should be restrained by rigorous constructions within their\r\nnarrowest limits.\r\n\r\nYour letter, however, points to a much broader question, whether what\r\nhave received from Mr. Evans the new and proper name of Elevators, are of\r\nhis invention. Because, if they are not, his patent gives him no right to\r\nobstruct others in the use of what they possessed before. I assume it is\r\na Lemma, that it is the invention of the machine itself, which is to give\r\na patent right, and not the application of it to any particular purpose,\r\nof which it is susceptible. If one person invents a knife convenient\r\nfor pointing our pens, another cannot have a patent right for the same\r\nknife to point our pencils. A compass was invented for navigating the\r\nsea; another could not have a patent right for using it to survey land.\r\nA machine for threshing _wheat_ has been invented in Scotland; a second\r\nperson cannot get a patent right for the same machine to thresh _oats_, a\r\nthird _rye_, a fourth _peas_, a fifth _clover_, &c. A string of buckets\r\nis invented and used for raising water, ore, &c., can a second have\r\na patent right to the same machine for raising wheat, a third oats, a\r\nfourth rye, a fifth peas, &c? The question then whether such a string of\r\nbuckets was invented first by Oliver Evans, is a mere question of fact\r\nin mathematical history. Now, turning to such books only as I happen to\r\npossess, I find abundant proof that this simple machinery has been in\r\nuse from time immemorial. Doctor Shaw, who visited Egypt and the Barbary\r\ncoast in the years 1727-8-9, in the margin of his map of Egypt, gives us\r\nthe figure of what he calls a Persian wheel, which is a string of round\r\ncups or buckets hanging on a pulley, over which they revolved, bringing\r\nup water from a well and delivering it into a trough above. He found this\r\nused at Cairo, in a well 264 feet deep, which the inhabitants believe to\r\nhave been the work of the patriarch Joseph. Shaw's travels, 341, Oxford\r\nedition of 1738 in folio, and the Universal History, I. 416, speaking\r\nof the manner of watering the higher lands in Egypt, says, \"formerly\r\nthey made use of Archimedes's screw, thence named the Egyptian pump, but\r\nthey now generally use wheels (wallowers) which carry a rope or chain\r\nof earthen pots holding about seven or eight quarts apiece, and draw the\r\nwater from the canals. There are besides a vast number of wells in Egypt,\r\nfrom which the water is drawn in the same manner to water the gardens\r\nand fruit trees; so that it is no exaggeration to say, that there are\r\nin Egypt above 200,000 oxen daily employed in this labor.\" Shaw's name\r\nof Persian wheel has been since given more particularly to a wheel with\r\nbuckets, either fixed or suspended on pins, at its periphery. Mortimer's\r\nhusbandry, I. 18, Duhamel III. II., Ferguson's Mechanic's plate, XIII;\r\nbut his figure, and the verbal description of the Universal History,\r\nprove that the string of buckets is meant under that name. His figure\r\ndiffers from Evans' construction in the circumstances of the buckets\r\nbeing round, and strung through their bottom on a chain. But it is the\r\nprinciple, to wit, a string of buckets, which constitutes the invention,\r\nnot the form of the buckets, round, square, or hexagon; nor the manner of\r\nattaching them, nor the material of the connecting band, whether chain,\r\nrope, or leather. Vitruvius, L. x. c. 9, describes this machinery as a\r\nwindlass, on which is a chain descending to the water, with vessels of\r\ncopper attached to it; the windlass being turned, the chain moving on\r\nit will raise the vessel, which in passing over the windlass will empty\r\nthe water they have brought up into a reservoir. And Perrault, in his\r\nedition of Vitruvius, Paris, 1684, fol. plates 61, 62, gives us three\r\nforms of these water elevators, in one of which the buckets are square,\r\nas Mr. Evans' are. Bossut, Histoire des Mathematiques, i. 86, says, \"the\r\ndrum wheel, the wheel with buckets and the _Chapelets_, are hydraulic\r\nmachines which come to us from the ancients. But we are ignorant of\r\nthe time when they began to be put into use.\" The _Chapelets_ are the\r\nrevolving bands of the buckets which Shaw calls the Persian wheel, the\r\nmoderns a chain-pump, and Mr. Evans elevators. The next of my books in\r\nwhich I find these elevators is Wolf's Cours de Mathematiques, i. 370,\r\nand plate 1, Paris 1747, 8vo; here are two forms. In one of them the\r\nbuckets are square, attached to two chains, passing over a cylinder or\r\nwallower at top, and under another at bottom, by which they are made to\r\nrevolve. It is a nearly exact representation of Evans' Elevators. But\r\na more exact one is to be seen in Desagulier's Experimental Philosophy,\r\nii. plate 34; in the Encyclopedie de Diderot et D'Alembert, 8vo edition\r\nof Lausanne, 1st volume of plates in the four subscribed Hydraulique.\r\nNorie, is one where round eastern pots are tied by their collars between\r\ntwo endless ropes suspended on a revolving lantern or wallower. This is\r\nsaid to have been used for raising ore out of a mine. In a book which\r\nI do not possess, L'Architecture Hydraulique de Belidor, the 2d volume\r\nof which is said [De la Lande's continuation of Montucla's Historie de\r\nMathematiques, iii. 711] to contain a detail of all the pumps, ancient\r\nand modern, hydraulic machines, fountains, wells, &c., I have no doubt\r\nthis Persian wheel, chain pump, chapelets, elevators, by whichever name\r\nyou choose to call it, will be found in various forms. The last book I\r\nhave to quote for it is Prony's Architecture Hydraulique i., Avertissement\r\nvii., and § 648, 649, 650. In the latter of which passages he observes\r\nthat the first idea which occurs for raising water is to lift it in a\r\nbucket by hand. When the water lies too deep to be reached by hand, the\r\nbucket is suspended by a chain and let down over a pulley or windlass.\r\nIf it be desired to raise a continued stream of water, the simplest\r\nmeans which offers itself to the mind is to attach to an endless chain\r\nor cord a number of pots or buckets, so disposed that, the chain being\r\nsuspended on a lanthorn or wallower above, and plunged in water below,\r\nthe buckets may descend and ascend alternately, filling themselves at\r\nbottom and emptying at a certain height above, so as to give a constant\r\nstream. Some years before the date of Mr. Evans' patent, a Mr. Martin of\r\nCaroline county in this State, constructed a drill-plough, in which he\r\nused the band of buckets for elevating the grain from the box into the\r\nfunnel, which let them down into the furrow. He had bands with different\r\nsets of buckets adapted to the size of peas, of turnip seed, &c. I have\r\nused this machine for sowing Benni seed also, and propose to have a\r\nband of buckets for drilling Indian Corn, and another for wheat. Is it\r\npossible that in doing this I shall infringe Mr. Evans' patent? That I\r\ncan be debarred of any use to which I might have applied my drill, when\r\nI bought it, by a patent issued after I bought it?\r\n\r\nThese verbal descriptions, applying so exactly to Mr. Evans' elevators,\r\nand the drawings exhibited to the eye, flash conviction both on reason\r\nand the senses that there is nothing new in these elevators but their\r\nbeing strung together on a strap of leather. If this strap of leather\r\nbe an invention, entitling the inventor to a patent right, it can only\r\nextend to the strap, and the use of the string of buckets must remain\r\nfree to be connected by chains, ropes, a strap of hempen girthing, or\r\nany other substance except leather. But, indeed, Mr. Martin had before\r\nused the strap of leather.\r\n\r\nThe screw of Archimedes is as ancient, at least, as the age of that\r\nmathematician, who died more than 2,000 years ago. Diodorus Siculus\r\nspeaks of it, L. i., p. 21, and L. v., p. 217, of Stevens' edition of\r\n1559, folio; and Vitruvius, xii. The cutting of its spiral worm into\r\nsections for conveying flour or grain, seems to have been an invention\r\nof Mr. Evans, and to be a fair subject of a patent right. But it cannot\r\ntake away from others the use of Archimedes' screw with its perpetual\r\nspiral, for any purposes of which it is susceptible.\r\n\r\nThe hopper-boy is an useful machine, and so far as I know, original.\r\n\r\nIt has been pretended by some, (and in England especially,) that inventors\r\nhave a natural and exclusive right to their inventions, and not merely\r\nfor their own lives, but inheritable to their heirs. But while it is\r\na moot question whether the origin of any kind of property is derived\r\nfrom nature at all, it would be singular to admit a natural and even an\r\nhereditary right to inventors. It is agreed by those who have seriously\r\nconsidered the subject, that no individual has, of natural right, a\r\nseparate property in an acre of land, for instance. By an universal law,\r\nindeed, whatever, whether fixed or movable, belongs to all men equally\r\nand in common, is the property for the moment of him who occupies it;\r\nbut when he relinquishes the occupation, the property goes with it.\r\nStable ownership is the gift of social law, and is given late in the\r\nprogress of society. It would be curious then, if an idea, the fugitive\r\nfermentation of an individual brain, could, of natural right, be claimed\r\nin exclusive and stable property. If nature has made any one thing less\r\nsusceptible than all others of exclusive property, it is the action of\r\nthe thinking power called an idea, which an individual may exclusively\r\npossess as long as he keeps it to himself; but the moment it is divulged,\r\nit forces itself into the possession of every one, and the receiver\r\ncannot dispossess himself of it. Its peculiar character, too, is that no\r\none possesses the less, because every other possesses the whole of it.\r\nHe who receives an idea from me, receives instruction himself without\r\nlessening mine; as he who lights his taper at mine, receives light without\r\ndarkening me. That ideas should freely spread from one to another over\r\nthe globe, for the moral and mutual instruction of man, and improvement\r\nof his condition, seems to have been peculiarly and benevolently designed\r\nby nature, when she made them, like fire, expansible over all space,\r\nwithout lessening their density in any point, and like the air in which\r\nwe breathe, move, and have our physical being, incapable of confinement\r\nor exclusive appropriation. Inventions then cannot, in nature, be a\r\nsubject of property. Society may give an exclusive right to the profits\r\narising from them, as an encouragement to men to pursue ideas which may\r\nproduce utility, but this may or may not be done, according to the will\r\nand convenience of the society, without claim or complaint from any body.\r\nAccordingly, it is a fact, as far as I am informed, that England was,\r\nuntil we copied her, the only country on earth which ever, by a general\r\nlaw, gave a legal right to the exclusive use of an idea. In some other\r\ncountries it is sometimes done, in a great case, and by a special and\r\npersonal act, but, generally speaking, other nations have thought that\r\nthese monopolies produce more embarrassment than advantage to society;\r\nand it may be observed that the nations which refuse monopolies of\r\ninvention, are as fruitful as England in new and useful devices.\r\n\r\nConsidering the exclusive right to invention as given not of natural\r\nright, but for the benefit of society, I know well the difficulty of\r\ndrawing a line between the things which are worth to the public the\r\nembarrassment of an exclusive patent, and those which are not. As a\r\nmember of the patent board for several years, while the law authorized a\r\nboard to grant or refuse patents, I saw with what slow progress a system\r\nof general rules could be matured. Some, however, were established by\r\nthat board. One of these was, that a machine of which we were possessed,\r\nmight be applied by every man to any use of which it is susceptible,\r\nand that this right ought not to be taken from him and given to a\r\nmonopolist, because the first perhaps had occasion so to apply it. Thus\r\na screw for crushing plaster might be employed for crushing corn-cobs.\r\nAnd a chain-pump for raising water might be used for raising wheat: this\r\nbeing merely a change of application. Another rule was that a change of\r\nmaterial should not give title to a patent. As the making a plough-share\r\nof cast rather than of wrought iron; a comb of iron instead of horn or\r\nof ivory, or the connecting buckets by a band of leather rather than of\r\nhemp or iron. A third was that a mere change of form should give no right\r\nto a patent, as a high-quartered shoe instead of a low one; a round hat\r\ninstead of a three-square; or a square bucket instead of a round one.\r\nBut for this rule, all the changes of fashion in dress would have been\r\nunder the tax of patentees. These were among the rules which the uniform\r\ndecisions of the board had already established, and under each of them\r\nMr. Evans' patent would have been refused. First, because it was a mere\r\nchange of application of the chain-pump from raising water to raise wheat.\r\nSecondly, because the using a leathern instead of a hempen band, was a\r\nmere change of material; and thirdly, square buckets instead of round, are\r\nonly a change of form, and the ancient forms, too, appear to have been\r\nindifferently square or round. But there were still abundance of cases\r\nwhich could not be brought under rule, until they should have presented\r\nthemselves under all their aspects; and these investigations occupying\r\nmore time of the members of the board than they could spare from higher\r\nduties, the whole was turned over to the judiciary, to be matured into\r\na system, under which every one might know when his actions were safe\r\nand lawful. Instead of refusing a patent in the first instance, as the\r\nboard was authorized to do, the patent now issues of course, subject\r\nto be declared void on such principles as should be established by the\r\ncourts of law. This business, however, is but little analogous to their\r\ncourse of reading, since we might in vain turn over all the lubberly\r\nvolumes of the law to find a single ray which would lighten the path of\r\nthe mechanic or the mathematician. It is more within the information of\r\na board of academical professors, and a previous refusal of patent would\r\nbetter guard our citizens against harassment by law-suits. But England\r\nhad given it to her judges, and the usual predominancy of her examples\r\ncarried it to ours.\r\n\r\nIt happened that I had myself a mill built in the interval between Mr.\r\nEvans' first and second patents. I was living in Washington, and left\r\nthe construction to the mill-wright. I did not even know he had erected\r\nelevators, conveyers and hopper-boys, until I learnt it by an application\r\nfrom Mr. Evans' agent for the patent price. Although I had no idea he\r\nhad a right to it by law, (for no judicial decision had then been given,)\r\nyet I did not hesitate to remit to Mr. Evans the old and moderate patent\r\nprice, which was what he then asked, from a wish to encourage even the\r\nuseful revival of ancient inventions. But I then expressed my opinion\r\nof the law in a letter, either to Mr. Evans or to his agent.\r\n\r\nI have thus, Sir, at your request, given you the facts and ideas which\r\noccur to me on this subject. I have done it without reserve, although\r\nI have not the pleasure of knowing you personally. In thus frankly\r\ncommitting myself to you, I trust you will feel it as a point of honor\r\nand candor, to make no use of my letter which might bring disquietude\r\non myself. And particularly, I should be unwilling to be brought into\r\nany difference with Mr. Evans, whom, however, I believe too reasonable\r\nto take offence at an honest difference of opinion. I esteem him much,\r\nand sincerely wish him wealth and honor. I deem him a valuable citizen,\r\nof uncommon ingenuity and usefulness. And had I not esteemed still more\r\nthe establishment of sound principles, I should now have been silent.\r\nIf any of the matter I have offered can promote that object, I have no\r\nobjection to its being so used; if it offers nothing new, it will of\r\ncourse not be used at all. I have gone with some minuteness into the\r\nmathematical history of the elevator, because it belongs to a branch\r\nof science in which, as I have before observed, it is not incumbent on\r\nlawyers to be learned; and it is possible, therefore, that some of the\r\nproofs I have quoted may have escaped on their former arguments. On the\r\nlaw of the subject I should not have touched, because more familiar to\r\nthose who have already discussed it; but I wished to state my own view\r\nof it merely in justification of myself, my name and approbation being\r\nsubscribed to the act. With these explanations, accept the assurance of\r\nmy respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN WALDO.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, August 16, 1813.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your favor of March 27th came during my absence on a journey of\r\nsome length. It covered your \"Rudiments of English Grammar,\" for which\r\nI pray you to accept my thanks. This acknowledgment of it has been\r\ndelayed, until I could have time to give the work such a perusal as the\r\navocations to which I am subject would permit. In the rare and short\r\nintervals which these have allotted me, I have gone over with pleasure\r\na considerable part, although not yet the whole of it. But I am entirely\r\nunqualified to give that critical opinion of it which you do me the favor\r\nto ask. Mine has been a life of business, of that kind which appeals to a\r\nman's conscience, as well as his industry, not to let it suffer, and the\r\nfew moments allowed me from labor have been devoted to more attractive\r\nstudies, that of grammar having never been a favorite with me. The scanty\r\nfoundation, laid in at school, has carried me though a life of much hasty\r\nwriting, more indebted for style to reading and memory, than to rules\r\nof grammar. I have been pleased to see that in all cases you appeal to\r\nusage, as the arbiter of language; and justly consider that as giving\r\nlaw to grammar, and not grammar to usage. I concur entirely with you\r\nin opposition to Purists, who would destroy all strength and beauty of\r\nstyle, by subjecting it to a rigorous compliance with their rules. Fill\r\nup all the ellipses and syllepses of Tacitus, Sallust, Livy, &c., and\r\nthe elegance and force of their sententious brevity are extinguished.\r\n\r\n\"Auferre, trucidare, rapere, falsis nominibus, imperium appellant.\"\r\n\"Deorum injurias, diis curæ.\" \"Allieni appetens, sui profusus; ardens in\r\ncupiditatibus; satis loquentiæ, sapientiæ parum.\" \"Annibal peto pacem.\"\r\n\"Per diem Sol non _uret_ te, neque Luna per noctem.\" Wire-draw these\r\nexpressions by filling up the whole syntax and sense, and they become dull\r\nparaphrases on rich sentiments. We may say then truly with Quinctilian,\r\n\"Aliud est Grammaticé, aliud Latiné loqui.\" I am no friend, therefore,\r\nto what is called _Purism_, but a zealous one to the _Neology_ which has\r\nintroduced these two words without the authority of any dictionary. I\r\nconsider the one as destroying the nerve and beauty of language, while\r\nthe other improves both, and adds to its copiousness. I have been not a\r\nlittle disappointed, and made suspicious of my own judgment, on seeing\r\nthe Edinburgh Reviews, the ablest critics of the age, set their faces\r\nagainst the introduction of new words into the English language; they\r\nare particularly apprehensive that the writers of the United States will\r\nadulterate it. Certainly so great growing a population, spread over such\r\nan extent of country, with such a variety of climates, of productions,\r\nof arts, must enlarge their language, to make it answer its purpose of\r\nexpressing all ideas, the new as well as the old. The new circumstances\r\nunder which we are placed, call for new words, new phrases, and for the\r\ntransfer of old words to new objects. An American dialect will therefore\r\nbe formed; so will a West-Indian and Asiatic, as a Scotch and an Irish\r\nare already formed. But whether will these adulterate, or enrich the\r\nEnglish language? Has the beautiful poetry of Burns, or his Scottish\r\ndialect, disfigured it? Did the Athenians consider the Doric, the Ionian,\r\nthe Æolic, and other dialects, as disfiguring or as beautifying their\r\nlanguage? Did they fastidiously disavow Herodotus, Pindar, Theocritus,\r\nSappho, Alcæus, or Grecian writers? On the contrary, they were sensible\r\nthat the variety of dialects, still infinitely varied by poetical license,\r\nconstituted the riches of their language, and made the Grecian Homer\r\nthe first of poets, as he must ever remain, until a language equally\r\nductile and copious shall again be spoken.\r\n\r\nEvery language has a set of terminations, which make a part of its\r\npeculiar idiom. Every root among the Greeks was permitted to vary its\r\ntermination, so as to express its radical idea in the form of any one of\r\nthe parts of speech; to wit, as a noun, an adjective, a verb, participle,\r\nor adverb; and each of these parts of speech again, by still varying\r\nthe termination, could vary the shade of idea existing in the mind.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was not, then, the number of Grecian roots (for some other languages\r\nmay have as many) which made it the most copious of the ancient languages;\r\nbut the infinite diversification which each of these admitted. Let\r\nthe same license be allowed in English, the roots of which, native and\r\nadopted, are perhaps more numerous, and its idiomatic terminations more\r\nvarious than of the Greek, and see what the language would become. Its\r\nidiomatic terminations are:--\r\n\r\n_Subst._ Gener-ation--ator; degener-acy;\r\ngener-osity--ousness--alship--alissimo; king-dom--ling; joy-ance;\r\nenjoy-er--ment; herb-age--alist; sanct-uary--imony--itude; royal-ism;\r\nlamb-kin; child-hood; bishop-ric; proceed-ure; horseman-ship; worthi-ness.\r\n\r\n_Adj._ Gener-ant--ative--ic--ical--able--ous--al; joy-ful--less--some;\r\nherb-y; accous-escent--ulent; child-ish; wheat-en.\r\n\r\n_Verb._ Gener-ate--alize.\r\n\r\n_Part._ Gener-ating--ated.\r\n\r\n_Adv._ Gener-al--ly.\r\n\r\nI do not pretend that this is a complete list of all the terminations of\r\nthe two languages. It is as much so as a hasty recollection suggests,\r\nand the omissions are as likely to be to the disadvantage of the one\r\nas the other. If it be a full, or equally fair enumeration, the English\r\nare the double of the Greek terminations.\r\n\r\nBut there is still another source of copiousness more abundant than\r\nthat of termination. It is the composition of the root, and of every\r\nmember of its family, 1, with prepositions, and 2, with other words.\r\nThe prepositions used in the composition of Greek words are:--\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNow multiply each termination of a family into every preposition, and\r\nhow prolific does it make each root! But the English language, besides\r\nits own prepositions, about twenty in number, which it compounds with\r\nEnglish roots, uses those of the Greek for adopted Greek roots, and\r\nof the Latin for Latin roots. The English prepositions, with examples\r\nof their use, are a, as in a-long, a-board, a-thirst, a-clock; be, as\r\nin be-lie; mis, as in mis-hap; these being inseparable. The separable,\r\nwith examples, are above-cited, after-thought, gain-say, before-hand,\r\nfore-thought, behind-hand, by-law, for-give, fro-ward, in-born, on-set,\r\nover-go, out-go, thorough-go, under-take, up-lift, with-stand. Now let\r\nus see what copiousness this would produce, were it allowed to compound\r\nevery root and its family with every preposition, where both sense and\r\nsound would be in its favor. Try it on an English root, the verb \"to\r\nplace,\" Anglo Saxon _plæce_,[4] for instance, and the Greek and Latin\r\nroots, of kindred meaning, adopted in English, to wit, θεσις and locatio,\r\nwith their prepositions.\r\n\r\n     mis-place\r\n     after-place\r\n     gain-place\r\n     fore-place\r\n     hind-place\r\n     by-place\r\n     for-place\r\n     fro-place\r\n     in-place\r\n     on-place\r\n     over-place\r\n     out-place\r\n     thorough-place\r\n     under-place\r\n     up-place\r\n     with-place\r\n     amphi-thesis\r\n     ana-thesis\r\n     anti-thesis\r\n     apo-thesis\r\n     dia-thesis\r\n     ek-thesis\r\n     en-thesis\r\n     epi-thesis\r\n     cata-thesis\r\n     para-thesis\r\n     peri-thesis\r\n     pro-thesis\r\n     pros-thesis\r\n     syn-thesis\r\n     hyper-thesis\r\n     hypo-thesis\r\n     a-location\r\n     ab-location\r\n     abs-location\r\n     al-location\r\n     anti-location\r\n     circum-location\r\n     cis-location\r\n     col-location\r\n     contra-location\r\n     de-location\r\n     di-location\r\n     dis-location\r\n     e-location\r\n     ex-location\r\n     extra-location\r\n     il-location\r\n     inter-location\r\n     intro-location\r\n     juxta-location\r\n     ob-location\r\n     per-location\r\n     post-location\r\n     pre-location\r\n     preter-location\r\n     pro-location\r\n     retro-location\r\n     re-location\r\n     se-location\r\n     sub-location\r\n     super-location\r\n     trans-location\r\n     ultra-location\r\n\r\nSome of these compounds would be new; but all present distinct meanings,\r\nand the synonisms of the three languages offer a choice of sounds to\r\nexpress the same meaning; add to this, that in some instances, usage has\r\nauthorized the compounding an English root with a Latin preposition,\r\nas in de-place, dis-place, re-place. This example may suffice to show\r\nwhat the language would become, in strength, beauty, variety, and every\r\ncircumstance which gives perfection to language, were it permitted freely\r\nto draw from all its legitimate sources.\r\n\r\nThe second source of composition is of one family of roots with another.\r\nThe Greek avails itself of this most abundantly, and beautifully. The\r\nEnglish once did it freely, while in its Anglo-Saxon form, _e. g._\r\n+boc-cræft+, book-craft, learning, +riht-geleaf-full+, right-belief-ful,\r\northodox. But it has lost by desuetude much of this branch of composition,\r\nwhich it is desirable however to resume.\r\n\r\nIf we wish to be assured from experiment of the effect of a judicious\r\nspirit of Neology, look at the French language. Even before the\r\nrevolution, it was deemed much more copious than the English; at a time,\r\ntoo, when they had an academy which endeavored to arrest the progress of\r\ntheir language, by fixing it to a Dictionary, out of which no word was\r\never to be sought, used, or tolerated. The institution of parliamentary\r\nassemblies in 1789, for which their language had no opposite terms or\r\nphrases, as having never before needed them, first obliged them to adopt\r\nthe Parliamentary vocabulary of England; and other new circumstances\r\ncalled for corresponding new words; until by the number of these adopted,\r\nand by the analogies for adoption which they have legitimated, I think\r\nwe may say with truth that a Dictionaire Neologique of these would be\r\nhalf as large as the dictionary of the academy; and that at this time\r\nit is the language in which every shade of idea, distinctly perceived\r\nby the mind, may be more exactly expressed, than in any language at\r\nthis day spoken by man. Yet I have no hesitation in saying that the\r\nEnglish language is founded on a broader base, native and adopted, and\r\ncapable, with the like freedom of employing its materials, of becoming\r\nsuperior to that in copiousness and euphony. Not indeed by holding fast\r\nto Johnson's Dictionary; not by raising a hue and cry against every word\r\nhe has not licensed; but by encouraging and welcoming new compositions\r\nof its elements. Learn from Lye and Benson what the language would now\r\nhave been if restrained to their vocabularies. Its enlargement must be\r\nthe consequence, to a certain degree, of its transplantation from the\r\nlatitude of London into every climate of the globe; and the greater the\r\ndegree the more precious will it become as the organ of the development\r\nof the human mind.\r\n\r\nThese are my visions on the improvement of the English language by a\r\nfree use of its faculties. To realize them would require a course of\r\ntime. The example of good writers, the approbation of men of letters,\r\nthe judgment of sound critics, and of none more than of the Edinburgh\r\nReviewers, would give it a beginning, and once begun, its progress might\r\nbe as rapid as it has been in France, where we see what a period of only\r\ntwenty years has effected. Under the auspices of British science and\r\nexample it might commence with hope. But the dread of innovation there,\r\nand especially of any example set by France, has, I fear, palsied the\r\nspirit of improvement. Here, where all is new, no innovation is feared\r\nwhich offers good. But we have no distinct class of literati in our\r\ncountry. Every man is engaged in some industrious pursuit, and science\r\nis but a secondary occupation, always subordinate to the main business\r\nof his life. Few therefore of those who are qualified, have leisure to\r\nwrite. In time it will be otherwise. In the meanwhile, necessity obliges\r\nus to neologize. And should the language of England continue stationary,\r\nwe shall probably enlarge our employment of it, until its new character\r\nmay separate it in name as well as in power, from the mother-tongue.\r\n\r\nAlthough the copiousness of a language may not in strictness make a part\r\nof its grammar, yet it cannot be deemed foreign to a general course of\r\nlectures on its structure and character; and the subject having been\r\npresented to my mind by the occasion of your letter, I have indulged\r\nmyself in its speculation, and hazarded to you what has occurred, with\r\nthe assurance of my great respect.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n    [4] Johnson derives \"place\" from the French \"place,\" an open\r\n    square in a town.

JOHN WILSON.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, August 17, 1813.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your letter of the 3d has been duly received. That of Mr. Eppes\r\nhad before come to hand, covering your MS. on the reformation of the\r\northography of the plural of nouns ending in _y_, and _ey_, and on\r\northoepy. A change has been long desired in English orthography, such as\r\nmight render it an easy and true index of the pronunciation of words.\r\nThe want of conformity between the combinations of letters, and the\r\nsounds they should represent, increases to foreigners the difficulty\r\nof acquiring the language, occasions great loss of time to children in\r\nlearning to read, and renders correct spelling rare but in those who\r\nread much. In England a variety of plans and propositions have been\r\nmade for the reformation of their orthography. Passing over these, two\r\nof our countrymen, Dr. Franklin and Dr. Thornton, have also engaged in\r\nthe enterprise; the former proposing an addition of two or three new\r\ncharacters only, the latter a reformation of the whole alphabet nearly.\r\nBut these attempts in England, as well as here, have been without effect.\r\nAbout the middle of the last century an attempt was made to banish the\r\nletter _d_ from the words bridge, judge, hedge, knowledge, &c., others\r\nof that termination, and to write them as we write age, cage, sacrilege,\r\nprivilege; but with little success. The attempt was also made, which you\r\nmention in your second part, to drop the letter _u_ in words of Latin\r\nderivation ending in _ou_r, and to write honor, candor, rigor, &c.,\r\ninstead of honour, candour, rigour. But the _u_ having been picked up in\r\nthe passage of these words from the Latin, through the French, to us, is\r\nstill preserved by those who consider it as a memorial of our title to\r\nthe words. Other partial attempts have been made by individual writers,\r\nbut with as little success. Pluralizing nouns in _y_, and _ey_, by adding\r\n_s_ only, as you propose, would certainly simplify the spelling, and\r\nbe analogous to the general idiom of the language. It would be a step\r\ngained in the progress of general reformation, if it could prevail.\r\nBut my opinion being requested I must give it candidly, that judging\r\nof the future by the past, I expect no better fortune to this than\r\nsimilar preceding propositions have experienced. It is very difficult\r\nto persuade the great body of mankind to give up what they have once\r\nlearned, and are now masters of, for something to be learnt anew. Time\r\nalone insensibly wears down old habits, and produces small changes at\r\nlong intervals, and to this process we must all accommodate ourselves,\r\nand be content to follow those who will not follow us. Our Anglo-Saxon\r\nancestors had twenty ways of spelling the word \"many.\" Ten centuries have\r\ndropped all of them and substituted that which we now use. I now return\r\nyour MS. without being able, with the gentlemen whose letters are cited,\r\nto encourage hope as to its effect. I am bound, however, to acknowledge\r\nthat this is a subject to which I have not paid much attention; and that\r\nmy doubts therefore should weigh nothing against their more favorable\r\nexpectations. That these may be fulfilled, and mine prove unfounded, I\r\nsincerely wish, because I am a friend to the reformation generally of\r\nwhatever can be made better, and because it could not fail of gratifying\r\nyou to be instrumental in this work. Accept the assurance of my respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, August 22, 1813.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Since my letter of June the 27th, I am in your debt for many;\r\nall of which I have read with infinite delight. They open a wide field\r\nfor reflection, and offer subjects enough to occupy the mind and the pen\r\nindefinitely. I must follow the good example you have set, and when I have\r\nnot time to take up every subject, take up a single one. Your approbation\r\nof my outline to Dr. Priestley is a great gratification to me; and I\r\nvery much suspect that if thinking men would have the courage to think\r\nfor themselves, and to speak what they think, it would be found they do\r\nnot differ in religious opinions as much as is supposed. I remember to\r\nhave heard Dr. Priestley say, that if all England would candidly examine\r\nthemselves, and confess, they would find that Unitarianism was really\r\nthe religion of all; and I observe a bill is now depending in parliament\r\nfor the relief of Anti-Trinitarians. It is too late in the day for men\r\nof sincerity to pretend they believe in the Platonic mysticisms that\r\nthree are one, and one is three; and yet that the one is not three,\r\nand the three are not one; to divide mankind by a single letter into\r\nομοουσιανς and ὁμοιουσιανς. But this constitutes the craft, the power\r\nand the profit of the priests. Sweep away their gossamer fabrics of\r\nfactitious religion, and they would catch no more flies. We should all\r\nthen, like the Quakers, live without an order of priests, moralize for\r\nourselves, follow the oracle of conscience, and say nothing about what\r\nno man can understand, nor therefore believe; for I suppose belief to\r\nbe the assent of the mind to an intelligible proposition.\r\n\r\nIt is with great pleasure I can inform you, that Priestley finished the\r\ncomparative view of the doctrines of the philosophers of antiquity,\r\nand of Jesus, before his death; and that it was printed soon after.\r\nAnd, with still greater pleasure, that I can have a copy of his work\r\nforwarded from Philadelphia, by a correspondent there, and presented for\r\nyour acceptance, by the same mail which carries you this, or very soon\r\nafter. The branch of the work which the title announces, is executed\r\nwith learning and candor, as was everything Priestley wrote, but perhaps\r\na little hastily; for he felt himself pressed by the hand of death.\r\nThe Abbé Batteux had, in fact laid the foundation of this part in his\r\nCauses Premieres, with which he has given us the originals of Ocellus\r\nand Timæus, who first committed the doctrines of Pythagoras to writing,\r\nand Enfield, to whom the Doctor refers, had done it more copiously. But\r\nhe has omitted the important branch, which, in your letter of August the\r\n9th, you say you have never seen executed, a comparison of the morality\r\nof the Old Testament with that of the New. And yet, no two things were\r\never more unlike. I ought not to have asked him to give it. He dared not.\r\nHe would have been eaten alive by his intolerant brethren, the Cannibal\r\npriests. And yet, this was really the most interesting branch of the work.\r\n\r\nVery soon after my letter to Doctor Priestley, the subject being still in\r\nmy mind, I had leisure during an abstraction from business for a day or\r\ntwo, while on the road, to think a little more on it, and to sketch more\r\nfully than I had done to him, a syllabus of the matter which I thought\r\nshould enter into the work. I wrote it to Doctor Rush, and there ended\r\nall my labor on the subject; himself and Doctor Priestley being the\r\nonly two depositories of my secret. The fate of my letter to Priestley,\r\nafter his death, was a warning to me on that of Doctor Rush; and at my\r\nrequest, his family were so kind as to quiet me by returning my original\r\nletter and syllabus. By this, you will be sensible how much interest I\r\ntake in keeping myself clear of religious disputes before the public,\r\nand especially of seeing my syllabus disembowelled by the Aruspices of\r\nthe modern Paganism. Yet I enclose it _to you_ with entire confidence,\r\nfree to be perused by yourself and Mrs. Adams, but by no one else, and\r\nto be returned to me.\r\n\r\nYou are right in supposing, in one of yours, that I had not read much\r\nof Priestley's Predestination, his no-soul system, or his controversy\r\nwith Horsley. But I have read his Corruptions of Christianity, and\r\nEarly Opinions of Jesus, over and over again; and I rest on them, and on\r\nMiddleton's writings, especially his letters from Rome, and to Waterland,\r\nas the basis of my own faith. These writings have never been answered,\r\nnor can be answered by quoting historical proofs, as they have done. For\r\nthese facts, therefore, I cling to their learning, so much superior to\r\nmy own.\r\n\r\nI now fly off in a tangent to another subject. Marshall, in the first\r\nvolume of his history, chapter 3, p. 180, ascribes the petition to the\r\nKing, of 1774, (1 Journ. Cong. 67) to the pen of Richard Henry Lee.\r\nI think myself certain it was not written by him, as well from what I\r\nrecollect to have heard, as from the internal evidence of style. His was\r\nloose, vague, frothy, rhetorical. He was a poorer writer than his brother\r\nArthur; and Arthur's standing may be seen in his Monitor's letters, to\r\ninsure the sale of which, they took the precaution of tacking to them\r\na new edition of the Farmer's letters, like Mezentius, who \"_mortua\r\njungebat corpora vivis_.\" You were of the committee, and can tell me\r\nwho wrote this petition, and who wrote the address to the inhabitants of\r\nthe colonies, ib. 45. Of the papers of July 1775, I recollect well that\r\nMr. Dickinson drew the petition to the King, ib. 149; I think Robert R.\r\nLivingston drew the address to the inhabitants of Great Britain, ib. 152.\r\nAm I right in this? And who drew the address to the people of Ireland,\r\nib. 180? On these questions I ask of your memory to help mine. Ever and\r\naffectionately yours.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. EPPES.\r\n\r\n                                         POPLAR FOREST, September 11, 1813.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I turn with great reluctance from the functions of a private\r\ncitizen to matters of State. The swaggering on deck, as a passenger,\r\nis so much more pleasant than clambering the ropes as a seaman, and my\r\nconfidence in the skill and activity of those employed to work the vessel\r\nis so entire, that I notice nothing _en passant_, but how smoothly she\r\nmoves. Yet I avail myself of the leisure which a visit to this place\r\nprocures me, to revolve again in my mind the subject of my former letter,\r\nand in compliance with the request of yours of ----, to add some further\r\nthoughts on it. Though intended as only supplementary to that, I may\r\nfall into repetitions, not having that with me, nor paper or book of\r\nany sort to supply the default of a memory on the wane.\r\n\r\nThe objects of finance in the United States have hitherto been very\r\nsimple; merely to provide for the support of the government on its peace\r\nestablishment, and to pay the debt contracted in the revolutionary war,\r\na war which will be sanctioned by the approbation of posterity through\r\nall future ages. The means provided for these objects were ample, and\r\nresting on a consumption which little affected the poor, may be said\r\nto have been sensibly felt by none. The fondest wish of my heart ever\r\nwas that the surplus portion of these taxes, destined for the payment\r\nof that debt, should, when that object was accomplished, be continued\r\nby annual or biennial re-enactments, and applied, in time of peace, to\r\nthe improvement of our country by canals, roads and useful institutions,\r\nliterary or others; and in time of war to the maintenance of the war. And\r\nI believe that keeping the civil list within proper bounds, the surplus\r\nwould have been sufficient for any war, administered with integrity and\r\njudgment. For authority to apply the surplus to objects of improvement,\r\nan amendment of the constitution would have been necessary. I have said\r\nthat the taxes should be continued by annual or biennial re-enactments,\r\nbecause a constant hold, by the nation, of the strings of the public\r\npurse, is a salutary restraint from which an honest government ought\r\nnot to wish, nor a corrupt one to be permitted to be free. No tax should\r\never be yielded for a longer term than that of the congress wanting it,\r\nexcept when pledged for the reimbursement of a loan. On this system,\r\nthe standing income being once liberated from the revolutionary debt,\r\nno future loan nor future tax would ever become necessary, and wars\r\nwould no otherwise affect our pecuniary interests than by suspending the\r\nimprovements belonging to a state of peace. This happy consummation would\r\nhave been achieved by another eight years' administration, conducted by\r\nMr. Madison, and executed in its financial department by Mr. Gallatin,\r\ncould peace have been so long preserved. So enviable a state in prospect\r\nfor our country, induced me to temporize, and to bear with national\r\nwrongs which under no other prospect ought ever to have been unresented\r\nor unresisted. My hope was, that by giving time for reflection, and\r\nretraction of injury, a sound calculation of their own interests would\r\ninduce the aggressing nations to redeem their own character by a return\r\nto the practice of right. But our lot happens to have been cast in\r\nan age when two nations to whom circumstances have given a temporary\r\nsuperiority over others, the one by land, the other by sea, throwing off\r\nall restraints of morality, all pride of national character, forgetting\r\nthe mutability of fortune and the inevitable doom which the laws of\r\nnature pronounce against departure from justice, individual or national,\r\nhave dared to treat her reclamations with derision, and to set up force\r\ninstead of reason as the umpire of nations. Degrading themselves thus\r\nfrom the character of lawful societies into lawless bands of robbers\r\nand pirates, they are abusing their brief ascendency by desolating the\r\nworld with blood and rapine. Against such a banditti, war had become\r\nless ruinous than peace, for then peace was a war on one side only. On\r\nthe final and formal declarations of England, therefore, that she never\r\nwould repeal her orders of council as to us, until those of France should\r\nbe repealed as to other nations as well as us, and that no practicable\r\narrangement against her impressment of our seamen could be proposed or\r\ndevised, war was justly declared, and ought to have been declared. This\r\nchange of condition has clouded our prospects of liberation from debt,\r\nand of being able to carry on a war without new loans or taxes. But\r\nalthough deferred, these prospects are not desperate. We should keep\r\nforever in view the state of 1817, towards which we were advancing, and\r\nconsider it as that which we must attain. Let the old funds continue\r\nappropriated to the civil list and revolutionary debt, and the reversion\r\nof the surplus to improvement during peace, and let us take up this war\r\nas a separate business, for which, substantive and distinct provision\r\nis to be made.\r\n\r\nThat we are bound to defray its expenses within our own time, and\r\nunauthorized to burthen posterity with them, I suppose to have been\r\nproved in my former letter. I will place the question nevertheless in\r\none additional point of view. The former regarded their independent\r\nright over the earth; this over their own persons. There have existed\r\nnations, and civilized and learned nations, who have thought that a\r\nfather had a right to sell his child as a slave, in perpetuity; that he\r\ncould alienate his body and industry conjointly, and _à fortiori_ his\r\nindustry separately; and consume its fruits himself. A nation asserting\r\nthis fratricide right might well suppose they could burthen with public\r\nas well as private debt their \"_nati natorum, et qui nascentur at\r\nillis_.\" But we, this age, and in this country especially, are advanced\r\nbeyond those notions of natural law. We acknowledge that our children\r\nare born free; that that freedom is the gift of nature, and not of him\r\nwho begot them; that though under our care during infancy, and therefore\r\nof necessity under a duly tempered authority, that care is confided to\r\nus to be exercised for the preservation and good of the child only; and\r\nhis labors during youth are given as a retribution for the charges of\r\ninfancy. As he was never the property of his father, so when adult he is\r\n_sui juris_, entitled himself to the use of his own limbs and the fruits\r\nof his own exertions: so far we are advanced, without mind enough, it\r\nseems, to take the whole step. We believe, or we act as if we believed,\r\nthat although an individual father cannot alienate the labor of his son,\r\nthe aggregate body of fathers may alienate the labor of all their sons,\r\nof their posterity, in the aggregate, and oblige them to pay for all\r\nthe enterprises, just or unjust, profitable or ruinous, into which our\r\nvices, our passions, or our personal interests may lead us. But I trust\r\nthat this proposition needs only to be looked at by an American to be\r\nseen in its true point of view, and that we shall all consider ourselves\r\nunauthorized to saddle posterity with our debts, and morally bound to pay\r\nthem ourselves; and consequently within what may be deemed the period of\r\na generation, or the life of the majority. In my former letter I supposed\r\nthis to be a little[5] over twenty years. We must raise then ourselves\r\nthe money for this war, either by taxes within the year, or by loans;\r\nand if by loans, we must repay them ourselves, proscribing forever the\r\nEnglish practice of perpetual funding; the ruinous consequences of which,\r\nputting right out of the question, should be a sufficient warning to a\r\nconsiderate nation to avoid the example.\r\n\r\nThe raising money by Tontine, more practised on the continent of Europe\r\nthan in England, is liable to the same objection, of encroachment on\r\nthe independent rights of posterity; because the annuities not expiring\r\ngradually, with the lives on which they rest, but all on the death of\r\nthe last survivor only, they will of course over-pass the term of a\r\ngeneration, and the more probably as the subjects on whose lives the\r\nannuities depend, are generally chosen of the ages, constitutions and\r\noccupations most favorable to long life.\r\n\r\nAnnuities for single lives are also beyond our powers, because the\r\nsingle life may pass the term of a generation. This last practice is\r\nobjectionable too, as encouraging celibacy, and the disinherison of heirs.\r\n\r\nOf the modes which are within the limits of right, that of raising within\r\nthe year its whole expenses by taxation, might be beyond the abilities\r\nof our citizens to bear. It, is moreover, generally desirable that the\r\npublic contributions should be as uniform as practicable from year to\r\nyear, that our habits of industry and of expense may become adapted to\r\nthem; and that they may be duly digested and incorporated with our annual\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\nThere remains then for us but the method of limited anticipation, the\r\nlaying taxes for a term of years within that of our right, which may\r\nbe sold for a present sum equal to the expenses of the year; in other\r\nwords, to obtain a loan equal to the expenses of the year, laying a tax\r\nadequate to its interest, and to such a surplus as will reimburse, by\r\ngrowing instalments, the whole principal within the term. This is, in\r\nfact, what has been called raising money on the sale of annuities for\r\nyears. In this way a new loan, and of course a new tax, is requisite\r\nevery year during the continuance of the war; and should that be so\r\nlong as to produce an accumulation of tax beyond our ability, in time\r\nof war the resource would be an enactment of the taxes requisite to\r\nensure good terms, by securing the lender, with a suspension of the\r\npayment of instalments of principal and perhaps of interest also, until\r\nthe restoration of peace. This method of anticipating our taxes, or of\r\nborrowing on annuities for years, insures repayment to the lender, guards\r\nthe rights of posterity, prevents a perpetual alienation of the public\r\ncontributions, and consequent destitution of every resource even for the\r\nordinary support of government. The public expenses of England during\r\nthe present reign, have amounted to the fee simple value of the whole\r\nisland. If its whole soil could be sold, farm by farm, for its present\r\nmarket price, it would not defray the cost of governing it during the\r\nreign of the present king, as managed by him. Ought not then the right\r\nof each successive generation to be guarantied against the dissipations\r\nand corruptions of those preceding, by a fundamental provision in our\r\nconstitution? And, if that has not been made, does it exist the less;\r\nthere being between generation and generation, as between nation and\r\nnation, no other law than that of nature? And is it the less dishonest to\r\ndo what is wrong, because not expressly prohibited by written law? Let us\r\nhope our moral principles are not yet in that stage of degeneracy, and\r\nthat in instituting the system of finance to be hereafter pursued, we\r\nshall adopt the only safe, the only lawful and honest one, of borrowing\r\non such short terms of reimbursement of interest and principal as will\r\nfall within the accomplishment of our own lives.\r\n\r\nThe question will be asked and ought to be looked at, what is to be\r\nthe resource if loans cannot be obtained? There is but one, \"_Carthago\r\ndelenda est_.\" Bank paper must be suppressed, and the circulating medium\r\nmust be restored to the nation to whom it belongs. It is the only fund\r\non which they can rely for loans; it is the only resource which can\r\nnever fail them, and it is an abundant one for every necessary purpose.\r\nTreasury bills, bottomed on taxes, bearing or not bearing interest, as\r\nmay be found necessary, thrown into circulation will take the place of\r\nso much gold and silver, which last, when crowded, will find an efflux\r\ninto other countries, and thus keep the quantum of medium at its salutary\r\nlevel. Let banks continue if they please, but let them discount for cash\r\nalone or for treasury notes. They discount for cash alone in every other\r\ncountry on earth except Great Britain, and her too often unfortunate\r\ncopyist, the United States. If taken in time they may be rectified by\r\ndegrees, and without injustice, but if let alone till the alternative\r\nforces itself on us, of submitting to the enemy for want of funds, or\r\nthe suppression of bank paper, either by law or by convulsion, we cannot\r\nforesee how it will end. The remaining questions are mathematical only.\r\nHow are the taxes and the time of their continuance to be proportioned\r\nto the sum borrowed, and the stipulated interest?\r\n\r\nThe rate of interest will depend on the state of the money market, and\r\nthe duration of the tax on the will of the legislature. Let us suppose\r\nthat (to keep the taxes as low as possible) they adopt the term of\r\ntwenty years for reimbursement, which we call their maximum; and let\r\nthe interest they last gave of 7½ per cent. be that which they must\r\nexpect to give. The problem then will stand in this form. Given the sum\r\nborrowed (which call _s_,) a million of dollars for example; the rate\r\nof interest .075 or 75/1000; (call it _r-i_) and the duration of the\r\nannuity or tax, twenty years, (=_t_,) what will be (_a_) the annuity or\r\ntax, which will reimburse principal and interest within the given term?\r\nThis problem, laborious and barely practicable to common arithmetic,\r\nis readily enough solved, Algebraically and with the aid of Logarithms.\r\nThe theorem applied to the case is _a_=(tr-1x1)/(1-1/n) the solution of\r\nwhich gives _a_=$98,684.2, nearly $100,000, or 1/10 of the sum borrowed.\r\n\r\nIt maybe satisfactory to see stated in figures the yearly progression\r\nof reimbursement of the million of dollars, and their interest at 7½\r\nper cent. effected by the regular payment of ---- dollars annually.

So that it is literally true\r\nthat the toleration of banks of paper-discount, costs the United States\r\none-half their war taxes; or, in other words, doubles the expenses of\r\nevery war. Now think, but for a moment, what a change of condition that\r\nwould be, which should save half our war expenses, require but half the\r\ntaxes, and enthral us in debt but half the time.\r\n\r\nTwo loans having been authorized, of sixteen and seven and a half\r\nmillions, they will require for their due reimbursement two millions\r\nthree hundred and fifty thousand dollars of the three millions expected\r\nfrom the taxes lately imposed. When the produce shall be known of the\r\nseveral items of these taxes, such of them as will make up this sum\r\nshould be selected, appropriated, and pledged for the reimbursement of\r\nthese loans. The balance of six hundred and fifty thousand dollars, will\r\nbe a provision for 6½ millions of the loan of the next year; and in all\r\nfuture loans, I would consider it as a rule never to be departed from,\r\nto lay a tax of 1/10, and pledge it for the reimbursement.\r\n\r\nIn the preceding calculations no account is taken of the increasing\r\npopulation of the United States, which we know to be in a compound\r\nratio of more than 3 per cent. per annum; nor of the increase of wealth,\r\nproved to be in a higher ratio by the increasing productiveness of the\r\nimports on consumption. We shall be safe therefore in considering every\r\ntax as growing at the rate of 3 per cent. compound ratio annually. I\r\nsay _every tax_, for as to those on consumption the fact is known; and\r\nthe same growth will be found in the value of real estate, if valued\r\nannually; or, which would be better, 3 per cent. might be assumed by the\r\nlaw as the average increase, and an addition of 1/33 of the tax paid the\r\npreceding year, be annually called for. Supposing then a tax laid which\r\nwould bring in $100,000 at the time it is laid, and that it increases\r\nannually at the rate of 3 per cent. compound, its important effect may\r\nbe seen in the following statement:\r\n\r\n     The 1st year 103,090, and reduces the million to $972,000\r\n         2d   \"   106,090,       \"      \"       \"      938,810\r\n         3d   \"   109,273,       \"      \"       \"      899,947\r\n         4th  \"   112,556,       \"      \"       \"      854,896\r\n         5th  \"   115,920,       \"      \"       \"      803,053\r\n         6th  \"   119,410,       \"      \"       \"      743,915\r\n         7th  \"   122,990,       \"      \"       \"      676,719\r\n         8th  \"   126,680,       \"      \"       \"      600,793\r\n                  ---------\r\n                  915,913\r\n\r\n     It yields the 9th year $130,470, and reduces it to $515,382\r\n                  10th  \"    134,390,     \"       \"      419,646\r\n                  11th  \"    138,420,     \"       \"      312,699\r\n                  12th  \"    142,580,     \"       \"      193,517\r\n                  13th  \"    146,850,     \"       \"       61,181\r\n                  14th  \"    151,260 over pays,           85,491\r\n                           ----------\r\n                           1,759,883\r\n\r\nThis estimate supposes a million borrowed at 7½ per cent; but, if obtained\r\nfrom the circulation without interest, it would be reimbursed within\r\neight years and eight months, instead of fourteen years, or of twenty\r\nyears, on our first estimate.\r\n\r\nBut this view being in prospect only, should not affect the quantum of\r\ntax which the former circulation pronounces necessary. Our creditors\r\nhave a right to certainty, and to consider these political speculations\r\nas make-weights only to that, and at our risk, not theirs. To us belongs\r\nonly the comfort of hoping an earlier liberation than that calculation\r\nholds out, and the right of providing expressly that the tax hypothecated\r\nshall cease so soon as the debt it secures shall be actually reimbursed;\r\nand I will add that to us belongs also the regret that improvident\r\nlegislators should have exposed us to a twenty years' thraldom of debts\r\nand taxes, for the necessary defence of our country, where the same\r\ncontributions would have liberated us in eight or nine years; or have\r\nreduced us perhaps to an abandonment of our rights, by their abandonment\r\nof the only resource which could have ensured their maintenance.\r\n\r\nI omit many considerations of detail because they will occur to yourself,\r\nand my letter is too long already. I can refer you to no book as treating\r\nof this subject fully and suitably to our circumstances. Smith gives the\r\nhistory of the public debt of England, and some views adapted to that;\r\nand Dr. Price, in his book on annuities, has given a valuable chapter\r\non the effects of a sinking fund. But our business being to make every\r\nloan tax a sinking fund for itself, no general one will be wanting; and\r\nif my confidence is well founded that our original import, when freed\r\nfrom the revolutionary debt, will suffice to embellish and improve our\r\ncountry in peace, and defend her in war, the present may be the only\r\noccasion of perplexing ourselves with sinking funds.\r\n\r\nShould the injunctions under which I laid you, as to my former letter,\r\nrestrain any useful purpose to which you could apply it, I remove them;\r\npreferring public benefit to all personal considerations. My original\r\ndisapprobation of banks circulating paper is not unknown, nor have\r\nI since observed any effects either on the morals or fortunes of our\r\ncitizens, which are any counterbalance for the public evils produced;\r\nand a thorough conviction that, if this war continues, that circulation\r\nmust be suppressed, or the government shaken to its foundation by the\r\nweight of taxes, and impracticability to raise funds on them, renders\r\nduty to that paramount to the love of ease and quiet.\r\n\r\nWhen I was here in May last, I left it without knowing that Francis was\r\nat school in this neighborhood. As soon as I returned, on the present\r\noccasion, I sent for him, but his tutor informed me that he was gone on\r\na visit to you. I shall hope permission for him always to see me on my\r\nvisits to this place, which are three or four times a year.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n    [5] [A lapse of memory, not having the letter to recur to.]\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS TO THOMAS JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n                                                QUINCY, September 14, 1813.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I owe you a thousand thanks for your favor of August 22d and\r\nits enclosures, and for Dr. Priestley's doctrines of Heathen Philosophy\r\ncompared with those of Revelation. Your letter to Dr. Rush and the\r\nsyllabus, I return enclosed with this according to your injunctions,\r\nthough with great reluctance. May I beg a copy of both?\r\n\r\nThey will do you no harm; me and others much good.\r\n\r\nI hope you will pursue your plan, for I am confident you will produce\r\na work much more valuable than Priestley's, though that is curious, and\r\nconsidering the expiring powers with which it was written, admirable.\r\n\r\nThe bill in Parliament for the relief of Anti-Trinitarians, is a great\r\nevent, and will form an epoch in ecclesiastical history. The motion was\r\nmade by my friend Smith, of Clapham, a friend of the Belshams.\r\n\r\nI should be very happy to hear that the bill is passed.\r\n\r\nThe human understanding is a revelation from its Maker which can never\r\nbe disputed or doubted. There can be no scepticism, Pyrrhonism, or\r\nincredulity, or infidelity, here. No prophecies, no miracles are necessary\r\nto prove the celestial communication.\r\n\r\nThis revelation has made it certain that two and one make three, and\r\nthat one is not three nor can three be one. We can never be so certain\r\nof any prophecy, or the fulfilment of any prophecy, or of any miracle,\r\nor the design of any miracle, as we are from the revelation of nature,\r\n_i. e._, Nature's God, that two and two are equal to four. Miracles or\r\nprophecies might frighten us out of our wits; might scare us to death;\r\nmight induce us to lie, to say that we believe that two and two make\r\nfive. But we should not believe it. We should know the contrary.\r\n\r\nHad you and I been forty days with Moses on Mount Sinai, and been admitted\r\nto behold the divine Shekinah, and there told that one was three and\r\nthree one, we might not have had courage to deny it, but we could not\r\nhave believed it.\r\n\r\nThe thunders, and lightnings, and earthquakes, and the transcendent\r\nsplendors and glories might have overwhelmed us with terror and amazement,\r\nbut we could not have believed the doctrine. We should be more likely to\r\nsay in our hearts whatever we might say with our lips,--This is chance.\r\nThere is no God, no truth. This is all delusion, fiction, and a lie, or\r\nit is all chance. But what is chance? It is motion, it is action, it is\r\nevent, it is phenomenon without cause.\r\n\r\nChance is no cause at all, it is nothing. And nothing has produced all\r\nthis pomp and splendor. And nothing may produce our eternal damnation\r\nin the flames of hell-fire and brimstone, for what we know, as well as\r\nthis tremendous exhibition of terror and falsehood.\r\n\r\nGod has infinite wisdom, goodness and power. He created the universe.\r\nHis duration is eternal, a parte ante and a parte post.\r\n\r\nHis presence is as extensive as space. What is space? An infinite\r\nspherical vacuum. He created this speck of dirt and the human species\r\nfor his glory, and with the deliberate design of making nine-tenths of\r\nour species miserable forever, for his glory.\r\n\r\nThis is the doctrine of Christian Theologians in general, ten to one.\r\n\r\nNow, my friend, can prophecies or miracles convince you or me, that\r\ninfinite benevolence, wisdom and power, created and preserves for a time,\r\ninnumerable millions, to make them miserable forever for his own glory?\r\n\r\nWretch! what is his glory? Is he ambitious? Does he want promotion? Is\r\nhe vain-tickled with adulation? Exulting and triumphing in his power\r\nand the sweetness of his vengeance?\r\n\r\nPardon me, my Maker, for these awful questions. My answer to them is\r\nalways ready. I believe no such things. My adoration of the Author of\r\nthe Universe is too profound and too sincere.\r\n\r\nThe love of God and his creation, delight, joy, triumph, exultation in my\r\nown existence, though but an atom, a molecule organique in the universe,\r\nare my religion. Howl, snarl, bite, ye Calvinistic, ye Athanasian divines,\r\nif you will. Ye will say I am no Christian. I say ye are no Christians,\r\nand there the account is balanced.\r\n\r\nYet I believe all the honest men among you are Christians, in my sense\r\nof the word.\r\n\r\nWhen I was at college, I was a metaphysician, at least I thought myself\r\nsuch. And such men as Lock, Hemenway and West, thought me so too; for\r\nwe were forever disputing though in great good humor.\r\n\r\nWhen I was sworn as an Attorney, in 1758, in Boston, though I lived in\r\nBraintree, I was in a low state of health--thought in great danger of a\r\nconsumption; living on milk, vegetable pudding and water. Not an atom of\r\nmeat, or a drop of spirit. My next neighbor, my cousin, my friend Dr.\r\nSavil, was my physician. He was anxious about me, and did not like to\r\ntake the sole responsibility of my recovery. He invited me to a ride.\r\nI mounted my horse and rode with him to Hingham, on a visit to Dr.\r\nEzekiel Hersey, a physician of great fame, who felt my pulse, looked in\r\nmy eyes, heard Savil describe my regimen and course of medicine, and\r\nthen pronounced his oracle: \"Persevere, and as sure as there is a God\r\nin Heaven you will recover.\"\r\n\r\nHe was an everlasting talker, and ran out into history, philosophy,\r\nmetaphysics, &c., and frequently put questions to me as if he wanted to\r\nsound me, and see if there was anything in me besides hectic fever. I\r\nwas young, and then very bashful, however saucy I may have sometimes been\r\nsince. I gave him very modest and very diffident answers. But when I got\r\nupon metaphysics, I seemed to feel a little bolder, and ventured into\r\nsomething like argument with him. I drove him up, as I thought, into a\r\ncorner, from which he could not escape. \"Sir, it will follow from what\r\nyou have now advanced, that the universe, as distinct from God, is both\r\ninfinite and eternal.\" \"Very true,\" said Dr. Hersey, \"your inference is\r\njust, the consequence is inevitable, and I believe the universe to be\r\nboth eternal and infinite.\"\r\n\r\nHere I was brought up! I was defeated. I was not prepared for this\r\nanswer. This was fifty-five years ago.\r\n\r\nWhen I was in England, from 1785 to 1788, I may say I was intimate with\r\nDr. Price. I had much conversation with him at his own house, at my\r\nhouse, and at the houses and tables of my friends. In some of our most\r\nunreserved conversations, when we have been alone, he has repeatedly\r\nsaid to me: \"I am inclined to believe that the universe is eternal\r\nand infinite. It seems to me that an eternal and infinite effect must\r\nnecessarily flow from an eternal and infinite cause; and an infinite\r\nwisdom, goodness and power, that could have been induced to produce a\r\nuniverse in time, must have produced it from eternity. It seems to me\r\nthe effect must flow from the cause.\"\r\n\r\nNow, my friend Jefferson, suppose an eternal, self-existent being,\r\nexisting from eternity, possessed of infinite wisdom, goodness and\r\npower, in absolute, total solitude, six thousand years ago, conceiving\r\nthe benevolent project of creating a universe! I have no more to say at\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nIt has been long, very long, a settled opinion in my mind, that there\r\nis now, never will be, and never was but one being who can understand\r\nthe universe.\r\n\r\nAnd that it is not only vain, but wicked, for insects to pretend to\r\ncomprehend it.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS TO THOMAS JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n                                                QUINCY, September 15, 1813.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--My last sheet would not admit an observation that was material\r\nto my design.\r\n\r\nDr. Price was inclined to think that infinite wisdom and goodness could\r\nnot permit infinite power to be inactive from eternity, but that an\r\ninfinite and eternal universe must have necessarily flowed from these\r\nattributes.\r\n\r\nPlato's system was \"αγαθος\" was eternal, self-existent, &c. His ideas,\r\nhis word, his reason, his wisdom, his goodness, or in one word his \"Logos\"\r\nwas omnipotent, and produced the universe from all eternity. Now! as far\r\nas you and I can understand Hersey, Price and Plato, are they not of one\r\ntheory? Of one mind? What is the difference? I own an eternal solitude\r\nof a self-existent being, infinitely wise, powerful and good, is to me\r\naltogether incomprehensible and incredible. I could as soon believe the\r\nAthanasian creed.\r\n\r\nYou will ask me what conclusion I draw from all this? I answer, I drop\r\ninto myself, and acknowledge myself to be a fool. No mind but one can see\r\nthrough the immeasurable system. It would be presumption and impiety in\r\nme to dogmatize on such subjects. My duties in my little infinitessimal\r\ncircle I can understand and feel. The duties of a son, a brother, a\r\nfather, a neighbor, a citizen, I can see and feel, but I trust the Ruler\r\nwith his skies.\r\n\r\n     Si quid novisti rectius, istis\r\n     Candidus imperti, si non, his utere, mecum.\r\n\r\nThis world is a mixture of the sublime and the beautiful, the base and\r\nthe contemptible, the whimsical and ridiculous, (according to our narrow\r\nsense and trifling feelings.) It is an enigma and a riddle. You need\r\nnot be surprised, then, if I should descend from these heights to the\r\nmost egregious trifle. But first let me say, I asked you in a former\r\nletter how far advanced we were in the science of aristocracy since\r\nTheognis' Stallions, Jacks and Rams? Have not Chancellor Livingston and\r\nMajor General Humphreys introduced an hereditary aristocracy of Merino\r\nSheep? How shall we get rid of this aristocracy? It is entailed upon us\r\nforever. And an aristocracy of land jobbers and stock jobbers is equally\r\nand irremediably entailed upon us, to endless generations.\r\n\r\nNow for the odd, the whimsical, the frivolous. I had scarcely sealed my\r\nlast letter to you upon Theognis' doctrine of well-born Stallions, Jacks\r\nand Rams, when they brought me from the Post Office a packet, without\r\npost mark, without letter, without name, date or place. Nicely sealed\r\nwas a printed copy of eighty or ninety pages, and in large full octavo,\r\nentitled: Section first--Aristocracy. I gravely composed my risible\r\nmuscles and read it through. It is from beginning to end an attack upon me\r\nby name for the doctrines of aristocracy in my three volumes of Defence,\r\n&c. The conclusion of the whole is that an aristocracy of bank paper\r\nis as bad as the nobility of France or England. I most assuredly will\r\nnot controvert this point with this man. Who he is I cannot conjecture.\r\nThe honorable John Taylor of Virginia, of all men living or dead, first\r\noccurred to me.\r\n\r\nIs it Oberon? Is it Queen Mab, that reigns and sports with us little\r\nbeings? I thought my books as well as myself were forgotten. But behold!\r\nI am to become a great man in my expiring moments. Theognis and Plato,\r\nand Hersey and Price, and Jefferson and I, must go down to posterity\r\ntogether; and I know not, upon the whole, where to wish for better\r\ncompany. I wish to add Vanderkemp, who has been here to see me, after an\r\ninterruption of twenty-four years. I could and ought to add many others,\r\nbut the catalogue would be too long. I am, as ever.\r\n\r\nP. S. Why is Plato associated with Theognis, &c.? Because no man ever\r\nexpressed so much terror of the power of birth. His genius could invent\r\nno remedy or precaution against it, but a community of wives; a confusion\r\nof families; a total extinction of all relations of father, son and\r\nbrother. Did the French Revolutionists contrive much better against the\r\ninfluence of birth?\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. WM. CANBY.\r\n\r\n                                            MONTICELLO, September 18, 1813.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have duly received your favor of August 27th, am sensible of the\r\nkind intentions from which it flows, and truly thankful for them. The\r\nmore so as they could only be the result of a favorable estimate of my\r\npublic course. During a long life, as much devoted to study as a faithful\r\ntransaction of the trusts committed to me would permit, no subject has\r\noccupied more of my consideration than our relations with all the beings\r\naround us, our duties to them, and our future prospects. After reading\r\nand hearing everything which probably can be suggested respecting them,\r\nI have formed the best judgment I could as to the course they prescribe,\r\nand in the due observance of that course, I have no recollections which\r\ngive me uneasiness. An eloquent preacher of your religious society,\r\nRichard Motte, in a discourse of much emotion and pathos, is said to\r\nhave exclaimed aloud to his congregation, that he did not believe there\r\nwas a Quaker, Presbyterian, Methodist or Baptist in heaven, having\r\npaused to give his hearers time to stare and to wonder. He added, that\r\nin heaven, God knew no distinctions, but considered all good men as his\r\nchildren, and as brethren of the same family. I believe, with the Quaker\r\npreacher, that he who steadily observes those moral precepts in which\r\nall religions concur, will never be questioned at the gates of heaven,\r\nas to the dogmas in which they all differ. That on entering there, all\r\nthese are left behind us, and the Aristides and Catos, the Penns and\r\nTillotsons, Presbyterians and Baptists, will find themselves united\r\nin all principles which are in concert with the reason of the supreme\r\nmind. Of all the systems of morality, ancient or modern, which have\r\ncome under my observation, none appear to me so pure as that of Jesus.\r\nHe who follows this steadily need not, I think, be uneasy, although he\r\ncannot comprehend the subtleties and mysteries erected on his doctrines\r\nby those who, calling themselves his special followers and favorites,\r\nwould make him come into the world to lay snares for all understandings\r\nbut theirs. These metaphysical heads, usurping the judgment seat of God,\r\ndenounce as his enemies all who cannot perceive the Geometrical logic\r\nof Euclid in the demonstrations of St. Athanasius, that three are one,\r\nand one is three; and yet that the one is not three nor the three one.\r\nIn all essential points you and I are of the same religion; and I am too\r\nold to go into inquiries and changes as to the unessential. Repeating,\r\ntherefore, my thankfulness for the kind concern you have been so good\r\nas to express, I salute you with friendship and brotherly esteem.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL DUANE.\r\n\r\n                                            MONTICELLO, September 18, 1813.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Repeated inquiries on the part of Senator Tracy what has\r\nbecome of his book, (the MS. I last sent you,) oblige me to ask of you\r\nwhat I shall say to him. I congratulate you on the brilliant affair of\r\nthe Enterprise and Boxer. No heart is more rejoiced than mine at these\r\nmortifications of English pride, and lessons to Europe that the English\r\nare not invincible at sea. And if these successes do not lead us too far\r\ninto the navy mania, all will be well. But when are to cease the severe\r\nlessons we receive by land, demonstrating our want of competent officers?\r\nThe numbers of our countrymen betrayed into the hands of the enemy by the\r\ntreachery, cowardice or incompetence of our high officers, reduce us to\r\nthe humiliating necessity of acquiescing in the brutal conduct observed\r\ntowards them. When, during the last war, I put Governor Hamilton and\r\nMajor Hay into a dungeon and in irons for having themselves personally\r\ndone the same to the American prisoners who had fallen into their hands,\r\nand was threatened with retaliation by Philips, then returned to New\r\nYork, I declared to him I would load ten of their Saratoga prisoners\r\n(then under my care and within half a dozen miles of my house) with\r\ndouble irons for every American they should misuse under pretence of\r\nretaliation, and it put an end to the practice. But the ten for one are\r\nnow with them. Our present hopes of being able to do something by land\r\nseem to rest on Chauncey. Strange reverse of expectations that our land\r\nforce should be under the wing of our little navy. Accept the assurance\r\nof my esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. ISAAC M'PHERSON.\r\n\r\n                                            MONTICELLO, September 18, 1813.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I thank you for the communication of Mr. Jonathan Ellicot's letter\r\nin yours of August 28th, and the information it conveys. With respect\r\nto mine of August 13th, I do not know that it contains anything but\r\nwhat any man of mathematical reading may learn from the same sources;\r\nhowever, if it can be used for the promotion of right, I consent to\r\nsuch an use of it. Your inquiry as to the date of Martin's invention\r\nof the drill plough, with a leathern band and metal buckets, I cannot\r\nprecisely answer; but I received one from him in 1794, and have used it\r\never since for sowing various seeds, chiefly peas, turnips, and benni. I\r\nhave always had in mind to use it for wheat; but sowing only a row at a\r\ntime, I had proposed to him some years ago to change the construction so\r\nthat it should sow four rows at a time, twelve inches apart; and I have\r\nbeen waiting for this to be done either by him or myself; and have not,\r\ntherefore, commenced that use of it. I procured mine at first through\r\nCol. John Taylor of Caroline, who had been long in the use of it, and\r\nmy impression was that it was not then a novel thing. Mr. Martin is\r\nstill living, I believe. If not, Colonel Taylor, his neighbor, probably\r\nknows its date. If the bringing together under the same roof various\r\nuseful things before known, which you mention as one of the grounds of\r\nMr. Evans' claim, entitles him to an exclusive use of all these, either\r\nseparately or combined, every utensil of life might be taken from us by\r\na patent. I might build a stable, bring into it a cutting-knife to chop\r\nstraw, a hand-mill to grind the grain, a curry comb and brush to clean\r\nthe horses, and by a patent exclude every one from ever more using these\r\nthings without paying me. The elevator, the conveyer, the hopper-boy,\r\nare distinct things, unconnected but by juxtaposition. If no patent\r\ncan be claimed for any one of these separately, it cannot be for all\r\nof them,--several nothings put together cannot make a something;--this\r\nwould be going very wide of the object of the patent laws. I salute you\r\nwith esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. JAMES MARTIN.\r\n\r\n                                            MONTICELLO, September 20, 1813.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your letter of August 20th, enabled me to turn to mine of February\r\n23d, 1798, and your former one of February 22d, 1801, and to recall\r\nto my memory the oration at Jamaica, which was the subject of them.\r\nI see with pleasure a continuance of the same sound principles in the\r\naddress to Mr. Quincy. Your quotation from the former paper alludes, as\r\nI presume, to the term of office to our Senate; a term, like that of the\r\njudges, too long for my approbation. I am for responsibilities at short\r\nperiods, seeing neither reason nor safety in making public functionaries\r\nindependent of the nation for life, or even for long terms of years.\r\nOn this principle I prefer the Presidential term of four years, to that\r\nof seven years, which I myself had at first suggested, annexing to it,\r\nhowever, ineligibility forever after; and I wish it were now annexed to\r\nthe 2d quadrennial election of President.\r\n\r\nThe conduct of Massachusetts, which is the subject of your address to\r\nMr. Quincy, is serious, as embarrassing the operations of the war, and\r\njeopardizing its issue; and still more so, as an example of contumacy\r\nagainst the Constitution. One method of proving their purpose, would\r\nbe to call a convention of their State, and to require them to declare\r\nthemselves members of the Union, and obedient to its determinations, or\r\nnot members, and let them go. Put this question solemnly to their people,\r\nand their answer cannot be doubtful. One half of them are republicans,\r\nand would cling to the Union from principle. Of the other half, the\r\ndispassionate part would consider, 1st. That they do not raise bread\r\nsufficient for their own subsistence, and must look to Europe for the\r\ndeficiency, if excluded from our ports, which vital interests would force\r\nus to do. 2d. That they are navigating people without a stick of timber\r\nfor the hull of a ship, nor a pound of anything to export in it, which\r\nwould be admitted at any market. 3d. That they are also a manufacturing\r\npeople, and left by the exclusive system of Europe without a market but\r\nours. 4th. That as the rivals of England in manufactures, in commerce,\r\nin navigation, and fisheries, they would meet her competition in every\r\npoint. 5th. That England would feel no scruples in making the abandonment\r\nand ruin of such a rival the price of a treaty with the producing\r\nStates; whose interest too it would be to nourish a navigation beyond\r\nthe Atlantic, rather than a hostile one at our own door. And 6th. That in\r\ncase of war with the Union, which occurrences between coterminous nations\r\nfrequently produce, it would be a contest of one against fifteen. The\r\nremaining portion of the Federal moiety of the State would, I believe,\r\nbrave all these obstacles, because they are monarchists in principle,\r\nbearing deadly hatred to their republican fellow-citizens, impatient under\r\nthe ascendency of republican principles, devoted in their attachment to\r\nEngland, and preferring to be placed under her despotism, if they cannot\r\nhold the helm of government here. I see, in their separation, no evil but\r\nthe example, and I believe that the effect of that would be corrected\r\nby an early and humiliating return to the Union, after losing much of\r\nthe population of their country, insufficient in its own resources to\r\nfeed her numerous inhabitants, and inferior in all its allurements to\r\nthe more inviting soils, climates, and governments of the other States.\r\nWhether a dispassionate discussion before the public, of the advantages\r\nand disadvantages of separation to both parties, would be the best\r\nmedicine for this dialytic fever, or to consider it as sacrilege ever\r\nto touch the question, may be doubted. I am, myself, generally disposed\r\nto indulge, and to follow reason; and believe that in no case would it\r\nbe safer than in the present. Their refractory course, however, will\r\nnot be unpunished by the indignation of their co-States, their loss\r\nof influence with them, the censures of history, and the stain on the\r\ncharacter of their State. With my thanks for the paper enclosed, accept\r\nthe assurance of my esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DOCTOR LOGAN.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, October 3, 1813.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have duly received your favor of September 18th, and I\r\nperceive in it the same spirit of peace which I know you have ever\r\nbreathed, and to preserve which you have made many personal sacrifices.\r\nThat your efforts did much towards preventing declared war with France,\r\nI am satisfied. Of those with England, I am not equally informed. I have\r\never cherished the same spirit with all nations, from a consciousness\r\nthat peace, prosperity, liberty, and morals, have an intimate connection.\r\nDuring the eight years of my administration, there was not a year that\r\nEngland did not give us such cause as would have provoked a war from\r\nany European government. But I always hoped that time and friendly\r\nremonstrances would bring her to a sounder view of her own interests,\r\nand convince her that these would be promoted by a return to justice\r\nand friendship towards us. Continued impressments of our seamen by her\r\nnaval commanders, whose interest it was to mistake them for theirs, her\r\ninnovations on the law of nations to cover real piracies, could illy be\r\nborne; and perhaps would not have been borne, had not contraventions of\r\nthe same law by France, fewer in number but equally illegal, rendered\r\nit difficult to single the object of war. England, at length, singled\r\nherself, and took up the gauntlet, when the unlawful decrees of France\r\nbeing revoked as to us, she, by the proclamation of her Prince Regent,\r\nprotested to the world that she would never revoke hers until those of\r\nFrance should be removed as to all nations. Her minister too, about\r\nthe same time, in an official conversation with our Chargé, rejected\r\nour substitute for her practice of impressment; proposed no other;\r\nand declared explicitly that no admissible one for this abuse could be\r\nproposed. Negotiation being thus cut short, no alternative remained but\r\nwar, or the abandonment of the persons and property of our citizens on\r\nthe ocean. The last one, I presume, no American would have preferred.\r\nWar was therefore declared, and justly declared; but accompanied with\r\nimmediate offers of peace on simply doing us justice. These offers were\r\nmade through Russel, through Admiral Warren, through the government of\r\nCanada, and the mediation proposed by her best friend Alexander, and the\r\ngreatest enemy of Bonaparte, was accepted without hesitation. An entire\r\nconfidence in the abilities and integrity of those now administering the\r\ngovernment, has kept me from the inclination, as well as the occasion,\r\nof intermeddling in the public affairs, even as a private citizen may\r\njustifiably do. Yet if you can suggest any conditions which we ought\r\nto accept, and which have not been repeatedly offered and rejected,\r\nI would not hesitate to become the channel of their communication\r\nto the administration. The revocation of the orders of council, and\r\ndiscontinuance of impressment, appear to me indispensable. And I think\r\na thousand ships taken unjustifiably in time of peace, and thousands\r\nof our citizens impressed, warrant expectations of indemnification;\r\nsuch a Western frontier, perhaps, given to Canada, as may put it out\r\nof their power hereafter to employ the tomahawk and scalping-knife\r\nof the Indians on our women and children; or, what would be nearly\r\nequivalent, the exclusive right to the lakes. The modification, however,\r\nof this indemnification must be effected by the events of the war. No\r\nman on earth has stronger detestation than myself of the unprincipled\r\ntyrant who is deluging the continent of Europe with blood. No one was\r\nmore gratified by his disasters of the last campaign; nor wished, more\r\nsincerely, success to the efforts of the virtuous Alexander. But the\r\ndesire of seeing England forced to just terms of peace with us, makes\r\nme equally solicitous for her entire exclusion from intercourse with the\r\nrest of the world, until by this peaceable engine of constraint, she can\r\nbe made to renounce her views of dominion over the ocean, of permitting\r\nno other nation to navigate it but with her license, and on tribute to\r\nher; and her aggressions on the persons of our citizens who may choose to\r\nexercise their right of passing over that element. Should the continental\r\narmistice issue in closing Europe against her, she may become willing\r\nto accede to just terms with us; which I should certainly be disposed to\r\nmeet, whatever consequences it might produce on our intercourse with the\r\ncontinental nations. My principle is to do whatever is right, and leave\r\nconsequences to Him who has the disposal of them. I repeat, therefore,\r\nthat if you can suggest what may lead to a just peace, I will willingly\r\ncommunicate it to the proper functionaries. In the meantime, its object\r\nwill be best promoted by a vigorous and unanimous prosecution of the war.\r\n\r\nI am happy in this occasion of renewing the interchange of sentiments\r\nbetween us, which has formerly been a source of much satisfaction to me;\r\nand with the homage of my affectionate attachment and respect to Mrs.\r\nLogan, I pray you to accept the assurance of my continued friendship\r\nand esteem for yourself.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n                                              MONTICELLO, October 13, 1813.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Since mine of August the 22d, I have received your favors of\r\nAugust the 16th, September the 2d, 14th, 15th, and--, and Mrs. Adams' of\r\nSeptember the 20th. I now send you, according to your request, a copy of\r\nthe syllabus. To fill up this skeleton with arteries, with veins, with\r\nnerves, muscles and flesh, is really beyond my time and information.\r\nWhoever could undertake it would find great aid in Enfield's judicious\r\nabridgment of Brucker's History of Philosophy, in which he has reduced\r\nfive or six quarto volumes, of one thousand pages each of Latin closely\r\nprinted, to two moderate octavos of English open type.\r\n\r\nTo compare the morals of the Old, with those of the New Testament, would\r\nrequire an attentive study of the former, a search through all its books\r\nfor its precepts, and through all its history for its practices, and the\r\nprinciples they prove. As commentaries, too, on these, the philosophy\r\nof the Hebrews must be inquired into, their Mishna, their Gemara,\r\nCabbala, Jezirah, Sohar, Cosri, and their Talmud, must be examined and\r\nunderstood, in order to do them full justice. Brucker, it would seem,\r\nhas gone deeply into these repositories of their ethics, and Enfield his\r\nepitomizer, concludes in these words: \"Ethics were so little understood\r\namong the Jews, that in their whole compilation called the Talmud, there\r\nis only one treatise on moral subjects. Their books of morals chiefly\r\nconsisted in a minute enumeration of duties. From the law of Moses were\r\ndeduced six hundred and thirteen precepts, which were divided into two\r\nclasses, affirmative and negative, two hundred and forty-eight in the\r\nformer, and three hundred and sixty-five in the latter. It may serve to\r\ngive the reader some idea of the low state of moral philosophy among the\r\nJews in the middle age, to add that of the two hundred and forty-eight\r\naffirmative precepts, only three were considered as obligatory upon\r\nwomen, and that in order to obtain salvation, it was judged sufficient\r\nto fulfil any one single law in the hour of death; the observance of\r\nthe rest being deemed necessary, only to increase the felicity of the\r\nfuture life. What a wretched depravity of sentiment and manners must\r\nhave prevailed, before such corrupt maxims could have obtained credit!\r\nIt is impossible to collect from these writings a consistent series of\r\nmoral doctrine.\" Enfield, B. 4, chap. 3. It was the reformation of this\r\n\"wretched depravity\" of morals which Jesus undertook. In extracting\r\nthe pure principles which he taught, we should have to strip off the\r\nartificial vestments in which they have been muffled by priests, who\r\nhave travestied them into various forms, as instruments of riches and\r\npower to themselves. We must dismiss the Platonists and Plotinists, the\r\nStagyrites and Gamalielites, the Eclectics, the Gnostics and Scholastics,\r\ntheir essences and emanations, their Logos and Demiurgos, Æons and\r\nDæmons, male and female, with a long train of &c. &c. &c., or, shall\r\nI say at once, of nonsense. We must reduce our volume to the simple\r\nevangelists, select, even from them, the very words only of Jesus, paring\r\noff the amphiboligisms into which they have been led, by forgetting\r\noften, or not understanding, what had fallen from him, by giving their\r\nown misconceptions as his dicta, and expressing unintelligibly for\r\nothers what they had not understood themselves. There will be found\r\nremaining the most sublime and benevolent code of morals which has ever\r\nbeen offered to man. I have performed this operation for my own use,\r\nby cutting verse by verse out of the printed book, and arranging the\r\nmatter which is evidently his, and which is as easily distinguishable\r\nas diamonds in a dunghill. The result is an octavo of forty-six pages,\r\nof pure and unsophisticated doctrines, such as were professed and\r\nacted on by the _unlettered_ Apostles, the Apostolic Fathers, and the\r\nChristians of the first century. Their Platonising successors, indeed,\r\nin after times, in order to legitimate the corruptions which they had\r\nincorporated into the doctrines of Jesus, found it necessary to disavow\r\nthe primitive Christians, who had taken their principles from the mouth\r\nof Jesus himself, of his Apostles, and the Fathers cotemporary with them.\r\nThey excommunicated their followers as heretics, branding them with the\r\nopprobrious name of Ebionites or Beggars.\r\n\r\nFor a comparison of the Grecian philosophy with that of Jesus, materials\r\nmight be largely drawn from the same source. Enfield gives a history and\r\ndetailed account of the opinions and principles of the different sects.\r\nThese relate to the Gods, their natures, grades, places and powers;\r\nthe demi-Gods and Dæmons, and their agency with man; the universe, its\r\nstructure, extent and duration; the origin of things from the elements of\r\nfire, water, air and earth; the human soul, its essence and derivation;\r\nthe _summum bonum_ and _finis bonorum_; with a thousand idle dreams and\r\nfancies on these and other subjects, the knowledge of which is withheld\r\nfrom man; leaving but a short chapter for his moral duties, and the\r\nprincipal section of that given to what he owes himself, to precepts\r\nfor rendering him impassible, and unassailable by the evils of life,\r\nand for preserving his mind in a state of constant serenity.\r\n\r\nSuch a canvas is too broad for the age of seventy, and especially of one\r\nwhose chief occupations have been in the practical business of life.\r\nWe must leave, therefore, to others, younger and more learned than\r\nwe are, to prepare this euthanasia for Platonic Christianity, and its\r\nrestoration to the primitive simplicity of its founder. I think you give\r\na just outline of the theism of the three religions, when you say that\r\nthe principle of the Hebrew was the fear, of the Gentile the honor, and\r\nof the Christian the love of God.\r\n\r\nAn expression in your letter of September the 14th, that \"the human\r\nunderstanding is a revelation from its maker,\" gives the best solution\r\nthat I believe can be given of the question, \"what did Socrates mean by\r\nhis Dæmon?\" He was too wise to believe, and too honest to pretend, that\r\nhe had real and familiar converse with a superior and invisible being.\r\nHe probably considered the suggestions of his conscience, or reason, as\r\nrevelations or inspirations from the Supreme mind, bestowed, on important\r\noccasions, by a special superintending Providence.\r\n\r\nI acknowledge all the merit of the hymn of Cleanthes to Jupiter, which\r\nyou ascribe to it. It is as highly sublime as a chaste and correct\r\nimagination can permit itself to go. Yet in the contemplation of a being\r\nso superlative, the hyperbolic flights of the Psalmist may often be\r\nfollowed with approbation, even with rapture; and I have no hesitation\r\nin giving him the palm over all the hymnists of every language and of\r\nevery time. Turn to the 148th psalm, in Brady and Tate's version. Have\r\nsuch conceptions been ever before expressed? Their version of the 15th\r\npsalm is more to be esteemed for its pithiness than its poetry. Even\r\nSternhold, the leaden Sternhold, kindles, in a single instance, with the\r\nsublimity of his original, and expresses the majesty of God descending\r\non the earth, in terms not unworthy of the subject:\r\n\r\n     \"The Lord descended from above,\r\n     And underneath his feet he cast\r\n     On Cherubim and Seraphim\r\n     And on the wings of mighty winds\r\n     And bowed the heav'ns most high;\r\n     The darkness of the sky.\r\n     Full royally he rode;\r\n     Came flying all abroad.\"--Psalm xviii. 9, 10.\r\n\r\nThe Latin versions of this passage by Buchanan and by Johnston, are but\r\nmediocres. But the Greek of Duport is worthy of quotation,\r\n\r\n     Ουρανον αγκλινας κατεβη· υπο πὸσσι δ' εοισιν\r\n     Αχλύς αμφι μελαινα χυθη και νυξ ερεβεννη.\r\n     Ῥιμφα ποτατο χερουβω οχευμενος, ωσπερ εφ' ιππω·\r\n     Ἱπτατο δε πτερυγεσσι πολυπλαγκτου ανεμοιο.\r\n\r\nThe best collection of these psalms is that of the Octagonian dissenters\r\nof Liverpool, in their printed form of prayer; but they are not always\r\nthe best versions. Indeed, bad is the best of the English versions; not\r\na ray of poetical genius having ever been employed on them. And how\r\nmuch depends on this, may be seen by comparing Brady and Tate's 15th\r\npsalm with Blacklock's _Justum et tenacem propositi virum_ of Horace,\r\nquoted in Hume's history, Car. 2, ch. 65. A translation of David in\r\nthis style, or in that of Pompei's Cleanthes, might give us some idea\r\nof the merit of the original. The character, too, of the poetry of\r\nthese hymns is singular to us; written in monostichs, each divided into\r\nstrophe and anti-strophe, the sentiment of the first member responded\r\nwith amplification or antithesis in the second.\r\n\r\nOn the subject of the postscript of yours of August the 16th and of Mrs.\r\nAdams' letter, I am silent. I know the depth of the affliction it has\r\ncaused, and can sympathise with it the more sensibly, inasmuch as there\r\nis no degree of affliction, produced by the loss of those dear to us,\r\nwhich experience has not taught me to estimate. I have ever found time\r\nand silence the only medicine, and these but assuage, they never can\r\nsuppress, the deep drawn sigh which recollection forever brings up, until\r\nrecollection and life are extinguished together. Ever affectionately\r\nyours.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n                                              MONTICELLO, October 28, 1813.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--According to the reservation between us, of taking up one of\r\nthe subjects of our correspondence at a time, I turn to your letters of\r\nAugust the 16th and September the 2d.\r\n\r\nThe passage you quote from Theognis, I think has an ethical rather\r\nthan a political object. The whole piece is a moral _exhortation_,\r\nπαραινεσις, and this passage particularly seems to be a reproof to man,\r\nwho, while with his domestic animals he is curious to improve the race,\r\nby employing always the finest male, pays no attention to the improvement\r\nof his own race, but intermarries with the vicious, the ugly, or the\r\nold, for considerations of wealth or ambition. It is in conformity with\r\nthe principle adopted afterwards by the Pythagoreans, and expressed by\r\nOcellus in another form; περι δε τῆς ἐκ τῶν αλληλων ανθρωπων γενεσεως\r\n&c.--ουχ ηδονης ενεκα η μιξις: which, as literally as intelligibility\r\nwill admit, may be thus translated: \"concerning the interprocreation of\r\nmen, how, and of whom it shall be, in a perfect manner, and according to\r\nthe laws of modesty and sanctity, conjointly, this is what I think right.\r\nFirst to lay it down that we do not commix for the sake of pleasure, but\r\nof the procreation of children. For the powers, the organs and desires\r\nfor coition have not been given by God to man for the sake of pleasure,\r\nbut for the procreation of the race. For as it were incongruous, for\r\na mortal born to partake of divine life, the immortality of the race\r\nbeing taken away, God fulfilled the purpose by making the generations\r\nuninterrupted and continuous. This, therefore, we are especially to lay\r\ndown as a principle, that coition is not for the sake of pleasure.\" But\r\nnature, not trusting to this moral and abstract motive, seems to have\r\nprovided more securely for the perpetuation of the species, by making it\r\nthe effect of the _oestrum_ implanted in the constitution of both sexes.\r\nAnd not only has the commerce of love been indulged on this unhallowed\r\nimpulse, but made subservient also to wealth and ambition by marriage,\r\nwithout regard to the beauty, the healthiness, the understanding, or\r\nvirtue of the subject from which we are to breed. The selecting the\r\nbest male for a Harem of well chosen females also, which Theognis seems\r\nto recommend from the example of our sheep and asses, would doubtless\r\nimprove the human, as it does the brute animal, and produce a race of\r\nveritable ἄριστοι. For experience proves, that the moral and physical\r\nqualities of man, whether good or evil, are transmissible in a certain\r\ndegree from father to son. But I suspect that the equal rights of men\r\nwill rise up against this privileged Solomon and his Haram, and oblige\r\nus to continue acquiescence under the \"Αμαυρωσις γενεος αστων\" which\r\nTheognis complains of, and to content ourselves with the accidental\r\naristoi produced by the fortuitous concourse of breeders. For I agree\r\nwith you that there is a natural aristocracy among men. The grounds of\r\nthis are virtue and talents. Formerly, bodily powers gave place among\r\nthe aristoi. But since the invention of gunpowder has armed the weak as\r\nwell as the strong with missile death, bodily strength, like beauty, good\r\nhumor, politeness and other accomplishments, has become but an auxiliary\r\nground of distinction. There is also an artificial aristocracy, founded\r\non wealth and birth, without either virtue or talents; for with these\r\nit would belong to the first class. The natural aristocracy I consider\r\nas the most precious gift of nature, for the instruction, the trusts,\r\nand government of society. And indeed, it would have been inconsistent\r\nin creation to have formed man for the social state, and not to have\r\nprovided virtue and wisdom enough to manage the concerns of the society.\r\nMay we not even say, that that form of government is the best, which\r\nprovides the most effectually for a pure selection of these natural\r\naristoi into the offices of government? The artificial aristocracy is\r\na mischievous ingredient in government, and provision should be made to\r\nprevent its ascendency. On the question, what is the best provision, you\r\nand I differ; but we differ as rational friends, using the free exercise\r\nof our own reason, and mutually indulging its errors. You think it best\r\nto put the pseudo-aristoi into a separate chamber of legislation, where\r\nthey may be hindered from doing mischief by their co-ordinate branches,\r\nand where, also, they may be a protection to wealth against the Agrarian\r\nand plundering enterprises of the majority of the people. I think that\r\nto give them power in order to prevent them from doing mischief, is\r\narming them for it, and increasing instead of remedying the evil. For\r\nif the co-ordinate branches can arrest their action, so may they that of\r\nthe co-ordinates. Mischief may be done negatively as well as positively.\r\nOf this, a cabal in the Senate of the United States has furnished many\r\nproofs. Nor do I believe them necessary to protect the wealthy; because\r\nenough of these will find their way into every branch of the legislation,\r\nto protect themselves. From fifteen to twenty legislatures of our own, in\r\naction for thirty years past, have proved that no fears of an equalization\r\nof property are to be apprehended from them. I think the best remedy is\r\nexactly that provided by all our constitutions, to leave to the citizens\r\nthe free election and separation of the aristoi from the pseudo-aristoi,\r\nof the wheat from the chaff. In general they will elect the really good\r\nand wise. In some instances, wealth may corrupt, and birth blind them;\r\nbut not in sufficient degree to endanger the society.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that our difference of opinion may, in some measure, be\r\nproduced by a difference of character in those among whom we live. From\r\nwhat I have seen of Massachusetts and Connecticut myself, and still more\r\nfrom what I have heard, and the character given of the former by yourself,\r\n(vol. 1, page 111,) who know them so much better, there seems to be in\r\nthose two States a traditionary reverence for certain families, which\r\nhas rendered the offices of the government nearly hereditary in those\r\nfamilies. I presume that from an early period of your history, members\r\nof those families happening to possess virtue and talents, have honestly\r\nexercised them for the good of the people, and by their services have\r\nendeared their names to them. In coupling Connecticut with you, I mean\r\nit politically only, not morally. For having made the Bible the common\r\nlaw of their land, they seem to have modeled their morality on the story\r\nof Jacob and Laban. But although this hereditary succession to office\r\nwith you, may, in some degree, be founded in real family merit, yet in a\r\nmuch higher degree, it has proceeded from your strict alliance of Church\r\nand State. These families are canonised in the eyes of the people on\r\ncommon principles, \"you tickle me, and I will tickle you.\" In Virginia\r\nwe have nothing of this. Our clergy, before the revolution, having been\r\nsecured against rivalship by fixed salaries, did not give themselves the\r\ntrouble of acquiring influence over the people. Of wealth, there were\r\ngreat accumulations in particular families, handed down from generation\r\nto generation, under the English law of entails. But the only object of\r\nambition for the wealthy was a seat in the King's Council. All their court\r\nthen was paid to the crown and its creatures; and they Philipised in all\r\ncollisions between the King and the people. Hence they were unpopular;\r\nand that unpopularity continues attached to their names. A Randolph, a\r\nCarter, or a Burwell must have great personal superiority over a common\r\ncompetitor to be elected by the people even at this day. At the first\r\nsession of our legislature after the Declaration of Independence, we\r\npassed a law abolishing entails. And this was followed by one abolishing\r\nthe privilege of primogeniture, and dividing the lands of intestates\r\nequally among all their children, or other representatives. These laws,\r\ndrawn by myself, laid the axe to the foot of pseudo-aristocracy. And\r\nhad another which I prepared been adopted by the legislature, our work\r\nwould have been complete. It was a bill for the more general diffusion\r\nof learning. This proposed to divide every county into wards of five\r\nor six miles square, like your townships; to establish in each ward\r\na free school for reading, writing and common arithmetic; to provide\r\nfor the annual selection of the best subjects from these schools, who\r\nmight receive, at the public expense, a higher degree of education at\r\na district school; and from these district schools to select a certain\r\nnumber of the most promising subjects, to be completed at an University,\r\nwhere all the useful sciences should be taught. Worth and genius would\r\nthus have been sought out from every condition of life, and completely\r\nprepared by education for defeating the competition of wealth and birth\r\nfor public trusts. My proposition had, for a further object, to impart\r\nto these wards those portions of self-government for which they are best\r\nqualified, by confiding to them the care of their poor, their roads,\r\npolice, elections, the nomination of jurors, administration of justice\r\nin small cases, elementary exercises of militia; in short, to have made\r\nthem little republics, with a warden at the head of each, for all those\r\nconcerns which, being under their eye, they would better manage than the\r\nlarger republics of the county or State. A general call of ward meetings\r\nby their wardens on the same day through the State, would at any time\r\nproduce the genuine sense of the people on any required point, and would\r\nenable the State to act in mass, as your people have so often done, and\r\nwith so much effect by their town meetings. The law for religious freedom,\r\nwhich made a part of this system, having put down the aristocracy of\r\nthe clergy, and restored to the citizen the freedom of the mind, and\r\nthose of entails and descents nurturing an equality of condition among\r\nthem, this on education would have raised the mass of the people to\r\nthe high ground of moral respectability necessary to their own safety,\r\nand to orderly government; and would have completed the great object\r\nof qualifying them to select the veritable aristoi, for the trusts of\r\ngovernment, to the exclusion of the pseudalists; and the same Theognis\r\nwho has furnished the epigraphs of your two letters, assures us that\r\n\"Ουδεμιαν πω, Κυρν', αγαθοι πολιν ωλεσαν ανδρες.\" Although this law has\r\nnot yet been acted on but in a small and inefficient degree, it is still\r\nconsidered as before the legislature, with other bills of the revised\r\ncode, not yet taken up, and I have great hope that some patriotic spirit\r\nwill, at a favorable moment, call it up, and make it the key-stone of\r\nthe arch of our government.\r\n\r\nWith respect to aristocracy, we should further consider, that before\r\nthe establishment of the American States, nothing was known to history\r\nbut the man of the old world, crowded within limits either small or\r\novercharged, and steeped in the vices which that situation generates. A\r\ngovernment adapted to such men would be one thing; but a very different\r\none, that for the man of these States. Here every one may have land to\r\nlabor for himself, if he chooses; or, preferring the exercise of any\r\nother industry, may exact for it such compensation as not only to afford\r\na comfortable subsistence, but wherewith to provide for a cessation from\r\nlabor in old age. Every one, by his property, or by his satisfactory\r\nsituation, is interested in the support of law and order. And such men\r\nmay safely and advantageously reserve to themselves a wholesome control\r\nover their public affairs, and a degree of freedom, which, in the hands\r\nof the _canaille_ of the cities of Europe, would be instantly perverted\r\nto the demolition and destruction of everything public and private. The\r\nhistory of the last twenty-five years of France, and of the last forty\r\nyears in America, nay of its last two hundred years, proves the truth\r\nof both parts of this observation.\r\n\r\nBut even in Europe a change has sensibly taken place in the mind of\r\nman. Science had liberated the ideas of those who read and reflect, and\r\nthe American example had kindled feelings of right in the people. An\r\ninsurrection has consequently begun, of science, talents, and courage,\r\nagainst rank and birth, which have fallen into contempt. It has failed\r\nin its first effort, because the mobs of the cities, the instrument\r\nused for its accomplishment, debased by ignorance, poverty, and vice,\r\ncould not be restrained to rational action. But the world will recover\r\nfrom the panic of this first catastrophe. Science is progressive, and\r\ntalents and enterprise on the alert. Resort may be had to the people\r\nof the country, a more governable power from their principles and\r\nsubordination; and rank, and birth, and tinsel-aristocracy will finally\r\nshrink into insignificance, even there. This, however, we have no right\r\nto meddle with. It suffices for us, if the moral and physical condition\r\nof our own citizens qualifies them to select the able and good for the\r\ndirection of their government, with a recurrence of elections at such\r\nshort periods as will enable them to displace an unfaithful servant,\r\nbefore the mischief he meditates may be irremediable.\r\n\r\nI have thus stated my opinion on a point on which we differ, not with a\r\nview to controversy, for we are both too old to change opinions which\r\nare the result of a long life of inquiry and reflection; but on the\r\nsuggestions of a former letter of yours, that we ought not to die before\r\nwe have explained ourselves to each other. We acted in perfect harmony,\r\nthrough a long and perilous contest for our liberty and independence.\r\nA constitution has been acquired, which, though neither of us thinks\r\nperfect, yet both consider as competent to render our fellow citizens\r\nthe happiest and the securest on whom the sun has ever shone. If we do\r\nnot think exactly alike as to its imperfections, it matters little to\r\nour country, which, after devoting to it long lives of disinterested\r\nlabor, we have delivered over to our successors in life, who will be\r\nable to take care of it and of themselves.\r\n\r\nOf the pamphlet on aristocracy which has been sent to you, or who may be\r\nits author, I have heard nothing but through your letter. If the person\r\nyou suspect, it may be known from the quaint, mystical, and hyperbolical\r\nideas, involved in affected, new-fangled and pedantic terms which stamp\r\nhis writings. Whatever it be, I hope your quiet is not to be affected\r\nat this day by the rudeness or intemperance of scribblers; but that you\r\nmay continue in tranquillity to live and to rejoice in the prosperity\r\nof our country, until it shall be your own wish to take your seat among\r\nthe aristoi who have gone before you. Ever and affectionately yours.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN W. EPPES.\r\n\r\n                                              MONTICELLO, November 6, 1813.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I had not expected to have troubled you again on the subject\r\nof finance; but since the date of my last, I have received from Mr. Law\r\na letter covering a memorial on that subject, which, from its tenor, I\r\nconjecture must have been before Congress at their two last sessions.\r\nThis paper contains two propositions; the one for issuing treasury\r\nnotes, bearing interest, and to be circulated as money; the other for\r\nthe establishment of a national bank. The first was considered in my\r\nformer letter; and the second shall be the subject of the present.\r\n\r\nThe scheme is for Congress to establish a national bank, suppose of\r\nthirty millions capital, of which they shall contribute ten millions in\r\nnew six per cent. stock, the States ten millions, and individuals ten\r\nmillions, one half of the two last contributions to be of similar stock,\r\nfor which the parties are to give cash to Congress; the whole, however,\r\nto be under the exclusive management of the individual subscribers, who\r\nare to name all the directors; neither Congress nor the States having any\r\npower of interference in its administration. Discounts are to be at five\r\nper cent., but the profits are expected to be seven per cent. Congress\r\nthen will be paying six per cent. on twenty millions, and receiving seven\r\nper cent. on ten millions, being its third of the institution; so that on\r\nthe ten millions cash which they receive from the States and individuals,\r\nthey will, in fact, have to pay but five per cent. interest. This is the\r\nbait. The charter is proposed to be for forty or fifty years, and if any\r\nfuture augmentations should take place, the individual proprietors are\r\nto have the privilege of being the sole subscribers for that. Congress\r\nare further allowed to issue to the amount of three millions of notes,\r\nbearing interest, which they are to receive back in payment for lands\r\nat a premium of five or ten per cent., or as subscriptions for canals,\r\nroads, and bridges, in which undertakings they are, of course, to be\r\nengaged. This is a summary of the case as I understand it; but it is\r\nvery possible I may not understand it in all its parts, these schemes\r\nbeing always made unintelligible for the gulls who are to enter into\r\nthem. The advantages and disadvantages shall be noted promiscuously as\r\nthey occur; leaving out the speculation of canals, &c., which, being an\r\nepisode only in the scheme, may be omitted, to disentangle it as much\r\nas we can.\r\n\r\n1. Congress are to receive five millions from the States (if they will\r\nenter into this partnership, which few probably will), and five millions\r\nfrom the individual subscribers, in exchange for ten millions of six per\r\ncent. stock, one per cent. of which, however, they will make on their\r\nten millions of stock remaining in bank, and so reduce it, in effect,\r\nto a loan of ten millions at five per cent. interest. This is good; but\r\n\r\n2. They authorize this bank to throw into circulation ninety millions\r\nof dollars, (three times the capital,) which increases our circulating\r\nmedium fifty per cent., depreciates proportionably the present value\r\nof a dollar, and raises the price of all future purchases in the same\r\nproportion.\r\n\r\n3. This loan of ten millions at five per cent., is to be once for all,\r\nonly. Neither the terms of the scheme, nor their own prudence could ever\r\npermit them to add to the circulation in the same, or any other way,\r\nfor the supplies of the succeeding years of the war. These succeeding\r\nyears then are to be left unprovided for, and the means of doing it in\r\na great measure precluded.\r\n\r\n4. The individual subscribers, on paying their own five millions of cash\r\nto Congress, become the depositories of ten millions of stock belonging\r\nto Congress, five millions belonging to the States, and five millions\r\nto themselves, say twenty millions, with which, as no one has a right\r\never to see their books, or to ask a question, they may choose their\r\ntime for running away, after adding to their booty the proceeds of as\r\nmuch of their own notes as they shall be able to throw into circulation.\r\n\r\n5. The subscribers may be one, two, or three, or more individuals, (many\r\nsingle individuals being able to pay in the five millions,) whereupon\r\nthis bank oligarchy or monarchy enters the field with ninety millions\r\nof dollars, to direct and control the politics of the nation; and of the\r\ninfluence of these institutions on our politics, and into what scale it\r\nwill be thrown, we have had abundant experience. Indeed, England herself\r\nmay be the real, while her friend and trustee here shall be the nominal\r\nand sole subscriber.\r\n\r\n6. This state of things is to be fastened on us, without the power of\r\nrelief, for forty or fifty years. That is to say, the eight millions of\r\npeople now existing, for the sake of receiving one dollar and twenty-five\r\ncents apiece, at five per cent. interest, are to subject the fifty\r\nmillions of people who are to succeed them within that term, to the\r\npayment of forty-five millions of dollars, principal and interest, which\r\nwill be payable in the course of the fifty years.\r\n\r\n7. But the great and national advantage is to be the relief of the\r\npresent _scarcity of money_, which is produced and proved by,\r\n\r\n1. The additional industry created to supply a variety of articles for\r\nthe troops, ammunition, &c.\r\n\r\n2. By the cash sent to the frontiers, and the vacuum occasioned in the\r\ntrading towns by that.\r\n\r\n3. By the late loans.\r\n\r\n4. By the necessity of recurring to shavers with _good_ paper, which\r\nthe existing banks are not able to take up; and\r\n\r\n5. By the numerous applications of bank charters, showing that an increase\r\nof circulating medium is wanting.\r\n\r\nLet us examine these causes and proofs of the want of an increase of\r\nmedium, one by one.\r\n\r\n1. The additional industry created to supply a variety of articles for\r\ntroops, ammunition, &c. Now, I had always supposed that war produced\r\na diminution of industry, by the number of hands it withdraws from\r\nindustrious pursuits for employment in arms, &c., which are totally\r\nunproductive. And if it calls for new industry in the articles of\r\nammunition and other military supplies, the hands are borrowed from\r\nother branches on which the demand is slackened by the war; so that it\r\nis but a shifting of these hands from one pursuit to another.\r\n\r\n2. The cash sent to the frontiers occasions a vacuum in the trading\r\ntowns, which requires a new supply. Let us examine what are the calls\r\nfor money to the frontiers. Not for clothing, tents, ammunition, arms,\r\nwhich are all bought in the trading towns. Not for provisions; for\r\nalthough these are bought partly in the immediate country, bank bills\r\nare more acceptable there than even in the trading towns. The pay of\r\nthe army calls for some cash, but not a great deal, as bank notes are\r\nas acceptable with the military men, perhaps more so; and what cash\r\nis sent must find its way back again in exchange for the wants of the\r\nupper from the lower country. For we are not to suppose that cash stays\r\naccumulating there forever.\r\n\r\n3. This scarcity has been occasioned by the late loans. But does the\r\ngovernment borrow money to keep it in their coffers? Is it not instantly\r\nrestored to circulation by payment for its necessary supplies? And are\r\nwe to restore a vacuum of twenty millions of dollars by an emission of\r\nninety millions?\r\n\r\n4. The want of medium is proved by the recurrence of individuals with\r\n_good_ paper to brokers at exorbitant interest; and\r\n\r\n5. By the numerous applications to the State governments for additional\r\nbanks; New York wanting eighteen millions, Pennsylvania ten millions,\r\n&c. But say more correctly, the speculators and spendthrifts of New York\r\nand Pennsylvania, but never consider them as being the States of New\r\nYork and Pennsylvania. These two items shall be considered together.\r\n\r\nIt is a litigated question, whether the circulation of paper, rather\r\nthan of specie, is a good or an evil. In the opinion of England and of\r\nEnglish writers it is a good; in that of all other nations it is an evil;\r\nand excepting England and her copyist, the United States, there is not\r\na nation existing, I believe, which tolerates a paper circulation. The\r\nexperiment is going on, however, desperately in England, pretty boldly\r\nwith us, and at the end of the chapter, we shall see which opinion\r\nexperience approves: for I believe it to be one of those cases where\r\nmercantile clamor will bear down reason, until it is corrected by ruin.\r\nIn the meantime, however, let us reason on this new call for a national\r\nbank.\r\n\r\nAfter the solemn decision of Congress against the renewal of the charter\r\nof the bank of the United States, and the grounds of that decision, (the\r\nwant of constitutional power,) I had imagined that question at rest, and\r\nthat no more applications would be made to them for the incorporation\r\nof banks. The opposition on that ground to its first establishment,\r\nthe small majority by which it was overborne, and the means practiced\r\nfor obtaining it, cannot be already forgotten. The law having passed,\r\nhowever, by a majority, its opponents, true to the sacred principle of\r\nsubmission to a majority, suffered the law to flow through its term\r\nwithout obstruction. During this, the nation had time to consider\r\nthe constitutional question, and when the renewal was proposed, they\r\ncondemned it, not by their representatives in Congress only, but by\r\nexpress instructions from different organs of their will. Here then we\r\nmight stop, and consider the memorial as answered. But, setting authority\r\napart, we will examine whether the Legislature ought to comply with it,\r\neven if they had the power.\r\n\r\nProceeding to reason on this subject, some principles must be premised as\r\nforming its basis. The adequate price of a thing depends on the capital\r\nand labor necessary to produce it. [In the term _capital_, I mean to\r\ninclude science, because capital as well as labor has been employed to\r\nacquire it.] Two things requiring the same capital and labor, should be\r\nof the same price. If a gallon of wine requires for its production the\r\nsame capital and labor with a bushel of wheat, they should be expressed\r\nby the same price, derived from the application of a common measure to\r\nthem. The comparative prices of things being thus to be estimated and\r\nexpressed by a common measure, we may proceed to observe, that were a\r\ncountry so insulated as to have no commercial intercourse with any other,\r\nto confine the interchange of all its wants and supplies within itself,\r\nthe amount of circulating medium, as a common measure for adjusting these\r\nexchanges, would be quite immaterial. If their circulation, for instance,\r\nwere of a million of dollars, and the annual produce of their industry\r\nequivalent to ten millions of bushels of wheat, the price of a bushel\r\nof wheat might be one dollar. If, then, by a progressive coinage, their\r\nmedium should be doubled, the price of a bushel of wheat might become\r\nprogressively two dollars, and without inconvenience. Whatever be the\r\nproportion of the circulating medium to the value of the annual produce\r\nof industry, it may be considered as the representative of that industry.\r\nIn the first case, a bushel of wheat will be represented by one dollar;\r\nin the second, by two dollars. This is well explained by Hume, and seems\r\nadmitted by Adam Smith, B. 2. c. 2, 436, 441, 490. But where a nation is\r\nin a full course of interchange of wants and supplies with all others,\r\nthe proportion of its medium to its produce is no longer indifferent.\r\nIb. 441. To trade on equal terms, the common measure of values should be\r\nas nearly as possible on a par with that of its corresponding nations,\r\nwhose medium is in a sound state; that is to say, not in an accidental\r\nstate of excess or deficiency. Now, one of the great advantages of specie\r\nas a medium is, that being of universal value, it will keep itself at a\r\ngeneral level, flowing out from where it is too high into parts where\r\nit is lower. Whereas, if the medium be of local value only, as paper\r\nmoney, if too little, indeed, gold and silver will flow in to supply the\r\ndeficiency; but if too much, it accumulates, banishes the gold and silver\r\nnot locked up in vaults and hoards, and depreciates itself; that is too\r\nsay, its proportion to the annual produce of industry being raised, more\r\nof it is required to represent any particular article of produce than\r\nin the other countries. This is agreed by Smith, (B. 2. c. 2. 437,) the\r\nprincipal advocate for a paper circulation; but advocating it on the\r\nsole condition that it be strictly regulated. He admits, nevertheless,\r\nthat \"the commerce and industry of a country cannot be so secure when\r\nsuspended on the Dædalian wings of paper money, as on the solid ground\r\nof gold and silver; and that in time of war, the insecurity is greatly\r\nincreased, and great confusion possible where the circulation is for the\r\ngreater part in paper.\" B. 2. c. 2. 484. But in a country where loans\r\nare uncertain, and a specie circulation the only sure resource for them,\r\nthe preference of that circulation assumes a far different degree of\r\nimportance, as is explained in my former letters.\r\n\r\nThe only advantage which Smith proposes by substituting paper in the room\r\nof gold and silver money, B. 2. c. 2. 434, is \"to replace an expensive\r\ninstrument with one much less costly, and _sometimes_ equally convenient;\"\r\nthat is to say, page 437, \"to allow the gold and silver to be sent abroad\r\nand converted into foreign goods,\" and to substitute paper as being a\r\ncheaper measure. But this makes no addition to the stock or capital of\r\nthe nation. The coin sent out was worth as much, while in the country,\r\nas the goods imported and taking its place. It is only, then, a change\r\nof form in a part of the national capital, from that of gold and silver\r\nto other goods. He admits, too, that while a part of the goods received\r\nin exchange for the coin exported may be materials, tools and provisions\r\nfor the employment of an additional industry, a part, also, may be\r\ntaken back in foreign wines, silks, &c., to be consumed by idle people\r\nwho produce nothing; and so far the substitution promotes prodigality,\r\nincreases expense and corruption, without increasing production. So far\r\nalso, then, it lessens the capital of the nation. What may be the amount\r\nwhich the conversion of the part exchanged for productive goods may add\r\nto the former productive mass, it is not easy to ascertain, because, as\r\nhe says, page 441, \"it is impossible to determine what is the proportion\r\nwhich the circulating money of any country bears to the whole value of\r\nthe annual produce. It has been computed by different authors, from a\r\nfifth[6] to a thirtieth of that value.\" In the United States it must be\r\nless than in any other part of the commercial world; because the great\r\nmass of their inhabitants being in responsible circumstances, the great\r\nmass of their exchanges in the country is effected on credit, in their\r\nmerchants' ledger, who supplies all their wants through the year, and at\r\nthe end of it receives the produce of their farms, or other articles of\r\ntheir industry. It is a fact, that a farmer with a revenue of ten thousand\r\ndollars a year, may obtain all his supplies from his merchant, and\r\nliquidate them at the end of the year, by the sale of his produce to him,\r\nwithout the intervention of a single dollar of cash. This, then, is merely\r\nbarter, and in this way of barter a great portion of the annual produce\r\nof the United States is exchanged without the intermediation of cash. We\r\nmight safely, then, state our medium at the minimum of one-thirtieth. But\r\nwhat is one-thirtieth of the value of the annual produce of the industry\r\nof the United States? Or what is the whole value of the annual produce\r\nof the United States? An able writer and competent judge of the subject,\r\nin 1799, on as good grounds as probably could be taken, estimated it,\r\non the then population of four and a half millions of inhabitants, to be\r\nthirty-seven and a half millions sterling, or one hundred and sixty-eight\r\nand three-fourths millions of dollars. See Cooper's Political Arithmetic,\r\npage 47. According to the same estimate for our present population, it\r\nwill be three hundred millions of dollars, one-thirtieth of which, Smith's\r\nminimum, would be ten millions, and one-fifth, his maximum, would be\r\nsixty millions for the quantum of circulation. But suppose that instead\r\nof our needing the least circulating medium of any nation, from the\r\ncircumstance before mentioned, we should place ourselves in the middle\r\nterm of the calculation, to-wit: at thirty-five millions. One-fifth of\r\nthis, at the least, Smith thinks should be retained in specie, which\r\nwould leave twenty-eight millions of specie to be exported in exchange\r\nfor other commodities; and if fifteen millions of that should be returned\r\nin productive goods, and not in articles of prodigality, that would be\r\nthe amount of capital which this operation would add to the existing\r\nmass. But to what mass? Not that of the three hundred millions, which is\r\nonly its gross annual produce, but to that capital of which the three\r\nhundred millions are but the annual produce. But this being gross, we\r\nmay infer from it the value of the capital by considering that the rent\r\nof lands is generally fixed at one-third of the gross produce, and is\r\ndeemed its nett profit, and twenty times that its fee simple value. The\r\nprofits on landed capital may, with accuracy enough for our purpose, be\r\nsupposed on a par with those of other capital. This would give us then\r\nfor the United States, a capital of two thousand millions, all in active\r\nemployment, and exclusive of unimproved lands lying in a great degree\r\ndormant. Of this, fifteen millions would be the hundred and thirty-third\r\npart. And it is for this petty addition to the capital of the nation,\r\nthis minimum of one dollar, added to one hundred and thirty-three and\r\na third or three-fourths per cent., that we are to give up our gold\r\nand silver medium, its intrinsic solidity, its universal value, and\r\nits saving powers in time of war, and to substitute for it paper, with\r\nall its train of evils, moral, political and physical, which I will not\r\npretend to enumerate.\r\n\r\nThere is another authority to which we may appeal for the proper quantity\r\nof circulating medium for the United States. The old Congress, when\r\nwe were estimated at about two millions of people, on a long and able\r\ndiscussion, June 22d, 1775, decided the sufficient quantity to be two\r\nmillions of dollars, which sum they then emitted.[7] According to this,\r\nit should be eight millions, now that we are eight millions of people.\r\nThis differs little from Smith's minimum of ten millions, and strengthens\r\nour respect for that estimate.\r\n\r\nThere is, indeed, a convenience in paper; its easy transmission from one\r\nplace to another. But this may be mainly supplied by bills of exchange,\r\nso as to prevent any great displacement of actual coin. Two places\r\ntrading together balance their dealings, for the most part, by their\r\nmutual supplies, and the debtor individuals of either may, instead of\r\ncash, remit the bills of those who are creditors in the same dealings; or\r\nmay obtain them through some third place with which both have dealings.\r\nThe cases would be rare where such bills could not be obtained, either\r\ndirectly or circuitously, and too unimportant to the nation to overweigh\r\nthe train of evils flowing from paper circulation.\r\n\r\nFrom eight to thirty-five millions then being our proper circulation,\r\nand two hundred millions the actual one, the memorial proposes to issue\r\nninety millions more, because, it says, a great scarcity of money is\r\nproved by the numerous applications for banks; to wit, New York for\r\neighteen millions, Pennsylvania ten millions, &c. The answer to this\r\nshall be quoted from Adam Smith, B. 2. c. 2. page 462; where speaking of\r\nthe complaints of the trader against the Scotch bankers, who had already\r\ngone too far in their issues of paper, he says, \"those traders and other\r\nundertakers having got so much assistance from banks, wished to get still\r\nmore. The banks, they seem to have thought, could extend their credits\r\nto whatever sum might be wanted, without incurring any other expense\r\nbesides that of a few reams of paper. They complained of the contracted\r\nviews and dastardly spirit of the directors of those banks, which did\r\nnot, they said, extend their credits in proportion to the extension of the\r\ntrade of the country; meaning, no doubt, by the extension of that trade,\r\nthe extension of their own projects beyond what they could carry on,\r\neither _with their own capital_, or with what they had credit to borrow\r\nof private people in the usual way of bond or mortgage. The banks, they\r\nseem to have thought, were in honor bound to supply the deficiency, and\r\nto provide them with all the capital which they wanted to trade with.\"\r\nAnd again, page 470: \"when bankers discovered that certain projectors\r\nwere trading, not with any capital of their own, but with that which they\r\nadvanced them, they endeavored to withdraw gradually, making every day\r\ngreater and greater difficulties about discounting. These difficulties\r\nalarmed and enraged in the highest degree those projectors. Their own\r\ndistress, of which this prudent and necessary reserve of the banks was\r\nno doubt the immediate occasion, they called the distress of the country;\r\nand this distress of the country, they said, was altogether owing to the\r\nignorance, pusillanimity, and bad conduct of the banks, which did not\r\ngive a sufficiently liberal aid to the spirited undertakings of those\r\nwho exerted themselves in order to beautify, improve and enrich the\r\ncountry. It was the duty of the banks, they seemed to think, to lend\r\nfor as long a time, and to as great an extent, as they might wish to\r\nborrow.\" It is, probably, the _good paper_ of these projectors which the\r\nmemorial says, the bank being _unable_ to discount, goes into the hands\r\nof brokers, who (knowing the risk of this _good paper_) discount it at\r\na much higher rate than legal interest, to the great distress of the\r\nenterprising adventurers, who had rather try trade on borrowed capital,\r\nthan go to the plough or other laborious calling. Smith again says,\r\npage 478, \"that the industry of Scotland languished for want of money\r\nto employ it, was the opinion of the famous Mr. Law. By establishing a\r\nbank of a particular kind, which, he seems to have imagined might issue\r\npaper to the amount of the whole value of all the lands in the country,\r\nhe proposed to remedy this want of money. It was afterwards adopted,\r\nwith some variations, by the Duke of Orleans, at that time Regent of\r\nFrance. The idea of the possibility of multiplying paper to almost any\r\nextent, was the real foundation of what is called the Mississippi scheme,\r\nthe most extravagant project both of banking and stock jobbing, that\r\nperhaps the world ever saw. The principles upon which it was founded are\r\nexplained by Mr. Law himself, in a discourse concerning money and trade,\r\nwhich he published in Scotland when he first proposed his project. The\r\nsplendid but visionary ideas which are set forth in that and some other\r\nworks upon the same principles, still continue to make an impression\r\nupon many people, and have perhaps, in part, contributed to that excess\r\nof banking which has of late been complained of both in Scotland and\r\nin other places.\" The Mississippi scheme, it is well known, ended in\r\nFrance in the bankruptcy of the public treasury, the crush of thousands\r\nand thousands of private fortunes, and scenes of desolation and distress\r\nequal to those of an invading army, burning and laying waste all before\r\nit.\r\n\r\nAt the time we were funding our national debt, we heard much about \"a\r\npublic debt being a public blessing;\" that the stock representing it was\r\na creation of active capital for the aliment of commerce, manufactures\r\nand agriculture. This paradox was well adapted to the minds of believers\r\nin dreams, and the gulls of that size entered _bonâ fide_ into it.\r\nBut the art and mystery of banks is a wonderful improvement on that.\r\nIt is established on the principle that \"_private_ debts are a public\r\nblessing.\" That the evidences of those private debts, called bank notes,\r\nbecome active capital, and aliment the whole commerce, manufactures,\r\nand agriculture of the United States. Here are a set of people, for\r\ninstance, who have bestowed on us the great blessing of running in our\r\ndebt about two hundred millions of dollars, without our knowing who\r\nthey are, where they are, or what property they have to pay this debt\r\nwhen called on; nay, who have made us so sensible of the blessings of\r\nletting them run in our debt, that we have exempted them by law from\r\nthe repayment of these debts beyond a given proportion, (generally\r\nestimated at one-third.) And to fill up the measure of blessing, instead\r\nof paying, they receive an interest on what they owe from those to whom\r\nthey owe; for all the notes, or evidences of what they owe, which we see\r\nin circulation, have been lent to somebody on an interest which is levied\r\nagain on us through the medium of commerce. And they are so ready still\r\nto deal out their liberalities to us, that they are now willing to let\r\nthemselves run in our debt ninety millions more, on our paying them the\r\nsame premium of six or eight per cent. interest, and on the same legal\r\nexemption from the repayment of more than thirty millions of the debt,\r\nwhen it shall be called for. But let us look at this principle in its\r\noriginal form, and its copy will then be equally understood. \"A public\r\ndebt is a public blessing.\" That our debt was juggled from forty-three\r\nup to eighty millions, and funded at that amount, according to this\r\nopinion was a great public blessing, because the evidences of it could\r\nbe vested in commerce, and thus converted into active capital, and then\r\nthe more the debt was made to be, the more active capital was created.\r\nThat is to say, the creditors could now employ in commerce the money\r\ndue them from the public, and make from it an annual profit of five per\r\ncent., or four millions of dollars. But observe, that the public were\r\nat the same time paying on it an interest of exactly the same amount of\r\nfour millions of dollars. Where then is the gain to either party, which\r\nmakes it a public blessing? There is no change in the state of things,\r\nbut of persons only. A has a debt due to him from the public, of which\r\nhe holds their certificate as evidence, and on which he is receiving an\r\nannual interest. He wishes, however, to have the money itself, and to\r\ngo into business with it. B has an equal sum of money in business, but\r\nwishes now to retire, and live on the interest. He therefore gives it\r\nto A in exchange for A's certificates of public stock. Now, then, A has\r\nthe money to employ in business, which B so employed before. B has the\r\nmoney on interest to live on, which A. lived on before; and the public\r\npays the interest to B. which they paid to A. before. Here is no new\r\ncreation of capital, no additional money employed, nor even a change in\r\nthe employment of a single dollar. The only change is of place between A\r\nand B in which we discover no creation of capital, nor public blessing.\r\nSuppose, again, the public to owe nothing. Then A not having lent his\r\nmoney to the public, would be in possession of it himself, and would\r\ngo into business without the previous operation of selling stock. Here\r\nagain, the same quantity of capital is employed as in the former case,\r\nthough no public debt exists. In neither case is there any creation of\r\nactive capital, nor other difference than that there is a public debt\r\nin the first case, and none in the last; and we may safely ask which of\r\nthe two situations is most truly a public blessing? If, then, a _public_\r\ndebt be no public blessing, we may pronounce, _à fortiori_, that a\r\nprivate one cannot be so. If the debt which the banking companies owe\r\nbe a blessing to any body, it is to themselves alone, who are realizing\r\na solid interest of eight or ten per cent. on it. As to the public,\r\nthese companies have banished all our gold and silver medium, which,\r\nbefore their institution, we had without interest, which never could\r\nhave perished in our hands, and would have been our salvation now in the\r\nhour of war; instead of which they have given us two hundred million of\r\nfroth and bubble, on which we are to pay them heavy interest, until it\r\nshall vanish into air, as Morris' notes did. We are warranted, then, in\r\naffirming that this parody on the principle of \"a public debt being a\r\npublic blessing,\" and its mutation into the blessing of private instead\r\nof public debts, is as ridiculous as the original principle itself. In\r\nboth cases, the truth is, that capital may be produced by industry, and\r\naccumulated by economy; but jugglers only will propose to create it by\r\nlegerdemain tricks with paper.\r\n\r\nI have called the actual circulation of bank paper in the United States,\r\ntwo hundred millions of dollars. I do not recollect where I have seen\r\nthis estimate; but I retain the impression that I thought it just at\r\nthe time. It may be tested, however, by a list of the banks now in\r\nthe United States, and the amount of their capital. I have no means of\r\nrecurring to such a list for the present day; but I turn to two lists\r\nin my possession for the years of 1803 and 1804.\r\n\r\n     In 1803, there were thirty-four banks, whose capital\r\n     was                                                      $28,902,000\r\n\r\n     In 1804, there were sixty-six, consequently thirty-two\r\n     additional ones. Their capital is not stated, but\r\n     at the average of the others, (excluding the highest,\r\n     that of the United States, which was of ten\r\n     millions,) they would be of six hundred thousand\r\n     dollars each, and add                                     19,200,000\r\n\r\n     Making a total of                                         ----------\r\n                                                              $48,102,000\r\n\r\nor say of fifty millions in round numbers. Now, every one knows the\r\nimmense multiplication of these institutions since 1804. If they have only\r\ndoubled, their capital will be of one hundred millions, and if trebled,\r\nas I think probable, it will be one hundred and fifty millions, on which\r\nthey are at liberty to circulate treble the amount. I should sooner,\r\ntherefore, believe two hundred millions to be far below than above the\r\nactual circulation. In England, by a late parliamentary document, (see\r\nVirginia Argus of October the 18th, 1813, and other public papers of\r\nabout that date,) it appears that six years ago the Bank of England had\r\ntwelve millions of pounds sterling in circulation, which had increased to\r\nforty-two millions in 1812, or to one hundred and eighty-nine millions\r\nof dollars. What proportion all the other banks may add to this, I do\r\nnot know; if we were allowed to suppose they equal it, this would give a\r\ncirculation of three hundred and seventy-eight millions, or the double of\r\nours on a double population. But that nation is essentially commercial,\r\nours essentially agricultural, and needing, therefore, less circulating\r\nmedium, because the produce of the husbandman comes but once a year,\r\nand is then partly consumed at home, partly exchanged by barter. The\r\ndollar, which was of four shilling and sixpence sterling, was, by the same\r\ndocument, stated to be then six shillings and nine pence, a depreciation\r\nof exactly fifty per cent. The average price of wheat on the continent\r\nof Europe, at the commencement of its present war with England, was about\r\na French crown, of one hundred and ten cents, the bushel. With us it was\r\none hundred cents, and consequently we could send it there in competition\r\nwith their own. That ordinary price has now doubled with us, and more\r\nthan doubled in England; and although a part of this augmentation may\r\nproceed from the war demand, yet from the extraordinary nominal rise in\r\nthe prices of land and labor here, both of which have nearly doubled in\r\nthat period, and are still rising with every new bank, it is evident that\r\nwere a general peace to take place to-morrow, and time allowed for the\r\nre-establishment of commerce, justice, and order, we could not afford\r\nto raise wheat for much less than two dollars, while the continent of\r\nEurope, having no paper circulation, and that of its specie not being\r\naugmented, would raise it at their former price of one hundred and ten\r\ncents. It follows, then, that with our redundancy of paper, we cannot,\r\nafter peace, send a bushel of wheat to Europe, unless extraordinary\r\ncircumstances double its price in particular places, and that then the\r\nexporting countries of Europe could undersell us.\r\n\r\nIt is said that our paper is as good as silver, because we may have\r\nsilver for it at the bank where it issues. This is not true. One, two,\r\nor three persons might have it; but a general application would soon\r\nexhaust their vaults, and leave a ruinous proportion of their paper in\r\nits intrinsic worthless form. It is a fallacious pretence, for another\r\nreason. The inhabitants of the banking cities might obtain cash for their\r\npaper, as far as the cash of the vaults would hold out, but distance\r\nputs it out of the power of the country to do this. A farmer having a\r\nnote of a Boston or Charleston bank, distant hundreds of miles, has no\r\nmeans of calling for the cash. And while these calls are impracticable\r\nfor the country, the banks have no fear of their being made from the\r\ntowns; because their inhabitants are mostly on their books, and there\r\non sufferance only, and during good behavior.\r\n\r\nIn this state of things, we are called on to add ninety millions more\r\nto the circulation. Proceeding in this career, it is infallible, that\r\nwe must end where the revolutionary paper ended. Two hundred millions\r\nwas the whole amount of all the emissions of the old Congress, at which\r\npoint their bills ceased to circulate. We are now at that sum, but with\r\ntreble the population, and of course a longer tether. Our depreciation\r\nis, as yet, but about two for one. Owing to the support its credit\r\nreceives from the small reservoirs of specie in the vaults of the\r\nbanks, it is impossible to say at what point their notes will stop.\r\nNothing is necessary to effect it but a general alarm; and that may take\r\nplace whenever the public shall begin to reflect on, and perceive the\r\nimpossibility that the banks should repay this sum. At present, caution\r\nis inspired no farther than to keep prudent men from selling property\r\non long payments. Let us suppose the panic to arise at three hundred\r\nmillions, a point to which every session of the legislatures hasten us by\r\nlong strides. Nobody dreams that they would have three hundred millions\r\nof specie to satisfy the holders of their notes. Were they even to stop\r\nnow, no one supposes they have two hundred millions in cash, or even the\r\nsixty-six and two-third millions, to which amount alone the law compels\r\nthem to repay. One hundred and thirty-three and one-third millions of\r\nloss, then, is thrown on the public by law; and as to the sixty-six and\r\ntwo-thirds, which they are legally bound to pay, and ought to have in\r\ntheir vaults, every one knows there is no such amount of cash in the\r\nUnited States, and what would be the course with what they really have\r\nthere? Their notes are refused. Cash is called for. The inhabitants\r\nof the banking towns will get what is in the vaults, until a few banks\r\ndeclare their insolvency; when, the general crush becoming evident, the\r\nothers will withdraw even the cash they have, declare their bankruptcy\r\nat once, and leave an empty house and empty coffers for the holders of\r\ntheir notes. In this scramble of creditors, the country gets nothing,\r\nthe towns but little. What are they to do? Bring suits? A million\r\nof creditors bring a million of suits against John Nokes and Robert\r\nStyles, wheresoever to be found? All nonsense. The loss is total. And\r\na sum is thus swindled from our citizens, of seven times the amount of\r\nthe real debt, and four times that of the fictitious one of the United\r\nStates, at the close of the war. All this they will justly charge on\r\ntheir legislatures; but this will be poor satisfaction for the two or\r\nthree hundred millions they will have lost. It is time, then, for the\r\npublic functionaries to look to this. Perhaps it may not be too late.\r\nPerhaps, by giving time to the banks, they may call in and pay off their\r\npaper by degrees. But no remedy is ever to be expected while it rests\r\nwith the State legislatures. Personal motive can be excited through so\r\nmany avenues to their will, that, in their hands, it will continue to\r\ngo on from bad to worse, until the catastrophe overwhelms us. I still\r\nbelieve, however, that on proper representations of the subject, a great\r\nproportion of these legislatures would cede to Congress their power of\r\nestablishing banks, saving the charter rights already granted. And this\r\nshould be asked, not by way of amendment to the constitution, because\r\nuntil three-fourths should consent, nothing could be done; but accepted\r\nfrom them one by one, singly, as their consent might be obtained. Any\r\nsingle State, even if no other should come into the measure, would find\r\nits interest in arresting foreign bank paper immediately, and its own\r\nby degrees. Specie would flow in on them as paper disappeared. Their\r\nown banks would call in and pay off their notes gradually, and their\r\nconstituents would thus be saved from the general wreck. Should the\r\ngreater part of the States concede, as is expected, their power over\r\nbanks to Congress, besides insuring their own safety, the paper of the\r\nnon-conceding States might be so checked and circumscribed, by prohibiting\r\nits receipt in any of the conceding States, and even in the non-conceding\r\nas to duties, taxes, judgments, or other demands of the United States,\r\nor of the citizens of other States, that it would soon die of itself,\r\nand the medium of gold and silver be universally restored. This is what\r\nought to be done. But it will not be done. _Carthago non delibitur._\r\nThe overbearing clamor of merchants, speculators, and projectors, will\r\ndrive us before them with our eyes open, until, as in France, under the\r\nMississippi bubble, our citizens will be overtaken by the crush of this\r\nbaseless fabric, without other satisfaction than that of execrations on\r\nthe heads of those functionaries, who, from ignorance, pusillanimity or\r\ncorruption, have betrayed the fruits of their industry into the hands\r\nof projectors and swindlers.\r\n\r\nWhen I speak comparatively of the paper emission of the old Congress\r\nand the present banks, let it not be imagined that I cover them under\r\nthe same mantle. The object of the former was a holy one; for if ever\r\nthere was a holy war, it was that which saved our liberties and gave us\r\nindependence. The object of the latter, is to enrich swindlers at the\r\nexpense of the honest and industrious part of the nation.\r\n\r\nThe sum of what has been said is, that pretermitting the constitutional\r\nquestion on the authority of Congress, and considering this application\r\non the grounds of reason alone, it would be best that our medium should\r\nbe so proportioned to our produce, as to be on a par with that of the\r\ncountries with which we trade, and whose medium is in a sound state; that\r\nspecie is the most perfect medium, because it will preserve its own level;\r\nbecause, having intrinsic and universal value, it can never die in our\r\nhands, and it is the surest resource of reliance in time of war; that\r\nthe trifling economy of paper, as a cheaper medium, or its convenience\r\nfor transmission, weighs nothing in opposition to the advantages of\r\nthe precious metals; that it is liable to be abused, has been, is, and\r\nforever will be abused, in every country in which it is permitted; that\r\nit is already at a term of abuse in these States, which has never been\r\nreached by any other nation, France excepted, whose dreadful catastrophe\r\nshould be a warning against the instrument which produced it; that we\r\nare already at ten or twenty times the due quantity of medium; insomuch,\r\nthat no man knows what his property is now worth, because it is bloating\r\nwhile he is calculating; and still less what it will be worth when the\r\nmedium shall be relieved from its present dropsical state; and that it\r\nis a palpable falsehood to say we can have specie for our paper whenever\r\ndemanded. Instead, then, of yielding to the cries of scarcity of medium\r\nset up by speculators, projectors and commercial gamblers, no endeavors\r\nshould be spared to begin the work of reducing it by such gradual means\r\nas may give time to private fortunes to preserve their poise, and settle\r\ndown with the subsiding medium; and that, for this purpose, the States\r\nshould be urged to concede to the General Government, with a saving of\r\nchartered rights, the exclusive power of establishing banks of discount\r\nfor paper.\r\n\r\nTo the existence of banks of _discount_ for _cash_, as on the continent\r\nof Europe, there can be no objection, because there can be no danger\r\nof abuse, and they are a convenience both to merchants and individuals.\r\nI think they should even be encouraged, by allowing them a larger than\r\nlegal interest on short discounts, and tapering thence, in proportion as\r\nthe term of discount is lengthened, down to legal interest on those of\r\na year or more. Even banks of _deposit_, where cash should be lodged,\r\nand a paper acknowledgment taken out as its representative, entitled\r\nto a return of the cash on demand, would be convenient for remittances,\r\ntravelling persons, &c. But, liable as its cash would be to be pilfered\r\nand robbed, and its paper to be fraudulently re-issued, or issued without\r\ndeposit, it would require skilful and strict regulation. This would\r\ndiffer from the bank of Amsterdam, in the circumstance that the cash\r\ncould be redeemed on returning the note.\r\n\r\nWhen I commenced this letter to you, my dear Sir, on Mr. Law's memorial,\r\nI expected a short one would have answered that. But as I advanced, the\r\nsubject branched itself before me into so many collateral questions, that\r\neven the rapid views I have taken of each have swelled the volume of my\r\nletter beyond my expectations, and, I fear, beyond your patience. Yet\r\non a revisal of it, I find no part which has not so much bearing on the\r\nsubject as to be worth merely the time of perusal. I leave it then as\r\nit is; and will add only the assurances of my constant and affectionate\r\nesteem and respect.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [6] The real cash or money necessary to carry on the circulation\r\n    and barter of a State, is nearly one-third part of all the annual\r\n    rents of the proprietors of the said State; that is, one-ninth\r\n    of the whole produce of the land. Sir William Petty supposes\r\n    one-tenth part of the value of the whole produce sufficient.\r\n    Postlethwait, voce, Cash.\r\n\r\n    [7] Within five months after this, they were compelled by the\r\n    necessities of the war, to abandon the idea of emitting only\r\n    an adequate circulation, and to make those necessities the sole\r\n    measure of their emissions.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN JACOB ASTOR, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                              MONTICELLO, November 9, 1813.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of October 18th has been duly received, and I learn\r\nwith great pleasure the progress you have made towards an establishment\r\non Columbia river. I view it as the germ of a great, free and independent\r\nempire on that side of our continent, and that liberty and self-government\r\nspreading from that as well as this side, will ensure their complete\r\nestablishment over the whole. It must be still more gratifying to yourself\r\nto foresee that your name will be handed down with that of Columbus\r\nand Raleigh, as the father of the establishment and founder of such an\r\nempire. It would be an afflicting thing indeed, should the English be\r\nable to break up the settlement. Their bigotry to the bastard liberty\r\nof their own country, and habitual hostility to every degree of freedom\r\nin any other, will induce the attempt; they would not lose the sale of\r\na bale of furs for the freedom of the whole world. But I hope your party\r\nwill be able to maintain themselves. If they have assiduously cultivated\r\nthe interests and affections of the natives, these will enable them to\r\ndefend themselves against the English, and furnish them an asylum even\r\nif their fort be lost. I hope, and have no doubt our government will\r\ndo for its success whatever they have power to do, and especially that\r\nat the negotiations for peace, they will provide, by convention with\r\nthe English, for the safety and independence of that country, and an\r\nacknowledgment of our right of patronizing them in all cases of injury\r\nfrom foreign nations. But no patronage or protection from this quarter\r\ncan secure the settlement if it does not cherish the affections of the\r\nnatives and make it their interest to uphold it. While you are doing\r\nso much for future generations of men, I sincerely wish you may find a\r\npresent account in the just profits you are entitled to expect from the\r\nenterprise. I will ask of the President permission to read Mr. Stuart's\r\njournal. With fervent wishes for a happy issue to this great undertaking,\r\nwhich promises to form a remarkable epoch in the history of mankind, I\r\ntender you the assurance of my great esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS TO THOMAS JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n                                                 QUINCY, November 12, 1813.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--As I owe you more for your letters of October 12th and 28th\r\nthan I shall be able to pay, I shall begin with the P. S. to the last.\r\n\r\nI am very sorry to say that I cannot assist your memory in the inquiries\r\nof your letter of August 22d. I really know not who was the compositor of\r\nany one of the petitions or addresses you enumerate. Nay, further: I am\r\ncertain I never did know. I was so shallow a politician that I was not\r\naware of the importance of those compositions. They all appeared to me,\r\nin the circumstances of the country, like children's play at marbles or\r\npush-pin, or like misses in their teens, emulating each other in their\r\npearls, their bracelets, their diamond pins and Brussels lace.\r\n\r\nIn the Congress of 1774, there was not one member, except Patrick Henry,\r\nwho appeared to me sensible of the precipice, or rather the pinnacle on\r\nwhich we stood, and had candor and courage enough to acknowledge it.\r\nAmerica is in total ignorance, or under infinite deception concerning\r\nthat assembly. To draw the characters of them all would require a volume,\r\nand would now be considered as a characatured print. One-third Tories,\r\nanother Whigs, and the rest Mongrels.\r\n\r\nThere was a little aristocracy among us of talents and letters. Mr.\r\nDickinson was _primus interpares_, the bell-weather, the leader of the\r\naristocratical flock.\r\n\r\nBilly, _alias_ Governor Livingston, and his son-in-law, Mr. Jay, were of\r\nthe privileged order. The credit of most if not all those compositions,\r\nwas often if not generally given to one or the other of these choice\r\nspirits. Mr. Dickinson, however, was not on any of the original\r\ncommittees. He came not into Congress till October 17th. He was not\r\nappointed till the 15th by his assembly.\r\n\r\nVol. 1, 30. Congress adjourned October 27th, though our correct secretary\r\nhas not recorded any final adjournment or dissolution. Mr. Dickinson\r\nwas in Congress but ten days. The business was all prepared, arranged,\r\nand even in a manner finished before his arrival.\r\n\r\nR. H. Lee was the chairman of the committee for preparing the loyal and\r\ndutiful address to his majesty. Johnson and Henry were acute spirits, and\r\nunderstood the controversy very well, though they had not the advantages\r\nof education like Lee and John Rutledge.\r\n\r\nThe subject had been near a month under discussion in Congress, and most\r\nof the materials thrown out there. It underwent another deliberation\r\nin committee, after which they made the customary compliment to their\r\nchairman, by requesting him to prepare and report a draught, which was\r\ndone, and after examination, correction, amelioration or pejoration,\r\nas usual reported to Congress. October 3d, 4th and 5th were taken up in\r\ndebating and deliberating on matters proper to be contained in the address\r\nto his majesty, vol. 122. October 21st. The address to the king was, after\r\ndebate, re-committed, and Mr. John Dickinson added to the committee. The\r\nfirst draught was made, and all the essential materials put together by\r\nLee. It might be embellished and seasoned afterwards with some of Mr.\r\nDickinson's piety, but I know not that it was. Neat and handsome as the\r\ncomposition is, having never had any confidence in the utility of it, I\r\nnever have thought much about it since it was adopted. Indeed, I never\r\nbestowed much attention on any of those addresses which were all but\r\nrepetitions of the same things, the same facts and arguments, dress and\r\nornament rather than body, soul or substance. My thoughts and cares were\r\nnearly monopolized by the theory of our rights and wrongs, by measures\r\nfor the defence of the country, and the means of governing ourselves. I\r\nwas in a great error, no doubt, and am ashamed to confess it; for those\r\nthings were necessary to give popularity to our cause both at home and\r\nabroad. And to show my stupidity in a stronger light, the reputation\r\nof any one of those compositions has been a more splendid distinction\r\nthan any aristocratical star or garter in the escutcheon of every man\r\nwho has enjoyed it. Very sorry that I cannot give you more satisfactory\r\ninformation, and more so that I cannot at present give more attention\r\nto your two last excellent letters. I am, as usual, affectionately yours.\r\n\r\nN. B. I am almost ready to believe that John Taylor, of Caroline, or of\r\nHazlewood, Port Royal, Virginia, is the author of 630 pages of printed\r\noctavo upon my books that I have received. The style answers every\r\ncharacteristic that you have intimated. Within a week I have received and\r\nlooked into his Arator. They must spring from the same brain, as Minerva\r\nissued from the head of Jove, or rather as Venus rose from the froth of\r\nthe sea. There is, however, a great deal of good sense in Arator, and\r\nthere is some in his Aristocracy.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS TO THOMAS JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n                                                 QUINCY, November 15, 1813.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Accept my thanks for the comprehensive syllabus in your favor\r\nof October 12th.\r\n\r\nThe Psalms of David, in sublimity, beauty, pathos and originality, or,\r\nin one word, in poetry, are superior to all the odes, hymns and songs\r\nin our language. But I had rather read them in our prose translation,\r\nthan in any version I have seen. His morality, however, often shocks\r\nme, like Tristram Shandy's execrations.\r\n\r\nBlacklock's translation of Horace's \"Justum,\" is admirable; superior\r\nto Addison's. Could David be translated as well, his superiority would\r\nbe universally acknowledged. We cannot compare the sublime poetry.\r\nBy Virgil's \"Pollio,\" we may conjecture there was prophecy as well as\r\nsublimity. Why have those verses been annihilated? I suspect Platonic\r\nChristianity, Pharisaical Judaism or Machiavilian politics, in this\r\ncase, as in all other cases, of the destruction of records and literary\r\nmonuments,\r\n\r\n    The auri sacra fames, et dominandi sæva cupido.\r\n\r\nAmong all your researches in Hebrew history and controversy, have you ever\r\nmet a book the design of which is to prove that the ten commandments, as\r\nwe have them in our Catechisms and hung up in our churches, were not the\r\nten commandments written by the finger of God upon tables delivered to\r\nMoses on Mount Sinai, and broken by him in a passion with Aaron for his\r\ngolden calf, nor those afterwards engraved by him on tables of stone;\r\nbut a very different set of commandments?\r\n\r\nThere is such a book, by J. W. Goethen, Schriften, Berlin 1775-1779. I\r\nwish to see this book. You will perceive the question in Exodus, 20: 1,\r\n17, 22, 28, chapter 24: 3, &c.; chapter 24: 12; chapter 25: 31; chapter\r\n31: 18; chapter 31: 19; chapter 34: 1; chapter 34: 10, &c.\r\n\r\nI will make a covenant with all this people. Observe that which I command\r\nthis day:\r\n\r\n1. Thou shalt not adore any other God. Therefore take heed not to enter\r\ninto covenant with the inhabitants of the country; neither take for your\r\nsons their daughters in marriage. They would allure thee to the worship\r\nof false Gods. Much less shall you in any place erect images.\r\n\r\n2. The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep. Seven days shalt thou\r\neat unleavened bread, at the time of the month Abib; to remember that\r\nabout that time, I delivered thee from Egypt.\r\n\r\n3. Every first born of the mother is mine; the male of thine herd, be\r\nit stock or flock. But you shall replace the first born of an ass with\r\na sheep. The first born of your sons shall you _redeem_. No man shall\r\nappear before me with empty hands.\r\n\r\n4. Six days shalt thou labor. The seventh day thou shalt rest from\r\nploughing and gathering.\r\n\r\n5. The feast of weeks shalt thou keep with the firstlings of the wheat\r\nharvest; and the feast of harvesting at the end of the year.\r\n\r\n6. Thrice in every year all male persons shall appear before the Lord.\r\nNobody shall invade your country, as long as you obey this command.\r\n\r\n7. Thou shalt not sacrifice the blood of a sacrifice of mine, upon\r\nleavened bread.\r\n\r\n8. The sacrifice of the Passover shall not remain till the next day.\r\n\r\n9. The firstlings of the produce of your land, thou shalt bring to the\r\nhouse of the Lord.\r\n\r\n10. Thou shalt not boil the kid, while it is yet sucking.\r\n\r\nAnd the Lord spake to Moses: Write these words, as after these words I\r\nmade with you and with Israel a covenant.\r\n\r\nI know not whether Goethen translated or abridged from the Hebrew, or\r\nwhether he used any translation, Greek, Latin, or German. But he differs\r\nin form and words somewhat from our version, Exodus 34: 10 to 28. The\r\nsense seems to be the same. The tables were the evidence of the covenant,\r\nby which the Almighty attached the people of Israel to himself. By these\r\nlaws they were separated from all other nations, and were reminded of\r\nthe principal epochs of their history.\r\n\r\nWhen and where originated our ten commandments? The tables and the ark\r\nwere lost. Authentic copies in few, if any hands; the ten Precepts could\r\nnot be observed, and were little remembered.\r\n\r\nIf the book of Deuteronomy was compiled, during or after the Babylonian\r\ncaptivity, from traditions, the error or amendment might come in those.\r\n\r\nBut you must be weary, as I am at present of problems, conjectures,\r\nand paradoxes, concerning Hebrew, Grecian and Christian and all other\r\nantiquities; but while we believe that the _finis bonorum_ will be happy,\r\nwe may leave learned men to their disquisitions and criticisms.\r\n\r\nI admire your employment in selecting the philosophy and divinity of\r\nJesus, and separating it from all mixtures. If I had eyes and nerves\r\nI would go through both Testaments and mark all that I understand. To\r\nexamine the Mishna, Gemara, Cabbala, Jezirah, Sohar, Cosri and Talmud of\r\nthe Hebrews would require the life of Methuselah, and after all his 969\r\nyears would be wasted to very little purpose. The dæmon of hierarchical\r\ndespotism has been at work both with the Mishna and Gemara. In 1238 a\r\nFrench Jew made a discovery to the Pope (Gregory 9th) of the heresies\r\nof the Talmud. The Pope sent thirty-five articles of error to the\r\nArchbishops of France, requiring them to seize the books of the Jews and\r\nburn all that contained any errors. He wrote in the same terms to the\r\nkings of France, England, Arragon, Castile, Leon, Navarre and Portugal.\r\nIn consequence of this order, twenty cartloads of Hebrew books were\r\nburnt in France; and how many times twenty cartloads were destroyed in\r\nthe other kingdoms? The Talmud of Babylon and that of Jerusalem were\r\ncomposed from 120 to 500 years after the destruction of Jerusalem.\r\n\r\nIf Lightfoot derived light from what escaped from Gregory's fury,\r\nin explaining many passages in the New Testament, by comparing the\r\nexpressions of the Mishna with those of the Apostles and Evangelists,\r\nhow many proofs of the corruptions of Christianity might we find in the\r\npassages burnt?\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS TO THOMAS JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n                                                 QUINCY, November 15, 1813.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I cannot appease my melancholy commiseration for our armies\r\nin this furious snow storm, in any way so well as by studying your letter\r\nof Oct. 28.\r\n\r\nWe are now explicitly agreed upon one important point, viz., that there\r\nis a natural aristocracy among men, the grounds of which are virtue and\r\ntalents. You very justly indulge a little merriment upon this solemn\r\nsubject of aristocracy. I often laugh at it too, for there is nothing\r\nin this laughable world more ridiculous than the management of it by\r\nall the nations of the earth; but while we smile, mankind have reason\r\nto say to us, as the frogs said to the boys, what is sport to you,\r\nare wounds and death to us. When I consider the weakness, the folly,\r\nthe pride, the vanity, the selfishness, the artifice, the low craft\r\nand mean cunning, the want of principle, the avarice, the unbounded\r\nambition, the unfeeling cruelty of a majority of those (in all nations)\r\nwho are allowed an aristocratical influence, and, on the other hand,\r\nthe stupidity with which the more numerous multitude not only become\r\ntheir dupes, but even love to be taken in by their tricks, I feel a\r\nstronger disposition to weep at their destiny, than to laugh at their\r\nfolly. But though we have agreed in one point, in words, it is not yet\r\ncertain that we are perfectly agreed in sense. Fashion has introduced\r\nan indeterminate use of the word talents. Education, wealth, strength,\r\nbeauty, stature, birth, marriage, graceful attitudes and motions, gait,\r\nair, complexion, physiognomy, are talents, as well as genius, science, and\r\nlearning. Any one of these talents that in fact commands or influences\r\ntwo votes in society, gives to the man who possesses it the character\r\nof an aristocrat, in my sense of the word. Pick up the first hundred\r\nmen you meet, and make a republic. Every man will have an equal vote;\r\nbut when deliberations and discussions are opened, it will be found\r\nthat twenty-five, by their talents, virtues being equal, will be able\r\nto carry fifty votes. Every one of these twenty-five is an aristocrat\r\nin my sense of the word; whether he obtains his one vote in addition to\r\nhis own, by his birth, fortune, figure, eloquence, science, learning,\r\ncraft, cunning, or even his character for good fellowship, and a _bon\r\nvivant_.\r\n\r\nWhat gave Sir William Wallace his amazing aristocratical superiority? His\r\nstrength. What gave Mrs. Clark her aristocratical influence--to create\r\ngenerals, admirals, and bishops? Her beauty. What gave Pompadour and Du\r\nBarry the power of making cardinals and popes? And I have lived for years\r\nin the hotel de Valentinois, with Franklin, who had as many virtues as\r\nany of them. In the investigation of the meaning of the word \"talents,\"\r\nI could write 630 pages as pertinent as John Taylor's, of Hazlewood;\r\nbut I will select a single example; for female aristocrats are nearly as\r\nformidable as males. A daughter of a green grocer walks the streets in\r\nLondon daily, with a basket of cabbage sprouts, dandelions, and spinage,\r\non her head. She is observed by the painters to have a beautiful face,\r\nan elegant figure, a graceful step, and a _debonair_. They hire her to\r\nsit. She complies, and is painted by forty artists in a circle around\r\nher. The scientific Dr. William Hamilton outbids the painters, sends\r\nher to school for a genteel education, and marries her. This lady not\r\nonly causes the triumphs of the Nile, Copenhagen, and Trafalgar, but\r\nseparates Naples from France, and finally banishes the king and queen\r\nfrom Sicily. Such is the aristocracy of the natural talent of beauty.\r\nMillions of examples might be quoted from history, sacred and profane,\r\nfrom Eve, Hannah, Deborah, Susanna, Abigail, Judith, Ruth, down to Helen,\r\nMrs. de Mainbenor, and Mrs. Fitzherbert. For mercy's sake do not compel\r\nme to look to our chaste States and territories to find women, one of\r\nwhom let go would in the words of Holopherne's guards, deceive the whole\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nThe proverbs of Theognis, like those of Solomon, are observations on\r\nhuman nature, ordinary life, and civil society, with moral reflections on\r\nthe facts. I quoted him as a witness of the fact, that there was as much\r\ndifference in the races of men as in the breeds of sheep, and as a sharp\r\nreprover and censurer of the sordid, mercenary practice of disgracing\r\nbirth by preferring gold to it. Surely no authority can be more expressly\r\nin point to prove the existence of inequalities, not of rights, but of\r\nmoral, intellectual, and physical inequalities in families, descents and\r\ngenerations. If a descent from pious, virtuous, wealthy, literary, or\r\nscientific ancestors, is a letter of recommendation, or introduction in\r\na man's favor, and enables him to influence only one vote in addition\r\nto his own, he is an aristocrat; for a democrat can have but one vote.\r\nAaron Burr has 100,000 votes from the single circumstance of his descent\r\nfrom President Burr and President Edwards.\r\n\r\nYour commentary on the proverbs of Theognis, reminded me of two solemn\r\ncharacters; the one resembling John Bunyan, the other Scarron. The one\r\nJohn Torrey, the other Ben Franklin. Torrey, a poet, an enthusiast, a\r\nsuperstitious bigot, once very gravely asked my brother, whether it\r\nwould not be better for mankind if children were always begotten by\r\nreligious motives only? Would not religion in this sad case have as little\r\nefficacy in encouraging procreation, as it has now in discouraging it?\r\nI should apprehend a decrease of population, even in our country where\r\nit increases so rapidly.\r\n\r\nIn 1775, Franklin made a morning visit at Mrs. Yard's, to Sam Adams\r\nand John. He was unusually loquacious. \"Man, a rational creature!\"\r\nsaid Franklin. \"Come, let us suppose a rational man. Strip him of all\r\nhis appetites, especially his hunger and thirst. He is in his chamber,\r\nengaged in making experiments, or in pursuing some problem. He is highly\r\nentertained. At this moment a servant knocks. 'Sir, dinner is on the\r\ntable.' 'Dinner! pox! pough! but what have you for dinner?' 'Ham and\r\nchickens.' 'Ham, and must I break the chain of my thoughts to go down\r\nand gnaw a morsel of damned hog's arse? Put aside your ham; I will dine\r\nto-morrow.'\" Take away appetite, and the present generation would not\r\nlive a month, and no future generation would ever exist; and thus the\r\nexalted dignity of human nature would be annihilated and lost, and in my\r\nopinion the whole loss would be of no more importance than putting out\r\na candle, quenching a torch, or crushing a fire-fly, _if in this world\r\nwe only have hope_. Your distinction between natural and artificial\r\naristocracy, does not appear to me founded. Birth and wealth are conferred\r\nupon some men as imperiously by nature as genius, strength, or beauty.\r\nThe heir to honors, and riches, and power, has often no more merit in\r\nprocuring these advantages, than he has in obtaining a handsome face,\r\nor an elegant figure. When aristocracies are established by human laws,\r\nand honor, wealth, and power are made hereditary by municipal laws and\r\npolitical institutions, then I acknowledge artificial aristocracy to\r\ncommence; but this never commences till corruption in elections become\r\ndominant and uncontrollable. But this artificial aristocracy can never\r\nlast. The everlasting envies, jealousies, rivalries, and quarrels\r\namong them; their cruel rapacity upon the poor ignorant people, their\r\nfollowers, compel them to set up Cæsar, a demagogue, to be a monarch, a\r\nmaster; _pour mettre chacun à sa place_. Here you have the origin of all\r\nartificial aristocracy, which is the origin of all monarchies. And both\r\nartificial aristocracy and monarchy, and civil, military, political, and\r\nhierarchical despotism, have all grown out of the natural aristocracy\r\nof virtues and talents. We, to be sure, are far remote from this. Many\r\nhundred years must roll away before we shall be corrupted. Our pure,\r\nvirtuous, public-spirited, federative republic will last forever, govern\r\nthe globe, and introduce the perfection of man; his perfectibility being\r\nalready proved by Price, Priestley, Condorcet, Rousseau, Diderot, and\r\nGodwin. Mischief has been done by the Senate of the United States. I have\r\nknown and felt more of this mischief, than Washington, Jefferson, and\r\nMadison, all together. But this has been all caused by the constitutional\r\npower of the Senate, in executive business, which ought to be immediately,\r\ntotally, and essentially abolished. Your distinction between the Αριστοι\r\nand ψευδο αριστοι, will not help the matter. I would trust one as well\r\nas the other with unlimited power. The law wisely refuses an oath as a\r\nwitness in his own case, to the saint as well as the sinner. No romance\r\nwould be more amusing than the history of your Virginian and our New\r\nEngland aristocratical families. Yet even in Rhode Island there has\r\nbeen no clergy, no church, and I had almost said no State, and some\r\npeople say no religion. There has been a constant respect for certain\r\nold families. Fifty-seven or fifty-eight years ago, in company with\r\nColonel, Counsellor, Judge, John Chandler, whom I have quoted before,\r\na newspaper was brought in. The old sage asked me to look for the news\r\nfrom Rhode Island, and see how the elections had gone there. I read the\r\nlist of Wanbous, Watrous, Greens, Whipples, Malboues, &c. \"I expected\r\nas much,\" said the aged gentleman, \"for I have always been of opinion\r\nthat in the most popular governments, the elections will generally go\r\nin favor of the most ancient families.\" To this day, when any of these\r\ntribes--and we may add Ellerys, Channings, Champlins, &c.,--are pleased\r\nto fall in with the popular current, they are sure to carry all before\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nYou suppose a difference of opinion between you and me on the subject of\r\naristocracy. I can find none. I dislike and detest hereditary honors,\r\noffices, emoluments, established by law So do you. I am for excluding\r\nlegal, hereditary distinctions from the United States as long as possible.\r\nSo are you. I only say that mankind have not yet discovered any remedy\r\nagainst irresistible corruption in elections to offices of great power\r\nand profit, but making them hereditary.\r\n\r\nBut will you say our elections are pure? Be it so, upon the whole;\r\nbut do you recollect in history a more corrupt election than that of\r\nAaron Burr to be President, or that of De Witt Clinton last year? By\r\ncorruption here, I mean a sacrifice of every national interest and honor\r\nto private and party objects. I see the same spirit in Virginia that\r\nyou and I see in Rhode Island and the rest of New England. In New York\r\nit is a struggle of family feuds--a feudal aristocracy. Pennsylvania is\r\na contest between German, Irish and old England families. When Germans\r\nand Irish unite they give 30,000 majorities. There is virtually a white\r\nrose and a red rose, a Cæsar and a Pompey, in every State in this Union,\r\nand contests and dissensions will be as lasting. The rivalry of Bourbons\r\nand Noaillises produced the French revolution, and a similar competition\r\nfor consideration and influence exists and prevails in every village\r\nin the world. Where will terminate the _rabies agri_? The continent\r\nwill be scattered over with manors much larger than Livingston's,\r\nVan Rensselaers's, or Philips's; even our Deacon Strong will have a\r\nprincipality among you Southern folk. What inequality of talents will\r\nbe produced by these land jobbers. Where tends the mania of banks? At\r\nmy table in Philadelphia, I once proposed to you to unite in endeavors\r\nto obtain an amendment of the constitution prohibiting to the separate\r\nStates the power of creating banks; but giving Congress authority to\r\nestablish one bank with a branch in each State, the whole limited to\r\nten millions of dollars. Whether this project was wise or unwise, I know\r\nnot, for I had deliberated little on it then, and have never thought it\r\nworth thinking of since. But you spurned the proposition from you with\r\ndisdain. This system of banks, begotten, brooded and hatched by Duer,\r\nRobert and Gouverneur Morris, Hamilton and Washington, I have always\r\nconsidered as a system of national injustice. A sacrifice of public and\r\nprivate interest to a few aristocratical friends and favorites. My scheme\r\ncould have had no such effect. Verres plundered temples, and robbed a\r\nfew rich men, but he never made such ravages among private property in\r\ngeneral, nor swindled so much out of the pockets of the poor, and middle\r\nclass of people, as these banks have done. No people but this would\r\nhave borne the imposition so long. The people of Ireland would not bear\r\nWood's half-pence. What inequalities of talent have been introduced into\r\nthis country by these aristocratical banks! Our Winthrops, Winslows,\r\nBradfords, Saltonstalls, Quinceys, Chandlers, Leonards, Hutchinsons,\r\nOlivers, Sewalls, &c., are precisely in the situation of your Randolphs,\r\nCarters, and Burwells, and Harrisons. Some of them unpopular for the\r\npart they took in the late revolution, but all respected for their names\r\nand connections; and whenever they fell in with the popular sentiments\r\nare preferred _ceteris paribus_, to all others. When I was young the\r\n_summum bonum_ in Massachusetts was to be worth £10,000 sterling, ride\r\nin a chariot, be Colonel of a regiment of militia, and hold a seat in his\r\nMajesty's council. No man's imagination aspired to anything higher beneath\r\nthe skies. But these plumbs, chariots, colonelships, and counsellorships,\r\nare recorded and will never be forgotten. No great accumulations of\r\nland were made by our early settlers. Mr. Baudoin, a French refugee,\r\nmade the first great purchases, and your General Dearborne, born under\r\na fortunate star, is now enjoying a large portion of the aristocratical\r\nsweets of them. As I have no amanuenses but females, and there is so\r\nmuch about generation in this letter that I dare not ask any of them to\r\ncopy it, and I cannot copy it myself, I must beg of you to return it to\r\nme. Your old friend.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ----.\r\n\r\n                                                         November 28, 1813.\r\n\r\nI will not fatigue you, my dear Sir, with long and labored excuses for\r\nhaving been so tardy in writing to you; but I will briefly mention that\r\nthe thousand hostile ships which cover the ocean render attempts to pass\r\nit now very unfrequent, and these concealing their intentions from all\r\nthat they may not be known to the enemy, are gone before heard of in\r\nsuch inland situations as mine. To this, truth must add the torpidity\r\nof age as one of the obstacles to punctual correspondence.\r\n\r\nYour letters of October 21 and November 15, 1811, and August 29, 1813,\r\nwere duly received, and with that of November 15 came the MS. copy of your\r\nwork on Economy. The extraordinary merit of the former volume had led\r\nme to anticipate great satisfaction and edification from the perusal of\r\nthis, and I can say with truth and sincerity that these expectations were\r\ncompletely fulfilled, new principles developed, former ones corrected, or\r\nrendered more perspicuous, present us an interesting science, heretofore\r\nvoluminous and embarrassed, now happily simplified and brought within a\r\nvery moderate compass. After an attentive perusal, which enabled me to\r\nbear testimony to its worth, I took measures for getting it translated\r\nand printed in Philadelphia; the distance from which place prepared me\r\nto expect great and unavoidable delays. But notwithstanding my continual\r\nurgencies these have gone far beyond my calculations. In a letter of\r\nSeptember 26th from the editor, in answer to one of mine, after urging\r\nin excuse the causes of the delay, he expresses his confidence that it\r\nwould be ready by the last of October, and that period being now past,\r\nI am in daily expectation of hearing from him. As I write the present\r\nletter without knowing by what conveyance it may go, I am not without\r\na hope of receiving a copy of the work in time to accompany this. I\r\nshall then be anxious to learn that better health and more encouraging\r\ncircumstances enable you to pursue your plan through the two remaining\r\nbranches of morals and legislation, which executed in the same lucid,\r\nlogical and condensed style, will present such a whole as the age we live\r\nin will not before have received. Should the same motives operate for\r\ntheir first publication here, I am now offered such means, nearer to me,\r\nas promise a more encouraging promptitude in the execution. And certainly\r\nno effort should be spared on my part to ensure to the world such an\r\nacquisition. The MS. of the first work has been carefully recalled and\r\ndeposited with me. That of the second, when done with, shall be equally\r\ntaken care of.\r\n\r\nIf unmerited praise could give pleasure to a candid mind, I should have\r\nbeen highly exalted, in my own opinion, on the occasion of the first\r\nwork. One of the best judges and best men of the age has ascribed it to\r\nmyself; and has for some time been employed in translating it into French.\r\nIt would be a gratification to which you are highly entitled, could I\r\ntranscribe the sheets he has written me in praise, nay in rapture with\r\nthe work; and were I to name the man, you would be sensible there is not\r\nanother whose suffrage would be more encouraging. But the casualties\r\nwhich lie between us would render criminal the naming any one. In a\r\nletter which I am now writing him, I shall set him right as to myself,\r\nand acknowledge my humble station far below the qualifications necessary\r\nfor that work; and shall discourage his perseverance in retranslating\r\ninto French a work the original of which is so correct in its diction\r\nthat not a word can be altered but for the worse; and from a translation,\r\ntoo, where the author's meaning has sometimes been illy understood,\r\nsometimes mistaken, and often expressed in words not the best chosen.\r\nIndeed, when the work, through its translation, becomes more generally\r\nknown here, the high estimation in which it is held by all who become\r\nacquainted with it, encourage me to hope I may get it printed in the\r\noriginal. I sent a copy of it to the late President of William and Mary\r\nCollege of this State, who adopted it at once as the elementary book\r\nof that institution. From these beginnings it will spread and become\r\na political gospel for a nation open to reason, and in a situation to\r\nadopt and profit by its results, without a fear of their leading to wrong.\r\n\r\nI sincerely wish you all the health, comfort and leisure necessary to\r\ndispose and enable you to persevere in employing yourself so useful for\r\npresent and future times, and I pray you to be assured you have not a\r\nmore grateful votary for your benefactions to mankind, nor one of higher\r\nsentiments of esteem and affectionate respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS TO THOMAS JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n                                                  QUINCY, December 3, 1813.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--The proverbs of the old Greek poets are as short and pithy\r\nas any of Solomon or Franklin. Hesiod has several. His Αθανατους μὲν\r\nπρῶτα θεους νομω ως διακειται Τιμα. Honor the gods established by law.\r\nI know not how we can escape martyrdom without a discreet attention to\r\nthis precept. You have suffered, and I have suffered more than you, for\r\nwant of a strict observance of this rule.\r\n\r\nThere is another oracle of this Hesiod, which requires a kind of dance\r\nupon a tight rope and a slack rope too, in philosophy and theology:\r\nΠιστις δ' αρα ομως και απιστια ωλεσαν ανδρας. If believing too little\r\nor too much is so fatal to mankind, what will become of us all?\r\n\r\nIn studying the perfectability of human nature and its progress towards\r\nperfection in this world, on this earth, remember that I have met many\r\ncurious and interesting characters.\r\n\r\nAbout three hundred years ago, there appeared a number of men of letters,\r\nwho appeared to endeavor to believe neither too little nor too much.\r\nThey labored to imitate the Hebrew archers, who could shoot to an hair's\r\nbreadth. The Pope and his church believed too much. Luther and his\r\nchurch believed too little. This little band was headed by three great\r\nscholars: Erasmus, Vives and Badens. This triumvirate is said to have\r\nbeen at the head of the republic of letters in that age. Had Condorcet\r\nbeen master of his subject, I fancy he would have taken more notice, in\r\nhis History of the Progress of Mind, of these characters. Have you their\r\nwritings? I wish I had. I shall confine myself at present to Vives. He\r\nwrote commentaries on the City of God of St. Augustine, some parts of\r\nwhich were censured by the Doctors of the Louvain, as too bold and too\r\nfree. I know not whether the following passage of the learned Spaniard\r\nwas among the sentiments condemned or not:\r\n\r\n\"I have been much afflicted,\" says Vives, \"when I have seriously\r\nconsidered how diligently, and with what exact care, the actions of\r\nAlexander, Hannibal, Scipio, Pompey, Cæsar and other commanders, and the\r\nlives of Socrates, Plato, Aristotle and other philosophers, have been\r\nwritten and fixed in an everlasting remembrance, so that there is not the\r\nleast danger they can ever be lost; but then the acts of the Apostles,\r\nand martyrs and saints of our religion, and of the affairs of the rising\r\nand established church, being involved in much darkness, are almost\r\ntotally unknown, though they are of so much greater advantage than the\r\nlives of the philosophers or great generals, both as to the improvement\r\nof our knowledge and practice. For what is written of these holy men,\r\nexcept a very few things, is very much corrupted and defaced with the\r\nmixture of many fables, while the writer, indulging his own humor, doth\r\nnot tell us what the saint did, but what the historian would have had\r\nhim do. And the fancy of the writer dictates the life and not the truth\r\nof things.\" And again Vives says: \"There have been men who have thought\r\nit a great piece of piety, to invent lies for the sake of religion.\"\r\n\r\nThe great Cardinal Barronius, too, confesses: \"There is nothing which\r\nseems so much neglected to this day, as a true and certain account of\r\nthe affairs of the church, collected with an exact diligence. And that\r\nI may speak of the more ancient, it is very difficult to find any of\r\nthem who have published commentaries on this subject, which have hit\r\nthe truth in all points.\"\r\n\r\nCanus, too, another Spanish prelate of great name, says: \"I speak it\r\nwith grief and not by way of reproach, Laertius has written the lives of\r\nthe philosophers with more ease and industry than the Christians have\r\nthose of the saints. Suetonius has represented the lives of the Cæsars\r\nwith much more truth and sincerity than the Catholics have the affairs\r\n(I will not say of the emperors) but even those of the martyrs, holy\r\nvirgins and confessors. For they have not concealed the vice nor the\r\nvery suspicions of vice, in good and commendable philosophers or princes,\r\nand in the worst of them they discover the very colors or appearances of\r\nvirtue. But the greatest part of our writers either follow the conduct\r\nof their affections, or industriously feign many things; so that I, for\r\nmy part, am very often both weary and ashamed of them, because I know\r\nthat they have thereby brought nothing of advantage to the church of\r\nChrist, but very much inconvenience.\" Vives and Canus are moderns, but\r\nArnobius, the converter of Lætantius, was ancient. He says: \"But neither\r\ncould all that was done be written, or arrive at the knowledge of all\r\nmen--many of our great actions being done by obscure men and those who\r\nhad no knowledge of letters. And if some of them are committed to letters\r\nand writings, yet even here, by the malice of the devils and men like\r\nthem, whose great design and study is to intercept and ruin this truth,\r\nby interpolating or adding some things to them, or by changing or taking\r\nout words, syllables or letters, they have put a stop to the faith of\r\nwise men, and corrupted the truth of things.\"\r\n\r\nIndeed, Mr. Jefferson, what could be invented to debase the ancient\r\nChristianism, which Greeks, Romans, Hebrews and Christian factions,\r\nabove all the Catholics, have not fraudulently imposed upon the public?\r\nMiracles after miracles have rolled down in torrents, wave succeeding\r\nwave in the Catholic church, from the Council of Nice, and long before,\r\nto this day.\r\n\r\nAristotle, no doubt, thought his Ουτε πασι πιστευοντες, ουτε πασιν\r\nαπιστουντες, very wise and very profound; but what is its worth? What man,\r\nwoman or child ever believed everything or nothing? Oh! that Priestley\r\ncould live again, and have leisure and means! An inquirer after truth,\r\nwho had neither time nor means, might request him to search and re-search\r\nfor answers to a few questions:\r\n\r\n1. Have we more than two witnesses of the life of Jesus--Matthew and John?\r\n\r\n2. Have we one witness to the existence of Matthew's gospel in the first\r\ncentury?\r\n\r\n3. Have we one witness of the existence of John's gospel in the first\r\ncentury?\r\n\r\n4. Have we one witness of the existence of Mark's gospel in the first\r\ncentury?\r\n\r\n5. Have we one witness of the existence of Luke's gospel in the first\r\ncentury?\r\n\r\n6. Have we any witness of the existence of St. Thomas' gospel, that is\r\nthe gospel of the infancy in the first century?\r\n\r\n7. Have we any evidence of the existence of the Acts of the Apostles in\r\nthe first century?\r\n\r\n8. Have we any evidence of the existence of the supplement to the Acts\r\nof the Apostles, Peter and Paul, or Paul and Tecle, in the first century?\r\n\r\nHere I was interrupted by a new book, Chateaubriand's Travels in Greece,\r\nPalestine and Egypt, and by a lung fever with which the amiable companion\r\nof my life has been violently and dangerously attacked.\r\n\r\nDecember 13th. I have fifty more questions to put to Priestley, but must\r\nadjourn them to a future opportunity.\r\n\r\nI have read Chateaubriand with as much delight as I ever read Bunyan's\r\nPilgrims' Progress, Robinson Crusoe's Travels, or Gulliver's, or\r\nWhitefield's, or Wesley's Life, or the Life of St. Francis, St.\r\nAnthony, or St. Ignatius Loyola. A work of infinite learning, perfectly\r\nwell written, a magazine of information, but enthusiastic, bigoted,\r\nsuperstitious, Roman Catholic throughout. If I were to indulge in\r\njealous criticism and conjecture, I should suspect that there had been\r\nan Œcuemenical counsel of Popes, Cardinals and Bishops, and that this\r\ntraveller has been employed at their expense to make this tour, to lay\r\na foundation for the resurrection of the Catholic Hierarchy in Europe.\r\n\r\nHave you read La Harpe's Course de Literature, in fifteen volumes? Have\r\nyou read St. Pierre's Studies of Nature?\r\n\r\nI am now reading the controversy between Voltaire and Monotte.\r\n\r\nOur friend Rush has given us for his last legacy, an analysis of some\r\nof the diseases of the mind.\r\n\r\nJohnson said, \"We are all more or less mad;\" and who is or has been more\r\nmad than Johnson?\r\n\r\nI know of no philosopher, or theologian, or moralist, ancient or modern,\r\nmore profound, more infallible than Whitefield, if the anecdote I heard\r\nbe true.\r\n\r\nHe began: \"Father Abraham,\" with his hands and eyes gracefully directed to\r\nthe heavens, as I have more than once seen him; \"Father Abraham, who have\r\nyou there with you? Have you Catholics?\" \"No.\" \"Have you Protestants?\"\r\n\"No.\" \"Have you Churchmen?\" \"No.\" \"Have you Dissenters?\" \"No.\" \"Have you\r\nPresbyterians?\" \"No.\" \"Quakers?\" \"No.\" \"Anabaptists?\" \"No.\" \"Who have\r\nyou there? Are you alone?\" \"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"My brethren, you have the answer to all these questions in the words\r\nof my text: 'He who feareth God and worketh righteousness, shall be\r\naccepted of Him.'\"\r\n\r\nAllegiance to the Creator and Governor of the Milky-Way, and the Nebulæ,\r\nand benevolence to all his creatures, is my Religion.\r\n\r\n     Si quid novisti rectius istis, candidus imperti.\r\n\r\nI am as ever.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO BARON DE HUMBOLDT.\r\n\r\n                                                          December 6, 1813.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR FRIEND AND BARON,--I have to acknowledge your two letters of\r\nDecember 20 and 26, 1811, by Mr. Correa, and am first to thank you for\r\nmaking me acquainted with that most excellent character. He was so kind\r\nas to visit me at Monticello, and I found him one of the most learned\r\nand amiable of men. It was a subject of deep regret to separate from so\r\nmuch worth in the moment of its becoming known to us.\r\n\r\nThe livraison of your astronomical observations, and the 6th and 7th\r\non the subject of New Spain, with the corresponding atlasses, are duly\r\nreceived, as had been the preceding cahiers. For these treasures of a\r\nlearning so interesting to us, accept my sincere thanks. I think it most\r\nfortunate that your travels in those countries were so timed as to make\r\nthem known to the world in the moment they were about to become actors on\r\nits stage. That they will throw off their European dependence I have no\r\ndoubt; but in what kind of government their revolution will end I am not\r\nso certain. History, I believe, furnishes no example of a priest-ridden\r\npeople maintaining a free civil government. This marks the lowest grade of\r\nignorance, of which their civil as well as religious leaders will always\r\navail themselves for their own purposes. The vicinity of New Spain to\r\nthe United States, and their consequent intercourse, may furnish schools\r\nfor the higher, and example for the lower classes of their citizens. And\r\nMexico, where we learn from you that men of science are not wanting, may\r\nrevolutionize itself under better auspices than the Southern provinces.\r\nThese last, I fear, must end in military despotisms. The different casts\r\nof their inhabitants, their mutual hatreds and jealousies, their profound\r\nignorance and bigotry, will be played off by cunning leaders, and each\r\nbe made the instrument of enslaving the others. But of all this you can\r\nbest judge, for in truth we have little knowledge of them to be depended\r\non, but through you. But in whatever governments they end they will be\r\n_American_ governments, no longer to be involved in the never-ceasing\r\nbroils of Europe. The European nations constitute a separate division\r\nof the globe; their localities make them part of a distinct system;\r\nthey have a set of interests of their own in which it is our business\r\nnever to engage ourselves. America has a hemisphere to itself. It must\r\nhave its separate system of interests, which must not be subordinated\r\nto those of Europe. The insulated state in which nature has placed the\r\nAmerican continent, should so far avail it that no spark of war kindled\r\nin the other quarters of the globe should be wafted across the wide\r\noceans which separate us from them. And it will be so. In fifty years\r\nmore the United States alone will contain fifty millions of inhabitants,\r\nand fifty years are soon gone over. The peace of 1763 is within that\r\nperiod. I was then twenty years old, and of course remember well all\r\nthe transactions of the war preceding it. And you will live to see the\r\nepoch now equally ahead of us; and the numbers which will then be spread\r\nover the other parts of the American hemisphere, catching long before\r\nthat the principles of our portion of it, and concurring with us in the\r\nmaintenance of the same system. You see how readily we run into ages\r\nbeyond the grave; and even those of us to whom that grave is already\r\nopening its quiet bosom. I am anticipating events of which you will be\r\nthe bearer to me in the Elysian fields fifty years hence.\r\n\r\nYou know, my friend, the benevolent plan we were pursuing here for the\r\nhappiness of the aboriginal inhabitants in our vicinities. We spared\r\nnothing to keep them at peace with one another. To teach them agriculture\r\nand the rudiments of the most necessary arts, and to encourage industry\r\nby establishing among them separate property. In this way they would\r\nhave been enabled to subsist and multiply on a moderate scale of landed\r\npossession. They would have mixed their blood with ours, and been\r\namalgamated and identified with us within no distant period of time. On\r\nthe commencement of our present war, we pressed on them the observance\r\nof peace and neutrality, but the interested and unprincipled policy of\r\nEngland has defeated all our labors for the salvation of these unfortunate\r\npeople. They have seduced the greater part of the tribes within our\r\nneighborhood, to take up the hatchet against us, and the cruel massacres\r\nthey have committed on the women and children of our frontiers taken by\r\nsurprise, will oblige us now to pursue them to extermination, or drive\r\nthem to new seats beyond our reach. Already we have driven their patrons\r\nand seducers into Montreal, and the opening season will force them to\r\ntheir last refuge, the walls of Quebec. We have cut off all possibility\r\nof intercourse and of mutual aid, and may pursue at our leisure whatever\r\nplan we find necessary to secure ourselves against the future effects\r\nof their savage and ruthless warfare. The confirmed brutalization, if\r\nnot the extermination of this race in our America, is therefore to form\r\nan additional chapter in the English history of the same colored man in\r\nAsia, and of the brethren of their own color in Ireland, and wherever else\r\nAnglo-mercantile cupidity can find a two-penny interest in deluging the\r\nearth with human blood. But let us turn from the loathsome contemplation\r\nof the degrading effects of commercial avarice.\r\n\r\nThat their Arrowsmith should have stolen your Map of Mexico, was in the\r\npiratical spirit of his country. But I should be sincerely sorry if our\r\nPike has made an ungenerous use of your candid communications here; and\r\nthe more so as he died in the arms of victory gained over the enemies of\r\nhis country. Whatever he did was on a principle of enlarging knowledge,\r\nand not for filthy shillings and pence of which he made none from that\r\nwork. If what he has borrowed has any effect it will be to excite an\r\nappeal in his readers from his defective information to the copious\r\nvolumes of it with which you have enriched the world. I am sorry he\r\nomitted even to acknowledge the source of his information. It has been\r\nan oversight, and not at all in the spirit of his generous nature. Let\r\nme solicit your forgiveness then of a deceased hero, of an honest and\r\nzealous patriot, who lived and died for his country.\r\n\r\nYou will find it inconceivable that Lewis's journey to the Pacific should\r\nnot yet have appeared; nor is it in my power to tell you the reason. The\r\nmeasures taken by his surviving companion, Clarke, for the publication,\r\nhave not answered our wishes in point of despatch. I think, however,\r\nfrom what I have heard, that the mere journal will be out within a\r\nfew weeks in two volumes 8vo. These I will take care to send you with\r\nthe tobacco seed you desired, if it be possible for them to escape the\r\nthousand ships of our enemies spread over the ocean. The botanical and\r\nzoological discoveries of Lewis will probably experience greater delay,\r\nand become known to the world through other channels before that volume\r\nwill be ready. The Atlas, I believe, waits on the leisure of the engraver.\r\n\r\nAlthough I do not know whether you are now at Paris or ranging the\r\nregions of Asia to acquire more knowledge for the use of men, I cannot\r\ndeny myself the gratification of an endeavor to recall myself to your\r\nrecollection, and of assuring you of my constant attachment, and of\r\nrenewing to you the just tribute of my affectionate esteem and high\r\nrespect and consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MADAM DE TESSÉ.\r\n\r\n                                                          December 8, 1813.\r\n\r\nWhile at war, my dear Madam and friend, with the leviathan of the ocean,\r\nthere is little hope of a letter escaping his thousand ships; yet I cannot\r\npermit myself longer to withhold the acknowledgment of your letter of\r\nJune 28 of the last year, with which came the memoirs of the Margrave of\r\nBareuth. I am much indebted to you for this singular morsel of history\r\nwhich has given us a certain view of kings, queens and princes, disrobed\r\nof their formalities. It is a peep into the state of the Egyptian god\r\nApis. It would not be easy to find grosser manners, coarser vices, or\r\nmore meanness in the poorest huts of our peasantry. The princess shows\r\nherself the legitimate sister of Frederic, cynical, selfish, and without\r\na heart. Notwithstanding your wars with England, I presume you get the\r\npublications of that country. The memoirs of Mrs. Clarke and of her\r\n_darling_ prince, and the book, emphatically so called, because it is\r\nthe Biblia Sacra Deorum et Dearum sub-cœlestium, the Prince Regent, his\r\nPrincess and the minor deities of his sphere, form a worthy sequel to the\r\nmemoirs of Bareuth; instead of the vulgarity and penury of the court of\r\nBerlin, giving us the vulgarity and profusion of that of London, and the\r\ngross stupidity and profligacy of the latter, in lieu of the genius and\r\nmisanthropism of the former. The whole might be published as a supplement\r\nto M. de Buffon, under the title of the \"Natural History of Kings and\r\nPrinces,\" or as a separate work and called \"Medicine for Monarchists.\"\r\nThe \"Intercepted Letters,\" a later English publication of great wit\r\nand humor, has put them to their proper use by holding them up as butts\r\nfor the ridicule and contempt of mankind. Yet by such worthless beings\r\nis a great nation to be governed and even made to deify their old king\r\nbecause he is only a fool and a maniac, and to forgive and forget his\r\nhaving lost to them a great and flourishing empire, added nine hundred\r\nmillions sterling to their debt, for which the fee simple of the whole\r\nisland would not sell, if offered farm by farm at public auction, and\r\nincreased their annual taxes from eight to seventy millions sterling,\r\nmore than the whole rent-roll of the island. What must be the dreary\r\nprospect from the son when such a father is deplored as a national loss.\r\nBut let us drop these odious beings and pass to those of an higher order,\r\nthe plants of the field. I am afraid I have given you a great deal more\r\ntrouble than I intended by my enquiries for the Maronnier or Castanea\r\nSaliva, of which I wished to possess my own country, without knowing how\r\nrare its culture was even in yours. The two plants which your researches\r\nhave placed in your own garden, it will be all but impossible to remove\r\nhither. The war renders their safe passage across the Atlantic extremely\r\nprecarious, and, if landed anywhere but in the Chesapeake, the risk of\r\nthe additional voyage along the coast to Virginia, is still greater.\r\nUnder these circumstances it is better they should retain their present\r\nstation, and compensate to you the trouble they have cost you.\r\n\r\nI learn with great pleasure the success of your new gardens at Auenay.\r\nNo occupation can be more delightful or useful. They will have the merit\r\nof inducing you to forget those of Chaville. With the botanical riches\r\nwhich you mention to have been derived to England from New Holland, we\r\nare as yet unacquainted. Lewis's journey across our continent to the\r\nPacific has added a number of new plants to our former stock. Some of\r\nthem are curious, some ornamental, some useful, and some may by culture\r\nbe made acceptable on our tables. I have growing, which I destine for\r\nyou, a very handsome little shrub of the size of a currant bush. Its\r\nbeauty consists in a great produce of berries of the size of currants, and\r\nliterally as white as snow, which remain on the bush through the winter,\r\nafter its leaves have fallen, and make it an object as singular as it is\r\nbeautiful. We call it the snow-berry bush, no botanical name being yet\r\ngiven to it, but I do not know why we might not call it Chionicoccos, or\r\nKallicoccos. All Lewis's plants are growing in the garden of Mr. McMahon,\r\na gardener of Philadelphia, to whom I consigned them, and from whom I\r\nshall have great pleasure, when peace is restored, in ordering for you\r\nany of these or of our other indigenous plants. The port of Philadelphia\r\nhas great intercourse with Bordeaux and Nantes, and some little perhaps\r\nwith Havre. I was mortified not long since by receiving a letter from\r\na merchant in Bordeaux, apologizing for having suffered a box of plants\r\naddressed by me to you, to get accidentally covered in his warehouse by\r\nother objects, and to remain three years undiscovered, when every thing\r\nin it was found to be rotten. I have learned occasionally that others\r\nrotted in the ware-houses of the English pirates. We are now settling\r\nthat account with them. We have taken their Upper Canada and shall add\r\nthe Lower to it when the season will admit; and hope to remove them fully\r\nand finally from our continent. And what they will feel more, for they\r\nvalue their colonies only for the bales of cloth they take from them,\r\nwe have established manufactures, not only sufficient to supersede our\r\ndemand from them, but to rivalize them in foreign markets. But for the\r\ncourse of our war I will refer you to M. de La Fayette, to whom I state\r\nit more particularly.\r\n\r\nOur friend Mr. Short is well. He makes Philadelphia his winter quarters,\r\nand New York, or the country, those of the summer. In his fortune he\r\nis perfectly independent and at ease, and does not trouble himself with\r\nthe party politics of our country. Will you permit me to place here for\r\nM. de Tessé the testimony of my high esteem and respect, and accept\r\nfor yourself an assurance of the warm recollections I retain of your\r\nmany civilities and courtesies to me, and the homage of my constant and\r\naffectionate attachment and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DON VALENTIN DE TORONDA CORUNA.\r\n\r\n                                             MONTICELLO, December 14, 1813.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have had the pleasure of receiving several letters from\r\nyou, covering printed propositions and pamphlets on the state of your\r\naffairs, and all breathing the genuine sentiments of order, liberty and\r\nphilanthropy, with which I know you to be sincerely inspired. We learn\r\nlittle to be depended on here as to your civil proceedings, or of the\r\ndivision of sentiments among you; but in this absence of information\r\nI have made whatever you propose the polar star of my wishes. What is\r\nto be the issue of your present struggles we here cannot judge. But we\r\nsincerely wish it may be what is best for the happiness and reinvigoration\r\nof your country. That its divorce from its American colonies, which\r\nis now unavoidable, will be a great blessing, it is impossible not to\r\npronounce on a review of what Spain was when she acquired them, and of\r\nher gradual descent from that proud eminence to the condition in which\r\nher present war found her. Nature has formed that peninsula to be the\r\nsecond, and why not the first nation in Europe? Give equal habits of\r\nenergy to the bodies, and of science to the minds of her citizens, and\r\nwhere could her superior be found? The most advantageous relation in\r\nwhich she can stand with her American colonies is that of independent\r\nfriendship, secured by the ties of consanguinity, sameness of language,\r\nreligion, manners, and habits, and certain from the influence of these,\r\nof a preference in her commerce, if, instead of the eternal irritations,\r\nthwartings, machinations against their new governments, the insults and\r\naggressions which Great Britain has so unwisely practised towards us,\r\nto force us to hate her against our natural inclinations, Spain yields,\r\nlike a genuine parent, to the forisfamiliation of her colonies, now at\r\nmaturity, if she extends to them her affections, her aid, her patronage\r\nin every court and country, it will weave a bond of union indissoluble\r\nby time. We are in a state of semi-warfare with your adjoining colonies,\r\nthe Floridas. We do not consider this as affecting our peace with Spain\r\nor any other of her former possessions. We wish her and them well;\r\nand under her present difficulties at home, and her doubtful future\r\nrelations with her colonies, both wisdom and interest will, I presume,\r\ninduce her to leave them to settle themselves the quarrels they draw\r\non themselves from their neighbors. The commanding officers in the\r\nFloridas have excited and armed the neighboring savages to war against\r\nus, and to murder and scalp many of our women and children as well as\r\nmen, taken by surprise--poor creatures! They have paid for it with the\r\nloss of the flower of their strength, and have given us the right, as\r\nwe possess the power, to exterminate or to expatriate them beyond the\r\nMississippi. This conduct of the Spanish officers will probably oblige\r\nus to take possession of the Floridas, and the rather as we believe the\r\nEnglish will otherwise seize them, and use them as stations to distract\r\nand annoy us. But should we possess ourselves of them, and Spain retain\r\nher other colonies in this hemisphere, I presume we shall consider them\r\nin our hands as subjects of negociation.\r\n\r\nWe are now at the close of our second campaign with England. During the\r\nfirst we suffered several checks, from the want of capable and tried\r\nofficers; all the higher ones of the Revolution having died off during an\r\ninterval of thirty years of peace. But this second campaign has been more\r\nsuccessful, having given us all the lakes and country of Upper Canada,\r\nexcept the single post of Kingston, at its lower extremity. The two\r\nimmediate causes of the war were the Orders of Council, and impressment\r\nof our seamen. The first having been removed after we had declared war,\r\nthe war is continued for the second; and a third has been generated by\r\ntheir conduct during the war, in exciting the Indian hordes to murder\r\nand scalp the women and children on our frontier. This renders peace for\r\never impossible but on the establishment of such a meridian boundary to\r\ntheir possessions, as that they never more can have such influence with\r\nthe savages as to excite again the same barbarities. The thousand ships,\r\ntoo, they took from us in peace, and the six thousand seamen impressed,\r\ncall for this indemnification. On the water we have proved to the world\r\nthe error of their invincibility, and shown that with equal force and\r\nwell-trained officers, they can be beaten by other nations as brave as\r\nthemselves. Their lying officers and printers will give to Europe very\r\ndifferent views of the state of their war with us. But you will see now,\r\nas in the Revolutionary war, that they will lie, and conquer themselves\r\nout of all their possessions on this continent.\r\n\r\nI pray for the happiness of your nation, and that it may be blessed with\r\nsound views and successful measures, under the difficulties in which\r\nit is involved; and especially that they may know the value of your\r\ncounsels, and to yourself I tender the assurances of my high respect\r\nand esteem.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS TO THOMAS JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n                                                 QUINCY, December 25, 1813.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Answer my letters at your leisure. Give yourself no concern.\r\nI write as for a refuge and protection against _ennui_.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental principle of all philosophy and all christianity, is\r\n\"_Rejoice always in all things!_\" \"Be thankful at all times for all\r\ngood, and all that we call evil.\" Will it not follow that I ought to\r\nrejoice and be thankful that Priestley has lived? That Gibbon has lived?\r\nThat Hume has lived, though a conceited Scotchman? That Bolingbroke has\r\nlived, though a haughty, arrogant, supercilious dogmatist? That Burke\r\nand Johnson have lived, though superstitious slaves, or self-deceiving\r\nhypocrites, both? Is it not laughable to hear Burke call Bolingbroke a\r\nsuperficial writer? To hear him ask: \"Who ever read him through?\" Had\r\nI been present, I would have answered him, \"I, I myself, I have read\r\nhim through more than fifty years ago, and more than five times in my\r\nlife, and once within five years past. And in my opinion, the epithet\r\n'superficial,' belongs to you and your friend Johnson more than to him.\"\r\n\r\nI might say much more. But I believe Burke and Johnson to have been as\r\npolitical christians as Leo Tenth.\r\n\r\nI return to Priestley, though I have great complaints against him for\r\npersonal injuries and persecution, at the same time that I forgive it\r\nall, and hope and pray that he may be pardoned for it all above.\r\n\r\nDr. Brocklesby, an intimate friend and convivial companion of Johnson,\r\ntold me that Johnson died in agonies of horror of annihilation; and all\r\nthe accounts we have of his death, corroborate this account of Brocklesby.\r\nDread of annihilation! Dread of nothing! A dread of nothing, I should\r\nthink, would be no dread at all. Can there be any real, substantial,\r\nrational fear of nothing? Were you on your death-bed, and in your last\r\nmoments informed by demonstration of revelation, that you would cease\r\nto think and to feel, at your dissolution, should you be terrified?\r\nYou might be ashamed of yourself for having lived so long to bear the\r\nproud man's contumely. You might be ashamed of your Maker, and compare\r\nhim to a little girl, amusing herself, her brothers and sisters, by\r\nblowing bubbles in soap-suds. You might compare him to boys sporting\r\nwith crackers and rockets, or to men employed in making mere artificial\r\nfire-works, or to men and women at fairs and operas, or Sadler's Wells'\r\nexploits, or to politicians in their intrigues, or to heroes in their\r\nbutcheries, or to Popes in their devilisms. But what should you fear?\r\nNothing. _Emori nolo, sed me mortuum esse nihil estimo._\r\n\r\nTo return to Priestley. You could make a more luminous book than his,\r\nupon the doctrines of heathen philosophers compared with those of\r\nrevelation. Why has he not given us a more satisfactory account of the\r\nPythagorean Philosophy and Theology? He barely names Œileus, who lived\r\nlong before Plato. His treatise of kings and monarchy has been destroyed,\r\nI conjecture, by Platonic Philosophers, Platonic Jews or Christians,\r\nor by fraudulent republicans or despots. His treatise of the universe\r\nhas been preserved. He labors to prove the eternity of the world. The\r\nMarquis D'Argens translated it, in all its noble simplicity. The Abbé\r\nBatteaux has since given another translation. D'Argens not only explains\r\nthe text, but sheds more light upon the ancient systems. His remarks are\r\nso many treatises, which develop the concatenation of ancient opinions.\r\nThe most essential ideas of the theology, of the physics, and of the\r\nmorality of the ancients are clearly explained, and their different\r\ndoctrines compared with one another and with the modern discoveries. I\r\nwish I owned this book and one hundred thousand more that I want every\r\nday, now when I am almost incapable of making any use of them. No doubt\r\nhe informs us that Pythagoras was a great traveller. Priestley barely\r\nmentions Timæus, but it does not appear that he had read him. Why has\r\nhe not given us an account of him and his book? He was before Plato,\r\nand gave him the idea of his Timæus, and much more of his philosophy.\r\n\r\nAfter his master, he maintained the existence of matter; that matter was\r\ncapable of receiving all sorts of forms; that a moving power agitated\r\nall the parts of it, and that an intelligence produced a regular and\r\nharmonious world. This intelligence had seen a plan, an _idea_ (Logos)\r\nin conformity to which it wrought, and without which it would not have\r\nknown what it was about, nor what it wanted to do. This plan was the\r\n_idea_, image or model which had represented to the Supreme Intelligence\r\nthe world before it existed, which had directed it in its action upon\r\nthe moving power, and which it contemplated in forming the elements, the\r\nbodies and the world. This model was distinguished from the intelligence\r\nwhich produced the world, as the architect is from his plans. He divided\r\nthe productive cause of the world into a spirit which directed the\r\nmoving force, and into an image which determined it in the choice of\r\nthe directions which it gave to the moving force, and the forms which\r\nit gave to matter. I wonder that Priestley has overlooked this, because\r\nit is the same philosophy with Plato's, and would have shown that the\r\nPythagorean as well as the Platonic philosophers probably concurred in\r\nthe fabrication of the Christian Trinity. Priestley mentions the name of\r\nAchylas, but does not appear to have read him, though he was a successor\r\nof Pythagoras, and a great mathematician, a great statesman and a great\r\ngeneral. John Gram, a learned and honorable Dane, has given a handsome\r\nedition of his works, with a Latin translation and an ample account of his\r\nlife and writings. Seleucus, the Legislator of Locris, and Charondas, of\r\nSybaris, were disciples of Pythagoras, and both celebrated to immortality\r\nfor the wisdom of their laws, five hundred years before Christ. Why are\r\nthose laws lost? I say _the spirit of party_ has destroyed them; civil,\r\npolitical and ecclesiastical bigotry.\r\n\r\nDespotical, monarchical, aristocratical and democratical fury have all\r\nbeen employed in this work of destruction of everything that could give\r\nus true light, and a clear insight of antiquity. For every one of these\r\nparties, when possessed of power, or when they have been undermost, and\r\nstruggling to get uppermost, has been equally prone to every species of\r\nfraud and violence and usurpation.\r\n\r\nWhy has not Priestley mentioned these Legislators? The preamble to the\r\nlaws of Zaleucus, which is all that remains, is as orthodox christian\r\ntheology as Priestley's, and christian benevolence and forgiveness of\r\ninjuries almost as clearly expressed.\r\n\r\nPriestley ought to have done impartial justice to philosophy and\r\nphilosophers. Philosophy, which is the result of reason, is the first,\r\nthe original revelation of the Creator to his creature, man. When this\r\nrevelation is clear and certain by intuition or necessary induction, no\r\nsubsequent revelation supported by prophecies or miracles can supersede\r\nit. Philosophy is not only the love of wisdom, but the science of the\r\nuniverse and its cause.\r\n\r\nThere is, there was, and there will be but one master of philosophy\r\nin the universe. Portions of it, in different degrees, are revealed to\r\ncreatures.\r\n\r\nPhilosophy looks with an impartial eye on all terrestrial religions. I\r\nhave examined all, as well as my narrow sphere, my straightened means\r\nand my busy life would allow me, and the result is, that the Bible is\r\nthe best book in the world. It contains more of my little philosophy\r\nthan all the libraries I have seen; and such parts of it as I cannot\r\nreconcile to my little philosophy, I postpone for future investigation.\r\n\r\nPriestley ought to have given us a sketch of the religion and morals\r\nof Zoroaster, of Sanchoniathon, of Confucius, and all the founders of\r\nreligions before Christ, whose superiority would, from such a comparison,\r\nhave appeared the more transcendent.\r\n\r\nPriestley ought to have told us that Pythagoras passed twenty years in\r\nhis travels in India, in Egypt, in Chaldea, perhaps in Sodom and Gomorrah,\r\nTyre and Sydon. He ought to have told us that in India he conversed with\r\nthe Brahmins, and read the Shasta, five thousand years old, written in\r\nthe language of the sacred Sansosistes, with the elegance and sentiments\r\nof Plato. Where is to be found theology more orthodox, or philosophy more\r\nprofound, than in the introduction to the Shasta? \"God is one creator\r\nof all universal sphere, without beginning, without end. God governs all\r\nthe creation by a general providence, resulting from his eternal designs.\r\nSearch not the essence and the nature of the eternal, who is one; your\r\nresearch will be vain and presumptuous. It is enough that, day by day,\r\nand night by night, you adore his power, his wisdom and his goodness,\r\nin his works. The eternal willed in the fullness of time, to communicate\r\nof his essence and of his splendor, to beings capable of perceiving it.\r\nThey as yet existed not. The eternal willed and they were. He created\r\nBirma, Vitsnou and Siv.\" These doctrines, sublime, if ever there were\r\nany sublime, Pythagoras learned in India, and taught them to Zaleucus\r\nand his other disciples. He there learned also his Metempsychosis, but\r\nthis never was popular, never made much progress in Greece or Italy,\r\nor any other country besides India and Tartary, the region of the grand\r\nimmortal Lama. And how does this differ from the possessions of demons\r\nin Greece and Rome? from the demon of Socrates? from the worship of cows\r\nand crocodiles in Egypt and elsewhere?\r\n\r\nAfter migrating through various animals, from elephants to serpents,\r\naccording to their behavior, souls that at last behaved well, became\r\nmen and women, and then if they were good, they went to heaven.\r\n\r\nAll ended in heaven, if they became virtuous. Who can wonder at the widow\r\nof Malabar? Where is the lady, who, if her faith were without doubt that\r\nshe should go to heaven with her husband on the one, or migrate into\r\na toad or a wasp on the other, would not lay down on the pile, and set\r\nfire to the fuel?\r\n\r\nModifications and disguises of the Metempsychosis, has crept into Egypt,\r\nand Greece, and Rome, and other countries. Have you read Farmer on the\r\nDæmons and possessions of the New Testament? According to the Shasta,\r\nMoisasor, with his companions, rebelled against the eternal, and were\r\nprecipitated down to Ondoro, the region of darkness.\r\n\r\nDo you know anything of the Prophecy of Enoch? Can you give me a comment\r\non the 6th, the 9th, the 14th verses of the epistle of Jude?\r\n\r\nIf I am not weary of writing, I am sure you must be of reading such\r\nincoherent rattle. I will not persecute you so severely in future, if\r\nI can help it.\r\n\r\nSo farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THOMAS LIEPER.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, January 1, 1814.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I had hoped, when I retired from the business of the world,\r\nthat I should have been permitted to pass the evening of life in\r\ntranquillity, undisturbed by the peltings and passions of which the\r\npublic papers are the vehicles. I see, however, that I have been dragged\r\ninto the newspapers by the infidelity of one with whom I was formerly\r\nintimate, but who has abandoned the American principles out of which that\r\nintimacy grew, and become the bigoted partisan of England, and malcontent\r\nof his own government. In a letter which he wrote to me, he earnestly\r\nbesought me to avail our country of the good understanding which existed\r\nbetween the executive and myself, by recommending an offer of such terms\r\nto our enemy as might produce a peace, towards which he was confident\r\nthat enemy was disposed. In my answer, I stated the aggressions, the\r\ninsults and injuries, which England had been heaping on us for years,\r\nour long forbearance in the hope she might be led by time and reflection\r\nto a sounder view of her own interests, and of their connection with\r\njustice to us, the repeated propositions for accommodation made by us and\r\nrejected by her, and at length her Prince Regent's solemn proclamation\r\nto the world that he would never repeal the orders in council _as to\r\nus_, until France should have revoked her illegal decrees _as to all\r\nthe world_, and her minister's declaration to ours, that no admissible\r\nprecaution against the impressment of our seamen, could be proposed: that\r\nthe unavoidable declaration of war which followed these was accompanied\r\nby advances for peace, on terms which no American could dispense with,\r\nmade through various channels, and unnoticed and unanswered through any;\r\nbut that if he could suggest any other conditions which we ought to\r\naccept, and which had not been repeatedly offered and rejected, I was\r\nready to be the channel of their conveyance to the government; and, to\r\nshow him that neither that attachment to Bonaparte nor French influence,\r\nwhich they allege eternally without believing it themselves, affected\r\nmy mind, I threw in the two little sentences of the printed extract\r\nenclosed in your friendly favor of the 9th ultimo, and exactly these two\r\nlittle sentences, from a letter of two or three pages, he has thought\r\nproper to publish, naked, alone, and with my name, although other parts\r\nof the letter would have shown that I wished such limits only to the\r\nsuccesses of Bonaparte, as should not prevent his completely closing\r\nEurope against British manufactures and commerce; and thereby reducing\r\nher to just terms of peace with us.\r\n\r\nThus am I situated. I receive letters from all quarters, some from known\r\nfriends, some from those who write like friends, on various subjects.\r\nWhat am I to do? Am I to button myself up in Jesuitical reserve, rudely\r\ndeclining any answer, or answering in terms so unmeaning as only to\r\nprove my distrust? Must I withdraw myself from all interchange, of\r\nsentiment with the world? I cannot do this. It is at war with my habits\r\nand temper. I cannot act as if all men were unfaithful because some are\r\nso; nor believe that all will betray me, because some do. I had rather\r\nbe the victim of occasional infidelities, than relinquish my general\r\nconfidence in the honesty of man.\r\n\r\nSo far as to the breach of confidence which has brought me into the\r\nnewspapers, with a view to embroil me with my friends, by a supposed\r\nseparation in opinion and principle from them. But it is impossible that\r\nthere can be any difference of opinion among us on the two propositions\r\ncontained in these two little sentences, when explained, as they were\r\nexplained in the context from which they were insulated. That Bonaparte\r\nis an unprincipled tyrant, who is deluging the continent of Europe with\r\nblood, there is not a human being, not even the wife of his bosom,\r\nwho does not see: nor can there, I think, be a doubt as to the line\r\nwe ought to wish drawn between his successes and those of Alexander.\r\nSurely none of us wish to see Bonaparte conquer Russia, and lay thus\r\nat his feet the whole continent of Europe. This done, England would be\r\nbut a breakfast; and, although I am free from the visionary fears which\r\nthe votaries of England have effected to entertain, because I believe\r\nhe cannot effect the conquest of Europe; yet put all Europe into his\r\nhands, and he might spare such a force, to be sent in British ships,\r\nas I would as leave not have to encounter, when I see how much trouble\r\na handful of British soldiers in Canada has given us. No. It cannot be\r\nto our interest that all Europe should be reduced to a single monarchy.\r\nThe true line of interest for us, is, that Bonaparte should be able to\r\neffect the complete exclusion of England from the whole continent of\r\nEurope, in order, as the same letter said, \"by this peaceable engine of\r\nconstraint, to make her renounce her views of dominion over the ocean,\r\nof permitting no other nation to navigate it but with her license, and\r\non tribute to her, and her aggressions on the persons of our citizens\r\nwho may choose to exercise their right of passing over that element.\"\r\nAnd this would be effected by Bonaparte's succeeding so far as to close\r\nthe Baltic against her. This success I wished him the last year, this\r\nI wish him this year; but were he again advanced to Moscow, I should\r\nagain wish him such disasters as would prevent his reaching Petersburg.\r\nAnd were the consequences even to be the longer continuance of our war,\r\nI would rather meet them than see the whole force of Europe wielded by\r\na single hand.\r\n\r\nI have gone into this explanation, my friend, because I know you will\r\nnot carry my letter to the newspapers, and because I am willing to trust\r\nto your discretion the explaining me to our honest fellow laborers,\r\nand the bringing them to pause and reflect, if any of them have not\r\nsufficiently reflected on the extent of the success we ought to wish to\r\nBonaparte, with a view to our own interests only; and even were we not\r\nmen, to whom nothing human should be indifferent. But is our particular\r\ninterest to make us insensible to all sentiments of morality? Is it\r\nthen become criminal, the moral wish that the torrents of blood this\r\nman is shedding in Europe, the sufferings of so many human beings, good\r\nas ourselves, on whose necks he is trampling, the burnings of ancient\r\ncities, devastations of great countries, the destruction of law and\r\norder, and demoralization of the world, should be arrested, even if it\r\nshould place our peace a little further distant? No. You and I cannot\r\ndiffer in wishing that Russia, and Sweden, and Denmark, and Germany,\r\nand Spain, and Portugal, and Italy, and even England, may retain their\r\nindependence. And if we differ in our opinions about Towers and his\r\nfour beasts and ten kingdoms, we differ as friends, indulging mutual\r\nerrors, and doing justice to mutual sincerity and honesty. In this spirit\r\nof sincere confidence and affection, I pray God to bless you here and\r\nhereafter.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DOCTOR WALTER JONES.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, January 2, 1814.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of November the 25th reached this place December the\r\n21st, having been near a month on the way. How this could happen I know\r\nnot, as we have two mails a week both from Fredericksburg and Richmond.\r\nIt found me just returned from a long journey and absence, during which\r\nso much business had accumulated, commanding the first attentions, that\r\nanother week has been added to the delay.\r\n\r\nI deplore, with you, the putrid state into which our newspapers have\r\npassed, and the malignity, the vulgarity, and mendacious spirit of those\r\nwho write for them; and I enclose you a recent sample, the production of\r\na New England judge, as a proof of the abyss of degradation into which\r\nwe are fallen. These ordures are rapidly depraving the public taste,\r\nand lessening its relish for sound food. As vehicles of information, and\r\na curb on our functionaries, they have rendered themselves useless, by\r\nforfeiting all title to belief. That this has, in a great degree, been\r\nproduced by the violence and malignity of party spirit, I agree with you;\r\nand I have read with great pleasure the paper you enclosed me on that\r\nsubject, which I now return. It is at the same time a perfect model of\r\nthe style of discussion which candor and decency should observe, of the\r\ntone which renders difference of opinion even amiable, and a succinct,\r\ncorrect, and dispassionate history of the origin and progress of party\r\namong us. It might be incorporated as it stands, and without changing a\r\nword, into the history of the present epoch, and would give to posterity\r\na fairer view of the times than they will probably derive from other\r\nsources. In reading it with great satisfaction, there was but a single\r\npassage where I wished a little more development of a very sound and\r\ncatholic idea; a single intercalation to rest it solidly on true bottom.\r\nIt is near the end of the first page, where you make a statement of\r\ngenuine republican maxims; saying, \"that the people ought to possess as\r\nmuch political power as can possibly exist with the order and security of\r\nsociety.\" Instead of this, I would say, \"that the people, being the only\r\nsafe depository of power, should exercise in person every function which\r\ntheir qualifications enable them to exercise, consistently with the order\r\nand security of society; that we now find them equal to the election of\r\nthose who shall be invested with their executive and legislative powers,\r\nand to act themselves in the judiciary, as judges in questions of fact;\r\nthat the range of their powers ought to be enlarged,\" &c. This gives\r\nboth the reason and exemplication of the maxim you express, \"that they\r\nought to possess as much political power,\" &c. I see nothing to correct\r\neither in your facts or principles.\r\n\r\nYou say that in taking General Washington on your shoulders, to bear him\r\nharmless through the federal coalition, you encounter a perilous topic.\r\nI do not think so. You have given the genuine history of the course of\r\nhis mind through the trying scenes in which it was engaged, and of the\r\nseductions by which it was deceived, but not depraved. I think I knew\r\nGeneral Washington intimately and thoroughly; and were I called on to\r\ndelineate his character, it should be in terms like these.\r\n\r\nHis mind was great and powerful, without being of the very first order;\r\nhis penetration strong, though not so acute as that of a Newton, Bacon,\r\nor Locke; and as far as he saw, no judgment was ever sounder. It was slow\r\nin operation, being little aided by invention or imagination, but sure in\r\nconclusion. Hence the common remark of his officers, of the advantage he\r\nderived from councils of war, where hearing all suggestions, he selected\r\nwhatever was best; and certainly no General ever planned his battles\r\nmore judiciously. But if deranged during the course of the action, if any\r\nmember of his plan was dislocated by sudden circumstances, he was slow in\r\nre-adjustment. The consequence was, that he often failed in the field,\r\nand rarely against an enemy in station, as at Boston and York. He was\r\nincapable of fear, meeting personal dangers with the calmest unconcern.\r\nPerhaps the strongest feature in his character was prudence, never acting\r\nuntil every circumstance, every consideration, was maturely weighed;\r\nrefraining if he saw a doubt, but, when once decided, going through with\r\nhis purpose, whatever obstacles opposed. His integrity was most pure, his\r\njustice the most inflexible I have ever known, no motives of interest or\r\nconsanguinity, of friendship or hatred, being able to bias his decision.\r\nHe was, indeed, in every sense of the words, a wise, a good, and a great\r\nman. His temper was naturally irritable and high toned; but reflection\r\nand resolution had obtained a firm and habitual ascendency over it. If\r\never, however, it broke its bonds, he was most tremendous in his wrath.\r\nIn his expenses he was honorable, but exact; liberal in contributions to\r\nwhatever promised utility; but frowning and unyielding on all visionary\r\nprojects, and all unworthy calls on his charity. His heart was not warm\r\nin its affections; but he exactly calculated every man's value, and gave\r\nhim a solid esteem proportioned to it. His person, you know, was fine,\r\nhis stature exactly what one would wish, his deportment easy, erect and\r\nnoble; the best horseman of his age, and the most graceful figure that\r\ncould be seen on horseback. Although in the circle of his friends, where\r\nhe might be unreserved with safety, he took a free share in conversation,\r\nhis colloquial talents were not above mediocrity, possessing neither\r\ncopiousness of ideas, nor fluency of words. In public, when called on for\r\na sudden opinion, he was unready, short and embarrassed. Yet he wrote\r\nreadily, rather diffusely, in an easy and correct style. This he had\r\nacquired by conversation with the world, for his education was merely\r\nreading, writing and common arithmetic, to which he added surveying at\r\na later day. His time was employed in action chiefly, reading little,\r\nand that only in agriculture and English history. His correspondence\r\nbecame necessarily extensive, and, with journalizing his agricultural\r\nproceedings, occupied most of his leisure hours within doors. On the\r\nwhole, his character was, in its mass, perfect, in nothing bad, in few\r\npoints indifferent; and it may truly be said, that never did nature and\r\nfortune combine more perfectly to make a man great, and to place him in\r\nthe same constellation with whatever worthies have merited from man an\r\neverlasting remembrance. For his was the singular destiny and merit, of\r\nleading the armies of his country successfully through an arduous war,\r\nfor the establishment of its independence; of conducting its councils\r\nthrough the birth of a government, new in its forms and principles, until\r\nit had settled down into a quiet and orderly train; and of scrupulously\r\nobeying the laws through the whole of his career, civil and military,\r\nof which the history of the world furnishes no other example.\r\n\r\nHow, then, can it be perilous for you to take such a man on your\r\nshoulders? I am satisfied the great body of republicans think of him as\r\nI do. We were, indeed, dissatisfied with him on his ratification of the\r\nBritish treaty. But this was short lived. We knew his honesty, the wiles\r\nwith which he was encompassed, and that age had already began to relax the\r\nfirmness of his purposes; and I am convinced he is more deeply seated in\r\nthe love and gratitude of the republicans, than in the Pharisaical homage\r\nof the federal monarchists. For he was no monarchist from preference\r\nof his judgment. The soundness of that gave him correct views of the\r\nrights of man, and his severe justice devoted him to them. He has often\r\ndeclared to me that he considered our new constitution as an experiment\r\non the practicability of republican government, and with what dose of\r\nliberty man could be trusted for his own good; that he was determined\r\nthe experiment should have a fair trial, and would lose the last drop\r\nof his blood in support of it. And these declarations he repeated to me\r\nthe oftener and more pointedly, because he knew my suspicions of Colonel\r\nHamilton's views, and probably had heard from him the same declarations\r\nwhich I had, to wit, \"that the British constitution, with its unequal\r\nrepresentation, corruption and other existing abuses, was the most\r\nperfect government which had ever been established on earth, and that a\r\nreformation of those abuses would make it an impracticable government.\"\r\nI do believe that General Washington had not a firm confidence in the\r\ndurability of our government. He was naturally distrustful of men, and\r\ninclined to gloomy apprehensions; and I was ever persuaded that a belief\r\nthat we must at length end in something like a British constitution,\r\nhad some weight in his adoption of the ceremonies of levees, birth-days,\r\npompous meetings with Congress, and other forms of the same character,\r\ncalculated to prepare us gradually for a change which he believed\r\npossible, and to let it come on with as little shock as might be to the\r\npublic mind.\r\n\r\nThese are my opinions of General Washington, which I would vouch at the\r\njudgment seat of God, having been formed on an acquaintance of thirty\r\nyears. I served with him in the Virginia legislature from 1769 to the\r\nRevolutionary war, and again, a short time in Congress, until he left us\r\nto take command of the army. During the war and after it we corresponded\r\noccasionally, and in the four years of my continuance in the office of\r\nSecretary of State, our intercourse was daily, confidential and cordial.\r\nAfter I retired from that office, great and malignant pains were taken\r\nby our federal monarchists, and not entirely without effect, to make him\r\nview me as a theorist, holding French principles of government, which\r\nwould lead infallibly to licentiousness and anarchy. And to this he\r\nlistened the more easily, from my known disapprobation of the British\r\ntreaty. I never saw him afterwards, or these malignant insinuations\r\nshould have been dissipated before his just judgment, as mists before\r\nthe sun. I felt on his death, with my countrymen, that \"verily a great\r\nman hath fallen this day in Israel.\"\r\n\r\nMore time and recollection would enable me to add many other traits of\r\nhis character; but why add them to you who knew him well? And I cannot\r\njustify to myself a longer detention of your paper.\r\n\r\n_Vale, proprieque tuum, me esse tibi persuadeas._\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN PINTARD RECORDING SECRETARY OF THE NEW YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, January 9, 1814.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have duly received your favor of December 22d, informing me that\r\nthe New York Historical Society had been pleased to elect me an honorary\r\nmember of that institution. I am entirely sensible of the honor done me\r\nby this election, and I pray you to become the channel of my grateful\r\nacknowledgments to the society. At this distance, and at my time of life,\r\nI cannot but be conscious how little it will be in my power to further\r\ntheir establishment, and that I should be but an unprofitable member,\r\ncarrying into the institution indeed, my best wishes for its success,\r\nand a readiness to serve it on any occasion which should occur. With\r\nthese acknowledgments, be so good as to accept for the society, as well\r\nas for yourself, the assurances of my high respect and consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SAMUEL M. BURNSIDE, SECRETARY OF THE AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, January 9, 1814.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have duly received your favor of the 13th of December, informing\r\nme of the institution of the American Antiquarian Society, and expressing\r\nits disposition to honor me with an admission into it, and the request\r\nof my co-operation in the advancement of its objects. No one can be more\r\nsensible of the honor and the favor of these dispositions, and I pray\r\nyou to have the goodness to testify to them all the gratitude I feel\r\non receiving assurances of them. There has been a time of life when I\r\nshould have entered into their views with zeal, and with a hope of not\r\nbeing altogether unuseful. But, now more than septuagenary, retired\r\nfrom the active scenes and business of life, I am sensible how little\r\nI can contribute to the advancement of the objects of their views; but\r\nI shall certainly, and with great pleasure, embrace any occasion which\r\nshall occur, of rendering them any services in my power. With these\r\nassurances, be so good as to accept for them and for yourself, those of\r\nmy high respect and consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DOCTOR THOMAS COOPER.\r\n\r\n                                              MONTICELLO, January 16, 1814.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of November 8th, if it was rightly dated, did not\r\ncome to hand till December 13th, and being absent on a long journey, it\r\nhas remained unanswered till now. The copy of your introductory lecture\r\nwas received and acknowledged in my letter of July 12, 1812, with which I\r\nsent you Tracy's first volume on Logic. Your Justinian came safely also,\r\nand I have been constantly meaning to acknowledge it, but I wished, at\r\nthe same time, to say something more. I possessed Theopilus', Vinnius'\r\nand Harris' editions, but read over your notes and the _addenda et\r\ncorrifenda_, and especially the parallels with the English law, with\r\ngreat satisfaction and edification. Your edition will be very useful\r\nto our lawyers, some of whom will need the translation as well as the\r\nnotes. But what I had wanted to say to you on the subject, was that I\r\nmuch regret that instead of this work, useful as it may be, you had not\r\nbestowed the same time and research rather on a translation and notes\r\non Bracton, a work which has never been performed for us, and which I\r\nhave always considered as one of the greatest desiderata in the law.\r\nThe laws of England, in their progress from the earliest to the present\r\ntimes, may be likened to the road of a traveller, divided into distinct\r\nstages or resting places, at each of which a review is taken of the\r\nroad passed over so far. The first of these was Bracton's _De legibus\r\nAngliæ_; the second, Coke's Institutes; the third, the Abridgment of\r\nthe law by Matthew Bacon; and the fourth, Blackstone's Commentaries.\r\nDoubtless there were others before Bracton which have not reached us.\r\nAlfred, in the preface to his laws, says they were compiled from those\r\nof Ina, Offa, and Aethelbert, into which, or rather preceding them, the\r\nclergy have interpolated the 20th, 21st, 22d, 23d and 24th chapters of\r\nExodus, so as to place Alfred's preface to what was really his, awkwardly\r\nenough in the body of the work. An interpolation the more glaring, as\r\ncontaining laws expressly contradicted by those of Alfred. This pious\r\nfraud seems to have been first noted by Howard, in his _Contumes Anglo\r\nNormandes_ (188), and the pious judges of England have had no inclination\r\nto question it; [of this disposition in these judges, I could give you\r\na curious sample from a note in my common-place book, made while I was\r\na student, but it is too long to be now copied. Perhaps I may give it\r\nto you with some future letter.] This digest of Alfred of the laws of\r\nthe Heptarchy into a single code, common to the whole kingdom, by him\r\nfirst reduced into one, was probably the birth of what is called the\r\ncommon law. He has been styled, \"Magnus Juris Anglicani Conditor;\" and\r\nhis code, the Dom-Dec, or doom-book. That which was made afterwards\r\nunder Edward the Confessor, was but a restoration of Alfred's, with\r\nsome intervening alterations. And this was the code which the English\r\nso often, under the Norman princes, petitioned to have restored to them.\r\nBut, all records previous to the _Magna Charta_ having been early lost,\r\nBracton's is the first digest of the whole body of law which has come\r\ndown to us entire. What materials for it existed in his time we know\r\nnot, except the unauthoritative collections of Lambard & Wilkins, and\r\nthe treatise of Glanville, tempore H. 2. Bracton's is the more valuable,\r\nbecause being written a very few years after the _Magna Charta_, which\r\ncommences what is called the statute law, it gives us the state of the\r\ncommon law in its ultimate form, and exactly at the point of division\r\nbetween the common and statute law. It is a most able work, complete in\r\nits matter and luminous in its method.\r\n\r\n2. The statutes which introduced changes began now to be preserved;\r\napplications of the law to new cases by the courts, began soon after to\r\nbe reported in the year-books, these to be methodized and abridged by\r\nFitzherbert, Broke, Rolle, and others; individuals continued the business\r\nof reporting; particular treatises were written by able men, and all\r\nthese, by the time of Lord Coke, had formed so large a mass of matter\r\nas to call for a new digest, to bring it within reasonable compass.\r\nThis he undertook in his Institutes, harmonizing all the decisions and\r\nopinions which were reconcilable, and rejecting those not so. This work\r\nis executed with so much learning and judgment, that I do not recollect\r\nthat a single position in it has ever been judicially denied. And although\r\nthe work loses much of its value by its chaotic form, it may still be\r\nconsidered as the fundamental code of the English law.\r\n\r\n3. The same processes re-commencing of statutory changes, new divisions,\r\nmultiplied reports, and special treatises, a new accumulation had formed,\r\ncalling for new reduction, by the time of Matthew Bacon. His work,\r\ntherefore, although not pretending to the textual merit of Bracton's,\r\nor Coke's, was very acceptable. His alphabetical arrangement, indeed,\r\nalthough better than Coke's jumble, was far inferior to Bracton's. But it\r\nwas a sound digest of the materials existing on the several alphabetical\r\nheads under which he arranged them. His work was not admitted as authority\r\nin Westminster Hall; yet it was the manual of every judge and lawyer,\r\nand, what better proves its worth, has been its daily growth in the\r\ngeneral estimation.\r\n\r\n4. A succeeding interval of changes and additions of matter produced\r\nBlackstone's Commentaries, the most lucid in arrangement which had yet\r\nbeen written, correct in its matter, classical in style, and rightfully\r\ntaking its place by the side of the Justinian Institutes. But, like them\r\nit was only an elementary book. It did not present all the subjects of\r\nthe law in all their details. It still left it necessary to recur to\r\nthe original works of which it was the summary. The great mass of law\r\nbooks from which it was extracted, was still to be consulted on minute\r\ninvestigations. It wanted, therefore, a species of merit which entered\r\ndeeply into the value of those of Bracton, Coke and Bacon. They had in\r\neffect swept the shelves of all the materials preceding them. To give\r\nBlackstone, therefore, a full measure of value, another work is still\r\nwanting, to-wit: to incorporate with his principles a compend of the\r\nparticular cases subsequent to Bacon, of which they are the essence.\r\nThis might be done by printing under his text a digest like Bacon's\r\ncontinued to Blackstone's time. It would enlarge his work, and increase\r\nits value peculiarly to us, because just there we break off from the\r\nparent stem of the English law, unconcerned in any of its subsequent\r\nchanges or decisions.\r\n\r\nOf the four digests noted, the three last are possessed and understood\r\nby every one. But the first, the fountain of them all, remains in\r\nits technical Latin, abounding in terms antiquated, obsolete, and\r\nunintelligible but to the most learned of the body of lawyers. To give it\r\nto us then in English, with a glossary of its old terms, is a work for\r\nwhich I know nobody but yourself possessing the necessary learning and\r\nindustry. The latter part of it would be furnished to your hand from the\r\nglossaries of Wilkins, Lambard, Spelman, Somner in the X. Scriptores, the\r\nindex of Coke and the law dictionaries. Could not such an undertaking be\r\nconveniently associated with your new vocation of giving law lectures?\r\nI pray you to think of it.[8] A further operation indeed, would still be\r\ndesirable. To take up the doctrines of Bracton, _separatim et seriatim_,\r\nto give their history through the periods of Lord Coke and Bacon, down\r\nto Blackstone, to show when and how some of them have become extinct,\r\nthe successive alterations made in others, and their progress to the\r\nstate in which Blackstone found them. But this might be a separate work,\r\nleft for your greater leisure or for some future pen.[9]\r\n\r\nI have long had under contemplation, and been collecting materials for\r\nthe plan of an university in Virginia which should comprehend all the\r\nsciences useful to us, and none others. The general idea is suggested in\r\nthe Notes on Virginia, Qu. 14. This would probably absorb the functions\r\nof William and Mary College, and transfer them to a healthier and more\r\ncentral position: perhaps to the neighborhood of this place. The long and\r\nlingering decline of William and Mary, the death of its last president,\r\nits location and climate, force on us the wish for a new institution\r\nmore convenient to our country generally, and better adapted to the\r\npresent state of science. I have been told there will be an effort in\r\nthe present session of our legislature, to effect such an establishment.\r\nI confess, however, that I have not great confidence that this will\r\nbe done. Should it happen, it would offer places worthy of you, and of\r\nwhich you are worthy. It might produce, too, a bidder for the apparatus\r\nand library of Dr. Priestley, to which they might add mine on their\r\nown terms. This consists of about seven or eight thousand volumes, the\r\nbest chosen collection of its size probably in America, and containing\r\na great mass of what is most rare and valuable, and especially of what\r\nrelates to America.\r\n\r\nYou have given us, in your Emporium, Bollman's medley on Political\r\nEconomy. It is the work of one who sees a little of everything, and the\r\nwhole of nothing; and were it not for your own notes on it, a sentence\r\nof which throws more just light on the subject than all his pages, we\r\nshould regret the place it occupies of more useful matter. The bringing\r\nour countrymen to a sound comparative estimate of the vast value of\r\ninternal commerce, and the disproportionate importance of what is foreign,\r\nis the most salutary effort which can be made for the prosperity of\r\nthese States, which are entirely misled from their true interests by\r\nthe infection of English prejudices, and illicit attachments to English\r\ninterests and connections. I look to you for this effort. It would\r\nfurnish a valuable chapter for every Emporium; but I would rather see\r\nit also in the newspapers, which alone find access to every one.\r\n\r\nEverything predicted by the enemies of banks, in the beginning, is now\r\ncoming to pass. We are to be ruined now by the deluge of bank paper, as\r\nwe were formerly by the old Continental paper. It is cruel that such\r\nrevolutions in private fortunes should be at the mercy of avaricious\r\nadventurers, who, instead of employing their capital, if any they have, in\r\nmanufactures, commerce, and other useful pursuits, make it an instrument\r\nto burthen all the interchanges of property with their swindling profits,\r\nprofits which are the price of no useful industry of theirs. Prudent\r\nmen must be on their guard in this game of _Robin's alive_, and take\r\ncare that the spark does not extinguish in their hands. I am an enemy\r\nto all banks discounting bills or notes for anything but coin. But our\r\nwhole country is so fascinated by this Jack-lantern wealth, that they\r\nwill not stop short of its total and fatal explosion.[10]\r\n\r\nHave you seen the memorial to Congress on the subject of Oliver Evans'\r\npatent rights? The memorialists have published in it a letter of mine\r\ncontaining some views on this difficult subject. But I have opened it no\r\nfurther than to raise the questions belonging to it. I wish we could have\r\nthe benefit of your lights on these questions. The abuse of the frivolous\r\npatents is likely to cause more inconvenience than is countervailed by\r\nthose really useful. We know not to what uses we may apply implements\r\nwhich have been in our hands before the birth of our government, and\r\neven the discovery of America. The memorial is a thin pamphlet, printed\r\nby Robinson of Baltimore, a copy of which has been laid on the desk of\r\nevery member of Congress.\r\n\r\nYou ask if it is a secret who wrote the commentary on Montesquieu? It\r\nmust be a secret during the author's life. I may only say at present that\r\nit was written by a Frenchman, that the original MS. in French is now\r\nin my possession, that it was translated and edited by General Duane,\r\nand that I should rejoice to see it printed in its original tongue,\r\nif any one would undertake it. No book can suffer more by translation,\r\nbecause of the severe correctness of the original in the choice of its\r\nterms. I have taken measures for securing to the author his justly-earned\r\nfame, whenever his death or other circumstances may render it safe for\r\nhim. Like you, I do not agree with him in everything, and have had some\r\ncorrespondence with him on particular points. But on the whole, it is a\r\nmost valuable work, one which I think will form an epoch in the science\r\nof government, and which I wish to see in the hands of every American\r\nstudent, as the elementary and fundamental institute of that important\r\nbranch of human science.[11]\r\n\r\nI have never seen the answer of Governor Strong to the judges of\r\nMassachusetts, to which you allude, nor the Massachusetts reports in\r\nwhich it is contained. But I am sure you join me in lamenting the general\r\ndefection of lawyers and judges, from the free principles of government.\r\nI am sure they do not derive this degenerate spirit from the father of\r\nour science, Lord Coke. But it may be the reason why they cease to read\r\nhim, and the source of what are now called \"Blackstone lawyers.\"\r\n\r\nGo on in all your good works, without regard to the eye \"of suspicion\r\nand distrust with which you may be viewed by some,\" and without being\r\nweary in well doing, and be assured that you are justly estimated by\r\nthe impartial mass of our fellow citizens, and by none more than myself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [8] [Bracton has at length been translated in England.]\r\n\r\n    [9] [This has been done by Reeves, in his History of the Law.]\r\n\r\n    [10] [This accordingly took place four years after.]\r\n\r\n    [11] [The original has since been published in France, with\r\n    the name of its author, M. de Tutt Tracy.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTO OLIVER EVANS, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                              MONTICELLO, January 16, 1814.\r\n\r\nSIR,--In August last I received a letter from Mr. Isaac McPherson of\r\nBaltimore, on the controversies subsisting between yourself and some\r\npersons in that quarter interested in mills. These related to your\r\npatent rights for the elevators, conveyors, and hopper-boys; and he\r\nrequested any information I could give him on that subject. Having\r\nbeen formerly a member of the patent board, as long as it existed,\r\nand bestowed in the execution of that trust much consideration on the\r\nquestions belonging to it, I thought it an act of justice, and indeed\r\nof duty, to communicate such facts and principles as had occurred to me\r\non the subject. I therefore wrote the letter of August 13, which is the\r\noccasion of your favor to me of the 7th instant, just now received, but\r\nwithout the report of the case tried in the circuit court of Maryland,\r\nor your memorial to Congress, mentioned in the letter as accompanying\r\nit. You request an answer to your letter, which my respect and esteem\r\nfor you would of themselves have dictated; but I am not certain that I\r\ndistinguish the particular points to which you wish a specific answer.\r\nYou agree in the letter, that the chain of buckets and Archimedes screw\r\nare old inventions; that every one had, and still has, a right to use\r\nthem and the hopper-boy, if that also existed previously, in the forms\r\nand constructions known before your patent; and that, therefore, you have\r\nneither a grant nor claim, to the exclusive right of using elevators,\r\nconveyors, hopper-boys, or drills, but only of the improved elevator,\r\nthe improved hopper-boy, &c. In this, then, we are entirely agreed,\r\nand your right to your own improvements in the construction of these\r\nmachines is explicitly recognized in my letter. I think, however, that\r\nyour letter claims something more, although it is not so explicitly\r\ndefined as to convey to my mind the precise idea which you perhaps meant\r\nto express. Your letter says that your patent is for your improvement in\r\nthe manufacture of flour by the application of certain principles, and of\r\nsuch machinery as will carry those principles into operation, whether of\r\nthe improved elevator, improved hopper-boy, or (without being confined to\r\nthem) of any machinery known and free to the public. I can conceive how a\r\nmachine may improve the manufacture of flour; but not how a _principle_\r\nabstracted from any machine can do it. It must then be the machine, and\r\nthe principle of that machine, which is secured to you by your patent.\r\nRecurring now to the words of your definition, do they mean that, while\r\nall are free to use the old string of buckets, and Archimedes' screw for\r\nthe purposes to which they had been formerly applied, you alone have the\r\nexclusive right to apply them to the manufacture of flour? that no one\r\nhas a right to apply his old machines to all the purposes of which they\r\nare susceptible? that every one, for instance, who can apply the hoe,\r\nthe spade, or the axe to any purpose to which they have not been before\r\napplied, may have a patent for the exclusive right to that application?\r\nand may exclude all others, under penalties, from so using their hoe,\r\nspade, or axe? If this be the meaning, my opinion that the legislature\r\nnever meant by the patent law to sweep away so extensively the rights\r\nof their constituents, to environ everything they touch with snares,\r\nis expressed in the letter of August 13, from which I have nothing to\r\nretract, nor ought to add but the observation that if a new application\r\nof our old machines be a ground of monopoly, the patent law will take\r\nfrom us much more good than it will give. Perhaps it may mean another\r\nthing, that while every one has a right to the distinct and separate use\r\nof the buckets, the screw, the hopper-boy, in their old forms, the patent\r\ngives you the exclusive right to combine their uses on the same object.\r\nBut if we have a right to use three things separately, I see nothing in\r\nreason, or in the patent law, which forbids our using them all together.\r\nA man has a right to use a saw, an axe, a plane separately; may he not\r\ncombine their uses on the same piece of wood? He has a right to use his\r\nknife to cut his meat, a fork to hold it; may a patentee take from him\r\nthe right to combine their use on the same subject? Such a law, instead\r\nof enlarging our conveniences, as was intended, would most fearfully\r\nabridge them, and crowd us by monopolies out of the use of the things\r\nwe have.\r\n\r\nI have no particular interest, however, in these questions, nor any\r\ninclination to be the advocate of either party; and I hope I shall be\r\nexcused from it. I shall acquiesce cheerfully in the decisions in your\r\nfavor by those to whom the laws have confided them, without blaming\r\nthe other party for being unwilling, when so new a branch of science\r\nhas been recently engrafted on our jurisprudence, one with which its\r\nprofessors have till now had no call to make themselves acquainted, one\r\nbearing little analogy to their professional educations or pursuits. That\r\nthey should be unwilling, I say, to admit that one or two decisions,\r\nbefore inferior and local tribunals, before the questions shall have\r\nbeen repeatedly and maturely examined in all their bearings, before\r\nthe cases shall have presented themselves in all their forms and\r\nattitudes, before a sanction by the greater part of the judges on the\r\nmost solemn investigations, and before the industry and intelligence\r\nof many defendants may have excited to efforts for the vindication of\r\nthe general rights of the citizen; that one or other of the precedents\r\nshould forever foreclose the whole of a new subject.\r\n\r\nTo the publication of this answer with your letter, as you request, I have\r\nno objection. I wish right to be done to all parties, and to yourself,\r\nparticularly and personally, the just rewards of genius; and I tender\r\nyou the assurances of my great esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOSEPH C. CABELL, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                              MONTICELLO, January 17, 1814.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--In your last letter to me you expressed a desire to look into\r\nthe question whether, by the laws of nature, one generation of men can,\r\nby any act of theirs, bind those which are to follow them? I say, by the\r\nlaws of nature, there being between generation and generation, as between\r\nnation and nation, no other obligatory law; and you requested to see\r\nwhat I had said on the subject to Mr. Eppes. I enclose, _for your own\r\nperusal_, therefore, three letters which I wrote to him on the course of\r\nour finances, which embrace the question before stated. When I wrote the\r\nfirst, I had no thought of following it by a second. I was led to that by\r\nhis subsequent request, and after the second I was induced, in a third,\r\nto take up the subject of banks, by the communication of a proposition to\r\nbe laid before Congress for the establishment of a new bank. I mention\r\nthis to explain the total absence of order in these letters as a whole.\r\nI have said above that they are sent for _your own perusal_, not meaning\r\nto debar any use of the matter, but only that my name may in nowise be\r\nconnected with it. I am too desirous of tranquillity to bring such a\r\nnest of hornets on me as the fraternities of banking companies, and this\r\ninfatuation of banks is a torrent which it would be a folly for me to\r\nget into the way of. I see that it must take its course, until actual\r\nruin shall awaken us from its delusions. Until the gigantic banking\r\npropositions of this winter had made their appearance in the different\r\nlegislatures, I had hoped that the evil might still be checked; but I\r\nsee now that it is desperate, and that we must fold our arms and go to\r\nthe bottom with the ship. I had been in hopes that good old Virginia, not\r\nyet so far embarked as her northern sisters, would have set the example\r\nthis winter, of beginning the process of cure, by passing a law that,\r\nafter a certain time, suppose of six months, no bank bill of less than\r\nten dollars should be permitted. That after some other reasonable term,\r\nthere should be none less than twenty dollars, and so on, until those\r\nonly should be left in circulation whose size would be above the common\r\ntransactions of any but merchants. This would ensure to us an ordinary\r\ncirculation of metallic money, and would reduce the quantum of paper\r\nwithin the bounds of moderate mischief. And it is the only way in which\r\nthe reduction can be made without a shock to private fortunes. A sudden\r\nstoppage of this trash, either by law or its own worthlessness, would\r\nproduce confusion and ruin. Yet this will happen by its own extinction, if\r\nleft to itself. Whereas, by a salutary interposition of the legislature,\r\nit may be withdrawn insensibly and safely. Such a mode of doing it, too,\r\nwould give less alarm to the bank-holders, the discreet part of whom must\r\nwish to see themselves secured by some circumscription. It might be asked\r\nwhat we should do for change? The banks must provide it, first to pay\r\noff their five-dollar bills, next their ten-dollar bills and so on, and\r\nthey ought to provide it to lessen the evils of their institution. But\r\nI now give up all hope. After producing the same revolutions in private\r\nfortunes as the old Continental paper did, it will die like that, adding\r\na total incapacity to raise resources for the war.\r\n\r\nWithdrawing myself within the shell of our own State, I have long\r\ncontemplated a division of it into hundreds or wards, as the most\r\nfundamental measure for securing good government, and for instilling\r\nthe principles and exercise of self-government into every fibre of every\r\nmember of our commonwealth. But the details are too long for a letter, and\r\nmust be the subject of conversation, whenever I shall have the pleasure\r\nof seeing you. It is for some of you young legislators to immortalize\r\nyourselves by laying this stone as the basis of our political edifice.\r\n\r\nI must ask the favor of an early return of the enclosed papers, of which\r\nI have no copy. Ever affectionately yours.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. R. M. PATTERSON, SECRETARY OF THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY.\r\n\r\n                                              MONTICELLO, January 20, 1814.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have duly received your favor of the 7th, informing me that the\r\nAmerican Philosophical Society, at their meeting of that day, had been\r\npleased unanimously to elect me as President of the Society. I receive\r\nwith just sensibility this proof of their continued good will, and pray\r\nyou to assure them of my gratitude for these favors, of my devotedness\r\nto their service, and the pleasure with which at all times I should in\r\nany way be made useful to them.\r\n\r\nFor yourself be pleased to accept the assurance of my great esteem and\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO PRESIDENT ADAMS.\r\n\r\n                                              MONTICELLO, January 24, 1814.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have great need of the indulgence so kindly extended to me\r\nin your favor of December 25, of permitting me to answer your friendly\r\nletters at my leisure. My frequent and long absences from home are a first\r\ncause of tardiness in my correspondence, and a second the accumulation\r\nof business during my absence, some of which imperiously commands first\r\nattentions. I am now in arrear to you for your letters of November 12,\r\n14, 16, December 3, 19, 25.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nYou ask me if I have ever seen the work of I. W. Goethen's Schriften?\r\nNever; nor did the question ever occur to me before where get we the ten\r\ncommandments? The book indeed gives them to us verbatim, but where did\r\nit get them? For itself tells us they were written by the finger of God\r\non tables of stone, which were destroyed by Moses; it specifies those\r\non the second set of tables in different form and substance, but still\r\nwithout saying how the others were recovered. But the whole history of\r\nthese books is so defective and doubtful, that it seems vain to attempt\r\nminute inquiry into it; and such tricks have been played with their text,\r\nand with the texts of other books relating to them, that we have a right\r\nfrom that cause to entertain much doubt what parts of them are genuine.\r\nIn the New Testament there is internal evidence that parts of it have\r\nproceeded from an extraordinary man; and that other parts are of the\r\nfabric of very inferior minds. It is as easy to separate those parts, as\r\nto pick out diamonds from dunghills. The matter of the first was such\r\nas would be preserved in the memory of the hearers, and handed on by\r\ntradition for a long time; the latter such stuff as might be gathered up,\r\nfor imbedding it, anywhere, and at any time. I have nothing of Vives, or\r\nBudæus, and little of Erasmus. If the familiar histories of the Saints,\r\nthe want of which they regret, would have given us the histories of those\r\ntricks which these writers acknowledge to have been practised, and of the\r\nlies they agree have been invented for the sake of religion, I join them\r\nin their regrets. These would be the only parts of their histories worth\r\nreading. It is not only the sacred volumes they have thus interpolated,\r\ngutted, and falsified, but the works of others relating to them, and\r\neven the laws of the land. We have a curious instance of one of these\r\npious frauds in the laws of Alfred. He composed, you know, from the laws\r\nof the Heptarchy, a digest for the government of the United Kingdom,\r\nand in his preface to that work he tells us expressly the sources from\r\nwhich he drew it, to wit, the laws of Ina, of Offa and Aethelbert, (not\r\nnaming the Pentateuch.) But his pious interpolator, very awkwardly,\r\n_premises_ to his work four chapters of Exodus (from the 20th to the\r\n23d) as a part of the laws of the land; so that Alfred's _preface_ is\r\nmade to stand in the body of the work. Our judges too have lent a ready\r\nhand to further these frauds, and have been willing to lay the yoke of\r\ntheir own opinions on the necks of others; to extend the coercions of\r\nmunicipal law to the dogmas of their religion, by declaring that these\r\nmake a part of the law of the land. In the Year-Book 34, H. 6, p. 38, in\r\nQuære impedit, where the question was how far the common law takes notice\r\nof the ecclesiastical law, Prisot, Chief Justice, in the course of his\r\nargument, says, \"a tiels leis que ils de seint eglise ont, en _ancien\r\nscripture_, covient a nous a donner credence; car ces common luy sur\r\nquels touts manners leis sont fondes; et auxy, siv, nous sumus obliges\r\nde canustre lour esy de saint eglise,\" &c. Finch begins the business of\r\nfalsification by mistranslating and mistating the words of Prisot thus:\r\n\"to such laws of the church as have warrant in _holy scripture_ our law\r\ngiveth credence.\" Citing the above case and the words of Prisot in the\r\nmargin, Finch's law, B. 1, c. 3, here then we find _ancien scripture_,\r\nancient writing, translated \"holy scripture.\" This, Wingate, in 1658,\r\nerects into a maxim of law in the very words of Finch, but citing Prisot\r\nand not Finch. And Sheppard, tit. Religion, in 1675 laying it down in\r\nthe same words of Finch, quotes the Year-Book, Finch and Wingate. Then\r\ncomes Sir Matthew Hale, in the case of the King _v._ Taylor, 1 Ventr.\r\n293, 3 Keb. 607, and declares that \"Christianity is part and parcel of\r\nthe laws of England.\" Citing nobody, and resting it, with his judgment\r\nagainst the witches, on his own authority, which indeed was sound and\r\ngood in all cases into which no superstition or bigotry could enter.\r\nThus strengthened, the court in 1728, in the King _v._ Woolston, would\r\nnot suffer it to be questioned whether to write against Christianity\r\nwas punishable at common law, saying it had been so settled by Hale in\r\nTaylor's case, 2 Stra. 834. Wood, therefore, 409, without scruple, lays\r\ndown as a principle, that all blaspheming and profaneness are offences\r\nat the common law, and cites Strange. Blackstone, in 1763, repeats, in\r\nthe words of Sir Matthew Hale, that \"Christianity is part of the laws of\r\nEngland,\" citing Ventris and Strange, _ubi supra_. And Lord Mansfield,\r\nin the case of the Chamberlain of London _v._ Evans, in 1767, qualifying\r\nsomewhat the position, says that \"the essential principles of revealed\r\nreligion are part of the common law.\" Thus we find this string of\r\nauthorities all hanging by one another on a single hook, a mistranslation\r\nby Finch of the words of Prisot, or on nothing. For all quote Prisot,\r\nor one another, or nobody. Thus Finch misquotes Prisot; Wingate also,\r\nbut using Finch's words; Sheppard quotes Prisot, Finch and Wingate;\r\nHale cites nobody; the court in Woolston's case cite Hale; Wood cites\r\nWoolston's case; Blackstone that and Hale, and Lord Mansfield volunteers\r\nhis own _ipse dixit_. And who now can question but that the whole Bible\r\nand Testament are a part of the common law? And that Connecticut, in her\r\nblue laws, laying it down as a principle that the laws of God should be\r\nthe laws of their land, except where their own contradicted them, did\r\nanything more than express, with a salvo, what the English judges had\r\nless cautiously declared without any restriction? And what, I dare say,\r\nour cunning Chief Justice would swear to, and find as many sophisms to\r\ntwist it out of the general terms of our declarations of rights, and\r\neven the stricter text of the Virginia \"act for the freedom of religion,\"\r\nas he did to twist Burr's neck out of the halter of treason. May we not\r\nsay then with him who was all candor and benevolence, \"woe unto you, ye\r\nlawyers, for ye lade men with burthens grievous to bear.\"\r\n\r\nI think with you, that Priestley, in his comparison of the doctrines\r\nof philosophy and revelation, did not do justice to the undertaking.\r\nBut he felt himself pressed by the hand of death. Enfield has given us\r\na more distinct account of the ethics of the ancient philosophers; but\r\nthe great work of which Enfield's is an abridgment, Brucker's History of\r\nPhilosophy, is the treasure which I would wish to possess, as a book of\r\nreference or of special research only, for who could read six volumes\r\nquarto, of one thousand pages each, closely printed, of modern Latin?\r\nYour account of D'Argens' Œileus makes me wish for him also. Œileus\r\nfurnishes a fruitful text for a sensible and learned commentator. The\r\nAbbé Batteaux, which I have, is a meagre thing.\r\n\r\nYou surprise me with the account you give of the strength of family\r\ndistinction still existing in your State. With us it is so totally\r\nextinguished, that not a spark of it is to be found but lurking in the\r\nhearts of some of our old tories; but all bigotries hang to one another,\r\nand this in the Eastern States hangs, as I suspect, to that of the\r\npriesthood. Here youth, beauty, mind and manners, are more valued than\r\na pedigree.\r\n\r\nI do not remember the conversation between us which you mention in yours\r\nof November 15th, on your proposition to vest in Congress the exclusive\r\npower of establishing banks. My opposition to it must have been grounded,\r\nnot on taking the power from the States, but on leaving any vestige of\r\nit in existence, even in the hands of Congress; because it would only\r\nhave been a change of the organ of abuse. I have ever been the enemy of\r\nbanks, not of those discounting for cash, but of those foisting their\r\nown paper into circulation, and thus banishing our cash. My zeal against\r\nthose institutions was so warm and open at the establishment of the Bank\r\nof the United States, that I was derided as a maniac by the tribe of\r\nbank-mongers, who were seeking to filch from the public their swindling\r\nand barren gains. But the errors of that day cannot be recalled. The evils\r\nthey have engendered are now upon us, and the question is how we are to\r\nget out of them? Shall we build an altar to the old paper money of the\r\nrevolution, which ruined individuals but saved the republic, and burn\r\non that all the bank charters, present and future, and their notes with\r\nthem? For these are to ruin both republic and individuals. This cannot\r\nbe done. The mania is too strong. It has seized, by its delusions and\r\ncorruptions, all the members of our governments, general, special and\r\nindividual. Our circulating paper of the last year was estimated at two\r\nhundred millions of dollars. The new banks now petitioned for, to the\r\nseveral legislatures, are for about sixty millions additional capital,\r\nand of course one hundred and eighty millions of additional circulation,\r\nnearly doubling that of the last year, and raising the whole mass to\r\nnear four hundred millions, or forty for one, of the wholesome amount of\r\ncirculation for a population of eight millions circumstanced as we are,\r\nand you remember how rapidly our money went down after our forty for one\r\nestablishment in the revolution. I doubt if the present trash can hold as\r\nlong. I think the three hundred and eighty millions must blow all up in\r\nthe course of the present year, or certainly it will be consummated by\r\nthe re-duplication to take place of course at the legislative meetings\r\nof the next winter. Should not prudent men, who possess stock in any\r\nmonied institution, either draw and hoard the cash now while they can, or\r\nexchange it for canal stock, or such other as being bottomed on immovable\r\nproperty, will remain unhurt by the crush? I have been endeavoring to\r\npersuade a friend in our legislature to try and save this State from the\r\ngeneral ruin by timely interference. I propose to him, First, to prohibit\r\ninstantly, all foreign paper. Secondly, to give our banks six months to\r\ncall in all their five-dollar bills (the lowest we allow); another six\r\nmonths to call in their ten-dollar notes, and six months more to call\r\nin all below fifty dollars. This would produce so gradual a diminution\r\nof medium, as not to shock contracts already made--would leave finally,\r\nbills of such size as would be called for only in transactions between\r\nmerchant and merchant, and ensure a metallic circulation for those of\r\nthe mass of citizens. But it will not be done. You might as well, with\r\nthe sailors, whistle to the wind, as suggest precautions against having\r\ntoo much money. We must bend then before the gale, and try to hold fast\r\nourselves by some plank of the wreck. God send us all a safe deliverance,\r\nand to yourself every other species and degree of happiness.\r\n\r\nP. S. I return your letter of November 15th, as it requests, and supposing\r\nthat the late publication of the life of our good and really great\r\nRittenhouse may not have reached you, I send a copy for your acceptance.\r\nEven its episodes and digressions may add to the amusement it will furnish\r\nyou. But if the history of the world were written on the same scale,\r\nthe whole world would not hold it. Rittenhouse, as an astronomer, would\r\nstand on a line with any of his time, and as a mechanician, he certainly\r\nhas not been equalled. In this view he was truly great; but, placed\r\nalong side of Newton, every human character must appear diminutive, and\r\nnone would have shrunk more feelingly from the painful parallel than\r\nthe modest and amiable Rittenhouse, whose genius and merit are not the\r\nless for this exaggerated comparison of his over zealous biographer.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. JOHN CLARKE.\r\n\r\n                                              MONTICELLO, January 27, 1814.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your favor of December 2d came to hand some time ago, and I perceive\r\nin it the proofs of a mind worthily occupied on the best interests of our\r\ncommon country. To carry on our war with success, we want _able_ officers,\r\nand a sufficient number of soldiers. The former, time and trial can alone\r\ngive us; to procure the latter, we need only the tender of sufficient\r\ninducements and the assiduous pressure of them on the proper subjects.\r\nThe inducement of interest proposed by you, is undoubtedly the principal\r\none on which any reliance can be placed, and the assiduous pressure of\r\nit on the proper subjects would probably be better secured by making it\r\nthe interest and the duty of a given portion of the militia, rather than\r\nthat of a mere recruiting officer. Whether, however, it is the best mode,\r\nbelongs to the decision of others; but, satisfied that it is one of the\r\ngood ones, I forwarded your letter to a member of the government, who\r\nwill make it a subject of consideration by those with whom the authority\r\nrests. Whether the late discomfiture of Bonaparte will have the effect\r\nof shortening or lengthening our war, is uncertain. It is cruel that we\r\nshould have been forced to wish any success to such a destroyer of the\r\nhuman race. Yet while it was our interest and that of humanity that he\r\nshould not subdue Russia, and thus lay all Europe at his feet, it was\r\ndesirable to us that he should so far succeed as to close the Baltic to\r\nour enemy, and force him, by the pressure of internal distress, into a\r\ndisposition to return to the paths of justice towards us. If the French\r\nnation stand by Bonaparte, he may rally, rise again, and yet give Great\r\nBritain so much employment as to give time for a just settlement of our\r\nquestions with her. We must patiently wait the solution of this doubt\r\nby time. Accept the assurances of my esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. SAMUEL GREENHOW.\r\n\r\n                                              MONTICELLO, January 31, 1814.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your letter on the subject of the Bible Society arrived here while\r\nI was on a journey to Bedford, which occasioned a long absence from\r\nhome. Since my return, it has lain, with a mass of others accumulated\r\nduring my absence, till I could answer them. I presume the views of the\r\nsociety are confined to our own country, for with the religion of other\r\ncountries my own forbids intermeddling. I had not supposed there was a\r\nfamily in this State not possessing a Bible, and wishing without having\r\nthe means to procure one. When, in earlier life, I was intimate with\r\nevery class, I think I never was in a house where that was the case.\r\nHowever, circumstances may have changed, and the society, I presume,\r\nhave evidence of the fact. I therefore enclose you cheerfully, an order\r\non Messrs. Gibson & Jefferson for fifty dollars, for the purposes of the\r\nsociety, sincerely agreeing with you that there never was a more pure\r\nand sublime system of morality delivered to man than is to be found in\r\nthe four evangelists. Accept the assurance of my esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOSEPH C. CABELL.\r\n\r\n                                              MONTICELLO, January 31, 1814.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of the 23d is received. Say had come to hand safely.\r\nBut I regretted having asked the return of him; for I did not find in\r\nhim one new idea upon the subject I had been contemplating; nothing more\r\nthan a succinct, judicious digest of the tedious pages of Smith.\r\n\r\nYou ask my opinion on the question, whether the States can add any\r\nqualifications to those which the constitution has prescribed for their\r\nmembers of Congress? It is a question I had never before reflected on;\r\nyet had taken up an off-hand opinion, agreeing with your first, that they\r\ncould not; that to add new qualifications to those of the constitution,\r\nwould be as much an alteration as to detract from them. And so I think\r\nthe House of Representatives of Congress decided in some case; I believe\r\nthat of a member from Baltimore. But your letter having induced me to\r\nlook into the constitution, and to consider the question a little, I\r\nam again in your predicament, of doubting the correctness of my first\r\nopinion. Had the constitution been silent, nobody can doubt but that the\r\nright to prescribe all the qualifications and disqualifications of those\r\nthey would send to represent them, would have belonged to the State. So\r\nalso the constitution might have prescribed the whole, and excluded all\r\nothers. It seems to have preferred the middle way. It has exercised the\r\npower in part, by declaring some disqualifications, to wit, those of not\r\nbeing twenty-five years of age, of not having been a citizen seven years,\r\nand of not being an inhabitant of the State at the time of election. But\r\nit does not declare, itself, that the member shall not be a lunatic, a\r\npauper, a convict of treason, of murder, of felony, or other infamous\r\ncrime, or a non-resident of his district; nor does it prohibit to the\r\nState the power of declaring these, or any other disqualifications which\r\nits particular circumstances may call for; and these may be different in\r\ndifferent States. Of course, then, by the tenth amendment, the power is\r\nreserved to the State. If, wherever the constitution assumes a single\r\npower out of many which belong to the same subject, we should consider\r\nit as assuming the whole, it would vest the General Government with a\r\nmass of powers never contemplated. On the contrary, the assumption of\r\nparticular powers seems an exclusion of all not assumed. This reasoning\r\nappears to me to be sound; but, on so recent a change of view, caution\r\nrequires us not to be too confident, and that we admit this to be one\r\nof the doubtful questions on which honest men may differ with the purest\r\nmotives; and the more readily, as we find we have differed from ourselves\r\non it.\r\n\r\nI have always thought that where the line of demarcation between the\r\npowers of the General and the State governments was doubtfully or\r\nindistinctly drawn, it would be prudent and praiseworthy in both parties,\r\nnever to approach it but under the most urgent necessity. Is the necessity\r\nnow urgent, to declare that no non-resident of his district shall be\r\neligible as a member of Congress? It seems to me that, in practice,\r\nthe partialities of the people are a sufficient security against such\r\nan election; and that if, in any instance, they should ever choose a\r\nnon-resident, it must be one of such eminent merit and qualifications,\r\nas would make it a good, rather than an evil; and that, in any event,\r\nthe examples will be so rare, as never to amount to a serious evil. If\r\nthe case then be neither clear nor urgent, would it not be better to let\r\nit lie undisturbed? Perhaps its decision may never be called for. But if\r\nit be indispensable to establish this disqualification now, would it not\r\nlook better to declare such others, at the same time, as may be proper?\r\nI frankly confide to yourself these opinions, or rather no-opinions, of\r\nmine; but would not wish to have them go any farther. I want to be quiet;\r\nand although some circumstances, now and then, excite me to notice them,\r\nI feel safe, and happier in leaving events to those whose turn it is\r\nto take care of them; and, in general, to let it be understood, that I\r\nmeddle little or not at all with public affairs. There are two subjects,\r\nindeed, which I shall claim a right to further as long as I breathe,\r\nthe public education, and the sub division of counties into wards. I\r\nconsider the continuance of republican government as absolutely hanging\r\non these two hooks. Of the first, you will, I am sure, be an advocate,\r\nas having already reflected on it, and of the last, when you shall have\r\nreflected. Ever affectionately yours.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THOMAS COOPER, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                             MONTICELLO, February 10, 1814.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--In my letter of January 16, I promised you a sample from my\r\ncommon-place book, of the pious disposition of the English judges, to\r\nconnive at the frauds of the clergy, a disposition which has even rendered\r\nthem faithful allies in practice. When I was a student of the law, now\r\nhalf a century ago, after getting through Coke Littleton, whose matter\r\ncannot be abridged, I was in the habit of abridging and common-placing\r\nwhat I read meriting it, and of sometimes mixing my own reflections on\r\nthe subject. I now enclose you the extract from these entries which\r\nI promised. They were written at a time of life when I was bold in\r\nthe pursuit of knowledge, never fearing to follow truth and reason to\r\nwhatever results they led, and bearding every authority which stood in\r\ntheir way. This must be the apology, if you find the conclusions bolder\r\nthan historical facts and principles will warrant. Accept with them the\r\nassurances of my great esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n_Common-place Book._\r\n\r\n873. In Quare imp. in C. B. 34, H. 6, fo. 38, the def. Br. of Lincoln\r\npleads that the church of the pl. became void by the death of the\r\nincumbent, that the pl. and J. S. each pretending a right, presented\r\ntwo several clerks; that the church being thus rendered litigious, he\r\nwas not obliged, by the _Ecclesiastical law_ to admit either, until an\r\ninquisition de jure patronatus, in the ecclesiastical court: that, by\r\nthe same law, this inquisition was to be at the suit of either claimant,\r\nand was not _ex-officio_ to be instituted by the bishop, and at his\r\nproper costs; that neither party had desired such an inquisition; that\r\nsix months passed whereon it belonged to him of right to present as\r\non a lapse, which he had done. The pl. demurred. A question was, How\r\nfar the _Ecclesiastical law_ was to be respected in this matter by the\r\ncommon law court? and Prisot C. 3, in the course of his argument uses\r\nthis expression, \"A tiels leis que ils de seint eglise ont en _ancien\r\nscripture_, covient a nous a donner credence, car ces common ley sur\r\nquel touts manners leis sont fondés: et auxy, sin, nous sumus obligès de\r\nconustre nostre ley; et, sin, si poit apperer or á nous que liévesque ad\r\nfait comme un ordinary fera en tiel cas, adong nous devons ces adjuger\r\nbon autrement nemy,\" &c. It does not appear that judgment was given. Y.\r\nB. ubi supra. S. C. Fitzh. abr. Qu. imp. 89. Bro. abr. Qu. imp. 12. Finch\r\nmistakes this in the following manner: \"To such laws of the church as\r\nhave warrant in _Holy Scripture_, our law giveth credence,\" and cites\r\nthe above case, and the words of Prisot on the margin. Finch's law.\r\nB. 1, ch. 3, published 1613. Here we find \"ancien scripture\" [_ancient\r\nwriting_] converted into \"Holy Scripture,\" whereas it can only mean the\r\n_ancient written_ laws of the church. It cannot mean the Scriptures, 1,\r\nbecause the \"ancien scripture\" must then be understood to mean the \"Old\r\nTestament\" or Bible, in opposition to the \"New Testament,\" and to the\r\nexclusion of that, which would be absurd and contrary to the wish of those\r\nwho cite this passage to prove that the Scriptures, or Christianity, is\r\na part of the common law. 2. Because Prisot says, \"Ceo [est] common\r\nley, sur quel touts manners leis sont fondés.\" Now, it is true that the\r\necclesiastical law, so far as admitted in England, derives its authority\r\nfrom the common law. But it would not be true that the Scriptures so\r\nderive their authority. 3. The whole case and arguments show that the\r\nquestion was how far the Ecclesiastical law in general should be respected\r\nin a common law court. And in Bro. abr. of this case, Littleton says,\r\n\"Les juges del common ley prendra conusans quid est _lax ecclesiæ_, vel\r\nadmiralitatis, et trujus modi.\" 4. Because the particular part of the\r\nEcclesiastical law then in question, to wit, the right of the patron to\r\npresent to his advowson, was not founded on the law of God, but subject\r\nto the modification of the lawgiver, and so could not introduce any\r\nsuch general position as Finch pretends. Yet Wingate [in 1658] thinks\r\nproper to erect this false quotation into a maxim of the common law,\r\nexpressing it in the very words of Finch, but citing Prisot, wing. max.\r\n3. Next comes Sheppard, [in 1675,] who states it in the same words of\r\nFinch, and quotes the Year-Book, Finch and Wingate. 3. Shepp. abr. tit.\r\nReligion. In the case of the King _v._ Taylor, Sir Matthew Hale lays it\r\ndown in these words, \"Christianity is parcel of the laws of England.\"\r\n1 Ventr. 293, 3 Keb. 607. But he quotes no authority, resting it on his\r\nown, which was good in all cases in which his mind received no bias from\r\nhis bigotry, his superstitions, his visions about sorceries, demons,\r\n&c. The power of these over him is exemplified in his hanging of the\r\nwitches. So strong was this doctrine become in 1728, by additions and\r\nrepetitions from one another, that in the case of the King _v._ Woolston,\r\nthe court would not suffer it to be debated, whether to write against\r\nChristianity was punishable in the temporal courts at common law, saying\r\nit had been so settled in Taylor's case, ante 2, stra. 834; therefore,\r\nWood, in his Institute, lays it down that all blasphemy and profaneness\r\nare offences by the _common law_, and cites Strange ubi supra. Wood 409.\r\nAnd Blackstone [about 1763] repeats, in the words of Sir Matthew Hale,\r\nthat \"Christianity is part of the laws of England,\" citing Ventris and\r\nStrange ubi supra. 4. Blackst. 59. Lord Mansfield qualifies it a little\r\nby saying that \"The essential principles of revealed religion are part\r\nof the common law.\" In the case of the Chamberlain of London _v._ Evans,\r\n1767. But he cites no authority, and leaves us at our peril to find out\r\nwhat, in the opinion of the judge, and according to the measure of his\r\nfoot or his faith, are those essential principles of revealed religion\r\nobligatory on us as a part of the common law.\r\n\r\nThus we find this string of authorities, when examined to the beginning,\r\nall hanging on the same hook, a perverted expression of Prisot's, or\r\non one another, or nobody. Thus Finch quotes Prisot; Wingate also;\r\nSheppard quotes Prisot, Finch and Wingate; Hale cites nobody; the court\r\nin Woolston's case cite Hale; Wood cites Woolston's case; Blackstone\r\nthat and Hale; and Lord Mansfield, like Hale, ventures it on his own\r\nauthority. In the earlier ages of the law, as in the year-books, for\r\ninstance, we do not expect much recurrence to authorities by the judges,\r\nbecause in those days there were few or none such made public. But in\r\nlatter times we take no judge's word for what the law is, further than\r\nhe is warranted by the authorities he appeals to. His decision may bind\r\nthe unfortunate individual who happens to be the particular subject of\r\nit; but it cannot alter the law. Though the common law may be termed\r\n\"Lex non Scripta,\" yet the same Hale tells us \"when I call those parts\r\nof our laws Leges non Scriptæ, I do not mean as if those laws were\r\nonly oral, or communicated from the former ages to the latter merely\r\nby word. For all those laws have their several monuments in writing,\r\nwhereby they are transferred from one age to another, and without which\r\nthey would soon lose all kind of certainty. They are for the most part\r\nextant in records of pleas, proceedings, and judgments, in books of\r\nreports and judicial decisions, in tractates of learned men's arguments\r\nand opinions, preserved from ancient times and still extant in writing.\"\r\nHale's H. c. d. 22. Authorities for what is common law may therefore\r\nbe as well cited, as for any part of the Lex Scripta, and there is no\r\nbetter instance of the necessity of holding the judges and writers to a\r\ndeclaration of their authorities than the present; where we detect them\r\nendeavoring to make law where they found none, and to submit us at one\r\nstroke to a whole system, no particle of which has its foundation in the\r\ncommon law. For we know that the common law is that system of law which\r\nwas introduced by the Saxons on their settlement in England, and altered\r\nfrom time to time by proper legislative authority from that time to the\r\ndate of Magna Charta, which terminates the period of the common law, or\r\nlex non scripta, and commences that of the statute law, or Lex Scripta.\r\nThis settlement took place about the middle of the fifth century. But\r\nChristianity was not introduced till the seventh century; the conversion\r\nof the first Christian king of the Heptarchy having taken place about\r\nthe year 598, and that of the last about 686. Here, then, was a space\r\nof two hundred years, during which the common law was in existence, and\r\nChristianity no part of it. If it ever was adopted, therefore, into the\r\ncommon law, it must have been between the introduction of Christianity\r\nand the date of the Magna Charta. But of the laws of this period we have\r\na tolerable collection by Lambard and Wilkins, probably not perfect, but\r\nneither very defective; and if any one chooses to build a doctrine on\r\nany law of that period, supposed to have been lost, it is incumbent on\r\nhim to prove it to have existed, and what were its contents. These were\r\nso far alterations of the common law, and became themselves a part of\r\nit. But none of these adopt Christianity as a part of the common law.\r\nIf, therefore, from the settlement of the Saxons to the introduction of\r\nChristianity among them, that system of religion could not be a part of\r\nthe common law, because they were not yet Christians, and if, having their\r\nlaws from that period to the close of the common law, we are all able to\r\nfind among them no such act of adoption, we may safely affirm (though\r\ncontradicted by all the judges and writers on earth) that Christianity\r\nneither is, nor ever was a part of the common law. Another cogent proof\r\nof this truth is drawn from the silence of certain writers on the common\r\nlaw. Bracton gives us a very complete and scientific treatise of the\r\nwhole body of the common law. He wrote this about the close of the reign\r\nof Henry III., a very few years after the date of the Magna Charta. We\r\nconsider this book as the more valuable, as it was written about the\r\ntime which divides the common and statute law, and therefore gives us\r\nthe former in its ultimate state. Bracton, too, was an ecclesiastic,\r\nand would certainly not have failed to inform us of the adoption of\r\nChristianity as a part of the common law, had any such adoption ever\r\ntaken place. But no word of his, which intimates anything like it, has\r\never been cited. Fleta and Britton, who wrote in the succeeding reign\r\n(of Edward I.), are equally silent. So also is Glanvil, an earlier writer\r\nthan any of them, (viz.: temp. H. 2,) but his subject perhaps might not\r\nhave led him to mention it. Justice Fortescue Aland, who possessed more\r\nSaxon learning than all the judges and writers before mentioned put\r\ntogether, places this subject on more limited ground. Speaking of the\r\nlaws of the Saxon kings, he says, \"the ten commandments were made part\r\nof their laws, and consequently were once part of the law of England; so\r\nthat to break any of the ten commandments was then esteemed a breach of\r\nthe common law, of England; and why it is not so now, perhaps it may be\r\ndifficult to give a good reason.\" Preface to Fortescue Aland's reports,\r\nxvii. Had he proposed to state with more minuteness how much of the\r\nscriptures had been made a part of the common law, he might have added\r\nthat in the laws of Alfred, where he found the ten commandments, two\r\nor three other chapters of Exodus are copied almost verbatim. But the\r\nadoption of a part proves rather a rejection of the rest, as municipal\r\nlaw. We might as well say that the Newtonian system of philosophy is a\r\npart of the common law, as that the Christian religion is. The truth is\r\nthat Christianity and Newtonianism being reason and verity itself, in\r\nthe opinion of all but infidels and Cartesians, they are protected under\r\nthe wings of the common law from the dominion of other sects, but not\r\nerected into dominion over them. An eminent Spanish physician affirmed\r\nthat the lancet had slain more men than the sword. Doctor Sangrado, on\r\nthe contrary, affirmed that with plentiful bleedings, and draughts of\r\nwarm water, every disease was to be cured. The common law protects both\r\nopinions, but enacts neither into law. See post. 879.\r\n\r\n879. Howard, in his Contumes Anglo-Normandes, 1. 87, notices the\r\nfalsification of the laws of Alfred, by prefixing to them four chapters\r\nof the Jewish law, to wit: the 20th, 21st, 22d and 23d chapters of\r\nExodus, to which he might have added the 15th chapter of the Acts of the\r\nApostles, v. 23, and precepts from other parts of the scripture. These\r\nhe calls a _hors d'œuvre_ of some pious copyist. This awkward monkish\r\nfabrication makes the preface to Alfred's genuine laws stand in the body\r\nof the work, and the very words of Alfred himself prove the fraud; for he\r\ndeclares, in that preface, that he has collected these laws from those\r\nof Ina, of Offa, Aethelbert and his ancestors, saying nothing of any of\r\nthem being taken from the Scriptures. It is still more certainly proved\r\nby the inconsistencies it occasions. For example, the Jewish legislator\r\nExodus xxi. 12, 13, 14, (copied by the Pseudo Alfred § 13,) makes murder,\r\nwith the Jews, death. But Alfred himself, Le. xxvi., punishes it by\r\na fine only, called a Weregild, proportioned to the condition of the\r\nperson killed. It is remarkable that Hume (append. 1 to his History)\r\nexamining this article of the laws of Alfred, without perceiving the\r\nfraud, puzzles himself with accounting for the inconsistency it had\r\nintroduced. To strike a pregnant woman so that she die is death by\r\nExodus, xxi. 22, 23, and Pseud. Alfr. § 18; but by the laws of Alfred\r\nix., pays a Weregild for both woman and child. To smite out an eye, or\r\na tooth, Exod. xxi. 24-27. Pseud. Alfr. § 19, 20, if of a servant by his\r\nmaster, is freedom to the servant; in every other case retaliation. But\r\nby Alfr. Le. xl. a fixed indemnification is paid. Theft of an ox, or a\r\nsheep, by the Jewish law, Exod. xxii. 1, was repaid five-fold for the\r\nox and four-fold for the sheep; by the Pseudograph § 24, the ox double,\r\nthe sheep four-fold; but by Alfred Le. xvi., he who stole a cow and\r\na calf was to repay the worth of the cow and 401 for the calf. Goring\r\nby an ox was the death of the ox, and the flesh not to be eaten. Exod.\r\nxxi. 28. Pseud. Alfr. § 21 by Alfred Le. xxiv., the wounded person had\r\nthe ox. The Pseudograph makes municipal laws of the ten commandments,\r\n§ 1--10, regulates concubinage, § 12, makes it death to strike or to\r\ncurse father or mother, § 14, 15, gives an eye for an eye, tooth for\r\na tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burning for burning, wound for\r\nwound, strife for strife, § 19; sells the thief to repay his theft, §\r\n24; obliges the fornicator to marry the woman he has lain with, § 29;\r\nforbids interest on money, § 35; makes the laws of bailment, § 28, very\r\ndifferent from what Lord Holt delivers in Coggs v. Bernard, ante 92, and\r\nwhat Sir William Jones tells us they were; and punishes witchcraft with\r\ndeath, § 30, which Sir Matthew Hale, 1 H. P. C. B. 1, ch. 33, declares\r\nwas not a felony before the Stat. 1, Jac. 12. It was under that statute,\r\nand not this forgery, that he hung Rose Cullender and Amy Duny, 16 Car.\r\n2, (1662,) on whose trial he declared \"that there were such creatures as\r\nwitches he made no doubt at all; for first the Scripture had affirmed so\r\nmuch, secondly the wisdom of all nations had provided laws against such\r\npersons, and such hath been the judgment of this kingdom, as appears by\r\nthat act of Parliament which hath provided punishment proportionable to\r\nthe quality of the offence.\" And we must certainly allow greater weight\r\nto this position that \"it was no felony till James' Statute,\" laid\r\ndown deliberately in his H. P. C., a work which he wrote to be printed,\r\nfinished, and transcribed for the press in his life time, than to the\r\nhasty scripture that \"at _common law_ witchcraft was punished with death\r\nas heresy, by writ de Heretico Comburendo\" in his Methodical Summary\r\nof the P. C. p. 6, a work \"not intended for the press, not fitted for\r\nit, and which he declared himself he had never read over since it was\r\nwritten;\" Pref. Unless we understand his meaning in that to be that\r\nwitchcraft could not be punished at common law as witchcraft, but as\r\nheresy. In either sense, however, it is a denial of this pretended law\r\nof Alfred. Now, all men of reading know that these pretended laws of\r\nhomicide, concubinage, theft, retaliation, compulsory marriage, usury,\r\nbailment, and others which might have been cited, from the Pseudograph,\r\nwere never the laws of England, not even in Alfred's time; and of course\r\nthat it is a forgery. Yet palpable as it must be to every lawyer, the\r\nEnglish judges have piously avoided lifting the veil under which it was\r\nshrouded. In truth, the alliance between Church and State in England\r\nhas ever made their judges accomplices in the frauds of the clergy; and\r\neven bolder than they are. For instead of being contented with these\r\nfour surreptitious chapters of Exodus, they have taken the whole leap,\r\nand declared at once that the whole Bible and Testament in a lump, make\r\na part of the common law; ante 873: the first judicial declaration of\r\nwhich was by this same Sir Matthew Hale. And thus they incorporate into\r\nthe English code laws made for the Jews alone, and the precepts of the\r\ngospel, intended by their benevolent author as obligatory only in _foro\r\nconcientiæ_; and they arm the whole with the coercions of municipal law.\r\nIn doing this, too, they have not even used the Connecticut caution of\r\ndeclaring, as is done in their blue laws, that the laws of God shall\r\nbe the laws of their land, except where their own contradict them; but\r\nthey swallow the yea and nay together. Finally, in answer to Fortescue\r\nAland's question why the ten commandments should not now be a part of\r\nthe common law of England? we may say they are not because they never\r\nwere made so by legislative authority, the document which has imposed\r\nthat doubt on him being a manifest forgery.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DR. JOHN MANNERS.\r\n\r\n                                             MONTICELLO, February 22, 1814.\r\n\r\nSIR,--The opinion which, in your letter of January 24, you are pleased\r\nto ask of me, on the comparative merits of the different methods of\r\nclassification adopted by different writers on Natural History, is one\r\nwhich I could not have given satisfactorily, even at the earlier period\r\nat which the subject was more familiar; still less, after a life of\r\ncontinued occupation in civil concerns has so much withdrawn me from\r\nstudies of that kind. I can, therefore, answer but in a very general\r\nway. And the text of this answer will be found in an observation in your\r\nletter, where, speaking of nosological systems, you say that disease\r\nhas been found to be an unit. Nature has, in truth, produced units only\r\nthrough all her works. Classes, orders, genera, species, are not of\r\nher work. Her creation is of individuals. No two animals are exactly\r\nalike; no two plants, nor even two leaves or blades of grass; no two\r\ncrystallizations. And if we may venture from what is within the cognizance\r\nof such organs as ours, to conclude on that beyond their powers, we\r\nmust believe that no two particles of matter are of exact resemblance.\r\nThis infinitude of units or individuals being far beyond the capacity\r\nof our memory, we are obliged, in aid of that, to distribute them into\r\nmasses, throwing into each of these all the individuals which have a\r\ncertain degree of resemblance; to subdivide these again into smaller\r\ngroups, according to certain points of dissimilitude observable in\r\nthem, and so on until we have formed what we call a system of classes,\r\norders, genera and species. In doing this, we fix arbitrarily on such\r\ncharacteristic resemblances and differences as seem to us most prominent\r\nand invariable in the several subjects, and most likely to take a strong\r\nhold in our memories. Thus Ray formed one classification on such lines of\r\ndivision as struck him most favorably; Klein adopted another; Brisson a\r\nthird, and other naturalists other designations, till Linnæus appeared.\r\nFortunately for science, he conceived in the three kingdoms of nature,\r\nmodes of classification which obtained the approbation of the learned of\r\nall nations. His system was accordingly adopted by all, and united all\r\nin a general language. It offered the three great desiderata: First, of\r\naiding the memory to retain a knowledge of the productions of nature.\r\nSecondly, of rallying all to the same names for the same objects, so\r\nthat they could communicate understandingly on them. And Thirdly, of\r\nenabling them, when a subject was first presented, to trace it by its\r\ncharacter up to the conventional name by which it was agreed to be\r\ncalled. This classification was indeed liable to the imperfection of\r\nbringing into the same group individuals which, though resembling in the\r\ncharacteristics adopted by the author for his classification, yet have\r\nstrong marks of dissimilitude in other respects. But to this objection\r\nevery mode of classification must be liable, because the plan of creation\r\nis inscrutable to our limited faculties. Nature has not arranged her\r\nproductions on a single and direct line. They branch at every step, and\r\nin every direction, and he who attempts to reduce them into departments,\r\nis left to do it by the lines of his own fancy. The objection of bringing\r\ntogether what are disparata in nature, lies against the classifications\r\nof Blumenbach and of Cuvier, as well as that of Linnæus, and must\r\nforever lie against all. Perhaps not in equal degree; on this I do not\r\npronounce. But neither is this so important a consideration as that of\r\nuniting all nations under one language in Natural History. This had been\r\nhappily effected by Linnæus, and can scarcely be hoped for a second time.\r\nNothing indeed is so desperate as to make all mankind agree in giving up\r\na language they possess, for one which they have to learn. The attempt\r\nleads directly to the confusion of the tongues of Babel. Disciples of\r\nLinnæus, of Blumenbach, and of Cuvier, exclusively possessing their own\r\nnomenclatures, can no longer communicate intelligibly with one another.\r\nHowever much, therefore, we are indebted to both these naturalists, and\r\nto Cuvier especially, for the valuable additions they have made to the\r\nsciences of nature, I cannot say they have rendered her a service in\r\nthis attempt to innovate in the settled nomenclature of her productions;\r\non the contrary, I think it will be a check on the progress of science,\r\ngreater or less, in proportion as their schemes shall more or less\r\nprevail. They would have rendered greater service by holding fast to\r\nthe system on which we had once all agreed, and by inserting into that\r\nsuch new genera, orders, or even classes, as new discoveries should call\r\nfor. Their systems, too, and especially that of Blumenbach, are liable\r\nto the objection of giving too much into the province of anatomy. It\r\nmay be said, indeed, that anatomy is a part of natural history. In the\r\nbroad sense of the word, it certainly is. In that sense, however, it\r\nwould comprehend all the natural sciences, every created thing being a\r\nsubject of natural history in extenso. But in the subdivisions of general\r\nscience, as has been observed in the particular one of natural history,\r\nit has been necessary to draw arbitrary lines, in order to accommodate\r\nour limited views. According to these, as soon as the structure of any\r\nnatural production is destroyed by art, it ceases to be a subject of\r\nnatural history, and enters into the domain ascribed to chemistry, to\r\npharmacy, to anatomy, &c. Linnæus' method was liable to this objection\r\nso far as it required the aid of anatomical dissection, as of the heart,\r\nfor instance, to ascertain the place of any animal, or of a chemical\r\nprocess for that of a mineral substance. It would certainly be better to\r\nadopt as much as possible such exterior and visible characteristics as\r\nevery traveller is competent to observe, to ascertain and to relate. But\r\nwith this objection, lying but in a small degree, Linnæus' method was\r\nreceived, understood, and conventionally settled among the learned, and\r\nwas even getting into common use. To disturb it then was unfortunate.\r\nThe new system attempted in botany, by Jussieu, in mineralogy, by Haüy,\r\nare subjects of the same regret, and so also the no-system of Buffon,\r\nthe great advocate of individualism in opposition to classification. He\r\nwould carry us back to the days and to the confusion of Aristotle and\r\nPliny, give up the improvements of twenty centuries, and co-operate with\r\nthe neologists in rendering the science of one generation useless to\r\nthe next by perpetual changes of its language. In botany, Wildenow and\r\nPersoon have incorporated into Linnæus the new discovered plants. I do not\r\nknow whether any one has rendered us the same service as to his natural\r\nhistory. It would be a very acceptable one. The materials furnished by\r\nHumboldt, and those from New Holland particularly, require to be digested\r\ninto the Catholic system. Among these, the Ornithorhyncus mentioned\r\nby you, is an amusing example of the anomalies by which nature sports\r\nwith our schemes of classification. Although without mammæ, naturalists\r\nare obliged to place it in the class of mammiferæ; and Blumenbach,\r\nparticularly, arranges it in his order of Palmipeds and toothless genus,\r\nwith the walrus and manatie. In Linnæus' system it might be inserted as\r\na new genus between the anteater and manis, in the order of Bruta. It\r\nseems, in truth, to have stronger relations with that class than any\r\nother in the construction of the heart, its red and warm blood, hairy\r\ninteguments, in being quadruped and viviparous, and may we not say, in its\r\n_tout ensemble_, which Buffon makes his sole principle of arrangement?\r\nThe mandible, as you observe, would draw it towards the birds, were not\r\nthis characteristic overbalanced by the weightier ones before mentioned.\r\nThat of the Cloaca is equivocal, because although a character of birds,\r\nyet some mammalia, as the beaver and sloth, have the rectum and urinary\r\npassage terminating at a common opening. Its ribs also, by their number\r\nand structure, are nearer those of the bird than of the mammalia. It is\r\npossible that further opportunities of examination may discover the mammæ.\r\nThose of the Opossum are asserted, by the Chevalier d'Aboville, from his\r\nown observations on that animal, made while here with the French army,\r\nto be not discoverable until pregnancy, and to disappear as soon as the\r\nyoung are weaned. The Duckbill has many additional particularities which\r\nliken it to other genera, and some entirely peculiar. Its description\r\nand history needs yet further information.\r\n\r\nIn what I have said on the method of classing, I have not at all meant to\r\ninsinuate that that of Linnæus is intrinsically preferable to those of\r\nBlumenbach and Cuvier. I adhere to the Linnean because it is sufficient\r\nas a ground-work, admits of supplementary insertions as new productions\r\nare discovered, and mainly because it has got into so general use that\r\nit will not be easy to displace it, and still less to find another which\r\nshall have the same singular fortune of obtaining the general consent.\r\nDuring the attempt we shall become unintelligible to one another, and\r\nscience will be really retarded by efforts to advance it made by its\r\nmost favorite sons. I am not myself apt to be alarmed at innovations\r\nrecommended by reason. That dread belongs to those whose interests or\r\nprejudices shrink from the advance of truth and science. My reluctance is\r\nto give up an universal language of which we are in possession, without\r\nan assurance of general consent to receive another. And the higher the\r\ncharacter of the authors recommending it, and the more excellent what\r\nthey offer, the greater the danger of producing schism.\r\n\r\nI should seem to need apology for these long remarks to you who are\r\nso much more recent in these studies, but I find it in your particular\r\nrequest and my own respect for it, and with that be pleased to accept\r\nthe assurance of my esteem and consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS TO THOMAS JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n                                                    QUINCY, February, 1814.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I was nibbing my pen and brushing my faculties, to write a\r\npolite letter of thanks to Mr. Counsellor Barton, for his valuable memoirs\r\nof Dr. Rittenhouse, (though I could not account for his sending it to\r\nme), when I received your favor of January 25th. I now most cordially\r\nendorse my thanks over to you. The book is in the modern American style,\r\nan able imitation of Marshall's Washington, though far more entertaining\r\nand instructive; a Washington Mausoleum; an Egyptian pyramid. I shall\r\nnever read it any more than Taylor's aristocracy. Mrs. Adams reads it\r\nwith great delight, and reads to me what she finds interesting, and that\r\nis indeed the whole book. I have not time to hear it all.\r\n\r\nRittenhouse was a virtuous and amiable man, an exquisite mechanician,\r\nmaster of the astronomy known in his time; an expert mathematician, a\r\npatient calculator of numbers. But we have had a Winthrop, an Andrew\r\nOliver, a Willard, a Webber, his equals, and we have a Bowditch his\r\nsuperior in all these particulars, except the mechanism. But you know\r\nPhiladelphia is the heart, the censorium, the pineal gland of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nIn politics, Rittenhouse was a good, simple, ignorant, well-meaning,\r\nFranklinian democrat, totally ignorant of the world. As an anchorite,\r\nan honest dupe of the French Revolution; a mere instrument of Jonathan\r\nDickinson Sargent, Dr. Hutchinson, Genet, and Mifflin, I give him all\r\nthe credit of his Planetarium. The improvement of the Orrery to the\r\nPlanetarium was an easy, natural thought, and nothing was wanting but\r\ncalculations of orbits Distranus, and periods of revolutions; all of which\r\nwere made to his hands long before he existed. Patience, perseverance,\r\nand sleight of hand, is his undoubted merit and praise. I had read Taylor\r\nin the Senate, till his style was so familiar to me that I had not read\r\nthree pages, before I suspected the author. I wrote a letter to him,\r\nand he candidly acknowledged that the six hundred and fifty pages were\r\nsent me with his consent. I wait with impatience for the publication,\r\nand annunciation of the work. Arator ought not to have been adulterated\r\nwith politics, but his precept \"Gather up the fragments that nothing be\r\nlost,\" is of inestimable value in agriculture and horticulture. Every\r\nweed, cob, husk, stalk, ought to be saved for manure.\r\n\r\nYour researches in the laws of England establishing Christianity as\r\nthe law of the land, and part of the common law, are curious and very\r\nimportant. Questions without number will arise in this country. Religious\r\ncontroversies, and ecclesiastical contests, are as common, and will be\r\nas sharp as any in civil politics, foreign and domestic. In what sense,\r\nand to what extent the Bible is law, may give rise to as many doubts and\r\nquarrels as any of our civil, political, military, or maritime laws,\r\nand will intermix with them all, to irritate factions of every sort.\r\nI dare not look beyond my nose into futurity. Our money, our commerce,\r\nour religion, our National and State Constitutions, even our arts and\r\nsciences, are so many seed plots, of division, faction, sedition and\r\nrebellion. Everything is transmuted into an instrument of electioneering.\r\nElection is the grand Brahma, the immortal Lama, I had almost said, the\r\nJuggernaut; for wives are almost ready to burn upon the pile, and children\r\nto be thrown under the wheel. You will perceive, by these figures, that\r\nI have been looking into oriental history, and Hindoo religion. I have\r\nread voyages, and travels, and everything I could collect, and the last\r\nis Priestley's \"Comparison of the Institutions of Moses with those of\r\nthe Hindoos, and other Ancient Nations,\" a work of great labor, and\r\nnot less haste. I thank him for the labor, and forgive, though I lament\r\nthe hurry. You would be fatigued to read, and I, just recruiting from a\r\nlittle longer confinement and indisposition than I have had for thirty\r\nyears, have not strength to write many observations. But I have been\r\ndisappointed in the principal points of my curiosity:\r\n\r\n1st. I am disappointed by finding that no just comparison can be made,\r\nbecause the original Shasta, and the original Vedams are not obtained,\r\nor if obtained, not yet translated into any European language.\r\n\r\n2d. In not finding such morsels of the sacred books as have been\r\ntranslated and published, which are more honorable to the original Hindoo\r\nreligion than anything he has quoted.\r\n\r\n3d. In not finding a full development of the history of the doctrine of\r\nthe Metempsichosis which originated--\r\n\r\n4th. In the history of the rebellion of innumerable hosts of angels in\r\nHeaven against the Supreme Being, who after some thousands of years\r\nof war, conquered them, and hurled them down to the regions of total\r\ndarkness, where they have suffered a part of the punishment of their\r\ncrime, and then were mercifully released from prison, permitted to\r\nascend to earth, and migrate into all sorts of animals, reptiles, birds,\r\nbeasts, and men, according to their rank and character, and even into\r\nvegetables, and minerals, there to serve on probation. If they passed\r\nwithout reproach their several gradations, they were permitted to become\r\ncows and men. If as men they behaved well, _i. e._ to the satisfaction\r\nof the priests, they were restored to their original rank and bliss in\r\nHeaven.\r\n\r\n5th. In not finding the Trinity of Pythagoras and Plato, their contempt\r\nof matter, flesh, and blood, their almost adoration of fire and water,\r\ntheir metempsichosis, and even the prohibition of beans, so evidently\r\nderived from India.\r\n\r\n6th. In not finding the prophecy of Enoch deduced from India, in which\r\nthe fallen angels make such a figure. But you are weary. Priestley has\r\nproved the superiority of the Hebrews to the Hindoos, as they appear in\r\nthe Gentoo laws, and institutes of Menu; but the comparison remains to\r\nbe made with the Shasta.\r\n\r\nIn his remarks on Mr. Dupuis, page 342, Priestley says: \"The History\r\nof the fallen angels is another circumstance, on which Mr. Dupuis lays\r\nmuch stress. According to the Christians, he says, Vol. I, page 336,\r\nthere was from the beginning a division among the angels; some remaining\r\nfaithful to the light, and others taking the part of darkness, &c.; but\r\nthis supposed history is not found in the Scriptures. It has only been\r\ninferred, from a wrong interpretation of one passage in the 2d epistle\r\nof Peter, and a corresponding one in that of Jude, as has been shown by\r\njudicious writers. That there is such a person as the Devil, is not a\r\npart of my faith, nor that of many other Christians, nor am I sure that\r\nit was the belief of any of the Christian writers. Neither do I believe\r\nthe doctrine of demoniacal possessions, whether it was believed by the\r\nsacred writers or not; and yet my unbelief in these articles does not\r\naffect my faith in the great facts of which the Evangelists were eye\r\nand ear witnesses. They might not be competent judges in the one case,\r\nthough perfectly so with respect to the other.\"\r\n\r\nI will ask Priestley, when I see him, do you believe those passages in\r\nPeter and Jude to be interpolations? If so, by whom made? And when? And\r\nwhere? And for what end? Was it to support, or found, the doctrine of\r\nthe fall of man, original sin, the universal corruption, depravation and\r\nguilt of human nature and mankind; and the subsequent incarnation of God\r\nto make atonement and redemption? Or do you think that Peter and Jude\r\nbelieved the book of Enoch to have been written by the seventh from Adam,\r\nand one of the sacred canonical books of the Hebrew Prophets? Peter,\r\n2d epistle, c. 2d, v. 4th, says \"For if God spared not the angels that\r\nsinned, but cast them down to _hell_, and delivered them into chains of\r\n_darkness_ to be reserved unto Judgment.\" Jude, v. 6th says, \"and the\r\nangels which kept their first estate, but left their own habitations,\r\nhe hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness, unto the judgment\r\nof the great day.\" Verse 14th, \"And Enoch, also, the seventh from Adam,\r\nprophesied of these sayings, behold the Lord cometh with ten thousands of\r\nhis saints, to execute judgment upon all,\" &c. Priestley says, \"a wrong\r\ninterpretation\" has been given to these texts. I wish he had favored\r\nus with his right interpretation of them. In another place, page 326,\r\nPriestley says, \"There is no circumstance of which Mr. Dupuis avails\r\nhimself so much, or repeats so often, both with respect to the Jewish and\r\nChristian religions, as the history of the _Fall of Man_, in the book of\r\nGenesis.\" I believe with him, and have maintained in my writings, that\r\nthis history is either an allegory, or founded on uncertain tradition,\r\nthat it is an hypothesis to account for the origin of evil, adopted by\r\nMoses, which by no means accounts for the facts.\r\n\r\n_March 3d._ So far was written almost a month ago; but sickness has\r\nprevented progress. I had much more to say about this work. I shall never\r\nbe a disciple of Priestley. He is as absurd, inconsistent, credulous\r\nand incomprehensible, as Athanasius. Read his letter to the Jews in this\r\nvolume. Could a rational creature write it? Aye! such rational creatures\r\nas Rochefoucauld, and Condorcet, and John Taylor, in politics, and\r\nTowers' Jurieus, and French Prophets in Theology. Priestley's account\r\nof the philosophy and religion of India, appears to me to be such a\r\nwork as a man of busy research would produce--who should undertake to\r\ndescribe Christianity from the sixth to the twelfth century, when a\r\ndeluge of wonders overflowed the world; when miracles were performed\r\nand proclaimed from every convent, and monastery, hospital, churchyard,\r\nmountain, valley, cave and cupola.\r\n\r\nThere is a book which I wish I possessed. It has never crossed the\r\nAtlantic. It is entitled Acta Sanctorum, in forty-seven volumes in folio.\r\nIt contains the lives of the Saints. It was compiled in the beginning\r\nof the sixteenth century by Bollandus, Henschenius and Papebrock. What\r\nwould I give to possess in one immense mass, one stupendous draught,\r\nall the legends, true, doubtful and false.\r\n\r\nThese Bollandists dared to discuss some of the facts, and hint that\r\nsome of them were doubtful. E. G. Papebrock doubted the antiquity of the\r\nCarmellites from Elias; and whether the face of Jesus Christ was painted\r\non the handkerchief of St. Véronique; and whether the prepuce of the\r\nSaviour of the world, which was shown in the church of Antwerp, could\r\nbe proved to be genuine? For these bold scepticisms he was libelled in\r\npamphlets, and denounced by the Pope, and the Inquisition in Spain. The\r\nInquisition condemned him; but the Pope not daring to acquit or condemn\r\nhim, prohibited all writings pro. and con. But as the physicians cure one\r\ndisease by exciting another, as a fever by a salivation, this Bull was\r\nproduced by a new claim. The brothers of the Order of Charity asserted\r\na descent from Abraham, nine hundred years anterior to the Carmellites.\r\n\r\nA philosopher who should write a description of Christianism from the\r\nBollandistic Saints of the sixth and tenth century would probably produce\r\na work tolerably parallel to Priestley's upon the Hindoos.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GIDEON GRANGER, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                                 MONTICELLO, March 9, 1814.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your letter of February 22d came to hand on the 4th instant.\r\nNothing is so painful to me as appeals to my memory on the subject of\r\npast transactions. From 1775 to 1809, my life was an unremitting course\r\nof public transactions, so numerous, so multifarious, and so diversified\r\nby places and persons, that, like the figures of a magic lanthern,\r\ntheir succession was with a rapidity that scarcely gave time for fixed\r\nimpressions. Add to this the decay of memory consequent on advancing\r\nyears, and it will not be deemed wonderful that I should be a stranger as\r\nit were even to my own transactions. Of some indeed I retain recollections\r\nof the particular, as well as general circumstances; of others a strong\r\nimpression of the general fact, with an oblivion of particulars; but\r\nof a great mass, not a trace either of general or particular remains in\r\nmy mind. I have duly pondered the facts stated in your letter, and for\r\nthe refreshment of my memory have gone over the letters which passed\r\nbetween us while I was in the administration of the government, have\r\nexamined my private notes, and such other papers as could assist me in\r\nthe recovery of the facts, and shall now state them seriatim from your\r\nletter, and give the best account of them I am able to derive from the\r\njoint sources of memory and papers.\r\n\r\n\"I have been denounced as a Burrite; but you know that in 1800 I sent\r\nErving from Boston to inform Virginia of the danger resulting from his\r\nintrigues.\" I well remember Mr. Erving's visit to this State about that\r\ntime, and his suggestions of the designs meditated in the quarter you\r\nmention; but as my duties on the occasion were to be merely passive, he\r\nof course, as I presume, addressed his communications more particularly\r\nto those who were free to use them. I do not recollect his mentioning\r\nyou; but I find that in your letter to me of April 26, 1804, you state\r\nyour agency on that occasion, so that I have no reason to doubt the fact.\r\n\r\n\"That in 1803-4, on my advice, you procured Erastus Granger to inform\r\nDe Witt Clinton of the plan to elevate Burr in New York.\" Here I do\r\nnot recollect the particulars; but I have a general recollection that\r\nColonel Burr's conduct had already, at that date rendered his designs\r\nsuspicious; that being for that reason laid aside by his constituents\r\nas Vice President, and aiming to become the Governor of New York, it was\r\nthought advisable that the persons of influence in that State should be\r\nput on their guard; and Mr. Clinton being eminent, no one was more likely\r\nto receive intimations from us, nor any one more likely to be confided\r\nin for their communication than yourself. I have no doubt therefore of\r\nthe fact, and the less because in your letter to me of October 9, 1806,\r\nyou remind me of it.\r\n\r\nAbout the same period, that is, in the winter of 1803-4, another train\r\nof facts took place which, although not specifically stated in your\r\nletter, I think it but justice to yourself that I should state. I mean\r\nthe intrigues which were in agitation, and at the bottom of which we\r\nbelieved Colonel Burr to be; to form a coalition of the five eastern\r\nStates, with New York and New Jersey, under the new appellation of the\r\nseven eastern States; either to overawe the Union by the combination of\r\ntheir power and their will, or by threats of separating themselves from\r\nit. Your intimacy with some of those in the secret gave you opportunities\r\nof searching into their proceedings, of which you made me daily and\r\nconfidential reports. This intimacy to which I had such useful recourse,\r\nat the time, rendered you an object of suspicion with many as being\r\nyourself a partisan of Colonel Burr, and engaged in the very combination\r\nwhich you were faithfully employed in defeating. I never failed to\r\njustify you to all those who brought their suspicions to me, and to assure\r\nthem of my knowledge of your fidelity. Many were the individuals, then\r\nmembers of the legislature, who received these assurances from me, and\r\nwhose apprehensions were thereby quieted. This first project of Colonel\r\nBurr having vanished in smoke, he directed to the western country those\r\nviews which are the subject of your next article.\r\n\r\n\"That in 1806, I communicated by the first mail after I had got knowledge\r\nof the fact, the supposed plans of Burr in his western expedition;\r\nupon which communication your council was first called together to\r\ntake measures in relation to that subject.\" Not exactly on that single\r\ncommunication; on the 15th and 18th of September, I had received letters\r\nfrom Colonel George Morgan, and from a Mr. Nicholson of New York,\r\nsuggesting in a general way the manœuvres of Colonel Burr. Similar\r\ninformation came to the Secretary of State from a Mr. Williams of\r\nNew York. The indications, however, were so vague that I only desired\r\ntheir increased attention to the subject, and further communications\r\nof what they should discover. Your letter of October 16, conveying\r\nthe communications of General Eaton to yourself and to Mr. Ely gave a\r\nspecific view of the objects of this new conspiracy, and corroborating\r\nour previous information, I called the Cabinet together, on the 22d of\r\nOctober, when specific measures were adopted for meeting the dangers\r\nthreatened in the various points in which they might occur. I say your\r\nletter of October 16 gave this information, because its date, with the\r\ncircumstance of its being no longer on my files, induce me to infer it\r\nwas that particular letter, which having been transferred to the bundle\r\nof the documents of that conspiracy, delivered to the Attorney General,\r\nis no longer in my possession.\r\n\r\nYour mission of Mr. Pease on the route to New Orleans, at the time of\r\nthat conspiracy, with powers to see that the mails were expected, and\r\nto dismiss at once every agent of the Post Office whose fidelity could\r\nbe justly doubted, and to substitute others on the spot was a necessary\r\nmeasure, taken with my approbation; and he executed the trusts to my\r\nsatisfaction. I do not know however that my subsequent appointment of\r\nhim to the office of Surveyor General was influenced, as you suppose, by\r\nthose services. My motives in that appointment were my personal knowledge\r\nof his mathematical qualifications and satisfactory informations of the\r\nother parts of his character.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the dismission of the prosecutions for sedition in\r\nConnecticut, it is well known to have been a tenet of the republican\r\nportion of our fellow citizens, that the sedition law was contrary to\r\nthe constitution and therefore void. On this ground I considered it\r\nas a nullity wherever I met it in the course of my duties; and on this\r\nground I directed _nolle prosequis_ in all the prosecutions which had\r\nbeen instituted under it, and as far as the public sentiment can be\r\ninferred from the occurrences of the day, we may say that this opinion\r\nhad the sanction of the nation. The prosecutions, therefore, which were\r\nafterwards instituted in Connecticut, of which two were against printers,\r\ntwo against preachers, and one against a judge, were too inconsistent\r\nwith this principle to be permitted to go on. We were bound to administer\r\nto others the same measure of law, not which they had meted to us, but\r\nwe to ourselves, and to extend to all equally the protection of the same\r\nconstitutional principles. These prosecutions, too, were chiefly for\r\ncharges against myself, and I had from the beginning laid it down as a\r\nrule to notice nothing of the kind. I believed that the long course of\r\nservices in which I had acted on the public stage, and under the eye of\r\nmy fellow citizens, furnished better evidence to them of my character\r\nand principles, than the angry invectives of adverse partisans in whose\r\neyes the very acts most approved by the majority were subjects of the\r\ngreatest demerit and censure. These prosecutions against them, therefore,\r\nwere to be dismissed as a matter of duty. But I wished it to be done with\r\nall possible respect to the worthy citizens who had advised them, and\r\nin such way as to spare their feelings which had been justly irritated\r\nby the intemperance of their adversaries. As you were of that State and\r\nintimate with these characters, the business was confided to you, and\r\nyou executed it to my perfect satisfaction.\r\n\r\nThese I think are all the particular facts on which you have asked\r\nmy testimony, and I add with pleasure, and under a sense of duty, the\r\ndeclaration that the increase of rapidity in the movement of the mails\r\nwhich had been vainly attempted before, were readily undertaken by you\r\non your entrance into office, and zealously and effectually carried into\r\nexecution, and that the affairs of the office were conducted by you with\r\nability and diligence, so long as I had opportunities of observing them.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the first article mentioned in your letter, in which I\r\nam neither concerned nor consulted, I will yet, as a friend, volunteer\r\nmy advice. I never knew anything of it, nor would ever listen to such\r\ngossiping trash. Be assured, my dear Sir, that the dragging such a\r\nsubject before the public will excite universal reprobation, and they\r\nwill drown in their indignation all the solid justifications which\r\nthey would otherwise have received and weighed with candor. Consult\r\nyour own experience, reflect on the similar cases which have happened\r\nwithin your own knowledge, and see if ever there was a single one in\r\nwhich such a mode of recrimination procured favor to him who used it.\r\nYou may give pain where perhaps you wish it, but be assured it will\r\nre-act on yourself with double though delayed effect, and that it will\r\nbe one of those incidents of your life on which you will never reflect\r\nwith satisfaction. Be advised, then; erase it even from your memory,\r\nand stand erect before the world on the high ground of your own merits,\r\nwithout stooping to what is unworthy either of your or their notice.\r\nRemember that we often repent of what we have said, but never, never\r\nof that which we have not. You may have time enough hereafter to mend\r\nyour hold, if ever it can be mended by such matter as that. Take time\r\nthen, and do not commit your happiness and public estimation by too much\r\nprecipitancy. I am entirely uninformed of the state of things which you\r\nsay exists, and which will oblige you to make a solemn appeal to the\r\nnation, in vindication of your character. But whatever that be, I feel\r\nit a duty to bear testimony to the truth, and I have suggested with\r\nfrankness other considerations occurring to myself, because I wish you\r\nwell, and I add sincere assurances of my great respect and esteem.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HORATIO G. SPAFFORD.\r\n\r\n                                                MONTICELLO, March 17, 1814.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I am an unpunctual correspondent at best. While my affairs\r\npermit me to be within doors, I am too apt to take up a book and to forget\r\nthe calls of the writing-table. Besides this, I pass a considerable\r\nportion of my time at a possession so distant, and uncertain as to its\r\nmails, that my letters always await my return here. This must apologise\r\nfor my being so late in acknowledging your two favors of December 17th\r\nand January 28th, as also that of the Gazetteer, which came safely to\r\nhand. I have read it with pleasure, and derived from it much information\r\nwhich I did not possess before. I wish we had as full a statement as to\r\nall our States. We should know ourselves better, our circumstances and\r\nresources, and the advantageous ground we stand on as a whole. We are\r\ncertainly much indebted to you for this fund of valuable information.\r\nI join in your reprobation of our merchants, priests, and lawyers, for\r\ntheir adherence to England and monarchy, in preference to their own\r\ncountry and its constitution. But merchants have no country. The mere\r\nspot they stand on does not constitute so strong an attachment as that\r\nfrom which they draw their gains. In every country and in every age, the\r\npriest has been hostile to liberty. He is always in alliance with the\r\ndespot, abetting his abuses in return for protection to his own. It is\r\neasier to acquire wealth and power by this combination than by deserving\r\nthem, and to effect this, they have perverted the purest religion ever\r\npreached to man into mystery and jargon, unintelligible to all mankind,\r\nand therefore the safer engine for their purposes. With the lawyers it\r\nis a new thing. They have, in the mother country, been generally the\r\nfirmest supporters of the free principles of their constitution. But\r\nthere too they have changed. I ascribe much of this to the substitution of\r\nBlackstone for my Lord Coke, as an elementary work. In truth, Blackstone\r\nand Hume have made tories of all England, and are making tories of those\r\nyoung Americans whose native feelings of independence do not place them\r\nabove the wily sophistries of a Hume or a Blackstone. These two books,\r\nbut especially the former, have done more towards the suppression of the\r\nliberties of man, than all the million of men in arms of Bonaparte and\r\nthe millions of human lives with the sacrifice of which he will stand\r\nloaded before the judgment seat of his Maker. I fear nothing for our\r\nliberty from the assaults of force; but I have seen and felt much, and\r\nfear more from English books, English prejudices, English manners, and\r\nthe apes, the dupes, and designs among our professional crafts. When\r\nI look around me for security against these seductions, I find it in\r\nthe wide-spread of our agricultural citizens, in their unsophisticated\r\nminds, their independence and their power, if called on, to crush the\r\nHumists of our cities, and to maintain the principles which severed us\r\nfrom England. I see our safety in the extent of our confederacy, and\r\nin the probability that in the proportion of that the sound parts will\r\nalways be sufficient to crush local poisons. In this hope I rest, and\r\ntender you the assurance of my esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GIRARDIN.\r\n\r\n                                                MONTICELLO, March 18, 1814.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--According to your request of the other day, I send you my\r\nformula and explanation of Lord Napier's theorem, for the solution of\r\nright-angled spherical triangles. With you I think it strange that the\r\nFrench mathematicians have not used or noticed this method more than\r\nthey have done. Montucla, in his account of Lord Napier's inventions,\r\nexpresses a like surprise at this fact, and does justice to the ingenuity,\r\nthe elegance, and convenience of the theorem, which, by a single rule\r\neasily preserved in the memory, supplies the whole table of cases given\r\nin the books of spherical trigonometry. Yet he does not state the rule,\r\nbut refers for it to Wolf, Cours de Mathematiques. I have not the larger\r\nwork of Wolf; and in the French translation of his abridgement, (by\r\nsome member of the congregation of St. Maur,) the branch of spherical\r\ntrigonometry is entirely omitted. Potter, one of the English authors\r\nof Courses of Mathematics, has given the Catholic proposition, as it\r\nis called, but in terms unintelligible, and leading to error, until, by\r\nrepeated trials, we have ascertained the meaning of some of his equivocal\r\nexpressions. In Robert Simson's Euclid we have the theorem with its\r\ndemonstrations, but less aptly for the memory, divided into two rules, and\r\nthese are extended as the original was, only to the cases of right-angled\r\ntriangles. Hutton, in his Course of Mathematics, declines giving the\r\nrules, as \"too artificial to be applied by young computists.\" But I do\r\nnot think this. It is true that when we use them, their demonstration is\r\nnot always present to the mind; but neither is this the case generally in\r\nusing mathematical theorems, or in the various steps of an algebraical\r\nprocess. We act on them, however, mechanically, and with confidence,\r\nas truths of which we have heretofore been satisfied by demonstration,\r\nalthough we do not at the moment retrace the processes which establish\r\nthem. Hutton, however, in his Mathematical Dictionary, under the terms\r\n\"circular parts,\" and \"extremes,\" has given us the rules, and in all\r\ntheir extensions to oblique spherical, and to plane triangles. I have\r\nendeavored to reduce them to a form best adapted to my own frail memory,\r\nby couching them in the fewest words possible, and such as cannot, I\r\nthink, mislead, or be misunderstood. My formula, with the explanation\r\nwhich may be necessary for your pupils, is as follows:\r\n\r\nLord Napier noted first the parts, or elements of a triangle, to wit,\r\nthe sides and angles; and expunging from these the right-angle, as if\r\nit were a non-existence, he considered the other five parts, to wit,\r\nthe three sides, and two oblique angles, as arranged in a circle, and\r\ntherefore called them the circular parts; but chose, (for simplifying the\r\nresult,) instead of the hypothenuse and two oblique angles, themselves,\r\nto substitute their complements. So that his five circular parts are\r\nthe two legs themselves, and the complements of the hypothenuse and\r\nof the two oblique angles. If the three of these, given and required,\r\nwere all adjacent, he called it the case of conjunct parts, the middle\r\nelement the MIDDLE PART, and the two others the EXTREMES disjunct from\r\nthe middle or EXTREMES DISJUNCT. He then laid down his catholic rule,\r\nto wit:\r\n\r\n\"The rectangle of the radius, and sine of the middle part, is equal to\r\nthe rectangle of the _tangents_ of the two EXTREMES CONJUNCT, and to\r\nthat of the _cosines_ of the two EXTREMES DISJUNCT.\"\r\n\r\nAnd to aid our recollection in which case the tangents, and in which\r\nthe cosines are to be used, preserving the original designations of the\r\ninventor, we may observe that the _tangent_ belongs to the _conjunct_\r\ncase, terms of sufficient affinity to be associated in the memory; and\r\nthe sine _complement_ remains of course for the _disjunct case_; and\r\nfurther, if you please, that the initials of radius and sine, which are\r\nto be used together, are alphabetical consecutives.\r\n\r\nLord Napier's rule may also be used for the solution of oblique spherical\r\ntriangles. For this purpose a perpendicular must be let fall from an\r\nangle of the given triangle internally on the base, forming it into two\r\nright-angled triangles, one of which may contain two of the data. Or, if\r\nthis cannot be done, then letting it fall externally on the prolongation\r\nof the base, so as to form a right-angled triangle comprehending the\r\noblique one, wherein two of the data will be common to both. To secure\r\ntwo of the data from mutilation, this perpendicular must always be let\r\nfall from the end of a given side, and opposite to a given angle.\r\n\r\nBut there will remain yet two cases wherein Lord Napier's rule cannot\r\nbe used, to wit, where all the sides, or all the angles alone are given.\r\nTo meet these two cases, Lord Buchan and Dr. Minto devised an analogous\r\nrule. They considered the sides themselves, and the supplements of the\r\nangles as circular parts in these cases; and, dropping a perpendicular\r\nfrom any angle from which it would fall internally on the opposite side,\r\nthey assumed that angle, or that side, as the MIDDLE part, and the other\r\nangles, or other sides, as the OPPOSITE or EXTREME parts, disjunct in\r\nboth cases. Then \"the rectangle under the tangents of half the sum, and\r\nhalf the difference of the segments of the MIDDLE part, is equal to the\r\nrectangle under the tangents of half the sums, and half the difference\r\nof the OPPOSITE PARTS.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, since every plane triangle may be considered as described on the\r\nsurface of a sphere of an infinite radius, these two rules may be applied\r\nto plane right-angled triangles, and through them to the oblique. But\r\nas Lord Napier's rule gives a direct solution only in the case of two\r\nsides, and an uncomprised angle, one, two, or three operations, with\r\nthis combination of parts, may be necessary to get at that required.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: Triangular rule]\r\n\r\nYou likewise requested for the use of your school, an explanation of a\r\nmethod of platting the courses of a survey, which I mentioned to you as\r\nof my own practice. This is so obvious and simple, that as it occurred\r\nto myself, so I presume it has to others, although I have not seen\r\nit stated in any of the books. For drawing parallel lines, I use the\r\ntriangular rule, the hypothenusal side of which being applied to the\r\nside of a common straight rule, the triangle slides on that, as thus,\r\nalways parallel to itself. Instead of drawing meridians on his paper,\r\nlet the pupil draw a parallel of latitude, or east and west line, and\r\nnote in that a point for his first station, then applying to it his\r\nprotractor, lay off the first course and distance in the usual way to\r\nascertain his second station. For the second course, lay the triangular\r\nrule to the east and west line, or first parallel, holding the straight\r\nor guide rule firmly against its hypothenusal side. Then slide up the\r\ntriangle (for a northerly course) to the point of his second station,\r\nand pressing it firmly there, lay the protractor to that, and mark off\r\nthe second course, and distance as before, for the third station. Then\r\nlay the triangle to the first parallel again, and sliding it as before\r\nto the point of the third station, there apply to it the protractor for\r\nthe third course and distance, which gives the fourth station; and so\r\non. Where a course is southwardly, lay the protractor, as before, to\r\nthe northern edge of the triangle, but prick its reversed course, which\r\nreversed again in drawing, gives the true course. When the station has\r\ngot so far from the first parallel, as to be out of the reach of the\r\nparallel rule sliding on its hypothenuse, another parallel must be drawn\r\nby laying the edge, or longer leg of the triangle to the first parallel\r\nas before, applying the guide-rule to the end, or short leg, (instead\r\nof the hypothenuse,) as in the margin, and sliding the triangle up to\r\nthe point for the new parallel. I have found this, in practice, the\r\nquickest and most correct method of platting which I have ever tried,\r\nand the neatest also, because it disfigures the paper with the fewest\r\nunnecessary lines.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Angle]\r\n\r\nIf these mathematical trifles can give any facilities to your pupils,\r\nthey may in their hands become matters of use, as in mine they have been\r\nof amusement only.\r\n\r\nEver and respectfully yours.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. DUFIEF.\r\n\r\nMONTICELLO, April 19, 1814.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of the 6th instant is just received, and I shall\r\nwith equal willingness and truth, state the degree of agency you had,\r\nrespecting the copy of M. de Becourt's book, which came to my hands.\r\nThat gentleman informed me, by letter, that he was about to publish a\r\nvolume in French, \"Sur la Création du Monde, un Systême d'Organisation\r\nPrimitive,\" which, its title promised to be, either a geological or\r\nastronomical work. I subscribed; and, when published, he sent me a copy;\r\nand as you were my correspondent in the book line in Philadelphia, I\r\ntook the liberty of desiring him to call on you for the price, which, he\r\nafterwards informed me, you were so kind as to pay him for me, being,\r\nI believe, two dollars. But the sole copy which came to me was from\r\nhimself directly, and, as far as I know, was never seen by you.\r\n\r\nI am really mortified to be told that, _in the United States of America_,\r\na fact like this can become a subject of inquiry, and of criminal\r\ninquiry too, as an offence against religion; that a question about the\r\nsale of a book can be carried before the civil magistrate. Is this then\r\nour freedom of religion? and are we to have a censor whose imprimatur\r\nshall say what books may be sold, and what we may buy? And who is thus\r\nto dogmatize religious opinions for our citizens? Whose foot is to be\r\nthe measure to which ours are all to be cut or stretched? Is a priest to\r\nbe our inquisitor, or shall a layman, simple as ourselves, set up his\r\nreason as the rule for what we are to read, and what we must believe?\r\nIt is an insult to our citizens to question whether they are rational\r\nbeings or not, and blasphemy against religion to suppose it cannot stand\r\nthe test of truth and reason. If M. de Becourt's book be false in its\r\nfacts, disprove them; if false in its reasoning, refute it. But, for\r\nGod's sake, let us freely hear both sides, if we choose. I know little\r\nof its contents, having barely glanced over here and there a passage,\r\nand over the table of contents. From this, the Newtonian philosophy\r\nseemed the chief object of attack, the issue of which might be trusted\r\nto the strength of the two combatants; Newton certainly not needing the\r\nauxiliary arm of the government, and still less the holy author of our\r\nreligion, as to what in it concerns him. I thought the work would be\r\nvery innocent, and one which might be confided to the reason of any man;\r\nnot likely to be much read if let alone, but, if persecuted, it will\r\nbe generally read. Every man in the United States will think it a duty\r\nto buy a copy, in vindication of his right to buy, and to read what he\r\npleases. I have been just reading the new constitution of Spain. One of\r\nits fundamental basis is expressed in these words: \"The _Roman Catholic_\r\nreligion, the only true one, is, and always shall be, that of the Spanish\r\nnation. The government protects it by wise and just laws, and prohibits\r\nthe exercise of any other whatever.\" Now I wish this presented to those\r\nwho question what you may sell, or we may buy, with a request to strike\r\nout the words, \"Roman Catholic,\" and to insert the denomination of their\r\nown religion. This would ascertain the code of dogmas which each wishes\r\nshould domineer over the opinions of all others, and be taken, like the\r\nSpanish religion, under the \"protection of wise and just laws.\" It would\r\nshew to what they wish to reduce the liberty for which one generation has\r\nsacrificed life and happiness. It would present our boasted freedom of\r\nreligion as a thing of theory only, and not of practice, as what would\r\nbe a poor exchange for the theoretic thraldom, but practical freedom of\r\nEurope. But it is impossible that the laws of Pennsylvania, which set\r\nus the first example of the wholesome and happy effects of religious\r\nfreedom, can permit the inquisitorial functions to be proposed to their\r\ncourts. Under them you are surely safe.\r\n\r\nAt the date of yours of the 6th, you had not received mine of the 3d\r\ninst., asking a copy of an edition of Newton's Principia, which I had\r\nseen advertised. When the cost of that shall be known, it shall be added\r\nto the balance of $4.93, and incorporated with a larger remittance I\r\nhave to make to Philadelphia. Accept the assurance of my great esteem\r\nand respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO LE CHEVALIER DE ONIS.\r\n\r\n                                                MONTICELLO, April 28, 1814.\r\n\r\nI thank you, Sir, for the copy of the new constitution of Spain which\r\nyou have been so kind as to send me; and I sincerely congratulate\r\nyourself and the Spanish nation on this great stride towards political\r\nhappiness. The invasion of Spain has been the most unprecedented and\r\nunprincipled of the transactions of modern times. The crimes of its\r\nenemies, the licentiousness of its associates in defence, the exertions\r\nand sufferings of its inhabitants under slaughter and famine, and its\r\nconsequent depopulation, will mark indelibly the baneful ascendancy of\r\nthe tyrants of the sea and continent, and characterize with blood and\r\nwretchedness the age in which they have lived. Yet these sufferings of\r\nSpain will be remunerated, her population restored and increased, under\r\nthe auspices and protection of this new constitution; and the miseries\r\nof the present generation will be the price, and even the cheap price\r\nof the prosperity of endless generations to come.\r\n\r\nThere are parts of this constitution, however, in which you would expect\r\nof course that we should not concur. One of these is the intolerance\r\nof all but the Catholic religion; and no security provided against the\r\nre-establishment of an Inquisition, the exclusive judge of Catholic\r\nopinions, and authorized to proscribe and punish those it shall deem\r\nanti-Catholic. Secondly, the aristocracy, _quater sublimata_, of her\r\nlegislators; for the ultimate electors of these will themselves have been\r\nthree times sifted from the mass of the people, and may choose from the\r\nnation at large persons never named by any of the electoral bodies. But\r\nthere is one provision which will immortalize its inventors. It is that\r\nwhich, after a certain epoch, disfranchises every citizen who cannot read\r\nand write. This is new, and is the fruitful germ of the improvement of\r\neverything good, and the correction of everything imperfect in the present\r\nconstitution. This will give you an enlightened people, and an energetic\r\npublic opinion which will control and enchain the aristocratic spirit of\r\nthe government. On the whole I hail your country as now likely to resume\r\nand surpass its ancient splendor among nations. This might perhaps have\r\nbeen better secured by a just confidence in the self-sufficient strength\r\nof the peninsula itself; everything without its limits being its weakness\r\nnot its force. If the mother country has not the magnanimity to part\r\nwith the colonies in friendship, thereby making them, what they would\r\ncertainly be, her natural and firmest allies, these will emancipate\r\nthemselves, after exhausting her strength and resources in ineffectual\r\nefforts to hold them in subjection. They will be rendered enemies of the\r\nmother country, as England has rendered us by an unremitting course of\r\ninsulting injuries and silly provocations. I do not say this from the\r\nimpulse of national interest, for I do not know that the United States\r\nwould find an interest in the independence of neighbor nations, whose\r\nproduce and commerce would rivalize ours. It could only be that kind of\r\ninterest which every human being has in the happiness and prosperity of\r\nevery other. But putting right and reason out of the question, I have\r\nno doubt that on calculations of interest alone, it is that of Spain to\r\nanticipate voluntarily, and as a matter of grace, the independence of\r\nher colonies, which otherwise necessity will enforce.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. DELAPLAINE.\r\n\r\n                                                   MONTICELLO, May 3, 1814.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your favors of April 16 and 19, on the subject of the portraits\r\nof Columbus and Americus Vespucius were received on the 30th. While I\r\nresided at Paris, knowing that these portraits and those of some other of\r\nthe early American worthies were in the gallery of Medicis at Florence,\r\nI took measures for engaging a good artist to take and send me copies of\r\nthem. I considered it as even of some public concern that our country\r\nshould not be without the portraits of its first discoverers. These\r\ncopies have already run the risks of transportations from Florence to\r\nParis, to Philadelphia, to Washington, and lastly to this place, where\r\nthey are at length safely deposited. You request me \"to forward them\r\nto you at Philadelphia for the purpose of having engravings taken from\r\nthem for a work you propose to publish, and you pledge your honor that\r\nthey shall be restored to me in perfect safety.\" I have no doubt of\r\nthe sincerity of your intentions in this pledge; and that it would be\r\ncomplied with as far as it would be in your power. But the injuries and\r\naccidents of their transportation to Philadelphia and back again are\r\nnot within your control. Besides the rubbing through a land carriage of\r\nsix hundred miles, a carriage may overset in a river or creek, or be\r\ncrashed with everything in it. The frequency of such accidents to the\r\nstages renders all insurance against them impossible. And were they to\r\nescape the perils of this journey I should be liable to the same calls,\r\nand they to the same or greater hazards from all those in other parts of\r\nthe continent who should propose to publish any work in which they might\r\nwish to employ engravings of the same characters. From public, therefore,\r\nas well as private considerations, I think that these portraits ought\r\nnot to be hazarded from their present deposit. Like public records, I\r\nmake them free to be copied, but, being as originals in this country,\r\nthey should not be exposed to the accidents or injuries of travelling\r\npost. While I regret, therefore, the necessity of declining to comply\r\nwith your request, I freely and with pleasure offer to receive as a\r\nguest any artist whom you shall think proper to engage, and will make\r\nthem welcome to take copies at their leisure for your use. I wish them\r\nto be multiplied for safe preservation, and consider them as worthy a\r\nplace in every collection. Indeed I do not know how it happened that Mr.\r\nPeale did not think of copying them while they were in Philadelphia;\r\nand I think it not impossible that either the father or the son might\r\nnow undertake the journey for the use of their museum. On the ground of\r\nour personal esteem for them, they would be at home in my family.\r\n\r\nWhen I received these portraits at Paris, Mr. Daniel Parker of\r\nMassachusetts happened to be there, and determined to procure for himself\r\ncopies from the same originals at Florence; and I think he did obtain\r\nthem, and that I have heard of their being in the hands of some one\r\nin Boston. If so, it might perhaps be easier to get some artist there\r\nto take and send you copies. But be this as it may, you are perfectly\r\nwelcome to the benefit of mine in the way I have mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe two original portraits of myself taken by Mr. Stewart, after which\r\nyou enquire, are both in his possession at Boston. One of them only is\r\nmy property. The President has a copy from that which Stewart considered\r\nas the best of the two; but I believe it is at his seat in his State.\r\n\r\nI thank you for the print of Dr. Rush. He was one of my early and\r\nintimate friends, and among the best of men. The engraving is excellent\r\nas is everything from the hand of Mr. Edwin. Accept the assurance of my\r\nrespect, and good wishes for the success of your work.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. JOHN F. WATSON.\r\n\r\n                                                  MONTICELLO, May 17, 1814.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have long been a subscriber to the edition of the Edinburgh\r\nReview first published by Mr. Sargeant, and latterly by Eastburn, Kirk\r\n& Co., and already possess from No. 30 to 42 inclusive; except that Nos.\r\n31 and 37 never came to hand. These two and No. 29, I should be glad to\r\nreceive, with all subsequently published, through the channel of Messrs.\r\nFitzwhylson & Potter of Richmond, with whom I originally subscribed,\r\nand to whom it is more convenient to make payment by a standing order\r\non my correspondent at Richmond. I willingly also subscribe for the\r\nrepublication of the first twenty-eight numbers to be furnished me through\r\nthe same channel, for the convenience of payment. This work is certainly\r\nunrivalled in merit, and if continued by the same talents, information\r\nand principles which distinguish it in every department of science\r\nwhich it reviews, it will become a real Encyclopedia, justly taking its\r\nstation in our libraries with the most valuable depositories of human\r\nknowledge. Of the Quarterly Review I have not seen many numbers. As the\r\nantagonist of the other it appears to me a pigmy against a giant. The\r\nprecept \"audi alteram partem,\" on which it is republished here, should be\r\nsacred with the judge who is to decide between the contending claims of\r\nindividual and individual. It is well enough for the young who have yet\r\nopinions to make up in questions of principle in ethics or politics. But\r\nto those who have gone through this process with industry, reflection,\r\nand singleness of heart, who have formed their conclusions and acted\r\non them through life, to be reading over and over again what they have\r\nalready read, considered and condemned, is an idle waste of time. It\r\nis not in the history of modern England or among the advocates of the\r\nprinciples or practices of her government, that the friend of freedom,\r\nor of political morality, is to seek instruction. There has indeed been\r\na period, during which both were to be found, not in her government, but\r\nin the band of worthies who so boldly and ably reclaimed the rights of\r\nthe people, and wrested from their government theoretic acknowledgments\r\nof them. This period began with the Stuarts, and continued but one reign\r\nafter them. Since that, the vital principle of the English constitution\r\nis _corruption_, its practices the natural results of that principle, and\r\ntheir consequences a pampered aristocracy, annihilation of the substantial\r\nmiddle class, a degraded populace, oppressive taxes, general pauperism,\r\nand national bankruptcy. Those who long for these blessings here will\r\nfind their generating principles well developed and advocated by the\r\nantagonist of the Edinburgh Review. Still those who doubt should read\r\nthem; every man's reason being his own rightful umpire. This principle,\r\nwith that of acquiescence in the will of the majority will preserve us\r\nfree and prosperous as long as they are sacredly observed. Accept the\r\nassurances of my respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. ABRAHAM SMALL.\r\n\r\n                                                  MONTICELLO, May 20, 1814.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I thank you for the copy of the American Speaker which you have\r\nbeen so kind as to send me. It is a judicious selection of what has been\r\nexcellently spoken on both sides of the Atlantic; and according to your\r\nrequest, I willingly add some suggestions, should another edition be\r\ncalled for. To the speeches of Lord Chatham might be added his reply to\r\nHorace Walpole, on the Seamen's bill, in the House of Commons, in 1740,\r\none of the severest which history has recorded. Indeed, the subsequent\r\nspeeches in order, to which that reply gave rise being few, short and\r\npithy, well merit insertion in such a collection as this. They are in\r\nthe twelfth volume of Chandler's Debates of the House of Commons. But\r\nthe finest thing, in my opinion, which the English language has produced,\r\nis the defence of Eugene Aram, spoken by himself at the bar of the York\r\nassizes, in 1759, on a charge of murder, and to be found in the Annual\r\nRegister of that date, or a little after. It had been upwards of fifty\r\nyears since I had read it, when the receipt of your letter induced me\r\nto look up a MS. copy I had preserved, and on re-perusal at this age\r\nand distance of time, it loses nothing of its high station in my mind\r\nfor classical style, close logic, and strong representation. I send you\r\nthis copy which was taken for me by a school-boy, replete with errors\r\nof punctuation, of orthography, and sometimes substitutions of one word\r\nfor another. It would be better to recur to the Annual Register itself\r\nfor correctness, where also I think are stated the circumstances and\r\nissue of the case. To these I would add the short, the nervous, the\r\nunanswerable speech of Carnot, in 1803, on the proposition to declare\r\nBonaparte consul for life. This creed of republicanism should be well\r\ntranslated, and placed in the hands and heart of every friend to the\r\nrights of self-government. I consider these speeches of Aram and Carnot,\r\nand that of Logan, inserted in your collection, as worthily standing in\r\na line with those of Scipio and Hannibal in Livy, and of Cato and Cæsar\r\nin Sallust. On examining the Indian speeches in my possession, I find\r\nnone which are not already in your collection, except that my copy of\r\nthe corn-planter's has much in it which yours has not. But observing\r\nthat the omissions relate to special subjects only, I presume they are\r\nmade purposely and indeed properly.\r\n\r\nI must add more particular thanks for the kind expressions of your letter\r\ntowards myself. These testimonies of approbation from my fellow-citizens,\r\noffered too when the lapse of time may have cooled and matured their\r\nopinions, are an ample reward for such services as I have been able to\r\nrender them, and are peculiarly gratifying in a state of retirement and\r\nreflection. I pray you to accept the assurance of my respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THOMAS LAW, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                              POPLAR FOREST, June 13, 1814.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--The copy of your Second Thoughts on Instinctive Impulses,\r\nwith the letter accompanying it, was received just as I was setting out\r\non a journey to this place, two or three days' distant from Monticello.\r\nI brought it with me and read it with great satisfaction, and with the\r\nmore as it contained exactly my own creed on the foundation of morality\r\nin man. It is really curious that on a question so fundamental, such\r\na variety of opinions should have prevailed among men, and those, too,\r\nof the most exemplary virtue and first order of understanding. It shows\r\nhow necessary was the care of the Creator in making the moral principle\r\nso much a part of our constitution as that no errors of reasoning or\r\nof speculation might lead us astray from its observance in practice. Of\r\nall the theories on this question, the most whimsical seems to have been\r\nthat of Wollaston, who considers _truth_ as the foundation of morality.\r\nThe thief who steals your guinea does wrong only inasmuch as he acts\r\na lie in using your guinea as if it were his own. Truth is certainly a\r\nbranch of morality, and a very important one to society. But presented\r\nas its foundation, it is as if a tree taken up by the roots, had its\r\nstem reversed in the air, and one of its branches planted in the ground.\r\nSome have made the _love of God_ the foundation of morality. This,\r\ntoo, is but a branch of our moral duties, which are generally divided\r\ninto duties to God and duties to man. If we did a good act merely from\r\nthe love of God and a belief that it is pleasing to Him, whence arises\r\nthe morality of the Atheist? It is idle to say, as some do, that no\r\nsuch being exists. We have the same evidence of the fact as of most of\r\nthose we act on, to-wit: their own affirmations, and their reasonings\r\nin support of them. I have observed, indeed, generally, that while in\r\nprotestant countries the defections from the Platonic Christianity of\r\nthe priests is to Deism, in catholic countries they are to Atheism.\r\nDiderot, D'Alembert, D'Holbach, Condorcet, are known to have been among\r\nthe most virtuous of men. Their virtue, then, must have had some other\r\nfoundation than the love of God.\r\n\r\nThe Το καλον of others is founded in a different faculty, that of taste,\r\nwhich is not even a branch of morality. We have indeed an innate sense\r\nof what we call beautiful, but that is exercised chiefly on subjects\r\naddressed to the fancy, whether through the eye in visible forms, as\r\nlandscape, animal figure, dress, drapery, architecture, the composition\r\nof colors, &c., or to the imagination directly, as imagery, style, or\r\nmeasure in prose or poetry, or whatever else constitutes the domain\r\nof criticism or taste, a faculty entirely distinct from the moral one.\r\nSelf-interest, or rather self-love, or _egoism_, has been more plausibly\r\nsubstituted as the basis of morality. But I consider our relations with\r\nothers as constituting the boundaries of morality. With ourselves we\r\nstand on the ground of identity, not of relation, which last, requiring\r\ntwo subjects, excludes self-love confined to a single one. To ourselves,\r\nin strict language, we can owe no duties, obligation requiring also\r\ntwo parties. Self-love, therefore, is no part of morality. Indeed it is\r\nexactly its counterpart. It is the sole antagonist of virtue, leading us\r\nconstantly by our propensities to self-gratification in violation of our\r\nmoral duties to others. Accordingly, it is against this enemy that are\r\nerected the batteries of moralists and religionists, as the only obstacle\r\nto the practice of morality. Take from man his selfish propensities,\r\nand he can have nothing to seduce him from the practice of virtue. Or\r\nsubdue those propensities by education, instruction or restraint, and\r\nvirtue remains without a competitor. Egoism, in a broader sense, has\r\nbeen thus presented as the source of moral action. It has been said\r\nthat we feed the hungry, clothe the naked, bind up the wounds of the\r\nman beaten by thieves, pour oil and wine into them, set him on our own\r\nbeast and bring him to the inn, because we receive ourselves pleasure\r\nfrom these acts. So Helvetius, one of the best men on earth, and the\r\nmost ingenious advocate of this principle, after defining \"interest\"\r\nto mean not merely that which is pecuniary, but whatever may procure us\r\npleasure or withdraw us from pain, [_de l'esprit_ 2, 1,] says, [ib. 2, 2,]\r\n\"the humane man is he to whom the sight of misfortune is insupportable,\r\nand who to rescue himself from this spectacle, is forced to succor the\r\nunfortunate object.\" This indeed is true. But it is one step short of\r\nthe ultimate question. These good acts give us pleasure, but how happens\r\nit that they give us pleasure? Because nature hath implanted in our\r\nbreasts a love of others, a sense of duty to them, a moral instinct,\r\nin short, which prompts us irresistibly to feel and to succor their\r\ndistresses, and protests against the language of Helvetius, [ib. 2, 5,]\r\n\"what other motive than self-interest could determine a man to generous\r\nactions? It is as impossible for him to love what is good for the sake\r\nof good, as to love evil for the sake of evil.\" The Creator would indeed\r\nhave been a bungling artist, had he intended man for a social animal,\r\nwithout planting in him social dispositions. It is true they are not\r\nplanted in every man, because there is no rule without exceptions; but\r\nit is false reasoning which converts exceptions into the general rule.\r\nSome men are born without the organs of sight, or of hearing, or without\r\nhands. Yet it would be wrong to say that man is born without these\r\nfaculties, and sight, hearing, and hands may with truth enter into the\r\ngeneral definition of man. The want or imperfection of the moral sense\r\nin some men, like the want or imperfection of the senses of sight and\r\nhearing in others, is no proof that it is a general characteristic of\r\nthe species. When it is wanting, we endeavor to supply the defect by\r\neducation, by appeals to reason and calculation, by presenting to the\r\nbeing so unhappily conformed, other motives to do good and to eschew\r\nevil, such as the love, or the hatred, or rejection of those among whom\r\nhe lives, and whose society is necessary to his happiness and even\r\nexistence; demonstrations by sound calculation that honesty promotes\r\ninterest in the long run; the rewards and penalties established by the\r\nlaws; and ultimately the prospects of a future state of retribution for\r\nthe evil as well as the good done while here. These are the correctives\r\nwhich are supplied by education, and which exercise the functions of\r\nthe moralist, the preacher, and legislator; and they lead into a course\r\nof correct action all those whose disparity is not too profound to be\r\neradicated. Some have argued against the existence of a moral sense,\r\nby saying that if nature had given us such a sense, impelling us to\r\nvirtuous actions, and warning us against those which are vicious, then\r\nnature would also have designated, by some particular ear-marks, the\r\ntwo sets of actions which are, in themselves, the one virtuous and the\r\nother vicious. Whereas, we find, in fact, that the same actions are\r\ndeemed virtuous in one country and vicious in another. The answer is\r\nthat nature has constituted _utility_ to man the standard and best of\r\nvirtue. Men living in different countries, under different circumstances,\r\ndifferent habits and regimens, may have different utilities; the same\r\nact, therefore, may be useful, and consequently virtuous in one country\r\nwhich is injurious and vicious in another differently circumstanced. I\r\nsincerely, then, believe with you in the general existence of a moral\r\ninstinct. I think it the brightest gem with which the human character is\r\nstudded, and the want of it as more degrading than the most hideous of\r\nthe bodily deformities. I am happy in reviewing the roll of associates in\r\nthis principle which you present in your second letter, some of which I\r\nhad not before met with. To these might be added Lord Kaims, one of the\r\nablest of our advocates, who goes so far as to say, in his Principles\r\nof Natural Religion, that a man owes no duty to which he is not urged by\r\nsome impulsive feeling. This is correct, if referred to the standard of\r\ngeneral feeling in the given case, and not to the feeling of a single\r\nindividual. Perhaps I may misquote him, it being fifty years since I\r\nread his book.\r\n\r\nThe leisure and solitude of my situation here has led me to the\r\nindiscretion of taxing you with a long letter on a subject whereon\r\nnothing new can be offered you. I will indulge myself no farther than\r\nto repeat the assurances of my continued esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n                                                  MONTICELLO, July 5, 1814.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Since mine of January the 24th, yours of March the 14th has\r\nbeen received. It was not acknowledged in the short one of May the 18th,\r\nby Mr. Rives, the only object of that having been to enable one of our\r\nmost promising young men to have the advantage of making his bow to you.\r\nI learned with great regret the serious illness mentioned in your letter;\r\nand I hope Mr. Rives will be able to tell me you are entirely restored.\r\nBut our machines have now been running seventy or eighty years, and we\r\nmust expect that, worn as they are, here a pivot, there a wheel, now\r\na pinion, next a spring, will be giving way; and however we may tinker\r\nthem up for awhile, all will at length surcease motion. Our watches, with\r\nworks of brass and steel, wear out within that period. Shall you and I\r\nlast to see the course the seven-fold wonders of the times will take?\r\nThe Attila of the age dethroned, the ruthless destroyer of ten millions\r\nof the human race, whose thirst for blood appeared unquenchable, the\r\ngreat oppressor of the rights and liberties of the world, shut up within\r\nthe circle of a little island of the Mediterranean, and dwindled to the\r\ncondition of an humble and degraded pensioner on the bounty of those he\r\nhad most injured. How miserably, how meanly, has he closed his inflated\r\ncareer! What a sample of the bathos will his history present! He should\r\nhave perished on the swords of his enemies, under the walls of Paris.\r\n\r\n     \"Leon piagato a morte\r\n     Sente mancar la vita,\r\n     Guarda la sua ferita,\r\n     Ne s'avilisce ancor.\r\n     Cosi fra l'ire estrema\r\n     Rugge, minaccia, e freme,\r\n     Che fa tremar morendo\r\n     Tal volta il cacciator.\"--Metast. Adriano.\r\n\r\nBut Bonaparte was a lion in the field only. In civil life, a cold-blooded,\r\ncalculating, unprincipled usurper, without a virtue; no statesman,\r\nknowing nothing of commerce, political economy, or civil government, and\r\nsupplying ignorance by bold presumption. I had supposed him a great man\r\nuntil his entrance into the Assembly _des cinq cens_, eighteen Brumaire\r\n(an. 8.) From that date, however, I set him down as a great scoundrel\r\nonly. To the wonders of his rise and fall, we may add that of a Czar of\r\nMuscovy, dictating, _in Paris_, laws and limits to all the successors of\r\nthe Cæsars, and holding even the balance in which the fortunes of this\r\nnew world are suspended. I own, that while I rejoice, for the good of\r\nmankind, in the deliverance of Europe from the havoc which would never\r\nhave ceased while Bonaparte should have lived in power, I see with anxiety\r\nthe tyrant of the ocean remaining in vigor, and even participating in the\r\nmerit of crushing his brother tyrant. While the world is thus turned up\r\nside down, on which of its sides are we? All the strong reasons, indeed,\r\nplace us on the side of peace; the interests of the continent, their\r\nfriendly dispositions, and even the interests of England. Her passions\r\nalone are opposed to it. Peace would seem now to be an easy work, the\r\ncauses of the war being removed. Her orders of council will no doubt be\r\ntaken care of by the allied powers, and, war ceasing, her impressment\r\nof our seamen ceases of course. But I fear there is foundation for the\r\ndesign intimated in the public papers, of demanding a cession of our\r\nright in the fisheries. What will Massachusetts say to this? I mean her\r\nmajority, which must be considered as speaking through the organs it has\r\nappointed itself, as the index of its will. She chooses to sacrifice the\r\nliberties of our seafaring citizens, in which we were all interested,\r\nand with them her obligations to the co-States, rather than war with\r\nEngland. Will she now sacrifice the fisheries to the same partialities?\r\nThis question is interesting to her alone; for to the middle, the\r\nsouthern and western States, they are of no direct concern; of no more\r\nthan the culture of tobacco, rice and cotton, to Massachusetts. I am\r\nreally at a loss to conjecture what our refractory sister will say on\r\nthis occasion. I know what, as a citizen of the Union, I would say to\r\nher. \"Take this question _ad referendum_. It concerns you alone. If you\r\nwould rather give up the fisheries than war with England, we give them\r\nup. If you had rather fight for them, we will defend your interests to\r\nthe last drop of our blood, choosing rather to set a good example than\r\nfollow a bad one.\" And I hope she will determine to fight for them. With\r\nthis, however, you and I shall have nothing to do; ours being truly the\r\ncase wherein \"_non tali auxilio, nec defensoribus istis tempus eget_.\"\r\nQuitting this subject, therefore I will turn over another leaf.\r\n\r\nI am just returned from one of my long absences, having been at my other\r\nhome for five weeks past. Having more leisure there than here for reading,\r\nI amused myself with reading seriously Plato's Republic. I am wrong,\r\nhowever, in calling it amusement, for it was the heaviest task-work I\r\never went through. I had occasionally before taken up some of his other\r\nworks, but scarcely ever had patience to go through a whole dialogue.\r\nWhile wading through the whimsies, the puerilities, and unintelligible\r\njargon of this work, I laid it down often to ask myself how it could have\r\nbeen, that the world should have so long consented to give reputation\r\nto such nonsense as this? How the _soi-disant_ Christian world, indeed,\r\nshould have done it, is a piece of historical curiosity. But how could\r\nthe Roman good sense do it? And particularly, how could Cicero bestow\r\nsuch eulogies on Plato? Although Cicero did not wield the dense logic\r\nof Demosthenes, yet he was able, learned, laborious, practised in the\r\nbusiness of the world, and honest. He could not be the dupe of mere style,\r\nof which he was himself the first master in the world. With the moderns,\r\nI think, it is rather a matter of fashion and authority. Education is\r\nchiefly in the hands of persons who, from their profession, have an\r\ninterest in the reputation and the dreams of Plato. They give the tone\r\nwhile at school, and few in their after years have occasion to revise\r\ntheir college opinions. But fashion and authority apart, and bringing\r\nPlato to the test of reason, take from him his sophisms, futilities\r\nand incomprehensibilities, and what remains? In truth, he is one of the\r\nrace of genuine sophists, who has escaped the oblivion of his brethren,\r\nfirst, by the elegance of his diction, but chiefly, by the adoption and\r\nincorporation of his whimsies into the body of artificial Christianity.\r\nHis foggy mind is forever presenting the semblances of objects which,\r\nhalf seen through a mist, can be defined neither in form nor dimensions.\r\nYet this, which should have consigned him to early oblivion, really\r\nprocured him immortality of fame and reverence. The Christian priesthood,\r\nfinding the doctrines of Christ levelled to every understanding, and too\r\nplain to need explanation, saw in the mysticism of Plato materials with\r\nwhich they might build up an artificial system, which might, from its\r\nindistinctness, admit everlasting controversy, give employment for their\r\norder, and introduce it to profit, power and pre-eminence. The doctrines\r\nwhich flowed from the lips of Jesus himself are within the comprehension\r\nof a child; but thousands of volumes have not yet explained the Platonisms\r\nengrafted on them; and for this obvious reason, that nonsense can never\r\nbe explained. Their purposes, however, are answered. Plato is canonized;\r\nand it is now deemed as impious to question his merits as those of an\r\nApostle of Jesus. He is peculiarly appealed to as an advocate of the\r\nimmortality of the soul; and yet I will venture to say, that were there\r\nno better arguments than his in proof of it, not a man in the world\r\nwould believe it. It is fortunate for us, that Platonic republicanism\r\nhas not obtained the same favor as Platonic Christianity; or we should\r\nnow have been all living, men, women and children, pell mell together,\r\nlike beasts of the field or forest. Yet \"Plato is a great philosopher,\"\r\nsaid La Fontaine. But, says Fontenelle, \"do you find his ideas very\r\nclear?\" \"Oh no! he is of an obscurity impenetrable.\" \"Do you not find\r\nhim full of contradictions?\" \"Certainly,\" replied La Fontaine, \"he is\r\nbut a sophist.\" Yet immediately after, he exclaims again, \"Oh, Plato was\r\na great philosopher.\" Socrates had reason, indeed, to complain of the\r\nmisrepresentations of Plato; for in truth, his dialogues are libels on\r\nSocrates.\r\n\r\nBut why am I dosing you with these antediluvian topics? Because I am glad\r\nto have some one to whom they are familiar, and who will not receive them\r\nas if dropped from the moon. Our post-revolutionary youth are born under\r\nhappier stars than you and I were. They acquire all learning in their\r\nmother's womb, and bring it into the world ready made. The information of\r\nbooks is no longer necessary; and all knowledge which is not innate, is\r\nin contempt, or neglect at least. Every folly must run its round; and so,\r\nI suppose, must that of self-learning and self-sufficiency; of rejecting\r\nthe knowledge acquired in past ages, and starting on the new ground of\r\nintuition. When sobered by experience, I hope our successors will turn\r\ntheir attention to the advantages of education. I mean of education on\r\nthe broad scale, and not that of the petty _academies_, as they call\r\nthemselves, which are starting up in every neighborhood, and where one\r\nor two men, possessing Latin and sometimes Greek, a knowledge of the\r\nglobes, and the first six books of Euclid, imagine and communicate this\r\nas the sum of science. They commit their pupils to the theatre of the\r\nworld, with just taste enough of learning to be alienated from industrious\r\npursuits, and not enough to do service in the ranks of science. We have\r\nsome exceptions, indeed. I presented one to you lately, and we have some\r\nothers. But the terms I use are general truths. I hope the necessity\r\nwill, at length, be seen of establishing institutions here, as in Europe,\r\nwhere every branch of science, useful at this day, may be taught in its\r\nhighest degree. Have you ever turned your thoughts to the plan of such\r\nan institution? I mean to a specification of the particular sciences of\r\nreal use in human affairs, and how they might be so grouped as to require\r\nso many professors only as might bring them within the views of a just\r\nbut enlightened economy? I should be happy in a communication of your\r\nideas on this problem, either loose or digested. But to avoid my being\r\nrun away with by another subject, and adding to the length and ennui of\r\nthe present letter, I will here present to Mrs. Adams and yourself, the\r\nassurance of my constant and sincere friendship and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS TO THOMAS JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n                                                     QUINCY, July 16, 1814.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I received this morning your favor of the 5th, and as I can\r\nnever let a sheet of yours rest, I sit down immediately to acknowledge\r\nit.\r\n\r\nWhenever Mr. Reeves, of whom I have heard nothing, shall arrive, he\r\nshall receive all the cordial civilities in my power.\r\n\r\nI am sometimes afraid that my \"machine\" will not \"surcease motion\" soon\r\nenough; for I dread nothing so much as \"dying at top,\" and expiring\r\nlike Dean Swift, \"a driveler and a show;\" or like Sam Adams, a grief and\r\ndistress to his family, a weeping helpless object of compassion for years.\r\n\r\nI am bold to say, that neither you nor I will live to see the course which\r\nthe \"wonders of the times\" will take. Many years, and perhaps centuries\r\nmust pass, before the current will acquire a settled direction. If the\r\nChristian religion, as I understand it, or as you understand it, should\r\nmaintain its ground, as I believe it will, yet Platonic, Pythagonic,\r\nHindoo, Cabalistical Christianity, which is Catholic Christianity, and\r\nwhich has prevailed for 1,500 years, has received a mortal wound of\r\nwhich the monster must finally die; yet so strong is his constitution,\r\nthat he may endure for centuries before he expires.\r\n\r\nGovernment has never been much studied by mankind, but their attention\r\nhas been drawn to it in the latter part of the last century, and the\r\nbeginning of this, more than at any former period; and the vast variety of\r\nexperiments that have been made of constitutions in America, in France, in\r\nHolland, in Geneva, in Switzerland, and even in Spain and South America,\r\ncan never be forgotten. They will be catastrophes noted. The result, in\r\ntime, will be improvements; and I have no doubt that the honors we have\r\nexperienced for the last forty years, will ultimately terminate in the\r\nadvancement of civil and religious liberty, and ameliorations in the\r\ncondition of mankind; for I am a believer in the probable improvability\r\nand improvement, the ameliorability and amelioration in human affairs;\r\nthough I never could understand the doctrine of the perfectability of\r\nthe human mind. This has always appeared to me like the philosophy, or\r\ntheology of the Gentoos, viz., that a Brachman, by certain studies, for\r\na certain time pursued, and by certain ceremonies, a certain number of\r\ntimes repeated, becomes omniscient and almighty.\r\n\r\nOur hopes, however, of sudden tranquillity, ought not to be too sanguine.\r\nFanaticism and superstition will still be selfish, subtle, intriguing,\r\nand at times furious. Despotism will still struggle for domination;\r\nmonarchy will still study to rival nobility in popularity; aristocracy\r\nwill continue to envy all above it, and despise and oppress all below it;\r\ndemocracy will envy all, contend with all, endeavor to pull down all; and\r\nwhen by chance it happens to get the upper hand for a short time, it will\r\nbe revengeful, bloody, and cruel. These, and other elements of fanaticism\r\nand anarchy, will yet, for a long time, continue a fermentation, which\r\nwill excite alarms and require vigilance.\r\n\r\nNapoleon is a military fanatic like Achilles, Alexander, Cæsar, Mahomet,\r\nZingis, Kouli, Charles XII., &c. The maxim and principle of all of them\r\nwas the same: \"Jura negat sibi lata, nihil non arrogat armis.\"\r\n\r\nBut is it strict to call him an usurper? Was not his elevation to the\r\nempire of France as legitimate and authentic a national act as that of\r\nWilliam the III., or the House of Hanover to the throne of the three\r\nkingdoms? or as the election of Washington to the command of our army,\r\nor to the chair of the States?\r\n\r\nHuman nature, in no form of it, ever could bear prosperity. That peculiar\r\ntribe of men called conquerors, more remarkably than any other, have\r\nbeen swelled with vanity by any series of victories.\r\n\r\nNapoleon won so many mighty battles in such quick succession, and\r\nfor so long a time, that it was no wonder his brain became completely\r\nintoxicated, and his enterprises rash, extravagant, and mad.\r\n\r\nThough France is humbled, Britain is not. Though Bonaparte is banished,\r\na greater tyrant and miser usurper still domineers. John Bull is quite\r\nas unfeeling, as unprincipled, more powerful, has shed more blood, than\r\nBonaparte. John, by his money, his intrigues, and arms, by exciting\r\ncoalition after coalition against him, made him what he was, and, at\r\nlast, what he is. How shall the tyrant of tyrants be brought low? Aye!\r\nthere's the rub! I still think Bonaparte great, at least as any of\r\nthe conquerors. The wonders \"of his rise and fall,\" may be seen in the\r\nlife of king Theodore, or Pascal Paoli, or Mazionetti, or Jack Cade, or\r\nWat Tyler, or Rienzi, or Dionicus. The only difference is that between\r\nminiatures and full-length pictures. The schoolmaster at Corinth was\r\na greater _man_ than the tyrant of Syracuse, upon the principle that\r\nhe who conquers himself is greater than he who takes a city. Though\r\nthe ferocious roar of the wounded lion may terrify the hunter with the\r\npossibility of another dangerous leap, Bonaparte was shot dead at once\r\nby France. He could no longer roar or struggle, growl or paw; he could\r\nonly gasp the death. I wish that France may not still regret him. But\r\nthese are speculations in the clouds. I agree with you that the milk\r\nof human kindness in the Bourbons, is safer for mankind than the fierce\r\nambition of Napoleon.\r\n\r\nThe Autocrator appears in an imposing light. Fifty years ago, English\r\nwriters held up terrible consequences from \"thawing out the monstrous\r\nnorthern snake.\" If Cossacks, and Tartars, and Goths, and Vandals, and\r\nHuns, and Riparians, should get a taste of European sweets, what may\r\nhappen? Could Wellingtons or Bonapartes resist them?\r\n\r\nThe greatest trait of sagacity that Alexander has yet exhibited to\r\nthe world, is his courtship of the United States. But whether this is\r\na mature, well-digested policy, or only a transient gleam of thought,\r\nstill remains to be explained and proved by time.\r\n\r\nThe refractory siston will not give up the fisheries. Not a man here\r\ndares to hint at so base a thought.\r\n\r\nI am very glad you have seriously read Plato; and still more rejoiced to\r\nfind that your reflections upon him so perfectly harmonize with mine. Some\r\nthirty years ago I took upon me the severe task of going through all his\r\nworks. With the help of two Latin translations, and one English and one\r\nFrench translation, and comparing some of the most remarkable passages\r\nwith the Greek, I labored through the tedious toil. My disappointment\r\nwas very great, my astonishment was greater, and my disgust shocking. Two\r\nthings only did I learn from him. 1. That Franklin's ideas of exempting\r\nhusbandmen, and mariners, &c., from the depredations of war, was borrowed\r\nfrom him. 2. That sneezing is a cure for the hickups. Accordingly, I\r\nhave cured myself, and all my friends, of that provoking disorder, for\r\nthirty years, with a pinch of snuff.\r\n\r\nSome parts of some of his dialogues are entertaining like the writings\r\nof Rousseau, but his laws and his republic, from which I expected most,\r\ndisappointed me most.\r\n\r\nI could scarcely exclude the suspicion that he intended the latter as\r\na bitter satire upon all republican government, as Xenophon undoubtedly\r\ndesigned, by his essay on democracy, to ridicule that species of republic.\r\nIn a letter to the learned and ingenious Mr. Taylor, of Haslewood,\r\nI suggested to him the project of writing a novel, in which the hero\r\nshould be sent upon his travels through Plato's republic, and all his\r\nadventures, with his observations on the principles and opinions, the\r\narts and sciences, the manners, customs, and habits of the citizens,\r\nshould be recorded. Nothing can be conceived more destructive of human\r\nhappiness; more infallibly contrived to transform men and women into\r\nbrutes, Yahoos, or demons, than a community of wives and property. Yet\r\nin what are the writings of Rousseau and Helvetius, wiser than those\r\nof Plato? The man who first fenced a tobacco yard, and said this is\r\nmine, ought instantly to have been put to death, says Rousseau. The\r\nman who first pronounced the barbarous word _Dieu_, ought to have been\r\nimmediately destroyed, says Diderot. In short, philosophers, ancient and\r\nmodern, appear to me as mad as Hindoos, Mahometans, and Christians. No\r\ndoubt they would all think me mad, and, for anything I know, this globe\r\nmay be the bedlam, _Le Bicêtre_ of the universe. After all, as long as\r\nproperty exists, it will accumulate in individuals and families. As long\r\nas marriage exists, knowledge, property, and influence will accumulate\r\nin families. Your and our equal partition of intestate estates, instead\r\nof preventing, will, in time, augment the evil, if it is one.\r\n\r\nThe French revolutionists saw this, and were so far consistent. When\r\nthey burned pedigrees and genealogical trees, they annihilated, as far\r\nas they could, marriages, knowing that marriage, among a thousand other\r\nthings, was an infallible source of aristocracy. I repeat it, so sure\r\nas the idea and existence of _property_ is admitted and established in\r\nsociety, accumulations of it will be made; the snow-ball will grow as\r\nit rolls.\r\n\r\nCicero was educated in the Groves of Academus, where the name and memory\r\nof Plato were idolized to such a degree, that if he had wholly renounced\r\nthe prejudices of his education, his reputation would have been lessened,\r\nif not injured and ruined. In his two volumes of Discourses on Government,\r\nwe may presume that he fully examined Plato's laws and republic, as well\r\nas Aristotle's writings on government. But these have been carefully\r\ndestroyed, not improbably with the general consent of philosophers,\r\npoliticians and priests. The loss is as much to be regretted as that of\r\nany production of antiquity.\r\n\r\nNothing seizes the attention of the staring animal so surely as paradox,\r\nriddle, mystery, invention, discovery, wonder, temerity. Plato and\r\nhis disciples, from the fourth-century Christians to Rousseau and Tom\r\nPaine, have been fully sensible of this weakness in mankind, and have\r\ntoo successfully grounded upon it their pretensions to fame.\r\n\r\nI might, indeed, have mentioned Bolingbroke, Hume, Gibbon, Voltaire,\r\nTurgot, Helvetius, Diderot, Condorcet, Buffon, and fifty others, all a\r\nlittle cracked. Be to their faults a little blind, to their virtues ever\r\nkind.\r\n\r\nEducation! Oh Education! The greatest grief of my heart, and the greatest\r\naffliction of my life! To my mortification I must confess that I have\r\nnever closely thought, or very deliberately reflected upon the subject\r\nwhich never occurs to me now without producing a deep sigh, a heavy\r\ngroan, and sometimes tears.\r\n\r\nMy cruel destiny separated me from my children, almost continually\r\nfrom their birth to their manhood. I was compelled to leave them to\r\nthe ordinary routine of reading, writing and Latin school, academy and\r\ncollege. John, alone, was much with me, and he but occasionally. If I\r\nventure to give you any thoughts at all, they must be very crude. I have\r\nturned over Locke, Milton, Condilac, Rousseau, and even Miss Edgeworth,\r\nas a bird flies through the air. The Preceptor I have thought a good book.\r\n\r\nGrammar, rhetoric, logic, ethics, mathematics, cannot be neglected.\r\nClassics, in spite of our friend Rush, I must think indispensable.\r\nNatural history, mechanics and experimental philosophy, chemistry, &c.,\r\nat least their rudiments, cannot be forgotten. Geography, astronomy,\r\nand even history and chronology, (although I am myself afflicted with\r\na kind of Pyrrhonism in the two latter,) I presume cannot be omitted.\r\nTheology I would leave to Ray, Derham, Nicuentent, and Paley, rather\r\nthan to Luther, Zinzindorf, Swedenborg, Wesley or Whitefield, or Thomas\r\nAquinas or Wollebius. Metaphysics I would leave in the clouds with the\r\nmaterialists and spiritualists, with Leibnitz, Berkley, Priestley and\r\nEdwards, and I might add Hume and Reed, or if permitted to be read, it\r\nshould be with romances and novels. What shall I say of music, drawing,\r\nfencing, dancing and gymnastic exercises? What of languages, oriental\r\nand occidental? Of French, Italian, German or Russian? of Sanscrit or\r\nChinese?\r\n\r\nThe task you have prescribed to me of grouping these sciences or arts\r\nunder professors, within the views of an enlightened economy, is far\r\nbeyond my forces. Loose indeed, and indigested, must be all the hints\r\nI can note. Might grammar, rhetoric, logic, and ethics, be under one\r\nprofessor? Might mathematics, mechanics, natural philosophy, be under\r\nanother? Geography and astronomy under a third? Laws and government,\r\nhistory and chronology, under a fourth? Classics might require a fifth.\r\n\r\nCondilac's Course of Study has excellent parts. Among many systems of\r\nmathematics, English, French and American, there is none preferable to\r\nBesout's Course. La Harpe's Course of Literature is very valuable.\r\n\r\nBut I am ashamed to add any more to the broken innuendos, except\r\nassurances of my continued friendship.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE BARON DE MOLL, PRIVY COUNSELLOR OF HIS MAJESTY THE KING\r\nOF BAVARIA, SECRETARY OF THE ACADEMY OF SCIENCES FOR THE CLASS OF\r\nMATHEMATICAL AND PHYSICAL SCIENCES, AND OF THE AGRONOMIC SOCIETY OF\r\nBAVARIA, AT MUNICH.\r\n\r\n                                                 MONTICELLO, July 31, 1814.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Within a few days only, I have received the letter which you did\r\nme the honor to write on the 22d of July, 1812; a delay which I presume\r\nmust be ascribed to the interruption of the intercourse of the world by\r\nthe wars which have lately desolated it by sea and land. Still involved\r\nourselves with a nation possessing almost exclusively the ocean which\r\nseparates us, I fear the one I have now the honor of addressing you may\r\nexperience equal delay. I receive with much gratification the diploma\r\nof the Agronomic Society of Bavaria, conferring on me the distinction\r\nof being honorary member of their society. For this mark of their good\r\nwill, I pray you to be the channel of communicating to them my respectful\r\nthanks. Age and distance will add their obstacles to the services I\r\nshall ardently wish to render the society. Yet sincerely devoted to\r\nthis art, the basis of the subsistence, the comforts and the happiness\r\nof man, and sensible of the general interest which all nations have\r\nin communicating freely to each other discoveries of new and useful\r\nprocesses and implements in it, I shall with zeal at all times meet the\r\nwishes of the society, and especially rejoice in every opportunity which\r\ntheir commands may present of being useful to them. With the homage of\r\nmy respects to them, be pleased to accept for yourself the assurances\r\nof my particular and high consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. WIRT.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, August 14, 1814.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have been laying under contribution my memory, my private\r\npapers, the printed records, gazettes and pamphlets in my possession,\r\nto answer the inquiries of your letter of July 27, and I will give you\r\nthe result as correctly as I can. I kept no copy of the paper I sent\r\nyou on a former occasion on the same subject, nor do I retain an exact\r\nrecollection of its contents. But if in that I stated the question on\r\nthe loan office to have been in 1762, I did it with too slight attention\r\nto the date, although not to the fact. I have examined the journals of\r\nthe House of Burgesses, of 1760-1-2, in my possession, and find no trace\r\nof the proceeding in them. By those of 1764, I find that the famous\r\naddress to the king, and memorials to the Houses of Lords and Commons,\r\non the proposal of the Stamp Act, were of that date; and I know that Mr.\r\nHenry was not a member of the legislature when they were passed. I know\r\nalso, because I was present, that Robinson, (who died in May, 1766,) was\r\nin the chair on the question of the loan office. Mr. Henry, then, must\r\nhave come in between these two epochs, and consequently in 1765. Of this\r\nyear I have no journals to refresh my memory. The first session was in\r\nMay, and his first remarkable exhibition there was on the motion for\r\nthe establishment of an office for lending money on mortgages of real\r\nproperty. I find in Royle's Virginia Gazette, of the 17th of that month\r\nthis proposition for the loan office brought forward, its advantages\r\ndetailed, and the plan explained; and it seems to have been done by a\r\nborrowing member, from the feeling with which the motives are expressed;\r\nand to have been preparatory to the intended motion. This was probably\r\nmade immediately after that date, and certainly before the 30th, which\r\nwas the date of Mr. Henry's famous resolutions. I had been intimate\r\nwith Mr. Henry since the winter of 1759-60, and felt an interest in what\r\nconcerned him, and I can never forget a particular exclamation of his in\r\nthe debate in which he electrified his hearers. It had been urged that\r\nfrom certain unhappy circumstances of the colony, men of substantial\r\nproperty had contracted debts, which, if exacted suddenly, must ruin them\r\nand their families, but, with a little indulgence of time, might be paid\r\nwith ease. \"What, Sir!\" exclaimed Mr. Henry, in animadverting on this,\r\n\"is it proposed then to reclaim the spendthrift from his dissipation\r\nand extravagance, by filling his pockets with money.\" These expressions\r\nare indelibly impressed on my memory. He laid open with so much energy\r\nthe spirit of favoritism on which the proposition was founded, and the\r\nabuses to which it would lead, that it was crushed in its birth. Abortive\r\nmotions are not always entered on the journals, or rather, they are\r\nrarely entered. It is the modern introduction of yeas and nays which has\r\ngiven the means of placing a rejected motion on the journals; and it is\r\nlikely that the speaker, who, as treasurer, was to be the loan officer,\r\nand had the direction of the journals, would choose to omit an entry of\r\nthe motion in this case. This accounts sufficiently for the absence of\r\nany trace of the motion in the journals. There was no suspicion then,\r\n(as far, at least, as I know,) that Robinson had used the public money\r\nin private loans to his friends, and that the secret object of this\r\nscheme was to transfer those debtors to the public, and thus clear his\r\naccounts. I have diligently examined the names of the members on the\r\njournals of 1764, to see if any were still living to whose memory we\r\nmight recur on this subject, but I find not a single one now remaining\r\nin life.\r\n\r\nOf the parson's cause I remember nothing remarkable. I was at school\r\nwith Mr. Maury during the years 1758 and 1759, and often heard them\r\ninveigh against the iniquity of the act of 1758, called the two-penny\r\nact. In 1763, when that cause was decided in Hanover, I was a law-student\r\nin Williamsburg, and remember only that it was a subject of much\r\nconversation, and of great paper-controversy, in which Camm, and Colonel\r\nBland, were the principal champions.\r\n\r\nThe disputed election in which Mr. Henry made himself remarkable, must\r\nhave been that of Dandridge and Littlepage, in 1764, of which, however, I\r\nrecollect no particulars, although I was still a student in Williamsburg,\r\nand paid attention to what was passing in the legislature.\r\n\r\nI proceed now to the resolution of 1765. The copies you enclose me, and\r\nthat inserted by Judge Marshall in his history, and copied verbatim by\r\nBurke, are really embarrassing by their differences. 1. That of the four\r\nresolutions taken from the records of the House, is the genuine copy\r\nof what they passed, _as amended_ by themselves, cannot be doubted. 2.\r\nThat the copy which Mr. Henry left sealed up, is a true copy of these\r\nfour resolutions, _as reported_ by the committee, there is no reason to\r\ndoubt. 3. That Judge Marshall's version of three of these resolutions,\r\n(for he has omitted one altogether,) is from an unauthentic source\r\nis sufficiently proved by their great variation from the record in\r\ndiction, although equivalent in sentiment. But what are we to say of\r\nMr. Henry's fifth, and Mr. Marshall's two last, which we may call the\r\nsixth and seventh resolutions? The fifth has clearly nothing to justify\r\nthe debate and proceedings which one of them produced. But the sixth is\r\nof that character, and perfectly tallies with the idea impressed on my\r\nmind, of that which was expunged. Judge Marshall tells us that two were\r\ndisagreed to by the House, which may be true. I do not indeed recollect\r\nit, but I have no recollection to the contrary. My hypothesis, then, is\r\nthis, that the two disagreed to were the fifth and seventh. The fifth,\r\nbecause merely tautologous of the third and fourth, and the seventh,\r\nbecause leading to individual persecution, for which no mind was then\r\nprepared. And that the sixth was the one passed by the House, by a\r\nmajority of a single vote, and expunged from the journals the next day.\r\nI was standing at the door of communication between the house and lobby\r\nduring the debates and vote, and well remember, that after the numbers\r\non the division were told, and declared from the chair, Peyton Randolph\r\n(then Attorney General) came out at the door where I was standing,\r\nand exclaimed, \"By God, I would have given one hundred guineas for a\r\nsingle vote.\" For one vote would have divided the house, and Robinson\r\nwas in the chair, who he knew would have negatived the resolution. Mr.\r\nHenry left town that evening, or the next morning; and Colonel Peter\r\nRandolph, then a member of the Council, came to the House of Burgesses\r\nabout 10 o'clock of the forenoon, and sat at the clerk's table till\r\nthe House-bell rang, thumbing over the volumes of Journals to find a\r\nprecedent of expunging a vote of the House, which he said had taken place\r\nwhile he was a member or clerk of the House, I do not recollect which.\r\nI stood by him at the end of the table a considerable part of the time,\r\nlooking on as he turned over the leaves, but I do not recollect whether\r\nhe found the erasure. In the meantime, some of the timid members, who\r\nhad voted for the strongest resolution, had become alarmed, and as soon\r\nas the House met, a motion was made, and carried, to expunge it from\r\nthe journals. And here I will observe, that Burke's statement with his\r\nopponents, is entirely erroneous. I suppose the original journal was\r\namong those destroyed by the British, or its obliterated face might be\r\nappealed to. It is a pity this investigation was not made a few years\r\nsooner, when some of the members of the day were still living. I think\r\ninquiry should be made of Judge Marshall for the source from which\r\nhe derived his copy of the resolutions. This might throw light on the\r\nsixth and seventh, which I verily believe, and especially the sixth, to\r\nbe genuine in substance. On the whole, I suppose the four resolutions\r\nwhich are on the record, were passed and retained by the House; that\r\nthe sixth is that which was passed by a single vote and expunged, and\r\nthe fifth and seventh, the two which Judge Marshall says were disagreed\r\nto. That Mr. Henry's copy, then, should not have stated all this, is\r\nthe remaining difficulty. This copy he probably sealed up long after\r\nthe transaction, for it was long afterwards that these resolutions,\r\ninstead of the address and memorials of the preceding year, were looked\r\nback to as the commencement of legislative opposition. His own judgment\r\nmay, at a later date, have approved of the rejection of the sixth and\r\nseventh, although not of the fifth, and he may have left and sealed up\r\na copy, in his own handwriting, as approved by his ultimate judgment.\r\nThis, to be sure, is conjecture, and may rightfully be rejected by any\r\none to whom a more plausible solution may occur; and there I must leave\r\nit. The address of 1764 was drawn by Peyton Randolph. Who drew the\r\nmemorial to the Lords I do not recollect, but Mr. Wythe drew that to\r\nthe Commons. It was done with so much freedom, that, as he has told me\r\nhimself, his colleagues of the committee shrank from it as bearing the\r\naspect of treason, and smoothed its features to its present form. He\r\nwas, indeed, one of the very few, (for I can barely speak of them in the\r\nplural number,) of either character, who, from the commencement of the\r\ncontest, hung our connection with Great Britain on its true hook, that\r\nof a common king. His unassuming character, however, made him appear as\r\na follower, while his sound judgment kept him in a line with the freest\r\nspirit. By these resolutions, Mr. Henry took the lead out of the hands\r\nof those who had heretofore guided the proceedings of the House, that\r\nis to say, of Pendleton, Wythe, Bland, Randolph, Nicholas. These were\r\nhonest and able men, had begun the opposition on the same grounds, but\r\nwith a moderation more adapted to their age and experience. Subsequent\r\nevents favored the bolder spirits of Henry, the Lees, Pages, Mason, &c.,\r\nwith whom I went in all points. Sensible, however, of the importance\r\nof unanimity among our constituents, although we often wished to have\r\ngone faster, we slackened our pace, that our less ardent colleagues\r\nmight keep up with us; and they, on their part, differing nothing from\r\nus in principle, quickened their gait somewhat beyond that which their\r\nprudence might of itself have advised, and thus consolidated the phalanx\r\nwhich breasted the power of Britain. By this harmony of the bold with\r\nthe cautious, we advanced with our constituents in undivided mass, and\r\nwith fewer examples of separation than, perhaps, existed in any other\r\npart of the Union.\r\n\r\nI do not remember the topics of Mr. Henry's argument, but those of his\r\nopposers were that the same sentiments had been expressed in the address\r\nand memorials of the preceding session, to which an answer was expected\r\nand not yet received. I well remember the cry of treason, the pause of\r\nMr. Henry at the name of George the III., and the presence of mind with\r\nwhich he closed his sentence, and baffled the charge vociferated. I\r\ndo not think he took the position in the middle of the floor which you\r\nmention. On the contrary, I think I recollect him standing in the very\r\nplace which he continued afterwards habitually to occupy in the house.\r\n\r\nThe censure of Mr. E. Randolph on Mr. Henry in the case of Philips,\r\nwas without foundation. I remember the case, and took my part in it.\r\nPhilips was a mere robber, who availing himself of the troubles of the\r\ntimes, collected a banditti, retired to the Dismal Swamp, and from thence\r\nsallied forth, plundering and maltreating the neighboring inhabitants, and\r\ncovering himself, without authority, under the name of a British subject.\r\nMr. Henry, then Governor, communicated the case to me. We both thought\r\nthe best proceeding would be by bill of attainder, unless he delivered\r\nhimself up for trial within a given time. Philips was afterwards taken;\r\nand Mr. Randolph being Attorney General, and apprehending he would plead\r\nthat he was a British subject, taken in arms, in support of his lawful\r\nsovereign, and as a prisoner of war entitled to the protection of the law\r\nof nations, he thought the safest proceeding would be to indict him at\r\ncommon law as a felon and robber. Against this I believe Philips urged\r\nthe same plea: he was overruled and found guilty.\r\n\r\nI recollect nothing of a doubt on the re-eligibility of Mr. Henry to the\r\ngovernment when his term expired in 1779, nor can I conceive on what\r\nground such a doubt could have been entertained, unless perhaps that\r\nhis first election in June, 1776, having been before we were nationally\r\ndeclared independent, some might suppose it should not be reckoned as\r\none of the three constitutional elections.\r\n\r\nOf the projects for appointing a Dictator there are said to have been two.\r\nI know nothing of either but by hearsay. The first was in Williamsburg\r\nin December, 1776. The Assembly had the month before appointed Mr.\r\nWythe, Mr. Pendleton, George Mason, Thomas L. Lee, and myself, to revise\r\nthe whole body of laws, and adapt them to our new form of government.\r\nI left the House early in December to prepare to join the Committee at\r\nFredericksburg, the place of our first meeting. What passed, therefore,\r\nin the House in December, I know not, and have not the journals of that\r\nsession to look into. The second proposition was in June, 1781, at the\r\nStaunton session of the legislature. No trace of this last motion is\r\nentered on the journals of that date, which I have examined. This is a\r\nfurther proof that the silence of the journals is no evidence against the\r\nfact of an abortive motion. Among the names of the members found on the\r\njournal of the Staunton session, are John Taylor of Caroline, General\r\nAndrew Moore, and General Edward Stevens of Culpeper, now living. It\r\nwould be well to ask information from each of them, that their errors\r\nof memory, or of feeling, may be corrected by collation.\r\n\r\nYou ask if I would have any objection to be quoted as to the fact of\r\nrescinding the last of Mr. Henry's resolutions. None at all as to that\r\nfact, or its having been passed by a majority of one vote only; the scene\r\nbeing as present to my mind as that in which I am now writing. But I do\r\nnot affirm, although I believe it was the sixth resolution.\r\n\r\nIt is truly unfortunate that those engaged in public affairs so rarely\r\nmake notes of transactions passing within their knowledge. Hence history\r\nbecomes fable instead of fact. The great outlines may be true, but the\r\nincidents and coloring are according to the faith or fancy of the writer.\r\nHad Judge Marshall taken half your pains in sifting and scrutinizing\r\nfacts, he would not have given to the world, as true history, a false\r\ncopy of a record under his eye. Burke again has copied him, and being a\r\nsecond writer on the spot, doubles the credit of the copy. When writers\r\nare so indifferent as to the correctness of facts, the verification\r\nof which lies at their elbow, by what measure shall we estimate\r\ntheir relation of things distant, or of those given to us through the\r\nobliquities of their own vision? Our records, it is true, in the case\r\nunder contemplation, were destroyed by the malice and Vandalism of the\r\nBritish military, perhaps of their government, under whose orders they\r\ncommitted so much useless mischief. But printed copies remained, as your\r\nexamination has proved. Those which were apocryphal, then, ought not to\r\nhave been hazarded without examination. Should you be able to ascertain\r\nthe genuineness of the sixth and seventh resolutions, I would ask a line\r\nof information, to rectify or to confirm my own impressions respecting\r\nthem. Ever affectionately yours.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THOMAS COOPER.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, August 25, 1814.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--In my letter of January 16th, I mentioned to you that it\r\nhad long been in contemplation to get an University established in this\r\nState, in which all the branches of science useful _to us_, and _at this\r\nday_, should be taught in their highest degree, and that this institution\r\nshould be incorporated with the College and funds of William and Mary.\r\nBut what are the sciences useful to us, and at this day thought useful to\r\nanybody? A glance over Bacon's _arbor scientiæ_ will show the foundation\r\nfor this question, and how many of his ramifications of science are now\r\nlopt off as nugatory. To be prepared for this new establishment, I have\r\ntaken some pains to ascertain those branches which men of sense, as well\r\nas of science, deem worthy of cultivation. To the statements which I\r\nhave obtained from other sources, I should highly value an addition of\r\none from yourself. You know our country, its pursuits, its faculties,\r\nits relations with others, its means of establishing and maintaining an\r\ninstitution of general science, and the spirit of economy with which\r\nit requires that these should be administered. Will you then so far\r\ncontribute to our views as to consider this subject, to make a statement\r\nof the branches of science which you think worthy of being taught, as I\r\nhave before said, at this day, and in this country? But to accommodate\r\nthem to our economy, it will be necessary further to distribute them\r\ninto groups, each group comprehending as many branches as one industrious\r\nProfessor may competently teach, and, as much as may be, a duly associated\r\nfamily, or class, of kindred sciences. The object of this is to bring\r\nthe whole circle of useful science under the direction of the smallest\r\nnumber of professors possible, and that our means may be so frugally\r\nemployed as to effect the greatest possible good. We are about to make\r\nan effort for the introduction of this institution.\r\n\r\nOn the subject of patent rights, on which something has passed between\r\nus before, you may have noted that the patent board, while it existed,\r\nhad proposed to reduce their decisions to a system of rules as fast\r\nas the cases presented should furnish materials. They had done but\r\nlittle when the business was turned over to the courts of justice, on\r\nwhom the same duty has now devolved. A rule has occurred to me, which\r\nI think would reach many of our cases, and go far towards securing the\r\ncitizen against the vexation of frivolous patents. It is to consider the\r\ninvention of any new mechanical power, or of any new combination of the\r\nmechanical powers already known, as entitled to an exclusive grant; but\r\nthat the purchaser of the right to use the invention should be free to\r\napply it to every purpose of which it is susceptible. For instance, the\r\ncombination of machinery for threshing wheat, should be applicable to\r\nthe threshing of rye, oats, beans, &c. The spinning machine to everything\r\nof which it may be found capable; the chain of buckets, of which we have\r\nbeen possessed thousands of years, we should be free to use for raising\r\nwater, ore, grains, meals, or anything else we can make it raise. These\r\nrights appear sufficiently distinct, and the distinction sound enough,\r\nto be adopted by the judges, to whom it could not be better suggested\r\nthan through the medium of the Emporium, should any future paper of that\r\nfurnish place for the hint.\r\n\r\nSince the change of government in France, I am in hopes the author of\r\nthe Review of Montesquieu will consent to be named, and perhaps may\r\npublish there his original work; not that their press is free, but that\r\nthe present government will be restrained by public opinion, whereas\r\nthe late military despotism respected that of the army only. I salute\r\nyou with friendship and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. DELAPLAINE.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, August 28, 1814.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your letter of the 17th is received. I have not the book of\r\nMunoz containing the print of Columbus. That work came out after I left\r\nEurope, and we have not the same facility of acquiring new continental\r\npublications here as there. I have no doubt that entire credit is to be\r\ngiven to the account of the print rendered by him in the extract from his\r\nwork which you have sent me; and as you say that several have attempted\r\ntranslations of it, each differing from the other, and none satisfactory\r\nto yourself, I will add to your stock my understanding of it, that by a\r\ncollation of the several translations, the author's meaning may be the\r\nbetter elicited.\r\n\r\nTranslation. \"This first volume presents at the beginning the portrait\r\nof the discoverer, designed and engraved with care. Among many paintings\r\nand prints which are falsely sold as his likenesses, I have seen one\r\nonly which can be such, and it is that which is preserved in the house of\r\nthe most excellent Duke of Berwick and Lina, a descendant of our hero; a\r\nfigure of the natural size, painted, as would seem, in the last century,\r\nby an indifferent copyist, in which, nevertheless, appear some catches\r\nfrom the hand of Antonio del Rincon, a celebrated painter of the Catholic\r\nkings. The description given by Fernando Colon, of the countenance of\r\nhis father, has served to render the likeness more resembling, and to\r\ncorrect the faults which are observable in some of the features either\r\nimperfectly seized by the artist, or disfigured by the injuries of time.\"\r\n\r\nParaphrase explanatory of the above. Columbus was employed by Ferdinand\r\nand Isabella, on his voyage of discovery in 1492. Debry tells us that\r\n\"before his departure, his portrait was taken by order of the king and\r\nqueen,\" and most probably by Rincon, their first painter. Rincon died in\r\n1500, and Columbus in 1506. Fernando, his son, an ecclesiastic, wrote\r\nthe life of his father in 1530, and describes in that his father's\r\ncountenance. An indifferent hand in the 17th century, copied Rincon's\r\npainting, which copy is preserved in the house of the Duke of Berwick. In\r\n1793, when a print of Columbus was wanting for the history of Munoz, the\r\nartist from this copy, injured as it was by time, but still exhibiting\r\nsome catches of Rincon's style, and from the verbal description of the\r\ncountenance of Columbus in the history by his son, has been enabled to\r\ncorrect the faults of the copy, whether those of the copyist or proceeding\r\nfrom the injuries of time, and thus to furnish the best likeness.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish text admits this construction, and well-known dates and\r\nhistorical facts verify it.\r\n\r\nI have taken from the second volume of Debry a rough model of the leaf on\r\nwhich is the print he has given of Columbus and his preface. It gives the\r\nexact size and outline of the print which, with a part of the preface,\r\nis on the first page of the leaf, and the rest on the second. I have\r\nextracted from it what related to the print, which you will perceive\r\ncould not be cut out without a great mutilation of the book. This would\r\nnot be regarded as to its cost, which was twelve guineas for the three\r\nvolumes in Amsterdam, but that it seems to be the only copy of the work\r\nin the United States, and I know from experience the difficulty, if\r\nnot impossibility, of getting another. I had orders lodged with several\r\neminent booksellers in the principal book-marts of Europe, to-wit: London,\r\nParis, Amsterdam, Frankfort, Madrid, several years before this copy was\r\nobtained at the accidental sale of an old library in Amsterdam, on the\r\ndeath of its proprietor.\r\n\r\nWe have, then, three likenesses of Columbus, from which a choice is to\r\nbe made.\r\n\r\n1. The print in Munoz' work, from a copy of Rincon's original, taken in\r\nthe 17th century by an indifferent hand, with conjectural alterations\r\nsuggested by the verbal description of the younger Columbus of the\r\ncountenance of his father.\r\n\r\n2. The miniature of Debry, from a copy taken in the sixteenth century\r\nfrom the portrait made by order of the king and queen, probably that of\r\nRincon.\r\n\r\n3. The copy in my possession of the size of life, taken for me from the\r\noriginal, which is in the gallery of Florence. I say from an original,\r\nbecause it is well known that in collections of any note, and that of\r\nFlorence is the first in the world, _no copy_ is ever admitted; and\r\nan original existing in Genoa would readily be obtained for a royal\r\ncollection in Florence. Vasari, in his lives of the painters, names this\r\nportrait in his catalogue of the paintings in that gallery, but does\r\nnot say by whom it was made. It has the aspect of a man of thirty-five,\r\nstill smooth-faced and in the vigor of life, which would place its date\r\nabout 1477, fifteen years earlier than that of Rincon. Accordingly, in\r\nthe miniature of Debry, the face appears more furrowed by time. On the\r\nwhole, I should have no hesitation at giving this the preference over\r\nthe conjectural one of Munoz, and the miniature of Debry.\r\n\r\nThe book from which I cut the print of Vespucius which I sent you, has\r\nthe following title and date: \"Elogio d'Amerigo Vespucci che ha riportato\r\nil premio dalla nobile accademia Etrusca de Cortona nel dè 15 d'Ottobre\r\ndell' Anno 1788, del P. Stanislao Canovai della scuole prie publico\r\nprofessore di fisica. Matematica in Firenze 1788, nella stamp di Pietro\r\nAllegrini.\" This print is unquestionably from the same original in the\r\ngallery of Florence from which my copy was also taken. The portrait is\r\nnamed in the catalogue of Vasari, and mentioned also by Bandini, in his\r\nlife of Americus Vespucius; but neither gives its history. Both tell us\r\nthere was a portrait of Vespucius taken by Domenico, and a fine head of\r\nhim by Da Vinci, which, however, are lost, so that it would seem that\r\nthis of Florence is the only one existing.\r\n\r\nWith this offering of what occurs to me on the subject of these prints,\r\naccept the assurance of my respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THOMAS COOPER, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                            MONTICELLO, September 10, 1814.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I regret much that I was so late in consulting you on the\r\nsubject of the academy we wish to establish here. The progress of that\r\nbusiness has obliged me to prepare an address to the President of the\r\nBoard of Trustees,--a plan for its organization. I send you a copy of\r\nit with a broad margin, that, if your answer to mine of August 25th be\r\nnot on the way, you may be so good as to write your suggestions either\r\nin the margin or on a separate paper. We shall still be able to avail\r\nourselves of them by way of amendments.\r\n\r\nYour letter of August 17th is received. Mr. Ogilvie left us four days\r\nago, on a tour of health, which is to terminate at New York, from whence\r\nhe will take his passage to Britain to receive livery and seisin of his\r\nnew dignities and fortunes. I am in the daily hope of seeing M. Corrica,\r\nand the more anxious as I must in two or three weeks commence a journey\r\nof long absence from home.\r\n\r\nA comparison of the conditions of Great Britain and the United States,\r\nwhich is the subject of your letter of August 17th, would be an\r\ninteresting theme indeed. To discuss it minutely and demonstratively\r\nwould be far beyond the limits of a letter. I will give you, therefore,\r\nin brief only, the result of my reflections on the subject. I agree\r\nwith you in your facts, and in many of your reflections. My conclusion\r\nis without doubt, as I am sure yours will be, when the appeal to\r\nyour sound judgment is seriously made. The population of England is\r\ncomposed of three descriptions of persons, (for those of minor note\r\nare too inconsiderable to affect a general estimate.) These are, 1. The\r\naristocracy, comprehending the nobility, the wealthy commoners, the high\r\ngrades of priesthood, and the officers of government. 2. The laboring\r\nclass. 3. The eleemosynary class, or paupers, who are about one-fifth of\r\nthe whole. The aristocracy, which has the laws and government in their\r\nhands, have so managed them as to reduce the third description below\r\nthe means of supporting life, even by labor; and to force the second,\r\nwhether employed in agriculture or the arts, to the maximum of labor\r\nwhich the construction of the human body can endure, and to the minimum\r\nof food, and of the meanest kind, which will preserve it in life, and in\r\nstrength sufficient to perform its functions. To obtain food enough, and\r\nclothing, not only their whole strength must be unremittingly exerted,\r\nbut the utmost dexterity also which they can acquire; and those of\r\ngreat dexterity only can keep their ground, while those of less must\r\nsink into the class of paupers. Nor is it manual dexterity alone, but\r\nthe acutest resources of the mind also which are impressed into this\r\nstruggle for life; and such as have means a little above the rest, as the\r\nmaster-workmen, for instance, must strengthen themselves by acquiring as\r\nmuch of the philosophy of their trade as will enable them to compete with\r\ntheir rivals, and keep themselves above ground. Hence the industry and\r\nmanual dexterity of their journeymen and day-laborers, and the science\r\nof their master-workmen, keep them in the foremost ranks of competition\r\nwith those of other nations; and the less dexterous individuals,\r\nfalling into the eleemosynary ranks, furnish materials for armies and\r\nnavies to defend their country, exercise piracy on the ocean, and carry\r\nconflagration, plunder and devastation, on the shores of all those who\r\nendeavor to withstand their aggressions. A society thus constituted\r\npossesses certainly the means of defence. But what does it defend? The\r\npauperism of the lowest class, the abject oppression of the laboring, and\r\nthe luxury, the riot, the domination and the vicious happiness of the\r\naristocracy. In their hands, the paupers are used as tools to maintain\r\ntheir own wretchedness, and to keep down the laboring portion by shooting\r\nthem whenever the desperation produced by the cravings of their stomachs\r\ndrives them into riots. Such is the happiness of scientific England;\r\nnow let us see the American side of the medal.\r\n\r\nAnd, first, we have no paupers, the old and crippled among us, who possess\r\nnothing and have no families to take care of them, being too few to merit\r\nnotice as a separate section of society, or to affect a general estimate.\r\nThe great mass of our population is of laborers; our rich, who can live\r\nwithout labor, either manual or professional, being few, and of moderate\r\nwealth. Most of the laboring class possess property, cultivate their own\r\nlands, have families, and from the demand for their labor are enabled\r\nto exact from the rich and the competent such prices as enable them to\r\nbe fed abundantly, clothed above mere decency, to labor moderately and\r\nraise their families. They are not driven to the ultimate resources of\r\ndexterity and skill, because their wares will sell although not quite\r\nso nice as those of England. The wealthy, on the other hand, and those\r\nat their ease, know nothing of what the Europeans call luxury. They have\r\nonly somewhat more of the comforts and decencies of life than those who\r\nfurnish them. Can any condition of society be more desirable than this?\r\nNor in the class of laborers do I mean to withhold from the comparison\r\nthat portion whose color has condemned them, in certain parts of our\r\nUnion, to a subjection to the will of others. Even these are better fed\r\nin these States, warmer clothed, and labor less than the journeymen or\r\nday-laborers of England. They have the comfort, too, of numerous families,\r\nin the midst of whom they live without want, or fear of it; a solace which\r\nfew of the laborers of England possess. They are subject, it is true,\r\nto bodily coercion; but are not the hundreds of thousands of British\r\nsoldiers and seamen subject to the same, without seeing, at the end of\r\ntheir career, when age and accident shall have rendered them unequal\r\nto labor, the certainty, which the other has, that he will never want?\r\nAnd has not the British seaman, as much as the African, been reduced to\r\nthis bondage by force, in flagrant violation of his own consent, and of\r\nhis natural right in his own person? and with the laborers of England\r\ngenerally, does not the moral coercion of want subject their will as\r\ndespotically to that of their employer, as the physical constraint does\r\nthe soldier, the seaman, or the slave? But do not mistake me. I am not\r\nadvocating slavery. I am not justifying the wrongs we have committed\r\non a foreign people, by the example of another nation committing equal\r\nwrongs on their own subjects. On the contrary, there is nothing I would\r\nnot sacrifice to a practicable plan of abolishing every vestige of this\r\nmoral and political depravity. But I am at present comparing the condition\r\nand degree of suffering to which oppression has reduced the man of one\r\ncolor, with the condition and degree of suffering to which oppression\r\nhas reduced the man of another color; equally condemning both. Now let\r\nus compute by numbers the sum of happiness of the two countries. In\r\nEngland, happiness is the lot of the aristocracy only; and the proportion\r\nthey bear to the laborers and paupers, you know better than I do. Were\r\nI to guess that they are four in every hundred, then the happiness of\r\nthe nation would be to its misery as one in twenty-five. In the United\r\nStates it is as eight millions to zero, or as all to none. But it is\r\nsaid they possess the means of defence, and that we do not. How so? Are\r\nwe not men? Yes; but our men are so happy at home that they will not\r\nhire themselves to be shot at for a shilling a day. Hence we can have\r\nno standing armies for defence, because we have no paupers to furnish\r\nthe materials. The Greeks and Romans had no standing armies, yet they\r\ndefended themselves. The Greeks by their laws, and the Romans by the\r\nspirit of their people, took care to put into the hands of their rulers\r\nno such engine of oppression as a standing army. Their system was to\r\nmake every man a soldier, and oblige him to repair to the standard of\r\nhis country whenever that was reared. This made them invincible; and\r\nthe same remedy will make us so. In the beginning of our government we\r\nwere willing to introduce the least coercion possible on the will of the\r\ncitizen. Hence a system of military duty was established too indulgent to\r\nhis indolence. This is the first opportunity we have had of trying it,\r\nand it has completely failed; an issue foreseen by many, and for which\r\nremedies have been proposed. That of classing the militia according to\r\nage, and allotting each age to the particular kind of service to which\r\nit was competent, was proposed to Congress in 1805, and subsequently;\r\nand, on the last trial, was lost, I believe, by a single vote only. Had\r\nit prevailed, what has now happened would not have happened. Instead\r\nof burning our Capitol, we should have possessed theirs in Montreal and\r\nQuebec. We must now adopt it, and all will be safe. We had in the United\r\nStates in 1805, in round numbers of free, able-bodied men,\r\n\r\n             120,000 of the ages of 18 to 21 inclusive.\r\n             200,000    \"     \"     22  \" 26      \"\r\n             200,000    \"     \"     27  \" 35      \"\r\n             200,000    \"     \"     35  \" 45      \"\r\n             -------\r\n     In all, 720,000    \"     \"     18  \" 45      \"\r\n\r\nWith this force properly classed, organized, trained, armed and subject\r\nto tours of a year of military duty, we have no more to fear for the\r\ndefence of our country than those who have the resources of despotism\r\nand pauperism.\r\n\r\nBut, you will say, we have been devastated in the meantime. True, some\r\nof our public buildings have been burnt, and some scores of individuals\r\non the tide-water have lost their movable property and their houses.\r\nI pity them, and execrate the barbarians who delight in unavailing\r\nmischief. But these individuals have their lands and their hands left.\r\nThey are not paupers, they have still better means of subsistence\r\nthan 24/25 of the people of England. Again, the English have burnt our\r\nCapitol and President's house by means of their force. We can burn their\r\nSt. James' and St. Paul's by means of our money, offered to their own\r\nincendiaries, of whom there are thousands in London who would do it\r\nrather than starve. But it is against the laws of civilized warfare to\r\nemploy secret incendiaries. Is it not equally so to destroy the works\r\nof art by armed incendiaries? Bonaparte, possessed at times of almost\r\nevery capital of Europe, with all his despotism and power, injured no\r\nmonument of art. If a nation, breaking through all the restraints of\r\ncivilized character, uses its means of destruction (power, for example)\r\nwithout distinction of objects, may we not use our means (_our_ money and\r\n_their_ pauperism) to retaliate their barbarous ravages? Are we obliged\r\nto use for resistance exactly the weapons chosen by them for aggression?\r\nWhen they destroyed Copenhagen by superior force, against all the laws\r\nof God and man, would it have been unjustifiable for the Danes to have\r\ndestroyed their ships by torpedoes? Clearly not; and they and we should\r\nnow be justifiable in the conflagration of St. James' and St. Paul's.\r\nAnd if we do not carry it into execution, it is because we think it more\r\nmoral and more honorable to set a good example, than follow a bad one.\r\n\r\nSo much for the happiness of the people of England, and the morality of\r\ntheir government, in comparison with the happiness and the morality of\r\nAmerica. Let us pass to another subject.\r\n\r\nThe crisis, then, of the abuses of banking is arrived. The banks have\r\npronounced their own sentence of death. Between two and three hundred\r\nmillions of dollars of their promissory notes are in the hands of the\r\npeople, for solid produce and property sold, and they formally declare\r\nthey will not pay them. This is an act of bankruptcy of course, and\r\nwill be so pronounced by any court before which it shall be brought.\r\nBut _cui bono_? The law can only uncover their insolvency, by opening to\r\nits suitors their empty vaults. Thus by the dupery of our citizens, and\r\ntame acquiescence of our legislators, the nation is plundered of two or\r\nthree hundred millions of dollars, treble the amount of debt contracted\r\nin the revolutionary war, and which, instead of redeeming our liberty,\r\nhas been expended on sumptuous houses, carriages, and dinners. A fearful\r\ntax! if equalized on all; but overwhelming and convulsive by its partial\r\nfall. The crush will be tremendous; very different from that brought on\r\nby our paper money. That rose and fell so gradually that it kept all on\r\ntheir guard, and affected severely only early or long-winded contracts.\r\nHere the contract of yesterday crushes in an instant the one or the\r\nother party. The banks stopping payment suddenly, all their mercantile\r\nand city debtors do the same; and all, in short, except those in the\r\ncountry, who, possessing property, will be good in the end. But this\r\nresource will not enable them to pay a cent on the dollar. From the\r\nestablishment of the United States Bank, to this day, I have preached\r\nagainst this system, but have been sensible no cure could be hoped but in\r\nthe catastrophe now happening. The remedy was to let banks drop gradation\r\nat the expiration of their charters, and for the State governments to\r\nrelinquish the power of establishing others. This would not, as it should\r\nnot, have given the power of establishing them to Congress. But Congress\r\ncould then have issued treasury notes payable within a fixed period,\r\nand founded on a specific tax, the proceeds of which, as they came in,\r\nshould be exchangeable for the notes of that particular emission only.\r\nThis depended, it is true, on the will of the State legislatures, and\r\nwould have brought on us the phalanx of paper interest. But that interest\r\nis now defunct. Their gossamer castles are dissolved, and they can no\r\nlonger impede and overawe the salutary measures of the government. Their\r\npaper was received on a belief that it was cash on demand. Themselves\r\nhave declared it was nothing, and such scenes are now to take place as\r\nwill open the eyes of credulity and of insanity itself, to the dangers of\r\na paper medium abandoned to the discretion of avarice and of swindlers.\r\nIt is impossible not to deplore our past follies, and their present\r\nconsequences, but let them at least be warnings against like follies in\r\nfuture. The banks have discontinued themselves. We are now without any\r\nmedium; and necessity, as well as patriotism and confidence, will make\r\nus all eager to receive treasury notes, if founded on specific taxes.\r\nCongress may now borrow of the public, and without interest, all the\r\nmoney they may want, to the amount of a competent circulation, by merely\r\nissuing their own promissory notes, of proper denominations for the\r\nlarger purposes of circulation, but not for the small. Leave that door\r\nopen for the entrance of metallic money. And, to give readier credit\r\nto their bills, without obliging themselves to give cash for them on\r\ndemand, let their collectors be instructed to do so, when they have cash;\r\nthus, in some measure, performing the functions of a bank, as to their\r\nown notes. Providence seems, indeed, by a special dispensation, to have\r\nput down for us, without a struggle, that very paper enemy which the\r\ninterest of our citizens long since required ourselves to put down, at\r\nwhatever risk. The work is done. The moment is pregnant with futurity,\r\nand if not seized at once by Congress, I know not on what shoal our bark\r\nis next to be stranded. The State legislatures should be immediately\r\nurged to relinquish the right of establishing banks of discount. Most\r\nof them will comply, on patriotic principles, under the convictions of\r\nthe moment; and the non-complying may be crowded into concurrence by\r\nlegitimate devices. _Vale, et me, ut amaris, ama._\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SAMUEL H. SMITH, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                            MONTICELLO, September 21, 1814.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I learn from the newspapers that the Vandalism of our enemy\r\nhas triumphed at Washington over science as well as the arts, by the\r\ndestruction of the public library with the noble edifice in which it was\r\ndeposited. Of this transaction, as of that of Copenhagen, the world will\r\nentertain but one sentiment. They will see a nation suddenly withdrawn\r\nfrom a great war, full armed and full handed, taking advantage of\r\nanother whom they had recently forced into it, unarmed, and unprepared,\r\nto indulge themselves in acts of barbarism which do not belong to a\r\ncivilized age. When Van Ghent destroyed their shipping at Chatham, and\r\nDe Ruyter rode triumphantly up the Thames, he might in like manner, by\r\nthe acknowledgment of their own historians, have forced all their ships\r\nup to London bridge, and there have burnt them, the tower, and city,\r\nhad these examples been then set. London, when thus menaced, was near\r\na thousand years old, Washington is but in its teens.\r\n\r\nI presume it will be among the early objects of Congress to re-commence\r\ntheir collection. This will be difficult while the war continues, and\r\nintercourse with Europe is attended with so much risk. You know my\r\ncollection, its condition and extent. I have been fifty years making\r\nit, and have spared no pains, opportunity or expense, to make it what it\r\nis. While residing in Paris, I devoted every afternoon I was disengaged,\r\nfor a summer or two, in examining all the principal bookstores, turning\r\nover every book with my own hand, and putting by everything which\r\nrelated to America, and indeed whatever was rare and valuable in every\r\nscience. Besides this, I had standing orders during the whole time I\r\nwas in Europe, on its principal book-marts, particularly Amsterdam,\r\nFrankfort, Madrid and London, for such works relating to America as could\r\nnot be found in Paris. So that in that department particularly, such a\r\ncollection was made as probably can never again be effected, because it\r\nis hardly probable that the same opportunities, the same time, industry,\r\nperseverance and expense, with some knowledge of the bibliography of\r\nthe subject, would again happen to be in concurrence. During the same\r\nperiod, and after my return to America, I was led to procure, also,\r\nwhatever related to the duties of those in the high concerns of the\r\nnation. So that the collection, which I suppose is of between nine and\r\nten thousand volumes, while it includes what is chiefly valuable in\r\nscience and literature generally, extends more particularly to whatever\r\nbelongs to the American statesman. In the diplomatic and parliamentary\r\nbranches, it is particularly full. It is long since I have been sensible\r\nit ought not to continue private property, and had provided that at my\r\ndeath, Congress should have the refusal of it at their own price. But\r\nthe loss they have now incurred, makes the present the proper moment\r\nfor their accommodation, without regard to the small remnant of time and\r\nthe barren use of my enjoying it. I ask of your friendship, therefore,\r\nto make for me the tender of it to the library committee of Congress,\r\nnot knowing myself of whom the committee consists. I enclose you the\r\ncatalogue, which will enable them to judge of its contents. Nearly the\r\nwhole are well bound, abundance of them elegantly, and of the choicest\r\neditions existing. They may be valued by persons named by themselves,\r\nand the payment made convenient to the public. It may be, for instance,\r\nin such annual instalments as the law of Congress has left at their\r\ndisposal, or in stock of any of their late loans, or of any loan they\r\nmay institute at this session, so as to spare the present calls of our\r\ncountry, and await its days of peace and prosperity. They may enter,\r\nnevertheless, into immediate use of it, as eighteen or twenty wagons\r\nwould place it in Washington in a single trip of a fortnight. I should be\r\nwilling indeed, to retain a few of the books, to amuse the time I have\r\nyet to pass, which might be valued with the rest, but not included in\r\nthe sum of valuation until they should be restored at my death, which I\r\nwould carefully provide for, so that the whole library as it stands in the\r\ncatalogue at this moment should be theirs without any garbling. Those I\r\nshould like to retain would be chiefly classical and mathematical. Some\r\nfew in other branches, and particularly one of the five encyclopedias\r\nin the catalogue. But this, if not acceptable, would not be urged. I\r\nmust add, that I have not revised the library since I came home to live,\r\nso that it is probable some of the books may be missing, except in the\r\nchapters of Law and Divinity, which have been revised and stand exactly as\r\nin the catalogue. The return of the catalogue will of course be needed,\r\nwhether the tender be accepted or not. I do not know that it contains\r\nany branch of science which Congress would wish to exclude from their\r\ncollection; there is, in fact, no subject to which a member of Congress\r\nmay not have occasion to refer. But such a wish would not correspond\r\nwith my views of preventing its dismemberment. My desire is either to\r\nplace it in their hands entire, or to preserve it so here. I am engaged\r\nin making an alphabetical index of the author's names, to be annexed\r\nto the catalogue, which I will forward to you as soon as completed. Any\r\nagreement you shall be so good as to take the trouble of entering into\r\nwith the committee, I hereby confirm. Accept the assurance of my great\r\nesteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n                                            MONTICELLO, September 24, 1814.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--It is very long since I troubled you with a letter, which\r\nhas proceeded from discretion and not want of inclination, because I\r\nhave really had nothing to write which ought to have occupied your time.\r\nBut in the late events at Washington I have felt so much for you that\r\nI cannot withhold the expression of my sympathies. For although every\r\nreasonable man must be sensible that all you can do is to order that\r\nexecution must depend on others, and failures be imputed to them alone,\r\nyet I know that when such failures happen, they afflict even those who\r\nhave done everything they could to prevent them. Had General Washington\r\nhimself been now at the head of our affairs, the same event would\r\nprobably have happened. We all remember the disgraces which befell us\r\nin his time in a trifling war with one or two petty tribes of Indians,\r\nin which two armies were cut off by not half their numbers. Every one\r\nknew, and I personally knew, because I was then of his council, that no\r\nblame was imputable to him, and that his officers alone were the cause\r\nof the disasters. They must now do the same justice. I am happy to turn\r\nto a countervailing event, and to congratulate you on the destruction\r\nof a second hostile fleet on the lakes by McDonough; of which, however,\r\nwe have not the details. While our enemies cannot but feel shame for\r\ntheir barbarous achievements at Washington, they will be stung to the\r\nsoul by these repeated victories over them on that element on which they\r\nwish the world to think them invincible. We have dissipated that error.\r\nThey must now feel a conviction themselves that we can beat them gun\r\nto gun, ship to ship and fleet to fleet, and that their early successes\r\non the land have been either purchased from traitors, or obtained from\r\nraw men entrusted of necessity with commands for which no experience\r\nhad qualified them, and that every day is adding that experience to\r\nunquestioned bravery.\r\n\r\nI am afraid the failure of our banks will occasion embarrassment for\r\nawhile, although it restores to us a fund which ought never to have been\r\nsurrendered by the nation, and which now, prudently used, will carry us\r\nthrough all the fiscal difficulties of the war. At the request of Mr.\r\nEppes, who was chairman of the committee of finance at the preceding\r\nsession, I had written him some long letters on this subject. Colonel\r\nMonroe asked the reading of them some time ago, and I now send him\r\nanother, written to a member of our legislature, who requested my ideas on\r\nthe recent bank events. They are too long for your reading, but Colonel\r\nMonroe can, in a few sentences, state to you their outline.\r\n\r\nLearning by the papers the loss of the library of Congress, I have\r\nsent my catalogue to S. H. Smith, to make to their library committee\r\nthe offer of my collection, now of about nine or ten thousand volumes,\r\nwhich may be delivered to them instantly, on a valuation by persons\r\nof their own naming, and be paid for in any way, and at any term they\r\nplease; in stock, for example, of any loan they have unissued, or of any\r\none they may institute at this session; or in such annual instalments\r\nas are at the disposal of the committee. I believe you are acquainted\r\nwith the condition of the books, should they wish to be ascertained of\r\nthis. I have long been sensible that my library would be an interesting\r\npossession for the public, and the loss Congress has recently sustained,\r\nand the difficulty of replacing it, while our intercourse with Europe is\r\nso obstructed, renders this the proper moment for placing it at their\r\nservice. Accept assurances of my constant and affectionate friendship\r\nand respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. MILES KING.\r\n\r\n                                            MONTICELLO, September 26, 1814.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I duly received your letter of August 20th, and I thank you for\r\nit, because I believe it was written with kind intentions, and a personal\r\nconcern for my future happiness. Whether the particular revelation which\r\nyou suppose to have been made to yourself were real or imaginary, your\r\nreason alone is the competent judge. For dispute as long as we will on\r\nreligious tenets, our reason at last must ultimately decide, as it is\r\nthe only oracle which God has given us to determine between what really\r\ncomes from him and the phantasms of a disordered or deluded imagination.\r\nWhen he means to make a personal revelation, he carries conviction of\r\nits authenticity to the reason he has bestowed as the umpire of truth.\r\nYou believe you have been favored with such a special communication.\r\nYour reason, not mine, is to judge of this; and if it shall be his\r\npleasure to favor me with a like admonition, I shall obey it with the\r\nsame fidelity with which I would obey his known will in all cases.\r\nHitherto I have been under the guidance of that portion of reason which\r\nhe has thought proper to deal out to me. I have followed it faithfully\r\nin all important cases, to such a degree at least as leaves me without\r\nuneasiness; and if on minor occasions I have erred from its dictates,\r\nI have trust in him who made us what we are, and know it was not his\r\nplan to make us always unerring. He has formed us moral agents. Not\r\nthat, in the perfection of his state, he can feel pain or pleasure in\r\nanything we may do; he is far above our power; but that we may promote\r\nthe happiness of those with whom he has placed us in society, by acting\r\nhonestly towards all, benevolently to those who fall within our way,\r\nrespecting sacredly their rights, bodily and mental, and cherishing\r\nespecially their freedom of conscience, as we value our own. I must ever\r\nbelieve that religion substantially good which produces an honest life,\r\nand we have been authorized by one whom you and I equally respect, to\r\njudge of the tree by its fruit. Our particular principles of religion\r\nare a subject of accountability to our God alone. I inquire after no\r\nman's, and trouble none with mine; nor is it given to us in this life\r\nto know whether yours or mine, our friends or our foes, are exactly\r\nthe right. Nay, we have heard it said that there is not a Quaker or a\r\nBaptist, a Presbyterian or an Episcopalian, a Catholic or a Protestant\r\nin heaven; that, on entering that gate, we leave those badges of schism\r\nbehind, and find ourselves united in those principles only in which God\r\nhas united us all. Let us not be uneasy then about the different roads\r\nwe may pursue, as believing them the shortest, to that our last abode;\r\nbut, following the guidance of a good conscience, let us be happy in\r\nthe hope that by these different paths we shall all meet in the end.\r\nAnd that you and I may there meet and embrace, is my earnest prayer.\r\nAnd with this assurance I salute you with brotherly esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOSEPH C. CABELL, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                            MONTICELLO, September 30, 1814.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--In my letter of the 23d, an important fact escaped me which,\r\nlest it should not occur to you, I will mention. The monies arising from\r\nthe sales of the glebe lands in the several counties, have generally,\r\nI believe, and under the sanction of the legislature, been deposited\r\nin some of the banks. So also the funds of the literary society. These\r\ndebts, although parcelled among the counties, yet the counties constitute\r\nthe State, and their representatives the legislature, united into one\r\nwhole. It is right then that owing $300,000 to the banks, they should\r\nstay so much of that sum in their own hands as will secure what the banks\r\nowe to their constituents as divided into counties. Perhaps the loss of\r\nthese funds would be the most lasting of the evils proceeding from the\r\ninsolvency of the banks. Ever yours with great esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THOMAS COOPER, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, October 7, 1814.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your several favors of September 15th, 21st, 22d, came all\r\ntogether by our last mail. I have given to that of the 15th a single\r\nreading only, because the hand writing (not your own) is microscopic\r\nand difficult, and because I shall have an opportunity of studying it\r\nin the Portfolio in print. According to your request I return it for\r\nthat publication, where it will do a great deal of good. It will give\r\nour young men some idea of what constitutes a well-educated man; that\r\nCæsar and Virgil, and a few books of Euclid, do not really contain the\r\nsum of all human knowledge, nor give to a man figure in the ranks of\r\nscience. Your letter will be a valuable source of consultation for us\r\nin our Collegiate courses, when, and if ever, we advance to that stage\r\nof our establishment.\r\n\r\nI agree with yours of the 22d, that a professorship of Theology should\r\nhave no place in our institution. But we cannot always do what is\r\nabsolutely best. Those with whom we act, entertaining different views,\r\nhave the power and the right of carrying them into practice. Truth\r\nadvances, and error recedes step by step only; and to do to our fellow-men\r\nthe most good in our power, we must lead where we can, follow where we\r\ncan not, and still go with them, watching always the favorable moment\r\nfor helping them to another step. Perhaps I should concur with you also\r\nin excluding the _theory_ (not the _practice_) of medicine. This is the\r\ncharlatanerie of the body, as the other is of the mind. For classical\r\nlearning I have ever been a zealous advocate; and in this, as in his\r\ntheory of bleeding and mercury, I was ever opposed to my friend Rush,\r\nwhom I greatly loved; but who has done much harm, in the sincerest\r\npersuasion that he was preserving life and happiness to all around him.\r\nI have not, however, carried so far as you do my ideas of the importance\r\nof a hypercritical knowledge of the Latin and Greek languages. I have\r\nbelieved it sufficient to possess a substantial understanding of their\r\nauthors.\r\n\r\nIn the exclusion of Anatomy and Botany from the eleventh grade of\r\neducation, which is that of the man of independent fortune, we separate\r\nin opinion. In my view, no knowledge can be more satisfactory to a man\r\nthan that of his own frame, its parts, their functions and actions.\r\nAnd Botany I rank with the most valuable sciences, whether we consider\r\nits subjects as furnishing the principal subsistence of life to man\r\nand beast, delicious varieties for our tables, refreshments from our\r\norchards, the adornments of our flower-borders, shade and perfume of our\r\ngroves, materials for our buildings, or medicaments for our bodies. To\r\nthe gentlemen it is certainly more interesting than mineralogy (which I\r\nby no means, however, undervalue), and is more at hand for his amusement;\r\nand to a country family it constitutes a great portion of their social\r\nentertainment. No country gentleman should be without what amuses every\r\nstep he takes into his fields.\r\n\r\nI am sorry to learn the fate of your Emporium. It was adding fast to\r\nour useful knowledge. Our artists particularly, and our statesmen,\r\nwill have cause to regret it. But my hope is that its suspension will\r\nbe temporary only; and that as soon as we get over the crisis of our\r\ndisordered circulation, your publishers will resume it among their first\r\nenterprises. Accept my thanks for the benefit of your ideas to our scheme\r\nof education, and the assurance of my constant esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo ----[12].\r\n\r\n                                              MONTICELLO, October 15, 1814.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I thank you for the information of your letter of the 10th.\r\nIt gives, at length, a fixed character to our prospects. The war,\r\nundertaken, on both sides, to settle the questions of impressment,\r\nand the orders of council, now that these are done away by events, is\r\ndeclared by Great Britain to have changed its object, and to have become\r\na war of conquest, to be waged until she conquers from us our fisheries,\r\nthe province of Maine, the lakes, States and territories north of the\r\nOhio, and the navigation of the Mississippi; in other words, till she\r\nreduces us to unconditional submission. On our part, then, we ought to\r\npropose, as a counterchange of object, the establishment of the meridian\r\nof the mouth of the Sorel northwardly, as the western boundary of all\r\nher possessions. Two measures will enable us to effect it, and without\r\nthese, we cannot even defend ourselves. 1. To organize the militia into\r\nclasses, assigning to each class the duties for which it is fitted,\r\n(which, had it been done when proposed, years ago, would have prevented\r\nall our misfortunes,) abolishing by a declaratory law the doubts which\r\nabstract scruples in some, and cowardice and treachery in others,\r\nhave conjured up about passing imaginary lines, and limiting, at the\r\nsame time, their services to the _contiguous_ provinces of the enemy.\r\nThe 2d is the ways and means. You have seen my ideas on this subject,\r\nand I shall add nothing but a rectification of what either I have ill\r\nexpressed, or you have misapprehended. If I have used any expression\r\nrestraining the emissions of treasury notes to a _sufficient_ medium,\r\nas your letter seems to imply, I have done it inadvertently, and under\r\nthe impression then possessing me, that the war would be very short. A\r\n_sufficient_ medium would not, on the principles of any writer, exceed\r\nthirty millions of dollars, and on those of some not ten millions. Our\r\nexperience has proved it may be run up to two or three hundred millions,\r\nwithout more than doubling what would be the prices of things under\r\na _sufficient_ medium, or say a metallic one, which would always keep\r\nitself at the _sufficient_ point; and, if they rise to this term, and the\r\ndescent from it be gradual, it would not produce sensible revolutions in\r\nprivate fortunes. I shall be able to explain my views more definitely by\r\nthe use of numbers. Suppose we require, to carry on the war, an annual\r\nloan of twenty millions, then I propose that, in the first year, you\r\nshall lay a tax of two millions, and emit twenty millions of treasury\r\nnotes, of a size proper for circulation, and bearing no interest, to\r\nthe redemption of which the proceeds of that tax shall be inviolably\r\npledged and applied, by recalling annually their amount of the identical\r\nbills funded on them. The second year lay another tax of two millions,\r\nand emit twenty millions more. The third year the same, and so on,\r\nuntil you have reached the maximum of taxes which ought to be imposed.\r\nLet me suppose this maximum to be one dollar a head, or ten millions\r\nof dollars, merely as an exemplification more familiar than would be\r\nthe algebraical symbols _x_ or _y_. You would reach this in five years.\r\nThe sixth year, then, still emit twenty millions of treasury notes,\r\nand continue all the taxes two years longer. The seventh year twenty\r\nmillions more, and continue the whole taxes another two years; and so\r\non. Observe, that although you emit ten millions of dollars a year, you\r\ncall in ten millions, and, consequently, add but ten millions annually\r\nto the circulation. It would be in thirty years, then, _primâ facie_,\r\nthat you would reach the present circulation of three hundred millions,\r\nor the ultimate term to which we might adventure. But observe, also,\r\nthat in that time we shall have become thirty millions of people to\r\nwhom three hundred millions of dollars would be no more than one hundred\r\nmillions to us now; which sum would probably not have raised prices more\r\nthan fifty per cent. on what may be deemed the standard, or metallic\r\nprices. This increased population and consumption, while it would be\r\nincreasing the proceeds of the redemption tax, and lessening the balance\r\nannually thrown into circulation, would also absorb, without saturation,\r\nmore of the surplus medium, and enable us to push the same process to a\r\nmuch higher term, to one which we might safely call indefinite, because\r\nextending so far beyond the limits, either in time or expense, of any\r\nsupportable war. All we should have to do would be, when the war should\r\nbe ended, to leave the gradual extinction of these notes to the operation\r\nof the taxes pledged for their redemption; not to suffer a dollar of\r\npaper to be emitted either by public or private authority, but let the\r\nmetallic medium flow back into the channels of circulation, and occupy\r\nthem until another war should oblige us to recur, for its support, to\r\nthe same resource, and the same process, on the circulating medium.\r\n\r\nThe citizens of a country like ours will never have unemployed capital.\r\nToo many enterprises are open, offering high profits, to permit them\r\nto lend their capitals on a regular and moderate interest. They are too\r\nenterprizing and sanguine themselves not to believe they can do better\r\nwith it. I never did believe you could have gone beyond a first or a\r\nsecond loan, not from a want of confidence in the public faith, which is\r\nperfectly sound, but from a want of disposable funds in individuals. The\r\ncirculating fund is the only one we can ever command with certainty. It\r\nis sufficient for all our wants; and the impossibility of even defending\r\nthe country without its aid as a borrowing fund, renders it indispensable\r\nthat the nation should take and keep it in their own hands, as their\r\nexclusive resource.\r\n\r\nI have trespassed on your time so far, for explanation only. I will\r\ndo it no further than by adding the assurances of my affectionate and\r\nrespectful attachment.\r\n\r\n     Years. Emissions. Taxes & Redemptions.

Probably to the President.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n                                              MONTICELLO, October 16, 1814.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your letter of the 10th has been duly received. The objects\r\nof our contest being thus entirely changed by England, we must prepare\r\nfor interminable war. To this end we should put our house in order, by\r\nproviding men and money to indefinite extent. The former may be done\r\nby classing our militia, and assigning each class to the description of\r\nduties for which it is fit. It is nonsense to talk of regulars. They are\r\nnot to be had among a people so easy and happy at home as ours. We might\r\nas well rely on calling down an army of angels from heaven. I trust it\r\nis now seen that the refusal to class the militia, when proposed years\r\nago, is the real source of all our misfortunes in this war. The other\r\ngreat and indispensable object is to enter on such a system of finance,\r\nas can be permanently pursued to any length of time whatever. Let us\r\nbe allured by no projects of banks, public or private, or ephemeral\r\nexpedients, which, enabling us to gasp and flounder a little longer,\r\nonly increase, by protracting the agonies of death.\r\n\r\nPerceiving, in a letter from the President, that either I had ill\r\nexpressed my ideas on a particular part of this subject, in the letters\r\nI sent you, or he had misapprehended them, I wrote him yesterday an\r\nexplanation; and as you have thought the other letters worth a perusal,\r\nand a communication to the Secretary of the Treasury, I enclose you a\r\ncopy of this, lest I should be misunderstood by others also. Only be so\r\ngood as to return me the whole when done with, as I have no other copies.\r\n\r\nSince writing the letter now enclosed, I have seen the Report of the\r\ncommittee of finance, proposing taxes to the amount of twenty millions.\r\nThis is a dashing proposition. But, if Congress pass it, I shall consider\r\nit sufficient evidence that their constituents generally can pay the tax.\r\nNo man has greater confidence than I have, in the spirit of the people,\r\nto a rational extent. Whatever they can, they will. But, without either\r\nmarket or medium, I know not how it is to be done. All markets abroad,\r\nand all at home, are shut to us; so that we have been feeding our horses\r\non wheat. Before the day of collection, bank-notes will be but as oak\r\nleaves; and of specie, there is not within all the United States, one-half\r\nof the proposed amount of the taxes. I had thought myself as bold as was\r\nsafe in contemplating, as possible, an annual taxation of ten millions,\r\nas a fund for emissions of treasury notes; and, when further emissions\r\nshould be necessary, that it would be better to enlarge the time, than\r\nthe tax for redemption. Our position, with respect to our enemy, and our\r\nmarkets, distinguishes us from all other nations; inasmuch, as a state\r\nof war, with us, annihilates in an instant all our surplus produce, that\r\non which we depended for many comforts of life. This renders peculiarly\r\nexpedient the throwing a part of the burdens of war on times of peace\r\nand commerce. Still, however, my hope is that others see resources,\r\nwhich, in my abstraction from the world, are unseen by me; that there\r\nwill be both market and medium to meet these taxes, and that there are\r\ncircumstances which render it wiser to levy twenty millions at once on\r\nthe people, than to obtain the same sum on a tenth of the tax.\r\n\r\nI enclose you a letter from Colonel James Lewis, now of Tennessee, who\r\nwishes to be appointed Indian agent, and I do it lest he should have\r\nrelied solely on this channel of communication. You know him better than I\r\ndo, as he was long your agent. I have always believed him an honest man,\r\nand very good-humored and accommodating. Of his other qualifications for\r\nthe office, you are the best judge. Believe me to be ever affectionately\r\nyours.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DOCTOR ROBERT PATTERSON.\r\n\r\n                                             MONTICELLO, November 23, 1814.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have heretofore confided to you my wishes to retire from the\r\nchair of the Philosophical Society, which, however, under the influence\r\nof your recommendations, I have hitherto deferred. I have never, however,\r\nceased from the purpose, and from everything I can observe or learn at\r\nthis distance, I suppose that a new choice can now be made with as much\r\nharmony as may be expected at any future time. I send therefore, by this\r\nmail, my resignation, with such entreaties to be omitted at the ensuing\r\nelection as I must hope will be yielded to, for in truth I cannot be\r\neasy in holding, as a sinecure, an honor so justly due to the talents\r\nand services of others. I pray your friendly assistance in assuring the\r\nsociety of the sentiments of affectionate respect and gratitude with\r\nwhich I retire from the high and honorable relation in which I have stood\r\nwith them, and that you will believe me to be ever and affectionately\r\nyours.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ROBERT M. PATTERSON, SECRETARY OF THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY.\r\n\r\n                                             MONTICELLO, November 23, 1814.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I solicited, on a former occasion, permission from the American\r\nPhilosophical Society, to retire from the honor of their chair, under\r\na consciousness that distance as well as other circumstances, denied\r\nme the power of executing the duties of the station, and that those on\r\nwhom they devolved were best entitled to the honors they confer. It was\r\nthe pleasure of the society at that time, that I should remain in their\r\nservice, and they have continued since to renew the same marks of their\r\npartiality. Of these I have been ever duly sensible, and now beg leave\r\nto return my thanks for them with humble gratitude. Still, I have never\r\nceased, nor can I cease to feel that I am holding honors without yielding\r\nrequital, and justly belonging to others. As the period of election is\r\nnow therefore approaching, I take the occasion of begging to be withdrawn\r\nfrom the attention of the society at their ensuing choice, and to be\r\npermitted now to resign the office of president into their hands, which\r\nI hereby do. I shall consider myself sufficiently honored in remaining\r\na private member of their body, and shall ever avail myself with zeal\r\nof every occasion which may occur, of being useful to them, retaining\r\nindelibly a profound sense of their past favors.\r\n\r\nI avail myself of the channel through which the last notification of the\r\npleasure of the society was conveyed to me, to make this communication,\r\nand with the greater satisfaction, as it gratifies me with the occasion\r\nof assuring you personally of my high respect for yourself, and of the\r\ninterest I shall ever take in learning that your worth and talents secure\r\nto you the successes they merit.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO W. SHORT, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                             MONTICELLO, November 28, 1814.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Yours of October 28th came to hand on the 15th instant only.\r\nThe settlement of your boundary with Colonel Monroe, is protracted\r\nby circumstances which seem foreign to it. One would hardly have\r\nexpected that the hostile expedition to Washington could have had any\r\nconnection with an operation one hundred miles distant. Yet preventing\r\nhis attendance, nothing could be done. I am satisfied there is no\r\nunwillingness on his part, but on the contrary a desire to have it\r\nsettled; and therefore, if he should think it indispensable to be present\r\nat the investigation, as is possible, the very first time he comes here\r\nI will press him to give a day to the decision, without regarding Mr.\r\nCarter's absence. Such an occasion must certainly offer soon after the\r\nfourth of March, when Congress rises of necessity and be assured I will\r\nnot lose one possible moment in effecting it.\r\n\r\nAlthough withdrawn from all anxious attention to political concerns,\r\nyet I will state my impressions as to the present war, because your\r\nletter leads to the subject. The essential grounds of the war were, 1st,\r\nthe orders of council; and 2d, the impressment of our citizens; (for I\r\nput out of sight from the love of peace the multiplied insults on our\r\ngovernment and aggressions on our commerce, with which our pouch, like the\r\nIndian's, had long been filled to the mouth.) What immediately produced\r\nthe declaration was, 1st, the proclamation of the Prince Regent that he\r\nwould never repeal the orders of council as to us, until Bonaparte should\r\nhave revoked his decrees as to all other nations as well as ours; and\r\n2d, the declaration of his minister to ours that no arrangement whatever\r\ncould be devised, admissible in lieu of impressment. It was certainly a\r\nmisfortune that _they_ did not know themselves at the date of this silly\r\nand insolent proclamation, that within one month they would repeal the\r\norders, and that _we_, at the date of our declaration, could not know\r\nof the repeal which was then going on one thousand leagues distant.\r\nTheir determinations, as declared by themselves, could alone guide us,\r\nand they shut the door on all further negotiation, throwing down to us\r\nthe gauntlet of war or submission as the only alternatives. We cannot\r\nblame the government for choosing that of war, because certainly the\r\ngreat majority of the nation thought it ought to be chosen, not that\r\nthey were to gain by it in dollars and cents; all men know that war is\r\na losing game to both parties. But they know also that if they do not\r\nresist encroachment at some point, all will be taken from them, and\r\nthat more would then be lost even in dollars and cents by submission\r\nthan resistance. It is the case of giving a part to save the whole, a\r\nlimb to save life. It is the melancholy law of human societies to be\r\ncompelled sometimes to choose a great evil in order to ward off a greater;\r\nto deter their neighbors from rapine by making it cost them more than\r\nhonest gains. The enemy are accordingly now disgorging what they had so\r\nravenously swallowed. The orders of council had taken from us near one\r\nthousand vessels. Our list of captures from them is now one thousand\r\nthree hundred, and, just become sensible that it is small and not large\r\nships which gall them most, we shall probably add one thousand prizes\r\na year to their past losses. Again, supposing that, according to the\r\nconfession of their own minister in parliament, the Americans they had\r\nimpressed were something short of two thousand, the war against us alone\r\ncannot cost them less than twenty millions of dollars a year, so that each\r\nAmerican impressed has already cost them ten thousand dollars, and every\r\nyear will add five thousand dollars more to his price. We, I suppose,\r\nexpend more; but had we adopted the other alternative of submission, no\r\nmortal can tell what the cost would have been. I consider the war then\r\nas entirely justifiable on our part, although I am still sensible it is\r\na deplorable misfortune to us. It has arrested the course of the most\r\nremarkable tide of prosperity any nation ever experienced, and has closed\r\nsuch prospects of future improvement as were never before in the view\r\nof any people. Farewell all hopes of extinguishing public debt! farewell\r\nall visions of applying surpluses of revenue to the improvements of peace\r\nrather than the ravages of war. Our enemy has indeed the consolation of\r\nSatan on removing our first parents from Paradise: from a peaceable and\r\nagricultural nation, he makes us a military and manufacturing one. We\r\nshall indeed survive the conflict. Breeders enough will remain to carry\r\non population. We shall retain our country, and rapid advances in the art\r\nof war will soon enable us to beat our enemy, and probably drive him from\r\nthe continent. We have men enough, and I am in hopes the present session\r\nof Congress will provide the means of commanding their services. But I\r\nwish I could see them get into a better train of finance. Their banking\r\nprojects are like dosing dropsy with more water. If anything could revolt\r\nour citizens against the war, it would be the extravagance with which\r\nthey are about to be taxed. It is strange indeed that at this day, and\r\nin a country where English proceedings are so familiar, the principles\r\nand advantages of funding should be neglected, and expedients resorted\r\nto. Their new bank, if not abortive at its birth, will not last through\r\none campaign; and the taxes proposed cannot be paid. How can a people who\r\ncannot get fifty cents a bushel for their wheat, while they pay twelve\r\ndollars a bushel for their salt, pay five times the amount of taxes they\r\never paid before? Yet that will be the case in all the States south of\r\nthe Potomac. Our resources are competent to the maintenance of the war\r\nif duly economized and skillfuly employed in the way of anticipation.\r\nHowever, we must suffer, I suppose, from our ignorance in funding, as\r\nwe did from that of fighting, until necessity teaches us both; and,\r\nfortunately, our stamina are so vigorous as to rise superior to great\r\nmismanagement. This year I think we shall have learnt how to call forth\r\nour force, and by the next I hope our funds, and even if the state of\r\nEurope should not by that time give the enemy employment enough nearer\r\nhome, we shall leave him nothing to fight for here. These are my views\r\nof the war. They embrace a great deal of sufferance, trying privations,\r\nand no benefit but that of teaching our enemy that he is never to gain by\r\nwanton injuries on us. To me this state of things brings a sacrifice of\r\nall tranquillity and comfort through the residue of life. For although\r\nthe debility of age disables me from the services and sufferings of the\r\nfield, yet, by the total annihilation in value of the produce which was\r\nto give me subsistence and independence, I shall be like Tantalus, up\r\nto the shoulders in water, yet dying with thirst. We can make indeed\r\nenough to eat, drink and clothe ourselves; but nothing for our salt,\r\niron, groceries and taxes, which must be paid in money. For what can\r\nwe raise for the market? Wheat? we can only give it to our horses, as\r\nwe have been doing ever since harvest. Tobacco? it is not worth the\r\npipe it is smoked in. Some say Whiskey; but all mankind must become\r\ndrunkards to consume it. But although we feel, we shall not flinch. We\r\nmust consider now, as in the revolutionary war, that although the evils\r\nof resistance are great, those of submission would be greater. We must\r\nmeet, therefore, the former as the casualties of tempests and earthquakes,\r\nand like them necessarily resulting from the constitution of the world.\r\nYour situation, my dear friend, is much better. For, although I do not\r\nknow with certainty the nature of your investments, yet I presume they\r\nare not in banks, insurance companies or any other of those gossamer\r\ncastles. If in ground-rents, they are solid; if in stock of the United\r\nStates, they are equally so. I once thought that in the event of a war\r\nwe should be obliged to suspend paying the interest of the public debt.\r\nBut a dozen years more of experience and observation on our people and\r\ngovernment, have satisfied me it will never be done. The sense of the\r\nnecessity of public credit is so universal and so deeply rooted, that\r\nno other necessity will prevail against it; and I am glad to see that\r\nwhile the former eight millions are steadfastly applied to the sinking\r\nof the old debt, the Senate have lately insisted on a sinking fund for\r\nthe new. This is the dawn of that improvement in the management of our\r\nfinances which I look to for salvation; and I trust that the light will\r\ncontinue to advance, and point out their way to our legislators. They\r\nwill soon see that instead of taxes for the whole year's expenses,\r\nwhich the people cannot pay, a tax to the amount of the interest and\r\na reasonable portion of the principal will command the whole sum, and\r\nthrow a part of the burthens of war on times of peace and prosperity.\r\nA sacred payment of interest is the only way to make the most of their\r\nresources, and a sense of that renders your income from our funds more\r\ncertain than mine from lands. Some apprehend danger from the defection\r\nof Massachusetts. It is a disagreeable circumstance, but not a dangerous\r\none. If they become neutral, we are sufficient for one enemy without\r\nthem, and in fact we get no aid from them now. If their administration\r\ndetermines to join the enemy, their force will be annihilated by equality\r\nof division among themselves. Their federalists will then call in the\r\nEnglish army, the republicans ours, and it will only be a transfer of\r\nthe scene of war from Canada to Massachusetts; and we can get ten men to\r\ngo to Massachusetts for one who will go to Canada. Every one, too, must\r\nknow that we can at any moment make peace with England at the expense\r\nof the navigation and fisheries of Massachusetts. But it will not come\r\nto this. Their own people will put down these factionists as soon as\r\nthey see the real object of their opposition; and of this Vermont, New\r\nHampshire, and even Connecticut itself, furnish proofs.\r\n\r\nYou intimate a possibility of your return to France, now that Bonaparte\r\nis put down. I do not wonder at it, France, freed from that monster,\r\nmust again become the most agreeable country on earth. It would be the\r\nsecond choice of all whose ties of family and fortune gives a preference\r\nto some other one, and the first of all not under those ties. Yet I doubt\r\nif the tranquillity of France is entirely settled. If her Pretorian bands\r\nare not furnished with employment on her external enemies, I fear they\r\nwill recall the old, or set up some new cause.\r\n\r\nGod bless you and preserve you in bodily health. Tranquillity of mind\r\ndepends much on ourselves, and greatly on due reflection \"how much pain\r\nhave cost us the evils which have never happened.\" Affectionately adieu.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. MELLISH.\r\n\r\n                                             MONTICELLO, December 10, 1814.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I thank you for your favor of the map of the _sine quâ non_,\r\nenclosed in your letter of November 12th. It was an excellent idea;\r\nand if, with the Documents distributed by Congress, copies of these\r\nhad been sent to be posted up in every street, on every townhouse and\r\ncourt-house, it would have painted to the eyes of those who cannot read\r\nwithout reflecting, that reconquest is the ultimate object of Britain.\r\nThe first step towards this is to set a limit to their expansion by\r\ntaking from them that noble country which the foresight of their fathers\r\nprovided for their multiplying and needy offspring; to be followed up by\r\nthe compression, land-board and sea-board, of that Omnipotence which the\r\nEnglish fancy themselves now to possess. A vain and foolish imagination!\r\nInstead of fearing and endeavoring to crush our prosperity, had they\r\ncultivated it in friendship, it might have become a bulwark instead of a\r\nbreaker to them. There has never been an administration in this country\r\nwhich would not gladly have met them more than half way on the road to\r\nan equal, a just and solid connection of friendship and intercourse.\r\nAnd as to repressing our growth, they might as well attempt to repress\r\nthe waves of the ocean.\r\n\r\nYour American Atlas is a useful undertaking for those who will live to see\r\nand to use it. To me every mail, in the departure of some cotemporary,\r\nbrings warning to be in readiness myself also, and to cease from new\r\nengagements. It is a warning of no alarm. When faculty after faculty\r\nis retiring from us, and all the avenues to cheerful sensation closing,\r\nsight failing now, hearing next, then memory, debility of body, trepitude\r\nof mind, nothing remaining but a sickly vegetation, with scarcely the\r\nrelief of a little locomotion, the last cannot be but a _coup de grace_.\r\n\r\nYou propose to me the preparation of a new edition of the Notes on\r\nVirginia. I formerly entertained the idea, and from time to time noted\r\nsome new matter, which I thought I would arrange at leisure for a\r\nposthumous edition. But I now begin to see that it is impracticable for\r\nme. Nearly forty years of additional experience in the affairs of mankind\r\nwould lead me into dilatations ending I know not where. That experience\r\nindeed has not altered a single principle. But it has furnished matter\r\nof abundant development. Every moment, too, which I have to spare from\r\nmy daily exercise and affairs is engrossed by a correspondence, the\r\nresult of the extensive relations which my course of life has necessarily\r\noccasioned. And now the act of writing itself is becoming slow, laborious\r\nand irksome. I consider, therefore, the idea of preparing a new copy of\r\nthat work as no more to be entertained. The work itself indeed is nothing\r\nmore than the measure of a shadow, never stationary, but lengthening as\r\nthe sun advances, and to be taken anew from hour to hour. It must remain,\r\ntherefore, for some other hand to sketch its appearance at another epoch,\r\nto furnish another element for calculating the course and motion of this\r\nmember of our federal system. For this, every day is adding new matter\r\nand strange matter. That of reducing, by impulse instead of attraction,\r\na sister planet into its orbit, will be as new in our political as in\r\nthe planetary system. The operation, however, will be painful rather\r\nthan difficult. The sound part of our wandering star will probably, by\r\nits own internal energies, keep the unsound within its course; or if a\r\nforeign power is called in, we shall have to meet it but so much the\r\nnearer, and with a more overwhelming force. It will probably shorten\r\nthe war. For I think it probable that the _sine quâ non_ was designedly\r\nput into an impossible form to give time for the development of their\r\nplots and concerts with the factionists of Boston, and that they are\r\nholding off to see the issue, not of the Congress of Vienna, but that\r\nof Hartford. This will begin a new chapter in our history, and with a\r\nwish that you may live in health to see its easy close, I tender you\r\nthe assurance of my great esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. CORREA DE SERRA.\r\n\r\n                                             MONTICELLO, December 27, 1814.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Yours of the 9th has been duly received, and I thank you\r\nfor the recipe for imitating purrolani, which I shall certainly try on\r\nmy cisterns the ensuing summer. The making them impermeable to water\r\nis of great consequence to me. That one chemical subject may follow\r\nanother, I enclose you two morsels of ore found in this neighborhood,\r\nand supposed to be of antimony. I am not certain, but I believe both are\r\nfrom the same piece, and although the very spot where that was found is\r\nnot known, yet it is known to be within a certain space not too large\r\nto be minutely examined, if the material be worth it. This you can have\r\nascertained in Philadelphia, where it is best known to the artists how\r\ngreat a desideratum antimony is with them.\r\n\r\nYou will have seen that I resigned the chair of the American Philosophical\r\nSociety, not awaiting your further information as to the settlement of\r\nthe general opinion on a successor without schism. I did it because the\r\nterm of election was too near to admit further delay.\r\n\r\nOn the subject which entered incidentally into our conversation while\r\nyou were here, when I came to reflect maturely, I concluded to be silent.\r\nTo do wrong is a melancholy resource, even where retaliation renders it\r\nindispensably necessary. It is better to suffer much from the scalpings,\r\nthe conflagrations, the rapes and rapine of savages, than to countenance\r\nand strengthen such barbarisms by retortion. I have ever deemed it more\r\nhonorable and more profitable too, to set a good example than to follow\r\na bad one. The good opinion of mankind, like the lever of Archimedes,\r\nwith the given fulcrum, moves the world. I therefore have never proposed\r\nor mentioned the subject to any one.\r\n\r\nI have received a letter from Mr. Say, in which he expresses a thought of\r\nremoving to this country, having discontinued the manufactory in which\r\nhe was engaged; and he asks information from me of the prices of land,\r\nlabor, produce, &c., in the neighborhood of Charlottesville, on which he\r\nhas cast his eye. Its neighborhood has certainly the advantages of good\r\nsoil, fine climate, navigation to market, and rational and republican\r\nsociety. It would be a good enough position too for the re-establishment\r\nof his cotton works, on a moderate scale, and combined with the small\r\nplan of agriculture to which he seems solely to look. But when called\r\non to name prices, what is to be said? We have no fixed prices now. Our\r\ndropsical medium is long since divested of the quality of a medium of\r\nvalue; nor can I find any other. In most countries a fixed quantity of\r\nwheat is perhaps the best permanent standard. But here the blockade of\r\nour whole coast, preventing all access to a market, has depressed the\r\nprice of that, and exalted that of other things, in opposite directions,\r\nand, combined with the effects of the paper deluge, leaves really no\r\ncommon measure of values to be resorted to. This paper, too, received now\r\nwithout confidence, and for momentary purposes only, may, in a moment,\r\nbe worth nothing. I shall think further on the subject, and give to Mr.\r\nSay the best information in my power. To myself such an addition to our\r\nrural society would be inestimable; and I can readily conceive that it\r\nmay be for the benefit of his children and their descendants to remove\r\nto a country where, for enterprise and talents, so many avenues are open\r\nto fortune and fame. But whether, at his time of life, and with habits\r\nformed for the state of society in France, a change for one so entirely\r\ndifferent will be for his personal happiness, you can better judge than\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\nMr. Say will be surprised to find, that forty years after the development\r\nof sound financial principles by Adam Smith and the Economists, and a\r\ndozen years after he has given them to us in a corrected, dense, and\r\nlucid form, there should be so much ignorance of them in our country;\r\nthat instead of funding issues of paper on the hypothecation of specific\r\nredeeming taxes, (the only method of anticipating, in a time of war,\r\nthe resources of times of peace, tested by the experience of nations,)\r\nwe are trusting to tricks of jugglers on the cards, to the illusions of\r\nbanking schemes for the resources of the war, and for the cure of colic\r\nto inflations of more wind. The wise proposition of the Secretary at War,\r\ntoo, for filling our ranks with regulars, and putting our militia into\r\nan effective form, seems to be laid aside. I fear, therefore, that, if\r\nthe war continues, it will require another year of sufferance for men\r\nand money to lead our legislators into such a military and financial\r\nregimen as may carry us through a war of any length. But my hope is in\r\npeace. The negotiators at Ghent are agreed now on every point save one,\r\nthe demand and cession of a portion of Maine. This, it is well known,\r\ncannot be yielded by us, nor deemed by them an object for continuing\r\na war so expensive, so injurious to their commerce and manufactures,\r\nand so odious in the eyes of the world. But it is a thread to hold by\r\nuntil they can hear the result, not of the Congress of Vienna, but of\r\nHartford. When they shall know, as they will know, that nothing will be\r\ndone there, they will let go their hold, and complete the peace of the\r\nworld, by agreeing to the _status ante bellum_. Indemnity for the past,\r\nand security for the future, which was our motto at the beginning of\r\nthis war, must be adjourned to another, when, disarmed and bankrupt, our\r\nenemy shall be less able to insult and plunder the world with impunity.\r\nThis will be after my time. One war, such as that of our Revolution, is\r\nenough for one life. Mine has been too much prolonged to make me the\r\nwitness of a second, and I hope for a _coup de grace_ before a third\r\nshall come upon us. If, indeed, Europe has matters to settle which may\r\nreduce this _hostis humani generis_ to a state of peace and moral order,\r\nI shall see that with pleasure, and then sing, with old Simeon, _nunc\r\ndimittas Domine_. For yourself, _cura ut valeas, et me, ut amaris, ama_.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL MONROE.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, January 1, 1815.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your letters of November the 30th and December the 21st have\r\nbeen received with great pleasure. A truth now and then projecting into\r\nthe ocean of newspaper lies, serves like head-lands to correct our course.\r\nIndeed, my scepticism as to everything I see in a newspaper, makes me\r\nindifferent whether I ever see one. The embarrassments at Washington,\r\nin August last, I expected would be great in any state of things; but\r\nthey proved greater than expected. I never doubted that the plans of\r\nthe President were wise and sufficient. Their failure we all impute, 1,\r\nto the insubordinate temper of Armstrong; and 2, to the indecision of\r\nWinder. However, it ends well. It mortifies ourselves, and so may check,\r\nperhaps, the silly boasting spirit of our newspapers, and it enlists the\r\nfeelings of the world on our side; and the advantage of public opinion\r\nis like that of the weather-gauge in a naval action. In Europe, the\r\ntransient possession of our Capital can be no disgrace. Nearly every\r\nCapital there was in possession of its enemy; some often and long. But\r\ndiabolical as they paint that enemy, he burnt neither public edifices nor\r\nprivate dwellings. It was reserved for England to show that Bonaparte,\r\nin atrocity, was an infant to their ministers and their generals. They\r\nare taking his place in the eyes of Europe, and have turned into our\r\nchannel all its good will. This will be worth the million of dollars the\r\nrepairs of their conflagration will cost us. I hope that to preserve\r\nthis weather-gauge of public opinion, and to counteract the slanders\r\nand falsehoods disseminated by the English papers, the government will\r\nmake it a standing instruction to their ministers at foreign courts, to\r\nkeep Europe truly informed of occurrences here, by publishing in their\r\npapers the naked truth always, whether favorable or unfavorable. For\r\nthey will believe the good, if we candidly tell them the bad also.\r\n\r\nBut you have two more serious causes of uneasiness; the want of men and\r\nmoney. For the former, nothing more wise or efficient could have been\r\nimagined than what you proposed. It would have filled our ranks with\r\nregulars, and that, too, by throwing a just share of the burthen on the\r\npurses of those whose persons are exempt either by age or office; and it\r\nwould have rendered our militia, like those of the Greeks and Romans,\r\na nation of warriors. But the go-by seems to have been given to your\r\nproposition, and longer sufferance is necessary to force us to what is\r\nbest. We seem equally incorrigible to our financial course. Although\r\na century of British experience has proved to what a wonderful extent\r\nthe funding on specific redeeming taxes enables a nation to anticipate\r\nin war the resources of peace, and although the other nations of Europe\r\nhave tried and trodden every path of force or folly in fruitless quest\r\nof the same object, yet we still expect to find in juggling tricks and\r\nbanking dreams, that money can be made out of nothing, and in sufficient\r\nquantity to meet the expenses of a heavy war by sea and land. It is said,\r\nindeed, that money cannot be borrowed from our merchants as from those\r\nof England. But it can be borrowed from our people. They will give you\r\nall the necessaries of war they produce, if, instead of the bankrupt\r\ntrash they now are obliged to receive for want of any other, you will\r\ngive them a paper promise funded on a specific pledge, and of a size\r\nfor common circulation. But you say the merchants will not take this\r\npaper. What the people take the merchants must take, or sell nothing.\r\nAll these doubts and fears prove only the extent of the dominion which\r\nthe banking institutions have obtained over the minds of our citizens,\r\nand especially of those inhabiting cities or other banking places;\r\nand this dominion must be broken, or it will break us. But here, as in\r\nthe other case, we must make up our minds to suffer yet longer before\r\nwe can get right. The misfortune is, that in the meantime we shall\r\nplunge ourselves in unextinguishable debt, and entail on our posterity\r\nan inheritance of eternal taxes, which will bring our government and\r\npeople into the condition of those of England, a nation of pikes and\r\ngudgeons, the latter bred merely as food for the former. But, however\r\nthese difficulties of men and money may be disposed of, it is fortunate\r\nthat neither of them will affect our war by sea. Privateers will find\r\ntheir own men and money. Let nothing be spared to encourage them. They\r\nare the dagger which strikes at the heart of the enemy, their commerce.\r\nFrigates and seventy-fours are a sacrifice we must make, heavy as it is,\r\nto the prejudices of a part of our citizens. They have, indeed, rendered\r\na great moral service, which has delighted me as much as any one in the\r\nUnited States. But they have had no physical effect sensible to the enemy;\r\nand now, while we must fortify them in our harbors, and keep armies to\r\ndefend them, our _privateers_ are bearding and blockading the enemy in\r\ntheir own seaports. Encourage them to burn all their prizes, and let the\r\npublic pay for them. They will cheat us enormously. No matter; they will\r\nmake the merchants of England feel, and squeal, and cry out for peace.\r\n\r\nI much regretted your acceptance of the war department. Not that I know\r\na person who I think would better conduct it. But, conduct it ever so\r\nwisely, it will be a sacrifice of yourself. Were an angel from Heaven\r\nto undertake that office, all our miscarriages would be ascribed to\r\nhim. Raw troops, no troops, insubordinate militia, want of arms, want of\r\nmoney, want of provisions, all will be charged to want of management in\r\nyou. I speak from experience, when I was Governor of Virginia. Without\r\na regular in the State, and scarcely a musket to put into the hands\r\nof the militia, invaded by two armies, Arnold's from the sea-board and\r\nCornwallis' from the southward, when we were driven from Richmond and\r\nCharlottesville, and every member of my council fled from their homes,\r\nit was not the total destitution of means, but the mismanagement of them,\r\nwhich, in the querulous voice of the public, caused all our misfortunes.\r\nIt ended, indeed, in the capture of the whole hostile force, but not till\r\nmeans were brought us by General Washington's army, and the French fleet\r\nand army. And although the legislature, who were personally intimate\r\nwith both the means and measures, acquitted me with justice and thanks,\r\nyet General Lee has put all those imputations among the romances of\r\nhis historical novel, for the amusement of credulous and uninquisitive\r\nreaders. Not that I have seen the least disposition to censure you.\r\nOn the contrary, your conduct on the attack of Washington has met the\r\npraises of every one, and your plan for regulars and militia, their\r\napprobation. But no campaign is as yet opened. No Generals have yet an\r\ninterest in shifting their own incompetence on you, no army agents their\r\nrogueries. I sincerely pray you may never meet censure where you will\r\ndeserve most praise, and that your own happiness and prosperity may be\r\nthe result of your patriotic services.\r\n\r\nEver and affectionately yours.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GIRARDIN.\r\n\r\n                                              MONTICELLO, January 15, 1815.\r\n\r\nI have no document respecting Clarke's expedition, except the letters of\r\nwhich you are in possession, one of which, I believe, gives some account\r\nof it; nor do I possess Imlay's history of Kentucky.\r\n\r\nOf Mr. Wythe's early history I scarcely know anything, except that he\r\nwas self-taught; and perhaps this might not have been as to the Latin\r\nlanguage, Dr. Small was his bosom friend, and to me as a father. To his\r\nenlightened and affectionate guidance of my studies while at College,\r\nI am indebted for everything.\r\n\r\nHe was Professor of Mathematics at William and Mary, and, for some time,\r\nwas in the philosophical chair. He first introduced into both schools\r\nrational and elevated courses of study, and, from an extraordinary\r\nconjunction of eloquence and logic, was enabled to communicate them to\r\nthe students with great effect. He procured for me the patronage of Mr.\r\nWythe, and both of them, the attentions of Governor Fauquier, the ablest\r\nman who ever filled the chair of government here. They were inseparable\r\nfriends, and at their frequent dinners with the Governor, (after his\r\nfamily had returned to England,) he admitted me always, to make it a\r\n_partie quarrée_. At these dinners I have heard more good sense, more\r\nrational and philosophical conversations, than in all my life besides.\r\nThey were truly Attic societies. The Governor was musical also, and a\r\ngood performer, and associated me with two or three other amateurs in\r\nhis weekly concerts. He merits honorable mention in your history, if any\r\nproper occasion offers. So also does Dabney Carr, father of Peter Carr,\r\nmover of the proposition of March, 1773, for committees of correspondence,\r\nthe first fruit of which was the call of an American Congress. I return\r\nyour two pamphlets with my thanks, and salute you with esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CHARLES CLAS, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                              MONTICELLO, January 29, 1815.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your letter of December 20th was four weeks on its way to\r\nme. I thank you for it; for although founded on a misconception, it\r\nis evidence of that friendly concern for my peace and welfare, which\r\nI have ever believed you to feel. Of publishing a book on religion,\r\nmy dear Sir, I never had an idea. I should as soon think of writing\r\nfor the reformation of Bedlam, as of the world of religious sects. Of\r\nthese there must be, at least, ten thousand, every individual of every\r\none of which believes all wrong but his own. To undertake to bring\r\nthem all right, would be like undertaking, single-handed, to fell the\r\nforests of America. Probably you have heard me say I had taken the\r\nfour Evangelists, had cut out from them every text they had recorded\r\nof the moral precepts of Jesus, and arranged them in a certain order,\r\nand although they appeared but as fragments, yet fragments of the most\r\nsublime edifice of morality which had ever been exhibited to man. This\r\nI have probably mentioned to you, because it is true; and the idea of\r\nits publication may have suggested itself as an inference of your own\r\nmind. I not only write nothing on religion, but rarely permit myself to\r\nspeak on it, and never but in a reasonable society. I have probably said\r\nmore to you than to any other person, because we have had more hours\r\nof conversation in _duetto_ in our meetings at the Forest. I abuse the\r\npriests, indeed, who have so much abused the pure and holy doctrines of\r\ntheir master, and who have laid me under no obligations of reticence\r\nas to the tricks of their trade. The genuine system of Jesus, and the\r\nartificial structures they have erected, to make them the instruments\r\nof wealth, power, and preëminence to themselves, are as distinct things\r\nin my view as light and darkness; and while I have classed them with\r\nsoothsayers and necromancers, I place him among the greatest reformers\r\nof morals, and scourges of priest-craft that have ever existed. They\r\nfelt him as such, and never rested until they had silenced him by death.\r\nBut his heresies against Judaism prevailing in the long run, the priests\r\nhave tacked about, and rebuilt upon them the temple which he destroyed,\r\nas splendid, as profitable, and as imposing as that.\r\n\r\nGovernment, as well as religion, has furnished its schisms, its\r\npersecutions, and its devices for flattering idleness on the earnings of\r\nthe people. It has its hierarchy of emperors, kings, princes, and nobles,\r\nas that has of popes, cardinals, archbishops, bishops, and priests.\r\nIn short, cannibals are not to be found in the wilds of America only,\r\nbut are revelling on the blood of every living people. Turning, then,\r\nfrom this loathsome combination of Church and State, and weeping over\r\nthe follies of our fellow men, who yield themselves the willing dupes\r\nand drudges of these mountebanks, I consider reformation and redress as\r\ndesperate, and abandon them to the Quixotism of more enthusiastic minds.\r\n\r\nI have received from Philadelphia, by mail, the spectacles you had\r\ndesired, and now forward them by the same conveyance, as equally safe\r\nand more in time, than were they to await my own going. In a separate\r\ncase is a complete set of glasses, from early use to old age. I think\r\nthe pair now in the frames will suit your eyes, but should they not, you\r\nwill easily change them by the screws. I believe the largest numbers\r\nare the smallest magnifiers, but am not certain. Trial will readily\r\nascertain it. You must do me the favor to accept them as a token of my\r\nfriendship, and with them the assurance of my great esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR PLUMER.\r\n\r\n                                              MONTICELLO, January 31, 1815.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of December 30th has been received. In answer to\r\nyour question whether in the course of my reading I have ever found that\r\nany country or even considerable island was without inhabitants when first\r\ndiscovered? I must answer, with Mr. Adams, in the negative. Although the\r\nfact is curious, it had never before struck my attention. Some small\r\nislands have been found, and are at this day, without inhabitants,\r\nbut this is easily accounted for. Man being a gregarious animal, will\r\nnot remain but where there can be a sufficient herd of his own kind to\r\nsatisfy his social propensities. Add to this that insulated settlements,\r\nif small, would be liable to extirpations by occasional epidemics.\r\n\r\nI thank you for the pamphlet you have been so kind as to send me, and have\r\nread it with much satisfaction. But with those to whom it is addressed\r\nMoses and the prophets have no authority but when administering to their\r\nworldly gain. The paradox with me is how any friend to the union of\r\nour country can, in conscience, contribute a cent to the maintenance of\r\nany one who perverts the sanctity of his desk to the open inculcation\r\nof rebellion, civil war, dissolution of government, and the miseries\r\nof anarchy. When England took alarm lest France, become republican,\r\nshould recover energies dangerous to her, she employed emissaries with\r\nmeans to engage incendiaries and anarchists in the disorganization of\r\nall government there. These, assuming exaggerated zeal for republican\r\ngovernment and the rights of the people, crowded their inscriptions\r\ninto the Jacobin societies, and overwhelming by their majorities the\r\nhonest and enlightened patriots of the original institution, distorted\r\nits objects, pursued its genuine founders under the name of Brissotines\r\nand Girondists unto death, intrigued themselves into the municipality\r\nof Paris, controlled by terrorism the proceedings of the legislature,\r\nin which they were faithfully aided by their costipendaries there, the\r\nDantons and Marats of the Mountain, murdered their king, septembrized\r\nthe nation, and thus accomplished their stipulated task of demolishing\r\nliberty and government with it. England now fears the rising force of\r\nthis republican nation, and by the same means is endeavoring to effect\r\nthe same course of miseries and destruction here; it is impossible\r\nwhere one sees like courses of events commence, not to ascribe them\r\nto like causes. We know that the government of England, maintaining\r\nitself by corruption at home, uses the same means in other countries of\r\nwhich she has any jealousy, by subsidizing agitators and traitors among\r\nthemselves to distract and paralyze them. She sufficiently manifests\r\nthat she has no disposition to spare ours. We see in the proceedings\r\nof Massachusetts, symptoms which plainly indicate such a course, and we\r\nknow as far as such practices can ever be dragged into light, that she\r\nhas practiced, and with success, on leading individuals of that State.\r\nNay further, we see those individuals acting on the very plan which our\r\ninformation had warned us was settled between the parties. These elements\r\nof explanation history cannot fail of putting together in recording the\r\ncrime of combining with the oppressors of the earth to extinguish the\r\nlast spark of human hope, that here, at length, will be preserved a model\r\nof government, securing to man his rights and the fruits of his labor,\r\nby an organization constantly subject to his own will. The crime indeed,\r\nif accomplished, would immortalize its perpetrators, and their names\r\nwould descend in history with those of Robespierre and his associates, as\r\nthe guardian genii of despotism, and demons of human liberty. I do not\r\nmean to say that all who are acting with these men are under the same\r\nmotives. I know some of them personally to be incapable of it. Nor was\r\nthat the case with the disorganizers and assassins of Paris. Delusions\r\nthere, and party perversions here, furnish unconscious assistants to the\r\nhired actors in these atrocious scenes. But I have never entertained one\r\nmoment's fear on this subject. The people of this country enjoy too much\r\nhappiness to risk it for nothing; and I have never doubted that whenever\r\nthe incendiaries of Massachusetts should venture openly to raise the\r\nstandard of separation, its citizens would rise in mass and do justice\r\nthemselves to their own parricides.\r\n\r\nI am glad to learn that you persevere in your historical work. I am\r\nsure it will be executed on sound principles of Americanism, and I hope\r\nyour opportunities will enable you to make the abortive crimes of the\r\npresent, useful as a lesson for future times.\r\n\r\nIn aid of your general work I possess no materials whatever, or they\r\nshould be entirely at your service; and I am sorry that I have not a\r\nsingle copy of the pamphlet you ask, entitled \"A Summary View of the\r\nRights of British America.\" It was the draught of an instruction which\r\nI had meant to propose for our delegates to the first Congress. Being\r\nprevented by sickness from attending our convention, I sent it to them,\r\nand they printed without adopting it, in the hope that conciliation was\r\nnot yet desperate. Its only merit was in being the first publication\r\nwhich carried the claim of our rights their whole length, and asserted\r\nthat there was no rightful link of connection between us and England but\r\nthat of being under the same king. Haring's collection of our statutes\r\nis published, I know, as far as the third volume, bringing them down to\r\n1710; and I rather believe a fourth has appeared. One more will probably\r\ncomplete the work of the revolution, and will be to us an inestimable\r\ntreasure, as being the only collection of all the acts of our legislatures\r\nnow extant in print or manuscript.\r\n\r\nAccept the assurance of my great esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN VAUGHAN, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                              MONTICELLO, February 5, 1815.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your very friendly letter of January 4th is but just received,\r\nand I am much gratified by the interest taken by yourself, and others\r\nof my colleagues of the Philosophical Society, in what concerned myself\r\non withdrawing from the presidency of the Society. My desire to do so\r\nhad been so long known to every member, and the continuance of it to\r\nsome, that I did not suppose it can be misunderstood by the public.\r\nSetting aside the consideration of distance, which must be obvious to\r\nall, nothing is more incumbent on the old, than to know when they should\r\nget out of the way, and relinquish to younger successors the honors they\r\ncan no longer earn, and the duties they can no longer perform. I rejoice\r\nin the election of Dr. Wistar, and trust that his senior standing in\r\nthe society will have been considered as a fair motive of preference of\r\nthose whose merits, standing alone, would have justly entitled them to\r\nthe honor, and who, as juniors, according to the course of nature, may\r\nstill expect their turn.\r\n\r\nI have received, with very great pleasure, the visit of Mr. Ticknor,\r\nand find him highly distinguished by science and good sense. He\r\nwas accompanied by Mr. Gray, son of the late Lieutenant Governor of\r\nMassachusetts, of great information and promise also. It gives me\r\nineffable comfort to see such subjects coming forward to take charge of\r\nthe political and civil rights, the establishment of which has cost us\r\nsuch sacrifices. Mr. Ticknor will be fortunate if he can get under the\r\nwing of Mr. Correa; and, if the happiness of Mr. Correa requires (as\r\nI suppose it does) his return to Europe, we must sacrifice it to that\r\nwhich his residence here would have given us, and acquiesce under the\r\nregrets which our transient acquaintance with his worth cannot fail to\r\nembody with our future recollections of him. Of Michaux's work I possess\r\nthree volumes, or rather _catriers_, one on Oaks, another on Beeches\r\nand Birches, and a third on Pines.\r\n\r\nI salute you with great friendship and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY MR. CRAWFORD.\r\n\r\n                                             MONTICELLO, February 11, 1815.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have to thank you for your letter of June 16th. It presents\r\nthose special views of the state of things in Europe, for which we look\r\nin vain into newspapers. They tell us only of the downfall of Bonaparte,\r\nbut nothing of the temper, the views, the secret workings of the high\r\nagents in these transactions. Although we neither expected, nor wished\r\nany act of friendship from Bonaparte, and always detested him as a\r\ntyrant, yet he gave employment to much of the force of the nation who\r\nwas our common enemy. So far, his downfall was illy timed for us; it\r\ngave to England an opportunity to turn full-handed on us, when we were\r\nunprepared. No matter, we can beat her on our own soil, leaving the laws\r\nof the ocean to be settled by the maritime powers of Europe, who are\r\nequally oppressed and insulted by the usurpations of England on that\r\nelement. Our particular and separate grievance is only the impressment\r\nof our citizens. We must sacrifice the last dollar and drop of blood to\r\nrid us of that badge of slavery; and it must rest with England alone to\r\nsay whether it is worth eternal war, for eternal it must be if she holds\r\nto the wrong. She will probably find that the six thousand citizens she\r\ntook from us by impressment have already cost her ten thousand guineas a\r\nman, and will cost her, in addition, the half of that annually, during\r\nthe continuance of the war, besides the captures on the ocean, and the\r\nloss of our commerce. She might certainly find cheaper means of manning\r\nher fleet, or, if to be manned at this expense, her fleet will break\r\nher down. The first year of our warfare by land was disastrous. Detroit,\r\nQueenstown, Frenchtown, and Beaver Dam, witness that. But the second was\r\ngenerally successful, and the third entirely so, both by sea and land.\r\nFor I set down the _coup de main_ at Washington as more disgraceful to\r\nEngland than to us. The victories of the last year at Chippewa, Niagara,\r\nFort Erie, Plattsburg, and New Orleans, the capture of their two fleets\r\non Lakes Erie and Champlain, and repeated triumphs of our frigates over\r\nhers, whenever engaging with equal force, show that we have officers now\r\nbecoming prominent, and capable of making them feel the superiority of\r\nour means, in a war on our own soil. Our means are abundant both as to\r\nmen and money, wanting only skilful arrangement; and experience alone\r\nbrings skill. As to men, nothing wiser can be devised than what the\r\nSecretary at War (Monroe) proposed in his Report at the commencement of\r\nCongress. It would have kept our regular army always of necessity full,\r\nand by classing our militia according to ages, would have put them into\r\na form ready for whatever service, distant or at home, should require\r\nthem. Congress have not adopted it, but their next experiment will lead\r\nto it. Our financial system is, at least, arranged. The fatal possession\r\nof the whole circulating medium by our banks, the excess of those\r\ninstitutions, and their present discredit, cause all our difficulties.\r\nTreasury notes of small as well as high denomination, bottomed on a tax\r\nwhich would redeem them in ten years, would place at our disposal the\r\nwhole circulating medium of the United States; a fund of credit sufficient\r\nto carry us through any probable length of war. A small issue of such\r\npaper is now commencing. It will immediately supersede the bank paper;\r\nnobody receiving that now but for the purposes of the day, and never in\r\npayments which are to lie by for any time. In fact, all the banks having\r\ndeclared they will not give cash in exchange for their own notes, these\r\ncirculate merely because there is no other medium of exchange. As soon\r\nas the treasury notes get into circulation, the others will cease to\r\nhold any competition with them. I trust that another year will confirm\r\nthis experiment, and restore this fund to the public, who ought never\r\nmore to permit its being filched from them by private speculators and\r\ndisorganizers of the circulation.\r\n\r\nDo they send you from Washington the Historical Register of the United\r\nStates? It is published there annually, and gives a succinct and judicious\r\nhistory of the events of the war, not too long to be inserted in the\r\nEuropean newspapers, and would keep the European public truly informed,\r\nby correcting the lying statements of the British papers. It gives, too,\r\nall the public documents of any value. Niles' Weekly Register is also\r\nan excellent repository of facts and documents, and has the advantage\r\nof coming out weekly, whereas the other is yearly.\r\n\r\nThis will be handed you by Mr. Ticknor, a young gentleman of Boston, of\r\nhigh education and great promise. After going through his studies here,\r\nhe goes to Europe to finish them, and to see what is to be seen there.\r\nHe brought me high recommendations from Mr. Adams and others, and from a\r\nstay of some days with me, I was persuaded he merited them, as he will\r\nwhatever attentions you will be so good as to show him. I pray you to\r\naccept the assurance of my great esteem and respect.\r\n\r\nP. S. _February 26th._ On the day of the date of this letter the news\r\nof peace reached Washington, and this place two days after. I am glad\r\nof it, although no provision being made against the impressment of our\r\nseamen, it is in fact but an armistice, to be terminated by the first\r\nact of impressment committed on an American citizen. It may be thought\r\nthat useless blood was spilt at New Orleans, after the treaty of peace\r\nhad been actually signed and ratified. I think it had many valuable\r\nuses. It proved the fidelity of the Orleanese to the United States. It\r\nproved that New Orleans can be defended both by land and water; that the\r\nwestern country will fly to its relief (of which ourselves had doubted\r\nbefore); that our militia are heroes when they have heroes to lead them\r\non; and that, when unembarrassed by field evolutions, which they do not\r\nunderstand, their skill in the fire-arm, and deadly aim, give them great\r\nadvantages over regulars. What nonsense for the manakin Prince Regent\r\nto talk of their conquest of the country east of the Penobscot river!\r\nThen, as in the revolutionary war, their conquests were never more than\r\nof the spot on which their army stood, never extended beyond the range\r\nof their cannon shot. If England is now wise or just enough to settle\r\npeaceably the question of impressment, the late treaty may become one\r\nof peace, and of long peace. We owe to their past follies and wrongs\r\nthe incalculable advantage of being made independent of them for every\r\nmaterial manufacture. These have taken such root, in our private families\r\nespecially, that nothing now can ever extirpate them.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE MARQUIS DE LAFAYETTE.\r\n\r\n                                             MONTICELLO, February 14, 1815.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR FRIEND,--Your letter of August the 14th has been received and\r\nread again, and again, with extraordinary pleasure. It is the first\r\nglimpse which has been furnished me of the interior workings of the late\r\nunexpected but fortunate revolution of your country. The newspapers\r\ntold us only that the great beast was fallen; but what part in this\r\nthe patriots acted, and what the egotists, whether the former slept\r\nwhile the latter were awake to their own interests only, the hireling\r\nscribblers of the English press said little and knew less. I see now\r\nthe mortifying alternative under which the patriot there is placed,\r\nof being either silent, or disgraced by an association in opposition\r\nwith the remains of Bonapartism. A full measure of liberty is not now\r\nperhaps to be expected by your nation, nor am I confident they are\r\nprepared to preserve it. More than a generation will be requisite,\r\nunder the administration of reasonable laws favoring the progress of\r\nknowledge in the general mass of the people, and their habituation to\r\nan independent security of person and property, before they will be\r\ncapable of estimating the value of freedom, and the necessity of a sacred\r\nadherence to the principles on which it rests for preservation. Instead\r\nof that liberty which takes root and growth in the progress of reason,\r\nif recovered by mere force or accident, it becomes, with an unprepared\r\npeople, a tyranny still, of the many, the few, or the one. Possibly\r\nyou may remember, at the date of the _jeu de paume_, how earnestly I\r\nurged yourself and the patriots of my acquaintance, to enter then into\r\na compact with the king, securing freedom of religion, freedom of the\r\npress, trial by jury, _habeas corpus_, and a national legislature, all of\r\nwhich it was known he would then yield, to go home, and let these work\r\non the amelioration of the condition of the people, until they should\r\nhave rendered them capable of more, when occasions would not fail to\r\narise for communicating to them more. This was as much as I then thought\r\nthem able to bear, soberly and usefully for themselves. You thought\r\notherwise, and that the dose might still be larger. And I found you were\r\nright; for subsequent events proved they were equal to the constitution\r\nof 1791. Unfortunately, some of the most honest and enlightened of our\r\npatriotic friends, (but closet politicians merely, unpractised in the\r\nknowledge of man,) thought more could still be obtained and borne. They\r\ndid not weigh the hazards of a transition from one form of government to\r\nanother, the value of what they had already rescued from those hazards,\r\nand might hold in security if they pleased, nor the imprudence of giving\r\nup the certainty of such a degree of liberty, under a limited monarch,\r\nfor the uncertainty of a little more under the form of a republic. You\r\ndiffered from them. You were for stopping there, and for securing the\r\nconstitution which the National Assembly had obtained. Here, too, you\r\nwere right; and from this fatal error of the republicans, from their\r\nseparation from yourself and the constitutionalists, in their councils,\r\nflowed all the subsequent sufferings and crimes of the French nation.\r\nThe hazards of a second change fell upon them by the way. The foreigner\r\ngained time to anarchise by gold the government he could not overthrow\r\nby arms, to crush in their own councils the genuine republicans, by\r\nthe fraternal embraces of exaggerated and hired pretenders, and to turn\r\nthe machine of Jacobinism from the change to the destruction of order;\r\nand, in the end, the limited monarchy they had secured was exchanged\r\nfor the unprincipled and bloody tyranny of Robespierre, and the equally\r\nunprincipled and maniac tyranny of Bonaparte. You are now rid of him,\r\nand I sincerely wish you may continue so. But this may depend on the\r\nwisdom and moderation of the restored dynasty. It is for them now to\r\nread a lesson in the fatal errors of the republicans; to be contented\r\nwith a certain portion of power, secured by formal compact with the\r\nnation, rather than, grasping at more, hazard all upon uncertainty, and\r\nrisk meeting the fate of their predecessor, or a renewal of their own\r\nexile. We are just informed, too, of an example which merits, if true,\r\ntheir most profound contemplation. The gazettes say that Ferdinand of\r\nSpain is dethroned, and his father re-established on the basis of their\r\nnew constitution. This order of magistrates must, therefore, see, that\r\nalthough the attempts at reformation have not succeeded in their whole\r\nlength, and some secession from the ultimate point has taken place, yet\r\nthat men have by no means fallen back to their former passiveness, but\r\non the contrary, that a sense of their rights, and a restlessness to\r\nobtain them, remain deeply impressed on every mind, and, if not quieted\r\nby reasonable relaxations of power, will break out like a volcano on\r\nthe first occasion, and overwhelm everything again in its way. I always\r\nthought the present king an honest and moderate man; and having no issue,\r\nhe is under a motive the less for yielding to personal considerations.\r\nI cannot, therefore, but hope, that the patriots in and out of your\r\nlegislature, acting in phalanx, but temperately and wisely, pressing\r\nunremittingly the principles omitted in the late capitulation of the king,\r\nand watching the occasions which the course of events will create, may\r\nget those principles engrafted into it, and sanctioned by the solemnity\r\nof a national act.\r\n\r\nWith us the affairs of war have taken the most favorable turn which was to\r\nbe expected. Our thirty years of peace had taken off, or superannuated,\r\nall our revolutionary officers of experience and grade; and our first\r\ndraught in the lottery of untried characters had been most unfortunate.\r\nThe delivery of the fort and army of Detroit by the traitor Hull; the\r\ndisgrace at Queenstown, under Van Rensselaer; the massacre at Frenchtown\r\nunder Winchester; and surrender of Boerstler in an open field to one-third\r\nof his own numbers, were the inauspicious beginnings of the first year of\r\nour warfare. The second witnessed but the single miscarriage occasioned\r\nby the disagreement of Wilkinson and Hampton, mentioned in my letter to\r\nyou of November the 30th, 1813, while it gave us the capture of York by\r\nDearborne and Pike; the capture of Fort George by Dearborne also; the\r\ncapture of Proctor's army on the Thames by Harrison, Shelby and Johnson,\r\nand that of the whole British fleet on Lake Erie by Perry. The third\r\nyear has been a continued series of victories, to-wit: of Brown and\r\nScott at Chippewa; of the same at Niagara; of Gaines over Drummond at\r\nFort Erie; that of Brown over Drummond at the same place; the capture\r\nof another fleet on Lake Champlain by M'Donough; the entire defeat of\r\ntheir army under Prevost, on the same day, by M'Comb, and recently their\r\ndefeats at New Orleans by Jackson, Coffee and Carroll, with the loss\r\nof four thousand men out of nine thousand and six hundred, with their\r\ntwo Generals, Packingham and Gibbs killed, and a third, Keane, wounded,\r\nmortally, as is said.\r\n\r\nThis series of successes has been tarnished only by the conflagrations\r\nat Washington, a _coup de main_ differing from that at Richmond, which\r\nyou remember, in the revolutionary war, in the circumstance only, that\r\nwe had, in that case, but forty-eight hours' notice that an enemy had\r\narrived within our capes; whereas, at Washington, there was abundant\r\nprevious notice. The force designated by the President was double of\r\nwhat was necessary; but failed, as is the general opinion, through the\r\ninsubordination of Armstrong, who would never believe the attack intended\r\nuntil it was actually made, and the sluggishness of Winder before the\r\noccasion, and his indecision during it. Still, in the end, the transaction\r\nhas helped rather than hurt us, by arousing the general indignation of our\r\ncountry, and by marking to the world of Europe the Vandalism and brutal\r\ncharacter of the English government. It has merely served to immortalize\r\ntheir infamy. And add further, that through the whole period of the war,\r\nwe have beaten them single-handed at sea, and so thoroughly established\r\nour superiority over them with equal force, that they retire from that\r\nkind of contest, and never suffer their frigates to cruize singly. The\r\nEndymion would never have engaged the frigate President, but knowing\r\nherself backed by three frigates and a razee, who, though somewhat\r\nslower sailers, would get up before she could be taken. The disclosure\r\nto the world of the fatal secret that they can be beaten at sea with an\r\nequal force, the evidence furnished by the military operations of the\r\nlast year that experience is rearing us officers who, when our means\r\nshall be fully under way, will plant our standard on the walls of Quebec\r\nand Halifax, their recent and signal disaster at New Orleans, and the\r\nevaporation of their hopes from the Hartford convention, will probably\r\nraise a clamor in the British nation, which will force their ministry\r\ninto peace. I say _force_ them, because, willingly, they would never\r\nbe at peace. The British ministers find in a state of war rather than\r\nof peace, by riding the various contractors, and receiving _douceurs_\r\non the vast expenditures of the war supplies, that they recruit their\r\nbroken fortunes, or make new ones, and therefore will not make peace as\r\nlong as by any delusions they can keep the temper of the nation up to\r\nthe war point. They found some hopes on the state of our finances. It\r\nis true that the excess of our banking institutions, and their present\r\ndiscredit, have shut us out from the best source of credit we could ever\r\ncommand with certainty. But the foundations of credit still remain to\r\nus, and need but skill which experience will soon produce, to marshal\r\nthem into an order which may carry us through any length of war. But they\r\nhave hoped more in their Hartford convention. Their fears of republican\r\nFrance being now done away, they are directed to republican America,\r\nand they are playing the same game for disorganization here, which they\r\nplayed in your country. The Marats, the Dantons and Robespierres of\r\nMassachusetts are in the same pay, under the same orders, and making the\r\nsame efforts to anarchise us, that their prototypes in France did there.\r\n\r\nI do not say that all who met at Hartford were under the same motives\r\nof money, nor were those of France. Some of them are Outs, and wish to\r\nbe Inns; some the mere dupes of the agitators, or of their own party\r\npassions, while the Maratists alone are in the real secret; but they have\r\nvery different materials to work on. The yeomanry of the United States\r\nare not the _canaille_ of Paris. We might safely give them leave to go\r\nthrough the United States recruiting their ranks, and I am satisfied they\r\ncould not raise one single regiment (gambling merchants and silk-stocking\r\nclerks excepted) who would support them in any effort to separate from\r\nthe Union. The cement of this Union is in the heart-blood of every\r\nAmerican. I do not believe there is on earth a government established\r\non so immovable a basis. Let them, in any State, even in Massachusetts\r\nitself, raise the standard of separation, and its citizens will rise\r\nin mass, and do justice themselves on their own incendiaries. If they\r\ncould have induced the government to some effort of suppression, or\r\neven to enter into discussion with them, it would have given them some\r\nimportance, have brought them into some notice. But they have not been\r\nable to make themselves even a subject of conversation, either of public\r\nor private societies. A silent contempt has been the sole notice they\r\nexcite; consoled, indeed, some of them, by the _palpable_ favors of\r\nPhilip. Have then no fears for us, my friend. The grounds of these exist\r\nonly in English newspapers, edited or endowed by the Castlereaghs or\r\nthe Cannings, or some other such models of pure and uncorrupted virtue.\r\nTheir military heroes, by land and sea, may sink our oyster boats, rob\r\nour hen roosts, burn our negro huts, and run off. But a campaign or\r\ntwo more will relieve them from further trouble or expense in defending\r\ntheir American possessions.\r\n\r\nYou once gave me a copy of the journal of your campaign in Virginia, in\r\n1781, which I must have lent to some one of the undertakers to write the\r\nhistory of the revolutionary war, and forgot to reclaim. I conclude this,\r\nbecause it is no longer among my papers, which I have very diligently\r\nsearched for it, but in vain. An author of real ability is now writing\r\nthat part of the history of Virginia. He does it in my neighborhood, and\r\nI lay open to him all my papers. But I possess none, nor has he any,\r\nwhich can enable him to do justice to your faithful and able services\r\nin that campaign. If you could be so good as to send me another copy,\r\nby the very first vessel bound to any port in the United States, it\r\nmight be here in time; for although he expects to begin to print within\r\na month or two, yet you know the delays of these undertakings. At any\r\nrate it might be got in as a supplement. The old Count Rochambeau gave\r\nme also his _memoire_ of the operations at York, which is gone in the\r\nsame way, and I have no means of applying to his family for it. Perhaps\r\nyou could render them as well as us, the service of procuring another\r\ncopy.\r\n\r\nI learn, with real sorrow, the deaths of Monsieur and Madame de Tessé.\r\nThey made an interesting part in the idle reveries in which I have\r\nsometimes indulged myself, of seeing all my friends of Paris once more,\r\nfor a month or two; a thing impossible, which, however, I never permitted\r\nmyself to despair of. The regrets, however, of seventy-three at the loss\r\nof friends, may be the less, as the time is shorter within which we are\r\nto meet again, according to the creed of our education.\r\n\r\nThis letter will be handed you by Mr. Ticknor, a young gentleman of\r\nBoston, of great erudition, indefatigable industry, and preparation for\r\na life of distinction in his own country. He passed a few days with\r\nme here, brought high recommendations from Mr. Adams and others, and\r\nappeared in every respect to merit them. He is well worthy of those\r\nattentions which you so kindly bestow on our countrymen, and for those\r\nhe may receive I shall join him in acknowledging personal obligations.\r\n\r\nI salute you with assurances of my constant and affectionate friendship\r\nand respect.\r\n\r\nP. S. February 26th. My letter had not yet been sealed, when I received\r\nnews of our peace. I am glad of it, and especially that we closed our\r\nwar with the eclat of the action at New Orleans. But I consider it as an\r\narmistice only, because no security is provided against the impressment\r\nof our seamen. While this is unsettled we are in hostility of mind with\r\nEngland, although actual deeds of arms may be suspended by a truce. If\r\nshe thinks the exercise of this outrage is worth eternal war, eternal\r\nwar it must be, or extermination of the one or the other party. The\r\nfirst act of impressment she commits on an American, will be answered\r\nby reprisal, or by a declaration of war here; and the interval must be\r\nmerely a state of preparation for it. In this we have much to do, in\r\nfurther fortifying our seaport towns, providing military stores, classing\r\nand disciplining our militia, arranging our financial system, and above\r\nall, pushing our domestic manufactures, which have taken such root as\r\nnever again can be shaken. Once more, God bless you.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. DUPONT DE NEMOURS.\r\n\r\n                                             MONTICELLO, February 28, 1815.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR AND RESPECTED FRIEND,--My last to you was of November 29th and\r\nDecember 13th, 14th, since which I have received yours of July 14th.\r\nI have to congratulate you, which I do sincerely on having got back\r\nfrom Robespierre and Bonaparte, to your anti-revolutionary condition.\r\nYou are now nearly where you were at the _jeu de paume_ on the 20th of\r\nJune, 1789. The king would then have yielded, by convention, freedom\r\nof religion, freedom of the press, trial by jury, _habeas corpus_,\r\nand a representative legislature. These I consider as the essentials\r\nconstituting free government, and that the organization of the Executive\r\nis interesting, as it may ensure wisdom and integrity in the first\r\nplace, but next as it may favor or endanger the preservation of these\r\nfundamentals. Although I do not think the late capitulation of the king\r\nquite equal to all this, yet believing his dispositions to be moderate\r\nand friendly to the happiness of the people, and seeing that he is\r\nwithout the bias of issue, I am in hopes your patriots may, by constant\r\nand prudent pressure, obtain from him what is still wanting to give you\r\na temperate degree of freedom and security. Should this not be done, I\r\nshould really apprehend a relapse into discontents, which might again\r\nlet in Bonaparte.\r\n\r\nHere, at length, we have peace. But I view it as an armistice only,\r\nbecause no provision is made against the practice of impressment. As\r\nthis, then, will revive in the first moment of a war in Europe, its\r\nrevival will be a declaration of war here. Our whole business, in the\r\nmeantime, ought to be a sedulous preparation for it, fortifying our\r\nseaports, filling our magazines, classing and disciplining our militia,\r\nforming officers, and above all, establishing a sound system of finance.\r\nYou will see by the want of system in this last department, and even the\r\nwant of principles, how much we are in arrears in that science. With\r\nsufficient means in the hands of our citizens, and sufficient will to\r\nbestow them on the government, we are floundering in expedients equally\r\nunproductive and ruinous; and proving how little are understood here those\r\nsound principles of political economy first developed by the economists,\r\nsince commented and dilated by Smith, Say, yourself, and the luminous\r\nreviewer of Montesquieu. I have been endeavoring to get the able paper\r\non this subject, which you addressed to me in July, 1810, and enlarged\r\nin a copy received the last year, translated and printed here, in order\r\nto draw the attention of our citizens to this subject; but have not as\r\nyet succeeded. Our printers are enterprising only in novels and light\r\nreading. The readers of works of science, although in considerable\r\nnumber, are so sparse in their situations, that such works are of slow\r\ncirculation. But I shall persevere.\r\n\r\nThis letter will be delivered to you by Mr. Ticknor, a young gentleman\r\nfrom Massachusetts, of much erudition and great merit. He has completed\r\nhis course of law and reading, and, before entering on the practice,\r\nproposes to pass two or three years in seeing Europe, and adding to his\r\nstores of knowledge which he can acquire there. Should he enter the career\r\nof politics in his own country, he will go far in obtaining its honors\r\nand powers. He is worthy of any friendly offices you may be so good\r\nas to render him, and to his acknowledgments of them will be added my\r\nown. By him I send you a copy of the Review of Montesquieu, from my own\r\nshelf, the impression being, I believe, exhausted by the late President\r\nof the College of Williamsburg having adopted it as the elementary book\r\nthere. I am persuading the author to permit me to give his name to the\r\npublic, and to permit the original to be printed in Paris. Although your\r\npresses, I observe, are put under the leading strings of your government,\r\nyet this is such a work as would have been licensed at any period, early\r\nor late, of the reign of Louis XVI. Surely the present government will\r\nnot expect to repress the progress of the public mind further back than\r\nthat. I salute you with all veneration and affection.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JEAN BATISTE SAY.\r\n\r\n                                                 MONTICELLO, March 2, 1815.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your letter of June 15th came to hand in December, and it is\r\nnot till the ratification of our peace, that a safe conveyance for an\r\nanswer could be obtained. I thank you for the copy of the new edition\r\nof your work which accompanied your letter. I had considered it in its\r\nfirst form as superseding all other works on that subject; and shall\r\nset proportional value on any improvement of it. I should have been\r\nhappy to have received your son here, as expected from your letter, on\r\nhis passage through this State; and to have given proofs through him\r\nof my respect for you. But I live far from the great stage road which\r\nforms the communication of our States from north to south, and such\r\na deviation was probably not admitted by his business. The question\r\nproposed in my letter of February 1st, 1804, has since become quite a\r\n\"question viseuse.\" I had then persuaded myself that a nation, distant\r\nas we are from the contentions of Europe, avoiding all offences to other\r\npowers, and not over-hasty in resenting offence from them, doing justice\r\nto all, faithfully fulfilling the duties of neutrality, performing all\r\noffices of amity, and administering to their interests by the benefits\r\nof our commerce, that such a nation, I say, might expect to live in\r\npeace, and consider itself merely as a member of the great family of\r\nmankind; that in such case it might devote itself to whatever it could\r\nbest produce, secure of a peaceable exchange of surplus for what could\r\nbe more advantageously furnished by others, as takes place between one\r\ncounty and another of France. But experience has shown that continued\r\npeace depends not merely on our own justice and prudence, but on that of\r\nothers also; that when forced into war, the interception of exchanges\r\nwhich must be made across a wide ocean, becomes a powerful weapon in\r\nthe hands of an enemy domineering over that element, and to the other\r\ndistresses of war adds the want of all those necessaries for which\r\nwe have permitted ourselves to be dependent on others, even arms and\r\nclothing. This fact, therefore, solves the question by reducing it to its\r\nultimate form, whether profit or preservation is the first interest of a\r\nState? We are consequently become manufacturers to a degree incredible\r\nto those who do not see it, and who only consider the short period of\r\ntime during which we have been driven to them by the suicidal policy\r\nof England. The prohibiting duties we lay on all articles of foreign\r\nmanufacture which prudence requires us to establish at home, with the\r\npatriotic determination of every good citizen to use no foreign article\r\nwhich can be made within ourselves, without regard to difference of\r\nprice, secures us against a relapse into foreign dependency. And this\r\ncircumstance may be worthy of your consideration, should you continue in\r\nthe disposition to emigrate to this country. Your manufactory of cotton,\r\non a moderate scale combined with a farm, might be preferable to either\r\nsingly, and the one or the other might become principal, as experience\r\nshould recommend. Cotton ready spun is in ready demand, and if woven,\r\nstill more so.\r\n\r\nI will proceed now to answer the inquiries which respect your views\r\nof removal; and I am glad that, in looking over our map, your eye has\r\nbeen attracted by the village of Charlottesville, because I am better\r\nacquainted with that than any other portion of the United States, being\r\nwithin three or four miles of the place of my birth and residence. It\r\nis a portion of country which certainly possesses great advantages. Its\r\nsoil is equal in natural fertility to any high lands I have ever seen;\r\nit is red and hilly, very like much of the country of Champagne and\r\nBurgundy, on the route of Sens, Vermanton, Vitteaux, Dijon, and along\r\nthe Cote to Chagny, excellently adapted to wheat, maize, and clover;\r\nlike all mountainous countries it is perfectly healthy, liable to no\r\nagues and fevers, or to any particular epidemic, as is evidenced by the\r\nrobust constitution of its inhabitants, and their numerous families. As\r\nmany instances of nonagenaires exist habitually in this neighborhood\r\nas in the same degree of population anywhere. Its temperature may be\r\nconsidered as a medium of that of the United States. The extreme of cold\r\nin ordinary winters being about 7° of Reaumur below zero (French. =16°),\r\nand in the severest, 12° (French. =5°), while the ordinary mornings are\r\nabove zero. The maximum of heat in summer is about 28° (French. =96°),\r\nof which we have one or two instances in a summer for a few hours. About\r\nten or twelve days in July and August, the thermometer rises for two\r\nor three hours to about 23° (French. =84°), while the ordinary mid-day\r\nheat of those months is about 21° (French. =80°), the mercury continuing\r\nat that two or three hours, and falling in the evening to about 17°\r\n(French. =70°). White frosts commence about the middle of October, tender\r\nvegetables are in danger from them till nearly the middle of April. The\r\nmercury begins, about the middle of November, to be occasionally at the\r\nfreezing point, and ceases to be so about the middle of March. We have\r\nof freezing nights about fifty in the course of the winter, but not\r\nmore than ten days in which the mercury does not rise above the freezing\r\npoint. Fire is desirable even in close apartments whenever the outward\r\nair is below 10, (=55° Fahrenheit,) and that is the case with us through\r\nthe day, one hundred and thirty two days in the year, and on mornings\r\nand evenings sixty-eight days more. So that we have constant fires five\r\nmonths, and a little over two months more on mornings and evenings.\r\nObservations made at Yorktown in the lower country, show that they need\r\nseven days less of constant fires, and thirty-eight less of mornings and\r\nevenings. On an average of seven years I have found our snows amount\r\nin the whole to fifteen inches depth, and to cover the ground fifteen\r\ndays; these, with the rains, give us four feet of water in the year. The\r\ngarden pea, which we are now sowing, comes to table about the 12th of\r\nMay; strawberries and cherries about the same time; asparagus the 1st\r\nof April. The artichoke stands the winter without cover; lettuce and\r\nendive with a slight one of bushes, and often without any; and the fig,\r\nprotected by a little straw, begins to ripen in July; if unprotected,\r\nnot till the 1st of September. There is navigation for boats of six tons\r\nfrom Charlottesville to Richmond, the nearest tide-water, and principal\r\nmarket for our produce. The country is what we call well inhabited, there\r\nbeing in our county, Albemarle, of about seven hundred and fifty square\r\nmiles, about twenty thousand inhabitants, or twenty-seven to a square\r\nmile, of whom, however, one half are people of color, either slaves or\r\nfree. The society is much better than is common in country situations;\r\nperhaps there is not a better _country_ society in the United States.\r\nBut do not imagine this a Parisian or an academical society. It consists\r\nof plain, honest, and rational neighbors, some of them well informed and\r\nmen of reading, all superintending their farms, hospitable and friendly,\r\nand speaking nothing but English. The manners of every nation are the\r\nstandard of orthodoxy within itself. But these standards being arbitrary,\r\nreasonable people in all allow free toleration for the manners, as\r\nfor the religion of others. Our culture is of wheat for market, and of\r\nmaize, oats, peas, and clover, for the support of the farm. We reckon\r\nit a good distribution to divide a farm into three fields, putting one\r\ninto wheat, half a one into maize, the other half into oats or peas,\r\nand the third into clover, and to tend the fields successively in this\r\nrotation. Some woodland in addition, is always necessary to furnish\r\nfuel, fences, and timber for constructions. Our best farmers (such as\r\nMr. Randolph, my son-in-law) get from ten to twenty bushels of wheat to\r\nthe acre; our worst (such as myself) from six to eighteen, with little\r\nor more manuring. The bushel of wheat is worth in common times about\r\none dollar. The common produce of maize is from ten to twenty bushels,\r\nworth half a dollar the bushel, which is of a cubic foot and a quarter,\r\nor, more exactly, of two thousand one hundred and seventy-eight cubic\r\ninches. From these data you may judge best for yourself of the size of\r\nthe farm which would suit your family; bearing in mind, that while you\r\ncan be furnished by the farm itself for consumption, with every article\r\nit is adapted to produce, the sale of your wheat at market is to furnish\r\nthe fund for all other necessary articles. I will add that both soil and\r\nclimate are admirably adapted to the vine, which is the abundant natural\r\nproduction of our forests, and that you cannot bring a more valuable\r\nlaborer than one acquainted with both its culture and manipulation into\r\nwine.\r\n\r\nYour only inquiry now unanswered is, the price of these lands. To answer\r\nthis with precision, would require details too long for a letter; the\r\nfact being, that we have no metallic measure of values at present, while\r\nwe are overwhelmed with bank paper. The depreciation of this swells\r\nnominal prices, without furnishing any stable index of real value. I\r\nwill endeavor briefly to give you an idea of this state of things by an\r\noutline of its history.\r\n\r\n     In 1781 we had 1 bank, its capital $1,000,000\r\n     \"  1791   \"        6                 \"         13,135,000\r\n     \"  1794   \"       17                 \"         18,642,000\r\n     \"  1796   \"       24                 \"         20,472,000\r\n     \"  1803   \"       34                 \"         29,112,000\r\n     \"  1804   \"       66 their amount of capital not known.\r\n\r\nAnd at this time we have probably one hundred banks, with capitals\r\namounting to one hundred millions of dollars, on which they are authorized\r\nby law to issue notes to three times that amount, so that our circulating\r\nmedium may now be estimated at from two to three hundred millions of\r\ndollars, on a population of eight and a half millions. The banks were\r\nable, for awhile, to keep this trash at par with metallic money, or\r\nrather to depreciate the metals to a par with their paper, by keeping\r\ndeposits of cash sufficient to exchange for such of their notes as they\r\nwere called on to pay in cash. But the circumstances of the war draining\r\naway all our specie, all these banks have stopped payment, but with a\r\npromise to resume specie exchanges whenever circumstances shall produce a\r\nreturn of the metals. Some of the most prudent and honest will possibly\r\ndo this; but the mass of them never will nor can. Yet, having no other\r\nmedium, we take their paper, of necessity, for purposes of the instant,\r\nbut never to lay by us. The government is now issuing treasury notes for\r\ncirculation, bottomed on solid funds, and bearing interest. The banking\r\nconfederacy (and the merchants bound to them by their debts) will endeavor\r\nto crush the credit of these notes; but the country is eager for them,\r\nas something they can trust to, and so soon as a convenient quantity\r\nof them can get into circulation, the bank notes die. You may judge\r\nthat, in this state of things, the holders of bank notes will give free\r\nprices for lands, and that were I to tell you simply the present prices\r\nof lands in this medium, it would give you no idea on which you could\r\ncalculate. But I will state to you the progressive prices which have\r\nbeen paid for particular parcels of land for some years back, which may\r\nenable you to distinguish between the real increase of value regularly\r\nproduced by our advancement in population, wealth, and skill, and the\r\nbloated value arising from the present disordered and dropsical state\r\nof our medium. There are two tracts of land adjoining me, and another\r\nnot far off, all of excellent quality, which happen to have been sold\r\nat different epochs as follows:\r\n\r\n     One was sold in 1793 for $4 an acre, in 1812, at $10,\r\n                                     and is now rated $16.\r\n     The 2d    \"     1786  \"   5⅓  \"         1803   \"  10\r\n                                     and is now rated $20.\r\n     The 3d    \"     1797  \"   7      \"      1811   \"  16\r\n                                     and is now rated $20.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, however, I suppose we may estimate that the steady annual\r\nrise of our lands is in a geometrical ratio of 5 per cent.; that were\r\nour medium now in a wholesome state, they might be estimated at from\r\ntwelve to fifteen dollars the acre; and I may add, I believe with\r\ncorrectness, that there is not any part of the Atlantic States where\r\nlands of equal quality and advantages can be had as cheap. When sold\r\nwith a dwelling-house on them, little additional is generally asked for\r\nthe house. These buildings are generally of wooden materials, and of\r\nindifferent structure and accommodation. Most of the hired labor here is\r\nof people of color, either slaves or free. An able-bodied man has sixty\r\ndollars a year, and is clothed and fed by the employer; a woman half that.\r\nWhite laborers may be had, but they are less subordinate, their wages\r\nhigher, and their nourishment much more expensive. A good horse for the\r\nplough costs fifty or sixty dollars. A draught ox twenty to twenty-five\r\ndollars. A milch cow fifteen to eighteen dollars. A sheep two dollars.\r\nBeef is about five cents, mutton and pork seven cents the pound. A turkey\r\nor goose fifty cents apiece, a chicken eight and one-third cents; a\r\ndozen eggs the same. Fresh butter twenty to twenty-five cents the pound.\r\nAnd, to render as full as I can the information which may enable you\r\nto calculate for yourself, I enclose you a Philadelphia price-current,\r\ngiving the prices in regular times of most of the articles of produce\r\nor manufacture, foreign and domestic.\r\n\r\nThat it may be for the benefit of your children and their descendants to\r\nremove to a country where, for enterprise and talents, so many avenues\r\nare open to fortune and fame, I have little doubt. But I should be afraid\r\nto affirm that, at your time of life, and with habits formed on the state\r\nof society in France, a change for one so entirely different would be\r\nfor your personal happiness. Fearful therefore to persuade, I shall add\r\nwith sincere truth, that I shall very highly estimate the addition of\r\nsuch a neighbor to our society, and that there is no service within my\r\npower which I shall not render with pleasure and promptitude. With this\r\nassurance be pleased to accept that of my great esteem and respect.\r\n\r\nP. S. This letter will be handed you by Mr. Ticknor, a young gentleman\r\nof Massachusetts, of great erudition and worth, and who will be gratified\r\nby the occasion of being presented to the author of the Traité d'Economie\r\nPolitique.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO FRANCIS C. GRAY, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                                 MONTICELLO, March 4, 1815.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Despatching to Mr. Ticknor my packet of letters for Paris,\r\nit occurs to me that I committed an error in a matter of information\r\nwhich you asked of me while here. It is indeed of little importance,\r\nyet as well corrected as otherwise, and the rather as it gives me an\r\noccasion of renewing my respects to you. You asked me in conversation,\r\nwhat constituted a mulatto by our law? And I believe I told you four\r\ncrossings with the whites. I looked afterwards into our law, and found\r\nit to be in these words: \"Every person, other than a negro, of whose\r\ngrandfathers or grandmothers any one shall have been a negro, shall be\r\ndeemed a mulatto, and so every such person who shall have one-fourth\r\npart or more of negro blood, shall in like manner be deemed a mulatto\";\r\nL. Virgà 1792, December 17: the case put in the first member of this\r\nparagraph of the law is _exempli gratiâ_. The latter contains the true\r\ncanon, which is that one-fourth of negro blood, mixed with any portion\r\nof white, constitutes the mulatto. As the issue has one-half of the\r\nblood of each parent, and the blood of each of these may be made up\r\nof a variety of fractional mixtures, the estimate of their compound in\r\nsome cases may be intricate, it becomes a mathematical problem of the\r\nsame class with those on the mixtures of different liquors or different\r\nmetals; as in these, therefore, the algebraical notation is the most\r\nconvenient and intelligible. Let us express the pure blood of the white\r\nin the capital letters of the printed alphabet, the pure blood of the\r\nnegro in the small letters of the printed alphabet, and any given mixture\r\nof either, by way of abridgement in MS. letters.\r\n\r\nLet the first crossing be of _a_, pure negro, with A, pure white. The\r\nunit of blood of the issue being composed of the half of that of each\r\nparent, will be _a_/2 + A/2. Call it, for abbreviation, _h_ (half blood.)\r\n\r\nLet the second crossing be of _h_ and B, the blood of the issue will be\r\n_h_/2 + B/2, or substituting for _h_/2 its equivalent, it will be _a_/4\r\n+ A/4 + B/2 call it _q_ (quarteroon) being 1/4 negro blood.\r\n\r\nLet the third crossing be of _q_ and C, their offspring will be _q_/2 +\r\nC/2 = _a_/8 + A/8 + B/4 + C/2, call this _e_ (eighth), who having less\r\nthan 1/4 of _a_, or of pure negro blood, to wit 1/8 only, is no longer a\r\nmulatto, so that a third cross clears the blood.\r\n\r\nFrom these elements let us examine their compounds. For example, let\r\n_h_ and _q_ cohabit, their issue will be _h_/2 + _q_/2 = _a_/4 + A/4 +\r\n_a_/8 + A/8 + B/4 = 3_a_/8 + 3A/8 + B/4 wherein we find 3/8 of _a_, or\r\nnegro blood.\r\n\r\nLet _h_ and _e_ cohabit, their issue will be _h_/2 + _e_/2 = _a_/4 +\r\nA/4 + _a_/16 + A/16 + B/8 + _c_/4 = 5_a_/16 + 5A/16 + B/8 + _c_/4,\r\nwherein 5/16 _a_ makes still a mulatto.\r\n\r\nLet _q_ and _e_ cohabit, the half of the blood of each will be _q_/2 +\r\n_e_/2 = _a_/8 + A/8 + B/4 + _a_/16 + A/16 + B/8 + C/4 = 3_a_/16 + 3A/16\r\n+ 3B/8 + C/4, wherein 3/16 of _a_ is no longer a mulatto, and thus may\r\nevery compound be noted and summed, the sum of the fractions composing\r\nthe blood of the issue being always equal to unit. It is understood in\r\nnatural history that a fourth cross of one race of animals with another\r\ngives an issue equivalent for all sensible purposes to the original\r\nblood. Thus a Merino ram being crossed, first with a country ewe, second\r\nwith his daughter, third with his granddaughter, and fourth with the\r\ngreat-granddaughter, the last issue is deemed pure Merino, having in\r\nfact but 1/16 of the country blood. Our canon considers two crosses with\r\nthe pure white, and a third with any degree of mixture, however small,\r\nas clearing the issue of the negro blood. But observe, that this does\r\nnot re-establish freedom, which depends on the condition of the mother,\r\nthe principle of the civil law, _partus sequitur ventrem_, being adopted\r\nhere. But if _e_ be emancipated, he becomes a free _white_ man, and a\r\ncitizen of the United States to all intents and purposes. So much for\r\nthis trifle by way of correction.\r\n\r\nI sincerely congratulate you on the peace, and more especially on the\r\nclose of our war with so much eclat. Our second and third campaigns\r\nhere, I trust, more than redeemed the disgraces of the first, and proved\r\nthat although a republican government is slow to move, yet, when once\r\nin motion, its momentum becomes irresistible; and I am persuaded it\r\nwould have been found so in the last war, had it continued. Experience\r\nhad just begun to elicit those among our officers who had talents for\r\nwar, and under the guidance of these one campaign would have planted\r\nour standard on the walls of Quebec, and another on those of Halifax.\r\nBut peace is better for us all; and if it could be followed by a cordial\r\nconciliation between us and England, it would ensure the happiness and\r\nprosperity of both. The bag of wind, however, on which they are now\r\nriding, must be suffered to blow out before they will be able soberly to\r\nsettle on their true bottom. If they adopt a course of friendship with\r\nus, the commerce of one hundred millions of people, which some now born\r\nwill live to see here, will maintain them forever as a great unit of\r\nthe European family. But if they go on checking, irritating, injuring\r\nand hostilizing us, they will force on us the motto \"_Carthago delenda\r\nest_.\" And some Scipio Americanus will leave to posterity the problem of\r\nconjecturing where stood once the ancient and splendid city of London!\r\nNothing more simple or certain than the elements of this circulation. I\r\nhope the good sense of both parties will concur in travelling rather the\r\npaths of peace, of affection, and reciprocations of interest. I salute\r\nyou with sincere and friendly esteem, and if the homage offered to the\r\nvirtues of your father can be acceptable to him, place mine at his feet.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GIRARDIN.\r\n\r\n                                                MONTICELLO, March 12, 1815.\r\n\r\nI return the three Cativers, which I have perused with the usual\r\nsatisfaction. You will find a few pencilled notes merely verbal.\r\n\r\nBut in one place I have taken a greater liberty than I ever took before,\r\nor ever indeed had occasion to take. It is in the case of Josiah Philips,\r\nwhich I find strangely represented by Judge Tucker and Mr. Edmund\r\nRandolph, and very negligently vindicated by Mr. Henry. That case is\r\npersonally known to me, because I was of the legislature at the time,\r\nwas one of those consulted by Mr. Henry, and had my share in the passage\r\nof the bill. I never before saw the observations of those gentlemen,\r\nwhich you quote on this case, and will now therefore briefly make some\r\nstrictures on them.\r\n\r\nJudge Tucker, instead of a definition of the functions of bills of\r\nattainder, has given a diatribe against their abuse. The occasion and\r\nproper office of a bill of attainder is this: When a person charged with\r\na crime withdraws from justice, or resists it by force, either in his\r\nown or a foreign country, no other means of bringing him to trial or\r\npunishment being practicable, a special act is passed by the legislature\r\nadapted to the particular case. This prescribes to him a sufficient time\r\nto appear and submit to a trial by his peers; declares that his refusal\r\nto appear shall be taken as a confession of guilt, as in the ordinary\r\ncase of an offender at the bar refusing to plead, and pronounces the\r\nsentence which would have been rendered on his confession or conviction\r\nin a court of law. No doubt that these acts of attainder have been abused\r\nin England as instruments of vengeance by a successful over a defeated\r\nparty. But what institution is insusceptible of abuse in wicked hands?\r\n\r\nAgain, the judge says \"the court refused to pass sentence of execution\r\npursuant to the directions of the act.\" The court could not refuse\r\nthis, because it was never proposed to them; and my authority for this\r\nassertion shall be presently given.\r\n\r\nFor the perversion of a fact so intimately known to himself, Mr.\r\nRandolph can be excused only by our indulgence for orators who, pressed\r\nby a powerful adversary, lose sight, in the ardor of conflict of the\r\nrigorous accuracies of fact, and permit their imagination to distort\r\nand color them to the views of the moment. He was Attorney General at\r\nthe time, and told me himself, the first time I saw him after the trial\r\nof Philips, that when taken and delivered up to justice, he had thought\r\nit best to make no use of the act of attainder, and to take no measure\r\nunder it; that he had indicted him at the common law either for murder\r\nor robbery (I forgot which and whether for both); that he was tried on\r\nthis indictment in the ordinary way, found guilty by the jury, sentenced\r\nand executed under the common law; a course which every one approves,\r\nbecause the first object of the act of attainder was to bring him to\r\nfair trial. Whether Mr. Randolph was right in this information to me, or\r\nwhen in the debate with Mr. Henry, he represents this atrocious offender\r\nas sentenced and executed under the act of attainder, let the record of\r\nthe case decide.\r\n\r\n\"Without being confronted with his accusers and witnesses, without the\r\nprivilege of calling for evidence in his behalf, he was sentenced to\r\ndeath, and afterwards actually executed.\" I appeal to the universe to\r\nproduce one single instance from the first establishment of government\r\nin this State to the present day, where, in a trial at bar, a criminal\r\nhas been refused confrontation with his accusers and witnesses, or denied\r\nthe privilege of calling for evidence in his behalf; had it been done in\r\nthis case, I would have asked of the Attorney General why he proposed or\r\npermitted it. But without having seen the record, I will venture on the\r\ncharacter of our courts, to deny that it was done. But if Mr. Randolph\r\nmeant only that Philips had not these advantages on the passage of the\r\nbill of attainder, how idle to charge the legislature with omitting to\r\nconfront the culprit with his witnesses, when he was standing out in arms\r\nand in defiance of their authority, and their sentence was to take effect\r\nonly on his own refusal to come in and be confronted. We must either\r\ntherefore consider this as a mere hyperbolism of imagination in the heat\r\nof debate, or what I should rather, believe a defective statement by\r\nthe reporter of Mr. Randolph's argument. I suspect this last the rather\r\nbecause this point in the charge of Mr. Randolph is equally omitted in\r\nthe defence of Mr. Henry. This gentleman must have known that Philips\r\nwas tried and executed under the common law, and yet, according to his\r\nreport, he rests his defence on a justification of the attainder only.\r\nBut all who knew Mr. Henry, know that when at ease in argument, he was\r\nsometimes careless, not giving himself the trouble of ransacking either\r\nhis memory or imagination for all the topics of his subject, or his\r\naudience that of hearing them. No man on earth knew better when he had\r\nsaid enough for his hearers.\r\n\r\nMr. Randolph charges us with having read the bill three times in the\r\nsame day. I do not remember the fact, nor whether this was enforced on\r\nus by the urgency of the ravages of Philips, or of the time at which\r\nthe bill was introduced. I have some idea it was at or near the close\r\nof the session; the journals, which I have not, will ascertain the fact.\r\n\r\nAfter the particular strictures I will proceed to propose, 1st, that the\r\nword \"substantially,\" page 92, l. 8., be changed for \"which has been\r\ncharged with,\" [subjoining a note of reference. 1 Tucker's Blackst.\r\nAppend., 292. Debates of Virginia Convention.]\r\n\r\n2. That the whole of the quotations from Tucker, Randolph and Henry, be\r\nstruck out, and instead of the text beginning page 92 l. 12, with the\r\nwords \"bills of attainder, &.,\" to the words \"so often merited,\" page\r\n95 l. 4, be inserted the following, to-wit:\r\n\r\n\"This was passed on the following occasion. A certain Josiah Philips,\r\nlaborer of the parish of Lynhaven, in the county of Princess Anne, a man\r\nof daring and ferocious disposition, associating with other individuals\r\nof a similar cast, spread terror and desolation through the lower country,\r\ncommitting murders, burning houses, wasting farms, and perpetrating other\r\nenormities, at the bare mention of which humanity shudders. Every effort\r\nto apprehend him proved abortive. Strong in the number of his ruffian\r\nassociates, or where force would have failed resorting to stratagem\r\nand ambush, striking the deadly blow or applying the fatal torch at\r\nthe midnight hour, and in those places which their insulated situation\r\nleft almost unprotected, he retired with impunity to his secret haunts,\r\nreeking with blood, and loaded with plunder. [So far the text of Mr.\r\nGirardin is preserved.] The inhabitants of the counties which were the\r\ntheatre of his crimes, never secure a moment by day or by night, in\r\ntheir fields or their beds, sent representations of their distresses\r\nto the governor, claiming the public protection. He consulted with some\r\nmembers of the legislature then sitting, on the best method of proceeding\r\nagainst the atrocious offender. Too powerful to be arrested by the sheriff\r\nand his _posse comitatus_, it was not doubted but an armed force might\r\nbe sent to hunt and destroy him and his accomplices in their morasses\r\nand fastnesses wherever found. But the proceeding concluded to be most\r\nconsonant with the forms and principles of our government, was that the\r\nlegislature should pass an act giving him a reasonable but limited day\r\nto surrender himself to justice, and to submit to a trial by his peers.\r\nAccording to the laws of the land, to consider a refusal as a confession\r\nof guilt, and divesting him as an outlaw of the character of citizen, to\r\npass on him the sentence prescribed by the law; and the public officer\r\nbeing defied, to make every one his deputy, and especially those whose\r\nsafety hourly depended on his destruction. The case was laid before the\r\nlegislature, the proofs were ample, his outrages as notorious as those\r\nof the public enemy, and well known to the members of both houses from\r\nthose counties. No one pretended then that the perpetrator of crimes who\r\ncould successfully resist the officers of justice, should be protected\r\nin the continuance of them by the privileges of his citizenship, and\r\nthat baffling ordinary process, nothing extraordinary could be rightfully\r\nadopted to protect the citizens against him. No one doubted that society\r\nhad a right to erase from the roll of its members any one who rendered\r\nhis own existence inconsistent with theirs; to withdraw from him the\r\nprotection of their laws, and to remove him from among them by exile,\r\nor even by death if necessary. An enemy in lawful war, putting to death\r\nin cold blood the prisoner he has taken, authorizes retaliation, which\r\nwould be inflicted with peculiar justice on the individual guilty of the\r\ndeed, were it to happen that he should be taken. And could the murders\r\nand robberies of a pirate or outlaw entitle him to more tenderness? They\r\npassed the law, therefore, and without opposition. He did not come in\r\nbefore the day prescribed; continued his lawless outrages; was afterwards\r\ntaken in arms, but delivered over to the ordinary justice of the county.\r\nThe Attorney General for the commonwealth, the immediate agent of the\r\ngovernment, waiving all appeal to the act of attainder, indicted him\r\nat the common law as a murderer and robber. He was arraigned on that\r\nindictment in the usual forms, before a jury of his vicinage, and no use\r\nwhatever made of the act of attainder in any part of the proceedings.\r\nHe pleaded that he was a British subject, authorized to bear arms by a\r\ncommission from Lord Dunmore; that he was therefore a mere prisoner of\r\nwar, and under the protection of the law of nations. The court being of\r\nopinion that a commission from an enemy could not protect a citizen in\r\ndeeds of murder and robbery, overruled his plea; he was found guilty by\r\nhis jury, sentenced by the court, and executed by the ordinary officer\r\nof justice, and all according to the forms and rules of the common law.\"\r\n\r\nI recommend an examination of the records for ascertaining the facts of\r\nthis case, for although my memory assures me of the leading ones, I am\r\nnot so certain in my recollection of the details. I am not sure of the\r\ncharacter of the particular crimes committed by Philips, or charged in\r\nhis indictment, whether his plea of alien enemy was formally put in and\r\noverruled, what were the specific provisions of the act of attainder,\r\nthe urgency which caused it to be read three times in one day, if the\r\nfact were, &c., &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. WENDOVER.[13]\r\n\r\n                                                MONTICELLO, March 13, 1815.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your favor of January the 30th was received after long delay on\r\nthe road, and I have to thank you for the volume of discourses which\r\nyou have been so kind as to send me. I have gone over them with great\r\nsatisfaction, and concur with the able preacher in his estimate of the\r\ncharacter of the belligerents in our late war, and lawfulness of defensive\r\nwar. I consider the war, with him, as \"made on good advice,\" that is,\r\nfor just causes, and its dispensation as providential, inasmuch as it\r\nhas exercised our patriotism and submission to order, has planted and\r\ninvigorated among us arts of urgent necessity, has manifested the strong\r\nand the weak parts of our republican institutions, and the excellence of a\r\nrepresentative democracy compared with the misrule of kings, has rallied\r\nthe opinions of mankind to the natural rights of expatriation, and of a\r\ncommon property in the ocean, and raised us to that grade in the scale\r\nof nations which the bravery and liberality of our citizen soldiers, by\r\nland and by sea, the wisdom of our institutions and their observance of\r\njustice, entitled us to in the eyes of the world. All this Mr. McLeod\r\nhas well proved, and from those sources of argument particularly which\r\nbelong to his profession. On one question only I differ from him, and it\r\nis that which constitutes the subject of his first discourse, the right\r\nof discussing public affairs _in the pulpit_. I add the last words,\r\nbecause I admit the right in _general conversation_ and in _writing_;\r\nin which last form it has been exercised in the valuable book you have\r\nnow favored me with.\r\n\r\nThe mass of human concerns, moral and physical, is so vast, the field of\r\nknowledge requisite for man to conduct them to the best advantage is so\r\nextensive, that no human being can acquire the whole himself, and much\r\nless in that degree necessary for the instruction of others. It has of\r\nnecessity, then, been distributed into different departments, each of\r\nwhich, singly, may give occupation enough to the whole time and attention\r\nof a single individual. Thus we have teachers of Languages, teachers of\r\nMathematics, of Natural Philosophy, of Chemistry, of Medicine, of Law,\r\nof History, of Government, &c. Religion, too, is a separate department,\r\nand happens to be the only one deemed requisite for all men, however\r\nhigh or low. Collections of men associate together, under the name of\r\ncongregations, and employ a religious teacher of the particular sect of\r\nopinions of which they happen to be, and contribute to make up a stipend\r\nas a compensation for the trouble of delivering them, at such periods\r\nas they agree on, lessons in the religion they profess. If they want\r\ninstruction in other sciences or arts, they apply to other instructors;\r\nand this is generally the business of early life. But I suppose there\r\nis not an instance of a single congregation which has employed their\r\npreacher for the mixed purposes of lecturing them _from the pulpit_\r\nin Chemistry, in Medicine, in Law, in the science and principles of\r\nGovernment, or in anything but Religion exclusively. Whenever, therefore,\r\npreachers, instead of a lesson in religion, put them off with a discourse\r\non the Copernican system, on chemical affinities, on the construction\r\nof government, or the characters or conduct of those administering it,\r\nit is a breach of contract, depriving their audience of the kind of\r\nservice for which they are salaried, and giving them, instead of it, what\r\nthey did not want, or, if wanted, would rather seek from better sources\r\nin that particular art or science. In choosing our pastor we look to\r\nhis religious qualifications, without inquiring into his physical or\r\npolitical dogmas, with which we mean to have nothing to do. I am aware\r\nthat arguments may be found, which may twist a thread of politics into\r\nthe cord of religious duties. So may they for every other branch of human\r\nart or science. Thus, for example, it is a religious duty to obey the\r\nlaws of our country; the teacher of religion, therefore, must instruct\r\nus in those laws, that we may know how to obey them. It is a religious\r\nduty to assist our sick neighbors; the preacher must, therefore, teach\r\nus medicine, that we may do it understandingly. It is a religious duty\r\nto preserve our own health; our religious teacher, then, must tell us\r\nwhat dishes are wholesome, and give us recipes in cookery, that we may\r\nlearn how to prepare them. And so, ingenuity, by generalizing more and\r\nmore, may amalgamate all the branches of science into any one of them,\r\nand the physician who is paid to visit the sick, may give a sermon\r\ninstead of medicine, and the merchant to whom money is sent for a hat,\r\nmay send a handkerchief instead of it. But notwithstanding this possible\r\nconfusion of all sciences into one, common sense draws lines between\r\nthem sufficiently distinct for the general purposes of life, and no one\r\nis at a loss to understand that a recipe in medicine or cookery, or a\r\ndemonstration in geometry, is not a lesson in religion. I do not deny\r\nthat a congregation may, if they please, agree with their preacher that\r\nhe shall instruct them in Medicine also, or Law, or Politics. Then,\r\nlectures in these, from the pulpit, become not only a matter of right,\r\nbut of duty also. But this must be with the consent of every individual;\r\nbecause the association being voluntary, the mere majority has no right\r\nto apply the contributions of the minority to purposes unspecified in the\r\nagreement of the congregation. I agree, too, that on all other occasions,\r\nthe preacher has the right, equally with every other citizen, to express\r\nhis sentiments, in speaking or writing; on the subjects of Medicine,\r\nLaw, Politics, &c., his leisure time being his own, and his congregation\r\nnot obliged to listen to his conversation or to read his writings; and\r\nno one would have regretted more than myself, had any scruple as to\r\nthis right withheld from us the valuable discourses which have led to\r\nthe expression of an opinion as to the true limits of the right. I feel\r\nmy portion of indebtment to the reverend author for the distinguished\r\nlearning, the logic and the eloquence with which he has proved that\r\nreligion, as well as reason, confirms the soundness of those principles\r\non which our government has been founded and its rights asserted.\r\n\r\nThese are my views on this question. They are in opposition to those\r\nof the highly respected and able preacher, and are, therefore, the more\r\ndoubtingly offered. Difference of opinion leads to inquiry, and inquiry\r\nto truth; and that, I am sure, is the ultimate and sincere object of us\r\nboth. We both value too much the freedom of opinion sanctioned by our\r\nconstitution, not to cherish its exercise even where in opposition to\r\nourselves.\r\n\r\nUnaccustomed to reserve or mystery in the expression of my opinions, I\r\nhave opened myself frankly on a question suggested by your letter and\r\npresent. And although I have not the honor of your acquaintance, this\r\nmark of attention, and still more the sentiments of esteem so kindly\r\nexpressed in your letter, are entitled to a confidence that observations\r\nnot intended for the public will not be ushered to their notice, as has\r\nhappened to me sometimes. Tranquillity, at my age, is the balm of life.\r\nWhile I know I am safe in the honor and charity of a McLeod, I do not\r\nwish to be cast forth to the Marats, the Dantons, and the Robespierres\r\nof the priesthood; I mean the Parishes, the Ogdens, and the Gardiners\r\nof Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nI pray you to accept the assurances of my esteem and respect.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n  [13] [This is endorsed \"not sent.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CÆSAR A. RODNEY.\r\n\r\n                                                MONTICELLO, March 16, 1815.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR FRIEND AND ANCIENT COLLEAGUE,--Your letter of February the 19th\r\nhas been received with very sincere pleasure. It recalls to memory the\r\nsociability, the friendship, and the harmony of action which united\r\npersonal happiness with public duties, during the portion of our lives in\r\nwhich we acted together. Indeed, the affectionate harmony of our cabinet\r\nis among the sweetest of my recollections. I have just received a letter\r\nof friendship from General Dearborne. He writes me that he is now retiring\r\nfrom every species of public occupation, to pass the remainder of life\r\nas a private citizen; and he promises me a visit in the course of the\r\nsummer. As you hold out a hope of the same gratification, if chance or\r\npurpose could time your visits together, it would make a real jubilee.\r\nBut come as you will or as you can, it will always be joy enough to\r\nme. Only you must give me a month's notice; because I go three or four\r\ntimes a year to a possession ninety miles southwestward, and am absent\r\na month at a time, and the mortification would be indelible of losing\r\nsuch a visit by a mistimed absence. You will find me in habitual good\r\nhealth, great contentedness, enfeebled in body, impaired in memory, but\r\nwithout decay in my friendships.\r\n\r\nGreat, indeed, have been the revolutions in the world, since you and I\r\nhave had anything to do with it. To me they have been like the howlings\r\nof the winter storm over the battlements, while warm in my bed. The\r\nunprincipled tyrant of the land is fallen, his power reduced to its\r\noriginal nothingness, his person only not yet in the mad-house, where\r\nit ought always to have been. His equally unprincipled competitor, the\r\ntyrant of the ocean, in the mad-house indeed, in person, but his power\r\nstill stalking over the deep. \"_Quem deus vult perdere, prius dementat._\"\r\nThe madness is acknowledged; the perdition of course impending. Are we\r\nto be the instruments? A friendly, a just, and a reasonable conduct\r\non their part, might make us the main pillar of their prosperity and\r\nexistence. But their deep-rooted hatred to us seems to be the means\r\nwhich Providence permits to lead them to their final catastrophe.\r\n\"_Nullam enim in terris gentem esse, nullum infestiorem populum, nomini\r\nRomano_,\" said the General who erased Capua from the list of powers.\r\nWhat nourishment and support would not England receive from an hundred\r\nmillions of industrious descendants, whom some of her people now born\r\nwill live to see here? What their energies are, she has lately tried.\r\nAnd what has she not to fear from an hundred millions of such men, if\r\nshe continues her maniac course of hatred and hostility to them. I hope\r\nin God she will change. There is not a nation on the globe with whom I\r\nhave more earnestly wished a friendly intercourse on equal conditions.\r\nOn no other would I hold out the hand of friendship to any. I know that\r\ntheir creatures represent me as personally an enemy to England. But fools\r\nonly can believe this, or those who think me a fool. I am an enemy to\r\nher insults and injuries. I am an enemy to the flagitious principles of\r\nher administration, and to those which govern her conduct towards other\r\nnations. But would she give to morality some place in her political\r\ncode, and especially would she exercise decency, and at least neutral\r\npassions towards us, there is not, I repeat it, a people on earth with\r\nwhom I would sacrifice so much to be in friendship. They can do us, as\r\nenemies, more harm than any other nation; and in peace and in war, they\r\nhave more means of disturbing us internally. Their merchants established\r\namong us, the bonds by which our own are chained to their feet, and the\r\nbanking combinations interwoven with the whole, have shown the extent\r\nof their control, even during a war with her. They are the workers of\r\nall the embarrassments our finances have experienced during the war.\r\nDeclaring themselves bankrupt, they have been able still to chain the\r\ngovernment to a dependence on them, and had the war continued, they would\r\nhave reduced us to the inability to command a single dollar. They dared\r\nto proclaim that they would not pay their own paper obligations, yet our\r\ngovernment could not venture to avail themselves of this opportunity\r\nof sweeping their paper from the circulation, and substituting their\r\nown notes bottomed on specific taxes for redemption, which every one\r\nwould have eagerly taken and trusted, rather than the baseless trash of\r\nbankrupt companies; our government, I say, have still been overawed from\r\na contest with them, and has even countenanced and strengthened their\r\ninfluence, by proposing new establishments, with authority to swindle\r\nyet greater sums from our citizens. This is the British influence to\r\nwhich I am an enemy, and which we must subject to our government, or it\r\nwill subject us to that of Britain.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCome, and gratify, by seeing you once more, a friend who assures you\r\nwith sincerity of his constant and affectionate attachment and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL DEARBORNE.\r\n\r\n                                                MONTICELLO, March 17, 1815.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR GENERAL, FRIEND, AND ANCIENT COLLEAGUE,--I have received your\r\nfavor of February the 27th, with very great pleasure, and sincerely\r\nreciprocate congratulations on late events. Peace was indeed desirable;\r\nyet it would not have been as welcome without the successes of New\r\nOrleans. These last have established truths too important not to be\r\nvalued; that the people of Louisiana are sincerely attached to the\r\nUnion; that their city can be defended; that the western States make its\r\ndefence their peculiar concern; that the militia are brave; that their\r\ndeadly aim countervails the manœuvering skill of their enemy; that we\r\nhave officers of natural genius now starting forward from the mass; and\r\nthat, putting together all our conflicts, we can beat the British by\r\nsea and by land, with equal numbers. All this being now proved, I am\r\nglad of the pacification of Ghent, and shall still be more so, if, by\r\na reasonable arrangement against impressment, they will make it truly\r\na treaty of peace, and not a mere truce, as we must all consider it,\r\nuntil the principle of the war is settled. Nor, among the incidents of\r\nthe war, will we forget your services. After the disasters produced by\r\nthe treason or the cowardice, or both, of Hull, and the follies of some\r\nothers, your capture of York and Fort George, first turned the tide of\r\nsuccess in our favor; and the subsequent campaigns sufficiently wiped\r\naway the disgrace of the first. If it were justifiable to look to your\r\nown happiness only, your resolution to retire from all public business\r\ncould not but be approved. But you are too young to ask a discharge as\r\nyet, and the public counsels too much needing the wisdom of our ablest\r\ncitizens, to relinquish their claim on you. And surely none needs your\r\naid more than your own State. Oh, Massachusetts! how have I lamented\r\nthe degradation of your apostasy! Massachusetts, with whom I went\r\nwith pride in 1776, whose vote was my vote on every public question,\r\nand whose principles were then the standard of whatever was free or\r\nfearless. But she was then under the counsels of the two Adamses; while\r\nStrong, her present leader, was promoting petitions for submission to\r\nBritish power and British usurpation. While under her present counsels,\r\nshe must be contented to be nothing; as having a vote, indeed, to be\r\ncounted, but not respected. But should the State once more buckle on\r\nher republican harness, we shall receive her again as a sister, and\r\nrecollect her wanderings among the crimes only of the parricide party,\r\nwhich would have basely sold what their fathers so bravely won from the\r\nsame enemy. Let us look forward, then, to the act of repentance, which,\r\nby dismissing her venal traitors, shall be the signal of return to the\r\nbosom and to the principles of her brethren; and if her late humiliation\r\ncan just give her modesty enough to suppose that her southern brethren\r\nare somewhat on a par with her in wisdom, in information, in patriotism,\r\nin bravery, and even in honesty, although not in psalm singing, she\r\nwill more justly estimate her own relative momentum in the Union. With\r\nher ancient principles, she would really be great, if she did not think\r\nherself the whole. I should be pleased to hear that you go into her\r\ncounsels, and assist in bringing her back to those principles, and to\r\na sober satisfaction with her proportionable share in the direction of\r\nour affairs.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBe so good as to lay my homage at the feet of Mrs. Dearborne and be\r\nassured that I am ever and affectionately yours.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n                                                MONTICELLO, March 23, 1815.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I duly received your favor of the 12th, and with it the\r\npamphlet on the causes and conduct of the war, which I now return. I\r\nhave read it with great pleasure, but with irresistible desire that\r\nit should be published. The reasons in favor of this are strong, and\r\nthose against it are so easily gotten over, that there appears to me\r\nno balance between them. 1. We need it in Europe. They have totally\r\nmistaken our character. Accustomed to rise at a feather themselves,\r\nand to be always fighting, they will see in our conduct, fairly stated,\r\nthat acquiescence under wrong, to a certain degree, is wisdom, and not\r\npusillanimity; and that peace and happiness are preferable to that false\r\nhonor which, by eternal wars, keeps their people in eternal labor, want,\r\nand wretchedness. 2. It is necessary for the people of England, who\r\nhave been deceived as to the causes and conduct of the war, and do not\r\nentertain a doubt, that it was entirely wanton and wicked on our part,\r\nand under the order of Bonaparte. By rectifying their ideas, it will\r\ntend to that conciliation which is absolutely necessary to the peace and\r\nprosperity of both nations. 3. It is necessary for our own people, who,\r\nalthough they have known the details as they went along, yet have been\r\nso plied with false facts and false views by the federalists, that some\r\nimpression has been left that all has not been right. It may be said\r\nthat it will be thought unfriendly. But truths necessary for our own\r\ncharacter, must not be suppressed out of tenderness to its calumniators.\r\nAlthough written, generally, with great moderation, there may be some\r\nthings in the pamphlet which may perhaps irritate. The characterizing\r\nevery act, for example, by its appropriate epithet, is not necessary to\r\nshow its deformity to an intelligent reader. The naked narrative will\r\npresent it truly to his mind, and the more strongly, from its moderation,\r\nas he will perceive that no exaggeration is aimed at. Rubbing down these\r\nroughnesses, and they are neither many nor prominent, and preserving\r\nthe original date, might, I think, remove all the offensiveness, and\r\ngive more effect to the publication. Indeed, I think that a soothing\r\npostscript, addressed to the interests, the prospects, and the sober\r\nreason of both nations, would make it acceptable to both. The trifling\r\nexpense of reprinting it ought not to be considered a moment. Mr. Gallatin\r\ncould have it translated into French, and suffer it to get abroad in\r\nEurope without either avowal or disavowal. But it would be useful to\r\nprint some copies of an appendix, containing all the documents referred\r\nto, to be preserved in libraries, and to facilitate to the present and\r\nfuture writers of history, the acquisition of the materials which test\r\nthe truth it contains.\r\n\r\nI sincerely congratulate you on the peace, and, more especially on the\r\neclat with which the war was closed. The affair of New Orleans was fraught\r\nwith useful lessons to ourselves, our enemies, and our friends, and will\r\npowerfully influence our future relations with the nations of Europe. It\r\nwill show them we mean to take no part in their wars, and count no odds\r\nwhen engaged in our own. I presume that, having spared to the pride of\r\nEngland her formal acknowledgment of the atrocity of impressment in an\r\narticle of the treaty, she will concur in a convention for relinquishing\r\nit. Without this, she must understand that the present is but a truce,\r\ndeterminable on the first act of impressment of an American citizen,\r\ncommitted by any officer of hers. Would it not be better that this\r\nconvention should be a separate act, unconnected with any treaty of\r\ncommerce, and made an indispensable preliminary to all other treaty? If\r\nblended with a treaty of commerce, she will make it the price of injurious\r\nconcessions. Indeed, we are infinitely better without such treaties with\r\nany nation. We cannot too distinctly detach ourselves from the European\r\nsystem, which is essentially belligerent, nor too sedulously cultivate\r\nan American system, essentially pacific. But if we go into commercial\r\ntreaties at all, they should be with all, at the same time, with whom we\r\nhave important commercial relations. France, Spain, Portugal, Holland,\r\nDenmark, Sweden, Russia, all should proceed _pari passu_. Our ministers\r\nmarching in phalanx on the same line, and intercommunicating freely,\r\neach will be supported by the weight of the whole mass, and the facility\r\nwith which the other nations will agree to equal terms of intercourse,\r\nwill discountenance the selfish higglings of England, or justify our\r\nrejection of them. Perhaps, with all of them, it would be best to have\r\nbut the single article _gentis amicissimæ_, leaving everything else to\r\nthe usages and courtesies of civilized nations. But all these things\r\nwill occur to yourself, with their counter-consideration.\r\n\r\nMr. Smith wrote to me on the transportation of the library, and,\r\nparticularly, that it is submitted to your direction. He mentioned, also,\r\nthat Dougherty would be engaged to superintend it. No one will more\r\ncarefully and faithfully execute all those duties which would belong\r\nto a wagon master. But it requires a character acquainted with books,\r\nto receive the library. I am now employing as many hours of every day\r\nas my strength will permit, in arranging the books, and putting every\r\none in its place on the shelves, corresponding with its order on the\r\ncatalogue, and shall have them numbered correspondently. This operation\r\nwill employ me a considerable time yet. Then I should wish a competent\r\nagent to attend, and, with the catalogue in his hand, see that every\r\nbook is on the shelves, and have their lids nailed on, one by one, as\r\nhe proceeds. This would take such a person about two days; after which,\r\nDougherty's business would be the mere mechanical removal, at convenience.\r\nI enclose you a letter from Mr. Milligan, offering his service, which\r\nwould not cost more than eight or ten days' reasonable compensation.\r\nThis is necessary for my safety and your satisfaction, as a just caution\r\nfor the public. You know that there are persons, both in and out of the\r\npublic councils, who will seize every occasion of imputation on either of\r\nus, the more difficult to be repelled in this case, in which a negative\r\ncould not be proved. If you approve of it, therefore, as soon as I am\r\nthrough the review, I will give notice to Mr. Milligan, or any other\r\nperson you will name, to come on immediately. Indeed it would be well\r\nworth while to add to his duty, that of covering the books with a little\r\npaper, (the good bindings, at least,) and filling the vacancies of the\r\npresses with paper parings, to be brought from Washington. This would\r\nadd little more to the time, as he could carry on both operations at once.\r\n\r\nAccept the assurance of my constant and affectionate friendship and\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GIRARDIN.\r\n\r\n                                                MONTICELLO, March 27, 1815.\r\n\r\nI return your 14th chapter with only two or three unimportant alterations\r\nas usual, and with a note suggested, of doubtful admissibility. I believe\r\nit would be acceptable to the reader of every nation except England, and\r\nI do not suppose that, even without it, your book will be a popular one\r\nthere, however you will decide for yourself.\r\n\r\nAs to what is to be said of myself, I of course am not the judge. But\r\nmy sincere wish is that the faithful historian, like the able surgeon,\r\nwould consider me in his hands, while living, as a dead subject, that\r\nthe same judgment may now be expressed which will be rendered hereafter,\r\nso far as my small agency in human affairs may attract future notice;\r\nand I would of choice now stand as at the bar of posterity, \"_Cum semel\r\noccidaris, et de te ultima Minos Fecerit arbitria_.\" The only exact\r\ntestimony of a man is his actions, leaving the reader to pronounce on\r\nthem his own judgment. In anticipating this, too little is safer than\r\ntoo much; and I sincerely assure you that you will please me most by a\r\nrigorous suppression of all friendly partialities. This candid expression\r\nof sentiments once delivered, passive silence becomes the future duty.\r\n\r\nIt is with real regret I inform you that the day of delivering the library\r\nis close at hand. A letter by last mail informs me that Mr. Millegan is\r\nordered to come on the instant I am ready to deliver. I shall complete\r\nthe arrangement of the books on Saturday. There will then remain only to\r\npaste on them their numbers, which will be begun on Sunday. Of this Mr.\r\nMillegan has notice, and may be expected every hour after Monday next.\r\nHe will examine the books by the catalogue, and nail up the presses,\r\none by one, as he gets through them. But it is indispensable for me to\r\nhave all the books in their places when we begin to number them, and it\r\nwould be a great convenience to have all you can do without now, to put\r\nthem into the places they should occupy. Ancient history is numbered.\r\nModern history comes next. The bearer carries a basket to receive what\r\nhe can bring of those you are done with. I salute you with friendship\r\nand respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. BARROW.\r\n\r\n                                                   MONTICELLO, May 1, 1815.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have duly received your favor of March 20th, and am truly\r\nthankful for the favorable sentiments expressed in it towards myself.\r\nIf, in the course of my life, it has been in any degree useful to the\r\ncause of humanity, the fact itself bears its full reward. The particular\r\nsubject of the pamphlet you enclosed me was one of early and tender\r\nconsideration with me, and had I continued in the councils of my own\r\nState, it should never have been out of sight. The only practicable\r\nplan I could ever devise is stated under the 14th quære of the Notes on\r\nVirginia, and it is still the one most sound in my judgment. Unhappily it\r\nis a case for which both parties require long and difficult preparation.\r\nThe mind of the master is to be apprized by reflection, and strengthened\r\nby the energies of conscience, against the obstacles of self interest\r\nto an acquiescence in the rights of others; that of the slave is to\r\nbe prepared by instruction and habit for self government, and for the\r\nhonest pursuits of industry and social duty. Both of these courses of\r\npreparation require time, and the former must precede the latter. Some\r\nprogress is sensibly made in it; yet not so much as I had hoped and\r\nexpected. But it will yield in time to temperate and steady pursuit, to\r\nthe enlargement of the human mind, and its advancement in science. We\r\nare not in a world ungoverned by the laws and the power of a superior\r\nagent. Our efforts are in his hand, and directed by it; and he will\r\ngive them their effect in his own time. Where the disease is most deeply\r\nseated, there it will be slowest in eradication. In the northern States\r\nit was merely superficial, and easily corrected. In the southern it is\r\nincorporated with the whole system, and requires time, patience, and\r\nperseverance in the curative process. That it may finally be effected,\r\nand its progress hastened, will be the last and fondest prayer of him\r\nwho now salutes you with respect and consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. DUPONT DE NEMOURS.\r\n\r\n                                                  MONTICELLO, May 15, 1815.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR FRIEND,--The newspapers tell us you are arrived in the United\r\nStates. I congratulate my country on this as a manifestation that you\r\nconsider its civil advantages as more than equivalent to the physical\r\ncomforts and social delights of a country which possesses both in the\r\nhighest degree of any one on earth. You despair of your country, and so\r\ndo I. A military despotism is now fixed upon it permanently, especially if\r\nthe son of the tyrant should have virtues and talents. What a treat would\r\nit be to me, to be with you, and to learn from you all the intrigues,\r\napostasies and treacheries which have produced this last death's blow\r\nto the hopes of France. For, although not in the will, there was in the\r\nimbecility of the Bourbons a foundation of hope that the patriots of\r\nFrance might obtain a moderate representative government. Here you will\r\nfind rejoicings on this event, and by a strange _qui pro quo_, not by\r\nthe party hostile to liberty, but by its zealous friends. In this they\r\nsee nothing but the scourge reproduced for the back of England, they do\r\nnot permit themselves to see in it the blast of all the hopes of mankind,\r\nand that however it may jeopardize England, it gives to her self-defence\r\nthe lying countenance again of being the sole champion of the rights of\r\nman, to which in all other nations she is most adverse. I wrote to you\r\non the 28th of February, by a Mr. Ticknor, then proposing to sail for\r\nFrance, but the conclusion of peace induced him to go first to England.\r\nI hope he will keep my letter out of the post offices of France; for it\r\nwas written for the inspection of those now in power. You will now be\r\na witness of our deplorable ignorance in finance and political economy\r\ngenerally. I mentioned in my letter of February that I was endeavoring\r\nto get your memoir on that subject printed. I have not yet succeeded. I\r\nam just setting out to a distant possession of mine, and shall be absent\r\nthree weeks. God bless you.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n                                                 MONTICELLO, June 10, 1815.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--It is long since we have exchanged a letter, and yet what\r\nvolumes might have been written on the occurrences even of the last three\r\nmonths. In the first place, peace, God bless it! has returned to put us\r\nall again into a course of lawful and laudable pursuits; a new trial of\r\nthe Bourbons has proved to the world their incompetence to the functions\r\nof the station they have occupied; and the recall of the usurper has\r\nclothed him with the semblance of a legitimate autocrat. If adversity\r\nshould have taught him wisdom, of which I have little expectation, he may\r\nyet render some service to mankind, by teaching the ancient dynasties\r\nthat they can be changed for misrule, and by wearing down the maritime\r\npower of England to limitable and safe dimensions. But it is not possible\r\nhe should love us; and of that our commerce had sufficient proof during\r\nhis power. Our military achievements, indeed, which he is capable of\r\nestimating, may, in some degree, moderate the effect of his aversions;\r\nand he may perhaps fancy that we are to become the natural enemies of\r\nEngland, as England herself has so steadily endeavored to make us, and\r\nas some of our own over-zealous patriots would be willing to proclaim;\r\nand, in this view, he may admit a cold toleration of some intercourse\r\nand commerce between the two nations. He has certainly had time to see\r\nthe folly of turning the industry of France from the cultures for which\r\nnature has so highly endowed her, to those of sugar, cotton, tobacco,\r\nand others, which the same creative power has given to other climates;\r\nand, on the whole, if he can conquer the passions of his tyrannical soul,\r\nif he has understanding enough to pursue from motives of interest, what\r\nno moral motives lead him to, the tranquil happiness and prosperity of\r\nhis country, rather than a ravenous thirst for human blood, his return\r\nmay become of more advantage than injury to us. And if, again, some\r\ngreat man could arise in England, who could see and correct the follies\r\nof his nation in their conduct as to us, and by exercising justice and\r\ncomity towards ours, bring both into a state of temperate and useful\r\nfriendship, it is possible we might thus attain the place we ought to\r\noccupy between these two nations, without being degraded to the condition\r\nof mere partisans of either.\r\n\r\nA little time will now inform us, whether France, within its proper\r\nlimits, is big enough for its ruler, on the one hand, and whether, on the\r\nother, the allied powers are either wicked or foolish enough to attempt\r\nthe forcing on the French a ruler and government which they refuse?\r\nWhether they will risk their own thrones to re-establish that of the\r\nBourbons? If this is attempted, and the European world again committed\r\nto war, will the jealousy of England at the commerce which neutrality\r\nwill give us, induce her again to add us to the number of her enemies,\r\nrather than see us prosper in the pursuit of peace and industry? And\r\nhave our commercial citizens merited from their country its encountering\r\nanother war to protect their gambling enterprises? That the persons\r\nof our citizens shall be safe in freely traversing the ocean, that the\r\ntransportation of our own produce, in our own vessels, to the markets\r\nof our choice, and the return to us of the articles we want for our own\r\nuse, shall be unmolested, I hold to be fundamental, and the gauntlet\r\nthat must be for ever hurled at him who questions it. But whether we\r\nshall engage in every war of Europe, to protect the mere agency of our\r\nmerchants and ship-owners in carrying on the commerce of other nations,\r\neven were these merchants and ship-owners to take the side of their\r\ncountry in the contest, instead of that of the enemy, is a question of\r\ndeep and serious consideration, with which, however, you and I shall\r\nhave nothing to do; so we will leave it to those whom it will concern.\r\n\r\nI thank you for making known to me Mr. Ticknor and Mr. Gray. They are fine\r\nyoung men, indeed, and if Massachusetts can raise a few more such, it is\r\nprobable she would be better counselled as to social rights and social\r\nduties. Mr. Ticknor is, particularly, the best bibliograph I have met\r\nwith, and very kindly and opportunely offered me the means of re-procuring\r\nsome part of the literary treasures which I have ceded to Congress, to\r\nreplace the devastations of British Vandalism at Washington. I cannot\r\nlive without books. But fewer will suffice, where amusement, and not\r\nuse, is the only future object. I am about sending him a catalogue, to\r\nwhich less than his critical knowledge of books would hardly be adequate.\r\n\r\nPresent my high respects to Mrs. Adams, and accept yourself the assurance\r\nof my affectionate attachment.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. W. H. TORRANCE.\r\n\r\n                                                 MONTICELLO, June 11, 1815.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I received a few days ago your favor of May 5th, stating a question\r\non a law of the State of Georgia which suspends judgments for a limited\r\ntime, and asking my opinion whether it may be valid under the inhibition\r\nof our constitution to pass laws impairing the obligations of contracts.\r\nIt is more than forty years since I have quitted the practice of the\r\nlaw, and been engaged in vocations which furnished little occasion of\r\npreserving a familiarity with that science. I am far, therefore, from\r\nbeing qualified to decide on the problems it presents, and certainly\r\nnot disposed to obtrude in a case where gentlemen have been consulted\r\nof the first qualifications, and of actual and daily familiarity with\r\nthe subject, especially too in a question on the law of another State.\r\nWe have in this State a law resembling in some degree that you quote,\r\nsuspending executions until a year after the treaty of peace; but no\r\nquestion under it has been raised before the courts. It is also, I\r\nbelieve, expected that when this shall expire, in consideration of the\r\nabsolute impossibility of procuring coin to satisfy judgments, a law\r\nwill be passed, similar to that passed in England, on suspending the\r\ncash payments of their bank, that provided that on refusal by a party to\r\nreceive notes of the Bank of England in any case either of past or future\r\ncontracts, the judgment should be suspended during the continuance of\r\nthat act, bearing, however, legal interest. They seemed to consider that\r\nit was not this law which changed the conditions of the contract, but the\r\ncircumstances which had arisen, and had rendered its literal execution\r\nimpossible; by the disappearance of the metallic medium stipulated by\r\nthe contract, that the parties not concurring in a reasonable and just\r\naccommodation, it became the duty of the legislature to arbitrate between\r\nthem; and that less restrained than the Duke of Venice by the letter of\r\ndecree, they were free to adjudge to Shylock a reasonable equivalent.\r\nAnd I believe that in our States this umpirage of the legislatures has\r\nbeen generally interposed in cases where a literal execution of contract\r\nhas, by a change of circumstances, become impossible, or, if enforced,\r\nwould produce a disproportion between the subject of the contract and its\r\nprice, which the parties did not contemplate at the time of the contract.\r\n\r\nThe second question, whether the judges are invested with exclusive\r\nauthority to decide on the constitutionality of a law, has been heretofore\r\na subject of consideration with me in the exercise of official duties.\r\nCertainly there is not a word in the constitution which has given\r\nthat power to them more than to the executive or legislative branches.\r\nQuestions of property, of character and of crime being ascribed to the\r\njudges, through a definite course of legal proceeding, laws involving\r\nsuch questions belong, of course, to them; and as they decide on them\r\nultimately and without appeal, they of course decide _for themselves_. The\r\nconstitutional validity of the law or laws again prescribing executive\r\naction, and to be administered by that branch ultimately and without\r\nappeal, the executive must decide for _themselves_ also, whether, under\r\nthe constitution, they are valid or not. So also as to laws governing\r\nthe proceedings of the legislature, that body must judge _for itself_\r\nthe constitutionality of the law, and equally without appeal or control\r\nfrom its co-ordinate branches. And, in general, that branch which is to\r\nact ultimately, and without appeal, on any law, is the rightful expositor\r\nof the validity of the law, uncontrolled by the opinions of the other\r\nco-ordinate authorities. It may be said that contradictory decisions may\r\narise in such case, and produce inconvenience. This is possible, and is\r\na necessary failing in all human proceedings. Yet the prudence of the\r\npublic functionaries, and authority of public opinion, will generally\r\nproduce accommodation. Such an instance of difference occurred between\r\nthe judges of England (in the time of Lord Holt) and the House of\r\nCommons, but the prudence of those bodies prevented inconvenience from\r\nit. So in the cases of Duane and of William Smith of South Carolina,\r\nwhose characters of citizenship stood precisely on the same ground, the\r\njudges in a question of meum and tuum which came before them, decided\r\nthat Duane was not a citizen; and in a question of membership, the\r\nHouse of Representatives, under the same words of the same provision,\r\nadjudged William Smith to be a citizen. Yet no inconvenience has ensued\r\nfrom these contradictory decisions. This is what I believe myself to\r\nbe sound. But there is another opinion entertained by some men of such\r\njudgment and information as to lessen my confidence in my own. That is,\r\nthat the legislature alone is the exclusive expounder of the sense of\r\nthe constitution, in every part of it whatever. And they allege in its\r\nsupport, that this branch has authority to impeach and punish a member\r\nof either of the others acting contrary to its declaration of the sense\r\nof the constitution. It may indeed be answered, that an act may still be\r\nvalid although the party is punished for it, right or wrong. However,\r\nthis opinion which ascribes exclusive exposition to the legislature,\r\nmerits respect for its safety, there being in the body of the nation a\r\ncontrol over them, which, if expressed by rejection on the subsequent\r\nexercise of their elective franchise, enlists public opinion against their\r\nexposition, and encourages a judge or executive on a future occasion to\r\nadhere to their former opinion. Between these two doctrines, every one\r\nhas a right to choose, and I know of no third meriting any respect.\r\n\r\nI have thus, Sir, frankly, without the honor of your acquaintance,\r\nconfided to you my opinion; trusting assuredly that no use will be made\r\nof it which shall commit me to the contentions of the newspapers. From\r\nthat field of disquietude my age asks exemption, and permission to enjoy\r\nthe privileged tranquillity of a private and unmeddling citizen. In this\r\nconfidence accept the assurances of my respect and consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. LEIPER.\r\n\r\n                                                 MONTICELLO, June 12, 1815.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--A journey soon after the receipt of your favor of April the\r\n17th, and an absence from home of some continuance, have prevented my\r\nearlier acknowledgment of it. In that came safely my letter of January\r\nthe 2d, 1814. In our principles of government we differ not at all;\r\nnor in the general object and tenor of political measures. We concur\r\nin considering the government of England as totally without morality,\r\ninsolent beyond bearing, inflated with vanity and ambition, aiming at\r\nthe exclusive dominion of the sea, lost in corruption, of deep-rooted\r\nhatred towards us, hostile to liberty wherever it endeavors to show\r\nits head, and the eternal disturber of the peace of the world. In our\r\nestimate of Bonaparte, I suspect we differ. I view him as a political\r\nengine only, and a very wicked one; you, I believe, as both political\r\nand religious, and obeying, as an instrument, an unseen hand. I still\r\ndeprecate his becoming sole lord of the continent of Europe, which he\r\nwould have been, had he reached in triumph the gates of St. Petersburg.\r\nThe establishment in our day of another Roman empire, spreading vassalage\r\nand depravity over the face of the globe, is not, I hope, within the\r\npurposes of Heaven. Nor does the return of Bonaparte give me pleasure\r\nunmixed; I see in his expulsion of the Bourbons, a valuable lesson to\r\nthe world, as showing that its ancient dynasties may be changed for\r\ntheir misrule. Should the allied powers presume to dictate a ruler and\r\ngovernment to France, and follow the example he had set of parcelling\r\nand usurping to themselves their neighbor nations, I hope he will give\r\nthem another lesson in vindication of the rights of independence and\r\nself-government, which himself had heretofore so much abused; and that\r\nin this contest he will wear down the maritime power of England to\r\nlimitable and safe dimensions. So far, good. It cannot be denied, on\r\nthe other hand, that his successful perversion of the force (committed\r\nto him for vindicating the rights and liberties of his country) to\r\nusurp its government, and to enchain it under an hereditary despotism,\r\nis of baneful effect in encouraging future usurpations, and deterring\r\nthose under oppression from rising to redress themselves. His restless\r\nspirit leaves no hope of peace to the world; and his hatred of us is\r\nonly a little less than that he bears to England, and England to us.\r\nOur form of government is odious to him, as a standing contrast between\r\nrepublican and despotic rule; and as much from that hatred, as from\r\nignorance in political economy, he had excluded intercourse between us\r\nand his people, by prohibiting the only articles they wanted from us,\r\nthat is, cotton and tobacco. Whether the war we have had with England,\r\nand the achievements of that war, and the hope that we may become his\r\ninstruments and partisans against that enemy, may induce him, in future,\r\nto tolerate our commercial intercourse with his people, is still to be\r\nseen. For my part, I wish that all nations may recover and retain their\r\nindependence; that those which are overgrown may not advance beyond safe\r\nmeasures of power, that a salutary balance may be ever maintained among\r\nnations, and that our peace, commerce, and friendship, may be sought\r\nand cultivated by all. It is our business to manufacture for ourselves\r\nwhatever we can, to keep our markets open for what we can spare or want;\r\nand the less we have to do with the amities or enmities of Europe, the\r\nbetter. Not in our day, but at no distant one, we may shake a rod over\r\nthe heads of all, which may make the stoutest of them tremble. But I\r\nhope our wisdom will grow with our power, and teach us, that the less\r\nwe use our power, the greater it will be.\r\n\r\nThe federal misrepresentation of my sentiments, which occasioned my\r\nformer letter to you, was gross enough; but that and all others are\r\nexceeded by the impudence and falsehood of the printed extract you\r\nsent me from Ralph's paper. That a continuance of the embargo for two\r\nmonths longer would have prevented our war; that the non-importation law\r\nwhich succeeded it was a wise and powerful measure, I have constantly\r\nmaintained. My friendship for Mr. Madison, my confidence in his wisdom\r\nand virtue, and my approbation of all his measures, and especially of his\r\ntaking up at length the gauntlet against England, is known to all with\r\nwhom I have ever conversed or corresponded on these measures. The word\r\n_federal_, or its synonyma _lie_, may therefore be written under every\r\nword of Mr. Ralph's paragraph. I have ransacked my memory to recollect\r\nany incident which might have given countenance to any particle of it,\r\nbut I find none. For if you will except the bringing into power and\r\nimportance those who were enemies to himself as well as to the principles\r\nof republican government, I do not recollect a single measure of the\r\nPresident which I have not approved. Of those under him, and of some very\r\nnear him, there have been many acts of which we have all disapproved,\r\nand he more than we. We have at times dissented from the measures,\r\nand lamented the dilatoriness of Congress. I recollect an instance the\r\nfirst winter of the war, when, from sloth of proceedings, an embargo was\r\npermitted to run through the winter, while the enemy could not cruise,\r\nnor consequently restrain the exportation of our whole produce, and was\r\ntaken off in the spring, as soon as they could resume their stations.\r\nBut this procrastination is unavoidable. How can expedition be expected\r\nfrom a body which we have saddled with an hundred lawyers, whose trade\r\nis talking? But lies, to sow division among us, is so stale an artifice\r\nof the federal prints, and are so well understood, that they need neither\r\ncontradiction nor explanation. As to myself, my confidence in the wisdom\r\nand integrity of the administration is so entire, that I scarcely notice\r\nwhat is passing, and have almost ceased to read newspapers. Mine remain\r\nin our post office a week or ten days, sometimes, unasked for. I find\r\nmore amusement in studies to which I was always more attached, and from\r\nwhich I was dragged by the events of the times in which I have happened\r\nto live.\r\n\r\nI rejoice exceedingly that our war with England was single-handed. In\r\nthat of the Revolution, we had France, Spain, and Holland on our side,\r\nand the credit of its success was given to them. On the late occasion,\r\nunprepared and unexpecting war, we were compelled to declare it, and to\r\nreceive the attack of England, just issuing from a general war, fully\r\narmed, and freed from all other enemies, and have not only made her\r\nsick of it, but glad to prevent, by peace, the capture of her adjacent\r\npossessions, which one or two campaigns more would infallibly have made\r\nours. She has found that we can do her more injury than any other enemy\r\non earth, and henceforward will better estimate the value of our peace.\r\nBut whether her government has power, in opposition to the aristocracy\r\nof her navy, to restrain their piracies within the limits of national\r\nrights, may well be doubted. I pray, therefore, for peace, as best for\r\nall the world, best for us, and best for me, who have already lived to\r\nsee three wars, and now pant for nothing more than to be permitted to\r\ndepart in peace. That you also, who have longer to live, may continue to\r\nenjoy this blessing with health and prosperity, through as long a life\r\nas you desire, is the prayer of yours affectionately.\r\n\r\nP. S. June the 14th.--Before I had sent my letter to the post office, I\r\nreceived the new treaty of the allied powers, declaring that the French\r\nnation shall not have Bonaparte, and shall have Louis XVIII. for their\r\nruler. They are all then as great rascals as Bonaparte himself. While he\r\nwas in the wrong, I wished him exactly as much success as would answer\r\nour purposes, and no more. Now that they are wrong and he in the right,\r\nhe shall have all my prayers for success, and that he may dethrone every\r\nman of them.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. MAURY.\r\n\r\n                                                 MONTICELLO, June 15, 1815.\r\n\r\nI congratulate you, my dear and ancient friend, on the return of peace,\r\nand the restoration of intercourse between our two countries. What has\r\npassed may be a lesson to both of the injury which either can do the\r\nother, and the peace now opened may show what would be the value of a\r\ncordial friendship; and I hope the first moments of it will be employed\r\nto remove the stumbling block which must otherwise keep us eternal\r\nenemies. I mean the impressment of our citizens. This was the sole object\r\nof the continuance of the late war, which the repeal of the orders of\r\ncouncil would otherwise have ended at its beginning. If according to our\r\nestimates, England impressed into her navy 6,000 of our citizens, let\r\nher count the cost of the war, and a greater number of men lost in it,\r\nand she will find this resource for manning her navy the most expensive\r\nshe can adopt, each of these men having cost her £30,000 sterling, and a\r\nman of her own besides. On that point we have thrown away the scabbard,\r\nand the moment an European war brings her back to this practice, adds us\r\nagain to her enemies. But I hope an arrangement is already made on this\r\nsubject. Have you no statesmen who can look forward two or three score\r\nyears? It is but forty years since the battle of Lexington. One-third of\r\nthose now living saw that day, when we were about two millions of people,\r\nand have lived to see this, when we are ten millions. One-third of those\r\nnow living, who see us at ten millions, will live another forty years, and\r\nsee us forty millions; and looking forward only through such a portion\r\nof time as has passed since you and I were scanning Virgil together,\r\n(which I believe is near three score years,) we shall be seen to have a\r\npopulation of eighty millions, and of not more than double the average\r\ndensity of the present. What may not such a people be worth to England\r\nas customers and friends? and what might she not apprehend from such\r\na nation as enemies? Now, what is the price we ask for our friendship?\r\nJustice, and the comity usually observed between nation and nation. Would\r\nthere not be more of dignity in this, more character and satisfaction,\r\nthan in her teasings and harassings, her briberies and intrigues, to\r\nsow party discord among us, which can never have more effect here than\r\nthe opposition within herself has there; which can never obstruct the\r\nbegetting children, the efficient source of growth; and by nourishing a\r\ndeadly hatred, will only produce and hasten events which both of us, in\r\nmoments of sober reflection, should deplore and deprecate. One half of the\r\nattention employed in decent observances towards our government, would\r\nbe worth more to her than all the Yankee duperies played off upon her,\r\nat a great expense on her part of money and meanness, and of nourishment\r\nto the vices and treacheries of the Henrys and Hulls of both nations. As\r\nwe never can be at war with any other nation, (for no other nation can\r\nget at us but Spain, and her own people will manage her,) the idea may\r\nbe generated that we are natural enemies, and a calamitous one it will\r\nbe to both. I hope in God her government will come to a sense of this,\r\nand will see that honesty and interest are as intimately connected in the\r\npublic as in the private code of morality. Her ministers have been weak\r\nenough to believe from the newspapers that Mr. Madison and myself are\r\npersonally her enemies. Such an idea is unworthy a man of sense; as we\r\nshould have been unworthy our trusts could we have felt such a motive of\r\npublic action. No two men in the United States have more sincerely wished\r\nfor cordial friendship with her; not as her vassals or dirty partisans,\r\nbut as members of co-equal States, respecting each other, and sensible\r\nof the good as well as the harm each is capable of doing the other. On\r\nthis ground there was never a moment we did not wish to embrace her.\r\nBut repelled by their aversions, feeling their hatred at every point\r\nof contact, and justly indignant at its supercilious manifestations,\r\nthat happened which has happened, that will follow which must follow,\r\nin progressive ratio, while such dispositions continue to be indulged.\r\nI hope they will see this, and do their part towards healing the minds\r\nand cooling the temper of both nations. The irritation here is great\r\nand general, because the mode of warfare both on the maritime and inland\r\nfrontiers has been most exasperating. We perceive the English passions\r\nto be high also, nourished by the newspapers, that first of all human\r\ncontrivances for generating war. But it is the office of the rulers on\r\nboth sides to rise above these vulgar vehicles of passion; to assuage\r\nangry feelings, and by examples and expressions of mutual regard in\r\ntheir public intercourse, to lead their citizens into good temper with\r\neach other. No one feels more indignation than myself when reflecting on\r\nthe insults and injuries of that country to this. But the interests of\r\nboth require that these should be left to history, and in the meantime\r\nbe smothered in the living mind. I have indeed little personal concern\r\nin it. Time is drawing her curtain on me. But I should make my bow with\r\nmore satisfaction, if I had more hope of seeing our countries shake hands\r\ntogether cordially. In this sentiment I am sure you are with me, and\r\nthis assurance must apologize for my indulging myself in expressing it\r\nto you, with that of my constant and affectionate friendship and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. MAURY.\r\n\r\n                                                 MONTICELLO, June 16, 1815.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR,--Just as I was about to close my preceding letter, yours of\r\nApril 29th is put into my hands, and with it the papers your kindness\r\nforwards to me. I am glad to see in them expressions of regard for our\r\nfriendship and intercourse from one side of the houses of parliament. But\r\nI would rather have seen them from the other, if not from both. What comes\r\nfrom the opposition is understood to be the converse of the sentiments\r\nof the government, and we would not there, as they do here, give up the\r\ngovernment for the opposition. The views of the Prince and his ministers\r\nare unfortunately to be taken from the speech of Earl Bathurst, in one\r\nof the papers you sent me. But what is incomprehensible to me is that\r\nthe Marquis of Wellesley, advocating us, on the ground of opposition,\r\nsays that \"the aggression which led to the war, was from the United\r\nStates, not from England.\" Is there a person in the world who, knowing\r\nthe circumstances, thinks this? The acts which produced the war were,\r\n1st, the impressment of our citizens by their ships of war, and, 2d, the\r\norders of council forbidding our vessels to trade with any country but\r\nEngland, without going to England to obtain a special license. On the\r\nfirst subject the British minister declared to our Chargé, Mr. Russel,\r\nthat this practice of their ships of war would not be discontinued, and\r\nthat no admissible arrangement could be proposed; and as to the second,\r\nthe Prince Regent, by his proclamation of April 21st, 1812, declared in\r\neffect solemnly that he would not revoke the orders of council _as to us_,\r\non the ground that Bonaparte had revoked his decrees _as to us_; that,\r\non the contrary, we should continue under them until Bonaparte should\r\nrevoke _as to all the world_. These categorical and definite answers\r\nput an end to negotiation, and were a declaration of a continuance of\r\nthe war in which they had already taken from us one thousand ships and\r\nsix thousand seamen. We determined then to defend ourselves, and to\r\noppose further hostilities by war on our side also. Now, had we taken\r\none thousand British ships and six thousand of her seamen without any\r\ndeclaration of war, would the Marquis of Wellesley have considered a\r\ndeclaration of war by Great Britain as an aggression on her part? They\r\nsay we denied their maritime rights. We never denied a single one. It\r\nwas their taking our citizens, native as well as naturalized, for which\r\nwe went into war, and because they forbade us to trade with any nation\r\nwithout entering and paying duties in their ports on both the outward\r\nand inward cargo. Thus to carry a cargo of cotton from Savanna to St.\r\nMary's, and take returns in fruits, for example, our vessel was to go to\r\nEngland, enter and pay a duty on her cottons there, return to St. Mary's,\r\nthen go back to England to enter and pay a duty on her fruits, and then\r\nreturn to Savanna, after crossing the Atlantic four times, and paying\r\ntributes on both cargoes to England, instead of the direct passage of a\r\nfew hours. And the taking ships for not doing this, the Marquis says, is\r\nno aggression. However, it is now all over, and I hope forever over. Yet\r\nI should have had more confidence in this, had the friendly expressions\r\nof the Marquis come from the ministers of the Prince. On the contrary,\r\nwe see them scarcely admitting that the war ought to have been ended.\r\nEarl Bathurst shuffles together chaotic ideas merely to darken and cover\r\nthe views of the ministers in protracting the war; the truth being, that\r\nthey expected to give us an exemplary scourging, to separate from us\r\nthe States east of the Hudson, take for their Indian allies those west\r\nof the Ohio, placing three hundred thousand American citizens under the\r\ngovernment of the savages, and to leave the residuum a powerless enemy,\r\nif not submissive subjects. I cannot conceive what is the use of your\r\nBedlam when such men are out of it. And yet that such were their views\r\nwe have evidence, under the hand of their Secretary of State in Henry's\r\ncase, and of their Commissioners at Ghent. Even now they insinuate\r\nthe peace in Europe has not suspended the practices which produced the\r\nwar. I trust, however, they are speaking a different language to our\r\nministers, and join in the hope you express that the provocations which\r\noccasioned the late rupture will not be repeated. The interruption of\r\nour intercourse with England has rendered us one essential service in\r\nplanting radically and firmly coarse manufactures among us. I make in\r\nmy family two thousand yards of cloth a year, which I formerly bought\r\nfrom England, and it only employs a few women, children and invalids,\r\nwho could do little on the farm. The State generally does the same,\r\nand allowing ten yards to a person, this amounts to ten millions of\r\nyards; and if we are about the medium degree of manufacturers in the\r\nwhole Union, as I believe we are, the whole will amount to one hundred\r\nmillions of yards a year, which will soon reimburse us the expenses of\r\nthe war. Carding machines in every neighborhood, spinning machines in\r\nlarge families and wheels in the small, are too radically established\r\never to be relinquished. The finer fabrics perhaps, and even probably,\r\nwill be sought again in Europe, except broad-cloth, which the vast\r\nmultiplication of merinos among us will enable us to make much cheaper\r\nthan can be done in Europe.\r\n\r\nYour practice of the cold bath thrice a week during the winter, and at\r\nthe age of seventy, is a bold one, which I should not, _à priori_, have\r\npronounced salutary. But all theory must yield to experience, and every\r\nconstitution has its own laws. I have for fifty years bathed my feet in\r\ncold water every morning (as you mention), and having been remarkably\r\nexempted from colds (not having had one in every seven years of my life\r\non an average), I have supposed it might be ascribed to that practice.\r\nWhen we see two facts accompanying one another for a long time, we are\r\napt to suppose them related as cause and effect.\r\n\r\nOur tobacco trade is strangely changed. We no longer know how to fit\r\nthe plant to the market. Differences of from four to twelve dollars the\r\nhundred are now made on qualities appearing to us entirely whimsical.\r\nThe British orders of council had obliged us to abandon the culture\r\ngenerally; we are now, however, returning to it, and experience will\r\nsoon decide what description of lands may continue it to advantage.\r\nThose which produce the qualities under seven or eight dollars, must,\r\nI think, relinquish it finally. Your friends here are well as far as I\r\nhave heard. So I hope you are; and that you may continue so as long as\r\nyou shall think the continuance of life itself desirable, is the prayer\r\nof yours sincerely and affectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS TO THOMAS JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n                                                     QUINCY, June 20, 1815.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--The fit of recollection came upon both of us so nearly at\r\nthe same time, that I may, some time or other, begin to think there\r\nis something in Priestley's and Hartley's vibrations. The day before\r\nyesterday I sent to the post-office a letter to you, and last night I\r\nreceived your kind favor of the 10th.\r\n\r\nThe question before the human race is, whether the God of Nature shall\r\ngovern the world by his own laws, or whether priests and kings shall\r\nrule it by fictitious miracles? Or, in other words, whether authority is\r\noriginally in the people? or whether it has descended for 1800 years in\r\na succession of popes and bishops, or brought down from heaven by the\r\nHoly Ghost in the form of a dove, in a phial of holy oil?\r\n\r\nWho shall take the side of God and Nature? Brachmans? Mandarins? Druids?\r\nor Tecumseh and his brother the prophet? Or shall we become disciples\r\nof the Philosophers? And who are the Philosophers? Frederic? Voltaire?\r\nRousseau? Buffon? Diderot? or Condorsett? These philosophers have shown\r\nthemselves as incapable of governing mankind, as the Bourbons or the\r\nGuelphs. Condorsett has let the cat out of the bag. He has made precious\r\nconfessions. I regret that I have only an English translation of his\r\n\"Outlines of an Historical View of the Progress of the Human mind.\" But\r\nin pages 247, 248, and 249, you will find it frankly acknowledged, that\r\nthe philosophers of the eighteenth century, adopted all the maxims,\r\nand practiced all the arts of the Pharisees, the ancient priests of all\r\ncountries, the Jesuits, the Machiavillians, &c., &c., to overthrow the\r\ninstitutions that such arts had established. This new philosophy was, by\r\nhis own account, as insidious, fraudulent, hypocritical, and cruel, as\r\nthe old policy of the priests, nobles, and kings. When and where were\r\never found, or will be found, sincerity, honesty, or veracity, in any\r\nsect or party in religion, government, or philosophy? Johnson and Burke\r\nwere more of Catholics than Protestants at heart, and Gibbon became an\r\nadvocate for the inquisition.\r\n\r\nThere is no act of uniformity in the Church, or State, philosophic.\r\nAs many sects and systems among them, as among Quakers and Baptists.\r\nBonaparte will not revive inquisitions, Jesuits, or slave trade, for\r\nwhich habitudes the Bourbons have been driven again into exile.\r\n\r\nWe shall get along with, or without war. I have at last procured the\r\nMarquis D'Argens' Occellus, Timæus, and Julian. Three such volumes I\r\nnever read. They are a most perfect exemplification of Condorsett's\r\nprecious confessions. It is astonishing they have not made more noise\r\nin the world. Our Athanasians have printed in a pamphlet in Boston, your\r\nletters and Priestley's from Belsham's Lindsey. It will do you no harm.\r\nOur correspondence shall not again be so long interrupted. Affectionately.\r\n\r\nMrs. Adams thanks Mr. Jefferson for his friendly remembrance of her,\r\nand reciprocates to him a thousand good wishes.\r\n\r\nP. S. Ticknor and Gray were highly delighted with their visit; charmed\r\nwith the whole family. Have you read Carnot? Is it not afflicting to see\r\na man of such large views, so many noble sentiments, and such exalted\r\nintegrity, groping in the dark for a remedy, a balance, or a mediator\r\nbetween independence and despotism? How shall his \"love of country,\"\r\n\"his honor,\" and his \"national spirit,\" be produced?\r\n\r\nI cannot write a hundredth part of what I wish to say to you.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS TO THOMAS JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n                                                     QUINCY, June 22, 1815.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Can you give me any information concerning A. G. Camus?\r\nIs he a Chateaubriand? or a Marquis D'Argens? Does he mean to abolish\r\nChristianity? or to restore the Inquisition, the Jesuits, the Pope and\r\nthe Devil?\r\n\r\nWithin a few days I have received a thing as unexpected to me as an\r\napparition from the dead: Rapport à l'Institut National. Par A. G. Camus,\r\nimprimè par ordre de l'Institut, Pluviose An XI.\r\n\r\nIn page 55 of this report, he says, \"Certain pieces which I found in the\r\nchamber of accounts in Brussels, gave me useful indications concerning\r\nthe grand collection of the Bollandists; and conducted me to make\r\nresearches into the state of that work, unfortunately interrupted at\r\nthis day. It would add to the Institute to propose to government the\r\nmeans of completing it; as it has done with success for the collection\r\nof the historians of France, of diplomas and ordinances.[14]\"\r\n\r\nPermit me to dwell a few minutes on this important work.\r\n\r\n\"Almost all the history of Europe, and a part of that of the east, from\r\nthe seventh century to the thirteenth, is in the lives of personages to\r\nwhom have been given the title of Saints. Every one may have remarked,\r\nthat in reading history, there is no event of any importance, in civil\r\norder, in which some Bishop, some Abbé, some Monk, or some Saint, did not\r\ntake a part. It is, therefore, a great service, rendered by the Jesuits\r\n(known under the name of the Bollandists) to those who would write\r\nhistory, to have formed the immense collection, extended to fifty-two\r\nvolumes in folio, known under the title of the Acts of the Saints. The\r\nservice they have rendered to literature, is considerably augmented, by\r\nthe insertion, in their acts of the Saints, a great number of diplomas\r\nand dissertations, the greatest part of which are models of criticism.\r\nThere is no man, among the learned, who does not interest himself in this\r\ngreat collection. My intention is not to recall to your recollection\r\nthe original authors, or their first labors. We may easily know them\r\nby turning over the leaves of the collection, or if we would find the\r\nresult already written, it is in the Historical Library of Mensel, T.\r\n1, part 1, p. 306, or in the Manual of Literary History, by Bougine, T.\r\n2, p. 641.\r\n\r\n\"I shall date what I have to say to you only from the epoch of the\r\nsuppression of the society, of which the Bollandists were members.\r\n\r\n\"At that time, three Jesuits were employed in the collection of the\r\nActs of the Saints; to wit, the Fathers De Bie, De Bue, and Hubens.\r\nThe Father Gesquière, who had also labored at the Acts of the Saints,\r\nreduced a particular collection, entitled Select Fragments from Belgical\r\nWriters, and extracts or references to matters contained in a collection\r\nentitled Museum of Bellarmine. These four monks inhabited the house of\r\nthe Jesuits at Antwerp. Independently of the use of the library of the\r\nconvent, the Bollandists had their particular library, the most important\r\nportion of which was a state of the Lives of the Saints for every day\r\nof the month, with indications of the books in which were found those\r\nwhich were already printed, and the original manuscripts, or the copies\r\nof manuscripts, which were not yet printed. They frequently quote this\r\nparticular collection in their general collection. The greatest part\r\nof the copies they had assembled, were the fruit of a journey of the\r\nFathers Papebrock and Henshen, made to Rome in 1660. They remained there\r\ntill 1662. Papebrock and his associate brought from Rome copies of seven\r\nhundred Lives of Saints, in Greek or in Latin. The citizen La Serna,\r\nhas in his library a copy, taken by himself, from the originals, of the\r\nrelation of the journey of Papebrock to Rome, and of the correspondence\r\nof Henshen with his colleagues. The relation and the correspondence are\r\nin Latin. See Catalogue de la Serna, T. 3, N. 3903.\r\n\r\n\"After the suppression of the Jesuits, the commissioners apposed their\r\nseals upon the library of the Bollandists, as well as on that of the\r\nJesuits of Antwerp. But Mr. Girard, then Secretary of the Academy at\r\nBrussels, who is still living, and who furnished me a part of the\r\ndocuments I use, charged with the inventory and sale of the books,\r\nwithdrew those of the Bollandists, and transported them to Brussels.\r\n\r\n\"The Academy of Brussels proposed to continue the Acts of the Saints\r\nunder its own name, and for this purpose to admit the four Jesuits\r\ninto the number of its members. The Father Gesquière alone consented to\r\nthis arrangement. The other Jesuits obtained of government, through the\r\nintervention of the Bishop of Newstadt, the assurance, that they might\r\ncontinue their collection. In effect, the Empress Maria Theresa approved,\r\nby a decree of the 19th of June, 1778, a plan which was presented to\r\nher, for the continuation of the works, both by the Bollandists and of\r\nGesquière. This plan is in ample detail. It contains twenty articles,\r\nand would be useful to consult, if any persons should resume the Acts\r\nof the Saints. The establishment of the Jesuits was fixed in the Abby of\r\nCandenberg, at Brussels; the library of the Bollandists was transported\r\nto that place; one of the monks of the Abby was associated with them;\r\nand the Father Hubens being dead, was replaced by the Father Berthod,\r\na Benedictine, who died in 1789. The Abby of Candenberg having been\r\nsuppressed, the government assigned to the Bollandists a place in the\r\nancient College of the Jesuits, at Brussels. They there placed their\r\nlibrary, and went there to live. There they published the fifty-first\r\nvolume of their collection in 1786, the fifth tome of the month of\r\nOctober, printed at Brussels, at the printing press Imperial and Royal,\r\n(in _typis Cæsario regiis_.) They had then two associates, and they\r\nflattered themselves that the Emperor would continue to furnish the\r\nexpense of their labors. Nevertheless, in 1788, the establishment of\r\nthe Bollandists was suppressed, and they even proposed to sell the\r\nstock of the printed volumes; but, by an instruction (Avis) of the 6th\r\nof December, 1788, the ecclesiastical commission superseded the sale,\r\ntill the result could be known of a negociation which the Father De Bie\r\nhad commenced with the Abbé of St. Blaise, to establish the authors,\r\nand transport the stock of the work, as well as the materials for its\r\ncontinuation at St. Blaise.\r\n\r\n\"In the meantime, the Abby of Tongerloo offered the government to\r\npurchase the library and stock of the Bollandists, and to cause the\r\nwork to be continued by the ancient Bollandists, with the monks of\r\nTongerloo associated with them. These propositions were accepted. The\r\nFathers De Bie, De Bue, and Gesquière, removed to Tongerloo; the monks\r\nof Candenberg refused to follow them, though they had been associated\r\nwith them. On the entry of the French troops into Belgium, the monks of\r\nTongerloo quitted their Abby; the Fathers De Bie, and Gesquière, retired\r\nto Germany, where they died; the Father De Bue retired to the City Hall,\r\nheretofore Province of Hainault, his native country. He lives, but is\r\nvery aged. One of the monks of Tongerloo, who had been associated with\r\nthem, is the Father Heylen; they were not able to inform me of the place\r\nof his residence. Another monk associated with the Bollandists of 1780,\r\nis the Father Fonson, who resides at Brussels.\r\n\r\n\"In the midst of these troubles, the Bollandists have caused to be printed\r\nthe fifty-second volume of the Acts of the Saints, the sixth volume of\r\nthe month of October. The fifty-first volume is not common in commerce,\r\nbecause the sale of it has been interrupted by the continual changes of\r\nthe residence of the Bollandists. The fifty-second volume, or the sixth\r\nof the same month of October, is much more rare. Few persons know its\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\n\"The citizen La Serna has given me the two hundred and ninety-six first\r\npages of the volume, which he believes were printed at Tongerloo. He is\r\npersuaded that the rest of the volume exists, and he thinks it was at\r\nRome that it was finished (_terminé_).\r\n\r\n\"The citizen De Herbonville, Prefect of the two Niths at Antwerp, has\r\nmade, for about eighteen months, attempts with the ancient Bollandists,\r\nto engage them to resume their labors. They have not had success. Perhaps\r\nthe present moment would be the most critical, (opportune,) especially\r\nif the government should consent to give to the Bollandists assurance\r\nof their safety.\r\n\r\n\"The essential point would be to make sure of the existence of the\r\nmanuscripts which I have indicated; and which, by the relation of the\r\ncitizen La Serna, filled a body of a library of about three toises in\r\nlength, and two in breadth. If these manuscripts still exist, it is\r\neasy to terminate the Acts of the Saints; because we shall have all the\r\nnecessary materials. If these manuscripts are lost, we must despair to\r\nsee this collection completed.\r\n\r\n\"I have enlarged a little on this digression on the Acts of the Saints,\r\nbecause it is a work of great importance; and because these documents,\r\nwhich cannot be obtained with any exactitude but upon the spots, seem\r\nto me to be among the principal objects which your travellers have to\r\ncollect, and of which they ought to give you an account.\"\r\n\r\nNow, my friend Jefferson! I await your observations on this morsel. You\r\nmay think I waste my time and yours. I do not think so. If you will look\r\ninto the \"Nouveau Dictionaire Historique,\" under the words \"Bollandus,\r\nHeinshernius, and Papebrock,\" you will find more particulars of the rise\r\nand progress of this great work, \"The Acts of the Saints.\"\r\n\r\nI shall make only an observation or two.\r\n\r\n1. The Pope never suppressed the work, and Maria Theresa established\r\nit. It therefore must be Catholic.\r\n\r\n2. Notwithstanding the professions of the Bollandists, to discriminate\r\nthe true from the false miracles, and the dubious from both, I suspect\r\nthat the false will be found the fewest, the dubious the next, and the\r\ntrue the most numerous of all.\r\n\r\n3. From all that I have read, of the legends, of the lives, and writings\r\nof the saints, and even of the Fathers, and of ecclesiastical history in\r\ngeneral, I have no doubt that the _Acta Sanctorum_ is the most enormous\r\nmass of lies, frauds, hypocrisy, and imposture, that ever was heaped\r\ntogether on this globe. If it were impartially consulted, it would do\r\nmore to open the eyes of mankind, than all the philosophers of the 18th\r\ncentury, who were as great hypocrites as any of the philosophers or\r\ntheologians of antiquity.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n    [14] \"The Committee of the Institute, for proposing and\r\n    superintending the literary labors, in the month of Frimaire,\r\n    An XI., wrote to the Minister of the Interior, requesting him to\r\n    give orders to the Prefect of the Dyle, and to the Prefect of the\r\n    Two Nithes, to summon the citizens De Bue, Fonson, Heyten, and\r\n    all others who had taken any part in the sequel of the work of\r\n    the Bollandists, to confer with these persons, as well concerning\r\n    the continuation of this work, as concerning the cession of the\r\n    materials destined for the continuation of it; to promise to\r\n    the continuators of the Bollandists the support of the French\r\n    Government, and to render an account of their conferences.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. CORREA.\r\n\r\n                                                 MONTICELLO, June 28, 1815.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--When I learned that you proposed to give a course of Botanical\r\nlectures in Philadelphia, I feared it would retard the promised visit\r\nto Monticello. On my return from Bedford, however, on the 4th instant,\r\nI received a letter from M. Dupont flattering me with the prospect that\r\nhe and yourself would be with us as soon as my return should be known. I\r\ntherefore in the instant wrote him of my return, and my hope of seeing\r\nyou both shortly. I am still without that pleasure, but not without\r\nthe hope. Europe has been a second time turned topsy-turvy since we\r\nwere together; and so many things have happened there that I have lost\r\nmy compass. As far as we can judge from appearances, Bonaparte, from\r\nbeing a mere military usurper, seems to have become the choice of his\r\nnation; and the allies in their turn, the usurpers and spoliators of the\r\nEuropean world. The right of nations to self-government being my polar\r\nstar, my partialities are steered by it, without asking whether it is a\r\nBonaparte or an Alexander towards whom the helm is directed. Believing\r\nthat England has enough on her hands without us, and therefore has by\r\nthis time settled the question of impressment with Mr. Adams, I look on\r\nthis new conflict of the European gladiators, as from the higher forms\r\nof the amphitheatre, wondering that man, like the wild beasts of the\r\nforest, should permit himself to be led by his keeper into the arena,\r\nthe spectacle and sport of the lookers on. Nor do I see the issue of\r\nthis tragedy with the sanguine hopes of our friend M. Dupont. I fear,\r\nfrom the experience of the last twenty-five years, that morals do not\r\nof necessity advance hand in hand with the sciences. These, however, are\r\nspeculations which may be adjourned to our meeting at Monticello, where\r\nI will continue to hope that I may receive you with our friend Dupont,\r\nand in the meantime repeat the assurances of my affectionate friendship\r\nand respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MADAME LA BARONNE DE STAEL-HOLSTEIN.\r\n\r\n                                                  MONTICELLO, July 3, 1815.\r\n\r\nDEAR MADAM,--I considered your letter of November 10th, 12th, as an\r\nevidence of the interest you were so kind as to take in the welfare of\r\nthe United States, and I was even flattered by your exhortations to\r\navoid taking any part in the war then raging in Europe, because they\r\nwere a confirmation of the policy I had myself pursued, and which I\r\nthought and still think should be the governing canon of our republic.\r\nDistance, and difference of pursuits, of interests, of connections\r\nand other circumstances, prescribe to us a different system, having\r\nno object in common with Europe, but a peaceful interchange of mutual\r\ncomforts for mutual wants. But this may not always depend on ourselves;\r\nand injuries may be so accumulated by an European power, as to pass all\r\nbounds of wise forbearance. This was our situation at the date of your\r\nletter. A long course of injuries, systematically pursued by England,\r\nand finally, formal declarations that she would neither redress nor\r\ndiscontinue their infliction, had fixed the epoch which rendered an appeal\r\nto arms unavoidable. In the letter of May 28th, 1813, which I had the\r\nhonor of writing you, I entered into such details of these injuries, and\r\nof our unremitting endeavors to bring them to a peaceable end, as the\r\nnarrow limits of a letter permitted. Resistance on our part at length\r\nbrought our enemy to reflect, to calculate, and to meet us in peaceable\r\nconferences at Ghent; but the extravagance of the pretensions brought\r\nforward by her negotiators there, when first made known in the United\r\nStates, dissipated at once every hope of a just peace, and prepared us\r\nfor a war of utter extremity. Our government, in that state of things,\r\nrespecting the opinion of the world, thought it a duty to present to it\r\na justification of the course which was likely to be forced upon us;\r\nand with this view the pamphlet was prepared which I now enclose. It\r\nwas already printed, when (instead of their ministers whom they hourly\r\nexpected from a fruitless negotiation) they received the treaty of\r\npacification signed at Ghent and ratified at London. They endeavored to\r\nsuppress the pamphlet as now unreasonable--but the proof sheets having\r\nbeen surreptitiously withdrawn, soon made their appearance in the public\r\npapers, and in the form now sent. This vindication is so exact in its\r\nfacts, so cogent in its reasonings, so authenticated by the documents\r\nto which it appeals, that it cannot fail to bring the world to a single\r\nopinion on our case. The concern you manifested on our entrance into this\r\ncontest, assures me you will take the trouble of reading it; which I wish\r\nthe more earnestly, because it will fully explain the very imperfect views\r\nwhich my letter had presented; and because we cannot be indifferent as\r\nto the opinion which yourself personally shall ultimately form of the\r\ncourse we have pursued.\r\n\r\nI learned with great pleasure your return to your native country. It is\r\nthe only one which offers elements of society analogous to the powers\r\nof your mind, and sensible of the flattering distinction of possessing\r\nthem. It is true that the great events which made an opening for your\r\nreturn, have been reversed. But not so, I hope, the circumstances which\r\nmay admit its continuance. On these events I shall say nothing. At\r\nour distance, we hear too little truth and too much falsehood to form\r\ncorrect judgments concerning them; and they are moreover foreign to\r\nour umpirage. We wish the happiness and prosperity of every nation; we\r\ndid not believe either of these promoted by the former pursuits of the\r\npresent ruler of France, and hope that his return, if the nation wills\r\nit to be permanent, may be marked by those changes which the solid good\r\nof his own country, and the peace and well-being of the world, may call\r\nfor. But these things I leave to whom they belong; the object of this\r\nletter being only to convey to you a vindication of my own country, and\r\nto have the honor on a new occasion of tendering you the homage of my\r\ngreat consideration, and respectful attachment.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ANDREW C. MITCHELL, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                                 MONTICELLO, July 16, 1815.\r\n\r\nI thank you, Sir, for the pamphlet which you have been so kind as to\r\nsend me. I have read it with attention and satisfaction. It is replete\r\nwith sound views, some of which will doubtless be adopted. Some may be\r\nchecked by difficulties. None more likely to be so than the proposition\r\nto amend the Constitution, so as to authorize Congress to tax exports.\r\nThe provision against this in the framing of that instrument, was a _sine\r\nquâ non_ with the States of peculiar productions, as rice, indigo, cotton\r\nand tobacco, to which may now be added sugar. A jealousy prevailing that\r\nto the few States producing these articles, the justice of the others\r\nmight not be a sufficient protection in opposition to their interest,\r\nthey moored themselves to this anchor. Since the hostile dispositions\r\nlately manifested by the Eastern States, they would be less willing than\r\nbefore to place themselves at their mercy; and the rather, as the Eastern\r\nStates have no exports which can be taxed equivalently. It is possible,\r\nhowever, that this difficulty might be got over; but the subject looking\r\nforward beyond my time, I leave it to those to whom its burthens and\r\nbenefits will belong, adding only my prayers for whatever may be best\r\nfor our country, and assurances to yourself of my great respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WM. WIRT, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                                MONTICELLO, August 5, 1815.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of July 24th came to hand on the 31st, and I will\r\nproceed to answer your inquiries in the order they are presented as far\r\nas I am able.\r\n\r\nI have no doubt that the fifth of the Rhode Island resolutions of which\r\nyou have sent me a copy, is exactly the one erased from our journals. The\r\nMr. Lees, and especially Richard Henry, who was industrious, had a close\r\ncorrespondence, I know, with the two Adams', and probably with others in\r\nthat and the other Eastern States; and I think it was said at the time\r\nthat copies were sent off by them to the northward the very evening of\r\nthe day on which they were passed. I can readily enough believe these\r\nresolutions were written by Mr. Henry himself. They bear the stamp of\r\nhis mind, strong without precision. That they were written by Johnson\r\nwho seconded them, was only the rumor of the day, and very possibly\r\nunfounded. But how Edmund Randolph should have said they were written\r\nby William Fleming, and Mr. Henry should have written that he showed\r\nthem to William Fleming, is to me incomprehensible. There was no William\r\nFleming then but the judge now living, whom nobody will ever suspect of\r\ntaking the lead in rebellion. I am certain he was not then a member, and\r\nI think was never a member until the revolution had made some progress.\r\nOf this, however, he will inform us with candor and truth. His eldest\r\nbrother, John Fleming, was a member, and a great speaker in debate.\r\nTo him they may have been shown. Yet I should not have expected this,\r\nbecause he was extremely attached to Robinson, Peyton Randolph, &c., and\r\nat their beck, and had no independence or boldness of mind. However,\r\nhe was attentive to his own popularity, might have been overruled by\r\nviews to that, and without correction of the christian name, Mr. Henry's\r\nnote is sufficient authority to suppose he took the popular side on\r\nthat occasion. I remember nothing to the contrary. The opposers of the\r\nresolutions were Robinson, Peyton Randolph, Pendleton, Wythe, Bland, and\r\nall the cyphers of the aristocracy. No longer possessing the journals, I\r\ncannot recollect nominally the others. They opposed them on the ground\r\nthat the same principles had been expressed in the petition, &c., of\r\nthe preceding year, to which an answer, not yet received, was daily\r\nexpected, that they were therein expressed in more conciliatory terms,\r\nand therefore more likely to have good effect. The resolutions were\r\ncarried chiefly by the vote of the middle and upper country. To state the\r\ndifferences between the classes of society and the lines of demarkation\r\nwhich separated them, would be difficult. The law, you know, admitted\r\nnone except as to the twelve counsellors. Yet in a country insulated\r\nfrom the European world, insulated from its sister colonies, with whom\r\nthere was scarcely any intercourse, little visited by foreigners, and\r\nhaving little matter to act upon within itself, certain families had\r\nrisen to splendor by wealth and the preservation of it from generation\r\nto generation under the law entails; some had produced a series of men\r\nof talents; families in general had remained stationary on the grounds\r\nof their forefathers, for there was no emigration to the westward in\r\nthose days. The wild Irish, who had gotten possession of the valley\r\nbetween the Blue Ridge and North Mountain, forming a barrier over which\r\nnone ventured to leap, and would still less venture to settle among.\r\nIn such a state of things, scarcely admitting any change of station,\r\nsociety would settle itself down into several strata, separated by no\r\nmarked lines, but shading off imperceptibly from top to bottom, nothing\r\ndisturbing the order of their repose. There were then aristocrats,\r\nhalf-breeds, pretenders, a solid independent yeomanry, looking askance\r\nat those above, yet not venturing to jostle them, and last and lowest,\r\na seculum of beings called overseers, the most abject, degraded and\r\nunprincipled race, always cap in hand to the Dons who employed them,\r\nand furnishing materials for the exercise of their pride, insolence and\r\nspirit of domination. Your characters are inimitably and justly drawn.\r\nI am not certain if more might not be said of Colonel Richard Bland. He\r\nwas the most learned and logical man of those who took prominent lead\r\nin public affairs, profound in constitutional lore, a most ungraceful\r\nspeaker, (as were Peyton Randolph and Robinson, in a remarkable degree.)\r\nHe wrote the first pamphlet on the nature of the connection with Great\r\nBritain which had any pretension to accuracy of view on that subject, but\r\nit was a singular one. He would set out on sound principles, pursue them\r\nlogically till he found them leading to the precipice which he had to\r\nleap, start back alarmed, then resume his ground, go over it in another\r\ndirection, be led again by the correctness of his reasoning to the same\r\nplace, and again back about, and try other processes to reconcile right\r\nand wrong, but finally left his reader and himself bewildered between\r\nthe steady index of the compass in their hand, and the phantasm to which\r\nit seemed to point. Still there was more sound matter in his pamphlet\r\nthan in the celebrated Farmer's letters, which were really but an _ignus\r\nfatuus_, misleading us from true principles.\r\n\r\nLandon Carter's measure you may take from the first volume of the American\r\nPhilosophical transactions, where he has one or more long papers on the\r\nweavil, and perhaps other subjects. His speeches, like his writings,\r\nwere dull, vapid, verbose, egotistical, smooth as the lullaby of the\r\nnurse, and commanding, like that, the repose only of the hearer.\r\n\r\nYou ask if you may quote me, first, for the loan office; second, Phillips'\r\ncase; and third, the addresses prepared for Congress by Henry and Lee.\r\nFor the two first certainly, because within my own knowledge, especially\r\nciting the record in Phillips' case, which of itself refutes the diatribes\r\npublished on that subject; but not for the addresses, because I was not\r\npresent, nor know anything relative to them but by hearsay from others.\r\nMy first and principal information on that subject I know I had from\r\nBen Harrison, on his return from the first session of the old Congress.\r\nMr. Pendleton, also, I am tolerably certain, mentioned it to me; but the\r\ntransaction is too distant, and my memory too indistinct, to hazard as\r\nwith precision, even what I think I heard from them. In this decay of\r\nmemory Mr. Edmund Randolph must have suffered at a much earlier period\r\nof life than myself. I cannot otherwise account for his saying to you\r\nthat Robert Carter Nicholas came into the Legislature only on the death\r\nof Peyton Randolph, which was in 1776. Seven years before that period, I\r\nwent first into the Legislature myself, to-wit: in 1769, and Mr. Nicholas\r\nwas then a member, and I think not a new one. I remember it from an\r\nimpressive circumstance. It was the first assembly of Lord Botetourt,\r\nbeing called on his arrival. On receiving the Governor's speech, it\r\nwas usual to move resolutions as heads for an address. Mr. Pendleton\r\nasked me to draw the resolutions, which I did. They were accepted by the\r\nhouse, and Pendleton, Nicholas, myself and some others, were appointed\r\na committee to prepare the address. The committee desired me to do it,\r\nbut when presented it was thought to pursue too strictly the diction of\r\nthe resolutions, and that their subjects were not sufficiently amplified.\r\nMr. Nicholas chiefly objected to it, and was desired by the committee to\r\ndraw one more at large, which he did with amplification enough, and it\r\nwas accepted. Being a young man as well as a young member, it made on me\r\nan impression proportioned to the sensibility of that time of life. On a\r\nsimilar occasion some years after, I had reason to retain a remembrance\r\nof his presence while Peyton Randolph was living. On the receipt of\r\nLord North's propositions, in May or June, 1775, Lord Dunmore called\r\nthe assembly. Peyton Randolph, then President of Congress and Speaker of\r\nthe House of Burgesses, left the former body and came home to hold the\r\nassembly, leaving in Congress the other delegates who were the ancient\r\nleaders of our house. He therefore asked me to prepare the answer to\r\nLord North's propositions, which I did. Mr. Nicholas, whose mind had as\r\nyet acquired no tone for that contest, combated the answer from _alpha_\r\nto _omega_, and succeeded in diluting it in one or two small instances.\r\nIt was firmly supported however, in committee of the whole, by Peyton\r\nRandolph, who had brought with him the spirit of the body over which he\r\nhad presided, and it was carried, with very little alteration, by strong\r\nmajorities. I was the bearer of it myself to Congress, by whom, as it\r\nwas the first answer given to those propositions by any legislature,\r\nit was received with peculiar satisfaction. I am sure that from 1769,\r\nif not earlier, to 1775, you will find Mr. Nicholas' name constantly\r\nin the journals, for he was an active member. I think he represented\r\nJames City county. Whether on the death of Peyton Randolph he succeeded\r\nhim for Williamsburg, I do not know. If he did, it may account for Mr.\r\nRandolph's error.\r\n\r\nYou ask some account of Mr. Henry's mind, information and manners in\r\n1759-'60, when I first became acquainted with him. We met at Nathan\r\nDandridge's, in Hanover, about the Christmas of that winter, and passed\r\nperhaps a fortnight together at the revelries of the neighborhood and\r\nseason. His manners had something of the coarseness of the society he\r\nhad frequented; his passion was fiddling, dancing and pleasantry. He\r\nexcelled in the last, and it attached every one to him. The occasion\r\nperhaps, as much as his idle disposition, prevented his engaging in\r\nany conversation which might give the measure either of his mind or\r\ninformation. Opportunity was not wanting, because Mr. John Campbell was\r\nthere, who had married Mrs. Spotswood, the sister of Colonel Dandridge.\r\nHe was a man of science, and often introduced conversations on scientific\r\nsubjects. Mr. Henry had a little before broke up his store, or rather it\r\nhad broken him up, and within three months after he came to Williamsburg\r\nfor his license, and told me, I think, he had read law not more than six\r\nweeks. I have by this time, probably, tired you with these old histories,\r\nand shall, therefore, only add the assurance of my great friendship and\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, August 10, 1815.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--The simultaneous movements in our correspondence have been\r\nremarkable on several occasions. It would seem as if the state of the\r\nair, or state of the times, or some other unknown cause, produced a\r\nsympathetic effect on our mutual recollections. I had sat down to answer\r\nyour letters of June the 19th, 20th and 22d, with pen, ink and paper\r\nbefore me, when I received from our mail that of July the 30th. You ask\r\ninformation on the subject of Camus. All I recollect of him is, that he\r\nwas one of the deputies sent to arrest Dumourier at the head of his army,\r\nwho were, however, themselves arrested by Dumourier, and long detained\r\nas prisoners. I presume, therefore, he was a Jacobin. You will find his\r\ncharacter in the most excellent revolutionary history of Toulongeon. I\r\nbelieve, also, he may be the same person who has given us a translation\r\nof Aristotle's Natural History, from the Greek into French. Of his report\r\nto the National Institute on the subject of the Bollandists, your letter\r\ngives me the first information. I had supposed them defunct with the\r\nsociety of Jesuits, of which they were; and that their works, although\r\nabove ground, were, from their bulk and insignificance, as effectually\r\nentombed on their shelves, as if in the graves of their authors. Fifty-two\r\nvolumes in folio, of the acta sanctorum, in dog-Latin, would be a\r\nformidable enterprise to the most laborious German. I expect, with you,\r\nthey are the most enormous mass of lies, frauds, hypocrisy and imposture,\r\nthat was ever heaped together on this globe. By what chemical process\r\nM. Camus supposed that an extract of truth could be obtained from such\r\na farrago of falsehood, I must leave to the chemists and moralists of\r\nthe age to divine.\r\n\r\nOn the subject of the history of the American Revolution, you ask who\r\nshall write it? Who can write it? And who will ever be able to write it?\r\nNobody; except merely its external facts; all its councils, designs and\r\ndiscussions having been conducted by Congress with closed doors, and\r\nno members, as far as I know, having even made notes of them. These,\r\nwhich are the life and soul of history, must forever be unknown. Botta,\r\nas you observe, has put his own speculations and reasonings into the\r\nmouths of persons whom he names, but who, you and I know, never made such\r\nspeeches. In this he has followed the example of the ancients, who made\r\ntheir great men deliver long speeches, all of them in the same style,\r\nand in that of the author himself. The work is nevertheless a good one,\r\nmore judicious, more chaste, more classical, and more true than the\r\nparty diatribe of Marshall. Its greatest fault is in having taken too\r\nmuch from him. I possessed the work, and often recurred to considerable\r\nportions of it, although I never read it through. But a very judicious and\r\nwell-informed neighbor of mine went through it with great attention, and\r\nspoke very highly of it. I have said that no member of the old Congress,\r\nas far as I knew, made notes of the discussion. I did not know of the\r\nspeeches you mention of Dickinson and Witherspoon. But on the questions\r\nof Independence, and on the two articles of Confederation respecting\r\ntaxes and votings, I took minutes of the heads of the arguments. On\r\nthe first, I threw all into one mass, without ascribing to the speakers\r\ntheir respective arguments; pretty much in the manner of Hume's summary\r\ndigests of the reasonings in parliament for and against a measure. On the\r\nlast, I stated the heads of the arguments used by each speaker. But the\r\nwhole of my notes on the question of Independence does not occupy more\r\nthan five pages, such as of this letter; and on the other questions, two\r\nsuch sheets. They have never been communicated to any one. Do you know\r\nthat there exists in manuscript the ablest work of this kind ever yet\r\nexecuted, of the debates of the constitutional convention of Philadelphia\r\nin 1788? The whole of everything said and done there was taken down by\r\nMr. Madison, with a labor and exactness beyond comprehension.\r\n\r\nI presume that our correspondence has been observed at the post offices,\r\nand thus has attracted notice. Would you believe, that a printer has\r\nhad the effrontery to propose to me the letting him publish it? These\r\npeople think they have a right to everything, however secret or sacred.\r\nI had not before heard of the Boston pamphlet with Priestley's letters\r\nand mine.\r\n\r\nAt length Bonaparte has got on the right side of a question. From the\r\ntime of his entering the legislative hall to his retreat to Elba, no man\r\nhas execrated him more than myself. I will not except even the members\r\nof the Essex Junto; although for very different reasons; I, because he\r\nwas warring against the liberty of his own country, and independence\r\nof others; they, because he was the enemy of England, the Pope, and the\r\nInquisition. But at length, and as far as we can judge, he seems to have\r\nbecome the choice of his nation. At least, he is defending the cause\r\nof his nation, and that of all mankind, the rights of every people to\r\nindependence and self-government. He and the allies have now changed\r\nsides. They are parcelling out among themselves Poland, Belgium, Saxony,\r\nItaly, dictating a ruler and government to France, and looking askance\r\nat our republic, the splendid libel on their governments, and he is\r\nfighting for the principles of national independence, of which his whole\r\nlife hitherto has been a continued violation. He has promised a free\r\ngovernment to his own country, and to respect the rights of others; and\r\nalthough his former conduct inspires little confidence in his promises,\r\nyet we had better take the chance of his word for doing right, than the\r\ncertainty of the wrong which his adversaries are doing and avowing. If\r\nthey succeed, ours is only the boon of the Cyclops to Ulysses, of being\r\nthe last devoured.\r\n\r\nPresent me affectionately and respectfully to Mrs. Adams, and Heaven\r\ngive you both as much more of life as you wish, and bless it with health\r\nand happiness.\r\n\r\nP. S. August the 11th.--I had finished my letter yesterday, and this\r\nmorning receive the news of Bonaparte's second abdication. Very well. For\r\nhim personally, I have no feeling but reprobation. The representatives of\r\nthe nation have deposed him. They have taken the allies at their word,\r\nthat they had no object in the war but his removal. The nation is now\r\nfree to give itself a good government, either with or without a Bourbon;\r\nand France unsubdued, will still be a bridle on the enterprises of the\r\ncombined powers, and a bulwark to others.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS TO THOMAS JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n                                                   QUINCY, August 24, 1815.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--If I am neither deceived by the little information I have,\r\nor by my wishes for its truth, I should say that France is the most\r\n_Protestant_ country of Europe at this time, though I cannot think it\r\nthe most _reformed_. In consequence of these reveries, I have imagined\r\nthat Camus and the Institute, meant, by the revival and continuance\r\nof the _Acta Sanctorum_, to destroy the Pope, and the Catholic church\r\nand Hierarchies, _de fonde en comble_, or in the language of Frederick\r\nPollair, D'Alembert, &c., \"_ecraser le miserable_\"--\"Crush the wretch.\"\r\nThis great work must contain the most complete history of the corruptions\r\nof Christianity that has ever appeared, Priestley's not excepted and\r\nhis history of ancient opinions not excepted.\r\n\r\nAs to the History of the Revolution, my ideas may be peculiar, perhaps\r\nsingular. What do we mean by the Revolution? The war? That was no part\r\nof the Revolution. It was only an effect, and consequence of it. The\r\nrevolution was in the minds of the people, and this was effected, from\r\n1760 to 1775, in the course of fifteen years, before a drop of blood was\r\ndrawn at Lexington. The records of thirteen Legislatures, the pamphlets,\r\nnewspapers, in all the colonies ought to be consulted, during that period,\r\nto ascertain the steps by which the public opinion was enlightened and\r\ninformed, concerning the authority of Parliament over the colonies. The\r\nCongress of 1774 resembled in some respects, though I hope not in many,\r\nthe council of Nice in ecclesiastical history. It assembled the Priests\r\nfrom the east and the west, the north and the south, who compared notes,\r\nengaged in discussions and debates, and formed results by one vote, and\r\nby two votes, which went out to the world as unanimous.\r\n\r\nMr. Madison's Notes of the Convention of 1787 or 1788 are consistent\r\nwith his indefatigable character. I shall never see them, but I hope\r\nposterity will.\r\n\r\nThat our correspondence has been observed is no wonder; for your hand\r\nis more universally known than your face. No printer has asked me for\r\ncopies; but it is no surprise that you have been requested. These gentry\r\nwill print whatever will sell; and our correspondence is thought such an\r\noddity by both parties, that the printers imagine an edition would soon\r\ngo off, and yield them a profit. There has, however, been no tampering\r\nwith your letters to me. They have all arrived in good order.\r\n\r\nPoor Bonaparte! Poor Devil! What has, and what will become of him? Going\r\nthe way of King Theodore, Alexander, Cæsar, Charles XIIth, Cromwell,\r\nWat Tyler, and Jack Cade, _i.e._, to a bad end. And what will become of\r\nWellington? Envied, hated, despised, by all the barons, earls, viscounts,\r\nmarquises, as an upstart, a parvenue elevated over their heads. For these\r\npeople have no idea of any merit, but birth. Wellington must pass the\r\nrest of his days buffeted, ridiculed, scorned and insulted by factions,\r\nas Marlborough and his Duchess did. Military glory dazzles the eyes of\r\nmankind, and for a time eclipses all wisdom and virtue, all laws, human\r\nand divine; and after this it would be bathos to descend to services\r\nmerely civil or political.\r\n\r\nNapoleon has imposed kings upon Spain, Holland, Sweden, Westphalia,\r\nSaxony, Naples, &c. The combined emperors and kings are about to\r\nretaliate upon France, by imposing a king upon her. These are all\r\nabominable examples, detestable precedents. When will the rights of\r\nmankind, the liberties and independence of nations, be respected? When\r\nthe perfectibility of the human mind shall arrive at perfection. When\r\nthe progress of Manillius' _Ratio_ shall have not only _eripuit cœlo\r\nfulmen, Jouvisque fulgores_, but made mankind rational creatures.\r\n\r\nIt remains to be seen whether the allies were honest in their declaration\r\nthat they were at war only with Napoleon.\r\n\r\nCan the French ever be cordially reconciled to the Bourbons again? If\r\nnot, who can they find for a head? the infant, or one of the generals?\r\nInnumerable difficulties will embarrass either project. I am, as ever\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JUDGE ROANE.\r\n\r\n                                              MONTICELLO, October 12, 1815.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I received in a letter from Colonel Monroe the enclosed paper\r\ncommunicated, as he said, with your permission, and even with a wish to\r\nknow my sentiments on the important question it discusses. It is now\r\nmore than forty years since I have ceased to be habitually conversant\r\nwith legal questions; and my pursuits through that period have seldom\r\nrequired or permitted a renewal of my former familiarity with them. My\r\nideas at present, therefore, on such questions, have no claim to respect\r\nbut such as might be yielded to the common auditors of a law argument.\r\n\r\nI well knew that in certain federal cases the laws of the United States\r\nhad given to a foreign party, whether plaintiff or defendant, a right to\r\ncarry his cause into the federal court; but I did not know that where he\r\nhad himself elected the State judicature, he could, after an unfavorable\r\ndecision there, remove his case to the federal court, and thus take the\r\nbenefit of two chances where others have but one; nor that the right of\r\nentertaining the question in this case had been exercised, or claimed\r\nby the federal judiciary after it had been postponed on the party's\r\nfirst election. His failure, too, to place on the record the particular\r\nground which might give jurisdiction to the federal court, appears to me\r\nan additional objection of great weight. The question is of the first\r\nimportance. The removal of it seems to be out of the analogies which\r\nguide the two governments on their separate tracts, and claims the solemn\r\nattention of both judicatures, and of the nation itself. I should fear to\r\nmake up a final opinion on it, until I could see as able a development of\r\nthe grounds of the federal claim as that which I have now read against\r\nit. I confess myself unable to foresee what those grounds would be. The\r\npaper enclosed must call them forth, and silence them too, unless they\r\nare beyond my ken. I am glad, therefore, that the claim is arrested, and\r\nmade the subject of special and mature deliberation. I hope our courts\r\nwill never countenance the sweeping pretensions which have been set up\r\nunder the words \"general defence and public welfare.\" These words only\r\nexpress the motives which induced the Convention to give to the ordinary\r\nlegislature certain specified powers which they enumerate, and which\r\nthey thought might be trusted to the ordinary legislature, and not to\r\ngive them the unspecified also; or why any specification? They could\r\nnot be so awkward in language as to mean, as we say, \"all and some.\" And\r\nshould this construction prevail, all limits to the federal government\r\nare done away. This opinion, formed on the first rise of the question,\r\nI have never seen reason to change, whether in or out of power; but,\r\non the contrary, find it strengthened and confirmed by five and twenty\r\nyears of additional reflection and experience: and any countenance given\r\nto it by any regular organ of the government, I should consider more\r\nominous than anything which has yet occurred.\r\n\r\nI am sensible how much these slight observations, on a question which\r\nyou have so profoundly considered, need apology. They must find this\r\nin my zeal for the administration of our government according to its\r\ntrue spirit, federal as well as republican, and in my respect for any\r\nwish which you might be supposed to entertain for opinions of so little\r\nvalue. I salute you with sincere and high respect and esteem.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CAPT. A. PARTRIDGE OF THE CORPS OF ENGINEERS, WEST POINT, NEW YORK.\r\n\r\n                                              MONTICELLO, October 12, 1815.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I thank you for the statement of altitudes, which you have been\r\nso kind as to send me of our northern mountains. It came opportunely,\r\nas I was about making inquiries for the height of the White Mountains\r\nof New Hampshire, which have the reputation of being the highest in\r\nour maritime States, and purpose shortly to measure geometrically the\r\nheight of the Peaks of Otter, which I suppose the highest _from their\r\nbase_, of any on the east side of the Mississippi, except the White\r\nMountains, and not far short of their height, if they are but of 4,885\r\nfeet. The method of estimating heights by the barometer, is convenient\r\nand useful, as being ready, and furnishing an approximation to truth. Of\r\nwhat degree of accuracy it is susceptible we know not as yet; no certain\r\ntheory being established for ascertaining the density and weight of that\r\nportion of the column of atmosphere contiguous to the mountain; from\r\nthe weight of which, nevertheless, we are to infer the height of the\r\nmountain. The most plausible seems to be that which supposes the mercury\r\nof barometer divided into horizontal lamina of equal _thickness_; and\r\na similar column of the atmosphere into lamina of equal _weights_. The\r\nformer divisions give a set of arithmetical, the latter of geometrical\r\nprogressionals, which being the character of Logarithms and their numbers,\r\nthe tables of these furnish ready computations, needing, however, the\r\ncorrections which the state of the thermometer calls for. It is probable\r\nthat in taking heights in the vicinity of each other in this way, there\r\nmay be no considerable error, because the passage between them may be\r\nquick and repeated. The height of a mountain from its base, thus taken,\r\nmerits, therefore, a very different degree of credit from that of its\r\nheight above the level of the sea, where that is distant. According,\r\nfor example, to the theory above mentioned, the height of Monticello\r\nfrom its base is 580 feet, and its base 610 feet 8 inches, above the\r\nlevel of the ocean; the former, from other facts, I judge to be near the\r\ntruth; but a knowledge of the different falls of water from hence to the\r\ntide-water at Richmond, a distance of seventy-five miles, enables us to\r\nsay that the whole descent to that place is but 170 or 180 feet. From\r\nthence to the ocean may be a distance of one hundred miles; it is all\r\ntide-water, and through a level country. I know not what to conjecture as\r\nthe amount of descent, but certainly not 435 feet, as that theory would\r\nsuppose, nor the quarter part of it. I do not know by what rule General\r\nWilliams made his computations; he reckons the foot of the Blue Ridge,\r\ntwenty miles from here, but 100 feet above the tide-water at Richmond.\r\nWe know the descent, as before observed, to be at least 170 feet from\r\nhence, to which is to be added that from the Blue Ridge to this place,\r\na very hilly country, with constant and great waterfalls. His estimate,\r\ntherefore, must be much below truth. Results so different prove that\r\nfor distant comparisons of height, the barometer is not to be relied\r\non according to any theory yet known. While, therefore, we give a good\r\ndegree of credit to the results of operations between the summit of a\r\nmountain and its base, we must give less to those between its summit\r\nand the level of the ocean.\r\n\r\nI will do myself the pleasure of sending you my estimate of the Peaks\r\nof Otter, which I count on undertaking in the course of the next month.\r\nIn the meantime accept the assurance of my great respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DOCTOR LOGAN.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, October 15,1815.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I thank you for the extract in yours of August 16th respecting\r\nthe Emperor Alexander. It arrived here a day or two after I had left this\r\nplace, from which I have been absent seven or eight weeks. I had from\r\nother information formed the most favorable opinion of the virtues of\r\nAlexander, and considered his partiality to this country as a prominent\r\nproof of them. The magnanimity of his conduct on the first capture of\r\nParis still magnified everything we had believed of him; but how he will\r\ncome out of his present trial remains to be seen. That the sufferings\r\nwhich France had inflicted on other countries justified severe reprisals,\r\ncannot be questioned; but I have not yet learned what crimes of Poland,\r\nSaxony, Belgium, Venice, Lombardy and Genoa, had merited for them, not\r\nmerely a temporary punishment, but that of permanent subjugation and a\r\ndestitution of independence and self-government. The fable of Æsop of\r\nthe lion dividing the spoils, is, I fear, becoming true history, and\r\nthe moral code of Napoleon and the English government a substitute for\r\nthat of Grotius, of Puffendorf, and even of the pure doctrine of the\r\ngreat author of our own religion. We were safe ourselves from Bonaparte,\r\nbecause he had not the British fleets at his command. We were safe from\r\nthe British fleets, because they had Bonaparte at their back; but the\r\nBritish fleets and the conquerors of Bonaparte being now combined, and\r\nthe Hartford nation drawn off to them, we have uncommon reason to look\r\nto our own affairs. This, however, I leave to others, offering prayers to\r\nheaven, the only contribution of old age, for the safety of our country.\r\nBe so good as to present me affectionately to Mrs. Logan, and to accept\r\nyourself the assurance of my esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GALLATIN.\r\n\r\n                                              MONTICELLO, October 16, 1815.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--A long absence from home must apologize for my so late\r\nacknowledgment of your welcome favor of September 6th. Our storm of the\r\n4th of that month gave me great uneasiness for you; for I was certain\r\nyou must be on the coast, and your actual arrival was unknown to me.\r\nIt was such a wind as I have not witnessed since the year 1769. It did,\r\nhowever, little damage with us, only prostrating our corn, and tearing\r\ntobacco, without essential injury to either. It could have been nothing\r\ncompared with that of the 23d, off the coast of New England, of which we\r\nhad not a breath, but on the contrary, fine, fair weather. Is this the\r\njudgment of God between us? I congratulate you sincerely on your safe\r\nreturn to your own country, and without knowing your own wishes, mine\r\nare that you would never leave it again. I know you would be useful to\r\nus at Paris, and so you would anywhere; but nowhere so useful as here.\r\nWe are undone, my dear Sir, if this banking mania be not suppressed.\r\n_Aut Carthago, aut Roma delenda est._ The war, had it proceeded, would\r\nhave upset our government; and a new one, whenever tried, will do\r\nit. And so it must be while our money, the nerve of war, is much or\r\nlittle, real or imaginary, as our bitterest enemies choose to make it.\r\nPut down the banks, and if this country could not be carried through\r\nthe longest war against her most powerful enemy, without ever knowing\r\nthe want of a dollar, without dependence on the traitorous classes of\r\nher citizens, without bearing hard on the resources of the people, or\r\nloading the public with an indefinite burthen of debt, I know nothing\r\nof my countrymen. Not by any novel project, not by any charlatanerie,\r\nbut by ordinary and well-experienced means; by the total prohibition of\r\nall private paper at all times, by reasonable taxes in war aided by the\r\nnecessary emissions of public paper of circulating size, this bottomed\r\non special taxes, redeemable annually as this special tax comes in, and\r\nfinally within a moderate period,--even with the flood of private paper\r\nby which we were deluged, would the treasury have ventured its credit in\r\nbills of circulating size, as of five or ten dollars, &c., they would\r\nhave been greedily received by the people in preference to bank paper.\r\nBut unhappily the towns of America were considered as the nation of\r\nAmerica, the dispositions of the inhabitants of the former as those of\r\nthe latter, and the treasury, for want of confidence in the country,\r\ndelivered itself bound hand and foot to bold and bankrupt adventurers\r\nand pretenders to be money-holders, whom it could have crushed at any\r\nmoment. Even the last half-bold half-timid threat of the treasury, showed\r\nat once that these jugglers were at the feet of government. For it never\r\nwas, and is not, any confidence in their frothy bubbles, but the want of\r\nall other medium, which induced, or now induces, the _country_ people to\r\ntake their paper; and at this moment, when nothing else is to be had,\r\nno man will receive it but to pass it away instantly, none for distant\r\npurposes. We are now without any common measure of the value of property,\r\nand private fortunes are up or down at the will of the worst of our\r\ncitizens. Yet there is no hope of relief from the legislatures who have\r\nimmediate control over this subject. As little seems to be known of the\r\nprinciples of political economy as if nothing had ever been written or\r\npractised on the subject, or as was known in old times, when the Jews\r\nhad their rulers under the hammer. It is an evil, therefore, which we\r\nmust make up our minds to meet and to endure as those of hurricanes,\r\nearthquakes and other casualties: let us turn over therefore another leaf.\r\n\r\nI grieve for France; although it cannot be denied that by the afflictions\r\nwith which she wantonly and wickedly overwhelmed other nations, she has\r\nmerited severe reprisals. For it is no excuse to lay the enormities to\r\nthe wretch who led to them, and who has been the author of more misery\r\nand suffering to the world, than any being who ever lived before him.\r\nAfter destroying the liberties of his country, he has exhausted all its\r\nresources, physical and moral, to indulge his own maniac ambition, his\r\nown tyrannical and overbearing spirit. His sufferings cannot be too great.\r\nBut theirs I sincerely deplore, and what is to be their term? The will of\r\nthe allies? There is no more moderation, forbearance, or even honesty in\r\ntheirs, than in that of Bonaparte. They have proved that their object,\r\nlike his, is plunder. They, like him, are shuffling nations together,\r\nor into their own hands, as if all were right which they feel a power\r\nto do. In the exhausted state in which Bonaparte has left France, I\r\nsee no period to her sufferings, until this combination of robbers fall\r\ntogether by the ears. The French may then rise up and choose their side.\r\nAnd I trust they will finally establish for themselves a government of\r\nrational and well-tempered liberty. So much science cannot be lost; so\r\nmuch light shed over them can never fail to produce to them some good,\r\nin the end. Till then we may ourselves fervently pray, with the liturgy\r\na little parodied, \"Give peace till that time, oh Lord, because there\r\nis none other that will fight for us but only thee, oh God.\" It is rare\r\nthat I indulge in these poetical effusions; but your former and latter\r\nrelations with both subjects have associated you with them in my mind,\r\nand led me beyond the limits of attention I ordinarily give to them.\r\nWhether you go or stay with us, you have always the prayers of yours\r\naffectionately.\r\n\r\nP. S. The two letters you enclosed me were from Warden and De Lormerie,\r\nand neither from La Fayette, as you supposed.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS TO THOMAS JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n                                                 QUINCY, November 13, 1815.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--The fundamental article of my political creed is, that\r\ndespotism, or unlimited sovereignty, or absolute power, is the same in a\r\nmajority of a popular assembly, an aristocratical council, an oligarchical\r\njunto, and a single emperor; equally arbitrary, cruel, bloody, and in\r\nevery respect diabolical.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, arbitrary power, wherever it has resided, ha never failed\r\nto destroy all the records, memorials, and histories of former times\r\nwhich it did not like, and to corrupt and interpolate such as it was\r\ncunning enough to preserve or tolerate. We cannot therefore say with\r\nmuch confidence, what knowledge or what virtues may have prevailed in\r\nsome former ages in some quarters of the world.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, according to the few lights that remain to us, we may say\r\nthat the eighteenth century, notwithstanding all its errors and vices,\r\nhas been, of all that are past, the most honorable to human nature.\r\nKnowledge and virtues were increased and diffused. Arts, sciences useful\r\nto men, ameliorating their condition, were improved more than in any\r\nformer equal period.\r\n\r\nBut what are we to say now? Is the nineteenth century to be a contrast to\r\nthe eighteenth? Is it to extinguish all the lights of its predecessors?\r\nAre the Sorbonne, the Inquisition, the Index Expurgatorius, and the\r\nknights-errant of St. Ignatius Loyola to be revived and restored to all\r\ntheir salutary powers of supporting and propagating the mild spirit of\r\nChristianity? The proceedings of the allies and their Congress at Vienna,\r\nthe accounts from Spain, France, &c., the Chateaubriands and the Genti's,\r\nindicate which way the wind blows. The priests are at their old work\r\nagain. The Protestants are denounced, and another St. Bartholomew's day\r\nthreatened.\r\n\r\nThis, however, will probably, twenty-five years hence, be honored with\r\nthe character of \"_The effusions of a splenetic mind, rather than as the\r\nsober reflections of an unbiased understanding_.\" I have received Memoirs\r\nof the Life of Dr. Price, by William Morgan, F.R.S. In pages 151 and 155\r\nMr. Morgan says: \"So well assured was Dr. Price of the establishment\r\nof a free constitution in France, and of the subsequent overthrow of\r\ndespotism throughout Europe, as the consequence of it, that he never\r\nfailed to express his gratitude to heaven for having extended his life\r\nto the present happy period, in which after sharing the benefits of one\r\nrevolution, he has been spared to be a witness to two other revolutions,\r\nboth glorious.\" But some of his correspondents were not quite so sanguine\r\nin their expectations from the last of the revolutions; and among these,\r\nthe late American Ambassador, Mr. John Adams. In a long letter which he\r\nwrote to Dr. Price at this time, so far from congratulating him on the\r\noccasion, he expresses himself in terms of contempt, in regard to the\r\nFrench revolution; and after asking rather too severely what good was\r\nto be expected from a nation of Atheists, he concluded with foretelling\r\nthe destruction of a million of human beings as the probable consequence\r\nof it. These harsh censures and gloomy predictions were particularly\r\nungrateful to Dr. Price, nor can it be denied that they must have then\r\nappeared as the _effusions of a splenetic mind, rather than as the sober\r\nreflections_ of an unbiased understanding.\r\n\r\nI know not what a candid public will think of this practice of Mr.\r\nMorgan, after the example of Mr. Belsham, who, finding private letters\r\nin the Cabinet of a great and good man, after his decease, written in\r\nthe utmost freedom and confidence of intimate friendship, by persons\r\nstill living, though after the lapse of a quarter of a century, produces\r\nthem before the world.\r\n\r\nDr. Disney had different feelings and a different judgment. Finding some\r\ncursory letters among the papers of Mr. Hollis, he would not publish\r\nthem without my consent. In answer to his request, I submitted them to\r\nhis discretion, and might have done the same to Mr. Morgan; indeed, had\r\nMr. Morgan published my letter entire, I should not have given him nor\r\nmyself any concern about it. But as in his summary he has not done the\r\nlatter justice, I shall give it with all its faults.\r\n\r\nMr. Morgan has been more discreet and complaisant to you than to me. He\r\nhas mentioned respectfully your letters from Paris to Dr. Price, but has\r\ngiven us none of them. As I would give more for these letters than for\r\nall the rest of the book, I am more angry with him for disappointing\r\nme, than for all he says of me and my letter, which, scambling as it\r\nis, contains nothing but the sure words of prophecy. I am, as usual, yours\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. WM. BENTLEY.\r\n\r\n                                             MONTICELLO, December 28, 1815.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--At the date of your letter of October 30th, I had just left\r\nhome on a journey from which I am recently returned. I had many years\r\nago understood that Professor Ebeling was engaged in a geographical\r\nwork which would comprehend the United States, and indeed I expected\r\nit was finished and published. I am glad to learn that his candor and\r\ndiscrimination have been sufficient to guard him against trusting the\r\nlibel of Dr. Morse on this State. I wish it were in my power to give him\r\nthe aid you ask, but it is not. The whole forenoon with me is engrossed\r\nby correspondence too extensive and laborious for my age. Health, habit,\r\nand necessary attention to my farms, require me then to be on horseback\r\nuntil a late dinner, and the society of my family and friends, with some\r\nreading, furnish the necessary relaxations of the rest of the day. Add\r\nto this that the cession of my library to Congress has left me without\r\nmaterials for such an undertaking. I wish the part of his work which\r\ngives the geography of this country may be translated and published, that\r\nourselves and the world may at length have something like a dispassionate\r\naccount of these States. Poor human nature! when we are obliged to appeal\r\nfor the truth of mere facts from an eye-witness to one whose faculties\r\nfor discovering it are only an honest candor and caution in sifting the\r\ngrain from its chaff!\r\n\r\nThe Professor's history of Hamburg is doubtless interesting and\r\ninstructive, and valuable as a corrective of the false information\r\nwe derive from newspapers. I should read it with pleasure, but I\r\nfear its transportation and return would expose it to too much risk.\r\nNotwithstanding all the French and British atrocities, which will forever\r\ndisgrace the present era of history, their shameless prostration of all\r\nthe laws of morality which constitute the security, the peace and comfort\r\nof man--notwithstanding the waste of human life, and measure of human\r\nsuffering which they have inflicted on the world--nations hitherto in\r\nslavery have descried through all this bloody mist a glimmering of their\r\nown rights, have dared to open their eyes, and to see that their own\r\npower and their own will suffice for their emancipation. Their tyrants\r\nmust now give them more moderate forms of government, and they seem now\r\nto be sensible of this themselves. Instead of the parricide treason\r\nof Bonaparte in employing the means confided to him as a republican\r\nmagistrate to the overthrow of that republic, and establishment of a\r\nmilitary despotism in himself and his descendants, to the subversion of\r\nthe neighboring governments, and erection of thrones for his brothers,\r\nhis sisters and sycophants, had he honestly employed that power in\r\nthe establishment and support of the freedom of his own country, there\r\nis not a nation in Europe which would not at this day have had a more\r\nrational government, one in which the will of the people should have had\r\na moderating and salutary influence. The work will now be longer, will\r\nswell more rivers with blood, produce more sufferings and more crimes.\r\nBut it will be consummated; and that it may be will be the theme of\r\nmy constant prayers while I shall remain on the earth beneath, or in\r\nthe heavens above. To these I add sincere wishes for your health and\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GEORGE FLEMING.\r\n\r\n                                             MONTICELLO, December 29, 1815.\r\n\r\nSIR,--At the date of your favor of October 30th, I had just left home on\r\na journey to a distant possession of mine, from which I am but recently\r\nreturned, and I wish that the matter of my answer could compensate for\r\nits delay. But, Sir, it happens that of all the machines which have been\r\nemployed to aid human labor, I have made myself the least acquainted with\r\n(that which is certainly the most powerful of all) the steam engine. In\r\nits original and simple form indeed, as first constructed by Newcomen and\r\nSavary, it had been a subject of my early studies; but once possessed of\r\nthe principle, I ceased to follow up the numerous modifications of the\r\nmachinery for employing it, of which I do not know whether England or\r\nour own country has produced the greatest number. Hence, I am entirely\r\nincompetent to form a judgment of the comparative merit of yours with\r\nthose preceding it; and the cession of my library to Congress has left me\r\nwithout any examples to turn to. I see, indeed, in yours, the valuable\r\nproperties of simplicity, cheapness and accommodation to the small and\r\nmore numerous calls of life, and the calculations of its power appear\r\nsound and correct. Yet experience and frequent disappointment have taught\r\nme not to be over-confident in theories or calculations, until actual\r\ntrial of the whole combination has stamped it with approbation. Should\r\nthis sanction be added, the importance of your construction will be\r\nenhanced by the consideration that a smaller agent, applicable to our\r\ndaily concerns, is infinitely more valuable than the greatest which can\r\nbe used only for great objects. For these interest the few alone, the\r\nformer the many. I once had an idea that it might perhaps be possible\r\nto economize the steam of a common pot, kept boiling on the kitchen\r\nfire until its accumulation should be sufficient to give a stroke, and\r\nalthough the strokes might not be rapid, there would be enough of them\r\nin the day to raise from an adjacent well the water necessary for daily\r\nuse; to wash the linen, knead the bread, beat the homony, churn the\r\nbutter, turn the spit, and do all other household offices which require\r\nonly a regular mechanical motion. The unproductive hands now necessarily\r\nemployed in these, might then increase the produce of our fields. I\r\nproposed it to Mr. Rumsey, one of our greatest mechanics, who believed\r\nin its possibility, and promised to turn his mind to it. But his death\r\nsoon after disappointed this hope. Of how much more value would this be\r\nto ordinary life than Watts & Bolton's thirty pair of mill-stones to be\r\nturned by one engine, of which I saw seven pair in actual operation. It\r\nis an interesting part of your question, how much fuel would be requisite\r\nfor your machine?\r\n\r\nYour letter being evidence of your attention to mechanical things, and to\r\ntheir application to matters of daily interest, I will mention a trifle\r\nin this way, which yet is not without value. I presume, like the rest of\r\nus in the country, you are in the habit of household manufacture, and\r\nthat you will not, like too many, abandon it on the return of peace,\r\nto enrich our late enemy, and to nourish foreign agents in our bosom,\r\nwhose baneful influence and intrigues cost us so much embarrassment and\r\ndissension. The shirting for our laborers has been an object of some\r\ndifficulty. Flax is injurious to our lands, and of so scanty produce\r\nthat I have never attempted it. Hemp, on the other hand, is abundantly\r\nproductive, and will grow forever on the same spot. But the breaking and\r\nbeating it, which has been always done by hand, is so slow, so laborious,\r\nand so much complained of by our laborers, that I had given it up and\r\npurchased and manufactured cotton for their shirting. The advanced\r\nprice of this, however, now makes it a serious item of expense; and\r\nin the meantime, a method of removing the difficulty of preparing hemp\r\noccurred to me, so simple and so cheap, that I return to its culture and\r\nmanufacture. To a person having a threshing machine, the addition of a\r\nhemp-break will not cost more than twelve or fifteen dollars. You know\r\nthat the first mover in that machine is a horizontal horse-wheel with\r\ncogs on its upper face. On these is placed a wallower and shaft, which\r\ngive motion to the threshing apparatus. On the opposite side of this\r\nsame wheel I place another wallower and shaft, through which, and near\r\nits outer end, I pass a cross-arm of sufficient strength, projecting on\r\neach side fifteen inches in this form: [Illustration] nearly under the\r\ncross-arm is placed a very strong hemp-break, much stronger and heavier\r\nthan those for the hand. Its head block particularly is massive, and four\r\nfeet high, and near its upper end in front, is fixed a strong pin (which\r\nwe may call its horn), by this the cross-arm lifts and lets fall the\r\nbreak twice in every revolution of the wallower. A man feeds the break\r\nwith hemp stalks, and a little person holds under the head block a large\r\ntwist of the hemp which has been broken, resembling a twist of tobacco\r\nbut larger, where it is more perfectly beaten than I have ever seen done\r\nby hand. If the horse-wheel has one hundred and forty-four cogs, the\r\nwallower eleven rounds, and the horse goes three times round in a minute,\r\nit will give about eighty strokes in a minute. I had fixed a break to be\r\nmoved by the gate of my saw-mill, which broke and beat at the rate of\r\ntwo hundred pounds a day. But the inconveniences of interrupting that,\r\ninduced me to try the power of a horse, and I have found it to answer\r\nperfectly. The power being less, so also probably will be the effect,\r\nof which I cannot make a fair trial until I commence on my new crop.\r\nI expect that a single horse will do the breaking and beating of ten\r\nmen. Something of this kind has been so long wanted by the cultivators\r\nof hemp, that as soon as I can speak of its effect with certainty, I\r\nshall probably describe it anonymously in the public papers, in order\r\nto forestall the prevention of its use by some interloping patentee. I\r\nshall be happy to learn that an actual experiment of your steam engine\r\nfulfils the expectations we form of it, and I pray you to accept the\r\nassurances of my esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. DUPONT DE NEMOURS.\r\n\r\n                                             MONTICELLO, December 31, 1815.\r\n\r\nNothing, my very dear and ancient friend, could have equalled the\r\nmortification I felt on my arrival at home, and receipt of the information\r\nthat I had lost the happiness of your visit. The season had so far\r\nadvanced, and the weather become so severe, that together with the\r\ninformation given me by Mr. Correa, so early as September, that your\r\nfriends even then were dissuading the journey, I had set it down as\r\ncertain it would be postponed to a milder season of the ensuing year.\r\nI had yielded, therefore, with the less reluctance to a detention in\r\nBedford by a slower progress of my workmen than had been counted on. I\r\nhave never more desired anything than a full and free conversation with\r\nyou. I have not understood the transactions in France during the years\r\n'14 and '15. From the newspapers we cannot even conjecture the secret\r\nand real history; and I had looked for it to your visit. A pamphlet\r\n(_Le Conciliateur_) received from M. Jullien, had given me some idea\r\nof the obliquities and imbecilities of the Bourbons, during their first\r\nrestoration. Some manœuvres of both parties I had learnt from Lafayette,\r\nand more recently from Gallatin. But the note you referred me to at page\r\n360 of your letter to Say, has possessed me more intimately of the views,\r\nthe conduct and consequences of the last apparition of Napoleon. Still\r\nmuch is wanting. I wish to know what were the intrigues which brought\r\nhim back, and what those which finally crushed him? What parts were acted\r\nby A, B, C, D., &c, some of whom I know, and some I do not? How did the\r\nbody of the nation stand affectioned, comparatively, between the fool\r\nand the tyrant? &c., &c., &c. From the account my family gives me of\r\nyour sound health, and of the vivacity and vigor of your mind, I will\r\nstill hope we shall meet again, and that the fine temperature of our\r\nearly summer, to wit, of May and June, may suggest to you the salutary\r\neffects of exercise, and change of air and scene. _En attendant_, we\r\nwill turn to other subjects.\r\n\r\nThat your opinion of the hostile intentions of Great Britain towards us\r\nis sound, I am satisfied, from her movements north and south of us, as\r\nwell as from her temper. She feels the gloriole of her late _golden_\r\nachievements tarnished by our successes against her by sea and land;\r\nand will not be contented until she has wiped it off by triumphs over us\r\nalso. I rely, however, on the volcanic state of Europe to present other\r\nobjects for her arms and her apprehensions; and am not without hope we\r\nshall be permitted to proceed peaceably in making children, and maturing\r\nand moulding our strength and resources. It is impossible that France\r\nshould rest under her present oppressions and humiliations. She will\r\nrise in that gigantic strength which cannot be annihilated, and will\r\nfatten her fields with the blood of her enemies. I only wish she may\r\nexercise patience and forbearance until divisions among them may give\r\nher a choice of sides. To the overwhelming power of England I see but\r\ntwo chances of limit. The first is her bankruptcy, which will deprive\r\nher of the _golden_ instrument of all her successes. The other in that\r\nascendency which nature destines for us by immutable laws. But to hasten\r\nthis last consummation, we too must exercise patience and forbearance.\r\nFor twenty years to come we should consider peace as the _summum bonum_\r\nof our country. At the end of that period we shall be twenty millions in\r\nnumber, and forty in energy, when encountering the starved and rickety\r\npaupers and dwarfs of English workshops. By that time I hope your grandson\r\nwill have become one of our High-admirals, and bear distinguished part\r\nin retorting the wrongs of both his countries on the most implacable\r\nand cruel of their enemies. In this hope, and because I love you, and\r\nall who are dear to you, I wrote to the President in the instant of\r\nreading your letter of the 7th, on the subject of his adoption into\r\nour navy. I did it because I was gratified in doing it, while I knew it\r\nwas unnecessary. The sincere respect and high estimation in which the\r\nPresident holds you, is such that there is no gratification, within the\r\nregular exercise of his functions, which he would withhold from you. Be\r\nassured then that, if within that compass, this business is safe.\r\n\r\nWere you any other than whom you are, I should shrink from the task you\r\nhave proposed to me, of undertaking to judge of the merit of your own\r\ntranslation of the excellent letter on education. After having done all\r\nwhich good sense and eloquence could do on the original, you must not\r\nambition the double need of English eloquence also. Did you ever know an\r\ninstance of one who could write in a foreign language with the elegance\r\nof a native? Cicero wrote Commentaries of his own Consulship in Greek;\r\nthey perished unknown, while his native compositions have immortalized\r\nhim with themselves. No, my dear friend; you must not risk the success\r\nof your letter on foreignisms of style which may weaken its effect. Some\r\nnative pen must give it to our countrymen in a native dress, faithful\r\nto its original. You will find such with the aid of our friend Correa,\r\nwho knows everybody, and will readily think of some one who has time and\r\ntalent for this work. I have neither. Till noon I am daily engaged in a\r\ncorrespondence much too extensive and laborious for my age. From noon to\r\ndinner health, habit, and business, require me to be on horseback; and\r\nrender the society of my family and friends a necessary relaxation for\r\nthe rest of the day. These occupations scarcely leave time for the papers\r\nof the day; and to renounce entirely the sciences and belles-lettres is\r\nimpossible. Had not Mr. Gilmer just taken his place in the ranks of the\r\nbar, I think we could have engaged him in this work. But I am persuaded\r\nthat Mr. Correa's intimacy with the persons of promise in our country,\r\nwill leave you without difficulty in laying this work of instruction\r\nopen to our citizens at large.\r\n\r\nI have not yet had time to read your Equinoctial republics, nor the\r\nletter of Say; because I am still engrossed by the letters which had\r\naccumulated during my absence. The latter I accept with thankfulness, and\r\nwill speedily read and return the former. God bless you, and maintain\r\nyou in strength of body, and mind, until your own wishes shall be to\r\nresign both.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CAPT. A. PARTRIDGE.\r\n\r\n                                              MONTICELLO, January 2d, 1816.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I am but recently returned from my journey to the neighborhood of\r\nthe Peaks of Otter, and find here your favors of November 23d and December\r\n9th. I have therefore to thank you for your meteorological table and the\r\ncorrections of Colonel Williams' altitudes of the mountains of Virginia,\r\nwhich I had not before seen; but especially for the very able extract on\r\nBarometrical measures. The precision of the calculations, and soundness\r\nof the principles on which they are founded, furnish, I am satisfied, a\r\ngreat approximation towards truth, and raise that method of estimating\r\nheights to a considerable degree of rivalship with the trigonometrical.\r\nThe last is not without some sources of inaccuracy, as you have truly\r\nstated. The admeasurement of the base is liable to errors which can be\r\nrendered insensible only by such degrees of care as have been exhibited\r\nby the mathematicians who have been employed in measuring degrees on\r\nthe surface of the earth. The measure of the angles by the wonderful\r\nperfection to which the graduation of instruments has been brought by\r\na Bird, a Ramsden, a Troughton, removes nearly all distrust from that\r\noperation; and we may add that the effect of refraction, rarely worth\r\nnotice in short distances, admits of correction by well-established laws;\r\nthese sources of error once reduced to be insensible, their geometrical\r\nemployment is certainty itself. No two men can differ on a principle of\r\ntrigonometry. Not so as to the theories of Barometrical mensuration. On\r\nthese have been great differences of opinion, and among characters of\r\njust celebrity.\r\n\r\nDr. Halley reckoned one-tenth inch of Mercury equal to 90 feet altitude\r\nof the atmosphere. Derham thought it equal to something less than 90\r\nfeet. Cassini's tables to 24° of the Barometer allowed 676 toises of\r\naltitudes.\r\n\r\n     Mariole's, to the same    544 toises.\r\n     Schruchzer's   \"          559    \"\r\n\r\nNettleton's tables applied to a difference of .5975 of mercury, in a\r\nparticular instance gave 512.17 feet of altitude, and Bonguor's and De\r\nLuc's rules, to the same difference gave 579.5 feet. Sir Isaac Newton\r\nhad established that at heights in arithmetrical progression the ratio\r\nof rarity in the air would be geometrical, and this being the character\r\nof the natural numbers and their Logarithms, Bonguor adopted the ratio\r\nin his mensuration of the mountains of South America, and stating in\r\nFrench lignes the height of the mercury of different stations, took their\r\nLogarithms to five places only, including the index, and considered the\r\nresulting difference as expressing that of the altitudes in French toises.\r\nHe then applied corrections required by the effect of the temperature\r\nof the moment on the air and mercury. His process, on the whole, agrees\r\nvery exactly with that established in your excellent extract. In 1776\r\nI observed the height of the mercury at the base and summit of the\r\nmountain I live on, and by Nettleton's tables, estimated the height at\r\n512.17 feet, and called it about 500 feet in the Notes on Virginia. But\r\ncalculating it since on the same observations, according to Bonguor's\r\nmethod with De Luc's improvements, the result was 579.5 feet; and lately\r\nI measured the same height trigonometrically, with the aid of a base\r\nof 1,175 feet in a vertical plane with the summit, and at the distance\r\nof about 1,500 yards from the axis of the mountain, and made it 599.35\r\nfeet. I consider this as testing the advance of the barometrical process\r\ntowards truth by the adoption of the Logarithmic ratio of heights and\r\ndensities; and continued observations and experiments will continue to\r\nadvance it still more. But the first character of a common measure of\r\nthings being that of invariability, I can never suppose that a substance\r\nso heterogeneous and variable as the atmospheric fluid, changing daily and\r\nhourly its weight and dimensions to the amount, sometimes, of one-tenth\r\nof the whole, can be applied as a standard of measure to anything, with\r\nas much mathematical exactness, as a trigonometrical process. It is\r\nstill, however, a resource of great value for these purposes, because\r\nits use is so easy, in comparison with the other, and especially where\r\nthe grounds are unfavorable for a base; and its results are so near the\r\ntruth as to answer all the common purposes of information. Indeed, I\r\nshould in all cases prefer the use of both, to warn us against gross\r\nerror, and to put us, when that is suspected, on a repetition of our\r\nprocess. When lately measuring trigonometrically the height of the Peaks\r\nof Otter (as my letter of October 12th informed you I was about to do),\r\nI very much wished for a barometer, to try the height of that also. But\r\nit was too far and hazardous to carry my own, and there was not one in\r\nthat neighborhood. On the subject of that admeasurement, I must premise\r\nthat my object was only to gratify a common curiosity as to the height\r\nof those mountains, which we deem our highest, and to furnish an _à\r\npeu près_, sufficient to satisfy us in a comparison of them with the\r\nother mountains of our own, or of other countries. I therefore neither\r\nprovided such instruments, nor aimed at such extraordinary accuracy in\r\nthe measures of my base, as abler operators would have employed in the\r\nmore important object of measuring a degree, or of ascertaining the\r\nrelative position of different places for astronomical or geographical\r\npurposes. My instrument was a theodolite by Ramsden, whose horizontal\r\nand vertical circles were of 3½ inches radius, its graduation subdivided\r\nby noniuses to one-third, admitting however by its intervals, a further\r\nsubdivision by the eye to a single minute, with two telescopes, the one\r\nfixed, the other movable, and a Gunter's chain of four poles, accurately\r\nadjusted in its length, and carefully attended on its application to the\r\nbase line. The Sharp, or southern peak, was first measured by a base of\r\n2806.32 feet in the vertical plane of the axis of the mountain. A base\r\nthen nearly parallel with the two mountains of 6,589 feet was measured,\r\nand observations taken at each end, of the altitudes and horizontal\r\nangles of each apex, and such other auxiliary observations made as to the\r\nstations, inclination of the base, &c., as a good degree of correctness\r\nin the result would require. The ground of our bases was favorable,\r\nbeing an open plain of close grazed meadow on both sides of the Otter\r\nriver, declining so uniformly with the descent of the river as to give no\r\nother trouble than an observation of its angle of inclination, in order\r\nto reduce the base to the plane of the horizon. From the summit of the\r\nSharp peak I took also the angle of altitude of the flat or northern one\r\nabove it, my other observations sufficing to give their distance from\r\none another. The result was, the mean height of the Sharp peak above\r\nthe surface of Otter river\r\n\r\n                                                         2946.5 inches.\r\n     Mean height of the flat peak above the surface of Otter\r\n     river                                               3103.5 inches.\r\n\r\n     The distance between the two summits               9507.73 inches.\r\n\r\nTheir rhumb N. 33° 50´ E. the distance of the stations of observation\r\nfrom the points in the bases of the mountains vertically under their\r\nsummits was, the shortest 19002.2 feet, the longest 24523.3 feet. These\r\nmountains are computed to be visible to fifteen counties of the State,\r\nwithout the advantage of counter-elevations, and to several more with\r\nthat advantage. I must add that I have gone over my calculations but\r\nonce, and nothing is more possible than the mistake of a figure, now\r\nand then, in calculating so many triangles, which may occasion some\r\nvariation in the result. I mean, therefore, when I have leisure, to go\r\nagain over the whole. The ridge of mountains of which Monticello is one,\r\nis generally low; there is one in it, however, called Peter's mountain,\r\nconsiderably higher than the general ridge. This being within a dozen\r\nmiles of me, north-eastwardly, I think in the spring of the year to\r\nmeasure it by both processes, which may serve as another trial of the\r\nLogarithmic theory. Should I do this you shall know the result. In the\r\nmeantime accept assurances of my great respect and esteem.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL YANCEY.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, January 6, 1816.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I am favored with yours of December 24th, and perceive you\r\nhave many matters before you of great moment. I have no fear but that\r\nthe legislature will do on all of them what is wise and just. On the\r\nparticular subject of our river, in the navigation of which our county\r\nhas so great an interest, I think the power of permitting dams to be\r\nerected across it, ought to be taken from the courts, so far as the\r\nstream has water enough for navigation. The value of our property is\r\nsensibly lessened by the dam which the court of Fluvana authorized not\r\nlong since to be erected, but a little above its mouth. This power over\r\nthe value and convenience of our lands is of much too high a character\r\nto be placed at the will of a county court, and that of a county, too,\r\nwhich has not a common interest in the preservation of the navigation\r\nfor those above them. As to the existing dams, if any conditions are\r\nproposed more than those to which they were subjected on their original\r\nerection, I think they would be allowed the alternative of opening a\r\nsluice for the passage of navigation, so as to put the river into as\r\ngood a condition for navigation as it was before the erection of their\r\ndam, or as it would be if their dam were away. Those interested in the\r\nnavigation might then use the sluices or make locks as should be thought\r\nbest. Nature and reason, as well as all our constitutions, condemn\r\nretrospective conditions as mere acts of power against right.\r\n\r\nI recommend to your patronage our Central College. I look to it as a\r\ngerm from which a great tree may spread itself.\r\n\r\nThere is before the assembly a petition of a Captain Miller which I have\r\nat heart, because I have great esteem for the petitioner as an honest\r\nand useful man. He is about to settle in our county, and to establish\r\na brewery, in which art I think him as skilful a man as has ever come\r\nto America. I wish to see this beverage become common instead of the\r\nwhiskey which kills one-third of our citizens and ruins their families.\r\nHe is staying with me until he can fix himself, and I should be thankful\r\nfor information from time to time of the progress of his petition.\r\n\r\nLike a dropsical man calling out for water, water, our deluded citizens\r\nare clamoring for more banks, more banks. The American mind is now in\r\nthat state of fever which the world has so often seen in the history\r\nof other nations. We are under the bank bubble, as England was under\r\nthe South Sea bubble, France under the Mississippi bubble, and as every\r\nnation is liable to be, under whatever bubble, design, or delusion may\r\npuff up in moments when off their guard. We are now taught to believe\r\nthat legerdemain tricks upon paper can produce as solid wealth as hard\r\nlabor in the earth. It is vain for common sense to urge that _nothing_\r\ncan produce but _nothing_; that it is an idle dream to believe in a\r\nphilosopher's stone which is to turn everything into gold, and to redeem\r\nman from the original sentence of his Maker, \"in the sweat of his brow\r\nshall he eat his bread.\" Not Quixot enough, however, to attempt to reason\r\nBedlam to rights, my anxieties are turned to the most practicable means\r\nof withdrawing us from the ruin into which we have run. Two hundred\r\nmillions of paper in the hands of the people, (and less cannot be from the\r\nemployment of a banking capital known to exceed one hundred millions,)\r\nis a fearful tax to fall at hap-hazard on their heads. The debt which\r\npurchased our independence was but of eighty millions, of which twenty\r\nyears of taxation had in 1809 paid but the one half. And what have we\r\npurchased with this tax of two hundred millions which we are to pay\r\nby wholesale but usury, swindling, and new forms of demoralization.\r\nRevolutionary history has warned us of the probable moment when this\r\nbaseless trash is to receive its fiat. Whenever so much of the precious\r\nmetals shall have returned into the circulation as that every one can\r\nget some in exchange for his produce, paper, as in the revolutionary\r\nwar, will experience at once an universal rejection. When public opinion\r\nchanges, it is with the rapidity of thought. Confidence is already on the\r\ntotter, and every one now handles this paper as if playing at Robin's\r\nalive. That in the present state of the circulation the banks should\r\nresume payments in specie, would require their vaults to be like the\r\nwidow's cruise. The thing to be aimed at is, that the excesses of their\r\nemissions should be withdrawn as gradually, but as speedily, too, as is\r\npracticable, without so much alarm as to bring on the crisis dreaded.\r\nSome banks are said to be calling in their paper. But ought we to let\r\nthis depend on their discretion? Is it not the duty of the legislature\r\nto endeavor to avert from their constituents such a catastrophe as the\r\nextinguishment of two hundred millions of paper in their hands? The\r\ndifficulty is indeed great; and the greater, because the patient revolts\r\nagainst all medicine. I am far from presuming to say that any plan can be\r\nrelied on with certainty, because the bubble may burst from one moment\r\nto another; but if it fails, we shall be but where we should have been\r\nwithout any effort to save ourselves. Different persons, doubtless, will\r\ndevise different schemes of relief. One would be to suppress instantly\r\nthe currency of all paper not issued under the authority of our own\r\nState or of the General Government; to interdict after a few months the\r\ncirculation of all bills of five dollars and under; after a few months\r\nmore, all of ten dollars and under; after other terms, those of twenty,\r\nfifty, and so on to one hundred dollars, which last, if any must be\r\nleft in circulation, should be the lowest denomination. These might be\r\na convenience in mercantile transactions and transmissions, and would be\r\nexcluded by their size from ordinary circulation. But the disease may be\r\ntoo pressing to await such a remedy. With the legislature I cheerfully\r\nleave it to apply this medicine, or no medicine at all. I am sure their\r\nintentions are faithful; and embarked in the same bottom, I am willing\r\nto swim or sink with my fellow citizens. If the latter is their choice,\r\nI will go down with them without a murmur. But my exhortation would\r\nrather be \"not to give up the ship.\"\r\n\r\nI am a great friend to the improvements of roads, canals, and schools.\r\nBut I wish I could see some provision for the former as solid as that\r\nof the latter,--something better than fog. The literary fund is a solid\r\nprovision, unless lost in the impending bankruptcy. If the legislature\r\nwould add to that a perpetual tax of a cent a head on the population of\r\nthe State, it would set agoing at once, and forever maintain, a system\r\nof primary or ward schools, and an university where might be taught,\r\nin its highest degree, every branch of science useful in our time and\r\ncountry; and it would rescue us from the tax of toryism, fanaticism, and\r\nindifferentism to their own State, which we now send our youth to bring\r\nfrom those of New England. If a nation expects to be ignorant and free,\r\nin a state of civilization, it expects what never was and never will be.\r\nThe functionaries of every government have propensities to command at\r\nwill the liberty and property of their constituents. There is no safe\r\ndeposit for these but with the people themselves; nor can they be safe\r\nwith them without information. Where the press is free, and every man\r\nable to read, all is safe. The frankness of this communication will, I am\r\nsure, suggest to you a discreet use of it. I wish to avoid all collisions\r\nof opinion with all mankind. Show it to Mr. Maury, with expressions of\r\nmy great esteem. It pretends to convey no more than the opinions of one\r\nof your thousand constituents, and to claim no more attention than every\r\nother of that thousand.\r\n\r\nI will ask you once more to take care of Miller and our College, and to\r\naccept assurances of my esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CHARLES THOMPSON.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, January 9, 1816.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR AND ANCIENT FRIEND,--An acquaintance of fifty-two years, for I\r\nthink ours dates from 1764, calls for an interchange of notice now and\r\nthen, that we remain in existence, the monuments of another age, and\r\nexamples of a friendship unaffected by the jarring elements by which\r\nwe have been surrounded, of revolutions of government, of party and of\r\nopinion. I am reminded of this duty by the receipt, through our friend\r\nDr. Patterson, of your synopsis of the four Evangelists. I had procured\r\nit as soon as I saw it advertised, and had become familiar with its\r\nuse; but this copy is the more valued as it comes from your hand. This\r\nwork bears the stamp of that accuracy which marks everything from you,\r\nand will be useful to those who, not taking things on trust, recur for\r\nthemselves to the fountain of pure morals. I, too, have made a wee-little\r\nbook from the same materials, which I call the Philosophy of Jesus; it is\r\na paradigma of his doctrines, made by cutting the texts out of the book,\r\nand arranging them on the pages of a blank book, in a certain order of\r\ntime or subject. A more beautiful or precious morsel of ethics I have\r\nnever seen; it is a document in proof that _I_ am a _real Christian_,\r\nthat is to say, a disciple of the doctrines of Jesus, very different from\r\nthe Platonists, who call _me_ infidel and _themselves_ Christians and\r\npreachers of the gospel, while they draw all their characteristic dogmas\r\nfrom what its author never said nor saw. They have compounded from the\r\nheathen mysteries a system beyond the comprehension of man, of which the\r\ngreat reformer of the vicious ethics and deism of the Jews, were he to\r\nreturn on earth, would not recognize one feature. If I had time I would\r\nadd to my little book the Greek, Latin and French texts, in columns side\r\nby side. And I wish I could subjoin a translation of Gosindi's Syntagma\r\nof the doctrines of Epicurus, which, notwithstanding the calumnies of the\r\nStoics and caricatures of Cicero, is the most rational system remaining\r\nof the philosophy of the ancients, as frugal of vicious indulgence, and\r\nfruitful of virtue as the hyperbolical extravagances of his rival sects.\r\n\r\nI retain good health, am rather feeble to walk much, but ride with\r\nease, passing two or three hours a day on horseback, and every three\r\nor four months taking in a carriage a journey of ninety miles to a\r\ndistant possession, where I pass a good deal of my time. My eyes need\r\nthe aid of glasses by night, and with small print in the day also; my\r\nhearing is not quite so sensible as it used to be; no tooth shaking yet,\r\nbut shivering and shrinking in body from the cold we now experience,\r\nmy thermometer having been as low as 12° this morning. My greatest\r\noppression is a correspondence afflictingly laborious, the extent of\r\nwhich I have been long endeavoring to curtail. This keeps me at the\r\ndrudgery of the writing-table all the prime hours of the day, leaving\r\nfor the gratification of my appetite for reading, only what I can steal\r\nfrom the hours of sleep. Could I reduce this epistolary corvée within\r\nthe limits of my friends and affairs, and give the time redeemed from\r\nit to reading and reflection, to history, ethics, mathematics, my life\r\nwould be as happy as the infirmities of age would admit, and I should\r\nlook on its consummation with the composure of one \"_qui summum nec me\r\ntuit diem nec optat_.\"\r\n\r\nSo much as to myself, and I have given you this string of egotisms\r\nin the hope of drawing a similar one from yourself. I have heard from\r\nothers that you retain your health, a good degree of activity, and all\r\nthe vivacity and cheerfulness of your mind, but I wish to learn it more\r\nminutely from yourself. How has time affected your health and spirits?\r\nWhat are your amusements, literary and social? Tell me everything about\r\nyourself, because all will be interesting to me who retains for you ever\r\nthe same constant and affectionate friendship and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO BENJAMIN AUSTIN, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, January 9, 1816.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of December 21st has been received, and I am first\r\nto thank you for the pamphlet it covered. The same description of persons\r\nwhich is the subject of that is so much multiplied here too, as to be\r\nalmost a grievance, and by their numbers in the public councils, have\r\nwrested from the public hand the direction of the pruning knife. But with\r\nus as a body, they are republican, and mostly moderate in their views;\r\nso far, therefore, less objects of jealousy than with you. Your opinions\r\non the events which have taken place in France, are entirely just, so\r\nfar as these events are yet developed. But they have not reached their\r\nultimate termination. There is still an awful void between the present\r\nand what is to be the last chapter of that history; and I fear it is\r\nto be filled with abominations as frightful as those which have already\r\ndisgraced it. That nation is too high-minded, has too much innate force,\r\nintelligence and elasticity, to remain under its present compression.\r\nSamson will arise in his strength, as of old, and as of old will burst\r\nasunder the withes and the cords, and the webs of the Philistines. But\r\nwhat are to be the scenes of havoc and horror, and how widely they\r\nmay spread between brethren of the same house, our ignorance of the\r\ninterior feuds and antipathies of the country places beyond our ken. It\r\nwill end, nevertheless, in a representative government, in a government\r\nin which the will of the people will be an effective ingredient. This\r\nimportant element has taken root in the European mind, and will have\r\nits growth; their despots, sensible of this, are already offering this\r\nmodification of their governments, as if of their own accord. Instead\r\nof the parricide treason of Bonaparte, in perverting the means confided\r\nto him as a republican magistrate, to the subversion of that republic\r\nand erection of a military despotism for himself and his family, had he\r\nused it honestly for the establishment and support of a free government\r\nin his own country, France would now have been in freedom and rest; and\r\nher example operating in a contrary direction, every nation in Europe\r\nwould have had a government over which the will of the people would\r\nhave had some control. His atrocious egotism has checked the salutary\r\nprogress of principle, and deluged it with rivers of blood which are\r\nnot yet run out. To the vast sum of devastation and of human misery, of\r\nwhich he has been the guilty cause, much is still to be added. But the\r\nobject is fixed in the eye of nations, and they will press on to its\r\naccomplishment and to the general amelioration of the condition of man.\r\nWhat a germ have we planted, and how faithfully should we cherish the\r\nparent tree at home!\r\n\r\nYou tell me I am quoted by those who wish to continue our dependence\r\non England for manufactures. There was a time when I might have been\r\nso quoted with more candor, but within the thirty years which have\r\nsince elapsed, how are circumstances changed! We were then in peace.\r\nOur independent place among nations was acknowledged. A commerce which\r\noffered the raw material in exchange for the same material after receiving\r\nthe last touch of industry, was worthy of welcome to all nations. It\r\nwas expected that those especially to whom manufacturing industry was\r\nimportant, would cherish the friendship of such customers by every\r\nfavor, by every inducement, and particularly cultivate their peace by\r\nevery act of justice and friendship. Under this prospect the question\r\nseemed legitimate, whether, with such an immensity of unimproved land,\r\ncourting the hand of husbandry, the industry of agriculture, or that\r\nof manufactures, would add most to the national wealth? And the doubt\r\nwas entertained on this consideration chiefly, that to the labor of\r\nthe husbandman a vast addition is made by the spontaneous energies of\r\nthe earth on which it is employed: for one grain of wheat committed to\r\nthe earth, she renders twenty, thirty, and even fifty fold, whereas to\r\nthe labor of the manufacturer nothing is added. Pounds of flax, in his\r\nhands, yield, on the contrary, but pennyweights of lace. This exchange,\r\ntoo, laborious as it might seem, what a field did it promise for the\r\noccupations of the ocean; what a nursery for that class of citizens who\r\nwere to exercise and maintain our equal rights on that element? This was\r\nthe state of things in 1785, when the \"Notes on Virginia\" were first\r\nprinted; when, the ocean being open to all nations, and their common\r\nright in it acknowledged and exercised under regulations sanctioned by the\r\nassent and usage of all, it was thought that the doubt might claim some\r\nconsideration. But who in 1785 could foresee the rapid depravity which\r\nwas to render the close of that century the disgrace of the history of\r\nman? Who could have imagined that the two most distinguished in the rank\r\nof nations, for science and civilization, would have suddenly descended\r\nfrom that honorable eminence, and setting at defiance all those moral laws\r\nestablished by the Author of nature between nation and nation, as between\r\nman and man, would cover earth and sea with robberies and piracies,\r\nmerely because strong enough to do it with temporal impunity; and that\r\nunder this disbandment of nations from social order, we should have been\r\ndespoiled of a thousand ships, and have thousands of our citizens reduced\r\nto Algerine slavery. Yet all this has taken place. One of these nations\r\ninterdicted to our vessels all harbors of the globe without having first\r\nproceeded to some one of hers, there paid a tribute proportioned to the\r\ncargo, and obtained her license to proceed to the port of destination. The\r\nother declared them to be lawful prize if they had touched at the port,\r\nor been visited by a ship of the enemy nation. Thus were we completely\r\nexcluded from the ocean. Compare this state of things with that of '85,\r\nand say whether an opinion founded in the circumstances of that day can\r\nbe fairly applied to those of the present. We have experienced what we\r\ndid not then believe, that there exists both profligacy and power enough\r\nto exclude us from the field of interchange with other nations: that to\r\nbe independent for the comforts of life we must fabricate them ourselves.\r\nWe must now place the manufacturer by the side of the agriculturist.\r\nThe former question is suppressed, or rather assumes a new form. Shall\r\nwe make our own comforts, or go without them, at the will of a foreign\r\nnation? He, therefore, who is now against domestic manufacture, must be\r\nfor reducing us either to dependence on that foreign nation, or to be\r\nclothed in skins, and to live like wild beasts in dens and caverns. I\r\nam not one of these; experience has taught me that manufactures are now\r\nas necessary to our independence as to our comfort; and if those who\r\nquote me as of a different opinion, will keep pace with me in purchasing\r\nnothing foreign where an equivalent of domestic fabric can be obtained,\r\nwithout regard to difference of price, it will not be our fault if we\r\ndo not soon have a supply at home equal to our demand, and wrest that\r\nweapon of distress from the hand which has wielded it. If it shall be\r\nproposed to go beyond our own supply, the question of '85 will then\r\nrecur, will our _surplus_ labor be then most beneficially employed in the\r\nculture of the earth, or in the fabrications of art? We have time yet for\r\nconsideration, before that question will press upon us; and the maxim\r\nto be applied will depend on the circumstances which shall then exist;\r\nfor in so complicated a science as political economy, no one axiom can\r\nbe laid down as wise and expedient for all times and circumstances, and\r\nfor their contraries. Inattention to this is what has called for this\r\nexplanation, which reflection would have rendered unnecessary with the\r\ncandid, while nothing will do it with those who use the former opinion\r\nonly as a stalking horse, to cover their disloyal propensities to keep\r\nus in eternal vassalage to a foreign and unfriendly people.\r\n\r\nI salute you with assurances of great respect and esteem.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n                                              MONTICELLO, January 11, 1816.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Of the last five months I have passed four at my other domicil,\r\nfor such it is in a considerable degree. No letters are forwarded to me\r\nthere, because the cross post to that place is circuitous and uncertain;\r\nduring my absence, therefore, they are accumulating here, and awaiting\r\nacknowledgments. This has been the fate of your favor of November 13th.\r\n\r\nI agree with you in all its eulogies on the eighteenth century. It\r\ncertainly witnessed the sciences and arts, manners and morals, advanced\r\nto a higher degree than the world had ever before seen. And might we not\r\ngo back to the æra of the Borgias, by which time the barbarous ages had\r\nreduced national morality to its lowest point of depravity, and observe\r\nthat the arts and sciences, rising from that point, advanced gradually\r\nthrough all the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, softening\r\nand correcting the manners and morals of man? I think, too, we may add to\r\nthe great honor of science and the arts, that their natural effect is,\r\nby illuminating public opinion, to erect it into a censor, before which\r\nthe most exalted tremble for their future, as well as present fame. With\r\nsome exceptions only, through the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries,\r\nmorality occupied an honorable chapter in the political code of nations.\r\nYou must have observed while in Europe, as I thought I did, that those\r\nwho administered the governments of the greater powers at least, had\r\na respect to faith, and considered the dignity of their government as\r\ninvolved in its integrity. A wound indeed was inflicted on this character\r\nof honor in the eighteenth century by the partition of Poland. But this\r\nwas the atrocity of a barbarous government chiefly, in conjunction with\r\na smaller one still scrambling to become great, while one only of those\r\nalready great, and having character to lose, descended to the baseness\r\nof an accomplice in the crime. France, England, Spain, shared in it only\r\ninasmuch as they stood aloof and permitted its perpetration.\r\n\r\nHow then has it happened that these nations, France especially and\r\nEngland, so great, so dignified, so distinguished by science and the\r\narts, plunged all at once into all the depths of human enormity, threw\r\noff suddenly and openly all the restraints of morality, all sensation to\r\ncharacter, and unblushingly avowed and acted on the principle that power\r\nwas right? Can this sudden apostasy from national rectitude be accounted\r\nfor? The treaty of Pilnitz seems to have begun it, suggested perhaps by\r\nthe baneful precedent of Poland. Was it from the terror of monarchs,\r\nalarmed at the light returning on them from the west, and kindling a\r\nvolcano under their thrones? Was it a combination to extinguish that\r\nlight, and to bring back, as their best auxiliaries, those enumerated\r\nby you, the Sorbonne, the Inquisition, the Index Expurgatorius, and the\r\nknights of Loyola? Whatever it was, the close of the century saw the\r\nmoral world thrown back again to the age of the Borgias, to the point from\r\nwhich it had departed three hundred years before. France, after crushing\r\nand punishing the conspiracy of Pilnitz, went herself deeper and deeper\r\ninto the crimes she had been chastising. I say France and not Bonaparte;\r\nfor, although he was the head and mouth, the nation furnished the hands\r\nwhich executed his enormities. England, although in opposition, kept\r\nfull pace with France, not indeed by the manly force of her own arms,\r\nbut by oppressing the weak and bribing the strong. At length the whole\r\nchoir joined and divided the weaker nations among them. Your prophecies\r\nto Dr. Price proved truer than mine; and yet fell short of the fact, for\r\ninstead of a million, the destruction of eight or ten millions of human\r\nbeings has probably been the effect of these convulsions. I did not,\r\nin '89, believe they would have lasted so long, nor have cost so much\r\nblood. But although your prophecy has proved true so far, I hope it does\r\nnot preclude a better final result. That same light from our west seems\r\nto have spread and illuminated the very engines employed to extinguish\r\nit. It has given them a glimmering of their rights and their power. The\r\nidea of representative government has taken root and growth among them.\r\nTheir masters feel it, and are saving themselves by timely offers of\r\nthis modification of their powers. Belgium, Prussia, Poland, Lombardy,\r\n&c., are now offered a representative organization; illusive probably at\r\nfirst, but it will grow into power in the end. Opinion is power, and that\r\nopinion will come. Even France will yet attain representative government.\r\nYou observe it makes the basis of every constitution which has been\r\ndemanded or offered,--of that demanded by their Senate; of that offered by\r\nBonaparte; and of that granted by Louis XVIII. The idea then is rooted,\r\nand will be established, although rivers of blood may yet flow between\r\nthem and their object. The allied armies now couching upon them are first\r\nto be destroyed, and destroyed they will surely be. A nation united can\r\nnever be conquered. We have seen what the ignorant, bigoted and unarmed\r\nSpaniards could do against the disciplined veterans of their invaders.\r\nWhat then may we not expect from the power and character of the French\r\nnation? The oppressors may cut off heads after heads, but like those of\r\nthe Hydra they multiply at every stroke. The recruits within a nation's\r\nown limits are prompt and without number; while those of their invaders\r\nfrom a distance are slow, limited, and must come to an end. I think, too,\r\nwe perceive that all these allies do not see the same interest in the\r\nannihilation of the power of France. There are certainly some symptoms\r\nof foresight in Alexander that France might produce a salutary diversion\r\nof force were Austria and Prussia to become her enemies. France, too,\r\nis the neutral ally of the Turk, as having no interfering interests,\r\nand might be useful in neutralizing and perhaps turning that power on\r\nAustria. That a re-acting jealousy, too, exists with Austria and Prussia,\r\nI think their late strict alliance indicates; and I should not wonder\r\nif Spain should discover a sympathy with them. Italy is so divided as\r\nto be nothing. Here then we see new coalitions in embryo, which, after\r\nFrance shall in turn have suffered a just punishment for her crimes,\r\nwill not only raise her from the earth on which she is prostrate, but\r\ngive her an opportunity to establish a government of as much liberty\r\nas she can bear--enough to ensure her happiness and prosperity. When\r\ninsurrection begins, be it where it will, all the partitioned countries\r\nwill rush to arms, and Europe again become an arena of gladiators. And\r\nwhat is the definite object they will propose? A restoration certainly\r\nof the _status quo prius_, of the state of possession of '89. I see no\r\nother principle on which Europe can ever again settle down in lasting\r\npeace. I hope your prophecies will go thus far, as my wishes do, and that\r\nthey, like the former, will prove to have been the sober dictates of a\r\nsuperior understanding, and a sound calculation of effects from causes\r\nwell understood. Some future Morgan will then have an opportunity of doing\r\nyou justice, and of counterbalancing the breach of confidence of which you\r\nso justly complain, and in which no one has had more frequent occasion\r\nof fellow-feeling than myself. Permit me to place here my affectionate\r\nrespects to Mrs. Adams, and to add for yourself the assurances of cordial\r\nfriendship and esteem.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DABNEY CARR.\r\n\r\n                                              MONTICELLO, January 19, 1816.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--At the date of your letter of December the 1st, I was in\r\nBedford, and since my return, so many letters, accumulated during my\r\nabsence, have been pressing for answers, that this is the first moment\r\nI have been able to attend to the subject of yours. While Mr. Girardin\r\nwas in this neighborhood writing his continuation of Burke's history,\r\nI had suggested to him a proper notice of the establishment of the\r\ncommittee of correspondence here in 1773, and of Mr. Carr, your father,\r\nwho introduced it. He has doubtless done this, and his work is now in\r\nthe press. My books, journals of the times, &c., being all gone, I have\r\nnothing now but an impaired memory to resort to for the more particular\r\nstatement you wish. But I give it with the more confidence, as I find\r\nthat I remember old things better than new. The transaction took place\r\nin the session of Assembly of March 1773. Patrick Henry, Richard Henry\r\nLee, Frank Lee, your father and myself, met by agreement, one evening,\r\nabout the close of the session, at the Raleigh Tavern, to consult on\r\nthe measures which the circumstances of the times seemed to call for.\r\nWe agreed, in result, that concert in the operations of the several\r\ncolonies was indispensable; and that to produce this, some channel of\r\ncorrespondence between them must be opened; that therefore, we would\r\npropose to our House the appointment of a committee of correspondence,\r\nwhich should be authorized and instructed to write to the Speakers of\r\nthe House of Representatives of the several Colonies, recommending the\r\nappointment of similar committees on their part, who, by a communication\r\nof sentiment on the transactions threatening us all, might promote a\r\nharmony of action salutary to all. This was the substance, not pretending\r\nto remember the words. We proposed the resolution, and your father was\r\nagreed on to make the motion. He did it the next day, March the 12th,\r\nwith great ability, reconciling all to it, not only by the reasonings,\r\nbut by the temper and moderation with which it was developed. It was\r\nadopted by a very general vote. Peyton Randolph, some of us who proposed\r\nit, and who else I do not remember, were appointed of the committee.\r\nWe immediately despatched letters by expresses to the Speakers of all\r\nthe other Assemblies. I remember that Mr. Carr and myself, returning\r\nhome together, and conversing on the subject by the way, concurred in\r\nthe conclusion that that measure must inevitably beget the meeting of a\r\nCongress of Deputies from all the colonies, for the purpose of uniting\r\nall in the same principles and measures for the maintenance of our\r\nrights. My memory cannot deceive me, when I affirm that we did it in\r\nconsequence of no such proposition from any other colony. No doubt the\r\nresolution itself and the journals of the day will show that ours was\r\noriginal, and not merely responsive to one from any other quarter. Yet,\r\nI am certain I remember also, that a similar proposition, and nearly\r\ncotemporary, was made by Massachusetts, and that our northern messenger\r\npassed theirs on the road. This, too, may be settled by recurrence to the\r\nrecords of Massachusetts. The proposition was generally acceded to by the\r\nother colonies, and the first effect, as expected, was the meeting of a\r\nCongress at New York the ensuing year. The committee of correspondence\r\nappointed by Massachusetts, as quoted by you from Marshall, under\r\nthe date of 1770, must have been for a special purpose, and _functus\r\nofficio_ before the date of 1773, or Massachusetts herself would not\r\nthen have proposed another. Records should be examined to settle this\r\naccurately. I well remember the pleasure expressed in the countenance\r\nand conversation of the members generally, on this _debut_ of Mr. Carr,\r\nand the hopes they conceived as well from the talents as the patriotism\r\nit manifested. But he died within two months after, and in him we lost a\r\npowerful fellow-laborer. His character was of a high order. A spotless\r\nintegrity, sound judgment, handsome imagination, enriched by education\r\nand reading, quick and clear in his conceptions, of correct and ready\r\nelocution, impressing every hearer with the sincerity of the heart from\r\nwhich it flowed. His firmness was inflexible in whatever he thought was\r\nright; but when no moral principle stood in the way, never had man more\r\nof the milk of human kindness, of indulgence, of softness, of pleasantry\r\nof conversation and conduct. The number of his friends, and the warmth\r\nof their affection, were proofs of his worth, and of their estimate of\r\nit. To give to those now living, an idea of the affliction produced by\r\nhis death in the minds of all who knew him, I liken it to that lately\r\nfelt by themselves on the death of his eldest son, Peter Carr, so like\r\nhim in all his endowments and moral qualities, and whose recollection\r\ncan never recur without a deep-drawn sigh from the bosom of any one who\r\nknew him. You mention that I showed you an inscription I had proposed\r\nfor the tomb stone of your father. Did I leave it in your hands to be\r\ncopied? I ask the question, not that I have any such recollection, but\r\nthat I find it no longer in the place of its deposit, and think I never\r\ntook it out but on that occasion. Ever and affectionately yours.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DR. PETER WILSON, PROFESSOR OF LANGUAGES, COLUMBIA COLLEGE, NEW YORK.\r\n\r\n                                              MONTICELLO, January 20, 1816.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Of the last five months, I have been absent four from home, which\r\nmust apologize for so very late an acknowledgment of your favor of\r\nNovember 22d, and I wish the delay could be compensated by the matter\r\nof the answer. But an unfortunate accident puts that out of my power.\r\nDuring the course of my public life, and from a very early period of\r\nit, I omitted no opportunity of procuring vocabularies of the Indian\r\nlanguages, and for that purpose formed a model expressing such objects\r\nin nature as must be familiar to every people, savage or civilized.\r\nThis being made the standard to which all were brought, would exhibit\r\nreadily whatever affinities of language there be between the several\r\ntribes. It was my intention, on retiring from public business, to have\r\ndigested these into some order, so as to show not only what relations of\r\nlanguage existed among our own aborigines, but by a collation with the\r\ngreat Russian vocabulary of the languages of Europe and Asia, whether\r\nthere were any between them and the other nations of the continent. On my\r\nremoval from Washington, the package in which this collection was coming\r\nby water, was stolen and destroyed. It consisted of between thirty and\r\nforty vocabularies, of which I can, from memory, say nothing particular;\r\nbut that I am certain more than half of them differed as radically,\r\neach from every other, as the Greek, the Latin, and Islandic. And even\r\nof those which seemed to be derived from the same radix, the departure\r\nwas such that the tribes speaking them could not probably understand\r\none another. Single words, or two or three together, might perhaps be\r\nunderstood, but not a whole sentence of any extent or construction. I\r\nthink, therefore, the pious missionaries who shall go to the several\r\ntribes to instruct them in the Christian religion, will have to learn\r\na language for every tribe they go to; nay, more, that they will have\r\nto create a new language for every one, that is to say, to add to\r\ntheirs new words for the new ideas they will have to communicate. Law,\r\nmedicine, chemistry, mathematics, every science has a language of its\r\nown, and divinity not less than others. Their barren vocabularies cannot\r\nbe vehicles for ideas of the fall of man, his redemption, the triune\r\ncomposition of the Godhead, and other mystical doctrines considered\r\nby most Christians of the present date as essential elements of faith.\r\nThe enterprise is therefore arduous, but the more inviting perhaps to\r\nmissionary zeal, in proportion as the merit of surmounting it will be\r\ngreater. Again repeating my regrets that I am able to give so little\r\nsatisfaction on the subject of your inquiry, I pray you to accept the\r\nassurance of my great consideration and esteem.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. AMOS J. COOK, PRECEPTOR OF FRYEBURG ACADEMY IN THE DISTRICT OF\r\nMAINE.\r\n\r\n                                              MONTICELLO, January 21, 1816.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your favor of December 18th was exactly a month on its way to\r\nthis place; and I have to thank you for the elegant and philosophical\r\nlines communicated by the Nestor of our Revolution. Whether the style\r\nor sentiment be considered, they were well worthy the trouble of being\r\ncopied and communicated by his pen. Nor am I less thankful for the happy\r\ntranslation of them. It adds another to the rare instances of a rival\r\nto its original: superior indeed in one respect, as the same outline\r\nof sentiment is brought within a compass of better proportion. For if\r\nthe original be liable to any criticism, it is that of giving too great\r\nextension to the same general idea. Yet it has a great authority to\r\nsupport it, that of a wiser man than all of us. \"I sought in my heart\r\nto give myself unto wine; I made me great works; I builded me houses;\r\nI planted me vineyards; I made me gardens, and orchards, and pools to\r\nwater them; I got me servants and maidens, and great possessions of\r\ncattle; I gathered me also silver and gold, and men singers and women\r\nsingers, and the delights of the sons of men, and musical instruments\r\nof all sorts; and whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them;\r\nI withheld not my heart from any joy. Then I looked on all the works\r\nthat my hands had wrought, and behold! all was vanity and vexation of\r\nspirit! I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth\r\ndarkness.\" The Preacher, whom I abridge, has indulged in a much larger\r\namplification of his subject. I am not so happy as my friend and ancient\r\ncolleague, Mr. Adams, in possessing anything original, _inedited_, and\r\nworthy of comparison with the epigraph of the Spanish monk. I can offer\r\nbut humble prose, from the hand indeed of the father of eloquence and\r\nphilosophy; a moral morsel, which our young friends under your tuition\r\nshould keep ever in their eye, as the ultimate term of your instructions,\r\nand of their labors. \"Hic, quisquis est, qui moderatione et constantia\r\nquietus animo est, sibique ipse placatus; ut nec tabescat molestiis,\r\nnec frangatur timore, nec sitienter quid expectens ardeat desiderio, nec\r\nalacritate futili gestiens deliquescat; is est sapiens, quem quaerimus;\r\nis est beatus; cui nihil humanarum rerum aut intolerabile ad dimittendum\r\nanimum, aut nimis lactabile ad efferendum, videri potest.\" Or if a\r\npoetical dress will be more acceptable to the fancy of the juvenile\r\nstudent:\r\n\r\n     \"Quisnam igitur liber? Sapiens, sibique imperiosus:\r\n     Quem neque pauperies, neque mors, neque vincula terrent:\r\n     Responsare cupidinibus, contemnere honores\r\n     Fortis, et in scipso totus teres, atque rotundus;\r\n     Externi ne quid valeat per laeve morari:\r\n     In quem manea ruit semper Fortuna.\"\r\n\r\nAnd if the Wise be the happy man, as these sages say, he must be virtuous\r\ntoo; for, without virtue, happiness cannot be. This then is the true\r\nscope of all academical emulation.\r\n\r\nYou request something in the handwriting of General Washington. I enclose\r\nyou a letter which I received from him while in Paris, covering a copy\r\nof the new Constitution; it is offered merely as what you ask, a specimen\r\nof his handwriting.\r\n\r\nOn the subject of your Museum, I fear I cannot flatter myself with being\r\nuseful to it. Were the obstacle of distance out of the way, age and\r\nretirement have withdrawn me from the opportunities of procuring objects\r\nin that line. With every wish for the prosperity of your institution,\r\naccept the assurances of my great esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. THOMAS RITCHIE.\r\n\r\n                                              MONTICELLO, January 21, 1816.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--In answering the letter of a northern correspondent lately,\r\nI indulged in a tirade against a pamphlet recently published in this\r\nquarter. On revising my letter, however, I thought it unsafe to commit\r\nmyself so far to a stranger. I struck out the passage therefore, yet I\r\nthink the pamphlet of such a character as not to be unknown, or unnoticed\r\nby the people of the United States. It is the most bold and impudent\r\nstride New England has ever made in arrogating an ascendency over the\r\nrest of the Union. The first form of the pamphlet was an address from\r\nthe Reverend Lyman Beecher, chairman of the Connecticut Society for the\r\neducation of _pious_ young men for the ministry. Its matter was then\r\nadopted and published in a sermon by Reverend Mr. Pearson of Andover in\r\nMassachusetts, where they have a _theological_ college; and where the\r\naddress \"with circumstantial variations to adopt it to more general use\"\r\nis reprinted on a sheet and a half of paper, in so cheap a form as to\r\nbe distributed, I imagine, gratis, for it has a final note indicating\r\nsix thousand copies of the first edition printed. So far as it respects\r\nVirginia, the extract of my letter gives the outline. I therefore send\r\nit to you to publish or burn, abridge or alter, as you think best.\r\nYou understand the public palate better than I do. Only give it such\r\na title as may lead to no suspicion from whom you receive it. I am the\r\nmore induced to offer it to you because it is possible mine may be the\r\nonly copy in the State, and because, too, it may be _à propos_ for the\r\npetition for the establishment of _a theological society_ now before the\r\nlegislature, and to which they have shown the unusual respect of hearing\r\nan advocate for it at their bar. From what quarter this theological\r\nsociety comes forward I know not; perhaps from our own tramontaine clergy,\r\nof New England religion and politics; perhaps it is the entering wedge\r\nfrom its _theological_ sister in Andover, for the body of \"qualified\r\nreligious instructors\" proposed by their pious brethren of the East \"to\r\nevangelize and catechize,\" to edify our daughters by weekly lectures, and\r\nour wives by \"family visits\" from these pious young monks from Harvard\r\nand Yale. However, do with this what you please, and be assured of my\r\nfriendship and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO NATHANIEL MACON.\r\n\r\n                                              MONTICELLO, January 22, 1816.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of the 7th, after being a fortnight on the road,\r\nreached this the last night. On the subject of the statue of General\r\nWashington, which the legislature of North Carolina has ordered to be\r\nprocured, and set up in their capitol, I shall willingly give you my\r\nbest information and opinions.\r\n\r\n1. Your first inquiry is whether one worthy the character it is to\r\nrepresent, and the State which erects it, can be made in the United\r\nStates? Certainly it cannot. I do not know that there is a single marble\r\nstatuary in the United States, but I am sure there cannot be one who would\r\noffer himself as qualified to undertake this monument of gratitude and\r\ntaste. Besides, no quarry of statuary marble has yet, I believe, been\r\nopened in the United States, that is to say, of a marble pure white,\r\nand in blocks of sufficient size, without vein or flaw. The quarry of\r\nCarara, in Italy, is the only one in the accessible parts of Europe which\r\nfurnishes such blocks. It was from thence we brought to Paris that for\r\nthe statue of General Washington, made there on account of this State;\r\nand it is from there that all the southern and maritime parts of Europe\r\nare supplied with that character of marble.\r\n\r\n2. Who should make it? There can be but one answer to this. Old Canova,\r\nof Rome. No artist in Europe would place himself in a line with him;\r\nand for thirty years, within my own knowledge, he has been considered\r\nby all Europe as without a rival. He draws his blocks from Carara, and\r\ndelivers the statue complete, and packed for transportation, at Rome;\r\nfrom thence it descends the Tiber, but whether it must go to Leghorn,\r\nor some other shipping port, I do not know.\r\n\r\n3. Price, time, size, and style? It will probably take a couple of years\r\nto be ready. I am not able to be exact as to the price. We gave Houdon,\r\nat Paris, one thousand guineas for the one he made for this State; but\r\nhe solemnly and feelingly protested against the inadequacy of the price,\r\nand evidently undertook it on motives of reputation alone. He was the\r\nfirst artist in France, and being willing to come over to take the model\r\nof the General, which we could not have got Canova to have done, that\r\ncircumstance decided on his employment. We paid him additionally for\r\ncoming over about five hundred guineas; and when the statue was done,\r\nwe paid the expenses of one of his under workmen to come over and set\r\nit up, which might, perhaps, be one hundred guineas more. I suppose,\r\ntherefore, it cost us, in the whole, eight thousand dollars. But this\r\nwas only of the size of life. Yours should be something larger. The\r\ndifference it makes in the impression can scarcely be conceived. As to\r\nthe style or costume, I am sure the artist, and every person of taste in\r\nEurope, would be for the Roman, the effect of which is undoubtedly of\r\na different order. Our boots and regimentals have a very puny effect.\r\nWorks of this kind are about one-third cheaper at Rome than Paris; but\r\nCanova's eminence will be a sensible ingredient in price. I think that for\r\nsuch a statue, with a plain pedestal, you would have a good bargain from\r\nCanova at seven or eight thousand dollars, and should not be surprised\r\nwere he to require ten thousand dollars, to which you would have to add\r\nthe charges of bringing over and setting up. The one-half of the price\r\nwould probably have to be advanced, and the other half paid on delivery.\r\n\r\n4. From what model? Ciracchi made the bust of General Washington in\r\nplaster. It was the finest which came from his hand, and my own opinion\r\nof Ciracchi was, that he was second to no sculptor living except Canova;\r\nand, if he had lived, would have rivalled him. His style had been\r\nformed on the fine models of antiquity in Italy, and he had caught their\r\nineffable majesty of expression. On his return to Rome, he made the bust\r\nof the General in marble, from that in plaster; it was sent over here,\r\nwas universally considered as the best effigy of him ever executed, was\r\nbought by the Spanish Minister for the king of Spain, and sent to Madrid.\r\nAfter the death of Ciracchi, Mr. Appleton, our Consul at Leghorn, a man\r\nof worth and taste, purchased of his widow the original plaster, with\r\na view to profit by copies of marble and plaster from it. He still has\r\nit at Leghorn; and it is the only original from which the statue can be\r\nformed. But the exterior of the figure will also be wanting, that is\r\nto say, the outward lineaments of the body and members, to enable the\r\nartist to give to them also their true forms and proportions. There are,\r\nI believe, in Philadelphia, whole length paintings of General Washington,\r\nfrom which, I presume, old Mr. Peale or his son would sketch on canvas\r\nthe mere outlines at no great charge. This sketch, with Ciracchi's bust,\r\nwill suffice.\r\n\r\n5. Through whose agency? None so ready or so competent as Mr. Appleton\r\nhimself; he has had relations with Canova, is a judge of price, convenient\r\nto engage the work, to attend to its progress, to receive and forward\r\nit to North Carolina. Besides the accommodation of the original bust to\r\nbe asked from him, he will probably have to go to Rome himself, to make\r\nthe contract, and will incur a great deal of trouble besides, from that\r\ntime to the delivery in North Carolina; and it should therefore be made\r\na matter of interest with him to act in it, as his time and trouble is\r\nhis support. I imagine his agency from beginning to end would not be\r\nworth less than from one to two hundred guineas. I particularize all\r\nthese things, that you may not be surprised with after-claps of expense,\r\nnot counted on beforehand. Mr. Appleton has two nephews at Baltimore,\r\nboth in the mercantile line, and in correspondence with him. Should the\r\nGovernor adopt this channel of execution, he will have no other trouble\r\nthan that of sending to them his communications for Mr. Appleton, and\r\nmaking the remittances agreed on as shall be convenient to himself. A\r\nletter from the Secretary of State to Mr. Appleton, informing him that\r\nany service he can render the State of North Carolina in this business,\r\nwould be gratifying to his government, would not be without effect.\r\n\r\nAccept the assurance of my great esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOSEPH C. CABELL.\r\n\r\n                                              MONTICELLO, January 24, 1816.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of the 16th experienced great delay on the road,\r\nand to avoid that of another mail, I must answer very briefly.\r\n\r\nMy letter to Peter Carr contains all I ever wrote on the subject of the\r\nCollege, a plan for the institution being the only thing the trustees\r\nasked or expected from me. Were it to go into execution, I should\r\ncertainly interest myself further and strongly in procuring proper\r\nprofessors.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of a Proctor is taken from the practice of Europe,\r\nwhere an equivalent officer is made a part, and is a very essential\r\none, of every such institution; and as the nature of his functions\r\nrequires that he should always be a man of discretion, understanding,\r\nand integrity above the common level, it was thought that he would never\r\nbe less worthy of being trusted with the powers of a justice, within\r\nthe limits of institution here, than the neighboring justices generally\r\nare; and the vesting him with the conservation of the peace within\r\nthat limit, was intended, while it should equally secure its object, to\r\nshield the young and unguarded student from the disgrace of the common\r\nprison, except where the case was an aggravated one. A confinement to\r\nhis own room was meant as an act of tenderness to him, his parents and\r\nfriends; in fine, it was to give them a complete police of their own,\r\ntempered by the paternal attentions of their tutors. And, certainly,\r\nin no country is such a provision more called for than in this, as has\r\nbeen proved from times of old, from the regular annual riots and battles\r\nbetween the students of William and Mary with the town boys, before the\r\nrevolution, _quorum pars fui_, and the many and more serious affrays of\r\nlater times. Observe, too, that our bill proposes no exclusion of the\r\nordinary magistrate, if the one attached to the institution is thought\r\nto execute his power either partially or remissly.\r\n\r\nThe transfer of the power to give commencement to the Ward or Elementary\r\nSchools from the court and aldermen to the visitors, was proposed because\r\nthe experience of twenty years has proved that no court will ever begin\r\nit. The reason is obvious. The members of the courts are the wealthy\r\nmembers of the counties; and as the expenses of the schools are to be\r\ndefrayed by a contribution proportioned to the aggregate of other taxes\r\nwhich every one pays, they consider it as a plan to educate the poor at\r\nthe expense of the rich. It proceeded, too, from a hope that the example\r\nand good effects being exhibited in one county, they would spread from\r\ncounty to county and become general. The modification of the law, by\r\nauthorizing the alderman to require the expense of tutorage from such\r\nparents as are able, would render trifling, if not wholly prevent, any\r\ncall on the county for pecuniary aid. You know that nothing better than a\r\nlog-house is required for these schools, and there is not a neighborhood\r\nwhich would not meet and build this themselves for the sake of having\r\na school near them.\r\n\r\nI know of no peculiar advantage which Charlottesville offers for Mr.\r\nBraidwood's school of deaf and dumb. On the contrary, I should think\r\nthe vicinity of the seat of government most favorable to it. I should\r\nnot like to have it made a member of our College. The objects of the two\r\ninstitutions are fundamentally distinct. The one is science, the other\r\nmere charity. It would be gratuitously taking a boat in tow which may\r\nimpede, but cannot aid the motion of the principal institution.\r\n\r\nEver and affectionately yours.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO REV. MR. WORCESTER.\r\n\r\n                                              MONTICELLO, January 29, 1816.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your letter bearing date October 18th, 1815, came only to hand the\r\nday before yesterday, which is mentioned to explain the date of mine. I\r\nhave to thank you for the pamphlets accompanying it, to wit, the Solemn\r\nReview, the Friend of Peace or Special Interview, and the Friend of\r\nPeace, No. 2; the first of these I had received through another channel\r\nsome months ago. I have not read the two last steadily through, because\r\nwhere one assents to propositions as soon as announced it is loss of\r\ntime to read the arguments in support of them. These numbers discuss the\r\nfirst branch of the causes of war, that is to say, wars undertaken for\r\nthe _point of honor_, which you aptly analogize with the act of duelling\r\nbetween individuals, and reason with justice from the one to the other.\r\nUndoubtedly this class of wars is, in the general, what you state them to\r\nbe, \"needless, unjust and inhuman, as well as anti-Christian.\" The second\r\nbranch of this subject, to wit, wars undertaken on account of _wrong\r\ndone_, and which may be likened to the act of robbery in private life, I\r\npresume will be treated of in your future numbers. I observe this class\r\nmentioned in the Solemn Review, p. 10, and the question asked, \"Is it\r\ncommon for a nation to obtain a _redress_ of wrongs by war?\" The answer\r\nto this question you will of course draw from history. In the meantime,\r\nreason will answer it on grounds of probability, that where the wrong has\r\nbeen done by a weaker nation, the stronger one has generally been able\r\nto enforce redress; but where by a stronger nation, redress by war has\r\nbeen neither obtained nor expected by the weaker. On the contrary, the\r\nloss has been increased by the expenses of the war in blood and treasure.\r\nYet it may have obtained another object equally securing itself from\r\nfuture wrong. It may have retaliated on the aggressor losses of blood\r\nand treasure far beyond the value to him of the wrong he had committed,\r\nand thus have made the advantage of that too dear a purchase to leave\r\nhim in a disposition to renew the wrong in future. In this way the loss\r\nby the war may have secured the weaker nation from loss by future wrong.\r\nThe case you state of two boxers both of whom get a \"terrible bruising,\"\r\nis opposite to this. He of the two who committed the aggression on the\r\nother, although victor in the scuffle, yet probably finds his aggression\r\nnot worth the bruising it has cost him. To explain this by numbers,\r\nit is alleged that Great Britain took from us before the late war near\r\none thousand vessels, and that during the war we took from her fourteen\r\nhundred. That before the war she seized and made slaves of six thousand\r\nof our citizens, and that in the war we killed more than six thousand\r\nof her subjects, and caused her to expend such a sum as amounted to four\r\nor five thousand guineas a head for every slave she made. She might have\r\npurchased the vessels she took for less than the value of those she lost,\r\nand have used the six thousand of her men killed for the purposes to\r\nwhich she applied ours, have saved the four or five thousand guineas a\r\nhead, and obtained a character of justice which is valuable to a nation\r\nas to an individual. These considerations, therefore, leave her without\r\ninducement to plunder property and take men in future on such dear\r\nterms. I neither affirm nor deny the truth of these allegations, nor is\r\ntheir truth material to the question. They are possible, and therefore\r\npresent a case which will claim your consideration in a discussion of\r\nthe general question whether any degree of injury can render a recourse\r\nto war expedient? Still less do I propose to draw to myself any part in\r\nthis discussion. Age and its effects both on body and mind, has weaned\r\nmy attentions from public subjects, and left me unequal to the labors\r\nof correspondence beyond the limits of my personal concerns. I retire,\r\ntherefore, from the question, with a sincere wish that your writings\r\nmay have effect in lessening this greatest of human evils, and that\r\nyou may retain life and health to enjoy the contemplation of this happy\r\nspectacle; and pray you to be assured of my great respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOSEPH C. CABELL, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                              MONTICELLO, February 2d, 1816\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favors of the 23d and 24th ult., were a week coming\r\nto us. I instantly enclosed to you the deeds of Capt. Miller, but I\r\nunderstand that the Post Master, having locked his mail before they got\r\nto the office, would not unlock it to give them a passage.\r\n\r\nHaving been prevented from retaining my collection of the acts and\r\njournals of our legislature by the lumping manner in which the Committee\r\nof Congress chose to take my library, it may be useful to our public\r\nbodies to know what acts and journals I had, and where they can now\r\nhave access to them. I therefore enclose you a copy of my catalogue,\r\nwhich I pray you to deposit in the council office for public use. It\r\nis in the eighteenth and twenty-fourth chapters they will find what is\r\ninteresting to them. The form of the catalogue has been much injured\r\nin the publication; for although they have preserved my division into\r\nchapters, they have reduced the books in each chapter to alphabetical\r\norder, instead of the chronological or analytical arrangements I had\r\ngiven them. You will see sketches of what were my arrangements at the\r\nheads of some of the chapters.\r\n\r\nThe bill on the obstructions in our navigable waters appears to me\r\nproper; as do also the amendments proposed. I think the State should\r\nreserve a right to the use of the waters for navigation, and that\r\nwhere an individual landholder impedes that use, he shall remove that\r\nimpediment, and leave the subject in as good a state as nature formed\r\nit. This I hold to be the true principle; and to this Colonel Green's\r\namendments go. All I ask in my own case is, that the legislature will\r\nnot take from me _my own works_. I am ready to cut my dam in any place,\r\nand at any moment requisite, so as to remove that impediment, if it be\r\nthought one, and to leave those interested to make the most of the natural\r\ncircumstances of the place. But I hope they will never take from me my\r\ncanal, made through the body of my own lands, at an expense of twenty\r\nthousand dollars, and which is no impediment to the navigation of the\r\nriver. I have permitted the riparian proprietors above (and they not\r\nmore than a dozen or twenty) to use it gratis, and shall not withdraw the\r\npermission unless they so use it as to obstruct too much the operations\r\nof my mills, of which there is some likelihood.\r\n\r\nDoctor Smith, you say, asks what is the best elementary book on the\r\nprinciples of government? None in the world equal to the Review of\r\nMontesquieu, printed at Philadelphia a few years ago. It has the\r\nadvantage, too, of being equally sound and corrective of the principles of\r\npolitical economy; and all within the compass of a thin 8vo. Chipman's and\r\nPriestley's Principles of Government, and the Federalists, are excellent\r\nin many respects, but for fundamental principles not comparable to the\r\nReview. I have no objections to the printing my letter to Mr. Carr, if\r\nit will promote the interests of science; although it was not written\r\nwith a view to its publication.\r\n\r\nMy letter of the 24th ult. conveyed to you the grounds of the two\r\narticles objected to in the College bill. Your last presents one of them\r\nin a new point of view, that of the commencement of the ward schools\r\nas likely to render the law unpopular to the country. It must be a very\r\ninconsiderate and rough process of execution that would do this. My idea\r\nof the mode of carrying it into execution would be this: Declare the\r\ncounty _ipso facto_ divided into wards for the present, by the boundaries\r\nof the militia captaincies; somebody attend the ordinary muster of each\r\ncompany, having first desired the captain to call together a full one.\r\nThere explain the object of the law to the people of the company, put\r\nto their vote whether they will have a school established, and the most\r\ncentral and convenient place for it; get them to meet and build a log\r\nschool-house; have a roll taken of the children who would attend it,\r\nand of those of them able to pay. These would probably be sufficient to\r\nsupport a common teacher, instructing gratis the few unable to pay. If\r\nthere should be a deficiency, it would require too trifling a contribution\r\nfrom the county to be complained of; and especially as the whole county\r\nwould participate, where necessary, in the same resource. Should the\r\ncompany, by its vote, decide that it would have no school, let them\r\nremain without one. The advantages of this proceeding would be that it\r\nwould become the duty of the alderman elected by the county, to take\r\nan active part in pressing the introduction of schools, and to look out\r\nfor tutors. If, however, it is intended that the State government shall\r\ntake this business into its own hands, and provide schools for every\r\ncounty, then by all means strike out this provision of our bill. I would\r\nnever wish that it should be placed on a worse footing than the rest of\r\nthe State. But if it is believed that these elementary schools will be\r\nbetter managed by the governor and council, the commissioners of the\r\nliterary fund, or any other general authority of the government, than\r\nby the parents within each ward, it is a belief against all experience.\r\nTry the principle one step further, and amend the bill so as to commit\r\nto the governor and council the management of all our farms, our mills,\r\nand merchants' stores. No, my friend, the way to have good and safe\r\ngovernment, is not to trust it all to one, but to divide it among the\r\nmany, distributing to every one exactly the functions he is competent\r\nto. Let the national government be entrusted with the defence of the\r\nnation, and its foreign and federal relations; the State governments with\r\nthe civil rights, laws, police, and administration of what concerns the\r\nState generally; the counties with the local concerns of the counties,\r\nand each ward direct the interests within itself. It is by dividing and\r\nsubdividing these republics from the great national one down through\r\nall its subordinations, until it ends in the administration of every\r\nman's farm by himself; by placing under every one what his own eye may\r\nsuperintend, that all will be done for the best. What has destroyed\r\nliberty and the rights of man in every government which has ever existed\r\nunder the sun? The generalizing and concentrating all cares and powers\r\ninto one body, no matter whether of the autocrats of Russia or France,\r\nor of the aristocrats of a Venetian senate. And I do believe that if\r\nthe Almighty has not decreed that man shall never be free, (and it is\r\na blasphemy to believe it,) that the secret will be found to be in the\r\nmaking himself the depository of the powers respecting himself, so far as\r\nhe is competent to them, and delegating only what is beyond his competence\r\nby a synthetical process, to higher and higher orders of functionaries, so\r\nas to trust fewer and fewer powers in proportion as the trustees become\r\nmore and more oligarchical. The elementary republics of the wards, the\r\ncounty republics, the State republics, and the republic of the Union,\r\nwould form a gradation of authorities, standing each on the basis of\r\nlaw, holding every one its delegated share of powers, and constituting\r\ntruly a system of fundamental balances and checks for the government.\r\nWhere every man is a sharer in the direction of his ward-republic, or\r\nof some of the higher ones, and feels that he is a participator in the\r\ngovernment of affairs, not merely at an election one day in the year,\r\nbut every day; when there shall not be a man in the State who will not\r\nbe a member of some one of its councils, great or small, he will let\r\nthe heart be torn out of his body sooner than his power be wrested from\r\nhim by a Cæsar or a Bonaparte. How powerfully did we feel the energy of\r\nthis organization in the case of embargo? I felt the foundations of the\r\ngovernment shaken under my feet by the New England townships. There was\r\nnot an individual in their States whose body was not thrown with all\r\nits momentum into action; and although the whole of the other States\r\nwere known to be in favor of the measure, yet the organization of this\r\nlittle selfish minority enabled it to overrule the Union. What would\r\nthe unwieldy counties of the middle, the south, and the west do? Call a\r\ncounty meeting, and the drunken loungers at and about the court houses\r\nwould have collected, the distances being too great for the good people\r\nand the industrious generally to attend. The character of those who\r\nreally met would have been the measure of the weight they would have had\r\nin the scale of public opinion. As Cato, then, concluded every speech\r\nwith the words, \"_Carthago delenda est_,\" so do I every opinion, with\r\nthe injunction, \"divide the counties into wards.\" Begin them only for\r\na single purpose; they will soon show for what others they are the best\r\ninstruments. God bless you, and all our rulers, and give them the wisdom,\r\nas I am sure they have the will, to fortify us against the degeneracy\r\nof one government, and the concentration of all its powers in the hands\r\nof the one, the few, the well-born or the many.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS TO THOMAS JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n                                                  QUINCY, February 2, 1816.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I know not what to think of your letter of the 11th of January,\r\nbut that it is one of the most consolatory I ever received.\r\n\r\nTo trace the commencement of the Reformation, I suspect we must go\r\nfarther back than Borgia, or even Huss or Wickliff, and I want the _Acta\r\nSanctorum_ to assist me in this research. That stupendous monument of\r\nhuman hypocrisy and fanaticism, the church of St. Peter at Rome, which\r\nwas a century and a half in building, excited the ambition of Leo the\r\nXth, who believed no more of the Christian religion than Diderot, to\r\nfinish it; and finding St. Peter's pence insufficient, he deluged all\r\nEurope with indulgences for sale, and excited Luther to controvert his\r\nauthority to grant them. Luther, and his associates and followers, went\r\nless than half way in detecting the corruptions of Christianity, but\r\nthey acquired reverence and authority among their followers almost as\r\nabsolute as that of the Popes had been.\r\n\r\nTo enter into details would be endless; but I agree with you, that the\r\nnatural effect of science and arts is to erect public opinion into a\r\ncensor, which must in some degree be respected by all.\r\n\r\nThere is no difference of opinion or feeling between us, concerning the\r\npartition of Poland, the intended partitions of Pilnitz, or the more\r\ndaring partitions of Vienna.\r\n\r\nYour question \"How the apostasy from national rectitude can be accounted\r\nfor?\"--is too deep and wide for my capacity to answer. I leave Fisher Ames\r\nto dogmatize up the affairs of Europe and mankind. I have done too much\r\nin this way. A burned child dreads the fire. I can only say at present,\r\nthat it should seem that human reason, and human conscience, though I\r\nbelieve there are such things, are not a match for human passions, human\r\nimaginations, and human enthusiasm. You, however, I believe, have hit\r\none. Mark, \"the fires the governments of Europe felt kindling under their\r\nseats;\" and I will hazard a shot at another, the priests of all nations\r\nimagined they felt approaching such flames, as they had so often kindled\r\nabout the bodies of honest men. Priests and politicians, never before,\r\nso suddenly and so unanimously concurred in re-establishing darkness\r\nand ignorance, superstition and despotism. The morality of Tacitus is\r\nthe morality of patriotism, and Britain and France have adopted his\r\ncreed; _i. e._, that all things were made for Rome. \"_Jura negat sibi\r\nlata, nihil non arrogat armis_,\" said Achilles. \"Laws were not made for\r\nme,\" said the Regent of France, and his cardinal minister Du Bois. The\r\nuniverse was made for me, says man. Jesus despised and condemned such\r\npatriotism; but what nation, or what christian, has adopted his system?\r\nHe was, as you say, \"the most benevolent Being that ever appeared on\r\nearth.\" France and England, Bourbons and Bonaparte, and all the sovereigns\r\nat Vienna, have acted on the same principle. \"All things were made for\r\nmy use. So man for mine, replies a pampered goose.\" The philosophers of\r\nthe eighteenth century have acted on the same principle. When it is to\r\ncombat evil, 'tis lawful to employ the devil. _Bonus populus vult decipi,\r\ndecipiatur._ They have employed the same falsehood, the same deceit,\r\nwhich philosophers and priests of all ages have employed for their own\r\nselfish purposes. We now know how their efforts have succeeded. The\r\nold deceivers have triumphed over the new. Truth must be more respected\r\nthan it has ever been, before any great improvement can be expected in\r\nthe condition of mankind. As Rochfaucauld his maxims drew \"from history\r\nand from practice,\" I believe them true. From the whole nature of man,\r\nmoral, intellectual, and physical, he did not draw them.\r\n\r\nWe must come to the principles of Jesus. But when will all men and\r\nall nations do as they would be done by? Forgive all injuries, and\r\nlove their enemies as themselves? I leave those profound philosophers,\r\nwhose sagacity perceives the perfectibility of human nature; and those\r\nilluminated theologians, who expect the Apocalyptic reign;--to enjoy\r\ntheir transporting hopes, provided always that they will not engage us\r\nin crusades and French Revolutions, nor burn us for doubting. My spirit\r\nof prophecy reaches no farther than, _New England_ GUESSES.\r\n\r\nYou ask, how it has happened that all Europe has acted on the principle,\r\n\"that Power was Right.\" I know not what answer to give you, but this,\r\nthat Power always sincerely, conscientiously, _de tres bon foi_, believes\r\nitself right. Power always thinks it has a great soul, and vast views,\r\nbeyond the comprehension of the weak; and that it is doing God service,\r\nwhen it is violating all his laws. Our passions, ambition, avarice,\r\nlove, resentment, &c., possess so much metaphysical subtlety, and so\r\nmuch overpowering eloquence, that they insinuate themselves into the\r\nunderstanding and the conscience, and convert both to their party; and\r\nI may be deceived as much as any of them, when I say, that Power must\r\nnever be trusted without a check.\r\n\r\nMorgan has misrepresented my guess. There is not a word in my letter\r\nabout \"a million of human beings.\" Civil wars, of an hundred years,\r\nthroughout Europe, were guessed at; and this is broad enough for your\r\nideas; for eighteen or twenty millions would be a moderate computation\r\nfor a century of civil wars throughout Europe. I still pray that a century\r\nof civil wars, may not desolate Europe and America too, south and north.\r\n\r\nYour speculations into futurity in Europe are so probable, that I can\r\nsuggest no doubt to their disadvantage. All will depend on the progress of\r\nknowledge. But how shall knowledge advance? Independent of temporal and\r\nspiritual power, the course of science and literature is obstructed and\r\ndiscouraged by so many causes that it is to be feared their motions will\r\nbe slow. I have just finished reading four volumes of D'Israeli's--two\r\non the \"Calamities,\" and two on the \"Quarrels of Authors.\" These would\r\nbe sufficient to show that, slow rises genius by poverty and envy\r\noppressed. Even Newton, and Locke, and Grotius could not escape. France\r\ncould furnish four other volumes of the woes and wars of authors.\r\n\r\nMy compliments to Mrs. Randolph, her daughter Ellen, and all her other\r\nchildren; and believe me, as ever.\r\n\r\nTo which Mrs. Adams adds her affectionate regard, and a wish that distance\r\ndid not separate souls congenial.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THOMAS W. MAURY.\r\n\r\n                                              MONTICELLO, February 3, 1816.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of the 24th ultimo was a week on its way to me,\r\nand this is our first subsequent mail day. Mr. Cabell had written to\r\nme also on the want of the deeds in Captain Miller's case; and as the\r\nbill was in that house, I enclosed them immediately to him. I forgot,\r\nhowever, to desire that they might be returned when done with, and must,\r\ntherefore, ask this friendly attention of you.\r\n\r\nYou ask me for observations on the memorandum you transcribe, relating\r\nto a map of the States, a mineralogical survey and statistical tables.\r\nThe field is very broad, and new to me. I have never turned my mind to\r\nthis combination of objects, nor am I at all prepared to give an opinion\r\non it. On what principles the association of objects may go that far and\r\nnot farther, whether we could find a character who would undertake the\r\nmineralogical survey, and who is qualified for it, whether there would\r\nbe room for its designations on a well-filled geographical map, and\r\nalso for the statistical details, I cannot say. The best mineralogical\r\ncharts I have seen, have had nothing geographical but the water courses,\r\nranges of hills, and most remarkable places, and have been colored,\r\nso as to present to the eye the mineralogical ranges. For the articles\r\nof a statistical table, I think the last census of Congress presented\r\nwhat was proper, as far as it went, but did not go far enough. It\r\nrequired detailed accounts of our manufactures, and an enumeration of\r\nour people, according to ages, sexes, and colors. But to this should be\r\nadded an enumeration according to their occupations. We should know what\r\nproportion of our people are employed in agriculture, what proportion\r\nare carpenters, smiths, shoemakers, tailors, bricklayers, merchants,\r\nseamen, &c. No question is more curious than that of the distribution of\r\nsociety into occupations, and none more wanting. I have never heard of\r\nsuch tables being effected but in the instance of Spain, where it was\r\nfirst done under the administration, I believe, of Count D'Aranda, and\r\na second time under the Count de Florida Blanca, and these have been\r\nconsidered as the most curious and valuable tables in the world. The\r\ncombination of callings with us would occasion some difficulty, many of\r\nour tradesmen being, for instance, agriculturalists also; but they might\r\nbe classed under their principal occupation. On the geographical branch\r\nI have reflected occasionally. I suppose a person would be employed in\r\nevery county to put together the private surveys, either taken from the\r\nsurveyors' books or borrowed from the proprietors, to connect them by\r\nsupplementary surveys, and to survey the public roads, noting towns,\r\nhabitations, and remarkable places, by which means a special delineation\r\nof watercourses, roads, &c., will be obtained. But it will be further\r\nindispensable to obtain the latitudes and longitudes of principal points\r\nin every county, in order to correct the errors of the topographical\r\nsurveys, to bring them together, and to assign to each county its exact\r\nspace on the map. These observations of latitude and longitude might be\r\ntaken for the whole State, by a single person well qualified, in the\r\ncourse of a couple of years. I could offer some ideas on that subject\r\nto abridge and facilitate the operations, and as to the instruments\r\nto be used; but such details are probably not within the scope of your\r\ninquiries,--they would be in time if communicated to those who will have\r\nthe direction of the work. I am sorry I am so little prepared to offer\r\nanything more satisfactory to your inquiries than these extempore hints.\r\nBut I have no doubt that what is best will occur to those gentlemen of\r\nthe legislature who have had the subject under their contemplation, and\r\nwho, impressed with its importance, are exerting themselves to procure\r\nits execution. Accept the assurance of my great esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, February 4, 1816\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your letter concerning that of General Scott is received, and\r\nhis is now returned. I am very thankful for these communications. From\r\nforty years' experience of the wretched guess-work of the newspapers\r\nof what is not done in open daylight, and of their falsehood even as\r\nto that, I rarely think them worth reading, and almost never worth\r\nnotice. A ray, therefore, now and then, from the fountain of light, is\r\nlike sight restored to the blind. It tells me where I am; and that to a\r\nmariner who has long been without sight of land or sun, is a rallying\r\nof reckoning which places him at ease. The ground you have taken with\r\nSpain is sound in every part. It is the true ground, especially, as to\r\nthe South Americans. When subjects are able to maintain themselves in\r\nthe field, they are then an independent power as to all neutral nations,\r\nare entitled to their commerce, and to protection within their limits.\r\nEvery kindness which can be shown the South Americans, every friendly\r\noffice and aid within the limits of the law of nations, I would extend\r\nto them, without fearing Spain or her Swiss auxiliaries. For this is\r\nbut an assertion of our own independence. But to join in their war, as\r\nGeneral Scott proposes, and to which even some members of Congress seem\r\nto squint, is what we ought not to do as yet. On the question of our\r\ninterest in their independence, were that alone a sufficient motive of\r\naction, much may be said on both sides. When they are free, they will\r\ndrive every article of our produce from every market, by underselling\r\nit, and change the condition of our existence, forcing us into other\r\nhabits and pursuits. We shall, indeed, have in exchange some commerce\r\nwith them, but in what I know not, for we shall have nothing to offer\r\nwhich they cannot raise cheaper; and their separation from Spain seals\r\nour everlasting peace with her. On the other hand, so long as they are\r\ndependent, Spain, from her jealousy, is our natural enemy, and always in\r\neither open or secret hostility with us. These countries, too, in war,\r\nwill be a powerful weight in her scale, and, in peace, totally shut to us.\r\nInterest then, on the whole, would wish their independence, and justice\r\nmakes the wish a duty. They have a right to be free, and we a right to\r\naid them, as a strong man has a right to assist a weak one assailed by\r\na robber or murderer. That a war is brewing between us and Spain cannot\r\nbe doubted. When that disposition is matured on both sides, and open\r\nrupture can no longer be deferred, then will be the time for our joining\r\nthe South Americans, and entering into treaties of alliance with them.\r\nThere will then be but one opinion, at home or abroad, that we shall be\r\njustifiable in choosing to have them with us, rather than against us. In\r\nthe meantime, they will have organized regular governments, and perhaps\r\nhave formed themselves into one or more confederacies; more than one I\r\nhope, as in single mass they would be a very formidable neighbor. The\r\ngeography of their country seems to indicate three: 1. What is north of\r\nthe Isthmus. 2. What is south of it on the Atlantic; and 3. The southern\r\npart on the Pacific. In this form, we might be the balancing power. _À\r\npropos_ of the dispute with Spain, as to the boundary of Louisiana. On our\r\nacquisition of that country, there was found in possession of the family\r\nof the late Governor Messier, a most valuable and original MS. history\r\nof the settlement of Louisiana by the French, written by Bernard de la\r\nHarpe, a principal agent through the whole of it. It commences with the\r\nfirst permanent settlement of 1699, (that by de la Salle in 1684, having\r\nbeen broken up,) and continues to 1723, and shows clearly the continual\r\nclaim of France to the Province of Texas, as far as the Rio Bravo, and\r\nto all the waters running into the Mississippi, and how, by the roguery\r\nof St. Denis, an agent of Crozat the merchant, to whom the colony was\r\ngranted for ten years, the settlements of the Spaniards at Nacadoches,\r\nAdais, Assinays, and Natchitoches, were fraudulently invited and connived\r\nat. Crozat's object was commerce, and especially contraband, with the\r\nSpaniards, and these posts were settled as convenient smuggling stages\r\non the way to Mexico. The history bears such marks of authenticity as\r\nplace it beyond question. Governor Claiborne obtained the MS. for us,\r\nand thinking it too hazardous to risk its loss by the way, unless a copy\r\nwere retained, he had a copy taken. The original having arrived safe\r\nat Washington, he sent me the copy, which I now have. Is the original\r\nstill in your office? or was it among the papers burnt by the British?\r\nIf lost, I will send you my copy; if preserved, it is my wish to deposit\r\nthe copy for safe keeping with the Philosophical Society at Philadelphia,\r\nwhere it will be safer than on my shelves. I do not mean that any part\r\nof this letter shall give to yourself the trouble of an answer; only\r\ndesire Mr. Graham to see if the original still exists in your office,\r\nand to drop me a line saying yea or nay; and I shall know what to do.\r\nIndeed the MS. ought to be printed, and I see a note to my copy which\r\nshows it has been in contemplation, and that it was computed to be of\r\ntwenty sheets at sixteen dollars a sheet, for three hundred and twenty\r\ncopies, which would sell at one dollar apiece, and reimburse the expense.\r\n\r\nOn the question of giving to La Motte the consulship of Havre, I know\r\nthe obstacle of the Senate. Their determination to appoint natives only\r\nis generally proper, but not always. These places are for the most part\r\nof little consequence to the public; and if they can be made resources\r\nof profit to our ex-military worthies, they are so far advantageous. You\r\nand I, however, know that one of these new novices, knowing nothing of\r\nthe laws or authorities of his port, nor speaking a word of its language,\r\nis of no more account than the fifth wheel of a coach. Had the Senate a\r\npower of removing as well as of rejecting, I should have fears, from their\r\nforeign antipathies, for my old friend Cathalan, Consul at Marseilles.\r\nHis father was appointed by Dr. Franklin, early in the revolutionary war,\r\nbut being old, the business was done by the son. On the establishment of\r\nour present government, the commission was given by General Washington\r\nto the son, at the request of the father. He has been the consul now\r\ntwenty-six years, and has done its duties nearly forty years. He is a\r\nman of understanding, integrity and zeal, of high mercantile standing,\r\nan early citizen of the United States, and speaks and writes our language\r\nas fluently as French. His conduct in office has been without a fault. I\r\nhave known him personally and intimately for thirty years, have a great\r\nand affectionate esteem for him, and should feel as much hurt were he\r\nto be removed as if removed myself from an office. But I trust he is out\r\nof the reach of the Senate, and secure under the wings of the executive\r\ngovernment. Let me recommend him to your particular care and patronage,\r\nas well deserving it, and end the trouble of reading a long letter with\r\nassurances of my constant and affectionate friendship.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO BENJAMIN AUSTIN, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                              MONTICELLO, February 9, 1816.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your favor of January 25th is just now received. I am in general\r\nextremely unwilling to be carried into the newspapers, no matter what\r\nthe subject; the whole pack of the Essex kennel would open upon me. With\r\nrespect, however, to so much of my letter of January 9th as relates to\r\nmanufactures, I have less repugnance, because there is perhaps a degree of\r\nduty to avow a change of opinion called for by a change of circumstances,\r\nand especially on a point now become peculiarly interesting.\r\n\r\nWhat relates to Bonaparte stands on different ground. You think it\r\nwill silence the misrepresentations of my enemies as to my opinions of\r\nhim. No, Sir; it will not silence them. They had no ground either in my\r\nwords or actions for these misrepresentations before, and cannot have\r\nless afterwards; nor will they calumniate less. There is, however, a\r\nconsideration respecting our own friends, which may merit attention. I\r\nhave grieved to see even good republicans so infatuated as to this man,\r\nas to consider his downfall as calamitous to the cause of liberty. In\r\ntheir indignation against England which is just, they seem to consider\r\nall _her_ enemies as _our_ friends, when it is well known there was\r\nnot a being on earth who bore us so deadly a hatred. In fact, he saw\r\nnothing in this world but himself, and looked on the people under him as\r\nhis cattle, beasts for burthen and slaughter. Promises cost him nothing\r\nwhen they could serve his purpose. On his return from Elba, what did he\r\nnot promise? But those who had credited them a little, soon saw their\r\ntotal insignificance, and, satisfied they could not fall under worse\r\nhands, refused every effort after the defeat of Waterloo. Their present\r\nsufferings will have a term; his iron despotism would have had none.\r\nFrance has now a family of fools at its head, from whom, whenever it\r\ncan shake off its foreign riders, it will extort a free constitution,\r\nor dismount them and establish some other on the solid basis of national\r\nright. To whine after this exorcised demon is a disgrace to republicans,\r\nand must have arisen either from want of reflection, or the indulgence\r\nof passion against principle. If anything I have said could lead them\r\nto take correcter views, to rally to the polar principles of genuine\r\nrepublicanism, I could consent that that part of my letter also should\r\ngo into a newspaper. This I leave to yourself and such candid friends\r\nas you may consult. There is one word in the letter, however, which\r\ndecency towards the allied sovereigns requires should be softened.\r\nInstead of _despots_, call them _rulers_. The first paragraph, too, of\r\nseven or eight lines, must be wholly omitted. Trusting all the rest to\r\nyour discretion, I salute you with great esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS TO THOMAS JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n                                                     QUINCY, March 2, 1816.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I cannot be serious! I am about to write you the most frivolous\r\nletter you ever read.\r\n\r\nWould you go back to your cradle and live over again your seventy years?\r\nI believe you would return me a New England answer, by asking me another\r\nquestion. Would you live your eighty years over again?\r\n\r\nI am prepared to give you an explicit answer, the question involves so\r\nmany considerations of metaphysics and physics, of theology and ethics,\r\nof philosophy and history, of experience and romance, of tragedy, comedy\r\nand farce, that I would not give my opinion without writing a volume to\r\njustify it.\r\n\r\nI have lately lived over again, in part, from 1753, when I was junior\r\nsophister at college, till 1769, when I was digging in the mines as a\r\nbarrister at law, for silver and gold, in the town of Boston; and got\r\nas much of the shining dross for my labor as my utmost avarice at that\r\ntime craved.\r\n\r\nAt the hazard of all the little vision that is left me, I have read the\r\nhistory of that period of sixteen years, in the volumes of the Baron de\r\nGrimm. In a late letter to you, I expressed a wish to see a history of\r\nquarrels and calamities of authors in France, like that of D'Israeli in\r\nEngland. I did not expect it so soon; but now I have it in a manner more\r\nmasterly than I ever hoped to see it. It is not only a narration of the\r\nincessant great wars between the ecclesiastics and the philosophers, but\r\nof the little skirmishes and squabbles of Poets, Musicians, Sculptors,\r\nPainters, Architects, Tragedians, Comedians, Opera-Singers and Dancers,\r\nChansons, Vaudevilles, Epigrams, Madrigals, Epitaphs, Anagrams, Sonnets,\r\n&c. No man is more sensible than I am of the service to science and\r\nletters, Humanity, Fraternity and Liberty, that would have been rendered\r\nby the Encyclopedists and Economists, by Voltaire, D'Alembert, Buffon,\r\nDiderot, Rousseau La Lande, Frederick and Catherine, if they had possessed\r\ncommon sense. But they were all totally destitute of it. They all seemed\r\nto think that all christendom was convinced as they were, that all\r\nreligion was \"visions Judaicques,\" and that their effulgent lights had\r\nilluminated all the world. They seemed to believe, that whole nations\r\nand continents had been changed in their principles, opinions, habits\r\nand feelings, by the sovereign grace of their Almighty philosophy,\r\nalmost as suddenly as Catholics and Calvinists believe in instantaneous\r\nconversion. They had not considered the force of early education on the\r\nmillions of minds who had never heard of their philosophy. And what\r\nwas their philosophy? Atheism; pure, unadulterated Atheism. Diderot,\r\nD'Alembert, Frederick, De La Lande and Grimm, were indubitable Atheists.\r\nThe universe was matter only, and eternal; spirit was a word without a\r\nmeaning; liberty was a word without a meaning. There was no liberty in\r\nthe Universe; liberty was a word void of sense. Every thought, word,\r\npassion, sentiment, feeling, all motion and action was necessary. All\r\nbeings and attributes were of eternal necessity; conscience, morality,\r\nwere all nothing but fate.\r\n\r\nThis was their creed, and this was to perfect human nature, and convert\r\nthe earth into a paradise of pleasure.\r\n\r\nWho, and what is this fate? He must be a sensible fellow. He must be\r\na master of science. He must be a master of spherical Trigonometry\r\nand great circle sailing. He must calculate eclipses in his head by\r\nintuition. He must be master of the science of infinitesimal--\"_Le science\r\ndes infinimens petits_.\" He must involve and extract all the roots by\r\nintuition, and be familiar with all possible or imaginable sections of\r\nthe cone. He must be a master of arts, mechanical and imitative. He must\r\nhave more eloquence than Demosthenes, more wit than Swift or Voltaire,\r\nmore humor than Butler or Trumbull, and what is more comfortable than\r\nall the rest, he must be good natured; for this is upon the whole a good\r\nworld. There is ten times as much pleasure as pain in it.\r\n\r\nWhy then should we abhor the word God, and fall in love with the word\r\nFate? We know there exists energy and intellect enough to produce\r\nsuch a world as this, which is a sublime and beautiful one, and a very\r\nbenevolent one, notwithstanding all our snarling; and a happy one, if\r\nit is not made otherwise by our own fault. Ask a mite, in the centre of\r\nyour mammoth cheese, what he thinks of the \"το παν.\"\r\n\r\nI should prefer the philosophy of Timæus, of Locris, before that of\r\nGrimm and Diderot, Frederick and D'Alembert. I should even prefer the\r\nShasta of Hindostan, or the Chaldean, Egyptian, Indian, Greek, Christian,\r\nMahometan, Tubonic, or Celtic Theology. Timæus and Picellus taught that\r\nthree principles were eternal, God, Matter and Form. God was good, and\r\nhad ideas. Matter was necessity. Fate dead--without ideas--without form,\r\nwithout feeling--perverse, untractable; capable, however, of being cut\r\ninto forms, spheres, circles, triangles, squares, cubes, cones, &c. The\r\nideas of the good God labored upon matter to bring it into form; but\r\nmatter was fate, necessity, dulness, obstinacy--and would not always\r\nconform to the ideas of the good God who desired to make the best of\r\nall possible worlds; but Matter, Fate, Necessity, resisted, and would\r\nnot let him complete his idea. Hence all the evil and disorder, pain,\r\nmisery and imperfection of the Universe.\r\n\r\nWe all curse Robespierre and Bonaparte, but were they not both such\r\nrestless, vain, extravagant animals as Diderot and Voltaire? Voltaire\r\nwas the greatest literary character, and Bonaparte the greatest military\r\ncharacter of the eighteenth century. There is all the difference between\r\nthem. Both equally heroes and equally cowards.\r\n\r\nWhen you ask my opinion of a University--it would have been easy to advise\r\nMathematics, experimental Philosophy, Natural History, Chemistry and\r\nAstronomy, Geography and the Fine Arts; to the exclusion of Metaphysics\r\nand Theology. But knowing the eager impatience of the human mind to\r\nsearch into eternity and infinity, the first cause and last end of all\r\nthings--I thought best to leave it its liberty to inquire till it is\r\nconvinced, as I have been these fifty years, that there is but one Being\r\nin the Universe who comprehends it; and our last resource is resignation.\r\n\r\nThis Grimm must have been in Paris when you were there. Did you know\r\nhim, or hear of him?\r\n\r\nI have this moment received two volumes more, but these are from 1777\r\nto 1782,--leaving the chain broken from 1769 to 1777. I hope hereafter\r\nto get the two intervening volumes. I am your old friend.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                            March 13, 1816.\r\n\r\nA writer in the National Intelligencer of February 24th, who signs\r\nhimself B., is endeavoring to shelter under the cloak of General\r\nWashington, the present enterprise of the Senate to wrest from the\r\nHouse of Representatives the power, given them by the constitution, of\r\nparticipating with the Senate in the establishment and continuance of\r\nlaws on specified subjects. Their aim is, by associating an Indian chief,\r\nor foreign government, in form of a treaty, to possess themselves of the\r\npower of repealing laws become obnoxious to them, without the assent of\r\nthe third branch, although that assent was necessary to make it a law.\r\nWe are then to depend for the secure possession of our laws, not on our\r\nimmediate representatives chosen by ourselves, and amenable to ourselves\r\nevery other year, but on Senators chosen by the legislatures, amenable\r\nto them only, and that but at intervals of six years, which is nearly\r\nthe common estimate for a term for life. But no act of that sainted\r\nworthy, no thought of General Washington, ever countenanced a change of\r\nour constitution so vital as would be the rendering insignificant the\r\npopular, and giving to the aristocratical branch of our government, the\r\npower of depriving us of our laws.\r\n\r\nThe case for which General Washington is quoted is that of his treaty\r\nwith the Creeks, wherein was a stipulation that their supplies of goods\r\nshould continue to be imported duty free. The writer of this article\r\nwas then a member of the legislature, as he was of that which afterwards\r\ndiscussed the British treaty, and recollects the facts of the day, and\r\nthe ideas which were afloat. The goods for the supplies of the Creeks\r\nwere always imported into the Spanish ports of St. Augustine, Pensacola,\r\nMobile, New Orleans, &c., (the United States not owning then one foot\r\nof coast on the gulf of Mexico, or south of St. Mary's,) and from these\r\nports they were carried directly into the Creek country, without ever\r\nentering the jurisdiction of the United States. In that country their\r\nlaws pretended to no more force than in Florida or Canada. No officer of\r\ntheir customs could go to levy duties in the Spanish or Creek countries,\r\nout of which these goods never came. General Washington's stipulation in\r\nthat treaty therefore, was nothing more than that our laws should not\r\nlevy duties where we have no right to levy them, that is, in foreign\r\nports, or foreign countries. These transactions took place while the\r\nCreek deputation was in New York, in the month of July 1790, and in March\r\npreceding we had passed a law delineating specially the line between\r\ntheir country and ours. The only subject of curiosity is how so nugatory\r\na stipulation should have been placed in a treaty? It was from the fears\r\nof Mr. Gillevray, who was the head of the deputation, who possessed from\r\nthe Creeks themselves the exclusive right to supply them with goods,\r\nand to whom this monopoly was the principle source of income.\r\n\r\nThe same writer quotes from a note in Marshal's history, an opinion of\r\nMr. Jefferson, given to General Washington on the same occasion of the\r\nCreek treaty. Two or three little lines only of that opinion are given\r\nus, which do indeed express the doctrine in broad and general terms. Yet\r\nwe know how often a few words withdrawn from their place may seem to bear\r\na general meaning, when their context would show that their meaning must\r\nhave been limited to the subject with respect to which they were used.\r\nIf we could see the whole opinion, it might probably appear that its\r\nfoundation was the peculiar circumstances of the Creek nation. We may\r\nsay too, on this opinion, as on that of a judge whose positions beyond\r\nthe limits of the case before him are considered as obiter sayings,\r\nnever to be relied on as authority.\r\n\r\nIn July '90, moreover, the government was but just getting under way.\r\nThe duty law was not passed until the succeeding month of August. This\r\nquestion of the effect of a treaty was then of the first impression;\r\nand none of us, I suppose, will pretend that on our first reading of the\r\nconstitution we saw at once all its intentions, all the bearings of every\r\nword of it, as fully and as correctly as we have since understood them,\r\nafter they have become subjects of public investigation and discussion;\r\nand I well remember the fact that, although Mr. Jefferson had retired\r\nfrom office before Mr. Jay's mission, and the question on the British\r\ntreaty, yet during its discussion we were well assured of his entire\r\nconcurrence in opinion with Mr. Madison and others who maintained the\r\nrights of the House of Representatives, so that, if on a _primâ facie_\r\nview of the question, his opinion had been too general, on stricter\r\ninvestigation, and more mature consideration, his ultimate opinion was\r\nwith those who thought that the subjects which were confided to the\r\nHouse of Representatives in conjunction with the President and Senate,\r\nwere exceptions to the general treaty power given to the President and\r\nSenate alone; (according to the general rule that an instrument is to\r\nbe so construed as to reconcile and give meaning and effect to all its\r\nparts;) that whenever a treaty stipulation interferes with a law of the\r\nthree branches, the consent of the third branch is necessary to give\r\nit effect; and that there is to this but the single exception of the\r\nquestion of war and peace. There the constitution expressly requires\r\nthe concurrence of the three branches to commit us to the state of war,\r\nbut permits two of them, the President and Senate, to change it to that\r\nof peace, for reasons as obvious as they are wise. I think then I may\r\naffirm, in contradiction to B., that the present attempt of the Senate\r\nis not sanctioned by the opinion either of General Washington or of Mr.\r\nJefferson.\r\n\r\nI meant to confine myself to the case of the Creek treaty, and not to\r\ngo into the general reasoning, for after the logical and demonstrative\r\narguments of Mr. Wilde of Georgia, and others on the floor of Congress,\r\nif any man remains unconvinced I pretend not the powers of convincing him.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR NICHOLAS.\r\n\r\n                                                 MONTICELLO, April 2, 1816.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of March 22d has been received. It finds me\r\nmore laboriously and imperiously engaged than almost on any occasion\r\nof my life. It is not, therefore, in my power to take into immediate\r\nconsideration all the subjects it proposes; they cover a broad surface,\r\nand will require some development. They respect,\r\n\r\nI. Defence.\r\n\r\nII. Education.\r\n\r\nIII. The map of the State.\r\n\r\nThis last will comprise,\r\n\r\n1. An astronomical survey, to wit, Longitudes and Latitudes.\r\n\r\n2. A geometrical survey of the external boundaries, the mountains and\r\nrivers.\r\n\r\n3. A typographical survey of the counties.\r\n\r\n4. A mineralogical survey.\r\n\r\nEach of these heads require distinct consideration. I will take them up\r\none at a time, and communicate my ideas as leisure will permit.\r\n\r\nI. On the subject of Defence, I will state to you what has been heretofore\r\ncontemplated and proposed. Some time before I retired from office, when\r\nthe clouds between England and the United States thickened so as to\r\nthreaten war at hand, and while we were fortifying various assailable\r\npoints on our sea-board, the defence of the Chesapeake became, as it\r\nought to have been, a subject of serious consideration, and the problem\r\noccurred, whether it could be defended at its mouth? its effectual defence\r\nin detail being obviously impossible. My idea was that we should find\r\nor prepare a station near its mouth for a very great force of vessels of\r\nannoyance of such a character as to assail, when the weather and position\r\nof an enemy suited, and keep or withdraw themselves into their station\r\nwhen adverse. These means of annoyance were to consist of gun-boats,\r\nrow-boats, floating batteries, bomb-ketches, fire-ships, rafts, turtles,\r\ntorpedoes, rockets, and whatever else could be desired to destroy a\r\nship becalmed, to which could now be added Fulton scows. I thought it\r\npossible that a station might be made on the middle grounds, (which\r\nare always shallow, and have been known to be uncovered by water,) by a\r\ncircumvallation of stones dropped loosely on one another, so as to take\r\ntheir own level, and raised sufficiently high to protect the vessels\r\nwithin them from the waves and boat attacks. It is by such a wall that\r\nthe harbor of Cherbury has been made. The middle grounds have a firmer\r\nbottom, and lie two or three miles from the ship channel on either side,\r\nand so near the Cape as to be at hand for any enemy moored or becalmed\r\nwithin them. A survey of them was desired, and some officer of the navy\r\nreceived orders on the subject, who being opposed to our possessing\r\nanything below a frigate or line of battle ship, either visited or did\r\nnot visit them, and verbally expressed his opinion of impracticability.\r\nI state these things from memory, and may err in small circumstances,\r\nbut not in the general impression.\r\n\r\nA second station offering itself was the mouth of Lynhaven river, which\r\nhaving but four or five feet water, the vessels would be to be adapted\r\nto that, or its entrance deepened; but there it would be requisite to\r\nhave, first, a fort protecting the vessels within it, and strong enough\r\nto hold out until a competent force of militia could be collected for\r\nits relief. And, second, a canal uniting the tide waters of Lynhaven\r\nriver and the eastern branch, three or four miles apart only of low\r\nlevel country. This would afford to the vessels a retreat for their own\r\nsafety, and a communication with Norfolk and Albemarle Sound, so as to\r\ngive succor to these places if attacked, or receive it from them for a\r\nspecial enterprise. It was believed that such a canal would then have\r\ncost about thirty thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nThis being a case of personal as well as public interest, I thought\r\na private application not improper, and indeed preferable to a more\r\ngeneral one, with an executive needing no stimulus to do what is right;\r\nand therefore, in May and June, 1813, I took the liberty of writing to\r\nthem on this subject, the defence of Chesapeake; and to what is before\r\nstated I added some observations on the importance and pressure of the\r\ncase. A view of the map of the United States shows that the Chesapeake\r\nreceives either the whole or important waters of five of the most\r\nproducing of the Atlantic States, to wit: North Carolina, (for the Dismal\r\ncanal makes Albemarle Sound a water of the Chesapeake, and Norfolk its\r\nport of exportation,) Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania and New York. We\r\nknow that the waters of the Chesapeake, from the Genesee to the Sawra\r\ntowns and Albemarle Sound, comprehend two-fifths of the population of\r\nthe Atlantic States, and furnish probably more than half their exported\r\nproduce; that the loss of James river alone, in that year, was estimated\r\nat two hundred thousand barrels of flour, fed away to horses or sold at\r\nhalf-price, which was a levy of a million of dollars on a single one of\r\nthese numerous waters, and that levy to be repeated every year during\r\nthe war; that this important country can all be shut up by two or three\r\nships of the enemy, lying at the mouth of the bay; that an injury so vast\r\nto us and so cheap to the enemy, must forever be resorted to by them,\r\nand maintained constantly through every war; that this was a hard trial\r\nof the spirit of the Middle States, a trial which, backed by impossible\r\ntaxes, might produce a demand for peace on any terms; that when it was\r\nconsidered that the Union had already expended four millions of dollars\r\nfor the defence of the single city of Norfolk, and the waters of a\r\nsingle river, the Hudson, (which we entirely approved, and now we might\r\nprobably add four more since expended on the same spot,) we thought it\r\nvery moderate for so great a portion of the country, the population, the\r\nwealth, and contributing industry and strength of the Atlantic States,\r\nto ask a few hundred thousand dollars, to save the harassment of their\r\nmilitia, conflagrations of their towns and houses, devastations of their\r\nfarms, and annihilation of all the annual fruits of their labor. The idea\r\nof defending the bay at its mouth was approved, but the necessary works\r\nwere deemed inexecutable during a war, and an answer more cogent was\r\nfurnished by the fact that our treasury and credit were both exhausted.\r\nSince the war, I have learned (I cannot say how) that the Executive\r\nhas taken up the subject and sent on an engineer to examine and report\r\nthe localities, and that this engineer thought favorably of the middle\r\ngrounds. But my recollection is too indistinct but to suggest inquiry\r\nto you. After having once taken the liberty of soliciting the Executive\r\non this subject, I do not think it would be respectful for me to do\r\nit a second time, nor can it be necessary with persons who need only\r\nsuggestions of what is right, and not importunities to do it. If the\r\nsubject is brought before them, they can readily recall or recur to my\r\nletters, if worth it. But would it not be advisable in the first place,\r\nto have surveys made of the middle grounds and the grounds between the\r\ntidewaters of Lynhaven and the Eastern branch, that your representations\r\nmay be made on known facts? These would be parts only of the surveys you\r\nare authorized to make, and might, for so good a reason, be anticipated\r\nand executed before the general work can be done.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, however, the view is directed to a defence by frigates or ships\r\nof the line, stationed at York or elsewhere. Against this, in my opinion,\r\nboth reason and experience declaim. Had we half a dozen seventy-fours\r\nstationed at York, the enemy would place a dozen at the capes. This great\r\nforce called there would enable them to make large detachments against\r\nNorfolk when it suited them, to harass and devastate the bay coasts\r\nincessantly, and would oblige us to keep large armies of militia at York\r\nto defend the ships, and at Norfolk to defend that. The experience of\r\nNew London proves how certain and destructive this blockade would be;\r\nfor New London owed its blockade and the depredations on its coasts to\r\nthe presence of a frigate sent there for its defence; and did the frigate\r\nat Norfolk bring us defence or assault?\r\n\r\nII. _Education._--The President and Directors of the literary fund are\r\ndesired to digest and report a system of public education, comprehending\r\nthe establishment of an university, additional colleges or academies,\r\nand schools. The resolution does not define the portions of science to\r\nbe taught in each of these institutions, but the first and last admit no\r\ndoubt. The university must be intended for all useful sciences, and the\r\nschools mean elementary ones, for the instruction of the people, answering\r\nto our present English schools; the middle-term colleges or academies may\r\nbe more conjectural. But we must understand from it some middle-grade of\r\neducation. Now, when we advert that the ancient classical languages are\r\nconsidered as the foundation preparatory for all the sciences; that we\r\nhave always had schools scattered over the country for teaching these\r\nlanguages, which often were the ultimate term of education; that these\r\nlanguages are entered on at the age of nine or ten years, at which age\r\nparents would be unwilling to send their children from every part of\r\nthe State to a central and distant university, and when we observe that\r\nthe resolution supposes there are to be a plurality of them, we may well\r\nconclude that the Greek and Latin are the objects of these colleges. It\r\nis probable, also, that the legislature might have under their eye the\r\nbill for the more general diffusion of knowledge, printed in the revised\r\ncode of 1779, which proposed these three grades of institution, to-wit:\r\nan university, district colleges, or grammar schools, and county or ward\r\nschools. I think, therefore, we may say that the object of these colleges\r\nis the classical languages, and that they are intended as the portico\r\nof entry to the university. As to their numbers, I know no better rule\r\nto be assumed than to place one within a day's ride of every man's door,\r\nin consideration of the infancy of the pledges he has at it. This would\r\nrequire one for every eight miles square.\r\n\r\nSupposing this the object of the Colleges, the Report will have to\r\npresent the plan of an University, analyzing the sciences, selecting\r\nthose which are useful, grouping them into professorships, commensurate\r\neach with the time and faculties of one man, and prescribing the regimen\r\nand all other necessary details. On this subject I can offer nothing\r\nnew. A letter of mine to Peter Carr, which was published during the last\r\nSession of Assembly, is a digest of all the information I possess on\r\nthe subject, from which the Board will judge whether they can extract\r\nanything useful; the professorship of the classical languages being of\r\ncourse to be expunged, as more effectually supplied by the establishment\r\nof the colleges.\r\n\r\nAs the buildings to be erected will also enter into their Report, 1\r\nwould strongly recommend to their consideration, instead of one immense\r\nbuilding, to have a small one for every professorship, arranged at proper\r\ndistances around a square, to admit extension, connected by a piazza,\r\nso that they may go dry from one school to another. This village form is\r\npreferable to a single great building for many reasons, particularly on\r\naccount of fire, health, economy, peace and quiet. Such a plan had been\r\napproved in the case of the Albemarle college, which was the subject of\r\nthe letter above mentioned; and should the idea be approved by the Board,\r\nmore may be said hereafter on the opportunity these small buildings\r\nwill afford, of exhibiting models in architecture of the purest forms\r\nof antiquity, furnishing to the student examples of the precepts he will\r\nbe taught in that art.\r\n\r\nThe Elementary or Ward schools is the last branch of this subject; on\r\nthis, too, my ideas have been long deposited in the Bill for the diffusion\r\nof knowledge, before mentioned, and time and reflection have continued\r\nto strengthen them as to the general principle, that of a division of\r\nevery county into wards, with a school in each ward. The details of the\r\nbill will of course be varied as the difference of present circumstances\r\nfrom those of that day will require.\r\n\r\nMy partiality for that division is not founded in views of education\r\nsolely, but infinitely more as the means of a better administration\r\nof our government, and the eternal preservation of its republican\r\nprinciples. The example of this most admirable of all human contrivances\r\nin government, is to be seen in our Eastern States; and its powerful\r\neffect in the order and economy of their internal affairs, and the\r\nmomentum it gives them as a nation, is the single circumstance which\r\ndistinguishes them so remarkably from every other national association.\r\nIn a letter to Mr. Adams a few years ago, I had occasion to explain to\r\nhim the structure of our scheme of education as proposed in the bill for\r\nthe diffusion of knowledge, and the views of this particular section of\r\nit; and in another lately to Mr. Cabell, on the occasion of the bill for\r\nthe Albemarle College, I also took a view of the political effects of\r\nthe proposed division into wards, which being more easily copied than\r\nthrown into new form here, I take the liberty of enclosing extracts from\r\nthem. Should the Board of Directors approve of the plan, and make ward\r\ndivisions the substratum of their elementary schools, their report may\r\nfurnish a happy occasion of introducing them, leaving all their other\r\nuses to be adopted from time to time hereafter as occasions shall occur.\r\n\r\nWith these subjects I shall close the present letter, but that it may be\r\nnecessary to anticipate on the next one so far as respects proper persons\r\nfor carrying into execution the astronomical and geometrical surveys. I\r\nknow no one in the State equal to the first who could be engaged in it;\r\nbut my acquaintance in the State is very limited. There is a person near\r\nWashington possessing every quality which could be desired, among our\r\nfirst mathematicians and astronomers, of good bodily activity, used to\r\nrough living, of great experience in field operations, and of the most\r\nperfect integrity. I speak of Isaac Briggs, who was Surveyor-General\r\nsouth of Ohio, and who was employed to trace the route from Washington\r\nto New Orleans, below the mountains, which he did with great accuracy\r\nby observations of longitude and latitude only, on a journey thither. I\r\ndo not know that he would undertake the present work, but I have learnt\r\nthat he is at this time disengaged; I know he is poor, and was always\r\nmoderate in his views. This is the most important of all the surveys,\r\nand if done by him, I will answer for this part of your work standing\r\nthe test of time and criticism. If you should desire it, I could write\r\nand press him to undertake it; but it would be necessary to say something\r\nabout compensation.\r\n\r\nJohn Wood, of the Petersburg Academy, has written to me that he would be\r\nwilling to undertake the geometrical survey of the external boundaries,\r\nand internal divisions. We have certainly no abler mathematician; and he\r\ninforms me he has had good experience in the works of the field. He is\r\na great walker, and is, therefore, probably equal to the bodily fatigue,\r\nwhich is a material qualification. But he is so much better known where\r\nyou are, that I need only mention his readiness to undertake, and your\r\nown personal knowledge or inquiries will best determine what should be\r\ndone. It is the part of the work above the tide waters which he would\r\nundertake; that below, where soundings are to be taken, requiring nautical\r\napparatus and practice.\r\n\r\nWhether he is a mineralogist or not, I do not know. It would be a\r\nconvenient and economical association with that of the geometrical survey.\r\n\r\nI am obliged to postpone for some days the consideration of the remaining\r\nsubjects of your letter. Accept the assurance of my great esteem and\r\nhigh consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. JOSEPH MILLIGAN.\r\n\r\n                                                 MONTICELLO, April 6, 1816.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your favor of March 6th did not come to hand until the 15th. I\r\nthen expected I should finish revising the translation of Tracy's book\r\nwithin a week, and could send the whole together. I got through it, but,\r\non further consideration, thought I ought to read it over again, lest\r\nany errors should have been left in it. It was fortunate I did so, for\r\nI found several little errors. The whole is now done and forwarded by\r\nthis mail, with a title, and something I have written which may serve for\r\na Prospectus, and indeed for a Preface also, with a little alteration.\r\nYou will see from the face of the work what a horrible job I have had\r\nin the revisal. It is so defaced that it is absolutely necessary you\r\nshould have a fair copy taken, and by a person of good understanding, for\r\nthat will be necessary to decipher the erasures, interlineations, &c.,\r\nof the translation. The translator's orthography, too, will need great\r\ncorrection, as you will find a multitude of words shamefully misspelt;\r\nand he seems to have had no idea of the use of stops: he uses the comma\r\nvery commonly for a full stop; and as often the full stop, followed by a\r\ncapital letter, for a comma. Your copyist will, therefore, have to stop\r\nit properly quite through the work. Still, there will be places where\r\nit cannot be stopped correctly without reference to the original; for\r\nI observed many instances where a member of a sentence might be given\r\neither to the preceding or following one, grammatically, which would\r\nyet make the sense very different, and could, therefore, be rectified\r\nonly by the original. I have, therefore, thought it would be better for\r\nyou to send me the proof sheets as they come out of the press. We have\r\ntwo mails a week, which leave this Wednesdays and Saturdays, and you\r\nshould always receive it by return of the first mail. Only observe that\r\nI set out for Bedford in five or six days, and shall not be back till\r\nthe first week in May.\r\n\r\nThe original construction of the style of the translation was so bungling,\r\nthat although I have made it render the author's sense faithfully, yet\r\nit was impossible to change the structure of the sentences to anything\r\ngood. I have endeavored to apologize for it in the Prospectus; as also\r\nto prepare the reader for the dry, and to most of them, uninteresting\r\ncharacter of the preliminary tracts, advising him to pass at once to the\r\nbeginning of the main work, where, also, you will see I have recommended\r\nthe beginning the principal series of pages. In this I have departed\r\nfrom the order of pages adopted by the author.\r\n\r\nMy name must in nowise appear connected with the work. I have no objection\r\nto your naming me _in conversation_, but not in print, as the person\r\nto whom the original was communicated. Although the author puts his\r\nname to the work, yet, if called to account for it by his government,\r\nhe means to disavow it, which its publication at such a distance will\r\nenable him to do. But he would not think himself at liberty to do this\r\nif avowedly sanctioned by me here. The best open mark of approbation I\r\ncan give is to subscribe for a dozen copies; or if you would prefer it,\r\nyou may place on your subscription paper a letter in these words: \"Sir,\r\nI subscribe with pleasure for a dozen copies of the invaluable book you\r\nare about to publish on Political Economy. I should be happy to see it\r\nin the hands of every American citizen.\"\r\n\r\nThe Ainsworth, Ovid, Cornelius Nepos and Virgil, as also of the two\r\nbooks below mentioned,[15] and formerly written for. I fear I shall not\r\nget the Ovid and Nepos I sent to be bound, in time for the pocket in my\r\nBedford trip. Accept my best wishes and respects.\r\n\r\nTITLE.--\"A Treatise on Political Economy by the Count Dustutt Tracy,\r\nmember of the Senate and Institute of France, and of the American\r\nPhilosophical Society, to which is prefixed a supplement to a preceding\r\nwork on the Understanding or Elements of Ideology, by the same author,\r\nwith an analytical table and an introduction on the faculty of the will,\r\ntranslated from the unpublished French original.\"\r\n\r\n_Prospectus._--Political economy in modern times assumed the form of\r\na regular science first in the hands of the political sect in France,\r\ncalled the Economists. They made it a branch only of a comprehensive\r\nsystem on the natural order of societies. Quesnai first, Gournay, Le\r\nFrosne, Turgot and Dupont de Nemours, the enlightened, philanthropic,\r\nand venerable citizen, now of the United States, led the way in these\r\ndevelopments, and gave to our inquiries the direction they have since\r\nobserved. Many sound and valuable principles established by them, have\r\nreceived the sanction of general approbation. Some, as in the infancy of\r\na science might be expected, have been brought into question, and have\r\nfurnished occasion for much discussion. Their opinions on production, and\r\non the proper subjects of taxation, have been particularly controverted;\r\nand whatever may be the merit of their principles of taxation, it is\r\nnot wonderful they have not prevailed; not on the questioned score of\r\ncorrectness, but because not acceptable to the people, whose will must\r\nbe the supreme law. Taxation is in fact the most difficult function of\r\ngovernment--and that against which their citizens are most apt to be\r\nrefractory. The general aim is therefore to adopt the mode most consonant\r\nwith the circumstances and sentiments of the country.\r\n\r\nAdam Smith, first in England, published a rational and systematic work\r\non Political Economy, adopting generally the ground of the Economists,\r\nbut differing on the subjects before specified. The system being novel,\r\nmuch argument and detail seemed then necessary to establish principles\r\nwhich now are assented to as soon as proposed. Hence his book, admitted\r\nto be able, and of the first degree of merit, has yet been considered\r\nas prolix and tedious.\r\n\r\nIn France, John Baptist Say has the merit of producing a very superior\r\nwork on the subject of political economy. His arrangement is luminous,\r\nideas clear, style perspicuous, and the whole subject brought within\r\nhalf the volume of Smith's work. Add to this considerable advances in\r\ncorrectness and extension of principles.\r\n\r\nThe work of Senator Tracy, now announced, comes forward with all the\r\nlights of his predecessors in the science, and with the advantages of\r\nfurther experience, more discussion, and greater maturity of subjects.\r\nIt is certainly distinguished by important traits; a cogency of logic\r\nwhich has never been exceeded in any work, a rigorous enchainment of\r\nideas, and constant recurrence to it to keep it in the reader's view,\r\na fearless pursuit of truth whithersoever it leads, and a diction so\r\ncorrect that not a word can be changed but for the worse; and, as happens\r\nin other cases, that the more a subject is understood, the more briefly\r\nit may be explained, he has reduced, not indeed all the details, but\r\nall the elements and the system of principles within the compass of an\r\n8vo, of about 400 pages. Indeed we might say within two-thirds of that\r\nspace, the one-third being taken up with some preliminary pieces now to\r\nbe noticed.\r\n\r\nMr. Tracy is the author of a treatise on the Elements of Ideology, justly\r\nconsidered as a production of the first order in the science of our\r\nthinking faculty, or of the understanding. Considering the present work\r\nbut as a second section to those Elements under the titles of Analytical\r\nTable, Supplement, and Introduction, he gives in these preliminary\r\npieces a supplement to the Elements, shows how the present work stands\r\non that as its basis, presents a summary view of it, and, before\r\nentering on the formation, distribution, and employment of property and\r\npersonality, a question not new indeed, yet one which has not hitherto\r\nbeen satisfactorily settled. These investigations are very metaphysical,\r\nprofound, and demonstrative, and will give satisfaction to minds in the\r\nhabit of abstract speculation. Readers, however, not disposed to enter\r\ninto them, after reading the summary view, entitled, \"on our actions,\"\r\nwill probably pass on at once to the commencement of the main subject\r\nof the work, which is treated of under the following heads:\r\n\r\n     Of Society.\r\n     Of Production, or the formation of our riches.\r\n     Of Value, or the measure of utility.\r\n     Of change of form, or fabrication.\r\n     Of change of place, or commerce.\r\n     Of money.\r\n     Of the distribution of our riches.\r\n     Of population.\r\n     Of the employment of our riches, or consumption.\r\n     Of public revenue, expenses and debts.\r\n\r\nAlthough the work now offered is but a translation, it may be considered\r\nin some degree as the original, that having never been published\r\nin the country in which it was written. The author would there have\r\nbeen submitted to the unpleasant alternative either of mutilating his\r\nsentiments, where they were either free or doubtful, or of risking himself\r\nunder the unsettled regimen of the press. A manuscript copy communicated\r\nto a friend here has enabled him to give it to a country which is afraid\r\nto read nothing, and which may be trusted with anything, so long as its\r\nreason remains unfettered by law.\r\n\r\nIn the translation, fidelity has been chiefly consulted. A more correct\r\nstyle would sometimes have given a shade of sentiment which was not the\r\nauthor's, and which, in a work standing in the place of the original,\r\nwould have been unjust towards him. Some gallicisms have, therefore, been\r\nadmitted, where a single word gives an idea which would require a whole\r\nphrase of dictionary-English. Indeed, the horrors of Neologism, which\r\nstartle the purist, have given no alarm to the translator. Where brevity,\r\nperspicuity, and even euphony can be promoted by the introduction of a\r\nnew word, it is an improvement to the language. It is thus the English\r\nlanguage has been brought to what it is; one half of it having been\r\ninnovations, made at different times, from the Greek, Latin, French, and\r\nother languages. And is it the worse for these? Had the preposterous idea\r\nof fixing the language been adopted by our Saxon ancestors, of Pierce\r\nPlowman, of Chaucer, of Spenser, the progress of ideas must have stopped\r\nwith that of the language. On the contrary, nothing is more evident than\r\nthat as we advance in the knowledge of new things, and of new combinations\r\nof old ones, we must have new words to express them. Were Van Helmont,\r\nStane, Scheele, to rise from the dead at this time, they would scarcely\r\nunderstand one word of their own science. Would it have been better,\r\nthen, to have abandoned the science of Chemistry, rather than admit\r\ninnovations in its terms? What a wonderful accession of copiousness and\r\nforce has the French language attained, by the innovations of the last\r\nthirty years! And what do we not owe to Shakspeare for the enrichment\r\nof the language, by his free and magical creation of words? In giving\r\na loose to neologism, indeed, uncouth words will sometimes be offered;\r\nbut the public will judge them, and receive or reject, as sense or sound\r\nshall suggest, and authors will be approved or condemned according to\r\nthe use they make of this license, as they now are from their use of\r\nthe present vocabulary. The claim of the present translation, however,\r\nis limited to its duties of fidelity and justice to the sense of its\r\noriginal; adopting the author's own word only where no term of our own\r\nlanguage would convey his meaning.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_A Note communicated to the Editor._)\r\n\r\nOur author's classification of taxes being taken from those practised in\r\nFrance, will scarcely be intelligible to an American reader, to whom the\r\nnature as well as names of some of them must be unknown. The taxes with\r\nwhich we are familiar, class themselves readily according to the basis\r\non which they rest. 1. Capital. 2. Income. 3. Consumption. These may be\r\nconsidered as commensurate; Consumption being generally equal to Income,\r\nand Income the annual profit of Capital. A government may select either\r\nof these bases for the establishment of its system of taxation, and so\r\nframe it as to reach the faculties of every member of the society, and\r\nto draw from him his equal proportion of the public contributions; and,\r\nif this be correctly obtained, it is the perfection of the function of\r\ntaxation. But when once a government has assumed its basis, to select\r\nand tax special articles from either of the other classes, is double\r\ntaxation. For example, if the system be established on the basis of\r\nIncome, and his just proportion on that scale has been already drawn\r\nfrom every one, to step into the field of Consumption, and tax special\r\narticles in that, as broadcloth or homespun, wine or whiskey, a coach or\r\na wagon, is doubly taxing the same article. For that portion of Income\r\nwith which these articles are purchased, having already paid its tax as\r\nIncome, to pay another tax on the thing it purchased, is paying twice\r\nfor the same thing, it is an aggrievance on the citizens who use these\r\narticles in exoneration of those who do not, contrary to the most sacred\r\nof the duties of a government, to do equal and impartial justice to all\r\nits citizens.\r\n\r\nHow far it may be the interest and the duty of all to submit to this\r\nsacrifice on other grounds, for instance, to pay for a time an impost\r\non the importation of certain articles, in order to encourage their\r\nmanufacture at home, or an excise on others injurious to the morals or\r\nhealth of the citizens, will depend on a series of considerations of\r\nanother order, and beyond the proper limits of this note. The reader,\r\nin deciding which basis of taxation is most eligible for the local\r\ncircumstances of his country, will, of course, avail himself of the\r\nweighty observations of our author.\r\n\r\nTo this a single observation shall yet be added. Whether property\r\nalone, and the whole of what each citizen possesses, shall be subject\r\nto contribution, or only its surplus after satisfying his first wants,\r\nor whether the faculties of body and mind shall contribute also from\r\ntheir annual earnings, is a question to be decided. But, when decided,\r\nand the principle settled, it is to be equally and fairly applied to\r\nall. To take from one, because it is thought that his own industry and\r\nthat of his fathers has acquired too much, in order to spare to others,\r\nwho, or whose fathers have not exercised equal industry and skill, is to\r\nviolate arbitrarily the first principle of association, \"the _guarantee_\r\nto every one of a free exercise of his industry, and the fruits acquired\r\nby it.\" If the overgrown wealth of an individual be deemed dangerous to\r\nthe State, the best corrective is the law of equal inheritance to all\r\nin equal degree; and the better, as this enforces a law of nature, while\r\nextra-taxation violates it.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n    [15] Moore's Greek Grammar, translated by Ewen. Mair's Tyro's\r\n    Dictionary.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\n                                                 MONTICELLO, April 8, 1816.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have to acknowledge your two favors of February the 16th\r\nand March the 2d, and to join sincerely in the sentiment of Mrs. Adams,\r\nand regret that distance separates us so widely. An hour of conversation\r\nwould be worth a volume of letters. But we must take things as they come.\r\n\r\nYou ask, if I would agree to live my seventy or rather seventy-three\r\nyears over again? To which I say, yea. I think with you, that it is\r\na good world on the whole; that it has been framed on a principle of\r\nbenevolence, and more pleasure than pain dealt out to us. There are,\r\nindeed, (who might say nay) gloomy and hypochondriac minds, inhabitants\r\nof diseased bodies, disgusted with the present, and despairing of the\r\nfuture; always counting that the worst will happen, because it may happen.\r\nTo these I say, how much pain have cost us the evils which have never\r\nhappened! My temperament is sanguine. I steer my bark with Hope in the\r\nhead, leaving Fear astern. My hopes, indeed, sometimes fail; but not\r\noftener than the forebodings of the gloomy. There are, I acknowledge, even\r\nin the happiest life, some terrible convulsions, heavy set-offs against\r\nthe opposite page of the account. I have often wondered for what good\r\nend the sensations of grief could be intended. All our other passions,\r\nwithin proper bounds, have an useful object. And the perfection of the\r\nmoral character is, not in a stoical apathy, so hypocritically vaunted,\r\nand so untruly too, because impossible, but in a just equilibrium of all\r\nthe passions. I wish the pathologists then would tell us what is the use\r\nof grief in the economy, and of what good it is the cause, proximate or\r\nremote.\r\n\r\nDid I know Baron Grimm while at Paris? Yes, most intimately. He was the\r\npleasantest and most conversable member of the diplomatic corps while\r\nI was there; a man of good fancy, acuteness, irony, cunning and egoism.\r\nNo heart, not much of any science, yet enough of every one to speak its\r\nlanguage; his forte was Belles-lettres, painting and sculpture. In these\r\nhe was the oracle of society, and as such, was the Empress Catharine's\r\nprivate correspondent and factor, in all things not diplomatic. It was\r\nthrough him I got her permission for poor Ledyard to go to Kamschatka, and\r\ncross over thence to the western coast of America, in order to penetrate\r\nacross our continent in the opposite direction to that afterwards\r\nadopted for Lewis and Clarke; which permission she withdrew after he\r\nhad got within two hundred miles of Kamschatka, had him seized, brought\r\nback, and set down in Poland. Although I never heard Grimm express\r\nthe opinion directly, yet I always supposed him to be of the school of\r\nDiderot, D'Alembert, D'Holbach; the first of whom committed his system of\r\natheism to writing in \"_Le bon sens_,\" and the last in his \"_Systeme de\r\nla Nature_.\" It was a numerous school in the Catholic countries, while\r\nthe infidelity of the Protestant took generally the form of theism. The\r\nformer always insisted that it was a mere question of definition between\r\nthem, the hypostasis of which, on both sides, was \"_Nature_,\" or \"_the\r\nUniverse_;\" that both agreed in the order of the existing system, but\r\nthe one supposed it from eternity, the other as having begun in time.\r\nAnd when the atheist descanted on the unceasing motion and circulation\r\nof matter through the animal, vegetable and mineral kingdoms, never\r\nresting, never annihilated, always changing form, and under all forms\r\ngifted with the power of reproduction; the theist pointing \"to the heavens\r\nabove, and to the earth beneath, and to the waters under the earth,\"\r\nasked, if these did not proclaim a first cause, possessing intelligence\r\nand power; power in the production, and intelligence in the design and\r\nconstant preservation of the system; urged the palpable existence of\r\nfinal causes; that the eye was made to see, and the ear to hear, and\r\nnot that we see because we have eyes, and hear because we have ears; an\r\nanswer obvious to the senses, as that of walking across the room, was\r\nto the philosopher demonstrating the non-existence of motion. It was in\r\nD'Holbach's conventicles that Rousseau imagined all the machinations\r\nagainst him were contrived; and he left, in his Confessions, the most\r\nbiting anecdotes of Grimm. These appeared after I left France; but I\r\nhave heard that poor Grimm was so much afflicted by them, that he kept\r\nhis bed several weeks. I have never seen the Memoirs of Grimm. Their\r\nvolume has kept them out of our market.\r\n\r\nI have lately been amusing myself with Levi's book, in answer to Dr.\r\nPriestley. It is a curious and tough work. His style is inelegant and\r\nincorrect, harsh and petulant to his adversary, and his reasoning flimsy\r\nenough. Some of his doctrines were new to me, particularly that of his\r\ntwo resurrections; the first, a particular one of all the dead, in body as\r\nwell as soul, who are to live over again, the Jews in a state of perfect\r\nobedience to God, the other nations in a state of corporeal punishment\r\nfor the sufferings they have inflicted on the Jews. And he explains\r\nthis resurrection of the bodies to be only of the original stamen of\r\nLeibnitz, or the human _calus_ in _semine masculino_, considering that\r\nas a mathematical point, insusceptible of separation or division. The\r\nsecond resurrection, a general one of souls and bodies, eternally to\r\nenjoy divine glory in the presence of the Supreme Being. He alleges that\r\nthe Jews alone preserve the doctrine of the unity of God. Yet their God\r\nwould be deemed a very indifferent man with us; and it was to correct\r\ntheir anamorphosis of the Deity, that Jesus preached, as well as to\r\nestablish the doctrine of a future state. However, Levi insists, that\r\nthat was taught in the Old Testament, and even by Moses himself and the\r\nprophets. He agrees that an annointed prince was prophesied and promised;\r\nbut denies that the character and history of Jesus had any analogy with\r\nthat of the person promised. He must be fearfully embarrassing to the\r\nHierophants of fabricated Christianity; because it is their own armor in\r\nwhich he clothes himself for the attack. For example, he takes passages\r\nof scripture from their context, (which would give them a very different\r\nmeaning,) strings them together, and makes them point towards what object\r\nhe pleases; he interprets them figuratively, typically, analogically,\r\nhyperbolically; he calls in the aid of emendation, transposition, ellipse,\r\nmetonymy, and every other figure of rhetoric; the name of one man is\r\ntaken for another, one place for another, days and weeks for months\r\nand years; and finally, he avails himself all his advantage over his\r\nadversaries by his superior knowledge of the Hebrew, speaking in the\r\nvery language of the divine communication, while they can only fumble on\r\nwith conflicting and disputed translations. Such is this war of giants.\r\nAnd how can such pigmies as you and I decide between them? For myself,\r\nI confess that my head is not formed _tantas componere lites_. And as\r\nyou began yours of March the 2d, with a declaration that you were about\r\nto write me the most frivolous letter I had ever read, so I will close\r\nmine by saying, I have written you a full match for it, and by adding\r\nmy affectionate respects to Mrs. Adams, and the assurance of my constant\r\nattachment and consideration for yourself.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR NICHOLAS.\r\n\r\n                                             POPLAR FOREST, April 19, 1816.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--In my letter of the 2d instant, I stated, according to your\r\nrequest, what occurred to me on the subjects of Defence and Education;\r\nand I will now proceed to do the same on the remaining subject of yours\r\nof March 22d, the construction of a general map of the State. For this\r\nthe legislature directs there shall be,\r\n\r\nI. A topographical survey of each county.\r\n\r\nII. A general survey of the outlines of the State, and its leading\r\nfeatures of rivers and mountains.\r\n\r\nIII. An astronomical survey for the correction and collection of the\r\nothers, and\r\n\r\nIV. A mineralogical survey.\r\n\r\nI. Although the topographical survey of each county is referred to its\r\ncourt in the first instance, yet such a control is given to the Executive\r\nas places it effectively under his direction; that this control must\r\nbe freely and generally exercised, I have no doubt. Nobody expects\r\nthat the justices of the peace in every county are so familiar with the\r\nastronomical and geometrical principles to be employed in the execution\r\nof this work, as to be competent to decide what candidate possesses\r\nthem in the highest degree, or in any degree; and indeed I think it\r\nwould be reasonable, considering how much the other affairs of the\r\nState must engross of the time of the Governor and Council, for them to\r\nmake it a pre-requisite for every candidate to undergo an examination\r\nby the mathematical professor of William and Mary College, or some\r\nother professional character, and to ask for a special and confidential\r\nreport of the grade of qualification of each candidate examined. If one,\r\ncompletely qualified, can be found for every half dozen counties, it\r\nwill be as much, perhaps, as can be expected.\r\n\r\nTheir office will be to survey the Rivers, Roads, and Mountains.\r\n\r\n1. A proper division of the surveys of the Rivers between them and\r\nthe general surveyor, might be to ascribe to the latter so much as is\r\nnavigable, and to the former the parts not navigable, but yet sufficient\r\nfor working machinery, which the law requires. On these they should\r\nnote confluences, other natural and remarkable objects, towns, mills or\r\nother machines, ferries, bridges, crossings of roads, passages through\r\nmountains, mines, quarries, &c.\r\n\r\n2. In surveying the Roads, the same objects should be noted, and every\r\npermanent stream crossing them, and these streams should be laid down\r\naccording to the best information they can obtain, to their confluence\r\nwith the main stream.\r\n\r\n3. The Mountains, others than those ascribed to the general surveyor,\r\nshould be laid down by their names and bases, which last will be generally\r\ndesignated by the circumscription of water courses and roads on both\r\nsides, without a special survey around them. Their gaps are also required\r\nto be noted.\r\n\r\n4. On the Boundaries, the same objects should be noted. Where a boundary\r\nfalls within the operations of the general surveyor, its survey by them\r\nshould be dispensed with, and where it is common to two counties, it might\r\nbe ascribed wholly to one, or divided between the surveyors respectively.\r\nAll these surveys should be delineated on the same scale, which the law\r\ndirects, I believe, (for I have omitted to bring the copy of it with\r\nme to this place,) if it has not fixed the scale. I think about half an\r\ninch to the mile would be a convenient one, because it would generally\r\nbring the map of a county within the compass of a sheet of paper. And\r\nhere I would suggest what would be a great desideratum for the public,\r\nto wit, that a single sheet map of each county separately, on a scale\r\nof half an inch to the mile, be engraved and struck off. There are few\r\nhousekeepers who would not wish to possess a map of their own county,\r\nmany would purchase those of their circumjacent counties, and many\r\nwould take one of every county, and form them into an atlas, so that\r\nI question if as many copies of each particular map would not be sold\r\nas of the general one. But these should not be made until they receive\r\nthe astronomical corrections, without which they can never be brought\r\ntogether and joined into larger maps, at the will of the purchaser.\r\n\r\nTheir instrument should be a Circumferentor, with cross spirit levels\r\non its face, a graduated rim, and a double index, the one fixed, the\r\nother movable, with a nonius on it. The needle should never be depended\r\non for an angle.\r\n\r\nII. The General Survey divides itself into two distinct operations; the\r\none on the tide waters, the other above them.\r\n\r\nOn the tide waters the State will have little to do. Some time before\r\nthe war, Congress authorized the Executive to have an accurate survey\r\nmade of the whole sea-coast of the United States, comprehending, as\r\nwell as I remember, the principal bays and harbors. A Mr. Hassler,\r\na mathematician of the first order from Geneva, was engaged in the\r\nexecution, and was sent to England to procure proper instruments. He has\r\nlately returned with such a set as never before crossed the Atlantic,\r\nand is scarcely possessed by any nation on the continent of Europe.\r\nWe shall be furnished, then, by the General Government, with a better\r\nsurvey than we can make, of our sea-coast, Chesapeake Bay, probably the\r\nPotomac, to the Navy Yard at Washington, and possibly of James' River\r\nto Norfolk, and York River to Yorktown. I am not, however, able to say\r\nthat these, or what other, are the precise limits of their intentions.\r\nThe Secretary of the Treasury would probably inform us. Above these\r\nlimits, whatever they are, the surveys and soundings will belong to the\r\npresent undertaking of the State; and if Mr. Hassler has time, before\r\nhe commences his general work, to execute this for us, with the use of\r\nthe instruments of the United States, it is impossible we can put it\r\ninto any train of execution equally good; and any compensation he may\r\nrequire, will be less than it would cost to purchase instruments of our\r\nown, and have the work imperfectly done by a less able hand. If we are\r\nto do it ourselves, I acknowledge myself too little familiar with the\r\nmethods of surveying a coast and taking soundings, to offer anything\r\non the subject approved by practice. I will pass on, therefore, to the\r\ngeneral survey of the Rivers above the tide waters, the Mountains, and\r\nthe external Boundaries.\r\n\r\nI. _Rivers._--I have already proposed that the general survey shall\r\ncomprehend these from the tide waters as far as they are navigable only,\r\nand here we shall find one-half of the work already done, and as ably\r\nas we may expect to do it. In the great controversy between the Lords\r\nBaltimore and Fairfax, between whose territories the Potomac, from its\r\nmouth to its source, was the chartered boundary, the question was which\r\nbranch, from Harper's ferry upwards, was to be considered as the Potomac?\r\nTwo able mathematicians, therefore, were brought over from England at the\r\nexpense of the parties, and under the sanction of the sentence pronounced\r\nbetween them, to survey the two branches, and ascertain which was to\r\nbe considered as the main stream. Lord Fairfax took advantage of their\r\nbeing here to get a correct survey by them of his whole territory, which\r\nwas bounded by the Potomac, the Rappahanoc, as was believed, in the most\r\naccurate manner. Their survey was doubtless filed and recorded in Lord\r\nFairfax's office, and I presume it still exists among his land papers.\r\nHe furnished a copy of that survey to Colonel Fry and my father, who\r\nentered it, on a reduced scale, into their map, as far as latitudes and\r\nadmeasurements accurately horizontal could produce exactness. I expect\r\nthis survey is to be relied on. But it is lawful to doubt whether its\r\nlongitudes may not need verification; because at that day the corrections\r\nhad not been made in the lunar tables, which have since introduced the\r\nmethod of ascertaining the longitude by the lunar distances; and that\r\nby Jupiter's satellites was impracticable in ambulatory survey. The most\r\nwe can count on is, that they may have employed some sufficient means to\r\nascertain the longitude of the first source of the Potomac, the meridian\r\nof which was to be Lord Baltimore's boundary. The longitudes, therefore,\r\nshould be verified and corrected, if necessary, and this will belong to\r\nthe Astronomical survey.\r\n\r\nThe other rivers only, then, from their tide waters up as far as\r\nnavigable, remain for this operator, and on them the same objects should\r\nbe noted as proposed in the county surveys; and, in addition, their\r\nbreadth at remarkable parts, such as the confluence of other streams,\r\nfalls, and ferries, the soundings of their main channels, bars, rapids,\r\nand principal sluices through their falls, their current at various\r\nplaces, and, if it can be done without more cost than advantage, their\r\nfall between certain stations.\r\n\r\nII. _Mountains._--I suppose the law contemplates, in the general survey,\r\nonly the principal continued ridges, and such insulated mountains as\r\nbeing correctly ascertained in their position, and visible from many\r\nand distant places, may, by their bearings, be useful correctives\r\nfor all the surveys, and especially for those of the counties. Of the\r\ncontinued ridges, the Alleghany, North Mountain, and Blue Ridge, are\r\nprincipal; ridges of partial lengths may be left to designation in the\r\ncounty surveys. Of insulated mountains, there are the Peaks of Otter, in\r\nBedford, which I believe may be seen from about twenty counties; Willis'\r\nMountains, in Buckingham, which from their detached situation, and so\r\nfar below all other mountains, may be seen over a great space of country;\r\nPeters' Mountain, in Albemarle, which, from its eminence above all others\r\nof the south-west ridge, may be seen to a great distance, probably to\r\nWillis' Mountain, and with that and the Peaks of Otter, furnishes a very\r\nextensive triangle; and doubtless there are many unknown to me, which,\r\nbeing truly located, offer valuable indications and correctives for the\r\ncounty surveys. For example, the sharp peak of Otter being precisely\r\nfixed in position by its longitude and latitude, a simple observation\r\nof latitude taken at any place from which that peak is visible, and an\r\nobservation of the angle it makes with the meridian of the place, furnish\r\na right-angled spherical triangle, of which the portion of meridian\r\nintercepted between the latitudes of the place and peak, will be on\r\none side. With this and the given angles, the other side, constituting\r\nthe difference of longitude, may be calculated, and thus by a correct\r\nposition of these commanding points, that of every place from which any\r\none of them is visible, may, by observations of latitude and bearing,\r\nbe ascertained in longitude also. If two such objects be visible from\r\nthe same place, it will afford, by another triangle, a double correction.\r\n\r\nThe gaps in the continued ridges, ascribed to the general surveyor,\r\nare required by the law to be noted; and so also are their heights.\r\nThis must certainly be understood with some limitation, as the height\r\nof every knob in these ridges could never be desired. Probably the law\r\ncontemplated only the eminent mountains in each ridge, such as would be\r\nconspicuous objects of observation to the country at great distances,\r\nand would offer the same advantages as the insulated mountains. Such\r\neminences in the Blue Ridge will be more extensively useful than those\r\nof the more western ridges. The height of gaps also, over which roads\r\npass, were probably in view.\r\n\r\nBut how are these heights to be taken, and from what base? I suppose\r\nfrom the plain on which they stand. But it is difficult to ascertain\r\nthe precise horizontal line of that plain, or to say where the ascent\r\nabove the general face of the country begins. Where there is a river or\r\nother considerable stream, or extensive meadow plains near the foot of\r\na mountain, which is much the case in the valleys dividing the western\r\nridges, I suppose that may be fairly considered in the level of its base,\r\nin the intendment of the law. Where there is no such term of commencement,\r\nthe surveyor must judge, as well as he can from his view, what point is\r\nin the general level of the adjacent country. How are these heights to\r\nbe taken, and with what instrument? Where a good base can be found, the\r\ngeometrical admeasurement is the most satisfactory. For this, a theodolite\r\nmust be provided of the most perfect construction, by Ramsden, Troughton\r\nif possible; and for horizontal angles it will be the better of two\r\ntelescopes. But such bases are rarely to be found. When none such, the\r\nheight may still be measured geometrically, by ascending or descending the\r\nmountain with the theodolite, measuring its face from station to station,\r\nnoting its inclination between these stations, and the hypothenusal\r\ndifference of that inclination, as indicated on the vertical arc of\r\nthe theodolite. The sum of the perpendiculars corresponding with the\r\nhypothenusal measures, is the height of the mountain. But a barometrical\r\nadmeasurement is preferable to this; since the late improvements in the\r\ntheory, they are to be depended on nearly as much as the geometrical,\r\nand are much more convenient and expeditious. The barometer should have\r\na sliding nonius, and a thermometer annexed, with a screw at the bottom\r\nto force up the column of mercury solidly. Without this precaution they\r\ncannot be transported at all; and even with it they are in danger from\r\nevery severe jolt. They go more safely on a baggage-horse than in a\r\ncarriage. The heights should be measured on both sides, to show the rise\r\nof the country at every ridge.\r\n\r\nObservations of longitude and latitude should be taken by the surveyor\r\nat all confluences of considerable streams, and on all mountains of\r\nwhich he measures the heights, whether insulated or in ridges; for this\r\npurpose, he should be furnished with a good Hadley's circle of Borda's\r\nconstruction, with three limbs of nonius indexes; if not to be had, a\r\nsextant of brass, and of the best construction, may do, and a chronometer;\r\nto these is to be added a Gunter's chain, with some appendix for plumbing\r\nthe chain.\r\n\r\nIII. The External Boundaries of the State, to-wit: Northern, Eastern,\r\nSouthern and Western. The Northern boundary consists of, 1st, the\r\nPotomac; 2d, a meridian from its source to Mason & Dixon's line; 3d, a\r\ncontinuation of that line to the meridian of the north-western corner\r\nof Pennsylvania, and 4th, of that meridian to its intersection with the\r\nOhio. 1st. The Potomac is supposed, as before mentioned, to be surveyed\r\nto our hand. 2d, The meridian, from its source to Mason & Dixon's line,\r\nwas, I believe, surveyed by them when they run the dividing line between\r\nLord Baltimore and Penn. I presume it can be had from either Annapolis\r\nor Philadelphia, and I think there is a copy of it, which I got from\r\nDr. Smith, in an atlas of the library of Congress. Nothing better can\r\nbe done by us. 3d. The continuation of Mason & Dixon's line and the\r\nmeridian from its termination to the Ohio, was done by Mr. Rittenhouse\r\nand others, and copies of their work are doubtless in our offices as\r\nwell as in those of Pennsylvania. What has been done by Rittenhouse can\r\nbe better done by no one.\r\n\r\nThe Eastern boundary being the sea-coast, we have before presumed will\r\nbe surveyed by the general government.\r\n\r\nThe Southern boundary. This has been extended and marked in different\r\nparts in the chartered latitude of 36° 31´ by three different sets of\r\nCommissioners. The eastern part by Dr. Byrd and other commissioners\r\nfrom Virginia and North Carolina: the middle by Fry and Jefferson from\r\nVirginia, and Churton and others from North Carolina; and the western\r\nby Dr. Walker and Daniel Smith, now of Tennessee. Whether Byrd's survey\r\nnow exists, I do not know. His journal is still in possession of some\r\none of the Westover family, and it would be well to seek for it, in\r\norder to judge of that portion of the line. Fry and Jefferson's journal\r\nwas burnt in the Shadwell house about fifty years ago, with all the\r\nmaterials of their map. Walker and Smith's survey is probably in our\r\noffices; there is a copy of it in the atlas before mentioned; but that\r\nsurvey was made on the spur of a particular occasion, and with a view to\r\na particular object only. During the revolutionary war, we were informed\r\nthat a treaty of peace was on the carpet in Europe, on the principle\r\nof _uti possidetis_; and we despatched those gentlemen immediately to\r\nascertain the intersection of our Southern boundary with the Mississippi,\r\nand ordered Colonel Clarke to erect a hasty fort on the first bluff\r\nabove the line, which was done as an act of possession. The intermediate\r\nline, between that and the termination of Fry and Jefferson's line, was\r\nprovisionary only, and not made with any particular care. That, then,\r\nrequires to be re-surveyed as far as the Cumberland mountain. But the\r\neastern and middle surveys will only need, I suppose, to have their\r\nlongitudes rectified by the astronomical surveyor.\r\n\r\nThe Western boundary, consisting of the Ohio, Big Sandy and Cumberland\r\nmountain, having been established while I was out of the country, I\r\nhave never had occasion to inquire whether they were actually surveyed,\r\nand with what degree of accuracy. But this fact being well known to\r\nyourself particularly, and to others who have been constantly present\r\nin the State, you will be more competent to decide what is to be done\r\nin that quarter. I presume, indeed, that this boundary will constitute\r\nthe principal and most difficult part of the operations of the General\r\nSurveyor.\r\n\r\nThe injunctions of the act to note the magnetic variations merit diligent\r\nattention. The law of those variations is not yet sufficiently known\r\nto satisfy us that sensible changes do not sometimes take place at\r\nsmall intervals of time and place. To render these observations of the\r\nvariations easy, and to encourage their frequency, a copy of a table of\r\namplitudes should be furnished to every surveyor, by which, wherever\r\nhe has a good Eastern horizon, he may, in a few seconds, at sunrise,\r\nascertain the variation. This table is to be found in the book called the\r\n\"Mariner's Compass Rectified;\" but more exactly in the \"Connaissance des\r\nTems\" for 1778 and 1788, all of which are in the library of Congress.\r\nIt may perhaps be found in other books more easily procured, and will\r\nneed to be extracted only from 36½° to 40° degrees of latitude.\r\n\r\nIII. _The Astronomical Survey._ This is the most important of all\r\nthe operations; it is from this alone we are to expect real truth.\r\nMeasures and rhumbs taken on the special surface of the earth, cannot\r\nbe represented on a plain surface of paper without astronomical\r\ncorrections; and, paradoxical as it may seem, it is nevertheless true,\r\nthat we cannot know the relative position of two places on the earth,\r\nbut by interrogating the sun, moon, and stars. The observer must,\r\ntherefore, correctly fix, in longitude and latitude, all remarkable\r\npoints from distance to distance. Those to be selected of preference are\r\nthe confluences, rapids, falls and ferries of water courses, summits of\r\nmountains, towns, court-houses, and angles of counties, and where these\r\npoints are more than a third or half a degree distant, they should be\r\nsupplied by observations of other points, such as mills, bridges, passes\r\nthrough mountains, &c., for in our latitudes, half a degree makes a\r\ndifference of three-eighths of a mile in the length of the degree of\r\nlongitude. These points first laid down, the intermediate delineations\r\nto be transferred from the particular surveys to the general map, are\r\nadapted to them by contractions or dilatations. The observer will need a\r\nbest Hadley's circle of Broda's construction, by Troughton, if possible,\r\n(for they are since Ramsden's time,) and a best chronometer.\r\n\r\nVery possibly an equatorial may be needed. This instrument set to\r\nthe observed latitude, gives the meridian of the place. In the lunar\r\nobservations _at sea_ this element cannot be had, and in Europe _by\r\nland_, these observations are not resorted to for longitudes, because\r\nat their numerous fixed observations they are prepared for the better\r\nmethod of Jupiter's satellites. But here, where our geography is still\r\nto be fixed by a portable apparatus only, we are obliged to resort, as\r\nat sea, to the lunar observations, with the advantage, however, of a\r\nfixed meridian. And although the use of a meridian in these observations\r\nis a novelty, yet, placed under new circumstances, we must countervail\r\ntheir advantages by whatever new resources they offer. It is obvious\r\nthat the observed distance of the moon from the meridian of the place,\r\nand her calculated distance from that of Greenwich at the same instant,\r\ngive the difference of meridians, without dependence on any measure of\r\ntime; by addition of the observations, if the moon be between the two\r\nmeridians, by subtraction if east or west of both; the association,\r\ntherefore, of this instrument with the circular one, by introducing\r\nanother element, another process and another instrument, furnishes a test\r\nof the observations with the Hadley, adds to their certainty, and, by\r\nits corroborations, dispenses with that multiplication of observations\r\nwhich is necessary with the Hadley when used alone. This idea, however,\r\nis suggested by theory only; and it must be left to the judgment of the\r\nobserver who will be employed, whether it would be practicable and useful.\r\nTo him, when known, I shall be glad to give further explanations. The\r\ncost of the equatorial is about the same with that of the circle, when\r\nof equal workmanship.\r\n\r\nBoth the surveyor and astronomer should journalize their proceedings\r\ndaily, and send copies of their journals monthly to the Executive, as\r\nwell to prevent loss by accident, as to make known their progress.\r\n\r\nIV. _Mineralogical Survey._--I have never known in the United States but\r\none eminent mineralogist, who could have been engaged on hire. This was a\r\nMr. Goudon from France, who came over to Philadelphia six or seven years\r\nago. Being zealously devoted to the science, he proposed to explore the\r\nnew field which this country offered; but being scanty in means, as I\r\nunderstood, he meant to give lectures in the winter which might enable\r\nhim to pass the summer in mineralogical rambles. It is long since I\r\nhave heard his name mentioned, and therefore do not know whether he is\r\nstill at Philadelphia, or even among the living. The literary gentlemen\r\nof that place can give the information, or perhaps point out some other\r\nequal to the undertaking.\r\n\r\nI believe I have now, Sir, gone over all the subjects of your\r\nletter,--which I have done with less reserve to multiply the chances of\r\noffering here and there something which might be useful. Its greatest\r\nmerit, however, will be that of evidencing my respect for your commands,\r\nand of adding to the proofs of my great consideration and esteem.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. DUPONT DE NEMOURS.\r\n\r\n                                             POPLAR FOREST, April 24, 1816.\r\n\r\nI received, my dear friend, your letter covering the constitution for\r\nyour Equinoctial republics, just as I was setting out for this place. I\r\nbrought it with me, and have read it with great satisfaction. I suppose\r\nit well formed for those for whom it was intended, and the excellence of\r\nevery government is its adaptation to the state of those to be governed\r\nby it. For us it would not do. Distinguishing between the structure\r\nof the government and the moral principles on which you prescribe its\r\nadministration, with the latter we concur cordially, with the former we\r\nshould not. We of the United States, you know, are constitutionally and\r\nconscientiously democrats. We consider society as one of the natural wants\r\nwith which man has been created; that he has been endowed with faculties\r\nand qualities to effect its satisfaction by concurrence of others\r\nhaving the same want; that when, by the exercise of these faculties, he\r\nhas procured a state of society, it is one of his acquisitions which\r\nhe has a right to regulate and control, jointly indeed with all those\r\nwho have concurred in the procurement, whom he cannot exclude from its\r\nuse or direction more than they him. We think experience has proved it\r\nsafer, for the mass of individuals composing the society, to reserve to\r\nthemselves personally the exercise of all rightful powers to which they\r\nare competent, and to delegate those to which they are not competent\r\nto deputies named, and removable for unfaithful conduct, by themselves\r\nimmediately. Hence, with us, the people (by which is meant the mass\r\nof individuals composing the society) being competent to judge of the\r\nfacts occurring in ordinary life, they have retained the functions of\r\njudges of facts, under the name of jurors; but being unqualified for the\r\nmanagement of affairs requiring intelligence above the common level, yet\r\ncompetent judges of human character, they chose, for their management,\r\nrepresentatives, some by themselves immediately, others by electors chosen\r\nby themselves. Thus our President is chosen by ourselves, directly in\r\n_practice_, for we vote for A as elector only on the condition he will\r\nvote for B, our representatives by ourselves immediately, our Senate\r\nand judges of law through electors chosen by ourselves. And we believe\r\nthat this proximate choice and power of removal is the best security\r\nwhich experience has sanctioned for ensuring an honest conduct in the\r\nfunctionaries of society. Your three or four alembications have indeed\r\na seducing appearance. We should conceive, _primá facie_, that the last\r\nextract would be the pure alcohol of the substance, three or four times\r\nrectified. But in proportion as they are more and more sublimated, they\r\nare also farther and farther removed from the control of the society;\r\nand the human character, we believe, requires in general constant\r\nand immediate control, to prevent its being biased from right by the\r\nseductions of self-love. Your process produces therefore a structure of\r\ngovernment from which the fundamental principle of ours is excluded. You\r\nfirst set down as zeros all individuals not having lands, which are the\r\ngreater number in every society of long standing. Those holding lands\r\nare permitted to manage in person the small affairs of their commune or\r\ncorporation, and to elect a deputy for the canton; in which election,\r\ntoo, every one's vote is to be an unit, a plurality, or a fraction, in\r\nproportion to his landed possessions. The assemblies of cantons, then,\r\nelect for the districts; those of districts for circles; and those of\r\ncircles for the national assemblies. Some of these highest councils,\r\ntoo, are in a considerable degree self-elected, the regency partially,\r\nthe judiciary entirely, and some are for life. Whenever, therefore, an\r\n_esprit de corps_, or of party, gets possession of them, which experience\r\nshows to be inevitable, there are no means of breaking it up, for they\r\nwill never elect but those of their own spirit. Juries are allowed in\r\ncriminal cases only. I acknowledge myself strong in affection to our own\r\nform, yet both of us act and think from the same motive, we both consider\r\nthe people as our children, and love them with parental affection. But\r\nyou love them as infants whom you are afraid to trust without nurses;\r\nand I as adults whom I freely leave to self-government. And you are\r\nright in the case referred to you; my criticism being built on a state\r\nof society not under your contemplation. It is, in fact, like a critic\r\non Homer by the laws of the Drama.\r\n\r\nBut when we come to the moral principles on which the government is to be\r\nadministered, we come to what is proper for all conditions of society.\r\nI meet you there in all the benevolence and rectitude of your native\r\ncharacter; and I love myself always most where I concur most with you.\r\nLiberty, truth, probity, honor, are declared to be the four cardinal\r\nprinciples of your society. I believe with you that morality, compassion,\r\ngenerosity, are innate elements of the human constitution; that there\r\nexists a right independent of force; that a right to property is founded\r\nin our natural wants, in the means with which we are endowed to satisfy\r\nthese wants, and the right to what we acquire by those means without\r\nviolating the similar rights of other sensible beings; that no one has a\r\nright to obstruct another, exercising his faculties innocently for the\r\nrelief of sensibilities made a part of his nature; that justice is the\r\nfundamental law of society; that the majority, oppressing an individual,\r\nis guilty of a crime, abuses its strength, and by acting on the law of\r\nthe strongest breaks up the foundations of society; that action by the\r\ncitizens in person, in affairs within their reach and competence, and\r\nin all others by representatives, chosen immediately, and removable by\r\nthemselves, constitutes the essence of a republic; that all governments\r\nare more or less republican in proportion as this principle enters more\r\nor less into their composition; and that a government by representation\r\nis capable of extension over a greater surface of country than one of\r\nany other form. These, my friend, are the essentials in which you and I\r\nagree; however, in our zeal for their maintenance, we may be perplexed\r\nand divaricate, as to the structure of society most likely to secure them.\r\n\r\nIn the constitution of Spain, as proposed by the late Cortes, there\r\nwas a principle entirely new to me, and not noticed in yours, that\r\nno person, born after that day, should ever acquire the rights of\r\ncitizenship until he could read and write. It is impossible sufficiently\r\nto estimate the wisdom of this provision. Of all those which have\r\nbeen thought of for securing fidelity in the administration of the\r\ngovernment, constant ralliance to the principles of the constitution,\r\nand progressive amendments with the progressive advances of the human\r\nmind, or changes in human affairs, it is the most effectual. Enlighten\r\nthe people generally, and tyranny and oppressions of body and mind will\r\nvanish like evil spirits at the dawn of day. Although I do not, with some\r\nenthusiasts, believe that the human condition will ever advance to such\r\na state of perfection as that there shall no longer be pain or vice in\r\nthe world, yet I believe it susceptible of much improvement, and most\r\nof all, in matters of government and religion; and that the diffusion\r\nof knowledge among the people is to be the instrument by which it is\r\nto be effected. The constitution of the Cortes had defects enough; but\r\nwhen I saw in it this amendatory provision, I was satisfied all would\r\ncome right in time, under its salutary operation. No people have more\r\nneed of a similar provision than those for whom you have felt so much\r\ninterest. No mortal wishes them more success than I do. But if what I have\r\nheard of the ignorance and bigotry of the mass be true, I doubt their\r\ncapacity to understand and to support a free government; and fear that\r\ntheir emancipation from the foreign tyranny of Spain, will result in a\r\nmilitary despotism at home. Palacios may be great; others may be great;\r\nbut it is the multitude which possesses force; and wisdom must yield to\r\nthat. For such a condition of society, the constitution you have devised\r\nis probably the best imaginable. It is certainly calculated to elicit\r\nthe best talents; although perhaps not well guarded against the egoism\r\nof its functionaries. But that egoism will be light in comparison with\r\nthe pressure of a military despot, and his army of Janissaries. Like\r\nSolon to the Athenians, you have given to your Columbians, not the best\r\npossible government, but the best they can bear. By-the-bye, I wish you\r\nhad called them the Columbian republics, to distinguish them from our\r\nAmerican republics. Theirs would be the most honorable name, and they\r\nbest entitled to it; for Columbus discovered their continent, but never\r\nsaw ours.\r\n\r\nTo them liberty and happiness; to you the meed of wisdom and goodness\r\nin teaching them how to attain them, with the affectionate respect and\r\nfriendship of,\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. FR. ADR. VANDERKEMP.\r\n\r\n                                             POPLAR FOREST, April 25, 1816.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your favor of March 24th was handed to me just as I was setting out\r\non a journey of time and distance, which will explain the date of this\r\nboth as to time and place. The Syllabus, which is the subject of your\r\nletter, was addressed to a friend to whom I had promised a more detailed\r\nview. But finding I should never have time for that, I sent him what I\r\nthought should be the outlines of such a work; the same subject entering\r\nsometimes into the correspondence between Mr. Adams and myself, I sent\r\nhim a copy of it. The friend to whom it had been first addressed, dying\r\nsoon after, I asked from his family the return of the original, as a\r\nconfidential communication, which they kindly sent me. So that no copy\r\nof it, but that in the possession of Mr. Adams, now exists out of my\r\nown hands. I have used this caution lest it should get out in connection\r\nwith my name; and I was unwilling to draw on myself a swarm of insects,\r\nwhose buzz is more disquieting than their bite. As an abstract thing,\r\nand without any intimation from what quarter derived, I can have no\r\nobjection to its being committed to the consideration of the world. I\r\nbelieve it may even do good by producing discussion, and finally a true\r\nview of the merits of this great reformer. Pursuing the same ideas after\r\nwriting the Syllabus, I made, for my own satisfaction, an extract from\r\nthe Evangelists of his morals, selecting those only whose style and\r\nspirit proved them genuine, and his own; and they are as distinguishable\r\nfrom the matter in which they are imbedded as diamonds in dunghills. A\r\nmore precious morsel in ethics was never seen. It was too hastily done,\r\nhowever, being the work of one or two evenings only, while I lived at\r\nWashington, overwhelmed with other business, and it is my intention to\r\ngo over it again at more leisure. This shall be the work of the ensuing\r\nwinter. I gave it the title of \"the Philosophy of Jesus extracted from\r\nthe text of the Evangelists.\" To this Syllabus and extract, if a history\r\nof his life can be added, written with the same view of the subject, the\r\nworld will see, after the fogs shall be dispelled, in which for fourteen\r\ncenturies he has been enveloped by jugglers to make money of him, when\r\nthe genuine character shall be exhibited, which they have dressed up\r\nin the rags of an imposter, the world, I say, will at length see the\r\nimmortal merit of this first of human sages. I rejoice that you think\r\nof undertaking this work. It is one I have long wished to see written\r\nof the scale of a Laertius or a Nepos. Nor can it be a work of labor,\r\nor of volume, for his journeyings from Judea to Samaria, and Samaria\r\nto Galilee, do not cover much country; and the incidents of his life\r\nrequire little research. They are all at hand, and need only to be put\r\ninto human dress; noticing such only as are within the physical laws\r\nof nature, and offending none by a denial or even a mention of what is\r\nnot. If the Syllabus and Extract (which is short) either in substance,\r\nor at large, are worth a place under the same cover with your biography,\r\nthey are at your service. I ask one only condition, that no possibility\r\nshall be admitted of my name being even intimated with the publication.\r\nIf done in England, as you seem to contemplate, there will be the less\r\nlikelihood of my being thought of. I shall be much gratified to learn\r\nthat you pursue your intention of writing the life of Jesus, and pray\r\nyou to accept the assurances of my great respect and esteem.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. CORREA DE SERRA.\r\n\r\n                                             POPLAR FOREST, April 26, 1816.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of March 29th was received, just as I was setting\r\nout for this place. I brought it with me to be answered hence. Since you\r\nare so kind as to interest yourself for Captain Lewis' papers, I will\r\ngive you a full statement of them.\r\n\r\n1. Ten or twelve such pocket volumes, morocco bound, as that you describe,\r\nin which, in his own hand-writing, he had journalized all occurrences,\r\nday by day, as he travelled. They were small 8vos, and opened at the\r\nend for more convenient writing. Every one had been put into a separate\r\ntin case, cemented to prevent injury from wet, but on his return the\r\ncases, I presume, had been taken from them, as he delivered me the books\r\nuncased. There were in them the figures of some animals, drawn with the\r\npen while on his journey. The gentleman who published his travels must\r\nhave had these MS. volumes, and perhaps now has them, or can give some\r\naccount of them.\r\n\r\n2. Descriptions of animals and plants. I do not recollect whether there\r\nwas such a book or collection of papers, distinct from his journal,\r\nalthough I am inclined to think there was one: because his travels as\r\npublished, do not contain all the new animals of which he had either\r\ndescriptions or specimens. Mr. Peale, I think, must know something of\r\nthis, as he drew figures of some of the animals for engraving, and some\r\nwere actually engraved. Perhaps Conrad, his bookseller, who was to have\r\npublished the work, can give an account of these.\r\n\r\n3. Vocabularies. I had myself made a collection of about forty\r\nvocabularies of the Indians on this side of the Mississippi, and Captain\r\nLewis was instructed to take those of every tribe beyond, which he\r\npossibly could. The intention was to publish the whole, and leave the\r\nworld to search for affinities between these and the languages of Europe\r\nand Asia. He was furnished with a number of printed vocabularies of the\r\nsame words and form I had used, with blank spaces for the Indian words.\r\nHe was very attentive to this instruction, never missing an opportunity\r\nof taking a vocabulary. After his return, he asked me if I should have\r\nany objection to the printing his separately, as mine were not yet\r\narranged as I intended. I assured him I had not the least; and I am\r\ncertain he contemplated their publication. But whether he had put the\r\npapers out of his own hand or not, I do not know. I imagine he had not;\r\nand it is probable that Doctor Barton, who was particularly curious on\r\nthis subject, and published on it occasionally, would willingly receive\r\nand take care of these papers after Captain Lewis' death, and that they\r\nare now among his papers.\r\n\r\n4. His observations of longitude and latitude. He was instructed to\r\nsend these to the War-Office, that measures might be taken to have\r\nthe calculations made. Whether he delivered them to the War-Office, or\r\nto Dr. Patterson, I do not know, but I think he communicated with Dr.\r\nPatterson concerning them. These are all important, because although,\r\nhaving with him the nautical almanacs, he could and did calculate some\r\nof his latitudes, yet the longitudes were taken merely from estimates\r\nby the log-line, time, and course. So that it is only as latitudes that\r\nhis map may be considered as tolerably correct; not as to its longitudes.\r\n\r\n5. His Map. This was drawn on sheets of paper, not put together, but so\r\nmarked that they could be joined together with the utmost accuracy; not\r\nas one great square map, but ramifying with the courses of the rivers.\r\nThe scale was very large, and the sheets numerous, but in perfect\r\npreservation. This was to await publication, until corrected by the\r\ncalculations of longitude and latitude. I examined these sheets myself\r\nminutely, as spread on a floor, and the originals must be in existence,\r\nas the map published with his travels must have been taken from them.\r\n\r\nThese constitute the whole. They are the property of the government, the\r\nfruits of the expedition undertaken at such expense of money, and risk of\r\nvaluable lives. They contain exactly the whole of the information which\r\nit was our object to obtain, for the benefit of our own country and of the\r\nworld. But we were willing to give to Lewis and Clarke whatever pecuniary\r\nbenefits might be derived from the publication, and therefore left the\r\npapers in their hands, taking for granted that their interests would\r\nproduce a speedy publication, which would be better if done under their\r\ndirection. But the death of Captain Lewis, the distance and occupations\r\nof General Clarke, and the bankruptcy of their bookseller, have retarded\r\nthe publication, and rendered it necessary that the government should\r\nattend to the reclamation and security of the papers; their recovery\r\nis now become an imperious duty. Their safest deposit, as fast as they\r\ncan be collected, will be the Philosophical Society, who no doubt will\r\nbe so kind as to receive and preserve them, subject to the orders of\r\ngovernment; and their publication once effected in any way, the originals\r\nwill probably be left in the same deposit. As soon as I can learn their\r\npresent situation, I will lay the matter before the government to take\r\nsuch order as they think proper. As to any claims of individuals to\r\nthese papers, it is to be observed that, as being the property of the\r\npublic, we are certain neither Lewis nor Clarke would undertake to convey\r\naway the right to them, had they been capable of intending it. Yet no\r\ninterest of that kind is meant to be disturbed, if the individual can\r\ngive satisfactory assurance that he will promptly and properly publish\r\nthem; otherwise they must be restored to the government, and the claimant\r\nleft to settle with those on whom he has any claim. My interference,\r\nwill, I trust, be excused, not only from the portion which every citizen\r\nhas in whatever is public, but from the peculiar part I have had in the\r\ndesign and execution of this expedition.\r\n\r\nTo you, my friend, apology is due for involving you in the trouble of\r\nthis inquiry. It must be found in the interest you take in whatever\r\nbelongs to science, and in your own kind offers to me of aid in this\r\nresearch. Be assured always of my affectionate friendship and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS TO THOMAS JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n                                                       QUINCY, May 3, 1816.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Yours of April 8th has long since been received.\r\n\r\n_J._ \"Would you agree to live your eighty years over again?\"\r\n\r\n_A._ ----.\r\n\r\n_J._ \"Would you agree to live your eighty years over again forever?\"\r\n\r\n_A._ I once heard our acquaintance, Chew, of Philadelphia, say, \"he\r\nshould like to go back to twenty-five, to all eternity;\" but I own my\r\nsoul would start and shrink back on itself at the prospect of an endless\r\nsuccession of _Boules de Savon_, almost as much as at the certainty of\r\nannihilation. For what is human life? I can speak only for one. I have\r\nhad more comfort than distress, more pleasure than pain ten to one,\r\nnay, if you please, an hundred to one. A pretty large dose, however,\r\nof distress and pain. But after all, what is human life? A vapor, a\r\nfog, a dew, a cloud, a blossom, a flower, a rose, a blade of grass, a\r\nglass bubble, a tale told by an idiot, a _Boule de Savon_, vanity of\r\nvanities, an eternal succession of which would terrify me almost as much\r\nas annihilation.\r\n\r\n_J._ \"Would you prefer to live over again, rather than accept the offer\r\nof a better life in a future state?\"\r\n\r\n_A._ Certainly not.\r\n\r\n_J._ \"Would you live again rather than change for the worse in a future\r\nstate, for the sake of trying something new?\"\r\n\r\n_A._ Certainly yes.\r\n\r\n_J._ \"Would you live over again once or forever, rather than run the\r\nrisk of annihilation, or of a better or a worse state at or after death?\"\r\n\r\n_A._ Most certainly I would not.\r\n\r\n_J._ \"How valiant you are!\"\r\n\r\n_A._ Aye, at this moment, and at all other moments of my life that I\r\ncan recollect; but who can tell what will become of his bravery when\r\nhis flesh and his heart shall fail him? Bolingbroke said \"his philosophy\r\nwas not sufficient to support him in his last hours.\" D'Alembert said:\r\n\"Happy are they who have courage, but I have none.\" Voltaire, the greatest\r\ngenius of them all, behaved like the greatest coward of them all at his\r\ndeath, as he had like the wisest fool of them all in his lifetime. Hume\r\nawkwardly affected to sport away all sober thoughts. Who can answer\r\nfor his last feelings and reflections, especially as the priests are in\r\npossession of the custom of making them the greatest engines of their\r\ncraft. _Procul est prophani!_\r\n\r\n_J._ \"How shall we, how can we estimate the real value of human life?\"\r\n\r\n_A._ I know not; I cannot weigh sensations and reflections, pleasures and\r\npains, hopes and fears, in money-scales. But I can tell you how I have\r\nheard it estimated by philosophers. One of my old friends and clients,\r\na mandamus counsellor against his will, a man of letters and virtues,\r\nwithout one vice that I ever knew or suspected, except garrulity, William\r\nVassall, asserted to me, and strenuously maintained, that \"_pleasure is\r\nno compensation for pain_.\" \"An hundred years of the keenest delights\r\nof human life could not atone for one hour of bilious cholic that he\r\nhad felt.\" The sublimity of this philosophy my dull genius could not\r\nreach. I was willing to state a fair account between pleasure and pain,\r\nand give credit for the balance, which I found very great in my favor.\r\n\r\nAnother philosopher, who, as we say, believed nothing, ridiculed the\r\nnotion of a future state. One of the company asked, \"Why are you an enemy\r\nto a future state? Are you weary of life? Do you detest existence?\" \"Weary\r\nof life? Detest existence?\" said the philosopher. \"No! I love life so\r\nwell, and am so attached to existence, that to be sure of immortality, I\r\nwould consent to be pitched about with forks by the devils, among flames\r\nof fire and brimstone, to all eternity.\"\r\n\r\nI find no resources in my courage for this exalted philosophy. I had\r\nrather be blotted out.\r\n\r\n_Il faut trancher cet mot!_ What is there in life to attach us to it\r\nbut the hope of a future and a better? It is a cracker, a rocket, a\r\nfire-work at best.\r\n\r\nI admire your navigation, and should like to sail with you, either in\r\nyour bark, or in my own along side of yours. Hope with her gay ensigns\r\ndisplayed at the prow, fear with her hobgoblins behind the stern. Hope\r\nsprings eternal, and hope is all that endures. Take away hope and what\r\nremains? What pleasure, I mean? Take away fear and what pain remains?\r\nNinety-nine one hundredths of the pleasures and pains of life are nothing\r\nbut hopes and fears.\r\n\r\nAll nations known in history or in travels, have hoped, believed and\r\nexpected a future and a better state. The Maker of the Universe, the\r\ncause of all things, whether we call it _fate_, or _chance_, or God,\r\nhas inspired this hope. If it is a _fraud_, we shall never know it.\r\nWe shall never resent the imposition, be grateful for the illusion,\r\nnor grieve for the disappointment. We shall be no more. Credit Grimm,\r\nDiderot, Buffon, La Lande, Condorcet, D'Holbach, Frederick, Catharine;\r\n_non ego_. Arrogant as it may be, I shall take the liberty to pronounce\r\nthem all _Idiologians_. Yet I would not persecute a hair of their heads.\r\nThe world is wide enough for them and me.\r\n\r\nSuppose the cause of the universe should reveal to all mankind at once\r\na _certainty_ that they must all die within a century, and that death\r\nis an eternal extinction of all living powers, of all sensation and\r\nreflection. What would be the effect? Would there be one man, woman or\r\nchild existing on this globe, twenty years hence? Would not every human\r\nbeing be a Madame Deffand, Voltaire's \"Aveugle clairvoyante,\" all her\r\nlifetime regretting her existence, bewailing that she had ever been\r\nborn, grieving that she had ever been dragged, without her consent, into\r\nbeing. Who would bear the gout, the stone, the cholic, for the sake of a\r\n_Boule de Savon_, when a pistol, a cord, a pond, or a phial of laudanum\r\nwas at hand? What would men say to their Maker? Would they thank him?\r\nNo; they would reproach him; they would curse him to his face. Voila!\r\n\r\nA sillier letter than my last. For a wonder, I have filled a sheet, and\r\na greater wonder, I have read fifteen volumes of Grimm. _Digito comesse\r\nlabellum_. I hope to write you more upon this and other topics of your\r\nletter. I have read also a History of the Jesuits, in four volumes. Can\r\nyou tell me the author, or anything of this work?\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS TO THOMAS JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n                                                       QUINCY, May 6, 1816.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Neither eyes, fingers or paper held out to despatch all the\r\ntrifles I wished to write in my last letter.\r\n\r\nIn your favor of April 8th you \"wonder for what good end the sensations\r\nof grief could be intended?\" \"You wish the Pathologists would tell us,\r\nwhat the use of grief in our economy, and of what good it is the cause\r\nproximate or remote.\" When I approach such questions as this, I consider\r\nmyself, like one of those little eels in Vinaigre, or one of those\r\nanimalcules in black or red paper, or in the horse-radish root, that\r\nbite our tongues so cruelly, reasoning upon the το παν. Of what use is\r\nthis sting upon the tongue? Why might we not have the benefit of these\r\nstimulants, without the sting? Why might we not have the fragrance and\r\nbeauty of the rose without the thorn?\r\n\r\nIn the first place, however, we know not the connection between pleasure\r\nand pain. They seem to be mechanical and inseparable. How can we conceive\r\na strong passion, a sanguine hope suddenly disappointed, without producing\r\npain, or grief? Swift at seventy, recollected the fish he had angled out\r\nof water when a boy, which broke loose from his hook; and said I feel\r\nthe disappointment at this moment. A merchant places all his fortune\r\nand all his credit in a single India or China ship. She arrives at the\r\nvineyard with a cargo worth a million, in order. Sailing round a Cape\r\nfor Boston, a sudden storm wrecks her--ship, cargo and crew, all lost.\r\nIs it possible that the merchant ruined, bankrupt, sent to prison by his\r\ncreditors--his wife and children starving--should not grieve? Suppose a\r\nyoung couple, with every advantage of persons, fortunes and connections,\r\non the point of indissoluble union. A flash of lightning, or any one of\r\nthose millions of accidents which are allotted to humanity, proves fatal\r\nto one of the lovers. Is it possible that the other, and all the friends\r\nof both, should not grieve? It seems that grief, as a mere passion, must\r\nbe in proportion to sensibility.\r\n\r\nDid you ever see a portrait, or a statue of a great man, without\r\nperceiving strong traits of pain and anxiety? These furrows were all\r\nploughed in the countenance, by grief. Our juridical oracle, Sir Edward\r\nCoke, thought that none were fit for legislators and magistrates, but\r\n\"_sad men_\" And who were these sad men? They were aged men, who had been\r\ntossed and buffeted in the vicissitudes of life--forced upon profound\r\nreflection by grief and disappointments--and taught to command their\r\npassions and prejudices.\r\n\r\nBut all this you will say is nothing to the purpose. It is only repeating\r\nand exemplifying a _fact_, which my question supposed to be well known,\r\nviz., the existence of grief; and is no answer to my question, \"what\r\nare the uses of grief.\" This is very true, and you are very right; but\r\nmay not the uses of grief be inferred, or at least suggested by such\r\nexemplifications of known facts? Grief compels the India merchant to\r\nthink; to reflect upon the plans of his voyage. Have I not been rash,\r\nto trust my fortune, my family, my liberty, to the caprices of winds and\r\nwaves in a single ship? I will never again give a loose to my imagination\r\nand avarice. It had been wiser and more honest to have traded on a\r\nsmaller scale upon my own capital.\r\n\r\nThe desolated lover, and disappointed connections, are compelled by their\r\ngrief to reflect on the vanity of human wishes and expectations; to learn\r\nthe essential lesson of resignation; to review their own conduct towards\r\nthe deceased; to correct any errors or faults in their future conduct\r\ntowards their remaining friends, and towards all men; to recollect the\r\nvirtues of the lost friend, and resolve to imitate them; his follies\r\nand vices if he had any, and resolve to avoid them.\r\n\r\nGrief drives men into habits of serious reflection, sharpens the\r\nunderstanding, and softens the heart; it compels them to arouse their\r\nreason, to assert its empire over their passions, propensities and\r\nprejudices; to elevate them to a superiority over all human events; to\r\ngive them the _felicis annimi immota tranquilitatum_; in short, to make\r\nthem stoics and Christians. After all, as grief is a pain, it stands in\r\nthe predicament of all other evil, and the great question occurs, what\r\nis the origin, and what the final cause of evil. This perhaps is known\r\nonly to omniscience. We poor mortals have nothing to do with it--but\r\nto fabricate all the good we can out of all inevitable evils--and to\r\navoid all that are avoidable, and many such there are, among which are\r\nour own unnecessary apprehensions and imaginary fears. Though stoical\r\napathy is impossible, yet patience, and resignation, and tranquillity\r\nmay be acquired by consideration, in a great degree, very much for the\r\nhappiness of life.\r\n\r\nI have read Grimm, in fifteen volumes, of more than five hundred pages\r\neach. I will not say like uncle Toby, \"You shall not die till you have\r\nread him.\" But you ought to read him, if possible. It is the most\r\nentertaining work I ever read. He appears exactly as you represent\r\nhim. What is most remarkable of all is his impartiality. He spares\r\nno characters but Necker and Diderot. Voltaire, Buffon, D'Alembert,\r\nHelvetius, Rousseau, Marmontel, Condorcet, La Harpe, Beaumarchais, and all\r\nothers, are lashed without ceremony. Their portraits as faithfully drawn\r\nas possible. It is a complete review of French literature and fine arts\r\nfrom 1753 to 1790. No politics. Criticisms very just. Anecdotes without\r\nnumber, and very merry. One ineffably ridiculous, I wish I could send\r\nyou, but it is immeasurably long. D'Argens, a little out of health and\r\nshivering with the cold in Berlin, asked leave of the King to take a ride\r\nto Gascony, his native province. He was absent so long that Frederick\r\nconcluded the air of the south of France was like to detain his friend;\r\nand as he wanted his society and services, he contrived a trick to bring\r\nhim back. He fabricated a mandement in the name of the Archbishop of\r\nAix, commanding all the faithful to seize the Marquis D'Argens, author\r\nof Ocellus, Timæus and Julian, works atheistical, deistical, heretical\r\nand impious in the highest degree. This mandement, composed in a style\r\nof ecclesiastical eloquence that never was exceeded by Pope, Jesuit,\r\nInquisitor, or Sorbonite, he sent in print by a courier to D'Argens,\r\nwho, frightened out of his wit, fled by cross roads out of France and\r\nback to Berlin, to the greater joy of the philosophical court; for the\r\nlaugh of Europe, which they had raised at the expense of the learned\r\nMarquis.\r\n\r\nI do not like the late resurrection of the Jesuits. They have a general\r\nnow in Russia, in correspondence with the Jesuits in the United States,\r\nwho are more numerous than everybody knows. Shall we not have swarms\r\nof them here? In as many shapes and disguises as ever a king of the\r\nGypsies--Bamfield Morecarew himself, assumed? In the shape of printers,\r\neditors, writers, schoolmasters, &c. I have lately read Pascal's letters\r\nover again, and four volumes of the history of the Jesuits. If ever any\r\ncongregation of men could merit eternal perdition on earth and in hell,\r\naccording to these historians, though like Pascal true Catholics, it\r\nis this company Loyola. Our system, however, of religious liberty must\r\nafford them an asylum. But if they do not put the purity of our elections\r\nto a severe trial, it will be a wonder.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN TAYLOR.\r\n\r\n                                                  MONTICELLO, May 28, 1816.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--On my return from a long journey and considerable absence from\r\nhome, I found here the copy of your \"Enquiry into the principles of our\r\ngovernment,\" which you had been so kind as to send me; and for which I\r\npray you to accept my thanks. The difficulties of getting new works in\r\nour situation, inland and without a single bookstore, are such as had\r\nprevented my obtaining a copy before; and letters which had accumulated\r\nduring my absence, and were calling for answers, have not yet permitted\r\nme to give to the whole a thorough reading; yet certain that you and I\r\ncould not think differently on the fundamentals of rightful government,\r\nI was impatient, and availed myself of the intervals of repose from the\r\nwriting table, to obtain a cursory idea of the body of the work.\r\n\r\nI see in it much matter for profound reflection; much which should confirm\r\nour adhesion, in practice, to the good principles of our constitution,\r\nand fix our attention on what is yet to be made good. The sixth section\r\non the good moral principles of our government, I found so interesting\r\nand replete with sound principles, as to postpone my letter-writing to\r\nits thorough perusal and consideration. Besides much other good matter,\r\nit settles unanswerably the right of instructing representatives, and\r\ntheir duty to obey. The system of banking we have both equally and ever\r\nreprobated. I contemplate it as a blot left in all our constitutions,\r\nwhich, if not covered, will end in their destruction, which is already\r\nhit by the gamblers in corruption, and is sweeping away in its progress\r\nthe fortunes and morals of our citizens. Funding I consider as limited,\r\nrightfully, to a redemption of the debt within the lives of a majority\r\nof the generation contracting it; every generation coming equally, by the\r\nlaws of the Creator of the world, to the free possession of the earth he\r\nmade for their subsistence, unincumbered by their predecessors, who, like\r\nthem, were but tenants for life. You have successfully and completely\r\npulverized Mr. Adams' system of orders, and his opening the mantle of\r\nrepublicanism to every government of laws, whether consistent or not with\r\nnatural right. Indeed, it must be acknowledged, that the term _republic_\r\nis of very vague application in every language. Witness the self-styled\r\nrepublics of Holland, Switzerland, Genoa, Venice, Poland. Were I to\r\nassign to this term a precise and definite idea, I would say, purely and\r\nsimply, it means a government by its citizens in mass, acting directly\r\nand personally, according to rules established by the majority; and that\r\nevery other government is more or less republican, in proportion as it\r\nhas in its composition more or less of this ingredient of the direct\r\naction of the citizens. Such a government is evidently restrained to very\r\nnarrow limits of space and population. I doubt if it would be practicable\r\nbeyond the extent of a New England township. The first shade from this\r\npure element, which, like that of pure vital air, cannot sustain life\r\nof itself, would be where the powers of the government, being divided,\r\nshould be exercised each by representatives chosen either _pro hac vice_,\r\nor for such short terms as should render secure the duty of expressing\r\nthe will of their constituents. This I should consider as the nearest\r\napproach to a pure republic, which is practicable on a large scale of\r\ncountry or population. And we have examples of it in some of our State\r\nconstitutions, which, if not poisoned by priest-craft, would prove its\r\nexcellence over all mixtures with other elements; and, with only equal\r\ndoses of poison, would still be the best. Other shades of republicanism\r\nmay be found in other forms of government, where the executive, judiciary\r\nand legislative functions, and the different branches of the latter,\r\nare chosen by the people more or less directly, for longer terms of\r\nyears, or for life, or made hereditary; or where there are mixtures of\r\nauthorities, some dependent on, and others independent of the people. The\r\nfurther the departure from direct and constant control by the citizens,\r\nthe less has the government of the ingredient of republicanism; evidently\r\nnone where the authorities are hereditary, as in France, Venice, &c.,\r\nor self-chosen, as in Holland; and little, where for life, in proportion\r\nas the life continues in being after the act of election.\r\n\r\nThe purest republican feature in the government of our own State, is the\r\nHouse of Representatives. The Senate is equally so the first year, less\r\nthe second, and so on. The Executive still less, because not chosen by\r\nthe people directly. The Judiciary seriously anti-republican, because for\r\nlife; and the national arm wielded, as you observe, by military leaders,\r\nirresponsible but to themselves. Add to this the vicious constitution of\r\nour county courts (to whom the justice, the executive administration, the\r\ntaxation, police, the military appointments of the county, and nearly\r\nall our daily concerns are confided), self-appointed, self-continued,\r\nholding their authorities for life, and with an impossibility of breaking\r\nin on the perpetual succession of any faction once possessed of the\r\nbench. They are in truth, the executive, the judiciary, and the military\r\nof their respective counties, and the sum of the counties makes the\r\nState. And add, also, that one half of our brethren who fight and pay\r\ntaxes, are excluded, like Helots, from the rights of representation, as\r\nif society were instituted for the soil, and not for the men inhabiting\r\nit; or one half of these could dispose of the rights and the will of\r\nthe other half, without their consent.\r\n\r\n           \"What constitutes a State?\r\n     Not high-raised battlements, or labor'd mound,\r\n           Thick wall, or moated gate;\r\n     Not cities proud, with spires and turrets crown'd;\r\n           No: men, high minded men;\r\n           Men, who their duties know;\r\n     But know their rights; and knowing, dare maintain.\r\n           These constitute a State.\"\r\n\r\nIn the General Government, the House of Representatives is mainly\r\nrepublican; the Senate scarcely so at all, as not elected by the people\r\ndirectly, and so long secured even against those who do elect them; the\r\nExecutive more republican than the Senate, from its shorter term, its\r\nelection by the people, in practice, (for they vote for A only on an\r\nassurance that he will vote for B,) and because, _in practice also_,\r\na principle of rotation seems to be in a course of establishment; the\r\njudiciary independent of the nation, their coercion by impeachment being\r\nfound nugatory.\r\n\r\nIf, then, the control of the people over the organs of their government be\r\nthe measure of its republicanism, and I confess I know no other measure,\r\nit must be agreed that our governments have much less of republicanism\r\nthan ought to have been expected; in other words, that the people have\r\nless regular control over their agents, than their rights and their\r\ninterests require. And this I ascribe, not to any want of republican\r\ndispositions in those who formed these constitutions, but to a submission\r\nof true principle to European authorities, to speculators on government,\r\nwhose fears of the people have been inspired by the populace of their\r\nown great cities, and were unjustly entertained against the independent,\r\nthe happy, and therefore orderly citizens of the United States. Much I\r\napprehend that the golden moment is past for reforming these heresies.\r\nThe functionaries of public power rarely strengthen in their dispositions\r\nto abridge it, and an unorganized call for timely amendment is not\r\nlikely to prevail against an organized opposition to it. We are always\r\ntold that things are going on well: why change them? \"_Chi sta\r\nbene, non si muove_,\" said the Italian, \"let him who stands well, stand\r\nstill.\" This is true; and I verily believe they would go on well with\r\nus under an absolute monarch, while our present character remains, of\r\norder, industry and love of peace, and restrained, as he would be, by\r\nthe proper spirit of the people. But it is while it remains such, we\r\nshould provide against the consequences of its deterioration. And let\r\nus rest in the hope that it will yet be done, and spare ourselves the\r\npain of evils which may never happen.\r\n\r\nOn this view of the import of the term _republic_, instead of saying, as\r\nhas been said, \"that it may mean anything or nothing,\" we may say with\r\ntruth and meaning, that governments are more or less republican, as they\r\nhave more or less of the element of popular election and control in their\r\ncomposition; and believing, as I do, that the mass of the citizens is the\r\nsafest depository of their own rights, and especially, that the evils\r\nflowing from the duperies of the people, are less injurious than those\r\nfrom the egoism of their agents, I am a friend to that composition of\r\ngovernment which has in it the most of this ingredient. And I sincerely\r\nbelieve, with you, that banking establishments are more dangerous than\r\nstanding armies; and that the principle of spending money to be paid\r\nby posterity, under the name of funding, is but swindling futurity on\r\na large scale.\r\n\r\nI salute you with constant friendship and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX TO VOL.
