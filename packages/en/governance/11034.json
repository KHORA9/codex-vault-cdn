RICHARDSON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMartin Van Buren\r\n\r\nMarch 4, 1837, to March 4, 1841\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMartin Van Buren\r\n\r\nMartin Van Buren was born in Kinderhook, Columbia County, N.Y., December\r\n5, 1782. He was the eldest son of Abraham Van Buren, a small farmer, and\r\nof Mary Hoes (originally spelled Goes), whose first husband was named\r\nVan Alen. He studied the rudiments of English and Latin in the schools\r\nof his native village. At the age of 14 years commenced reading law in\r\nthe office of Francis Sylvester, and pursued his legal novitiate for\r\nseven years. Combining with his professional studies a fondness\r\nfor extemporaneous debate, he was early noted for his intelligent\r\nobservation of public events and for his interest in politics; was\r\nchosen to participate in a nominating convention when only 18 years old.\r\nIn 1802 went to New York City and studied law with William P. Van Ness,\r\na friend of Aaron Burr; was admitted to the bar in 1803, returned to\r\nKinderhook, and associated himself in practice with his half-brother,\r\nJames I. Van Alen. He was a zealous adherent of Jefferson, and supported\r\nMorgan Lewis for governor of New York in 1803 against Aaron Burr. In\r\nFebruary, 1807, he married Hannah Hoes, a distant kinswoman. In the\r\nwinter of 1806-7 removed to Hudson, the county seat of Columbia County,\r\nand in the same year was admitted to practice in the supreme court.\r\nIn 1807 supported Daniel D. Tompkins for governor against Morgan Lewis,\r\nthe latter having come to be considered less true than the former to\r\nthe measures of Jefferson. In 1808 became surrogate of Columbia County,\r\ndisplacing his halt-brother and partner, who belonged to the defeated\r\nfaction. In 1813, on a change of party predominance at Albany, his\r\nhalf-brother was restored to the office. Early in 1811 he figured in the\r\ncouncils of his party at a convention held in Albany, when the proposed\r\nrecharter of the United States Bank was the leading question of Federal\r\npolitics. Though Albert Gallatin, Secretary of the Treasury, had\r\nrecommended a recharter, the predominant sentiment of the Republican\r\nparty was adverse to the measure. Van Buren shared in this hostility,\r\nand publicly lauded the \"Spartan firmness\" of George Clinton when as\r\nVice-President he gave his casting vote in the United States Senate\r\nagainst the bank bill, February 20, 1811. In 1812 was elected to the\r\nsenate of New York from the middle district as a Clinton Republican,\r\ndefeating Edward P. Livingston; took his seat in November of that year,\r\nand became thereby a member of the court of errors, then composed of\r\nsenators in connection with the chancellor and the supreme court. As\r\nsenator he strenuously opposed the charter of \"The Bank of America,\"\r\nwhich was then seeking to establish itself in New York and to take the\r\nplace of the United States Bank. Though counted among the adherents\r\nof Madison's Administration, and though committed to the policy of\r\ndeclaring war against Great Britain, he sided with the Republican\r\nmembers of the New York legislature in 1812, and supported De Witt\r\nClinton for the Presidency. In the following year, however, he dissolved\r\nhis political relations with Clinton and resumed the _entente\r\ncordiale_ with Madison's Administration. In 1815, while still a\r\nmember of the senate, was appointed attorney-general of the State,\r\nsuperseding the venerable Abraham Van Vechten. In 1816 was reelected to\r\nthe State senate, and, removing to Albany, formed a partnership with his\r\nlife-long friend, Benjamin F. Butler. In the same year was appointed\r\na regent of the University of New York. Supported De Witt Clinton for\r\ngovernor of New York in 1817, but opposed his reelection in 1820. In\r\n1819 was removed from the office of attorney-general. February 6, 1821,\r\nwas elected United States Senator. In the same year was chosen from\r\nOtsego County as a member of the convention to revise the constitution\r\nof the State. Took his seat in the United States Senate December 3,\r\n1821, and was at once made a member of its Committees on the Judiciary\r\nand Finance. For many years was chairman of the former. Supported\r\nWilliam H. Crawford for the Presidency in 1824. Was reelected to the\r\nSenate in 1827, but soon resigned his seat to accept the office of\r\ngovernor of New York, to which he was elected in 1828. Was a zealous\r\nsupporter of Andrew Jackson in the Presidential election of 1828, and in\r\n1829 became premier of the new Administration. As Secretary of State he\r\nbrought to a favorable close the long-standing feud between the United\r\nStates and England with regard to the West India trade. Resigned his\r\nSecretaryship in June, 1831, and was sent as minister to England. The\r\nSenate refused in 1832 to confirm his nomination by the casting vote of\r\nJohn C. Calhoun, the Vice-President. In 1832 was elected Vice-President\r\nof the United States, and in 1833 came to preside over the body which\r\na year before had rejected him as a foreign minister. On May 20, 1835,\r\nwas formally nominated for the Presidency, and was elected in 1836 over\r\nhis three competitors, William H. Harrison, Hugh L. White, and Daniel\r\nWebster, by a majority of 57 in the electoral college, but of only\r\n25,000 in the popular vote. On May 5, 1840, was nominated for the\r\nPresidency by the Democratic national convention at Baltimore, Md. At\r\nthe election on November 10 was defeated by William Henry Harrison, who\r\nreceived 234 electoral votes and a popular majority of nearly 140,000.\r\nVan Buren received but 60 votes in the electoral college. Retired to\r\nhis country seat, Lindenwald, in his native county. Was a candidate for\r\nthe Presidential nomination at the Democratic national convention at\r\nBaltimore, Md., May 27, 1844, but was defeated by James K. Polk. Was\r\nnominated for the Presidency by a Barnburner convention at Utica, N.Y.,\r\nJune 22, 1848, a nomination which he had declined by letter in advance.\r\nHe was also nominated for the Presidency by the Free Soil national\r\nconvention of Buffalo, August 9, 1848. At the election, November 7,\r\nreceived only a popular vote of 291,263, and no electoral vote.\r\nSupported Franklin Pierce for the Presidency in 1852 and James Buchanan\r\nin 1856. In 1860 voted the fusion ticket of Breckinridge, Douglas, and\r\nBell in New York against Mr. Lincoln, but when the civil war began gave\r\nto the Administration his zealous support. Died at Kinderhook July 24,\r\n1862, and was buried there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINAUGURAL ADDRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nFellow Citizens: The practice of all my predecessors imposes on me an\r\nobligation I cheerfully fulfill--to accompany the first and solemn act\r\nof my public trust with an avowal of the principles that will guide me\r\nin performing it and an expression of my feelings on assuming a charge\r\nso responsible and vast. In imitating their example I tread in the\r\nfootsteps of illustrious men, whose superiors it is our happiness\r\nto believe are not found on the executive calendar of any country.\r\nAmong them we recognize the earliest and firmest pillars of the\r\nRepublic--those by whom our national independence was first declared,\r\nhim who above all others contributed to establish it on the field of\r\nbattle, and those whose expanded intellect and patriotism constructed,\r\nimproved, and perfected the inestimable institutions under which we\r\nlive. If such men in the position I now occupy felt themselves\r\noverwhelmed by a sense of gratitude for this the highest of all marks of\r\ntheir country's confidence, and by a consciousness of their inability\r\nadequately to discharge the duties of an office so difficult and\r\nexalted, how much more must these considerations affect one who can rely\r\non no such claims for favor or forbearance! Unlike all who have preceded\r\nme, the Revolution that gave us existence as one people was achieved at\r\nthe period of my birth; and whilst I contemplate with grateful reverence\r\nthat memorable event, I feel that I belong to a later age and that I may\r\nnot expect my countrymen to weigh my actions with the same kind and\r\npartial hand.\r\n\r\nSo sensibly, fellow-citizens, do these circumstances press themselves\r\nupon me that I should not dare to enter upon my path of duty did I not\r\nlook for the generous aid of those who will be associated with me in\r\nthe various and coordinate branches of the Government; did I not repose\r\nwith unwavering reliance on the patriotism, the intelligence, and the\r\nkindness of a people who never yet deserted a public servant honestly\r\nlaboring in their cause; and, above all, did I not permit myself humbly\r\nto hope for the sustaining support of an ever-watchful and beneficent\r\nProvidence.\r\n\r\nTo the confidence and consolation derived from these sources it would\r\nbe ungrateful not to add those which spring from our present fortunate\r\ncondition. Though not altogether exempt from embarrassments that\r\ndisturb our tranquillity at home and threaten it abroad, yet in all the\r\nattributes of a great, happy, and flourishing people we stand without\r\na parallel in the world. Abroad we enjoy the respect and, with scarcely\r\nan exception, the friendship of every nation; at home, while our\r\nGovernment quietly but efficiently performs the sole legitimate end\r\nof political institutions--in doing the greatest good to the greatest\r\nnumber--we present an aggregate of human prosperity surely not elsewhere\r\nto be found.\r\n\r\nHow imperious, then, is the obligation imposed upon every citizen, in\r\nhis own sphere of action, whether limited or extended, to exert himself\r\nin perpetuating a condition of things so singularly happy! All the\r\nlessons of history and experience must be lost upon us if we are content\r\nto trust alone to the peculiar advantages we happen to possess. Position\r\nand climate and the bounteous resources that nature has scattered with\r\nso liberal a hand--even the diffused intelligence and elevated character\r\nof our people--will avail us nothing if we fail sacredly to uphold those\r\npolitical institutions that were wisely and deliberately formed with\r\nreference to every circumstance that could preserve or might endanger\r\nthe blessings we enjoy. The thoughtful framers of our Constitution\r\nlegislated for our country as they found it. Looking upon it with the\r\neyes of statesmen and patriots, they saw all the sources of rapid and\r\nwonderful prosperity; but they saw also that various habits, opinions,\r\nand institutions peculiar to the various portions of so vast a region\r\nwere deeply fixed. Distinct sovereignties were in actual existence,\r\nwhose cordial union was essential to the welfare and happiness of\r\nall. Between many of them there was, at least to some extent, a real\r\ndiversity of interests, liable to be exaggerated through sinister\r\ndesigns; they differed in size, in population, in wealth, and in actual\r\nand prospective resources and power; they varied in the character of\r\ntheir industry and staple productions, and [in some] existed domestic\r\ninstitutions which, unwisely disturbed, might endanger the harmony of\r\nthe whole. Most carefully were all these circumstances weighed, and the\r\nfoundations of the new Government laid upon principles of reciprocal\r\nconcession and equitable compromise. The jealousies which the smaller\r\nStates might entertain of the power of the rest were allayed by a rule\r\nof representation confessedly unequal at the time, and designed forever\r\nto remain so. A natural fear that the broad scope of general legislation\r\nmight bear upon and unwisely control particular interests was\r\ncounteracted by limits strictly drawn around the action of the Federal\r\nauthority, and to the people and the States was left unimpaired their\r\nsovereign power over the innumerable subjects embraced in the internal\r\ngovernment of a just republic, excepting such only as necessarily\r\nappertain to the concerns of the whole confederacy or its intercourse\r\nas a united community with the other nations of the world.\r\n\r\nThis provident forecast has been verified by time. Half a century,\r\nteeming with extraordinary events, and elsewhere producing astonishing\r\nresults, has passed along, but on our institutions it has left no\r\ninjurious mark. From a small community we have risen to a people\r\npowerful in numbers and in strength; but with our increase has gone hand\r\nin hand the progress of just principles. The privileges, civil and\r\nreligious, of the humblest individual are still sacredly protected at\r\nhome, and while the valor and fortitude of our people have removed far\r\nfrom us the slightest apprehension of foreign power, they have not yet\r\ninduced us in a single instance to forget what is right. Our commerce\r\nhas been extended to the remotest nations; the value and even nature of\r\nour productions have been greatly changed; a wide difference has arisen\r\nin the relative wealth and resources of every portion of our country;\r\nyet the spirit of mutual regard and of faithful adherence to existing\r\ncompacts has continued to prevail in our councils and never long been\r\nabsent from our conduct. We have learned by experience a fruitful\r\nlesson--that an implicit and undeviating adherence to the principles\r\non which we set out can carry us prosperously onward through all the\r\nconflicts of circumstances and vicissitudes inseparable from the lapse\r\nof years.\r\n\r\nThe success that has thus attended our great experiment is in itself\r\na sufficient cause for gratitude, on account of the happiness it has\r\nactually conferred and the example it has unanswerably given. But to\r\nme, my fellow-citizens, looking forward to the far-distant future with\r\nardent prayers and confiding hopes, this retrospect presents a ground\r\nfor still deeper delight. It impresses on my mind a firm belief that\r\nthe perpetuity of our institutions depends upon ourselves; that if we\r\nmaintain the principles on which they were established they are destined\r\nto confer their benefits on countless generations yet to come, and that\r\nAmerica will present to every friend of mankind the cheering proof\r\nthat a popular government, wisely formed, is wanting in no element of\r\nendurance or strength. Fifty years ago its rapid failure was boldly\r\npredicted. Latent and uncontrollable causes of dissolution were supposed\r\nto exist even by the wise and good, and not only did unfriendly or\r\nspeculative theorists anticipate for us the fate of past republics, but\r\nthe fears of many an honest patriot overbalanced his sanguine hopes.\r\nLook back on these forebodings, not hastily but reluctantly made, and\r\nsee how in every instance they have completely failed.\r\n\r\nAn imperfect experience during the struggles of the Revolution was\r\nsupposed to warrant the belief that the people would not bear the\r\ntaxation requisite to discharge an immense public debt already incurred\r\nand to pay the necessary expenses of the Government. The cost of two\r\nwars has been paid, not only without a murmur, but with unequaled\r\nalacrity. No one is now left to doubt that every burden will be\r\ncheerfully borne that may be necessary to sustain our civil institutions\r\nor guard our honor or welfare. Indeed, all experience has shown that\r\nthe willingness of the people to contribute to these ends in cases of\r\nemergency has uniformly outrun the confidence of their representatives.\r\n\r\nIn the early stages of the new Government, when all felt the imposing\r\ninfluence as they recognized the unequaled services of the first\r\nPresident, it was a common sentiment that the great weight of his\r\ncharacter could alone bind the discordant materials of our Government\r\ntogether and save us from the violence of contending factions. Since his\r\ndeath nearly forty years are gone. Party exasperation has been often\r\ncarried to its highest point; the virtue and fortitude of the people\r\nhave sometimes been greatly tried; yet our system, purified and enhanced\r\nin value by all it has encountered, still preserves its spirit of free\r\nand fearless discussion, blended with unimpaired fraternal feeling.\r\n\r\nThe capacity of the people for self-government, and their\r\nwillingness, from a high sense of duty and without those exhibitions\r\nof coercive power so generally employed in other countries, to submit\r\nto all needful restraints and exactions of municipal law, have also\r\nbeen favorably exemplified in the history of the American States.\r\nOccasionally, it is true, the ardor of public sentiment, outrunning the\r\nregular progress of the judicial tribunals or seeking to reach cases\r\nnot denounced as criminal by the existing law, has displayed itself\r\nin a manner calculated to give pain to the friends of free government\r\nand to encourage the hopes of those who wish for its overthrow. These\r\noccurrences, however, have been far less frequent in our country than\r\nin any other of equal population on the globe, and with the diffusion of\r\nintelligence it may well be hoped that they will constantly diminish in\r\nfrequency and violence. The generous patriotism and sound common sense\r\nof the great mass of our fellow-citizens will assuredly in time produce\r\nthis result; for as every assumption of illegal power not only wounds\r\nthe majesty of the law, but furnishes a pretext for abridging the\r\nliberties of the people, the latter have the most direct and permanent\r\ninterest in preserving the landmarks of social order and maintaining\r\non all occasions the inviolability of those constitutional and legal\r\nprovisions which they themselves have made.\r\n\r\nIn a supposed unfitness of our institutions for those hostile\r\nemergencies which no country can always avoid their friends found a\r\nfruitful source of apprehension, their enemies of hope. While they\r\nforesaw less promptness of action than in governments differently\r\nformed, they overlooked the far more important consideration that with\r\nus war could never be the result of individual or irresponsible will,\r\nbut must be a measure of redress for injuries sustained, voluntarily\r\nresorted to by those who were to bear the necessary sacrifice, who would\r\nconsequently feel an individual interest in the contest, and whose\r\nenergy would be commensurate with the difficulties to be encountered.\r\nActual events have proved their error; the last war, far from impairing,\r\ngave new confidence to our Government, and amid recent apprehensions of\r\na similar conflict we saw that the energies of our country would not be\r\nwanting in ample season to vindicate its rights. We may not possess, as\r\nwe should not desire to possess, the extended and ever-ready military\r\norganization of other nations; we may occasionally suffer in the outset\r\nfor the want of it; but among ourselves all doubt upon this great point\r\nhas ceased, while a salutary experience will prevent a contrary opinion\r\nfrom inviting aggression from abroad.\r\n\r\nCertain danger was foretold from the extension of our territory, the\r\nmultiplication of States, and the increase of population. Our system\r\nwas supposed to be adapted only to boundaries comparatively narrow.\r\nThese have been widened beyond conjecture; the members of our\r\nConfederacy are already doubled, and the numbers of our people are\r\nincredibly augmented. The alleged causes of danger have long surpassed\r\nanticipation, but none of the consequences have followed. The power and\r\ninfluence of the Republic have risen to a height obvious to all mankind;\r\nrespect for its authority was not more apparent at its ancient than\r\nit is at its present limits; new and inexhaustible sources of general\r\nprosperity have been opened; the effects of distance have been averted\r\nby the inventive genius of our people, developed and fostered by the\r\nspirit of our institutions; and the enlarged variety and amount of\r\ninterests, productions, and pursuits have strengthened the chain of\r\nmutual dependence and formed a circle of mutual benefits too apparent\r\never to be overlooked.\r\n\r\nIn justly balancing the powers of the Federal and State authorities\r\ndifficulties nearly insurmountable arose at the outset, and subsequent\r\ncollisions were deemed inevitable. Amid these it was scarcely believed\r\npossible that a scheme of government so complex in construction could\r\nremain uninjured. From time to time embarrassments have certainly\r\noccurred; but how just is the confidence of future safety imparted\r\nby the knowledge that each in succession has been happily removed!\r\nOverlooking partial and temporary evils as inseparable from the\r\npractical operation of all human institutions, and looking only to the\r\ngeneral result, every patriot has reason to be satisfied. While the\r\nFederal Government has successfully performed its appropriate functions\r\nin relation to foreign affairs and concerns evidently national, that of\r\nevery State has remarkably improved in protecting and developing local\r\ninterests and individual welfare; and if the vibrations of authority\r\nhave occasionally tended too much toward one or the other, it is\r\nunquestionably certain that the ultimate operation of the entire system\r\nhas been to strengthen all the existing institutions and to elevate our\r\nwhole country in prosperity and renown.\r\n\r\nThe last, perhaps the greatest, of the prominent sources of discord and\r\ndisaster supposed to lurk in our political condition was the institution\r\nof domestic slavery. Our forefathers were deeply impressed with the\r\ndelicacy of this subject, and they treated it with a forbearance so\r\nevidently wise that in spite of every sinister foreboding it never until\r\nthe present period disturbed the tranquillity of our common country.\r\nSuch a result is sufficient evidence of the justice and the patriotism\r\nof their course; it is evidence not to be mistaken that an adherence to\r\nit can prevent all embarrassment from this as well as from every other\r\nanticipated cause of difficulty or danger. Have not recent events made\r\nit obvious to the slightest reflection that the least deviation from\r\nthis spirit of forbearance is injurious to every interest, that of\r\nhumanity included? Amidst the violence of excited passions this generous\r\nand fraternal feeling has been sometimes disregarded; and standing as\r\nI now do before my countrymen, in this high place of honor and of trust,\r\nI can not refrain from anxiously invoking my fellow-citizens never to\r\nbe deaf to its dictates. Perceiving before my election the deep interest\r\nthis subject was beginning to excite, I believed it a solemn duty fully\r\nto make known my sentiments in regard to it, and now, when every motive\r\nfor misrepresentation has passed away, I trust that they will be\r\ncandidly weighed and understood. At least they will be my standard of\r\nconduct in the path before me. I then declared that if the desire of\r\nthose of my countrymen who were favorable to my election was gratified\r\n\"I must go into the Presidential chair the inflexible and uncompromising\r\nopponent of every attempt on the part of Congress to abolish slavery in\r\nthe District of Columbia against the wishes of the slaveholding States,\r\nand also with a determination equally decided to resist the slightest\r\ninterference with it in the States where it exists.\" I submitted also to\r\nmy fellow-citizens, with fullness and frankness, the reasons which led\r\nme to this determination. The result authorizes me to believe that they\r\nhave been approved and are confided in by a majority of the people of\r\nthe United States, including those whom they most immediately affect.\r\nIt now only remains to add that no bill conflicting with these views\r\ncan ever receive my constitutional sanction. These opinions have been\r\nadopted in the firm belief that they are in accordance with the spirit\r\nthat actuated the venerated fathers of the Republic, and that succeeding\r\nexperience has proved them to be humane, patriotic, expedient,\r\nhonorable, and just. If the agitation of this subject was intended to\r\nreach the stability of our institutions, enough has occurred to show\r\nthat it has signally failed, and that in this as in every other instance\r\nthe apprehensions of the timid and the hopes of the wicked for the\r\ndestruction of our Government are again destined to be disappointed.\r\nHere and there, indeed, scenes of dangerous excitement have occurred,\r\nterrifying instances of local violence have been witnessed, and a\r\nreckless disregard of the consequences of their conduct has exposed\r\nindividuals to popular indignation; but neither masses of the people nor\r\nsections of the country have been swerved from their devotion to the\r\nbond of union and the principles it has made sacred. It will be ever\r\nthus. Such attempts at dangerous agitation may periodically return,\r\nbut with each the object will be better understood. That predominating\r\naffection for our political system which prevails throughout our\r\nterritorial limits, that calm and enlightened judgment which ultimately\r\ngoverns our people as one vast body, will always be at hand to resist\r\nand control every effort, foreign or domestic, which aims or would lead\r\nto overthrow our institutions.\r\n\r\nWhat can be more gratifying than such a retrospect as this? We look back\r\non obstacles avoided and dangers overcome, on expectations more than\r\nrealized and prosperity perfectly secured. To the hopes of the hostile,\r\nthe fears of the timid, and the doubts of the anxious actual experience\r\nhas given the conclusive reply. We have seen time gradually dispel every\r\nunfavorable foreboding and our Constitution surmount every adverse\r\ncircumstance dreaded at the outset as beyond control. Present excitement\r\nwill at all times magnify present dangers, but true philosophy must\r\nteach us that none more threatening than the past can remain to be\r\novercome; and we ought (for we have just reason) to entertain an abiding\r\nconfidence in the stability of our institutions and an entire conviction\r\nthat if administered in the true form, character, and spirit in which\r\nthey were established they are abundantly adequate to preserve to us and\r\nour children the rich blessings already derived from them, to make our\r\nbeloved land for a thousand generations that chosen spot where happiness\r\nsprings from a perfect equality of political rights.\r\n\r\nFor myself, therefore, I desire to declare that the principle that\r\nwill govern me in the high duty to which my country calls me is a\r\nstrict adherence to the letter and spirit of the Constitution as it\r\nwas designed by those who framed it. Looking back to it as a sacred\r\ninstrument carefully and not easily framed; remembering that it was\r\nthroughout a work of concession and compromise; viewing it as limited\r\nto national objects; regarding it as leaving to the people and the\r\nStates all power not explicitly parted with, I shall endeavor to\r\npreserve, protect, and defend it by anxiously referring to its provision\r\nfor direction in every action. To matters of domestic concernment which\r\nit has intrusted to the Federal Government and to such as relate to our\r\nintercourse with foreign nations I shall zealously devote myself; beyond\r\nthose limits I shall never pass.\r\n\r\nTo enter on this occasion into a further or more minute exposition of my\r\nviews on the various questions of domestic policy would be as obtrusive\r\nas it is probably unexpected. Before the suffrages of my countrymen were\r\nconferred upon me I submitted to them, with great precision, my opinions\r\non all the most prominent of these subjects. Those opinions I shall\r\nendeavor to carry out with my utmost ability.\r\n\r\nOur course of foreign policy has been so uniform and intelligible as\r\nto constitute a rule of Executive conduct which leaves little to my\r\ndiscretion, unless, indeed, I were willing to run counter to the lights\r\nof experience and the known opinions of my constituents. We sedulously\r\ncultivate the friendship of all nations as the condition most compatible\r\nwith our welfare and the principles of our Government. We decline\r\nalliances as adverse to our peace. We desire commercial relations on\r\nequal terms, being ever willing to give a fair equivalent for advantages\r\nreceived We endeavor to conduct our intercourse with openness and\r\nsincerity, promptly avowing our objects and seeking to establish that\r\nmutual frankness which is as beneficial in the dealings of nations as\r\nof men. We have no disposition and we disclaim all right to meddle in\r\ndisputes, whether internal or foreign, that may molest other countries,\r\nregarding them in their actual state as social communities, and\r\npreserving a strict neutrality in all their controversies. Well knowing\r\nthe tried valor of our people and our exhaustless resources, we neither\r\nanticipate nor fear any designed aggression; and in the consciousness of\r\nour own just conduct we feel a security that we shall never be called\r\nupon to exert our determination never to permit an invasion of our\r\nrights without punishment or redress.\r\n\r\nIn approaching, then, in the presence of my assembled countrymen, to\r\nmake the solemn promise that yet remains, and to pledge myself that\r\nI will faithfully execute the office I am about to fill, I bring with\r\nme a settled purpose to maintain the institutions of my country, which\r\nI trust will atone for the errors I commit.\r\n\r\nIn receiving from the people the sacred trust twice confided to my\r\nillustrious predecessor, and which he has discharged so faithfully and\r\nso well, I know that I can not expect to perform the arduous task with\r\nequal ability and success. But united as I have been in his counsels, a\r\ndaily witness of his exclusive and unsurpassed devotion to his country's\r\nwelfare, agreeing with him in sentiments which his countrymen have\r\nwarmly supported, and permitted to partake largely of his confidence,\r\nI may hope that somewhat of the same cheering approbation will be found\r\nto attend upon my path. For him I but express with my own the wishes of\r\nall, that he may yet long live to enjoy the brilliant evening of his\r\nwell-spent life; and for myself, conscious of but one desire, faithfully\r\nto serve my country, I throw myself without fear on its justice and its\r\nkindness. Beyond that I only look to the gracious protection of the\r\nDivine Being whose strengthening support I humbly solicit, and whom\r\nI fervently pray to look down upon us all.

The Major-General Commanding in Chief has received from the War\r\nDepartment the following order:\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 6, 1837_.\r\n\r\nGeneral Andrew Jackson, ex-President of the United States, being about\r\nto depart from this city for his home in Tennessee, and the state of his\r\nhealth rendering it important that he should be accompanied by a medical\r\nattendant, the President directs that the Surgeon-General of the Army\r\naccompany the ex-President to Wheeling, in the State of Virginia, there\r\nto be relieved, in case the ex-President's health shall be such as to\r\nallow it, by some officer of the Medical Department, who will attend\r\nthe ex-President from that place to his residence.\r\n\r\nIn giving this order the President feels assured that this mark of\r\nattention to the venerable soldier, patriot, and statesman now retiring\r\nin infirm health from the cares of office to the repose of private life\r\nwill be as grateful to the feelings of the American people as it appears\r\nto the President to be suitable in itself.\r\n\r\nM.

Pursuant to the above order, Surgeon-General Lawson will immediately\r\njoin the ex-President, and will accompany him as his medical attendant\r\nto Wheeling, in the State of Virginia, and, at his discretion, to the\r\nresidence of the ex-President, at the Hermitage, near Nashville, in the\r\nState of Tennessee.\r\n\r\nIII. Assistant Surgeon Reynolds will join the ex-President at Wheeling,\r\nVa., and from that place, either alone or in conjunction with the\r\nSurgeon-General, as the latter may direct, will proceed with the\r\nex-President to his residence in Tennessee.\r\n\r\nIV. The officers above named, on the conclusion of the duties above\r\nassigned to them, will repair to their respective stations.\r\n\r\nBy order of Alexander Macomb, Major-General Commanding in Chief:\r\n\r\nR. JONES,\r\n\r\n_Adjutant-General_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL SESSION MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _September 4, 1837_.\r\n\r\n_Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe act of the 23d of June, 1836, regulating the deposits of the public\r\nmoney and directing the employment of State, District, and Territorial\r\nbanks for that purpose, made it the duty of the Secretary of the Treasury\r\nto discontinue the use of such of them as should at any time refuse to\r\nredeem their notes in specie, and to substitute other banks, provided a\r\nsufficient number could be obtained to receive the public deposits upon\r\nthe terms and conditions therein prescribed. The general and almost\r\nsimultaneous suspension of specie payments by the banks in May last\r\nrendered the performance of this duty imperative in respect to those\r\nwhich had been selected under the act, and made it at the same time\r\nimpracticable to employ the requisite number of others upon the\r\nprescribed conditions. The specific regulations established by Congress\r\nfor the deposit and safe-keeping of the public moneys having thus\r\nunexpectedly become inoperative, I felt it to be my duty to afford you\r\nan early opportunity for the exercise of your supervisory powers over\r\nthe subject.\r\n\r\nI was also led to apprehend that the suspension of specie payments,\r\nincreasing the embarrassments before existing in the pecuniary affairs\r\nof the country, would so far diminish the public revenue that the\r\naccruing receipts into the Treasury would not, with the reserved five\r\nmillions, be sufficient to defray the unavoidable expenses of the\r\nGovernment until the usual period for the meeting of Congress, whilst\r\nthe authority to call upon the States for a portion of the sums\r\ndeposited with them was too restricted to enable the Department to\r\nrealize a sufficient amount from that source. These apprehensions have\r\nbeen justified by subsequent results, which render it certain that this\r\ndeficiency will occur if additional means be not provided by Congress.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties experienced by the mercantile interest in meeting\r\ntheir engagements induced them to apply to me previously to the actual\r\nsuspension of specie payments for indulgence upon their bonds for\r\nduties, and all the relief authorized by law was promptly and cheerfully\r\ngranted. The dependence of the Treasury upon the avails of these bonds\r\nto enable it to make the deposits with the States required by law led me\r\nin the outset to limit this indulgence to the 1st of September, but it\r\nhas since been extended to the 1st of October, that the matter might be\r\nsubmitted to your further direction.\r\n\r\nQuestions were also expected to arise in the recess in respect to the\r\nOctober installment of those deposits requiring the interposition of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nA provision of another act, passed about the same time, and intended to\r\nsecure a faithful compliance with the obligation of the United States to\r\nsatisfy all demands upon them in specie or its equivalent, prohibited\r\nthe offer of any bank note not convertible on the spot into gold or\r\nsilver at the will of the holder; and the ability of the Government,\r\nwith millions on deposit, to meet its engagements in the manner thus\r\nrequired by law was rendered very doubtful by the event to which I have\r\nreferred.\r\n\r\nSensible that adequate provisions for these unexpected exigencies\r\ncould only be made by Congress; convinced that some of them would be\r\nindispensably necessary to the public service before the regular period\r\nof your meeting, and desirous also to enable you to exercise at the\r\nearliest moment your full constitutional powers for the relief of\r\nthe country, I could not with propriety avoid subjecting you to the\r\ninconvenience of assembling at as early a day as the state of the\r\npopular representation would permit. I am sure that I have done but\r\njustice to your feelings in believing that this inconvenience will be\r\ncheerfully encountered in the hope of rendering your meeting conducive\r\nto the good of the country.\r\n\r\nDuring the earlier stages of the revulsion through which we have just\r\npassed much acrimonious discussion arose and great diversity of opinion\r\nexisted as to its real causes. This was not surprising. The operations\r\nof credit are so diversified and the influences which affect them so\r\nnumerous, and often so subtle, that even impartial and well-informed\r\npersons are seldom found to agree in respect to them. To inherent\r\ndifficulties were also added other tendencies which were by no means\r\nfavorable to the discovery of truth. It was hardly to be expected that\r\nthose who disapproved the policy of the Government in relation to the\r\ncurrency would, in the excited state of public feeling produced by the\r\noccasion, fail to attribute to that policy any extensive embarrassment\r\nin the monetary affairs of the country. The matter thus became connected\r\nwith the passions and conflicts of party; opinions were more or less\r\naffected by political considerations, and differences were prolonged\r\nwhich might otherwise have been determined by an appeal to facts, by the\r\nexercise of reason, or by mutual concession. It is, however, a cheering\r\nreflection that circumstances of this nature can not prevent a community\r\nso intelligent as ours from ultimately arriving at correct conclusions.\r\nEncouraged by the firm belief of this truth, I proceed to state my\r\nviews, so far as may be necessary to a clear understanding of the\r\nremedies I feel it my duty to propose and of the reasons by which I have\r\nbeen led to recommend them.\r\n\r\nThe history of trade in the United States for the last three or four\r\nyears affords the most convincing evidence that our present condition\r\nis chiefly to be attributed to overaction in all the departments of\r\nbusiness--an over-action deriving, perhaps, its first impulses from\r\nantecedent causes, but stimulated to its destructive consequences\r\nby excessive issues of bank paper and by other facilities for the\r\nacquisition and enlargement of credit. At the commencement of the year\r\n1834 the banking capital of the United States, including that of the\r\nnational bank, then existing, amounted to about $200,000,000, the bank\r\nnotes then in circulation to about ninety-five millions, and the loans\r\nand discounts of the banks to three hundred and twenty-four millions.\r\nBetween that time and the 1st of January, 1836, being the latest period\r\nto which accurate accounts have been received, our banking capital was\r\nincreased to more than two hundred and fifty-one millions, our paper\r\ncirculation to more than one hundred and forty millions, and the loans\r\nand discounts to more than four hundred and fifty-seven millions.\r\nTo this vast increase are to be added the many millions of credit\r\nacquired by means of foreign loans, contracted by the States and State\r\ninstitutions, and, above all, by the lavish accommodations extended\r\nby foreign dealers to our merchants.\r\n\r\nThe consequences of this redundancy of credit and of the spirit of\r\nreckless speculation engendered by it were a foreign debt contracted\r\nby our citizens estimated in March last at more than $30,000,000; the\r\nextension to traders in the interior of our country of credits for\r\nsupplies greatly beyond the wants of the people; the investment of\r\n$39,500,000 in unproductive public lands in the years 1835 and 1836,\r\nwhilst in the preceding year the sales amounted to only four and a\r\nhalf millions; the creation of debts, to an almost countless amount,\r\nfor real estate in existing or anticipated cities and villages,\r\nequally unproductive, and at prices now seen to have been greatly\r\ndisproportionate to their real value; the expenditure of immense sums\r\nin improvements which in many cases have been found to be ruinously\r\nimprovident; the diversion to other pursuits of much of the labor that\r\nshould have been applied to agriculture, thereby contributing to the\r\nexpenditure of large sums in the importation of grain from Europe--an\r\nexpenditure which, amounting in 1834 to about $250,000, was in the first\r\ntwo quarters of the present year increased to more than $2,000,000; and\r\nfinally, without enumerating other injurious results, the rapid growth\r\namong all classes, and especially in our great commercial towns, of\r\nluxurious habits founded too often on merely fancied wealth, and\r\ndetrimental alike to the industry, the resources, and the morals of\r\nour people.\r\n\r\nIt was so impossible that such a state of things could long continue\r\nthat the prospect of revulsion was present to the minds of considerate\r\nmen before it actually came. None, however, had correctly anticipated\r\nits severity. A concurrence of circumstances inadequate of themselves to\r\nproduce such widespread and calamitous embarrassments tended so greatly\r\nto aggravate them that they can not be overlooked in considering their\r\nhistory. Among these may be mentioned, as most prominent, the great loss\r\nof capital sustained by our commercial emporium in the fire of December,\r\n1835--a loss the effects of which were underrated at the time because\r\npostponed for a season by the great facilities of credit then existing;\r\nthe disturbing effects in our commercial cities of the transfers of\r\nthe public moneys required by the deposit law of June, 1836, and the\r\nmeasures adopted by the foreign creditors of our merchants to reduce\r\ntheir debts and to withdraw from the United States a large portion of\r\nour specie.\r\n\r\nHowever unwilling any of our citizens may heretofore have been to assign\r\nto these causes the chief instrumentality in producing the present state\r\nof things, the developments subsequently made and the actual condition\r\nof other commercial countries must, as it seems to me, dispel all\r\nremaining doubts upon the subject. It has since appeared that evils\r\nsimilar to those suffered by ourselves have been experienced in Great\r\nBritain, on the Continent, and, indeed, throughout the commercial world,\r\nand that in other countries as well as in our own they have been\r\nuniformly preceded by an undue enlargement of the boundaries of trade,\r\nprompted, as with us, by unprecedented expansions of the systems of\r\ncredit. A reference to the amount of banking capital and the issues of\r\npaper credits put in circulation in Great Britain, by banks and in other\r\nways, during the years 1834, 1835, and 1836 will show an augmentation\r\nof the paper currency there as much disproportioned to the real wants\r\nof trade as in the United States. With this redundancy of the paper\r\ncurrency there arose in that country also a spirit of adventurous\r\nspeculation embracing the whole range of human enterprise. Aid was\r\nprofusely given to projected improvements; large investments were\r\nmade in foreign stocks and loans; credits for goods were granted with\r\nunbounded liberality to merchants in foreign countries, and all the\r\nmeans of acquiring and employing credit were put in active operation and\r\nextended in their effects to every department of business and to every\r\nquarter of the globe. The reaction was proportioned in its violence\r\nto the extraordinary character of the events which preceded it. The\r\ncommercial community of Great Britain were subjected to the greatest\r\ndifficulties, and their debtors in this country were not only suddenly\r\ndeprived of accustomed and expected credits, but called upon for\r\npayments which in the actual posture of things here could only be made\r\nthrough a general pressure and at the most ruinous sacrifices.\r\n\r\nIn view of these facts it would seem impossible for sincere inquirers\r\nafter truth to resist the conviction that the causes of the revulsion\r\nin both countries have been substantially the same. Two nations, the\r\nmost commercial in the world, enjoying but recently the highest degree\r\nof apparent prosperity and maintaining with each other the closest\r\nrelations, are suddenly, in a time of profound peace and without any\r\ngreat national disaster, arrested in their career and plunged into a\r\nstate of embarrassment and distress. In both countries we have witnessed\r\nthe same redundancy of paper money and other facilities of credit;\r\nthe same spirit of speculation; the same partial successes; the same\r\ndifficulties and reverses, and at length nearly the same overwhelming\r\ncatastrophe. The most material difference between the results in the\r\ntwo countries has only been that with us there has also occurred an\r\nextensive derangement in the fiscal affairs of the Federal and State\r\nGovernments, occasioned by the suspension of specie payments by the\r\nbanks.\r\n\r\nThe history of these causes and effects in Great Britain and the United\r\nStates is substantially the history of the revulsion in all other\r\ncommercial countries.\r\n\r\nThe present and visible effects of these circumstances on the operations\r\nof the Government and on the industry of the people point out the\r\nobjects which call for your immediate attention.\r\n\r\nThey are, to regulate by law the safe-keeping, transfer, and\r\ndisbursement of the public moneys; to designate the funds to be received\r\nand paid by the Government; to enable the Treasury to meet promptly\r\nevery demand upon it; to prescribe the terms of indulgence and the mode\r\nof settlement to be adopted, as well in collecting from individuals the\r\nrevenue that has accrued as in withdrawing it from former depositories;\r\nand to devise and adopt such further measures, within the constitutional\r\ncompetency of Congress, as will be best calculated to revive the\r\nenterprise and to promote the prosperity of the country.\r\n\r\nFor the deposit, transfer, and disbursement of the revenue national and\r\nState banks have always, with temporary and limited exceptions, been\r\nheretofore employed; but although advocates of each system are still to\r\nbe found, it is apparent that the events of the last few months have\r\ngreatly augmented the desire, long existing among the people of the\r\nUnited States, to separate the fiscal operations of the Government from\r\nthose of individuals or corporations.\r\n\r\nAgain to create a national bank as a fiscal agent would be to\r\ndisregard the popular will, twice solemnly and unequivocally expressed.\r\nOn no question of domestic policy is there stronger evidence that the\r\nsentiments of a large majority are deliberately fixed, and I can not\r\nconcur with those who think they see in recent events a proof that these\r\nsentiments are, or a reason that they should be, changed.\r\n\r\nEvents similar in their origin and character have heretofore frequently\r\noccurred without producing any such change, and the lessons of\r\nexperience must be forgotten if we suppose that the present overthrow of\r\ncredit would have been prevented by the existence of a national bank.\r\nProneness to excessive issues has ever been the vice of the banking\r\nsystem--a vice as prominent in national as in State institutions. This\r\npropensity is as subservient to the advancement of private interests\r\nin the one as in the other, and those who direct them both, being\r\nprincipally guided by the same views and influenced by the same motives,\r\nwill be equally ready to stimulate extravagance of enterprise by\r\nimprovidence of credit. How strikingly is this conclusion sustained\r\nby experience! The Bank of the United States, with the vast powers\r\nconferred on it by Congress, did not or could not prevent former and\r\nsimilar embarrassments, nor has the still greater strength it has been\r\nsaid to possess under its present charter enabled it in the existing\r\nemergency to check other institutions or even to save itself. In Great\r\nBritain, where it has been seen the same causes have been attended with\r\nthe same effects, a national bank possessing powers far greater than are\r\nasked for by the warmest advocates of such an institution here has also\r\nproved unable to prevent an undue expansion of credit and the evils that\r\nflow from it. Nor can I find any tenable ground for the reestablishment\r\nof a national bank in the derangement alleged at present to exist in the\r\ndomestic exchanges of the country or in the facilities it may be capable\r\nof affording them. Although advantages of this sort were anticipated\r\nwhen the first Bank of the United States was created, they were regarded\r\nas an incidental accommodation, not one which the Federal Government was\r\nbound or could be called upon to furnish. This accommodation is now,\r\nindeed, after the lapse of not many years, demanded from it as among its\r\nfirst duties, and an omission to aid and regulate commercial exchange\r\nis treated as a ground of loud and serious complaint. Such results only\r\nserve to exemplify the constant desire among some of our citizens to\r\nenlarge the powers of the Government and extend its control to subjects\r\nwith which it should not interfere. They can never justify the creation\r\nof an institution to promote such objects. On the contrary, they justly\r\nexcite among the community a more diligent inquiry into the character\r\nof those operations of trade toward which it is desired to extend such\r\npeculiar favors.\r\n\r\nThe various transactions which bear the name of domestic exchanges\r\ndiffer essentially in their nature, operation, and utility. One class of\r\nthem consists of bills of exchange drawn for the purpose of transferring\r\nactual capital from one part of the country to another, or to anticipate\r\nthe proceeds of property actually transmitted. Bills of this description\r\nare highly useful in the movements of trade and well deserve all the\r\nencouragement which can rightfully be given to them. Another class is\r\nmade up of bills of exchange not drawn to transfer actual capital nor\r\non the credit of property transmitted, but to create fictitious capital,\r\npartaking at once of the character of notes discounted in bank and of\r\nbank notes in circulation, and swelling the mass of paper credits to a\r\nvast extent in the most objectionable manner. These bills have formed\r\nfor the last few years a large proportion of what are termed the\r\ndomestic exchanges of the country, serving as the means of usurious\r\nprofit and constituting the most unsafe and precarious paper in\r\ncirculation. This species of traffic, instead of being upheld, ought\r\nto be discountenanced by the Government and the people.\r\n\r\nIn transferring its funds from place to place the Government is on the\r\nsame footing with the private citizen and may resort to the same legal\r\nmeans. It may do so through the medium of bills drawn by itself or\r\npurchased from others; and in these operations it may, in a manner\r\nundoubtedly constitutional and legitimate, facilitate and assist\r\nexchanges of individuals founded on real transactions of trade. The\r\nextent to which this may be done and the best means of effecting it\r\nare entitled to the fullest consideration. This has been bestowed by\r\nthe Secretary of the Treasury, and his views will be submitted to you\r\nin his report.\r\n\r\nBut it was not designed by the Constitution that the Government should\r\nassume the management of domestic or foreign exchange. It is indeed\r\nauthorized to regulate by law the commerce between the States and to\r\nprovide a general standard of value or medium of exchange in gold and\r\nsilver, but it is not its province to aid individuals in the transfer\r\nof their funds otherwise than through the facilities afforded by the\r\nPost-Office Department. As justly might it be called on to provide for\r\nthe transportation of their merchandise. These are operations of trade.\r\nThey ought to be conducted by those who are interested in them in the\r\nsame manner that the incidental difficulties of other pursuits are\r\nencountered by other classes of citizens. Such aid has not been deemed\r\nnecessary in other countries. Throughout Europe the domestic as well as\r\nthe foreign exchanges are carried on by private houses, often, if not\r\ngenerally, without the assistance of banks; yet they extend throughout\r\ndistinct sovereignties, and far exceed in amount the real exchanges of\r\nthe United States. There is no reason why our own may not be conducted\r\nin the same manner with equal cheapness and safety. Certainly this might\r\nbe accomplished if it were favored by those most deeply interested; and\r\nfew can doubt that their own interest, as well as the general welfare of\r\nthe country, would be promoted by leaving such a subject in the hands of\r\nthose to whom it properly belongs. A system founded on private interest,\r\nenterprise, and competition, without the aid of legislative grants or\r\nregulations by law, would rapidly prosper; it would be free from the\r\ninfluence of political agitation and extend the same exemption to\r\ntrade itself, and it would put an end to those complaints of neglect,\r\npartiality, injustice, and oppression which are the unavoidable\r\nresults of interference by the Government in the proper concerns of\r\nindividuals. All former attempts on the part of the Government to carry\r\nits legislation in this respect further than was designed by the\r\nConstitution have in the end proved injurious, and have served only\r\nto convince the great body of the people more and more of the certain\r\ndangers of blending private interests with the operations of public\r\nbusiness; and there is no reason to suppose that a repetition of them\r\nnow would be more successful.\r\n\r\nIt can not be concealed that there exists in our community opinions and\r\nfeelings on this subject in direct opposition to each other. A large\r\nportion of them, combining great intelligence, activity, and influence,\r\nare no doubt sincere in their belief that the operations of trade ought\r\nto be assisted by such a connection; they regard a national bank as\r\nnecessary for this purpose, and they are disinclined to every measure\r\nthat does not tend sooner or later to the establishment of such an\r\ninstitution. On the other hand, a majority of the people are believed\r\nto be irreconcilably opposed to that measure; they consider such a\r\nconcentration of power dangerous to their liberties, and many of them\r\nregard it as a violation of the Constitution. This collision of opinion\r\nhas doubtless caused much of the embarrassment to which the commercial\r\ntransactions of the country have lately been exposed. Banking has become\r\na political topic of the highest interest, and trade has suffered in\r\nthe conflict of parties. A speedy termination of this state of things,\r\nhowever desirable, is scarcely to be expected. We have seen for nearly\r\nhalf a century that those who advocate a national bank, by whatever\r\nmotive they may be influenced, constitute a portion of our community too\r\nnumerous to allow us to hope for an early abandonment of their favorite\r\nplan. On the other hand, they must indeed form an erroneous estimate\r\nof the intelligence and temper of the American people who suppose that\r\nthey have continued on slight or insufficient grounds their persevering\r\nopposition to such an institution, or that they can be induced by\r\npecuniary pressure or by any other combination of circumstances to\r\nsurrender principles they have so long and so inflexibly maintained.\r\n\r\nMy own views of the subject are unchanged. They have been repeatedly and\r\nunreservedly announced to my fellow-citizens, who with full knowledge\r\nof them conferred upon me the two highest offices of the Government.\r\nOn the last of these occasions I felt it due to the people to apprise\r\nthem distinctly that in the event of my election I would not be able to\r\ncooperate in the reestablishment of a national bank. To these sentiments\r\nI have now only to add the expression of an increased conviction that\r\nthe reestablishment of such a bank in any form, whilst it would not\r\naccomplish the beneficial purpose promised by its advocates, would\r\nimpair the rightful supremacy of the popular will, injure the character\r\nand diminish the influence of our political system, and bring once more\r\ninto existence a concentrated moneyed power, hostile to the spirit and\r\nthreatening the permanency of our republican institutions.\r\n\r\nLocal banks have been employed for the deposit and distribution of\r\nthe revenue at all times partially and on three different occasions\r\nexclusively: First, anterior to the establishment of the first Bank of\r\nthe United States; secondly, in the interval between the termination of\r\nthat institution and the charter of its successor; and thirdly, during\r\nthe limited period which has now so abruptly closed. The connection thus\r\nrepeatedly attempted proved unsatisfactory on each successive occasion,\r\nnotwithstanding the various measures which were adopted to facilitate\r\nor insure its success. On the last occasion, in the year 1833, the\r\nemployment of the State banks was guarded especially, in every way which\r\nexperience and caution could suggest. Personal security was required for\r\nthe safe-keeping and prompt payment of the moneys to be received, and\r\nfull returns of their condition were from time to time to be made by the\r\ndepositories. In the first stages the measure was eminently successful,\r\nnotwithstanding the violent opposition of the Bank of the United States\r\nand the unceasing efforts made to overthrow it. The selected banks\r\nperformed with fidelity and without any embarrassment to themselves or\r\nto the community their engagements to the Government, and the system\r\npromised to be permanently useful; but when it became necessary, under\r\nthe act of June, 1836, to withdraw from them the public money for the\r\npurpose of placing it in additional institutions or of transferring it\r\nto the States, they found it in many cases inconvenient to comply with\r\nthe demands of the Treasury, and numerous and pressing applications were\r\nmade for indulgence or relief. As the installments under the deposit law\r\nbecame payable their own embarrassments and the necessity under which\r\nthey lay of curtailing their discounts and calling in their debts\r\nincreased the general distress and contributed, with other causes, to\r\nhasten the revulsion in which at length they, in common with the other\r\nbanks, were fatally involved.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances it becomes our solemn duty to inquire whether\r\nthere are not in any connection between the Government and banks of\r\nissue evils of great magnitude, inherent in its very nature and against\r\nwhich no precautions can effectually guard.\r\n\r\nUnforeseen in the organization of the Government and forced on the\r\nTreasury by early necessities, the practice of employing banks was in\r\ntruth from the beginning more a measure of emergency than of sound\r\npolicy. When we started into existence as a nation, in addition to the\r\nburdens of the new Government we assumed all the large but honorable\r\nload of debt which was the price of our liberty; but we hesitated to\r\nweigh down the infant industry of the country by resorting to adequate\r\ntaxation for the necessary revenue. The facilities of banks, in return\r\nfor the privileges they acquired, were promptly offered, and perhaps too\r\nreadily received by an embarrassed Treasury. During the long continuance\r\nof a national debt and the intervening difficulties of a foreign war the\r\nconnection was continued from motives of convenience; but these causes\r\nhave long since passed away. We have no emergencies that make banks\r\nnecessary to aid the wants of the Treasury; we have no load of national\r\ndebt to provide for, and we have on actual deposit a large surplus. No\r\npublic interest, therefore, now requires the renewal of a connection\r\nthat circumstances have dissolved. The complete organization of our\r\nGovernment, the abundance of our resources, the general harmony which\r\nprevails between the different States and with foreign powers, all\r\nenable us now to select the system most consistent with the Constitution\r\nand most conducive to the public welfare. Should we, then, connect the\r\nTreasury for a fourth time with the local banks, it can only be under a\r\nconviction that past failures have arisen from accidental, not inherent,\r\ndefects.\r\n\r\nA danger difficult, if not impossible, to be avoided in such an\r\narrangement is made strikingly evident in the very event by which it has\r\nnow been defeated. A sudden act of the banks intrusted with the funds\r\nof the people deprives the Treasury, without fault or agency of the\r\nGovernment, of the ability to pay its creditors in the currency they\r\nhave by law a right to demand. This circumstance no fluctuation of\r\ncommerce could have produced if the public revenue had been collected\r\nin the legal currency and kept in that form by the officers of the\r\nTreasury. The citizen whose money was in bank receives it back since\r\nthe suspension at a sacrifice in its amount, whilst he who kept it in\r\nthe legal currency of the country and in his own possession pursues\r\nwithout loss the current of his business. The Government, placed in the\r\nsituation of the former, is involved in embarrassments it could not have\r\nsuffered had it pursued the course of the latter. These embarrassments\r\nare, moreover, augmented by those salutary and just laws which forbid it\r\nto use a depreciated currency, and by so doing take from the Government\r\nthe ability which individuals have of accommodating their transactions\r\nto such a catastrophe.\r\n\r\nA system which can in a time of profound peace, when there is a large\r\nrevenue laid by, thus suddenly prevent the application and the use of\r\nthe money of the people in the manner and for the objects they have\r\ndirected can not be wise; but who can think without painful reflection\r\nthat under it the same unforeseen events might have befallen us in the\r\nmidst of a war and taken from us at the moment when most wanted the use\r\nof those very means which were treasured up to promote the national\r\nwelfare and guard our national rights? To such embarrassments and to\r\nsuch dangers will this Government be always exposed whilst it takes the\r\nmoneys raised for and necessary to the public service out of the hands\r\nof its own officers and converts them into a mere right of action\r\nagainst corporations intrusted with the possession of them. Nor can\r\nsuch results be effectually guarded against in such a system without\r\ninvesting the Executive with a control over the banks themselves,\r\nwhether State or national, that might with reason be objected to. Ours\r\nis probably the only Government in the world that is liable in the\r\nmanagement of its fiscal concerns to occurrences like these.\r\n\r\nBut this imminent risk is not the only danger attendant on the surrender\r\nof the public money to the custody and control of local corporations.\r\nThough the object is aid to the Treasury, its effect may be to introduce\r\ninto the operations of the Government influences the most subtle,\r\nfounded on interests the most selfish.\r\n\r\nThe use by the banks, for their own benefit, of the money deposited with\r\nthem has received the sanction of the Government from the commencement\r\nof this connection. The money received from the people, instead of\r\nbeing kept till it is needed for their use, is, in consequence of this\r\nauthority, a fund on which discounts are made for the profit of those\r\nwho happen to be owners of stock in the banks selected as depositories.\r\nThe supposed and often exaggerated advantages of such a boon will always\r\ncause it to be sought for with avidity. I will not stop to consider\r\non whom the patronage incident to it is to be conferred. Whether the\r\nselection and control be trusted to Congress or to the Executive, either\r\nwill be subjected to appeals made in every form which the sagacity of\r\ninterest can suggest. The banks under such a system are stimulated to\r\nmake the most of their fortunate acquisition; the deposits are treated\r\nas an increase of capital; loans and circulation are rashly augmented,\r\nand when the public exigencies require a return it is attended with\r\nembarrassments not provided for nor foreseen. Thus banks that thought\r\nthemselves most fortunate when the public funds were received find\r\nthemselves most embarrassed when the season of payment suddenly arrives.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, too, the evils of the system are not limited to the\r\nbanks. It stimulates a general rashness of enterprise and aggravates the\r\nfluctuations of commerce and the currency. This result was strikingly\r\nexhibited during the operations of the late deposit system, and\r\nespecially in the purchases of public lands. The order which ultimately\r\ndirected the payment of gold and silver in such purchases greatly\r\nchecked, but could not altogether prevent, the evil. Specie was indeed\r\nmore difficult to be procured than the notes which the banks could\r\nthemselves create at pleasure; but still, being obtained from them as a\r\nloan and returned as a deposit, which they were again at liberty to use,\r\nit only passed round the circle with diminished speed. This operation\r\ncould not have been performed had the funds of the Government gone into\r\nthe Treasury to be regularly disbursed, and not into banks to be loaned\r\nout for their own profit while they were permitted to substitute for it\r\na credit in account.\r\n\r\nIn expressing these sentiments I desire not to undervalue the benefits\r\nof a salutary credit to any branch of enterprise. The credit bestowed\r\non probity and industry is the just reward of merit and an honorable\r\nincentive to further acquisition. None oppose it who love their country\r\nand understand its welfare. But when it is unduly encouraged; when it\r\nis made to inflame the public mind with the temptations of sudden and\r\nunsubstantial wealth; when it turns industry into paths that lead sooner\r\nor later to disappointment and distress, it becomes liable to censure\r\nand needs correction. Far from helping probity and industry, the ruin to\r\nwhich it leads falls most severely on the great laboring classes, who\r\nare thrown suddenly out of employment, and by the failure of magnificent\r\nschemes never intended to enrich them are deprived in a moment of their\r\nonly resource. Abuses of credit and excesses in speculation will happen\r\nin despite of the most salutary laws; no government, perhaps, can\r\naltogether prevent them, but surely every government can refrain from\r\ncontributing the stimulus that calls them into life.\r\n\r\nSince, therefore, experience has shown that to lend the public money\r\nto the local banks is hazardous to the operations of the Government, at\r\nleast of doubtful benefit to the institutions themselves, and productive\r\nof disastrous derangement in the business and currency of the country,\r\nis it the part of wisdom again to renew the connection?\r\n\r\nIt is true that such an agency is in many respects convenient to the\r\nTreasury, but it is not indispensable. A limitation of the expenses\r\nof the Government to its actual wants, and of the revenue to those\r\nexpenses, with convenient means for its prompt application to the\r\npurposes for which it was raised, are the objects which we should seek\r\nto accomplish. The collection, safe-keeping, transfer, and disbursement\r\nof the public money can, it is believed, be well managed by officers of\r\nthe Government. Its collection, and to a great extent its disbursement\r\nalso, have indeed been hitherto conducted solely by them, neither\r\nnational nor State banks, when employed, being required to do more than\r\nkeep it safely while in their custody, and transfer and pay it in such\r\nportions and at such times as the Treasury shall direct.\r\n\r\nSurely banks are not more able than the Government to secure the money\r\nin their possession against accident, violence, or fraud. The assertion\r\nthat they are so must assume that a vault in a bank is stronger than\r\na vault in the Treasury, and that directors, cashiers, and clerks not\r\nselected by the Government nor under its control are more worthy of\r\nconfidence than officers selected from the people and responsible to the\r\nGovernment--officers bound by official oaths and bonds for a faithful\r\nperformance of their duties, and constantly subject to the supervision\r\nof Congress.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties of transfer and the aid heretofore rendered by banks\r\nhave been less than is usually supposed. The actual accounts show that\r\nby far the larger portion of payments is made within short or convenient\r\ndistances from the places of collection; and the whole number of\r\nwarrants issued at the Treasury in the year 1834--a year the result of\r\nwhich will, it is believed, afford a safe test for the future--fell\r\nshort of 5,000, or an average of less than 1 daily for each State; in\r\nthe city of New York they did not average more than 2 a day, and at the\r\ncity of Washington only 4.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties heretofore existing are, moreover, daily lessened by an\r\nincrease in the cheapness and facility of communication, and it may be\r\nasserted with confidence that the necessary transfers, as well as the\r\nsafe-keeping and disbursements of the public moneys, can be with safety\r\nand convenience accomplished through the agencies of Treasury officers.\r\nThis opinion has been in some degree confirmed by actual experience\r\nsince the discontinuance of the banks as fiscal agents in May last--a\r\nperiod which from the embarrassments in commercial intercourse presented\r\nobstacles as great as any that may be hereafter apprehended.\r\n\r\nThe manner of keeping the public money since that period is fully stated\r\nin the report of the Secretary of the Treasury. That officer also\r\nsuggests the propriety of assigning by law certain additional duties to\r\nexisting establishments and officers, which, with the modifications and\r\nsafeguards referred to by him, will, he thinks, enable the Department\r\nto continue to perform this branch of the public service without any\r\nmaterial addition either to their number or to the present expense. The\r\nextent of the business to be transacted has already been stated; and in\r\nrespect to the amount of money with which the officers employed would be\r\nintrusted at any one time, it appears that, assuming a balance of five\r\nmillions to be at all times kept in the Treasury, and the whole of it\r\nleft in the hands of the collectors and receivers, the proportion of\r\neach would not exceed an average of $30,000; but that, deducting one\r\nmillion for the use of the Mint and assuming the remaining four millions\r\nto be in the hands of one-half of the present number of officers--a\r\nsupposition deemed more likely to correspond with the fact--the sum\r\nin the hands of each would still be less than the amount of most of the\r\nbonds now taken from the receivers of public money. Every apprehension,\r\nhowever, on the subject, either in respect to the safety of the money\r\nor the faithful discharge of these fiscal transactions, may, it appears\r\nto me, be effectually removed by adding to the present means of\r\nthe Treasury the establishment by law at a few important points of\r\noffices for the deposit and disbursement of such portions of the public\r\nrevenue as can not with obvious safety and convenience be left in the\r\npossession of the collecting officers until paid over by them to the\r\npublic creditors. Neither the amounts retained in their hands nor\r\nthose deposited in the offices would in an ordinary condition of the\r\nrevenue be larger in most cases than those often under the control of\r\ndisbursing officers of the Army and Navy, and might be made entirely\r\nsafe by requiring such securities and exercising such controlling\r\nsupervision as Congress may by law prescribe. The principal officers\r\nwhose appointments would become necessary under this plan, taking the\r\nlargest number suggested by the Secretary of the Treasury, would not\r\nexceed ten, nor the additional expenses, at the same estimate, $60,000\r\na year.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt of the obligation of those who are intrusted\r\nwith the affairs of Government to conduct them with as little cost to\r\nthe nation as is consistent with the public interest; and it is for\r\nCongress, and ultimately for the people, to decide whether the benefits\r\nto be derived from keeping our fiscal concerns apart and severing the\r\nconnection which has hitherto existed between the Government and banks\r\noffer sufficient advantages to justify the necessary expenses. If the\r\nobject to be accomplished is deemed important to the future welfare of\r\nthe country, I can not allow myself to believe that the addition to\r\nthe public expenditure of comparatively so small an amount as will be\r\nnecessary to effect it will be objected to by the people.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen by the report of the Postmaster-General herewith\r\ncommunicated that the fiscal affairs of that Department have been\r\nsuccessfully conducted since May last upon the principle of dealing\r\nonly in the legal currency of the United States, and that it needs no\r\nlegislation to maintain its credit and facilitate the management of its\r\nconcerns, the existing laws being, in the opinion of that officer, ample\r\nfor those objects.\r\n\r\nDifficulties will doubtless be encountered for a season and increased\r\nservices required from the public functionaries; such are usually\r\nincident to the commencement of every system, but they will be greatly\r\nlessened in the progress of its operations.\r\n\r\nThe power and influence supposed to be connected with the custody and\r\ndisbursement of the public money are topics on which the public mind is\r\nnaturally, and with great propriety, peculiarly sensitive. Much has been\r\nsaid on them in reference to the proposed separation of the Government\r\nfrom the banking institutions; and surely no one can object to any\r\nappeals or animadversions on the subject which are consistent with facts\r\nand evince a proper respect for the intelligence of the people. If a\r\nChief Magistrate may be allowed to speak for himself on such a point,\r\nI can truly say that to me nothing would be more acceptable than the\r\nwithdrawal from the Executive, to the greatest practicable extent, of\r\nall concern in the custody and disbursement of the public revenue; not\r\nthat I would shrink from any responsibility cast upon me by the duties\r\nof my office, but because it is my firm belief that its capacity for\r\nusefulness is in no degree promoted by the possession of any patronage\r\nnot actually necessary to the performance of those duties. But under our\r\npresent form of government the intervention of the executive officers\r\nin the custody and disbursement of the public money seems to be\r\nunavoidable; and before it can be admitted that the influence and power\r\nof the Executive would be increased by dispensing with the agency of\r\nbanks the nature of that intervention in such an agency must be\r\ncarefully regarded, and a comparison must be instituted between its\r\nextent in the two cases.\r\n\r\nThe revenue can only be collected by officers appointed by the President\r\nwith the advice and consent of the Senate. The public moneys in the\r\nfirst instance must therefore in all cases pass through hands selected\r\nby the Executive. Other officers appointed in the same way, or, as in\r\nsome cases, by the President alone, must also be intrusted with them\r\nwhen drawn for the purpose of disbursement. It is thus seen that even\r\nwhen banks are employed the public funds must twice pass through the\r\nhands of executive officers. Besides this, the head of the Treasury\r\nDepartment, who also holds office at the pleasure of the President, and\r\nsome other officers of the same Department, must necessarily be invested\r\nwith more or less power in the selection, continuance, and supervision\r\nof the banks that may be employed. The question is then narrowed to the\r\nsingle point whether in the intermediate stage between the collection\r\nand disbursement of the public money the agency of banks is necessary\r\nto avoid a dangerous extension of the patronage and influence of the\r\nExecutive. But is it clear that the connection of the Executive with\r\npowerful moneyed institutions, capable of ministering to the interests\r\nof men in points where they are most accessible to corruption, is less\r\nliable to abuse than his constitutional agency in the appointment and\r\ncontrol of the few public officers required by the proposed plan? Will\r\nthe public money when in their hands be necessarily exposed to any\r\nimproper interference on the part of the Executive? May it not be hoped\r\nthat a prudent fear of public jealousy and disapprobation in a matter so\r\npeculiarly exposed to them will deter him from any such interference,\r\neven if higher motives be found inoperative? May not Congress so\r\nregulate by law the duty of those officers and subject it to such\r\nsupervision and publicity as to prevent the possibility of any serious\r\nabuse on the part of the Executive? And is there equal room for such\r\nsupervision and publicity in a connection with banks, acting under the\r\nshield of corporate immunities and conducted by persons irresponsible\r\nto the Government and the people? It is believed that a considerate and\r\ncandid investigation of these questions will result in the conviction\r\nthat the proposed plan is far less liable to objection on the score of\r\nExecutive patronage and control than any bank agency that has been or\r\ncan be devised.\r\n\r\nWith these views I leave to Congress the measures necessary to regulate\r\nin the present emergency the safe-keeping and transfer of the public\r\nmoneys. In the performance of constitutional duty I have stated to them\r\nwithout reserve the result of my own reflections. The subject is of\r\ngreat importance, and one on which we can scarcely expect to be as\r\nunited in sentiment as we are in interest. It deserves a full and\r\nfree discussion, and can not fail to be benefited by a dispassionate\r\ncomparison of opinions. Well aware myself of the duty of reciprocal\r\nconcession among the coordinate branches of the Government, I can\r\npromise a reasonable spirit of cooperation, so far as it can be indulged\r\nin without the surrender of constitutional objections which I believe\r\nto be well founded. Any system that may be adopted should be subjected\r\nto the fullest legal provision, so as to leave nothing to the Executive\r\nbut what is necessary to the discharge of the duties imposed on him;\r\nand whatever plan may be ultimately established, my own part shall be\r\nso discharged as to give to it a fair trial and the best prospect of\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nThe character of the funds to be received and disbursed in the\r\ntransactions of the Government likewise demands your most careful\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that those who framed and adopted the\r\nConstitution, having in immediate view the depreciated paper of the\r\nConfederacy--of which $500 in paper were at times only equal to $1 in\r\ncoin--intended to prevent the recurrence of similar evils, so far at\r\nleast as related to the transactions of the new Government. They gave\r\nto Congress express powers to coin money and to regulate the value\r\nthereof and of foreign coin; they refused to give it power to establish\r\ncorporations--the agents then as now chiefly employed to create a paper\r\ncurrency; they prohibited the States from making anything but gold\r\nand silver a legal tender in payment of debts; and the First Congress\r\ndirected by positive law that the revenue should be received in nothing\r\nbut gold and silver.\r\n\r\nPublic exigency at the outset of the Government, without direct\r\nlegislative authority, led to the use of banks as fiscal aids to the\r\nTreasury. In admitted deviation from the law, at the same period and\r\nunder the same exigency, the Secretary of the Treasury received their\r\nnotes in payment of duties. The sole ground on which the practice\r\nthus commenced was then or has since been justified is the certain,\r\nimmediate, and convenient exchange of such notes for specie. The\r\nGovernment did, indeed, receive the inconvertible notes of State banks\r\nduring the difficulties of war, and the community submitted without a\r\nmurmur to the unequal taxation and multiplied evils of which such a\r\ncourse was productive. With the war this indulgence ceased, and the\r\nbanks were obliged again to redeem their notes in gold and silver. The\r\nTreasury, in accordance with previous practice, continued to dispense\r\nwith the currency required by the act of 1789, and took the notes of\r\nbanks in full confidence of their being paid in specie on demand; and\r\nCongress, to guard against the slightest violation of this principle,\r\nhave declared by law that if notes are paid in the transactions of the\r\nGovernment it must be under such circumstances as to enable the holder\r\nto convert them into specie without depreciation or delay.\r\n\r\nOf my own duties under the existing laws, when the banks suspended\r\nspecie payments, I could not doubt. Directions were immediately given\r\nto prevent the reception into the Treasury of anything but gold and\r\nsilver, or its equivalent, and every practicable arrangement was made\r\nto preserve the public faith by similar or equivalent payments to\r\nthe public creditors. The revenue from lands had been for some time\r\nsubstantially so collected under the order issued by directions of my\r\npredecessor. The effects of that order had been so salutary and its\r\nforecast in regard to the increasing insecurity of bank paper had become\r\nso apparent that even before the catastrophe I had resolved not to\r\ninterfere with its operation. Congress is now to decide whether the\r\nrevenue shall continue to be so collected or not.\r\n\r\nThe receipt into the Treasury of bank notes not redeemed in specie on\r\ndemand will not, I presume, be sanctioned. It would destroy without the\r\nexcuse of war or public distress that equality of imposts and identity\r\nof commercial regulation which lie at the foundation of our Confederacy,\r\nand would offer to each State a direct temptation to increase its\r\nforeign trade by depreciating the currency received for duties in its\r\nports. Such a proceeding would also in a great degree frustrate the\r\npolicy so highly cherished of infusing into our circulation a larger\r\nproportion of the precious metals--a policy the wisdom of which none can\r\ndoubt, though there may be different opinions as to the extent to which\r\nit should be carried. Its results have been already too auspicious and\r\nits success is too closely interwoven with the future prosperity of\r\nthe country to permit us for a moment to contemplate its abandonment.\r\nWe have seen under its influence our specie augmented beyond eighty\r\nmillions, our coinage increased so as to make that of gold amount,\r\nbetween August, 1834, and December, 1836, to $10,000,000, exceeding\r\nthe whole coinage at the Mint during the thirty-one previous years.\r\n\r\nThe prospect of further improvement continued without abatement until\r\nthe moment of the suspension of specie payments. This policy has now,\r\nindeed, been suddenly checked, but is still far from being overthrown.\r\nAmidst all conflicting theories, one position is undeniable--the\r\nprecious metals will invariably disappear when there ceases to be\r\na necessity for their use as a circulating medium. It was in strict\r\naccordance with this truth that whilst in the month of May last they\r\nwere everywhere seen and were current for all ordinary purposes they\r\ndisappeared from circulation the moment the payment of specie was\r\nrefused by the banks and the community tacitly agreed to dispense with\r\nits employment. Their place was supplied by a currency exclusively of\r\npaper, and in many cases of the worst description. Already are the bank\r\nnotes now in circulation greatly depreciated, and they fluctuate in\r\nvalue between one place and another, thus diminishing and making\r\nuncertain the worth of property and the price of labor, and failing to\r\nsubserve, except at a heavy loss, the purposes of business. With each\r\nsucceeding day the metallic currency decreases; by some it is hoarded\r\nin the natural fear that once parted with it can not be replaced, while\r\nby others it is diverted from its more legitimate uses for the sake\r\nof gain. Should Congress sanction this condition of things by making\r\nirredeemable paper money receivable in payment of public dues, a\r\ntemporary check to a wise and salutary policy will in all probability\r\nbe converted into its absolute destruction.\r\n\r\nIt is true that bank notes actually convertible into specie may be\r\nreceived in payment of the revenue without being liable to all these\r\nobjections, and that such a course may to some extent promote individual\r\nconvenience--an object always to be considered where it does not\r\nconflict with the principles of our Government or the general welfare\r\nof the country. If such notes only were received, and always under\r\ncircumstances allowing their early presentation for payment, and if at\r\nshort and fixed periods they were converted into specie to be kept by\r\nthe officers of the Treasury, some of the most serious obstacles to\r\ntheir reception would perhaps be removed. To retain the notes in the\r\nTreasury would be to renew under another form the loans of public money\r\nto the banks, and the evils consequent thereon.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, a mistaken impression that any large amount of specie\r\nis required for public payments. Of the seventy or eighty millions\r\nnow estimated to be in the country, ten millions would be abundantly\r\nsufficient for that purpose provided an accumulation of a large amount\r\nof revenue beyond the necessary wants of the Government be hereafter\r\nprevented. If to these considerations be added the facilities which will\r\narise from enabling the Treasury to satisfy the public creditors by its\r\ndrafts or notes receivable in payment of the public dues, it may be\r\nsafely assumed that no motive of convenience to the citizen requires\r\nthe reception of bank paper.\r\n\r\nTo say that the refusal of paper money by the Government introduces an\r\nunjust discrimination between the currency received by it and that used\r\nby individuals in their ordinary affairs is, in my judgment, to view it\r\nin a very erroneous light. The Constitution prohibits the States from\r\nmaking anything but gold and silver a tender in the payment of debts,\r\nand thus secures to every citizen a right to demand payment in the legal\r\ncurrency. To provide by law that the Government will only receive its\r\ndues in gold and silver is not to confer on it any peculiar privilege,\r\nbut merely to place it on an equality with the citizen by reserving to\r\nit a right secured to him by the Constitution. It is doubtless for this\r\nreason that the principle has been sanctioned by successive laws from\r\nthe time of the first Congress under the Constitution down to the last.\r\nSuch precedents, never objected to and proceeding from such sources,\r\nafford a decisive answer to the imputation of inequality or injustice.\r\n\r\nBut in fact the measure is one of restriction, not of favor. To forbid\r\nthe public agent to receive in payment any other than a certain kind of\r\nmoney is to refuse him a discretion possessed by every citizen. It may\r\nbe left to those who have the management of their own transactions to\r\nmake their own terms, but no such discretion should be given to him who\r\nacts merely as an agent of the people--who is to collect what the law\r\nrequires and to pay the appropriations it makes. When bank notes are\r\nredeemed on demand, there is then no discrimination in reality, for the\r\nindividual who receives them may at his option substitute the specie for\r\nthem; he takes them from convenience or choice. When they are not so\r\nredeemed, it will scarcely be contended that their receipt and payment\r\nby a public officer should be permitted, though none deny that right\r\nto an individual; if it were, the effect would be most injurious to\r\nthe public, since their officer could make none of those arrangements\r\nto meet or guard against the depreciation which an individual is at\r\nliberty to do. Nor can inconvenience to the community be alleged as\r\nan objection to such a regulation. Its object and motive are their\r\nconvenience and welfare.\r\n\r\nIf at a moment of simultaneous and unexpected suspension by the banks\r\nit adds something to the many embarrassments of that proceeding, yet\r\nthese are far overbalanced by its direct tendency to produce a wider\r\ncirculation of gold and silver, to increase the safety of bank paper,\r\nto improve the general currency, and thus to prevent altogether such\r\noccurrences and the other and far greater evils that attend them.\r\n\r\nIt may indeed be questioned whether it is not for the interest of the\r\nbanks themselves that the Government should not receive their paper.\r\nThey would be conducted with more caution and on sounder principles.\r\nBy using specie only in its transactions the Government would create a\r\ndemand for it, which would to a great extent prevent its exportation,\r\nand by keeping it in circulation maintain a broader and safer basis for\r\nthe paper currency. That the banks would thus be rendered more sound\r\nand the community more safe can not admit of a doubt.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing views, it seems to me, do but fairly carry out the\r\nprovisions of the Federal Constitution in relation to the currency, as\r\nfar as relates to the public revenue. At the time that instrument was\r\nframed there were but three or four banks in the United States, and had\r\nthe extension of the banking system and the evils growing out of it\r\nbeen foreseen they would probably have been specially guarded against.\r\nThe same policy which led to the prohibition of bills of credit by the\r\nStates would doubtless in that event have also interdicted their issue\r\nas a currency in any other form. The Constitution, however, contains no\r\nsuch prohibition; and since the States have exercised for nearly half\r\na century the power to regulate the business of banking, it is not to\r\nbe expected that it will be abandoned. The whole matter is now under\r\ndiscussion before the proper tribunal--the people of the States. Never\r\nbefore has the public mind been so thoroughly awakened to a proper\r\nsense of its importance; never has the subject in all its bearings\r\nbeen submitted to so searching an inquiry. It would be distrusting the\r\nintelligence and virtue of the people to doubt the speedy and efficient\r\nadoption of such measures of reform as the public good demands. All\r\nthat can rightfully be done by the Federal Government to promote the\r\naccomplishment of that important object will without doubt be performed.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime it is our duty to provide all the remedies against a\r\ndepreciated paper currency which the Constitution enables us to afford.\r\nThe Treasury Department on several former occasions has suggested the\r\npropriety and importance of a uniform law concerning bankruptcies of\r\ncorporations and other bankers. Through the instrumentality of such a\r\nlaw a salutary check may doubtless be imposed on the issues of paper\r\nmoney and an effectual remedy given to the citizen in a way at once\r\nequal in all parts of the Union and fully authorized by the\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\nThe indulgence granted by Executive authority in the payment of bonds\r\nfor duties has been already mentioned. Seeing that the immediate\r\nenforcement of these obligations would subject a large and highly\r\nrespectable portion of our citizens to great sacrifices, and believing\r\nthat a temporary postponement could be made without detriment to other\r\ninterests and with increased certainty of ultimate payment, I did not\r\nhesitate to comply with the request that was made of me. The terms\r\nallowed are to the full extent as liberal as any that are to be found\r\nin the practice of the executive department. It remains for Congress to\r\ndecide whether a further postponement may not with propriety be allowed;\r\nand if so, their legislation upon the subject is respectfully invited.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Treasury will exhibit the condition\r\nof these debts, the extent and effect of the present indulgence, the\r\nprobable result of its further extension on the state of the Treasury,\r\nand every other fact necessary to a full consideration of the subject.\r\nSimilar information is communicated in regard to such depositories of\r\nthe public moneys as are indebted to the Government, in order that\r\nCongress may also adopt the proper measures in regard to them.\r\n\r\nThe receipts and expenditures for the first half of the year and an\r\nestimate of those for the residue will be laid before you by the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury. In his report of December last it was\r\nestimated that the current receipts would fall short of the expenditures\r\nby about $3,000,000. It will be seen that the difference will be much\r\ngreater. This is to be attributed not only to the occurrence of greater\r\npecuniary embarrassments in the business of the country than those\r\nwhich were then predicted, and consequently a greater diminution in\r\nthe revenue, but also to the fact that the appropriations exceeded by\r\nnearly six millions the amount which was asked for in the estimates\r\nthen submitted. The sum necessary for the service of the year, beyond\r\nthe probable receipts and the amount which it was intended should be\r\nreserved in the Treasury at the commencement of the year, will be about\r\nsix millions. If the whole of the reserved balance be not at once\r\napplied to the current expenditures, but four millions be still kept\r\nin the Treasury, as seems most expedient for the uses of the Mint and\r\nto meet contingencies, the sum needed will be ten millions.\r\n\r\nIn making this estimate the receipts are calculated on the supposition\r\nof some further extension of the indulgence granted in the payment of\r\nbonds for duties, which will affect the amount of the revenue for the\r\npresent year to the extent of two and a half millions.\r\n\r\nIt is not proposed to procure the required amount by loans or increased\r\ntaxation. There are now in the Treasury $9,367,214, directed by the act\r\nof the 23d of June, 1836, to be deposited with the States in October\r\nnext. This sum, if so deposited, will be subject under the law to be\r\nrecalled if needed to defray existing appropriations; and as it is now\r\nevident that the whole, or the principal part, of it will be wanted\r\nfor that purpose, it appears most proper that the deposit should be\r\nwithheld. Until the amount can be collected from the banks, Treasury\r\nnotes may be temporarily issued, to be gradually redeemed as it is\r\nreceived.\r\n\r\nI am aware that this course may be productive of inconvenience to many\r\nof the States. Relying upon the acts of Congress which held out to\r\nthem the strong probability, if not the certainty, of receiving this\r\ninstallment, they have in some instances adopted measures with which\r\nits retention may seriously interfere. That such a condition of things\r\nshould have occurred is much to be regretted. It is not the least among\r\nthe unfortunate results of the disasters of the times; and it is for\r\nCongress to devise a fit remedy, if there be one. The money being\r\nindispensable to the wants of the Treasury, it is difficult to conceive\r\nupon what principle of justice or expediency its application to that\r\nobject can be avoided. To recall any portion of the sums already\r\ndeposited with the States would be more inconvenient and less efficient.\r\nTo burden the country with increased taxation when there is in fact a\r\nlarge surplus revenue would be unjust and unwise; to raise moneys by\r\nloans under such circumstances, and thus to commence a new national\r\ndebt, would scarcely be sanctioned by the American people.\r\n\r\nThe plan proposed will be adequate to all our fiscal operations during\r\nthe remainder of the year. Should it be adopted, the Treasury, aided by\r\nthe ample resources of the country, will be able to discharge punctually\r\nevery pecuniary obligation. For the future all that is needed will be\r\nthat caution and forbearance in appropriations which the diminution of\r\nthe revenue requires and which the complete accomplishment or great\r\nforwardness of many expensive national undertakings renders equally\r\nconsistent with prudence and patriotic liberality.\r\n\r\nThe preceding suggestions and recommendations are submitted in the\r\nbelief that their adoption by Congress will enable the executive\r\ndepartment to conduct our fiscal concerns with success so far as their\r\nmanagement has been committed to it. Whilst the objects and the means\r\nproposed to attain them are within its constitutional powers and\r\nappropriate duties, they will at the same time, it is hoped, by their\r\nnecessary operation, afford essential aid in the transaction of\r\nindividual concerns, and thus yield relief to the people at large in\r\na form adapted to the nature of our Government. Those who look to the\r\naction of this Government for specific aid to the citizen to relieve\r\nembarrassments arising from losses by revulsions in commerce and credit\r\nlose sight of the ends for which it was created and the powers with\r\nwhich it is clothed. It was established to give security to us all\r\nin our lawful and honorable pursuits, under the lasting safeguard of\r\nrepublican institutions. It was not intended to confer special favors on\r\nindividuals or on any classes of them, to create systems of agriculture,\r\nmanufactures, or trade, or to engage in them either separately or in\r\nconnection with individual citizens or organized associations. If\r\nits operations were to be directed for the benefit of any one class,\r\nequivalent favors must in justice be extended to the rest, and the\r\nattempt to bestow such favors with an equal hand, or even to select\r\nthose who should most deserve them, would never be successful.\r\n\r\nAll communities are apt to look to government for too much. Even in\r\nour own country, where its powers and duties are so strictly limited,\r\nwe are prone to do so, especially at periods of sudden embarrassment\r\nand distress. But this ought not to be. The framers of our excellent\r\nConstitution and the people who approved it with calm and sagacious\r\ndeliberation acted at the time on a sounder principle. They wisely\r\njudged that the less government interferes with private pursuits the\r\nbetter for the general prosperity. It is not its legitimate object to\r\nmake men rich or to repair by direct grants of money or legislation in\r\nfavor of particular pursuits losses not incurred in the public service.\r\nThis would be substantially to use the property of some for the benefit\r\nof others. But its real duty--that duty the performance of which makes\r\na good government the most precious of human blessings--is to enact and\r\nenforce a system of general laws commensurate with, but not exceeding,\r\nthe objects of its establishment, and to leave every citizen and every\r\ninterest to reap under its benign protection the rewards of virtue,\r\nindustry, and prudence.\r\n\r\nI can not doubt that on this as on all similar occasions the Federal\r\nGovernment will find its agency most conducive to the security and\r\nhappiness of the people when limited to the exercise of its conceded\r\npowers. In never assuming, even for a well-meant object, such powers as\r\nwere not designed to be conferred upon it, we shall in reality do most\r\nfor the general welfare. To avoid every unnecessary interference with\r\nthe pursuits of the citizen will result in more benefit than to adopt\r\nmeasures which could only assist limited interests, and are eagerly,\r\nbut perhaps naturally, sought for under the pressure of temporary\r\ncircumstances. If, therefore, I refrain from suggesting to Congress any\r\nspecific plan for regulating the exchanges of the country, relieving\r\nmercantile embarrassments, or interfering with the ordinary operations\r\nof foreign or domestic commerce, it is from a conviction that such\r\nmeasures are not within the constitutional province of the General\r\nGovernment, and that their adoption would not promote the real and\r\npermanent welfare of those they might be designed to aid.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties and distresses of the times, though unquestionably\r\ngreat, are limited in their extent, and can not be regarded as affecting\r\nthe permanent prosperity of the nation. Arising in a great degree from\r\nthe transactions of foreign and domestic commerce, it is upon them\r\nthat they have chiefly fallen. The great agricultural interest has in\r\nmany parts of the country suffered comparatively little, and, as if\r\nProvidence intended to display the munificence of its goodness at the\r\nmoment of our greatest need, and in direct contrast to the evils\r\noccasioned by the waywardness of man, we have been blessed throughout\r\nour extended territory with a season of general health and of uncommon\r\nfruitfulness. The proceeds of our great staples will soon furnish the\r\nmeans of liquidating debts at home and abroad, and contribute equally\r\nto the revival of commercial activity and the restoration of commercial\r\ncredit. The banks, established avowedly for its support, deriving their\r\nprofits from it, and resting under obligations to it which can not be\r\noverlooked, will feel at once the necessity and justice of uniting their\r\nenergies with those of the mercantile interest.\r\n\r\nThe suspension of specie payments at such a time and under such\r\ncircumstances as we have lately witnessed could not be other than a\r\ntemporary measure, and we can scarcely err in believing that the period\r\nmust soon arrive when all that are solvent will redeem their issues\r\nin gold and silver. Dealings abroad naturally depend on resources and\r\nprosperity at home. If the debt of our merchants has accumulated or\r\ntheir credit is impaired, these are fluctuations always incident to\r\nextensive or extravagant mercantile transactions. But the ultimate\r\nsecurity of such obligations does not admit of question. They are\r\nguaranteed by the resources of a country the fruits of whose industry\r\nafford abundant means of ample liquidation, and by the evident interest\r\nof every merchant to sustain a credit hitherto high by promptly applying\r\nthese means for its preservation.\r\n\r\nI deeply regret that events have occurred which require me to ask your\r\nconsideration of such serious topics. I could have wished that in making\r\nmy first communication to the assembled representatives of my country\r\nI had nothing to dwell upon but the history of her unalloyed prosperity.\r\nSince it is otherwise, we can only feel more deeply the responsibility\r\nof the respective trusts that have been confided to us, and under the\r\npressure of difficulties unite in invoking the guidance and aid of the\r\nSupreme Ruler of Nations and in laboring with zealous resolution to\r\novercome the difficulties by which we are environed.\r\n\r\nIt is under such circumstances a high gratification to know by\r\nlong experience that we act for a people to whom the truth, however\r\nunpromising, can always be spoken with safety; for the trial of whose\r\npatriotism no emergency is too severe, and who are sure never to\r\ndesert a public functionary honestly laboring for the public good.\r\nIt seems just that they should receive without delay any aid in their\r\nembarrassments which your deliberations can afford. Coming directly from\r\nthe midst of them, and knowing the course of events in every section of\r\nour country, from you may best be learnt as well the extent and nature\r\nof these embarrassments as the most desirable measures of relief.\r\n\r\nI am aware, however, that it is not proper to detain you at present\r\nlonger than may be demanded by the special objects for which you are\r\nconvened. To them, therefore, I have confined my communication; and\r\nbelieving it will not be your own wish now to extend your deliberations\r\nbeyond them, I reserve till the usual period of your annual meeting that\r\ngeneral information on the state of the Union which the Constitution\r\nrequires me to give.\r\n\r\nM.

DUNLAP.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATE OF MAINE, HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,\r\n\r\n_MARCH 29, 1837_.\r\n\r\nThe joint select committee who had under consideration the order\r\nrelating to the expediency of calling the attention of Congress to the\r\nsubject of fortifying our maritime and interior frontier have attended\r\nto that duty, and ask leave to present the following report:\r\n\r\nOne object of the federal compact is \"to provide for the common defense\r\nand general welfare.\"\r\n\r\nIn accordance with these objects of the compact, the General Government\r\nhas from time to time made liberal appropriations for fortifying and\r\ndefending the several States along our extended maritime frontier west\r\nand south of the western boundary line of this State. East of that line\r\na mere trifle has as yet been appropriated for these objects.\r\n\r\nMaine has a maritime frontier of about 500 miles in extent, following\r\nthe indentations of her shores, and our interior frontier, bounding on\r\nNew Brunswick on the east and the Canadas on the north, is about 600\r\nmiles in extent.\r\n\r\nConsidering this great extent of seacoast, her numerous excellent\r\nharbors, her noble rivers and great advantages for shipbuilding, and\r\nher proximity to the fishing grounds, probably no State in the Union\r\npossesses the natural advantages for carrying on this branch of industry\r\nthat Maine does.\r\n\r\nIt is a fact worthy of consideration that all maritime nations have\r\nlooked to their fisheries as the nursery of hardy seamen for the\r\nmerchant service in time of peace and for the navy in time of war, and\r\nas a great question of national policy (aside from the inducement to\r\nencourage this branch of business as an unfailing source of natural\r\nwealth) it is deemed worthy of the fostering care of all commercial\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nAlready the navigation of Maine is estimated at more than 300,000 tons,\r\nand exceeded by only two States in the Union, and her increase annually\r\nof tonnage is greater than that of any other State.\r\n\r\nThe abundance of building materials, believed to be inexhaustible, her\r\ngreat conveniences for shipbuilding along her extended seacoast, her\r\nnumerous bays, rivers, and harbors, render it highly probable that the\r\nday is not far distant when the maritime interests of Maine will exceed\r\nthat of any of her sister States; and if reliance can be placed upon the\r\nstatements of a scientific engineer of high respectability and standing,\r\nwho has during the past year, under the direction of the government of\r\nthis State and our parent Commonwealth, made a geological survey of\r\na portion of our State, it may be doubted whether the same extent of\r\nterritory on the continent contains more real value viewed in all its\r\nbearings (the facilities of quarrying, manufacturing, exporting, and\r\nits influence upon the great interests of the State and nation) than is\r\ncontained in our inexhaustible quarries of granite, lime, marble, slate,\r\netc., mines and minerals in which large and profitable investments are\r\nalready made. Some of these branches of business have been carried on\r\nfor many years, and others to a large extent are commencing under the\r\nmost favorable auspices.\r\n\r\nThese, together with our agricultural, commercial, and manufacturing\r\ninterests, our immense forests of invaluable timber, with a water power\r\nof vast extent and value, giving us the means of laying the seaports\r\nof the Union under a contribution for ages to come, and warranting the\r\nbelief that our present shipping interest will be sustained and employed\r\nand a great increase required.\r\n\r\nAbout one-third of the most valuable portion of our territory is claimed\r\nby Great Britain, and the history of this protracted controversy from\r\nits commencement to the present time is such as to awaken general\r\nanxiety. We are admonished by recent events that we have not yet reached\r\nthe termination of our toils and embarrassments, and they have awakened\r\nthe painful apprehension that our just rights may not be secured by\r\nhonorable negotiation or patient submission to unprovoked injuries.\r\nThese considerations, in the opinion of your committee, call loudly for\r\nthe interposition of the General Government, and require at their hands\r\nall needful preparation for possible contingencies. The late Governor\r\nLincoln nearly ten years since called the attention of the Government\r\nto the importance of erecting a strong fortification in some eligible\r\nposition on the confines of that portion of our territory to which\r\nan adverse claim is set up by Great Britain. In the opinion of your\r\ncommittee, the subject has lost none of its interest since that\r\nperiod, but, on the contrary, the events to which we have alluded\r\ngive to it vastly augmented importance; and to our view, irrespective\r\nof any conditions growing out of the present controversy, a strong\r\nfortification upon the northeastern boundary of the United States,\r\nsituated far in the interior and upon the confines of a foreign country,\r\nand surrounded by millions of acres of fertile land, destined soon to\r\nbe peopled with a numerous population of hardy yeomanry, is of high\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nOur isolated situation, being the northeastern boundary of the\r\nnation, with an interior frontier upward of 600 miles upon a foreign\r\ncountry and a large proportion of our territory lying between two\r\nProvinces of Great Britain and so situated as to render it greatly to\r\nthe advantage of that nation to possess it; the inflexible determination\r\nwhich she manifests to pursue the course which interest dictates should\r\nnot be forgotten; the extent of our seacoast; the exposed situation of\r\nour seaport towns, lying within a few hours' sail of the British naval\r\ndepot in the neighborhood of Maine; the disastrous consequences of our\r\ndefenseless situation during the last war; the great and increasing\r\nmaritime interests which we have at stake without one single point where\r\na ship, if dependent upon the United States fortifications, would be\r\nsafe from the attacks of a frigate--these and the consideration that\r\nlittle, comparatively, has yet been done for Maine seem to our view to\r\nconstitute irresistible reasons why Maine should no longer be forgotten\r\nor neglected in the common defense of the country.\r\n\r\nThrough all the long-protracted struggles, difficulties, and\r\nembarrassments of our infant Republic this portion of our Union has\r\nnever been urgent or importunate in pressing its claims, but has\r\nsubmitted patiently to the force of circumstances which rendered it\r\nnecessary to defer them.\r\n\r\nBut in the present altered condition of the country--the national debt\r\npaid off at a season of universal peace and unexampled prosperity, with\r\nan overburthened Treasury, and when it is deemed necessary to dispose\r\nof it to resort to measures which many eminent statesmen consider\r\nunwarranted by the Constitution and which a great portion of the people\r\nof the Union consider of doubtful policy--at such a period and under\r\nsuch circumstances it is difficult to perceive the justice of longer\r\nwithholding suitable appropriations for the defense of Maine, and to\r\nour view it can only be withheld by doing violence to the principles\r\nof equal rights and by neglecting a plain constitutional duty.\r\n\r\nYour committee therefore submit the following resolutions.\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN C. FOSTER,\r\n\r\n_Chairman_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATE OF MAINE.\r\n\r\nRESOLVE relating to the fortification of frontier States.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That the obligation of the Federal Government, under\r\nthe Constitution, when it has the means to erect suitable fortifications\r\nfor the defense of the frontier of the States, is a practical duty not\r\njustly to be denied, evaded, neglected, or delayed.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That our Senators in Congress be instructed and our\r\nRepresentatives requested to use their influence to obtain liberal\r\nappropriations for the defense of Maine and the Union.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That the governor be requested to transmit copies of\r\nthe above report and resolutions to the President and Vice-President,\r\nthe Secretaries of State, Navy, and War, and to each of our Senators\r\nand Representatives in Congress.\r\n\r\n[Passed by both Houses and approved March 30, 1837.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATE OF MAINE, EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT,\r\n\r\n_Augusta, April 30, 1837_.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency MARTIN VAN BUREN,\r\n\r\n_President of the United States_.\r\n\r\nSIR: In compliance with a request of the legislature of this State, I\r\nhave the honor to transmit to Your Excellency the accompanying report\r\nand resolutions:\r\n\r\nIn behalf of the State of Maine, I would respectfully, yet urgently,\r\ncall on the President of the United States to cause the northeastern\r\nboundary of this State to be explored and surveyed and monuments erected\r\nin accordance with the request contained in the resolutions which are\r\nherewith communicated. As the subject is one in which the people of\r\nMaine have a deep interest, I feel a confidence it will commend itself\r\nto your early attention.\r\n\r\nWith high consideration, I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nROBERT P. DUNLAP.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATE OF MAINE, IN HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,\r\n\r\n_FEBRUARY 2, 1837_.\r\n\r\nThe joint committee to whom was referred so much of the governor's\r\nmessage as relates to the northeastern boundary, and the documents and\r\nevidence, together with an order of the two houses instructing the\r\ncommittee \"to inquire into the expediency of providing by law for the\r\nappointment of commissioners on the part of this State, by the consent\r\nof the Government of the United States, to survey the line between this\r\nState and the Province of New Brunswick according to the treaty of 1783,\r\nto establish monuments in such places as shall be fixed by said\r\ncommissioners and by commissioners to be appointed on the part of the\r\nGovernment of Great Britain, have attended to the duties assigned them\r\nwith the industry and solicitude which the importance of the subject\r\ndemanded. Could the committee have spared the time and had the means\r\nto obtain documents not within the jurisdiction of the State, and\r\nconsequently out of its power, a more clear, methodical, and perfect\r\nview of the subject would have been presented; but as there had been\r\nhitherto so much procrastination and the impatience of the public,\r\nalready great, was becoming more and more intense, your committee\r\nwithout further preamble or apology ask leave to present the following\r\nreport:\r\n\r\nThe legislature and people of Maine, we believe, will not contend that\r\nthe treaty-making power of the United States does not extend to a final\r\nadjustment of a disputed and undefined line of boundary between a State\r\nand a foreign nation; _but we do insist_ that no power is granted by the\r\nConstitution of the United States to _limit_ or _change the boundary\r\nof a State or cede a part of its territory without its consent_. It is\r\neven by no means certain how far _such consent_ would enable the treaty\r\nauthority to exert its powers. _Citizens_ might be made the subjects of\r\na treaty transfer, and these citizens owing allegiance to the State and\r\nto the Union, and allegiance and protection being reciprocally binding,\r\nthe right to transfer a citizen to a foreign government, to _sell_ him,\r\nmight well be questioned as being inconsistent with the spirit of our\r\nfree institutions. But be this as it may, Maine will never concede the\r\nprinciple that the President and two-thirds of the Senate can transfer\r\nits territory, much less its citizens, without its permission, given by\r\nits constitutional organs.\r\n\r\nYour committee, however, deem it but fair to admit that they have\r\ndiscovered no inclination in the General Government, or any department\r\nof it, to assume this power. On the contrary, the President has\r\nrepeatedly declined the adoption of a conventional line deviating from\r\nthe treaty of 1783, upon the express ground that it could not be done\r\nwithout the consent of Maine.\r\n\r\nIt is due, nevertheless, to the State of Maine to say that the committee\r\nhave no evidence that any conventional line has been proposed to them\r\nfor their consent. It indeed appears that the consent of Maine had not\r\nbeen given to the adoption of any other boundary than that prescribed\r\nby the treaty of 1783 up to the 29th February, 1836, and we are well\r\nassured that no proposition for a different boundary has since that\r\ntime been made to any department of the government of this State.\r\n\r\nThe President of the United States on the 15th June last\r\ncommunicated to the Senate, in compliance with their resolution, a\r\ncopy of the correspondence relative to the northeastern boundary. This\r\ncorrespondence embraced a period from the 21st July, 1832, to the 5th\r\nMarch, 1836.\r\n\r\nThe opinion and advice of the King of the Netherlands, to whom the\r\ncontroversy was referred by the provisions of the treaty of Ghent, was\r\nmade on the 10th January, 1831, and of the three questions submitted,\r\nviz, _the northeastern boundary, the northwesternmost head of Connecticut\r\nRiver_, and _the forty-fifth parallel of latitude_, he seems to have\r\ndetermined _but one_. He did decide that the source of the stream\r\nrunning into and through Connecticut Lake is the true northwest head of\r\nthat river as intended by the treaty of 1783; and as to the rest, he\r\n_advises_ that it will be _convenient (il conviendra)_ to adopt the\r\n\"Thalweg,\" the deepest channel of the St. John and St. Francis, for the\r\nnorth line, and that the forty-fifth degree is to be measured in order\r\nto mark out the boundary to the St. Lawrence, with a deviation so as to\r\ninclude Rouses Point within the United States. As to _the convenience_\r\nof establishing the St. John and St. Francis as the northern boundary of\r\nMaine, we have only to observe that however \"convenient\" it may be to\r\nGreat Britain to obtain so large a portion of our territory and waters,\r\nit would certainly be very _inconvenient_ to us, and inasmuch as we are\r\nprobably capable of judging of our own \"convenience,\" and have never\r\nsolicited _the advice_ of anyone on this point, it is scarcely to be\r\nexpected that we shall be _advised_ to adopt a line so preposterous\r\nand injurious.\r\n\r\nIt was in this view and in strict conformity with the Constitution\r\nconferring the treaty power that the President on the 7th December,\r\n1831, submitted to the Senate this \"award\" and \"advice\" of the King\r\nof the Netherlands. Senators were divided on a principal point, some\r\ninsisting that to carry the award or opinion into effect was only _in\r\nexecution_ of the treaty, and it therefore belonged exclusively to the\r\nPresident \"to take care\" that this \"supreme law\" was faithfully executed\r\nor to reject it altogether.\r\n\r\nBut the prevailing opinion was that this \"award\" or \"advice\" was\r\n_perfecting an unfinished_ treaty, and that therefore it could not be\r\neffected by the President without \"the advice and consent of the Senate,\r\ntwo-thirds of the members present concurring therein.\" So far from the\r\nconcurrence of two-thirds _for_ the measure, there were _thirty-four_\r\nto _eight against_ it, and it was consequently rejected, and a\r\nrecommendation to the President was adopted to open a new negotiation\r\nto determine the line of boundary according to the treaty of 1783.\r\n\r\nIt is insisted by the British ministers that a due north line from the\r\nmonument at the source of the St. Croix will intersect no highlands\r\ndescribed in the treaty of 1783. Now this is an assumption by Great\r\nBritain totally unwarranted by any evidence. The boundaries bearing upon\r\nthe question are thus given: \"From the northwest angle of Nova Scotia,\r\nto wit, that angle which is formed by a line drawn due north from the\r\nsource of the St. Croix River to the highlands; along the said highlands\r\nwhich divide _the rivers_ that empty themselves into the St. Lawrence\r\nfrom those which fall into the Atlantic Ocean, to the north westernmost\r\nhead of Connecticut River\"; \"east by a line to be drawn along the middle\r\nof the river St. Croix from its mouth, in the Bay of Fundy, to its\r\nsource, and from its source directly north to the aforesaid highlands\r\nwhich divide the rivers that fall into the Atlantic Ocean from those\r\nwhich fall into the St. Lawrence.\"\r\n\r\nThe first object, starting place, or _terminus a quo_, is this\r\n_northwest angle of Nova Scotia_. It is the corner of the British\r\nProvince _designated by themselves_. It was presumed, and it is still\r\nbelieved, that they knew the identical spot; we have a right to demand\r\nof them to define it. In the treaty of 1783 they were disposed to define\r\nit, and hence they say it is _that angle which is formed by a line drawn\r\ndue north from the source of the St. Croix to those highlands which\r\ndivide the rivers that flow into the St. Lawrence from those which flow\r\ninto the Atlantic Ocean_.\r\n\r\nNothing can be more clear than that the British negotiators of the\r\ntreaty of 1783 had reference to their east and west line between Canada\r\nand Nova Scotia. This in 1755-56 was matter of controversy between\r\nFrance and England, the French claiming that it was far south and the\r\nBritish strenuously contending that these very highlands were even more\r\nnorth than we have endeavored to fix them.\r\n\r\nThe controversy resulted in a war, which, after the capture of Quebec,\r\nwas terminated by the peace of 1763, whereby Great Britain obtained both\r\nsides of the line, and she then established the north line of Nova\r\nScotia about where we contend it should be. So far from admitting that\r\na due north line from the monument will not intersect the highlands\r\nintended by the treaty of 1783, the State of Maine has always insisted,\r\nand still insists, that no known obstacle exists to the ascertaining and\r\naccurately defining them, and thus establishing the _terminus a quo, to\r\nwit, the northwest angle of Nova Scotia_. It would seem strange, indeed,\r\nthat this line, so fully discussed and controverted between the English\r\nand French in 1755-56, should have been left unsettled still when both\r\nProvinces became British. It is impossible to imagine such ignorance of\r\nso important a point as this northwest angle, so often referred to and\r\nspoken of as a notorious monument.\r\n\r\nThe peace of 1783 was considered by Great Britain as _a grant by metes\r\nand bounds_. The boundaries were prescribed, and this northwest angle\r\nwas _the commencement_. Twenty years only before this (1763) Nova Scotia\r\nhad been organized as a distinct Province, then including what are now\r\nNova Scotia and New Brunswick, and this angle was referred to as a\r\nboundary without hesitancy or doubt. Indeed, the treaty itself, as if\r\nto make assurance doubly sure, fixed it where a due north line from the\r\nsource of the St. Croix will intersect those highlands which divide\r\nthe rivers which flow into the _river_ St. Lawrence from those which\r\nflow into the Atlantic Ocean. This source of the St. Croix has been\r\ndetermined and a monument fixed there by the commissioners under the\r\nfifth article of the treaty of 1795 (Jay's). Now the assumption that the\r\nnorth line from this monument will intersect or meet no such highlands\r\nis entirely gratuitous.\r\n\r\nThe treaty does not speak of mountains nor even hills, but of\r\n\"highlands\" that divide rivers flowing different ways. It was well known\r\nthat rivers did fall into the St. Lawrence and into the Atlantic, that\r\nthese rivers would run _down_ and not _up_, and it was consequently\r\ninferred that the _land_ from whence these _rivers_ flowed must of\r\nnecessity be _high_, and unless there are to be found in that region\r\n_geological phenomena_ which exist nowhere else on the face of the globe\r\nthis inference is irresistible.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that these highlands have been known and well understood by\r\nthe British themselves ever since the grant of James I to Sir William\r\nAlexander, in 1621. The portion of the boundary there given which\r\nrelates to this controversy is \"from the western spring head of the St.\r\nCroix, by an imaginary line conceived to run through the land northward\r\nto the next road of Ships River or Spring discharging itself into the\r\ngreat river of Canada, and proceeding thence _eastward_ along the shores\r\nof the sea of the said river of Canada to the road, haven, or shore\r\ncommonly called _Gaspeck_\" (Gaspé).\r\n\r\nThe cession of Canada by France made it necessary to define the limits\r\nof the Province of Quebec, and accordingly His Britannic Majesty, by his\r\nproclamation of 7th October, 1763, is thus explicit as to what affects\r\nthis question: \"Passing along the highlands which divide _the rivers_\r\nthat empty themselves into the said _river_ St. Lawrence from those\r\nwhich fall into _the_ sea, and also _along the north coast of the Bay\r\nde Chaleurs_ and the coast of the _Gulf_ of the St. Lawrence to _Cape\r\nRosiers_\" etc.\r\n\r\nThe act of Parliament of the fourteenth George III (1774) defines thus\r\nthe south line of Canada: \"South by a line from the Bay de Chaleurs\r\nalong the highlands which divide the rivers that empty themselves into\r\nthe river St. Lawrence from those which flow into _the sea_.\" The north\r\nline of the grant to Alexander is from the source of the St. Croix to\r\nthe \"spring head\" or source of some river or stream which falls into\r\nthe river St. Lawrence, and thence _eastward_ to Gaspé Bay, which\r\ncommunicates with the Gulf of St. Lawrence in latitude 49° 30', and\r\nwould make nearly an east and west line. The proclamation of 1763\r\ndefines the _south_ line of the Province of Quebec as passing along the\r\nhighlands which divide the rivers that fall into the St. Lawrence from\r\nthose which fall into the sea, and also along the north coast of the\r\nBay de Chaleurs to _the Gulf_ of St. Lawrence. This is the _south_\r\nboundary, and consequently in an _east_ and _west direction_; but it\r\npasses _north_ of Bay de Chaleurs, wherefore the south boundary of the\r\nProvince must of necessity be north of Bay de Chaleurs. The eastern\r\nboundary is northerly by the Gulf of _Cape Rosiers_, in about latitude\r\n50°, longitude 64° north of Gaspé Bay, and at the mouth of the river\r\nSt. Lawrence, where it communicates with the gulf or sea. And the act\r\nof Parliament makes _this south side_ from this same bay along those\r\nhighlands, and it must _inevitably run west_ or _it is no south_\r\nboundary. Now no one can doubt that in the proclamation of 1763 it\r\nwas the intent to adopt Sir William Alexander's _northern_ for this\r\n_southern_ boundary of the Province of Quebec.\r\n\r\nIndeed, it appears in every commission to the governor of Nova Scotia\r\nand New Brunswick from 1763 to 1784, and after the treaty of peace of\r\n1783, that the Province of Nova Scotia extended to the southern boundary\r\nof the Province of Quebec. It then irresistibly and inevitably follows\r\nthat a west line from the Bay de Chaleurs, intersecting a due north line\r\nfrom the monument, is the identical northwest angle. Now a line from\r\nMars Hill direct to Cape Rosiers, instead of being _easterly_, would be\r\nnorth of northeast, _crossing_ the Bay de Chaleurs. But passing along\r\nits north coast, as the proclamation provides, the line from this Mars\r\nHill must be more northerly still. Indeed, the pretense that a pyramidal\r\nspur or peak, such as this hill, should constitute the range of\r\nhighlands mentioned in the treaty is so utterly visionary that it is\r\nentitled to _no sort of respect_.\r\n\r\nWe may now by these facts and reflections give this inquiry a right\r\ndirection, _to wit,_ to the ascertainment of the north boundary of Nova\r\nScotia, which is the southern boundary of Canada. We have always been\r\nlured from this by the British negotiators to the _left_ or _west_ of\r\nthis north line from the monument.\r\n\r\nNo one who is in the least conversant with the subject can suppose for a\r\nmoment that this northwest angle can be found in such a direction. The\r\nquestion for us is, Are there any highlands north of the Bay de Chaleurs\r\nextending _in a western direction toward_ a north line drawn from the\r\nmonument? If this line westerly from the bay be not distinctly marked so\r\nfar as to intersect this north line, the principle is to extend it in\r\nthe same direction to the place of intersection; that is, if the line\r\nbetween Nova Scotia and Canada is _west_ to within, say, 30 miles of the\r\nnorth line from the monument, and the rest of the way is indefinite or\r\nobscure, extend it on in the same direction until you form a point of\r\nintersection, and this will be the northwest angle of Nova Scotia. But\r\nthe truth is, _the highlands are there_, and have been found in running\r\ndue north from the monument. The elevations were taken by the British\r\nsurveyor from the source of the St. Croix, at the monument, to the first\r\nwaters of the Restigouche; and at Mars Hill, 40 miles, the summit of\r\nthis isolated sugar loaf was 1,100 feet, and at the termination of the\r\nsurvey at the Restigouche waters, 100 miles farther, the elevation was\r\nI,600 feet; consequently the summit of Mars Hill, 1,100 feet above the\r\nwaters of the St. Croix, is 500 feet lower than the lands at the\r\nRestigouche. And yet the pretense is that there are no highlands but\r\nthis detached spur, Mars Hill! Still further, the highest position\r\nsurveyed is nearly 50 miles short of the Melis, which falls into the St.\r\nLawrence, and we do not perceive that the elevations have been taken\r\nthere at all, but we do find it is here that _the waters separate_, and\r\nconsequently the land must be still higher.\r\n\r\nIn failure of highlands (_assumed_ not to exist), the British\r\nnegotiators claim a line which, instead of dividing the St. Lawrence\r\nand Atlantic waters, would actually extend between two rivers, _both\r\nof which fall into the Atlantic_.\r\n\r\nTo say nothing of the absurdity, not to say ignorance, of such a claim,\r\nit is enough that it is in the teeth of the treaty itself. It is painful\r\nto repeat the argument that no other highlands were intended, for all\r\nothers were expressly excluded but those which divide the waters that\r\nflow in those different directions. The effect of their construction,\r\nas we all know, is to give them the whole of the St. John, with all its\r\ntributaries, and a tract of territory south of that river equal at least\r\nto 75 miles square.\r\n\r\nWhether from the peaceful spirit of our Government, the Christian\r\npatience of Maine, or the \"modest assurance\" of the British\r\nnegotiators--any or all--certain it is that His Britannic Majesty's\r\npretensions _are growing every day_. It is not only an afterthought,\r\nbut one very recently conceived, that we were to be driven south of\r\nthe St. John.\r\n\r\nHis Britannic Majesty's agent, Mr. Chipman, who has been lately urging\r\nus south of that river, was also agent to the commission, under the\r\ntreaty of 1795, to ascertain the true St. Croix, and in insisting on\r\na more _western_ branch of this river gives as a reason that a line\r\ndue north will cross the St, John _farther up_, whereas if you take an\r\n_eastern_ branch such line will cross near Frederickton, the seat of\r\ngovernment of New Brunswick, and materially infringe upon His Majesty's\r\nProvince. He not only admits, but contends, that this north line _must_\r\ncross the river. Here are his words: \"This north line must of necessity\r\ncross the river St. John.\" Mr. Liston, the British minister, in a\r\nprivate letter to Mr. Chipman of 23d October, 1798, recommends a\r\nmodification of the powers of the commissioners for the reason that _it\r\nmight give Great Britain a greater extent of navigation on the St. John\r\nRiver_. The same agent, Mr. Chipman, was also agent under the fourth\r\narticle of the treaty of Ghent, and we find him contending there \"that\r\nthe northwest angle of Nova Scotia is the same designated in the grant\r\nto Sir William Alexander in 1621, subject only to such alterations as\r\nwere occasioned by the erection of the Province of Quebec in 1763.\" Now\r\nwe have already seen that this south line of the Province of Quebec, so\r\nfar from _altering_ this northwest angle, in fact confirms it.\r\n\r\nIn perfect accordance with this disposition to encroach is a proposition\r\nof the British minister (Mr. Vaughan) that inasmuch as the highlands can\r\nnot be found by a due north direction from the monument we should _vary\r\nwest_ until we should intersect them, _but not_ EAST. Now that in case a\r\nmonument can not be found in the course prescribed you should look for\r\nit _at the left, but not to the right_, seems to us a very _sinister_\r\nproposition. We have shown, and, as we think, conclusively, that the\r\nrange of highlands is to be looked for on British ground, and nowhere\r\nelse, because it is their own boundary, and a line which must, with an\r\nascertained north line, form the angle of one of their own Provinces.\r\nAnd yet we are not to examine there at all; we have never explored the\r\ncountry there, and are expected to yield to such arrogant, extravagant,\r\nand baseless pretensions!\r\n\r\nWe would ask why, in what justice, if we can not find the object\r\nin the route prescribed, are we to be thus trammeled? Where is the\r\n_reciprocity_ of such a proposition, so degrading to the dignity and\r\ninsulting to the rights and liberties of this State? No; the people of\r\nMaine will not now, and we trust they never will, tamely submit to such\r\na _one-sided_ measure.\r\n\r\nThe next restriction or limitation with which this negotiation is to be\r\nclogged is an admission that the Restigouche and St. John are not\r\nAtlantic rivers, because one flows into the Bay de Chaleurs and the\r\nother into the Bay of Fundy; yet neither falls into the river St.\r\nLawrence. They would then find those highlands between the St. John and\r\nthe Penobscot. There can not be a more arrogant pretension or palpable\r\nabsurdity. Suppose the waters of both these rivers are excluded as\r\nflowing _neither way_, still the waters that flow _each way_ are so far\r\nseparated as to leave a tract of country which, if equally divided,\r\nwould carry us far beyond the St. John. But we admit no such hypothesis.\r\nThe _Atlantic_ and the _sea_ are used in the charters as synonymous\r\nterms. The Restigouche, uniting with the Bay de Chaleurs, which\r\ncommunicates with the sea, and the St. John, uniting with the Bay of\r\nFundy, which also communicates with the sea, and that, too, by a mouth\r\n90 miles wide, are both Atlantic rivers. These rivers were known by the\r\nnegotiators not to be _St. Lawrence rivers;_ they were known to exist,\r\nfor they were rivers of the first class. If they were neither St.\r\nLawrence nor Atlantic, why were they not excepted? They were not of\r\nthe former, therefore they must be included in the latter description.\r\nIndeed, if rivers uniting with Atlantic bays are not Atlantic rivers,\r\nthe Penobscot and Kennebec, which unite with the respective bays of\r\nPenobscot and Sagadahock, would not be Atlantic rivers, and then where\r\nare those highlands which divide the waters referred to in the treaty\r\nof 1783? Should we leave this question unsettled a little longer, and\r\nthe British claims continue to increase, we might very soon find these\r\nhighlands south of the Connecticut, and all the intermediate country\r\nwould be _recolonized_ by \"construction.\" We therefore invoke the\r\nsympathy of all New England, with New York besides, to unite against\r\nthis progressive claim--this avalanche which threatens to overwhelm\r\n_them as well as ourselves_.\r\n\r\nAgain, if this Mars Hill (and we confess we can not speak of the\r\npretension with any patience) _is the northwest angle_, and the north\r\nboundary of Nova Scotia and the south boundary of the Province of Quebec\r\nare the same, and north of the Bay de Chaleurs, then there is indeed\r\n_no_ northwest angle, for a line due north from the monument, passing by\r\nMars Hill, must pursue nearly the same direction to get to the north of\r\nthat bay without crossing it; and who ever thought of an angle at the\r\nside of a continuous line? Now, according to the British maps taken in\r\nthis very case, you must run a course of north about 14° east to obtain\r\nthe north side of the bay without crossing it, and the distance would\r\nbe in this almost due north direction more than 100 miles, while that\r\nfrom the monument to Mars Hill would be little more than 40. Now when we\r\nconsider that this northerly line must form nearly a right angle to pass\r\nalong the north shore of the Bay de Chaleurs, that this is 100 miles\r\nfarther north than Mars Hill, where instead of an angle there can be\r\nonly an inclination of 14°, can there be a greater absurdity than the\r\nBritish claim founded on these facts?\r\n\r\nWe will now present some facts and remarks in regard to the surveys and\r\nexplorings made by the commission under the fifth article of the treaty\r\nof Ghent, and the first fact that occurs is that the elevations taken\r\nby the British surveyor stop far short of where the waters divide, and\r\nwe find no proof that these elevations were carried through by our own\r\nsurveyors. If the British surveyor, after ascertaining _he was still\r\nascending_ and had in fact arrived at the lands at _a branch of a river_\r\nelevated 500 feet above the summit of Mars Hill, _found it prudent to\r\nstop short_, we see no good reason why the American agent did _not\r\nproceed on_ and take accurate elevations at a place where the waters\r\ndivide. If such a survey was made, the committee have not been able to\r\nobtain the evidence. It is not in the maps or documents in the library\r\nor office of the Secretary of State, and the committee believe that no\r\nsuch elevations have been taken northerly of the first waters of the\r\nRestigouche. It is, indeed, a little singular that we have so little\r\nevidence, not only in regard to this height of land, but also of the\r\nrivers which flow into the St. Lawrence _to the left_, and _especially\r\nto the right_, of the north line from the monument.\r\n\r\nWe know some of them, to be sure, such as the _Oelle Kamouska, Verte,\r\nTrois Pistoles, Remouskey_, and _Metis_ on the left, and the _Blanche,\r\nLouis, Magdalen_, and others on the right of this line, but we know them\r\nchiefly as _on maps_ and as transcribed from older maps, but very little\r\nfrom actual survey or even exploration. An examination of the sources of\r\nthose rivers at the right of this north line, with the important natural\r\nboundary, the north shore of the Bay de Chaleurs, would accurately\r\ndefine the divisional line between the Province of Quebec and Nova\r\nScotia, which extending west would intersect the due north line and thus\r\nform the northwest angle of Nova Scotia.\r\n\r\nIt moreover appears that little or no exploration has been made of the\r\nlands _east_ of the due north line. It seems strange to us, although it\r\nmay be satisfactorily explained, why we should have been drawn away from\r\nthis very important region. It is, indeed, the true source of inquiry.\r\nIn this direction the evidence is to be found, and Maine can never be\r\nsatisfied until it is looked for here.\r\n\r\nAn extraordinary method of adjusting this question, though in\r\nperfect accordance with other pretensions, has been proposed by\r\nGreat Britain--that the disputed territory should be divided in equal\r\nportions, each party being satisfied of the justice of its claims.\r\nTo this proposition we can not subscribe. It is equally unjust between\r\nnations and individuals. Whether a party in controversy is satisfied\r\nor not with the justice of his claims is what is only known to himself,\r\nand consequently the one whose claims are most exorbitant, however\r\nunjust, will always get the best end of the bargain. But such a rule\r\nwould in this case apply most unfortunately to Maine. We are limited at\r\nfarthest to the St. Lawrence, and to a very narrow point there, while\r\nthe British may extend their claims to the south and west indefinitely.\r\nEstablish this principle and we shall soon find their claims, already\r\nso progressive, stretched over to the Piscataqua, and then if we are\r\nto divide equally both as to _quantity and quality_ the divisional line\r\nthen would fall south of the Kennebec. If the want of the consent of\r\nMaine is the obstacle to such an adjustment, we trust it will always\r\nremain an insuperable one. Indeed, we protest against the application\r\nto us of such a rule as manifestly unequal and unjust.\r\n\r\nWe come now to the recent transactions of the British colonial\r\nauthorities, sanctioned, as it appears, by the Government at home, and\r\nwe regret to perceive in them also those strong indications of continual\r\nand rapid encroachment which have characterized that Government in the\r\nwhole of this controversy. Mr. Livingston, in his letter of 21st July,\r\n1832, proposes that \"until the matter be brought to a final conclusion\r\nboth parties should refrain from the exercise of jurisdiction,\" and\r\nMr. Vaughan, in reply of 14th April, 1833, in behalf of his Government,\r\n\"entirely concurs.\" Here, then, the faith of the two Governments _is\r\npledged to_ abstain from acts of jurisdiction until all is settled. Now,\r\nhow are the facts? We understand, and indeed it appears by documents\r\nherewith exhibited, that an act has passed the legislature of New\r\nBrunswick \"incorporating the St. Andrews and Quebec Railroad Company,\"\r\nthat the King has granted, £10,000 to aid the enterprise, and that the\r\nlegislature of Lower Canada, by its resolutions of both houses, has\r\napproved the scheme and promised its cooperation. It may be that the\r\nGovernment at home was not aware that this railroad must inevitably\r\ncross the disputed territory.\r\n\r\nBut this ignorance of the subject seems incredible. A railroad from St.\r\nAndrews to Quebec would be _impossible_ unless it crossed the territory\r\nin question, even next to impossible and totally useless were it to pass\r\nat the north of the St. John. It seems, therefore, extraordinary indeed\r\nthat the British Government, even in the incipient stages of this\r\nenterprise, should make an appropriation which is in direct violation\r\nof its solemn pledge. To give to a railroad corporation powers over our\r\nrights and property is the strongest act of sovereignty. It is an act of\r\ndelegated power which we ourselves give to our own citizens with extreme\r\ncaution and with guarded restrictions and reservations. This railroad\r\n_must_ not only cross the disputed territory, but it crosses it 50 miles\r\nsouth of the St. John and almost to the southerly extremity of the\r\nBritish claim, extravagant as it is. By the map herewith exhibited of\r\nthe survey of the route it appears that the road crosses our due north\r\nline at Mars Hill, thence doubling round it toward the south it crosses\r\nthe _Roostic_ between the Great and Little _Machias_, the _Allegwash_\r\nat the outlet of _First Lake_, a branch of the St. John south of _Black\r\nRiver_, and passes into Canada between \"Spruce Hills\" on the right and\r\n\"Three Hills\" on the left, thus crossing a tract of country south of the\r\nSt. John 100 by 50 miles. We have not a copy of the act of incorporation\r\nof New Brunswick, and can not, therefore, say that the route there\r\ndefined is the same as on the map. Be this as it may, certain it is, as\r\nanyone will see, that no possible route can be devised which will not\r\ncross the territory in question. It is, then, a deliberate act of power,\r\npalpable and direct, claiming and exercising sovereignty far south even\r\nof the line recommended by the King of the Netherlands.\r\n\r\nIn all our inquiries and examinations of this subject there has been\r\ngreat negligence in regard to this northwest angle. Judge Benson, one of\r\nthe commissioners under Jay's treaty, in a letter to the President of\r\nthe United States expressly and clearly defines this angle. He states\r\ndistinctly that the due north line from the source of the St. Croix is\r\n_the west-side line_, and the highlands are _the north-side line_ which\r\nform this angle, and this had never been questioned by the British\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nThis due north line, viz, the west-side line, was established by the\r\ncommission of which Judge Benson was a member, and the British have made\r\nthe north side line to be north of the Bay de Chaleurs, and yet with\r\nthese postulates to pretend that the points of intersection can not be\r\nfound is one of the greatest of their absurdities; and another absurdity\r\nquite equal is that after passing west along the north shore of this\r\nbay they would fall down nearly south more than 100 miles to Mars Hill,\r\nabout 60 miles from the south shore of the Province, at the Bay of\r\nPassamaquoddy, which is part of the Bay of Fundy, and this point, too,\r\nof so little inclination that it is a palpable perversion of language\r\nto call it _an angle_, much more a northwest angle.\r\n\r\nIt is, indeed, time for us to begin to search, and in the right places,\r\ntoo, in order to put a stop to these perpetual encroachments upon our\r\nterritory and rights. Our first object should be to ascertain and trace\r\nthe north boundary of Nova Scotia, which is the south boundary of the\r\nProvince of Quebec, and see if Canada comes as far down as Mars Hill.\r\nAnd we should proceed to finish taking the elevations on the due north\r\nline to some point where the waters divide. The General Government\r\nshould be immediately called on to execute the work, with the\r\ncooperation of Massachusetts and Maine. Notice should be given to the\r\nBritish authorities to unite in the undertaking, and if they refuse\r\nour Government ought to proceed _ex parte_. The act would be entirely\r\npacific, as the object would be _to ascertain facts_--much more pacific\r\nthan the survey, _without notice_, of the St. Andrews and Quebec\r\nRailroad through our territory, not for the purpose of ascertaining\r\na boundary, but to assume jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nYour committee have gone through this tedious investigation with all the\r\ndeliberation, exactness, and candor which our time, means, and feelings\r\nwould allow. Our animadversions may in some instances have been strong,\r\nand even severe, but we think we have expressed the sentiments and\r\nfeelings of the people of Maine, suffering under protracted injuries.\r\nThis State should take a firm, deliberate, and dignified stand, and one\r\nwhich it will not retract. While it awards to the General Government\r\nall its legitimate powers, it will not be forgetful of its own. We call\r\nupon the President and Congress. We invoke that aid and sympathy of our\r\nsister States which Maine has always accorded to them. We ask, nay we\r\ndemand, in the name of justice, HOW LONG we are to be thus trampled down\r\nby a foreign people? And we trust we shall meet a cordial and patriotic\r\nresponse in the heart of every republican of the Union.\r\n\r\nYour committee therefore submit the following resolutions:\r\n\r\nSTATE OF MAINE.\r\n\r\nRESOLVES relative to the northeastern boundary.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That we view with much solicitude the British usurpations\r\nand encroachments on the northeastern part of the territory of this\r\nState.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That pretensions so groundless and extravagant indicate a\r\nspirit of hostility which we had no reason to expect from a nation with\r\nwhom we are at peace.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That vigilance, resolution, firmness, and union on the part\r\nof this State are necessary in this state of the controversy.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That the governor be authorized and requested to call on the\r\nPresident of the United States to cause the northeastern boundary of\r\nthis State to be explored and surveyed and monuments erected according\r\nto the _treaty_ of 1783.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That the cooperation of Massachusetts be requested.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That our Senators in Congress be _instructed_ and our\r\nRepresentatives _requested_ to endeavor to obtain a _speedy_ adjustment\r\nof the controversy.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That copies of this report and resolution be transmitted to\r\nthe governor of Massachusetts, the President of the United States, to\r\neach of our Senators and Representatives in Congress, and other Senators\r\nin Congress, and the governors of the several States.\r\n\r\n[Passed house March 24, 1837; passed Senate and approved March 25, 1837.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATE OF MAINE, EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT,\r\n\r\n_Augusta, June 27, 1837_.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency MARTIN VAN BUREN,\r\n\r\n_President of the United States_.\r\n\r\nSIR: I lose no time in communicating to Your Excellency a copy of a\r\nletter from Sir John Harvey, lieutenant-governor of the Province of New\r\nBrunswick, and also of a letter from J.A. Maclauchlan to Sir John\r\nHarvey, in relation to the arrest and imprisonment of Ebenezer S.\r\nGreely.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with high consideration, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nROBERT P. DUNLAP.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT HOUSE,\r\n\r\n_Frederickton, New Brunswick, June 12, 1837_\r\n\r\nHis Excellency the GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF MAINE.\r\n\r\nSIR: Since I had the honor of addressing your excellency under date the\r\n6th instant, announcing my assumption of the administration of this\r\ngovernment, a report has been laid before me by the warden of the\r\ndisputed territory, copy of which I feel it to be an act of courtesy\r\ntoward your excellency to lose no time in communicating to you.\r\n\r\nIn including the territory within the limits of the British claim in the\r\ncensus which \"Ebenezer Greely\"' appears to have been instructed to take\r\nof the population of the county of \"Penobscot\" he has evidently acted in\r\nignorance or under a misconception of the subsisting relations betwixt\r\nEngland and the United States of America, which I can not allow myself\r\nto doubt that your excellency will lose no time in causing to be\r\nexplained and removed. Though necessarily committed to confinement,\r\nI have desired that every regard may be shown to Greely's personal\r\nconvenience consistent with the position in which he has _voluntarily_\r\nplaced himself. I use this expression because, as your excellency will\r\nobserve, Greely was informed by the warden that if he would desist from\r\nthe act in which he was engaged and the language which he was holding\r\nto the people of the Madawaska settlement (acts constituting not only\r\nan interference with the acknowledged rights of jurisdiction of this\r\nProvince, but the positive exercise within its limits of actual\r\njurisdiction, however unauthorized on the part of the State of Maine)\r\nand would withdraw from this district he should be allowed to do so;\r\notherwise that in the discharge of the duties imposed upon him by his\r\noffice he (the warden), who is in the commission of the peace, must\r\nbe under the necessity of apprehending, in order to make him amenable\r\nto the laws of the Province. This proposal Greely rejected, and was\r\naccordingly committed to jail to be dealt with according to law. In the\r\nmeantime, as an evidence of my desire to cultivate the most friendly\r\nunderstanding with the government of the State of which Greely is a\r\ncitizen, I lose no time in saying that upon receiving an assurance from\r\nyour excellency that your authority shall be exerted in restraining this\r\nor any other citizen of the State of Maine from adopting proceedings\r\nwithin the British limits (as claimed) calculated to infringe the\r\nauthority and jurisdiction of this Province and to disturb and unsettle\r\nthe minds of that portion of its inhabitants residing in the disputed\r\nterritories until the question in dispute be brought to a final\r\nsettlement Greely shall immediately be enlarged.\r\n\r\nTrusting that your excellency will see in this proposition an anxious\r\ndesire on my part to redeem the pledge given in my communication of the\r\n6th instant, I have the honor to be, your excellency's most obedient,\r\nhumble servant,\r\n\r\nJ. HARVEY,\r\n\r\n_Major-General, Lieutenant-Governor, etc_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFREDERICKTON, NEW BRUNSWICK, _June 10, 1837_.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency Major-General SIR JOHN HARVEY, K.C.H.,\r\n\r\n_Lieutenant-Governor, etc._:\r\n\r\nMay it please your excellency: In obedience to your excellency's\r\ninstructions, communicated to me through the advocate-general in the\r\nabsence of the attorney and solicitor generals, I have now the honor to\r\nreport for the information of your excellency that I proceeded with the\r\nleast possible delay to the Madawaska settlement. On my arrival at the\r\nGreat Falls, 130 miles from hence, I was informed the American citizen\r\nEbenezer S. Greely had passed up the day previous for the purpose of\r\nagain proceeding with the census of the inhabitants of Madawaska under\r\nauthority from the State of Maine. Aware of the probable excitement\r\nthat would naturally arise between the two governments from this\r\ncircumstance, and at the same time fully convinced that His Majesty's\r\nGovernment would but regret any unnecessary misunderstanding during the\r\npending negotiation, I thought it advisable to call upon Mr. Coombs,\r\na magistrate residing 12 miles above the Falls, and request him to\r\naccompany me, which he readily did, to witness the conversation between\r\nMr. Greely and myself.\r\n\r\nWe then proceeded and overtook Mr. Greely a short distance above\r\nGreen River, about 24 miles from the Falls, having ascertained by the\r\ninhabitants, as he passed up the river, that Mr. Greely was the whole\r\nof the previous day employed in taking down their names, number of each\r\nfamily, and stating they would shortly receive from the State of Maine a\r\nsum of money not exceeding $3 for each head of family out of the surplus\r\nrevenue of the United States.\r\n\r\nI required Mr. Greely to show me his instructions for exercising\r\nauthority in Madawaska, when he handed me a document, a copy of which\r\nI beg to inclose your excellency, and after perusing the same I returned\r\nit with my opinion that I really thought he (Mr. Greely) had mistaken\r\nthe intention of his instructions, as no allusion was made either to\r\nthat settlement or the territory in dispute, and therefore if he would\r\nthen desist in taking the census I would take no notice of what had\r\npassed. Moreover, in reply to my advice and request, he (Mr. Greely)\r\nremonstrated and attempted to make it appear that he would be fully\r\nborne out by his government in what he had done, and it was also his\r\nintention to complete the census if he was not prevented; this reply\r\nI regret having left me no alternative but to make him a prisoner, which\r\nI did on Wednesday, the 7th instant. On Friday evening I arrived in\r\nFrederickton, and this morning (Saturday), by the advice of the\r\nadvocate-generals, I committed him to the gaol of the county of York.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, your excellency's most obedient, humble servant,\r\n\r\nJ.A. MACLAUCHLAN,\r\n\r\n_Warden of the Disputed Territory_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATE OF MAINE, EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT,\r\n\r\n_JUNE 19, 1837_.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency MARTIN VAN BUREN,\r\n\r\n_President of the United States_.\r\n\r\nSIR: I have the honor to inclose to Your Excellency the copy of a letter\r\nwhich came to hand by the last mail, by which it appears that Ebenezer\r\nS. Greely, esq., the agent employed by the county commissioners for the\r\ncounty of Penobscot to take the census of the town of Madawaska, has\r\nbeen arrested by the authorities of the Province of New Brunswick and is\r\nnow incarcerated in the jail at Frederickton.\r\n\r\nIn this state of things it becomes my painful duty to make this\r\ncommunication to Your Excellency and to insist that prompt measures\r\nbe adopted by the Government of the United States to effect the early\r\nrelease of the aforementioned citizen.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great respect, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nROBERT P. DUNLAP.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFREDERICKTON, PROVINCE OF NEW BRUNSWICK,\r\n\r\n_June 12, 1837_.\r\n\r\nROBERT P. DUNLAP, Esq.,\r\n\r\n_Governor of Maine_.\r\n\r\nSIR: On the 15th of May last I was appointed by the county\r\ncommissioners of Penobscot County to take the census of Madawaska. On\r\nthe 6th of June instant I was arrested by Mr. Maclauchlan, from this\r\nplace, and committed to jail by him, and there I now remain--in the\r\nprison at Frederickton. I was committed on the 10th instant. I addressed\r\na letter to you on the 10th, which has gone by the way of St. Andrews.\r\nFearing that letter will not arrive soon, I write again to-day by way\r\nof Houlton. I have described my arrest more particularly in my first\r\nletter, which you will undoubtedly receive before long; therefore I\r\nonly give the facts in this, having a chance, by the assistance of\r\nMr. Lombard, of Hallowell, of forwarding this to Houlton privately.\r\nI was employed in business of the State, and do expect my Government\r\nwill intercede and liberate me from prison in a foreign and adjacent\r\nProvince. I shall be pleased to receive a line from you expressing your\r\nopinion, direction, etc.\r\n\r\nI remain, sir, respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nEBRN'R S. GREELY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE,\r\n\r\n_Washington, June 26, 1837_.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency ROBERT P. DUNLAP, Esq.,\r\n\r\n_Governor of Maine_.\r\n\r\nSIR: I have the honor, by direction of the President, to acknowledge the\r\nreceipt of your letter to him of the 19th instant, inclosing the copy of\r\na communication dated the 12th of the same month addressed to you by\r\nEbenezer S. Greely, esq., the agent employed by the county commissioners\r\nfor the county of Penobscot to take the census of the town of Madawaska,\r\nfrom which it appears that he has been arrested by the authorities of\r\nthe Province of New Brunswick and is now in confinement in the jail at\r\nFrederickton, and insisting that prompt measures be adopted by the\r\nGovernment of the United States to effect the early release of the\r\nabove-named citizen.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances attending this outrage as given in Mr. Greely's\r\nletter are not sufficient, in the view of the President, to warrant\r\nthe interference of the Government at present. For what cause, at\r\nwhat place, and by what authority the arrest was made is not stated.\r\nThe necessary explanations may be found, perhaps, in the previous\r\ncommunication which Mr. Greely refers to as having been addressed to you\r\nby him on the 10th June; if not, it is probable that you will easily be\r\nable to obtain explicit information from other sources and communicate\r\nit to this Department. It is indispensable that a full knowledge of\r\nall the facts illustrative of the case should be in possession of the\r\nGovernment before any formal application for redress can be properly\r\npreferred.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime I have in conversation unofficially called the\r\nattention of Mr. Fox, the British minister at Washington, to this\r\ncomplaint, and he has given me an assurance that he will immediately\r\naddress a representation on the subject to the governor of New Brunswick\r\nrequesting, unless there shall be some very extraordinary reasons\r\nagainst it, that Mr. Greely may be set at liberty.\r\n\r\nI am, sir, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nJOHN FORSYTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATE OF MAINE, EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT,\r\n\r\n_Augusta, June 27, 1837_.\r\n\r\nHon. JOHN FORSYTH,\r\n\r\n_Secretary of State of the United States_.\r\n\r\nSIR: I would respectfully solicit copies of all documents and papers\r\nin the Department of State of the United States in relation to the\r\nsubject of the northeastern boundary, with the exception of such as were\r\nfurnished this department by the General Government in the year 1827. It\r\nis understood that copies have been furnished relative to this subject\r\ndown to the respective statements submitted by the two Governments to\r\nthe King of the Netherlands, but the arguments we have not been\r\nfurnished with.\r\n\r\nI am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nROBERT P. DUNLAP.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATE OF MAINE, EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT,\r\n\r\n_July 3, 1837_.\r\n\r\nHon. JOHN FORSYTE,\r\n\r\n_Secretary of State of United States_.\r\n\r\nSIR: I have had the honor to receive yours of the 26th of June last,\r\nin which, by direction of the President, you indicate that the\r\ncircumstances detailed in Mr. Greely's letter relative to his arrest\r\nand imprisonment are not of themselves without further explanation\r\nsufficient to justify the interference of the Government of the United\r\nStates. This information is received with some surprise and much\r\nregret--surprise because I had understood Mr. Greely's communication to\r\nshow that while employed within the limits of this State and under its\r\nauthority on a business intrusted to him by the laws of the State he\r\nwas, without being charged or suspected of any other offense, seized and\r\ntransported to a foreign jail; regret inasmuch as the feelings of the\r\npeople of this State have been strongly excited by this outrage upon the\r\nhonor and sovereignty of Maine, and each additional day's confinement\r\nwhich that unoffending citizen endures is adding to the indignation of\r\nour citizens. I therefore hasten to lay before you a summary of the\r\ntransactions connected with this subject as they are gathered from\r\nMr. Greely's communications to this department. The facts are to be\r\nconsidered the less indisputable because they are in the main confirmed\r\nby the statements contained in the letter of the lieutenant-governor of\r\nthe Province of New Brunswick, by whose order the imprisonment was made,\r\nand a copy of which I recently had the honor of transmitting to the\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th day of March last the legislature of this State passed an act\r\nrelative to the surplus revenue, a copy of which is inclosed,[2] to the\r\neleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth sections of which I beg leave to refer\r\nyour attention. An additional act was passed on the 29th day of March\r\nlast, a copy of which I also inclose.[2] By this last-named act it\r\nbecame the duty of the county commissioners of Penobscot County to cause\r\nan enumeration to be taken of the inhabitants of said county residing\r\nnorth of the surveyed and located townships. The tract thus defined\r\ncomprised the town of Madawaska, which was incorporated by this State\r\non the 15th of March, 1831. Pursuant to that requirement, the county\r\ncommissioners of said county appointed Ebenezer S. Greely to perform\r\nthat service, and, being duly commissioned, he forthwith proceeded to\r\nthe place designated and entered upon the required operations. Being\r\nthus employed, he was on the 29th day of May last arrested by the\r\nauthorities of the Province of New Brunswick and conveyed to Woodstock,\r\nin the county of Carleton, in said Province, but the sheriff of the\r\ncounty refused to commit him to jail, and he was accordingly discharged.\r\nHe immediately returned to the Madawaska settlements to enter again upon\r\nthe duty intrusted to him. On the 6th day of June last he was arrested\r\na second time by the same authorities and committed to the jail at\r\nFrederickton. It is for this act of obedience to the laws of his\r\ngovernment that Mr. Greely now lies incarcerated in a public jail in the\r\nProvince of New Brunswick. Is not redress urgently called for? Must not\r\nthis unoffending citizen be immediately released?\r\n\r\nPermit me, sir, to add my confident belief that the President on this\r\npresentation of the facts relative to this outrage upon the national as\r\nwell as the State rights will not fail to demand the immediate release\r\nof Ebenezer S. Greely and to interpose suitable claims of indemnity for\r\nthe wrongs so wantonly enforced upon him.\r\n\r\nI am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nROBERT P. DUNLAP.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Omitted.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE,\r\n\r\n_Washington, July 14, 1837_.\r\n\r\nHon. ROBERT P. DUNLAP,\r\n\r\n_Governor of the State of Maine_.\r\n\r\nSIR: Your letter of the 3d instant has been received. The surprise you\r\nexpress that the information contained in the letter of Mr. Greely which\r\naccompanied your former communication was not considered sufficient\r\nto enable the President to make a formal application to the British\r\nGovernment for his release has probably arisen from your not having\r\nadverted particularly to the defects of his statement. It was not\r\nexpressly mentioned for what offense the arrest was made nor where it\r\ntook place--upon the territory in dispute between the United States and\r\nGreat Britain or beyond it. The character of the charge and the place at\r\nwhich the offense was committed might have been inferred from what was\r\nstated, but you must perceive the impropriety of a formal complaint\r\nfrom one government to another founded upon inference when the means of\r\nascertaining and presenting the facts distinctly were within the power\r\nof the party complaining; but although this Department felt itself\r\nconstrained by these considerations to delay a formal application to\r\nthe British Government for the release of Mr. Greely, it lost no time,\r\nas has been already stated, in procuring the interference to that\r\nend of the British minister near this Government; and I have now the\r\nsatisfaction to inform you that I have learnt from him that he has\r\nopened a correspondence with the lieutenant-governor of New Brunswick,\r\nwhich it is expected will lead to the release of Greely from confinement\r\nwithout waiting for the decision of His Britannic Majesty's Government\r\non the whole question.\r\n\r\nThe information communicated to the Department since the receipt of\r\nyour letter of the 3d instant is sufficiently explicit, and a note\r\nfounded upon it has been, by direction of the President, addressed to\r\nMr. Stevenson, instructing him to demand the immediate liberation of\r\nMr. Greely and indemnity for his imprisonment.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, sir, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nJOHN FORSYTH.\r\n\r\nP.S.--The papers asked for in your letter of the 27th ultimo will be\r\nsent to you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE,\r\n\r\n_Washington, July 19, 1837_.\r\n\r\nHon. ROBERT P. DUNLAP,\r\n\r\n_Governor of Maine_.\r\n\r\nSIR: In compliance with the request contained in your letter of the\r\n27th ultimo, I have the honor to transmit to you a printed volume\r\ncontaining a statement on the part of the United States of the case\r\nreferred, in pursuance of the convention of the 29th September, 1827,\r\nbetween the said States and Great Britain to the King of the Netherlands\r\nfor his decision thereon, and to refer you for such other papers and\r\ndocuments in relation to the northeastern boundary as have not been\r\nspecially furnished by this Department to the executive of Maine to the\r\nfollowing numbers in the volumes of documents of the Senate and House\r\nof Representatives distributed under a resolution of Congress, and\r\nwhich have been from time to time transmitted to the several State\r\ngovernments, including that of Maine:\r\n\r\nDocuments of the House of Representatives: First session Twentieth\r\nCongress, Nos. 217, 218; second session Twentieth Congress, No. 90;\r\nsecond session Twenty-third Congress, No. 62. Documents of the Senate:\r\nFirst session Twenty-fourth Congress, No. 414.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, sir, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nJOHN FORSYTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATE OF MAINE, EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT,\r\n\r\n_July 28, 1837_.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency MARTIN VAN BUREN,\r\n\r\n_President of the United States_.\r\n\r\nSIR: Impelled by a sense of duty arising from the oversight committed to\r\nme of the rights and interests of this State, I beg leave to invite the\r\nattention of Your Excellency to the subject of the northeastern boundary\r\nof Maine. By the federal compact the obligation of defending each State\r\nagainst foreign invasion and of protecting it in the exercise of its\r\njurisdictional rights up to its extreme line of boundary is devolved\r\nupon the National Government. Permit me respectfully to inform the\r\nPresident that in the opinion of the people of Maine the justice due\r\nto this State in this respect has not been rendered.\r\n\r\nLet it not be suspected that the discontents which are moving strongly\r\nand deeply through the public mind flow from any deficiency of\r\nattachment or practical adhesion to our National Government. Without\r\nappealing to the blood so freely poured out in war by the citizens of\r\nMaine, to the privations so cheerfully endured while the restrictive\r\nmeasures of the Government were prostrating the most important interests\r\nof this commercial people, or to the support of the Union so cordially\r\ngiven through every vicissitude up to the present hour, such a\r\nsuspicion, if it could arise, would be sufficiently refuted by merely\r\nadverting to the forbearance with which they have so long endured the\r\naggressions by a foreign government upon their sovereignty, their\r\ncitizens, and their soil.\r\n\r\nIt would be easy to prove that the territory of Maine extends to the\r\nhighlands north of the St. John; but that point, having been not only\r\nadmitted, but successful; demonstrated, by the Federal Government,\r\nneeds not now to be discussed. Candor, however, requires me to say that\r\nthis conceded and undeniable position ill accords with the proceedings\r\nin which the British authorities have for many years been indulged, and\r\nby which the rightful jurisdiction of Maine has been subverted, her\r\nlands ravaged of their most valuable products, and her citizens dragged\r\nbeyond the limits of the State to undergo the sufferings and ignominies\r\nof a foreign jail. These outrages have been made known to the Federal\r\nGovernment; they have been the subject of repeated remonstrances by the\r\nState, and these remonstrances seem as often to have been contemned. It\r\ncan not be deemed irrelevant for me here to ask, amid all these various\r\nimpositions, and while Maine has been vigorously employed in sustaining\r\nthe Union and in training her children to the same high standard of\r\ndevotion to the political institutions of the country, what relief has\r\nbeen brought to us by the Federal Government. The invaders have not been\r\nexpelled. The sovereignty and soil of the State are yet stained by the\r\nhostile machinations of resident emissaries of a foreign government. The\r\nterritory and the jurisdiction of 6,000,000 acres, our title to which\r\nthe Government of the United States has pronounced to be perfect, have,\r\nwithout the knowledge of Maine, been once put entirely at hazard. Grave\r\ndiscussions, treaty arrangements, and sovereign arbitration have been\r\nresorted to, in which Maine was not permitted to speak, and they have\r\nresulted not in removing the fictitious pretensions, but in supplying\r\nnew encouragements to the aggressors. Diplomatic ingenuity, the only\r\nfoundation of the British claim, has been arrayed against the perfect\r\nright. In the meantime a stipulation made by the Executive of the\r\nnation, without the knowledge of Maine, purported to preclude her\r\nfrom reclaiming her rightful jurisdiction until the slow process of a\r\nnegotiation should be brought to a close. Whatever the real force of\r\nthat stipulation might be, made as it was without the concurrence of the\r\ntwo branches of the treaty-making power, it was hoped when it expired\r\nby the closing up of that negotiation that a measure fraught with such\r\nhurtful consequences to Maine would not again be attempted; but that\r\nhope was to be disappointed, and now, by a compact of similar character,\r\na writ of protection appears to have been spread by our own Government\r\nover the whole mass of British aggressions. What, then, has the Federal\r\nGovernment done for this State? May it not be said, in the language of\r\nanother, \"Maine has not been treated as she endeavored to deserve\"?\r\n\r\nOn the 22d day of April last I had the honor to transmit to Your\r\nExcellency certain resolves passed by the legislature of this State\r\nrelative to the northeastern boundary, and in behalf of the State to\r\ncall upon the President of the United States to cause the line to be\r\nexplored and surveyed and monuments thereof erected. That this call,\r\nmade by direction of the legislature, did not extend to the expulsion\r\nof invaders, but merely to the ascertainment of the treaty line, will,\r\nI trust, be viewed as it was designed to be, not only as an evidence\r\nof the continued forbearance of Maine, but as a testimonial of the\r\nconfidence she cherished that the Federal Executive would protect\r\nthe territory after its limitation should be ascertained. That this\r\napplication would meet with favor from the Federal Executive was\r\nexpected, more especially as Congress had made a specific appropriation\r\nfor the purpose. I will not attempt to conceal the mortification I have\r\nrealized that no reply has been made to that communication nor any\r\nmeasures taken, so far as my information extends, for effecting the\r\nobject proposed.\r\n\r\nIt now remains that in the exercise of that faithfulness for which\r\nI stand solemnly pledged to the people of Maine I should again commend\r\nto the attention of the National Executive this apparently unwelcome but\r\nreally important subject.\r\n\r\nI have, therefore, the honor again to request that the President will\r\ncause the treaty line upon the northeastern limits of Maine to be run\r\nand marked, and I can not but hope that on a reexamination of the\r\nsubject Your Excellency will concur with this State in relation to the\r\nrightfulness and the necessity of the measure proposed, as well as to\r\nall the remedies to be adopted for restoring to Maine the invaluable\r\nrights from which she has so long been debarred.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with high consideration, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nROBERT P. DUNLAP.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE,\r\n\r\n_Washington, August 17, 1837_.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency ROBERT P. DUNLAP,\r\n\r\n_Governor of the State of Maine_.\r\n\r\nSIR: Your letter of the 28th ultimo to the President was duly received.\r\nIt has been referred to this Department with instructions to make a\r\nsuitable reply.\r\n\r\nYour excellency is of opinion that the Federal Government has for a\r\nseries of years failed to protect the State of Maine in the exercise of\r\nher jurisdictional rights to the extent of her boundary, and complains\r\nthat these rights have been in consequence thereof subverted, the lands\r\nof the State ravaged of their most valuable productions, and her\r\ncitizens subjected to imprisonment in a foreign jail. Your excellency\r\nparticularly objects to the course of the Federal Government for having,\r\nwithout the knowledge of the State, put entirely at hazard the title of\r\nMaine, admitted by the Government of the United States to be perfect,\r\nto the territory in question by the resort to diplomatic discussions,\r\ntreaty arrangements, and foreign arbitration in which Maine was not\r\npermitted to speak; for having entered into a stipulation without her\r\nconsent purporting to preclude the State from retaining her rightful\r\njurisdiction pending a negotiation, and for the continuance of it\r\nafter that negotiation was supposed to have been concluded, and for\r\nan omission on the part of the Executive of the United States to comply\r\nwith an application of the State made through her legislature to\r\nhave the boundary line between Maine and the British North American\r\npossessions explored, surveyed, and monuments erected thereon in\r\npursuance of the authority conferred on the President by Congress and\r\nof a request made by your excellency, which is now renewed.\r\n\r\nThe views which your excellency has been pleased to take of the subject\r\nat this time embrace measures some of which have long since ceased to be\r\noperative and reach back to the propriety of the stipulations entered\r\ninto by the treaty of Ghent, also of the subsequent negotiation designed\r\nto bring those stipulations to a satisfactory result in the mode\r\nprescribed by that treaty--that of arbitrament. It being, as your\r\nexcellency states, the opinion of Maine that those proceedings were\r\nunjust and unwise, it is, in a matter in which she is so deeply\r\ninterested, her undoubted right to say so; yet the President thinks\r\nthat he can not be mistaken in believing that no practical good can at\r\nthis time be expected from discussion between the Federal and State\r\nGovernments upon those points. That the measures referred to have not\r\nbeen as fortunate in their results as was hoped is entirely true, but\r\nyour excellency may nevertheless be assured that they had their origin\r\nin a sincere desire on the part of the Federal Government to discharge\r\nall its duties toward the State of Maine as a member of the Union, and\r\nwere resorted to in the full belief that her just rights would be\r\npromoted by their adoption.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the restrictions imposed upon Maine in reclaiming her\r\nrightful jurisdiction your excellency doubtlessly refers to the\r\nunderstanding between the Federal Government and that of Great Britain\r\nthat each party should abstain from the exercise of jurisdiction over\r\nthe disputed territory during the pendency of negotiation. Unless it\r\nbe correct to say that the controversy was one that did not admit of\r\nnegotiation, and that the duty of the Federal Government consisted only\r\nin an immediate resort to maintain the construction put by itself upon\r\nits own rights and those of the State of Maine, there would seem to\r\nbe no reasonable objection to such an arrangement as that alluded to,\r\nwhether it be viewed in respect to the interests or the pacific and just\r\ncharacters of the respective Governments. That this arrangement was\r\nnot abrogated at the period at which your excellency is understood to\r\nsuppose that it ought to have been done, viz, upon the failure of a\r\nsettlement of the controversy by arbitration, is explained by events of\r\nsubsequent occurrence. When the award of the arbitrator was submitted by\r\nthe late President to the Senate of the United States, that body refused\r\nits advice and consent to the execution of the award, and passed a\r\nresolution recommending to him to open a new negotiation with Great\r\nBritain for the ascertainment of the boundary according to the treaty\r\nof peace of 1783. That negotiation was forthwith entered upon by the\r\nExecutive, is still pending, and has been prosecuted with unremitting\r\nassiduity. It is under such circumstances that the Federal Executive has\r\ndecided upon a continued compliance with the arrangement referred to,\r\nand has insisted also upon its observance on the part of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nConsiderations of a similar nature have induced the President to refrain\r\nhitherto from exercising the discretionary authority with which he is\r\ninvested to cause the boundary line in dispute to be explored, surveyed,\r\nand monuments to be erected thereon. Coinciding with the government of\r\nMaine on the question of the true boundary between the British Provinces\r\nand the State, the President is yet bound by duty to consider the claim\r\nwhich has been set up by a foreign power in amity with the United States\r\nand the circumstances under which the negotiation for the adjustment\r\nof that claim has been transmitted to him. It could not be useful\r\nto examine the foundation of the British claim in a letter to your\r\nexcellency. Respect for the authorities of a friendly nation compels us\r\nto admit that they have persuaded themselves that their claim is justly\r\ngrounded. However that may be, the present President of the United\r\nStates upon entering on the discharge of the duties of his office found\r\nthat a distinct proposition had been made by his predecessor for the\r\npurpose of amicably settling this long-disputed controversy, to which no\r\nanswer has yet been received. Under such circumstances the President was\r\nnot able to satisfy himself, however anxious to gratify the people and\r\nthe legislature of Maine, that a step like that recommended by them\r\ncould be usefully or properly taken.\r\n\r\nThe clause containing the specific appropriation made by the last\r\nCongress for exploring, surveying, and marking certain portions of the\r\nnortheastern boundary of the United States, to which your excellency\r\nalludes, is by no means imperative in its character. The simple\r\nlegislative act of placing a sum of money under the control of the\r\nExecutive for a designated object is not understood to be a direction\r\nthat it must in any event be immediately applied to the prosecution of\r\nthat object. On the contrary, so far from implying that the end in view\r\nis to be attained at all hazards, it is believed that it merely vests a\r\ndiscretionary power in the President to carry out the views of Congress\r\non his own responsibility should contingencies arise to render expedient\r\nthe proposed expenditure.\r\n\r\nUnder existing circumstances the President deems it proper to wait for\r\nthe definitive answer of the British Government to the last proposition\r\noffered by the United States. When received, a further communication to\r\nyour excellency may be found proper, and if so will be made without\r\nunnecessary delay.\r\n\r\nIt can not be necessary to assure your excellency that the omission\r\nto reply to your communication forwarding to this Department the\r\nresolutions of the legislature of Maine did not in any degree arise\r\neither from a want of respect for their wishes or for the wishes of your\r\nexcellency, or from indifference to the interests of the State. When\r\nthese resolutions were received, there was every reason at no distant\r\nday to expect what is now daily looked for--a definitive answer to the\r\nproposition just alluded to, to which the attention of the British\r\nGovernment had been again forcibly invited about the time those\r\nresolutions were on their passage. Under this expectation a reply to\r\nthe application from Maine was temporarily delayed; the more readily as\r\nabout the time of its reception the Representatives of Maine, acting in\r\nreference to one of those resolutions, had a full and free conversation\r\nwith the President. The most recent proceedings relative to the question\r\nof boundary were shown to them in this Department by his directions, and\r\nthe occasion thus afforded was cheerfully embraced of offering frank and\r\nunreserved explanations of the President's views.\r\n\r\nOf the recent events which have called the attention of the State of\r\nMaine to the question of the northeastern boundary, and which have\r\nbeen brought by it to the notice of the President, one--the arrest\r\nand imprisonment of Mr. Greely--has already been made the subject of\r\ncommunication with your excellency. All that it was competent for the\r\nFederal Executive to do has been done. Redress has been demanded, will\r\nbe insisted upon, and is expected from that authority from whom alone\r\nredress can properly be sought. The President has followed the same\r\ncourse that was pursued by one of his predecessors and which was\r\nunderstood to be satisfactory to the State of Maine under circumstances\r\nof a somewhat similar character. In respect to the other--the projected\r\nconstruction of a railroad between St. Andrews and Quebec--a\r\nrepresentation has been addressed to the British Government stating that\r\nthe proposed measure is inconsistent with the understanding between the\r\ntwo Governments to preserve the _status quo_ in the disputed territory\r\nuntil the question of boundary be satisfactorily adjusted, remonstrating\r\nagainst the project as contrary to the American claim and demanding a\r\nsuspension of all further movements in execution of it. No answer has\r\nyet been received to this communication. From an informal conversation\r\nbetween the British minister at Washington and myself at the Department\r\nof State, the President is, however, firm in the conviction that the\r\nattempt to make the road in question will not be further prosecuted.\r\n\r\nI am, in conclusion, directed to inform you that however unbounded may\r\nbe the confidence of the legislature and people of Maine in the justice\r\nof their claim to the boundary contended for by the United States, the\r\nPresident's is not less so; and your excellency may rest assured that\r\nno exertions have been or shall be spared on his part to bring to a\r\nfavorable and speedy termination a question involving interests so\r\nhighly important to Maine and to the Union.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with high consideration, your excellency's\r\nobedient servant,\r\n\r\nJOHN FORSYTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE,\r\n\r\n_Washington, August 25, 1837_.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency ROBERT P. DUNLAP,\r\n\r\n_Governor of Maine_.\r\n\r\nSIR: I have the honor to transmit to your excellency, by direction\r\nof the President, the copy of a note from the British minister\r\nat Washington, dated yesterday, stating that the Government of\r\nHer Britannic Majesty has been pleased to direct the immediate\r\ndiscontinuance by the colonial authorities of Lower Canada and New\r\nBrunswick, respectively, of all operations connected with the projected\r\nrailroad between the cities of Quebec and St. Andrews.\r\n\r\nMr. Fox took occasion on Wednesday last to inform me that Mr. Greely\r\nhad been discharged from imprisonment at Frederickton, a fact of which\r\ndoubtlessly your excellency has been some time since apprised.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with high consideration, your excellency's\r\nobedient servant,\r\n\r\nJOHN FORSYTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE,\r\n\r\n_Washington, March 23, 1837_.\r\n\r\nHENRY S. FOX, Esq., etc.:\r\n\r\nThe undersigned, Secretary of State of the United States, has the honor,\r\nby direction of the President, to invite the attention of Mr. Fox, His\r\nBritannic Majesty's envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary,\r\nto a subject which from its high importance demands the prompt\r\nconsideration of His Majesty's Government.\r\n\r\nIt appears from representations and documents recently received at the\r\nDepartment of State that a number of inhabitants of the town of St.\r\nAndrews, in New Brunswick, associated themselves together in the year\r\n1835, by the name of the St. Andrews and Quebec Railroad Association,\r\nfor the purpose of bringing into public notice the practicability of\r\nconstructing a railway between those ports, and that sundry resolutions\r\nwere passed in furtherance of this object; that the project was\r\nsanctioned and patronized by the governor in chief of British North\r\nAmerica, the lieutenant-governors of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, and\r\nthe legislatures and people of the Provinces of Lower Canada and New\r\nBrunswick; that the route of the proposed railroad had been explored as\r\nfar as the head waters of the St. John River by surveyors employed by\r\nthe association; that an act has actually passed the legislature of\r\nNew Brunswick incorporating this company, and that a similar act was\r\nexpected to be passed in Lower Canada; that letters were addressed to\r\nthe boards of trade of Quebec and Montreal requesting their cooperation;\r\nthat these communications were favorably received, and that petitions\r\nhad been forwarded to His Britannic Majesty, signed by committees of the\r\nassociation and by inhabitants of the cities of Quebec and Montreal,\r\nsoliciting the construction of a railway between the ports above named,\r\nor the extension of royal aid and protection to the petitioners in the\r\nproposed undertaking.\r\n\r\nWithout allowing himself for a moment to believe that His Britannic\r\nMajesty's Government will in any manner countenance the projected\r\nrailroad from St. Andrews to Quebec when the slightest inspection of the\r\nmap of the country which it crosses will show that its intended location\r\nwould be for a great portion of the route an encroachment upon the\r\nterritory in dispute between the United States and Great Britain, the\r\nPresident yet sees cause for painful surprise and deep regret in the\r\nfact that the civil authorities of His Majesty's Provinces on our\r\nnortheastern borders should have lent their encouragement to or should\r\nin any wise have promoted an undertaking which if persevered in will\r\ninevitably lead to the most disastrous consequences. The object of the\r\nassociation from its inception was objectionable, since it could only be\r\neffected by entering upon territory the title to which was controverted\r\nand unsettled--a proceeding which could not fail to be offensive to the\r\nGovernment and people of the United States. Still more unjustifiable was\r\nthe act of sovereignty giving to this company corporate powers over\r\nproperty known to be claimed by citizens of a friendly and neighboring\r\nState, and which constituted at the time the subject of an amicable\r\nnegotiation between the Government of His Majesty and that of the\r\nUnited States. The President regrets to see in this step on the part of\r\nHis Majesty's provincial authorities and subjects a most exceptionable\r\ndeparture from the principle of continuing to abstain during the\r\nprogress of negotiation from any extension of the exercise of\r\njurisdiction within the disputed territory on either side, the propriety\r\nof which has been hitherto so sedulously inculcated and so distinctly\r\nacquiesced in by both parties. An understanding that this principle\r\nshould be observed by them was the natural result of the respective\r\npositions and pacific intentions of the two Governments, and could alone\r\nprevent the exercise of asserted rights by force. Without it the end of\r\nall negotiation on the subject would have been defeated. If, therefore,\r\nnothing had been said by either party relative to such an understanding,\r\nit would have been proper to infer that a tacit agreement to that effect\r\nexisted between the two Governments. But the correspondence between them\r\nis sufficiently full and explicit to prevent all misconception. The\r\nviews of both Governments in respect to it will be found in the letters\r\nof the Secretary of State to the minister of Great Britain dated the\r\n18th of January, 1826, 9th of January, 11th of March, and 11th of May,\r\n1829, and of the British minister to the Secretary of State dated 15th\r\nof November and 2d of December, 1825; 16th of January, 1827; 18th of\r\nFebruary and 25th of March, 1828, and 14th of April, 1833, as well as\r\nin other communications, which it is deemed needless now to designate.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned is directed by the President to inform Mr. Fox that\r\nthe prosecution of the enterprise above referred to will be regarded\r\nby this Government as a deliberate infringement of the rights of the\r\nUnited States to the territory in question and as an unwarrantable\r\nassumption of jurisdiction therein by the British Government, and the\r\nundersigned is instructed to urge the prompt adoption of such measures\r\nas may be deemed most appropriate by His Majesty's Government to suspend\r\nany further movements in execution of the proposed railroad from St.\r\nAndrews to Quebec during the continuance of the pending negotiations\r\nbetween the two Governments relative to the northeastern boundary of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings above alluded to, considered in connection with\r\nincidents on other parts of the disputed boundary line well known to\r\nHis Majesty's ministers, would seem to render it indispensable to the\r\nmaintenance of those liberal and friendly relations between the two\r\ncountries which both Governments are so sincerely anxious to preserve\r\nthat they should come to a speedy adjustment of the subject. The recent\r\nresolutions of the State of Maine, to which the projected railroad from\r\nSt. Andrews to Quebec gave rise, requesting the President of the United\r\nStates to cause the line established by the treaty of 1783 to be run and\r\nmonuments to be established thereon, and the appropriation of $20,000\r\nby Congress at their late session to enable the Executive to carry that\r\nrequest into effect, with a subsequent earnest application from the\r\nRepresentatives of Maine for an immediate compliance with it, afford\r\nadditional incentives to exertion to bring this controversy to a\r\nconclusion not to be disregarded by the President of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe President therefore awaits with great anxiety the decision of His\r\nMajesty's Government on the proposition made by the undersigned to His\r\nMajesty's chargé d'affaires at Washington in February, 1836, suggesting\r\nthe river St. John, from its mouth to its source, as an eligible and\r\nconvenient line of boundary. No small degree of disappointment has been\r\nfelt that this decision, already long expected, has not been given, but\r\nthe hope is entertained that the result of this protracted deliberation\r\nwill prove favorable to the wishes of the President, and that even\r\nif that proposition be not acceded to by His Britannic Majesty some\r\ndefinitive offer looking to a prompt termination of the controversy\r\nwill be made without further delay.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned avails himself of this occasion to renew to Mr. Fox the\r\nassurance of his distinguished consideration.\r\n\r\nJOHN FORSYTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 28, 1837_.\r\n  Hon. JOHN FORSYTH, etc.:\r\n\r\nThe undersigned, His Britannic Majesty's envoy extraordinary and\r\nminister plenipotentiary, has had the honor to receive the official note\r\naddressed to him under date of the 23d instant by Mr. Forsyth, Secretary\r\nof State of the United States, upon the subject of information received\r\nby the United States Government of a projected railroad between the\r\ncities of Quebec and St. Andrews, and upon certain other matters\r\nconnected with the question of the boundary line between the United\r\nStates and the British possessions in North America.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned, in accordance with the wishes of the President\r\nsignified in Mr. Forsyth's official note, will not fail immediately\r\nto convey that note to the knowledge of his Government at home; and he\r\nentertains no doubt that His Majesty's Government will proceed to the\r\nconsideration of the several matters therein contained with the serious\r\nand ready attention that their importance deserves.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned avails himself of this occasion to renew to Mr. Forsyth\r\nthe assurance of his high esteem and consideration.\r\n\r\nH.S. FOX.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _August 24, 1837_.\r\n\r\nHon. JOHN FORSYTH, etc.\r\n\r\nSIR: With reference to the official note which, by direction of the\r\nPresident, you addressed to me on the 23d of March last, respecting a\r\nprojected railroad between the cities of Quebec and St. Andrews, which\r\nit was apprehended would, if carried into effect, traverse a part of\r\nthe territory at present in dispute between Great Britain and the\r\nUnited States, I am now enabled to inform you that, in consideration of\r\nthe arguments and observations contained in your note, Her Majesty's\r\nGovernment has been pleased to direct the colonial authorities of\r\nLower Canada and New Brunswick, respectively, to cause all operations\r\nconnected with the above-mentioned project within the limits of the\r\ndisputed territory to be immediately discontinued.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, sir, with high respect and consideration, your\r\nmost obedient and humble servant,\r\n\r\nH.S. FOX.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Stevenson to Lord Palmerston_.\r\n\r\n[Extract.]\r\n\r\n23 PORTLAND PLACE, _August 10, 1837_.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned will avail himself of the occasion to remind Lord\r\nPalmerston of the urgency which exists for the immediate and final\r\nadjustment of this long-pending controversy [respecting the northeastern\r\nboundary] and the increased obstacles which will be thrown in the way\r\nof its harmonious settlement by these repeated collisions of authority\r\nand the exercise of exclusive jurisdiction by either party within the\r\ndisputed territory.\r\n\r\nHe begs leave also to repeat to his lordship assurances of the\r\nearnest and unabated desire which the President feels that the\r\ncontroversy should be speedily and amicably settled, and to express the\r\nanxiety with which the Government of the United States is waiting the\r\npromised decision of Her Majesty's Government upon the proposition\r\nsubmitted to it as far back as July, 1836, and which the undersigned\r\nhad been led to believe would long since have been given; and he has\r\nbeen further directed to say that should this proposition be disapproved\r\nthe President entertains the hope that some new one, on the part of\r\nHer Majesty's Government, will immediately be made for the final and\r\nfavorable termination of this protracted and deeply exciting\r\ncontroversy.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned begs Lord Palmerston to receive renewed assurances of\r\nhis distinguished consideration.\r\n\r\nA.

VAN BUREN.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  JOHN FORSYTH,\r\n    _Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST ANNUAL MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 5, 1837_.\r\n\r\n_Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nWe have reason to renew the expression of our devout gratitude to the\r\nGiver of All Good for His benign protection. Our country presents on\r\nevery side the evidences of that continued favor under whose auspices\r\nit has gradually risen from a few feeble and dependent colonies to a\r\nprosperous and powerful confederacy. We are blessed with domestic\r\ntranquillity and all the elements of national prosperity. The pestilence\r\nwhich, invading for a time some flourishing portions of the Union,\r\ninterrupted the general prevalence of unusual health has happily been\r\nlimited in extent and arrested in its fatal career. The industry and\r\nprudence of our citizens are gradually relieving them from the pecuniary\r\nembarrassments under which portions of them have labored; judicious\r\nlegislation and the natural and boundless resources of the country have\r\nafforded wise and timely aid to private enterprise, and the activity\r\nalways characteristic of our people has already in a great degree\r\nresumed its usual and profitable channels.\r\n\r\nThe condition of our foreign relations has not materially changed since\r\nthe last annual message of my predecessor. We remain at peace with all\r\nnations, and no efforts on my part consistent with the preservation of\r\nour rights and the honor of the country shall be spared to maintain a\r\nposition so consonant to our institutions. We have faithfully sustained\r\nthe foreign policy with which the United States, under the guidance of\r\ntheir first President, took their stand in the family of nations--that\r\nof regulating their intercourse with other powers by the approved\r\nprinciples of private life; asking and according equal rights and equal\r\nprivileges; rendering and demanding justice in all cases; advancing\r\ntheir own and discussing the pretensions of others with candor,\r\ndirectness, and sincerity; appealing at all times to reason, but never\r\nyielding to force nor seeking to acquire anything for themselves by\r\nits exercise.\r\n\r\nA rigid adherence to this policy has left this Government with scarcely\r\na claim upon its justice for injuries arising from acts committed by\r\nits authority. The most imposing and perplexing of those of the United\r\nStates upon foreign governments for aggressions upon our citizens were\r\ndisposed of by my predecessor. Independently of the benefits conferred\r\nupon our citizens by restoring to the mercantile community so many\r\nmillions of which they had been wrongfully divested, a great service\r\nwas also rendered to his country by the satisfactory adjustment of so\r\nmany ancient and irritating subjects of contention; and it reflects no\r\nordinary credit on his successful administration of public affairs that\r\nthis great object was accomplished without compromising on any occasion\r\neither the honor or the peace of the nation.\r\n\r\nWith European powers no new subjects of difficulty have arisen, and\r\nthose which were under discussion, although not terminated, do not\r\npresent a more unfavorable aspect for the future preservation of that\r\ngood understanding which it has ever been our desire to cultivate.\r\n\r\nOf pending questions the most important is that which exists with the\r\nGovernment of Great Britain in respect to our northeastern boundary. It\r\nis with unfeigned regret that the people of the United States must look\r\nback upon the abortive efforts made by the Executive, for a period of\r\nmore than half a century, to determine what no nation should suffer long\r\nto remain in dispute--the true line which divides its possessions from\r\nthose of other powers. The nature of the settlements on the borders of\r\nthe United States and of the neighboring territory was for a season such\r\nthat this, perhaps, was not indispensable to a faithful performance of\r\nthe duties of the Federal Government. Time has, however, changed this\r\nstate of things, and has brought about a condition of affairs in which\r\nthe true interests of both countries imperatively require that this\r\nquestion should be put at rest. It is not to be disguised that, with\r\nfull confidence, often expressed, in the desire of the British\r\nGovernment to terminate it, we are apparently as far from its adjustment\r\nas we were at the time of signing the treaty of peace in 1783. The sole\r\nresult of long-pending negotiations and a perplexing arbitration appears\r\nto be a conviction on its part that a conventional line must be adopted,\r\nfrom the impossibility of ascertaining the true one according to the\r\ndescription contained in that treaty. Without coinciding in this\r\nopinion, which is not thought to be well founded, my predecessor gave\r\nthe strongest proof of the earnest desire of the United States to\r\nterminate satisfactorily this dispute by proposing the substitution\r\nof a conventional line if the consent of the States interested in the\r\nquestion could be obtained. To this proposition no answer has as yet\r\nbeen received. The attention of the British Government has, however,\r\nbeen urgently invited to the subject, and its reply can not, I am\r\nconfident, be much longer delayed. The general relations between Great\r\nBritain and the United States are of the most friendly character, and\r\nI am well satisfied of the sincere disposition of that Government to\r\nmaintain them upon their present footing. This disposition has also,\r\nI am persuaded, become more general with the people of England than\r\nat any previous period. It is scarcely necessary to say to you how\r\ncordially it is reciprocated by the Government and people of the United\r\nStates. The conviction, which must be common to all, of the injurious\r\nconsequences that result from keeping open this irritating question, and\r\nthe certainty that its final settlement can not be much longer deferred,\r\nwill, I trust, lead to an early and satisfactory adjustment. At your\r\nlast session I laid before you the recent communications between the two\r\nGovernments and between this Government and that of the State of Maine,\r\nin whose solicitude concerning a subject in which she has so deep an\r\ninterest every portion of the Union participates.\r\n\r\nThe feelings produced by a temporary interruption of those harmonious\r\nrelations between France and the United States which are due as well\r\nto the recollections of former times as to a correct appreciation of\r\nexisting interests have been happily succeeded by a cordial disposition\r\non both sides to cultivate an active friendship in their future\r\nintercourse. The opinion, undoubtedly correct, and steadily entertained\r\nby us, that the commercial relations at present existing between the\r\ntwo countries are susceptible of great and reciprocally beneficial\r\nimprovements is obviously gaining ground in France, and I am assured\r\nof the disposition of that Government to favor the accomplishment of\r\nsuch an object. This disposition shall be met in a proper spirit on our\r\npart. The few and comparatively unimportant questions that remain to\r\nbe adjusted between us can, I have no doubt, be settled with entire\r\nsatisfaction and without difficulty.\r\n\r\nBetween Russia and the United States sentiments of good will continue to\r\nbe mutually cherished. Our minister recently accredited to that Court\r\nhas been received with a frankness and cordiality and with evidences of\r\nrespect for his country which leave us no room to doubt the preservation\r\nin future of those amicable and liberal relations which have so long\r\nand so uninterruptedly existed between the two countries. On the few\r\nsubjects under discussion between us an early and just decision is\r\nconfidently anticipated.\r\n\r\nA correspondence has been opened with the Government of Austria for the\r\nestablishment of diplomatic relations, in conformity with the wishes of\r\nCongress as indicated by an appropriation act of the session of 1837,\r\nand arrangements made for the purpose, which will be duly carried\r\ninto effect.\r\n\r\nWith Austria and Prussia and with the States of the German Empire (now\r\ncomposing with the latter the Commercial League) our political relations\r\nare of the most friendly character, whilst our commercial intercourse is\r\ngradually extending, with benefit to all who are engaged in it.\r\n\r\nCivil war yet rages in Spain, producing intense suffering to its own\r\npeople, and to other nations inconvenience and regret. Our citizens\r\nwho have claims upon that country will be prejudiced for a time by the\r\ncondition of its treasury, the inevitable consequence of long-continued\r\nand exhausting internal wars. The last installment of the interest of\r\nthe debt due under the convention with the Queen of Spain has not been\r\npaid and similar failures may be expected to happen until a portion of\r\nthe resources of her Kingdom can be devoted to the extinguishment of\r\nits foreign debt.\r\n\r\nHaving received satisfactory evidence that discriminating tonnage\r\nduties were charged upon the vessels of the United States in the ports\r\nof Portugal, a proclamation was issued on the 11th day of October last,\r\nin compliance with the act of May 25, 1832, declaring that fact, and the\r\nduties on foreign tonnage which were levied upon Portuguese vessels in\r\nthe United States previously to the passage of that act are accordingly\r\nrevived.\r\n\r\nThe act of July 4, 1836, suspending the discriminating duties upon\r\nthe produce of Portugal imported into this country in Portuguese\r\nvessels, was passed, upon the application of that Government through its\r\nrepresentative here, under the belief that no similar discrimination\r\nexisted in Portugal to the prejudice of the United States. I regret to\r\nstate that such duties are now exacted in that country upon the cargoes\r\nof American vessels, and as the act referred to vests no discretion in\r\nthe Executive, it is for Congress to determine upon the expediency of\r\nfurther legislation on the subject. Against these discriminations\r\naffecting the vessels of this country and their cargoes seasonable\r\nremonstrance was made, and notice was given to the Portuguese Government\r\nthat unless they should be discontinued the adoption of countervailing\r\nmeasures on the part of the United States would become necessary; but\r\nthe reply of that Government, received at the Department of State\r\nthrough our chargé d'affaires at Lisbon in the month of September last,\r\nafforded no ground to hope for the abandonment of a system so little in\r\nharmony with the treatment shown to the vessels of Portugal and their\r\ncargoes in the ports of this country and so contrary to the expectations\r\nwe had a right to entertain.\r\n\r\nWith Holland, Sweden, Denmark, Naples, and Belgium a friendly\r\nintercourse has been uninterruptedly maintained.\r\n\r\nWith the Government of the Ottoman Porte and its dependencies on the\r\ncoast of the Mediterranean peace and good will are carefully cultivated,\r\nand have been fostered by such good offices as the relative distance and\r\nthe condition of those countries would permit.\r\n\r\nOur commerce with Greece is carried on under the laws of the two\r\nGovernments, reciprocally beneficial to the navigating interests of\r\nboth; and I have reason to look forward to the adoption of other\r\nmeasures which will be more extensively and permanently advantageous.\r\n\r\nCopies of the treaties concluded with the Governments of Siam and Muscat\r\nare transmitted for the information of Congress, the ratifications\r\nhaving been received and the treaties made public since the close of the\r\nlast annual session. Already have we reason to congratulate ourselves on\r\nthe prospect of considerable commercial benefit; and we have, besides,\r\nreceived from the Sultan of Muscat prompt evidence of his desire to\r\ncultivate the most friendly feelings, by liberal acts toward one of\r\nour vessels, bestowed in a manner so striking as to require on our part\r\na grateful acknowledgment.\r\n\r\nOur commerce with the islands of Cuba and Porto Rico still labors under\r\nheavy restrictions, the continuance of which is a subject of regret. The\r\nonly effect of an adherence to them will be to benefit the navigation of\r\nother countries at the expense of both the United States and Spain.\r\n\r\nThe independent nations of this continent have ever since they\r\nemerged from the colonial state experienced severe trials in their\r\nprogress to the permanent establishment of liberal political\r\ninstitutions. Their unsettled condition not only interrupts their own\r\nadvances to prosperity, but has often seriously injured the other powers\r\nof the world. The claims of our citizens upon Peru, Chili, Brazil, the\r\nArgentine Republic, the Governments formed out of the Republics of\r\nColombia and Mexico, are still pending, although many of them have\r\nbeen presented for examination more than twenty years. New Granada,\r\nVenezuela, and Ecuador have recently formed a convention for the purpose\r\nof ascertaining and adjusting claims upon the Republic of Colombia,\r\nfrom which it is earnestly hoped our citizens will ere long receive\r\nfull compensation for the injuries inflicted upon them and for the delay\r\nin affording it.\r\n\r\nAn advantageous treaty of commerce has been concluded by the\r\nUnited States with the Peru-Bolivian Confederation, which wants only\r\nthe ratification of that Government. The progress of a subsequent\r\nnegotiation for the settlement of claims upon Peru has been unfavorably\r\naffected by the war between that power and Chili and the Argentine\r\nRepublic, and the same event is also likely to produce delays in the\r\nsettlement of our demands on those powers.\r\n\r\nThe aggravating circumstances connected with our claims upon Mexico and\r\na variety of events touching the honor and integrity of our Government\r\nled my predecessor to make at the second session of the last Congress a\r\nspecial recommendation of the course to be pursued to obtain a speedy\r\nand final satisfaction of the injuries complained of by this Government\r\nand by our citizens. He recommended a final demand of redress, with a\r\ncontingent authority to the Executive to make reprisals if that demand\r\nshould be made in vain. From the proceedings of Congress on that\r\nrecommendation it appeared that the opinion of both branches of the\r\nLegislature coincided with that of the Executive, that any mode of\r\nredress known to the law of nations might justifiably be used. It was\r\nobvious, too, that Congress believed with the President that another\r\ndemand should be made, in order to give undeniable and satisfactory\r\nproof of our desire to avoid extremities with a neighboring power, but\r\nthat there was an indisposition to vest a discretionary authority in\r\nthe Executive to take redress should it unfortunately be either denied\r\nor unreasonably delayed by the Mexican Government.\r\n\r\nSo soon as the necessary documents were prepared, after entering upon\r\nthe duties of my office, a special messenger was sent to Mexico to make\r\na final demand of redress, with the documents required by the provisions\r\nof our treaty. The demand was made on the 20th of July last. The reply,\r\nwhich bears date the 29th of the same month, contains assurances of a\r\ndesire on the part of that Government to give a prompt and explicit\r\nanswer respecting each of the complaints, but that the examination of\r\nthem would necessarily be deliberate; that in this examination it\r\nwould be guided by the principles of public law and the obligation\r\nof treaties; that nothing should be left undone that might lead to\r\nthe most speedy and equitable adjustment of our demands, and that its\r\ndetermination in respect to each case should be communicated through\r\nthe Mexican minister here.\r\n\r\nSince that time an envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary\r\nhas been accredited to this Government by that of the Mexican Republic.\r\nHe brought with him assurances of a sincere desire that the pending\r\ndifferences between the two Governments should be terminated in\r\na manner satisfactory to both. He was received with reciprocal\r\nassurances, and a hope was entertained that his mission would lead\r\nto a speedy, satisfactory, and final adjustment of all existing subjects\r\nof complaint. A sincere believer in the wisdom of the pacific policy by\r\nwhich the United States have always been governed in their intercourse\r\nwith foreign nations, it was my particular desire, from the proximity\r\nof the Mexican Republic and well-known occurrences on our frontier,\r\nto be instrumental in obviating all existing difficulties with that\r\nGovernment and in restoring to the intercourse between the two Republics\r\nthat liberal and friendly character by which they should always be\r\ndistinguished. I regret, therefore, the more deeply to have found in the\r\nrecent communications of that Government so little reason to hope that\r\nany future efforts of mine for the accomplishment of those desirable\r\nobjects would be successful.\r\n\r\nAlthough the larger number--and many of them aggravated cases of\r\npersonal wrongs--have been now for years before the Mexican Government,\r\nand some of the causes of national complaint, and those of the most\r\noffensive character, admitted of immediate, simple, and satisfactory\r\nreplies, it is only within a few days past that any specific\r\ncommunication in answer to our last demand, made five months ago, has\r\nbeen received from the Mexican minister. By the report of the Secretary\r\nof State herewith presented and the accompanying documents it will be\r\nseen that for not one of our public complaints has satisfaction been\r\ngiven or offered, that but one of the cases of personal wrong has been\r\nfavorably considered, and that but four cases of both descriptions out\r\nof all those formally presented and earnestly pressed have as yet been\r\ndecided upon by the Mexican Government.\r\n\r\nNot perceiving in what manner any of the powers given to the Executive\r\nalone could be further usefully employed in bringing this unfortunate\r\ncontroversy to a satisfactory termination, the subject was by my\r\npredecessor referred to Congress as one calling for its interposition.\r\nIn accordance with the clearly understood wishes of the Legislature,\r\nanother and formal demand for satisfaction has been made upon the\r\nMexican Government, with what success the documents now communicated\r\nwill show. On a careful and deliberate examination of their contents,\r\nand considering the spirit manifested by the Mexican Government, it\r\nhas become my painful duty to return the subject as it now stands to\r\nCongress, to whom it belongs to decide upon the time, the mode, and\r\nthe measure of redress. Whatever may be your decision, it shall be\r\nfaithfully executed, confident that it will be characterized by that\r\nmoderation and justice which will, I trust, under all circumstances\r\ngovern the councils of our country.\r\n\r\nThe balance in the Treasury on the 1st January, 1837, was $45,968,523.\r\nThe receipts during the present year from all sources, including\r\nthe amount of Treasury notes issued, are estimated at $23,499,981,\r\nconstituting an aggregate of $69,468,504. Of this amount about\r\n$35,281,361 will have been expended at the end of the year on\r\nappropriations made by Congress, and the residue, amounting to\r\n$34,187,143, will be the nominal balance in the Treasury on the\r\n1st of January next; but of that sum only $1,085,498 is considered as\r\nimmediately available for and applicable to public purposes. Those\r\nportions of it which will be for some time unavailable consist chiefly\r\nof sums deposited with the States and due from the former deposit banks.\r\nThe details upon this subject will be found in the annual report of the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury. The amount of Treasury notes which it will be\r\nnecessary to issue during the year on account of those funds being\r\nunavailable will, it is supposed, not exceed four and a half millions.\r\nIt seemed proper, in the condition of the country, to have the estimates\r\non all subjects made as low as practicable without prejudice to any\r\ngreat public measures. The Departments were therefore desired to prepare\r\ntheir estimates accordingly, and I am happy to find that they have been\r\nable to graduate them on so economical a scale. In the great and often\r\nunexpected fluctuations to which the revenue is subjected it is not\r\npossible to compute the receipts beforehand with great certainty,\r\nbut should they not differ essentially from present anticipations,\r\nand should the appropriations not much exceed the estimates, no\r\ndifficulty seems likely to happen in defraying the current expenses\r\nwith promptitude and fidelity.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the great embarrassments which have recently\r\noccurred in commercial affairs, and the liberal indulgence which in\r\nconsequence of these embarrassments has been extended to both the\r\nmerchants and the banks, it is gratifying to be able to anticipate that\r\nthe Treasury notes which have been issued during the present year will\r\nbe redeemed and that the resources of the Treasury, without any resort\r\nto loans or increased taxes, will prove ample for defraying all charges\r\nimposed on it during 1838.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Treasury will afford you a more\r\nminute exposition of all matters connected with the administration of\r\nthe finances during the current year--a period which for the amount of\r\npublic moneys disbursed and deposited with the States, as well as the\r\nfinancial difficulties encountered and overcome, has few parallels in\r\nour history.\r\n\r\nYour attention was at the last session invited to the necessity of\r\nadditional legislative provisions in respect to the collection,\r\nsafe-keeping, and transfer of the public money. No law having been then\r\nmatured, and not understanding the proceedings of Congress as intended\r\nto be final, it becomes my duty again to bring the subject to your\r\nnotice.\r\n\r\nOn that occasion three modes of performing this branch of the public\r\nservice were presented for consideration. These were, the creation of\r\na national bank; the revival, with modifications, of the deposit system\r\nestablished by the act of the 23d of June, 1836, permitting the use\r\nof the public moneys by the banks; and the discontinuance of the use of\r\nsuch institutions for the purposes referred to, with suitable provisions\r\nfor their accomplishment through the agency of public officers.\r\nConsidering the opinions of both Houses of Congress on the first two\r\npropositions as expressed in the negative, in which I entirely concur,\r\nit is unnecessary for me again to recur to them. In respect to the last,\r\nyou have had an opportunity since your adjournment not only to test\r\nstill further the expediency of the measure by the continued practical\r\noperation of such parts of it as are now in force, but also to discover\r\nwhat should ever be sought for and regarded with the utmost\r\ndeference--the opinions and wishes of the people.\r\n\r\nThe national will is the supreme law of the Republic, and on all\r\nsubjects within the limits of his constitutional powers should be\r\nfaithfully obeyed by the public servant. Since the measure in question\r\nwas submitted to your consideration most of you have enjoyed the\r\nadvantage of personal communication with your constituents. For one\r\nState only has an election been held for the Federal Government;\r\nbut the early day at which it took place deprived the measure under\r\nconsideration of much of the support it might otherwise have derived\r\nfrom the result. Local elections for State officers have, however,\r\nbeen held in several of the States, at which the expediency of the plan\r\nproposed by the Executive has been more or less discussed. You will,\r\nI am confident, yield to their results the respect due to every\r\nexpression of the public voice. Desiring, however, to arrive at truth\r\nand a just view of the subject in all its bearings, you will at the same\r\ntime remember that questions of far deeper and more immediate local\r\ninterest than the fiscal plans of the National Treasury were involved in\r\nthose elections. Above all, we can not overlook the striking fact that\r\nthere were at the time in those States more than one hundred and sixty\r\nmillions of bank capital, of which large portions were subject to actual\r\nforfeiture, other large portions upheld only by special and limited\r\nlegislative indulgences, and most of it, if not all, to a greater or\r\nless extent dependent for a continuance of its corporate existence upon\r\nthe will of the State legislatures to be then chosen. Apprised of this\r\ncircumstance, you will judge whether it is not most probable that the\r\npeculiar condition of that vast interest in these respects, the extent\r\nto which it has been spread through all the ramifications of society,\r\nits direct connection with the then pending elections, and the feelings\r\nit was calculated to infuse into the canvass have exercised a far\r\ngreater influence over the result than any which could possibly have\r\nbeen produced by a conflict of opinion in respect to a question in the\r\nadministration of the General Government more remote and far less\r\nimportant in its bearings upon that interest.\r\n\r\nI have found no reason to change my own opinion as to the expediency\r\nof adopting the system proposed, being perfectly satisfied that there\r\nwill be neither stability nor safety either in the fiscal affairs\r\nof the Government or in the pecuniary transactions of individuals and\r\ncorporations so long as a connection exists between them which, like\r\nthe past, offers such strong inducements to make them the subjects\r\nof political agitation. Indeed, I am more than ever convinced of\r\nthe dangers to which the free and unbiased exercise of political\r\nopinion--the only sure foundation and safeguard of republican\r\ngovernment--would be exposed by any further increase of the already\r\novergrown influence of corporate authorities. I can not, therefore,\r\nconsistently with my views of duty, advise a renewal of a connection\r\nwhich circumstances have dissolved.\r\n\r\nThe discontinuance of the use of State banks for fiscal purposes ought\r\nnot to be regarded as a measure of hostility toward those institutions.\r\nBanks properly established and conducted are highly useful to the\r\nbusiness of the country, and will doubtless continue to exist in the\r\nStates so long as they conform to their laws and are found to be safe\r\nand beneficial. How they should be created, what privileges they should\r\nenjoy, under what responsibilities they should act, and to what\r\nrestrictions they should be subject are questions which, as I observed\r\non a previous occasion, belong to the States to decide. Upon their\r\nrights or the exercise of them the General Government can have no motive\r\nto encroach. Its duty toward them is well performed when it refrains\r\nfrom legislating for their special benefit, because such legislation\r\nwould violate the spirit of the Constitution and be unjust to other\r\ninterests; when it takes no steps to impair their usefulness, but so\r\nmanages its own affairs as to make it the interest of those institutions\r\nto strengthen and improve their condition for the security and welfare\r\nof the community at large. They have no right to insist on a connection\r\nwith the Federal Government, nor on the use of the public money for\r\ntheir own benefit. The object of the measure under consideration is to\r\navoid for the future a compulsory connection of this kind. It proposes\r\nto place the General Government, in regard to the essential points of\r\nthe collection, safe-keeping, and transfer of the public money, in a\r\nsituation which shall relieve it from all dependence on the will of\r\nirresponsible individuals or corporations; to withdraw those moneys from\r\nthe uses of private trade and confide them to agents constitutionally\r\nselected and controlled by law; to abstain from improper interference\r\nwith the industry of the people and withhold inducements to improvident\r\ndealings on the part of individuals; to give stability to the concerns\r\nof the Treasury; to preserve the measures of the Government from the\r\nunavoidable reproaches that flow from such a connection, and the banks\r\nthemselves from the injurious effects of a supposed participation in the\r\npolitical conflicts of the day, from which they will otherwise find it\r\ndifficult to escape.\r\n\r\nThese are my views upon this important subject, formed after careful\r\nreflection and with no desire but to arrive at what is most likely\r\nto promote the public interest. They are now, as they were before,\r\nsubmitted with unfeigned deference for the opinions of others. It was\r\nhardly to be hoped that changes so important on a subject so interesting\r\ncould be made without producing a serious diversity of opinion; but\r\nso long as those conflicting views are kept above the influence of\r\nindividual or local interests, so long as they pursue only the general\r\ngood and are discussed with moderation and candor, such diversity is a\r\nbenefit, not an injury. If a majority of Congress see the public welfare\r\nin a different light, and more especially if they should be satisfied\r\nthat the measure proposed would not be acceptable to the people, I shall\r\nlook to their wisdom to substitute such as may be more conducive to\r\nthe one and more satisfactory to the other. In any event, they may\r\nconfidently rely on my hearty cooperation to the fullest extent to\r\nwhich my views of the Constitution and my sense of duty will permit.\r\n\r\nIt is obviously important to this branch of the public service and to\r\nthe business and quiet of the country that the whole subject should in\r\nsome way be settled and regulated by law, and, if possible, at your\r\npresent session. Besides the plans above referred to, I am not aware\r\nthat any one has been suggested except that of keeping the public money\r\nin the State banks in special deposit. This plan is to some extent in\r\naccordance with the practice of the Government and with the present\r\narrangements of the Treasury Department, which, except, perhaps, during\r\nthe operation of the late deposit act, has always been allowed, even\r\nduring the existence of a national bank, to make a temporary use of the\r\nState banks in particular places for the safe-keeping of portions of the\r\nrevenue. This discretionary power might be continued if Congress deem it\r\ndesirable, whatever general system be adopted. So long as the connection\r\nis voluntary we need, perhaps, anticipate few of those difficulties and\r\nlittle of that dependence on the banks which must attend every such\r\nconnection when compulsory in its nature and when so arranged as to make\r\nthe banks a fixed part of the machinery of government. It is undoubtedly\r\nin the power of Congress so to regulate and guard it as to prevent the\r\npublic money from being applied to the use or intermingled with the\r\naffairs of individuals. Thus arranged, although it would not give to\r\nthe Government that entire control over its own funds which I desire to\r\nsecure to it by the plan I have proposed, it would, it must be admitted,\r\nin a great degree accomplish one of the objects which has recommended\r\nthat plan to my judgment--the separation of the fiscal concerns of the\r\nGovernment from those of individuals or corporations.\r\n\r\nWith these observations I recommend the whole matter to your\r\ndispassionate reflection, confidently hoping that some conclusion may\r\nbe reached by your deliberations which on the one hand shall give\r\nsafety and stability to the fiscal operations of the Government, and\r\nbe consistent, on the other, with the genius of our institutions and\r\nwith the interests and wishes of the great mass of our constituents.\r\n\r\nIt was my hope that nothing would occur to make necessary on\r\nthis occasion any allusion to the late national bank. There are\r\ncircumstances, however, connected with the present state of its affairs\r\nthat bear so directly on the character of the Government and the welfare\r\nof the citizen that I should not feel myself excused in neglecting to\r\nnotice them. The charter which terminated its banking privileges on the\r\n4th of March, 1836, continued its corporate power two years more for\r\nthe sole purpose of closing its affairs, with authority \"to use the\r\ncorporate name, style, and capacity for the purpose of suits for a final\r\nsettlement and liquidation of the affairs and acts of the corporation,\r\nand for the sale and disposition of their estate--real, personal, and\r\nmixed--but for no other purpose or in any other manner whatsoever.\" Just\r\nbefore the banking privileges ceased, its effects were transferred by\r\nthe bank to a new State institution, then recently incorporated, in\r\ntrust, for the discharge of its debts and the settlement of its affairs.\r\nWith this trustee, by authority of Congress, an adjustment was\r\nsubsequently made of the large interest which the Government had in the\r\nstock of the institution. The manner in which a trust unexpectedly\r\ncreated upon the act granting the charter, and involving such great\r\npublic interests, has been executed would under any circumstances be a\r\nfit subject of inquiry; but much more does it deserve your attention\r\nwhen it embraces the redemption of obligations to which the authority\r\nand credit of the United States have given value. The two years allowed\r\nare now nearly at an end. It is well understood that the trustee has\r\nnot redeemed and canceled the outstanding notes of the bank, but has\r\nreissued and is actually reissuing, since the 3d of March, 1836, the\r\nnotes which have been received by it to a vast amount. According to its\r\nown official statement, so late as the 1st of October last, nineteen\r\nmonths after the banking privileges given by the charter had expired, it\r\nhad under its control uncanceled notes of the late Bank of the United\r\nStates to the amount of $27,561,866, of which $6,175,861 were in actual\r\ncirculation, $1,468,627 at State bank agencies, and $3,002,390 _in\r\ntransitu_, thus showing that upward of ten millions and a half of the\r\nnotes of the old bank were then still kept outstanding.\r\n\r\nThe impropriety of this procedure is obvious, it being the duty of the\r\ntrustee to cancel and not to put forth the notes of an institution whose\r\nconcerns it had undertaken to wind up. If the trustee has a right to\r\nreissue these notes now, I can see no reason why it may not continue\r\nto do so after the expiration of the two years. As no one could have\r\nanticipated a course so extraordinary, the prohibitory clause of the\r\ncharter above quoted was not accompanied by any penalty or other special\r\nprovision for enforcing it, nor have we any general law for the\r\nprevention of similar acts in future.\r\n\r\nBut it is not in this view of the subject alone that your interposition\r\nis required. The United States in settling with the trustee for their\r\nstock have withdrawn their funds from their former direct liability to\r\nthe creditors of the old bank, yet notes of the institution continue\r\nto be sent forth in its name, and apparently upon the authority of the\r\nUnited States. The transactions connected with the employment of the\r\nbills of the old bank are of vast extent, and should they result\r\nunfortunately the interests of individuals may be deeply compromised.\r\nWithout undertaking to decide how far or in what form, if any, the\r\ntrustee could be made liable for notes which contain no obligation on\r\nits part, or the old bank for such as are put in circulation after the\r\nexpiration of its charter and without its authority, or the Government\r\nfor indemnity in case of loss, the question still presses itself upon\r\nyour consideration whether it is consistent with duty and good faith on\r\nthe part of the Government to witness this proceeding without a single\r\neffort to arrest it.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Commissioner of the General Land Office, which will\r\nbe laid before you by the Secretary of the Treasury, will show how the\r\naffairs of that office have been conducted for the past year. The\r\ndisposition of the public lands is one of the most important trusts\r\nconfided to Congress. The practicability of retaining the title and\r\ncontrol of such extensive domains in the General Government, and at the\r\nsame time admitting the Territories embracing them into the Federal\r\nUnion as coequals with the original States, was seriously doubted by\r\nmany of our wisest statesmen. All feared that they would become a source\r\nof discord, and many carried their apprehensions so far as to see in\r\nthem the seeds of a future dissolution of the Confederacy. But happily\r\nour experience has already been sufficient to quiet in a great degree\r\nall such apprehensions. The position at one time assumed, that the\r\nadmission of new States into the Union on the same footing with the\r\noriginal States was incompatible with a right of soil in the United\r\nStates and operated as a surrender thereof, notwithstanding the terms of\r\nthe compacts by which their admission was designed to be regulated, has\r\nbeen wisely abandoned. Whether in the new or the old States, all now\r\nagree that the right of soil to the public lands remains in the Federal\r\nGovernment, and that these lands constitute a common property, to be\r\ndisposed of for the common benefit of all the States, old and new.\r\nAcquiescence in this just principle by the people of the new States has\r\nnaturally promoted a disposition to adopt the most liberal policy in the\r\nsale of the public lands. A policy which should be limited to the mere\r\nobject of selling the lands for the greatest possible sum of money,\r\nwithout regard to higher considerations, finds but few advocates. On the\r\ncontrary, it is generally conceded that whilst the mode of disposition\r\nadopted by the Government should always be a prudent one, yet its\r\nleading object ought to be the early settlement and cultivation of the\r\nlands sold, and that it should discountenance, if it can not prevent,\r\nthe accumulation of large tracts in the same hands, which must\r\nnecessarily retard the growth of the new States or entail upon them\r\na dependent tenantry and its attendant evils.\r\n\r\nA question embracing such important interests and so well calculated\r\nto enlist the feelings of the people in every quarter of the Union has\r\nvery naturally given rise to numerous plans for the improvement of\r\nthe existing system. The distinctive features of the policy that has\r\nhitherto prevailed are to dispose of the public lands at moderate\r\nprices, thus enabling a greater number to enter into competition for\r\ntheir purchase and accomplishing a double object--of promoting their\r\nrapid settlement by the purchasers and at the same time increasing the\r\nreceipts of the Treasury; to sell for cash, thereby preventing the\r\ndisturbing influence of a large mass of private citizens indebted to\r\nthe Government which they have a voice in controlling; to bring them\r\ninto market no faster than good lands are supposed to be wanted for\r\nimprovement, thereby preventing the accumulation of large tracts in few\r\nhands; and to apply the proceeds of the sales to the general purposes of\r\nthe Government, thus diminishing the amount to be raised from the people\r\nof the States by taxation and giving each State its portion of the\r\nbenefits to be derived from this common fund in a manner the most quiet,\r\nand at the same time, perhaps, the most equitable, that can be devised.\r\nThese provisions, with occasional enactments in behalf of special\r\ninterests deemed entitled to the favor of the Government, have in their\r\nexecution produced results as beneficial upon the whole as could\r\nreasonably be expected in a matter so vast, so complicated, and so\r\nexciting. Upward of 70,000,000 acres have been sold, the greater part of\r\nwhich is believed to have been purchased for actual settlement. The\r\npopulation of the new States and Territories created out of the public\r\ndomain increased between 1800 and 1830 from less than 60,000 to upward\r\nof 2,300,000 souls, constituting at the latter period about one-fifth\r\nof the whole people of the United States. The increase since can not\r\nbe accurately known, but the whole may now be safely estimated at\r\nover three and a half millions of souls, composing nine States, the\r\nrepresentatives of which constitute above one-third of the Senate and\r\nover one-sixth of the House of Representatives of the United States.\r\n\r\nThus has been formed a body of free and independent landholders with a\r\nrapidity unequaled in the history of mankind; and this great result has\r\nbeen produced without leaving anything for future adjustment between\r\nthe Government and its citizens. The system under which so much has\r\nbeen accomplished can not be intrinsically bad, and with occasional\r\nmodifications to correct abuses and adapt it to changes of circumstances\r\nmay, I think, be safely trusted for the future. There is in the\r\nmanagement of such extensive interests much virtue in stability; and\r\nalthough great and obvious improvements should not be declined, changes\r\nshould never be made without the fullest examination and the clearest\r\ndemonstration of their practical utility. In the history of the past we\r\nhave an assurance that this safe rule of action will not be departed\r\nfrom in relation to the public lands; nor is it believed that any\r\nnecessity exists for interfering with the fundamental principles of the\r\nsystem, or that the public mind, even in the new States, is desirous\r\nof any radical alterations. On the contrary, the general disposition\r\nappears to be to make such modifications and additions only as will the\r\nmore effectually carry out the original policy of filling our new States\r\nand Territories with an industrious and independent population.\r\n\r\nThe modification most perseveringly pressed upon Congress, which has\r\noccupied so much of its time for years past, and will probably do so\r\nfor a long time to come, if not sooner satisfactorily adjusted, is\r\na reduction in the cost of such portions of the public lands as are\r\nascertained to be unsalable at the rate now established by law, and a\r\ngraduation according to their relative value of the prices at which they\r\nmay hereafter be sold. It is worthy of consideration whether justice may\r\nnot be done to every interest in this matter, and a vexed question set\r\nat rest, perhaps forever, by a reasonable compromise of conflicting\r\nopinions. Hitherto, after being offered at public sale, lands have been\r\ndisposed of at one uniform price, whatever difference there might be in\r\ntheir intrinsic value. The leading considerations urged in favor of the\r\nmeasure referred to are that in almost all the land districts, and\r\nparticularly in those in which the lands have been long surveyed and\r\nexposed to sale, there are still remaining numerous and large tracts of\r\nevery gradation of value, from the Government price downward; that these\r\nlands will not be purchased at the Government price so long as better\r\ncan be conveniently obtained for the same amount; that there are large\r\ntracts which even the improvements of the adjacent lands will never\r\nraise to that price, and that the present uniform price, combined with\r\ntheir irregular value, operates to prevent a desirable compactness of\r\nsettlements in the new States and to retard the full development of that\r\nwise policy on which our land system is founded, to the injury not only\r\nof the several States where the lands lie, but of the United States as\r\na whole.\r\n\r\nThe remedy proposed has been a reduction of the prices according to the\r\nlength of time the lands have been in market, without reference to any\r\nother circumstances. The certainty that the efflux of time would not\r\nalways in such cases, and perhaps not even generally, furnish a true\r\ncriterion of value, and the probability that persons residing in the\r\nvicinity, as the period for the reduction of prices approached, would\r\npostpone purchases they would otherwise make, for the purpose of\r\navailing themselves of the lower price, with other considerations of a\r\nsimilar character, have hitherto been successfully urged to defeat the\r\ngraduation upon time.\r\n\r\nMay not all reasonable desires upon this subject be satisfied without\r\nencountering any of these objections? All will concede the abstract\r\nprinciple that the price of the public lands should be proportioned to\r\ntheir relative value, so far as can be accomplished without departing\r\nfrom the rule heretofore observed requiring fixed prices in cases of\r\nprivate entries. The difficulty of the subject seems to lie in the\r\nmode of ascertaining what that value is. Would not the safest plan\r\nbe that which has been adopted by many of the States as the basis of\r\ntaxation--an actual valuation of lands and classification of them into\r\ndifferent rates? Would it not be practicable and expedient to cause the\r\nrelative value of the public lands in the old districts which have been\r\nfor a certain length of time in market to be appraised and classed into\r\ntwo or more rates below the present minimum price by the officers now\r\nemployed in this branch of the public service or in any other mode\r\ndeemed preferable, and to make those prices permanent if upon the coming\r\nin of the report they shall prove satisfactory to Congress? Could not\r\nall the objects of graduation be accomplished in this way, and the\r\nobjections which have hitherto been urged against it avoided? It would\r\nseem to me that such a step, with a restriction of the sales to limited\r\nquantities and for actual improvement, would be free from all just\r\nexception.\r\n\r\nBy the full exposition of the value of the lands thus furnished and\r\nextensively promulgated persons living at a distance would be informed\r\nof their true condition and enabled to enter into competition with those\r\nresiding in the vicinity; the means of acquiring an independent home\r\nwould be brought within the reach of many who are unable to purchase at\r\npresent prices; the population of the new States would be made more\r\ncompact, and large tracts would be sold which would otherwise remain on\r\nhand. Not only would the land be brought within the means of a larger\r\nnumber of purchasers, but many persons possessed of greater means would\r\nbe content to settle on a larger quantity of the poorer lands rather\r\nthan emigrate farther west in pursuit of a smaller quantity of better\r\nlands. Such a measure would also seem to be more consistent with the\r\npolicy of the existing laws--that of converting the public domain into\r\ncultivated farms owned by their occupants. That policy is not best\r\npromoted by sending emigration up the almost interminable streams of\r\nthe West to occupy in groups the best spots of land, leaving immense\r\nwastes behind them and enlarging the frontier beyond the means of the\r\nGovernment to afford it adequate protection, but in encouraging it to\r\noccupy with reasonable denseness the territory over which it advances,\r\nand find its best defense in the compact front which it presents to\r\nthe Indian tribes. Many of you will bring to the consideration of the\r\nsubject the advantages of local knowledge and greater experience, and\r\nall will be desirous of making an early and final disposition of every\r\ndisturbing question in regard to this important interest. If these\r\nsuggestions shall in any degree contribute to the accomplishment of\r\nso important a result, it will afford me sincere satisfaction.\r\n\r\nIn some sections of the country most of the public lands have been sold,\r\nand the registers and receivers have very little to do. It is a subject\r\nworthy of inquiry whether in many cases two or more districts may not\r\nbe consolidated and the number of persons employed in this business\r\nconsiderably reduced. Indeed, the time will come when it will be the\r\ntrue policy of the General Government, as to some of the States, to\r\ntransfer to them for a reasonable equivalent all the refuse and unsold\r\nlands and to withdraw the machinery of the Federal land offices\r\naltogether. All who take a comprehensive view of our federal system and\r\nbelieve that one of its greatest excellences consists in interfering as\r\nlittle as possible with the internal concerns of the States look forward\r\nwith great interest to this result.\r\n\r\nA modification of the existing laws in respect to the prices of the\r\npublic lands might also have a favorable influence on the legislation\r\nof Congress in relation to another branch of the subject. Many who have\r\nnot the ability to buy at present prices settle on those lands with\r\nthe hope of acquiring from their cultivation the means of purchasing\r\nunder preemption laws from time to time passed by Congress. For this\r\nencroachment on the rights of the United States they excuse themselves\r\nunder the plea of their own necessities; the fact that they dispossess\r\nnobody and only enter upon the waste domain: that they give additional\r\nvalue to the public lands in their vicinity, and their intention\r\nultimately to pay the Government price. So much weight has from time to\r\ntime been attached to these considerations that Congress have passed\r\nlaws giving actual settlers on the public lands a right of preemption to\r\nthe tracts occupied by them at the minimum price. These laws have in all\r\ninstances been retrospective in their operation, but in a few years\r\nafter their passage crowds of new settlers have been found on the public\r\nlands for similar reasons and under like expectations, who have been\r\nindulged with the same privilege. This course of legislation tends to\r\nimpair public respect for the laws of the country. Either the laws to\r\nprevent intrusion upon the public lands should be executed, or, if that\r\nshould be impracticable or inexpedient, they should be modified or\r\nrepealed. If the public lands are to be considered as open to be\r\noccupied by any, they should by law be thrown open to all. That which is\r\nintended in all instances to be legalized should at once be made legal,\r\nthat those who are disposed to conform to the laws may enjoy at least\r\nequal privileges with those who are not. But it is not believed to be\r\nthe disposition of Congress to open the public lands to occupancy\r\nwithout regular entry and payment of the Government price, as such a\r\ncourse must tend to worse evils than the credit system, which it was\r\nfound necessary to abolish.\r\n\r\nIt would seem, therefore, to be the part of wisdom and sound policy\r\nto remove as far as practicable the causes which produce intrusions\r\nupon the public lands, and then take efficient steps to prevent them\r\nin future. Would any single measure be so effective in removing all\r\nplausible grounds for these intrusions as the graduation of price\r\nalready suggested? A short period of industry and economy in any part of\r\nour country would enable the poorest citizen to accumulate the means to\r\nbuy him a home at the lower prices, and leave him without apology for\r\nsettling on lands not his own. If he did not under such circumstances,\r\nhe would enlist no sympathy in his favor, and the laws would be readily\r\nexecuted without doing violence to public opinion.\r\n\r\nA large portion of our citizens have seated themselves on the public\r\nlands without authority since the passage of the last preemption law,\r\nand now ask the enactment of another to enable them to retain the lands\r\noccupied upon payment of the minimum Government price. They ask that\r\nwhich has been repeatedly granted before. If the future may be judged of\r\nby the past, little harm can be done to the interests of the Treasury\r\nby yielding to their request. Upon a critical examination it is found\r\nthat the lands sold at the public sales since the introduction of cash\r\npayments, in 1820, have produced on an average the net revenue of only\r\n6 cents an acre more than the minimum Government price. There is no\r\nreason to suppose that future sales will be more productive. The\r\nGovernment, therefore, has no adequate pecuniary interest to induce it\r\nto drive these people from the lands they occupy for the purpose of\r\nselling them to others.\r\n\r\nEntertaining these views, I recommend the passage of a preemption law\r\nfor their benefit in connection with the preparatory steps toward the\r\ngraduation of the price of the public lands, and further and more\r\neffectual provisions to prevent intrusions hereafter. Indulgence to\r\nthose who have settled on these lands with expectations that past\r\nlegislation would be made a rule for the future, and at the same time\r\nremoving the most plausible ground on which intrusions are excused and\r\nadopting more efficient means to prevent them hereafter, appears to me\r\nthe most judicious disposition which can be made of this difficult\r\nsubject. The limitations and restrictions to guard against abuses in\r\nthe execution of a preemption law will necessarily attract the careful\r\nattention of Congress, but under no circumstances is it considered\r\nexpedient to authorize floating claims in any shape. They have been\r\nheretofore, and doubtless would be hereafter, most prolific sources of\r\nfraud and oppression, and instead of operating to confer the favor of\r\nthe Government on industrious settlers are often used only to minister\r\nto a spirit of cupidity at the expense of the most meritorious of that\r\nclass.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying report of the Secretary of War will bring to your view\r\nthe state of the Army and all the various subjects confided to the\r\nsuperintendence of that officer.\r\n\r\nThe principal part of the Army has been concentrated in Florida, with a\r\nview and in the expectation of bringing the war in that Territory to a\r\nspeedy close. The necessity of stripping the posts on the maritime and\r\ninland frontiers of their entire garrisons for the purpose of assembling\r\nin the field an army of less than 4,000 men would seem to indicate the\r\nnecessity of increasing our regular forces; and the superior efficiency,\r\nas well as greatly diminished expense of that description of troops,\r\nrecommend this measure as one of economy as well as of expediency.\r\nI refer to the report for the reasons which have induced the Secretary\r\nof War to urge the reorganization and enlargement of the staff of the\r\nArmy, and of the Ordnance Corps, in which I fully concur.\r\n\r\nIt is not, however, compatible with the interests of the people to\r\nmaintain in time of peace a regular force adequate to the defense of\r\nour extensive frontiers. In periods of danger and alarm we must rely\r\nprincipally upon a well-organized militia, and some general arrangement\r\nthat will render this description of force more efficient has long\r\nbeen a subject of anxious solicitude. It was recommended to the First\r\nCongress by General Washington, and has been since frequently brought to\r\nyour notice, and recently its importance strongly urged by my immediate\r\npredecessor. The provision in the Constitution that renders it necessary\r\nto adopt a uniform system of organization for the militia throughout\r\nthe United States presents an insurmountable obstacle to an efficient\r\narrangement by the classification heretofore proposed, and I invite your\r\nattention to the plan which will be submitted by the Secretary of War,\r\nfor the organization of volunteer corps and the instruction of militia\r\nofficers, as more simple and practicable, if not equally advantageous,\r\nas a general arrangement of the whole militia of the United States.\r\n\r\nA moderate increase of the corps both of military and topographical\r\nengineers has been more than once recommended by my predecessor, and my\r\nconviction of the propriety, not to say necessity, of the measure, in\r\norder to enable them to perform the various and important duties imposed\r\nupon them, induces me to repeat the recommendation.\r\n\r\nThe Military Academy continues to answer all the purposes of its\r\nestablishment, and not only furnishes well-educated officers to the\r\nArmy, but serves to diffuse throughout the mass of our citizens\r\nindividuals possessed of military knowledge and the scientific\r\nattainments of civil and military engineering. At present the cadet is\r\nbound, with consent of his parents or guardians, to remain in service\r\nfive years from the period of his enlistment, unless sooner discharged,\r\nthus exacting only one year's service in the Army after his education is\r\ncompleted. This does not appear to me sufficient. Government ought to\r\ncommand for a longer period the services of those who are educated at\r\nthe public expense, and I recommend that the time of enlistment be\r\nextended to seven years, and the terms of the engagement strictly\r\nenforced.\r\n\r\nThe creation of a national foundry for cannon, to be common to the\r\nservice of the Army and Navy of the United States, has been heretofore\r\nrecommended, and appears to be required in order to place our ordnance\r\non an equal footing with that of other countries and to enable that\r\nbranch of the service to control the prices of those articles and\r\ngraduate the supplies to the wants of the Government, as well as to\r\nregulate their quality and insure their uniformity. The same reasons\r\ninduce me to recommend the erection of a manufactory of gunpowder, to\r\nbe under the direction of the Ordnance Office. The establishment of a\r\nmanufactory of small arms west of the Alleghany Mountains, upon the\r\nplan proposed by the Secretary of War, will contribute to extend\r\nthroughout that country the improvements which exist in establishments\r\nof a similar description in the Atlantic States, and tend to a much more\r\neconomical distribution of the armament required in the western portion\r\nof our Union.\r\n\r\nThe system of removing the Indians west of the Mississippi, commenced\r\nby Mr. Jefferson in 1804, has been steadily persevered in by every\r\nsucceeding President, and may be considered the settled policy of the\r\ncountry. Unconnected at first with any well-defined system for their\r\nimprovement, the inducements held out to the Indians were confined\r\nto the greater abundance of game to be found in the West; but when\r\nthe beneficial effects of their removal were made apparent a more\r\nphilanthropic and enlightened policy was adopted in purchasing their\r\nlands east of the Mississippi. Liberal prices were given and provisions\r\ninserted in all the treaties with them for the application of the funds\r\nthey received in exchange to such purposes as were best calculated to\r\npromote their present welfare and advance their future civilization.\r\nThese measures have been attended thus far with the happiest results.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen by referring to the report of the Commissioner of Indian\r\nAffairs that the most sanguine expectations of the friends and promoters\r\nof this system have been realized. The Choctaws, Cherokees, and other\r\ntribes that first emigrated beyond the Mississippi have for the most\r\npart abandoned the hunter state and become cultivators of the soil.\r\nThe improvement in their condition has been rapid, and it is believed\r\nthat they are now fitted to enjoy the advantages of a simple form of\r\ngovernment, which has been submitted to them and received their\r\nsanction; and I can not too strongly urge this subject upon the\r\nattention of Congress.\r\n\r\nStipulations have been made with all the Indian tribes to remove them\r\nbeyond the Mississippi, except with the bands of the Wyandots, the Six\r\nNations in New York, the Menomonees, Munsees, and Stockbridges in\r\nWisconsin, and Miamies in Indiana. With all but the Menomonees it is\r\nexpected that arrangements for their emigration will be completed the\r\npresent year. The resistance which has been opposed to their removal by\r\nsome of the tribes even after treaties had been made with them to that\r\neffect has arisen from various causes, operating differently on each\r\nof them. In most instances they have been instigated to resistance\r\nby persons to whom the trade with them and the acquisition of their\r\nannuities were important, and in some by the personal influence of\r\ninterested chiefs. These obstacles must be overcome, for the Government\r\ncan not relinquish the execution of this policy without sacrificing\r\nimportant interests and abandoning the tribes remaining east of the\r\nMississippi to certain destruction.\r\n\r\nThe decrease in numbers of the tribes within the limits of the States\r\nand Territories has been most rapid. If they be removed, they can be\r\nprotected from those associations and evil practices which exert so\r\npernicious and destructive an influence over their destinies. They\r\ncan be induced to labor and to acquire property, and its acquisition\r\nwill inspire them with a feeling of independence. Their minds can be\r\ncultivated, and they can be taught the value of salutary and uniform\r\nlaws and be made sensible of the blessings of free government and\r\ncapable of enjoying its advantages. In the possession of property,\r\nknowledge, and a good government, free to give what direction they\r\nplease to their labor, and sharers in the legislation by which their\r\npersons and the profits of their industry are to be protected and\r\nsecured, they will have an ever-present conviction of the importance of\r\nunion and peace among themselves and of the preservation of amicable\r\nrelations with us. The interests of the United States would also be\r\ngreatly promoted by freeing the relations between the General and State\r\nGovernments from what has proved a most embarrassing incumbrance by a\r\nsatisfactory adjustment of conflicting titles to lands caused by the\r\noccupation of the Indians, and by causing the resources of the whole\r\ncountry to be developed by the power of the State and General\r\nGovernments and improved by the enterprise of a white population.\r\n\r\nIntimately connected with this subject is the obligation of the\r\nGovernment to fulfill its treaty stipulations and to protect the Indians\r\nthus assembled \"at their new residences from all interruptions and\r\ndisturbances from any other tribes or nations of Indians or from any\r\nother person or persons whatsoever,\" and the equally solemn obligation\r\nto guard from Indian hostility its own border settlements, stretching\r\nalong a line of more than 1,000 miles. To enable the Government to\r\nredeem this pledge to the Indians and to afford adequate protection to\r\nits own citizens will require the continual presence of a considerable\r\nregular force on the frontiers and the establishment of a chain of\r\npermanent posts. Examinations of the country are now making, with a view\r\nto decide on the most suitable points for the erection of fortresses and\r\nother works of defense, the results of which will be presented to you by\r\nthe Secretary of War at an early day, together with a plan for the\r\neffectual protection of the friendly Indians and the permanent defense\r\nof the frontier States.\r\n\r\nBy the report of the Secretary of the Navy herewith communicated it\r\nappears that unremitted exertions have been made at the different\r\nnavy-yards to carry into effect all authorized measures for the\r\nextension and employment of our naval force. The launching and\r\npreparation of the ship of the line _Pennsylvania_ and the complete\r\nrepairs of the ships of the line _Ohio, Delaware_, and _Columbus_ may\r\nbe noticed as forming a respectable addition to this important arm\r\nof our national defense. Our commerce and navigation have received\r\nincreased aid, and protection during the present year. Our squadrons in\r\nthe Pacific and on the Brazilian station have been much increased, and\r\nthat in the Mediterranean, although small, is adequate to the present\r\nwants of our commerce in that sea. Additions have been made to our\r\nsquadron on the West India station, where the large force under\r\nCommodore Dallas has been most actively and efficiently employed in\r\nprotecting our commerce, in preventing the importation of slaves, and\r\nin cooperating with the officers of the Army in carrying on the war\r\nin Florida.\r\n\r\nThe satisfactory condition of our naval force abroad leaves at our\r\ndisposal the means of conveniently providing for a home squadron\r\nfor the protection of commerce upon our extensive coast. The amount\r\nof appropriations required for such a squadron will be found in the\r\ngeneral estimates for the naval service for the year 1838.\r\n\r\nThe naval officers engaged upon our coast survey have rendered important\r\nservice to our navigation. The discovery of a new channel into the\r\nharbor of New York, through which our largest ships may pass without\r\ndanger, must afford important commercial advantages to that harbor and\r\nadd greatly to its value as a naval station. The accurate survey of\r\nGeorges Shoals, off the coast of Massachusetts, lately completed, will\r\nrender comparatively safe a navigation hitherto considered dangerous.\r\n\r\nConsiderable additions have been made to the number of captains,\r\ncommanders, lieutenants, surgeons, and assistant surgeons in the Navy.\r\nThese additions were rendered necessary by the increased number of\r\nvessels put in commission to answer the exigencies of our growing\r\ncommerce.\r\n\r\nYour attention is respectfully invited to the various suggestions of the\r\nSecretary for the improvement of the naval service.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Postmaster-General exhibits the progress and condition\r\nof the mail service. The operations of the Post-Office Department\r\nconstitute one of the most active elements of our national prosperity,\r\nand it is gratifying to observe with what vigor they are conducted. The\r\nmail routes of the United States cover an extent of about 142,877 miles,\r\nhaving been increased about 37,103 miles within the last two years. The\r\nannual mail transportation on these routes is about 36,228,962 miles,\r\nhaving been increased about 10,359,476 miles within the same period. The\r\nnumber of post-offices has also been increased from 10,770 to 12,099,\r\nvery few of which receive the mails less than once a week, and a large\r\nportion of them daily. Contractors and postmasters in general are\r\nrepresented as attending to their duties with most commendable zeal and\r\nfidelity. The revenue of the Department within the year ending on the\r\n30th of June last was $4,137,056.59, and its liabilities accruing within\r\nthe same time were $3,380,847.75. The increase of revenue over that of\r\nthe preceding year was $708,166.41.\r\n\r\nFor many interesting details I refer you to the report of the\r\nPostmaster-General, with the accompanying papers, Your particular\r\nattention is invited to the necessity of providing a more safe and\r\nconvenient building for the accommodation of that Department.\r\n\r\nI lay before Congress copies of reports submitted in pursuance of\r\na call made by me upon the heads of Departments for such suggestions\r\nas their experience might enable them to make as to what further\r\nlegislative provisions may be advantageously adopted to secure the\r\nfaithful application of public moneys to the objects for which they\r\nare appropriated, to prevent their misapplication or embezzlement by\r\nthose intrusted with the expenditure of them, and generally to increase\r\nthe security of the Government against losses in their disbursement.\r\nIt is needless to dilate on the importance of providing such new\r\nsafeguards as are within the power of legislation to promote these\r\nends, and I have little to add to the recommendations submitted in the\r\naccompanying papers.\r\n\r\nBy law the terms of service of our most important collecting and\r\ndisbursing officers in the civil departments are limited to four years,\r\nand when reappointed their bonds are required to be renewed. The safety\r\nof the public is much increased by this feature of the law, and there\r\ncan be no doubt that its application to all officers intrusted with the\r\ncollection or disbursement of the public money, whatever may be the\r\ntenure of their offices, would be equally beneficial. I therefore\r\nrecommend, in addition to such of the suggestions presented by the heads\r\nof Departments as you may think useful, a general provision that all\r\nofficers of the Army or Navy, or in the civil departments, intrusted\r\nwith the receipt or payment of public money, and whose term of service\r\nis either unlimited or for a longer time than four years, be required to\r\ngive new bonds, with good and sufficient sureties, at the expiration of\r\nevery such period.\r\n\r\nA change in the period of terminating the fiscal year, from the 1st\r\nof October to the 1st of April, has been frequently recommended, and\r\nappears to be desirable.\r\n\r\nThe distressing casualties in steamboats which have so frequently\r\nhappened during the year seem to evince the necessity of attempting\r\nto prevent them by means of severe provisions connected with their\r\ncustomhouse papers. This subject was submitted to the attention of\r\nCongress by the Secretary of the Treasury in his last annual report,\r\nand will be again noticed at the present session, with additional\r\ndetails. It will doubtless receive that early and careful consideration\r\nwhich its pressing importance appears to require.\r\n\r\nYour attention has heretofore been frequently called to the affairs of\r\nthe District of Columbia, and I should not again ask it did not their\r\nentire dependence on Congress give them a constant claim upon its\r\nnotice. Separated by the Constitution from the rest of the Union,\r\nlimited in extent, and aided by no legislature of its own, it would seem\r\nto be a spot where a wise and uniform system of local government might\r\nhave been easily adopted. This District has, however, unfortunately\r\nbeen left to linger behind the rest of the Union. Its codes, civil\r\nand criminal, are not only very defective, but full of obsolete or\r\ninconvenient provisions. Being formed of portions of two States,\r\ndiscrepancies in the laws prevail in different parts of the territory,\r\nsmall as it is; and although it was selected as the seat of the General\r\nGovernment, the site of its public edifices, the depository of its\r\narchives, and the residence of officers intrusted with large amounts of\r\npublic property and the management of public business, yet it has never\r\nbeen subjected to or received that special and comprehensive legislation\r\nwhich these circumstances peculiarly demand. I am well aware of the\r\nvarious subjects of greater magnitude and immediate interest that press\r\nthemselves on the consideration of Congress, but I believe there is not\r\none that appeals more directly to its justice than a liberal and even\r\ngenerous attention to the interests of the District of Columbia and\r\na thorough and careful revision of its local government.\r\n\r\nM.

As the fifth section of the act of July 4, 1836,\r\nunder the authority of which this building has been commenced, provides\r\nonly for the erection of an edifice of such dimensions as may be\r\nrequired for the present and future accommodation of the Treasury\r\nDepartment, the size of the structure has been adapted to that purpose;\r\nand it is not contemplated to appropriate any part of the building to\r\nthe use of any other Department. As it is understood, however, that the\r\nplan of the edifice admits of its being completed either with or without\r\nwings, and that if Congress should think proper accommodation may be\r\nprovided by means of wings consistently with the harmony of the original\r\ndesign for the Department of State and the General Post-Office, it is\r\nnot thought that the public interest requires any change in the location\r\nor plan, although it is believed that the convenience of the public\r\nbusiness would be promoted by including in the building the proposed\r\naccommodations for the two other Departments just mentioned. The report\r\nof the architect shows the supposed difference of the expense that would\r\nbe incurred in the event of the construction of the building with wings,\r\nin taking down the edifice now occupied by the Department of State, or\r\nrepairing it so as to render it fireproof and make its outside conform\r\nto the other parts of the new building.\r\n\r\nI also transmit statements from the heads of the several Departments of\r\nthe number and size of the rooms that are necessary for their respective\r\nDepartments for office business and for the deposit of records.\r\n\r\nM.

Astor, of New York; that his interest\r\nwas sold to the British Northwest Company during the late war between\r\nthe United States and Great Britain; that this company held it, and were\r\nleft in possession at the time the country was formally delivered to the\r\nAmerican commissioners, and that this company afterwards united with and\r\nbecame a part of the Hudson Bay Company under that name, which company,\r\nit is believed, have from the period of such union occupied the post in\r\nquestion, now commonly called \"Fort George.\" The Hudson Bay Company have\r\nalso several depots situated on water courses in the interior of the\r\ncountry. The principal one is at Fort Vancouver, on the northern bank of\r\nthe Columbia River, about 80 or 100 miles from its mouth. It is known by\r\ninformation recently obtained that the English company have a steamboat\r\non this river, and that they have erected a sawmill and are cutting\r\ntimber on the territory claimed by the United States, and are shipping\r\nit in considerable quantities to the Sandwich Islands.\r\n\r\nThe original occupation was under the authority of the purchase of J.J.\r\nAstor's interest, and it has been continued under the provisions of the\r\nconventions of 1818 and 1827 with Great Britain. By the third article\r\nof the first of these conventions it is stipulated that the territory\r\nclaimed by either power westward of the Rocky Mountains shall be free\r\nand open for a term of years to the citizens and subjects of both. By\r\nthe second convention this stipulation is extended and continued in\r\nforce indefinitely, liable, however, to be annulled at any time after\r\nthe 20th of October, 1828, at the will of either party, on due notice\r\nof twelve months.\r\n\r\nRespectfully submitted,\r\n\r\nJOHN FORSYTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 5, 1838_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nRecent experience on the southern boundary of the United States and the\r\nevents now daily occurring on our northern frontier have abundantly\r\nshown that the existing laws are insufficient to guard against hostile\r\ninvasion from the United States of the territory of friendly and\r\nneighboring nations.\r\n\r\nThe laws in force provide sufficient penalties for the punishment of\r\nsuch offenses after they have been committed, and provided the parties\r\ncan be found, but the Executive is powerless in many cases to prevent\r\nthe commission of them, even when in possession of ample evidence of\r\nan intention on the part of evil-disposed persons to violate our laws.\r\n\r\nYour attention is called to this defect in our legislation. It is\r\napparent that the Executive ought to be clothed with adequate power\r\neffectually to restrain all persons within our jurisdiction from the\r\ncommission of acts of this character. They tend to disturb the peace\r\nof the country and inevitably involve the Government in perplexing\r\ncontroversies with foreign powers. I recommend a careful revision of all\r\nthe laws now in force and such additional enactments as may be necessary\r\nto vest in the Executive full power to prevent injuries being inflicted\r\nupon neighboring nations by the unauthorized and unlawful acts of\r\ncitizens of the United States or of other persons who may be within our\r\njurisdiction and subject to our control.\r\n\r\nIn illustration of these views and to show the necessity of early action\r\non the part of Congress, I submit herewith a copy of a letter received\r\nfrom the marshal of the northern district of New York, who had been\r\ndirected to repair to the frontier and take all authorized measures to\r\nsecure the faithful execution of existing laws.\r\n\r\nM. VAN BUREN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBUFFALO, _December 28, 1837_.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency M. VAN BUREN.\r\n\r\nSIR: This frontier is in a state of commotion. I came to this city on\r\nthe 22d instant, by direction of the United States attorney for the\r\nnorthern district of this State, for the purpose of serving process upon\r\nindividuals suspected of violating the laws of the United States enacted\r\nwith a view to maintain our neutrality. I learned on my arrival that\r\nsome 200 or 300 men, mostly from the district of country adjoining this\r\nfrontier and from this side of the Niagara, had congregated upon Navy\r\nIsland (Upper Canada), and were there in arms, with Rensselaer van\r\nRensselaer, of Albany, at their head as commander in chief. From that\r\ntime to the present they have received constant accessions of men,\r\nmunitions of war, provisions, etc., from persons residing within the\r\nStates. Their whole force is now about 1,000 strong, and, as is said,\r\nare well supplied with arms, etc.\r\n\r\nWarrants have been issued in some cases, but no arrests have as yet been\r\neffected. This expedition was got up in this city soon after McKenzie's\r\narrival upon this side of the river, and the first company that landed\r\nupon the island were organized, partially at least, before they crossed\r\nfrom this side to the island.\r\n\r\nFrom all that I can see and learn I am satisfied that if the Government\r\ndeem it their duty to prevent supplies being furnished from this side to\r\nthe army on the island, and also the augmentation of their forces from\r\namong the citizens of the States, that an armed force stationed along\r\nupon the line of the Niagara will be absolutely necessary to its\r\naccomplishment.\r\n\r\nI have just received a communication from Colonel McNab, commanding His\r\nMajesty's forces now at Chippewa, in which he strongly urges the public\r\nauthorities here to prevent supplies being furnished to the army on the\r\nisland, at the same time stating that if this can be effected the whole\r\naffair could be closed without any effusion of blood.\r\n\r\nMcNab is about 2,500 strong and constantly increasing. I replied to\r\nhim that I should communicate with you immediately, as also with the\r\ngovernor of this State, and that everything which could would be done\r\nto maintain a strict neutrality.\r\n\r\nI learn that persons here are engaged in dislodging one or more\r\nsteamboats from the ice, and, as is supposed, with a view to aid in the\r\npatriot expedition.\r\n\r\nI am, sir, with great consideration, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nN.

Every precaution was therefore\r\ntaken on our part authorized by the existing laws, and as the troops of\r\nthe Provinces were embodied on the Canadian side it was hoped that no\r\nserious violation of the rights of the United States would be permitted\r\nto occur. I regret, however, to inform you that an outrage of a most\r\naggravated character has been committed, accompanied by a hostile though\r\ntemporary invasion of our territory, producing the strongest feelings of\r\nresentment on the part of our citizens in the neighborhood and on the\r\nwhole border line, and that the excitement previously existing has been\r\nalarmingly increased. To guard against the possible recurrence of any\r\nsimilar act I have thought it indispensable to call out a portion of the\r\nmilitia, to be posted on that frontier. The documents herewith presented\r\nto Congress show the character of the outrage committed, the measures\r\ntaken in consequence of its occurrence, and the necessity for resorting\r\nto them.\r\n\r\nIt will also be seen that the subject was immediately brought to the\r\nnotice of the British minister accredited to this country, and the\r\nproper steps taken on our part to obtain the fullest information of\r\nall the circumstances leading to and attendant upon the transaction,\r\npreparatory to a demand for reparation. I ask such appropriations as the\r\ncircumstances in which our country is thus unexpectedly placed require.\r\n\r\nM.

Everything that can be done will be by the public\r\nauthorities to prevent so injudicious a movement.

Fire! fire!\"; that the _Caroline_\r\nwas abandoned without resistance, and the only effort made by either the\r\ncrew or passengers seemed to be to escape slaughter; that this deponent\r\nnarrowly escaped, having received several wounds, none of which,\r\nhowever, are of a serious character; that immediately after the\r\n_Caroline_ fell into the hands of the armed force who boarded her she\r\nwas set on fire, cut loose from the dock, was towed into the current of\r\nthe river, there abandoned, and soon after descended the Niagara Falls;\r\nthat this deponent has made vigilant search after the individuals,\r\nthirty-three in number, who are known to have been on the _Caroline_ at\r\nthe time she was boarded, and twenty-one only are to be found, one of\r\nwhich, to wit, Amos Durfee, of Buffalo, was found dead upon the dock,\r\nhaving received a shot from a musket, the ball of which penetrated the\r\nback part of the head and came out at the forehead; James H. King and\r\nCaptain C.F. Harding were seriously though not mortally wounded; several\r\nothers received slight wounds; the twelve individuals who are missing,\r\nthis deponent has no doubt, were either murdered upon the steamboat or\r\nfound a watery grave in the cataract of the Falls; and this deponent\r\nfurther says that immediately after the _Caroline_ was got into the\r\ncurrent of the stream and abandoned, as before stated, beacon lights\r\nwere discovered upon the Canada shore near Chippewa, and after\r\nsufficient time had elapsed to enable the boats to reach that shore this\r\ndeponent distinctly heard loud and vociferous cheering at that point;\r\nthat this deponent has no doubt that the individuals who boarded the\r\n_Caroline_ were a part of the British forces now stationed at Chippewa.\r\n\r\n[Subscribed and sworn to before a commissioner, etc.]\r\n\r\nSTATE OF NEW YORK, _Niagara County, ss_:\r\n\r\nCharles F.

I can\r\ngive you, therefore, no instructions on that subject, but request that\r\nyou will use your influence to prevent such excesses and to preserve the\r\ncharacter of this Government for good faith and a proper regard for the\r\nrights of friendly powers.\r\n\r\nThe militia will be called into the service for three months, unless\r\nsooner discharged, and in your requisitions you will designate the\r\nnumber of men and take care that the officers do not exceed a due\r\nproportion.\r\n\r\nIt is deemed important that the administrative branch of the service\r\nshould be conducted wherever practicable by officers of the Regular\r\nArmy.\r\n\r\nThe disposition of the force with regard to the points to be occupied is\r\nconfided to your discretion, military skill, and intimate knowledge of\r\nthe country; and the amount of that force must depend upon the character\r\nand duration of the contest now going on in Canada and the disposition\r\nmanifested by the people and the public authorities of that colony.\r\n\r\nThe President indulges a hope that outrages similar to that which lately\r\noccurred at Schlosser will not be repeated, and that you will be able to\r\nmaintain the peace of that frontier without being called upon to use the\r\nforce which has been confided to you.\r\n\r\nVery respectfully, your most obedient servant,\r\n\r\nJ.R.

The destruction of the property and assassination of citizens\r\nof the United States on the soil of New York at the moment when, as is\r\nwell known to you, the President was anxiously endeavoring to allay the\r\nexcitement and earnestly seeking to prevent any unfortunate occurrence\r\non the frontier of Canada has produced upon his mind the most painful\r\nemotions of surprise and regret. It will necessarily form the subject of\r\na demand for redress upon Her Majesty's Government. This communication\r\nis made to you under the expectation that through your instrumentality\r\nan early explanation may be obtained from the authorities of Upper\r\nCanada of all the circumstances of the transaction, and that by your\r\nadvice to those authorities such decisive precautions may be used as\r\nwill render the perpetration of similar acts hereafter impossible.\r\nNot doubting the disposition of the government of Upper Canada to do\r\nits duty in punishing the aggressors and preventing future outrage,\r\nthe President, notwithstanding, has deemed it necessary to order\r\na sufficient force on the frontier to repel any attempt of a like\r\ncharacter, and to make known to you that if it should occur he can not\r\nbe answerable for the effects of the indignation of the neighboring\r\npeople of the United States.\r\n\r\nI take this occasion to renew to you the assurance of my distinguished\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nJOHN FORSYTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 12, 1838_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to Congress copies of a representation from a late grand jury\r\nof the county of Washington, in this District, concurred in by two of\r\nthe judges of the circuit court, of the necessity of the erection of a\r\nnew jail and a lunatic asylum in this city. I also transmit copies of\r\ncertain proceedings of the circuit court for the county of Alexandria at\r\nthe last October term, and of a representation of the grand jury, made\r\nwith the approbation of the court, showing the unsafe condition of the\r\ncourt-house of that county and the necessity for a new one.\r\n\r\nI recommend these objects to the favorable consideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nM.

Greely, esq., a citizen of Maine,\r\nwhile employed within its limits and under its authority in taking an\r\nenumeration of the inhabitants of the county of Penobscot, has been\r\narrested a second time by the provincial authorities of New Brunswick,\r\nand is now in confinement in the jail at Frederickton; and requesting\r\nthat prompt measures be adopted by the Government of the United States\r\nto effect the release of Mr. Greely.\r\n\r\nI hasten to assure you in reply that Mr. Stevenson, the minister of the\r\nUnited States at London, will be immediately instructed to renew his\r\napplication to the British Government for the release of Mr. Greely, and\r\nthat the result, when obtained and communicated to this Department, will\r\nbe made known to your excellency without unnecessary delay.\r\n\r\nInformation was given at an early day to the executive of Maine of the\r\ninformal arrangement between the United States and Great Britain in\r\nregard to the exercise of jurisdiction within the disputed territory,\r\nand the President's desire was then expressed that the government and\r\npeople of that State would cooperate with the Federal Government in\r\ncarrying it into effect. In the letter addressed to your excellency from\r\nthis Department on the 17th ultimo you were informed of the continuance\r\nof that arrangement and of the reasons for it. I am now instructed by\r\nthe President (who indulges the confident expectation that the executive\r\nof Maine will still see in the gravity of the interests involved a\r\nsufficient motive for his cordial concurrence in an arrangement which\r\noffers the best prospect of an amicable and satisfactory adjustment\r\nof the general question of boundary) to request your excellency's\r\ncooperation in the conciliatory course adopted by the two Governments,\r\nan adherence to which seems the more important at this time from the\r\nconsideration that an answer to the President's last proposition is\r\ndaily looked for, and to renew to you the assurance that no efforts\r\nshall be spared on his part to bring the negotiation to a speedy\r\nconclusion.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, etc.,\r\n\r\nJOHN FORSYTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Forsyth to Mr. Stevenson_.\r\n\r\n[Extract.]\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE,\r\n\r\n_Washington, July 12, 1837_.\r\n\r\nANDREW STEVENSON, Esq., etc.\r\n\r\nSIR: I inclose an extract[11] of a letter received at this Department\r\nfrom the governor of Maine, by which you will perceive that a citizen of\r\nthat State, named Ebenezer S. Greely, while employed, in virtue of an\r\nappointment under one of its laws, in making an enumeration of the\r\ninhabitants upon a part of the territory claimed as being within the\r\nlimits of the State, was seized by order of the authorities of the\r\nProvince of New Brunswick on the 6th of June last and imprisoned in the\r\npublic jail of Frederickton, where he still remains. I also transmit a\r\ncopy of sundry documents relating to his arrest and detention.[12] This\r\noutrage upon the personal liberty of one of its citizens has actually\r\ncaused great excitement in Maine, and has produced an urgent appeal to\r\nthe General Government for its intervention in procuring redress for\r\nwhat is considered an unprovoked and unjustifiable aggression. This\r\narrest was made on a part of the territory in dispute between the\r\nUnited States and Great Britain, and could only have been justified in\r\nthe existing state of that controversy by some plain infringement of\r\nthe understanding which exists between the parties, that until the\r\nsettlement of the question of right there shall be no extension of\r\njurisdiction on either side within the disputed limits. It is not\r\nperceived how the simple enumeration of the inhabitants, about which\r\nMr. Greely was employed, could be construed as a breach of that\r\nunderstanding, and it is expected that the Government of Great Britain\r\nwill promptly mark its disapproval of this act of violence committed\r\nby the provincial authorities, so inconsistent with those amicable\r\nfeelings under which the negotiation respecting the controverted\r\nboundary has been hitherto conducted, and so essential to bring it\r\nto a happy termination. You are directed immediately upon the receipt\r\nof this dispatch to bring the subject to the notice of His Majesty's\r\nGovernment, and to demand as a matter of justice and right the prompt\r\nrelease of Mr. Greely and a suitable indemnity for his imprisonment.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: Omitted.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: Omitted.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Stevenson to Mr. Forsyth_.\r\n\r\n[Extract.]\r\n\r\n\r\nLEGATION OF THE UNITED STATES,\r\n\r\n_London, August 21, 1837_.\r\n\r\nSIR: I received by the last packet to Liverpool your dispatch of the\r\n12th of July (No. 21), transmitting copies of the documents and\r\ncorrespondence in relation to the arrest and imprisonment of Mr. Greely,\r\na citizen of Maine, by the authorities of New Brunswick.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of your instructions, I lost no time in presenting the\r\nsubject to the consideration of the Government, and herewith transmit\r\nto you a copy of my note to Lord Palmerston, to which no answer has yet\r\nbeen received.\r\n\r\nYou will see that I waived for the present the discussion of the\r\nquestion of right and jurisdiction, and contented myself with presenting\r\nthe facts of the case and demanding the immediate release of Mr. Greely\r\nand indemnity for the injuries which he had sustained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Stevenson to Lord Palmerston_.\r\n\r\n23 PORTLAND PLACE, _August 10, 1837_.\r\n\r\nLORD PALMERSTON, etc.:\r\n\r\nThe undersigned, envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary from\r\nthe United States, has the honor, in pursuance of instructions from his\r\nGovernment, to transmit to Lord Palmerston, Her Majesty's principal\r\nsecretary of state for foreign affairs, copies of sundry official\r\ndocuments detailing the circumstances under which a most unwarrantable\r\noutrage has recently been committed by the authorities of the Province\r\nof New Brunswick upon the rights and liberty of a citizen of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nFrom these papers it appears that Ebenezer S. Greely, a citizen of\r\nthe State of Maine, was duly appointed for the purpose of taking\r\nan enumeration of the inhabitants of that State by an act of its\r\nlegislature; that on the 6th of June last, whilst Mr. Greely was engaged\r\nin performing this duty and taking down the names of the inhabitants\r\nresiding in that part of the disputed territory claimed by the United\r\nStates as lying within the limits of Maine, he was forcibly arrested by\r\nthe authorities of New Brunswick, immediately transported in custody to\r\nthe town of Frederickton, and imprisoned in the public jail, where he\r\nstill remains. This proceeding by the authorities of New Brunswick,\r\nhaving produced, as might justly have been expected, very deep\r\nexcitement in Maine, was followed by an immediate appeal from the\r\ngovernor of that State to the Government of the United States for\r\nintervention and redress.\r\n\r\nThis application on the part of Maine having received the special\r\nconsideration of the President, the undersigned has been instructed\r\nto lose no time in presenting the subject to the early and earnest\r\nattention of Her Majesty's Government, and demanding not only the\r\nimmediate liberation of Mr. Greely from imprisonment, but indemnity\r\nfor the injuries that he has sustained.\r\n\r\nIn fulfilling these instructions of his Government it is not the\r\npurpose of the undersigned to open the general discussion of the\r\nrespective claims of Great Britain and the United States to the disputed\r\nterritory (within which Mr. Greely was arrested), or the right of either\r\nGovernment to exercise jurisdiction within its limits. Whatever opinion\r\nthe undersigned may entertain as to the rightful claim of the State of\r\nMaine to the territory in dispute, and however unanswerable he may\r\nregard the arguments by which the claim may be sustained, he deems\r\nit neither proper nor needful to urge them upon the consideration of\r\nHer Majesty's Government in the decision of the present case; more\r\nespecially as the whole subject is elsewhere, and in another form,\r\nmatter of negotiation between the two Governments, where the discussion\r\nof the question of right more appropriately belongs. The undersigned,\r\nmoreover, does not presume that pending the negotiation, and whilst\r\nefforts are making for the peaceable and final adjustment of these\r\ndelicate and exciting questions, Her Majesty's Government can claim\r\nthe right of exclusive jurisdiction and sovereignty over the disputed\r\nterritory or the persons residing within its limits. In such a claim of\r\npower on the part of Great Britain or its provincial authorities, the\r\nundersigned need not repeat to Lord Palmerston (what he is already fully\r\napprised of) the Government of the United States can never consent to\r\nacquiesce in the existing state of the controversy. On the contrary,\r\nthe mutual understanding which exists between the two Governments on\r\nthe subject and the moderation which both Governments have heretofore\r\nmanifested forbid the exercise by either of such high acts of sovereign\r\npower as that which has been exerted in the present case by the\r\nauthorities of Her Majesty's provincial government.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned must therefore suppose that this arrest and imprisonment\r\nof an American citizen under such circumstances and in the existing\r\nstate of the controversy could only have been justified by some supposed\r\ninfringement of the understanding existing between the parties in\r\nrelation to the question of jurisdiction within the disputed territory.\r\nSuch, however, was not the case. The correspondence between the governor\r\nof Maine and the lieutenant-governor of New Brunswick shows that\r\nthe only act done by Mr. Greely was the simple enumeration of the\r\ninhabitants, and it is not perceived how such an act could be construed\r\ninto a breach of the understanding between the two Governments.\r\n\r\nIt is proper also to remark that this was not the first time that the\r\ninhabitants within this particular settlement had been enumerated under\r\nthe authority of the United States. It was done in the census of 1820\r\n(as a portion of the State of Maine), and was at the time neither\r\nobjected to nor remonstrated against by the British Government or that\r\nof New Brunswick.\r\n\r\nWherever, then, the right of jurisdiction and sovereignty over this\r\nterritory may dwell, the undersigned feels satisfied that Her Majesty's\r\nGovernment can not fail to perceive that the arrest and imprisonment of\r\nMr. Greely under the circumstances of the case was not only a violation\r\nof the rights of the United States, but was wholly irreconcilable with\r\nthat moderation and forbearance which it is peculiarly the duty of both\r\nGovernments to maintain until the question of right shall be\r\ndefinitively settled.\r\n\r\nIt becomes the duty of the undersigned, therefore, in pursuance of\r\nspecial instructions from his Government, to invite the early and\r\nfavorable consideration of Her Majesty's Government to the subject, and\r\nto demand, as a matter of justice and right, the immediate discharge of\r\nMr. Greely from imprisonment, and a suitable indemnity for the wrongs\r\nhe has sustained.\r\n\r\nBefore closing this note the undersigned will avail himself of the\r\noccasion to remind Lord Palmerston of the urgency which exists for the\r\nimmediate and final adjustment of this long-pending controversy, and the\r\nincreased obstacles which will be thrown in the way of its harmonious\r\nsettlement by these repeated collisions of authority and the exercise of\r\nexclusive jurisdiction by either party within the disputed territory.\r\n\r\nHe begs leave also to repeat to his lordship assurances of the earnest\r\nand unabated desire which the President feels that the controversy\r\nshould be speedily and amicably settled, and to express the anxiety\r\nwith which the Government of the United States is waiting the promised\r\ndecision of Her Majesty's Government upon the proposition submitted\r\nto it as far back as July, 1836, and which the undersigned had been\r\nled to believe would long since have been given; and he has been\r\nfurther directed to say that should this proposition be disapproved\r\nthe President entertains the hope that some new one on the part of\r\nHer Majesty's Government will immediately be made for the final and\r\nfavorable termination of this protracted and deeply exciting\r\ncontroversy.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned begs Lord Palmerston to receive renewed assurances of\r\nhis distinguished consideration.\r\n\r\nA.

Greely, esq., a citizen of that State,\r\nwhile employed within its limits and under its authority in enumerating\r\nthe inhabitants of Penobscot County, has been again arrested and\r\nimprisoned by the provincial authorities of New Brunswick, and requests\r\nthat speedy measures be adopted by the Government of the United States\r\nto procure the release of Mr. Greely.\r\n\r\nGovernor Dunlap has been assured, by the President's direction, that\r\nsteps would be immediately taken to effect that object, and you are\r\naccordingly instructed, on the receipt of this dispatch, to bring the\r\nsubject without delay to the attention of the British secretary of state\r\nfor foreign affairs. You will remonstrate in a respectful but earnest\r\nmanner against this second violation of the rights of Maine in the\r\nperson of her agent, and demand the prompt release of Mr. Greely, with\r\nsuch additional indemnification as the nature of the outrage calls for.\r\n\r\nI am, etc.,\r\n\r\nJOHN FORSYTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Stevenson to Mr. Forsyth_.\r\n\r\n[Extracts.]\r\n\r\nLEGATION OF THE UNITED STATES,\r\n\r\n_London, November 22, 1837_.\r\n\r\nOn my return to London, after an absence of a few weeks, I found your\r\ndispatches Nos. 26 and 27, under date of the 8th and 28th of September.\r\nIn pursuance of your instructions I addressed an official note to Lord\r\nPalmerston on the subject of the second arrest and imprisonment of Mr.\r\nGreely by the provincial authority of New Brunswick, a copy of which\r\nI have now the honor of transmitting to you.\r\n\r\nNo answer has yet been received to my first note, but I presume a\r\ndecision of the case may be soon expected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Stevenson to Lord Palmerston_.\r\n\r\n23 PORTLAND PLACE, _November 8, 1837_.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned, envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary\r\nfrom the United States, had the honor on the 10th of August last\r\nof addressing to Lord Viscount Palmerston, Her Majesty's principal\r\nsecretary of state for foreign affairs, an official note complaining\r\nof the arrest and imprisonment of Ebenezer S. Greely, a citizen of\r\nthe United States, by the provincial authorities of New Brunswick,\r\nand demanding, by order of his Government, the immediate release of\r\nMr. Greely from imprisonment, with suitable indemnity for the wrongs\r\nhe had sustained. To this communication a note was received from his\r\nlordship, under date of the 22d of the same month, in which an assurance\r\nwas given that an early answer to the complaint might be expected.\r\nNo answer, however, has yet been received, and it is with unfeigned\r\nregret that the undersigned finds himself constrained, in again inviting\r\nthe attention of Her Majesty's Government to the subject, to accompany\r\nit with another complaint of a second outrage committed by the\r\nauthorities of New Brunswick upon the rights and liberty of this\r\nindividual.\r\n\r\nFrom recent information received it appears that shortly after the first\r\narrest and imprisonment of Mr. Greely he was, by the orders of the\r\nlieutenant-governor of New Brunswick, released from confinement, but\r\nwas immediately thereafter again taken into custody by his authority and\r\nrecommitted to the jail of Frederickton, where he is now detained. This\r\nfact having been communicated by the governor of Maine to the President\r\nof the United States (in an official communication setting forth the\r\ncircumstances under which it was done, a copy of which is herewith\r\ntransmitted), the undersigned has received the special instructions of\r\nhis Government to bring the subject without delay to the notice of Her\r\nMajesty's Government, in order that immediate steps may be taken for\r\nthe liberation of Mr. Greely and indemnity made for the injuries he\r\nhas suffered.\r\n\r\nHaving in the first note which he had the honor of addressing to Lord\r\nPalmerston stated the grounds upon which the release of this individual\r\nwas demanded and the expectations of his Government in relation to the\r\nsubject, and having waived the discussion of the questions of right and\r\njurisdiction, which he still intends doing, it will not be needful to do\r\nmore on this occasion than express to his lordship the painful surprise\r\nand regret with which the President has received information of this\r\nsecond outrage on the part of the authorities of New Brunswick, and\r\nto repeat the assurances heretofore given that such proceeding can\r\nbe regarded in no other light than a violation of the rights and\r\nsovereignty of the United States, and entirely irreconcilable with that\r\nmutual forbearance which it was understood would be practiced by both\r\nGovernments pending the negotiation.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances under which these recent attempts to enforce\r\njurisdiction have been made show that in the most favorable aspect in\r\nwhich they can be regarded they were wholly indefensible.\r\n\r\nThe act for which Greely was arrested and imprisoned, so far from having\r\nbeen committed within the acknowledged dominions of the British Crown,\r\nand beyond the limits of the disputed territory, and therefore liable\r\nto be treated as a violation of territorial jurisdiction, took place,\r\nas appears by the statement of the governor of Maine, whilst he was\r\nemployed within the limits of that State, and under its authority,\r\nin enumerating the inhabitants of the county of Penobscot.\r\n\r\nBy what authority, then, the provincial government of New Brunswick\r\nfelt itself justified in exercising such acts of sovereign power the\r\nundersigned is at a loss to conceive, unless, indeed, upon the ground\r\nthat the jurisdiction and sovereignty over the disputed territory\r\npending the controversy rests exclusively with Great Britain. If such\r\nshould turn out to be the fact, it can hardly be necessary again to\r\nrepeat the assurances which have been heretofore given that in any such\r\nclaim of power the Government of the United States can not acquiesce.\r\n\r\nUpon the consequences which would unavoidably result from attempting to\r\nexercise such jurisdiction it is needless to enlarge. It must now be\r\napparent that all such attempts, if persevered in, can produce only\r\nfeuds and collisions of the most painful character, and besides\r\nincreasing the feelings of international discord which have already been\r\nexcited between the contending parties, they will close every avenue to\r\nan amicable adjustment of a controversy which it is so much the desire\r\nand interest of both Governments to accomplish. Ought it not, then, to\r\nbe the earnest endeavor of the two Governments to avoid doing anything\r\nwhich can have a tendency to lead to such mischievous consequences?\r\n\r\nIt is under this view of the subject that the undersigned has been\r\ninstructed again to remonstrate against these proceedings of the\r\nauthorities of New Brunswick, as a violation of the rights of Maine\r\nin the person of her agent, and to protest in the most solemn manner\r\nagainst the future exercise of all such acts of jurisdiction and\r\nsovereignty over the disputed territory or the citizens of the United\r\nStates residing within its limits until a final adjustment of the\r\ncontroversy takes place.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned, therefore, can not and ought not to close this note\r\nwithout again invoking the early and earnest attention of Lord\r\nPalmerston and that of Her Majesty's Government to this painful subject.\r\n\r\nIt is one of deep and mutual interest to the parties concerned, and the\r\ndelicacy and embarrassments which surround it are justly appreciated by\r\nthe Government of the United States. Deeply regretting, as that\r\nGovernment does, the collisions of authority to which both countries\r\nhave been so repeatedly exposed by the delay that has taken place in the\r\nfinal settlement of the main question, it is sincerely desirous, as the\r\nundersigned has taken occasion repeatedly to assure Lord Palmerston, to\r\nhave it brought to a speedy and amicable termination. This can only be\r\ndone by measures of mutual forbearance and moderation on the part of\r\nboth Governments. To this end the efforts of the American Government\r\nhave been earnest, persevering, and constant. It has done, as it will\r\ncontinue to do, everything in its power to induce the State of Maine to\r\npursue a course best calculated to avoid all excitement and collision\r\nbetween the citizens of that State and the inhabitants of New Brunswick,\r\nor which would tend in any manner to embarrass the mediatorial action of\r\ntheir two Governments on the subject; but it can not be expected, if the\r\nauthorities of New Brunswick still persevere in attempting to exercise\r\njurisdiction over the disputed territory by the arrest and imprisonment\r\nin foreign jails of citizens of Maine for performing their duty under\r\nthe laws of their own State, and within what is believed to be her\r\nterritorial limits, that measures of retaliation will not be resorted\r\nto by Maine, and great mischief ensue.\r\n\r\nIndeed, under existing circumstances and in the nature of human\r\nconnections, it is not possible, should such a course of violence be\r\ncontinued, to avoid collisions of the most painful character, for which\r\nthe Government of the United States can not be responsible, but which\r\nboth Governments would equally deplore.\r\n\r\nIt was doubtless with a view of guarding against these consequences that\r\nthe understanding took place that each Government should abstain from\r\nexercising jurisdiction within the limits of the disputed territory\r\npending the settlement of the main question.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned therefore persuades himself that these proceedings\r\nof the colonial government may have taken place without a careful\r\nexamination of the important questions involved in them or the\r\nconsequences to which they might lead, rather than under instructions\r\nfrom Her Majesty's Government or with a deliberate view of asserting\r\nand enforcing territorial and jurisdictional rights over the contested\r\nterritory.\r\n\r\nIn looking back, as he does with satisfaction, to the conciliatory\r\nspirit in which the negotiation has heretofore been conducted and the\r\nmoderation which both Governments have observed, the undersigned can not\r\npermit himself to doubt but that upon a careful review of the whole\r\nsubject Her Majesty's Government will see fit not only to mark with its\r\ndisapprobation this last proceeding of her colonial government, and\r\ndirect the immediate liberation of Mr. Greely from imprisonment, with\r\nample indemnity for the wrongs he may have sustained, but that it will\r\nsee the propriety of giving suitable instructions to the authorities of\r\nNew Brunswick to abstain for the future from all acts of that character,\r\nwhich can have no other tendency than to increase the excitement and\r\njealousies which already prevail and retard the final and amicable\r\nadjustment of this painful controversy.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned requests Lord Palmerston to accept assurances of his\r\ndistinguished consideration.\r\n\r\nA. STEVENSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Clay to Mr. Vaughan_.\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE,\r\n\r\n_Washington, January 9, 1829_.\r\n\r\nRight Hon. CHARGES R. VAUGHAN, etc.\r\n\r\nSIR: I have this day received a letter from the governor of the State of\r\nMassachusetts, transmitting an extract from a letter addressed by George\r\nW. Coffin, esq., land agent of Massachusetts, to his excellency, a copy\r\nof which is herewith communicated, and to which I request your immediate\r\nand particular attention.\r\n\r\nIt appears from this document that \"mills are now erecting on the grant\r\nformerly made to General Baton, on the Aroostook River, for the avowed\r\npurpose of getting their supply of timber from our forests;\" that the\r\nproprietor of these mills \"says he has assurances from the authorities\r\nof New Brunswick that he may cut timber without hindrance from them,\r\nprovided he will engage to pay them for it if they succeed in obtaining\r\ntheir right to the territory;\" \"that mills are also erected at Fish\r\nRiver, and to supply them the growth in that section is fast\r\ndiminishing, and that the inhabitants of St. John River obtain from the\r\nProvince of New Brunswick permits to cut on the Crown lands. But it is\r\nevident that many having such permits do not confine themselves to Crown\r\nlands, for in my travels across the interior country logging roads and\r\nthe chips where timber had been hewn were seen in every direction,\r\nalso many stumps of trees newly cut.\" I need scarcely remark that the\r\nproceedings thus described are in opposition to the understanding which\r\nhas existed between the Governments of the United States and Great\r\nBritain that during the pendency of the arbitration which is to settle\r\nthe question of boundary neither party should exercise any jurisdiction\r\nor perform any act on the disputed territory to strengthen his own\r\nclaims or to affect the state of the property in issue. The governor of\r\nMassachusetts observes in his letter to me that, \"in relation to the\r\nlands on Fish River, it must be recollected that the survey of a road\r\nby the joint commissioners of Massachusetts and Maine a short time\r\nsince was made matter of complaint by the British minister resident at\r\nWashington on the express ground that the territory was within the scope\r\nof the dispute. From courtesy to his Government and a respectful regard\r\nto a suggestion from the Department of State, the making of the road\r\nwas suspended.\" The governor justly concludes: \"But it will be an ill\r\nrequital for this voluntary forbearance on our part if the land is to\r\nbe plundered of its timber and the value of the property destroyed\r\nbefore it shall be determined that it does not belong to us.\"\r\n\r\nIf the government of New Brunswick will authorize or countenance such\r\ntrespasses as have been stated by Mr. Coffin on the disputed territory,\r\nit can not be expected that the State of Maine will abstain from the\r\nadoption of preventive measures or from the performance of similar or\r\nother acts of jurisdiction and proprietorship. The consequence would be\r\nimmediate and disagreeable collision. To prevent this state of things,\r\nI am directed by the President again to demand through you the effectual\r\ninterposition of the British Government. Without that the friendly, if\r\nnot the peaceful, relations between the two countries may be interrupted\r\nor endangered. I request your acceptance on this occasion of assurances\r\nof my distinguished consideration.\r\n\r\nH. CLAY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Vaughan to Mr. Clay_.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 13, 1829_.\r\n\r\nHon. HENRY CLAY, etc.:\r\n\r\nThe undersigned, His Britannic Majesty's envoy extraordinary and\r\nminister plenipotentiary, has the honor to acknowledge the receipt of\r\nMr. Clay's note containing a representation which has been made by his\r\nexcellency the governor of the State of Massachusetts respecting the\r\ncutting down of timber upon the disputed territory in the Province of\r\nNew Brunswick.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned will immediately transmit a copy of Mr. Clay's note to\r\nHis Majesty's lieutenant-governor of New Brunswick, in order to obtain\r\nan explanation of the transaction which has given rise to the\r\nremonstrance made by the governor of Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned takes this opportunity of renewing to the Secretary of\r\nState the assurances of his highest consideration.\r\n\r\nCHS. R. VAUGHAN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Vaughan to Mr. Hamilton_.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 7, 1879_.\r\n\r\nJAMES A. HAMILTON, Esq., etc.:\r\n\r\nThe undersigned, His Britannic Majesty's envoy extraordinary and\r\nminister plenipotentiary, had the honor to receive from the Secretary\r\nof State of the United States a note, dated the 9th January last,\r\ncontaining a representation made by his excellency the governor of\r\nMassachusetts respecting some trespasses committed on the disputed\r\nterritory in the Province of New Brunswick.\r\n\r\nA copy of the note of the Secretary of State having been transmitted to\r\nSir Howard Douglas, His Majesty's lieutenant-governor of that Province,\r\nthe undersigned has lately received an answer, which he has the honor\r\nto communicate to Mr. Hamilton by inclosing an extract[13] of his\r\nexcellency's letter, which shews in the most satisfactory manner\r\nthat, so far from the proceedings complained of by the governor of\r\nMassachusetts having been authorized or countenanced in any shape by the\r\ngovernment of New Brunswick, every precaution has been taken to prevent\r\nand restrain depredations in the disputed territory.\r\n\r\nMr. Hamilton will see by the inclosed letter that Sir Howard Douglas has\r\nsent a magistrate to report upon the mills which have been established\r\nwithout license or authority, to inspect minutely the stations of the\r\ncutters of lumber, and to seize any timber brought into the acknowledged\r\nboundaries of New Brunswick from the disputed territory, and to hold the\r\nproceeds of the sale of it for the benefit of the party to whom that\r\nterritory may be ultimately awarded.\r\n\r\nAs the time is approaching when Sir Howard Douglas will be absent from\r\nhis government, he will leave injunctions strictly to observe the\r\nunderstanding between the two governments during his absence. The\r\nundersigned has great satisfaction in being able to offer to the\r\nGovernment of the United States the unequivocal testimony contained in\r\nthe inclosed letter from Sir Howard Douglas of the conciliatory spirit\r\nin which the government of New Brunswick is administered, and trusting\r\nthat a similar spirit will animate the government of the American States\r\nwhich border on that Province, he confidently anticipates a cessation of\r\nthat excitement which has unfortunately prevailed in the neighborhood of\r\nthe disputed territory.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned takes this occasion to offer to Mr. Hamilton the\r\nassurances of his high consideration.\r\n\r\nCHAS.

CHARLES RICHARD VAUGHAN,\r\n\r\n_Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary from Great Britain_.\r\n\r\nSIR: I have received and laid before the President of the United States\r\nthe note, with its inclosures, which you did me the honor to write to me\r\non the 7th of this month in answer to a representation which was made\r\nto you by Mr. Clay on the 9th of January last, at the instance of the\r\ngovernor of Massachusetts, concerning depredations complained of by him\r\nagainst inhabitants of the Province of New Brunswick in cutting timber,\r\npreparing lumber for market, and erecting mills upon the soil of the\r\nterritory in dispute between the United States and Great Britain,\r\nand I am directed by the President to state in reply, as I have\r\nmuch pleasure in doing, that he derives great satisfaction from the\r\ninformation contained in your communication, as he especially perceives\r\nin the prompt and energetic measures adopted by Sir Howard Douglas,\r\nlieutenant-governor of the Province in question, and detailed in the\r\ninclosure referred to, a pledge of the same disposition on the part\r\nof the authorities of that Province which animates this Government--to\r\nenforce a strict observance of the understanding between the two\r\nGovernments that the citizens or subjects of neither shall exercise\r\nany acts of ownership in the disputed territory whilst the title to it\r\nremains unsettled. I will lose no time in making known to the governors\r\nof Massachusetts and Maine the measures which have been thus adopted\r\nby the lieutenant-governor of New Brunswick to guard against all\r\ndepredations upon the disputed territory, and will at the same time\r\ninform their excellencies of the just and confident expectation\r\nentertained by the President that the conciliatory understanding or\r\narrangement between the two Governments of the United States and Great\r\nBritain already referred to should not be disturbed by the citizens of\r\nthese two States.\r\n\r\nI am directed likewise by the President expressly to use this first\r\noccasion of an official communication with you under his orders to\r\nrequest the favor of you to make known to your Government the sincere\r\nregret he feels at the existence of any difference or misunderstanding\r\nbetween the United States and Great Britain upon the subject-matter of\r\nthis letter, or any other whatever, and that in all the measures which\r\nmay be adopted on his part toward their adjustment he will be entirely\r\nactuated and governed by a sincere desire to promote the kindest and\r\nbest feelings on both sides and secure the mutual and lasting interests\r\nof the parties.\r\n\r\nI pray you, sir, to accept the renewed assurances of the high and\r\ndistinguished consideration with which I have the honor to be, your\r\nobedient, humble servant,\r\n\r\nJAMES A. HAMILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Vaughan to Mr. Hamilton_.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 12, 1839_.\r\n\r\nMr. J.A. HAMILTON, etc.:\r\n\r\nIt is with great satisfaction that the undersigned, His Britannic\r\nMajesty's envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary, acknowledges\r\nthe receipt of Mr. Hamilton's note of the 11th instant, containing\r\na prompt acknowledgment of the efficacious measures adopted by the\r\nlieutenant-governor of New Brunswick to investigate and to restrain the\r\nproceedings complained of in the disputed territory; and he begs leave\r\nto assure the President that he derives great satisfaction from being\r\nrequested to communicate to His Majesty's Government that in the\r\nadjustment of differences between Great Britain and the United States\r\nthe President will be entirely actuated and governed by a sincere desire\r\nto promote the kindest and best feelings on both sides and secure the\r\nmutual and lasting interests of the parties.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned begs Mr. Hamilton to accept the assurances of his\r\nhighest consideration.\r\n\r\nCHS. R. VAUGHAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Vaughan to Mr. Van Buren_.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _April 10, 1829_.\r\n\r\nHon. MARTIN VAN BUREN, etc.:\r\n\r\nThe undersigned, His Britannic Majesty's envoy extraordinary and\r\nminister plenipotentiary, has the honor to inform the Secretary of\r\nState of the United States that he has received an intimation from His\r\nMajesty's lieutenant-governor of New Brunswick that, apparently, it is\r\nthe intention of the Government of the United States to carry the road\r\nnow making through the State of Maine to Mars Hill over the point, and\r\nto occupy it as a military station.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned begs leave to remind Mr. Van Buren that Mars Hill is\r\nsituated upon the northeastern line of boundary which is in dispute\r\nbetween the two Governments; and he is called upon to protest against\r\nthe occupation of it by American troops upon the ground that the line\r\ndrawn by the commissioners of boundary under the treaty of Ghent due\r\nnorth from the monument which marks the sources of the river St. Croix\r\nwas not considered by them as correctly laid down, and it yet remains\r\nto be determined whether Mars Hill lies eastward or westward of a line\r\ndrawn upon scientific principles. For a better explanation of the\r\nmotives for this protest the undersigned has the honor to refer the\r\nSecretary of State to a copy of a letter, which is inclosed,[14] from\r\nSir Howard Douglas.\r\n\r\nA joint resolution of both Houses of Congress passed during the last\r\nsession tends to confirm the intentions of the Government of the United\r\nStates as inferred by Sir Howard Douglas from the information which he\r\nhas received. That resolution authorized the making of a road from and\r\nbeyond Mars Hill to the mouth of the Madawaska River; but as the\r\ncarrying into effect that resolution was left entirely to the discretion\r\nof the President, the undersigned can not entertain any apprehension of\r\na forcible seizure of a large portion of the disputed territory, which\r\na compliance with the resolution of Congress would imply.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned acknowledges with great satisfaction the assurances\r\nwhich he has received of the kind feelings which will actuate the\r\nPresident of the United States in the adjustment of any differences\r\nwhich may exist with Great Britain. He submits, therefore, the\r\nrepresentation of the lieutenant-governor of New Brunswick respecting\r\nthe occupation of Mars Hill, relying confidently on the manifest\r\npropriety of restraining the aggression which it is supposed is\r\nmeditated from the frontier of the State of Maine, and of both parties\r\nmutually abstaining from any acts which can affect the disputed\r\nterritory, as the question of possession is now in the course of\r\narbitration.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned reiterates to the Secretary of State the assurances of\r\nhis highest consideration.\r\n\r\nCHAS. R. VAUGHAN.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: Omitted.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Van Buren to Mr. Vaughan_.\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE,\r\n\r\n_Washington, May 11, 1829_.\r\n\r\nRight Hon. CHARGES R. VAUGHAN, etc.:\r\n\r\nThe undersigned, Secretary of State of the United States, has the honor\r\nto acknowledge the receipt of the note which Mr. Vaughan, His Britannic\r\nMajesty's envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary, addressed to\r\nhim on the 10th of April, stating upon the authority of a letter from\r\nthe governor of New Brunswick, whereof a copy came inclosed in Mr.\r\nVaughan's note, that it was apparently the intention of the Government\r\nof the United States to carry the road now making through the State\r\nof Maine to Mars Hill over that point, and to occupy Mars Hill as a\r\nmilitary station; and protesting against such occupation upon the ground\r\nthat the line drawn by the commissioners of boundary under the treaty of\r\nGhent due north from the monument which marks the source of the river\r\nSt. Croix was not considered by them as correctly laid down, and that it\r\nyet remains to be determined whether Mars Hill is eastward or westward\r\nof the true line.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned deems it unnecessary upon the present occasion to enter\r\ninto an elaborate discussion of the point stated by Sir Howard Douglas,\r\nthe lieutenant-governor of New Brunswick, concerning the line referred\r\nto by him, inasmuch as the relative position of Mars Hill to that line\r\nis already designated upon map A, and the line itself mutually agreed\r\nto and sufficiently understood for all present purposes, though not\r\ndefinitively settled by the convention of Condon of the 29th September,\r\n1827.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned will therefore merely state that he finds nothing\r\nin the record of the proceedings of the commissioners under the fifth\r\narticle of the treaty of Ghent to warrant the doubt suggested by the\r\nlieutenant-governor of New Brunswick whether Mars Hill lies to the\r\nwestward of the line to be drawn due north from the monument at the\r\nsource of the St. Croix to the highlands which divide the waters that\r\nempty into the river St. Lawrence from those which empty into the\r\nAtlantic Ocean; that the joint surveys and explorations made under that\r\ncommission place the hill about a mile due west of that line; and that\r\nthe agent of His Britannic Majesty before the commissioners, so far from\r\nintimating any doubt on the point, made it one ground of argument that\r\nthe true line, when correctly laid down, would necessarily, on account\r\nof the ascertained progressive westerly variation of the needle, fall\r\nstill farther westward.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned can not acquiesce in the supposition that, because the\r\nagent of His Britannic Majesty thought proper in the proceedings before\r\nthe commissioners to lay claim to all that portion of the State of\r\nMaine which lies north of a line running westerly from Mars Hill, and\r\ndesignated as the limit or boundary of the British claim, thereby the\r\nUnited States or the State of Maine ceased to have jurisdiction in the\r\nterritory thus claimed. In the view of this Government His Britannic\r\nMajesty's agent might with equal justice have extended his claim to any\r\nother undisputed part of the State as to claim the portion of it which\r\nhe has drawn in question, and in such case the lieutenant-governor of\r\nNew Brunswick could surely not have considered a continuance on the\r\npart of the United States and of the State of Maine to exercise their\r\naccustomed jurisdiction and authority to be an encroachment. If so,\r\nin what light are we to regard the continued acts of jurisdiction now\r\nexercised by him in the Madawaska settlement? More than twenty years ago\r\nlarge tracts of land lying westward of Mars Hill, and northward on the\r\nriver Restook, were granted by the State of Massachusetts, which tracts\r\nare held and possessed under those grants to this day, and the United\r\nStates and the States of Massachusetts and Maine, in succession, have\r\nnever ceased to exercise that jurisdiction which the unsettled condition\r\nof the country in that region and other circumstances admitted and\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned, therefore, can not discover in the facts and\r\ncircumstances of the case any just principles upon which Sir Howard\r\nDouglas could predicate his protest. He has, however, submitted the note\r\nwhich he had the honor to receive from Mr. Vaughan to the President of\r\nthe United States, and is by him directed to say in reply that although\r\nthis Government could feel no difficulty in the exercise of what it\r\ndeems an unquestionable right, and could not allow itself to be\r\nrestrained by the protest of the lieutenant-governor of New Brunswick,\r\nyet, as a further proof of the spirit of amity, forbearance, and\r\nconciliation which the President is desirous of cultivating between the\r\ntwo Governments, he has decided to postpone for the present the exercise\r\nof the authority vested in him by the Congress of the United States to\r\ncause to be surveyed and laid out a military road to be continued from\r\nMars Hill, or such other point on the military road laid out in the\r\nState of Maine as he may think proper, to the mouth of the river\r\nMadawaska, and to add that the lieutenant-governor of New Brunswick is\r\nunder a misapprehension as to the design of this Government to occupy\r\nMars Hill as a military station, no such intention being entertained by\r\nthe President, nor have any measures been taken by this Government with\r\nan ulterior view to that object.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned indulges the hope that Mr. Vaughan will perceive in the\r\nmanner in which the President, discriminating between the rights of this\r\nGovernment and their present exercise, has used the discretion conferred\r\nupon him an additional evidence of the desire which he sincerely\r\nentertains, and which he has heretofore caused to be communicated to\r\nMr. Vaughan, that both Governments should, as far as practicable,\r\nabstain from all acts of authority over the territory in dispute which\r\nare not of immediate and indispensable necessity, and which would serve\r\nto create or increase excitement whilst the matter is in course of\r\narbitration; and he feels well persuaded that Mr. Vaughan will not fail\r\nto inculcate the same spirit and to recommend in the strongest terms the\r\nobservance of the same course on the part of the provincial government\r\nof New Brunswick.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned offers to Mr. Vaughan the renewed assurances of his high\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nM.

MARTIN VAN BUREN, etc.:\r\n\r\nThe undersigned, His Britannic Majesty's envoy extraordinary and\r\nminister plenipotentiary, had the honor on the 7th March last to lay\r\nbefore the Government of the United States a letter from Sir Howard\r\nDouglas, His Majesty's lieutenant-governor of New Brunswick, in\r\nexplanation of trespasses alleged by the governor of the State of\r\nMassachusetts to have been committed by British subjects in the disputed\r\nterritory within that Province. The lieutenant-governor announced his\r\nintention in that letter of sending a magistrate into the district where\r\nthe proceedings complained of had taken place to ascertain the nature\r\nand extent of the alleged trespasses and afterwards to make a report\r\nto his excellency.\r\n\r\nThe report of the magistrate having been received by Mr. Black, who has\r\nbeen commissioned by His Majesty to administer the government of New\r\nBrunswick during the temporary absence of Sir Howard Douglas, a copy of\r\nit has been transmitted to the undersigned, and he begs leave to submit\r\nit[15] to the consideration of the Secretary of State of the United\r\nStates, together with an extract[15] of the letter of Mr. Black which\r\naccompanied it. As it appears by the report of Mr. Maclauchlan, the\r\nmagistrate, that some American citizens settled in the disputed\r\nterritory are implicated in the trespasses which have been committed,\r\nMr. Black, the president and commissioner in chief of the government of\r\nNew Brunswick, suggests the propriety of an officer being appointed by\r\nthe Government of the United States to act in concert with the British\r\nmagistrate in preventing further depredations.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned has received from Mr. Black the most satisfactory\r\nassurances that it will be his earnest study to adhere scrupulously to\r\nthe good feeling and conciliatory conduct toward the United States which\r\nhas been observed by Sir Howard Douglas.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned seizes this opportunity to renew to Mr. Van Buren the\r\nassurances of his distinguished consideration.\r\n\r\nCHAS.

EDWARD LIVINGSTON, etc.:\r\n\r\nThe undersigned, His Britannic Majesty's chargé d'affaires, has the\r\nhonor to acquaint Mr. Livingston, Secretary of State of the United\r\nStates, that he has received a communication from His Majesty's\r\nlieutenant-governor of New Brunswick, stating that the authorities\r\nof Maine have endeavored to exercise a jurisdiction over part of the\r\nterritory at present in dispute between His Majesty and the United\r\nStates, and, further, that an order has been issued by a justice of the\r\npeace for the county of Penobscot to the inhabitants of the town of\r\nMadawaska to assemble for the purpose of choosing municipal officers.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned regrets sincerely that these irregular proceedings\r\nshould have been had recourse to during a period when the question of\r\nboundary is in a course of settlement, and in opposition to the desire\r\nexpressed by the President that pending the discussion of that question\r\nthe State of Maine should refrain from committing any act which could\r\nbe construed into a violation of the neighboring territory.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned begs leave to submit to the Secretary of State several\r\ndocuments[15] which he has received from Sir Archibald Campbell in\r\nsupport of his complaint of a violation of territory; and the\r\nundersigned entertains a confident hope that such measures will be\r\nadopted as shall prevent a recurrence of acts on the part of the\r\nauthorities of the State of Maine which are productive of so much\r\ninconvenience and which tend to disturb that harmony and good will\r\nso necessary to be preserved between the two countries.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned has the honor to renew to Mr. Livingston the assurances\r\nof his distinguished consideration.\r\n\r\nCHARLES BANKHEAD.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: Omitted.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Livingston to Mr. Bankhead_.\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE,\r\n\r\n_Washington, October 17, 1831_.\r\n\r\nCHARLES BANKHEAD, Esq., etc.\r\n\r\nSIR: Immediately after receiving your note of the 1st instant I wrote to\r\nthe governor of the State of Maine for information on the subject of it.\r\nI have just received his answer, of which I have the honor to inclose\r\ntwo extracts.[16] By the first you will perceive that the election of\r\ntown officers in the settlement of Madawaska, of which complaint was\r\nmade in the papers inclosed in your letter, was made under color of\r\na general law, which was not intended by either the executive or\r\nlegislative authority of that State to be executed in that settlement,\r\nand that the whole was the work of inconsiderate individuals.\r\n\r\nBy the second extract it will appear that the individuals said to have\r\nbeen most prominent in setting up the authority of the State have been\r\narrested by order of the lieutenant-governor of the Province of New\r\nBrunswick, and were on their way to be imprisoned at Frederickton.\r\n\r\nThe innovation on the existing state of things in the disputed\r\nterritory being distinctly disavowed by the executive authority of the\r\nState, no act of authority or exercise of jurisdiction having followed\r\nthe election, I would respectfully suggest the propriety of your\r\nrecommending to the lieutenant-governor of New Brunswick the release of\r\nthe prisoners who were arrested for exercising this act of authority\r\nin the territory mutually claimed by the two nations, contrary to the\r\nunderstanding between their Governments. It is their avowed object to\r\navoid any collision until the intention of both parties in relation\r\nto the award shall be fully known. All subjects calculated to produce\r\nirritation, therefore, ought evidently to be avoided. The arrest of the\r\npersons concerned in the election must produce that feeling in a high\r\ndegree. A conviction can not take place without eliciting a decision\r\nfrom the bench declaratory of and enforcing the jurisdiction over the\r\nterritory in dispute, which it is the present policy of both powers to\r\navoid, at least for the short time that must elapse before the question\r\ncan be finally settled. If punishment should follow conviction, the\r\npassions that would be excited must inevitably be hostile to that spirit\r\nof conciliation so necessary where sacrifices of national feeling and\r\nindividual interest are required for the common good. It would be absurd\r\nhere to enter into the question of title. Both parties claim it. No act\r\nthat either can do is necessary to assist its right while there is hope\r\nof an amicable arrangement; and it was with this view of the subject\r\nthat a mutual understanding has been had to leave things in the state\r\nin which they are until the question of the award is settled.\r\n\r\nOn the part of the Americans some individuals, in contravention of this\r\nunderstanding, have proceeded to do acts which if followed out would\r\nchange the political state of part of the disputed land. But it has\r\nnot been so followed out; it is disavowed by the power whose assent\r\nis necessary to carry it into execution. It is therefore of no avail,\r\nand can have no more effect than if the same number of men had met at\r\nMadawaska and declared themselves duly elected members of the British\r\nParliament. The act interferes with no right; it comes in actual\r\ncollision with no established power. Not so the punishment of the\r\nindividuals concerned. This is at once a practical decision of the\r\nquestion, and may lead to retaliating legal measures; for if the\r\nlieutenant-governor of New Brunswick feels himself obliged, as he says\r\nhe does, to impose the authority of the law within which he thinks\r\nthe boundaries of his Province, will not the same feeling incite the\r\ngovernor of Maine, under the same sense of duty, to pursue the like\r\nmeasures? And thus the fruits of moderation and mutual forbearance\r\nduring so long a period will be lost for the want of perseverance in\r\nthem for the short time that is now wanting to bring the controversy\r\nto an amicable close. It is therefore, sir, that I invite your\r\ninterposition with his excellency the lieutenant-governor of New\r\nBrunswick to induce him to set at liberty the persons arrested, on their\r\nengagement to make no change in the state of things until the business\r\nshall be finally decided between the two Governments.\r\n\r\nOn our part, the desire of the General Government to avoid any measures\r\ntending to a change in the existing state of things on our northeast\r\nboundary has been fully and, it is believed, efficaciously expressed to\r\nthe executive of the State of Maine, so that the actual relation of the\r\nState with the neighboring Province will not in future suffer any\r\nchange.\r\n\r\nI have great pleasure, sir, in renewing on this occasion the assurance\r\nof my high consideration.\r\n\r\nEDWD.

Vaughan, His Britannic Majesty's envoy extraordinary and minister\r\nplenipotentiary, requesting the intervention of the Government of the\r\nUnited States to put a stop to certain proceedings of the State of Maine\r\nin the territory still in dispute between Great Britain and the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings referred to appear, by the letter of the\r\nlieutenant-governor of New Brunswick and the report of the officer\r\nacting on the part of Great Britain as warden of the disputed territory\r\n(copies of which accompanied Sir Charles R. Vaughan's note), to be the\r\nconstruction of a road to the Restook River, passing, as is alleged,\r\nthrough 15 miles of the disputed territory, and supposed by the warden\r\nto be intended to intersect the St. John River in the Madawaska\r\nsettlement.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned is happy to have it in his power to afford at once\r\nsuch explanations upon this subject as he trusts may be satisfactory.\r\nBy a communication received from the governor of Maine, in answer to a\r\nrepresentation recently made by Sir Charles R. Vaughan concerning other\r\nalleged encroachments on the disputed territory, it will be seen that\r\nno part of the road now constructing by that State is believed to be\r\nwithin the territory of which the British Government has ever been in the\r\nactual possession since the treaty of 1783, and that it is not designed\r\nto extend the road beyond the Aroostook. The apprehensions entertained\r\nof its being extended to the St. John River in the Madawaska settlement\r\nappear, therefore, to be groundless, and, if the views of the governor\r\nof Maine as to the locality of the road be correct, it would seem that\r\nits construction can afford no just cause of complaint, as it is not\r\nsupposed that such improvements made by either party within that part\r\nof the territory which has been in its possession, or so considered,\r\nsince the treaty of 1783 are contrary to the spirit of the existing\r\nunderstanding between the two Governments. It will be seen, moreover,\r\nas well by the communication from the governor of Maine as by one\r\nreceived from the governor of Massachusetts on the same occasion, that\r\na conciliatory and forbearing disposition prevails on their part, and\r\nthat no measures will be taken or any acts authorized by them which may\r\njustly be considered as a violation of the understanding in regard to\r\nthe disputed territory.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned has nevertheless been directed by the President to\r\ntransmit copies of Sir Charles R. Vaughan's note and its inclosures\r\nto the governors of Maine and Massachusetts, and to repeat to their\r\nexcellencies his earnest desire that as far as depends on them no\r\ndeparture from the understanding between the two Governments may be\r\npermitted.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the complaint heretofore made by Sir Charles R. Vaughan,\r\nupon the representations of the lieutenant-governor of New Brunswick\r\nand the warden of the disputed territory, as to the cutting and sale\r\nof timber under the authority of the land agents of Maine and\r\nMassachusetts, the undersigned begs leave to refer to the communications\r\nfrom the governors of those States already mentioned, copies of which\r\nare now transmitted, by which it appears that the conduct of those\r\nagents has furnished no just cause of dissatisfaction, but that, on the\r\ncontrary, it is alleged that His Britannic Majesty's officers of the\r\nProvince of New Brunswick, by the seizure and sale of timber cut by\r\ntrespassers on the Aroostook, and afterwards in the rightful custody of\r\nthe agent of the State of Massachusetts, have been the first to violate\r\nthe existing understanding upon this subject.\r\n\r\nThese complaints on both sides, arising, as the undersigned believes,\r\nfrom acts which do not on either side indicate an intention to disregard\r\nthe existing understanding, but are attributable to the unsettled state\r\nof the boundary question, and which should therefore be viewed with\r\nmutual forbearance, furnish increased reason for a speedy adjustment of\r\nthat interesting matter; and the President looks with great solicitude\r\nfor the answer, which is daily expected, from the British Government to\r\nthe proposition submitted on the part of the United States, in the hope\r\nthat it may soon set all those difficulties at rest.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned has the honor to renew to Sir Charles R. Vaughan the\r\nassurance of his distinguished consideration.\r\n\r\nLOUIS McLANE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT OF MASSACHUSETTS,\r\n\r\n_November 1, 1833_.\r\n\r\nHon. LOUIS McLANE,\r\n\r\n_Secretary of State of the United States_.\r\n\r\nSIR: I have to acknowledge the honor of the receipt of your letter of\r\nthe 23d of October, covering a copy of a note addressed to you by Sir\r\nCharles R. Vaughan, envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of\r\nHis Britannic Majesty, accompanied also by copies of certain documents\r\nconveying complaints on the part of the authorities of His Majesty's\r\nProvince of New Brunswick \"of the conduct of certain land agents of the\r\nStates of Maine and Massachusetts on the territory in dispute between\r\nthe United States and Great Britain.\"\r\n\r\nPermit me to assure you that I shall lose no time in making inquiry of\r\nthe land agent of this Commonwealth into the supposed occasion of the\r\ncomplaints of His Majesty's provincial officers, and in transmitting to\r\nthe Department of State such information as I may receive in reply.\r\n\r\nPrejudicial as the delay in the settlement of this long-vexed subject\r\nof boundary is to the rights of property which Massachusetts claims\r\nin the disputed territory, and impatient as both the government and\r\nthe people have become at the unreasonableness and pertinacity of the\r\nadversary pretensions and with the present state of the question, yet\r\nthe executive of this Commonwealth will not cease to respect the\r\nunderstanding which has been had between the Governments of the two\r\ncountries, _that no act of wrong to the property of either_ shall be\r\ncommitted during the pending of measures to produce an amicable\r\nadjustment of the controversy.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, I can not but earnestly protest against the authority\r\nof any appointment on the behalf of His Majesty's Government which may\r\nbe regarded as a claim to the executive protection of this property\r\nor be deemed an acquiescence on the part of the United States in an\r\ninterference, _under color_ of a \"wardenship of the disputed territory,\"\r\nwith the direction to its improvement which the governments of\r\nMassachusetts and Maine, respectively, may see fit to give to their\r\nagents. The rights of soil and jurisdiction over it are in the States,\r\nand forbearance to the exercise of these rights for a season, from mere\r\nprudential considerations, a respectful regard to the wishes of the\r\nGeneral Government, or amity toward a foreign nation is not to be\r\nconstrued into a readiness to surrender them upon the issue of any\r\nproposed negotiation.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, sir, with sentiments of the highest respect,\r\nyour obedient servant,\r\n\r\nLEVI LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT OF MAINE,\r\n\r\n_Augusta, November 23, 1833_.\r\n\r\nHon. LOUIS McLANE,\r\n\r\n_Secretary of State of the United States, Washington_.\r\n\r\nSIR: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the\r\n23d of October last, communicating a copy of a note from Sir Charles\r\nR. Vaughan, accompanied with a copy of a letter from Sir Archibald\r\nCampbell, lieutenant-governor of New Brunswick, to Sir Charles R.\r\nVaughan, and also of a letter from Lieutenant J.A. Maclauchlan to Sir\r\nArchibald Campbell, complaining of the conduct of the land agents of the\r\nStates of Maine and Massachusetts in the territory in dispute between\r\nthe United States and Great Britain.\r\n\r\nIn compliance with your request to be furnished with information in\r\nrelation to this subject, I reply that by a resolve of the legislature\r\nof this State passed March 30, 1831, \"the land agent of this State, in\r\nconjunction with the land agent of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, is\r\nauthorized and empowered to survey, lay out, and make a suitable winter\r\nroad, or cause the same to be done, from the mouth of the Matawamkeag, a\r\nbranch of the Penobscot River, in a northerly direction, so as to strike\r\nthe Aroostook River on or near the line dividing the sixth and seventh\r\nranges of townships.\" The same resolve authorizes the land agents to lay\r\nout and make, or cause to be made, a winter road from the village of\r\nHoulton, in a westerly direction, to intersect the road to the Aroostook\r\nRiver at some point most convenient for traveling and most for the\r\ninterest of the State. By a subsequent resolve, passed March 8, 1832,\r\nthe authority given to the land agents was enlarged so as to authorize\r\nthem \"to locate and survey the Aroostook road so that it may strike the\r\nAroostook River at any place between the west line of the third range\r\nand the east line of the sixth range of townships west of the east line\r\nof the State.\" The first of these roads has been surveyed and located,\r\nand much the greater part of it lies within the undisputed limits of\r\nthis State south of the sources of the Penobscot River, and it is\r\nbelieved that no part of it lies within territory of which the British\r\nGovernment has ever been in the actual possession since the treaty of\r\n1783. A portion of this road only has yet been opened, and I have no\r\ninformation that any part of it has been opened over territory _claimed_\r\nby the British, although it is contemplated to extend it to the\r\nAroostook when it can be done consistently with the public interest. The\r\nsecond road described in the resolve of March 30, 1831, is wholly within\r\nthe undisputed limits of this State.\r\n\r\nA report of the recent proceedings of the land agent in making these\r\nroads and disposing of the timber on the lands of the State has not been\r\nreceived, and his late sickness and death have rendered it impossible at\r\nthis time to obtain a detailed statement of all that has been done in\r\nhis official capacity. But it can not be presumed that he has in any\r\nparticular exceeded his instructions (copies of which are herewith\r\ntransmitted[20]), or, in the discharge of his official duties, taken\r\nany measures or authorized any acts to be done which could justly be\r\nconsidered as a violation of any known provision of the existing\r\narrangement between the Governments of the United States and Great\r\nBritain in regard to the disputed territory.\r\n\r\nWith high consideration, I have the honor to be, sir, your obedient\r\nservant,\r\n\r\nSAML. E. SMITH.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: Omitted.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sir Charles R. Vaughan to Mr. McLane_.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 23, 1833_.\r\n\r\nHon. LOUIS McLANE, etc.:\r\n\r\nThe undersigned, His Britannic Majesty's envoy extraordinary and\r\nminister plenipotentiary, has the honor to acknowledge the receipt of\r\nthe note of the Secretary of State of the United States, in answer\r\nto the representation which he was called upon to make respecting\r\nproceedings of the States of Massachusetts and Maine in the disputed\r\nterritory.\r\n\r\nTo understand correctly the bearings of the roads which those States\r\nhave resolved to construct requires a more accurate knowledge of the\r\ntopography of the country through which they are to pass than the\r\nundersigned possesses, but he will not fail to transmit a copy of\r\nMr. McLane's note, together with its inclosures, to His Majesty's\r\nlieutenant-governor of New Brunswick. In the meantime the undersigned\r\nbegs leave to observe that the letter from the executive of Maine states\r\nthat one of the roads surveyed and located lies, for the greater part\r\nof it, within the undisputed limits of that State, although it is\r\ncontemplated to extend it to the Aroostook River. The land agent of\r\nMassachusetts is aware that the road from the river Matawamkeag to the\r\nAroostook is the one that has given rise to complaint, and which, he\r\nobserves, \"is now nearly completed.\" As the Aroostook River, from its\r\nsource till it falls into the St. John, flows exclusively through the\r\ndisputed territory, to reach it by a road from the State of Maine must\r\ncause an encroachment and be considered an attempt to assume a right\r\nof possession in territory which has never yet been set apart from the\r\noriginal possession of Great Britain, on account of the difficulties\r\nof ascertaining the boundary according to the treaty of 1783.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the cutting down and sale of timber, the justification of\r\nthe land agent at Boston will be submitted to Sir Archibald Campbell,\r\nand the undersigned is sure that the grievance complained of (taking\r\naway timber which had been seized by the agent from Massachusetts) will\r\nbe attended to.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned receives with great satisfaction the assurances of Mr.\r\nMcLane that \"a conciliatory and forbearing disposition prevails on the\r\npart of Massachusetts and Maine, and that no measure will be taken\r\nor any acts authorized by them which may justly be considered as a\r\nviolation of the understanding in regard to the disputed territory;\" and\r\nhe can not conclude without begging leave to acknowledge the readiness\r\nwith which the President directed inquiries to be made and the desire\r\nwhich he has shewn on this and every similar occasion to prevent any\r\nencroachment on the disputed territory pending the settlement of the\r\nboundary now in progress between the two Governments.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned has the honor to assure Mr. McLane of his most\r\ndistinguished consideration.\r\n\r\nCHAS.

LOUIS McLANE, etc.:\r\n\r\nThe undersigned, His Britannic Majesty's envoy extraordinary and\r\nminister plenipotentiary, has the honor to communicate to the Secretary\r\nof State of the United States the explanation which he has received from\r\nthe lieutenant-governor of New Brunswick of a transaction complained of\r\nby the land agent of Massachusetts in a report communicated to the\r\nundersigned in a note from Mr. McLane dated 21st December last.\r\n\r\nThe complaint arose out of the seizure of timber cut down without\r\nauthority upon the disputed territory, and which, after having been\r\nseized in the first instance by the land agent of Massachusetts, was\r\ntaken possession of and sold by the British agent intrusted with the\r\npreservation of the disputed territory on the northeastern frontier of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nThe explanation of this transaction is contained in an extract of a\r\nletter to the undersigned from the lieutenant-governor of New Brunswick\r\nand the report of Mr. Beckwith, the surveyor-general of that Province,\r\nwhich the undersigned has the honor to inclose in this note.[21]\r\n\r\nThe seizure of the timber in the first instance by Mr. Coffin, the land\r\nagent of Maine [Massachusetts], was the exercise of authority within the\r\nconventional frontier of the Province of New Brunswick, which could not\r\nbe admitted so long as the northeastern boundary of the United States\r\nremains a subject of negotiation; and it appears that the proceeds of\r\nthe sale of timber unlawfully cut down are carried to account, and\r\nthe possession of them will be appropriated to the party to which the\r\nterritory may be adjudged by the settlement of the boundary question.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned trusts that the explanation which he is now able to give\r\nof this transaction will prove satisfactory to the Government of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned has the honor to renew to Mr. McLane the assurance of\r\nhis most distinguished consideration.\r\n\r\nCHAS.

JOHN FORSYTH, etc.:\r\n\r\nThe undersigned, Her Britannic Majesty's envoy extraordinary and\r\nminister plenipotentiary, is directed by his Government to make the\r\nfollowing observations to Mr. Forsyth, Secretary of State of the United\r\nStates, with reference to certain points connected with the question of\r\nthe northeastern boundary, which question forms the subject of the\r\naccompanying note, which the undersigned has the honor this day to\r\naddress to Mr. Forsyth:\r\n\r\nThe British Government, with a view to prevail upon that of the United\r\nStates to come to an understanding with Great Britain upon the river\r\nquestion, had stated that the King of the Netherlands in his award had\r\ndecided that question according to the British interpretation of it and\r\nhad expressed his opinion that the rivers which fall into the Bay of\r\nFundy are not to be considered as Atlantic rivers for the purposes of\r\nthe treaty.\r\n\r\nMr. Forsyth, however, in his note to Sir Charles Vaughan of the 28th of\r\nApril, 1835, controverts this assertion and maintains that the King of\r\nthe Netherlands did not in his award express such an opinion, and Mr.\r\nForsyth quotes a passage from the award in support of this proposition.\r\n\r\nBut it appears to Her Majesty's Government that Mr. Forsyth has not\r\ncorrectly perceived the meaning of the passage which he quotes, for in\r\nthe passage in question Mr. Forsyth apprehends that the word \"_alone_\"\r\nis governed by the verb \"_include_\" whereas an attentive examination of\r\nthe context will show that the word \"_alone_\" is governed by the verb\r\n\"_divide\"_ and that the real meaning of the passage is this: That the\r\nrivers flowing north and south from the highlands claimed by the United\r\nStates may be arranged in two genera, the first genus comprehending the\r\nrivers which fall into the St. Lawrence, the second genus comprehending\r\nthose whose waters in some manner or other find their way into the\r\nAtlantic; but that even if, according to this general classification\r\nand in contradistinction from rivers flowing into the St. Lawrence, the\r\nrivers which fall into the bays of Chaleurs and Fundy might be comprised\r\nin the same genus with the rivers which fall directly into the Atlantic,\r\nstill the St. John and the Restigouche form a distinct species by\r\nthemselves and do not belong to the species of rivers which fall\r\n_directly_ into the Atlantic, for the St. John and Restigouche are not\r\ndivided in company with any such last-mentioned rivers. And the award\r\ngoes on to say that, moreover, if this distinction between the two\r\nspecies were confounded an erroneous interpretation would be applied\r\nto a treaty in which every separate word must be supposed to have a\r\nmeaning, and a generic distinction would be given to cases which are\r\npurely specific.\r\n\r\nThe above appears to be the true meaning of the passage quoted by\r\nMr. Forsyth; but if that passage had not been in itself sufficiently\r\nexplicit, which Her Majesty's Government think it is, the passage which\r\nimmediately follows it would remove all doubt as to what the opinion\r\nof the King of the Netherlands was upon the river question, for that\r\npassage, setting forth reasons against the line of boundary claimed by\r\nthe United States, goes on to say that such line would not even separate\r\nthe St. Lawrence rivers immediately from the St. John and Restigouche,\r\nand that thus the rivers which this line would separate from the St.\r\nLawrence rivers would need, _in order to reach the Atlantic_, the aid\r\nof _two intermediaries_--first, the rivers St. John and Restigouche,\r\nand, _secondly, the bays of Chaleurs and Fundy_.\r\n\r\nNow it is evident from this passage that the King of the Netherlands\r\ndeemed the bays of Fundy and Chaleurs to be, for the purposes of the\r\ntreaty, as distinct and separate from the Atlantic Ocean as are the\r\nrivers St. John and Restigouche, for he specifically mentions those\r\nrivers and those bays as the channels through which certain rivers would\r\nhave to pass in their way from the northern range of dividing highlands\r\ndown to the Atlantic Ocean; and it is clear that he considers that the\r\nwaters of those highland rivers would not reach the Atlantic Ocean\r\nuntil after they had traveled through the whole extent either of the\r\nRestigouche and the Bay of Chaleurs or of the St. John and the Bay of\r\nFundy, as the case might be; and for this reason, among others, the King\r\nof the Netherlands declared it to be his opinion that the line north of\r\nthe St. John claimed by the United States is not the line intended by\r\nthe treaty.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned avails himself of this occasion to renew to Mr. Forsyth\r\nthe assurances of his high respect and consideration.\r\n\r\nH.S. FOX.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Fox to Mr. Forsyth_.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 19, 1838_.\r\n\r\nHon. JOHN FORSYTH, etc.:\r\n\r\nThe undersigned, Her Britannic Majesty's envoy extraordinary and\r\nminister plenipotentiary, has received the orders of his Government\r\nto make the following communication to the Secretary of State of the\r\nUnited States with reference to the question pending between the two\r\nGovernments upon the subject of the northeastern boundary:\r\n\r\nThe undersigned is, in the first instance, directed to express to\r\nMr. Forsyth the sincere regret of Her Majesty's Government that the\r\nlong-continued endeavors of both parties to come to a settlement of this\r\nimportant matter have hitherto been unavailing. Her Majesty's Government\r\nfeel an undiminished desire to cooperate with the Cabinet of Washington\r\nfor the attainment of an object of so much mutual interest, and they\r\nlearn with satisfaction that their sentiments upon this point are fully\r\nshared by the actual President of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe communications which during the last few years have taken place\r\nbetween the two Governments with reference to the present subject, if\r\nthey have not led to the solution of the questions at issue, have at\r\nleast narrowed the field of future discussion.\r\n\r\nBoth Governments have agreed to consider the award of the King of the\r\nNetherlands as binding upon neither party, and the two Governments,\r\ntherefore, are as free in this respect as they were before the reference\r\nto that Sovereign was made. The British Government, despairing of the\r\npossibility of drawing a line that shall be in literal conformity with\r\nthe words of the treaty of 1783, has suggested that a conventional\r\nboundary should be substituted for the line described by the treaty, and\r\nhas proposed that in accordance with the principles of equity and in\r\npursuance of the general practice of mankind in similar cases the object\r\nof difference should be equally divided between the two differing\r\nparties, each of whom is alike convinced of the justice of its own\r\nclaim.\r\n\r\nThe United States Government has replied that to such an arrangement it\r\nhas no power to agree; that until the line of the treaty shall have been\r\notherwise determined the State of Maine will continue to assume that the\r\nline which it claims is the true line of 1783, and will assert that all\r\nthe land up to that line is territory of Maine; that consequently such a\r\ndivision of the disputed territory as is proposed by Great Britain would\r\nbe considered by Maine as tantamount to a cession of what that State\r\nregards as a part of its own territory, and that the Federal Government\r\nhas no power to agree to such an arrangement without the consent of the\r\nState concerned.\r\n\r\nHer Majesty's Government exceedingly regrets that such an obstacle\r\nshould exist to prevent that settlement which under all the\r\ncircumstances of the case appears to be the simplest, the readiest,\r\nthe most satisfactory, and the most just. Nor can Her Majesty's\r\nGovernment admit that the objection of the State of Maine is well\r\nfounded, for the principle on which that objection rests is as good\r\nfor Great Britain as it is for Maine. If Maine thinks itself entitled to\r\ncontend that until the true line described in the treaty is determined\r\nthe boundary claimed by Maine must be regarded as the right one,\r\nGreat Britain is surely still more entitled to insist upon a similar\r\npretension, and to assert that until the line of the treaty shall be\r\nestablished to the satisfaction of both parties the whole of the\r\ndisputed territory ought to be considered as belonging to the British\r\nCrown, because Great Britain is the original possessor, and all the\r\nterritory which has not been proved to have been by treaty ceded by her\r\nmust be looked upon as belonging to her still. But the very existence\r\nof such conflicting pretensions seems to point out the expediency of a\r\ncompromise, and what compromise can be more fair than that which would\r\ngive to each party one-half of the subject-matter of dispute?\r\n\r\nA conventional line different from that described in the treaty was\r\nagreed to, as stated by Mr. Forsyth in his note of the 28th of April,\r\n1835, with respect to the boundary westward from the Lake of the Woods.\r\nWhy should such a line not be agreed to likewise for the boundary\r\neastward from the river Connecticut?\r\n\r\nHer Majesty's Government can not refrain from again pressing this\r\nproposition upon the serious consideration of the Government of the\r\nUnited States as the arrangement which would be best calculated to\r\neffect a prompt and satisfactory settlement between the two powers.\r\n\r\nThe Government of the United States, indeed, while it expressed a doubt\r\nof its being able to obtain the assent of Maine to the above-mentioned\r\nproposal, did, nevertheless, express its readiness to apply to the State\r\nof Maine for the assent of that State to the adoption of another\r\nconventional line, which should make the river St. John from its source\r\nto its mouth the boundary between the two countries. But it is difficult\r\nto understand upon what grounds any expectation could have been formed\r\nthat such a proposal could be entertained by the British Government,\r\nfor such an arrangement would give to the United States even greater\r\nadvantages than they would obtain by an unconditional acquiescence in\r\ntheir claim to the whole of the disputed territory, because such an\r\narrangement would, in the first place, give to Maine all that part of\r\nthe disputed territory which lies to the south of the St. John, and\r\nwould, in the next place, in exchange for the remaining part of the\r\ndisputed territory which lies to the north of the St. John, add to\r\nthe State of Maine a large district of New Brunswick lying between\r\nthe United States boundary and the southern part of the course of\r\nthe St. John--a district smaller, indeed, in extent, but much more\r\nconsiderable in value, than the portion of the disputed territory which\r\nlies to the north of the St. John.\r\n\r\nBut with respect to a conventional line generally, the Government\r\nof Washington has stated that it has not at present the powers\r\nconstitutionally requisite for treating for such a line and has no hopes\r\nof obtaining such powers until the impossibility of establishing the\r\nline described by the treaty shall have been completely demonstrated by\r\nthe failure of another attempt to trace that line by a local survey.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances it appears that a conventional line can not\r\nat present be agreed upon, and that such a mode of settlement is in the\r\nexisting state of the negotiation impossible.\r\n\r\nThus, then, the award of the King of the Netherlands has been abandoned\r\nby both parties in consequence of its rejection by the American Senate,\r\nand a negotiation between the two Governments for a conventional line\r\nsuited to the interests and convenience of the two parties has for the\r\npresent been rendered impossible by difficulties arising on the part\r\nof the United States; and both Governments are alike averse to a new\r\narbitration. In this state of things the Government of the United States\r\nhas proposed to the British cabinet that another attempt should be made\r\nto trace out a boundary according to the letter of the treaty, and that\r\na commission of exploration and survey should be appointed for that\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nHer Majesty's Government have little expectation that such a commission\r\ncould lead to any useful result, and on that account would be disposed\r\nto object to the measure; but at the same time they are so unwilling to\r\nreject the only plan now left which seems to afford a chance of making\r\nany further advance in this long-pending matter that they will not\r\nwithhold their consent to such a commission if the principle upon which\r\nit is to be formed and the manner in which it is to proceed can be\r\nsatisfactorily settled.\r\n\r\nThe United States Government have proposed two modes in which such\r\na commission might be constituted: First, that it might consist of\r\ncommissioners named in equal numbers by each of the two Governments,\r\nwith an umpire to be selected by some friendly European power; secondly,\r\nthat it might be entirely composed of scientific Europeans, to be\r\nselected by a friendly sovereign, and might be accompanied in its\r\noperations by agents of the two different parties, in order that such\r\nagents might give to the commissioners assistance and information.\r\n\r\nIf such a commission were to be appointed, Her Majesty's Government\r\nthink that the first of these two modes of constructing it would be\r\nthe best, and that it should consist of members chosen in equal numbers\r\nby each of the two Governments. It might, however, be better that the\r\numpire should be selected by the members of the commission themselves\r\nrather than that the two Governments should apply to a third power to\r\nmake such a choice.\r\n\r\nThe object of this commission, as understood by Her Majesty's\r\nGovernment, would be to explore the disputed territory in order to find\r\nwithin its limits dividing highlands which may answer the description\r\nof the treaty, the search being first to be made in the due north line\r\nfrom the monument at the head of the St. Croix, and if no such highlands\r\nshould be found in that meridian the search to be then continued to the\r\nwestward thereof; and Her Majesty's Government have stated their opinion\r\nthat in order to avoid all fruitless disputes as to the character of\r\nsuch highlands the commissioners should be instructed to look for\r\nhighlands which both parties might acknowledge as fulfilling the\r\nconditions of the treaty.\r\n\r\nThe United States Secretary of State, in his note of the 5th of March,\r\n1836, expresses a wish to know how the report of the commissioners\r\nwould, according to the views of Her Majesty's Government, be likely\r\nwhen rendered to lead to an ultimate settlement of the question of\r\nboundary between the two Governments.\r\n\r\nIn reply to this inquiry Her Majesty's Government would beg to observe\r\nthat the proposal to appoint a commission originated not with them, but\r\nwith the Government of the United States, and that it is therefore\r\nrather for the Government of the United States than for that of Great\r\nBritain to answer this question.\r\n\r\nHer Majesty's Government have themselves already stated that they have\r\nlittle expectation that such a commission could lead to any useful\r\nresult, and that they would on that account be disposed to object to\r\nit; and if Her Majesty's Government were now to agree to appoint such\r\na commission it would be only in compliance with the desire so strongly\r\nexpressed by the Government of the United States, and in spite of doubts\r\n(which Her Majesty's Government still continue to entertain) of the\r\nefficacy of the measure.\r\n\r\nBut with respect to the way in which the report of the commission\r\nmight be likely to lead to an ultimate settlement of the question,\r\nHer Majesty's Government, in the first place, conceive that it was\r\nmeant by the Government of the United States, that if the commission\r\nshould discover highlands answering to the description of the treaty a\r\nconnecting line drawn from these highlands to the head of the St. Croix\r\nshould be deemed to be a portion of the boundary line between the two\r\ncountries. But Her Majesty's Government would further beg to refer the\r\nUnited States Secretary of State to the notes of Mr. McLane of the 5th\r\nof June, 1833, and of the 11th and 28th of March, 1834, on this subject,\r\nin which it will be seen that the Government of the United States\r\nappears to have contemplated as one of the possible results of the\r\nproposed commission of exploration that such additional information\r\nmight possibly be obtained respecting the features of the country in the\r\ndistrict to which the treaty relates as might remove all doubt as to the\r\nimpracticability of laying down a boundary in accordance with the letter\r\nof the treaty.\r\n\r\nAnd if the investigations of the proposed commission should show that\r\nthere is no reasonable prospect of finding a line strictly conformable\r\nwith the description contained in the treaty of 1783, the constitutional\r\ndifficulties which now prevent the United States from agreeing to a\r\nconventional line may possibly be removed, and the way may thus be\r\nprepared for the satisfactory settlement of the difference by an\r\nequitable division of the disputed territory.\r\n\r\nBut if the two Governments should agree to the appointment of such a\r\ncommission it would be necessary that their agreement should be first\r\nrecorded in a convention, and it would obviously be indispensable that\r\nthe State of Maine should be an assenting party to the arrangement.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned, in making the above communication by order of\r\nHer Majesty's Government to the United States Secretary of State,\r\nMr. Forsyth, has the honor to renew to him the assurance of his high\r\nrespect and consideration.\r\n\r\nH.S. FOX.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Forsyth to Mr. Fox_.\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE,\r\n\r\n_Washington, February 6, 1838_.\r\n\r\n\r\nHENRY S. FOX, Esq., etc.:\r\n\r\nThe undersigned, Secretary of State of the United States, has the honor\r\nto acknowledge the receipt of the note of Mr. Fox, envoy extraordinary\r\nand minister plenipotentiary of Her Britannic Majesty, of the 10th\r\nultimo, in which he presents, by direction of his Government, certain\r\nobservations in respect to the construction to be given to that\r\npart of the award of the arbiter on the question of the northeastern\r\nboundary which relates to the character in which the rivers St. John\r\nand Restigouche are to be regarded in reference to that question.\r\nSir Charles Vaughan, in his note to Mr. McLane of February 10, 1834,\r\nalleged that although the arbiter had not decided the first of the three\r\nmain questions proposed to him, yet that he had determined certain\r\nsubordinate points connected with that question upon which the parties\r\nhad entertained different views, and among others that the rivers St.\r\nJohn and Restigouche could not be considered, according to the meaning\r\nof the treaty, as \"rivers flowing into the Atlantic.\" The undersigned,\r\nin his note to Sir Charles R. Vaughan of the 28th of April, 1835,\r\nquestioned the correctness of the interpretation which had been given by\r\nSir Charles to the award of the arbiter in this particular, and after\r\nquoting that part of the award to which Sir Charles was supposed to\r\nrefer as containing the determination by the arbiter of the point just\r\nmentioned observed that it could not but appear from further reflection\r\nto Sir Charles that the declaration that the rivers St. John and\r\nRestigouche could not be _alone_ taken into view without hazard in\r\ndetermining the disputed boundary was not the expression of an opinion\r\nthat they should be altogether excluded in determining that question;\r\nor, in other words, that they could not be looked upon as rivers\r\nemptying into the Atlantic. The remarks presented by Mr. Fox in the note\r\nto which this is a reply are designed to shew a misconception on the\r\npart of the undersigned of the true meaning of the passage cited by him\r\nfrom the award and to support the construction which was given to it by\r\nSir Charles Vaughan. Whether the apprehension entertained by the one\r\nparty or the other of the opinion of the arbiter upon this minor point\r\nbe correct is regarded by the undersigned as a matter of no consequence\r\nin the settlement of the main question. The Government of the United\r\nStates, never having acquiesced in the decision of the arbiter that \"the\r\nnature of the difference and the vague and not sufficiently determinate\r\nstipulations of the treaty of 1783 do not permit the adjudication of\r\neither of the two lines respectively claimed by the interested parties\r\nto one of the said parties without wounding the principles of law and\r\nequity with regard to the other,\" can not consent to be governed in the\r\nprosecution of the existing negotiation by the opinion of the arbiter\r\nupon any of the preliminary points about which there was a previous\r\ndifference between the parties, and the adverse decision of which\r\nhas led to so unsatisfactory and, in the view of this Government, so\r\nerroneous a conclusion. This determination on the part of the United\r\nStates not to adopt the premises of the arbiter while rejecting his\r\nconclusion has been heretofore made known to Her Majesty's Government,\r\nand while it remains must necessarily render the discussion of the\r\nquestion what those premises were unavailing, if not irrelevant. The few\r\nobservations which the undersigned was led to make in the course of his\r\nnote to Sir Charles Vaughan upon one of the points alleged to have been\r\nthus determined were prompted only by a respect for the arbiter and a\r\nconsequent anxiety to remove a misinterpretation of his meaning, which\r\nalone, it was believed, could induce the supposition that the arbiter,\r\nin searching for the rivers referred to in the treaty as designating the\r\nboundary, could have come to the opinion that the two great rivers whose\r\nwaters pervaded the whole district in which the search was made and\r\nconstituted the most striking objects of the country had been entirely\r\nunnoticed by the negotiators of the treaty and were to be passed over\r\nunheeded in determining the line, while others were to be sought for\r\nwhich he himself asserts could not be found. That the imputation of\r\nsuch an opinion to the respected arbiter could only be the result\r\nof misinterpretation seemed the more evident, as he had himself\r\ndeclared that \"it could not be sufficiently explained how, if the\r\nhigh contracting parties intended in 1783 to establish the boundary\r\nat the south of the river St. John, that river, to which the territory\r\nin dispute was in a great measure indebted for its distinctive\r\ncharacter, had been neutralized and set aside.\" It is under the\r\ninfluence of the same motives that the undersigned now proceeds to\r\nmake a brief comment upon the observations contained in Mr. Fox's note\r\nof the 10th ultimo, and thus to close a discussion which it can answer\r\nno purpose to prolong.\r\n\r\nThe passage from the award of the arbiter quoted by the undersigned\r\nin his note of the 28th April, 1835, to Sir Charles Vaughan, and the\r\ntrue meaning of which Mr. Fox supposes to have been misconceived, is\r\nthe following: \"If in contradistinction to the rivers that empty\r\nthemselves into the river St. Lawrence it had been proper, agreeably\r\nto the language ordinarily used in geography, to comprehend the rivers\r\nfalling into the bays Fundy and Des Chaleurs with those emptying\r\nthemselves directly into the Atlantic Ocean in the generical\r\ndenomination of rivers falling into the Atlantic Ocean it would be\r\nhazardous to include into the species belonging to that class the rivers\r\nSt. John and Restigouche, which the line claimed at the north of the\r\nriver St. John divides _immediately_ from rivers emptying themselves\r\ninto the river St. Lawrence, not with other rivers falling into the\r\nAtlantic Ocean, but _alone_, and thus to apply in interpreting the\r\ndelimitation established by a treaty, where each word must have a\r\nmeaning, to two exclusively special cases, and where no mention is made\r\nof the genus (_genre_), a generical expression which would ascribe to\r\nthem a broader meaning,\" etc.\r\n\r\nIt was observed by the undersigned that this passage did not appear to\r\ncontain an expression of opinion by the arbiter that the rivers St. John\r\nand Restigouche should be altogether excluded in determining the\r\nquestion of disputed boundary, or, in other words, that they could not\r\nbe looked upon as \"rivers emptying into the Atlantic.\" Mr. Fox alleges\r\nthis to be a misconception of the meaning of the arbiter, and supposes\r\nit to have arisen from an erroneous apprehension by the undersigned that\r\nthe word \"_alone_\" is governed by the verb \"_include_,\" whereas he\r\nthinks that an attentive examination of the context will shew that the\r\nword \"_alone_\" is governed by the verb \"_divide,_\" and that the real\r\nmeaning of the passage is this: \"That the rivers flowing north and south\r\nfrom the highlands claimed by the United States may be arranged in two\r\ngenera, the first genus comprehending the rivers which fall into the\r\nSt. Lawrence, the second genus comprehending those whose waters in some\r\nmanner or other find their way into the Atlantic; but that even if,\r\naccording to the general classification and in contradistinction from\r\nrivers flowing into the St. Lawrence, the rivers which fall into the\r\nbays of Chaleurs and Fundy might be comprised in the same genus with the\r\nrivers which fall directly into the Atlantic, still the St. John and the\r\nRestigouche form a distinct species by themselves and do not belong to\r\nthe species of rivers which fall _directly_ into the Atlantic, for the\r\nSt. John and Restigouche are not divided in company with any _such\r\nlast-mentioned rivers_.\" The undersigned considers it unnecessary\r\nto enter into the question whether according to the context the\r\ncircumstance expressed by the adverb \"alone\" has reference to the verb\r\n\"divide\" or to the verb \"include,\" because even allowing it to refer to\r\nthe former it does not appear to the undersigned that his interpretation\r\nof the passage is thereby impaired or that of Mr. Fox sustained. The\r\nundersigned conceives that the arbiter contemplated two different\r\n_species_ of rivers as admissible into _genus_ of those which \"fall into\r\nthe Atlantic,\" to wit, those which fall _directly_ into the Atlantic and\r\nthose which fall into it _indirectly_; that the arbiter was further of\r\nopinion, though at variance with the idea entertained in that respect by\r\nthe United States, that the rivers St. John and Restigouche, emptying\r\ntheir waters into the bays of Fundy and Des Chaleurs, did not belong to\r\nthe species of rivers falling _directly_ into the Atlantic; that if they\r\nwere considered _alone_, therefore, the appellation of \"rivers falling\r\ninto the Atlantic Ocean\" could not be regarded as applicable to them,\r\nbecause, to use the language of the award, it would be \"applying to two\r\nexclusively special cases, where no mention was made of the genus, a\r\ngenerical expression which would ascribe to them a broader meaning;\" but\r\nit is not conceived that the arbiter intended to express an opinion that\r\nthese rivers _might not be included with others_ in forming the _genus_\r\nof rivers described by the treaty as those which \"fall into the\r\nAtlantic,\" and that upon this ground they should be wholly excluded in\r\ndetermining the question of the disputed boundary. While, therefore, the\r\nundersigned agrees with Mr. Fox that the arbiter did not consider these\r\nrivers as falling directly into the Atlantic Ocean, the undersigned can\r\nnot concur in Mr. Fox's construction when he supposes the arbiter to\r\ngive as a reason for this that they are not divided in company with any\r\n_such last-mentioned rivers_--that is, with rivers falling _directly_\r\ninto the Atlantic. Conceding as a point which it is deemed unnecessary\r\nfor the present purpose to discuss that the grammatical construction of\r\nthe sentence contended for by Mr. Fox is the correct one, the arbiter is\r\nunderstood to say only that those rivers are not divided _immediately_\r\nwith others falling into the Atlantic, either directly or indirectly,\r\nbut he does not allege this to be a sufficient reason for excluding them\r\nwhen connected with other rivers divided mediately from those emptying\r\ninto the St. Lawrence from the genus of rivers \"falling into the\r\nAtlantic.\" On the contrary, it is admitted in the award that the\r\nline claimed to the north of the St. John divides the St. John and\r\nRestigouche in company with the Schoodic Lakes, the Penobscot, and the\r\nKennebec, which are stated as emptying themselves _directly_ into the\r\nAtlantic; and it is strongly implied in the language used by the arbiter\r\nthat the first-named rivers might, in his opinion, be classed for the\r\npurposes of the treaty with those last named, though not in the same\r\n_species_, yet in the same _genus_ of \"Atlantic rivers.\"\r\n\r\nThe reason why the St. John and Restigouche were not permitted to\r\ndetermine the question of boundary in favor of the United States is\r\nunderstood to have been, not that they were to be wholly excluded as\r\nrivers not falling into the Atlantic Ocean, as Mr. Fox appears to\r\nsuppose, but because in order to include them in that genus of rivers\r\nthey must be considered in connection with other rivers which were not\r\ndivided _immediately_, like themselves, from the rivers falling into the\r\nSt. Lawrence, but _mediately_ only; which would introduce the principle\r\nthat the treaty of 1783 meant highlands that divide as well mediately as\r\nimmediately the rivers that empty themselves into the river St. Lawrence\r\nfrom those which fall into the Atlantic Ocean--a principle which the\r\narbiter did not reject as unfounded or erroneous, but which, considered\r\nin connection with the other points which he had decided, he regarded as\r\n_equally realized by both lines_, and therefore as constituting an equal\r\nweight in either scale, and consequently affording him no assistance in\r\ndetermining the dispute between the respective parties.\r\n\r\nThe arbiter appears to the undersigned to have viewed the rivers St.\r\nJohn and Restigouche as possessing both a specific and a generic\r\ncharacter; that considered _alone_ they were _specific_', and the\r\ndesignation in the treaty of \"rivers falling into the Atlantic\" was\r\ninapplicable to them; that considered _In connection with other rivers_\r\nthey were _generic_ and were embraced in the terms of the treaty, but\r\nthat as their connection with other rivers would bring them within a\r\nprinciple which, according to the views taken by him of other parts of\r\nthe question, was equally realized by both lines, it would be hazardous\r\nto allow them any weight in deciding the disputed boundary. It has\r\nalways been contended by this Government that the rivers St. John and\r\nRestigouche were to be considered in connection with the Penobscot and\r\nKennebec in determining the highlands called for by the treaty, and the\r\narbiter is not understood to deny to them, when thus connected, the\r\ncharacter of \"rivers falling into the Atlantic Ocean.\"\r\n\r\nThis construction of the arbiter's meaning, derived from the general\r\ntenor of the context, it will be perceived, is not invalidated by the\r\nnext succeeding paragraph cited by Mr. Fox, in which the bays of Fundy\r\nand Des Chaleurs are spoken of as _intermediaries_ whereby the rivers\r\nflowing into the St. John and Restigouche reach the Atlantic Ocean,\r\ninasmuch as such construction admits the opinion of the arbiter to have\r\nbeen that the St. John and Restigouche do not fall _directly_ into the\r\nAtlantic, and that they thus constitute a _species_ by themselves, while\r\nit denies that they are therefore excluded by the arbiter from the genus\r\nof \"4' rivers falling into the Atlantic.\"\r\n\r\nThe undersigned avails himself of this opportunity to renew to Mr. Fox\r\nthe assurance of his distinguished consideration.\r\n\r\nJOHN FORSYTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Forsyth to Mr. Fox_.\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE,\r\n\r\n_Washington, February 7, 1838_.\r\n\r\nHENRY S. FOX, Esq., etc.:\r\n\r\nThe undersigned, Secretary of State of the United States, has the honor\r\nto acknowledge the receipt of the note addressed to him on the 10th\r\nultimo by Mr. Fox, Her Britannic Majesty's envoy extraordinary and\r\nminister plenipotentiary at Washington, with regard to the question\r\npending between the two Governments upon the subject of the northeastern\r\nboundary, and to inform him that his communication has been submitted to\r\nthe President. It has received from him the attentive examination due\r\nto a paper expected to embody the views of Her Britannic Majesty's\r\nGovernment in reference to interests of primary importance to both\r\ncountries. But whilst the President sees with satisfaction the\r\nexpression it contains of a continued desire on the part of Her\r\nMajesty's Government to cooperate with this in its earnest endeavors to\r\narrange the matter of dispute between them, he perceives with feelings\r\nof deep disappointment that the answer now presented to the propositions\r\nmade by this Government with the view of effecting that object, after\r\nhaving been so long delayed, notwithstanding the repeated intimations\r\nthat it was looked for here with much anxiety, is so indefinite in\r\nits terms as to render it impracticable to ascertain without further\r\ndiscussion what are the real wishes and intentions of Her Majesty's\r\nGovernment respecting the proposed appointment of a commission of\r\nexploration and survey to trace out a boundary according to the letter\r\nof the treaty of 1783. The President, however, for the purpose of\r\nplacing in the possession of the State of Maine the views of Her\r\nMajesty's Government as exhibited in Mr. Fox's note, and of ascertaining\r\nthe sense of the State authorities upon the expediency of meeting those\r\nviews so far as they are developed therein, has directed the undersigned\r\nto transmit a copy of it to Governor Kent for their consideration. This\r\nwill be accordingly done without unnecessary delay, and the result when\r\nobtained may form the occasion of a further communication to Her\r\nMajesty's minister.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the undersigned avails himself of the present occasion\r\nto offer a few remarks upon certain parts of Mr. Fox's note of the 10th\r\nultimo. After adverting to the suggestion heretofore made by the British\r\nGovernment that a conventional line equally dividing the territory in\r\ndispute between the two parties should be substituted for the line\r\ndescribed by the treaty, and regretting the constitutional incompetency\r\nof the Federal Government to agree to such an arrangement without the\r\nconsent of the State of Maine, Mr. Fox refers to the conventional line\r\nadopted, although different from that designated by the treaty, with\r\nrespect to the boundary westward from the Lake of the Woods, and asks,\r\n\"Why should such a line not be agreed to likewise for the boundary\r\neastward from the river Connecticut?\" The reply to this question is\r\nobvious. The parallel of latitude adopted on the occasion referred to\r\nas a conventional substitute for the treaty line passed over territory\r\nwithin the exclusive jurisdiction of the General Government without\r\ntrenching upon the rights or claims of any individual member of the\r\nUnion, and the legitimate power of the Government, therefore, to agree\r\nto such line was perfect and unquestioned. Now in consenting to a\r\nconventional line for the boundary eastward from the river Connecticut\r\nthe Government of the United States would transcend its constitutional\r\npowers, since such a measure could only be carried into effect by\r\nviolating the jurisdiction of a sovereign State of the Union and by\r\nassuming to alienate, without the color of rightful authority to do\r\nso, a portion of the territory claimed by the State.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the suggestion made by the undersigned in his note of the\r\n29th of February, 1836, of the readiness of the President to apply to\r\nthe State of Maine for her assent to the adoption of a conventional line\r\nmaking the river St. John, from its source to its mouth, the boundary\r\nbetween the United States and the adjacent British Provinces, Mr. Fox\r\nthinks it difficult to understand upon what grounds an expectation\r\ncould have been formed that such a proposal could be entertained by\r\nthe British Government, since such an arrangement would give to the\r\nUnited States even greater advantages than would be obtained by an\r\nunconditional acquiescence in their claim to the whole territory in\r\ndispute. In making the suggestion referred to, the undersigned expressly\r\nstated to Mr. Bankhead that it was offered, as the proposition on the\r\npart of Great Britain that led to it was supposed to have been, without\r\nregard to the mere question of acres--the extent of territory lost or\r\nacquired by the respective parties. The suggestion was submitted in the\r\nhope that the preponderating importance of terminating at once and\r\nforever this controversy by establishing an unchangeable and definite\r\nand indisputable boundary would be seen and acknowledged by Her\r\nMajesty's Government, and have a correspondent weight in influencing its\r\ndecision. That the advantages of substituting a river for a highland\r\nboundary could not fail to be recognized was apparent from the fact that\r\nMr. Bankhead's note of 28th December, 1835, suggested the river St. John\r\nfrom the point in which it is intersected by a due north line drawn from\r\nthe monument at the head of the St. Croix to the southernmost source of\r\nthat river as a part of the general outline of a conventional boundary.\r\nNo difficulty was anticipated on the part of Her Majesty's Government in\r\nunderstanding the grounds upon which such a proposal was expected to be\r\nentertained by it, since the precedent proposition of Mr. Bankhead, just\r\nadverted to, although professedly based on the principle of an equal\r\ndivision between the parties, could not be justified by it, as it would\r\nhave given nearly two-thirds of the disputed territory to Her Majesty's\r\nGovernment. It was therefore fairly presumed that the river line\r\npresented, in the opinion of Her Majesty's Government, advantages\r\nsufficient to counterbalance any loss of territory by either party that\r\nwould follow its adoption as a boundary. Another recommendation of the\r\nriver line, it was supposed, would be found by Her Majesty's Government\r\nin the fact that whilst by its adoption the right of jurisdiction alone\r\nwould have been yielded to the United States over that portion of New\r\nBrunswick south of the St. John, Great Britain would have acquired the\r\nright of soil as well as of jurisdiction of the whole portion of the\r\ndisputed territory north of the river. It is to be lamented that the\r\nimposing considerations alluded to have failed in their desired\r\neffect--that the hopes of the President in regard to them have not been\r\nrealized, and consequently that Her Britannic Majesty's Government is\r\nnot prepared at present to enter into an arrangement of the existing\r\ndifference between the two nations upon the basis proposed.\r\n\r\nIt would seem to the undersigned, from an expression used in Mr. Fox's\r\nlate communication, that some misapprehension exists on his part either\r\nas to the object of this Government in asking for information relative\r\nto the manner in which the report of a commission of exploration and\r\nsurvey might tend to a practical result in the settlement of the\r\nboundary question or as to the distinctive difference between the\r\nAmerican proposal for the appointment of such a commission and the\r\nsame proposition when modified to meet the wishes of Her Majesty's\r\nGovernment. Of the two modes suggested, by direction of the President,\r\nfor constituting such a commission, the first is that which is regarded\r\nby Her Majesty's Government with most favor, viz, the commissioners to\r\nbe chosen in equal numbers by each of the two parties, with an umpire\r\nselected by some friendly European sovereign to decide on all points on\r\nwhich they might disagree, with instructions to explore the disputed\r\nterritory in order to find within its limits dividing highlands\r\nanswering to the description of the treaty of 1783, in a due north or\r\nnorthwesterly direction from the monument at the head of the St. Croix,\r\nand that a right line drawn between such highlands and said monument\r\nshould form so far as it extends a part of the boundary between the two\r\ncountries, etc. It is now intimated that Her Majesty's Government will\r\nnot withhold its consent to such a commission \"if the principle upon\r\nwhich it is to be formed and the manner in which it is to proceed can be\r\nsatisfactorily settled.\" This condition is partially explained by the\r\nsuggestion afterwards made that instead of leaving the umpire to be\r\nchosen by some friendly European power it might be better that he\r\nshould be elected by the members of the commission themselves, and a\r\nmodification is then proposed that \"the commission shall be instructed\r\nto look for highlands which both parties might acknowledge as fulfilling\r\nthe conditions of the treaty.\" The American proposition is intended--and\r\nit agreed to would doubtless be successful--to decide the question of\r\nboundary definitively by the adoption of the highlands reported by the\r\ncommissioners of survey, and would thus secure the treaty line. The\r\nBritish modification looks to no such object. It merely contemplates\r\na commission of boundary analogous to that appointed under the fifth\r\narticle of the treaty of Ghent, and would in all probability prove\r\nequally unsatisfactory in practice. Whether highlands such as are\r\ndescribed in the treaty do or do not exist, it can scarcely be hoped\r\nthat those called for by the modified instructions could be found.\r\nThe fact that this question is still pending, although more than half\r\na century has elapsed since the conclusion of the treaty in which it\r\noriginated, renders it in the highest degree improbable that the two\r\nGovernments can unite in believing that either the one or the other of\r\nthe ranges of highlands claimed by the respective parties fulfills the\r\nrequired conditions of that instrument. The opinions of the parties have\r\nbeen over and over again expressed on this point and are well known to\r\ndiffer widely. The commission can neither reconcile nor change these\r\nvariant opinions resting on conviction, nor will it be authorized to\r\ndecide the difference. Under these impressions of the inefficiency of\r\nsuch a commission was the inquiry made in the letter of the undersigned\r\nof 5th March, 1836, as to the manner in which the report of the\r\ncommission, as proposed to be constituted and instructed by Her\r\nMajesty's Government, was expected to lead to an ultimate settlement of\r\nthe question of boundary. The results which the American proposition\r\npromised to secure were fully and frankly explained in previous notes\r\nfrom the Department of State, and had its advantages not been clearly\r\nunderstood this Government would not have devolved upon that of Her\r\nMajesty the task of illustrating them. Mr. Fox will therefore see that\r\nalthough the proposal to appoint a commission had its origin with\r\nthis Government the modification of the American proposition was, as\r\nunderstood by the undersigned, so fundamentally important that it\r\nentirely changed its nature, and that the supposition, therefore, that\r\nit was rather for the Government of the United States than for that\r\nof Great Britain to answer the inquiry referred to is founded in\r\nmisapprehension. Any decision made by a commission constituted in the\r\nmanner proposed by the United States and instructed to seek for the\r\nhighlands of the treaty of 1783 would be binding upon this Government\r\nand could without unnecessary delay be carried into effect; but if the\r\nsubstitute presented by Her Majesty's Government be insisted on and its\r\nprinciples be adopted, a resort will then be necessary to the State of\r\nMaine for her assent to all proceedings hereafter in relation to this\r\nmatter, since if any arrangement can be made under it it can only be\r\nfor a conventional line, to which she must of course be a party.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned, in conclusion, is instructed to inform Mr. Fox\r\nthat if a negotiation be entertained at all upon the inconclusive and\r\nunsatisfactory basis afforded by the British counter proposition or\r\nsubstitute, which possesses hardly a feature in common with the American\r\nproposition, the President will not venture to invite it unless the\r\nauthorities of the State of Maine, to whom, as before stated, it will\r\nbe forthwith submitted, shall think it more likely to lead to a final\r\nadjustment of the question of boundary than the General Government deems\r\nit to be, though predisposed to see it in the most favorable light.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned avails himself of the occasion to renew to Mr. Fox the\r\nassurance of his distinguished consideration.\r\n\r\nJOHN FORSYTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE,\r\n\r\n_Washington, March 1, 1838_.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency EDWARD KENT,\r\n\r\n_Governor of the State of Maine_.\r\n\r\nSIR: The discussions between the Federal Government and that of Great\r\nBritain in respect to the northeastern boundary of the United States\r\nhave arrived at a stage in which the President thinks it due to the\r\nState of Maine and necessary to the intelligent action of the General\r\nGovernment to take the sense of that State in regard to the expediency\r\nof opening a direct negotiation for the establishment of a conventional\r\nline, and if it should deem an attempt to adjust the matter of\r\ncontroversy in that form advisable, then to ask its assent to the same.\r\nWith this view and to place the government of Maine in full possession\r\nof the present state of the negotiation and of all the discussions that\r\nhave been had upon the subject, the accompanying documents are\r\ncommunicated, which, taken in connection with those heretofore\r\ntransmitted, will be found to contain that information.\r\n\r\nThe principles which have hitherto governed every successive\r\nAdministration of the Federal Government in respect to its powers and\r\nduties in the matter are--\r\n\r\nFirst. That it has power to settle the boundary line in question with\r\nGreat Britain upon the principles and according to the stipulations\r\nof the treaty of 1783, either by direct negotiation or, in case of\r\nascertained inability to do so, by arbitration, and that it is its duty\r\nto make all proper efforts to accomplish this object by one or the other\r\nof those means.\r\n\r\nSecond. That the General Government is not competent to negotiate,\r\nunless, perhaps, on grounds of imperious public necessity, a\r\nconventional line involving a cession of territory to which the State\r\nof Maine is entitled, or the exchange thereof for other territory not\r\nincluded within the limits of that State according to the true\r\nconstruction of the treaty, without the consent of the State.\r\n\r\nIn these views of his predecessors in office the President fully\r\nconcurs, and it is his design to continue to act upon them.\r\n\r\nThe attention of the Federal Government has, of course, in the first\r\ninstance been directed to efforts to settle the treaty line. A\r\nhistorical outline of the measures which have been successively taken\r\nby it to that end may be useful to the government of Maine in coming\r\nto a conclusion on the proposition now submitted. It will, however, be\r\nunnecessary here to do more than advert to the cardinal features of this\r\nprotracted negotiation.\r\n\r\nThe treaty of peace between the United States of America and His\r\nBritannic Majesty, concluded at Paris in September, 1783, defines the\r\nboundaries of the said States, and the following words, taken from the\r\nsecond article of that instrument, are intended to designate a part\r\nof the boundary between those States and the British North American\r\nProvinces, viz: \"From the northwest angle of Nova Scotia, viz, that\r\nangle which is formed by a line drawn due north from the source of the\r\nSt. Croix River to the highlands; along the said highlands which divide\r\nthose rivers that empty themselves into the river St. Lawrence from\r\nthose which fall into the Atlantic Ocean to the northwesternmost head of\r\nConnecticut River;\" ... \"east by a line to be drawn along the middle of\r\nthe river St. Croix from its mouth in the Bay of Fundy to its source,\r\nand from its source directly north to the aforesaid highlands which\r\ndivide the rivers that fall into the Atlantic Ocean from those which\r\nfall into the river St. Lawrence.\" An immediate execution of some of\r\nthe provisions of this treaty was, however, delayed by circumstances on\r\nwhich it is now unnecessary to dwell, and in November, 1794, a second\r\ntreaty was concluded between the two powers. In the meantime, doubts\r\nhaving arisen as to what river was truly intended under the name of the\r\nSt. Croix mentioned in the treaty of peace and forming a part of the\r\nboundary therein described, this question was referred by virtue of\r\nthe fifth article of the new treaty to the decision of a commission\r\nappointed in the manner therein prescribed, both parties agreeing to\r\nconsider such decision final and conclusive. The commissioners appointed\r\nin pursuance of the fifth article of the treaty of 1794 decided by\r\ntheir declaration of October 25, 1798, that the northern branch\r\n(Cheputnaticook) of a river called Scoodiac was the true river St. Croix\r\nintended by the treaty of peace.\r\n\r\nAt the date of the treaty of Ghent, December 24, 1814, the whole of\r\nthe boundary line from the source of the river St. Croix to the most\r\nnorthwesternmost point of the Lake of the Woods still remained\r\nunascertained, and it was therefore agreed to provide for a final\r\nadjustment thereof. For this purpose the appointment of commissioners\r\nwas authorized by the fifth article of the treaty of Ghent, with power\r\nto ascertain and determine the northwest angle of Nova Scotia and the\r\nnorthwestern-most head of Connecticut River, in conformity with the\r\nprovisions of the treaty of 1783, and to cause the boundary from the\r\nsource of the river St. Croix to the river Iroquois or Cateraguy to be\r\nsurveyed and marked according to the said provisions, etc. In the event\r\nof the commissioners differing, or both or either of them failing to\r\nact, the same article made provision for a reference to a friendly\r\nsovereign or state. Commissioners were appointed under this article in\r\n1815-16, but although their sessions continued several years, they were\r\nunable to agree on any of the matters referred to them. Separate reports\r\nwere accordingly made to both Governments of the two commissioners in\r\n1822, stating the points on which they differed and the grounds upon\r\nwhich their respective opinions had been formed. The case having thus\r\nhappened which made it necessary to refer the points of difference to a\r\nfriendly sovereign or state, it was deemed expedient by the parties to\r\nregulate this reference by a formal arrangement. A convention for the\r\npurpose was therefore concluded on the 29th of September, 1827, and the\r\ntwo Governments subsequently agreed in the choice of His Majesty the\r\nKing of the Netherlands as arbiter, who consented to act as such. The\r\nsubmission of the points of difference, three in number, was accordingly\r\nmade to that Sovereign, and his award, or rather written opinion on the\r\nquestions submitted to him, was rendered on the 10th of January, 1831.\r\nOn the 7th of December following the President communicated the award\r\nof the arbiter to the Senate of the United States for the advice and\r\nconsent of that body as to its execution, and at the same time intimated\r\nthe willingness of the British Government to abide by it. The result was\r\na determination on the part of the Senate not to consider the decision\r\nof His Netherland Majesty obligatory and a refusal to advise and consent\r\nto its execution. They, however, passed a resolution in June, 1832,\r\nadvising the President to open a new negotiation with His Britannic\r\nMajesty's Government for the ascertainment of the boundary between the\r\npossessions of the two powers on the northeastern frontier of the United\r\nStates according to the definitive treaty of peace. Of the negotiation\r\nsubsequent to this event it is deemed proper to take a more particular\r\nnotice.\r\n\r\nIn July the result of the action of the Senate in relation to the award\r\nwas communicated to Mr. Bankhead, the British chargé d'affaires, and he\r\nwas informed that the resolution had been adopted in the conviction that\r\nthe sovereign arbiter, instead of deciding the questions submitted to\r\nhim, had recommended a specified compromise of them. The Secretary of\r\nState at the same time expressed the desire of the President to enter\r\ninto further negotiation in pursuance of the resolution of the Senate,\r\nand proposed that the discussion should be carried on at Washington. He\r\nalso said that if the plenipotentiaries of the two parties should fail\r\nin this new attempt to agree upon the line intended by the treaty of\r\n1783 there would probably be less difficulty than before in fixing a\r\nconvenient boundary, as measures were in progress to obtain from the\r\nState of Maine more extensive powers than were before possessed, with\r\na view of overcoming the constitutional obstacles which had opposed\r\nthemselves to such an arrangement; and he further intimated that the\r\nnew negotiation would naturally embrace the important question of the\r\nnavigation of the river St. John.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1833, Sir Charles R. Vaughan, the British minister,\r\naddressed a note to the Department of State, in which, hopeless of\r\nfinding out by a new negotiation an assumed line of boundary which\r\nso many attempts had been fruitlessly made to discover, he wished to\r\nascertain, first, the principle of the plan of boundary which the\r\nAmerican Government appeared to contemplate as likely to be more\r\nconvenient to both parties than those hitherto discussed, and, secondly,\r\nwhether any, and what, arrangement for avoiding the constitutional\r\ndifficulty alluded to had yet been concluded with the State of Maine.\r\nSatisfactory answers on these points, he said, would enable the British\r\nGovernment to decide whether it would entertain the proposition, but His\r\nMajesty's Government could not consent to embarrass the negotiation\r\nrespecting the boundary by mixing up with it a discussion regarding the\r\nnavigation of the St. John as an integral part of the same question or\r\nas necessarily connected with it.\r\n\r\nIn reply to this note, Mr. Livingston, under date of the 30th of April,\r\nstated that the arrangement spoken of in his previous communication, by\r\nwhich the Government of the United States expected to be enabled to\r\ntreat for a more convenient boundary, had not been effected, and that\r\nas the suggestion in regard to the navigation of the St. John was\r\nintroduced merely to form a part of the system of compensations in\r\nnegotiating for such a boundary if that of the treaty should be\r\nabandoned, it would not be insisted on.\r\n\r\nThe proposition of the President for the appointment of a joint\r\ncommission, with an umpire, to decide upon all points on which the\r\ntwo Governments disagree was then presented. It was accompanied by a\r\nsuggestion that the controversy might be terminated by the application\r\nto it of the rule for surveying and laying down the boundaries of tracts\r\nand of countries designated by natural objects, the precise situation\r\nof which is not known, viz, that the natural objects called for as\r\nterminating points should first be found, and that the lines should then\r\nbe drawn to them from the given points with the least possible departure\r\nfrom the course prescribed in the instrument describing the boundary.\r\nTwo modes were suggested in which such commission might be constituted:\r\nFirst, that it should consist of commissioners to be chosen in equal\r\nnumbers by the two parties, with an umpire selected by some friendly\r\nsovereign from among the most skillful men in Europe; or, secondly, that\r\nit should be entirely composed of such men so selected, to be attended\r\nin the survey and view of the country by agents appointed by the\r\nparties. This commission, it was afterwards proposed, should be\r\nrestricted to the simple question of determining the point designated\r\nby the treaty as the highlands which divide the waters that fall into\r\nthe Atlantic from those which flow into the St. Lawrence; that these\r\nhighlands should be sought for in a north or northwest direction from\r\nthe source of the St. Croix, and that a straight line to be drawn from\r\nthe monument at the head of that river to those highlands should be\r\nconsidered, so far as it extends, as a part of the boundary in question.\r\nThe commissioners were then to designate the course of the line along\r\nthe highlands and to fix on the northwesternmost head of the Connecticut\r\nRiver.\r\n\r\nIn a note of 31st May the British minister suggested that this perplexed\r\nand hitherto interminable question could only be set at rest by an\r\nabandonment of the defective description of boundary contained in the\r\ntreaty, by the two Governments mutually agreeing upon a conventional\r\nline more convenient to both parties than those insisted upon by the\r\ncommissioners under the fifth article of the treaty of Ghent, or that\r\nsuggested by the King of the Netherlands.\r\n\r\nMr. McLane remarked in reply (June 5) that the embarrassments in tracing\r\nthe treaty boundary had arisen more from the principles assumed and\r\nfrom the manner of seeking for it than from any real defect in the\r\ndescription when properly understood; that in the present state of the\r\nbusiness the suggestion of Sir Charles R. Vaughan would add to the\r\nexisting difficulties growing out of a want of power in the General\r\nGovernment under the Constitution of the United States to dispose of\r\nterritory belonging to either of the States of the Union without the\r\nconsent of the State; that as a conventional line to the south of and\r\nconfessedly variant from that of the treaty would deprive the State of\r\nMaine of a portion of the territory she claims, it was not probable\r\nthat her consent to it would be given while there remained a reasonable\r\nprospect of discovering the line of the treaty of 1783, and that the\r\nPresident would not be authorized, after the recent proceedings in the\r\nSenate, to venture now to agree upon a conventional line without such\r\nconsent, whilst the proposition submitted in April afforded not only a\r\nfair prospect, but in his opinion the certain means, of ascertaining the\r\nboundary called for by the treaty of 1783 and of finally terminating all\r\nthe perplexities which have encompassed that subject.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1834, Sir Charles R. Vaughan, after submitting certain\r\nobservations intended to controvert the positions assumed by the United\r\nStates on the subject of the constitutional difficulty by which the\r\nAmerican Government was prevented from acquiescing in the arrangement\r\nrecommended by the King of the Netherlands for the settlement of the\r\nboundary in the neighborhood of the St. John, asserted that the two\r\nGovernments bound themselves by the convention of September, 1827,\r\nto submit to an arbiter certain points of difference relative to the\r\nboundary between the American and British dominions; that the arbiter\r\nwas called on to determine certain questions, and that if he has\r\ndetermined the greater part of the points submitted to him his decision\r\non them ought not to be set aside merely because he declares that one\r\nremaining point can not be decided in conformity with the words of the\r\ntreaty of 1783, and therefore recommends to the parties a compromise on\r\nthat particular point; that the main points referred to the arbiter were\r\nthree in number; that upon the second and third of these he made a plain\r\nand positive decision; that upon the remaining point he has declared\r\nthat it is impossible to find a spot or to trace a line which shall\r\nfulfill all the conditions required by the words of the treaty for the\r\nnorthwest angle of Nova Scotia and for the highlands along which the\r\nboundary from that angle is to be drawn; yet that in the course of his\r\nreasoning upon this point he has decided several questions connected\r\nwith it upon which the two parties had entertained different views, viz:\r\n\r\n\"First. The arbiter expresses his opinion that the term 'highlands' may\r\nproperly be applied not only to a hilly and elevated country, but to\r\na tract of land which, without being hilly, divides waters flowing in\r\ndifferent directions, and consequently, according to this opinion, the\r\nhighlands to be sought for are not necessarily a range of mountains,\r\nbut rather the summit level of the country.\r\n\r\n\"Second. The arbiter expresses his opinion that an inquiry as to what\r\nwere the ancient boundaries of the North American Provinces can be\r\nof no use for the present purpose, because those boundaries were not\r\nmaintained by the treaty of 1783 and had in truth never been distinctly\r\nascertained and laid down.\r\n\r\n\"Third. The arbiter declares that the northwest angle of Nova Scotia\r\nmentioned in the treaty of 1783 is not a point which was then known\r\nand ascertained; that it is not an angle which is created by the\r\nintersection of any lines of boundary at that time acknowledged as\r\nexisting, but that it is an angle still to be found and to be created\r\nby the intersection of new lines, which are hereafter to be drawn in\r\npursuance of the stipulations of the treaty; and further, that the\r\nnature of the country eastward of the said angle affords no argument\r\nfor laying that angle down in one place rather than in another.\r\n\r\n\"Fourth. He states that no just argument can be deduced for the\r\nsettlement of this question from the exercise of the rights of\r\nsovereignty over the fief of Madawaska and over the Madawaska\r\nsettlement.\r\n\r\n\"Fifth. He declares that the highlands contemplated in the treaty should\r\ndivide immediately, and not mediately, rivers flowing into the St.\r\nLawrence and rivers flowing into the Atlantic, and that the word\r\n'divide' requires contiguity of the things to be divided.\r\n\r\n\"Sixth. He declares that rivers falling into the Bay of Chaleurs and\r\nthe Bay of Fundy can not be considered according to the meaning of the\r\ntreaty as rivers flowing into the Atlantic, and specifically that the\r\nrivers St. John and Restigouche can not be looked upon as answerable to\r\nthe latter description.\r\n\r\n\"Seventh. He declares that neither the line of boundary claimed by Great\r\nBritain nor that claimed by the United States can be adjudged as the\r\ntrue line without departing from the principles of equity and justice as\r\nbetween the two parties.\"\r\n\r\nIt was the opinion of His Majesty's Government, Sir Charles alleged,\r\nthat the decisions of the arbiter upon the second and third points\r\nreferred to him, as well as upon the subordinate questions, ought to be\r\nacquiesced in by the two Governments, and that in any future attempt to\r\nestablish a boundary, whether in strict conformity with the words of the\r\ntreaty of 1783 or by agreeing to the mode of settlement recommended by\r\nthe arbiter, it would be necessary to adopt these seven decisions as\r\na groundwork for further proceedings; that the British Government,\r\ntherefore, previously to any further negotiation, claimed from the\r\nGovernment of the United States an acquiescence in the decisions\r\npronounced by the arbiter upon all those points which he had decided,\r\nand as a preliminary to any attempt to settle the remaining point by\r\nnegotiation to be satisfied that the Federal Government was possessed of\r\nthe necessary powers to carry into effect any arrangement upon which the\r\ntwo parties might agree.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the proposition made by the American Government, Sir\r\nCharles thought that the difficulty which was found insurmountable as\r\nagainst the line recommended by the King of the Netherlands, viz., the\r\nwant of authority to agree to any line which might imply a cession of\r\nany part of the territory to which the treaty as hitherto interpreted by\r\nthe United States might appear to entitle one of the component States of\r\nthe Union, would be equally fatal to that suggested by Mr. Livingston,\r\nsince a line drawn from the head of the St. Croix to highlands found to\r\nthe westward of the meridian of that spot would not be the boundary of\r\nthe treaty and might be more justly objected to by Maine and with more\r\nappearance of reason than that proposed by the arbiter.\r\n\r\nThe reply of Mr. McLane to the preceding note is dated on the 11th of\r\nMarch. He expressed his regret that His Britannic Majesty's Government\r\nshould still consider any part of the opinion of the arbiter obligatory\r\non either party. Those opinions, the Secretary stated, could not have\r\nbeen carried into effect by the President without the concurrence of the\r\nSenate, who, regarding them not only as not determining the principal\r\nobject of the reference, but as in fact deciding that object to be\r\nimpracticable, and therefore recommending to the two parties a boundary\r\nnot even contemplated either by the treaty or by the reference nor\r\nwithin the power of the General Government to take, declined to give\r\ntheir advice and consent to the execution of the measures recommended by\r\nthe arbiter, but did advise the Executive to open a new negotiation for\r\nthe ascertainment of the boundary in pursuance of the treaty of 1783,\r\nand the proposition of Mr. Livingston, submitted in his letter of 30th\r\nof April, 1833, accordingly proceeded upon that basis. Mr. McLane denied\r\nthat a decision, much less the expression of an opinion, by the arbiter\r\nupon some of the disputed points, but of a character not to settle the\r\nreal controversy, was binding upon either party, and he alleged that\r\nthe most material point in the line of the true boundary, both as it\r\nrespects the difficulty of the subject and the extent of territory and\r\ndominions of the respective Governments, the arbiter not only failed to\r\ndecide, but acknowledged his inability to decide, thereby imposing upon\r\nboth Governments the unavoidable necessity of resorting to further\r\nnegotiation to ascertain the treaty boundary and absolving each party\r\nfrom any obligation to adopt his recommendations. The Secretary also\r\ndeclined to admit that of the three main points referred to the arbiter\r\nas necessary to ascertain the boundary of the treaty he had decided two.\r\nOn the first point, Mr. McLane said, it was not contended a decision was\r\nmade or that either the angle or the highlands called for by the treaty\r\nwas found, and on the third point an opinion merely was expressed that\r\nit would be suitable to proceed to fresh operations to measure the\r\nobserved latitude, etc.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary admitted that if the American proposition should be\r\nacceded to by His Majesty's Government and the commission hereafter to\r\nbe appointed should result in ascertaining the true situation of the\r\nboundary called for by the treaty of 1783, that it would be afterwards\r\nnecessary, in order to ascertain the true line, to settle the other two\r\npoints according to which it should be traced. He therefore offered,\r\nif the American proposition should be acceded to, notwithstanding the\r\nobligatory effect of the decision of the arbiter on the point is denied,\r\n\"to take the stream situated farthest to the northwest among those which\r\nfall into the northernmost of the three lakes, the last of which bears\r\nthe name of Connecticut Lake, as the north-westernmost head of the\r\nConnecticut River according to the treaty of 1783;\" and as it respects\r\nthe third point referred to the arbiter, the line of boundary on the\r\nforty-fifth degree of latitude, but upon which he failed to decide, the\r\nPresident would agree, if the proposition as to the first point was\r\nembraced, to adopt the old line surveyed and marked by Valentine and\r\nCollins in 1771 and 1772.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary then proceeded to state further and insuperable objections\r\nto an acquiescence by the United States in the opinions supposed to have\r\nbeen pronounced by the arbiter in the course of his reasoning upon the\r\nfirst point submitted to him. He remarked that the views expressed\r\nby the arbiter on these subordinate matters could not be regarded as\r\ndecisions within the meaning of the reference, but rather as postulates\r\nor premises, by which he arrived at the opinion expressed in regard to\r\nthe point in dispute. By an acquiescence in them, therefore, as required\r\nby Great Britain, the United States would reject as erroneous the\r\nconclusion of the arbiter, whilst they would adopt the premises and\r\nreasoning by which it was attained--that the seven postulates or\r\npremises presented as necessary to be considered by the United States\r\nare but part of those on which the arbiter was equally explicit in\r\nthe expression of his views, that on others his reasoning might be\r\nconsidered as more favorable to the pretensions of this Government, and\r\nthat no reason was perceived why an acquiescence in his opinions upon\r\nthem should not equally apply to all the premises assumed by him and be\r\nbinding upon both parties. Mr. McLane was, however, persuaded that there\r\nwas no obligation on either Government to acquiesce in the opinion of\r\nthe arbiter on any of the matters involved in his premises; that such\r\nacquiescence would defeat the end of the present negotiation, and that\r\nas it appeared to be mutually conceded that the arbiter had not been\r\nable to decide upon the first and most material point so as to make a\r\nbinding decision, there could certainly be no greater obligation to\r\nyield to his opinions on subordinate matters merely. The Secretary\r\nfurther observed that the most material point of the three submitted\r\nto the arbiter was that of the highlands, to which the President's\r\nproposition directly applies, and which are designated in the treaty of\r\npeace as the northwest angle of Nova Scotia, formed by a line drawn due\r\nnorth from the source of the St. Croix River to the highlands dividing\r\nthe rivers, etc.; that the arbiter found it impossible to decide this\r\npoint, and therefore recommended a new line, different from that called\r\nfor by the treaty of 1783, and which could only be established by\r\na conventional arrangement between the two Governments; that the\r\nGovernment of the United States could not adopt this recommendation\r\nnor agree upon a new and conventional line without the consent of the\r\nState of Maine; that the present negotiation proposed to ascertain the\r\nboundary according to the treaty of 1783, and for this purpose, however\r\nattained, the authority of the Government of the United States was\r\ncomplete; that the proposition offered by the Government of the United\r\nStates promised, in the opinion of the President, the means of\r\nascertaining the true line by discovering the highlands of the treaty,\r\nbut the British Government asked the United States as a preliminary\r\nconcession to acquiesce in the opinion of the arbiter upon certain\r\nsubordinate facts--a concession which would in effect defeat the\r\nsole object, not only of the proposition, but of the negotiation,\r\nviz, the determination of the boundary according to the treaty of 1783\r\nby confining the negotiation to a conventional line, to which this\r\nGovernment had not the authority to agree. Mr. McLane also said that\r\nif by a resort to the plain rule now recommended it should be found\r\nimpracticable to trace the boundary according to the definitive\r\ntreaty, it would then be time enough to enter upon a negotiation for a\r\nconventional substitute for it. He stated in answer to the suggestion of\r\nSir Charles R. Vaughan that the objection urged against the line of the\r\narbiter would equally lie against that suggested by Mr. Livingston; that\r\nthe authority of the Government to ascertain the true line of the treaty\r\nwas unquestionable, and that the American proposition, by confining the\r\ncourse to the natural object, would be a legitimate ascertainment of\r\nthat line.\r\n\r\nIn a note dated 16th March Sir Charles R. Vaughan offered some\r\nobservations upon the objections on the part of the United States to\r\nacquiesce in the points previously submitted to the American Government.\r\nHe said that the adoption of the views of the British Government by the\r\nGovernment of the United States was meant to be the groundwork of future\r\nproceedings, whether those proceedings were to be directed to another\r\nattempt to trace the boundary as proposed by the latter or to a division\r\nof the territory depending upon the conventional line. He maintained\r\nthat the arbiter had decided, as the British Government asserted, two\r\nout of the three main points submitted for his decision, viz, what\r\nought to be considered as the northwesternmost head of the Connecticut\r\n(but which the Government of the United States is only willing to admit\r\nconditionally) and the point relative to tracing the boundary along the\r\nforty-fifth degree of latitude. This point, he observed, Mr. McLane\r\nwished to dispose of by adopting the old line of Collins and Valentine,\r\nwhich was suspected of great inaccuracy by both parties, and the only\r\nmotive for retaining which was because some American citizens have made\r\nsettlements upon territory that a new survey might throw into the\r\npossession of Great Britain. Sir Charles denied that the acquiescence of\r\nthe United States in the seven subordinate points lately submitted by\r\nHis Majesty's Government would confine the negotiation to a conventional\r\nline, to which the President had no authority to agree, and affirmed\r\nthat not a step could be taken by the commissioners to be appointed\r\naccording to Mr. Livingston's proposition, notwithstanding the\r\nunlimited discretion which it was proposed to give them, unless the\r\ntwo Governments agreed upon two of the seven subordinate points--\"the\r\ncharacter of the land they are to discover as dividing waters according\r\nto the treaty of 1783 and what are to be considered as Atlantic rivers.\"\r\nIn answer to Mr. McLane's observation that on many points the reasoning\r\nof the arbiter had been more favorable to the United States than to\r\nGreat Britain, and that therefore acquiescence should equally apply to\r\nall the premises assumed, Sir Charles expressed his confidence that if\r\nacquiescence in them could facilitate the object which now occupied both\r\nGovernments they would meet with the most favored consideration. Sir\r\nCharles adverted to the obligations contracted under the seventh article\r\nof the convention, to the opinion of His Majesty's Government that they\r\nwere binding and its willingness to abide by the award of the arbiter.\r\nHe referred to the small majority by which he supposed the award to have\r\nbeen defeated in the Senate of the United States and a new negotiation\r\nadvised to be opened, to the complicated nature of the plan proposed\r\nby the United States for another attempt to trace the boundary of\r\nthe treaty, to the rejection of the points proposed by the British\r\nGovernment to render that plan more practicable, etc., and regretted\r\nsincerely that the award of the arbiter, which conferred upon the United\r\nStates three-fifths of the disputed territory, together with Rouses\r\nPoint--a much greater concession than is ever likely to be obtained\r\nby a protracted negotiation--was set aside. An alleged insuperable\r\nconstitutional difficulty having occasioned the rejection of the award,\r\nSir Charles wished to ascertain previously to any further proceedings\r\nhow far the General Government had the power to carry into effect any\r\narrangement resulting from a new negotiation, the answer of Mr. McLane\r\nupon this point having been confined to stating that should a new\r\ncommission of survey, freed from the restriction of following the due\r\nnorth line of the treaty, find anywhere westward of that line highlands\r\nseparating rivers according to the treaty of 1783, a line drawn from the\r\nmonument at the source of the St. Croix would be such a fulfillment of\r\nthe terms of that treaty that the President could agree to make it the\r\nboundary without reference to the State of Maine.\r\n\r\nMr. McLane, under date of 21st March, corrected the error into which Sir\r\nCharles had fallen in regard to the proceedings on the award in the\r\nSenate of the United States, and showed that that body not only failed,\r\nbut by two repeated votes of 35 and 34 to 8 refused, to consent to the\r\nexecution of the award, and by necessary implication denied its binding\r\neffect upon the United States, thus putting it out of the power of the\r\nPresident to carry it into effect and leaving the high parties to the\r\nsubmission situated precisely as they were prior to the selection of the\r\narbiter.\r\n\r\nThe President had perceived, Mr. McLane said, in all the previous\r\nefforts to adjust the boundary in accordance with the terms of the\r\ntreaty of 1783 that a natural and uniform rule in the settlement of\r\ndisputed questions of location had been quite overlooked; that the\r\nchief, if not only, difficulty arose from a supposed necessity of\r\nfinding highlands corresponding with the treaty description in a due\r\nnorth line from the monument, but it was plain that if such highlands\r\ncould be anywhere discovered it would be a legal execution of the treaty\r\nto draw a line to them from the head of the St. Croix without regard to\r\nthe precise course given in the treaty. It therefore became his duty to\r\nurge the adoption of this principle upon the Government of His Britannic\r\nMajesty as perhaps the best expedient which remained for ascertaining\r\nthe boundary of the treaty of 1783. The Secretary could not perceive\r\nin the plan proposed anything so complicated as Sir Charles appeared\r\nto suppose. On the contrary, it was recommended to approbation and\r\nconfidence by its entire simplicity. It chiefly required the discovery\r\nof the highlands called for by the treaty, and the mode of reaching\r\nthem upon the principle suggested was so simple that no observations\r\ncould make it plainer. The difficulty of discovering such highlands,\r\nMr. McLane said, was presumed not to be insuperable. The arbiter himself\r\nwas not understood to have found it impracticable to discover highlands\r\nanswering the description of the highlands of the treaty, though unable\r\nto find them due north from the monument; and certainly it could not be\r\nmore difficult for commissioners on the spot to arrive at a conclusion\r\nsatisfactory to their own judgment as to the locality of the highlands.\r\n\r\nMr. McLane, in answer to Sir Charles's request for information on the\r\nsubject, stated that the difficulty in the way of the adoption of\r\nthe line recommended by the arbiter was the want of authority in the\r\nGovernment of the United States to agree to a line not only confessedly\r\ndifferent from the line called for by the treaty, but which would\r\ndeprive the State of Maine of a portion of territory to which she would\r\nbe entitled according to the line of the definitive treaty; that by the\r\nPresident's proposition a commission would be raised, not to establish\r\na new line differing from the treaty of 1783, but to determine what\r\nthe true and original boundary was and in which of the two disagreeing\r\nparties the right to the disputed territory originally was; that for\r\nthis purpose the authority of the original commissioners, if they could\r\nhave agreed, was complete under the Ghent treaty, and that of the new\r\ncommission proposed to be constituted could not be less.\r\n\r\nSir Charles R. Vaughan explained, under date of the 24th of March, with\r\nregard to his observation \"that the mode in which it was proposed by the\r\nUnited States to settle the boundary was complicated; that he did not\r\nmean to apply it to the adoption of a rule in the settlement of disputed\r\nquestions of location, but to the manner in which it is proposed by the\r\nUnited States that the new commission of survey shall be selected and\r\nconstituted.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of December, 1834, Sir Charles R. Vaughan transmitted a note\r\nto the Department of State, in which, after a passing expression of the\r\nregret of His Majesty's Government that the American Government still\r\ndeclined to come to a separate understanding on the several points of\r\ndifference with respect to which the elements of decision were fully\r\nbefore both Governments, but without abandoning the argument contained\r\nin his note of 10th February last, he addressed himself exclusively to\r\nthe American proposition for the appointment of a new commission to be\r\nempowered to seek westward of the meridian of the St. Croix highlands\r\nanswering to the description of those mentioned in the treaty of 1783.\r\nHe stated with regard to the rule of surveying on which the proposition\r\nwas founded that however just and reasonable it might be, His Majesty's\r\nGovernment did not consider it so generally established and recognized\r\nas Mr. McLane assumed it to be; that, indeed, no similar case was\r\nrecollected in which the principle asserted had been put in practice;\r\nyet, on the contrary, one was remembered not only analogous to that\r\nunder discussion, but arising out of the same article of the same\r\ntreaty, in which the supposed rule was invested by the agents of the\r\nAmerican Government itself; that the treaty of 1783 declared that the\r\nline of boundary was to proceed from the Lake of the Woods \"in a due\r\nwest course to the Mississippi,\" but it being ascertained that such\r\na line could never reach that river, since its sources lie south of\r\nthe latitude of the Lake of the Woods, the commissioners, instead of\r\nadhering to the natural object--the source of the Mississippi--and\r\ndrawing a new connecting line to it from the Lake of the Woods, adhered\r\nto the arbitrary line to be drawn due west from the lake and abandoned\r\nthe Mississippi, the specific landmark mentioned in the treaty.\r\n\r\nSir Charles further stated that if the President was persuaded that he\r\ncould carry out the principle of surveying he had proposed without the\r\nconsent of Maine, and if no hope remained, as was alleged by Mr. McLane,\r\nof overcoming the constitutional difficulty in any other way until at\r\nleast this proposition should have been tried and have failed, His\r\nMajesty's Government, foregoing their own doubts on the subject, were\r\nready to acquiesce in the proceeding proposed by the President if that\r\nproceeding could be carried into effect in a manner not otherwise\r\nobjectionable; that \"His Majesty's Government would consider it\r\ndesirable that the principles on which the new commissioners would have\r\nto conduct their survey should be settled beforehand by a special\r\nconvention between the two Governments;\" that there was, indeed, one\r\npreliminary question upon which it was obviously necessary the two\r\nGovernments should agree before the commission could begin their survey\r\nwith any chance of success, viz, What is the precise meaning to be\r\nattached to the words employed in the treaty to define the highlands\r\nwhich the commissioners are to seek for? that those highlands are to be\r\ndistinguished from other highlands by the rivers flowing from them, and\r\nthose distinguishing rivers to be known from others by the situation\r\nof their mouths; that with respect to the rivers flowing south into\r\nthe Atlantic Ocean a difference of opinion existed between the two\r\nGovernments; that whilst the American Government contended that rivers\r\nfalling into the Bay of Fundy were, the British Government contended\r\nthat they were not, for the purposes of the treaty, rivers falling into\r\nthe Atlantic Ocean, and that the views and arguments of the British\r\nGovernment on this point had been confirmed by an impartial authority\r\nselected by the common consent of the two Governments, who was of\r\nopinion that the rivers St. John and Restigouche were not Atlantic\r\nrivers within the meaning of the treaty, and that His Majesty's\r\nGovernment therefore trusted that the American Cabinet would concur with\r\nthat of His Majesty in deciding \"that the Atlantic rivers which are to\r\nguide the commissioners in searching for the highlands described in the\r\ntreaty are those which fall into the sea to the westward of the mouth of\r\nthe river St. Croix;\" that a clear agreement on this point must be an\r\nindispensable preliminary to the establishment of any new commission\r\nof survey; that till this point be decided no survey of commissioners\r\ncould lead to a useful result, but that its decision turns upon the\r\ninterpretation of the words of a treaty, and not upon the operations of\r\nsurveyors; and His Majesty's Government, having once submitted it, in\r\ncommon with other points, to the judgment of an impartial arbiter, by\r\nwhose award they had declared themselves ready to abide, could not\r\nconsent to refer it to any other arbitration.\r\n\r\nIn a note from the Department of State dated 28th April, 1835, Sir\r\nCharles R. Vaughan was assured that his prompt suggestion, as His\r\nBritannic Majesty's minister, that a negotiation should be opened for\r\nthe establishment of a conventional boundary between the two countries\r\nwas duly appreciated by the President, who, had he possessed like powers\r\nwith His Majesty's Government over the subject, would have met the\r\nsuggestion in a favorable spirit.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary observed that the submission of the whole subject or\r\nany part of it to a new arbitrator promised too little to attract the\r\nfavorable consideration of either party; that the desired adjustment of\r\nthe controversy was consequently to be sought for in the application of\r\nsome new principle to the controverted question, and that the President\r\nthought that by a faithful prosecution of the plan submitted by his\r\ndirection a settlement of the boundary in dispute according to the terms\r\nof the treaty of 1783 was attainable.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the rule of practical surveying offered as the basis of\r\nthe American proposition, he said if it should become material to do\r\nso--which was not to be anticipated--he would find no difficulty either\r\nin fortifying the ground occupied by this Government in this regard or\r\nin satisfying Sir Charles that the instance brought into notice by His\r\nBritannic Majesty's Government of a supposed departure from the rule\r\nwas not at variance with the assertion of Mr. Livingston repeated by\r\nMr. McLane. The Secretary therefore limited himself to the remark that\r\nthe line of demarcation referred to by Sir Charles was not established\r\nas the true boundary prescribed by the treaty of 1783, but was a\r\nconventional substitute for it, the result of a new negotiation\r\ncontrolled by other considerations than those to be drawn from that\r\ninstrument only.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary expressed the President's unfeigned regret upon learning\r\nthe decision of His Majesty's Government not to agree to the proposition\r\nmade on the part of the United States without a precedent compliance\r\nby them with inadmissible conditions. He said that the views of this\r\nGovernment in regard to this proposal of His Majesty's Government had\r\nbeen already communicated to Sir Charles R. Vaughan, and the President\r\nperceived with pain that the reasons upon which these opinions were\r\nfounded had not been found to possess sufficient force and justice to\r\ninduce the entire withdrawal of the objectionable conditions, but that,\r\non the contrary, while His Majesty's Government had been pleased to\r\nwaive for the present six of the seven opinions referred to, the\r\nremaining one, amongst the most important of them all, was still\r\ninsisted upon, viz, that the St. John and Restigouche should be treated\r\nby the supposed commission as not being Atlantic rivers according to the\r\nmeaning of those terms in the treaty. With reference to that part of Sir\r\nCharles's communication which seeks to strengthen the ground heretofore\r\ntaken on this point by the British Government by calling to its aid the\r\nsupposed confirmation of the arbiter, the Secretary felt himself\r\nwarranted in questioning whether the arbiter had ever given his opinion\r\nthat the rivers St. John and Restigouche can not be considered according\r\nto the meaning of the treaty as rivers falling into the Atlantic, and he\r\ninsisted that it was not the intention of the arbiter to express the\r\nopinion imputed to him.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary also informed Sir Charles that the President could not\r\nconsent to clog the submission with the condition proposed by Her\r\nMajesty's Government; that a just regard to the rights of the parties\r\nand a proper consideration of his own duties required that the new\r\nsubmission, if made, should be made without restriction or qualification\r\nupon the discretion of the commissioners other than such as resulted\r\nfrom established facts and the just interpretation of the definitive\r\ntreaty, and such as had been heretofore and were now again tendered to\r\nHis Britannic Majesty's Government; that he despaired of obtaining a\r\nbetter constituted tribunal than the one proposed; that he saw nothing\r\nunfit or improper in submitting the question as to the character in\r\nwhich the St. John and Restigouche were to be regarded to the decision\r\nof an impartial commission; that the parties had heretofore thought it\r\nproper so to submit it, and that it by no means followed that because\r\ncommissioners chosen by the parties themselves, without an umpire, had\r\nfailed to come to an agreement respecting it, that the same result would\r\nattend the efforts of a commission differently selected. The Secretary\r\nclosed his note by stating that the President had no new proposal\r\nto offer, but would be happy to receive any such proposition as His\r\nBritannic Majesty's Government might think it expedient to make, and by\r\nintimating that he was authorized to confer with Sir Charles whenever\r\nit might suit his convenience and comport with the instructions of his\r\nGovernment with respect to the treaty boundary or a conventional\r\nsubstitute for it.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of May, 1835, Sir Charles R. Vaughan expressed his regret\r\nthat the condition which His Majesty's Government had brought forward as\r\nan essential preliminary to the adoption of the President's proposal had\r\nbeen declared to be inadmissible by the American Government.\r\n\r\nSir Charles confidently appealed to the tenor of the language of the\r\naward of the arbiter to justify the inference drawn from it by His\r\nMajesty's Government in regard to that point in the dispute which\r\nrespects the rivers which are to be considered as falling directly\r\ninto the Atlantic. The acquiescence of the United States in what was\r\nunderstood to be the opinion of the arbiter was invited, he said,\r\nbecause the new commission could not enter upon their survey in search\r\nof the highlands of the treaty without a previous agreement between\r\nthe two Governments what rivers ought to be considered as falling into\r\nthe Atlantic, and that if the character in which the Restigouche and\r\nSt. John were to be regarded was a question to be submitted to the\r\ncommissioners the President's proposition would assume the character of\r\na new arbitration, which had been already objected to by the Secretary.\r\nSir Charles also stated that while His Majesty's Government had wished\r\nto maintain the decisions of the arbiter on subordinate points, their\r\nmention had not been confined to those decided in favor of British\r\nclaims; that the decisions were nearly balanced in favor of either\r\nparty, and the general result of the arbitration was so manifestly in\r\nfavor of the United States that to them were assigned three-fifths of\r\nthe territory in dispute and Rouses Point, to which they had voluntarily\r\nresigned all claim.\r\n\r\nSir Charles acknowledged with much satisfaction the Secretary's\r\nassurance that if the President possessed the same power as His\r\nMajesty's Government over the question of boundary he would have met\r\nthe suggestion of a conventional line, contained in Sir Charles's note\r\nof 31st May, 1833, in a favorable spirit. He lamented that the two\r\nGovernments could not coincide in the opinion that the removal of the\r\nonly difficulty in the relations between them was attainable by the last\r\nproposal of the President, as it was the only one in his power to offer\r\nin alleviation of the task of tracing the treaty line, to which the\r\nSenate had advised that any further negotiation should be restricted.\r\nHe said that he was ready to confer with the Secretary whenever it might\r\nbe convenient to receive him, and stated that as to any proposition\r\nwhich it might be the wish of the United States to receive from His\r\nMajesty's Government respecting a conventional substitute for the treaty\r\nof 1783, it would in the first instance, to avoid constitutional\r\ndifficulties in the way of the Executive, be necessary to obtain the\r\nconsent of Maine, an object which must be undertaken exclusively by the\r\nGeneral Government of the United States.\r\n\r\nMr. Bankhead, the British chargé d'affaires, in a note to the Department\r\ndated 28th December, 1835, stated that during the three years which had\r\nelapsed since the refusal of the Senate to agree to the award of the\r\nKing of the Netherlands, although the British Government had more than\r\nonce declared its readiness to abide by its offer to accept the award,\r\nthe Government of the United States had as often replied that on its\r\npart that award could not be agreed to; that the British Government\r\nnow considered itself by this refusal of the United States fully and\r\nentirely released from the conditional offer which it had made, and\r\nthat he was instructed distinctly to announce to the President that\r\nthe British Government withdrew its consent to accept the territorial\r\ncompromise recommended by the King of the Netherlands.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the American proposition for the appointment of a new\r\ncommission of exploration and survey, Mr. Bankhead could not see, since\r\nthe President found himself unable to admit the distinction between the\r\nBay of Fundy and the Atlantic Ocean, how any useful result could arise\r\nout of the proposed survey. He thought, on the contrary, that if it did\r\nnot furnish fresh subjects of difference between the two Governments it\r\ncould at best only bring the subject back to the same point at which it\r\nnow stood.\r\n\r\nTo the suggestion of the President that the commission of survey should\r\nbe empowered to decide the river question Mr. Bankhead said it was not\r\nin the power of His Majesty's Government to assent; that this question\r\ncould not properly be referred to such a commission, because it turned\r\nupon the interpretation to be put upon the words of the treaty of 1783,\r\nand upon the application of that interpretation to geographical facts\r\nalready well known and ascertained, and that therefore a commission of\r\nsurvey had no peculiar competency to decide such a question; that to\r\nrefer it to any authority would be to submit it to a fresh arbitration,\r\nand that if His Majesty's Government were prepared to agree to a fresh\r\narbitration, which was not the case, such arbitration ought necessarily,\r\ninstead of being confined to one particular point alone, to include all\r\nthe points in dispute between the two Governments; that His Majesty's\r\nGovernment could therefore only agree to such a commission provided\r\nthere were a previous understanding between the two Governments; that\r\nalthough neither should be required to give up its own interpretation\r\nof the river question, yet \"the commissioners should be instructed to\r\nsearch for highlands upon the character of which no doubt could exist\r\non either side.\"\r\n\r\nIf this modification of the President's proposal should not prove\r\nacceptable, Mr. Bankhead observed, the only remaining way of adjusting\r\nthe difference would be to abandon altogether the attempt to draw a line\r\nin conformity with the words of the treaty and to fix upon a convenient\r\nline, to be drawn according to equitable principles and with a view to\r\nthe respective interests and the convenience of the two parties. He\r\nstated that His Majesty's Government were perfectly ready to treat for\r\nsuch a line, and conceived that the natural features of the disputed\r\nterritory would afford peculiar facilities for drawing it; that His\r\nMajesty's Government would therefore propose an equal division of the\r\nterritory in dispute between Great Britain and the United States, and\r\nthat the general outline of such a division would be that the boundary\r\nbetween the two States should be drawn due north from the head of St.\r\nCroix River till it intersected the St. John; thence up the bed of the\r\nSt. John to the southernmost source of that river, and from that point\r\nit should be drawn to the head of the Connecticut River in such manner\r\nas to make the northern and southern allotments of the divided territory\r\nas nearly as possible equal to each other in extent.\r\n\r\nIn reply to the preceding note the Secretary, under date of February 29,\r\n1836, expressed the President's regret to find that His Britannic\r\nMajesty's Government adhered to its objection to the appointment of a\r\ncommission to be chosen in either of the modes heretofore proposed by\r\nthe United States and his conviction that the proposition on which it\r\nwas founded, \"that the river question was a treaty construction only,\"\r\nalthough repeated on various occasions by Great Britain, was\r\ndemonstrably untenable, and, indeed, only plausible when material and\r\nmost important words of description in the treaty are omitted in quoting\r\nfrom that instrument. He said that while His Majesty's Government\r\nmaintain their position agreement between the United States and Great\r\nBritain on this point was impossible; that the President was therefore\r\nconstrained to look to the new and conventional line offered in Mr.\r\nBankhead's note, but that in such a line the wishes and interests of\r\nMaine were to be consulted, and that the President could not in justice\r\nto himself or that State make any proposition utterly irreconcilable\r\nwith her previously well-known opinions on the subject; that the\r\nprinciple of compromise and equitable division was adopted by the King\r\nof the Netherlands in the line recommended by him, a line rejected by\r\nthe United States because unjust to Maine; and yet that line gave to\r\nGreat Britain little more than 2,000,000, while the proposition now made\r\nby His Majesty's Government secured to Great Britain of the disputed\r\nland more than 4,000,000 acres; that the division offered by Mr.\r\nBankhead's note was not in harmony with the equitable rule from which\r\nit is said to spring, and if it were in conformity with it could not\r\nbe accepted without disrespect to the previous decisions and just\r\nexpectations of Maine. The President was far from attributing this\r\nproposition, the Secretary said, to the desire of His Majesty's\r\nGovernment to acquire territory. He doubted not that the offer, without\r\nregard to the extent of territory falling to the north or south of the\r\nSt. John, was made by His Majesty's Government from a belief that the\r\nsubstitution of a river for a highland boundary would be useful in\r\npreventing territorial disputes in future; but although the President\r\ncoincided in this view of the subject he was compelled to decline the\r\nboundary proposed as inconsistent with the known wishes, rights, and\r\ndecisions of the State.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary concluded by stating that the President, with a view to\r\nterminate at once all controversy, and without regard to the extent of\r\nterritory lost by one party or acquired by the other, to establish a\r\ndefinite and indisputable line, would, if His Majesty's Government\r\nassented to it, apply to the State of Maine for its consent to make the\r\nriver St. John from its source to its mouth the boundary between Maine\r\nand His Britannic Majesty's dominions in that part of North America.\r\n\r\nMr. Bankhead acknowledged on the 4th March, 1836, the receipt of\r\nthis note from the Department, and said that the rejection of the\r\nconventional line proposed in his previous note would cause His\r\nMajesty's Government much regret. He referred the Secretary to that\r\npart of his note of the 28th December last wherein the proposition of\r\nthe President for a commission of exploration and survey was fully\r\ndiscussed, as it appeared to Mr. Bankhead that the Secretary had not\r\ngiven the modification on the part of His Majesty's Government of the\r\nAmerican proposition the weight to which it was entitled. He said that\r\nit was offered with the view of meeting as far as practicable the wishes\r\nof the President and of endeavoring by such a preliminary measure to\r\nbring about a settlement of the boundary upon a basis satisfactory to\r\nboth parties; that with this view he again submitted to the Secretary\r\nthe modified proposal of His Majesty's Government, remarking that the\r\ncommissioners who might be appointed were not to _decide_ upon points\r\nof difference, but merely to present to the respective Governments the\r\nresult of their labors, which, it was hoped and believed, would pave\r\nthe way for an ultimate settlement of the question.\r\n\r\nMr. Bankhead considered it proper to state frankly and clearly that the\r\nproposition offered in the last note from the Department to make the\r\nriver St. John from its source to its mouth the boundary between the\r\nUnited States and His Majesty's Province of New Brunswick was one to\r\nwhich the British Government, he was convinced, would never agree.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th March the Secretary expressed regret that his proposition to\r\nmake the river St. John the boundary between Maine and New Brunswick\r\nwould, in the opinion of Mr. Bankhead, be declined by his Government;\r\nthat the Government of the United States could not, however, relinquish\r\nthe hope that the proposal, when brought before His Majesty's cabinet\r\nand considered with the attention and deliberation due to its merits,\r\nwould be viewed in a more favorable light than that in which it appeared\r\nto have presented itself to Mr. Bankhead. If, however, the Secretary\r\nadded, this expectation should be disappointed, it would be necessary\r\nbefore the President consented to the modification of his previous\r\nproposition for the appointment of a commission of exploration and\r\nsurvey to be informed more fully of the views of the British Government\r\nin offering the modification, so that he might be enabled to judge how\r\nthe report of the commission (which as now proposed to be constituted\r\nwas not to decide upon points of difference) would be likely to lead\r\nto an ultimate settlement of the question of boundary, and also which\r\nof the modes proposed for the selection of commissioners was the one\r\nintended to be accepted, with the modification suggested by His\r\nBritannic Majesty's Government.\r\n\r\nIn January last Mr. Fox, the British minister at Washington, made a\r\ncommunication to the Department of State, in which, with reference to\r\nthe objection preferred by the American Government that it had no power\r\nwithout the consent of Maine to agree to the arrangement proposed by\r\nGreat Britain, since it would be considered by that State as equivalent\r\nto a cession of what she regarded as a part of her territory, he\r\nobserved that the objection of the State could not be admitted as valid,\r\nfor the principle on which it rested was as good for Great Britain as\r\nit was for Maine; that if the State was entitled to contend that until\r\nthe treaty line was determined the boundary claimed by Maine must be\r\nregarded as the right one, Great Britain was still more entitled to\r\ninsist on a similar pretension and to assert that until the line of the\r\ntreaty shall be established satisfactorily the whole of the disputed\r\nterritory ought to be considered as belonging to the British Crown,\r\nsince Great Britain was the original possessor, and all the territory\r\nwhich had not been proved to have been by treaty ceded by her must be\r\ndeemed to belong to her still. But Mr. Fox said the existence of these\r\nconflicting pretensions pointed out the expediency of a compromise; and\r\nwhy, he asked, as a conventional line different from that described in\r\nthe treaty was agreed to with respect to the boundary westward from the\r\nLake of the Woods, should such a line not be agreed to likewise for the\r\nboundary eastward from the Connecticut? Her Majesty's Government could\r\nnot, he added, refrain from again pressing this proposition upon the\r\nserious consideration of the United States as the arrangement best\r\ncalculated to effect a prompt and satisfactory settlement between\r\nthe two powers.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the American proposition to make the river St. John\r\nfrom its mouth to its source the boundary, Mr. Fox remarked that it was\r\ndifficult to understand upon what grounds any expectation could have\r\nbeen formed that such a proposal could be entertained by the British\r\nGovernment, for such an arrangement would give to the United States\r\neven greater advantages than they would obtain by an unconditional\r\nacquiescence in their claim to the whole of the disputed territory,\r\nbecause it would give to Maine all the disputed territory lying south of\r\nthe St. John, and in exchange for the remaining part of the territory\r\nlying to the north of the St. John would add to the State of Maine a\r\nlarge district of New Brunswick--a district smaller in extent, but much\r\nmore considerable in value, than the portion of the disputed territory\r\nwhich lies to the north of the St. John.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the proposition for the appointment of a commission of\r\nexploration and survey, Mr. Fox stated that Her Majesty's Government,\r\nwith little expectation that it could lead to a useful result, but\r\nunwilling to reject the only plan left which seemed to afford a chance\r\nof making a further advance in this matter, would not withhold their\r\nconsent to such a commission if the principle upon which it was to be\r\nformed and the manner in which it was to proceed could be satisfactorily\r\nsettled; that of the two modes proposed in which such a commission might\r\nbe constituted Her Majesty's Government thought the first, viz, that it\r\nmight consist of commissioners named in equal numbers by each of the two\r\nGovernments, with an umpire to be selected by some friendly European\r\npower, would be the best, but suggested that it might be better that the\r\numpire should be selected by the members of the commission themselves\r\nrather than that the two Governments should apply to a third power\r\nto make such a choice; that the object of this commission should be\r\nto explore the disputed territory in order to find within its limits\r\ndividing highlands which might answer the description of the treaty, the\r\nsearch to be made in a north and northwest line from the monument at\r\nthe head of the St. Croix; and that Her Majesty's Government had given\r\ntheir opinion that the commissioners should be instructed to look for\r\nhighlands which both parties might acknowledge as fulfilling the\r\nconditions of the treaty.\r\n\r\nIn answer to the inquiry how the report of the commission would,\r\naccording to the views of Her Majesty's Government, be likely when\r\nrendered to lead to an ultimate settlement of the boundary question,\r\nMr. Fox observed that since the proposal for the appointment of a\r\ncommission originated with the Government of the United States, it\r\nwas rather for that Government than the Government of Great Britain to\r\nanswer this question. Her Majesty's Government had already stated they\r\nhad little expectation that such a commission could lead to any useful\r\nresult, etc., but that Her Majesty's Government, in the first place,\r\nconceived that it was meant by the Government of the United States that\r\nif the commission should discover highlands answering to the description\r\nof the treaty a connecting line from them to the head of the St. Croix\r\nshould be deemed to be a portion of the boundary between the two\r\ncountries. Mr. Fox further referred the Secretary to the previous notes\r\nof Mr. McLane on the subject, in which it was contemplated as one of\r\nthe possible results of the proposed commission that such additional\r\ninformation might be obtained of the features of the country as might\r\nremove all doubt as to the impracticability of laying down a boundary\r\nin accordance with the letter of the treaty. Mr. Fox said that if\r\nthe investigations of the commission should show that there was no\r\nreasonable prospect of finding the line described in the treaty of 1783\r\nthe constitutional difficulties which now prevented the United States\r\nfrom agreeing to a conventional line might possibly be removed, and the\r\nway be thus prepared for a satisfactory settlement of the difference by\r\nequitable division of the territory; but, he added in conclusion, if the\r\ntwo Governments should agree to the appointment of such a commission,\r\nit would be necessary that their agreement should be by a convention,\r\nand it would be obviously indispensable that the State of Maine should\r\nbe an assenting party to the arrangement.\r\n\r\nIn acknowledging the receipt of Mr. Fox's communication at the\r\nDepartment he was informed (7th February) that the President\r\nexperienced deep disappointment in finding that the answer just\r\npresented on the part of the British Government to the proposition\r\nmade by this Government with the view of effecting the settlement of\r\nthe boundary question was so indefinite in its terms as to render it\r\nimpracticable to ascertain without further discussion what were the\r\nreal wishes and intentions of Her Majesty's Government respecting the\r\nappointment of a commission of exploration and survey, but that a copy\r\nof it would be transmitted to the executive of Maine for the purpose of\r\nascertaining the sense of the State authorities upon the expediency of\r\nmeeting the views of Her Majesty's Government so far as they were\r\ntherein developed.\r\n\r\nOccasion was taken at the same time to explain to Mr. Fox, in answer\r\nto the suggestion in his note of the 10th of January last, that the\r\nparallel of latitude adopted as a conventional substitute for the line\r\ndesignated in the treaty for the boundary westward from the Lake of the\r\nWoods passed over territory within the exclusive jurisdiction of the\r\nGeneral Government, without trenching upon the rights or claims of\r\nany member of the Union, and the legitimate power of the Government,\r\ntherefore, to agree to such line was held to be perfect, but that in\r\nacceding to a conventional line for the boundary eastward from the river\r\nConnecticut it would transcend its constitutional powers, since such a\r\nmeasure could only be carried into effect by violating the jurisdiction\r\nof a sovereign State and assuming to alienate a portion of the territory\r\nclaimed by such State.\r\n\r\nIn reply to the observation of Mr. Fox that it was difficult to\r\nunderstand upon what ground an expectation could have been entertained\r\nthat the proposition to make the St. John the boundary would be received\r\nby Her Majesty's Government, he was informed that the suggestion had\r\nbeen offered, as the proposition on the part of Great Britain that led\r\nto it was supposed to have been, with regard to the extent of territory\r\nlost or acquired by the respective parties, and in the hope that the\r\ngreat importance of terminating this controversy by establishing a\r\ndefinite and indisputable boundary would be seen and acknowledged by the\r\nBritish Government, and have a correspondent weight in influencing its\r\ndecision; that the suggestion in Mr. Bankhead's note of 28th December,\r\n1835, of a part of the river St. John as a portion of the general\r\noutline of a conventional boundary, apparently recognized the superior\r\nadvantages of a river over a highland boundary, and that no difficulty\r\nwas anticipated on the part of Her Majesty's Government in understanding\r\nthe grounds upon which such a proposal was expected to be entertained\r\nby it, since the precedent proposition of Mr. Bankhead just alluded to,\r\nalthough based upon the principle of an equal division between the\r\nparties, could not be justified by it, as it would have given nearly\r\ntwo-thirds of the disputed territory to Great Britain; that it was\r\ntherefore fair to presume that the river line, in the opinion of His\r\nMajesty's Government, presented advantages sufficient to counterbalance\r\nany loss of territory by either party that might accrue from its\r\nadoption; and it was also supposed that another recommendation of this\r\nline would be seen by Great Britain in the fact that whilst by its\r\nadoption the right of jurisdiction alone would have been yielded to the\r\nUnited States over that portion of New Brunswick south of the St. John,\r\nGreat Britain would have acquired the right of soil and jurisdiction of\r\nall the disputed territory north of that river.\r\n\r\nTo correct a misapprehension into which Mr. Fox appeared to have fallen,\r\nthe distinctive difference between the American proposition for a\r\ncommission and that proposition as subsequently modified by Great\r\nBritain was pointed out, and he was informed that although the proposal\r\noriginated with this Government, the modification was so fundamentally\r\nimportant that it entirely changed the nature of the proposition, and\r\nthat the supposition, therefore, that it was rather for the Government\r\nof the United States than for that of Great Britain to answer the\r\ninquiry preferred by the Secretary of State for information relative\r\nto the manner in which the report of the commission as proposed to be\r\nconstituted and instructed by the British Government might tend to a\r\npractical result was unfounded. Mr. Fox was also given to understand\r\nthat any decision made by a commission constituted in the manner\r\nproposed by the United States and instructed to seek for the highlands\r\nof the treaty of 1783 would be binding upon this Government and could\r\nbe carried into effect without unnecessary delay; but if the substitute\r\npresented by Her Majesty's Government should be insisted on and its\r\nprinciples be adopted, it would then be necessary to resort to the State\r\nof Maine for her assent in all proceedings relative to the matter, since\r\nany arrangement under it can only be for a conventional line to which\r\nshe must be a party.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it was intimated to Mr. Fox that if a negotiation be\r\nentertained by this Government at all upon the unsatisfactory basis\r\nafforded by the British counter proposition or substitute, the President\r\nwill not invite it unless the authorities of the State of Maine shall\r\nthink it more likely to lead to an adjustment of the question of\r\nboundary than the General Government deemed it to be, although\r\npredisposed to see it in the most favorable light.\r\n\r\nYour excellency will perceive that in the course of these proceedings,\r\nbut without abandoning the attempt to adjust the treaty line, steps\r\nnecessary, from the want of power in the Federal Government, of an\r\ninformal character, have been taken to test the dispositions of the\r\nrespective Governments upon the subject of substituting a conventional\r\nfor the treaty line. It will also be seen from the correspondence that\r\nthe British Government, despairing of a satisfactory adjustment of\r\nthe line of the treaty, avows its willingness to enter upon a direct\r\nnegotiation for the settlement of a conventional line if the assent\r\nof the State of Maine to that course can be obtained.\r\n\r\nWhilst the obligations of the Federal Government to do all in its power\r\nto effect a settlement of this boundary are fully recognized on its\r\npart, it has in the event of its being unable to do so specifically by\r\nmutual consent no other means to accomplish the object amicably than by\r\nanother arbitration, or a commission, with an umpire, in the nature of\r\nan arbitration. In the contingency of all other measures failing the\r\nPresident will feel it to be his duty to submit another proposition to\r\nthe Government of Great Britain to refer the decision of the question to\r\na third party. He would not, however, be satisfied in taking this final\r\nstep without having first ascertained the opinion and wishes of the\r\nState of Maine upon the subject of a negotiation for the establishment\r\nof a conventional line, and he conceives the present the proper time\r\nto seek it.\r\n\r\nI am therefore directed by the President to invite your excellency to\r\nadopt such measures as you may deem necessary to ascertain the sense\r\nof the State of Maine with respect to the expediency of attempting to\r\nestablish a conventional line of boundary between that State and the\r\nBritish possessions by direct negotiation between the Governments of\r\nthe United States and Great Britain, and whether the State of Maine\r\nwill agree, and upon what conditions, if she elects to prescribe any,\r\nto abide by such settlement if the same be made. Should the State of\r\nMaine be of opinion that additional surveys and explorations might\r\nbe useful either in leading to a satisfactory adjustment of the\r\ncontroversy according to the terms of the treaty or in enabling the\r\nparties to decide more understandingly upon the expediency of opening\r\na negotiation for the establishment of a line that would suit their\r\nmutual convenience and be reconcilable to their conflicting interests,\r\nand desire the creation for that purpose of a commission upon the\r\nprinciples and with the limited powers described in the letter of\r\nMr. Fox, the President will without hesitation open a negotiation\r\nwith Great Britain for the accomplishment of that object.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with high consideration, your excellency's\r\nobedient servant,\r\n\r\nJOHN FORSYTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _April 5, 1838_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit to the House of Representatives a report from the\r\nSecretary of State, with accompanying papers, in answer to their\r\nresolution of the 21st ultimo.\r\n\r\nM.

FOX, Esq., etc.\r\n\r\nSIR: By the direction of the President of the United States, I have the\r\nhonor to communicate to you a copy of the evidence furnished to this\r\nDepartment of an extraordinary outrage committed from Her Britannic\r\nMajesty's Province of Upper Canada on the persons and property of\r\ncitizens of the United States within the jurisdiction of the State of\r\nNew York. The destruction of the property and the assassination of\r\ncitizens of the United States on the soil of New York at the moment\r\nwhen, as is well known to you, the President was anxiously endeavoring\r\nto allay the excitement and earnestly seeking to prevent any unfortunate\r\noccurrence on the frontier of Canada have produced upon his mind the\r\nmost painful emotions of surprise and regret. It will necessarily form\r\nthe subject of a demand for redress upon Her Majesty's Government.\r\nThis communication is made to you under the expectation that through\r\nyour instrumentality an early explanation may be obtained from the\r\nauthorities of Upper Canada of all the circumstances of the transaction,\r\nand that by your advice to those authorities such decisive precautions\r\nmay be used as will render the perpetration of similar acts hereafter\r\nimpossible. Not doubting the disposition of the government of Upper\r\nCanada to do its duty in punishing the aggressors and preventing future\r\noutrage, the President nevertheless has deemed it necessary to order\r\na sufficient force on the frontier to repel any attempt of a like\r\ncharacter and to make known to you that if it should occur he can not be\r\nanswerable for the effects of the indignation of the neighboring people\r\nof the United States.\r\n\r\nI avail myself of this occasion, etc.\r\n\r\nJOHN FORSYTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Forsyth to Mr. Fox_.\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE,\r\n\r\n_Washington, January 9, 1838_.\r\n\r\nHENRY S.

A\r\nletter from Mr. George W. Pratt of the 10th of January, with inclosures\r\nrelating to the same subject, is also sent.\r\n\r\nI avail myself of this occasion to renew to you the assurance of my\r\ndistinguished consideration.\r\n\r\nJOHN FORSYTH.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: Omitted.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROCHESTER, _January 10, 1838_.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nSIR: Colonel McNab, having avowed that the steamboat _Caroline_ was\r\ndestroyed by his orders, justifies himself by the plea, sustained by\r\naffidavits, that hostilities were commenced from the American shore.\r\n\r\nI inclose you the affidavits[26] of four respectable citizens of\r\nRochester, who were present at the time, who contradict the assertions\r\nof Colonel McNab.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nGEO. W. PRATT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Fox to Mr. Forsyth_.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 6, 1838_.\r\n\r\nHon. JOHN FORSYTH, etc.\r\n\r\nSIR: With reference to the letters which, by direction of the President,\r\nyou addressed to me on the 5th and 19th ultimo, respecting the capture\r\nand destruction of the steamboat _Caroline_ by a Canadian force on the\r\nAmerican side of the Niagara River, within the jurisdiction of the State\r\nof New York, I have now the honor to communicate to you the copy of a\r\nletter upon that subject which I have received from Sir Francis Head,\r\nlieutenant-governor of the Province of Upper Canada, with divers reports\r\nand depositions annexed.\r\n\r\nThe piratical character of the steamboat _Caroline_ and the necessity of\r\nself-defense and self-preservation under which Her Majesty's subjects\r\nacted in destroying that vessel would seem to be sufficiently\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\nAt the time when the event happened the ordinary laws of the United\r\nStates were not enforced within the frontier district of the State of\r\nNew York. The authority of the law was overborne publicly by piratical\r\nviolence. Through such violence Her Majesty's subjects in Upper Canada\r\nhad already severely suffered, and they were threatened with still\r\nfurther injury and outrage. This extraordinary state of things appears\r\nnaturally and necessarily to have impelled them to consult their own\r\nsecurity by pursuing and destroying the vessel of their piratical enemy\r\nwheresoever they might find her.\r\n\r\nI avail myself of this occasion to renew to you the assurance of my high\r\nrespect and consideration.\r\n\r\nH.S. FOX.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTORONTO, UPPER CANADA, _January 8, 1838_.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency HENRY S. FOX,\r\n\r\n_Her Majesty's Minister, Washington_.\r\n\r\nSIR: I have the honor to inclose you the copy of a special message sent\r\nby His Excellency Governor Marcy to the legislature of the State of New\r\nYork, in relation to a matter on which your excellency will desire the\r\nearliest and most authentic information. The message only reached this\r\nplace yesterday, and I lose no time in communicating with your\r\nexcellency on the subject.\r\n\r\nThe governor of the State of New York complains of the cutting out\r\nand burning of the steamboat _Caroline_ by order of Colonel McNab,\r\ncommanding Her Majesty's forces at Chippewa, in the Province of Upper\r\nCanada, and of the destruction of the lives of some American citizens\r\nwho were on board of the boat at the time she was attacked.\r\n\r\nThe act complained of was done under the following circumstances:\r\n\r\nIn Upper Canada, which contains a population of about 450,000 souls, the\r\nmost perfect tranquillity prevailed up to the 4th day of December last,\r\nalthough in the adjoining Province of Lower Canada many of the French\r\nCanadian inhabitants had been in open rebellion against the Government\r\nfor about a month preceding.\r\n\r\nAt no time since the treaty of peace with the United States in 1815 had\r\nUpper Canada been more undisturbed. The real causes of the insurrection\r\nin Lower Canada, namely, the national antipathy of the French\r\ninhabitants, did not in any degree apply in the upper Province, whose\r\npopulation, like the British and American inhabitants of Lower Canada,\r\nwere wholly opposed to the revolt and anxious to render every service in\r\ntheir power in support of the Queen's, authority.\r\n\r\nIt had been reported to the Government some time before the 4th of\r\nDecember that in a remote portion of the home district a number of\r\npersons occasionally met and drilled with arms under leaders known to\r\nbe disaffected, but it was not believed by the Government that anything\r\nmore could be intended than to make a show of threatened revolt in order\r\nto create a diversion in favor of the rebels in Lower Canada.\r\n\r\nThe feeling of loyalty throughout this Province was known to be so\r\nprevalent and decided that it was not thought unsafe to forbear, for\r\nthe time at least, to take any notice of the proceedings of this party.\r\n\r\nOn the night of the 4th December the inhabitants of the city of Toronto\r\nwere alarmed by the intelligence that about 500 persons armed with\r\nrifles were approaching the city; that they had murdered a gentleman\r\nof great respectability in the highway, and had made several persons\r\nprisoners. The inhabitants rushed immediately to arms; there were no\r\nsoldiers in the Province and no militia had been called out. The home\r\ndistrict, from which this party of armed men came, contains 60,000\r\ninhabitants; the city of Toronto 10,000. In a few hours a respectable\r\nforce, although undisciplined, was collected and armed in self-defense,\r\nand awaited the threatened attack. It seems now to admit of no doubt\r\nthat if they had at once advanced against the insurgents they would have\r\nmet with no formidable resistance, but it was thought more prudent to\r\nwait until a sufficient force should be collected to put the success of\r\nan attack beyond question. In the meantime people poured in from all\r\nquarters to oppose the insurgents, who obtained no increase of numbers,\r\nbut, on the contrary, were deserted by many of their body in consequence\r\nof the acts of devastation and plunder into which their leader had\r\nforced them.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of December an overwhelming force of militia went against\r\nthem and dispersed them without losing a man, taking many prisoners,\r\nwho were instantly by my order released and suffered to depart to their\r\nhomes. The rest, with their leaders, fled; some have since surrendered\r\nthemselves to justice; many have been taken, and some have escaped from\r\nthe Province.\r\n\r\nIt was reported about this time that in the district of London a similar\r\ndisposition to rise had been observed, and in consequence a militia\r\nforce of about 400 men was sent into that district, where it was\r\nspeedily joined by three times as many of the inhabitants of the\r\ndistrict, who assembled voluntarily and came to their aid with the\r\ngreatest alacrity.\r\n\r\nIt was discovered that about 300 persons under Dr. Duncombe, an\r\nAmerican by birth, were assembled with arms, but before the militia\r\ncould reach them they dispersed themselves and fled. Of these by far the\r\ngreater came in immediately and submitted themselves to the Government,\r\ndeclaring that they had been misled and deceived, and praying for\r\nforgiveness.\r\n\r\nIn about a week perfect tranquillity was restored, and from that moment\r\nnot a man has been seen in arms against the Government in any part of\r\nthe Province, with the exception of the hostile aggression upon Navy\r\nIsland, which I shall presently notice; nor has there been the slightest\r\nresistance offered to the execution of legal process in a single\r\ninstance.\r\n\r\nAfter the dispersion of the armed insurgents near Toronto Mr. McKenzie,\r\ntheir leader, escaped in disguise to the Niagara River and crossed\r\nover to Buffalo. Reports had been spread there and elsewhere along the\r\nAmerican frontier that Toronto had been burnt and that the rebels were\r\ncompletely successful, but the falsehood of these absurd rumors was\r\nwell known before McKenzie arrived on the American side. It was known\r\nalso that the ridiculous attempt of 400 men to revolutionize a country\r\ncontaining nearly half a million inhabitants had been put down by the\r\npeople instantly and decidedly without the loss of a man.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, a number of American citizens in Buffalo and other towns\r\non the frontier of the State of New York enlisted as soldiers, with\r\nthe avowed object of invading Canada and establishing a provisional\r\ngovernment. Public meetings were held to forward this design of invading\r\na country with which the United States were at peace. Volunteers were\r\ncalled for, and arms, ammunition, and provisions were supplied by\r\ncontributions openly made. All this was in direct and flagrant violation\r\nof the express laws of the United States, as well as of the law of\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nThe civil authority of Buffalo offered some slight shew of resistance to\r\nthe movement, being urged to interpose by many of the most respectable\r\ncitizens. But no real impediment was offered, and on the 13th of\r\nDecember some hundreds of the citizens of the State of New York, as\r\nan armed body under the command of a Mr. Van Rensselaer, an American\r\ncitizen, openly invaded and took possession of Navy Island, a part of\r\nUpper Canada, situate in the Niagara River.\r\n\r\nNot believing that such an outrage would really be committed, no force\r\nwhatever was assembled at the time to counteract this hostile movement.\r\n\r\nIn a very short time this lawless band obtained from some of the\r\narsenals of the State of New York (clandestinely, as it is said) several\r\npieces of artillery and other arms, which in broad daylight were openly\r\ntransported to Navy Island without resistance from the American\r\nauthorities. The people of Buffalo and the adjacent country continued to\r\nsupply them with stores of various kinds, and additional men enlisted in\r\ntheir ranks.\r\n\r\nIn a few days their force was variously stated from 500 to 1,500, of\r\nwhom a small proportion were rebels who had fled from Upper Canada. They\r\nbegan to intrench themselves, and threatened that they would in a short\r\ntime make a landing on the Canadian side of the Niagara River.\r\n\r\nTo prevent this and to keep them in check a body of militia was hastily\r\ncollected and stationed on the frontier, under the command of Colonel\r\nCameron, assistant adjutant-general of militia, who was succeeded in\r\nthis command by Colonel McNab, the speaker of the house of assembly,\r\nan officer whose humanity and discretion, as well as his activity,\r\nhave been proved by his conduct in putting down the insurrection in the\r\nLondon district and have been acknowledged in warm terms of gratitude\r\nby the misguided persons who had surrendered themselves into his hands.\r\nHe received orders to act on the defensive only, and to be careful not\r\nto do any act which the American Government could justly complain of as\r\na breach of neutrality.\r\n\r\nAn official statement of the unfriendly proceedings at Buffalo was\r\nwithout delay (on the 13th December) made by me to his excellency the\r\ngovernor of the State of New York, to which no answer has been received.\r\nAnd after this open invasion of our territory, and when it became\r\nevident that nothing was effected at Buffalo for preventing the\r\nviolation of neutrality, a special messenger was sent to your excellency\r\nat Washington to urge your interposition in the matter. Sufficient time\r\nhas not yet elapsed to admit of his return. Soon after his departure\r\nthis band of outlaws on Navy Island, acting in defiance of the laws and\r\nGovernment of both countries, opened a fire from several pieces of\r\nordnance upon the Canadian shore, which in this part is thickly settled,\r\nthe distance from the island being about 600 yards and within sight of\r\nthe populous village of Chippewa. They put several balls (6-pound shot)\r\nthrough a house in which a party of militiamen were quartered and which\r\nis the dwelling house of Captain Usher, a respectable inhabitant. They\r\nkilled a horse on which a man at the time was riding, but happily did\r\nno further mischief, though they fired also repeatedly with cannon and\r\nmusketry upon our boats.\r\n\r\nThey continued daily to render their position more formidable, receiving\r\nconstant supplies of men and warlike stores from the State of New York,\r\nwhich were chiefly embarked at a landing place on the American main\r\nshore, called Fort Schlosser, nearly opposite to Navy Island. This place\r\nwas once, I believe, a military position, before the conquest of Canada\r\nfrom the French, but there is now neither fort nor village there, but\r\nmerely a single house occupied as a tavern, and a wharf in front of it,\r\nto which boats and vessels are moored. The tavern had been during these\r\nlawless proceedings a rendezvous for the band (who can not be called\r\nby any name more appropriate than pirates), and was in fact openly and\r\nnotoriously resorted to as their headquarters on the mainland, and is\r\nso to this time. On the 28th December positive information was given to\r\nColonel McNab by persons from Buffalo that a small steamboat called the\r\n_Caroline_, of about 50 tons burthen, had been hired by the pirates, who\r\ncalled themselves \"patriots,\" and was to be employed in carrying down\r\ncannon and other stores and in transporting men and anything else that\r\nmight be required between Fort Schlosser and Navy Island.\r\n\r\nHe resolved if she came down and engaged in this service to take or\r\ndestroy her. She did come down agreeably to the information he received.\r\nShe transported a piece of artillery and other stores to the island, and\r\nmade repeated passages during the day between the island and the main\r\nshore.\r\n\r\nIn the night he sent a party of militia in boats, with orders to take\r\nor destroy her. They proceeded to execute the order. They found the\r\n_Caroline_ moored to the wharf opposite to the inn at Fort Schlosser.\r\nIn the inn there was a guard of armed men to protect her--part of the\r\npirate force, or acting in their support. On her deck there was an armed\r\nparty and a sentinel, who demanded the countersign.\r\n\r\nThus identified as she was with the force which in defiance of the law\r\nof nations and every principle of natural justice had invaded Upper\r\nCanada and made war upon its unoffending inhabitants, she was boarded,\r\nand after a resistance in which some desperate wounds were inflicted\r\nupon the assailants she was carried. If any peaceable citizens of the\r\nUnited States perished in the conflict, it was and is unknown to the\r\ncaptors, and it was and is equally unknown to them whether any such were\r\nthere. Before this vessel was thus taken not a gun had been fired by the\r\nforce under the orders of Colonel McNab, even upon this gang of pirates,\r\nmuch less upon any peaceable citizen of the United States. It must\r\ntherefore have been a consciousness of the guilty service she was\r\nengaged in that led those who were employing her to think an armed guard\r\nnecessary for her defense. Peaceable citizens of the United States were\r\nnot likely to be found in a vessel so employed at such a place and in\r\nsuch a juncture, and if they were there their presence, especially\r\nunknown as it was to the captors, could not prevent, in law or reason,\r\nthis necessary act of self-defense.\r\n\r\nFifteen days had elapsed since the invasion of Upper Canada by a\r\nforce enlisted, armed, and equipped openly in the State of New York.\r\nThe country where this outrage upon the law of nations was committed\r\nis populous. Buffalo also contains 15,000 inhabitants. The public\r\nauthorities, it is true, gave no countenance to those flagrant acts, but\r\nit did not prevent them or in the slightest degree obstruct them further\r\nthan by issuing proclamations, which were disregarded.\r\n\r\nPerhaps they could not, but in either case the insult and injury to the\r\ninhabitants of Canada were the same and their right to defend themselves\r\nequally unquestionable.\r\n\r\nNo wanton injury was committed by the party who gallantly effected this\r\nservice. They loosed the vessel from the wharf, and finding they could\r\nnot tow her against the rapid current of the Niagara, they abandoned the\r\neffort to secure her, set her on fire, and let her drift down the\r\nstream.\r\n\r\nThe prisoners taken were a man who, it will be seen by the documents\r\naccompanying this dispatch, avowed himself to be a subject of Her\r\nMajesty, inhabiting Upper Canada, who had lately been traitorously in\r\narms in that Province, and, having fled to the United States, was then\r\non board for the purpose of going to the camp at Navy Island; and a boy,\r\nwho, being born in Lower Canada, was probably residing in the United\r\nStates, and who, being afraid to land from the boat in consequence of\r\nthe firing kept up by the guard on the shore, was placed in one of the\r\nboats under Captain Drew and taken over to our side, from whence he was\r\nsent home the next day by the Falls ferry with money given him to bear\r\nhis expenses.\r\n\r\nI send with this letter, first, a copy of my first communication to His\r\nExcellency Governor Marcy,[27] to which no reply has reached me; second,\r\nthe official reports, correspondence, and militia general order\r\nrespecting the destruction of the _Caroline_, with other documents;[27]\r\nthird, the correspondence between Commissary-General Arcularius, of the\r\nState of New York, respecting the artillery belonging to the government\r\nof the State of New York, which has been and is still used in making war\r\nupon this Province;[27] fourth, other correspondence arising out of the\r\npresent state of things on the Niagara frontier;[27] fifth, the special\r\nmessage of Governor Marcy.[27]\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from these documents that a high officer of the\r\ngovernment of the State of New York has been sent by his excellency\r\nthe governor for the express purpose of regaining possession of the\r\nartillery of that State which is now employed in hostile aggressions\r\nupon this portion of Her Majesty's dominions, and that, being aided and\r\nfavored, as he acknowledges, by the most friendly cooperation which the\r\ncommanding officer of Her Majesty's forces could give him, he has been\r\nsuccessfully defied by this army of American citizens, and has abandoned\r\nthe object of his mission in despair.\r\n\r\nIt can hardly fail also to be observed by your excellency that in\r\nthe course of this negotiation between Mr. Van Rensselaer and the\r\ncommissary-general of the State of New York this individual, Mr. Van\r\nRensselaer, has not hesitated to place himself within the immediate\r\njurisdiction of the government whose laws he had violated and in direct\r\npersonal communication with the officer of that government, and has,\r\nnevertheless, been allowed to return unmolested to continue in command\r\nof American citizens engaged in open hostilities against Great Britain.\r\n\r\nThe exact position, then, of affairs on our frontier may be thus described:\r\n\r\nAn army of American citizens, joined to a very few traitors from Upper\r\nCanada, and under the command of a subject of the United States, has\r\nbeen raised and equipped in the State of New York against the laws\r\nof the United States and the treaties now subsisting, and are using\r\nartillery plundered from the arsenals of the State of New York in\r\ncarrying on this piratical warfare against a friendly country.\r\n\r\nThe officers and Government of the United States and of the State of New\r\nYork have attempted to arrest these proceedings and to control their\r\ncitizens, but they have failed. Although this piratical assemblage are\r\nthus defying the civil authorities of both countries, Upper Canada alone\r\nis the object of their hostilities. The Government of the United States\r\nhas failed to enforce its authority by any means, civil or military, and\r\nthe single question (if it be a question) is whether Upper Canada was\r\nbound to refrain from necessary acts of self-defense against a people\r\nwhom their own Government either could not or would not control.\r\n\r\nIn perusing the message of His Excellency Governor Marcy to the\r\nlegislature of the State of New York your excellency will probably feel\r\nsome degree of surprise that after three weeks' continued hostility\r\ncarried on by the citizens of New York against the people of Upper\r\nCanada his excellency seems to have considered himself not called upon\r\nto make this aggression the subject of remark for any other purpose\r\nthan to complain of a solitary act of self-defense on the part of Her\r\nMajesty's Province of Upper Canada, to which such unprovoked hostilities\r\nhave unavoidably led.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, sir, your excellency's most obedient, humble\r\nservant.\r\n\r\nF.B. HEAD.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: Omitted.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Forsyth to Mr. Fox_.\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE,\r\n\r\n_Washington, February 13, 1838_.\r\n\r\nHENRY S. FOX, Esq., etc.\r\n\r\nSIR: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your note of the\r\n6th instant, communicating a copy of a letter from Sir Francis Head,\r\nlieutenant-governor of the Province of Upper Canada, respecting the\r\ncapture and destruction of the steamboat _Caroline_ by a Canadian force\r\non the American side of the Niagara River within the jurisdiction of the\r\nState of New York, together with the reports and depositions thereto\r\nannexed.\r\n\r\nThe statement of the facts which these papers present is at variance\r\nwith the information communicated to this Government respecting that\r\ntransaction; but it is not intended to enter at present upon an\r\nexamination of the details of the case, as steps have been taken to\r\nobtain the fullest evidence that can be had of the particulars of the\r\noutrage, upon the receipt of which it will be made the subject of a\r\nformal complaint to the British Government for redress. Even admitting\r\nthat the documents transmitted with your note contain a correct\r\nstatement of the occurrence, they furnish no justification of the\r\naggression committed upon the territory of the United States--an\r\naggression which was the more unexpected as Sir Francis Head, in his\r\nspeech at the opening of the parliament of Upper Canada, had expressed\r\nhis confidence in the disposition of this Government to restrain its\r\ncitizens from taking part in the conflict which was waging in that\r\nProvince, and added that, having communicated with the governor of\r\nthe State of New York and yourself, he was then waiting for replies.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to remind you that his expectations have been met by\r\nthe adoption of measures on the part of the United States as prompt and\r\nvigorous as they have been successful in repressing every attempt of\r\nthe inhabitants of the frontier States to interfere unlawfully in that\r\ncontest. The most serious obstacle thrown in the way of those measures\r\nwas the burning of the _Caroline_, which, while it was of no service\r\nto Her Britannic Majesty's cause in Canada, had the natural effect of\r\nincreasing the excitement on the border, which this Government was\r\nendeavoring to allay.\r\n\r\nI avail myself of this occasion to renew to you the assurance of my\r\ndistinguished consideration.\r\n\r\nJOHN FORSYTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBUFFALO, _December 30, 1837_.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency MARTIN VAN BUREN,\r\n\r\n_President of the United States_.\r\n\r\nSIR: Inclosed are copies of affidavits[28] which I have prepared in\r\ngreat haste, and which contain all that is material in relation to the\r\ngross and extraordinary transaction to which they relate. Our whole\r\nfrontier is in commotion, and I fear it will be difficult to restrain\r\nour citizens from avenging by a resort to arms this flagrant invasion\r\nof our territory. Everything that can be done will be by the public\r\nauthorities to prevent so injudicious a movement. The respective\r\nsheriffs of Erie and Niagara have taken the responsibility of calling\r\nout the militia to guard the frontier and prevent any further\r\ndepredations.\r\n\r\nI am, sir, with great consideration, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nH.W. ROGERS,\r\n\r\n_District Attorney for Erie County, and Acting for the United States_.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28: Omitted.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _April, 1838_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI transmit a communication from the Department of War, on the subject of\r\nthe treaty with the Stockbridge and Munsee Indians of September, 1836,\r\nwhich is now before the Senate.\r\n\r\nM.

VAN BUREN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 10, 1838_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI submit to the consideration of Congress a statement prepared by the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury, by which it appears that the United States,\r\nwith over twenty-eight millions in deposit with the States and over\r\nfifteen millions due from individuals and banks, are, from the situation\r\nin which those funds are placed, in immediate danger of being rendered\r\nunable to discharge with good faith and promptitude the various\r\npecuniary obligations of the Government. The occurrence of this result\r\nhas for some time been apprehended, and efforts made to avert it. As the\r\nprincipal difficulty arises from a prohibition in the present law to\r\nreissue such Treasury notes as might be paid in before they fell due,\r\nand may be effectually obviated by giving the Treasury during the whole\r\nyear the benefit of the full amount originally authorized, the remedy\r\nwould seem to be obvious and easy.\r\n\r\nThe serious embarrassments likely to arise from a longer continuance\r\nof the present state of things induces me respectfully to invite the\r\nearliest attention of Congress to the subject which may be consistent\r\nwith a due regard to other public interests.\r\n\r\nM. VAN BUREN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 11, 1838_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit to the House of Representatives reports from the\r\nSecretary of State and the Secretary of the Treasury, with accompanying\r\npapers, in answer to the resolution of the House of the 30th ultimo,\r\nrelating to the introduction of foreign paupers into the United States.\r\n\r\nM.

Greely, John\r\nBaker, and others in compensation for losses and sufferings experienced\r\nby them respectively under circumstances more fully explained in his\r\nexcellency's letter.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of any authority on the part of the Executive to satisfy\r\nthese claims, they are now submitted to Congress for consideration; and\r\nI deem it proper at the same time, with reference to the observations\r\ncontained in Governor Kent's note above mentioned, to communicate to\r\nthe Senate copies of other papers connected with the subject of the\r\nnortheastern boundary of the United States, which, with the documents\r\nalready made public, will show the actual state of the negotiations with\r\nGreat Britain on the general question.\r\n\r\nM. VAN BUREN.\r\n\r\n[The same message was sent to the House of Representatives.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATE OF MAINE, EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT,\r\n\r\n_Augusta, April 28, 1838_.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency MARTIN VAN BUREN,\r\n\r\n_President of the United States_.\r\n\r\nSIR: I have the honor to inclose to you a copy of a resolve[32] of the\r\nlegislature of this State in favor of Ebenezer S. Greely, also a copy of\r\na resolve[32] in favor of John Baker and others; and in compliance with\r\nthe request of the legislature I ask of the Government of the United\r\nStates a reimbursement of the several sums allowed thereby, which\r\nseveral sums have been paid by this State to the individuals named in\r\nthe resolves.\r\n\r\nThe justice and propriety of granting this request, I can have no doubt,\r\nwill be apparent to you and to Congress when the circumstances under\r\nwhich the allowances were made are called to mind.\r\n\r\nMr. Greely, acting as agent under a law of this State authorizing and\r\ndirecting a census to be taken in unincorporated places, was forcibly\r\nseized and imprisoned for several months, and then, without trial,\r\nreleased.\r\n\r\nJohn Baker and his associates named in the other resolve suffered\r\nby imprisonment and otherwise for acting under a law of this State\r\nincorporating the town of Madawaska in 1831. The State of Maine has\r\nacknowledged by these and other resolves its sense of obligation to\r\nremunerate in the first instance these sufferers in its cause and to\r\nsatisfy as far as it is able their claims upon its justice. But the\r\nwrongs by which they suffered were committed by a foreign power with\r\nwhom we are now at peace. The State of Maine has no power to make war\r\nor authorize reprisals. She can only look to the General Government\r\nto assume the payment as an act of justice to a member of the Union\r\nunder the provisions of the Constitution and to demand redress and\r\nremuneration from the authors of the wrong in the name of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nA minute recapitulation of the facts upon which these resolves are\r\nfounded is deemed entirely unnecessary and superfluous, as they have\r\nheretofore been communicated and are well known to the Executive and\r\nto Congress.\r\n\r\nMaine has suffered too many repetitions of similar attempts to prevent\r\nher from enjoying her rightful possessions and enforcing her just claims\r\nto feel indifferent on the subject, and we look with confidence to the\r\nGeneral Government for protection and support. The amount of money,\r\nalthough considerable, is of comparatively small importance when\r\ncontrasted with the principles involved and the effect which must result\r\nfrom an immediate and ready assumption of the liability on the part of\r\nthe United States. Such an act would be highly gratifying to the people\r\nof this State as evidence that their just claims and rights are fully\r\nrecognized by the United States, and that the strong arm of the Union\r\nwill be stretched out for their protection in every lawful effort to\r\nmaintain and enforce their claims, which they know and feel to be just\r\nand unimpeachable and which they are determined to maintain.\r\n\r\nI trust I shall be pardoned for earnestly urging immediate action on the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nI had the honor to inclose to you, under date of the 28th of March last,\r\na copy of my message to the legislature and of the resolves of the\r\nlegislature of Maine in relation to the northeastern boundary, which\r\nI have no doubt have received and will receive all the attention the\r\nimportance of the subjects therein discussed and acted on demands. You\r\nwill perceive that in accordance with your wishes I communicated the\r\nproposition in relation to a conventional line of boundary, with the\r\nletter of Mr. Forsyth addressed to the executive of Maine. The views and\r\nwishes and determination of the executive and legislature, and I think\r\nI may safely add of the people, of Maine are fully and distinctly set\r\nforth in the documents referred to, communicated to you heretofore by\r\nme. The proposition was distinct and definite, and the answer is equally\r\nso, and I consider that it may be regarded as the fixed determination of\r\nMaine to consent to no proposition on our part to vary the treaty line,\r\nbut to stand by that line as a definite, a practicable, and a fair one\r\nuntil its impracticability is demonstrated. It is needless for me to\r\nrecapitulate the reasons upon which this determination is founded.\r\nI refer you to the documents before alluded to for my own views on this\r\ntopic, sanctioned fully by the legislature. The duty devolving upon me\r\nby your request I have endeavored to discharge in a spirit of profound\r\nrespect for the constituted officers of the General Government, and with\r\na single eye to the interest and honor of the United States and of\r\nthe State of Maine. The attitude assumed by Maine in relation to the\r\nsurvey of the line of the treaty of 1783 has doubtless attracted your\r\nattention. I feel it due to the State to say to you frankly and\r\nunequivocally that this position was taken deliberately and with a full\r\nconsideration of all the circumstances of the case; but it was assumed\r\nin no spirit of defiance or resistance and with no design to embarrass\r\nthe action of the General Government. Maine feels no desire to act alone\r\nor independently on this question. She knows and feels that it is a\r\nnational question, and that it is the right and duty of the General\r\nGovernment to move forward in effecting the object proposed.\r\n\r\nI feel fully warranted in saying that Maine does not intend by this\r\nexpression of her determination to run the line in a certain contingency\r\nto waive in the least degree her well-founded claim upon the General\r\nGovernment to run, mark, and establish it. On the contrary, she will\r\nmost reluctantly yield the hope she now so strongly feels that it is\r\nthe intention of that Government to relieve her from the necessity of\r\nthrowing herself upon her own resources to assert and defend her most\r\nunquestionable right. The wish of this State is that the first act\r\nshould be to run the line of the treaty of 1783 to ascertain the facts\r\nin relation to the topography of the country and the exact spot where\r\nthe northwest angle of Nova Scotia may be found according to our\r\nconstruction of the treaty language, and to place suitable monuments\r\nalong the whole line. Such a survey would not settle or determine any\r\nrights, but it would express and declare our views and intentions. Such\r\na survey is not a warlike or offensive movement, and can not justly give\r\noffense to the other party in the controversy. It is the unquestionable\r\nright of litigants in a court of justice to make explorations of land\r\nin dispute, and if either party declines a joint survey it may be made\r\n_ex parte_ and surely the United States have never so far yielded the\r\nactual possession to Great Britain as to preclude the right on our part\r\nto ascertain for ourselves the absolute facts and to mark out the limits\r\nof our claim and our alleged right. This act Maine asks, and asks\r\nearnestly, the General Government to perform without delay. Such an\r\nassumption of the controversy on the part of the United States would be\r\nto Maine an assurance that her rights were duly regarded, and would\r\nbe steadily and perseveringly maintained. We want the name and the\r\nauthority of the United States, and there can be no doubt that an act\r\nemanating from that source would be regarded by those interested on both\r\nsides as of more importance than any act of an individual State. So far,\r\nthen, from any indifference on the part of Maine as to the action of the\r\nGeneral Government, or any desire to be driven to assume the performance\r\nof the duty alluded to, she looks with intense anxiety and confident\r\nhope to be relieved from this position. She believes it is alike due to\r\nthe honor of the United States and the rights of Maine that the General\r\nGovernment should go forward in the work, and that there is less to\r\napprehend in the result from such a course than any other. But Maine\r\nfeels that the time for decisive action has come, that she can not be\r\nsatisfied to have the claim to absolute and exclusive jurisdiction of\r\na large part of her territory longer tolerated and acquiesced in. She\r\nknows that it rightfully belongs to her jurisdiction, that it is hers by\r\na clear, perfect, and honest title--as clear, as perfect, and rightful\r\nas her title to any portion of the State--and she can not consent\r\nto have this title impaired or weakened by bold encroachments and\r\nunscrupulous demands. She can not consent that a title transmitted\r\nby the fathers of the Revolution shall be destroyed or defeated by\r\nacquiescence in the adverse occupation of a foreign state, and that what\r\nwas once fairly yielded shall be reclaimed in utter defiance of a solemn\r\ndeed of cession. I am confident I am not mistaken in stating that the\r\nlegislature of Maine considered the question as fairly and plainly\r\nbefore the National Government, and that if the present session of\r\nCongress should close with a denial or postponement of the proposed\r\nsurvey and no commission should be created by the Executive, as\r\ncontemplated in the resolution referred to, we should have a right\r\nand be bound to regard such a delay or refusal as evidence of an\r\nindisposition on the part of the General Government to accede to our\r\nexpressed views and wishes, and a denial of justice, and that Maine in\r\nthat event owed it to herself to cause the survey to be made under her\r\nown authority. The duty of the executive of Maine is plainly pointed out\r\nand made imperative and absolute by the resolves of the legislature, and\r\nI certainly can not hesitate, so far as I have the means and power, to\r\nexecute their declared will.\r\n\r\nThe people of Maine, sir, are not desirous of conflict or war. Both\r\nin their habits and their principles they love and wish for peace and\r\nquiet within their borders. They are not ambitious to win laurels or to\r\nacquire military glory by waging war with their neighbors, and least\r\nof all are they desirous of a _border_ warfare, which may be the means\r\nof sacrificing human life and engendering ill will and bad passions,\r\nwithout bringing the controversy to a conclusion. They are scattered\r\nover our thousand hills, engaged in their quiet and peaceful labors,\r\nand it is the first wish of their hearts to live peaceably with all men\r\nand all nations. They have no anxiety to extend our limits or to gain\r\nterritory by conquest, but there is a firm and determined spirit in this\r\npeople which can not brook insult and will not submit to intentional\r\ninjury. \"They know their rights, and knowing dare maintain them\" with\r\ncalm determination and deliberate purpose, and they appeal with\r\nunshrinking confidence to their sister States and to the Government\r\nwhich binds them together for effective support in this their purpose.\r\n\r\nThe crisis, as we believe, demands firm and decided language and the\r\nexpression of a determined design. Maine has never refused to acquiesce\r\nin any fair and honorable mode of fixing the line _according to the\r\ntreaty of 1783_. I have no doubt (but upon this point I speak according\r\nto my individual belief) that the mode proposed by Great Britain of\r\nestablishing the treaty line upon the face of the earth by a commission\r\ncomposed of impartial and scientific men, to be elected by a friendly\r\npower, would be satisfactory and acquiesced in by this State, but that\r\nwe should neither ask nor agree that any preliminary points should be\r\nyielded by either party. We should only ask that the treaty should be\r\nplaced in their hands with directions to ascertain and run and fix the\r\nline according to its plain language and obvious meaning.\r\n\r\nMaine can never consent, as I apprehend, to yield the main points of the\r\ncase and then refer it to enable the judges to divide the subject-matter\r\nof the controversy.\r\n\r\nWe feel that we now stand on the high vantage ground of truth and\r\njustice, and that it can not be that any nation professing to act on the\r\nprinciples of right and equity can stand up before the civilized world\r\nand contest with unyielding pertinacity our claim. We have too much\r\nrespect for the nation from which we descended to believe that she will\r\nsully her reputation by such persevering resistance.\r\n\r\nI am conscious that the language and style of this communication are\r\nunusual and probably undiplomatic; that there is more of the fervor of\r\nfeeling and the plain language of direct appeal than is usual in such\r\npapers; but it is a subject of such vast importance to the State whose\r\ninterests have been in part intrusted to me and whose organ I am that I\r\ncan not speak in measured terms or indefinite language. On this subject\r\nwe have no ulterior views and no concealed objects. Our plans and our\r\npolicy are open and exposed to the view of all men. Maine has nothing\r\nin either to conceal or disguise. She plainly and distinctly asks for\r\nspecific and definite action. In performing what I conceive to be\r\nmy duty I have been actuated by entire respect toward the General\r\nGovernment and by the single desire to explain and enforce as well as\r\nI was able our wishes and our rights. I can only add that we trust the\r\nGeneral Government will assume the performance of the act specified in\r\nthe resolution and relieve Maine from the necessity of independent\r\naction.\r\n\r\nWith great respect, I have the honor to be, your most obedient servant,\r\n\r\nEDWARD KENT.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 32: Omitted.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE,\r\n\r\n_Washington, April 27, 1838_.\r\n\r\nHENRY S. FOX, Esq., etc.:\r\n\r\nThe undersigned, Secretary of State of the United States, has the honor,\r\nby the directions of the President, to communicate to Mr. Fox, Her\r\nBritannic Majesty's envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary,\r\nthe result of the application of the General Government to the State\r\nof Maine on the subject of the northeastern boundary line and the\r\nresolution which the President has formed upon a careful consideration\r\nthereof. By the accompanying papers,[33] received from the executive\r\nof Maine, Mr. Fox will perceive that Maine declines to give a consent\r\nto the negotiation for a conventional boundary, is disinclined to the\r\nreference of the points in dispute to a new arbitration, but is yet\r\nfirmly persuaded that the line described in the treaty of 1783 can be\r\nfound and traced whenever the Governments of the United States and\r\nGreat Britain shall proceed to make the requisite investigations with\r\na predisposition to effect that very desirable object. Confidently\r\nrelying, as the President does, upon the assurances frequently repeated\r\nby the British Government of the earnest desire to reach that result if\r\nit is practicable, he has instructed the undersigned to announce to Mr.\r\nFox the willingness of this Government to enter into an arrangement with\r\nGreat Britain for the establishment of a joint commission of survey and\r\nexploration upon the basis of the original American proposition and the\r\nmodifications offered by Her Majesty's Government.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of State is therefore authorized to invite Mr. Fox to\r\na conference upon the subject at as early a day as his convenience\r\nwill permit, and the undersigned will be immediately furnished with a\r\nrequisite full power by the President to conclude a convention embracing\r\nthat object if Her Majesty's minister is duly empowered to proceed to\r\nthe negotiation of it on the part of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned avails himself of this occasion to renew to Mr. Fox the\r\nexpression of his distinguished consideration.\r\n\r\nJOHN FORSYTH.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33: Omitted.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 1, 1838_.\r\n\r\nHon. JOHN FORSYTH, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nSir: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your official note\r\nof the 27th ultimo, in which you inclose to me a communication received\r\nby the Federal Government from the executive of Maine upon the subject\r\nof the northeastern boundary line, and in which you inform me that the\r\nPresident is willing to enter into an arrangement with Her Majesty's\r\nGovernment for the establishment of a joint commission of survey and\r\nexploration upon the basis of the original American proposition and of\r\nthe modifications offered by Her Majesty's Government, as communicated\r\nto you in my note of the 10th of January last, and you invite me to a\r\nconference for the purpose of negotiating a convention that shall\r\nembrace the above object if I am duly empowered by my Government to\r\nproceed to such negotiation.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to state to you in reply that my actual instructions\r\nwere fulfilled by the delivery of the communication which I addressed to\r\nyou on the 10th of January, and that I am not at present provided with\r\nfull powers for negotiating the proposed convention. I will forthwith,\r\nhowever, transmit to Her Majesty's Government the note which I have had\r\nthe honor to receive from you in order that such fresh instructions may\r\nbe furnished to me or such other steps taken as the present situation of\r\nthe question may appear to Her Majesty's Government to require.\r\n\r\nI avail myself of this occasion to renew to you the assurance of my high\r\nrespect and consideration.\r\n\r\nH.S. FOX.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE,\r\n\r\n_Washington, May 8, 1838_.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency EDWARD KENT,\r\n\r\n_Governor of Maine_.\r\n\r\nSir: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt on the 22d ultimo of\r\nthe communication addressed to this Department by your excellency on\r\nthe 28th of March last, transmitting a printed copy of your message of\r\nthe 14th of the same month to the legislature of Maine, together with\r\ncertain resolves passed by that body, in relation to the northeastern\r\nboundary of the State.\r\n\r\nAlthough the answer thus given to the application made to you, by\r\ndirection of the President, under date of the 1st of March last, to\r\nascertain the sense of the State of Maine in regard to a conventional\r\nline of boundary may be regarded as conclusive, I still deem it proper,\r\nwith reference to your excellency's message, to mark a misconception\r\nwhich appears to have existed on your part when communicating to the\r\nlegislature the letter and documents received from this Department. This\r\nis done with the greater freedom since the frank and liberal manner in\r\nwhich your excellency invited the attention of that body to the subject\r\nis highly appreciated by the President. The question therein presented\r\nfor consideration was not, as your excellency supposed, whether the\r\nState of Maine should \"take the lead in abandoning the treaty and\r\nvolunteer propositions for a conventional line,\" but simply whether the\r\ngovernment of Maine would consent that the General Government should\r\nentertain a direct negotiation with the British Government for a\r\nconventional line of boundary on the northeastern frontier of the United\r\nStates. Had that consent been given it would have been reasonable to\r\nexpect the proposition of a line from Great Britain, as it was that\r\npower which particularly desired the resort to that mode of settling the\r\ncontroversy. It was also the intention of the President so to arrange\r\nthe negotiation that the approbation of Maine to the boundary line\r\nagreed upon should have been secured. It was with this view that in the\r\napplication to the State of Maine for its assent to a negotiation for a\r\nconventional line express reference was made to such conditions as she\r\nmight think proper to prescribe. To all such as were, in the opinion of\r\nthe President, required by a proper regard for the security of Maine and\r\nconsistent with the Constitution he would have yielded a ready assent.\r\nOf that character was he disposed to regard a condition that in a\r\nnegotiation for the final establishment of a new line, with power on the\r\npart of the negotiators to stipulate for the cession or exchange of\r\nterritory as the interests and convenience of the parties might be found\r\nto require, the State of Maine should be represented by commissioners of\r\nher own selection and that their previous assent should be requisite to\r\nmake any treaty containing such stipulation binding upon her.\r\n\r\nThese suggestions are not now made as matter of complaint at the\r\ndecision which the State of Maine has come to on a matter in which she\r\nwas at perfect liberty to pursue the course she has adopted, but in\r\njustice to the views of the President in making the application.\r\n\r\nI am instructed to announce to your excellency that by direction of the\r\nPresident, upon due consideration of the result of the late application\r\nof the General Government to the State of Maine on the subject of the\r\nnortheastern boundary and in accordance with the expressed wishes of\r\nher legislature, I have informed Mr. Fox of the willingness of this\r\nGovernment to enter into an arrangement with that of Great Britain for\r\nthe establishment of a joint commission of survey and exploration upon\r\nthe basis of the original American proposition and the modifications\r\noffered by Her Majesty's Government, and to apprise you that Mr. Fox,\r\nbeing at present unprovided with full powers for negotiating the\r\nproposed convention, has transmitted my communication to his Government\r\nin order that such fresh instructions may be furnished to him or such\r\nother steps taken as may be deemed expedient on its part.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great respect, your excellency's obedient\r\nservant,\r\n\r\nJOHN FORSYTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 21, 1838_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nThe accompanying copy of a communication addressed by the Secretary of\r\nWar to the Cherokee delegation is submitted to Congress in order that\r\nsuch measures may be adopted as are required to carry into effect the\r\nbenevolent intentions of the Government toward the Cherokee Nation, and\r\nwhich it is hoped will induce them to remove peaceably and contentedly\r\nto their new homes in the West.\r\n\r\nM.

I also transmit\r\ncertain documents which were exhibited in support of the said account.\r\nI recommend to the consideration of Congress the expediency of an\r\nappropriation for the payment of this claim and of some general\r\nprovision for the liquidation and payment of others which may be\r\nexpected to be presented hereafter for services of a similar character\r\nrendered before and after the passage of the act of the 20th March last,\r\nfor preserving the neutrality of the United States on the northern\r\nfrontier, which act imposes important duties upon the marshals and other\r\ncivil officers, but omits to provide for their remuneration or for the\r\nreimbursement of their expenses.\r\n\r\nM. VAN BUREN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _June 7, 1838_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nHaving received satisfactory assurances from the Government of Ecuador\r\nof its desire to negotiate a treaty of commerce on the most liberal\r\nprinciples in place of the expired treaty made with the Republic of\r\nColombia, heretofore regulating our intercourse with Ecuador, it is my\r\ndesign to give the requisite authority for that purpose to the chargé\r\nd'affaires of the United States about to be appointed for Peru, with\r\ninstructions to stop in Ecuador on his way to Lima as the agent of the\r\nUnited States to accomplish that object. The only additional charges to\r\nbe incurred will be the expense of his journey from Panama to Quito, and\r\nfrom thence to the place of embarkation for Lima, to be paid out of the\r\nforeign-intercourse fund. I make this communication to the Senate that\r\nan opportunity may be afforded for the expression of an opinion, if\r\nit shall be deemed necessary, on the exercise of such a power by the\r\nExecutive without applying to the Senate for its approbation and\r\nconsent. In debate it has been sometimes asserted that this power,\r\nfrequently exercised without question or complaint, and leading to\r\nno practical evil, as no arrangement made under such circumstances\r\ncan be obligatory upon the United States without being submitted to\r\nthe approbation of the Senate, is an encroachment upon its rightful\r\nauthority. It appears to have been considered that the annual\r\nappropriation of a gross sum for the expenses of foreign intercourse is\r\nintended, among other objects, to provide for the cost of such agencies,\r\nand that the authority granted is the same as that frequently given to\r\nthe Secretary of State to form treaties with the representatives or\r\nagents of foreign governments, upon the granting of which the Senate\r\nnever have been consulted.\r\n\r\nDesiring in this and in all other instances to act with the most\r\ncautious respect to the claims of other branches of the Government,\r\nI bring this subject to the notice of the Senate that if it shall be\r\ndeemed proper to raise any question it may be discussed and decided\r\nbefore and not after the power shall have been exercised.\r\n\r\nM. VAN BUREN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON CITY, _June 11, 1838_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI submit herewith, for consideration and action, a communication from\r\nthe Secretary of War and the treaty with the Otoe, Missouria, and Omaha\r\nIndians therein referred to.\r\n\r\nM. VAN BUREN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _June 20, 1838_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit, in compliance with a resolution of the House of\r\nRepresentatives of the 11th instant, reports from the Secretaries\r\nof State, Treasury, and War, with the documents referred to by them\r\nrespectively. It will be seen that the outrage committed on the\r\nsteamboat _Sir Robert Peel_, under the British flag, within the waters\r\nof the United States, and on the steamboat _Telegraph_, under the\r\nAmerican flag, at Brockville, in Upper Canada, have not been followed\r\nby any demand by either Government on the other for redress. These acts\r\nhave been so far treated on each side as criminal offenses committed\r\nwithin the jurisdiction of tribunals competent to inquire into the facts\r\nand to punish the persons concerned in them. Investigations have been\r\nmade, some of the individuals inculpated have been arrested, and\r\nprosecutions are in progress, the result of which can not be doubted.\r\nThe excited state of public feeling on the borders of Canada on both\r\nsides of the line has occasioned the most painful anxiety to this\r\nGovernment. Every effort has been and will be made to prevent the\r\nsuccess of the design, apparently formed and in the course of execution\r\nby Canadians who have found a refuge within the territory, aided by a\r\nfew reckless persons of our own country, to involve the nation in a war\r\nwith a neighboring and friendly power. Such design can not succeed while\r\nthe two Governments appreciate and confidently rely upon the good faith\r\nof each other in the performance of their respective duties. With a\r\nfixed determination to use all the means in my power to put a speedy\r\nand satisfactory termination to these border troubles, I have the most\r\nconfident assurances of the cordial cooperation of the British\r\nauthorities, at home and in the North American possessions, in the\r\naccomplishment of a purpose so sincerely and earnestly desired by the\r\nGovernments and people both of the United States and Great Britain.\r\n\r\nM. VAN BUREN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _June 28, 1838_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution passed by the House of Representatives\r\non the 23d instant, in respect to the new Treasury building, I submit\r\nthe inclosed report from the commissioners charged with a general\r\nsuperintendence of the work, and which, with the documents annexed,\r\nis believed to contain all the information desired.\r\n\r\nM. VAN BUREN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _June 28, 1838_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI nominate Lieutenant-Colonel Thayer, of the Corps of Engineers, for the\r\nbrevet of colonel in the Army, agreeably to the recommendation of the\r\nSecretary of War.\r\n\r\nM. VAN BUREN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, _June 28, 1838_.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nSIR: In submitting the name of Brevet Lieutenant-Colonel S. Thayer,\r\nof the Corps of Engineers, for the brevet of colonel for ten years'\r\nfaithful service in one grade it may be proper to state the\r\ncircumstances of his case.\r\n\r\nWhen the law of 1812 regulating brevets was repealed by the act of June\r\n30, 1834, all the officers of the Army who were known to be entitled to\r\nthe ordinary brevet promotion for ten years' faithful service in one\r\ngrade received on that day, by and with the advice and consent of the\r\nSenate, the brevet promotion to which they were respectively entitled.\r\nThe regulation which governed the subject under the law had reference\r\nonly to service with regularly organized bodies of troops, and valid\r\nclaims arising under it were generally known and easily understood at\r\nthe Adjutant-General's Office. If incidental cases occurred for which\r\nthe written regulations could not provide the rule, although equally\r\nvalid, such, nevertheless, may not in every instance have been known at\r\nthe War Department until specially represented by the party interested.\r\nThe case of Brevet Lieutenant-Colonel Thayer happened to be one of those\r\nincidental claims, and as soon as it was submitted for consideration its\r\nvalidity was clearly seen and acknowledged. Had it been submitted to\r\nthe Department when the list was made out in June, 1834, it may not be\r\ndoubted that this highly meritorious and deserving officer would at the\r\ntime have received the brevet of colonel for \"having served faithfully\r\nas brevet lieutenant-colonel and performed the appropriate duties of\r\nthat grade for ten years,\" which, it may be seen, was due more than\r\n_a year before the passage of the act repealing the law_.\r\n\r\nIn presenting now this deferred case for your favorable consideration\r\njustice requires that I should advert to the valuable services\r\nrendered to the Army and the country by Lieutenant-Colonel Thayer as\r\nSuperintendent of the Military Academy at West Point. In 1817 he found\r\nthat institution defective in all its branches, and without order; in\r\n1833 he left it established upon a basis alike honorable to himself and\r\nuseful to the nation. These meritorious services constitute _another_\r\nclaim which entitles this officer to the notice of the Government, and\r\nas they come fairly within one of the conditions of the law which yet\r\nopen the way to brevet promotion, the incentive it provides is fully\r\nrealized by the services that have been rendered.\r\n\r\nI am, sir, with great respect, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nJ.R. POINSETT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _July 2, 1838_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit to the House of Representatives a report[36] from\r\nthe Secretary of State, together with the documents therein referred to\r\nin answer to their resolution of the 28th of May last.\r\n\r\nM.

VAN BUREN.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  JOHN FORSYTH,\r\n    _Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND ANNUAL MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 3, 1838_.\r\n\r\n_Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI congratulate you on the favorable circumstances in the condition\r\nof our country under which you reassemble for the performance of your\r\nofficial duties. Though the anticipations of an abundant harvest have\r\nnot everywhere been realized, yet on the whole the labors of the\r\nhusbandman are rewarded with a bountiful return; industry prospers in\r\nits various channels of business and enterprise; general health again\r\nprevails through our vast diversity of climate; nothing threatens from\r\nabroad the continuance of external peace; nor has anything at home\r\nimpaired the strength of those fraternal and domestic ties which\r\nconstitute the only guaranty to the success and permanency of our happy\r\nUnion, and which, formed in the hour of peril, have hitherto been\r\nhonorably sustained through every vicissitude in our national affairs.\r\nThese blessings, which evince the care and beneficence of Providence,\r\ncall for our devout and fervent gratitude.\r\n\r\nWe have not less reason to be grateful for other bounties bestowed by\r\nthe same munificent hand, and more exclusively our own.\r\n\r\nThe present year closes the first half century of our Federal\r\ninstitutions, and our system, differing from all others in the\r\nacknowledged practical and unlimited operation which it has for so long\r\na period given to the sovereignty of the people, has now been fully\r\ntested by experience.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution devised by our forefathers as the framework and bond\r\nof that system, then untried, has become a settled form of government;\r\nnot only preserving and protecting the great principles upon which it\r\nwas founded, but wonderfully promoting individual happiness and private\r\ninterests. Though subject to change and entire revocation whenever\r\ndeemed inadequate to all these purposes, yet such is the wisdom of its\r\nconstruction and so stable has been the public sentiment that it remains\r\nunaltered except in matters of detail comparatively unimportant. It has\r\nproved amply sufficient for the various emergencies incident to our\r\ncondition as a nation. A formidable foreign war; agitating collisions\r\nbetween domestic, and in some respects rival, sovereignties; temptations\r\nto interfere in the intestine commotions of neighboring countries; the\r\ndangerous influences that arise in periods of excessive prosperity, and\r\nthe antirepublican tendencies of associated wealth--these, with other\r\ntrials not less formidable, have all been encountered, and thus far\r\nsuccessfully resisted.\r\n\r\nIt was reserved for the American Union to test the advantages of a\r\ngovernment entirely dependent on the continual exercise of the popular\r\nwill, and our experience has shown that it is as beneficent in practice\r\nas it is just in theory. Each successive change made in our local\r\ninstitutions has contributed to extend the right of suffrage, has\r\nincreased the direct influence of the mass of the community, given\r\ngreater freedom to individual exertion, and restricted more and more the\r\npowers of Government; yet the intelligence, prudence, and patriotism\r\nof the people have kept pace with this augmented responsibility. In\r\nno country has education been so widely diffused. Domestic peace has\r\nnowhere so largely reigned. The close bonds of social intercourse have\r\nin no instance prevailed with such harmony over a space so vast. All\r\nforms of religion have united for the first time to diffuse charity and\r\npiety, because for the first time in the history of nations all have\r\nbeen totally untrammeled and absolutely free. The deepest recesses of\r\nthe wilderness have been penetrated; yet instead of the rudeness in the\r\nsocial condition consequent upon such adventures elsewhere, numerous\r\ncommunities have sprung up, already unrivaled in prosperity, general\r\nintelligence, internal tranquillity, and the wisdom of their political\r\ninstitutions. Internal improvement, the fruit of individual enterprise,\r\nfostered by the protection of the States, has added new links to\r\nthe Confederation and fresh rewards to provident industry. Doubtful\r\nquestions of domestic policy have been quietly settled by mutual\r\nforbearance, and agriculture, commerce, and manufactures minister to\r\neach other. Taxation and public debt, the burdens which bear so heavily\r\nupon all other countries, have pressed with comparative lightness upon\r\nus. Without one entangling alliance, our friendship is prized by every\r\nnation, and the rights of our citizens are everywhere respected,\r\nbecause they are known to be guarded by a united, sensitive, and\r\nwatchful people.\r\n\r\nTo this practical operation of our institutions, so evident and\r\nsuccessful, we owe that increased attachment to them which is among the\r\nmost cheering exhibitions of popular sentiment and will prove their best\r\nsecurity in time to come against foreign or domestic assault.\r\n\r\nThis review of the results of our institutions for half a century,\r\nwithout exciting a spirit of vain exultation, should serve to impress\r\nupon us the great principles from which they have sprung--constant and\r\ndirect supervision by the people over every public measure, strict\r\nforbearance on the part of the Government from exercising any doubtful\r\nor disputed powers, and a cautious abstinence from all interference with\r\nconcerns which properly belong and are best left to State regulations\r\nand individual enterprise.\r\n\r\nFull information of the state of our foreign affairs having been\r\nrecently on different occasions submitted to Congress, I deem it\r\nnecessary now to bring to your notice only such events as have\r\nsubsequently occurred or are of such importance as to require particular\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nThe most amicable dispositions continue to be exhibited by all the\r\nnations with whom the Government and citizens of the United States have\r\nan habitual intercourse. At the date of my last annual message Mexico\r\nwas the only nation which could not be included in so gratifying a\r\nreference to our foreign relations.\r\n\r\nI am happy to be now able to inform you that an advance has been made\r\ntoward the adjustment of our differences with that Republic and the\r\nrestoration of the customary good feeling between the two nations. This\r\nimportant change has been effected by conciliatory negotiations that\r\nhave resulted in the conclusion of a treaty between the two Governments,\r\nwhich, when ratified, will refer to the arbitrament of a friendly power\r\nall the subjects of controversy between us growing out of injuries\r\nto individuals. There is at present also reason to believe that an\r\nequitable settlement of all disputed points will be attained without\r\nfurther difficulty or unnecessary delay, and thus authorize the free\r\nresumption of diplomatic intercourse with our sister Republic.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the northeastern boundary of the United States,\r\nno official correspondence between this Government and that of Great\r\nBritain has passed since that communicated to Congress toward the\r\nclose of their last session. The offer to negotiate a convention for\r\nthe appointment of a joint commission of survey and exploration I am,\r\nhowever, assured will be met by Her Majesty's Government in a\r\nconciliatory and friendly spirit, and instructions to enable the British\r\nminister here to conclude such an arrangement will be transmitted to him\r\nwithout needless delay. It is hoped and expected that these instructions\r\nwill be of a liberal character, and that this negotiation, if\r\nsuccessful, will prove to be an important step toward the satisfactory\r\nand final adjustment of the controversy.\r\n\r\nI had hoped that the respect for the laws and regard for the peace and\r\nhonor of their own country which have ever characterized the citizens of\r\nthe United States would have prevented any portion of them from using\r\nany means to promote insurrection in the territory of a power with\r\nwhich we are at peace, and with which the United States are desirous of\r\nmaintaining the most friendly relations. I regret deeply, however, to\r\nbe obliged to inform you that this has not been the case. Information\r\nhas been given to me, derived from official and other sources, that\r\nmany citizens of the United States have associated together to make\r\nhostile incursions from our territory into Canada and to aid and abet\r\ninsurrection there, in violation of the obligations and laws of the\r\nUnited States and in open disregard of their own duties as citizens.\r\nThis information has been in part confirmed by a hostile invasion\r\nactually made by citizens of the United States, in conjunction with\r\nCanadians and others, and accompanied by a forcible seizure of the\r\nproperty of our citizens and an application thereof to the prosecution\r\nof military operations against the authorities and people of Canada.\r\n\r\nThe results of these criminal assaults upon the peace and order\r\nof a neighboring country have been, as was to be expected, fatally\r\ndestructive to the misguided or deluded persons engaged in them and\r\nhighly injurious to those in whose behalf they are professed to have\r\nbeen undertaken. The authorities in Canada, from intelligence received\r\nof such intended movements among our citizens, have felt themselves\r\nobliged to take precautionary measures against them; have actually\r\nembodied the militia and assumed an attitude to repel the invasion to\r\nwhich they believed the colonies were exposed from the United States.\r\nA state of feeling on both sides of the frontier has thus been produced\r\nwhich called for prompt and vigorous interference. If an insurrection\r\nexisted in Canada, the amicable dispositions of the United States toward\r\nGreat Britain, as well as their duty to themselves, would lead them to\r\nmaintain a strict neutrality and to restrain their citizens from all\r\nviolations of the laws which have been passed for its enforcement. But\r\nthis Government recognizes a still higher obligation to repress all\r\nattempts on the part of its citizens to disturb the peace of a country\r\nwhere order prevails or has been reestablished. Depredations by our\r\ncitizens upon nations at peace with the United States, or combinations\r\nfor committing them, have at all times been regarded by the American\r\nGovernment and people with the greatest abhorrence. Military incursions\r\nby our citizens into countries so situated, and the commission of acts\r\nof violence on the members thereof, in order to effect a change in their\r\ngovernment, or under any pretext whatever, have from the commencement of\r\nour Government been held equally criminal on the part of those engaged\r\nin them, and as much deserving of punishment as would be the disturbance\r\nof the public peace by the perpetration of similar acts within our own\r\nterritory.\r\n\r\nBy no country or persons have these invaluable principles of\r\ninternational law--principles the strict observance of which is so\r\nindispensable to the preservation of social order in the world--been\r\nmore earnestly cherished or sacredly respected than by those great and\r\ngood men who first declared and finally established the independence\r\nof our own country. They promulgated and maintained them at an early\r\nand critical period in our history; they were subsequently embodied\r\nin legislative enactments of a highly penal character, the faithful\r\nenforcement of which has hitherto been, and will, I trust, always\r\ncontinue to be, regarded as a duty inseparably associated with the\r\nmaintenance of our national honor. That the people of the United States\r\nshould feel an interest in the spread of political institutions as\r\nfree as they regard their own to be is natural, nor can a sincere\r\nsolicitude for the success of all those who are at any time in good\r\nfaith struggling for their acquisition be imputed to our citizens as a\r\ncrime. With the entire freedom of opinion and an undisguised expression\r\nthereof on their part the Government has neither the right nor, I trust,\r\nthe disposition to interfere. But whether the interest or the honor of\r\nthe United States requires that they should be made a party to any such\r\nstruggle, and by inevitable consequence to the war which is waged in\r\nits support, is a question which by our Constitution is wisely left to\r\nCongress alone to decide. It is by the laws already made criminal in\r\nour citizens to embarrass or anticipate that decision by unauthorized\r\nmilitary operations on their part. Offenses of this character, in\r\naddition to their criminality as violations of the laws of our country,\r\nhave a direct tendency to draw down upon our own citizens at large the\r\nmultiplied evils of a foreign war and expose to injurious imputations\r\nthe good faith and honor of the country. As such they deserve to be\r\nput down with promptitude and decision. I can not be mistaken, I am\r\nconfident, in counting on the cordial and general concurrence of our\r\nfellow-citizens in this sentiment. A copy of the proclamation which\r\nI have felt it my duty to issue is herewith communicated. I can not but\r\nhope that the good sense and patriotism, the regard for the honor and\r\nreputation of their country, the respect for the laws which they have\r\nthemselves enacted for their own government, and the love of order\r\nfor which the mass of our people have been so long and so justly\r\ndistinguished will deter the comparatively few who are engaged in\r\nthem from a further prosecution of such desperate enterprises. In the\r\nmeantime the existing laws have been and will continue to be faithfully\r\nexecuted, and every effort will be made to carry them out in their full\r\nextent. Whether they are sufficient or not to meet the actual state of\r\nthings on the Canadian frontier it is for Congress to decide.\r\n\r\nIt will appear from the correspondence herewith submitted that the\r\nGovernment of Russia declines a renewal of the fourth article of the\r\nconvention of April, 1824, between the United States and His Imperial\r\nMajesty, by the third article of which it is agreed that \"hereafter\r\nthere shall not be formed by the citizens of the United States or under\r\nthe authority of the said States any establishment upon the northwest\r\ncoast of America, nor in any of the islands adjacent, to the north of\r\n54° 40' of north latitude, and that in the same manner there shall be\r\nnone formed by Russian subjects or under the authority of Russia south\r\nof the same parallel;\" and by the fourth article, \"that during a term of\r\nten years, counting from the signature of the present convention, the\r\nships of both powers, or which belong to their citizens or subjects,\r\nrespectively, may reciprocally frequent, without any hindrance whatever,\r\nthe interior seas, gulfs, harbors, and creeks upon the coast mentioned\r\nin the preceding article, for the purpose of fishing and trading with\r\nthe natives of the country.\" The reasons assigned for declining to renew\r\nthe provisions of this article are, briefly, that the only use made by\r\nour citizens of the privileges it secures to them has been to supply\r\nthe Indians with spirituous liquors, ammunition, and firearms; that\r\nthis traffic has been excluded from the Russian trade; and as the\r\nsupplies furnished from the United States are injurious to the Russian\r\nestablishments on the northwest coast and calculated to produce\r\ncomplaints between the two Governments, His Imperial Majesty thinks\r\nit for the interest of both countries not to accede to the proposition\r\nmade by the American Government for the renewal of the article last\r\nreferred to.\r\n\r\nThe correspondence herewith communicated will show the grounds\r\nupon which we contend that the citizens of the United States have,\r\nindependent of the provisions of the convention of 1824, a right to\r\ntrade with the natives upon the coast in question at unoccupied places,\r\nliable, however, it is admitted, to be at any time extinguished by the\r\ncreation of Russian establishments at such points. This right is denied\r\nby the Russian Government, which asserts that by the operation of the\r\ntreaty of 1824 each party agreed to waive the general right to land on\r\nthe vacant coasts on the respective sides of the degree of latitude\r\nreferred to, and accepted in lieu thereof the mutual privileges\r\nmentioned in the fourth article. The capital and tonnage employed by\r\nour citizens in their trade with the northwest coast of America will,\r\nperhaps, on adverting to the official statements of the commerce and\r\nnavigation of the United States for the last few years, be deemed too\r\ninconsiderable in amount to attract much attention; yet the subject\r\nmay in other respects deserve the careful consideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nI regret to state that the blockade of the principal ports on the\r\neastern coast of Mexico, which, in consequence of differences between\r\nthat Republic and France, was instituted in May last, unfortunately\r\nstill continues, enforced by a competent French naval armament, and is\r\nnecessarily embarrassing to our own trade in the Gulf, in common with\r\nthat of other nations. Every disposition, however, is believed to exist\r\non the part of the French Government to render this measure as little\r\nonerous as practicable to the interests of the citizens of the United\r\nStates and to those of neutral commerce, and it is to be hoped that an\r\nearly settlement of the difficulties between France and Mexico will soon\r\nreestablish the harmonious relations formerly subsisting between them\r\nand again open the ports of that Republic to the vessels of all friendly\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nA convention for marking that part of the boundary between the United\r\nStates and the Republic of Texas which extends from the mouth of the\r\nSabine to the Red River was concluded and signed at this city on the\r\n25th of April last. It has since been ratified by both Governments, and\r\nseasonable measures will be taken to carry it into effect on the part of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nThe application of that Republic for admission into this Union, made in\r\nAugust, 1837, and which was declined for reasons already made known to\r\nyou, has been formally withdrawn, as will appear from the accompanying\r\ncopy of the note of the minister plenipotentiary of Texas, which was\r\npresented to the Secretary of State on the occasion of the exchange of\r\nthe ratifications of the convention above mentioned.\r\n\r\nCopies of the convention with Texas, of a commercial treaty concluded\r\nwith the King of Greece, and of a similar treaty with the Peru-Bolivian\r\nConfederation, the ratifications of which have been recently exchanged,\r\naccompany this message, for the information of Congress and for such\r\nlegislative enactments as may be found necessary or expedient in\r\nrelation to either of them.\r\n\r\nTo watch over and foster the interests of a gradually increasing and\r\nwidely extended commerce, to guard the rights of American citizens whom\r\nbusiness or pleasure or other motives may tempt into distant climes,\r\nand at the same time to cultivate those sentiments of mutual respect and\r\ngood will which experience has proved so beneficial in international\r\nintercourse, the Government of the United States has deemed it expedient\r\nfrom time to time to establish diplomatic connections with different\r\nforeign states, by the appointment of representatives to reside within\r\ntheir respective territories. I am gratified to be enabled to announce\r\nto you that since the close of your last session these relations have\r\nbeen opened under the happiest auspices with Austria and the Two\r\nSicilies, that new nominations have been made in the respective missions\r\nof Russia, Brazil, Belgium, and Sweden and Norway in this country, and\r\nthat a minister extraordinary has been received, accredited to this\r\nGovernment, from the Argentine Confederation.\r\n\r\nAn exposition of the fiscal affairs of the Government and of their\r\ncondition for the past year will be made to you by the Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury.\r\n\r\nThe available balance in the Treasury on the 1st of January next is\r\nestimated at $2,765,342. The receipts of the year from customs and lands\r\nwill probably amount to $20,615,598. These usual sources of revenue\r\nhave been increased by an issue of Treasury notes, of which less than\r\n$8,000,000, including interest and principal, will be outstanding at the\r\nend of the year, and by the sale of one of the bonds of the Bank of the\r\nUnited States for $2,254,871. The aggregate of means from these and\r\nother sources, with the balance on hand on the 1st of January last, has\r\nbeen applied to the payment of appropriations by Congress. The whole\r\nexpenditure for the year on their account, including the redemption of\r\nmore than eight millions of Treasury notes, constitutes an aggregate\r\nof about $40,000,000, and will still leave in the Treasury the balance\r\nbefore stated.\r\n\r\nNearly $8,000,000 of Treasury notes are to be paid during the coming\r\nyear in addition to the ordinary appropriations for the support of\r\nGovernment. For both these purposes the resources of the Treasury will\r\nundoubtedly be sufficient if the charges upon it are not increased\r\nbeyond the annual estimates. No excess, however, is likely to exist. Nor\r\ncan the postponed installment of the surplus revenue be deposited with\r\nthe States nor any considerable appropriations beyond the estimates be\r\nmade without causing a deficiency in the Treasury. The great caution,\r\nadvisable at all times, of limiting appropriations to the wants of the\r\npublic service is rendered necessary at present by the prospective and\r\nrapid reduction of the tariff, while the vigilant jealousy evidently\r\nexcited among the people by the occurrences of the last few years\r\nassures us that they expect from their representatives, and will sustain\r\nthem in the exercise of, the most rigid economy. Much can be effected\r\nby postponing appropriations not immediately required for the ordinary\r\npublic service or for any pressing emergency, and much by reducing the\r\nexpenditures where the entire and immediate accomplishment of the\r\nobjects in view is not indispensable.\r\n\r\nWhen we call to mind the recent and extreme embarrassments produced by\r\nexcessive issues of bank paper, aggravated by the unforeseen withdrawal\r\nof much foreign capital and the inevitable derangement arising from the\r\ndistribution of the surplus revenue among the States as required by\r\nCongress, and consider the heavy expenses incurred by the removal of\r\nIndian tribes, by the military operations in Florida, and on account of\r\nthe unusually large appropriations made at the last two annual sessions\r\nof Congress for other objects, we have striking evidence in the present\r\nefficient state of our finances of the abundant resources of the country\r\nto fulfill all its obligations. Nor is it less gratifying to find that\r\nthe general business of the community, deeply affected as it has been,\r\nis reviving with additional vigor, chastened by the lessons of the\r\npast and animated by the hopes of the future. By the curtailment\r\nof paper issues, by curbing the sanguine and adventurous spirit of\r\nspeculation, and by the honorable application of all available means to\r\nthe fulfillment of obligations, confidence has been restored both at\r\nhome and abroad, and ease and facility secured to all the operations\r\nof trade.\r\n\r\nThe agency of the Government in producing these results has been as\r\nefficient as its powers and means permitted. By withholding from the\r\nStates the deposit of the fourth installment, and leaving several\r\nmillions at long credits with the banks, principally in one section of\r\nthe country, and more immediately beneficial to it, and at the same\r\ntime aiding the banks and commercial communities in other sections by\r\npostponing the payment of bonds for duties to the amount of between four\r\nand five millions of dollars; by an issue of Treasury notes as a means\r\nto enable the Government to meet the consequences of their indulgences,\r\nbut affording at the same time facilities for remittance and exchange;\r\nand by steadily declining to employ as general depositories of the\r\npublic revenues, or receive the notes of, all banks which refused to\r\nredeem them with specie--by these measures, aided by the favorable\r\naction of some of the banks and by the support and cooperation of a\r\nlarge portion of the community, we have witnessed an early resumption\r\nof specie payments in our great commercial capital, promptly followed\r\nin almost every part of the United States. This result has been\r\nalike salutary to the true interests of agriculture, commerce, and\r\nmanufactures; to public morals, respect for the laws, and that\r\nconfidence between man and man which is so essential in all our\r\nsocial relations.\r\n\r\nThe contrast between the suspension of 1814 and that of 1837 is most\r\nstriking. The short duration of the latter, the prompt restoration\r\nof business, the evident benefits resulting from an adherence by\r\nthe Government to the constitutional standard of value instead of\r\nsanctioning the suspension by the receipt of irredeemable paper, and the\r\nadvantages derived from the large amount of specie introduced into the\r\ncountry previous to 1837 afford a valuable illustration of the true\r\npolicy of the Government in such a crisis. Nor can the comparison fail\r\nto remove the impression that a national bank is necessary in such\r\nemergencies. Not only were specie payments resumed without its aid, but\r\nexchanges have also been more rapidly restored than when it existed,\r\nthereby showing that private capital, enterprise, and prudence are fully\r\nadequate to these ends. On all these points experience seems to have\r\nconfirmed the views heretofore submitted to Congress. We have been\r\nsaved the mortification of seeing the distresses of the community for\r\nthe third time seized on to fasten upon the country so dangerous an\r\ninstitution, and we may also hope that the business of individuals\r\nwill hereafter be relieved from the injurious effects of a continued\r\nagitation of that disturbing subject. The limited influence of a\r\nnational bank in averting derangement in the exchanges of the country\r\nor in compelling the resumption of specie payments is now not less\r\napparent than its tendency to increase inordinate speculation by sudden\r\nexpansions and contractions; its disposition to create panic and\r\nembarrassment for the promotion of its own designs; its interference\r\nwith politics, and its far greater power for evil than for good, either\r\nin regard to the local institutions or the operations of Government\r\nitself. What was in these respects but apprehension or opinion when a\r\nnational bank was first established now stands confirmed by humiliating\r\nexperience. The scenes through which we have passed conclusively prove\r\nhow little our commerce, agriculture, manufactures, or finances require\r\nsuch an institution, and what dangers are attendant on its power--a\r\npower, I trust, never to be conferred by the American people upon their\r\nGovernment, and still less upon individuals not responsible to them for\r\nits unavoidable abuses.\r\n\r\nMy conviction of the necessity of further legislative provisions for\r\nthe safe-keeping and disbursement of the public moneys and my opinion\r\nin regard to the measures best adapted to the accomplishment of those\r\nobjects have been already submitted to you. These have been strengthened\r\nby recent events, and in the full conviction that time and experience\r\nmust still further demonstrate their propriety I feel it my duty, with\r\nrespectful deference to the conflicting views of others, again to invite\r\nyour attention to them.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of limited sums deposited in the few banks still\r\nemployed under the act of 1836, the amounts received for duties, and,\r\nwith very inconsiderable exceptions, those accruing from lands also,\r\nhave since the general suspension of specie payments by the deposit\r\nbanks been kept and disbursed by the Treasurer under his general legal\r\npowers, subject to the superintendence of the Secretary of the Treasury.\r\nThe propriety of defining more specifically and of regulating by law the\r\nexercise of this wide scope of Executive discretion has been already\r\nsubmitted to Congress.\r\n\r\nA change in the office of collector at one of our principal ports has\r\nbrought to light a defalcation of the gravest character, the particulars\r\nof which will be laid before you in a special report from the Secretary\r\nof the Treasury. By his report and the accompanying documents it will\r\nbe seen that the weekly returns of the defaulting officer apparently\r\nexhibited throughout a faithful administration of the affairs intrusted\r\nto his management. It, however, now appears that he commenced\r\nabstracting the public moneys shortly after his appointment and\r\ncontinued to do so, progressively increasing the amount, for the term\r\nof more than seven years, embracing a portion of the period during which\r\nthe public moneys were deposited in the Bank of the United States, the\r\nwhole of that of the State bank deposit system, and concluding only on\r\nhis retirement from office, after that system had substantially failed\r\nin consequence of the suspension of specie payments.\r\n\r\nThe way in which this defalcation was so long concealed and the steps\r\ntaken to indemnify the United States, as far as practicable, against\r\nloss will also be presented to you. The case is one which imperatively\r\nclaims the attention of Congress and furnishes the strongest motive\r\nfor the establishment of a more severe and secure system for the\r\nsafe-keeping and disbursement of the public moneys than any that has\r\nheretofore existed.\r\n\r\nIt seems proper, at all events, that by an early enactment similar to\r\nthat of other countries the application of public money by an officer\r\nof Government to private uses should be made a felony and visited with\r\nsevere and ignominious punishment. This is already in effect the law\r\nin respect to the Mint, and has been productive of the most salutary\r\nresults. Whatever system is adopted, such an enactment would be wise as\r\nan independent measure, since much of the public moneys must in their\r\ncollection and ultimate disbursement pass twice through the hands of\r\npublic officers, in whatever manner they are intermediately kept.\r\nThe Government, it must be admitted, has been from its commencement\r\ncomparatively fortunate in this respect. But the appointing power can\r\nnot always be well advised in its selections, and the experience of\r\nevery country has shown that public officers are not at all times proof\r\nagainst temptation. It is a duty, therefore, which the Government\r\nowes, as well to the interests committed to its care as to the officers\r\nthemselves, to provide every guard against transgressions of this\r\ncharacter that is consistent with reason and humanity. Congress can not\r\nbe too jealous of the conduct of those who are intrusted with the public\r\nmoney, and I shall at all times be disposed to encourage a watchful\r\ndischarge of this duty.\r\n\r\nIf a more direct cooperation on the part of Congress in the\r\nsupervision of the conduct of the officers intrusted with the custody\r\nand application of the public money is deemed desirable, it will\r\ngive me pleasure to assist in the establishment of any judicious and\r\nconstitutional plan by which that object may be accomplished. You will\r\nin your wisdom determine upon the propriety of adopting such a plan and\r\nupon the measures necessary to its effectual execution. When the late\r\nBank of the United States was incorporated and made the depository of\r\nthe public moneys, a right was reserved to Congress to inspect at its\r\npleasure, by a committee of that body, the books and the proceedings of\r\nthe bank. In one of the States, whose banking institutions are supposed\r\nto rank amongst the first in point of stability, they are subjected to\r\nconstant examination by commissioners appointed for that purpose, and\r\nmuch of the success of its banking system is attributed to this watchful\r\nsupervision.\r\n\r\nThe same course has also, in view of its beneficial operation, been\r\nadopted by an adjoining State, favorably known for the care it has\r\nalways bestowed upon whatever relates to its financial concerns.\r\nI submit to your consideration whether a committee of Congress might\r\nnot be profitably employed in inspecting, at such intervals as might\r\nbe deemed proper, the affairs and accounts of officers intrusted with\r\nthe custody of the public moneys. The frequent performance of this duty\r\nmight be made obligatory on the committee in respect to those officers\r\nwho have large sums in their possession, and left discretionary in\r\nrespect to others. They might report to the Executive such defalcations\r\nas were found to exist, with a view to a prompt removal from office\r\nunless the default was satisfactorily accounted for, and report also\r\nto Congress, at the commencement of each session, the result of\r\ntheir examinations and proceedings. It does appear to me that with a\r\nsubjection of this class of public officers to the general supervision\r\nof the Executive, to examinations by a committee of Congress at periods\r\nof which they should have no previous notice, and to prosecution and\r\npunishment as for felony for every breach of trust, the safe-keeping\r\nof the public moneys might under the system proposed be placed on a\r\nsurer foundation than it has ever occupied since the establishment\r\nof the Government.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Treasury will lay before you additional information\r\ncontaining new details on this interesting subject. To these I ask your\r\nearly attention. That it should have given rise to great diversity of\r\nopinion can not be a subject of surprise. After the collection and\r\ncustody of the public moneys had been for so many years connected with\r\nand made subsidiary to the advancement of private interests, a return\r\nto the simple self-denying ordinances of the Constitution could not but\r\nbe difficult. But time and free discussion, eliciting the sentiments\r\nof the people, and aided by that conciliatory spirit which has ever\r\ncharacterized their course on great emergencies, were relied upon for a\r\nsatisfactory settlement of the question. Already has this anticipation,\r\non one important point at least--the impropriety of diverting public\r\nmoney to private purposes--been fully realized. There is no reason to\r\nsuppose that legislation upon that branch of the subject would now be\r\nembarrassed by a difference of opinion, or fail to receive the cordial\r\nsupport of a large majority of our constituents.\r\n\r\nThe connection which formerly existed between the Government and banks\r\nwas in reality injurious to both, as well as to the general interests\r\nof the community at large. It aggravated the disasters of trade and\r\nthe derangements of commercial intercourse, and administered new\r\nexcitements and additional means to wild and reckless speculations, the\r\ndisappointment of which threw the country into convulsions of panic, and\r\nall but produced violence and bloodshed. The imprudent expansion of bank\r\ncredits, which was the natural result of the command of the revenues\r\nof the State, furnished the resources for unbounded license in every\r\nspecies of adventure, seduced industry from its regular and salutary\r\noccupations by the hope of abundance without labor, and deranged the\r\nsocial state by tempting all trades and professions into the vortex\r\nof speculation on remote contingencies.\r\n\r\nThe same wide-spreading influence impeded also the resources of the\r\nGovernment, curtailed its useful operations, embarrassed the fulfillment\r\nof its obligations, and seriously interfered with the execution of\r\nthe laws. Large appropriations and oppressive taxes are the natural\r\nconsequences of such a connection, since they increase the profits\r\nof those who are allowed to use the public funds, and make it their\r\ninterest that money should be accumulated and expenditures multiplied.\r\nIt is thus that a concentrated money power is tempted to become an\r\nactive agent in political affairs; and all past experience has shown\r\non which side that influence will be arrayed. We deceive ourselves if\r\nwe suppose that it will ever be found asserting and supporting the\r\nrights of the community at large in opposition to the claims of the few.\r\n\r\nIn a government whose distinguishing characteristic should be a\r\ndiffusion and equalization of its benefits and burdens the advantage of\r\nindividuals will be augmented at the expense of the community at large.\r\nNor is it the nature of combinations for the acquisition of legislative\r\ninfluence to confine their interference to the single object for which\r\nthey were originally formed. The temptation to extend it to other\r\nmatters is, on the contrary, not unfrequently too strong to be resisted.\r\nThe rightful influence in the direction of public affairs of the mass\r\nof the people is therefore in no slight danger of being sensibly and\r\ninjuriously affected by giving to a comparatively small but very\r\nefficient class a direct and exclusive personal interest in so important\r\na portion of the legislation of Congress as that which relates to the\r\ncustody of the public moneys. If laws acting upon private interests can\r\nnot always be avoided, they should be confined within the narrowest\r\nlimits, and left wherever possible to the legislatures of the States.\r\nWhen not thus restricted they lead to combinations of powerful\r\nassociations, foster an influence necessarily selfish, and turn the\r\nfair course of legislation to sinister ends rather than to objects\r\nthat advance public liberty and promote the general good.\r\n\r\nThe whole subject now rests with you, and I can not but express a hope\r\nthat some definite measure will be adopted at the present session.\r\n\r\nIt will not, I am sure, be deemed out of place for me here to remark\r\nthat the declaration of my views in opposition to the policy of\r\nemploying banks as depositories of the Government funds can not justly\r\nbe construed as indicative of hostility, official or personal, to those\r\ninstitutions; or to repeat in this form and in connection with this\r\nsubject opinions which I have uniformly entertained and on all proper\r\noccasions expressed. Though always opposed to their creation in the\r\nform of exclusive privileges, and, as a State magistrate, aiming by\r\nappropriate legislation to secure the community against the consequences\r\nof their occasional mismanagement, I have yet ever wished to see them\r\nprotected in the exercise of rights conferred by law, and have never\r\ndoubted their utility when properly managed in promoting the interests\r\nof trade, and through that channel the other interests of the community.\r\nTo the General Government they present themselves merely as State\r\ninstitutions, having no necessary connection with its legislation or its\r\nadministration. Like other State establishments, they may be used or not\r\nin conducting the affairs of the Government, as public policy and the\r\ngeneral interests of the Union may seem to require. The only safe or\r\nproper principle upon which their intercourse with the Government can\r\nbe regulated is that which regulates their intercourse with the private\r\ncitizen--the conferring of mutual benefits. When the Government can\r\naccomplish a financial operation better with the aid of the banks than\r\nwithout it, it should be at liberty to seek that aid as it would the\r\nservices of a private banker or other capitalist or agent, giving the\r\npreference to those who will serve it on the best terms. Nor can there\r\never exist an interest in the officers of the General Government, as\r\nsuch, inducing them to embarrass or annoy the State banks any more than\r\nto incur the hostility of any other class of State institutions or of\r\nprivate citizens. It is not in the nature of things that hostility to\r\nthese institutions can spring from this source, or any opposition to\r\ntheir course of business, except when they themselves depart from the\r\nobjects of their creation and attempt to usurp powers not conferred\r\nupon them or to subvert the standard of value established by the\r\nConstitution. While opposition to their regular operations can not\r\nexist in this quarter, resistance to any attempt to make the Government\r\ndependent upon them for the successful administration of public affairs\r\nis a matter of duty, as I trust it ever will be of inclination, no\r\nmatter from what motive or consideration the attempt may originate.\r\n\r\nIt is no more than just to the banks to say that in the late\r\nemergency most of them firmly resisted the strongest temptations to\r\nextend their paper issues when apparently sustained in a suspension of\r\nspecie payments by public opinion, even though in some cases invited\r\nby legislative enactments. To this honorable course, aided by the\r\nresistance of the General Government, acting in obedience to the\r\nConstitution and laws of the United States, to the introduction of\r\nan irredeemable paper medium, may be attributed in a great degree the\r\nspeedy restoration of our currency to a sound state and the business\r\nof the country to its wonted prosperity.\r\n\r\nThe banks have but to continue in the same safe course and be content\r\nin their appropriate sphere to avoid all interference from the General\r\nGovernment and to derive from it all the protection and benefits which\r\nit bestows on other State establishments, on the people of the States,\r\nand on the States themselves. In this, their true position, they can\r\nnot but secure the confidence and good will of the people and the\r\nGovernment, which they can only lose when, leaping from their legitimate\r\nsphere, they attempt to control the legislation of the country and\r\npervert the operations of the Government to their own purposes.\r\n\r\nOur experience under the act, passed at the last session, to grant\r\npreemption rights to settlers on the public lands has as yet been too\r\nlimited to enable us to pronounce with safety upon the efficacy of its\r\nprovisions to carry out the wise and liberal policy of the Government in\r\nthat respect. There is, however, the best reason to anticipate favorable\r\nresults from its operation. The recommendations formerly submitted to\r\nyou in respect to a graduation of the price of the public lands remain\r\nto be finally acted upon. Having found no reason to change the views\r\nthen expressed, your attention to them is again respectfully requested.\r\n\r\nEvery proper exertion has been made and will be continued to carry out\r\nthe wishes of Congress in relation to the tobacco trade, as indicated\r\nin the several resolutions of the House of Representatives and the\r\nlegislation of the two branches. A favorable impression has, I trust,\r\nbeen made in the different foreign countries to which particular\r\nattention has been directed; and although we can not hope for an early\r\nchange in their policy, as in many of them a convenient and large\r\nrevenue is derived from monopolies in the fabrication and sale of this\r\narticle, yet, as these monopolies are really injurious to the people\r\nwhere they are established, and the revenue derived from them may be\r\nless injuriously and with equal facility obtained from another and a\r\nliberal system of administration, we can not doubt that our efforts\r\nwill be eventually crowned with success if persisted in with temperate\r\nfirmness and sustained by prudent legislation.\r\n\r\nIn recommending to Congress the adoption of the necessary provisions\r\nat this session for taking the next census or enumeration of the\r\ninhabitants of the United States, the suggestion presents itself whether\r\nthe scope of the measure might not be usefully extended by causing it to\r\nembrace authentic statistical returns of the great interests specially\r\nintrusted to or necessarily affected by the legislation of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying report of the Secretary of War presents a satisfactory\r\naccount of the state of the Army and of the several branches of the\r\npublic service confided to the superintendence of that officer.\r\n\r\nThe law increasing and organizing the military establishment of the\r\nUnited States has been nearly carried into effect, and the Army has\r\nbeen extensively and usefully employed during the past season.\r\n\r\nI would again call to your notice the subjects connected with\r\nand essential to the military defenses of the country which were\r\nsubmitted to you at the last session, but which were not acted upon,\r\nas is supposed, for want of time. The most important of them is the\r\norganization of the militia on the maritime and inland frontiers. This\r\nmeasure is deemed important, as it is believed that it will furnish an\r\neffective volunteer force in aid of the Regular Army, and may form the\r\nbasis of a general system of organization for the entire militia of\r\nthe United States. The erection of a national foundry and gunpowder\r\nmanufactory, and one for making small arms, the latter to be situated\r\nat some point west of the Allegany Mountains, all appear to be of\r\nsufficient importance to be again urged upon your attention.\r\n\r\nThe plan proposed by the Secretary of War for the distribution of the\r\nforces of the United States in time of peace is well calculated to\r\npromote regularity and economy in the fiscal administration of the\r\nservice, to preserve the discipline of the troops, and to render them\r\navailable for the maintenance of the peace and tranquillity of the\r\ncountry. With this view, likewise, I recommend the adoption of the plan\r\npresented by that officer for the defense of the western frontier. The\r\npreservation of the lives and property of our fellow-citizens who are\r\nsettled upon that border country, as well as the existence of the Indian\r\npopulation, which might be tempted by our want of preparation to rush\r\non their own destruction and attack the white settlements, all seem to\r\nrequire that this subject should be acted upon without delay, and the\r\nWar Department authorized to place that country in a state of complete\r\ndefense against any assault from the numerous and warlike tribes which\r\nare congregated on that border.\r\n\r\nIt affords me sincere pleasure to be able to apprise you of the entire\r\nremoval of the Cherokee Nation of Indians to their new homes west of the\r\nMississippi. The measures authorized by Congress at its last session,\r\nwith a view to the long-standing controversy with them, have had the\r\nhappiest effects. By an agreement concluded with them by the commanding\r\ngeneral in that country, who has performed the duties assigned to him\r\non the occasion with commendable energy and humanity, their removal has\r\nbeen principally under the conduct of their own chiefs, and they have\r\nemigrated without any apparent reluctance.\r\n\r\nThe successful accomplishment of this important object, the removal\r\nalso of the entire Creek Nation with the exception of a small number\r\nof fugitives amongst the Seminoles in Florida, the progress already\r\nmade toward a speedy completion of the removal of the Chickasaws, the\r\nChoctaws, the Pottawatamies, the Ottawas, and the Chippewas, with the\r\nextensive purchases of Indian lands during the present year, have\r\nrendered the speedy and successful result of the long-established policy\r\nof the Government upon the subject of Indian affairs entirely certain.\r\nThe occasion is therefore deemed a proper one to place this policy in\r\nsuch a point of view as will exonerate the Government of the United\r\nStates from the undeserved reproach which has been cast upon it through\r\nseveral successive Administrations. That a mixed occupancy of the same\r\nterritory by the white and red man is incompatible with the safety\r\nor happiness of either is a position in respect to which there has\r\nlong since ceased to be room for a difference of opinion. Reason and\r\nexperience have alike demonstrated its impracticability. The bitter\r\nfruits of every attempt heretofore to overcome the barriers interposed\r\nby nature have only been destruction, both physical and moral, to the\r\nIndian, dangerous conflicts of authority between the Federal and State\r\nGovernments, and detriment to the individual prosperity of the citizen\r\nas well as to the general improvement of the country. The remedial\r\npolicy, the principles of which were settled more than thirty years ago\r\nunder the Administration of Mr. Jefferson, consists in an extinction,\r\nfor a fair consideration, of the title to all the lands still occupied\r\nby the Indians within the States and Territories of the United States;\r\ntheir removal to a country west of the Mississippi much more extensive\r\nand better adapted to their condition than that on which they then\r\nresided; the guarantee to them by the United States of their exclusive\r\npossession of that country forever, exempt from all intrusions by white\r\nmen, with ample provisions for their security against external violence\r\nand internal dissensions, and the extension to them of suitable\r\nfacilities for their advancement in civilization. This has not been the\r\npolicy of particular Administrations only, but of each in succession\r\nsince the first attempt to carry it out under that of Mr. Monroe. All\r\nhave labored for its accomplishment, only with different degrees of\r\nsuccess. The manner of its execution has, it is true, from time to\r\ntime given rise to conflicts of opinion and unjust imputations; but in\r\nrespect to the wisdom and necessity of the policy itself there has not\r\nfrom the beginning existed a doubt in the mind of any calm, judicious,\r\ndisinterested friend of the Indian race accustomed to reflection and\r\nenlightened by experience.\r\n\r\nOccupying the double character of contractor on its own account and\r\nguardian for the parties contracted with, it was hardly to be expected\r\nthat the dealings of the Federal Government with the Indian tribes would\r\nescape misrepresentation. That there occurred in the early settlement of\r\nthis country, as in all others where the civilized race has succeeded to\r\nthe possessions of the savage, instances of oppression and fraud on the\r\npart of the former there is too much reason to believe. No such offenses\r\ncan, however, be justly charged upon this Government since it became\r\nfree to pursue its own course. Its dealings with the Indian tribes\r\nhave been just and friendly throughout; its efforts for their\r\ncivilization constant, and directed by the best feelings of humanity;\r\nits watchfulness in protecting them from individual frauds unremitting;\r\nits forbearance under the keenest provocations, the deepest injuries,\r\nand the most flagrant outrages may challenge at least a comparison with\r\nany nation, ancient or modern, in similar circumstances; and if in\r\nfuture times a powerful, civilized, and happy nation of Indians shall\r\nbe found to exist within the limits of this northern continent it will\r\nbe owing to the consummation of that policy which has been so unjustly\r\nassailed. Only a very brief reference to facts in confirmation of this\r\nassertion can in this form be given, and you are therefore necessarily\r\nreferred to the report of the Secretary of War for further details.\r\nTo the Cherokees, whose case has perhaps excited the greatest share of\r\nattention and sympathy, the United States have granted in fee, with a\r\nperpetual guaranty of exclusive and peaceable possession, 13,554,135\r\nacres of land on the west side of the Mississippi, eligibly situated, in\r\na healthy climate, and in all respects better suited to their condition\r\nthan the country they have left, in exchange for only 9,492,160 acres\r\non the east side of the same river. The United States have in addition\r\nstipulated to pay them $5,600,000 for their interest in and improvements\r\non the lands thus relinquished, and $1,160,000 for subsistence and other\r\nbeneficial purposes, thereby putting it in their power to become one of\r\nthe most wealthy and independent separate communities of the same extent\r\nin the world.\r\n\r\nBy the treaties made and ratified with the Miamies, the Chippewas, the\r\nSioux, the Sacs and Foxes, and the Winnebagoes during the last year the\r\nIndian title to 18,458,000 acres has been extinguished. These purchases\r\nhave been much more extensive than those of any previous year, and have,\r\nwith other Indian expenses, borne very heavily upon the Treasury. They\r\nleave, however, but a small quantity of unbought Indian lands within the\r\nStates and Territories, and the Legislature and Executive were equally\r\nsensible of the propriety of a final and more speedy extinction of\r\nIndian titles within those limits. The treaties, which were with a\r\nsingle exception made in pursuance of previous appropriations for\r\ndefraying the expenses, have subsequently been ratified by the Senate,\r\nand received the sanction of Congress by the appropriations necessary\r\nto carry them into effect. Of the terms upon which these important\r\nnegotiations were concluded I can speak from direct knowledge, and\r\nI feel no difficulty in affirming that the interest of the Indians in\r\nthe extensive territory embraced by them is to be paid for at its fair\r\nvalue, and that no more favorable terms have been granted to the United\r\nStates than would have been reasonably expected in a negotiation with\r\ncivilized men fully capable of appreciating and protecting their own\r\nrights. For the Indian title to 116,349,897 acres acquired since the\r\n4th of March, 1829, the United States have paid $72,560,056 in permanent\r\nannuities, lands, reservations for Indians, expenses of removal and\r\nsubsistence, merchandise, mechanical and agricultural establishments and\r\nimplements. When the heavy expenses incurred by the United States and\r\nthe circumstance that so large a portion of the entire territory will be\r\nforever unsalable are considered, and this price is compared with that\r\nfor which the United States sell their own lands, no one can doubt that\r\njustice has been done to the Indians in these purchases also. Certain\r\nit is that the transactions of the Federal Government with the Indians\r\nhave been uniformly characterized by a sincere and paramount desire\r\nto promote their welfare; and it must be a source of the highest\r\ngratification to every friend to justice and humanity to learn that\r\nnotwithstanding the obstructions from time to time thrown in its way and\r\nthe difficulties which have arisen from the peculiar and impracticable\r\nnature of the Indian character, the wise, humane, and undeviating policy\r\nof the Government in this the most difficult of all our relations,\r\nforeign or domestic, has at length been justified to the world in its\r\nnear approach to a happy and certain consummation.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the tribes which occupy the country set apart for them\r\nin the West is highly prosperous, and encourages the hope of their early\r\ncivilization. They have for the most part abandoned the hunter state and\r\nturned their attention to agricultural pursuits. All those who have been\r\nestablished for any length of time in that fertile region maintain\r\nthemselves by their own industry. There are among them traders of no\r\ninconsiderable capital, and planters exporting cotton to some extent,\r\nbut the greater number are small agriculturists, living in comfort upon\r\nthe produce of their farms. The recent emigrants, although they have in\r\nsome instances removed reluctantly, have readily acquiesced in their\r\nunavoidable destiny. They have found at once a recompense for past\r\nsufferings and an incentive to industrious habits in the abundance and\r\ncomforts around them. There is reason to believe that all these tribes\r\nare friendly in their feelings toward the United States; and it is to\r\nbe hoped that the acquisition of individual wealth, the pursuits of\r\nagriculture, and habits of industry will gradually subdue their warlike\r\npropensities and incline them to maintain peace among themselves. To\r\neffect this desirable object the attention of Congress is solicited\r\nto the measures recommended by the Secretary of War for their future\r\ngovernment and protection, as well from each other as from the hostility\r\nof the warlike tribes around them and the intrusions of the whites. The\r\npolicy of the Government has given them a permanent home and guaranteed\r\nto them its peaceful and undisturbed possession. It only remains to give\r\nthem a government and laws which will encourage industry and secure\r\nto them the rewards of their exertions. The importance of some form\r\nof government can not be too much insisted upon. The earliest effects\r\nwill be to diminish the causes and occasions for hostilities among\r\nthe tribes, to inspire an interest in the observance of laws to which\r\nthey will have themselves assented, and to multiply the securities of\r\nproperty and the motives for self-improvement. Intimately connected with\r\nthis subject is the establishment of the military defenses recommended\r\nby the Secretary of War, which have been already referred to. Without\r\nthem the Government will be powerless to redeem its pledge of protection\r\nto the emigrating Indians against the numerous warlike tribes that\r\nsurround them and to provide for the safety of the frontier settlers\r\nof the bordering States.\r\n\r\nThe case of the Seminoles constitutes at present the only exception to\r\nthe successful efforts of the Government to remove the Indians to the\r\nhomes assigned them west of the Mississippi. Four hundred of this tribe\r\nemigrated in 1836 and 1,500 in 1837 and 1838, leaving in the country,\r\nit is supposed, about 2,000 Indians. The continued treacherous conduct\r\nof these people; the savage and unprovoked murders they have lately\r\ncommitted, butchering whole families of the settlers of the Territory\r\nwithout distinction of age or sex, and making their way into the very\r\ncenter and heart of the country, so that no part of it is free from\r\ntheir ravages; their frequent attacks on the light-houses along that\r\ndangerous coast, and the barbarity with which they have murdered the\r\npassengers and crews of such vessels as have been wrecked upon the reefs\r\nand keys which border the Gulf, leave the Government no alternative but\r\nto continue the military operations against them until they are totally\r\nexpelled from Florida. There are other motives which would urge the\r\nGovernment to pursue this course toward the Seminoles. The United\r\nStates have fulfilled in good faith all their treaty stipulations with\r\nthe Indian tribes, and have in every other instance insisted upon a\r\nlike performance of their obligations. To relax from this salutary\r\nrule because the Seminoles have maintained themselves so long in the\r\nterritory they had relinquished, and in defiance of their frequent and\r\nsolemn engagements still continue to wage a ruthless war against the\r\nUnited States, would not only evince a want of constancy on our part,\r\nbut be of evil example in our intercourse with other tribes. Experience\r\nhas shown that but little is to be gained by the march of armies through\r\na country so intersected with inaccessible swamps and marshes, and\r\nwhich, from the fatal character of the climate, must be abandoned at the\r\nend of the winter. I recommend, therefore, to your attention the plan\r\nsubmitted by the Secretary of War in the accompanying report, for the\r\npermanent occupation of the portion of the Territory freed from the\r\nIndians and the more efficient protection of the people of Florida from\r\ntheir inhuman warfare.\r\n\r\nFrom the report of the Secretary of the Navy herewith transmitted it\r\nwill appear that a large portion of the disposable naval force is either\r\nactively employed or in a state of preparation for the purposes of\r\nexperience and discipline and the protection of our commerce. So\r\neffectual has been this protection that so far as the information of\r\nGovernment extends not a single outrage has been attempted on a vessel\r\ncarrying the flag of the United States within the present year, in any\r\nquarter, however distant or exposed.\r\n\r\nThe exploring expedition sailed from Norfolk on the 19th of August last,\r\nand information has been received of its safe arrival at the island of\r\nMadeira. The best spirit animates the officers and crews, and there is\r\nevery reason to anticipate from its efforts results beneficial to\r\ncommerce and honorable to the nation.\r\n\r\nIt will also be seen that no reduction of the force now in commission is\r\ncontemplated. The unsettled state of a portion of South America renders\r\nit indispensable that our commerce should receive protection in that\r\nquarter; the vast and increasing interests embarked in the trade of the\r\nIndian and China seas, in the whale fisheries of the Pacific Ocean, and\r\nin the Gulf of Mexico require equal attention to their safety, and a\r\nsmall squadron may be employed to great advantage on our Atlantic coast\r\nin meeting sudden demands for the reenforcement of other stations, in\r\naiding merchant vessels in distress, in affording active service to an\r\nadditional number of officers, and in visiting the different ports of\r\nthe United States, an accurate knowledge of which is obviously of the\r\nhighest importance.\r\n\r\nThe attention of Congress is respectfully called to that portion of the\r\nreport recommending an increase in the number of smaller vessels, and\r\nto other suggestions contained in that document. The rapid increase and\r\nwide expansion of our commerce, which is every day seeking new avenues\r\nof profitable adventure; the absolute necessity of a naval force for its\r\nprotection precisely in the degree of its extension; a due regard to the\r\nnational rights and honor; the recollection of its former exploits, and\r\nthe anticipation of its future triumphs whenever opportunity presents\r\nitself, which we may rightfully indulge from the experience of the\r\npast--all seem to point to the Navy as a most efficient arm of our\r\nnational defense and a proper object of legislative encouragement.\r\n\r\nThe progress and condition of the Post-Office Department will be seen\r\nby reference to the report of the Postmaster-General. The extent of\r\npost-roads covered by mail contracts is stated to be 134,818 miles,\r\nand the annual transportation upon them 34,580,202 miles. The number\r\nof post-offices in the United States is 12,553, and rapidly increasing.\r\nThe gross revenue for the year ending on the 30th day of June last\r\nwas $4,262,145; the accruing expenditures, $4,680,068; excess of\r\nexpenditures, $417,923. This has been made up out of the surplus\r\npreviously on hand. The cash on hand on the 1st instant was $314,068.\r\nThe revenue for the year ending June 30, 1838, was $161,540 more\r\nthan that for the year ending June 30, 1837. The expenditures of\r\nthe Department had been graduated upon the anticipation of a largely\r\nincreased revenue. A moderate curtailment of mail service consequently\r\nbecame necessary, and has been effected, to shield the Department\r\nagainst the danger of embarrassment. Its revenue is now improving, and\r\nit will soon resume its onward course in the march of improvement.\r\n\r\nYour particular attention is requested to so much of the\r\nPostmaster-General's report as relates to the transportation of the\r\nmails upon railroads. The laws on that subject do not seem adequate\r\nto secure that service, now become almost essential to the public\r\ninterests, and at the same time protect the Department from combinations\r\nand unreasonable demands.\r\n\r\nNor can I too earnestly request your attention to the necessity of\r\nproviding a more secure building for this Department. The danger of\r\ndestruction to which its important books and papers are continually\r\nexposed, as well from the highly combustible character of the building\r\noccupied as from that of others in the vicinity, calls loudly for prompt\r\naction.\r\n\r\nYour attention is again earnestly invited to the suggestions and\r\nrecommendations submitted at the last session in respect to the District\r\nof Columbia.\r\n\r\nI feel it my duty also to bring to your notice certain proceedings at\r\nlaw which have recently been prosecuted in this District in the name\r\nof the United States, on the relation of Messrs. Stockton & Stokes, of\r\nthe State of Maryland, against the Postmaster-General, and which have\r\nresulted in the payment of money out of the National Treasury, for\r\nthe first time since the establishment of the Government, by judicial\r\ncompulsion exercised by the common-law writ of mandamus issued by the\r\ncircuit court of this District.\r\n\r\nThe facts of the case and the grounds of the proceedings will be\r\nfound fully stated in the report of the decision, and any additional\r\ninformation which you may desire will be supplied by the proper\r\nDepartment. No interference in the particular case is contemplated.\r\nThe money has been paid, the claims of the prosecutors have been\r\nsatisfied, and the whole subject, so far as they are concerned, is\r\nfinally disposed of; but it is on the supposition that the case may\r\nbe regarded as an authoritative exposition of the law as it now stands\r\nthat I have thought it necessary to present it to your consideration.\r\n\r\nThe object of the application to the circuit court was to compel the\r\nPostmaster-General to carry into effect an award made by the Solicitor\r\nof the Treasury, under a special act of Congress for the settlement of\r\ncertain claims of the relators on the Post-Office Department, which\r\naward the Postmaster-General declined to execute in full until he should\r\nreceive further legislative direction on the subject. If the duty\r\nimposed on the Postmaster-General by that law was to be regarded as\r\none of an official nature, belonging to his office as a branch of the\r\nexecutive, then it is obvious that the constitutional competency of the\r\njudiciary to direct and control him in its discharge was necessarily\r\ndrawn in question; and if the duty so imposed on the Postmaster-General\r\nwas to be considered as merely ministerial, and not executive, it yet\r\nremained to be shown that the circuit court of this District had\r\nauthority to interfere by mandamus, such a power having never before\r\nbeen asserted or claimed by that court. With a view to the settlement of\r\nthese important questions, the judgment of the circuit court was carried\r\nby a writ of error to the Supreme Court of the United States. In the\r\nopinion of that tribunal the duty imposed on the Postmaster-General was\r\nnot an official executive duty, but one of a merely ministerial nature.\r\nThe grave constitutional questions which had been discussed were\r\ntherefore excluded from the decision of the case, the court, indeed,\r\nexpressly admitting that with powers and duties properly belonging to\r\nthe executive no other department can interfere by the writ of mandamus;\r\nand the question therefore resolved itself into this: Has Congress\r\nconferred upon the circuit court of this District the power to issue\r\nsuch a writ to an officer of the General Government commanding him to\r\nperform a ministerial act? A majority of the court have decided that it\r\nhas, but have founded their decision upon a process of reasoning which\r\nin my judgment renders further legislative provision indispensable to\r\nthe public interests and the equal administration of justice.\r\n\r\nIt has long since been decided by the Supreme Court that neither that\r\ntribunal nor the circuit courts of the United States, held within the\r\nrespective States, possess the power in question; but it is now held\r\nthat this power, denied to both of these high tribunals (to the former\r\nby the Constitution and to the latter by Congress), has been by its\r\nlegislation vested in the circuit court of this District. No such direct\r\ngrant of power to the circuit court of this District is claimed, but it\r\nhas been held to result by necessary implication from several sections\r\nof the law establishing the court. One of these sections declares that\r\nthe laws of Maryland, as they existed at the time of the cession,\r\nshould be in force in that part of the District ceded by that State,\r\nand by this provision the common law in civil and criminal cases, as\r\nit prevailed in Maryland in 1801, was established in that part of the\r\nDistrict.\r\n\r\nIn England the court of king's bench--because the Sovereign, who,\r\naccording to the theory of the constitution, is the fountain of justice,\r\noriginally sat there in person, and is still deemed to be present in\r\nconstruction of law--alone possesses the high power of issuing the writ\r\nof mandamus, not only to inferior jurisdictions and corporations, but\r\nalso to magistrates and others, commanding them in the King's name to do\r\nwhat their duty requires in cases where there is a vested right and no\r\nother specific remedy. It has been held in the case referred to that as\r\nthe Supreme Court of the United States is by the Constitution rendered\r\nincompetent to exercise this power, and as the circuit court of this\r\nDistrict is a court of general jurisdiction in cases at common law,\r\nand the highest court of original jurisdiction in the District, the\r\nright to issue the writ of mandamus is incident to its common-law\r\npowers. Another ground relied upon to maintain the power in question\r\nis that it was included by fair construction in the powers granted to\r\nthe circuit courts of the United States by the act \"to provide for the\r\nmore convenient organization of the courts of the United States,\" passed\r\n13th February, 1801; that the act establishing the circuit court of this\r\nDistrict, passed the 27th day of February, 1801, conferred upon that\r\ncourt and the judges thereof the same powers as were by law vested in\r\nthe circuit courts of the United States and in the judges of the said\r\ncourts; that the repeal of the first-mentioned act, which took place in\r\nthe next year, did not divest the circuit court of this District of the\r\nauthority in dispute, but left it still clothed with the powers over the\r\nsubject which, it is conceded, were taken away from the circuit courts\r\nof the United States by the repeal of the act of 13th February, 1801.\r\n\r\nAdmitting that the adoption of the laws of Maryland for a portion of\r\nthis District confers on the circuit court thereof, in that portion, the\r\ntranscendent extrajudicial prerogative powers of the court of king's\r\nbench in England, or that either of the acts of Congress by necessary\r\nimplication authorizes the former court to issue a writ of mandamus to\r\nan officer of the United States to compel him to perform a ministerial\r\nduty, the consequences are in one respect the same. The result in either\r\ncase is that the officers of the United States stationed in different\r\nparts of the United States are, in respect to the performance of\r\ntheir official duties, subject to different laws and a different\r\nsupervision--those in the States to one rule, and those in the District\r\nof Columbia to another and a very different one. In the District their\r\nofficial conduct is subject to a judicial control from which in the\r\nStates they are exempt.\r\n\r\nWhatever difference of opinion may exist as to the expediency of vesting\r\nsuch a power in the judiciary in a system of government constituted\r\nlike that of the United States, all must agree that these disparaging\r\ndiscrepancies in the law and in the administration of justice ought not\r\nto be permitted to continue; and as Congress alone can provide the\r\nremedy, the subject is unavoidably presented to your consideration.\r\n\r\nM. VAN BUREN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 6, 1838_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nThe act of the 1st July, 1836, to enable the Executive to assert and\r\nprosecute with effect the claim of the United States to the legacy\r\nbequeathed to them by James Smithson, late of London, having received\r\nits entire execution, and the amount recovered and paid into the\r\nTreasury having, agreeably to an act of the last session, been invested\r\nin State stocks, I deem it proper to invite the attention of Congress\r\nto the obligation now devolving upon the United States to fulfill the\r\nobject of the bequest. In order to obtain such information as might\r\nserve to facilitate its attainment, the Secretary of State was directed\r\nin July last to apply to persons versed in science and familiar with the\r\nsubject of public education for their views as to the mode of disposing\r\nof the fund best calculated to meet the intentions of the testator and\r\nprove most beneficial to mankind. Copies of the circular letter written\r\nin compliance with these directions, and of the answers to it received\r\nat the Department of State, are herewith communicated for the\r\nconsideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nM.

Your\r\nattention is invited to that section which reserves a tract of land for\r\nthe use of certain Indians, and to other reservations contained in the\r\ntreaty. All such reservations are objectionable, but for the reasons\r\ngiven by the Secretary of War I submit to your consideration whether the\r\ncircumstances attending this negotiation, and the great importance of\r\nremoving the Miamies from the State of Indiana, will warrant a departure\r\nin this instance from the salutary rule of excluding all reservations\r\nfrom Indian treaties.\r\n\r\nM.

In doing so I beg to call your\r\nattention to that section which reserves from the cession made by the\r\nMiamies a tract of land supposed to contain 10 square miles, and to\r\nother reservations according to a schedule appended to the treaty. The\r\ncommissioner who negotiated this treaty is of opinion that it could not\r\nhave been concluded if he had not so far departed from his instructions\r\nas to admit these reservations. And it is to be feared that if the\r\nrules adopted by the Department in this particular be insisted upon\r\non this occasion it will very much increase the difficulty, if it does\r\nnot render it impracticable to acquire this land and remove these\r\nIndians--objects of so much importance to the United States and\r\nespecially to the State of Indiana.\r\n\r\nVery respectfully, your most obedient servant,\r\n\r\nJ.R.

This tract of\r\nland was ceded by the treaty of 15th July, 1830, to them by the\r\nabove-mentioned tribes and bands of Indians, and can not be taken from\r\nthem, even for such a valuable consideration as will relieve their\r\nwants, without their assent.

The\r\nobject of this communication, accordingly, is to solicit the approval\r\nby the Senate of such an extension upon the conditions mentioned in the\r\nreport of the Secretary of State.\r\n\r\nM. VAN BUREN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE,\r\n\r\n_Washington, February 2, 1839_.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of State has the honor to report to the President that,\r\naccording to his instructions, Mr. Martinez, the Mexican minister\r\nplenipotentiary, was invited to the Department of State in order to\r\nascertain if he had any recent information on the subject of the\r\nconvention between the United States and Mexico, transmitted by him to\r\nMexico for ratification by his Government. Mr. Martinez called yesterday\r\nand stated that he was without definite information, but expected daily\r\nto receive it. He supposed the delay was occasioned by the troubled\r\ncondition of Mexican affairs, and hoped we would make all due allowances\r\nfor unavoidable delays. When asked if he had power to enlarge the time\r\nfor the exchange of ratifications, he said that all his instructions had\r\nbeen fulfilled on the signature of the treaty. The Secretary called his\r\nattention to information just received at the Department from Mexico\r\nthat the treaty was about to be submitted to the Mexican Congress, and\r\nhe was requested to state what had changed the views of his Government\r\non the question of ratifying the convention, he himself having stated,\r\npending the negotiation, that the President, Bustamente, believed he\r\nhad full power under the decree of the 20th of May, 1837, to ratify\r\nthe convention without a reference of it to Congress. He replied that\r\nhe did not know the causes which had produced this change of opinion.\r\nMr. Martinez appeared to be very solicitous to have it understood\r\nthat he had done everything in his power to hasten the exchange of\r\nratifications, and to have every allowance made in consequence of the\r\ndisturbed state of Mexico and her pending war with France. From this\r\nconversation and the accompanying extracts from two letters from the\r\nconsul of the United States at Mexico the President will see that it is\r\nby no means improbable, if the ratification of the convention should\r\nhave been decreed by the Congress of Mexico, that the ratification may\r\nnot reach the city of Washington until after the 10th of February. The\r\nSecretary therefore respectfully represents to the President whether\r\nit is not advisable to ask the consent of the Senate to the exchange\r\nof the ratifications after the expiration of the time limited, if such\r\nexchange shall be offered by the Mexican Government by their agent duly\r\nauthorized for that purpose. Unless this authority can be granted, a new\r\nconvention will have to be negotiated and the whole subject passed over\r\nuntil after the next session of Congress.\r\n\r\nAll which is respectfully submitted.\r\n\r\nJOHN FORSYTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Extract of a letter from the consul of the United States at Mexico,\r\ndated November 17, 1838.]\r\n\r\nOn the 13th Mr. Basave did me the honor to call on me, and informed\r\nme that he was requested by his excellency the minister of foreign\r\nrelations, Mr. Cuevas, to inform me that in consequence of his\r\nhaving to go to Jalapa to meet Admiral Baudin, the French minister\r\nplenipotentiary, he could not attend to the matters relating to the\r\nAmerican question in time for Mr. Basave to go back in the _Woodbury_,\r\nand wished, therefore, that she might not be detained, as was intended,\r\nfor the purpose of conveying to the United States Messrs.

VAN BUREN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 26, 1839_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI lay before Congress several dispatches from his excellency the\r\ngovernor of Maine, with inclosures, communicating certain proceedings of\r\nthe legislature of that State, and a copy of the reply of the Secretary\r\nof State, made by my direction, together with a note from H.S. Fox,\r\nesq., envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of Great Britain,\r\nwith the answer of the Secretary of State to the same.\r\n\r\nIt will appear from those documents that a numerous band of lawless and\r\ndesperate men, chiefly from the adjoining British Provinces, but without\r\nthe authority or sanction of the provincial government, had trespassed\r\nupon that portion of the territory in dispute between the United States\r\nand Great Britain which is watered by the river Aroostook and claimed\r\nto belong to the State of Maine, and that they had committed extensive\r\ndepredations there by cutting and destroying a very large quantity of\r\ntimber. It will further appear that the governor of Maine, having been\r\nofficially apprised of the circumstance, had communicated it to the\r\nlegislature with a recommendation of such provisions in addition to\r\nthose already existing by law as would enable him to arrest the course\r\nof said depredations, disperse the trespassers, and secure the timber\r\nwhich they were about carrying away; that, in compliance with a\r\nresolve of the legislature passed in pursuance of his recommendation,\r\nhis excellency had dispatched the land agent of the State, with a\r\nforce deemed adequate to that purpose, to the scene of the alleged\r\ndepredations, who, after accomplishing a part of his duty, was seized\r\nby a band of the trespassers at a house claimed to be within the\r\njurisdiction of Maine, whither he had repaired for the purpose of\r\nmeeting and consulting with the land agent of the Province of New\r\nBrunswick, and conveyed as a prisoner to Frederickton, in that Province,\r\ntogether with two other citizens of the State who were assisting him in\r\nthe discharge of his duty.\r\n\r\nIt will also appear that the governor and legislature of Maine,\r\nsatisfied that the trespassers had acted in defiance of the laws of\r\nboth countries, learning that they were in possession of arms, and\r\nanticipating (correctly, as the result has proved) that persons of their\r\nreckless and desperate character would set at naught the authority of\r\nthe magistrates without the aid of a strong force, had authorized the\r\nsheriff and the officer appointed in the place of the land agent to\r\nemploy, at the expense of the State, an armed posse, who had proceeded\r\nto the scene of these depredations with a view to the entire dispersion\r\nor arrest of the trespassers and the protection of the public property.\r\n\r\nIn the correspondence between the governor of Maine and Sir John Harvey,\r\nlieutenant-governor of the Province of New Brunswick, which has grown\r\nout of these occurrences and is likewise herewith communicated, the\r\nformer is requested to recall the armed party advanced into the disputed\r\nterritory for the arrest of trespassers, and is informed that a strong\r\nbody of British troops is to be held in readiness to support and protect\r\nthe authority and subjects of Great Britain in said territory. In answer\r\nto that request the provincial governor is informed of the determination\r\nof the State of Maine to support the land agent and his party in the\r\nperformance of their duty, and the same determination, for the execution\r\nof which provision is made by a resolve of the State legislature, is\r\ncommunicated by the governor to the General Government.\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant-governor of New Brunswick, in calling upon the governor\r\nof Maine for the recall of the land agent and his party from the\r\ndisputed territory, and the British minister, in making a similar demand\r\nupon the Government of the United States, proceed upon the assumption\r\nthat an agreement exists between the two nations conceding to Great\r\nBritain, until the final settlement of the boundary question, exclusive\r\npossession of and jurisdiction over the territory in dispute. The\r\nimportant bearing which such an agreement, if it existed, would have\r\nupon the condition and interests of the parties, and the influence it\r\nmight have upon the adjustment of the dispute, are too obvious to allow\r\nthe error upon which this assumption seems to rest to pass for a moment\r\nwithout correction. The answer of the Secretary of State to Mr. Fox's\r\nnote will show the ground taken by the Government of the United States\r\nupon this point. It is believed that all the correspondence which has\r\npassed between the two Governments upon this subject has already been\r\ncommunicated to Congress and is now on their files. An abstract of\r\nit, however, hastily prepared, accompanies this communication. It is\r\npossible that in thus abridging a voluminous correspondence, commencing\r\nin 1825 and continuing to a very recent period, a portion may have been\r\naccidentally overlooked; but it is believed that nothing has taken\r\nplace which would materially change the aspect of the question as\r\ntherein presented. Instead of sustaining the assumption of the British\r\nfunctionaries, that correspondence disproves the existence of any such\r\nagreement. It shows that the two Governments have differed not only in\r\nregard to the main question of title to the territory in dispute, but\r\nwith reference also to the right of jurisdiction and the fact of the\r\nactual exercise of it in different portions thereof.\r\n\r\nAlways aiming at an amicable adjustment of the dispute, both parties\r\nhave entertained and repeatedly urged upon each other a desire that each\r\nshould exercise its rights, whatever it considered them to be, in such\r\na manner as to avoid collision and allay to the greatest practicable\r\nextent the excitement likely to grow out of the controversy. It was in\r\npursuance of such an understanding that Maine and Massachusetts, upon\r\nthe remonstrance of Great Britain, desisted from making sales of lands,\r\nand the General Government from the construction of a projected military\r\nroad in a portion of the territory of which they claimed to have enjoyed\r\nthe exclusive possession; and that Great Britain on her part, in\r\ndeference to a similar remonstrance from the United States, suspended\r\nthe issue of licenses to cut timber in the territory in controversy and\r\nalso the survey and location of a railroad through a section of country\r\nover which she also claimed to have exercised exclusive jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nThe State of Maine had a right to arrest the depredations complained of.\r\nIt belonged to her to judge of the exigency of the occasion calling for\r\nher interference, and it is presumed that had the lieutenant-governor of\r\nNew Brunswick been correctly advised of the nature of the proceedings\r\nof the State of Maine he would not have regarded the transaction as\r\nrequiring on his part any resort to force. Each party claiming a right\r\nto the territory, and hence to the exclusive jurisdiction over it, it is\r\nmanifest that to prevent the destruction of the timber by trespassers,\r\nacting against the authority of both, and at the same time avoid\r\nforcible collision between the contiguous governments during the\r\npendency of negotiations concerning the title, resort must be had to the\r\nmutual exercise of jurisdiction in such extreme cases or to an amicable\r\nand temporary arrangement as to the limits within which it should be\r\nexercised by each party. The understanding supposed to exist between the\r\nUnited States and Great Britain has been found heretofore sufficient\r\nfor that purpose, and I believe will prove so hereafter if the parties\r\non the frontier directly interested in the question are respectively\r\ngoverned by a just spirit of conciliation and forbearance. If it shall\r\nbe found, as there is now reason to apprehend, that there is, in the\r\nmodes of construing that understanding by the two Governments, a\r\ndifference not to be reconciled, I shall not hesitate to propose to\r\nHer Britannic Majesty's Government a distinct arrangement for the\r\ntemporary and mutual exercise of jurisdiction by means of which similar\r\ndifficulties may in future be prevented.\r\n\r\nBut between an effort on the part of Maine to preserve the property in\r\ndispute from destruction by intruders and a military occupation by that\r\nState of the territory with a view to hold it by force while the\r\nsettlement is a subject of negotiation between the two Governments there\r\nis an essential difference, as well in respect to the position of the\r\nState as to the duties of the General Government. In a letter addressed\r\nby the Secretary of State to the governor of Maine on the 1st of March\r\nlast, giving a detailed statement of the steps which had been taken by\r\nthe Federal Government to bring the controversy to a termination, and\r\ndesigned to apprise the governor of that State of the views of the\r\nFederal Executive in respect to the future, it was stated that while the\r\nobligations of the Federal Government to do all in its power to effect\r\nthe settlement of the boundary question were fully recognized, it had,\r\nin the event of being unable to do so specifically by mutual consent,\r\nno other means to accomplish that object amicably than by another\r\narbitration, or by a commission, with an umpire, in the nature of an\r\narbitration; and that in the event of all other measures failing the\r\nPresident would feel it his duty to submit another proposition to the\r\nGovernment of Great Britain to refer the decision of the question to a\r\nthird power. These are still my views upon the subject, and until this\r\nstep shall have been taken I can not think it proper to invoke the\r\nattention of Congress to other than amicable means for the settlement\r\nof the controversy, or to cause the military power of the Federal\r\nGovernment to be brought in aid of the State of Maine in any attempt\r\nto effect that object by a resort to force.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if the authorities of New Brunswick should attempt\r\nto enforce the claim of exclusive jurisdiction set up by them by means\r\nof a military occupation on their part of the disputed territory,\r\nI shall feel myself bound to consider the contingency provided by the\r\nConstitution as having occurred, on the happening of which a State\r\nhas the right to call for the aid of the Federal Government to repel\r\ninvasion.\r\n\r\nI have expressed to the British minister near this Government a\r\nconfident expectation that the agents of the State of Maine, who have\r\nbeen arrested under an obvious misapprehension of the object of their\r\nmission, will be promptly released, and to the governor of Maine that a\r\nsimilar course will be pursued in regard to the agents of the Province\r\nof New Brunswick. I have also recommended that any militia that may have\r\nbeen brought together by the State of Maine from an apprehension of a\r\ncollision with the government or people of the British Province will be\r\nvoluntarily and peaceably disbanded.\r\n\r\nI can not allow myself to doubt that the results anticipated from\r\nthese representations will be seasonably realized. The parties more\r\nimmediately interested can not but perceive that an appeal to arms\r\nunder existing circumstances will not only prove fatal to their present\r\ninterests, but would postpone, if not defeat, the attainment of the main\r\nobjects which they have in view. The very incidents which have recently\r\noccurred will necessarily awaken the Governments to the importance\r\nof promptly adjusting a dispute by which it is now made manifest that\r\nthe peace of the two nations is daily and imminently endangered. This\r\nexpectation is further warranted by the general forbearance which has\r\nhitherto characterized the conduct of the Government and people on both\r\nsides of the line. In the uniform patriotism of Maine, her attachment to\r\nthe Union, her respect for the wishes of the people of her sister States\r\n(of whose interest in her welfare she can not be unconscious), and in\r\nthe solicitude felt by the country at large for the preservation of\r\npeace with our neighbors, we have a strong guaranty that she will not\r\ndisregard the request that has been made of her.\r\n\r\nAs, however, the session of Congress is about to terminate and the\r\nagency of the Executive may become necessary during the recess, it\r\nis important that the attention of the Legislature should be drawn to\r\nthe consideration of such measures as may be calculated to obviate the\r\nnecessity of a call for an extra session. With that view I have thought\r\nit my duty to lay the whole matter before you and to invite such action\r\nthereon as you may think the occasion requires.\r\n\r\nM.

VAN BUREN,\r\n\r\n_President United States_.\r\n\r\nSIR: I have the honor to inclose herewith copies of letter from the\r\nlieutenant-governor of New Brunswick, under date of February 18, with my\r\nreply thereto; letter from the solicitor-general of the Province of New\r\nBrunswick to the Hon. Charles Jarvis, temporary land agent, under date\r\nof the 17th instant, with Mr. Jarvis's reply; parole of honor given by\r\nMessrs. McIntire, Cushman, Bartlett, and Webster, dated 18th February;\r\nmy message to the legislature of the 21st instant.\r\n\r\nThese papers will give Your Excellency all the additional information\r\nof any importance not heretofore communicated that has been received\r\nin relation to the state of affairs upon our eastern frontier. I can\r\nnot but persuade myself that Your Excellency will see that an attack\r\nupon the citizens of this State by a British armed force is in all\r\nhuman probability inevitable, and that the interposition of the General\r\nGovernment at this momentous crisis should be promptly afforded.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with high respect, Your Excellency's obedient\r\nservant,\r\n\r\nJOHN FAIRFIELD,\r\n\r\n_Governor of Maine_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT HOUSE,\r\n\r\n_Frederickton, New Brunswick, February 18, 1839_.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency the GOVERNOR OF MAINE.\r\n\r\nSIR: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt, by the hands of\r\nHon. Mr. Rogers, of your excellency's letter of the 15th instant.\r\nMr. McIntire and the gentlemen with him have been subjected to an\r\nexamination before Her Majesty's attorney-general of this Province, who\r\nhas reported to me that the offense of which they stand charged is one\r\nrather against the law of nations and of treaties than against those of\r\nthis Province. They must accordingly be regarded as \"state offenders.\"\r\nIn this view, their disposal rests exclusively with Her Majesty's\r\nGovernment, to which I shall accordingly report the case. In the\r\nmeantime I have had pleasure in directing that they shall immediately be\r\nallowed to return to the State of Maine upon pledging their parole of\r\nhonor to present themselves to the Government of this Province whenever\r\nHer Majesty's decision may be received, or when required to do so. The\r\nhigh respectability of their characters and situations and my desire to\r\nact in all matters relating to the disputed territory in such a manner\r\nas may evince the utmost forbearance consistent with the fulfillment of\r\nmy instructions have influenced me in my conduct toward these gentlemen;\r\nbut it is necessary that I should upon this occasion distinctly state\r\nto your excellency--\r\n\r\nFirst. That if it be the desire of the State of Maine that the\r\nfriendly relations subsisting between Great Britain and the United\r\nStates should not be disturbed, it is indispensable that the armed force\r\nfrom that State now understood to be within the territory in dispute\r\nbe immediately withdrawn, as otherwise I have no alternative but to\r\ntake military occupation of that territory, with a view to protect Her\r\nMajesty's subjects and to support the civil authorities in apprehending\r\nall persons claiming to exercise jurisdiction within it.\r\n\r\nSecond. That it is my duty to require that all persons subjects of Her\r\nMajesty who may have been arrested in the commission of acts of trespass\r\nwithin the disputed territory be given up to the tribunals of this\r\nProvince, there to be proceeded against according to law.\r\n\r\nThird. That in the event of the rumor which has just reached me relative\r\nto the arrest, detention, or interruption of James Maclauchlan, esq.,\r\nthe warden of the disputed territory, being correct, that that officer\r\nbe enlarged and the grounds of his detention explained.\r\n\r\nMr. Rogers takes charge of this letter, of which a duplicate will be\r\nplaced in the hands of the Hon. Mr. McIntire, with both of whom I have\r\nconversed and communicated to them my views in regard to the actual\r\nposition in which I shall be placed and the measures which will be\r\nforced upon me if the several demands contained in this letter be not\r\ncomplied with; and I have reason to believe that Mr. McIntire leaves me\r\nfully impressed with the anxious desire which I feel to be spared the\r\nnecessity of acting as the letter of my instructions would both warrant\r\nand prescribe.\r\n\r\nWith regard to trespasses upon the lands of the disputed territory,\r\nI beg to assure you that the extent to which those trespasses appear\r\nto have been carried, as brought to my knowledge by recent occurrences,\r\nwill lead me to adopt without any delay the strongest and most effectual\r\nmeasures which may be in my power for putting a stop to and preventing\r\nthe recurrence of such trespasses.\r\n\r\nWith high respect, I have the honor to be, your excellency's most\r\nobedient servant,\r\n\r\nJ. HARVEY,\r\n\r\n_Major-General, Lieutenant-Governor_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT,\r\n\r\n_Augusta, February 21, 1839_.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency SIR JOHN HARVEY,\r\n\r\n_Lieutenant-Governor New Brunswick_.\r\n\r\nSIR: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your excellency's\r\ncommunication of the 18th instant, by the hand of Colonel J.P. Rogers.\r\n\r\nTo your demand for the discharge of the persons arrested by the\r\nauthorities of this State for being engaged in acts of trespass upon the\r\npublic lands of this State I have to say that the persons named are now\r\nin the _custody of the law_. With that custody I have neither the\r\ndisposition nor the authority to interfere.\r\n\r\nIn regard to James Maclauchlan, esq., provincial land agent, and Mr.\r\nTibbets, his assistant, I have advised that they be released upon the\r\n_same terms_ upon which the Hon. Rufus McIntire and his assistants were\r\nreleased, to wit, upon their _parole of honor_ to return to Bangor\r\nwhenever they should be thereto required by the executive government of\r\nthis State, to answer to any charges that may be brought against them\r\nfor their acts and proceedings upon what your excellency is pleased to\r\ncall \"the disputed territory.\"\r\n\r\nFor a reply to the remainder of your excellency's communication I must\r\nrefer you to my letter of the 18th instant, which you will receive by\r\nthe hand of R. English, esq.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with high respect, your excellency's obedient\r\nservant,\r\n\r\nJOHN FAIRFIELD,\r\n\r\n_Governor of Maine_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAT THE MOUTH OF THE ARESTOOK, RIVER ST. JOHN,\r\n\r\n_Province of New Brunswick, February 17, 1839_.\r\n\r\nThe OFFICER COMMANDING THE ARMED FORCE ON THE DISPUTED TERRITORY.\r\n\r\nSIR: I am directed by His Excellency Major-General Sir John Harvey,\r\nlieutenant-governor and commander in chief of this Province, to express\r\nto you his great surprise at the very extraordinary occurrence of an\r\narmed force of the description now with you having entered upon the\r\ndisputed territory (so called) and attempted to exercise a jurisdiction\r\nthere foreign to the British Government, seizing upon and maltreating\r\nBritish subjects and retaining many of them prisoners without having in\r\nthe first instance given any notice or made any communication whatever\r\nto the government authorities of this Province of such your intention,\r\nor the causes which have led to these acts of aggression. If you are\r\nacting under any authority from your own government, the proceedings are\r\nstill more unjustifiable, being in direct defiance and breach of the\r\nexisting treaties between the Central Government of the United States\r\nand England. If you have not any such authority, you and those with you\r\nhave placed yourselves in a situation to be treated by both Governments\r\nas persons rebelling against the laws of either country. But be that as\r\nit may, I am directed by his excellency to give you notice that unless\r\nyou immediately remove with the force you have with you from any part of\r\nthe disputed territory (so called) and discharge all British subjects\r\nwhom you have taken prisoners and at once cease attempting to exercise\r\nany authority in the said territory not authorized by the British\r\nGovernment every person of your party that can be found or laid hold of\r\nwill be taken by the British authorities in this Province and detained\r\nas prisoners to answer for this offense, as his excellency is expressly\r\ncommanded by his Sovereign to hold this territory inviolate and to\r\ndefend it from any foreign aggression whatever until the two Governments\r\nhave determined the question of to whom it shall belong; and to enable\r\nhim to carry these commands into full effect, a large military force is\r\nnow assembling at this place, part of which has already arrived, and\r\nwill be shortly completed to any extent that the service may require.\r\nIn doing this his excellency is very desirous to avoid any collision\r\nbetween Her Majesty's troops and any of the citizens of the United\r\nStates that might lead to bloodshed, and if you remove from the\r\nterritory peaceably and quietly without further opposition such\r\ncollision will be avoided, as in that case his excellency will not think\r\nit necessary to move the British troops farther; but if you do not he\r\nwill, in the execution of the commands of the British Government, find\r\nit necessary to take military possession of the territory in order to\r\ndefend it from such innovation; and the consequences must be upon your\r\nown heads or upon the authority, if any, under which you act. The three\r\ngentlemen who were with you, and were taken prisoners by some of our\r\npeople, have been forwarded on to Frederickton by the magistrates of the\r\ncountry and will be detained (as all persons heretofore have been who\r\non former occasions were found endeavoring to set up or exercise any\r\nforeign jurisdiction or authority in the territory in question). They\r\nwill, however, be well treated and every necessary attention paid to\r\ntheir comfort; but I have no doubt they will be detained as prisoners,\r\nto be disposed of as may hereafter be directed by the British\r\nGovernment. The warden of the disputed territory, Mr. Maclauchlan, went\r\nout, I understood, a few days since to explain all this to you; but\r\nhe not having returned we are led to suppose you have still further\r\nviolated the laws and treaties of the two nations by detaining him, who\r\nwas a mere messenger of communication, together with Mr. Tibbets, the\r\nperson who was employed to convey him. But as Mr. Maclauchlan was an\r\naccredited officer, acknowledged by the American Government as well as\r\nthe British, and appointed for the very purpose of looking after this\r\nterritory, I trust you will on reflection see the great impropriety and\r\nrisk you run, even with your own government, by detaining him or his\r\nattendant, Mr. Tibbets, any longer.\r\n\r\nI shall await at this place to receive your answer to this.\r\n\r\nI am, sir, your most obedient, humble servant,\r\n\r\nGEO.

FRED. STREET, Esq.,\r\n\r\n_Solicitor-General of Province New Brunswick_.\r\n\r\nSIR: Your communication of the 17th instant has been this moment\r\nreceived. The solicitor-general of the Provinces must have been\r\nmisinformed as to the place where the force under my direction is now\r\nlocated, or he would have been spared the impropriety of addressing such\r\na communication to me, a citizen of the State of Maine, one of the North\r\nAmerican Confederacy of United States.\r\n\r\nIt is also to be hoped, for the honor of the British Empire, that when\r\nMajor-General Sir John Harvey, lieutenant-governor and commander in\r\nchief of the Province of New Brunswick, is made acquainted with the\r\nplace where the Hon. Rufus McIntire, land agent of the State of Maine,\r\nand the two other gentlemen with him were forcibly arrested by a lawless\r\nmob, that he will direct their immediate discharge and bring the\r\noffenders to justice.\r\n\r\nThe officer to whom you allude and the person in company with him were\r\narrested for serving a precept on a citizen of Maine. He was sent on\r\nimmediately to Augusta, the seat of government, to be dealt with by the\r\nauthorities of the State. Their persons are not, therefore, in my power,\r\nand application for their discharge must be made to the government of\r\nthe State.\r\n\r\nIf, however, I have been in error as to your being under a mistake as\r\nto the place where I am now stationed, on land which was run out into\r\ntownships by the State of Massachusetts and covered by grants from\r\nthat State before Maine was separated from Massachusetts, and which\r\nhas therefore been under the jurisdiction of Maine since she has taken\r\nher rank among the independent States of the North American Union,\r\ntherefore, as a citizen of Maine, in official capacity, I have but one\r\nanswer to return to the threat conveyed: I am here under the direction\r\nof the executive of the State, and must remain until otherwise ordered\r\nby the only authority recognized by me; and deeply as I should regret a\r\nconflict between our respective countries, I shall consider the approach\r\nto my station by an armed force as an act of hostility, which will be\r\nmet by me to the best of my ability.\r\n\r\nI am, sir, your most obedient servant,\r\n\r\nCHARLES JARVIS,\r\n\r\n_Land Agent_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFREDERICKTON, NEW BRUNSWICK, _February 18, 1839_.\r\n\r\nHon. RUFUS McINTIRE, GUSTAVUS G. CUSHMAN, THOMAS BARTLETT, and EBENEZER\r\nWEBSTER, Esqs.:\r\n\r\nWhereas the offense wherewith you stand charged has been pronounced\r\nby the law officers of this Province as one rather against the law\r\nof nations and of treaties than against the municipal laws of this\r\ncountry, and as such must be referred for the decision of Her Majesty's\r\nGovernment, you are hereby required to pledge your parole of honor to\r\npresent yourselves at Frederickton, in this Province of New Brunswick,\r\nwhenever such decision shall be communicated, or you shall be otherwise\r\nrequired by or on the part of this government; and for this purpose you\r\nshall make known the place or places to which such requisition shall be\r\nsent.\r\n\r\nJ. HARVEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 18, 1839.\r\n\r\nWe have no hesitation in giving, and hereby do give, the parole of honor\r\nabove referred to.\r\n\r\nWitness:\r\n\r\nW. EARL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOUNCIL CHAMBER, _February 21, 1839_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nUnder the order of the House of Representatives of the 19th instant,\r\nI herewith, lay before you certain correspondence since had with the\r\nlieutenant-governor of New Brunswick, and the correspondence between\r\nGeo. Frederick Street, esq., solicitor-general for the Province of New\r\nBrunswick, and Charles Jarvis, esq., provisional land agent of this\r\nState.\r\n\r\nThe reply of Mr. Jarvis to the inadmissible and preposterous claims and\r\npretensions of Her Majesty's solicitor-general for the Province of New\r\nBrunswick must, I think, command the unqualified approbation of everyone\r\nhaving a just regard for the honor of his State. It is in the true\r\nspirit, and I have every reason to believe that the same spirit animates\r\nthe whole body of our citizens. While it prevails, though success will\r\nbe deserved, defeat can bring no disgrace.\r\n\r\nYou will see by the accompanying papers (and I take great pleasure in\r\ncommunicating the fact) that Mr. McIntire and his assistants have been\r\nreleased. It was, however, upon their parole of honor to return when\r\nthereto required by the government of that Province. Immediately\r\nupon the receipt of this information I advised the release of James\r\nMaclauchlan, esq., provincial land agent, and his assistant, _upon\r\nthe same terms_.\r\n\r\nSince my last communication the land agent's forces at the Aroostook\r\nhave been reenforced by about 600 good and effective men, making the\r\nwhole force now about 750.\r\n\r\nI have a letter from Mr. Jarvis dated the 19th, before the reenforcement\r\nhad arrived, and when his company consisted of only 100 men. He says he\r\nfound the men in good spirits and that they had been active in making\r\ntemporary but most effectual defenses of logs, etc.\r\n\r\nAfter describing his defenses, he says: \"By to-morrow noon a force\r\nof 100 men would make good our position against 500. _Retreating,\r\ntherefore, is out of the question_. We shall make good our stand against\r\nany force that we can reasonably expect would be brought against us.\"\r\nHe says further: \"I take pleasure in saying to you that a finer looking\r\nset of men I never saw than those now with me, and that the honor of our\r\nState, so far as they are concerned, is in safe-keeping.\"\r\n\r\nThe draft of 1,000 men from the third division has been made with great\r\ndispatch. The troops, I understand, arrived promptly at the place of\r\nrendezvous at the time appointed in good spirits and anxious for the\r\norder to march to the frontier. The detachment from this second division\r\nwill be ordered to march at the earliest convenient day--probably on\r\nMonday next. Other military movements will be made, which it is\r\nunnecessary to communicate to you at this time.\r\n\r\nThe mission of Colonel Rogers to the lieutenant-governor of New\r\nBrunswick has resulted successfully so far as relates to the release of\r\nthe land agent and his assistants, and has been conducted in a manner\r\nhighly satisfactory.\r\n\r\nJOHN FAIRFIELD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Memorandum.]\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 27, 1839_.\r\n\r\nHer Majesty's authorities consider it to have been understood and agreed\r\nupon by the two Governments that the territory in dispute between Great\r\nBritain and the United States on the northeastern frontier should remain\r\nexclusively under British jurisdiction until the final settlement of the\r\nboundary question.\r\n\r\nThe United States Government have not understood the above agreement\r\nin the same sense, but consider, on the contrary, that there has been\r\nno agreement whatever for the exercise by Great Britain of exclusive\r\njurisdiction over the disputed territory or any portion thereof, but\r\na mutual understanding that pending the negotiation the jurisdiction\r\nthen exercised by either party over small portions of the territory\r\nin dispute should not be enlarged, but be continued merely for the\r\npreservation of local tranquillity and the public property, both\r\nforbearing, as far as practicable, to exert any authority, and when\r\nany should be exercised by either placing upon the conduct of each\r\nother the most favorable construction.\r\n\r\nA complete understanding upon the question thus placed at issue of\r\npresent jurisdiction can only be arrived at by friendly discussion\r\nbetween the Governments of the United States and Great Britain, and as\r\nit is confidently hoped that there will be an early settlement of the\r\ngeneral question, this subordinate point of difference can be of but\r\nlittle moment.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the government of the Province of New Brunswick and the\r\ngovernment of the State of Maine will act as follows: Her Majesty's\r\nofficers will not seek to expel by military force the armed party which\r\nhas been sent by Maine into the district bordering on the Restook River,\r\nbut the government of Maine will voluntarily and without needless delay\r\nwithdraw beyond the bounds of the disputed territory any armed force\r\nnow within them; and if future necessity shall arise for dispersing\r\nnotorious trespassers or protecting public property from depredation\r\nby armed force, the operation shall be conducted by concert, jointly or\r\nseparately, according to agreement between the governments of Maine and\r\nNew Brunswick.\r\n\r\nThe civil officers in the service, respectively, of New Brunswick and\r\nMaine who have been taken into custody by the opposite parties shall be\r\nreleased.\r\n\r\nNothing in this memorandum shall be construed to fortify or to weaken\r\nin any respect whatever the claim of either party to the ultimate\r\npossession of the disputed territory.\r\n\r\nThe minister plenipotentiary of Her Britannic Majesty having no specific\r\nauthority to make any arrangement on this subject, the undersigned can\r\nonly recommend, as they now earnestly do, to the governments of New\r\nBrunswick and Maine to regulate their future proceedings according to\r\nthe terms hereinbefore set forth until the final settlement of the\r\nterritorial dispute or until the Governments of the United States and\r\nGreat Britain shall come to some definite conclusion on the subordinate\r\npoint upon which they are now at issue.\r\n\r\nJOHN FORSYTH,\r\n\r\n_Secretary of State of the United States of North America_.\r\n\r\nH.S.

The ravages of fire and\r\ndisease have painfully afflicted otherwise flourishing portions of our\r\ncountry, and serious embarrassments yet derange the trade of many of our\r\ncities. But notwithstanding these adverse circumstances, that general\r\nprosperity which has been heretofore so bountifully bestowed upon us\r\nby the Author of All Good still continues to call for our warmest\r\ngratitude. Especially have we reason to rejoice in the exuberant\r\nharvests which have lavishly recompensed well-directed industry and\r\ngiven to it that sure reward which is vainly sought in visionary\r\nspeculations. I can not, indeed, view without peculiar satisfaction the\r\nevidences afforded by the past season of the benefits that spring from\r\nthe steady devotion of the husbandman to his honorable pursuit. No\r\nmeans of individual comfort is more certain and no source of national\r\nprosperity is so sure. Nothing can compensate a people for a dependence\r\nupon others for the bread they eat, and that cheerful abundance on which\r\nthe happiness of everyone so much depends is to be looked for nowhere\r\nwith such sure reliance as in the industry of the agriculturist and the\r\nbounties of the earth.\r\n\r\nWith foreign countries our relations exhibit the same favorable aspect\r\nwhich was presented in my last annual message, and afford continued\r\nproof of the wisdom of the pacific, just, and forbearing policy adopted\r\nby the first Administration of the Federal Government and pursued by its\r\nsuccessors. The extraordinary powers vested in me by an act of Congress\r\nfor the defense of the country in an emergency, considered so far\r\nprobable as to require that the Executive should possess ample means to\r\nmeet it, have not been exerted. They have therefore been attended with\r\nno other result than to increase, by the confidence thus reposed in\r\nme, my obligations to maintain with religious exactness the cardinal\r\nprinciples that govern our intercourse with other nations. Happily,\r\nin our pending questions with Great Britain, out of which this unusual\r\ngrant of authority arose, nothing has occurred to require its exertion,\r\nand as it is about to return to the Legislature I trust that no future\r\nnecessity may call for its exercise by them or its delegation to another\r\nDepartment of the Government.\r\n\r\nFor the settlement of our northeastern boundary the proposition promised\r\nby Great Britain for a commission of exploration and survey has been\r\nreceived, and a counter project, including also a provision for the\r\ncertain and final adjustment of the limits in dispute, is now before the\r\nBritish Government for its consideration. A just regard to the delicate\r\nstate of this question and a proper respect for the natural impatience\r\nof the State of Maine, not less than a conviction that the negotiation\r\nhas been already protracted longer than is prudent on the part of either\r\nGovernment, have led me to believe that the present favorable moment\r\nshould on no account be suffered to pass without putting the question\r\nforever at rest. I feel confident that the Government of Her Britannic\r\nMajesty will take the same view of this subject, as I am persuaded it\r\nis governed by desires equally strong and sincere for the amicable\r\ntermination of the controversy.\r\n\r\nTo the intrinsic difficulties of questions of boundary lines, especially\r\nthose described in regions unoccupied and but partially known, is to\r\nbe added in our country the embarrassment necessarily arising out of\r\nour Constitution by which the General Government is made the organ of\r\nnegotiating and deciding upon the particular interests of the States\r\non whose frontiers these lines are to be traced. To avoid another\r\ncontroversy in which a State government might rightfully claim to have\r\nher wishes consulted previously to the conclusion of conventional\r\narrangements concerning her rights of jurisdiction or territory, I have\r\nthought it necessary to call the attention of the Government of Great\r\nBritain to another portion of our conterminous dominion of which the\r\ndivision still remains to be adjusted. I refer to the line from the\r\nentrance of Lake Superior to the most northwestern point of the Lake of\r\nthe Woods, stipulations for the settlement of which are to be found in\r\nthe seventh article of the treaty of Ghent. The commissioners appointed\r\nunder that article by the two Governments having differed in their\r\nopinions, made separate reports, according to its stipulations, upon the\r\npoints of disagreement, and these differences are now to be submitted\r\nto the arbitration of some friendly sovereign or state. The disputed\r\npoints should be settled and the line designated before the Territorial\r\ngovernment of which it is one of the boundaries takes its place in the\r\nUnion as a State, and I rely upon the cordial cooperation of the British\r\nGovernment to effect that object.\r\n\r\nThere is every reason to believe that disturbances like those which\r\nlately agitated the neighboring British Provinces will not again prove\r\nthe sources of border contentions or interpose obstacles to the\r\ncontinuance of that good understanding which it is the mutual interest\r\nof Great Britain and the United States to preserve and maintain.\r\n\r\nWithin the Provinces themselves tranquillity is restored, and on our\r\nfrontier that misguided sympathy in favor of what was presumed to be a\r\ngeneral effort in behalf of popular rights, and which in some instances\r\nmisled a few of our more inexperienced citizens, has subsided into a\r\nrational conviction strongly opposed to all intermeddling with the\r\ninternal affairs of our neighbors. The people of the United States feel,\r\nas it is hoped they always will, a warm solicitude for the success of\r\nall who are sincerely endeavoring to improve the political condition\r\nof mankind. This generous feeling they cherish toward the most distant\r\nnations, and it was natural, therefore, that it should be awakened\r\nwith more than common warmth in behalf of their immediate neighbors;\r\nbut it does not belong to their character as a community to seek the\r\ngratification of those feelings in acts which violate their duty as\r\ncitizens, endanger the peace of their country, and tend to bring upon\r\nit the stain of a violated faith toward foreign nations. If, zealous to\r\nconfer benefits on others, they appear for a moment to lose sight of the\r\npermanent obligations imposed upon them as citizens, they are seldom\r\nlong misled. From all the information I receive, confirmed to some\r\nextent by personal observation, I am satisfied that no one can now hope\r\nto engage in such enterprises without encountering public indignation,\r\nin addition to the severest penalties of the law.\r\n\r\nRecent information also leads me to hope that the emigrants from Her\r\nMajesty's Provinces who have sought refuge within our boundaries are\r\ndisposed to become peaceable residents and to abstain from all attempts\r\nto endanger the peace of that country which has afforded them an asylum.\r\nOn a review of the occurrences on both sides of the line it is\r\nsatisfactory to reflect that in almost every complaint against our\r\ncountry the offense may be traced to emigrants from the Provinces who\r\nhave sought refuge here. In the few instances in which they were aided\r\nby citizens of the United States the acts of these misguided men were\r\nnot only in direct contravention of the laws and well-known wishes of\r\ntheir own Government, but met with the decided disapprobation of the\r\npeople of the United States.\r\n\r\nI regret to state the appearance of a different spirit among Her\r\nMajesty's subjects in the Canadas. The sentiments of hostility to our\r\npeople and institutions which have been so frequently expressed there,\r\nand the disregard of our rights which has been manifested on some\r\noccasions, have, I am sorry to say, been applauded and encouraged by\r\nthe people, and even by some of the subordinate local authorities, of\r\nthe Provinces. The chief officers in Canada, fortunately, have not\r\nentertained the same feeling, and have probably prevented excesses that\r\nmust have been fatal to the peace of the two countries.\r\n\r\nI look forward anxiously to a period when all the transactions which\r\nhave grown out of this condition of our affairs, and which have been\r\nmade the subjects of complaint and remonstrance by the two Governments,\r\nrespectively, shall be fully examined, and the proper satisfaction given\r\nwhere it is due from either side.\r\n\r\nNothing has occurred to disturb the harmony of our intercourse with\r\nAustria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Naples, Portugal, Prussia, Russia,\r\nor Sweden. The internal state of Spain has sensibly improved, and a\r\nwell-grounded hope exists that the return of peace will restore to\r\nthe people of that country their former prosperity and enable the\r\nGovernment to fulfill all its obligations at home and abroad. The\r\nGovernment of Portugal, I have the satisfaction to state, has paid\r\nin full the eleventh and last installment due to our citizens for\r\nthe claims embraced in the settlement made with it on the 3d of\r\nMarch, 1837.\r\n\r\nI lay before you treaties of commerce negotiated with the Kings of\r\nSardinia and of the Netherlands, the ratifications of which have been\r\nexchanged since the adjournment of Congress. The liberal principles\r\nof these treaties will recommend them to your approbation. That with\r\nSardinia is the first treaty of commerce formed by that Kingdom, and\r\nit will, I trust, answer the expectations of the present Sovereign by\r\naiding the development of the resources of his country and stimulating\r\nthe enterprise of his people. That with the Netherlands happily\r\nterminates a long-existing subject of dispute and removes from our\r\nfuture commercial intercourse all apprehension of embarrassment.\r\nThe King of the Netherlands has also, in further illustration of\r\nhis character for justice and of his desire to remove every cause of\r\ndissatisfaction, made compensation for an American vessel captured in\r\n1800 by a French privateer, and carried into Curaçoa, where the proceeds\r\nwere appropriated to the use of the colony, then, and for a short time\r\nafter, under the dominion of Holland.\r\n\r\nThe death of the late Sultan has produced no alteration in our\r\nrelations with Turkey. Our newly appointed minister resident has reached\r\nConstantinople, and I have received assurances from the present ruler\r\nthat the obligations of our treaty and those of friendship will be\r\nfulfilled by himself in the same spirit that actuated his illustrious\r\nfather.\r\n\r\nI regret to be obliged to inform you that no convention for the\r\nsettlement of the claims of our citizens upon Mexico has yet been\r\nratified by the Government of that country. The first convention formed\r\nfor that purpose was not presented by the President of Mexico for the\r\napprobation of its Congress, from a belief that the King of Prussia,\r\nthe arbitrator in case of disagreement in the joint commission to be\r\nappointed by the United States and Mexico, would not consent to take\r\nupon himself that friendly office. Although not entirely satisfied with\r\nthe course pursued by Mexico, I felt no hesitation in receiving in the\r\nmost conciliatory spirit the explanation offered, and also cheerfully\r\nconsented to a new convention, in order to arrange the payments\r\nproposed to be made to our citizens in a manner which, while equally\r\njust to them, was deemed less onerous and inconvenient to the Mexican\r\nGovernment. Relying confidently upon the intentions of that Government,\r\nMr. Ellis was directed to repair to Mexico, and diplomatic intercourse\r\nhas been resumed between the two countries. The new convention has, he\r\ninforms us, been recently submitted by the President of that Republic\r\nto its Congress under circumstances which promise a speedy ratification,\r\na result which I can not allow myself to doubt.\r\n\r\nInstructions have been given to the commissioner of the United States\r\nunder our convention with Texas for the demarcation of the line which\r\nseparates us from that Republic. The commissioners of both Governments\r\nmet in New Orleans in August last. The joint commission was organized,\r\nand adjourned to convene at the same place on the 12th of October. It\r\nis presumed to be now in the performance of its duties.\r\n\r\nThe new Government of Texas has shown its desire to cultivate friendly\r\nrelations with us by a prompt reparation for injuries complained of in\r\nthe cases of two vessels of the United States.\r\n\r\nWith Central America a convention has been concluded for the renewal of\r\nits former treaty with the United States. This was not ratified before\r\nthe departure of our late chargé d'affaires from that country, and the\r\ncopy of it brought by him was not received before the adjournment of the\r\nSenate at the last session. In the meanwhile, the period limited for\r\nthe exchange of ratifications having expired, I deemed it expedient, in\r\nconsequence of the death of the chargé d'affaires, to send a special\r\nagent to Central America to close the affairs of our mission there and\r\nto arrange with the Government an extension of the time for the exchange\r\nof ratifications.\r\n\r\nThe commission created by the States which formerly composed the\r\nRepublic of Colombia for adjusting the claims against that Government\r\nhas by a very unexpected construction of the treaty under which it acts\r\ndecided that no provision was made for those claims of citizens of the\r\nUnited States which arose from captures by Colombian privateers and were\r\nadjudged against the claimants in the judicial tribunals. This decision\r\nwill compel the United States to apply to the several Governments\r\nformerly united for redress. With all these--New Granada, Venezuela,\r\nand Ecuador--a perfectly good understanding exists. Our treaty with\r\nVenezuela is faithfully carried into execution, and that country, in\r\nthe enjoyment of tranquillity, is gradually advancing in prosperity\r\nunder the guidance of its present distinguished President, General Paez.\r\nWith Ecuador a liberal commercial convention has lately been concluded,\r\nwhich will be transmitted to the Senate at an early day.\r\n\r\nWith the great American Empire of Brazil our relations continue\r\nunchanged, as does our friendly intercourse with the other Governments\r\nof South America--the Argentine Republic and the Republics of Uruguay,\r\nChili, Peru, and Bolivia. The dissolution of the Peru-Bolivian\r\nConfederation may occasion some temporary inconvenience to our citizens\r\nin that quarter, but the obligations on the new Governments which have\r\narisen out of that Confederation to observe its treaty stipulations will\r\nno doubt be soon understood, and it is presumed that no indisposition\r\nwill exist to fulfill those which it contracted with the United States.\r\n\r\nThe financial operations of the Government during the present year have,\r\nI am happy to say, been very successful. The difficulties under which\r\nthe Treasury Department has labored, from known defects in the existing\r\nlaws relative to the safe-keeping of the public moneys, aggravated by\r\nthe suspension of specie payments by several of the banks holding public\r\ndeposits or indebted to public officers for notes received in payment of\r\npublic dues, have been surmounted to a very gratifying extent. The large\r\ncurrent expenditures have been punctually met, and the faith of the\r\nGovernment in all its pecuniary concerns has been scrupulously\r\nmaintained.\r\n\r\nThe nineteen millions of Treasury notes authorized by the act of\r\nCongress of 1837, and the modifications thereof with a view to the\r\nindulgence of merchants on their duty bonds and of the deposit banks\r\nin the payment of public moneys held by them, have been so punctually\r\nredeemed as to leave less than the original ten millions outstanding at\r\nany one time, and the whole amount unredeemed now falls short of three\r\nmillions. Of these the chief portion is not due till next year, and\r\nthe whole would have been already extinguished could the Treasury have\r\nrealized the payments due to it from the banks. If those due from them\r\nduring the next year shall be punctually made, and if Congress shall\r\nkeep the appropriations within the estimates, there is every reason to\r\nbelieve that all the outstanding Treasury notes can be redeemed and the\r\nordinary expenses defrayed without imposing on the people any additional\r\nburden, either of loans or increased taxes.\r\n\r\nTo avoid this and to keep the expenditures within reasonable bounds is\r\na duty second only in importance to the preservation of our national\r\ncharacter and the protection of our citizens in their civil and\r\npolitical rights. The creation in time of peace of a debt likely to\r\nbecome permanent is an evil for which there is no equivalent. The\r\nrapidity with which many of the States are apparently approaching\r\nto this condition admonishes us of our own duties in a manner too\r\nimpressive to be disregarded. One, not the least important, is to keep\r\nthe Federal Government always in a condition to discharge with ease and\r\nvigor its highest functions should their exercise be required by any\r\nsudden conjuncture of public affairs--a condition to which we are always\r\nexposed and which may occur when it is least expected. To this end\r\nit is indispensable that its finances should be untrammeled and its\r\nresources as far as practicable unencumbered. No circumstance could\r\npresent greater obstacles to the accomplishment of these vitally\r\nimportant objects than the creation of an onerous national debt. Our\r\nown experience and also that of other nations have demonstrated the\r\nunavoidable and fearful rapidity with which a public debt is increased\r\nwhen the Government has once surrendered itself to the ruinous practice\r\nof supplying its supposed necessities by new loans. The struggle,\r\ntherefore, on our part to be successful must be made at the threshold.\r\nTo make our efforts effective, severe economy is necessary. This is the\r\nsurest provision for the national welfare, and it is at the same time\r\nthe best preservative of the principles on which our institutions rest.\r\nSimplicity and economy in the affairs of state have never failed to\r\nchasten and invigorate republican principles, while these have been\r\nas surely subverted by national prodigality, under whatever specious\r\npretexts it may have been introduced or fostered.\r\n\r\nThese considerations can not be lost upon a people who have never been\r\ninattentive to the effect of their policy upon the institutions they\r\nhave created for themselves, but at the present moment their force is\r\naugmented by the necessity which a decreasing revenue must impose. The\r\ncheck lately given to importations of articles subject to duties, the\r\nderangements in the operations of internal trade, and especially the\r\nreduction gradually taking place in our tariff of duties, all tend\r\nmaterially to lessen our receipts; indeed, it is probable that the\r\ndiminution resulting from the last cause alone will not fall short of\r\n$5,000,000 in the year 1842, as the final reduction of all duties to\r\n20 per cent then takes effect. The whole revenue then accruing from\r\nthe customs and from the sales of public lands, if not more, will\r\nundoubtedly be wanted to defray the necessary expenses of the Government\r\nunder the most prudent administration of its affairs. These are\r\ncircumstances that impose the necessity of rigid economy and require its\r\nprompt and constant exercise. With the Legislature rest the power and\r\nduty of so adjusting the public expenditure as to promote this end.\r\nBy the provisions of the Constitution it is only in consequence of\r\nappropriations made by law that money can be drawn from the Treasury.\r\nNo instance has occurred since the establishment of the Government in\r\nwhich the Executive, though a component part of the legislative power,\r\nhas interposed an objection to an appropriation bill on the sole ground\r\nof its extravagance. His duty in this respect has been considered\r\nfulfilled by requesting such appropriations only as the public service\r\nmay be reasonably expected to require. In the present earnest direction\r\nof the public mind toward this subject both the Executive and the\r\nLegislature have evidence of the strict responsibility to which they\r\nwill be held; and while I am conscious of my own anxious efforts to\r\nperform with fidelity this portion of my public functions, it is\r\na satisfaction to me to be able to count on a cordial cooperation\r\nfrom you.\r\n\r\nAt the time I entered upon my present duties our ordinary disbursements,\r\nwithout including those on account of the public debt, the Post-Office,\r\nand the trust funds in charge of the Government, had been largely\r\nincreased by appropriations for the removal of the Indians, for\r\nrepelling Indian hostilities, and for other less urgent expenses which\r\ngrew out of an overflowing Treasury. Independent of the redemption of\r\nthe public debt and trusts, the gross expenditures of seventeen and\r\neighteen millions in 1834 and 1835 had by these causes swelled to\r\ntwenty-nine millions in 1836, and the appropriations for 1837, made\r\npreviously to the 4th of March, caused the expenditure to rise to the\r\nvery large amount of thirty-three millions. We were enabled during the\r\nyear 1838, notwithstanding the continuance of our Indian embarrassments,\r\nsomewhat to reduce this amount, and that for the present year (1839)\r\nwill not in all probability exceed twenty-six millions, or six millions\r\nless than it was last year. With a determination, so far as depends\r\non me, to continue this reduction, I have directed the estimates for\r\n1840 to be subjected to the severest scrutiny and to be limited to the\r\nabsolute requirements of the public service. They will be found less\r\nthan the expenditures of 1839 by over $5,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe precautionary measures which will be recommended by the Secretary\r\nof the Treasury to protect faithfully the public credit under the\r\nfluctuations and contingencies to which our receipts and expenditures\r\nare exposed, and especially in a commercial crisis like the present,\r\nare commended to your early attention.\r\n\r\nOn a former occasion your attention was invited to various\r\nconsiderations in support of a preemption law in behalf of the settlers\r\non the public lands, and also of a law graduating the prices for such\r\nlands as had long been in the market unsold in consequence of their\r\ninferior quality. The execution of the act which was passed on the first\r\nsubject has been attended with the happiest consequences in quieting\r\ntitles and securing improvements to the industrious, and it has also\r\nto a very gratifying extent been exempt from the frauds which were\r\npracticed under previous preemption laws. It has at the same time, as\r\nwas anticipated, contributed liberally during the present year to the\r\nreceipts of the Treasury.\r\n\r\nThe passage of a graduation law, with the guards before recommended,\r\nwould also, I am persuaded, add considerably to the revenue for several\r\nyears, and prove in other respects just and beneficial.\r\n\r\nYour early consideration of the subject is therefore once more earnestly\r\nrequested.\r\n\r\nThe present condition of the defenses of our principal seaports and\r\nnavy-yards, as represented by the accompanying report of the Secretary\r\nof War, calls for the early and serious attention of Congress; and, as\r\nconnecting itself intimately with this subject, I can not recommend too\r\nstrongly to your consideration the plan submitted by that officer for\r\nthe organization of the militia of the United States.\r\n\r\nIn conformity with the expressed wishes of Congress, an attempt was\r\nmade in the spring to terminate the Florida war by negotiation. It is\r\nto be regretted that these humane intentions should have been frustrated\r\nand that the effort to bring these unhappy difficulties to a\r\nsatisfactory conclusion should have failed; but after entering into\r\nsolemn engagements with the commanding general, the Indians, without any\r\nprovocation, recommenced their acts of treachery and murder. The renewal\r\nof hostilities in that Territory renders it necessary that I should\r\nrecommend to your favorable consideration the plan which will be\r\nsubmitted to you by the Secretary of War, in order to enable that\r\nDepartment to conduct them to a successful issue.\r\n\r\nHaving had an opportunity of personally inspecting a portion of the\r\ntroops during the last summer, it gives me pleasure to bear testimony to\r\nthe success of the effort to improve their discipline by keeping them\r\ntogether in as large bodies as the nature of our service will permit.\r\nI recommend, therefore, that commodious and permanent barracks be\r\nconstructed at the several posts designated by the Secretary of War.\r\nNotwithstanding the high state of their discipline and excellent police,\r\nthe evils resulting to the service from the deficiency of company\r\nofficers were very apparent, and I recommend that the staff officers be\r\npermanently separated from the line.\r\n\r\nThe Navy has been usefully and honorably employed in protecting the\r\nrights and property of our citizens wherever the condition of affairs\r\nseemed to require its presence. With the exception of one instance,\r\nwhere an outrage, accompanied by murder, was committed on a vessel of\r\nthe United States while engaged in a lawful commerce, nothing is known\r\nto have occurred to impede or molest the enterprise of our citizens on\r\nthat element, where it is so signally displayed. On learning this daring\r\nact of piracy, Commodore Reed proceeded immediately to the spot, and\r\nreceiving no satisfaction, either in the surrender of the murderers or\r\nthe restoration of the plundered property, inflicted severe and merited\r\nchastisement on the barbarians.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen by the report of the Secretary of the Navy respecting\r\nthe disposition of our ships of war that it has been deemed necessary to\r\nstation a competent force on the coast of Africa to prevent a fraudulent\r\nuse of our flag by foreigners.\r\n\r\nRecent experience has shown that the provisions in our existing laws\r\nwhich relate to the sale and transfer of American vessels while abroad\r\nare extremely defective. Advantage has been taken of these defects\r\nto give to vessels wholly belonging to foreigners and navigating the\r\nocean an apparent American ownership. This character has been so well\r\nsimulated as to afford them comparative security in prosecuting the\r\nslave trade--a traffic emphatically denounced in our statutes, regarded\r\nwith abhorrence by our citizens, and of which the effectual suppression\r\nis nowhere more sincerely desired than in the United States. These\r\ncircumstances make it proper to recommend to your early attention a\r\ncareful revision of these laws, so that without impeding the freedom\r\nand facilities of our navigation or impairing an important branch of\r\nour industry connected with it the integrity and honor of our flag may\r\nbe carefully preserved. Information derived from our consul at Havana\r\nshowing the necessity of this was communicated to a committee of the\r\nSenate near the close of the last session, but too late, as it appeared,\r\nto be acted upon. It will be brought to your notice by the proper\r\nDepartment, with additional communications from other sources.\r\n\r\nThe latest accounts from the exploring expedition represent it as\r\nproceeding successfully in its objects and promising results no less\r\nuseful to trade and navigation than to science.\r\n\r\nThe extent of post-roads covered by mail service on the 1st of July last\r\nwas about 133,999 miles and the rate of annual transportation upon them\r\n34,496,878 miles. The number of post-offices on that day was 12,780 and\r\non the 30th ultimo 13,028.\r\n\r\nThe revenue of the Post-Office Department for the year ending with the\r\n30th of June last was $4,476,638, exhibiting an increase over the\r\npreceding year of $241,560. The engagements and liabilities of the\r\nDepartment for the same period are $4,624,117.\r\n\r\nThe excess of liabilities over the revenue for the last two years\r\nhas been met out of the surplus which had previously accumulated.\r\nThe cash on hand on the 30th ultimo was about $206,701.95, and the\r\ncurrent income of the Department varies very little from the rate of\r\ncurrent expenditures. Most of the service suspended last year has been\r\nrestored, and most of the new routes established by the act of 7th July,\r\n1838, have been set in operation, at an annual cost of $136,963.\r\nNotwithstanding the pecuniary difficulties of the country, the revenue\r\nof the Department appears to be increasing, and unless it shall be\r\nseriously checked by the recent suspension of payment by so many of the\r\nbanks it will be able not only to maintain the present mail service,\r\nbut in a short time to extend it. It is gratifying to witness the\r\npromptitude and fidelity with which the agents of this Department\r\nin general perform their public duties.\r\n\r\nSome difficulties have arisen in relation to contracts for the\r\ntransportation of the mails by railroad and steamboat companies. It\r\nappears that the maximum of compensation provided by Congress for the\r\ntransportation of the mails upon railroads is not sufficient to induce\r\nsome of the companies to convey them at such hours as are required for\r\nthe accommodation of the public. It is one of the most important duties\r\nof the General Government to provide and maintain for the use of the\r\npeople of the States the best practicable mail establishment. To arrive\r\nat that end it is indispensable that the Post-Office Department shall\r\nbe enabled to control the hours at which the mails shall be carried\r\nover railroads, as it now does over all other roads. Should serious\r\ninconveniences arise from the inadequacy of the compensation now\r\nprovided by law, or from unreasonable demands by any of the railroad\r\ncompanies, the subject is of such general importance as to require\r\nthe prompt attention of Congress.\r\n\r\nIn relation to steamboat lines, the most efficient remedy is obvious\r\nand has been suggested by the Postmaster-General. The War and Navy\r\nDepartments already employ steamboats in their service; and although\r\nit is by no means desirable that the Government should undertake the\r\ntransportation of passengers or freight as a business, there can be no\r\nreasonable objection to running boats, temporarily, whenever it may be\r\nnecessary to put down attempts at extortion, to be discontinued as soon\r\nas reasonable contracts can be obtained.\r\n\r\nThe suggestions of the Postmaster-General relative to the inadequacy\r\nof the legal allowance to witnesses in cases of prosecutions for mail\r\ndepredations merit your serious consideration. The safety of the mails\r\nrequires that such prosecutions shall be efficient, and justice to the\r\ncitizen whose time is required to be given to the public demands not\r\nonly that his expenses shall be paid, but that he shall receive a\r\nreasonable compensation.\r\n\r\nThe reports from the War, Navy, and Post-Office Departments will\r\naccompany this communication, and one from the Treasury Department\r\nwill be presented to Congress in a few days.\r\n\r\nFor various details in respect to the matters in charge of these\r\nDepartments I would refer you to those important documents, satisfied\r\nthat you will find in them many valuable suggestions which will be found\r\nwell deserving the attention of the Legislature.\r\n\r\nFrom a report made in December of last year by the Secretary of State\r\nto the Senate, showing the trial docket of each of the circuit courts\r\nand the number of miles each judge has to travel in the performance of\r\nhis duties, a great inequality appears in the amount of labor assigned\r\nto each judge. The number of terms to be held in each of the courts\r\ncomposing the ninth circuit, the distances between the places at which\r\nthey sit and from thence to the seat of Government, are represented to\r\nbe such as to render it impossible for the judge of that circuit to\r\nperform in a manner corresponding with the public exigencies his term\r\nand circuit duties. A revision, therefore, of the present arrangement of\r\nthe circuit seems to be called for and is recommended to your notice.\r\n\r\nI think it proper to call your attention to the power assumed by\r\nTerritorial legislatures to authorize the issue of bonds by corporate\r\ncompanies on the guaranty of the Territory. Congress passed a law in\r\n1836 providing that no act of a Territorial legislature incorporating\r\nbanks should have the force of law until approved by Congress, but acts\r\nof a very exceptionable character previously passed by the legislature\r\nof Florida were suffered to remain in force, by virtue of which bonds\r\nmay be issued to a very large amount by those institutions upon the\r\nfaith of the Territory. A resolution, intending to be a joint one,\r\npassed the Senate at the same session, expressing the sense of Congress\r\nthat the laws in question ought not to be permitted to remain in force\r\nunless amended in many material respects; but it failed in the House of\r\nRepresentatives for want of time, and the desired amendments have not\r\nbeen made. The interests involved are of great importance, and the\r\nsubject deserves your early and careful attention.\r\n\r\nThe continued agitation of the question relative to the best mode of\r\nkeeping and disbursing the public money still injuriously affects the\r\nbusiness of the country. The suspension of specie payments in 1837\r\nrendered the use of deposit banks as prescribed by the act of 1836 a\r\nsource rather of embarrassment than aid, and of necessity placed the\r\ncustody of most of the public money afterwards collected in charge of\r\nthe public officers. The new securities for its safety which this\r\nrequired were a principal cause of my convening an extra session of\r\nCongress, but in consequence of a disagreement between the two Houses\r\nneither then nor at any subsequent period has there been any legislation\r\non the subject. The effort made at the last session to obtain the\r\nauthority of Congress to punish the use of public money for private\r\npurposes as a crime--a measure attended under other governments with\r\nsignal advantage--was also unsuccessful, from diversities of opinion in\r\nthat body, notwithstanding the anxiety doubtless felt by it to afford\r\nevery practicable security. The result of this is still to leave the\r\ncustody of the public money without those safeguards which have been for\r\nseveral years earnestly desired by the Executive, and as the remedy is\r\nonly to be found in the action of the Legislature it imposes on me the\r\nduty of again submitting to you the propriety of passing a law providing\r\nfor the safe-keeping of the public moneys, and especially to ask that\r\nits use for private purposes by any officers intrusted with it may be\r\ndeclared to be a felony, punishable with penalties proportioned to the\r\nmagnitude of the offense.\r\n\r\nThese circumstances, added to known defects in the existing laws and\r\nunusual derangement in the general operations of trade, have during\r\nthe last three years much increased the difficulties attendant on the\r\ncollection, keeping, and disbursement of the revenue, and called forth\r\ncorresponding exertions from those having them in charge. Happily these\r\nhave been successful beyond expectation. Vast sums have been collected\r\nand disbursed by the several Departments with unexpected cheapness and\r\nease, transfers have been readily made to every part of the Union,\r\nhowever distant, and defalcations have been far less than might have\r\nbeen anticipated from the absence of adequate legal restraints. Since\r\nthe officers of the Treasury and Post-Office Departments were charged\r\nwith the custody of most of the public moneys received by them there\r\nhave been collected $66,000,000, and, excluding the case of the late\r\ncollector at New York, the aggregate amount of losses sustained in the\r\ncollection can not, it is believed, exceed $60,000. The defalcation\r\nof the late collector at that city, of the extent and circumstances\r\nof which Congress have been fully informed, ran through all the modes\r\nof keeping the public money that have been hitherto in use, and was\r\ndistinguished by an aggravated disregard of duty that broke through\r\nthe restraints of every system, and can not, therefore, be usefully\r\nreferred to as a test of the comparative safety of either. Additional\r\ninformation will also be furnished by the report of the Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury, in reply to a call made upon that officer by the House\r\nof Representatives at the last session requiring detailed information\r\non the subject of defaults by public officers or agents under each\r\nAdministration from 1789 to 1837. This document will be submitted to\r\nyou in a few days. The general results (independent of the Post-Office,\r\nwhich is kept separately and will be stated by itself), so far as they\r\nbear upon this subject, are that the losses which have been and are\r\nlikely to be sustained by any class of agents have been the greatest by\r\nbanks, including, as required in the resolution, their depreciated paper\r\nreceived for public dues; that the next largest have been by disbursing\r\nofficers, and the least by collectors and receivers. If the losses on\r\nduty bonds are included, they alone will be threefold those by both\r\ncollectors and receivers. Our whole experience, therefore, furnishes the\r\nstrongest evidence that the desired legislation of Congress is alone\r\nwanting to insure in those operations the highest degree of security\r\nand facility. Such also appears to have been the experience of other\r\nnations. From the results of inquiries made by the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury in regard to the practice among them I am enabled to state\r\nthat in twenty-two out of twenty-seven foreign governments from which\r\nundoubted information has been obtained the public moneys are kept in\r\ncharge of public officers. This concurrence of opinion in favor of\r\nthat system is perhaps as great as exists on any question of internal\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\nIn the modes of business and official restraints on disbursing officers\r\nno legal change was produced by the suspension of specie payments. The\r\nreport last referred to will be found to contain also much useful\r\ninformation in relation to this subject.\r\n\r\nI have heretofore assigned to Congress my reasons for believing that\r\nthe establishment of an independent National Treasury, as contemplated\r\nby the Constitution, is necessary to the safe action of the Federal\r\nGovernment. The suspension of specie payments in 1837 by the banks\r\nhaving the custody of the public money showed in so alarming a degree\r\nour dependence on those institutions for the performance of duties\r\nrequired by law that I then recommended the entire dissolution of that\r\nconnection. This recommendation has been subjected, as I desired it\r\nshould be, to severe scrutiny and animated discussion, and I allow\r\nmyself to believe that notwithstanding the natural diversities of\r\nopinion which may be anticipated on all subjects involving such\r\nimportant considerations, it has secured in its favor as general a\r\nconcurrence of public sentiment as could be expected on one of such\r\nmagnitude.\r\n\r\nRecent events have also continued to develop new objections to such a\r\nconnection. Seldom is any bank, under the existing system and practice,\r\nable to meet on demand all its liabilities for deposits and notes in\r\ncirculation. It maintains specie payments and transacts a profitable\r\nbusiness only by the confidence of the public in its solvency, and\r\nwhenever this is destroyed the demands of its depositors and note\r\nholders, pressed more rapidly than it can make collections from its\r\ndebtors, force it to stop payment. This loss of confidence, with its\r\nconsequences, occurred in 1837, and afforded the apology of the banks\r\nfor their suspension. The public then acquiesced in the validity of the\r\nexcuse, and while the State legislatures did not exact from them their\r\nforfeited charters, Congress, in accordance with the recommendation of\r\nthe Executive, allowed them time to pay over the public money they held,\r\nalthough compelled to issue Treasury notes to supply the deficiency thus\r\ncreated.\r\n\r\nIt now appears that there are other motives than a want of public\r\nconfidence under which the banks seek to justify themselves in a refusal\r\nto meet their obligations. Scarcely were the country and Government\r\nrelieved in a degree from the difficulties occasioned by the general\r\nsuspension of 1837 when a partial one, occurring within thirty months\r\nof the former, produced new and serious embarrassments, though it had\r\nno palliation in such circumstances as were alleged in justification\r\nof that which had previously taken place. There was nothing in the\r\ncondition of the country to endanger a well-managed banking institution;\r\ncommerce was deranged by no foreign war; every branch of manufacturing\r\nindustry was crowned with rich rewards, and the more than usual\r\nabundance of our harvests, after supplying our domestic wants, had left\r\nour granaries and storehouses filled with a surplus for exportation.\r\nIt is in the midst of this that an irredeemable and depreciated paper\r\ncurrency is entailed upon the people by a large portion of the banks.\r\nThey are not driven to it by the exhibition of a loss of public\r\nconfidence or of a sudden pressure from their depositors or note\r\nholders, but they excuse themselves by alleging that the current of\r\nbusiness and exchange with foreign countries, which draws the precious\r\nmetals from their vaults, would require in order to meet it a larger\r\ncurtailment of their loans to a comparatively small portion of the\r\ncommunity than it will be convenient for them to bear or perhaps safe\r\nfor the banks to exact. The plea has ceased to be one of necessity.\r\nConvenience and policy are now deemed sufficient to warrant these\r\ninstitutions in disregarding their solemn obligations. Such conduct\r\nis not merely an injury to individual creditors, but it is a wrong to\r\nthe whole community, from whose liberality they hold most valuable\r\nprivileges, whose rights they violate, whose business they derange, and\r\nthe value of whose property they render unstable and insecure. It must\r\nbe evident that this new ground for bank suspensions, in reference to\r\nwhich their action is not only disconnected with, but wholly independent\r\nof, that of the public, gives a character to their suspensions more\r\nalarming than any which they exhibited before, and greatly increases\r\nthe impropriety of relying on the banks in the transactions of the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nA large and highly respectable portion of our banking institutions are,\r\nit affords me unfeigned pleasure to state, exempted from all blame on\r\naccount of this second delinquency. They have, to their great credit,\r\nnot only continued to meet their engagements, but have even repudiated\r\nthe grounds of suspension now resorted to. It is only by such a course\r\nthat the confidence and good will of the community can be preserved, and\r\nin the sequel the best interests of the institutions themselves\r\npromoted.\r\n\r\nNew dangers to the banks are also daily disclosed from the extension\r\nof that system of extravagant credit of which they are the pillars.\r\nFormerly our foreign commerce was principally founded on an exchange\r\nof commodities, including the precious metals, and leaving in its\r\ntransactions but little foreign debt. Such is not now the case. Aided\r\nby the facilities afforded by the banks, mere credit has become too\r\ncommonly the basis of trade. Many of the banks themselves, not content\r\nwith largely stimulating this system among others, have usurped the\r\nbusiness, while they impair the stability, of the mercantile community;\r\nthey have become borrowers instead of lenders; they establish their\r\nagencies abroad; they deal largely in stocks and merchandise; they\r\nencourage the issue of State securities until the foreign market is\r\nglutted with them; and, unsatisfied with the legitimate use of their own\r\ncapital and the exercise of their lawful privileges, they raise by large\r\nloans additional means for every variety of speculation. The disasters\r\nattendant on this deviation from the former course of business in this\r\ncountry are now shared alike by banks and individuals to an extent of\r\nwhich there is perhaps no previous example in the annals of our country.\r\nSo long as a willingness of the foreign lender and a sufficient export\r\nof our productions to meet any necessary partial payments leave the flow\r\nof credit undisturbed all appears to be prosperous, but as soon as it\r\nis checked by any hesitation abroad or by an inability to make payment\r\nthere in our productions the evils of the system are disclosed. The\r\npaper currency, which might serve for domestic purposes, is useless\r\nto pay the debt due in Europe. Gold and silver are therefore drawn in\r\nexchange for their notes from the banks. To keep up their supply of coin\r\nthese institutions are obliged to call upon their own debtors, who pay\r\nthem principally in their own notes, which are as unavailable to them as\r\nthey are to the merchants to meet the foreign demand. The calls of the\r\nbanks, therefore, in such emergencies of necessity exceed that demand,\r\nand produce a corresponding curtailment of their accommodations and\r\nof the currency at the very moment when the state of trade renders it\r\nmost inconvenient to be borne. The intensity of this pressure on the\r\ncommunity is in proportion to the previous liberality of credit and\r\nconsequent expansion of the currency. Forced sales of property are made\r\nat the time when the means of purchasing are most reduced, and the worst\r\ncalamities to individuals are only at last arrested by an open violation\r\nof their obligations by the banks--a refusal to pay specie for their\r\nnotes and an imposition upon the community of a fluctuating and\r\ndepreciated currency.\r\n\r\nThese consequences are inherent in the present system. They are not\r\ninfluenced by the banks being large or small, created by National\r\nor State Governments. They are the results of the irresistible laws\r\nof trade or credit. In the recent events, which have so strikingly\r\nillustrated the certain effects of these laws, we have seen the bank\r\nof the largest capital in the Union, established under a national\r\ncharter, and lately strengthened, as we were authoritatively informed,\r\nby exchanging that for a State charter with new and unusual\r\nprivileges--in a condition, too, as it was said, of entire soundness\r\nand great prosperity--not merely unable to resist these effects, but\r\nthe first to yield to them.\r\n\r\nNor is it to be overlooked that there exists a chain of necessary\r\ndependence among these institutions which obliges them to a great extent\r\nto follow the course of others, notwithstanding its injustice to their\r\nown immediate creditors or injury to the particular community in which\r\nthey are placed. This dependence of a bank, which is in proportion to\r\nthe extent of its debts for circulation and deposits, is not merely on\r\nothers in its own vicinity, but on all those which connect it with the\r\ncenter of trade. Distant banks may fail without seriously affecting\r\nthose in our principal commercial cities, but the failure of the latter\r\nis felt at the extremities of the Union. The suspension at New York in\r\n1837 was everywhere, with very few exceptions, followed as soon as it\r\nwas known. That recently at Philadelphia immediately affected the banks\r\nof the South and West in a similar manner. This dependence of our whole\r\nbanking system on the institutions in a few large cities is not found\r\nin the laws of their organization, but in those of trade and exchange.\r\nThe banks at that center, to which currency flows and where it is\r\nrequired in payments for merchandise, hold the power of controlling\r\nthose in regions whence it comes, while the latter possess no means\r\nof restraining them; so that the value of individual property and the\r\nprosperity of trade through the whole interior of the country are made\r\nto depend on the good or bad management of the banking institutions in\r\nthe great seats of trade on the seaboard.\r\n\r\nBut this chain of dependence does not stop here. It does not terminate\r\nat Philadelphia or New York. It reaches across the ocean and ends in\r\nLondon, the center of the credit system. The same laws of trade which\r\ngive to the banks in our principal cities power over the whole banking\r\nsystem of the United States subject the former, in their turn, to the\r\nmoney power in Great Britain. It is not denied that the suspension of\r\nthe New York banks in 1837, which was followed in quick succession\r\nthroughout the Union, was produced by an application of that power, and\r\nit is now alleged, in extenuation of the present condition of so large\r\na portion of our banks, that their embarrassments have arisen from the\r\nsame cause.\r\n\r\nFrom this influence they can not now entirely escape, for it has its\r\norigin in the credit currencies of the two countries; it is strengthened\r\nby the current of trade and exchange which centers in London, and is\r\nrendered almost irresistible by the large debts contracted there by our\r\nmerchants, our banks, and our States. It is thus that an introduction of\r\na new bank into the most distant of our villages places the business of\r\nthat village within the influence of the money power in England; it is\r\nthus that every new debt which we contract in that country seriously\r\naffects our own currency and extends over the pursuits of our citizens\r\nits powerful influence. We can not escape from this by making new banks,\r\ngreat or small, State or national. The same chains which bind those\r\nnow existing to the center of this system of paper credit must equally\r\nfetter every similar institution we create. It is only by the extent to\r\nwhich this system has been pushed of late that we have been made fully\r\naware of its irresistible tendency to subject our own banks and\r\ncurrency to a vast controlling power in a foreign land, and it adds\r\na new argument to those which illustrate their precarious situation.\r\nEndangered in the first place by their own mismanagement and again by\r\nthe conduct of every institution which connects them with the center of\r\ntrade in our own country, they are yet subjected beyond all this to the\r\neffect of whatever measures policy, necessity, or caprice may induce\r\nthose who control the credits of England to resort to. I mean not\r\nto comment upon these measures, present or past, and much less to\r\ndiscourage the prosecution of fair commercial dealing between the two\r\ncountries, based on reciprocal benefits; but it having now been made\r\nmanifest that the power of inflicting these and similar injuries is by\r\nthe resistless law of a credit currency and credit trade equally capable\r\nof extending their consequences through all the ramifications of our\r\nbanking system, and by that means indirectly obtaining, particularly\r\nwhen our banks are used as depositories of the public moneys, a\r\ndangerous political influence in the United States, I have deemed it my\r\nduty to bring the subject to your notice and ask for it your serious\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nIs an argument required beyond the exposition of these facts to show\r\nthe impropriety of using our banking institutions as depositories of\r\nthe public money? Can we venture not only to encounter the risk of\r\ntheir individual and mutual mismanagement, but at the same time to place\r\nour foreign and domestic policy entirely under the control of a foreign\r\nmoneyed interest? To do so is to impair the independence of our\r\nGovernment, as the present credit system has already impaired the\r\nindependence of our banks; it is to submit all its important operations,\r\nwhether of peace or war, to be controlled or thwarted, at first by our\r\nown banks and then by a power abroad greater than themselves. I can not\r\nbring myself to depict the humiliation to which this Government and\r\npeople might be sooner or later reduced if the means for defending their\r\nrights are to be made dependent upon those who may have the most\r\npowerful of motives to impair them.\r\n\r\nNor is it only in reference to the effect of this state of things on the\r\nindependence of our Government or of our banks that the subject presents\r\nitself for consideration; it is to be viewed also in its relations to\r\nthe general trade of our country. The time is not long passed when a\r\ndeficiency of foreign crops was thought to afford a profitable market\r\nfor the surplus of our industry, but now we await with feverish anxiety\r\nthe news of the English harvest, not so much from motives of commendable\r\nsympathy, but fearful lest its anticipated failure should narrow the\r\nfield of credit there. Does not this speak volumes to the patriot? Can\r\na system be beneficent, wise, or just which creates greater anxiety for\r\ninterests dependent on foreign credit than for the general prosperity of\r\nour own country and the profitable exportation of the surplus produce of\r\nour labor?\r\n\r\nThe circumstances to which I have thus adverted appear to me to afford\r\nweighty reasons, developed by late events, to be added to those which\r\nI have on former occasions offered when submitting to your better\r\nknowledge and discernment the propriety of separating the custody of the\r\npublic money from banking institutions. Nor has anything occurred to\r\nlessen, in my opinion, the force of what has been heretofore urged.\r\nThe only ground on which that custody can be desired by the banks is\r\nthe profitable use which they may make of the money. Such use would\r\nbe regarded in individuals as a breach of trust or a crime of great\r\nmagnitude, and yet it may be reasonably doubted whether, first and last,\r\nit is not attended with more mischievous consequences when permitted to\r\nthe former than to the latter. The practice of permitting the public\r\nmoney to be used by its keepers, as here, is believed to be peculiar to\r\nthis country and to exist scarcely anywhere else. To procure it here\r\nimproper influences are appealed to, unwise connections are established\r\nbetween the Government and vast numbers of powerful State institutions,\r\nother motives than the public good are brought to bear both on the\r\nexecutive and legislative departments, and selfish combinations leading\r\nto special legislation are formed. It is made the interest of banking\r\ninstitutions and their stockholders throughout the Union to use their\r\nexertions for the increase of taxation and the accumulation of a surplus\r\nrevenue, and while an excuse is afforded the means are furnished for\r\nthose excessive issues which lead to extravagant trading and speculation\r\nand are the forerunners of a vast debt abroad and a suspension of the\r\nbanks at home.\r\n\r\nImpressed, therefore, as I am with the propriety of the funds of the\r\nGovernment being withdrawn from the private use of either banks or\r\nindividuals, and the public money kept by duly appointed public agents,\r\nand believing as I do that such also is the judgment which discussion,\r\nreflection, and experience have produced on the public mind, I leave the\r\nsubject with you. It is, at all events, essential to the interests of\r\nthe community and the business of the Government that a decision should\r\nbe made.\r\n\r\nMost of the arguments that dissuade us from employing banks in the\r\ncustody and disbursement of the public money apply with equal force to\r\nthe receipt of their notes for public dues. The difference is only in\r\nform. In one instance the Government is a creditor for its deposits, and\r\nin the other for the notes it holds. They afford the same opportunity\r\nfor using the public moneys, and equally lead to all the evils attendant\r\nupon it, since a bank can as safely extend its discounts on a deposit\r\nof its notes in the hands of a public officer as on one made in its own\r\nvaults. On the other hand, it would give to the Government no greater\r\nsecurity, for in case of failure the claim of the note holder would be\r\nno better than that of a depositor.\r\n\r\nI am aware that the danger of inconvenience to the public and\r\nunreasonable pressure upon sound banks have been urged as objections\r\nto requiring the payment of the revenue in gold and silver. These\r\nobjections have been greatly exaggerated. From the best estimates we may\r\nsafely fix the amount of specie in the country at $85,000,000, and the\r\nportion of that which would be employed at any one time in the receipts\r\nand disbursements of the Government, even if the proposed change were\r\nmade at once, would not, it is now, after fuller investigation, believed\r\nexceed four or five millions. If the change were gradual, several\r\nyears would elapse before that sum would be required, with annual\r\nopportunities in the meantime to alter the law should experience prove\r\nit to be oppressive or inconvenient. The portions of the community on\r\nwhose business the change would immediately operate are comparatively\r\nsmall, nor is it believed that its effect would be in the least unjust\r\nor injurious to them.\r\n\r\nIn the payment of duties, which constitute by far the greater portion of\r\nthe revenue, a very large proportion is derived from foreign commission\r\nhouses and agents of foreign manufacturers, who sell the goods consigned\r\nto them generally at auction, and after paying the duties out of the\r\navails remit the rest abroad in specie or its equivalent. That the\r\namount of duties should in such cases be also retained in specie can\r\nhardly be made a matter of complaint. Our own importing merchants,\r\nby whom the residue of the duties is paid, are not only peculiarly\r\ninterested in maintaining a sound currency, which the measure in\r\nquestion will especially promote, but are from the nature of their\r\ndealings best able to know when specie will be needed and to procure\r\nit with the least difficulty or sacrifice. Residing, too, almost\r\nuniversally in places where the revenue is received and where the drafts\r\nused by the Government for its disbursements must concentrate, they have\r\nevery opportunity to obtain and use them in place of specie should it be\r\nfor their interest or convenience. Of the number of these drafts and the\r\nfacilities they may afford, as well as of the rapidity with which the\r\npublic funds are drawn and disbursed, an idea may be formed from the\r\nfact that of nearly $20,000,000 paid to collectors and receivers during\r\nthe present year the average amount in their hands at any one time has\r\nnot exceeded a million and a half, and of the fifteen millions received\r\nby the collector of New York alone during the present year the average\r\namount held by him subject to draft during each week has been less than\r\nhalf a million.\r\n\r\nThe ease and safety of the operations of the Treasury in keeping the\r\npublic money are promoted by the application of its own drafts to the\r\npublic dues. The objection arising from having them too long outstanding\r\nmight be obviated and they yet made to afford to merchants and banks\r\nholding them an equivalent for specie, and in that way greatly lessen\r\nthe amount actually required. Still less inconvenience will attend the\r\nrequirement of specie in purchases of public lands. Such purchases,\r\nexcept when made on speculation, are in general but single transactions,\r\nrarely repeated by the same person; and it is a fact that for the\r\nlast year and a half, during which the notes of sound banks have been\r\nreceived, more than a moiety of these payments has been voluntarily made\r\nin specie, being a larger proportion than would have been required in\r\nthree years under the graduation proposed.\r\n\r\nIt is, moreover, a principle than which none is better settled by\r\nexperience that the supply of the precious metals will always be found\r\nadequate to the uses for which they are required. They abound in\r\ncountries where no other currency is allowed. In our own States, where\r\nsmall notes are excluded, gold and silver supply their place. When\r\ndriven to their hiding places by bank suspensions, a little firmness in\r\nthe community soon restores them in a sufficient quantity for ordinary\r\npurposes. Postage and other public dues have been collected in coin\r\nwithout serious inconvenience even in States where a depreciated paper\r\ncurrency has existed for years, and this, with the aid of Treasury\r\nnotes for a part of the time, was done without interruption during the\r\nsuspension of 1837. At the present moment the receipts and disbursements\r\nof the Government are made in legal currency in the largest portion of\r\nthe Union. No one suggests a departure from this rule, and if it can now\r\nbe successfully carried out it will be surely attended with even less\r\ndifficulty when bank notes are again redeemed in specie.\r\n\r\nIndeed, I can not think that a serious objection would anywhere be\r\nraised to the receipt and payment of gold and silver in all public\r\ntransactions were it not from an apprehension that a surplus in the\r\nTreasury might withdraw a large portion of it from circulation and lock\r\nit up unprofitably in the public vaults. It would not, in my opinion,\r\nbe difficult to prevent such an inconvenience from occurring; but the\r\nauthentic statements which I have already submitted to you in regard\r\nto the actual amount in the public Treasury at any one time during the\r\nperiod embraced in them and the little probability of a different state\r\nof the Treasury for at least some years to come seem to render it\r\nunnecessary to dwell upon it. Congress, moreover, as I have before\r\nobserved, will in every year have an opportunity to guard against it\r\nshould the occurrence of any circumstances lead us to apprehend injury\r\nfrom this source. Viewing the subject in all its aspects, I can not\r\nbelieve that any period will be more auspicious than the present for the\r\nadoption of all measures necessary to maintain the sanctity of our own\r\nengagements and to aid in securing to the community that abundant supply\r\nof the precious metals which adds so much to their prosperity and gives\r\nsuch increased stability to all their dealings.\r\n\r\nIn a country so commercial as ours banks in some form will probably\r\nalways exist, but this serves only to render it the more incumbent on\r\nus, notwithstanding the discouragements of the past, to strive in our\r\nrespective stations to mitigate the evils they produce; to take from\r\nthem as rapidly as the obligations of public faith and a careful\r\nconsideration of the immediate interests of the community will permit\r\nthe unjust character of monopolies; to check, so far as may be\r\npracticable, by prudent legislation those temptations of interest and\r\nthose opportunities for their dangerous indulgence which beset them on\r\nevery side, and to confine them strictly to the performance of their\r\nparamount duty--that of aiding the operations of commerce rather than\r\nconsulting their own exclusive advantage. These and other salutary\r\nreforms may, it is believed, be accomplished without the violation of\r\nany of the great principles of the social compact, the observance of\r\nwhich is indispensable to its existence, or interfering in any way with\r\nthe useful and profitable employment of real capital.\r\n\r\nInstitutions so framed have existed and still exist elsewhere, giving\r\nto commercial intercourse all necessary facilities without inflating or\r\ndepreciating the currency or stimulating speculation. Thus accomplishing\r\ntheir legitimate ends, they have gained the surest guaranty for their\r\nprotection and encouragement in the good will of the community. Among\r\na people so just as ours the same results could not fail to attend a\r\nsimilar course. The direct supervision of the banks belongs, from the\r\nnature of our Government, to the States who authorize them. It is to\r\ntheir legislatures that the people must mainly look for action on that\r\nsubject. But as the conduct of the Federal Government in the management\r\nof its revenue has also a powerful, though less immediate, influence\r\nupon them, it becomes our duty to see that a proper direction is given\r\nto it. While the keeping of the public revenue in a separate and\r\nindependent treasury and of collecting it in gold and silver will have\r\na salutary influence on the system of paper credit with which all banks\r\nare connected, and thus aid those that are sound and well managed, it\r\nwill at the same time sensibly check such as are otherwise by at once\r\nwithholding the means of extravagance afforded by the public funds and\r\nrestraining them from excessive issues of notes which they would be\r\nconstantly called upon to redeem.\r\n\r\nI am aware it has been urged that this control may be best attained and\r\nexerted by means of a national bank. The constitutional objections\r\nwhich I am well known to entertain would prevent me in any event from\r\nproposing or assenting to that remedy; but in addition to this, I can\r\nnot after past experience bring myself to think that it can any longer\r\nbe extensively regarded as effective for such a purpose. The history of\r\nthe late national bank, through all its mutations, shows that it was\r\nnot so. On the contrary, it may, after a careful consideration of the\r\nsubject, be, I think, safely stated that at every period of banking\r\nexcess it took the lead; that in 1817 and 1818, in 1823, in 1831, and\r\nin 1834 its vast expansions, followed by distressing contractions, led\r\nto those of the State institutions. It swelled and maddened the tides of\r\nthe banking system, but seldom allayed or safely directed them. At a few\r\nperiods only was a salutary control exercised, but an eager desire, on\r\nthe contrary, exhibited for profit in the first place; and if afterwards\r\nits measures were severe toward other institutions, it was because its\r\nown safety compelled it to adopt them. It did not differ from them in\r\nprinciple or in form; its measures emanated from the same spirit of\r\ngain; it felt the same temptation to overissues; it suffered from and\r\nwas totally unable to avert those inevitable laws of trade by which it\r\nwas itself affected equally with them; and at least on one occasion, at\r\nan early day, it was saved only by extraordinary exertions from the same\r\nfate that attended the weakest institution it professed to supervise.\r\nIn 1837 it failed equally with others in redeeming its notes (though\r\nthe two years allowed by its charter for that purpose had not expired),\r\na large amount of which remains to the present time outstanding. It is\r\ntrue that, having so vast a capital and strengthened by the use of all\r\nthe revenues of the Government, it possessed more power; but while it\r\nwas itself by that circumstance freed from the control which all banks\r\nrequire, its paramount object and inducement were left the same--to\r\nmake the most for its stockholders, not to regulate the currency of the\r\ncountry. Nor has it, as far as we are advised, been found to be greatly\r\notherwise elsewhere. The national character given to the Bank of England\r\nhas not prevented excessive fluctuations in their currency, and it\r\nproved unable to keep off a suspension of specie payments, which lasted\r\nfor nearly a quarter of a century. And why should we expect it to be\r\notherwise? A national institution, though deriving its charter from a\r\ndifferent source than the State banks, is yet constituted upon the same\r\nprinciples, is conducted by men equally exposed to temptation, and is\r\nliable to the same disasters, with the additional disadvantage that\r\nits magnitude occasions an extent of confusion and distress which the\r\nmismanagement of smaller institutions could not produce. It can scarcely\r\nbe doubted that the recent suspension of the United States Bank of\r\nPennsylvania, of which the effects are felt not in that State alone, but\r\nover half the Union, had its origin in a course of business commenced\r\nwhile it was a national institution, and there is no good reason for\r\nsupposing that the same consequences would not have followed had it\r\nstill derived its powers from the General Government. It is in vain,\r\nwhen the influences and impulses are the same, to look for a difference\r\nin conduct or results. By such creations we do, therefore, but increase\r\nthe mass of paper credit and paper currency, without checking their\r\nattendant evils and fluctuations. The extent of power and the efficiency\r\nof organization which we give, so far from being beneficial, are in\r\npractice positively injurious. They strengthen the chain of dependence\r\nthroughout the Union, subject all parts more certainly to common\r\ndisaster, and bind every bank more effectually in the first instance\r\nto those of our commercial cities, and in the end to a foreign power.\r\nIn a word, I can not but believe that, with the full understanding of\r\nthe operations of our banking system which experience has produced,\r\npublic sentiment is not less opposed to the creation of a national bank\r\nfor purposes connected with currency and commerce than for those\r\nconnected with the fiscal operations of the Government.\r\n\r\nYet the commerce and currency of the country are suffering evils from\r\nthe operations of the State banks which can not and ought not to be\r\noverlooked. By their means we have been flooded with a depreciated\r\npaper, which it was evidently the design of the framers of the\r\nConstitution to prevent when they required Congress to \"coin money and\r\nregulate the value of foreign coins,\" and when they forbade the States\r\n\"to coin money, emit bills of credit, make anything but gold and silver\r\na tender in payment of debts,\" or \"pass any law impairing the obligation\r\nof contracts.\" If they did not guard more explicitly against the present\r\nstate of things, it was because they could not have anticipated that the\r\nfew banks then existing were to swell to an extent which would expel to\r\nso great a degree the gold and silver for which they had provided from\r\nthe channels of circulation, and fill them with a currency that defeats\r\nthe objects they had in view. The remedy for this must chiefly rest with\r\nthe States from whose legislation it has sprung. No good that might\r\naccrue in a particular case from the exercise of powers not obviously\r\nconferred on the General Government would authorize its interference or\r\njustify a course that might in the slightest degree increase at the\r\nexpense of the States the power of the Federal authorities; nor do\r\nI doubt that the States will apply the remedy. Within the last few\r\nyears events have appealed to them too strongly to be disregarded.\r\nThey have seen that the Constitution, though theoretically adhered to,\r\nis subverted in practice; that while on the statute books there is no\r\nlegal tender but gold and silver, no law impairing the obligations of\r\ncontracts, yet that in point of fact the privileges conferred on banking\r\ncorporations have made their notes the currency of the country; that the\r\nobligations imposed by these notes are violated under the impulses of\r\ninterest or convenience, and that the number and power of the persons\r\nconnected with these corporations or placed under their influence give\r\nthem a fearful weight when their interest is in opposition to the spirit\r\nof the Constitution and laws. To the people it is immaterial whether\r\nthese results are produced by open violations of the latter or by the\r\nworkings of a system of which the result is the same. An inflexible\r\nexecution even of the existing statutes of most of the States would\r\nredress many evils now endured, would effectually show the banks the\r\ndangers of mismanagement which impunity encourages them to repeat,\r\nand would teach all corporations the useful lesson that they are the\r\nsubjects of the law and the servants of the people. What is still\r\nwanting to effect these objects must be sought in additional\r\nlegislation, or, if that be inadequate, in such further constitutional\r\ngrants or restrictions as may bring us back into the path from which\r\nwe have so widely wandered.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime it is the duty of the General Government to cooperate\r\nwith the States by a wise exercise of its constitutional powers and\r\nthe enforcement of its existing laws. The extent to which it may do so\r\nby further enactments I have already adverted to, and the wisdom of\r\nCongress may yet enlarge them. But above all, it is incumbent upon us\r\nto hold erect the principles of morality and law, constantly executing\r\nour own contracts in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution,\r\nand thus serving as a rallying point by which our whole country may be\r\nbrought back to that safe and honored standard.\r\n\r\nOur people will not long be insensible to the extent of the burdens\r\nentailed upon them by the false system that has been operating on\r\ntheir sanguine, energetic, and industrious character, nor to the means\r\nnecessary to extricate themselves from these embarrassments. The weight\r\nwhich presses upon a large portion of the people and the States is\r\nan enormous debt, foreign and domestic. The foreign debt of our\r\nStates, corporations, and men of business can scarcely be less than\r\n$200,000,000, requiring more than $10,000,000 a year to pay the\r\ninterest. This sum has to be paid out of the exports of the country,\r\nand must of necessity cut off imports to that extent or plunge the\r\ncountry more deeply in debt from year to year. It is easy to see that\r\nthe increase of this foreign debt must augment the annual demand on\r\nthe exports to pay the interest, and to the same extent diminish the\r\nimports, and in proportion to the enlargement of the foreign debt and\r\nthe consequent increase of interest must be the decrease of the import\r\ntrade. In lieu of the comforts which it now brings us we might have\r\nour gigantic banking institutions and splendid, but in many instances\r\nprofitless, railroads and canals absorbing to a great extent in interest\r\nupon the capital borrowed to construct them the surplus fruits of\r\nnational industry for years to come, and securing to posterity no\r\nadequate return for the comforts which the labors of their hands might\r\notherwise have secured. It is not by the increase of this debt that\r\nrelief is to be sought, but in its diminution. Upon this point there\r\nis, I am happy to say, hope before us; not so much in the return of\r\nconfidence abroad, which will enable the States to borrow more money, as\r\nin a change of public feeling at home, which prompts our people to pause\r\nin their career and think of the means by which debts are to be paid\r\nbefore they are contracted. If we would escape embarrassment, public and\r\nprivate, we must cease to run in debt except for objects of necessity\r\nor such as will yield a certain return. Let the faith of the States,\r\ncorporations, and individuals already pledged be kept with the most\r\npunctilious regard. It is due to our national character as well as\r\nto justice that this should on the part of each be a fixed principle\r\nof conduct. But it behooves us all to be more chary in pledging it\r\nhereafter. By ceasing to run in debt and applying the surplus of our\r\ncrops and incomes to the discharge of existing obligations, buying less\r\nand selling more, and managing all affairs, public and private, with\r\nstrict economy and frugality, we shall see our country soon recover from\r\na temporary depression, arising not from natural and permanent causes,\r\nbut from those I have enumerated, and advance with renewed vigor in her\r\ncareer of prosperity.\r\n\r\nFortunately for us at this moment, when the balance of trade is greatly\r\nagainst us and the difficulty of meeting it enhanced by the disturbed\r\nstate of our money affairs, the bounties of Providence have come to\r\nrelieve us from the consequences of past errors. A faithful application\r\nof the immense results of the labors of the last season will afford\r\npartial relief for the present, and perseverance in the same course will\r\nin due season accomplish the rest. We have had full experience in times\r\npast of the extraordinary results which can in this respect be brought\r\nabout in a short period by the united and well-directed efforts of a\r\ncommunity like ours. Our surplus profits, the energy and industry of our\r\npopulation, and the wonderful advantages which Providence has bestowed\r\nupon our country in its climate, its various productions, indispensable\r\nto other nations, will in due time afford abundant means to perfect the\r\nmost useful of those objects for which the States have been plunging\r\nthemselves of late in embarrassment and debt, without imposing on\r\nourselves or our children such fearful burdens.\r\n\r\nBut let it be indelibly engraved on our minds that relief is not to be\r\nfound in expedients. Indebtedness can not be lessened by borrowing more\r\nmoney or by changing the form of the debt. The balance of trade is not\r\nto be turned in our favor by creating new demands upon us abroad. Our\r\ncurrency can not be improved by the creation of new banks or more issues\r\nfrom those which now exist. Although these devices sometimes appear to\r\ngive temporary relief, they almost invariably aggravate the evil in the\r\nend. It is only by retrenchment and reform--by curtailing public and\r\nprivate expenditures, by paying our debts, and by reforming our banking\r\nsystem--that we are to expect effectual relief, security for the future,\r\nand an enduring prosperity. In shaping the institutions and policy of\r\nthe General Government so as to promote as far as it can with its\r\nlimited powers these important ends, you may rely on my most cordial\r\ncooperation.\r\n\r\nThat there should have been in the progress of recent events doubts in\r\nmany quarters and in some a heated opposition to every change can not\r\nsurprise us. Doubts are properly attendant on all reform, and it is\r\npeculiarly in the nature of such abuses as we are now encountering to\r\nseek to perpetuate their power by means of the influence they have been\r\npermitted to acquire. It is their result, if not their object, to gain\r\nfor the few an ascendency over the many by securing to them a monopoly\r\nof the currency, the medium through which most of the wants of mankind\r\nare supplied; to produce throughout society a chain of dependence which\r\nleads all classes to look to privileged associations for the means of\r\nspeculation and extravagance; to nourish, in preference to the manly\r\nvirtues that give dignity to human nature, a craving desire for\r\nluxurious enjoyment and sudden wealth, which renders those who seek\r\nthem dependent on those who supply them; to substitute for republican\r\nsimplicity and economical habits a sickly appetite for effeminate\r\nindulgence and an imitation of that reckless extravagance which\r\nimpoverished and enslaved the industrious people of foreign lands, and\r\nat last to fix upon us, instead of those equal political rights the\r\nacquisition of which was alike the object and supposed reward of our\r\nRevolutionary struggle, a system of exclusive privileges conferred by\r\npartial legislation. To remove the influences which had thus gradually\r\ngrown up among us, to deprive them of their deceptive advantages, to\r\ntest them by the light of wisdom and truth, to oppose the force which\r\nthey concentrate in their support--all this was necessarily the work of\r\ntime, even among a people so enlightened and pure as that of the United\r\nStates. In most other countries, perhaps, it could only be accomplished\r\nthrough that series of revolutionary movements which are too often found\r\nnecessary to effect any great and radical reform; but it is the crowning\r\nmerit of our institutions that they create and nourish in the vast\r\nmajority of our people a disposition and a power peaceably to remedy\r\nabuses which have elsewhere caused the effusion of rivers of blood and\r\nthe sacrifice of thousands of the human race. The result thus far is\r\nmost honorable to the self-denial, the intelligence, and the patriotism\r\nof our citizens; it justifies the confident hope that they will carry\r\nthrough the reform which has been so well begun, and that they will go\r\nstill further than they have yet gone in illustrating the important\r\ntruth that a people as free and enlightened as ours will, whenever\r\nit becomes necessary, show themselves to be indeed capable of\r\nself-government by voluntarily adopting appropriate remedies for every\r\nabuse, and submitting to temporary sacrifices, however great, to insure\r\ntheir permanent welfare.\r\n\r\nMy own exertions for the furtherance of these desirable objects have\r\nbeen bestowed throughout my official career with a zeal that is\r\nnourished by ardent wishes for the welfare of my country, and by an\r\nunlimited reliance on the wisdom that marks its ultimate decision on all\r\ngreat and controverted questions. Impressed with the solemn obligations\r\nimposed upon me by the Constitution, desirous also of laying before my\r\nfellow-citizens, with whose confidence and support I have been so highly\r\nhonored, such measures as appear to me conducive to their prosperity,\r\nand anxious to submit to their fullest consideration the grounds upon\r\nwhich my opinions are formed, I have on this as on preceding occasions\r\nfreely offered my views on those points of domestic policy that seem\r\nat the present time most prominently to require the action of the\r\nGovernment. I know that they will receive from Congress that full and\r\nable consideration which the importance of the subjects merits, and\r\nI can repeat the assurance heretofore made that I shall cheerfully and\r\nreadily cooperate with you in every measure that will tend to promote\r\nthe welfare of the Union.\r\n\r\nM.

VAN BUREN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, _December 11, 1839_.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nSIR: In submitting the accompanying list[55] of promotions and\r\nappointments, which I respectfully recommend for your approval, I beg\r\nleave to call your attention to that part of it which relates to the\r\nQuartermaster's Department.\r\n\r\nThe seventh section of the act of 2d of March, 1821, fixing the\r\nmilitary peace establishment, provides \"that there shall be one\r\nQuartermaster-General; that there shall be two quartermasters with\r\nthe rank, pay, and emoluments of majors of cavalry, and ten assistant\r\nquartermasters, who shall, in addition to their pay in the line, receive\r\na sum not less than ten nor more than twenty dollars per month, to be\r\nregulated by the Secretary of War.\"\r\n\r\nThe third section of the act of the 18th May, 1826, provides for \"two\r\nadditional quartermasters and ten assistant quartermasters, to be taken\r\nfrom the line of the Army, who shall have the same rank and compensation\r\nas are provided for like grades by the act of the 2d March, 1821,\" above\r\nquoted; that is to say, the two additional quartermasters shall have the\r\n\"rank, pay, and emoluments of majors of cavalry,\" and the ten additional\r\nassistant quartermasters \"shall, in addition to their pay in the line,\r\nreceive a sum not less than $10 nor more than $20 per month.\"\r\n\r\nThe ninth section of the act of the 5th July, 1838, provides \"that the\r\nPresident of the United States be authorized, by and with the advice and\r\nconsent of the Senate, to add to the Quartermaster's Department not\r\nexceeding two assistant quartermasters-general with the rank of colonel,\r\ntwo deputy quartermasters-general with the rank of lieutenant-colonel,\r\nand eight assistant quartermasters with the rank of captain; that the\r\nassistant quartermasters now in service shall have the same rank as is\r\nprovided by this act for those hereby authorized: ... _Provided_, That\r\nall the appointments in the Quartermaster's Department shall be made\r\nfrom the Army, ... and that promotions in said Department shall take\r\nplace as in regiments and corps.\"\r\n\r\nThese are believed to be the only laws now in force which provide for\r\nthe organization of the Quartermaster's Department, and they are here\r\ncited with a view to a full and clear understanding of the question of\r\nprecedence of rank between certain officers of that Department.\r\n\r\nPrior to the act of the 5th of July, 1838, last quoted, the assistant\r\nquartermasters were selected from the several regiments of the line to\r\nperform duty in the Quartermaster's Department. They were never\r\ncommissioned in the Department; they merely received letters of\r\nappointment as assistant quartermasters, and were allowed the additional\r\npay provided by the act of the 2d March, 1821, and 16th May, 1826. They\r\nheld no rank in the Department separate from their rank in the line, and\r\nwere liable to be returned to their regiments according to the wants of\r\nthe service or at the pleasure of the President. In completing the\r\norganization of the Department provided by the act of 5th July. 1838,\r\nseveral officers were selected from regiments for appointment as\r\nassistant quartermasters whose lineal rank was greater than that held by\r\nthe assistant quartermasters then doing duty in the Department, and on\r\nthe 7th of July, the list being nearly completed, it was submitted to\r\nthe Senate for confirmation. All the assistant quartermasters thus\r\nsubmitted to the Senate were confirmed to take rank from the 7th of\r\nJuly, and in the order they were nominated, which was according to their\r\nseniority in the line and agreeably to what was conceived to be the\r\nintention of the law. Had the opposite course been pursued, the\r\nlieutenants serving in the Department must either have outranked some of\r\nthe captains selected or else the selections must have been confined\r\naltogether to the subaltern officers of the Army. It will appear,\r\ntherefore, that the relative rank of these officers has been properly\r\nsettled, both by a fair construction of the law and the long-established\r\nregulation of the service which requires that \"in cases where\r\ncommissions of the same grade and date interfere a retrospect is to be\r\nhad to former commissions in actual service at the time of appointment.\"\r\nBut as several of the assistant quartermasters who were doing duty in\r\nthe Department prior to the act of the 5th of July, 1838, have felt\r\nthemselves aggrieved by this construction of the law, and have urged a\r\nconsideration of their claims to priority of rank, I have felt it my\r\nduty to lay their communications before you, with a view to their being\r\nsubmitted to the Senate with the accompanying list,[55] should you think\r\nproper to do so.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, very respectfully, your most obedient servant,\r\n\r\nJ.R. POINSETT.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 55: Omitted.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 17, 1839_.\r\n\r\nHon. WM. R. KING,\r\n\r\n_President of the Senate_.\r\n\r\nSIR: I transmit herewith a report made to me by the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury, with accompanying documents, in regard to some difficulties\r\nwhich have occurred concerning the kind of papers deemed necessary to be\r\nprovided by law for the use and protection of American vessels engaged\r\nin the whale fisheries, and would respectfully invite the consideration\r\nof Congress to some new legislation on a subject of so much interest and\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\nM.

The disagreement as to the\r\nextent of their respective jurisdictions has produced a state of\r\nsuch great excitement that I think it necessary to invite your early\r\nattention to the report of the commissioner appointed to run the line\r\nin question under the act of the 18th of June, 1838, which was sent\r\nto both Houses of Congress by the Secretary of State on the 30th of\r\nJanuary last.\r\n\r\nM.

The circumstances under\r\nwhich these duties were demanded being, as stated by the Secretary\r\nof the Treasury, of a character to entitle the parties to relief,\r\nI recommend the adoption of the necessary legislative provisions to\r\nauthorize their repayment. I likewise invite your attention to the\r\nevidence contained in the accompanying documents as to the treatment of\r\nour vessels in the port of Cayenne, which will doubtless be found by\r\nCongress such as to authorize the application to French vessels coming\r\nfrom that colony of the liberal principles of reciprocity which have\r\nhitherto governed the action of the legislature in analogous cases.\r\n\r\nM.

Having no authority to enter into the\r\nproposed negotiation, I can only submit the subject to the consideration\r\nof Congress.

The statement showing the amount, it will be seen from the\r\naccompanying communication of the Secretary of War, will take some\r\nlittle time, but will be prepared as early as possible and transmitted.\r\n\r\nM. VAN BUREN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 13, 1840_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI again submit to you the amended treaty of June 11, 1838, with the\r\nNew York Indians. It is accompanied by minutes of the proceedings of\r\na council held with them at Cattaraugus on the 13th and 14th days of\r\nAugust, 1839, at which were present on the part of the United States the\r\nSecretary of War and on the part of the State of Massachusetts General\r\nH.A.S. Dearborn, its commissioner; by various documentary testimony, and\r\nby a memorial presented in behalf of the several committees on Indian\r\nconcerns appointed by the four yearly meetings of Friends of Genesee,\r\nNew York, Philadelphia, and Baltimore. In the latter document the\r\nmemorialists not only insist upon the irregularity and illegality of the\r\nnegotiation, but urge a variety of considerations which appear to them\r\nto be very conclusive against the policy of the removal itself. The\r\nmotives by which they have been induced to take so deep an interest\r\nin the subject are frankly set forth, and are doubtless of the most\r\nbeneficent character. They have, however, failed to remove my decided\r\nconviction that the proposed removal, if it can be accomplished by\r\nproper means, will be alike beneficial to the Indians, to the State\r\nin which the land is situated, and to the more general interest of\r\nthe United States upon the subject of Indian affairs.\r\n\r\nThe removal of the New York Indians is not only important to the tribes\r\nthemselves, but to an interesting portion of western New York, and\r\nespecially to the growing city of Buffalo, which is surrounded by lands\r\noccupied by the Senecas. To the Indians themselves it presents the only\r\nprospect of preservation. Surrounded as they are by all the influences\r\nwhich work their destruction, by temptation they can not resist and\r\nartifices they can not counteract, they are rapidly declining, and,\r\nnotwithstanding the philanthropic efforts of the Society of Friends,\r\nit is believed that where they are they must soon become extinct; and\r\nto this portion of our country the extraordinary spectacle is presented\r\nof densely populated and highly improved settlements inhabited by\r\nindustrious, moral, and respectable citizens, divided by a wilderness\r\non one side of which is a city of more than 20,000 souls, whose\r\nadvantageous position in every other respect and great commercial\r\nprospects would insure its rapid increase in population and wealth\r\nif not retarded by the circumstance of a naturally fertile district\r\nremaining a barren waste in its immediate vicinity. Neither does it\r\nappear just to those who are entitled to the fee simple of the land,\r\nand who have paid a part of the purchase money, that they should suffer\r\nfrom the waste which is constantly committed upon their reversionary\r\nrights and the great deterioration of the land consequent upon such\r\ndepredations without any corresponding advantage to the Indian\r\noccupants.\r\n\r\nThe treaty, too, is recommended by the liberality of its provisions.\r\nThe cession contained in the first article embraces the right, title,\r\nand interest secured to \"the Six Nations of the New York Indians and\r\nSt. Regis tribe\" in lands at Green Bay by the Menomonee treaty of 8th\r\nFebruary, 1831, the supplement thereto of 17th of same month, and the\r\nconditions upon which they were ratified by the Senate, except a tract\r\non which a part of the New York Indians now reside. The Menomonee treaty\r\nassigned them 500,000 acres, coupled with the original condition that\r\nthey should remove to them within three years after the date of the\r\ntreaty, modified by the supplement so as to empower the President to\r\nprescribe the term within which they should remove to the Green Bay\r\nlands, and that if they neglected to do so within the period limited\r\nso much of the land as should be unoccupied by them at the termination\r\nthereof should revert to the United States. To these lands the New\r\nYork Indians claimed title, which was resisted, and, for quieting\r\nthe controversy, by the treaty of 1831 the United States paid a large\r\nconsideration; and it will be seen that by using the power given in the\r\ntreaty the Executive might put an end to the Indian claim. Instead of\r\nthis harsher measure, for a grant of all their interest in Wisconsin,\r\nwhich, deducting the land in the actual occupancy of New York Indians,\r\namounts to about 435,000 acres, the treaty as amended by the Senate\r\ngives 1,824,000 acres of lands in the West and the sum of $400,000 for\r\ntheir removal and subsistence, for education and agricultural purposes,\r\nthe erection of mills and the necessary houses, and the promotion of\r\nthe mechanic arts. Besides, there are special money provisions for the\r\nCayugas, the Onondagas, the Oneidas of New York, the Tuscaroras, and\r\nSt. Regis Indians, and an engagement to receive from Ogden and Fellows\r\nfor the Senecas $202,000; to invest $100,000 of this sum in safe stocks\r\nand to distribute $102,000 among the owners of improvements in New York\r\naccording to an appraisement; to sell for the Tuscaroras 5,000 acres\r\nof land they hold in Niagara County, N.Y., and to invest the proceeds,\r\nexclusive of what may be received for improvements, \"the income from\r\nwhich shall be paid to the nation at their new homes annually, and the\r\nmoney which shall be received for improvements on said lands shall\r\nbe paid to the owners of the improvements when the lands are sold.\"\r\nThese are the substantial parts of the treaty, and are so careful of\r\nIndian advantage that one might suppose they would be satisfactory to\r\nthose most anxious for their welfare. The right they cede could be\r\nextinguished by a course that treaty provisions justify and authorize.\r\nSo long as they persevere in their determination to remain in New York\r\nit is of no service to them, and for this naked right it is seen what\r\nthe United States propose to give them besides the sum of $202,000,\r\nwhich will be due from the purchasers of their occupant right to the\r\nSenecas, and $9,600 to the Tuscaroras for their title to 1,920 acres\r\nof land in Ontario County, N.Y., exclusive of the 5,000 acres above\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nBut whilst such are my views in respect to the measure itself, and while\r\nI shall feel it to be my duty to labor for its accomplishment by the\r\nproper use of all the means that are or shall be placed at my disposal\r\nby Congress, I am at the same time equally desirous to avoid the use of\r\nany which are inconsistent with those principles of benevolence and\r\njustice which I on a former occasion endeavored to show have in the main\r\ncharacterized the dealings of the Federal Government with the Indian\r\ntribes from the Administration of President Washington to the present\r\ntime. The obstacles to the execution of the treaty grow out of the\r\nfollowing considerations: The amended treaty was returned to me by your\r\nbody at the close of its last session, accompanied by a resolution\r\nsetting forth that \"whenever the President of the United States shall be\r\nsatisfied that the assent of the Seneca tribe of Indians has been given\r\nto the amended treaty of June 11, 1838, with the New York Indians,\r\naccording to the true intent and meaning of the resolution of the 11th\r\nof June, 1838, the Senate recommend that the President make proclamation\r\nof said treaty and carry the same into effect.\" The resolution of the\r\n11th of June, 1838, provided that \"the said treaty shall have no force\r\nor effect whatever as relates to any of the said tribes, nations, or\r\nbands of New York Indians, nor shall it be understood that the Senate\r\nhave assented to any of the contracts connected with it until the same,\r\nwith the amendments herein proposed, is submitted and fully explained\r\nby the commissioner of the United States to each of the said tribes or\r\nbands separately assembled in council, and they have given their free\r\nand voluntary consent thereto.\" The amended treaty was submitted to the\r\nchiefs of the several tribes and its provisions explained to them in\r\ncouncil. A majority of the chiefs of each of the tribes of New York\r\nIndians signed the treaty in council, except the Senecas. Of them only\r\n16 signed in council, 13 signed at the commissioner's office, and 2, who\r\nwere confined by indisposition, at home. This was reported to the War\r\nDepartment in October, 1838, and in January, 1839, a final return of\r\nthe proceedings of the commissioner was made, by which it appeared that\r\n41 signatures of chiefs, including 6 out of the 8 sachems of the nation,\r\nhad been affixed to the treaty. The number of chiefs of the Seneca\r\nNation entitled to act for the people is variously estimated from\r\n74 to 80, and by some at a still higher number. Thus it appears that,\r\nestimating the number of chiefs at 80--and it is believed there are at\r\nleast that number--there was only a bare majority of them who signed the\r\ntreaty, and only 16 gave their assent to it in council. The Secretary of\r\nWar was under these circumstances directed to meet the chiefs of the New\r\nYork Indians in council, in order to ascertain, if possible, the views\r\nof the several tribes, and especially of the Senecas, in relation to\r\nthe amended treaty. He did so in the month of August last, and the\r\nminutes of the proceedings of that council are herewith submitted.\r\nMuch opposition was manifested by a party of the Senecas, and from some\r\ncause or other some of the chiefs of the other tribes who had in former\r\ncouncils consented to the treaty appeared to be now opposed to it.\r\nDocuments were presented showing that some of the Seneca chiefs had\r\nreceived assurances of remuneration from the proprietors of the land,\r\nprovided they assented to the treaty and used their influence to obtain\r\nthat of the nation, while testimony was offered on the other side to\r\nprove that many had been deterred from signing and taking part in favor\r\nof the treaty by threats of violence, which, from the late intelligence\r\nof the cruel murders committed upon the signers of the Cherokee treaty,\r\nproduced a panic among the partisans of that now under consideration.\r\nWhatever may have been the means used by those interested in the fee\r\nsimple of these lands to obtain the assent of Indians, it appears from\r\nthe disinterested and important testimony of the commissioner appointed\r\nby the State of Massachusetts that the agent of the Government acted\r\nthroughout with the utmost fairness, and General Dearborn declares\r\nhimself to be perfectly satisfied that were it not for the unremitted\r\nand disingenuous exertions of a certain number of white men who are\r\nactuated by their private interests, to induce the chiefs not to assent\r\nto the treaty, it would immediately have been approved by an immense\r\nmajority--an opinion which he reiterated at Cattaraugus. Statements were\r\npresented to the Secretary of War at Cattaraugus to show that a vast\r\nmajority of the New York Indians were adverse to the treaty, but no\r\nreasonable doubt exists that the same influence which obtained this\r\nexpression of opinion would, if exerted with equal zeal on the other\r\nside, have produced a directly opposite effect and shown a large\r\nmajority in favor of emigration. But no advance toward obtaining the\r\nassent of the Seneca tribe to the amended treaty in council was made,\r\nnor can the assent of a majority of them in council be now obtained.\r\nIn the report of the committee of the Senate, upon the subject of this\r\ntreaty, of the 28th of February last it is stated as follows:\r\n\r\n  But it is in vain to contend that the signatures of the last ten, which\r\n  were obtained on the second mission, or of the three who have sent on\r\n  their assent lately, is such a signing as was contemplated by the\r\n  resolution of the Senate. It is competent, however, for the Senate to\r\n  waive the usual and customary forms in this instance and consider the\r\n  signatures of these last thirteen as good as though they had been\r\n  obtained in open council. But the committee can not recommend the\r\n  adoption of such a practice in making treaties, for divers good reasons,\r\n  which must be obvious to the Senate; and among those reasons against\r\n  these secret individual negotiations is the distrust created that the\r\n  chiefs so acting are doing what a majority of their people do not\r\n  approve of, or else that they are improperly acted upon by bribery or\r\n  threats or unfair influences. In this case we have most ample\r\n  illustrations. Those opposed to the treaty accuse several of those who\r\n  signed their assent to the amended treaty with having been bribed, and\r\n  in at least one instance they make out the charge very clearly.\r\n\r\nAlthough the committee, being four in number, were unable to agree upon\r\nany recommendation to the Senate, it does not appear that there was any\r\ndiversity of opinion amongst them in regard to this part of the report.\r\nThe provision of the resolution of the Senate of the 11th of June,\r\n1838, requiring the assent of each of the said tribes of Indians to\r\nthe amended treaty to be given in council, and which was also made a\r\ncondition precedent to the recommendation to me of the Senate of the 2d\r\nof March, 1839, to carry the same into effect, has not, therefore, been\r\ncomplied with as it respects the Seneca tribe.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, insisted by the advocates for the execution of the\r\ntreaty that it was the intention of the Senate by their resolution of\r\nthe 2d of March, 1839, to waive so much of the requirement of that\r\nof the 11th of June, 1838, as made it necessary that the assent of\r\nthe different tribes should be given in council. This assumption is\r\nunderstood to be founded upon the circumstances that the fact that\r\nonly sixteen of the chiefs had given their assent in that form had\r\nbeen distinctly communicated to the Senate before the passage of the\r\nresolution of the 2d of March, and that instead of being a majority that\r\nnumber constituted scarcely one-fifth of the whole number of chiefs, and\r\nit is hence insisted that unless the Senate had so intended there would\r\nhave been no use in sending the amended treaty to the President with the\r\nadvice contained in that resolution. This has not appeared to me to be\r\na necessary deduction from the foregoing facts, as the Senate may have\r\ncontemplated that the assent of the tribe in the form first required\r\nshould be thereafter obtained, and before the treaty was executed, and\r\nthe phraseology of the resolution, viz, \"that whenever the President\r\nshall be satisfied,\" etc., goes far to sustain this construction. The\r\ninterpretation of the acts of the Senate set up by the advocates for the\r\ntreaty is, moreover, in direct opposition to the disclaimer contained in\r\nthe report of the committee which has been adverted to. It is at best an\r\ninference only, in respect to the truth of which the Senate can alone\r\nspeak with certainty, and which could not with propriety be regarded\r\nas justifying the desired action in relation to the execution of the\r\ntreaty.\r\n\r\nThis measure is further objected to on the ground of improper\r\ninducements held out to the assenting chiefs by the agents of the\r\nproprietors of the lands, which, it is insisted, ought to invalidate\r\nthe treaty if even the requirement that the assent of the chiefs should\r\nbe given in council was dispensed with. Documentary evidence upon\r\nthis subject was laid before you at the last session, and is again\r\ncommunicated, with additional evidence upon the same point. The charge\r\nappears by the proceedings of the Senate to have been investigated by\r\nyour committee, but no conclusion upon the subject formed other than\r\nthat which is contained in the extract from the report of the committee\r\nI have referred to, and which asserts that at least in one instance the\r\ncharge of bribery has been clearly made out. That improper means have\r\nbeen employed to obtain the assent of the Seneca chiefs there is every\r\nreason to believe, and I have not been able to satisfy myself that\r\nI can, consistently with the resolution of the Senate of the 2d of\r\nMarch, 1839, cause the treaty to be carried into effect in respect to\r\nthe Seneca tribe.\r\n\r\nYou will perceive that this treaty embraces the Six Nations of New York\r\nIndians, occupying different reservations, but bound together by common\r\nties, and it will be expedient to decide whether in the event of that\r\npart of it which concerns the Senecas being rejected it shall be\r\nconsidered valid in relation to the other tribes, or whether the whole\r\nconfederacy shall share one fate. In the event of the Senate not\r\nadvising the ratification of the amended treaty, I invite your attention\r\nto the proposal submitted by the dissentients to authorize a division\r\nof the lands, so that those who prefer it may go West and enjoy the\r\nadvantages of a permanent home there, and of their proportion of the\r\nannuities now payable, as well as of the several pecuniary and other\r\nbeneficiary provisions of the amended treaty.\r\n\r\nM.

VAN BUREN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Fox to Mr. Forsyth_.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 26, 1840_.\r\n\r\nHon. JOHN FORSYTH, etc.:\r\n\r\nThe undersigned, Her Britannic Majesty's envoy extraordinary and\r\nminister plenipotentiary, has the honor to acquaint Mr. Forsyth,\r\nSecretary of State of the United States, that since the date of his\r\nlast official note, of the 12th instant, he has been furnished by Her\r\nMajesty's authorities in North America with more correct information\r\nthan he then possessed respecting certain reported movements of British\r\ntroops within the disputed territory, which formed the subject of a part\r\nof that official note, as well as of the two official notes addressed by\r\nthe Secretary of State to the undersigned on the 24th of December and\r\non the 16th of the present month. The same reported movements of troops\r\nwere referred to in a recent message from the governor of Maine to\r\nthe legislature of the State, and also in a published official letter\r\naddressed by the governor of Maine to the President of the United States\r\non the 23d of December.\r\n\r\nIt appears from accurate information now in the possession of the\r\nundersigned that the governor of Maine and through him the President\r\nand General Government of the United States have been misinformed as to\r\nthe facts. In the first place, no reenforcement has been marched to the\r\nBritish post at the Lake Temiscouata; the only change occurring there\r\nhas been the relief of a detachment of Her Majesty's Twenty-fourth\r\nRegiment by a detachment of equal force of the Eleventh Regiment, this\r\nforce of one company being now stationed at the Temiscouata post, as\r\nit always has been, for the necessary purpose of protecting the stores\r\nand accommodations provided for the use of Her Majesty's troops who\r\nmay be required, as heretofore, to march by that route to and from the\r\nProvinces of Canada and New Brunswick. In the second place, it is not\r\ntrue that the British authorities either have built or are building\r\nbarracks on both sides of the St. John River or at the mouth of the\r\nMadawaska River; no new barracks have in fact been built anywhere.\r\nIn the third place, Her Majesty's authorities are not concentrating a\r\nmilitary force at the Grand Falls; the same trifling force of sixteen\r\nmen is now stationed at the post of the Grand Falls which has been\r\nstationed there for the last twelvemonth. It was perhaps, however,\r\nneedless for the undersigned to advert to this last matter at all,\r\nas the post of the Grand Falls is beyond the bounds of the disputed\r\nterritory and within the acknowledged limits of New Brunswick.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned, while conveying the above information upon a matter of\r\nfact to the Secretary of State of the United States, takes occasion to\r\nrepeat distinctly his former declaration that there exists no intention\r\non the part of Her Majesty's authorities to infringe the terms of those\r\nprovisional agreements which were entered into at the beginning of\r\nlast year so long as there is reason to trust that the same will be\r\nfaithfully adhered to by the opposite party; but it is the duty of\r\nthe undersigned at the same time clearly to state that Her Majesty's\r\nauthorities in North America, taking into view the attitude assumed by\r\nthe State of Maine with reference to the boundary question, will, as\r\nat present advised, be governed entirely by circumstances in adopting\r\nsuch measures of defense and protection (whether along the confines of\r\nthe disputed territory or within that portion of it where, it has been\r\nbefore explained, the authority of Great Britain, according to the\r\nexisting agreements, was not to be interfered with) as may seem to them\r\nnecessary for guarding against or for promptly repelling the further\r\nacts of hostile aggression over the whole of the disputed territory\r\nwhich it appears to be the avowed design of the State of Maine sooner\r\nor later to attempt.\r\n\r\nFor the undersigned has to observe that not only is the extensive\r\nsystem of encroachment which was denounced and remonstrated against by\r\nthe undersigned in his official note of the 2d of last November still\r\ncarried on and persisted in by armed bands employed by the authorities\r\nof Maine in the districts above the Aroostook and Fish rivers, but that\r\nacts, as above stated, of a character yet more violent and obnoxious to\r\nthe rights of Great Britain and more dangerous to the preservation of\r\nthe general peace are with certainty meditated by the inhabitants of\r\nthat State. The existence of such designs has for months past been\r\na matter of notoriety by public report. Those designs were plainly\r\nindicated in the recent message of the governor of Maine to the\r\nlegislature of the State, and they are avowed in more explicit terms\r\nin the letter addressed to the President of the United States by the\r\ngovernor of Maine on the 21st of November, which letter has within\r\nthe last few days been communicated to Congress and published.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned, it is true, has been assured by the Secretary of State,\r\nin his note of the 16th instant, that the General Government see no\r\nreason to doubt the disposition of the governor of Maine to adhere to\r\nthe existing arrangements and to avoid all acts tending to render more\r\ndifficult and distant the final adjustment of the boundary question;\r\nbut in face of the above clear indications of the intentions of Maine as\r\ngiven out by the parties themselves the Secretary of State has not given\r\nto the undersigned any adequate assurance that Maine will be constrained\r\nto desist from carrying those intentions into effect if, contrary to the\r\nexpectation of the General Government, the legislature or the executive\r\nof the State should think fit to make the attempt.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned not only preserves the hope, but he entertains the\r\nfirm belief, that if the duty of negotiating the boundary question be\r\nleft in the hands of the two national Governments, to whom alone of\r\nright it belongs, the difficulty of conducting the negotiation to an\r\namicable issue will not be found so great as has been by many persons\r\napprehended. But the case will become wholly altered if the people\r\nof the State of Maine, who, though interested in the result, are not\r\ncharged with the negotiation, shall attempt to interrupt it by violence.\r\n\r\nHer Majesty's authorities in North America have on their part no desire\r\nor intention to interfere with the course of the pending negotiation by\r\nan exertion of military force, but they will, as at present advised,\r\nconsult their own discretion in adopting the measures of defense that\r\nmay be rendered necessary by the threats of a violent interruption to\r\nthe negotiation which have been used by all parties in Maine and which\r\nthe undersigned regrets to find confirmed by the language (as above\r\nreferred to) employed by the highest official authority in that State.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned avails himself of this occasion to renew to the\r\nSecretary of State of the United States the assurance of his\r\ndistinguished consideration.\r\n\r\nH.S. FOX.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Forsyth to Mr. Fox_.\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE.\r\n\r\n_Washington, January 28, 1840_.\r\n\r\nHENRY S. FOX, Esq., etc.:\r\n\r\nThe undersigned, Secretary of State of the United States, has the\r\nhonor to reply, by direction of the President, to the note addressed\r\nto him on the 26th instant by Mr. Fox, envoy extraordinary and minister\r\nplenipotentiary of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nThe President derives great satisfaction from the information conveyed\r\nby Mr. Fox's note that, with reference to the reported movements of\r\nBritish troops within the territory in dispute, no actual change\r\nhas taken place in the attitude of Her Majesty's authorities in the\r\nterritory since the arrangements entered into by the two Governments\r\nat the commencement of last year for the preservation of tranquillity\r\nwithin its limits, and from his assurances that there exists no\r\nintention on the part of Her Majesty's authorities to infringe the terms\r\nof those arrangements so long as they are faithfully observed on the\r\nside of the United States. The President, however, can not repress a\r\nfeeling of regret that the British colonial authorities, without graver\r\nmotives than the possibility of a departure from the arrangements\r\nreferred to by the State of Maine, should take upon themselves the\r\ndiscretion, and along with it the fearful responsibility of probable\r\nconsequences, of being guided by circumstances liable, as these are,\r\nto be misapprehended and misjudged in the adoption within the disputed\r\nterritory of measures of defense and precaution in manifest violation\r\nof the understanding between the two countries whenever they may\r\nimagine that acts of hostile aggression over the disputed territory are\r\nmeditated or threatened on the part of the State of Maine. The President\r\ncan not but hope that when Her Majesty's Government at home shall be\r\napprised of the position assumed in this regard by its colonial agents\r\nproper steps will be taken to place the performance of express and\r\nsolemn agreements upon a more secure basis than colonial discretion,\r\nto be exercised on apprehended disregard of such agreements on the part\r\nof the State of Maine.\r\n\r\nIt is gratifying to the President to perceive that Mr. Fox entertains\r\nthe firm belief that the difficulty of conducting to an amicable issue\r\nthe pending negotiation for the adjustment of the question of boundary\r\nis not so great as has by many persons been apprehended. As, under a\r\ncorresponding conviction, the United States have, with a view to the\r\nfinal settlement of that exciting question, submitted a proposition\r\nfor the consideration of Her Majesty's Government, the President hopes\r\nthat the sentiments expressed by Mr. Fox have their foundation in an\r\nexpectation of his having it in his power at an early day to communicate\r\nto this Government a result of the deliberations had by that of Her\r\nBritannic Majesty upon the proposition alluded to which will present the\r\nprospect of a prompt and satisfactory settlement, and which, when known\r\nby the State of Maine, will put an end to all grounds of apprehensions\r\nof intentions or disposition on her part to adopt any measures\r\ncalculated to embarrass the negotiation or to involve a departure from\r\nthe provisional arrangements. In the existence of those arrangements\r\nthe United States behold an earnest of the mutual desire of the two\r\nGovernments to divest a question abounding in causes of deep and growing\r\nexcitement of as much as possible of the asperity and hostile feeling it\r\nis calculated to engender; but unless attended with the most scrupulous\r\nobservance of the spirit and letter of their provisions, it would prove\r\nbut one more cause added to the many already prevailing of enmity and\r\ndiscord. Mr. Fox has already been made the channel of conveyance to his\r\nGovernment of the desire and determination of the President that the\r\nobligations of the country shall be faithfully discharged; that desire\r\nis prompted by a sense of expediency as well as of justice, and by an\r\nanxious wish to preserve the amicable relations now, so manifestly for\r\nthe advantage of both, subsisting between the United States and Great\r\nBritain.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned avails himself of the occasion to renew to Mr. Fox\r\nassurances of his distinguished consideration.\r\n\r\nJOHN FORSYTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with two resolutions of the Senate, dated the 30th ultimo,\r\ncalling for information in relation to the disputed boundary between\r\nthe State of Missouri and the Territory of Iowa, I transmit a report\r\nfrom the Secretary of State, which, with inclosures, contains all the\r\ninformation in the executive department on the subject not already\r\ncommunicated to Congress.\r\n\r\nM. VAN BUREN.\r\n\r\nJANUARY 31, 1840.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 4, 1840_.\r\n\r\n_To the Honorable the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI lay before you a report from the Secretary of the Treasury, with\r\nseveral documents annexed, by which it will be seen that judicial\r\nconstructions have been given to the existing laws for the collection\r\nof imposts, affecting extensively and injuriously the accruing revenue.\r\n\r\nThey embrace, with many others, the important articles of linens,\r\nwoolens, and cottons, the last two of which are often treated as silks,\r\nbecause that material constitutes a component part of them, and thus\r\nexempted them from duty altogether. Assessments of duties which have\r\nprevailed for years, and in some cases since the passage of the laws\r\nthemselves, are in this manner altered, and uncertainty and litigation\r\nintroduced in regard to the future.\r\n\r\nThe effects which these proceedings have already produced in diminishing\r\nthe amount of the revenue, and which are likely to increase hereafter,\r\ndeserve your early consideration.\r\n\r\nI have therefore deemed it necessary to bring the matter to your notice,\r\nwith a view to such legislative action as the exigencies of the case may\r\nin your judgment require. It is not believed that any law which can now\r\nbe passed upon the subject can affect the revenue favorably for several\r\nmonths to come, and could not, therefore, be safely regarded as a\r\nsubstitute for the early provision of certain and adequate means to\r\nenable the Treasury to guard the public credit and meet promptly and\r\nfaithfully any deficiencies that may occur in the revenue, from whatever\r\ncause they may arise.\r\n\r\nThe reasons in favor of the propriety of adopting at an early period\r\nproper measures for that purpose were explained by the Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury in his annual report and recommended to your attention\r\nby myself. The experience of the last two months, and especially the\r\nrecent decisions of the courts, with the continued suspension of\r\nspecie payments by the banks over large sections of the United States,\r\noperating unfavorably upon the revenue, have greatly strengthened the\r\nviews then taken of the subject.\r\n\r\nM. VAN BUREN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON CITY, _February 14, 1840_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI lay before you a communication from the Secretary of War, accompanied\r\nby a report of the Commissioner of Pensions, showing the great\r\nimportance of early action on the bill from the Senate providing for the\r\ncontinuance of the office of Commissioner of Pensions. The present law\r\nwill expire by its own limitation on the 4th day of the next month, and,\r\nsensible of the suffering which would be experienced by the pensioners\r\nfrom its suspension, I have deemed it my duty to bring the subject to\r\nyour notice and invite your early attention to it.\r\n\r\nM. VAN BUREN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 17, 1840.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI submit to Congress a communication from the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury, repeating suggestions contained in his annual report in regard\r\nto the necessity of an early provision by law for the protection of\r\nthe Treasury against the fluctuations and contingencies to which its\r\nreceipts are exposed, with additional facts and reasons in favor of\r\nthe propriety of the legislation then desired.\r\n\r\nThe application assumes that although the means of the Treasury for the\r\nwhole year may be equal to the expenditures of the year, the Department\r\nmay, notwithstanding, be rendered unable to meet the claims upon it at\r\nthe times when they fall due.\r\n\r\nThis apprehension arises partly from the circumstance that the largest\r\nproportion of the charges upon the Treasury, including the payment of\r\npensions and the redemption of Treasury notes, fall due in the early\r\npart of this year, viz, in the months of March and May, while the\r\nresources on which it might otherwise rely to discharge them can not be\r\nmade available until the last half of the year, and partly from the fact\r\nthat a portion of the means of the Treasury consists of debts due from\r\nbanks, for some of which delay has already been asked, and which may not\r\nbe punctually paid.\r\n\r\nConsidering the injurious consequences to the character, credit, and\r\nbusiness of the country which would result from a failure by the\r\nGovernment for ever so short a period to meet its engagements; that the\r\nhappening of such a contingency can only be effectually guarded against\r\nby the exercise of legislative authority; that the period when such\r\ndisability must arise, if at all, and which at the commencement of the\r\nsession was comparatively remote, has now approached so near as a few\r\ndays; and that the provision asked for is only intended to enable the\r\nExecutive to fulfill existing obligations, and chiefly by anticipating\r\nfunds not yet due, without making any additions to the public burdens,\r\nI have deemed the subject of sufficient urgency and importance again to\r\nask for it your early attention.\r\n\r\nM. VAN BUREN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 21, 1840_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n7th instant, I communicate a report[62] from the Secretary of State,\r\ncontaining all the information in possession of the Executive respecting\r\nthe matters referred to in that resolution.\r\n\r\nM.

VAN BUREN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT,\r\n\r\n_Augusta, February 15, 1840_.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency M. VAN BUREN,\r\n\r\n_President United States_.\r\n\r\nSIR: A communication from Mr. Fox, the British minister, to Mr. Forsyth,\r\nSecretary of State, under date of January 26, contains the following\r\nstatement:\r\n\r\n\"It appears from _accurate_ information now in possession of the\r\nundersigned that the governor of Maine and through him the President\r\nand General Government of the United States have been misinformed as to\r\nthe facts. In the first place, no _reenforcement_ has been marched to\r\nthe British post at the Lake Temiscouata; the _only change_ occurring\r\nthere has been the relief of a detachment of Her Majesty's Twenty-fourth\r\nRegiment by a detachment of _equal force_ of the Eleventh Regiment, this\r\nforce of _one company_ being now stationed at the Temiscouata post, as\r\nit _always has been_, for the necessary purpose of protecting the stores\r\nand accommodations provided for the use of Her Majesty's troops who may\r\nbe required, as heretofore, to march by that route to and from the\r\nProvinces of Canada and New Brunswick. In the second place, it is not\r\ntrue that the British authorities either have built or are building\r\nbarracks on both sides of the St. John River or at the mouth of the\r\nMadawaska River; _no new barracks have in fact been built anywhere_\"\r\n\r\nThis statement has been read by the citizens of this State with the\r\nmost profound astonishment, and however high may be the source from\r\nwhich it emanates I must be permitted to say, in the language of that\r\nhigh functionary, that \"it is not true,\" though in justice to him\r\nI should add that he has undoubtedly been misinformed. Though this\r\nState, in the vindication of her rights and maintenance of her interests\r\nrelative to her territorial boundary, from past experience had no\r\nreason to expect any material admissions of the truth on the part of\r\nthe British authorities, she was not prepared to meet such a positive\r\nand unqualified denial of facts as the foregoing exhibits, especially\r\nof facts so easily susceptible of proof. The \"_accuracy_\" of the\r\ninformation alleged to be in the possession of the minister is only\r\nequaled by the _justice_ of the pretensions heretofore set up in regard\r\nto title.\r\n\r\nBut not to be bandying assertions where proof is abundant, I deem it my\r\nduty to transmit to Your Excellency the depositions[64] of a number of\r\ngentlemen, citizens of this State, of great respectability, and whose\r\nstatements are entitled to the most implicit confidence.\r\n\r\nThese depositions abundantly prove that up to May last, nearly\r\ntwo months subsequent to the arrangement entered into through the\r\nmediation of General Scott, _no troops_ whatever were stationed at\r\nTemiscouata Lake; that in August, September, and October the number did\r\nnot exceed 25, while now it has been increased to about 200; that prior\r\nto May no barracks had been erected at Temiscouata, but that since that\r\ntime two have been built at the head of the lake, besides some five\r\nor six other buildings apparently adapted to the establishment of a\r\npermanent military post, and at the foot of the lake two or more\r\nbuildings for barracks and other military purposes; that though no\r\n_new_ barracks have been erected at Madawaska, certain buildings\r\nheretofore erected have been engaged for use as such; that a road has\r\nbeen constructed connecting the military post at the head and foot of\r\nthe lake, a tow-path made the whole length of the Madawaska River, the\r\nroad from the head of the lake to the military post at the river Des\r\nLoup thoroughly repaired, transport boats built, etc.\r\n\r\nI would further inform Your Excellency that an agent has been\r\ndispatched to Temiscouata and Madawaska for the purpose of procuring\r\nexact information of the state of things there at the present moment;\r\nbut having incidentally found some evidence of the state of things prior\r\nto November last, I have thought best to forward it without delay for\r\nthe purpose of disabusing the Government and the country of the errors\r\ninto which they may have been led by the communication before alluded\r\nto. The report of the agent will be transmitted as soon as received,\r\nwhich may not be short of two weeks.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, I have only to repeat my official call upon\r\nthe General Government for the protection of this State from _invasion_.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great respect, Your Excellency's most\r\nobedient servant,\r\n\r\nJOHN FAIRFIELD,\r\n\r\n_Governor of Maine_.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 64: Omitted.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE,\r\n\r\n_Washington, February 27, 1840_.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency JOHN FAIRFIELD,\r\n\r\n_Governor of Maine_.\r\n\r\nSir: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt at this Department of\r\nyour excellency's letter to the President of the 15th instant, inclosing\r\nthree depositions of citizens of Maine in relation to certain movements\r\nof British troops in the disputed territory. The depositions have been\r\ninformally communicated to the British minister by direction of the\r\nPresident, who desires me to apprise your excellency of his intention to\r\ncause an official communication to be addressed to the minister on the\r\nsubject so soon as the report of the agent dispatched by your order to\r\nTemiscouata and Madawaska for the purpose of procuring exact information\r\nas to the present state of things there shall have been received.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, sir, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nJOHN FORSYTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT,\r\n\r\n_Augusta, February 27, 1840_.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency M. VAN BUREN,\r\n\r\n_President United States_.\r\n\r\nSIR: Having received the report of Benjamin Wiggin, esq., the agent\r\nreferred to in my last communication, dispatched by me to the disputed\r\nterritory to obtain exact information of British military movements in\r\nthat quarter and of the existing state of things, I hasten to lay the\r\nsame[65] before you, accompanied by his plan[65] of the British military\r\npost at the head of Lake Temiscouata. It will be perceived that it goes\r\nto confirm in every essential particular the evidence already forwarded\r\nin the depositions of Messrs. Varnum, Bartlett, and Little, and is\r\ndirectly opposed to the statement contained in the letter of Mr. Fox\r\nto Mr. Forsyth under date of 26th of January last.\r\n\r\nThe course thus clearly proved to have been pursued by the British\r\nGovernment upon the disputed territory is utterly inconsistent with\r\nthe arrangement heretofore subsisting, and evinces anything but a\r\ndisposition to submit to an _amicable_ termination of the question\r\nrelating to the boundary.\r\n\r\nPermit me to add that the citizens of Maine are awaiting with deep\r\nsolicitude that action on the part of the General Government which shall\r\nvindicate the national honor and be fulfilling in part a solemn\r\nobligation to a member of the Union.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with high respect, your most obedient servant,\r\n\r\nJOHN FAIRFIELD,\r\n\r\n_Governor of Maine_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Forsyth to Mr. Fox_.\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE,\r\n\r\n_Washington, March 6, 1840_.\r\n\r\nHENRY S. FOX, Esq., etc.:\r\n\r\nBy the directions of the President, the undersigned, Secretary of State\r\nof the United States, communicates to Mr. Fox, envoy extraordinary and\r\nminister plenipotentiary of Great Britain, the inclosed copy of a\r\nreport[65] made to the governor of the State of Maine by the agent\r\ncommissioned on the part of the authorities of that State to ascertain\r\nthe precise character and extent of the occupation of parts of the\r\ndisputed territory by troops of Her Britannic Majesty and of the\r\nbuildings and other public works constructed for their use and\r\naccommodation.\r\n\r\nBy that report and the three depositions which the undersigned\r\ninformally communicated to Mr. Fox a few days since he will perceive\r\nthat there must be some extraordinary misapprehension on his part of the\r\nfacts in relation to the occupation by British troops of portions of\r\nthe disputed territory. The statements contained in these documents and\r\nthat given by Mr. Fox in his note of the 20th of January last exhibit a\r\nstriking discrepancy as to the number of troops now in the territory as\r\ncompared with those who were in it when the arrangement between Governor\r\nFairfield and Lieutenant-Governor Harvey was agreed upon, and also as\r\nto the present and former state of the buildings there. The extensive\r\naccommodations prepared and preparing at an old and at new stations, the\r\nworks finished and in the course of construction on the land and on the\r\nwater, are not in harmony with the assurance that the only object is\r\nthe preservation of a few unimportant buildings and storehouses for the\r\ntemporary protection of the number of troops Her Majesty's ordinary\r\nservice can require to pass on the road from New Brunswick to Canada.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned will abstain from any remarks upon these contradictory\r\nstatements until Mr. Fox shall have had an opportunity to obtain the\r\nmeans of fully explaining them. How essential it is that this should be\r\npromptly done, and that the steps necessary to a faithful observance\r\non the part of Her Majesty's colonial authorities of the existing\r\nagreements between the two Governments should be immediately taken,\r\nMr. Fox can not fail fully to understand.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned avails himself of the occasion to renew to Mr. Fox\r\nassurances of his high consideration.\r\n\r\nJOHN FORSYTH.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 65: Omitted.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Fox to Mr. Forsyth_.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 7, 1840_.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned, Her Britannic Majesty's envoy extraordinary and\r\nminister plenipotentiary, has the honor to acknowledge the receipt of\r\nthe official note of yesterday's date addressed to him by Mr. Forsyth,\r\nSecretary of State of the United States, to which is annexed the copy of\r\na report from Mr. Benjamin Wiggin, an agent employed by the State of\r\nMaine to visit the British military post at Lake Temiscouata, and in\r\nwhich reference is made to other papers upon the same subject, which\r\nwere informally communicated to the undersigned by Mr. Forsyth a few\r\ndays before; and the attention of the undersigned is called by Mr.\r\nForsyth to different points upon which the information contained in the\r\nsaid papers is considered to be materially at variance with that which\r\nwas conveyed to the United States Government by the undersigned in his\r\nofficial note of the 26th of last January.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned had already been made acquainted by the\r\nlieutenant-governor of New Brunswick with the circumstance of Mr.\r\nWiggin's visit to the military post at Lake Temiscouata, where the\r\nofficer in command very properly furnished to Mr. Wiggin the requisite\r\ninformation upon all matters connected with the British station which he\r\nappeared desirous to inquire about.\r\n\r\nThe alleged points of variance, after deducting what is fanciful and\r\nconjectural in the reports now produced and after comparing what is\r\nthere stated in contradiction to other reports before produced from the\r\nsame quarters, do not appear to the undersigned to be by any means so\r\nmaterial as they seem to have been considered by the Government of\r\nthe United States. The British military detachment stationed at Lake\r\nTemiscouata, which the agents employed by the State of Maine had, in\r\nthe first instance with singular exaggeration represented as amounting\r\nto two regiments, is now discovered by the same parties to amount to\r\n175 men, which instead of two regiments is something less than two\r\ncompanies. It is indeed true, should such a point be considered worth\r\ndiscussing, that the undersigned might have used a more technically\r\ncorrect expression in his note of the 26th of January if he had stated\r\nthe detachment in question to consist of from one to two companies\r\ninstead of stating it to consist of one company. But a detachment of Her\r\nMajesty's troops has been stationed at the Lake Temiscouata from time to\r\ntime ever since the winter of 1837 and 1838, when the necessity arose\r\nfrom marching reenforcements by that route from New Brunswick to Canada;\r\nand it will be remembered that a temporary right of using that route for\r\nthe same purpose was expressly reserved to Great Britain in the\r\nprovisional agreement entered into at the beginning of last year.\r\n\r\nIt is not, therefore, true that the stationing a military force at\r\nthe Lake Temiscouata is a new measure on the part of Her Majesty's\r\nauthorities; neither is it true that that measure has been adopted for\r\nother purposes than to maintain the security of the customary line of\r\ncommunication and to protect the buildings, stores, and accommodations\r\nprovided for the use of Her Majesty's troops when on march by that\r\nroute; and it was with a view to correct misapprehensions which appeared\r\nto exist upon these points, and thus to do away with one needless\r\noccasion of dispute, that the undersigned conveyed to the United States\r\nGovernment the information contained in his note of the 26th of January.\r\n\r\nWith regard again to the construction of barracks and other buildings\r\nand the preserving them in an efficient state of repair and defense, a\r\nsimilar degree of error and misapprehension appears still to prevail in\r\nthe minds of the American authorities.\r\n\r\nThe erection of those buildings within the portion of the disputed\r\nterritory now referred to, for the shelter of Her Majesty's troops while\r\non their march and for the safe lodgment of the stores, is no new act\r\non the part of Her Majesty's authorities. The buildings in question have\r\nbeen in the course of construction from a period antecedent to the\r\nprovisional agreements of last year, and they are now maintained and\r\noccupied along the line of march with a view to the same objects above\r\nspecified, for which the small detachments of troops also referred to\r\nare in like manner there stationed.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned will not refrain from here remarking upon one point\r\nof comparison exhibited in the present controversy. It is admitted by\r\nthe United States authorities that the armed bands stationed by the\r\ngovernment of Maine in the neighborhood of the Aroostook River have\r\nfortified those stations with artillery, and it is now objected as\r\nmatter of complaint against the British authorities with reference\r\nto the buildings at Lake Temiscouata, not that those buildings are\r\nfurnished with artillery, but only that they are defended by palisades\r\ncapable of resisting artillery. It would be difficult to adduce stronger\r\nevidence of the acts on the one side being those of aggression and on\r\nthe other of defense.\r\n\r\nThe fact, shortly, is (and this is the essential point of the\r\nargument) that Her Majesty's authorities have not as yet altered their\r\nstate of preparation or strengthened their military means within the\r\ndisputed territory with a view to settling the question of the boundary,\r\nalthough the attitude assumed by the State of Maine with reference to\r\nthat question would be a clear justification of such measures, and it is\r\nmuch to be apprehended that the adoption of such measures will sooner\r\nor later become indispensable if the people of Maine be not compelled\r\nto desist from the extensive system of armed aggression which they are\r\ncontinuing to carry on in other parts of the same disputed territory.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned avails himself of this occasion to renew to the\r\nSecretary of State of the United States the assurance of his\r\ndistinguished consideration.\r\n\r\nH.S. FOX.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 9, 1840_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to Congress, for their consideration, copies and translations\r\nof a correspondence between the Secretary of State and the Spanish\r\nlegation, growing out of an application on the part of Spain for a\r\nreduction of tonnage duty on her vessels in certain cases.\r\n\r\nBy a royal order issued on the 29th of April, 1832, by the King of\r\nSpain, in consequence of a representation made to his Government by\r\nthe minister of the United States against the discriminating tonnage\r\nduty then levied in the ports of Spain upon American vessels, said duty\r\nwas reduced to 1 real de vellon, equal to 5 cents, per ton, without\r\nreference to the place from whence the vessel came, being the same rate\r\nas paid by those of all other nations, including Spain.\r\n\r\nBy the act approved on the 13th of July, 1832, a corresponding reduction\r\nof tonnage duty upon Spanish vessels in ports of the United States was\r\nauthorized, but confined to vessels coming from ports in Spain; in\r\nconsequence of which said reduction has been applied to such Spanish\r\nvessels only as came directly from ports in the Spanish Peninsula.\r\n\r\nThe application of the Spanish Government is for the extension of the\r\nprovisions of the act to vessels coming from other places, and I submit\r\nfor the consideration of Congress whether the principle of reciprocity\r\nwould not justify it in regard to all vessels owned in the Peninsula and\r\nits dependencies of the Balearic and Canary islands, and coming from all\r\nplaces other than the islands of Cuba, Porto Rico, and the Philippine,\r\nand the repayment of such duties as may have been levied upon Spanish\r\nvessels of that class which have entered our ports since the act of 1832\r\nwent into operation.\r\n\r\nM.

POINSETT,\r\n\r\n_Secretary of War_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR: Negotiations with the Wyandots for a cession of their lands in\r\nOhio and removal to the country west of the Mississippi have been\r\npending for some years. During the past season two exploring parties\r\nfrom that tribe have visited the West and were tolerably well pleased\r\nwith the district to which it was proposed to remove them, but expressed\r\na strong preference for a tract which the Shawnees and Delawares offered\r\nto sell to the United States for them. The commissioner charged with the\r\nbusiness of treating with the Wyandots was of opinion that if this tract\r\ncould be procured there would be little difficulty in concluding a\r\ntreaty. He was therefore under these circumstances instructed to make\r\nthe purchase, subject to the ratification of the President and Senate\r\nand dependent on the condition that the Wyandots will accept it, and on\r\nthe 18th of December last effected a treaty with the Shawnees by which\r\nthey ceded a tract of about 58,000 acres on those conditions at the\r\nprice of $1.50 per acre. No purchase has been made from the Delawares,\r\nas they refuse to sell at a less price than $5 per acre, and it is\r\nthought that the land ceded by the Shawnees will be amply sufficient\r\nfor the present.\r\n\r\nI have the honor herewith to submit the treaty with the Shawnees,\r\nto be laid, if you think proper, before the President and Senate for\r\nratification.\r\n\r\nVery respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nT.

JOHN FORSYTH, etc.:\r\n\r\nThe undersigned, Her Britannic Majesty's envoy extraordinary and\r\nminister plenipotentiary, has been instructed by his Government to make\r\nthe following communication to the Secretary of State of the United\r\nStates in reference to the boundary negotiation and the affairs of the\r\ndisputed territory.\r\n\r\nHer Majesty's Government have had under their consideration the official\r\nnote addressed to the undersigned by the Secretary of State of the\r\nUnited States on the 24th of last December in reply to a note from the\r\nundersigned of the 2d of November preceding, in which the undersigned\r\nprotested in the name of his Government against the extensive system\r\nof aggression pursued by the people of the State of Maine within the\r\ndisputed territory, to the prejudice of the rights of Great Britain and\r\nin manifest violation of the provisional agreements entered into between\r\nthe authorities of the two countries at the beginning of the last year.\r\n\r\nHer Majesty's Government have also had their attention directed to the\r\npublic message transmitted by the governor of Maine to the legislature\r\nof the State on the 3d of January of the present year.\r\n\r\nUpon a consideration of the statements contained in these two official\r\ndocuments, Her Majesty's Government regret to find that the principal\r\nacts of encroachment which were denounced and complained of on the part\r\nof Great Britain, so far from being either disproved or discontinued or\r\nsatisfactorily explained by the authorities of the State of Maine, are,\r\non the contrary, persisted in and publicly avowed.\r\n\r\nHer Majesty's Government have consequently instructed the undersigned\r\nonce more formally to protest against those acts of encroachment and\r\naggression.\r\n\r\nHer Majesty's Government claim and expect, from the good faith of the\r\nGovernment of the United States, that the people of Maine shall replace\r\nthemselves in the situation in which they stood before the agreements\r\nof last year were signed; that they shall, therefore, retire from the\r\nvalley of the St. John and confine themselves to the valley of the\r\nAroostook; that they shall occupy that valley in a temporary manner\r\nonly, for the purpose, as agreed upon, of preventing depredations; and\r\nthat they shall not construct fortifications nor make roads or permanent\r\nsettlements.\r\n\r\nUntil this be done by the people of the State of Maine, and so long\r\nas that people shall persist in the present system of aggression, Her\r\nMajesty's Government will feel it their duty to make such military\r\narrangements as may be required for the protection of Her Majesty's\r\nrights. And Her Majesty's Government deem it right to declare that if\r\nthe result of the unjustifiable proceedings of the State of Maine should\r\nbe collision between Her Majesty's troops and the people of that State\r\nthe responsibility of all the consequences that may ensue therefrom,\r\nbe they what they may, will rest with the people and Government of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned has been instructed to add to this communication that\r\nHer Majesty's Government are only waiting for the detailed report of\r\nthe British commissioners recently employed to survey the disputed\r\nterritory, which report it was believed would be completed and delivered\r\nto Her Majesty's Government by the end of the present month, in order to\r\ntransmit to the Government of the United States a reply to their last\r\nproposal upon the subject of the boundary negotiation.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned avails himself of this occasion to renew to the\r\nSecretary of State of the United States the assurance of his\r\ndistinguished consideration.\r\n\r\nH.S. FOX.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Forsyth to Mr. Fox_.\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE,\r\n\r\n_Washington, March 25, 1840_.\r\n\r\nHENRY S. FOX, Esq., etc.:\r\n\r\nThe undersigned, Secretary of State of the United States, acknowledges\r\nto have received Mr. Fox's communication of the 13th instant, in\r\nreference to the boundary negotiation and the affairs of the disputed\r\nterritory. The information given in the closing part of it--that a reply\r\nto the last proposition of the United States upon the subject of the\r\nboundary may be expected in a short time--is highly gratifying to the\r\nPresident, who has, however, given directions to the undersigned, in\r\nmaking this acknowledgment, to accompany it with the expression of his\r\nprofound regret that Mr. Fox's note is in no other respect satisfactory.\r\n\r\nAfter the arrangements which in the beginning of last year were\r\nentered into on the part of the two Governments with regard to the\r\noccupation of the disputed territory, the President had indulged the\r\nhope that the causes of irritation which had grown out of this branch\r\nof the subject could have been removed. Relying on the disposition of\r\nMaine to cooperate with the Federal Government in all that could lead\r\nto a pacific adjustment of the principal question, the President felt\r\nconfident that his determination to maintain order and peace on the\r\nborder would be fully carried out. He looked upon all apprehensions of\r\ndesigns by the people of Maine to take possession of the territory as\r\nwithout adequate foundation, deeming it improbable that on the eve of\r\nan amicable adjustment of the question any portion of the American\r\npeople would without cause and without object jeopard the success of\r\nthe negotiation and endanger the peace of the country. A troublesome,\r\nirritating, and comparatively unimportant, because subordinate, subject\r\nbeing thus disposed of, the President hoped that the parties would be\r\nleft free at once to discuss and finally adjust the principal question.\r\nIn this he has been disappointed. While the proceedings of Her Majesty's\r\nGovernment at home have been attended with unlooked-for delays, its\r\nattention has been diverted from the great subject in controversy by\r\nrepeated complaints imputing to a portion of the people of the United\r\nStates designs to violate the engagements of their Government--designs\r\nwhich have never been entertained, and which Mr. Fox knows would receive\r\nno countenance from this Government.\r\n\r\nIt is to be regretted that at this late hour so much misapprehension\r\nstill exists on the side of the British Government as to the object and\r\nobvious meaning of the existing arrangements respecting the disputed\r\nterritory. The ill success which appears to have attended the efforts\r\nmade by the undersigned to convey through Mr. Fox to Her Majesty's\r\nGovernment more correct impressions respecting them calls for a\r\nrecurrence to the subject, and a brief review of the correspondence\r\nwhich has grown out of it may tend to remove the erroneous views which\r\nprevail as to the manner in which the terms of the arrangements referred\r\nto have been observed.\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Fox had no authority to make any agreement respecting the\r\nexercise of jurisdiction over the disputed territory, that between him\r\nand the undersigned of the 27th of February, 1839. had for its object\r\nsome provisional arrangement for the restoration and preservation of\r\npeace in the territory. To accomplish this object it provided that Her\r\nMajesty's officers should not seek to expel by military force the armed\r\nparty which had been sent by Maine into the district bordering on the\r\nRestook River, and that, on the other hand, the government of Maine\r\nwould voluntarily and without needless delay withdraw beyond the bounds\r\nof the disputed territory any armed force then within them. Besides\r\nthis, the arrangement had other objects--the dispersion of notorious\r\ntrespassers and the protection of public property from depredation.\r\nIn case future necessity should arise for this, the operation was to\r\nbe conducted by concert, jointly or separately, according to agreement\r\nbetween the governments of Maine and New Brunswick.\r\n\r\nIn this last-mentioned respect the agreement looked to some further\r\narrangement between Maine and New Brunswick. Through the agency of\r\nGeneral Scott one was agreed to on the 23d and 25th of March following,\r\nby which Sir John Harvey bound himself not to seek, without renewed\r\ninstructions to that effect from his Government, to take military\r\npossession of the territory or to expel from it by military force\r\nthe armed civil posse or the troops of Maine. On the part of Maine\r\nit was agreed by her governor that no attempt should be made, without\r\nrenewed instructions from the legislature, to disturb by arms the\r\nProvince of New Brunswick in the possession of the Madawaska settlements\r\nor interrupt the usual communications between that and the upper\r\nProvinces. As to possession and jurisdiction, they were to remain\r\nunchanged--each party holding, in fact, possession of part of the\r\ndisputed territory, but each denying the right of the other to do so.\r\nWith that understanding Maine was without unnecessary delay to withdraw\r\nher military force, leaving only, under a land agent, a small civil\r\nposse, armed or unarmed, to protect the timber recently cut and to\r\nprevent further depredations.\r\n\r\nIn the complaints of infractions of the agreements by the State of Maine\r\naddressed to the undersigned Mr. Fox has assumed two positions which are\r\nnot authorized by the terms of those agreements: First. Admitting the\r\nright of Maine to maintain a civil posse in the disputed territory for\r\nthe purposes stated in the agreement, he does so with the restriction\r\nthat the action of the posse was to be confined within certain limits;\r\nand, second, by making the advance of the Maine posse into the valley of\r\nthe Upper St. John the ground of his complaint of encroachment upon the\r\nMadawaska settlement, he assumes to extend the limits of that settlement\r\nbeyond those it occupied at the date of the agreement.\r\n\r\nThe United States can not acquiesce in either of these positions.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, nothing is found in the agreement subscribed to\r\nby Governor Fairfield and Sir John Harvey defining any limits in the\r\ndisputed territory within which the operations of the civil posse of\r\nMaine were to be circumscribed. The task of preserving the timber\r\nrecently cut and of preventing further depredations _within the disputed\r\nterritory_ was assigned to the State of Maine after her military force\r\nshould have been withdrawn from it, and it was to be accomplished by a\r\ncivil posse, armed or unarmed, which was to continue in the territory\r\nand to operate in every part of it where its agency might be required\r\nto protect the timber already cut and prevent further depredations,\r\nwithout any limitation whatever or any restrictions except such as\r\nmight be construed into an attempt to disturb by arms the Province\r\nof New Brunswick in her possession of the Madawaska settlement or\r\ninterrupt the usual communication between the Provinces.\r\n\r\nIt is thus, in the exercise of a legitimate right and in the\r\nconscientious discharge of an obligation imposed upon her by a\r\nsolemn compact, that the State of Maine has done those acts which have\r\ngiven rise to complaints for which no adequate cause is perceived.\r\nThe undersigned feels confident that when those acts shall have been\r\nconsidered by Her Majesty's Government at home as explained in his note\r\nto Mr. Fox of the 24th of December last and in connection with the\r\nforegoing remarks they will no longer be viewed as calculated to excite\r\nthe apprehensions of Her Majesty's Government that the faith of existing\r\narrangements is to be broken on the part of the United States.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the second position assumed by Mr. Fox--that the advance\r\nof the Maine posse along the valley of the Restook to the mouth of Fish\r\nRiver and into the valley of the Upper St. John is at variance with the\r\nterms and spirit of the agreements--the undersigned must observe that if\r\nat variance with any of their provisions it could only be with those\r\nwhich secure Her Majesty's Province of New Brunswick against any attempt\r\nto disturb the possession of the Madawaska settlements and to interrupt\r\nthe usual communications between New Brunswick and the upper Provinces.\r\nThe agreement could only have reference to the Madawaska settlements as\r\nconfined within their actual limits at the time it was subscribed. The\r\nundersigned in his note of the 24th of December last stated the reasons\r\nwhy the mouth of Fish River and the portion of the valley of the St.\r\nJohn through which it passes could in no proper sense be considered as\r\nembraced in the Madawaska settlements. Were the United States to admit\r\nthe pretension set up on the part of Great Britain to give to the\r\nMadawaska settlements a degree of constructive extension that might at\r\nthis time suit the purposes of Her Majesty's colonial authorities, those\r\nsettlements might soon be made with like justice to embrace any portions\r\nof the disputed territory, and the right given to the Province of New\r\nBrunswick to occupy them temporarily and for a special purpose might\r\nby inference quite as plausible give the jurisdiction exercised by Her\r\nMajesty's authorities an extent which would render the present state\r\nof the question, so long as it could be maintained, equivalent to a\r\ndecision on the merits of the whole controversy in favor of Great\r\nBritain. If the small settlement at Madawaska on the north side of the\r\nSt. John means the whole valley of that river, if a boom across the Fish\r\nRiver and a station of a small posse on the south side of the St. John\r\nat the mouth of Fish River is a disturbance of that settlement, which\r\nis 25 miles below, within the meaning of the agreement, it is difficult\r\nto conceive that there are any limitations to the pretensions of Her\r\nMajesty's Government under it or how the State of Maine could exercise\r\nthe preventive power with regard to trespassers, which was on her part\r\nthe great object of the temporary arrangement. The movements of British\r\ntroops lately witnessed in the disputed territory and the erection\r\nof military works for their protection and accommodation, of which\r\nauthentic information recently received at the Department of State has\r\nbeen communicated to Mr. Fox, impart a still graver aspect to the matter\r\nimmediately under consideration. The fact of those military operations,\r\nestablished beyond a doubt, left unexplained or unsatisfactorily\r\naccounted for by Mr. Fox's note of the 7th instant, continues an\r\nabiding cause of complaint on the part of the United States against\r\nHer Majesty's colonial agents as inconsistent with arrangements whose\r\nmain object was to divest a question already sufficiently perplexed\r\nand complicated from such embarrassments as those with which the\r\nproceedings of the British authorities can not fail to surround it.\r\n\r\nIf, as Mr. Fox must admit, the objects of the late agreements were the\r\nremoval of all military force and the preservation of the property from\r\nfurther spoliations, leaving the possession and jurisdiction as they\r\nstood before the State of Maine found itself compelled to act against\r\nthe trespassers, the President can not but consider that the conduct of\r\nthe American local authorities strongly and most favorably contrasts\r\nwith that of the colonial authorities of Her Majesty's Government. While\r\nthe one, promptly withdrawing its military force, has confined itself to\r\nthe use of the small posse, armed as agreed upon, and has done no act\r\nnot necessary to the accomplishment of the conventional objects, every\r\nmeasure taken or indicated by the other party is essentially military in\r\nits character, and can be justified only by a well-founded apprehension\r\nthat hostilities must ensue.\r\n\r\nWith such feelings and convictions the President could not see without\r\npainful surprise the attempt of Mr. Fox, under instructions from his\r\nGovernment, to give to the existing state of things a character not\r\nwarranted by the friendly disposition of the United States or the\r\nconduct of the authorities and people of Maine; much more is he\r\nsurprised to find it alleged as a ground for strengthening a military\r\nforce and preparing for a hostile collision with the unarmed inhabitants\r\nof a friendly State, pursuing within their own borders their peaceful\r\noccupations or exerting themselves in compliance with their agreements\r\nto protect the property in dispute from unauthorized spoliation.\r\n\r\nThe President wishes that he could dispel the fear that these dark\r\nforebodings can be realized. Unless Her Majesty's Government shall\r\nforthwith arrest all military interference in the question, unless it\r\nshall apply to the subject more determined efforts than have hitherto\r\nbeen made to bring the dispute to a certain and pacific adjustment, the\r\nmisfortunes predicted by Mr. Fox in the name of his Government may most\r\nunfortunately happen.\r\n\r\nBut no apprehension of the consequences alluded to by Mr. Fox can\r\nbe permitted to divert the Government and people of the United States\r\nfrom the performance of their duty to the State of Maine. That duty is\r\nas simple as it is imperative. The construction which is given by her\r\nto the treaty of 1783 has been again and again, and in the most solemn\r\nmanner, asserted also by the Federal Government, and must be maintained\r\nunless Maine freely consents to a new boundary or unless that\r\nconstruction of the treaty is found to be erroneous by the decision of\r\na disinterested and independent tribunal selected by the parties for its\r\nfinal adjustment. The President on assuming the duties of his station\r\navowed his determination, all other means of negotiation failing, to\r\nsubmit a proposition to the Government of Great Britain to refer the\r\ndecision of the question once more to a third party.\r\n\r\nIn all the subsequent steps which have been taken upon the subject by\r\nhis direction he has been actuated by the same spirit. Neither his\r\ndispositions in the matter nor his opinion as to the propriety of that\r\ncourse has undergone any change. Should the fulfillment of his wishes\r\nbe defeated, either by an unwillingness on the part of Her Majesty's\r\nGovernment to meet the offer of the United States in the spirit in\r\nwhich it is made or from adverse circumstances of any description,\r\nthe President will in any event derive great satisfaction from the\r\nconsciousness that no effort on his part has been spared to bring the\r\nquestion to an amicable conclusion, and that there has been nothing in\r\nthe conduct either of the Governments and people of the United States or\r\nof the State of Maine to justify the employment of Her Majesty's forces\r\nas indicated by Mr. Fox's letter. The President can not under such\r\ncircumstances apprehend that the responsibility for any consequences\r\nwhich may unhappily ensue will by the just judgment of an impartial\r\nworld be imputed to the United States.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned avails himself, etc.\r\n\r\nJOHN FORSYTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Fox to Mr. Forsyth_.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 26, 1840_.\r\n\r\nHon. JOHN FORSYTH, etc.:\r\n\r\nThe undersigned, Her Britannic Majesty's envoy extraordinary and\r\nminister plenipotentiary, has had the honor to receive the official note\r\nof yesterday's date addressed to him by Mr. Forsyth, Secretary of State\r\nof the United States, in reply to a note dated the 13th instant, wherein\r\nthe undersigned, in conformity with instructions received from his\r\nGovernment, had anew formally protested against the acts of encroachment\r\nand aggression which are still persisted in by armed bands in the\r\nemployment of the State of Maine within certain portions of the disputed\r\nterritory.\r\n\r\nIt will be the duty of the undersigned immediately to transmit Mr.\r\nForsyth's note to Her Majesty's Government in England, and until the\r\nstatements and propositions which it contains shall have received the\r\ndue consideration of Her Majesty's Government the undersigned will not\r\ndeem it right to add any further reply thereto excepting to refer to and\r\nrepeat, as he now formally and distinctly does, the several declarations\r\nwhich it has from time to time been his duty to make to the Government\r\nof the United States with reference to the existing posture of affairs\r\nin the disputed territory, and to record his opinion that an inflexible\r\nadherence to the resolutions that have been announced by Her Majesty's\r\nGovernment for the defense of Her Majesty's rights pending the\r\nnegotiation of the boundary question offers to Her Majesty's Government\r\nthe only means of protecting those rights from being in a continually\r\naggravated manner encroached upon and violated.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned avails himself of this occasion to renew to the\r\nSecretary of State of the United States the assurance of his\r\ndistinguished consideration.\r\n\r\nH.S.

VAN BUREN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, _March 27, 1840_.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nSIR: The resolution of the Senate of the 12th instant, \"that the\r\nPresident of the United States be requested to communicate to the\r\nSenate, if in his judgment compatible with the public interest, any\r\ninformation which may be in the possession of the Government, or which\r\ncan be conveniently obtained, of the military and naval preparations of\r\nthe British authorities on the northern frontier of the United States\r\nfrom Lake Superior to the Atlantic Ocean, designating the permanent\r\nfrom the temporary and field works, and particularly by noting those\r\nwhich are within the claimed limits of the United States,\" having been\r\nreferred by you to this Department, it was immediately referred to\r\nMajor-General Scott and other officers who have been stationed on the\r\nfrontier referred to for such information on the subjects as they\r\npossessed and could readily procure, and an examination is now in\r\nprogress for such as may be contained in the files of this Department.\r\nGeneral Scott is the only officer yet heard from, and a copy of his\r\nreport is herewith submitted, together with a copy of that to which he\r\nrefers, made upon the resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n9th instant. As soon as the other officers who have been called upon\r\nare heard from and the examination of the files of the Department is\r\ncompleted, any further information which may be thus acquired will be\r\nimmediately laid before you.\r\n\r\nVery respectfully, your most obedient servant,\r\n\r\nJ.R. POINSETT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS, EASTERN DIVISION,\r\n\r\n_Elizabethtown, N.J., March 23, 1840_.\r\n\r\nBrigadier-General R. JONES,\r\n\r\n_Adjutant-General United States Army_.\r\n\r\nSIR: I have received from your office copies of two resolutions, passed,\r\nrespectively, the 12th and 9th instant, one by the Senate and the other\r\nby the House of Representatives, and I am asked for \"any information on\r\nthe subject of both or either of the resolutions that may be in [my]\r\npossession.\"\r\n\r\nIn respect to the naval force recently maintained upon the American\r\nlakes by Great Britain, I have just had the honor to report to the\r\nSecretary of War, by whom the resolution of the House of Representatives\r\n(of the 9th instant) was directly referred to me.\r\n\r\nI now confine myself to the Senate's resolution, respecting \"military\r\n[I omit _naval_] preparations of the British authorities on the northern\r\nfrontiers of the United States from Lake Superior to the Atlantic Ocean,\r\ndistinguishing the permanent from the temporary and field works, and\r\nparticularly noting those which are within the claimed limits of the\r\nUnited States.\"\r\n\r\nI will here remark that however well my duties have made me acquainted\r\nwith the greater part of the line in question, I have paid but slight\r\nattention to the forts and barracks erected by the British authorities\r\nnear the borders of Maine _above_ Frederickton, in New Brunswick, or in\r\nUpper Canada _above_ Cornwall, being of the fixed opinion (which need\r\nnot here be developed) that all such structures would be of little or\r\nno military value to either of the parties in the event of a new war\r\nbetween the United States and Great Britain.\r\n\r\nI was last summer at the foot of Lake Superior, and neither saw nor\r\nheard of any British fort or barrack on the St. Marys River, the outlet\r\nof that lake.\r\n\r\nBetween Lakes Huron and Erie the British have three sets of\r\nbarracks--one at Windsor, opposite to Detroit; one at Sandwich, a little\r\nlower down; and the third at Maiden, 18 miles from the first--all built\r\nof sawed logs, strengthened by blockhouses, loopholes, etc. Maiden\r\nhas long been a military post, with slight defenses. These have been\r\nrecently strengthened. The works at Sandwich and Windsor have also,\r\nI think, been erected within the last six or eight months.\r\n\r\nNear the mouth of the Niagara the British have two small forts--George\r\nand Mississauga; both existed during the last war. The latter may be\r\ntermed a permanent work. Slight barracks have been erected within the\r\nlast two years on the same side near the Falls and at Chippewa, with\r\nbreastworks at the latter place, but nothing, I believe, above the\r\nworks first named on the Niagara which can be termed a fort.\r\n\r\nSince the commencement of recent troubles in the Canadas and (consequent\r\nthereupon) within our limits Fort William Henry, at Kingston, and Fort\r\nWellington, opposite to Ogdensburg (old works), have both been\r\nstrengthened within themselves, besides the addition of dependencies.\r\nThese forts may be called permanent.\r\n\r\nOn the St. Lawrence below Prescott, and confronting our territory,\r\nI know of no other military post. Twelve miles above, at Brockville,\r\nthere may be temporary barracks and breastworks. I know that of late\r\nBrockville has been a military station.\r\n\r\nIn the system of defenses on the approaches to Montreal the Isle aux\r\nNoix, a few miles below our line, and in the outlet of Lake Champlain,\r\nstands at the head. This island contains within itself a system of\r\npermanent works of great strength. On them the British Government has\r\nfrom time to time since the peace of 1815 expended much skill and labor.\r\n\r\nOdletown, near our line, on the western side of Lake Champlain, has been\r\na station for a body of Canadian militia for two years, to guard the\r\nneighborhood from refugee incendiaries from our side. I think that\r\nbarracks have been erected there for the accommodation of those troops,\r\nand also at a station, with the like object, near Alburgh, in Vermont.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that there are no important British forts or extensive\r\nBritish barracks on our borders from Vermont to Maine.\r\n\r\nIn respect to such structures on _the disputed territory_, Governor\r\nFairfield's published letters contain fuller information than has\r\nreached me through any other channel. I have heard of no new military\r\npreparations by the British authorities on the St. Croix or\r\nPassamaquoddy Bay.\r\n\r\nAmong such preparations, perhaps I ought not to omit the fact that Great\r\nBritain, besides numerous corps of well-organized and well-instructed\r\nmilitia, has at this time within her North American Provinces more than\r\n20,000 of her best regular troops. The whole of those forces might be\r\nbrought to the verge of our territory in a few days. Two-thirds of that\r\nregular force has arrived out since the spring of 1838.\r\n\r\nI remain, sir, with great respect, your most obedient servant,\r\n\r\nWINFIELD SCOTT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 28, 1840_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI communicate to the House of Representatives, in compliance with their\r\nresolution of the 9th instant, reports[67] from the Secretaries of State\r\nand War, with documents, which contain information on the subject of\r\nthat resolution.\r\n\r\nM.

I can not doubt that, with the sincere disposition\r\nwhich actuates both Governments to prevent any other than an amicable\r\ntermination of the controversy, it will be found practicable so to\r\narrange the details of a conventional agreement on the principles\r\nalluded to as to effect that object.\r\n\r\nThe British commissioners, in their report communicated by Mr. Fox,\r\nexpress an opinion that the true line of the treaty of 1783 is\r\nmaterially different from that so long contended for by Great Britain.\r\nThe report is altogether _ex parte_ in its character, and has not yet,\r\nas far as we are informed, been adopted by the British Government. It\r\nhas, however, assumed a form sufficiently authentic and important to\r\njustify the belief that it is to be used hereafter by the British\r\nGovernment in the discussion of the question of boundary; and as\r\nit differs essentially from the line claimed by the United States,\r\nan immediate preparatory exploration and survey on our part, by\r\ncommissioners appointed for that purpose, of the portions of the\r\nterritory therein more particularly brought into view would, in my\r\nopinion, be proper.

VAN BUREN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Fox to Mr. Forsyth_.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _June 22, 1840_.\r\n\r\nHon. JOHN FORSYTH, etc.:\r\n\r\nThe undersigned, Her Britannic Majesty's envoy extraordinary and\r\nminister plenipotentiary, has the honor to transmit to the Secretary of\r\nState of the United States, by order of his Government, the accompanying\r\nprinted copies of a report and map which have been presented to Her\r\nMajesty's Government by Colonel Mudge and Mr. Featherstonhaugh, the\r\ncommissioners employed during the last season to survey the disputed\r\nterritory.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned is instructed to say that it will of course have become\r\nthe duty of Her Majesty's Government to lay the said report and map\r\nbefore Parliament; but Her Majesty's Government have been desirous, as a\r\nmark of courtesy and consideration toward the Government of the United\r\nStates, that documents bearing upon a question of so much interest\r\nand importance to the two countries should in the first instance be\r\ncommunicated to the President. The documents had been officially placed\r\nin the hands of Her Majesty's Government only a few days previously\r\nto the date of the instruction addressed to the undersigned.\r\n\r\nHer Majesty's Government feel an unabated desire to bring the\r\nlong-pending questions connected with the boundary between the United\r\nStates and the British possessions in North America to a final and\r\nsatisfactory settlement, being well aware that questions of this nature,\r\nas long as they remain open between two countries, must be the source of\r\nfrequent irritation on both sides and are liable at any moment to lead\r\nto events that may endanger the existence of friendly relations.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that the questions at issue between Great Britain and\r\nthe United States must be beset with various and really existing\r\ndifficulties, or else those questions would not have remained open ever\r\nsince the year 1783, notwithstanding the frequent and earnest endeavors\r\nmade by each Government to bring them to an adjustment; but Her\r\nMajesty's Government do not relinquish the hope that the sincere desire\r\nwhich is felt by both parties to arrive at an amicable settlement will\r\nat length be attended with success.\r\n\r\nThe best clew to guide the two Governments in their future proceedings\r\nmay perhaps be obtained by an examination of the causes of past failure;\r\nand the most prominent amongst these causes has certainly been a want of\r\ncorrect information as to the topographical features and physical\r\ncharacter of the district in dispute.\r\n\r\nThis want of adequate information may be traced as one of the\r\ndifficulties which embarrassed the Netherlands Government in its\r\nendeavors to decide the points submitted to its arbitration in 1830.\r\nThe same has been felt by the Government in England; it has been felt\r\nand admitted by the Government of the United States, and even by the\r\nlocal government of the contiguous State of Maine.\r\n\r\nThe British Government and the Government of the United States agreed,\r\ntherefore, two years ago that a survey of the disputed territory by a\r\njoint commission would be the measure best calculated to elucidate and\r\nsolve the questions at issue. The President proposed such a commission\r\nand Her Majesty's Government consented to it, and it was believed by\r\nHer Majesty's Government that the general principles upon which the\r\ncommission was to be guided in its local operations had been settled by\r\nmutual agreement, arrived at by means of a correspondence which took\r\nplace between the two Governments in 1837 and 1838. Her Majesty's\r\nGovernment accordingly transmitted in April of last year, for the\r\nconsideration of the President, the draft of a convention to regulate\r\nthe proceedings of the proposed commission. The preamble of that draft\r\nrecited textually the agreement that had been come to by means of notes\r\nwhich had been exchanged between the two Governments, and the articles\r\nof the draft were framed, as Her Majesty's Government considered, in\r\nstrict conformity with that agreement.\r\n\r\nBut the Government of the United States did not think proper to assent\r\nto the convention so proposed.\r\n\r\nThe United States Government did not, indeed, allege that the\r\nproposed convention was at variance with the result of the previous\r\ncorrespondence between the two Governments, but it thought that the\r\nconvention would establish a commission of \"mere exploration and\r\nsurvey,\" and the President was of opinion that the step next to be taken\r\nby the two Governments should be to contract stipulations bearing upon\r\nthe face of them the promise of a final settlement under some form or\r\nother and within a reasonable time.\r\n\r\nThe United States Government accordingly transmitted to the undersigned,\r\nfor communication to Her Majesty's Government, in the month of July last\r\na counter draft of convention varying considerably in some parts (as the\r\nSecretary of State of the United States admitted in his letter to the\r\nundersigned of the 29th of July last) from the draft proposed by Great\r\nBritain, but the Secretary of State added that the United States\r\nGovernment did not deem it necessary to comment upon the alterations\r\nso made, as the text itself of the counter draft would be found\r\nsufficiently perspicuous.\r\n\r\nHer Majesty's Government might certainly well have expected that\r\nsome reasons would have been given to explain why the United States\r\nGovernment declined to confirm an arrangement which was founded upon\r\npropositions made by that Government itself and upon modifications to\r\nwhich that Government had agreed, or that if the American Government\r\nthought the draft of convention thus proposed was not in conformity with\r\nthe previous agreement it would have pointed out in what respect the two\r\nwere considered to differ.\r\n\r\nHer Majesty's Government, considering the present state of the boundary\r\nquestion, concur with the Government of the United States in thinking\r\nthat it is on every account expedient that the next measure to be\r\nadopted by the two Governments should contain arrangements which will\r\nnecessarily lead to a final settlement, and they think that the\r\nconvention which they proposed last year to the President, instead of\r\nbeing framed so as to constitute a mere commission of exploration and\r\nsurvey, did, on the contrary, contain stipulations calculated to lead\r\nto the final ascertainment of the boundary between the two countries.\r\n\r\nThere was, however, undoubtedly one essential difference between\r\nthe British draft and the American counter draft. The British draft\r\ncontained no provision embodying the principle of arbitration; the\r\nAmerican counter draft did contain such a provision.\r\n\r\nThe British draft contained no provision for arbitration, because the\r\nprinciple of arbitration had not been proposed on either side during the\r\nnegotiations upon which that draft was founded, and because, moreover,\r\nit was understood at that time that the principle of arbitration would\r\nbe decidedly objected to by the United States.\r\n\r\nBut as the United States Government have now expressed a wish to embody\r\nthe principle of arbitration in the proposed convention, Her Majesty's\r\nGovernment are perfectly willing to accede to that wish.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned is accordingly instructed to state officially to Mr.\r\nForsyth that Her Majesty's Government consent to the two principles\r\nwhich form the main foundation of the American counter draft, namely:\r\nFirst, that the commission to be appointed shall be so constituted as\r\nnecessarily to lead to a final settlement of the questions of boundary\r\nat issue between the two countries, and, secondly, that in order to\r\nsecure such a result the convention by which the commission is to be\r\ncreated shall contain a provision for arbitration upon points as to\r\nwhich the British and American commissioners may not be able to agree.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned is, however, instructed to add that there are many\r\nmatters of detail in the American counter draft which Her Majesty's\r\nGovernment can not adopt. The undersigned will be furnished from his\r\nGovernment, by an early opportunity, with an amended draft in conformity\r\nwith the principles above stated, to be submitted to the consideration\r\nof the President. And the undersigned expects to be at the same time\r\nfurnished with instructions to propose to the Government of the\r\nUnited States a fresh, local, and temporary convention for the better\r\nprevention of incidental border collisions within the disputed territory\r\nduring the time that may be occupied in carrying through the operations\r\nof survey or arbitration.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned avails himself of this occasion to renew to the\r\nSecretary of State the assurance of his distinguished consideration.\r\n\r\nH.S. FOX.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Forsyth to Mr. Fox_.\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE,\r\n\r\n_Washington, June 26, 1840_.\r\n\r\nH.S. FOX, Esq., etc.:\r\n\r\nThe undersigned, Secretary of State of the United States, has had the\r\nhonor to receive a note addressed to him on the 22d instant by Mr. Fox,\r\nenvoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of Great Britain,\r\ninclosing printed copies of the report and map laid before the British\r\nGovernment by the commissioners employed during the last season\r\nto survey the territory in dispute between the two countries, and\r\ncommunicating the consent of Her Britannic Majesty's Government to the\r\ntwo principles which form the main foundation of the counter proposition\r\nof the United States for the adjustment of the question.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned, having laid Mr. Fox's note before the President, is\r\ninstructed to say in answer that the President duly appreciates the\r\nmotives of courtesy which prompted the British Government to communicate\r\nto that of the United States the documents referred to, and that he\r\nderives great satisfaction from the announcement that Her Majesty's\r\nGovernment do not relinquish the hope that the sincere desire which is\r\nfelt by both parties to arrive at an amicable settlement will at length\r\nbe attended with success, and from the prospect held out by Mr. Fox of\r\nhis being accordingly furnished by an early opportunity with the draft\r\nof a proposition amended in conformity with the principles to which Her\r\nMajesty's Government has acceded, to be submitted to the consideration\r\nof this Government.\r\n\r\nMr. Fox states that his Government might have expected that when the\r\nAmerican counter draft was communicated to him some reasons would have\r\nbeen given to explain why the United States Government declined\r\naccepting the British draft of convention, or that if it thought the\r\ndraft was not in conformity with previous agreement it would have\r\npointed out in what respect the two were considered to differ.\r\n\r\nIn the note which the undersigned addressed to Mr. Fox on the 29th July\r\nof last year, transmitting the American counter draft, he stated that in\r\nconsequence of the then recent events on the frontier and the danger of\r\ncollision between the citizens and subjects of the two Governments a\r\nmere commission of exploration and survey would be inadequate to the\r\nexigencies of the occasion and fall behind the just expectations of the\r\npeople of both countries, and referred to the importance of having the\r\nmeasure next adopted bear upon its face stipulations which must result\r\nin a final settlement under some form and in a reasonable time. These\r\nwere the reasons which induced the President to introduce in the new\r\nproject the provisions which he thought calculated for the attainment\r\nof so desirable an object, and which in his opinion rendered obviously\r\nunnecessary any allusion to the previous agreements referred to by Mr.\r\nFox. The President is gratified to find that a concurrence in those\r\nviews has brought the minds of Her Majesty's Government to a similar\r\nconclusion, and from this fresh indication of harmony in the wishes of\r\nthe two cabinets he permits himself to anticipate the most satisfactory\r\nresult from the measure under consideration.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned avails himself of the opportunity to offer to Mr. Fox\r\nrenewed assurances of his distinguished consideration.\r\n\r\nJOHN FORSYTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _June 29, 1840_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit, in answer to a resolution of the Senate of the 12th of March\r\nlast, a communication of the Secretary of War, accompanied by such\r\ninformation as could be obtained in relation to the military and naval\r\npreparations of the British authorities on the northern frontier of the\r\nUnited States from Lake Superior to the Atlantic Ocean.\r\n\r\nM.

POINSETT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY,\r\n\r\n_Washington, June 26, 1840_.\r\n\r\nThe SECRETARY OF WAR.\r\n\r\nSIR: I have the honor to report that in obedience to your instructions\r\nletters have been addressed to the various officers who it was supposed\r\nmight be able to procure the information required by the resolution of\r\nthe Senate of the 12th of March, to wit: \"_Resolved,_ That the President\r\nof the United States be requested to communicate to the Senate, if in\r\nhis judgment compatible with the public interest, any information which\r\nmaybe in possession of the Government, or which can be conveniently\r\nobtained, of the military and naval preparations of the British\r\nauthorities on the northern frontier of the United States from Lake\r\nSuperior to the Atlantic Ocean, distinguishing the permanent from the\r\ntemporary and field works, and particularly by noting those which are\r\nwithin the claimed limits of the United States.\" In answer to the letter\r\naddressed to him on the subject, and with regard to the Senate's\r\nresolution as far as relates to \"military preparations of the British\r\nauthorities on the northern frontier of the United States,\" General\r\nScott communicates the following facts: That he has paid but little\r\nattention to the forts and barracks erected by the British authorities\r\nnear the borders of Maine _above_ Frederickton, in New Brunswick, or in\r\nUpper Canada _above_ Cornwall, being of the fixed opinion that all such\r\nstructures would be of little or no military value to either of the\r\nparties in the event of a new war between the United States and Great\r\nBritain; that he was last summer at the foot of Lake Superior, and\r\nneither saw nor heard of any British fort or barracks on the St. Marys\r\nRiver; that between Lakes Huron and Brie the British have three sets of\r\nbarracks--one at Windsor, opposite to Detroit; one at Sandwich, a little\r\nlower down; and the third at Malden, 18 miles below the first--all built\r\nof sawed logs, strengthened by blockhouses, loopholes, etc.; that Malden\r\nhas long been a military post, with slight defenses; these have been\r\nrecently strengthened. The works at Sandwich and Windsor have also,\r\nhe thinks, been erected within the last six or eight months. That near\r\nthe mouth of the Niagara the British have two small forts--George and\r\nMississauga; both existed during the last war; the latter may be termed\r\na permanent work. Slight barracks have been erected within the last two\r\nyears on the same side near the Falls and at Chippewa, with breastworks\r\nat the latter place, but nothing, he believes, above the work first\r\nnamed on the Niagara which can be termed a fort.\r\n\r\nThat since the commencement of recent troubles and (consequent thereon)\r\nwithin our own limits Fort William Henry, at Kingston, and Fort\r\nWellington, opposite to Ogdensburg (old works), have both been\r\nstrengthened within themselves, besides the addition of dependencies.\r\nThese forts may be called permanent. That on the St. Lawrence below\r\nPrescott, and confronting our territory, he knows of no other military\r\npost. Twelve miles above, at Brockville, there may be temporary barracks\r\nand breastworks; that he knows that of late Brockville has been a\r\nmilitary station.\r\n\r\nThat in the system of defenses on the approaches to Montreal the Isle\r\naux Noix, a few miles below our line, and in the outlet of Lake\r\nChamplain, stands at the head. This island contains within itself\r\na system of permanent works of great strength; on them the British\r\nGovernment has from time to time expended much skill and labor.\r\n\r\nThat Odletown, near our line, on the western side of Lake Champlain,\r\nhas been a station for a body of Canadian militia for two years,\r\nto guard the neighborhood from refugee incendiaries from our side.\r\nHe thinks that barracks have been erected there for the accommodation of\r\nthose troops, and also at a station, with the like object, near Alburgh,\r\nVt. He believes that there are no important British forts or extensive\r\nBritish barracks on our borders from Vermont to Maine. In respect to\r\nsuch structures on the disputed territory, that Governor Fairfield's\r\npublished letters contain fuller information than has reached him\r\nthrough any other channel; that he has heard of no new military\r\npreparations by the British authorities on the St. Croix or\r\nPassamaquoddy Bay.\r\n\r\nThat among such preparations, perhaps he ought not to omit the fact\r\nthat Great Britain, besides numerous corps of well-organized and\r\nwell-instructed militia, has at this time within her North American\r\nProvinces more than 20,000 of her best regular troops. The whole of\r\nthose forces might be brought to the verge of our territory in a few\r\ndays. Two-thirds of that regular force has arrived out since the spring\r\nof 1838. General Scott states that he has had the honor to report\r\ndirectly to the Secretary of War with regard to the naval force recently\r\nmaintained upon the American lakes by Great Britain. In answer to a\r\nsimilar letter to that addressed to General Scott, General Brady writes\r\nfrom Detroit that the only permanent work of which he has any knowledge\r\nis the one at Fort Malden, which has in the last year been thoroughly\r\nrepaired, and good substantial barracks of wood have been erected within\r\nthe works, sufficient, he thinks, to contain six if not eight hundred\r\nmen; that the timber on the island of Bois Blanc has been partly taken\r\noff and three small blockhouses erected on the island. These are all the\r\nmilitary improvements he knows of between the mouth of Detroit River and\r\nthe outlet of Lake Superior. That temporary barracks of wood capable of\r\ncontaining perhaps 150 men have been erected opposite to Detroit; that\r\nsome British militia are stationed along the St. Clair River.\r\n\r\nColonel Bankhead writes that of the military and naval preparations of\r\nthe British on the northern frontier of the United States, he can only\r\nstate that Fort Mississauga, nearly opposite our Fort Niagara, has been\r\nenlarged and strengthened; that permanent and extensive barracks were\r\ncommenced last summer at Toronto and are probably completed by this\r\ntime, and that a large vessel for a steamer was being constructed last\r\nfall at Niagara City by and for the service of the Government; that\r\nthe British Government has on Lake Ontario a steamboat commanded and\r\nofficered by officers of the navy, and is commissioned, he presumes,\r\nas a Government vessel; that the authorities of Upper Canada had last\r\nsummer in their service on Lake Erie two steamboats, which were at first\r\nhired from citizens of Buffalo, but which they subsequently purchased,\r\nas he was informed.\r\n\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Crane writes from Buffalo that the only military work\r\nin that vicinity undergoing repairs (within his knowledge) is Fort\r\nMississauga, at the mouth of the Niagara River, on the Canada side,\r\nwhich the English have been repairing and extending for two years past,\r\nand it is believed to be now in a very efficient state; that there have\r\nbeen rumors of armed steamers being built or building at Chippewa, but\r\non inquiry he could learn of none except the ordinary steamboats for the\r\nnavigation of the lakes. It has been said, however, that one is building\r\non Lake Ontario by the English, and intended for the revenue service,\r\nbut he does not know what truth there is in this statement.\r\n\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Pierce reports from Plattsburg that he has no\r\nknowledge of any military or naval preparations of the British\r\nauthorities on the line of frontier adjacent to his command, comprising\r\nwhat is generally called the Lake Champlain frontier, except the\r\nintroduction of troops at Odletown and Napierville, near the boundary\r\nline between New York and Canada, on the west side of the lake, and also\r\nthe establishment of a line of posts from Missisquoi Bay, on the east\r\nside of the lake, along and near to the Vermont frontier as far as the\r\nConnecticut River, the erection of a new barrack and fieldwork at St.\r\nJohn, and the repairs and armament of the Isle aux Noix, with increased\r\nforce at both of these posts; that none of the positions so occupied by\r\nBritish troops are within the claimed limits of the United States; that\r\nthese military preparations (it has been heretofore understood) have\r\nbeen made by the British authorities to suppress rebellion and\r\ninsurrection among the Canadian population.\r\n\r\nCaptain Johnson reports from Fort Brady that he has heard nothing on\r\nthe subject of the resolution but mere rumors, and that there is no\r\nappearance of any works going up anywhere on the Canada side of the\r\nSt. Marys River. The files of the Adjutant-General's Office have been\r\nexamined, but no further information has been elicited.\r\n\r\nRespectfully submitted,\r\n\r\nALEX.

VAN BUREN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHon. R.M. JOHNSON,\r\n\r\n_President of the Senate_.\r\n\r\nSIR: I transmit herewith to the Senate a statement from the Secretary of\r\nthe Navy of the transfers which have been made since the commencement of\r\nthe present year from different appropriations for the naval service to\r\nother appropriations for the same service, which had become necessary\r\nfor the public interests.\r\n\r\nThe law under which these transfers were made conveys no authority for\r\nrefunding the different amounts which may be transferred. On the\r\ncontrary, so soon as the appropriations for the year shall pass and the\r\nmeans be furnished for refunding these sums the repayments would be\r\nprohibited by the law of 3d March, 1809, in relation to general\r\ntransfers.\r\n\r\nSome authority to refund the amounts which may be transferred under\r\nthe law of 30th of June, 1834, seems so obviously indispensable to any\r\nbeneficial exercise of the power which it grants that its omission may\r\nbe presumed to have been accidental.\r\n\r\nThe subject is respectfully referred to the consideration of Congress\r\nfor such action as they may deem proper to accomplish the restoration of\r\nthese transfers, and thus confirm the original appropriations as they\r\nare established by Congress, instead of leaving their expenditure\r\ndiscretionary with the Executive.\r\n\r\nM.

VAN BUREN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOURTH ANNUAL MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 5, 1840_.\r\n\r\n_Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nOur devout gratitude is due to the Supreme Being for having graciously\r\ncontinued to our beloved country through the vicissitudes of another\r\nyear the invaluable blessings of health, plenty, and peace. Seldom\r\nhas this favored land been so generally exempted from the ravages of\r\ndisease or the labor of the husbandman more amply rewarded, and never\r\nbefore have our relations with other countries been placed on a more\r\nfavorable basis than that which they so happily occupy at this critical\r\nconjuncture in the affairs of the world. A rigid and persevering\r\nabstinence from all interference with the domestic and political\r\nrelations of other States, alike due to the genius and distinctive\r\ncharacter of our Government and to the principles by which it is\r\ndirected; a faithful observance in the management of our foreign\r\nrelations of the practice of speaking plainly, dealing justly, and\r\nrequiring truth and justice in return as the best conservatives of\r\nthe peace of nations; a strict impartiality in our manifestations of\r\nfriendship in the commercial privileges we concede and those we require\r\nfrom others--these, accompanied by a disposition as prompt to maintain\r\nin every emergency our own rights as we are from principle averse to the\r\ninvasion of those of others, have given to our country and Government a\r\nstanding in the great family of nations of which we have just cause to\r\nbe proud and the advantages of which are experienced by our citizens\r\nthroughout every portion of the earth to which their enterprising and\r\nadventurous spirit may carry them. Few, if any, remain insensible to\r\nthe value of our friendship or ignorant of the terms on which it can\r\nbe acquired and by which it can alone be preserved.\r\n\r\nA series of questions of long standing, difficult in their adjustment\r\nand important in their consequences, in which the rights of our citizens\r\nand the honor of the country were deeply involved, have in the course of\r\na few years (the most of them during the successful Administration of my\r\nimmediate predecessor) been brought to a satisfactory conclusion; and\r\nthe most important of those remaining are, I am happy to believe, in a\r\nfair way of being speedily and satisfactorily adjusted.\r\n\r\nWith all the powers of the world our relations are those of honorable\r\npeace. Since your adjournment nothing serious has occurred to interrupt\r\nor threaten this desirable harmony. If clouds have lowered above the\r\nother hemisphere, they have not cast their portentous shadows upon our\r\nhappy shores. Bound by no entangling alliances, yet linked by a common\r\nnature and interest with the other nations of mankind, our aspirations\r\nare for the preservation of peace, in whose solid and civilizing\r\ntriumphs all may participate with a generous emulation. Yet it behooves\r\nus to be prepared for any event and to be always ready to maintain those\r\njust and enlightened principles of national intercourse for which this\r\nGovernment has ever contended. In the shock of contending empires it\r\nis only by assuming a resolute bearing and clothing themselves with\r\ndefensive armor that neutral nations can maintain their independent\r\nrights.\r\n\r\nThe excitement which grew out of the territorial controversy between\r\nthe United States and Great Britain having in a great measure subsided,\r\nit is hoped that a favorable period is approaching for its final\r\nsettlement. Both Governments must now be convinced of the dangers with\r\nwhich the question is fraught, and it must be their desire, as it is\r\ntheir interest, that this perpetual cause of irritation should be\r\nremoved as speedily as practicable. In my last annual message you were\r\ninformed that the proposition for a commission of exploration and survey\r\npromised by Great Britain had been received, and that a counter project,\r\nincluding also a provision for the certain and final adjustment of\r\nthe limits in dispute, was then before the British Government for its\r\nconsideration. The answer of that Government, accompanied by additional\r\npropositions of its own, was received through its minister here since\r\nyour separation. These were promptly considered, such as were deemed\r\ncorrect in principle and consistent with a due regard to the just rights\r\nof the United States and of the State of Maine concurred in, and the\r\nreasons for dissenting from the residue, with an additional suggestion\r\non our part, communicated by the Secretary of State to Mr. Fox. That\r\nminister, not feeling himself sufficiently instructed upon some of the\r\npoints raised in the discussion, felt it to be his duty to refer the\r\nmatter to his own Government for its further decision. Having now been\r\nfor some time under its advisement, a speedy answer may be confidently\r\nexpected. From the character of the points still in difference and the\r\nundoubted disposition of both parties to bring the matter to an early\r\nconclusion, I look with entire confidence to a prompt and satisfactory\r\ntermination of the negotiation. Three commissioners were appointed\r\nshortly after the adjournment of Congress under the act of the last\r\nsession providing for the exploration and survey of the line which\r\nseparates the States of Maine and New Hampshire from the British\r\nProvinces. They have been actively employed until their progress was\r\ninterrupted by the inclemency of the season, and will resume their\r\nlabors as soon as practicable in the ensuing year.\r\n\r\nIt is understood that their respective examinations will throw new light\r\nupon the subject in controversy and serve to remove any erroneous\r\nimpressions which may have been made elsewhere prejudicial to the rights\r\nof the United States. It was, among other reasons, with a view of\r\npreventing the embarrassments which in our peculiar system of government\r\nimpede and complicate negotiations involving the territorial rights of a\r\nState that I thought it my duty, as you have been informed on a previous\r\noccasion, to propose to the British Government, through its minister at\r\nWashington, that early steps should be taken to adjust the points of\r\ndifference on the line of boundary from the entrance of Lake Superior to\r\nthe most northwestern point of the Lake of the Woods by the arbitration\r\nof a friendly power in conformity with the seventh article of the treaty\r\nof Ghent. No answer has yet been returned by the British Government to\r\nthis proposition.\r\n\r\nWith Austria, France, Prussia, Russia, and the remaining powers of\r\nEurope I am happy to inform you our relations continue to be of the most\r\nfriendly character. With Belgium a treaty of commerce and navigation,\r\nbased upon liberal principles of reciprocity and equality, was concluded\r\nin March last, and, having been ratified by the Belgian Government, will\r\nbe duly laid before the Senate. It is a subject of congratulation that\r\nit provides for the satisfactory adjustment of a long-standing question\r\nof controversy, thus removing the only obstacle which could obstruct the\r\nfriendly and mutually advantageous intercourse between the two nations.\r\nA messenger has been dispatched with the Hanoverian treaty to Berlin,\r\nwhere, according to stipulation, the ratifications are to be exchanged.\r\nI am happy to announce to you that after many delays and difficulties a\r\ntreaty of commerce and navigation between the United States and Portugal\r\nwas concluded and signed at Lisbon on the 26th of August last by the\r\nplenipotentiaries of the two Governments. Its stipulations are founded\r\nupon those principles of mutual liberality and advantage which the\r\nUnited States have always sought to make the basis of their intercourse\r\nwith foreign powers, and it is hoped they will tend to foster and\r\nstrengthen the commercial intercourse of the two countries.\r\n\r\nUnder the appropriation of the last session of Congress an agent has\r\nbeen sent to Germany for the purpose of promoting the interests of our\r\ntobacco trade.\r\n\r\nThe commissioners appointed under the convention for the adjustment\r\nof claims of citizens of the United States upon Mexico having met and\r\norganized at Washington in August last, the papers in the possession of\r\nthe Government relating to those claims were communicated to the board.\r\nThe claims not embraced by that convention are now the subject of\r\nnegotiation between the two Governments through the medium of our\r\nminister at Mexico.\r\n\r\nNothing has occurred to disturb the harmony of our relations with the\r\ndifferent Governments of South America. I regret, however, to be obliged\r\nto inform you that the claims of our citizens upon the late Republic of\r\nColombia have not yet been satisfied by the separate Governments into\r\nwhich it has been resolved.\r\n\r\nThe chargé d'affaires of Brazil having expressed the intention of\r\nhis Government not to prolong the treaty of 1828, it will cease to be\r\nobligatory upon either party on the 12th day of December, 1841, when the\r\nextensive commercial intercourse between the United States and that vast\r\nEmpire will no longer be regulated by express stipulations.\r\n\r\nIt affords me pleasure to communicate to you that the Government of\r\nChili has entered into an agreement to indemnify the claimants in the\r\ncase of the _Macedonian_ for American property seized in 1819, and to\r\nadd that information has also been received which justifies the hope of\r\nan early adjustment of the remaining claims upon that Government.\r\n\r\nThe commissioners appointed in pursuance of the convention between the\r\nUnited States and Texas for marking the boundary between them have,\r\naccording to the last report received from our commissioner, surveyed\r\nand established the whole extent of the boundary north along the western\r\nbank of the Sabine River from its entrance into the Gulf of Mexico to\r\nthe thirty-second degree of north latitude. The commission adjourned\r\non the 16th of June last, to reassemble on the 1st of November for the\r\npurpose of establishing accurately the intersection of the thirty-second\r\ndegree of latitude with the western bank of the Sabine and the meridian\r\nline thence to Red River. It is presumed that the work will be concluded\r\nin the present season.\r\n\r\nThe present sound condition of their finances and the success with which\r\nembarrassments in regard to them, at times apparently insurmountable,\r\nhave been overcome are matters upon which the people and Government of\r\nthe United States may well congratulate themselves. An overflowing\r\nTreasury, however it may be regarded as an evidence of public\r\nprosperity, is seldom conducive to the permanent welfare of any people,\r\nand experience has demonstrated its incompatibility with the salutary\r\naction of political institutions like those of the United States. Our\r\nsafest reliance for financial efficiency and independence has, on the\r\ncontrary, been found to consist in ample resources unencumbered with\r\ndebt, and in this respect the Federal Government occupies a singularly\r\nfortunate and truly enviable position.\r\n\r\nWhen I entered upon the discharge of my official duties in March, 1837,\r\nthe act for the distribution of the surplus revenue was in a course\r\nof rapid execution. Nearly $28,000,000 of the public moneys were, in\r\npursuance of its provisions, deposited with the States in the months of\r\nJanuary, April, and July of that year. In May there occurred a general\r\nsuspension of specie payments by the banks, including, with very few\r\nexceptions, those in which the public moneys were deposited and upon\r\nwhose fidelity the Government had unfortunately made itself dependent\r\nfor the revenues which had been collected from the people and were\r\nindispensable to the public service.\r\n\r\nThis suspension and the excesses in banking and commerce out of which it\r\narose, and which were greatly aggravated by its occurrence, made to a\r\ngreat extent unavailable the principal part of the public money then on\r\nhand, suspended the collection of many millions accruing on merchants'\r\nbonds, and greatly reduced the revenue arising from customs and the\r\npublic lands. These effects have continued to operate in various degrees\r\nto the present period, and in addition to the decrease in the revenue\r\nthus produced two and a half millions of duties have been relinquished\r\nby two biennial reductions under the act of 1833, and probably as much\r\nmore upon the importation of iron for railroads by special legislation.\r\n\r\nWhilst such has been our condition for the last four years in relation\r\nto revenue, we have during the same period been subjected to an\r\nunavoidable continuance of large extraordinary expenses necessarily\r\ngrowing out of past transactions, and which could not be immediately\r\narrested without great prejudice to the public interest. Of these, the\r\ncharge upon the Treasury in consequence of the Cherokee treaty alone,\r\nwithout adverting to others arising out of Indian treaties, has already\r\nexceeded $5,000,000; that for the prosecution of measures for the\r\nremoval of the Seminole Indians, which were found in progress, has been\r\nnearly fourteen millions, and the public buildings have required the\r\nunusual sum of nearly three millions.\r\n\r\nIt affords me, however, great pleasure to be able to say that from\r\nthe commencement of this period to the present day every demand upon\r\nthe Government, at home or abroad, has been promptly met. This has\r\nbeen done not only without creating a permanent debt or a resort to\r\nadditional taxation in any form, but in the midst of a steadily\r\nprogressive reduction of existing burdens upon the people, leaving\r\nstill a considerable balance of available funds which will remain in\r\nthe Treasury at the end of the year. The small amount of Treasury notes,\r\nnot exceeding $4,500,000, still outstanding, and less by twenty-three\r\nmillions than the United States have in deposit with the States, is\r\ncomposed of such only as are not yet due or have not been presented\r\nfor payment. They may be redeemed out of the accruing revenue if the\r\nexpenditures do not exceed the amount within which they may, it is\r\nthought, be kept without prejudice to the public interest, and the\r\nrevenue shall prove to be as large as may justly be anticipated.\r\n\r\nAmong the reflections arising from the contemplation of these\r\ncircumstances, one, not the least gratifying, is the consciousness that\r\nthe Government had the resolution and the ability to adhere in every\r\nemergency to the sacred obligations of law, to execute all its contracts\r\naccording to the requirements of the Constitution, and thus to present\r\nwhen most needed a rallying point by which the business of the whole\r\ncountry might be brought back to a safe and unvarying standard--a result\r\nvitally important as well to the interests as to the morals of the\r\npeople. There can surely now be no difference of opinion in regard\r\nto the incalculable evils that would have arisen if the Government at\r\nthat critical moment had suffered itself to be deterred from upholding\r\nthe only true standard of value, either by the pressure of adverse\r\ncircumstances or the violence of unmerited denunciation. The manner\r\nin which the people sustained the performance of this duty was highly\r\nhonorable to their fortitude and patriotism. It can not fail to\r\nstimulate their agents to adhere under all circumstances to the line of\r\nduty and to satisfy them of the safety with which a course really right\r\nand demanded by a financial crisis may in a community like ours be\r\npursued, however apparently severe its immediate operation.\r\n\r\nThe policy of the Federal Government in extinguishing as rapidly as\r\npossible the national debt, and subsequently in resisting every\r\ntemptation to create a new one, deserves to be regarded in the same\r\nfavorable light. Among the many objections to a national debt, the\r\ncertain tendency of public securities to concentrate ultimately in the\r\ncoffers of foreign stockholders is one which is every day gathering\r\nstrength. Already have the resources of many of the States and the\r\nfuture industry of their citizens been indefinitely mortgaged to the\r\nsubjects of European Governments to the amount of twelve millions\r\nannually to pay the constantly accruing interest on borrowed money--a\r\nsum exceeding half the ordinary revenues of the whole United States.\r\nThe pretext which this relation affords to foreigners to scrutinize the\r\nmanagement of our domestic affairs, if not actually to intermeddle with\r\nthem, presents a subject for earnest attention, not to say of serious\r\nalarm. Fortunately, the Federal Government, with the exception of an\r\nobligation entered into in behalf of the District of Columbia, which\r\nmust soon be discharged, is wholly exempt from any such embarrassment.\r\nIt is also, as is believed, the only Government which, having fully and\r\nfaithfully paid all its creditors, has also relieved itself entirely\r\nfrom debt. To maintain a distinction so desirable and so honorable to\r\nour national character should be an object of earnest solicitude. Never\r\nshould a free people, if it be possible to avoid it, expose themselves\r\nto the necessity of having to treat of the peace, the honor, or the\r\nsafety of the Republic with the governments of foreign creditors, who,\r\nhowever well disposed they may be to cultivate with us in general\r\nfriendly relations, are nevertheless by the law of their own condition\r\nmade hostile to the success and permanency of political institutions\r\nlike ours. Most humiliating may be the embarrassments consequent upon\r\nsuch a condition. Another objection, scarcely less formidable, to the\r\ncommencement of a new debt is its inevitable tendency to increase in\r\nmagnitude and to foster national extravagance. He has been an\r\nunprofitable observer of events who needs at this day to be admonished\r\nof the difficulties which a government habitually dependent on loans\r\nto sustain its ordinary expenditures has to encounter in resisting\r\nthe influences constantly exerted in favor of additional loans; by\r\ncapitalists, who enrich themselves by government securities for amounts\r\nmuch exceeding the money they actually advance--a prolific source of\r\nindividual aggrandizement in all borrowing countries; by stockholders,\r\nwho seek their gains in the rise and fall of public stocks; and by\r\nthe selfish importunities of applicants for appropriations for works\r\navowedly for the accommodation of the public, but the real objects of\r\nwhich are too frequently the advancement of private interests. The known\r\nnecessity which so many of the States will be under to impose taxes\r\nfor the payment of the interest on their debts furnishes an additional\r\nand very cogent reason why the Federal Government should refrain from\r\ncreating a national debt, by which the people would be exposed to\r\ndouble taxation for a similar object. We possess within ourselves\r\nample resources for every emergency, and we may be quite sure that\r\nour citizens in no future exigency will be unwilling to supply the\r\nGovernment with all the means asked for the defense of the country.\r\nIn time of peace there can, at all events, be no justification for the\r\ncreation of a permanent debt by the Federal Government. Its limited\r\nrange of constitutional duties may certainly under such circumstances be\r\nperformed without such a resort. It has, it is seen, been avoided during\r\nfour years of greater fiscal difficulties than have existed in a similar\r\nperiod since the adoption of the Constitution, and one also remarkable\r\nfor the occurrence of extraordinary causes of expenditures.\r\n\r\nBut to accomplish so desirable an object two things are indispensable:\r\nFirst, that the action of the Federal Government be kept within\r\nthe boundaries prescribed by its founders, and, secondly, that all\r\nappropriations for objects admitted to be constitutional, and the\r\nexpenditure of them also, be subjected to a standard of rigid but\r\nwell-considered and practical economy. The first depends chiefly on\r\nthe people themselves--the opinions they form of the true construction\r\nof the Constitution and the confidence they repose in the political\r\nsentiments of those they select as their representatives in the Federal\r\nLegislature; the second rests upon the fidelity with which their more\r\nimmediate representatives and other public functionaries discharge the\r\ntrusts committed to them. The duty of economizing the expenses of the\r\npublic service is admitted on all hands; yet there are few subjects upon\r\nwhich there exists a wider difference of opinion than is constantly\r\nmanifested in regard to the fidelity with which that duty is discharged.\r\nNeither diversity of sentiment nor even mutual recriminations upon a\r\npoint in respect to which the public mind is so justly sensitive can\r\nwell be entirely avoided, and least so at periods of great political\r\nexcitement. An intelligent people, however, seldom fail to arrive in the\r\nend at correct conclusions in such a matter. Practical economy in the\r\nmanagement of public affairs can have no adverse influence to contend\r\nwith more powerful than a large surplus revenue, and the unusually\r\nlarge appropriations for 1837 may without doubt, independently of the\r\nextraordinary requisitions for the public service growing out of the\r\nstate of our Indian relations, be in no inconsiderable degree traced\r\nto this source. The sudden and rapid distribution of the large surplus\r\nthen in the Treasury and the equally sudden and unprecedentedly severe\r\nrevulsion in the commerce and business of the country, pointing with\r\nunerring certainty to a great and protracted reduction of the revenue,\r\nstrengthened the propriety of the earliest practicable reduction of the\r\npublic expenditures.\r\n\r\nBut to change a system operating upon so large a surface and applicable\r\nto such numerous and diversified interests and objects was more than the\r\nwork of a day. The attention of every department of the Government was\r\nimmediately and in good faith directed to that end, and has been so\r\ncontinued to the present moment. The estimates and appropriations for\r\nthe year 1838 (the first over which I had any control) were somewhat\r\ndiminished. The expenditures of 1839 were reduced $6,000,000. Those of\r\n1840, exclusive of disbursements for public debt and trust claims, will\r\nprobably not exceed twenty-two and a half millions, being between two\r\nand three millions less than those of the preceding year and nine or\r\nten millions less than those of 1837. Nor has it been found necessary\r\nin order to produce this result to resort to the power conferred by\r\nCongress of postponing certain classes of the public works, except by\r\ndeferring expenditures for a short period upon a limited portion of\r\nthem, and which postponement terminated some time since--at the moment\r\nthe Treasury Department by further receipts from the indebted banks\r\nbecame fully assured of its ability to meet them without prejudice to\r\nthe public service in other respects. Causes are in operation which\r\nwill, it is believed, justify a still further reduction, without injury\r\nto any important national interest. The expenses of sustaining the\r\ntroops employed in Florida have been gradually and greatly reduced\r\nthrough the persevering efforts of the War Department, and a reasonable\r\nhope may be entertained that the necessity for military operations in\r\nthat quarter will soon cease. The removal of the Indians from within\r\nour settled borders is nearly completed. The pension list, one of the\r\nheaviest charges upon the Treasury, is rapidly diminishing by death.\r\nThe most costly of our public buildings are either finished or nearly\r\nso, and we may, I think, safely promise ourselves a continued exemption\r\nfrom border difficulties.\r\n\r\nThe available balance in the Treasury on the 1st of January next is\r\nestimated at $1,500,000. This sum, with the expected receipts from all\r\nsources during the next year, will, it is believed, be sufficient to\r\nenable the Government to meet every engagement and have a suitable\r\nbalance in the Treasury at the end of the year, if the remedial measures\r\nconnected with the customs and the public lands heretofore recommended\r\nare adopted and the new appropriations by Congress shall not carry the\r\nexpenditures beyond the official estimates.\r\n\r\nThe new system established by Congress for the safe-keeping of the\r\npublic money, prescribing the kind of currency to be received for the\r\npublic revenue and providing additional guards and securities against\r\nlosses, has now been several months in operation. Although it might be\r\npremature upon an experience of such limited duration to form a definite\r\nopinion in regard to the extent of its influences in correcting many\r\nevils under which the Federal Government and the country have hitherto\r\nsuffered, especially those that have grown out of banking expansions, a\r\ndepreciated currency, and official defalcations, yet it is but right to\r\nsay that nothing has occurred in the practical operation of the system\r\nto weaken in the slightest degree, but much to strengthen, the confident\r\nanticipations of its friends. The grounds of these have been heretofore\r\nso fully explained as to require no recapitulation. In respect to the\r\nfacility and convenience it affords in conducting the public service,\r\nand the ability of the Government to discharge through its agency every\r\nduty attendant on the collection, transfer, and disbursement of the\r\npublic money with promptitude and success, I can say with confidence\r\nthat the apprehensions of those who felt it to be their duty to oppose\r\nits adoption have proved to be unfounded. On the contrary, this branch\r\nof the fiscal affairs of the Government has been, and it is believed may\r\nalways be, thus carried on with every desirable facility and security.\r\nA few changes and improvements in the details of the system, without\r\naffecting any principles involved in it, will be submitted to you by the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury, and will, I am sure, receive at your hands\r\nthat attention to which they may on examination be found to be entitled.\r\n\r\nI have deemed this brief summary of our fiscal affairs necessary\r\nto the due performance of a duty specially enjoined upon me by the\r\nConstitution. It will serve also to illustrate more fully the principles\r\nby which I have been guided in reference to two contested points in our\r\npublic policy which were earliest in their development and have been\r\nmore important in their consequences than any that have arisen under\r\nour complicated and difficult, yet admirable, system of government.\r\nI allude to a national debt and a national bank. It was in these that the\r\npolitical contests by which the country has been agitated ever since the\r\nadoption of the Constitution in a great measure originated, and there is\r\ntoo much reason to apprehend that the conflicting interests and opposing\r\nprinciples thus marshaled will continue as heretofore to produce similar\r\nif not aggravated consequences.\r\n\r\nComing into office the declared enemy of both, I have earnestly\r\nendeavored to prevent a resort to either.\r\n\r\nThe consideration that a large public debt affords an apology, and\r\nproduces in some degree a necessity also, for resorting to a system\r\nand extent of taxation which is not only oppressive throughout, but is\r\nlikewise so apt to lead in the end to the commission of that most odious\r\nof all offenses against the principles of republican government, the\r\nprostitution of political power, conferred for the general benefit,\r\nto the aggrandizement of particular classes and the gratification of\r\nindividual cupidity, is alone sufficient, independently of the weighty\r\nobjections which have already been urged, to render its creation and\r\nexistence the sources of bitter and unappeasable discord. If we add\r\nto this its inevitable tendency to produce and foster extravagant\r\nexpenditures of the public moneys, by which a necessity is created for\r\nnew loans and new burdens on the people, and, finally, refer to the\r\nexamples of every government which has existed for proof, how seldom it\r\nis that the system, when once adopted and implanted in the policy of a\r\ncountry, has failed to expand itself until public credit was exhausted\r\nand the people were no longer able to endure its increasing weight, it\r\nseems impossible to resist the conclusion that no benefits resulting\r\nfrom its career, no extent of conquest, no accession of wealth to\r\nparticular classes, nor any nor all its combined advantages, can\r\ncounterbalance its ultimate but certain results--a splendid government\r\nand an impoverished people.\r\n\r\nIf a national bank was, as is undeniable, repudiated by the framers of\r\nthe Constitution as incompatible with the rights of the States and the\r\nliberties of the people; if from the beginning it has been regarded by\r\nlarge portions of our citizens as coming in direct collision with that\r\ngreat and vital amendment of the Constitution which declares that all\r\npowers not conferred by that instrument on the General Government are\r\nreserved to the States and to the people; if it has been viewed by them\r\nas the first great step in the march of latitudinous construction, which\r\nunchecked would render that sacred instrument of as little value as an\r\nunwritten constitution, dependent, as it would alone be, for its meaning\r\non the interested interpretation of a dominant party, and affording no\r\nsecurity to the rights of the minority--if such is undeniably the case,\r\nwhat rational grounds could have been conceived for anticipating aught\r\nbut determined opposition to such an institution at the present day.\r\n\r\nCould a different result have been expected when the consequences which\r\nhave flowed from its creation, and particularly from its struggles to\r\nperpetuate its existence, had confirmed in so striking a manner the\r\napprehensions of its earliest opponents; when it had been so clearly\r\ndemonstrated that a concentrated money power, wielding so vast a capital\r\nand combining such incalculable means of influence, may in those\r\npeculiar conjunctures to which this Government is unavoidably exposed\r\nprove an overmatch for the political power of the people themselves;\r\nwhen the true character of its capacity to regulate according to its\r\nwill and its interests and the interests of its favorites the value and\r\nproduction of the labor and property of every man in this extended\r\ncountry had been so fully and fearfully developed; when it was notorious\r\nthat all classes of this great community had, by means of the power and\r\ninfluence it thus possesses, been infected to madness with a spirit of\r\nheedless speculation; when it had been seen that, secure in the support\r\nof the combination of influences by which it was surrounded, it could\r\nviolate its charter and set the laws at defiance with impunity; and\r\nwhen, too, it had become most apparent that to believe that such an\r\naccumulation of powers can ever be granted without the certainty of\r\nbeing abused was to indulge in a fatal delusion?\r\n\r\nTo avoid the necessity of a permanent debt and its inevitable\r\nconsequences I have advocated and endeavored to carry into effect the\r\npolicy of confining the appropriations for the public service to such\r\nobjects only as are clearly within the constitutional authority of the\r\nFederal Government; of excluding from its expenses those improvident and\r\nunauthorized grants of public money for works of internal improvement\r\nwhich were so wisely arrested by the constitutional interposition of my\r\npredecessor, and which, if they had not been so checked, would long\r\nbefore this time have involved the finances of the General Government\r\nin embarrassments far greater than those which are now experienced by\r\nany of the States; of limiting all our expenditures to that simple,\r\nunostentatious, and economical administration of public affairs which is\r\nalone consistent with the character of our institutions; of collecting\r\nannually from the customs, and the sales of public lands a revenue fully\r\nadequate to defray all the expenses thus incurred; but under no pretense\r\nwhatsoever to impose taxes upon the people to a greater amount than was\r\nactually necessary to the public service conducted upon the principles\r\nI have stated.\r\n\r\nIn lieu of a national bank or a dependence upon banks of any\r\ndescription for the management of our fiscal affairs, I recommended\r\nthe adoption of the system which is now in successful operation.\r\nThat system affords every requisite facility for the transaction of\r\nthe pecuniary concerns of the Government; will, it is confidently\r\nanticipated, produce in other respects many of the benefits which have\r\nbeen from time to time expected from the creation of a national bank,\r\nbut which have never been realized; avoid the manifold evils inseparable\r\nfrom such an institution; diminish to a greater extent than could be\r\naccomplished by any other measure of reform the patronage of the Federal\r\nGovernment--a wise policy in all governments, but more especially so in\r\none like ours, which works well only in proportion as it is made to rely\r\nfor its support upon the unbiased and unadulterated opinions of its\r\nconstituents; do away forever all dependence on corporate bodies either\r\nin the raising, collecting, safekeeping, or disbursing the public\r\nrevenues, and place the Government equally above the temptation of\r\nfostering a dangerous and unconstitutional institution at home or the\r\nnecessity of adapting its policy to the views and interests of a still\r\nmore formidable money power abroad.\r\n\r\nIt is by adopting and carrying out these principles under circumstances\r\nthe most arduous and discouraging that the attempt has been made, thus\r\nfar successfully, to demonstrate to the people of the United States that\r\na national bank at all times, and a national debt except it be incurred\r\nat a period when the honor and safety of the nation demand the temporary\r\nsacrifice of a policy which should only be abandoned in such exigencies,\r\nare not merely unnecessary, but in direct and deadly hostility to the\r\nprinciples of their Government and to their own permanent welfare.\r\n\r\nThe progress made in the development of these positions appears in the\r\npreceding sketch of the past history and present state of the financial\r\nconcerns of the Federal Government. The facts there stated fully\r\nauthorize the assertion that all the purposes for which this Government\r\nwas instituted have been accomplished during four years of greater\r\npecuniary embarrassment than were ever before experienced in time of\r\npeace, and in the face of opposition as formidable as any that was ever\r\nbefore arrayed against the policy of an Administration; that this has\r\nbeen done when the ordinary revenues of the Government were generally\r\ndecreasing as well from the operation of the laws as the condition\r\nof the country, without the creation of a permanent public debt or\r\nincurring any liability other than such as the ordinary resources of\r\nthe Government will speedily discharge, and without the agency of a\r\nnational bank.\r\n\r\nIf this view of the proceedings of the Government for the period it\r\nembraces be warranted by the facts as they are known to exist; if the\r\nArmy and Navy have been sustained to the full extent authorized by law,\r\nand which Congress deemed sufficient for the defense of the country and\r\nthe protection of its rights and its honor; if its civil and diplomatic\r\nservice has been equally sustained; if ample provision has been made for\r\nthe administration of justice and the execution of the laws; if the\r\nclaims upon public gratitude in behalf of the soldiers of the Revolution\r\nhave been promptly met and faithfully discharged; if there have been no\r\nfailures in defraying the very large expenditures growing out of that\r\nlong-continued and salutary policy of peacefully removing the Indians to\r\nregions of comparative safety and prosperity; if the public faith has at\r\nall times and everywhere been most scrupulously maintained by a prompt\r\ndischarge of the numerous, extended, and diversified claims on the\r\nTreasury--if all these great and permanent objects, with many others\r\nthat might be stated, have for a series of years, marked by peculiar\r\nobstacles and difficulties, been successfully accomplished without a\r\nresort to a permanent debt or the aid of a national bank, have we not\r\na right to expect that a policy the object of which has been to sustain\r\nthe public service independently of either of these fruitful sources of\r\ndiscord will receive the final sanction of a people whose unbiased and\r\nfairly elicited judgment upon public affairs is never ultimately wrong?\r\n\r\nThat embarrassments in the pecuniary concerns of individuals of\r\nunexampled extent and duration have recently existed in this as in other\r\ncommercial nations is undoubtedly true. To suppose it necessary now\r\nto trace these reverses to their sources would be a reflection on the\r\nintelligence of my fellow-citizens. Whatever may have been the obscurity\r\nin which the subject was involved during the earlier stages of the\r\nrevulsion, there can not now be many by whom the whole question is not\r\nfully understood.\r\n\r\nNot deeming it within the constitutional powers of the General\r\nGovernment to repair private losses sustained by reverses in business\r\nhaving no connection with the public service, either by direct\r\nappropriations from the Treasury or by special legislation designed to\r\nsecure exclusive privileges and immunities to individuals or classes\r\nin preference to or at the expense of the great majority necessarily\r\ndebarred from any participation in them, no attempt to do so has been\r\neither made, recommended, or encouraged by the present Executive.\r\n\r\nIt is believed, however, that the great purposes for the attainment of\r\nwhich the Federal Government was instituted have not been lost sight\r\nof. Intrusted only with certain limited powers, cautiously enumerated,\r\ndistinctly specified, and defined with a precision and clearness which\r\nwould seem to defy misconstruction, it has been my constant aim to\r\nconfine myself within the limits so clearly marked out and so carefully\r\nguarded. Having always been of opinion that the best preservative of\r\nthe union of the States is to be found in a total abstinence from the\r\nexercise of all doubtful powers on the part of the Federal Government\r\nrather than in attempts to assume them by a loose construction of the\r\nConstitution or an ingenious perversion of its words, I have endeavored\r\nto avoid recommending any measure which I had reason to apprehend would,\r\nin the opinion even of a considerable minority of my fellow-citizens, be\r\nregarded as trenching on the rights of the States or the provisions of\r\nthe hallowed instrument of our Union. Viewing the aggregate powers of\r\nthe Federal Government as a voluntary concession of the States, it\r\nseemed to me that such only should be exercised as were at the time\r\nintended to be given.\r\n\r\nI have been strengthened, too, in the propriety of this course by the\r\nconviction that all efforts to go beyond this tend only to produce\r\ndissatisfaction and distrust, to excite jealousies, and to provoke\r\nresistance. Instead of adding strength to the Federal Government, even\r\nwhen successful they must ever prove a source of incurable weakness by\r\nalienating a portion of those whose adhesion is indispensable to the\r\ngreat aggregate of united strength and whose voluntary attachment is\r\nin my estimation far more essential to the efficiency of a government\r\nstrong in the best of all possible strength--the confidence and\r\nattachment of all those who make up its constituent elements.\r\n\r\nThus believing, it has been my purpose to secure to the whole people and\r\nto every member of the Confederacy, by general, salutary, and equal laws\r\nalone, the benefit of those republican institutions which it was the end\r\nand aim of the Constitution to establish, and the impartial influence\r\nof which is in my judgment indispensable to their preservation. I can\r\nnot bring myself to believe that the lasting happiness of the people,\r\nthe prosperity of the States, or the permanency of their Union can be\r\nmaintained by giving preference or priority to any class of citizens\r\nin the distribution of benefits or privileges, or by the adoption\r\nof measures which enrich one portion of the Union at the expense of\r\nanother; nor can I see in the interference of the Federal Government\r\nwith the local legislation and reserved rights of the States a remedy\r\nfor present or a security against future dangers.\r\n\r\nThe first, and assuredly not the least, important step toward relieving\r\nthe country from the condition into which it had been plunged by\r\nexcesses in trade, banking, and credits of all kinds was to place the\r\nbusiness transactions of the Government itself on a solid basis, giving\r\nand receiving in all cases value for value, and neither countenancing\r\nnor encouraging in others that delusive system of credits from which it\r\nhas been found so difficult to escape, and which has left nothing behind\r\nit but the wrecks that mark its fatal career.\r\n\r\nThat the financial affairs of the Government are now and have been\r\nduring the whole period of these wide-spreading difficulties conducted\r\nwith a strict and invariable regard to this great fundamental principle,\r\nand that by the assumption and maintenance of the stand thus taken on\r\nthe very threshold of the approaching crisis more than by any other\r\ncause or causes whatever the community at large has been shielded from\r\nthe incalculable evils of a general and indefinite suspension of specie\r\npayments, and a consequent annihilation for the whole period it might\r\nhave lasted of a just and invariable standard of value, will, it is\r\nbelieved, at this period scarcely be questioned.\r\n\r\nA steady adherence on the part of the Government to the policy which has\r\nproduced such salutary results, aided by judicious State legislation\r\nand, what is not less important, by the industry, enterprise,\r\nperseverance, and economy of the American people, can not fail to raise\r\nthe whole country at an early period to a state of solid and enduring\r\nprosperity, not subject to be again overthrown by the suspension of\r\nbanks or the explosion of a bloated credit system. It is for the people\r\nand their representatives to decide whether or not the permanent welfare\r\nof the country (which all good citizens equally desire, however widely\r\nthey may differ as to the means of its accomplishment) shall be in this\r\nway secured, or whether the management of the pecuniary concerns of the\r\nGovernment, and by consequence to a great extent those of individuals\r\nalso, shall be carried back to a condition of things which fostered\r\nthose contractions and expansions of the currency and those reckless\r\nabuses of credit from the baleful effects of which the country has so\r\ndeeply suffered--a return that can promise in the end no better results\r\nthan to reproduce the embarrassments the Government has experienced, and\r\nto remove from the shoulders of the present to those of fresh victims\r\nthe bitter fruits of that spirit of speculative enterprise to which our\r\ncountrymen are so liable and upon which the lessons of experience are so\r\nunavailing. The choice is an important one, and I sincerely hope that it\r\nmay be wisely made.\r\n\r\nA report from the Secretary of War, presenting a detailed view of the\r\naffairs of that Department, accompanies this communication.\r\n\r\nThe desultory duties connected with the removal of the Indians, in\r\nwhich the Army has been constantly engaged on the northern and western\r\nfrontiers and in Florida, have rendered it impracticable to carry into\r\nfull effect the plan recommended by the Secretary for improving its\r\ndiscipline. In every instance where the regiments have been concentrated\r\nthey have made great progress, and the best results may be anticipated\r\nfrom a continuance of this system. During the last season a part of the\r\ntroops have been employed in removing Indians from the interior to the\r\nterritory assigned them in the West--a duty which they have performed\r\nefficiently and with praiseworthy humanity--and that portion of them\r\nwhich has been stationed in Florida continued active operations there\r\nthroughout the heats of summer.\r\n\r\nThe policy of the United States in regard to the Indians, of which a\r\nsuccinct account is given in my message of 1838, and of the wisdom and\r\nexpediency of which I am fully satisfied, has been continued in active\r\noperation throughout the whole period of my Administration. Since the\r\nspring of 1837 more than 40,000 Indians have been removed to their new\r\nhomes west of the Mississippi, and I am happy to add that all accounts\r\nconcur in representing the result of this measure as eminently\r\nbeneficial to that people.\r\n\r\nThe emigration of the Seminoles alone has been attended with serious\r\ndifficulty and occasioned bloodshed, hostilities having been commenced\r\nby the Indians in Florida under the apprehension that they would be\r\ncompelled by force to comply with their treaty stipulations. The\r\nexecution of the treaty of Paynes Landing, signed in 1832, but not\r\nratified until 1834, was postponed at the solicitation of the Indians\r\nuntil 1836, when they again renewed their agreement to remove peaceably\r\nto their new homes in the West. In the face of this solemn and renewed\r\ncompact they broke their faith and commenced hostilities by the massacre\r\nof Major Dade's command, the murder of their agent, General Thompson,\r\nand other acts of cruel treachery. When this alarming and unexpected\r\nintelligence reached the seat of Government, every effort appears to\r\nhave been made to reenforce General Clinch, who commanded the troops\r\nthen in Florida. General Eustis was dispatched with reenforcements from\r\nCharleston, troops were called out from Alabama, Tennessee, and Georgia,\r\nand General Scott was sent to take the command, with ample powers and\r\nample means. At the first alarm General Gaines organized a force at\r\nNew Orleans, and without waiting for orders landed in Florida, where\r\nhe delivered over the troops he had brought with him to General Scott.\r\n\r\nGovernor Call was subsequently appointed to conduct a summer campaign,\r\nand at the close of it was replaced by General Jesup. These events\r\nand changes took place under the Administration of my predecessor.\r\nNotwithstanding the exertions of the experienced officers who had\r\ncommand there for eighteen months, on entering upon the administration\r\nof the Government I found the Territory of Florida a prey to Indian\r\natrocities. A strenuous effort was immediately made to bring those\r\nhostilities to a close, and the army under General Jesup was reenforced\r\nuntil it amounted to 10,000 men, and furnished with abundant supplies\r\nof every description. In this campaign a great number of the enemy\r\nwere captured and destroyed, but the character of the contest only\r\nwas changed. The Indians, having been defeated in every engagement,\r\ndispersed in small bands throughout the country and became an\r\nenterprising, formidable, and ruthless banditti. General Taylor, who\r\nsucceeded General Jesup, used his best exertions to subdue them, and was\r\nseconded in his efforts by the officers under his command; but he too\r\nfailed to protect the Territory from their depredations. By an act\r\nof signal and cruel treachery they broke the truce made with them by\r\nGeneral Macomb, who was sent from Washington for the purpose of carrying\r\ninto effect the expressed wishes of Congress, and have continued their\r\ndevastations ever since. General Armistead, who was in Florida when\r\nGeneral Taylor left the army by permission, assumed the command, and\r\nafter active summer operations was met by propositions for peace, and\r\nfrom the fortunate coincidence of the arrival in Florida at the same\r\nperiod of a delegation from the Seminoles who are happily settled west\r\nof the Mississippi and are now anxious to persuade their countrymen to\r\njoin them there hopes were for some time entertained that the Indians\r\nmight be induced to leave the Territory without further difficulty.\r\nThese hopes have proved fallacious and hostilities have been renewed\r\nthroughout the whole of the Territory. That this contest has endured so\r\nlong is to be attributed to causes beyond the control of the Government.\r\nExperienced generals have had the command of the troops, officers and\r\nsoldiers have alike distinguished themselves for their activity,\r\npatience, and enduring courage, the army has been constantly furnished\r\nwith supplies of every description, and we must look for the causes\r\nwhich have so long procrastinated the issue of the contest in the\r\nvast extent of the theater of hostilities, the almost insurmountable\r\nobstacles presented by the nature of the country, the climate, and\r\nthe wily character of the savages.\r\n\r\nThe sites for marine hospitals on the rivers and lakes which I was\r\nauthorized to select and cause to be purchased have all been designated,\r\nbut the appropriation not proving sufficient, conditional arrangements\r\nonly have been made for their acquisition. It is for Congress to decide\r\nwhether these conditional purchases shall be sanctioned and the humane\r\nintentions of the law carried into full effect.\r\n\r\nThe Navy, as will appear from the accompanying report of the Secretary,\r\nhas been usefully and honorably employed in the protection of our\r\ncommerce and citizens in the Mediterranean, the Pacific, on the coast of\r\nBrazil, and in the Gulf of Mexico. A small squadron, consisting of the\r\nfrigate _Constellation_ and the sloop of war _Boston_, under Commodore\r\nKearney, is now on its way to the China and Indian seas for the purpose\r\nof attending to our interests in that quarter, and Commander Aulick, in\r\nthe sloop of war _Yorktown_, has been instructed to visit the Sandwich\r\nand Society islands, the coasts of New Zealand and Japan, together with\r\nother ports and islands frequented by our whale ships, for the purpose\r\nof giving them countenance and protection should they be required. Other\r\nsmaller vessels have been and still are employed in prosecuting the\r\nsurveys of the coast of the United States directed by various acts of\r\nCongress, and those which have been completed will shortly be laid\r\nbefore you.\r\n\r\nThe exploring expedition at the latest date was preparing to leave the\r\nBay of Islands, New Zealand, in further prosecution of objects which\r\nhave thus far been successfully accomplished. The discovery of a new\r\ncontinent, which was first seen in latitude 66° 2' south, longitude 154°\r\n27' east, and afterwards in latitude 66° 31' south, longitude 153° 40'\r\neast, by Lieutenants Wilkes and Hudson, for an extent of 1,800 miles,\r\nbut on which they were prevented from landing by vast bodies of ice\r\nwhich encompassed it, is one of the honorable results of the enterprise.\r\nLieutenant Wilkes bears testimony to the zeal and good conduct of his\r\nofficers and men, and it is but justice to that officer to state that\r\nhe appears to have performed the duties assigned him with an ardor,\r\nability, and perseverance which give every assurance of an honorable\r\nissue to the undertaking.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Postmaster-General herewith transmitted will exhibit\r\nthe service of that Department the past year and its present condition.\r\nThe transportation has been maintained during the year to the full\r\nextent authorized by the existing laws; some improvements have been\r\neffected which the public interest seemed urgently to demand, but not\r\ninvolving any material additional expenditure; the contractors have\r\ngenerally performed their engagements with fidelity; the postmasters,\r\nwith few exceptions, have rendered their accounts and paid their\r\nquarterly balances with promptitude, and the whole service of the\r\nDepartment has maintained the efficiency for which it has for several\r\nyears been distinguished.\r\n\r\nThe acts of Congress establishing new mail routes and requiring more\r\nexpensive services on others and the increasing wants of the country\r\nhave for three years past carried the expenditures something beyond the\r\naccruing revenues, the excess having been met until the past year by\r\nthe surplus which had previously accumulated. That surplus having been\r\nexhausted and the anticipated increase in the revenue not having been\r\nrealized owing to the depression in the commercial business of the\r\ncountry, the finances of the Department exhibit a small deficiency at\r\nthe close of the last fiscal year. Its resources, however, are ample,\r\nand the reduced rates of compensation for the transportation service\r\nwhich may be expected on the future lettings from the general reduction\r\nof prices, with the increase of revenue that may reasonably be\r\nanticipated from the revival of commercial activity, must soon place\r\nthe finances of the Department in a prosperous condition.\r\n\r\nConsidering the unfavorable circumstances which have existed during the\r\npast year, it is a gratifying result that the revenue has not declined\r\nas compared with the preceding year, but, on the contrary, exhibits a\r\nsmall increase, the circumstances referred to having had no other effect\r\nthan to check the expected income.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the Postmaster-General suggests certain\r\nimprovements in the establishment designed to reduce the weight of the\r\nmails, cheapen the transportation, insure greater regularity in the\r\nservice, and secure a considerable reduction in the rates of letter\r\npostage--an object highly desirable. The subject is one of general\r\ninterest to the community, and is respectfully recommended to your\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nThe suppression of the African slave trade has received the continued\r\nattention of the Government. The brig _Dolphin_ and schooner _Grampus_\r\nhave been employed during the last season on the coast of Africa for the\r\npurpose of preventing such portions of that trade as were said to be\r\nprosecuted under the American flag. After cruising off those parts of\r\nthe coast most usually resorted to by slavers until the commencement\r\nof the rainy season, these vessels returned to the United States for\r\nsupplies, and have since been dispatched on a similar service.\r\n\r\nFrom the reports of the commanding officers it appears that the trade is\r\nnow principally carried on under Portuguese colors, and they express the\r\nopinion that the apprehension of their presence on the slave coast has\r\nin a great degree arrested the prostitution of the American flag to this\r\ninhuman purpose. It is hoped that by continuing to maintain this force\r\nin that quarter and by the exertions of the officers in command much\r\nwill be done to put a stop to whatever portion of this traffic may have\r\nbeen carried on under the American flag and to prevent its use in a\r\ntrade which, while it violates the laws, is equally an outrage on the\r\nrights of others and the feelings of humanity. The efforts of the\r\nseveral Governments who are anxiously seeking to suppress this traffic\r\nmust, however, be directed against the facilities afforded by what are\r\nnow recognized as legitimate commercial pursuits before that object can\r\nbe fully accomplished.\r\n\r\nSupplies of provisions, water casks, merchandise, and articles connected\r\nwith the prosecution of the slave trade are, it is understood, freely\r\ncarried by vessels of different nations to the slave factories, and the\r\neffects of the factors are transported openly from one slave station to\r\nanother without interruption or punishment by either of the nations to\r\nwhich they belong engaged in the commerce of that region. I submit\r\nto your judgments whether this Government, having been the first to\r\nprohibit by adequate penalties the slave trade, the first to declare it\r\npiracy, should not be the first also to forbid to its citizens all trade\r\nwith the slave factories on the coast of Africa, giving an example to\r\nall nations in this respect which if fairly followed can not fail to\r\nproduce the most effective results in breaking up those dens of\r\niniquity.\r\n\r\nM.

POINSETT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, OFFICE INDIAN AFFAIRS,\r\n\r\n_December, 1840_.\r\n\r\nHon. J.R. POINSETT,\r\n\r\n_Secretary of War_.\r\n\r\nSIR: A compact was made on the 17th January, 1837, \"subject to the\r\napproval of the President and Senate of the United States,\" which it\r\nreceived from the former on the 24th March, 1837, in conformity with\r\nthe resolution of the Senate of 25th February, between the Choctaw and\r\nChickasaw tribes of Indians, of which I have the honor to inclose a copy.\r\n\r\nBy this instrument the right to occupy a portion of the Choctaw country\r\nwest of the Mississippi was, with certain privileges, secured to the\r\nChickasaws, who agreed to pay therefor $530,000, of which $30,000\r\nwere paid in 1837, and the remaining $500,000 it was agreed should be\r\ninvested under the direction of the Government of the United States\r\nand that the interest should be paid annually to the Choctaws.\r\n\r\nThere being no money to place in the hands of the United States,\r\nbut a very large amount of Chickasaw stock under the direction of the\r\nTreasury, the reasonable desire of the Choctaws that this large fund\r\nbelonging to them should be put in their own names on the books of the\r\nGovernment can be gratified by a transfer of so much of the stock to the\r\nSecretary of War for their use, upon which the interest will be received\r\nand paid over to them. This will be an execution of the agreement of the\r\nparties. A sale of stocks to raise the money and then a reinvestment of\r\nit according to the letter of the compact ought not to be resorted to on\r\naccount of their present low price in the market.\r\n\r\nIn considering this subject in the course of the autumn the thirteenth\r\narticle of the treaty of 24th May, 1834, with the Chickasaws was\r\nadverted to, by which it is provided: \"If the Chickasaws shall be so\r\nfortunate as to procure a home within the limits of the United States,\r\nit is agreed that, with the consent of the President and Senate, so much\r\nof their invested stock as may be necessary to the purchase of a country\r\nfor them to settle in shall be permitted to them to be sold, or the\r\nUnited States will advance the necessary amount upon a guaranty and\r\npledge of an equal amount of their stocks.\" The compact before referred\r\nto having been ratified by the President and Senate, it was doubted\r\nwhether that was not a virtual consent to the application of so much\r\nof the stock as would be required to pay for the land and privileges\r\ncontracted for by the said compact, and an authority for the transfer\r\nof it. The question was referred to the Attorney-General, who was of\r\nopinion that the transfer could not be legally made without the assent\r\nof the President and Senate to the particular act.\r\n\r\nI have therefore respectfully to request that you will lay the matter\r\nbefore the President, that if he concurs in the propriety of so doing he\r\nmay give his own and ask the consent of the Senate to the proposed\r\nproceeding.\r\n\r\nVery respectfully, your most obedient,\r\n\r\nT.

JOHN FORSYTH, etc.\r\n\r\nSIR: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the\r\n26th instant, in which, in reply to a letter which I had addressed to\r\nyou on the 13th, you acquaint me that the President is not prepared to\r\ncomply with my demand for the liberation of Mr. Alexander McLeod, of\r\nUpper Canada, now imprisoned at Lockport, in the State of New York, on\r\na pretended charge of murder and arson, as having been engaged in the\r\ndestruction of the piratical steamboat _Caroline_ on the 29th of\r\nDecember, 1837.\r\n\r\nI learn with deep regret that such is the decision of the President of\r\nthe United States, for I can not but foresee the very grave and serious\r\nconsequences that must ensue if, besides the injury already inflicted\r\nupon Mr. McLeod of a vexatious and unjust imprisonment, any further harm\r\nshould be done to him in the progress of this extraordinary proceeding.\r\n\r\nI have lost no time in forwarding to Her Majesty's Government in England\r\nthe correspondence that has taken place, and I shall await the further\r\norders of Her Majesty's Government with respect to the important\r\nquestion which that correspondence involves.\r\n\r\nBut I feel it my duty not to close this communication without\r\nlikewise testifying my vast regret and surprise at the expressions which\r\nI find repeated in your letter with reference to the destruction of the\r\nsteamboat _Caroline_. I had confidently hoped that the first erroneous\r\nimpression of the character of that event, imposed upon the mind of the\r\nUnited States Government by partial and exaggerated representations,\r\nwould long since have been effaced by a more strict and accurate\r\nexamination of the facts. Such an investigation must even yet,\r\nI am willing to believe, lead the United States Government to the\r\nsame conviction with which Her Majesty's authorities on the spot\r\nwere impressed--that the act was one, in the strictest sense, of\r\nself-defense, rendered absolutely necessary by the circumstances of the\r\noccasion for the safety and protection of Her Majesty's subjects, and\r\njustified by the same motives and principles which upon similar and\r\nwell-known occasions have governed the conduct of illustrious officers\r\nof the United States. The steamboat _Caroline_ was a hostile vessel\r\nengaged in piratical war against Her Majesty's people, hired from\r\nher owners for that express purpose, and known to be so beyond the\r\npossibility of doubt. The place where the vessel was destroyed was\r\nnominally, it is true, within the territory of a friendly power, but the\r\nfriendly power had been deprived through overbearing piratical violence\r\nof the use of its proper authority over that portion of territory. The\r\nauthorities of New York had not even been able to prevent the artillery\r\nof the State from being carried off publicly at midday to be used as\r\ninstruments of war against Her Majesty's subjects. It was under such\r\ncircumstances, which it is to be hoped will never recur, that the\r\nvessel was attacked by a party of Her Majesty's people, captured, and\r\ndestroyed. A remonstrance against the act in question has been addressed\r\nby the United States to Her Majesty's Government in England. I am not\r\nauthorized to pronounce the decision of Her Majesty's Government upon\r\nthat remonstrance, but I have felt myself bound to record in the\r\nmeantime the above opinion, in order to protest in the most solemn\r\nmanner against the spirited and loyal conduct of a party of Her\r\nMajesty's officers and people being qualified, through an unfortunate\r\nmisapprehension, as I believe, of the facts, with the appellation of\r\noutrage or of murder.\r\n\r\nI avail myself of this occasion to renew to you the assurance of my\r\ndistinguished consideration.\r\n\r\nH.S. FOX.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Forsyth to Mr. Fox_.\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE,\r\n\r\n_Washington, December 31, 1840_.\r\n\r\nSIR: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your note of the\r\n29th instant, in reply to mine of the 26th, on the subject of the arrest\r\nand detention of Alexander McLeod as one of the perpetrators of the\r\noutrage committed in New York when the steamboat _Caroline_ was seized\r\nand burnt. Full evidence of that outrage has been presented to Her\r\nBritannic Majesty's Government with a demand for redress, and of course\r\nno discussion of the circumstances here can be either useful or proper,\r\nnor can I suppose it to be your desire to invite it. I take leave of the\r\nsubject with this single remark, that the opinion so strongly expressed\r\nby you on the facts and principles involved in the demand for reparation\r\non Her Majesty's Government by the United States would hardly have been\r\nhazarded had you been possessed of the carefully collected testimony\r\nwhich has been presented to your Government in support of that demand.\r\n\r\nI avail myself of the occasion to renew to you the assurance of my\r\ndistinguished consideration.\r\n\r\nJOHN FORSYTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 4, 1841_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI submit herewith a treaty concluded with the Miami Indians for the\r\ncession of their lands in the State of Indiana. The circumstances\r\nattending this negotiation are fully set forth in the accompanying\r\ncommunication from the Secretary of War. Although the treaty was\r\nconcluded without positive instructions and the usual official\r\npreliminaries, its terms appear to be so advantageous and the\r\nacquisition of these lands are deemed so desirable by reason of their\r\nimportance to the State of Indiana and the Government, as well as on\r\naccount of the Indians themselves, who will be greatly benefited by\r\ntheir removal west, that I have thought it advisable to submit it to\r\nthe action of the Senate.\r\n\r\nM. VAN BUREN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, _January 4, 1841_.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nSIR: I have the honor to transmit herewith a treaty concluded with the\r\nMiami Indians of the State of Indiana, to be laid before the Senate for\r\ntheir ratification if upon due consideration of the circumstances under\r\nwhich this treaty was negotiated you should think proper to do so. These\r\ncircumstances are fully and correctly set forth in the accompanying\r\ncommunication from the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, to which I beg\r\nleave respectfully to refer you.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, very respectfully, your most obedient servant,\r\n\r\nJ.R. POINSETT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, OFFICE INDIAN AFFAIRS,\r\n\r\n_December 29, 1840_.\r\n\r\nHon. J.R. POINSETT,\r\n\r\n_Secretary of War_.\r\n\r\nSIR: A treaty made with the Miami tribe of Indians in the State of\r\nIndiana on the 28th day of November last for the residue of their lands\r\nin that State has been unexpectedly received.\r\n\r\nGreat anxiety has been manifested by the citizens of Indiana and made\r\nknown by their representatives in both Houses of Congress that a cession\r\nof the Miami land should be procured, and it seems to have been met by\r\na correspondent disposition on the part of the leading men among the\r\nIndians. On the 25th May last a communication was received from General\r\nSamuel Milroy, subagent, etc., expressing the belief that the Miamies\r\nwould treat and that their principal chief was desirous before the close\r\nof his life, now drawing near, to effect a negotiation, as in his\r\nopinion the emigration or extinction of the tribe were the alternatives\r\nbefore them, and suggesting that the most judicious course would be to\r\nconduct the business informally at the annuity payment. In reply he was\r\ninformed on the 2d July that the Department did not open negotiations\r\nfor the purchase of Indian lands unless thereto previously authorized by\r\nCongress, and that at the request of a portion of the representation of\r\nIndiana an estimate had been furnished of the sum that would be required\r\nto hold a treaty, and that if the presumed intention of obtaining the\r\nestimate should be realized an effort would be made to execute the\r\npurpose for which the appropriation would be obtained. (Extracts from\r\nthese letters, so far as they relate to the subject, are herewith sent,\r\nmarked A.[86]) On the 31st July he renewed the subject, accompanied by\r\nan extract of a letter of 22d July to himself from Allen Hamilton, esq.,\r\nthe confidential friend of Chief Richardville, urging the propriety of\r\na negotiation. (B.[86])\r\n\r\nOn the 12th August, no appropriation having been made by Congress, a\r\nletter was addressed to you by the Hon. O.H. Smith, of the Senate of the\r\nUnited States from Indiana, inclosing a letter from Mr. Hamilton, dated\r\non the 11th, urging the vast importance of treating with the Miamies,\r\nas well to them as to the State, and giving the reasons which in the\r\njudgment of both led to the conclusion that their particular case should\r\nform an exception to the general rule that obtains in regard of Indian\r\ntreaties, and recommending strongly the appointment of General Milroy as\r\na suitable person to conduct the negotiation. A communication of similar\r\ncharacter (except the last feature), dated 20th August, was received\r\nfrom Mr. Milroy. The letter of the Hon. Mr. Smith was referred by you to\r\nthis office, and on the 27th August, after a conference with you on the\r\nsubject, I replied that exceptions to the rule stated might under very\r\npeculiar circumstances exist, but that as the Senate certainly, and\r\nit was believed the House too, had rejected an application for an\r\nappropriation, the opening of a negotiation might be considered to be\r\nopposed to an expression of legislative opinion. In answer to the\r\nsuggestion that little or perhaps no expense need be incurred, as the\r\ntreaty could be made at the payment of the annuities, it was remarked\r\nthat the consideration money must necessarily be large, as the Miami\r\nlands were very valuable, and an appropriation of it required, which\r\nCongress might be disinclined to grant after what had happened; that it\r\nwas therefore deemed advisable to decline treating, and that perhaps a\r\nfuture application for legislative sanction might be more successful.\r\nOf this letter a copy was sent to General Milroy as a reply on the\r\nsubject in hand to his communication of 31st July, and his letter of\r\n20th August was further answered on 2d September. (C.[86])\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the representations referred to, and probably others\r\nwhich did not reach me, you addressed me an unofficial note on 14th\r\nSeptember, suggesting that Allen Hamilton, esq., might at the payment\r\nof the annuities make an arrangement with the Miamies that would be\r\n\"gratifying to the people as well as beneficial to the service.\"\r\nWith this expressed wish of the head of the Department, and after\r\nconsultation with you, I wrote unofficial letters to General Samuel\r\nMilroy and to Allen Hamilton, esq., on the 18th September, setting forth\r\nthe views of the Department as hereinbefore expressed in regard of\r\nprecedent legislative sanction and the importance to Indiana of treating\r\nwith the Miamies, whose disposition to cede their remaining lands on\r\njust and equitable terms might not continue. It was thought, however, to\r\nbe in keeping with the rule adopted to ascertain informally from the\r\nMiamies what they would be willing to take for their lands when it was\r\ntheir pleasure to emigrate, etc. It was doubted whether it would be\r\njudicious to reduce the terms to writing, however informally, on account\r\nof the difficulty there might be in convincing the Indians that it was\r\nnot a treaty, although it was desirable, if it could be safely done,\r\nthat it should be so; and they were informed that a report from them\r\nwould answer \"all my purposes, as my object is to be able to say to each\r\nbranch of Congress upon what terms the Miami lands can be had by the\r\nUnited States, so that if the terms are approved the necessary law may\r\nbe passed.\" It was suggested that the annuity payment would afford a\r\ngood opportunity for procuring the information desired, which it was\r\nexpected could be had without any expense, for which there were no\r\nfunds, and that if there were it would not be proper to expend them\r\nin the way proposed. (D.[86])\r\n\r\nI desire to state the facts as they exist so fully as to exhibit\r\nprecisely what has been the action of the Department, without going into\r\nmore detail than may be necessary, and therefore annex extracts and\r\ncopies of the papers referred to instead of embodying them in this\r\ncommunication.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th day of November last a treaty was concluded by Messrs.\r\nSamuel Milroy and Allen Hamilton with \"the chiefs, warriors, and headmen\r\nof the Miami tribe of Indians,\" which was received here on the 19th\r\ninstant, accompanied by a letter explanatory of the treaty and stating\r\nit to have been made by \"the undersigned, acting under instructions\r\ncontained in your unofficial letter dated September 18, 1840;\" that it\r\nwas made at the annuity payment, when \"the views and instructions of the\r\nDepartment\" were \"communicated to the Miami Indians in full council,\"\r\nand that \"after full consideration of the subject they decided to reduce\r\nto treaty form a proposition or the terms upon which they would consent\r\nto cede their remaining lands in Indiana to the United States, subject,\r\nas they understand it, to the approval of the Department and the\r\napproval and ratification of the President and Senate of the United\r\nStates before being of any binding force or efficiency as a treaty.\"\r\nWith the original treaty I send a copy of the explanatory letter and of\r\na communication from General Milroy giving the reasons for the money\r\nprovisions made for the chief Richardville and the family of Chief\r\nGodfrey. (E.[86])\r\n\r\nIt will be thus seen that the negotiation of a treaty was not\r\nauthorized; but if in the opinion of the President and Senate it shall\r\nbe advisable to adopt and confirm it, I do not see any legal objection\r\nto such a course. The quantity of land ceded is estimated at about\r\n500,000 acres, for which the consideration is fixed at $550,000, or\r\n$1.10 per acre, of which $250,000 are payable presently and the balance\r\nin annual payments of $15,000, which will be discharged in twenty years.\r\nIn addition, we will be bound to remove them west of the Mississippi\r\nwithin five years, the period stipulated for their emigration, and to\r\nsubsist them for one year after their arrival. These are the chief\r\nprovisions in which the United States are interested. By the second (it\r\nis called in the treaty now submitted the \"22,\" which, if the President\r\nshould decide to lay it before the Senate, can be corrected by that\r\nbody) article of the treaty of 6th November, 1838, there is reserved\r\nfrom the cession contained in that instrument 10 miles square for the\r\nband of Ma-to-sin-ia, in regard of which the seventh article says:\r\n\r\n  \"It is further stipulated that the United States convey by patent to\r\n  Me-shing-go-me-zia, son of Ma-to-sin-ia, the tract of land reserved by\r\n  the twenty-second article of the treaty of 6th of November, 1838, to\r\n  the band of Ma-to-sin-ia.\"\r\n\r\nThis is a change as to the title of a reservation heretofore sanctioned\r\nand not now ceded, and so far as the United States are concerned does\r\nnot vary the aspect of the present compact. There are reserved to the\r\nchief Richardville seven sections of land, and to him and the family of\r\nthe deceased chief Godfrey are to be paid, respectively, considerable\r\nsums of money, which it seems from the statement of General Milroy were\r\ndebts due to them and acknowledged by the tribe.\r\n\r\nThe treaty of November, 1838, which was ratified on the 8th February,\r\n1839, extinguished the Indian title to about 177,000 acres of land and\r\ncost the United States $335,680, or nearly $2 per acre. Measured by this\r\nprice the present arrangement would seem to be very advantageous. It is\r\nstated by Messrs. Milroy and Hamilton that more favorable terms will not\r\nbe assented to by the Miamies under any circumstances, and considering\r\nthe great importance of the adoption of this compact, however\r\nirregularly made, to the State of Indiana, as well as the belief that\r\nany postponement will probably swallow up what remains to these Indians\r\nin debts which they most improvidently contract and the conviction that\r\nnothing can save them from moral ruin but their removal west, I think\r\nit would be judicious in all views of the matter to adopt and ratify\r\nthis treaty, and respectfully recommend that it, with the accompanying\r\npapers, be laid before the President, and, if he and you concur in my\r\nviews, that the sanction of it by the Senate be asked.\r\n\r\nRespectfully submitted,\r\n\r\nT.

JOHN FORSYTE,\r\n\r\n_Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\nSIR: The commissioners, having assembled in this city in conformity\r\nwith your orders under date of 29th of July, beg leave respectfully\r\nto report--\r\n\r\nThat the extent of country and the great length of the boundary line\r\nincluded in the objects of their commission would have rendered it\r\nimpossible to have completed the task assigned them within the limits of\r\na single season. In addition to this physical impossibility, the work of\r\nthe present year was entered upon under circumstances very unfavorable\r\nfor making any great progress. The law under which they have acted was\r\npassed at the last period of a protracted session, when nearly half\r\nof the season during which working parties can be kept in the field\r\nhad elapsed; and although no delay took place in the appointment of\r\ncommissioners to carry it into effect, the organization of the board was\r\nnot effected, in consequence of the refusal of one of the commissioners\r\nand the agent to accept of their nomination. The commissioners, acting\r\nunder these disadvantages, have done all that lay in their power to\r\naccomplish the greatest practicable extent of work, and have obtained\r\nmany results which can not but be important in the examination of the\r\nvexed and important question which has been committed to them; but after\r\nhaving fully and maturely considered the subject and interchanged the\r\nresults of their respective operations they have come to the conclusion\r\nthat it would be premature to embody the partial results which they have\r\nattained in a general report for the purpose of being laid before the\r\npolitical and scientific world. The meridian line of the St. Croix\r\nhas not been carried to a distance of more than 50 miles from the\r\nmonument at the source of that river, and the operations of the other\r\ncommissioners, although they have covered a wide extent of country,\r\nhave fulfilled but one part of the duty assigned them, namely, that of\r\nexploration; while even in the parts explored actual surveys will be\r\nnecessary for the purpose of presenting the question in such form as can\r\nadmit of no cavil. In particular, the results of the examination of the\r\nmost northern part of the line appear to differ in some points from the\r\nconclusions of the late British commission. Satisfied that the latter\r\nhave been reached in too hasty a manner and without a sufficient time\r\nhaving been expended upon comparative observations, they are cautioned\r\nby this example against committing a like error. In respect to the\r\nargumentative part of the report of the British commissioners, the duty\r\nof furnishing a prompt and immediate reply to such parts of it as rest\r\nupon the construction of treaties and the acts of diplomacy has been\r\nrendered far less important than it might at one time have appeared by\r\nthe publication of the more important parts of the argument laid before\r\nthe King of the Netherlands as umpire. This argument, the deliberate\r\nand studied work of men who well understood the subject, is a full\r\nexposition of the grounds on which the claim of the United States to the\r\nwhole of the disputed territory rests. It has received the sanction of\r\nsuccessive Administrations of opposite politics, and may therefore be\r\nconsidered, in addition to its original official character, as approved\r\nby the whole nation. To this publication your commission beg leave to\r\nrefer as embodying an argument which may be styled unanswerable.\r\n\r\nThe operations of the parties under the command of the several\r\ncommissioners were as follows:\r\n\r\nThe party under the direction of Professor Renwick left Portland in\r\ndetachments on the 26th and 27th of August. The place of general\r\nrendezvous was fixed at Woodstock, or, failing that, at the Grand Falls\r\nof the St. John. The commissary of the party proceeded as speedily as\r\npossible to Oldtown, in order to procure boats and engage men. Professor\r\nRenwick passed by land through Brunswick, Gardiner, and Augusta. At\r\nthe former place barometer No. 1 was compared with that of Professor\r\nCleaveland, at Gardiner with that of Hallowel Gardiner, esq.; and\r\narrangements were made with them to keep registers, to be used as\r\ncorresponding observations with those of the expedition. At Augusta some\r\nadditional articles of equipment were obtained from the authorities of\r\nthe State, but the barometer which it had been hoped might have been\r\nprocured was found to be unfit for service. At Houlton two tents and\r\na number of knapsacks, with some gunpowder, were furnished by the\r\npoliteness of General Bustis from the Government stores.\r\n\r\nThe boats and all the stores reached Woodstock on the 3d September, and\r\nall the party were collected except one engineer, who had been left\r\nbehind at Bangor in the hopes of obtaining another barometer. A bateau\r\nwas therefore left to bring him on. The remainder of the boats were\r\nloaded, and the party embarked on the St. John on the morning of the\r\n4th of September. This, the main body, reached the Grand Falls at noon\r\non the 8th of September. The remaining bateau, with the engineer, arrived\r\nthe next evening, having ascended the rapids of the St. John in a time\r\nshort beyond precedent. On its arrival it was found that the barometer,\r\non whose receipt reliance had been placed, had not been completed in\r\ntime, and although, as was learnt afterwards, it had been committed as\r\nsoon as finished by the maker to the care of Major Graham, the other\r\ncommissioners felt compelled to set out before he had joined them. The\r\nwant of this barometer, in which defects observed in the others had been\r\nremedied, was of no little detriment.\r\n\r\nA delay of eighteen days had occurred in Portland in consequence of the\r\nrefusal of Messrs. Cleavelaud and Jarvis to accept their appointments,\r\nand it was known from the experience of the commissioners sent out in\r\n1838 by the State of Maine that it would require at least three weeks\r\nto reach the line claimed by the United States from Bangor. It was\r\ntherefore imperative to push forward, unless the risk of having the\r\nwhole of the operations of this party paralyzed by the setting in of\r\nwinter was to be encountered. It was also ascertained at the Grand Falls\r\nthat the streams which were to be ascended were always shallow and\r\nrapid, and that at the moment they were extremely low, so that the boats\r\nwould not carry more stores than would be consumed within the time\r\nrequired to reach the region assigned to Professor Renwick as his share\r\nof the duty and return. It became, therefore, necessary, as it had been\r\nbefore feared it must, to be content with an exploration instead of a\r\nclose and accurate survey. Several of the men employed had been at the\r\nnorthern extremity of the meridian line, but their knowledge was limited\r\nto that single object. Inquiry was carefully made for guides through the\r\ncountry between the sources of the Grande Fourche of Restigouche and of\r\nTuladi, but none were to be found. One Indian only had passed from the\r\nhead of Green River to the Grande Fourche, but his knowledge was limited\r\nto a single path, in a direction not likely to shed any light on the\r\nobject of the commission. He was, however, engaged. The French hunters\r\nof Madawaska had never penetrated beyond the sources of Green River, and\r\nthe Indians who formerly resided on the upper waters of the St. John\r\nwere said to have abandoned the country for more than twelve years.\r\n\r\nThe party was now divided into four detachments, the first to proceed\r\ndown the Restigouche to the tide of the Bay of Chaleurs, the second to\r\nascend the Grande Fourche of Restigouche to its source, the third to be\r\nstationed on Green River Mountain, the fourth to convey the surplus\r\nstores and heavy baggage to Lake Temiscouata and thence to ascend the\r\nTuladi and Abagusquash to the highest accessible point of the latter.\r\nIt was resolved that the second and fourth detachments should endeavor\r\nto cross the country and meet each other, following as far as possible\r\nthe height of land. A general rendezvous was again fixed at Lake\r\nTemiscouata.\r\n\r\nIn compliance with this plan, the first and second detachments ascended\r\nthe Grande River together, crossed the Wagansis portage, and reached the\r\nconfluence of the Grande Fourche and southwest branch of Restigouche.\r\n\r\nThe first detachment then descended the united stream, returned by the\r\nsame course to the St. John, and reached the portage at Temiscouata on\r\nthe 7th October. All the intended objects of the detachment were happily\r\naccomplished.\r\n\r\nThe second detachment, under the personal direction of the commissioner,\r\nreached the junction of the north and south branches of the Grande\r\nFourche on the 22d September. Two engineers, with two men to carry\r\nprovisions, were then dispatched to cross the country to the meridian\r\nline, and thence to proceed westward to join the detachment at Kedgwick\r\nLake. This duty was performed and many valuable observations obtained,\r\nbut an accident, by which the barometer was broken, prevented all the\r\nanticipated objects of the mission from being accomplished.\r\n\r\nAll the stores which could possibly be spared were now placed in a depot\r\nat the junction of the south branch, and the commissioner proceeded with\r\nthe boats thus lightened toward Kedgwick Lake. The lightening of the\r\nboats was rendered necessary in consequence of the diminution of the\r\nvolume of the river and the occurrence of falls, over which it would\r\nhave been impossible to convey them when fully loaded. For want of a\r\nguide, a branch more western than that which issues from the lake was\r\nentered. One of the boats was therefore sent round into the lake to\r\nawait the return of the engineers dispatched to the meridian line.\r\nThe stores, which were all that could be brought up in the state of the\r\nwaters, were now found to be wholly insufficient to allow of committing\r\nthe party to the unexplored country between this stream and Tuladi. Even\r\nthe four days which must intervene before the return of the engineers\r\ncould be expected would do much to exhaust them. The commissioner\r\ntherefore resolved to proceed across the country, with no other\r\ncompanion than two men, carrying ten days' provisions. It was hoped that\r\nfour or five days might suffice for the purpose, but ten of great toil\r\nand difficulty were spent before Lake Tuladi was reached. The remainder\r\nof the detachment, united by the return of the engineers, descended the\r\nnorth branch of the Grande Fourche to the junction of the south branch,\r\nascended the latter, and made the portage to Green River. In this the\r\nboats were completely worn out, and the last of their food exhausted\r\njust at the moment that supplies sent up the Green River to meet them\r\narrived at their camp.\r\n\r\nNo arrangement which could have been made would have sufficed to prevent\r\nthe risk of famine which was thus encountered by the second detachment.\r\nA greater number of boats would have required more men, and these would\r\nhave eaten all they could have carried. No other actual suffering but\r\ngreat fatigue and anxiety were encountered; and it is now obvious that\r\nhad the rains which were so abundant during the first week of October\r\nbeen snow (as they sometimes are in that climate) there would have been\r\na risk of the detachment perishing.\r\n\r\nThe third detachment reached their station on Green River Mountain on\r\nthe 13th September and continued there until the 12th October. A full\r\nset of barometric observations was made, the latitude well determined\r\nby numerous altitudes, and the longitude approximately by some lunar\r\nobservations.\r\n\r\nThe fourth detachment, after depositing the stores intended for the\r\nreturn of the party in charge of the British commissary at Fort Ingall,\r\nwho politely undertook the care of them, ascended the Tuladi, and taking\r\nits northern branch reached Lake Abagusquash. Here one of the engineers\r\nwounded himself severely and was rendered unfit for duty. The commissary\r\nthen proceeded a journey of five days toward the east, blazing a path\r\nand making signals to guide the second detachment.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the country as it actually exists and as\r\nrepresented on any maps prevented the commissioner from meeting this\r\nparty. It found the source of the central or main branch of Tuladi to\r\nthe north of that of the Abagusquash, and following the height of land\r\nreached the deep and narrow valley of the Rimouski at the point where,\r\non the British maps, that stream is represented as issuing from a\r\nridge of mountains far north of the line offered to the King of the\r\nNetherlands as the bounds of the American claim. The commissary\r\ntherefore found it impossible to ascend Rimouski to its source, and\r\ncrossing its valley found himself again on a dividing ridge, where he\r\nsoon struck a stream running to the southeast. This, from a comparison\r\nof courses and distances, is believed to be the source of the main\r\nbranch of the Grande Fourche of Ristaymoh; and thus the second and\r\nfourth detachments had reached points within a very short distance\r\nof each other. The greater breadth of the dividing ridge has thus been\r\nexplored, but it will remain to trace the limits of the valley of the\r\nRimouski, which will form a deep indenture in the boundary line. This\r\nline having been explored, a party was formed, after the assemblage\r\nof the several divisions at Temiscouata, for the purpose of leveling\r\nit with the barometer; but the expedition was frustrated by a heavy\r\nsnowstorm, which set in on the 12th October. This, the most important\r\npart of the whole northern line, therefore remains for future\r\ninvestigation. It can only be stated that strong grounds exist for the\r\nbelief that its summits are not only higher than any point which has\r\nbeen measured, but that, although cut by the Rimouski, it exceeds in\r\naverage elevation any part of the disputed territory.\r\n\r\nThe leveling of the Temiscouata portage appeared to be an object of\r\ngreat importance, not only on its own account, but as furnishing a base\r\nfor future operations. As soon as a sufficient force had been assembled\r\nat Lake Temiscouata a party was therefore formed to survey the portage\r\nwith a theodolite. Orders were also given by the commissioner that the\r\nfirst barometer which should be returned should be carried over the\r\nportage. It was believed that this double provision would have secured\r\nthe examination of this point beyond the chance of failure. A snowstorm,\r\nhowever (the same which interrupted the last operation referred to), set\r\nin after the level had been run to the mountain of Biort, and one of the\r\nlaboring men, worn out by his preceding fatigues, fell sick. The party\r\nbeing thus rendered insufficient, the engineer in command found himself\r\ncompelled to return. The contemplated operation with the barometer was\r\nalso frustrated, for on examination at Temiscouata it was found that all\r\nwere unfit for further service. In order that the desired object might\r\nbe accomplished, a new expedition was dispatched from New York on the\r\n12th of November, furnished with four barometers. This party, by great\r\nexertions, reached St. André, on the St. Lawrence, on the eighth day\r\nand accomplished the object of its mission. The operation was rendered\r\npossible at this inclement season by its being confined to a beaten road\r\nand in the vicinity of human habitations.\r\n\r\nThe country which has been the object of this reconnoissance is, as may\r\nalready be understood, of very difficult access from the settled parts\r\nof the State of Maine. It is also, at best, almost impenetrable except\r\nby the water courses. It furnishes no supplies except fish and small\r\ngame, nor can these be obtained by a surveying party which can not be\r\nstrong enough to allow for hunters and fishermen as a constituent part.\r\nThe third detachment alone derived any important benefit from these\r\nsources. The best mode of supplying a party moving on the eastern\r\nsection would be to draw provisions and stores from the St. Lawrence.\r\nIt is, indeed, now obvious, although it is contrary to the belief of any\r\nof the persons professing to be acquainted with the subject, that had\r\nthe commissioner proceeded from New York by the way of Montreal and\r\nQuebec he must have reached the district assigned to him a fortnight\r\nearlier and have accomplished twice as much work as his party was able\r\nto perform.\r\n\r\nAlthough much remains to be done in this region, an extensive knowledge\r\nof a country hitherto unknown and unexplored has been obtained; and this\r\nnot only sheds much light upon the boundary question in its present\r\nstate, but will be of permanent service in case of a further _ex parte_\r\nexamination, or of a joint commission being agreed upon by the\r\nGovernments of Great Britain and the United States.\r\n\r\nThe season was too late for any efficient work, as the line to be\r\nexplored was not reached before the 22d September. Not only were the\r\nrivers at their lowest ebb, but ice was met in the progress of the\r\nparties as early as the 12th September, and snow fell on the 21st and\r\n22d September. The actual setting in of winter, which sometimes occurs\r\nin the first week of October, was therefore to be dreaded. From this\r\ntime the country becomes unfit for traveling of any description until\r\nthe streams are bound with solid ice and a crust formed on the snow of\r\nsufficient firmness to make it passable on snowshoes. The only road is\r\nthat along the St. John River, and it would be almost impossible for a\r\nparty distant more than 10 or 12 miles from that stream to extricate\r\nitself after the winter begins.\r\n\r\nNo duty could be well imagined more likely to be disagreeable than that\r\nassigned to Professor Renwick. The only feasible modes of approach lay\r\nfor hundreds of miles through the acknowledged limits of the British\r\nterritory, and the line he was directed to explore was included within\r\nthe military post of that nation. It may be likened to the entry upon\r\nthe land of a neighbor for the purpose of inquiring into his title.\r\nUnder these circumstances of anticipated difficulty it becomes his duty,\r\nas well as his pleasure, to acknowledge the uniform attention and\r\ncivilities he has experienced from all parties, whether in official\r\nor in private stations. All possibility of interruption by the local\r\nauthorities was prevented by a proclamation of His Excellency Sir John\r\nHarvey, K.C.B., lieutenant-governor of the Province of New Brunswick,\r\nand the British warden, Colonel Maclauchlan, was personally instrumental\r\nin promoting the comforts of the commissioner and his assistants.\r\nSimilar attentions were received from the officers of the garrison at\r\nFort Ingall, and the commandant of the citadel of Quebec, and from His\r\nExcellency the Governor-General. Even the private persons whose property\r\nmight be affected by the acknowledgment of the American claim exhibited\r\na generous hospitality.\r\n\r\nThe party under the direction of Captain Talcott left the settlements on\r\nHalls Stream on the 6th of September. The main branch of this was\r\nfollowed to its source in a swamp, in which a branch of the St. Francis\r\nalso had its origin. From this point the party followed the ridge\r\ndividing the Atlantic from the St. Lawrence waters until it was supposed\r\nthat all the branches of Indian Stream had been headed. In this work the\r\nparty was employed until the 14th September. It had now arrived at a\r\npoint where the Magalloway River should be found to the left, according\r\nto the most authentic map of the country, especially that prepared by\r\nthe New Hampshire commissioner appointed in 1836 to explore the boundary\r\nof that State, and accompanying that report.[90] The party accordingly\r\nbore well north to avoid being led from the true \"height of land\" by the\r\ndividing ridge between the Connecticut and Androscoggin rivers. After\r\ncrossing several small streams, it came on the afternoon of the 15th to\r\na rivulet about 12 feet wide running to the east, which was supposed\r\nto be the main Magalloway. The 16th was spent in exploring it to its\r\nsource. The next day it was discovered that what had been taken for\r\nthe Magalloway was a tributary of Salmon River, a large branch of the\r\nSt. Francis, and consequently the party was considerably to the north of\r\nthe boundary.\r\n\r\nThe supply of provisions did not allow the party to retrace its steps to\r\nthe point where it had diverged from the true dividing ridge. The course\r\nwas therefore changed until it bore a little south; but it was not until\r\nthe 22d that the party found itself again on the dividing ridge, and\r\nthen upon the waters of the Magalloway.\r\n\r\nThe party reached Arnold River, or Chaudiere, above Lake Megantic, on\r\nthe 24th September. After having recruited and taken a fresh supply of\r\nprovisions from the depot established there, the party was divided into\r\ntwo detachments. One returned westward to find the corner of the State\r\nof New Hampshire as marked by the commission in 1789 appointed to trace\r\nthe boundary line.\r\n\r\nIt was there ascertained that the corner was on the true _dividing_\r\nridge, and not from 8 to 10 miles south, as has been erroneously\r\nreported by the surveyor employed by the New Hampshire commissioners in\r\n1836 and reiterated in several official papers. From the State corner\r\nthe dividing ridge was followed to where it had been previously explored\r\nby the party. Thence a course was taken to the northeast so as to reach\r\nthe head of Lake Megantic, and thence to Lake Magaumac, where on the 8th\r\nOctober the two detachments were again united. The detachment led by the\r\nassistant, Mr. Cutts, had successfully followed the dividing ridge from\r\nthe camp of the 24th on Arnold River to this place.\r\n\r\nIt was now ascertained that the provisions remaining were not sufficient\r\nto subsist all of the company until the Kennebec road could be reached\r\nby following the _height of land_. It was thought advisable again to\r\nseparate into two detachments--one to follow the ridge, supplied with\r\nprovisions for twenty days, and the other to strike for the nearest\r\nsettlement, which it was supposed could be reached in four or five\r\ndays. This movement commenced on the 10th October, and the detachment,\r\nfollowing the high land, reached the Kennebec road on the 23d, and on\r\nthe following day provisions for the party for fifteen days were placed\r\nthere and a like quantity at the mouth of the Metjarmette. It was\r\nintended that the two detachments should move simultaneously from these\r\ntwo points on the 26th to explore the boundary line as far as Lake\r\nEtchemin. A deep snow, which commenced falling on the night of the 25th,\r\ncompelled the commissioner to abandon further explorations at that time;\r\nand there was not the slightest probability that they could be resumed\r\nbefore another year.\r\n\r\nThe result of these explorations may be stated as follows:\r\n\r\nAbout 160 miles of country along or near the \"_height of land_\" have\r\nbeen traversed, the traveled distances carefully estimated, and the\r\ncourses measured with a compass. Barometrical observations were made\r\nas often as necessary for giving a profile of the route from the head\r\nof Halls Stream to Arnold or the Chaudiere River, and thence to Lake\r\nMagaumac via the corner of the State of New Hampshire. Some further\r\nbarometrical observations were made between the lake and the Kennebec\r\nroad, but for a portion of that distance the barometer was unserviceable\r\nin consequence of air having entered the tube. Astronomical observations\r\nwere made as often as there was an opportunity, but, owing to the\r\nprevalence of clouds, not as often as was desirable. They will serve for\r\ncorrecting the courses and estimated distances traveled. Barometrical\r\nobservations for comparison were made at the intersection of the\r\nKennebec road and height of land hourly from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. while the\r\nparties were on the dividing ridge.\r\n\r\nThe only discovery of interest made by this party is that the Magalloway\r\nRiver does not head any of the branches of the Connecticut, as it was\r\ngenerally believed it did, and consequently our claim to Halls Stream is\r\ndeprived of the support it would have had from the fact that _all_ the\r\nother branches were headed by an Atlantic river, and consequently could\r\nnot be reached by the line along the height of land from the northwest\r\nangle of Nova Scotia.\r\n\r\nThe other commissioner (Major Graham) did not receive his appointment\r\nuntil 16th August to fill the place left vacant by the nonacceptance of\r\nProfessor Cleaveland, and to him was assigned the survey and examination\r\nof the due north line, commencing at the source of the river St. Croix\r\nand extending to the highlands which divide the waters that flow into\r\nthe river St. Lawrence from those which flow into the Atlantic Ocean.\r\n\r\nImmediately after receiving his appointment he took the necessary\r\nsteps for organizing his party, and in addition to two officers of the\r\nCorps of Topographical Engineers, assigned to him by the commandant of\r\nthe Corps for this service, he called to his aid two civil engineers\r\npossessing the requisite qualifications for the duties to be performed.\r\nSo soon as the requisite instruments could be procured and put in proper\r\norder he left New York for Portland, Me., where he arrived on the\r\n5th of September, expecting there to join his colleagues of the\r\ncommission. They had, however, proceeded to the points designated for\r\nthe commencement of their respective duties, the season being too far\r\nadvanced to justify their incurring any further delay.\r\n\r\nAt Portland a short conference was had with Mr. Stubbs, the agent of the\r\nState Department, who furnished the necessary means for procuring an\r\noutfit for the party in provisions, camp equipage, etc.\r\n\r\nThe party then proceeded to Bangor, where it was occupied until the\r\n12th in procuring the necessary supplies of provisions, camp equipage,\r\ntransportation, etc., to enable it to take the field; and a few\r\nastronomical observations were made here for the purpose of testing the\r\nrates of the chronometers which were to be used upon this service, as\r\nwell as of obtaining additional data for computing the longitude of this\r\nplace, which, together with the latitude, had been determined by the\r\ncommissioner by a very near approximation in the summer of 1838, while\r\noccupied upon the military reconnoissances of the northeastern frontier.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th the party left Bangor for Houlton, where it arrived on the\r\nevening of the 13th. A depot of provisions was established here for\r\nsupplying the line of their future operations, and the services of the\r\nrequisite number of men as axmen, chain bearers, instrument carriers,\r\netc., were engaged.\r\n\r\nPending these preparations and the time necessarily occupied in cutting\r\na roadway through the forest from a convenient point on the Calais road\r\nto the monument at the source of the river St. Croix, a series of\r\nastronomical observations was made, both by day and by night, by which\r\nthe latitude and longitude of Houlton were satisfactorily determined and\r\nthe rates of the chronometers further tested.\r\n\r\nBy the 24th of September the roadway was sufficiently opened to permit\r\na camp to be established upon the experimental line traced by the United\r\nStates and British surveyors in the year 1817, when an attempt was made\r\nto mark this portion of the boundary between the two countries agreeably\r\nto the provisions of the treaty of Ghent of 1815.\r\n\r\nThe provisions and camp equipage were transported upon a strong but\r\nroughly constructed sled, drawn by horses, whilst the instruments were\r\ncarried by hand, the surface of the country over which this roadway was\r\nopened being too rough for any wheeled vehicle to pass.\r\n\r\nThe point decided upon as the true source of the river St. Croix by the\r\nUnited States and British commissioners appointed for that purpose under\r\nthe fifth article of the treaty of 1794 was found and identified, both\r\nby the inscriptions upon the monument erected there to mark the spot and\r\nalso by the testimony of a living witness of high respectability, who\r\nhas known the locality since it was first designated by the\r\ncommissioners under the treaty of 1794.\r\n\r\nThe avenue which had been cleared through a dense forest from the\r\nmonument to a distance of 12 miles north of it by the surveyors in\r\n1817 was easily recognized by the new and thick growth of young timber,\r\nwhich, having a width of from 40 to 50 feet, now occupied it. Axmen were\r\nat once set at work to reopen this avenue, under the supposition that\r\nthe due north line would at least fall within its borders for a distance\r\nof 12 miles. In the meantime the first astronomical station and camp\r\nwere established, and the transit instrument set up at a distance of\r\n4,578 feet north of the monument, upon an eminence 45-1/2 feet above\r\nthe level of its base. This position commanded a distinct view of\r\nthe monument to the south, and of the whole line to the north for\r\na distance of 11 miles, reaching to Parks Hill. Whilst the work of\r\nclearing the line of its young growth of timber was progressing a\r\nseries of astronomical observations was commenced at this first camp,\r\nand continued both day and night without intermission (except when\r\ninterrupted by unfavorable weather), with the sextant, the repeating\r\ncircle of reflection, and the transit instrument, until the latitude and\r\nlongitude of the monument and of this first camp were satisfactorily\r\nascertained, and also the direction of the true meridian from the said\r\nmonument established. For this latter purpose several observations\r\nwere in the first place made upon the polar star ([Greek: alpha] Ursae\r\nMinoris) when at its greatest eastern diurnal elongation, and the\r\ndirection thus obtained was afterwards verified and corrected by\r\nnumerous transit observations upon stars passing the meridian at various\r\naltitudes both north and south of the zenith. These were multiplied with\r\nevery degree of care, and with the aid of four excellent chronometers,\r\nwhose rates were constantly tested, not only by the transit\r\nobservations, but also by equal altitudes of the sun in the day, to\r\ncorrect the time at noon and midnight, and by observed altitudes of east\r\nand west stars for correcting the same at various hours of the night.\r\n\r\nThe direction of this meridian, as thus established by the commissioner,\r\nwas found to vary from the experimental line traced by the surveyors of\r\n1817 by running in the first place to the west of their line, then\r\ncrossing it, and afterwards deviating considerably to the east of it.\r\n\r\nAt the second principal station erected by the party, distant 6 miles\r\nand 3,952 feet north of the first camp, or 7 miles and 3,240 feet north\r\nof the monument, it found itself 60 feet to the west of the line of\r\n1817. This appeared to be the maximum deviation to the west of that\r\nline as near as its trace could be identified, which was only marked by\r\npermanent objects recognized by the party at the termination of each\r\nmile from the monument. Soon after passing this station the line of 1817\r\nwas crossed, and the party did not afterwards touch it, but deviated\r\nmore and more to the east of it as it progressed north by an irregular\r\nproportion to the distance advanced.\r\n\r\nIn order to obtain a correct profile or vertical section along the\r\nwhole extent of this meridian line, in the hopes of furnishing data for\r\naccurate comparisons of elevations so far as they might be considered\r\nrelevant to the subject in dispute between the two Governments, and also\r\nto afford an accurate base of comparison for the barometers along an\r\nextended line which must traverse many ridges that will be objects of\r\nminute exploration for many miles of lateral extent, an officer was\r\ndetailed to trace a line of levels from the base of the monument marking\r\nthe source of the river St. Croix to tide water at Calais, in Maine, by\r\nwhich means the elevation of the base of the monument above the planes\r\nof mean low and mean high water, and also the elevations of several\r\nintermediate points of the river St. Croix on its expanded lake surface,\r\nhave been accurately ascertained.\r\n\r\nAnother officer was at the same time charged with tracing a line of\r\nlevels from the base of the same monument along the due north line\r\nas marked by the commissioner, by which it is intended that every\r\nundulation with the absolute heights above the plane of mean low water\r\nat Calais shall be shown along the whole extent of that line.\r\n\r\nAt Parks Hill, distant only 12 miles from the monument, a second station\r\nfor astronomical observations was established, and a camp suitable for\r\nthat purpose was formed. On the 26th day of October, whilst occupied in\r\ncompleting the prolongation of the meridian line to that point and in\r\nestablishing a camp there, the party was visited by a snowstorm, which\r\ncovered the ground to a depth of 4 inches in the course of six hours.\r\nThis was succeeded by six days of dark, stormy weather, which entirely\r\ninterrupted all progress, and terminated by a rain, with a change to a\r\nmilder temperature, which cleared away the snow. During this untoward\r\nevent the parties made themselves as comfortable as practicable in their\r\ntents, and were occupied in computing many of the astronomical and other\r\nobservations previously made.\r\n\r\nOn the 2d of November the weather became clear, and the necessary\r\nastronomical observations were immediately commenced at Parks Hill.\r\nFrom this elevated point the first station could be distinctly seen by\r\nmeans of small heliotropes during the day and bright lights erected upon\r\nit at night. Its direction, with that of several intermediate stations\r\ndue south of Parks Hill, was verified by a new series of transit\r\nobservations upon high and low stars, both north and south of the\r\nzenith. By the same means the line was prolonged to the north.\r\n\r\nIn one week after commencing the observations at Parks Hill the weather\r\nbecame again unfavorable. The sky was so constantly overcast as to\r\npreclude all astronomical observations, and the atmosphere so thick as\r\nto prevent a view to the north which would permit new stations to be\r\nestablished with sufficient accuracy in that direction. Unwilling to\r\nquit the field while there was a prospect of the weather becoming\r\nsufficiently favorable to enable the party to reach the latitude of Mars\r\nHill, or even proceed beyond it, it was determined that some of the\r\nparty should continue in the tents, and there occupy themselves with\r\nsuch calculations as ought to be made before quitting the field. The\r\nofficers charged with the line of levels and with the reconnoissances in\r\nadvance for the selection of new positions for stations continued their\r\nlabors in the field, notwithstanding they were frequently exposed to\r\nslight rain and snow storms, as these portions of the work could go on\r\nwithout a clear sky.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th of November a severe snowstorm occurred, which in a single\r\nnight and a portion of the following morning covered the surface of\r\nthe whole country and the roofs of the tents to a depth of 16 inches.\r\nThe northern extremity of the avenue which had been cleared by the\r\nsurveyors of 1817 was now reached, and, in addition to the young growth\r\nwhich had sprung up since that period upon the previous part of the\r\nline, several miles had been cleared through the dense forest of heavy\r\ntimber in order to proceed with the line of levels, which had reached\r\nnearly to the Meduxnakeag. The depth of snow now upon the ground\r\nrendered it impracticable to continue the leveling with the requisite\r\naccuracy any further, and that part of the work was accordingly\r\nsuspended for the season. The thermometer had long since assumed a range\r\nextending during the night and frequently during a great portion of the\r\nday to many degrees below the freezing point.\r\n\r\nThe highlands bordering on the Aroostook, distant 40 miles to the north\r\nof the party, were distinctly seen from an elevated position whenever\r\nthe atmosphere was clear, and a long extent of intermediate country of\r\ninferior elevation to the position then occupied presented itself to the\r\nview, with the two peaks of Mars Hill rising abruptly above the general\r\nsurface which surrounded their base. The eastern extremity of the base\r\nof the easternmost peak was nearly 2 degrees of arc, or nine-tenths of a\r\nmile in space, to the west of the line as it passed the same latitude.\r\n\r\nTo erect stations opposite to the base of Mars Hill and upon the heights\r\nof the Aroostook, in order to obtain exact comparisons with the old line\r\nat these points, were considered objects of so much importance as to\r\ndetermine the commissioner to continue the operations in the field to\r\nthe latest practicable period in hopes of accomplishing these ends.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th day of November the party succeeded in erecting a station\r\nopposite Mars Hill and very near the meridian line. It was thus proved\r\nthat the line would pass from nine-tenths of a mile to 1 mile east of\r\nthe eastern extremity of the base of the northeast peak of Mars Hill.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th of November a series of signals was commenced to be\r\ninterchanged at night between the position of the transit instrument\r\non Parks Hill and the highlands of the Aroostook. These were continued\r\nat intervals whenever the weather was sufficiently clear until by\r\nsuccessive approximations a station was on the 9th of December\r\nestablished on the heights 1 mile south of that river and on the\r\nmeridian line. The point thus reached is more than 50 miles from\r\nthe monument at the source of the St. Croix, as ascertained from\r\nthe land surveys made under the authority of the States of Maine and\r\nMassachusetts. The measurements of the party could not be extended\r\nto this last point, owing to the depth of the snow which lay upon the\r\nground since the middle of November, but the distance derived from the\r\nland surveys must be a very near approximation to the truth. A permanent\r\nstation was erected at the position established on the Aroostook heights\r\nand a measurement made from it due west to the experimental or exploring\r\nline of 1817, by which the party found itself 2,400 feet to the east of\r\nthat line.\r\n\r\nBetween the 1st and 15th of December the observations were carried on\r\nalmost exclusively during the night, and frequently with the thermometer\r\nranging from 0 to 10 and 12 degrees below that point by Fahrenheit's\r\nscale. Although frequently exposed to this temperature in the\r\nperformance of their duties in the open air at night, and to within a\r\nfew degrees of that temperature during the hours of sleep, with no other\r\nprotection than the tents and camp beds commonly used in the Army, the\r\nwhole party, both officers and men, enjoyed excellent health.\r\n\r\nDuring the day the tents in which the astronomical computations were\r\ncarried on were rendered quite comfortable by means of small stoves,\r\nbut at night the fire would become extinguished and the temperature\r\nreduced to within a few degrees of that of the outward air. Within\r\nthe observatory tent the comfort of a fire could not be indulged in,\r\nin consequence of the too great liability to produce serious errors\r\nof observation by the smoke passing the field of the telescope. The\r\nastronomical observations were therefore always made in the open air or\r\nin a tent open to the heavens at top during the hours of observation,\r\nand without a fire.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th of December the tents were struck and this party retired\r\nfrom the field for the season, there being then more than 2 feet of snow\r\non the ground. To the unremitting zeal amidst severe exposures, and to\r\nthe scientific and practical attainments of the officers, both civil and\r\nmilitary, who served under the orders of the commissioner on this duty,\r\nhe acknowledges himself in a great measure indebted for the progress\r\nthat he was enabled to make, notwithstanding the many difficulties\r\nencountered.\r\n\r\nObservations were made during portions of three lunations of the transit\r\nof the moon's bright limb and of such tabulated stars as differed but\r\nlittle in right ascension and declination from the moon, in order to\r\nobtain additional data to those furnished by chronometrical comparisons\r\nwith the meridian of Boston for computing the longitude of this meridian\r\nline.\r\n\r\nAt the first station, 4,578 feet north of the monument, and also at the\r\nParks Hill station, the dip of the magnetic needle was ascertained by a\r\nseries of observations--in the one case upon two and in the other upon\r\nthree separate needles. The horizontal declination was also ascertained\r\nat both these stations by a full set of observations upon six different\r\nneedles.\r\n\r\nThe details of these and of all the astronomical observations alluded to\r\nwill be prepared as soon as practicable for the use of the commission,\r\nshould they be required. To His Excellency Major-General Sir John\r\nHarvey, K.C.B., lieutenant-governor of the Province of New Brunswick,\r\nMajor Graham acknowledges himself greatly indebted for having in the\r\nmost obliging manner extended to him-every facility within his power for\r\nprosecuting the examinations. From Mr. Connell, of Woodstock, a member\r\nof the colonial parliament, and from Lieutenant-Colonel Maclauchlan,\r\nthe British land agent, very kind attentions were received.\r\n\r\nMajor Graham has also great pleasure in acknowledging his obligations to\r\nGeneral Eustis, commandant of the Eastern Department; to Colonel Pierce,\r\ncommanding the garrison at Houlton, and to his officers; and also to\r\nMajor Ripley, of the Ordnance Department, commanding the arsenal at\r\nAugusta, for the prompt and obliging manner in which they supplied many\r\narticles useful to the prosecution of the labors of his party.\r\n\r\nThe transit instrument with which the meridian line was traced had been\r\nloaned to the commission by the Hon. William A. Duer, president of\r\nColumbia College, New York, and the commissioners feel bound to return\r\ntheir acknowledgments for the liberality with which the use of this\r\nastronomical instrument was granted at a time when it would have been\r\ndifficult, and perhaps impossible, to have procured one as well suited\r\nto the object.\r\n\r\nAll which is respectfully submitted.\r\n\r\nJAS.
