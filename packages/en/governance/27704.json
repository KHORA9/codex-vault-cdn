So long as there was the faintest hope of\r\nHis Majesty's recovery, Mr. Pitt was enabled to avert extremities\r\nbetween the Administration and the Prince of Wales, by repeated\r\nadjournments of Parliament. The interest, therefore, which attached to\r\nthe slightest items of intelligence contained in these letters may be\r\neasily understood. All other subjects were of inferior consideration.\r\nEven the serious inconvenience occasioned to the public service by the\r\nsuspension of business in Parliament was forgotten in the one absorbing\r\ntopic.\r\n\r\nThe uncertainty that hung over the issue, the responsibility that\r\nattended the treatment of the case, and the extreme caution observed by\r\nthe physicians in the opinions they were called upon to pronounce, kept\r\nall classes of the people in a state of constant agitation. The Prince\r\nand his supporters availed themselves of these circumstances to\r\nstrengthen their party in Parliament and out of doors. The passions of\r\nthe inexperienced, and the hopes of the discontented, are always on the\r\nside of youth and excitement; and every vicissitude in the condition of\r\nthe King that diminished the prospect of his recovery, augmented the\r\nranks of the Opposition, which now became familiarly known as \"the\r\nPrince of Wales's Opposition.\" Mr. Pitt acted throughout with the utmost\r\nreserve. Deeply impressed by the complicated hazards of the situation,\r\nhe carefully avoided all allusions to his ulterior intentions in his\r\nintercourse with the Prince of Wales, which was strictly formal and\r\nofficial, and confined to such communications as were unavoidable in his\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Whitehall, Nov. 15th, 1788.\r\n     MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     I enclose you the note, which I received from Pitt last night on\r\n     his return from Windsor. I have seen him this morning; and\r\n     understand that Warren said one thing which is still more\r\n     favourable. He told him that a more rapid amendment would, in his\r\n     opinion, have been a less pleasing symptom; and I find, from Pitt,\r\n     that on conversing both with Sir G. Baker and Reynolds, he found\r\n     them rather more sanguine, upon the whole, than Warren, but\r\n     agreeing with him in his general account. What I have learnt this\r\n     morning seems to confirm the pleasing hope which I cannot help\r\n     indulging, from all these circumstances, though, God knows, it is\r\n     still exposed to much doubt and hazard. The public account, which\r\n     has been uniformly less flattering than the private letters from\r\n     Windsor, states that he has had six hours' sleep, and that he is a\r\n     little better this morning. All the other accounts say that he is\r\n     certainly getting better.\r\n\r\n     Pitt saw the Prince of Wales yesterday, for the purpose of\r\n     notifying to him the step which the Council had taken, of ordering\r\n     prayers, and of acquainting him that he had written circular\r\n     letters to _all_ the Members of the House of Commons, stating the\r\n     probability of Parliament having to meet on Thursday; and that he\r\n     meant then to propose to adjourn.\r\n\r\n     Prince of Wales received the communication with civility, and told\r\n     him he was persuaded no opposition could be made to this. It is, I\r\n     think, plain, from Pitt's account of his general behaviour, and\r\n     from what one hears, that my conjecture is right, and that he will\r\n     dismiss Pitt without hesitation.\r\n\r\n     Ever most affectionately yours,\r\n     W. W. G.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Whitehall, Nov. 17th, 1788.\r\n     MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     The accounts for the last two days have been, I think, rather less\r\n     favourable than that of Saturday, which I sent you. You can,\r\n     however, hardly conceive the difficulty which we have, even at this\r\n     small distance, to procure such information as can be in any degree\r\n     depended on. All the private accounts are so strongly tinctured by\r\n     the wishes of those who send them, that no reliance can be placed\r\n     upon them; and the private letters of the physicians are frequently\r\n     inconsistent with each other, and even with the public account\r\n     which they send to St. James's. In general, that account has been\r\n     uniformly found to be the least favourable; and seems as if it was\r\n     drawn for the purpose of discouraging the hopes which their own\r\n     letters and conversation excite. The letters which they read to\r\n     Pitt, though frequently varying in their general tenor from the\r\n     public account, are not at all more detailed than that is, and take\r\n     no sort of notice of the most material circumstances. I imagine all\r\n     this is to be imputed to a difference of opinion which is supposed\r\n     to prevail amongst them, it being believed that Warren is strongly\r\n     inclined to think the disorder permanent, and that Reynolds is\r\n     sanguine in the contrary opinion. Pitt is gone down again to\r\n     Windsor to-day; but will hardly be back again time enough for me to\r\n     insert his account in this letter. The public account of to-day\r\n     says, I understand, that the King has had much quiet and composed\r\n     sleep, but is nearly the same as before. The sleep, I am told, is\r\n     generally considered as a favourable symptom.\r\n\r\n     Under these circumstances, there can, I think, be no doubt that the\r\n     two Houses will adjourn on Thursday, without opposition.\r\n\r\n     Everything remains as before. I think you clearly have done right\r\n     in stopping Corry, it being so much our interest to prevent, and\r\n     not to promote, negotiation. I think, on more reflexion, that the\r\n     idea of refusing the power of dissolving is impracticable, and may\r\n     be turned against us in the end; the other limitations will, I\r\n     believe, be proposed; and that alone will be sufficient to put all\r\n     negotiation out of the question.\r\n\r\n     Fox is expected in three or four days; but it seems impossible that\r\n     he should be here so soon.\r\n\r\n     Ever most affectionately yours,\r\n     W. W. G.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Whitehall, Nov. 18th, 1788.\r\n     MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     I do not find from Pitt that he learnt anything very particular\r\n     yesterday in addition to what you already know. The King continues\r\n     much quieter, but still deranged in his intellects and\r\n     conversation. The fever has not yet entirely left him. The\r\n     physicians seem very unwilling to say anything with respect to his\r\n     situation, and declare that it must still be eight or ten days\r\n     before they can pronounce at all decisively as to the nature of his\r\n     disorder.\r\n\r\n     You seem, in your letter, to conceive the point of his recovery to\r\n     be much more desperate than I understand it to be thought even\r\n     after a derangement of months, or even years. There hardly passes a\r\n     day in which one does not hear of cases of that sort, and we are\r\n     now told that a disorder of this sort has appeared in several\r\n     instances in Devonshire in the course of this autumn, where the\r\n     patient has been in this way for six weeks together, and has then\r\n     entirely recovered.\r\n\r\n     I have no other news.\r\n\r\n     Ever most affectionately yours,\r\n     W. W. G.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Whitehall, Nov. 20th, 1788.\r\n     MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     I went down yesterday to Windsor, as a matter of form, to inquire\r\n     after the King's health. Having nothing very material to write to\r\n     you in the morning, I thought it best to take the chance of being\r\n     back early enough to write before the post went out. This, however,\r\n     I found impossible, on account of the different people whom I met at\r\n     Windsor, and with whom I was naturally anxious to converse.\r\n\r\n     The account, as far as relates to the King's actual situation for\r\n     these two or three last days, is much less favourable than it has\r\n     been. The disorder of his intellects has continued almost, if not\r\n     entirely, without intermission for the whole of that time. He talks\r\n     incessantly for many hours together, and without any appearance of\r\n     sense or reason, sometimes knowing the persons who are about him, at\r\n     other times mistaking them, or fancying himself employed in\r\n     different occupations, such as taking notes on books, or giving\r\n     different orders. He has appeared several times to have that sort of\r\n     consciousness of his situation which lunatics are observed to\r\n     possess, and to use the same sort of methods for concealing it. All\r\n     this constitutes the gloomy side of the picture; and Warren is so\r\n     much impressed with this, that he told Pitt there was now every\r\n     reason to believe that the disorder was no other than direct lunacy.\r\n\r\n     On the other hand, I understand that he, as well as the other\r\n     physicians, are now agreed as to the cause of the disorder. You may\r\n     remember that, at the beginning of this unhappy situation, I\r\n     mentioned to you that an idea had been entertained of its proceeding\r\n     from some local cause, such as water on the brain, or some change in\r\n     the texture of the brain itself, by induration or ossification.\r\n     Warren has decidedly said, that he is satisfied this is entirely out\r\n     of the question; this he told Pitt in express terms. The cause to\r\n     which they all agree to ascribe it, is the force of a humour which\r\n     was beginning to show itself in the legs, when the King's imprudence\r\n     drove it from thence into the bowels; and the medicines which they\r\n     were then obliged to use for the preservation of his life, have\r\n     repelled it upon the brain. The consequence of this opinion is so\r\n     plain, that there certainly requires no professional skill to know\r\n     that his recovery must depend upon this single circumstance, whether\r\n     there is, or is not strength enough in his constitution to throw off\r\n     this humour by any other channel. The physicians are now\r\n     endeavouring, by warm baths, and by great warmth of covering, to\r\n     bring it down again into the legs, which nature had originally\r\n     pointed out as the best mode of discharge.\r\n\r\n     I was mentioning these circumstances yesterday to a person who lives\r\n     in intimacy with John Hunter, the anatomist. He told me that they\r\n     had been all stated to him three days ago, by Hunter, who had\r\n     collected them from the different inquiries he had made. Hunter\r\n     added, that we must still expect for some days, and perhaps even\r\n     weeks, to hear of no decisive alteration, but possibly of some\r\n     occasional variation from day to day; that at the end of this it\r\n     would probably come to some sort of crisis, by which it would appear\r\n     whether there was strength enough in the constitution to prevail\r\n     over the disease; that all he had heard of the manner of the King's\r\n     life, did unquestionably make him an unfavourable subject for such a\r\n     struggle, but that if it was the case of any common man, he should\r\n     have no hesitation in pronouncing even now that it would be very bad\r\n     luck indeed if he did not recover, and that the chances were nine to\r\n     one in his favour. You will easily suppose that this was said under\r\n     the seal of confidence, and that a professional man would not choose\r\n     to have his name quoted in a case of so much importance in which he\r\n     is not employed, and in which his opinions may be either founded at\r\n     present on false information, or may be defeated by the mode of\r\n     treatment adopted by those who are called in. I have, therefore,\r\n     mentioned this only to you, though possibly you may hear it from\r\n     other channels. On such authority, one certainly may be allowed to\r\n     indulge some degree of hope. I am, however, far from letting this\r\n     expectation take possession of my mind, but, on the contrary, have\r\n     prepared myself for the worst, and can with truth say that I have\r\n     made up my mind to meet it with cheerfulness, and to accommodate\r\n     myself as a reasonable man ought to do to my situation.\r\n\r\n     You will particularly see that this consideration had no effect on\r\n     my judgment, and that I feel as you do. On the question of a\r\n     coalition, no offers have as yet been made. The language of\r\n     Opposition inclines one to think that their idea is _to that_, but\r\n     the conduct of the Prince of Wales marks a desire of avoiding Pitt.\r\n     I believe he has had no communication with the Duke of Portland, or\r\n     with any of them, except Sheridan and Lord Loughborough; the latter\r\n     is supposed to be much in his confidence. Pitt has opened his plan\r\n     of Regency to Thurlow and Lord Weymouth, and they both approved it;\r\n     he is to lay it before the Prince of Wales in a few days, and will\r\n     then make it public.\r\n\r\n     Whatever is done, I have no conception that it can be brought to a\r\n     point so as to enable you to form any decisive judgment with respect\r\n     to your situation so early as the beginning of next month. We are\r\n     now at the 19th. Pitt means to-day to move an adjournment to this\r\n     day sevennight, and a call of the House for this day fortnight. It\r\n     is doubtful whether the business will even then be brought on, and\r\n     the intervening adjournment is made with the view of enabling Pitt\r\n     to put off the call to a more distant day if the King's situation\r\n     should be thought to render that a proper step.\r\n\r\n     Bernard is now out of town, but I understood from him that your\r\n     house in Pall Mall was let to the Duke of Gordon for another year,\r\n     to commence from Christmas.\r\n\r\n     I am just returned from the House, where Pitt moved the adjournment\r\n     for the whole fortnight (in consequence of an opinion of the\r\n     Chancellor's), and a call at the end of that term. Not a word was\r\n     said by any other person, and he himself barely stated that the\r\n     continuance of the King's illness had prevented the prorogation, and\r\n     that the same circumstance made it desirable to have the public\r\n     attendance when the House met again.\r\n\r\n     The public account of to-day is that he has passed a less disturbed\r\n     night, but that the fever continues.\r\n\r\n     Ever most affectionately yours,\r\n     W. W. G.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Whitehall, Nov. 20th, 1788.\r\n     MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     The accounts which Pitt received last night are more favourable\r\n     than any which have yet been sent. They stated particularly, that\r\n     during the whole course of yesterday the King was more composed,\r\n     and with less incoherency in his conversation, than he has been at\r\n     any period during the last fortnight. The opinion which I mentioned\r\n     to you yesterday prevents my being very sanguine with respect to\r\n     the _uniform_ continuance of these symptoms; but it is certainly no\r\n     light confirmation of that opinion to observe this sort of\r\n     fluctuation; and it is a pleasant circumstance to find that this\r\n     abatement of his disorder has followed so immediately on the\r\n     application of fomentations to the legs.\r\n\r\n     Since I wrote the above, the accounts of this morning have been\r\n     received. I enclose the public note, which admits that there is\r\n     some remission of the fever, by which word they describe the\r\n     delirium. The letter sent to Pitt only states that the King is less\r\n     well than he was during most part of yesterday. I do not learn that\r\n     there is yet any appearance of swelling or eruption on the legs. On\r\n     the whole, though the account of this morning is certainly less\r\n     encouraging, I think the two taken together by no means diminish\r\n     the hopes which I trust there is reason to entertain.\r\n\r\n     It is become very difficult to get at the real truth; for since\r\n     there has been an appearance of amendment, Opposition have been\r\n     taking inconceivable pains to spread the idea that his disorder is\r\n     incurable. Nothing can exceed Warren's indiscretion on this\r\n     subject.\r\n\r\n     You will probably have heard from other quarters how favourable the\r\n     appearance of yesterday, and the reception of Pitt's speech, were.\r\n     There seems to be just such a spirit and zeal gone forth among his\r\n     friends as one would most desire; and whatever is now the event of\r\n     this anxious moment, I am persuaded you will see him increase from\r\n     it in point of character, and lose little in point of strength.\r\n     What passed yesterday, and the tone of our friends, are much beyond\r\n     the expectations which I had formed.\r\n\r\n     Ever most affectionately yours,\r\n     W. W. G.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Whitehall, Nov. 22nd, 1788.\r\n     MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     I went this morning to Nepean, to speak about sending you the\r\n     official accounts of the King's health. He assured me that he had\r\n     regularly done so for the last week, and that he would continue it.\r\n     He sends a messenger to-morrow, so that this letter will be very\r\n     short.\r\n\r\n     You will receive the St. James's account of this day from Nepean. I\r\n     have not yet seen it, but am assured that all the private accounts\r\n     are favourable. So are, as far as I can learn, the declared\r\n     opinions of every medical man except those who are employed: and of\r\n     those, Warren only speaks unfavourably. The rest say nothing.\r\n\r\n     The indecency of any language held on your side of the water cannot\r\n     exceed that of the universal tone of Opposition within these last\r\n     four or five days. So long as they considered the case as\r\n     desperate, they were affecting a prodigious concern and reverence\r\n     for the King's unhappy situation. Now that people entertain hopes\r\n     of his recovery, they are using the utmost industry to combat this\r\n     idea--circulating all the particulars of everything which he does\r\n     or says under his present circumstances, and adding the most\r\n     outrageous falsehoods.\r\n\r\n     I think I can say with confidence, that no enmity against an\r\n     individual, much less against a person in such a rank as his, could\r\n     induce me to retail the different acts of frenzy which he may\r\n     commit in a state of delirium or insanity.\r\n\r\n     Ever most affectionately yours,\r\n     W. W. G.\r\n\r\n     Don't use your new cypher, for I doubt whether mine is not rendered\r\n     useless. I will write to you about it to-morrow.\r\n\r\n     P.S.--The cypher will be better set by the _last_ letter of the\r\n     word _en clair_, immediately preceding the cyphered part of the\r\n     letter. I will use it in that manner when I write.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Whitehall, Nov. 23rd, 1788.\r\n     MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     _I_[A] write this by Lord Sydney's messenger, but with such an\r\n     aching head that it is impossible for me to enter into much detail.\r\n     Pitt was at Windsor yesterday, and by his account, which he\r\n     collected from the persons who immediately attend the King's\r\n     person, there can be no doubt of the King's being much better, and\r\n     more composed than he has been since his illness began. At the same\r\n     time, the accounts of the physicians are gloomy, and with less hope\r\n     than they have before expressed. It is very difficult to reconcile\r\n     these contradictions. Rennel Hawkins, the surgeon who has attended\r\n     him during the whole illness, and sits up with him every other\r\n     night, has written a letter to Sir Clifton Wintringham, which the\r\n     latter has shown about London, in which the King's recovery is\r\n     mentioned as a thing certain, and likely to take place, sooner than\r\n     people in general expect. On these data you can judge as well as\r\n     we can here. I confess myself to be sanguine in my hopes of his\r\n     recovery. In the meantime, no pains are spared to circulate all\r\n     sorts of lies, in order to depress people's spirits on this\r\n     subject; and the support which is given to these gloomy ideas by\r\n     the language and conduct of the physicians does certainly produce a\r\n     considerable effect.\r\n\r\n     Think of the Prince of Wales introducing Lord Lothian into the\r\n     King's room when it was darkened, in order that he might hear his\r\n     ravings at the time that they were at the worst. Do not let this\r\n     fact come from you; it begins to be pretty well known here, and no\r\n     doubt will find its way to Ireland; but it is important that we\r\n     should not seem to spread the knowledge of anything which can\r\n     injure His Royal Highness's character in public opinion.\r\n\r\n     I think the best thing that can be done in Ireland is to let your\r\n     Parliament meet at its prorogation; and that you should then\r\n     communicate to them the King's situation, and the measures taken in\r\n     England. A similar proceeding might then be adopted in Ireland, and\r\n     your commission then revoked in the usual form by the Regent, which\r\n     I should think far preferable to any contrivances of Justices, &c.\r\n     Long before all this can be necessary, things will have begun to\r\n     take some more decided turn than in the present moment, when hopes\r\n     and fears make the opinions of people fluctuate from day to day.\r\n\r\n     Unless we are clearly satisfied (which is far from being the case\r\n     now), that the King is not mending fast, we shall certainly propose\r\n     another adjournment on the 4th. This will perhaps be opposed, but\r\n     if it is, we shall clearly have the opinion of people in general\r\n     with us on that point.\r\n\r\n     It is quite impossible for me to enter into the other discussions\r\n     in your letter, important as they are, for it is with difficulty\r\n     that I write this desultory stuff.\r\n\r\n     There seems to be a notion among Lord North's friends that he is\r\n     preparing to take a more moderate line, and more inclining to the\r\n     King than Fox's people. I suppose he has a mind to make a parade of\r\n     gratitude. He has not five votes in this Parliament, and yet any\r\n     appearance of difference of opinion might assist us.\r\n\r\n     If I am better to-morrow, I think of going to Stanlake for a few\r\n     days. I shall have the Windsor news as soon there as in town, and\r\n     will write to you from thence.\r\n\r\n     Ever yours,\r\n     W. W. G.\r\n\r\n     Your cypher is, as I feared, spoilt by the unequal extension of the\r\n     paper in pasting. In future, in using the old cypher, I will use\r\n     _ou_ instead of _out_, and _er, es_, and _or_, in the three places\r\n     that are now occupied by _word, blank_, and _ends_. The cypher may\r\n     be set by the first letter, which is written _en clair_, as _I_ in\r\n     this letter.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: The letter thus written in _italics_ is the key to a new\r\ncypher in which these communications were carried on.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Whitehall, Nov. 24th, 1788.\r\n     MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     The same contradiction still prevails between all the private\r\n     accounts, even those of the physicians themselves, and the public\r\n     information which they give either to Ministers or to the country.\r\n     At the same time, the medical people seem so confident in their\r\n     declarations of his not being better, that it cannot but shake the\r\n     trust which one should otherwise place in the accounts of his\r\n     improvement.\r\n\r\n     My head is by no means better to-day, so that you must excuse the\r\n     shortness of this.\r\n\r\n     Ever yours,\r\n     W. W. G.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD BULKELEY TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Baronhill, Nov. 25th, 1788.\r\n     MY DEAR LORD,\r\n\r\n     When I left London last Saturday, the accounts were not arrived of\r\n     the state of the King's health. He was much better on the Friday\r\n     morning, but relapsed in the evening. I am afraid it is a very\r\n     hopeless case, though much time ought to elapse before anybody\r\n     ventured to pronounce for a certainty; and the physicians, who have\r\n     been so warped by party, or by an anxiety to pay their court to the\r\n     Prince, as to venture to do so, certainly deserve the severest\r\n     reprehension. The meeting of Parliament was much the fullest, in\r\n     both Houses, I ever saw; and in the House of Peers, the greatest\r\n     decency I ever witnessed, considering the hopes and fears of each\r\n     party. There were but seven Bishops (among whom Chester was one)\r\n     present, which is a proof that crows soon smell powder. I took the\r\n     opportunity of coming down here to settle my private affairs, which\r\n     my sudden departure had left unsettled, your brother William having\r\n     promised to send for me in case there is no appearance of the\r\n     King's recovering before the 4th of December, in which case another\r\n     adjournment would certainly take place, or in case Government\r\n     should not contest the Prince's becoming Regent without a Council.\r\n     It will be with great unwillingness I shall return, as I wish to\r\n     remain here till the beginning of February; but if I find we are\r\n     all expected to stand to our guns, and that our generals are ready\r\n     to fight a battle without a compromise, I shall leave my dear\r\n     Baronhill, and all my comforts, for all pleasures of war's alarms:\r\n     marching and countermarching in the House of Lords, drums beating,\r\n     and colours flying, &c. I supped at White's the night before I left\r\n     town, where Pitt was in high spirits, and Selwyn uncommonly\r\n     ridiculous; in general, our friends seem to await the approaching\r\n     storm with the greatest _sang-froid_ and philosophy: the longest\r\n     faces I saw were Lord Hawkesbury's, Lord Sydney's, and Sir George\r\n     Yonge's. I heard for certain that the Chancellor, who was suspected\r\n     of being _rattically_ inclined, was firm as a rock, and that the\r\n     whole Cabinet were determined to _die_ together. Fox was either not\r\n     found, or averse to returning, although the Opposition were looking\r\n     out for him as the Jews look out for their Messiah. _Je crois qu'il\r\n     boude un peu._ Sheridan and Lord Loughborough are those who more\r\n     immediately correspond with the Prince, with which, I believe, the\r\n     old Rockinghams were much dissatisfied; in short, there is every\r\n     reason to think there is a division among them, which, however, a\r\n     sense of common interest and common danger may rectify before the\r\n     day of trial. Your sister Williams, and Sir Watkin, were in town\r\n     both crying up the affection, humanity, filial piety, feeling, &c.,\r\n     of the Prince, and lamenting the little chance of the King's\r\n     recovery, &c. The Nevilles were to leave town last Sunday, and by\r\n     being in the neighbourhood of Windsor, can inform you, if they\r\n     choose it, of the real state of the late and present behaviour and\r\n     conduct of _some persons_ in that quarter who are so puffed by the\r\n     papers and by the Opposition. In the changes and chances of this\r\n     mortal life, our Barony of Braybroke appears to have been secured\r\n     at a lucky moment. I left Parry in town, and I set Rose and Steele\r\n     to coax him a little, for the old grievance sticks by him, and he\r\n     wants much persuasion to efface the memory of it. Sir Hugh is here,\r\n     and complains much of never having had one letter answered since\r\n     Pitt has been in power; notwithstanding which, I shall take him up\r\n     if the battle is to be fought before Christmas. I am afraid more\r\n     rats will run, on account of Pitt's inattention to these trifles,\r\n     than on any other account whatsoever; indeed I heard as much in\r\n     town. Rose and Steele may laugh at such details, but they are\r\n     necessary; and the constituent will not believe the member's\r\n     assiduity unless he sees a real or ostensible answer. I gave my\r\n     L100 to the Westminster election, in consequence of a letter from\r\n     Rose; I could ill spare it, but finding others were dosed in the\r\n     same manner, I gulped the grievance.\r\n\r\n     I am, my dear Lord's sincere friend,\r\n     B.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR WILLIAM YOUNG TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Stratton Street, Nov. 25th, 1788.\r\n     MY DEAR LORD,\r\n\r\n     However, at a crisis of such national concern as the present, my\r\n     mind is impressed with its importance, and would communicate to you\r\n     the vicissitudes and opinions thereon of each hour, as leading in\r\n     the minutest variation to new consequences, and of the first\r\n     moment; yet I confess myself at a loss how to arrange these\r\n     _parvula quidam ex queis magun exoriuntur_, and give them their due\r\n     weight, by stating the deductions thereon as they appear to me,\r\n     within any compass of letter.\r\n\r\n     As to the fact on which our fears and speculations are to build,\r\n     the change of mere words in stating the malady, as daily announced\r\n     at St. James's, may be proper enough to keep alive the hopes of the\r\n     public, who will argue on mere words, in reality, within this\r\n     fortnight the King hath remained from day to day without any\r\n     variation in symptoms: so this very morning Dr. Gisborne told me,\r\n     as his opinion, resulting from conversation with his brother\r\n     physicians in immediate attendance. My friend Dr. Milman seems to\r\n     be of the like opinion. That _possibly_ His Majesty may recover the\r\n     perfect use of his understanding is not less believed than hoped\r\n     for: cases have been stated, more desperate than the present,\r\n     wherein the recovery hath been perfect. Yet much mischief is\r\n     already done, or rather the basis of mischief is already and\r\n     irremoveably laid. In future times, designing, ambitious and\r\n     profligate men may start the idea that what has been may be, and\r\n     in the desperate effort of factious opposition, even venture to\r\n     arraign the temper and health of mind, though it shows its perfect\r\n     state, and the wise measures of Government should put such daring\r\n     insult at defiance.\r\n\r\n     If the King remains a length of time in the same state, I would, on\r\n     such too probable circumstance, join my speculations to your\r\n     Lordship's, could I imagine any resting-place, or outlet, in the\r\n     labyrinth of cases and deductions which the subject affords. I had\r\n     best, therefore, confine my correspondence, and take up the\r\n     immediate matter and language of the mere day, unless I meant a\r\n     book rather than a letter.\r\n\r\n     The language touches on the hopes and views of partymen, and on the\r\n     interests of the country as complicated with the present\r\n     Administration remaining in power. My business calling me often\r\n     into the city, I speak as an eye-witness to the temper of men at\r\n     the Royal Exchange, and Lloyd's Coffee-rooms, never did\r\n     Administration stand so high in opinion of the moneyed and\r\n     commercial world: throughout the city, the fears of losing Pitt\r\n     from the finance make as much of the regrets of anticipation, as\r\n     the fears of losing the King from the throne. Should the change of\r\n     Ministry (too much apprehended) take place, it is thought that\r\n     Fox's party--to temporize with the public opinion, too strong\r\n     directly to meet in the teeth--will propose a coalescence of some\r\n     sort; but so narrowed, and in regard to Mr. Pitt, moreover, placing\r\n     him in such jar of official situation, that it cannot be in any\r\n     manner listened to. The refusal of the insidious offer is then to\r\n     be noised throughout the country, and a trial to be made to engage\r\n     the people \"to join with those who proffered a sacrifice of\r\n     enmities to Pitt for the public good.\" _My opinion_ is, that the\r\n     trial will be abortive, and the present Administration retire (if\r\n     so necessitated), merely to return to power on the shoulders of the\r\n     nation. The Opposition, I understand, foresee their difficulties,\r\n     and are exceedingly embarrassed, even supposing the Regent, or\r\n     Regency, to venture on the change of Ministry.\r\n\r\n     I presume to hazard an opinion that such Regent, or Regency, cannot\r\n     and will not risk a change of Ministry with so precipitate\r\n     declaration in favour of our opponents, as some expect, at such\r\n     eventful crisis as the present. It is natural for men's hopes, or\r\n     fears, to colour too strongly the contingency on which their\r\n     relative interests depend. Some hope too much, and some fear too\r\n     much. If the Prince of Wales is made and continues at the head of\r\n     Regency a twelvemonth, then indeed a revolution in Ministry, or in\r\n     everything, may be worked out of the occasions ingenuity and\r\n     ambition may have to take hold of; but here I am running into a\r\n     book, and to avoid it close my letter. From time to time I shall\r\n     write, almost from day to day, if aught occurs deserving your\r\n     perusal. Meantime, and ever, my dear Lord, in truest affection and\r\n     attachment,\r\n\r\n     Your faithfully devoted friend and servant,\r\n     W. YOUNG.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Whitehall, Nov. 25th, 1788.\r\n     MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     I am very sorry to be obliged to say that the account from the\r\n     physicians to-day, confirmed by the most accurate testimony from\r\n     private quarters, state the King's situation in the most\r\n     unfavourable manner, his disorder having returned with great\r\n     violence. I do not understand that there is any return of bodily\r\n     complaint, so that nothing can be worse than this intelligence.\r\n     From what I now understand, it should seem that some considerable\r\n     time must elapse, even after the two Houses meet, before any\r\n     decisive step can be proposed, as it seems now to be thought\r\n     necessary that some mode of satisfaction should be given to the\r\n     Houses themselves, by means of Secret Committees, or otherwise,\r\n     respecting the King's situation, and that after that precedents\r\n     must be searched.\r\n\r\n     Fox arrived yesterday morning early, having come in little more\r\n     than nine days from Bologna. He expected, it is said, from the\r\n     accounts which he had received, to find the King dead.\r\n\r\n     Ever most affectionately yours,\r\n     W. W. G.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Whitehall, Nov. 26th, 1788.\r\n     MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     I sit down to write a few words, because I know it is a\r\n     satisfaction to you to hear from me in such a moment as this,\r\n     although I have nothing particular to say.\r\n\r\n     The situation of the King continues to be such as I described it\r\n     yesterday; and Warren told Pitt yesterday, that the physicians\r\n     could now have no hesitation in pronouncing that the actual\r\n     disorder was that of lunacy; that no man could pretend to say, that\r\n     this was, or was not incurable; that he saw no immediate symptoms\r\n     of recovery; that the King might never recover; or, on the other\r\n     hand, that he might recover at any one moment. With this sort of\r\n     information we shall probably have to meet Parliament. I much hope\r\n     that the previous examination by the Privy Council may be judged\r\n     sufficient, without any further inquiry into the particulars of a\r\n     subject which one so little wishes to have discussed.\r\n\r\n     I have no other news of any sort.\r\n\r\n     I do not know, whether I mentioned to you in my last letter, that I\r\n     tried, but to no purpose, to make out that part of yours which was\r\n     written in the new cypher; my cypher, which you sent over to me,\r\n     being wholly spoilt in the pasting. I must, therefore, beg you to\r\n     write in the old cypher, with the alterations I suggested.\r\n\r\n     Ever yours,\r\n     W. W. G.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Whitehall, Nov. 27th, 1788.\r\n     MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     The accounts of the King's situation continue to be so much the\r\n     same as for the last two or three days, that it now appears\r\n     perfectly plain that we shall be under the necessity of bringing\r\n     forward some measure for an intermediate Government immediately\r\n     after the 4th; and that there can be no further adjournment.\r\n\r\n     The Prince of Wales has sent a letter to the Chancellor, desiring\r\n     that all the members of the Cabinet may attend at Windsor to-day;\r\n     but this I imagine (and, indeed, his letter conveys it), has no\r\n     relation to any other subject, but to an idea of moving the King to\r\n     Kew, where he can take the air without being overlooked, as is the\r\n     case at Windsor. I have nothing new to write to you on other\r\n     subjects, though I believe I shall have in a day or two; probably\r\n     by Sunday's messenger.\r\n\r\n     Ever most affectionately yours,\r\n     W.

GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Whitehall, Nov. 28th, 1788.\r\n     MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     The Ministers were all sent for to Windsor yesterday by the Prince,\r\n     in order to give their advice with respect to moving the King. They\r\n     were detained so late, that Pitt went to Salt Hill to sleep there;\r\n     and is not yet returned, at least not to his own house, so that I\r\n     have not seen him.\r\n\r\n     I had a note from him yesterday evening, to say that they had not\r\n     seen the Prince, he having sent a written message to them by the\r\n     Duke of York. It related to the removal. He says, that the opinion\r\n     of the physicians, particularly of Addington, who had been desired\r\n     to come over that day from Reading, was favourable as to a\r\n     possibility, and even a prospect of recovery, and clear for\r\n     removing him as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n     We are still in the dark, as to the Prince of Wales's intentions;\r\n     though what passed yesterday confirms my opinion. The general\r\n     language leans to negotiation.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Whitehall, Nov. 29th, 1788.\r\n     MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     I received your letter of the 23rd, by the messenger only this\r\n     morning, and have sent the enclosed, which, as you will have seen,\r\n     exactly tallies with the ideas which I have stated to you in some\r\n     of my letters. I shall write to you to-morrow, being Sunday, when a\r\n     messenger would of course be sent with the official bulletin, and\r\n     as you may very probably receive that letter as soon as this, I\r\n     think it unnecessary to fatigue either you or myself with figures,\r\n     especially as I have nothing very material to say, except a\r\n     confirmation, from my subsequent conversation with Pitt, of the\r\n     ideas which I mentioned to you yesterday, particularly with respect\r\n     to Addington's opinion, which seems to have encouraged the rest to\r\n     speak out. Addington told Pitt that he had himself kept a house for\r\n     the reception of these unhappy people for seven years. That during\r\n     that period, he had hardly ever had fewer than ten or twelve with\r\n     him, and that of all those one only was not cured, he having died\r\n     in the house of bursting a blood-vessel. He said that the symptoms,\r\n     as they at present appeared, were those of a morbid humour, flying\r\n     about and irritating the nerves. The physicians desired Pitt to\r\n     see the King yesterday, which he did, and found him, though\r\n     certainly in a state of derangement, yet far better than he had\r\n     expected from the accounts. It is not yet settled whether he shall\r\n     be removed, as he has expressed some reluctance to it, and the\r\n     physicians are extremely averse to any force.\r\n\r\n     We are still under some uncertainty whether or not to propose a\r\n     further adjournment; in the meanwhile we have thought it absolutely\r\n     necessary to summon all our friends, as without their attendance,\r\n     we should not even have the decision of that question in our own\r\n     hands.\r\n\r\n     Ever most affectionately yours,\r\n     W.

GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Whitehall, Nov. 30th, 1788.\r\n     MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     There is no particular account of the King this morning, He was\r\n     yesterday evening removed to Kew. There was considerable difficulty\r\n     in persuading him to agree to this removal, but it was at last\r\n     accomplished without violence. Pitt saw him again at Windsor before\r\n     his removal, and thought him rather less well in his manner than on\r\n     the preceding day. Addington's conversation is still such as to\r\n     show that he thinks the probabilities greatly in favour of his\r\n     recovery. He mentioned particularly to Pitt, that he had in his\r\n     house one person whose case appeared to him exactly to resemble the\r\n     King's, and that this person had been cured.\r\n\r\n     We are still much undetermined about the time of bringing forward\r\n     the decisive measures. The general leaning of people's minds\r\n     appears to be for delay, and there is not anything that can perhaps\r\n     absolutely be said to require that immediate steps should be taken.\r\n     There are, however, several points of foreign business which seem\r\n     to press considerably, and there seems little reason to hope that\r\n     this situation will be at all altered within such a time as it\r\n     would be possible to wait. I am rather inclined towards bringing\r\n     the business forward on Thursday; and yet I am very apprehensive of\r\n     the effect which might be produced by any appearance or imputation\r\n     of precipitancy.\r\n\r\n     When the Cabinet went down to Windsor two days ago, in consequence\r\n     of the Prince of Wales's letter, he did not see them, but sent them\r\n     a written message by the Duke of York, respecting the King's\r\n     removal. This message, whether accidentally or not, was couched in\r\n     terms that were thought a little royal. Some caution was thought\r\n     necessary in wording the answer to avoid the style of giving His\r\n     Royal Highness advice, or of acknowledging any authority in him.\r\n\r\n     You will have heard, in all probability, much on the subject of the\r\n     Chancellor. His situation is a singular one. It is unquestionably\r\n     true that he has seen _Fox_, and I believe he has also seen\r\n     Sheridan repeatedly, and certainly the Prince of Wales. And of all\r\n     these conversations he has never communicated one word to any other\r\n     member of the Cabinet. Yet I am persuaded that he has as yet made\r\n     no terms with them, and that whenever they come to that point they\r\n     will differ. With this clue, however, you will be at no loss to\r\n     guess where the Prince acquires his knowledge of the plans of\r\n     Regency which are to be proposed, because, even supposing the\r\n     Chancellor not to have directly betrayed the individual opinions of\r\n     his colleagues, yet still his conversation upon these points, in\r\n     all of which he has explicitly agreed with the opinions of Pitt,\r\n     must lead to the communication of the plans in agitation. I am,\r\n     however, rather inclined to believe that Cuninghame's correspondent\r\n     has taken by guess one out of a variety of reports circulated, and\r\n     that he has been right by accident. The general belief of the\r\n     Opposition certainly is, as you may by their papers, that measures\r\n     of much more violence are intended.\r\n\r\n     Pitt has been induced, from his regard to the King, to dissemble\r\n     his knowledge of Thurlow's conduct, and to suppress the resentment\r\n     which it so naturally excites. There is no reason, but the\r\n     contrary, for believing that any of those who have acted with him\r\n     are at all disposed to follow his example. It is universally\r\n     reprobated, and explicitly by them. I think you will do well, if it\r\n     comes in question, to do as I do, which is to avoid saying anything\r\n     on the subject as long as I can; and when pressed, to profess\r\n     ignorance.\r\n\r\n     There is no great inconvenience arising, in reality, from the\r\n     communication of these intentions to the Prince. His intentions are\r\n     sufficiently decided, and he has no means of traversing our\r\n     schemes.\r\n\r\n     We do not yet know with certainty whether he has any idea of\r\n     negotiation; but if he has, it is unquestionably only as a cloak,\r\n     and meaning that it should be rejected. But the prospect of\r\n     detaching the Chancellor may make this less probable, although he\r\n     may perhaps insist on something of the sort being done to provide\r\n     for his _delicacy_. The general language is universal and immediate\r\n     dismission. If I am not mistaken, a storm is rising that they\r\n     little expect, and the sense of the country, instead of being\r\n     nearly as strong as in 1784, will be much stronger. But the party\r\n     in general are so hungry and impatient, that I think they will act\r\n     upon the better judgment of their leaders, and prevent them from\r\n     doing anything which may allow a moment's delay.\r\n\r\n     Ever most affectionately yours,\r\n     W. W. G.\r\n\r\n\r\n     It was beginning to be suspected that Thurlow was about to _rat_.\r\n     His conduct justified the worst doubts. Sir William Young confirms\r\n     the intelligence about his increasing and suspicious intimacy with\r\n     the Prince of Wales.\r\n\r\n\r\n     SIR WILLIAM YOUNG TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Stratton Street, Nov. 30th, 1788.\r\n     MY DEAR LORD,\r\n\r\n     Since my last, all the intelligence to be given consists merely of\r\n     rumours and of opinions respecting the probable changes in the\r\n     Administration, on accession of the Prince to the executive\r\n     authority. The Prince, it is said, is wonderfully of late attached\r\n     to Thurlow. His Royal Highness hath not been equally gracious to\r\n     Mr. Pitt; and from the authority of a person who dined with him, I\r\n     am assured that his melancholy derived from the malady of his\r\n     father and King, is not of that deep and rooted sort for which \"no\r\n     physic of the mind\" can be found. Drinking and singing were\r\n     specifics on the day stated to me.\r\n\r\n     As to opinions alluded to above, they appear to me, who am not in\r\n     the secret, mere sermons to Shakspeare's text of \"Harry, thy wish\r\n     was father to the thought.\" If aught is settled, your Lordship is\r\n     undoubtedly apprised of it; if things yet remain for arrangement,\r\n     your grounds for mere fabrics of speculation must ere this be\r\n     better laid than mine; and so, in either case, I'd better e'en\r\n     refrain from the subject, until Thursday begins the course of\r\n     authentic matter for my letters.\r\n\r\n     Meantime, a word in regard to myself. I write under the greatest\r\n     embarrassment of mind, between pressing necessity of not moving\r\n     from London and a justness of sentiment which would particularly at\r\n     this moment urge my repairing to you at the Castle. When your kind\r\n     friendship conferred what, at that moment, was a most essential aid\r\n     to my family subsistence, your goodness added that I need not visit\r\n     Ireland oftener than the convenience of my family allowed. Of this\r\n     goodness I by no means thought to avail myself, and proposed this\r\n     winter proceeding with my wife and son to the Castle, and returning\r\n     to accomplish the passing of my \"Poor Laws,\" in February or March.\r\n\r\n     The loss of my father hath placed me in a situation wherein, from\r\n     the magnitude and delicacy of the concern, every hour may afford an\r\n     important crisis; and in which a single omission, a momentary\r\n     absence, may entail consequences irretrievable, in matters wherein\r\n     the result to me and mine is to be conjoined reputation and\r\n     affluence, or disgrace and penury. I cannot, under impression of\r\n     such alternatives, delegate an iota of conduct to a second person.\r\n     I have laid down a systematic plan of conduct for myself, which in\r\n     executing I am sure of honour and credit, have a certainty of\r\n     competence, and a prospect of considerable wealth. The more I\r\n     reflect, the more I am confirmed in the propriety of the grounds of\r\n     procedure which I have adopted, and I feel myself equal to the\r\n     accomplishment, as far as it depends on steady pursuit of a\r\n     well-weighed purpose. Obstacles, however, may arise, and\r\n     difficulties occur, such as I have _daily_ to obviate or to\r\n     surmount, in shape of impatient creditors, who, if they were not\r\n     led to just understanding of circumstances, would not wait two\r\n     years for a final liquidation of private claims, with an inventory\r\n     before them in the Commons of property to the amount of L200,000,\r\n     but would jump forward to their own and my loss. One of the two\r\n     years I have now securely in hand; the crop of 1789 being shipped\r\n     from Christmas to March, of produce all grown, and partly\r\n     manufactured. If Government leaves me the year 1790, at the close\r\n     of it there will not be a private debt, nor an article alienated of\r\n     security for public claims; and my gain of the income of 1788-9-90\r\n     is actually the amount of L45,000 clear gain, above the result of\r\n     immediate sale of the estates, which in ordinary course, or other\r\n     line than I have chalked out, would be the direct legal recurrence\r\n     for general liquidation of first public and then private claims.\r\n     _One year_ of this gain to _my residue_ I have already secured, the\r\n     second I have no doubt of, the third I have great hopes of, and at\r\n     the period thereof, the gross total of the Crown demand, without a\r\n     deduction or charge per centage, would scarcely necessitate any\r\n     sale, or but a partial one, should I wish quickly to clear all\r\n     away.\r\n\r\n     Having no reserve for you, my best friend, I have, in accounting\r\n     for my \"fixing myself on the watch\" in England this winter run into\r\n     these details; and further (which will explain them fully) enclose\r\n     a rough copy of my instructions to my attorneys in St. Vincent's,\r\n     which, when read, you will consign to the flames.\r\n\r\n     I have that grateful attachment to you, that I should yet scarcely\r\n     hesitate in hazarding a month's absence from home, did not I\r\n     anticipate that your friendship would rather chide than approve the\r\n     sacrifice. I am ever at your command, being, my dear Lord, in\r\n     truest affection,\r\n\r\n     Your devoted and obliged friend, &c.,\r\n     W. YOUNG.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe plans of Ministers are further developed in the next letter from Mr.\r\nGrenville.\r\n\r\nMR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Whitehall, Tuesday, Dec. 2nd, 1788.\r\n     MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     I have nothing of any importance to add to my letter of Sunday,\r\n     everything remaining here precisely in the same state. It is\r\n     determined to proceed, after Thursday, without any further\r\n     adjournment. A Privy Council is summoned for to-morrow, to which\r\n     _all_ the Privy Councillors are summoned; those of the Royal Family\r\n     by letters from the Lord President. The physicians are ordered to\r\n     attend, and questions will be put to them, to which they will be\r\n     to give their answers on Wednesday. It is then meant, that on\r\n     Friday, the Lord President in the House of Lords, and Pitt in the\r\n     House of Commons, should communicate these questions and answers,\r\n     but not as a message, from the Privy Council. We hope that\r\n     Parliament will be disposed to proceed, without any inquiry, by\r\n     themselves; but on the ground of the examination of the Privy\r\n     Council, a Committee is then to be appointed to search precedents,\r\n     so that it will be more than a week from this day before the\r\n     propositions can formally be made. They will, I believe, be nearly,\r\n     if not exactly, the same as I have already stated them to you. The\r\n     point, on the prudence of which you had doubts, is of such absolute\r\n     necessity, that I am sure, by a very little conversation, I could\r\n     satisfy you in a moment that it must be taken care of. It is\r\n     intended to say of the whole plan, that it is merely temporary,\r\n     adapted to the present circumstances, when we are obliged to act\r\n     after the King has been ill a very short time, and when there is\r\n     much uncertainty with respect to the nature of his complaint, and\r\n     an absolute ignorance as to its probable duration; that if, under\r\n     different circumstances, and after a longer and more defined\r\n     illness, Parliament shall think it necessary to make other\r\n     arrangements, that power must rest with them, which cannot, indeed,\r\n     be taken from them. This would, I think, cure your difficulty.\r\n\r\n     Pray tell Bernard that the sooner he returns the better, and that I\r\n     will engage to find him full employment.\r\n\r\n     Ever most affectionately yours,\r\n     W. W. G.\r\n\r\n     I hope Bernard is not necessary to you in Ireland, because I think\r\n     he is already seriously wanted here. He will tell you for what.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM TO LORD BULKELEY.\r\n\r\n     Dublin Castle, Dec. 2nd, 1788.\r\n     MY DEAR BULKELEY,\r\n\r\n     Many thanks for your very interesting and affectionate\r\n     correspondence, which I have not neglected from inattention, but\r\n     from anxiety, and from business, which you can easily figure to\r\n     yourself, and as easily excuse. Much of your Windsor anecdotes had\r\n     reached me from other quarters; but I could not, without very\r\n     accurate information, have given credit to details so very\r\n     unpleasant as some of those which I have heard. The messenger, who\r\n     will deliver this to you, is going to London; but I was anxious\r\n     that he should leave this at Baronhill, as I think it may be\r\n     doubtful whether you know that the new system of government is to\r\n     be proposed at the next meeting of Parliament; and that unless the\r\n     King's health should vary materially after the 28th (my last date),\r\n     there was no idea of a further adjournment. My brother will\r\n     probably have written to you, to press your attendance, and, in\r\n     that case, this will find you in London, as I shall order the\r\n     messenger not to leave it at Baronhill; but, if it should reach you\r\n     in the country, let me implore you not to lose this (perhaps last)\r\n     occasion of paying a debt to our master, which every principle of\r\n     private honour and public duty must make sacred to us. The only\r\n     object to which I look is, not to private power or ambition, but to\r\n     the means of waking our unhappy King, at some future period, to the\r\n     use, not only of his reason, but of his power. How this is to be\r\n     secured I cannot, in my uninformed situation, pretend to say; but I\r\n     have the fullest confidence on this head in Mr. Pitt, and if I\r\n     could imagine that he could suffer a consideration of private\r\n     situation to interfere on such a question, I should despise him as\r\n     much as I now love him. I can have no doubt, that as soon as His\r\n     Royal Highness is possessed of the power of dismissing us, we\r\n     shall feel the full weight of it, and to that you will believe me\r\n     most indifferent; but the subsequent scene must, in all events, be\r\n     so interesting, that I must wish every assistance to Mr. Pitt that\r\n     friends and countenance can give him. If this should be realized, I\r\n     shall not be long absent from you; and perhaps our Christmas pies\r\n     may be too hot for the new Government, if their folly and\r\n     intemperance should urge them to the steps which those immaculate\r\n     Whigs, Lord Loughborough and Sheridan, may suggest. Adieu. I am\r\n     almost too late.\r\n\r\n     Ever yours,\r\n     N.B.\r\n\r\n     Robert and I have made our peace. Pray carry Sir Hugh with you.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Whitehall, Dec. 3rd, 1788.\r\n     MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     It is now past four o'clock, and I am but just returned from the\r\n     Privy Council. The whole number that attended was above fifty,\r\n     including Lord North, Lord Stormont, Lord Loughborough, &c., &c.\r\n     Fox was not there, being confined with a flux, which he has got by\r\n     the rapidity of his journey. None of the Royal Family attended. The\r\n     physicians who were examined, were Warren, Baker, Pepys, Reynolds,\r\n     and Addington. The general questions that were proposed to them\r\n     were three:\r\n\r\n     1. Whether the King is now incapable of attending to business?\r\n\r\n     2. What hopes do you entertain of his recovery?\r\n\r\n     3. What do you conjecture may be the probable duration of his\r\n     complaint?\r\n\r\n     These are not the precise words, but the substance. They all\r\n     answered the first question decisively, that he is now incapable,\r\n     &c.\r\n\r\n     To the second, Warren gave an ambiguous answer; but said that the\r\n     majority of persons afflicted with _all the different species_ of\r\n     this disorder, recovered. An explanatory question was put to him,\r\n     which it took about an hour and a half to settle; whether, as far\r\n     as experience enabled him to judge, he thought it more probable\r\n     that the King would or would not recover. To this he said that he\r\n     had not, and he believed no one else had, sufficient data to answer\r\n     that question.\r\n\r\n     All the rest stated, though in terms more or less strong, that the\r\n     probability is in favour of recovery.\r\n\r\n     The time, they all declared themselves unable to speak to.\r\n\r\n     A question was put to them, to show the degree of experience each\r\n     had had in these cases. That of the three first appeared not to be\r\n     great; that of Reynolds more; and Addington stated the particulars,\r\n     which you already know, about his house at Reading.\r\n\r\n     On the whole, I think the impression of the examination was\r\n     universally more favourable than was expected.\r\n\r\n     After the Council was formally broke up, Pitt proposed, in\r\n     consequence of some things which had been thrown out by Lord\r\n     Stormont and Lord Loughborough, that it should be understood, that\r\n     any proposal for further examination in Parliament should be\r\n     resisted. After some conversation, this was acceded to; and Monday\r\n     settled as the day when these papers are to be taken into\r\n     consideration. A Committee is then to be moved to search\r\n     precedents, so that the motion itself cannot come on till Friday,\r\n     or more probably Monday se'nnight.\r\n\r\n     Ever yours,\r\n     W. W. G.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Whitehall, Dec. 4th, 1788.\r\n     MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     Lord Sydney sends off this messenger with the proceedings of\r\n     yesterday's Council. I write a few lines by him, because I know you\r\n     would wish to hear from me, although I have, in fact, nothing to\r\n     say.\r\n\r\n     Our situation continues exactly as it was. The prevailing idea\r\n     seems to be that of a general dismission, and of an immediate\r\n     dissolution of Parliament. How far the examinations of yesterday\r\n     may operate with respect to this, it is impossible to say; but I\r\n     thought the Opposition people seemed evidently struck and\r\n     disappointed with them. If they do dissolve Parliament in such a\r\n     moment as this, when the physicians concur in declaring the King's\r\n     recovery probable, I am persuaded the cry will be as strong as it\r\n     was in 1784.\r\n\r\n     There is a report, that before the Duke of Portland would consent\r\n     to have any communication with the Prince of Wales, he insisted on\r\n     an apology being made to him, for some very rough treatment which\r\n     he received at the time of the question of the debts; and that this\r\n     apology has been made. This, however, I give you only as a report,\r\n     for the truth of which I do not vouch.\r\n\r\n     I enclose you a pamphlet, which you may perhaps think worth\r\n     reprinting in Ireland.\r\n\r\n     I hear as yet of no rats, but I suppose a few days will bring some\r\n     to light; though I cannot help thinking that the examinations of\r\n     yesterday _donneront a penser a Messieurs les Rats_.\r\n\r\n     I have not heard from you for almost a fortnight, and am impatient\r\n     to know that you receive my accounts; and to hear your opinions\r\n     upon them as they arise.\r\n\r\n     Pray send Bernard back as soon as you can. I cannot guess what his\r\n     motive was, for persisting so strongly in wishing to undertake two\r\n     such journeys at this season of the year; but he assured me, that\r\n     he had no wish to stay any time in Dublin.\r\n\r\n     The list, which you will see in the \"Morning Post,\" of the Council\r\n     is accurate. It makes a curious medley.\r\n\r\n     James is come to town, looking very sturdy. He is now with me; and\r\n     has no other message to send, except to wish you all safe home\r\n     again.\r\n\r\n     Ever yours,\r\n     W. W. G.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR WILLIAM YOUNG TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Stratton Street, Dec. 5th, 1788.\r\n     MY DEAR LORD,\r\n\r\n     When I came home yesterday afternoon from the House, I wrote the\r\n     enclosed minute of proceedings--a practice I shall continue to\r\n     pursue until we meet, for your satisfactory information.\r\n\r\n     As to news, it consists in the rumour of a general change in\r\n     Administration. I confess that so hasty a step as is generally\r\n     talked of and believed, comes not within the scope of credit which\r\n     my mind is framed to. Political wisdom suggests a multiplicity of\r\n     reasons why the Prince of Wales should not act precipitately--nay,\r\n     why Mr. Fox, &c., should not act precipitately; unless, indeed, to\r\n     embroil the times, and seek occasions of profit and power from\r\n     their turbulency and vicissitudes, may be the plot of some\r\n     desperate men of the party. Of authorities for intentions of\r\n     change, my best is Colonel Stanhope, who, coming from the Duke of\r\n     Portland's the day before yesterday, mentioned that the arrangement\r\n     of the new Administration was finally settled in everything; but,\r\n     \"that they had not yet succeeded in persuading the Duke of\r\n     Devonshire to go to Ireland.\"\r\n\r\n     _A-propos_ of Ireland. Accustomed to speculate on historical\r\n     points, the _precedent_ seems to me eventful, indeed, on that side\r\n     of the water. The times, indeed, are perilous, and must be met\r\n     everywhere with wisdom and firmness. At all times, I am ever, my\r\n     dear Lord, in truest affection of friendship, your devoted and\r\n     obliged friend, &c.,\r\n\r\n     W. YOUNG.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Whitehall, Dec. 6th, 1788.\r\n     MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     I have great pleasure in being able to tell you that, in addition\r\n     to what you will have seen in the examination taken before the\r\n     Privy Council, a Dr. Willis, whose name you will probably have\r\n     heard, saw the King yesterday, and that his opinion is still more\r\n     favourable as to the prospect of recovery. I have but just seen\r\n     Pitt, who has been at Kew this morning, and saw Willis there. This\r\n     general information is all that he had then to mention; but if\r\n     there should be any particulars of any importance, I will let you\r\n     know them. I am much mortified by receiving half a dozen Irish\r\n     papers together this morning without a word from you, as the\r\n     speculations on your side of the water are by no means indifferent,\r\n     or uninteresting here.\r\n\r\n     The papers will have told you what passed in the two Houses. It was\r\n     too late for me to write; nor, indeed, was Viner's nonsense worth\r\n     sending. Fox looked ill, and spoke worse than I ever have heard\r\n     him. His object was to beat about, and feel the pulse of the House\r\n     with respect to further examination. I do not think he received\r\n     much encouragement; but they are so anxious to mend this part of\r\n     their case by cross-examining the physicians, that I am inclined to\r\n     think they will try it. This opinion of Willis's is some temptation\r\n     to us to allow it; but, on the whole, I think it better resisted.\r\n     I should be quite clear about it, if it was not from a fear that\r\n     some individuals may be caught by the notion of parliamentary\r\n     dignity, and that our first division may thereby be less favourable\r\n     than if it was taken on any direct question of party.\r\n\r\n     I send you a note which Wilberforce put into my hands. If the thing\r\n     cannot be done, pray send a separate and very civil letter about\r\n     it; because this Sir J. Coghill is one of his chief friends in\r\n     Yorkshire, and he particularly desires to be able to send him a\r\n     civil answer.\r\n\r\n     Ever most affectionately yours,\r\n     W. W. G.\r\n\r\nThe next day, immediately after this favourable report from a physician\r\nwhose experience in this particular branch of practice gave great weight\r\nto his opinions, Thurlow began to veer round again to the Ministry.\r\n\"Whatever object he might at one time have had in view,\" says Mr.\r\nGrenville, \"he has now taken his determination of abiding by the present\r\nGovernment.\" Thurlow, in short, was exactly the man the King believed\r\nhim to be, and always kept in the sun.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Whitehall, Dec. 7th, 1788.\r\n     MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     There is nothing particularly worth mentioning to you with respect\r\n     to Willis, more than what I told you in my last letter. He\r\n     expressed himself very strongly to Pitt as to his hopes of the\r\n     King's recovery, and said that there was no symptom which he saw in\r\n     him, or could learn from the other physicians, which he had not\r\n     seen much stronger in other people who have recovered. He has, I\r\n     understand, already acquired a complete ascendancy over him, which\r\n     is the point for which he is particularly famous. He had the\r\n     boldness yesterday to suffer the King to shave himself in his\r\n     presence. The King was much more composed than he has ever been,\r\n     slept uncommonly well the night before last; said in the morning\r\n     that he found himself much better, for that Dr. Willis had settled\r\n     his mind; and was remarkably quiet the whole of yesterday. The\r\n     account this morning is also, I understand, very favourable. I have\r\n     just seen a man who saw a note of Willis's dated late last night,\r\n     in which he says that he is confident the King would do very well.\r\n     He is to continue entirely with him, and to have the complete\r\n     management of him. The other physicians are, however, to see him,\r\n     in order to keep him in bodily health.\r\n\r\n     It is quite ridiculous to see how angry the Opposition are at the\r\n     report of the physicians, and particularly at what Warren said,\r\n     which, I understand, was very different from what they had\r\n     expected. They go so far as to say, that if Fox had been present he\r\n     would not have dared to give such an evidence. They hope to mend it\r\n     by a subsequent examination before a Committee of the House: the\r\n     object of Willis being examined is so great, that I think we shall\r\n     consent to something of this sort. Not only his opinion will have\r\n     great weight, but it will also make the others very cautious what\r\n     they say in opposition to it.\r\n\r\n     The behaviour of the two Princes is such as to shock every man's\r\n     feelings. What do you think of the Duke of York's having a meeting\r\n     of the Opposition at his house on Thursday, before the House of\r\n     Lords met, and then going down there to hear the examinations read?\r\n     After that, they closed the day, by both going in the evening to\r\n     Brooks's. The truth is, that the Duke is entirely in his brother's\r\n     hands, and that the latter is taking inconceivable pains to keep\r\n     him so, in order that he may not see what a line is open to him if\r\n     he had judgment to follow it.\r\n\r\n     The assurances of support which Pitt receives from all quarters are\r\n     much beyond the expectations which we had formed. It is also clear\r\n     that, whatever object Thurlow might at one time have had in view,\r\n     he has now taken his determination of abiding by the present\r\n     Government, and supporting their measures with respect to the\r\n     Regency. I imagine that Lord Stafford and Lord Weymouth have\r\n     chiefly influenced his resolution--their line having been clear and\r\n     decided from the beginning.\r\n\r\n     On the other hand, there seems great reason to believe that the\r\n     Prince of Wales is inclined to go to all the lengths to which that\r\n     party are pushing him. They have for several days been spreading a\r\n     report that he has expressed a determination not to accept of the\r\n     Regency under any restrictions or in any manner at all short of\r\n     regal power; and that the Duke of York was commissioned by him to\r\n     have declared this on Thursday, if anything had been said that\r\n     could at all have led to it. The story of to-day is, that the three\r\n     Royal Dukes have assured him of their resolution to refuse it if\r\n     tendered to them on similar terms, and that they have authorized\r\n     Fox to say this in the House of Commons. There is no knowing what\r\n     sort of effect this may produce with respect to the measures of the\r\n     present moment: that must depend entirely on the sort of turn that\r\n     the people in general may take upon it at first. But it is very\r\n     evident that by such a step the Prince will do himself a permanent\r\n     mischief which he will never be able to repair, and which we shall\r\n     probably all of us have much reason to regret. It is quite clear\r\n     that, having once proposed these restrictions, as thinking them\r\n     necessary for the interest of the King (and on that ground only\r\n     could we propose them), no other motive whatever can be a\r\n     justification for abandoning them, as long as there can be found\r\n     one individual or set of individuals who will undertake to carry on\r\n     the Government, and as long as Parliament continues to think the\r\n     proposal right and equitable. What all this may produce, God only\r\n     knows. Our reliance can only be on the discharge of what we owe to\r\n     the King in gratitude and duty, and in the decided manner in which\r\n     we have put all considerations out of the question which can\r\n     personally affect our own interests.\r\n\r\n     In the midst of all this confusion, and while his sons and brothers\r\n     are struggling to gain entire possession of his authority, the King\r\n     may recover his reason. What a scene will present itself to him!\r\n     and how devoutly must he pray, if he is wise, to lose again all\r\n     power of recollection or reflection.\r\n\r\nThe struggle was now beginning in earnest between the Ministers and the\r\nPrince of Wales. The point at issue apparently narrowed itself to the\r\nrestrictions; but there lay beneath this question of royal expediency a\r\ngreat constitutional principle, which was gradually developed in the\r\nprogress of the subsequent debates. It was not alone that Mr. Fox and\r\nhis party demanded the Regency without any limitations whatever, but\r\nthat they demanded it as a right; setting up the doctrine that when the\r\nSovereign, from any cause, became incapacitated, the Heir Apparent had\r\nan indisputable claim to the executive authority during the continuance\r\nof the incapacity, just as he would have on the demise of the Crown. It\r\nwas strange enough that this doctrine, which Mr. Pitt denounced as\r\n\"treason against the Constitution,\" should have been maintained by the\r\navowed champions of popular liberty; and that it should have been\r\nreserved for the Ministers of the King to defend the interests of the\r\npeople against the encroachments of royalty. Mr. Pitt asserted that the\r\nright of providing a remedy for the suspension of the regular powers of\r\nGovernment rested solely with the people, \"from whom,\" he added, \"all\r\nthe powers of Government originate.\" The language he held upon this\r\noccasion is remarkable not only from its constitutional soundness, but\r\nfor the perspicuity with which it states the actual question in contest,\r\nstripped of all disguises and evasions. \"To assert an inherent right in\r\nthe Prince of Wales to assume the Government, is virtually to revive\r\nthose exploded ideas of the divine and indefeasible authority of\r\nPrinces, which have so justly sunk into contempt and almost oblivion.\r\nKings and Princes derive their power from the people; and to the people\r\nalone, through the organ of their representatives, does it appertain to\r\ndecide in cases for which the Constitution has made no specific or\r\npositive provision.\" It will be seen that in the end the Prince of Wales\r\nwas obliged to abandon his claim of right, and that the steadfastness of\r\nPitt finally secured the recognition of the principle which placed in\r\nthe hands of Parliament the settlement of the conditions under which His\r\nRoyal Highness was to enter upon the Regency.\r\n\r\nThis glance at the subject is a little in advance of the correspondence;\r\nbut it will be useful as a key to the points of discussion thrown up in\r\nits progress. The fulness and freshness of the letters, written daily,\r\nand containing the most minute history of those proceedings that has yet\r\nappeared in print, requires such slight elucidation as to render it\r\nundesirable to interrupt their continuity by commentaries, except where\r\nit may become necessary to direct attention to some special matter.\r\n\r\nBoth parties were now gathering their allies around them, and preparing\r\nfor a contest which was not very creditable to the political character\r\nof the Opposition. In the meanwhile a third party was forming, which,\r\ntrying to reconcile hopeless antagonisms, ran its head against a\r\ncrotchet, resisting the restrictions on the one hand, and supporting Mr.\r\nPitt, as Minister, on the other, for the sake of his popularity and\r\ntranscendant abilities. This line of conduct is justly described by Mr.\r\nGrenville as \"absolute nonsense.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Whitehall, Dec. 9th, 1788.\r\n     MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     The messenger who carries this is sent for the purpose of\r\n     collecting proxies. It is, you know, necessary that they should be\r\n     renewed every session; for which reason I have desired that a blank\r\n     proxy should be directed to you, which I suppose you will fill up,\r\n     as before, with Fortescue's name. He is quite eager (especially for\r\n     him), and came up to town for the first day. I think there is every\r\n     reason to hope that we shall not stand in need of this sort of\r\n     canvass, either for the House of Commons or the House of Lords; but\r\n     you will certainly agree with me, that no pains are superfluous\r\n     when such points are in question.\r\n\r\n     I do not learn that there is any foundation for the report which I\r\n     mentioned to you of the round-robin entered into by their Royal\r\n     Highnesses. The partizans of Opposition are, however, still\r\n     circulating, with great industry, the idea that the Prince of Wales\r\n     has positively declared his resolution not to accept the Regency\r\n     under any restrictions whatever. I take this, however, to be\r\n     nothing more than a bully, intended to influence votes in the House\r\n     of Commons. If, however, he should be so desperate, I should hope\r\n     there would be every reason to believe that the Queen would be\r\n     induced to take the Regency, in order to prevent the King's hands\r\n     from being fettered for the remainder of his life. Nothing has yet\r\n     passed with respect to this subject. Pitt has seen her once; but\r\n     the conversation was nothing more than general, although with the\r\n     greatest civility, and even kindness, on her part towards him.\r\n\r\n     We receive every day new professions of attachment; and I do not\r\n     yet hear of any one individual of any consequence whom we shall\r\n     lose, except, probably, the Duke of Queensbury. The Duke of Grafton\r\n     has declared himself explicitly. There is no longer any doubt of\r\n     Thurlow; and there never has been any of Lord Stafford, Lord\r\n     Weymouth, &c. Lord Lonsdale is still uncertain, and so is, I\r\n     believe, the Duke of Northumberland--though this will have been\r\n     brought to a point by this time. The general idea is, that he has\r\n     connected himself with the Independents, of which there was some\r\n     appearance last session. It is said that they mean to support Pitt\r\n     as the Minister, but to oppose any restrictions on the Regent. This\r\n     is not the less likely to be their conduct, on account of its being\r\n     absolute nonsense.\r\n\r\n     With respect to individuals in the House of Commons, there are\r\n     several who have long been wavering, and who have sent the most\r\n     positive assurances of support.\r\n\r\n     There is every reason to believe that the country will continue\r\n     entirely with us, and that addresses will be presented from all\r\n     parts to the Regent, to continue the Government. I am afraid that,\r\n     in point of time, nothing can be done of that sort in Ireland,\r\n     without exposing you to much embarrassment.\r\n\r\n     I conceive that our Regent will probably be appointed, the Bill\r\n     passed, &c., &c., by about the 10th or 12th of January, and that we\r\n     shall then immediately be dismissed. You certainly must remain till\r\n     your Parliament has met and appointed the Regent for Ireland,\r\n     because there is no one else who can vacate your commission; and I\r\n     think the contrivances which you once mentioned for avoiding it,\r\n     are liable to great objections. Now, you will observe, that the\r\n     addresses from Ireland could not be presented to the Prince of\r\n     Wales till he was Irish Regent, and that it would be a very awkward\r\n     thing to have the people there addressing him to continue you in\r\n     Ireland, after you had declared your own resolution to quit it in\r\n     consequence of the removal of your friends here. I wish you would\r\n     consider all this attentively, because, if these difficulties could\r\n     be removed, it would certainly be very desirable that it should\r\n     appear as far as possible to be the united sense of all the three\r\n     kingdoms, as well as of both Houses of Parliament, and of the King,\r\n     that the present Government should remain; and that these Whigs\r\n     should recommend the dismission in the teeth of all these.\r\n\r\n     Willis sent last night a note to Pitt about his attendance at the\r\n     Committee to-day. In a postscript, he tells him that he thinks the\r\n     King better and more composed than he has been since he has\r\n     attended him.\r\n\r\n     Ever most affectionately yours,\r\n     W. W. G.\r\n\r\n\r\nA new question and a new embarrassment now arose, as to what was to be\r\ndone about the Regency in Ireland. It was natural enough that the Prince\r\nof Wales should be popular in Ireland as a _pis aller_, on account of\r\nthe known antipathy of the King to the Catholic claims; and it was\r\napprehended that the Irish Parliament, acting independently of English\r\nprecedent, would declare itself in favour of an unlimited Regency. The\r\nanxiety to which Lord Buckingham was exposed by this disturbing prospect\r\n(some people went so far as to cast the horoscope of an Irish\r\nrevolution), and by the delays in the receipt of intelligence, owing to\r\nthe imperfect and irregular means of communication existing between the\r\ntwo countries, betrayed him into some expressions of impatience, against\r\nwhich Mr. Grenville remonstrated with his habitual temperance and good\r\nsense, throwing out at the same time some sound suggestions as to the\r\ncourse it was desirable the Lord-Lieutenant should pursue. There are no\r\nqualities in these letters, wherever reference is made to the conduct of\r\npublic men in great crises, more worthy of unmixed admiration than their\r\npractical sagacity and complete self-control.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Whitehall, Dec. 10th, 1788.\r\n     MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     Your messenger having been, as he says, four or five days at sea,\r\n     has just brought me your letter of the 2nd. I cannot avoid\r\n     expressing to you the mortification I felt, on finding it filled\r\n     with complaints of want of communication. It is now more than a\r\n     month that I have written to you constantly seven days in the week,\r\n     with the exception, I believe, of not four days in the whole time.\r\n     I do this, not only without reluctance, but with pleasure, because\r\n     I think it contributes to your satisfaction, and because it is a\r\n     real relief to my mind to converse with you in this manner on the\r\n     subjects which are, in the present moment, so interesting to us\r\n     both. But I do it often under circumstances of so much other\r\n     business, as makes it impossible for me to keep any copies or\r\n     memoranda of what I write. I cannot, therefore, distinctly call\r\n     back to my mind the thread of that correspondence; but, as far as\r\n     my memory serves, I solemnly protest I know of no one fact,\r\n     opinion, or conjecture, that could be of the least use to you, or\r\n     could even satisfy your curiosity, that I have not regularly\r\n     communicated to you as it arose.\r\n\r\n     You seem to have mistaken some expression in one of my letters, and\r\n     to have understood that the proposition itself relating to the\r\n     Regency was to have been brought forward on Thursday last. You will\r\n     since have seen, that the preliminary steps require so much time,\r\n     that it must still be Monday, or more probably Wednesday next,\r\n     before anything can be moved. But you say that you have received no\r\n     communication of the extent or wording of that plan, so as to\r\n     consider its legal or political effect towards Ireland. On this, I\r\n     can only say, that long before the outlines of that plan were\r\n     finally settled, even, I believe, in Mr. Pitt's mind, certainly\r\n     long before they were at all agreed upon by the Cabinet, I\r\n     communicated them to you distinctly, and at length. There has since\r\n     been no variation in these. With respect to the precise wording of\r\n     the plan, I do not know that this is yet decided upon; nor do I\r\n     suppose it can be so, till within a few hours of its being moved.\r\n     But as to any legal effect which it can have upon Ireland, I have\r\n     certainly failed in what I intended to do, if I have not stated to\r\n     you a clear opinion, that no measure taken in Parliament here can\r\n     possibly affect Ireland any otherwise than as a precedent, which\r\n     every Irishman must think himself bound to follow, who does not\r\n     wish to separate the two countries. It surely could not be your\r\n     wish, nor would it be desirable, to attempt to pledge any Irishman\r\n     one step beyond that general proposition, that whatever is done by\r\n     the authority of the British Parliament as to England, must be done\r\n     in Ireland by the authority of the Irish Parliament; but that the\r\n     latter will grossly betray the interests of their own country, if\r\n     they do not adopt the English measure, whatever that may ultimately\r\n     be. I trust that we shall be able to carry the measure here, such\r\n     as I stated to you long ago, some time before your Parliament\r\n     meets; but if it should fail, and any different form be\r\n     established, I hope we should be the last men in the two countries\r\n     to wish to disunite them on this ground.\r\n\r\n     I cannot but repeat, that the expressions and style of your letter\r\n     have hurt me sensibly. I do not believe, that if you were living in\r\n     Pall Mall, you could be more distinctly or regularly informed of\r\n     what passes. You will, of course, hear in Dublin, as you would in\r\n     Pall Mall, an infinite variety of foolish reports, as is naturally\r\n     the case when every man has his own speculation. You cannot, I am\r\n     sure, think it possible that I can even enumerate, much less argue\r\n     upon, or contradict all these; but I cannot, at this time, after\r\n     some reflection, call to my mind any point of the smallest\r\n     consequence in our present situation with which I am myself\r\n     acquainted, and which I have omitted to state.\r\n\r\n     With respect to your own particular situation, I conceive that it\r\n     is not possible that things can be brought to the point of\r\n     affecting that for several weeks to come. The measure which is to\r\n     be brought forward here will, of course, meet with violent\r\n     opposition; and cannot, according to my calculation, be completed,\r\n     so as to put the Prince of Wales in possession of the Regency, till\r\n     the first or second week in January. I think as soon as you receive\r\n     the notification that this measure has passed in England, it would\r\n     be right for you to write a very short letter to the Secretary of\r\n     State, mentioning in a very few words the opinions of lawyers\r\n     there, that your patent can be vacated only by a Regent appointed\r\n     by the Irish Parliament, suggesting the expedient of Lords\r\n     Justices; and then desiring to know His Royal Highness's pleasure,\r\n     whether he chooses that under those circumstances you should meet\r\n     the Parliament, for the purpose of laying before them the\r\n     circumstances of the present situation, or whether you should name\r\n     Lords Justices, and who they should be. You see, I put this on the\r\n     supposition that you are not _immediately_ removed, which, for many\r\n     reasons, I think unlikely. You know my opinion has always been\r\n     that the Prince would not negotiate, and I am every day more\r\n     confirmed in it. But I think it may be a question, whether he may\r\n     not choose to look about him a little. Perhaps, however, in order\r\n     to anticipate any sudden step, you would do well to send a letter\r\n     such as I mention, so as to reach England a few days before the\r\n     measure can pass, and to be here ready to be laid before him when\r\n     he does accept. In a point of such importance, it seems to me that\r\n     it would be proper that you should have, for your own\r\n     justification, the written opinions of your lawyers on the point I\r\n     mention, but not to send them over here. I mention this as a\r\n     general idea; but wish you to consider it, because I am sure, in\r\n     general, the less you write on this subject the better, in order\r\n     that you may not give ground of misquoting, or misrepresenting what\r\n     you say.\r\n\r\n     As to the idea of vesting the Government in Lords Justices, or\r\n     taking any step for throwing up the Government in the interval,\r\n     except with the consent and by the direction of the Prince of\r\n     Wales, I should most earnestly deprecate it for a thousand reasons;\r\n     but, above all, for the impression which it would give here of\r\n     abandoning the interests of this country in Ireland, for the sake\r\n     of adding to the confusion, and creating factious difficulties. I\r\n     think your line clear, and that you have nothing to do but to sit\r\n     still saying or doing nothing till our measure passes. You then ask\r\n     the Prince of Wales whether he chooses that you or any Lords\r\n     Justices should meet Parliament; and if he directs you to stay, you\r\n     have nothing to do but to express to anybody that asks you, your\r\n     wish that the English measure should be precisely followed.\r\n     Whatever, under such circumstances, is the conduct of the Irish\r\n     Parliament, you cannot be responsible for it, unless you make\r\n     yourself so.\r\n\r\n     There is another urgent reason against your taking any step for\r\n     breaking up your Government: the King is daily getting better, and\r\n     has been continuing so to do ever since Sunday. Willis's\r\n     examination before the Committee yesterday, was all but decisive as\r\n     to the certainty of his recovery in a short time. I will send it to\r\n     you in the course of to-morrow, or the next day; but these are the\r\n     material parts. He is asked what hopes he entertains of the King's\r\n     recovery? He says he entertains great hopes; that if it was the\r\n     case of a common man, he should have no doubt of his recovery; but\r\n     in the King's situation, his own reflections on his situation, when\r\n     he begins to recover his reason, may retard the cure. (A good\r\n     lesson, by the bye, to the Prince of Wales, &c.) He says he cannot\r\n     yet affirm that there are signs of convalescence, but that there is\r\n     everything leading to it; particularly that the irritation has\r\n     almost entirely subsided, which must precede convalescence, or any\r\n     appearance of it. He is asked with respect to his own experience,\r\n     &c.? He says, that of ten patients brought to him within three\r\n     months of their being attacked, nine have recovered. That the\r\n     smallest time he remembers, is six weeks or two months from their\r\n     being brought to him; the longest, a year and a half; the average,\r\n     about five months.\r\n\r\n     With this account, it is not very sanguine to hope that the King's\r\n     actual recovery may take place before the measure can pass here;\r\n     or, at least, such a prospect of it as may make it absolutely\r\n     _impossible_ for the Prince, whatever his disposition may be, to\r\n     change the Government. If the amendment continues, it may even be a\r\n     question whether further adjournment may not be thought right,\r\n     though the inconveniences of this, particularly with respect to\r\n     foreign affairs, are so great that it must not be done but upon\r\n     very strong grounds indeed.\r\n\r\n     The nonsense about dissolution has been talked in England as well\r\n     as in Ireland; but I cannot persuade myself that it really comes\r\n     from Lord Loughborough. It has not made its fortune much here.\r\n     Anybody who had the smallest knowledge of the general turn and bent\r\n     of the public mind, both in and out of Parliament, would not have\r\n     broached so foolish an idea.\r\n\r\n     I told you, in one of my former letters, that I was utterly at a\r\n     loss to guess what Bernard's motive was for going to Ireland in the\r\n     moment which he chose. I stated my wishes against it; but I saw\r\n     that there was some mystery behind, which he did not wish to\r\n     explain, and therefore I pressed him no more about it.\r\n\r\n     Adieu, my dear brother. I hate writing anything to you, which can\r\n     bear even the appearance of complaint. I feel for the\r\n     disagreeableness of your situation at this moment: being at a\r\n     distance from the scene of events which interest you so much, and\r\n     from any conversation with those in whom you most confide. But I am\r\n     sure you will, on reflection, acquit me of any want of attention to\r\n     you on the head of communication.\r\n\r\n     I am much obliged to you for your anxiety about myself. I had a\r\n     slight attack of fever for a day or two; but it is now entirely\r\n     gone.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Five o'clock.\r\n\r\n     I am just returned from the Committee, who have finished the\r\n     examination of the physicians. The examinations of to-day are not\r\n     very material; but as far as they go, they confirm our favourable\r\n     hopes. Another account is just come from Kew, that the King has\r\n     continued better ever since the account of this morning, which is\r\n     the public one.\r\n\r\n     Pitt is to move to-day for the Committee of Precedents. Fox told us\r\n     he meant to say a few words against it, as unnecessary, but not to\r\n     divide; so I shall not go down again.\r\n\r\n     The notion of the Prince of Wales not accepting, seems to lose\r\n     ground; and all these favourable accounts of the King are evidently\r\n     strong grounds of argument for our measures.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR WILLIAM YOUNG TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Stratton Street, Thursday, Dec. 11th, 1788.\r\n     MY DEAR LORD,\r\n\r\n     I did not receive your kind letter of Dec. 2nd, until my arrival\r\n     last night from the House of Commons, when it was too late to\r\n     write, and the conversation which then arose was of so important a\r\n     nature, that it was not practicable or proper to steal a moment\r\n     from the debate, or to send a line respecting it ere it was closed,\r\n     and the subject took a decisive turn, which was after the post\r\n     hour.\r\n\r\n     To a friendship so dear and honourable to me as yours, and shown me\r\n     by so many instances of goodness, the best answer I can make is,\r\n     through life, by a return of grateful attachment, honour, and\r\n     disinterestedness; and in these, if I aught know myself, I shall\r\n     never fail.\r\n\r\n     Of the momentous business opened last night, I can only say that\r\n     _our_ astonishment is only to be equalled by the spirits we are in,\r\n     on viewing the grounds Mr. Fox hath abandoned to us and left _our\r\n     own_. Lord Radnor, who breakfasted with me this morning, told me he\r\n     understands that Fox's doctrine, \"that the Prince of Wales was\r\n     Regent, invested with full regal authority immediately and _de\r\n     jure_ on the incapacity, however temporary, of the King, and that\r\n     the two Houses of Parliament had no right to debate thereon even,\"\r\n     came from _that constitutional lawyer_, Lord Loughborough. Radnor's\r\n     further remark, that Fox, having on a former occasion sought to\r\n     trespass on the royal just prerogative, had now completed his\r\n     attack on the Constitution, in denying the rights of Lords and\r\n     Commons, is worthy observation. Talbot, who made one of my\r\n     morning's levee, told me that at White's last night, all was hurra!\r\n     and triumph. Charles Sturt and other youngsters took part at the\r\n     bar, to echo the \"Hear, hear,\" from Fitzpatrick and Burke, of\r\n     Fox's doctrine; yet the \"Hear, hear,\" was but little caught or\r\n     repeated, though given loudly. Looking back to the history of this\r\n     \"Man of the People,\" and to his present conduct, in despite of his\r\n     talents of logical discrimination, I begin almost to doubt whether\r\n     his weakness or profligacy is transcendant. Pitt's language was\r\n     most masterly and decisive; and has been done but little justice to\r\n     in the papers of this day. The general tenor of subject they will\r\n     give you, but what I have seen does not touch on the overthrow of\r\n     Fox's resort to the doctrine that Parliament was of \"Kings, Lords,\r\n     and Commons; that no two branches thereof could make _a law_,\" by\r\n     the just and constitutional distinction between the two Houses\r\n     making a law, and the providing or giving efficiency to the third\r\n     executive branch of Legislature in cases of defect, whatever it may\r\n     be. The report of the physicians being ordered to be printed, will\r\n     be out to-morrow, when I will send it, with a few remarks. Our\r\n     great days are to be Monday and Tuesday.\r\n\r\n     It will scarcely escape your Lordship's penetration, that when Fox\r\n     said recognition of the Prince's claim _de jure_ to be the sole\r\n     right and province of Parliament, implied an act of the House to\r\n     debate, and, if to debate, to decide upon. So idle is genius! I see\r\n     through the motive power: if Parliament has a right to confer\r\n     power, it has a right to say what sort of power. So far Fox's\r\n     penetration reached, and so he boldly denied the major of the\r\n     proposition; and then, in a puzzle for consistency of popular\r\n     attachment to good old rights of the Lords and Commons, and his\r\n     subscription to the pillar at Runnymede, run into the contradiction\r\n     of admitting the major in shape of _recognitions_. It is impossible\r\n     yet to foresee what tergiversation will take place, or how many\r\n     will sacrifice their principles to the rising sun; forgetting that\r\n     apostacy to honest principles requires that there should be a\r\n     transcendancy of merit of another sort--namely, of great ability to\r\n     be useful to make that apostacy acceptable or the object of\r\n     remuneration. Hating the traitor and loving the treason, is a\r\n     state maxim to be remembered by those whose treason is scarcely\r\n     ever to be regarded while themselves are the objects of civil\r\n     contempt. Yet some hold a language of _doubt_. One or two, whom I\r\n     will not yet name, I told if they had not made up an opinion, they\r\n     had better ask their constituents for one. It seems to me, that the\r\n     business must close in a resort to the sense of the nation. In what\r\n     shape such resort may _possibly_, I think not _probably_, be made,\r\n     is serious indeed. But the violence of the faction of Fox portends\r\n     every evil. Perhaps, however, and most likely, the resort to a new\r\n     election, may give us time to grow cool, and close matters there.\r\n     Adieu, for the day.\r\n\r\n     Ever, my dear Lord, in truth and affection,\r\n     Your devoted friend and servant,\r\n     WM. YOUNG.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD BULKELEY TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Stanhope Street, Dec. 11th, 1788.\r\n     MY DEAR LORD,\r\n\r\n     The scene here is a very busy one, and I never was so interested in\r\n     any public measures in my life as in the support of Mr. Pitt and\r\n     the King at this moment, looking upon it as my duty to do all in my\r\n     power to stem the torrent of profligacy which the Opposition and\r\n     _their King_ seem determined to hazard with the good sense,\r\n     decency, and character of the country. I really do see such things,\r\n     and hear of such doings, that my tolerant spirit cannot forgive,\r\n     and if you had not very good information of them, I should think\r\n     myself bound to treat you with them. The Nevilles, Fortescues,\r\n     Jemmy, and the General, being in town, we make a very strong corps\r\n     together; and we are sent to White's every night to gain\r\n     intelligence for our ladies, who are not a little animated in\r\n     favour of the good cause. Charles Fox and Pitt were at issue\r\n     yesterday in the House, when the former advanced the most\r\n     extraordinary doctrines, considering his former opinions in the\r\n     Whig Club and in Parliament on constitutional points. I hope the\r\n     nation will see what lengths he is capable of going when it answers\r\n     his purposes. I do not hear of many rats running as yet, except the\r\n     Duke of Queensbury, Lord Brudenell, and W. Gerrard, Hamilton, and\r\n     Sir Robert Smyth, but probably some more dirty dogs will follow\r\n     them. The Chancellor seems very sour and crusty, and certainly does\r\n     not like Pitt, but I cannot believe he will do otherwise than right\r\n     on this momentous occasion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     We sat yesterday till eight, in the Lords, and thought Lord Camden\r\n     imprudent in touching upon what had passed in the Commons the day\r\n     before, as it gave the Opposition an excuse for being violent; it,\r\n     however, had one good effect, that the Chancellor opened enough of\r\n     his sentiments to show that he means to stand by his colleagues.\r\n     His speech was not long, but one of the finest I ever heard, and\r\n     made so strong an impression, that we gave him a merry \"Hear,\r\n     hear,\" which you know is not very frequent in the House of Lords. I\r\n     think we shall carry the question of restrictions very powerfully\r\n     in the Lords, as I hear of no rats but the Duke of Queensbury, the\r\n     Duke of St. Albans, and Lord Rodney. In the Commons, a great deal\r\n     will depend on the state of the King's health at the time the\r\n     question comes on, and on the previous activity of Pitt and his two\r\n     secretaries, in talking a little to dubious friends, which they\r\n     have not time nor inclination to do, notwithstanding so much\r\n     depends upon it.\r\n\r\n     Adieu, my dear Lord. Our joint and kindest love and remembrance\r\n     attend you both.\r\n\r\n     Yours ever, &c.\r\n\r\n     Pray order your secretary to send me word of the number and income\r\n     of the tide-waiters' offices which you can spare me, as I have\r\n     dependants enough if they are as highly paid in Ireland as in\r\n     England. In the meantime I give you the name of John Thomas, for\r\n     one of them. Did you ever promote one Alexander Gammach,\r\n     tide-waiter at Belfast? Pray do before you quit Ireland.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Whitehall, Dec. 11th, 1788.\r\n     MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     You will, no doubt, be as much surprised as I was, to find that the\r\n     notion of the Prince of Wales's _right_ was brought forward\r\n     yesterday by Fox in the House of Commons. It was a matter of no\r\n     less astonishment to many of his own friends, who were by no means\r\n     prepared for the assertion of such a doctrine. One should lose\r\n     oneself in conjecture, by attempting to find out what motive can\r\n     have induced him to take exactly the most unpopular ground on which\r\n     their side of the question can be rested. I was not in the House;\r\n     but I find there was an impression on our friends, that in his\r\n     second speech he had rather seemed desirous of stating the\r\n     proposition less strongly.\r\n\r\n     Our present idea is, that it will be right, in consequence of this\r\n     debate, that nothing should be moved on the first day (which, I\r\n     think, cannot be till Wednesday) beyond the abstract proposition,\r\n     as maintained by Pitt; namely, that in every case of suspension or\r\n     interruption of the personal exercise of the royal authority,\r\n     otherwise than by death, the care of making provision for the\r\n     emergency rests with the two Houses of Parliament. These are not\r\n     the words, but the substance. A stronger question we cannot desire.\r\n\r\n     12th.--I intended to have sent this off to you yesterday; but was\r\n     kept in the House of Lords till it was too late. You will see by\r\n     the papers, better than I can pretend to retail it, what passed\r\n     there. The doctrine, as stated by Lord Loughborough, was not quite\r\n     so strong as Fox's; but is sufficiently so, to be reprobated by\r\n     every lawyer in the country. Even Erskine says openly, that he\r\n     cannot go this length.\r\n\r\n     The idea is, and some words which Fox dropped yesterday in the\r\n     House of Lords seem to confirm it, that whenever the report of our\r\n     Committee of Precedents is made, which will probably be to-day, or,\r\n     at latest, to-morrow, he intends to explain away his assertion,\r\n     into the mere statement, that the Prince has such pretensions to a\r\n     Regency as Parliament cannot overlook. Be this as it may, we are\r\n     determined to state the right distinctly, by a resolution of the\r\n     House, before we proceed to any other measures.\r\n\r\n     Fortescue has this instant been with me, to say that he has heard a\r\n     report, said to come from a considerable Oppositionist, that they\r\n     have resolved, in consequence of the examinations and particularly\r\n     Willis's, to accede to the proposed restrictions, for a short time,\r\n     reserving to themselves the right of contending for more, should\r\n     the continuance of the King's illness appear to give grounds to\r\n     expect that it will be permanent. I do not think this by any means\r\n     impossible, because the question will clearly go against them in\r\n     the present moment; and this appearance of moderation may give them\r\n     grounds at a more distant period. It is difficult, however, to\r\n     conceive that they can make up their minds to wait so long without\r\n     a greater struggle.\r\n\r\n     Only think of Fox's want of judgment, to bring himself and them\r\n     into such a scrape as he has done, by maintaining a doctrine of\r\n     higher Tory principle than could have been found anywhere, since\r\n     Sir Robert Sawyer's speeches.\r\n\r\n     I enclose the examination of the physicians before our Committee. I\r\n     am sorry to say, that the examination before the Lords is\r\n     infinitely less decent and respectful, and goes into a variety of\r\n     particulars, which, I am sure it will shock you to read, as it did\r\n     me to hear them.\r\n\r\n     Ever most affectionately yours,\r\n     W. W. G.\r\n\r\n\r\nI do not know in what manner what Thurlow said about Ireland will be\r\nrepresented in the papers, not having seen them. It was so enveloped,\r\nthat I, who heard it, could form no notion what his opinion is. In the\r\ndebate in the House of Commons, I mean, for your sake, to state my\r\nprinciples on that subject distinctly.\r\n\r\nSir William Young, in the next letter, reports what was done on Pitt's\r\nmotion for the Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR WILLIAM YOUNG TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     House of Commons, Friday, Half-past Five, Dec, 12th, 1788.\r\n     MY DEAR LORD,\r\n\r\n     Fox got up, on Mr. Pitt's having moved for a Committee to inquire\r\n     into the state of the nation on Tuesday. Fox explained away much of\r\n     the harshness of the doctrine of _right_ in the Prince of Wales to\r\n     assume the royal authority during the temporary incapacity of the\r\n     King; but left all the substance of the doctrine. He then spoke his\r\n     sentiments of what ought to be done, whatever the manner; namely,\r\n     to recognize, _or confer_, as others might say, _full regal\r\n     authority_ on the Prince, for the time of the King's incapacity. He\r\n     then called on Pitt to relieve the nation from doubt, and give an\r\n     opening of his plan.\r\n\r\n     Pitt, in reply, stated the point of law and the Constitution yet to\r\n     be at issue, the _substance_ of difference yet remaining, and that\r\n     such great question could not be slurred over. It must be decided\r\n     by Parliament, and should be the first subject of debate and\r\n     decision; namely, for Tuesday. It was a question for themselves and\r\n     for posterity. He then said, that the outline of his plan was, as\r\n     _matter of discretion_ and conveniency, to appoint the Prince of\r\n     Wales sole Regent, with no permanent council, with power to remove\r\n     and make his Ministry at pleasure, and with all other regal powers\r\n     necessary for giving force, dignity, and vigour to his\r\n     Administration; but with no powers that might be needless,\r\n     intrench on the Crown, and cause embarrassment on the King's\r\n     recovery, &c.\r\n\r\n     Our business for Tuesday, therefore, is the _question of right_.\r\n\r\n     Pitt stands higher and higher in general estimation. As I passed\r\n     the gallery to write this, Marquis of Townsend caught my arm, and\r\n     said: \"A glorious fellow, by G----, Young! His speech is that of an\r\n     angel.\"\r\n\r\n     Post bell rings.\r\n\r\n     Yours ever,\r\n     W. Y.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Whitehall, Dec. 13th, 1788.\r\n     MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     I must refer you to the papers for an account of our triumphant day\r\n     in the House of Commons yesterday. You will see by that, that I was\r\n     not mistaken in my opinion that the doctrine of the Prince's right\r\n     was not likely to be a very popular one. Fox found that by what he\r\n     said before he had offended so many people, that he was obliged to\r\n     take the very first moment of explaining it away; still, however,\r\n     he has left it in such a shape that we cannot fail of debating it\r\n     with great advantage. He intends, as you will see by his speech, to\r\n     move the previous question on Pitt's proposition, which he is\r\n     afraid to attempt to negative. After this recantation was over, the\r\n     day was closed by such a blunder of Sheridan's, as I never knew any\r\n     man of the meanest talents guilty of before. During the whole time\r\n     that I have sat in Parliament, in pretty warm times, I never\r\n     remember such an uproar as was raised by his threatening us with\r\n     _the danger of provoking the Prince to assert his right_, which\r\n     were the exact words he used.\r\n\r\n     You may conceive what advantage all this gives us, especially when\r\n     coupled with the strong hopes entertained of the King's recovery.\r\n     The account, as given at St. James's, is rather less favourable\r\n     this morning. I do not well know how to account for this\r\n     circumstance, as the letters from persons immediately about the\r\n     Queen continue as favourable as ever. I rather guess it to be\r\n     Warren's malice against Willis, who was yesterday put into\r\n     possession of many points which they had disputed with him,\r\n     particularly the right of signing the reports. I imagine he was\r\n     unwilling the first day of this to contest with Warren about the\r\n     precise words.\r\n\r\n     There is a report, which I heard yesterday before I went to the\r\n     House, and which Fox's speech appeared to countenance, of their\r\n     intending to acquiesce in the limitations, provided they are\r\n     established only for a short time.\r\n\r\n     The precise mode of carrying our propositions into effect is not\r\n     yet settled. Our general idea is, that the two Houses should\r\n     authorize the Chancellor to put the great seal to a Commission,\r\n     empowering the Prince to open the session. And that then the\r\n     propositions should then be brought forward in the shape of a Bill,\r\n     to which the Prince may, by a similar Commission, be authorized to\r\n     give the royal assent. We shall, however, in the course of two or\r\n     three days have reduced this to form, and I will then send it over\r\n     to you.\r\n\r\n     Ever most affectionately yours,\r\n     W. W. G.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe report alluded to above turned out to be true, which could be said\r\nof few of the reports that were so industriously circulated during the\r\nKing's illness. The Prince's party, finding it impossible to get rid of\r\nthe restrictions, were ready to enter into a compromise, and to agree to\r\nthem, provided their duration was limited to a certain period. A Bill to\r\nthat effect was afterwards introduced. But Ministers were not inclined\r\nto accept compromises when they had the power in their own hands to\r\ndictate conditions; and so the limited Regency scheme came to nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR WILLIAM YOUNG TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Stratton Street, Dec. 13th, 1788.\r\n     MY DEAR LORD,\r\n\r\n     The account at St. James's this morning is, that the King had a\r\n     quiet night; but that, on awaking, His Majesty was more unquiet\r\n     than yesterday. Unless something very particular is noted in these\r\n     official returns of the King's health, shall not in future transmit\r\n     accounts so inconclusive to such a distance. The disorder in its\r\n     nature is subject to intervals, and to variations which even a\r\n     medical inquirer could not build upon, without being a witness to\r\n     such vicissitudes of malady or having a recital of each minute\r\n     symptom, and that with comments. Each authentic account, more in\r\n     detail, as it comes to me you shall have; and then, too, the St.\r\n     James's note as a corollary.\r\n\r\n     After my note from the House of Commons--which, if your Lordship\r\n     can read, I do not think I now could, such was the haste of\r\n     scribble--Sheridan threw out the menace which the papers state,\r\n     with Pitt's answer; the comment on which is, in the mouth of\r\n     Opposition: \"Pray, for God's sake, don't put a question, and urge\r\n     it to a division, which will ruin our pretensions as Whigs if we\r\n     do, as we must do, divide against it.\"\r\n\r\n     On walking out this morning, the first thing that struck me, was a\r\n     long row of handbills, stuck from one end to the other of the wall\r\n     of Devonshire House; in which a few words of _Fox for the Prince's\r\n     prerogative_, and of Pitt, in reply for privilege of Parliament and\r\n     liberties of the nation, were not badly selected.\r\n\r\n     We are likely to have a conversation in Parliament, I am pretty\r\n     authentically informed, of even a more delicate nature than the\r\n     last; John Rolle intending to bring forward his old subject of Mrs.\r\n     Fitzherbert.\r\n\r\n     Rolle and Sheridan had a whispering conference under the gallery\r\n     for some minutes; the result of which, Sir J. Scott,\r\n     Solicitor-General, with whom I dined, said he understood to be\r\n     firmness on the part of Rolle, in his intention at a proper time to\r\n     come forward.\r\n\r\n     To our question of right, on Tuesday the previous question is\r\n     expected from Opposition; and that they will be stronger on that\r\n     point than any other, from having the timidity of some, co-operate\r\n     with the interestedness of others. The list on that day will be\r\n     worth marking. I trust we shall yet have a great majority of\r\n     Parliament who will not submit to be dragooned out of their\r\n     privileges and freedom by an Irish Brigade.\r\n\r\n     Grattan is every day under the gallery, not admiring, I hope, the\r\n     Captains Sheridan and Burke. I know not which side he leans to.\r\n\r\n     Adieu, my dear Lord. My wife desires to forward her kindest wishes\r\n     and best respects to the Marchioness, with your most affectionate\r\n     and devoted friend's,\r\n\r\n     W. YOUNG.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Whitehall, Dec. 14th, 1788.\r\n     MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     I received this morning your letter of the 8th, and am very sorry\r\n     that I am so hurried to-day as to make it absolutely impossible for\r\n     me to enter into the subject which you discuss, in the manner which\r\n     I should wish. You will collect from a former letter my general\r\n     notions upon it, but I doubt whether those may not be considerably\r\n     varied by the consideration which you suggest of being able to\r\n     carry more for the King by remaining, than otherwise.\r\n\r\n     I have had a good deal of conversation with Pitt on the subject. He\r\n     promises me that he will, immediately after Tuesday, discuss it\r\n     thoroughly with me, and enable me to send you his decided opinion\r\n     how you ought to act. I find, from what he says, that he apprehends\r\n     Lord Thurlow's opinion to be contrary to ours. This, however,\r\n     seems immaterial, except with a view to future support, and,\r\n     probably, cannot easily be brought to a point, as no Cabinet\r\n     measure or instructions can be grounded upon it. The idea still\r\n     continues of proceeding by Bill; and as we preface that with an\r\n     assertion of the right in both Houses, it must still be a\r\n     considerable time before any measure can come in question with\r\n     respect to Ireland.\r\n\r\n     I believe we shall word the proposition in a less abstract form,\r\n     and apply it more particularly to this individual case, still,\r\n     however, asserting the right.\r\n\r\n     The account is less favourable to-day, notwithstanding that of\r\n     yesterday. I saw a letter from Willis to Pitt, in which he said\r\n     that the King \"had passed the day calmly, and was, in other\r\n     respects, much the same as yesterday.\"\r\n\r\n     Ever most affectionately yours,\r\n     W. W. G.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Whitehall, Dec. 15th, 1788.\r\n     MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     I had yesterday some conversation with Pitt on the subject of your\r\n     letter, which I had received in the morning.\r\n\r\n     On the best consideration, we agreed that the line I before\r\n     mentioned to you is the best which you ought to follow; that you\r\n     should write a letter, to be delivered immediately upon the Prince\r\n     of Wales being Regent, to state the doubts, to suggest the solution\r\n     of Lords Justices, to desire His Royal Highness's commands upon the\r\n     danger of giving offence here, by the appearing to raise\r\n     difficulties in Ireland. This was agreed to be more proper, even to\r\n     the King, than leaving them to open the Parliament. Pitt has\r\n     received a very haughty letter from the Prince of Wales to Thurlow,\r\n     complaining of his general behaviour to him, and of his not having\r\n     had Pitt's plan communicated to him, and ordering Thurlow to\r\n     require him to send it to him in writing. Pitt has sent a\r\n     respectful answer, disclaiming any disrespect to him; but saying\r\n     that he does not think it proper to do this until the question of\r\n     right has been discussed.\r\n\r\n     It is reported that the four Princes of the blood met yesterday,\r\n     and agreed to refuse the Regency under any limitations, and this is\r\n     to be declared in the House of Commons to-morrow. I have reason to\r\n     believe this to be true. Pitt saw the Queen yesterday; I do not\r\n     know what passed, though I think he is satisfied.\r\n\r\n     I enclose a letter from Camplin, upon which you must decide. I have\r\n     not yet seen Captain Nugent, who has sent me a letter from you, but\r\n     his business is wholly out of our cognizance.\r\n\r\n     Ever most affectionately yours,\r\n     W. W. G.\r\n\r\n     When Pitt was at Kew he saw Willis, who told him that he did not\r\n     think the difference in the King's state within these last two\r\n     days, of the smallest importance. That this sort of fluctuation was\r\n     naturally to be expected, and did not in any degree diminish his\r\n     hopes, which are as sanguine as ever.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Whitehall, Dec. 17th, 1788.\r\n     MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     I have nothing to add to what I said in my last letter, on the\r\n     interesting subject of your situation and conduct in the events\r\n     that may most reasonably be expected to arise. It appears, however,\r\n     to me, to be of the utmost importance that you should not neglect\r\n     for a moment taking the opinion of the law servants of the Crown in\r\n     Ireland, with respect to the operation of a new patent granted by a\r\n     Parliamentary Regent here, under the English Great Seal, previous\r\n     to any proceeding having been held in Ireland. I have a real\r\n     confidence in Fitzgibbon's honour; but I think this a point of much\r\n     too great importance to yourself, to be vested on verbal opinions.\r\n     You may, and I think ought, both to keep these written opinions\r\n     secret, and to require them to do so; but as soon as you have\r\n     received them, you should, I think, transmit them to Lord Sydney,\r\n     to remain in his office. You will observe that the ground is now in\r\n     some measure cleared for you by the declaration of right, which we\r\n     came to last night, and which will certainly be agreed to by the\r\n     House of Lords. I expected to have been able to send you an exact\r\n     copy of the resolutions, but am disappointed. You will, however,\r\n     probably see them in the \"Morning Chronicle,\" if that comes out\r\n     early enough for the post. The first states the fact of the King's\r\n     present inability to attend to business, \"and that the _personal\r\n     exercise_ of the royal authority by His Majesty is thereby for the\r\n     present interrupted.\"\r\n\r\n     The second: \"That it is the right and duty of the Lords and Commons\r\n     (describing them as in the preamble to the Bill of Rights) to\r\n     provide the means of supplying the defect in the personal exercise,\r\n     &c., in such manner as the exigency of the case may appear to them\r\n     to require.\"\r\n\r\n     The third: \"That for the above purpose, and for maintaining entire\r\n     the constitutional authority of His Majesty, it is necessary that\r\n     the said Lords and Commons should determine on the means by which\r\n     the royal assent may be given in Parliament to such Bill as may be\r\n     passed by the two Houses, respecting the exercise of the royal\r\n     power, in the name and on the behalf of His Majesty, during the\r\n     continuance of His Majesty's indisposition.\"\r\n\r\n     I believe I have given you very nearly the words, which I ought to\r\n     remember, having employed very near the whole of two days in\r\n     settling them with Pitt and our lawyers.\r\n\r\n     Our principle is, that the King's authority remains entire. That no\r\n     legislative act can be done but with the formal sanction of his\r\n     assent. That no person can take upon him to give that assent,\r\n     except by the direction and authority of the two Houses, who have\r\n     the right, in the present emergency, to act for the King; but must,\r\n     even in doing that, adhere as nearly as possible to the forms of\r\n     the Constitution.\r\n\r\n     Fox opposed these resolutions, in one of the best speeches I ever\r\n     heard from him; but I think indiscreetly supporting and enforcing\r\n     all his old ground of the Prince of Wales's right. Towards the end,\r\n     he made a violent personal attack on Pitt, intimating that he was\r\n     desirous, through envy, to weaken the hands of those _who were to\r\n     be his successors_. This opening was not neglected by Pitt, but\r\n     laid hold of in a manner which enabled him to speak of his own\r\n     conduct towards the King and the Prince, and towards the country in\r\n     the present moment, and to contrast it with that of his opponents.\r\n     I never heard a finer burst of eloquence, nor witnessed such an\r\n     impression as it produced. But you will know all this better from\r\n     the papers.\r\n\r\n     The division exceeded our expectations. All the neutrals, and many\r\n     of the wavering people, and some of the most timid of our friends,\r\n     were against us, on the ground of the inexpediency of agitating\r\n     this question. You will also naturally see that something is to be\r\n     allowed for the impression of two Princes of the blood speaking;\r\n     one of them to assure the country that the Prince of Wales would\r\n     not urge this claim, and both beseeching, as a sort of personal\r\n     point, that it might not be made necessary to come to a division\r\n     upon the question. Still, however, the impression which the claim\r\n     itself had made on the country, was such that it was a point of\r\n     real duty to quiet people's minds upon it. But it cannot be\r\n     surprising, that under all these circumstances, and under the fear\r\n     of some unexplained danger, many people should be caught by a\r\n     previous question. I was a little mortified at finding our friend\r\n     Sir P. P. among these. I had no previous intimation of this till I\r\n     saw him in the division, nor have I had any opportunity of\r\n     conversing with him since. I am not sure that he did not think he\r\n     ought to have been a Lord of the Admiralty instead of Lord Hood. It\r\n     is either that, or his intercourse with some of the Independents.\r\n     On the whole, I think it better to leave him to himself, as I do\r\n     not think I have sufficient influence over him to do any good, and\r\n     the attempt might do harm. You know best how you stand in that\r\n     respect. We have certainly no claim upon him beyond friendship and\r\n     opinion.\r\n\r\n     Lord Lonsdale's people were against us, in consequence of a letter,\r\n     written by the Prince of Wales himself, soliciting it as a personal\r\n     favour. This, which I know _from authority_, may serve to give you\r\n     an idea of the pains they had taken. They were so confident, that,\r\n     on Sunday night, Fox assured the whole party, at a general meeting\r\n     at Burlington House, that he had no doubt of beating us. I imagine\r\n     that we are now sure of carrying our restrictions, and probably by\r\n     a larger majority.\r\n\r\n     Lord Loraine has separated himself from the Duke of N.; in\r\n     consequence of which, Rainsforth has vacated. We do not know who\r\n     comes in, but Lord Loraine says it is a friend.\r\n\r\n     Gerard Hamilton is among the rats, which is no small amusement to\r\n     me, who have frequently been abused by Pitt for my bad opinion of\r\n     him, at the time that he was swallowing toads _a toute outrance_.\r\n     There are one or two more individual members in the House of\r\n     Commons, but nobody of any consequence but the Duke of Queensbury,\r\n     which, though everybody expected it, is nevertheless a thing that\r\n     raises my indignation in no small degree.\r\n\r\n     The popular opinion shows itself every day more and more, and I\r\n     have no doubt you will hear of addresses, &c. Fox's declaration of\r\n     the Prince of Wales's right has been of no small service to us. Is\r\n     it not wonderful that such great talents should be conducted with\r\n     so little judgment?\r\n\r\n     Our mode of proceeding will now be to communicate these\r\n     resolutions to the Lords; and when they have concurred in them,\r\n     then to bring forward the plan; and lastly, to authorize the Lord\r\n     Chancellor to put the Great Seal to a commission to His Royal\r\n     Highness, to empower him to open the Parliament, and afterwards to\r\n     another (at least, _I_ think they should be separate), authorizing\r\n     him to give the royal assent to the Bill appointing him Regent.\r\n\r\n     You will easily see, that all this will be no very short\r\n     proceeding. In the meantime, the prospect of the King's recovery is\r\n     daily growing more favourable. Willis and Addington have both said,\r\n     _separately_, that his emotion at seeing the Queen for the first\r\n     time, and his subsequent agitation, instead of being discouraging,\r\n     were symptoms highly favourable. He is now quite calm; and at three\r\n     o'clock yesterday, the account which came from Willis was, that he\r\n     was better than at any time since his illness.\r\n\r\n     It will be ridiculous if he should recover just in time to give the\r\n     royal _dissent_ to the Regency Bill--which is not impossible. The\r\n     more probable supposition is, that they will just have time to\r\n     parcel out the spoils, to dismiss us, and to hold their offices\r\n     about a month; and so will end (if this should happen) the third\r\n     reign of King Charles III.\r\n\r\n     So little was said about Ireland, that it would have been an\r\n     affectation in me to have talked about it; besides this, I had no\r\n     opportunity of speaking that pleased me.\r\n\r\n     Ever most affectionately yours,\r\n     W. W. G.\r\n\r\n     What I mentioned in my last about the four Princes, I now _know_\r\n     not to be true with respect to the Duke of Gloucester, who has held\r\n     aloof from all cabal with them, and even declared in the House of\r\n     Lords that he had done so.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Whitehall, Dec. 19th, 1788.\r\n     MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     I am very sorry that this letter must necessarily be so short, as I\r\n     should have great pleasure if there was time to state to you the\r\n     particulars of our triumph, and of the effect which it has\r\n     produced, and which is indeed little less than miraculous. It\r\n     certainly exceeded my expectations; but it was so infinitely beyond\r\n     what our opponents had thought possible, that they are beat down by\r\n     it beyond all description. I hope you will hear all this more\r\n     particularly from others. I write now only for the purpose of\r\n     sending you the following paragraph from a letter of Willis's to\r\n     Pitt last night, which he showed me. W. is speaking of the effect\r\n     of the blisters. He says: \"From this, and from several other little\r\n     occurrences in the course of these last three days, I am more than\r\n     ever confirmed in my opinion that there can be no doubt of the\r\n     King's entire recovery.\"\r\n\r\n     I know the pleasure which this will give you, and therefore send\r\n     it, though in great haste.\r\n\r\n     Ever most affectionately yours,\r\n     W. W. G.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Whitehall, Dec. 21st, 1788.\r\n     MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     I have delayed writing for these two or three last days, in hopes\r\n     of being able to give you an account of the event of our second\r\n     division, which has, as you will have seen, been deferred from day\r\n     to day, and now is finally fixed for to-morrow. The adjournment on\r\n     Friday was necessary, on account of Pitt's health. He had entirely\r\n     lost the use of his voice by a cold, so that he could not have\r\n     spoken five sentences together, and he was in other respects much\r\n     exhausted. Our friends were a little chagrined at the delay; but it\r\n     was unavoidable, and will not, I hope, be productive of any\r\n     inconvenience.\r\n\r\n     Our next question is not a pleasant one. It turns on an abstruse\r\n     maxim of law, which makes it necessary for us to take a very\r\n     circuitous mode of doing a very plain thing. The necessity of it is\r\n     forced upon us by our lawyers, whom we could not otherwise have\r\n     satisfied, with regard to the second proposition which we have\r\n     voted. I am indeed convinced, that, in strict law, they are right,\r\n     and that the mode now proposed is the regular and proper mode of\r\n     doing what is required to be done. At the same time, it would have\r\n     been more agreeable to have had a more familiar and obvious measure\r\n     to defend in such an assembly as the House of Commons.\r\n\r\n     We shall probably lose some individuals, both on this question, and\r\n     on the subsequent question of restrictions; but we have some new\r\n     recruits, who were absent by sickness, or other accidents; so that,\r\n     on the whole, I hope the difference will not be considerable,\r\n     though nothing can exceed their industry in canvassing, except the\r\n     open manner in which they offer every sort of bribe.\r\n\r\n     We have some idea of making the restrictions temporary, by which\r\n     means they will certainly be much more palatable. You will observe\r\n     that almost all the physicians seem to point out the probability of\r\n     his recovering within a year or a year and a half, if at all. This\r\n     seems to afford a real ground of expediency, besides giving a\r\n     strong topic of argument for imposing the restrictions only for a\r\n     similar time. This point is, however, not yet determined.\r\n\r\n     The accounts from Windsor for the last week, though they have\r\n     varied, are yet, on the whole, less favourable than before. Willis\r\n     ascribes this entirely to the effect of the blisters, which give\r\n     him great pain; and Willis says _that_ is, on the whole, by no\r\n     means an unfavourable symptom. The effect, however, which these\r\n     accounts produce here, is injurious to us, and must be the same in\r\n     Ireland. Our solid ground of hope does not appear to be in the\r\n     smallest degree weakened.\r\n\r\n     You will see in the Opposition papers that they are beginning to\r\n     abuse the Queen in the most open and scandalous manner. I collect\r\n     from this that they have some information, on which they can\r\n     depend, with respect to her sentiments, and I conjecture that they\r\n     are such as we could wish.\r\n\r\n     If we were together, I could tell you some particulars of the\r\n     Prince of Wales's behaviour towards the King and her, within these\r\n     few days, that would make your blood run cold; but I dare not\r\n     commit them to paper, because of my informant.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe demands of the Opposition appear to have risen and fallen with the\r\nbulletins; and according as the King was better or worse, the resistance\r\nto the limitations was faint or violent. The conduct pursued by the\r\nPrince's party to obtain votes and strengthen their parliamentary\r\ninfluence, is not shown in a very favourable light.\r\n\r\n\r\n     SIR WILLIAM YOUNG TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Stratton Street,\r\n     Monday, Dec. 22nd, 1788.\r\n     MY DEAR LORD,\r\n\r\n     I should scarcely venture to anticipate a subject, the event of\r\n     which within twenty-four hours may belie any pretensions of\r\n     political sagacity, might not the difference of one day's post from\r\n     London eventually delay your receiving a letter for a week, should\r\n     wind and sea prove perverse, as when I passed my Christmas at\r\n     Holyhead. This, and the anxiety for intelligence, which must\r\n     necessarily arise from the suggestion in my note of Saturday,\r\n     induces me to pursue the matter I then opened, and the more\r\n     especially as the circumstance, I foresaw, is now more than likely\r\n     to occur. As I purpose closing this letter at the House of Commons,\r\n     and the last moment which the post may allow me, I shall have to\r\n     transmit fact in lieu of probability; at present, I state briefly\r\n     my grounds for the latter--namely, that the specific great\r\n     question, whether the Prince shall be Regent without any\r\n     limitations, and invested with the full prerogatives of royalty,\r\n     will be agitated and decided upon this Monday night. The turn of\r\n     debate and temper of the House on Friday, which induced me to\r\n     suppose such question might be pressed upon us, have induced others\r\n     to press it. This morning a printed paper hath been sent to certain\r\n     members, containing a motion for addressing, and an address at\r\n     length to the Prince, corroborating what Mr. Steele told me\r\n     yesterday, that _Fox's_ party had some design in view for Monday.\r\n     Letters having been sent in Fox's name to several members,\r\n     requesting attendance and _an answer_; and that Mr. Pitt had\r\n     written in like manner to such as he apprehended might be\r\n     withdrawing for the Christmas holidays, with the same unusual\r\n     request _of answer_. Two of these letters (pretty long), to Sir H.\r\n     Hoghton and to Mr. Pye, I afterwards had the perusal of.\r\n\r\n     The true friendly language, and which I openly hold, is that we\r\n     shall be stronger on the division than before; such language is\r\n     proper, because ordinary men consider numbers as a shelter for\r\n     their opinions and conduct, and some even consider it as the test\r\n     of truth. But this language hath not its origin in my judgment and\r\n     feelings. There are circumstances which impress great doubt on my\r\n     mind, whether the division can be so favourable to our wishes, as\r\n     was the last. Taking the data of the examination of the physicians,\r\n     the King's recovery therein presumed, gives a vantage-ground in\r\n     argument for limitations. But I am sorry to say this ground is now\r\n     shaken: the public is no longer sanguine in hopes, medical\r\n     gentlemen have generally conspired to render the object of\r\n     recovery much more doubtful at least, and the physicians about the\r\n     King have had dissensions and disputes amongst themselves. It is\r\n     now rumoured that Dr. Warren wishes to be re-examined. All this is\r\n     indeed not before the House of Commons, and the report of the\r\n     physicians is; I think, therefore, that though not so decisive, we\r\n     yet shall have a considerable majority on the premises; but even\r\n     for this dependant on other considerations--namely, how far\r\n     apprehensions of the King's actual demise may operate from, I\r\n     believe, the faithful report of the day, that a fever is come on,\r\n     and that for a day or two past the King has had a constant sweating\r\n     of the head, to which he was at no time before accustomed.\r\n     According to wishes or fears, men construe this crisis to portend\r\n     health or decease; the political effect in the alternative, being\r\n     in the first case uncertain, in the second case certain. The bent\r\n     of this is against us, as few narrow motives and personal\r\n     considerations may extend and favour the active spirit of\r\n     subornation which stalks in open day, with each hand full of\r\n     patents of honour and purses of money. Offers have been so prodigal\r\n     that not fifty years of patronage could accomplish the performance.\r\n     Those gentlemen who have rejected these kind tenders of service\r\n     speak openly, and no notice is taken. In these moments of public\r\n     curiosity, it may not be so well to trust names to a letter. I\r\n     could give you several.\r\n\r\n     The bearing of this letter is thus unfavourable to this night's\r\n     debate terminating _fully_ as we could wish, though yet I think\r\n     _for us_. Having thus far written, I shall pocket my paper for the\r\n     purpose of adding what I can at the House of Commons.\r\n\r\n     House of Commons,\r\n     Half-past Five, Monday, Dec. 22nd, 1788.\r\n\r\n     I dined at three, at a coffee-house, with my cousin, old William\r\n     Lawrence, who called on me; Smith, member for Sudbury, leader of\r\n     the Dissenters, joined us on the walk, and was of our dinner\r\n     party. Lawrence said he wished a compromise, a _limited regency for\r\n     a year_, and then to take up the business anew, if the King was not\r\n     recovered, on the other ground, and _he_ is a leading country\r\n     gentleman of their party, Smith is in an unqualified manner with\r\n     us; and Thornton, whose place in the House is next to me, being\r\n     equally staunch, I augur that we have all the Dissenters' interest\r\n     with us. Indeed, generally speaking, the House looks better for us\r\n     than I expected, and I doubt not our majority, yet thinking it will\r\n     not be great; indeed the House is not nearly so full as it was on\r\n     the late question, and the apprehensions I set out with of\r\n     temporizers and shirkers, as we called them at Eton, seem\r\n     confirmed.\r\n\r\n     Edmund Burke arose a little after four, and is speaking yet. He has\r\n     been wilder than ever, and laid himself and party open more than\r\n     ever speaker did. He is Folly personified, but shaking his cap and\r\n     bells under the laurel of genius; among other things, he said Mr.\r\n     Pitt's proposals could not be adopted, as gentlemen, as\r\n     _cavaliers_: the word will not be forgot.\r\n\r\n     Fox is present, but looks very ill. Pitt looks recovered. Your\r\n     brother in high glee at Burke. Burke stated the Chancellor to be\r\n     like to the God Priapus, and Pitt the carpenter. He run his idea to\r\n     a charming extravagance, and finished by declaring that \"he could\r\n     not be a votary to Priapus, the false God! _vid._ Horace, &c.\"\r\n\r\n     The question is an amendment of Dempster's, to follow; the Lords\r\n     and Commons, &c., determine \"to address the Prince of Wales, to\r\n     take on him the Regency, &c.\"\r\n\r\n     Adieu, my dear Lord. Your Marchioness in health, and a boy, and\r\n     yourself in all good that Providence can dispense, is the prayer of\r\n     your most faithfully affectionate and devoted friend, &c.\r\n\r\n     W. YOUNG.\r\n\r\n     Six o'clock.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR WILLIAM YOUNG TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Tuesday, Dec. 23rd, 1788.\r\n     MY DEAR LORD,\r\n\r\n     Never did any debate of nice discussion go off better in our eye\r\n     than that of last night: never was I more agreeably surprised than\r\n     by the result--having gained nine on our former majority. The House\r\n     was thinner by forty at twelve at night, than the debate before at\r\n     three in the morning. The shirkers I alluded to may now come in,\r\n     and we may augur our future divisions to be yet stronger and more\r\n     decisive: our rats having all shown their tails on last night's\r\n     motion to address the Prince.\r\n\r\n     Sir John Aubrey, rat-major, receiving his emoluments of the\r\n     Treasury for five years, and declaring himself unconnected with\r\n     any, afforded a subject of general laugh. Master Popham, Sir Samuel\r\n     Hurmery, James Macpherson, W.G. Hamilton, &c., &c., followed the\r\n     illustrious Aubrey. Fox, after Pitt's reply, and his own rejoinder,\r\n     paired off with Stevens of the Admiralty. The Marquis of\r\n     Lansdowne's friends, Barre, &c., were with us. Masham, voting for\r\n     the Address, declared himself not precluded thereby from voting for\r\n     limitations. Drake, on the same head, not to preclude himself, left\r\n     the House. We shall, therefore, have those _two_. Sir John Scott\r\n     spoke with such learning, truth, and uncommon energy of reasoning\r\n     and language, that he carried the House with him, and extorted from\r\n     Lord North, in particular, the highest compliments ever paid to a\r\n     lawyer in the House of Commons. I never heard Fox speak so\r\n     temperately, or better, in point of argument. Pitt, in reply, was\r\n     equally great. He stated, to conviction, \"the fiction of the law,\r\n     which admitted the application of the royal political authority,\r\n     when the personal was disabled, as implicated in the very\r\n     principles of hereditary succession, which otherwise would suffer\r\n     interruption from nonage, infirmity, dotage, and every contingency\r\n     in the state of man.\" Sheridan spoke very ill: very hot,\r\n     injudicious, and _ill-heard_. Rolle, whilst adverting to Sheridan's\r\n     speech, made use of a remarkable expression, and which seems to\r\n     hint some future acting up to the rumours of his purpose. He said\r\n     that in proper time, \"He should heartily vote for the Prince's\r\n     being Regent, _if_ the Prince had done no act by which he had\r\n     forfeited pretensions to executive government in this country.\"\r\n\r\n     Our resolutions being carried to the Lords, in conference this day,\r\n     on Friday next the Lords will debate thereon. Lords Townshend,\r\n     Romney, Radnor, and many other occasional opponents, I understand\r\n     to be decidedly with us on the second Whig resolution.\r\n\r\n     In speaking of our debate, I had forgot Burke, who, after I\r\n     finished my last night's letter, finished his wild speech in a\r\n     manner next to madness. He let out two of the new\r\n     titles--Fitzwilliam to be Marquis of Rockingham, and Lord G.\r\n     Cavendish, jun. His party pulled him, and our friends calling\r\n     \"Hear, hear,\" we lost the rest of the twenty-five new Peers, who\r\n     would all have come out.\r\n\r\n     For the King's health, the world is yet in expectation of some\r\n     crisis. The St. James's notes of last night \"quiet,\" or \"unquiet,\"\r\n     are disregarded, as too general, or as of course; and accounts from\r\n     ladies about the Queen, and from the physicians themselves, pass in\r\n     the greater circles, still mentioning violent intermitting fevers,\r\n     and profuse occasional perspirations. Having generally, in my last,\r\n     stated that the faculty had conspired to render the public less\r\n     sanguine, I mention to _your Lordship only_ what T. Warner, above\r\n     seventy years of age, and forty years first surgeon of Guy's and\r\n     St. Thomas's Hospitals, told me, \"Being at the head of these city\r\n     hospitals, he has been often called in to meet the physicians of\r\n     Bethlem, where a surgeon for scalping, &c., was required, and that\r\n     a madness after fifty, without a clear assignable cause--and that\r\n     cause to be reached by surgery or medicine--did not admit a\r\n     perfect recovery above one time in an hundred.\" The opinions of\r\n     many others of the faculty are bandied about; but, as matter of\r\n     conversation for your private ear, I give this particular one as\r\n     authentically coming to my own knowledge.\r\n\r\n     You'll observe in this day's papers, a meeting advertised of the\r\n     bankers. It is understood to be for the purpose of tendering W.\r\n     Pitt, on his going out of office, a transfer of L3000 per annum,\r\n     Bank Stock, or a principal of L50,000, in the name of the\r\n     commercial world.\r\n\r\n     Adieu, my dear Lord. Health and prosperity be yours, and be assured\r\n     that you have no one more devotedly attached than your most\r\n     affectionate and obliged friend and servant,\r\n\r\n     W. YOUNG.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Whitehall, Dec. 23rd, 1788.\r\n     MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     I received this morning your letter of the 18th; but am so much\r\n     engaged to-day that it is impossible for me to enter into it, which\r\n     I will, if possible, do to-morrow. I write now only to press again,\r\n     in the strongest manner, that you will get Fitzgibbon and Wolfe to\r\n     state all the particulars of the case, particularly as to the form\r\n     of the enrolment of your patent under the Irish Great Seal, and to\r\n     give you their opinions and arguments upon it. I will then take\r\n     care to know Kenyon's sentiments on that paper, and if I can, the\r\n     Chancellor's; but you are not ignorant of the bias of his mind,\r\n     which is, on all occasions, to consider the relative situation of\r\n     the two kingdoms, not such as it is, but such as it was, and as he\r\n     thought it should have remained. My idea of your tie by no means\r\n     went to your pledging yourself to do any act so contrary to your\r\n     duty and feelings, as the recommending from the throne, in\r\n     Ireland, a form of Regency varying one iota from that adopted here.\r\n     On the contrary, I think you should give it explicitly to be\r\n     understood, that everything in your power will be done to preserve\r\n     entire this link of connection. And under this explanation only, do\r\n     I think you ought to offer the proposed alternative.\r\n\r\n     I say nothing of our triumph last night. You will hear it from\r\n     other quarters; and you will probably be able to judge of its\r\n     extent, by knowing the confidence with which the enemy looked to\r\n     gaining upon us on this occasion. It is, I think, now quite certain\r\n     that we shall carry our restrictions.\r\n\r\n     Ever most affectionately yours,\r\n     W. W. G.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother letter upon the Irish difficulty, into which Mr. Grenville\r\nenters in elaborate detail:\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Whitehall, Dec. 25th, 1788.\r\n     MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     I am extremely anxious that you should lose no time in transmitting\r\n     over to England an exact statement of the case respecting your\r\n     commission, and of the points and arguments on which your lawyers\r\n     ground their opinions, in order that they may be well considered\r\n     here by those who are interested in your situation and character,\r\n     as deeply and as warmly as Pitt and myself. You mention in your\r\n     last, that it has occurred to you, that it would be right _if you\r\n     are_ intemperately removed to desire the opinion of our judges on\r\n     the point. But you do not seem to consider that, whenever that case\r\n     occurs, you may have to decide _on the moment_, either to quit your\r\n     Government, and to swear in the new Lord-Lieutenant, or to hold it\r\n     against him, in contradiction to the orders of English Government.\r\n     Suppose he should himself be the messenger of his own appointment,\r\n     as was the case with the Duke of Portland. The same reason exactly\r\n     exists for it now as before, namely, the fear of suffering the\r\n     dismissed Lord-Lieutenant to meet the Parliament, especially in a\r\n     moment when their conduct is so important. The best and, indeed,\r\n     almost only security that you could have in such a case for the\r\n     justification of your own conduct, whatever it might be, would be\r\n     the having given a full previous intimation to the English\r\n     Government of the difficulties and dangers of the case.\r\n\r\n     You say that I should feel myself at liberty to act for you on the\r\n     pressure of any unforeseen case. I certainly should; and my\r\n     confidence in your affection, and in your persuasion of my desire\r\n     to do the best for you, would encourage me to take, if it were\r\n     absolutely necessary, steps even of considerable delicacy and\r\n     difficulty. But I cannot but be infinitely anxious, as far as\r\n     possible, to be previously in possession of your ideas on every\r\n     case that can be foreseen. Besides this, I am at present unable to\r\n     do the precise thing which I think would be the most desirable,\r\n     because I am not myself in possession of the particular forms of\r\n     your commission's passing in England and in Ireland, so as to be\r\n     able to state them to others. And yet this is the point on which,\r\n     in one view of the case, the whole question turns. I confess that,\r\n     in my own individual opinion, there is another point distinct from\r\n     that of forms, on which I should be disposed to maintain the\r\n     incompetence of any English revocation of your commission. It is\r\n     this:\r\n\r\n     _We_ (that is Pitt and his friends) hold and have persuaded\r\n     Parliament to declare that, in such a case as the present, the\r\n     right of providing for the emergency rests in the two Houses, not\r\n     as branches of the Legislature, but as a full and free\r\n     representative of all the orders and classes of the people of Great\r\n     Britain. Now the moment that we admit this, we do it on the ground\r\n     of this being a case unprovided for. If it is so in England, it is\r\n     unquestionably equally unprovided for in Ireland; and the right of\r\n     making such provision must of necessity rest in the same manner in\r\n     the Lords and Commons of England. There is this difference, that\r\n     here the Parliament could not be legally opened, unless the Lord\r\n     Chancellor had taken upon himself to put the Great Seal to a\r\n     commission for that purpose, whereas your commission enables you\r\n     (as I understand) generally to open and hold Parliament. But even\r\n     in your case, it seems to me to be a doubt whether you can\r\n     regularly do this without having received the King's pleasure for\r\n     it, and whether your opening the Parliament in such circumstances\r\n     is not an act very much of the same nature as the Chancellor's\r\n     would have been if he had sealed such a commission.\r\n\r\n     In the same view of the subject, I should most earnestly deprecate\r\n     your taking upon yourself to issue a further prorogation. Surely,\r\n     under such circumstances as the present, the two Houses should\r\n     themselves decide, and not any individual for them, whether it is\r\n     expedient or not to proceed to any business. My clear and decided\r\n     opinion on that subject is, that you should go down on the day of\r\n     meeting, and state the circumstances of the case, saying that you\r\n     have ordered the several examinations of the physicians before\r\n     Council and before the two Houses here, to be laid before the two\r\n     Houses. Your Ministers should then, upon that, propose to adjourn\r\n     to a further day, on the ground of its not being known (as it\r\n     cannot then be known) what form will be adopted here, and of its\r\n     being, at all events, desirable that they should be in possession\r\n     of that fact before they deliberate, especially as the Government\r\n     may go on in the interval without inconvenience.\r\n\r\n     If you see no objection to this, it is, I think, high time that you\r\n     should write an official letter, stating all the circumstances of\r\n     the situation, and that your intention is, unless you should be\r\n     informed that it appears to His Majesty's servants to be improper,\r\n     &c., to meet the Parliament on the 20th, for the purpose which I\r\n     have stated.\r\n\r\n     It is excessively important that you should, at the same time,\r\n     transmit, either publicly or privately, such a case as I have\r\n     mentioned, considering the subject in the two points of view:\r\n     first, with respect to the particular forms; and secondly, to the\r\n     question, how far any difference in point of form can preclude the\r\n     Parliament of Ireland from the exercise of the same substantive\r\n     right as that which we have declared to vest in us under the\r\n     existing circumstances.\r\n\r\n     I have great doubts of the propriety of what you mention of an\r\n     address of the two Houses to empower you to give the royal assent\r\n     to any Bills, because that would prematurely, as it seems to me,\r\n     bring into discussion the great question of all--namely, how far\r\n     the Lords and Commons of Ireland have the right, either of\r\n     commanding the use of the _English Great Seal_, or of superseding\r\n     its use, in an instance in which _that_, and the concurrence of the\r\n     _English Council_, are fundamental points of the present\r\n     constitution of Ireland. I am quite sure that the safest of all\r\n     things will be the adjournment; and I think it very improbable that\r\n     such a proposal can be opposed, as it must extremely fall in with\r\n     the wishes of the party who are looking to the Government\r\n     immediately after the passing the English Bill. I have no means of\r\n     knowing or guessing at General Pitt's intentions, but should think\r\n     they can be no other than _royal_.\r\n\r\n     You could surely find no difficulty in pledging the servants of\r\n     Government in Ireland to the adjournment; because it can so clearly\r\n     be argued not to preclude any future opinion on the subject, and\r\n     still less to pledge anybody to the adoption of the English system;\r\n     but only shows the opinion of the Irish Parliament, that a\r\n     knowledge of the system adopted here, is a point which they wish\r\n     should enter into their deliberations respecting Ireland.\r\n\r\n     I am much amused with the circumstance of Lord Sh. and Lord T.\r\n     having sent their proxies, as it has answered no other purpose but\r\n     that of pledging them; for it now seems to be agreed, that no use\r\n     can be made of proxies in a case where the Parliament does not\r\n     legally meet, but is rather to be considered as an extraordinary\r\n     assembly of the same persons who constitute the two Houses of\r\n     Parliament. It is something more than a Convention, and something\r\n     less than a Parliament.\r\n\r\n     Our triumph here is very great. The indignation of the two Princes\r\n     is, by what I hear, beyond all measure or bounds. The steadiness of\r\n     the House of Commons on this occasion is no bad lesson to them, and\r\n     I believe they will long remember it.\r\n\r\n     Ever yours,\r\n     W. W. G.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the House of Peers, Ministers did not come off so triumphantly. Lord\r\nBulkeley communicates the result, and enumerates the _rats_.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD BULKELEY TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Dec. 27th, 1788.\r\n     MY DEAR LORD,\r\n\r\n     We divided last night at half-past twelve; our majority was 33, the\r\n     members being 99 to 66, which in the House of Peers was certainly a\r\n     large minority. The rat Peers were Duke of Queensbury, Marquis of\r\n     Lothian, Bishop Watson, Lord Malmesbury, Earl of Abergavenny, Lord\r\n     Chedworth, Lord Audley, Lord Eglinton; and all of the armed\r\n     neutrality, who are: Duke of Northumberland, Lord Rawdon, Lord\r\n     Selkirk, Lord Breadalbane, Lord Hawke, Lord Kinnaird, Lord\r\n     Shaftesbury, Lord Huntingdon; Lord Lonsdale absent; Lord Lansdowne\r\n     with us, and spoke better than I ever heard him in my life, fewer\r\n     flourishes, and less rhodomontade. The Chancellor spoke\r\n     incomparably; and did give it Lord Loughborough and Lord Rawdon\r\n     most completely, particularly the former, who felt it. We are in\r\n     good spirits, for we fall with _eclat_, and high in public\r\n     estimation. I have no time to add more; but that I am yours\r\n     affectionately,\r\n\r\n     B.\r\n\r\n     The Opposition are in great hopes of a _riot_ in the Irish\r\n     Parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Whitehall, Dec. 28th, 1788.\r\n     MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     The messenger carries with him, as usual, the account received\r\n     to-day from Kew. I do not know that I have anything material to\r\n     write in addition to my former letters. I stated to you on Friday,\r\n     at length, the strong objections which both Pitt and myself feel\r\n     against your idea of proroguing the Parliament. If any accident\r\n     should detain that letter till after you receive this, I hope you\r\n     will take no step of that sort till you have received that letter,\r\n     and seriously considered the nature of our objections, which seem\r\n     to me to be of the utmost importance.\r\n\r\n     The belief that the Prince of Wales will certainly accept seems to\r\n     gain ground. It is most probable that we shall be enabled to speak\r\n     with more certainty on this subject in the course of to-morrow, as\r\n     a letter is to be written to him to-day by the Ministers, stating\r\n     the outlines of their plan. It will not materially differ from what\r\n     I originally stated to you. Peerages, grants for life (with the\r\n     necessary exceptions), and reversions, are to be restricted for a\r\n     certain time, which will be about a year and a half. This time is\r\n     fixed in consequence of what you will observe in the evidence both\r\n     of Willis and Addington, who both state the recovery as infinitely,\r\n     and beyond all calculation, less probable if it does not take place\r\n     within that time. Some line is to be drawn with respect to the\r\n     King's household, but what that shall be is the subject of this\r\n     morning's deliberation. It is a point of delicacy and difficulty.\r\n     The entire custody, management, and government of the King's\r\n     person; the appointment, &c., of his physicians, and the regulation\r\n     of his actual family, &c., is to be vested in the Queen, with the\r\n     advice of a Council, to be named and removable by her. The idea of\r\n     a Council of Regency to assist the Prince, but to be removable by\r\n     him, seems to be given up.\r\n\r\n     Our division in the House of Lords, though sufficiently decisive,\r\n     was less than it would have been, owing to a variety of accidental\r\n     circumstances. There is every reason to believe that we shall\r\n     divide stronger on Monday. I have no apprehension whatever as to\r\n     the carrying our restrictions in the House of Commons. Accidental\r\n     circumstances may vary our majority from 50 to 80; but there can be\r\n     no doubt of success. There seems very little reason to believe that\r\n     they will venture to dissolve Parliament till March or April, if\r\n     they do it then, which I doubt.\r\n\r\n     There certainly never was in this country, at any period, such a\r\n     situation as Mr. Pitt's. It is no small addition to the\r\n     satisfaction which we derive from all these events, to observe that\r\n     every man of all parties seems to feel how well the game has been\r\n     played on our side, and how ridiculously it has been mismanaged by\r\n     our opponents. Add to this, that they are all quarrelling amongst\r\n     themselves, and that we were never so united as at this moment.\r\n     With all these reflections you will own that _the prospect before\r\n     us_ is not an unpleasing one. The opinion of Willis continues as\r\n     sanguine as ever.\r\n\r\n     Believe me, my dear brother,\r\n     Most sincerely and affectionately yours,\r\n     W. W. G.\r\n\r\nLord Bulkeley announces, with exultation, the division in the Commons,\r\nand returns to his enumeration of _rats_.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD BULKELEY TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Stanhope Street, Dec. 29th, 1788.\r\n     MY DEAREST LORD,\r\n\r\n     We are in high spirits here at the first majority of 64, and at the\r\n     last of 73, which, considering the open and undisguised canvass of\r\n     the Prince and the Duke of York, and the very liberal distribution\r\n     of promises from both, does the House of Commons a great deal of\r\n     honour. Parry fell down in a fit about two hours before the\r\n     division of the first day, and was carried home in a chair\r\n     speechless, where he remained confined till Monday, when I polled\r\n     him by means of a pair with Sir Robert Clayton, which T. Steele\r\n     arranged for him. A _certain lady_ in St. James's Square has been\r\n     tampering with Parry, and he certainly vented all his grievances\r\n     into the compassionate bosom of that active and politic fair one,\r\n     who has likewise infused such a political ardour into the mind of\r\n     her dear Sir Poddy, that on the first division he was seen to take\r\n     down the names of the different speeches and the members, besides\r\n     _other occasional notes_. I have not been in St. James's Square\r\n     since I have been in town, the manner with which they affect to\r\n     treat me being such that _an old English Baron_ cannot put up with;\r\n     besides _we are_ not in the best of humours at present, Sir Poddy\r\n     being unwell, and unable to attend the last division and _we find_\r\n     it difficult to sing the praises of the Prince and the Duke of York\r\n     on the usual themes of filial piety, virtue, &c., in the face of a\r\n     majority of 73 in favour of a falling Minister.\r\n\r\n     Sir George Warren was one of the rats, which Lady B. was much\r\n     affected at. He and Lady W. dined with us the day before the first\r\n     division, and both sung the praises of Mr. Pitt, and expressed the\r\n     warmest anxiety for the King's recovery. I was not all surprised,\r\n     well knowing his rattish dispositions. Glynne Wynne, whom I have\r\n     been working for three years to detach Lord Uxbridge from, has,\r\n     with the utmost effrontery, cast his benefactor off, and set him at\r\n     defiance, to which he has been led by promises at Carlton House. I\r\n     trust we shall be able to do his business on a dissolution, and he\r\n     well deserves it, being one of the first of scoundrels.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     I subjoin a list of those members who usually have voted with Mr.\r\n     Pitt, who have quitted him in the late divisions, _i.e._ _rats_.\r\n\r\n     Yours sincerely,\r\n     B.\r\n\r\n     Sir Peter Parker.\r\n     Sir George Warren.\r\n     Sir J.

On the 23rd of December, a resolution, vigorously opposed by\r\nLord North as instituting a fiction in lieu of the royal authority, was\r\nadopted, empowering the Chancellor to affix the Great Seal to such Bill\r\nof Limitations as might be necessary to restrict the power of the future\r\nRegent; but Ministers had no sooner succeeded in carrying their object\r\nto this important stage, than a new impediment presented itself. On the\r\n2nd of January, 1789, Mr. Cornwall, Speaker of the House of Commons,\r\ndied. It was immediately decided that Mr. Grenville should be proposed\r\nto succeed him. On all accounts, it was indispensable to hasten this\r\narrangement, as the functions of the Commons were unavoidably suspended\r\nin the interim. A serious obstacle arose from the informality of the\r\nproceeding, the sanction of the royal approbation being necessary,\r\naccording to custom, upon the nomination of a new Speaker. The elastic\r\ncharacter of the Constitution, however, although not providing direct\r\nremedies for such special cases, admits of adaptation to the most\r\nunforeseen exigencies; and so urgent was the pressure of affairs at this\r\nagitating juncture, that the irregularity was passed over by the tacit\r\nconsent of all parties.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Whitehall, Jan. 2nd, 1788.[B]\r\n     MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     You will probably not be a little surprised at the contents of this\r\n     letter. The Speaker died this morning at about nine o'clock, and\r\n     after some consideration, it has been determined that I should be\r\n     proposed to the House to succeed him. I am not quite sure whether\r\n     the choice will come on to-morrow or Monday. The situation is a new\r\n     one, it having always been held, that the King's commands are\r\n     necessary for the election of a Speaker, and his approbation for\r\n     confirming him in his situation. But this cannot be had under the\r\n     present circumstances; nor can the House take any steps to supply\r\n     the deficiency till they have a Speaker. At the Restoration and\r\n     Revolution, the House, in both instances, chose a Speaker, who was\r\n     acknowledged as such, and was never afterwards confirmed by the\r\n     King.\r\n\r\n     With respect to myself, the time for deliberation has not been\r\n     long. But upon the whole, I think the decision which I have made is\r\n     clearly right. If the King recovers before Parliament is dissolved,\r\n     it is clearly understood that my acceptance of this situation is\r\n     not to prejudice my other views; and in the public opinion, the\r\n     having filled this office, though but for a short time, will rather\r\n     forward them. If the Regent goes on without dissolving, I am then\r\n     in a situation which, though perhaps not perfectly pleasant, is\r\n     nevertheless respectable, and will give me occupation. If they\r\n     dissolve, and carry the Chair against me in the new Parliament, I\r\n     do not see how I stand worse, in any respect, for having held this\r\n     office. Such is my reasoning, and I think you will approve it. As\r\n     far as I can judge, there is no doubt of my carrying it _now_. I\r\n     have not yet heard whether they start any opponent, but I think\r\n     they have none whose personal connexions can materially vary the\r\n     proportion between the two parties: it is very sufficiently\r\n     decisive.\r\n\r\n     I have not heard the account of to-day at St. James's. Nothing can\r\n     be better than all the accounts, both public and private, for the\r\n     last three or four days. It is certainly not sanguine to entertain\r\n     the very best hopes; and the progress has even been more rapid than\r\n     Willis expected; so that I think we may look with some confidence\r\n     to March or April at latest.\r\n\r\n     Ever most affectionately yours,\r\n     W. W. G.\r\n\r\n[Footnote B: This is the date in the original, but it is evidently a\r\nmistake. Mr. Grenville forgot that he was in a new year.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Whitehall, Jan. 4th, 1789.\r\n     MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     The plan for the Regency was sent to the Prince of Wales in a\r\n     letter from Pitt, three days ago, with an expression of his\r\n     readiness to give any explanation, either in person or in any\r\n     other manner that he might intimate. Yesterday his answer was\r\n     received, directed _to the Cabinet_. It is long, and with much\r\n     affectation of good writing, and is in parts of it well expressed,\r\n     in other parts confused and timid. It ends, however, with saying\r\n     that if these restrictions are adopted by Parliament he will\r\n     _accept_.\r\n\r\n     I have no doubt of carrying the Chair to-morrow, but not a little\r\n     doubt whether I ought to have accepted it. The die is, however, now\r\n     cast. The restrictions will, I think, pass without much difficulty.\r\n\r\n     I still adhere strongly to my opinion about the prorogation,\r\n     because I think there is a wide difference between exercising\r\n     during the King's health a power which he commits to your\r\n     discretion, but which he might if he pleased regulate by\r\n     instruction at any moment, and exercising the same power now when\r\n     you are to state that the King is prevented by infirmity from\r\n     attending at all to the administration of his Government. I am sure\r\n     that your acting in the manner you speak of is liable to, and will\r\n     probably bear, the very worst construction in the minds of the\r\n     public here; and I cannot for the life of me conceive what fear\r\n     there can be that the two Houses will not adjourn, considering that\r\n     the great point which they all wish, is that they may not be\r\n     obliged to pledge themselves. The extraordinary anxiety in those\r\n     whom you see, to get you to prorogue, is, in my opinion, a very\r\n     strong proof of their being actuated by that sort of wish.\r\n\r\n     I have not time to write any more, except to express my anxiety to\r\n     hear how Lady B. and your child go on.\r\n\r\n     Ever most affectionately yours,\r\n     W. W. G.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was no doubt about the issue of the election to the Speakership.\r\n\"Your brother William will certainly be Speaker,\" writes Lord Bulkeley\r\non the 3rd, \"and has already stood the hoax at White's, where it was\r\ndebated last night whether he should wear a wig or his own hair.\" The\r\nelection went off to the entire satisfaction of Mr. Grenville, who,\r\nreporting the event, says that \"the majority, though quite large enough,\r\nwould have been larger if they had divided half an hour later, as nearly\r\nforty of my friends were locked out below, and about eleven of theirs.\"\r\nWith his customary philosophy, he made the best of everything; but he\r\ndoes not disguise from Lord Buckingham that he had strong doubts in his\r\nmind whether he ought to have accepted the Chair. The Opposition might,\r\nprobably, have been stronger against his election, but for the belief\r\nthat prevailed that the King was getting rapidly better. \"The progress\r\nof the King,\" observes Mr. Grenville on the 7th, \"is such, _according to\r\nour accounts_, that it is by no means impossible, nor even a very\r\nimprobable case, that before the Irish Bill can pass, he may re-assume\r\nhis Government.\"\r\n\r\nAnother contingency that weighed with the floating mass of undecided\r\npoliticians was the rumour which now began to be circulated that the\r\nRegent would not dismiss the existing Ministers till the end of the\r\nsession.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD MORNINGTON TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Jan. 6th, 1789.\r\n     MY DEAR LORD,\r\n\r\n     As I understood that Sir W. Young and Bernard wrote you an account\r\n     of the division last night, which placed Grenville so honourably in\r\n     the Chair of the House of Commons, I did not trouble you with any\r\n     letter by the post of yesterday; but I cannot deny myself the\r\n     pleasure of acquainting you, that nothing could be more perfectly\r\n     satisfactory to all our friends than the conduct of the new Speaker\r\n     on an occasion naturally distressing; his speech of excuse, and his\r\n     speech from the steps of the Chair, were universally admired, they\r\n     were both so composed and delivered as to render a scene, which I\r\n     have always understood to be very ridiculous, really interesting\r\n     and affecting. It is deemed a misfortune amongst our friends, that\r\n     the practice of printing the Speaker's speeches on this occasion in\r\n     the journals is now disused. Grenville's speeches would have done\r\n     him the highest credit, as well as afforded an excellent precedent\r\n     to future Speakers. I have prevailed with Mr. Speaker to mount his\r\n     wig, and the whole apparatus to-day: he must consider this as a\r\n     young lawyer does his first appearance at the bar, and the sooner\r\n     the laugh is over the better for the dignity of the Chair. Whatever\r\n     may be Grenville's future fortunes, it can be no discredit to his\r\n     character to have been placed in the Chair by such a majority, in\r\n     such times and circumstances, and at his age.\r\n\r\n     I write no accounts of what we are doing, you hear that much more\r\n     correctly from Grenville. I am anxious to know what will be the\r\n     temper of Ireland at the meeting. Grattan is as much a creature of\r\n     Fox and his party, as the meanest libeller in the \"Morning Herald;\"\r\n     he lives entirely with them. I hear Pelham is to take his father on\r\n     his back to the Government of Ireland. Grattan will stand, in my\r\n     opinion, on most unpopular ground, if he either attempts to assert\r\n     the hereditary right of the Prince, or to give him larger powers in\r\n     Ireland, than the Parliament of this country entrust to him for the\r\n     administration of the British Government. The hereditary right, I\r\n     suppose Grattan will not venture to touch; and the latter\r\n     proposition, I think, might be argued exactly as he argued the\r\n     Perpetual Mutiny Bill, and other questions, where the danger of\r\n     larger powers in Ireland than were held in England by the same\r\n     hands, were considered with a view to the Constitutions of _both_\r\n     countries. This argument is, in my opinion, clear, if the rights of\r\n     the King on the throne are admitted to be the rights of the people\r\n     at large, and if they are not, I know not why they exist. I have\r\n     not much fear that the Irish Parliament will listen to such\r\n     proposals. As to reversions and offices for life, a Regent, who has\r\n     not the power of granting them here, and attempts to obtain it in\r\n     Ireland, can mean nothing else than to indemnify his disappointed\r\n     friends in England at the expense of Ireland; I do not think this\r\n     can go down. On the whole, I think your argument in Ireland\r\n     stronger in every view than ours here, and that is saying a great\r\n     deal.\r\n\r\n     Arthur informs me that my Trimmers wish to have a company of foot\r\n     quartered on them. I am sure I have no objection to your giving\r\n     _free quarters_ to the whole army on the worthy inhabitants of that\r\n     ancient and loyal town.\r\n\r\n     I sincerely wish you joy of your son, and hope the bad weather does\r\n     not affect either him or Lady Buckingham.\r\n\r\n     Ever, my dear Lord,\r\n     Yours most affectionately,\r\n     MORNINGTON.\r\n\r\n     What think of Sir John Aubrey, rat?\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Whitehall, Jan. 10th, 1789.\r\n     MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     I send you a letter of Camplin's, about an exchange which had been\r\n     proposed. We have no news here--everything remaining in precisely\r\n     the same state. The Committee, will, I think, most probably not\r\n     make their report to-day, though we meet for the chance of it. In\r\n     this manner, it will be impossible that the restrictions can be\r\n     opened before Tuesday or Wednesday. The debates of the Committee\r\n     have been conducted with great heat and violence on both sides, and\r\n     much indecency towards the King, particularly from Fox and Burke.\r\n     They are now endeavouring to turn it into a personal attack upon\r\n     the Queen, for having wished to make one of the reports of the\r\n     physicians more favourable, and for having dismissed Baker from her\r\n     service, on the ground of the great inattention towards the King\r\n     and his family, which appears on the face of his former\r\n     examination: he having perceived symptoms of this disorder so early\r\n     as the 22nd of October, and having, subsequent to that time,\r\n     entirely left the King.\r\n\r\n     The examination of Baker and Warren state the probability of\r\n     recovery as being nearly the same as when they were before\r\n     examined, but rather less. Willis and Pepys state it as much\r\n     greater; particularly the former of these two, who speaks in the\r\n     most sanguine terms. The answers of Reynolds and Gisborne are also,\r\n     as I believe, favourable.\r\n\r\n     These delays put all idea of dissolution out of the question, till\r\n     the end of the present session, at soonest; and that cannot take\r\n     place, according to my calculation, till the end of June. People\r\n     begin to speak doubtfully about the Regent's making any immediate\r\n     change, and I know that some of their friends affect to hold that\r\n     language; but I am inclined to think that, however difficult it may\r\n     be for them to undertake the Government under the existing\r\n     circumstances, it is absolutely impossible for them to satisfy the\r\n     Regent, or to quiet their own dependants, without running that\r\n     risk.\r\n\r\n     Fox is apparently recovering, but slowly.\r\n\r\n     Ever most affectionately yours,\r\n     W. W. G.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Whitehall, Jan. 12th, 1789.\r\n     MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     I understand from different conversations, as well as from the\r\n     general report here, that there is an intention of moving for an\r\n     Address to the Prince, such as was proposed here, immediately on\r\n     the first meeting of the Irish Parliament. Grattan, &c., &c., are\r\n     all going over, so as to be in Dublin by the 20th. He is understood\r\n     to have entered completely into all the views of the party here,\r\n     and to be ready to pledge himself to all their doctrines,\r\n     maintained, or retracted, or both. I thought it right to give you\r\n     this intelligence, although you will probably hear it from many\r\n     other quarters, and though I have very little apprehension, indeed,\r\n     from the effect of such a manoeuvre. If anything could more\r\n     completely ruin them here than they are ruined already, it would be\r\n     such a measure. As to its effect in Ireland, I cannot persuade\r\n     myself that there can be any difficulty in getting people to pledge\r\n     themselves not to run before this country; and to appoint a Regent,\r\n     without conditions, in Ireland, before it is even known what\r\n     conditions are to be proposed, much less whether they will be\r\n     adopted by the British Parliament. At all events, however, the\r\n     battle must be fought; for it would be the most disgraceful thing\r\n     in the world to appear to give it up, or rather not to appear to\r\n     dispute it inch by inch.\r\n\r\n     Lord Glendon and Lord Fairford are both going over to assist you.\r\n     They both complain (particularly the former) of want of attention\r\n     from you; but I am so accustomed to such complaints, without\r\n     foundation, that I am not disposed to give much credit to them in\r\n     this instance. I understand that Lord Hillsborough has expressed\r\n     himself on the subject in a more decided manner than you seem at\r\n     all disposed to give him credit for.\r\n\r\n     Our report cannot probably be made to-day; but when it does appear,\r\n     I am told that the impression of it will be favourable to the idea\r\n     of the King's recovery. Surely, when this circumstance is taken\r\n     into consideration by your Irish speculators, in addition to the\r\n     many other considerations which make everybody here allow that\r\n     Pitt's side has the best of the day, they will not be induced to\r\n     hazard so decisive a step as you must give them to understand their\r\n     agreeing to this Address will be considered.\r\n\r\n     It was mentioned to me, that considerable offers had been made to\r\n     Corry. I mention this to you, but you will probably be able to\r\n     ascertain the truth of the report more accurately than I can.\r\n\r\n     It is worth observing, that the appointment of a Regent in Ireland\r\n     by Address goes directly to dissolve the Union of the two kingdoms,\r\n     because a Regent so appointed could not command the use of the\r\n     English Great Seal.\r\n\r\n     Ever most affectionately yours,\r\n     W. W. G.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Whitehall, Jan. 19th, 1789.\r\n     MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     I was so knocked up on Saturday, that I found it impossible to\r\n     write to you; though there is one circumstance, which, if I had\r\n     been acquainted with, would have prevailed over all fatigue--I mean\r\n     that of Captain Nugent's having voted against us upon the second\r\n     division. The question has not been distinctly stated in any of the\r\n     papers, as far as I have seen. It was a proposal of Fox's, that\r\n     the restrictions, particularly that of peerage, should continue\r\n     only for a limited time; by which means, we should have been placed\r\n     in this sort of situation, that if, at the expiration of that term,\r\n     the King should be so far recovered, as to afford hopes even of an\r\n     almost immediate recovery, the Regent would be able, by a sudden\r\n     creation of Peers, to make it impossible for him to resume his\r\n     authority.\r\n\r\n     Nugent had voted with us upon the first question; but was, I\r\n     suppose, led away by some part of Fox's speech, which had the\r\n     effect of carrying over Bankes and about six or seven more of our\r\n     _conscientious_ friends. I think it right to mention this\r\n     circumstance to you, though not with any view of suggesting what\r\n     you may think it right to do. I shall, I own, be much mortified if\r\n     he should vote against us on Monday; but nothing that you can do\r\n     will be in time enough to prevent that. I do not feel that I can\r\n     take any measures on the subject, although I certainly have no\r\n     doubt what your wishes would have been if you were on the spot.\r\n\r\n     I find, from general report, that some of our friends are staggered\r\n     about the household resolution, which is to be proposed on Monday.\r\n     It is, therefore, probable, that we shall not carry this by so\r\n     triumphant a majority as we have the other questions. I think,\r\n     however, there is little doubt that we shall carry it; and that is\r\n     the point of real importance.\r\n\r\n     I shall be anxious to hear the event of your meeting. You will have\r\n     observed that, by Lord Sydney's despatch, a latitude is given you\r\n     of proroguing, in stating the opinion of the King's servants on the\r\n     different points. I thought, when the despatch was shown to me,\r\n     that this was a favourable circumstance, as, from your letters, it\r\n     seemed to me at that time very doubtful whether you would not have\r\n     adopted that measure; and, in that case, I felt that you would\r\n     certainly have been glad to have this sort of sanction.\r\n\r\n     Believe me ever most affectionately yours,\r\n     W. W. G.\r\n\r\n     The Duke of Leinster has, as I suppose you know, written to the\r\n     Prince of Wales, to offer himself to him. The consequence has been,\r\n     that Lord Charles Fitzgerald has declared, that he does not\r\n     consider himself in a situation to be turned over from party to\r\n     party every half-year; and that he has hoisted an Orange cape. He\r\n     will, as I understand, not go over to Ireland at the meeting; and I\r\n     take it for granted, that in case of a dissolution the Duke will\r\n     not re-elect him.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Whitehall, Jan. 19th, 1789.\r\n     MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     Since I wrote my other letter of this date, I have received yours\r\n     of the 15th, stating your alarm at the lies spread in Ireland about\r\n     the proceedings of the Committee of the House of Commons. You will,\r\n     long before this, have received the report itself from me, and by\r\n     reading it, will have found how much more favourable the account of\r\n     the King's situation appears from that examination, and how much\r\n     you are in the wrong to suffer your noble spirit to be cast down by\r\n     such weak inventions of the enemy; and above all, how monstrous the\r\n     idea is that Fox is to gain with the public by a transaction which\r\n     only shows their inveterate malice against the King and Queen, and\r\n     its utter impotence. Your expressions of duper and duped, you will\r\n     see are equally inapplicable to our representations of the King's\r\n     situation, which I think you will still believe to be as authentic\r\n     and as credible as the lies which Grattan and Forbes retail from\r\n     the porter's lodge at Carlton or Burlington House. Seriously\r\n     speaking, I am vexed to see the importance which you attach to all\r\n     these reports, because I know that it must work and agitate your\r\n     mind. A whole life would not suffice, on my part, to answer every\r\n     lie in circulation: but I beg you to believe that although,\r\n     perhaps, naturally a little sanguine in my temper, yet that if\r\n     there was any really unfavourable circumstance which arose here, I\r\n     would not conceal it from you. The King is better ever since that\r\n     examination; and this I speak on no partial authority, but on the\r\n     information of Warren himself, who gave yesterday to the person who\r\n     repeated it to me a much more favourable account.\r\n\r\n     I have not time to answer the rest of your letter to-day. Our Bill\r\n     is not prepared yet, nor can be till the resolutions have been\r\n     agreed to by both Houses; but it will be short, and nearly in the\r\n     same words with the resolutions, adding only the oath of office\r\n     from the Regency Bill of 1765, and a few other particulars.\r\n\r\n     Ever yours,\r\n     W. W. G.\r\n\r\n     I suppose you know that Lord Spencer certainly goes to Ireland.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe notion that the Regent would continue Mr. Pitt and his friends in\r\noffice was rapidly dissipated during the progress of these discussions.\r\nThe Household Bill, alluded to in one of Mr. Grenville's letters, gave\r\ndeep offence to His Royal Highness; and from the moment that part of the\r\nplan was disclosed, there was no longer any disguise about the fact that\r\nthe Prince had not only made up his mind to dismiss the Ministers, but\r\nthat the list of the incoming Administration was actually settled, and\r\nready for use. The object of the Household Bill was to confide to the\r\nQueen the care of the King's person, and the disposition of the royal\r\nhousehold, which would have the effect of placing at Her Majesty's\r\ncontrol the patronage of four hundred places; while the Regent was to\r\npossess no power whatever over any office, reversion, or pension. This\r\nappeared to the Prince and his allies a monstrous proposition,\r\ncalculated to introduce \"weakness, disorder, and insincerity into every\r\nbranch of political business;\" to \"separate the Court from the State;\"\r\nto \"disconnect the authority to command service from the power of\r\nanimating it by reward;\" and to impose on the Regent \"all the invidious\r\nduties of the kingly station, without the means of softening them to the\r\npublic by any one act of grace, favour, or benignity.\"\r\n\r\nIn these poised and melodious sentences (said to have been written by\r\nBurke) may be recognized the policy of the master spirit that raised the\r\nstorm which was to overwhelm Ministers. When the moment came, however,\r\nat which it should have burst--Pitt's motion for the Address--Fox was\r\nabsent. \"Fox is gone to Bath,\" says Mr. Grenville. \"Whether he is very\r\nill, as some say, or wants to shirk the discussion about Mrs.\r\nFitzherbert, as others assert, I know not.\"\r\n\r\nThis business of Mrs. Fitzherbert, of which we hear something in these\r\nletters, was suspended like a sword over the heads of the royal\r\nOpposition; and whenever it threatened to descend, they endeavoured to\r\nescape from it by avoiding the discussion, or to avert it by abating\r\ntheir violence. The rumour, however, which ascribed Fox's absence on\r\nthis occasion to that cause was certainly unfounded. On the 19th of\r\nJanuary, he made his motion for limiting the continuance of the\r\nrestrictions; and on the 26th he was ill at Bath, where he remained for\r\nsome weeks in a precarious state of health. His loss was severely felt\r\nby his party. Ministers were triumphant in both Houses. The incidental\r\nshocks they experienced from the vibrations of that class of persons\r\ndesignated by Mr. Grenville as \"_conscientious_ friends,\" and from the\r\ndefection of the _rats_, had been completely recovered in the final\r\nmajorities of Lords and Commons; and although Fox may not have thought\r\nit prudent on some occasions to enhance the inevitable defeat of the\r\nPrince's followers by assisting at their discomfiture, it is unlikely\r\nthat even the dread of a debate on Mrs. Fitzherbert would have kept him\r\naway at this critical juncture.\r\n\r\nWhile these discussions were going on, always ending in fluctuating\r\nmajorities for Pitt, the Prince of Wales and his brother,\r\nnotwithstanding the dissipation in which they indulged, were\r\nindefatigable in their efforts to cultivate popularity. Thus writes Lord\r\nBulkeley:\r\n\r\n     The Princes go on in their usual style, both keeping open houses,\r\n     and employing every means in their power to gain proselytes,\r\n     attending the Beefsteak Clubs, Freemason meetings, &c., and will\r\n     probably very soon attend the parochial meetings of Lord John\r\n     Townshend's Committee in Westminster. Notwithstanding all this, the\r\n     Parliament still continues steadily to Mr. Pitt, which, considering\r\n     the looseness of morals and of the times, does the members great\r\n     credit. * * * The Duke of York never misses a night at Brookes's,\r\n     where the hawks pluck his feathers unmercifully, and have reduced\r\n     him to the vowels I. O. U. The Prince likewise attends very often,\r\n     and has taken kindly to play.\r\n\r\nGeneral Cuninghame appears to have disappointed the expectations of his\r\nfriends at this period, and, although present in the House on the 19th,\r\ndid not vote. It was the next thing to ratting, and seems to have been\r\nregarded in that light by Lord Bulkeley.\r\n\r\n     General Cuninghame has been blowing hot and cold in his language\r\n     here, but has not voted, not even last night, when he appeared for\r\n     the first time in the House. I have had a letter from the Duke of\r\n     Dorset, complaining of his conduct in not resigning his seat, _as\r\n     his conscience troubled him_.\r\n\r\nNo man had so keen a scent for _rats_ as Lord Bulkeley, and he was\r\ngenerally in advance of his party in detecting them.\r\n\r\nThurlow and Loughborough were both ill at this time (\"which,\" says Sir\r\nWilliam Young, with a touch of sarcastic humour, \"will much shorten the\r\nprogress of the Regency Bill in the Lords\"); and on the 2nd of February,\r\nwhen Mr. Grenville, in his capacity of Speaker, attended at the bar of\r\nthe House of Peers to hear the Commission under the Great Seal read,\r\nThurlow was unable to attend, and Lord Bathurst officiated for him. The\r\nnight before, Thurlow declared, as reported by his physician, that \"if\r\nhe were ten times worse, he'd go, by G--;\" his physician, however,\r\noverruled him; and the obstruction of his presence being thus\r\nfortunately removed, it was anticipated that the progress of the Bill\r\nthrough the Lords would be so rapid as to place the Regent on the throne\r\nin a fortnight. Active preparations were, consequently, set on foot for\r\nsettling the new Administration. Amongst the other great situations,\r\nIreland was offered to the Duke of Northumberland, who declined it, and\r\nthen to Lord Spencer, who accepted it, with Pelham for his secretary.\r\n\r\nIreland was a considerable item in the calculations of the Opposition.\r\n\"The Prince and the Opposition,\" writes Lord Bulkeley, \"have great hopes\r\nof a riot in their favour in the Parliament of Ireland.\" Some such\r\nresult was to be apprehended from the temper of the people, and the\r\nadverse views they took of the Regency question; although a true sense\r\nof their own independence ought to have shown them that there were\r\nnational objections against allowing the Prince to indemnify himself by\r\nthe use of the royal prerogatives in Ireland for the restraints which\r\nwere put upon him in England. The object to which, under these difficult\r\ncircumstances, Lord Buckingham and Mr. Grenville directed their\r\nattention, was to assimilate, as nearly as possible, the Regency Bills\r\nin both countries, so as to prevent the occurrence of so great an\r\nanomaly as that of having a Regent whose powers should be strictly\r\nlimited in the one kingdom, and who should, at the same time, be\r\ninvested with unrestricted powers in the other. The Parliament of\r\nIreland possessed the unquestionable right of deciding the Regency in\r\ntheir own way, leaving the legal validity of the act for subsequent\r\nconsideration; and as it was understood that the Opposition intended to\r\nmove an Address to the Prince, which there was reason to believe they\r\nwould be able to carry, calling upon His Royal Highness to assume the\r\nGovernment of Ireland unconditionally during the term of His Majesty's\r\nillness, the position of Lord Buckingham had become peculiarly\r\nembarrassing. What course should be taken in the event of such an\r\nAddress being carried? This question is anxiously discussed in numerous\r\ncommunications between Lord Buckingham and Mr. Grenville and other\r\nmembers of the Government. The predicament was so strange, and involved\r\nconstitutional considerations of such importance, as to give the most\r\nserious disquietude to the Administration. The first expedient thought\r\nof was to delay the proceedings of the Irish Parliament, by adjournment,\r\nor any other available means, till after the Regent had been appointed\r\nin England, provided the motion for the Address could be successfully\r\nresisted in the first instance. But as it was almost certain the\r\nAdministration would be beaten on that motion, it remained to be\r\ndetermined whether Lord Buckingham, in that event, should refuse to\r\ntransmit the Address to His Royal Highness. Upon the propriety of so\r\nextreme a measure Mr. Grenville entertained some doubts in the\r\nbeginning. By refusing to transmit the Address, the Lord-Lieutenant\r\nwould clearly put himself in the way as an obstacle to that mode of\r\nproviding for the emergency which the two Houses of Parliament were\r\ndetermined to adopt; or, on the other hand, by sending it he would make\r\nhimself, in some degree, a party to a request by which His Royal\r\nHighness was asked to do an act which he, Lord Buckingham, held His\r\nRoyal Highness to be precluded by law from doing. Such was the dilemma\r\nas it presented itself to the mind of Mr. Grenville. One escape from it\r\nwas, to forward the Address, accompanied by a representation from Lord\r\nBuckingham of his own views of its illegality. Another was, to resign.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, the projects of the Opposition in England were checked\r\nby the gratifying accounts from Kew. The King was visibly improving, and\r\nhopes began to be entertained that there might be no necessity for a\r\nRegency after all. The letters of Mr. Grenville, reverting to the\r\nopening of the Parliament, trace the progress of these circumstances in\r\ndetail.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Whitehall, Feb. 2nd, 1789.\r\n     MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     Our Parliament has this day been opened by Lord Bathurst, the\r\n     Chancellor being so ill as to make it absolutely impossible for him\r\n     to come down. The Commission was first read, and then Lord Bathurst\r\n     said, in a few words, that the Lords Commissioners being empowered\r\n     by the said Commission to declare the causes of calling the\r\n     Parliament, thought it their duty to call the attention of the two\r\n     Houses to the melancholy circumstance of His Majesty's illness, and\r\n     to recommend to them to provide for the care of His Majesty's royal\r\n     person, and the administration of the royal authority during His\r\n     Majesty's illness, in such manner as the exigency of the case\r\n     requires.\r\n\r\n     I think that my former calculation is rather too sanguine, and that\r\n     the 18th is the soonest that the Bill can pass, allowing for the\r\n     debate, of which notice has been given in both Houses, on the\r\n     Committee for the royal assent. The idea is, that the letters of\r\n     dismission are ready written, and will be sent that day.\r\n\r\n     I cannot yet learn, with certainty, who is to be the Home Secretary\r\n     of State. It is supposed to lie between Lord Stormont and Lord\r\n     Rawdon; and there is a report that they are quarrelling about that\r\n     as about everything else, and that the Duke of York espouses Lord\r\n     Rawdon's cause very warmly.\r\n\r\n     The accounts of Fox are that he is not at all better, and that he\r\n     has not been able yet to drink the waters. His death would throw\r\n     them into complete confusion, though the Prince is so far pledged,\r\n     that even in that case he must attempt to form a new Government.\r\n\r\n     We mean (but this _inter nos_ only) to move an Amendment upon the\r\n     Address, expressive of our satisfaction at the flourishing state in\r\n     which the public affairs are delivered into His Royal Highness's\r\n     hands, and of our hope that the same principles and measures will\r\n     continue to be pursued. I have no doubt of our carrying this, in\r\n     their teeth.\r\n\r\n     Everybody seems to think a dissolution certain. I imagine it cannot\r\n     by possibility take place till May or June, though some people\r\n     expect it in March.\r\n\r\n     I believe I mentioned to you in my last the great improvement which\r\n     these last few days have made in the King's situation, and the\r\n     strong hope which we derive from it.\r\n\r\n     Ever most affectionately yours,\r\n     W. W. G.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Whitehall, Feb. 7th, 1789.\r\n     MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     I do not know of anything that has happened here since I wrote\r\n     last, which is worth mentioning to you. Our Bill is to be in the\r\n     Committee to-day, and Monday, so that I guess we shall not get it\r\n     into the House of Lords till Wednesday or Thursday. This will put\r\n     off the passing a little beyond my calculation, and I imagine the\r\n     Regent will not now be in full possession of his office till about\r\n     the 19th or 20th. I wait with much impatience to hear what has\r\n     passed on Thursday in the Irish Parliament. I find that people\r\n     here, those at least with whom I converse, are indifferent about\r\n     the success of the measure in Ireland, but are much exasperated at\r\n     the madness and folly of the people who are endeavouring to stir\r\n     fresh questions of separation between the two countries.\r\n\r\n     The accounts of the King still continue to be very favourable, but\r\n     I have not heard what degree of hope Willis grounds on this long\r\n     period of tranquillity. I should think that the breaking out in the\r\n     neck must be a favourable circumstance, but I begin to think the\r\n     time long if he still continues without real amendment of the\r\n     complaint itself. This, however, arises more from one's natural\r\n     impatience than from any reasonable ground which there is to think\r\n     worse of the case from this circumstance.\r\n\r\n     One hears of nothing now but of the intended arrangements. Among\r\n     these, the military is not the least curious part. His Royal\r\n     Highness the Duke of York is to be Commander-in-chief; Fitzpatrick,\r\n     Secretary at War; and there are to be four Field-Marshals;\r\n     consisting of the Regent himself, of the Dukes of York and\r\n     Gloucester, and General Conway. These Field-Marshals--of whom three\r\n     never saw a shot fired, and the fourth of whom has not served for\r\n     six-and-twenty years, except in the very peaceful situation of\r\n     Commander-in-chief in England for a few months at the end of the\r\n     war--make a pretty curious promotion. Faucitt is to continue,\r\n     notwithstanding a positive promise of the Duke of Portland's to\r\n     General Vaughan, for the sake of securing his vote and his\r\n     brother's. They are to make all the Colonels Major-Generals, down\r\n     to Lord Rawdon. The list of the Prince's aides-de-camp you will\r\n     have seen in the papers.\r\n\r\n     Lord Spencer is declared for Ireland.\r\n\r\n     The accounts from Bath say that Fox is better, and will recover.\r\n\r\n     The town and neighbourhood of Buckingham have voted an unanimous\r\n     Address to Pitt, without any of us knowing a word about it. It is\r\n     signed by near two hundred persons, as Jemmy tells me, for I have\r\n     not seen it.\r\n\r\n     I am living in hourly fear of having a meeting called in the\r\n     county, which would be a troublesome and useless thing, though, I\r\n     understand, the sense of the yeomanry is entirely with us. I hear\r\n     nothing of their intentions in case of a dissolution, but much\r\n     doubt, from what I hear, whether they will think of doing more than\r\n     ousting Aubrey, which they may do very peaceably; for by what I\r\n     hear, he would not have ten votes.\r\n\r\n     I have, at length, decided not to think of the Bolton Street house,\r\n     at least for the present year, as the repairs necessary to make it\r\n     habitable amount to so large a sum. Perhaps, if I was to be\r\n     re-elected after a dissolution it might be worth my while; but that\r\n     is, as you will easily suppose, a very doubtful contingency. Is it\r\n     not a singular thing that it should be doubtful at all, and that\r\n     there should be any chance of beating them in the new Parliament on\r\n     such a question as that?\r\n\r\n     Ever most affectionately yours,\r\n     W. W. G.\r\n\r\n     I open this letter again, to let you know that I have just received\r\n     an account of Sir Thomas Halifax's death, which happened this\r\n     morning. This circumstance is not a little perplexing to me,\r\n     especially in Bernard's absence. I have sent an express to Chaplin\r\n     to desire him to come to town to-morrow, and I shall then hear what\r\n     he says. The thing to be wished is, that we could secure Bernard's\r\n     election, now and hereafter, without much increase of expense; but\r\n     on that whole subject I am very much at sea, and there cannot be\r\n     time to hear from you and him upon it. Perhaps Chaplin may think it\r\n     better that we should now propose some other person, who might be\r\n     supported by Lord Chesterfield's interest, and not appear so\r\n     decidedly connected with us as Bernard is. We had a scheme for a\r\n     candidate of that sort at the general election, and Lord C. was\r\n     inclined to give into it. At all events, I think it is absolutely\r\n     necessary that Bernard should come over instantly, as his presence\r\n     is equally necessary, either as a candidate or in order to get a\r\n     repetition of the promises which this intervening election might\r\n     otherwise be construed to annul.\r\n\r\n     I have heard, since I wrote the preceding part of this letter, that\r\n     the Chancellor has been at Pitt's to-day, with an account that he\r\n     had seen Warren this morning, who had spoken to him in a very\r\n     favourable manner of the King's present state, and had even said\r\n     that he thought the amendment so material, that he had felt it his\r\n     duty, immediately on coming to town, to wait upon His Royal\r\n     Highness with the account. So there is a little bane for your rats.\r\n\r\n     Ever yours,\r\n     W. W. G.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Whitehall, Feb. 14th, 1739.\r\n     MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     Although I have nothing else to write to you, yet I could not\r\n     refuse myself the pleasure of letting you know that I have been at\r\n     Kew to-day with Pitt, and that the account which he received from\r\n     Willis is such as to confirm and strengthen all our hopes. The\r\n     public account is, as you will see, that the King continues in a\r\n     state of gradual amendment; and every circumstance which we can\r\n     learn, affords us room to entertain the most sanguine hopes. What\r\n     has already passed in the public, on the subject of Willis, and the\r\n     violent attacks of Opposition against him, have made him more\r\n     cautious and reserved in what he says, and he particularly desires\r\n     that his name may not be quoted. But I could not find in my heart\r\n     to conceal from you the favourable manner in which he speaks of\r\n     the present situation.\r\n\r\n     His account is confirmed by that of the other physicians, who all\r\n     speak the same language. Sir G. Baker told him to-day, that if it\r\n     was the case of a common patient whom he was attending, he should\r\n     not think it necessary to give him any more medicines. The most\r\n     favourable circumstance of all is, the great abatement of the\r\n     pulse, which, till now, has always been much too high.\r\n\r\n     You will easily imagine how much speculation all this makes, and a\r\n     more curious scene, I think, I never saw. The prevailing opinion\r\n     is, that we are not to be turned out. There is a report, which is\r\n     very confidently circulated (but I do not vouch for the truth of\r\n     it), that the Duke of Portland has positively told His Royal\r\n     Highness that, under these circumstances, it is impossible for him\r\n     to take any share in a new arrangement. It is also said that they\r\n     have quarrelled about the Prince's debts, but these are points of\r\n     which I know nothing but from report.\r\n\r\n     The account which Lord Chesterfield had yesterday from his friends\r\n     at Aylesbury tallies with Chaplin's, as to the possibility of\r\n     Bernard's success, though it is not quite so sanguine as to\r\n     numbers. If he succeeds at all, this last point may be no\r\n     misfortune to him, as it will diminish the claims upon him.\r\n\r\n     Ever most affectionately yours,\r\n     W. W. G.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Irish Parliament had met in the interim, and were debating with\r\nextraordinary vigour and asperity the Address by which the Prince of\r\nWales, before he had been appointed Regent in England, was to be invited\r\nto assume at once the functions and privileges of the Crown in Ireland.\r\nMany of the usual supporters of the Government, including even some\r\npersons in high employments, had joined the ranks of the Opposition; and\r\nLord Buckingham in his letters to Lord Sydney declares that his powers\r\nhad been annihilated by that lapse of the sovereign authority which led\r\nto this result, and that it would be no longer proper for him to\r\ninterfere any further, except only in reference to the \"usual business\r\nof the kingdom.\" Acting on the pressure of these circumstances, he felt\r\nit due to his own credit, and to the service in which he was engaged, to\r\ntender his resignation, as appears by the following letter from Mr.\r\nGrenville:\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Whitehall, Feb. 13th, 1789.\r\n     MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     We have no news here, except of the favourable accounts of the\r\n     King's situation, which are every hour more and more confirmed. All\r\n     our present anxiety is, to keep down the too sanguine expectations\r\n     of our friends, in order to prevent their being too much damped by\r\n     any check, which Willis considers as an event by no means unlikely,\r\n     and not such as in any degree to diminish his confidence in the\r\n     King's recovery. From the general turn of people's conversation\r\n     here, it seems by no means certain that the Prince will take any\r\n     step for dismissing the present Government, if the King continues\r\n     to mend. It would, indeed, be a measure so grossly indecent to turn\r\n     out the King's servants at the eve of his recovery, that it would\r\n     be too strong even for those counsels by which His Royal Highness\r\n     has hitherto been actuated. But there is another consideration\r\n     which will possibly have still more weight, namely, that the\r\n     acceptance of office under such circumstances would put his friends\r\n     to considerable inconvenience and expense, such as to be by no\r\n     means worth incurring, if they are to hold them for so very short\r\n     a period as the King's present situation appears to indicate. This\r\n     mode of reasoning is of itself sufficiently obvious, and I\r\n     understand that the Prince has held a language which corresponds\r\n     with it, since so great an alteration has taken place.\r\n\r\n     Under these circumstances, you must see that the letter which you\r\n     sent me is clearly inapplicable to the present situation. If,\r\n     contrary to our present expectation, the Prince should dismiss us\r\n     all immediately, I will lose no time in sending that letter; but if\r\n     not, it seems to be the wish of all your friends that you should\r\n     remain where you are for some little time, in order that you may\r\n     not have the appearance of being driven away either by the event\r\n     which has happened, or by the violence of the abuse thrown out\r\n     against you. I see and acknowledge the difficulties of such a\r\n     situation, and lament that you should in any case be subject to\r\n     them, but you must, on the other hand, consider that these\r\n     difficulties do not of themselves, unaccompanied by other\r\n     circumstances, afford a reason for withdrawing yourself from them.\r\n     I am far from being desirous, for many, very many reasons, that\r\n     your stay should be prolonged to the usual period of a\r\n     Lord-Lieutenant's reign; but I cannot help most earnestly wishing\r\n     that you could, in some mode or other, struggle through the present\r\n     session, in order to cover your retreat, which will otherwise by\r\n     your enemies be represented as a flight.\r\n\r\n     You see that all this refers to an event which may possibly not\r\n     happen; but I felt it indispensably due to you that I should beg\r\n     you to consider this case very seriously, and that with a view not\r\n     to present difficulties only, but taking into the account your\r\n     future situation. I have told you what I believe is the unanimous\r\n     wish of your friends on such lights as we possess here. It is\r\n     possible that circumstances with which we are unacquainted might\r\n     alter our opinion, but they must be very strong before they could\r\n     produce that effect.\r\n\r\n     I know no other point which is worth writing to you about:\r\n     certainly none which is worth your bestowing a moment, thought\r\n     upon, in comparison with that which I have mentioned. I enclose my\r\n     last account from Aylesbury. I need not say how much I feel for the\r\n     unpleasant circumstances of your present situation. But I know that\r\n     you have the best resource against them, in the sense of your own\r\n     conduct, and in the consciousness of the sincere and invariable\r\n     affection of those whose friendship you value.\r\n\r\n     Ever most affectionately yours,\r\n     W. W. G.\r\n\r\nTwo days afterwards, the report of the King's health was so encouraging\r\nthat his recovery was considered by the Cabinet as little less than\r\nabsolutely certain. Under these circumstances, it became a matter of\r\nspeculation whether the Prince would dismiss the Ministers, or, if he\r\ndid not, whether he would treat them in such a manner as to make it\r\nimpossible for them to stay in office. In any case, whether they were\r\ndismissed or driven to resign, Mr. Grenville judged it prudent to\r\nwithhold Lord Buckingham's letter of resignation, till the solution,\r\neither way, should have been ascertained. The conflicting difficulties\r\nof the situation, looking at it from all sides, are ably stated in a\r\nletter of the 15th of February.\r\n\r\n     You cannot come away, without appearing to desert your trust, while\r\n     the King's servants here abide by theirs; nor without giving the\r\n     Regent an opportunity to object to the nomination of any person who\r\n     may be proposed to him by Pitt to succeed you. You cannot remain\r\n     without the means of carrying on some appearance, at least, of\r\n     government in the House of Commons. You cannot employ those who\r\n     have now deserted you; nor can we expect that the Prince will\r\n     allow you to dismiss those whom he considers as having stood by\r\n     him. On the whole, I cannot imagine a more puzzling or distressing\r\n     case.\r\n\r\nNothing short of the implicit confidence and cordial support of the\r\nMinisters, seconded by the highest courage and firmness on his own part,\r\ncould have enabled Lord Buckingham to sustain his authority in this\r\ntrying emergency. That he possessed the confidence and support of\r\nGovernment to the fullest extent, is attested by the following letter\r\nfrom Mr. Pitt; and that he displayed the qualities of resolution and\r\nself-reliance demanded by the occasion, is sufficiently shown in the\r\nsequel.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. PITT TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     (Private.) Downing Street, Feb. 15th, 1789.\r\n     MY DEAR LORD,\r\n\r\n     The account received this morning of the step which the Irish House\r\n     of Commons have taken, has not surprised me; as it seemed before\r\n     evident that the torrent was too strong to be stemmed by any\r\n     exertion. Those who at the moment felt it as a triumph, perhaps\r\n     already begin to repent of it, and will probably have more and more\r\n     reason to do so every day. It will be abundant satisfaction to you\r\n     and your friends that you have done everything which depended on\r\n     you; and in the midst of so much profligacy, that you have\r\n     experienced such a support as that of Fitzgibbon and a few others,\r\n     which is in the highest degree honourable and manly.\r\n\r\n     I am fully aware how delicate your ground has been in all the\r\n     progress of the business, of which we have hitherto learnt the\r\n     result; and that it is not less so in what remained relative to the\r\n     transmission of this strange Address. Whatever you may have\r\n     decided on the spot will, I dare say, under all the circumstances,\r\n     have been right; and in either of the alternatives, you will not\r\n     want here the most cordial and decided support, whenever the\r\n     measure comes into discussion. All that I am now writing is, I\r\n     hope, superfluous; but I could not let the messenger go, without\r\n     expressing in part the sentiments for which I trust you would at\r\n     any rate have given me credit.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     Believe me, my dear Lord,\r\n     Sincerely and affectionately yours,\r\n     W. PITT.\r\n\r\n\r\nLord Buckingham, acting on the discretion thus confided to him, resolved\r\nto decline accepting or transmitting the Address. This determination,\r\nwhich threw the whole responsibility of the measure upon those with whom\r\nit originated, afforded the highest satisfaction in England. Letters\r\nfrom Lord Mornington, Lord Sydney, and others, abound in admiration of\r\nthe firmness of Lord Buckingham's conduct.\r\n\r\nAs had been anticipated, the Address was voted in both Houses of\r\nParliament, and laid before Lord Buckingham for transmission to His\r\nRoyal Highness. His Lordship at once declined to receive it; and in a\r\nshort and explicit answer, rested his refusal on the obligations imposed\r\nupon him by his duty and his oath, adding that he did not feel warranted\r\nin forwarding to His Royal Highness an Address, purporting to invest him\r\nwith powers to take upon him the government of the realm before he\r\nshould be enabled by law to do so. This answer, which had received the\r\nfull approbation of Mr. Pitt, by whom it had been communicated to the\r\nCabinet, was, as might have been expected, deeply resented by the\r\nOpposition, whose hostility to the Government had been all along\r\nassuming that shape of combination in which it now appeared without\r\ndisguise.\r\n\r\nFrustrated in their desire of transmitting this Address through the\r\nchannel of the Lord-Lieutenant, they passed a resolution appointing\r\nambassadors of their own to lay it before His Royal Highness. The\r\npersons nominated to undertake this extraordinary commission were, the\r\nDuke of Leinster, the Earl of Charlemont, Mr. Conolly, Mr. O'Neill, Mr.\r\nPonsonby, and Mr. Stewart. Nor did they stop here. It was necessary to\r\navenge the indignity that had been put upon them; and a resolution,\r\ndeclaring the conduct of Lord Buckingham unwarrantable and\r\nunconstitutional, was accordingly moved by Mr. Grattan, and carried.\r\nThat a resolution still stronger than this, going to the preposterous\r\nlength of declaring the commission of the Lord-Lieutenant actually void\r\nby the will of the Irish Parliament, was at one moment contemplated,\r\nwould appear from a passage in a letter of Mr. Grenville's, dated the\r\n18th of February.\r\n\r\n     I am a little alarmed by one part of your letter, in which you talk\r\n     of a resolution of the two Houses being passed for avoiding your\r\n     commission, and of your resigning the Government in consequence of\r\n     it to Lords Justices appointed under the Act of last year. I trust,\r\n     however, that these favourable accounts [of the King's health] will\r\n     have put this idea out of the question. But if not, for God's sake\r\n     consider whether there is any one principle in which you deny the\r\n     right of the two Houses to appoint a Regent by address, which does\r\n     not apply equally to prove that they cannot either appoint or\r\n     remove a Lord-Lieutenant by resolution. I am persuaded, the more I\r\n     think of it, that it is impossible for you to quit the Government\r\n     in any other manner, than in consequence of a recal from hence, or\r\n     a resignation grounded on the removal of the Ministers here, or on\r\n     the Regent's acceptance of the office, under what you consider an\r\n     illegal appointment.\r\n\r\nMr. Pitt entirely concurred in these views, and it was resolved that\r\nLord Buckingham should remain in Ireland till he had overcome the\r\nconfederacy by which the security of the British power in that kingdom\r\nwas so seriously perilled. In a subsequent letter, Mr. Grenville conveys\r\nthe assurances of Mr. Pitt's determination to support Lord Buckingham in\r\nany measures he should think necessary to the maintenance of the\r\nsupremacy of the Crown, and the vindication of his conduct in these\r\ntransactions. One of the measures which was considered indispensable, as\r\nmarking the sense and upholding the authority of the Government, was the\r\nimmediate dismissal of all those persons who, holding offices and\r\nemoluments under the Crown, had joined in a factious resistance to the\r\npolicy of Ministers.\r\n\r\n     I had, yesterday evening, a long conversation with Pitt on the\r\n     subject of your letter of the 25th. I have already told you that\r\n     his ideas agree entirely with yours as to the proposition of your\r\n     remaining in your present situation long enough to complete your\r\n     victory over this combination, and to establish a Government\r\n     founded on a better system. We both consider it as a point of\r\n     absolute necessity and of indispensable duty, that we should resist\r\n     this profligate conspiracy against the Government of both kingdoms,\r\n     by every means, and to the last extremity; and we agree in thinking\r\n     that this battle ought, both for your own credit and for ours, to\r\n     be fought by you, preferably to any other person. He desires me to\r\n     say that there cannot be the least hesitation here in adopting any\r\n     proposal which you may think it right to make on the subject of\r\n     dismissals, and that his opinion inclines to the immediate removal\r\n     of all the people whom you have named, on the ground not of their\r\n     former votes, but of the combination which is now avowed.\r\n\r\nThe King was now so much better that he was permitted, at his own\r\nrequest, to see the Chancellor, who, however, was prohibited by the\r\nmedical attendants from talking to His Majesty on business. Even this\r\nprohibition was removed in a few days; and Willis considered him so\r\ncompletely recovered that he recommended, as a preliminary experiment to\r\ntest the state of his mind, that the Chancellor should be authorized to\r\ncommunicate to His Majesty the public events which had occurred during\r\nhis illness. Of all men that could have been selected for so delicate an\r\naffair, Thurlow was, perhaps, the worst qualified; but his relation to\r\nthe Crown as Chancellor left Ministers no alternative.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Whitehall, Feb. 19th, 1789.\r\n     MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     The account which you will receive by this post of the King, is as\r\n     favourable as any of the others. This is now the thirteenth day\r\n     since Warren thought him so much--\r\n\r\n     I am agreeably interrupted in my reasoning by the arrival of Pitt,\r\n     who has seen Willis this morning. His account is, that as far as he\r\n     is enabled to judge, the King is _now actually well_. That he is\r\n     not sufficiently acquainted with the sort of effect which the\r\n     peculiar duties of the King's situation produce upon his mind, to\r\n     be able to pronounce as decidedly with respect to him as he would\r\n     in other cases; but that in the instance of any common individual,\r\n     he should not feel the smallest difficulty in pronouncing the cure\r\n     complete, and the patient as capable of attending to his own\r\n     affairs as he had been before his illness. He added that the\r\n     keeping back from the King the present situation of public business\r\n     and the measures which have been taken by Parliament, did him now\r\n     more harm than good, because it created a degree of anxiety and\r\n     uneasiness in his mind. He therefore recommended that the\r\n     Chancellor, whom the King has already seen, and whom he has\r\n     expressed a wish to see again, might go to him, for the purpose of\r\n     explaining to him all that has passed. You will easily imagine that\r\n     this will be an anxious trial for us, because if anything can bring\r\n     back the agitation of his mind, it must be such a recital as\r\n     Thurlow must have to make. It must, however, be made, and we can do\r\n     no more than follow the opinion of the physicians, and of Willis in\r\n     particular, as to the time of making it.\r\n\r\n     If the experiment succeeds, you need not be told that we shall not\r\n     feel ourselves disposed, nor indeed at liberty, to give up the\r\n     King's authority (he being well) into the hands of His Royal\r\n     Highness the Prince of Wales; and the less so, because we now\r\n     _know_ that he and his _friends_, as he calls them, have taken the\r\n     resolution of making the change at all events, and of taking all\r\n     the offices of the country into their own hands, even (as they\r\n     express themselves) if they are to hold them only twelve hours.\r\n\r\n     Certainly, if we looked only to the objects of party, and had\r\n     nothing more important to attend to than the exposing in their true\r\n     colours this profligate and unfeeling set of men, we could desire\r\n     no fairer opportunity of doing it than by showing how much their\r\n     ambition, or revenge, overbear any other sentiment, when it leads\r\n     them to overturn the whole Government of their country, and to\r\n     bring on the confusion which must attend a double change of\r\n     Government in the space of a few weeks, merely in order to set the\r\n     Prince of Wales and Pitt more at variance; for that can be their\r\n     only object, unless indeed they look to that of drawing the line of\r\n     separation between His Royal Highness and his father stronger than\r\n     it was before.\r\n\r\n     We must not, however, be guided by these considerations. It is\r\n     impossible not to know and feel how much mischief such a change\r\n     would produce; and it is our duty to prevent it, both for the sake\r\n     of the King and of the country. Besides which, there are other\r\n     reasons which make it impossible that the present measure should go\r\n     on. We cannot suffer a Bill to proceed which asserts the King's\r\n     incapacity, at a time when his physicians pronounce him to be\r\n     capable. He cannot pass such a Bill himself, because the mere act\r\n     of passing it contradicts the averment of the Bill, and shows its\r\n     provisions to be improper. Still less can the Chancellor, who has\r\n     had an opportunity of being personally acquainted with the King's\r\n     actual restoration to perfect health, receive the orders of any\r\n     other man, or body of men, as to the use of the Great Seal for the\r\n     purpose of expressing the King's pleasure.\r\n\r\n     Our idea, in the present situation, is that the House of Lords\r\n     should adjourn till Monday, in consequence of the Chancellor's\r\n     communicating to them that the state of His Majesty's health is\r\n     such as to make it improper for them to proceed. If nothing\r\n     unfavourable should have occurred by that day, a motion will then\r\n     be made for an examination of the physicians; and that would be\r\n     followed by an Address from both Houses, congratulating the King on\r\n     his recovery. The King would then pass a Commission for\r\n     _proroguing_ the Parliament, and another for opening it again, and\r\n     the business will proceed in the usual form.\r\n\r\n     I think that your object will be to use every possible endeavour,\r\n     by all means in your power, debating every question, dividing upon\r\n     every question, moving adjournment upon adjournment, and every\r\n     other mode that can be suggested to gain time. I do not know that\r\n     we can send you any communication from hence of which _you_ can\r\n     take formal notice by speech or message, till the examinations of\r\n     the physicians are sent to you, which they shall be instantly on\r\n     their being made.\r\n\r\n     But your Ministers, in both Houses, may certainly communicate to\r\n     them what it has been thought right for the Chancellor to say\r\n     to-day, and may make similar motions for adjournments; unless,\r\n     indeed, which I hardly imagine, the whole business is concluded in\r\n     Ireland before you receive the account of this happy event.\r\n\r\n     I have great pleasure in thinking upon the disappointment and\r\n     mortification of those who have deserted you on this occasion. I\r\n     hope in God that you will make up your mind to the remaining where\r\n     you now are long enough to make them feel what they have done, and\r\n     to show that you are not driven away. After this, we shall probably\r\n     agree in thinking that the future Government of Ireland may be\r\n     carried on to more advantage in other hands, because it may\r\n     possibly become of absolute necessity to receive back some of these\r\n     rats into favour, and that is not an occupation in which I should\r\n     like to see you engaged.\r\n\r\n     Unless I understand from Fremantle that he has any business of\r\n     yours to do here, I shall desire him to return to you on Tuesday\r\n     with the examination of the physicians, which will, I hope, be\r\n     presented on that day, or perhaps I may keep him till the Addresses\r\n     are carried.\r\n\r\n     I make you no congratulations on this great event; but it has made\r\n     a deep impression in my heart, and so I am sure it will in yours.\r\n\r\n     God bless you, and believe me ever most affectionately yours,\r\n\r\n     W. W. G.\r\n\r\n     Do not say more of the King's situation than Lord Sydney's despatch\r\n     authorizes, because Willis's name should not be committed after\r\n     what has passed.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Whitehall, Feb. 20th, 1789.\r\n     MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     The House of Commons met to-day and adjourned to Tuesday, without a\r\n     word being said, except from Viner, who desired to hear from Pitt\r\n     an account of the King's real situation. No answer was given, and\r\n     the House adjourned.\r\n\r\n     Pitt has seen the Chancellor since his return from Kew to-day. _He,\r\n     Thurlow_, was with the King to-day for two hours. He did not enter\r\n     into particulars of what had been done, but only in general terms.\r\n     He says that he never saw, at any period, the King more composed,\r\n     collected, or distinct, and that there was not the least trace or\r\n     appearance of disorder.\r\n\r\n     Willis, however, does not allow the cure to be yet quite complete,\r\n     although he thinks it as nearly so as possible. All the other\r\n     medical people seem to think him quite well; but Willis's means of\r\n     information and his experience are so much greater, that we cannot\r\n     but give entire credit to what he says.\r\n\r\n     The Chancellor is to be at Kew again on Sunday. I think our present\r\n     idea is to adjourn the two Houses again from Tuesday to Thursday or\r\n     Saturday. If that is the case, I shall send Fremantle back to you,\r\n     as he tells me he has nothing to detain him here, and it is very\r\n     desirable that Bernard should be on the spot soon, to make his bow\r\n     at Aylesbury.\r\n\r\n     You must not expect to hear from me on any other subject than the\r\n     King's recovery; for nobody here writes, talks, thinks or dreams of\r\n     anything else.\r\n\r\n     Ever most affectionately yours,\r\n     W. W. G.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Whitehall, Feb. 21st, 1789.\r\n     MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     I have little to add to Lord Sydney's letter. Your refusal to\r\n     transmit the Address is generally approved here; and I have the\r\n     pleasure of seeing daily proofs that the Opposition in this country\r\n     are ashamed of what they and their friends have done in Ireland.\r\n     Your answer, I think, much improved by the transposition,\r\n     especially as it avoids the necessity of your submitting any advice\r\n     to His Royal Highness, which might have been said to be an\r\n     officious interference, as you are not in any situation which calls\r\n     upon you to advise _him_.\r\n\r\n     You will hear with as much pleasure as I write it, that the King\r\n     was not at all agitated by his interview with the Chancellor, and\r\n     was perfectly composed and collected all yesterday evening. The\r\n     accounts this morning are as good as can be.\r\n\r\n     Their Royal Highnesses the Prince of Wales and Duke of York have\r\n     been once or twice at Kew, to desire to be admitted _to_ see him,\r\n     which you will naturally suppose was not permitted. This morning\r\n     they thought proper to make a formal demand that they should be\r\n     allowed to see him; or if not, insisting that the physicians should\r\n     give in writing the reasons for their refusal. In consequence of\r\n     this, Warren and Gisborne, who were there this morning, sent Willis\r\n     in to the King, to acquaint him that the two Princes wished to see\r\n     him. Willis returned with a message to them from the King, thanking\r\n     them for their inquiries, but wishing to put off the seeing them\r\n     till he had seen Thurlow again, which he is to do to-morrow. This\r\n     was reduced to writing, and sent to them; how it will be received I\r\n     know not, but it has completely defeated the avowed object of the\r\n     visit, which was to prejudice his mind against the measures which\r\n     have been taken.\r\n\r\n     There seems now every reason to hope that by the 6th or 7th of\r\n     March he will be sufficiently recovered, or rather will have been\r\n     recovered a sufficient time to make it proper to take his commands\r\n     for opening the Parliament. If not, you will see by the despatch\r\n     the nature of the measures which we have in contemplation; and I\r\n     can have no doubt of your agreeing, that no principle which we have\r\n     ever maintained would require or even justify us in putting the\r\n     Prince of Wales in such a situation as to enable him to overturn\r\n     the whole system of the King's Government, the King being all the\r\n     while perfectly well, conscious of what is going forward, and\r\n     restrained from acting himself only by the apprehension of a\r\n     relapse.\r\n\r\n     You will already have seen and considered what I have said to you\r\n     on the subject of remaining. You cannot form to yourself an idea\r\n     how universally it is the wish of all who wish for your own\r\n     personal credit, and of all who are interested for the credit of\r\n     the party, that you should remain in Ireland so long as to make it\r\n     appear that you have thoroughly weathered the storm. Your session\r\n     need be but very short indeed. The uncertain state of everything\r\n     since November last, is an ample apology for not being prepared\r\n     with other business, and for deferring it till another year. But\r\n     the leaving it in the middle, would convey the impression that all\r\n     this difficulty had been personal to yourself, and that you were\r\n     the only obstacle to the success of English Government in Ireland.\r\n     Directly the reverse of this proposition is, I am convinced, the\r\n     truth; but it is a truth which it is of the utmost importance to\r\n     yourself to establish in the general and public opinion in this\r\n     country. You have great advantages for this, from the general\r\n     disposition which is prevalent here to feel the strongest\r\n     indignation at the conduct which your opponents have held. I must\r\n     own it would be a severe mortification to me to see you forego this\r\n     opportunity.\r\n\r\n     You know the only motive which I can have for pressing this so\r\n     much, and how much violence I do to my own feelings when I urge\r\n     anything which may delay my seeing you again.\r\n\r\n     Ever most affectionately yours,\r\n     W. W. G.\r\n\r\nLord Bulkeley, in a letter dated the 24th, describes one of these\r\ninterviews of the Princes with His Majesty. The general impressions\r\nwhich prevailed respecting the conduct and dispositions of their Royal\r\nHighnesses in this crisis, may be gathered from these unreserved\r\nrevelations.\r\n\r\n     The accounts from Kew this morning are as good as possible (but I\r\n     have not got the precise words); notwithstanding, the Princes were\r\n     with him half an hour yesterday, which is a proof that his\r\n     miraculous recovery is not to be shaken. Lord Winchelsea, who was\r\n     at Kew the whole time, told me that the Prince and Duke of York,\r\n     though appointed at one, did not arrive till half-past three; and\r\n     that when they came out, they told Colonel Digby that they were\r\n     delighted with the King's being so well, and remarked that two\r\n     things in the half-hour's conference which they had with him had\r\n     struck them very forcibly: that he had observed to them how much\r\n     better he played at picquet than Mr. Charles Hawkins, and that\r\n     since he had been ill he had rubbed up all his Latin; and these\r\n     facts, which are facts, I expect to hear magnified by the Carlton\r\n     House runners into instances of insanity.\r\n\r\n     The Princes entered the King's apartment without any emotion, and\r\n     came out of it with none visible in their countenances. The Queen\r\n     only was present, and the conference lasted half an hour. I have\r\n     not heard as yet; but conclude they were both rioting, ----, and\r\n     drunk last night at the masquerade, as they were at one a week ago;\r\n     the truth is, that they are quite desperate, and endeavour to\r\n     drown their cares, disappointments, and internal chagrin in wine\r\n     and dissipation.\r\n\r\n     The Duke of York plays much at tennis, and has a score with all the\r\n     blacklegs; and in the public court tells them they shall all be\r\n     paid as soon as his father can settle with him some Osnaburg money\r\n     which he owes him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     The Princes give out, that as soon as they have an opportunity of\r\n     explaining their conduct to the King, they are sure he will approve\r\n     of it as much as he will reprobate that of Mr. Pitt's.\r\n\r\n\"It is now almost certain,\" says Mr. Grenville on the 23rd, \"that we\r\nshall not pass the Regency Bill, and consequently that the Government\r\nwill not be changed.\" In the same letter he refers to a suggestion of\r\nLord Buckingham's, that the answer declining to transmit the Irish\r\nAddress should be laid before His Royal Highness.\r\n\r\n     On conversing with Pitt, we were both clearly of opinion, that no\r\n     communication ought to be made to H.R.H. of what has passed in\r\n     Ireland, as we have uniformly considered him as not entitled, under\r\n     the present circumstances, to any communication of any part of the\r\n     business of Government. Nothing has accordingly been ever laid\r\n     before him, except the measures which Pitt intended to _bring\r\n     forward_ respecting him personally; but that principle certainly\r\n     does not extend to such a communication as had been proposed in\r\n     your separate letter, which I have for that reason not sent to Lord\r\n     Sydney.\r\n\r\nIn so absurd a light, indeed, did the whole proceedings of the Irish\r\nParliament appear to Ministers, that Mr. Grenville thought it highly\r\nimprobable that the Irish Ambassadors, as they were called, would\r\nventure to present the Address in the improved state of the King's\r\nhealth, or that His Royal Highness would be advised to accept it. They\r\n_did_ present it notwithstanding, and their reception is thus reported\r\nby Mr. Grenville:\r\n\r\n     Your Ambassadors are arrived; and presented their Address yesterday\r\n     evening to the Prince. The answer which, as I understand, he gave\r\n     them, was, that he was highly gratified with the expressions of\r\n     _loyalty to the King_, which the Address contained; but that with\r\n     respect to the rest he could not give them an answer before\r\n     Tuesday, on which day he desired to see them again. I take it for\r\n     granted, he will then say, that the King being recovered, all\r\n     consideration of a Regency is out of the question.\r\n\r\n     People in general here do not seem disposed to consider this\r\n     transaction in any other than a ludicrous manner, and as the most\r\n     absurd and ridiculous farce. It is impossible to describe how much\r\n     and how universally their Excellencies are laughed at. One of them\r\n     came into an assembly last night, and was received with a general\r\n     roar of laughter. I did not think they would have been so foolish\r\n     as to present it. The Prince and his friends must have been a good\r\n     deal embarrassed what answer to give them; and I do not think they\r\n     have succeeded remarkably well, if the account of the answer, such\r\n     as I have stated it, is true.\r\n\r\nIt was on the day after the Princes' interview that Mr. Pitt had his\r\nfirst audience of the King since his illness; no Minister, except the\r\nChancellor, having hitherto been admitted to see His Majesty, on account\r\nof the jealousies with which every step they took throughout this\r\npainful interval was watched and turned to account.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Whitehall, Feb. 24th, 1789.\r\n     MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     Pitt has just shown me a letter which he received last night from\r\n     the King, written in His Majesty's own hand, couched in the warmest\r\n     terms, thanking him for his unshaken attachment to his interests,\r\n     and desiring to see him this morning. He went accordingly to Kew,\r\n     and was with the King above an hour. He says that there was not the\r\n     smallest trace or appearance of any disorder; that the King's\r\n     manner was unusually composed and dignified, but that there was no\r\n     other difference whatever from what he had been used to see. The\r\n     King spoke of his disorder as of a thing past, and which had left\r\n     no other impression on his mind than that of gratitude for his\r\n     recovery, and a sense of what he owed to those who had stood by\r\n     him. He spoke of these in such a manner as brought tears into his\r\n     eyes; but even with that degree of affection of mind, there was not\r\n     the least appearance of disorder.\r\n\r\n     After Pitt had left His Majesty, he conversed with Willis, who told\r\n     him that he now thought the King quite well; that he could not\r\n     perceive the least trace remaining of his disorder. Under these\r\n     circumstances, the more I consider our actual situation and what\r\n     seems due to the King's feelings, the more I am persuaded of that\r\n     opinion, to which I think our friends begin in general to lean,\r\n     that the King's resumption of his authority must be done purely by\r\n     his own act, and that it is impossible to hear of any examination\r\n     of physicians.\r\n\r\n     The two Princes were at Kew yesterday, and saw the King, in the\r\n     Queen's apartment. She was present the whole time, a precaution for\r\n     which, God knows, there was but too much reason. They kept him\r\n     waiting a considerable time before they arrived; and after they\r\n     left him, drove immediately to Mrs. Armstead's, in Park Street, in\r\n     hopes of finding Fox there, to give him an account of what had\r\n     passed. He not being in town, they amused themselves yesterday\r\n     evening with spreading about a report that the King was still out\r\n     of his mind, and in quoting phrases of his to which they gave that\r\n     turn. It is certainly a decent and becoming thing, that when all\r\n     the King's physicians, all his attendants, and his two principal\r\n     Ministers, agree in pronouncing him well, his two sons should deny\r\n     it. And the reflection that the Prince of Wales was to have had the\r\n     Government and the Duke of York the command of the army during his\r\n     illness, makes this representation of his actual state, when coming\r\n     from them, more peculiarly proper and edifying. I bless God it is\r\n     yet some time before these _matured and ripened virtues_ will be\r\n     _visited upon us_ in the form of a Government.\r\n\r\n     Believe me ever most affectionately yours,\r\n     W. W. G.\r\n\r\nActing on the _carte blanche_ which he had asked, and which had been\r\nfreely accorded to him, respecting dismissals, appointments, and\r\ncreations, Lord Buckingham proceeded at once to redress the balance of\r\npower in Ireland, by dismissing from their offices the persons who had\r\nrecently opposed the conduct of the Government on the Regency question.\r\nA similar course had been pursued in England on His Majesty's recovery.\r\nMr. Grenville mentions specially \"the justice which had been executed on\r\nLord Lothian\" in this way, the King taking his troop from him, and\r\nsending him to join another in Ireland. \"The joke current here,\" says\r\nMr. Grenville, \"is, that the Irish Ambassadors came over here to\r\nLothian's hotel, and that the King sends Lothian to return the visit.\"\r\nIn Ireland the disaffection had been more dangerous and extensive, and\r\ndemanded more severe measures.\r\n\r\nThe moment it was known that the King was recovered, a negotiation was\r\nopened with the Government through Mr. Fitzgibbon, then\r\nAttorney-General, by the principal members of the Lords and Commons who\r\nhad supported the Address, tendering their submission, and asking for an\r\namnesty. It has been stated in some publications referring to these\r\nproceedings, that the negotiations were opened by Government; but Lord\r\nBuckingham's official despatch, dated the 23rd of March, not only shows\r\nthat statement to be erroneous, but establishes the fact that Lord\r\nBuckingham peremptorily refused to entertain the negotiation until he\r\nshould have received a positive assurance that a certain defensive and\r\nhostile agreement, into which those gentlemen had entered, was to be\r\nconsidered as abandoned. This agreement, or association, was called the\r\nRound Robin (although not really a round robin, being merely a\r\ndeclaration, followed in the usual way by the signatures of the\r\nsubscribers), pledging those who attached their names to it to \"stand by\r\neach other\" (to use the phrase by which Mr. Beresford described it) in\r\nthe event of their offices or pensions being taken from them, and to\r\noppose any Administration that should resort to such a proceeding.\r\n\r\nFinding Lord Buckingham immoveable upon the condition he stipulated for,\r\nLords Shannon, Loftus, Clifden, and many others, authorized the\r\nAttorney-General to declare the association at an end, adding that they\r\ndesired to be represented to His Majesty as anxious to support his\r\nGovernment, and to endeavour to remove by their future conduct all\r\nunfavourable impressions from his mind. In the wise exercise of the\r\ndiscretion reposed in him, Lord Buckingham accepted this voluntary\r\ntender of allegiance, and permitted the gentlemen who had made it to\r\nretain their offices. The Duke of Leinster, who had been only recently\r\nappointed to the Rolls, and Mr. Ponsonby, who held the situation of\r\nPostmaster-General, refusing to give the required undertaking,\r\naggravated, in the case of the latter, by a declaration that he would\r\nnot enter into any communication with Lord Buckingham, were at once\r\ndismissed from their offices. This dismissal was followed by that of a\r\nfew others of less note.\r\n\r\nThese energetic measures were founded, not only on the dangerous\r\nresistance these gentlemen had carried to extremity, at a period of\r\nanxious suspense and universal excitement, against the Government, but\r\nupon a knowledge of the existence of an organized combination they had\r\nembarked in with the English Opposition to supersede the authority of\r\nthe Sovereign in the person of the Regent. In order the more effectually\r\nto accomplish their objects, they had seized upon every act of the\r\nAdministration, and held it up to obloquy. A pension which had been\r\ngranted to Mr. Orde, and the reversion of Lord Clanbrassil's office\r\nwhich had been conferred on Mr. Grenville, afforded them a pretext for\r\ncharging the Government with corruption and profligacy. They opened\r\ntheir impeachment at the very beginning of the session, in February,\r\ndefeated the motion for adjournment, carried their Address at the\r\nsacrifice of their own dignity and independence, and were only arrested\r\nat last in their headlong career by those vigorous measures which broke\r\nup the combination, and once more gave a legitimate preponderance in the\r\nSenate to the saving influence of the Administration. The effect of the\r\n_coup d'etat_--for as such these dismissals may be considered--was\r\ndecisive. The hostile majority was broken down; and when Mr. Grattan,\r\nstill confident in his resources, brought forward his Pension Bill, to\r\ndisable persons who held pensions during pleasure, or offices that had\r\nbeen created after a certain time, from sitting in Parliament, he was\r\ndefeated by a majority of 9. This was justly claimed as a conclusive\r\nvictory by a Government that had only just before been denounced in a\r\nvote of censure in the same assembly by a majority of 32.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that the happy and unexpected recovery of His Majesty\r\naverted a struggle that might have gone near to dissolve the connection\r\nof the Executive authority between the two kingdoms; for, had His\r\nMajesty's illness continued much longer, there is too much reason to\r\nbelieve that His Royal Highness would have been advised to accept the\r\ninvitation of the Irish Parliament, by which he would have been created\r\nRegent of Ireland, with full powers, before an Act of Parliament had\r\npassed in England under the Great Seal empowering him to assume the\r\nfunctions of Sovereignty. The confusion that would have ensued upon such\r\na state of affairs, and the disastrous issues to which it would have\r\ninevitably led, cannot be contemplated, even at this distance of time,\r\nwithout an expression of astonishment that men were to be found capable\r\nof entertaining such a proposition. The heroic endurance of Lord\r\nBuckingham, upon whom the whole weight of contending against the madness\r\nin which this scene of folly and violence originated, enabled him,\r\nhappily for the repose of both countries, to live down the dangers and\r\nthe odium which his steadfast discharge of his duties, and his firm\r\nadherence to the policy of the English Cabinet, had drawn upon him\r\nduring this season of political delirium. His own impressions of the\r\nscene around him, and the strength of the resolution he brought to bear\r\nupon it, will be shown in an extract from a hasty note written to Lord\r\nBulkeley, in the midst of the clamour of the Parliament, on the 14th of\r\nMarch.\r\n\r\n     I have not shrunk from my duty in the worst times, and I will not\r\n     trifle with it in those which look more prosperous. Much must be\r\n     done to save the British Government from an infamous and daring\r\n     combination, which might have been yielded to by a more\r\n     pusillanimous minister; but could only be met by one confident in\r\n     his character and conduct. Do not think this the language of\r\n     vanity; the times have been, and still are much too serious for\r\n     such a boyish passion: I feel that the dearest interests of both\r\n     kingdoms are at stake, and nothing but firmness can save it. I have\r\n     been insulted, I may be beat, but I will not be disgraced.\r\n\r\nWhen the victory was finally achieved, he writes again to Lord Bulkeley\r\nin a strain of justifiable exultation, announcing his complete triumph\r\nover the Opposition. The letter is dated the 4th May, and the passage\r\nextracted from it contains an animated picture of the strife through\r\nwhich the writer had just passed.\r\n\r\n     I told you, two months ago, that my friends would not blush for\r\n     me--that I might be beaten, but that I would not be disgraced. I\r\n     write to you now in the moment, and with the transports of the\r\n     warmest exultation and of honest pride, to tell you, that on\r\n     Saturday night I closed the session in the House of Commons, having\r\n     thrown out every measure brought forward by Opposition. They would\r\n     not divide after their second defeat, where, though our majority\r\n     was the same, yet, as fewer members voted, it was more in\r\n     proportion than before; and the illness of Lord Clanbrassil and of\r\n     Lord Lifford lost us three votes. The House of Lords still sits for\r\n     a cause which they are hearing, and for some private Bills. The\r\n     House of Commons adjourned to Friday, and on that day both Houses\r\n     adjourn to the 25th, when I shall pass the Bills, and shall finally\r\n     prorogue them.\r\n\r\n     In the space then of six weeks, I have secured to the Crown a\r\n     decided and steady majority, created in the teeth of the Duke of\r\n     Leinster, Lord Shannon, Lord Granard, Ponsonby, Conolly, O'Neil,\r\n     united to all the republicanism, the faction, and the discontents\r\n     of the House of Commons; and having thrown this aristocracy at the\r\n     feet of the King, I have taught to the British and Irish Government\r\n     a lesson which ought never to be forgotten; and I have the pride to\r\n     recollect that the whole of it is fairly to be ascribed to the\r\n     steady decision with which the storm was met, and to the zeal,\r\n     vigour, and industry of some of the steadiest friends that ever man\r\n     was blessed with.\r\n\r\nWhile these anxious events were passing in Ireland, the old passion of\r\nthe King for interfering with military promotions, as if he were\r\nresolved, as Mr. Grenville remarks, to absorb that branch of patronage,\r\ninvolved Lord Buckingham and the Cabinet in another series of protocols\r\nsimilar to those which passed concerning Colonel Gwynne's appointment.\r\nAnother lieutenant-colonelcy had fallen vacant, and Lord Buckingham\r\ndesired that it should be bestowed on his nephew, Colonel Nugent, who\r\nhad been disappointed of a similar favour on the former occasion; but\r\nHis Majesty directed that it should be given to Colonel Taylor. Even Mr.\r\nGrenville, who exercised a philosophical patience in these matters, was\r\nso hurt at the manner in which Lord Buckingham's wishes were passed\r\nover, at a time when he was rendering such signal services to the Crown,\r\nthat he could not restrain the expression of his dissatisfaction.\r\nWriting to Lord Buckingham, he says:\r\n\r\n     I feel that I would be unworthy, not only of your confidence and\r\n     affection, but of the name and character of a gentleman, if I did\r\n     not warmly partake of your just resentment at this gross and\r\n     unmerited offence, offered at a moment when your conduct had\r\n     entitled you to so very different a line of treatment.\r\n\r\nLord Buckingham was again on the point of resigning, and Mr. Grenville\r\nparticipated so strongly in his feelings that he indicated his\r\ndetermination of following his example. After stating in a subsequent\r\nletter that he thought he saw in the King's mind \"a strong wish to take\r\ninto his own hands this piece of military patronage _whenever it\r\nfalls_,\" he proceeds to observe upon the consequences.\r\n\r\n     The whole transaction gives me the greatest uneasiness, because I\r\n     am not afraid to say to you, fairly and openly, that the measures\r\n     to which, I fear, you may ultimately be driven in consequence of it\r\n     are of a nature which I fear extremely; and _that_, I trust, for\r\n     better reasons than any consideration of their effect on my views.\r\n     It is on every account a most critical and embarrassing moment for\r\n     you; and the sense which I entertain of the injustice of those who\r\n     have brought you into this situation, does not remove or diminish\r\n     my apprehensions of the consequences to which it leads. It is no\r\n     affectation or parade of disinterestedness, but the necessary\r\n     consequence of the first principles of justice and honour, when I\r\n     assure you that I am resolved to follow your decision upon it, and\r\n     that I consider your honour as inseparably connected with my own.\r\n\r\nFortunately, however, this solution of the difficulty was rendered\r\nunnecessary. A compromise, as usual, afforded a convenient escape to all\r\nparties, without disappointing any; and by an ingenious re-distribution\r\nof three or four regiments (devised by His Majesty himself), Taylor was\r\nprovided for elsewhere, and Nugent obtained his lieutenant-colonelcy.\r\nThere was great difficulty, nevertheless, in bringing His Majesty to\r\nthis point. He had made up his mind to give the vacant regiment to\r\nTaylor, and would hear of no one else. \"I am truly sorry to say,\"\r\nobserves Mr. Pitt, in the course of the negotiations, \"that he seems\r\nthoroughly determined not to yield, and I am sure no consideration will\r\ninduce him to agree to any other arrangement.\" Had it depended solely on\r\nthe disposition of the King, the difference would never have been\r\nadjusted, and Lord Buckingham, stung by these repeated indignities,\r\nmight have thrown up his Government at a conjuncture when his retirement\r\nmust have plunged the country into anarchy. How seriously this step was\r\ncontemplated by him and Mr. Grenville will appear from the following\r\ncorrespondence:\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Whitehall, April 7th, 1789.\r\n     MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     I have just received your letter of the 3rd, and though I have\r\n     nothing new to say to you upon the point of Captain Taylor, he not\r\n     having yet sent his answer, I cannot help writing a few lines, lest\r\n     you think the subject is out of my mind. With respect to the\r\n     promotions of peerage, the fault, if there is any, is mine; because\r\n     I felt, and still continue to feel, that under the present\r\n     circumstances, and till this business of Taylor is settled, the\r\n     other _ought_ to be postponed; nor can I imagine any real\r\n     inconvenience to arise from it. I am, however, by no means sanguine\r\n     in my expectations of the event of this business. I have already\r\n     expressed to you my sense of the King's treatment of you in this\r\n     instance, and my determination to abide by any measures that you\r\n     may think it right to take in this situation. I cannot, however, in\r\n     justice to you or to myself, avoid saying, that I most sincerely\r\n     wish you to consider well the step which you are about to take; and\r\n     that not only with a reference to your _present_ situation or to\r\n     your _immediate_ feelings, but with a view to the interpretation\r\n     which the public will put upon it, and with a view to any future\r\n     political object of ours. With respect to the latter, I am\r\n     persuaded you must see that it is impossible for you to resign the\r\n     Lord-Lieutenancy of Ireland at this time, and on this ground,\r\n     without making up your mind at the same moment finally to renounce\r\n     all ideas of our taking any part hereafter as public men in this\r\n     country. If you will consider what our situation would be, after\r\n     such a step, with the King, with the Prince, with Pitt's friends,\r\n     and with Fox, and lastly with the public at large, you will, I am\r\n     sure, think that the consequence which I state is not overstrained.\r\n\r\n     I can, without affectation, assure you, that though I am not\r\n     indifferent either to the recollection of what we have already\r\n     done, or to the prospects which are now before us; yet that I could\r\n     perfectly well make up my mind to a different line of life, and\r\n     that I am confident I possess sufficient resources within myself to\r\n     reconcile myself to such a step, provided it were taken for an\r\n     object which I felt to be _tanti_. And such I certainly do consider\r\n     the object of marking to you, and to the world, and of discharging,\r\n     in a manner satisfactory to my own feelings, my gratitude and\r\n     affectionate attachment to you, in an instance where I entirely\r\n     agree with you in thinking you ill-treated, at a time when you had\r\n     deserved best.\r\n\r\n     It remains, therefore, for _you_ to consider what step it may be\r\n     best for you to take under all the present circumstances. Even if\r\n     your mind should ultimately lean to the idea of resigning, I should\r\n     certainly strongly press you not to carry this idea into effect\r\n     till you have closed your session in Ireland; and in this advice,\r\n     at least, I am certainly disinterested, because my situation would,\r\n     in the interim, be more disagreeable and embarrassing than it could\r\n     be under _any_ other circumstances. But I am _sure_ that if you\r\n     were to quit _immediately_, as you now talk of doing, you never\r\n     could induce any one to believe that this step was not taken with a\r\n     view to escape from present difficulties, instead of being intended\r\n     to mark your sense of personal ill-treatment; and that when the\r\n     impression of the present moment upon your feelings was over, you\r\n     never would forgive yourself for having concluded the transactions\r\n     of this winter by such a termination.\r\n\r\n     I have only to add that I am not indifferent, and that I am\r\n     persuaded you are not, to the public consequences of our conduct.\r\n     It is one of the circumstances which are necessarily attendant\r\n     upon a public situation and a public line of life, that a person\r\n     who is engaged in it cannot act even in those points which most\r\n     nearly concern himself without producing consequences which are\r\n     often of great public importance. It will certainly not be a\r\n     pleasant reflection to me to have materially contributed to the\r\n     overthrow of that system of public men and public measures which I\r\n     believe to be of the utmost importance to the welfare and\r\n     prosperity of my country. On the best reflection which I can give\r\n     to the subject, weighing what I owe to you and to myself, and what\r\n     I owe to others, I shall feel myself _justified_, whatever may be\r\n     the consequences; but certainly my feelings upon them will be such\r\n     as to prevent my ever again putting myself into a similar\r\n     situation, even if the circumstances to which I have alluded in the\r\n     beginning of this letter did not, as they probably will, render\r\n     such an event absolutely impossible.\r\n\r\n     When I speak of contributing to the overthrow of the present system\r\n     you certainly understand me to refer to the probable consequences\r\n     of our withdrawing ourselves from it, and not to any idea of your\r\n     being led, which I am persuaded is impossible, to contribute\r\n     actively to the triumph of a most wicked and profligate faction. I\r\n     should feel that I gave you just cause of offence, if I thought it\r\n     necessary to say, that this is a point to which no consideration\r\n     could lead me.\r\n\r\n     You will excuse me if I have said so much in this letter upon my\r\n     own subject, in treating of a point which relates to your conduct\r\n     and to your situation. I feel that the two subjects are too\r\n     intimately connected for me to speak of them separately, and I felt\r\n     that you could not but be desirous, in the moment of deciding a\r\n     step so interesting to us both, that I should open my heart to you\r\n     in as free and unrestrained a manner as I have now done.\r\n\r\n     One thing more I must recommend to your serious consideration.\r\n     Nothing is clearer to my mind than the propriety of the step you\r\n     have taken in dismissing Ponsonby, of the intimation which you have\r\n     given to Lord Shannon of the necessary consequences of his present\r\n     conduct, and of the measures you have adopted for securing to\r\n     yourself efficient assistance by the removal of Fitzherbert, and by\r\n     the nomination of Hobart on the persuasion which you entertain of\r\n     his ability to serve you. But I must entreat you to reflect that\r\n     this line of conduct is only to be justified on the supposition of\r\n     your being to remain in Ireland; while, on the other hand,\r\n     entertaining as you now do the idea of quitting your situation, it\r\n     is surely a duty which you owe to yourself, as well as to the\r\n     public, to leave to your successor his decision as free and open as\r\n     your own is now, on points which may be of such infinite importance\r\n     to his Government. To have failed in this instance would, I am\r\n     sure, much add to the many grounds of regret which will press\r\n     themselves upon your mind.\r\n\r\n     I will say no more on all these points. I have now written you a\r\n     dissertation, instead of a few lines, as I had intended, but my\r\n     anxiety on the subject has drawn me on. The groundwork of all this\r\n     difficulty may, after all, be removed by Taylor's refusal, or by\r\n     Pitt's exertions; but I again repeat that I am not sanguine on that\r\n     head, and it is certainly more reasonable that we should prepare\r\n     our minds for a contrary event.\r\n\r\n     Believe me ever, my dear brother,\r\n     Most affectionately yours,\r\n     W. W. G.\r\n\r\n     Why should you feel yourself offended because particular marks of\r\n     favour have been shown to Burrard and Lenox, two most steady, warm,\r\n     and deserving friends of ours at all times, and in all\r\n     circumstances?\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     April 10th, 1789.\r\n     MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     I have just received your letter of the 7th, and feel myself bound\r\n     to answer the question which you put to me as directly and as\r\n     explicitly as I am able to do. The business remains hitherto in the\r\n     same situation as when I wrote last to you. A further answer has\r\n     been received from Major Taylor, in which he still persists in his\r\n     former refusal; but by some confusion about dates, it is not\r\n     perfectly clear whether this is his final answer to the\r\n     notification which had been made to him, that he must renounce his\r\n     further expectations from the King if he refuses this. We were\r\n     desirous to delay any communication with the King upon the subject,\r\n     till it was perfectly clear that the plea of his engagement to\r\n     Taylor was removed by the refusal of the latter, because we thought\r\n     that, under those circumstances, the representation of what was due\r\n     to you would come with greater force. I am, however, obliged to say\r\n     that there is a further difficulty, even supposing this of Taylor\r\n     to be removed by his refusal. The King has destined _his_ Majority\r\n     of Dragoons to Garth, one of his equerries, and has had the folly\r\n     and precipitation to communicate this intention to Garth. Under\r\n     these circumstances, it appears doubtful whether even a final\r\n     refusal from Taylor would remove the plea of actual engagement, and\r\n     whether Nugent's appointment would not still meet with the same\r\n     difficulty on account of its not opening a Majority of Dragoons for\r\n     Garth. You will observe that I speak only from a general idea of\r\n     the King's feelings and habits of thinking and acting on these\r\n     subjects, when I state these probable difficulties, but that I have\r\n     no further information as to his disposition in this particular\r\n     instance, than I had when I wrote to you last.\r\n\r\n     This will, however, now be brought in some measure to a point, as\r\n     Pitt and myself have agreed that there should be no further delay;\r\n     but that he should now write to the King to state Taylor's last\r\n     answer of refusal, and to express his hope, that in consequence of\r\n     this, His Majesty will, under all the circumstances of the case, be\r\n     disposed to comply with your recommendation of Colonel Nugent.\r\n\r\n     It has occurred to us, that even if the King should obstinately\r\n     persist in a refusal on this occasion, there is another solution\r\n     which you might possibly deem satisfactory. You will recollect that\r\n     the business of Colonel Gwynne closed last year, by the King's\r\n     consenting that Nugent should have the office of Adjutant-General,\r\n     provided any arrangement could be made by you for Faucitt. Neither\r\n     Pitt nor myself ever knew from you on what point your negotiation\r\n     with Faucitt broke off. But if that could be renewed, Pitt\r\n     authorizes me to say that he could find the means of opening a ten\r\n     Sh. Government for him in England immediately, and that he has no\r\n     doubt of the King's consent to the arrangement, even preceding the\r\n     signing Taylor's commission.\r\n\r\n     You, however, will best know how far this mode of arranging the\r\n     business would be satisfactory to you, and what probability there\r\n     would be of bringing it to bear, with the assistance which I state.\r\n     If you feel this to be impossible, there will then remain nothing\r\n     but to press the King on the other point as far as possible, and at\r\n     last, if it is found absolutely necessary, to give him to\r\n     understand that his option must be made between his Major Taylor\r\n     and his Major Garth on the one hand, and his Lord-Lieutenant of\r\n     Ireland on the other. You do justice to the manner in which I have\r\n     felt and written to you on this occasion, and it is extremely\r\n     satisfactory to me to know that you are not insensible to the\r\n     warmth and sincerity of my affection and gratitude towards you. Let\r\n     me therefore, upon that ground, presume so far only as to beg that\r\n     you will not send your resignation, or notify formally (or indeed\r\n     in any other manner) your intention so to do, till you learn from\r\n     me that I am convinced all other steps will be ineffectual. I\r\n     persuade myself that this is a trust which you will not believe me\r\n     capable of abusing, however unwilling I must be, on so many\r\n     accounts, to see you driven to the necessity of taking this last\r\n     and decisive step.\r\n\r\n     I mentioned also to you, in my last letter, the reasons which I\r\n     feel for wishing that, in all events, the actual execution of this\r\n     measure may be delayed till the conclusion of the session. I press\r\n     this for reasons personal to you, and which I feel very strongly,\r\n     although the interval will unquestionably be very embarrassing to\r\n     you, and perhaps even more distressing to myself. But I am desirous\r\n     of knowing how far you feel the force of those reasons, and what\r\n     your determination would be in that case, because I think it might\r\n     make some difference in the manner of stating your intention to the\r\n     King, if this should be rendered necessary.\r\n\r\n     I feel it needless to repeat to you what I have already said of my\r\n     intentions respecting my own conduct; and I hope you do me the\r\n     justice to believe, that however deeply I am involved in the result\r\n     of this business, my first anxiety is that it may terminate in a\r\n     manner consistent with your honour, character, and happiness.\r\n\r\n     Believe me, my dear brother,\r\n     Most affectionately yours,\r\n     W. W. G.\r\n\r\n\r\n     MR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Holwood, April 12th, 1789.\r\n     MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     As I understand that Mr. Pitt writes to you by this messenger, in\r\n     order to state to you the nature of the King's answer to his\r\n     letter, and to explain the arrangement which is proposed to you as\r\n     a solution of this unpleasant business, I feel that I can have\r\n     nothing to add. I have already mentioned to you, in the most full\r\n     and unreserved manner, the whole of my feelings on this occasion,\r\n     and I see nothing in the present state of it which can at all vary\r\n     them. I still continue very desirous that this business may not\r\n     proceed to those extremities which you have mentioned, because I\r\n     think such a step, independent of its public consequences, would\r\n     close our political prospects in this country, and would, besides,\r\n     be liable to a construction which we should most wish to avoid. But\r\n     I also continue in the full determination to abide by your decision\r\n     upon it, and that your conduct shall regulate mine; because I feel\r\n     this as no less due to myself than to you, on an occasion in which\r\n     I certainly think the King has been much wanting to you.\r\n\r\n     If I were to write volumes to you, I could only enlarge upon these\r\n     points, on which I have already fully written to you, and with the\r\n     same freedom and sincerity as if I were thinking aloud. I always\r\n     feel some embarrassment and difficulty in writing upon points in\r\n     which I am myself so much interested; although I have not, on this\r\n     occasion, suffered that consideration to weigh with me, so as\r\n     either to say what I should not otherwise have said, or to leave\r\n     unsaid anything which I felt I ought to say. I have now, therefore,\r\n     only to conclude, with my sincere assurances of the uniform and\r\n     warm affection with which I am,\r\n\r\n     My dear brother, most truly yours,\r\n     W. W. G.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Whitehall, April 16th, 1789.\r\n     MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     I came to town yesterday with Mr. Pitt, and found your letter of\r\n     the 11th, and this morning I received yours of the 12th. I was much\r\n     mortified that I was not able to write to you yesterday evening,\r\n     as I had intended to do, first by the post, and afterwards by a\r\n     messenger. But different circumstances arose, which made it\r\n     impossible. I could have wished to have answered your letter at\r\n     length, in order to state to you everything that occurs to me upon\r\n     it; but I cannot now do this without unnecessarily delaying the\r\n     messenger, and I wish to lose no time in letting you know the exact\r\n     state of the business, as it now stands. Taylor has accepted, which\r\n     considerably increases the difficulty of making a point with the\r\n     King to undo what he has done for him. But another solution has now\r\n     offered itself, on which I cannot help feeling rather sanguine. We\r\n     have just heard of the death of General Mackay: Pitt is now writing\r\n     to the King, to represent the propriety of making any arrangement,\r\n     which this event may give rise to, subservient to the purpose of\r\n     removing this difficulty, and to desire to see the King, in order\r\n     to converse with him upon that point. The King will probably\r\n     appoint to-morrow; but as Pitt may not be back till late, I thought\r\n     it better to send off this messenger, as my letter is now a day\r\n     later than I meant to have written, and I can easily judge of your\r\n     impatience to hear from me on this subject.\r\n\r\n     Lodge Morres will be instantly dismissed, with such a letter as you\r\n     mention.\r\n\r\n     You shall hear from me again to-morrow, or Saturday, at latest. I\r\n     hope you have not taken any step on the receipt of our letters of\r\n     Sunday; but if any letter of formal resignation comes from you, I\r\n     should feel myself justified, under these circumstances, to stop\r\n     it.\r\n\r\n     In answer to your questions about Pitt, I beg you to believe that,\r\n     however warm and sincere my friendship is for him, yet that it\r\n     would not stand one moment in the way, if I thought him acting\r\n     dishonourably or unfairly by you. I may, to-morrow, have time to\r\n     write more at large on that subject; but, in the meantime, let me\r\n     assure you that I am the grossest dupe in the world if that is the\r\n     case. I am impatient to hear the result of Monday.\r\n\r\n     Ever most affectionately yours,\r\n     W. W. G.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Whitehall, April 17th, 1789.\r\n     MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     I have the greatest pleasure in being able to acquaint you that\r\n     this unpleasant business of the lieutenant-colonelcy is now in a\r\n     way of being settled, so as, I hope, may be perfectly satisfactory\r\n     to you. I have just seen Mr. Pitt, and received from him the\r\n     agreeable information that he found the King entirely disposed to\r\n     do whatever might conduce to this object, and even _desirous_ of\r\n     explaining that the former difficulties had arisen only from his\r\n     actual engagements. It is not yet precisely settled in what mode\r\n     this should be done; because, Mr. Pitt finding the King in so\r\n     favourable a disposition on the subject, thought it better, on\r\n     every account, to avoid pressing him further than appeared\r\n     necessary. Two modes were, however, suggested in conversation\r\n     between them: the one, that General Ainslie should have Mackay's\r\n     regiment, by which means his lieutenant-colonelcy should be given\r\n     to Taylor, and so Nugent be appointed to Gwynne's; the other, that\r\n     the regiment should be given to Sir James Stewart Denham, which\r\n     would vacate his lieutenant-colonelcy for Nugent. A third was also\r\n     mentioned by the King, namely, the inducing Taylor, by the offer of\r\n     the Lieutenant-Governorship of Cowes, to exchange with Nugent. Any\r\n     one of these would, I flatter myself, answer your purpose; because\r\n     they would show the King's disposition to attend to your\r\n     recommendation, and that having been hampered by an actual\r\n     engagement to Taylor, he is now ready to accommodate his own\r\n     patronage in such a way as may, at the same time, provide for\r\n     Nugent. But what I think even better than all this, is the account\r\n     which Pitt gave me of the King's apparent manner of feeling on this\r\n     subject. I had, I confess, very much apprehended that, however\r\n     necessary it might be, in order to keep up your situation and\r\n     apparent weight with the King, to insist upon some such solution\r\n     for this business, yet that the doing this would leave a lasting\r\n     and most unfavourable impression on his mind, which might lead to a\r\n     renewal of this sort of contest on some future occasion. This\r\n     appears to be by no means the case, at present; and I am sure that\r\n     you will agree with me in thinking that although it might, in some\r\n     points of view, have been desirable that the whole arrangement\r\n     could have been concluded to-day, so as to put an end to all\r\n     appearance of suspense, yet that it would have been unwise, in this\r\n     state of things, to have pressed the King to this sort of\r\n     peremptory decision as to the mode of doing it, which he seemed\r\n     desirous of having an opportunity of revolving in his own mind.\r\n\r\n     It will now probably not be very long before whatever official\r\n     business you will have in this country, will pass through a medium\r\n     rather better disposed, and more attentive to you, than that of\r\n     your present correspondent; and if I do not grossly flatter myself,\r\n     a little attention on my part, to soothe the King's mind--which has\r\n     evidently been irritated on these points--will make all this sort\r\n     of business go smoothly, and to your satisfaction.\r\n\r\n     I am sorry not to have complied with your wish about the\r\n     promotions; but, on very mature reflection, I was persuaded that it\r\n     was risking too much, with regard to the principal and important\r\n     point, to mix with it any other business on which it was always\r\n     possible that some difficulty might arise in the King's mind. In\r\n     the course of the next week, I hope to be able to write to you on\r\n     that subject; but I trust you will not be unwilling to rely a\r\n     little on me with regard to the exact time, which I assure you I\r\n     will not delay, except I think I see very material reasons for it.\r\n     You must also make some allowance for the very great additional\r\n     delay which is created in all this sort of business, by the King's\r\n     residing wholly at Windsor, which gives Pitt fewer opportunities of\r\n     seeing him, and for a shorter time.\r\n\r\n     I mentioned to you, in my last letter, that Lodge Morres would be\r\n     immediately removed. I have desired that the letter notifying this,\r\n     may contain some such expressions as you mention; but I cannot\r\n     answer for this, because I cannot, as things now stand, interfere\r\n     in the wording of those letters, except by a very circuitous mode.\r\n\r\n     I also answered your question about Pitt, but I did it shortly; nor\r\n     indeed could any expressions that I could have used do justice to\r\n     the warm and anxious feeling which he has shown on this occasion. I\r\n     am inclined to impute this termination of the business, so much\r\n     more favourable than I had expected, almost entirely to his\r\n     judgment and address.\r\n\r\n     I have had the pleasure this morning of seeing Lady B. and your\r\n     children. You will have heard that she has had a feverish cold, but\r\n     I hope it has now quite left her. Your children are all well.\r\n\r\n     Adieu, my dear brother. I cannot express to you what a weight is\r\n     removed from my mind by the success of Pitt's journey.\r\n\r\n     Ever most affectionately yours,\r\n     W. W. G.\r\n\r\nThe promotions and creations glanced at in these letters were\r\nrecommended by Lord Buckingham as proper marks of His Majesty's sense of\r\nthe services rendered to the Government during the late crisis in\r\nIreland by some influential men in both Houses of Parliament. As those\r\nwho had abandoned the Administration were dismissed, it was no less an\r\nact of justice that those who had supported it should receive some\r\ntestimony of the King's approbation, and the Lord-Lieutenant's _carte\r\nblanche_ embraced this dispensing power on both sides. Some alarm was\r\nfelt by the Cabinet at the list of promotions and creations (nineteen in\r\nnumber) forwarded on this occasion for the royal sanction. The increase\r\nof the peerage was, perhaps, the only point on which Mr. Pitt's\r\nGovernment was vulnerable, for, although he exercised the greatest\r\ncaution in his selections, and introduced them by degrees, instead of\r\nmaking them in batches, as the peculiar circumstances of Ireland at this\r\nmoment demanded, it was felt to be the objection which, of all others,\r\noperated most injuriously against the character and popularity of his\r\nAdministration. His Majesty's engagements, too, enhanced the\r\nembarrassment. Whenever any proposition for honours or appointments,\r\nnaval, military, or civil, was submitted to him, it was certain to be\r\nobstructed by some obligation he had previously laid himself under by\r\npromise to different persons. In the present instance a difficulty of\r\nthis kind interposed. Two peerages were already engaged in advance, and\r\nthe arrangement of the Irish list depended entirely on the nature of the\r\npledges to which His Majesty had committed himself in these cases. Mr.\r\nGrenville writes that Mr. Pitt was to see His Majesty on the subject in\r\ntwo or three days. \"He will then endeavour to find out whether the\r\nKing's engagements were so positive and absolute as to Lords A. and C.\r\nas to lay him under the absolute necessity of conferring this honour on\r\nfour persons in order to be able to reward the services of two.\" It may\r\nbe presumed that these engagements were not absolute, or, at all\r\nevents, that they were not suffered to interfere with Lord Buckingham's\r\nlist, as all the persons he named, with the exception of two or three,\r\nwho were excluded on special grounds, received the honours to which he\r\nrecommended them.\r\n\r\nAmongst these was Mr. Fitzgibbon, Poor old Lord Lifford, who had kept\r\nhis seat, and exerted himself indefatigably to the last, died on the\r\n28th of April. The labours of that terrible session proved too much for\r\nhis declining powers, and he finally sank under them. The opportunity to\r\nwhich Mr. Fitzgibbon had been so long looking forward was now thrown\r\nopen to him. Lord Buckingham pressed his claims earnestly on the\r\nGovernment, recounting the signal obligations he had laid them under on\r\nthe Regency question, tracing his career, and depicting his character in\r\nterms of the highest eulogy. The appointment rested with Thurlow, whose\r\nhumours required to be waited upon, and who was suspected, moreover, to\r\nbe unfavourable to Fitzgibbon. Much delay and suspense consequently\r\nensued, and it was not until June that the patent was made out.\r\nFitzgibbon was immediately created a Baron. From that point his\r\npromotion in the peerage advanced rapidly. In 1793, he was created\r\nViscount Fitzgibbon; and in 1795, Earl of Clare.\r\n\r\nThe King's recovery now enabled Ministers to resume those measures which\r\nthe late unhappy suspension of public affairs had so grievously\r\ninterrupted. One of the first subjects that called for consideration was\r\nthe abolition of the Slave Trade. Mr. Wilberforce had succeeded in\r\nraising such an excitement throughout the country about his forthcoming\r\nmotion, that the West India interest took alarm, and desired to know\r\nwhether it was the intention of Government to adopt the measure. But Mr.\r\nPitt, who had not yet pledged the Administration to any step beyond that\r\nof inquiry, maintained a reserve on this point, which the enthusiasm of\r\nMr. Wilberforce may be said to have forced upon him. A letter from Sir\r\nWilliam Young touches on this matter; and alludes, also, to some\r\nunseemly conduct on the part of the Princes, which is spoken of in a\r\nsimilar spirit of deprecation in other letters. The circumstances that\r\nrendered their proceedings on this occasion the more conspicuous and\r\nobjectionable were, that the ball at White's Club, referred to, was\r\ngiven in honour of His Majesty's birthday, and happy restoration; and\r\nthat the Queen had signified her intention of being present.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR WILLIAM YOUNG TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Stratton Street, April 22nd, 1789.\r\n     MY DEAR LORD,\r\n\r\n     The week passed hath not afforded an item of information worthy the\r\n     sending you. I have now a circumstance or two to mention in the\r\n     political line, and a little scandal to garnish it with, of a sort\r\n     \"_quod predetendici potuisse, et non potuisse refelli_.\" Of\r\n     business in the first place. Steele told me yesterday, that on Mr.\r\n     Fox's motion this day to repeal the Hop-tax, it was meant to give\r\n     it up with the best grace possible. The next piece of Parliamentary\r\n     intelligence is respecting the Slave Trade; a committee from the\r\n     planters and merchants of the West Indies waited the other day on\r\n     Mr. Pitt, to put the short question, whether Government supported\r\n     Mr. Wilberforce in his motion for the _Abolition_ of the Slave\r\n     Trade? Mr. Pitt answered, that \"He must decline committing his own\r\n     opinion thus early, and that the Cabinet had not yet sat in\r\n     discussion of that question.\" The gentlemen of this committee speak\r\n     of Lord Hawkesbury as against the _extent_ of Mr. Wilberforce's\r\n     proposition, and that Administration are generally (Camden and\r\n     others) with Lord Hawkesbury. _Je ne m'en mele pas._\r\n\r\n     I know of no other business to engage the attention of Parliament\r\n     after Easter but my poor Bill, which is much amended and enlarged\r\n     from last year. It seems to have general support. I have thought it\r\n     more candid to read it a first time and print it, deferring the\r\n     second reading to the first week of meeting after Easter, when I am\r\n     engaged to the House to open fully the principle of my undertaking,\r\n     in what your Lordship terms _memoires raisonnees_. If I succeed in\r\n     this Bill, as I _expect_ to do, relating to the able poor, I shall,\r\n     next sessions, proceed to accomplish the rest of my plan, by\r\n     amending and giving force to (where necessary) the Bastard, Vagrant\r\n     Laws, and generally those of police respecting the poor. The plan\r\n     is extensive, but I have much considered it. I think I have it\r\n     clear in comprehension, and can pursue it through each effect on\r\n     the industry and manners of our people. I cannot be idle, _ainsi je\r\n     veux quelque part me faire ministre_.\r\n\r\n     For the dish of scandal I promised, it is of marked importance as\r\n     to the character of those whose character must have leading\r\n     consequences in this country; and, in fact, it is no scandal, it is\r\n     a shameful truth; otherwise, tales of this sort, are not such as I\r\n     like blotting my paper with. In the first place, on the ball given\r\n     by White's Club, at the Pantheon, the Prince of Wales sent round to\r\n     canvass _non_-attendance by every one of his party; yet both\r\n     himself and the Duke of York took the tickets sent, and then the\r\n     Duke of York sent them all to be sold, at Hookham's, to any one\r\n     that would buy them. The fact was intimated at White's, when the\r\n     stewards adopted a regulation to preclude the mischief of improper\r\n     company, by directing that the person subscribing, or to whom the\r\n     tickets were sent, should put his name. The Duke thereon _put his\r\n     name_, and the tickets were sold, with the prostitution of the\r\n     title of \"_York_.\" To close this disgraceful detail, a ball, the\r\n     same night, of ----, was given at the Horse Guards, expressly for\r\n     the Duke of York. I have not authentically heard whether the Prince\r\n     of Wales was of the party. The day will come when Englishmen will\r\n     bring these Princes to their senses.\r\n\r\n     Adieu, my dear Lord; health and prosperity, and success in all you\r\n     undertake, be yours; and to me, the happiness whilst I have life,\r\n     of signing, your affectionately devoted and obliged friend and\r\n     servant,\r\n\r\n     W. YOUNG.\r\n\r\nThe lamentable divisions that existed in the royal family formed a topic\r\nof common conversation, and deeply disturbed the tranquillity of His\r\nMajesty's mind. The Prince of Wales and the Duke of York took\r\nindustrious advantage of all available means to cultivate popularity out\r\nof doors; and when it was thought advisable by Ministers, that the King\r\nshould make a procession to St. Paul's to offer up thanks for his\r\nrecovery, their Royal Highnesses seem to have entered into a sort of\r\nrivalry with the King for the applause of the spectators. Indeed, there\r\nwas so little disguise about their personal conduct to His Majesty, that\r\nthe newspapers did not hesitate to charge them with it, and the Dukes of\r\nYork, Gloucester and Cumberland, felt it necessary to protect themselves\r\nagainst the animadversions of the Press, by prosecuting the publisher of\r\nthe \"Times,\" for accusing them of \"insincerity\" in their professions of\r\njoy at the King's recovery. Some fears were entertained as to the\r\nbearing of His Majesty on the occasion of the procession; but he passed\r\nthrough it with a composure and self-control that inspired his friends\r\nwith the utmost confidence in the future. Mr. Bernard, writing to Lord\r\nBuckingham on the 23rd of April, gives the following account of the\r\nproceedings:\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. BERNARD TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     London, April 23rd, 1789, Five o'clock, P.M.\r\n     MY LORD,\r\n\r\n     The ceremony of this day has been gone through exceedingly well.\r\n     The procession from the House of Commons began at eight o'clock,\r\n     and the King reached St. Paul's between eleven and twelve. The\r\n     arrangement of the cathedral, particularly the dome, presented a\r\n     beautiful sight. The King seems much reduced by his late\r\n     illness--was remarkably composed during the service, and attentive\r\n     to the music. His Majesty, as well as the Queen, seemed much\r\n     affected with the solemnity of their first entrance, as were many\r\n     of the persons present. Lady Uxbridge was near fainting away.\r\n\r\n     As the King went out of the church, he seemed to be in good\r\n     spirits, and talked much to the persons about him; but he stared\r\n     and laughed less than ever I knew him on a public occasion. He\r\n     returned to the Queen's House between three and four o'clock. Mr.\r\n     Fox and most of his party were there. He and Colonel Fitzpatrick\r\n     were stationed in front of the altar, and directly opposite the\r\n     King, being the part of the cathedral for Privy Councillors and\r\n     Peers' sons. Mr. Pitt sat near them, but not in the first ranks. I\r\n     saw Lord Temple in a very good place, in that part of the church. I\r\n     did not see Mr. Burke there, and therefore suppose he continues\r\n     ill. The trial was deferred yesterday on account of his illness,\r\n     which people say was occasioned by his working himself into too\r\n     great a passion the day before.\r\n\r\n     I have the honour to be ever, my Lord,\r\n     Your Excellency's most faithful and affectionate servant,\r\n     S. BERNARD.\r\n\r\nThe same subject is followed up in a letter from Lord Bulkeley.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD BULKELEY TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Stanhope Street, April 27th, 1789.\r\n     MY DEAR LORD,\r\n\r\n     The pilgrimage to St. Paul's, which funck'd us all very much, has\r\n     turned out exceedingly well, for the King conducted himself\r\n     throughout the whole of that very arduous trial in such a manner as\r\n     to convince all, except those who will not see nor hear, that he is\r\n     in perfect possession of his faculties. The Princes of Wales, York,\r\n     Cumberland, and, I am sorry to say, Gloucester, talked to each\r\n     other the whole time of the service, and behaved in such an\r\n     indecent manner that was quite shocking. The King in Pall Mall was\r\n     received without applause, and the Prince with a good deal; but\r\n     from Cockspur Street to St. Paul's he had the warmest acclamations\r\n     possible, particularly in the city of London, where all ranks of\r\n     people were unanimous, which the King perceived, and since has much\r\n     praised. In parts of the Strand the Prince's dependants were posted\r\n     to give him an huzza as he passed, which flattered him most\r\n     exceedingly; but he lost his temper in the City, and he never\r\n     recovered it afterwards, for at St. Paul's he was in the worst\r\n     humour possible, and did everything he could do to expose himself\r\n     in the face of an amazing concourse of persons, and of all the\r\n     foreign Ministers.\r\n\r\n     On the return of the procession the Prince and Duke of York put on\r\n     their uniforms at Carlton House, and headed the whole brigade of\r\n     Grenadiers, and fired a _feu de joie_ before Buckingham House, the\r\n     King and Queen and the Princesses standing in one of the windows.\r\n     The Prince, before the King got into his carriage, which the whole\r\n     line waited for before they filed off, went off on a sudden with\r\n     one hundred of the common people, with Mr. Wattie in the middle of\r\n     them, huzzaing him, and was done evidently to lead, if possible, a\r\n     greater number, and to make it penetrate into Buckingham House.\r\n\r\n     The breach is so very wide between the King and Prince, that it\r\n     seems to me to be a great weakness to allow him any communication\r\n     with him whatsoever; for under the mask of attention to their\r\n     father and mother, the Prince and Duke of York commit every\r\n     possible outrage, and show every insult they can devise to them.\r\n     The report of the journey to Hanover prevails to an alarming\r\n     degree, and the King talks of it right hand and left; but it is to\r\n     be hoped the Ministers will be able to divert his attention from it\r\n     at this particular moment, for in the present unhinged state of\r\n     things it might be pregnant with very disagreeable consequences. I\r\n     believe the King's mind is torn to pieces by his sons, and that he\r\n     expects to relieve himself by a new scene, and by getting out of\r\n     the way of hearing of and seeing the Prince of Wales, with the\r\n     hopes of being able to detach the Duke of York, whom he fondly and\r\n     dotingly loves, and of prevailing on him to marry on the continent,\r\n     of which there is no chance, for in my opinion he is just as bad as\r\n     the Prince, and gives no hopes of any change or amendment\r\n     whatsoever in thought, word, or deed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     P.S.--It is said that the King abuses Dundas to those about him\r\n     very much, in a language that is very much copied by those whom we\r\n     all know by the term of \"King's friends;\" and there are some who\r\n     pretend to say that his loss of ground at Buckingham House has been\r\n     owing to the part he took against Hastings, in which he has the\r\n     reputation of having engaged Pitt to concur. I have made every\r\n     inquiry whether the King ever expresses himself to his people about\r\n     him in favour of Hastings, and I am told he is very guarded and\r\n     reserved on his subject, but that some _females_ in his house talk\r\n     loud and warmly in his favour, which occasions the attributing the\r\n     same opinions to him.\r\n\r\n     On one of the adjourned questions on Hastings's trial in the House\r\n     of Lords, Lord Maitland, standing next to Dundas, asked him what he\r\n     thought would be the result of the inquiry, to which he replied in\r\n     these words: \"I don't care what is done with him, for you and your\r\n     friends in Opposition have done our business, by keeping him out of\r\n     the Board of Control.\" Lord Maitland on this called up Colonel\r\n     Fitzpatrick and Dudley Long, in whose presence Dundas actually\r\n     repeated his words, and they, of course, trumpeted them all over\r\n     town, and they have occasioned much conversation and much abuse of\r\n     Dundas, in addition to their former abuse on the part of Hastings's\r\n     friends. The folly of such language, especially to three violent\r\n     Oppositionists, was very absurd, weak, and ill-judged, but the fact\r\n     is certain.\r\n\r\n     I hear many complaints of Pitt and his Secretaries' personal\r\n     inattentions to Members _of_ Parliament, but they will think twenty\r\n     times before they go into Opposition; and it is most probable that\r\n     these complaints are not made till _impossible jobs_ have been\r\n     refused; I therefore only mention them as certainly existing, and\r\n     most probably as to any consequences, _vox et praeterea nihil_, at\r\n     least till the last sessions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     Just as I was sealing my letter a person called on me, who tells\r\n     me that divisions in the Cabinet, or rather among the Cabinet\r\n     Ministers, certainly do exist, to a great degree, about Mr. Dundas,\r\n     and has confirmed to me what I have before told you, that every\r\n     corner of Buckingham House resounds with abuse, and opprobrious\r\n     epithets against him.\r\n\r\nA passage in a letter of Mr. Grenville's, dated the 2nd of May,\r\nindicates an approaching event, to which many circumstances, but chiefly\r\nthe increasing weight the writer had latterly acquired in the councils\r\nof Mr. Pitt, had for some time been obviously tending.\r\n\r\n     I wish to mention to you that Lord S. has taken great offence, from\r\n     the circumstance of having at last found out that your despatches\r\n     to him come over enclosed to me. I could wish, therefore, that for\r\n     the _very short time_ that your correspondence with him is likely\r\n     to continue you would alter this, as nothing material is likely to\r\n     arise that can render it necessary, and I am desirous just at this\r\n     particular moment to avoid any altercation with him. This jealousy\r\n     on his part, and a just sense on mine of his conduct towards you,\r\n     has entirely broke off all communication between us with respect to\r\n     Irish, or indeed any other, business. Some delay and awkwardness\r\n     necessarily arises from this; but it is unavoidable, and I repeat\r\n     that it will probably be of _very_ short duration.\r\n\r\nThe nomination of Mr. Grenville to the Home Office had been delayed only\r\ntill the arrangements consequent upon the necessary changes it involved\r\ncould be satisfactorily carried out. The means of effecting it were now\r\nwithin Mr. Pitt's reach; and at the moment this letter was written, Mr.\r\nGrenville's appointment was on the eve of being ratified.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Whitehall, May 15th, 1789.\r\n     MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     Just as I was sitting down to write to you, I received a note from\r\n     Hobart, informing me of his arrival. I have seen him, and had a\r\n     long conversation on the different points which he is charged with.\r\n     My appointment is, I think I may now _decisively_ say, fixed for\r\n     Friday next, and I hope that you will soon feel the effects of your\r\n     new correspondent, in the expedition of the various matters which\r\n     are now lying on hand. You must, I am sure, be sensible that under\r\n     the circumstances of these last three weeks, it has been _quite\r\n     impossible_ for me, however ardently I wished it for your sake, to\r\n     bring forward these different points of business; but on Monday\r\n     sev'nnight, at latest, I hope to write to you upon them all, though\r\n     the length of Hobart's memorandum-paper has a little frightened me.\r\n     I do not complain of it as thinking your bill a large one,\r\n     considering the value received, but only I think the impression of\r\n     my _debut_ in the closet may be a little awkward. I must, however,\r\n     meet this as well as I can; and although this ten days' more delay\r\n     must, I know, be very unpleasant to you, I trust you will see it is\r\n     unavoidable.\r\n\r\n     If you find it necessary, for reconciling any of your principal\r\n     people to the delay, to assign the intended change in the\r\n     Secretary's office as a reason, there can now be no objection to\r\n     it, as we have agreed that it would be right that, by the time you\r\n     can receive this letter, we should begin to buzz it about, as a\r\n     thing not improbable to happen.\r\n\r\n     With respect, however, to your peerages, I have, as I promised you,\r\n     got Pitt to state them to the King, who has consented to them,\r\n     Marquisates and all. You may now, therefore, recommend them as soon\r\n     as you please, and _I_ will take care there shall be no further\r\n     unnecessary delay.\r\n\r\n     There are, however, still two points with respect to this business.\r\n     I understand from Hobart that Lord Glerawley wants his promotion to\r\n     be limited to his brother. This had not been stated in your\r\n     letters, and I was therefore unable to mention it to Pitt. It is\r\n     therefore still possible that the King may make some objection to\r\n     this, as you know it is against one of his rules (though by no\r\n     means an invariable one) to give a step and a limitation at the\r\n     same time.\r\n\r\n     The other is essential, and can, I hope, make no difficulty with\r\n     you. He is willing to _engage_ that these should _all_ be done\r\n     without delay, but he seems much to wish that the promotions and\r\n     creations should be separated, in order that they may not, by\r\n     coming together, appear to fill too large a column in the\r\n     \"Gazette.\" There must, therefore, be an interval of a fortnight or\r\n     three weeks. You will judge whether the promotions or creations\r\n     should come first.\r\n\r\n     The only remaining point is that of the Seals. I beg you to believe\r\n     me sincere when I assure you that, independent of your wishes upon\r\n     the subject, my own opinion is quite as much made up as yours is on\r\n     the subject of Fitzgibbon's appointment. But, in the same\r\n     sincerity, I assure you that it is by no means advantageous towards\r\n     the attainment of this object, that it should be pressed forward in\r\n     the present moment. Hobart has asked me whether Fitzgibbon's coming\r\n     over would not be of use to him? I am strongly inclined to be of\r\n     opinion that it would; but before I gave him a decisive answer, I\r\n     wish to consult Pitt, and he is not to write to Fitzgibbon till\r\n     after that. With respect to the difficulty of your Chancery causes,\r\n     I can conceive no earthly reason why Carleton, especially as he is\r\n     to receive so great a favour, should not have to go on with them,\r\n     just as Lord Loughborough did here when the Seals were in\r\n     commission for a year. Depend upon it that I do not deceive you,\r\n     when I say that it is much better to wait for the favourable\r\n     moment, than to hurry it on to a decision now. That favourable\r\n     moment may arise sooner or later, but I am confident that\r\n     ultimately _le bon tems viendra_. Your information about the\r\n     Chancellor's _resolution_ is very curious, because I have reason to\r\n     _know_ that McNa. is exactly the very person who has most strongly\r\n     urged Thurlow on the propriety of an English appointment, and who\r\n     has suggested this curious notion of F.'s unpopularity. But I\r\n     mention this, relying upon your honour that you will not repeat it\r\n     to _any one_, but particularly not to Fitzgibbon.\r\n\r\n     I am most sincerely sorry that the consideration of your health\r\n     should enter at all into the question of your going or remaining.\r\n     Pray let me entreat you, whether you take the one resolution or the\r\n     other ultimately, not to delay nor put off one day a fixed\r\n     resolution to use constant and sufficient exercise. I am sure any\r\n     delay on that head is of a hundred times more consequence than all\r\n     those which we have been lamenting. Nothing in the world could make\r\n     up to you for the consequences which your omission in this respect\r\n     (which I am grieved to learn from Hobart still continues) may bring\r\n     upon you. You cannot conceive how earnestly I feel on this subject,\r\n     because I am every day feeling the good effects of a contrary\r\n     practice, which enables me to go through all the business I have,\r\n     without hurting my health or spirits.\r\n\r\n     Adieu, my dear brother,\r\n     Believe me ever most affectionately yours,\r\n     W. W. G.\r\n\r\nThe duel between Colonel Lenox and the Duke of York took place on the\r\n26th of May. The town gossiped about it, but regarded it with\r\nindifference; and neither party got much credit in the end. Mr. Hobart,\r\non the 30th, communicates another _on dit_ concerning the behaviour of\r\nthe Princes.\r\n\r\n     The Queen and Princesses were last night at the _fete_ given by the\r\n     French Ambassador. The Prince of Wales, Dukes of York and Clarence,\r\n     were also there; but would not dance, or stay supper, lest they\r\n     should have the appearance of paying the smallest attention to Her\r\n     Majesty. The officers of the Duke of York's regiment met yesterday,\r\n     at the request of Charles Lenox; they did not come to a decision\r\n     till about an hour ago. I hear it is that Lenox acted with courage,\r\n     but not with judgment.\r\n\r\nThere was some difficulty in finding a successor for Mr. Grenville in\r\nthe House of Commons. The choice at last fell on Mr. Addington. The\r\nselection was not altogether unexceptionable; but, upon the whole, he\r\nwas the best person that could be found.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Whitehall, June 1st, 1789.\r\n     MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     I have this morning received your two letters, of the 26th and 28th\r\n     together, which was a great relief to me from the uneasiness which\r\n     I should have felt from your first letter, if I had received it\r\n     separately. I most sincerely hope that you will feel no further bad\r\n     effects from this accident. Lady B. has been some days on her road\r\n     to Dublin, and is probably with you before this time. I cannot\r\n     express to you how much I am concerned that any parts of my letter\r\n     on the subject of the promotions should have appeared to you in the\r\n     smallest degree wanting in that kindness and warmth of affection\r\n     which I so sincerely feel, and always wish and mean to express. I\r\n     have no copy of that letter, nor have I any recollection of the\r\n     particular turn or expression of it which can at all serve me to\r\n     remember what part of it can have impressed your mind with this\r\n     sensation. I can therefore only say that, whatever it was, it has\r\n     been most remote from my intention, and that as to any expression\r\n     which can bear such an interpretation--_totum hoc indictum volo_.\r\n\r\n     With respect to the King's health, on which you ask me so\r\n     particularly, I can only repeat to you what I said in my last\r\n     letter--which I have from what I believe to be the very best\r\n     authority--that he continues perfectly well, both in mind and body,\r\n     and, with respect to the latter, is growing stronger every day. I\r\n     beg you to believe, that though I should write you any contrary\r\n     account with much pain and mortification, yet that I feel too much\r\n     the importance of your being well and accurately informed on the\r\n     subject, to have a moment's hesitation in stating anything of that\r\n     sort to you as soon as I heard it myself. But, in truth, I believe\r\n     that all these reports originate in nothing else than the anxiety\r\n     of the King's friends for the preservation of his health, and the\r\n     impatience which his enemies feel for the only event which can give\r\n     them any prospect of seeing their wishes accomplished.\r\n\r\n     Addington is the person intended for my successor. He wants only a\r\n     little more age, and being a little more known, to make his\r\n     nomination unexceptionable; but I certainly cannot but confess that\r\n     he does want both these. It is, however, the best appointment that\r\n     we can make to a situation to which so few people are willing to\r\n     look, and for which so much fewer are at all qualified. I have no\r\n     doubt of his acquitting himself well in it, and of his becoming, in\r\n     a little time, extremely popular in the House. We shall certainly\r\n     lose our Abolition question. The cry against us upon it is growing\r\n     every day stronger, without anybody being willing to give\r\n     themselves the trouble of entering, in the smallest degree, into\r\n     the examination of the grounds upon which our arguments rest.\r\n\r\n     We have no foreign news, except the continuance of the disputes and\r\n     difficulties in France. But these you have as fully in the\r\n     newspapers as I could detail them to you. The accounts from Vienna\r\n     seem to agree that there is not much probability of the Emperor's\r\n     finally recovering these repeated attacks, though he may linger out\r\n     a considerable time.\r\n\r\n     Adieu, my dear brother,\r\n     And believe me ever most sincerely and affectionately yours,\r\n     W. W. G.\r\n\r\nLord Buckingham's health had suffered so much from the toils and\r\nanxieties to which he had been exposed during the last few months, that\r\nhis physicians urged upon him the necessity of trying the waters at\r\nBath. So long as the exigencies of the public service made an imperative\r\ndemand on his energies, he bore his labours with unshrinking resolution;\r\nbut now that the contest was over, and the security and influence of the\r\nGovernment were restored, he felt the recoil severely. It was natural\r\nthat there should be mixed with this hope of recruiting his strength by\r\nchange of scene, a strong desire for repose. The stormy times he had\r\nfallen upon in Ireland rendered his position there onerous and\r\noppressive. He had ridden the storm in safety, and had the satisfaction\r\nof feeling that, whenever he retired from the Government, he would leave\r\nto his successor, untrammelled by the associations and recollections of\r\nthe past, a comparatively easy task.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     (Private.)        Whitehall, June 13th, 1789.\r\n     MY DEAREST BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     You will receive with this the official notification of\r\n     Fitzgibbon's appointment to the Seals, which I send with the more\r\n     pleasure at this particular moment, because I know that it will\r\n     relieve your mind from one of the points on which you have felt a\r\n     peculiar degree of anxiety. The decision on this point gives me\r\n     great satisfaction, on many accounts, as an act of justice towards\r\n     him, and as an example both to our friends and our enemies; but the\r\n     interest which you took in it makes the event infinitely more\r\n     agreeable to me than it would otherwise have been, however much I\r\n     am convinced that it was right and necessary.\r\n\r\n     The particular occasion, however, of my writing this letter, was\r\n     not so much the conclusion of this business, as something which\r\n     relates to another, more nearly concerning yourself. In consequence\r\n     of your letter, and of the alarm which I have since had on your\r\n     account, I thought it very material that the idea of your going to\r\n     Bath should be opened to the King, in order to ascertain how far it\r\n     was practicable for you to avail yourself of this, which I am\r\n     persuaded will be the best of all remedies for you, without, at the\r\n     same time, giving up the idea of returning to Ireland, if you\r\n     should feel yourself desirous of it. I accordingly took to-day the\r\n     first opportunity which I have had, of mentioning this to the King,\r\n     and I have great pleasure in saying, that he not only acquiesced in\r\n     the idea, but that he lent himself to it with the greatest\r\n     readiness, and seemed desirous that you should not omit this if it\r\n     could be useful to you. If, therefore, on consultation with Austin,\r\n     you should find that a journey to Bath will be of service to you,\r\n     there remains nothing for you to do, but to write an official\r\n     letter \"requesting the King's permission to be absent from Ireland\r\n     for a limited time, in order that you may go to Bath for the\r\n     recovery of your health,\" and I shall be able to return you an\r\n     answer, signifying the King's consent, before your preparations for\r\n     your journey can be made. If, after some residence at Bath, you\r\n     should find your health and spirits not equal to the returning, you\r\n     will be better enabled then to decide upon that point, and it will\r\n     be perfectly easy for you then to state this, and to resign on the\r\n     ground of the injury which the King's service would sustain from\r\n     any longer absence. But I am sure I need not mention to you, who\r\n     are so well acquainted with that country, the absolute and\r\n     indispensable _necessity_ of your doing everything (in the event of\r\n     your going to Bath) which may give the _strongest impression_ of\r\n     your _determination_ to return. If this is not done, you must feel\r\n     that the Government will be thrown loose, and that the mischief of\r\n     such an interval may be such as to be irretrievable. If, on the\r\n     contrary, this persuasion prevails, I see no fear of inconvenience\r\n     from your absence on this account.\r\n\r\n     I enclose to you, under a flying seal, a letter of congratulation\r\n     and compliment to Fitzgibbon, which expresses no more than I really\r\n     feel on that subject. Adieu, my dear brother.\r\n\r\n     Believe me ever most affectionately yours,\r\n     W. W. G.\r\n\r\n     P.S.--You will, of course, immediately recommend Fitzgibbon for a\r\n     Barony; but if you can dissuade him from it, pray do not let him\r\n     take the title of Limerick, actually possessed by Lord Clanbrassil.\r\n     The instance of Earl of Buckingham_shire_ (so created) and Marquis\r\n     of B. by no means applies, and it would look invidious.\r\n\r\nLord Buckingham's resolution to relinquish the Government of Ireland was\r\nnow finally taken. He communicated his intentions, in the first\r\ninstance, in a private letter to Mr. Grenville, to which the following\r\nis the reply.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Wimbledon, Sept. 14th, 1789.\r\n     MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     I received your letter of the 6th respecting your resignation, and\r\n     your subsequent letters of the 10th and 11th. You are too much\r\n     aware of the extreme difficulty of finding persons willing and\r\n     qualified to undertake the office which you are quitting, not to\r\n     expect some little delay before we can say anything to you\r\n     respecting the choice itself, or the mode or exact period of your\r\n     resignation; though I certainly agree with you, that, if you have\r\n     entirely abandoned the idea of returning, the formal notification\r\n     of that intention ought not to be long delayed. It certainly would\r\n     have been a satisfaction to me, both on public and private grounds,\r\n     if the state of your health would have admitted of your completing\r\n     your triumph even more decidedly than you have already done, though\r\n     I trust that is sufficient.\r\n\r\n     The finding a proper person to replace you is, indeed, no easy\r\n     task; because, although I am entirely of your opinion, that by\r\n     proper management, the situation of English Government in Ireland\r\n     is secure; yet, on the other hand, I cannot but feel how very\r\n     little mismanagement would throw us back again, and how much more\r\n     the crisis seems to demand, than is, I fear, to be found in any of\r\n     the persons who may probably be to look to that situation. It will\r\n     certainly be my wish on many accounts, that the change of the\r\n     Lord-Lieutenant should not affect Hobart's situation.\r\n\r\n     I have not yet seen him, as I have not been in town for this last\r\n     week; but if he is come, I suppose I shall either to-day or\r\n     to-morrow.\r\n\r\n     The question about Lord Loftus can, I think, end no otherwise than\r\n     as Hobart proposes. I shall, however, not say or write anything on\r\n     the subject to the King till I have seen Hobart. I have no\r\n     difficulty in conversing with him quite freely about his own\r\n     situation, as when I saw him in town last, I told him very fairly\r\n     what my wishes would be in the event of your quitting the\r\n     Government; but, at the same time, told him as fairly, that nothing\r\n     could be decisively fixed on that subject till your successor was\r\n     appointed, and his wishes consulted.\r\n\r\n     I enclose you a letter from Lord Clonmel, which was transmitted to\r\n     me with one which I also send you a copy of. I shall merely write\r\n     an answer acknowledging the receipt, and saying, that agreeably to\r\n     his desire, I have transmitted it to you.\r\n\r\n     I heartily wish, that the distance of Teignmouth was not such as to\r\n     put all idea of our meeting there entirely out of the question;\r\n     especially as Nepean's being ill makes it still more impossible for\r\n     me to leave this neighbourhood.\r\n\r\n     We have no sort of news. The French Assembly is going on with\r\n     endless disputes about their Constitution; but one ought to be much\r\n     more interested than I feel myself in the event of these disputes,\r\n     not to be heartily tired of hearing of them. The main point appears\r\n     quite secure, that they will not for many years be in a situation\r\n     to molest the invaluable peace which we now enjoy.\r\n\r\n     Ever most affectionately yours,\r\n     W. W. G.\r\n\r\n     P.S.--I had almost forgot to mention, that on hearing of the\r\n     contest for Cornwall, and being informed that no time was to be\r\n     lost, I took upon me to desire Camplin to write to Dale to exert\r\n     himself in favour of Gregor, our candidate, having every reason to\r\n     believe that you would have no other wish on the subject, than that\r\n     of helping to keep out an enemy.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Holwood, Sept. 25th, 1789.\r\n     MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     I have not yet sent to the King your letter of resignation. Pitt\r\n     has, however, explained to him that you have notified to us the\r\n     impossibility of your returning, and that you have only delayed the\r\n     formal resignation till His Majesty shall have considered of the\r\n     arrangement to be made for that Government. This point is not yet\r\n     decided. It is indeed one of most extreme difficulty.\r\n\r\n     In consequence of Cooke's letter to Hobart, which the latter showed\r\n     me, I mentioned to the King your intended recommendation of Lord\r\n     L., explaining to him at the same time that you clearly understood\r\n     yourself not to have made any such engagement, but that as a\r\n     contrary interpretation was put upon it by Lord C., through whom\r\n     the transaction passed, it seemed for the benefit of His Majesty's\r\n     service that this step should be recommended. I also stated that\r\n     this would necessarily bring with it _the two others_ and perhaps a\r\n     third, which I named to him at Hobart's desire. He acquiesced in\r\n     the whole of this without difficulty.\r\n\r\n     Adieu, my dearest brother.\r\n     Ever most affectionately yours,\r\n     W. W. G.\r\n\r\n     There has been an action off the coast of Finland, between what are\r\n     called the Swedish and Russian _army fleets_. The Russians appear\r\n     to have had the victory decisively, but to be so disabled by it as\r\n     to be quite unable to do anything more with that fleet this year.\r\n     Nothing new from France.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th of September, Lord Buckingham formally resigned. His\r\nsuccessor, however, was not yet decided upon, and the subject occasioned\r\nmuch perplexity in the Cabinet. The Lieutenancy was offered to the Duke\r\nof Beaufort, who declined. The next person thought of was the Earl of\r\nWestmoreland, who accepted. \"There are several points,\" observes Mr.\r\nGrenville, \"in which Westmoreland would do perfectly: there are those in\r\nwhich he fails; but God knows the list to choose out of is not long.\"\r\n\r\nThe letter containing this intelligence announced also the death of the\r\nDuke of Chandos, who held the office of Lord Steward, with an\r\nintimation that it was probable the new Lord Steward would be the Duke\r\nof Dorset. Upon receipt of this information, Lord Buckingham wrote to\r\nMr. Grenville, expressing his desire to be appointed to the vacancy, and\r\nurging also his claims upon promotion in the peerage. He felt strongly\r\nupon this point. The personal obloquy and factious resistance he had\r\nencountered and triumphed over in his Government, appeared to him to\r\ndemand some distinct and special mark of His Majesty's favour and\r\napprobation; and as this was the mode most likely to make that\r\nimpression upon the public mind in Ireland which the dignity of the\r\nCrown, and his own justification in the policy he had pursued,\r\nemphatically called for, the feelings that were awakened throughout the\r\ncourse of the following painful correspondence may be readily conceived.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Holwood, Oct. 5th, 1789.\r\n     MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     Your messenger brought me here, yesterday evening, your letter of\r\n     the 3rd instant; but I have deferred answering it till this\r\n     morning, because I wished for a little time to turn the subject of\r\n     it over in my own mind, and particularly to consider whether I\r\n     should communicate it to Pitt. After some deliberation with myself,\r\n     I have resolved not to make this communication, because I consider\r\n     the Lord Steward's staff as being, in fact, disposed of; and I\r\n     feel, on that account, an unwillingness to state, even to Pitt,\r\n     that you had entertained a wish to succeed to that office. I am\r\n     sure I need not say, that if this idea had ever come across my\r\n     mind, I should have given you the earliest intelligence in my power\r\n     of the death of the Duke of Chandos; and should have endeavoured to\r\n     prevent any steps being taken for filling up his office, till I\r\n     had heard from you. As it is, you will already have heard from me,\r\n     that our intention was to offer it to the Duke of Dorset; there not\r\n     being the smallest ground to imagine that the Duke of Leeds wishes\r\n     to quit his present situation. This offer was accordingly made two\r\n     days ago; and the Duke of Dorset has all but accepted it, desiring\r\n     only to have five minutes previous conversation with Pitt. He is to\r\n     come here for that purpose this morning; and I have no doubt, from\r\n     the turn of his letter, that he intends to accept. Under these\r\n     circumstances, you will, I am sure, approve of my saying nothing to\r\n     Pitt on that part of your letter; nor do I feel it necessary to\r\n     state to you all that would otherwise occur to me upon it as matter\r\n     for your consideration. * * *\r\n\r\n     Ever most sincerely and affectionately yours,\r\n     W. W. G.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Whitehall, Oct. 6th, 1789.\r\n     MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     The D. of D. has, as I imagined he would, accepted without\r\n     hesitation. His wish to see Mr. Pitt appears to have been only for\r\n     the purpose of stating his situation and feelings with regard to\r\n     the French Embassy. The D. of B. has refused. We shall have W.'s\r\n     answer to-morrow.\r\n\r\n     I send you no French news, for in fact we get none that is not more\r\n     fully detailed in the papers.\r\n\r\n     Ever, my dear brother,\r\n     Most affectionately yours,\r\n     W. W. G.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Whitehall, Nov. 2nd, 1789.\r\n     MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     I saw Mr. Pitt on Saturday evening, and explained your wishes to\r\n     him. He has undertaken to mention the subject to the King on\r\n     _Thursday_ (as he does not return to town till Wednesday evening),\r\n     and to second it with all the eloquence of which he is possessed.\r\n     He expressed himself with real friendship and zeal upon the\r\n     subject; though, I am sorry to say, he appears to entertain the\r\n     same apprehensions with myself as to the result. I am, however,\r\n     persuaded that this opinion will not lessen his exertions for a\r\n     more favourable answer, if it can be obtained. He thought it better\r\n     to mention to the King, at the same time, the idea respecting the\r\n     Duke of Grafton; though he seems to think it doubtful whether the\r\n     Post-office will afford the means of that arrangement.\r\n\r\n     We have no news from France; the express, which generally comes on\r\n     Sunday, not being yet arrived.\r\n\r\n     The insurrection has broke out in Austrian Flanders; but in a\r\n     manner which seems little likely to be successful. Our accounts\r\n     from thence are, however, very imperfect.\r\n\r\n     Ever most affectionately yours,\r\n     W. W. G.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     St. James's Square, Nov. 6th, 1789.\r\n     MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     The drawing-room was so very late yesterday, that it was impossible\r\n     for Pitt to go into the closet afterwards, as it was not over till\r\n     past five, and the King had to go back to Windsor. This being the\r\n     case, we have agreed that, in order to prevent any further delay,\r\n     Pitt shall write to the King upon the subject, stating all the\r\n     arguments upon it, and at the same time reserving a ground for\r\n     speaking to the King upon it at the next levee, if it should be\r\n     necessary. I own I am by no means sorry that the circumstance of\r\n     the lateness of the drawing-room, has given a plea for having\r\n     recourse to this mode, as I have always observed it to succeed best\r\n     with the King. There are many things which can be much more\r\n     strongly put in a letter than in conversation with him, especially\r\n     on any subject on which he is unwilling to converse; and all the\r\n     points of this particular business may be more forcibly urged by\r\n     being collected and stated with a reference to each other, in a\r\n     manner which the King's desultory way of speaking makes almost\r\n     impossible. I am persuaded, therefore, that whatever the chance is\r\n     of success in this business, it is greater in this mode; especially\r\n     as Pitt will still have to mention it to him on Wednesday, if his\r\n     written answer is not favourable.\r\n\r\n     I would write to you oftener, or desire Bernard to do it when I\r\n     cannot, on the French and Flemish news, but that I really find the\r\n     papers are every morning just as good intelligencers as I could be.\r\n     They will even tell you all that I can about the Duke of Orleans'\r\n     mission, which is evidently only a pretence for leaving Paris, as\r\n     he has not even affected to talk to the King, or his Ministers,\r\n     about any business, except to ask, in general terms, what is\r\n     thought of the state of the Low Countries? to which you may suppose\r\n     the answer would be quite as general, even supposing that we had\r\n     anything more particular to say, which we have not.\r\n\r\n     What the motive was for his leaving Paris, I know no more than by\r\n     the general report which circulates there as well as here, of his\r\n     having been detected in plans against the small remains of the\r\n     King's authority.\r\n\r\n     Ever most affectionately yours,\r\n     W. W. G.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     St. James's Square, Nov. 7th, 1789.\r\n     MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     I am persuaded it is unnecessary for me to say how sincerely sorry\r\n     I am to be obliged to acquaint you that the King's answer to Pitt's\r\n     letter of yesterday is such as to give, I am afraid, very little\r\n     hope indeed of success in the business to which it relates. The\r\n     King says, however, in it, that in compliance with Pitt's request\r\n     he defers giving a final answer till he sees him on Wednesday, so\r\n     that we cannot consider the subject as closed till then; but I\r\n     fairly own to you that I think there is now very little ground for\r\n     expecting a favourable result. The King does not enter into the\r\n     subject at all in his answer, but only refers to what has formerly\r\n     passed upon it.\r\n\r\n     I heartily wish that I was the channel of more pleasing\r\n     intelligence, and this the more, because though I certainly do not\r\n     see this point exactly in the light in which you seemed to consider\r\n     it when we conversed upon it, yet the success of it would have\r\n     afforded me real satisfaction, independent even of the\r\n     gratification of your wishes.\r\n\r\n     Believe me ever, my dear brother,\r\n     Most affectionately yours,\r\n     W. W. G.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     St. James's Square, Nov. 9th, 1789.\r\n     MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     I received this morning your letter, acquainting me with your\r\n     determination, in the event of the King's answer on Wednesday being\r\n     such as there is certainly every reason to believe it will be. You\r\n     announce this as a determination in some measure taken in your own\r\n     mind, and on which you do not appear to wish for my advice; and\r\n     there are perhaps too many circumstances which must make such a\r\n     step painful to me, to allow me to be a competent adviser on such a\r\n     subject. I must therefore confine myself to expressing my very\r\n     great and sincere concern both in the cause and the effect.\r\n\r\n     Your letter does not express whether any and what part of it should\r\n     be communicated to Pitt. Perhaps you will think it right that he\r\n     should have some previous knowledge of your resolution, if such it\r\n     is, before he sees the King, but this is a point of infinitely too\r\n     much delicacy for me to take upon myself to decide; and I also\r\n     confess that the task of communicating it would be to my feelings\r\n     so extremely painful, that I should be particularly desirous to\r\n     avoid it.\r\n\r\n     I have only to add my strong sense of the kindness of your\r\n     expressions and wishes towards me. I hope I have deserved your\r\n     affection, I am sure I have endeavoured to do so; and this\r\n     business, unhappy as it is, would be a thousand times more so to\r\n     me, if I could think it possible. I trust in God that it is not so,\r\n     that any event of it could produce the smallest diminution of that\r\n     mutual affection and confidence which has now so long subsisted\r\n     between us, and to which I have felt, and shall ever feel, that I\r\n     owe more than to any other circumstance of my life. In these\r\n     sentiments,\r\n\r\n     Believe me ever, my dear brother,\r\n     Most truly and affectionately yours,\r\n     W. W. G.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     St. James's Square, Nov. 12th, 1789.\r\n     MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     As I understand from Pitt that he means to write to you to-day in\r\n     answer to your letter, I have nothing to add to the account which\r\n     he will give you of the unfavourable result of his conversation of\r\n     yesterday. He mentioned to me an idea which he had of contriving to\r\n     see you if possible before you took the step of resigning the\r\n     Lieutenancy of the county. Perhaps if he comes down to Stowe for\r\n     that purpose, it would be more agreeable to you that I should\r\n     accompany him, and in that case I would certainly contrive to do\r\n     so. Otherwise, I feel that you are already so fully in possession\r\n     of all that I think and feel on this painful subject, that I could\r\n     not wish to give you the labour of a journey to Missenden for the\r\n     purpose of a conversation, which could only be a repetition of what\r\n     I have already said and written. I have turned the whole question\r\n     over and over again in my mind, and the result is the same with\r\n     what I have already stated to you, and is founded on the same\r\n     feeling: that though the object is a natural one for you to have\r\n     looked to, I cannot think that the King's refusal does, in any\r\n     manner, call upon you for that line of conduct which you can be\r\n     disposed to adopt only in the belief that you _are_ called upon so\r\n     to do. It is unnecessary for me to enlarge again on the grounds of\r\n     this opinion; but in stating it, I give you my sincere and honest\r\n     sentiments, freed, as far as I can free them, from the bias which\r\n     they are necessarily liable to, on account of the painful\r\n     impression which is made on my mind by the idea of the smallest\r\n     difference in our political line.\r\n\r\n     I cannot conclude this letter without again expressing to you the\r\n     heartfelt satisfaction which I derive, under these circumstances,\r\n     from the sense which you entertain and express of my sincere and\r\n     zealous affection.\r\n\r\n     Ever yours,\r\n     W. W. G.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     St. James's Square, Nov. 28th, 1789.\r\n     MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     I have just received your letter. Things remain hitherto on the\r\n     same footing, with every appearance of doing well. All depends,\r\n     however, on the ultimate arrangement of the point referred. I own I\r\n     am inclined to hope better things than you seem to do. Real\r\n     friendship and connection is, I agree with you, not to be hoped\r\n     for; but if public appearances are preserved, and public support\r\n     effectually, even though not cordially, given, all is obtained that\r\n     is in any degree necessary for public objects; and the present\r\n     disposition does, as far as I can judge, go the whole length of\r\n     what I have now stated. It is by no means a difficult or new\r\n     situation for people to act together in public business without the\r\n     bond of private connection and friendship. It is indeed very rare,\r\n     I believe; and what I consider as a most singular and peculiar\r\n     happiness, that the contrary should exist to the degree to which it\r\n     does, and it would, I am afraid, be much too sanguine to entertain\r\n     hopes that this should be extended to the case now in question. I\r\n     will not fail to let you know as soon as anything occurs on the\r\n     main point.\r\n\r\n     There is every appearance that the Flemish revolution is complete.\r\n     Trautsmansdorf and the patriots are running a race for Luxemburg,\r\n     where the former means to wait for succours. There are not fifteen\r\n     thousand troops in the provinces, and there are above forty\r\n     thousand of the patriots already armed, and the whole country with\r\n     them. They collect the revenues of the country, on which they\r\n     maintain their army. They flatter themselves that, allowing for the\r\n     necessary requisitions for passage, &c., no effectual force can be\r\n     brought to act against them till the spring; and the style of the\r\n     Emperor's concessions, as well as the mode of making them, looks as\r\n     if he was of the same opinion.\r\n\r\n     Ever most affectionately yours,\r\n     W. W. G.\r\n\r\nIt was some compensation to Mr. Grenville that, in his official capacity\r\nas Secretary of State, he had the satisfaction of conveying to Lord\r\nBuckingham His Majesty's entire approval of the line of conduct his\r\nLordship had pursued in Ireland. After expressing His Majesty's concern\r\nat the state of Lord Buckingham's health, which rendered him unable any\r\nlonger to serve His Majesty in the situation of Lord-Lieutenant, the\r\nletter signifies the royal approbation of his Lordship's attachment and\r\nzeal in the discharge of the important duties of his station; adding,\r\n\"and, particularly, I have His Majesty's express direction to acquaint\r\nyour Lordship with the satisfaction which His Majesty has felt from\r\nyour attention to maintain the honour and dignity of his Crown, and to\r\npreserve the constitutional connection between his two kingdoms of Great\r\nBritain and Ireland, under the interesting circumstances which were\r\noccasioned by His Majesty's late indisposition.\"\r\n\r\nFeeling the delicacy of the position in which he was placed by his\r\nrelationship to Lord Buckingham, in having to convey this gracious\r\nmessage, Mr. Grenville submitted a draught of the letter to His Majesty\r\nfor his approval, before it was forwarded. Upon this draught His Majesty\r\nmade the subjoined minute:\r\n\r\n     Windsor, October 17th, 1789. Eighteen minutes past Ten o'clock.\r\n\r\n     The draught of an answer to the Marquis of Buckingham's letter of\r\n     resignation meets entirely with my sentiments. If I thought any\r\n     alteration necessary, it would be by more explicitly stating the\r\n     allusion to his very commendable conduct, during my late calamitous\r\n     illness, which would render the approbation in effect more marked.\r\n\r\n     G. R.\r\n\r\nA retirement thus graced and dignified by the special approbation of the\r\nSovereign, left nothing for Lord Buckingham to regret in the scene of\r\nparty conflict he had quitted. It was an exchange from turmoil to peace,\r\nrendered still more acceptable to him by the expressions of regard and\r\nattachment it drew from some of the most distinguished men of his time.\r\nWell might Lord Fife congratulate him, in one of the numerous letters\r\naddressed to him at this period, on the difference he would find between\r\nStowe and the Castle of Dublin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1790.\r\n\r\nMR. GRENVILLE'S ELEVATION TO THE PEERAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe events of this year on the continent of Europe offer a striking\r\ncontrast to the repose of England. While the wise and steadfast policy\r\nof Mr. Pitt had secured to this country the blessings of peace, now\r\nrapidly expanding into a condition of almost unexampled prosperity,\r\nFrance was undergoing the throes of that desolating Revolution which\r\nbrought the Sovereign to the scaffold, and laid the train of those\r\ndisasters which finally expelled the Bourbons from the throne. There are\r\nfew traces of those disturbing circumstances in the correspondence of\r\nLord Buckingham and his brother, which, in consequence of the frequent\r\nopportunities they now enjoyed of personal intercourse, had become\r\nscanty, and, so far as public affairs were concerned, unimportant.\r\nSlight scraps of intelligence, the last rumour from abroad, or matters\r\nof purely personal or domestic interest, form the staple of the letters\r\nthat passed between them at this period.\r\n\r\nIt was in this year that Edmund Burke, to the infinite surprise of his\r\nold allies, published his famous pamphlet on the French Revolution. The\r\nimpression it made in England may be accepted as an evidence of the\r\nsoundness of the national judgment, and the devotion of the people to\r\nthe established institutions of the country. This healthy condition of\r\nthe public mind was attributable, in a greater degree than we can\r\nventure now to estimate, to the spirit of patriotism and union awakened\r\nin the kingdom by the firm Administration of Mr. Pitt and his friends.\r\nThey had restored the general confidence in the justice and stability of\r\nthe Government, which the weakness and divided councils of former\r\nCabinets had dissipated; they had struck the happy mean between the\r\nprerogatives of the Crown and the encroachments of the Legislature; and,\r\nabove all, in the recent conflicts on the Regency question, they had\r\nsuccessfully asserted the doctrine, that the rights of the Sovereign and\r\nthe rights of the people were founded on a common basis; and, by showing\r\nthat their interests were identical, they had reconciled those extreme\r\nelements in the Constitution which a powerful party had laboured, with\r\ngreat eloquence and considerable effect, to separate on the grounds of a\r\nnatural antagonism. Their popularity was unbounded, and saved the\r\ncountry. Paine's \"Age of Reason\" fell innocuous upon the people; the\r\ntidings of the Revolution, and of the massacres that tracked its daily\r\nsteps in blood, excited wonder and horror, but produced no frenzy of\r\nimitation such as they inspired elsewhere; and while Europe was\r\nconvulsed with alarms, England, strong in her liberties and\r\nself-reliance, was united and unmoved.\r\n\r\nIn Ireland, the departure of Lord Buckingham was followed by a revival\r\nof the factious intemperance his energy had for a season suppressed. The\r\nParliament opened in disorder, and carried on its debates in a tone of\r\nvindictive hostility to the British connection. The opponents of\r\nGovernment had strengthened their hands by the accession of new orators,\r\nand by the occasional lapses into their old violence of others who had\r\ngiven in their submissions to the late Viceroy, and who, now that he was\r\ngone, affected an independence of their obligations. The Lord Chancellor\r\nFitzgibbon was growing into increasing disfavour with the Opposition,\r\nand becoming, by the force of resistance, more English and less popular\r\nthan before. The invectives in which the wild passions of party found a\r\ncongenial vent, descended to the fiercest recriminations, and led to the\r\nseverance of friendships, and personal rencontres. Fitzgibbon and the\r\nPonsonbys, who had hitherto preserved unimpaired, amidst the contentions\r\nof the Senate, their intimate relations in private life, were now cast\r\nasunder by an explosion of animosity that tempted the Chancellor to\r\ndeclare \"that he would never speak to them again;\" even the close bonds\r\nthat united the Ponsonbys and the Beresfords were imperceptibly relaxed;\r\nand Mr. Hobart, to use his own expression, was \"obliged to fight Mr.\r\nCurran,\" for which he excuses himself to Lord Buckingham by saying that\r\n\"in any other country in Europe he would not have met him.\" In no other\r\ncountry, undoubtedly, from a cause so absurd and unwarrantable, could\r\nthe necessity for such a meeting have arisen. Numerous letters from\r\nIreland conveyed fragments of news of this kind to Lord Buckingham in\r\nhis retirement, the old supporters of Administration still seeming to\r\nlook up to him for encouragement and advice. But these letters are not\r\nnow of sufficient interest to justify their publication.\r\n\r\nSuch, indeed, is the general character of the correspondence of the\r\nyear. One letter, however, announces an incident which cannot be so\r\nsatisfactorily recorded as in the language of the writer. Mr. Grenville\r\nwas about to receive that recognition of his great talents and important\r\nservices which few men had earned so worthily or were destined to wear\r\nmore honourably and usefully. The absence of all exultation at his\r\napproaching elevation to the peerage, and his near assumption of the\r\ntitle by which he is best known in the history of the country, is a\r\ncharacteristic of that nobility of mind which conferred dignity upon,\r\nrather than derived it from, the station to which he was advanced.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. W. W. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     St. James's Square, Nov. 22nd, 1790.\r\n     MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     I send this by a messenger, in order to lose no time in informing\r\n     you that Pitt wrote yesterday to the King, to propose the measure\r\n     of my going to the House of Lords, and that he has received His\r\n     Majesty's acquiescence, in terms very satisfactory to me. The delay\r\n     has been occasioned by a sort of negotiation which has been pending\r\n     with the Chancellor for some time past, and which there seemed a\r\n     prospect of bringing to a point before the meeting. As the\r\n     determination respecting my peerage might possibly have been\r\n     affected, one way or the other, by this negotiation, we were\r\n     unwilling to decide that question finally till the last moment; but\r\n     as that last moment is now arrived, it seemed, after much\r\n     deliberation, better to take the step in the present situation of\r\n     things, rather than to wait the issue of a business, one event of\r\n     which could much have increased the difficulties of the measure\r\n     itself.\r\n\r\n     Pitt is gone to-day to Windsor, to lay before the King the whole of\r\n     the transaction, and to explain more fully the motives which have\r\n     induced us to wish for my being removed to the House of Lords.\r\n     There is no probability that this conversation will alter the full\r\n     consent which the King expressed yesterday by letter. If it does\r\n     not, it will be necessary that I should kiss hands on Wednesday, in\r\n     order to give time, which even that will barely do, for passing my\r\n     patent, &c., so as to enable me to take my seat on Friday, which is\r\n     the day on which the King makes his speech, and on which the\r\n     general Address will be moved in the House of Lords. We mean to fix\r\n     a separate day for considering the Convention, and to have a\r\n     particular Address upon it. The precise day for this is of course\r\n     not yet settled.\r\n\r\n     This arrangement will necessarily occasion a delay of two or three\r\n     days before the writ can be moved in the House of Commons, who do\r\n     not proceed to business till the Monday, on account of swearing the\r\n     Members; but this does not seem to me to be at all material, and I\r\n     am persuaded that you will feel with me that it is unavoidable. The\r\n     writ once moved, the election may come on upon the tenth, or at\r\n     latest, the eleventh day from the Monday, so that the whole notice\r\n     will not exceed a fortnight.\r\n\r\n     I reserve, till I see you, the particulars of the negotiation of\r\n     which I have spoken, and of our present situation with a view to\r\n     that important point. I am sorry for the delay in making the other\r\n     arrangements, but you must allow something for the difficulties\r\n     which always occur in bringing points of this nature to bear, and\r\n     for the various loads which press at such a moment as this on\r\n     Pitt's time, by whose personal negotiations alone all this must be\r\n     done. Pray let me know, by the return of my messenger, when I may\r\n     expect you in town.\r\n\r\n     I am sorry to hear of so long a sick list. Adieu, my dear brother,\r\n     and believe me\r\n\r\n     Ever most truly and affectionately yours,\r\n     W. W. G.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1791.\r\n\r\nTHE ROMAN CATHOLIC CLAIMS--RESIGNATION OF THE DUKE OF LEEDS--FLIGHT OF\r\nTHE ROYAL FAMILY OF FRANCE--PROSPERITY OF ENGLAND AT THIS PERIOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first object to which the attention of Ministers was addressed at\r\nthe opening of Parliament in 1791, was a measure for the further relief\r\nof the Roman Catholics. The only objection urged against it by the\r\nOpposition was that it did not go far enough. Mr. Pitt himself held the\r\nsame opinion, but did not consider it expedient to act upon it.\r\n\r\nThe interest which Lord Buckingham never ceased to feel in Ireland,\r\nwhere this question of Catholic disabilities was a spring of constant\r\nagitation, led him to regard the subject in relation to that country\r\nwith much solicitude. Agreeing in principle with Mr. Pitt, he held that\r\nthe Roman Catholics should be placed on the same footing in both\r\nkingdoms; and that whatever privileges were bestowed upon them in\r\nEngland should also, and at the same time, be granted to them in\r\nIreland. Mr. Hobart, who had been his Lordship's secretary during his\r\nlast Administration, and who was continued in that appointment by his\r\nsuccessor, Lord Westmoreland, corresponded with him frequently on this\r\ntopic; and it may be gathered from his letters that the views of the new\r\nLord-Lieutenant were unfavourable to the demands of the Roman Catholics.\r\nIn the early part of the correspondence, Mr. Hobart expresses\r\nconsiderable doubt about the policy of placing power in their hands,\r\nespecially with reference to their admission to the bar, which had been\r\nconceded to them in England. His observations on that particular point\r\nare curious. In Ireland, he remarks, the sentiments of the lawyers have\r\nconsiderable weight in the discussion of political subjects, which,\r\n\"whether it arises from the confident and pertinacious loquacity of\r\ngentlemen of that profession, or from the deference which is shown and\r\nfelt for those in whose hands are entrusted the most interesting\r\nconcerns of every family in the kingdom, and from their frequent\r\nintercourse with all parts of it, is matter of no consequence.\" The\r\ninfluence which the lawyers were thus supposed to possess, weighed\r\nstrongly with Mr. Hobart as an argument against the admission of the\r\nRoman Catholics to the bar. Such a measure might be adopted with\r\ncomparative safety in England, but it was likely in Ireland to be\r\nproductive of increased agitation and social disorder. The perplexities\r\nof the question were evidently taking a very distinct shape at this\r\ntime, and occupying no inconsiderable share of the attention of\r\nGovernment. In endeavouring to sift them, and to extricate something\r\nlike a practical line of policy from them, Mr. Hobart was not a little\r\nembarrassed by the example of England, which he could not quite make up\r\nhis mind either to follow or renounce.\r\n\r\n     The English Bill has put us under no small degree of difficulty.\r\n     The circumstances of the two countries, with respect to Roman\r\n     Catholics, are so different, that what may be extremely advisable\r\n     in the one, may be just the reverse in the other; and, therefore,\r\n     for us precisely to follow your Bill, would be to adopt a principle\r\n     which in its consequences might be productive of the greatest\r\n     mischief. Nevertheless, if we do not go so far, the Roman Catholics\r\n     of Ireland will be highly discontented; and if we go further, we\r\n     shall throw too much power into their hands.\r\n\r\nThat Lord Buckingham removed Mr. Hobart's objections as to the wisdom of\r\nconformity in legislating for the Roman Catholics in both countries, is\r\nindicated in a subsequent letter; but that Mr. Hobart differed from his\r\nLordship as to the prudence of maintaining a Government opposition\r\nbetween the two sects is no less apparent. Lord Buckingham's influence\r\nin moderating Mr. Hobart's opinions on other points is frankly admitted.\r\nMr. Hobart gave up his objections to admitting the Catholics to the bar,\r\nor even to the army or navy, if England should think fit to set the\r\nexample; but civil offices, or the elective franchise, he still\r\nconsidered highly dangerous.\r\n\r\n     My opinion, I speak with great deference, does not concur with\r\n     yours, as to the little importance of supporting the Protestants\r\n     against the Catholics; it is, in my mind, the link which binds the\r\n     two countries: break that, and you endanger the connection. Every\r\n     means should be exerted to prevent the struggle taking place; and,\r\n     therefore, every indulgence that with any degree of safety can be\r\n     given to the Roman Catholics, and more particularly at this time,\r\n     ought to be extended to them. Notwithstanding a variety of\r\n     objections, I cannot help thinking that the safest principle for\r\n     the Parliament of Ireland to adopt, is, that of following England\r\n     upon all questions relative to Roman Catholics; but it is of the\r\n     utmost consequence, that the Government of England should accede to\r\n     no measure upon that subject, without a due consideration of its\r\n     effect in Ireland, and fairly weigh the benefits to be attained in\r\n     the one country, against the disadvantages that may arise in the\r\n     other.\r\n\r\n     The example of England, if adopted as a principle, may be extremely\r\n     useful as a means of resisting inconvenient pretensions urged here;\r\n     for, whether avowedly adopted or not, it will always be made use of\r\n     by the Roman Catholics when they have anything to gain by it; and\r\n     ultimately they must be successful upon that ground. I would\r\n     therefore admit them to the bar; and if England opens the army and\r\n     navy to them, it should follow of course here; but admission to\r\n     civil offices, or anything that led to voting for Members of\r\n     Parliament, or sitting in either House, would, I conceive, be\r\n     highly dangerous in this country; because I am a friend to the\r\n     Protestant ascendancy, and that can be maintained only through the\r\n     medium of a Protestant Parliament, aided by a profitable\r\n     encouragement to those who profess that faith.\r\n\r\n     The times are growing so enlightened, or so depraved, that a man\r\n     need not live very long, to have a chance of seeing all religious\r\n     distinctions abolished; but so long as things remain in their\r\n     present state, I am strongly impressed with the idea, that the\r\n     connection between England and Ireland in a great degree depends\r\n     upon the maintenance of the Protestant ascendancy. It is the\r\n     principle which attaches the Parliament of Ireland to Great\r\n     Britain; it is the security for the property of those whose\r\n     influence gives them power in this country; it is the strength of\r\n     English government in Ireland. If ever the Roman Catholics should\r\n     acquire power enough to render the prospect of regaining their\r\n     properties sufficiently promising for the attempt, they must begin\r\n     by the destruction of English government. I do therefore consider\r\n     it indispensably necessary to give every degree of influence to the\r\n     Protestant interest; but that would be as a drop of water to the\r\n     sea, unless that interest was supported by the power of England.\r\n     But as I do not believe John Bull would much like to expend his\r\n     money in a struggle between the Protestants and Roman Catholics of\r\n     Ireland, merely on a crusade principle, I would not have him called\r\n     upon in a case wherein the ground to be maintained was not similar\r\n     to that which had been sanctioned by the British Parliament, and\r\n     might therefore, in a certain degree, be considered as the cause of\r\n     the empire.\r\n\r\n     You desire me to turn my thoughts to a permanent system. The only\r\n     permanent, practicable system that I can discover, is, that there\r\n     should at all times be a perfect understanding and concurrence\r\n     between the Governments of the two countries upon this subject;\r\n     that no step affecting the Catholics should be taken in England\r\n     without a minute attention to Ireland; and that the people of that\r\n     persuasion should be on the same footing in the two countries.\r\n\r\nThe entire passage may be accepted as an epitome of the principle on\r\nwhich Lord Westmoreland's Administration in Ireland was conducted; and\r\nthis authentic exposition of it is invested with some claim to\r\nhistorical importance.\r\n\r\nA letter from Lord Grenville in the beginning of the session refers to\r\ncertain new arrangements which were in progress in the Cabinet, but\r\nwhich did not materially affect its constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     St. James's Square, Feb. 4th, 1791.\r\n     MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     I should have written to you before on the subject of the\r\n     arrangements, if I had been able to say anything satisfactory or\r\n     decisive to you about them. But I think it right to mention to you\r\n     the state of the business, in order that you may know exactly how\r\n     it stands. An unexpected difficulty has arisen where we least\r\n     looked for it, on the part of Lord Hawkesbury, who has declined\r\n     exchanging the Duchy for the Mint, although he has been distinctly\r\n     told that the Cabinet is to be given him with the latter, and not\r\n     with the former. Whether he is playing any game in this we are\r\n     unable to discover, but such is the answer which he has given,\r\n     after having taken time to consider of it. This, as you see, at\r\n     once stops the whole business _in limine_, unless some solution can\r\n     be found for the difficulty; and I must confess I do not now see\r\n     what solution there is for it. It was not till two days ago that\r\n     this great man gave his answer, and therefore it is still, I think,\r\n     by no means impossible that his stomach may come down when he sees\r\n     Pitt determined to abide by this as a condition of the other, which\r\n     there is indeed no temptation to grant him without it. On the whole\r\n     it may be only a piece of magnificence, in order to give to his\r\n     admission to the Cabinet the appearance of a favour done by him,\r\n     instead of one received. But of all this you are as well able to\r\n     judge as ourselves, and none of us have anything to go upon but\r\n     conjecture. A few days may probably enable us to form a better\r\n     judgment, and for that we must wait.\r\n\r\n     It is, I am sure, unnecessary for me to say how much this\r\n     unexpected difficulty has hurt both Pitt and myself. I am racking\r\n     my brains to find a remedy for it, and shall be truly happy if any\r\n     such should occur either to you or to us.\r\n\r\n     The accounts of our dear Catherine are now such as I hope to put\r\n     all idea of present danger out of the question; but it has been a\r\n     most alarming attack, and I fear is only the earnest of much\r\n     suffering and frequent illness from the same cause, the existence\r\n     of which seems now to be but too clearly ascertained.\r\n\r\n     Everybody in London has been ill. I have not escaped my usual cold,\r\n     but am now getting well. I rejoice in the satisfactory account\r\n     which the Bulkeleys give of you.\r\n\r\n     Ever, my dear brother,\r\n     Most affectionately yours,\r\n     G.\r\n\r\n     They have suddenly stirred in Ireland a question about spirits,\r\n     beer, &c., which they seem to understand no more of than I do, who\r\n     have had no opportunity of learning anything about it. Lord W., in\r\n     one of his private letters, mentions some plan of yours about hops,\r\n     and I think I recollect something passing between us on the\r\n     subject, but have no trace what it was. I have a clerkship vacant\r\n     in my office: can it be made useful to any object of yours?\r\n\r\n     You probably know also that Selwyn's death gives me the disposal of\r\n     his office in Barbadoes, of between L100 and L500 per annum, but it\r\n     can be held only by a resident. I feel myself bound, in the first\r\n     instance, to offer to Nepean, who is killing himself by his labour\r\n     here, to give it to any proper person who will vacate anything for\r\n     it here. If that fails, you know I have no other idea of patronage\r\n     than that of consulting your wishes, or serving our joint objects.\r\n\r\nA little stray light is thrown upon this question of spirits and beer in\r\nIreland by Mr. Hobart in a letter to Lord Buckingham. The great evil\r\nwhich demoralized the Irish, including, it appears, even the country\r\ngentlemen, was whiskey-drinking; and with a view to diminish it, if\r\npossible, the Irish Government brought in a Bill, putting a heavy duty\r\non spirits, and liberating beer, hoping that the measure would act as a\r\nprohibition in the one case, and as an encouragement in the other.\r\n\r\n     Sobering the people of Ireland, I look upon to be an impracticable\r\n     undertaking; but the abominable use of whiskey, rendered it\r\n     necessary that Government should endeavour to do something which\r\n     might tend in some degree to check the evil. Meeting and\r\n     reconciling all the difficulties you have adverted to, I cannot\r\n     flatter myself has been accomplished; but we have struggled against\r\n     them as well as we could, and by not attempting too much, _perhaps_\r\n     we shall effect something. I enclose a paper, showing what will be\r\n     the state of the duties when the Bill passes; in addition to which,\r\n     we take all restrictions off the brewery, leaving the brewers at\r\n     liberty to sell at their own price, and to brew as they please. We\r\n     have also some hopes from regulations, to which we are encouraged\r\n     by the general outcry against whiskey, and assurances that country\r\n     gentlemen will _violate their natures_, and assist in carrying the\r\n     laws into execution. I must acknowledge that I am not very sanguine\r\n     upon the subject; but the magnitude of the grievance called for the\r\n     interposition of the legislature--_et librari animum meum_.\r\n\r\nThe subject of the following letter, although, from its nature,\r\ncautiously expressed, may be inferred from the allusion it contains to\r\nthe Duke of Leeds, who held the office of Secretary of State. His Grace\r\nwas on the eve of relinquishing the Seals, but, for reasons of his own,\r\nor, perhaps, to avoid embarrassing the Ministry, he desired his\r\nintentions to be kept secret. Having imposed this obligation on others,\r\nhe seems to have violated it himself, and thus his approaching\r\nretirement became known to Lord Buckingham before his Lordship received\r\nany intimation of it from Lord Grenville. The silence of his habitual\r\nand confidential correspondent on a point of so much interest disturbed\r\nLord Buckingham's sensibility; but it will be felt that Lord Grenville's\r\nvindication is conclusive.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Holwood, April 26th, 1791.\r\n     MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     I should certainly be much to blame if I were insensible to the\r\n     kindness of your last letter, though written under an impression,\r\n     in the justice of which I should be very sorry indeed to acquiesce.\r\n     I have little time for justifications on that subject, but my\r\n     anxiety to remove such an impression makes me say that I am not\r\n     conscious to myself of any want of that confidence towards you,\r\n     which our friendship demands, and which I wish to be reciprocal.\r\n     But that I neither ask of you, nor can think that you require from\r\n     me, the breach of actual or even of implied engagements to others,\r\n     not to divulge points in which they are concerned. A strict\r\n     observance of such engagements is surely the condition of all\r\n     honourable intercourse in society, and a duty from which no degree\r\n     of confidence, friendship, or affection towards a third person, can\r\n     absolve one. With respect to this particular case of the Duke of\r\n     L., I am sure your own reflections will not suffer you to impute\r\n     blame to me, if after having required from those with whom he was\r\n     acting an engagement of secrecy, which he had a right to demand\r\n     from them, his own levity, or any other reason, induced him to\r\n     divulge his own secret. Ask yourself, and I will leave the subject\r\n     there, whether you had rather have known this event, as has been\r\n     now the case, a day or two later than you might otherwise have\r\n     done, or have been the occasion of my doing an act which my own\r\n     mind would have reproached me with as dishonourable in itself, and\r\n     in this particular instance a breach of a positive promise which I\r\n     had given.\r\n\r\n     Surely if I am deserving of your confidence, or any man's, it can\r\n     only be so long as I feel the nature of such confidence, and fulfil\r\n     the obligations which it imposes upon me, even where the violation\r\n     of them might be of real advantage to you, much more where it could\r\n     have answered no one purpose of utility, or even of gratification.\r\n     All I can add is, that if I see this subject in too serious a\r\n     light, or entertain ideas too strict with respect to it, my\r\n     impressions upon it are at least those of serious reflection; and\r\n     that they are the same which direct my conduct towards the few\r\n     other persons who have a right, and none has so much right as\r\n     yourself, to affection and confidence from me.\r\n\r\n     I have anticipated your advice, and taken refuge here. I feel\r\n     already the advantage of air, and of rather more exercise than I\r\n     have been able lately to allow myself. I am sorry if my former\r\n     letter bore the appearance of depression, but you know that my mind\r\n     has not been at ease on other subjects, and will therefore allow\r\n     for the effect of the weight of fresh labour and anxiety suddenly\r\n     thrown upon me.\r\n\r\n     Ever, my dear brother,\r\n     Most truly and affectionately yours,\r\n     G.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Leeds resigned on the 8th of June, and was succeeded by Mr.\r\nDundas.\r\n\r\nAt this moment, not England alone, but all Europe, was engrossed by the\r\nstrange drama that was going forward in Paris. The first piece of\r\nintelligence that arrived was an announcement that the King and the\r\nroyal family had effected their escape at night from the Tuileries by a\r\nsubterranean passage leading to the Seine; and, as it afterwards\r\nappeared, that His Majesty had left behind him a paper formally\r\nrevoking, on the grounds of compulsion, the oaths and declarations to\r\nwhich he had been forced to subscribe. Lord Grenville conveyed the\r\nstartling news, just as it had reached him, in a hasty note to Lord\r\nBuckingham.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     St. James's Square, June 25th, 1791.\r\n     MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     The enclosed, which I received this morning from Lord Gower, will\r\n     inform you of the very unexpected event which has happened at\r\n     Paris. As the messenger came through Calais, he heard a report,\r\n     which was circulated with much confidence, that the King, &c., had\r\n     been stopped at a place which he calls Quinault, and which I guess\r\n     to be Quenoy in the Cambresis, if, indeed, there is any foundation\r\n     at all for the story. Montmorin is to write to Lucerne, to make a\r\n     communication here from the National Assembly, of _their_ intention\r\n     to maintain peace with other countries. We have, of course, not had\r\n     time to consider what answer to give, or what steps to take.\r\n\r\n     One of the French papers contains an account of a party of\r\n     travellers passing through Senlis about four or five in the same\r\n     morning, which evidently appears to have been the King and his\r\n     suite. This account was read at the Assembly; and confirms the idea\r\n     of their having taken the route of the Netherlands.\r\n\r\n     You will have the goodness to communicate this letter and its\r\n     enclosure, to Lord Camelford.\r\n\r\n     Ever most affectionately yours,\r\n     G.\r\n\r\n     Tell me what Lord Camelford and you think we ought to do; as it is\r\n     very possible we may not have taken our determination before I can\r\n     receive your answer.\r\n\r\nThe story was, of course, doubted at first. But it turned out to be true\r\nin every particular except the name of the place, which was Varennes.\r\nThe royal fugitives were seized on the 22nd of June, and carried back to\r\nParis to be confronted with the Provisional Executive Council that had\r\nbeen established as soon as their flight was known.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     St. James's Square, June 26th, 1791.\r\n     MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     The King and Queen of France were stopped at Varennes, a small town\r\n     between St. Menchond and Luxemburg. The post-master at St.\r\n     Menchond, suspected them to be aristocrats making their escape, and\r\n     followed the carriage. Seeing it strike out from the great road, to\r\n     Verdun, he got before them by another road, to Varennes, and gave\r\n     the alarm. When they arrived, the National Guard was already drawn\r\n     out; and they were forced to stop, and go into the inn. There they\r\n     were known by a man of the town. They were prevailed upon, without\r\n     much resistance, as it appears, on their part, to turn their\r\n     horses' heads, and to go back to Chalons, where they slept that\r\n     night. They were to sleep at Epernay the Thursday night; and were\r\n     expected in Paris, Friday, or more probably, Saturday.\r\n     Commissioners have been named by the Assembly, at the head of whom\r\n     is Barnave, to _protect their return_ to Paris. The proclamation,\r\n     or manifesto, left behind him, by the King is curious, and in some\r\n     parts well drawn. I hope to be able to send it you by to-morrow's\r\n     post. Paris had remained pretty quiet; but there was some\r\n     disposition in the Poissardes and Faubourg St. Antoine to assemble,\r\n     in order to manifest their joy. Bouille appears to have been in the\r\n     plot, and is suspended from his command by the Assembly, who have\r\n     also given orders to arrest him; but I suppose he is too wise to\r\n     suffer himself to fall into their hands.\r\n\r\n     Monsieur and Madame are safely arrived at Mons; so that if the King\r\n     had taken that route, he might probably have escaped. I feel\r\n     sincerely for him; and still more for the Queen, who, I imagine,\r\n     must expect to suffer much.\r\n\r\n     Ever most affectionately yours,\r\n     G.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     St. James's Square, June 29th, 1791.\r\n     MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     Lord Gower's courier arrived this morning, with an account of the\r\n     King and Queen being brought back to Paris. Everything passed with\r\n     a black and sullen silence; no mark of respect whatever was allowed\r\n     to be shown them. Biron and Lafayette were in the carriage with\r\n     them. The mob followed the carriage into the garden of Tuileries;\r\n     and on alighting, these wretched captives heard every species of\r\n     abuse and insult, that even a Paris mob is capable of.\r\n\r\n     They talk of sending the Queen to the Convent of Val de Grace for\r\n     the present; and the report is, they mean to try her. The King is\r\n     to undergo an interrogatory on Tuesday; and on the result of that,\r\n     it is supposed he is to be deposed, and the Dauphin declared King,\r\n     with a Council of Regency. These, as you will see, are all reports;\r\n     but the melancholy certainty is, that neither in Paris, nor in any\r\n     part of the country which we have heard of, does there seem the\r\n     least disposition to pity, and much less to assist them.\r\n\r\n     We have the bad news, that the Austrian Plenipotentiaries have\r\n     left Sistovo; but, as they express it, without breaking up the\r\n     Congress. The armistice is not renewed; but it seems as if it would\r\n     be continued by a sort of tacit consent. You will have seen in the\r\n     papers the further demands made by the Emperor, on which the\r\n     business has stopped.\r\n\r\n     Ever yours,\r\n     G.\r\n\r\n     The Queen's behaviour is said to have been admirable.\r\n\r\nEarly in this year, Ministers had moved and carried an Address from His\r\nMajesty, reporting the failure of his negotiations to bring about a\r\npeace between Russia and Turkey, and desiring to augment his naval\r\nforces for the sake of giving more weight to his interposition. This\r\nAddress was vehemently, but unsuccessfully, opposed in both Houses, on\r\nthe ground that such a course was calculated to lead to hostilities, and\r\nplunge the nation into an unnecessary expenditure. Advantage was taken\r\nof the occasion to make it appear that Mr. Pitt wanted to involve the\r\ncountry in the war, and that his policy was essentially injurious to the\r\nindustry and material welfare of the people. The following interesting\r\npassage from a letter of Lord Grenville's, dated the 17th of August, not\r\nonly disproves the imputation, but shows how anxious Ministers were to\r\nsecure peace, how much they were relieved and gratified by its\r\naccomplishment, and to what a height of prosperity they had succeeded in\r\nbringing the commerce and revenue of the kingdom.\r\n\r\n     We received this morning the account that the negotiations at\r\n     Sistovo are at last satisfactorily concluded. A definitive treaty\r\n     of peace, on the grounds of the _status quo_ strict, was to be\r\n     signed on the 4th of this month, under the mediation of the Allies;\r\n     and at the same time a separate Act, by which the Austrians and\r\n     Turks treat as powers between whom peace is already concluded (and\r\n     consequently without mediation) for some such arrangements of\r\n     frontier, and the settlement of a dispute about Old Orsova, which\r\n     town is to remain in the hands of Austria. You may suppose this\r\n     event gives me no small satisfaction; and I hope I shall now begin\r\n     to breathe a little, which I have hardly done since April last. You\r\n     can hardly form to yourself an idea of the labour I have gone\r\n     through; but I am repaid by the maintenance of peace, which is all\r\n     this country has to desire. We shall now, I hope, for a very long\r\n     period indeed enjoy this blessing, and cultivate a situation of\r\n     prosperity unexampled in our history. The state of our commerce,\r\n     our revenue, and, above all, that of our public funds, is such as\r\n     to hold out ideas which but a few years ago would indeed have\r\n     appeared visionary, and which there is now every hope of realizing.\r\n\r\nThe next letter refers to a matter of personal interest. A Rangership\r\nhad fallen vacant by the death of Lord Orford, and it appeared desirable\r\nto Lord Grenville to effect an exchange between that office and the\r\nreversion he held of the Chief Remembrancership in Ireland. Upon all\r\nquestions of this nature, as indeed on all questions that directly\r\naffected himself and his own objects, Lord Grenville was always\r\nreluctant to decide until he had first consulted Lord Buckingham, in\r\nwhose judgment and affection he reposed unbounded confidence.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     St. James's Square, Dec. 7th, 1791.\r\n     MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     I mentioned to you last week, that there was a subject I wished to\r\n     talk with you about; but as my getting down to Stowe seems to grow\r\n     every day more and more uncertain, and as the subject in question\r\n     is now brought to a point, I am obliged to write to you upon it;\r\n     though I cannot so easily say all I wish upon it in this manner. It\r\n     is, shortly, to ask your advice whether, in consequence of Lord\r\n     Orford's death, I should not exchange my reversion of Lord Cl.'s\r\n     office, for the immediate appointment to the Rangership, which I\r\n     apprehend it is clearly in the King's power to grant for life. The\r\n     different reasons, _pro_ and _con_, will as readily suggest\r\n     themselves to you as to me. The great points to be gained by the\r\n     exchange are, first, the certainty of some provision, instead of an\r\n     expectancy, which I may never live to enjoy; and what is still more\r\n     than that, the great advantage of having that provision in this\r\n     country, instead of looking for it in Ireland, subject to the\r\n     chance of what injustice party may be able to do in Ireland, which\r\n     they could not do here, and subject, also, to the general chance of\r\n     troubles in that country, which I fear are too probable. Against\r\n     this, is to be set some difference (as I believe) in the value of\r\n     the two offices, though I have not yet been able to ascertain it;\r\n     and the degree of invidiousness and clamour which my receiving any\r\n     new favour (for such this would undoubtedly be considered) would be\r\n     subject to, especially at a moment when Government are rather under\r\n     difficulties, and when I must expect so many competitors, for a\r\n     thing in many respects so desirable.\r\n\r\n     The impression of my own mind is, I confess, very strongly for\r\n     taking the step. Pitt is entirely ready to acquiesce in what I\r\n     judge best, though I can see he is, to a certain degree, alarmed at\r\n     the impression it may make. The thing has been generally opened to\r\n     the King as a possible arrangement, in order to prevent his\r\n     entering into any other engagements. I cannot describe the real\r\n     kindness of manner and expression with which he assured me of his\r\n     readiness to do in it whatever I wished. It rests, therefore, with\r\n     myself to decide; and although I have, as you see, a strong bias in\r\n     favour of the step, I do not feel confident enough of my own\r\n     opinion not to be very desirous of knowing yours. I fairly own to\r\n     you, that if I was _in the same situation_ as I was a year and a\r\n     half ago, I should be inclined to let this go by me, and to run my\r\n     chance for some better opportunity. But I certainly feel that after\r\n     the conduct which Lord C. has observed towards me on the subject of\r\n     money, I am (even as with respect to him) hardly as much at liberty\r\n     as I was to consult my own feelings, supposing that it were\r\n     possible for me to put out of the question another consideration a\r\n     good deal more interesting to me.\r\n\r\n     If the thing is to be done, \"then 'twere well it were done\r\n     quickly,\" in order to prevent applications from different people,\r\n     every one of whom might feel, to a degree, offended by the\r\n     preference, if his wishes were known. You will conceive, therefore,\r\n     for this reason, and from the anxiety of the suspense, how glad I\r\n     shall be to hear from you soon, as your affection is the only\r\n     quarter to which I can look for advice, founded on a view and\r\n     knowledge of my real situation. I hinted the thing generally to Tom\r\n     before he left town, but the unfortunate difference of politics\r\n     makes it impossible for me to talk over with him freely and fully\r\n     that part of the subject, which is a material one. He is getting\r\n     well very rapidly.\r\n\r\n     I have heard from Lord C. from Rome. He gives a very good account\r\n     of the health of the whole party. He had received letters from his\r\n     son and Mudge, which he tells me are all he could wish. He desires\r\n     to be remembered to you.\r\n\r\n     Adieu, my dear brother,\r\n     Ever most affectionately yours,\r\n     G.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1792.\r\n\r\nMR. PITT'S BUDGET--THE STATE OF IRELAND--THE KING DISMISSES LORD\r\nTHURLOW--DISCONTENTS IN ENGLAND--FRENCH EMIGRANTS--RETREAT OF THE DUKE\r\nOF BRUNSWICK--MEASURES OF INTERNAL DEFENCE--THE FRENCH CONVENTION\r\nDECLARES WAR AGAINST ENGLAND AND HOLLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the vast expenditure to which the country had been\r\nrecently exposed, the Budget, at the opening of Parliament in 1792, more\r\nthan realized the anticipations of Lord Grenville. The statement laid\r\nbefore the House of Commons by Mr. Pitt was a complete answer to the\r\napprehensions of the timid, and the taunts of the Opposition. There was\r\na clear surplus of L900,000 in the month of January, after paying the\r\ninterest of the National Debt, the annual million devoted to its\r\nextinction, the Civil List, the naval and military establishments, and\r\nall other items of current outlay. Upon this basis of unexampled\r\nprosperity the Minister proposed to remit a large amount of taxation,\r\nand to apply a further sum towards the extinction of the National Debt.\r\nHe did not regard this surplus as a temporary or transient incident,\r\nbut as the genuine and natural result of regular and permanent causes.\r\nIn the existing state of the continent, it was impossible to calculate\r\nwith certainty upon the future, and Mr. Pitt, even in this solid\r\ncondition of the national finances, was careful not to indulge in hopes\r\nof too sanguine a character, which a sudden turn of events, beyond the\r\ncontrol of English influence, might frustrate and disappoint. His\r\nlanguage was explicit as to his confidence in the present, but guarded\r\nas to his views of the future. \"On the continuance of our present\r\nprosperity,\" he observed, \"it is indeed impossible to count with\r\ncertainty; but unquestionably, there never was a time when, from the\r\nsituation of Europe, we might more reasonably expect a durable peace\r\nthan at the present moment.\" The subsequent course of European politics,\r\nunfortunately, did not bear out this expectation; but at the moment when\r\nit was uttered, the lull that had set in on the continent, and the\r\nflourishing state of our own trade and commerce, abundantly justified\r\nthe statement of the Minister. Some additional reliance on the stability\r\nof our prospects might also have been drawn from the fact that the\r\ndestinies of England were never in abler hands than those to whom they\r\nwere confided in 1792, with Mr. Pitt at the Treasury and Lord Grenville\r\nat the Foreign Office.\r\n\r\nParliament met on the 31st of January. The Speech from the Throne\r\nannounced the conclusion of the treaty between Austria and the Ottoman\r\nPorte, and the agreement to preliminaries between the latter and Russia.\r\nThe maintenance of peace was regarded, under the circumstances, as so\r\ncertain that His Majesty was induced to recommend for the consideration\r\nof Parliament an immediate reduction of the naval and military\r\nestablishments. The following letters, written before the opening of\r\nParliament, touch slightly on these affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     St. James's Square, Jan. 6th, 1792.\r\n     MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     My present idea on the subject of your last letter entirely agrees\r\n     with yours, and I wait only till the great bear returns to this\r\n     hemisphere to put it in execution roundly, and without reserve. The\r\n     only thing that restrains me is the extreme importance that I feel\r\n     it is of to my honour not to involve any other persons, and still\r\n     less a whole system of Government, in a personal contest, which I\r\n     am obliged to maintain (being embarked in it) for a personal\r\n     object. The mode of doing this is not without much difficulty, and\r\n     it is the only difficulty I feel on the subject.\r\n\r\n     Before I do anything decisive, I will certainly contrive in some\r\n     manner to talk it over with you, but till I know the precise time\r\n     of his return my motions are of course suspended. The moment I am\r\n     able I will write to you again.\r\n\r\n     The solution of the French enigma which you state is, that it is a\r\n     war of bullying on both sides, the two parties being equally afraid\r\n     of each other. In the meantime there certainly are some in France\r\n     who wish the war, but very many more who fear it, and the ruin of\r\n     their finances is approaching with very rapid strides indeed. What\r\n     a contrast we shall make with them, when I come to state to you the\r\n     particulars, about which I am now little less sanguine than I was\r\n     at Weymouth.\r\n\r\n     Ever most affectionately yours,\r\n     G.\r\n\r\nLORD GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     St. James's Square, Jan. 17th, 1792.\r\n     MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     Nothing more has passed _on the subject_, but a day or two will now\r\n     probably bring it to a point, as Dundas is to see _him_, and put\r\n     the question to him, yes or no, either to-morrow or Thursday. This\r\n     is not to be done with any message from me, a point which I have\r\n     thought it indispensably necessary to stipulate, in order that I\r\n     might not have to reproach myself with anything like personal\r\n     solicitation to _him_ on such a point. I feel this so material,\r\n     that I have made a pretext of going to take possession of my castle\r\n     on Thursday, in order to be completely out of the way of all\r\n     negotiation upon the subject. Pitt comes to me on Saturday, and\r\n     brings me the answer on which my future conduct must depend. I\r\n     shall remain there, if possible, till the Friday or Saturday\r\n     following. It would be very little out of your way to make it your\r\n     run on Tuesday, when you would certainly find me there, and I need\r\n     not say that I should, in any case, be extremely glad to see you\r\n     there; but more particularly if any further step is to be taken\r\n     about this business, in which I do not well see my way, because I\r\n     hardly see how I can take that line which my own situation\r\n     personally seems so loudly to demand, without involving more than I\r\n     should like to do of public consequences. If I alone were\r\n     concerned, my line would be very soon taken.\r\n\r\n     Ever, my dear brother,\r\n     Most affectionately yours,\r\n     G.\r\n\r\n     Everything looks like peace on the side of France.\r\n\r\nA letter from Mr. Hobart gives a sketch of the state of Ireland at this\r\ntime. The English Bill of toleration had produced a ferment in the\r\ncountry, and the war of religious animosity was assuming a more violent\r\naspect every day.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. HOBART TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Dublin Castle, Jan. 30th, 1792.\r\n     MY DEAR LORD,\r\n\r\n     The multiplicity of business, both public and _private_, in which I\r\n     have been engaged since I left Stowe, must plead my excuse for\r\n     having so long postponed writing to your Lordship. I cannot,\r\n     however, delay thanking you for the communication you have made\r\n     through Mornington on the subject of my marriage--a subject I\r\n     should not have been silent upon when I had the pleasure of seeing\r\n     you, had I not predetermined the case, and therefore was not open\r\n     to advice. I flatter myself you will be happy to hear that I have\r\n     received a most friendly and liberal letter from the Earl of Bucks\r\n     upon the occasion, and have experienced every attention and\r\n     kindness from all my friends, and a marked civility from all\r\n     persons here on both sides of the question.\r\n\r\n     You can have little idea of the ferment that has been raised on the\r\n     subject of Catholics. When I saw you, I talked of existing\r\n     prejudices, which would ever render it no easy task to carry the\r\n     English concessions. I little thought that the minds of the\r\n     Protestants could be so inflamed, as a variety of circumstances\r\n     (but principally the industry of Mr. R. Burke) has inflamed them.\r\n     He has endeavoured, and with too much success, to persuade the\r\n     Catholics that British Government were determined to compel the\r\n     Irish Administration, and through them the Parliament of Ireland,\r\n     to open the franchise to the Catholics; that therefore, if they\r\n     persevered in the assertion of their claims, they could not fail of\r\n     carrying their point. The alarm and indignation that this created\r\n     amongst the Protestants was such as I will not venture to describe;\r\n     but you may be assured that any Irish Government that countenanced\r\n     such a measure could not stand twenty-four hours afterwards, if the\r\n     Parliament was sitting. So far from the Protestants being likely to\r\n     be terrified into compliance, they instantly became desperate at\r\n     the very idea of it. The cry was, \"Let us bring it at once to an\r\n     issue. If England will not protect us, the sooner we know it the\r\n     better: anything is preferable to the horrid state of suspense we\r\n     are now reduced to; at all events, we must resist every concession.\r\n     Let us not make the Catholics stronger, the better to enable them\r\n     to annihilate us at a future day. The Protestants must unite for\r\n     their own protection; and although Mr. Pitt's Government will not\r\n     defend us, possibly the weight of all the Parliamentary power of\r\n     Ireland thrown into the scale of English Opposition may force them\r\n     into office, and they may be more disposed to favour us than the\r\n     present Administration.\"\r\n\r\n     These ideas were rankling in every man's mind when the Parliament\r\n     met, and it is with the utmost difficulty that we have been able to\r\n     remove them. I cannot paint more strongly to you the real situation\r\n     of the feelings of the House of Commons, than by telling you, that\r\n     a declaration from me upon my legs, \"that it was the determination\r\n     of the Government of _both_ countries to maintain the Protestant\r\n     establishment, and to resist any attempts by force or intimidation\r\n     that might be made to subvert it,\" afforded a degree of consolation\r\n     which, not having witnessed, you can hardly credit, so great was\r\n     the apprehension upon the subject.\r\n\r\n     The newspapers will have informed you of our proceedings upon that\r\n     day; I shall, therefore, only add that I am still doubtful of the\r\n     event of the Bill, but am inclined to believe we shall carry it. I\r\n     hear that, if the Ponsonbys are satisfied that there will be a\r\n     majority in favour of it, they will concur; if they think they can\r\n     throw it out, they will oppose. Should we carry the Bill, the\r\n     gentlemen of the Roman Catholics will be highly gratified, and the\r\n     rabble bullied--both circumstances which will tend very much to the\r\n     future quiet of the country.\r\n\r\n     I am informed that Mr. R. Burke and his employers have quarrelled,\r\n     and that Ireland may soon hope to be relieved from his gracious\r\n     superintendence. I am sure I heartily wish it, for he has\r\n     contrived, by his impudence, folly, and misrepresentations, to\r\n     awake animosities between the Protestants and Catholics that had\r\n     slept for fifty years, and that a reasonable man might have hoped\r\n     would have slept for ever. I see no ground to apprehend tumult of\r\n     any kind. The Catholics, I think, dare not stir; and the United\r\n     Irishmen, with Napper Tandy at their head, are sinking into\r\n     nothing. Napper, and indeed his friend Grattan, have totally lost\r\n     their influence in the Corporation.\r\n\r\n     The Duke of Leinster had committed himself very far indeed upon the\r\n     subject of franchise, and is now retreating through his Corporation\r\n     of Athy, who have addressed their representatives, Colonel Arthur\r\n     Ormsby and Mr. Falkiner, to support the Protestant ascendancy.\r\n\r\n     I am told that the northern people do not much object to our Bill.\r\n     Any one step further would have been totally impracticable, and\r\n     would have produced a confusion that no man could have foreseen the\r\n     consequence of.\r\n\r\n     My best compliments to Lady Buckingham.\r\n\r\n     Believe me ever, my dear Lord, with every respect and gratitude,\r\n     affectionately yours,\r\n\r\n     R. HOBART.\r\n\r\nAmidst the arrivals of foreign news, which every day created new\r\nexcitements in the political circles, a movement was beginning to be\r\nfelt in the Cabinet which was shortly to produce an important change in\r\nthe Administration. The eccentricities of the Chancellor had on several\r\noccasions given much uneasiness to Ministers. He seemed to move in an\r\norbit of his own, independently of his colleagues; while the influence\r\nhe exercised over the King's mind, and his repulsive bearing, made all\r\napproaches to him difficult and hazardous. The first consideration, when\r\nan unexpected question sprung up, was to ascertain what view Thurlow was\r\nlikely to take of it; and it was sometimes as necessary to conciliate\r\nhim and to wait upon his moods, as if he had been a powerful, but\r\ndoubtful supporter, instead of a member of the Government. \"We may do\r\nwith, but cannot do without him,\" appears to have been the general\r\nfeeling in reference to him; and it was only by the most skilful\r\nmanagement that Mr. Pitt averted those dissensions in the Cabinet which\r\nhis strange line of conduct had so palpable a tendency to provoke. At\r\nlast the Chancellor committed himself openly to a hostile vote upon a\r\nvital measure, and left it no longer possible for the Minister to\r\npalliate their differences by private negotiations. The character and\r\ndignity of the Administration was at stake, and there was but one\r\nalternative left. The extremity to which matters were thus reduced is\r\nglanced at hesitatingly by Lord Grenville. The commentary which he did\r\nnot think it right to make at such a moment may now, however, be\r\nsupplied. The vote of Lord Thurlow placed the Cabinet in this position,\r\nthat it remained for the King to choose between them. Mr. Pitt was\r\nprepared to resign, if the decisive advice he tendered to His Majesty\r\nwas not immediately acted upon.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     St. James's Square, May 15th, 1792.\r\n     MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     I have the happiness of being able to send you an account of the\r\n     capture of Seringapatam. The news is brought by a letter from a Dr.\r\n     Abercromby, who was sent with Lord Cornwallis's despatches, in the\r\n     'Vestal.' He put this letter on board another vessel in the\r\n     Channel, and it comes by express from Bristol.\r\n\r\n     A decisive action took place about the 6th of January, at a village\r\n     near Seringapatam. Tippoo's army was entirely routed, and a few\r\n     days after the place surrendered. Tippoo is said to have been\r\n     wounded in the action, and carried to the hill-fort: this is all we\r\n     know. If the \"Gazette\" is out in time, Goddard will send it you.\r\n\r\n     The Duke of P. and his friends have declined being at the Council.\r\n     We mean, nevertheless, to take the step, and to propose Addresses\r\n     in both Houses of Parliament. It seems impossible for them not to\r\n     support us there, but it is at least right to bring it to a point.\r\n     When the day is fixed for the motion in the House of Lords I will\r\n     let you know it, as I think you will wish to be present, and\r\n     probably may be desirous of expressing your opinion. I consider the\r\n     Duke of P.'s refusal as an additional proof of the decisive\r\n     influence Fox possesses over their minds when he chooses to exert\r\n     it.\r\n\r\n     You will have seen that the Chancellor opposed the National Debt\r\n     Bill yesterday _by surprise_, and had nearly beat us. What this may\r\n     lead to, I do not yet know; but as at present advised, I think the\r\n     consequences must be decisive on his situation or ours. But it\r\n     requires some reflection, and some management in the quarter that\r\n     you know.\r\n\r\n     Ever, my dear brother,\r\n     Most affectionately yours,\r\n     GRENVILLE.\r\n\r\nThe \"quarter\" alluded to had the courage to decide not only wisely but\r\npromptly, and Thurlow was peremptorily called upon to resign.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     St. James's Square, May 18th, 1792.\r\n     MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     The King has charged Dundas with a message to the Chancellor,\r\n     stating the necessity he was under of making his option, and\r\n     therefore requiring him to give up the Seals, leaving the time to\r\n     his choice. The Chancellor is to see the King to-day, and after\r\n     that the thing will, I imagine, be immediately announced, though I\r\n     hardly think it can take place till the end of the session. Our\r\n     present idea is to put the Seals in Commission, with Eyre at the\r\n     head, which (with the vacation) will give time for future\r\n     arrangements. It is impossible as yet to guess at the success of\r\n     those arrangements, but I imagine they would unquestionably be much\r\n     facilitated by the sacrifice you so generously offer. I have not,\r\n     however, thought myself at liberty to make any use of what you say\r\n     on that subject, nor will I, as I think that if you make up your\r\n     mind to so very handsome an offer, you ought at least to have the\r\n     merit with Pitt of announcing it to him, instead of its having the\r\n     appearance of passing in any manner through me.\r\n\r\n     We shall, I believe, issue the proclamation to-day or to-morrow at\r\n     latest, and Friday is, I think, the most likely day for the Address\r\n     in the House of Lords; but you shall hear further from me. I say\r\n     nothing of that part of the Indian news which _is_ true, as you\r\n     will already have seen it in all the papers.\r\n\r\n     The King has conducted himself towards Pitt in this unpleasant\r\n     situation in a manner the most handsome possible, and such as must\r\n     leave a lasting impression in our minds. I do not look without\r\n     some uneasiness at the increase of personal labour of all sorts\r\n     which this will bring upon me; _mais le vin est tire_.\r\n\r\n     Ever most affectionately yours,\r\n     G.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     St. James's Square, June 13th, 1792.\r\n     MY DEAREST BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     I know you share the happiness I feel, in learning that _my\r\n     travellers_ were to be at Brussels in the course of last week, and\r\n     did not purpose making more than four or five days' stay there, so\r\n     that I may reasonably expect them here from day to day. I am\r\n     rejoiced that my holidays have begun before they are arrived. We\r\n     prorogue on Friday, and have finished all our business to-day,\r\n     which is a great load off my shoulders. The Chancellor is to give\r\n     up the Seals immediately, and they will be put into Commission with\r\n     Eyre, Buller, and Wilson, as I imagine, though the names are not\r\n     yet quite settled. We shall have the summer to look about us; and I\r\n     feel no great uneasiness even at the thoughts of meeting them again\r\n     precisely as we are, if that should be the case.\r\n\r\n     There is no news of any sort, except the continuance of the French\r\n     follies, which you read day by day in their papers, as fully, and\r\n     indeed often much more so, than I could detail them. There have\r\n     been some great failures at Bordeaux, and some at Paris, which\r\n     makes those few of our merchants who are concerned with them look\r\n     about them a little.\r\n\r\n     Our Addresses are going on swimmingly, and it will, I think, soon\r\n     be time for the loyal county of B. to show itself. They expect a\r\n     dust in Surrey, which my good Lord Onslow does not seem to have\r\n     quite wit enough to lay.\r\n\r\n     Ever most affectionately yours,\r\n     G.\r\n\r\nTwo days after the date of this letter, Parliament was prorogued, and\r\nthe Chancellor sent in his resignation.\r\n\r\nThe events that were taking place in France had recently awakened in\r\nEngland a spirit of sympathy amongst the lower classes, which it was\r\napprehended might lead to disastrous consequences, if strong measures\r\nwere not adopted for its suppression. Several associations were\r\nestablished in London and elsewhere to give practical effect to the\r\ndemocratic and revolutionary doctrines of the day, under such titles as\r\nthe Corresponding Society, the Revolution Society, and the Society for\r\nConstitutional Information; and some of them carried their views so far\r\nas to transmit congratulatory addresses to the National Assembly. The\r\nGovernment, seeing the peril that was impending over the country, took\r\nimmediate measures for the suppression of seditious correspondence\r\nabroad, and revolutionary publications at home. A proclamation embodying\r\nthese objects was laid before Parliament towards the end of May, and\r\ncarried without a division, notwithstanding a violent opposition from\r\nMr. Grey and others, who had formed themselves into a Society called\r\n\"The Friends of the People,\" for the ostensible purpose of appeasing the\r\ndiscontents, by obtaining a reform in the representation.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the prorogation of Parliament, meetings were held all\r\nover the country, to testify to the King the loyalty and gratitude of\r\nthe population, and to return thanks to His Majesty for the activity and\r\ndecision with which the dangers of the crisis had been met. In the\r\ncourse of two or three months, the number of addresses that were voted\r\nat these meetings and presented to the King amounted to three hundred\r\nand forty-one.\r\n\r\nIt is to these circumstances Lord Grenville alludes in the closing\r\nparagraph of the last letter. In the next communication he urges Lord\r\nBuckingham to move the Address in his own county; and in the letters\r\nthat follow he touches upon the progress of the sanguinary drama that\r\nwas then enacting in Paris. The domestic allusions refer to his\r\napproaching marriage.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     St. James's Square, June 21st, 1792.\r\n     MY DEAREST BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     Although I have as yet no tidings of my travellers, I feel so\r\n     confident of their being here before the day fixed for the Address,\r\n     that I think I run no risk in promising to be there _at all\r\n     events_. I have, however, no idea that the noble Marquis will give\r\n     us the meeting; though I will own to you, there are few things\r\n     which I should like better. I think the Address perfectly\r\n     unexceptionable as it now stands; but I should wish to add a\r\n     sentence somewhere, expressing the satisfaction and concurrence of\r\n     the county in the sentiments expressed _by Parliament_ on this\r\n     subject, because I think it may not be indifferent to future\r\n     debates, to have to quote expressions of this sort, in order to\r\n     show that, on a great occasion like this, the sense of the people\r\n     was immediately and completely expressed by Parliament. I enclose\r\n     you the Devonshire Address, which Fortescue sent me. It was drawn\r\n     by him; and I think singularly well put together.\r\n\r\n     It appears to me, that you ought certainly to move the Address\r\n     yourself; this not being a case where the common objections apply,\r\n     but rather the contrary. In that case, perhaps, some person of\r\n     higher rank ought to second than Drake, Duke of Portland, or Lord\r\n     Chesterfield, or Lord Inchiquin, or Lord Hampden. If, however, you\r\n     have actually applied to him, it must be managed as well as it can.\r\n\r\n     Do you advertize the meeting in the London papers? I think you\r\n     ought to write to Lord Chesterfield. When you return me the\r\n     Address, I will put it into Tom's hands for the Duke of Portland. I\r\n     think this meeting ought by no means to supersede the idea of the\r\n     Grand Jury presentment. If you still think that right, I will\r\n     contrive that Lord Loughborough, who goes your circuit, shall have\r\n     a hint to prepare the way for it by his charge. You will, of\r\n     course, be very civil to him. Whether it will come to anything I\r\n     have not; but there is reason enough to be civil to him, as I will\r\n     explain when we meet.\r\n\r\n     The Berlin news is nothing more than the common story of a squabble\r\n     between Mistress and Favourite, in which, contrary to custom,\r\n     Favourite has this time got the better of Mistress. As far as it\r\n     goes, it is unfavourable to the Jacobins; for the whole project of\r\n     French interference is Bishopwerder's; and the crime imputed to the\r\n     other, is a leaning towards the democrats.\r\n\r\n     I need not tell you how much I feel the kindness of what you say\r\n     about my domestic concerns, and the near approach of my prospects.\r\n     I am sure you do me the justice to think that I am not insensible\r\n     of all your affection to me on that subject, as, indeed, on every\r\n     other. Till they arrive, I can form no guess of their plans, nor,\r\n     consequently, of my own; but, as I shall certainly see you so soon,\r\n     either here or at Aylesbury, we shall be able to talk about it;\r\n     and, till then, I think you had better not write to Lord C. on the\r\n     subject of Stowe, for a reason which you perhaps guess.\r\n\r\n     Ever most affectionately yours,\r\n     G.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     St. James's Square, June 25th, 1792.\r\n     MY DEAREST BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     Having been out of town Saturday and Sunday, I did not get the East\r\n     India news time enough to write to you. The newspapers contain all\r\n     we know or have received. There is no doubt of the authenticity of\r\n     the \"Bombay Gazette,\" the original of which is received. But it\r\n     seems very odd how the news should first reach Bombay through the\r\n     Nizam's Durbar. On the whole, however, I see no sufficient ground\r\n     to disbelieve it; and, if true, it is as good as the most sanguine\r\n     wishes could have desired.\r\n\r\n     Lord Camelford is landed at Deal, and will be in town to-morrow\r\n     night. I shall, therefore, certainly keep my engagement for Friday.\r\n     I shall see Tom this morning, and will put the Address into his\r\n     hands, to be communicated to the Duke of Portland, and will also\r\n     talk to him about the Grand Jury. The new French Ministry is wholly\r\n     Fayette's, and by his letter he seems to think himself strong\r\n     enough to take the whole into his own hands and keep it. I have,\r\n     however, no opinion of his judgment. I am persuaded his plan is to\r\n     negotiate with the two Courts, and he will find a ready ear to all\r\n     he can say there. The Princes are wholly excluded, and\r\n     systematically so, from all that is doing, and will scarce be\r\n     allowed the honour of fighting should it come to blows. And the\r\n     King will be too happy to yield to any compromise that he may think\r\n     will insure his personal safety. And so far for prophecies, in\r\n     which you know I do not deal much.\r\n\r\n     Ever most affectionately yours,\r\n     G.\r\n\r\n     P.S.--The enclosed is for Lord Buckingham. Pray let it be put among\r\n     the portraits of other heroes. It is original, and Liston says\r\n     very like. The whipping-post, knife, and pistol, are also\r\n     portraits.\r\n\r\n     I open my letter again to tell you, that by way of anniversary of\r\n     the 20th, there was a procession of the two faubourgs with pikes,\r\n     &c., to the National Assembly. From thence they went to the\r\n     Tuileries, to present what they called a petition to the King. He\r\n     ordered them to be let in, and they entered, notwithstanding the\r\n     National Guard, who were there in force, but made no resistance,\r\n     though it is said they were disposed to it if they had been\r\n     encouraged. They remained three hours in the King's room, loading\r\n     him with insults, and demanding the recal of the Jacobin Ministers,\r\n     and the sanction for the two decrees. They put the red cap upon his\r\n     head, upon the Queen's, and upon the Dauphin. They were at length\r\n     persuaded to disperse by Petion telling them that they had\r\n     sufficiently manifested their patriotism. The King is said to have\r\n     behaved with uncommon firmness and apparent indifference. The whole\r\n     was expected, and had been announced for a week, and you see how it\r\n     was met. The Jacobins feel it a complete triumph, and talk of\r\n     sending La Fayette to Orleans.\r\n\r\n     Luckner has taken possession of Menin, Ypres, and Courtrai, the\r\n     latter after some resistance, in which the Austrians lost about one\r\n     hundred men. An action was expected every hour.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     July 2nd, 1792.\r\n     MY DEAREST BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     I have a whole budget of news for you, but I must begin with what\r\n     interests myself most, which is, the thanking you again for your\r\n     kindness to your _future sister_. I have told her of it, and she\r\n     feels it as she ought to do. You know I do not deal much in long\r\n     speeches, nor do you much delight in hearing or reading them; but I\r\n     am sure that you do me the justice to believe me not the less\r\n     sensible of all your affection to me, which I have experienced in\r\n     every stage of my life, and most of all on the most interesting\r\n     occasion of it. I feel that it is to you I owe my happiness.\r\n\r\n     When you give your directions to Froggatt, will you be so good as\r\n     to bid him put in Lord Camelford's name as the trustee.\r\n\r\n     Now for news. The \"Gazette,\" which Goddard sends you, will tell you\r\n     of Lord Cornwallis's victory. We have this morning a letter from\r\n     Brooke at St. Helena, enclosing a \"Madras Courier,\" with the\r\n     account of a second victory, followed by a peace, in which Tippoo\r\n     stipulates to cede _half his dominions_ to the allies, and to pay\r\n     them L3,500,000 for the expenses of the war, and to give his two\r\n     sons for hostages. Nothing can appear more complete; but I wait\r\n     with impatience for Lord Cornwallis's despatches, as the above\r\n     expression relative to the cessions is so very loose.\r\n\r\n     Lafayette has left his army to go to Paris, and has made a speech\r\n     to the Assembly, threatening them in pretty plain, though guarded\r\n     terms, with the resentment of his army, if they do not punish the\r\n     outrages of the 21st, and demolish the Jacobins. His friends moved\r\n     to refer his address to the _commission des douze_, which was\r\n     carried on the _appel nominal_ by 110 majority. He was afterwards\r\n     carried in triumph to the Tuileries by the National Guards. But the\r\n     Jacobins are not stunned, and much disturbance was expected in\r\n     Paris.\r\n\r\n     I take it for granted you have told my own news to Lady B., and\r\n     therefore do not trouble her with a letter. Will you be so good as\r\n     to say everything that is most kind to her, both from Anne and\r\n     myself.\r\n\r\n     Ever, my dear brother,\r\n     Most affectionately yours,\r\n     GRENVILLE.\r\n\r\nCrowds of emigrants that were driven out of France by the massacres\r\nthat were going on there, night and day, swarmed into the streets of\r\nLondon, where they wandered about in great distress. The majority of\r\nthese people were priests; and it was computed that the number of French\r\nrefugees that landed in England, between the 30th of August and the 1st\r\nof October, amounted to nearly four thousand. Large subscriptions were\r\nraised for their relief; but as it was essential that the protection\r\nextended to them should not be abused, Lord Grenville turned his\r\nattention to the necessity of providing some measure for regulating the\r\nassistance they received, and guarding against any sinister advantage\r\nthe disaffected amongst them might be disposed to take of the asylum\r\nwhich the free institutions of this country threw open to them. Here we\r\nhave the first suggestion of the Alien Bill, which, three months\r\nafterwards, Lord Grenville introduced into Parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     St. James's Square, Sept. 20th, 1792.\r\n     MY DEAREST BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     We returned here from our expedition the day before yesterday,\r\n     having passed through Weymouth in our way. We left Lord Camelford\r\n     far from well, and in the intention of coming immediately to town,\r\n     in order to set out again for the continent. It is a melancholy\r\n     reflection to think that he should again so soon be obliged to\r\n     leave us.\r\n\r\n     My sudden expedition from Castlehill has delayed my return here so\r\n     much later than I expected, that I fear it cuts off all hope of my\r\n     making you a visit in the autumn at Stowe. Pitt goes to-day to take\r\n     possession of his castle. I suppose you will have heard that Paine\r\n     had a very narrow escape at Dover. I send you the enclosed, because\r\n     you may, perhaps, not have seen it, and I am sure it will please\r\n     you. Pray read Necker's last work.\r\n\r\n     We have no news from the armies, except that the siege of\r\n     Thionville was turned into a blockade, and a general action hourly\r\n     expected. The Duke of Brunswick's progress does not keep pace with\r\n     the impatience of our wishes, but I doubt whether it was reasonable\r\n     to expect more. The detail of the late events at Paris is so\r\n     horrible, that I do not like to let my mind dwell upon them; and\r\n     yet I fear that scene of shocking and savage barbarity is very far\r\n     from its close. I deliver this day to the Imperial and Neapolitan\r\n     Ministers a note, with the formal assurance that in case of the\r\n     murder of the King or Queen, the persons guilty of that crime shall\r\n     not be allowed any asylum in the King's dominions. Opinions are a\r\n     little doubtful about the best means of giving effect to this\r\n     promise, should the case arise. Our lawyers seem clear, and\r\n     Blackstone expressly asserts, that the King may prevent any alien\r\n     from coming into the kingdom, or remaining there. But this power\r\n     has so rarely been used, that it may, perhaps, be better to have a\r\n     special Act of Parliament applying to this case. This, however,\r\n     relates only to the mode. I imagine everybody will think the thing\r\n     itself right, and some people seem to hope it may prevent the\r\n     commission of the crime in question. In this hope I am not very\r\n     sanguine.\r\n\r\n     We have no account of Spain having declared war, except what comes\r\n     through France.\r\n\r\n     God bless you, and believe me\r\n     Ever most affectionately yours,\r\n     GRENVILLE.\r\n\r\nThe retreat of the combined army, under the Duke of Brunswick, cast a\r\ngloom over the hopes of the struggling royalists. The soldiers had\r\nsuffered severe sickness from eating the unripe grapes of Champagne,\r\nand, contrary to the expectations in which they had been led to indulge,\r\nthe peasantry everywhere opposed them by attacking detachments, and\r\nbreaking up the roads.\r\n\r\nWhilst these events were spreading consternation over the continent, the\r\nproceedings of the Irish Roman Catholics were of a nature to awaken\r\nserious uneasiness in England. The whole country was convulsed on the\r\nsubject of concessions, the debates in Parliament exhibited unexampled\r\nintemperance, and it was said that subscriptions to the extent of nearly\r\nthree millions had been entered into with the intention of purchasing\r\nlands in America, should the demands of the Roman Catholics be refused.\r\n\r\nWhatever opinion Lord Grenville and Mr. Pitt might have previously\r\nentertained as to the justice or policy of granting further relief, was\r\nmuch shaken by the attitude which the Irish assumed at this alarming\r\njuncture. It was no longer possible to deal with the question on the\r\ngrounds on which it originally rested; and the Imperial Government could\r\nnot compromise its influence and authority by yielding to menace those\r\nclaims which it was willing to accept as a legitimate subject for\r\ndeliberate legislation. Out of these unfortunate checks, hindrances, and\r\ndistrusts on both sides, arose that calamitous condition of Ireland\r\nwhich broke out a few years afterwards into open rebellion; but, looking\r\nback dispassionately on these events at this distance of time, it is\r\ndifficult to see how that disastrous issue could have been prevented.\r\nThe hazard lay between going too far and not going far enough, with the\r\ncertainty that whatever was done must have fallen short of satisfying\r\none party, and in an equal degree must have dissatisfied another. It was\r\nalso a matter of continual perplexity with the Government to find the\r\nright moment for initiating the policy of conciliation. There were\r\nalways moments when, in certain shapes, it would have suited one party\r\nor the other; but the moment when it would have suited both never came.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     St. James's Square, Oct. 11th, 1792.\r\n     MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     We go to Dropmore to-morrow, to fix ourselves for the remainder of\r\n     the autumn--if any autumn remain. I shall be very much obliged to\r\n     you for your cargo, whenever Mr. Woodward's prudence allows him to\r\n     send it.\r\n\r\n     We are all much disappointed with the result of the great\r\n     expectations that had been formed from the Duke of Brunswick's\r\n     campaign. According to the best accounts I can get, of a business\r\n     involved in almost inextricable mystery, the flux--which had got\r\n     into his camp--was the true cause of his retreat. Whatever be the\r\n     cause, the effect is equally to be regretted. The plan seems now to\r\n     be, to hold Verdun and Longwy; and to employ the interval before\r\n     the spring allows them to march forwards again, in besieging the\r\n     different frontier towns in the neighbourhood. But the example of\r\n     Thionville will prevent the success of intimidation, or of _coups\r\n     de main_; and the opening trenches is impossible, at least, till\r\n     the post comes. Clairfayt's corps of about twenty thousand men is\r\n     to march towards the Low Countries, to prevent them from being\r\n     insulted.\r\n\r\n     I have thought much of the Irish business. I am very much inclined\r\n     to think that the alarms stated by the people there are much\r\n     exaggerated, partly with the view of producing an effect here, and\r\n     partly, because you know such is the genius of that people to carry\r\n     everything to extremes. Allowing, however, for this, there is\r\n     certainly much real cause for alarm. It is, I think, clearly\r\n     impossible not to resist the demands of the Catholics, in the\r\n     manner and circumstances in which they are now made. How far it was\r\n     prudent to have gone last year, in voluntary and gratuitous\r\n     concession, I know not, and really feel that it requires more local\r\n     knowledge than I possess to decide. My leaning was certainly in\r\n     favour of going as far as could be gone with safety, but no person\r\n     is authorized to state even that leaning; and the subsequent\r\n     conduct of the Catholics does, in my opinion, go far to shake any\r\n     opinion which might then have been entertained in favour of further\r\n     concession.\r\n\r\n     My idea, therefore is, that the Irish Parliament must be enabled to\r\n     meet the struggle, if struggle there is to be, by having the means\r\n     put into their hands of calling forth all the resources of that\r\n     country; which, if called forth, I believe to be very great indeed.\r\n     That this may not ultimately lead to some drain upon the purse and\r\n     force of this country, is more certain than any man would affirm,\r\n     who sees what has passed in France. But the probability is, I\r\n     think, against it. I am inclined to believe, that the voting an\r\n     increase of the army may be a wise measure of intimidation, and as\r\n     such, it will be stated to that Government for consideration; but,\r\n     on the other hand, any increase of expense, which is to lead to\r\n     increase of taxes, is certainly objectionable. My own persuasion\r\n     is, that with a very little firmness, the Convention of 1793 will\r\n     vanish like that of 1783; but this is no reason for neglecting\r\n     reasonable measures of precaution.\r\n\r\n     Ever most affectionately yours,\r\n     GRENVILLE.\r\n\r\nIn these letters occur the first allusions to Dropmore, Lord Grenville's\r\nseat in Buckinghamshire, which he had recently purchased, and upon the\r\nembellishment of which he bestowed all the spare hours he could rescue\r\nfrom the fatigues of public business. The trees, acknowledged in the\r\nfollowing letter as having been just received from Stowe, were destined\r\nto convert a common into pleasure-grounds, under the direction of his\r\naccomplished taste, which \"made the wilderness smile,\" and transformed a\r\nremote country nook into a scene of singular and matchless beauty.\r\n\r\nThe state of Europe, and the views of the writer in reference to it, are\r\ntreated at large in this letter, which is of great historical value as\r\nan exposition of the firm and judicious course pursued by Lord Grenville\r\nthrough a period of universal panic and confusion. To have kept England\r\nin tranquillity aloof from the perils that were devastating the\r\ncontinent, and to have sustained her in such prosperous circumstances as\r\nto justify the hope that in the next year the Government might be\r\nenabled to announce a further remission of taxes, furnishes a triumphant\r\nanswer to the charge so frequently brought against Mr. Pitt's\r\nAdministration, of wantonly encouraging a policy that plunged the\r\ncountry into a profligate war expenditure.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     St. James's Square, Nov. 7th, 1792.\r\n     MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     The trees arrived safe at Dropmore yesterday, and we were at their\r\n     unpacking in the middle of such a fog as I never saw before. They\r\n     will answer admirably well for my purpose, and will make a great\r\n     figure on my hill in the course of a century or so, provided always\r\n     that the municipality of Burnham does not cut them down sooner.\r\n\r\n     I cannot deny that you have some reason to complain of my silence\r\n     for the last month, but you have the kindness to assign the true\r\n     cause; unless, indeed, I was to add another almost equally\r\n     strong--I mean the absolute want of anything to say. This sounds\r\n     strange, but it is not the less true. The _events_ you read in the\r\n     newspapers, often before I get them, and they have been such as it\r\n     could give me little pleasure to detail. The causes have been hid,\r\n     _caliginosa nocta_, in a fog almost as thick as that of yesterday,\r\n     and I have been among the guessers only, and not always among those\r\n     who were luckiest in their guesses. I bless God, that we had the\r\n     wit to keep ourselves out of the glorious enterprize of the\r\n     combined armies, and that we were not tempted by the hope of\r\n     sharing the spoils in the division of France, nor by the prospect\r\n     of crushing all democratical principles all over the world at one\r\n     blow. But having so sturdily resisted all solicitation to join in\r\n     these plans, we have been punished for our obstinacy by having been\r\n     kept in profound ignorance of the details by which they were to be\r\n     executed, and even of the course of events, as far as that could be\r\n     done, which occurred during the progress of the enterprize. Now\r\n     that it has failed, we must expect these deep politicians to return\r\n     to the charge, and to beg us to help them out of the pit into which\r\n     they wanted to help us. But they have as yet been in no hurry to\r\n     begin this pleasant communication, and most assuredly we are in no\r\n     disposition to urge them on faster. You have here, therefore, the\r\n     explanation of the total impossibility in which I find myself to\r\n     explain all the inexplicable events of the last two months\r\n     otherwise than by conjecture. It is but lately that I have thought\r\n     I had even grounds enough to guess by. But you shall hear my guess.\r\n     The Austrians and Prussians thought they were marching to certain\r\n     victory. The emigrants, who had given them this idea, confirmed\r\n     them in it till the facts undeceived them. The Duke of Brunswick,\r\n     who joins to great personal valour great indecision of mind, and\r\n     great soreness for his reputation, hesitated to take the only means\r\n     that could have insured success--a sudden and hazarded attack. The\r\n     more he delayed, the more difficult his position grew. He then\r\n     attempted to buy a man, who, under other circumstances, would have\r\n     been very purchasable; failed in this; lost time; excited distrust\r\n     and jealousy among his allies; dispirited his own troops; and ended\r\n     his enterprize by a disgraceful retreat, which coffee-house\r\n     politicians are, as usual, willing to attribute to all sorts of\r\n     causes except the natural and obvious one. The subsequent successes\r\n     of the French are natural. An army that expected to be in Paris in\r\n     October, had naturally taken little precaution to prevent the\r\n     French from attacking Germany in the same month. The French\r\n     officers, who could have no authority over their armies in defeat\r\n     and disgrace, have naturally acquired it in success; and the\r\n     business will begin again in the spring, being about twice as\r\n     difficult as it was when it began this autumn.\r\n\r\n     I have little doubt that this is the project of both parties. The\r\n     Austrians may perhaps put themselves a little more forward than the\r\n     Prussians; and from what I have heard of the conduct of the latter,\r\n     the enterprize may not fare the worse for this difference. The\r\n     Emperor must feel that he has now got an enemy whom he must devour,\r\n     or be devoured by it. And the governing party at Paris have very\r\n     many very obvious reasons for continuing the war. The rest of the\r\n     empire will give their contingent, unless they have been lucky\r\n     enough to be forced to sign a capitulation of neutrality. The King\r\n     of Sardinia and Italy will defend themselves as they can, which\r\n     will probably be very ill. What Spain will do, she does not know,\r\n     and therefore certainly we do not. Portugal and Holland will do\r\n     what we please. We shall do nothing. Sweden and Denmark can do\r\n     nothing, and Russia has enough else to do, and has neither the will\r\n     nor the means of doing much against France. And there is the\r\n     tableau of Europe for next year, according to my almanac.\r\n\r\n     You will not complain that this time I have not given you\r\n     speculation and prophecy enough--more than any man ought to make\r\n     who has profited, as I have done, by the experience of all these\r\n     events, to learn that human wisdom and foresight are somewhat more\r\n     shortsighted personages than the most shortsighted of us two,\r\n     whichever that is.\r\n\r\n     All my ambition is that I may at some time hereafter, when I am\r\n     freed from all active concern in such a scene as this is, have the\r\n     inexpressible satisfaction of being able to look back upon it, and\r\n     to tell myself that I have contributed to keep my own country at\r\n     least a little longer from sharing in all the evils of every sort\r\n     that surround us. I am more and more convinced that this can only\r\n     be done by keeping wholly and entirely aloof, and by watching much\r\n     at home, but doing very little indeed; endeavouring to nurse up in\r\n     the country a real determination to stand by the Constitution when\r\n     it is attacked, as it most infallibly will be if these things go\r\n     on; and, above all, trying to make the situation of the lower\r\n     orders among us as good as it can be made. In this view, I have\r\n     seen with the greatest satisfaction the steps taken in different\r\n     parts of the country for increasing wages, which I hold to be a\r\n     point of absolute necessity, and of a hundred times more importance\r\n     than all that the most _doing_ Government could do in twenty years\r\n     towards keeping the country quiet. I trust we may again be enabled\r\n     to contribute to the same object by the repeal of taxes, but of\r\n     that we cannot yet be sure. Sure I am, at least I think myself so,\r\n     that these are the best means in our power to delay what perhaps\r\n     nothing can ultimately avert, if it is decreed that we are again to\r\n     be plunged into barbarism.\r\n\r\n     I find that I am growing too serious, even for you, upon a subject\r\n     on which I know you are serious enough, and it is high time to\r\n     release you. God bless you, and thank you once more in my name, and\r\n     my little woman's, for your trees. May we long continue to love one\r\n     another as we do, and we shall both, I trust, have a comfort in our\r\n     long affection and friendship, which the study or practice of the\r\n     art of governing men seems very little likely to afford in our\r\n     time.\r\n\r\n     Ever, my dear brother,\r\n     Most affectionately yours,\r\n     GRENVILLE.\r\n\r\nThe disasters of the Duke of Brunswick reanimated the factious spirit\r\nwhich the vigorous measures of the Government had previously succeeded\r\nin subduing. The prosecutions instituted under the proclamation against\r\nseditious publications had been followed by the most decisive results;\r\nand Thomas Paine, who was the chief offender, foreseeing the inevitable\r\nissue of his impending trial, although Mr. Erskine was engaged to defend\r\nhim, had absconded to France, where he was admitted to a citizenship\r\nmore congenial to his principles, and enjoyed the doubtful honour of\r\nbeing returned by two constituencies as a member of the National\r\nAssembly.\r\n\r\nThe flight of Paine broke down the courage of his disciples; and the\r\ncirculation of seditious libels was effectually arrested, until the\r\nmisfortunes of the Allies once more revived the hopes of the\r\ndisaffected. Fresh measures of prevention and defence were now rendered\r\nnecessary to preserve the peace of the country. The Militia was to be\r\naugmented by volunteer companies, and the law officers of the Crown were\r\nto exercise with vigilance the powers entrusted to them for bringing\r\nmalcontents to justice. But it was not by such means alone the\r\nAdministration proposed to meet the evil. It appealed to the good sense\r\nand loyalty of the people. Upon these elements it depended for the\r\nultimate success of its efforts. The language of patriotism never found\r\nmore felicitous or energetic utterance than in these words of Lord\r\nGrenville's: \"The hands of Government must be strengthened if the\r\ncountry is to be saved; but, above all, the work must not be left to the\r\nhands of Government, but every man must put his shoulder to it,\r\naccording to his rank and situation in life, or it will not be done.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Whitehall, Nov. 14th, 1792.\r\n     MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     The events in Flanders have brought so much hurry of things to be\r\n     done and thought of upon me, that I really have been unable to\r\n     answer your letter, which I have been some days intending to do.\r\n     With respect to what you mention about prosecutions, you do not\r\n     advert to the forms of our laws, by which no step of that nature\r\n     can be taken by the Attorney-General, except in term time, when\r\n     alone his informations can be filed. No seditious publication has\r\n     ever come to my knowledge, without my referring it to the\r\n     Attorney-General for prosecution; and out of the five which you\r\n     mention, viz., Jockey Club, Paine, Cooper, Walker and Cartwright,\r\n     the three first have been so referred, the two last I have never\r\n     seen. In truth, without assistance from the magistrates and\r\n     gentlemen of the country, who give none except Addresses, it is\r\n     very vain for Government to attempt to see and know, at Whitehall,\r\n     every libel which may be dispersed in the country.\r\n\r\n     But the real fact is, that these people were completely quelled,\r\n     and their spirit destroyed, till the Duke of Brunswick's retreat.\r\n     Since that they have begun to show themselves again, and nothing\r\n     that I know of has been neglected that could tend to put the law in\r\n     force against them. Steps are now taking by Government to send\r\n     persons into the counties to purchase these libels, with a view to\r\n     indictments at the Christmas Quarter Sessions; but this is a thing\r\n     that can be done but once, and could not be continued without an\r\n     expense equal to that of the old French police. Our laws suppose\r\n     magistrates and Grand Juries to do this duty, and if they do it\r\n     not, I have little faith in its being done by a Government such as\r\n     the Constitution has made ours. If you look back to the last time\r\n     in our history that these sort of things bore the same serious\r\n     aspect that they now do--I mean the beginning of the Hanover\r\n     reigns--you will find that the Protestant succession was\r\n     established, not by the interference of a Secretary of State or\r\n     Attorney-General, in every individual instance, but by the\r\n     exertions of every magistrate and officer, civil or military,\r\n     throughout the country.\r\n\r\n     I wish this was more felt and understood, because it is a little\r\n     hard to be forced to run the hazards of doing much more than one's\r\n     duty, and then to be charged with doing less.\r\n\r\n     As to what you mention of overt acts, those things are all much\r\n     exaggerated, where they are not wholly groundless. The report of\r\n     what is called \"Cooper's Ass-Feast\" (Walker's I never heard of),\r\n     and of the Scotch Greys being concerned in it, reached me _by\r\n     accident_, for of all the King's good subjects, who are exclaiming\r\n     against its not being noticed, not one thought it worth his while\r\n     to apprise the Secretary of State of it. I took immediate steps for\r\n     inquiring into it, and am satisfied that the whole story has no\r\n     other foundation than Mr. Cooper having invited two officers to\r\n     dine with him in a small company, and having given them, by way of\r\n     curiosity, as a new dish, a piece of a young ass roasted. I\r\n     inquired, in the same manner, about the riot stated to have\r\n     happened at Sheffield; and learn from Lord Loughborough, who lives\r\n     in the county, and is enough on the _qui vive_ on the subject, that\r\n     there was nothing which, even in the most peaceable times, could\r\n     deserve the name of a riot. That supposed at Perth I never heard of\r\n     yet, though Dundas has been within a short distance of that place.\r\n\r\n     It is not unnatural, nor is it an unfavourable symptom, that people\r\n     who are thoroughly frightened, as the body of landed gentlemen in\r\n     this country are, should exaggerate these stories as they pass from\r\n     one mouth to the other; but you, who know the course of this sort\r\n     of reports, ought not too hastily to give credit to them.\r\n\r\n     It is, however, not the less true that the danger exists, and\r\n     perhaps not the less from its not breaking out in the manner\r\n     stated. The conquest of Flanders has, as I believe, brought the\r\n     business to a much nearer issue here than any reasonable man could\r\n     believe a month ago. The hands of Government must be strengthened\r\n     if the country is to be saved; but, above all, the work must not be\r\n     left to the hands of Government, but every man must put his\r\n     shoulder to it, according to his rank and situation in life, or it\r\n     will not be done. I could write much more of the same sort, but I\r\n     have already people waiting for me.\r\n\r\n     Ever most affectionately yours,\r\n     G.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Whitehall, Nov. 25th, 1792.\r\n     MY DEAREST BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     Our hopes of anything really useful from Opposition, are, I am\r\n     sorry to say, nearly vanished. In the meantime the storm thickens.\r\n     Lord Loughborough has declined, and Fox seems to govern the rest\r\n     just in the old way.\r\n\r\n     We are called upon on all sides for counter associations, and\r\n     indeed it seems too clear that the peace of the country cannot\r\n     otherwise be preserved. The army, though I trust still steady, is\r\n     too small to be depended on. We must look to individual exertions,\r\n     and to the Militia. I forgot to beg you to state to me the grounds\r\n     you had to think parts of that body infected. It is material to\r\n     know the truth on that subject. Our plan is to enable the King to\r\n     authorize the Lord-Lieutenants to commission volunteer companies to\r\n     be added to the Militia on the first appearance of tumult. This\r\n     seems to add the advantage of subordination to regular power to\r\n     that of association.\r\n\r\n     In the meantime, we are preparing an association in London, which\r\n     is to be declared in the course of next week. I enclose you the\r\n     plan of their declaration, in which you see the great object is to\r\n     confine it within the limits of the regular Government, and not to\r\n     go beyond that point. A few persons of rank cannot be kept out of\r\n     it, but we mean it chiefly to consist of merchants and lawyers, as\r\n     a London society, and that the example should then be followed by\r\n     each county or district--including there as many farmers and yeomen\r\n     as possible. In this _we_ shall of course have no difficulty.\r\n     Probably we need hardly appear much before the Quarter Sessions. It\r\n     seems desirable that at the different Quarter Sessions the\r\n     magistrates should name an adjourned day for receiving the reports\r\n     of their different constables, &c., &c., relative to the state of\r\n     their districts in this respect, and taking the necessary measures\r\n     thereupon.\r\n\r\n     I throw out these ideas to you for your consideration, as it is now\r\n     clear I cannot see you before Saturday, if then. If I cannot leave\r\n     town I will let you know in time.\r\n\r\n     Ever yours,\r\n     G.\r\n\r\n     I really have not time to extract for you a state of the Austrian\r\n     and Prussian armies. Both Courts are making the utmost possible\r\n     exertions to march down fresh troops. But then, I apprehend, the\r\n     amazing superiority of numbers must keep them on the defensive,\r\n     unless they can cut off Custine, of which I have little hope.\r\n\r\n     I am delighted with the spirit and feeling of your son's letter,\r\n     which are, I hope of the best augury, with a view to a game in\r\n     which he will probably be called upon to play his part pretty soon.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Whitehall, Nov. 29th, 1792.\r\n     MY DEAREST BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     As we have, I think, nearly determined that, in consequence of the\r\n     situation of affairs, both at home and abroad, we cannot discharge\r\n     our duty to the country, nor even answer for its security, without\r\n     calling the whole or a considerable part of the Militia\r\n     immediately, I lose not a moment in apprizing you of it, both that\r\n     you may be enabled to hold yourself in readiness to take your\r\n     measures, and also to beg you to suggest to me any particular of\r\n     importance that may occur to you respecting the mode of doing the\r\n     thing.\r\n\r\n     Parliament must, as you know, by law be assembled within fourteen\r\n     days; and it will, I think, be so within twelve days of the\r\n     proclamation, which I expect to issue on Friday. But the precise\r\n     day is not yet determined, because we are desirous, before the\r\n     thing is known, to have troops enough round London to prevent the\r\n     possibility of anything happening in the interval, which they would\r\n     of course try if they saw an opening.\r\n\r\n     You must not, from this measure, think the alarm greater than it\r\n     is. The step is principally founded on the total inadequacy of our\r\n     military force to the necessary exertions.\r\n\r\n     At the time that the order is sent, directions will be given to\r\n     the Lord-Lieutenant immediately to assemble the serjeants, &c., and\r\n     to place the arms under proper guard. I am, as you will easily\r\n     believe, too much hurried to be able to go into more details.\r\n\r\n     We have nothing new from abroad.\r\n\r\n     Ever most affectionately yours,\r\n     G.\r\n\r\n     I am afraid all visits to Dropmore are quite out of the question.\r\n\r\n     I do not understand what you say in one of your letters about\r\n     quarters instead of lodging.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Saturday, Dec. 1st, 1792.\r\n     MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     The King's orders are this day given to embody the two-thirds of\r\n     all the Militias of the counties on the east coast from Scotland to\r\n     London, which, together with Cumberland, Westmoreland and Kent,\r\n     give us a strength of about five thousand one hundred men.\r\n\r\n     Parliament will meet on Thursday sev'nnight. Before that time, I\r\n     conclude I shall see you here. I am really so occupied, as not to\r\n     have a moment to spare.\r\n\r\n     Dumourier is advancing towards Liege; and I think if some blow is\r\n     not already struck by their small force from Ostend against\r\n     Flushing, the season secures Holland for some months, during which\r\n     much must happen of all sorts.\r\n\r\n     We have, I trust, secured the Tower and the City, and have now\r\n     reason to believe that they are alarmed, and have put off their\r\n     intended visit; but we are prepared for the worst.\r\n\r\n     Ever yours,\r\n     G.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Whitehall, Dec. 5th, 1792.\r\n     MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     We determined last night to call out, in addition to the regiments\r\n     already ordered, the Militias of the maritime counties from Kent to\r\n     Cornwall, inclusive, and those of Berks, Bucks, Herts, and Surrey.\r\n     You will, in consequence, receive by this messenger the warrant and\r\n     letter for that purpose. The reason of the addition is partly the\r\n     increasing prospect of hostilities with France, and partly the\r\n     motives stated in your letter. Our object at first was to limit the\r\n     number, in order not to give too great an alarm. The spirit of the\r\n     people is evidently rising, and I trust that we shall have energy\r\n     enough in the country to enable the Government to assert its true\r\n     situation in Europe, and to maintain its dignity.\r\n\r\n     We shall certainly proceed to business on Thursday; but how long we\r\n     shall sit, it is impossible as yet to decide. I think the present\r\n     idea is to bring forward the bills immediately which are necessary\r\n     for strengthening the hands of Government. Hitherto, we have every\r\n     reason to be satisfied with the impression our measure has made.\r\n\r\n     Ever most affectionately yours,\r\n     G.\r\n\r\nParliament stood prorogued to the 3rd of January; but it was convened by\r\nproclamation on the 3rd of December, in consequence of the urgent\r\nnecessity that existed for adopting immediate measures of internal\r\ndefence. On the 17th, Lord Grenville introduced his Alien Bill; and two\r\nother measures were rapidly passed for interdicting the circulation of\r\nFrench assignats, and preventing the exportation of naval stores and\r\nammunition.\r\n\r\nThe signs of the future were now darkening the horizon. The French\r\nRepublic sent over an ambassador extraordinary, under the title of\r\nMinister Plenipotentiary, to demand of England whether France was to\r\nconsider her as a neutral or a hostile power. Lord Grenville refused to\r\nnegotiate with him in a character which England could not acknowledge;\r\nbut intimated that if France was desirous of maintaining peace with\r\nGreat Britain, she must renounce her views of aggression and\r\naggrandizement, and confine herself to her own territory, without\r\ninsulting other Governments, without disturbing their tranquillity,\r\nwithout violating their rights.\r\n\r\nThe sequel need not be detailed. The King of France was brought to\r\ntrial, sentenced to death, and beheaded. This terrible catastrophe\r\nterminated the mission of the French Ambassador, who was informed by\r\nLord Grenville that he could no longer remain in this kingdom in a\r\npublic character, and ordered to retire within eight days. In a week\r\nfrom that time, the Convention passed a decree declaring the Republic of\r\nFrance at war with the King of England and the Stadtholder of Holland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1793.\r\n\r\nCAUSES AND OBJECTS OF THE WAR--SECESSIONS FROM THE OPPOSITION--REVERSES\r\nIN HOLLAND--DISASTERS OF THE ALLIES--STATE OF FRANCE AT THE CLOSE OF THE\r\nYEAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe policy of England in reference to the proceedings in France had\r\nhitherto been that of a conservative neutrality. The letter of Lord\r\nGrenville to the Marquis of Buckingham, dated 7th November, 1792, to\r\nwhich attention has been specially directed, clearly and unequivocally\r\nestablishes that fact. Had the motive commonly imputed to Ministers, of\r\nhaving entered into the war for the vindication of the monarchical\r\nprinciple and the restoration of the Bourbons, been really the actuating\r\nobject, it would have appeared in these confidential communications. Not\r\nonly, however, is there no such motive avowed or contemplated, but, on\r\nthe contrary, Lord Grenville declares that the greatest source of pride\r\nand satisfaction he finds on reviewing the line of conduct he had acted\r\nupon throughout that reign of anarchy, is in the reflection that he had\r\nkept England out of it. Up to the last moment, so long as France\r\nconfined her public acts and the dissemination of her new doctrines to\r\nher own territory, the English Government remained merely a spectator of\r\nevents in which she took no part, and evinced no concern. The case was\r\naltered when France invaded Holland, and passed a decree fraternizing\r\nwith the people of other countries, and offering them assistance to\r\nprocure their liberties. These were the measures of oppression and\r\naggrandizement referred to by Lord Grenville in his communications with\r\nthe French Envoy; and upon these grounds, and these grounds alone,\r\nEngland accepted and prosecuted the war.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the declaration of hostilities by the Convention, the\r\nKing sent a message to Parliament explicitly declaring the causes of the\r\nwar, which were, the occupation by the French of the Scheldt, the\r\nexclusive navigation of which had been guaranteed by treaty to the\r\nDutch; the fraternizing decree which invited the people of other\r\ncountries to revolutionize their Governments; and the danger with which\r\nEurope was threatened by the progress of the French arms. In one aspect\r\nthis was a war of principles; in another, it was a war of self-defence.\r\nIn both, it was just and inevitable. Even the Opposition admitted the\r\nvalidity of the grounds on which it proceeded, although they could not\r\nresist the temptation of assailing the Minister, while they adopted his\r\nmeasures. The resolutions founded on the message were carried with\r\nscarcely a shadow of objection in either House of Parliament. The people\r\nof all classes were wholly with Mr. Pitt. Amongst the last to be\r\nconvinced was Mr. Wilberforce, who had a moral aversion to all wars,\r\nbut who ultimately expressed himself converted to the necessity of war\r\non this occasion.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the message from the King was remarkable. Numbers of the\r\nmost influential men, who had previously voted with the Opposition,\r\npassed over to the Ministerial benches, including Burke and Wyndham, and\r\nthe Lords Portland, Spencer, Fitzwilliam, Loughborough, and many other\r\npeers and commoners. Lord Loughborough, who had so often run in couples\r\nwith Thurlow, was now appointed to succeed him on the Woolsack; and\r\nMinisters, acquiring augmented strength from all quarters, addressed\r\nthemselves vigorously to the task of preparation.\r\n\r\nThe letters of this year are scanty, but not unimportant, in their\r\nreferences to passing events. Taken in connection with the history of\r\nthe period, which is too familiar to require any further elucidation,\r\nthey will be found to throw a new light upon some points of contemporary\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Whitehall, Jan. 19th, 1793.\r\n     MY DEAREST BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     It is at length settled that Lord Loughborough shall take the Seals\r\n     on Wednesday. He has written a long letter to the Duke of Portland,\r\n     which has not been answered. It is as yet very difficult to say\r\n     what proportion of the _ci-devant_ Opposition will follow Lord\r\n     Loughborough's example, and join Government avowedly, but I am\r\n     inclined to hope a pretty large one. The Prince of Wales has also\r\n     written to the Duke of Portland, and sent a message to us,\r\n     declaring his intention to join Government. I have not seen the\r\n     letter, but _my informant_, to whom it was shown yesterday morning\r\n     by the Duke of York, told me it was proper and explicit.\r\n\r\n     424 against the referring the judgment to the Assemblees Primaires,\r\n     283 for it.\r\n\r\n     The first question, of guilty, decided almost unanimously; the\r\n     third, that punishment should be inflicted, was deferred to the\r\n     10th.\r\n\r\n     Brissot's report, which you will see in the French papers, seems\r\n     well enough calculated for our purpose. The thing must now come to\r\n     its point in a few days; and we shall, I trust, have appeared to\r\n     the public here to have put the French completely _dans leur tort_.\r\n\r\n     Ever most affectionately yours,\r\n     G.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Whitehall, June 12th, 1793.\r\n     MY DEAREST BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     In consequence of what you requested in the conversation we had at\r\n     Dropmore, I write to mention to you that the vacant Ribands are\r\n     to-day to be given to Lord Salisbury, Lord Westmoreland, and Lord\r\n     Carlisle. I did not learn this yesterday till it was too late to\r\n     write to you. With respect to what you mentioned to me of your own\r\n     intentions, you know too well what my opinion is, and how anxiously\r\n     I am impressed with that opinion, to make me feel it right to urge\r\n     you with what could only be a repetition of all I have already\r\n     stated. But I wish to make it my earnest request to you that you\r\n     will not take any actual step till you have seen Pitt. I have not\r\n     told him anything of your idea of taking any measure on this\r\n     occasion but I have stated to him in general terms the uneasiness\r\n     you still seemed to feel on the subject of the former request, and\r\n     the possibility that this impression might be strengthened,\r\n     supposing Lord Camden's death to produce that sort of arrangement\r\n     to which you had so handsomely consented, but which might,\r\n     nevertheless, bring the other idea more forward in your mind.\r\n\r\n     His plan was (if he had not been hindered by the gout) to have run\r\n     down to Somersetshire for a week, at the close of the business in\r\n     the House of Commons, and to have been back before he could almost\r\n     be known to be gone. He had then intended to take Winchester in his\r\n     way. I have not seen him for several days, and cannot therefore say\r\n     whether this idea still holds, but at all events there could be no\r\n     difficulty in your coming to town for a day or two for that\r\n     purpose.\r\n\r\n     I urge this because I know you may fully rely upon his friendship,\r\n     and that even if he should not be able to alter the thing itself,\r\n     which I am sure I know not how he can, it is still, in my opinion,\r\n     very desirable that you should not take so marked a step without\r\n     hearing the advice of those who love you best, supposing even that\r\n     after all you should not be influenced by their reasoning upon it.\r\n\r\n     I say nothing about myself in all this, because I am sure you\r\n     believe me truly sensible of your constant and unvaried affection\r\n     to me, and unwilling to intrude upon you repetitions which I must\r\n     fear would be useless. But you will not attribute it to\r\n     indifference or unconcern about the thing itself, which, God knows,\r\n     are sentiments the reverse of what I feel upon it.\r\n\r\n     We have no news of any material event at the army. The siege was to\r\n     be opened on Monday, and they seem to entertain very sanguine ideas\r\n     indeed as to its speedy success. I have some doubt whether the\r\n     report from Paris, respecting Marat's new revolution, is to be\r\n     credited, though all the late accounts from thence seemed to\r\n     indicate an approaching crisis. I have a confused account from the\r\n     Hague, of the Duke of Brunswick having gained a decisive advantage\r\n     over the army that was Custine's. But it is not distinct enough to\r\n     place much reliance upon it.\r\n\r\n     Mudge is returned by the way of China with despatches from\r\n     Vancouver. I have not yet seen them, but I understand, generally,\r\n     that some difficulty arose about the restitution of Northa. It is\r\n     not, however, of a nature to create any real embarrassment. He has\r\n     brought a letter for poor Lady Camelford from her son, whom he\r\n     tells me he left in great health and spirits. We have not opened\r\n     it, but wait till Lord C. comes, which I hope will be about the end\r\n     of this month at latest. From what he says, Vancouver's expedition\r\n     is likely to continue so much longer, that I think of proposing to\r\n     Lady C. that her son should return by the first opportunity, in\r\n     order to go into some larger ship, which at his age now will\r\n     clearly be desirable. He will have served his time before he can\r\n     hear from Europe. Juan de Fuca's inlet is explored, and found to be\r\n     closed with high lands.\r\n\r\n     Ever most affectionately yours,\r\n     G.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     St. James's Square, Sept. 11th, 1793.\r\n     MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     I am sorry to acquaint you that we have unpleasant accounts from\r\n     the army, and the more unpleasant from their uncertainty. All that\r\n     seems to be certain is, that the Duke of York thought himself\r\n     obliged to raise the siege of Dunkirk, at least for the present, in\r\n     consequence of an attack which I imagine to have taken place on the\r\n     evening of the 7th; and which must, of course, have been bloody,\r\n     and the event unfavourable to us. We have no direct account from\r\n     the army, but the report is that of an officer of the navy, who\r\n     comes, I understand, from Nieuport, and states that he had\r\n     prevented any other letters from coming over, in order to prevent\r\n     the spreading an alarm till the official accounts arrive.\r\n\r\n     There is also a letter from Watson, the Commissary-General, which\r\n     seems to confirm the intended retreat, and says that he has\r\n     provisions, &c., enough in the rear of the army; but he mentions no\r\n     particulars of what has happened, except that he says the spirit of\r\n     the troops is good--that they have suffered, but have not been\r\n     beaten. His letter is from Furnes, on the 8th.\r\n\r\n     I am sorry for the suspense in which this must leave you, as it\r\n     does us. If we hear more before the post goes out, I will add a\r\n     line to this letter.\r\n\r\n     Ever most affectionately yours,\r\n     G.\r\n\r\n     I should have added, that the same officer brings the account that\r\n     they had got at Ostend of the capture of Quesnoy, which I credit,\r\n     because my last letters from the Austrian army state the fall of\r\n     that place as certain within a very few days. This is the more\r\n     important, as P. Cob. would then be at liberty to march towards\r\n     Flanders, if necessary.\r\n\r\n     Since I wrote the above, I have seen the narrative of the officer\r\n     in question--Lieutenant Popham. It is long, and full of little\r\n     details; but the result of the whole is, that he was going, by\r\n     Macbride's orders, to communicate with the Duke of York, and turned\r\n     back on account of the news he heard; that he met on the road\r\n     parties of our cavalry _evacuating Furnes_ on the 8th, and many\r\n     wounded soldiers going to Ostend; but he does not appear to have\r\n     collected accounts of what had happened, and indeed it is most\r\n     probable that individuals could not give any general information.\r\n     It does not appear whether they were going from Furnes by orders or\r\n     not.\r\n\r\n     Five, P.M.\r\n\r\n     I have just got the enclosed letter to Bruges from a young man I\r\n     sent as Secretary to Sir James Murray; and as it is very doubtful\r\n     whether I shall get the particulars time enough to send you\r\n     anything further, I would not omit letting you have this, which\r\n     will at least put you at ease for individuals. You will observe it\r\n     is dated from Furnes, on the 9th. It is brought by an officer\r\n     charged with the despatches.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Dropmore, Sept. 15th, 1793. At Night.\r\n     MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     You will receive with this letter, which will be sent you from\r\n     London, the good and the bad accounts together. For the Flanders\r\n     war, I fear the latter overbalance the former; there is, however,\r\n     in my opinion, very little reason to be discouraged at these\r\n     checks, which must be expected whenever the French took the\r\n     resolution to leave the sieges on the side of Hainault to their\r\n     fate, in order to break in upon the line of communication. This\r\n     must have happened equally if the combined armies had remained\r\n     together, and undertaken a joint operation; and the proposed plan\r\n     had the advantage of being the only one whose success would have\r\n     remedied this inconvenience, resulting from the nature of an attack\r\n     from an open country against such a barrier.\r\n\r\n     It must be left to military decision what is precisely the best\r\n     point of attack, combined or separate, which now remains; but the\r\n     loss of Menin as a post of communication does not tend to lessen\r\n     the difficulties of any plan, and I am decidedly averse to anything\r\n     that shall hazard the delaying the West India expedition, for\r\n     which, when you consider how much is to be done there, you will not\r\n     think a whole season too much.\r\n\r\n     After all, a few towns more or less in Flanders are certainly not\r\n     unimportant; but I am much mistaken in my speculation, if the\r\n     business at Toulon is not decisive of the war. Only let your own\r\n     mind follow up all the consequences of that event, and you will, I\r\n     believe, agree with me that the expression I have used is not too\r\n     sanguine. We have news that the people of Lyons have defeated\r\n     Dubois Cranee, with a loss to the latter, as it is said, of four\r\n     thousand men. Allow this to be exaggerated, as I suppose it is, but\r\n     take the fact to be true that he has been defeated, and it is\r\n     everything to us. The next month or six weeks will be an anxious\r\n     period, and big with events.\r\n\r\n     You asked me some time ago about Parliament, and that with a view\r\n     to your own motions. Nothing can, of course, be absolutely fixed on\r\n     that subject; but I think it highly improbable that Parliament\r\n     should meet before January. I heartily wish that we may arrange it\r\n     so as to meet, though in the present moment I should be afraid even\r\n     of such a distance as Stowe. At all events, when your camp breaks\r\n     up, I trust you will take Dropmore in your way, as indeed I believe\r\n     it will lay directly in your road, if you come by town, and not far\r\n     out of it, if you go straight to Stowe.\r\n\r\n     My dear wife desires best love to you and Lady B. Lady Camelford\r\n     is, I think, better than we could have hoped.\r\n\r\n     Ever most affectionately yours,\r\n     G.\r\n\r\n     16th.\r\n\r\n     This ought to have gone to-day, and I am sorry to find it this\r\n     evening in one of my boxes here. We have nothing new to-day, except\r\n     the account of the murder of the King of Poland, which is believed.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Walmer Castle, Oct. 1st, 1793.\r\n     MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     Your letter of the 27th followed me here yesterday, and I have just\r\n     received that of the 29th. With respect to the first, I can only\r\n     say that I have by this post sent your letters to Pitt, and am very\r\n     sure that if it depends on him, what you wish will be done.\r\n\r\n     Lord Amherst's answer of the reduced state of the regiments at home\r\n     is, however, surely not quite so much out of the way as you state\r\n     it. It is a great pity that your _protege_ is in Canada, where no\r\n     promotion can be going forward, and from whence, I conclude, he\r\n     cannot be brought into regiments upon actual service. Sir C. Grey\r\n     conveyed to me the other day a wish to know whether there was any\r\n     officer in his army that I felt interested about; but I know of\r\n     none that I should think it worth laying myself under an obligation\r\n     for. If Talbot had happened to be in one of the regiments in Nova\r\n     Scotia, he would probably have been in this predicament; but I\r\n     suppose the force in Canada is little likely to be weakened, in the\r\n     present state of America.\r\n\r\n     I am delighted to find that you are so well pleased with the\r\n     manifesto. I have hardly had time yet to consider your observations\r\n     on the particular passages you have marked, but I will do so, and\r\n     am much obliged to you for the trouble.\r\n\r\n     The Duke of Richmond will, I am persuaded, not resign in the\r\n     present moment, though he has been talking and doing foolishly. As\r\n     far as I can learn, there is no sort of ground for the accusation\r\n     of delay on his part relative to Dunkirk. When I see you, I can\r\n     _say_ on that subject what for many reasons I do not choose to\r\n     write. _Au reste_, the Duke of Richmond's campaign seems completely\r\n     to have annihilated the little popularity he ever had; and though I\r\n     am satisfied he will not resign till after the meeting of\r\n     Parliament, and perhaps till after the session is over, I am\r\n     equally persuaded he will not continue another year in the Cabinet.\r\n\r\n     We are sending Hessians to Toulon, and shall soon have there a\r\n     really respectable force; the interval is the only thing to be\r\n     feared; but Mulgrave's being there is a great comfort to me; as\r\n     great, indeed, _entre nous_, as if I knew the new Governor was\r\n     actually arrived there. We have nothing like force enough for all\r\n     the objects that present themselves, and you know my settled\r\n     aversion to undertaking little points of detail; some of which\r\n     might succeed, but the result of the whole must be to cut to pieces\r\n     the small force we have, without adequate success. Besides this,\r\n     the reliance on the dispositions of the country, with the single\r\n     exception of Toulon, pressed as it was by famine at one door, and\r\n     the guillotine at the other, has always failed us.\r\n\r\n     I believe it is true, that almost in every part of France they\r\n     detest the Convention, but that they are quite incapable of giving\r\n     any solid footing in the country.\r\n\r\n     Ever yours most affectionately,\r\n     G.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM\r\n\r\n     Walmer Castle, Oct. 11th, 1793.\r\n     MY DEAREST BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     I was just going to write to you when I received your letter. My\r\n     present plans are to return to town about Tuesday next, and to get\r\n     to Dropmore by dinner on Friday, if possible; but I would not wish\r\n     you to let _your_ dinner depend on that. I conclude, from what you\r\n     say of your having been reviewed, that you will be able to get away\r\n     soon, and it will be a great gratification to us both to see you,\r\n     especially if, as I hope, Lady Buckingham comes with you. Lady\r\n     Camelford writes to Anne that she much wishes to see you, and if\r\n     she knows of the time of your coming will endeavour to contrive to\r\n     be with us. I return you Freemantle's letter, for fear of\r\n     accidents. You have, perhaps, guessed that it anticipates part of\r\n     what I had to say to you, but I hope you have also felt the\r\n     singularly embarrassing situation in which the King's Ministers are\r\n     placed in this respect, with the cause of Royalty to defend, and\r\n     with the great obligations they owe to the extreme liberality and\r\n     honour of the King's conduct towards them. They are obliged,\r\n     therefore, to say nothing, and to let nothing be said: and indeed I\r\n     hardly know what I should wish to be said, so great is the\r\n     difficulty in all respects. I know I may reckon upon your\r\n     discretion, not only in saying nothing from me, but also in saying\r\n     as little as possible from yourself, which would not fail to be\r\n     repeated, and to be ascribed to me. We will talk this over fully\r\n     when I see you, and I really much wish to know what you think ought\r\n     ultimately to be done on the subject. You will have seen that it is\r\n     not the camp of Mauberge, but the advanced posts that had been\r\n     unsuccessfully attacked. The attack of the camp itself was to take\r\n     place somewhere about this time, and yesterday the British troops\r\n     marched to Cysoing, where they thought it not improbable they might\r\n     be engaged with the French, who are collecting at Bouchain and\r\n     Cambray.\r\n\r\n     George Nugent had written to me twice on the subject of his\r\n     proposal, and I sent him Lord Amherst's answer, which is negative,\r\n     at least for the present. He seems to have an invincible aversion\r\n     to new corps, I fancy, from all the badgering he got upon that\r\n     subject last war. He now states only the plea of seniority, that\r\n     the number intended to be raised is filled up by older\r\n     Lieutenant-Colonels. I fancy Nugent had not received my letter when\r\n     he wrote to you.\r\n\r\n     The language of the Convention looks as if some serious attack\r\n     might be expected here; serious at least as they intend it, but\r\n     ridiculous, I trust, it will prove. An attempt in force requires\r\n     preparations they have not, and a superiority in naval force which\r\n     they certainly have not. Buccaneering expeditions I take to be\r\n     practicable, with only the certainty of much greater loss to\r\n     themselves than to us. They would be unpleasant in their effect\r\n     here, but what help.\r\n\r\n     I have profited of your advice about the manifesto, and now send\r\n     you the English translation which I have prepared, with the\r\n     transpositions you recommended. I do not think it reads as well in\r\n     English as in French, which I am sorry for, as it must be read in\r\n     English by John Bull, whose approbation of my writings I should\r\n     like to retain. I hardly know how to ask you to correct, as it must\r\n     be a translation, and a literal one. But mark what you dislike, and\r\n     I will try if, retaining the translation, it can be altered. I have\r\n     kept _guerre defensive_ and that _pour cause_: which indeed you may\r\n     guess, when you see in the papers that His Prussian Majesty is\r\n     returned to Berlin, and when I tell you that we had no previous\r\n     notice of his journey.\r\n\r\n     Ever most affectionately yours,\r\n     G.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     St. James's Square, Nov. 21st, 1793.\r\n     MY DEAREST BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     I had already spoken to Pitt upon the idea of G. Nugent's being\r\n     appointed one of the aides-de-camp, if the promotion mentioned by\r\n     him should take place. I have reason to be sure, that for the\r\n     present no idea exists of that promotion. If it had, I should\r\n     certainly have pressed his declining the offer of the corps;\r\n     because, though that is no absolute bar according to any rule, yet\r\n     it may, certainly, in the King's mind, stand in his way; and such\r\n     exceptions as Lord Chenton and Lord Rawdon do not prove much. I am\r\n     very confident, that, as it is, whatever can be done by Pitt will\r\n     be done, if the promotion should hereafter take place; but I am\r\n     sure you know that the King's Ministers do not name his\r\n     aides-de-camp; and that the pressing such a request, beyond a\r\n     certain point, makes difficulties in his mind, instead of removing\r\n     them. Besides his wish to oblige you, Pitt is personally\r\n     well-disposed towards Nugent, and I have reason to think that Lord\r\n     Amherst is so too.\r\n\r\n     Sir James Murray will, I think, not continue in his present\r\n     situation; and the mode of removing him, will probably be by\r\n     putting him at the head of some corps; but this is not yet\r\n     mentioned to him, and, therefore, I rely on your not speaking of it\r\n     to any one else. I do not know whether, in that case, the King will\r\n     fill up his place as aide-de-camp, or not; but one vacancy cannot\r\n     be expected to make room for Nugent, who is at the end of his year;\r\n     besides, the natural claim which Manners has on the King. It is,\r\n     therefore, I think, better on the whole, that Nugent should go on\r\n     with his corps.\r\n\r\n     With respect to your lesser army jobs, I say nothing about them,\r\n     because I really do not understand them, and am unable to judge of\r\n     the facility or difficulty of Lord Amherst's complying with them.\r\n     It is useless for me to talk about Pitt's share in all this, though\r\n     I certainly do not think it very fair that he should bear on his\r\n     shoulders all the grievances of cornetcies and lieutenancies, which\r\n     Lord Amherst or any other Commander-in-chief is sure to create.\r\n\r\n     I have spoken about the _precis_, and you will certainly have them\r\n     whenever there is news to send. The army is safe, and I hope quiet,\r\n     in its winter quarters. Lord Moira sets out to-morrow morning, and\r\n     will find everything ready for him at Portsmouth. You see how right\r\n     you was about the impossibility of keeping secret at Portsmouth the\r\n     new destination of this force. Luckily, it is so ready, that the\r\n     thing itself will take place even now as soon as the news can reach\r\n     Paris.\r\n\r\n     Lord Malmesbury is going to Berlin, to bring our good ally to a\r\n     point--ay or no. I think it will end in no.\r\n\r\n     I certainly will not forget my engagement; and I still hope we\r\n     shall find a Saturday and Sunday for Stowe.\r\n\r\n     God bless you, my dear brother, and believe me\r\n\r\n     Ever most affectionately yours,\r\n     G.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     St. James's Square, Dec. 12th, 1793.\r\n     MY DEAREST BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     At your request, I certainly will do a thing extremely disagreeable\r\n     to myself, by putting into Mr. Pitt's hands the letter you desire\r\n     me to show him. In any case where _you_ or _yours_ could have the\r\n     smallest interest, I should never consider whether a compliance\r\n     with your wishes is or is not pleasant to me; but I freely own,\r\n     that I hardly think you would be repaid, by Mr. Pigott's getting\r\n     his company, for the uneasiness I feel in being made (unprofitably,\r\n     too, as I think, even to the object) the channel of such a\r\n     communication between two persons whom I have so much reason to\r\n     love and value.\r\n\r\n     The accounts of the Duke of Brunswick's victory, though they have\r\n     not come to us from any channel that we can consider as strictly\r\n     official, are such as to leave no doubt of the fact. There appears\r\n     to have been different actions for three days, from the 29th of\r\n     November to the 1st of December; and on the last of these days the\r\n     victory was obtained, which persons, pretty well informed, seem to\r\n     consider as decisive of the fate of Landan. The great object of the\r\n     French was to relieve that place, and surround Wurmser; and in both\r\n     they have failed, having been repulsed in a last attack they made\r\n     on the latter the 1st instant. It appears likely now that little\r\n     more will be done on that frontier till Landan is obliged to\r\n     surrender; nor anything after that.\r\n\r\n     All our expectations are turned towards Brittany; but the news from\r\n     that quarter is by no means favourable, as far as it goes. The\r\n     Royalist army appears unable to make any siege, or even to continue\r\n     twenty-four hours in the same place; and this for want of\r\n     provisions. There is, besides, among them much disunion, and a\r\n     total want of discipline; and they seemed to have formed the\r\n     resolution of retiring inwards into France. Whether they will be\r\n     deterred from this by the communications since made to them, and by\r\n     the knowledge of our force being actually at their doors, remains\r\n     to be seen.\r\n\r\n     I did not send you the account of the failure of all our hopes,\r\n     from Lord Howe. I was not in town; and if I had been, I do not know\r\n     whether I was not too much vexed to write. He is still off Ushant;\r\n     so that the idea of sending out the second fleet is, for the\r\n     moment, at least, out of the question. Some of those ships are, as\r\n     you know, destined for other services; and the whole, without Lord\r\n     Howe, would not be strong enough to meet the Brest fleet; and with\r\n     him, would be much too strong.\r\n\r\n     The business of St. Domingo is highly important. The possession of\r\n     the Mole, though not beyond what we had looked to, is much beyond\r\n     my hopes. Dansey's letter to Williamson expresses much confidence\r\n     of maintaining himself there, with such a force, as I trust, by\r\n     this time, and long before, he actually has there.\r\n\r\n     Ever most affectionately yours,\r\n     G.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the year France was stronger than at the commencement.\r\nThe destruction of her navy at Toulon was the principal reverse she\r\nsuffered. On the other side the allies had encountered defeat at almost\r\nevery point; the Prussians compelled to retreat to Mentz, the\r\nImperialists driven beyond the Rhine, and the English forced to raise\r\nthe siege of Dunkirk. The enthusiasm of the masses, sustained by these\r\nsuccesses, and acted upon by the popular appeals of the Jacobins, placed\r\nat the disposal of the Republic an enormous physical force, which the\r\nwhole winter was occupied in augmenting and organizing for the campaigns\r\nof the ensuing year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1794.\r\n\r\nPREPARATIONS IN ENGLAND FOR THE PROSECUTION OF THE WAR--INACTIVITY OF\r\nTHE AUSTRIANS--LORD SPENCER AND MR. THOMAS GRENVILLE SENT ON A MISSION\r\nTO VIENNA--HOSTILE RESOLUTIONS OF THE OPPOSITION--SEVERAL OF THE LEADING\r\nWHIGS JOIN THE ADMINISTRATION--LORD CORNWALLIS APPOINTED TO THE COMMAND\r\nON THE CONTINENT--PROGRESS OF THE NEGOTIATIONS--LORD FITZWILLIAM\r\nNOMINATED TO THE LORD-LIEUTENANCY OF IRELAND--HIS CONDUCT ON THAT\r\nOCCASION.\r\n\r\n\r\nParliament was convened on the 21st of January, 1794; and the Speech\r\nfrom the Throne expressed a sanguine hope on the part of His Majesty\r\nthat the resources of France would be speedily exhausted. There was\r\ncertainly little in the operations of the last year upon which the\r\ncountry could be congratulated; and the only remaining encouragement\r\nthat could be held out was in reference to the future. The prodigious\r\nexertions of the Republic undoubtedly justified the expectation, that\r\nshe could not long continue to meet the increasing demands which the\r\nextension of the war was making upon her means and energies; but it was\r\ndifficult, in the heat and excitement of the conflict, to form an\r\nadequate estimate of the devotion with which the French were prepared\r\nto follow up their successes. A series of fortunate incidents and some\r\nbrilliant achievements had inflamed the national vanity to such a height\r\nof exultation as to produce a perfect military mania in all parts of the\r\ncountry; and when Mr. Pitt, in the course of the opening debate,\r\ndeclared that \"France had been converted into an armed nation,\"--an\r\nexpression that elicited much criticism at the time--he described\r\naccurately the exact state of the people, and the lengths they were\r\nprepared to go in the assertion of the principles they had baptized in\r\nthe blood of the Sovereign.\r\n\r\nThere were not wanting persons in England who sympathized with the\r\nrepublicans of France, and regarded their martial spirit with something\r\nof the admiration which the impassioned and the thoughtless bestow upon\r\ngallantry and heroism. But the bulk of the nation entertained a\r\ndifferent opinion, and viewed with alarm and detestation the sanguinary\r\nexcesses by which the war was initiated and sustained. While the former\r\nclass, few in number, and confined chiefly to the lowest dregs of the\r\npopulation, continued to give occupation to the Government at home, the\r\nlatter were ready to make any sacrifices the exigency of circumstances\r\nrequired to support the policy of the Government abroad.\r\n\r\nParliament unanimously voted an augmentation of eighty-five thousand men\r\nto the navy, and sixty thousand to the army. Ample preparations in other\r\nrespects were made for the approaching operations; and, amongst the\r\nextraordinary measures resorted to, arrangements were made for\r\naugmenting the Militia, and raising voluntary subscriptions for the\r\nmaintenance of the war. The spirit of the country was awakened to the\r\ndefence of those constitutional principles which presented the surest\r\nsafeguard for the public liberties; and the delusions which at first had\r\nseized upon the factious and discontented rapidly vanished as the war\r\nadvanced. Success alone was wanted to confirm the confidence of the\r\npeople; but as yet the genius and headlong valour of France was in the\r\nascendant, and the solid endurance of England was doomed to a long and\r\nharassing term of fluctuating fortunes.\r\n\r\nThe Correspondence traces some of the principal events of the year; and\r\nmaps out in advance the plans and difficulties of Ministers, by which we\r\nare admitted, so to speak, to the deliberations of the Cabinet upon\r\nnearly every fresh exigency that arose in the course of the campaigns.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. T. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Charles Street, Jan. 1st, 1794.\r\n     MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     I had no sooner received your letter, than I communicated it to\r\n     Lord Grenville; and desired him to write to you as soon as he\r\n     could. It gives me great pain to see, by the language of it, how\r\n     very much your mind is oppressed and disturbed in the impression\r\n     under which you write. Of the proposition which you suggest, it\r\n     certainly does not in any shape become me to offer any opinion; I\r\n     am precluded from doing so, both by the magnitude of the question,\r\n     and by its being of a nature upon which I cannot have either the\r\n     pretence or the means of exercising any judgment; and I so\r\n     expressed myself to Lord Grenville, when I read your letter to\r\n     him; all that, on my part, can be for me to do is, what I am sure\r\n     you will believe is the honest feeling of my mind, to express to\r\n     you the anxious and earnest wish of my heart, that all disquietude\r\n     and uneasiness may vanish from your mind; and that you may heartily\r\n     and happily continue to co-operate with Lord Grenville and Pitt, at\r\n     a time when the greatest interests which this country ever knew\r\n     seem to me to be at stake. For myself, you know that I am but a\r\n     private man, and have no other concern in these great public\r\n     questions, than that sense of common danger and common interest,\r\n     which ought, I think, to produce but one common voice in the\r\n     country. Mr. Wilberforce, you see, thinks otherwise, but does not\r\n     change my opinion by having changed his.\r\n\r\n     I am much obliged to you for the naval letter, which the post of\r\n     to-day brings me from Stowe; I will make the use of it which you\r\n     allow me to do, and will then return it to you. I hope Dr. Pegge\r\n     will find Lady B. better. I take for granted we shall soon meet\r\n     here.\r\n\r\n     I hear no news.\r\n\r\nGod bless you, my dear brother.\r\n\r\n     P.S.--As soon as I heard from you to-day (which was very late, as I\r\n     had gone out before the post came in), I sent to Lord G., to tell\r\n     him that if he wrote to-day, he must direct to Stowe.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     St. James's Square, Jan. 30th, 1794.\r\n     MY DEAREST BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     I believe Pitt's budget is finished, as it is to be opened on\r\n     Wednesday. I have, however, sent him your project; though I do not\r\n     conceive favourably of it, as the object appears so small, and\r\n     such a nest of hornets to be brought upon one by it.\r\n\r\n     The French seem certainly disposed to try their scheme of invasion.\r\n     This leads to the necessity of some augmentation of interior force,\r\n     and possibly some of our last year's plans will be resorted to. Our\r\n     best defence is unquestionably our water-guard, which is very\r\n     strong, and will, I trust, every day get stronger. In the meantime,\r\n     Lord Moira's force stationed at Cowes, and with its transports\r\n     ready to put to sea at the shortest notice, is no inconsiderable\r\n     check upon them.\r\n\r\n     I have no faith in their attacking Flanders; but rather believe\r\n     they will wait our attack. But two Dutch, and as many Flanders\r\n     mails are due.\r\n\r\n     Mack returns to the army to the great joy of every one. We expect\r\n     him over here every day.\r\n\r\n     Ever my dear brother's\r\n     Most affectionately,\r\n     G.\r\n\r\nThe Budget was brought forward by Mr. Pitt on the 2nd of February. It\r\nestimated the total supply for the year at twenty millions; and proposed\r\nfor the ways and means a loan of eleven millions, and the imposition of\r\nsome new taxes.\r\n\r\nHere was the first great pressure of the war on the industry of the\r\npeople. It was a trying moment with Government; but the demands of the\r\nMinister were, nevertheless, heartily responded to. The interior force\r\nof the kingdom at this time amounted to one hundred and forty thousand\r\nmen; and the foreign troops in British pay to forty thousand more. The\r\naugmentation of the Militia, which was not carried into effect till the\r\nfollowing month, was now occupying the consideration of Government.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     St. James's Square, Feb. 1st, 1794.\r\n     MY DEAREST BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     The idea of augmentation which I think most practicable, is that of\r\n     militia cavalry, to be raised by volunteers, in the same manner as\r\n     the additional companies in the last war, but to a much larger\r\n     extent than you mention in your letter. Dundas told me two days\r\n     since that he had been looking for your plan of last year, but had\r\n     mislaid it. Have you a copy? It does not seem advisable to broach\r\n     this idea much in conversation or discussion with Lord-Lieutenants\r\n     and Colonels till it is to a degree matured; for the St. Albans'\r\n     meeting, though very good for supporting a measure resolved upon,\r\n     or even for arranging particular details of a plan, of which the\r\n     outlines are already fixed, is but a bad place to prepare the plan\r\n     itself. As far as I am capable of judging, I think that the natural\r\n     defence of this country against an enemy once landed, is by the\r\n     immense irregular cavalry that might be collected, and formed round\r\n     small bodies of disciplined horse. This, of course, does not\r\n     exclude the necessity of some infantry to oppose the enemy in\r\n     front, while the cavalry harass his flanks and rear, and while your\r\n     naval force, even supposing it unable to have prevented the\r\n     landing, cuts off all possibility of supplies from France. We are\r\n     preparing, partly with the latter view, and partly as a means of\r\n     defence where frigates cannot act, a formidable force of gun-boats.\r\n\r\n     You say that all this is superfluous, and that the attempt will not\r\n     be made. I think its being made or not depends wholly on the other\r\n     employment which we can find for their force, and this depends on\r\n     points which we cannot command; viz.: internal commotion, and the\r\n     exertions of the German Powers on the side of the Rhine.\r\n\r\n     That they are making preparations with a view to having the thing\r\n     in their power is unquestionable, and we should be very deficient\r\n     in our duty if we did not put the country in a state to be prepared\r\n     for all events.\r\n\r\n     The employment of Lord Moira's force, and its future destination,\r\n     depend on plans of continental operations, but in the meantime its\r\n     effect is almost beyond calculation in its present position,\r\n     menacing everything from Dunkirk to Brest, and defending everything\r\n     from Yarmouth to the Land's End. You will see this in a minute, if\r\n     you compare the facility of moving that force, either by land or\r\n     sea, with the efforts of the same sort that the enemy can make,\r\n     either offensively or defensively.\r\n\r\n     We cannot have too much force anywhere, but if I am not very\r\n     sanguine, Sir C. Grey has already a force beyond what the service\r\n     requires; and it is likely that he will still be reinforced without\r\n     breaking up Lord Moira's army, which I consider as the most\r\n     usefully employed, and telling the most effectually against the\r\n     enemy of any troops now in our service.\r\n\r\n     I will send your artillery plan to Dundas.\r\n\r\n     Ever most affectionately yours,\r\n     G.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     St. James's Square, July 9th, 1794.\r\n     MY DEAREST BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     I am sincerely sorry to see that you do not entertain the same\r\n     hopes as I do of good from the new arrangements. I confess I think\r\n     it so great an object to have annihilated all distinction of\r\n     parties in this country among those who are attached to the present\r\n     order of things; and I feel that the late events abroad have given\r\n     so much more importance to this point, with a view to the internal\r\n     situation of this country, than it had before, that I cannot help\r\n     feeling very sanguine as to the consequences of the steps now taken\r\n     with that view. God only knows which of us is right, and time only\r\n     can show. In the meantime, _jacta est alea_, and we must abide by\r\n     it.\r\n\r\n     On the subject of war and peace, you state very truly, that nothing\r\n     is less probable than that peace should now be in our option. The\r\n     retreat to Antwerp has been decided, not by opinions here, nor even\r\n     by those of the Duke of York and Lord Cornwallis, but by the\r\n     necessity consequent upon the Austrian movements. Whether those\r\n     movements were right, I am not enough of a soldier, nor enough\r\n     informed as a statesman, to pretend to form an opinion. The\r\n     immediate effect of them is not necessarily the abandoning the\r\n     towns taken last year, which are in a state to maintain themselves\r\n     long, and to impede many of the operations of the enemy. Nor, as\r\n     long as the Austrians maintain their line from Louvain to Namur, is\r\n     the possibility of succouring them considered as desperate. What I\r\n     most fear in the present moment is the effect of despondency here\r\n     and abroad, without which I should see no reason why we should not,\r\n     as you suggest, fight the country over and over again, inch by\r\n     inch, with means and resources for carrying on the war, such as are\r\n     out of all comparison superior to those of the enemy. It would have\r\n     been a flattering and glorious thing, and a brilliant success, to\r\n     have terminated the war by the favourable result of a plan of\r\n     offensive operation in Flanders. If that has failed, I am very far\r\n     from thinking this a reason for abandoning a cause in the issue of\r\n     which I consider our existence as implicated. If we listen to the\r\n     ideas of peace in the present moment (even supposing it were\r\n     offered), it can be only because we confess ourselves unable to\r\n     carry on the war. Such a confession affords but a bad security\r\n     against the events which must follow, in Flanders, in Holland, and\r\n     (by a very rapid succession) in this island.\r\n\r\n     I do not know from whence the papers have got the idea of Lord\r\n     Camelford's return. He is not come, nor any officer or despatch,\r\n     from Vancouver, but I understand the ship has been heard of in\r\n     October last, all well. Many thanks for the offer of Paddington,\r\n     which we may probably be glad to avail ourselves of.\r\n\r\n     Ever, my dear brother,\r\n     Most affectionately yours,\r\n     G.\r\n\r\n     We have nothing new from Lord Hood; and I am told that officers who\r\n     know the coast do not speak favourably of the chance of doing\r\n     anything against the French fleet in their present situation.\r\n\r\nThe failure of the Imperialists had thrown a serious damp on the spirits\r\nof the allies. It appears to have been thought the Austrians had not\r\nshown sufficient energy and determination; and it was resolved to send\r\nover Lord Spencer and Mr. Thomas Grenville to Vienna, in the hope of\r\ninducing them to make more vigorous exertions. A subsequent letter from\r\nMr. Thomas Grenville to the Duke of Portland contains an admirable\r\nreport of the progress of the mission.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     St. James's Square, July 19th, 1794.\r\n     MY DEAREST BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     Tom has, I know, mentioned to you the Commission which he has\r\n     undertaken--jointly with Lord Spencer--to endeavour to encourage\r\n     our Austrian allies to a little more exertion and energy, which,\r\n     after all the late events, I continue persuaded is _the only_\r\n     thing wanting to ensure success, instead of such a series of\r\n     retreats as the last month has shown. God knows whether they will\r\n     succeed; but it is an infinite satisfaction to me to see his\r\n     talents employed in the public service, and to be corresponding\r\n     with him on subjects of this nature. The rest of our public events\r\n     are just such as you see them in the papers.\r\n\r\n     Lord Cornwallis is returned, speaking highly of the Duke of York,\r\n     and far otherwise of the Austrian Generals, to whom he, and all\r\n     mankind in Flanders, impute all that has happened. It is a\r\n     whimsical circumstance, and hardly to have been foreseen, that in a\r\n     war which we carry on conjointly with Austria, the great want which\r\n     we experience should be that of Austrian Generals, of capacity\r\n     sufficient to command the excellent troops which are acting in the\r\n     Netherlands.\r\n\r\n     My American negotiation is, I think, going on promisingly. I have\r\n     nothing else to tell you; and am, indeed, so completely knocked up\r\n     by this last week's fagging, as hardly to be able to write at all.\r\n     This evening I am going to Dropmore, for a little respite.\r\n\r\n     Ever most affectionately yours,\r\n     G.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. THOMAS GRENVILLE TO THE DUKE OF PORTLAND.\r\n\r\n     (Private.)       Vienna, August 24th, 1794.\r\n     DEAR DUKE OF PORTLAND,\r\n\r\n     It had been very much my intention to have written to you by our\r\n     messenger of the 16th instant, because, although our despatches\r\n     have been very much detailed, and have not, therefore, left much to\r\n     be said in private letters, it is upon these occasions, I know,\r\n     some satisfaction to hear that nothing remains behind, which is\r\n     material to the subject; but having been hitherto prevented, by the\r\n     very entire occupation of our time here, I take the opportunity of\r\n     writing to you, a little at large, by the messenger who is going to\r\n     England to-night.\r\n\r\n     You know that upon the slight view which the shortness of the time\r\n     allowed me to take of the business in question here, I was\r\n     persuaded that we probably might, in some degree, succeed in our\r\n     expedition; because, if the course of things here could not be\r\n     improved by our journey, yet I should consider the being able to\r\n     ascertain what that state was, as an object very useful to pursue,\r\n     and one which, if pursued with attention, we might probably succeed\r\n     in possessing ourselves of. How far we have already obtained this\r\n     information you will have seen by the communications which we have\r\n     made; and I much fear that our journey will not produce any\r\n     advantage of a more solid and substantial description. To say that\r\n     it might not be possible to procure from the Government here a\r\n     formal consent to such an arrangement as we have to propose, is\r\n     more than I would assert: although, the condition which they\r\n     positively insist upon of being paid for it by loan and subsidy, as\r\n     well as all the difficulties which they throw upon the subject of\r\n     the proposed barrier, and upon that of acting in the Netherlands,\r\n     might well seem to justify the opinion of its being improbable that\r\n     anything like the proposed arrangement would be consented to. But\r\n     the misfortune is, that--in my judgment, at least--the evil lies\r\n     much deeper, and is such as would leave me little hope of seeing\r\n     any effectual purpose served, even by the signature of a Convention\r\n     between the two Courts.\r\n\r\n     I do not know of any good ground for believing the common report of\r\n     treachery, either in the civil or military government of the\r\n     country; but I know, that if the principle upon which our\r\n     Government act in the prosecution of the war is not cordially felt\r\n     here--if the greatness of those interests, which we think now at\r\n     stake, is not to the same degree here considered as being of the\r\n     very essence and existence of all regulated government, a\r\n     Convention will not give them a livelier perception of this common\r\n     danger, or teach them to see in it a crisis such as demands greater\r\n     energy and exertions, than any other state of things could call\r\n     for. But this common principle is not all that is wanting in the\r\n     present case: we think, in England, that the preservation of the\r\n     Austrian Netherlands is an object important to us as providing a\r\n     defence for Holland, and important to the Court of Vienna as\r\n     forming a rich and considerable possession to the House of Austria,\r\n     and, therefore, making an object of common interest, though\r\n     touching Austria still more sensibly than England. If this obvious\r\n     view of the interests of both countries prevailed in the\r\n     Governments of both--as one might rationally expect that it\r\n     would--it would naturally furnish, by common consent, a very\r\n     leading and governing motive, as well to the operations of the war,\r\n     as to the ultimate issue of it. This, however, is not the view\r\n     which is entertained here, or which I can persuade myself is really\r\n     acted upon by those whose influence is decisive here.\r\n\r\n     M. de Thugut, the efficient Minister of this Court, is personally\r\n     very much disposed (and long has been so) to the old project of an\r\n     exchange of the Netherlands; and though that project appears to be\r\n     laid aside for the purpose of conciliating Great Britain and\r\n     Holland, yet it is evident that M. de Thugut's opinions are such as\r\n     lead him to set but little value upon the possession of the\r\n     Netherlands, and, therefore, that every circumstance, either of\r\n     expense or of military enterprise, which looks towards the\r\n     acquisition and defence of those provinces, is as much discouraged\r\n     by him as he can venture to do, without openly declaring the whole\r\n     bias of his mind: and it is very remarkable that, much as we have\r\n     made it our business to press this to him in all our conversations,\r\n     we have never yet been able to draw from him even a cold assent to\r\n     the idea of the Low Countries being of any real value in themselves\r\n     to the Emperor; though he sometimes feebly admits that, with a\r\n     considerable addition to them, they might be made so.\r\n\r\n     It may be said, that a Convention might engage them on this point,\r\n     whatever their inclinations may be; but the answer is, first, that\r\n     in point of fact they do object to bind themselves to the employing\r\n     one hundred thousand men _in the Netherlands_, though they have not\r\n     finally refused it; and secondly, that be there what agreement\r\n     there may, the only substantial security for a hearty co-operation\r\n     in fighting for that country, or for any manly system to be adopted\r\n     hereafter for the preservation of it, must arise from a sense--in\r\n     the owners--of the value of its possession, and not from the words\r\n     employed in any treaty respecting it. I am aware that part of the\r\n     indifference which I so much remark in M. de Thugut may be\r\n     affected, for the purpose of throwing the whole weight of the\r\n     defence of the Low Countries upon the Maritime Powers; but if that\r\n     is his policy, he must mean to support it by abstaining from any\r\n     vigorous exertions in behalf of it, and in the end, whether his\r\n     coolness and inactivity shall have been produced by a real or\r\n     disguised opinion, the result will equally have been fatal to that\r\n     earnest and animated concert, which is so much to be wished for on\r\n     this occasion.\r\n\r\n     You see that I have so far considered the Convention, as taking\r\n     place upon the terms proposed by us; but you will have known, long\r\n     before you receive this letter, that they have persisted from the\r\n     first in asking, as indispensable conditions, that their loan must\r\n     be completely satisfied in England to enable them to answer the\r\n     demands of this year, and that they must receive from England a\r\n     considerable subsidy for next campaign, if it is expected that they\r\n     should act vigorously in the prosecution of the war, which they\r\n     assert themselves to be utterly unable to do without pecuniary\r\n     assistance from England. We have urged them very ineffectually on\r\n     this point: they declare that they have good hopes of M. de Merey's\r\n     succeeding in obtaining these demands at London, and the\r\n     negotiation actually hangs upon the report which they hourly expect\r\n     from him on this subject; though we have repeatedly told them that\r\n     their expectation was hopeless, and that, meanwhile, the delay\r\n     occasioned by it might be fatal to those exertions which required\r\n     immediate action and enterprise.\r\n\r\n     What decision the Cabinet will make upon this heavy demand of\r\n     subsidy, is doubtless a very important question, of which they will\r\n     be the fit and competent judges; but if that question simply turned\r\n     upon the supposed probability of our being able to purchase, even\r\n     at that dear rate, a proportionate degree of energy and activity in\r\n     the war from this Government, I confess I do not hesitate to say\r\n     that, from what I see here, I should not believe, if the experiment\r\n     is tried, it will well answer their expectations. There is no soul\r\n     in the bodies of these men--none, at least, which is alive to the\r\n     magnitude of all the objects now at stake, or which leads them to\r\n     share with you, as it ought the great points of common danger and\r\n     common interest; and while these mainsprings are wanting, it is in\r\n     vain to look for such movements and effects as cannot be produced\r\n     without them. If this radical defect did not exist; if the\r\n     Government here was as earnest as it ought to be in its\r\n     contemplation of this war, but really was without the means of\r\n     prosecuting it; if it acknowledged and took its proper interest in\r\n     the possession of the Netherlands, and asked your assistance to\r\n     that object, only because they had exhausted all their own\r\n     resources, there might be great inducements to hope that, in\r\n     furnishing to them the supply which they wish, you might on your\r\n     side expect all the active effects which ought to be produced by\r\n     it; but I know not how to hope that a subsidy will give vigour to\r\n     their councils or enterprise to their armies; still less can I hope\r\n     that a subsidy, given for the preservation of the Netherlands, will\r\n     teach them to put a proper value upon those possessions on their\r\n     own account, though it certainly would teach them how highly you\r\n     value their retaining them on your account.\r\n\r\n     All M. de Thugut's conversation, even upon the idea of the subsidy\r\n     taking place, is evidently adverse to the prosecuting of the war in\r\n     the Netherlands; and even when the danger of Holland is urged as a\r\n     powerful argument for this course, he very coldly answers that,\r\n     supposing the French to succeed in Holland for a time, they would\r\n     be glad enough to relinquish it if the arms of the allies were\r\n     successful in the interior of France. How, then, can one easily\r\n     hope that the payment of a subsidy will reconcile views so\r\n     remote--as I apprehend these are--from the wishes of the English\r\n     Cabinet, or prevent much of thwarting and contradiction in the\r\n     operations of the campaign? I confess that I suspect this\r\n     disinclination to the defence of the Netherlands to arise, not only\r\n     from a habit of undervaluing them, but partly, too, from a\r\n     persuasion that the Maritime Powers must and will, at their own\r\n     expense, protect them; and partly, also, from a narrow and timid\r\n     view of collecting the whole Austrian force on the German frontier,\r\n     so as to be more immediately ready for the defence of the imperial\r\n     dominions, as well as to have less reason to fear in their jealousy\r\n     of the intentions of the King of Prussia.\r\n\r\n     Upon this latter point the difficulties are, perhaps, much more\r\n     likely to be increased than to be relieved, by transferring the\r\n     Prussian subsidy to the army of Austria, because the Court of\r\n     Berlin will doubtless express great dissatisfaction at that\r\n     measure; and everything which excites their apprehension here, will\r\n     naturally more or less interfere with the energy of their\r\n     operations against France. I do not mean that these arguments would\r\n     be stated as reasons against their acting up to the conditions of\r\n     the subsidy; but I fear they would nevertheless be found to have\r\n     too much influence and effect in practice.\r\n\r\n     The objections which have seemed to me to arise against a large\r\n     subsidy to Austria--from the little hope which I should have of its\r\n     producing from hence that exertion of force, and that course of\r\n     military operations which, with a view to Holland, we should think\r\n     ourselves fully entitled to--are of course much increased by my\r\n     apprehension of the bad and dangerous consequences which would\r\n     affect our Government at home, from a second disappointment of so\r\n     costly an experiment, which I must hope need not be considered as\r\n     necessary to the prosecution of the war.\r\n\r\n     If it is true--as it may, perhaps, be found--that much of the\r\n     languor and apathy of this Court arises out of a confidence in the\r\n     greatness of our exertions, which may allow them to be sparing of\r\n     their own, if (as there is reason to believe) they have still the\r\n     fair means of recruiting their armies and maintaining their present\r\n     military force, is it not to be hoped that the necessity of the\r\n     case will rouse them to the use of those means, when they see no\r\n     other prospect of safety open to them? They sometimes talk stoutly\r\n     of all that they would do by arming the empire, and other vigorous\r\n     measures, in case the French succeeded in forcing their way to\r\n     menace Germany. But why are these exertions to be reserved for any\r\n     other situation of things? and why are we to pay them a million and\r\n     a half, rather than put them to the full extent of all their own\r\n     exertions and resources? Nor is it, perhaps, to be overlooked, in\r\n     this view of the subject, that the crooked policy of Prussia would\r\n     perhaps acquiesce in the loss of his own subsidy much more readily,\r\n     if he does not see it given to Austria, but has the satisfaction of\r\n     seeing Austria fight her own battles with her own men and money.\r\n     They always insist here, too, that they are sure the King of\r\n     Prussia, even if his bargain should not be renewed with England,\r\n     will not withdraw entirely from the war, and still less will take a\r\n     part hostile to the combined Powers. And whether this speculation\r\n     of theirs is true or not, while they believe it, they are more at\r\n     liberty to act solely against France, without fearing any attack\r\n     from the quarter of Berlin.\r\n\r\n     The great danger, perhaps, of trying another campaign without\r\n     subsidizing either Prussia or Austria, might first be found with\r\n     respect to Holland (at least, if the Government here act as they\r\n     threaten in the case of being unsubsidized), by their withdrawing\r\n     of the Austrian army from the neighbourhood of Maestricht, and\r\n     contracting their defence to the limits of their German frontier.\r\n     But even if they did so--which may be much doubted--might not\r\n     England and Holland, at a smaller expense than that paid to the\r\n     King of Prussia, subsidize an army of auxiliary troops to act for\r\n     the defence of Holland, and for carrying on the war in the\r\n     Netherlands, and have that army really and effectually at their own\r\n     disposal, and doing the service which they were paid for. How far\r\n     this may be practicable, I do not pretend to judge. If it is so,\r\n     nobody could doubt that it would be an expense more grateful to the\r\n     public of our own country than that of paying for a force which we\r\n     cannot bring as we ought into action, and which we must consider as\r\n     compelled by their own interests to continue the war, whether we\r\n     pay them or not for doing so. By subsidizing Austria, we acquire no\r\n     greater force than that of the last campaign, and we put the\r\n     justification of that enormous expense upon the unpromising chance\r\n     of a vigour and energy on their part such as they appear to be\r\n     altogether incapable of exerting, unless under the pressure of such\r\n     a danger as would force them to act without hiring them to do so.\r\n\r\n     The length of this letter is such as I am really ashamed to add to.\r\n\r\n     Lord Spencer writes to Lord Grenville by the same opportunity.\r\n     Neither he nor I see much prospect of making ourselves useful in\r\n     the shape and with the views proposed, and we are therefore\r\n     naturally anxious to see the ordinary course resumed in some other\r\n     person, and any such arrangements taken as may admit of our return\r\n     as soon as without inconvenience might be. We speak the more\r\n     directly on this matter, from the entire and perfect agreement of\r\n     our view of it, and our opinions concerning it; at the same time,\r\n     if, in your determinations at home, it should seem to you that Lord\r\n     Spencer can and ought to stay longer, with any fair prospect of\r\n     such advantages to this great subject as his peculiar situation\r\n     alone could promise, I do not doubt but that he would consent to\r\n     protract his stay a little longer; and while he does, I certainly\r\n     will not ask to desert him, _bien entendu_, that I cannot think of\r\n     staying one hour after him.\r\n\r\n     Ever, my dear Duke,\r\n     Very truly and faithfully yours.\r\n\r\nThe session had been protracted to the beginning of July, not merely by\r\nthe interest of passing occurrences, but by the efforts of the\r\nOpposition to damage the character and embarrass the action of\r\nMinisters. The most remarkable of these movements was a string of\r\nresolutions moved in the Upper House by the Duke of Bedford, and in the\r\nLower by Mr. Fox, and urged upon the consideration of both Houses with\r\nan amount of ability that could not have failed of its object, had that\r\nobject been a sound one, or sustained by the public opinion of the\r\ncountry. The main purpose was to obtain from Parliament a protest\r\nagainst the war, and to compel the Government to enter into proposals\r\nfor a peace with France. After setting forth that the policy of the\r\nAdministration had been that of strict neutrality before the\r\ncommencement of hostilities, and that, after the declaration of war,\r\nMinisters adopted the policy of resistance to the ambition and\r\naggrandisement of France, the resolutions went on to state, that at the\r\nbeginning of the war it was considered a matter of general concern in\r\nwhich His Majesty was to have the cordial co-operation of the powers\r\nunited with him by the ties of interest and alliance; that His Majesty\r\nhad not received that co-operation; that Russia had not contributed in\r\nany shape to the common cause; that Denmark and Sweden had coalesced to\r\ndefend themselves against any attempt to force them into it; that Venice\r\nand Switzerland remained neuter; that Sardinia was subsidized merely to\r\nact on the defensive; and that Great Britain was loaded with a subsidy\r\nwhich ought properly to be borne by Prussia; and, finally, that the time\r\nwas now come when peace might be secured on a permanent basis, and that\r\nit was the duty of His Majesty's Ministers to avail themselves of the\r\nopportunity.\r\n\r\nThere was some truth in these statements, although the general deduction\r\nwas erroneous, and the colouring throughout false. The allies had not\r\ngiven that cordial co-operation to Great Britain which they were bound\r\nto do, and Prussia had evaded the onus of the coalition. Mr. Thomas\r\nGrenville's letter to the Duke of Portland discovers a great deal more\r\nthan was known to the Duke of Bedford or Mr. Fox in illustration of\r\nthese facts; and the correspondence that follows, which is of the\r\nhighest importance from the confidential character of its details,\r\nconfirms them. But the attempt to cast the responsibility of these\r\ncircumstances upon the English Cabinet was equally ungenerous and\r\nunjust. The policy of Ministers had undergone no change, except that\r\nwhich was contingent upon the altered situation of affairs. To preserve\r\na strict neutrality in the face of a declaration of war, was clearly\r\nimpossible; and to abandon the war, from an abstract desire for peace,\r\nat a time when the common enemy had gained enormous advantages, and were\r\nmenacing the tranquillity and liberties of other nations, and\r\nthreatening an invasion of England, would have precipitated results the\r\nvery reverse of those contemplated by the Opposition. To have made\r\nproposals to France on what the resolutions termed \"equitable and\r\nmoderate conditions of reconciliation,\" would have involved two serious\r\ndifficulties--the negotiation, in the first place, with a Government of\r\nanarchy which England had justifiably refused to treat with from the\r\noutset; and, in the second place, the admission of the power of France\r\nto dictate terms which England could not accept without degradation, or\r\nrefuse without aggravating the existing grounds of hostility.\r\nCircumstances might arise--such as a change in the Government--to\r\nobviate the former difficulty; but the latter was insuperable. It would\r\nhave been inconsistent with the principles upon which the war was\r\nundertaken to have proposed or submitted to any conditions which France,\r\nexulting over her recent successes, could have been expected to approve;\r\nand the result of such a negotiation at such a moment must have been, in\r\nany event, fruitless and inglorious. The decision of Parliament was\r\nunequivocal and decisive. The Duke of Bedford's motion was lost on the\r\nquestion of adjournment, and Mr. Fox's thrown out by a majority of 210\r\nagainst 57 votes. The influence of the Opposition was overthrown. The\r\ncountry was against them, and their ranks were daily weakened by\r\nsecessions. So strongly and unanimously had the Parliament pronounced\r\nits judgment in favour of the maintenance of the war, that His Majesty\r\nat the close of the session was enabled to urge both Houses \"to\r\npersevere with increased vigour and exertion in the present arduous\r\ncontest against a power irreconcilably hostile in its principles and\r\nspirit to all regular and established government.\"\r\n\r\nImmediately after the close of the session, some changes took place in\r\nthe _materiel_ of the Administration, arising out of the accession of\r\npower the Ministry had obtained by the adhesion of some of the leading\r\nWhigs. The Duke of Portland (to whom Mr. Thomas Grenville addressed his\r\nfirst letters from Vienna) was appointed Third Secretary of State; Earl\r\nFitzwilliam, Lord President of the Council; Earl Spencer, Privy Seal;\r\nand Mr. Wyndham, Secretary at War. Further changes took place before the\r\nclose of the year, when Lord Fitzwilliam accepted the Government of\r\nIreland, and was succeeded as President of the Council by Earl\r\nMansfield. Lord Spencer, at the same time, was placed at the head of the\r\nAdmiralty; and Lord Chatham, the brother of the Premier, who had for\r\nsome years occupied that department, was made Lord Privy Seal.\r\n\r\nThe junction with the Whigs was, as far as it went, a new coalition;\r\nbut, under the circumstances which led to it, a coalition of a very\r\ndifferent character from that which had been entered into by Mr. Fox and\r\nLord North. The old elements of the Cabinet still held the ascendancy;\r\nand although some sincere friends of Mr. Pitt doubted the prudence of\r\nadmitting the Whigs to office, no actual disturbance of the existing\r\nsystem was apprehended from it. All agreed upon the question of the\r\nwar--the one great question upon which agreement was essential to the\r\nrepose and security of the country. In forming this alliance, however,\r\nanother question had been overlooked, which was now daily rising into\r\nimportance, and upon which the Whigs differed widely from Mr. Pitt, not\r\nso much in principles, as in the time and mode of their application.\r\nThat question, the clog and difficulty of every Administration, was\r\nIreland. But the moment had not yet arrived when the dangers of this\r\nquestion became manifest.\r\n\r\nThe following series of letters trace the whole course of the\r\nnegotiations going forward on the continent, and exhibit in minute\r\ndetail the actual position in which England stood in her relation to the\r\nrest of the allies, and the incessant energy she exerted in vain to\r\nawaken them to a just sense of their obligations.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD GRENVILLE TO MR. THOMAS GRENVILLE.\r\n\r\n     (Private.)      St. James's Square, Aug. 26th, 1794.\r\n     MY DEAREST BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     I have to acknowledge your private letters, which I do not attempt\r\n     to answer by this conveyance for obvious reasons, and only write\r\n     that you may not receive my public despatch without a line to tell\r\n     you that your private letters have reached me, and that I will\r\n     state to you, by a safer opportunity, what occurs to me upon them.\r\n     I am a little out of humour with you for not telling me how you\r\n     bore your journey, and how you are, but I am willing to hope it has\r\n     not renewed any symptoms of your former complaint. There never was\r\n     such a succession of cross-incidents as seem to have accompanied\r\n     every part of poor Merey's mission, and I fear his loss is a\r\n     serious one to us all. What do you think of Robespierre's death? I\r\n     look upon it as a very favourable event, not from any opinion that\r\n     I ever entertained of his personal talents, but because those who\r\n     succeed him are evidently under the necessity of lowering the\r\n     despotism of the Revolutionary Government, and of giving up thereby\r\n     the great instrument with which they worked. A strong proof of\r\n     this, and a circumstance very favourable in itself, is, that\r\n     instead of a Committee of six or eight efficient persons who\r\n     conducted the Government in all its branches, and with absolute\r\n     power, they have already been obliged to institute twelve\r\n     Committees, who are to be chosen with a sort of rotation, those who\r\n     go out not being re-eligible. This is, in fact, a substitution of\r\n     the weakest possible form of Executive Government in lieu of the\r\n     strongest.\r\n\r\n     God bless you, my dearest brother, and believe me\r\n     Ever most affectionately yours,\r\n     G.\r\n\r\n     We have received this morning accounts from Italy, mentioning the\r\n     reduction of Calvi. You will probably have heard it by this time.\r\n\r\nIt was in the beginning of this month of August, that the Duke of York,\r\nat that time stationed at Breda, retreated before the French towards\r\nBois-le-Duc; and afterwards, upon the advance of General Pichegru,\r\ncrossed the Maese, and took up a fresh position near Grave. Seeing the\r\nnecessity of placing the conduct of the campaign in more experienced\r\nhands, Ministers now proposed to give the command in chief to Lord\r\nCornwallis; but before this step could be finally resolved upon, it was\r\nnecessary to consult the feelings of His Majesty on the subject. Mr.\r\nPitt therefore submitted a statement to the King, assigning the reasons\r\nwhich induced him to urge the appointment of Lord Cornwallis upon His\r\nMajesty's consideration; and suggesting that Mr. Wyndham should be sent\r\non a mission to the army. The following was His Majesty's answer:\r\n\r\n     Weymouth, August 27th, 1704. Thirty-five minutes past One, P.M.\r\n\r\n     I have this instant received Mr. Pitt's letter accompanying the\r\n     Paper of Considerations, which I undoubtedly should wish to keep;\r\n     but not knowing whether Mr. Pitt has a fair copy of it, I have\r\n     thought it safest to return.\r\n\r\n     Whatever can give vigour to the remains of the campaign, I shall\r\n     certainly as a duty think it right not to withhold my consent; but\r\n     I own, in my son's place, I should beg my being allowed to return\r\n     home, if the command is given to Lord Cornwallis, though I should\r\n     not object to the command being entrusted to General Clairfayt.\r\n     From feeling this, I certainly will not write, but approve of Mr.\r\n     Wyndham's going to the army, and shall be happy if my son views\r\n     this in a different light than I should.\r\n\r\n     I will not delay the messenger, as I think no time ought to be lost\r\n     in forming some fixed plan, and that the measure of sending Mr.\r\n     Wyndham is every way advantageous.\r\n\r\n     GEORGE R.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to observe that Mr. Wyndham was sent upon his\r\nmission; and that the Duke of York, having met some further reverses,\r\nwhich almost incapacitated the troops from acting even on the defensive,\r\nshortly afterwards returned to England.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD GRENVILLE TO MR. THOMAS GRENVILLE.\r\n\r\n     (Private.) St. James's Square, Aug. 29th, 1794.\r\n     MY DEAREST BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     The despatch which you will receive by this messenger, and the\r\n     letter which Wyndham has promised to write to you from the British\r\n     head-quarters, will explain to you the whole of the system which we\r\n     have adopted, as affording the only hope of vigorous or successful\r\n     exertion. The Austrian Government is already prepared for your\r\n     proposal, respecting the giving to Lord Cornwallis the command of\r\n     the whole combined force, as Count Starhemberg is apprized of it,\r\n     having, indeed, himself in a great degree suggested the measure, on\r\n     some general hints which I threw out to him, in order to try the\r\n     ground. For the moment, the great point seems to be to bring them\r\n     to acquiesce in the virtual command which his rank of Field-Marshal\r\n     will give him over Clairfayt, and to send positive orders to the\r\n     latter to that effect; and if there should be any difficulty in\r\n     Clairfayt's submitting to this, then to let Clairfayt absent\r\n     himself for the moment, and leave the Austrian troops under the\r\n     command of some officer whose standing will occasion no difficulty\r\n     in this respect. You will observe that, by virtual command, we mean\r\n     precisely the same deference as the Duke of York has shown to the\r\n     Prince of Coburg, not extending to any of the points of military\r\n     etiquette by which command is usually rendered ostensible, but\r\n     going to the effect of complying with his suggestions respecting\r\n     the mode of executing the operations agreed upon in concert, when\r\n     the instructions of his Court do not interfere with such\r\n     suggestions. Before you receive this letter, Lord Cornwallis will\r\n     probably be on the spot; and it is therefore urgent, to prevent the\r\n     first beginnings of dissension, that no time should be lost in\r\n     making the Austrians give their orders to Clairfayt. Knowing the\r\n     delay of that Government, and the difficulty of getting them to\r\n     adopt any decided line of conduct, we have thought it best to do\r\n     the thing first, and afterwards to try to obtain their consent to\r\n     it. If you succeed, or, indeed, in any case, it will be useful that\r\n     you should write directly to Lord C. upon the subject, as that may\r\n     save a week, at a time when a week's delay might be of the utmost\r\n     importance.\r\n\r\n     With respect to the Duke of York, Wyndham will probably tell you in\r\n     confidence how he succeeds in his negotiation. It certainly is a\r\n     pretty strong instance of zeal and desire to facilitate whatever\r\n     can promote the cause, when he undertakes a task of no less\r\n     difficulty than the reconciling the mind of a young Prince to a\r\n     supercession in his military command, and that too at the precise\r\n     moment of moving forwards, after so mortifying a retreat. I am,\r\n     however, not without hopes of his success; and, at all events, the\r\n     moment was too critical to suffer any consideration to interfere\r\n     with the only means of salvation that appeared practicable.\r\n\r\n     With respect to the languor of the Austrian Government, and the\r\n     doubt whether even money will obtain from them decisive efforts, we\r\n     have strongly felt the force of all that you have stated on that\r\n     head. But we are inclined to flatter ourselves, that if we once\r\n     obtain so large a force as is mentioned in my despatch, and can put\r\n     that force, in addition to our own, under the absolute and supreme\r\n     direction of such a man as Lord Cornwallis, we shall at least be\r\n     able to say to ourselves, whatever be the result, that we have done\r\n     everything that it was possible to do; and without trying this\r\n     measure, I confess for one that I should not have that sentiment in\r\n     my mind. I lament that we have thought ourselves obliged to bring\r\n     forward the discussion of a precise barrier, and yet I do not see\r\n     how it could be avoided. But the impression may be very bad on\r\n     their minds, if we appear to be narrowing the benefits which they\r\n     are to derive from exertion, instead of animating them by the hope\r\n     of increased advantage. I have not dwelt on this point in my\r\n     despatch, as you mention that you intended to write further upon\r\n     it.\r\n\r\n     When the idea of transferring the subsidy was opened to me by\r\n     Starhemberg, from Merey's instructions it was expressly stated, as\r\n     a part of the plan, that the empire could be made to subsidize the\r\n     Prussian troops; and this agrees with every information we receive\r\n     on the subject, all which concur in stating the efforts of the\r\n     empire, particularly in money, as being very far below what they\r\n     could be brought to make by the joint exertions of Austria and\r\n     Prussia. But on my pressing Starhemberg for further detail on this\r\n     point, he has always avoided it, assuring me, whether truly or not,\r\n     that he found no particulars respecting it among Merey's papers.\r\n     You will see that in the despatch we make the whole dependent on a\r\n     complete and _bona fide_ execution of this point, and my language\r\n     to him has always been of the same nature. But I confess that it is\r\n     on this point that I feel the strongest apprehensions, and I much\r\n     fear that Austria will both be disposed to evade it, and, in truth,\r\n     unable to accomplish it. Should this be the case, the whole plan\r\n     must be abandoned; and we should, I believe, in that event, be\r\n     disposed to turn our subsidy to the object of raising other force,\r\n     of whatever nature, so as, if possible, to form a separate British\r\n     and Dutch army, destined to act under Lord Cornwallis, without the\r\n     pretence or show of concert with either of the German Powers.\r\n\r\n     With respect to your remaining at Vienna, you will easily conceive,\r\n     that having a project of this nature to propose, none of us thought\r\n     we should give it its fair chance if we put it into other hands\r\n     than those in which the business now is. We allow for your natural\r\n     desire of quitting a scene which, God knows, must be mortifying\r\n     enough to men who feel how much of the safety of Europe depends on\r\n     the conduct of the Austrian Government, and who see how unfit that\r\n     Government is to be trusted with the interests of the smallest\r\n     corporation. But we are confident that as long as there may remain\r\n     the hope of doing so much good as would, we trust, be done by the\r\n     complete success of the present plan, you will not be unwilling to\r\n     give your assistance to it.\r\n\r\n     With respect to what you mention about yourself, you know my wishes\r\n     on the subject, but I certainly will not urge them beyond what you\r\n     are disposed to do. The proposal Lord Fitzwilliam makes to you is,\r\n     I fairly own, in my apprehension, one less eligible than that of\r\n     Vienna; but I fear a nearer view of that Court has rather\r\n     strengthened than diminished your indisposition to that situation.\r\n     You know, as well as I do, all the _desagremens_ belonging to the\r\n     post of Irish Secretary; but it is certainly an important and\r\n     honourable one, and such as to afford you ample room for showing\r\n     yourself such as you are: more, perhaps, than many others which\r\n     commonly rank higher in public estimation. My objection to it is\r\n     the banishment, which obtains as much as in the foreign missions,\r\n     and certainly to the most disagreeable of all countries. I do not\r\n     know well how to make myself quite a disinterested adviser; but if\r\n     I was to give you fairly the result of my thoughts upon it, I\r\n     should still beg you to look at the foreign line, and if that must\r\n     not be, I should then say _yes_ to the question of Ireland.\r\n\r\n     Supposing that _yes_ were decided, let me ask you whether your\r\n     remaining some time longer at Vienna, so as finally to conclude,\r\n     not the leading points only, but all the details of the arrangement\r\n     now in question, and of the preparations for the active scene of\r\n     next year, is wholly out of the question? It seems very clear that\r\n     no arrangement will happen before that time which can change the\r\n     Irish Government, and in the meanwhile you would be honourably and\r\n     _most usefully_ employed. I have, however, not hinted this idea to\r\n     any individual, nor will I. If all this is wholly out of the\r\n     question, I conclude that my reply to your answer to these\r\n     despatches, will bring to Lord Spencer and you the King's\r\n     permission to return to England.\r\n\r\n     It would be very satisfactory to you to see how well things are\r\n     going on here, and how completely our hopes have been realized on\r\n     the subject which employed so much of our time and thoughts this\r\n     summer.\r\n\r\n     God bless you, my dearest brother.\r\n\r\nAt this time, the new changes in the Administration, already alluded to,\r\nwere under discussion in the Cabinet; and, amongst the rest, it was\r\nproposed that the government of Ireland should be offered to Lord\r\nFitzwilliam. As soon as this appointment was suggested, his Lordship\r\nwrote to Mr. Thomas Grenville to offer him the office of Secretary.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. THOMAS GRENVILLE TO EARL FITZWILLIAM.\r\n\r\n     (Private.)      Vienna, Aug. 30th, 1794,\r\n     DEAR LORD FITZWILLIAM,\r\n\r\n     You will already have heard enough of our proceedings here to give\r\n     you no considerable expectations of any great good to be done here;\r\n     and if you happen to have been in London, and to have read a very\r\n     tedious and long letter which I wrote on the 24th to the Duke of\r\n     Portland, you will have seen there, more at large than it is\r\n     necessary to repeat, the general view and impression of our minds\r\n     as to the business with which we are charged; and the little ground\r\n     which there appears to us for hoping that even by satisfying their\r\n     pecuniary demands, we could depend upon such exertions being made\r\n     in consequence, as the country would expect in return for expense\r\n     of so great and heavy a scale. It is very true, to be sure, that in\r\n     this as well as in many other cases, the difficulties present\r\n     themselves something more readily than the remedies to them, yet\r\n     upon the question of the subsidy, if we are right in our\r\n     conception that it would not probably produce, either in degree or\r\n     in shape, that energy and cordial co-operation which we are looking\r\n     for, perhaps no difficulty could be much more serious than that of\r\n     engaging ourselves at home in an expense, the disappointment of\r\n     which might produce in the minds of the public an effect, both with\r\n     respect to the war itself and with respect to the Government which\r\n     supports it, of the most perilous description. It is very true that\r\n     great objects must sometimes be pursued at great hazards, and\r\n     nobody is more ready than I to acknowledge that a greater object\r\n     cannot be found than the successful prosecution of this war; but\r\n     the peculiar question of subsidy seems to me to apply chiefly to\r\n     the mode of carrying on the war, and, I would hope, not to the\r\n     entire decision of pursuing or abandoning it.\r\n\r\n     I will not again go over the same detail which I pursued in my\r\n     letter to the Duke of Portland, but satisfy myself with recalling\r\n     to your observation, that the Government here, in speaking of the\r\n     exertions which they should be driven to the necessity of making,\r\n     if the French should threaten the German empire, plainly admitted\r\n     that they do still possess resources capable of being applied to\r\n     such critical exigencies, and in this confession show pretty\r\n     plainly that nothing but the necessity of the case will drive them\r\n     to the use of those means. Is it not then probable that a much\r\n     greater exertion may be made by that necessity existing in our\r\n     refusal of subsidy, than will be made by such pecuniary assistance\r\n     being given, as may relieve them from the necessity of making any\r\n     exertion of their own?\r\n\r\n     If the immediate alarm on the side of Holland seems to be a\r\n     considerable inducement to the grant of the subsidy, in order to\r\n     interest Austria in that very important defence of which the\r\n     Netherlands make so essential a part, it should not, on the other\r\n     hand, escape notice, that all our observation on their language and\r\n     views would lead us very much to doubt how far they would\r\n     cordially concur in the defence of the Netherlands, even though\r\n     they might consent to do so in the words of their contract;\r\n     whatever value they may or may not themselves put upon the\r\n     possession of the Low Countries, they always argue and act under\r\n     the manifest persuasion, that the Maritime Powers are alone\r\n     interested enough in this point to secure its being ultimately\r\n     carried, and they give it pretty plainly to be understood, that\r\n     they mean to depend upon us for that object. Under this view, they\r\n     seem to me always disposed to consider the operations of the\r\n     Austrian army in another campaign as likely to be concentered for\r\n     efforts from the German frontier, by which means they will have a\r\n     more collected force more immediately applying to the Imperial\r\n     dominions, and better suited to the jealousies which they entertain\r\n     of the King of Prussia, but certainly not best adapted to the\r\n     defence of Holland, and the recovery of Brabant.\r\n\r\n     Perhaps I may be considered as carrying these suspicions too far,\r\n     but I own I cannot help fearing too, that the suggestion made by\r\n     them of mortgaging the Low Countries to us, is not as security for\r\n     the money in question in this and the next campaign, is not a _bona\r\n     fide_ offer of their best security, but is considered by them as a\r\n     fresh motive for interesting us in their possession of those\r\n     territories, and as contributing the more to make that object our\r\n     business, by either taking upon ourselves the whole defence of\r\n     them, or, what they rather look to, by our purchasing the cession\r\n     of them at the peace, by some of the acquisitions which Great\r\n     Britain has made in the war: a measure which they may have the more\r\n     hope for our concurrence in, if we have two millions lent out upon\r\n     the security only of the Austrians regaining those territories at\r\n     the peace.\r\n\r\n     Do not believe that these impressions are taken from any starving\r\n     principle of economy, or from a too timid apprehension of the\r\n     unpopularity of a subsidy in England; but be assured, that even if\r\n     there should be no difficulty at home as to this demand being\r\n     acquiesced in, I should retain the same doubts as to any\r\n     expectation of proportionate advantages resulting from it, and\r\n     should be inclined to believe that even if the whole amount of the\r\n     subsidy was to be expended, it might be more advantageously used in\r\n     the purchase of Hessians, Swiss, or any other such troops\r\n     absolutely at our disposal, in addition to the Austrians, than in\r\n     the proposed purchase of increased vigour and activity in the\r\n     government and army of this country: you cannot buy what they have\r\n     not to sell.\r\n\r\n     Sept. 14th, 1791.\r\n\r\n     The former part of this letter had already been written before I\r\n     received yours of the 11th of August, which did not reach me till\r\n     the 2nd instant. I am very sincerely rejoiced to find by it that\r\n     you have made your decision for Ireland, because I believe that\r\n     much good may be done there, by your taking that heavy load upon\r\n     your shoulders; and although you are wanted enough both in London\r\n     and Yorkshire, I am persuaded that for public objects you are still\r\n     most wanted at Dublin. I am not enough acquainted with the interior\r\n     there, to judge how far the means (as Government now stands) are\r\n     competent to the end, or to what degree you may be able to supply\r\n     all those links of connection between the two countries, which have\r\n     latterly appeared to be very much worn away and broken through. I\r\n     presume that it will be found easy enough to continue the same\r\n     negative course of administration, and that it will be a work of\r\n     great difficulty and delicacy for you to do all that you will think\r\n     should be done; I am, therefore, from a strong persuasion of the\r\n     arduousness of the task, well pleased to know that it is in such\r\n     good hands.\r\n\r\n     With respect to my undertaking the office of Secretary, I am very\r\n     far from being confident that I should be able to make myself, in\r\n     that situation, as useful to you as it undoubtedly should be made.\r\n     You know it is not the first moment in which I have expressed my\r\n     doubts as to that employment, since it is twelve years ago that the\r\n     same objections presented themselves to me; and if I still feel the\r\n     weight of them, it is not from any disinclination to pull at my oar\r\n     in the galley, or from any reluctance to take part in public\r\n     measures at a time when I think, as you do, that everything is at\r\n     stake; on the contrary, I confess that, all other considerations\r\n     put apart, I shall be gratified in making myself actively one of a\r\n     system with which the prosperity of the country will, I am\r\n     persuaded, be to stand or fall; and I shall be best gratified by\r\n     doing this in whatever shape it could be hoped that I should be\r\n     serviceable. To foreign mission, I own I know not how to reconcile\r\n     myself; and for Ireland, besides my own disinclination to it, I\r\n     should have thought Pelham better suited, as I have often told you.\r\n     But my own opinion upon this, as upon all other subjects, gives way\r\n     to the better judgment of my friends; and if the Duke of Portland\r\n     and you think, that in the present state of things, I should do\r\n     best to go to Ireland, I cannot say that I will not try it; sure I\r\n     am that your going there gives to the situation every advantage\r\n     which I can receive in it, and that if my engaging in it could\r\n     succeed, it is on every account as promising and gratifying to me\r\n     with you, as the situation itself can be made. Thus, therefore, it\r\n     stands, that my own inclination, if no difficulties stood in the\r\n     way, would rather lead me to any such employment at home as I might\r\n     be fit for, when any such offered itself; but no such destination\r\n     being easily found, if the Duke of Portland and you think it any\r\n     way desirable that I should go to Ireland, I will certainly\r\n     undertake it, and do the best I can in it; trusting always, that if\r\n     hereafter, when you are settled on your Irish throne, the chance of\r\n     events should make any home-situation of business practicable for\r\n     me, you would not object to any such arrangement if it could be\r\n     found.\r\n\r\n     The long delay which has prevented my sending a messenger when I\r\n     wrote the first sheet of this letter, has now so altered the events\r\n     of the negotiation that it is hardly worth sending to you, except\r\n     as a proof that want of opportunity, and not want of punctuality,\r\n     has prevented my letter reaching you at an earlier period.\r\n\r\n     The loss of the fortresses, at a moment when they had been\r\n     reluctantly induced here to make an effort to save them, is\r\n     vexatious in the extreme. They threaten the vengeance of a\r\n     court-martial on the officers who surrendered Valenciennes; but\r\n     what will that avail towards recovering these great objects, which\r\n     were equally material, both to the regaining of the Netherlands,\r\n     and to their security when reconquered?\r\n\r\n     The hopeless inactivity of this Court is too long a theme to write\r\n     upon, and will continue, I fear, to be a fertile source of\r\n     uneasiness. It is shocking to foresee that their assistance may be\r\n     as much wanted to save Holland as it was to save Valenciennes, and\r\n     may likewise be retarded till it is equally ineffectual.\r\n\r\n     I expect to be in England towards the 12th or 15th of November.\r\n\r\n     Ever very faithfully and affectionately yours,\r\n     T. G.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM TO MR. T. GRENVILLE.\r\n\r\n     Camp, Weymouth, Aug. 31st, 1794.\r\n     MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     I have just received your letter of the 16th from Vienna, and am\r\n     glad to find from it that you are as well as I wish you to be, and\r\n     as sanguine as any one could wish who is less desponding than\r\n     myself. I fear that very much of your difficulty is insuperable,\r\n     for I have no idea that it is possible to induce the Imperial\r\n     Government to exert themselves more for the _recovery_ of Brabant\r\n     than they did for the _preservation_ of it. Various circumstances\r\n     (some of which you have stated) co-operated to the scandalous\r\n     dereliction of a country, which all former history proves to us\r\n     might have been defended (even for a losing campaign) with one half\r\n     of the allied force; and it is no part of my creed that the zeal or\r\n     activity of the Austrian Ministry (even if they act with good\r\n     faith) can replace us by the end of November where we were last\r\n     year. But if it is to be proposed to us to add Austria to the list\r\n     of powers subsidized, and to call upon Great Britain, the _ally_ of\r\n     the war, to consider herself as the only principal in it, I fear\r\n     that the proposition will meet with every difficulty, and (if\r\n     acceded to) with as little success as the subsidy paid to Prussia.\r\n     You will then ask me for my solution of this difficulty; and I will\r\n     fairly own that I see none, but in endeavouring to stimulate\r\n     Austria, by showing them clearly that we will not take the whole\r\n     upon our back; and that we can better keep the wolf out of our\r\n     house, than they can out of theirs, if the war is to be defensive.\r\n\r\n     As to the military operations of the Prince of Saxe Coburg, I make\r\n     no doubt that he has done very ill; indeed, it seems difficult to\r\n     conceive that his groom could have done worse. But I fear that the\r\n     ignorance or treachery of the German Generals goes much deeper than\r\n     you imagine, for I do not recollect one instance in the course of\r\n     this campaign--and perhaps not one in the last--in which they\r\n     answered the expectation formed of them. Again, if we imagined that\r\n     by protracting the war we might exhaust the enemy, though I might\r\n     not agree as to the prospect of success, I could understand it as a\r\n     system; but in that case, the war would have been defensive, and\r\n     co-operation settled to that object, instead of abandoning the Duke\r\n     of York to certain ruin, if the winds and the circumstances of this\r\n     country had not permitted Lord Moira's army to arrive just (and\r\n     only just) in time to cover their retreat, and communication. These\r\n     points are all mysterious to us lookers-on, and perhaps not much\r\n     more clear to you at Vienna. The only point clear and indisputable\r\n     is, that we begun the campaign offensively in the south-west point\r\n     without securing West Flanders; that we undertook by defensive\r\n     positions to cover it; and notwithstanding the very slow progress\r\n     of the French, which gave us full and ample time, it was lost for\r\n     want of sufficient force on the western flank of our combined\r\n     force, and for want of co-operation, either of defensive retreat,\r\n     or of mutual support in a systematic evacuation of a country so\r\n     very tenable. Now, if all this is proposed to be cured by changing\r\n     the Commander, and by taking the Austrians into British pay, I fear\r\n     that I shall be one of the first to cry out against such a measure,\r\n     which cannot in the least tend to remove those difficulties, and\r\n     will superinduce many others on the continent, and others more\r\n     serious at home, to which you cannot be a stranger. If the object\r\n     be to add to our force, we do not accomplish it by changing the\r\n     Paymaster or Commander of the troops; but we may obtain a very\r\n     considerable force under our immediate and actual command, by\r\n     adding to the levies of French troops; or, in plain terms, by\r\n     raising an immense French army in British pay, who would not be\r\n     liable to be called off _a la Prussienne_ to schemes of plunder, or\r\n     possibly of home defence, in the moment in which they are the most\r\n     wanted by us. I have taken some pains to get information on this\r\n     subject; and I verily believe, that if we take the small remnant of\r\n     the Prince of Conde's army into our pay, with him at the head of it\r\n     as a foundation, we may in a very short time increase it to\r\n     twenty-five, or perhaps thirty thousand men, which, added to our\r\n     British, Hessian and Hanoverian army, would effectually support the\r\n     Dutch in covering Holland, and would enable us to make a very\r\n     serious diversion either in Normandy or in Poitou.\r\n\r\n     I have written upon this subject more at large than I at first\r\n     intended, but it is very difficult to compress it; and having found\r\n     it difficult to reconcile the conduct of Ministry in the\r\n     management of this campaign to my own feelings, or the plan (so far\r\n     as I understand it from common report) of reconquering Brabant for\r\n     the Emperor by an Austrian army in British pay, or of assisting\r\n     Holland by a force of the same nature on which the experience of\r\n     two campaigns shows how little we can depend, I have not thought it\r\n     fair to withhold these opinions from you, having stated them to my\r\n     other brother as soon as I heard of your mission (and from public\r\n     report of the objects of it) to Vienna. But be assured, my dear\r\n     brother, that I do not feel the less warmly for your credit, and\r\n     for the success of your negotiation (whatever it may be) as far as\r\n     the question is personal to yourself. I have always seen, with very\r\n     sincere regret, your talents useless to the public; and I am happy,\r\n     on every account, that you have found an opportunity of showing\r\n     them in co-operation with my brother William, who seemed so happy\r\n     in this proof of your confidence and affection.\r\n\r\n     I feel, as I ought, your anxiety about the yeomanry. I have the\r\n     satisfaction of hearing that they go on very well, but of course\r\n     meeting very seldom, because of the harvest. Their numbers,\r\n     however, increase; and are, as near as can be, as follows:\r\n\r\n            Captains.    Lieutenants. 2nd ditto. Qr. Masters. Numbers.\r\n     Lt.-Col. Grenville  Fremantle    Grubb      ----         47\r\n              Praed      Mansell      Higgins    Cooch        60\r\n       Sir J. Dashwood   W. Hicks     T. Mason   Clarke       43\r\n              Drake      K. Mason     Clerk      ----         37\r\n          Sir W. Young   Ch. Clowes   L. Way     Quanne       29\r\n\r\n     Most of them have got their swords, and have returned their\r\n     pistols, which were most scandalously bad; they have got their\r\n     appointments, and (except Young's troop) they come on very well. I\r\n     am, however, tied by the leg to Weymouth, while the King is here,\r\n     and cannot stir. He is in wonderful health; but very unruly as to\r\n     the common precautions which ought to be taken, and which keep me\r\n     in constant hot water, notwithstanding our incessant rains. Lord\r\n     Howe passed Portland yesterday with thirty-three sail of the line,\r\n     and three Portuguese ships; of which one ran foul of the\r\n     'Barfleur,' and stove in her bows so as to force her to return to\r\n     Portsmouth. All the sea prisoners lately taken, say, that Barrere\r\n     is determined to force the Brest fleet of thirty-five sail to sea.\r\n     Sir J. B. Warren's last prisoners say, that they were brought from\r\n     the interior to Brest, and embarked _handcuffed_; another account\r\n     states, that sixteen thousand men have been sent to Brest _en\r\n     requisition_, since Lord Howe's action. Our line of battle is\r\n     thirty-seven sail, including what is to join at Plymouth; from\r\n     which deduct two ships not ready, and the 'Barfleur,' his number\r\n     will be thirty-four. He will probably fall in with your friend,\r\n     Lord Macartney, who is coming back with \"_the Emperor's copy of\r\n     verses_,\" and left St. Helena on the 6th of July with nineteen East\r\n     India ships.\r\n\r\n     Adieu, my dear brother,\r\n     Ever most affectionately yours,\r\n     N. B.\r\n\r\n     Sept. 5th, 1794.\r\n\r\n     P.S.--This letter was begun five days ago, but I have been for the\r\n     last four days confined, and very ill from an epidemic, which is\r\n     running all over England. It is not confined to the army, and it\r\n     has not been fatal, but very painful. I have got clear of it, but I\r\n     have above forty men ill of it at this moment. Adieu.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties of the negotiation in which Lord Spencer and Mr. Thomas\r\nGrenville were engaged, are very clearly stated in the following letter.\r\nIt is perfectly evident from these curious revelations, that Austria and\r\nPrussia were pursuing a crooked and evasive policy in their diplomacy\r\nwith England, that the vacillations and infirmity of purpose they\r\nbetrayed left them open to the suspicion of insincerity, and that the\r\naffairs of both Courts were conducted by Ministers utterly deficient in\r\nall qualities of firmness and judgment, which the occasion imperatively\r\ndemanded.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. THOMAS GRENVILLE TO LORD GRENVILLE.\r\n\r\n     (Private.)      Vienna, Sept. 1st, 1794.\r\n     MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     If M. de Thugut is waiting with impatience the result of M. de\r\n     Merey's negotiation, you will easily believe that we have no less\r\n     impatience to know your decisions upon that subject, though you\r\n     will have seen that Lord Spencer and I have not been able to teach\r\n     ourselves to wish that the pecuniary demands may, or ought to be,\r\n     gratified by us. If they had confined themselves to asking only\r\n     such a temporary assistance as might have given a more immediate\r\n     spring to the vigorous movement which we are urging them to make, I\r\n     should have been as little disposed as anybody could to withhold\r\n     any practicable facilities of that description; but to the extent\r\n     to which they steadily continue to point, I own I feel myself too\r\n     little satisfied as to the equity of their claim upon us, and as to\r\n     the probability of their acting fairly and manfully up to the great\r\n     exertions which they ask from us, to entertain much disposition\r\n     towards those demands.\r\n\r\n     They dwell certainly upon the difference which they state between\r\n     loan and subsidy, and wish to prove to us that their offer of\r\n     security upon the revenues of the Low Countries should, at least by\r\n     us (who always insist on those territories remaining in the House\r\n     of Austria), be accepted as a good and ample mortgage for the\r\n     repayment of the sums which they want for this year and the next;\r\n     but if it is true that they do not feel interested at heart in\r\n     these possessions, or if they think us so earnest in our wishes on\r\n     this subject, that they may safely throw the whole weight of it\r\n     upon us, their offer of a _hypotheque_ on those possessions takes a\r\n     much more suspicious character; nor is it, perhaps, an unreasonable\r\n     jealousy on my part to apprehend that they may wish you to have a\r\n     mortgage of two millions on the Netherlands, as an inducement to\r\n     you hereafter to give up some of your French acquisitions in the\r\n     West Indies, in order to recover for them a country, in which you\r\n     will have a larger pecuniary stake, added to the ordinary course of\r\n     political observations.\r\n\r\n     Much at least of Thugut's conversation would seem to tally with\r\n     this view of the matter. It is observable that he perpetually\r\n     recurs to its being a settled point, that _de facon ou d'autre_ the\r\n     Netherlands will be secured to Austria at the peace, and yet he\r\n     never seems (in his view of the military operations to be pursued)\r\n     to consider them as a main object of defence, and is so little\r\n     disposed to make them so, that he expresses much reluctance at the\r\n     idea proposed, of engaging Austria to furnish so large an army, _to\r\n     act in that country_, which he thinks might be better employed\r\n     elsewhere. Add to this, his remarking that England might be\r\n     satisfied by the irrecoverable detriment done to the navy and\r\n     commerce of France, and his contrasting the difference in point of\r\n     acquisitions made by Great Britain, with the total failure on the\r\n     side of Austria; and it is no great refinement to suspect the whole\r\n     of this to lead to an expectation that we may better buy back the\r\n     Netherlands for them, than put them to the expense of defending\r\n     them or regaining them; and that we should have an additional\r\n     motive for sacrificing some of our conquests to this object, if we\r\n     have two millions of money mortgaged upon it.\r\n\r\n     Of the advantage which may be expected at home from adopting this\r\n     shape of lending upon security, rather than of furnishing a direct\r\n     subsidy, I do not well know how to judge; but unless the security\r\n     could be shown to be in itself substantial, and of a nature to be\r\n     easily got at by those to whom it was due, I should doubt whether\r\n     the public at home would be better reconciled to it than to a\r\n     direct and acknowledged subsidy. The very small proportion of\r\n     effect produced by the large payments this year to the King of\r\n     Prussia, will create much indisposition to the incurring of a\r\n     similar expense again, unless it can be shown to promise, upon good\r\n     probable grounds, a much better return than we have had; and,\r\n     generally speaking, I cannot but fear that the mere difference in\r\n     point of exertion which we can hope from this country, may not turn\r\n     out to be worth the purchase-money in the estimation of the country\r\n     at large, though I should hope they might easily acquiesce in a\r\n     very considerable exertion, if a great manifest exertion of\r\n     strength, fairly disposable to the course of the war, could be\r\n     procured by pecuniary aids. What inducement there may be to this\r\n     measure, from any apprehension of the Emperor's withdrawing from\r\n     the war, is another part of the question, upon which I can form no\r\n     more correct judgment than belongs to the observation of a very\r\n     short residence here.\r\n\r\n     Lord Malmesbury hints to me a suspicion of a proposed concert\r\n     between the Emperor and the King of Prussia, to compel the Maritime\r\n     Powers to make peace, though he appears to give no great credit to\r\n     it. Certain it is, that in the month which we have past here, one\r\n     of the most striking features of the conversation, both of\r\n     Ministers and individuals, has been a hatred and aversion to\r\n     Prussia, by Thugut, too, particularly marked towards Lucchesini, of\r\n     whom he never scruples to speak to us in terms of the most\r\n     unqualified dislike; so that as far as can be collected from what\r\n     we hear, there ought to be no ground to suspect any plan of\r\n     intimate concert between his Court and Berlin.\r\n\r\n     It is possible, to be sure, that independently of any such concert,\r\n     the Government here, if unassisted by money from us, might\r\n     endeavour to withdraw from the prosecution of the war; but, as we\r\n     have had no reason to expect any ultimate success to the\r\n     propositions which _we_ brought here, we have endeavoured, as much\r\n     as possible, to learn what their conduct would be in failure of the\r\n     proposed Convention, and to consider them in all that we have said\r\n     as equally bound to continue in their co-operations with us\r\n     according to the existing agreement, whether any new arrangement\r\n     should succeed or not. To this view they have not only acceded\r\n     always in distinct terms, when urged by us, but they have\r\n     frequently stated this of their own accord, confining themselves\r\n     only to the observation, that their means are limited, and will no\r\n     longer allow of the exertions which they wish; but solemnly\r\n     protesting against any present idea of peace, and always expressing\r\n     their belief that Prussia is now desirous of peace being made,\r\n     because, in the present situation of things, it might probably be\r\n     made to the disadvantage of Austria. Unless, therefore, their\r\n     opinions should be disguised to a degree which I cannot well\r\n     believe, or should undergo an entire change, I do not see what\r\n     ground there is to suspect in them any intention of abandoning the\r\n     war, though I can entertain no great hopes of such a vigorous\r\n     prosecution of it as we might wish and expect from them.\r\n\r\n     There is but one opinion as to the Emperor's inclinations on this\r\n     subject, and if his personal character had steadiness enough to\r\n     influence the Government, his disposition to the true principles of\r\n     the war would be a great security to us; at present, however, it is\r\n     of little or no avail; and it is much to be lamented in times like\r\n     the present, that though there is no dislike entertained to him,\r\n     there is not either the respect or consideration which ought to be\r\n     attached to his situation, to make it tell with any of the effects\r\n     one wishes to derive from it. With respect to his Ministers, you\r\n     have seen too much of our remarks upon the striking features of\r\n     their conduct, to make it necessary for me in every letter to\r\n     repeat them. Thugut is certainly the only efficient Minister here:\r\n     very diligent and laborious in his office, he seems to have\r\n     acquired an influence here by being the only man of business about\r\n     the Court; and with this recommendation has reached a situation\r\n     which the nobility of the country are mortified to see him hold,\r\n     because he has no pretensions to hereditary rank, and because they\r\n     have been used to see that office for many years filled by Prince\r\n     Kavnitz. What _we_, however, miss in him is, either the disposition\r\n     or capacity to see the present great crisis of Europe upon the\r\n     large scale on which it should be looked at by the leading Minister\r\n     of this empire; instead of which, we see in all our discussions a\r\n     cold, narrow, and contracted view of this subject, infinitely too\r\n     languid and little for the object, and made peculiarly unfavourable\r\n     to our propositions, by the disinclination which he certainly feels\r\n     to concur heartily with us in the great interests attached to the\r\n     Austrian possession of the Low Countries. We have, it is true,\r\n     obtained from him assurances of concerting an immediate plan for\r\n     the relief of Valenciennes; but even this has not been obtained\r\n     without many discouraging tokens of that total want of manly energy\r\n     and direct dealing, without which all co-operation must necessarily\r\n     be languid and feeble: always taking merit for having sent the most\r\n     distinct orders to try the relief of Valenciennes, yet never taking\r\n     the obvious mode of satisfying us by communicating those orders to\r\n     us; maintaining as an argument for the loan, that without it the\r\n     army cannot move, yet at the same time resisting our objections of\r\n     the delay of waiting for answers from M. de Merey, by stating this\r\n     movement as being actually in great forwardness, and not depending\r\n     upon the loan for its execution; acquiescing in the change of\r\n     command urged by us, and yet ever since that event reminding us\r\n     that in his opinion this very change may defeat the operation which\r\n     we wished to assist by it; gratifying our impatience at one time by\r\n     counting up the days to the probable time of the desired movement,\r\n     and then again stating that Clairfayt's army may be weakened too\r\n     much to attempt it by his detaching, perhaps considerably, towards\r\n     the side of Treves; complaining that the Austrians had been\r\n     prevented from sending Blankenstein's corps towards Flanders, as\r\n     they wished, by the Prussians having engaged it in their line of\r\n     defence, and yet refusing to us a corps much more inconsiderable,\r\n     and not involved in the objection--I mean the corps of Conde--a\r\n     corps, too, which, as I have before observed, from their own\r\n     statement of their want of money, they should have been glad to\r\n     have seen transferred to the pay of another country.\r\n\r\n     These, and many other such traits of inconsistency, I advert to\r\n     only as being descriptive of the very unsatisfactory manner in\r\n     which our business is discussed, always providing on their side\r\n     apologies for future failures, instead of means of success, and\r\n     projects of vigour and enterprize. Yet though the shortness of our\r\n     possible residence here makes this inanimate character of the\r\n     Government a bar to that immediate spirit and alacrity which, for\r\n     the purposes of the present crisis, it was highly desirable to\r\n     create here, so as to act upon instantaneously; much, I should\r\n     suppose, may be done after our return, by any person of steadiness\r\n     and activity, in the course of an established residence here, there\r\n     being certainly fair grounds for the most intimate union between\r\n     the two countries, and appearances enough of general inclination\r\n     towards it, though traversed for the present by their hopes of\r\n     fighting at our cost, and by the unfavourable turn of M. Thugut's\r\n     mind upon the subject of the Netherlands. For this purpose, the\r\n     sooner a regular Minister is appointed here the better; because\r\n     though the opening of the subsequent campaign is at present distant\r\n     enough, the dilatory habits of this Government make every moment\r\n     more precious than it should be; and the points, both of the\r\n     barrier and the Dutch indemnity, may be found longer in discussion\r\n     than they were expected to be when I left London, particularly upon\r\n     the former of those two subjects, on which the future possession\r\n     of Dunkirk and Givet must, perhaps, be distinctly explained.\r\n\r\n     We have heard of Lord Malmesbury's intention to quit Frankfort on\r\n     the 10th of September, and we have read the formal acceptance,\r\n     signed by him, of the military concert of the 26th July; you will\r\n     already have seen, in our despatch No. 5, our apprehensions of the\r\n     inconvenience of placing Clairfayt's army in any state of\r\n     dependance upon the Prussian line, as we are always afraid that the\r\n     Prussians may, by a nominal concert upon this subject, become a\r\n     real hindrance, and throw difficulties in the way of the proposed\r\n     enterprise for the relief of Valenciennes. In this view, therefore,\r\n     we had certainly rather have seen Lord Malmesbury remaining at\r\n     least till the movement in question had actually been carried into\r\n     effect; and the more so, as we have always kept their fears a\r\n     little quiet here, by promising that Lord Malmesbury, at Frankfort,\r\n     should look to and strictly watch the operations of Marshal\r\n     Mollendorff's army. I take for granted, however, that you will\r\n     provide as well as you can against the inconveniences which in this\r\n     shape may arise, and we shall likewise mention it to Lord M.\r\n\r\n     Ever, my dear brother,\r\n     Most affectionately yours,\r\n     T. G.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. THOMAS GRENVILLE TO LORD GRENVILLE.\r\n\r\n     (Private.)      Vienna, Sept. 15th, 1794.\r\n     MY DEAREST BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     You will receive enclosed with this a letter, which I had already\r\n     written before the arrival of your last despatches, and which can\r\n     only be useful by showing you all that occurred to me upon the\r\n     former view of the subject. The conditions which are now attached\r\n     to the two questions of loan and subsidy, appear certainly to be\r\n     the best which could have been imagined for promising a fair use of\r\n     the troops for which we are desired to pay, and would probably\r\n     appear to the country to be so, besides really furnishing all the\r\n     means which can be supplied to this great stake which we are\r\n     compelled to play for. What has passed upon these propositions, you\r\n     will have seen pretty amply in the public despatch, which is\r\n     written so much at length as to require no great additional\r\n     comment. It is manifest, that instead of complying with all the\r\n     conditions proposed, they could not easily be brought to consent to\r\n     any one of them. Upon the subject of command, there is a soreness\r\n     which would be an insuperable bar to the idea of a large combined\r\n     force (chiefly Austrian) acting under any English General; and yet\r\n     there is so little hope of their acting vigorously under any other,\r\n     that the choice lies between two extreme difficulties.\r\n\r\n     Under the pressure of your letter, which led us to imagine that\r\n     Lord Cornwallis is actually gone to Flanders, we have done and said\r\n     all that was in any shape likely to assist his situation there; at\r\n     the same time, from Wyndham's letter, and from the fall of\r\n     Valenciennes, it is possible that his journey may still have been\r\n     delayed. Instead, therefore, of writing to him in Flanders, as you\r\n     suggested, we have given a letter for him to Colonel Ross, who will\r\n     find him either on this or the other side of the water, and will be\r\n     best able to communicate to him whatever intelligence from hence it\r\n     is material for him to know.\r\n\r\n     They do not talk heartily here of Clairfayt's co-operating, though\r\n     they do not plainly refuse it; and I fear it is but too likely that\r\n     they will satisfy their dignity by keeping their army entirely\r\n     distinct from ours, a determination which may perhaps but too much\r\n     assist the views of the French, if they really make a vigorous\r\n     attack upon Holland. All that we could do by threats, entreaties,\r\n     and remonstrances, on this very important point we have done, and\r\n     will continue to repeat while we stay here.\r\n\r\n     Upon the subject of transferring the subsidy, I believe they are in\r\n     earnest when they say it is out of their power to engage for any\r\n     considerable subsidy from the empire to the King of Prussia; and if\r\n     it is true that they are now under the necessity of ascertaining\r\n     what are their means for the next campaign, it may be true that\r\n     they cannot act upon the uncertain speculation of receiving so much\r\n     from us as they could promise for the King of Prussia. I know not\r\n     whether I am right, but I have thought once or twice that Thugut\r\n     has spoken with some marks of dislike to-day to Comte Stahremberg,\r\n     whom he appears to suspect of having broached this proposition at\r\n     London; to prevent any confirmation of this suspicion, we have not\r\n     in any manner quoted Comte Stahremberg in our conferences; and as I\r\n     believe you are satisfied with him, I hope I misinterpret the word\r\n     or two which Thugut dropped upon this matter.\r\n\r\n     We are come back again (upon the failure of our overtures) to the\r\n     hearing of a reduced scale of military operations, an idea more\r\n     like a haberdasher of small wares than the Minister of a great\r\n     empire. What the supposed plan of this _contracted_ war is to be, I\r\n     never have been able to learn; and, indeed, it requires all the\r\n     good temper one can muster to make so discouraging an inquiry.\r\n\r\n     Meanwhile, orders are said to be already issued for raising sixty\r\n     thousand new recruits in the hereditary states of Austria, but no\r\n     hopes are given of assistance from Hungary, where the harvest has\r\n     been, in many places, uncommonly deficient.\r\n\r\n     We have done what we could to urge them to be active in Sardinia,\r\n     now the French appear to be retiring; and though an invincible\r\n     prejudice to that quarter prevents Thugut from doing all he might,\r\n     yet he expresses a readiness to concur in an attack upon Nice, if\r\n     the English fleet would co-operate, as soon as the equinoctial\r\n     snows have fallen to guard the mountains of the Milanes.\r\n\r\n     There are, however, bad reports of Kosciusko declaring war against\r\n     Austria, which will be both a reason and a pretext for suspending\r\n     enterprise, if any would otherwise be undertaken. The Duc de Guiche\r\n     has a project of collecting the Gardes du Corps, of which he says\r\n     he thinks he could soon muster twelve hundred. He and the French\r\n     here are grown very anxious about Comte d'Artois' journey to\r\n     Rotterdam. We expect impatiently to hear from you of our return.\r\n\r\n     With respect to Vienna, Lord Spencer having considered this\r\n     business as now come to a point, which requires some new shape and\r\n     fresh regular negotiation, writes to request leave to return home,\r\n     and only waits for it to set out immediately. In that request\r\n     (after all the consideration which I can give to it) I feel that I\r\n     must likewise beg to be included, so as to return with him at the\r\n     same time. The line of foreign mission is one to which I own I\r\n     cannot reconcile myself; it leads certainly to a claim for future\r\n     competency, but it seems to me little likely to assist those views\r\n     of honest ambition, which are certainly, though I hope to no\r\n     improper degree, still more forward in my mind than those of\r\n     emolument. In this view it was, that upon a former occasion of\r\n     arrangement, I had declined the Hague, which certainly is the first\r\n     of all the situations in that line, but which still has the\r\n     objection of banishing from all connections, social as well as\r\n     political, and of cutting across all other expectations except\r\n     those of an invalid upon half-pay.\r\n\r\n     I believe I need not tell you, that upon the proposition which you\r\n     suggest of my staying here only to make the detail of the new\r\n     arrangements for next year, I certainly would not have refused it,\r\n     if I had thought that I could more usefully transact that point for\r\n     you; but I am really firmly persuaded, that the only chance of any\r\n     good being done here, is by some active and intelligent man\r\n     _taking root here_, and acquiring over these Ministers by the\r\n     vigour and perseverance of his own mind, influence enough to supply\r\n     the total want of it in theirs; but as this must be a work of some\r\n     time, so it seems highly important that it should immediately be\r\n     undertaken in that regular established shape in which alone it is\r\n     likely to succeed, and to which I could very little contribute by\r\n     protracting my departure two or three months beyond that of Lord\r\n     Spencer; besides, too, that if Ireland is to be looked at, I have\r\n     not much time to lose with a view to that subject. Certainly no man\r\n     can be more sensible than I am to the _desagremens_ of the Irish\r\n     Secretaryship; and if the political arrangements which have taken\r\n     place, had admitted of my occupying any situation of business at\r\n     home, there is scarce any which I should not prefer to it. I am,\r\n     however, very ready to confess, that at the present moment I do not\r\n     see any such opening likely to be easily made; and, therefore, the\r\n     question is as with respect to myself, whether, even with all my\r\n     dislike to the situation, it may not be right that I should take\r\n     it, and trust to the course of events to supply hereafter some\r\n     other situation more eligible. What much inclines me to this is,\r\n     that I shall be able to preserve a much nearer and closer\r\n     connection with my family and friends, whom I shall at times have\r\n     an opportunity of seeing, and that the business itself may become\r\n     in one light highly interesting to me, if I see in it the means of\r\n     making myself essentially useful upon a subject certainly not\r\n     unimportant.\r\n\r\n     I am not without considerable apprehensions, as you know, with\r\n     respect to the practicability of all that in theory one wishes to\r\n     be done in that country; but of those difficulties, it is useless\r\n     now to speak. Upon the whole, therefore, I have thought it best to\r\n     accept of Lord Fitzwilliam's offer, and have accordingly written to\r\n     say so.\r\n\r\n     I will not unnecessarily add to this letter, as I expect to see you\r\n     so soon: we calculate that in about twenty-six days we shall\r\n     receive from you our answer, with permission to return; and that we\r\n     shall be enabled to set out between the 15th and 20th of October at\r\n     latest. Happy, indeed, I am to find, by the conclusion of your\r\n     letter, that everything is going on at home upon as good a footing\r\n     as we could wish. Every day's experience confirms me in the\r\n     conviction, that with the present arrangement of Government, the\r\n     peace and prosperity of the country must stand and fall; and\r\n     however threatening may be the prospect from without, as long as\r\n     everything keeps so right within, I shall continue to be of good\r\n     heart.\r\n\r\n     I am ashamed of having written so much about myself, or rather I\r\n     should be so if I was not writing to you; but I have confidence in\r\n     your kindness and affection.\r\n\r\n     God bless you, my dear brother.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. THOMAS GRENVILLE TO THE DUKE OF PORTLAND.\r\n\r\n     (Private.)      Vienna, Sept. 15th, 1794.\r\n     DEAR DUKE OF PORTLAND,\r\n\r\n     The impatience which we know that you must all have in England to\r\n     hear the result of your last determinations, leaves me no time to\r\n     add to what is contained in our despatches; but having had occasion\r\n     to write to Lord Fitzwilliam upon his having offered to me and\r\n     pressed upon me the Secretaryship in Ireland, I cannot let the\r\n     messenger go without a few words likewise to you upon that subject,\r\n     to tell you that I have left that to your decision and to his;\r\n     having only added such expressions of my own views and inclinations\r\n     as I know your friendship for me will lead you to view in their\r\n     proper light. My objections to the situation of Secretary in\r\n     Ireland you very well know, because even all my desire of making\r\n     myself useful to you could not, twelve years ago, overcome those\r\n     objections. I am, however, so persuaded that, in this moment, it is\r\n     every man's duty to take his task without consulting his\r\n     inclination, that if, all things considered, you agree with Lord\r\n     Fitzwilliam in thinking that I had best go to Ireland, I will\r\n     certainly try it.\r\n\r\n     You will, I am sure, forgive me for adding that, if the future\r\n     course of political arrangements (according as facilities may\r\n     occur) should admit of my being usefully employed at home, my wish\r\n     and preference to any such arrangement will not, I am sure, be\r\n     overlooked by my friends in England.\r\n\r\n     Ever, my dear Duke,\r\n     Most sincerely yours,\r\n     T. G.\r\n\r\nThat some inconvenience had already arisen, and that more was yet likely\r\nto arise, from the nomination of Lord Fitzwilliam to the government of\r\nIreland, will be seen from a letter addressed by Lord Grenville to his\r\nbrother at Vienna. It had been clearly understood all along, that Lord\r\nFitzwilliam's appointment could not be confirmed until some suitable\r\nprovision should have been made for Lord Westmoreland, who had accepted\r\nthe office of Lord-Lieutenant on that express condition; yet the friends\r\nof Lord Fitzwilliam, in their eagerness to make known the accession of\r\ntheir party to power amongst their allies in Ireland, committed the\r\nindiscretion of talking publicly about the approaching change, before\r\nany arrangements had been concluded, or could be concluded, respecting\r\nLord Westmoreland. The immediate effect of these premature announcements\r\nwas to embarrass the Cabinet, and irritate the feelings and compromise\r\nthe position of the Lord-Lieutenant. Worse effects followed soon\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD GRENVILLE TO MR. THOMAS GRENVILLE.\r\n\r\n     Sept. 15th, 1794.\r\n     MY DEAREST BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     I am so late, that I have hardly time to write this private letter\r\n     to you, nor, indeed, have I much to add to my despatches.\r\n\r\n     There is, however, one point which it is material that you should\r\n     know for your own satisfaction. The despatches, as now drawn, bear\r\n     very much the appearance of contracted operations in Flanders,\r\n     without any very distinct statement of an intention to extend our\r\n     plans elsewhere. The reason is, that we doubt whether we ought to\r\n     trust the Government at Vienna with our secret in this respect. The\r\n     failure of our expected operations in Flanders, where we had hoped\r\n     to engage the principal attention of the enemy for the next month,\r\n     makes it impossible to try, with the small force of which we now\r\n     have the disposal, any operations of consequence in the Vendee; and\r\n     a weak and ineffectual effort there would both betray and dispirit\r\n     those whom we wish to support. We have therefore, for the present,\r\n     renounced the idea of doing more than barely trying to throw in\r\n     arms and supplies; and we reserve our attack for the spring, when,\r\n     if our present expectations do not deceive us, we shall have the\r\n     means of disposing of a very large force, independent of _emigres_,\r\n     &c.\r\n\r\n     In this way, the two parts of the war will operate as a diversion\r\n     one to the other, and we shall be able to push that, whichever it\r\n     may be, when we shall appear at the time most likely to succeed.\r\n     That will probably be the quarter where we act alone, and have\r\n     neither to depend on Prussian faith nor Austrian energy.\r\n\r\n     It is in the meantime discouraging to see how fair an opportunity\r\n     is lost by our not being able to profit of the present state of\r\n     things in France. God knows what may happen between this and the\r\n     spring. It does not appear to me that there is any foundation for\r\n     the report of the young King's death. If it was true, it would\r\n     solve at once the question of the acknowledgment of the Regent,\r\n     which Spain has formally proposed to us.\r\n\r\n     You will have received my letter on the point on which you asked my\r\n     opinion. If the decision is likely to go in favour of Ireland, I\r\n     heartily wish you were here, as I am afraid that there is less\r\n     discretion on that subject than there should be. The intended\r\n     successor to Lord W. is talked of more openly than I think useful,\r\n     at a time when there is yet no arrangement made for his quitting\r\n     his station. But what is worse than that, ideas are going about,\r\n     and are much encouraged in Dublin, of _new systems_ there, and of\r\n     changes of men and measures. Whatever it may be prudent to _do_ in\r\n     that respect, I know that you will agree with me that, till the\r\n     time comes when that question is to be considered, with a view to\r\n     acting upon it immediately, the less is _said_ about it the better,\r\n     in every point of view. When I see you, we can talk this over more\r\n     easily than by letters between Vienna and London; and yet I have\r\n     heard so much of it lately, that I almost wish it were possible for\r\n     you, even at that distance, to write something that might suggest\r\n     the necessity of caution; and that something you might even ground\r\n     upon the paragraphs in the papers, which, as you may have seen,\r\n     have been full of speculations upon it, particularly since\r\n     Ponsonby's journey here.\r\n\r\n     The notion of seeing your personal quiet and happiness committed in\r\n     this business, makes me feel more anxious about it than I otherwise\r\n     should, though it is otherwise sufficiently important, and that in\r\n     more than one point of view.\r\n\r\n     God bless you, my dearest brother, and believe me\r\n\r\n     Ever most affectionately yours,\r\n     G.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     St. James's Square, Sept. 17th, 1794.\r\n     MY DEAREST BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     I have forwarded your letter to Tom, who will, I think, probably\r\n     set out from Vienna soon after the receipt of it. I should have\r\n     been very glad if I could have engaged him to stay there, but that,\r\n     I think, seems out of the question. I am not more sanguine in his\r\n     success than he is himself; and if my conjecture is right, at least\r\n     you will have the satisfaction of knowing that a subsidy is not\r\n     given to Austria. I own myself that if the situation of affairs\r\n     there had been such that one could, with propriety, have been\r\n     given, with a reasonable hope of adequate exertion in return, I\r\n     should never have signed any other instrument with as much pleasure\r\n     as the warrant for ratifying that agreement, whatever had been the\r\n     consequences of it. I have no other view of the contest in which we\r\n     are engaged, nor ever have had, than that the existence of the two\r\n     systems of Government is fairly at stake, and in the words of St.\r\n     Just, whose curious speech I hope you have seen, that it is perfect\r\n     blindness not to see that in the establishment of the French\r\n     Republic is included the overthrow of all the other Governments of\r\n     Europe. If this view of the subject is just, there can be worse\r\n     economy than that which spares the expense of present exertion, and\r\n     incurs the probability of increased risk, and the necessity of\r\n     protracted efforts. I believe, however, that all this reasoning\r\n     applies, in this instance at least, to a case which will not exist.\r\n\r\n     Our letters from Holland yesterday announced the execution of\r\n     Barrere and Co.; but so many false reports have come from thence,\r\n     that I do not give much faith to this, except from the probability\r\n     of the thing itself. The weakness which this state of things at\r\n     Paris occasions, in their efforts in the Low Countries, is very\r\n     encouraging, and would be much more so, if we were but in a\r\n     situation to profit of it.\r\n\r\n     Mulgrave's expedition has, I believe, completely performed its\r\n     object, and averted all danger for the present from that quarter.\r\n     The corps will now be broken up. In that event, Nugent has been\r\n     thought of to go to the West Indies with the command of a brigade,\r\n     and the local rank of Brigadier-General. I have taken it for\r\n     granted that this will be a thing agreeable to him, and have\r\n     therefore promoted it as far as I could, because it gives him the\r\n     opportunities of showing himself both in service and in command. If\r\n     you see it in the same light, perhaps, you would prefer throwing\r\n     out the idea to him before it is formally proposed to him, as he\r\n     might have difficulty in declining any proposal of service, even if\r\n     for any reason that I do not foresee this destination was not\r\n     agreeable to him.\r\n\r\n     I rejoice to think that your King's guard is almost over, which I\r\n     imagine must have been a troublesome business enough.\r\n\r\n     God bless you, my dearest brother.\r\n\r\nThe straw was now beginning to move in the direction of Ireland. Mr.\r\nPonsonby and his friends made no concealment of the expectations they\r\nfounded upon the advent of Lord Fitzwilliam; and reports were creeping\r\nout, that with the change of men would come an entire change of\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Dropmore, Sept. 27th, 1794.\r\n     MY DEAREST BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     I received your letter here yesterday, and write this because what\r\n     you say on two material points of the public situation of affairs,\r\n     impels me to it, though I well know how impossible it is within the\r\n     compass of a letter to discuss such questions, or even to state the\r\n     mere grounds of the considerations on which they depend. I see so\r\n     much all around us of the gloomiest colour, that I am on that\r\n     account, perhaps, more sensible to the manner in which you seem to\r\n     view our situation. I cannot, however, be much surprised at the\r\n     confidence which you seem to feel as to the possibility of our\r\n     seeing the storm break all round us, and remaining untouched by it,\r\n     because such appears to be the prevailing sentiment here, as well\r\n     as in every other part of Europe: every country, and almost every\r\n     individual, seeming to reason and to act in the hope of such an\r\n     exception being made in their favour during the general ruin which\r\n     they see impending over others. I am, however, not the less\r\n     convinced of the truth of my own opinion, which is unhappily\r\n     already confirmed by too many instances of the effects which this\r\n     delusive security, as I think it, has produced, and is daily\r\n     producing. I can see no grounds, in the state of this country, to\r\n     hope for such an exception in our favour, and I do verily believe\r\n     that we must prepare to meet the storm here, and that we must not\r\n     count upon the continuance of a state of domestic tranquillity\r\n     which has already lasted so much beyond the period usually allotted\r\n     to it in the course of human events. I trust that we shall at least\r\n     meet it with more firmness than our neighbours, but even in order\r\n     to do this, we ought not to blind ourselves at the moment of its\r\n     approach. It seems too probable that it is decreed by Providence\r\n     that a stop should be put (for reasons probably inscrutable to us)\r\n     to the progress of arts and civilization among us. It is a\r\n     melancholy reflection to be born to the commencement of such a\r\n     scene, and to be called to bear a principal share in it, but I\r\n     trust we may hope that our strength may be proportioned to our\r\n     trial.\r\n\r\n     With respect to what you say of Ireland, I am not ignorant of the\r\n     reports upon the subject, though perhaps a little mortified at the\r\n     facility with which you seem to have given credit to them. I know\r\n     of no such measure as you say we _have adopted_. I have never\r\n     varied in my opinion as to the impolicy of the conduct held in\r\n     Ireland during the time of Lord Rockingham's Administration, nor\r\n     do I believe that any one is disposed to repeat that conduct now.\r\n     On the other hand, I must say that I think we, least of all people,\r\n     and yourself less than any man existing, have reason to feel any\r\n     particular interest in a system which experience has always shown,\r\n     at least in our time, to be neither able nor disposed to carry any\r\n     support to English Government whenever England can think such\r\n     support material. It has long appeared to me, and I believe to you\r\n     also, that to make the connexion with Ireland permanently useful to\r\n     Great Britain, that connexion must be strengthened by a systematic\r\n     plan of measures, well considered and steadily pursued. Whether the\r\n     present moment, or any other moment that is in near prospect, would\r\n     be favourable to such a plan, is another and a more difficult\r\n     question; but I am sure that every year that is lost increases the\r\n     hazard of our situation as with respect to Ireland. These points I\r\n     feel as those which are truly important to England, are not\r\n     questions of power or advantage to Lord Shannon, or Mr. Ponsonby,\r\n     or any other individual, or set of individuals there. And with this\r\n     impression, I certainly have not for one consented, as you express\r\n     it, to surrender Ireland to the Duke of P. and Lord F. under the\r\n     government of Mr. Ponsonby; but neither can I conceive what other\r\n     interest you or I have, or ought to have, on that subject, except\r\n     that Ireland should be so managed, if possible, as not to be an\r\n     additional difficulty in our way, when so many others are likely to\r\n     occur.\r\n\r\n     I have not often as much leisure as I have found to-day to put\r\n     these ideas on paper. Do not think me dispirited by what has\r\n     happened. I see the extent of our danger, and think that danger\r\n     much greater than it is commonly apprehended; but the effect of\r\n     that opinion on my mind is no other than that of increasing the\r\n     conviction with which I was before impressed, of the necessity of\r\n     perseverance and exertion. France and Spain and the Netherlands,\r\n     and Geneva, most of all (small as it is), show us that this danger\r\n     is not to be lessened by giving way to it, but that courage and\r\n     resolution are in this instance, as in most others, the surest\r\n     roads to self-preservation.\r\n\r\n     I have written this with more than usual seriousness, because such\r\n     is the state of my mind, which I am accustomed to open to you\r\n     without reserve, and such as it is at the moment of my writing or\r\n     conversing with you.\r\n\r\n     When are we likely to meet? I suppose that your campaign will not\r\n     last much beyond the King's journey. You will not, I hope, forget\r\n     that this place is your best inn, whether you go to Stowe or to\r\n     town; but you must give me a few days' notice, that I may be sure\r\n     to be here. God bless you.\r\n\r\nThe progress of the negotiations on the continent, and the weakness of\r\nAustria and Prussia, mixed up with no inconsiderable amount of\r\nindecision and duplicity, are freely commented upon in letters from Mr.\r\nGrenville and Lord Malmesbury. Want of power, and want of will--fear,\r\nhesitation, and imbecility--were so conspicuous in the conduct of these\r\nCourts, as to destroy all confidence in their professions. The character\r\ndrawn by Lord Malmesbury of the King of Prussia--which the reader will\r\nfind confirmed in the subsequent communications of Mr. Grenville--shows\r\nhow little reliance, under any circumstances, could be placed on His\r\nMajesty's co-operation.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. THOMAS GRENVILLE TO LORD GRENVILLE.\r\n\r\n     (Private.)      Vienna, Sept. 22nd, 1794.\r\n     MY DEAREST BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     The course of this last week has been employed--as you will have\r\n     seen from our despatch--in very long, but fruitless arguments on\r\n     our parts. The proposal which we send to you, has no other\r\n     recommendation than that of its having been strenuously resisted\r\n     by us, and steadily persisted in by them. If the fact really was,\r\n     as they are disposed to consider it, that England--at no risk and\r\n     no expense--could, in the shape of this guarantee, furnish means to\r\n     Austria, without which they must consider themselves as beat, and\r\n     act too under that impression, to their own certain ruin, and to\r\n     the great probable danger of Holland; if, I say, all this mischief\r\n     could be prevented without any real expense to England, the\r\n     question would seem to me very different from what it now is. But,\r\n     I confess, that I have not been able to make out of their\r\n     conversation on this subject any of that security on these points\r\n     which they must insist upon. They say, provision can be made by\r\n     which the interest of this money can be punctually secured, to be\r\n     paid strictly when due to the commissaries of the English army, or\r\n     any other persons appointed to receive it; yet what those\r\n     provisions are which provide for that security, I do not make out,\r\n     nor do they seem able to describe. I state to them that Mr. Pitt\r\n     must find ways and means for the payment of the interest of this\r\n     loan, which must increase the first shape of our annual expenses,\r\n     whether they are afterwards honestly repaid or not; but they\r\n     maintain that M. Desardroui can settle this somehow or other,\r\n     though how they have not by any means explained; perhaps M.\r\n     Desardroui has been more fortunate with Mr. Pitt.\r\n\r\n     One considerable difficulty in regard to this proposition seems to\r\n     be the influence which this loan might have upon their wish to\r\n     regain the Low Countries--a wish which we already think too weak in\r\n     their minds, and which would probably become weaker from the\r\n     reflection that the income of those revenues was already mortgaged\r\n     for a considerable sum. It was with a view to this that I dropped\r\n     to them the notion of their giving a larger security, and asking a\r\n     smaller loan, as well as complying with the requisitions of\r\n     augmented force and British command. The general security you see\r\n     they do consent to give; but, until I hear some more distinct\r\n     explanation, I shall still fear that they mean to throw the whole\r\n     security upon the Netherlands. They are still quarrelling more\r\n     every day with everything that is Prussian: they have stopped a\r\n     large magazine of blue cloth from Prussia to Switzerland, which\r\n     they say they know is destined to France; and the King of Prussia\r\n     threatens, in consequence, to stop some of their supplies in their\r\n     passage to their armies. Thugut said of the King of Prussia to-day,\r\n     with some truth and some humour, that all he wanted was to save the\r\n     whole of his army, to conquer Poland without the loss of a man, and\r\n     in reward to receive from us a pension of a million and a half per\r\n     annum. If half that sum would purchase from him thirty thousand\r\n     troops absolutely at our disposal, to make with British, Hessian\r\n     and Dutch an army under English orders of one hundred thousand men,\r\n     for the side of Holland; and that the other half--viz.:\r\n     L700,000--given in the way of subsidy to Austria, could give it\r\n     good heart to make a vigorous offensive campaign, I know not\r\n     whether my inclinations would not lead me to the experiment; but\r\n     their wants here are so great, and their resources, or at least\r\n     their spirit and exertions, so reduced, that the prospect is\r\n     certainly very discouraging. They seem full of new fears about the\r\n     Turks, and express much expectation that our Minister at\r\n     Constantinople will make great efforts to keep all quiet there.\r\n\r\n     I believe I told you there were apprehensions of the Poles, under\r\n     Kosciusko, breaking with the Austrians. A small affair had taken\r\n     place, but it is said to be amicably settled, and to be, for the\r\n     present, safe on that side. We are anxiously expecting our\r\n     permission to return; and I depend now upon seeing you so soon,\r\n     that I will not unnecessarily protract this letter.\r\n\r\n     I know not who you are sending here; but we have taken great pains\r\n     to keep alive in them here the most favourable dispositions that we\r\n     could; and as far as appearances can be depended on--if the\r\n     pecuniary demands were out of the question--nothing can be more\r\n     promising than their general language and professions are, of\r\n     earnestly desiring to establish the most intimate union between the\r\n     two Courts.\r\n\r\n     God bless you, my dearest brother.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD MALMESBURY TO MR. THOMAS GRENVILLE.\r\n\r\n     Frankfort, Oct. 2nd, 1794.\r\n     DEAR GRENVILLE,\r\n\r\n     I have written to Lord Spencer all I have to write officially. I\r\n     fear I have mixed up a little bile with my intelligence; but the\r\n     times are bilious, and it is beyond the compass of my patience to\r\n     see the great stake we are playing for lost by imbecility,\r\n     treachery, and neglect, without betraying a few symptoms of\r\n     discontent. It is really deplorable that we should be the only\r\n     nation in Europe who are up to the danger of the moment, and that\r\n     the minds of all the other Cabinets are either so tainted with\r\n     false principles, or are so benumbed, that it is impossible to work\r\n     upon them. It is manifest, from the most undoubted information,\r\n     that the interior of France is in a state of the greatest disorder\r\n     and confusion; that the successes of the armies are the only cause\r\n     of this confusion not breaking out in the shape of a civil war; and\r\n     that if we could at this moment obtain any one brilliant success,\r\n     that the whole fabric would fall to pieces.\r\n\r\n     It is said that H. P. M. will come here, and that when he does\r\n     come, things will take another turn. I doubt one and the other. Any\r\n     means will be employed at Berlin to keep him there, and if these\r\n     should not succeed, any means will be employed here to persuade him\r\n     to approve all that has been done, and to follow up the same line\r\n     of conduct. I know from experience the weakness of his character,\r\n     and the facility with which he gives way to the last advice. I know\r\n     also by experience that his assurances cannot be depended on, and\r\n     that his conduct does not always correspond with his promises. It\r\n     is from your mission and from your Court that I expect any good. I\r\n     am free to confess (still under the influence of that vile thing\r\n     called experience) that my hopes are not very sanguine.\r\n\r\n     Lord Howe is returned to Torbay. This is all I hear from England.\r\n     Nobody writes to me, since everybody supposes me on the road. Mr.\r\n     Braddye gave me your letter an hour ago, I will do all I can to\r\n     make Frankfort pleasant to him, but this is almost as impossible as\r\n     to make the Prussians act.\r\n\r\n     I probably shall be here still a fortnight. I will write again\r\n     soon.\r\n\r\n     Ever yours most truly and sincerely,\r\n     MALMESBURY.\r\n\r\nThe curious revelations that are made in the next letter respecting\r\nIreland are of infinite value in enabling us to estimate correctly the\r\nevents that afterwards took place in that country under Lord\r\nFitzwilliam's government, and the circumstances which led to its abrupt\r\ntermination. Two important facts are authenticated in this\r\ncommunication: the first, that Lord Fitzwilliam, before he assumed the\r\ngovernment, and even before his appointment to it was advanced so far as\r\nthe removal of his predecessor, had not only determined upon the\r\nintroduction of a new system, involving extensive changes of policy and\r\npersons, but that he had made known his determination to the heads of\r\nthat party in Ireland who had obstructed Lord Buckingham on the Regency\r\nquestion; and the second, that this determination was formed without any\r\nprevious concert with Mr. Pitt and the Cabinet, and to a great extent in\r\nopposition to their known and avowed principles.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD GRENVILLE TO MR. THOMAS GRENVILLE.\r\n\r\n     (Private.) Dover Street, Oct. 15th, 1794.\r\n     MY DEAREST BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     I think it probable that you may receive with this letter, others\r\n     mentioning to you the unhappy misunderstanding which has clouded\r\n     all our prospects, and which seems to threaten the worst\r\n     consequences to that system, from the permanence of which I had\r\n     looked, as you did, for the safety of this country, under all the\r\n     difficulties of our present situation. Everything has continued up\r\n     to this hour to go on in the most satisfactory manner, with the\r\n     single exception of this unfortunate subject of Ireland, which now\r\n     is brought to that sort of point which must, as I fear, unavoidably\r\n     produce the immediate dissolution of the union, which we were both\r\n     so anxious to maintain and perpetuate.\r\n\r\n     It would be difficult for me to give you an exact account how this\r\n     mischief has originated, because I am of course ignorant of the\r\n     manner in which the Duke of P. and Lord F. received the\r\n     impressions, on which they appear to have acted. About the time I\r\n     wrote my last letter to you, or rather earlier, reports came round\r\n     to Pitt and myself that the party who had acted in opposition in\r\n     Ireland, and particularly Ponsonby and Grattan, had held the\r\n     strongest language respecting assurances received by them from the\r\n     Duke of P. and Lord F., that the latter was immediately to be\r\n     declared Lord-Lieutenant, that Mr. Pitt had given Ireland over\r\n     entirely to them, and that a new system of measures and men was to\r\n     be adopted. In these reports particular persons were mentioned as\r\n     being to be dismissed, and amongst these the Chancellor. The only\r\n     impression which these produced on my mind was, that Lord F. had\r\n     talked too soon of his intended appointment, as it had been\r\n     uniformly explained that he could not be named till some provision\r\n     was found for Lord W., the fact being that when the latter went to\r\n     Ireland he accepted that situation, on an express engagement that\r\n     he should return to one not less advantageous than the Post-Office,\r\n     which he then quitted. I imagined also that in his communications\r\n     with persons, whose support to a new Government in Ireland we all\r\n     wished to secure, he had been less guarded than he might have been,\r\n     and had given in his conversation more way to ideas stated by them\r\n     than it could be prudent to do. And in this impression I wrote to\r\n     you, thinking all the rest to proceed only from the usual\r\n     exaggeration of reports of this nature, particularly in Ireland;\r\n     and feeling confident that before any measure was really determined\r\n     upon, we should have an opportunity of discussing it fully, and of\r\n     weighing the proposed advantages of it against the very great\r\n     objections which naturally and at first sight occur.\r\n\r\n     Soon after this we heard that Lord F. had actually taken such steps\r\n     in Ireland as marked his persuasion of his being immediately to be\r\n     appointed, and as gave on that account great offence to Lord W., to\r\n     whom no communication of that nature had yet been made on our part,\r\n     because we saw no such opening as it would have been necessary to\r\n     hold out to him when such communication was made.\r\n\r\n     While we were doubting what step it might be best to take on this\r\n     subject, to avoid giving any ground of uneasiness or\r\n     dissatisfaction, the Duke of P. wrote to Pitt to urge the immediate\r\n     appointment of Lord F. as a thing already determined upon, and\r\n     without taking any notice of the necessity of the previous\r\n     arrangement for Lord W. This led to intercourse upon the subject,\r\n     and it is only since that time that we have found ourselves\r\n     apprized of all the difficulties of the subject, and of the extent\r\n     of the misunderstanding which prevails respecting it.\r\n\r\n     It appears that Lord F. has (on whatever grounds) announced to his\r\n     friends in Ireland his immediate destination for that country, in\r\n     such a manner as makes him now think that his appointment cannot\r\n     even be postponed without discredit to himself, and that he cannot\r\n     any longer continue in the King's service in any other situation\r\n     than that of Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland.\r\n\r\n     If this difficulty stood alone, it would be sufficiently great. The\r\n     principle on which Pitt had always acted in forming this junction,\r\n     and the justification which he has used to those of his friends who\r\n     disapproved or doubted about the measure, was, that he sacrificed\r\n     to it the situation of none of the former Government, or its\r\n     supporters; but that he used such openings as presented themselves,\r\n     and such as he could create without removals, for the purpose of\r\n     bringing into the public service a large and respectable\r\n     description of persons, actuated by the same view as himself of the\r\n     present state and circumstances of the country. Yet it hardly seems\r\n     possible that, without breaking in upon this principle, Lord F.\r\n     could now be appointed. I am, however, persuaded that if this had\r\n     been the only difficulty, some expedient would have been found to\r\n     remove it, though it is not easy to say what that expedient could\r\n     have been. But certainly for such an object as the maintenance of a\r\n     system on which the fate of the country seems so much to rest,\r\n     great sacrifices would and ought to have been made.\r\n\r\n     But it now appears that the reports which had reached us were in a\r\n     very great degree, if not indeed wholly, founded in the real truth\r\n     of what had happened. There is, I fear, no reason to doubt that\r\n     some of the very expressions I have mentioned have actually been\r\n     used, and that Lord F. has pledged himself too far to recede, with\r\n     respect to a total new system, both of men and measures. The first\r\n     point of this system goes to no less than the dismission of the\r\n     Chancellor, who was, as I understand, to be replaced by Adair. On\r\n     this subject, Pitt and myself cannot but feel that the only ground\r\n     on which the Ponsonbys can desire the Chancellor's removal, is the\r\n     conduct he held during the Regency in support of Lord Buckingham's\r\n     Government, and that our consent to such a step must therefore be\r\n     utterly dishonourable and degrading to us. But independent of this\r\n     consideration, it is my sincere opinion that there cannot be\r\n     adopted any measure more certainly destructive of the peace and\r\n     tranquillity of that country. The system of introducing English\r\n     party into Ireland, the principle of connecting changes of\r\n     Government here with the removal of persons high in office there,\r\n     and particularly the marking that system in the instance of a\r\n     person of Fitzgibbon's situation, weight, and character, are all so\r\n     utterly irreconcilable with every view that I have of the state of\r\n     that country, that I should really be inexcusable if I could make\r\n     myself a party to such a measure; and in this opinion Pitt entirely\r\n     concurs.\r\n\r\n     On every principle, therefore, of duty and character, we are\r\n     obliged to say that we cannot consent to this step, and we can only\r\n     regret that, if it was originally intended, so capital a feature in\r\n     the new arrangement was not brought forward earlier. The same\r\n     observation applies to the whole idea of holding out a new system\r\n     of men and measures in Ireland. If that was meant before the\r\n     junction was made, it ought surely to have been stated then, in\r\n     order that we might judge whether it did not oppose an\r\n     insurmountable bar to the whole scheme. If it has only been\r\n     conceived since that period, it ought certainly to have been\r\n     communicated and concerted here, before any pledge or assurance was\r\n     given to individuals who might be concerned in it there.\r\n\r\n     When I say this, you must not suppose that there enters into our\r\n     minds anything like warmth or resentment on the subject. The manner\r\n     in which everything else has been conducted since we acted\r\n     together, convinces me that the evil has arisen from precipitation\r\n     and indiscretion, and not from any concerted plan of committing us,\r\n     without our knowledge, to measures which we could not be supposed\r\n     willing to adopt. And if it were still possible that the thing\r\n     could be settled without discredit to either party, not only my\r\n     sense of the public interest, but my personal feeling towards them,\r\n     would make me think that no means ought to be left untried for that\r\n     purpose. I am, however, obliged to confess to myself that I see no\r\n     possibility of this. The publicity which has been given to the\r\n     whole business seems to render it utterly impracticable. The\r\n     assurances which have been given are well known, and the breach or\r\n     performance of them must be discreditable to one of the _two_\r\n     parties, for such, unfortunately, they now are again.\r\n\r\n     I never can enough regret your absence from this country while this\r\n     has been going on. I am sure if you had been here the whole thing\r\n     would have been avoided. As it is, what determination you will take\r\n     respecting your own line I know not, and I feel myself too deeply\r\n     interested in it to think myself a fair or competent adviser.\r\n\r\n     Nothing can be more unfortunate to the public interest than this\r\n     incident; but the sense of it would certainly be very much\r\n     aggravated to me if it were to lead, which I still hope it may not,\r\n     to the placing us two again on different lines, and in opposite\r\n     systems. Whatever you decide in that respect, I cannot help\r\n     flattering myself that you will do justice to our conduct; and\r\n     without calling upon you to condemn others, I cannot help\r\n     entertaining the belief that you will think no part of this great\r\n     misfortune imputable to us. With respect to my own personal\r\n     opinions of the importance of forming and maintaining the union,\r\n     you were, I am sure, enough a witness to them to make it very\r\n     unnecessary for me, in writing to you, to dwell much on that point.\r\n\r\n     I have written this to you, though the thing has not yet taken its\r\n     final turn, because any delay might possibly prevent your receiving\r\n     it before your arrival here, for which I now look with increased\r\n     impatience and anxiety.\r\n\r\n     God bless you, my dearest brother.\r\n\r\nThe weak point of the Government was its combination of opposite\r\nparties; and the consideration which finally determined the course of\r\nMinisters, was the necessity of preventing their differences from coming\r\nto an open rupture--a result that would have jeopardized the very\r\nexistence of the Administration. With that paramount object in view,\r\nLord Grenville, writing again to his brother, analyses the difficulties\r\nof the situation, and points out the only paths that could be opened to\r\nan honourable and creditable accommodation.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD GRENVILLE TO MR. THOMAS GRENVILLE.\r\n\r\n     Dover Street, Oct. 24th, 1794.\r\n     MY DEAREST BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     Since I wrote my last letter I have received yours, written the day\r\n     of your leaving Vienna, and I calculate that this will probably\r\n     find you at the Hague. Our situation, with respect to the point on\r\n     which I wrote to you so much at large, has been a little, and but a\r\n     little, improved by a conversation between the Duke of P. and Pitt.\r\n     Nothing having since passed, we conclude that there is a desire to\r\n     wait for the benefit of your opinion and Lord Spencer's upon this\r\n     difficult and distressing subject--a desire in which I need not say\r\n     we most heartily concur.\r\n\r\n     As far as anything can be concluded from a conversation which did\r\n     not lead to any decisive issue, I hope that we have been too easily\r\n     alarmed by Irish reports on the subject of a _new system_, and\r\n     that, probably in the imagination of those who have first given\r\n     rise to those reports, some loose and general expressions have been\r\n     construed into pointed and specific assurances. Be this however as\r\n     it may, it is certain that infinite mischief has already been done\r\n     by the prevalence of those reports, and both the settlement of the\r\n     points in discussion here, and the subsequent task of the future\r\n     Governor of Ireland, whoever he may be, have been rendered much\r\n     more difficult than they would have been if more reserve and\r\n     caution had been used. It is, however, useless to regret what is\r\n     past, and all our endeavours ought to be applied to remedy the\r\n     present evil. I most anxiously wait for the moment of talking over\r\n     with you the means of doing this, which I am confident every one\r\n     concerned joins in wishing, though all are obliged to confess the\r\n     difficulty of it.\r\n\r\n     Three points are to be considered--Has Lord F. still kept himself\r\n     sufficiently open with respect to his engagements with Grattan and\r\n     the Ponsonbys, as to be able to undertake the Irish Government with\r\n     honour and satisfaction to himself, without displacing the old\r\n     tenants of Government to make room for their opponents, and without\r\n     giving to the Ponsonbys in particular more influence and power than\r\n     belongs to their situation as one among several of the great\r\n     connexions in that country? If not, there seems no hope of any\r\n     permanent agreement on this subject, even if it were so patched up\r\n     for the present as that he could go to Ireland. The next is whether\r\n     it is possible for him to undertake the Government without\r\n     insisting on the removal of Fitzgibbon? If this cannot be done, the\r\n     thing must come to an immediate stop, as we are more and more\r\n     convinced that we cannot in honour or duty accede to that measure.\r\n     And lastly, supposing any or all of these considerations to oppose\r\n     an insurmountable obstacle in the way of his going, ought that to\r\n     prevent his continuing to hold his present situation? and can the\r\n     Duke of P., Lord F., and _others_, be justified in bringing on the\r\n     country the infinite mischiefs of the dissolution of the present\r\n     united Government, on no stronger ground than because alterations,\r\n     however desirable in their opinion, in the system of governing\r\n     Ireland cannot be adopted.\r\n\r\n     I have said nothing in all this of the question about Lord\r\n     Westmoreland's removal. I should readily agree with what you say in\r\n     your last letter on that subject, that he ought to wait for a\r\n     provision, if I did not see that even this is rendered more\r\n     difficult by the _eclat_ of what has happened. Still I should think\r\n     he ought to forego his claim; but if he thinks otherwise, he has a\r\n     positive promise, which of course cannot be broken. But I always\r\n     feel a confidence that this point would in some manner be arranged,\r\n     because I am sure that we should all be willing to make almost any\r\n     sacrifice rather than let it be said by the enemy, that after\r\n     having professed to unite on public principle, we had separated on\r\n     a mere squabble about the distribution of places.\r\n\r\n     The other points are those from which I fear the most. It is,\r\n     however, a satisfaction to me to think that I see on both sides (I\r\n     know it exists on one) a very sincere and earnest desire to prevent\r\n     the fatal consequences which a division amongst us, at such a\r\n     moment as the present, must infallibly produce. And I can truly add\r\n     that, on our part, this desire is increased by the manner in which\r\n     everything else had gone on before this unhappy subject was\r\n     started.\r\n\r\n     You are coming from a bad scene and to a bad scene; but we must\r\n     hope the best, both at home and abroad, and at least we ought all\r\n     to be quite sure that we can tell ourselves we have each done our\r\n     best to prevent the misfortunes which seem to hang over us.\r\n\r\n     God bless you, my dearest brother.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Dover Street, Oct. 30th, 1794.\r\n     MY DEAREST BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     I received your letter the day before yesterday at Dropmore. Mr.\r\n     Pitt, who had left me that morning, had shown me your letter to\r\n     him, with respect to which I say nothing, as I understood he meant\r\n     to write to you upon the subject. The whole business to which it\r\n     relates is in a situation, the final issue of which is extremely\r\n     doubtful. With my impression of the advantage, and even necessity,\r\n     of uniting at this time in the public service the great bulk of the\r\n     landed property of the country, and doing away all distinctions of\r\n     party between those who wish the maintenance of order and\r\n     tranquillity here, I shall very deeply regret, as a great public\r\n     misfortune, any event that leads to the dissolution of a system so\r\n     lately formed. But, on the other hand, I have certainly no\r\n     intention of making myself a party to any system of government in\r\n     Ireland that is incompatible with my views of the interest of this\r\n     country there. And in any case, I certainly neither have, nor can\r\n     take, as far as relates to myself, any step upon the subject which\r\n     has its origin in any other motive than a sense of public duty\r\n     under circumstances of much difficulty.\r\n\r\n     I considered the subject of my brother's acceptance of the\r\n     situation offered to him in Ireland as being, as in fact he appears\r\n     to have stated it to you, very undecided, even if any arrangement\r\n     were made for Lord Fitzwilliam's going there. I could have no\r\n     motive to keep it back from you, but felt it due to him to leave it\r\n     to him to do what I was sure he would be anxious to do. The whole\r\n     subject appears now in some degree suspended till his arrival. When\r\n     I see him I should of course state to him, as far as I am able to\r\n     do it, your ideas respecting it.\r\n\r\n     I am still of opinion that it will turn out that the alarm created\r\n     in Ireland, and the impression given here has originated in very\r\n     loose reports, magnified, as usual, by persons repeating them\r\n     according to their interest and wishes; but I state this as matter\r\n     of opinion only.\r\n\r\n     I expect my brother here every day. They left Vienna in the\r\n     beginning of this month, without having concluded any treaty,\r\n     though they seem to have established a juster sense of the present\r\n     crisis than prevailed before.\r\n\r\n     Our Prussian ally has had his payments stopped, and is withdrawing\r\n     his troops. In the meantime, the Empress of Russia has done his\r\n     business, or rather her own, in Poland, the Polish army being\r\n     completely defeated, and Kosciusko, who was the soul of the\r\n     enterprise, taken prisoner.\r\n\r\n     God bless you, my dearest brother.\r\n\r\n     Believe me ever most affectionately yours,\r\n     G.\r\n\r\nThe conduct of Lord Fitzwilliam had been reprehensible from the\r\nbeginning. The suggestion of the Lord-Lieutenancy had scarcely taken a\r\ndefinite shape, when he opened a communication, as appeared afterwards,\r\nwith the heads of the Irish party, and announced the system on which he\r\nintended to govern the country. In any case, such a proceeding would\r\nhave been inexpedient and indefensible, its inevitable effect being to\r\ncommit the policy of the Administration beforehand, to deprive it at\r\nonce of all dignity and independence, and to revive those heart-burnings\r\nand dissensions which had already so nearly endangered the connection of\r\nthe two kingdoms.\r\n\r\nBut, composed as the Cabinet was of men who were known to entertain\r\ndifferent opinions in reference to Ireland, the premature and\r\nunwarrantable publicity given by Lord Fitzwilliam to his own views was\r\ncalculated to precipitate still more injurious results. So far back as\r\nthe 23rd of August, he had written to Mr. Grattan, who was then\r\npersonally unknown to him, apprising him of his approaching appointment;\r\nand, in plain terms, calling in that gentleman and his party to his\r\nfuture councils. From the very first paragraph of his letter, it is\r\nevident that at the time when this ill-judged communication was made,\r\nthe arrangements respecting the Lord-Lieutenancy had not advanced\r\nsufficiently far to justify him in taking any ostensible step whatever\r\nin reference to Ireland. His own language was abundantly explicit on\r\nthis point: \"Though I have not as yet the honour of an appointment to\r\nsucceed Lord Westmoreland, there certainly is great probability of that\r\nevent taking place very soon.\" Yet in this early stage of the\r\nministerial negotiations, he did not hesitate to inform Mr. Grattan that\r\nhe intended to look to \"the system of the Duke of Portland, as the\r\nmodel,\" by which he should regulate his conduct; and that, in order to\r\nenable him to render that system effective, it was necessary he should\r\nbe supported by Mr. Grattan and his friends. \"It is, Sir, to you,\" he\r\nobserves, \"and your friends, the Ponsonbys, that I look for assistance\r\nin bringing it to bear,\" adding, \"it is that assistance which I am\r\ntherefore now soliciting.\" The letter concludes by inviting Mr. Grattan\r\nto form an \"intimate, direct, and avowed connection\" with the Castle,\r\nwhich he had never hitherto \"approached in confidence and avowed\r\nfriendship;\" and in the postscript he gives Mr. Grattan this significant\r\ncaution: \"It may seem a little inconsistent, and that this letter is\r\nwritten rather prematurely, when I beg not to be quoted as having\r\nannounced myself in the character of a Lord-Lieutenant elect; my\r\nnomination not having yet been mentioned to the King, on account of his\r\nabsence at Weymouth.\"[C]\r\n\r\nThis indiscreet and unjustifiable line of proceeding placed the\r\nMinistry in a dilemma, from which the escape, either way, was surrounded\r\nby dangers. They selected that alternative which appeared, under all\r\ncircumstances, to be the least hazardous; and on the 10th of December,\r\nLord Fitzwilliam attended the levee to kiss hands on his appointment.\r\n\r\nMr. Thomas Grenville, however, declined the office of Secretary, which\r\nwas conferred on Lord Milton.\r\n\r\n[Footnote C: This letter is published in full in the Life of Mr.\r\nGrattan.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1795.\r\n\r\nLORD FITZWILLIAM'S ADMINISTRATION IN IRELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe line of policy Lord Fitzwilliam intended to adopt was intimated at\r\nthe opening of the Parliament in January. Mr. Grattan moved the Address\r\nin answer to the Speech; a little later Mr. Conolly withdrew his\r\nopposition to the prorogation in deference to the wishes of Government;\r\nand the old supporters of the Administration were displaced by the\r\nPonsonbys and their connections. Remembering how all these men had acted\r\nin the Regency business, the obstructions they had thrown in the way of\r\nthe public service, and the vindictive opposition they had given to his\r\nmeasures, Lord Buckingham was deeply wounded by the apparent sanction\r\nextended to this complete change of system, which he regarded as a\r\ndisavowal of the course he had pursued in Ireland, and, in some sort, as\r\na personal indignity. In his communications with Lord Grenville he\r\nstated his feelings on this subject without reserve. He considered that\r\nin assenting to the appointment of Lord Fitzwilliam, after the damaging\r\ndisclosures that had taken place, the Cabinet had abandoned him to the\r\nobloquy of that party against whose inveterate hostility he had\r\nsuccessfully preserved the executive union of the two kingdoms; and this\r\nconsideration was embittered by the reflection that Lord Grenville, from\r\nhis position in the Ministry, had contributed influentially to place him\r\nin that humiliating light before the public. Lord Buckingham, with his\r\nacute sense of what was due to his own honour, looked at the question\r\nfrom that point alone; but Lord Grenville, in the discharge of his\r\nresponsibilities as a Cabinet Minister, was compelled to take a more\r\ncomprehensive view of it. Whether he decided rightly or wrongly, there\r\ncan be no doubt that he decided conscientiously, and that it was\r\nimpossible he could resolve upon any conclusion likely to be painful to\r\nLord Buckingham which his affection for him would not render equally\r\npainful to himself. But he felt at the same time that his duty demanded\r\nat his hands the sacrifice of his private feelings, and that this was a\r\ncase in which any hesitation upon such grounds would be attended by the\r\ngravest consequences to the Administration. It may be seen, also, from\r\nthe following letter, that he did not put the same construction upon\r\nthese transactions as that which was so sensitively urged by Lord\r\nBuckingham. His more practical mind discerned in the irresistible\r\nnecessity of the position a sufficient answer to all individual\r\nscruples; and maintaining, as he had stated in a former letter, that the\r\nsecurity and repose of Ireland depended, not upon this or that set of\r\nmen, which his observation of the character of the people and their\r\npolitics had led him to regard with comparative indifference, but upon\r\nthe soundness of the measures applied to her condition, he could not\r\nadmit that the decision which had been come to with respect to Lord\r\nFitzwilliam implied, even remotely, a disavowal of the line of conduct\r\nLord Buckingham had so successfully pursued under totally different\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Dover Street, Jan. 5th, 1795.\r\n     MY DEAR BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     As I keep no copies of my letters to you, and have neither time\r\n     enough, nor a mind sufficiently disengaged, to measure my\r\n     expressions, nor have ever accustomed myself to do so in writing to\r\n     you, all I can say on the subject of my last letter is, that if it\r\n     conveyed to you any impression different from that of the sincere\r\n     friendship and affection which dictated it, it very ill expressed\r\n     my feelings.\r\n\r\n     With respect to the rest, I can only say that, to the best of my\r\n     understanding, I have neither disavowed nor abandoned you, but\r\n     given a _very strong_ proof of my determination to do neither; that\r\n     I cannot believe that any such impression exists anywhere; that not\r\n     knowing the proofs of its existence, to which you refer, I can only\r\n     guess at them, and I therefore forbear to make upon them the\r\n     remarks to which, if my conjecture is right, they are so obviously\r\n     liable. But that I am at a loss even to guess at the meaning of\r\n     that part of your letter, which speaks of proofs laying before you\r\n     of some compact made on this subject above twelve months since, not\r\n     having, in my own mind, the smallest idea of the fact to which this\r\n     can refer.\r\n\r\n     Having never had any intention to disavow you, or to consent to any\r\n     system or measure to which I thought you could wish to object, it\r\n     was impossible for me to make to you any previous communication of\r\n     such intention.\r\n\r\n     The detail of all that passed respecting Lord Fitzwilliam's\r\n     appointment would be too long to go into now; and I have reason to\r\n     believe that you are not unacquainted with many of the\r\n     circumstances which would prove how very little idea there was of\r\n     concealment or mystery on my part respecting that subject. From the\r\n     first moment that you stated to me that you considered the idea of\r\n     giving to the Ponsonbys a share of office in Ireland as a measure\r\n     injurious to you, I explained to you my reasons for viewing it in a\r\n     different light. But I anxiously reconsidered the object in my own\r\n     mind, and I then acted, as I was bound to do, on my deliberate and\r\n     fixed opinion respecting a point which, in either view of it, was\r\n     of much too great public importance to make it possible for me to\r\n     decide it merely on the desire I must ever feel to consult your\r\n     wishes in preference to my own. Which of us is right in our view of\r\n     this question, it is not for me to say. The motives and grounds of\r\n     my opinion remain the same; and I see with regret that they do not\r\n     make on your mind the impression they have made on mine.\r\n\r\n     It would be a painful and invidious task to discuss the question\r\n     further; but I cannot receive from you a letter in which you tell\r\n     me that you feel you have lost my affection, without repeating to\r\n     you the assurance, which I still hope is not indifferent to you,\r\n     that this is not, in the smallest degree, the case. I have intended\r\n     to do nothing towards you but what should be the _most_ kind and\r\n     affectionate. I think I have so acted; but I am sure that I have so\r\n     meant to act. If any contrary impression produces in your mind any\r\n     feelings different from those which have made so great a part of my\r\n     happiness throughout life, I shall deeply regret what seems to be\r\n     annexed as a curse inseparable from the pursuit of a public life;\r\n     but I will once more beg you to be assured that neither those\r\n     feelings on your part, nor anything which they can produce, will\r\n     vary my sincere and heartfelt affection towards you, and that\r\n     whether my judgment has been right, as I still think it has, or\r\n     wrong, as you think it, my heart is, and shall be, uniformly and\r\n     invariably the same towards you.\r\n\r\n     It is with these sentiments that I shall ever be, my dearest\r\n     brother,\r\n\r\n     Most sincerely and affectionately yours,\r\n     GRENVILLE.\r\n\r\nLord Fitzwilliam had scarcely arrived in Ireland when he collected about\r\nhim the party with whom he had been in previous communication, and\r\ncommenced his new system by a series of dismissals of the former\r\nsupporters of Mr. Pitt's Government. Announcing his conviction that the\r\nimmediate concession of the Catholic claims was indispensable to the\r\ntranquillity and security of the country, he followed up his objects\r\nwith a vigour and expedition that created considerable alarm in England.\r\nThe Attorney-General was to be displaced, to make way for Mr. George\r\nPonsonby; the Solicitor-General was also to be removed, and Mr.\r\nBeresford, who was Purse-bearer to the Chancellor, and Mr. Cooke,\r\nSecretary at War, were to be dismissed. The dismissal of Mr. Beresford\r\nwas regarded as a measure of such extreme violence that it brought\r\nmatters to an issue between Lord Fitzwilliam and the Cabinet. Some\r\nletters at this time from Mr. Cooke to Lord Buckingham present a\r\nstriking _coup d'oeil_ of these affairs, as they appeared to one who was\r\ndeeply interested in their progress. Lord Fitzwilliam, it should be\r\nobserved, arrived in Ireland on the 5th of January, and the rapidity of\r\nhis official movements may be inferred from the date of the first of the\r\nfollowing letters, which was written only ten days afterwards.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. COOKE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Dublin Castle, Jan. 15th, 1795.\r\n     MY DEAR LORD,\r\n\r\n     As it was through your Lordship's kind and affectionate partiality\r\n     that I was placed in the War Office, I think it my duty to give you\r\n     the earliest information of my removal.\r\n\r\n     Since Lord Fitzwilliam's arrival, I have merely seen his Excellency\r\n     at levee. With his chief secretary, Lord Milton, I have daily\r\n     transacted official business, without a syllable passing of a\r\n     nature in any degree confidential. The removal of Mr. Beresford, of\r\n     the Attorney and Solicitor-General, had created alarms; but there\r\n     were assurances from an English quarter that Mr. Hamilton and I\r\n     were not to be meddled with.\r\n\r\n     The reverse has taken place. About four o'clock to-day, Lord Milton\r\n     conveyed to Mr. Hamilton his Excellency's pleasure that he should\r\n     retire from office, with a desire that Mr. Hamilton should state\r\n     his situation after removal, as it was his Excellency's intention\r\n     to make him a provision.\r\n\r\n     About half an hour after, Lord Milton sent for me, and delivered a\r\n     similar message; stating, upon conversation, that his Excellency\r\n     did not in any degree mean to reflect upon my conduct, but that my\r\n     retirement was necessary for his arrangements, and that he was\r\n     disposed to make me a fair provision; at the same time, upon\r\n     conversation, his Lordship intimated that it was possible his\r\n     Excellency might differ as to the provision which I might expect\r\n     and he might think reasonable.\r\n\r\n     I have thought it my duty to submit these particulars to your\r\n     Lordship. From your Lordship I received my office; the Government\r\n     with which you have been connected I have supported to my utmost;\r\n     and I have the happiness to feel assured that I shall ever retain\r\n     your Lordship's kindness and regards till I cease to deserve it.\r\n\r\n     Believe me, my dear Lord, with the utmost respect,\r\n     Ever your most devoted and humble servant,\r\n     E. COOKE.\r\n\r\n     The Most Noble the Marquis of Buckingham, &c. &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. COOKE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     (Most Private.)       Dublin, Sackville Street, Feb. 7th, 1795.\r\n     MY LORD,\r\n\r\n     I am to thank your Lordship for your most friendly and flattering\r\n     letter; and as you seem curious to know the feelings of myself and\r\n     colleagues on our removals, as well as the nature of our\r\n     compensations, I will endeavour to detail them as well as I can.\r\n\r\n     With respect to Mr. Wolf, the first act was to claim the reversion\r\n     recommended for him by Lord Westmoreland, and promised above a year\r\n     ago by Mr. Pitt, and which the King had actually signed, as a\r\n     measure for negotiation. Wolf _in vain_ argued that the reversion\r\n     was not a subject for negotiation. They offered him a Peerage for\r\n     his wife, and a Chief Judge's place. Wolf, in addition, asked\r\n     precedency at the Bar. After some days, the precedency was refused,\r\n     and the promise of a Chief Judge's place was retracted. Wolf\r\n     insisted on the promise. He was threatened that if he insisted, he\r\n     should be superseded. He did insist, and the promise was at length\r\n     renewed, in case a vacancy should happen.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Wolf gains nothing but the Peerage for his wife, for the\r\n     reversion was actually his own, and had been signed by the King;\r\n     the promise of a Chief Justiceship is very precarious, and he is\r\n     degraded in his profession.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Toler, having in his pocket the promise of succeeding to the\r\n     Attorney-Generalship, is to be superseded for Mr. Curran. He has\r\n     asked for a Peerage to his wife, and for the succession to Lord\r\n     Carleton. Upon his first demand, nothing has been said to him; upon\r\n     his second, it has been intimated that he may _look_ for any seat\r\n     on the Bench short of Chief Justiceship. Your Lordship must guess\r\n     that Mr. Toler feels himself _gratified_, especially when he\r\n     recollects that, after having boldly and manfully, at the risk of\r\n     his person, set himself against all the seditious and levellers in\r\n     and out of the House, he is sacrificed to make way for Mr. Curran,\r\n     who has been the most seditious incendiary in Ireland ever since he\r\n     became a public character.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Beresford your Lordship may have probably seen. He, it seems,\r\n     was dismissed because he was king of Ireland, as Bowes Daly\r\n     authoritatively informed him in his Excellency's name. The object\r\n     with respect to him was to publicly degrade him, give him a\r\n     provision during pleasure, then attack him, and have a pretext to\r\n     ruin him, if he should defend himself with spirit. He has been\r\n     acquainted that, in pursuance of a resolution of the House of\r\n     Commons, he is to have his salary of L2000 a-year on Excise\r\n     Incidents--not for his services, but his long and laborious\r\n     _attendance_. The attempt has been to stigmatize him, to degrade\r\n     him, and to make him dependent. I hope the last will not be the\r\n     case--the two former cannot.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Hamilton had merely fifty years of the most laborious and\r\n     faithful service to plead, under all Administrations, whether\r\n     adverse to each other or combined. He loses L1200 a-year by\r\n     removal; he loses the comforts of settlement, he loses the prospect\r\n     of providing for his sons; he is, however, informed that something\r\n     will be done for one of them!\r\n\r\n     I am equally removed from a station of much advantage and\r\n     opportunity. If I do not resort to my bargain with Thornton, I lose\r\n     L1800 a-year; if I do, I lose L1300 a-year. I am told that I am not\r\n     to expect compensation for my losses, but that his Excellency, on\r\n     review of my situation, will make compensation for my services.\r\n     As, however, Lord Milton was pleased to state to me that his\r\n     Excellency did not mean to cast in any degree any imputation on my\r\n     conduct, and that he removed me merely on the principle of\r\n     _accommodation_, and to make room for arrangements which he thought\r\n     necessary for his Government, I thought it my duty to claim\r\n     compensation, not for my services, but for my losses, and to throw\r\n     myself upon his Excellency's justice and honour.\r\n\r\n     I have heard that my having ventured not to appear satisfied in my\r\n     dismissal, has given offence; and it has been intimated, though not\r\n     from authority, that there is not an intention to compensate me at\r\n     all, but merely to indemnify Thornton for what, by agreement, he is\r\n     in honour obliged to pay me.\r\n\r\n     When Lord Fitzwilliam seized upon the Provostship and the\r\n     Secretaryship of State, the patronage of which absolutely belonged\r\n     to Lord Westmoreland, his Lordship was obliged to forced measures,\r\n     in order to extricate himself from specific promises; he therefore,\r\n     on this principle, included Lord Glentworth in Sir L. O'Brien's\r\n     patent of Clerk of the Hanaper. Sir L. lately died. Lord Glentworth\r\n     felt the luckiest of men; in a few days, Lord Fitzwilliam sent for\r\n     him, and acquainted him that he could not suffer him to remain in\r\n     that office; that, however, he had a high respect for him; that he\r\n     had been particularly recommended to him by Mr. Pitt, and that he\r\n     should hope to do something for him. The Duke of Leinster, being\r\n     very hungry, has swallowed the office.\r\n\r\n     With regard to coalition here, or the slightest appearances of it,\r\n     there are none. Parnell is the only old servant of the Crown who is\r\n     at all consulted, and he only so far as concerns his situation. The\r\n     whole is very strange. The Ponsonbys are all-powerful, and appear\r\n     to direct everything. I know not at all what measures are intended,\r\n     or whether an opposition will start up; but the giving up all the\r\n     powers of the State to one family does not please.\r\n\r\n     The idea of removing all the remaining restraints from the\r\n     Catholics is not relished; the worst is, that an appeal has been\r\n     made to the Catholic democracy, and I know they are not to be\r\n     depended upon; they look to the abolition of tythes and a reform of\r\n     Parliament on numerical principles. Ever since the first movements\r\n     of the Roman Catholic Committee, the lower classes have been in a\r\n     state of fermentation, and they continue their disorders and\r\n     insurrections.\r\n\r\n     I write this _confidentially_, and beg your Lordship to accept my\r\n     best acknowledgments for your kind sentiments.\r\n\r\n     Ever most respectfully, your Lordship's most faithful and obedient\r\n     servant,\r\n\r\n     E. COOKE.\r\n\r\nThe result of Lord Fitzwilliam's vigorous attempts to force upon the\r\nCabinet a line of policy which reason and justice alike rejected, is\r\nwell known. A Cabinet Council was called on the 19th of March, for the\r\npurpose of taking the whole subject into consideration, when it was\r\nunanimously resolved to recal Lord Fitzwilliam \"as a measure necessary\r\nfor the preservation of the empire.\" The most remarkable incident\r\nconnected with this proceeding was the fact that the Duke of Portland,\r\nupon whose \"system\" Lord Fitzwilliam had based his operations, and who\r\nwas supposed, all throughout, to have supported him in them, was present\r\nat this meeting of the Cabinet, and concurred in its decision.\r\n\r\nBut Lord Fitzwilliam had not done with Ireland yet. On his return to\r\nEngland, he brought the subject before the House of Lords and demanded\r\nan inquiry, which was refused. On this occasion some letters which had\r\nbeen addressed by him to Lord Carlisle were published, and in one of\r\nthem \"imputed malversations\" were attributed to Mr. Beresford. In\r\nconsequence of this statement, Mr. Beresford addressed the following\r\nletter to his Lordship:\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. BERESFORD TO THE EARL FITZWILLIAM.\r\n\r\n     No. 11, Beaumont Street, June 22nd, 1795.\r\n     MY LORD,\r\n\r\n     Your Lordship must have seen two letters to the Earl of Carlisle,\r\n     which have been published in your name, and in general circulation.\r\n     I have for a long time hoped, that they would be disavowed or\r\n     explained by your Lordship; I was unwilling to suppose that such a\r\n     publication had ever been sanctioned by you; I could not bring\r\n     myself to believe, that your Lordship, possessing the feelings of a\r\n     man, and the honour of a gentleman, could avail yourself of the\r\n     power and the trust which had been committed to you by His Majesty,\r\n     wantonly to traduce a private character, by insinuations expressed\r\n     in terms so vague and unqualified, as to make it impossible\r\n     publicly to refute them. From the rank which you hold in society, I\r\n     must presume, if you thought it your duty to impeach my conduct as\r\n     a servant of the Crown, you would have adopted the fair and manly\r\n     course of advancing direct and specific charges against me, which\r\n     must have led to my conviction, if they had been founded. Direct\r\n     and specific charges I could fairly have met and refuted; but\r\n     crooked and undefined insinuations against private character,\r\n     through the pretext of official discussion, your Lordship must\r\n     allow are the weapons of a libeller.\r\n\r\n     The publication in question, states that you recommended my removal\r\n     from office, \"because I was a person under universal heavy\r\n     suspicions, subject to the opprobrium and unpopularity attendant on\r\n     maladministration and much imputed malversation.\" The aspersions\r\n     contained in this paragraph, are so utterly ungrounded, so\r\n     unprovoked, unmanly, illiberal, and false, that I could not believe\r\n     your Lordship could have meant to apply them to a gentleman, by\r\n     birth your equal, and I will tell you, of reputation as unsullied\r\n     as your own at any period of your life; there is no charge, however\r\n     monstrous, of which the idea is not here conveyed; and yet there is\r\n     none to which the paragraph points directly, so as to afford an\r\n     opportunity for vindication.\r\n\r\n     Your Lordship will, I trust, feel the justness of the warmth with\r\n     which I express myself on those aspersions of my character; and\r\n     that when I give the lie to such aspersions, I give it upon\r\n     reasonings as essential to your honour, as they are to mine; and if\r\n     anything were wanting to induce me to believe that your Lordship\r\n     will concur with me in this opinion, I should be satisfied of it,\r\n     from the communications which were made to me by persons authorized\r\n     to convey your Lordship's sentiments upon my projected removal from\r\n     the Board of Revenue, and from the official communication made to\r\n     me by Lord Milton on the same subject.\r\n\r\n     Considerations of domestic calamity might sufficiently explain the\r\n     silence I have hitherto observed; but in other respects I should\r\n     have been unwilling perhaps to have addressed you sooner. I would\r\n     not appear to avoid any inquiry into my conduct, which insinuations\r\n     originating from such high authority might be expected to provoke;\r\n     it became me, therefore, to await with patience the result of the\r\n     discussions respecting Irish affairs which were taking place in\r\n     both Parliaments, and even until the close of the session had shown\r\n     that it was not your Lordship's intention, nor that of either\r\n     House, to take any further step in the business. I cannot now\r\n     repent of my own forbearance, as it served, at least, to bring\r\n     forward testimonies most highly honourable to me, from many\r\n     individuals of the first weight and character in the age in which\r\n     we live; these testimonies having been so repeatedly and so\r\n     publicly urged in your Lordship's presence, and without\r\n     contradiction on your part, cannot but have convinced you, that you\r\n     had formed a wrong judgment respecting me, or that you had been\r\n     deceived by others; in either case, I am entitled to hope and to\r\n     presume that you will render to me, and to my character, that\r\n     justice which one man of honour has a right to expect from another.\r\n\r\n     I have the honour to be,\r\n     Your most obedient and humble servant,\r\n     BERESFORD.\r\n\r\n     Earl Fitzwilliam.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo this letter Lord Fitzwilliam transmitted the following reply:\r\n\r\n\r\nEARL FITZWILLIAM TO MR. BERESFORD.\r\n\r\n     Milton, June 23rd, 1795.\r\n     SIR,\r\n\r\n     I had the honour of receiving your letter of the 22nd this morning.\r\n     The letters you allude to, were written by me to Lord Carlisle; and\r\n     those printed, though not printed by my direction, at my desire, or\r\n     with my privity, I believe to be substantially copies of the\r\n     letters I sent to Lord Carlisle; and certainly are so with respect\r\n     to the quotation in your letter to me, which, therefore, I cannot\r\n     permit any person whatever to charge with falsity.\r\n\r\n     It is difficult for me to leave this place abruptly (domestic\r\n     considerations require a little management); but I will be in\r\n     London in the course of a few days, where I trust I may rely upon\r\n     your remaining for the present.\r\n\r\n     I have the honour to be, Sir,\r\n     Your most obedient and very humble servant,\r\n     WENTWORTH FITZWILLIAM.\r\n\r\n     Rt. Hon. John Beresford.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn consequence of this letter Mr. Beresford sent his friend Mr.\r\nMontgomery to Lord Fitzwilliam, who refused to enter into any\r\nexplanation. The usual arrangements were then made for a hostile\r\nmeeting, Lord Townshend acting as the second of Mr. Beresford, and Lord\r\nMoira attending Lord Fitzwilliam. When the parties met upon the ground,\r\nhowever, at Kensington, the duel was prevented by the interference of a\r\npeace officer.\r\n\r\nThe correspondence of Lord Grenville with Lord Buckingham appears to\r\nhave been suspended during the greater part of the year, but it was\r\nresumed towards its close. By this time the allies were gradually\r\nretrieving their losses.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Pall Mall, Nov. 12th, 1795.\r\n     MY DEAREST BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     You will receive by this post the \"Gazette,\" with the account of\r\n     the late successes of the Austrians. These accounts came in\r\n     yesterday at so many detached periods, and that circumstance, with\r\n     others, occupied every moment so completely, as to make it really\r\n     impossible for me to send you any detail of them by the post. I\r\n     enclose for your better understanding the \"Gazette,\" a Prussian map\r\n     of the siege of Mentz, when the French occupied it. The position of\r\n     the French in this business has been very nearly the same with that\r\n     of the allies, as marked in this plan.\r\n\r\n     Craufurd's account of the successes is certainly understated, but\r\n     particularly in what relates to the loss of the French; because,\r\n     besides the killed and wounded--the number of which all the private\r\n     accounts state to have been exceedingly great (as it must be in\r\n     that precipitate retreat)--the enemy have lost very great numbers\r\n     by desertion.\r\n\r\n     No doubt is entertained of our having Manheim very soon. I am not\r\n     sanguine enough to hope that Pichegru will stay to be surrounded by\r\n     Clerfage, who is marching up the left bank of the Rhine, or that he\r\n     will suffer the latter to force him to a battle, which he may so\r\n     easily avoid by retreating towards his own frontier, now covered by\r\n     Landau, Luxembourg and Tours, &c., &c. The disappointment of the\r\n     French projects, and the destruction of so great a part of the army\r\n     which had been employed in them, are therefore, I fear, the chief\r\n     advantages we shall reap from these successes, except in what\r\n     relates to the impression produced here and on the continent, the\r\n     effect of which is almost beyond calculation.\r\n\r\n     Our Bills are going triumphantly through the two Houses. The\r\n     general impression of the House of Commons was, I understand, as\r\n     favourable as it could possibly be, and you need not be told what\r\n     the feelings of the House of Lords are on this subject. We shall\r\n     not have Pitt's Bill up till after the call. If you should not then\r\n     be in town, I should much wish you to send your proxy; and if you\r\n     have no objection to do so, and had rather put it in my hands than\r\n     any other, I will disengage myself in the interim from one of those\r\n     I now hold.\r\n\r\n     What have you done about our meeting? Shall I attend it or not? Let\r\n     me know which you wish, and I will do accordingly.\r\n\r\n     Ever most affectionately yours,\r\n     G.\r\n\r\n     I should be much obliged to you to return my map when you have done\r\n     with it, as I keep all these _historical_ maps that fall in my way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1796.\r\n\r\nTHE PROSECUTION OF THE WAR SUSTAINED BY REPEATED MAJORITIES IN\r\nPARLIAMENT--MR. BURKE'S SCHOOL FOR THE EDUCATION OF EMIGRANT\r\nCHILDREN--BUONAPARTE APPOINTED TO THE COMMAND IN ITALY--LORD\r\nMALMESBURY'S MISSION TO PARIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe motion for negotiations with France had been again brought forward\r\ntowards the close of the last session of Parliament, and was again\r\nnegatived. Mr. Pitt still insisted upon the impossibility of France\r\nbeing enabled to prosecute the war, with her finances in a state of\r\nruin, and seven hundred and twenty millions of assignats in circulation.\r\nGreat changes had undoubtedly taken place. The National Assembly had\r\nbeen dissolved, and a regular form of Government established in its\r\nplace; and although at that time Mr. Pitt rejected the idea of proposing\r\nany terms of peace to the Republic, he admitted without hesitation that\r\nif the new Government were put into activity with the acquiescence of\r\nthe nation, so as that the voice of the people could be heard through\r\ntheir representatives, all obstacles and objections to negotiation would\r\nbe removed. Thus the question stood at the close of the year 1795.\r\n\r\nThe subject was renewed at the opening of the session in 1796, with the\r\nsame result. Mr. Pitt resolved it at once into a question of confidence\r\nin Ministers. If the House thought that confidence could not be safely\r\nvested in them, the proper course was to address His Majesty to remove\r\nthem. He still maintained that the French had exhausted their means of\r\ncarrying on the war; and that, with respect to negotiations for peace,\r\nthe point to be considered was the probability of obtaining just and\r\nhonourable terms, which, it was evident from their public declarations,\r\nthe French were not disposed to admit. The confidence of Parliament in\r\nthe wisdom and discretion of Ministers was unequivocally testified in\r\nthe large majority by which the motion was rejected.\r\n\r\nFailing to attain their object in this direct form, the Opposition\r\nresorted to other means of harassing the Administration. In a motion on\r\nthe state of the nation, Mr. Grey entered into an examination of the\r\nfinancial condition of the country, exposing the enormous expenditure\r\nand heavy taxation entailed by the war, at a time when a more discreet\r\npatriotism would have avoided such details. He showed that during the\r\nthree preceding years seventy-seven millions had been added to the\r\nfunded debt, and that, in addition to the parliamentary grants, upwards\r\nof thirty-one millions had been expended without the consent of\r\nParliament. Notwithstanding these disclosures, however, Mr. Pitt\r\nproposed a second loan of seven millions and a half for the prosecution\r\nof the war, which the House immediately acceded to.\r\n\r\nIn both Houses, the efforts of the Opposition to overthrow the\r\nAdministration were followed up with indefatigable activity in the shape\r\nof condemnatory resolutions and motions of addresses to the Throne; and\r\nin all instances they were defeated by overwhelming majorities. The\r\nsession terminated in the middle of May, when Parliament was dissolved\r\nby proclamation, His Majesty thanking both Houses emphatically for the\r\nuniform wisdom, temper, and firmness by which their proceedings had been\r\ncharacterised.\r\n\r\nThe destitute condition of the French emigrants who sought an asylum in\r\nEngland on the breaking out of the Revolution, and whose numbers were\r\ncontinually increasing, excited universal commiseration. The attention\r\nof Government was earnestly directed to the means of providing for them,\r\nand measures were adopted for giving the utmost efficacy to the public\r\nsympathy. Amongst the persons who interested themselves actively on\r\ntheir behalf were the Marquis of Buckingham and Mr. Burke. The object to\r\nwhich they mainly addressed their exertions was the education of\r\nemigrant children whose fathers had perished in the convulsions of their\r\ncountry, or who were unable to obtain instruction for them. The forlorn\r\nsituation of these friendless children, in a country with whose language\r\nthey were unacquainted, had attracted the notice of Mr. Burke, with whom\r\nthe project originated, and who applied to Government in the first\r\ninstance for assistance to enable him to carry out his charitable\r\ndesign. The appeal was liberally responded to. A house was taken and\r\nfitted up for the purpose in Buckinghamshire, at Penn, near\r\nBeaconsfield, the residence of Mr. Burke; and, by an order of the\r\nTreasury, the Duke of Portland, the Lord Chancellor, the Marquis of\r\nBuckingham, Mr. Burke, and others were appointed trustees for the\r\nmanagement of the school, which had been established in the first\r\ninstance by Mr. Burke at his own expense. The following interesting\r\nletter from Mr. Burke contains some particulars concerning this\r\ninstitution, which had just been opened. The \"clean and not unpleasing\"\r\ncostume spoken of by the writer consisted of a blue uniform which he had\r\nassigned to the boys, with a white cockade bearing the inscription of\r\n\"Vive le Roi.\" Those boys who had lost their fathers were distinguished\r\nby a bloody label, and the loss of uncles was marked in a similar manner\r\nby a black one. At this time Mr. Burke had the sole management of the\r\nschool, and watched over its progress with unabated solicitude to the\r\nend of his life. The Commission nominated by the Government had not, it\r\nappears, been communicated to him, and he justly complains to his\r\ncorrespondent of the embarrassing position in which the oversight, or\r\nneglect, had placed him. The Marquis of Buckingham took a warm interest\r\nin the education and welfare of the boys, and, as a means of fostering a\r\nmartial and loyal spirit amongst them, made them a present of a pair of\r\ncolours and a brass cannon, which were exhibited with great pride and\r\nexultation on all public occasions.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. BURKE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     May 24th, 1796.\r\n     MY DEAR LORD,\r\n\r\n     Having received no answer to my last letter, I persuade myself\r\n     there was nothing in it to displease you; otherwise your general\r\n     politeness and your kind partiality to me would have led you to\r\n     give me such instructions as might prevent me from falling into\r\n     errors in the delicate business in which, under your countenance\r\n     and with your approbation, I have engaged myself.\r\n\r\n     We look forward with a pleasure, mixed with some degree of\r\n     impatience, to the visit which your Lordship and Lady Buckingham\r\n     have flattered us with the hope of, though I am afraid the heat of\r\n     the general election will be over before we can enjoy that\r\n     satisfaction.\r\n\r\n     I think, however unfortunate I may find myself in all my attempts\r\n     to please the Bishop of Leon, that your Lordship and Lady\r\n     Buckingham will feel the same pleasing and affecting interest in\r\n     what is done here, that all have been touched with who see what is\r\n     going on. You will be pleased with the celerity, if not with the\r\n     perfection, of our work. Five-and-forty beds are ready; the rest\r\n     will be so in a very few days. An old bad stable is converted into\r\n     an excellent school-room. The chapel is decent, in place and in\r\n     furniture. The eating-room is reasonably good. Twenty-five boys are\r\n     received, clad in a cleanly and not unpleasing manner, and they are\r\n     fed in an orderly way, with a wholesome and abundant diet. The\r\n     masters are pleased with their pupils; the pupils are pleased with\r\n     their preceptors; and I am sure I have reason to be pleased with\r\n     them all. I see them almost every day, and at almost all hours; as\r\n     well at their play as at their studies and exercise. I have never\r\n     seen finer boys, or more fit for the plan of education I mean to\r\n     follow for them, as long as it pleases the Government to continue\r\n     that charge in my hands. I am responsible, that if they are left to\r\n     me for six months, a set of finer lads, for their age and standing,\r\n     will not be seen in Europe.\r\n\r\n     The only unfortunate part of the business is, that some of them\r\n     speak not a word of English, and they who are the most forward in\r\n     it are very imperfect. There is but one of the masters who can be\r\n     said to know anything of it, and he is far indeed from the ability\r\n     to teach it. There must be a person who, besides going with them\r\n     through all their Latin readings and construing them into English,\r\n     will daily converse with them, and ground them in the principles\r\n     and the utterance of that tongue which belongs to the nation which\r\n     alone promises them an asylum upon earth. For many reasons, I\r\n     should prefer a clergyman of their own persuasion, and of our\r\n     country. But though I have always known that their number was\r\n     small, I did not conceive it to be so inconsiderable as I now find\r\n     it. But some English subject must be found to be about these boys\r\n     at all hours. It would be a terrible thing to condemn these poor\r\n     creatures to an universal exile, and to be perpetual vagrants,\r\n     without a possibility of being in a state of effectual\r\n     communication with the natives of any country or incorporating\r\n     themselves with any people. God forbid that, under the pretext of a\r\n     benefit, I should be the cause of their utter ruin.\r\n\r\n     The Bishop of Leon has written me a letter which, in my present\r\n     state of health (by no means the best), gives me a good deal of\r\n     uneasiness. Hitherto, I have received the boys without any inquiry,\r\n     as they were successively sent to me by the worthy prelate;\r\n     considering them as the objects of his selection amongst the\r\n     candidates for this situation. To my astonishment, in a letter\r\n     which I received from him last Saturday he tells me that all the\r\n     vacancies are filled: but that he has had nothing in the world to\r\n     do with the matter, and that he is no more than a simple clerk.\r\n     Your Lordship will see by the letters that I have the honour to\r\n     enclose for your perusal, that after filling up all the places, the\r\n     pleasure of rejecting the rest of the candidates is reserved for\r\n     me. He has contrived matters so, that others have all the grace of\r\n     obliging, and all the pleasure of being useful; and that all which\r\n     is harsh and odious is thrown upon me, as a reward for all the\r\n     trouble and expense I have been at in this business. On this I\r\n     shall make no further remark.\r\n\r\n     By the letters, your Lordship will see that the Bishop of Leon\r\n     tells the applicants, that the selection is to be made by certain\r\n     Lords Commissioners. I never have been apprised by the Bishop of\r\n     the existence of any Commission, or of any Commissioners for the\r\n     purpose of a choice. If such a thing at all exists, I should have\r\n     flattered myself that I should have been apprised of it; of their\r\n     rules, of its proceedings, and of the times of its sitting. I\r\n     believe I am the very first person who, having had the honour of\r\n     proposing a plan to Government, and being permitted to have the\r\n     management of it, have been kept wholly out of the secret of the\r\n     appointment of its objects. The name of every boy sent to me was\r\n     unknown to me to the moment of his arrival; the names of those who\r\n     are to come are equally unknown. Not one circumstance relative to\r\n     any of them is come to my knowledge. The poorest country\r\n     schoolmaster would have been favoured with some better account of\r\n     his pupils.\r\n\r\n     I must beg leave to remark to your Lordship, that the account given\r\n     by the Bishop of Leon to the applicants is wholly different from\r\n     that which he gives to me. In his two last letters to me (one, and\r\n     the most explicit, of which I received just now) he tells me that\r\n     the selection and nomination is not in any Commissioners, but\r\n     solely in your Lordship, and that he is no more than a clerk. If I\r\n     had not received it from so good an authority, I could hardly have\r\n     believed that your Lordship, upon a mere abstract of petitions,\r\n     without further examination, or any consultation, even with the\r\n     Bishop of Leon, should have decided upon sixty out of perhaps\r\n     fourscore applications. But, as I am sure you always act with\r\n     equity and discretion, I am perfectly satisfied in your having\r\n     assumed this very delicate and critical of all trusts. I only wish\r\n     that I had been apprised of your Lordship's having taken on you\r\n     that office, as, though I should not have ventured to recommend a\r\n     single person, I really think I might, with all humility, have made\r\n     some useful suggestions, which your desire of all matters being\r\n     before you, that might guide you to a sure decision, would make you\r\n     willing to receive, even from a person so very inconsiderable as I\r\n     am in every point of view.\r\n\r\n     I am sure your Lordship wishes that, in the very reprehensible\r\n     situation in which I stand, I may be able to give some sort of\r\n     account of my trust; and when I have engaged with Government for\r\n     the education of sixty boys, I ought to know at whose hands, on\r\n     what authority, and on whose recommendation I receive them.\r\n     Certainly they are not recommended or chosen by me; and when I go\r\n     to the Treasury, and tell the Minister who issues the money to me\r\n     (whenever it shall be issued) that I have employed it in the\r\n     maintenance and the education of those whom I do not myself know,\r\n     nor can tell in any regular and authorised manner from whom I\r\n     received them, I should make a very despicable, not to say a\r\n     criminal figure. I cannot take your Lordship's pleasure from the\r\n     Bishop of Leon; though he tells me he is (not your Lordship's\r\n     friend and adviser) but your clerk, as you have never informed me\r\n     of this his relation to you. I therefore, for my voucher and\r\n     justification, request that you will be pleased (the Committee and\r\n     the Bishop absolutely disclaiming all choice) to send me a list of\r\n     the names, circumstances and description of the boys whom you send\r\n     to me, or have sent, together with a certificate, that having duly\r\n     examined into the several claims and pretensions of the candidates,\r\n     you have found these the best entitled.\r\n\r\n     When I have received this attestation as my authority and voucher,\r\n     far from cavilling at either the person naming, or the names, I\r\n     shall receive them most cheerfully; happy that your Lordship\r\n     having generously and nobly taken to yourself the election, these\r\n     objects have obtained security for a powerful protection, to place\r\n     them, as successively they shall be qualified, in some way useful\r\n     to themselves and to the public. I shall take care that they do no\r\n     dishonour to your patronage; at least to the moment in which\r\n     (having received them from your hands) I deliver them back into the\r\n     same benevolent and protecting safeguard.\r\n\r\n     My dear Lord, have the goodness to excuse the length of this\r\n     letter, on account of the weight of my responsibility and the very\r\n     difficult situation in which I stand.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. Burke begs leave to join me in the most truly respectful\r\n     compliments to Lady Buckingham, and if we may be permitted, on very\r\n     little acquaintance, to Lord and Lady Temple. No persons can more\r\n     sincerely wish, than we do, all kind of honour and happiness to you\r\n     and all that belong to you.\r\n\r\n     I have the honour to be, with the most perfect respect and\r\n     affection,\r\n\r\n     My dear Lord,\r\n     Your Lordship's most obedient and faithful humble servant,\r\n     EDM. BURKE.\r\n\r\nThe name of Buonaparte appears for the first time in this Correspondence\r\nin the month of August. Supported by the patronage of Barras, whose\r\nconfidence in his talents and activity were so conspicuously justified\r\nby the results, he had recently been appointed to the command of the\r\narmy of Italy, now augmented by large reinforcements. He was at this\r\nperiod only twenty-six years of age, and had never seen a regular\r\nengagement; but his genius inspired the highest hopes, and his\r\nextraordinary success gave a completely new aspect to the war.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Dropmore, Aug. 14th, 1796.\r\n     MY DEAREST BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     I was extremely sorry to hear so indifferent an account of your\r\n     health, but I hope the worst of the attack is now over. I return\r\n     you the letter from this unfortunate King, whose restoration to the\r\n     throne of his ancestors is now, at least, as remote as that of\r\n     Charles II. ever was--I fear, indeed, a great deal more so. I have\r\n     heard no more particulars of the attempt to assassinate him, than\r\n     the account which the Duke de Harcourt showed me, and which was the\r\n     same which they afterwards put into the newspapers.\r\n\r\n     The Prince of Hohenlohe's language has always had a leaning to the\r\n     side of Austria and England; but long experience has satisfied me\r\n     that, from a Prussian General, language of this sort means no more\r\n     than to describe to which party in the Berlin politics he may\r\n     happen to be inclined. We have, however, now made a last effort to\r\n     ascertain this point, but with very little expectation of success.\r\n\r\n     I do not wonder that the Navy should wish for a Spanish war, nor\r\n     that they should be the only set of men in England who do so. I\r\n     trust it may still be avoided, though the result is certainly very\r\n     doubtful when treating with such a Court. The distribution of our\r\n     limited number of sailors, into ships of the line and frigate\r\n     force, is a very nice and delicate question; but as far as I can\r\n     flatter myself that I understand it--which is not very much--I have\r\n     always inclined more to the latter, and I think the experience of\r\n     this war is in favour of that opinion. The same circumstances would\r\n     surely operate still more strongly in the case of a war with Spain,\r\n     whose commerce offers more _prise_ than that of France, and whose\r\n     line-of-battle force, even separately--and still more if united\r\n     with French ships--can never be put in competition with ours, ship\r\n     for ship, or anything approaching to it.\r\n\r\n     There is an account of a successful _sortie_ from Mantua, in which\r\n     the French have lost fifteen hundred men; but I do not yet know the\r\n     particulars, the despatches being gone to Weymouth. The Archduke is\r\n     at Donawert, or at least looking to that position, which is a\r\n     strong one, if his army was not dispirited. The reinforcement sent\r\n     to Italy has hitherto operated very fatally upon the campaign. It\r\n     remains to be seen what effect it will produce against Buonaparte's\r\n     army. But it is evidently too late to prevent the plunder of\r\n     Italy--the great object of that expedition.\r\n\r\n     Ever, my dear brother,\r\n     Most truly and affectionately yours,\r\n     G.\r\n\r\n     Pray let me remind you of the sheep; though just now my pastures\r\n     look rather brown, and will, I fear, give them a bad impression of\r\n     the fare which they will have.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Sept. 24th, 1796.\r\n     MY DEAREST BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     We have again a report, which seems worthy of credit, of an action\r\n     at Montauban, on the 14th, previous to Jourdan's crossing the\r\n     Rhine, at Neuwied, in which he was totally defeated, and lost all\r\n     his cannon, &c. This seems to accord so well with dates and places,\r\n     that I have little doubt of the truth. It therefore only remains to\r\n     see what will become of Moreau. If he is dispatched, and that\r\n     quickly, there will be time and means to make Buonaparte suffer\r\n     severely for his late advanced move.\r\n\r\n     On the whole, the situation is, to be sure, very much improved\r\n     within these few weeks, but there is still enough for serious\r\n     alarm. The Directory has sent us the most insolent answer that can\r\n     be conceived; but as the substance of it is in some degree\r\n     ambiguous with respect to the main question of granting or refusing\r\n     the passport, it has been thought better not to leave a loop-hole\r\n     or pretence to them, or their adherents here, to lay upon us the\r\n     breaking the business off. Another note is therefore to be sent\r\n     to-day, by a flag of truce from Dover, in which the demand of the\r\n     passport is renewed in such terms as seem most likely to bring that\r\n     point to a distinct issue, ay or no. In other times, this last step\r\n     would have been not only superfluous, but humiliating; in the\r\n     present moment, the object of unanimity here in the great body of\r\n     the country, with respect to the large sacrifices they will be\r\n     called upon to make, is paramount to every other consideration.\r\n\r\n     I am extremely anxious to find that the plan in question may appear\r\n     practicable. The advantages of it would be infinite.\r\n\r\n     Ever most affectionately yours,\r\n     G.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the efforts which were making in England to sustain the\r\nwar may be partially inferred from the following letter. Lord Grenville,\r\nit will be seen, notes with a mark of admiration a subscription of\r\nL100,000 from the Duke of Bedford. The circumstance was singular and\r\nsignificant, the Duke of Bedford having all along taken a leading part\r\nin the House of Lords in opposition to hostilities, and in calling for\r\nvotes of censure and opprobrium upon the Ministry. He had been the chief\r\nmover of all those resolutions that protested against the expenditure to\r\nwhich the country had been put for the maintenance of the war, and now\r\nhe was one of the largest of the voluntary subscribers to a fund for its\r\ncontinuance.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Dropmore, Dec. 2nd, 1796.\r\n     MY DEAREST BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     I have been followed here to-night by a letter, to mention that\r\n     above twelve millions are already subscribed to the loan, and that\r\n     it may very probably be full to-morrow, so that I had no time to\r\n     lose in doing what of course the public will expect from me. I have\r\n     therefore desired that L10,000 may be subscribed to-morrow in my\r\n     name; and I imagine that by getting Coutts to advance the two first\r\n     payments, and transferring the stock, at whatever loss, the moment\r\n     it is transferable, I shall be able _me tirer d'affaire_, better\r\n     than I had hoped. It was my intention to have written to you\r\n     to-morrow, to let you know what other persons in your sort of\r\n     situation and class had done; but what I have now heard, makes me\r\n     think that I ought to send to you without delay, in order that you\r\n     may know how the thing stands, and of course afterwards judge for\r\n     yourself whether to do anything, and what.\r\n\r\n     The only names that have been mentioned to me, except among my\r\n     colleagues, are the Duke of Bridgewater and the Duke of Bedford!\r\n     each L100,000, and Lord Romney and Lord Carrington each L40,000,\r\n     besides L100,000, which the house of Smith and Co. subscribe as\r\n     bankers.\r\n\r\n     Lord Spencer, Lord Liverpool, Pitt and Dundas, subscribe L10,000,\r\n     as I have done; the two last will, I believe, have still more\r\n     difficulty in finding it than I shall.\r\n\r\n     You will, of course, not imagine that by sending to you in this\r\n     manner, I have the least idea of saying or suggesting to you to do\r\n     anything but what may have occurred to yourself, but I thought you\r\n     would naturally expect to hear these particulars from me.\r\n\r\n     Other news I have none. There was a report yesterday that Kehl was\r\n     surprised by the Austrians, but I could not trace it to any certain\r\n     source.\r\n\r\n     God bless you, my dear brother.\r\n\r\nThe time had now arrived when the English Cabinet believed that an\r\nattempt might be made to negotiate for peace, without compromising its\r\nhonour. In the preceding March, the ambassador to the Helvetic States\r\nhad been authorized to inquire of the Government of France, through the\r\nmedium of their representative, whether they were disposed to entertain\r\nsuch a negotiation. The answer was so unsatisfactory, laying down as a\r\nperemptory condition the retention of all those conquests which, during\r\nthe course of the war, had been annexed to the republic, that nothing\r\nmore was then done in the matter. The subject was resumed in September,\r\nand, the Directory having signified their readiness to grant passports\r\nto any persons who should be furnished with full powers and official\r\npapers, Lord Malmesbury was appointed as plenipotentiary on the part of\r\nHis Britannic Majesty to treat for peace with the French Republic. On\r\nthe 22nd of October his Lordship announced to M. de la Croix, the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs, his arrival in Paris in that capacity. The\r\nnegotiations occupied nearly two months, and the main point of\r\ndifficulty turned upon the Netherlands, Lord Malmesbury, who acted\r\nstrictly on his instructions, making the restoration of the Netherlands\r\na _sine qua non_, and M. de la Croix repeatedly stating that this\r\ndifficulty was one which could not be overcome. The negotiations had\r\narrived at that stage which made this insuperable difficulty perfectly\r\nclear and unmistakeable on both sides, when Mr. Talbot, a gentleman\r\nconnected with Lord Malmesbury's embassy, addressed the following letter\r\nto Lord Buckingham. No allusion will be found in it to the pending\r\nnegotiations, which were of too delicate and important a nature to be\r\ntouched upon in a private letter; but it is very curious and\r\ninteresting, as presenting a picture of the state of France at that\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. TALBOT TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Paris, Dec. 18th, 1796.\r\n     MY LORD,\r\n\r\n     Your Lordship, I trust, is aware of my motives for not having\r\n     written to you since I left England; I shall, therefore, make no\r\n     apologies for my neglect; but I must beg leave to assure your\r\n     Lordship that I am, notwithstanding the urgency of my reasons, so\r\n     much ashamed of the omission, that I now feel much embarrassed in\r\n     taking up my pen.\r\n\r\n     The only letters I have hitherto sent to England have been to Lord\r\n     Grenville, in answer to those he has done me the honour to write;\r\n     and to Mr. B. Taylor, his secretary, for some articles which I\r\n     stood in need of.\r\n\r\n     Your Lordship has without doubt received much better accounts of\r\n     the appearance and state of things in this country than it is in my\r\n     power to communicate; however, I will attempt a description of what\r\n     has struck me as worthy of notice, and rely upon your kind\r\n     indulgence for my errors.\r\n\r\n     Our first entrance into France was certainly not attended with the\r\n     reception which might have been expected, under the particular\r\n     circumstances in which we came. It is true a good many people of\r\n     all sorts were upon the quay at Calais when we arrived, but they\r\n     showed no signs of joy or any other feeling more than the arrival\r\n     of an indifferent vessel would have occasioned; and very shortly\r\n     after we had landed, and gone to the inn, the crowd was dispersed,\r\n     and everything seemed as silent as if nothing had happened. Indeed,\r\n     all those we conversed with expressed their happiness at seeing us,\r\n     and wished success to the negotiation; and all the principal\r\n     officers of the Government stationed there waited upon Lord\r\n     Malmesbury with the utmost civility; but the bulk of the\r\n     inhabitants--whether they were ignorant of the arrival of an envoy\r\n     to propose peace, or whether they were afraid to express their\r\n     satisfaction in any public manner, I cannot say--manifested not the\r\n     least sign of rejoicing.\r\n\r\n     Nothing very material occurred between this place and Paris. The\r\n     aubergistes and post-masters were almost the only persons with whom\r\n     we had any conversation, and their language uniformly was that\r\n     France was most anxiously desirous for the restoration of peace;\r\n     that their sufferings had been more than they could describe, but\r\n     that latterly their situation was much mended by the diminution in\r\n     the price of provisions. But I was not inclined to give much credit\r\n     to them, imagining that this language was intended to flatter us,\r\n     and coming from those who had suffered more than any of their\r\n     description in France, from the intercourse between the two\r\n     countries being stopped. It must, however, be allowed that a\r\n     general gloom seemed to prevail; and very little of that gaiety for\r\n     which this nation was formerly remarkable was to be observed. At\r\n     Amiens, I remember, the people of the inn where we supped entered\r\n     more fully and with less reserve into the detail of their\r\n     calamities. There had been a considerable manufacture of woollen\r\n     cloths in this town, in which at this time no more than two hundred\r\n     people were employed.\r\n\r\n     I profited of the opportunity which the changing horses afforded me\r\n     to see the Chateau of Chantilly. I found it totally stripped of its\r\n     furniture, and every decoration that bore the smallest reference to\r\n     armorial bearings was defaced; but otherwise the building has not\r\n     suffered much injury. The statue of the great Conde on the\r\n     principal staircase remains, but the head is cut off. The\r\n     barbarians were not content with beheading the statues of men, but\r\n     they have likewise done so to all the busts of stags placed over\r\n     the stalls in the stables. The chateau was used as a prison in the\r\n     time of Robespierre, and almost all the apartments continue still\r\n     divided into small spaces for that purpose. The gardens are totally\r\n     destroyed, but the park has met with no injury further than the\r\n     almost total destruction of the game. There is a keeper appointed\r\n     by the nation for the protection of the wood. The timber on the\r\n     opposite side of the river is chiefly cut down, the land having\r\n     been sold.\r\n\r\n     The adjacent chateau of the Duc d'Angouleme, his son, as far as the\r\n     walls, remains perfect; I had not time to see the inside of it. The\r\n     care of the chateau has lately been given in charge to one of the\r\n     former servants of the Prince de Conde.\r\n\r\n     The roads were in general in excellent condition, and the\r\n     post-horses tolerably good; but we were in several places kept some\r\n     time waiting for them. This is not to be wondered at, if we\r\n     consider how little they have been accustomed to travellers for\r\n     some years past.\r\n\r\n     A great number of the best houses by the roadside and in the towns\r\n     were shut up, and seemed to be abandoned. Very few of the churches\r\n     appeared to be open, many of them were pulled down, and none that\r\n     were not considerably damaged; but the country was throughout in a\r\n     state of high cultivation, although there was apparently a scarcity\r\n     of men at work. This is to be accounted for by the encouragement\r\n     which the late dearness of bread has given to the farmers, who are\r\n     become, by a variety of circumstances, extremely wealthy. They are\r\n     one of the very few descriptions of people who have profited by the\r\n     Revolution. Very many of them have purchased lands, and this they\r\n     were enabled to do almost for nothing by the depreciation of\r\n     assignats, for an enormous nominal value of which they sold the\r\n     produce of their farms; and this paper was received from them for\r\n     the sum it represented, in payment for the estates of the\r\n     _ci-devant_ seigneurs and other confiscated property. I am told\r\n     there have been repeated instances of the basest ingratitude on\r\n     their part, in denouncing their landlords; and, on the contrary,\r\n     that many of them have given proofs of the strongest attachment to\r\n     them.\r\n\r\n     Provisions are in abundance, and at a very moderate price. Common\r\n     bread is little more than two sous, and butchers' meat from five to\r\n     eight sous the pound.\r\n\r\n     I have not observed any want of specie in circulation; never yet\r\n     have I found any difficulty in getting change upon the purchase of\r\n     any article, nor any such thing as paper money produced in such\r\n     transactions. The exhausted state and the degree of distress which\r\n     I could discover in this country, I must confess, fell short of the\r\n     expectation which the various species of plunder, exaction, and\r\n     cruelty, which it has for several years submitted to, had impressed\r\n     upon my mind.\r\n\r\n     Between Calais and Paris, scarcely any troops were to be met with.\r\n\r\n     The scene being so perfectly new to me, and having little or no\r\n     intercourse with any one here, except our own society, I was some\r\n     time in Paris before I could form any opinion of the state of\r\n     affairs, and the sentiments of the people. The streets seemed\r\n     crowded, the shops tolerably well supplied, the theatres well\r\n     attended, some private and a great number of public carriages to be\r\n     met with; all this brought to my reflection how very difficult a\r\n     matter it must be to destroy a great country, considering that all\r\n     the pains which have been taken to ruin this have left so much\r\n     undone. But the first fortnight we lived in the most populous part\r\n     of the town, near the Palais Royal, and therefore the last place\r\n     where distress would be evident.\r\n\r\n     There are few parts of Paris I have not since been in, and I find\r\n     in many of them, the outlets particularly, the greatest\r\n     wretchedness to prevail, and to be very thin of inhabitants. A\r\n     great part of the Faubourg St. Germain, near the Boulevards, is in\r\n     a great measure deserted; but this quarter was formerly inhabited\r\n     principally by the noblesse. There is scarcely a street in Paris\r\n     where there are not several houses written upon, _Propriete\r\n     nationale a vendre_, and sometimes in addition, _ou a louer_; and\r\n     in many places a great part of the street is in the same manner\r\n     advertised for sale.\r\n\r\n     The names of many of the streets are, as your Lordship must know,\r\n     entirely changed; but where they are not, and began with _Saint_,\r\n     that word is invariably defaced, and the remainder of the name is\r\n     left untouched. But, notwithstanding that, most places are commonly\r\n     called as formerly; and this practice is becoming more general\r\n     every day.\r\n\r\n     The hotels of many of the _ci-devant_ noblesse are inhabited by the\r\n     Ministers and other members of the Government. Many of them are\r\n     converted into public offices and others of them into _hotels\r\n     garnis_, &c.; besides, a prodigious number of them remain\r\n     unoccupied, and offered for sale by the nation.\r\n\r\n     The Luxembourg is divided into five separate habitations for the\r\n     Directory, besides the apartments that are used for their sittings,\r\n     audiences, and other public business.\r\n\r\n     The Council of Ancients hold their sittings in the Palace of the\r\n     Tuileries, and the Council of Five Hundred meet in what was\r\n     formerly the riding-house of the King; but this is considered as\r\n     merely a temporary chamber for this last body, until the Palais\r\n     Bourbon, which is now undergoing great alterations and additions,\r\n     is ready for their reception. This building is in the Faubourg St.\r\n     Germain, in front of the new bridge called Pont de la Revolution. I\r\n     shall take an opportunity hereafter of giving your Lordship a\r\n     description of the interior of these several places.\r\n\r\n     The scene of any great revolutionary event continues still\r\n     decorated with the national flag and other emblems of their\r\n     _glorious_ Revolution, accompanied with an inscription; that where\r\n     the Bastille stood is, _14 Juillet 1789, la Bastille detruite, et\r\n     elle ne se relevera jamais_; and that in the Place du Carrousel,\r\n     opposite the Tuileries, is, _10 Aout 1792, La Royaute francaise est\r\n     abolie, et elle ne se relevera jamais_. There are several marks of\r\n     cannon-balls, but they have made but little impression on this\r\n     front of the Tuileries; and under each of them is written, _10 Aout\r\n     1792_.\r\n\r\n     The garden of the Tuileries is, I am told, kept as well as ever it\r\n     was; some of the largest trees in it, however, have been cut down\r\n     since our arrival, but they were chiefly decayed. Of the Bastille\r\n     nothing remains, except a very small part of the foundations; and\r\n     near it is a newly-erected powder magazine, and much of the\r\n     remainder of the space is a depot for firewood.\r\n\r\n     The churches are many of them open, and have Divine service\r\n     performed in them without restraint; but a great many more of them\r\n     are shut, and some used as _casernes_, storehouses, &c.; but they\r\n     have all been stripped of every internal decoration, and nothing\r\n     suffered to remain but the bare walls. Sometimes, indeed--and it\r\n     appears to be by an oversight--a piece of painting, or perhaps a\r\n     little image, may have escaped injury; but such a thing is a\r\n     curiosity, and to be found in a situation not readily to be\r\n     observed, or difficult to be reached. The favourite mode of\r\n     mutilating a statue seems to have been to break off the head. In\r\n     the church of St. Sulpice there is a tolerably good statue of a\r\n     Virgin and Child remaining, but of this the Child's head is taken\r\n     off, and that of the Virgin seems to have met with the same fate,\r\n     but to have been restored. It is wonderful the industry that has\r\n     been used in the destruction of everything in the way of\r\n     inscription, of sculpture, or coats of arms, which could possibly\r\n     remind the people of the _ancien regime_; and I cannot help being\r\n     much surprised that all this was done with so much care as to\r\n     remove merely these particular objects of their enmity, without in\r\n     the least damaging the adjacent parts. In defacing armorial\r\n     bearings and things of this sort, the reformers have been at the\r\n     trouble of cutting them away, so as to leave the shield quite\r\n     plain, although they were carved in stone. I should have supposed\r\n     that mischief done in the moment of frenzy would not have been so\r\n     methodical.\r\n\r\n     Upon all the public buildings, the public offices, and many others,\r\n     is written in large characters--_Unite indivisibilite de la\r\n     republique, liberte, egalite, fraternite, ou la mort_; but in\r\n     general the last word is rubbed out. The nation took it into their\r\n     heads not to like death upon the downfall of Robespierre. Upon many\r\n     of the churches is this inscription--_Le peuple francais reconnait\r\n     l'etre supreme et l'immortalite de l'ame._ This was a decree of the\r\n     Convention for the people at large, and your Lordship will allow\r\n     that this must have a ridiculous effect upon the walls of a church\r\n     entirely in ruins, as is often the case. Another modern inscription\r\n     is--_Citoyens, respectez le bien d'autrui, c'est le fruit de son\r\n     travail et de son industrie_; and perhaps close by it you may read\r\n     _propriete nationale a vendre_, in direct violation of the other,\r\n     offering to sell property of which some unfortunate person has been\r\n     robbed by the very preachers of this doctrine.\r\n\r\n     I am obliged to break off suddenly, for reasons which will be very\r\n     soon known to your Lordship.\r\n\r\n     I have the honour to be your Lordship's most obedient, faithful,\r\n     humble servant,\r\n\r\n     JAMES TALBOT.\r\n\r\nThe last line of this letter is written in an agitated hand, which the\r\ncircumstance that compelled Mr. Talbot to break off so abruptly\r\nsufficiently accounts for. At that moment a note had arrived at the\r\nembassy from M. de la Croix, giving Lord Malmesbury notice to depart\r\nfrom Paris in eight-and-forty hours, adding that if the British Cabinet\r\nwere desirous of peace, the Executive Directory were ready to carry on\r\nthe negotiations, on the basis they had already laid down, by the\r\nreciprocal channel of couriers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1797.\r\n\r\nDISCONTENTS IN ENGLAND--THE BREST SQUADRON--MOTION ON THE STATE OF\r\nIRELAND--AFFAIRS OF THE CONTINENT--LORD MALMESBURY'S MISSION TO LISLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe result of Lord Malmesbury's mission was communicated to Parliament\r\nas soon as it became known in London, by a message from the King, and\r\naddresses were moved approving of the conduct of Ministers. Amendments,\r\ncondemning their policy, and demanding an investigation, were proposed\r\nin both Houses, and rejected by large majorities. In the House of\r\nCommons, notwithstanding an appeal of extraordinary eloquence and power\r\nfrom Mr. Fox, the address was carried by a majority of 212 to 37. Mr.\r\nPitt's position, perhaps, was never stronger than at this moment,\r\nalthough the affairs of the Bank of England, in consequence of repeated\r\nloans to Government, were reduced to the most desperate condition, and\r\nthe lower classes of the population, feeling heavily the burthens of the\r\nwar, began to clamour against its prosecution. But the national spirit\r\nsustained the Government. Possessing the implicit confidence of the\r\nKing, the two Houses of Parliament, the heads of the Church, the landed\r\ninterest, and the monied and commercial classes, Mr. Pitt persevered.\r\nThe greatest efforts were made out of doors to induce His Majesty to\r\nremove his Ministers. Public meetings were held in several places to get\r\nup petitions on the subject; and the energies of the Opposition were\r\nincessantly employed in spreading alarm and discontent through the\r\ncountry. Several unfortunate circumstances concurred to give effect to\r\nthese movements. The war had reached its most disastrous point. England\r\nwas left alone in the field to contend against the power of France, now\r\ngrown haughty and formidable by a long course of successes. The credit\r\nof the country, under this pressure of events, was seriously affected.\r\nThe Bank had stopped payment. Two mutinies had broken out in the fleet,\r\none at Spithead, and another at the Nore. An organization of malcontents\r\nhad been formed in Ireland under the name of \"the United Irishmen,\" and\r\nhad carried their insurrectionary views so far as to send deputies to\r\ntreat with the French for assistance to enable them to throw off the\r\nEnglish yoke. The year opened with the most gloomy prospects on all\r\nsides; but the firmness of Ministers triumphed over all difficulties,\r\nand conducted them to its close with the happiest results.\r\n\r\nThe first incident of the year to which allusion is made in these\r\nletters, is the appearance in British waters of a French squadron. It\r\nconsisted of two frigates and two sloops, and its insignificance,\r\ncompared with the demonstration that was anticipated from the loud\r\nthreats of invasion by which it was heralded, excited ridicule rather\r\nthan alarm.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Wednesday, Jan. 4th, 1797.\r\n     MY DEAREST BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     A little after eleven this morning came an account of Elphinston's\r\n     being arrived with the 'Monarch' (I believe at Spithead). He had\r\n     letters from General Dalrymple of the 31st, by which it seems\r\n     probable that the French fleet is, if not entirely, certainly in\r\n     great part, broken to pieces. Two French seventy-fours and a\r\n     frigate had put into Bantry Bay, one without a bowsprit, and all of\r\n     them damaged, and were lying within mortar reach of Bantry when\r\n     Dalrymple wrote: other vessels were seen also trying to get into\r\n     Bantry Bay. The 'Impatiente,' a very fine frigate of forty-four\r\n     guns, just reached Cuxhaven, and foundered there, the whole crew\r\n     going down with her except a pilot and four men, who were saved. By\r\n     their report twelve thousand men only were on board, and provisions\r\n     so scarce from the first, that they were put upon short allowance\r\n     the day that they left Brest. Another French frigate was seen\r\n     driving up St. George's Channel, and is said to have gone to pieces\r\n     upon the Welsh coast. A Barbadoes ship saw a large ship, supposed\r\n     to be one of the flutes, struggle some time, and then founder;\r\n     another of the flutes was seen to founder off the Lizard; and great\r\n     traces of wreck are thrown upon the Irish coast.\r\n\r\n     Lord Bridport sailed very early yesterday morning, and met\r\n     Elphinston, who gave him all this intelligence. I presume that he\r\n     will probably detach part of his squadron towards Ireland, and part\r\n     towards Brest; besides which, I believe he has power to take with\r\n     him whatever he meets.\r\n\r\n     Kingsnill was indefatigable in collecting his frigates, which, with\r\n     his two sixty-fours, will count heavily upon this shattered and\r\n     disabled force of the enemy. Meantime, the greatest part of the\r\n     Oporto fleet is come in, and very good accounts are received from\r\n     the West Indies, where a strong naval force is gone down to the\r\n     protection of Jamaica. One of the frigates, too, upon that station\r\n     has taken a rich Spanish prize. Of the four ships out belonging to\r\n     Colpoys' fleet, all are come in except the 'Powerful,' which is\r\n     thought to have made Ireland. Upon the whole, therefore, you will\r\n     admit that I send you to-day a very prosperous naval budget. In\r\n     truth, I do think that, if the ruin of this French expedition be as\r\n     complete as it promises to be from these circumstances, the\r\n     security of Ireland, and of England too, has been more promoted by\r\n     it than by any event which has happened during the war; and much as\r\n     I applaud your manly and forward zeal in your military offer, I\r\n     doubt whether the occasion for it will again be renewed. I ought to\r\n     have mentioned to you that the four men saved from the 'Impatiente'\r\n     describe the troops on board as having been from the first highly\r\n     dissatisfied and discontented with the expedition, and that twelve\r\n     thousand, instead of twenty thousand, sailed, because it was found\r\n     difficult to persuade the troops in general to embark in the\r\n     enterprise. The result will therefore add to the ill-temper upon\r\n     this subject, and Irish invasion will for a long time be no popular\r\n     measure in the harbour of Brest. Stay then at Stowe, my dear\r\n     brother, and enjoy the satisfaction which you will feel in the\r\n     prompt and handsome service which you were ready to have done.\r\n     _Laudo momentem_--not so (_between ourselves_)--do I say to\r\n     Elphinston. I do not know what is his pretence for coming away with\r\n     the 'Monarch' in such a moment, but I shrewdly suspect his Cape\r\n     treasure to have been on board and to have influenced his decision;\r\n     if that is the case, of which I know nothing, I do think it will be\r\n     disgraceful beyond all measure, but I am speaking my own\r\n     conjectures only, for I have not had time yet to ask more. God\r\n     bless you.\r\n\r\nThe sequel of the expedition was sufficiently ludicrous. Having\r\neffected a landing of some fifteen hundred men on the shore of the Bay\r\nof Cardigan on the 23rd of February, the militia, fencibles, and\r\npeasantry of the neighbourhood immediately collected; but the invaders\r\nsaved them the trouble of an engagement, by laying down their arms, and\r\nsurrendering themselves prisoners of war. The frigates were captured on\r\ntheir return to Brest; and thus terminated an enterprize, which was so\r\ninadequately planned, as to create universal astonishment that it was\r\never undertaken.\r\n\r\nThe state of Ireland offered a favourable opportunity to the Opposition\r\nfor an attack upon Ministers; and Lord Fitzwilliam, having failed in his\r\nattempts to bring them into discredit in reference to his own case, now\r\nextended the grounds of accusation to the general discontents of the\r\ncountry. Lord Moira, who undertook to bring forward the motion, appears\r\nto have had no other object in view than to trace all these disorders to\r\nthe recal of Lord Fitzwilliam.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Cleveland Row, March 14th, 1797\r\n     MY DEAREST BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     Lord Moira (having given to Government, through the Lord\r\n     Chancellor, a sort of intimation that he was what he called _going_\r\n     into Opposition) has this day given notice of a motion for Tuesday\r\n     next, to address the King on the internal state of Ireland, which\r\n     motion he is understood to have concerted with Lord Fitzwilliam.\r\n\r\n     You know I never think of pressing you to attend on any of the\r\n     common points of attack and defence between the Government and\r\n     Opposition. But on this occasion I should certainly most ardently\r\n     wish that you should be present, and I think you yourself would not\r\n     wish to be absent. At all events, I thought it right not to omit a\r\n     moment giving you notice of it, that if you meant to attend you\r\n     might arrange other matters accordingly. It is, however, not quite\r\n     certain that he will make the motion that day, the Chancellor being\r\n     too ill to come out; but he seems resolved, even if Lord\r\n     Loughborough's illness continues, not to defer it for more than two\r\n     or three days longer.\r\n\r\n     We have nothing new to-day. The Archduke is got back to the army in\r\n     Italy, and will, I hope, at least be able to prevent any further\r\n     progress of the French on that side. Mack is to be sent to the\r\n     Rhine.\r\n\r\n     Ever most affectionately yours,\r\n     G.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Cleveland Row, March 20th, 1797.\r\n     MY DEAREST BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     Lord Moira persists obstinately in bringing on his motion\r\n     to-morrow. I suppose they attach some political importance to the\r\n     having had the discussion with us before it comes on in the House\r\n     of Commons, for I can conceive no other reason for this\r\n     pertinaciousness. The Chancellor will not be there, so that I shall\r\n     have the whole battle, or nearly so, upon my shoulders. It is not,\r\n     however, the first time that this has happened to me, and most\r\n     probably it will not be the last; and I have no uneasiness as to\r\n     the result in point of effect or impression, even though the Prince\r\n     of Wales should (as is said) be persuaded that this is an occasion\r\n     in which it befits his station and prospects to put himself\r\n     forward.\r\n\r\n     There is no news nor much appearance of any, as both armies and in\r\n     both quarters seem to want much time to repair the effects of the\r\n     last campaign. It is some satisfaction to see that Buonaparte is in\r\n     no situation to push his advantages further as yet; and before he\r\n     is, I hope and trust the Emperor will have collected an army,\r\n     _better generalled_ and able to resist the French, who are,\r\n     however, drawing all their strength to that side.\r\n\r\n     The elections are going on quietly in France. What the result will\r\n     be, I believe nobody knows, and it is therefore in vain to guess.\r\n\r\n     Ever most affectionately yours,\r\n     G.\r\n\r\n     Pray accept our kindest remembrance to Lady B. and yourself, on the\r\n     celebration of to-morrow, and convey them to Lord and Lady T.\r\n\r\nThe motion was brought forward the next day, and negatived by a majority\r\nof nearly four to one. A similar motion brought forward by Mr. Fox two\r\ndays afterwards in the House of Common, met with a similar reception.\r\n\r\nAbout this time Lord Mornington was appointed Governor of Madras, in the\r\nroom of Mr. Hobart, now Lord Hobart, upon whom that office had been\r\nconferred in the year 1794. The following letters refer to that\r\nappointment, and are explanatory of the circumstances under which it was\r\nmade.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD MORNINGTON TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Hertford Street, April 20th, 1797.\r\n     MY DEAR LORD,\r\n\r\n     I received your very kind and affectionate letter last night at\r\n     Dropmore, where I had been for a few days. When you were last in\r\n     town, the projects of arrangement for India remained so nearly in\r\n     the state in which our last conversation had left them, that I\r\n     thought it unnecessary to trouble you at that time on the subject.\r\n     Since that time, the matter has certainly taken a more distinct\r\n     shape, although it is not true, as the newspaper has stated, that\r\n     my appointment has actually taken place, or that I am to embark\r\n     within a few days for India. Had you continued in town, I would\r\n     have communicated to you, step by step, every stage of the\r\n     transaction, and especially whatever concerned Hobart; but the\r\n     distance of your situation rendered such a detailed communication\r\n     difficult, and I was besides unwilling to intrude upon your time in\r\n     a moment of so much domestic anxiety, in which, I assure you, I\r\n     took the deepest concern. I also had an expectation that Mr.\r\n     Sullivan, with whom I had constant intercourse, might have had the\r\n     opportunity of seeing you in Buckinghamshire (if Lord Temple's\r\n     health should allow you to see anybody), and that he would have\r\n     apprised you of every circumstance which could affect Hobart's\r\n     interest or reputation; to both of which objects, it is my sincere\r\n     opinion that the utmost regard has been shown by all parties in\r\n     this affair: I say by _all_ parties, because common justice compels\r\n     me to declare that Mr. Dundas, instead of having impeded or\r\n     frustrated the arrangement proposed for Hobart, or of having\r\n     sacrificed him to any intrigue at the India House, has to my\r\n     certain knowledge asserted Hobart's cause with the warmest zeal,\r\n     used every means of representing it to the Company in the most\r\n     advantageous light, and even entered into personal engagements for\r\n     the benefit of Hobart far exceeding any demand which could justly\r\n     or reasonably have been made upon him by Hobart or by his friends.\r\n     A short statement of facts will, I think, satisfy you of the truth\r\n     of my opinion.\r\n\r\n     After a very full consideration of all the despatches both from\r\n     Bengal and Madras, relating to the affairs of the latter\r\n     Government, Mr. Dundas wrote a letter to the Directors, of which he\r\n     sent me a copy, expressing his sense of Lord Hobart's services in\r\n     these words: \"To his zeal and promptitude in the execution of his\r\n     orders, after the unfortunate rupture with Holland, I in a very\r\n     great degree attribute the very proud and advantageous situation in\r\n     which our Indian empire is now placed.\" The letter concludes with\r\n     the following recommendation to the Court to make a provision for\r\n     Lord Hobart: \"If the Court of Directors concur with me in thinking\r\n     that Lord Hobart has performed very meritorious services, but that\r\n     there are at the same time very forcible grounds of expediency why\r\n     he should not proceed to the higher situation originally destined\r\n     for him, I can have no doubt, from the known justice and liberality\r\n     of the East India Company, that they will concur with me in\r\n     thinking that he ought not to return to his own country without a\r\n     substantial mark of the approbation and favour of the East India\r\n     Company.\"\r\n\r\n     The grounds of expediency for Lord Hobart's recal, Mr. Dundas\r\n     stated in these terms: \"I am, after the most mature consideration\r\n     of the subject, thoroughly satisfied that, after the unfortunate\r\n     misunderstandings which have prevailed between Lord Hobart and the\r\n     Government-General, and the equally unfortunate differences which\r\n     exist between his Lordship and the Nabob and the Rajah of Tanjore,\r\n     it would be inexpedient to re-appoint him to the\r\n     Government-General; and still more so, that he should remain longer\r\n     at Madras.\"\r\n\r\n     Upon this letter, my dear Lord, I am persuaded that your own\r\n     justice and candour will anticipate my observations; but the very\r\n     strong expressions contained in your letter render it my duty to\r\n     observe, that in this application to the Court of Directors, Mr.\r\n     Dundas has chosen the very same topics, on which to urge the claims\r\n     of Lord Hobart to the gratitude of the Company, which you concurred\r\n     with me in selecting as the most favourable grounds to found a\r\n     public motion in the Court of Proprietors, with a view to\r\n     obtaining a pension for Lord Hobart; and Mr. Dundas has stated the\r\n     expediency of removing Lord Hobart on no other grounds than those\r\n     which in conversation you and I have repeatedly agreed to be of the\r\n     greatest force, and at the same time perfectly consistent with Lord\r\n     Hobart's fair reputation and unsullied honour. It cannot,\r\n     therefore, be denied that Mr. Dundas has dealt fairly by Lord\r\n     Hobart's character and interests, both in the reasons assigned for\r\n     his recal, and in those urged in favour of his services.\r\n\r\n     To this letter the Chairman of the Court of Directors returned an\r\n     answer, concurring in Mr. Dundas's opinion of the necessity of\r\n     recalling Lord Hobart, admitting the extent of his services, and\r\n     expressing the inclination of the Court to propose a provision for\r\n     him to the consideration of the proprietors; but postponing the\r\n     moment for making that proposal to a period which appeared to me\r\n     rather too distant, and not sufficiently defined.\r\n\r\n     In this state of the matter, Mr. Dundas proposed to me the\r\n     reversion of the Government-General after Lord Cornwallis, having\r\n     previously furnished me with a copy of the correspondence, to which\r\n     I have already referred. I expressed my doubts whether the\r\n     provision for Lord Hobart was yet sufficiently secure to admit of\r\n     my accepting the offer made to me consistently with my good wishes\r\n     for him. Mr. Dundas then informed me, that he knew the intention of\r\n     the Directors was to propose the pension to the Court of\r\n     Proprietors in May; and he added, that if at that time the pension\r\n     should fail in either court, he would himself move it in\r\n     Parliament, and charge it upon the revenues of Ceylon, or take some\r\n     other effectual means of securing it. He also said, that there\r\n     would be no objection to calling Lord Hobart to the House of Peers\r\n     within a very short time, probably even before Lord Cornwallis's\r\n     departure.\r\n\r\n     Here again I must observe, that Mr. Dundas offers a personal\r\n     pledge in favour of Lord Hobart, which neither you nor I, nor any\r\n     of Lord Hobart's friends ever had required, and which we could not\r\n     on any fair grounds have demanded. When Mr. Dundas had thus stated\r\n     to me the situation of Lord Hobart in terms so perfectly\r\n     satisfactory, and affording such undeniable proofs of his sincere\r\n     wish to serve him under all possible contingencies, I entered into\r\n     a variety of points relating to my own views (which I will state to\r\n     you when we meet); and the conversation ended without my final\r\n     acceptance of the proposal made to me. In a day or two afterwards I\r\n     saw Mr. Sullivan, and communicated to him what had passed between\r\n     me and Mr. Dundas relative to Lord Hobart. I had then the\r\n     satisfaction to learn from Mr. Sullivan, that he also had seen Mr.\r\n     Dundas, from whom he had received the very same assurances, which\r\n     Mr. Dundas had given to me in relation to Lord Hobart's pension and\r\n     peerage; and Mr. Sullivan further stated, that Mr. Dundas had\r\n     desired that those assurances might be communicated to Lord\r\n     Guilford. I then asked Mr. Sullivan whether, under all the\r\n     circumstances of the case, he thought that my acceptance of the\r\n     Government of Madras, with the reversion of the Government-General\r\n     after Lord Cornwallis, could be in any degree injurious to Lord\r\n     Hobart's interest or honour? Mr. Sullivan answered, certainly it\r\n     could not; and added, that he and Lord Guilford were now perfectly\r\n     satisfied with the footing on which Mr. Dundas had placed the\r\n     credit and welfare of Lord Hobart.\r\n\r\n     Having seen Lord Cornwallis, and at length made up my mind to\r\n     undertake this most arduous charge, I communicated to Mr. Dundas\r\n     about a week ago my final acceptance of the Government of Madras,\r\n     with the provisional succession to Bengal after Lord Cornwallis. My\r\n     appointment not having yet been formally made by the Court of\r\n     Directors, I cannot yet acknowledge my destination to India; you\r\n     will, therefore, be so good as to speak of the whole matter merely\r\n     as a vague report until you hear further from me.\r\n\r\n     Thus, my dear Lord, you will perceive that whatever has been done\r\n     relating to Hobart in the conclusion of this arrangement for India,\r\n     has received the sanction of his nearest relations, of persons\r\n     whose affectionate friendship for Hobart, and just discernment of\r\n     his interests, will readily be acknowledged by you. In a situation\r\n     of peculiar delicacy and embarrassment, it has been a great\r\n     satisfaction to me to have been able to submit every step which I\r\n     have taken in this affair to the judgment of such a man as Mr.\r\n     Sullivan.\r\n\r\n     The various delays which have retarded the conclusion of this\r\n     arrangement, have rendered it impossible for me to embark with Lord\r\n     Cornwallis. However, I am in constant habits of the most\r\n     confidential intercourse with him from day to day; and I mean to\r\n     pass six weeks or two months with him in Bengal before his\r\n     resignation of the government. My departure will probably not take\r\n     place sooner than July or August.\r\n\r\n     Finding that the office of Private Civil Secretary at Bengal would\r\n     be well worth my brother Henry's acceptance, I mean to take him\r\n     with me. After a very accurate inquiry from Lord Cornwallis, I am\r\n     concerned to find that it would not be in my power to be of any\r\n     assistance to Mr. Fisher in India. My intention is to take no other\r\n     person, besides my servants, excepting my brother Henry, and to\r\n     avoid all engagements universally in Europe, in order to secure\r\n     myself against any temptation to an irregular distribution of\r\n     patronage. In this resolution, which I formed very early, on\r\n     principles which a long attention to the affairs of India has\r\n     enabled me to fix with some degree of confidence, I have been\r\n     strongly confirmed by Lord Cornwallis, and I am persuaded that you\r\n     will approve of my determination.\r\n\r\n     Pray accept my cordial thanks for the kindness and friendship\r\n     which appear in every part of your letter, and believe me, my dear\r\n     Lord, ever yours most faithfully and affectionately,\r\n\r\n     MORNINGTON.\r\n\r\n     I have been interrupted in this long detail, and have not been able\r\n     to send my letter until this evening, the 21st. I am happy to learn\r\n     in Pall Mall that Lord Temple is so much better. Nothing new to-day\r\n     from Portsmouth; I mean, nothing authentic. Private letters say\r\n     that the mutiny is likely to subside for the present, in\r\n     consequence of the propositions made yesterday by the Admiralty.\r\n     How discipline and subordination are ever again to be restored on\r\n     any permanent basis surpasses my understanding to conceive.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD MORNINGTON TO MR. SULLIVAN.\r\n\r\n     Hertford Street, July 3rd, 1797.\r\n     SIR,\r\n\r\n     The Court of Directors have appointed me Governor of Madras, with\r\n     the provisional succession to Bengal. The arrangement has been made\r\n     by them, and accepted by me, with this understanding: that I am to\r\n     undertake the Government of Madras only in the event of Lord\r\n     Cornwallis's acceptance of the Government of Bengal. If his\r\n     Lordship should not go to Bengal, I am to proceed directly to the\r\n     Supreme Government. The nature of this arrangement does not appear\r\n     upon the face of it: I state it to you in _strict confidence_, as\r\n     it has been explained to me; and I believe you are already\r\n     sufficiently acquainted with my sentiments to know my willingness\r\n     to hold the Government of Madras under Lord Cornwallis, as well as\r\n     my resolution not to hold it under any other person.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Dundas authorizes me to say that he retains the same intentions\r\n     with regard to a provision for Lord Hobart which he stated to you\r\n     and to me, and you have been already apprized by me of the footing\r\n     on which the proposed peerage stands. You may rely on my constant\r\n     and unremitting attention to both objects; but I must declare, in\r\n     justice both to Mr. Pitt and to Mr. Dundas, my conviction that\r\n     neither will delay the performance of their respective engagements\r\n     one instant beyond that in which it shall be possible to execute\r\n     them.\r\n\r\n     I find that Mr. Dundas considers himself to have given sufficient\r\n     intimation to Lord Hobart of the intended arrangements, as far as\r\n     they could affect his Lordship, by having enclosed to him, in a\r\n     despatch forwarded overland some months ago, a copy of the letter\r\n     addressed by Mr. Dundas to the Chairman of the Court of Directors\r\n     on the subject of Lord Hobart's pretensions to a mark of the\r\n     respect of the Company in the event of a change in the Government\r\n     of India.\r\n\r\n     To whatever situation I may be destined, whether to Madras or\r\n     Bengal, the maintenance of Lord Hobart's credit and reputation will\r\n     always be a leading object of my wishes; and I trust, before I\r\n     leave England, that I shall have the satisfaction of receiving your\r\n     advice with respect to the most effectual mode of combining the\r\n     accomplishment of that object with ideas, in some degree different\r\n     from those which have governed the policy of Lord Hobart's\r\n     administration at Madras in more than one material branch of the\r\n     public service.\r\n\r\n     I am, Sir, with great respect and esteem,\r\n     Your most faithful and humble servant,\r\n     MORNINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD MORNINGTON TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Hertford Street, July 19th, 1797.\r\n     MY DEAR LORD,\r\n\r\n     I assure you that I felt no difficulty or delicacy whatever in\r\n     communicating your letter to Mr. Pitt as soon as I received it, and\r\n     I flatter myself that throughout the whole of the arrangement\r\n     relative to India I have never been found deficient in any mark of\r\n     regard for my old friend Hobart's interest or honour. Mr. Pitt\r\n     authorized me to inform you that he would very soon write both to\r\n     you and to Lord Hobart; and to that letter, whenever you receive\r\n     it, I must refer you for the detail of facts on which Mr. Pitt is\r\n     more competent to afford explanation than I. I must however\r\n     declare, in justice both to Pitt and Dundas, that I see nothing in\r\n     the conduct of either to justify the least suspicion of any other\r\n     than the most cordial sentiments of good-will towards Hobart. I\r\n     have said the same thing to Mr. Sullivan, whom you will probably\r\n     see, and stated the grounds of my opinion at large. Mr. Pitt does\r\n     not appear to admit that Lord Hobart's interests ever have been or\r\n     can be made matter of negotiation. He says he has acted in the\r\n     whole transaction, and will continue to act, conformably to his\r\n     sense of public duty, and his unaltered feelings of friendship for\r\n     Lord Hobart, to whom he will not fail to give a full statement of\r\n     all his conduct. I believe Mr. Dundas's view of the subject to be\r\n     nearly the same; but not being at liberty to communicate your\r\n     letter to him, I have not been enabled to enter so fully with him\r\n     into the discussion of its contents. However, I can inform you that\r\n     his favourable intentions towards Lord Hobart remain precisely the\r\n     same.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Sullivan will immediately communicate in person with Mr. Dundas\r\n     on all the points of this business, and you will learn the result\r\n     from him.\r\n\r\n     Nothing but the continual hurry and interruptions to which I am at\r\n     present exposed could justify my having delayed so long the\r\n     acknowledgment of your kind letter. Pray, my dear Lord, accept my\r\n     cordial thanks for the many marks of friendship which it contains.\r\n     I do not expect to sail before September, and you may be assured\r\n     that I will make it my business to see you before my departure.\r\n\r\n     Ever, my dear Lord,\r\n     Yours most sincerely and affectionately,\r\n     MORNINGTON.\r\n\r\nThe remaining letters of the year refer at intervals to the events in\r\nprogress on the continent; events which occupy so large and prominent a\r\nspace in history, as to render any detailed allusion to them\r\nunnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Cleveland Row, April 28th, 1797\r\n     MY DEAREST BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     I have this day seen Dutheil, and to-morrow I am to see the other;\r\n     but there has been a blunder about it, or I should long since have\r\n     seen him. I hardly know how to credit all I hear on that subject,\r\n     and yet I must say I hear it from all quarters, agreeing in the\r\n     essentials, though varying a little as to sub-divisions, according\r\n     to the dispositions of the informants.\r\n\r\n     I hardly know how to tell myself, under these circumstances, what I\r\n     wish about Hammond's mission, because the panic here is so\r\n     disgraceful, that the country will not allow us to do them justice.\r\n     If I thought others _would_ do them that justice, my resolution\r\n     would soon be taken; but I have not nerves to plunge my country\r\n     into the horrors of a Jacobin Government to save myself the\r\n     unpleasant task of being compelled to do worse for them than I am\r\n     sure I could if they would but be quiet and suffer themselves to be\r\n     saved. It is a curious speculation in history to see how often the\r\n     good people of England have played this game over and over again,\r\n     and how incorrigible they are in it. To desire war without\r\n     reflection, to be unreasonably elated with success, to be still\r\n     more unreasonably depressed by difficulties, and to call out for\r\n     peace with an impatience which makes suitable terms unattainable,\r\n     are the established maxims and the regular progress of the popular\r\n     mind in this country. Yet, such as it is, it is worth all the other\r\n     countries of the world put together, so we must not too much\r\n     complain of it.\r\n\r\n     I am grieved to hear that your dear son has had another relapse,\r\n     and should be extremely obliged to you if, whenever you can send me\r\n     a better account, as I trust you will be able to do, you would let\r\n     me have a line.\r\n\r\n     Ever most affectionately yours,\r\n     G.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Cleveland Row, May 3rd, 1797.\r\n     MY DEAREST BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     The Paris papers arrived this morning seem to confirm, beyond a\r\n     doubt, the signature of peace with the Emperor. We know nothing\r\n     more of it than you will find in those papers. The last accounts\r\n     from Vienna which I have received were of the 17th, and they looked\r\n     more like war than peace; but not enough so to give me any reason\r\n     to doubt the fact.\r\n\r\n     The task which is now left to us, is no doubt arduous and\r\n     difficult. It would not be in the least so with a country united,\r\n     and feeling its own strength: but to contend against dejection,\r\n     cowardice and disaffection at home, aiding a powerful enemy from\r\n     without, is not a light or easy matter. It must, however, be tried;\r\n     for I have no conception that any other use can be made of this\r\n     event by the Directory, than that of exacting from us concessions,\r\n     which I trust neither the country nor Parliament will bring\r\n     themselves to listen to.\r\n\r\n     I hope you are all going on well at Stowe, and that your invalid is\r\n     recovering. Have you seen my Prince? He is sensible, and well\r\n     informed; though not exactly the picture of a young lover.\r\n\r\n     Ever most affectionately yours,\r\n     G.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Cleveland Row, May 5th, 1797.\r\n     MY DEAREST BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     The messenger is arrived this morning, and has brought us the\r\n     confirmation of the Paris reports. The preliminaries were signed on\r\n     the 18th; but we are still uninformed of the particulars of the\r\n     conditions, except that they contain a stipulation for a Congress\r\n     at Berne, to which the allies of the two parties are to be invited.\r\n     I believe, from what I can collect from the very defective\r\n     information which has yet reached us, that the articles have been\r\n     drawn in so much haste and confusion, and by persons so little used\r\n     to transact points of this nature, that they are unintelligible,\r\n     and require explanation before they can be made public, or even\r\n     communicated to other Courts. Thugut has resigned--this step having\r\n     been taken in contradiction to his opinion--and a Count Cobenzl,\r\n     now Austrian Minister at Petersburg, is supposed to be destined to\r\n     succeed him. This is, in the whole of it, a great event, and big\r\n     with the greatest consequences, whether good or bad--_caliginosa\r\n     nocte premit Deus_.\r\n\r\n     You cannot see the state of Ireland more gloomily than I do.\r\n     Possibly, if we have peace, that may leave us more at liberty to\r\n     act in that quarter; but even then, what force have we? and to what\r\n     objects are we to direct it, when the gentlemen are all flying from\r\n     their duty, and either joining the adverse standard, or at best\r\n     deserting their posts?\r\n\r\n     I rejoice to hear so good an account of your son, and I trust the\r\n     attack is now over, though the recovery of strength must naturally\r\n     be very slow.\r\n\r\n     Ever, my dear brother,\r\n     Most affectionately yours,\r\n     G.\r\n\r\n     Wells's ship's crew being harangued by him refused to cheer with\r\n     the other ships, till the 'Glory' loaded her guns to fire upon her.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. T. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Charles Street, May 9th, 1797.\r\n     MY DEAREST BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     I cannot express to you my disappointment in the Portsmouth news,\r\n     which I found upon my return to town yesterday evening. By the post\r\n     of Saturday, the letters from the fleet were better than they had\r\n     ever been; and the officers themselves seemed in much better heart\r\n     and spirits. On Sunday, however, it broke out afresh:\r\n     representations were handed about, complaining that the speeches of\r\n     Lord Howe, Lord Spencer and the Duke of Clarence, were meant to\r\n     disappoint the seamen of what had been promised them, and it was\r\n     suggested that the 'Marlborough' was to be kept back, and made an\r\n     example of when the fleet had sailed. Upon these pretences, the\r\n     delegates began going round to each ship: Colpoys told his crew he\r\n     would not admit them; they mutinied, and he ordered his marines to\r\n     fire, who did so, and badly wounded four mutineers; but the fire\r\n     was returned by the crew, who overpowered the officers and the\r\n     marines, confined Colpoys, and threatened to hang Lieutenant Bover.\r\n     To save him, Colpoys asserted that Bover had been ordered so to act\r\n     by him, and that he had an order for this discipline from the\r\n     Admiralty, which order he gave to the delegates. The order was a\r\n     very proper order from the Admiralty to every captain, requiring\r\n     him to give no cause of complaint to the men on the subject of\r\n     provisions, requiring him to keep up a proper discipline, and to\r\n     exert a proper spirit in resisting any appearance of mutiny. This\r\n     order, we since hear, is stated as an act of treachery in the\r\n     Admiralty as against the seamen.\r\n\r\n     Upon this tumult in the 'London,' the crews of the other ships\r\n     took possession of the arms, and many confined their officers to\r\n     their cabins. The post of to-day brings no new or different state\r\n     of things, except an account that three of the mutineers are dead\r\n     in Haslar Hospital of their wounds; and that Campbell, Nichols,\r\n     Talbot, one or two other captains, and many lieutenants, have been\r\n     put on shore at St. Helen's.\r\n\r\n     A messenger was dispatched last night with the news of the vote of\r\n     the House of Commons having passed unanimously, but it is doubtful\r\n     whether in this high wind he could get to the fleet; and all these\r\n     circumstances show so little colour or pretence of real complaint,\r\n     that I cannot help fearing the evil is more deeply rooted in the\r\n     influence of Jacobin emissaries and the Corresponding Society, and\r\n     to their machinations the vote of yesterday will afford no answer.\r\n     Upon the whole, this is the worst state of things which I have\r\n     seen. The ground of the mischief is not known to the officers, and\r\n     as far as I can see, they have no heart or nerves to meet this\r\n     formidable calamity. With this wind they might have sailed; but\r\n     with what has happened in the 'London,' and with so many officers\r\n     put on shore, one can hardly now wish the fleet to sail.\r\n\r\n     The last accounts from Brest announce about twenty sail, but not in\r\n     a very forward state of readiness; but this state of our fleet\r\n     cannot be news to them, and they will doubtless profit of an\r\n     opportunity which perhaps they have themselves created.\r\n\r\n     At half-past one no news was come. If I hear more before the post\r\n     goes out, I will add it.\r\n\r\n     God bless you, dearest brother.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. T. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Charles Street, May 11th, 1797.\r\n     MY DEAREST BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     Great anxiety again prevailed here by an account which arrived at\r\n     midnight, that the delegates were on board the 'London,' and it\r\n     was feared they were urging for the execution of Colpoys and his\r\n     captain; but a few hours afterwards, news arrived that Colpoys'\r\n     crew had resisted the delegates; that even the most mutinous ships,\r\n     viz. the 'Duke' and 'Mars,' were returned to their duty, and that\r\n     most of the ships had desired their officers to join them again. I\r\n     have also read a letter from Payne, who writes in high spirits, and\r\n     says that there is now a complete hostility on the part of the\r\n     well-affected as against the mutineers, and that he has just spoke\r\n     a cutter from the 'Queen Charlotte' with twenty or thirty\r\n     well-affected men on board, who were going to every ship in the\r\n     fleet, to insist upon everything being quiet, and upon their going\r\n     instantly to sail in quest of the French. Lord Howe would arrive\r\n     about nine this morning, with a warrant under the King's\r\n     sign-manual, for making such final arrangement as might be\r\n     necessary for the sailing of the fleet, if he should find it so\r\n     disposed to sail. Not a word from Lord Bridport, except to\r\n     acknowledge the communication of the Act of Parliament!\r\n\r\n     Under these circumstances, there is every reason to suppose that\r\n     one may hope the immediate storm is a little blown over, and that\r\n     no new resource need be looked for such as you suggest; but the\r\n     apprehension of my mind is still extremely great, because I am more\r\n     and more convinced that Jacobin management and influence is at the\r\n     bottom of this evil; and till that influence is traced and rooted\r\n     out, there is, in my view, no chance of safety. The tampering with\r\n     the soldiers by conversation and handbills is another unanswerable\r\n     proof of the system by which all this mischief moves forward; and\r\n     the activity of Brest in the last accounts, seems to confirm, as\r\n     far as such preparation can, their knowledge of, if not their\r\n     participation in, this mischief.\r\n\r\n     Orde has written from Plymouth, that he hopes to get the ships\r\n     there to sea before any communication is had of this new mutiny.\r\n\r\n     Things look badly, as I believe, in Ireland; but those of\r\n     Government, whom I ever see, are so entirely occupied, that I write\r\n     to you more from my own guess than from their communication.\r\n\r\n     God bless you, dearest brother.\r\n\r\n     I know no foreign news of any sort, nor have I seen William these\r\n     three or four last days.\r\n\r\nA third effort to effect a pacification with France had been entered\r\nupon by Lord Grenville in the month of June. On this occasion his\r\nLordship addressed a direct application to M. de la Croix, expressing\r\nhis readiness without delay to open a discussion of the views and\r\npretensions of both parties. To this communication M. de la Croix\r\nreplied by accepting the proposal; and the town of Lisle was appointed\r\nfor the meeting of the ambassadors.\r\n\r\nLord Malmesbury was again appointed on the part of England; and it\r\nbecame evident at once that his re-appearance in that capacity was not\r\nvery satisfactory to the French Government, M. de la Croix coldly\r\nsignifying the consent of the Directory to negotiate with Lord\r\nMalmesbury, but adding that another choice would have augured more\r\nfavourably for the speedy conclusion of peace.\r\n\r\nThe conference at Lisle seems to have taken its colour all throughout\r\nfrom this preliminary distrust of the English envoy. It lasted up to the\r\n17th of September; and ended as it began, in a fruitless debate about\r\nLord Malmesbury's powers to treat in full. In the meanwhile, the event\r\nknown by the name of the Revolution of Fructidor took place in Paris,\r\nthe meeting was broken up, and Lord Malmesbury left Lisle on the 18th of\r\nSeptember.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Cleveland Row, Sept. 20th, 1797.\r\n     MY DEAREST BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     Late last night we got a messenger from Lord Malmesbury, with an\r\n     account that he was ordered away from Lisle, and was on his way to\r\n     London, where he arrived this morning. It is not easy to say\r\n     beforehand what effects it will produce here, where people's\r\n     spirits are so susceptible of alarm and depression; but I really\r\n     think, in the manner of doing the thing, the Directory have done\r\n     everything they could to play our game.\r\n\r\n     The dissatisfaction will be great in France, but they seem, for the\r\n     moment, completely masters there. Ireland is our weakest point, and\r\n     to that our attention must be most directed; for anything else I\r\n     have very little apprehension.\r\n\r\n     I think it probable that the consequences of this new state of\r\n     things will be to detain me in and about town, and to put an end to\r\n     my hopes of a journey to Stowe or Wotton; but I am not yet quite\r\n     sure as to this. I hope we shall not be in a hurry to meet\r\n     Parliament, as I understand that it will not be necessary, in point\r\n     of finance, till about the middle of November. Between this and\r\n     that time many things may still happen to raise people's spirits,\r\n     which I should fear would in the present moment be much depressed,\r\n     whatever pains we took to raise them.\r\n\r\n     Ever, my dearest brother, most affectionately yours,\r\n     G.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1798.\r\n\r\nCONDITION OF ENGLAND--PLANS FOR THE NATIONAL DEFENCES--THE AUGMENTATION\r\nOF THE MILITIA--VOLUNTARY SUBSCRIPTIONS--A REBELLION BREAKS OUT IN\r\nIRELAND--LORD CORNWALLIS SUCCEEDS LORD CAMDEN AS LORD-LIEUTENANT--LORD\r\nBUCKINGHAM VOLUNTEERS FOR IRELAND--DIFFERENCES WITH LORD CORNWALLIS--MR.\r\nTHOMAS GRENVILLE IS APPOINTED ON A MISSION TO VIENNA AND BERLIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nA rebellion in Ireland, and a threat of invasion from France, for which\r\nactive preparations were making on the coast and in the Channel, almost\r\nexclusively absorbed the attention of Government at the beginning of the\r\nyear 1798, and demanded all the resources which the devotion of the\r\npeople could contribute to the protection of the country. The extremity\r\nof the public danger had the effect of uniting all classes in a combined\r\neffort for self-preservation; and the national enthusiasm was pronounced\r\nso strongly and unanimously on this point, that the heads of the\r\nOpposition, shattered and enfeebled, retired from the fruitless contest\r\nthey had been so long waging against the Administration, and left Mr.\r\nPitt and his colleagues in almost undisturbed possession of both Houses\r\nof Parliament.\r\n\r\nBut security was not to be purchased without great sacrifices. The\r\nexpenditure of the past year had amounted to the enormous sum of\r\ntwenty-five millions and a half; and Mr. Pitt found it necessary, in\r\norder to provide a supply equal to the emergencies of the future, to\r\nintroduce an entirely new system of finance. He proposed to triple the\r\namount of the existing assessed taxes, with a limitation, restraining\r\nthe maximum of taxation to the tenth of each person's income; and to\r\nborrow the remainder of what was required without creating any\r\nadditional debt, by appropriating the produce of the sinking fund.\r\n\r\nThere was a violent resistance in both Houses to this plan; Mr. Fox, Mr.\r\nSheridan, and others, who had previously seceded, re-appearing in their\r\nplaces for the express purpose of opposing it; but it was carried,\r\nnevertheless, by large majorities. Several other measures, to provide\r\nmeans for carrying on the war, and strengthening the national defences,\r\nwere also introduced; and at no period, since the commencement of\r\nhostilities, was public opinion declared so energetically in favour of\r\nthe ministerial policy. Numerous circumstances contributed to feed the\r\npopular ardour as the year advanced. Splendid naval victories inspired\r\nthe highest confidence in the ultimate issues of the war; commerce once\r\nmore resumed its former activity; the harvest was unusually abundant;\r\nand all branches of trade and industry reached a height of prosperity\r\nthat completely relieved the depression under which they had suffered\r\nduring the preceding year.\r\n\r\nThe most active measures were set on foot to promote the common object\r\nof protecting the empire against foreign invasion and domestic treason.\r\nThe most prominent of them was a plan for augmenting the Militia,\r\nafterwards matured and introduced by Mr. Dundas; and the collection of\r\nsubscriptions towards the formation of a national defence fund. No\r\ngreater proof could be given of the zeal of the people, at a period when\r\ntheir burthens were already so excessive, than the munificence and\r\npromptitude of their contributions on this occasion. At a meeting of\r\nbankers and merchants held in the open square of the Royal Exchange,\r\nupwards of forty-six thousand pounds were collected on the spot; the\r\nKing subscribed L20,000; the Queen L5,000; numerous mercantile firms and\r\nprivate individuals contributed large sums, varying from L3,000 to\r\nL10,000; and the Bank of England, the noble tribute of L200,000. That\r\nthis urgent necessity should have pressed heavily upon those public men\r\nwhose position made a heavy demand upon their patriotism, was to be\r\nexpected, and in some instances, sacrifices were made to an extent which\r\nrendered unavoidable the reduction of their domestic establishments; but\r\nno considerations of personal inconvenience were suffered to interfere\r\nwith the paramount claims of duty. The subjoined letters throw\r\nconsiderable light on these transactions, and are of especial interest\r\nfrom the minute details they present respecting the measures that were\r\nadopted in this great emergency for augmenting and organizing the\r\nMilitia force of the kingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Cleveland Row, Feb. 2nd, 1798.\r\n     MY DEAREST BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     I saw yesterday in Pitt's hands your letter to him. The sacrifice\r\n     you make is certainly very great, and such as I could not have\r\n     thought myself at liberty to advise, though I am glad on the whole\r\n     that your determination is such as it is; not that I am very much\r\n     attached (but quite the contrary) to the idea of raising public\r\n     supplies by voluntary contributions, and still less by\r\n     contributions _soi-disant_ voluntary, but in reality extorted by\r\n     popular clamour and prejudice. But after that business has been\r\n     carried as far as it has, it would have been too invidious for you\r\n     to have put yourself in a breach which I think ought never to have\r\n     been made. I am much concerned at what you say in your letter to\r\n     Pitt respecting the personal inconvenience to which this step will\r\n     subject you, and particularly as to the idea of your doing anything\r\n     that can look like an avowed intention of suspending your residence\r\n     at Stowe. It seems to me that nothing is more natural than that\r\n     this state of things should lead to reduction of your\r\n     establishments; and I believe in so doing you will only follow a\r\n     very general example, though I appear to be selected as a much more\r\n     striking instance of it than I have yet been able, with my best\r\n     endeavours, to make myself. It will also be very easy for you,\r\n     quartered in Essex, to be as much or as little as you please at\r\n     Stowe in the course of the year; but any avowal of quitting that\r\n     residence would, I think, do you a needless injury.\r\n\r\n     You will receive in a day or two the circular letter for calling\r\n     out the supplementary Militia, with the explanation of the manner\r\n     in which this is intended to be executed, so as to make it a\r\n     _muster_ of the whole, but an embodying only of a part.\r\n\r\n     War with America and Portugal seems quite determined on at Paris;\r\n     nor do I see how Denmark can keep herself out of the scrape,\r\n     though she will most certainly do her best. The general opinion is\r\n     that Mulin has established his superiority over Barras and\r\n     Buonaparte. There can be no doubt of the intention to invade us\r\n     here or in Ireland, or both.\r\n\r\n     The capture of the packet leaves us still without official or\r\n     direct accounts from the West Indies, but all the accounts we get\r\n     are favourable.\r\n\r\n     I enclose you, in confidence, a paper, which I think will be\r\n     interesting to you. You will be so good as _not to have seen_ it,\r\n     and to return it to me. It is of course to be kept under lock and\r\n     key. It is unpublished, and meant to remain so.\r\n\r\n     Ever most affectionately yours,\r\n     G.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. T. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Charles Street, April 27th, 1798.\r\n     MY DEAREST BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     It is only from your letter to William that I have learnt what is\r\n     the actual state of the discussion which you had begun upon the\r\n     subject of the flank companies of the Militia, and very sorry I am\r\n     to find that it is likely to take any shape which can be unpleasant\r\n     or disagreeable to you. The measure itself is one which I have\r\n     understood to be one of the few measures upon which, in point of\r\n     necessary military preparation, all our officers are agreed, and\r\n     which, if I recollect right, you yourself are as strongly inclined\r\n     to as anybody, though not precisely in the mode recommended by the\r\n     Commander-in-chief; if the objections which you felt on the point\r\n     of _Militia_ establishment had been equally felt and adopted by the\r\n     generality of the commanding officers of Militia, some way or other\r\n     must, I suppose, have been found to accommodate the difficulties of\r\n     such a representation; but in the present instance (as far as I\r\n     could collect from Fortescue, who was at a pretty numerous meeting\r\n     of all the Militia commanders who were in town), there was not any\r\n     one of those who did not express their readiness to adopt this\r\n     plan, and their approbation of it; so that, in fact, this matter,\r\n     so far from being taken up by the generality of commanding officers\r\n     in the same light in which you had objected to it, has really the\r\n     sanction of every commanding officer, except, as I am told, Lord\r\n     Berkeley, Lord Carnarvon and yourself.\r\n\r\n     Under these circumstances, much as I regret that any arrangement\r\n     could be proposed and could be likely to be carried, which is so\r\n     disagreeable to you, you will, however, I am sure, agree with me\r\n     that it stands upon very different ground, when it stands upon the\r\n     ground of individual opinions, from what it would have done if it\r\n     had been taken up by the whole or the majority or a large part of\r\n     the Militia. My best hopes are that some mode may yet be found\r\n     which may place your own regiment in the shape that you had wished;\r\n     and William has, I know, taken all the pains he can to urge the\r\n     adoption of all or of any of the modifications of this order, which\r\n     may make it less objectionable to you; and I cannot therefore but\r\n     hope that his zeal and anxiety in this will carry it to a better\r\n     shape for you as far as you are immediately interested. But we live\r\n     in times of such pressing public duty, and the military post to\r\n     which you are called and in which you are placed, is one so forward\r\n     both in danger and in honourable distinction to you, that I should\r\n     not do my duty by you if I did not (however uncalled upon for that\r\n     opinion) add that, in my poor judgment, no state of military\r\n     arrangements or orders can for a moment admit of the possibility of\r\n     your giving up your command in an hour of danger, as immediate as\r\n     that in which I write. I know you will give me credit for the\r\n     honesty of this opinion, as well as for the affection which calls\r\n     it forth from me.\r\n\r\n     God bless you, my dearest brother.\r\n     Ever most affectionately yours,\r\n     T. G.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Cleveland Row, April 27th, 1798.\r\n     MY DEAREST BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     On receiving your letter to Pitt, I sent it to him, and have since\r\n     seen him and Dundas. I understand from them that you have been\r\n     misinformed about the idea of their intending to bring in any new\r\n     Bill on the subject of forming the flank companies of Militia into\r\n     light infantry battalions, as the opinion both of the Attorney and\r\n     Solicitor-General is quite clear on the interpretation of the\r\n     present law. With respect to the measure itself, I must say that as\r\n     far as I understand it, my opinion is and always has been clearly\r\n     for it. But what is much more important is, that the Duke of York,\r\n     all the Generals of districts and Lord Cornwallis, the only\r\n     military Cabinet Minister, all put the salvation of the country\r\n     upon it. In this situation I do not think that Pitt, or Dundas, or\r\n     any of us, could take upon ourselves the responsibility of omitting\r\n     a measure, stated to be clearly within the law, and in which so\r\n     large a proportion of the Militia officers are disposed to\r\n     acquiesce with cordiality and cheerfulness.\r\n\r\n     Nothing certainly can be further from their wishes, even as public\r\n     men only, than to place you in any unpleasant or difficult\r\n     situation; but you will not think this a moment when points of real\r\n     importance can be given up to personal considerations of regard and\r\n     good-will.\r\n\r\n     It has occurred, that adopting the measure generally, the\r\n     application of it to your particular regiment might be avoided, by\r\n     permitting you to form a separate light infantry battalion, under\r\n     the command of Fremantle, he being an army officer, and one whom\r\n     the Duke of York himself allows to be as fit for that purpose as\r\n     any he could select; and that this permission may, under certain\r\n     circumstances and conditions, be extended to other colonels\r\n     desirous of taking that mode preferably to the other.\r\n\r\n     But this is not without its difficulty, nor is it possible for any\r\n     man, beforehand, to engage for the Duke of York's consent to a\r\n     measure, on which he has so much right not only to have _voix au\r\n     chapitre_ but to have a voice nearly decisive, so long as his\r\n     regulations do not interfere with the law. All, therefore, that I\r\n     can say is, that I am persuaded Dundas will do whatever he can to\r\n     promote this arrangement, the only solution that I see to\r\n     difficulties, one side of which, in the alternative stated by you,\r\n     present consequences to which I am very sure, whatever else\r\n     happens, you will never bring yourself to look. If I had the least\r\n     doubt upon that point, I certainly could and should say much of the\r\n     time, of the situation of the country, of the local position of\r\n     your regiment in its present quarters, and of the possibility of\r\n     any man, under such circumstances, resigning a command because he\r\n     disapproves in his own judgment, even supposing him right in that\r\n     judgment, of a military order which the Commander-in-chief has\r\n     clearly a right to give, and for the omission, as well as the\r\n     giving of which, he and the Government are exclusively responsible.\r\n\r\n     I know nothing more of the supplementary Militia than that they are\r\n     to be immediately called out.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Dropmore, May 1st, 1798.\r\n     MY DEAREST BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     I got your letter here last night. I should not have gone out of\r\n     town even for one day, if I had not understood from Dundas that the\r\n     Duke of York, though quite determined against adopting the\r\n     substitution you propose, seemed to think that in order to avoid\r\n     putting you under difficulties of any sort, he could forbear to\r\n     make the demand on your regiment.\r\n\r\n     I do not say that I like this expedient, but I see no other without\r\n     his abandoning a measure which, for one, I should be very sorry to\r\n     see abandoned, believing, as I do, that things of much more\r\n     importance than the matter of any legal question of a Militia Act,\r\n     depend upon it. I really believe that you are not accurately\r\n     informed when you speak of the wishes of the Militia in general\r\n     being against this measure. But on this point you have certainly\r\n     better means of knowing individual opinions than I can have. On the\r\n     legal point, the opinion of the King's law servants must of course\r\n     be the only guide for a Commander-in-chief, even if he were not a\r\n     Prince of the blood, but much more when he is so, and consequently\r\n     not supposed to enter into discussions of that sort, or to be\r\n     responsible for them.\r\n\r\n     I grieve that in these times you should set the example of raising\r\n     these questions; but I am confident you would not do so if you did\r\n     not think it right. I own I should have thought that any idea of\r\n     _disobeying, as a Militia officer_, a command of the\r\n     Commander-in-chief, was out of the question in the present moment,\r\n     and that if the case (I had almost said) which you yourself put,\r\n     had occurred, that of being ordered to embark on board Lord\r\n     Bridport's fleet, you would have done so, with a protest of _ne\r\n     trahatur in exemplum_.\r\n\r\n     Dundas will, as I understand from him, explain to you what he\r\n     considers to be the case about your letter, which he states to me\r\n     to have been an official letter addressed, I think, to P. W. Howe\r\n     or his Adjutant-General, and which therefore he did not consider in\r\n     any other light than as an accurate statement of the doubt given in\r\n     officially and meant to be so considered. But all this is of very\r\n     little consequence in comparison of that of the light in which the\r\n     thing itself places you, if it were possible that you could adopt\r\n     the resolution you speak of.\r\n\r\n     I take it for granted that Dundas's Bill is meant only to extend to\r\n     British subjects, or may easily be so limited. As such, it is\r\n     surely highly advantageous in the present moment to have the\r\n     services of the men who, of all British officers, have seen the\r\n     most real service.\r\n\r\n     I do not think that the Vienna news at all lessens the expediency\r\n     of calling out the remaining third of the Militia. It is highly\r\n     probable that the French, seeing that they cannot hope to contend\r\n     again with England and Austria joined together, may determine to\r\n     accelerate their attack on us, and put the whole on that one\r\n     desperate issue.\r\n\r\n     Ever, my dearest brother,\r\n     Most affectionately yours,\r\n     G.\r\n\r\nThe insurrection in Ireland was now approaching the moment which had\r\nbeen arranged by the rebels for the final move upon the capital. The\r\nwhole plan of the rising, which was to have taken place on the 23rd of\r\nMay, appeared in the details of a paper found upon the person of Lord\r\nEdward Fitzgerald, whose capture on the 19th frustrated the designs of\r\nthe infatuated conspirators. Measures of the most careful precaution had\r\nbeen previously taken by the Government. Sir Ralph Abercromby, who had\r\nbeen in command of the army, and expressed a wish to retire, was\r\nreplaced by General Lake, whose knowledge of the country afforded the\r\nstrongest assurance of success in the vigorous proceedings it became\r\nnecessary to adopt.\r\n\r\nThe presence of the military in the disturbed districts, and the\r\nnumerous seizures of arms and arrests of members of the provincial\r\ncommittees that were organized over the country, had considerably\r\nderanged the plans and weakened the resources of the confederacy\r\npreviously to the arrest of Lord Edward Fitzgerald, which effectually\r\ncrushed the hopes of the rebels, although for some months afterwards\r\nthey carried on a sort of flying campaign, with a desperation and\r\nferocity that constantly baffled the operations of the regular troops.\r\nLord Edward Fitzgerald died on the 3rd of June from the effects of the\r\nwounds he received in the frantic resistance he offered to the persons\r\nwho arrested him.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Cleveland Row, May 25th, 1798.\r\n     MY DEAREST BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     Accounts of a very satisfactory nature have been received here this\r\n     morning from Dublin. They were upon the very brink of an\r\n     insurrection, which was to have taken place on the 22nd. They had\r\n     intelligence of it, and by the arrest of Lord Edward Fitzgerald and\r\n     the two Sheares's, who were at the head of the plot, they have not\r\n     only disconcerted this plan, but have procured indisputable\r\n     evidence for proceeding against these traitors, and have now, I\r\n     trust, the certainty of convicting them. A special Commission is\r\n     preparing for the purpose of bringing them to trial as speedily as\r\n     possible, but it will require about a month before all the forms\r\n     can be got through. We are sending back O'Connor to them, and it is\r\n     probable that his trial may be included in the same Commission.\r\n\r\n     They write on the 21st, in the best possible spirits, from the\r\n     Castle. The attack was intended against Chapelizod, the magazine in\r\n     the Phoenix, and the Castle, at the same time; and in order to\r\n     increase the confusion, the houses of some of the leading people\r\n     were also to have been attacked, and the individuals, at the head\r\n     of whom of course was the Chancellor, were to be put to death. The\r\n     camp near Dublin was also to be assaulted.\r\n\r\n     In the desk of one of the Sheares's was found the proclamation\r\n     ready drawn, which was to be issued for the establishment of the\r\n     Republican Government.\r\n\r\n     A letter was written on the 21st, to the Lord Mayor of Dublin, by\r\n     Lord Castlereagh, to acquaint him with this design, and to order\r\n     him to make search for arms, &c., and a message was to be sent to\r\n     Parliament the 21st or 22nd. They are not quite sure that the idea\r\n     of the insurrection was abandoned, even after this blow-up; but\r\n     they were so completely on their guard, that there was nothing to\r\n     be apprehended.\r\n\r\n     You will have seen that Lord E. F. made a desperate resistance when\r\n     he was taken. It is, however, supposed that Ryan will recover,\r\n     though stabbed in the belly. They had already taken about two\r\n     thousand pikes in Dublin alone, and great numbers in the adjacent\r\n     counties. On the whole, I trust that with vigorous measures, such\r\n     as every one will feel this crisis requires, the seeds of the\r\n     rebellion will be crushed.\r\n\r\n     I think there are full grounds to proceed against Lord Thanet and\r\n     Co. for a conspiracy to rescue, as well as for the riot. O'Connor's\r\n     acquittal is imputed to Miller's charge, and _that_ to his being\r\n     completely exhausted, so as to omit some of the most material\r\n     points in the evidence.\r\n\r\n     Ever most affectionately yours,\r\n     G.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Cleveland Row, June 1st, 1798.\r\n     MY DEAREST BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     I did not answer your letter earlier, because I waited to know the\r\n     opinion of others on the subject of the proposal which you mention.\r\n     I find that there is a very strong apprehension of creating by it\r\n     dissatisfaction among the Militia, and of impeding the future\r\n     raising and augmentation of that force. For it is reasoned thus:\r\n     although in the present moment the public spirit is so high that it\r\n     is probable a very large part would readily concur in a similar\r\n     proposition, yet there would certainly be many individuals, and\r\n     perhaps some bodies among them, who would be reluctant to alter\r\n     their original terms of service. These persons would hardly be\r\n     placed in a fair situation, because although the option would still\r\n     nominally be left to them; yet that would be attended with so much\r\n     odium, and would so much carry the appearance of backwardness, that\r\n     any persons in such a time as this, and particularly persons\r\n     engaged in military service, would naturally be very unwilling to\r\n     expose themselves to it. By this means, all security and confidence\r\n     in the original terms of enlistment would be lost, and both\r\n     officers and men, deliberating about entering into the Militia,\r\n     would do it with the idea that they might continually be called\r\n     upon to serve out of the kingdom, which would destroy the whole\r\n     Militia system.\r\n\r\n     Besides this, another objection strikes me, which I think perhaps\r\n     even stronger than the preceding. It is that of the loss of\r\n     security to this country, both in point of fact and opinion, from\r\n     rendering that force applicable otherwise than to the immediate\r\n     protection of Great Britain. I hope that in all cases we should\r\n     have done our best, according to such judgment as we could form at\r\n     the time: but I will fairly own to you that I do not myself believe\r\n     that England would have been now as secure as I trust it is, if we\r\n     had possessed the power of disposing of the Militia regiments for\r\n     Channel or Irish service, and much less if that power had also been\r\n     extended to the continent in general.\r\n\r\n     A third argument I think of little weight, but I know from what I\r\n     have heard in general conversation on the subject, that it would\r\n     make considerable impression among a particular class of men. The\r\n     Militia is now raised by a sort of direct burthen on the landed\r\n     interest, who are reconciled to it from the apparent and visible\r\n     protection which their property derives from it. Whereas, if it was\r\n     applied to purposes of more general, though possibly greater,\r\n     public advantage, that would be called _unfair_ upon the counties,\r\n     as the term now is, and we should infallibly have proposals for\r\n     throwing the whole burthen, in all its various shapes, more equally\r\n     on the general mass of property within the kingdom.\r\n\r\n     For all these reasons, tempting as it would be in the present state\r\n     of the war, to avail ourselves of the service of that which\r\n     constitutes the greatest part of our regular force for the purpose\r\n     of those operations, with the necessity of which we are thoroughly\r\n     impressed, yet I really do not think, nor is it thought by others,\r\n     that we can prudently attempt it.\r\n\r\n     A more limited idea has occurred to me, in which I think your zeal\r\n     might be useful in the way of example. It is this. In any case of\r\n     invasion (which is by no means to be put out of the question,\r\n     however the public love to flatter themselves about it) I think it\r\n     is evident that there might, and probably would be, much boat\r\n     service. It is by no means impossible that, even in the very act of\r\n     landing, they might have to be opposed by gun-boats, _et id genus\r\n     omne_, and that troops would be wanted for that service. If landed,\r\n     and having taken Dumourier's \"_position on the coast_\" to wait for\r\n     reinforcements and provisions, perhaps the General who commands our\r\n     force in that quarter may wish to attack them from the sea, without\r\n     waiting for the certain arm of starvation which would be hanging\r\n     over them. The same principle applies to the defence of our tide\r\n     rivers, harbours, &c. Now, for all this, I should think it would be\r\n     highly useful that our troops should in some degree be trained to\r\n     this boat work, and though perhaps an inland regiment of Militia\r\n     might not be thought the best to begin with, yet by suggesting this\r\n     idea to Sir W. Howe, and expressing your readiness and that of your\r\n     regiment to lend yourselves to it, an example might be set to\r\n     others and a very useful practice introduced.\r\n\r\n     I wrote this early in the morning and before the arrival of the\r\n     post, so that I do not know whether there will be any accounts from\r\n     Dublin. If there are, I will add them before I close this letter.\r\n     Those of yesterday were, as I understood from the Duke of P. and\r\n     King, perfectly good, but I did not see them. The only thing that\r\n     appears at all distressing is that the communication with the south\r\n     was still interrupted, and although this may arise from the\r\n     disturbed state of any one point through which the roads pass, yet\r\n     it is productive of uneasiness, and may afford opportunities for\r\n     spreading alarms in the south, the consequences of which might be\r\n     very serious. No disturbance had shown itself in the north.\r\n\r\n     Buonaparte is gone to Toulon instead of Rastadt, and it is now\r\n     publicly declared at Paris that his object is Cadiz, Portugal, or\r\n     Ireland. If we are not more than commonly unfortunate, _il trouvera\r\n     a qui parler en chemin_.\r\n\r\n     I do not think Pitt could avoid answering Fremy's call, and as it\r\n     has turned out it is certainly better as it is. One shudders to\r\n     think what might have happened.\r\n\r\n     Ever most affectionately yours,\r\n     G.\r\n\r\n     I do not enclose the \"Gazette,\" because I conclude you have it.\r\n     There was nothing else of any importance from Ireland last night,\r\n     and nothing at all this morning.\r\n\r\nIn the month of June, Lord Cornwallis, upon whose military talents the\r\nCabinet placed great reliance, was appointed to succeed Lord Camden in\r\nthe government of Ireland; and the Irish Secretaryship was again offered\r\nto Mr. Thomas Grenville, and declined.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. T. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Aylesbury, June 11th, 1798.\r\n     MY DEAREST BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     By a letter from Cleveland Row which I have this moment received, I\r\n     find the Irish storm, which I told you I had seen gathering, is\r\n     likely to fall as I had expected it. It is settled that Lord\r\n     Cornwallis is to go Lord-Lieutenant, and in case of Pelham's\r\n     declining on account of his health, I see I shall be urged in the\r\n     strongest manner possible to fill his situation there. I have\r\n     already talked this matter so much over with you, and you know so\r\n     entirely, both my utter aversion to it, and my reluctance to\r\n     decline any personal risk or inconvenience in these critical times,\r\n     that I cannot on either side add anything upon this subject; but\r\n     upon a matter of so much anxiety and importance to me, a matter too\r\n     of which you are in every respect qualified to give me so good an\r\n     opinion, you will not be surprised at the solicitude which I\r\n     express to know all that you may think about it. Perhaps it may not\r\n     come in question, if Pelham is strong again and in health, but if\r\n     it does, as very possibly it may, I cannot enough say how desirous\r\n     I shall be to discuss the whole matter with you; and as time may\r\n     press in the instant of its being proposed, I know that you will\r\n     readily turn this in your mind in the present moment. I shall be in\r\n     town on Thursday, which being a fair day here, ends our eight days'\r\n     exercise; it has passed very prosperously, they do extremely well,\r\n     and have been from seventy to eighty out, and working every day\r\n     seven or eight hours. We go on to beat the rebels in Ireland, but\r\n     we beat them into soldiers.\r\n\r\n     God bless you, dearest brother.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Cleveland Row, June 13th, 1798.\r\n     MY DEAREST BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     I do not hear of any Irish news this morning; if there is any, I\r\n     will add it before I close this letter. I entirely agree with you\r\n     in thinking the situation of Irish Secretary to be in rank and\r\n     estimation much below Tom's calibre. In point of real utility and\r\n     scope for displaying the powers of his mind, God knows it is\r\n     difficult, extensive, and important enough for the talents of the\r\n     greatest man this country ever saw. It is, however, as you will\r\n     have learnt by my note of yesterday, out of the question; and\r\n     Pelham's rank is too much on a level with his, to admit of the idea\r\n     of interposing Tom or Lord D. between Lord C. and him.\r\n\r\n     When I wrote yesterday, I had not seen Nugent's letter, nor indeed\r\n     heard much of the particulars, as you will have seen from my\r\n     letter. I think nothing can be better than Nugent's conduct seems\r\n     to have been, and his letter is extremely manly, distinct and\r\n     judicious. But what a picture does it offer of our officers! I\r\n     believe I do not know _this_ Lumley; but I do not, as far as I\r\n     _have_ known them, think that there is one of the race fit to be\r\n     trusted with the command of a patrole of watchmen, from Lord\r\n     Scarborough downwards. Walpole I had long known, and certainly I\r\n     should have said the same of him. What a calamity it is, that our\r\n     army has not yet been taught that the command of troops in moments\r\n     of difficulty and danger requires skill and knowledge, and is not a\r\n     faculty bought with a commission at the regulated price.\r\n\r\n     _Je vois tres en noir_ about this Irish business; but with me that\r\n     feeling never has, I trust, operated otherwise than as an\r\n     incitement to greater exertion, \"to bate no jot of heart, or hope,\r\n     but still bear up, and steer right onward.\" We have gone through\r\n     such scenes as this country has never before known; where we have\r\n     been wanting in firmness, we have suffered for it; where we have\r\n     shown courage adequate to the danger, God has borne us through it;\r\n     and so I trust He will do. At all events, our lives, and honour,\r\n     and the existence of our country, are staked upon the issue, and\r\n     nothing but resolution can save us.\r\n\r\n     I saw with the greatest pleasure the address of your regiment. I am\r\n     happy it has taken that shape, because I think it the least\r\n     exceptionable, and still am inclined to the measure. If it\r\n     depended on my choice alone, I do not think many hours would pass\r\n     over before you would be in march.\r\n\r\n     It really looks as if Buonaparte was after all in sober truth going\r\n     to Egypt: and Dundas seems to think the scheme of attacking India\r\n     from thence not so impracticable as it may appear. I am still\r\n     incredulous as to the latter point, though as to the former I am\r\n     shaken. But as Buonaparte on the 23rd was still off Toulon, and as\r\n     Lord St. Vincent must have detached on the 21st at latest, there is\r\n     much reason to hope that Nelson may destroy all these visions, be\r\n     they what they may. From the coasts of Normandy and Brittany the\r\n     troops are in great part withdrawn--they do the Germans too much\r\n     honour!\r\n\r\n     Ever yours,\r\n     G.\r\n\r\nOne of the plans of Ministers (which appears to have originated with\r\nLord Buckingham) for inspiring confidence in Ireland, was to send over a\r\nfew regiments of English Militia, during the continuance of the\r\ndisturbances. Lord Buckingham was the first colonel of an English\r\nMilitia regiment that volunteered upon that service, and, remembering\r\nthe position he had on two former occasions occupied in Ireland, his\r\nexample in taking the lead on such an occasion was productive of the\r\nhappiest effects in awakening the zeal of others.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Cleveland Row, June 28th, 1798.\r\n     MY DEAREST BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     I this morning received your letter from Liverpool. I rejoice to\r\n     think that the Wexford news will probably make your stay at Dublin\r\n     of no long continuance, and much as I regret the present\r\n     inconvenience to yourself, yet I will own that it is gratifying to\r\n     me that this news did not arrive time enough to stop your\r\n     embarkation. I consider it as very important on many accounts that\r\n     some of the British Militia regiments should actually arrive in\r\n     Ireland, and I would not willingly forego the pride of knowing that\r\n     your regiment was the first of them. We have no news here of any\r\n     kind; indeed Ireland has engaged the whole attention of everybody\r\n     here, and left us no leisure to think of anything else except to\r\n     cast now and then a longing wish to the Mediterranean. We have, as\r\n     you will have heard from my brother, accounts of Nelson's being\r\n     actually in the Mediterranean, and such particulars as seem to\r\n     leave no doubt of his having been joined by the ten of the line and\r\n     the fifty under Trowbridge. I am more and more convinced that\r\n     Buonaparte's intention was only to proceed to Corsica and to wait\r\n     there the event of the negotiations, hanging upon the rear of\r\n     Naples and Tuscany, but without any other _present_ object, and\r\n     then to be determined by circumstances as to the future destination\r\n     of his fleet, for Portugal, Great Britain, Ireland, or the West\r\n     Indies. If we have tolerable luck, Nelson will disappoint all these\r\n     plans.\r\n\r\n     When you see Lord Clare, pray tell him that in consequence of his\r\n     having been spoken of by the Duke of Bedford and Lord Holland last\r\n     night in a manner extremely galling to my feelings, I took the\r\n     opportunity to express the sentiments which I believe he knows I\r\n     entertain of his character and conduct. This passed with the doors\r\n     of the House shut, so that he will not see any account of it in the\r\n     papers. He will not suppose that I claim any thanks for a bare act\r\n     of duty and justice, nor should I have wished it to be mentioned to\r\n     him from me, if I had not thought it just possible that he might\r\n     hear of the attack, in which case I should have felt much concern\r\n     if he had not at the same time known that it had been treated with\r\n     as much indignation and scorn as it merited.\r\n\r\n     The business of Williams is arranged to your wishes. I shall be\r\n     anxious to hear of your son after his arrival at Dublin, for I did\r\n     not think the account of his leg at all comfortable. If the Irish\r\n     news continues good, you will not, I think, have any other Militia\r\n     regiments besides those now there. We expect Lord Camden to-day.\r\n     Lord Darnley made a useful speech last night, in which he told us,\r\n     amongst other things, that he had never witnessed so much\r\n     satisfaction from any event at Dublin, as from the destruction of\r\n     Lord Moira's town. Lord M. was not there, and kept the Prince of\r\n     Wales away.\r\n\r\n     Ever most affectionately yours,\r\n     G.\r\n\r\nLord Buckingham arrived in Dublin towards the end of June, to the\r\ninfinite satisfaction of Lord Cornwallis, who found himself surrounded\r\nby the usual perplexities of Irish Government, considerably increased by\r\nthe excited condition of the country.\r\n\r\nThe general opinion entertained in England of the change that had\r\nrecently taken place in the character of the Irish insurrection, may be\r\ngathered from a passage in a letter addressed to Lord Buckingham by Mr.\r\nThomas Grenville, on the 5th of July.\r\n\r\n     As far as I can judge from the public accounts in the newspapers,\r\n     the rebellion seems rather to have changed its shape than to have\r\n     abandoned its object, and it may be a question whether much\r\n     advantage is gained in its becoming a Maroon war of plunderers and\r\n     banditti, rather than continuing to be a formal array regularly\r\n     opposed to the regular army in the country; because though it may\r\n     be true that the danger of a large army of rebels may be a danger\r\n     of greater magnitude, as well as more immediate, yet it furnishes\r\n     at least the opportunity of meeting that danger, and of grappling\r\n     with it; whereas this plundering, robbing, and burning war,\r\n     carried on by an infinite number of small parties, associated\r\n     together and hiding together like the thieves in the cave of Gil\r\n     Blas, puts the peace and the security of the country in greater\r\n     danger, keeps up a more constant alarm, is more difficult to\r\n     resist, because it is more difficult to find and to prepare\r\n     against, and, what is not the least consideration, it utterly ruins\r\n     and destroys the hopes of these men, after indulging long in such\r\n     habits, returning again either to labour or even to subordination.\r\n\r\n     To me, therefore, I own it seems to be more necessary than ever to\r\n     make the most active exertions in order to counteract this new\r\n     shape of evil; and I do hope and trust that, however ungracious and\r\n     mortifying it may be to military habits and military education to\r\n     be opposed to what may be deemed petty bands of robbers and\r\n     incendiaries, Lord Cornwallis will feel the necessity of applying\r\n     his best military talents in a service where no military glory can\r\n     be obtained, except as it may be applied to the restoration of the\r\n     security and tranquillity of the country.\r\n\r\nThe forbearance of Lord Cornwallis is alluded to in a subsequent letter\r\nfrom Lord Grenville. It was felt that his lenity in treating with the\r\nrebels was misplaced, and that the Government ought to have adopted a\r\nmore decided course in extinguishing the dying embers of the\r\ninsurrection.\r\n\r\n     I do not know how to trust my own judgment upon the very small\r\n     lights which (_entre nous_) Lord C. gives us as to what he is doing\r\n     in Ireland. But as far as I can judge, he is proceeding very fast\r\n     indeed, particularly when he allows rebels to stipulate for the\r\n     point of honour of not naming their confederates, and thereby\r\n     accepts a fresh act of misprision of treason, as a satisfaction for\r\n     former acts of treason. But this of course is only to you. The\r\n     great point I wish to be assured of, _if I could_, is that he has\r\n     not suffered a nearer view of difficulties to discourage him from\r\n     the pursuit of the only measure which can make it signify one\r\n     farthing what he does in the present moment. Let him carry that,\r\n     and I will willingly compromise for all the rest.\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd of August the long-threatened French invasion took place in\r\na shape that covered the expedition with universal ridicule. A handful\r\nof men, to the number of eight hundred, landed at Killala, and were\r\njoined by the rebels; and when they were attacked by General Lake a few\r\ndays afterwards, the whole force surrendered at discretion. This\r\nincident formed a striking contrast to the progress of the French in\r\nother directions, for at the very time when they were suffering this\r\nhumiliation in Ireland, their victorious arms were completing the\r\nsubjugation of Switzerland.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Dropmore, August 27th, 1798.\r\n     MY DEAREST BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     I am much obliged to you for your letter, which I got last night,\r\n     with the other accounts of the landing at Killala. I hope we are\r\n     not too sanguine in thinking that the French are much too late for\r\n     their object, and that the result of this expedition will give us\r\n     fresh security. The interval is however unavoidably one of some\r\n     anxiety, and I confess I regret now Lord Cornwallis's security in\r\n     declining to receive any further reinforcements, though it is\r\n     seldom that a General fails _on that side_. All this can only be\r\n     with a view to the possibility of a general insurrection; for\r\n     without that their twelve hundred men are not worth a second\r\n     thought, and their arms are merely thrown away.\r\n\r\n     I see in their full force all the difficulties that might arise in\r\n     the contingency of Lord Cornwallis's death. But I trust that danger\r\n     is as remote as the death of any man can reasonably be said to be.\r\n     There would be much inconvenience in its being suspected or known\r\n     that he had a provisional successor named and resident on the spot,\r\n     because Irish speculation would extend the contingency thus\r\n     provided for, from the case of his death to that of his\r\n     resignation. The subject shall however be considered, and your name\r\n     shall certainly not be brought forward unless I see that the thing\r\n     would be wished; the only footing on which it is possible to place\r\n     so liberal and generous an offer.\r\n\r\n     God bless you.\r\n\r\n     No more news of Buonaparte or Nelson. I terribly fear that the\r\n     latter will do something _too_ desperate.\r\n\r\n     Austria and Russia are evidently, _at last_, preparing for war. But\r\n     we are now in the end of August, and with a very little more\r\n     hesitation and delay the possibility of acting this year is gone,\r\n     and then France _must_ use the _winter_ to divide us all by\r\n     separate negotiations.\r\n\r\nIn a subsequent letter, Lord Grenville again refers to the policy acted\r\nupon by Lord Cornwallis in reference to the rebels.\r\n\r\n     With respect to the political system I had my doubts, and expressed\r\n     them to you, at the time that your opinions, formed I am sure every\r\n     way on much better means of judging than I have, was more\r\n     favourable to what was doing. But the experience is now, I am sorry\r\n     to say it, wholly on my side, and I am every hour more and more\r\n     persuaded that the old rules are best, and that Government has not\r\n     gained, but lose extremely, by allowing traitors to treat with them\r\n     in a body, and to stipulate for the right to commit a fresh and\r\n     distinct act of misprision of treason, for which they are at this\r\n     time indictable, till this new offence is protected with the old\r\n     ones by a Bill of pardon.\r\n\r\n     The situation of the Secretary, who is afraid to act on his opinion\r\n     in a great parliamentary question, is neither respectable nor\r\n     useful; but I protest that I am not more a stranger to Buonaparte's\r\n     government of Egypt than I am to that of Ireland. It cannot\r\n     continue in this state; but unfortunately, in these times it is not\r\n     enough to see that a thing is wrong, but one must be sure that in\r\n     endeavouring to correct it we do not produce some fresh and greater\r\n     mischief. It is a bad subject, and _fait faire du mauvais sang_.\r\n\r\n     My flock is more docile, and my Emperors are going to war like good\r\n     boys, but they have been a long while bringing themselves to it.\r\n\r\nThe excellent effect produced by the presence of the English Militia in\r\nIreland, led Lord Grenville to desire the extension of a service which,\r\nin many points of view, was admirably calculated to check the\r\ninsubordinate temper of the people. The English character offered an\r\nexample of steadiness and discipline which could hardly fail to make\r\nsome impression on the disordered masses of the population; while the\r\nindependence of all local interests and sectarian prejudices displayed\r\nby those troops might be reasonably hoped to exercise a beneficial\r\ninfluence on the minds of dispassionate people. Lord Cornwallis,\r\nhowever, held a different opinion; but he was so chary in his\r\ncommunications to the Cabinet, that we find Lord Grenville constantly\r\ncomplaining of not receiving any intelligence from the Castle, either as\r\nto the views of the Government or the events that were passing in the\r\ncountry. \"You will easily imagine,\" he observes in a letter to Lord\r\nBuckingham, \"I still feel some anxiety for further information, when I\r\ntell you that neither from Lord-Lieutenant nor Secretary have we, by\r\nthis messenger, one word more than you will see in the 'Gazette'\r\npublished this day. This system must have its end.\" The zeal of the\r\nEnglish Militia was not likely to be much encouraged by the plan of\r\nclose councils and sudden resolves thus pursued by Lord Cornwallis, and\r\nwhich, excellent, perhaps, in reference to regular troops, was\r\ncalculated to produce resentments and discontents amongst voluntary and\r\ntemporary levies. An unfortunate misunderstanding which occurred at this\r\ntime between Lord Cornwallis and Lord Buckingham developed the state of\r\nfeeling existing between the Irish Government and the English Militia,\r\nand brought it to a very unexpected crisis.\r\n\r\nA detachment of the Bucks had been ordered by the Lord-Lieutenant into\r\nthe field, and Lord Buckingham, as colonel of the regiment, conceived\r\nthat he had a right to take the command; but Lord Cornwallis, who looked\r\nat these matters with the formality and decision of a martinet,\r\nexercised his own discretion in giving the command to another officer.\r\nThe grounds of Lord Buckingham's exception to the Lord-Lieutenant's\r\ndictum on this point were, that the detachment taken from his regiment\r\nfor this particular service was numerically greater than the remainder\r\nof the regiment left behind, and that being also of greater force than a\r\ndetachment from another regiment with which it was to act, he was\r\nentitled to take the command of both. Lord Cornwallis, however,\r\noverruled his wishes, as tending to produce inconvenience to the service\r\nin the matter of rank, and in other respects. To Lord Buckingham's\r\nremonstrance on the subject, Lord Cornwallis transmitted a reply which\r\ninduced Lord Buckingham to request his Lordship's permission to lay the\r\nwhole correspondence before the King. It was to be expected under these\r\nfeelings of irritation that Lord Buckingham should have been desirous of\r\nreturning to England. But the expression of such a desire was liable to\r\nmisconstruction. Lord Grenville felt that it was possible it might be\r\ninterpreted into an appearance of declining service.\r\n\r\n     Now, my dear brother, as to the question of sending the Bucks back,\r\n     I really scarce know what to do about it. I have no communications\r\n     (for none of us have any) which can enable one to form the least\r\n     guess of Lord Cornwallis's intentions, much less any previous\r\n     knowledge of his measures. Nothing could be more unexpected to me\r\n     than to hear that he had ordered back any part of the Militia\r\n     force, which can alone enable him to accomplish his object, or to\r\n     protect Ireland during the winter. If any part is to go back, it\r\n     certainly seems reasonable that those who went first should be\r\n     first relieved; but I am totally at a loss how to take any steps\r\n     for this purpose which shall not be liable to interpretations the\r\n     most repugnant to your feelings and to the spirit with which you\r\n     set the example of a measure by which alone Ireland was to be\r\n     preserved to this country.\r\n\r\n     In a state of unreserved communication, such as ought to prevail\r\n     between a Lord-Lieutenant and his employers, or with a Secretary to\r\n     whom one might speak openly, and put such a point on its true\r\n     bearing, there would be no difficulty; but you know how far we are\r\n     from such a situation. Nor can I honestly advise the taking any\r\n     steps towards the removal of any part of the British Militia from\r\n     Ireland; though if any is to come away contrary to my opinion, I\r\n     feel and acknowledge the justice of your claim, and should, for\r\n     every personal reason to yourself, be most anxious to contribute\r\n     towards relieving you from such a scene. But even then, how to make\r\n     the application, and urge the claim without putting it into his\r\n     power to say that there is an appearance of declining service, I\r\n     know not, and yet I much wish to manage it. I have made an indirect\r\n     suggestion, in the hope that it may be conveyed to him, of the\r\n     propriety of considering (if any come away) how the choice should\r\n     be made; but I cannot answer for it that this will be stated to\r\n     him, and still less that he will pay any attention to it; and I am\r\n     restrained by the very forcible consideration I have already\r\n     mentioned, from taking more direct and active steps.\r\n\r\nLord Castlereagh was now appointed to the Secretaryship in Ireland, and\r\nthe question of the Union, which had been for some time under the\r\nconsideration of Government, began to shape itself into a practical\r\nform. We have here the first rough outline of the views of Ministers\r\nupon that measure.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Dropmore, Nov. 5th, 1798.\r\n     MY DEAREST BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     I am extremely obliged to you for your constant and kind letters,\r\n     which supply the vacancy of all other information. You will\r\n     perhaps know before you receive this, that after having employed\r\n     Pitt, and through him, me, and also General Ross, separately, to\r\n     press Tom to accept the thankless office of his Secretary, Lord\r\n     Cornwallis has, without one word of communication to him, written\r\n     to say that, Pelham declining, he desires to have Lord Castlereagh.\r\n     It is of a piece with all the rest! Pelham _has_ declined, and so\r\n     the whole thing will go on exactly as it does now. Yet, lamenting\r\n     this most sincerely on public grounds, I cannot but rejoice that\r\n     Tom is not to be embarked _dans cette maudite galere_. For what\r\n     satisfaction or honour could he receive from it? If he had gone at\r\n     first, he might have acquired and exercised some influence over his\r\n     principal, and God knows that could not but have turned to good.\r\n     But now the _pli_ is taken, the system is set up, and what can\r\n     alter it I know not. With respect to Lord Castlereagh, I have\r\n     always heard him spoken of as a man of parts and character; but he\r\n     cannot have, with Lord Cornwallis, or with the public, the weight\r\n     which his peculiar situation requires.\r\n\r\n     You will easily do me justice enough to believe that I am not blind\r\n     to the difficulties which all this heaps on the object (already\r\n     sufficiently difficult) which we have in view. I have had no\r\n     opportunity (and I am vexed at it) to discuss this subject in\r\n     private with Lord Clare. He was to have come here in his way to\r\n     Ireland, but he now writes me word that his letters from Ireland\r\n     are so pressing for his immediate return that he cannot lose a day.\r\n     I can well enough understand that his absence dissolves the little\r\n     government that did exist; but I fear, from what Pitt tells me, he\r\n     has not spoken out to him, nor would probably to me, as to the real\r\n     state of affairs there. I am assured that he talks not only\r\n     decisively of the necessity, but also _very sanguinely_ of the\r\n     success of our measure, provided always that no attempt is made to\r\n     change, as a part of the Union, the existing laws about the\r\n     Catholics. And in this last point I am very much disposed to agree\r\n     with him now, though before the rebellion I should have thought\r\n     differently. For, the doing this thing as a part of the present\r\n     measure, would be to hold out an encouragement to rebellion,\r\n     instead of showing that every endeavour to disunite Great Britain\r\n     and Ireland only makes them \"cling close and closer\" to each other.\r\n\r\n     I send you the sketch of our ideas--beyond that, I am sorry to say\r\n     we have not yet proceeded, though time presses so much. Many points\r\n     of detail will obviously arise from the discussion of these general\r\n     ideas, but who is to discuss them if the Lord-Lieutenant is afraid\r\n     to communicate with anybody? Forster has been written to twice, to\r\n     come over here; he holds back, but will I suppose now come, and\r\n     means will easily be found of having _that_ said to him which may\r\n     be necessary, whatever it may be.\r\n\r\n     One great doubt in my mind has been the mode of bringing the thing\r\n     into regular shape. In the case of two really independent kingdoms,\r\n     like England and Scotland, an union was as much matter of treaty as\r\n     an alliance between either of them and Austria and Prussia, but\r\n     here the kingdoms are inseparably annexed to each other, and the\r\n     legislatures only are independent. The King cannot, therefore, by\r\n     commission or full powers, authorize two sets of his subjects to\r\n     treat with each other concerning the mode in which he shall\r\n     hereafter govern his two kingdoms.\r\n\r\n     The manner in which _the Irish propositions_, as they were called,\r\n     were brought forward in 1785, was in my mind the most objectionable\r\n     part of that whole measure, and that which most contributed to its\r\n     failure. The scheme which has occurred to me in the present\r\n     instance is that the King should, by Order in Council in each\r\n     kingdom, refer it to a Committee of Council in each, to consider of\r\n     the means of an union, referring to them at the same time some\r\n     general sketch like that which I now enclose to you, or possibly a\r\n     little more detailed. Towards the conclusion of the business, it\r\n     might perhaps be necessary that the King should order a part of his\r\n     Irish Committee of Council to come over to confer with the British\r\n     Committee on any points of difficulty; and if at last the two\r\n     Committees can be brought to agree on one plan, _that_ might by the\r\n     King be submitted to the consideration of Parliament in both\r\n     kingdoms, and then passed all together, in one Bill, as in the case\r\n     of the Scotch Union.\r\n\r\n     You will observe in this plan which I now send, the particular care\r\n     taken not to alter the present rights of election, nor to give into\r\n     any theory of uniting small boroughs into sets, and leaving cities\r\n     as at present, in order to equalize, as it is called, the\r\n     representation of Ireland. This I consider as the corner-stone of\r\n     the whole building. If once we touch this, Parliamentary Reform\r\n     rushes in upon us here and in Ireland; and, as my friend Condorcet\r\n     said, \"from thence to the establishment of a complete republic, the\r\n     transition will be short indeed.\"\r\n\r\n     In better times, if we lived in them, I could certainly arrange\r\n     this matter more according to my own fancy; and there is nobody who\r\n     could not make to himself some theory on this subject, the very\r\n     framing of which is an amusing occupation of the mind, and for\r\n     which it then acquires a parental fondness. But now, if ever, and\r\n     here if in any matter, _stare super vias antiguas_ is the only\r\n     salvation to this country.\r\n\r\n     The idea of the French tariff I consider as very luminous and\r\n     happy. It was suggested by Cooke, but possibly he may not like that\r\n     it should be known, either to his principal or to the public, that\r\n     he is in the course of offering such suggestions.\r\n\r\n     You will not complain at least of the shortness of _this_ letter. I\r\n     sent you no bulletin about transports in Alexandria, because, I am\r\n     sorry to say, I do not believe one word of the report, but am\r\n     persuaded that it will turn out to be nothing more than the\r\n     destroying a gun-boat or two, the account of which we received and\r\n     published long ago. I am, however, totally without letters from\r\n     Eden by the last mail, from which I conclude that he has, _for\r\n     expedition's sake_, sent a messenger with his letters, who will\r\n     some time or another arrive. But there are many occasions of\r\n     sending a messenger besides this news. It does seem likely that\r\n     Malta will itself drive out the French. What a wonderful change in\r\n     twelve months!\r\n\r\n     God bless you.\r\n\r\nThe affairs of the continent, which had undergone latterly some\r\nconsiderable alterations, appearing to open a favourable opportunity for\r\nlaying the foundation of a new confederation against France, Mr. Thomas\r\nGrenville was charged with a mission to undertake negotiations for that\r\npurpose. His destination was Vienna and Berlin, with a roving commission\r\nsubject to circumstances. The rash and impolitic ambition of France had\r\nawakened an angry resistance on the part of Austria, who had recently\r\nentered into an alliance with the Court of St. Petersburg; and England,\r\ndesiring to avail herself of these events, employed Mr. Grenville to\r\nascertain the views of Prussia and Austria with reference to the\r\nformation of a general combination against the common enemy. \"He will\r\nhave, if I mistake not,\" observes Lord Grenville, \"very much the glory\r\nof signing the overthrow of Jacobin France.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. T. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Charles Street, Nov. 16th, 1798.\r\n     MY DEAREST BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     I had yesterday a long conversation with Lord G., who assured me\r\n     that his friend here had continued to the present moment to\r\n     express the same wish with respect to my destination, as he had at\r\n     first conveyed in the month of June last; but that a strong wish\r\n     being expressed on your side of the water for the present shape,\r\n     the great man here had thought it necessary to give way to the\r\n     great man there. Be this, however, as it may, he continued to state\r\n     so strongly the conviction of his own mind, and that of his\r\n     colleagues, to be that I could do a service in foreign mission\r\n     highly important to do, and with greater probability of success\r\n     than any other man, he appealed so directly to that sense of duty\r\n     which I had always announced as governing my conduct against even\r\n     the course of my own inclinations, that I told him, much as I\r\n     thought I had reason to complain, I would still be faithful to the\r\n     sense of duty to which he appealed; and upon his assurances, that\r\n     his colleagues felt as strongly as himself the importance of my\r\n     giving way to their wishes, I agreed to do whatever came within the\r\n     description of real or important service.\r\n\r\n     The general view of that service I cannot better describe to you in\r\n     large, than by saying that my local situation must be governed by\r\n     the circumstances of the time; but wherever I may be, my business\r\n     will be to arrange a better understanding among the powers of the\r\n     continent than has hitherto been found in them. It is again upon\r\n     this subject that I have more than ever to regret our separation,\r\n     because you will easily see how much of a subject like the present\r\n     I should anxiously wish to talk confidentially over with you, that\r\n     it would yet be impossible for me to put upon paper in the shape of\r\n     a letter; but in this short description you will see at once the\r\n     importance of the subject, and your readiness in all business will\r\n     easily suggest to you the numberless difficulties which are likely\r\n     to attach upon this. To those difficulties I am not blind; but it\r\n     is because they are felt to be such, that I think it my duty to\r\n     engage in them, and in that sentiment I am sure to have your\r\n     concurrence.\r\n\r\n     With respect to Mr. Fisher, you will easily see that for such a\r\n     situation I shall want the assistance which I have understood from\r\n     you he is well qualified and well disposed to give; I dare say,\r\n     therefore, that you will advise and recommend to me, to make this\r\n     proposal to him; and yet, till I have again seen Lord Grenville, to\r\n     know upon what footing of expense this stands, I do not know what I\r\n     can afford to offer to him, nor how far the situation of Envoy\r\n     Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary will, in point of pay,\r\n     furnish what Mr. Fisher ought to have; I will write again as soon\r\n     as I am better informed, for I apprehend that there will not be\r\n     much time to lose.\r\n\r\n     I think with you, that Tone's business has been awkwardly bothered.\r\n     I met Lord G. and Mr. P. this morning in the park; and was glad to\r\n     show them your letter, to give them the information, with your own\r\n     comments upon this strange jumble so unnecessarily produced. Do not\r\n     make any proposal to Fisher till you hear again from me. Can he\r\n     cypher? Does he understand German, &c.? I suppose, by your\r\n     recommending him, he does. My chief doubt is the insufficiency of\r\n     pay, and the impossibility of holding out future expectation\r\n     whatever. My route will probably be Berlin in about a fortnight;\r\n     but nothing can be more uncertain than my stay.\r\n\r\n     God bless you, dearest brother.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. T. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Charles Street, November 19th, 1798.\r\n     MY DEAREST BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     I have been anxious, as you will naturally suppose, to lose no time\r\n     in making such arrangements as may in any shape assist a situation\r\n     so little to my taste, and so repeatedly refused by me, till it was\r\n     put in such a shape of duty, as neither my opinions nor yours could\r\n     allow me to put by. I have therefore pressed for information on the\r\n     subject of Mr. Fisher, and wish to take the earliest opportunity of\r\n     stating to you how that matter stands. My mission will be a special\r\n     mission to Berlin and Vienna, and William is desirous of putting it\r\n     upon the footing and establishment of Ambassador in Ordinary,\r\n     though with the rank only of Envoy Extraordinary and Minister\r\n     Plenipotentiary, and with that of Privy Councillor; for I\r\n     understood that this last high honour will facilitate the means of\r\n     increasing the establishment of Envoy Extraordinary and Minister\r\n     Plenipotentiary to that of Ambassador in Ordinary. If this meets\r\n     with no difficulty, he hopes likewise, upon inquiry, to find\r\n     himself justified in allowing me a private secretary, at something\r\n     less than that of a Secretary of Legation, which is a guinea per\r\n     day. With this general description, therefore, I immediately\r\n     acquaint you, and hope you will think its outline tempting enough\r\n     to Mr. Fisher to engage him to come immediately, although I cannot\r\n     yet name the specific sum to be allowed to him. I must, however,\r\n     add that William has urged me in the strongest manner to hold out\r\n     to Mr. Fisher no expectation of farther remuneration or promotion\r\n     in consequence of this employment; not only because officially he\r\n     never admits any such claim of a private secretary, but also\r\n     because, by the many foreign appointments lost in the present state\r\n     of Europe, he is overloaded with claims of promotion, so as to\r\n     leave him no such means whatever. I think it fair to state this as\r\n     strongly as it was told me; but, as in your former letter you had\r\n     expressed Mr. Fisher's readiness to come to me _without any\r\n     expectation of farther remuneration_, I am still inclined to think\r\n     that I may depend upon this arrangement as made, and trust to you\r\n     for obtaining immediate leave of absence for him in Ireland; I say\r\n     _immediate_, because I apprehend that my stay in England cannot\r\n     possibly exceed a fortnight from to-day, though I cannot well be\r\n     prepared much under that time.\r\n\r\n     Of course, you will suppose me to be very impatient for Mr.\r\n     Fisher's arrival; and I trust he will lose no time, but will let me\r\n     see him in London as soon after you receive this letter as he\r\n     conveniently can. I cannot describe the probable duration of my\r\n     absence, it may be three months, or twelve, or more or less; but it\r\n     is too uncertain to leave me any fixed opinion even in my own mind.\r\n     Lord Elgin goes to Constantinople, where he will find Sir Sydney,\r\n     Koehler, &c. &c.\r\n\r\n     There is no foreign news whatever by the last mail; but many\r\n     accounts are come in of great loss on both sides, both insurgents\r\n     and the republican troops in Flanders; and the country is in such a\r\n     state, that the six last mails from France have not yet reached\r\n     Rotterdam.\r\n\r\n     A strong report prevails of Guadaloupe having given itself to the\r\n     English. It is believed in the city, on the credit of a Danish\r\n     ship, arrived from St. Thomas at Portsmouth; and I think they are\r\n     disposed to believe it at the Admiralty, though they have no\r\n     official account of it.\r\n\r\n     Our idea in London is, that all Irish courts-martial proceeding on\r\n     martial law will be suspended till this question is decided; my own\r\n     opinion is, that if the courts of law can safely sit, the courts of\r\n     martial law cannot exist at the same time. These latter seem to me\r\n     to grow only out of such a disturbed state of things as will not\r\n     allow of the due administration of justice by the regular course of\r\n     law, and therefore that for a time military government must for the\r\n     common safety stand in lieu of the courts of law; but to allow the\r\n     courts of law to resume their functions, is, in itself, as it\r\n     strikes me, a notice of the cessation of martial law; they cannot\r\n     go on together _inter arma silent leges_.\r\n\r\n     It is expected that Fox and his friends will continue to secede;\r\n     and Tierney support the Address, abuse O'Connor, and attack\r\n     Government only on this last event in Ireland. Pray write to me by\r\n     return of post. I presume I may depend on Mr. Fisher, and therefore\r\n     that I am secure in waiting for him.\r\n\r\n     No news yet of the 'Melpomene.'\r\n\r\n     God bless you, my dearest brother.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Cleveland Row, Dec. 11th, 1798.\r\n     MY DEAREST BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     I have this morning received your letter; and to the first\r\n     paragraph of it I will only say that I am too much accustomed to\r\n     your kindness to be surprised at this fresh instance of it. Be\r\n     assured that I feel it as I ought.\r\n\r\n     Tom will, I think, set out to-morrow, though it is in truth useless\r\n     for him to leave town while this east wind blows in the teeth of\r\n     all our projects. He will have a more difficult task to accomplish\r\n     than I once thought, particularly on account of a new intrigue that\r\n     has just sprung up at Berlin, as if on purpose to cross or thwart\r\n     our plans. Still, however, I persuade myself that all will\r\n     ultimately go right, and I am confident that he will do whatever\r\n     can be done.\r\n\r\n     If no more solid arguments are opposed to the Union than those of\r\n     Mr. Wild, we shall have at least the victory in disputation, though\r\n     in point of violence and inflammation he will, to be sure, not be\r\n     easily surpassed. The part which you say the Catholics are disposed\r\n     to take is undoubtedly very important; but does this mean only\r\n     their leaders, who do _not_ lead them, or has this opinion been\r\n     spread among the parish priests and lower orders? Certainly, if\r\n     they knew their interest, those descriptions ought to be peculiarly\r\n     favourable to it, for they will come under the especial protection\r\n     of the mildest and most equitable government upon the earth. But do\r\n     they see and feel this, and are any pains taken to impress them\r\n     with it? Forster's language continues to be very hostile, and I\r\n     imagine he thinks the Government will be frightened out of the\r\n     measure. The appointment of Commissioners seems, on the whole, to\r\n     be unavoidable, and the Acts for that purpose should, I think, be\r\n     proposed on the same day to both Parliaments.\r\n\r\n     Much objection seems to be taken to any Committee or other body of\r\n     that sort resident in Ireland; and perhaps the novelty in our\r\n     Constitution of Members of Parliament who cannot attend Parliament\r\n     is a solid objection to it. Would it not be easier to make the\r\n     representation consist of thirty county members, eight or ten city\r\n     members chosen from Dublin, Cork, &c., and the remainder elected by\r\n     alternate choice from classes of four boroughs each? What I mean is\r\n     not that the four in each class should choose altogether by\r\n     delegates, &c., but that the choice should be in one of them for\r\n     each Parliament, and this rotation settled at first by lot, and\r\n     then to continue unalterable. If this will not do, we must then\r\n     class them and choose by delegates, as in the Scotch precedent. But\r\n     who shall regulate this classing? and how conciliate the jarring\r\n     interests of great men?\r\n\r\n     By the way, you got me into something of a scrape by giving Cooke a\r\n     copy of the queries in the margin of the paper I sent you. I\r\n     omitted to give you any caution on this subject, because I thought\r\n     it was quite safe that you would not communicate it, and you\r\n     probably thought that the communication was very unimportant and\r\n     indifferent. It happened otherwise, but do not say anything to\r\n     Cooke about it.\r\n\r\n     You see the French papers confirm our hopes of Minorca. The\r\n     Russians and Turks have begun their operations against the\r\n     _department of the Egean Sea_, and have taken Cephalonia, I\r\n     believe Zante. I expect to hear very soon of the attack of\r\n     Alexandria by the Turks.\r\n\r\n     Ever yours,\r\n     G.\r\n\r\n     Dec. 12.\r\n\r\n     By a mistake this was omitted to be sent to you yesterday. No mails\r\n     in to-day, nor anything new of any kind. By the newspaper accounts,\r\n     Canning seems to have made an admirable speech yesterday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1799.\r\n\r\nENGLAND ENTERS INTO A TREATY WITH RUSSIA AGAINST FRANCE--MR. THOMAS\r\nGRENVILLE'S MISSION TO THE CONTINENT--THE UNION BETWEEN GREAT BRITAIN\r\nAND IRELAND--SUSPENSE RESPECTING THE FATE OF MR. GRENVILLE--PROGRESS OF\r\nEVENTS ON THE CONTINENT--AUSTRIA JOINS THE COALITION--VACILLATIONS AND\r\nINACTIVITY OF PRUSSIA--EXPEDITION TO HOLLAND--FURTHER AUGMENTATION OF\r\nTHE MILITIA--PROJECTS FOR THE ENSUING YEAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of December, 1798, a provisional treaty had been\r\nentered into between Russia and England, by which the Emperor bound\r\nhimself, on condition of a monthly subsidy from Great Britain, to have a\r\ncontingent of forty-five thousand men ready for the field, whenever the\r\ncommon cause should require their services. The original object of this\r\ntreaty was to induce Prussia to join the confederacy of European powers\r\nwhich England was now endeavouring to form against France, with a view\r\nto bring the war to a conclusion by an overwhelming military\r\ncombination; but Prussia, guarded and timid, declined to embark in the\r\ncoalition; and, failing that result, Russia accepted the alternative of\r\na subsidy proposed and guaranteed by the treaty. The value of her\r\nco-operation was not limited merely to the force she brought to bear\r\nagainst the enemy. England hoped that the influence of her example would\r\nstimulate the other Powers to concur in a general movement to repel the\r\naggressions of the French, who were rapidly extending the scene of\r\nhostilities, and who, in the course of this year, carried their arms\r\nover the whole surface of Italy, swept the banks of the Rhine,\r\npenetrated Holland, and ravaged the valleys of Switzerland.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Thomas Grenville set out upon his mission to the Courts of\r\nVienna and Berlin, intelligence had arrived of the disasters that had\r\nrecently befallen the King of Naples, who, alarmed at the approach of\r\nthe French, had taken the field with twenty thousand men, and was driven\r\nback by Championet with a much inferior force, and compelled to act upon\r\nthe defensive. The last news was that Naples had surrendered to the\r\nFrench after a gallant resistance, chiefly sustained by the Lazzaroni,\r\nwho have an insuperable aversion to all changes in their government.\r\n\r\nThe first incident that befell Mr. Grenville on his departure from\r\nEngland was inauspicious and discouraging. The weather was unusually\r\nsevere. On the night of Christmas Eve, the thermometer was 14 deg. below\r\nfreezing point; and for many weeks afterwards the snow lay so thickly on\r\nthe ground that the service of the ordinary coaches was arrested, and\r\nthe mails were forwarded on horseback. This delay and suspension of\r\ncommunication occasioned serious anxiety at a time when every item of\r\nintelligence was of importance to the country. The effect of the\r\ninclement state of the season was to force Mr. Grenville back to\r\nEngland. He embarked on his destination as had been arranged, but the\r\nsea was frozen up, and, unable to effect a landing, he was compelled to\r\nreturn and wait for a more favourable opportunity.\r\n\r\nThe Legislative Union between Great Britain and Ireland, which Ministers\r\nwere now preparing, was recommended to the consideration of Parliament\r\nin a message from the King on the 22nd of January. The Rebellion had\r\ngiven a decisive impulse to the project by effectually demonstrating the\r\nwant of power, energy, and influence of the local Parliament to control\r\nthe insubordinate spirit of the country, or to provide adequate remedies\r\nfor existing and acknowledged evils. It was considerably accelerated\r\nalso by the despair of the Protestants and the landed proprietors\r\ngenerally, who, exhausted by the long and wasting struggles of faction,\r\nlooked to England, across the ashes of a desolating insurrection, for\r\nthe last hope of relief from anarchy and spoliation. In the letters that\r\nimmediately follow, the views of Ministers in reference to the proposed\r\nplan are incidentally elucidated; and it appears, from Lord Grenville's\r\nallusions to the subject, that it was originally suggested to make the\r\nrepresentation of the Irish Peerage in the Imperial Legislature elective\r\nunder every new Parliament, like that of the Scotch Peerage; a mode of\r\nrepresentation to which Lord Grenville objected, although, in other\r\nrespects, he approved of the adoption of the Scotch Union as a model for\r\nimitation. He foresaw clearly the confusion and jealousies likely to be\r\nengendered in such a country as Ireland by repeated elections amongst a\r\nbody whose title to the right of election rested on hereditary grounds,\r\nand he felt that the frequent recurrence to such contests would re-open\r\nold grievances and party feuds, and, instead of satisfying the\r\nexpectations of the Peers, would only create a new element of\r\ndiscontent. The elective principle was the single feature in the Scotch\r\nUnion which Lord Grenville seems to have considered injudicious and\r\nimpolitic. We gather from many passages in his letters that he regarded\r\nharmony in the structure of the legislative body to be as essential to\r\nits effective action as unity in the executive; and that the nearer the\r\nHouse of Lords approached to permanency in the foundation of all its\r\nparts, the more completely would it realize, as a whole, the\r\nconstitutional theory of an hereditary estate.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Cleveland Row, Jan. 4th, 1799.\r\n     MY DEAREST BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     I have been so occupied this last week as really not to have had a\r\n     moment to write to you. We have indeed nothing to write; this frost\r\n     locks up all our communications; it has sent poor Tom back to us\r\n     after nine days' sea-sickness, and when I hoped he was already at\r\n     Berlin; and we are now told that less than a fortnight's thaw will\r\n     not open the intercourse again. In that time how many things may be\r\n     done, and what is worse, how many may not be done! Naples and\r\n     Sardinia, with all that belongs to them, you will have seen in the\r\n     French papers as fully as we, and we know no more.\r\n\r\n     In this interval the Union engrosses all my thoughts. I worked hard\r\n     when Lord Castlereagh was here to assist in expediting his return,\r\n     for I clearly see that without communication the thing will not do,\r\n     and that there can be none but through him. I was better satisfied\r\n     than I had expected with his manner of doing business, which I\r\n     found both ready and clear; and he seems to me to have the success\r\n     of this measure most thoroughly at heart. Your letters teach me\r\n     still to indulge hopes of success, but the prospect is certainly\r\n     less favourable than it was, and the difficulties of Government\r\n     with its supporters will be proportionably increased.\r\n\r\n     Before you receive this you will have learnt that Parnell has been\r\n     brought to a positive explanation of his sentiments. What the final\r\n     issue has been I do not yet know, but I conclude it will be\r\n     hostile, and in that case I think his removal will operate very\r\n     favourably, particularly in dissipating the foolish idea you\r\n     mention.\r\n\r\n     Lord Castlereagh brought over here a plan for the election of the\r\n     Commons which was approved, and indeed I am satisfied it is the\r\n     most reasonable. As it admits only nine or ten single members from\r\n     cities, &c., and classes all the other boroughs _by twos_ it seems\r\n     to me free from most of the objections you mention; all we cannot\r\n     hope to obviate, but must on the whole choose between contending\r\n     inconveniences on both sides. It is a very great merit of this plan\r\n     in my eyes that it so closely follows the model of the Scotch\r\n     Union.\r\n\r\n     Yet from that model I am tempted to think we ought to depart in the\r\n     election for the House of Lords, by choosing for life, and letting\r\n     the _electors_ sit in the House of Commons. When Lord Castlereagh\r\n     was here I drew a scheme for that purpose, which he has taken over\r\n     with him, in order to see which of the two plans is likely to be\r\n     most palatable to the Irish peerage--this, or the mode followed in\r\n     the Scotch Union. I own I think that the re-election of so large a\r\n     number as near fifty Peers in every Parliament would tend almost to\r\n     destroy the very principle of a House of Lords in our Constitution;\r\n     nor do I think a body of Peers excluded from Parliament (like the\r\n     Scotch) by any means a good elective body from Parliament to\r\n     Parliament. With one vacancy at a time, arising from death, they\r\n     may more safely be trusted.\r\n\r\n     You gave me hopes some time since of receiving from you some ideas\r\n     about provision for Catholic and Dissenting Clergy. I am very\r\n     anxious for them.\r\n\r\n     Adieu, I have exhausted my paper and my light.\r\n\r\n     God bless you.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Cleveland Row, Jan. 10th, 1799.\r\n     MY DEAREST BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     * * * It is for you to send news, and not to receive it, for\r\n     nothing is interesting just now but what relates to Ireland and the\r\n     Union. Twelve days bring us to the prologue, to this swelling\r\n     scene, as Shakspeare calls it. How long it will be before the\r\n     _denouement_, and what that _denouement_ will be, and what the\r\n     piece, who shall say?\r\n\r\n     Your chief Governor, you know, is not given to be very\r\n     communicative, either to his employers or to any one else; but I\r\n     collect from the statement in the newspapers that he has resolved\r\n     to adopt, without further reference here, the suggestions which\r\n     Lord Castlereagh carried over as to the members of the two Houses\r\n     in the United Parliament. I am very glad of it as to the House of\r\n     Lords, not only from parental fondness, but because on solid\r\n     grounds, as I think, I very much feared the effect of a septennial\r\n     election of fifty Peers not chosen by the very best possible bodies\r\n     of electors.\r\n\r\n     As to the House of Commons, it is almost entirely a question of\r\n     local expediency as to the best chance of satisfying _Messieurs les\r\n     interesses_; for you and I, who are not parliamentary reformers\r\n     (and, thank God, never were), do not hold very high the superior\r\n     virtue of a man chosen by one mode of election rather than by\r\n     another. I am, however, entirely satisfied that the plan of a\r\n     resident committee at Dublin was impracticable; and even if it had\r\n     not been so, the universal prejudice was so strong against it here,\r\n     on the part of everybody of every description who was talked to on\r\n     the subject, that it put the execution of such a plan totally out\r\n     of the question. The strongest, and with me quite decisive,\r\n     argument against it was the introduction into our Constitution of a\r\n     principle so perfectly novel and anomalous; the merit of the Scotch\r\n     Union having been, and that of the Irish being intended to be, its\r\n     simplicity, and the precision with which everything new is\r\n     accommodated to the existing state of our Constitution and\r\n     Government. In the Scotch Union, the Peerage was the only\r\n     exception; and in the present case we are, as you see, labouring to\r\n     bring even that point nearer to the actual practice.\r\n\r\n     Ever most affectionately yours,\r\n     G.\r\n\r\nLord Cornwallis had been avowedly selected for Ireland on account of his\r\nmilitary talents. But his Administration did not satisfy the Cabinet.\r\nLord Grenville, who confesses to the feeling of disappointment with\r\nwhich he reflects upon the results of the appointment, makes allowances\r\nfor the failure on the ground that Lord Cornwallis undertook the office\r\nunwillingly, and from a sense of public duty alone, and that he had\r\nexperienced nothing but disgusts and mortifications. In this case,\r\nhowever, as in all former cases, the difficulty was to find a successor.\r\nThere was, also, another consideration which Lord Grenville points\r\nout--the evils that always attended a change of Government in Ireland,\r\neven from worse to better.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Dropmore, Jan. 28th, 1799.\r\n     MY DEAREST BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     I am much more mortified than surprised at the event of the House\r\n     of Commons debate on the Union; for though Lord Castlereagh wrote\r\n     (as he talked) with confidence, yet one saw very clearly the\r\n     elements of ratting. I rejoice to hear that you think the question\r\n     recoverable, because I am more than ever of opinion that it must be\r\n     tried again and again, till it succeeds. With respect to the person\r\n     in whose hands it has failed, I may say to you (in _our_\r\n     confidence) that my opinion does not very much differ from yours,\r\n     if indeed it does at all. Since he has been in Ireland I have seen\r\n     no one trait of that character which I thought he had displayed in\r\n     former situations of great difficulty, and for which I still gave\r\n     him credit, though a nearer view of his mind had certainly\r\n     diminished the impressions which I once entertained on the subject.\r\n     Sorry I am to confess that I concurred heartily and eagerly in his\r\n     appointment, a measure, my share in which I shall deplore to the\r\n     hour of my death, though I certainly have nothing to reproach\r\n     myself with on that account, having done conscientiously what I\r\n     then thought the best, though I did not, even then, think it so\r\n     good as others did.\r\n\r\n     The question of his removal is, however, a very difficult one\r\n     indeed--one of the most embarrassing circumstances attending the\r\n     present state of Ireland being, that in that office, above all\r\n     others, the effect of change, even from worse to better, is\r\n     frequently, if not always, more mischievous than the continuance of\r\n     the evil. A violent and precipitate removal just now would, I\r\n     think, totally unhinge the Government, and it would, above all,\r\n     throw the whole absolutists at the feet of those who _perhaps_ (I\r\n     think, _certainly_) need not have been made enemies, but who being\r\n     such, must be guarded against as such. Lord Cornwallis never did\r\n     like the situation; he accepted it unwillingly, and, to do him\r\n     justice, I believe solely from a sense of public duty. Since he has\r\n     held it he has experienced nothing but disgusts of every kind, and\r\n     mortification in every shape, arising no doubt in a very great\r\n     degree from his own misconduct, but not on that account the less\r\n     galling to his mind. He can therefore certainly have no desire to\r\n     stay, and, I should think, would very probably desire to quit at\r\n     the close of this session, if the dread of foreign invasion is at\r\n     that time not very urgent.\r\n\r\n     But if it is, what officer have we to oppose to the domestic and\r\n     external enemies whom we should in such case have to meet? In a\r\n     situation requiring above all others the mixture of civil and\r\n     military talents, to a degree that the Duke of Marlborough scarce\r\n     possessed them, and for which we must provide by sending some old\r\n     woman in a red riband that has not a grain of either.\r\n\r\n     You see it is easy enough to start difficulties, but I do not think\r\n     myself quite so ready at expedients as I wish I was. This is, I\r\n     believe, a case where nothing is to be done just now, but to remain\r\n     quite steady, announcing an unalterable purpose of carrying this\r\n     great measure, and a fixed persuasion that we must succeed in it.\r\n     And as to all the rest, if Paddy will set fire to his own house, we\r\n     must try to put it out if we can, and if we cannot, we must keep\r\n     the engine ready to play upon our own.\r\n\r\n     I rejoice that you took the determination, both of not speaking or\r\n     attending this question in the Irish House of Lords, and of giving\r\n     your proxy to the Chancellor, which was at once showing him a mark\r\n     of attention and confidence, which he well deserves, and\r\n     manifesting your own sentiments in the only way at all consistent\r\n     with your situation. A little more than two months will now close\r\n     your pilgrimage, from which you will return with the satisfaction\r\n     of having done a great deal of good, though not quite all that you\r\n     might have done if others had done their part.\r\n\r\n     God bless you.\r\n\r\n     You will see in to-day's papers the fate of the poor King of\r\n     Naples. The infatuation of the Emperor is like nothing but that of\r\n     an Irish Orangeman.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of January, Mr. Thomas Grenville again left England on\r\nhis mission; but his second departure proved even more unfortunate and\r\ndisastrous than the first. The vessel in which he had sailed was\r\nsupposed to have made the Elbe, and to have been lost in the ice. The\r\ndistressing tidings, or rather the terrible apprehensions caused by the\r\nabsence of any authentic or reliable intelligence, were immediately\r\nforwarded to Lord Buckingham. For several days this state of dreadful\r\nsuspense continued. Every fragment of news that afforded the slightest\r\nground of hope was eagerly seized upon; and, in the anxious solicitude\r\nof that affection which appears so touchingly all throughout these\r\nletters, Lord Grenville communicated to Lord Buckingham all he could\r\nlearn from day to day. At last came the joyful intelligence that he was\r\nsafe! This happy news was rapidly followed by letters from Mr. Grenville\r\nhimself, and from his Secretary, Mr. Fisher, announcing his landing at\r\nCuxhaven, and his subsequent arrival at Berlin.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. FISHER TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Cuxhaven, Thursday, Feb. 7th, 1799.\r\n     MY DEAR LORD,\r\n\r\n     I cannot think of leaving this place without first acquainting you\r\n     of our safe arrival here, after experiencing a thousand dangers and\r\n     difficulties in consequence of our ship having run aground on the\r\n     Newerk bank, at the entrance of the Elbe.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Grenville, I am delighted to be able to assure you, is in good\r\n     health, notwithstanding the extreme fatigue he has undergone since\r\n     Thursday last. The few hours he stays here being entirely occupied\r\n     with writing letters of business, he fears he shall not have time\r\n     to write to you from hence. The same reasons, my dear Lord, will\r\n     deprive me of the honour of giving you, at the present moment, the\r\n     details of our misfortunes. The officers and crew are all saved\r\n     with the exception of thirteen seamen, and one woman and child, who\r\n     were frozen to death in attempting to gain Newerk from the wreck.\r\n     We are without a change of any one article of dress, and we fear\r\n     there is little probability of saving any part of our baggage. We,\r\n     however, proceed on our journey in a few hours to Berlin, from\r\n     whence it shall be my first care to write to you the particulars of\r\n     the melancholy events of the last week. Mr. Wynne is quite well,\r\n     and has on every occasion of danger and difficulty shown the\r\n     greatest fortitude and discretion.\r\n\r\n     I beg to be recalled to the remembrance of Lady Buckingham. Believe\r\n     me, my dear Lord, to be ever, with the most grateful attachment,\r\n     your Lordship's most obliged and most devoted servant,\r\n\r\n     EDWARD FISHER.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. T. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Cuxhaven, Feb. 7th, 1799.\r\n     MY DEAREST BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     The fatigue which I have undergone, added to the necessity of my\r\n     writing several letters upon my arrival here, makes it impossible\r\n     for me to say more to you than that I am alive and well, after a\r\n     miraculous escape from the 'Proserpine,' which ran ashore off\r\n     Searhorn, and a second danger, scarcely less, yesterday morning, in\r\n     a long walk to gain this place, during which we were overtaken by\r\n     the tide and forced to wade for an hour, in the hardest frost I\r\n     ever felt, against a strong current of tide, which was sometimes up\r\n     to, and sometimes above our middle. We are all, however, well\r\n     to-day, and I proceed this evening towards Berlin, as well as my\r\n     fatigues will allow me. I cannot say enough to you of Mr. Fisher's\r\n     behaviour in these trials of danger; his resources, his attachment,\r\n     and his kind attentions in assisting our poor Henry, and lessening,\r\n     where he could, the inconvenience of my situation, have entitled\r\n     him and ensured to him the sincerest and warmest regard. Henry,\r\n     likewise, has been a stout mariner, and has shown a fortitude much\r\n     beyond his years.\r\n\r\n     I find no Italian news except a report of the French having\r\n     possession of Naples. They have, likewise, Ehrenbreitstein. When\r\n     will they have Berlin? We have not a shirt in company. My loss,\r\n     about L700.\r\n\r\n     God Almighty bless and preserve you.\r\n\r\nHaving arrived safely at Berlin, Mr. Grenville gives a sketch of his\r\nfirst impressions of the King of Prussia and his Court.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. T. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Berlin, Feb. 28th, 1799.\r\n     MY DEAREST BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     The journal which Mr. Fisher has shown to me, and which he proposes\r\n     to send to you by this messenger, will give you a much more\r\n     accurate account of our voyage than I could pretend to do if I had\r\n     time to undertake it; but that is unfortunately so far from being\r\n     the case, that I can with difficulty catch a short time by this\r\n     opportunity to write even a few words to you.\r\n\r\n     We arrived here on the 17th, and I have scarcely yet got through\r\n     the endless presentations and the weary first suppers of the\r\n     Princes, which engross the whole evening from six in the evening\r\n     till one in the morning. I have seen the King hitherto very little,\r\n     but I am going to dine with him to-day; he is thought to be\r\n     well-disposed in his general intentions, perfectly aware of all he\r\n     has to fear from the great nation whom he detests and abhors; but\r\n     having no original opinions of his own, nor habits of forming his\r\n     own judgment, he falls unfortunately too much into the hands of the\r\n     military officers, particularly the aides-de-camp with whom he\r\n     lives, and their influence is, in consequence, powerful enough to\r\n     weigh sometimes against the opinions of the Ministers whom he\r\n     employs.\r\n\r\n     The general idea here is, that the person who has most weight with\r\n     him is an aide-de-camp named Kochentz, of whose honesty there is no\r\n     suspicion, but whose talents and capacity are of a very inferior\r\n     description, and who is therefore open to the artifices of bad and\r\n     designing men, who work powerfully through him upon the King.\r\n\r\n     Haugwiz is believed to be sincere in his apprehensions of the\r\n     general danger of French republicanism, and is considered as\r\n     struggling against the more immediate followers of the King, who\r\n     surround him daily, and haunt him with the dreadful consequences of\r\n     war to Prussia, and the old jealousies and distrusts of Austria.\r\n\r\n     If the Court of Vienna should at last act, as I am almost disposed\r\n     to think they will rather than send back the Russian troops at the\r\n     requisition of France, the beginning of hostilities from that Court\r\n     cannot fail of producing a good effect here; the great danger is,\r\n     that while each is waiting for the other to begin, the time for\r\n     useful and effective exertion will pass by.\r\n\r\n     I have seen Sieyes at Court with his scarf and cockade. What\r\n     Lavater would say of his features I know not, but I have seldom\r\n     seen a countenance of so bad impression. His manners, conduct and\r\n     appearance here have produced nothing but disgust in all that are\r\n     not of the lower ranks of life, but it is to those that his mission\r\n     is considered as being chiefly addressed, and he is said to have\r\n     both means and agents enough to work through upon the lower classes\r\n     of men here.\r\n\r\n     I have heard nothing from England or Ireland since I left Yarmouth,\r\n     nothing of Union, and nothing of you; but how can I till the\r\n     summer, if the last ten days of soft weather will not unlock the\r\n     inhospitable ice of the Elbe at Cuxhaven? We are all well. God send\r\n     that you and yours are so. Love to Lord B. and George and Mary. The\r\n     Major is, I trust, soon expecting you in England.\r\n\r\n     God bless you, dearest brother. You will be glad to hear great part\r\n     of my baggage is saved.\r\n\r\nThe negotiations which the French had been carrying on at Rastadt\r\nrelative to the German boundaries, were broken off in consequence of the\r\nEmperor having permitted the Russian troops to enter his dominions; and\r\non the 1st of March, the Directory having declared war against him,\r\nJourdan, at the head of forty thousand men, crossed the Rhine at Kehl\r\nand Basle. Austria was now fairly committed to the war, and,\r\nstrengthened by the Russians, who entered into it with enthusiasm,\r\nachieved a succession of important movements. On the 5th of March, the\r\nArch-Duke Charles crossed the Leck; and on the 25th, defeated Jourdan at\r\nthe battle of Stockach, and, leaving ten thousand men dead or expiring\r\non the field, compelled the French to retire towards the Rhine. This\r\ntriumph was followed up vigorously by the battle of Magnan, on the 5th\r\nof April, in which the Austrians, under Kray, joined by the vanguard of\r\nthe Russians, effected so signal a victory, that Scherer, beaten for the\r\nthird time in the course of the campaign, fled in precipitation across\r\nthe Nincio. The effect of these encouraging successes was utterly lost\r\non the Court of Prussia, where the policy, or no-policy, of doing\r\nnothing still prevailed over the counsels of friends, and the menaces of\r\nenemies. The picture Mr. Grenville gives of the weakness and incapacity\r\nof the Government suggests the only intelligible explanation of the\r\nconduct they pursued at this juncture.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. T. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Berlin, April 17th, 1799.\r\n\r\n     If I am behind-hand, my dearest brother, in thanking you for your\r\n     two letters of the 11th and 24th of March, I am less so than those\r\n     dates would lead you to imagine, for the messengers did not bring\r\n     me the first of them till a week ago, and the last arrived here\r\n     only the day before yesterday. The amities of the 'Proserpine' are\r\n     out of date with me, and would long ago have been forgotten, if\r\n     they were not daily recalled to me by new and continued proofs of\r\n     the affectionate interest which has been taken in them. To know\r\n     what you would feel in a state of anxiety and suspense which I\r\n     could not relieve, was a distress greater to me than the fatigue\r\n     and danger which accompanied my escape. It has ended well, and I\r\n     trust it will not be long before we shall laugh over it together.\r\n\r\n     I presume that you will have heard from William how exactly the\r\n     politics of Berlin have continued to remain in _statu quo_; how\r\n     much more occupied they are in enumerating the follies and\r\n     disgraces of Austria, than in adapting their own conduct to any\r\n     wise system or any liberal principles, and how little applicable\r\n     are the measures which they take, either to the danger which they\r\n     fear, or to the hopes which they entertain. Their fear of France\r\n     is, however, not dissembled by them, and certainly is not affected\r\n     by them; it engrosses all their attention, and furnishes to them\r\n     great and constant disquietude in the present, and serious\r\n     apprehension for the future. But as there is no man of leading and\r\n     commanding talents enough to show them the greatness of their\r\n     danger, and to provoke from the public the adequate means of\r\n     resisting it, there is nothing done by the Government, and they are\r\n     living on from day to day, conscious of all they have to fear, but\r\n     destitute of energy and activity, and submitting to a state of\r\n     things which could only be produced by the most extreme weakness\r\n     and incapacity; for you will certainly have remarked that the\r\n     little influence which Prussia exercises, either from her hopes or\r\n     fears, in Europe, is not owing to the defeat of any great and\r\n     ambitious projects, is not to be attributed to the disappointment\r\n     of any great plans, civil or military, but to a total absence of\r\n     any leading and governing talents in those who direct the measures\r\n     which prevail here.\r\n\r\n     It has been the fashion, I know, to consider the influencing men\r\n     here as having views and principles of a bad description, and as\r\n     being engaged in a systematic course of conduct pursued by them\r\n     with great address and dissimulation. It is perhaps presumptuous in\r\n     a stranger, as I am, to trust to any opinion formed upon so short a\r\n     residence amongst them, but if I am sure of anything, I tell myself\r\n     I may be sure that the miserable policy which is seen here is very\r\n     much more weak than wicked, and the wretched state of Government\r\n     much more to be attributed to the absence of great talents than the\r\n     influence of deep and dangerous designs. Whatever be the cause, the\r\n     effect is the same; and although it seems to be a pretty universal\r\n     opinion that Prussia must and will at length be driven into war,\r\n     they are content rather to let their enemy choose that moment for\r\n     the commencement of hostilities, than make common cause and fight\r\n     one common battle, which in my conscience I believe would be\r\n     successful. Indeed, the Austrian successes in driving the French to\r\n     the Rhine, if they are followed by similar success in Switzerland,\r\n     will almost justify one's hope that, even without Prussia, the\r\n     French may in this campaign be pushed back upon their own country;\r\n     and the continued state of insurrection in the Low Countries, where\r\n     the republican troops can scarcely restrain the inhabitants, give\r\n     good hopes on that side as soon as any solid force could be made to\r\n     bear in that quarter. The zeal and enthusiasm of the Court of\r\n     Petersburg increases every hour, and they will become very\r\n     immediately principals in the war against France, both by word and\r\n     deed.\r\n\r\n     In this immediate state of the negotiation, I am remaining here\r\n     more because there is an inclination in London to think I can do\r\n     good, than from any great good that is likely to be done. I am\r\n     very much obliged to you for your offer of a loan, which, however,\r\n     I hope will be unnecessary by the shortness of my stay. If that\r\n     should unexpectedly be prolonged, I will then have recourse to you\r\n     to assist by an advance the tardy payment of His Majesty's Envoys\r\n     Extraordinary and Ministers Plenipotentiary, who are always left in\r\n     arrears seven quarters for the better credit of the Court that\r\n     employs them. I hope my loss by the 'Proserpine' will turn out not\r\n     to exceed L600, as many things have been saved.\r\n\r\n     I trust you are now happy and well at Stowe. God bless you, dearest\r\n     brother.\r\n\r\nBy this time, Lord Buckingham had returned to England, and the next\r\ndespatch from Berlin is addressed to Stowe. The account of the\r\nvacillation of the Court, and the sketch Mr. Grenville gives of the\r\nKing, are full of interest. Since he had last written, Suwaroff had\r\ntaken the command of the Austro-Russian armies in Italy, and in a short\r\ntime had expelled the French from the principal towns of the North,\r\nwhich forced Macdonald to evacuate Naples, and cross the Apennines.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. T. GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Berlin, May 25th, 1799.\r\n     MY DEAREST BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     My last letters from Cleveland Row have, thank God, brought you\r\n     back safe and sound to your own fireside and to the many who share\r\n     the comforts of it with you; it cannot, I presume, be very long\r\n     before I may reckon myself of that number, although as I do not\r\n     like to do anything by halves, I consider myself as liable to duty\r\n     as long there is any fair demand to be made upon me. You will have\r\n     heard from William all that was to be heard of our hopes and of our\r\n     disappointments, and you will know likewise from him that our stock\r\n     of those articles is not yet exhausted, although the briskness of\r\n     the market is a little affected by the absence of the King. The\r\n     Berlin reviews being over, he has begun a military progress, which\r\n     will carry him through Brunswick, Minden and Wesel to Cassel and to\r\n     Anspach, and after various reviews in those places he will return\r\n     to Potsdam in the first week of July.\r\n\r\n     Whether in the first of these places, or in the last, or in any of\r\n     them, he will have determined to take his part with us, remains to\r\n     be decided, and it will be less hazardous to abide the event than\r\n     to pretend to foretel it. It is certain that the inclination to war\r\n     has grown very much of late among all the thinking men in the\r\n     country, and the regular Ministers have agreed in recommending it\r\n     very strongly to the King; the disinclination to it is chiefly\r\n     found in the confidential aides-de-camp and the subordinate\r\n     characters, whose familiar habits with the King enable them to\r\n     exercise a very governing influence upon him.\r\n\r\n     The King himself is, I believe, of a very well-disposed and honest\r\n     character; his inclinations are English, and his personal respect\r\n     for the King of England is very striking; his suspicion and dislike\r\n     of the French is also beyond all question, and there are so many\r\n     ingredients in his situation and character that should lead him to\r\n     an open declaration against France, that it is not easy to account\r\n     for the different line which he pursues; it must, however, be\r\n     attributed to the influence of the very weak persons who are in\r\n     familiar confidence with him, and to his being too diffident in\r\n     himself to decide upon the important measure of engaging Prussia in\r\n     war. I am, however, inclined to believe that such will at last be\r\n     his decision, though there is too much hesitation in his own mind\r\n     to give us any solid ground of reliance until he shall be\r\n     completely embarked.\r\n\r\n     Meantime, all is going on prosperously under the active exertions\r\n     of Suwaroff, who is daily hemming in and menacing Turin, and who\r\n     has now advanced to Chivasso, and has detached Kaim with a\r\n     considerable force to the Valais. The general opinion here is that\r\n     the French will evacuate Switzerland whenever their line at\r\n     Luceinsteig and Coire is forced, and some accounts to-day seem to\r\n     announce that event as having happened.\r\n\r\n     Moreau, with seventeen thousand men, is at Alexandria, and I\r\n     suppose the Naples army will try to join him, although Macdonald\r\n     will find that junction rather difficult to accomplish.\r\n\r\n     We are all still waiting in anxious expectation for news of the\r\n     fleet. The Ministers here think the Mediterranean is the object,\r\n     and to me it seems not unlikely that they may pursue that object,\r\n     and at the same time detach to Ireland.\r\n\r\n     God bless you, dearest brother.\r\n\r\nThe occupation which was given by the Austrians and Russians to the\r\nFrench troops in Italy and Germany, appearing to offer a favourable\r\nopportunity to rescue Holland from the hands of the republicans, an\r\nexpedition, under the command of Sir Ralph Abercromby, set sail from\r\nEngland on the 13th of August, and disembarked off the Helder. On the\r\n30th, the Dutch fleet surrendered, and hoisted the Orange flag. In\r\norder, probably, to give more weight and effect to a mission which had\r\nfor its object the restoration of the Stadtholder, it was proposed that\r\nLord Grenville should undertake an embassy to Holland, and that Mr.\r\nThomas Grenville (who had in the interim returned home) should proceed\r\nto St. Petersburg.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Dropmore, Sept. 5th, 1799.\r\n     MY DEAREST BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     I was much obliged to you for your kindness to us in writing on the\r\n     subject of Lady B. We earnestly hope that all cause of uneasiness\r\n     to you on her account has ceased, and that both fever and cold are\r\n     gone. If you would let anybody write us a line to say so, you would\r\n     much oblige us.\r\n\r\n     You will have seen that, in spite of wind, we have succeeded at the\r\n     Texel. The Lieutenant says that the Dutch fleet had cut the buoys,\r\n     and run up into the Zuyder Zee. Lord D. was preparing to lay the\r\n     buoys down again, and to follow them, but it was not expected that\r\n     Storey would make any further resistance, more than half his fleet\r\n     being Stadtholderians.\r\n\r\n     The wind is now changed to the N.E., as if to bring our Russians.\r\n     The Dutch reported that they were to have had nine thousand French\r\n     at the Helder by the Wednesday night, but that is doubted. I have\r\n     not learnt what their actual force is, but it appears that there\r\n     were some Trench there. We have now about seventeen thousand men\r\n     there, and when the transports return, we can, if necessary, send\r\n     ten thousand more, besides our eighteen thousand Russians. I trust,\r\n     therefore, I am not very sanguine in thinking the business as\r\n     nearly certain as one can allow oneself to call anything in these\r\n     times.\r\n\r\n     But for the plans which we have in view, supposing this to\r\n     terminate well, and soon, we want full twenty thousand more British\r\n     force. Do you think it is possible to get them from the Militia?\r\n     and how? Dundas is revolving in his mind projects for the purpose,\r\n     but I should much wish to know from you whether you think the thing\r\n     practicable for a great object, and in what manner.\r\n\r\n     An idea has been proposed to me, which I think I shall not be at\r\n     liberty to decline, if, when the time comes, I should myself be\r\n     satisfied that I could be of more use than other people: it is to\r\n     go to Holland as Ambassador Extraordinary, carrying myself and my\r\n     office there for about a month or six weeks, to help to fix Old\r\n     Stadt a little more firmly in his chair. You know I had destined\r\n     Tom to this service, and if he should go, I still think my going\r\n     would be quite superfluous. He had agreed to undertake the service\r\n     as a temporary one only; but I have been since urged to press him\r\n     to go to Petersburg, to establish a further concert there, and I\r\n     trust he will not refuse the earnest entreaties we have made him on\r\n     that subject. You may suppose that I do not look to this as a very\r\n     pleasant interlude to my other business, but I cannot deny that it\r\n     is at least possible I may be of use there, and if so, I must\r\n     practise as I preach.\r\n\r\n     God bless you, my dearest brother.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Dropmore, Sept. 5th, 1799.\r\n     MY DEAREST BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     Your letter, which I received yesterday, though a little more\r\n     satisfactory than your former account, still leaves room for so\r\n     much uneasiness, that Lady G. and I are extremely anxious to hear\r\n     again from you, and I trust in God the answer will be such as to\r\n     set us quite at our ease; but the complaints of which you speak are\r\n     of so ugly a nature, that one cannot feel satisfied while any trace\r\n     of them remains.\r\n\r\n     I have not yet my answer from Tom; but by an intermediate letter,\r\n     I guess that he will be very little disposed to undertake this\r\n     jaunt to Petersburg. Even if he should not, but should go to\r\n     Holland, I am not quite sure that I must not go, for as short a\r\n     time as I speak of, to assist him in Holland; not that personally\r\n     I have the vanity to think that I could do any part of the\r\n     business better, or as well as he, but my red boxes and my seals\r\n     would have a great effect in enabling me to expedite, and even in\r\n     some degree to _brusque_ a business which, if left to Dutch\r\n     arrangement only, or with nothing more than the usual aid of an\r\n     English Ambassador, would take not six months, as you say, but\r\n     six years, and not be done at last.\r\n\r\n     I fully understand the nature of your offer, and should not\r\n     certainly have suspected even, if you had not explained it, that\r\n     you were canvassing for the delectable amusement of leaving Stowe\r\n     and England, to figure at the Hague or Petersburg. But the best\r\n     negotiation you can carry on for us just now would be one with the\r\n     Militia for giving us twenty thousand more men. I hardly dare say,\r\n     or let myself think, what we could do, or rather what we could not\r\n     do, with such a reinforcement, supposing Holland to go on quick,\r\n     and our troops not to suffer much from sickness; for of their\r\n     suffering in battle there, I am not much afraid.\r\n\r\n     If any fresh parliamentary authority is necessary, we can now call\r\n     Parliament together in a fortnight. I will write to Dundas, as you\r\n     desire. If I had known of his coming to town to review his East\r\n     India regiment, I would have proposed precisely the Dropmore plan\r\n     you speak of; but I fear you could hardly have looked at it at that\r\n     moment, and I presume he is gone back to Walmer; I shall, however,\r\n     expect his answer.\r\n\r\n     Ever most affectionately yours,\r\n     G.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Dropmore, Sept. 9th, 1799.\r\n     MY DEAREST BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     I hope, from your account, that the worst is over, and that Lady B.\r\n     will continue to mend, but we shall be very anxious to hear that it\r\n     is so. If nothing new arise, and if we shall not be troublesome to\r\n     you, we think of being with you on Wednesday in next week; but pray\r\n     let us know if you would wish us to delay our visit.\r\n\r\n     If the project holds respecting Holland, it is likely, I think,\r\n     that I shall not be much longer before I am called upon to begin my\r\n     preparations. I have as yet no answer from Tom, but I shall have\r\n     one to-day or to-morrow; for we know that the wind changed to the\r\n     eastward on the other side the water on Friday, and we have three\r\n     mails due.\r\n\r\n     Our first division of Russians, five thousand two hundred men, are\r\n     arrived, and are under sailing orders for the Texel. Popham left\r\n     the second division at Elsineur on Sunday last; and calculates that\r\n     both this and the rear division, amounting together to above eleven\r\n     thousand men, will be here by Tuesday or Wednesday next. Our own\r\n     transports were also beginning to arrive, so that we shall have to\r\n     send them in the course of a week or ten days a reinforcement of\r\n     twenty-six thousand men, besides cavalry. I have no doubt that this\r\n     is more than sufficient, with tolerable activity and enterprise, to\r\n     do our work completely, and in a very few weeks--I might almost say\r\n     days--for we have the command of the Zuyder Zee, by which we can\r\n     turn the enemy on their right, and of the North Sea, which equally\r\n     turns their left; and they have, I am confident, no means of\r\n     assembling an army of half the force of ours, to oppose it in\r\n     front. All this, however, is a question of time; for if that is\r\n     allowed them, one can answer for nothing.\r\n\r\n     We have not heard of Abercromby (nor indeed could we) since the\r\n     31st. He was then preparing to march forward to Alkmaar. Have you\r\n     got Wiebeking's map of Holland and Utrecht? If not, let anybody\r\n     write for it for you from Hamburgh. You will see, indeed, in any\r\n     map, a little promontory that runs forward opposite to Amsterdam,\r\n     on the north bank of the Y., between Buyksloot and Newdam. The\r\n     opinion of persons of the country is, that if we can make ourselves\r\n     masters of that point, Amsterdam is open to be bombarded, and must\r\n     capitulate on the first summons. All the other advantages of the\r\n     country we have to act in, upon our line of march, are obvious by\r\n     looking at the map. The disadvantages are, the facility of\r\n     retarding our march by defending the dykes and narrow causeways\r\n     along which we must pass; but a great superiority of force will\r\n     enable us to surmount many of these. The French papers talk of\r\n     having marched against us the garrisons of the Generality. So much\r\n     the better if it is so, for then we shall not find them there, and\r\n     the fact itself proves (if even our intelligence were defective)\r\n     how little other force they have in the country.\r\n\r\n     I am greatly obliged to you for what you have written on the\r\n     subject of the Militia. It seems to me that allowing the Militia to\r\n     volunteer by companies for a fixed time is the best suggestion I\r\n     have yet heard. But it would be necessary to consider, on a\r\n     statement of numbers, how many could be so procured from all the\r\n     Militias--English, Scotch, and Irish--though, with respect to these\r\n     last, there is, I fear, an insurmountable difficulty, from the\r\n     necessity of assembling Parliament, which could not be done in\r\n     Ireland without broaching the question of Union before we are\r\n     prepared for it.\r\n\r\n     Less than twenty thousand men would not, on the most sanguine\r\n     calculations, answer our object, and the issue of the war so much\r\n     depends upon it that we should be unpardonable to omit any possible\r\n     effort that we could make for it. What we want is to be able to\r\n     garrison Holland with twenty thousand men so as to have as soon as\r\n     possible after the conquest of it the means of disposing of our\r\n     whole army now there. It is a very doubtful question, I think,\r\n     whether our Militia volunteering would be more or less promoted if\r\n     we confined our proposal to that particular service, and sent our\r\n     Militia battalions into the Dutch garrisons, employing the army now\r\n     there in the active service, or if we took the offer generally for\r\n     foreign service, and made such distribution between the two as\r\n     might best suit our convenience.\r\n\r\n     There would be no difficulty as to Parliament; we can call them\r\n     together at a fortnight's notice. We would do so for this object\r\n     alone. The King would speak of nothing else, and ask no supply; and\r\n     we could easily, in a moment of triumph like the present, exclude\r\n     all other discussions, so that the execution, were the plan once\r\n     arranged to the satisfaction of the Militia officers, would take up\r\n     not more than ten days or a fortnight at most.\r\n\r\n     If anything new occurs to you upon it, let me hear it. If not, we\r\n     will talk it over when we meet; but as that is always precarious,\r\n     write if you have anything to suggest upon it.\r\n\r\n     Ever yours,\r\n     G.\r\n\r\nA year, memorable in the annals of the war for the European confederacy\r\nwhich was formed by the energies of England to resist the aggressions of\r\nFrance, and for the successes by which it was crowned, was now drawing\r\nto a close. How much of that vast machinery of diplomacy, of that\r\nactivity in council and promptitude in action, by which the happy\r\nresults were obtained, may be justly attributed to the genius and\r\nfirmness of the distinguished statesmen whose correspondence forms the\r\nsubstance of these volumes, need scarcely be pointed out; nor would it\r\nbe becoming in this work to pronounce the eulogy which their virtues and\r\npatriotism deserve. That grateful duty may be securely left to history.\r\n\r\nThe last letter of the year appropriately terminates the record of its\r\nevents, by a general outline of the projects that were contemplated and\r\nin preparation for the arduous and important period that marked the\r\nopening of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD GRENVILLE TO THE MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM.\r\n\r\n     Cleveland Row, Nov. 6th, 1799.\r\n     MY DEAREST BROTHER,\r\n\r\n     I have just received your letter. My business seems to increase\r\n     upon me so much that I fear I must abandon all hope of my Stowe\r\n     project. I heartily wish that I could see the means of executing\r\n     the idea you mention, but our force is not as yet sufficient for\r\n     the purpose, especially considering that the possession of the\r\n     country would give the enemy such incalculable advantage over an\r\n     army whose communication would be maintained in that season across\r\n     the Channel. We cannot well put the army brought back from Holland\r\n     at more than thirty thousand effective men, including Russians.\r\n     Twenty or twenty-five thousand Militia volunteers, English and\r\n     Irish, may be added to this during the winter if our last measure\r\n     succeeds, and other additions will also be gradually coming\r\n     forward; but I doubt whether even then we shall have enough to\r\n     encounter the mass of force which the enemy could bring against us\r\n     in his own country, if not occupied by some serious attack on the\r\n     other side.\r\n\r\n     Our system must therefore, I think, of necessity be this, viz.: to\r\n     complete the winter in negotiating on the continent, in furnishing\r\n     supplies to the royalists, who have, however, shown themselves much\r\n     too soon, both for their own interest and ours; and in nursing up\r\n     our own force to make it as considerable and as fit for action as\r\n     we can.\r\n\r\n     In the spring its employment must be regulated by the state of the\r\n     other two points. If Austria has made her peace (which, though\r\n     certainly not improbable, I do not however consider as the most\r\n     likely event), and if the royalists are crushed, our force can then\r\n     only be used in desultory expeditions to annoy the enemy, and\r\n     weaken his means of acting against us; for to make a serious\r\n     impression on France with sixty, or even eighty thousand men,\r\n     unsupported by any diversion, is impossible, and the attempt can\r\n     only lead to disaster, and to the loss of the only army we ever can\r\n     have during this war. This was our situation in 1798. We fought\r\n     manfully through it under much greater disadvantages than we should\r\n     now have to meet. The enemy was stronger and more abundant in\r\n     resources. We were weaker in force, and the extent of our means was\r\n     unknown even to ourselves.\r\n\r\n     If, on the contrary, the French are materially occupied either by\r\n     Austria, or by royalists, or still better if by both, we may then\r\n     choose our own point of attack; our fleet will threaten the whole\r\n     coast from Cadiz to the Texel and Delfzuyl, and nothing but a\r\n     course of ill luck, equal to that of this year, can deprive us of\r\n     the benefit of a fortnight or three weeks' start in whatever point\r\n     we really attack.\r\n\r\n     I should be sorry that any degree even of private blame in people's\r\n     minds should attach on the Duke of York, who has, I really believe,\r\n     had no other fault on this occasion than that of following, perhaps\r\n     too implicitly, the advice of those whose advice he was desired to\r\n     follow. In many things he has certainly done extremely well.\r\n\r\n     The business of the Union is going on well, and I trust rapidly\r\n     approaching to a conclusion. Even if it were possible that we\r\n     should again fail next year, still I should regard the ultimate\r\n     success of the measure as certain.\r\n\r\n     I have been ruminating on some ecclesiastical projects, but I do\r\n     not know whether I shall be able to bring them to bear, nor do I\r\n     yet possess all the knowledge of the actual state of things which\r\n     is necessary in order to enable me to fix my own judgment. They\r\n     relate to the two points of episcopal jurisdiction and\r\n     superintendence, and residence of parochial clergy.\r\n\r\n     My notion is to strengthen, if necessary, the legal powers of the\r\n     bishops, so as to give them effective means, both of suspension and\r\n     deprivation, in all cases, both of improper life and manners, and\r\n     of remissness in the execution of certain _stated duties_ which\r\n     they are to be required to exact from all their parochial clergy.\r\n     To enable them, from the chapters in their dioceses, at their own\r\n     choice, to augment the number of their archdeacons or _visitants_,\r\n     under whatever name may best suit the old constitutional forms of\r\n     our Church. To require them, or in their absence, the archdeacon,\r\n     or other proper person, to hold fixed and invariable annual\r\n     visitations; at which, calling, if necessary, to their assistance a\r\n     certain number of their beneficed or dignified clergy, they should\r\n     receive the reports of their archdeacons and other visitants, and\r\n     should _at such visitation_, or at furthest at the next visitation,\r\n     proceed by sentence either of suspension or deprivation against all\r\n     persons who should appear on such reports to be of scandalous life\r\n     or conversation, or to have published irreligious, immoral, or\r\n     seditious books, or to have been remiss in the performance of such\r\n     _stated duties_ as above. Lastly, to compel the bishops to return\r\n     these reports, and their proceedings thereon at their visitations,\r\n     to their metropolitans, by whom they should be annually laid before\r\n     the King, with their observations thereon.\r\n\r\n     As to parochial residence, the idea would be to require that no\r\n     person shall on any pretence be non-resident on his living, without\r\n     appointing a curate to be there _constantly_ resident in his room.\r\n     And to charge on the consolidated fund a sum sufficient to make up\r\n     every living throughout the kingdom to the amount of L70 per annum,\r\n     with the single exception of such parishes as, being adjacent to\r\n     each other, it might be fit to _conjoin_ for this purpose, by the\r\n     act of proper commissioners to act with the bishop, &c.\r\n\r\n     When, therefore, the living fell short of L70, the parson would\r\n     receive the difference from the public, but would be compelled to\r\n     personal and constant residence, (and some provision might be made\r\n     for the residence and maintenance of his curate in the single case\r\n     of absence with the bishop's licence, from _extreme necessity_ of\r\n     sickness). When the living amounted to L70 or upwards, he would\r\n     have the choice, as at present, of residing, or finding some legal\r\n     excuse for non-residence; but in the latter case he would be\r\n     obliged to provide a curate _constantly_ resident. And in both\r\n     cases proper certificates of residence would be required to be\r\n     produced to the _visitants_.\r\n\r\n     The hardship, whatever it was, which this regulation would bring on\r\n     the body of the clergy at large (I do not speak of particular\r\n     cases), would be amply compensated by the addition which the\r\n     Legislature would thus make to the smaller livings; and the expense\r\n     of this last measure would be much more than compensated to the\r\n     public, by the benefit which must arise from the constant residence\r\n     of a clergyman in every parish throughout the kingdom.\r\n\r\n     By what I have called _stated duties_ above, I mean, that from\r\n     these resident clergymen, who would no longer have the plea of\r\n     other duty to perform, I would certainly exact, by enumeration,\r\n     many points of their duty (evening service, catechism, visitation\r\n     of sick, and other points), which are now growing, or grown into\r\n     disuse.\r\n\r\n     You would much oblige me by your ideas on these points. On the\r\n     first I have been told that it is no more, or little more, than the\r\n     law as it now exists. All I can say is, that I am sure it is not\r\n     the practice as it now exists; and that this is not the only case\r\n     where it has been found to be highly useful to re-enact, with small\r\n     variation, the existing law, in order to call the attention and\r\n     excite the zeal, both of those who are to execute the law, and of\r\n     those who are to obey it.\r\n\r\n     You are not, I am very certain, one of those extremely profound\r\n     politicians who have, among other happy discoveries of this age,\r\n     found out that the religion of the people has no influence on its\r\n     morals, or its morals on the prosperity and good government of the\r\n     State. You will not, therefore, think that an attention to this\r\n     subject is either unbecoming Government and Parliament, or is ill\r\n     suited to such a moment as the present.\r\n\r\n     God bless you, my dear brother.\r\n\r\n     Ever most affectionately yours,\r\n     G.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\nLONDON:\r\nPrinted by Schulze and Co., 13, Poland Street.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n13, GREAT MARLBOROUGH STREET.\r\nCOLBURN AND CO.'S LIST\r\n#Of Interesting New Works.#\r\n\r\n\r\nFIFTH AND CHEAPER EDITION, REVISED.\r\n\r\nIn One Vol., Post 8vo. 10s. 6d. bound.\r\n\r\nLORD GEORGE BENTINCK,\r\nA POLITICAL BIOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\nBY THE RT. HON. B. DISRAELI, M.P.\r\n\r\nFROM BLACKWOOD'S MAGAZINE.--\"This biography cannot fail to attract the\r\ndeep attention of the public. We are bound to say, that as a political\r\nbiography we have rarely, if ever, met with a book more dexterously\r\nhandled, or more replete with interest. The exertions of Lord George\r\nBentinck in behalf of every assailed or depressed branch of British and\r\nColonial industry--the vast pains which he took in procuring authentic\r\ninformation--and the enormous amount of private labour he underwent in\r\nthe preparation of those materials which have thrown a novel light upon\r\ndisputed doctrines of economy--are faithfully chronicled in this most\r\ninteresting volume. The history of the famous session of 1846, as\r\nwritten by Disraeli in that brilliant and pointed style of which he is\r\nso consummate a master, is deeply interesting. He has traced this\r\nmemorable struggle with a vivacity and power unequalled as yet in any\r\nnarrative of Parliamentary proceedings.\"\r\n\r\nFROM THE DUBLIN UNIVERSITY MAGAZINE.--\"A political biography of Lord\r\nGeorge Bentinck by Mr. Disraeli must needs be a work of interest and\r\nimportance. Either the subject or the writer would be sufficient to\r\ninvest it with both--the combination surrounds it with peculiar\r\nattractions. In this most interesting volume Mr. Disraeli has produced a\r\nmemoir of his friend in which he has combined the warmest enthusiasm of\r\naffectionate attachment with the calmness of the critic, and in which he\r\nhas not only added to his reputation, but we verily believe must\r\nincrease his influence even as a politician.\"\r\n\r\nFROM THE MORNING HERALD--\"Mr. Disraeli's tribute to the memory of his\r\ndeparted friend is as graceful and as touching as it is accurate and\r\nimpartial. No one of Lord George Bentinck's colleagues could have been\r\nselected, who, from his high literary attainments, his personal\r\nintimacy, and party associations, would have done such complete justice\r\nto the memory of a friend and Parliamentary associate. Mr. Disraeli has\r\nhere presented us with the very type and embodiment of what history\r\nshould be. His sketch of the condition of parties is seasoned with some\r\nof those piquant personal episodes of party manoeuvres and private\r\nintrigues, in the author's happiest and most captivating vein, which\r\nconvert the dry details of politics into a sparkling and agreeable\r\nnarrative. But the portrait which will stamp the book as one of the most\r\nextraordinary productions of the time is that of Sir Robert Peel. It is\r\nwritten with wonderful force and extraordinary impartiality.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LIFE OF MARIE DE MEDICIS,\r\nQUEEN OF FRANCE,\r\nCONSORT OF HENRY IV., AND REGENT UNDER LOUIS XIII.\r\n\r\nBY MISS PARDOE.\r\nAuthor of \"Louis XIV. and the Court of France in the 17th Century,\" &c.\r\n\r\nIn 3 large vols. 8vo., with Fine Portraits, 42s. bound.\r\n\r\n\"A fascinating book. The history of such a woman as the beautiful,\r\nimpulsive earnest, and affectionate Marie de Medicis could only be done\r\njustice to by a female pen, impelled by all the sympathies of womanhood,\r\nbut strengthened by an erudition by which it is not in every case\r\naccompanied. In Miss Pardoe the unfortunate Queen has found both these\r\nrequisites, and the result has been a biography combining the\r\nattractiveness of romance with the reliableness of history, and which,\r\ntaking a place midway between the 'frescoed galleries' of Thierry, and\r\nthe 'philosophic watch-tower of Guizot,' has all the pictorial\r\nbrilliancy of the one, with much of the reflective speculation of the\r\nother.\"--_Daily News._\r\n\r\n\"A valuable, well-written, and elaborate biography, displaying an\r\nunusual amount of industry and research.\"--_Morning Chronicle._\r\n\r\n\"A careful and elaborate historical composition, rich in personal\r\nanecdote. Nowhere can a more intimate acquaintance be obtained with the\r\nprincipal events and leading personages of the first half of the 17th\r\ncentury.\"--_Morning Post._\r\n\r\n\"A work of high literary and historical merit. Rarely have the strange\r\nvicissitudes of romance been more intimately blended with the facts of\r\nreal history than in the life of Marie de Medicis; nor has the difficult\r\nproblem of combining with the fidelity of biography the graphic power of\r\ndramatic delineation been often more successfully solved than by the\r\ntalented author of the volumes before us. As a personal narrative, Miss\r\nPardoe's admirable biography possesses the most absorbing and constantly\r\nsustained interest; as a historical record of the events of which it\r\ntreats, its merit is of no ordinary description.\"--_John Bull._\r\n\r\n\"A life more dramatic than that of Marie de Medicis has seldom been\r\nwritten; one more imperially tragic, never. The period of French history\r\nchosen by Miss Pardoe is rich in all manner of associations, and brings\r\ntogether the loftiest names and most interesting events of a stirring\r\nand dazzling epoch. She has been, moreover, exceedingly fortunate in her\r\nmaterials. A manuscript of the Commandeur de Rambure, Gentleman of the\r\nBedchamber under the Kings Henry IV., Louis XIII., and Louis XIV.,\r\nconsisting of the memoirs of the writer, with all the most memorable\r\nevents which took place during the reigns of those three Majesties, from\r\nthe year 1594 to that of 1660, was placed at her disposal by M. de la\r\nPlane, Member of the Institut Royal de la France. This valuable record\r\nis very voluminous, and throws a flood of light on every transaction.

Post 8vo., 31s. 6d. bound.\r\n\r\nThe Baroness d'Oberkirch, being the intimate friend of the Empress of\r\nRussia, wife of Paul I., and the confidential companion of the Duchess\r\nof Bourbon, her facilities for obtaining information respecting the most\r\nprivate affairs of the principal Courts of Europe, render her Memoirs\r\nunrivalled as a book of interesting anecdotes of the royal, noble, and\r\nother celebrated individuals who flourished on the continent during the\r\nlatter part of the last century. Among the royal personages introduced\r\nto the reader in this work, are Louis XVI., Marie Antoinette, Philip\r\nEgalite, and all the Princes of France then living--Peter the Great, the\r\nEmpress Catherine, the Emperor Paul, and his sons Constantine and\r\nAlexander, of Russia--Frederick the Great and Prince Henry of\r\nPrussia--The Emperor Joseph II. of Austria--Gustavus III. of\r\nSweden--Princess Christina of Saxony--Sobieski, and Czartoriski of\r\nPoland--and the Princes of Brunswick and Wurtemberg. Among the\r\nremarkable persons are the Princes and Princesses de Lamballe, de Ligne\r\nand Galitzin--the Dukes and Duchesses de Choiseul, de Mazarin, de\r\nBoufflers, de la Valliere, de Guiche, de Penthievre, and de\r\nPolignac--Cardinal de Rohan, Marshals Biron and d'Harcourt, Count de\r\nStaremberg, Baroness de Krudener, Madame Geoffrin, Talleyrand, Mirabeau,\r\nand Necker--with Count Cagliostro, Mesmer, Vestris, and Madame Mara; and\r\nthe work also includes such literary celebrities as Voltaire, Condorcet,\r\nde la Harpe, de Beaumarchais, Rousseau, Lavater, Bernouilli, Raynal, de\r\nl'Epee, Huber, Goethe, Wieland, Malesherbes, Marmontel, de Stael and de\r\nGenlis; with some singular disclosures respecting those celebrated\r\nEnglishwomen, Elizabeth Chudleigh, Duchess of Kingston, and Lady Craven,\r\nMargravine of Anspach.\r\n\r\n\"The Baroness d'Oberkirch, whose remarkable Memoirs are here given to\r\nthe public, saw much of courts and courtiers, and her Memoirs are filled\r\nwith a variety of anecdotes, not alone of lords and ladies, but of\r\nemperors and empresses, kings and queens, and reigning princes and\r\nprincesses. As a picture of society anterior to the French Revolution,\r\nthe book is the latest and most perfect production of its sort extant;\r\nand as such, besides its minor value as a book of amusement, it\r\npossesses a major value as a work of information, which in the interest\r\nof historical truth, is, without exaggeration, almost\r\nincalculable.\"--_Observer._\r\n\r\n\"Thoroughly genuine and unaffected, these Memoirs display the whole mind\r\nof a woman who was well worth knowing, and relate a large part of her\r\nexperience among people with whose names and characters the world will\r\nbe at all times busy. A keen observer, and by position thrown in the\r\nhigh places of the world, the Baroness d'Oberkirch was the very woman to\r\nwrite Memoirs that would interest future generations. We commend these\r\nvolumes most heartily to every reader. They are a perfect magazine of\r\npleasant anecdotes and interesting characteristic things.

The exhaustless fund of\r\nhumour--quiet, yet rich and racy, and at the same time overflowing with\r\nthe milk of human kindness--which his writings display on one hand, and\r\nthe wonderful knowledge of man's character, in all its countless\r\nvarieties, which they exhibit on the other, have insured for them a\r\nhigh, and honourable, and enduring station in English literature. It\r\nwould be difficult, if not impossible, to arise from the perusal of any\r\nof Mr. Haliburton's performances without having become both wiser and\r\nbetter. His 'English in America' is, however, a production of a yet more\r\nexalted order. While teeming with interest, moral and historical, to the\r\ngeneral reader, it may be regarded as equally constituting a\r\nphilosophical study for the politician and the statesman. It will be\r\nfound to dissipate many popular errors, and to let in a flood of light\r\nupon the actual origin, formation, and progress of the republic of the\r\nUnited States.\"--_Naval and Military Gazette._\r\n\r\n\"Those who wish for an accurate history of the rise of republicanism in\r\nAmerica to its grand development in the United States revolution, will\r\nhere find a narrative that is invaluable for its accuracy, its\r\nimpartiality, its admirable order in arrangement, and that true\r\nphilosophy of statesmanship which can attach to each incident a fitting\r\nmoral, from which every honest politician can derive instruction. The\r\nwork is one equally useful in the double aspect in which it may be\r\nregarded--first, an insight into the causes of past transactions;\r\nsecond, as a warning to guide mankind amid the many perplexing political\r\nquestions of the day.

We hail this book with pleasure; we\r\nconsider it an honour to Judge Haliburton, as by it he has proved\r\nhimself to be a Christian, a scholar, a gentleman, and, in the true\r\nsense of a mis-used word, a patriot. Mr. Haliburton places before us,\r\nfairly and impartially, the history of English rule in America. The book\r\nis not only a boon to the historic student, it is also filled with\r\nreflections such as may well engage the attention of the legislating\r\nstatesman. Mr. Haliburton also shows us the true position of the\r\nCanadas, explains the evils of our colonial system, points out the\r\nremedies by which these evils may be counteracted, that thus the rule of\r\nthe 'English in America' may be something better than a history of the\r\nblunders, the follies, and the ignorant temerity of colonial\r\nsecretaries.\"--_Irish Quarterly Review._\r\n\r\n\r\nSAM SLICK'S NEW COMIC WORK.\r\n\r\nIn 3 vols. post 8vo. 31s. 6d. bound.\r\n\r\nTRAITS OF AMERICAN HUMOUR.\r\n\r\nEdited\r\nBY THE AUTHOR OF \"SAM SLICK,\" &C.\r\n\r\n\"We have seldom met with a work more rich in fun or more generally\r\ndelightful.\"--_Standard._\r\n\r\n\"Those who have relished the racy humour of the 'Clockmaker,' will find\r\na dish of equally ludicrous and amusing Transatlantic wit in the volumes\r\nbefore us.\"--_Herald._\r\n\r\n\"A new book, by the author of 'Sam Slick' causes some stir among the\r\nlaughter-loving portion of the community; and its appearance at the\r\npresent festive season is appropriate. We hold that it would be quite\r\ncontrary to the fitness of things for any other hand than that of our\r\nold acquaintance, the facetious Judge Haliburton, to present to us a\r\nChristmas dish, and call it 'Traits of American Humour.' But even\r\nwithout the recollection of 'Sam Slick' to evoke the spirit of fun\r\nwithin us, we should have been forced to yield to the racy humour of\r\nthese American 'Traits.' Dip where you will into this lottery of fun,\r\nyou are sure to draw out a prize.\"--_Morning Post._\r\n\r\n\"The untravelled European who has not made the acquaintance of Sam\r\nSlick, can have but little knowledge of the manners, customs, humours,\r\neccentricities and lingos of the countless varieties of inhabitants of\r\nNorth America who we are accustomed to conglomerate under the general\r\nname of Yankees. Assisted, however, by Sam Slick's graphic descriptions,\r\nliteral reports, and racy pen-and-ink sketches, gentlemen who sit at\r\nhome at ease, are able to realize with tolerable accuracy the more\r\nremarkable species of this lively family, to comprehend their amusing\r\njargon, to take an interest in their peculiarities of person and speech,\r\nand to enter into the spirit of their very characteristic humours. No\r\nman has done more than the facetious Judge Haliburton through the mouth\r\nof the inimitable 'Sam,' to make the old parent country recognise and\r\nappreciate her queer transatlantic progeny; and in the volumes before us\r\nhe seeks to render the acquaintance more minute and complete.

Yankeeism\r\npourtrayed, in its raciest aspect, constitutes the contents of these\r\nsuperlatively entertaining volumes, for which we are indebted to our\r\nfacetious old friend, 'Sam Slick.' The work embraces the most varied\r\ntopics,--political parties, religious eccentricities, the flights of\r\nliterature, and the absurdities of pretenders to learning, all come in\r\nfor their share of satire; while in other papers we have specimens of\r\ngenuine American exaggerations, or graphic pictures of social and\r\ndomestic life as it is more especially in the ruder districts and in the\r\nback settlements, or again sallies of broad humour, exhibiting those\r\ncharacteristics which form in the country itself the subject of mutual\r\npersiflage between the citizens of different States.

We are also\r\nintroduced for the first time to the warlike mountaineers of Bosnia,\r\nAlbania, Upper Moesia, and the almost inaccessible districts of the\r\nPindus and the Balkan.

The series of hardships endured in traversing these frozen\r\nsolitudes is affectingly told: and once settled down at one of the most\r\nnorthern points of the convict territory, Berezov, six hundred miles\r\nbeyond Tobolsk, the Author exhibits an observant eye for the natural\r\nphenomena of those latitudes, as well as the habits of the\r\nsemi-barbarous aborigines.

The early history of the Merchant\r\nPrince introduces the reader to the condition of Spain under the\r\nInquisition; the portraitures of Scottish life which occupy a prominent\r\nplace in the narrative, are full of spirit; the scenes in America\r\nexhibit the state of the natives of the new world at that period; the\r\ndaring deeds of the Buccaneers supply a most romantic element in the\r\nstory; and an additional interest is infused into it by the introduction\r\nof various celebrated characters of the period, such as Law, the French\r\nfinancier, and Paterson, the founder of the Bank of England.

The series, commencing with the consort of William the\r\nConqueror, occupies that most interesting and important period of our\r\nnational chronology, from the death of the last monarch of the\r\nAnglo-Saxon line, Edward the Confessor, to the demise of the last\r\nsovereign of the royal house of Stuart, Queen Anne, and comprises\r\ntherein thirty queens who have worn the crown-matrimonial, and four the\r\nregal diadem of this realm. We have related the parentage of every\r\nqueen, described her education, traced the influence of family\r\nconnexions and national habits on her conduct, both public and private,\r\nand given a concise outline of the domestic, as well as the general\r\nhistory of her times, and its effects on her character, and we have done\r\nso with singleness of heart, unbiassed by selfish interests or narrow\r\nviews. Such as they were in life we have endeavoured to portray them,\r\nboth in good and ill, without regard to any other considerations than\r\nthe development of the _facts_. Their sayings, their doings, their\r\nmanners, their costume, will be found faithfully chronicled in this\r\nwork, which also includes the most interesting of their letters. The\r\nhope that the 'Lives of the Queens of England' might be regarded as a\r\nnational work, honourable to the female character, and generally useful\r\nto society, has encouraged us to the completion of the task.\"\r\n\r\nOPINIONS OF THE PRESS.\r\n\r\n\"These volumes have the fascination of romance united to the integrity\r\nof history.

The whole work should be read, and no doubt\r\nwill be read, by all who are anxious for information.

She\r\nhas given a most valuable contribution to the history of England, and we\r\nhave no hesitation in affirming that no one can be said to possess an\r\naccurate knowledge of the history of the country who has not studied\r\nthis truly national work, which, in this new edition, has received all\r\nthe aids that further research on the part of the author, and of\r\nembellishment on the part of the publishers, could tend to make it still\r\nmore valuable, and still more attractive, than it had been in its\r\noriginal form.\"--_Morning Herald._\r\n\r\n\"A most valuable and entertaining work.

They\r\nare accessions of value to our books of reference, and few who write or\r\ntalk much about English Peers and English Landed Gentry, can well be\r\nlooked on as safe authorities without a knowledge of the contents of Mr.\r\nBurke's careful compilations.\"--_Athenaeum._\r\n\r\n\r\nBURKE'S HISTORY OF THE LANDED GENTRY\r\n\r\n#A Genealogical Dictionary#\r\n\r\nOF THE WHOLE OF THE UNTITLED ARISTOCRACY OF\r\nENGLAND, SCOTLAND, AND IRELAND:\r\n\r\nComprising Particulars of 100,000 Individuals connected with them.\r\n\r\nIn 2 volumes, royal 8vo, including the Supplement, beautifully printed\r\nin double columns, comprising more matter than 30 ordinary volumes,\r\nprice only 2l. 2s., elegantly bound,\r\n\r\nWITH A SEPARATE INDEX, GRATIS.\r\n\r\nCONTAINING REFERENCES TO THE NAMES OF EVERY PERSON MENTIONED.\r\n\r\nThe Landed Gentry of England are so closely connected with the stirring\r\nrecords of its eventful history, that some acquaintance with them is a\r\nmatter of necessity with the legislator, the lawyer, the historical\r\nstudent, the speculator in politics, and the curious in topographical\r\nand antiquarian lore; and even the very spirit of ordinary curiosity\r\nwill prompt to a desire to trace the origin and progress of those\r\nfamilies whose influence pervades the towns and villages of our land.\r\nThis work furnishes such a mass of authentic information in regard to\r\nall the principal families in the kingdom as has never before been\r\nattempted to be brought together. It relates to the untitled families of\r\nrank, as the \"Peerage and Baronetage\" does to the titled, and forms, in\r\nfact, a peerage of the untitled aristocracy. It embraces the whole of\r\nthe landed interest, and is indispensable to the library of every\r\ngentleman. The great cost attending the production of this National\r\nWork, the first of its kind, induces the publisher to hope that the\r\nheads of all families recorded in its pages will supply themselves with\r\ncopies.\r\n\r\n\"A work of this kind is of a national value. Its utility is not merely\r\ntemporary, but it will exist and be acknowledged as long as the families\r\nwhose names and genealogies are recorded in it continue to form an\r\nintegral portion of the English constitution. As a correct record of\r\ndescent, no family should be without it. The untitled aristocracy have\r\nin this great work as perfect a dictionary of their genealogical\r\nhistory, family connexions, and heraldic rights, as the peerage and\r\nbaronetage. It will be an enduring and trustworthy record.\"--_Morning\r\nPost._\r\n\r\n\"A work in which every gentleman will find a domestic interest, as it\r\ncontains the fullest account of every known family in the United\r\nKingdom.

It cannot fail to be of the greatest\r\nutility to professional men in their researches respecting the members\r\nof different families, heirs to property, &c.

III. and IV., containing \"The Correspondence,\" may be had\r\nseparately, to complete sets.\r\n\r\nThe Diary and Correspondence of John Evelyn has long been regarded as an\r\ninvaluable record of opinions and events, as well as the most\r\ninteresting exposition we possess of the manners, taste, learning, and\r\nreligion of this country, during the latter half of the seventeenth\r\ncentury. The Diary comprises observations on the politics, literature,\r\nand science of his age, during his travels in France and Italy; his\r\nresidence in England towards the latter part of the Protectorate, and\r\nhis connexion with the Courts of Charles II and the two subsequent\r\nreigns, interspersed with a vast number of original anecdotes of the\r\nmost celebrated persons of that period. To the Diary is subjoined the\r\nCorrespondence of Evelyn with many of his distinguished contemporaries;\r\nalso Original Letters from Sir Edward Nicholas, private secretary to\r\nKing Charles I., during some important periods of that reign, with the\r\nKing's answers; and numerous letters from Sir Edward Hyde (Lord\r\nClarendon) to Sir Edward Nicholas, and to Sir Richard Brown, Ambassador\r\nto France, during the exile of the British Court.\r\n\r\nA New Edition of this interesting work having been long demanded, the\r\ngreatest pains have been taken to render it as complete as possible, by\r\na careful re-examination of the original Manuscript, and by illustrating\r\nit with such annotations as will make the reader more conversant with\r\nthe numerous subjects referred to by the Diarist.\r\n\r\n\"It has been justly observed that as long as Virtue and Science hold\r\ntheir abode in this island, the memory of Evelyn will be held in the\r\nutmost veneration. Indeed, no change of fashion, no alteration of taste,\r\nno revolution of science, have impaired, or can impair, his celebrity.\r\nThe youth who looks forward to an inheritance which he is under no\r\ntemptation to increase, will do well to bear the example of Evelyn in\r\nhis mind, as containing nothing but what is imitable, and nothing but\r\nwhat is good. All persons, indeed, may find in his character something\r\nfor imitation, but for an English gentleman he is the perfect\r\nmodel.\"--_Quarterly Review._\r\n\r\n\r\nLIVES OF THE PRINCESSES OF ENGLAND.\r\n\r\nBy MRS EVERETT GREEN,\r\nEDITOR OF THE \"LETTERS OF ROYAL AND ILLUSTRIOUS LADIES.\"\r\n\r\n4 vols., post 8vo, with Illustrations, 10s. 6d. each, bound.\r\n\r\nOPINIONS OF THE PRESS.\r\n\r\n\"A most agreeable book. The authoress, already favourably known to the\r\nlearned world by her excellent collection of 'Letters of Royal and\r\nIllustrious Ladies,' has executed her task with great skill and\r\nfidelity. Every page displays careful research and accuracy. There is a\r\ngraceful combination of sound, historical erudition, with an air of\r\nromance and adventure that is highly pleasing, and renders the work at\r\nonce an agreeable companion of the boudoir, and a valuable addition to\r\nthe historical library. Mrs. Green has entered upon an untrodden path,\r\nand gives to her biographies an air of freshness and novelty very\r\nalluring. The first two volumes (including the Lives of twenty-five\r\nPrincesses) carry us from the daughters of the Conqueror to the family\r\nof Edward I.--a highly interesting period, replete with curious\r\nillustrations of the genius and manners of the Middle Ages. Such works,\r\nfrom the truthfulness of their spirit, furnish a more lively picture of\r\nthe times than even the graphic, though delusive, pencil of Scott and\r\nJames.\"--_Britannia._\r\n\r\n\"The vast utility of the task undertaken by the gifted author of this\r\ninteresting book can only be equalled by the skill, ingenuity, and\r\nresearch displayed in its accomplishment. The field Mrs. Green has\r\nselected is an untrodden one. Mrs. Green, on giving to the world a work\r\nwhich will enable us to arrive at a correct idea of the private\r\nhistories and personal characters of the royal ladies of England, has\r\ndone sufficient to entitle her to the respect and gratitude of the\r\ncountry. The labour of her task was exceedingly great, involving\r\nresearches, not only into English records and chronicles, but into those\r\nof almost every civilised country in Europe. The style of Mrs. Green is\r\nadmirable. She has a fine perception of character and manners, a\r\npenetrating spirit of observation, and singular exactness of judgment.\r\nThe memoirs are richly fraught with the spirit of romantic\r\nadventure.\"--_Morning Post._\r\n\r\n\"This work is a worthy companion to Miss Strickland's admirable 'Queens\r\nof England.' In one respect the subject-matter of these volumes is more\r\ninteresting, because it is more diversified than that of the 'Queens of\r\nEngland.' That celebrated work, although its heroines were, for the most\r\npart, foreign Princesses, related almost entirely to the history of this\r\ncountry. The Princesses of England, on the contrary, are themselves\r\nEnglish, but their lives are nearly all connected with foreign nations.\r\nTheir biographies, consequently, afford us a glimpse of the manners and\r\ncustoms of the chief European kingdoms, a circumstance which not only\r\ngives to the work the charm of variety, but which is likely to render it\r\npeculiarly useful to the general reader, as it links together by\r\nassociation the contemporaneous history of various nations. The\r\nhistories are related with an earnest simplicity and copious\r\nexplicitness. The reader is informed without being wearied, and\r\nalternately enlivened by some spirited description, or touched by some\r\npathetic or tender episode. We cordially commend Mrs. Everett Green's\r\nproduction to general attention; it is (necessarily) as useful as\r\nhistory, and fully as entertaining as romance.\"--_Sun._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LIFE AND REIGN OF CHARLES I.\r\n\r\nBy I.

The position\r\nof various members of his family connecting Horace Walpole with the\r\nCabinet, the Court, and the Legislature--his own intercourse with those\r\ncharacters who became remarkable for brilliant social and intellectual\r\nqualities--and his reputation as a Wit, a Scholar, and a Virtuoso,\r\ncannot fail to render his Memoirs equally amusing and instructive. They\r\nnearly complete the chain of mixed personal, political, and literary\r\nhistory, commencing with \"Evelyn\" and \"Pepys,\" carried forward by\r\n\"Swift's Journal and Correspondence,\" and ending almost in our own day\r\nwith the histories of Mr. Macaulay and Lord Mahon.\r\n\r\n\"These Memoirs form a necessary addition to the library of every English\r\ngentleman.

It connects, in many\r\ninstances, the new with the old nobility, and it will in all cases show\r\nthe cause which has influenced the revival of an extinct dignity in a\r\nnew creation. It should be particularly noticed, that this new work\r\nappertains nearly as much to extant as to extinct persons of\r\ndistinction; for though dignities pass away, it rarely occurs that whole\r\nfamilies do.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n1.
