About \"After the Rain\"\r\n\r\nThe Security Apparatus\r\n\r\nShabtai Kalmanovich vanished from London in late 1980's. He resurfaced\r\nin Israel to face trial for espionage. He was convicted and spent years\r\nin an Israeli jail before being repatriated to Russia. He was described\r\nby his captors as a mastermind, in charge of an African KGB station.\r\n\r\nIn the early 1970's he even served as advisor (on Russian immigration)\r\nto Israel's Iron Lady, Golda Meir. He then moved to do flourishing\r\nbusiness in Africa, in Botswana and then in Sierra Leone, where his\r\ncompany, LIAT, owned the only bus operator in Freetown. He traded\r\ndiamonds, globetrotted  flamboyantly with an entourage of dozens of\r\nAfrican chieftains and their mistresses, and fraternized with the\r\ncorrupt elite, President Momoh included. In 1986-7 he even collaborated\r\nwith IPE, a London based outfit, rumored to have been owned by former\r\nmembers of the Mossad and other paragons of the Israeli defense\r\nestablishment (including virtually all the Israelis implicated in the\r\nill-fated Iran-Contras affair).\r\n\r\nBeing a KGB officer was always a lucrative and liberating proposition.\r\nAccess to Western goods, travel to exotic destinations, making new (and\r\ninfluential) friends, mastering foreign languages, and doing some\r\nbusiness on the side (often with one's official \"enemies\" and\r\nunsupervised slush funds) - were all standard perks even in the 1970's\r\nand 1980's. Thus, when communism was replaced by criminal anarchy, KGB\r\npersonnel (as well as mobsters) were the best suited to act as\r\nentrepreneurs in the new environment.\r\n\r\nThey were well traveled, well connected, well capitalized, polyglot,\r\npossessed of management skills, disciplined, armed to the teeth, and\r\nruthless. Far from being sidetracked, the security services rode the\r\ngravy train. But never more so than now.\r\n\r\nJanuary 2002. Putin's dour gaze pierces from every wall in every\r\noffice. His obese ministers often discover a sudden sycophantic\r\npropensity for skiing (a favorite pastime of the athletic President).\r\nThe praise heaped on him by the servile media (Putin made sure that no\r\nother kind of media survives) comes uncomfortably close to a Central\r\nAsian personality cult. Yet, Putin is not in control of the machinery\r\nthat brought him to the pinnacle of power, under-qualified as he was.\r\nThis penumbral apparatus revolves around two pivots: the increasingly\r\nfractured and warlord controlled military and, ever more importantly,\r\nthe KGB's successors, mainly the FSB.\r\n\r\nA. The Military\r\n\r\nTwo weeks ago, Russia announced yet another plan to reform its bloated,\r\ninefficient, impoverished, demoralized and corrupt military. Close to\r\n200,000 troops are to go immediately and the same number in the next 3\r\nyears. The draft is to be abolished and the army professionalized. At\r\nits current size (officially, 1.2 million servicemen), the armed forces\r\nare severely under-funded. Cases of hunger are not uncommon. Ill (and\r\nlate) paid soldiers sometimes beg for cigarettes, or food.\r\n\r\nConscripts, in what resembles slave labour, are \"rented out\" by their\r\ncommanders to economic enterprises (especially in the provinces).\r\n\r\nA host of such \"trading\" companies owned by bureaucrats in the Ministry\r\nof Defense was shut down last June by the incoming Minister of Defense\r\n(Sergei Ivanov), a close pal of Putin. But if restructuring is to\r\nproceed apace, the successful absorption of former soldiers in the\r\neconomy (requiring pensions, housing, start up capital, employment) -\r\nif necessary with the help of foreign capital - is bound to become a\r\npriority sooner or later.\r\n\r\nBut this may be too late and too little - the much truncated and\r\ndisorientated armed forces have been \"privatized\" and commandeered for\r\npersonal gain by regional bosses in cahoots with the command structure\r\nand with organized crime. Ex-soldiers feature prominently in extortion,\r\nprotection, and other anti-private sector rackets.\r\n\r\nThe war in Chechnya is another long standing pecuniary bonanza - and a\r\nvested interest of many generals. Senior Russian Interior Ministry\r\nfield commanders trade (often in partnership with Chechen \"rebels\") in\r\nstolen petroleum products, food, and munitions.\r\n\r\nPutin is trying to reverse these pernicious trends by enlisting the\r\n(rank and file) army (one of his natural constituencies) in his battles\r\nagainst secessionist Chechens, influential oligarchs, venal governors,\r\nand bureaucrats beyond redemption.\r\n\r\nAs well as the army, the defense industry - with its 2 million\r\nemployees - is also being brutally disabused of its\r\ncentralist-nationalistic ideals.\r\n\r\nOrders placed with Russia's defense manufacturers by the destitute\r\nRussian armed forces are down to a trickle. Though the procurement\r\nbudget was increased by 50% last year, to c. $2.2 billion (or 4% of the\r\nUSA's) and further increased this year to 79 billion rubles ($2.7\r\nbillion) -  whatever money is available goes towards R&D, arms\r\nmodernization, and maintaining the inflated nuclear arsenal and the\r\npersonal gear of front line soldiers in the interminable Chechen war.\r\nThe Russian daily \"Kommersant\" quotes Former Armed Forces weapons\r\nchief, General Anatoly Sitnov, as claiming that  $16 billion should be\r\nallocated for arms purchases if all the existing needs are to be\r\nsatisfied.\r\n\r\nHaving lost their major domestic client (defense constituted 75% of\r\nRussian industrial production at one time) - exports of Russian arms\r\nhave soared to more than $4.4 billion annually (not including\r\n\"sensitive\" materiel). Old markets in the likes of Iran, Iraq, Syria,\r\nAlgeria, Eritrea, Ethiopia, China, India, and Libya have revived.\r\nDecision makers in Latin America and East Asia (including Malaysia and\r\nVietnam) are being avidly courted. Bribes change hands, off-shore\r\naccounts are open and shut, export proceeds mysteriously evaporate.\r\nMany a Russian are wealthier due to this export cornucopia.\r\n\r\nThe reputation of Russia's weapons manufacturers is dismal (no spare\r\nparts, after sales service, maintenance, or quality control).  But\r\nRussian weapons (often Cold War surplus) come cheap and the list of\r\nRussian firms and institutions blacklisted by the USA for selling\r\nweapons (from handguns to missile equipped destroyers) to \"rogue\r\nstates\" grows by the day.\r\n\r\nLess than one quarter of 2500 defense-related firms are subject to (the\r\namorphous and inapt) Russian Federal supervision. Gradually, Russia's\r\nmost advanced weaponry is being made available through these outfits.\r\n\r\nClose to 4000 R&D programs and defense conversion projects (many\r\nfinanced by the West) have failed abysmally to transform Russia's\r\n\"military-industrial complex\". Following a much derided \"privatization\"\r\n(in which the state lost control over hundreds of defense firms to\r\nassorted autochthonous tycoons and foreign manufacturers) - the\r\nenterprises are still being abused and looted by politicians on all\r\nlevels, including the regional and provincial ones. The Russian\r\nFederation, for instance, has controlling stakes in only 7 of c. 250\r\nprivatized air defense contractors. Manufacturing and R&D co-operation\r\nwith Ukraine and other former Soviet republics is on the ascendant,\r\noften flying in the face of official policies and national security.\r\n\r\nDespite the surge in exports, overproduction of unwanted goods leads to\r\npersistent accumulation of inventory. Even so, capacity utilization is\r\nsaid to be 25% in many factories. Lack of maintenance renders many\r\nplant facilities obsolete and non-competitive. The Russian government's\r\nnew emphasis on R&D is wise - Russia must replenish its catalog with\r\nhi-tech gadgets if it wishes to continue to export to prime clients.\r\nStill, the Russian Duma's prescription of a return to state ownership,\r\ncentral planning, and subsidies, if implemented, is likely to prove to\r\nbe the coup de grace rather than a graceful coup.\r\n\r\nB. The FSB (the main successor to the KGB)\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n\r\nThe KGB was succeeded by a host of agencies. The FSB inherited its\r\ninternal security directorates. The SVR inherited the KGB's foreign\r\nintelligence directorates.\r\n\r\nWith the ascendance of the Vladimir Putin and his coterie (all former\r\nKGB or FSB officers), the security services revealed their hand - they\r\nare in control of Russia and always have been. They number now twice as\r\nmany as the KGB at its apex. Only a few days ago, the FSB had\r\nindirectly made known its enduring objections to a long mooted (and\r\ngovernment approved) railway reform (a purely economic matter).\r\nPresident Putin made December 20 (the day the murderous Checka, the\r\nKGB's ancestor, was established in 1917) a national holiday.\r\n\r\nBut the most significant tectonic shift has been the implosion of the\r\nunholy alliance between Russian organized crime and its security\r\nforces. The Russian mob served as the KGB's long arm until 1998. The\r\nKGB often recruited and trained criminals (a task it took over from the\r\nInterior Ministry, the MVD). \"Former\" (reserve) and active agents\r\njoined international or domestic racketeering gangs, sometimes as their\r\nleaders.\r\n\r\nAfter 1986 (and more so after 1991), many KGB members were moved from\r\nits bloated First (SVR) and Third Directorates to its Economic\r\nDepartment. They were instructed to dabble in business and banking\r\n(sometimes in joint ventures with foreigners). Inevitably, they crossed\r\npaths - and then collaborated - with the Russian mafia which, like the\r\nFSB, owns shares in privatized firms, residential property, banks, and\r\nmoney laundering facilities.\r\n\r\nThe co-operation with crime lords against corrupt (read:\r\nunco-operative) bureaucrats became institutional and all-pervasive\r\nunder Yeltsin. The KGB is alleged to have spun off a series of \"ghost\"\r\ndepartments to deal with global drug dealing, weapons smuggling and\r\nsales, white slavery, money counterfeiting, and nuclear material.\r\n\r\nIn a desperate effort at self-preservation, other KGB departments are\r\nsaid to have conducted the illicit sales of raw materials (including\r\ntons of precious metals) for hard currency, and the laundering of the\r\nproceeds through financial institutions in the West (in Cyprus, Israel,\r\nGreece, the USA, Switzerland, and Austria). Specially established\r\ncorporate shells and \"banks\" were used to launder money, mainly on\r\nbehalf of the party nomenklatura. All said, the emerging KGB-crime\r\ncartel has been estimated to own or control c. 40% of Russian GDP as\r\nearly as 1994, having absconded with c. $100 billion of state assets.\r\n\r\nUnder the dual pretexts of \"crime busting\" and \"fighting terrorism\",\r\nthe Interior Ministry and FSB used this period to construct massive,\r\nparallel, armies - better equipped and better trained than the official\r\none.\r\n\r\nMany genuinely retired KGB personnel found work as programmers,\r\nentrepreneurs, and computer engineers in the Russian private sector\r\n(and, later, in the West) - often financed by the KGB itself. The KGB\r\nthus came to spawn and dominate the nascent Information Technology and\r\ntelecommunications industries in Russia. Add to this former (but on\r\nreserve duty) KGB personnel in banks, hi-tech corporations, security\r\nfirms, consultancies, and media in the West as well as in joint\r\nventures with foreign firms in Russia - and the security services'\r\nlatter day role (and next big fount of revenue) becomes clear:\r\nindustrial and economic espionage. Russian scholars are already ordered\r\n(as of last May) to submit written reports about all their encounters\r\nwith foreign colleagues.\r\n\r\nThis is where the FSB began to part ways with crime, albeit hitherto\r\nonly haltingly.\r\n\r\nThe FSB has established itself both within Russian power structures and\r\nin business. What it needs now more than money and clout - are\r\nrespectability and the access it brings to Western capital markets,\r\nintellectual property (proprietary technology), and management. Having\r\nco-opted criminal organizations for its own purposes (and having acted\r\ncriminally themselves) - the alphabet soup of security agencies now\r\nwish to consolidate their gains and transform themselves into\r\nlegitimate, globe-spanning, business concerns.\r\n\r\nThe robbers' most fervent wish is to become barons. Their erstwhile,\r\nless exalted, criminal friends are on the way. Expect a bloodbath, a\r\ngenuine mafia gangland war over territory and spoils. The result is by\r\nno means guaranteed.\r\n\r\nThe Energy Sector\r\n\r\nThe pension fund of the Russian oil giant, Lukoil, a minority\r\nshareholder in TV-6 (owned by a discredited and self-exiled Yeltsin-era\r\noligarch, Boris Berezovsky), this week forced the closure of this\r\ntelevision station on legal grounds. Gazprom (Russia's natural gas\r\nmonopoly) has done the same to another television station, NTV, last\r\nyear (and then proceeded to expropriate it from its owner, Vladimir\r\nGusinsky).\r\n\r\nGazprom is forced to sell natural gas to Russian consumers at 10% the\r\nworld price and to turn a blind eye to debts owed it by Kremlin\r\nfavorites.\r\n\r\nBoth Lukoil and Gazprom are, therefore, used by the Kremlin as\r\ninstruments of domestic policy.\r\n\r\nBut Russian energy companies are also used as instruments of foreign\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\nA few examples:\r\n\r\nRussia has resumed oil drilling and exploration in war ravaged\r\nChechnya. About 230 million rubles have been transferred to the federal\r\nMinistry of Energy. A new refinery is in the works.\r\n\r\nRussia lately signed a production agreement to develop oilfields in\r\ncentral Sudan in return for Sudanese arms purchases.\r\n\r\nArmenia owes Itera, a Florida based, Gazprom related, oil concern, $35\r\nmillion. Itera has agreed to postpone its planned reduction in gas\r\nsupplies to the struggling republic to February 11.\r\n\r\nLast month, President Putin called for the establishment of a \"Eurasian\r\nalliance of gas producers\" - probably to counter growing American\r\npresence, both economic and military, in Central Asia and the much\r\ndisputed oil rich Caspian basin. The countries of Central Asia have\r\ndone their best to construct alternative oil pipelines (through China,\r\nTurkey, or Iran) in order to reduce their dependence on Russian oil\r\ntransportation infrastructure. These efforts largely failed (a new $4\r\nbillion pipeline from Kazakhstan to the Black Sea through Russian\r\nterritory has just been inaugurated) and Russia is now on a charm\r\noffensive.\r\n\r\nIts PR efforts are characteristically coupled with extortion. Gazprom\r\nowns the pipelines. Russia exports 7 trillion cubic feet of gas a year\r\n- six times the combined output of all other regional producers put\r\ntogether. Gazprom actually competes with its own clients, the\r\npipelines' users, in export markets. It is owed money by all these\r\ncountries and is not above leveraging it to political or economic gain.\r\n\r\nLukoil is heavily invested in exploration for new oil fields in Iraq,\r\nAlgeria, Sudan, and Libya.\r\n\r\nRussian debts to the Czech Republic, worth $2.5 billion in face value,\r\nhave just been bought by UES, the Russian electricity monopoly, for a\r\nfraction of their value and through an offshore intermediary. UES then\r\ntransferred the notes to the Russian government against the writing off\r\nof $1.35 billion in UES debts to the federal budget. The Russians claim\r\nthat Paris Club rules have ruled out a direct transaction between\r\nRussia (a member of the Club) and the Czech Republic (not a member).\r\n\r\nIn the last decade, Russia has been transformed from an industrial and\r\nmilitary power into a developing country with an overwhelming\r\ndependence on a single category of commodities: energy products.\r\nRussia's energy monopolies - whether state owned or private - serve as\r\npotent long arms of the Kremlin and the security services and implement\r\ntheir policies faithfully.\r\n\r\nThe Kremlin (and, indirectly, the security services) maintain a tight\r\ngrip over the energy sector by selectively applying Russia's tangle of\r\nhopelessly arcane laws. In the last week alone, the Prosecutor\r\nGeneral's office charged the president and vice president of Sibur (a\r\nGazprom subsidiary) with embezzlement. They are currently being\r\ndetained for \"abuse of office\".\r\n\r\nAnother oil giant, Yukos, was forced to disclose documents regarding\r\nits (real) ownership structure and activities to the State Property\r\nFund in connection with an investigation regarding asset stripping\r\nthrough a series of offshore entities and a Siberian subsidiary.\r\n\r\nIntermittently, questions are raised about the curious relationship\r\nbetween Gazprom's directors and Itera, upon which they shower contracts\r\nwith Gazprom and what amounts to multi-million dollar gifts (in the\r\nfrom of ridiculously priced Gazprom assets) incessantly.\r\n\r\nGazprom is now run by a Putin political appointee, its former chairman,\r\nthe oligarch Vyakhirev, ousted in a Kremlin-instigated boardroom coup.\r\n\r\nForeign (including portfolio) investors seem to be happy. Putin's\r\npervasive micromanagement of the energy titans assures them of\r\n(relative) stability and predictability and of a reformist,\r\nbusinesslike, mindset. Following a phase of shameless robbery by their\r\nnew owners, Russian oil firms now seem to be leading Russia - albeit\r\nhaltingly - into a new age of good governance, respect for property\r\nrights, efficacious management, and access to Western capital markets.\r\n\r\nThe patently dubious UES foray into sovereign debt speculation, for\r\ninstance, drew surprisingly little criticism from foreign shareholders\r\nand board members. \"Capital Group\", an international portfolio manager,\r\nis rumored to have invested close to $700 million in accumulating 10%\r\nof Lukoil, probably for some of its clients. Sibneft has successfully\r\nfloated a $250 million Eurobond (redeemable in 2007 with a lenient\r\ncoupon of 11.5%). The issue was oversubscribed.\r\n\r\nThe (probably temporary) warming of Russia's relationship with the USA\r\nand Russia's acceptance (however belated and reluctant) of its\r\ntechnological and financial dependence on the West - have transformed\r\nthe Russian market into an attractive target. Commercial activity is\r\nmore focused and often channeled through American diplomatic missions.\r\n\r\nThe U.S. Consul General in Vladivostok and the Senior Commercial\r\nOfficer in Moscow have announced that they will \"lead an oil and gas\r\nequipment and services and related construction sectors trade mission\r\nto Sakhalin, Russia from March 11-13, 2002.\" The oil and gas fields in\r\nSakhalin attract 25% of all FDI in Russia and more than $35 billion in\r\nadditional investments is expected. Other regions of interest are the\r\nArctic and Eastern Siberia. Americans compete here with Japanese,\r\nKorean, Royal Dutch/Shell, French, and Canadian firms, among others.\r\nEven oil multinationals scorched in Russia's pre-Putin incarnation -\r\nlike British Petroleum which lost $200 million in Sidanco in 11 months\r\nin 1997-8 - are back.\r\n\r\nTakeovers of major Russian players (with their proven reserves) by\r\nforeign oil firms are in the pipeline. Russian firms are seriously\r\nundervalued - their shares being priced at one third to one tenth their\r\nWestern counterparts'. Some Russian oil firms (like Yukos and Sibneft)\r\nhave growth rates among the highest and production costs among the\r\nlowest in the industry. The boards of the likes of Lukoil are packed\r\nwith American fund managers and British investment bankers.\r\n\r\nThe forthcoming liberalization of the natural gas market (the outcome\r\nof an oft-heralded and much needed Gazprom divestiture) is a major\r\nopportunity for new - possibly foreign - players.\r\n\r\nThis gold rush is the result of Russia's prominence as an oil producer,\r\nsecond only to Saudi Arabia. Russia dumps on the world markets c. 4.5\r\nmillion barrels daily (about 10% of the global trade in oil). It is the\r\nworld's largest exporter of natural gas (and has the largest known\r\nnatural gas reserves). It is also the world's second largest energy\r\nconsumer. In 1992, it produced 8 million bpd and consumed half as much.\r\nIn 2001, it produced 7 million bpd and consumed 2 million bpd.\r\n\r\nRussia has c. 50 billion oil barrels in proven reserves but decrepit\r\nexploration and extraction equipment, and a crumbling oil transport\r\ninfrastructure is in need of total replacement. More than 5% of oil\r\nproduced in Russia is stolen by tapping the leaking pipelines. An\r\nunknown quantity is lost in oil spills and leakage. Transneft, the\r\nstate's oil pipelines monopoly, is committed to an ambitious plan to\r\nconstruct new export pipelines to the Baltic and to China. The market\r\npotential for Western equipment manufacturers, building contractors,\r\nand oil firms is evidently there.\r\n\r\nBut this serendipity may be a curse in disguise. Russia is chronically\r\nsuffering from an oil glut induced by over-production, excess refining\r\ncapacity, and subsidized domestic prices (oil sold inside Russia costs\r\none third to one half the world price). Russian oil companies are\r\nplanning to increase production even further.\r\n\r\nRosneft, the eighth largest, plans to double its crude output. Yukos\r\n(Russia's second largest oil firm) intends to increase output by 20%\r\nthis year. Surgut will raise its production by 14%.\r\n\r\nLast week, Russia halved export duties on fuel oil. Export duties on\r\nlighter energy products, including gas, were cut in January. As opposed\r\nto previous years, no new export quotas were set. Clearly, Russia is\r\nworried about its surplus and wishes to amortize it through enhanced\r\nexports.\r\n\r\nRussia also squandered its oil windfall and used it to postpone the\r\nmuch needed restructuring of other sectors in the economy - notably the\r\nwasteful industrial sector and the corrupt and archaic financial\r\nsystem. Even the much vaunted plans to break apart the venal and\r\ninefficient natural gas and electricity monopolies and to come up with\r\na new production sharing regime have gone nowhere (though some pipeline\r\ncapacity has been made available to Gazprom's competitors).\r\n\r\nBoth Russia's tax revenues and its export proceeds (and hence its\r\nforeign exchange reserves and its ability to service its monstrous and\r\noft-rescheduled $158 billion in foreign debt) are heavily dependent on\r\nincome from the sale of energy products in global markets. More than\r\n40% of all its tax intake is energy-related (compared to double this\r\nfigure in Saudi Arabia). Gazprom alone accounts for 25% of all federal\r\ntax revenues. Almost 40% of Russia's exports are energy products as are\r\n13% of its GDP. Domestically refined oil is also smuggled and otherwise\r\nsold unofficially, \"off the books\".\r\n\r\nBut, as opposed to Saudi Arabia's or Venezuela's, Russia's budget is\r\nbased on a far more realistic price range of $14-18 per barrel. Hence\r\nRussia's frequent clashes with OPEC (of which it is not a member) and\r\nits decision to cut oil production by only 150,000 bpd in the first\r\nquarter of 2002 (having increased it by more than 400,000 bpd in 2001).\r\nIt cannot afford a larger cut and it can increase its production to\r\ncompensate for almost any price drop.\r\n\r\nRussia's energy minister told the Federation Council, Russia's upper\r\nhouse of parliament, that Russia \"should switch from cutting oil output\r\nto boosting it considerably to dominate world markets and push out Arab\r\ncompetitors\". The Prime Minister told the US-Russia Business Council\r\nthat Russia should \"increase oil production and its presence in the\r\ninternational marketplace.\"\r\n\r\nIt may even be that Russia is spoiling for a bloodbath which it hopes\r\nto survive as a near monopoly in the energy markets. Russia already\r\nsupplies more than 25% of all natural gas consumed by Europe and is\r\nbuilding or considering to construct pipelines to Turkey, China, and\r\nUkraine. Russia also has sizable coal and electricity exports, mainly\r\nto CIS and NIS countries. Should it succeed in its quest to\r\ndramatically increase its market share, it will be in the position to\r\ntackle the USA and the EU as an equal, a major foreign policy priority\r\nof both Putin and all his predecessors alike.\r\n\r\nFinancial Services\r\n\r\nAn expatriate relocation Web site, settler-international.com, has this\r\nto say about Russian banks: \"Do not open a bank account in a Russian\r\nbank : you might not see your deposit again.\" Russia's Central Bank,\r\naware of the dismal lack of professionalism, the venality, and the\r\ncriminal predilections of Russian \"bankers\" (and their Western\r\naccomplices) - is offering \"complementary vocational training\" in the\r\nframework of its Banking School. It is somewhat ironic that the\r\ninstitution suspected of abusing billions of US dollars in IMF funds by\r\n\"parking\" them in obscure off-shore havens - seeks to better the\r\ncorrupt banking system in Russia.\r\n\r\nI. The Banks\r\n\r\nOn paper, Russia has more than 1,300 banks. Yet, with the exception of\r\nthe 20-odd (two new ones were added last year) state-owned (and,\r\nimplicitly, state-guaranteed) outfits - e.g., the mammoth Sberbank (the\r\nsavings bank, 61% owned by the Central Bank) - very few provide minimal\r\nservices, such as corporate finance and retail banking. The surviving\r\npart of the private banking sector (\"Alfa Bank\", \"MDM Bank\") is\r\ncomposed of dwarfish entities with limited offerings. They are unable\r\nto compete with the statal behemoths in a market tilted in the latters'\r\nfavor by both regulation and habit.\r\n\r\nThe Agency for the Reconstruction of Credit Organizations (ARCO) -\r\nestablished after the seismic shock of 1998 - did little to restructure\r\nthe sector and did nothing to prevent asset stripping. More than one\r\nthird of the banks are insolvent - but were never bankrupted. The\r\npresence of a few foreign banks and the emergence of non-bank financing\r\n(e.g., insurance) are rays of hope in an otherwise soporific scene.\r\n\r\nDespite the fact that most medium and large corporations in Russia own\r\nlicensed \"banks\" (really, outsourced treasury operations) - more than\r\n90% of corporate finance in 2000-2001 was in the form of equity\r\nfinance, corporate bonds, and (mainly) reinvested retained earnings.\r\nSome corporate bond issues are as large as $100 million (with 18-months\r\nmaturity) and the corporate bond market may quintuple to $10 billion in\r\na year or two, reports \"The Economist\", quoting Renaissance Capital, a\r\nRussian investment bank.\r\n\r\nStill, that bank credits are not available to small and medium\r\nenterprises retards growth, as Stanley Fischer pointed out in his\r\nspeech to the Higher School of Economics in Moscow, in June 2001, when\r\nhe was still the First Deputy Managing Director of the IMF. Last week,\r\nthe OECD warned Russia that its economic growth may suffer without\r\nreforms to the banking sector.\r\n\r\nRussian banks are undercapitalized and poorly audited. Most of them are\r\nexposed to one or two major borrowers, sectors, or commodities. Margins\r\nhave declined (though to a still high by Western standards 14%). Costs\r\nhave increased. The vast majority of these fledglings have less than $1\r\nmillion in capital. This is because shareholders (and, for that matter,\r\ndepositors) - having been fleeced in the 1998 meltdown - are leery of\r\nthrowing good money after very bad. The golden opportunity to\r\nconsolidate and rationalize following the 1998 crisis was clearly\r\nmissed.\r\n\r\nThe government's (frail) attempts to reform the sector by overhauling\r\nbank supervision and by passing laws which deal with anti-money\r\nlaundering, deposit insurance, minimum capital and bankruptcy\r\nregulations, and mandatory risk evaluation models - did little to erase\r\nthe memory of its collusion in the all-pervasive, massive, and\r\nsuspiciously orchestrated defaults of 1998-1999. Russia is notoriously\r\nstrong on legislation and short on its enforcement.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the opaque, overly-bureaucratic, and oligarch-friendly\r\nCentral Bank is at loggerheads with would be reformers and gets its way\r\nmore often than not. It supports a minimum capital requirement of less\r\nthan $5 million. Government sources have gone as high as $200 million.\r\nThe government retaliates with thinly-veiled threats in the form of\r\ninane proposals to replace the Bank with newly-created \"independent\"\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\nViktor Gerashchenko - the current, old-school, Governor - is set to\r\nleave on September 2002. He will likely be replaced by someone more\r\nKremlin-friendly. As long as the Kreml is the bastion of reform, these\r\nare good news. But a weak Central Bank will remove one of the last\r\nchecks and balances in Russia. Moreover, a hasty process of\r\nconsolidation coupled with draconian regulation may decimate private\r\nsector Russian banking for good. This, perhaps, is what the Kremlin\r\nwants. After all, he who controls the purse strings - rules Russia.\r\n\r\nII. The Stock Exchange\r\n\r\nThe theory of financial markets calls for robust capital markets where\r\nbanks are lacking and dysfunctional. Equity financing and corporate\r\ndebt outstrip bank lending as sources of corporate finance even in the\r\nWest.\r\n\r\nBut Russia's stock market - the worst performer among emerging markets\r\nin 1998, the best one in 2001 - is often cornered and manipulated, prey\r\nto insider trading and worse. It is less liquid that the Tel-Aviv Stock\r\nExchange, though the market capitalization of RTS, Russia's main\r\nmarketplace, is up 430% since 1998 (80% last year alone). Bonds climbed\r\n500% in the same period and a flourishing corporate bonds markets has\r\nerupted on the scene. Many regard this surge as a speculative bubble\r\ninflated by the high level of oil prices.\r\n\r\nOthers (mostly Western brokerage houses) swear that the market is\r\nundervalued, having fallen by more than 90% in 1998. Russia is\r\ndifferent - they say - it is better managed, sports budget and trade\r\nsurpluses, is less indebted (and re-pays its debts on time, for a\r\nchange), and the economy is expanding. The same pundits talked the RTS\r\nup 180% in 1997 only to see it shrivel in an egregious case of Asian\r\ncontagion. The connection between Russia's macro and micro is less than\r\nstraightforward.\r\n\r\nWhatever the truth, investors are clearly more discriminating. Both the\r\nNew York Times and The Economist cite the example of Yukos Oil (up\r\n190%) versus Lukoil (up a mere 30%). The former is investor friendly\r\nand publishes internationally audited accounts. The latter has no\r\ninvestor relations to speak of and is disclosure-averse. Still, both\r\nfirms - as do a few pioneering others - seek to access Western capital\r\nmarkets.\r\n\r\nThe intrepid investor can partake by purchasing mutual funds dedicated,\r\nwholly or partially, to Russia - or by trading ADR's of Russian firms\r\non NYSE (10-20 times the US dollar volume of the RTS). ADR's of smaller\r\nfirms are traded OTC and, according to the New York Times, one can\r\nshort sell Russian securities through offshore vehicles. The latter are\r\nalso used to speculate in the shares of defunct Russian firms\r\n(\"shells\") traded in the West.\r\n\r\nIII. Debt Markets\r\n\r\nPerhaps the best judges of Russia's officially minuscule economy\r\n(smaller than the Netherlands' and less than three times Israel's) -\r\nare the Russians. When the author of this article suggested that\r\nRussia's 1998 chaos was serendipitous (in \"Argumenti i Fakti\" dated\r\nOctober 28, 1998), he was derided by Western analysts but supported by\r\nRussian ones. In hindsight, the Russians were right. They may be right\r\ntoday as well when they claim that Russia has never been better.\r\n\r\nThe ruble devaluation (which made Russian goods competitive) and rising\r\noil prices yielded a trade surplus of more than $50 billion last year.\r\nFor the first time in its modern and turbulent history, Russia was able\r\nto prepay both foreign (IMF) and domestic debts (it redeemed state\r\nbonds ahead of maturity). It is no longer the IMF's largest debtor. Its\r\nCentral Bank boasts  $40 billion in foreign exchange reserves. Exactly\r\na year ago, Russia tried to extort a partial debt write-off from its\r\ncreditors (as it has done numerous times in its post-Communist decade).\r\nBut Russia's oft-abused creditors and investors seem to have\r\nsurprisingly short memories and an unsurpassed capacity for masochistic\r\nself-delusion.\r\n\r\nStratfor.com reports (\"Russia Buys Financial Maneuverability\" dated\r\nJanuary 31, 2002) that \"Deutsche Bank Jan. 30 granted Vneshekonombank a\r\n$100 million loan, the largest private loan to a Russian bank since the\r\n1998 ruble crisis. As Russia works to reintegrate into the global\r\nfinancial network, the cost of domestic borrowing should drop.\r\n\r\nThat should spur a fresh wave of domestically financed development,\r\nwhich is essential considering Russia's dearth of foreign investment.\"\r\n\r\nThe strategic forecasting firm also predicts the emergence of a\r\nthriving mortgage finance market (there is almost none now). One of the\r\nreasons is a belated November 2001 pension reform which allows the\r\ninvestment of retirement funds in debt instruments - such as mortgages.\r\nA similar virtuous cycle transpired in Kazakhstan. Last year the\r\nCentral Bank allowed individuals to invest up to $75,000 outside Russia.\r\n\r\nIV. The Bandits\r\n\r\nIn August 1999, a year and four days after Moscow's $40 billion\r\ndefault, the New York Times reported a $15 billion money laundering\r\noperation which involved, inter alia, the Bank of New York and Russia's\r\nfirst Representative to the IMF.\r\n\r\nThe Russian Central Bank invested billions of dollars (through an\r\noffshore entity) in the infamous Russian GKO (dollar-denominated bonds)\r\nmarket, thus helping to drive yields to a vertiginous 290%.\r\n\r\nStaff members and collaborators of the now dismantled brainchild of\r\nProf. Jeffrey Sachs, HIID (Harvard Institute of International\r\nDevelopment) - the architect of Russian \"privatization\" - were caught\r\nin potentially criminal conflicts of interest.\r\n\r\nAre we to believe that such gargantuan transgressions have been\r\ntransformed into new-found market discipline and virtuous dealings?\r\n\r\nPutin doesn't. Last year, riding the tidal wave of the fight against\r\nterror, he formed the Financial Monitoring Committee (KFM). Ostensibly,\r\nits role is to fight money laundering and other financial crimes, aided\r\nby brand new laws and a small army of trained and tenacious accountants\r\nunder the aegis of the Ministry of Finance.\r\n\r\nReally, it is intended to circumvent irredeemably compromised extant\r\nstructures in the Ministry of Interior and the FSB and to stem capital\r\nflight (if possible, by reversing the annual hemorrhage of $15-20\r\nbillion). Non-cooperative banks may lose their licenses. Banks have\r\nbeen transferring 5 daily Mb of encoded reports regarding suspicious\r\nfinancial dealings (and all transactions above 600,000 rubles - equal\r\nto $20,000) since February 1 - when the KFM opened for business. So\r\nmuch for Russian bank secrecy (\"Did we really have it?\" - mused\r\nPresident Putin a few weeks ago).\r\n\r\nLast month, Mikhail Fradkov, the Federal Tax Police Chief confirmed to\r\nInterfax the financial sector's continued involvement in bleeding\r\nRussia white: \"...fly-by-night firms usually play a key role in illegal\r\nmoney transfers abroad. Fradkov recalled that 20 Moscow banks inspected\r\nby the tax police alone transferred about $5 billion abroad through\r\nsuch firms.\" ITAR-TASS, the Russian news agency, reports a drop of 60%\r\nin the cash flow of Russian banks since anti-money laundering measures\r\ntook effect, a fortnight ago.\r\n\r\nV. The Foreign Exchange Market\r\n\r\nRussians, the skeptics that they are, still keep most of their savings\r\n(c. $40-50 billion) in foreign exchange (predominantly US dollars),\r\nstuffed in mattresses and other exotic places. Prices are often quoted\r\nin dollars and ATM's spew forth both dollars and rubles. This\r\npredilection for the greenback was aided greatly by the Central Bank's\r\npanicky advice (reported by Moscow Times) to ditch all European\r\ncurrencies prior to January 1, 2002. The result is a cautious and\r\nhitherto minor diversification to euros. Banks are reporting increased\r\ndemand for the new currency - a multiple of the demand for all former\r\nEuropean currencies combined. But this is still a drop in the dollar\r\nocean.\r\n\r\nThe exchange rate is determined by the Central Bank - by far the\r\ndecisive player in the thin and illiquid market. Lately, it has opted\r\nfor a creeping devaluation of the ruble, in line with inflation.\r\nForeign exchange is traded in eight exchanges across Russia but many\r\nexporters sell their export earnings directly to the Central Bank.\r\nPermits are required for all major foreign exchange transactions,\r\nincluding currency repatriation by foreign firms. Currency risk is\r\nabsolute as a 1998 court ruling rendered ruble forwards contracts\r\nuseless (\"unenforceable bets\").\r\n\r\nVI. The International Financial Institutions (IFI's)\r\n\r\nOf the World Bank's $12 billion allocated to 51 projects in Russia\r\nsince 1992, only $0.6 billion went to the financial sector (compared to\r\n8 times as much wasted on \"Economic Planning\").\r\n\r\nIts private sector arm, the International Finance Corporation (IFC)\r\nrefrained from lending to or investing in the financial sector from\r\nMarch 1999 to June 2001. It has approved (or is considering) six\r\nprojects since then: a loan of $20 million to DeltaCredit, a smallish\r\nproject and residential finance, USAID backed, fund; a Russian\r\npre-export financing facility (with the German bank, WestLB); Two\r\nmillion US dollars each to the Russian-owned Baltiskii Leasing and\r\nCenter Invest (a regional bank); $2.5 million to another regional bank\r\n(NBD) - and a partial guarantee for a $15 million bond issued by\r\nRussian Standard Bank. There is also $5 million loan to Probusiness\r\nBank.\r\n\r\nAnother active player is the EBRD. Having suffered a humiliating\r\ndeterioration in the quality of its Russian assets portfolio in\r\n1998-2000, it is active there again. By midyear last year, it had\r\ninvested c. $300 million and lent another $700 million to Russian\r\nbanks, equity and mutual funds, insurance companies, and pension funds.\r\nThis amounts to almost 30% of its total involvement in the Russian\r\nFederation. Judging by this commitment, the EBRD - a bank - seems to be\r\nregarding the Russian financial system as either an extremely\r\nattractive investment - or a menace to Russia's future stability.\r\n\r\nVII. So, What's Next?\r\n\r\nNo modern country, however self-deluded and backward, can survive\r\nwithout a banking system. The Central Bank's pernicious and\r\noverwhelming presence virtually guarantees a repeat of 1998. Russia -\r\nlike Japan - is living on time borrowed against its oil collateral.\r\n\r\nShould oil prices wither - what remains of the banking system may\r\ncollapse, Russian securities will be dumped, Russian debts \"deferred\".\r\nThe Central Bank may emerge either more strengthened by the devastation\r\n- or weakened to the point of actual reform.\r\n\r\nIn the eventuality of a confluence between this financial Armageddon\r\nand Russia's entry to the WTO - the crisis is bound to become more\r\nominous. Russia is on the verge of opening itself to real competition\r\nfrom the West - including (perhaps especially so) in the financial\r\nsector. It is revamping its law books - but does not have the\r\nadministrative mechanism it takes to implement them. It has a rich\r\ntradition of obstructionism, venality, political interference, and\r\npatronage.\r\n\r\nForeign competition is the equivalent of an economic crisis in a\r\ncountry like Russia. Should this be coupled with domestic financial\r\nmayhem - Russia may be transformed to the worse. Expect interesting\r\ntimes ahead.\r\n\r\nThe Russian Devolution\r\n\r\n The Regions\r\n\r\nRussia's history is a chaotic battle between centrifugal and\r\ncentripetal forces - between its 50 oblasts (regions), 2 cities (Moscow\r\nand St. Petersburg), 6 krais (territories), 21 republics, and 10 okrugs\r\n(departments) - and the often cash-strapped and graft-ridden\r\npaternalistic center. The vast land mass that is the Russian Federation\r\n(constituted officially in 1993) is a patchwork of fictitious homelands\r\n(the Jewish oblast), rebellious republics (Chechnya), and disaffected\r\ndistricts - all intermittently connected with decrepit lines of\r\ntransport and communications.\r\n\r\nThe republics - national homelands to Russia's numerous minorities -\r\nhave their own constitutions and elected presidents (since 1991).\r\nOblasts and krais are run by elected governors (a novelty - governors\r\nhave been appointed by Yeltsin until 1997). They are patchy fiefdoms\r\ncomposed of autonomous okrugs. \"The Economist\" observes that the okrugs\r\n(often populated with members of an ethnic minority) are either very\r\nrich (e.g., Yamal-Nenets in Tyumen, with 53% of Russia's oil reserves)\r\n- or very poor and, thus, dependent on Federal handouts.\r\n\r\nIn Russia it is often \"Moscow proposes - but the governor disposes\" -\r\nbut decades of central planning and industrial policy encouraged\r\ncapital accumulation is some regions while ignoring others, thus\r\nirreversibly eroding any sense of residual solidarity. In an IMF\r\nworking paper (\"Regional Disparities and Transfer Policies in Russia\"\r\nby Dabla-Norris and Weber), the authors note that the ten wealthiest\r\nregions produce more than 40% of Russia's GDP (and contribute more than\r\n50% of its tax revenues) - thus heavily subsidizing their poorer\r\nbrethren. Output contracted by 90% in some regions - and only by 15% in\r\nothers. Moscow receives more than 20% of all federal funds - with less\r\nthan 7% of the population. In the Tuva republic - three quarters of the\r\ndenizens are poor - compared to less than one fifth in Moscow. Moscow\r\nlavishes on each of its residents 30 times the amount per capita spent\r\nby the poorest region.\r\n\r\nNadezhda Bikalova of the IMF notes (\"Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations\r\nin Russia\") that when the USSR imploded, the ratio of budgetary income\r\nper person between the richest and the poorest region was 11.6. It has\r\nsince climbed to 30. All the regions were put in charge of implementing\r\nsocial policies as early as 1994 - but only a few (the net \"donors\" to\r\nthe federal budget, or food exporters to other regions) were granted\r\ntaxing privileges.\r\n\r\nAs Kathryn Stoner-Weiss has observed in her book, \"Local Heroes: The\r\nPolitical Economy of Russian Regional Governance\", not all regions\r\nperformed equally well (or equally dismally) during the transition from\r\ncommunism to (rabid) capitalism. Political figures in the (relatively)\r\nprosperous Nizhny-Novgorod and Tyumen regions emphasized stability and\r\nconsensus (i.e., centralization and co-operation). Both the economic\r\nresources and the political levers in prosperous regions are in the\r\nhands of a few businessmen and \"their\" politicians. In some regions,\r\nthe movers and shakers are oligarch-tycoons - but in others,\r\nbusinessmen formed enterprise associations, akin to special interest\r\nlobbying groups in the West.\r\n\r\nInevitably such incestuous relationships promotes corruption, imposes\r\nconformity, inhibits market mechanisms, and fosters detachment from the\r\ncentre. But they also prevent internecine fighting and open,\r\neconomically devastating, investor-deterring, conflicts. Economic\r\npolicy in such parts of Russia tend to be coherent and efficiently\r\nimplemented. Such business-political complexes reached their apex in\r\n1992-1998 in Moscow (ranked #1 in creditworthiness), Samara, Tyumen,\r\nSverdlovsk, Tatarstan, Perm, Nizhny-Novgorod, Irkutsk, Krasnoyarsk, and\r\nSt. Petersburg (Putin's lair). As a result, by early 1997, Moscow\r\nattracted over 50% of all FDI and domestic investment and St.\r\nPetersburg - another 10%.\r\n\r\nThese growing economic disparities between the regions almost tore\r\nRussia asunder. A clunky and venal tax administration impoverished the\r\nKremlin and reduced its influence (i.e., powers of patronage)\r\ncommensurately. Regional authorities throughout the vast Federation\r\nattracted their own investors, passed their own laws (often in defiance\r\nof legislation by the centre), appointed their own officials, levied\r\ntheir own taxes (only a fraction of which reached Moscow), and provided\r\nor withheld their own public services (roads, security, housing,\r\nheating, healthcare, schools, and public transport).\r\n\r\nYeltsin's reliance on local political bosses for his 1996 re-election\r\nonly exacerbated this trend. He lost his right to appoint governors in\r\n1997 - and with it the last vestiges of ostensible central authority.\r\nIn a humiliating - and well-publicized defeat - Yeltsin failed to sack\r\nthe spectacularly sleazy and incompetent governor of Primorsky krai,\r\nYevgeni Nazdratenko (later \"persuaded\" by Putin to resign his position\r\nand chair the State Fisheries Committee instead).\r\n\r\nThe regions took advantage of Yeltsin's frail condition to extract\r\neconomic concessions: a bigger share of the tax pie, the right to\r\npurchase a portion of the raw materials mined in the region at \"cost\"\r\n(Sakha), the right to borrow independently (though the issuance of\r\npromissory notes was banned in 1997) and to spend \"off-budget\" - and\r\neven the right to issue Eurobonds (there were three such issues in\r\n1997). Many regions cut red tape, introduced transparent bookkeeping,\r\nlured foreign investors with tax breaks, and liberalized land\r\nownership.\r\n\r\nBikalova (IMF) identifies three major problems in the fiscal\r\nrelationship between centre and regions in the Yeltsin era:\r\n\r\n\"(1) the absence of an objective normative basis for allocating budget\r\nrevenues, (2) the lack of interest shown by local and regional\r\ngovernments in developing their own revenues and cutting their\r\nexpenditures, and (3) the federal government's practice of making\r\ntransfer payments to federation members without taking account of the\r\nother state subsidies and grants they receive.\"\r\n\r\nThen came Russia's financial meltdown in August 1998, followed by\r\nPutin's disorientating ascendance. A redistribution of power in\r\nMoscow's favor seemed imminent. But it was not to be.\r\n\r\nThe recommendations of a committee, composed of representatives of the\r\ngovernment, the Federation Council, and the Duma, were incorporated in\r\na series of laws and in the 1999 budget, which re-defined the fiscal\r\ngive and take between regions and centre.\r\n\r\nFederal taxes include the enterprise profit tax, the value-added tax\r\n(VAT), excise, the personal income tax (all of it returned to the\r\nregions), the minerals extraction tax, customs and duties, and other\r\n\"contributions\" . This legislation was further augmented in April-May\r\n2001 (by the \"Federalism Development Program 2001-2005\").\r\n\r\nThe regions are allowed to tax the property of organizations, sales,\r\nreal estate, roads, transportation, and gambling enterprises, and\r\nregional license fees (all tax rates are set by the center, though).\r\nMunicipal taxes include the land tax, individual property, inheritance,\r\nand gift taxes, advertising tax, and license fees.\r\n\r\nThe IMF notes that \"more than 90 percent of sub-national revenues come\r\nfrom federal tax sharing. Revenues actually raised by regional and\r\nlocal governments account for less than 15 percent of their\r\nexpenditures\". The federal government has also signed more than 200\r\nspecial economic \"contracts\" with the richer, donor and exporting,\r\nregions - this despite the constitutional objections of the Ministry of\r\nJustice. This discriminating practice is now being phased out. But it\r\nhas not been replaced by any prioritized economic policies and\r\npreferences on the federal level, as the OECD has noted.\r\n\r\nOne of Putin's first acts was to submit a package of laws to the State\r\nDuma in May 2000. The crux of the proposed legislation was to endow the\r\nPresident with the power to sack regional elected officials at will.\r\nThe alarmed governors forgot their petty squabbles and in a rare show\r\nof self-interested unity fenced the bill with restrictions. The\r\nPresident can fire a governor, said the final version, only if a court\r\nrules that the latter failed to incorporate federal legislation in\r\nregional laws, or if charged with serious criminal offenses. The\r\nwholesale dismissal of regional legislatures requires the approval of\r\nthe State Duma. Some republics insist that even these truncated powers\r\nare excessive and Russia's Constitutional Court is currently weighing\r\ntheir arguments.\r\n\r\nPutin then resorted to another stratagem. He established, two years\r\nago, by decree, a bureaucratic layer between centre and regions: seven\r\nadministrative mega-regions whose role is to make sure that federal\r\nlaws are both adopted and enforced at the local level. The presidential\r\nenvoys report back to the Kremlin but, otherwise, are fairly harmless -\r\nand useless. They did succeed, however, in forcing local elections upon\r\nthe likes of Ingushetiya - and to organize all federal workers in\r\nregional federal collegiums, subordinated to the Kremlin.\r\n\r\nThe war in Chechnya was meant to be another unequivocal message that\r\ncessation is not an option, that there are limits to regional autonomy,\r\nand that the center - as authoritative as ever - is back. It, too,\r\nflopped painfully when Chechnya evolved into a second - internal -\r\nAfghani quagmire.\r\n\r\nHaving failed thrice, Putin is lately leaning in favor of restoring and\r\neven increasing the Federation Council's erstwhile powers at the\r\nexpense of the (incensed) Duma. Governors have sensed the changing\r\nwinds and have acted to trample over democratic institutions in their\r\nregions. Thus, the Governor of Orenburg has abolished the direct\r\nelections of mayors in his oblast. Russia's big business is moving in\r\nas well in an attempt to elect its own mayors (for instance, in\r\nIrkutsk).\r\n\r\nRegional finances are in bad shape. Only 40 out 89 regions managed, by\r\nFebruary, to pay their civil servants their December 2001 salaries\r\n(raised 89% - or 1.5% of GDP - by the benevolent president). Many\r\nregions had to go deeper into deficit to do so. Salaries make three\r\nquarters of regional budgets.\r\n\r\nThe East-West Institute reports that arrears have increased 10% in\r\nJanuary alone - to 33 billion rubles (c. $1 billion). The Finance\r\nMinistry is considering to declare seven regions bankrupt. Yet another\r\ncommittee, headed by Deputy Head of the Presidential Administration,\r\nDimitri Kozak, is on the verge of establishing an external\r\nadministration for insolvent regions. The recent housing reform - which\r\nwould force Russians to pay market prices for their apartments and\r\nwould subsidize the poor directly (rather than through the regional and\r\nmunicipal authorities) - is likely to further weaken regional balance\r\nsheets.\r\n\r\nLuckily for Russia, the regions are less cantankerous and restive now.\r\nThe emphasis has shifted from narcissistic posturing to economic\r\nsurvival and prosperity. The Moscow region still attracts the bulk of\r\nRussian domestic and foreign investments, leaving the regions to make\r\ndo with leftovers.\r\n\r\nSergei Kirienko, a former short lived Prime Minister, and, currently\r\nthe president's envoy to the politically mighty Volga okrug, attributes\r\nthis gap, in a comment to Radio Free Europe, to non-harmonized business\r\nlegislation (between center and regions). Boris Nemtsov, a member of\r\nthe Duma (and former Deputy Prime Minister) thinks that the problem is\r\na \"lack of democratic structures\" - press freedom, civil society, and\r\ndemocratic government. Others attribute the deficient interest to a\r\ndearth of safety and safe institutions, propagated by entrenched\r\ninterest groups.\r\n\r\nSmall business is back in fashion after years of investments in\r\nbehemoths such as Gazprom and Lukoil. Politicians make small to medium\r\nenterprises a staple of their speeches. The EBRD has revived its\r\nmoribund small business funds (and grants up to $125,000 loans to\r\neligible enterprises). Bank lending is still absent (together with a\r\nbanking system) - but foreign investment banks and retail banks are\r\nmaking hesitant inroads into the regional markets. Small businessmen\r\nare more assertive and often demonstrate against adverse tax laws, high\r\nprices, and poor governance.\r\n\r\nRussia is at a crossroad. It must choose which of the many models of\r\nfederalism to adopt. It can either strengthen the center at the expense\r\nof the regions, transforming the latter into mere tax collectors and\r\nlaw enforcement agents - or devolve more powers to tax and spend to the\r\nregions. The pendulum swings. Putin appears sometimes to be an avowed\r\ncentralist - and at other times a liberal. Contrary to reports in the\r\nWestern media, Putin failed to subdue the regions. The donors and\r\nexporters among them are as powerful as ever. But he did succeed to\r\nestablish a modus vivendi and is working hard on a modus operandi. He\r\nalso weeded out the zanier governors. Russia seems to be converging on\r\nan equilibrium of sorts - though, as usual, it is a precarious one.\r\n\r\nRussian Agriculture\r\n\r\nIn  Soviet times, Kremlinologists used to pore over grain harvest\r\nfigures to divine the fortunes of political incumbents behind the\r\nKremlin's inscrutable walls. Many a career have ended due to a meager\r\nyield. Judging by official press releases and interviews, things\r\nhaven't changed that much. The beleaguered Vice-Premier and Minister of\r\nAgriculture of the Russian Federation admitted openly last October that\r\nwhat remains of Russia's agriculture is \"in a critical situation\"\r\n(though he has since hastily reversed himself). With debts of $9\r\nbillion, he may well be right. Russian decision makers recently\r\ncelebrated the reversal of a decade-old trend: meat production went up\r\n1% and milk production - by double that.\r\n\r\nBut the truth is, surprisingly, a lot rosier. Agricultural output has\r\nbeen growing for four years now (last year by more than 5%). Even much\r\nmaligned sectors, such as food processing, show impressive results (up\r\n9%). As the private sector takes over (government procurement ceased\r\nlong ago, though not so regional procurement), agriculture throughout\r\nRussia (especially in its western parts) is being industrialized. Even\r\nstate and collective farms are reviving, though haltingly so. In a\r\nrecently announced deal, Interros will invest $100 million in\r\ncultivating a whopping million acres. Additionally, Russia is much less\r\ndependent on food imports than common myths have it - it imports only\r\n20% of its total food consumption.\r\n\r\nDespite this astounding turnaround - foreign investors are still shy.\r\nThe complex tariff and customs regulations, the erratic tax\r\nadministration, the poor storage and transport infrastructure, the vast\r\ndistances to markets, the endemic lawlessness, the venal bureaucracy,\r\nand, above all, the questionable legal status of the ownership of\r\nagricultural land - all serve to keep them at bay.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the agricultural sector is puny and disastrously inefficient.\r\nHaving fallen by close to half since 1991 (as state subsidies dropped),\r\nit contributes only c. 8% to GDP and employs c. 11% of the active\r\nlabour force (compared to 30% in industry and 59% in services).\r\nAgricultural exports (c. $3 billion annually) are one fourth Russia's\r\nagricultural imports - despite a fall of 40% in the latter after the\r\n1998 meltdown. The average private farm is less than 50 hectares large.\r\nThough in control of 6% of farmland - private farms account for only 2%\r\nof agricultural output.\r\n\r\nMuch of the land (equal to c. 1.8 times the contiguous US) lacks in\r\nsoil, or in climate, or in both. Thus, only 8% of the land is arable\r\nand less than 40,000 sq. km. are irrigated. Pastures make up another\r\n4%. The soil is contaminated by what the CIA calls \"improper\r\napplication of agricultural chemicals\". It is often eroded. Ground\r\nwater is absolutely toxic.\r\n\r\nThe new law permitting private quasi-ownership of agricultural land may\r\nreduce the high rents which (together with a ruble over-valued until\r\n1998) rendered Russian farmers non-competitive - but this is still a\r\nlong way off. In the meantime, general demand for foodstuffs has\r\ndeclined together with disposable incomes and increasing unemployment.\r\n\r\nThe main problem nowadays is not lack of knowledge, management, or new\r\ncapital - it is an unsustainable mountain of debts. Even with a lenient\r\n\"Law on the Financial Recovery of Agricultural Enterprises\" currently\r\nbeing passed through the Duma - only 30% of farms are expected to\r\nsurvive. The law calls for rescheduling current debt payments over ten\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nThe sad irony is that Russian agriculture is now much more viable than\r\nit ever was. Well over half the active enterprises are profitable\r\n(compared to 12% in 1998). The grain harvest exceeded 90 million tons,\r\nfar more than the 75 million tons predicted by the government (though\r\nRussia still imports $8 billion worth of grains a year). The average\r\ncrop for 1993-7 was 80 million tones (with 88 million in 1997). But\r\ngrain output was decimated in 1998 (48 million tons) and 1999 (55\r\nmillion tons).\r\n\r\nLuckily, grain is used mostly for livestock feed - Russians consume\r\nonly c. 20 million tons annually. But by mid 1999, Russian grain\r\nreserves declined to a paltry 2 million tons, according to USDA\r\nfigures. The problem is that the regions of Russia's grain belt\r\nrestrict imports of this \"agricultural gold\" and hoard it. Corrupt\r\nofficials turn a quick profit on the resulting shortage-induced price\r\nhikes.\r\n\r\nThe geographical location of an agricultural enterprise often\r\ndetermines its fate. In a study (\"The Russian Food System's\r\nTransformation at Close Range\") of two Russian regions (oblasts)\r\nconducted by Grigori Ioffe (of Radford University) and Tatyana Nefedova\r\n(Institute of Geography of the Russian Academy of Sciences) in August\r\n2001, the authors found that:\r\n\r\n\"... farms in Moscow Province are more productive than farms in\r\nequivalent locations in Ryazan Provinces, while farms closer to the\r\ncentral city of either province do better than farms near the borders\r\nof that province.\"\r\n\r\nIt seems that well-located farms enjoy advantages in attracting both\r\ninvestments and skilled labour. They are also closer to their markets.\r\n\r\nBut the vicissitudes of Russia's agriculture are of geopolitical\r\nconsequence. A hungry Russia is often an angry Russia. Hence the food\r\naid provided by the USA in 1998-9 (worth more than $500 million and\r\ncoupled with soft PL-480 trade credits). The EU also donated a\r\ncomparable value in food. Russia asked for additional aid in the form\r\nof animal feed in the years 2000-2001 - and the USA complied.\r\n\r\nRussia's imports are an important prop to the economies of its\r\nimmediate and far neighbors. Russia is also a major importer of\r\nAmerican agricultural products, such as poultry (it consumes up to 40%\r\nof all US exports of this commodity). It is a world class importer of\r\nmeat products (especially from the EU), its livestock inventory having\r\nbeen halved by the transition. If it accedes to the WTO (negotiations\r\nhave been dragging on since 1995), it may become even more appealing\r\ncommercially.\r\n\r\nIt will have to reduce its import tariffs (the tariff on poultry is 30%\r\nand the average tariff on agricultural products is 20%). It is also\r\nlikely to be forced to scale back - albeit gradually - the subsidies it\r\ndoles out to its own producers (10% of GDP in the USSR, less than 3% of\r\nGDP now). Privileged trading by state entities will also be abolished\r\nas will be non-tariff obstructions to imports. Whether the re-emergent\r\ncenter will be able to impose its will on the recalcitrant agricultural\r\nregions, still remains to be seen.\r\n\r\nA series of apocalyptic economic crises forced Russian agriculture to\r\nrationalize. Russia has no comparative advantage in livestock and meat\r\nprocessing. Small wonder its imports of meat products skyrocketed. It\r\nis questionable whether Russia possesses a comparative advantage in\r\nagriculture as a whole - given its natural endowments, or, rather, the\r\nlack thereof. Its insistence to produce its own food (especially the\r\nHigh Value Products) has failed with disastrous consequences. Perhaps\r\nit is time for Russia to concentrate on the things it does best.\r\nAgriculture, alas, is not one of them.\r\n\r\nRussia as a Creditor\r\n\r\nBy: Dr. Sam Vaknin\r\n\r\nAlso published by United Press International (UPI)\r\n\r\nRussia is notorious for its casual attitude to the re-payment of its\r\ndebts. It has defaulted and re-scheduled its obligations more times in\r\nthe last decade than it has in the preceding century. Yet, Russia is\r\nalso one of the world's largest creditor nations. It is owed more than\r\n$25 billion by Cuba alone and many dozens of additional billions by\r\nother failed states. Indeed, the dismal quality of its forlorn\r\nportfolio wouldn't shame a Japanese bank. In the 18 months to May 2001,\r\nit has received only $40 million in repayments.\r\n\r\nIt is still hoping to triple this trifle amount by joining the Paris\r\nClub - as a creditor nation. The 27 countries with Paris Club\r\nagreements owe roughly half of what Russia claims. Some of them -\r\nAlgeria in cash, Vietnam in kind - have been paying back\r\nintermittently. Others have abstained.\r\n\r\nRussia has spent the last two years negotiating generous package deals\r\n- rescheduling, write-offs, grace periods measured in years - with its\r\nmost obtuse debtors. Even the likes of Yemen, Mozambique, and\r\nMadagascar  - started coughing up - though not Syria which owes $12\r\nbillion for weapons purchases two decades ago. But the result of these\r\nHerculean efforts is meager. Russia expects to get back an extra $100\r\nmillion a year. By comparison, in 1999 alone Russia received $800\r\nmillion from India.\r\n\r\nThe sticking point is a communist-era fiction. When the USSR expired it\r\nwas owed well over $100 billion in terms of a fictitious accounting\r\ncurrency, the \"transferable ruble\". At an arbitrary rate of 0.6 to the\r\nUS dollar, protest many debtors, the debt is usuriously inflated. This\r\nis disingenuous. The debtors received inanely subsidized Russian goods\r\nand commodities for  the transferable rubles they so joyously borrowed.\r\n\r\nRussia could easily collect on some of its debts simply by turning off\r\nthe natural gas tap or by emitting ominous sounds of discontent backed\r\nby the appropriate military exercises. That it chooses not to do so -\r\nis telling. Russia has discovered that it could profitably leverage its\r\nportfolio of defunct financial assets to geopolitical and commercial\r\ngain.\r\n\r\nOn March 25, Russia's prime minister and erstwhile lead debt\r\nnegotiator, Kasyanov, has \"agreed\" with his Mongolian counterpart,\r\nEnkhbayar, to convert Mongolia's monstrous $11.5 billion debt to Russia\r\n- into stakes in privatized Mongolian enterprises.\r\n\r\nMongolia's GDP is minuscule (c. $1 billion). Should the Russian\r\nbehemoth, Norilsk Nickel, purchase 49% of Erdenet, Mongolia's copper\r\nproducer, it will have bagged 20% of Mongolia's GDP in a single debt\r\nconversion. A similar scheme has been concluded between Armenia and\r\nRussia. Five enterprises will change hands and thus eliminate Armenia's\r\n$94 million outstanding debt to Russia.\r\n\r\nIdentical deals have been struck with other countries such as Algeria\r\nwhich owes Russia c. $4 billion. The Algerians gave Gazprom access to\r\nAlgeria's natural gas exports.\r\n\r\nRussia's mountainous credit often influences its foreign policies to\r\nits detriment. It has noisily resisted every American move to fortify\r\nsanctions against Iraq and make them \"smarter\". Russia is owed $8\r\nbillion by that shredded country and would like to recoup at least a\r\npart of it by trading with the outcast or by gaining lucrative\r\noil-related contracts. The sanctions regime is in its way - hence its\r\napparent obstructionism. Its recent weapons deals with Syria are meant\r\nto compensate for its unpaid past debts to Russia - at the cost of\r\ndestabilizing the Middle East and provoking American ire.\r\n\r\nRussia uses the profusion of loans gone bad on its tattered books to\r\ngain entry to international financial fora and institutions. Its\r\naccession to the Paris Club of official bilateral creditors is\r\nconditioned on its support for the HIPC (Highly Indebted Poor\r\nCountries) initiative.\r\n\r\nThis is no trifling matter. Sub-Saharan debt to Russia amounted to c.\r\n$14 billion and North African debt to yet another $11 billion - in\r\n1994. These awesome figures will have swelled by yet another 25% by\r\n2001. The UNCTAD thinks that Russia intentionally under-reports these\r\noutstanding obligations and that Sub-Saharan Africa actually owed\r\nRussia $17 billion in 1994.\r\n\r\nRussia would have to forgo at least 90% of the debt owed it by the\r\nlikes of Angola, Ethiopia, Guinea, Mali, Mozambique, Somalia, Tanzania,\r\nand Zambia. Russian debts amount to between one third and two thirds of\r\nthese countries' foreign debt. Moreover, its hopes to offset money owed\r\nit by countries within the framework of the Paris Club against its own\r\ndebts to the Club were dashed last year. Hence its incentive to distort\r\nthe data.\r\n\r\nOther African countries have manipulated their debt to Russia to their\r\nfinancial gain. Nigeria is known to have re-purchased, at heavily\r\ndiscounted prices, large chunks of its $2.2 billion debt to Russia in\r\nthe secondary market through British and American intermediaries. It\r\nclaims to have received a penalty waiver \"from some of its creditors\".\r\n\r\nRussia has settled the $1.7 billion owed it by Vietnam last year. The\r\noriginal debt - of $11 billion - was reduced by 85 percent and spread\r\nover 23 years. Details are scarce, but observers believe that Russia\r\nhas extracted trade and extraction concessions as well as equity in\r\nVietnamese enterprises.\r\n\r\nBut Russia is less lenient with its former satellites. Two years ago,\r\nUkraine had to supply Russia with sophisticated fighter planes and\r\nhundreds of cruise missiles incorporating proprietary technology. This\r\nwas in partial payment for its overdue $1.4 billion natural gas bill.\r\nAdmittedly, Ukraine is also rumored to have \"diverted\" gas from the\r\nRussian pipeline which runs through it.\r\n\r\nThe Russians threatened to bypass Ukraine by constructing a new,\r\nRussian-owned, pipeline to the EU through Poland and Slovakia. Gazprom\r\nhas been trying to coerce Ukraine for years now to turn over control of\r\nthe major transit pipelines and giant underground storage tanks to\r\nRussian safe hands. Various joint ownership schemes were floated - the\r\nlatest one, in 1999, was for a pipeline to Bulgaria and Turkey to be\r\nbuilt at Ukrainian expense but co-owned by Gazprom.\r\n\r\nAfter an initial period of acquiescence, Ukraine recoiled, citing\r\nconcerns that the Russian stratagem may compromise its putative\r\nsovereignty. Already UES, Russia's heavily politicized electricity\r\nutility, has begun pursuing stakes in debtor Ukrainian power producers.\r\n\r\nSurprisingly, Russia is much less aggressive in the \"Near Abroad\". It\r\nhas rescheduled Kirghizstan's entire debt (c. $60 million) for a period\r\nof 15 years (including two years grace) with the sole - and dubious -\r\ncollateral of the former's promissory notes.\r\n\r\nRussia has no clear, overall, debt policy. It improvises - badly - as\r\nit goes along. Its predilections and readiness to compromise change\r\nwith its geopolitical fortunes, interests, and emphases. As a result it\r\nis perceived by some as a bully - by others as a patsy. It would do\r\nwell to get its act together.\r\n\r\nThe Space Industry in Eastern Europe\r\n\r\nBy: Dr. Sam Vaknin\r\n\r\nAlso published by United Press International (UPI)\r\n\r\n\"Volga\" is the name of a new liquid-fueled retrievable and reusable (up\r\nto 50 times) booster-rocket engine. It will be built by two Russian\r\nmissile manufacturers for a consortium of French, German, and Swedish\r\naerospace firms. ESA - the European Space Agency - intends to invest 1\r\nbillion euros over 10-15 years in this new toy. This is a negligible\r\nsum in an $80 billion a year market.\r\n\r\nRussian rockets, such as the Soyuz U and Tsiklon, have been launching\r\nsatellites to orbit for decades now and not only for the Russian\r\ndefense ministry, their erstwhile exclusive client. Communications\r\nsatellites, such as Gonets D1 (\"Courier\" or \"Messenger\"), and other\r\ncommercial loads are gradually overtaking their military observation,\r\nnavigation, and communications brethren. The Strategic Rocket Forces\r\nalone have earned more than $100 million from commercial launches\r\nbetween 1997-9, reports \"Kommersant\", the Russian business daily.\r\n\r\nStill, many civilian satellites are not much more than stripped\r\nmilitary bodices. Commercial operators and Rosaviakosmos (Russia's\r\nNASA) report to the newly re-established (June 2001) Russian Military\r\nSpace Forces. Technology gained in collaborative efforts with the West\r\nis immediately transferred to the military.\r\n\r\nRussia is worried by America's lead in space. The USA has 600\r\nsatellites to Russia's 100 (mostly obsolete) birds, according to\r\nspace.com. The revival of US plans for an anti-missile shield and the\r\nimminent, unilateral, and inevitable American withdrawal from the\r\nAnti-Ballistic Missile Treaty add urgency to Russian scrambling to\r\ncatch up.\r\n\r\nDespite well-publicized setbacks - such as the ominous crash at\r\nBaikonur in Kazakhstan in July 1999 - Russian launchers are among the\r\nmost reliable there are. Fifty-seven of 59 launch attempts were\r\nsuccessful last year. By comparison, in 1963, only 55 out of 70 launch\r\nattempts met the same happy fate.\r\n\r\nAmerican aerospace multinationals closely collaborate with\r\nRosaviakosmos. Boeing maintains a design office in Russia to monitor\r\njoint projects such as the commercial launch pad Sea Launch and the\r\nISS. It employs hundreds of Russian professionals in and out of Russia.\r\n\r\nThere is also an emerging collaboration with the European Aeronautic\r\nDefense and Space (EADS) company as well as with Arianespace, the\r\nFrench group. A common launch pad is taking shape in Kourou and the\r\nSoyuz is now co-owned by Russians and Europeans through Starsem, a\r\njoint venture. Russia also intends to participate in the hitherto\r\ndormant European RLV (Reusable Launch Vehicle) project.\r\n\r\nThe EU's decision, in the recent Barcelona summit, to give \"Galileo\"\r\nthe go ahead, would require close cooperation with Russia.\r\n\r\n\"Galileo\" is a $3 billion European equivalent of the American GPS\r\nnetwork of satellites. It will most likely incorporate Russian\r\ntechnology, use Russian launch facilities, and employ Russian\r\nengineers.\r\n\r\nThis collaboration may well revive Russia's impoverished and,\r\ntherefore, moribund space program with an infusion of more than $2\r\nbillion over the next decade.\r\n\r\nBut America and Europe are not the only ones queuing at Russia's\r\ndoorstep.\r\n\r\nStratfor, the Strategic Forecasting firm, reported about a deal\r\nconcluded in May last year between the Australian Ministry of Industry,\r\nScience and Resources and the Russian Aviation and Space Agency.\r\nAustralian companies were granted exclusive rights to use the Russian\r\nAurora rocket outside Russia. In return, Russia will gain access to the\r\nideally located launch site at Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean.\r\nThis is a direct blow to competitors such as India, South Korea, Japan,\r\nChina, and Brazil.\r\n\r\nRussian launch technology is very advanced and inexpensive, being\r\nbased, as it is, on existing military R&D. It has been licensed to\r\nother space-aspiring countries. India's troubled Geosynchronous\r\nSatellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV) is based on Russian technology, reports\r\nStratfor. Many private satellite launching firms - Australian and\r\nothers - find Russian offerings commercially irresistible. Russia -\r\nunlike the US - places no restrictions on the types of load launched to\r\nspace with its rockets.\r\n\r\nStill, launch technologies are simple matters. Until 1995, Russia\r\nlaunched more loads annually than the rest of the world combined -\r\ndespite its depleted budget (less than Brazil's). But Russia's space\r\nshuttle program, the Energia-Buran, was its last big investment in R&D.\r\nIt was put to rest in 1988. Perhaps as a result, Russia failed dismally\r\nto deliver on its end of the $660 million ISS bargain with NASA. This\r\nhas cost NASA well over $3 billion in re-planning.\r\n\r\nThe living quarters of the International Space Station (ISS), codenamed\r\n\"Zvezda\", launched two years late, failed to meet the onerous quality\r\ncriteria of the Americans. It is noisy and inadequately protected\r\nagainst meteorites, reported \"The Economist\". Russia continues to\r\nsupply the astronauts and has just launched from Baikonur a Progress\r\nM1-8 cargo ship with 2.4 tons of food, fuel, water, and oxygen.\r\n\r\nThe dark side of Russia's space industry is its sales of missile\r\ntechnology to failed and rogue states throughout the world. Timothy\r\nMcCarthy and Victor Mizin of the U.S. Center for Nonproliferation\r\nStudies wrote in the \"International Herald Tribune in November 2001:\r\n\"[U.S. policy to date] leaves unsolved the key structural problem that\r\ncontributes to illegal sales: over-capacity in the Russian missile and\r\nspace industry and the inability or unwillingness of Moscow to do\r\nanything about it ... There is simply too much industry [in Russia]\r\nchasing too few legitimate dollars, rubles or euros. [Downsizing] and\r\nrestructuring must be a major part of any initiative that seeks to stop\r\nRussian missile firms from selling 'excess production' to those who\r\nshould not have them.\"\r\n\r\nThe official space industry has little choice but to resort to missile\r\nproliferation for its survival. The Russian domestic market is\r\ninefficient, technologically backward, and lacks venture capital. It is\r\nthus unable to foster innovation and reward innovators in the space\r\nindustry. Its biggest clients - government and budget-funded agencies -\r\nrarely pay or pay late. Prices for space-related services do not\r\nreflect market realities.\r\n\r\nAccording to fas.org's comprehensive survey of the Russian space\r\nindustry, investment in replacement of capital assets deteriorated from\r\n9 percent in 1998 to 0.5 percent in 1994. In the same period, costs of\r\nmaterials shot up 382 times, cost of hardware services went up by 172\r\ntimes, while labour costs increased 82-fold. The average salary in the\r\nspace industry, once a multiple of the Russian average wage, has now\r\nfallen beneath it. The resulting brain drain was crippling. More than\r\n35 percent of all workers left - and more than half of all the experts.\r\n\r\nPrivate firms are doing somewhat better, though. A Russian company\r\nunveiled, two weeks ago, a reusable vehicle for space tourism. The\r\nticket price - $100,000 for a 3-minutes trip. One hundred tickets were\r\nalready sold. The mock-up was exposed to the public in a Russian air\r\nbase.\r\n\r\nAs opposed to grandiosity-stricken Russia, Kazakhstan has few\r\npretensions to being anything but a convenient launching pad. It\r\nreluctantly rents out Baikonur, its main site, to Russia for an $115\r\nmillion a year. Russia pays late, reports accidents even later, and\r\npollutes the area frequently. Baikonur is only one of a few civilian\r\nlaunch sites (Kapustin Yar, Plesetsk).\r\n\r\nIt is supposed to be abandoned by Russia in favor of Svobodny, a new\r\n(1997) site.\r\n\r\nKazakhstan expressed interest in a Russian-Kazakh-Ukrainian carrier\r\nrocket, the Sodruzhestvo. It is even budgeted for in the Russian-Kazakh\r\nspace program budget 2000-2005. But both the Russians and the\r\nUkrainians were unable to cough up the necessary funds and the project\r\nwas put on indefinite hold.\r\n\r\nUmirzak Sultangazin, the head of the Kazakh Institute for Space\r\nResearch, complained bitterly in an interview he granted last year to\r\nthe Russian-language \"Karavan\":\r\n\r\n\"Our own satellite is an dire need. So far, we are using data\r\n\"received\" from US and Russian satellites. Some information we use is\r\nfree, but we have to pay for certain others ... We have high-class\r\nspecialists but they are leaving the institute for commercial\r\nstructures because they are offered several times bigger salaries. I\r\nhave many times raised this question and said: Look, Russia pays us not\r\na small amount to lease Baykonur [some 115m dollars a year], why should\r\nwe not spend part of this money on space research? We could have\r\ndeveloped the space sector and become a real space power.\"\r\n\r\nKazakhstan has its own earth profiling program administered by its own\r\ncosmonauts. It runs biological and physical experiments in orbit. The\r\n\"tokhtar\" is a potato developed in space and named after Kazakhstan's\r\nfirst astronaut, the eponymous Tokhtar Aubakirov.\r\n\r\nAlmost all the former satellites of the USSR have established their own\r\nspace programs after they broke away, vowing never again to be\r\ndependent on foreign good will. Romania founded ROSA, the Romanian\r\nSpace Agency in 1991. Hungary created the Hungarian Space Office.\r\n\r\nThe Baltic states - to the vocal dismay of many of their citizens -\r\nwork closely with NATO on military applications of satellites within\r\nthe framework of BALTNET (the Baltic air space control project). Poland\r\n(1994), Hungary (1991), Romania (1992) and the Czech Republic have been\r\ncooperating with ESA on a variety of space-related commercial and civil\r\nprojects.\r\n\r\nUkraine hedges its bets. It signed with Brazil a space industry\r\nbilateral accord in January. A month later it signed five bilateral\r\nagreements regarding the space industry with Russia.\r\n\r\nMany Western academic institutions, NGO's, and commercial interests\r\ncreated frameworks for collaboration with space scientists from Central\r\nAsia, Central and Eastern Europe, Russia, CIS, and NIS. The University\r\nof Maryland pioneered this trend with its East-West Space Science\r\nCenter, formed in 1990.\r\n\r\nThe space industry - and particularly the emerging field of launch\r\ntechnologies - represents one of the few areas in which the former\r\ncommunist countries may retain a competitive edge and a relative\r\nadvantage. The West would do well to encourage the commercialization of\r\nthis knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe alternative is proliferation of missile technologies and military\r\napplications of technology transferred within collaborative efforts on\r\ncivilian projects with Western partners. The West can save itself a lot\r\nof money and heartache by being generous early on.\r\n\r\nRussia's Vodka Wars\r\n\r\nBy: Dr. Sam Vaknin\r\n\r\nAlso published by United Press International (UPI)\r\n\r\nVodka is a crucial component in Russian life. And in Russian death.\r\nAlcohol-related accidents and cardiac arrests have already decimated\r\nRussian life expectancy by well over a decade during the last decade\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nVodka is also big business. The brand \"Stolichnaya\" sells $2 billion a\r\nyear worldwide. Hence the interminable and inordinately bitter battle\r\nbetween the Russian ministry of agriculture and SPI Spirits. The\r\nlatter, still partly owned by the state, is the on and off owner of the\r\nhaloed brand \"Stolichnaya\", James Bond's favorite.\r\n\r\nSPI's PR firm, Burson-Marsteller, posits this commercial conflict as a\r\nclassic case of the violation of the property rights of hapless foreign\r\nshareholders by the avaricious and ruthless functionaries of an\r\nunreformed evil empire. They question Russia's readiness to accede to\r\nthe WTO and its respect for the law.\r\n\r\nSPI's latest press release consists of the detailed history of this\r\nharrowing tale. The brand Stolichnaya, as well as 42 others, were\r\nprivatized in 1992.\r\n\r\nThe firm quotes a document, bearing the official seal of the maligned\r\nministry, which states unambiguously: \"VAO Sojuzplodoimport has the\r\nright to export Russian vodka to the USA under the following\r\ntrademarks: Stolichnaya, Stolichnaya Cristall, Pertsovka, Limonnnaya,\r\nPrivet, Privet Orange (Apelsinovaya), Russian and Okhotnichya.\"\r\n\r\nThe privatization was completed in 1997 when the old SPI was sold to\r\nthe new SPI Spirits. The new SPI claims to have assumed $40 million in\r\ndebt and invested another $20 million to rebuild the company into \"one\r\nof the world's leading vodka producers\". Yet, the Russian government,\r\nas heavy handed as ever, clearly is unhappy with SPI.\r\n\r\nIt says the privatization deal was dubious and that SPI paid only\r\n$300,000 (or maybe as little as $61,000 claim other sources) for the\r\nmulti-billion dollar brands, including \"Stolichnaya\", \"Moskovskaya\",\r\nand \"Russkaya\". The government values the brands at a far more\r\nreasonable $400 million. Other appraisers came up with a figure of $1.4\r\nbillion.\r\n\r\nThe government, in a bout of new-found legal rectitude, also insists\r\nthat the seller of the brands, the defunct (state-owned) SPI, was not\r\ntheir legal owner. It also questions the mysterious shareholders of the\r\nnew SPI - including a holding company in tax-lenient Delaware. SPI's\r\ntrademarks portfolio is represented by an Australian law firm,\r\nMallesons Stephen Jaques.\r\n\r\nPutin himself set up a committee for the repatriation of these and\r\nother consumer brands to the state. He craves the beneficial effects\r\nthe alcohol sector's tax revenues could have on the federal budget -\r\nand on its powers of patronage. A central state-owned brand-holding and\r\ndistribution company was set up less than two years ago. Ever since\r\nthen, the alcohol sector has been subjected to relentless state\r\ninterference. SPI is not the most egregious case either.\r\n\r\n\"The Observer\" mentions that SPI currently runs most of its business\r\nfrom inscrutable Cyprus, a favorite destination for Russian money\r\nlaunderers, tycoon tax evaders, and mobsters. SPI's German distributor,\r\nPlodimex, is increasingly less active - as three new off shore\r\ndistribution entities (in Cyprus, the Dutch Antilles, and Gibraltar)\r\nare increasingly more so.\r\n\r\nThe FSB ordered Kaliningrad customs to prohibit bulk exports of\r\nStolichnaya. Cases of the drink are routinely confiscated. Criminal\r\ncharges were brought against directors and managers in the firm. The\r\nDeputy Minister of Agriculture is discrediting SPI in meetings with its\r\ndistributors and business partners abroad. He is also accused by the\r\nfirm of obstructing the court-mandated registration of its trademarks.\r\n\r\nThe courts have lately been good to SPI, coming out with a spate of\r\ndecisions against the government's conduct in this convoluted affair.\r\nBut on February 1, the firm suffered a setback, when a Moscow court\r\nruled against it and ordered 43 of its brands, the prized Stolichnaya\r\nincluded, returned to the government (i.e., re-nationalized).\r\n\r\nSPI is doing its best to placate the authorities. It is rumored to have\r\noffered last month to use its ample funds to supplement the federal\r\nbudget. It has indicated last September that it is on the prowl for\r\nadditional acquisitions in Russia - a bizarre statement for a firm\r\nclaiming to have been victimized. \"The Moscow Times\" reported that it\r\nis planning to sign a $500,000 sponsorship agreement with the Russian\r\nOlympic Committee.\r\n\r\nSummit Communications, a country image specialist, placed this on its\r\nWeb site in November last year:\r\n\r\n\"One example of a savvy Russian company that has managed to do well in\r\nthe West by finding the right partner is the Soyuzplodimport company\r\n(see also p. 14). Soyuzplodimport, or SPI, has the exclusive rights to\r\nexport Stolichnaya, which vodka lovers in the U.S. fondly refer to as\r\n'Stoli'. Some 50% of the company's export turnover comes from the\r\nUnited States, thanks mostly to its strategic alliance with\r\nAllied-Domecq for U.S. distribution.\r\n\r\n'I'm not sure that all Americans know where Russia is on the map, but\r\nmost of them know what Stolichnaya is,' muses Andrey Skurikhin, general\r\ndirector of SPI. 'I want the quality of Stolichnaya in America to\r\ncreate an image of Russia that is pure, strong and honest, just like\r\nthe vodka. At SPI, we feel that we are like ambassadors and we will try\r\nto do everything to create a more objective and positive image of\r\nRussia in the U.S.' \"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPI's troubles may prove to be contagious. Allied Domecq, its British\r\ndistributor in America and Mexico, now faces competition from Kryshtal\r\nInternational, a subsidiary of the troubled Kristal distillery, 51%\r\nowned by Rosspirtprom, a government agency. Kryshtal signed\r\ndistribution contracts for \"Stolichnaya\" with distilleries backed by\r\nthe Russian ministry of agriculture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAllied and Miller Brewing have announced a $50 million investment in\r\nproduct launch and marketing campaigns only two years ago.\r\n\"Stolichnaya\" (nicknamed \"Stoli\" in the States) sells 1 million\r\n12-bottle cases a year in the USA (compared to Absolut's 3 million\r\ncases).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe trouble started almost immediately with the first foreign\r\ninvestments in SPI. As early as 1991, Vneshposyltorg, a government\r\nforeign trade agency,  tried to export Stolichnaya in Greece. This led\r\nto court action by the Greeks. Vodka wars also erupted between the\r\nnewly-registered Russian firm \"Smirnov\" and Grand Metropolitan over the\r\nbrand \"Smirnoff\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe vodka wars are sad reminders of the long way ahead of Russia. Its\r\nlegal system is rickety - different courts upheld government decisions\r\nand SPI's position almost simultaneously. Russia's bureaucrats - even\r\nwhen right - are abusive, venal, and obstructive. Russia's\r\n\"entrepreneurs\" are a penumbral lot, more enamored with off-shore tax\r\nhavens than with proper management. The rule of law and private\r\nproperty rights are still fantasies. The WTO - and the respectability\r\nit lends - are as far as ever.\r\n\r\nLet My People Go\r\n\r\nThe Jackson-Vanik Controversy\r\n\r\nBy: Dr. Sam Vaknin\r\n\r\nAlso published by United Press International (UPI)\r\n\r\nThe State of Israel was in the grip of anti-Soviet jingoism in the\r\nearly 1970's. \"Let My People Go!\" - screamed umpteen unfurled banners,\r\nstickers, and billboards. Russian dissidents were cast as the latest\r\nlink in a chain of Jewish martyrdom. Russian immigrants were welcomed\r\nby sweating ministers on the sizzling tarmac of the decrepit Lod\r\nAirport. Russia imposed exorbitant \"diploma taxes\" (reimbursement of\r\neducational subsidies) on emigrating Jews, thus exacerbating the outcry.\r\n\r\nThe often disdainful newcomers were clearly much exercised by the\r\nminutia of the generous economic benefits showered on them by the\r\ngrateful Jewish state. Yet, they were described by the Israeli media as\r\nzealous Zionists, returning to their motherland to re-establish in it a\r\nlong-interrupted Jewish presence. Thus, is a marvelous fiat of\r\nspin-doctoring, economic immigrants became revenant sons.\r\n\r\nCongress joined the chorus in 1974, with the Jackson-Vanik Amendment to\r\nthe Trade Reform Act - now Title IV of the Trade Act. It was Sponsored\r\nby Senator Henry (\"Scoop\") Jackson of Washington and Rep. Charles Vanik\r\nof Ohio, both Democrats.\r\n\r\nIt forbids the government to extend the much coveted \"Most Favored\r\nNation (MFN)\" status - now known as \"Normal Trade Relations\" - NTR -\r\nwith its attendant trade privileges to \"non-market economy\" countries\r\nwith a dismal record of human rights - chiefly the right to freely and\r\ninexpensively emigrate.\r\n\r\nThis prohibition also encompasses financial credits from the various\r\norgans of the American government - the Export-Import Bank, the\r\nCommodity Credit Corporation (CCC), and the Overseas Private Investment\r\nCorporation (OPIC).\r\n\r\nThough applicable to many authoritarian countries - such as Vietnam,\r\nthe subject of much heated debate with every presidential waiver - the\r\nthrust of the legislation is clearly anti-Russian. Henry Kissinger, the\r\nAmerican Secretary of State at the time, was so alarmed, that he flew\r\nto Moscow and extracted from the Kremlin a promise that \"the rate of\r\nemigration from the USSR would begin to rise promptly from the 1973\r\nlevel.\"\r\n\r\nThe demise of the USSR was hastened by this forced openness and the\r\nincreasing dissidence it fostered. Jackson-Vanik was a formidable\r\ninstrument in the cold warrior's arsenal. More than 1.5 million Jews\r\nleft Russia since 1975. At the time, Israelis regarded the Kremlin as\r\ntheir mortal enemy.\r\n\r\nThus, when the Amendment passed, official Israel was exuberant. The\r\nlate Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin wrote this to President Gerald Ford:\r\n\r\n\"The announcement that agreement has been obtained facilitating\r\nimmigration of Soviet Jews to Israel is causing great joy to the people\r\nof Israel and to Jewish communities everywhere. This achievement in the\r\nfield of human rights would not have been possible but for your\r\npersonal sympathy for the cause involved, for your direct concern and\r\ndeep interest.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, to Senator Henry Jackson, one of the two sponsors of the bill:\r\n\r\n\"Dear Scoop,\r\n\r\nThe agreement which has been achieved concerning immigration of Soviet\r\nJews to Israel has been published in this country -a few hours ago and\r\nis evoking waves of joy throughout Israel and no doubt throughout\r\nJewish communities in every part of the globe. This great achievement\r\ncould not have been possible but for your personal leadership which\r\nrallied such wide support in both Houses of Congress, for the endurance\r\nwith which you pursued this struggle and for the broad human idealism\r\nwhich motivated your activities on behalf of this great humanitarian\r\ncause. At this time therefore I would like to send you my heartfelt\r\nappreciation and gratitude.\"\r\n\r\nUS trade policy is often subordinated to its foreign policy. It is\r\nfrequently sacrificed to the satisfaction of domestic constituencies,\r\npressure groups, and interest lobbies. It is used to reward foreign\r\nallies and punish enemies overseas.\r\n\r\nThe Jackson-Vanik Amendment represents the quintessence of this\r\nrelationship. President Clinton tacitly admitted as much when he\r\npublicly decoupled trade policy from human rights in 1994.\r\n\r\nThe disintegration of the Evil Empire - and the privatization of\r\nRussian foreign trade - has rendered the law a relic of the Cold War.\r\nRussian Jews - including erstwhile \"refuseniks\", such as Natan\r\n(Anatoly) Sharansky - now openly demand to rescind it and to allow\r\nRussia to \"graduate\" into a Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR)\r\nstatus by act of Congress.\r\n\r\nAmerican Jews - though sympathetic - would like guarantees from Russia,\r\nin view of a rising wave of anti-Semitism, that Jews in its territory\r\nwill go unharmed. They also demand the right of unhindered and\r\nunsupervised self-organization for Jewish communities and a return of\r\nJewish communal property confiscated by the Soviet regime.\r\n\r\nCongress is even more suspicious of Russian intentions. Senator Gordon\r\nSmith, a Republican from Oregon, recently proposed an amendment that\r\nwould deprive Russia of foreign aid if it passes legislation impinging\r\non religious freedom. Together with Hillary Clinton, a Democrat from\r\nNew York, he introduced a damning Jackson-Vanik resolution, saying:\r\n\r\n\"Any actions by the United States Government to \"graduate\" or terminate\r\nthe application of the Jackson-Vanik Amendment to any individual\r\ncountry must take into account ... appropriate assurances regarding the\r\ncontinued commitment of that government to enforcing and upholding the\r\nfundamental human rights envisioned in the Amendment. The United States\r\nGovernment must demonstrate how, in graduating individual countries,\r\nthe continued dedication of the United States to these fundamental\r\nrights will be assured.\"\r\n\r\nThe Senate still refuses to repeal the Jackson-Vanik Amendment despite\r\nits impact on six former Soviet republics and other countries and\r\ndespite passionate pleas from the administration. On May 22 it passed a\r\nnon-binding resolution calling for PNTR with Russia. Jackson-Vanik\r\nremained in place because of the row with Russia over imports of US\r\npoultry.\r\n\r\nSenator Joseph Biden, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations\r\nCommittee, who represents a major poultry producing state (Delaware)\r\nmade these statesmanlike comments following the session:\r\n\r\n\"I can either be Russia's best friend or worst enemy. They keep fooling\r\naround like this, they're going to have me as their enemy.\"\r\n\r\nMikhail Margelov, Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee of the\r\nFederation Council, understandably retorted, according to Radio Free\r\nEurope/Radio Liberty quoting from strana.ru:\r\n\r\n\"By citing the controversy over chicken legs, the Democrats have openly\r\nacknowledged that Jackson-Vanik does not protect Russian Jews, but\r\nAmerican farmers.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to ITAR-TASS, he presented to President Putin a report which\r\nblamed Russia's \"unstable\" trade relations with the USA on the latter's\r\n\"discriminatory legislative norms.\"\r\n\r\nThe Amendment has been a dead letter since 1994, due to a\r\nwell-entrenched ritual of annual Presidential waiver which precedes the\r\ngranting of NTR status to Russia. The waiver is based on humiliating\r\nsemi-annual reviews. The sole remaining function of Jackson-Vanik\r\nseems, therefore, to be derogatory.\r\n\r\nThis infuriates Russians of all stripes - pro-Western reformers\r\nincluded. \"This demonstrates the double standards of the U.S.\" -\r\nAnatoly B. Chubais, the Chairman of UES, Russia's electricity monopoly,\r\ntold BusinessWeek. \"It undermines trust.\" Putin called the law\r\n\"notorious\".\r\n\r\nIn October last year, the Russian Foreign Ministry released this\r\nunusually strongly-worded statement:\r\n\r\n\"The Jackson-Vanik Amendment has blocked the granting to Russia of most\r\nfavored nation status in trade with the USA on a permanent and\r\nunconditional basis over many years, inflicting harm upon the spirit of\r\nconstructive and equal cooperation between our countries. It is rightly\r\nconsidered one of the last anachronisms of the era of confrontation and\r\ndistrust.\"\r\n\r\nConsidering that China - with its awful record of egregious human\r\nrights violations - was granted PNTR last year, Russia rightly feels\r\nslighted. Its non-recognition as a \"market economy\" under the\r\nJackson-Vanik Amendment led to the imposition of import restrictions on\r\nsome of its products (e.g. steel). The Amendment also prevents Russia\r\nfrom joining the WTO.\r\n\r\nWorst of all, the absence of PNTR also inhibits foreign investment and\r\nthe conclusion of long term contracts. Boeing expressed to the\r\nAssociated Press its relief at the decision to normalize trade\r\nrelations with China thus:\r\n\r\n``Stability is key in our business. We must look 18 to 24 months ahead\r\nin terms of building parts, planes and servicing them. It has been\r\ndifficult for China to make such agreements when they don't know if\r\nthey would have an export license the following year or whether the\r\nUnited States would allow the planes to be delivered.''\r\n\r\nFimaco Wouldn't Die\r\n\r\nRussia's Missing Billions\r\n\r\nBy: Dr. Sam Vaknin\r\n\r\nAlso published by United Press International (UPI)\r\n\r\nRussia's Audit Chamber - with the help of the Swiss authorities and\r\ntheir host of dedicated investigators - may be about to solve a long\r\nstanding mystery. An announcement by the Prosecutor's General Office is\r\nsaid to be imminent. The highest echelons of the Yeltsin entourage -\r\nperhaps even Yeltsin himself - may be implicated - or exonerated. A\r\nRussian team has been spending the better part of the last two months\r\nporing over documents and interviewing witnesses in Switzerland,\r\nFrance, Italy, and other European countries.\r\n\r\nAbout $4.8 billion of IMF funds are alleged to have gone amiss during\r\nthe implosion of the Russian financial markets in August 1998. They\r\nwere supposed to prop up the banking system (especially SBS-Agro) and\r\nthe ailing and sharply devalued ruble. Instead, they ended up in the\r\nbank accounts of obscure corporations - and, then, incredibly, vanished\r\ninto thin air.\r\n\r\nThe person in charge of the funds in 1998 was none other than Mikhail\r\nKasyanov, Russia's current Prime Minister - at the time, Deputy\r\nMinister of Finance for External Debt. His signature on all foreign\r\nexchange transactions - even those handled by the central bank - was\r\nmandatory. In July 2000, he was flatly accused by the Italian daily, La\r\nReppublica, of authorizing the diversion of the disputed funds.\r\n\r\nFollowing public charges made by US Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin as\r\nearly as March 1999, both Russian and American media delved deeply over\r\nthe years into the affair. Communist Duma Deputy Viktor Ilyukhin jumped\r\non the bandwagon citing an obscure \"trustworthy foreign source\" to\r\nsubstantiate his indictment of Kremlin cronies and oligarchs contained\r\nin an open letter to the Prosecutor General, Yuri Skuratov.\r\n\r\nThe money trail from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to Swiss and\r\nGerman subsidiaries of the Russian central Bank was comprehensively\r\nreconstructed. Still, the former Chairman of the central bank, Sergei\r\nDubinin, called Ilyukhin's allegations and the ensuing Swiss\r\ninvestigations - \"a black PR campaign ... a lie.\"\r\n\r\nOthers pointed to an outlandish coincidence: the ruble collapsed twice\r\nin Russia's post-Communist annals. Once, in 1994, when Dubinin was\r\nMinister of Finance and was forced to resign. The second time was in\r\n1998, when Dubinin was governor of the central bank and was, again,\r\nousted.\r\n\r\nDubinin himself seems to be unable to make up his mind. In one\r\ninterview he says that IMF funds were used to prop up the ruble - in\r\nothers, that they went into \"the national pot\" (i.e., the Ministry of\r\nFinance, to cover a budgetary shortfall).\r\n\r\nThe Chairman of the Federation Council at the time, Yegor Stroev,\r\nappointed an investigative committee in 1999. Its report remains\r\nclassified but Stroev confirmed that IMF funds were embezzled in the\r\nwake of the 1998 forced devaluation of the ruble.\r\n\r\nThis conclusion was weakly disowned by Eleonora Mitrofanova, an auditor\r\nwithin the Duma's Audit Chamber who said that they discovered nothing\r\n\"strictly illegal\" - though, incongruously, she accused the central\r\nbank of suppressing the Chamber's damning report. The Chairman of the\r\nChamber of Accounts, Khachim Karmokov, quoted by PwC, said that \"the\r\naudits performed by the Chamber revealed no serious procedural breaches\r\nin the bank's performance.\"\r\n\r\nBut Nikolai Gonchar, a Duma Deputy and member of its Budget Committee,\r\ncame close to branding both as liars when he said that he read a copy\r\nof the Audit Chamber report and that it found that central bank funds\r\nwere siphoned off to commercial accounts in foreign banks.\r\n\r\nThe Moscow Times cited a second Audit Chamber report which revealed\r\nthat the central bank was simultaneously selling dollars for rubles and\r\nextending ruble loans to a few well-connected commercial banks, thus\r\nsubsidizing their dollar purchases. The central bank went as far as\r\nprinting rubles to fuel this lucrative arbitrage. The dollars came from\r\nIMF disbursements.\r\n\r\nRadio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, based on its own sources and an\r\narticle in the Russian weekly \"Novaya Gazeta\", claims that half the\r\nmoney was almost instantly diverted to shell companies in Sydney and\r\nLondon. The other half was mostly transferred to the Bank of New York\r\nand to Credit Suisse.\r\n\r\nWhy were additional IMF funds transferred to a chaotic Russia, despite\r\nwarnings by many and a testimony by a Russian official that previous\r\ntranches were squandered? Moreover, why was the money sent to the\r\nCentral Bank, then embroiled in a growing scandal over the manipulation\r\nof treasury bills, known as GKO's and other debt instruments, the OFZ's\r\n- and not to the Ministry of Finance, the beneficiary of all prior\r\ntransfers? The central bank did act as MinFin's agent - but\r\ncircumstances were unusual, to say the least.\r\n\r\nThere isn't enough to connect the IMF funds with the money laundering\r\naffair that engulfed the Bank of New York a year later to the day, in\r\nAugust 1999 - though several of the personalities straddled the divide\r\nbetween the bank and its clients. Swiss efforts to establish a firm\r\nlinkage failed as did their attempt to implicate several banks in the\r\nItalian canton of Ticino. The Swiss - in collaboration with half a\r\ndozen national investigation bureaus, including the FBI - were more\r\nsuccessful in Italy proper, where they were able to apprehend a few\r\ndozen suspects in an elaborate undercover operation.\r\n\r\nFIMACO's name emerged rather early in the swirl of rumors and denials.\r\nAt the IMF's behest, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) was commissioned by\r\nRussia's central bank to investigate the relationship between the\r\nRussian central bank and its Channel Islands offshoot, Financial\r\nManagement Company Limited, immediately when the accusations surfaced.\r\n\r\nSkuratov unearthed $50 billion in transfers of the nation's hard\r\ncurrency reserves from the central bank to FIMACO, which was\r\nmajority-owned by Eurobank, the central bank's Paris-based daughter\r\ncompany. According to PwC, Eurobank was 23 percent owned by \"Russian\r\ncompanies and private individuals\".\r\n\r\nDubinin and his successor, Gerashchenko, admit that FIMACO was used to\r\nconceal Russia's assets from its unrelenting creditors, notably the\r\nGeneva-based Mr. Nessim Gaon, whose companies sued Russia for $600\r\nmillion. Gaon succeeded to freeze Russian accounts in Switzerland and\r\nLuxemburg in 1993. PwC alerted the IMF to this pernicious practice, but\r\nto no avail.\r\n\r\nMoreover, FIMACO paid exorbitant management fees to self-liquidating\r\nentities, used funds to fuel the speculative GKO market, disbursed\r\nnon-reported profits from its activities, through \"trust companies\", to\r\nRussian subjects, such as schools, hospitals, and charities - and, in\r\ngeneral, transformed itself into a mammoth slush fund and source of\r\npatronage. Russia admitted to lying to the IMF in 1996. It misstated\r\nits reserves by $1 billion.\r\n\r\nSome of the money probably financed the fantastic salaries of Dubinin\r\nand his senior functionaries. He earned $240,000 in 1997 - when the\r\naverage annual salary in Russia was less than $2000 and when Alan\r\nGreenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve of the USA, earned barely\r\nhalf as much.\r\n\r\nFormer Minister of Finance, Boris Fedorov, asked the governor of the\r\ncentral bank and the prime minister in 1993 to disclose how were the\r\ncountry's foreign exchange reserves being invested. He was told to mind\r\nhis own business. To Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty he said, six years\r\nlater, that various central bank schemes were set up to \"allow friends\r\nto earn handsome profits ... They allowed friends to make profits\r\nbecause when companies are created without any risk, and billions of\r\ndollars are transferred, somebody takes a (quite big) commission ... a\r\nminimum of tens of millions of dollars. The question is: Who received\r\nthese commissions? Was this money repatriated to the country in the\r\nform of dividends?\"\r\n\r\nDubinin's vehement denials of FIMACO's involvement in the GKO market\r\nare disingenuous. Close to half of all foreign investment in the\r\nmoney-spinning market for Russian domestic bonds were placed through\r\nFIMACO's nominal parent company, Eurobank and, possibly, through its\r\nsubsidiary, co-owned with FIMACO, Eurofinance Bank.\r\n\r\nNor is Dubinin more credible when he denies that profits and\r\ncommissions were accrued in FIMACO and then drained off. FIMACO's\r\ninvestment management agreement with Eurobank, signed in 1993, entitled\r\nit to 0.06 percent of the managed funds per quarter.\r\n\r\nEven accepting the central banker's ludicrous insistence that the\r\nbalance never exceeded $1.4 billion - FIMACO would have earned $3.5\r\nmillion per annum from management fees alone - investment profits and\r\nbrokerage fees notwithstanding. Even Eurobank's president at the time,\r\nAndrei Movchan, conceded that FIMACO earned $1.7 million in management\r\nfees.\r\n\r\nThe IMF insisted that the PwC reports exonerated all the participants.\r\nIt is, therefore, surprising and alarming to find that the online\r\ncopies of these documents, previously made available on the IMF's Web\r\nsite, were \"Removed September 30, 1999 at the request of\r\nPricewaterhouseCoopers\".\r\n\r\nThe cover of the main report carried a disclaimer that it was based on\r\nprocedures dictated by the central bank and \"... consequently, we (PwC)\r\nmake no representation regarding the sufficiency of the procedures\r\ndescribed below ... The report is based solely on financial and other\r\ninformation provided by, and discussions with, the persons set out in\r\nthe report. The accuracy and completeness of the information on which\r\nthe report is based is the sole responsibility of those persons. ...\r\nPricewaterhouseCoopers have not carried out any verification work which\r\nmay be construed to represent audit procedures ... We have not been\r\nprovided access to Ost West Handelsbank (the recipient of a large part\r\nof the $4.8 IMF tranche)\"\r\n\r\nThe scandal may have hastened the untimely departure of the IMF's\r\nManaging Director at the time, Michel Camdessus, though this was never\r\nofficially acknowledged. The US Congress was reluctant to augment the\r\nFund's resources in view of its controversial handling of the Asian and\r\nRussian crises and contagion.\r\n\r\nThis reluctance persisted well into the new millennium. A congressional\r\ndelegation, headed by James Leach (R, Iowa), Chairman of the Banking\r\nand Financial Services Committee, visited Russia in April 2000,\r\naccompanied by the FBI, to investigate the persistent contentions about\r\nthe misappropriation of IMF funds.\r\n\r\nCamdessus himself went out of his way to defend his record and reacted\r\nin an unprecedented manner to the allegations. In a letter to Le Mond,\r\ndated August 18, 1999 - and still posted on the IMF's Web site, three\r\nyears later - he wrote, inadvertently admitting to serious\r\nmismanagement:\r\n\r\n\"I wish to express my indignation at the false statements, allegations,\r\nand insinuations contained in the articles and editorial commentary\r\nappearing in Le Monde on August 6, 8, and 9 on the content of the\r\nPricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC) audit report relating to the operations of\r\nthe Central Bank of Russia and its subsidiary, FIMACO.\r\n\r\nYour readers will be shocked to learn that the report in question,\r\nrequested and made public at the initiative of the IMF ... (concludes\r\nthat) no misuse of funds has been proven, and the report does not\r\ncriticize the IMF's behavior ... I would also point out that your\r\nrepresentation of the IMF's knowledge and actions is misleading. We did\r\nknow that part of the reserves of the Central Bank of Russia was held\r\nin foreign subsidiaries, which is not an illegal practice; however, we\r\ndid not learn of FIMACO's activities until this year--because the audit\r\nreports for 1993 and 1994 were not provided to us by the Central Bank\r\nof Russia.\r\n\r\nThe IMF, when apprised of the possible range of FIMACO activities,\r\ninformed the Russian authorities that it would not resume lending to\r\nRussia until a report on these activities was available for review by\r\nthe IMF and corrective actions had been agreed as needed ... I would\r\nadd that what the IMF objected to in FIMACO's operations extends well\r\nbeyond the misrepresentation of Russia's international reserves in\r\nmid-1996 and includes several other instances where transactions\r\nthrough it had resulted in a misleading representation of the reserves\r\nand of monetary and exchange policies. These include loans to Russian\r\ncommercial banks and investments in the GKO market.\"\r\n\r\nNo one accepted - or accepts - the IMF's convoluted post-facto\r\n\"clarifications\" at face value. Nor was Dubinin's tortured sophistry -\r\nIMF funds cease to be IMF funds when they are transferred from the\r\nMinistry of Finance to the central bank - countenanced.\r\n\r\nEven the compromised office of the Russian Prosecutor-General urged\r\nRussian officials, as late as July 2000, to re-open the investigation\r\nregarding the diversion of the funds. The IMF dismissed this sudden\r\nburst of rectitude as the rehashing of old stories. But Western\r\nofficials - interviews by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty - begged to\r\ndiffer.\r\n\r\nYuri Skuratov, the former Prosecutor-General, ousted for undue\r\ndiligence, wrote in a book he published two years ago, that only c.\r\n$500 million of the $4.8 were ever used to stabilize the ruble. Even\r\nGeorge Bush Jr., when still a presidential candidate accused Russia's\r\nformer Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin of complicity in embezzling\r\nIMF funds. Chernomyrdin threatened to sue.\r\n\r\nThe rot may run even deeper. The Geneva daily \"Le Temps\", which has\r\nbeen following the affair relentlessly, accused, two years ago, Roman\r\nAbramovich, a Yeltsin-era oligarch and a member of the board of\r\ndirectors of Sibneft, of colluding with Runicom, Sibneft's trading arm,\r\nto misappropriate IMF funds. Swiss prosecutors raided Runicom's offices\r\njust one day after Russian Tax Police raided Sibneft's Moscow\r\nheadquarters.\r\n\r\nAbsconding with IMF funds seemed to have been a pattern of behavior\r\nduring Yeltsin's venal regime. The columnist Bradley Cook recounts how\r\nAldrich Ames, the mole within the CIA, \"was told by his Russian control\r\nofficer during their last meeting, in November 1993, that the $130,000\r\nin fresh $100 bills that he was being bribed with had come directly\r\nfrom IMF loans.\" Venyamin Sokolov, who headed the Audit Chamber prior\r\nto Sergei Stepashin, informed the US Senate of $2 billion that\r\nevaporated from the coffers of the central bank in 1995.\r\n\r\nEven the IMF reluctantly admits:\r\n\r\n\"Capital transferred abroad from Russia may represent such legal\r\nactivities as exports, or illegal sources. But it is impossible to\r\ndetermine whether specific capital flows from Russia-legal or\r\nillegal-come from a particular inflow, such as IMF loans or export\r\nearnings. To put the scale of IMF lending to Russia into perspective,\r\nRussia's exports of goods and services averaged about $80 billion a\r\nyear in recent years, which is over 25 times the average annual\r\ndisbursement from the IMF since 1992.\"\r\n\r\nThe Chechen Theatre Ticket\r\n\r\nBy: Dr. Sam Vaknin\r\n\r\nAlso published by United Press International (UPI)\r\n\r\nOne hundred and eighteen hostages and 50 of their captors died in the\r\nheavy handed storming of the theatre occupied by Chechen terrorists\r\nfour days ago. This has been only the latest in a series of escalating\r\ncosts in a war officially terminated in 1997. On August 22, a\r\nhelicopter carrying 115 Russian servicemen and unauthorized civilians\r\nwent down in flames.\r\n\r\nThe Russian military is stretched to its limits. Munitions and spare\r\nparts are in short supply. The defense industry shrunk violently\r\nfollowing the implosion of the USSR. Restarting production of\r\nsmall-ticket items is prohibitively expensive. Even bigger weapon\r\nsystems are antiquated. A committee appointed by the Duma, Russia's\r\nlower house of parliament, found that the average age of the army's\r\nhelicopters is 20. Russia lost dozens of them hitherto and does not\r\nhave the wherewithal to replace them.\r\n\r\nThe Russian command acknowledges 3000 fatalities and 8000 wounded but\r\nthe numbers are probably way higher. The Committee of Soldiers' Mothers\r\npegs the number of casualties at 12-13,000. Unpaid, disgruntled, and\r\nunder-supplied troops exert pressure on their headquarters to\r\nair-strafe Chechnya, to withdraw, or to multiply the money budgeted to\r\nsupport the ill-fated operation.\r\n\r\nRussia maintains c. 100,000 troops in Chechnya, including 40,000 active\r\nsoldiers and 60,000 support and logistics personnel. The price tag is\r\nsizable though not unsustainable. As early as October 1999, the IMF\r\ntold Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty: \"Yes, we're concerned that it\r\ncould undermine the progress in improving (Russia's) public finances.\"\r\n\r\nAs they did in the first Chechen conflict in 1994-6, both the IMF and\r\nthe World Bank reluctantly kept lending billions to Russia throughout\r\nthe current round of devastation. A $4.5 billion arrangement was signed\r\nwith Russia in July 1999. Though earmarked, funds are fungible. The IMF\r\nhas been accused by senior economists, such as Jeffrey Sachs and\r\nMarshall Goldman, of financing the Russian war effort against the tiny\r\nrepublic and its 1.5 million destitute or internally displaced\r\ncitizens. Even the staid Jane's World Armies concurred.\r\n\r\nNo one knows how much the war has cost Russia hitherto. It is mostly\r\nfinanced from off-budget clandestine bank accounts owned and managed by\r\nthe Kremlin, the military, and the security services. Miriam Lanskoy,\r\nProgram Manager at the Institute for the Study of Conflict, Ideology\r\nand Policy at Boston University, estimated for \"NIS Observed\" and \"The\r\nAnalyst\" that Russia has spent, by November 2001, c. $8 billion on the\r\nwar, money sorely needed to modernize its army and maintain its\r\npresence overseas.\r\n\r\nRussia was forced to close, post haste, bases in Vietnam and Cuba, two\r\nerstwhile pillars of its geopolitical and geostrategic presence. It was\r\ntoo feeble to capitalize on its massive, multi-annual assistance to the\r\nAfghan Northern Alliance in both arms and manpower. The USA\r\neffortlessly reaped the fruits of this continuous Russian support and\r\nestablished a presence in central Asia which Russia will find\r\nimpossible to dislodge.\r\n\r\nThe Christian Science Monitor has pegged the cost of each month in the\r\nfirst three months of offensive against the separatists at $500\r\nmillion. This guesstimate is supported by the Russians but not by Digby\r\nWaller, an economist at the International Institute for Strategic\r\nStudies (IISS), a London-based military think tank. He put the real,\r\nout-of-pocket expense at $110 million a month. Other experts offer\r\ncomparable figures - $100-150 a month.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, Jane's Defense Weekly put the outlay at $40-50 million a day\r\n- but most of it in cost-free munitions produced during Soviet times. A\r\nleading Soviet military analyst, Pavel Felgengauer, itemized the\r\nexpenditures. The largest articles are transport, fuel, reconstruction\r\nof areas shattered by warfare, and active duty bonuses to soldiers.\r\n\r\nThe expense of this brawl exceed the previous scuffle's. The first\r\nChechen war is estimated to have cost at most $5.5 billion and probably\r\nbetween $1.3 and $2.6 billion. Russia allocated c. $1 billion to the\r\nwar in its 2000 budget. Another $263 million were funded partly by\r\nRussia's behemoth electricity utility, UES. Still, these figures are\r\nmisleading underestimates.\r\n\r\nAccording too the Rosbalt News Agency, last year, for instance, Russia\r\nwas slated to spend c. $516 million on rebuilding Chechnya - but only\r\n$158 million of these resources made it to the budget.\r\n\r\nRussia has been lucky to enjoy a serendipitous confluence of an\r\nexport-enhancing and import-depressing depreciated currency,\r\ntax-augmenting inflation, soaring oil prices, and Western largesse. It\r\nis also a major producer and exporter of weapons. Chechnya serves as\r\ntesting grounds where proud designers and trigger-craving generals can\r\ndemonstrate the advantages and capabilities of their latest materiel.\r\n\r\nSome - like the Institute of Global Issues - say that the war in\r\nChechnya has fully self-financed by reviving the military-industrial\r\ncomplex and adding billions to Russia's exports of armaments. This\r\nsurely is a wild hyperbole. Chechnya - a potentially oil-rich territory\r\n- is razed to dust.\r\n\r\nRussia is ensnared in an ever-escalating cycle of violence and futile\r\nretaliation. Its society is gradually militarized and desensitized to\r\nhuman rights abuses. Corruption is rampant. Russia's Accounting Board\r\ndisclosed that a whopping 12 percent of the money earmarked to fight\r\nthe war two years ago has vanished without a trace.\r\n\r\nAbout $45 million dollars in salaries never reached their intended\r\nrecipients - the soldiers in the field. Top brass set up oil drilling\r\noperations in the ravaged territory.\r\n\r\nThey are said by Rosbalt and \"The Economist\" to be extracting up to\r\n2000 tons daily - double the amount the state hauls.\r\n\r\nAnother 7000 tons go up in smoke due to incompetence and faulty\r\nequipment. There are 60 oil wells in Grozny alone. Hence the\r\npredilection to pursue the war as leisurely - and profitably - as\r\npossible. Often in cahoots with their ostensible oppressors,\r\ndispossessed and dislocated Chechens export crime and mayhem to\r\nRussia's main cities.\r\n\r\nThe war is a colossal misallocation of scarce economic resources and an\r\nopportunity squandered. Russia should have used the windfall to\r\nreinvent itself - revamp its dilapidated infrastructure and modernize\r\nits institutions. Oil prices are bound to come down one day and when\r\nthey do Russia will discover the true and most malign cost of war - the\r\nopportunity cost.\r\n\r\nRussia's Israeli Oil Bond\r\n\r\nBy: Dr. Sam Vaknin\r\n\r\nAlso published by United Press International (UPI)\r\n\r\nAlso Read\r\n\r\nRussian Roulette - The Energy Sector\r\n\r\nLast week, Russia and Israel - erstwhile bitter Cold War enemies - have\r\nagreed to make use of Israel's neglected oil pipeline, known as the\r\nTipline. The conduit, an Iranian-Israeli joint venture completed in\r\n1968 is designed to carry close to a million barrels per day,\r\ncircumventing the Suez canal.\r\n\r\nIt rarely does, though. The Shah was deposed in 1979, Egypt became a\r\npivotal Western ally, the Israeli-developed Sinai oil fields were\r\nreturned to Egypt in the early 1980's, and, in a glutted market, Israel\r\nresorted to importing 99 percent of the 280,000 barrels it consumes\r\ndaily.\r\n\r\nAccording to Stratfor, the Strategic Forecasting consultancy, \"tankers\r\nbearing Russian crude from the Black Sea port of Novorossiysk would\r\nunload at Israel's Mediterranean port of Ashkelon. After that, the oil\r\nwould traverse the Tipline to Israel's Red Sea port of Eilat, where it\r\nwould be reloaded onto tankers for shipment to Asia. The Eilat-Ashkelon\r\nPipeline Co. estimates the pipeline will be ready for Russian crude in\r\nmid-2003.\"\r\n\r\nRussia is emerging as a major oil supplier and a serious challenge to\r\nthe hegemony of Saudi Arabia and OPEC. Even the USA increasingly taps\r\nthe Russian market for crude and derivatives. With Arab countries -\r\nincluding the hitherto unwaveringly loyal Gulf states - progressively\r\nperceived as hostile by American scholars and decision makers, Russia\r\narises as a potent alternative. The newfangled Russian-Israeli\r\ncommercial alliance probably won applause from Washington hardliners,\r\neager to relieve the Saudi stranglehold on energy supplies.\r\n\r\nQuoted by the American Foreign Policy Council, Russia's Energy\r\nMinister, Igor Yusufov, addressing the Russian-US Energy Forum in\r\nHouston, Texas, last month said that \"the high degree of economic and\r\npolitical stability that the Russian Federation has achieved makes it a\r\nreliable supplier of oil and gas.\"\r\n\r\nHe expressed his belief - shared by many analysts - that Russia will\r\nbecome a major exporter of oil to the USA \"in the foreseeable future\".\r\nAccording to the Dow Jones Newswires, private Russian oil firms, such\r\nas Lukoil, are heavily invested in US gas stations and refineries in\r\nanticipation of these inevitable developments. As if to underline\r\nthese, the Financial Times reported, on October 3, a purchase of\r\n300,000 barrels of oil from the Russian Tyumen Oil company.\r\n\r\nThe deal with Israel will allow Russia to peddle its oil in the Asian\r\nmarket, a major export target and a monopoly of the Gulf producers.\r\n\r\nRussia is in the throes of constructing several pipelines to Asia\r\nthrough its eastern territories and Pacific coastline - but completion\r\ndates are uncertain.\r\n\r\nFor its part, according to the Department of Energy, Israel extracts\r\nnatural gas from offshore fields but has no commercial fossil fuel\r\nresources of its own. It imports oil from Mexico, Norway, and the\r\nUnited Kingdom and coal from as far away as Australia, Colombia, and\r\nSouth Africa. Israel buys natural gas and oil from Egypt. The bulk of\r\nthe energy sector is moribund and state-owned, ostensibly for reasons\r\nof national security. The deal with Russia is a godsend.\r\n\r\nIsrael is perfectly located to offer an affordable alternative to\r\nexpensive and often clogged oil shipping lanes through the Suez Canal\r\nor the Cape. A revival of the Trans-Arabian pipeline (Tapline) to Haifa\r\ncan considerably under-price the politically wobbly Iraqi-Turkish and\r\nthe costly Suez-Mediterranean (Sumed) alternatives.\r\n\r\nWith one of every five Israelis a Russian migr and confronted with\r\nthe common enemy of Islamic militancy, Israel and Russia have embarked\r\non a path of close cooperation. Prime Minister Sharon's visit to Russia\r\nlast month was a resounding success. Faced with these millennial\r\ngeopolitical developments, anti-Semitic conspiracy theorists are having\r\na field day.\r\n\r\nThe Jewish lobby, they say, is coercing America, its long arm, to\r\nhijack the Iraqi oil fields in the forthcoming war and thus to\r\ncounterbalance surging Russian oil exports. Israel, they aver, planned\r\nto carry out, in October 2001, an operation - \"Mivtza Shekhina\" - to\r\nsecure southern Iraq's oil fields while also mitigating the threat of\r\nweapons of mass destruction aimed at its population centers.\r\n\r\nConspiratorial paranoia notwithstanding, it is unlikely that the USA is\r\nmotivated by oil interests in its war on Saddam. A battle in Iraq aimed\r\nsolely at apprehending its crude would be fighting over yesterday's\r\noilfields. Only an easily replaceable one tenth to one eighth of\r\nAmerican oil consumption emanates from the Gulf, about a million\r\nbarrels per day of it from Iraq. Moreover, the war is likely to\r\nalienate far more important suppliers, such as Russia - as well as the\r\nlargest European clients of Gulf oil extracted by American firms.\r\nStrictly in terms of oil, a war in Iraq is counterproductive.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, such a war is likely to push oil prices up. According to\r\nthe Council on Foreign Relations, \"for every dollar-per-barrel increase\r\nin oil prices, about $4 billion a year would leave America's $11\r\ntrillion economy, and other importing countries would lose another $16\r\nbillion per year.\"\r\n\r\nIsrael understandably did discuss with the USA its role in a showdown\r\nwith Iraq. Russia, unsettled as it is by America's growing presence in\r\ncentral Asia and exercised by its determination to take on Iraq - may\r\nbe trying to lure Israel away from its automatic support of US goals by\r\ndangling the oiled carrot of a joint pipeline.\r\n\r\nRussia also hopes to neuter the rapprochement between Israel and the\r\nIslamic nations of Turkey and Azerbaijan, traditional adversaries of\r\nMoscow. Israel is the second largest buyer of oil from Azerbaijan. It\r\nis one of the sponsors of a pipeline from the Baku oilfields to the\r\nport of Ceyhan in Turkey. The pipeline stands to compete with a less\r\ncostly and more hostile to the West Russian-Iranian route.\r\n\r\nThese are momentous times. Oil is still by far the most strategic\r\ncommodity and securing its uninterrupted flow is essential to the\r\nfunctioning of both developed and developing countries. There is a\r\ndiscernible tectonic shift in production and proven reserves from the\r\nPersian Gulf, the US except Alaska, the North Sea, and Latin America to\r\nnorthern Europe, Russia, and the Caspian Basin. Yet, oil is still a\r\nbuyers' market. OPEC has long been denuded of its mythical power and\r\noil prices - even at the current interim peak - are still historically\r\nlow in real terms.\r\n\r\nBut Russia stands to gain whichever way. Middle East tensions, in\r\nPalestine and Iraq, have ratcheted oil prices up resulting in a\r\nmuch-needed budgetary windfall. Russia's mostly-privatized oil industry\r\nhas cleverly ploughed back its serendipitous profits into pipelines,\r\ndrilling, and exploration. When the dust settles in the deserts of\r\nArabia, Russia will emerge victorious with the largest oil market\r\nshare. Israel is not oblivious to this scenario.\r\n\r\nRussia's Idled Spies\r\n\r\nBy: Dr. Sam Vaknin\r\n\r\nAlso published by United Press International (UPI)\r\n\r\nAlso Read\r\n\r\nThe Industrious Spies\r\n\r\nRussian Roulette - The Security Apparatus\r\n\r\nSweden expelled yesterday two Russian diplomats for spying on radar and\r\nmissile guidance technologies for the JAS 39 British-Swedish Gripen\r\nfighter jet developed by Telefon AB LM Ericsson, the telecommunications\r\nmultinational. The Russians threatened to reciprocate. Five current and\r\nformer employees of the corporate giant are being investigated.\r\nIronically, the first foreign buyer of the aircraft may well be Poland,\r\na former Soviet satellite state and a current European Union candidate.\r\n\r\nSweden arrested in February last year a worker of the Swiss-Swedish\r\nengineering group, ABB, on suspicion of spying for Russia. The man was\r\nreleased after two days for lack of evidence and reinstated. But the\r\nweighty Swedish daily, Dagens Nyheter, speculated that the recent\r\nRussian indiscretion was in deliberate retaliation for Swedish\r\nespionage in Russia. Sweden is rumored to have been in the market for\r\nRussian air radar designs and the JAS radar system is said by some\r\nobservers to uncannily resemble its eastern counterparts.\r\n\r\nThe same day, a Russian military intelligence (GRU) colonel, Aleksander\r\nSipachev, was sentenced in Moscow to eight years in prison and stripped\r\nof his rank. According to Russian news agencies, he was convicted of\r\nattempting to sell secret documents to the CIA. Russian secret service\r\npersonnel, idled by the withering of Russia's global presence, resort\r\nto private business or are re-deployed by the state to spy on\r\nindustrial and economic secrets in order to aid budding Russian\r\nmultinationals.\r\n\r\nAccording to the FBI and the National White-collar Crime Center,\r\nRussian former secret agents have teamed with computer hackers to break\r\ninto corporate networks to steal vital information about product\r\ndevelopment and marketing strategies. Microsoft has recently admitted\r\nto such a compromising intrusion.\r\n\r\nIn a December 1999 interview to Segodnya, a Russia paper, Eyer Winkler,\r\na former high-ranking staffer with the National Security Agency (NSA)\r\nconfirmed that \"corruption in the Russian Government, the Foreign\r\nIntelligence Service, and the Main Intelligence Department allows\r\nRussian organized criminal groups to use these departments in their own\r\ninterests. Criminals receive the major part of information collected by\r\nthe Russian special services by means of breaking into American\r\ncomputer networks.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the KGB was dismantled and replaced by a host of new acronyms,\r\nRussian industrial espionage was still in diapers. as a result, it is a\r\nbureaucratic no-man's land roamed by agents of the GRU, the Foreign\r\nIntelligence Service (SVR), and smaller outfits, such as the Federal\r\nAgency on Government Communications and Information (FAPSI).\r\n\r\nAccording to Stratfor, the strategic forecasting consultancy, \"the SVR\r\nand GRU both handle manned intelligence on U.S. territory, with the\r\nRussian Federal Security Service (FSB) doing counterintelligence in\r\nAmerica. Also, both the SVR and GRU have internal counterintelligence\r\nunits created for finding foreign intelligence moles.\" This, to some\r\nextent, is the division of labor in Europe as well.\r\n\r\nGermany's Federal Prosecutor has consistently warned against $5 billion\r\nworth of secrets pilfered annually from German industrial firms by\r\nforeign intelligence services, especially from east Europe and Russia.\r\nThe Counterintelligence News and Developments newsletter pegs the\r\ndamage at $13 billion in 1996 alone:\r\n\r\n\"Modus operandi included placing agents in international organizations,\r\nsetting up joint-ventures with German companies, and setting up bogus\r\ncompanies. The (Federal Prosecutor's) report also warned business\r\nleaders to be particularly wary of former diplomats or people who used\r\nto work for foreign secret services because they often had the language\r\nskills and knowledge of Germany that made them excellent agents.\"\r\n\r\nRussian spy rings now operate from Canada to Japan. Many of the spies\r\nhave been dormant for decades and recalled to service following the\r\nimplosion of the USSR. According to Asian media, Russians have become\r\nincreasingly active in the Far East, mainly in Japan, South Korea,\r\nTaiwan, and mainland China.\r\n\r\nRussia is worried about losing its edge in avionics, electronics,\r\ninformation technology and some emerging defense industries such as\r\nlaser shields, positronics, unmanned vehicles, wearable computing, and\r\nreal time triple C (communication, command and control) computerized\r\nbattlefield management. The main targets are, surprisingly, Israel and\r\nFrance. According to media reports, the substantive clients of Russia's\r\ndefense industry - such as India - insist on hollowing out Russian\r\ncraft and installing Israeli and west European systems instead.\r\n\r\nRussia's paranoid state of mind extends to its interior.\r\nUralinformbureau reported earlier this year that the Yamal-Nenets\r\nautonomous okrug (district) restricted access to foreigners citing\r\nconcerns about industrial espionage and potential sabotage of oil and\r\ngas companies. The Kremlin maintains an ever-expanding list of regions\r\nand territories with limited - or outright - forbidden - access to\r\nforeigners.\r\n\r\nThe FSB, the KGB's main successor, is busy arresting spies all over the\r\nvast country. To select a random events of the dozens reported every\r\nyear - and many are not - the Russian daily Kommersant recounted in\r\nFebruary how when the Trunov works at the Novolipetsk metallurgical\r\ncombine concluded an agreement with a Chinese company to supply it with\r\nslabs, its chief negotiator was nabbed as a spy working for \"circles in\r\nChina\". His crime? He was in possession of certain documents which\r\ncontained \"intellectual property\" of the crumbling and antiquated mill\r\npertaining to a slab quality enhancement process.\r\n\r\nForeigners are also being arrested, though rarely. An American\r\nbusinessman, Edmund Pope, was detained in April 2000 for attempting to\r\npurchase the blueprints of an advanced torpedo from a Russian\r\nscientist. There have been a few other isolated apprehensions, mainly\r\nfor \"proper\", military, espionage. But Russians bear the brunt of the\r\ncampaign against foreign economic intelligence gathering.\r\n\r\nStrana.ru reported last December that, speaking on the occasion of\r\nSecurity Services Day, Putin - himself a KGB alumnus - warned veterans\r\nthat the most crucial task facing the services today is \"protecting the\r\ncountry's economy against industrial espionage.\"\r\n\r\nThis is nothing new. According to History of Espionage Web site, long\r\nbefore they established diplomatic relations with the USA in 1933, the\r\nSoviets had Amtorg Trading Company. Ostensibly its purpose was to\r\nencourage joint ventures between Russian and American firms. Really it\r\nwas a hub of industrial undercover activities. Dozens of Soviet\r\nintelligence officers supervised, at its peak during the Depression,\r\n800 American communists. The Soviet Union's European operations in\r\nBerlin (Handelsvertretung) and in London (Arcos, Ltd.) were even more\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\nRussia's Middle Class\r\n\r\nBy: Dr. Sam Vaknin\r\n\r\nAlso published by United Press International (UPI)\r\n\r\nAlso Read\r\n\r\nWomen in Transition\r\n\r\nA conference held, at the beginning of the month, in St. Petersburg,\r\nwas aptly titled \"Middle Class - The Myths and the Reality\". Russia is\r\nway poorer than Slovenia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, or even Poland.\r\nBut, as income disparities grow, a group of discriminating consumers\r\nwith the purchasing power to match, is re-emerging, having been\r\nsubmerged by the 1998 implosion of the financial sector.\r\n\r\nThe typical salary in the large metropolises is now more than $600 per\r\nmonth - four times the meager national average. Some 20 percent of the\r\nworkforce in Moscow earns more than $1700 a month, comparable to many\r\nmembers of the European Union. Real average wages across Russia have\r\nsurpassed the pre-1998 level in May.\r\n\r\nMoreover, Russians are unburdened by debt and their utility bills and\r\nfood are heavily subsidized, though decreasingly so. Few pay taxes -\r\nlately dramatically reduced and simplified - and even fewer save. Every\r\nrise in disposable income is immediately translated to unadulterated\r\nconsumption. Takings are understated - Russia's informal economy is\r\nprobably half as big as its formal sector.\r\n\r\nA study, financed by the Carnegie Foundation, found that only 7 percent\r\nof Russians qualify as middle class. Another 12 percent or so have some\r\nbourgeois characteristics. Sixty percent of them are men, though the\r\nKomkon marketing research agency says that the genders are equally\r\nrepresented.\r\n\r\nFigures culled from the census conducted this year throughout the\r\nRussian Federation - the first since 1989 - are expected to confirm\r\nthese findings. About one fifth to one quarter of all Russian\r\nhouseholds earn more than the average monthly income of $150 per\r\nperson.\r\n\r\nPolitical parties which purport to represent the middle class - such as\r\nthe Union of the Forces of the Right (SPS) - garnered 10-15 percent of\r\nthe votes in the 1999 parliamentary elections. Direct action groups of\r\nthe \"third estate\" may transform the political landscape in forthcoming\r\nelections.\r\n\r\nIn a recent study by sociologists from the Russian Academy of Sciences'\r\nInstitute of Philosophy, more than half of all Russians\r\nself-flatteringly considered themselves middle class. This is\r\ndelusional. Even the optimistic research firm Premier-TGI pegs the\r\nnumber at 19 percent at most.\r\n\r\nBusinesses adapt to these new demands of shifting tastes and\r\npreferences. The St. Petersburg-based cellular operator Delta Telecom,\r\nowner of the first license to provide wireless-communications services\r\nin Russia, intends to test the market among middle class clients.\r\n\r\nIkea, the Swedish home improvement chain, has plunged $200 million into\r\na new shopping center. French, German and Dutch cash-and-carry and\r\ndo-it-yourself groups are slated to follow. Russian competitors, every\r\nbit as sleek, have erupted on the scene. The investment spree has\r\nengulfed the provinces as well.\r\n\r\nLast month, Citibank opened a retail outlet for affluent individuals in\r\nMoscow - though its standards of transparency may yet scare them off,\r\nas Gazeta.ru observed astutely. A private cemetery in Samara caters to\r\nthe needs of the expired newly rich. Opulently-stocked emporiums have\r\nsprouted in all urban centers. TV shopping and even online commerce are\r\non the up. According to the Washington Post, Moscow retail space will\r\nhave tripled by the end of next year from its level at the beginning of\r\n2002.\r\n\r\nThe Russian Expert magazine says that the middle class, minuscule as it\r\nis, accounted last year for a staggering 55 percent of all consumer\r\ngoods purchased and generates one third of Russia's gross domestic\r\nproduct. The middle class is Russia's most important engine of wealth\r\nformation and investment, far outweighing foreign capital.\r\n\r\nRussia's post-1998 fledgling middle class is described as young,\r\nwell-educated, well-traveled, community-orientated, entrepreneurial and\r\nsuffused with work ethic and a desire for social mobility. It is almost\r\nas if the crisis four years ago served as a purgatory, purging sins and\r\nsinners alike and creating the conditions for the revival of a\r\nhealthier, longer-lived, bourgeoisie.\r\n\r\nBut being middle class is a state of mind more than a measure of\r\nwealth. It is an all-encompassing worldview, a set of values, a code of\r\nconduct, a list of goals, aspirations, fantasies and preferences and a\r\ncatalog of moral do's and don'ts. This is where transition,\r\nmicromanaged by western \"experts\" failed.\r\n\r\nThe mere exposure to free markets was supposed to unleash innovation\r\nand entrepreneurship in the long-oppressed populations of east Europe.\r\nWhen this prescription - known as \"shock therapy\" - bombed, the West\r\ntried to engender a stable, share-holding, business-owning, middle\r\nclass by financing small size enterprises. It then proceeded to\r\nstrengthen and transform indigenous institutions.\r\n\r\nNone of it worked. Transition had no grassroots support and its\r\nprescriptive - and painful - nature caused wide resentment and\r\nobstruction. When the dust settled, Russia found itself with a putative\r\n- and puny - middle class. But it was an anomalous beast, very\r\ndifferent from its ostensible European or American counterparts.\r\n\r\nTo start with, Russia's new middle class is a distinct minority.\r\n\r\nPrism, a publication of the Jamestown Foundation, quoted, in its August\r\n2001 issue, the Serbian author Milorad Pavic as saying that \"the\r\nRussian middle class is like a young generation whose fathers suffered\r\na severe defeat in a war: with no feeling of guilt and no victorious\r\nfathers to boss them around, the children of defeat see no obstacles\r\nbefore them.\"\r\n\r\nBut this metaphor is misleading. The Russian middle class is a nascent\r\nexception - not an overarching rule. As Akos Rona-Tas, Associate\r\nProfessor in the Sociology Department at the University of California,\r\nSan Diego, notes correctly in his paper \"Post Communist Transition and\r\nthe Absent Middle Class in Central East Europe\", a middle class that is\r\nin the minority is an oxymoron:\r\n\r\n\"In democracies the middle class is the nation proper. The typical\r\nmember of a national community is a member of the middle class. When\r\ndemocratic governments need a social group they can address, a\r\nuniversal class that carries the overarching, common interest of the\r\ncountry, they appeal to the middle class. This appeal, while it calls\r\non a common interest, also acknowledges that there are conflicting\r\ninterests within society. The middle class is not everyone, but it is\r\nthe majority and it represents what everyone else can become.\"\r\n\r\nRussia has a long way to go to achieve this ubiquity. Its middle class,\r\nfar from representing the consensus, reifies the growing abyss between\r\nhaves and haves not. Its members' conspicuous consumption, mostly of\r\nimports, does little to support the local economy. Its political might\r\nis self-serving. It has no ethos, or distinct morality, no narrative,\r\nor ideology. The Russian middle class is at a Hobbesian and primordial\r\nstage.\r\n\r\nWhether it emerges from its narcissistic cocoon to become a leading and\r\nguiding social force, is doubtful. The middle class' youth, urbaneness,\r\ncosmopolitanism, polyglotism, mobility, avarice and drive are viewed\r\nwith suspicion and envy by the great unwashed - the overwhelming\r\nmajority of Russia's destitute population. Empowered by their wealth,\r\nthe new bourgeoisie, in turn, regards the \"people\" with naive\r\nadmiration, patronizing condescension, or horror.\r\n\r\nGranted, this muted, subterranean, interaction is not entirely\r\ndeleterious. It is the social role of the rich to generate demand by\r\nprovoking in the poor jealousy and attempts at emulation. The wealthy\r\nare the trendsetters, the early adopters, the pioneers, the buzz\r\nleaders. They are the engine that engenders social and economic\r\nmobility.\r\n\r\nA similar dynamic is admittedly evident in Russia - but, again, it is\r\ntampered by a curious local phenomenon.\r\n\r\nWriting for the Globalist, two Brookings Institution scholars, Carol\r\nGraham, a Senior Fellow of Economic Studies and Clifford Gaddy, a\r\nFellow of Foreign Policy and Governance Studies described it thus:\r\n\r\n\"The eyes of Russia's middle class, on the other hand, are figuratively\r\ndirected downward, towards the poor. In fact, as poverty in Russia\r\nincreased dramatically in the 1990s, the middle class's reference norms\r\nshifted downward as well. As a result, Russia may be the only country\r\nin the world where the \"subjective poverty line\" is falling.\r\n\r\nThat is, the amount of money that Russians say that they need in order\r\nto stay out of poverty has been steadily falling over the past five\r\nyears. It is even below the objective poverty line. For the time being,\r\nat least, these curious Russian attitudes, along with the existence of\r\nthe non-monetary virtual economy, have insulated the country against\r\npolitical upheaval.\"\r\n\r\nThe list of anomalies is not exhausted.\r\n\r\nThe new middle class comprises the embryonic legitimate business elite\r\n- entrepreneurs, professionals and managers - but not the remnants of\r\nthe financially strapped intelligentsia. It is brawn with little\r\nbrains. In dissonance with western Europe, according to a survey\r\npublished in the last two years by Expert magazine, the majority of its\r\nmembers are nationalistic, authoritarian and xenophobic. Their\r\nself-interested economic liberalism is coupled with social and\r\npolitical intolerance. But two thirds of them support some kind of\r\nwelfare state.\r\n\r\nThus, there are major differences between the middle class in the West\r\nand its ostensible counterpart in Russia.\r\n\r\nThe Russian parvenus - many of them women - do not believe their state,\r\ntheir banks, or their compatriots. They fear a precarious future and\r\nits inevitable calamities though they are not risk averse and are\r\nrather optimistic in the short run. They keep their money under the\r\nproverbial mattress, invest it surreptitiously in their ventures, or\r\nsmuggle it abroad. They are not - yet - stakeholders in their country's\r\nstability and prosperity.\r\n\r\nOften bamboozled by other businessmen and fleeced by a rapacious\r\nbureaucracy, they are paranoid. Tax evasion is still rampant, though\r\nabating. They trust in equity and avoid debt. Some of them have\r\ncriminal roots or a criminal mindset - or are former members of\r\nRussia's shady security services.\r\n\r\nThree fifths, according to the Expert-Komkon survey, find it \"hard to\r\nsurvive\" when \"observing all laws\". \"Strong leaders are better than all\r\nsorts of laws\" is their motto, quoted by Izvestia. Generally, they are\r\ncloser to being robbers than barons.\r\n\r\nEarly capitalism is always unruly. It is transformed into a highly\r\nstructured edifice by the ownership of land and realty (the prime\r\ncollateral), the protection of private property, a functioning\r\nfinancial system comprised of both banks and capital markets and the\r\njust and expedient application of the rule of law.\r\n\r\nRussia has none of these. According to Business Week, bank deposits\r\namount to 4 percent of the country's mid-size GDP - compared to half of\r\nGDP in other industrialized countries. Mortgages are unheard of,\r\ndeposits are not insured and land ownership is a novel proposition. The\r\njudiciary is venal and incompetent. Might is still right in vast\r\nswathes of the land.\r\n\r\nThe state and the oligarchs continue to represent a rent-seeking\r\nopportunity. Businessmen spend time seeking concessions, permits,\r\nexemptions and licenses rather than conducting business. The \"civic\r\ninstitutions\" they form - chambers of commerce, clubs - are often mere\r\nglorified lobbying outfits of special and vested interests. Informal\r\nnetworks of contacts count more than any statute or regulation. In such\r\na mock \"modern state\" no wonder Russia ended up with a Potemkin \"middle\r\nclass\".\r\n\r\nRussia in 2003\r\n\r\nBy: Dr. Sam Vaknin\r\n\r\nAlso published by United Press International (UPI)\r\n\r\nContrary to recent impressions, Russia's Western (American-German)\r\norientation is at least as old as Gorbachev's reign. It was vigorously\r\npursued by Yeltsin. Still, 2002 marks the year in which Russia became\r\nmerely another satellite of the United States - though one armed with\r\nan ageing nuclear arsenal.\r\n\r\nRussia's economy has revived remarkably after the 1998 crisis, but it\r\nis still addicted to Western investments, aid and credits. Encircled by\r\nNATO to its West and US troops stationed in its central Asian\r\nhinterland, Russia's capitulation is complete. In the aftermath of\r\nconflicts to be engineered by the United States in Afghanistan, Iraq,\r\nNorth Korea, Iran, Syria and, potentially, Cuba - Russia may feel\r\nthreatened geopolitically as well as economically. Both Iran and Iraq,\r\nfor instance, are large trading partners and leading export\r\ndestinations of the Russian Federation.\r\n\r\nIf anything can undo the hitherto impressive personality cult of\r\nRussia's new \"strong man\", Vladimir Putin, it is this injured pride\r\namong the more penumbral ranks of the country's security services.\r\nRussia's history is littered with the bloodied remains of upheavals\r\nwrought by violent ideological minorities and by assorted conspirators.\r\n\r\nHence Putin's tentative - and reluctant - attempts to team up with\r\nChina and India to establish a multi-polar world and his closer\r\nmilitary cooperation with Kyrgyzstan and Armenia - both intended to\r\ncounter nationalistic opposition at home.\r\n\r\nLuckily, the sense of decline is by no means prevalent.\r\n\r\nRussians polled by the American Pew Research Center admitted that they\r\nfeel much better in a world dominated by the United States as a single\r\nsuperpower. The KGB and its successors - Putin's former long-term\r\nemployers - actually engineered Russia's opening to the West and the\r\npresident's meteoric ascendancy. And no one in the army seriously\r\ndisputes the need for reform, professionalization and merciless\r\ntrimming of the bloated corps.\r\n\r\nReforms - of the military, Russia's decrepit utilities, dilapidated\r\ninfrastructure and housing, inflated and venal bureaucracy, corrupt\r\njudiciary and civil service, choking monopolies and pernicious banking\r\nsector - depend on the price of oil. Russia benefited mightily from the\r\nsurge in the value of the \"black gold\". But the windfall has helped\r\nmask pressing problems and allowed timid legislators and officials to\r\npostpone much needed - and fiercely resisted - changes.\r\n\r\nRussia's \"economic miracle\" - oft-touted by the \"experts\" that brought\r\nyou \"shock therapy\" and by egregiously self-interested, Moscow-based,\r\ninvestment bankers - is mostly prestidigitation. As the European Bank\r\nfor Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) correctly noted in November,\r\nRussia's 20 percent growth in the last three years merely reflects\r\nenhanced usage of capacity idled by the ruination of 1998.\r\n\r\nNeutering the positive externality of rising oil prices, one is left\r\nwith no increase in productivity since 1999. Industrial production -\r\noutside the oil sector - actually slumped. As metropolitan incomes\r\nrise, Russians revert to imports rather than consume shoddy and shabby\r\nlocal products.\r\n\r\nThis, in turn, adversely affects the current account balance and the\r\nviability of local enterprises, some of which are sincerely attempting\r\nto restructure. According to Trud, a Russian business publication, two\r\nfifths of the country's businesses are in the red. Russia's number of\r\nsmall and medium enterprises peaked at 1 million in 1995-6. They employ\r\nless than one fifth of the workforce (compared to two thirds in the\r\nEuropean Union and in many other countries in transition).\r\n\r\nThus, falling oil prices - though detrimental to Russia's ability to\r\nrepay its external debt and balance its budget - are a blessing in\r\ndisguise. Such declines will force the hand of the Putin administration\r\nto engage in some serious structural reform - even in the face of\r\nparliamentary elections in 2003 and presidential ones the year after.\r\n\r\nRussians - wrongly - feel that their standard of living has stagnated.\r\nGazeta.ru claims that 39 million people are below the poverty line.\r\nMany pensioners survive on $1 a day. In truth, real income per capita\r\nis actually up by more than 8 percent this year alone. Income\r\ninequality, though, has, indeed, gaped.\r\n\r\nResponding to these concerns, though, in a \"coattails\" effect, the\r\npresident is expected to carry pro-Kremlin parties back into power in\r\n2003 - a modicum of elections-inspired bribing is inevitable. State\r\nwages and pensions will outpace inflation. The energy behemoths - major\r\nsources of campaign financing - will be rewarded with rises in tariffs\r\nto match cost of living increases.\r\n\r\nRussia faces more than merely a skewed wealth distribution or\r\ndependence on mineral wealth. Its difficulties are myriad. On cue from\r\nWashington, it is again being hyped in the Western press as a sure-fire\r\ninvestment destination and a pair of safe geostrategic hands. But the\r\ndismal truth is that it is a third world country with first world\r\npretensions (and nuclear weapons). It exhibits all the risks attendant\r\nto other medium-sized developing countries and emerging economies.\r\n\r\nExternal debt repayments next year will exceed $15 billion. It can\r\neasily afford them with oil prices anywhere above $20 and foreign\r\nexchange reserves the highest since 1991. Russia even prepaid some of\r\nits debt mountain this year. But if its export proceeds were to decline\r\nby 40 percent in the forthcoming 3-4 years, Russia will, yet again, be\r\nforced to reschedule or default. Every $1 dollar decline in Ural crude\r\nprices translates to more than $1 billion lost income to the government.\r\n\r\nRussia's population is both contracting and ageing. A ruinous pension\r\ncrisis is in the cards unless both the run-down health system and the\r\nabysmally low birthrate recover. Immigration of ethnic Russians from\r\nthe former republics of the USSR to the Russian Federation has largely\r\nrun its course. According to Pravda.ru, more than 7 million people\r\nemigrated from the Federation in the last decade.\r\n\r\nRussia's informal sector is a vital, though crime-tainted, engine of\r\ngrowth. Laundered money coupled with reinvested profits - from both\r\nlegitimate and illicit businesses - drive a lot of the private sector\r\nand underlie the emergence of an affluent elite, especially in Moscow\r\nand other urban centers. According to the Economist Intelligence Unit,\r\nGoskomstat - the State Statistics Committee - regularly adjusts the\r\nformal figures up by 25 percent to incorporate estimates of the black\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\nRussia faces a dilemma: to quash the economic underground and thus\r\nenhance both tax receipts and Russia's image as an orderly polity - or\r\nto let the pent-up entrepreneurial forces of the \"gray sectors\" work\r\ntheir magic?\r\n\r\nRussia is slated to join the World Trade Organization in 2004. This\r\nhappy occasion would mean deregulation, liberalization and opening up\r\nto competition - all agonizing moves. Russian industry and agriculture\r\nare not up to the task. It took a massive devaluation and a\r\ndebilitating financial crisis in 1998 to resurrect consumer appetite\r\nfor indigenous goods.\r\n\r\nFarming is mostly state-owned, or state-sponsored. Monopolies,\r\nduopolies and cartels make up the bulk of the manufacturing and mining\r\nsectors - especially in the wake of the recent tsunami of mergers and\r\nacquisitions. The Economist Intelligence Unit quotes estimates that 20\r\nconglomerates account for up to 70 percent of the country's $330\r\nbillion GDP. The oligarchs are still there, lurking. The banks are\r\nstill paralyzed and compromised, though their retail sector is\r\nreviving.\r\n\r\nRussians are still ambivalent about foreigners. Paranoid xenophobia was\r\nreplaced by guarded wariness. Recently, Russia revoked the fast track\r\nwork permit applications hitherto put to good use by managers, scholars\r\nand experts from the West. Foreign minority shareholders still complain\r\nof being ripped-off by powerful, well-connected - and minacious -\r\nbusiness interests.\r\n\r\nWith the bloody exception of Chechnya, Putin's compelling personality\r\nhas helped subdue the classic tensions between center and regions. But,\r\nas Putin himself admitted in a radio Q-and-A session on December 19,\r\nthis peaceful co-existence is fraying at the edges.\r\n\r\nThe president will try to reach a top-down political settlement in the\r\nrenegade province prior to the 2004 elections, but will fail. Reform is\r\nanathema to many suborned governors of the periphery and the Kremlin's\r\nmiserly handouts are insufficient to grant it a decisive voice in\r\nmatters provincial. Devolution - a pet Putin project - is more about\r\naccepting an unsavory reality than about re-defining the Russian state.\r\n\r\nThe economic disparity between rural and urban is striking. The\r\nEconomist Intelligence Unit describes this chasm thus:\r\n\r\n\"The processing industry is concentrated in the cities of Moscow, St\r\nPetersburg, Yekaterinburg and Nizhny Novgorod. These larger cities have\r\nmanaged the transition relatively well, as size has tended to bring\r\nwith it industrial diversity; smaller industrial centers have fared far\r\nworse. The Soviet regime created new industrial centers such as Tomsk\r\nand Novosibirsk, but Siberia and the Russian Far Eastern regions remain\r\nlargely unindustrialised, having traditionally served as a raw\r\nmaterials and energy base. Owing to the boundless faith of Soviet\r\nplanners in the benefits of scale, one massive enterprise, or a small\r\ngroup of related enterprises, often formed the basis for the entire\r\nlocal economy of a substantial city or region. This factor, compounded\r\nby the absence of unemployment benefits, makes the closure of bankrupt\r\nenterprises a politically difficult decision.\"\r\n\r\nThe politically incorrect truth is that Russia's old power-structure is\r\nlargely intact, having altered only its ideological label. It is as\r\navaricious, nefarious and obstructive as ever. Nor does the Russian\r\nstate sport any checks and balances. Its institutions are suspect, its\r\nexecutive untouchable, its law enforcement agencies delinquent.\r\n\r\nRussians still hanker after \"men of iron\" and seek tradition rather\r\nthan innovation, prefer unity to pluralism, and appreciate authority\r\nmore than individualism. Russia - a ramshackle amalgamation of\r\ncompeting turfs - is still ill-suited for capitalism or for liberal\r\ndemocracy, though far less than it was only ten years ago.\r\n\r\nConspicuous consumption of imported products by vulgar parvenus is no\r\nsubstitute to true modernity and a functioning economy. Russia is\r\nfrequently praised by expats with vested interests and by international\r\nfinancial institutions, the long arms of its newfound ally, the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nBut, in truth, \"modern\", \"stable\", Russia is merely a glittering veneer\r\nbeneath which lurk, festering, the old ills of authoritarianism,\r\nlawlessness, oligarchy, aggression, ignorance, superstition, and\r\nrepression mingled with extremes of poverty and disease. Here is one\r\nsafe prediction: none of these will diminish next year.\r\n\r\nRussia Straddles the Euro-Atlantic Divide\r\n\r\nBy: Dr. Sam Vaknin\r\n\r\nAlso published by United Press International (UPI)\r\n\r\nAlso Read\r\n\r\nThe Janus Look\r\n\r\nRussia's Second Empire\r\n\r\nRussian Roulette - The Security Apparatus\r\n\r\nRussia as a Creditor\r\n\r\nLet My People Go - The Jackson-Vanik Controversy\r\n\r\nThe Chechen Theatre Ticket\r\n\r\nRussia's Israeli Oil Bond\r\n\r\nRussia's Idled Spies\r\n\r\nRussia in 2003\r\n\r\nRussian President Vladimir Putin warned on Tuesday, in an interview he\r\ngranted to TF1, a French television channel, that unilateral\r\nAmerican-British military action against Iraq would be a \"grave\r\nmistake\" and an \"unreasonable use of force\". Russia might veto it in\r\nthe Security Council, he averred.\r\n\r\nIn a joint declaration with France and Germany, issued the same day, he\r\ncalled to enhance the number of arms inspectors in Iraq as an\r\nalternative to war.\r\n\r\nOnly weeks ago Russia was written off, not least by myself, as a\r\nsatellite of the United States. This newfound assertiveness has\r\nconfounded analysts and experts everywhere. Yet, appearances aside, it\r\ndoes not signal a fundamental shift in Russian policy or worldview.\r\n\r\nRussia could not resist the temptation of playing once more the\r\nLeninist game of \"inter-imperialist contradictions\". It has long\r\nmasterfully exploited chinks in NATO's armor to further its own\r\neconomic, if not geopolitical, goals. Its convenient geographic sprawl\r\n- part Europe, part Asia - allows it to pose as both a continental\r\npower and a global one with interests akin to those of the United\r\nStates. Hence the verve with which it delved into the war against\r\nterrorism, recasting internal oppression and meddling abroad as its\r\nelements.\r\n\r\nAs Vladimir Lukin, deputy speaker of the Duma observed recently,\r\nBritain having swerved too far towards America - Russia may yet become\r\nan intermediary between a bitterly disenchanted USA and an irked Europe\r\nand between the rich, industrialized West and developing countries in\r\nAsia. Publicly, the USA has only mildly disagreed with Russia's\r\nreluctance to countenance a military endgame in Iraq - while showering\r\nFrance and Germany with vitriol for saying, essentially, the same\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nThe United States knows that Russia will not jeopardize the relevance\r\nof the Security Council - one of the few remaining hallmarks of past\r\nSoviet grandeur - by vetoing an American-sponsored resolution. But\r\nRussia cannot be seen to be abandoning a traditional ally and a major\r\ncustomer (Iraq) and newfound friends (France and Germany) too\r\nexpediently.\r\n\r\nNor can Putin risk further antagonizing Moscow hardliners who already\r\nregard his perceived \"Gorbachev-like\" obsequiousness and far reaching\r\nconcessions to the USA as treasonous. The scrapping of the Anti\r\nBallistic Missile treaty, the expansion of NATO to Russia's borders,\r\nAmerica's presence in central Asia and the Caucasus, Russia's \"near\r\nabroad\" - are traumatic reversals of fortune.\r\n\r\nAn agreed consultative procedure with the crumbling NATO hardly\r\nqualifies as ample compensation. There are troubling rumblings of\r\ndiscontent in the army. A few weeks ago, a Russian general in Chechnya\r\nrefused Putin's orders publicly - and with impunity. Additionally,\r\naccording to numerous opinion polls, the vast majority of Russians\r\noppose an Iraqi campaign.\r\n\r\nBy aligning itself with the fickle France and the brooding and\r\nsomnolent Germany, Russia is warning the USA that it should not be\r\ntaken for granted and that there is a price to pay for its allegiance\r\nand good services. But Putin is not Boris Yeltsin, his inebriated\r\npredecessor who over-played his hand in opposing NATO's operation in\r\nKosovo in 1999 - only to be sidelined, ignored and humiliated in the\r\npostwar arrangements.\r\n\r\nRussia wants a free hand in Chechnya and to be heard on international\r\nissues. It aspires to secure its oil contracts in Iraq - worth tens of\r\nbillions of dollars - and the repayment of $9 billion in old debts by\r\nthe postbellum government. It seeks pledges that the oil market will\r\nnot be flooded by a penurious Iraq. It desires a free hand in Ukraine,\r\nArmenia and Uzbekistan, among others. Russia wants to continue to sell\r\n$4 billion a year in arms to China, India, Iran, Syria and other\r\npariahs unhindered.\r\n\r\nOnly the United States, the sole superpower, can guarantee that these\r\ndemands are met. Moreover, with a major oil producer such as Iraq as a\r\nUS protectorate, Russia becomes a hostage to American goodwill. Yet,\r\nhitherto, all Russia received were expression of sympathy, claimed\r\nValeri Fyodorov, director of Political Friends, an independent Russian\r\nthink-tank, in an interview in the Canadian daily, National Post.\r\n\r\nThese are not trivial concerns. Russia's is a primitive economy, based\r\non commodities - especially energy products - and an over-developed\r\nweapons industry. Its fortunes fluctuate with the price of oil, of\r\nagricultural produce and with the need for arms, driven by regional\r\nconflicts.\r\n\r\nShould the price of oil collapse, Russia may again be forced to resort\r\nto multilateral financing, a virtual monopoly of the long arms of US\r\nforeign policy, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The USA\r\nalso has a decisive voice in the World Trade Organization (WTO),\r\nmembership thereof being a Russian strategic goal.\r\n\r\nIt was the United States which sponsored Russia's seat at table of the\r\nG8 - the Group of Eight industrialized states - a much coveted\r\nreassertion of the Russian Federation's global weight. According to\r\nRossiiskaya Gazeta, a Russian paper, the USA already announced a week\r\nago that it is considering cutting Russia off American financial aid -\r\nprobably to remind the former empire who is holding the purse strings.\r\n\r\nBut siding with America risks alienating the all-important core of\r\nEurope: Germany and France. Europe - especially Germany - is Russia's\r\nlargest export destination and foreign investor. Russia is not\r\noblivious to that. It would like to be compensated generously by the\r\nUnited States for assuming such a hazard.\r\n\r\nStill, Europe is a captive of geography and history. It has few\r\nfeasible alternatives to Russian gas, for instance. As the recent $7\r\nbillion investment by British Petroleum proves, Russia - and, by\r\nextension, central and east Europe - is Europe's growth zone and\r\nnatural economic hinterland.\r\n\r\nYet, it is America that captures the imagination of Russian oligarchs\r\nand lesser businesses.\r\n\r\nRussia aims to become the world's largest oil producer within the\r\ndecade. With this in mind, it is retooling its infrastructure and\r\ninvesting in new pipelines and ports. The United States is aggressively\r\ncourted by Russian officials and \"oiligarchs\" - the energy tycoons.\r\n\r\nWith the Gulf states cast in the role of anti-American Islamic\r\nmilitants, Russia emerges as a sane and safe - i.e., rationally driven\r\nby self-interest - alternative supplier and a useful counterweight to\r\nan increasingly assertive and federated Europe.\r\n\r\nRussia's affinity with the United States runs deeper that the\r\nconfluence of commercial interests.\r\n\r\nRussian capitalism is far more \"Anglo-Saxon\" than Old Europe's. The\r\nFederation has an educated but cheap and abundant labor force, a patchy\r\nwelfare state, exportable natural endowments, a low tax burden and a\r\npressing need for unhindered inflows of foreign investment.\r\n\r\nRussia's only hope of steady economic growth is the expansion of its\r\nenergy behemoths abroad. Last year it has become a net foreign direct\r\ninvestor. It has a vested interest in globalization and world order\r\nwhich coincide with America's. China, for instance, is as much Russia's\r\npotential adversary as it is the United State's.\r\n\r\nRussia welcomed the demise of the Taliban and is content with regime\r\nchanges in Iraq and North Korea - all American exploits. It can - and\r\ndoes - contribute to America's global priorities. Collaboration between\r\nthe two countries' intelligence services has never been closer. Hence\r\nalso the thaw in Russia's relations with its erstwhile foe, Israel.\r\n\r\nRussia's population is hungry and abrasively materialistic. Its robber\r\nbarons are more American in spirit than any British or French\r\nentrepreneur. Russia's business ethos is reminiscent of 19th century\r\nfrontier America, not of 20th century staid Germany.\r\n\r\nRussia is driven by kaleidoscopically shifting coalitions within a\r\nnarrow elite, not by its masses - and the elite wants money, a lot of\r\nit and now. In Russia's unbreakable cycle,  money yields power which\r\nleads to more money. The country is a functioning democracy but\r\nelections there do not revolve around the economy. Most taxes are\r\nevaded by most taxpayers and half the gross national product is anyhow\r\nunderground. Ordinary people crave law and order - or, at least a\r\nsemblance thereof.\r\n\r\nHence Putin's rock idol popularity. He caters to the needs of the elite\r\nby cozying up to the West and, in particular, to America - even as he\r\nprovides the lower classes with a sense of direction and security they\r\nlacked since 1985. But Putin is a serendipitous president. He enjoys\r\nthe aftereffects of a sharply devalued, export-enhancing,\r\nimports-depressing ruble and the vertiginous tripling of oil prices,\r\nRussia's main foreign exchange generator.\r\n\r\nThe last years of Yeltsin have been so traumatic that the bickering\r\ncogs and wheels of Russia's establishment united behind the only\r\nvote-getter they could lay their hands on: Putin, an obscure politician\r\nand former KGB officer. To a large extent, he proved to be an agreeable\r\npuppet, concerned mostly with self-preservation and the imaginary\r\nprojection of illusory power.\r\n\r\nPutin's great asset is his pragmatism and realistic assessment of the\r\nshambles that Russia has become and of his own limitations. He has\r\nturned himself into a kind of benevolent and enlightened arbiter among\r\nfeuding interests - and as the merciless and diligent executioner of\r\nthe decisions of the inner cabals of power.\r\n\r\nHitherto he kept everyone satisfied. But Iraq is his first real test.\r\nEveryone demands commitments backed by actions. Both the Europeans and\r\nthe Americans want him to put his vote at the Security Council where\r\nhis mouth is. The armed services want him to oppose war in Iraq. The\r\nintelligence services are divided. The Moslem population inside Russia\r\n- and surrounding it on all sides - is restive and virulently\r\nanti-American.\r\n\r\nThe oil industry is terrified of America' domination of the world's\r\nsecond largest proven reserves - but also craves to do business in the\r\nUnited States. Intellectuals and Russian diplomats worry about\r\nAmerica's apparent disregard for the world order spawned by the horrors\r\nof World War II. The average Russian regards the Iraqi stalemate as an\r\ninternal American affair. \"It is not our war\", is a common refrain,\r\ngrowing commoner.\r\n\r\nPutin has played it admirably nimbly. Whether he ultimately succeeds in\r\nthis impossible act of balancing remains to be seen. The smart money\r\nsays he would. But if the last three years have taught us anything it\r\nis that the smart money is often disastrously wrong.\r\n\r\nRussia's Stealth Diplomacy\r\n\r\nBy: Dr. Sam Vaknin\r\n\r\nAlso published by United Press International (UPI)\r\n\r\nAlso Read\r\n\r\nThe Janus Look\r\n\r\nRussia's Second Empire\r\n\r\nRussia as a Creditor\r\n\r\nThe Chechen Theatre Ticket\r\n\r\nRussia's Israeli Oil Bond\r\n\r\nRussia's Idled Spies\r\n\r\nRussia in 2003\r\n\r\nRussia Straddles the Euro-Atlantic Divide\r\n\r\nRussian Roulette - The Security Apparatus\r\n\r\nLet My People Go - The Jackson-Vanik Controversy\r\n\r\nPossibly irked by persistent American U-2 aerial spy missions above its\r\nfringes, Russia fired yesterday, from a mobile launcher, a \"Topol\"\r\nRS-12M Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM).\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday, Agriculture Minister Alexei Gordeyev, offered Iraq aid in\r\nthe form of wheat.

In retaliation, Atomic Energy\r\nMinister, Alexander Rumyantsev, exposed an Anglo-German-Dutch deal with\r\nthe Iranians, which, he said, included the sale of uranium enrichment\r\ncentrifuges.\r\n\r\nIs Putin reviving the Cold War to regain his nationalist credentials,\r\ntarnished by the positioning, unopposed, of American troops in central\r\nAsia, the unilateral American withdrawal from the Anti-Ballistic\r\nMissile (ABM) treaty and the expansion of NATO and the European Union\r\nto Russia's borders?\r\n\r\nOr, dependent as it is on energy exports, is Russia opposed to the war\r\nbecause it fears an American monopoly on the second largest known\r\nreserves of crude? Russia announced on Thursday that it would insist on\r\nhonoring all prewar contracts signed between Iraq and Russian oil\r\ncompanies and worth of billions of dollars - and on the repayment of\r\n$8-9 billion in Iraqi overdue debt to Russia.\r\n\r\nAccording to Rosbalt, every drop of $1 in oil prices translates into\r\nannual losses to the Russian treasury of $2 billion. Aggregate\r\ncorporate profits rose in January by one fifth year on year, mostly on\r\nthe strength of surging crude quotes. The Economist Intelligence Unit\r\nexpects this year's GDP to grow by 3.8 percent. Foreign exchange\r\nreserves are stable at $54 billion.\r\n\r\nThe threat to Russia's prominence and market share is not imminent.\r\nIraqi oil is unlikely to hit world markets in the next few years, as\r\nIraq's dilapidated and outdated infrastructure is rebuilt. Moreover,\r\nRussian oil is cheap compared to the North Sea or Alaskan varieties and\r\nthus constitutes an attractive investment opportunity as the recent\r\ntakeover of Tyumen Oil by British Petroleum proves. Still, the\r\nlong-term risk of being unseated by a reconstructed Iraq as the second\r\nlargest oil producer in the world is tangible.\r\n\r\nRussia has spent the last six months enhancing old alliances and\r\nconstructing new bridges. According to Interfax, the Russian news\r\nagency, yesterday, Russia has made yet another payment of $27 million\r\nto the International Monetary Fund. The Russian and Romanian prime\r\nministers met and signed bilateral agreements for the first time since\r\n1989. This week, after 12 years of abortive contacts, the republics of\r\nthe former Yugoslavia agreed with the Russian Federation on a framework\r\nfor settling its $600 million in clearing debts.\r\n\r\nRecent spats notwithstanding, the Anglo-Saxon alliance still regards\r\nRussia as a strategically crucial ally. Last week, British police, in a\r\nsudden display of unaccustomed efficacy, nabbed Russian oligarch and\r\nmortal Putin-foe, Boris Berezovsky, charged by the Kremlin with\r\ndefrauding the Samara region of $13 million while he was director of\r\nLogoVaz in 1994-5.\r\n\r\nThe Russian foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, did not remain oblivious to\r\nthese overtures. Russia and the USA remain partners, he asserted. RIA\r\nNovosti, the Russian news agency, quoted him as saying: \"If we settle\r\nthe Iraqi problem by political means and in an accord, the road will\r\nopen to teamwork on other, no less involved problems.\"\r\n\r\nAs Robert Kagan correctly observes in his essay \"Of Paradise and Power:\r\nAmerica and Europe in the New World Order\", the weaker a polity is\r\nmilitarily, the stricter its adherence to international law, the only\r\nprotection, however feeble, from bullying. Putin, presiding over a\r\ndecrepit and bloated army, naturally insists that the world must be\r\ngoverned by international regulation and not by the \"rule of the fist\".\r\n\r\nBut Kagan - and Putin - get it backwards as far as the European Union\r\nis concerned. Its members are not compelled to uphold international\r\nprescripts by their indisputable and overwhelming martial deficiency.\r\nRather, after centuries of futile bloodletting, they choose not to\r\nresort to weapons and, instead, to settle their differences\r\njuridically.\r\n\r\nThus, Putin is not a European in the full sense of the word. He\r\nsupports an international framework of dispute settlement because he\r\nhas no armed choice, not because it tallies with his deeply held\r\nconvictions and values. According to Kagan, Putin is, in essence, an\r\nAmerican: he believes that the world order ultimately rests on military\r\npower and the ability to project it.\r\n\r\nRussia aspires to be America, not France. Its business ethos, grasp of\r\nrealpolitik, nuclear arsenal and evolving values place it firmly in the\r\nAnglo-Saxon camp. Its dalliance with France and Germany is hardly an\r\nelopement. Had Russia been courted more aggressively by Secretary of\r\nState, Colin Powell and its concerns shown more respect by the American\r\nadministration, it would have tilted differently. It is a lesson to be\r\nmemorized in Washington.\r\n\r\nRussia's Second Empire\r\n\r\nBy: Dr. Sam Vaknin\r\n\r\nAlso published by United Press International (UPI)\r\n\r\nHistory teaches us little except how little we can learn from it.\r\nStill, there is nothing new under the sun. Thus, drawing too many\r\nparallels between the environmentalist movements of the late 19th\r\ncentury and their counterparts in the second half of the twentieth\r\ncentury - would probably prove misleading. Similarly, every fin de\r\nsiecle has its Fukuyama, proclaiming the end of history and the victory\r\nof liberalism and capitalism.\r\n\r\nLiberal parliamentarianism (coupled with unbridled individualistic\r\ncapitalism) seemed to irreversibly dominate the political landscape by\r\n1890 - when it was suddenly and surprisingly toppled by the confluence\r\nof revolutionary authoritarian nationalism and revolutionary\r\nauthoritarian socialism.\r\n\r\nYet, every ostensibly modern (or post-modern) phenomenon has roots and\r\nmirrors in history. The spreading of the occult, materialism,\r\nrationalism, positivism, ethnic cleansing, regionalism, municipal\r\nautonomy, environmentalism, alienation (\"ennui\"), information\r\nnetworking, globalization, anti-globalization, mass migration, capital\r\nand labour mobility, free trade - are all new mantras but very old\r\nphenomena.\r\n\r\nSometimes the parallels are both overwhelming and instructive.\r\n\r\nOverview\r\n\r\nKarl Marx regarded Louis-Napoleon's Second Empire as the first modern\r\ndictatorship - supported by the middle and upper classes but\r\nindependent of their patronage and, thus, self-perpetuating. Others\r\nwent as far as calling it proto-fascistic.\r\n\r\nYet, the Second Empire was insufficiently authoritarian or\r\nrevolutionary to warrant this title. It did foster and encourage a\r\npersonality cult, akin to the \"Fuhrerprinzip\" -but it derived its\r\nlegitimacy, conservatively, from the Church and from the electorate. It\r\nwas an odd mixture of Bonapartism, militarism, clericalism,\r\nconservatism and liberalism.\r\n\r\nIn a way, the Second Republic did amount to a secular religion, replete\r\nwith martyrs and apostles. It made use of the nascent mass media to\r\nmanipulate public opinion. It pursued industrialization and\r\nadministrative modernization. But these features characterized all the\r\npolitical movements of the late 19th century, including socialism, and\r\nother empires, such as the Habsburg Austro-Hungary.\r\n\r\nThe Second Empire was, above all, inertial. It sought to preserve the\r\nbureaucratic, regulatory, and economic frameworks of the First Empire.\r\n\r\nIt was a rationalist, positivist, and materialist movement - despite\r\nthe deliberate irrationalism of the young Louis-Napoleon. It was not\r\naffiliated to a revolutionary party, nor to popular militias.  It was\r\nnot collectivist. And its demise was the outcome of military defeat.\r\n\r\nThe Second Empire is very reminiscent of Vladimir Putin's reign in\r\npost-Yeltsin Russia.\r\n\r\nLike the French Second Empire, it follows a period of revolutions and\r\ncounter-revolutions. It is not identified with any one class but does\r\nrely on the support of the middle class, the intelligentsia, the\r\nmanagers and industrialists, the security services, and the military.\r\n\r\nPutin is authoritarian, but not revolutionary. His regime derives its\r\nlegitimacy from parliamentary and presidential elections based on a\r\nneo-liberal model of government. It is socially conservative but seeks\r\nto modernize Russia's administration and economy. Yet, it manipulates\r\nthe mass media and encourages a personality cult.\r\n\r\nDisparate Youths\r\n\r\nLike Napoleon III, Putin started off as president (he was shortly as\r\nprime minister under Yeltsin). Like him, he may be undone by a military\r\ndefeat, probably in the Caucasus or Central Asia.\r\n\r\nThe formative years of Putin and Louis-Napoleon have little in common,\r\nthough.\r\n\r\nThe former was a cosseted member of the establishment and witnessed,\r\nfirst hand, the disintegration of his country. Putin was a KGB\r\napparatchik. The KGB may have inspired, conspired in, or even\r\ninstigated the transformation in Russian domestic affairs since the\r\nearly 1980's - but to call it \"revolutionary\" would be to stretch the\r\nterm.\r\n\r\nLouis-Napoleon, on the other hand, was a true revolutionary. He\r\nnarrowly escaped death at the hands of Austrian troops in a rebellion\r\nin Italy in 1831. His brother was not as lucky. Louis-Napoleon's claim\r\nto the throne of France (1832) was based on a half-baked ideology of\r\nimperial glory, concocted, disseminated and promoted by him. In 1836\r\nand 1840 he even initiated  (failed) coups d'etat. He was expelled even\r\nfrom neutral Switzerland and exiled to the USA. He spent six years in\r\nprison.\r\n\r\nAn Eerie Verisimilitude\r\n\r\nStill, like Putin, Napoleon III was elected president. Like him, he was\r\nregarded by his political sponsors as merely a useful and disposable\r\ninstrument. Like Putin, he had no parliamentary or political\r\nexperience. Both of them won elections by promising \"order\" and\r\n\"prosperity\" coupled with \"social compassion\". And, like Putin,\r\nLouis-Napoleon, to the great chagrin of his backers, proved to be his\r\nown man - independent-minded, determined, and tough.\r\n\r\nPutin, like Louis-Napoleon before him, proceeded to expand his powers\r\nand installed loyalists in every corner of the administration and the\r\narmy. Like Louis-Napoleon, Putin is a populist, traveling throughout\r\nthe country, posing for photo opportunities, responding to citizens'\r\nqueries in Q-and-A radio shows, siding with the \"average bloke\" on\r\nevery occasion, taking advantage of Russia's previous economic and\r\nsocial disintegration to project an image of a \"strong man\".\r\n\r\nPutin is as little dependent on the Duma as Napoleon III was on his\r\nparliament. But Putin reaped what Boris Yeltsin, his predecessor, has\r\nsown when he established an imperial presidency after what amounted to\r\na coup d'etat in 1993 (the bombing of the Duma). Napoleon had to\r\norganize his own coup d'etat all by himself in 1852.\r\n\r\nThe Balancing Act\r\n\r\nNapoleon III - as does Putin now - faced a delicate balancing act\r\nbetween the legitimacy conferred by parliamentary liberalism and the\r\nneed to maintain a police state. When he sought to strengthen the\r\nenfeebled legislature he reaped only growing opposition within it to\r\nhis domestic and foreign policies alike.\r\n\r\nHe liberalized the media and enshrined in France's legal code various\r\ncivil freedoms. But he also set in motion and sanctioned a penumbral,\r\nall-pervasive and clandestine security apparatus which regularly\r\ngathered information on millions of Frenchmen and foreigners.\r\n\r\nModernization and Reform\r\n\r\nPutin is considerably less of an economic modernizer than was Napoleon\r\nIII. Putin also seems to be less interested in the social implications\r\nof his policies, in poverty alleviation and in growing economic\r\ninequalities and social tensions. Napoleon III was a man for all\r\nseasons - a buffer against socialism as well as a utopian social and\r\nadministrative reformer.\r\n\r\nBusiness flourished under Napoleon III - as it does under Putin. The\r\n1850's witnessed rapid technological change - even more rapid than\r\ntoday's. France became a popular destination for foreign investors.\r\nNapoleon III was the natural ally of domestic businessmen until he\r\nembarked on an unprecedented trade liberalization campaign in 1860.\r\nSimilarly, Putin is nudging Russia towards WTO membership and enhanced\r\nforeign competition - alienating in the process the tycoon-oligarchs,\r\nthe industrial complex, and the energy behemoths.\r\n\r\nForeign Policy\r\n\r\nNapoleon III was a free trader - as is Putin. He believed in the\r\nbeneficial economic effects of free markets and in the free exchange of\r\ngoods, capital, and labour. So does Putin. But economic liberalism does\r\nnot always translate to a pacific foreign policy.\r\n\r\nNapoleon III sought to annul the decisions of the Congress of Vienna\r\n(1815) and reverse the trend of post-Napoleonic French humiliation. He\r\nwanted to resurrect \"Great France\" pretty much as Putin wants to\r\nrestore Russia to its \"rightful\" place as a superpower.\r\n\r\nBut both pragmatic leaders realized that this rehabilitation cannot be\r\nachieved by force of arms and with a dilapidated economy. Napoleon III\r\ntried to co-opt the tidal wave of modern, revolutionary, nationalism to\r\nachieve the revitalization of France and the concomitant restoration of\r\nits glory. Putin strives to exploit the West's aversion to conflict and\r\naddiction to wealth. Napoleon III struggled to establish a new,\r\ninclusive European order - as does Putin with NATO and, to a lesser\r\ndegree, with the European Union today.\r\n\r\nPutin artfully manipulated Europe in the wake of the September 11\r\nterrorist attacks on the USA, his new found ally. He may yet find\r\nhimself in the enviable position of Europe's arbitrator, NATO's most\r\nweighty member, a bridge between Central Asia, the Caucasus, North\r\nKorea and China - and the USA.  The longer his tenure, the more likely\r\nhe is to become Europe's elder statesman. This is a maneuver\r\nreminiscent of Louis-Napoleon's following the Crimean War, when he\r\nteamed up with Great Britain against Russia.\r\n\r\nLike Putin, Napoleon III modernized and professionalized his army. But,\r\nunlike Putin hitherto, he actually went to war (against Austria), moved\r\nby his (oft-thwarted) colonial and mercantilist aspirations. Putin is\r\nlikely to follow the same path (probably in Central Asia, but,\r\npossibly, in the Baltic and east Europe as well). Reinvigorated armies\r\n(and industrialists) often force expansionary wars upon their reluctant\r\nostensible political masters.\r\n\r\nShould Putin fail in his military adventures as Napoleon III did in his\r\nand be deposed as he was - these eerie similarities will have come to\r\ntheir natural conclusion.\r\n\r\nT H E   A U T H O R\r\n\r\nSHMUEL (SAM) VAKNIN\r\n\r\nCurriculum Vitae\r\n\r\nBorn in 1961 in Qiryat-Yam, Israel.\r\n\r\nServed in the Israeli Defence Force (1979-1982) in training and\r\neducation units.\r\n\r\nEducation\r\n\r\nGraduated a few semesters in the Technion - Israel Institute of\r\nTechnology, Haifa.\r\n\r\nPh.D. in Philosophy (major : Philosophy of Physics) - Pacific Western\r\nUniversity, California.

The economics, the politics, the\r\ngeopolitics, the conspiracies, the corruption, the old and the new, the\r\nplough and the internet - it is all here, in colourful and provocative\r\nprose.\r\n\r\nFrom \"The Mind of Darkness\":\r\n\r\n\"'The Balkans' - I say - 'is the unconscious of the world'. People stop\r\nto digest this metaphor and then they nod enthusiastically. It is here\r\nthat the repressed memories of history, its traumas and fears and\r\nimages reside. It is here that the psychodynamics of humanity - the\r\ntectonic clash between Rome and Byzantium, West and East,\r\nJudeo-Christianity and Islam - is still easily discernible. We are\r\nseated at a New Year's dining table, loaded with a roasted pig and\r\nexotic salads. I, the Jew, only half foreign to this cradle of\r\nSlavonics. Four Serbs, five Macedonians. It is in the Balkans that all\r\nethnic distinctions fail and it is here that they prevail\r\nanachronistically and atavistically. Contradiction and change the only\r\ntwo fixtures of this tormented region. The women of the Balkan - buried\r\nunder provocative mask-like make up, retro hairstyles and too narrow\r\ndresses. The men, clad in sepia colours, old fashioned suits and turn\r\nof the century moustaches. In the background there is the crying game\r\nthat is Balkanian music: liturgy and folk and elegy combined. The\r\nsmells are heavy with muskular perfumes. It is like time travel. It is\r\nlike revisiting one's childhood.\"\r\n\r\nThe Author\r\n\r\nSam Vaknin is the author of Malignant Self Love - Narcissism Revisited\r\nand After the Rain - How the West Lost the East.
