Price 2 Cents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            What Peter Said.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great Cable celebration at the Crystal Palace was apparently a cut\r\nand dried affair, for the few speeches transmitted to us by the press\r\nwere not only written, but printed in advance of delivery—a comfortable\r\nmethod of reporting, very satisfactory, but not quite literal, as well\r\nas undignified in the orator of the day reading off his speech,\r\nschoolboy-like from the crown of his hat. Peter had his say, and a very\r\nfunny say it was, so much so that we are inclined to believe that\r\nArchbishop John, while “stuffing” at Long Branch, intentionally quizzed\r\nthat venerable duck. Peter, when it came to his say, was chuck full of\r\nelectricity; he sparkled and snapped like an aurora borealis; he was\r\nbetter charged than the cable, and his eloquence went off with a series\r\nof flashes like the detonations of a Leyden jar. He told us “his labors\r\nwhich required the indomitable courage, the far-seeing and electrifying\r\nmind of Cyrus W. Field to inspire and stimulate.” Cyrus then is the\r\nelectrical eel of this new era, and should be carefully preserved within\r\nnon-conductors from fear of shocking accidents. Then Peter got poetical,\r\nand travels in the great garden of the world within and the world\r\nwithout, and clothes a man there with power. This great garden could not\r\nbe that of Eden, for there nobody went clothed with anything. And then\r\nPeter got surgical, and goes into midwifery, calling the cable “the\r\numbilical cord that binds the mother continent to the child.” Then Peter\r\ngrew prophetical, and tells us what electricity will do some day or the\r\nother. And then Peter got enigmatical, and didn’t know what he did say,\r\nand then he said that language failed him, and upon this giving out he\r\nsat down and looked profound at everybody and everything for the\r\nremainder of the exercises, bestowing on the audience an occasional\r\nyawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             A New Scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo the repairs to the City Hall are to be made by the jobbing system.\r\nThe contract system, money-making as it is, is too liable to be exposed\r\nto the inspection and judgment of the people, but a large job that is\r\nsplit up into a dozen or more little ones and given out to as many\r\nindividuals, pays better, and can be more secretly conducted; therefore\r\nthis job which might be done reasonably low by a contractor, is to be\r\n_highly jobbed_ out piecemeal. Verily, we live in a great age, have\r\ngreat city fathers, an illustrious Mayor and plenty of paint and putty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Puttyman turned Merriman.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe anecdotes of great man are the treasures of local history, and are\r\ngenerally presumed to lend some light upon the trivialities of State\r\nlife. Daniel F. Tiemann is reported to have remarked, in a serious\r\nmanner it must be observed, for Daniel is thought to be a teetotaller,\r\nand rarely dons the motley, that when the Lord Mayor of London hears of\r\nour celebration and burning of the City Hall, he would return the\r\ncompliment by setting fire to the Mansion House. There can be no doubt\r\nthat this charitable ebullition of ettiquette will be accomplished, and\r\nwere it not for the extreme modesty of the worshipful Tiemann, there is\r\nlittle doubt but that his Lordship would be induced to re-enact the part\r\nof Guy Fawkes, and throw in the two houses of Parliament by way of a\r\nsuperior pyrotechnical display. The thanks of the British public are\r\nunquestionably due Puttyman for his moderation, for were he to will it,\r\nthe Atlantic Cable might require the immolation of Gog and Magog, and,\r\nperadventure, the importation of the Bow Bells. But Puttyman says he was\r\nonly joking, and in alluding to the Metropolitan edifice, intended\r\nmerely to call forth a sally of wit instead of a blaze of pure genuine\r\nflame.\r\n\r\nThe first appearance of Mr. Puttyman in his new character of Merriman,\r\nis highly creditable to a new beginner, and we have little doubt that\r\nafter a suitable intellectual training by Mr. Gossin, and a few stray\r\ntricks from Signor Carlo, he will be able to perform a creditable\r\nengagement with Dan Rice. Indeed, we do not know but with the aid of\r\nlamp-black and a dictionary, he might be converted into an excellent\r\nBrother Bones, if not a joker in all the spirit of Tom Brown, and the\r\nquaintness of the late inveterate Horn. When other occupations are gone.\r\nMr. Puttyman, from this specimen of jocularity, is entitled to a front\r\nseat in the saw dust.\r\n\r\n\r\nEUREKA.—There having been great inquiry made as to whom the statue in\r\nthe City Hall Park represents, we are happy to inform the inquisitive\r\nthat we learn by a dispatch sent us by the Atlantic Telegraph, that it\r\nis the _fac simile_ of the great Puttyman.\r\n\r\n\r\nA GREATER UNION THAN THE TELEGRAPH.—The political junction between Peter\r\nCooper and Tiemann. The cable can’t stand comparison with the cement of\r\nputty and glue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      How to Shed a Ray of Light.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the Cable demonstration on the 1st, Aldermanic politeness showed\r\nitself in its true colors by the virtual expulsion of reporters from the\r\nCrystal Palace. Immediately previously to the commencement of the\r\nexercises, Mr. Lowber, a protege of the reformer’s, whose name may be\r\nremembered in connection with a claim against the city, ordered the\r\nremoval of the tables and benches allowed to the press. Alderman Thomas\r\nMcSpedon, whose name will become famous to the press before the whole of\r\nthe documents in the Hall of Records are printed, forthwith directed the\r\nremoval of the pressgang, which, like the Joseph Walker, was held by Mr.\r\nLowber to be a nuisance. This summary proceeding was characteristic of\r\naldermanic wisdom, by forgetting that while the wide world was\r\ninterested in the cable, our astute gentleman imagined that he had it\r\nsafely coiled in his breeches pocket. Luckily all the addresses, which\r\nhad the sanction of the Common Council, were in print for a few days\r\nbefore their delivery, and that portion of our municipal greatness has\r\nescaped certain loss. Unfortunately there are two sides to a question as\r\nwell as an address, and as the British recipients of the addresses, as\r\nwell as the Captain of the Niagara, were not up to the mysteries of the\r\nTea-Room, their replies are forever lost. We have doubtless lost the\r\nwheat and secured the chaff.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRANGE, IF TRUE.—We read in the _Herald_ the other day, that, in the\r\nopinion of that oracle, the successful laying of the Trans-atlantic\r\nCable would change the whole moral aspect of human affairs—the _Herald_\r\nincluded. Now we must confess we do belong to that class of persons\r\nwhich believe that physical agency and morals are intimately allied, and\r\nthat the great achievement of submerging the cable will produce more or\r\nless a moral effect. Still we are doubtful of the _Herald_. We are\r\nequally doubtful whether the successful laying of two cables and a half\r\ndozen other scientific victories much greater than anything that has yet\r\ntranspired, could produce an improvement in the moral character of the\r\n_Herald_. Bennett is too great and too hardened a sinner. Still we have\r\nheard of repentance at the eleventh hour.\r\n\r\n\r\nA GOOD IDEA.—Our devil suggests that the great Puttyman would do well to\r\nhire Jobson to edit the _Satanic_. This might be beneficial to Puttyman,\r\nbut we doubt whether Mr. Jobson would consent to lend his brain in such\r\na filthy channel. The great French historian can do better.\r\n\r\n\r\n    ----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n                             THE ALLIGATOR.\r\n\r\n         ------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n                New York, Saturday, September 11, 1858.\r\n\r\n    ----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Out with Them.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur people have by this time purchased the significant lesson that it is\r\nimpossible to create an elective judiciary, worthy of esteem and capable\r\nof discharging the onerous functions committed to their custody. The\r\nlearned Sancho Panza observed, with respect to the impossibility of\r\ncreating silk purses out of sows’ ears. We can do likewise as to the\r\nutter inability of manufacturing judges, worthy of the ermine, from raw\r\nmaterial, such as Mr. Recorder Barnard and City Judge Russell, neither\r\nof whom would be selected to decide upon the merits of a cock fight,\r\nmuch less to determine the rights of personal liberty. Is the evil to be\r\nlonger endured, to be incessantly repeated, or are the people to take\r\nthe matter in their own hands that we may divest ourselves from the\r\nburdens which Sinbad-like we are compelled to bear on our shoulders?\r\n\r\nWe have thoroughly tested the question of an elective judiciary, both\r\ntheoretically and practically, and we have arrived at one\r\nconclusion—that we obtain politicians instead of judges, and thereby\r\njeopardize the very foundation of our national liberties. We have done\r\nmore, and openly pandered to the lowest vice in suffering the right of\r\nballot to be prostituted in order that the most unworthy of men may\r\ncreep into the judiciary. We have emptied the tap-rooms and bar-rooms of\r\ntheir tenants, and have thus sullied the dignity of the ermine. We have\r\nalso done everything in our power to neutralize the benevolent\r\nintentions of our republican institutions, by corrupting the only\r\nsafeguard for their perpetuation. And this series of calamities is\r\nchiefly attributable to the introduction of the political manœvre of\r\nrendering the judiciary elective, and thus we have sacrificed the wisdom\r\nof our revolutionary ancestors.\r\n\r\nA few years ago, when the judiciary were appointed by the State Senate,\r\nand served until physical infirmities limited the term, the New York\r\nBench were unrivalled for learning, courtesy and literary acquirements.\r\nOur criminal judges were particularly distinguished, and the name of\r\nRichard Riker, for many years Recorder of New York, will be remembered\r\nas that of a worthy and respected magistrate. Whence have we receded to\r\nsecure Russells and Barnards? Nay, we have even gone to the length of\r\ncreating offices which are perfectly useless, and filled them with idle\r\nincumbents. Will any man say that the City Court exists as a matter of\r\nnecesity, or that the duties of the officers do not belong to other\r\nauthorities? If not, why not erect a court-room and not compel its\r\npresiding dignitary to lounge a hanger-on the Court of Sessions.\r\nProbably it is better for the common weal, and more in accordance with\r\nMr. Russell’s antecedents, that he be suffered to continue in this way\r\nof life, in which the extent of mischief may be kept within limit. In\r\nthe approaching constitutional convention, the question of an elective\r\njudiciary will be fairly at issue, and it is one duty that we owe to\r\nourselves to re-organize the magistracy, that its ancient character for\r\nintegrity and truth may be revived and perpetuated. This work of\r\npurification will probably be strenuously opposed by those of our\r\npoliticians, who are dependent to the gangs of shoulder hitters, and\r\nbrothel pimps, now infecting our city and rendering the elective\r\nfranchise a political caricature. If we suffer this opportunity to\r\nescape us, we are unworthy the character of freemen, and deservedly the\r\ncellars of a judiciary, as incompent as it is useless, and as useless as\r\nit is expensive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         The Tail of the Cable.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have had our gay old time; our citizens have had fireworks, and\r\ncrackers, and cheese; our boys have had a turn-out, and our country\r\ncousins have had a most stunning display of municipal greatness,—in a\r\nword, we have glorified God, the Atlantic Cable, and the Field family.\r\nThis is all very well in its way; but when we come to pay for the\r\npiping, we naturally inquire the reason for all this fuss and\r\ncommotion—for the only thing which appears to be quiet is the cable\r\nitself, which neither works nor gives evidence of any inclination\r\ntowards labor. Now that we have had the fun, let us pay for it.\r\n\r\nThe people of England, who own the Telegraph, each end being limited to\r\nBritish soil, and the whole line under control of British capitalists,\r\nseem to have rejoiced over the success of the great event of the age in\r\na most rational and sensible manner, while we have apparently gone mad\r\nwith joy over an affair which, in nowise, can be construed into a\r\nnational subject. Degrading as it may be to our personal pride, Peter\r\nCooper, the Field family, and Archbishop John, to the contrary\r\nnotwithstanding, the Atlantic Telegraph is essentially an English\r\ntriumph; and in expending a large sum of money in an ebullition of\r\npassing insanity, our citizens have only rendered themselves subjects\r\nfor merriment. Who will deny that, although the project of an Atlantic\r\nTelegraph was first broached on this side of the Atlantic, almost the\r\nentire credit of its success has been committed to British hands. The\r\nmoney was raised in England, and three out of four vessels, engaged in\r\nthe enterprize, bore the British flag. And now have we any just excuse\r\nto run mad with joy, and to add some fifty thousand additional taxes to\r\nour already over-taxed community?\r\n\r\nThe very character of the procession which went through our streets was\r\na polite satire upon the occasion, as it can mainly be regarded as an\r\nillegal method of advertising one’s wares, which, if persisted in, would\r\nprove ruinous to the Sunday papers. We had cracker bakers, alcohol\r\ndealers, gas stoves, and all that sort of thing, from the beginning to\r\nthe end of the chapter; and one, unacquainted with the nature of\r\nmunicipal rejoicing, would conceive the demonstration to have been the\r\nAmerican Institute house-moving on the first of May. And now that the\r\nreign of folly has past, and the festivity of the occasion wasted into\r\nair, a second, sober thought suggests to us that we have been\r\nmanufacturing a very large quantity of excitement upon a very small\r\ncapital; and the more serious this consideration will become as the\r\nmoment of payment presses on us. We have no right to squander public\r\nmoneys, no more than that of embezzling from private persons; still we\r\nare well aware that a different standard of morality governs the actions\r\nof officials from those of the same beings in a mercantile character.\r\nNow that we have reached the tail of the cable excitement, let us\r\npropound a simple query: What have we gained by all this frenzy beyond\r\nthe glorification of one or two individuals, who have suddenly\r\ndiscovered themselves to be great? We have foolishly spent a large sum\r\nof money—we have made an exhibition of ourselves, and have no equivalent\r\nto show in exchange for our funds and our honor. By the tail of the\r\ncable hangs a curious tale indeed.\r\n\r\n                  ------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nTOO TRUE BY HALF.—One of our City Fathers, upon being solicited for a\r\nticket to the Cable Dinner on the 2d of September, refused, giving as a\r\nreason that he could not venture to invite any of his friends, from fear\r\nof introducing improper characters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     The Paupers at the Town Table.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf any man hangs around a public house, dependent upon the charity of\r\nvisitors for a drink, even if it be absolutely necessary to his health,\r\nhe is commonly honored with the epithet of a “bummer;” but when a highly\r\ndistinguished politician or other man, too indolent to do his own work\r\nand subsisting from the public till, hangs around the City Hall,\r\nawaiting the chances at the public table, we fail to recognize the\r\nsimilarity of his condition with the dry and athirst of the common\r\ntap-room. Now we are blind enough not to see the distinction between\r\nthese two classes of worthies, and we are stupid enough to enumerate\r\nboth as under the same category. It matters little to us whether the\r\nguzzler at the Metropolitan feeds at the public expense, or Brown at the\r\nPewter Mug drinks from the involuntary contributions of Jones or any\r\nother private individual. In both instances the principle is the same,\r\nand a man who dines at the public expense, even if it be in the name of\r\nCyrus W. Field, is as much of a sucker as the lounger who insists upon\r\nparticipating with you in a smile. They are both paupers, and should be\r\ndeservedly esteemed as such by an intelligent community. There is\r\nnothing like calling things by their proper names, although they may be\r\ndistasteful to our so-called Reformers.\r\n\r\nIt is exceedingly strange that any body of men, pretending to advocate\r\nretrenchment in our finances, will so barefacedly and undisguisedly\r\nseize upon a large sum of money belonging, as they honorably admit, to a\r\nmost over-taxed municipality, and squander it for the least profitable\r\nof animal passions. Three thousand dollars could be better expended in a\r\nmonument or other testimonial of our Cable joy, than to be guzzled down\r\nby a bevy of hungry hounds, who would have claimed boon-companionship\r\nwith Judas Iscariot to get an invitation to the Last Supper. If it be\r\nnecessary to express our joy, why not do it in a rational manner, like\r\nmen gifted with reason, and not guzzle and swill like beasts of the\r\nfield? Still the invincible selfishness of our Aldermen demanded an\r\nAldermanic banquet, whence a majority of our officials will in all\r\nprobability be carried home on a shutter, if they do not succeed in\r\nprocuring accommodations at the public expense in the Fifteenth Ward\r\nStation. Where better to end the bacchanalian revel? We had believed\r\nthat, when the iniquity of the tea-room was suppressed, and the bevy of\r\nloafers who were wont to breakfast, dine and sup from the free lunch of\r\nour Municipal tea-room, the whole fabrick of guzzling would be cast\r\ndown, so that every intelligent and reputable man would conceive it a\r\nspecies of larceny to dine at the expense of the poverty-stricken\r\ntax-payers. But that which is bred in the bone cannot come out from the\r\nskin, and this habit of dining is too deeply seated to be eradicated\r\nfrom these veterans at the public table. It would be a curious study for\r\na statician to compute the amount of groceries, wet and dry, consumed by\r\nsome of these well fed officials, and, when published, would afford a\r\nvery instructive lesson in municipal economy. We will venture to say\r\nthat Simeon Draper alone, in the course of his public services, has\r\ndeemed it a part of his duty to consume edibles and drinkables to the\r\nextent at least of three thousand dollars. Here, then, is a question for\r\ndisputation at the Institute that, if the official keep of one man costs\r\nsuch a sum, how much would it cost to support an army.\r\n\r\n                  ------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n☞ God made man, and he rested; then he made woman and rested; then he\r\ninvented the Beecher family and rested again, and then he created the\r\nField family; and there, let us hope, we come to a full stop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Fish and Fowl.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the heavy demonstrations of the Common Council, by word\r\nof mouth and by strength of lung in favor of the Atlantic Cable, it\r\nseems that the reception of the crew of the Niagara was entirely\r\noverlooked by these distinguished characters, who, in their ovations to\r\nMr. Cyrus W. Field, and such like magnates, ignored the existence of\r\nsuch a poor set of individuals as the absolute toilers, who live by the\r\nsweat of their brow. To make up for this deficiency in courtesy, a few\r\ngentlemen invited and gave a species of demonstration, wherein they\r\nexpected to realize something digestible for the poor Jacks of our navy,\r\nwho, in an humble way at least, contributed to the success of the great\r\nevent. Well, these gentlemen in hiring a room wherein the\r\nspeechification could be made, naturally stumbled upon the great Peter\r\nCooper Institute, first from the connection Peter had with the tail end\r\nof the cable, and, secondly, from the fact that they labored under the\r\nimpression that the building had been given to our municipality for the\r\nencouragement of arts and sciences, and, assuredly, what could be more\r\nencouraging to science than a hearty meal after scientific labor?\r\n\r\nThe committee waited upon the proprietor of the Institute and discovered\r\nthe nightly rent for the use of the hall of the building, so\r\nmagnanimously donated to the city, to be $100. However, the breasts of\r\nlandlords are not always of stone, and the illustrious Peter, taking\r\ninto consideration the object and the occasion, kindly consented to\r\nreceive from the friends of poor Jack but one-half the usual price for\r\nthe loan of a building, vulgarly conceived to be public property. Now\r\nwho dares to assert that Peter, the great and liberal minded Peter\r\nCooper, never does things by halves?\r\n\r\n                  ------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Cable Jollification.\r\n\r\n\r\nCyrus, the great, has been out on a fishing excursion; he has fished\r\nwith a long line, a keen hook, fine bait, and in deep water—caught a\r\nfine kettle of fish and many shiners, over which the Cooper guild and\r\ncorporation feel disposed to make themselves jolly. This may all be very\r\nwell, but to us it looks very much like using an opportunity to make a\r\ndisplay and have a good time generally to glorify somebody at the\r\nexpense of the people.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the merits of this cable, Franklin bottled lightning,\r\nMorse discovered the telegraph principle, Maury the telegraph plateau,\r\nand Cyrus, with the assistance of Brooks, put the two together, for\r\ncommercial purposes, for which Cyrus is to be glorified forever, while\r\nFranklin, Morse and Maury are forgotten. The whole cost of the cable\r\ncelebration, to the city, will not fall much short of $150,000. Cold\r\nwinter will soon be here, and thousands cold and hungry, without the\r\nmeans to supply themselves with food and fuel; and we venture to say not\r\n$500 could be raised from the corporation outside the usual\r\nappropriations, to keep them from starvation or freezing. All this is\r\nthe result of a nice little arrangement by the city fathers, who are\r\nmighty fond of guzzling at the public crib whenever an excuse can be\r\nmanufactured. This cable laying furnishes a good one, but the cable is\r\nlaid, so let “God be praised,” but not until Cyrus has had his share.\r\n\r\n                  ------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nOVERDONE.—It is now understood that the persecutors of Mr. Branch have\r\nseparated from co-partnership with Recorder Barnard, whom they charge\r\nwith having overdone matters. It is a pity, but Mr. Barnard will learn\r\nthat he cannot serve both God and man at the same time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       A Great Chance for Peter.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow that we are going to have a new story on the City Hall, would it not\r\nbe an excellent opportunity to try the highly ingenious scheme of the\r\nvenerable Peter Cooper, of converting the new portion of that public\r\nedifice into a water-tank? What a refreshing idea in the dog-days!\r\n\r\nIf Peter had only studied political economy as deeply as he has\r\nhydraulics, he might have improved his scheme of fire-extinguishing and\r\nrendered it at least self-paying, if not a source of revenue. During the\r\nsummer months, this artificial pond could be rendered an excellent\r\nbathing-school, where, beneath the supervision of some of the unoccupied\r\npolice, small boys could be allowed, at a shilling a head, to indulge in\r\na hydropathic luxury of a dive and come up again. Beyond this, during\r\nthe winter, the pond being subject, we suppose, to the ordinary\r\nafflictions of a cold, might be advantageously employed for the healthy\r\nrelaxation of skating, during which performance the venerable Peter may\r\npatronize the public by an exhibition of his highly respected person,\r\nafter the manner of his great predecessor, Wonter Von Twiller. By this\r\ningenious arrangement the great water-tank of the great Peter may be\r\nrendered as great an institution in a sanatory point of view, as his\r\nInstitute is to the intellectual world of our Atlantic Metropolis.

For cunning reforms, soft soap and putty they have\r\nno competitors. While the former has dined on politicians, the latter\r\nhas luxuriated on live alligators—of the short and long branch\r\nspecies—until they are looking fat and greasy. We advise Weed and Seward\r\nto look well to their pickets and walls at Syracuse on the 8th of\r\nSeptember, or our great city reformers will not leave them an atom of\r\npower or greatness. Let Weed remember that these great lights of\r\nMetropolitan glory, have a _peculiar_ way of doing business, unknown to\r\nthe scientific of the present day. The invention is said to be despotic\r\nand arbitrary in its sway over the masses, but this can hardly be, for\r\nour Metropolitans are clear-sighted people and would certainly have made\r\nthe discovery if such was the case; hence their popularity must\r\noriginate from the true greatness of their invention and the entire\r\napproval and encomiums of the Press during the last three or four weeks.\r\nIt is seldom that any new invention confers honor, fame and fortune upon\r\nthe inventor, but this “Branch Incarceration” invention is a new era in\r\nscience, law and philosophy. The inventors are deserving of a monument\r\nto perpetuate their memories to future posterity. Oh, great Puttyman,\r\nlittle did you think, when superintending your humble paint manufactory,\r\nthat you would ever be connected in such a great discovery. How great,\r\nhow powerful is genius—God-like. Praise God, Puttyman, that you and your\r\nfellow-inventors are not like other men.\r\n\r\n\r\nCITY HALL BELL.—This loud, cracked-toned sentinel, having become ashamed\r\nof the corruption in and round the City Hall, has left the top of that\r\ninstitution and located itself outside on a wooden tower.\r\n\r\n\r\nCENTRAL PARK.—Supposed to be completed about the year 1880—judging by\r\nthe last two years’ progress.

August 23, 1858.\r\n\r\nSIR:—Hitherto I have refrained from addressing communications to the\r\nnewspapers upon _any_ subject of interest to the community, feeling\r\nbetter satisfied in reading the comments of persons other than myself.\r\nThe course of the prosecution towards the unfortunate Mr. Branch leads\r\nme, for the first time, to speak to the public through the columns of a\r\npublic journal, and suggests to me a number of ideas which, I think,\r\nbear upon the subject. I am not a personal friend of Mr. Branch, never\r\nhaving had half a dozen words of conversation with him. I look upon the\r\nprosecution (or, more properly speaking, the persecution) of Mr. Branch\r\nas a wholesale violation of the rights and privileges of the citizens of\r\nNew York, and a violent outrage upon the spirit and tenor of our laws.\r\nFor the first time in the history of our criminal jurisprudence, we find\r\na man charged with the commission of an offence against our laws,\r\narrested, indicted, tried, convicted, sentenced, and placed in the\r\nvilest servitude, all within the space of two short weeks. In this\r\nextraordinary trial we see, and painfully too, the establishment of a\r\nprecedent to take away our rights and subject our persons and property\r\nto the ruthless grasp of an interested prosecution. ’Tis true that the\r\nprosecutors in the case of Mr. Branch were _wealthy and in positions of\r\ninfluence, and it was therefore to be expected that justice should lean\r\ntoward them_, to the taking away of the rights of a citizen who could\r\nnot boast of _wealth_. I assert, and without fear of truthful\r\ncontradiction, that two-thirds of our community to-day sympathize with\r\nMr. Branch, and look upon the course of the prosecution as a gross\r\nviolation of their own individual rights, and such a violation as loudly\r\ncalls for the indignation of the people; and it is indeed pleasant to\r\nreflect, that to-day the persecutors of Mr. Branch are entitled to, and\r\nwillingly receive, the supreme contempt and unmitigated scorn of every\r\nlover of justice; and I tell you, sir, _that_ scorn and contempt will\r\nmanifest itself at the ballot-box to such a degree, that _certain\r\npersons_ will wither beneath the loud condemnation of the honest\r\ncitizen; and the time will come when justice shall not be thwarted by\r\nthe mere wink of two or three _self-interested_ individuals, who cannot\r\nboast of any _particular merit_. I take the position, that whether Mr.\r\nBranch be guilty or _not_ guilty, the trial was unfair and the sentence\r\nunjust; and no evidence appears to my mind causing me to doubt but that\r\nMr. Branch’s assertions were correct. Would it not have been much\r\nbetter, in order to the proper vindication of the character of the\r\nperson against whom the charges were made by Mr. Branch, that all the\r\ncircumstances connected with the affair should have been brought to\r\nlight by an even-handed, above-board trial? Then, if the charges were\r\nfalse, the prosecution would have established their honor and integrity\r\nin a manner which would have satisfied the community, and not led them\r\nto look, as they now do, with suspicion. Beyond all this, Mr. Branch was\r\ndenied the right of a preliminary examination; thus showing that the\r\nfirst step taken by the prosecution was illegal and unjust. These facts,\r\nwhen presented to the mind of an enlightened public, present such\r\nformidable proof of the injustice practised towards Mr. Branch, that it\r\nis impossible to arrive at any other conclusion than that Mr. Branch has\r\nbeen more sinned against than sinning. In conclusion I shall say, that,\r\nfrom what I have discovered of public opinion, it is high time that\r\nsomething should be done to rid ourselves of the present administration,\r\nand to put in office men who can be relied upon; believing as they do\r\nthat Mr. Branch has been the victim of political persecution.\r\n\r\nLet us hope that the time will soon come when the rights of the\r\ncommunity will be preserved, and their persons and property protected by\r\nan enlightened, intelligent and honorable judiciary.\r\n\r\n                                                                  VAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           The Genuine Cable.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo single enterprise better illustrates the go-ahead-ativeness of\r\nAmericans than the purchase by Messrs. Tiffany & Co., the Broadway\r\njewellers, of the entire surplus of the Atlantic Telegraph Cable, left\r\non board the Niagara. They have no possible use for it, beyond the\r\nselling of pieces as specimens to be preserved as curiosities; and yet,\r\non this speculation they have advanced some $30,000 or $40,000 hard\r\ncash. In some cities, and some countries they would inevitably find\r\nthemselves “stuck,” as the newsboys say; but here, they will, assuredly\r\nand deservedly, reap a rich reward. They are selling the pieces, plain\r\nand mounted with _fac simile_ certificates by Mr. Field, at all prices,\r\nfrom 50 cents upwards, about as fast as they can cut them off.—_Sun._\r\n\r\nNow, of what real utility is a piece of this supposed cable? None\r\nwhatever. We strongly suspect hundreds of mechanics are employed daily\r\nin manufacturing a _fac simile_ of the Atlantic Cable, and doubtless\r\nwill continue to be so employed as long as a purchaser for a piece of\r\n“that Cable” can be found. For gullibility, New Yorkers are certainly\r\nthe _greenest_ of the human species. Still, perhaps, an imitation of\r\n“that Cable” will answer every purpose, and enrich the retailer at the\r\nexpense of the credulous. We intend to get a monster “cable”\r\nmanufactured, “to order,” to cable up our _Alligator_ o’nights.\r\n\r\n\r\nA showman giving dramatic entertainments in Lafayette, Ind., was called\r\nupon by Terrell, of the _Journal_, who tendered a bushel of corn for\r\nadmission. The manager refused to accept of it, telling Terrell that all\r\nthe members of his company had been corned for the past six weeks. Our\r\ncity fathers have been _sham_paigned and _cabled_ for the last two\r\nweeks.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur devil thinks it a national loss that the Limekiln man did not live\r\nlong enough to be elected Mayor. No doubt of it—lime is more substantial\r\nthan paint.\r\n\r\n\r\nWonder if the great Putty-man has ever paid Bennett that little bill for\r\npaint advertising? We suppose so, as Bennett is now using plenty of\r\n_varnish_ of the putty calibre.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Advertisements—25 Cents a line.\r\n\r\n\r\nCredit.—From two to four seconds, or as long as the Advertiser can hold\r\nhis breath!
