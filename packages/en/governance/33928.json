It was the 28th of June, and he had just\r\nthree francs forty centimes in his pocket to carry him to the end of the\r\nmonth. This meant the option of two dinners without lunch or two lunches\r\nwithout dinner. He reflected that as the earlier repasts cost twenty\r\nsous apiece, and the latter thirty, he would, if he were content with\r\nthe lunches, be one franc twenty centimes to the good, which would\r\nfurther represent two snacks of bread and sausage and two bocks of beer\r\non the boulevards. This latter item was his greatest extravagance and\r\nhis chief pleasure of a night; and he began to descend the Rue\r\nNotre-Dame de Lorette.\r\n\r\nHe walked as in the days when he had worn a hussar uniform, his chest\r\nthrown out and his legs slightly apart, as if he had just left the\r\nsaddle, pushing his way through the crowded street, and shouldering folk\r\nto avoid having to step aside. He wore his somewhat shabby hat on one\r\nside, and brought his heels smartly down on the pavement. He seemed ever\r\nready to defy somebody or something, the passers-by, the houses, the\r\nwhole city, retaining all the swagger of a dashing cavalry-man in civil\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nAlthough wearing a sixty-franc suit, he was not devoid of a certain\r\nsomewhat loud elegance. Tall, well-built, fair, with a curly moustache\r\ntwisted up at the ends, bright blue eyes with small pupils, and\r\nreddish-brown hair curling naturally and parted in the middle, he bore a\r\nstrong resemblance to the dare-devil of popular romances.\r\n\r\nIt was one of those summer evenings on which air seems to be lacking in\r\nParis. The city, hot as an oven, seemed to swelter in the stifling\r\nnight. The sewers breathed out their poisonous breath through their\r\ngranite mouths, and the underground kitchens gave forth to the street\r\nthrough their windows the stench of dishwater and stale sauces.\r\n\r\nThe doorkeepers in their shirtsleeves sat astride straw-bottomed chairs\r\nwithin the carriage entrances to the houses, smoking their pipes, and\r\nthe pedestrians walked with flagging steps, head bare, and hat in hand.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen George Duroy reached the boulevards he paused again, undecided as\r\nto what he should do. He now thought of going on to the Champs Elysees\r\nand the Avenue du Bois de Boulogne to seek a little fresh air under the\r\ntrees, but another wish also assailed him, a desire for a love affair.\r\n\r\nWhat shape would it take? He did not know, but he had been awaiting it\r\nfor three months, night and day. Occasionally, thanks to his good looks\r\nand gallant bearing, he gleaned a few crumbs of love here and there, but\r\nhe was always hoping for something further and better.\r\n\r\nWith empty pockets and hot blood, he kindled at the contact of the\r\nprowlers who murmur at street corners: \"Will you come home with me,\r\ndear?\" but he dared not follow them, not being able to pay them, and,\r\nbesides, he was awaiting something else, less venally vulgar kisses.\r\n\r\nHe liked, however, the localities in which women of the town\r\nswarm--their balls, their cafes, and their streets. He liked to rub\r\nshoulders with them, speak to them, chaff them, inhale their strong\r\nperfumes, feel himself near them. They were women at any rate, women\r\nmade for love. He did not despise them with the innate contempt of a\r\nwell-born man.\r\n\r\nHe turned towards the Madeleine, following the flux of the crowd which\r\nflowed along overcome by the heat. The chief cafes, filled with\r\ncustomers, were overflowing on to the pavement, and displayed their\r\ndrinking public under the dazzling glare of their lit-up facias. In\r\nfront of them, on little tables, square or round, were glasses holding\r\nfluids of every shade, red, yellow, green, brown, and inside the\r\ndecanters glittered the large transparent cylinders of ice, serving to\r\ncool the bright, clear water. Duroy had slackened his pace, a longing to\r\ndrink parched his throat.\r\n\r\n\r\nA hot thirst, a summer evening's thirst assailed him, and he fancied the\r\ndelightful sensation of cool drinks flowing across his palate. But if he\r\nonly drank two bocks of beer in the evening, farewell to the slender\r\nsupper of the morrow, and he was only too well acquainted with the hours\r\nof short commons at the end of the month.\r\n\r\nHe said to himself: \"I must hold out till ten o'clock, and then I'll\r\nhave my bock at the American cafe. Confound it, how thirsty I am\r\nthough.\" And he scanned the men seated at the tables drinking, all the\r\npeople who could quench their thirst as much as they pleased. He went\r\non, passing in front of the cafes with a sprightly swaggering air, and\r\nguessing at a glance from their dress and bearing how much money each\r\ncustomer ought to have about him. Wrath against these men quietly\r\nsitting there rose up within him. If their pockets were rummaged, gold,\r\nsilver, and coppers would be found in them. On an average each one must\r\nhave at least two louis. There were certainly a hundred to a cafe, a\r\nhundred times two louis is four thousand francs. He murmured \"the\r\nswine,\" as he walked gracefully past them. If he could have had hold of\r\none of them at a nice dark corner he would have twisted his neck without\r\nscruple, as he used to do the country-folk's fowls on field-days.\r\n\r\nAnd he recalled his two years in Africa and the way in which he used to\r\npillage the Arabs when stationed at little out-posts in the south. A\r\nbright and cruel smile flitted across his lips at the recollection of an\r\nescapade which had cost the lives of three men of the Ouled-Alane\r\ntribe, and had furnished him and his comrades with a score of fowls, a\r\ncouple of sheep, some gold, and food for laughter for six months.\r\n\r\nThe culprits had never been found, and, what is more, they had hardly\r\nbeen looked for, the Arab being looked upon as somewhat in the light of\r\nthe natural prey of the soldier.\r\n\r\nIn Paris it was another thing. One could not plunder prettily, sword by\r\nside and revolver in hand, far from civil authority. He felt in his\r\nheart all the instincts of a sub-officer let loose in a conquered\r\ncountry. He certainly regretted his two years in the desert. What a pity\r\nhe had not stopped there. But, then, he had hoped something better in\r\nreturning home. And now--ah! yes, it was very nice now, was it not?\r\n\r\nHe clicked his tongue as if to verify the parched state of his palate.\r\n\r\nThe crowd swept past him slowly, and he kept thinking. \"Set of hogs--all\r\nthese idiots have money in their waistcoat pockets.\" He pushed against\r\npeople and softly whistled a lively tune. Gentlemen whom he thus elbowed\r\nturned grumbling, and women murmured: \"What a brute!\"\r\n\r\nHe passed the Vaudeville Theater and stopped before the American cafe,\r\nasking himself whether he should not take his bock, so greatly did\r\nthirst torture him. Before making up his mind, he glanced at the\r\nilluminated clock. It was a quarter past nine. He knew himself that as\r\nsoon as the glassful of beer was before him he would gulp it down. What\r\nwould he do then up to eleven o'clock?\r\n\r\nHe passed on. \"I will go as far as the Madeleine,\" he said, \"and walk\r\nback slowly.\"\r\n\r\nAs he reached the corner of the Palace de l'Opera, he passed a stout\r\nyoung fellow, whose face he vaguely recollected having seen somewhere.\r\nHe began to follow him, turning over his recollections and repeating to\r\nhimself half-aloud: \"Where the deuce did I know that joker?\"\r\n\r\nHe searched without being able to recollect, and then all at once, by a\r\nstrange phenomenon of memory, the same man appeared to him thinner,\r\nyounger, and clad in a hussar uniform. He exclaimed aloud: \"What,\r\nForestier!\" and stepping out he tapped the other on the shoulder. The\r\npromenader turned round and looked at him, and then said: \"What is it,\r\nsir?\"\r\n\r\nDuroy broke into a laugh. \"Don't you know me?\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"George Duroy, of the 6th Hussars.\"\r\n\r\nForestier held out his hands, exclaiming: \"What, old fellow! How are\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, and you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, not very brilliant! Just fancy, I have a chest in brown paper now.\r\nI cough six months out of twelve, through a cold I caught at Bougival\r\nthe year of my return to Paris, four years ago.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Forestier, taking his old comrade's arm, spoke to him of his\r\nillness, related the consultations, opinions, and advice of the doctors,\r\nand the difficulty of following this advice in his position. He was told\r\nto spend the winter in the South, but how could he? He was married, and\r\na journalist in a good position.\r\n\r\n\"I am political editor of the _Vie Francaise_. I write the proceedings\r\nin the Senate for the _Salut_, and from time to time literary criticisms\r\nfor the _Planete_. That is so. I have made my way.\"\r\n\r\nDuroy looked at him with surprise. He was greatly changed, matured. He\r\nhad now the manner, bearing, and dress of a man in a good position and\r\nsure of himself, and the stomach of a man who dines well. Formerly he\r\nhad been thin, slight, supple, heedless, brawling, noisy, and always\r\nready for a spree. In three years Paris had turned him into someone\r\nquite different, stout and serious, and with some white hairs about his\r\ntemples, though he was not more than twenty-seven.\r\n\r\nForestier asked: \"Where are you going?\"\r\n\r\nDuroy answered: \"Nowhere; I am just taking a stroll before turning in.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, will you come with me to the _Vie Francaise_, where I have some\r\nproofs to correct, and then we will take a bock together?\"\r\n\r\n\"All right.\"\r\n\r\nThey began to walk on, arm-in-arm, with that easy familiarity existing\r\nbetween school-fellows and men in the same regiment.\r\n\r\n\"What are you doing in Paris?\" asked Forestier.\r\n\r\nDuroy shrugged his shoulders. \"Simply starving. As soon as I finished my\r\nterm of service I came here--to make a fortune, or rather for the sake\r\nof living in Paris; and for six months I have been a clerk in the\r\noffices of the Northern Railway at fifteen hundred francs a year,\r\nnothing more.\"\r\n\r\nForestier murmured: \"Hang it, that's not much!\"\r\n\r\n\"I should think not. But how can I get out of it? I am alone; I don't\r\nknow anyone; I can get no one to recommend me. It is not goodwill that\r\nis lacking, but means.\"\r\n\r\nHis comrade scanned him from head to foot, like a practical man\r\nexamining a subject, and then said, in a tone of conviction: \"You see,\r\nmy boy, everything depends upon assurance here. A clever fellow can more\r\neasily become a minister than an under-secretary. One must obtrude one's\r\nself on people; not ask things of them. But how the deuce is it that you\r\ncould not get hold of anything better than a clerk's berth on the\r\nNorthern Railway?\"\r\n\r\nDuroy replied: \"I looked about everywhere, but could not find anything.\r\nBut I have something in view just now; I have been offered a\r\nriding-master's place at Pellerin's. There I shall get three thousand\r\nfrancs at the lowest.\"\r\n\r\nForestier stopped short. \"Don't do that; it is stupid, when you ought to\r\nbe earning ten thousand francs. You would nip your future in the bud. In\r\nyour office, at any rate, you are hidden; no one knows you; you can\r\nemerge from it if you are strong enough to make your way. But once a\r\nriding-master, and it is all over. It is as if you were head-waiter at a\r\nplace where all Paris goes to dine. When once you have given riding\r\nlessons to people in society or to their children, they will never be\r\nable to look upon you as an equal.\"\r\n\r\nHe remained silent for a few moments, evidently reflecting, and then\r\nasked:\r\n\r\n\"Have you a bachelor's degree?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; I failed to pass twice.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is no matter, as long as you studied for it. If anyone mentions\r\nCicero or Tiberius, you know pretty well what they are talking about?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; pretty well.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good; no one knows any more, with the exception of a score of idiots\r\nwho have taken the trouble. It is not difficult to pass for being well\r\ninformed; the great thing is not to be caught in some blunder. You can\r\nmaneuver, avoid the difficulty, turn the obstacle, and floor others by\r\nmeans of a dictionary. Men are all as stupid as geese and ignorant as\r\ndonkeys.\"\r\n\r\nHe spoke like a self-possessed blade who knows what life is, and smiled\r\nas he watched the crowd go by. But all at once he began to cough, and\r\nstopped again until the fit was over, adding, in a tone of\r\ndiscouragement: \"Isn't it aggravating not to be able to get rid of this\r\ncough? And we are in the middle of summer. Oh! this winter I shall go\r\nand get cured at Mentone. Health before everything.\"\r\n\r\nThey halted on the Boulevard Poissoniere before a large glass door, on\r\nthe inner side of which an open newspaper was pasted. Three passers-by\r\nhad stopped and were reading it.\r\n\r\nAbove the door, stretched in large letters of flame, outlined by gas\r\njets, the inscription _La Vie Francaise_. The pedestrians passing into\r\nthe light shed by these three dazzling words suddenly appeared as\r\nvisible as in broad daylight, then disappeared again into darkness.\r\n\r\nForestier pushed the door open, saying, \"Come in.\" Duroy entered,\r\nascended an ornate yet dirty staircase, visible from the street, passed\r\nthrough an ante-room where two messengers bowed to his companion, and\r\nreached a kind of waiting-room, shabby and dusty, upholstered in dirty\r\ngreen Utrecht velvet, covered with spots and stains, and worn in places\r\nas if mice had been gnawing it.\r\n\r\n\"Sit down,\" said Forestier. \"I will be back in five minutes.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he disappeared through one of the three doors opening into the room.\r\n\r\nA strange, special, indescribable odor, the odor of a newspaper office,\r\nfloated in the air of the room. Duroy remained motionless, slightly\r\nintimidated, above all surprised. From time to time folk passed\r\nhurriedly before him, coming in at one door and going out at another\r\nbefore he had time to look at them.\r\n\r\nThey were now young lads, with an appearance of haste, holding in their\r\nhand a sheet of paper which fluttered from the hurry of their progress;\r\nnow compositors, whose white blouses, spotted with ink, revealed a clean\r\nshirt collar and cloth trousers like those of men of fashion, and who\r\ncarefully carried strips of printed paper, fresh proofs damp from the\r\npress. Sometimes a gentleman entered rather too elegantly attired, his\r\nwaist too tightly pinched by his frock-coat, his leg too well set off by\r\nthe cut of his trousers, his foot squeezed into a shoe too pointed at\r\nthe toe, some fashionable reporter bringing in the echoes of the\r\n\r\nevening.\r\n\r\nOthers, too, arrived, serious, important-looking men, wearing tall hats\r\nwith flat brims, as if this shape distinguished them from the rest of\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\nForestier reappeared holding the arm of a tall, thin fellow, between\r\nthirty and forty years of age, in evening dress, very dark, with his\r\nmoustache ends stiffened in sharp points, and an insolent and\r\nself-satisfied bearing.\r\n\r\nForestier said to him: \"Good night, dear master.\"\r\n\r\nThe other shook hands with him, saying: \"Good night, my dear fellow,\"\r\nand went downstairs whistling, with his cane under his arm.\r\n\r\nDuroy asked: \"Who is that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Jacques Rival, you know, the celebrated descriptive writer, the\r\nduellist. He has just been correcting his proofs. Garin, Montel, and he\r\nare the three best descriptive writers, for facts and points, we have in\r\nParis. He gets thirty thousand francs a year here for two articles a\r\nweek.\"\r\n\r\nAs they were leaving they met a short, stout man, with long hair and\r\nuntidy appearance, who was puffing as he came up the stairs.\r\n\r\nForestier bowed low to him. \"Norbert de Varenne,\" said he, \"the poet;\r\nthe author of '_Les Soleils Morts_'; another who gets long prices. Every\r\ntale he writes for us costs three hundred francs, and the longest do not\r\nrun to two hundred lines. But let us turn into the Neapolitan _cafe_, I\r\nam beginning to choke with thirst.\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as they were seated at a table in the _cafe_, Forestier called\r\nfor two bocks, and drank off his own at a single draught, while Duroy\r\nsipped his beer in slow mouthfuls, tasting it and relishing it like\r\nsomething rare and precious.\r\n\r\nHis companion was silent, and seemed to be reflecting. Suddenly he\r\nexclaimed: \"Why don't you try journalism?\"\r\n\r\nThe other looked at him in surprise, and then said: \"But, you know, I\r\nhave never written anything.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bah! everyone must begin. I could give you a job to hunt up information\r\nfor me--to make calls and inquiries. You would have to start with two\r\nhundred and fifty francs a month and your cab hire. Shall I speak to the\r\nmanager about it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly!\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, then, come and dine with me to-morrow. I shall only have\r\nfive or six people--the governor, Monsieur Walter and his wife, Jacques\r\nRival, and Norbert de Varenne, whom you have just seen, and a lady, a\r\nfriend of my wife. Is it settled?\"\r\n\r\nDuroy hesitated, blushing and perplexed. At length he murmured: \"You\r\nsee, I have no clothes.\"\r\n\r\nForestier was astounded. \"You have no dress clothes? Hang it all, they\r\nare indispensable, though. In Paris one would be better off without a\r\nbed than without a dress suit.\"\r\n\r\nThen, suddenly feeling in his waistcoat pocket, he drew out some gold,\r\ntook two louis, placed them in front of his old comrade, and said in a\r\ncordial and familiar tone: \"You will pay me back when you can. Hire or\r\narrange to pay by installments for the clothes you want, whichever you\r\nlike, but come and dine with me to-morrow, half-past seven, number\r\nseventeen Rue Fontaine.\"\r\n\r\nDuroy, confused, picked up the money, stammering: \"You are too good; I\r\nam very much obliged to you; you may be sure I shall not forget.\"\r\n\r\nThe other interrupted him. \"All right. Another bock, eh? Waiter, two\r\nbocks.\"\r\n\r\nThen, when they had drunk them, the journalist said: \"Will you stroll\r\nabout a bit for an hour?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly.\"\r\n\r\nAnd they set out again in the direction of the Madeleine.\r\n\r\n\"What shall we, do?\" said Forestier. \"They say that in Paris a lounger\r\ncan always find something to amuse him, but it is not true. I, when I\r\nwant to lounge about of an evening, never know where to go. A drive\r\nround the Bois de Boulogne is only amusing with a woman, and one has not\r\nalways one to hand; the _cafe_ concerts may please my chemist and his\r\nwife, but not me. Then what is there to do? Nothing. There ought to be a\r\nsummer garden like the Parc Monceau, open at night, where one would hear\r\nvery good music while sipping cool drinks under the trees. It should not\r\nbe a pleasure resort, but a lounging place, with a high price for\r\nentrance in order to attract the fine ladies. One ought to be able to\r\nstroll along well-graveled walks lit up by electric light, and to sit\r\ndown when one wished to hear the music near or at a distance. We had\r\nabout the sort of thing formerly at Musard's, but with a smack of the\r\nlow-class dancing-room, and too much dance music, not enough space, not\r\nenough shade, not enough gloom. It would want a very fine garden and a\r\nvery extensive one. It would be delightful. Where shall we go?\"\r\n\r\nDuroy, rather perplexed, did not know what to say; at length he made up\r\nhis mind. \"I have never been in the Folies Bergere. I should not mind\r\ntaking a look round there,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"The Folies Bergere,\" exclaimed his companion, \"the deuce; we shall\r\nroast there as in an oven. But, very well, then, it is always funny\r\nthere.\"\r\n\r\nAnd they turned on their heels to make their way to the Rue du Faubourg\r\nMontmartre.\r\n\r\nThe lit-up front of the establishment threw a bright light into the four\r\nstreets which met in front of it. A string of cabs were waiting for the\r\nclose of the performance.\r\n\r\nForestier was walking in when Duroy checked him.\r\n\r\n\"You are passing the pay-box,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"I never pay,\" was the reply, in a tone of importance.\r\n\r\nWhen he approached the check-takers they bowed, and one of them held out\r\nhis hand. The journalist asked: \"Have you a good box?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, Monsieur Forestier.\"\r\n\r\nHe took the ticket held out to him, pushed the padded door with its\r\nleather borders, and they found themselves in the auditorium.\r\n\r\nTobacco smoke slightly veiled like a faint mist the stage and the\r\nfurther side of the theater. Rising incessantly in thin white spirals\r\nfrom the cigars and pipes, this light fog ascended to the ceiling, and\r\nthere, accumulating, formed under the dome above the crowded gallery a\r\ncloudy sky.\r\n\r\nIn the broad corridor leading to the circular promenade a group of women\r\nwere awaiting new-comers in front of one of the bars, at which sat\r\nenthroned three painted and faded vendors of love and liquor.\r\n\r\nThe tall mirrors behind them reflected their backs and the faces of\r\npassers-by.\r\n\r\nForestier pushed his way through the groups, advancing quickly with the\r\nair of a man entitled to consideration.\r\n\r\nHe went up to a box-keeper. \"Box seventeen,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"This way, sir.\"\r\n\r\nAnd they were shut up in a little open box draped with red, and holding\r\nfour chairs of the same color, so near to one another that one could\r\nscarcely slip between them. The two friends sat down. To the right, as\r\nto the left, following a long curved line, the two ends of which joined\r\nthe proscenium, a row of similar cribs held people seated in like\r\nfashion, with only their heads and chests visible.\r\n\r\nOn the stage, three young fellows in fleshings, one tall, one of middle\r\nsize, and one small, were executing feats in turn upon a trapeze.\r\n\r\nThe tall one first advanced with short, quick steps, smiling and waving\r\nhis hand as though wafting a kiss.\r\n\r\nThe muscles of his arms and legs stood out under his tights. He expanded\r\nhis chest to take off the effect of his too prominent stomach, and his\r\nface resembled that of a barber's block, for a careful parting divided\r\nhis locks equally on the center of the skull. He gained the trapeze by a\r\ngraceful bound, and, hanging by the hands, whirled round it like a wheel\r\nat full speed, or, with stiff arms and straightened body, held himself\r\nout horizontally in space.\r\n\r\nThen he jumped down, saluted the audience again with a smile amidst the\r\napplause of the stalls, and went and leaned against the scenery, showing\r\noff the muscles of his legs at every step.\r\n\r\nThe second, shorter and more squarely built, advanced in turn, and went\r\nthrough the same performance, which the third also recommenced amidst\r\nmost marked expressions of approval from the public.\r\n\r\nBut Duroy scarcely noticed the performance, and, with head averted, kept\r\nhis eyes on the promenade behind him, full of men and prostitutes.\r\n\r\nSaid Forestier to him: \"Look at the stalls; nothing but middle-class\r\nfolk with their wives and children, good noodlepates who come to see\r\nthe show. In the boxes, men about town, some artistes, some girls, good\r\nsecond-raters; and behind us, the strangest mixture in Paris. Who are\r\nthese men? Watch them. There is something of everything, of every\r\nprofession, and every caste; but blackguardism predominates. There are\r\nclerks of all kinds--bankers' clerks, government clerks, shopmen,\r\nreporters, ponces, officers in plain clothes, swells in evening dress,\r\nwho have dined out, and have dropped in here on their way from the Opera\r\nto the Theatre des Italiens; and then again, too, quite a crowd of\r\nsuspicious folk who defy analysis. As to the women, only one type, the\r\ngirl who sups at the American _cafe_, the girl at one or two louis who\r\nlooks out for foreigners at five louis, and lets her regular customers\r\nknow when she is disengaged. We have known them for the last ten years;\r\nwe see them every evening all the year round in the same places, except\r\nwhen they are making a hygienic sojourn at Saint Lazare or at Lourcine.\"\r\n\r\nDuroy no longer heard him. One of these women was leaning against their\r\nbox and looking at him. She was a stout brunette, her skin whitened with\r\npaint, her black eyes lengthened at the corners with pencil and shaded\r\nby enormous and artificial eyebrows. Her too exuberant bosom stretched\r\nthe dark silk of her dress almost to bursting; and her painted lips, red\r\nas a fresh wound, gave her an aspect bestial, ardent, unnatural, but\r\nwhich, nevertheless, aroused desire.\r\n\r\nShe beckoned with her head one of the friends who was passing, a blonde\r\nwith red hair, and stout, like herself, and said to her, in a voice loud\r\nenough to be heard: \"There is a pretty fellow; if he would like to have\r\nme for ten louis I should not say no.\"\r\n\r\nForestier turned and tapped Duroy on the knee, with a smile. \"That is\r\nmeant for you; you are a success, my dear fellow. I congratulate you.\"\r\n\r\nThe ex-sub-officer blushed, and mechanically fingered the two pieces of\r\ngold in his waistcoat pocket.\r\n\r\nThe curtain had dropped, and the orchestra was now playing a waltz.\r\n\r\nDuroy said: \"Suppose we take a turn round the promenade.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just as you like.\"\r\n\r\nThey left their box, and were at once swept away by the throng of\r\npromenaders. Pushed, pressed, squeezed, shaken, they went on, having\r\nbefore their eyes a crowd of hats. The girls, in pairs, passed amidst\r\nthis crowd of men, traversing it with facility, gliding between elbows,\r\nchests, and backs as if quite at home, perfectly at their ease, like\r\nfish in water, amidst this masculine flood.\r\n\r\nDuroy, charmed, let himself be swept along, drinking in with\r\nintoxication the air vitiated by tobacco, the odor of humanity, and the\r\nperfumes of the hussies. But Forestier sweated, puffed, and coughed.\r\n\r\n\"Let us go into the garden,\" said he.\r\n\r\nAnd turning to the left, they entered a kind of covered garden, cooled\r\nby two large and ugly fountains. Men and women were drinking at zinc\r\ntables placed beneath evergreen trees growing in boxes.\r\n\r\n\"Another bock, eh?\" said Forestier.\r\n\r\n\"Willingly.\"\r\n\r\nThey sat down and watched the passing throng.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time a woman would stop and ask, with stereotyped smile:\r\n\"Are you going to stand me anything?\"\r\n\r\nAnd as Forestier answered: \"A glass of water from the fountain,\" she\r\nwould turn away, muttering: \"Go on, you duffer.\"\r\n\r\nBut the stout brunette, who had been leaning, just before, against the\r\nbox occupied by the two comrades, reappeared, walking proudly arm-in-arm\r\nwith the stout blonde. They were really a fine pair of women, well\r\nmatched.\r\n\r\nShe smiled on perceiving Duroy, as though their eyes had already told\r\nsecrets, and, taking a chair, sat down quietly in face of him, and\r\nmaking her friend sit down, too, gave the order in a clear voice:\r\n\"Waiter, two grenadines!\"\r\n\r\nForestier, rather surprised, said: \"You make yourself at home.\"\r\n\r\nShe replied: \"It is your friend that captivates me. He is really a\r\npretty fellow. I believe that I could make a fool of myself for his\r\nsake.\"\r\n\r\nDuroy, intimidated, could find nothing to say. He twisted his curly\r\nmoustache, smiling in a silly fashion. The waiter brought the drinks,\r\nwhich the women drank off at a draught; then they rose, and the\r\nbrunette, with a friendly nod of the head, and a tap on the arm with her\r\nfan, said to Duroy: \"Thanks, dear, you are not very talkative.\"\r\n\r\nAnd they went off swaying their trains.\r\n\r\nForestier laughed. \"I say, old fellow, you are very successful with the\r\nwomen. You must look after it. It may lead to something.\" He was silent\r\nfor a moment, and then continued in the dreamy tone of men who think\r\naloud: \"It is through them, too, that one gets on quickest.\"\r\n\r\nAnd as Duroy still smiled without replying, he asked: \"Are you going to\r\nstop any longer? I have had enough of it. I am going home.\"\r\n\r\nThe other murmured: \"Yes, I shall stay a little longer. It is not late.\"\r\n\r\nForestier rose. \"Well, good-night, then. Till to-morrow. Don't forget.\r\nSeventeen Rue Fontaine, at half-past seven.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is settled. Till to-morrow. Thanks.\"\r\n\r\nThey shook hands, and the journalist walked away.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he had disappeared Duroy felt himself free, and again he\r\njoyfully felt the two pieces of gold in his pocket; then rising, he\r\nbegan to traverse the crowd, which he followed with his eyes.\r\n\r\nHe soon caught sight of the two women, the blonde and the brunette, who\r\nwere still making their way, with their proud bearing of beggars,\r\nthrough the throng of men.\r\n\r\nHe went straight up to them, and when he was quite close he no longer\r\ndared to do anything.\r\n\r\nThe brunette said: \"Have you found your tongue again?\"\r\n\r\nHe stammered \"By Jove!\" without being able to say anything else.\r\n\r\nThe three stood together, checking the movement, the current of which\r\nswept round them.\r\n\r\nAll at once she asked: \"Will you come home with me?\"\r\n\r\nAnd he, quivering with desire, answered roughly: \"Yes, but I have only a\r\nlouis in my pocket.\"\r\n\r\nShe smiled indifferently. \"It is all the same to me,\"' and took his arm\r\nin token of possession.\r\n\r\nAs they went out he thought that with the other louis he could easily\r\nhire a suit of dress clothes for the next evening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur Forestier, if you please?\"\r\n\r\n\"Third floor, the door on the left,\" the concierge had replied, in a\r\nvoice the amiable tone of which betokened a certain consideration for\r\nthe tenant, and George Duroy ascended the stairs.\r\n\r\nHe felt somewhat abashed, awkward, and ill at ease. He was wearing a\r\ndress suit for the first time in his life, and was uneasy about the\r\ngeneral effect of his toilet. He felt it was altogether defective, from\r\nhis boots, which were not of patent leather, though neat, for he was\r\nnaturally smart about his foot-gear, to his shirt, which he had bought\r\nthat very morning for four franc fifty centimes at the Masgasin du\r\nLouvre, and the limp front of which was already rumpled. His everyday\r\nshirts were all more or less damaged, so that he had not been able to\r\nmake use of even the least worn of them.\r\n\r\nHis trousers, rather too loose, set off his leg badly, seeming to flap\r\nabout the calf with that creased appearance which second-hand clothes\r\npresent. The coat alone did not look bad, being by chance almost a\r\nperfect fit.\r\n\r\nHe was slowly ascending the stairs with beating heart and anxious mind,\r\ntortured above all by the fear of appearing ridiculous, when suddenly he\r\nsaw in front of him a gentleman in full dress looking at him. They were\r\nso close to one another that Duroy took a step back and then remained\r\nstupefied; it was himself, reflected by a tall mirror on the first-floor\r\nlanding. A thrill of pleasure shot through him to find himself so much\r\nmore presentable than he had imagined.\r\n\r\nOnly having a small shaving-glass in his room, he had not been able to\r\nsee himself all at once, and as he had only an imperfect glimpse of the\r\nvarious items of his improvised toilet, he had mentally exaggerated its\r\nimperfections, and harped to himself on the idea of appearing grotesque.\r\n\r\nBut on suddenly coming upon his reflection in the mirror, he had not\r\neven recognized himself; he had taken himself for someone else, for a\r\ngentleman whom at the first glance he had thought very well dressed and\r\nfashionable looking. And now, looking at himself carefully, he\r\nrecognized that really the general effect was satisfactory.\r\n\r\nHe studied himself as actors do when learning their parts. He smiled,\r\nheld out his hand, made gestures, expressed sentiments of astonishment,\r\npleasure, and approbation, and essayed smiles and glances, with a view\r\nof displaying his gallantry towards the ladies, and making them\r\nunderstand that they were admired and desired.\r\n\r\nA door opened somewhere. He was afraid of being caught, and hurried\r\nupstairs, filled with the fear of having been seen grimacing thus by one\r\nof his friend's guests.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the second story he noticed another mirror, and slackened\r\nhis pace to view himself in it as he went by. His bearing seemed to him\r\nreally graceful. He walked well. And now he was filled with an unbounded\r\nconfidence in himself. Certainly he must be successful with such an\r\nappearance, his wish to succeed, his native resolution, and his\r\nindependence of mind. He wanted to run, to jump, as he ascended the last\r\nflight of stairs. He stopped in front of the third mirror, twirled his\r\nmoustache as he had a trick of doing, took off his hat to run his\r\nfingers through his hair, and muttered half-aloud as he often did: \"What\r\na capital notion.\" Then raising his hand to the bell handle, he rang.\r\n\r\nThe door opened almost at once, and he found himself face to face with a\r\nman-servant out of livery, serious, clean-shaven, and so perfect in his\r\nget-up that Duroy became uneasy again without understanding the reason\r\nof his vague emotion, due, perhaps, to an unwitting comparison of the\r\ncut of their respective garments. The man-servant, who had\r\npatent-leather shoes, asked, as he took the overcoat which Duroy had\r\ncarried on his arm, to avoid exposing the stains on it: \"Whom shall I\r\nannounce?\"\r\n\r\nAnd he announced the name through a door with a looped-back draping\r\nleading into a drawing-room.\r\n\r\nBut Duroy, suddenly losing his assurance, felt himself breathless and\r\nparalyzed by terror. He was about to take his first step in the world he\r\nhad looked forward to and longed for. He advanced, nevertheless. A fair\r\nyoung woman, quite alone, was standing awaiting him in a large room,\r\nwell lit up and full of plants as a greenhouse.\r\n\r\nHe stopped short, quite disconcerted. Who was this lady who was smiling\r\nat him? Then he remembered that Forestier was married, and the thought\r\nthat this pretty and elegant blonde must be his friend's wife completed\r\nhis alarm.\r\n\r\nHe stammered: \"Madame, I am--\"\r\n\r\nShe held out her hand, saying: \"I know, sir; Charles has told me of your\r\nmeeting last evening, and I am very pleased that he had the idea of\r\nasking you to dine with us to-day.\"\r\n\r\nHe blushed up to his ears, not knowing what to say, and felt himself\r\nexamined from head to foot, reckoned up, and judged.\r\n\r\nHe longed to excuse himself, to invent some pretext for explaining the\r\ndeficiencies of his toilet, but he could not think of one, and did not\r\ndare touch on this difficult subject.\r\n\r\nHe sat down on an armchair she pointed out to him, and as he felt the\r\nsoft and springy velvet-covered seat yield beneath his weight, as he\r\nfelt himself, as it were, supported and clasped by the padded back and\r\narms, it seemed to him that he was entering upon a new and enchanting\r\nlife, that he was taking possession of something delightful, that he was\r\nbecoming somebody, that he was saved, and he looked at Madame Forestier,\r\nwhose eyes had not quitted him.\r\n\r\nShe was attired in a dress of pale blue cashmere, which set off the\r\noutline of her slender waist and full bust. Her arms and neck issued\r\nfrom a cloud of white lace, with which the bodice and short sleeves were\r\ntrimmed, and her fair hair, dressed high, left a fringe of tiny curls at\r\nthe nape of her neck.\r\n\r\nDuroy recovered his assurance beneath her glance, which reminded him,\r\nwithout his knowing why, of that of the girl met overnight at the Folies\r\nBergere. She had gray eyes, of a bluish gray, which imparted to them a\r\nstrange expression; a thin nose, full lips, a rather fleshy chin, and\r\nirregular but inviting features, full of archness and charm. It was one\r\nof those faces, every trait of which reveals a special grace, and seems\r\nto have its meaning--every movement to say or to hide something. After a\r\nbrief silence she asked: \"Have you been long in Paris?\"\r\n\r\nHe replied slowly, recovering his self-possession: \"A few months only,\r\nMadame. I have a berth in one of the railway companies, but Forestier\r\nholds out the hope that I may, thanks to him, enter journalism.\"\r\n\r\nShe smiled more plainly and kindly, and murmured, lowering her voice:\r\n\"Yes, I know.\"\r\n\r\nThe bell had rung again. The servant announced \"Madame de Marelle.\"\r\n\r\nThis was a little brunette, who entered briskly, and seemed to be\r\noutlined--modeled, as it were--from head to foot in a dark dress made\r\nquite plainly. A red rose placed in her black hair caught the eye at\r\nonce, and seemed to stamp her physiognomy, accentuate her character, and\r\nstrike the sharp and lively note needed.\r\n\r\nA little girl in short frocks followed her.\r\n\r\nMadame Forestier darted forward, exclaiming: \"Good evening, Clotilde.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good evening, Madeleine.\" They kissed one another, and then the child\r\noffered her forehead, with the assurance of a grown-up person, saying:\r\n\"Good evening, cousin.\"\r\n\r\nMadame Forestier kissed her, and then introduced them, saying: \"Monsieur\r\nGeorge Duroy, an old friend of Charles; Madame de Marelle, my friend,\r\nand in some degree my relation.\" She added: \"You know we have no\r\nceremonious affectation here. You quite understand, eh?\"\r\n\r\nThe young man bowed.\r\n\r\nThe door opened again, and a short, stout gentleman appeared, having on\r\nhis arm a tall, handsome woman, much younger than himself, and of\r\ndistinguished appearance and grave bearing. They were Monsieur Walter, a\r\nJew from the South of France, deputy, financier, capitalist, and manager\r\nof the _Vie Francaise_, and his wife, the daughter of Monsieur\r\nBasile-Ravalau, the banker.\r\n\r\nThen came, one immediately after the other, Jacques Rival, very\r\nelegantly got up, and Norbert de Varenne, whose coat collar shone\r\nsomewhat from the friction of the long locks falling on his shoulders\r\nand scattering over them a few specks of white scurf. His badly-tied\r\ncravat looked as if it had already done duty. He advanced with the air\r\nand graces of an old beau, and taking Madame Forestier's hand, printed a\r\nkiss on her wrist. As he bent forward his long hair spread like water\r\nover her bare arm.\r\n\r\nForestier entered in his turn, offering excuses for being late. He had\r\nbeen detained at the office of the paper by the Morel affair. Monsieur\r\nMorel, a Radical deputy, had just addressed a question to the Ministry\r\nrespecting a vote of credit for the colonization of Algeria.\r\n\r\nThe servant announced: \"Dinner is served, Madame,\" and they passed into\r\nthe dining-room.\r\n\r\nDuroy found himself seated between Madame de Marelle and her daughter.\r\nHe again felt ill at ease, being afraid of making some mistake in the\r\nconventional handling of forks, spoons, and glasses. There were four of\r\nthese, one of a faint blue tint. What could be meant to be drunk out of\r\nthat?\r\n\r\nNothing was said while the soup was being consumed, and then Norbert de\r\nVarenne asked: \"Have you read the Gauthier case? What a funny business\r\nit is.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a discussion on this case of adultery, complicated with\r\nblackmailing, followed. They did not speak of it as the events recorded\r\nin newspapers are spoken of in private families, but as a disease is\r\nspoken of among doctors, or vegetables among market gardeners. They were\r\nneither shocked nor astonished at the facts, but sought out their hidden\r\nand secret motives with professional curiosity, and an utter\r\nindifference for the crime itself. They sought to clearly explain the\r\norigin of certain acts, to determine all the cerebral phenomena which\r\nhad given birth to the drama, the scientific result due to an especial\r\ncondition of mind. The women, too, were interested in this\r\ninvestigation. And other recent events were examined, commented upon,\r\nturned so as to show every side of them, and weighed correctly, with the\r\npractical glance, and from the especial standpoint of dealers in news,\r\nand vendors of the drama of life at so much a line, just as articles\r\ndestined for sale are examined, turned over, and weighed by tradesmen.\r\n\r\nThen it was a question of a duel, and Jacques Rival spoke. This was his\r\nbusiness; no one else could handle it.\r\n\r\nDuroy dared not put in a word. He glanced from time to time at his\r\nneighbor, whose full bosom captivated him. A diamond, suspended by a\r\nthread of gold, dangled from her ear like a drop of water that had\r\nrolled down it. From time to time she made an observation which always\r\nbrought a smile to her hearers' lips. She had a quaint, pleasant wit,\r\nthat of an experienced tomboy who views things with indifference and\r\njudges them with frivolous and benevolent skepticism.\r\n\r\nDuroy sought in vain for some compliment to pay her, and, not finding\r\none, occupied himself with her daughter, filling her glass, holding her\r\nplate, and helping her. The child, graver than her mother, thanked him\r\nin a serious tone and with a slight bow, saying: \"You are very good,\r\nsir,\" and listened to her elders with an air of reflection.\r\n\r\nThe dinner was very good, and everyone was enraptured. Monsieur Walter\r\nate like an ogre, hardly spoke, and glanced obliquely under his glasses\r\nat the dishes offered to him. Norbert de Varenne kept him company, and\r\nfrom time to time let drops of gravy fall on his shirt front. Forestier,\r\nsilent and serious, watched everything, exchanging glances of\r\nintelligence with his wife, like confederates engaged together on a\r\ndifficult task which is going on swimmingly.\r\n\r\nFaces grew red, and voices rose, as from time to time the man-servant\r\nmurmured in the guests' ears: \"Corton or Chateau-Laroze.\"\r\n\r\nDuroy had found the Corton to his liking, and let his glass be filled\r\nevery time. A delicious liveliness stole over him, a warm cheerfulness,\r\nthat mounted from the stomach to the head, flowed through his limbs and\r\npenetrated him throughout. He felt himself wrapped in perfect comfort of\r\nlife and thought, body and soul.\r\n\r\nA longing to speak assailed him, to bring himself into notice, to be\r\nappreciated like these men, whose slightest words were relished.\r\n\r\nBut the conversation, which had been going on unchecked, linking ideas\r\none to another, jumping from one topic to another at a chance word, a\r\nmere trifle, and skimming over a thousand matters, turned again on the\r\ngreat question put by Monsieur Morel in the Chamber respecting the\r\ncolonization of Algeria.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Walter, between two courses, made a few jests, for his wit was\r\nskeptical and broad. Forestier recited his next day's leader. Jacques\r\nRival insisted on a military government with land grants to all officers\r\nafter thirty years of colonial service.\r\n\r\n\"By this plan,\" he said, \"you will create an energetic class of\r\ncolonists, who will have already learned to love and understand the\r\ncountry, and will be acquainted with its language, and with all those\r\ngrave local questions against which new-comers invariably run their\r\nheads.\"\r\n\r\nNorbert de Varenne interrupted him with: \"Yes; they will be acquainted\r\nwith everything except agriculture. They will speak Arabic, but they\r\nwill be ignorant how beet-root is planted out and wheat sown. They will\r\nbe good at fencing, but very shaky as regards manures. On the contrary,\r\nthis new land should be thrown entirely open to everyone. Intelligent\r\nmen will achieve a position there; the others will go under. It is the\r\nsocial law.\"\r\n\r\nA brief silence followed, and the listeners smiled at one another.\r\n\r\nGeorge Duroy opened his mouth, and said, feeling as much surprised at\r\nthe sound of his own voice as if he had never heard himself speak: \"What\r\nis most lacking there is good land. The really fertile estates cost as\r\nmuch as in France, and are bought up as investments by rich Parisians.\r\nThe real colonists, the poor fellows who leave home for lack of bread,\r\nare forced into the desert, where nothing will grow for want of water.\"\r\n\r\nEveryone looked at him, and he felt himself blushing.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Walter asked: \"Do you know Algeria, sir?\"\r\n\r\nGeorge replied: \"Yes, sir; I was there nearly two years and a half, and\r\nI was quartered in all three provinces.\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly unmindful of the Morel question, Norbert de Varenne\r\ninterrogated him respecting a detail of manners and customs of which he\r\nhad been informed by an officer. It was with respect to the Mzab, that\r\nstrange little Arab republic sprung up in the midst of the Sahara, in\r\nthe driest part of that burning region.\r\n\r\nDuroy had twice visited the Mzab, and he narrated some of the customs of\r\nthis singular country, where drops of water are valued as gold; where\r\nevery inhabitant is bound to discharge all public duties; and where\r\ncommercial honesty is carried further than among civilized nations.\r\n\r\nHe spoke with a certain raciness excited by the wine and the desire to\r\nplease, and told regimental yarns, incidents of Arab life and military\r\nadventure. He even hit on some telling phrases to depict these bare and\r\nyellow lands, eternally laid waste by the devouring fire of the sun.\r\n\r\nAll the women had their eyes turned upon him, and Madame Walter said, in\r\nher deliberate tones: \"You could make a charming series of articles out\r\nof your recollections.\"\r\n\r\nThen Walter looked at the young fellow over the glasses of his\r\nspectacles, as was his custom when he wanted to see anyone's face\r\ndistinctly. He looked at the dishes underneath them.\r\n\r\nForestier seized the opportunity. \"My dear sir, I had already spoken to\r\nyou about Monsieur George Duroy, asking you to let me have him for my\r\nassistant in gleaning political topics. Since Marambot left us, I have\r\nno one to send in quest of urgent and confidential information, and the\r\npaper suffers from it.\"\r\n\r\nDaddy Walter became serious, and pushed his spectacles upon his\r\nforehead, in order to look Duroy well in the face. Then he said: \"It is\r\ntrue that Monsieur Duroy has evidently an original turn of thought. If\r\nhe will come and have a chat with us to-morrow at three o'clock, we will\r\nsettle the matter.\" Then, after a short silence, turning right round\r\ntowards George, he added: \"But write us a little fancy series of\r\narticles on Algeria at once. Relate your experiences, and mix up the\r\ncolonization question with them as you did just now. They are facts,\r\ngenuine facts, and I am sure they will greatly please our readers. But\r\nbe quick. I must have the first article to-morrow or the day after,\r\nwhile the subject is being discussed in the Chamber, in order to catch\r\nthe public.\"\r\n\r\nMadame Walter added, with that serious grace which characterized\r\neverything she did, and which lent an air of favor to her words: \"And\r\nyou have a charming title, 'Recollections of a Chasseur d'Afrique.' Is\r\nit not so, Monsieur Norbert?\"\r\n\r\nThe old poet, who had worn renown late in life, feared and hated\r\nnew-comers. He replied dryly: \"Yes, excellent, provided that the keynote\r\nbe followed, for that is the great difficulty; the exact note, what in\r\nmusic is called the pitch.\"\r\n\r\nMadame Forestier cast on Duroy a smiling and protective glance, the\r\nglance of a connoisseur, which seemed to say: \"Yes, you will get on.\"\r\nMadame de Marelle had turned towards him several times, and the diamond\r\nin her ear quivered incessantly as though the drop of water was about to\r\nfall.\r\n\r\nThe little girl remained quiet and serious, her head bent over her\r\nplate.\r\n\r\nBut the servant passed round the table, filling the blue glasses with\r\nJohannisberg, and Forestier proposed a toast, drinking with a bow to\r\nMonsieur Walter: \"Prosperity to the _Vie Francaise_.\"\r\n\r\nEveryone bowed towards the proprietor, who smiled, and Duroy,\r\nintoxicated with success, emptied his glass at a draught. He would have\r\nemptied a whole barrel after the same fashion; it seemed to him that he\r\ncould have eaten a bullock or strangled a lion. He felt a superhuman\r\nstrength in his limbs, unconquerable resolution and unbounded hope in\r\nhis mind. He was now at home among these people; he had just taken his\r\nposition, won his place. His glance rested on their faces with a\r\nnew-born assurance, and he ventured for the first time to address his\r\nneighbor. \"You have the prettiest earrings I have ever seen, Madame.\"\r\n\r\nShe turned towards him with a smile. \"It was an idea of my own to have\r\nthe diamonds hung like that, just at the end of a thread. They really\r\nlook like dew-drops, do they not?\"\r\n\r\nHe murmured, ashamed of his own daring, and afraid of making a fool of\r\nhimself:\r\n\r\n\"It is charming; but the ear, too, helps to set it off.\"\r\n\r\nShe thanked him with a look, one of those woman's looks that go straight\r\nto the heart. And as he turned his head he again met Madame Forestier's\r\neye, always kindly, but now he thought sparkling with a livelier mirth,\r\nan archness, an encouragement.\r\n\r\nAll the men were now talking at once with gesticulations and raised\r\nvoices. They were discussing the great project of the metropolitan\r\nrailway. The subject was not exhausted till dessert was finished,\r\neveryone having a deal to say about the slowness of the methods of\r\ncommunication in Paris, the inconvenience of the tramway, the delays of\r\nomnibus traveling, and the rudeness of cabmen.\r\n\r\nThen they left the dining-room to take coffee. Duroy, in jest, offered\r\nhis arm to the little girl. She gravely thanked him, and rose on tiptoe\r\nin order to rest her hand on it.\r\n\r\nOn returning to the drawing-room he again experienced the sensation of\r\nentering a greenhouse. In each of the four corners of the room tall\r\npalms unfolded their elegantly shaped leaves, rising to the ceiling, and\r\nthere spreading fountain-wise.\r\n\r\nOn each side of the fireplace were india-rubber plants like round\r\ncolumns, with their dark green leaves tapering one above the other; and\r\non the piano two unknown shrubs covered with flowers, those of one all\r\ncrimson and those of the other all white, had the appearance of\r\nartificial plants, looking too beautiful to be real.\r\n\r\nThe air was cool, and laden with a soft, vague perfume that could\r\nscarcely be defined. The young fellow, now more himself, considered the\r\nroom more attentively. It was not large; nothing attracted attention\r\nwith the exception of the shrubs, no bright color struck one, but one\r\nfelt at one's ease in it; one felt soothed and refreshed, and, as it\r\nwere, caressed by one's surroundings. The walls were covered with an\r\nold-fashioned stuff of faded violet, spotted with little flowers in\r\nyellow silk about the size of flies. Hangings of grayish-blue cloth,\r\nembroidered here and there with crimson poppies, draped the doorways,\r\nand the chairs of all shapes and sizes, scattered about the room,\r\nlounging chairs, easy chairs, ottomans, and stools, were upholstered in\r\nLouise Seize silk or Utrecht velvet, with a crimson pattern on a\r\ncream-colored ground.\r\n\r\n\"Do you take coffee, Monsieur Duroy?\" and Madame Forestier held out a\r\ncup towards him with that smile which never left her lips.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, Madame.\" He took the cup, and as he bent forward to take a\r\nlump of sugar from the sugar-basin carried by the little girl, Madame\r\nForestier said to him in a low voice: \"Pay attention to Madame Walter.\"\r\n\r\nThen she drew back before he had time to answer a word.\r\n\r\nHe first drank off his coffee, which he was afraid of dropping onto the\r\ncarpet; then, his mind more at ease, he sought for some excuse to\r\napproach the wife of his new governor, and begin a conversation. All at\r\nonce he noticed that she was holding an empty cup in her hand, and as\r\nshe was at some distance from a table, did not know where to put it. He\r\ndarted forward with, \"Allow me, Madame?\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, sir.\"\r\n\r\nHe took away the cup and then returned.\r\n\r\n\"If you knew, Madame,\" he began, \"the happy hours the _Vie Francaise_\r\nhelped me to pass when I was away in the desert. It is really the only\r\npaper that is readable out of France, for it is more literary, wittier,\r\nand less monotonous than the others. There is something of everything in\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nShe smiled with amiable indifference, and answered, seriously:\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur Walter has had a great deal of trouble to create a type of\r\nnewspaper supplying the want of the day.\"\r\n\r\nAnd they began to chat. He had an easy flow of commonplace conversation,\r\na charm in his voice and look, and an irresistible seductiveness about\r\nhis moustache. It curled coquettishly about his lips, reddish brown,\r\nwith a paler tint about the ends. They chatted about Paris, its suburbs,\r\nthe banks of the Seine, watering places, summer amusements, all the\r\ncurrent topics on which one can prate to infinity without wearying\r\noneself.\r\n\r\nThen as Monsieur Norbert de Varenne approached with a liqueur glass in\r\nhis hand, Duroy discreetly withdrew.\r\n\r\nMadame de Marelle, who had been speaking with Madame Forestier, summoned\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir,\" she said, abruptly, \"so you want to try your hand at\r\njournalism?\"\r\n\r\nHe spoke vaguely of his prospects, and there recommenced with her the\r\nconversation he had just had with Madame Walter, but as he was now a\r\nbetter master of his subject, he showed his superiority in it, repeating\r\nas his own the things he had just heard. And he continually looked his\r\ncompanion in the eyes, as though to give deep meaning to what he was\r\nsaying.\r\n\r\nShe, in her turn, related anecdotes with the easy flow of spirits of a\r\nwoman who knows she is witty, and is always seeking to appear so, and\r\nbecoming familiar, she laid her hand from time to time on his arm, and\r\nlowered her voice to make trifling remarks which thus assumed a\r\ncharacter of intimacy. He was inwardly excited by her contact. He would\r\nhave liked to have shown his devotion for her on the spot, to have\r\ndefended her, shown her what he was worth, and his delay in his replies\r\nto her showed the preoccupation of his mind.\r\n\r\nBut suddenly, without any reason, Madame de Marelle called, \"Laurine!\"\r\nand the little girl came.\r\n\r\n\"Sit down here, child; you will catch cold near the window.\"\r\n\r\nDuroy was seized with a wild longing to kiss the child. It was as though\r\nsome part of the kiss would reach the mother.\r\n\r\nHe asked in a gallant, and at the same time fatherly, tone: \"Will you\r\nallow me to kiss you, Mademoiselle?\"\r\n\r\nThe child looked up at him in surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Answer, my dear,\" said Madame de Marelle, laughingly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir, this time; but it will not do always.\"\r\n\r\nDuroy, sitting down, lifted Laurine onto his knees and brushed the fine\r\ncurly hair above her forehead with his lips.\r\n\r\nHer mother was surprised. \"What! she has not run away; it is astounding.\r\nUsually she will only let ladies kiss her. You are irresistible,\r\nMonsieur Duroy.\"\r\n\r\nHe blushed without answering, and gently jogged the little girl on his\r\nknee.\r\n\r\nMadame Forestier drew near, and exclaimed, with astonishment: \"What,\r\nLaurine tamed! What a miracle!\"\r\n\r\nJacques Rival also came up, cigar in mouth, and Duroy rose to take\r\nleave, afraid of spoiling, by some unlucky remark, the work done, his\r\ntask of conquest begun.\r\n\r\nHe bowed, softly pressed the little outstretched hands of the women, and\r\nthen heartily shook those of the men. He noted that the hand of Jacques\r\nRival, warm and dry, answered cordially to his grip; that of Norbert de\r\nVarenne, damp and cold, slipped through his fingers; that of Daddy\r\nWalter, cold and flabby, was without expression or energy; and that of\r\nForestier was plump and moist. His friend said to him in a low tone,\r\n\"To-morrow, at three o'clock; do not forget.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! no; don't be afraid of that.\"\r\n\r\nWhen he found himself once more on the stairs he felt a longing to run\r\ndown them, so great was his joy, and he darted forward, going down two\r\nsteps at a time, but suddenly he caught sight in a large mirror on the\r\nsecond-floor landing of a gentleman in a hurry, who was advancing\r\nbriskly to meet him, and he stopped short, ashamed, as if he had been\r\ncaught tripping. Then he looked at himself in the glass for some time,\r\nastonished at being really such a handsome fellow, smiled complacently,\r\nand taking leave of his reflection, bowed low to it as one bows to a\r\npersonage of importance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen George Duroy found himself in the street he hesitated as to what he\r\nshould do. He wanted to run, to dream, to walk about thinking of the\r\nfuture as he breathed the soft night air, but the thought of the series\r\nof articles asked for by Daddy Walter haunted him, and he decided to go\r\nhome at once and set to work.\r\n\r\nHe walked along quickly, reached the outer boulevards, and followed\r\ntheir line as far as the Rue Boursault, where he dwelt. The house, six\r\nstories high, was inhabited by a score of small households,\r\ntrades-people or workmen, and he experienced a sickening sensation of\r\ndisgust, a longing to leave the place and live like well-to-do people in\r\na clean dwelling, as he ascended the stairs, lighting himself with wax\r\nmatches on his way up the dirty steps, littered with bits of paper,\r\ncigarette ends, and scraps of kitchen refuse. A stagnant stench of\r\ncooking, cesspools and humanity, a close smell of dirt and old walls,\r\nwhich no rush of air could have driven out of the building, filled it\r\nfrom top to bottom.\r\n\r\nThe young fellow's room, on the fifth floor, looked into a kind of\r\nabyss, the huge cutting of the Western Railway just above the outlet by\r\nthe tunnel of the Batignolles station. Duroy opened his window and\r\nleaned against the rusty iron cross-bar.\r\n\r\nBelow him, at the bottom of the dark hole, three motionless red lights\r\nresembled the eyes of huge wild animals, and further on a glimpse could\r\nbe caught of others, and others again still further. Every moment\r\nwhistles, prolonged or brief, pierced the silence of the night, some\r\nnear at hand, others scarcely discernible, coming from a distance from\r\nthe direction of Asnieres. Their modulations were akin to those of the\r\nhuman voice. One of them came nearer and nearer, with its plaintive\r\nappeal growing louder and louder every moment, and soon a big yellow\r\nlight appeared advancing with a loud noise, and Duroy watched the\r\nstring of railway carriages swallowed up by the tunnel.\r\n\r\nThen he said to himself: \"Come, let's go to work.\"\r\n\r\nHe placed his light upon the table, but at the moment of commencing he\r\nfound that he had only a quire of letter paper in the place. More the\r\npity, but he would make use of it by opening out each sheet to its full\r\nextent. He dipped his pen in ink, and wrote at the head of the page, in\r\nhis best hand, \"Recollections of a Chasseur d'Afrique.\"\r\n\r\nThen he tried to frame the opening sentence. He remained with his head\r\non his hands and his eyes fixed on the white sheet spread out before\r\nhim. What should he say? He could no longer recall anything of what he\r\nhad been relating a little while back; not an anecdote, not a fact,\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nAll at once the thought struck him: \"I must begin with my departure.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he wrote: \"It was in 1874, about the middle of May, when France, in\r\nher exhaustion, was reposing after the catastrophe of the terrible\r\nyear.\"\r\n\r\nHe stopped short, not knowing how to lead up to what should follow--his\r\nembarkation, his voyage, his first impressions.\r\n\r\nAfter ten minutes' reflection, he resolved to put off the introductory\r\nslip till to-morrow, and to set to work at once to describe Algiers.\r\n\r\nAnd he traced on his paper the words: \"Algiers is a white city,\" without\r\nbeing able to state anything further. He recalled in his mind the pretty\r\nwhite city flowing down in a cascade of flat-roofed dwellings from the\r\nsummit of its hills to the sea, but he could no longer find a word to\r\nexpress what he had seen and felt.\r\n\r\nAfter a violent effort, he added: \"It is partly inhabited by Arabs.\"\r\n\r\nThen he threw down his pen and rose from his chair.\r\n\r\nOn his little iron bedstead, hollowed in the center by the pressure of\r\nhis body, he saw his everyday garments cast down there, empty, worn,\r\nlimp, ugly as the clothing at the morgue. On a straw-bottomed chair his\r\ntall hat, his only one, brim uppermost, seemed to be awaiting an alms.\r\n\r\nThe wall paper, gray with blue bouquets, showed as many stains as\r\nflowers, old suspicious-looking stains, the origin of which could not be\r\ndefined; crushed insects or drops of oil; finger tips smeared with\r\npomatum or soapy water scattered while washing. It smacked of shabby,\r\ngenteel poverty, the poverty of a Paris lodging-house. Anger rose within\r\nhim at the wretchedness of his mode of living. He said to himself that\r\nhe must get out of it at once; that he must finish with this irksome\r\nexistence the very next day.\r\n\r\nA frantic desire of working having suddenly seized on him again, he sat\r\ndown once more at the table, and began anew to seek for phrases to\r\ndescribe the strange and charming physiognomy of Algiers, that ante-room\r\n\r\nof vast and mysterious Africa; the Africa of wandering Arabs and unknown\r\ntribes of negroes; that unexplored Africa of which we are sometimes\r\nshown in public gardens the improbable-looking animals seemingly made to\r\nfigure in fairy tales; the ostriches, those exaggerated fowls; the\r\ngazelles, those divine goats; the surprising and grotesque giraffes; the\r\ngrave-looking camels, the monstrous hippopotomi, the shapeless\r\nrhinosceri, and the gorillas, those frightful-looking brothers of\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\nHe vaguely felt ideas occurring to him; he might perhaps have uttered\r\nthem, but he could not put them into writing. And his impotence\r\nexasperated him, he got up again, his hands damp with perspiration, and\r\nhis temples throbbing.\r\n\r\nHis eyes falling on his washing bill, brought up that evening by the\r\nconcierge, he was suddenly seized with wild despair. All his joy\r\nvanishing in a twinkling, with his confidence in himself and his faith\r\nin the future. It was all up; he could not do anything, he would never\r\nbe anybody; he felt played out, incapable, good for nothing, damned.\r\n\r\nAnd he went and leaned out of the window again, just as a train issued\r\nfrom the tunnel with a loud and violent noise. It was going away, afar\r\noff, across the fields and plains towards the sea. And the recollection\r\nof his parents stirred in Duroy's breast. It would pass near them, that\r\ntrain, within a few leagues of their house. He saw it again, the little\r\nhouse at the entrance to the village of Canteleu, on the summit of the\r\nslope overlooking Rouen and the immense valley of the Seine.\r\n\r\nHis father and mother kept a little inn, a place where the tradesfolk of\r\nthe suburbs of Rouen came out to lunch on Sunday at the sign of the\r\nBelle Vue. They had wanted to make a gentleman of their son, and had\r\nsent him to college. Having finished his studies, and been plowed for\r\nhis bachelor's degree, he had entered on his military service with the\r\nintention of becoming an officer, a colonel, a general. But, disgusted\r\nwith military life long before the completion of his five years' term\r\nof service, he had dreamed of making a fortune at Paris.\r\n\r\nHe came there at the expiration of his term of service, despite the\r\nentreaties of his father and mother, whose visions having evaporated,\r\nwanted now to have him at home with them. In his turn he hoped to\r\nachieve a future; he foresaw a triumph by means as yet vaguely defined\r\nin his mind, but which he felt sure he could scheme out and further.\r\n\r\nHe had had some successful love affairs in the regiment, some easy\r\nconquests, and even some adventures in a better class of society, having\r\nseduced a tax collector's daughter, who wanted to leave her home for his\r\nsake, and a lawyer's wife, who had tried to drown herself in despair at\r\nbeing abandoned.\r\n\r\nHis comrades used to say of him: \"He is a sharp fellow, a deep one to\r\nget out of a scrape, a chap who knows which side his bread is buttered,\"\r\nand he had promised himself to act up to this character.\r\n\r\nHis conscience, Norman by birth, worn by the daily dealings of garrison\r\nlife, rendered elastic by the examples of pillaging in Africa, illicit\r\ncommissions, shaky dodges; spurred, too, by the notions of honor current\r\nin the army, military bravadoes, patriotic sentiments, the fine-sounding\r\ntales current among sub-officers, and the vain glory of the profession\r\nof arms, had become a kind of box of tricks in which something of\r\neverything was to be found.\r\n\r\nBut the wish to succeed reigned sovereign in it.\r\n\r\nHe had, without noticing it, began to dream again as he did every\r\nevening. He pictured to himself some splendid love adventure which\r\nshould bring about all at once the realization of his hopes. He married\r\nthe daughter of some banker or nobleman met with in the street, and\r\ncaptivated at the first glance.\r\n\r\nThe shrill whistle of a locomotive which, issuing from the tunnel like a\r\nbig rabbit bolting out of its hole, and tearing at full speed along the\r\nrails towards the machine shed where it was to take its rest, awoke him\r\nfrom his dream.\r\n\r\nThen, repossessed by the vague and joyful hope which ever haunted his\r\nmind, he wafted a kiss into the night, a kiss of love addressed to the\r\nvision of the woman he was awaiting, a kiss of desire addressed to the\r\nfortune he coveted. Then he closed his window and began to undress,\r\nmurmuring:\r\n\r\n\"I shall feel in a better mood for it to-morrow. My thoughts are not\r\nclear to-night. Perhaps, too, I have had just a little too much to\r\ndrink. One can't work well under those circumstances.\"\r\n\r\nHe got into bed, blew out his light, and went off to sleep almost\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nHe awoke early, as one awakes on mornings of hope and trouble, and\r\njumping out of bed, opened his window to drink a cup of fresh air, as he\r\nphrased it.\r\n\r\nThe houses of the Rue de Rome opposite, on the other side of the broad\r\nrailway cutting, glittering in the rays of the rising sun, seemed to be\r\npainted with white light. Afar off on the right a glimpse was caught of\r\nthe slopes of Argenteuil, the hills of Sannois, and the windmills of\r\nOrgemont through a light bluish mist; like a floating and transparent\r\nveil cast onto the horizon.\r\n\r\nDuroy remained for some minutes gazing at the distant country side, and\r\nhe murmured: \"It would be devilish nice out there a day like this.\" Then\r\nhe bethought himself that he must set to work, and that at once, and\r\nalso send his concierge's lad, at a cost of ten sous, to the office to\r\nsay that he was ill.\r\n\r\nHe sat down at his table, dipped his pen in the ink, leaned his forehead\r\non his hand, and sought for ideas. All in vain, nothing came.\r\n\r\nHe was not discouraged, however. He thought, \"Bah! I am not accustomed\r\nto it. It is a trade to be learned like all other trades. I must have\r\nsome help the first time. I will go and find Forestier, who will give me\r\na start for my article in ten minutes.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he dressed himself.\r\n\r\nWhen he got into the street he came to the conclusion that it was still\r\ntoo early to present himself at the residence of his friend, who must be\r\na late sleeper. He therefore walked slowly along beneath the trees of\r\nthe outer boulevards. It was not yet nine o'clock when he reached the\r\nParc Monceau, fresh from its morning watering. Sitting down upon a bench\r\nhe began to dream again. A well-dressed young man was walking up and\r\ndown at a short distance, awaiting a woman, no doubt. Yes, she appeared,\r\nclose veiled and quick stepping, and taking his arm, after a brief clasp\r\nof the hand, they walked away together.\r\n\r\nA riotous need of love broke out in Duroy's heart, a need of amours at\r\nonce distinguished and delicate. He rose and resumed his journey,\r\nthinking of Forestier. What luck the fellow had!\r\n\r\nHe reached the door at the moment his friend was coming out of it. \"You\r\nhere at this time of day. What do you want of me?\"\r\n\r\nDuroy, taken aback at meeting him thus, just as he was starting off,\r\nstammered: \"You see, you see, I can't manage to write my article; you\r\nknow the article Monsieur Walter asked me to write on Algeria. It is\r\nnot very surprising, considering that I have never written anything.\r\nPractice is needed for that, as for everything else. I shall get used to\r\nit very quickly, I am sure, but I do not know how to set about\r\nbeginning. I have plenty of ideas, but I cannot manage to express them.\"\r\n\r\nHe stopped, hesitatingly, and Forestier smiled somewhat slyly, saying:\r\n\"I know what it is.\"\r\n\r\nDuroy went on: \"Yes, it must happen to everyone at the beginning. Well,\r\nI came, I came to ask you for a lift. In ten minutes you can give me a\r\nstart, you can show me how to shape it. It will be a good lesson in\r\nstyle you will give me, and really without you I do not see how I can\r\nget on with it.\"\r\n\r\nForestier still smiled, and tapping his old comrade on the arm, said:\r\n\"Go in and see my wife; she will settle your business quite as well as I\r\ncould. I have trained her for that kind of work. I, myself, have not\r\ntime this morning, or I would willingly have done it for you.\"\r\n\r\nDuroy suddenly abashed, hesitated, feeling afraid.\r\n\r\n\"But I cannot call on her at this time of the day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes; she is up. You will find her in my study arranging some notes\r\nfor me.\"\r\n\r\nDuroy refused to go upstairs, saying: \"No, I can't think of such a\r\nthing.\"\r\n\r\nForestier took him by the shoulders, twisted him round on his heels, and\r\npushing him towards the staircase, said: \"Go along, you great donkey,\r\nwhen I tell you to. You are not going to oblige me to go up these\r\nflights of stairs again to introduce you and explain the fix you are\r\nin.\"\r\n\r\nThen Duroy made up his mind. \"Thanks, then, I will go up,\" he said. \"I\r\nshall tell her that you forced me, positively forced me to come and see\r\nher.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right. She won't scratch your eyes out. Above all, do not forget\r\nour appointment for three o'clock.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! don't be afraid about that.\"\r\n\r\nForestier hastened off, and Duroy began to ascend the stairs slowly,\r\nstep by step, thinking over what he should say, and feeling uneasy as to\r\nhis probable reception.\r\n\r\nThe man servant, wearing a blue apron, and holding a broom in his hand,\r\nopened the door to him.\r\n\r\n\"Master is not at home,\" he said, without waiting to be spoken to.\r\n\r\nDuroy persisted.\r\n\r\n\"Ask Madame Forestier,\" said he, \"whether she will receive me, and tell\r\nher that I have come from her husband, whom I met in the street.\"\r\n\r\nThen he waited while the man went away, returned, and opening the door\r\non the right, said: \"Madame will see you, sir.\"\r\n\r\nShe was seated in an office armchair in a small room, the walls of which\r\nwere wholly hidden by books carefully ranged on shelves of black wood.\r\nThe bindings, of various tints, red, yellow, green, violet, and blue,\r\ngave some color and liveliness to those monotonous lines of volumes.\r\n\r\nShe turned round, still smiling. She was wrapped in a white dressing\r\ngown, trimmed with lace, and as she held out her hand, displayed her\r\nbare arm in its wide sleeve.\r\n\r\n\"Already?\" said she, and then added: \"That is not meant for a reproach,\r\nbut a simple question.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, madame, I did not want to come up, but your husband, whom I met at\r\nthe bottom of the house, obliged me to. I am so confused that I dare not\r\ntell you what brings me.\"\r\n\r\nShe pointed to a chair, saying: \"Sit down and tell me about it.\"\r\n\r\nShe was twirling a goose-quill between her fingers, and in front of her\r\nwas a half-written page, interrupted by the young fellow's arrival. She\r\nseemed quite at home at this work table, as much at her ease as if in\r\nher drawing-room, engaged on everyday tasks. A faint perfume emanated\r\nfrom her dressing gown, the fresh perfume of a recent toilet. Duroy\r\nsought to divine, fancied he could trace, the outline of her plump,\r\nyouthful figure through the soft material enveloping it.\r\n\r\nShe went on, as he did not reply: \"Well, come tell me what is it.\"\r\n\r\nHe murmured, hesitatingly: \"Well, you see--but I really dare not--I was\r\nworking last night very late and quite early this morning on the article\r\nupon Algeria, upon which Monsieur Walter asked me to write, and I could\r\nnot get on with it--I tore up all my attempts. I am not accustomed to\r\nthis kind of work, and I came to ask Forestier to help me this once--\"\r\n\r\nShe interrupted him, laughing heartily. \"And he told you to come and see\r\nme? That is a nice thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, madame. He said that you will get me out of my difficulty better\r\nthan himself, but I did not dare, I did not wish to--you understand.\"\r\n\r\nShe rose, saying: \"It will be delightful to work in collaboration with\r\nyou like that. I am charmed at the notion. Come, sit down in my place,\r\nfor they know my hand-writing at the office. And we will knock you off\r\nan article; oh, but a good one.\"\r\n\r\nHe sat down, took a pen, spread a sheet of paper before him, and waited.\r\n\r\nMadame Forestier, standing by, watched him make these preparations, then\r\ntook a cigarette from the mantel-shelf, and lit it.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot work without smoking,\" said she. \"Come, what are you going to\r\nsay?\"\r\n\r\nHe lifted his head towards her with astonishment.\r\n\r\n\"But that is just what I don't know, since it is that I came to see you\r\nabout.\"\r\n\r\nShe replied: \"Oh, I will put it in order for you. I will make the sauce,\r\nbut then I want the materials of the dish.\"\r\n\r\nHe remained embarrassed before her. At length he said, hesitatingly: \"I\r\nshould like to relate my journey, then, from the beginning.\"\r\n\r\nThen she sat down before him on the other side of the table, and looking\r\nhim in the eyes:\r\n\r\n\"Well, tell it me first; for myself alone, you understand, slowly and\r\nwithout forgetting anything, and I will select what is to be used of\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nBut as he did not know where to commence, she began to question him as a\r\npriest would have done in the confessional, putting precise questions\r\nwhich recalled to him forgotten details, people encountered and faces\r\nmerely caught sight of.\r\n\r\nWhen she had made him speak thus for about a quarter of an hour, she\r\nsuddenly interrupted him with: \"Now we will begin. In the first place,\r\nwe will imagine that you are narrating your impressions to a friend,\r\nwhich will allow you to write a lot of tom-foolery, to make remarks of\r\nall kinds, to be natural and funny if we can. Begin:\r\n\r\n\"'My Dear Henry,--You want to know what Algeria is like, and you shall.\r\nI will send you, having nothing else to do in a little cabin of dried\r\nmud which serves me as a habitation, a kind of journal of my life, day\r\nby day, and hour by hour. It will be a little lively at times, more is\r\nthe pity, but you are not obliged to show it to your lady friends.'\"\r\n\r\nShe paused to re-light her cigarette, which had gone out, and the faint\r\ncreaking of the quill on the paper stopped, too.\r\n\r\n\"Let us continue,\" said she.\r\n\r\n\"Algeria is a great French country on the frontiers of the great unknown\r\ncountries called the Desert, the Sahara, central Africa, etc., etc.\r\n\r\n\"Algiers is the door, the pretty white door of this strange continent.\r\n\r\n\"But it is first necessary to get to it, which is not a rosy job for\r\neveryone. I am, you know, an excellent horseman, since I break in the\r\ncolonel's horses; but a man may be a very good rider and a very bad\r\nsailor. That is my case.\r\n\r\n\"You remember Surgeon-Major Simbretras, whom we used to call Old\r\nIpecacuanha, and how, when we thought ourselves ripe for a twenty-four\r\nhours' stay in the infirmary, that blessed sojourning place, we used to\r\ngo up before him.\r\n\r\n\"How he used to sit in his chair, with his fat legs in his red trousers,\r\nwide apart, his hands on his knees, and his elbows stuck, rolling his\r\ngreat eyes and gnawing his white moustache.\r\n\r\n\"You remember his favorite mode of treatment: 'This man's stomach is\r\nout of order. Give him a dose of emetic number three, according to my\r\nprescription, and then twelve hours off duty, and he will be all right.'\r\n\r\n\"It was a sovereign remedy that emetic--sovereign and irresistible. One\r\nswallowed it because one had to. Then when one had undergone the effects\r\nof Old Ipecacuanha's prescription, one enjoyed twelve well-earned hours'\r\nrest.\r\n\r\n\"Well, my dear fellow, to reach Africa, it is necessary to undergo for\r\nforty hours the effects of another kind of irresistible emetic,\r\naccording to the prescription of the Compagnie Transatlantique.\"\r\n\r\nShe rubbed her hands, delighted with the idea.\r\n\r\nShe got up and walked about, after having lit another cigarette, and\r\ndictated as she puffed out little whiffs of smoke, which, issuing at\r\nfirst through a little round hole in the midst of her compressed lips,\r\nslowly evaporated, leaving in the air faint gray lines, a kind of\r\ntransparent mist, like a spider's web. Sometimes with her open hand she\r\nwould brush these light traces aside; at others she would cut them\r\nasunder with her forefinger, and then watch with serious attention the\r\ntwo halves of the almost impenetrable vapor slowly disappear.\r\n\r\nDuroy, with his eyes, followed all her gestures, her attitudes, the\r\nmovements of her form and features--busied with this vague pastime which\r\ndid not preoccupy her thoughts.\r\n\r\nShe now imagined the incidents of the journey, sketched traveling\r\ncompanions invented by herself, and a love affair with the wife of a\r\ncaptain of infantry on her way to join her husband.\r\n\r\nThen, sitting down again, she questioned Duroy on the topography of\r\nAlgeria, of which she was absolutely ignorant. In ten minutes she knew\r\nas much about it as he did, and she dictated a little chapter of\r\npolitical and colonial geography to coach the reader up in such matters\r\nand prepare him to understand the serious questions which were to be\r\nbrought forward in the following articles. She continued by a trip into\r\nthe provinces of Oran, a fantastic trip, in which it was, above all, a\r\nquestion of women, Moorish, Jewish, and Spanish.\r\n\r\n\"That is what interests most,\" she said.\r\n\r\nShe wound up by a sojourn at Saida, at the foot of the great tablelands;\r\nand by a pretty little intrigue between the sub-officer, George Duroy,\r\nand a Spanish work-girl employed at the _alfa_ factory at Ain el Hadjar.\r\nShe described their rendezvous at night amidst the bare, stony hills,\r\nwith jackals, hyenas, and Arab dogs yelling, barking and howling among\r\nthe rocks.\r\n\r\nAnd she gleefully uttered the words: \"To be continued.\" Then rising, she\r\nadded: \"That is how one writes an article, my dear sir. Sign it, if you\r\nplease.\"\r\n\r\nHe hesitated.\r\n\r\n\"But sign it, I tell you.\"\r\n\r\nThen he began to laugh, and wrote at the bottom of the page, \"George\r\nDuroy.\"\r\n\r\nShe went on smoking as she walked up and down; and he still kept looking\r\nat her, unable to find anything to say to thank her, happy to be with\r\nher, filled with gratitude, and with the sensual pleasure of this\r\nnew-born intimacy. It seemed to him that everything surrounding him was\r\npart of her, everything down to the walls covered with books. The\r\nchairs, the furniture, the air in which the perfume of tobacco was\r\nfloating, had something special, nice, sweet, and charming, which\r\nemanated from her.\r\n\r\nSuddenly she asked: \"What do you think of my friend, Madame de Marelle?\"\r\n\r\nHe was surprised, and answered: \"I think--I think--her very charming.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it not so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, certainly.\"\r\n\r\nHe longed to add: \"But not so much as yourself,\" but dared not.\r\n\r\nShe resumed: \"And if you only knew how funny, original, and intelligent\r\nshe is. She is a Bohemian--a true Bohemian. That is why her husband\r\nscarcely cares for her. He only sees her defects, and does not\r\nappreciate her good qualities.\"\r\n\r\nDuroy felt stupefied at learning that Madame de Marelle was married, and\r\nyet it was only natural that she should be.\r\n\r\nHe said: \"Oh, she is married, then! And what is her husband?\"\r\n\r\nMadame Forestier gently shrugged her shoulders, and raised her eyebrows,\r\nwith a gesture of incomprehensible meaning.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! he is an inspector on the Northern Railway. He spends eight days\r\nout of the month in Paris. What his wife calls 'obligatory service,' or\r\n'weekly duty,' or 'holy week.' When you know her better you will see how\r\nnice and bright she is. Go and call on her one of these days.\"\r\n\r\nDuroy no longer thought of leaving. It seemed to him that he was going\r\nto stop for ever; that he was at home.\r\n\r\nBut the door opened noiselessly, and a tall gentleman entered without\r\nbeing announced. He stopped short on seeing a stranger. Madame Forestier\r\nseemed troubled for a moment; then she said in natural tones, though a\r\nslight rosy flush had risen to her cheeks:\r\n\r\n\"Come in, my dear sir. I must introduce one of Charles' old friends,\r\nMonsieur George Duroy, a future journalist.\" Then in another tone, she\r\nadded: \"Our best and most intimate friend, the Count de Vaudrec.\"\r\n\r\nThe two men bowed, looking each other in the eyes, and Duroy at once\r\ntook his leave.\r\n\r\nThere was no attempt to detain him. He stammered a few thanks, grasped\r\nthe outstretched hand of Madame Forestier, bowed again to the new-comer,\r\nwho preserved the cold, grave air of a man of position, and went out\r\nquite disturbed, as if he had made a fool of himself.\r\n\r\nOn finding himself once more in the street, he felt sad and uneasy,\r\nhaunted by the vague idea of some hidden vexation. He walked on, asking\r\nhimself whence came this sudden melancholy. He could not tell, but the\r\nstern face of the Count de Vaudrec, already somewhat aged, with gray\r\nhair, and the calmly insolent look of a very wealthy man, constantly\r\nrecurred to his recollection. He noted that the arrival of this unknown,\r\nbreaking off a charming _tete-a-tete_, had produced in him that chilly,\r\ndespairing sensation that a word overheard, a trifle noticed, the least\r\nthing suffices sometimes to bring about. It seemed to him, too, that\r\nthis man, without his being able to guess why, had been displeased at\r\nfinding him there.\r\n\r\nHe had nothing more to do till three o'clock, and it was not yet noon.\r\nHe had still six francs fifty centimes in his pocket, and he went and\r\nlunched at a Bouillon Duval. Then he prowled about the boulevard, and\r\nas three o'clock struck, ascended the staircase, in itself an\r\nadvertisement, of the _Vie Francaise_.\r\n\r\nThe messengers-in-waiting were seated with folded arms on a bench, while\r\nat a kind of desk a doorkeeper was sorting the correspondence that had\r\njust arrived. The entire get-up of the place, intended to impress\r\nvisitors, was perfect. Everyone had the appearance, bearing, dignity,\r\nand smartness suitable to the ante-room of a large newspaper.\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur Walter, if you please?\" inquired Duroy.\r\n\r\n\"The manager is engaged, sir,\" replied the doorkeeper. \"Will you take a\r\nseat, sir?\" and he indicated the waiting-room, already full of people.\r\n\r\nThere were men grave, important-looking, and decorated; and men without\r\nvisible linen, whose frock-coats, buttoned up to the chin, bore upon the\r\nbreast stains recalling the outlines of continents and seas on\r\ngeographical maps. There were three women among them. One of them was\r\npretty, smiling, and decked out, and had the air of a gay woman; her\r\nneighbor, with a wrinkled, tragic countenance, decked out also, but in\r\nmore severe fashion, had about her something worn and artificial which\r\nold actresses generally have; a kind of false youth, like a scent of\r\nstale love. The third woman, in mourning, sat in a corner, with the air\r\nof a desolate widow. Duroy thought that she had come to ask for charity.\r\n\r\nHowever, no one was ushered into the room beyond, and more than twenty\r\nminutes had elapsed.\r\n\r\nDuroy was seized with an idea, and going back to the doorkeeper, said:\r\n\"Monsieur Walter made an appointment for me to call on him here at three\r\no'clock. At all events, see whether my friend, Monsieur Forestier, is\r\nhere.\"\r\n\r\nHe was at once ushered along a lengthy passage, which brought him to a\r\nlarge room where four gentlemen were writing at a large green-covered\r\ntable.\r\n\r\nForestier standing before the fireplace was smoking a cigarette and\r\nplaying at cup and ball. He was very clever at this, and kept spiking\r\nthe huge ball of yellow boxwood on the wooden point. He was counting\r\n\"Twenty-two, twenty-three, twenty-four, twenty-five.\"\r\n\r\n\"Twenty-six,\" said Duroy.\r\n\r\nHis friend raised his eyes without interrupting the regular movement of\r\nhis arm, saying: \"Oh! here you are, then. Yesterday I landed the ball\r\nfifty-seven times right off. There is only Saint-Potin who can beat me\r\nat it among those here. Have you seen the governor? There is nothing\r\nfunnier than to see that old tubby Norbert playing at cup and ball. He\r\nopens his mouth as if he was going to swallow the ball every time.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the others turned round towards him, saying: \"I say, Forestier, I\r\nknow of one for sale, a beauty in West Indian wood; it is said to have\r\nbelonged to the Queen of Spain. They want sixty francs for it. Not\r\ndear.\"\r\n\r\nForestier asked: \"Where does it hang out?\"\r\n\r\nAnd as he had missed his thirty-seventh shot, he opened a cupboard in\r\nwhich Duroy saw a score of magnificent cups and balls, arranged and\r\nnumbered like a collection of art objects. Then having put back the one\r\nhe had been using in its usual place, he repeated: \"Where does this gem\r\nhang out?\"\r\n\r\nThe journalist replied: \"At a box-office keeper's of the Vaudeville. I\r\nwill bring it you to-morrow, if you like.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right. If it is really a good one I will take it; one can never\r\nhave too many.\" Then turning to Duroy he added: \"Come with me. I will\r\ntake you in to see the governor; otherwise you might be getting mouldy\r\nhere till seven in the evening.\"\r\n\r\nThey re-crossed the waiting-room, in which the same people were waiting\r\nin the same order. As soon as Forestier appeared the young woman and the\r\nold actress, rising quickly, came up to him. He took them aside one\r\nafter the other into the bay of the window, and although they took care\r\nto talk in low tones, Duroy noticed that they were on familiar terms.\r\n\r\nThen, having passed through two padded doors, they entered the manager's\r\nroom. The conference which had been going on for an hour or so was\r\nnothing more than a game at ecarte with some of the gentlemen with the\r\nflat brimmed hats whom Duroy had noticed the night before.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Walter dealt and played with concentrated attention and crafty\r\nmovements, while his adversary threw down, picked up, and handled the\r\nlight bits of colored pasteboard with the swiftness, skill, and grace of\r\na practiced player. Norbert de Varenne, seated in the managerial\r\narmchair, was writing an article. Jacques Rival, stretched at full\r\nlength on a couch, was smoking a cigar with his eyes closed.\r\n\r\nThe room smelled close, with that blended odor of leather-covered\r\nfurniture, stale tobacco, and printing-ink peculiar to editors' rooms\r\nand familiar to all journalists. Upon the black wood table, inlaid with\r\nbrass, lay an incredible pile of papers, letters, cards, newspapers,\r\nmagazines, bills, and printed matter of every description.\r\n\r\nForestier shook hands with the punters standing behind the card players,\r\nand without saying a word watched the progress of the game; then, as\r\nsoon as Daddy Walter had won, he said: \"Here is my friend, Duroy.\"\r\n\r\nThe manager glanced sharply at the young fellow over the glasses of his\r\nspectacles, and said:\r\n\r\n\"Have you brought my article? It would go very well to-day with the\r\nMorel debate.\"\r\n\r\nDuroy took the sheets of paper folded in four from his pocket, saying:\r\n\"Here it is sir.\"\r\n\r\nThe manager seemed pleased, and remarked, with a smile: \"Very good, very\r\ngood. You are a man of your word. You must look through this for me,\r\nForestier.\"\r\n\r\nBut Forestier hastened to reply: \"It is not worth while, Monsieur\r\nWalter. I did it with him to give him a lesson in the tricks of the\r\ntrade. It is very well done.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the manager, who was gathering up the cards dealt by a tall, thin\r\ngentleman, a deputy belonging to the Left Center, remarked with\r\nindifference: \"All right, then.\"\r\n\r\nForestier, however, did not let him begin the new game, but stooping,\r\nmurmured in his ear: \"You know you promised me to take on Duroy to\r\nreplace Marambot. Shall I engage him on the same terms?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, certainly.\"\r\n\r\nTaking his friend's arm, the journalist led him away, while Monsieur\r\nWalter resumed the game.\r\n\r\nNorbert de Varenne had not lifted his head; he did not appear to have\r\nseen or recognized Duroy. Jacques Rival, on the contrary, had taken his\r\nhand with the marked and demonstrative energy of a comrade who may be\r\nreckoned upon in the case of any little difficulty.\r\n\r\nThey passed through the waiting-room again, and as everyone looked at\r\nthem, Forestier said to the youngest of the women, in a tone loud enough\r\nto be heard by the rest: \"The manager will see you directly. He is just\r\nnow engaged with two members of the Budget Committee.\"\r\n\r\nThen he passed swiftly on, with an air of hurry and importance, as\r\nthough about to draft at once an article of the utmost weight.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they were back in the reporters' room Forestier at once took\r\nup his cup and ball, and as he began to play with it again, said to\r\nDuroy, breaking his sentences in order to count: \"You will come here\r\nevery day at three o'clock, and I will tell you the places you are to go\r\nto, either during the day or in the evening, or the next morning--one--I\r\nwill give you, first of all, a letter of introduction to the head of the\r\nFirst Department of the Prefecture of Police--two--who will put you in\r\ncommunication with one of his clerks. You will settle with him about all\r\nthe important information--three--from the Prefecture, official and\r\nquasi-official information, you know. In all matters of detail you will\r\napply to Saint-Potin, who is up in the work--four--You can see him\r\nby-and-by, or to-morrow. You must, above all, cultivate the knack of\r\ndragging information out of men I send you to see--five--and to get in\r\neverywhere, in spite of closed doors--six--You will have for this a\r\nsalary of two hundred francs a month, with two sous a line for the\r\nparagraphs you glean--seven--and two sous a line for all articles\r\nwritten by you to order on different subjects--eight.\"\r\n\r\nThen he gave himself up entirely to his occupation, and went on slowly\r\ncounting: \"Nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen.\" He missed the\r\nfourteenth, and swore, \"Damn that thirteen, it always brings me bad\r\nluck. I shall die on the thirteenth of some month, I am certain.\"\r\n\r\nOne of his colleagues who had finished his work also took a cup and ball\r\nfrom the cupboard. He was a little man, who looked like a boy, although\r\nhe was really five-and-thirty. Several other journalists having come in,\r\nwent one after the other and got out the toy belonging to each of them.\r\nSoon there were six standing side by side, with their backs to the wall,\r\nswinging into the air, with even and regular motion, the balls of red,\r\nyellow, and black, according to the wood they were made of. And a match\r\nhaving begun, the two who were still working got up to act as umpires.\r\nForestier won by eleven points. Then the little man, with the juvenile\r\naspect, who had lost, rang for the messenger, and gave the order, \"Nine\r\nbocks.\" And they began to play again pending the arrival of these\r\nrefreshments.\r\n\r\nDuroy drank a glass of beer with his new comrades, and then said to his\r\nfriend: \"What am I to do now?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have nothing for you to-day. You can go if you want to.\"\r\n\r\n\"And our--our--article, will it go in to-night?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but do not bother yourself about it; I will correct the proofs.\r\nWrite the continuation for to-morrow, and come here at three o'clock,\r\nthe same as to-day.\"\r\n\r\nDuroy having shaken hands with everyone, without even knowing their\r\nnames, went down the magnificent staircase with a light heart and high\r\nspirits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge Duroy slept badly, so excited was he by the wish to see his\r\narticle in print. He was up as soon as it was daylight, and was prowling\r\nabout the streets long before the hour at which the porters from the\r\nnewspaper offices run with their papers from kiosque to kiosque. He went\r\non to the Saint Lazare terminus, knowing that the _Vie Francaise_ would\r\nbe delivered there before it reached his own district. As he was still\r\ntoo early, he wandered up and down on the footpath.\r\n\r\nHe witnessed the arrival of the newspaper vendor who opened her glass\r\nshop, and then saw a man bearing on his head a pile of papers. He rushed\r\nforward. There were the _Figaro_, the _Gil Blas_, the _Gaulois_, the\r\n_Evenement_, and two or three morning journals, but the _Vie Francaise_\r\nwas not among them. Fear seized him. Suppose the \"Recollections of a\r\nChasseur d'Afrique\" had been kept over for the next day, or that by\r\nchance they had not at the last moment seemed suitable to Daddy Walter.\r\n\r\nTurning back to the kiosque, he saw that the paper was on sale without\r\nhis having seen it brought there. He darted forward, unfolded it, after\r\nhaving thrown down the three sous, and ran through the headings of the\r\narticles on the first page. Nothing. His heart began to beat, and he\r\nexperienced strong emotion on reading at the foot of a column in large\r\nletters, \"George Duroy.\" It was in; what happiness!\r\n\r\nHe began to walk along unconsciously, the paper in his hand and his hat\r\non one side of his head, with a longing to stop the passers-by in order\r\nto say to them: \"Buy this, buy this, there is an article by me in it.\"\r\nHe would have liked to have bellowed with all the power of his lungs,\r\nlike some vendors of papers at night on the boulevards, \"Read the _Vie\r\nFrancaise_; read George Duroy's article, 'Recollections of a Chasseur\r\nd'Afrique.'\" And suddenly he felt a wish to read this article himself,\r\nread it in a public place, a _cafe_, in sight of all. He looked about\r\nfor some establishment already filled with customers. He had to walk in\r\nsearch of one for some time. He sat down at last in front of a kind of\r\nwine shop, where several customers were already installed, and asked for\r\na glass of rum, as he would have asked for one of absinthe, without\r\nthinking of the time. Then he cried: \"Waiter, bring me the _Vie\r\nFrancaise_.\"\r\n\r\nA man in a white apron stepped up, saying: \"We have not got it, sir; we\r\nonly take in the _Rappel_, the _Siecle_, the _Lanierne_, and the _Petit\r\nParisien_.\"\r\n\r\n\"What a den!\" exclaimed Duroy, in a tone of anger and disgust. \"Here, go\r\nand buy it for me.\"\r\n\r\nThe waiter hastened to do so, and brought back the paper. Duroy began to\r\nread his article, and several times said aloud: \"Very good, very well\r\nput,\" to attract the attention of his neighbors, and inspire them with\r\nthe wish to know what there was in this sheet. Then, on going away, he\r\nleft it on the table. The master of the place, noticing this, called him\r\nback, saying: \"Sir, sir, you are forgetting your paper.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Duroy replied: \"I will leave it to you. I have finished with it.\r\nThere is a very interesting article in it this morning.\"\r\n\r\nHe did not indicate the article, but he noticed as he went away one of\r\nhis neighbors take the _Vie Francaise_ up from the table on which he had\r\nleft it.\r\n\r\nHe thought: \"What shall I do now?\" And he decided to go to his office,\r\ntake his month's salary, and tender his resignation. He felt a thrill of\r\nanticipatory pleasure at the thought of the faces that would be pulled\r\nup by the chief of his room and his colleagues. The notion of the\r\nbewilderment of the chief above all charmed him.\r\n\r\nHe walked slowly, so as not to get there too early, the cashier's office\r\nnot opening before ten o'clock.\r\n\r\nHis office was a large, gloomy room, in which gas had to be kept burning\r\nalmost all day long in winter. It looked into a narrow court-yard, with\r\nother offices on the further side of it. There were eight clerks there,\r\nbesides a sub-chief hidden behind a screen in one corner.\r\n\r\nDuroy first went to get the hundred and eighteen francs twenty-five\r\ncentimes enclosed in a yellow envelope, and placed in the drawer of the\r\nclerk entrusted with such payments, and then, with a conquering air,\r\nentered the large room in which he had already spent so many days.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he came in the sub-chief, Monsieur Potel, called out to him:\r\n\"Ah! it is you, Monsieur Duroy? The chief has already asked for you\r\nseveral times. You know that he will not allow anyone to plead illness\r\ntwo days running without a doctor's certificate.\"\r\n\r\nDuroy, who was standing in the middle of the room preparing his\r\nsensational effect, replied in a loud voice:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I don't care a damn whether he does or not.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a movement of stupefaction among the clerks, and Monsieur\r\nPotel's features showed affrightedly over the screen which shut him up\r\nas in a box. He barricaded himself behind it for fear of draughts, for\r\nhe was rheumatic, but had pierced a couple of holes through the paper to\r\nkeep an eye on his staff. A pin might have been heard to fall. At length\r\nthe sub-chief said, hesitatingly: \"You said?\"\r\n\r\n\"I said that I don't care a damn about it. I have only called to-day to\r\ntender my resignation. I am engaged on the staff of the _Vie Francaise_\r\nat five hundred francs a month, and extra pay for all I write. Indeed, I\r\nmade my _debut_ this morning.\"\r\n\r\nHe had promised himself to spin out his enjoyment, but had not been able\r\nto resist the temptation of letting it all out at once.\r\n\r\nThe effect, too, was overwhelming. No one stirred.\r\n\r\nDuroy went on: \"I will go and inform Monsieur Perthuis, and then come\r\nand wish you good-bye.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he went out in search of the chief, who exclaimed, on seeing him:\r\n\"Ah, here you are. You know that I won't have--\"\r\n\r\nHis late subordinate cut him short with: \"It's not worth while yelling\r\nlike that.\"\r\n\r\nMonsieur Perthuis, a stout man, as red as a turkey cock, was choked with\r\nbewilderment.\r\n\r\nDuroy continued: \"I have had enough of this crib. I made my _debut_ this\r\nmorning in journalism, where I am assured of a very good position. I\r\nhave the honor to bid you good-day.\" And he went out. He was avenged.\r\n\r\nAs he promised, he went and shook hands with his old colleagues, who\r\nscarcely dared to speak to him, for fear of compromising themselves, for\r\nthey had overheard his conversation with the chief, the door having\r\nremained open.\r\n\r\nHe found himself in the street again, with his salary in his pocket. He\r\nstood himself a substantial breakfast at a good but cheap restaurant he\r\nwas acquainted with, and having again purchased the _Vie Francaise_, and\r\nleft it on the table, went into several shops, where he bought some\r\ntrifles, solely for the sake of ordering them to be sent home, and\r\ngiving his name: \"George Duroy,\" with the addition, \"I am the editor of\r\nthe _Vie Francaise_.\"\r\n\r\nThen he gave the name of the street and the number, taking care to add:\r\n\"Leave it with the doorkeeper.\"\r\n\r\nAs he had still some time to spare he went into the shop of a\r\nlithographer, who executed visiting cards at a moment's notice before\r\nthe eyes of passers-by, and had a hundred, bearing his new occupation\r\nunder his name, printed off while he waited.\r\n\r\nThen he went to the office of the paper.\r\n\r\nForestier received him loftily, as one receives a subordinate. \"Ah! here\r\nyou are. Good. I have several things for you to attend to. Just wait ten\r\nminutes. I will just finish what I am about.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he went on with a letter he was writing.\r\n\r\nAt the other end of the large table a fat, bald little man, with a very\r\npale, puffy face, and a white and shining head, was writing, with his\r\nnose on the paper owing to extreme shortsightedness. Forestier said to\r\nhim: \"I say, Saint-Potin, when are you going to interview those\r\npeople?\"\r\n\r\n\"At four o'clock.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you take young Duroy here with you, and let him into the way of\r\ndoing it?\"\r\n\r\n\"All right.\"\r\n\r\nThen turning to his friend, Forestier added: \"Have you brought the\r\ncontinuation of the Algerian article? The opening this morning was very\r\nsuccessful.\"\r\n\r\nDuroy, taken aback, stammered: \"No. I thought I should have time this\r\nafternoon. I had heaps of things to do. I was not able.\"\r\n\r\nThe other shrugged his shoulders with a dissatisfied air. \"If you are\r\nnot more exact than that you will spoil your future. Daddy Walter was\r\nreckoning on your copy. I will tell him it will be ready to-morrow. If\r\nyou think you are to be paid for doing nothing you are mistaken.\"\r\n\r\nThen, after a short silence, he added: \"One must strike the iron while\r\nit is hot, or the deuce is in it.\"\r\n\r\nSaint-Potin rose, saying: \"I am ready.\"\r\n\r\nThen Forestier, leaning back in his chair, assumed a serious attitude in\r\norder to give his instructions, and turning to Duroy, said: \"This is\r\nwhat it is. Within the last two days the Chinese General, Li Theng Fao,\r\nhas arrived at the Hotel Continental, and the Rajah Taposahib Ramaderao\r\nPali at the Hotel Bristol. You will go and interview them.\" Turning to\r\nSaint-Potin, he continued: \"Don't forget the main points I told you of.\r\nAsk the General and the Rajah their opinion upon the action of England\r\nin the East, their ideas upon her system of colonization and domination,\r\nand their hopes respecting the intervention of Europe, and especially of\r\nFrance.\" He was silent for a moment, and then added in a theatrical\r\naside: \"It will be most interesting to our readers to learn at the same\r\ntime what is thought in China and India upon these matters which so\r\nforcibly occupy public attention at this moment.\" He continued, for the\r\nbenefit of Duroy: \"Watch how Saint-Potin sets to work; he is a capital\r\nreporter; and try to learn the trick of pumping a man in five minutes.\"\r\n\r\nThen he gravely resumed his writing, with the evident intention of\r\ndefining their relative positions, and putting his old comrade and\r\npresent colleague in his proper place.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they had crossed the threshold Saint-Potin began to laugh,\r\nand said to Duroy: \"There's a fluffer for you. He tried to fluff even\r\nus. One would really think he took us for his readers.\"\r\n\r\nThey reached the boulevard, and the reporter observed: \"Will you have a\r\ndrink?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly. It is awfully hot.\"\r\n\r\nThey turned into a _cafe_ and ordered cooling drinks. Saint-Potin began\r\nto talk. He talked about the paper and everyone connected with it with\r\nan abundance of astonishing details.\r\n\r\n\"The governor? A regular Jew? And you know, nothing can alter a Jew.\r\nWhat a breed!\" And he instanced some astounding traits of avariciousness\r\npeculiar to the children of Israel, economies of ten centimes, petty\r\nbargaining, shameful reductions asked for and obtained, all the ways of\r\na usurer and pawnbroker.\r\n\r\n\"And yet with all this, a good fellow who believes in nothing and does\r\neveryone. His paper, which is Governmental, Catholic, Liberal,\r\nRepublican, Orleanist, pay your money and take your choice, was only\r\nstarted to help him in his speculations on the Bourse, and bolster up\r\nhis other schemes. At that game he is very clever, and nets millions\r\nthrough companies without four sous of genuine capital.\"\r\n\r\nHe went on, addressing Duroy as \"My dear fellow.\"\r\n\r\n\"And he says things worthy of Balzac, the old shark. Fancy, the other\r\nday I was in his room with that old tub Norbert, and that Don Quixote\r\nRival, when Montelin, our business manager, came in with his morocco\r\nbill-case, that bill-case that everyone in Paris knows, under his arm.\r\nWalter raised his head and asked: 'What news?' Montelin answered simply:\r\n'I have just paid the sixteen thousand francs we owed the paper maker.'\r\nThe governor gave a jump, an astonishing jump. 'What do you mean?' said\r\nhe. 'I have just paid Monsieur Privas,' replied Montelin. 'But you are\r\nmad.' 'Why?' 'Why--why--why--' he took off his spectacles and wiped\r\nthem. Then he smiled with that queer smile that flits across his fat\r\ncheeks whenever he is going to say something deep or smart, and went on\r\nin a mocking and derisive tone, 'Why? Because we could have obtained a\r\nreduction of from four to five thousand francs.' Montelin replied, in\r\nastonishment: 'But, sir, all the accounts were correct, checked by me\r\nand passed by yourself.' Then the governor, quite serious again,\r\nobserved: 'What a fool you are. Don't you know, Monsieur Montelin, that\r\none should always let one's debts mount up, in order to offer a\r\ncomposition?'\"\r\n\r\nAnd Saint-Potin added, with a knowing shake of his head, \"Eh! isn't that\r\nworthy of Balzac?\"\r\n\r\nDuroy had not read Balzac, but he replied, \"By Jove! yes.\"\r\n\r\nThen the reporter spoke of Madame Walter, an old goose; of Norbert de\r\nVarenne, an old failure; of Rival, a copy of Fervacques. Next he came\r\nto Forestier. \"As to him, he has been lucky in marrying his wife, that\r\nis all.\"\r\n\r\nDuroy asked: \"What is his wife, really?\"\r\n\r\nSaint-Potin rubbed his hands. \"Oh! a deep one, a smart woman. She was\r\nthe mistress of an old rake named Vaudrec, the Count de Vaudrec, who\r\ngave her a dowry and married her off.\"\r\n\r\nDuroy suddenly felt a cold shiver run through him, a tingling of the\r\nnerves, a longing to smack this gabbler on the face. But he merely\r\ninterrupted him by asking:\r\n\r\n\"And your name is Saint-Potin?\"\r\n\r\nThe other replied, simply enough:\r\n\r\n\"No, my name is Thomas. It is in the office that they have nicknamed me\r\nSaint-Potin.\"\r\n\r\nDuroy, as he paid for the drinks, observed: \"But it seems to me that\r\ntime is getting on, and that we have two noble foreigners to call on.\"\r\n\r\nSaint-Potin began to laugh. \"You are still green. So you fancy I am\r\ngoing to ask the Chinese and the Hindoo what they think of England? As\r\nif I did not know better than themselves what they ought to think in\r\norder to please the readers of the _Vie Francaise_. I have already\r\ninterviewed five hundred of these Chinese, Persians, Hindoos, Chilians,\r\nJapanese, and others. They all reply the same, according to me. I have\r\nonly to take my article on the last comer and copy it word for word.\r\nWhat has to be changed, though, is their appearance, their name, their\r\ntitle, their age, and their suite. Oh! on that point it does not do to\r\nmake a mistake, for I should be snapped up sharp by the _Figaro_ or the\r\n_Gaulois_. But on these matters the hall porters at the Hotel Bristol\r\nand the Hotel Continental will put me right in five minutes. We will\r\nsmoke a cigar as we walk there. Five francs cab hire to charge to the\r\npaper. That is how one sets about it, my dear fellow, when one is\r\npractically inclined.\"\r\n\r\n\"It must be worth something decent to be a reporter under these\r\ncircumstances,\" said Duroy.\r\n\r\nThe journalist replied mysteriously: \"Yes, but nothing pays so well as\r\nparagraphs, on account of the veiled advertisements.\"\r\n\r\nThey had got up and were passing down the boulevards towards the\r\nMadeleine. Saint-Potin suddenly observed to his companion: \"You know if\r\nyou have anything else to do, I shall not need you in any way.\"\r\n\r\nDuroy shook hands and left him. The notion of the article to be written\r\nthat evening worried him, and he began to think. He stored his mind with\r\nideas, reflections, opinions, and anecdotes as he walked along, and went\r\nas far as the end of the Avenue des Champs Elysees, where only a few\r\nstrollers were to be seen, the heat having caused Paris to be evacuated.\r\n\r\nHaving dined at a wine shop near the Arc de Triomphe, he walked slowly\r\nhome along the outer boulevards and sat down at his table to work. But\r\nas soon as he had the sheet of blank paper before his eyes, all the\r\nmaterials that he had accumulated fled from his mind as though his brain\r\nhad evaporated. He tried to seize on fragments of his recollections and\r\nto retain them, but they escaped him as fast as he laid hold of them, or\r\nelse they rushed on him altogether pell-mell, and he did not know how to\r\nclothe and present them, nor which one to begin with.\r\n\r\nAfter an hour of attempts and five sheets of paper blackened by opening\r\nphrases that had no continuation, he said to himself: \"I am not yet\r\nwell enough up in the business. I must have another lesson.\" And all at\r\nonce the prospect of another morning's work with Madame Forestier, the\r\nhope of another long and intimate _tete-a-tete_ so cordial and so\r\npleasant, made him quiver with desire. He went to bed in a hurry, almost\r\nafraid now of setting to work again and succeeding all at once.\r\n\r\nHe did not get up the next day till somewhat late, putting off and\r\ntasting in advance the pleasure of this visit.\r\n\r\nIt was past ten when he rang his friend's bell.\r\n\r\nThe man-servant replied: \"Master is engaged at his work.\"\r\n\r\nDuroy had not thought that the husband might be at home. He insisted,\r\nhowever, saying: \"Tell him that I have called on a matter requiring\r\nimmediate attention.\"\r\n\r\nAfter waiting five minutes he was shown into the study in which he had\r\npassed such a pleasant morning. In the chair he had occupied Forestier\r\nwas now seated writing, in a dressing-gown and slippers and with a\r\nlittle Scotch bonnet on his head, while his wife in the same white gown\r\nleant against the mantelpiece and dictated, cigarette in mouth.\r\n\r\nDuroy, halting on the threshold, murmured: \"I really beg your pardon; I\r\nam afraid I am disturbing you.\"\r\n\r\nHis friend, turning his face towards him--an angry face, too--growled:\r\n\"What is it you want now? Be quick; we are pressed for time.\"\r\n\r\nThe intruder, taken back, stammered: \"It is nothing; I beg your\r\npardon.\"\r\n\r\nBut Forestier, growing angry, exclaimed: \"Come, hang it all, don't waste\r\ntime about it; you have not forced your way in just for the sake of\r\nwishing us good-morning, I suppose?\"\r\n\r\nThen Duroy, greatly perturbed, made up his mind. \"No--you see--the fact\r\nis--I can't quite manage my article--and you were--so--so kind last\r\ntime--that I hoped--that I ventured to come--\"\r\n\r\nForestier cut him short. \"You have a pretty cheek. So you think I am\r\ngoing to do your work, and that all you have to do is to call on the\r\ncashier at the end of the month to draw your screw? No, that is too\r\ngood.\"\r\n\r\nThe young woman went on smoking without saying a word, smiling with a\r\nvague smile, which seemed like an amiable mask, concealing the irony of\r\nher thoughts.\r\n\r\nDuroy, colored up, stammered: \"Excuse me--I fancied--I thought--\" then\r\nsuddenly, and in a clear voice, he went on: \"I beg your pardon a\r\nthousand times, Madame, while again thanking you most sincerely for the\r\ncharming article you produced for me yesterday.\" He bowed, remarked to\r\nCharles: \"I shall be at the office at three,\" and went out.\r\n\r\nHe walked home rapidly, grumbling: \"Well, I will do it all alone, and\r\nthey shall see--\"\r\n\r\nScarcely had he got in than, excited by anger, he began to write. He\r\ncontinued the adventure began by Madame Forestier, heaping up details of\r\ncatch-penny romance, surprising incidents, and inflated descriptions,\r\nwith the style of a schoolboy and the phraseology of the barrack-room.\r\nWithin an hour he had finished an article which was a chaos of nonsense,\r\nand took it with every assurance to the _Vie Francaise_.\r\n\r\nThe first person he met was Saint-Potin, who, grasping his hand with the\r\nenergy of an accomplice, said: \"You have read my interview with the\r\nChinese and the Hindoo? Isn't it funny? It has amused everyone. And I\r\ndid not even get a glimpse of them.\"\r\n\r\nDuroy, who had not read anything, at once took up the paper and ran his\r\neye over a long article headed: \"India and China,\" while the reporter\r\npointed out the most interesting passages.\r\n\r\nForestier came in puffing, in a hurry, with a busy air, saying:\r\n\r\n\"Good; I want both of you.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he mentioned a number of items of political information that would\r\nhave to be obtained that very afternoon.\r\n\r\nDuroy held out his article.\r\n\r\n\"Here is the continuation about Algeria.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good; hand it over; and I will give it to the governor.\"\r\n\r\nThat was all.\r\n\r\nSaint-Potin led away his new colleague, and when they were in the\r\npassage, he said to him: \"Have you seen the cashier?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why? To draw your money. You see you should always draw a month in\r\nadvance. One never knows what may happen.\"\r\n\r\n\"But--I ask for nothing better.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will introduce you to the cashier. He will make no difficulty about\r\nit. They pay up well here.\"\r\n\r\nDuroy went and drew his two hundred francs, with twenty-eight more for\r\nhis article of the day before, which, added to what remained of his\r\nsalary from the railway company, gave him three hundred and forty\r\nfrancs in his pocket. He had never owned such a sum, and thought himself\r\npossessed of wealth for an indefinite period.\r\n\r\nSaint-Potin then took him to have a gossip in the offices of four or\r\nfive rival papers, hoping that the news he was entrusted to obtain had\r\nalready been gleaned by others, and that he should be able to draw it\r\nout of them--thanks to the flow and artfulness of his conversation.\r\n\r\nWhen evening had come, Duroy, who had nothing more to do, thought of\r\ngoing again to the Folies Bergeres, and putting a bold face on, he went\r\nup to the box office.\r\n\r\n\"I am George Duroy, on the staff of the _Vie Francaise_. I came here the\r\nother day with Monsieur Forestier, who promised me to see about my being\r\nput on the free list; I do not know whether he has thought of it.\"\r\n\r\nThe list was referred to. His name was not entered.\r\n\r\nHowever, the box office-keeper, a very affable man, at once said: \"Pray,\r\ngo in all the same, sir, and write yourself to the manager, who, I am\r\nsure, will pay attention to your letter.\"\r\n\r\nHe went in and almost immediately met Rachel, the woman he had gone off\r\nwith the first evening. She came up to him, saying: \"Good evening,\r\nducky. Are you quite well?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, thanks--and you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am all right. Do you know, I have dreamed of you twice since last\r\ntime?\"\r\n\r\nDuroy smiled, feeling flattered. \"Ah! and what does that mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"It means that you pleased me, you old dear, and that we will begin\r\nagain whenever you please.\"\r\n\r\n\"To-day, if you like.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I am quite willing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good, but--\" He hesitated, a little ashamed of what he was going to do.\r\n\"The fact is that this time I have not a penny; I have just come from\r\nthe club, where I have dropped everything.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked him full in the eyes, scenting a lie with the instinct and\r\nhabit of a girl accustomed to the tricks and bargainings of men, and\r\nremarked: \"Bosh! That is not a nice sort of thing to try on me.\"\r\n\r\nHe smiled in an embarrassed way. \"If you will take ten francs, it is all\r\nI have left.\"\r\n\r\nShe murmured, with the disinterestedness of a courtesan gratifying a\r\nfancy: \"What you please, my lady; I only want you.\"\r\n\r\nAnd lifting her charming eyes towards the young man's moustache, she\r\ntook his arm and leant lovingly upon it.\r\n\r\n\"Let us go and have a grenadine first of all,\" she remarked. \"And then\r\nwe will take a stroll together. I should like to go to the opera like\r\nthis, with you, to show you off. And we will go home early, eh?\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe lay late at this girl's place. It was broad day when he left, and the\r\nnotion occurred to him to buy the _Vie Francaise_. He opened the paper\r\nwith feverish hand. His article was not there, and he stood on the\r\nfootpath, anxiously running his eye down the printed columns with the\r\nhope of at length finding what he was in search of. A weight suddenly\r\noppressed his heart, for after the fatigue of a night of love, this\r\nvexation came upon him with the weight of a disaster.\r\n\r\nHe reached home and went to sleep in his clothes on the bed.\r\n\r\nEntering the office some hours later, he went on to see Monsieur Walter.\r\n\r\n\"I was surprised at not seeing my second article on Algeria in the paper\r\nthis morning, sir,\" said he.\r\n\r\nThe manager raised his head, and replied in a dry tone: \"I gave it to\r\nyour friend Forestier, and asked him to read it through. He did not\r\nthink it up to the mark; you must rewrite it.\"\r\n\r\nDuroy, in a rage, went out without saying a word, and abruptly entering\r\nhis old comrade's room, said:\r\n\r\n\"Why didn't you let my article go in this morning?\"\r\n\r\nThe journalist was smoking a cigarette with his back almost on the seat\r\nof his armchair and his feet on the table, his heels soiling an article\r\nalready commenced. He said slowly, in a bored and distant voice, as\r\nthough speaking from the depths of a hole: \"The governor thought it\r\npoor, and told me to give it back to you to do over again. There it is.\"\r\nAnd he pointed out the slips flattened out under a paperweight.\r\n\r\nDuroy, abashed, could find nothing to say in reply, and as he was\r\nputting his prose into his pocket, Forestier went on: \"To-day you must\r\nfirst of all go to the Prefecture.\" And he proceeded to give a list of\r\nbusiness errands and items of news to be attended to.\r\n\r\nDuroy went off without having been able to find the cutting remark he\r\nwanted to. He brought back his article the next day. It was returned to\r\nhim again. Having rewritten it a third time, and finding it still\r\nrefused, he understood that he was trying to go ahead too fast, and\r\nthat Forestier's hand alone could help him on his way. He did not\r\ntherefore say anything more about the \"Recollections of a Chasseur\r\nd'Afrique,\" promising himself to be supple and cunning since it was\r\nneedful, and while awaiting something better to zealously discharge his\r\nduties as a reporter.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe learned to know the way behind the scenes in theatrical and political\r\nlife; the waiting-rooms of statesmen and the lobby of the Chamber of\r\nDeputies; the important countenances of permanent secretaries, and the\r\ngrim looks of sleepy ushers. He had continual relations with ministers,\r\ndoorkeepers, generals, police agents, princes, bullies, courtesans,\r\nambassadors, bishops, panders, adventurers, men of fashion,\r\ncard-sharpers, cab drivers, waiters, and many others, having become the\r\ninterested yet indifferent friend of all these; confounding them\r\ntogether in his estimation, measuring them with the same measure,\r\njudging them with the same eye, though having to see them every day at\r\nevery hour, without any transition, and to speak with them all on the\r\n\r\nsame business of his own. He compared himself to a man who had to drink\r\noff samples of every kind of wine one after the other, and who would\r\nsoon be unable to tell Chateau Margaux from Argenteuil.\r\n\r\nHe became in a short time a remarkable reporter, certain of his\r\ninformation, artful, swift, subtle, a real find for the paper, as was\r\nobserved by Daddy Walter, who knew what newspaper men were. However, as\r\nhe got only centimes a line in addition to his monthly screw of two\r\nhundred francs, and as life on the boulevards and in _cafes_ and\r\nrestaurants is costly, he never had a halfpenny, and was disgusted with\r\nhis poverty. There is some knack to be got hold of, he thought, seeing\r\nsome of his fellows with their pockets full of money without ever being\r\nable to understand what secret methods they could make use of to procure\r\nthis abundance. He enviously suspected unknown and suspicious\r\ntransactions, services rendered, a whole system of contraband accepted\r\nand agreed to. But it was necessary that he should penetrate the\r\nmystery, enter into the tacit partnership, make himself one with the\r\ncomrades who were sharing without him.\r\n\r\nAnd he often thought of an evening, as he watched the trains go by from\r\nhis window, of the steps he ought to take.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo months had gone by, September was at hand, and the rapid fortune\r\nwhich Duroy had hoped for seemed to him slow in coming. He was, above\r\nall, uneasy at the mediocrity of his position, and did not see by what\r\npath he could scale the heights on the summit of which one finds\r\nrespect, power, and money. He felt shut up in the mediocre calling of a\r\nreporter, so walled in as to be unable to get out of it. He was\r\nappreciated, but estimated in accordance with his position. Even\r\nForestier, to whom he rendered a thousand services, no longer invited\r\nhim to dinner, and treated him in every way as an inferior, though still\r\naccosting him as a friend.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time, it is true, Duroy, seizing an opportunity, got in a\r\nshort article, and having acquired through his paragraphs a mastery over\r\nhis pen, and a tact which was lacking to him when he wrote his second\r\narticle on Algeria, no longer ran any risk of having his descriptive\r\nefforts refused. But from this to writing leaders according to his\r\nfancy, or dealing with political questions with authority, there was as\r\ngreat a difference as driving in the Bois de Boulogne as a coachman, and\r\nas the owner of an equipage. That which humiliated him above everything\r\nwas to see the door of society closed to him, to have no equal relations\r\nwith it, not to be able to penetrate into the intimacy of its women,\r\nalthough several well-known actresses had occasionally received him with\r\nan interested familiarity.\r\n\r\nHe knew, moreover, from experience that all the sex, ladies or\r\nactresses, felt a singular attraction towards him, an instantaneous\r\nsympathy, and he experienced the impatience of a hobbled horse at not\r\nknowing those whom his future may depend on.\r\n\r\nHe had often thought of calling on Madame Forestier, but the\r\nrecollection of their last meeting checked and humiliated him; and\r\nbesides, he was awaiting an invitation to do so from her husband. Then\r\nthe recollection of Madame de Marelle occurred to him, and recalling\r\nthat she had asked him to come and see her, he called one afternoon when\r\nhe had nothing to do.\r\n\r\n\"I am always at home till three o'clock,\" she had said.\r\n\r\nHe rang at the bell of her residence, a fourth floor in the Rue de\r\nVerneuil, at half-past two.\r\n\r\nAt the sound of the bell a servant opened the door, an untidy girl, who\r\ntied her cap strings as she replied: \"Yes, Madame is at home, but I\r\ndon't know whether she is up.\"\r\n\r\nAnd she pushed open the drawing-room door, which was ajar. Duroy went\r\nin. The room was fairly large, scantily furnished and neglected looking.\r\nThe chairs, worn and old, were arranged along the walls, as placed by\r\nthe servant, for there was nothing to reveal the tasty care of the woman\r\nwho loves her home. Four indifferent pictures, representing a boat on a\r\nstream, a ship at sea, a mill on a plain, and a wood-cutter in a wood,\r\nhung in the center of the four walls by cords of unequal length, and all\r\nfour on one side. It could be divined that they had been dangling thus\r\naskew ever so long before indifferent eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuroy sat down immediately. He waited a long time. Then a door opened,\r\nand Madame de Marelle hastened in, wearing a Japanese morning gown of\r\nrose-colored silk embroidered with yellow landscapes, blue flowers, and\r\nwhite birds.\r\n\r\n\"Fancy! I was still in bed!\" she exclaimed. \"How good of you to come and\r\nsee me! I had made up my mind that you had forgotten me.\"\r\n\r\nShe held out both her hands with a delighted air, and Duroy, whom the\r\ncommonplace appearance of the room had put at his ease, kissed one, as\r\n\r\nhe had seen Norbert de Varenne do.\r\n\r\nShe begged him to sit down, and then scanning him from head to foot,\r\nsaid: \"How you have altered! You have improved in looks. Paris has done\r\nyou good. Come, tell me the news.\"\r\n\r\nAnd they began to gossip at once, as if they had been old acquaintances,\r\nfeeling an instantaneous familiarity spring up between them; feeling one\r\nof those mutual currents of confidence, intimacy, and affection, which,\r\nin five minutes, make two beings of the same breed and character good\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, Madame de Marelle exclaimed in astonishment: \"It is funny how\r\nI get on with you. It seems to me as though I had known you for ten\r\nyears. We shall become good friends, no doubt. Would you like it?\"\r\n\r\nHe answered: \"Certainly,\" with a smile which said still more.\r\n\r\nHe thought her very tempting in her soft and bright-hued gown, less\r\nrefined and delicate than the other in her white one, but more exciting\r\nand spicy. When he was beside Madame Forestier, with her continual and\r\ngracious smile which attracted and checked at the same time; which\r\nseemed to say: \"You please me,\" and also \"Take care,\" and of which the\r\nreal meaning was never clear, he felt above all the wish to lie down at\r\nher feet, or to kiss the lace bordering of her bodice, and slowly inhale\r\nthe warm and perfumed atmosphere that must issue from it. With Madame de\r\nMarelle he felt within him a more definite, a more brutal desire--a\r\ndesire that made his fingers quiver in presence of the rounded outlines\r\nof the light silk.\r\n\r\nShe went on talking, scattering in each phrase that ready wit of which\r\nshe had acquired the habit just as a workman acquires the knack needed\r\nto accomplish a task reputed difficult, and at which other folk are\r\nastonished. He listened, thinking: \"All this is worth remembering. A man\r\ncould write charming articles of Paris gossip by getting her to chat\r\nover the events of the day.\"\r\n\r\nSome one tapped softly, very softly, at the door by which she had\r\nentered, and she called out: \"You can come in, pet.\"\r\n\r\nHer little girl made her appearance, walked straight up to Duroy, and\r\nheld out her hand to him. The astonished mother murmured: \"But this is a\r\ncomplete conquest. I no longer recognize her.\"\r\n\r\nThe young fellow, having kissed the child, made her sit down beside him,\r\nand with a serious manner asked her pleasant questions as to what she\r\nhad been doing since they last met. She replied, in her little\r\nflute-like voice, with her grave and grown-up air.\r\n\r\nThe clock struck three, and the journalist arose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Come often,\" said Madame de Marelle, \"and we will chat as we have done\r\nto-day; it will always give me pleasure. But how is it one no longer\r\nsees you at the Forestiers?\" He replied: \"Oh! for no reason. I have been\r\nvery busy. I hope to meet you there again one of these days.\"\r\n\r\nHe went out, his heart full of hope, though without knowing why.\r\n\r\nHe did not speak to Forestier of this visit. But he retained the\r\nrecollection of it the following days, and more than the recollection--a\r\nsensation of the unreal yet persistent presence of this woman. It seemed\r\nto him that he had carried away something of her, the reflection of her\r\nform in his eyes, and the smack of her moral self in his heart. He\r\nremained under the haunted influence of her image, as it happens\r\nsometimes when we have passed pleasant hours with some one.\r\n\r\nHe paid a second visit a few days later.\r\n\r\nThe maid ushered him into the drawing-room, and Laurine at once\r\nappeared. She held out no longer her hand, but her forehead, and said:\r\n\"Mamma has told me to request you to wait for her. She will be a\r\nquarter-of-an-hour, because she is not dressed yet. I will keep you\r\ncompany.\"\r\n\r\nDuroy, who was amused by the ceremonious manners of the little girl,\r\nreplied: \"Certainly, Mademoiselle. I shall be delighted to pass a\r\nquarter-of-an-hour with you, but I warn you that for my part I am not at\r\nall serious, and that I play all day long, so I suggest a game at\r\ntouch.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl was astonished; then she smiled as a woman would have done at\r\nthis idea, which shocked her a little as well as astonished her, and\r\nmurmured: \"Rooms are not meant to be played in.\"\r\n\r\nHe said: \"It is all the same to me. I play everywhere. Come, catch me.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he began to go round the table, exciting her to pursue him, while\r\nshe came after him, smiling with a species of polite condescension, and\r\nsometimes extending her hand to touch him, but without ever giving way\r\nso far as to run. He stopped, stooped down, and when she drew near with\r\nher little hesitating steps, sprung up in the air like a\r\njack-in-the-box, and then bounded with a single stride to the other end\r\nof the dining-room. She thought it funny, ended by laughing, and\r\nbecoming aroused, began to trot after him, giving little gleeful yet\r\ntimid cries when she thought she had him. He shifted the chairs and used\r\nthem as obstacles, forcing her to go round and round one of them for a\r\nminute at a time, and then leaving that one to seize upon another.\r\nLaurine ran now, giving herself wholly up to the charm of this new game,\r\nand with flushed face, rushed forward with the bound of a delighted\r\nchild at each of the flights, the tricks, the feints of her companion.\r\nSuddenly, just as she thought she had got him, he seized her in his\r\narms, and lifting her to the ceiling, exclaimed: \"Touch.\"\r\n\r\nThe delighted girl wriggled her legs to escape, and laughed with all her\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nMadame de Marelle came in at that moment, and was amazed. \"What,\r\nLaurine, Laurine, playing! You are a sorcerer, sir.\"\r\n\r\nHe put down the little girl, kissed her mother's hand, and they sat down\r\nwith the child between them. They began to chat, but Laurine, usually so\r\nsilent, kept talking all the while, and had to be sent to her room. She\r\nobeyed without a word, but with tears in her eyes.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they were alone, Madame de Marelle lowered her voice. \"You do\r\nnot know, but I have a grand scheme, and I have thought of you. This is\r\nit. As I dine every week at the Forestiers, I return their hospitality\r\nfrom time to time at some restaurant. I do not like to entertain company\r\nat home, my household is not arranged for that, and besides, I do not\r\nunderstand anything about domestic affairs, anything about the kitchen,\r\nanything at all. I like to live anyhow. So I entertain them now and then\r\nat a restaurant, but it is not very lively when there are only three,\r\nand my own acquaintances scarcely go well with them. I tell you all this\r\nin order to explain a somewhat irregular invitation. You understand, do\r\nyou not, that I want you to make one of us on Saturday at the Cafe\r\nRiche, at half-past seven. You know the place?\"\r\n\r\nHe accepted with pleasure, and she went on: \"There will be only us four.\r\nThese little outings are very amusing to us women who are not accustomed\r\nto them.\"\r\n\r\nShe was wearing a dark brown dress, which showed off the lines of her\r\nwaist, her hips, her bosom, and her arm in a coquettishly provocative\r\nway. Duroy felt confusedly astonished at the lack of harmony between\r\nthis carefully refined elegance and her evident carelessness as regarded\r\nher dwelling. All that clothed her body, all that closely and directly\r\ntouched her flesh was fine and delicate, but that which surrounded her\r\ndid not matter to her.\r\n\r\nHe left her, retaining, as before, the sense of her continued presence\r\nin species of hallucination of the senses. And he awaited the day of the\r\ndinner with growing impatience.\r\n\r\nHaving hired, for the second time, a dress suit--his funds not yet\r\nallowing him to buy one--he arrived first at the rendezvous, a few\r\nminutes before the time. He was ushered up to the second story, and into\r\na small private dining-room hung with red and white, its single window\r\nopening into the boulevard. A square table, laid for four, displaying\r\nits white cloth, so shining that it seemed to be varnished, and the\r\nglasses and the silver glittered brightly in the light of the twelve\r\ncandles of two tall candelabra. Without was a broad patch of light\r\ngreen, due to the leaves of a tree lit up by the bright light from the\r\ndining-rooms.\r\n\r\nDuroy sat down in a low armchair, upholstered in red to match the\r\nhangings on the walls. The worn springs yielding beneath him caused him\r\nto feel as though sinking into a hole. He heard throughout the huge\r\nhouse a confused murmur, the murmur of a large restaurant, made up of\r\nthe clattering of glass and silver, the hurried steps of the waiters,\r\ndeadened by the carpets in the passages, and the opening of doors\r\nletting out the sound of voices from the numerous private rooms in which\r\npeople were dining. Forestier came in and shook hands with him, with a\r\ncordial familiarity which he never displayed at the offices of the _Vie\r\nFrancaise_.\r\n\r\n\"The ladies are coming together,\" said he; \"these little dinners are\r\nvery pleasant.\"\r\n\r\nThen he glanced at the table, turned a gas jet that was feebly burning\r\ncompletely off, closed one sash of the window on account of the draught,\r\nand chose a sheltered place for himself, with a remark: \"I must be\r\ncareful; I have been better for a month, and now I am queer again these\r\nlast few days. I must have caught cold on Tuesday, coming out of the\r\ntheater.\"\r\n\r\nThe door was opened, and, followed by a waiter, the two ladies appeared,\r\nveiled, muffled, reserved, with that charmingly mysterious bearing they\r\nassume in such places, where the surroundings are suspicious.\r\n\r\nAs Duroy bowed to Madame Forestier she scolded him for not having come\r\nto see her again; then she added with a smile, in the direction of her\r\nfriend: \"I know what it is; you prefer Madame de Marelle, you can find\r\ntime to visit her.\"\r\n\r\nThey sat down to table, and the waiter having handed the wine card to\r\nForestier, Madame de Marelle exclaimed: \"Give these gentlemen whatever\r\nthey like, but for us iced champagne, the best, sweet champagne,\r\nmind--nothing else.\" And the man having withdrawn, she added with an\r\nexcited laugh: \"I am going to get tipsy this evening; we will have a\r\nspree--a regular spree.\"\r\n\r\nForestier, who did not seem to have heard, said: \"Would you mind the\r\nwindow being closed? My chest has been rather queer the last few days.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, not at all.\"\r\n\r\nHe pushed too the sash left open, and returned to his place with a\r\nreassured and tranquil countenance. His wife said nothing. Seemingly\r\nlost in thought, and with her eyes lowered towards the table, she smiled\r\n\r\nat the glasses with that vague smile which seemed always to promise and\r\nnever to grant.\r\n\r\nThe Ostend oysters were brought in, tiny and plump like little ears\r\nenclosed in shells, and melting between the tongue and the palate like\r\nsalt bon-bons. Then, after the soup, was served a trout as rose-tinted\r\nas a young girl, and the guests began to talk.\r\n\r\nThey spoke at first of a current scandal; the story of a lady of\r\nposition, surprised by one of her husband's friends supping in a private\r\nroom with a foreign prince. Forestier laughed a great deal at the\r\nadventure; the two ladies declared that the indiscreet gossip was\r\nnothing less than a blackguard and a coward. Duroy was of their opinion,\r\nand loudly proclaimed that it is the duty of a man in these matters,\r\nwhether he be actor, confidant, or simple spectator, to be silent as the\r\ngrave. He added: \"How full life would be of pleasant things if we could\r\nreckon upon the absolute discretion of one another. That which often,\r\nalmost always, checks women is the fear of the secret being revealed.\r\nCome, is it not true?\" he continued. \"How many are there who would yield\r\nto a sudden desire, the caprice of an hour, a passing fancy, did they\r\nnot fear to pay for a short-lived and fleeting pleasure by an\r\nirremediable scandal and painful tears?\"\r\n\r\nHe spoke with catching conviction, as though pleading a cause, his own\r\ncause, as though he had said: \"It is not with me that one would have to\r\ndread such dangers. Try me and see.\"\r\n\r\nThey both looked at him approvingly, holding that he spoke rightly and\r\njustly, confessing by their friendly silence that their flexible\r\nmorality as Parisians would not have held out long before the certainty\r\nof secrecy. And Forestier, leaning back in his place on the divan, one\r\nleg bent under him, and his napkin thrust into his waistcoat, suddenly\r\nsaid with the satisfied laugh of a skeptic: \"The deuce! yes, they would\r\nall go in for it if they were certain of silence. Poor husbands!\"\r\n\r\nAnd they began to talk of love. Without admitting it to be eternal,\r\nDuroy understood it as lasting, creating a bond, a tender friendship, a\r\nconfidence. The union of the senses was only a seal to the union of\r\nhearts. But he was angry at the outrageous jealousies, melodramatic\r\nscenes, and unpleasantness which almost always accompany ruptures.\r\n\r\nWhen he ceased speaking, Madame de Marelle replied: \"Yes, it is the only\r\npleasant thing in life, and we often spoil it by preposterous\r\nunreasonableness.\"\r\n\r\nMadame Forestier, who was toying with her knife, added: \"Yes--yes--it is\r\npleasant to be loved.\"\r\n\r\nAnd she seemed to be carrying her dream further, to be thinking things\r\nthat she dared not give words to.\r\n\r\nAs the first _entree_ was slow in coming, they sipped from time to time\r\na mouthful of champagne, and nibbled bits of crust. And the idea of\r\nlove, entering into them, slowly intoxicated their souls, as the bright\r\nwine, rolling drop by drop down their throats, fired their blood and\r\nperturbed their minds.\r\n\r\nThe waiter brought in some lamb cutlets, delicate and tender, upon a\r\nthick bed of asparagus tips.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! this is good,\" exclaimed Forestier; and they ate slowly, savoring\r\nthe delicate meat and vegetables as smooth as cream.\r\n\r\nDuroy resumed: \"For my part, when I love a woman everything else in the\r\nworld disappears.\" He said this in a tone of conviction.\r\n\r\nMadame Forestier murmured, with her let-me-alone air:\r\n\r\n\"There is no happiness comparable to that of the first hand-clasp, when\r\nthe one asks, 'Do you love me?' and the other replies, 'Yes.'\"\r\n\r\nMadame de Marelle, who had just tossed a fresh glass of champagne off at\r\na draught, said gayly, as she put down her glass: \"For my part, I am not\r\nso Platonic.\"\r\n\r\nAnd all began to smile with kindling eyes at these words.\r\n\r\nForestier, stretched out in his seat on the divan, opened his arms,\r\nrested them on the cushions, and said in a serious tone: \"This frankness\r\ndoes you honor, and proves that you are a practical woman. But may one\r\nask you what is the opinion of Monsieur de Marelle?\"\r\n\r\nShe shrugged her shoulders slightly, with infinite and prolonged\r\ndisdain; and then in a decided tone remarked: \"Monsieur de Marelle has\r\nno opinions on this point. He only has--abstentions.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the conversation, descending from the elevated theories, concerning\r\nlove, strayed into the flowery garden of polished blackguardism. It was\r\nthe moment of clever double meanings; veils raised by words, as\r\npetticoats are lifted by the wind; tricks of language; clever disguised\r\naudacities; sentences which reveal nude images in covered phrases; which\r\ncause the vision of all that may not be said to flit rapidly before the\r\neye and the mind, and allow the well-bred people the enjoyment of a\r\nkind of subtle and mysterious love, a species of impure mental contact,\r\ndue to the simultaneous evocation of secret, shameful, and longed-for\r\npleasures. The roast, consisting of partridges flanked by quails, had\r\nbeen served; then a dish of green peas, and then a terrine of foie gras,\r\naccompanied by a curly-leaved salad, filling a salad bowl as though with\r\ngreen foam. They had partaken of all these things without tasting them,\r\nwithout knowing, solely taken up by what they were talking of, plunged\r\nas it were in a bath of love.\r\n\r\nThe two ladies were now going it strongly in their remarks. Madame de\r\nMarelle, with a native audacity which resembled a direct provocation,\r\nand Madame Forestier with a charming reserve, a modesty in her tone,\r\nvoice, smile, and bearing that underlined while seeming to soften the\r\nbold remarks falling from her lips. Forestier, leaning quite back on the\r\ncushions, laughed, drank and ate without leaving off, and sometimes\r\nthrew in a word so risque or so crude that the ladies, somewhat shocked\r\nby its appearance, and for appearance sake, put on a little air of\r\nembarrassment that lasted two or three seconds. When he had given vent\r\nto something a little too coarse, he added: \"You are going ahead nicely,\r\nmy children. If you go on like that you will end by making fools of\r\nyourselves.\"\r\n\r\nDessert came, and then coffee; and the liquors poured a yet warmer dose\r\nof commotion into the excited minds.\r\n\r\nAs she had announced on sitting down to table, Madame de Marelle was\r\nintoxicated, and acknowledged it in the lively and graceful rabble of a\r\nwoman emphasizing, in order to amuse her guests, a very real\r\ncommencement of drunkenness.\r\n\r\nMadame Forestier was silent now, perhaps out of prudence, and Duroy,\r\nfeeling himself too much excited not to be in danger of compromising\r\nhimself, maintained a prudent reserve.\r\n\r\nCigarettes were lit, and all at once Forestier began to cough. It was a\r\nterrible fit, that seemed to tear his chest, and with red face and\r\nforehead damp with perspiration, he choked behind his napkin. When the\r\nfit was over he growled angrily: \"These feeds are very bad for me; they\r\nare ridiculous.\" All his good humor had vanished before his terror of\r\nthe illness that haunted his thoughts. \"Let us go home,\" said he.\r\n\r\nMadame de Marelle rang for the waiter, and asked for the bill. It was\r\nbrought almost immediately. She tried to read it, but the figures danced\r\nbefore her eyes, and she passed it to Duroy, saying: \"Here, pay for me;\r\nI can't see, I am too tipsy.\"\r\n\r\nAnd at the same time she threw him her purse. The bill amounted to one\r\nhundred and thirty francs. Duroy checked it, and then handed over two\r\nnotes and received back the change, saying in a low tone: \"What shall I\r\ngive the waiter?\"\r\n\r\n\"What you like; I do not know.\"\r\n\r\nHe put five francs on the salver, and handed back the purse, saying:\r\n\"Shall I see you to your door?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly. I am incapable of finding my way home.\"\r\n\r\nThey shook hands with the Forestiers, and Duroy found himself alone with\r\nMadame de Marelle in a cab. He felt her close to him, so close, in this\r\ndark box, suddenly lit up for a moment by the lamps on the sidewalk. He\r\nfelt through his sleeve the warmth of her shoulder, and he could find\r\nnothing to say to her, absolutely nothing, his mind being paralyzed by\r\nthe imperative desire to seize her in his arms.\r\n\r\n\"If I dared to, what would she do?\" he thought. The recollection of all\r\nthe things uttered during dinner emboldened him, but the fear of scandal\r\nrestrained him at the same time.\r\n\r\nNor did she say anything either, but remained motionless in her corner.\r\nHe would have thought that she was asleep if he had not seen her eyes\r\nglitter every time that a ray of light entered the carriage.\r\n\r\n\"What was she thinking?\" He felt that he must not speak, that a word, a\r\nsingle word, breaking this silence would destroy his chance; yet courage\r\nfailed him, the courage needed for abrupt and brutal action. All at once\r\nhe felt her foot move. She had made a movement, a quick, nervous\r\nmovement of impatience, perhaps of appeal. This almost imperceptible\r\ngesture caused a thrill to run through him from head to foot, and he\r\nthrew himself upon her, seeking her mouth with his lips, her form with\r\nhis hands.\r\n\r\nBut the cab having shortly stopped before the house in which she\r\nresided, Duroy, surprised, had no time to seek passionate phrases to\r\nthank her, and express his grateful love. However, stunned by what had\r\ntaken place, she did not rise, she did not stir. Then he was afraid that\r\nthe driver might suspect something, and got out first to help her to\r\nalight.\r\n\r\nAt length she got out of the cab, staggering and without saying a word.\r\nHe rang the bell, and as the door opened, said, tremblingly: \"When shall\r\nI see you again?\"\r\n\r\nShe murmured so softly that he scarcely heard it: \"Come and lunch with\r\nme to-morrow.\" And she disappeared in the entry, pushed to the heavy\r\ndoor, which closed with a noise like that of a cannon. He gave the\r\ndriver five francs, and began to walk along with rapid and triumphant\r\nsteps, and heart overflowing with joy.\r\n\r\nHe had won at last--a married woman, a lady. How easy and unexpected it\r\nhad all been. He had fancied up till then that to assail and conquer one\r\nof these so greatly longed-for beings, infinite pains, interminable\r\nexpectations, a skillful siege carried on by means of gallant\r\nattentions, words of love, sighs, and gifts were needed. And, lo!\r\nsuddenly, at the faintest attack, the first whom he had encountered had\r\nyielded to him so quickly that he was stupefied at it.\r\n\r\n\"She was tipsy,\" he thought; \"to-morrow it will be another story. She\r\nwill meet me with tears.\" This notion disturbed him, but he added:\r\n\"Well, so much the worse. Now I have her, I mean to keep her.\"\r\n\r\nHe was somewhat agitated the next day as he ascended Madame de Marelle's\r\nstaircase. How would she receive him? And suppose she would not receive\r\nhim at all? Suppose she had forbidden them to admit him? Suppose she had\r\nsaid--but, no, she could not have said anything without letting the\r\nwhole truth be guessed. So he was master of the situation.\r\n\r\nThe little servant opened the door. She wore her usual expression. He\r\nfelt reassured, as if he had anticipated her displaying a troubled\r\ncountenance, and asked: \"Is your mistress quite well?\"\r\n\r\nShe replied: \"Oh! yes, sir, the same as usual,\" and showed him into the\r\ndrawing-room.\r\n\r\nHe went straight to the chimney-glass to ascertain the state of his hair\r\nand his toilet, and was arranging his necktie before it, when he saw in\r\nit the young woman watching him as she stood at the door leading from\r\nher room. He pretended not to have noticed her, and the pair looked at\r\none another for a few moments in the glass, observing and watching\r\nbefore finding themselves face to face. He turned round. She had not\r\nmoved, and seemed to be waiting. He darted forward, stammering: \"My\r\ndarling! my darling!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nShe opened her arms and fell upon his breast; then having lifted her\r\nhead towards him, their lips met in a long kiss.\r\n\r\nHe thought: \"It is easier than I should have imagined. It is all going\r\non very well.\"\r\n\r\nAnd their lips separating, he smiled without saying a word, while\r\nstriving to throw a world of love into his looks. She, too, smiled, with\r\nthat smile by which women show their desire, their consent, their wish\r\nto yield themselves, and murmured: \"We are alone. I have sent Laurine to\r\nlunch with one of her young friends.\"\r\n\r\nHe sighed as he kissed her. \"Thanks, I will worship you.\"\r\n\r\nThen she took his arm, as if he had been her husband, to go to the sofa,\r\non which they sat down side by side. He wanted to start a clever and\r\nattractive chat, but not being able to do so to his liking, stammered:\r\n\"Then you are not too angry with me?\"\r\n\r\nShe put her hand on his mouth, saying \"Be quiet.\"\r\n\r\nThey sat in silence, looking into one another's eyes, with burning\r\nfingers interlaced.\r\n\r\n\"How I did long for you!\" said he.\r\n\r\nShe repeated: \"Be quiet.\"\r\n\r\nThey heard the servant arranging the table in the adjoining\r\ndining-room, and he rose, saying: \"I must not remain so close to you. I\r\nshall lose my head.\"\r\n\r\nThe door opened, and the servant announced that lunch was ready. Duroy\r\ngravely offered his arm.\r\n\r\nThey lunched face to face, looking at one another and constantly\r\nsmiling, solely taken up by themselves, and enveloped in the sweet\r\nenchantment of a growing love. They ate, without knowing what. He felt a\r\nfoot, a little foot, straying under the table. He took it between his\r\nown and kept it there, squeezing it with all his might. The servant came\r\nand went, bringing and taking away the dishes with a careless air,\r\nwithout seeming to notice anything.\r\n\r\nWhen they had finished they returned to the drawing-room, and resumed\r\ntheir place on the sofa, side by side. Little by little he pressed up\r\nagainst her, striving to take her in his arms. But she calmly repulsed\r\nhim, saying: \"Take care; someone may come in.\"\r\n\r\nHe murmured: \"When can I see you quite alone, to tell you how I love\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\nShe leant over towards him and whispered: \"I will come and pay you a\r\nvisit one of these days.\"\r\n\r\nHe felt himself redden. \"You know--you know--my place is very small.\"\r\n\r\nShe smiled: \"That does not matter. It is you I shall call to see, and\r\nnot your rooms.\"\r\n\r\nThen he pressed her to know when she would come. She named a day in the\r\nlatter half of the week. He begged of her to advance the date in broken\r\nsentences, playing with and squeezing her hands, with glittering eyes,\r\nand flushed face, heated and torn by desire, that imperious desire which\r\nfollows _tete-a-tete_ repasts. She was amazed to see him implore her\r\nwith such ardor, and yielded a day from time to time. But he kept\r\nrepeating: \"To-morrow, only say to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nShe consented at length. \"Yes, to-morrow; at five o'clock.\"\r\n\r\nHe gave a long sigh of joy, and they then chatted almost quietly with an\r\nair of intimacy, as though they had known one another twenty years. The\r\nsound of the door bell made them start, and with a bound they separated\r\nto a distance. She murmured: \"It must be Laurine.\"\r\n\r\nThe child made her appearance, stopped short in amazement, and then ran\r\nto Duroy, clapping her hands with pleasure at seeing him, and\r\nexclaiming: \"Ah! pretty boy.\"\r\n\r\nMadame de Marelle began to laugh. \"What! Pretty boy! Laurine has\r\nbaptized you. It's a nice little nickname for you, and I will call you\r\nPretty-boy, too.\"\r\n\r\nHe had taken the little girl on his knee, and he had to play with her at\r\nall the games he had taught her. He rose to take his leave at twenty\r\nminutes to three to go to the office of the paper, and on the staircase,\r\nthrough the half-closed door, he still whispered: \"To-morrow, at five.\"\r\n\r\nShe answered \"Yes,\" with a smile, and disappeared.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he had got through his day's work, he speculated how he\r\nshould arrange his room to receive his mistress, and hide as far as\r\npossible the poverty of the place. He was struck by the idea of pinning\r\n\r\na lot of Japanese trifles on the walls, and he bought for five francs\r\nquite a collection of little fans and screens, with which he hid the\r\nmost obvious of the marks on the wall paper. He pasted on the window\r\npanes transparent pictures representing boats floating down rivers,\r\nflocks of birds flying across rosy skies, multi-colored ladies on\r\nbalconies, and processions of little black men over plains covered with\r\nsnow. His room, just big enough to sleep and sit down in, soon looked\r\nlike the inside of a Chinese lantern. He thought the effect\r\nsatisfactory, and passed the evening in pasting on the ceiling birds\r\nthat he had cut from the colored sheets remaining over. Then he went to\r\nbed, lulled by the whistle of the trains.\r\n\r\nHe went home early the next day, carrying a paper bag of cakes and a\r\nbottle of Madeira, purchased at the grocer's. He had to go out again to\r\nbuy two plates and two glasses, and arranged this collation on his\r\ndressing-table, the dirty wood of which was covered by a napkin, the jug\r\nand basin being hidden away beneath it.\r\n\r\nThen he waited.\r\n\r\nShe came at about a quarter-past five; and, attracted by the bright\r\ncolors of the pictures, exclaimed: \"Dear me, yours is a nice place. But\r\nthere are a lot of people about on the staircase.\"\r\n\r\nHe had clasped her in his arms, and was eagerly kissing the hair between\r\nher forehead and her bonnet through her veil.\r\n\r\nAn hour and a half later he escorted her back to the cab-stand in the\r\nRue de Rome. When she was in the carriage he murmured: \"Tuesday at the\r\nsame time?\"\r\n\r\nShe replied: \"Tuesday at the same time.\" And as it had grown dark, she\r\ndrew his head into the carriage and kissed him on the lips. Then the\r\ndriver, having whipped up his beast, she exclaimed: \"Good-bye,\r\nPretty-boy,\" and the old vehicle started at the weary trot of its old\r\nwhite horse.\r\n\r\nFor three weeks Duroy received Madame de Marelle in this way every two\r\nor three days, now in the evening and now in the morning. While he was\r\nexpecting her one afternoon, a loud uproar on the stairs drew him to the\r\ndoor. A child was crying. A man's angry voice shouted: \"What is that\r\nlittle devil howling about now?\" The yelling and exasperated voice of a\r\nwoman replied: \"It is that dirty hussy who comes to see the\r\npenny-a-liner upstairs; she has upset Nicholas on the landing. As if\r\ndabs like that, who pay no attention to children on the staircase,\r\nshould be allowed here.\"\r\n\r\nDuroy drew back, distracted, for he could hear the rapid rustling of\r\nskirts and a hurried step ascending from the story just beneath him.\r\nThere was soon a knock at the door, which he had reclosed. He opened it,\r\nand Madame de Marelle rushed into the room, terrified and breathless,\r\nstammering: \"Did you hear?\"\r\n\r\nHe pretended to know nothing. \"No; what?\"\r\n\r\n\"How they have insulted me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who? Who?\"\r\n\r\n\"The blackguards who live down below.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, surely not; what does it all mean, tell me?\"\r\n\r\nShe began to sob, without being able to utter a word. He had to take off\r\nher bonnet, undo her dress, lay her on the bed, moisten her forehead\r\nwith a wet towel. She was choking, and then when her emotion was\r\nsomewhat abated, all her wrathful indignation broke out. She wanted him\r\nto go down at once, to thrash them, to kill them.\r\n\r\nHe repeated: \"But they are only work-people, low creatures. Just\r\nremember that it would lead to a police court, that you might be\r\nrecognized, arrested, ruined. One cannot lower one's self to have\r\nanything to do with such people.\"\r\n\r\nShe passed on to another idea. \"What shall we do now? For my part, I\r\ncannot come here again.\"\r\n\r\nHe replied: \"It is very simple; I will move.\"\r\n\r\nShe murmured: \"Yes, but that will take some time.\" Then all at once she\r\nframed a plan, and reassured, added softly: \"No, listen, I know what to\r\ndo; let me act, do not trouble yourself about anything. I will send you\r\na telegram to-morrow morning.\"\r\n\r\nShe smiled now, delighted with her plan, which she would not reveal, and\r\nindulged in a thousand follies. She was very agitated, however, as she\r\nwent downstairs, leaning with all her weight on her lover's arm, her\r\nlegs trembled so beneath her. They did not meet anyone, though.\r\n\r\nAs he usually got up late, he was still in bed the next day, when, about\r\neleven o'clock, the telegraph messenger brought him the promised\r\ntelegram. He opened it and read:\r\n\r\n\"Meet me at five; 127, Rue de Constantinople. Rooms hired by Madame\r\nDuroy.--Clo.\"\r\n\r\nAt five o'clock to the minute he entered the doorkeeper's lodge of a\r\nlarge furnished house, and asked: \"It is here that Madame Duroy has\r\ntaken rooms, is it not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you show me to them, if you please.\"\r\n\r\nThe man, doubtless used to delicate situations in which prudence is\r\nnecessary, looked him straight in the eyes, and then, selecting one of\r\nthe long range of keys, said: \"You are Monsieur Duroy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, certainly.\"\r\n\r\nThe man opened the door of a small suite of rooms on the ground floor in\r\nfront of the lodge. The sitting-room, with a tolerably fresh wall-paper\r\nof floral design, and a carpet so thin that the boards of the floor\r\ncould be felt through it, had mahogany furniture, upholstered in green\r\nrep with a yellow pattern. The bedroom was so small that the bed\r\nthree-parts filled it. It occupied the further end, stretching from one\r\nwall to the other--the large bed of a furnished lodging-house, shrouded\r\nin heavy blue curtains also of rep, and covered with an eider-down quilt\r\nof red silk stained with suspicious-looking spots.\r\n\r\nDuroy, uneasy and displeased, thought: \"This place will cost, Lord knows\r\nhow much. I shall have to borrow again. It is idiotic what she has\r\ndone.\"\r\n\r\nThe door opened, and Clotilde came in like a whirlwind, with\r\noutstretched arms and rustling skirts. She was delighted. \"Isn't it\r\nnice, eh, isn't it nice? And on the ground floor, too; no stairs to go\r\nup. One could get in and out of the windows without the doorkeeper\r\nseeing one. How we will love one another here!\"\r\n\r\nHe kissed her coldly, not daring to put the question that rose to his\r\nlips. She had placed a large parcel on the little round table in the\r\nmiddle of the room. She opened it, and took out a cake of soap, a bottle\r\nof scent, a sponge, a box of hairpins, a buttonhook, and a small pair of\r\ncurling tongs to set right her fringe, which she got out of curl every\r\ntime. And she played at moving in, seeking a place for everything, and\r\nderived great amusement from it.\r\n\r\nShe kept on chattering as she opened the drawers. \"I must bring a little\r\nlinen, so as to be able to make a change if necessary. It will be very\r\nconvenient. If I get wet, for instance, while I am out, I can run in\r\nhere to dry myself. We shall each have one key, beside the one left with\r\nthe doorkeeper in case we forget it. I have taken the place for three\r\nmonths, in your name, of course, since I could not give my own.\"\r\n\r\nThen he said: \"You will let me know when the rent is to be paid.\"\r\n\r\nShe replied, simply: \"But it is paid, dear.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I owe it to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, my dear; it does not concern you at all; this is a little fancy\r\nof my own.\"\r\n\r\nHe seemed annoyed: \"Oh, no, indeed; I can't allow that.\"\r\n\r\nShe came to him in a supplicating way, and placing her hands on his\r\nshoulders, said: \"I beg of you, George; it will give me so much pleasure\r\nto feel that our little nest here is mine--all my own. You cannot be\r\nannoyed at that. How can you? I wanted to contribute that much towards\r\nour loves. Say you agree, Georgy; say you agree.\"\r\n\r\nShe implored him with looks, lips, the whole of her being. He held out,\r\nrefusing with an irritated air, and then he yielded, thinking that,\r\nafter all, it was fair. And when she had gone, he murmured, rubbing his\r\nhands, and without seeking in the depths of his heart whence the opinion\r\ncame on that occasion: \"She is very nice.\"\r\n\r\nHe received, a few days later, another telegram running thus: \"My\r\nhusband returns to-night, after six weeks' inspection, so we shall have\r\na week off. What a bore, darling.--Clo.\"\r\n\r\nDuroy felt astounded. He had really lost all idea of her being married.\r\nBut here was a man whose face he would have liked to see just once, in\r\norder to know him. He patiently awaited the husband's departure, but he\r\npassed two evenings at the Folies Bergere, which wound up with Rachel.\r\n\r\nThen one morning came a fresh telegram: \"To-day at five.--Clo.\"\r\n\r\nThey both arrived at the meeting-place before the time. She threw\r\nherself into his arms with an outburst of passion, and kissed him all\r\nover the face, and then said: \"If you like, when we have loved one\r\nanother a great deal, you shall take me to dinner somewhere. I have kept\r\n\r\nmyself disengaged.\"\r\n\r\nIt was at the beginning of the month, and although his salary was long\r\nsince drawn in advance, and he lived from day to day upon money gleaned\r\non every side, Duroy happened to be in funds, and was pleased at the\r\nopportunity of spending something upon her, so he replied: \"Yes,\r\ndarling, wherever you like.\"\r\n\r\nThey started off, therefore, at about seven, and gained the outer\r\nboulevards. She leaned closely against him, and whispered in his ear:\r\n\"If you only knew how pleased I am to walk out on your arm; how I love\r\nto feel you beside me.\"\r\n\r\nHe said: \"Would you like to go to Pere Lathuile's?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, it is too swell. I should like something funny, out of the way!\r\na restaurant that shopmen and work-girls go to. I adore dining at a\r\ncountry inn. Oh! if we only had been able to go into the country.\"\r\n\r\nAs he knew nothing of the kind in the neighborhood, they wandered along\r\nthe boulevard, and ended by going into a wine-shop where there was a\r\ndining-room. She had seen through the window two bareheaded girls\r\nseated at tables with two soldiers. Three cab-drivers were dining at the\r\nfurther end of the long and narrow room, and an individual impossible to\r\nclassify under any calling was smoking, stretched on a chair, with his\r\nlegs stuck out in front of him, his hands in the waist-band of his\r\ntrousers, and his head thrown back over the top bar. His jacket was a\r\nmuseum of stains, and in his swollen pockets could be noted the neck of\r\na bottle, a piece of bread, a parcel wrapped up in a newspaper, and a\r\ndangling piece of string. He had thick, tangled, curly hair, gray with\r\nscurf, and his cap was on the floor under his chair.\r\n\r\nThe entrance of Clotilde created a sensation, due to the elegance of her\r\ntoilet. The couples ceased whispering together, the three cab-drivers\r\nleft off arguing, and the man who was smoking, having taken his pipe\r\nfrom his mouth and spat in front of him, turned his head slightly to\r\nlook.\r\n\r\nMadame de Marelle murmured: \"It is very nice; we shall be very\r\ncomfortable here. Another time I will dress like a work-girl.\" And she\r\nsat down, without embarrassment or disgust, before the wooden table,\r\npolished by the fat of dishes, washed by spilt liquors, and cleaned by a\r\nwisp of the waiter's napkin. Duroy, somewhat ill at ease, and slightly\r\nashamed, sought a peg to hang his tall hat on. Not finding one, he put\r\nit on a chair.\r\n\r\nThey had a ragout, a slice of melon, and a salad. Clotilde repeated: \"I\r\ndelight in this. I have low tastes. I like this better than the Cafe\r\nAnglais.\" Then she added: \"If you want to give me complete enjoyment,\r\nyou will take me to a dancing place. I know a very funny one close by\r\ncalled the Reine Blanche.\"\r\n\r\nDuroy, surprised at this, asked: \"Whoever took you there?\"\r\n\r\nHe looked at her and saw her blush, somewhat disturbed, as though this\r\nsudden question had aroused within her some delicate recollections.\r\nAfter one of these feminine hesitations, so short that they can scarcely\r\nbe guessed, she replied: \"A friend of mine,\" and then, after a brief\r\nsilence, added, \"who is dead.\" And she cast down her eyes with a very\r\nnatural sadness.\r\n\r\nDuroy, for the first time, thought of all that he did not know as\r\nregarded the past life of this woman. Certainly she already had lovers,\r\nbut of what kind, in what class of society? A vague jealousy, a species\r\nof enmity awoke within him; an enmity against all that he did not know,\r\nall that had not belonged to him. He looked at her, irritated at the\r\nmystery wrapped up within that pretty, silent head, which was thinking,\r\nperhaps, at that very moment, of the other, the others, regretfully. How\r\nhe would have liked to have looked into her recollections--to have known\r\nall.\r\n\r\nShe repeated: \"Will you take me to the Reine Blanche? That will be a\r\nperfect treat.\"\r\n\r\nHe thought: \"What matters the past? I am very foolish to bother about\r\nit,\" and smilingly replied: \"Certainly, darling.\"\r\n\r\nWhen they were in the street she resumed, in that low and mysterious\r\ntone in which confidences are made: \"I dared not ask you this until now,\r\nbut you cannot imagine how I love these escapades in places ladies do\r\nnot go to. During the carnival I will dress up as a schoolboy. I make\r\nsuch a capital boy.\"\r\n\r\nWhen they entered the ball-room she clung close to him, gazing with\r\ndelighted eyes on the girls and the bullies, and from time to time, as\r\nthough to reassure herself as regards any possible danger, saying, as\r\nshe noticed some serious and motionless municipal guard: \"That is a\r\nstrong-looking fellow.\" In a quarter of an hour she had had enough of it\r\nand he escorted her home.\r\n\r\nThen began quite a series of excursions in all the queer places where\r\nthe common people amuse themselves, and Duroy discovered in his mistress\r\nquite a liking for this vagabondage of students bent on a spree. She\r\ncame to their meeting-place in a cotton frock and with a servant's\r\ncap--a theatrical servant's cap--on her head; and despite the elegant\r\nand studied simplicity of her toilet, retained her rings, her bracelets,\r\nand her diamond earrings, saying, when he begged her to remove them:\r\n\"Bah! they will think they are paste.\"\r\n\r\nShe thought she was admirably disguised, and although she was really\r\nonly concealed after the fashion of an ostrich, she went into the most\r\nill-famed drinking places. She wanted Duroy to dress himself like a\r\nworkman, but he resisted, and retained his correct attire, without even\r\nconsenting to exchange his tall hat for one of soft felt. She was\r\nconsoled for this obstinacy on his part by the reflection that she would\r\nbe taken for a chambermaid engaged in a love affair with a gentleman,\r\nand thought this delightful. In this guise they went into popular\r\nwine-shops, and sat down on rickety chairs at old wooden tables in\r\nsmoke-filled rooms. A cloud of strong tobacco smoke, with which still\r\nblended the smell of fish fried at dinner time, filled the room; men in\r\nblouses shouted at one another as they tossed off nips of spirits; and\r\nthe astonished waiter would stare at this strange couple as he placed\r\nbefore them two cherry brandies. She--trembling, fearsome, yet\r\ncharmed--began to sip the red liquid, looking round her with uneasy and\r\nkindling eye. Each cherry swallowed gave her the sensation of a sin\r\ncommitted, each drop of burning liquor flowing down her throat gave her\r\n\r\nthe pleasure of a naughty and forbidden joy.\r\n\r\nThen she would say, \"Let us go,\" and they would leave. She would pass\r\nrapidly, with bent head and the short steps of an actress leaving the\r\nstage, among the drinkers, who, with their elbows on the tables, watched\r\nher go by with suspicious and dissatisfied glances; and when she had\r\ncrossed the threshold would give a deep sigh, as if she had just escaped\r\nsome terrible danger.\r\n\r\nSometimes she asked Duroy, with a shudder: \"If I were insulted in these\r\nplaces, what would you do?\"\r\n\r\nHe would answer, with a swaggering air: \"Take your part, by Jove!\"\r\n\r\nAnd she would clasp his arm with happiness, with, perhaps, a vague wish\r\nto be insulted and defended, to see men fight on her account, even such\r\nmen as those, with her lover.\r\n\r\nBut these excursions taking place two or three times a week began to\r\nweary Duroy, who had great difficulty, besides, for some time past, in\r\nprocuring the ten francs necessary for the cake and the drinks. He now\r\nlived very hardly and with more difficulty than when he was a clerk in\r\nthe Northern Railway; for having spent lavishly during his first month\r\nof journalism, in the constant hope of gaining large sums of money in a\r\nday or two, he had exhausted all his resources and all means of\r\nprocuring money. A very simple method, that of borrowing from the\r\ncashier, was very soon exhausted; and he already owed the paper four\r\nmonths' salary, besides six hundred francs advanced on his lineage\r\naccount. He owed, besides, a hundred francs to Forestier, three hundred\r\nto Jacques Rival, who was free-handed with his money; and he was also\r\neaten up by a number of small debts of from five francs to twenty.\r\nSaint-Potin, consulted as to the means of raising another hundred\r\nfrancs, had discovered no expedient, although a man of inventive mind,\r\nand Duroy was exasperated at this poverty, of which he was more sensible\r\nnow than formerly, since he had more wants. A sullen rage against\r\neveryone smouldered within him, with an ever-increasing irritation,\r\n\r\nwhich manifested itself at every moment on the most futile pretexts. He\r\nsometimes asked himself how he could have spent an average of a thousand\r\nfrancs a month, without any excess and the gratification of any\r\nextravagant fancy, and he found that, by adding a lunch at eight\r\nfrancs to a dinner at twelve, partaken of in some large cafe on the\r\nboulevards, he at once came to a louis, which, added to ten francs\r\npocket-money--that pocket-money that melts away, one does not know\r\nhow--makes a total of thirty francs. But thirty francs a day is nine\r\nhundred francs at the end of the month. And he did not reckon in the\r\ncost of clothes, boots, linen, washing, etc.\r\n\r\nSo on the 14th December he found himself without a sou in his pocket,\r\nand without a notion in his mind how to get any money. He went, as he\r\nhad often done of old, without lunch, and passed the afternoon working\r\nat the newspaper office, angry and preoccupied. About four o'clock he\r\nreceived a telegram from his mistress, running: \"Shall we dine together,\r\nand have a lark afterwards?\"\r\n\r\nHe at once replied: \"Cannot dine.\" Then he reflected that he would be\r\nvery stupid to deprive himself of the pleasant moments she might afford\r\nhim, and added: \"But will wait at nine at our place.\" And having sent\r\none of the messengers with this, to save the cost of a telegram, he\r\nbegan to reflect what he should do to procure himself a dinner.\r\n\r\nAt seven o'clock he had not yet hit upon anything and a terrible hunger\r\nassailed him. Then he had recourse to the stratagem of a despairing man.\r\nHe let all his colleagues depart, one after the other, and when he was\r\nalone rang sharply. Monsieur Walter's messenger, left in charge of the\r\noffices, came in. Duroy was standing feeling in his pockets, and said in\r\nan abrupt voice: \"Foucart, I have left my purse at home, and I have to\r\ngo and dine at the Luxembourg. Lend me fifty sous for my cab.\"\r\n\r\nThe man took three francs from his waistcoat pocket and said: \"Do you\r\nwant any more, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, that will be enough. Thanks.\"\r\n\r\nAnd having seized on the coins, Duroy ran downstairs and dined at a\r\nslap-bank, to which he drifted on his days of poverty.\r\n\r\nAt nine o'clock he was awaiting his mistress, with his feet on the\r\nfender, in the little sitting-room. She came in, lively and animated,\r\nbrisked up by the keen air of the street. \"If you like,\" said she, \"we\r\nwill first go for a stroll, and then come home here at eleven. The\r\nweather is splendid for walking.\"\r\n\r\nHe replied, in a grumbling tone: \"Why go out? We are very comfortable\r\nhere.\"\r\n\r\nShe said, without taking off her bonnet: \"If you knew, the moonlight is\r\nbeautiful. It is splendid walking about to-night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps so, but I do not care for walking about!\"\r\n\r\nHe had said this in an angry fashion. She was struck and hurt by it, and\r\nasked: \"What is the matter with you? Why do you go on in this way? I\r\nshould like to go for a stroll, and I don't see how that can vex you.\"\r\n\r\nHe got up in a rage. \"It does not vex me. It is a bother, that is all.\"\r\n\r\nShe was one of those sort of women whom resistance irritates and\r\nimpoliteness exasperates, and she said disdainfully and with angry calm:\r\n\"I am not accustomed to be spoken to like that. I will go alone, then.\r\nGood-bye.\"\r\n\r\nHe understood that it was serious, and darting towards her, seized her\r\nhands and kissed them, saying: \"Forgive me, darling, forgive me. I am\r\nvery nervous this evening, very irritable. I have had vexations and\r\nannoyances, you know--matters of business.\"\r\n\r\nShe replied, somewhat softened, but not calmed down: \"That does not\r\nconcern me, and I will not bear the consequences of your ill-temper.\"\r\n\r\nHe took her in his arms, and drew her towards the couch.\r\n\r\n\"Listen, darling, I did not want to hurt you; I was not thinking of what\r\nI was saying.\"\r\n\r\nHe had forced her to sit down, and, kneeling before her, went on: \"Have\r\nyou forgiven me? Tell me you have forgiven me?\"\r\n\r\nShe murmured, coldly: \"Very well, but do not do so again;\" and rising,\r\nshe added: \"Now let us go for a stroll.\"\r\n\r\nHe had remained at her feet, with his arms clasped about her hips, and\r\nstammered: \"Stay here, I beg of you. Grant me this much. I should so\r\nlike to keep you here this evening all to myself, here by the fire. Say\r\nyes, I beg of you, say yes.\"\r\n\r\nShe answered plainly and firmly: \"No, I want to go out, and I am not\r\ngoing to give way to your fancies.\"\r\n\r\nHe persisted. \"I beg of you, I have a reason, a very serious reason.\"\r\n\r\nShe said again: \"No; and if you won't go out with me, I shall go.\r\nGood-bye.\"\r\n\r\nShe had freed herself with a jerk, and gained the door. He ran towards\r\nher, and clasped her in his arms, crying:\r\n\r\n\"Listen, Clo, my little Clo; listen, grant me this much.\"\r\n\r\nShe shook her head without replying, avoiding his kisses, and striving\r\nto escape from his grasp and go.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe stammered: \"Clo, my little Clo, I have a reason.\"\r\n\r\nShe stopped, and looking him full in the face, said: \"You are lying.\r\nWhat is it?\"\r\n\r\nHe blushed not knowing what to say, and she went on in an indignant\r\ntone: \"You see very well that you are lying, you low brute.\" And with an\r\nangry gesture and tears in her eyes, she escaped him.\r\n\r\nHe again caught her by the shoulders, and, in despair, ready to\r\nacknowledge anything in order to avoid a rupture, he said, in a\r\ndespairing tone: \"I have not a son. That's what it all means.\" She\r\nstopped short, and looking into his eyes to read the truth in them,\r\nsaid: \"You say?\"\r\n\r\nHe had flushed to the roots of his hair. \"I say that I have not a sou.\r\nDo you understand? Not twenty sous, not ten, not enough to pay for a\r\nglass of cassis in the cafe we may go into. You force me to confess what\r\nI am ashamed of. It was, however, impossible for me to go out with you,\r\nand when we were seated with refreshments in front of us to tell you\r\nquietly that I could not pay for them.\"\r\n\r\nShe was still looking him in the face. \"It is true, then?\"\r\n\r\nIn a moment he had turned out all his pockets, those of his trousers,\r\ncoat, and waistcoat, and murmured: \"There, are you satisfied now?\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly opening her arms, in an outburst of passion, she threw them\r\naround his neck, crying: \"Oh, my poor darling, my poor darling, if I had\r\nonly known. How did it happen?\"\r\n\r\nShe made him sit down, and sat down herself on his knees; then, with her\r\narm round his neck, kissing him every moment on his moustache, his\r\nmouth, his eyes, she obliged him to tell her how this misfortune had\r\ncome about.\r\n\r\nHe invented a touching story. He had been obliged to come to the\r\nassistance of his father, who found himself in difficulties. He had not\r\nonly handed over to him all his savings, but had even incurred heavy\r\ndebts on his behalf. He added: \"I shall be pinched to the last degree\r\nfor at least six months, for I have exhausted all my resources. So much\r\nthe worse; there are crises in every life. Money, after all, is not\r\nworth troubling about.\"\r\n\r\nShe whispered: \"I will lend you some; will you let me?\"\r\n\r\nHe answered, with dignity: \"You are very kind, pet; but do not think of\r\nthat, I beg of you. You would hurt my feelings.\"\r\n\r\nShe was silent, and then clasping him in her arms, murmured: \"You will\r\nnever know how much I love you.\"\r\n\r\nIt was one of their most pleasant evenings.\r\n\r\nAs she was leaving, she remarked, smilingly: \"How nice it is when one is\r\nin your position to find money you had forgotten in your pocket--a coin\r\nthat had worked its way between the stuff and the lining.\"\r\n\r\nHe replied, in a tone of conviction: \"Ah, yes, that it is.\"\r\n\r\nShe insisted on walking home, under the pretense that the moon was\r\nbeautiful and went into ecstasies over it. It was a cold, still night at\r\nthe beginning of winter. Pedestrians and horses went by quickly, spurred\r\nby a sharp frost. Heels rang on the pavement. As she left him she said:\r\n\"Shall we meet again the day after to-morrow?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly.\"\r\n\r\n\"At the same time?\"\r\n\r\n\"The same time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-bye, dearest.\" And they kissed lovingly.\r\n\r\nThen he walked home swiftly, asking himself what plan he could hit on\r\nthe morrow to get out of his difficulty. But as he opened the door of\r\nhis room, and fumbled in his waistcoat pocket for a match, he was\r\nstupefied to find a coin under his fingers. As soon as he had a light he\r\nhastened to examine it. It was a louis. He thought he must be mad. He\r\nturned it over and over, seeking by what miracle it could have found\r\nits way there. It could not, however, have fallen from heaven into his\r\npocket.\r\n\r\nThen all at once he guessed, and an angry indignation awoke within him.\r\nHis mistress had spoken of money slipping into the lining, and being\r\nfound in times of poverty. It was she who had tendered him this alms.\r\nHow shameful! He swore: \"Ah! I'll talk to her the day after to-morrow.\r\nShe shall have a nice time over it.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he went to bed, his heart filled with anger and humiliation.\r\n\r\nHe woke late. He was hungry. He tried to go to sleep again, in order not\r\nto get up till two o'clock, and then said to himself: \"That will not\r\nforward matters. I must end by finding some money.\" Then he went out,\r\nhoping that an idea might occur to him in the street. It did not; but at\r\nevery restaurant he passed a longing to eat made his mouth water. As by\r\nnoon he had failed to hit on any plan, he suddenly made up his mind: \"I\r\nwill lunch out of Clotilde's twenty francs. That won't hinder me from\r\npaying them back to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nHe, therefore, lunched for two francs fifty centimes. On reaching the\r\noffice he also gave three francs to the messenger, saying: \"Here,\r\nFoucart, here is the money you lent me last night for my cab.\"\r\n\r\nHe worked till seven o'clock. Then he went and dined taking another\r\nthree francs. The two evening bocks brought the expenditure of the day\r\nup to nine francs thirty centimes. But as he could not re-establish a\r\ncredit or create fresh resources in twenty-four hours, he borrowed\r\nanother six francs fifty centimes the next day from the twenty he was\r\ngoing to return that very evening, so that he came to keep his\r\nappointment with just four francs twenty centimes in his pocket.\r\n\r\nHe was in a deuce of a temper, and promised himself that he would pretty\r\nsoon explain things. He would say to his mistress: \"You know, I found\r\nthe twenty francs you slipped into my pocket the other day. I cannot\r\ngive them back to you now, because my situation is unaltered, and I have\r\nnot had time to occupy myself with money matters. But I will give them\r\nto you the next time we meet.\"\r\n\r\nShe arrived, loving, eager, full of alarm. How would he receive her? She\r\nkissed him persistently to avoid an explanation at the outset.\r\n\r\nHe said to himself: \"It will be time enough to enter on the matter\r\nby-and-by. I will find an opportunity of doing so.\"\r\n\r\nHe did not find the opportunity, and said nothing, shirking before the\r\ndifficulty of opening this delicate subject. She did not speak of going\r\nout, and was in every way charming. They separated about midnight, after\r\nmaking an appointment for the Wednesday of the following week, for\r\nMadame de Marelle was engaged to dine out several days in succession.\r\n\r\nThe next day, as Duroy, on paying for his breakfast, felt for the four\r\ncoins that ought to be remaining to him, he perceived that they were\r\nfive, and one of them a gold one. At the outset he thought that he had\r\nreceived it by mistake in his change the day before, then he understood\r\nit, and his heart throbbed with humiliation at this persistent charity.\r\nHow he now regretted not having said anything! If he had spoken\r\nenergetically this would not have happened.\r\n\r\nFor four days he made efforts, as numerous as they were fruitless, to\r\nraise five louis, and spent Clotilde's second one. She managed, although\r\nhe had said to her savagely, \"Don't play that joke of the other\r\nevening's again, or I shall get angry,\" to slip another twenty francs\r\ninto his trouser pockets the first time they met. When he found them he\r\nswore bitterly, and transferred them to his waistcoat to have them under\r\nhis hand, for he had not a rap. He appeased his conscience by this\r\nargument: \"I will give it all back to her in a lump. After all, it is\r\nonly borrowed money.\"\r\n\r\nAt length the cashier of the paper agreed, on his desperate appeals, to\r\nlet him have five francs daily. It was just enough to live upon, but not\r\nenough to repay sixty francs with. But as Clotilde was again seized by\r\nher passion for nocturnal excursions in all the suspicious localities in\r\nParis, he ended by not being unbearably annoyed to find a yellow boy in\r\none of his pockets, once even in his boot, and another time in his\r\nwatch-case, after their adventurous excursions. Since she had wishes\r\nwhich he could not for the moment gratify himself, was it not natural\r\nthat she should pay for them rather than go without them? He kept an\r\naccount, too, of all he received in this way, in order to return it to\r\nher some day.\r\n\r\nOne evening she said to him: \"Would you believe that I have never been\r\nto the Folies-Bergere? Will you take me there?\"\r\n\r\nHe hesitated a moment, afraid of meeting Rachel. Then he thought: \"Bah!\r\nI am not married, after all. If that girl sees me she will understand\r\nthe state of things, and will not speak to me. Besides, we will have a\r\nbox.\"\r\n\r\nAnother reason helped his decision. He was well pleased of this\r\nopportunity of offering Madame de Marelle a box at the theater without\r\nits costing anything. It was a kind of compensation.\r\n\r\nHe left her in the cab while he got the order for the box, in order that\r\nshe might not see it offered him, and then came to fetch her. They went\r\nin, and were received with bows by the acting manager. An immense crowd\r\nfilled the lounge, and they had great difficulty in making their way\r\nthrough the swarm of men and women. At length they reached the box and\r\nsettled themselves in it, shut in between the motionless orchestra and\r\nthe eddy of the gallery. But Madame de Marelle rarely glanced at the\r\nstage. Wholly taken up with the women promenading behind her back, she\r\nconstantly turned round to look at them, with a longing to touch them,\r\nto feel their bodices, their skirts, their hair, to know what these\r\ncreatures were made of.\r\n\r\nSuddenly she said: \"There is a stout, dark girl who keeps watching us\r\nall the time. I thought just now that she was going to speak to us. Did\r\nyou notice her?\"\r\n\r\nHe answered: \"No, you must be mistaken.\" But he had already noticed her\r\nfor some time back. It was Rachel who was prowling about in their\r\nneighborhood, with anger in her eyes and hard words upon her lips.\r\n\r\nDuroy had brushed against her in making his way through the crowd, and\r\nshe had whispered, \"Good evening,\" with a wink which signified, \"I\r\nunderstand.\" But he had not replied to this mark of attention for fear\r\nof being seen by his mistress, and he had passed on coldly, with haughty\r\nlook and disdainful lip. The woman, whom unconscious jealousy already\r\nassailed, turned back, brushed against him again, and said in louder\r\ntones: \"Good evening, George.\" He had not answered even then. Then she\r\nmade up her mind to be recognized and bowed to, and she kept continually\r\npassing in the rear of the box, awaiting a favorable moment.\r\n\r\nAs soon as she saw that Madame de Marelle was looking at her she touched\r\nDuroy's shoulder, saying: \"Good evening, are you quite well?\"\r\n\r\nHe did not turn round, and she went on: \"What, have you grown deaf since\r\nThursday?\" He did not reply, affecting a contempt which would not allow\r\nhim to compromise himself even by a word with this slut.\r\n\r\nShe began to laugh an angry laugh, and said: \"So you are dumb, then?\r\nPerhaps the lady has bitten your tongue off?\"\r\n\r\nHe made an angry movement, and exclaimed, in an exasperated tone: \"What\r\ndo you mean by speaking to me? Be off, or I will have you locked up.\"\r\n\r\nThen, with fiery eye and swelling bosom, she screeched out: \"So that's\r\nit, is it? Ah! you lout. When a man sleeps with a woman the least he can\r\ndo is to nod to her. It is no reason because you are with someone else\r\nthat you should cut me to-day. If you had only nodded to me when I\r\npassed you just now, I should have left you alone. But you wanted to do\r\nthe grand. I'll pay you out! Ah, so you won't say good evening when you\r\nmeet me!\"\r\n\r\nShe would have gone on for a long time, but Madame de Marelle had opened\r\nthe door of the box and fled through the crowd, blindly seeking the way\r\nout. Duroy started off in her rear and strove to catch her up, while\r\nRachel, seeing them flee, yelled triumphantly: \"Stop her, she has stolen\r\nmy sweetheart.\"\r\n\r\nPeople began to laugh. Two gentlemen for fun seized the fugitive by the\r\nshoulders and sought to bring her back, trying, too, to kiss her. But\r\nDuroy, having caught her up, freed her forcibly and led her away into\r\nthe street. She jumped into an empty cab standing at the door. He jumped\r\nin after her, and when the driver asked, \"Where to, sir?\" replied,\r\n\"Wherever you like.\"\r\n\r\nThe cab slowly moved off, jolting over the paving stones. Clotilde,\r\nseized by a kind of hysterical attack, sat choking and gasping with her\r\nhands covering her face, and Duroy neither knew what to do nor what to\r\nsay. At last, as he heard her sobbing, he stammered out: \"Clo, my dear\r\nlittle Clo, just listen, let me explain. It is not my fault. I used to\r\nknow that woman, some time ago, you know--\"\r\n\r\nShe suddenly took her hands from her face, and overcome by the wrath of\r\na loving and deceitful woman, a furious wrath that enabled her to\r\nrecover her speech, she pantingly jerked out, in rapid and broken\r\nsentences: \"Oh!--you wretch--you wretch--what a scoundrel you are--can\r\nit be possible? How shameful--O Lord--how shameful!\" Then, getting\r\nangrier and angrier as her ideas grew clearer and arguments suggested\r\nthemselves to her, she went on: \"It was with my money you paid her,\r\nwasn't it? And I was giving him money--for that creature. Oh, the\r\nscoundrel!\" She seemed for a few minutes to be seeking some stronger\r\nexpression that would not come, and then all at once she spat out, as it\r\nwere, the words: \"Oh! you swine--you swine--you swine--you paid her\r\nwith my money--you swine--you swine!\" She could not think of anything\r\nelse, and kept repeating, \"You swine, you swine!\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly she leant out of the window, and catching the driver by the\r\nsleeve, cried, \"Stop,\" and opening the door, sprang out.\r\n\r\nGeorge wanted to follow, but she cried, \"I won't have you get out,\" in\r\nsuch loud tones that the passers-by began to gather about her, and Duroy\r\ndid not move for fear of a scandal. She took her purse from her pocket\r\nand looked for some change by the light of the cab lantern, then taking\r\ntwo francs fifty centimes she put them in the driver's hand, saying, in\r\nringing tones: \"There is your fare--I pay you, now take this blackguard\r\nto the Rue Boursault, Batignolles.\"\r\n\r\nMirth was aroused in the group surrounding her. A gentleman said: \"Well\r\ndone, little woman,\" and a young rapscallion standing close to the cab\r\nthrust his head into the open door and sang out, in shrill tones,\r\n\"Good-night, lovey!\" Then the cab started off again, followed by a burst\r\nof laughter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge Duroy woke up chapfallen the next morning.\r\n\r\nHe dressed himself slowly, and then sat down at his window and began to\r\nreflect. He felt a kind of aching sensation all over, just as though he\r\nhad received a drubbing over night. At last the necessity of finding\r\nsome money spurred him up, and he went first to Forestier.\r\n\r\nHis friend received him in his study with his feet on the fender.\r\n\r\n\"What has brought you out so early?\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"A very serious matter, a debt of honor.\"\r\n\r\n\"At play?\"\r\n\r\nHe hesitated a moment, and then said: \"At play.\"\r\n\r\n\"Heavy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Five hundred francs.\"\r\n\r\nHe only owed two hundred and eighty.\r\n\r\nForestier, skeptical on the point, inquired: \"Whom do you owe it to?\"\r\n\r\nDuroy could not answer right off. \"To--to--a Monsieur de Carleville.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! and where does he live?\"\r\n\r\n\"At--at--\"\r\n\r\nForestier began to laugh. \"Number ought, Nowhere Street, eh? I know that\r\ngentleman, my dear fellow. If you want twenty francs, I have still that\r\nmuch at your service, but no more.\"\r\n\r\nDuroy took the offered louis. Then he went from door to door among the\r\npeople he knew, and wound up by having collected at about five o'clock\r\nthe sum of eighty francs. And he still needed two hundred more; he made\r\nup his mind, and keeping for himself what he had thus gleaned, murmured:\r\n\"Bah! I am not going to put myself out for that cat. I will pay her when\r\nI can.\"\r\n\r\nFor a fortnight he lived regularly, economically, and chastely, his mind\r\nfilled with energetic resolves. Then he was seized with a strong longing\r\nfor love. It seemed to him that several years had passed since he last\r\nclasped a woman in his arms, and like the sailor who goes wild on seeing\r\nland, every passing petticoat made him quiver. So he went one evening\r\nto the Folies Bergere in the hope of finding Rachel. He caught sight of\r\nher indeed, directly he entered, for she scarcely went elsewhere, and\r\nwent up to her smiling with outstretched hand. But she merely looked him\r\ndown from head to foot, saying: \"What do you want with me?\"\r\n\r\nHe tried to laugh it off with, \"Come, don't be stuck-up.\"\r\n\r\nShe turned on her heels, saying: \"I don't associate with ponces.\"\r\n\r\nShe had picked out the bitterest insult. He felt the blood rush to his\r\nface, and went home alone.\r\n\r\nForestier, ill, weak, always coughing, led him a hard life at the paper,\r\nand seemed to rack his brain to find him tiresome jobs. One day, even,\r\nin a moment of nervous irritation, and after a long fit of coughing, as\r\nDuroy had not brought him a piece of information he wanted, he growled\r\nout: \"Confound it! you are a bigger fool than I thought.\"\r\n\r\nThe other almost struck him, but restrained himself, and went away\r\nmuttering: \"I'll manage to pay you out some day.\" An idea shot through\r\nhis mind, and he added: \"I will make a cuckold of you, old fellow!\" And\r\nhe took himself off, rubbing his hands, delighted at this project.\r\n\r\nHe resolved to set about it the very next day. He paid Madame Forestier\r\na visit as a reconnaissance. He found her lying at full length on a\r\ncouch, reading a book. She held out her hand without rising, merely\r\nturning her head, and said: \"Good-day, Pretty-boy!\"\r\n\r\nHe felt as though he had received a blow. \"Why do you call me that?\" he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nShe replied, with a smile: \"I saw Madame de Marelle the other day, and\r\nlearned how you had been baptized at her place.\"\r\n\r\nHe felt reassured by her amiable air. Besides, what was there for him to\r\nbe afraid of?\r\n\r\nShe resumed: \"You spoil her. As to me, people come to see me when they\r\nthink of it--the thirty-second of the month, or something like it.\"\r\n\r\nHe sat down near her, and regarded her with a new species of curiosity,\r\nthe curiosity of the amateur who is bargain-hunting. She was charming, a\r\nsoft and tender blonde, made for caresses, and he thought: \"She is\r\nbetter than the other, certainly.\" He did not doubt his success, it\r\nseemed to him that he had only to stretch out his hand and take her, as\r\none gathers a fruit.\r\n\r\nHe said, resolutely: \"I did not come to see you, because it was better\r\nso.\"\r\n\r\nShe asked, without understanding: \"What? Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, not at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I am in love with you; oh! only a little, and I do not want to\r\nbe head over ears.\"\r\n\r\nShe seemed neither astonished, nor shocked, nor flattered; she went on\r\nsmiling the same indifferent smile, and replied with the same\r\ntranquillity: \"Oh! you can come all the same. No one is in love with me\r\nlong.\"\r\n\r\nHe was surprised, more by the tone than by the words, and asked: \"Why\r\nnot?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because it is useless. I let this be understood at once. If you had\r\ntold me of your fear before, I should have reassured you, and invited\r\nyou, on the contrary, to come as often as possible.\"\r\n\r\nHe exclaimed, in a pathetic tone: \"Can we command our feelings?\"\r\n\r\nShe turned towards him: \"My dear friend, for me a man in love is struck\r\noff the list of the living. He becomes idiotic, and not only idiotic,\r\nbut dangerous. I cease all intimate relations with people who are in\r\nlove with me, or who pretend to be so--because they bore me, in the\r\nfirst place; and, secondly, because they are as much objects of\r\nsuspicion to me as a mad dog, which may have a fit of biting. I\r\ntherefore put them into a kind of moral quarantine until their illness\r\nis over. Do not forget this. I know very well that in your case love is\r\nonly a species of appetite, while with me it would be, on the contrary,\r\na kind of--of--of communion of souls, which does not enter into a man's\r\nreligion. You understand its letter, and its spirit. But look me well in\r\nthe face.\" She no longer smiled. Her face was calm and cold, and she\r\ncontinued, emphatically: \"I will never, never be your mistress; you\r\nunderstand. It is therefore absolutely useless, it would even be\r\nhurtful, for you to persist in this desire. And now that the operation\r\nis over, will you agree to be friends--good friends--real friends, I\r\nmean, without any mental reservation.\"\r\n\r\nHe had understood that any attempt would be useless in face of this\r\nirrevocable sentence. He made up his mind at once, frankly, and,\r\ndelighted at being able to secure this ally in the battle of life, held\r\nout both hands, saying: \"I am yours, madame, as you will.\"\r\n\r\nShe read the sincerity of his intention in his voice, and gave him her\r\nhands. He kissed them both, one after the other, and then said simply,\r\nas he raised his head: \"Ah, if I had found a woman like you, how gladly\r\nI would have married her.\"\r\n\r\nShe was touched this time--soothed by this phrase, as women are by the\r\ncompliments which reach their hearts, and she gave him one of those\r\nrapid and grateful looks which make us their slaves. Then, as he could\r\nfind no change of subject to renew the conversation, she said softly,\r\nlaying her finger on his arm: \"And I am going to play my part of a\r\nfriend at once. You are clumsy.\" She hesitated a moment, and then asked:\r\n\"May I speak plainly?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite plainly?\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, go and see Madame Walter, who greatly appreciates you, and do\r\nyour best to please her. You will find a place there for your\r\ncompliments, although she is virtuous, you understand me, perfectly\r\nvirtuous. Oh! there is no hope of--of poaching there, either. You may\r\nfind something better, though, by showing yourself. I know that you\r\nstill hold an inferior position on the paper. But do not be afraid, they\r\nreceive all their staff with the same kindness. Go there--believe me.\"\r\n\r\nHe said, with a smile: \"Thanks, you are an angel, a guardian angel.\"\r\n\r\nThey spoke of one thing and another. He stayed for some time, wishing to\r\nprove that he took pleasure in being with her, and on leaving, remarked:\r\n\"It is understood, then, that we are friends?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is.\"\r\n\r\nAs he had noted the effect of the compliment he had paid her shortly\r\nbefore, he seconded it by adding: \"And if ever you become a widow, I\r\nenter the lists.\"\r\n\r\nThen he hurried away, so as not to give her time to get angry.\r\n\r\nA visit to Madame Walter was rather awkward for Duroy, for he had not\r\nbeen authorized to call, and he did not want to commit a blunder. The\r\ngovernor displayed some good will towards him, appreciated his services,\r\nand employed him by preference on difficult jobs, so why should he not\r\nprofit by this favor to enter the house? One day, then, having risen\r\nearly, he went to the market while the morning sales were in progress,\r\nand for ten francs obtained a score of splendid pears. Having carefully\r\npacked them in a hamper to make it appear that they had come from a\r\ndistance, he left them with the doorkeeper at Madame Walter's with his\r\ncard, on which he had written: \"George Duroy begs Madame Walter to\r\naccept a little fruit which he received this morning from Normandy.\"\r\n\r\nHe found the next morning, among his letters at the office, an envelope\r\nin reply, containing the card of Madame Walter, who \"thanked Monsieur\r\nGeorge Duroy, and was at home every Saturday.\"\r\n\r\nOn the following Saturday he called. Monsieur Walter occupied, on the\r\nBoulevard Malesherbes, a double house, which belonged to him, and of\r\nwhich a part was let off, in the economical way of practical people. A\r\nsingle doorkeeper, quartered between the two carriage entrances, opened\r\nthe door for both landlord and tenant, and imparted to each of the\r\nentrances an air of wealth by his get-up like a beadle, his big calves\r\nin white stockings, and his coat with gilt buttons and scarlet facings.\r\nThe reception-rooms were on the first floor, preceded by an ante-room\r\nhung with tapestry, and shut in by curtains over the doorways. Two\r\nfootmen were dozing on benches. One of them took Duroy's overcoat and\r\nthe other relieved him of his cane, opened the door, advanced a few\r\nsteps in front of the visitor, and then drawing aside, let him pass,\r\ncalling out his name, into an empty room.\r\n\r\nThe young fellow, somewhat embarrassed, looked round on all sides when\r\nhe perceived in a glass some people sitting down who seemed very far\r\noff. He was at sea at first as to the direction in which they were, the\r\nmirror having deceived his eyes. Then he passed through two empty\r\ndrawing-rooms and reached a small boudoir hung with blue silk, where\r\nfour ladies were chatting round a table bearing cups of tea. Despite the\r\nassurance he had acquired in course of his Parisian life, and above all\r\nin his career as a reporter, which constantly brought him into contact\r\nwith important personages, Duroy felt somewhat intimidated by the get-up\r\nof the entrance and the passage through the deserted drawing-room. He\r\nstammered: \"Madame, I have ventured,\" as his eyes sought the mistress of\r\nthe house.\r\n\r\nShe held out her hand, which he took with a bow, and having remarked:\r\n\"You are very kind sir, to call and see me,\" she pointed to a chair, in\r\nseeking to sit down in which he almost fell, having thought it much\r\nhigher.\r\n\r\nThey had become silent. One of the ladies began to talk again. It was a\r\nquestion of the frost, which was becoming sharper, though not enough,\r\nhowever, to check the epidemic of typhoid fever, nor to allow skating.\r\nEvery one gave her opinion on this advent of frost in Paris, then they\r\nexpressed their preference for the different seasons with all the\r\ntrivial reasons that lie about in people's minds like dust in rooms. The\r\nfaint noise made by a door caused Duroy to turn his head, and he saw in\r\na glass a stout lady approaching. As soon as she made her appearance in\r\nthe boudoir one of the other visitors rose, shook hands and left, and\r\nthe young fellow followed her black back glittering with jet through the\r\ndrawing-rooms with his eyes. When the agitation due to this change had\r\nsubsided they spoke without transition of the Morocco question and the\r\nwar in the East and also of the difficulties of England in South Africa.\r\nThese ladies discussed these matters from memory, as if they had been\r\nreciting passages from a fashionable play, frequently rehearsed.\r\n\r\nA fresh arrival took place, that of a little curly-headed blonde, which\r\nbrought about the departure of a tall, thin lady of middle age. They now\r\nspoke of the chance Monsieur Linet had of getting into the\r\nAcademie-Francaise. The new-comer formerly believed that he would be\r\nbeaten by Monsieur Cabanon-Lebas, the author of the fine dramatic\r\nadaption of Don Quixote in verse.\r\n\r\n\"You know it is to be played at the Odeon next winter?\"\r\n\r\n\"Really, I shall certainly go and see such a very excellent literary\r\neffort.\"\r\n\r\nMadame Walter answered gracefully with calm indifference, without ever\r\nhesitating as to what she should say, her mind being always made up\r\nbeforehand. But she saw that night was coming on, and rang for the\r\nlamps, while listening to the conversation that trickled on like a\r\nstream of honey, and thinking that she had forgotten to call on the\r\nstationer about the invitation cards for her next dinner. She was a\r\nlittle too stout, though still beautiful, at the dangerous age when the\r\ngeneral break-up is at hand. She preserved herself by dint of care,\r\nhygienic precautions, and salves for the skin. She seemed discreet in\r\nall matters; moderate and reasonable; one of those women whose mind is\r\ncorrectly laid out like a French garden. One walks through it with\r\nsurprise, but experiencing a certain charm. She had keen, discreet, and\r\nsound sense, that stood her instead of fancy, generosity, and affection,\r\ntogether with a calm kindness for everybody and everything.\r\n\r\nShe noted that Duroy had not said anything, that he had not been spoken\r\nto, and that he seemed slightly ill at ease; and as the ladies had not\r\nyet quitted the Academy, that favorite subject always occupying them\r\nsome time, she said: \"And you who should be better informed than any\r\none, Monsieur Duroy, who is your favorite?\"\r\n\r\nHe replied unhesitatingly: \"In this matter, madame, I should never\r\nconsider the merit, always disputable, of the candidates, but their age\r\nand their state of health. I should not ask about their credentials, but\r\ntheir disease. I should not seek to learn whether they have made a\r\nmetrical translation of Lope de Vega, but I should take care to obtain\r\ninformation as to the state of their liver, their heart, their lungs,\r\nand their spinal marrow. For me a good hypertrophy, a good aneurism, and\r\nabove all, a good beginning of locomotor ataxy, would be a hundred times\r\nmore valuable than forty volumes of disgressions on the idea of\r\npatriotism as embodied in barbaric poetry.\"\r\n\r\nAn astonished silence followed this opinion, and Madame Walter asked\r\nwith a smile: \"But why?\"\r\n\r\nHe replied: \"Because I never seek aught else than the pleasure that any\r\none can give the ladies. But, Madame, the Academy only has any real\r\ninterest for you when an Academician dies. The more of them die the\r\nhappier you must be. But in order that they may die quickly they must be\r\nelected sick and old.\" As they still remained somewhat surprised, he\r\ncontinued. \"Besides, I am like you, and I like to read of the death of\r\nan Academician. I at once ask myself: 'Who will replace him?' And I draw\r\nup my list. It is a game, a very pretty little game that is played in\r\nall Parisian salons at each decease of one of the Immortals, the game of\r\n'Death and the Forty Fogies.'\"\r\n\r\nThe ladies, still slightly disconcerted, began however, to smile, so\r\ntrue were his remarks. He concluded, as he rose: \"It is you who really\r\nelect them, ladies, and you only elect them to see them die. Choose them\r\nold, therefore, very old; as old as possible, and do not trouble\r\nyourselves about anything else.\"\r\n\r\nHe then retired very gracefully. As soon as he was gone, one of the\r\nladies said: \"He is very funny, that young fellow. Who is he?\"\r\n\r\nMadame Walter replied: \"One of the staff of our paper, who does not do\r\nmuch yet; but I feel sure that he will get on.\"\r\n\r\nDuroy strode gayly down the Boulevard Malesherbes, content with his\r\nexit, and murmuring: \"A capital start.\"\r\n\r\nHe made it up with Rachel that evening.\r\n\r\nThe following week two things happened to him. He was appointed chief\r\nreporter and invited to dinner at Madame Walter's. He saw at once a\r\nconnection between these things. The _Vie Francaise_ was before\r\neverything a financial paper, the head of it being a financier, to whom\r\nthe press and the position of a deputy served as levers. Making use of\r\nevery cordiality as a weapon, he had always worked under the smiling\r\nmask of a good fellow; but he only employed men whom he had sounded,\r\ntried, and proved; whom he knew to be crafty, bold, and supple. Duroy,\r\nappointed chief of the reporting staff, seemed to him a valuable fellow.\r\n\r\nThis duty had been filled up till then by the chief sub-editor, Monsieur\r\nBoisrenard, an old journalist, as correct, punctual, and scrupulous as a\r\nclerk. In course of thirty years he had been sub-editor of eleven\r\ndifferent papers, without in any way modifying his way of thinking or\r\nacting. He passed from one office to another as one changes one's\r\nrestaurant, scarcely noticing that the cookery was not quite the same.\r\nPolitical and religious opinions were foreign to him. He was devoted to\r\nhis paper, whatever it might be, well up in his work, and valuable from\r\nhis experience. He worked like a blind man who sees nothing, like a deaf\r\nman who hears nothing, and like a dumb man who never speaks of anything.\r\nHe had, however, a strong instinct of professional loyalty, and would\r\nnot stoop to aught he did not think honest and right from the special\r\npoint of view of his business.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Walter, who thoroughly appreciated him, had however, often\r\nwished for another man to whom to entrust the \"Echoes,\" which he held to\r\nbe the very marrow of the paper. It is through them that rumors are set\r\nafloat and the public and the funds influenced. It is necessary to know\r\nhow to slip the all-important matter, rather hinted at than said right\r\nout, in between the description of two fashionable entertainments,\r\nwithout appearing to intend it. It is necessary to imply a thing by\r\njudicious reservations; let what is desired be guessed at; contradict in\r\nsuch a fashion as to confirm, or affirm in such a way that no one shall\r\nbelieve the statement. It is necessary that in the \"Echoes\" everyone\r\nshall find every day at least one line of interest, in order that every\r\none may read them. Every one must be thought of, all classes, all\r\nprofessions, Paris and the provinces, the army and the art world, the\r\nclergy and the university, the bar and the world of gallantry. The man\r\nwho has the conduct of them, and who commands an army of reporters, must\r\nbe always on the alert and always on his guard; mistrustful, far-seeing,\r\ncunning, alert, and supple; armed with every kind of cunning, and gifted\r\nwith an infallible knack of spotting false news at the first glance, of\r\njudging which is good to announce and good to hide, of divining what\r\nwill catch the public, and of putting it forward in such a way as to\r\ndouble its effect.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Boisrenard, who had in his favor the skill acquired by long\r\nhabit, nevertheless lacked mastery and dash; he lacked, above all, the\r\nnative cunning needed to put forth day by day the secret ideas of the\r\nmanager. Duroy could do it to perfection, and was an admirable addition\r\nto the staff. The wire-pullers and real editors of the _Vie Francaise_\r\nwere half a dozen deputies, interested in all the speculations brought\r\nout or backed up by the manager. They were known in the Chamber as\r\n\"Walter's gang,\" and envied because they gained money with him and\r\nthrough him. Forestier, the political editor, was only the man of straw\r\nof these men of business, the worker-out of ideas suggested by them.\r\nThey prompted his leaders, which he always wrote at home, so as to do so\r\nin quiet, he said. But in order to give the paper a literary and truly\r\nParisian smack, the services of two celebrated writers in different\r\nstyles had been secured--Jacques Rival, a descriptive writer, and\r\nNorbert de Varenne, a poet and story-writer. To these had been added, at\r\na cheap rate, theatrical, musical and art critics, a law reporter, and a\r\nsporting reporter, from the mercenary tribe of all-round pressmen. Two\r\nladies, \"Pink Domino\" and \"Lily Fingers,\" sent in fashion articles, and\r\ndealt with questions of dress, etiquette, and society.\r\n\r\nDuroy was in all the joy of his appointment as chief of the \"Echoes\"\r\nwhen he received a printed card on which he read: \"Monsieur and Madame\r\nWalter request the pleasure of Monsieur Geo. Duroy's company at dinner,\r\non Thursday, January 20.\" This new mark of favor following on the other\r\nfilled him with such joy that he kissed the invitation as he would have\r\ndone a love letter. Then he went in search of the cashier to deal with\r\nthe important question of money. A chief of the reporting staff on a\r\nParis paper generally has his budget out of which he pays his reporters\r\nfor the intelligence, important or trifling, brought in by them, as\r\ngardeners bring in their fruits to a dealer. Twelve hundred francs a\r\nmonth were allotted at the outset to Duroy, who proposed to himself to\r\nretain a considerable share of it. The cashier, on his pressing\r\ninstances, ended by advancing him four hundred francs. He had at first\r\nthe intention of sending Madame de Marelle the two hundred and eighty\r\nfrancs he owed her, but he almost immediately reflected that he would\r\nonly have a hundred and twenty left, a sum utterly insufficient to carry\r\non his new duties in suitable fashion, and so put off this resolution to\r\na future day.\r\n\r\nDuring a couple of days he was engaged in settling down, for he had\r\ninherited a special table and a set of pigeon holes in the large room\r\nserving for the whole of the staff. He occupied one end of the room,\r\nwhile Boisrenard, whose head, black as a crow's, despite his age, was\r\nalways bent over a sheet of paper, had the other. The long table in the\r\nmiddle belonged to the staff. Generally it served them to sit on, either\r\nwith their legs dangling over the edges, or squatted like tailors in the\r\ncenter. Sometimes five or six would be sitting on it in that fashion,\r\nperseveringly playing cup and ball. Duroy had ended by having a taste\r\nfor this amusement, and was beginning to get expert at it, under the\r\nguidance, and thanks to the advice of Saint-Potin. Forestier, grown\r\nworse, had lent him his fine cup and ball in West Indian wood, the last\r\nhe had bought, and which he found rather too heavy for him, and Duroy\r\nswung with vigorous arm the big black ball at the end of its string,\r\ncounting quickly to himself: \"One--two--three--four--five--six.\" It\r\nhappened precisely that for the first time he spiked the ball twenty\r\ntimes running, the very day that he was to dine at Madame Walter's. \"A\r\ngood day,\" he thought, \"I am successful in everything.\" For skill at\r\ncup and ball really conferred a kind of superiority in the office of\r\nthe _Vie Francaise_.\r\n\r\nHe left the office early to have time to dress, and was going up the Rue\r\nde Londres when he saw, trotting along in front of him, a little woman\r\nwhose figure recalled that of Madame de Marelle. He felt his cheeks\r\nflush, and his heart began to beat. He crossed the road to get a view of\r\nher. She stopped, in order to cross over, too. He had made a mistake,\r\nand breathed again. He had often asked how he ought to behave if he met\r\nher face to face. Should he bow, or should he seem not to have seen\r\nher. \"I should not see her,\" he thought.\r\n\r\nIt was cold; the gutters were frozen, and the pavement dry and gray in\r\nthe gas-light. When he got home he thought: \"I must change my lodgings;\r\nthis is no longer good enough for me.\" He felt nervous and lively,\r\ncapable of anything; and he said aloud, as he walked from his bed to the\r\nwindow: \"It is fortune at last--it is fortune! I must write to father.\"\r\nFrom time to time he wrote to his father, and the letter always brought\r\nhappiness to the little Norman inn by the roadside, at the summit of the\r\nslope overlooking Rouen and the broad valley of the Seine. From time to\r\ntime, too, he received a blue envelope, addressed in a large, shaky\r\nhand, and read the same unvarying lines at the beginning of the paternal\r\nepistle. \"My Dear Son: This leaves your mother and myself in good\r\nhealth. There is not much news here. I must tell you, however,\" etc. In\r\nhis heart he retained a feeling of interest for the village matters, for\r\nthe news of the neighbours, and the condition of the crops.\r\n\r\nHe repeated to himself, as he tied his white tie before his little\r\nlooking-glass: \"I must write to father to-morrow. Wouldn't the old\r\nfellow be staggered if he could see me this evening in the house I am\r\ngoing to? By Jove! I am going to have such a dinner as he never tasted.\"\r\nAnd he suddenly saw the dark kitchen behind the empty _cafe_; the copper\r\nstewpans casting their yellow reflections on the wall; the cat on the\r\nhearth, with her nose to the fire, in sphinx-like attitude; the wooden\r\ntable, greasy with time and spilt liquids, a soup tureen smoking upon\r\nit, and a lighted candle between two plates. He saw them, too--his\r\nfather and mother, two slow-moving peasants, eating their soup. He knew\r\nthe smallest wrinkles on their old faces, the slightest movements of\r\ntheir arms and heads. He knew even what they talked about every evening\r\nas they sat at supper. He thought, too: \"I must really go and see them;\"\r\nbut his toilet being ended, he blew out his light and went downstairs.\r\n\r\nAs he passed along the outer boulevard girls accosted him from time to\r\ntime. He replied, as he pulled away his arm: \"Go to the devil!\" with a\r\nviolent disdain, as though they had insulted him. What did they take him\r\nfor? Could not these hussies tell what a man was? The sensation of his\r\ndress coat, put on in order to go to dinner with such well-known and\r\nimportant people, inspired him with the sentiment of a new\r\nimpersonality--the sense of having become another man, a man in society,\r\ngenuine society.\r\n\r\nHe entered the ante-room, lit by tall bronze candelabra, with\r\nconfidence, and handed in easy fashion his cane and overcoat to two\r\nvalets who approached. All the drawing-rooms were lit up. Madame Walter\r\nreceived her guests in the second, the largest. She welcomed him with a\r\ncharming smile, and he shook hands with two gentlemen who had arrived\r\nbefore him--Monsieur Firmin and Monsieur Laroche-Mathieu, deputies, and\r\nanonymous editors of the _Vie Francaise_. Monsieur Laroche-Mathieu had a\r\nspecial authority at the paper, due to a great influence he enjoyed in\r\nthe Chamber. No one doubted his being a minister some day. Then came the\r\nForestiers; the wife in pink, and looking charming. Duroy was stupefied\r\nto see her on terms of intimacy with the two deputies. She chatted in\r\nlow tones beside the fireplace, for more than five minutes, with\r\nMonsieur Laroche-Mathieu. Charles seemed worn out. He had grown much\r\nthinner during the past month, and coughed incessantly as he repeated:\r\n\"I must make up my mind to finish the winter in the south.\" Norbert de\r\nVarenne and Jacques Rival made their appearance together. Then a door\r\nhaving opened at the further end of the room, Monsieur Walter came in\r\nwith two tall young girls, of from sixteen to eighteen, one ugly and the\r\nother pretty.\r\n\r\nDuroy knew that the governor was the father of a family; but he was\r\nstruck with astonishment. He had never thought of his daughters, save as\r\none thinks of distant countries which one will never see. And then he\r\nhad fancied them quite young, and here they were grown-up women. They\r\nheld out their hands to him after being introduced, and then went and\r\nsat down at a little table, without doubt reserved to them, at which\r\nthey began to turn over a number of reels of silk in a work-basket. They\r\nwere still awaiting someone, and all were silent with that sense of\r\noppression, preceding dinners, between people who do not find themselves\r\nin the same mental atmosphere after the different occupations of the\r\nday.\r\n\r\nDuroy having, for want of occupation, raised his eyes towards the wall,\r\nMonsieur Walter called to him from a distance, with an evident wish to\r\nshow off his property: \"Are you looking at my pictures? I will show them\r\nto you,\" and he took a lamp, so that the details might be distinguished.\r\n\r\n\"Here we have landscapes,\" said he.\r\n\r\nIn the center of the wall was a large canvas by Guillemet, a bit of the\r\nNormandy coast under a lowering sky. Below it a wood, by Harpignies, and\r\na plain in Algeria, by Guillemet, with a camel on the horizon, a tall\r\ncamel with long legs, like some strange monument. Monsieur Walter passed\r\non to the next wall, and announced in a grave tone, like a master of the\r\nceremonies: \"High Art.\" There were four: \"A Hospital Visit,\" by Gervex;\r\n\"A Harvester,\" by Bastien-Lepage; \"A Widow,\" by Bouguereau; and \"An\r\nExecution,\" by Jean Paul Laurens. The last work represented a Vendean\r\npriest shot against the wall of his church by a detachment of Blues. A\r\nsmile flitted across the governor's grave countenance as he indicated\r\nthe next wall. \"Here the fanciful school.\" First came a little canvas by\r\nJean Beraud, entitled, \"Above and Below.\" It was a pretty Parisian\r\nmounting to the roof of a tramcar in motion. Her head appeared on a\r\nlevel with the top, and the gentlemen on the seats viewed with\r\nsatisfaction the pretty face approaching them, while those standing on\r\nthe platform below considered the young woman's legs with a different\r\nexpression of envy and desire. Monsieur Walter held the lamp at arm's\r\nlength, and repeated, with a sly laugh: \"It is funny, isn't it?\" Then he\r\nlit up \"A Rescue,\" by Lambert. In the middle of a table a kitten,\r\nsquatted on its haunches, was watching with astonishment and perplexity\r\na fly drowning in a glass of water. It had its paw raised ready to fish\r\nout the insect with a rapid sweep of it. But it had not quite made up\r\nits mind. It hesitated. What would it do? Then the governor showed a\r\nDetaille, \"The Lesson,\" which represented a soldier in a barrack-room\r\nteaching a poodle to play the drum, and said: \"That is very witty.\"\r\n\r\nDuroy laughed a laugh of approbation, and exclaimed: \"It is charming,\r\ncharm--\" He stopped short on hearing behind him the voice of Madame de\r\nMarelle, who had just come in.\r\n\r\nThe governor continued to light up the pictures as he explained them. He\r\nnow showed a water-color by Maurice Leloir, \"The Obstacle.\" It was a\r\nsedan chair checked on its way, the street being blocked by a fight\r\nbetween two laborers, two fellows struggling like Hercules. From out of\r\nthe window of the chair peered the head of a charming woman, who watched\r\nwithout impatience, without alarm, and with a certain admiration, the\r\ncombat of these two brutes. Monsieur Walter continued: \"I have others in\r\nthe adjoining rooms, but they are by less known men. I buy of the young\r\nartists now, the very young ones, and hang their works in the more\r\n\r\nprivate rooms until they become known.\" He then went on in a low tone:\r\n\"Now is the time to buy! The painters are all dying of hunger! They have\r\nnot a sou, not a sou!\"\r\n\r\nBut Duroy saw nothing, and heard without understanding. Madame de\r\nMarelle was there behind him. What ought he to do? If he spoke to her,\r\nmight she not turn her back on him, or treat him with insolence? If he\r\ndid not approach her, what would people think? He said to himself: \"I\r\nwill gain time, at any rate.\" He was so moved that for a moment he\r\nthought of feigning a sudden illness, which would allow him to withdraw.\r\nThe examination of the walls was over. The governor went to put down his\r\nlamp and welcome the last comer, while Duroy began to re-examine the\r\npictures as if he could not tire of admiring them. He was quite upset.\r\nWhat should he do? Madame Forestier called to him: \"Monsieur Duroy.\" He\r\nwent to her. It was to speak to him of a friend of hers who was about\r\nto give a fete, and who would like to have a line to that effect in the\r\n_Vie Francaise_. He gasped out: \"Certainly, Madame, certainly.\"\r\n\r\nMadame de Marelle was now quite close to him. He dared not turn round to\r\ngo away. All at once he thought he was going mad; she had said aloud:\r\n\"Good evening, Pretty-boy. So you no longer recognize me.\"\r\n\r\nHe rapidly turned on his heels. She stood before him smiling, her eyes\r\nbeaming with sprightliness and affection, and held out her hand. He took\r\nit tremblingly, still fearing some trick, some perfidy. She added,\r\ncalmly: \"What has become of you? One no longer sees anything of you.\"\r\n\r\nHe stammered, without being able to recover his coolness: \"I have a\r\ngreat deal to do, Madame, a great deal to do. Monsieur Walter has\r\nentrusted me with new duties which give me a great deal of occupation.\"\r\n\r\nShe replied, still looking him in the face, but without his being able\r\nto discover anything save good will in her glance: \"I know it. But that\r\nis no reason for forgetting your friends.\"\r\n\r\nThey were separated by a lady who came in, with red arms and red face, a\r\nstout lady in a very low dress, got up with pretentiousness, and walking\r\nso heavily that one guessed by her motions the size and weight of her\r\nlegs. As she seemed to be treated with great attention, Duroy asked\r\nMadame Forestier: \"Who is that lady?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Viscomtesse de Percemur, who signs her articles 'Lily Fingers.'\"\r\n\r\nHe was astounded, and seized on by an inclination to laugh.\r\n\r\n\"'Lily Fingers!' 'Lily Fingers!' and I imagined her young like\r\nyourself. So that is 'Lily Fingers.' That is very funny, very funny.\"\r\n\r\nA servant appeared in the doorway and announced dinner. The dinner was\r\ncommonplace and lively, one of those dinners at which people talk about\r\neverything, without saying anything. Duroy found himself between the\r\nelder daughter of the master of the house, the ugly one, Mademoiselle\r\nRose and Madame de Marelle. The neighborhood of the latter made him feel\r\nvery ill at ease, although she seemed very much at her ease, and chatted\r\nwith her usual vivacity. He was troubled at first, constrained,\r\nhesitating, like a musician who has lost the keynote. By degrees,\r\nhowever, he recovered his assurance, and their eyes continually meeting\r\nquestioned one another, exchanging looks in an intimate, almost sensual,\r\nfashion as of old. All at once he thought he felt something brush\r\nagainst his foot under the table. He softly pushed forward his leg and\r\nencountered that of his neighbor, which did not shrink from the contact.\r\nThey did not speak, each being at that moment turned towards their\r\nneighbor. Duroy, his heart beating, pushed a little harder with his\r\nknee. A slight pressure replied to him. Then he understood that their\r\nloves were beginning anew. What did they say then? Not much, but their\r\nlips quivered every time that they looked at one another.\r\n\r\nThe young fellow, however, wishing to do the amiable to his employer's\r\ndaughter, spoke to her from time to time. She replied as the mother\r\nwould have done, never hesitating as to what she should say. On the\r\nright of Monsieur Walter the Viscomtesse de Percemur gave herself the\r\nairs of a princess, and Duroy, amused at watching her, said in a low\r\nvoice to Madame de Marelle. \"Do you know the other, the one who signs\r\nherself 'Pink Domino'?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, very well, the Baroness de Livar.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is she of the same breed?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, but quite as funny. A tall, dried-up woman of sixty, false curls,\r\nprojecting teeth, ideas dating from the Restoration, and toilets of the\r\nsame epoch.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where did they unearth these literary phenomena?\"\r\n\r\n\"The scattered waifs of the nobility are always sheltered by enriched\r\ncits.\"\r\n\r\n\"No other reason?\"\r\n\r\n\"None.\"\r\n\r\nThen a political discussion began between the master of the house, the\r\ntwo deputies, Norbert de Varenne, and Jacques Rival, and lasted till\r\ndessert.\r\n\r\nWhen they returned to the drawing-room, Duroy again approached Madame de\r\nMarelle, and looking her in the eyes, said: \"Shall I see you home\r\nto-night?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because Monsieur Laroche Mathieu, who is my neighbor, drops me at my\r\ndoor every time I dine here.\"\r\n\r\n\"When shall I see you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Come and lunch with me to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nAnd they separated without saying anything more.\r\n\r\nDuroy did not remain late, finding the evening dull. As he went\r\ndownstairs he overtook Norbert de Varenne, who was also leaving. The old\r\npoet took him by the arm. No longer having to fear any rivalry as\r\nregards the paper, their work being essentially different, he now\r\nmanifested a fatherly kindness towards the young fellow.\r\n\r\n\"Well, will you walk home a bit of my way with me?\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"With pleasure, my dear master,\" replied Duroy.\r\n\r\nAnd they went out, walking slowly along the Boulevard Malesherbes. Paris\r\nwas almost deserted that night--a cold night--one of those nights that\r\nseem vaster, as it were, than others, when the stars seem higher above,\r\nand the air seems to bear on its icy breath something coming from\r\nfurther than even the stars. The two men did not speak at first. Then\r\nDuroy, in order to say something, remarked: \"Monsieur Laroche Mathieu\r\nseems very intelligent and well informed.\"\r\n\r\nThe old poet murmured: \"Do you think so?\"\r\n\r\nThe young fellow, surprised at this remark, hesitated in replying: \"Yes;\r\nbesides, he passes for one of the most capable men in the Chamber.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is possible. In the kingdom of the blind the one-eyed man is king.\r\nAll these people are commonplace because their mind is shut in between\r\ntwo walls, money and politics. They are dullards, my dear fellow, with\r\nwhom it is impossible to talk about anything we care for. Their minds\r\nare at the bottom mud, or rather sewage; like the Seine Asnieres. Ah!\r\nhow difficult it is to find a man with breadth of thought, one who\r\ncauses you the same sensation as the breeze from across the broad ocean\r\none breathes on the seashore. I have known some such; they are dead.\"\r\n\r\nNorbert de Varenne spoke with a clear but restrained voice, which would\r\nhave rung out in the silence of the night had he given it rein. He\r\nseemed excited and sad, and went on: \"What matter, besides, a little\r\n\r\nmore or less talent, since all must come to an end.\"\r\n\r\nHe was silent, and Duroy, who felt light hearted that evening, said with\r\na smile: \"You are gloomy to-day, dear master.\"\r\n\r\nThe poet replied: \"I am always so, my lad, so will you be in a few\r\nyears. Life is a hill. As long as one is climbing up one looks towards\r\nthe summit and is happy, but when one reaches the top one suddenly\r\nperceives the descent before one, and its bottom, which is death. One\r\nclimbs up slowly, but one goes down quickly. At your age a man is happy.\r\nHe hopes for many things, which, by the way, never come to pass. At\r\nmine, one no longer expects anything--but death.\"\r\n\r\nDuroy began to laugh: \"You make me shudder all over.\"\r\n\r\nNorbert de Varenne went on: \"No, you do not understand me now, but later\r\non you will remember what I am saying to you at this moment. A day\r\ncomes, and it comes early for many, when there is an end to mirth, for\r\nbehind everything one looks at one sees death. You do not even\r\nunderstand the word. At your age it means nothing; at mine it is\r\nterrible. Yes, one understands it all at once, one does not know how or\r\nwhy, and then everything in life changes its aspect. For fifteen years I\r\nhave felt death assail me as if I bore within me some gnawing beast. I\r\nhave felt myself decaying little by little, month by month, hour by\r\nhour, like a house crumbling to ruin. Death has disfigured me so\r\ncompletely that I do not recognize myself. I have no longer anything\r\nabout me of myself--of the fresh, strong man I was at thirty. I have\r\nseen death whiten my black hairs, and with what skillful and spiteful\r\nslowness. Death has taken my firm skin, my muscles, my teeth, my whole\r\nbody of old, only leaving me a despairing soul, soon to be taken too.\r\nEvery step brings me nearer to death, every moment, every breath hastens\r\nhis odious work. To breathe, sleep, drink, eat, work, dream, everything\r\nwe do is to die. To live, in short, is to die. I now see death so near\r\nthat I often want to stretch my arms to push it back. I see it\r\neverywhere. The insects crushed on the path, the falling leaves, the\r\nwhite hair in a friend's head, rend my heart and cry to me, \"Behold it!\"\r\nIt spoils for me all I do, all I see, all that I eat and drink, all that\r\nI love; the bright moonlight, the sunrise, the broad ocean, the noble\r\nrivers, and the soft summer evening air so sweet to breathe.\"\r\n\r\nHe walked on slowly, dreaming aloud, almost forgetting that he had a\r\nlistener: \"And no one ever returns--never. The model of a statue may be\r\npreserved, but my body, my face, my thoughts, my desires will never\r\nreappear again. And yet millions of beings will be born with a nose,\r\neyes, forehead, cheeks, and mouth like me, and also a soul like me,\r\nwithout my ever returning, without even anything recognizable of me\r\nappearing in these countless different beings. What can we cling to?\r\nWhat can we believe in? All religions are stupid, with their puerile\r\nmorality and their egoistical promises, monstrously absurd. Death alone\r\nis certain.\"\r\n\r\nHe stopped, reflected for a few moments, and then, with a look of\r\nresignation, said: \"I am a lost creature. I have neither father nor\r\nmother, nor sister nor brother; no wife, no children, no God.\"\r\n\r\nHe added, after a pause: \"I have only verse.\"\r\n\r\nThey reached the Pont de la Concorde, crossed it in silence, and walked\r\npast the Palais Bourbon. Norbert de Varenne began to speak again,\r\nsaying: \"Marry, my friend; you do not know what it is to live alone at\r\nmy age. Solitude now fills me with horrible agony--solitude at home by\r\nthe fireside of a night. It is so profound, so sad; the silence of the\r\nroom in which one dwells alone. It is not alone silence about the body,\r\nbut silence about the soul; and when the furniture creaks I shudder to\r\nthe heart, for no sound but is unexpected in my gloomy dwelling.\" He was\r\nsilent again for a moment, and then added: \"When one is old it is well,\r\nall the same, to have children.\"\r\n\r\nThey had got half way down the Rue de Bourgoyne. The poet halted in\r\nfront of a tall house, rang the bell, shook Duroy by the hand, and said:\r\n\"Forget all this old man's doddering, youngster, and live as befits your\r\nage. Good-night.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he disappeared in the dark passage.\r\n\r\nDuroy resumed his route with a pain at his heart. It seemed to him as\r\nthough he had been shown a hole filled with bones, an unavoidable gulf\r\ninto which all must fall one day. He muttered: \"By Jove, it can't be\r\nvery lively in his place. I should not care for a front seat to see the\r\nprocession of his thoughts go by. The deuce, no.\"\r\n\r\nBut having paused to allow a perfumed lady, alighting from her carriage\r\nand entering her house, to pass before him, he drew in with eager breath\r\nthe scent of vervain and orris root floating in the air. His lungs and\r\nheart throbbed suddenly with hope and joy, and the recollection of\r\nMadame de Marelle, whom he was to see the next day, assailed him from\r\nhead to foot. All smiled on him, life welcomed him with kindness. How\r\nsweet was the realization of hopes!\r\n\r\nHe fell asleep, intoxicated with this idea, and rose early to take a\r\nstroll down the Avenue du Bois de Boulogne before keeping his\r\nappointment. The wind having changed, the weather had grown milder\r\nduring the night, and it was as warm and as sunny as in April. All the\r\nfrequenters of the Bois had sallied out that morning, yielding to the\r\nsummons of a bright, clear day. Duroy walked along slowly. He passed the\r\nArc de Triomphe, and went along the main avenue. He watched the people\r\non horseback, ladies and gentlemen, trotting and galloping, the rich\r\nfolk of the world, and scarcely envied them now. He knew them almost all\r\nby name--knew the amount of their fortune, and the secret history of\r\ntheir life, his duties having made him a kind of directory of the\r\ncelebrities and the scandals of Paris.\r\n\r\nLadies rode past, slender, and sharply outlined in the dark cloth of\r\ntheir habits, with that proud and unassailable air many women have on\r\nhorseback, and Duroy amused himself by murmuring the names, titles, and\r\nqualities of the lovers whom they had had, or who were attributed to\r\nthem. Sometimes, instead of saying \"Baron de Tanquelot,\" \"Prince de la\r\nTour-Enguerrand,\" he murmured \"Lesbian fashion, Louise Michot of the\r\nVaudeville, Rose Marquetin of the Opera.\"\r\n\r\nThe game greatly amused him, as if he had verified, beneath grave\r\noutward appearances, the deep, eternal infamy of mankind, and as if this\r\nhad excited, rejoiced, and consoled him. Then he said aloud: \"Set of\r\nhypocrites!\" and sought out with his eye the horsemen concerning whom\r\nthe worst tales were current. He saw many, suspected of cheating at\r\nplay, for whom their clubs were, at all events, their chief, their sole\r\nsource of livelihood, a suspicious one, at any rate. Others, very\r\ncelebrated, lived only, it was well known, on the income of their wives;\r\nothers, again, it was affirmed, on that of their mistresses. Many had\r\npaid their debts, an honorable action, without it ever being guessed\r\nwhence the money had come--a very equivocal mystery. He saw financiers\r\nwhose immense fortune had had its origin in a theft, and who were\r\nreceived everywhere, even in the most noble houses; then men so\r\nrespected that the lower middle-class took off their hats on their\r\npassage, but whose shameless speculations in connection with great\r\nnational enterprises were a mystery for none of those really acquainted\r\nwith the inner side of things. All had a haughty look, a proud lip, an\r\ninsolent eye. Duroy still laughed, repeating: \"A fine lot; a lot of\r\nblackguards, of sharpers.\"\r\n\r\nBut a pretty little open carriage passed, drawn by two white ponies with\r\nflowing manes and tails, and driven by a pretty fair girl, a well-known\r\ncourtesan, who had two grooms seated behind her. Duroy halted with a\r\ndesire to applaud this mushroom of love, who displayed so boldly at this\r\nplace and time set apart for aristocratic hypocrites the dashing luxury\r\nearned between her sheets. He felt, perhaps vaguely, that there was\r\nsomething in common between them--a tie of nature, that they were of the\r\nsame race, the same spirit, and that his success would be achieved by\r\ndaring steps of the same kind. He walked back more slowly, his heart\r\naglow with satisfaction, and arrived a little in advance of the time at\r\nthe door of his former mistress.\r\n\r\nShe received him with proffered lips, as though no rupture had taken\r\nplace, and she even forgot for a few moments the prudence that made her\r\nopposed to all caresses at her home. Then she said, as she kissed the\r\nends of his moustache: \"You don't know what a vexation has happened to\r\nme, darling? I was hoping for a nice honeymoon, and here is my husband\r\nhome for six weeks. He has obtained leave. But I won't remain six weeks\r\nwithout seeing you, especially after our little tiff, and this is how I\r\nhave arranged matters. You are to come and dine with us on Monday. I\r\nhave already spoken to him about you, and I will introduce you.\"\r\n\r\nDuroy hesitated, somewhat perplexed, never yet having found himself face\r\nto face with a man whose wife he had enjoyed. He was afraid lest\r\nsomething might betray him--a slight embarrassment, a look, no matter\r\nwhat. He stammered out: \"No, I would rather not make your husband's\r\nacquaintance.\"\r\n\r\nShe insisted, very much astonished, standing before him with wide open,\r\nwondering eyes. \"But why? What a funny thing. It happens every day. I\r\nshould not have thought you such a goose.\"\r\n\r\nHe was hurt, and said: \"Very well, I will come to dinner on Monday.\"\r\n\r\nShe went on: \"In order that it may seem more natural I will ask the\r\nForestiers, though I really do not like entertaining people at home.\"\r\n\r\nUntil Monday Duroy scarcely thought any more about the interview, but on\r\nmounting the stairs at Madame de Marelle's he felt strangely uneasy, not\r\nthat it was so repugnant to him to take her husband's hand, to drink his\r\nwine, and eat his bread, but because he felt afraid of something without\r\nknowing what. He was shown into the drawing-room and waited as usual.\r\nSoon the door of the inner room opened, and he saw a tall, white-bearded\r\nman, wearing the ribbon of the Legion of Honor, grave and correct, who\r\nadvanced towards him with punctilious politeness, saying: \"My wife has\r\noften spoken to me of you, sir, and I am delighted to make your\r\nacquaintance.\"\r\n\r\nDuroy stepped forward, seeking to impart to his face a look of\r\nexpressive cordiality, and grasped his host's hand with exaggerated\r\nenergy. Then, having sat down, he could find nothing to say.\r\n\r\nMonsieur de Marelle placed a log upon the fire, and inquired: \"Have you\r\nbeen long engaged in journalism?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only a few months.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! you have got on quickly?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, fairly so,\" and he began to chat at random, without thinking very\r\nmuch about what he was saying, talking of all the trifles customary\r\namong men who do not know one another. He was growing seasoned now, and\r\nthought the situation a very amusing one. He looked at Monsieur de\r\nMarelle's serious and respectable face, with a temptation to laugh, as\r\nhe thought: \"I have cuckolded you, old fellow, I have cuckolded you.\" A\r\nvicious, inward satisfaction stole over him--the satisfaction of a thief\r\nwho has been successful, and is not even suspected--a delicious, roguish\r\njoy. He suddenly longed to be the friend of this man, to win his\r\nconfidence, to get him to relate the secrets of his life.\r\n\r\nMadame de Marelle came in suddenly, and having taken them in with a\r\nsmiling and impenetrable glance, went toward Duroy, who dared not, in\r\nthe presence of her husband, kiss her hand as he always did. She was\r\ncalm, and light-hearted as a person accustomed to everything, finding\r\nthis meeting simple and natural in her frank and native trickery.\r\nLaurine appeared, and went and held up her forehead to George more\r\nquietly than usual, her father's presence intimidating her. Her mother\r\nsaid to her: \"Well, you don't call him Pretty-boy to-day.\" And the child\r\nblushed as if a serious indiscretion had been committed, a thing that\r\nought not to have been mentioned, revealed, an intimate and, so to say,\r\nguilty secret of her heart laid bare.\r\n\r\nWhen the Forestiers arrived, all were alarmed at the condition of\r\nCharles. He had grown frightfully thin and pale within a week, and\r\ncoughed incessantly. He stated, besides, that he was leaving for Cannes\r\non the following Thursday, by the doctor's imperative orders. They left\r\nearly, and Duroy said, shaking his head: \"I think he is very bad. He\r\nwill never make old bones.\"\r\n\r\nMadame de Marelle said, calmly: \"Oh! he is done for. There is a man who\r\nwas lucky in finding the wife he did.\"\r\n\r\nDuroy asked: \"Does she help him much?\"\r\n\r\n\"She does everything. She is acquainted with everything that is going\r\non; she knows everyone without seeming to go and see anybody; she\r\nobtains what she wants as she likes. Oh! she is keen, clever, and\r\nintriguing as no one else is. She is a treasure for anyone wanting to\r\nget on.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge said: \"She will marry again very quickly, no doubt?\"\r\n\r\nMadame de Marelle replied: \"Yes. I should not be surprised if she had\r\nsome one already in her eye--a deputy, unless, indeed, he\r\nobjects--for--for--there may be serious--moral--obstacles. But then--I\r\ndon't really know.\"\r\n\r\nMonsieur de Marelle grumbled with slow impatience: \"You are always\r\nsuspecting a number of things that I do not like. Do not let us meddle\r\nwith the affairs of others. Our conscience is enough to guide us. That\r\nshould be a rule with everyone.\"\r\n\r\nDuroy withdrew, uneasy at heart, and with his mind full of vague plans.\r\nThe next day he paid a visit to the Forestiers, and found them finishing\r\ntheir packing up. Charles, stretched on a sofa, exaggerated his\r\ndifficulty of breathing, and repeated: \"I ought to have been off a month\r\nago.\"\r\n\r\nThen he gave George a series of recommendations concerning the paper,\r\nalthough everything had been agreed upon and settled with Monsieur\r\nWalter. As George left, he energetically squeezed his old comrade's\r\nhand, saying: \"Well, old fellow, we shall have you back soon.\" But as\r\nMadame Forestier was showing him out, he said to her, quickly: \"You have\r\nnot forgotten our agreement? We are friends and allies, are we not? So\r\nif you have need of me, for no matter what, do not hesitate. Send a\r\nletter or a telegram, and I will obey.\"\r\n\r\nShe murmured: \"Thanks, I will not forget.\" And her eye, too, said\r\n\"Thanks,\" in a deeper and tenderer fashion.\r\n\r\nAs Duroy went downstairs, he met slowly coming up Monsieur de Vaudrec,\r\nwhom he had met there once before. The Count appeared sad, at this\r\ndeparture, perhaps. Wishing to show his good breeding, the journalist\r\neagerly bowed. The other returned the salutation courteously, but in a\r\nsomewhat dignified manner.\r\n\r\nThe Forestiers left on Thursday evening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\n\r\nCharles's absence gave Duroy increased importance in the editorial\r\ndepartment of the _Vie Francaise_. He signed several leaders besides his\r\n\"Echoes,\" for the governor insisted on everyone assuming the\r\nresponsibility of his \"copy.\" He became engaged in several newspaper\r\ncontroversies, in which he acquitted himself creditably, and his\r\nconstant relations with different statesmen were gradually preparing him\r\nto become in his turn a clever and perspicuous political editor. There\r\nwas only one cloud on his horizon. It came from a little free-lance\r\nnewspaper, which continually assailed him, or rather in him assailed the\r\nchief writer of \"Echoes\" in the _Vie Francaise_, the chief of \"Monsieur\r\nWalter's startlers,\" as it was put by the anonymous writer of the\r\n_Plume_. Day by day cutting paragraphs, insinuations of every kind,\r\nappeared in it.\r\n\r\nOne day Jacques Rival said to Duroy: \"You are very patient.\"\r\n\r\nDuroy replied: \"What can I do, there is no direct attack?\"\r\n\r\nBut one afternoon, as he entered the editor's room, Boisrenard held out\r\nthe current number of the _Plume_, saying: \"Here's another spiteful dig\r\nat you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! what about?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! a mere nothing--the arrest of a Madame Aubert by the police.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge took the paper, and read, under the heading, \"Duroy's Latest\":\r\n\r\n\"The illustrious reporter of the _Vie Francaise_ to-day informs us that\r\nMadame Aubert, whose arrest by a police agent belonging to the odious\r\n_brigade des moeurs_ we announced, exists only in our imagination. Now\r\nthe person in question lives at 18 Rue de l'Ecureuil, Montmartre. We\r\nunderstand only too well, however, the interest the agents of Walter's\r\nbank have in supporting those of the Prefect of Police, who tolerates\r\ntheir commerce. As to the reporter of whom it is a question, he would do\r\nbetter to give us one of those good sensational bits of news of which he\r\nhas the secret--news of deaths contradicted the following day, news of\r\nbattles which have never taken place, announcements of important\r\nutterances by sovereigns who have not said anything--all the news, in\r\nshort, which constitutes Walter's profits, or even one of those little\r\nindiscretions concerning entertainments given by would-be fashionable\r\nladies, or the excellence of certain articles of consumption which are\r\nof such resource to some of our compeers.\"\r\n\r\nThe young fellow was more astonished than annoyed, only understanding\r\nthat there was something very disagreeable for him in all this.\r\n\r\nBoisrenard went on: \"Who gave you this 'Echo'?\"\r\n\r\nDuroy thought for a moment, having forgotten. Then all at once the\r\nrecollection occurred to him, \"Saint-Potin.\" He re-read the paragraph in\r\nthe _Plume_ and reddened, roused by the accusation of venality. He\r\nexclaimed: \"What! do they mean to assert that I am paid--\"\r\n\r\nBoisrenard interrupted him: \"They do, though. It is very annoying for\r\nyou. The governor is very strict about that sort of thing. It might\r\nhappen so often in the 'Echoes.'\"\r\n\r\nSaint-Potin came in at that moment. Duroy hastened to him. \"Have you\r\nseen the paragraph in the _Plume_?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and I have just come from Madame Aubert. She does exist, but she\r\nwas not arrested. That much of the report has no foundation.\"\r\n\r\nDuroy hastened to the room of the governor, whom he found somewhat cool,\r\nand with a look of suspicion in his eye. After having listened to the\r\nstatement of the case, Monsieur Walter said: \"Go and see the woman\r\nyourself, and contradict the paragraph in such terms as will put a stop\r\nto such things being written about you any more. I mean the latter part\r\nof the paragraph. It is very annoying for the paper, for yourself, and\r\nfor me. A journalist should no more be suspected than Caesar's wife.\"\r\n\r\nDuroy got into a cab, with Saint-Potin as his guide, and called out to\r\nthe driver: \"Number 18 Rue de l'Ecureuil, Montmartre.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a huge house, in which they had to go up six flights of stairs.\r\nAn old woman in a woolen jacket opened the door to them. \"What is it you\r\nwant with me now?\" said she, on catching sight of Saint-Potin.\r\n\r\nHe replied: \"I have brought this gentleman, who is an inspector of\r\npolice, and who would like to hear your story.\"\r\n\r\nThen she let him in, saying: \"Two more have been here since you, for\r\nsome paper or other, I don't know which,\" and turning towards Duroy,\r\nadded: \"So this gentleman wants to know about it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Were you arrested by an _agent des moeurs_?\"\r\n\r\nShe lifted her arms into the air. \"Never in my life, sir, never in my\r\nlife. This is what it is all about. I have a butcher who sells good\r\nmeat, but who gives bad weight. I have often noticed it without saying\r\nanything; but the other day, when I asked him for two pounds of chops,\r\nas I had my daughter and my son-in-law to dinner, I caught him weighing\r\nin bits of trimmings--trimmings of chops, it is true, but not of mine. I\r\ncould have made a stew of them, it is true, as well, but when I ask for\r\nchops it is not to get other people's trimmings. I refused to take them,\r\nand he calls me an old shark. I called him an old rogue, and from one\r\nthing to another we picked up such a row that there were over a hundred\r\npeople round the shop, some of them laughing fit to split. So that at\r\nlast a police agent came up and asked us to settle it before the\r\ncommissary. We went, and he dismissed the case. Since then I get my meat\r\nelsewhere, and don't even pass his door, in order to avoid his\r\nslanders.\"\r\n\r\nShe ceased talking, and Duroy asked: \"Is that all?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is the whole truth, sir,\" and having offered him a glass of cordial,\r\nwhich he declined, the old woman insisted on the short weight of the\r\nbutcher being spoken of in the report.\r\n\r\nOn his return to the office, Duroy wrote his reply:\r\n\r\n     \"An anonymous scribbler in the _Plume_ seeks to pick a quarrel\r\n     with me on the subject of an old woman whom he states was\r\n     arrested by an _agent des moeurs_, which fact I deny. I have\r\n     myself seen Madame Aubert--who is at least sixty years of\r\n     age--and she told me in detail her quarrel with the butcher\r\n     over the weighing of some chops, which led to an explanation\r\n     before the commissary of police. This is the whole truth. As to\r\n     the other insinuations of the writer in the _Plume_, I despise\r\n     them. Besides, a man does not reply to such things when they\r\n     are written under a mask.\r\n\r\n     \"GEORGE DUROY.\"\r\n\r\nMonsieur Walter and Jacques Rival, who had come in, thought this note\r\nsatisfactory, and it was settled that it should go in at once.\r\n\r\nDuroy went home early, somewhat agitated and slightly uneasy. What reply\r\nwould the other man make? Who was he? Why this brutal attack? With the\r\nbrusque manners of journalists this affair might go very far. He slept\r\nbadly. When he read his reply in the paper next morning, it seemed to\r\nhim more aggressive in print than in manuscript. He might, it seemed to\r\nhim, have softened certain phrases. He felt feverish all day, and slept\r\nbadly again at night. He rose at dawn to get the number of the _Plume_\r\nthat must contain a reply to him.\r\n\r\nThe weather had turned cold again, it was freezing hard. The gutters,\r\nfrozen while still flowing, showed like two ribbons of ice alongside the\r\npavement. The morning papers had not yet come in, and Duroy recalled the\r\nday of his first article, \"The Recollections of a Chasseur d'Afrique.\"\r\nHis hands and feet getting numbed, grew painful, especially the tips of\r\nhis fingers, and he began to trot round the glazed kiosque in which the\r\nnewspaper seller, squatting over her foot warmer, only showed through\r\nthe little window a red nose and a pair of cheeks to match in a woolen\r\nhood. At length the newspaper porter passed the expected parcel through\r\nthe opening, and the woman held out to Duroy an unfolded copy of the\r\n_Plume_.\r\n\r\nHe glanced through it in search of his name, and at first saw nothing.\r\nHe was breathing again, when he saw between two dashes:\r\n\r\n     \"Monsieur Duroy, of the _Vie Francaise_, contradicts us, and in\r\n     contradicting us, lies. He admits, however, that there is a\r\n     Madame Aubert, and that an agent took her before the commissary\r\n     of police. It only remains, therefore, to add two words, '_des\r\n     moeurs_,' after the word 'agent,' and he is right. But the\r\n     conscience of certain journalists is on a level with their\r\n     talent. And I sign,\r\n\r\n     \"LOUIS LANGREMONT.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge's heart began to beat violently, and he went home to dress\r\nwithout being too well aware of what he was doing. So he had been\r\ninsulted, and in such a way that no hesitation was possible. And why?\r\nFor nothing at all. On account of an old woman who had quarreled with\r\nher butcher.\r\n\r\nHe dressed quickly and went to see Monsieur Walter, although it was\r\nbarely eight o'clock. Monsieur Walter, already up, was reading the\r\n_Plume_. \"Well,\" said he, with a grave face, on seeing Duroy, \"you\r\ncannot draw back now.\" The young fellow did not answer, and the other\r\nwent on: \"Go at once and see Rival, who will act for you.\"\r\n\r\nDuroy stammered a few vague words, and went out in quest of the\r\ndescriptive writer, who was still asleep. He jumped out of bed, and,\r\nhaving read the paragraph, said: \"By Jove, you must go out. Whom do you\r\nthink of for the other second?\"\r\n\r\n\"I really don't know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Boisrenard? What do you think?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Boisrenard.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you a good swordsman?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"The devil! And with the pistol?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can shoot a little.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good. You shall practice while I look after everything else. Wait for\r\nme a moment.\"\r\n\r\nHe went into his dressing-room, and soon reappeared washed, shaved,\r\ncorrect-looking.\r\n\r\n\"Come with me,\" said he.\r\n\r\nHe lived on the ground floor of a small house, and he led Duroy to the\r\ncellar, an enormous cellar, converted into a fencing-room and shooting\r\ngallery, all the openings on the street being closed. After having lit a\r\nrow of gas jets running the whole length of a second cellar, at the\r\nend of which was an iron man painted red and blue; he placed on a\r\ntable two pairs of breech-loading pistols, and began to give the word\r\nof command in a sharp tone, as though on the ground: \"Ready?\r\nFire--one--two--three.\"\r\n\r\nDuroy, dumbfounded, obeyed, raising his arm, aiming and firing, and as\r\nhe often hit the mark fair on the body, having frequently made use of an\r\nold horse pistol of his father's when a boy, against the birds, Jacques\r\nRival, well satisfied, exclaimed: \"Good--very good--very good--you will\r\ndo--you will do.\"\r\n\r\nThen he left George, saying: \"Go on shooting till noon; here is plenty\r\nof ammunition, don't be afraid to use it. I will come back to take you\r\nto lunch and tell you how things are going.\"\r\n\r\nLeft to himself, Duroy fired a few more shots, and then sat down and\r\nbegan to reflect. How absurd these things were, all the same! What did a\r\nduel prove? Was a rascal less of a rascal after going out? What did an\r\nhonest man, who had been insulted, gain by risking his life against a\r\nscoundrel? And his mind, gloomily inclined, recalled the words of\r\nNorbert de Varenne.\r\n\r\nThen he felt thirsty, and having heard the sound of water dropping\r\nbehind him, found that there was a hydrant serving as a douche bath, and\r\ndrank from the nozzle of the hose. Then he began to think again. It was\r\ngloomy in this cellar, as gloomy as a tomb. The dull and distant rolling\r\nof vehicles sounded like the rumblings of a far-off storm. What o'clock\r\ncould it be? The hours passed by there as they must pass in prisons,\r\nwithout anything to indicate or mark them save the visits of the warder.\r\nHe waited a long time. Then all at once he heard footsteps and voices,\r\nand Jacques Rival reappeared, accompanied by Boisrenard. He called out\r\nas soon as he saw Duroy: \"It's all settled.\"\r\n\r\nThe latter thought the matter terminated by a letter of apology, his\r\nheart beat, and he stammered: \"Ah! thanks.\"\r\n\r\nThe descriptive writer continued: \"That fellow Langremont is very\r\nsquare; he accepted all our conditions. Twenty-five paces, one shot, at\r\nthe word of command raising the pistol. The hand is much steadier that\r\nway than bringing it down. See here, Boisrenard, what I told you.\"\r\n\r\nAnd taking a pistol he began to fire, pointed out how much better one\r\nkept the line by raising the arm. Then he said: \"Now let's go and lunch;\r\nit is past twelve o'clock.\"\r\n\r\nThey went to a neighboring restaurant. Duroy scarcely spoke. He ate in\r\norder not to appear afraid, and then, in course of the afternoon,\r\naccompanied Boisrenard to the office, where he got through his work in\r\nan abstracted and mechanical fashion. They thought him plucky. Jacques\r\nRival dropped in in the course of the afternoon, and it was settled that\r\nhis seconds should call for him in a landau at seven o'clock the next\r\nmorning, and drive to the Bois de Vesinet, where the meeting was to take\r\nplace. All this had been done so unexpectedly, without his taking part\r\nin it, without his saying a word, without his giving his opinion,\r\nwithout accepting or refusing, and with such rapidity, too, that he was\r\nbewildered, scared, and scarcely able to understand what was going on.\r\n\r\nHe found himself at home at nine o'clock, after having dined with\r\nBoisrenard, who, out of self-devotion, had not left him all day. As soon\r\nas he was alone he strode quickly up and down his room for several\r\nminutes. He was too uneasy to think about anything. One solitary idea\r\nfilled his mind, that of a duel on the morrow, without this idea\r\nawakening in him anything else save a powerful emotion. He had been a\r\nsoldier, he had been engaged with the Arabs, without much danger to\r\nhimself though, any more than when one hunts a wild boar.\r\n\r\nTo reckon things up, he had done his duty. He had shown himself what he\r\nshould be. He would be talked of, approved of, and congratulated. Then\r\nhe said aloud, as one does under powerful impressions: \"What a brute of\r\na fellow.\"\r\n\r\nHe sat down and began to reflect. He had thrown upon his little table\r\none of his adversary's cards, given him by Rival in order to retain his\r\naddress. He read, as he had already done a score of times during the\r\nday: \"Louis Langremont, 176 Rue Montmartre.\" Nothing more. He examined\r\nthese assembled letters, which seemed to him mysterious and full of some\r\ndisturbing import. Louis Langremont. Who was this man? What was his age,\r\nhis height, his appearance? Was it not disgusting that a stranger, an\r\nunknown, should thus come and suddenly disturb one's existence without\r\ncause and from sheer caprice, on account of an old woman who had had a\r\nquarrel with her butcher. He again repeated aloud: \"What a brute.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he stood lost in thought, his eyes fixed on the card. Anger was\r\naroused in him against this bit of paper, an anger with which was\r\nblended a strange sense of uneasiness. What a stupid business it was. He\r\ntook a pair of nail scissors which were lying about, and stuck their\r\npoints into the printed name, as though he was stabbing someone. So he\r\nwas to fight, and with pistols. Why had he not chosen swords? He would\r\nhave got off with a prick in the hand or arm, while with the pistols one\r\nnever knew the possible result. He said: \"Come, I must keep my pluck\r\nup.\"\r\n\r\nThe sound of his own voice made him shudder, and he glanced about him.\r\nHe began to feel very nervous. He drank a glass of water and went to\r\nbed.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he was in bed he blew out his candle and closed his eyes. He\r\nwas warm between the sheets, though it was very cold in his room, but\r\nhe could not manage to doze off. He turned over and over, remained five\r\nminutes on his back, then lay on his left side, then rolled on the\r\nright. He was still thirsty, and got up to drink. Then a sense of\r\nuneasiness assailed him. Was he going to be afraid? Why did his heart\r\nbeat wildly at each well-known sound in the room? When his clock was\r\ngoing to strike, the faint squeak of the lever made him jump, and he had\r\nto open his mouth for some moments in order to breathe, so oppressed did\r\nhe feel. He began to reason philosophically on the possibility of his\r\nbeing afraid.\r\n\r\nNo, certainly he would not be afraid, now he had made up his mind to go\r\nthrough with it to the end, since he was firmly decided to fight and not\r\nto tremble. But he felt so deeply moved that he asked himself: \"Can one\r\nbe afraid in spite of one's self?\" This doubt assailed him. If some\r\npower stronger than his will overcame it, what would happen? Yes, what\r\nwould happen? Certainly he would go on the ground, since he meant to.\r\nBut suppose he shook? suppose he fainted? And he thought of his\r\nposition, his reputation, his future.\r\n\r\nA strange need of getting up to look at himself in the glass suddenly\r\nseized him. He relit the candle. When he saw his face so reflected, he\r\nscarcely recognized himself, and it seemed to him that he had never seen\r\nhimself before. His eyes appeared enormous, and he was pale; yes, he was\r\ncertainly pale, very pale. Suddenly the thought shot through his mind:\r\n\"By this time to-morrow I may be dead.\" And his heart began to beat\r\nagain furiously. He turned towards his bed, and distinctly saw himself\r\nstretched on his back between the same sheets as he had just left. He\r\nhad the hollow cheeks of the dead, and the whiteness of those hands that\r\nno longer move. Then he grew afraid of his bed, and in order to see it\r\nno longer he opened the window to look out. An icy coldness assailed him\r\nfrom head to foot, and he drew back breathless.\r\n\r\nThe thought occurred to him to make a fire. He built it up slowly,\r\nwithout looking around. His hands shook slightly with a kind of nervous\r\ntremor when he touched anything. His head wandered, his disjointed,\r\ndrifting thoughts became fleeting and painful, an intoxication invaded\r\nhis mind as though he had been drinking. And he kept asking himself:\r\n\"What shall I do? What will become of me?\"\r\n\r\nHe began to walk up and down, repeating mechanically: \"I must pull\r\nmyself together. I must pull myself together.\" Then he added: \"I will\r\nwrite to my parents, in case of accident.\" He sat down again, took some\r\nnotepaper, and wrote: \"Dear papa, dear mamma.\" Then, thinking these\r\nwords rather too familiar under such tragic circumstances, he tore up\r\nthe first sheet, and began anew, \"My dear father, my dear mother, I am\r\nto fight a duel at daybreak, and as it might happen that--\" He did not\r\ndare write the rest, and sprang up with a jump. He was now crushed by\r\none besetting idea. He was going to fight a duel. He could no longer\r\navoid it. What was the matter with him, then? He meant to fight, his\r\nmind was firmly made up to do so, and yet it seemed to him that, despite\r\nevery effort of will, he could not retain strength enough to go to the\r\nplace appointed for the meeting. From time to time his teeth absolutely\r\nchattered, and he asked himself: \"Has my adversary been out before? Is\r\nhe a frequenter of the shooting galleries? Is he known and classed as a\r\nshot?\" He had never heard his name mentioned. And yet, if this man was\r\nnot a remarkably good pistol shot, he would scarcely have accepted that\r\ndangerous weapon without discussion or hesitation.\r\n\r\nThen Duroy pictured to himself their meeting, his own attitude, and the\r\nbearing of his opponent. He wearied himself in imagining the slightest\r\ndetails of the duel, and all at once saw in front of him the little\r\nround black hole in the barrel from which the ball was about to issue.\r\nHe was suddenly seized with a fit of terrible despair. His whole body\r\nquivered, shaken by short, sharp shudderings. He clenched his teeth to\r\navoid crying out, and was assailed by a wild desire to roll on the\r\nground, to tear something to pieces, to bite. But he caught sight of a\r\nglass on the mantelpiece, and remembered that there was in the cupboard\r\na bottle of brandy almost full, for he had kept up a military habit of a\r\nmorning dram. He seized the bottle and greedily drank from its mouth in\r\nlong gulps. He only put it down when his breath failed him. It was a\r\nthird empty. A warmth like that of flame soon kindled within his body,\r\nand spreading through his limbs, buoyed up his mind by deadening his\r\nthoughts. He said to himself: \"I have hit upon the right plan.\" And as\r\nhis skin now seemed burning he reopened the window.\r\n\r\n\r\nDay was breaking, calm and icy cold. On high the stars seemed dying away\r\nin the brightening sky, and in the deep cutting of the railway, the red,\r\ngreen, and white signal lamps were paling. The first locomotives were\r\nleaving the engine shed, and went off whistling, to be coupled to the\r\nfirst trains. Others, in the distance, gave vent to shrill and repeated\r\nscreeches, their awakening cries, like cocks of the country. Duroy\r\nthought: \"Perhaps I shall never see all this again.\" But as he felt that\r\nhe was going again to be moved by the prospect of his own fate, he\r\nfought against it strongly, saying: \"Come, I must not think of anything\r\ntill the moment of the meeting; it is the only way to keep up my pluck.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he set about his toilet. He had another moment of weakness while\r\nshaving, in thinking that it was perhaps the last time he should see his\r\nface. But he swallowed another mouthful of brandy, and finished\r\ndressing. The hour which followed was difficult to get through. He\r\nwalked up and down, trying to keep from thinking. When he heard a knock\r\nat the door he almost dropped, so violent was the shock to him. It was\r\nhis seconds. Already!\r\n\r\nThey were wrapped up in furs, and Rival, after shaking his principal's\r\nhand, said: \"It is as cold as Siberia.\" Then he added: \"Well, how goes\r\nit?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are quite steady?\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's it; we shall get on all right. Have you had something to eat and\r\ndrink?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; I don't need anything.\"\r\n\r\nBoisrenard, in honor of the occasion, sported a foreign order, yellow\r\nand green, that Duroy had never seen him display before.\r\n\r\nThey went downstairs. A gentleman was awaiting them in the carriage.\r\nRival introduced him as \"Doctor Le Brument.\" Duroy shook hands, saying,\r\n\"I am very much obliged to you,\" and sought to take his place on the\r\nfront seat. He sat down on something hard that made him spring up again,\r\nas though impelled by a spring. It was the pistol case.\r\n\r\nRival observed: \"No, the back seat for the doctor and the principal, the\r\nback seat.\"\r\n\r\nDuroy ended by understanding him, and sank down beside the doctor. The\r\ntwo seconds got in in their turn, and the driver started. He knew where\r\nto go. But the pistol case was in the way of everyone, above all of\r\nDuroy, who would have preferred it out of sight. They tried to put it at\r\nthe back of the seat and it hurt their own; they stuck it upright\r\nbetween Rival and Boisrenard, and it kept falling all the time. They\r\nfinished by stowing it away under their feet. Conversation languished,\r\nalthough the doctor related some anecdotes. Rival alone replied to him.\r\nDuroy would have liked to have given a proof of presence of mind, but he\r\nwas afraid of losing the thread of his ideas, of showing the troubled\r\nstate of his mind, and was haunted, too, by the disturbing fear of\r\nbeginning to tremble.\r\n\r\nThe carriage was soon right out in the country. It was about nine\r\no'clock. It was one of those sharp winter mornings when everything is as\r\nbright and brittle as glass. The trees, coated with hoar frost, seemed\r\nto have been sweating ice; the earth rang under a footstep, the dry air\r\ncarried the slightest sound to a distance, the blue sky seemed to shine\r\nlike a mirror, and the sun, dazzling and cold itself, shed upon the\r\nfrozen universe rays which did not warm anything.\r\n\r\nRival observed to Duroy: \"I got the pistols at Gastine Renette's. He\r\nloaded them himself. The box is sealed. We shall toss up, besides,\r\nwhether we use them or those of our adversary.\"\r\n\r\nDuroy mechanically replied: \"I am very much obliged to you.\"\r\n\r\nThen Rival gave him a series of circumstantial recommendations, for he\r\nwas anxious that his principal should not make any mistake. He\r\nemphasized each point several times, saying: \"When they say, 'Are you\r\nready, gentlemen?' you must answer 'Yes' in a loud tone. When they give\r\nthe word 'Fire!' you must raise your arm quickly, and you must fire\r\nbefore they have finished counting 'One, two, three.'\"\r\n\r\nAnd Duroy kept on repeating to himself: \"When they give the word to\r\nfire, I must raise my arm. When they give the word to fire, I must raise\r\nmy arm.\" He learnt it as children learn their lessons, by murmuring them\r\nto satiety in order to fix them on their minds. \"When they give the word\r\nto fire, I must raise my arm.\"\r\n\r\nThe carriage entered a wood, turned down an avenue on the right, and\r\nthen to the right again. Rival suddenly opened the door to cry to the\r\ndriver: \"That way, down the narrow road.\" The carriage turned into a\r\nrutty road between two copses, in which dead leaves fringed with ice\r\nwere quivering. Duroy was still murmuring: \"When they give the word to\r\nfire, I must raise my arm.\" And he thought how a carriage accident would\r\nsettle the whole affair. \"Oh! if they could only upset, what luck; if he\r\ncould only break a leg.\"\r\n\r\nBut he caught sight, at the further side of a clearing, of another\r\ncarriage drawn up, and four gentlemen stamping to keep their feet warm,\r\nand he was obliged to open his mouth, so difficult did his breathing\r\nbecome.\r\n\r\nThe seconds got out first, and then the doctor and the principal. Rival\r\nhad taken the pistol-case and walked away with Boisrenard to meet two of\r\nthe strangers who came towards them. Duroy watched them salute one\r\nanother ceremoniously, and then walk up and down the clearing, looking\r\nnow on the ground and now at the trees, as though they were looking for\r\nsomething that had fallen down or might fly away. Then they measured off\r\na certain number of paces, and with great difficulty stuck two walking\r\nsticks into the frozen ground. They then reassembled in a group and went\r\nthrough the action of tossing, like children playing heads or tails.\r\n\r\nDoctor Le Brument said to Duroy: \"Do you feel all right? Do you want\r\nanything?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, nothing, thanks.\"\r\n\r\nIt seemed to him that he was mad, that he was asleep, that he was\r\ndreaming, that supernatural influences enveloped him. Was he afraid?\r\nPerhaps. But he did not know. Everything about him had altered.\r\n\r\nJacques Rival returned, and announced in low tones of satisfaction: \"It\r\nis all ready. Luck has favored us as regards the pistols.\"\r\n\r\nThat, so far as Duroy was concerned, was a matter of profound\r\nindifference.\r\n\r\nThey took off his overcoat, which he let them do mechanically. They felt\r\nthe breast-pocket of his frock-coat to make certain that he had no\r\npocketbook or papers likely to deaden a ball. He kept repeating to\r\nhimself like a prayer: \"When the word is given to fire, I must raise my\r\narm.\"\r\n\r\nThey led him up to one of the sticks stuck in the ground and handed him\r\nhis pistol. Then he saw a man standing just in front of him--a short,\r\nstout, bald-headed man, wearing spectacles. It was his adversary. He saw\r\nhim very plainly, but he could only think: \"When the word to fire is\r\ngiven, I must raise my arm and fire at once.\"\r\n\r\nA voice rang out in the deep silence, a voice that seemed to come from a\r\ngreat distance, saying: \"Are you ready, gentlemen?\"\r\n\r\nGeorge exclaimed \"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nThe same voice gave the word \"Fire!\"\r\n\r\nHe heard nothing more, he saw nothing more, he took note of nothing\r\nmore, he only knew that he raised his arm, pressing strongly on the\r\ntrigger. And he heard nothing. But he saw all at once a little smoke at\r\nthe end of his pistol barrel, and as the man in front of him still stood\r\nin the same position, he perceived, too, a little cloud of smoke\r\ndrifting off over his head.\r\n\r\nThey had both fired. It was over.\r\n\r\nHis seconds and the doctor touched him, felt him and unbuttoned his\r\nclothes, asking, anxiously: \"Are you hit?\"\r\n\r\nHe replied at haphazard: \"No, I do not think so.\"\r\n\r\nLangremont, too, was as unhurt as his enemy, and Jacques Rival murmured\r\nin a discontented tone: \"It is always so with those damned pistols; you\r\neither miss or kill. What a filthy weapon.\"\r\n\r\nDuroy did not move, paralyzed by surprise and joy. It was over. They had\r\nto take away his weapon, which he still had clenched in his hand. It\r\nseemed to him now that he could have done battle with the whole world.\r\nIt was over. What happiness! He felt suddenly brave enough to defy no\r\nmatter whom.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the seconds conversed together for a few moments, making an\r\nappointment to draw up their report of the proceedings in the course of\r\nthe day. Then they got into the carriage again, and the driver, who was\r\nlaughing on the box, started off, cracking his whip. They breakfasted\r\ntogether on the boulevards, and in chatting over the event, Duroy\r\nnarrated his impressions. \"I felt quite unconcerned, quite. You must,\r\nbesides, have seen it yourself.\"\r\n\r\nRival replied: \"Yes, you bore yourself very well.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the report was drawn up it was handed to Duroy, who was to insert\r\nit in the paper. He was astonished to read that he had exchanged a\r\ncouple of shots with Monsieur Louis Langremont, and rather uneasily\r\ninterrogated Rival, saying: \"But we only fired once.\"\r\n\r\nThe other smiled. \"Yes, one shot apiece, that makes a couple of shots.\"\r\n\r\nDuroy, deeming the explanation satisfactory, did not persist. Daddy\r\nWalter embraced him, saying: \"Bravo, bravo, you have defended the colors\r\nof _Vie Francaise_; bravo!\"\r\n\r\nGeorge showed himself in the course of the evening at the principal\r\nnewspaper offices, and at the chief _cafes_ on the boulevards. He twice\r\nencountered his adversary, who was also showing himself. They did not\r\nbow to one another. If one of them had been wounded they would have\r\nshaken hands. Each of them, moreover, swore with conviction that he had\r\nheard the whistling of the other's bullet.\r\n\r\nThe next day, at about eleven, Duroy received a telegram. \"Awfully\r\nalarmed. Come at once. Rue de Constantinople.--Clo.\"\r\n\r\nHe hastened to their meeting-place, and she threw herself into his arms,\r\nsmothering him with kisses.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my darling! if you only knew what I felt when I saw the papers this\r\nmorning. Oh, tell me all about it! I want to know everything.\"\r\n\r\nHe had to give minute details. She said: \"What a dreadful night you must\r\nhave passed before the duel.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I slept very well.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should not have closed an eye. And on the ground--tell me all that\r\nhappened.\"\r\n\r\nHe gave a dramatic account. \"When we were face to face with one another\r\nat twenty paces, only four times the length of this room, Jacques, after\r\nasking if we were ready, gave the word 'Fire.' I raised my arm at once,\r\nkeeping a good line, but I made the mistake of trying to aim at the\r\nhead. I had a pistol with an unusually stiff pull, and I am accustomed\r\nto very easy ones, so that the resistance of the trigger caused me to\r\nfire too high. No matter, it could not have gone very far off him. He\r\nshoots well, too, the rascal. His bullet skimmed by my temple. I felt\r\nthe wind of it.\"\r\n\r\nShe was sitting on his knees, and holding him in her arms as though to\r\nshare his dangers. She murmured: \"Oh, my poor darling! my poor darling!\"\r\n\r\nWhen he had finished his narration, she said: \"Do you know, I cannot\r\nlive without you. I must see you, and with my husband in Paris it is not\r\neasy. Often I could find an hour in the morning before you were up to\r\nrun in and kiss you, but I won't enter that awful house of yours. What\r\nis to be done?\"\r\n\r\nHe suddenly had an inspiration, and asked: \"What is the rent here?\"\r\n\r\n\"A hundred francs a month.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I will take the rooms over on my own account, and live here\r\naltogether. Mine are no longer good enough for my new position.\"\r\n\r\nShe reflected a few moments, and then said: \"No, I won't have that.\"\r\n\r\nHe was astonished, and asked: \"Why not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I won't.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is not a reason. These rooms suit me very well. I am here, and\r\nshall remain here. Besides,\" he added, with a laugh, \"they are taken in\r\nmy name.\"\r\n\r\nBut she kept on refusing, \"No, no, I won't have it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not, then?\"\r\n\r\nThen she whispered tenderly: \"Because you would bring women here, and I\r\nwon't have it.\"\r\n\r\nHe grew indignant. \"Never. I can promise you that.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, you will bring them all the same.\"\r\n\r\n\"I swear I won't.\"\r\n\r\n\"Truly?\"\r\n\r\n\"Truly, on my word of honor. This is our place, our very own.\"\r\n\r\nShe clasped him to her in an outburst of love, exclaiming: \"Very well,\r\nthen, darling. But you know if you once deceive me, only once, it will\r\nbe all over between us, all over for ever.\"\r\n\r\nHe swore again with many protestations, and it was agreed that he should\r\ninstall himself there that very day, so that she could look in on him as\r\nshe passed the door. Then she said: \"In any case, come and dine with us\r\non Sunday. My husband thinks you are charming.\"\r\n\r\nHe was flattered \"Really!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you have captivated him. And then, listen, you have told me that\r\nyou were brought up in a country-house.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you must know something about agriculture?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, talk to him about gardening and the crops. He is very fond of\r\nthat sort of thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good; I will not forget.\"\r\n\r\nShe left him, after kissing him to an indefinite extent, the duel having\r\nstimulated her affection.\r\n\r\nDuroy thought, as he made his way to the office, \"What a strange being.\r\nWhat a feather brain. Can one tell what she wants and what she cares\r\nfor? And what a strange household. What fanciful being arranged the\r\nunion of that old man and this madcap? What made the inspector marry\r\nthis giddy girl? A mystery. Who knows? Love, perhaps.\" And he concluded:\r\n\"After all, she is a very nice little mistress, and I should be a very\r\nbig fool to let her slip away from me.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nHis duel had given Duroy a position among the leader-writers of the _Vie\r\nFrancaise_, but as he had great difficulty in finding ideas, he made a\r\nspecialty of declamatory articles on the decadence of morality, the\r\nlowering of the standard of character, the weakening of the patriotic\r\nfiber and the anemia of French honor. He had discovered the word anemia,\r\nand was very proud of it. And when Madame de Marelle, filled with that\r\nskeptical, mocking, and incredulous spirit characteristic of the\r\nParisian, laughed at his tirades, which she demolished with an epigram,\r\nhe replied with a smile: \"Bah! this sort of thing will give me a good\r\nreputation later on.\"\r\n\r\nHe now resided in the Rue de Constantinople, whither he had shifted his\r\nportmanteau, his hair-brush, his razor, and his soap, which was what his\r\nmoving amounted to. Twice or thrice a week she would call before he was\r\nup, undress in a twinkling, and slip into bed, shivering from the cold\r\nprevailing out of doors. As a set off, Duroy dined every Thursday at her\r\nresidence, and paid court to her husband by talking agriculture with\r\nhim. As he was himself fond of everything relating to the cultivation of\r\nthe soil, they sometimes both grew so interested in the subject of their\r\nconversation that they quite forgot the wife dozing on the sofa. Laurine\r\nwould also go to sleep, now on the knee of her father and now on that of\r\nPretty-boy. And when the journalist had left, Monsieur de Marelle never\r\nfailed to assert, in that doctrinal tone in which he said the least\r\nthing: \"That young fellow is really very pleasant company, he has a\r\nwell-informed mind.\"\r\n\r\nFebruary was drawing to a close. One began to smell the violets in the\r\nstreet, as one passed the barrows of the flower-sellers of a morning.\r\nDuroy was living beneath a sky without a cloud.\r\n\r\nOne night, on returning home, he found a letter that had been slipped\r\nunder his door. He glanced at the post-mark, and read \"Cannes.\" Having\r\nopened it, he read:\r\n\r\n     \"Villa Jolie, Cannes.\r\n\r\n     \"DEAR SIR AND FRIEND,--You told me, did you not, that I could\r\n     reckon upon you for anything? Well, I have a very painful\r\n     service to ask of you; it is to come and help me, so that I may\r\n     not be left alone during the last moments of Charles, who is\r\n     dying. He may not last out the week, as the doctor has\r\n     forewarned me, although he has not yet taken to his bed. I have\r\n     no longer strength nor courage to witness this hourly death,\r\n     and I think with terror of those last moments which are drawing\r\n     near. I can only ask such a service of you, as my husband has\r\n     no relatives. You were his comrade; he opened the door of the\r\n     paper to you. Come, I beg of you; I have no one else to ask.\r\n\r\n     \"Believe me, your very sincere friend,\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"MADELEINE FORESTIER.\"\r\n\r\nA strange feeling filled George's heart, a sense of freedom and of a\r\nspace opening before him, and he murmured: \"To be sure, I'll go. Poor\r\nCharles! What are we, after all?\"\r\n\r\nThe governor, to whom he read the letter, grumblingly granted\r\npermission, repeating: \"But be back soon, you are indispensable to us.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge left for Cannes next day by the seven o'clock express, after\r\nletting the Marelles know of his departure by a telegram. He arrived the\r\nfollowing evening about four o'clock. A commissionaire guided him to the\r\nVilla Jolie, built half-way up the slope of the pine forest clothed\r\nwith white houses, which extends from Cannes to the Golfe Juan. The\r\nhouse--small, low, and in the Italian style--was built beside the road\r\nwhich winds zig-zag fashion up through the trees, revealing a succession\r\nof charming views at every turning it makes.\r\n\r\nThe man servant opened the door, and exclaimed: \"Oh! Sir, madame is\r\nexpecting you most impatiently.\"\r\n\r\n\"How is your master?\" inquired Duroy.\r\n\r\n\"Not at all well, sir. He cannot last much longer.\"\r\n\r\nThe drawing-room, into which George was shown, was hung with pink and\r\nblue chintz. The tall and wide windows overlooked the town and the sea.\r\nDuroy muttered: \"By Jove, this is nice and swell for a country house.\r\nWhere the deuce do they get the money from?\"\r\n\r\nThe rustle of a dress made him turn round. Madame Forestier held out\r\nboth hands to him. \"How good of you to come, how good of you to come,\"\r\nsaid she.\r\n\r\nAnd suddenly she kissed him on the cheek. Then they looked at\r\none another. She was somewhat paler and thinner, but still\r\nfresh-complexioned, and perhaps still prettier for her additional\r\ndelicacy. She murmured: \"He is dreadful, do you know; he knows that he\r\n\r\nis doomed, and he leads me a fearful life. But where is your\r\nportmanteau?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have left it at the station, not knowing what hotel you would like me\r\nto stop at in order to be near you.\"\r\n\r\nShe hesitated a moment, and then said: \"You must stay here. Besides,\r\nyour room is all ready. He might die at any moment, and if it were to\r\nhappen during the night I should be alone. I will send for your\r\nluggage.\"\r\n\r\nHe bowed, saying: \"As you please.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now let us go upstairs,\" she said.\r\n\r\nHe followed her. She opened a door on the first floor, and Duroy saw,\r\nwrapped in rugs and seated in an armchair near the window, a kind of\r\nliving corpse, livid even under the red light of the setting sun, and\r\nlooking towards him. He scarcely recognized, but rather guessed, that it\r\nwas his friend. The room reeked of fever, medicated drinks, ether, tar,\r\nthe nameless and oppressive odor of a consumptive's sick room. Forestier\r\nheld out his hand slowly and with difficulty. \"So here you are; you have\r\ncome to see me die, then! Thanks.\"\r\n\r\nDuroy affected to laugh. \"To see you die? That would not be a very\r\namusing sight, and I should not select such an occasion to visit Cannes.\r\nI came to give you a look in, and to rest myself a bit.\"\r\n\r\nForestier murmured, \"Sit down,\" and then bent his head, as though lost\r\nin painful thoughts. He breathed hurriedly and pantingly, and from time\r\nto time gave a kind of groan, as if he wanted to remind the others how\r\nill he was.\r\n\r\nSeeing that he would not speak, his wife came and leaned against the\r\nwindow-sill, and indicating the view with a motion of her head, said,\r\n\"Look! Is not that beautiful?\"\r\n\r\nBefore them the hillside, dotted with villas, sloped downwards towards\r\nthe town, which stretched in a half-circle along the shore with its head\r\nto the right in the direction of the pier, overlooked by the old city\r\nsurmounted by its belfry, and its feet to the left towards the point of\r\nLa Croisette, facing the Isles of Lerins. These two islands appeared\r\nlike two green spots amidst the blue water. They seemed to be floating\r\non it like two huge green leaves, so low and flat did they appear from\r\nthis height. Afar off, bounding the view on the other side of the bay,\r\nbeyond the pier and the belfry, a long succession of blue hills showed\r\nup against a dazzling sky, their strange and picturesque line of summits\r\nnow rounded, now forked, now pointed, ending with a huge pyramidal\r\nmountain, its foot in the sea itself.\r\n\r\nMadame Forestier pointed it out, saying: \"This is L'Estherel.\"\r\n\r\nThe void beyond the dark hill tops was red, a glowing red that the eye\r\nwould not fear, and Duroy, despite himself, felt the majesty of the\r\nclose of the day. He murmured, finding no other term strong enough to\r\nexpress his admiration, \"It is stunning.\"\r\n\r\nForestier raised his head, and turning to his wife, said: \"Let me have\r\nsome fresh air.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pray, be careful,\" was her reply. \"It is late, and the sun is setting;\r\nyou will catch a fresh cold, and you know how bad that is for you.\"\r\n\r\nHe made a feverish and feeble movement with his right hand that was\r\nalmost meant for a blow, and murmured with a look of anger, the grin of\r\na dying man that showed all the thinness of his lips, the hollowness of\r\nthe cheeks, and the prominence of all the bones of the face: \"I tell you\r\nI am stifling. What does it matter to you whether I die a day sooner or\r\na day later, since I am done for?\"\r\n\r\nShe opened the window quite wide. The air that entered surprised all\r\nthree like a caress. It was a soft, warm breeze, a breeze of spring,\r\nalready laden with the scents of the odoriferous shrubs and flowers\r\nwhich sprang up along this shore. A powerful scent of turpentine and\r\nthe harsh savor of the eucalyptus could be distinguished.\r\n\r\nForestier drank it in with short and fevered gasps. He clutched the arm\r\nof his chair with his nails, and said in low, hissing, and savage tones:\r\n\"Shut the window. It hurts me; I would rather die in a cellar.\"\r\n\r\nHis wife slowly closed the window, and then looked out in space, her\r\nforehead against the pane. Duroy, feeling very ill at ease, would have\r\nliked to have chatted with the invalid and reassured him. But he could\r\nthink of nothing to comfort him. At length he said: \"Then you have not\r\ngot any better since you have been here?\"\r\n\r\nForestier shrugged his shoulders with low-spirited impatience. \"You see\r\nvery well I have not,\" he replied, and again lowered his head.\r\n\r\nDuroy went on: \"Hang it all, it is ever so much nicer here than in\r\nParis. We are still in the middle of winter there. It snows, it freezes,\r\nit rains, and it is dark enough for the lamps to be lit at three in the\r\nafternoon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Anything new at the paper?\" asked Forestier.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing. They have taken on young Lacrin, who has left the _Voltaire_,\r\nto do your work, but he is not up to it. It is time that you came back.\"\r\n\r\nThe invalid muttered: \"I--I shall do all my work six feet under the sod\r\nnow.\"\r\n\r\nThis fixed idea recurred like a knell _apropos_ of everything,\r\ncontinually cropping up in every idea, every sentence. There was a long\r\nsilence, a deep and painful silence. The glow of the sunset was slowly\r\nfading, and the mountains were growing black against the red sky, which\r\nwas getting duller. A colored shadow, a commencement of night, which yet\r\nretained the glow of an expiring furnace, stole into the room and seemed\r\nto tinge the furniture, the walls, the hangings, with mingled tints of\r\nsable and crimson. The chimney-glass, reflecting the horizon, seemed\r\nlike a patch of blood. Madame Forestier did not stir, but remained\r\nstanding with her back to the room, her face to the window pane.\r\n\r\nForestier began to speak in a broken, breathless voice, heartrending to\r\nlisten to. \"How many more sunsets shall I see? Eight, ten, fifteen, or\r\ntwenty, perhaps thirty--no more. You have time before you; for me it is\r\nall over. And it will go on all the same, after I am gone, as if I was\r\nstill here.\" He was silent for a few moments, and then continued: \"All\r\nthat I see reminds me that in a few days I shall see it no more. It is\r\nhorrible. I shall see nothing--nothing of all that exists; not the\r\nsmallest things one makes use of--the plates, the glasses, the beds in\r\nwhich one rests so comfortably, the carriages. How nice it is to drive\r\nout of an evening! How fond I was of all those things!\"\r\n\r\nHe nervously moved the fingers of both hands, as though playing the\r\npiano on the arms of his chair. Each of his silences was more painful\r\nthan his words, so evident was it that his thoughts must be fearful.\r\nDuroy suddenly recalled what Norbert de Varenne had said to him some\r\nweeks before, \"I now see death so near that I often want to stretch out\r\nmy arms to put it back. I see it everywhere. The insects crushed on the\r\npath, the falling leaves, the white hair in a friend's beard, rend my\r\nheart and cry to me, 'Behold!'\"\r\n\r\nHe had not understood all this on that occasion; now, seeing Forestier,\r\nhe did. An unknown pain assailed him, as if he himself was sensible of\r\nthe presence of death, hideous death, hard by, within reach of his hand,\r\non the chair in which his friend lay gasping. He longed to get up, to go\r\naway, to fly, to return to Paris at once. Oh! if he had known he would\r\nnot have come.\r\n\r\nDarkness had now spread over the room, like premature mourning for the\r\ndying man. The window alone remained still visible, showing, within the\r\nlighter square formed by it, the motionless outline of the young wife.\r\n\r\nForestier remarked, with irritation, \"Well, are they going to bring in\r\nthe lamp to-night? This is what they call looking after an invalid.\"\r\n\r\nThe shadow outlined against the window panes disappeared, and the sound\r\nof an electric bell rang through the house. A servant shortly entered\r\nand placed a lamp on the mantelpiece. Madame Forestier said to her\r\nhusband, \"Will you go to bed, or would you rather come down to dinner?\"\r\n\r\nHe murmured: \"I will come down.\"\r\n\r\nWaiting for this meal kept them all three sitting still for nearly an\r\nhour, only uttering from time to time some needless commonplace remark,\r\nas if there had been some danger, some mysterious danger in letting\r\nsilence endure too long, in letting the air congeal in this room where\r\ndeath was prowling.\r\n\r\nAt length dinner was announced. The meal seemed interminable to Duroy.\r\nThey did not speak, but ate noiselessly, and then crumbled their bread\r\nwith their fingers. The man servant who waited upon them went to and fro\r\nwithout the sound of his footsteps being heard, for as the creak of a\r\nboot-sole irritated Charles, he wore list slippers. The harsh tick of a\r\nwooden clock alone disturbed the calm with its mechanical and regular\r\nsound.\r\n\r\nAs soon as dinner was over Duroy, on the plea of fatigue, retired to his\r\nroom, and leaning on the window-sill watched the full moon, in the midst\r\nof the sky like an immense lamp, casting its cold gleam upon the white\r\nwalls of the villas, and scattering over the sea a soft and moving\r\ndappled light. He strove to find some reason to justify a swift\r\ndeparture, inventing plans, telegrams he was to receive, a recall from\r\nMonsieur Walter.\r\n\r\nBut his resolves to fly appeared more difficult to realize on awakening\r\nthe next morning. Madame Forestier would not be taken in by his devices,\r\nand he would lose by his cowardice all the benefit of his self-devotion.\r\nHe said to himself: \"Bah! it is awkward; well so much the worse, there\r\nmust be unpleasant situations in life, and, besides, it will perhaps be\r\nsoon over.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a bright day, one of those bright Southern days that make the\r\nheart feel light, and Duroy walked down to the sea, thinking that it\r\nwould be soon enough to see Forestier some time in course of the\r\nafternoon. When he returned to lunch, the servant remarked, \"Master has\r\nalready asked for you two or three times, sir. Will you please step up\r\nto his room, sir?\"\r\n\r\nHe went upstairs. Forestier appeared to be dozing in his armchair. His\r\nwife was reading, stretched out on the sofa.\r\n\r\nThe invalid raised his head, and Duroy said, \"Well, how do you feel? You\r\nseem quite fresh this morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I am better, I have recovered some of my strength. Get through\r\n\r\nyour lunch with Madeleine as soon as you can, for we are going out for\r\na drive.\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as she was alone with Duroy, the young wife said to him, \"There,\r\nto-day he thinks he is all right again. He has been making plans all the\r\nmorning. We are going to the Golfe Juan now to buy some pottery for our\r\nrooms in Paris. He is determined to go out, but I am horribly afraid of\r\nsome mishap. He cannot bear the shaking of the drive.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the landau arrived, Forestier came down stairs a step at a time,\r\nsupported by his servant. But as soon as he caught sight of the\r\ncarriage, he ordered the hood to be taken off. His wife opposed this,\r\nsaying, \"You will catch cold. It is madness.\"\r\n\r\nHe persisted, repeating, \"Oh, I am much better. I feel it.\"\r\n\r\nThey passed at first along some of those shady roads, bordered by\r\ngardens, which cause Cannes to resemble a kind of English Park, and then\r\nreached the highway to Antibes, running along the seashore. Forestier\r\nacted as guide. He had already pointed out the villa of the Court de\r\nParis, and now indicated others. He was lively, with the forced and\r\nfeeble gayety of a doomed man. He lifted his finger, no longer having\r\nstrength to stretch out his arm, and said, \"There is the Ile Sainte\r\nMarguerite, and the chateau from which Bazaine escaped. How they did\r\nhumbug us over that matter!\"\r\n\r\nThen regimental recollections recurred to him, and he mentioned various\r\nofficers whose names recalled incidents to them. But all at once, the\r\nroad making a turn, they caught sight of the whole of the Golfe Juan,\r\nwith the white village in the curve of the bay, and the point of Antibes\r\nat the further side of it. Forestier, suddenly seized upon by childish\r\nglee, exclaimed, \"Ah! the squadron, you will see the squadron.\"\r\n\r\nIndeed they could perceive, in the middle of the broad bay, half-a-dozen\r\nlarge ships resembling rocks covered with leafless trees. They were\r\nhuge, strange, mis-shapen, with excrescences, turrets, rams, burying\r\nthemselves in the water as though to take root beneath the waves. One\r\ncould scarcely imagine how they could stir or move about, they seemed so\r\nheavy and so firmly fixed to the bottom. A floating battery, circular\r\nand high out of water, resembling the light-houses that are built on\r\nshoals. A tall three-master passed near them, with all its white sails\r\nset. It looked graceful and pretty beside these iron war monsters\r\nsquatted on the water. Forestier tried to make them out. He pointed out\r\nthe Colbert, the Suffren, the Admiral Duperre, the Redoubtable, the\r\nDevastation, and then checking himself, added, \"No I made a mistake;\r\nthat one is the Devastation.\"\r\n\r\nThey arrived opposite a species of large pavilion, on the front of which\r\nwas the inscription, \"Art Pottery of the Golfe Juan,\" and the carriage,\r\ndriving up the sweep, stopped before the door. Forestier wanted to buy a\r\ncouple of vases for his study. As he felt unequal to getting out of the\r\ncarriage, specimens were brought out to him one after the other. He was\r\na long time in making a choice, and consulted his wife and Duroy.\r\n\r\n\"You know,\" he said, \"it is for the cabinet at the end of the study.\r\nSitting in my chair, I have it before my eyes all the time. I want an\r\nantique form, a Greek outline.\" He examined the specimens, had others\r\nbrought, and then turned again to the first ones. At length he made up\r\nhis mind, and having paid, insisted upon the articles being sent on at\r\nonce. \"I shall be going back to Paris in a few days,\" he said.\r\n\r\nThey drove home, but as they skirted the bay a rush of cold air from one\r\nof the valleys suddenly met them, and the invalid began to cough. It was\r\nnothing at first, but it augmented and became an unbroken fit of\r\ncoughing, and then a kind of gasping hiccough.\r\n\r\nForestier was choking, and every time he tried to draw breath the cough\r\nseemed to rend his chest. Nothing would soothe or check it. He had to be\r\nborne from the carriage to his room, and Duroy, who supported his legs,\r\nfelt the jerking of his feet at each convulsion of his lungs. The warmth\r\nof the bed did not check the attack, which lasted till midnight, when,\r\nat length, narcotics lulled its deadly spasm. The sick man remained till\r\nmorning sitting up in his bed, with his eyes open.\r\n\r\nThe first words he uttered were to ask for the barber, for he insisted\r\non being shaved every morning. He got up for this operation, but had to\r\nbe helped back into bed at once, and his breathing grew so short, so\r\nhard, and so difficult, that Madame Forestier, in alarm, had Duroy, who\r\nhad just turned in, roused up again in order to beg him to go for the\r\ndoctor.\r\n\r\nHe came back almost immediately with Dr. Gavaut, who prescribed a\r\nsoothing drink and gave some advice; but when the journalist saw him to\r\nthe door, in order to ask his real opinion, he said, \"It is the end. He\r\nwill be dead to-morrow morning. Break it to his poor wife, and send for\r\na priest. I, for my part, can do nothing more. I am, however, entirely\r\nat your service.\"\r\n\r\nDuroy sent for Madame Forestier. \"He is dying,\" said he. \"The doctor\r\nadvises a priest being sent for. What would you like done?\"\r\n\r\nShe hesitated for some time, and then, in slow tones, as though she had\r\ncalculated everything, replied, \"Yes, that will be best--in many\r\nrespects. I will break it to him--tell him the vicar wants to see him,\r\nor something or other; I really don't know what. You would be very kind\r\nif you would go and find a priest for me and pick one out. Choose one\r\nwho won't raise too many difficulties over the business. One who will be\r\nsatisfied with confession, and will let us off with the rest of it all.\"\r\n\r\nThe young fellow returned with a complaisant old ecclesiastic, who\r\naccommodated himself to the state of affairs. As soon as he had gone\r\ninto the dying man's room, Madame Forestier came out of it, and sat down\r\nwith Duroy in the one adjoining.\r\n\r\n\"It has quite upset him,\" said she. \"When I spoke to him about a priest\r\nhis face assumed a frightful expression as if he had felt the\r\nbreath--the breath of--you know. He understood that it was all over at\r\nlast, and that his hours were numbered.\" She was very pale as she\r\ncontinued, \"I shall never forget the expression of his face. He\r\ncertainly saw death face to face at that moment. He saw him.\"\r\n\r\nThey could hear the priest, who spoke in somewhat loud tones, being\r\nslightly deaf, and who was saying, \"No, no; you are not so bad as all\r\nthat. You are ill, but in no danger. And the proof is that I have called\r\nin as a friend as a neighbor.\"\r\n\r\nThey could not make out Forestier's reply, but the old man went on, \"No,\r\nI will not ask you to communicate. We will talk of that when you are\r\nbetter. If you wish to profit by my visit--to confess, for instance--I\r\nask nothing better. I am a shepherd, you know, and seize on every\r\noccasion to bring a lamb back to the fold.\"\r\n\r\nA long silence followed. Forestier must have been speaking in a faint\r\nvoice. Then all at once the priest uttered in a different tone, the tone\r\nof one officiating at the altar. \"The mercy of God is infinite. Repeat\r\nthe Comfiteor, my son. You have perhaps forgotten it; I will help you.\r\nRepeat after me: 'Comfiteor Deo omnipotenti--Beata Maria semper\r\nvirgini.'\"\r\n\r\nHe paused from time to time to allow the dying man to catch him up. Then\r\nhe said, \"And now confess.\"\r\n\r\nThe young wife and Duroy sat still seized on by a strange uneasiness,\r\nstirred by anxious expectation. The invalid had murmured something. The\r\npriest repeated, \"You have given way to guilty pleasures--of what kind,\r\nmy son?\"\r\n\r\nMadeleine rose and said, \"Let us go down into the garden for a short\r\ntime. We must not listen to his secrets.\"\r\n\r\nAnd they went and sat down on a bench before the door beneath a rose\r\ntree in bloom, and beside a bed of pinks, which shed their soft and\r\npowerful perfume abroad in the pure air. Duroy, after a few moments'\r\nsilence, inquired, \"Shall you be long before you return to Paris?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no,\" she replied. \"As soon as it is all over I shall go back\r\nthere.\"\r\n\r\n\"Within ten days?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, at the most.\"\r\n\r\n\"He has no relations, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"None except cousins. His father and mother died when he was quite\r\nyoung.\"\r\n\r\nThey both watched a butterfly sipping existence from the pinks, passing\r\nfrom one to another with a soft flutter of his wings, which continued to\r\nflap slowly when he alighted on a flower. They remained silent for a\r\nconsiderable time.\r\n\r\nThe servant came to inform them that \"the priest had finished,\" and they\r\nwent upstairs together.\r\n\r\nForestier seemed to have grown still thinner since the day before. The\r\npriest held out his hand to him, saying, \"Good-day, my son, I shall call\r\nin again to-morrow morning,\" and took his departure.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he had left the room the dying man, who was panting for\r\nbreath, strove to hold out his two hands to his wife, and gasped, \"Save\r\nme--save me, darling, I don't want to die--I don't want to die. Oh! save\r\nme--tell me what I had better do; send for the doctor. I will take\r\nwhatever you like. I won't die--I won't die.\"\r\n\r\nHe wept. Big tears streamed from his eyes down his fleshless cheeks, and\r\nthe corners of his mouth contracted like those of a vexed child. Then\r\nhis hands, falling back on the bed clothes, began a slow, regular, and\r\ncontinuous movement, as though trying to pick something off the sheet.\r\n\r\nHis wife, who began to cry too, said: \"No, no, it is nothing. It is only\r\na passing attack, you will be better to-morrow, you tired yourself too\r\nmuch going out yesterday.\"\r\n\r\nForestier's breathing was shorter than that of a dog who has been\r\nrunning, so quick that it could not be counted, so faint that it could\r\nscarcely be heard.\r\n\r\nHe kept repeating: \"I don't want to die. Oh! God--God--God; what is to\r\nbecome of me? I shall no longer see anything--anything any more. Oh!\r\nGod.\"\r\n\r\nHe saw before him some hideous thing invisible to the others, and his\r\nstaring eyes reflected the terror it inspired. His two hands continued\r\ntheir horrible and wearisome action. All at once he started with a sharp\r\nshudder that could be seen to thrill the whole of his body, and jerked\r\nout the words, \"The graveyard--I--Oh! God.\"\r\n\r\nHe said no more, but lay motionless, haggard and panting.\r\n\r\nTime sped on, noon struck by the clock of a neighboring convent. Duroy\r\nleft the room to eat a mouthful or two. He came back an hour later.\r\nMadame Forestier refused to take anything. The invalid had not stirred.\r\nHe still continued to draw his thin fingers along the sheet as though to\r\npull it up over his face.\r\n\r\nHis wife was seated in an armchair at the foot of the bed. Duroy took\r\nanother beside her, and they waited in silence. A nurse had come, sent\r\nin by the doctor, and was dozing near the window.\r\n\r\nDuroy himself was beginning to doze off when he felt that something was\r\nhappening. He opened his eyes just in time to see Forestier close his,\r\nlike two lights dying out. A faint rattle stirred in the throat of the\r\ndying man, and two streaks of blood appeared at the corners of his\r\nmouth, and then flowed down into his shirt. His hands ceased their\r\nhideous motion. He had ceased to breathe.\r\n\r\nHis wife understood this, and uttering a kind of shriek, she fell on her\r\nknees sobbing, with her face buried in the bed-clothes. George,\r\nsurprised and scared, mechanically made the sign of the cross. The nurse\r\nawakened, drew near the bed. \"It is all over,\" said she.\r\n\r\nDuroy, who was recovering his self-possession, murmured, with a sigh of\r\nrelief: \"It was sooner over than I thought for.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the first shock was over and the first tears shed, they had to busy\r\nthemselves with all the cares and all the necessary steps a dead man\r\nexacts. Duroy was running about till nightfall. He was very hungry when\r\nhe got back. Madame Forestier ate a little, and then they both installed\r\nthemselves in the chamber of death to watch the body. Two candles burned\r\non the night-table beside a plate filled with holy water, in which lay a\r\nsprig of mimosa, for they had not been able to get the necessary twig of\r\nconsecrated box.\r\n\r\nThey were alone, the young man and the young wife, beside him who was no\r\nmore. They sat without speaking, thinking and watching.\r\n\r\nGeorge, whom the darkness rendered uneasy in presence of the corpse,\r\nkept his eyes on this persistently. His eye and his mind were both\r\nattracted and fascinated by this fleshless visage, which the vacillating\r\nlight caused to appear yet more hollow. That was his friend Charles\r\nForestier, who was chatting with him only the day before! What a strange\r\nand fearful thing was this end of a human being! Oh! how he recalled the\r\nwords of Norbert de Varenne haunted by the fear of death: \"No one ever\r\ncomes back.\" Millions on millions would be born almost identical, with\r\neyes, a nose, a mouth, a skull and a mind within it, without he who lay\r\nthere on the bed ever reappearing again.\r\n\r\nFor some years he had lived, eaten, laughed, loved, hoped like all the\r\nworld. And it was all over for him all over for ever. Life; a few days,\r\nand then nothing. One is born, one grows up, one is happy, one waits,\r\nand then one dies. Farewell, man or woman, you will not return again to\r\nearth. Plants, beast, men, stars, worlds, all spring to life, and then\r\ndie to be transformed anew. But never one of them comes back--insect,\r\nman, nor planet.\r\n\r\nA huge, confused, and crushing sense of terror weighed down the soul of\r\nDuroy, the terror of that boundless and inevitable annihilation\r\ndestroying all existence. He already bowed his head before its menace.\r\nHe thought of the flies who live a few hours, the beasts who live a few\r\ndays, the men who live a few years, the worlds which live a few\r\ncenturies. What was the difference between one and the other? A few more\r\ndays' dawn that was all.\r\n\r\nHe turned away his eyes in order no longer to have the corpse before\r\nthem. Madame Forestier, with bent head, seemed also absorbed in painful\r\nthoughts. Her fair hair showed so prettily with her pale face, that a\r\nfeeling, sweet as the touch of hope flitted through the young fellow's\r\nbreast. Why grieve when he had still so many years before him? And he\r\nbegan to observe her. Lost in thought she did not notice him. He said to\r\nhimself, \"That, though, is the only good thing in life, to love, to hold\r\nthe woman one loves in one's arms. That is the limit of human\r\nhappiness.\"\r\n\r\nWhat luck the dead man had had to meet such an intelligent and charming\r\ncompanion! How had they become acquainted? How ever had she agreed on\r\nher part to marry that poor and commonplace young fellow? How had she\r\nsucceeded in making someone of him? Then he thought of all the hidden\r\nmysteries of people's lives. He remembered what had been whispered about\r\nthe Count de Vaudrec, who had dowered and married her off it was said.\r\n\r\nWhat would she do now? Whom would she marry? A deputy, as Madame de\r\nMarelle fancied, or some young fellow with a future before him, a higher\r\nclass Forestier? Had she any projects, any plans, any settled ideas? How\r\nhe would have liked to know that. But why this anxiety as to what she\r\nwould do? He asked himself this, and perceived that his uneasiness was\r\ndue to one of those half-formed and secret ideas which one hides from\r\neven one's self, and only discovers when fathoming one's self to the\r\nvery bottom.\r\n\r\nYes, why should he not attempt this conquest himself? How strong and\r\nredoubtable he would be with her beside him!\r\n\r\nHow quick, and far, and surely he would fly! And why should he not\r\nsucceed too? He felt that he pleased her, that she had for him more than\r\nmere sympathy; in fact, one of those affections which spring up between\r\ntwo kindred spirits and which partake as much of silent seduction as of\r\na species of mute complicity. She knew him to be intelligent, resolute,\r\nand tenacious, she would have confidence in him.\r\n\r\nHad she not sent for him under the present grave circumstances? And why\r\nhad she summoned him? Ought he not to see in this a kind of choice, a\r\nspecies of confession. If she had thought of him just at the moment she\r\nwas about to become a widow, it was perhaps that she had thought of one\r\nwho was again to become her companion and ally? An impatient desire to\r\nknow this, to question her, to learn her intentions, assailed him. He\r\nwould have to leave on the next day but one, as he could not remain\r\nalone with her in the house. So it was necessary to be quick, it was\r\nnecessary before returning to Paris to become acquainted, cleverly and\r\ndelicately, with her projects, and not to allow her to go back on them,\r\nto yield perhaps to the solicitations of another, and pledge herself\r\nirrevocably.\r\n\r\nThe silence in the room was intense, nothing was audible save the\r\nregular and metallic tick of the pendulum of the clock on the\r\nmantelpiece.\r\n\r\nHe murmured: \"You must be very tired?\"\r\n\r\nShe replied: \"Yes; but I am, above all, overwhelmed.\"\r\n\r\nThe sound of their own voices startled them, ringing strangely in this\r\ngloomy room, and they suddenly glanced at the dead man's face as though\r\nthey expected to see it move on hearing them, as it had done some hours\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nDuroy resumed: \"Oh! it is a heavy blow for you, and such a complete\r\nchange in your existence, a shock to your heart and your whole life.\"\r\n\r\nShe gave a long sigh, without replying, and he continued, \"It is so\r\npainful for a young woman to find herself alone as you will be.\"\r\n\r\nHe paused, but she said nothing, and he again went on, \"At all events,\r\nyou know the compact entered into between us. You can make what use of\r\nme you will. I belong to you.\"\r\n\r\nShe held out her hand, giving him at the same time one of those sweet,\r\nsad looks which stir us to the very marrow.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, you are very kind,\" she said. \"If I dared, and if I could do\r\nanything for you, I, too, should say, 'You may count upon me.'\"\r\n\r\nHe had taken the proffered hand and kept it clasped in his, with a\r\nburning desire to kiss it. He made up his mind to this at last, and\r\nslowly raising it to his mouth, held the delicate skin, warm, slightly\r\nfeverish and perfumed, to his lips for some time. Then, when he felt\r\nthat his friendly caress was on the point of becoming too prolonged, he\r\nlet fall the little hand. It sank back gently onto the knee of its\r\nmistress, who said, gravely: \"Yes, I shall be very lonely, but I shall\r\nstrive to be brave.\"\r\n\r\nHe did not know how to give her to understand that he would be happy,\r\nvery happy, to have her for his wife in his turn. Certainly he could not\r\ntell her so at that hour, in that place, before that corpse; yet he\r\nmight, it seemed to him, hit upon one of those ambiguous, decorous, and\r\ncomplicated phrases which have a hidden meaning under their words, and\r\nwhich express all one wants to by their studied reticence. But the\r\ncorpse incommoded him, the stiffened corpse stretched out before them,\r\nand which he felt between them. For some time past, too, he fancied he\r\ndetected in the close atmosphere of the room a suspicious odor, a\r\nfoetid breath exhaling from the decomposing chest, the first whiff of\r\ncarrion which the dead lying on their bed throw out to the relatives\r\nwatching them, and with which they soon fill the hollow of their\r\ncoffin.\r\n\r\n\"Cannot we open the window a little?\" said Duroy. \"It seems to me that\r\nthe air is tainted.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she replied, \"I have just noticed it, too.\"\r\n\r\nHe went to the window and opened it. All the perfumed freshness of night\r\nflowed in, agitating the flame of the two lighted candles beside the\r\nbed. The moon was shedding, as on the former evening, her full mellow\r\nlight upon the white walls of the villas and the broad glittering\r\nexpanse of the sea. Duroy, drawing in the air to the full depth of his\r\nlungs, felt himself suddenly seized with hope, and, as it were buoyed up\r\nby the approach of happiness. He turned round, saying: \"Come and get a\r\nlittle fresh air. It is delightful.\"\r\n\r\nShe came quietly, and leant on the window-sill beside him. Then he\r\nmurmured in a low tone: \"Listen to me, and try to understand what I want\r\nto tell you. Above all, do not be indignant at my speaking to you of\r\nsuch a matter at such a moment, for I shall leave you the day after\r\nto-morrow, and when you return to Paris it may be too late. I am only a\r\npoor devil without fortune, and with a position yet to make, as you\r\nknow. But I have a firm will, some brains I believe, and I am well on\r\nthe right track. With a man who has made his position, one knows what\r\none gets; with one who is starting, one never knows where he may finish.\r\nSo much the worse, or so much the better. In short, I told you one day\r\nat your house that my brightest dream would have been to have married a\r\nwoman like you. I repeat this wish to you now. Do not answer, let me\r\ncontinue. It is not a proposal I am making to you. The time and place\r\nwould render that odious. I wish only not to leave you ignorant that you\r\ncan make me happy with a word; that you can make me either a friend and\r\nbrother, or a husband, at your will; that my heart and myself are yours.\r\nI do not want you to answer me now. I do not want us to speak any more\r\nabout the matter here. When we meet again in Paris you will let me know\r\nwhat you have resolved upon. Until then, not a word. Is it not so?\" He\r\nhad uttered all this without looking at her, as though scattering his\r\nwords abroad in the night before him. She seemed not to have heard them,\r\nso motionless had she remained, looking also straight before her with a\r\nfixed and vague stare at the vast landscape lit up by the moon. They\r\nremained for some time side by side, elbow touching elbow, silent and\r\nreflecting. Then she murmured: \"It is rather cold,\" and turning round,\r\nreturned towards the bed.\r\n\r\nHe followed her. When he drew near he recognized that Forestier's body\r\nwas really beginning to smell, and drew his chair to a distance, for he\r\ncould not have stood this odor of putrefaction long. He said: \"He must\r\nbe put in a coffin the first thing in the morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes, it is arranged,\" she replied. \"The undertaker will be here at\r\neight o'clock.\"\r\n\r\nDuroy having sighed out the words, \"Poor fellow,\" she, too, gave a long\r\nsigh of heartrending resignation.\r\n\r\nThey did not look at the body so often now, already accustomed to the\r\nidea of it, and beginning to mentally consent to the decease which but a\r\nshort time back had shocked and angered them--them who were mortals,\r\ntoo. They no longer spoke, continuing to keep watch in befitting fashion\r\nwithout going to sleep. But towards midnight Duroy dozed off the first.\r\nWhen he woke up he saw that Madame Forestier was also slumbering, and\r\nhaving shifted to a more comfortable position, he reclosed his eyes,\r\ngrowling: \"Confound it all, it is more comfortable between the sheets\r\nall the same.\"\r\n\r\nA sudden noise made him start up. The nurse was entering the room. It\r\nwas broad daylight. The young wife in the armchair in front of him\r\nseemed as surprised as himself. She was somewhat pale, but still pretty,\r\nfresh-looking, and nice, in spite of this night passed in a chair.\r\n\r\nThen, having glanced at the corpse, Duroy started and exclaimed: \"Oh,\r\nhis beard!\" The beard had grown in a few hours on this decomposing flesh\r\nas much as it would have in several days on a living face. And they\r\nstood scared by this life continuing in death, as though in presence of\r\nsome fearful prodigy, some supernatural threat of resurrection, one of\r\nthese startling and abnormal events which upset and confound the mind.\r\n\r\nThey both went and lay down until eleven o'clock. Then they placed\r\nCharles in his coffin, and at once felt relieved and soothed. They had\r\nsat down face to face at lunch with an aroused desire to speak of the\r\nlivelier and more consolatory matters, to return to the things of life\r\nagain, since they had done with the dead. Through the wide-open window\r\nthe soft warmth of spring flowed in, bearing the perfumed breath of the\r\nbed of pinks in bloom before the door.\r\n\r\nMadame Forestier suggested a stroll in the garden to Duroy, and they\r\nbegan to walk slowly round the little lawn, inhaling with pleasure the\r\nbalmy air, laden with the scent of pine and eucalyptus. Suddenly she\r\nbegan to speak, without turning her head towards him, as he had done\r\nduring the night upstairs. She uttered her words slowly, in a low and\r\nserious voice.\r\n\r\n\"Look here, my dear friend, I have deeply reflected already on what you\r\nproposed to me, and I do not want you to go away without an answer.\r\nBesides, I am neither going to say yes nor no. We will wait, we will\r\nsee, we will know one another better. Reflect, too, on your side. Do not\r\ngive way to impulse. But if I speak to you of this before even poor\r\nCharles is lowered into the tomb, it is because it is necessary, after\r\nwhat you have said to me, that you should thoroughly understand what\r\nsort of woman I am, in order that you may no longer cherish the wish you\r\nexpressed to me, in case you are not of a--of a--disposition to\r\ncomprehend and bear with me. Understand me well. Marriage for me is not\r\na charm, but a partnership. I mean to be free, perfectly free as to my\r\nways, my acts, my going and coming. I could neither tolerate\r\nsupervision, nor jealousy, nor arguments as to my behavior. I should\r\nundertake, be it understood, never to compromise the name of the man who\r\ntakes me as his wife, never to render him hateful and ridiculous. But\r\nthis man must also undertake to see in me an equal, an ally, and not an\r\ninferior or an obedient and submissive wife. My notions, I know, are not\r\nthose of every one, but I shall not change them. There you are. I will\r\nalso add, do not answer me; it would be useless and unsuitable. We shall\r\nsee one another again, and shall perhaps speak of all this again later\r\non. Now, go for a stroll. I shall return to watch beside him. Till this\r\nevening.\"\r\n\r\nHe printed a long kiss on her hand, and went away without uttering a\r\nword. That evening they only saw one another at dinnertime. Then they\r\nretired to their rooms, both exhausted with fatigue.\r\n\r\nCharles Forestier was buried the next day, without any funeral display,\r\nin the cemetery at Cannes. George Duroy wished to take the Paris\r\nexpress, which passed through the town at half-past one.\r\n\r\nMadame Forestier drove with him to the station. They walked quietly up\r\nand down the platform pending the time for his departure, speaking of\r\ntrivial matters.\r\n\r\nThe train rolled into the station. The journalist took his seat, and\r\nthen got out again to have a few more moments' conversation with her,\r\nsuddenly seized as he was with sadness and a strong regret at leaving\r\nher, as though he were about to lose her for ever.\r\n\r\nA porter shouted, \"Take your seats for Marseilles, Lyons, and Paris.\"\r\nDuroy got in and leant out of the window to say a few more words. The\r\nengine whistled, and the train began to move slowly on.\r\n\r\nThe young fellow, leaning out of the carriage, watched the woman\r\nstanding still on the platform and following him with her eyes.\r\nSuddenly, as he was about to lose sight of her, he put his hand to his\r\nmouth and threw a kiss towards her. She returned it with a discreet and\r\nhesitating gesture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge Duroy had returned to all his old habits.\r\n\r\nInstalled at present in the little ground-floor suite of rooms in the\r\nRue de Constantinople, he lived soberly, like a man preparing a new\r\nexistence for himself.\r\n\r\nMadame Forestier had not yet returned. She was lingering at Cannes. He\r\nreceived a letter from her merely announcing her return about the middle\r\nof April, without a word of allusion to their farewell. He was waiting,\r\nhis mind was thoroughly made up now to employ every means in order to\r\nmarry her, if she seemed to hesitate. But he had faith in his luck,\r\nconfidence in that power of seduction which he felt within him, a vague\r\nand irresistible power which all women felt the influence of.\r\n\r\nA short note informed him that the decisive hour was about to strike: \"I\r\nam in Paris. Come and see me.--Madeleine Forestier.\"\r\n\r\nNothing more. He received it by the nine o'clock post. He arrived at her\r\nresidence at three on the same day. She held out both hands to him\r\nsmiling with her pleasant smile, and they looked into one another's eyes\r\nfor a few seconds. Then she said: \"How good you were to come to me there\r\nunder those terrible circumstances.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should have done anything you told me to,\" he replied.\r\n\r\nAnd they sat down. She asked the news, inquired about the Walters, about\r\nall the staff, about the paper. She had often thought about the paper.\r\n\r\n\"I miss that a great deal,\" she said, \"really a very great deal. I had\r\nbecome at heart a journalist. What would you, I love the profession?\"\r\n\r\nThen she paused. He thought he understood, he thought he divined in her\r\nsmile, in the tone of her voice, in her words themselves a kind of\r\ninvitation, and although he had promised to himself not to precipitate\r\nmatters, he stammered out: \"Well, then--why--why should you not\r\nresume--this occupation--under--under the name of Duroy?\"\r\n\r\nShe suddenly became serious again, and placing her hand on his arm,\r\nmurmured: \"Do not let us speak of that yet a while.\"\r\n\r\nBut he divined that she accepted, and falling at her knees began to\r\npassionately kiss her hands, repeating: \"Thanks, thanks; oh, how I love\r\nyou!\"\r\n\r\nShe rose. He did so, too, and noted that she was very pale. Then he\r\nunderstood that he had pleased her, for a long time past, perhaps, and\r\nas they found themselves face to face, he clasped her to him and printed\r\na long, tender, and decorous kiss on her forehead. When she had freed\r\nherself, slipping through his arms, she said in a serious tone: \"Listen,\r\nI have not yet made up my mind to anything. However, it may be--yes. But\r\nyou must promise me the most absolute secrecy till I give you leave to\r\nspeak.\"\r\n\r\nHe swore this, and left, his heart overflowing with joy.\r\n\r\nHe was from that time forward very discreet as regards the visits he\r\npaid her, and did not ask for any more definite consent on her part, for\r\nshe had a way of speaking of the future, of saying \"by-and-by,\" and of\r\nshaping plans in which these two lives were blended, which answered him\r\nbetter and more delicately than a formal acceptation.\r\n\r\nDuroy worked hard and spent little, trying to save money so as not to be\r\nwithout a penny at the date fixed for his marriage, and becoming as\r\nclose as he had been prodigal. The summer went by, and then the autumn,\r\nwithout anyone suspecting anything, for they met very little, and only\r\nin the most natural way in the world.\r\n\r\nOne evening, Madeleine, looking him straight in the eyes said: \"You have\r\nnot yet announced our intentions to Madame de Marelle?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, dear, having promised you to be secret, I have not opened my mouth\r\nto a living soul.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it is about time to tell her. I will undertake to inform the\r\nWalters. You will do so this week, will you not?\"\r\n\r\nHe blushed as he said: \"Yes, to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nShe had turned away her eyes in order not to notice his confusion, and\r\nsaid: \"If you like we will be married in the beginning of May. That will\r\nbe a very good time.\"\r\n\r\n\"I obey you in all things with joy.\"\r\n\r\n\"The tenth of May, which is a Saturday, will suit me very nicely, for it\r\nis my birthday.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, the tenth of May.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your parents live near Rouen, do they not? You have told me so, at\r\nleast.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, near Rouen, at Canteleu.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are they?\"\r\n\r\n\"They are--they are small annuitants.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! I should very much like to know them.\"\r\n\r\nHe hesitated, greatly perplexed, and said: \"But, you see, they are--\"\r\nThen making up his mind, like a really clever man, he went on: \"My dear,\r\nthey are mere country folk, innkeepers, who have pinched themselves to\r\nthe utmost to enable me to pursue my studies. For my part, I am not\r\nashamed of them, but their--simplicity--their rustic manners--might,\r\nperhaps, render you uncomfortable.\"\r\n\r\nShe smiled, delightfully, her face lit up with gentle kindness as she\r\nreplied: \"No. I shall be very fond of them. We will go and see them. I\r\nwant to. I will speak of this to you again. I, too, am a daughter of\r\npoor people, but I have lost my parents. I have no longer anyone in the\r\nworld.\" She held out her hand to him as she added: \"But you.\"\r\n\r\nHe felt softened, moved, overcome, as he had been by no other woman.\r\n\r\n\"I had thought about one matter,\" she continued, \"but it is rather\r\ndifficult to explain.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Well, it is this, my dear boy, I am like all women, I have my\r\nweaknesses, my pettinesses. I love all that glitters, that catches the\r\near. I should have so delighted to have borne a noble name. Could you\r\nnot, on the occasion of your marriage, ennoble yourself a little?\"\r\n\r\nShe had blushed in her turn, as if she had proposed something\r\nindelicate.\r\n\r\nHe replied simply enough: \"I have often thought about it, but it did not\r\nseem to me so easy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why so?\"\r\n\r\nHe began to laugh, saying: \"Because I was afraid of making myself look\r\nridiculous.\"\r\n\r\nShe shrugged her shoulders. \"Not at all, not at all Every one does it,\r\nand nobody laughs. Separate your name in two--Du Roy. That looks very\r\nwell.\"\r\n\r\nHe replied at once like a man who understands the matter in question:\r\n\"No, that will not do at all. It is too simple, too common, too\r\nwell-known. I had thought of taking the name of my native place, as a\r\nliterary pseudonym at first, then of adding it to my own by degrees, and\r\nthen, later on, of even cutting my name in two, as you suggest.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your native place is Canteleu?\" she queried.\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nShe hesitated, saying: \"No, I do not like the termination. Come, cannot\r\nwe modify this word Canteleu a little?\"\r\n\r\nShe had taken up a pen from the table, and was scribbling names and\r\nstudying their physiognomy. All at once she exclaimed: \"There, there it\r\nis!\" and held out to him a paper, on which read--\"Madame Duroy de\r\nCantel.\"\r\n\r\nHe reflected a few moments, and then said gravely: \"Yes, that does very\r\nwell.\"\r\n\r\nShe was delighted, and kept repeating \"Duroy de Cantel, Duroy de Cantel,\r\nMadame Duroy de Cantel. It is capital, capital.\" She went on with an air\r\nof conviction: \"And you will see how easy it is to get everyone to\r\naccept it. But one must know how to seize the opportunity, for it will\r\nbe too late afterwards. You must from to-morrow sign your descriptive\r\narticles D. de Cantel, and your 'Echoes' simply Duroy. It is done every\r\nday in the press, and no one will be astonished to see you take a\r\npseudonym. At the moment of our marriage we can modify it yet a little\r\nmore, and tell our friends that you had given up the 'Du' out of modesty\r\non account of your position, or even say nothing about it. What is your\r\nfather's Christian name?\"\r\n\r\n\"Alexander.\"\r\n\r\nShe murmured: \"Alexander, Alexander,\" two or three times, listening to\r\nthe sonorous roll of the syllables, and then wrote on a blank sheet of\r\npaper:\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur and Madame Alexander Du Roy de Cantel have the honor to inform\r\nyou of the marriage of Monsieur George Du Roy de Cantel, their son, to\r\nMadame Madeleine Forestier.\" She looked at her writing, holding it at a\r\ndistance, charmed by the effect, and said: \"With a little method we can\r\nmanage whatever we wish.\"\r\n\r\nWhen he found himself once more in the street, firmly resolved to call\r\nhimself in future Du Roy, and even Du Roy de Cantel, it seemed to him\r\nthat he had acquired fresh importance. He walked with more swagger, his\r\nhead higher, his moustache fiercer, as a gentleman should walk. He felt\r\nin himself a species of joyous desire to say to the passers-by: \"My name\r\nis Du Roy de Cantel.\"\r\n\r\nBut scarcely had he got home than the thought of Madame de Marelle made\r\nhim feel uneasy, and he wrote to her at once to ask her to make an\r\nappointment for the next day.\r\n\r\n\"It will be a tough job,\" he thought. \"I must look out for squalls.\"\r\n\r\nThen he made up his mind for it, with the native carelessness which\r\ncaused him to slur over the disagreeable side of life, and began to\r\n\r\nwrite a fancy article on the fresh taxes needed in order to make the\r\nBudget balance. He set down in this the nobiliary \"De\" at a hundred\r\nfrancs a year, and titles, from baron to prince, at from five hundred to\r\nfive thousand francs. And he signed it \"D. de Cantel.\"\r\n\r\nHe received a telegram from his mistress next morning saying that she\r\nwould call at one o'clock. He waited for her somewhat feverishly, his\r\nmind made up to bring things to a point at once, to say everything right\r\nout, and then, when the first emotion had subsided, to argue cleverly in\r\norder to prove to her that he could not remain a bachelor for ever, and\r\nthat as Monsieur de Marelle insisted on living, he had been obliged to\r\nthink of another than herself as his legitimate companion. He felt\r\nmoved, though, and when he heard her ring his heart began to beat.\r\n\r\nShe threw herself into his arms, exclaiming: \"Good morning, Pretty-boy.\"\r\nThen, finding his embrace cold, looked at him, and said: \"What is the\r\nmatter with you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sit down,\" he said, \"we have to talk seriously.\"\r\n\r\nShe sat down without taking her bonnet off, only turning back her veil,\r\nand waited.\r\n\r\nHe had lowered his eyes, and was preparing the beginning of his speech.\r\nHe commenced in a low tone of voice: \"My dear one, you see me very\r\nuneasy, very sad, and very much embarrassed at what I have to admit to\r\nyou. I love you dearly. I really love you from the bottom of my heart,\r\nso that the fear of causing you pain afflicts me more than even the news\r\nI am going to tell you.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nShe grew pale, felt herself tremble, and stammered out: \"What is the\r\nmatter? Tell me at once.\"\r\n\r\nHe said in sad but resolute tones, with that feigned dejection which we\r\nmake use of to announce fortunate misfortunes: \"I am going to be\r\nmarried.\"\r\n\r\nShe gave the sigh of a woman who is about to faint, a painful sigh from\r\nthe very depths of her bosom, and then began to choke and gasp without\r\nbeing able to speak.\r\n\r\nSeeing that she did not say anything, he continued: \"You cannot imagine\r\nhow much I suffered before coming to this resolution. But I have neither\r\nposition nor money. I am alone, lost in Paris. I needed beside me\r\nsomeone who above all would be an adviser, a consoler, and a stay. It is\r\na partner, an ally, that I have sought, and that I have found.\"\r\n\r\nHe was silent, hoping that she would reply, expecting furious rage,\r\nviolence, and insults. She had placed one hand on her heart as though to\r\nrestrain its throbbings, and continued to draw her breath by painful\r\nefforts, which made her bosom heave spasmodically and her head nod to\r\nand fro. He took her other hand, which was resting on the arm of the\r\nchair, but she snatched it away abruptly. Then she murmured, as though\r\nin a state of stupefaction: \"Oh, my God!\"\r\n\r\nHe knelt down before her, without daring to touch her, however, and more\r\ndeeply moved by this silence than he would have been by a fit of anger,\r\nstammered out: \"Clo! my darling Clo! just consider my situation,\r\nconsider what I am. Oh! if I had been able to marry you, what happiness\r\nit would have been. But you are married. What could I do? Come, think of\r\nit, now. I must take a place in society, and I cannot do it so long as I\r\nhave not a home. If you only knew. There are days when I have felt a\r\nlonging to kill your husband.\"\r\n\r\nHe spoke in his soft, subdued, seductive voice, a voice which entered\r\nthe ear like music. He saw two tears slowly gather in the fixed and\r\nstaring eyes of his mistress and then roll down her cheeks, while two\r\nmore were already formed on the eyelids.\r\n\r\nHe murmured: \"Do not cry, Clo; do not cry, I beg of you. You rend my\r\nvery heart.\"\r\n\r\nThen she made an effort, a strong effort, to be proud and dignified, and\r\nasked, in the quivering tone of a woman about to burst into sobs: \"Who\r\nis it?\"\r\n\r\nHe hesitated a moment, and then understanding that he must, said:\r\n\r\n\"Madeleine Forestier.\"\r\n\r\nMadame de Marelle shuddered all over, and remained silent, so deep in\r\nthought that she seemed to have forgotten that he was at her feet. And\r\ntwo transparent drops kept continually forming in her eyes, falling and\r\nforming again.\r\n\r\nShe rose. Duroy guessed that she was going away without saying a word,\r\nwithout reproach or forgiveness, and he felt hurt and humiliated to the\r\nbottom of his soul. Wishing to stay her, he threw his arms about the\r\nskirt of her dress, clasping through the stuff her rounded legs, which\r\nhe felt stiffen in resistance. He implored her, saying: \"I beg of you,\r\ndo not go away like that.\"\r\n\r\nThen she looked down on him from above with that moistened and\r\ndespairing eye, at once so charming and so sad, which shows all the\r\ngrief of a woman's heart, and gasped out: \"I--I have nothing to say. I\r\nhave nothing to do with it. You--you are right. You--you have chosen\r\nwell.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, freeing herself by a backward movement, she left the room without\r\nhis trying to detain her further.\r\n\r\nLeft to himself, he rose as bewildered as if he had received a blow on\r\nthe head. Then, making up his mind, he muttered: \"Well, so much the\r\nworse or the better. It is over, and without a scene; I prefer that,\"\r\nand relieved from an immense weight, suddenly feeling himself free,\r\ndelivered, at ease as to his future life, he began to spar at the wall,\r\nhitting out with his fists in a kind of intoxication of strength and\r\ntriumph, as if he had been fighting Fate.\r\n\r\nWhen Madame Forestier asked: \"Have you told Madame de Marelle?\" he\r\nquietly answered, \"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nShe scanned him closely with her bright eyes, saying: \"And did it not\r\ncause her any emotion?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, not at all. She thought it, on the contrary, a very good idea.\"\r\n\r\nThe news was soon known. Some were astonished, others asserted that they\r\nhad foreseen it; others, again, smiled, and let it be understood that\r\nthey were not surprised.\r\n\r\nThe young man who now signed his descriptive articles D. de Cantel, his\r\n\"Echoes\" Duroy, and the political articles which he was beginning to\r\nwrite from time to time Du Roy, passed half his time with his betrothed,\r\nwho treated him with a fraternal familiarity into which, however,\r\nentered a real but hidden love, a species of desire concealed as a\r\nweakness. She had decided that the marriage should be quite private,\r\nonly the witnesses being present, and that they should leave the same\r\nevening for Rouen. They would go the next day to see the journalist's\r\nparents, and remain with them some days. Duroy had striven to get her to\r\nrenounce this project, but not having been able to do so, had ended by\r\ngiving in to it.\r\n\r\nSo the tenth of May having come, the newly-married couple, having\r\nconsidered the religious ceremony useless since they had not invited\r\nanyone, returned to finish packing their boxes after a brief visit to\r\nthe Town Hall. They took, at the Saint Lazare terminus, the six o'clock\r\ntrain, which bore them away towards Normandy. They had scarcely\r\nexchanged twenty words up to the time that they found themselves alone\r\nin the railway carriage. As soon as they felt themselves under way, they\r\nlooked at one another and began to laugh, to hide a certain feeling of\r\nawkwardness which they did not want to manifest.\r\n\r\nThe train slowly passed through the long station of Batignolles, and\r\nthen crossed the mangy-looking plain extending from the fortifications\r\nto the Seine. Duroy and his wife from time to time made a few idle\r\nremarks, and then turned again towards the windows. When they crossed\r\nthe bridge of Asnieres, a feeling of greater liveliness was aroused in\r\nthem at the sight of the river covered with boats, fishermen, and\r\noarsmen. The sun, a bright May sun, shed its slanting rays upon the\r\ncraft and upon the smooth stream, which seemed motionless, without\r\ncurrent or eddy, checked, as it were, beneath the heat and brightness of\r\nthe declining day. A sailing boat in the middle of the river having\r\nspread two large triangular sails of snowy canvas, wing and wing, to\r\ncatch the faintest puffs of wind, looked like an immense bird preparing\r\nto take flight.\r\n\r\nDuroy murmured: \"I adore the neighborhood of Paris. I have memories of\r\ndinners which I reckon among the pleasantest in my life.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the boats,\" she replied. \"How nice it is to glide along at sunset.\"\r\n\r\nThen they became silent, as though afraid to continue their outpourings\r\nas to their past life, and remained so, already enjoying, perhaps, the\r\npoesy of regret.\r\n\r\nDuroy, seated face to face with his wife, took her hand and slowly\r\nkissed it. \"When we get back again,\" said he, \"we will go and dine\r\nsometimes at Chatou.\"\r\n\r\nShe murmured: \"We shall have so many things to do,\" in a tone of voice\r\nthat seemed to imply, \"The agreeable must be sacrificed to the useful.\"\r\n\r\nHe still held her hand, asking himself with some uneasiness by what\r\ntransition he should reach the caressing stage. He would not have felt\r\nuneasy in the same way in presence of the ignorance of a young girl, but\r\nthe lively and artful intelligence he felt existed in Madeleine,\r\nrendered his attitude an embarrassed one. He was afraid of appearing\r\nstupid to her, too timid or too brutal, too slow or too prompt. He kept\r\npressing her hand gently, without her making any response to this\r\nappeal. At length he said: \"It seems to me very funny for you to be my\r\nwife.\"\r\n\r\nShe seemed surprised as she said: \"Why so?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not know. It seems strange to me. I want to kiss you, and I feel\r\nastonished at having the right to do so.\"\r\n\r\nShe calmly held out her cheek to him, which he kissed as he would have\r\nkissed that of a sister.\r\n\r\nHe continued: \"The first time I saw you--you remember the dinner\r\nForestier invited me to--I thought, 'Hang it all, if I could only find a\r\nwife like that.' Well, it's done. I have one.\"\r\n\r\nShe said, in a low tone: \"That is very nice,\" and looked him straight in\r\nthe face, shrewdly, and with smiling eyes.\r\n\r\nHe reflected, \"I am too cold. I am stupid. I ought to get along quicker\r\nthan this,\" and asked: \"How did you make Forestier's acquaintance?\"\r\n\r\nShe replied, with provoking archness: \"Are we going to Rouen to talk\r\nabout him?\"\r\n\r\nHe reddened, saying: \"I am a fool. But you frighten me a great deal.\"\r\n\r\nShe was delighted, saying: \"I--impossible! How is it?\"\r\n\r\nHe had seated himself close beside her. She suddenly exclaimed: \"Oh! a\r\nstag.\"\r\n\r\nThe train was passing through the forest of Saint Germaine, and she had\r\nseen a frightened deer clear one of the paths at a bound. Duroy, leaning\r\nforward as she looked out of the open window, printed a long kiss, a\r\nlover's kiss, among the hair on her neck. She remained still for a few\r\nseconds, and then, raising her head, said: \"You are tickling me. Leave\r\noff.\"\r\n\r\nBut he would not go away, but kept on pressing his curly moustache\r\nagainst her white skin in a long and thrilling caress.\r\n\r\nShe shook herself, saying: \"Do leave off.\"\r\n\r\nHe had taken her head in his right hand, passed around her, and turned\r\nit towards him. Then he darted on her mouth like a hawk on its prey. She\r\nstruggled, repulsed him, tried to free herself. She succeeded at last,\r\nand repeated: \"Do leave off.\"\r\n\r\nHe remained seated, very red and chilled by this sensible remark; then,\r\nhaving recovered more self-possession, he said, with some liveliness:\r\n\"Very well, I will wait, but I shan't be able to say a dozen words till\r\nwe get to Rouen. And remember that we are only passing through Poissy.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will do the talking then,\" she said, and sat down quietly beside him.\r\n\r\nShe spoke with precision of what they would do on their return. They\r\nmust keep on the suite of apartments that she had resided in with her\r\nfirst husband, and Duroy would also inherit the duties and salary of\r\nForestier at the _Vie Francaise_. Before their union, besides, she had\r\nplanned out, with the certainty of a man of business, all the financial\r\ndetails of their household. They had married under a settlement\r\npreserving to each of them their respective estates, and every incident\r\nthat might arise--death, divorce, the birth of one or more children--was\r\nduly provided for. The young fellow contributed a capital of four\r\nthousand francs, he said, but of that sum he had borrowed fifteen\r\nhundred. The rest was due to savings effected during the year in view of\r\nthe event. Her contribution was forty thousand francs, which she said\r\nhad been left her by Forestier.\r\n\r\nShe returned to him as a subject of conversation. \"He was a very steady,\r\neconomical, hard-working fellow. He would have made a fortune in a very\r\nshort time.\"\r\n\r\nDuroy no longer listened, wholly absorbed by other thoughts. She stopped\r\nfrom time to time to follow out some inward train of ideas, and then\r\nwent on: \"In three or four years you can be easily earning thirty to\r\nforty thousand francs a year. That is what Charles would have had if he\r\nhad lived.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge, who began to find the lecture rather a long one, replied: \"I\r\nthought we were not going to Rouen to talk about him.\"\r\n\r\nShe gave him a slight tap on the cheek, saying, with a laugh: \"That is\r\nso. I am in the wrong.\"\r\n\r\nHe made a show of sitting with his hands on his knees like a very good\r\nboy.\r\n\r\n\"You look very like a simpleton like that,\" said she.\r\n\r\nHe replied: \"That is my part, of which, by the way, you reminded me just\r\nnow, and I shall continue to play it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Because it is you who take management of the household, and even of me.\r\nThat, indeed, concerns you, as being a widow.\"\r\n\r\nShe was amazed, saying: \"What do you really mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"That you have an experience that should enlighten my ignorance, and\r\nmatrimonial practice that should polish up my bachelor innocence, that's\r\nall.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is too much,\" she exclaimed.\r\n\r\nHe replied: \"That is so. I don't know anything about ladies; no, and you\r\nknow all about gentlemen, for you are a widow. You must undertake my\r\neducation--this evening--and you can begin at once if you like.\"\r\n\r\nShe exclaimed, very much amused: \"Oh, indeed, if you reckon on me for\r\nthat!\"\r\n\r\nHe repeated, in the tone of a school boy stumbling through his lesson:\r\n\"Yes, I do. I reckon that you will give me solid information--in twenty\r\nlessons. Ten for the elements, reading and grammar; ten for finishing\r\naccomplishments. I don't know anything myself.\"\r\n\r\nShe exclaimed, highly amused: \"You goose.\"\r\n\r\nHe replied: \"If that is the familiar tone you take, I will follow your\r\nexample, and tell you, darling, that I adore you more and more every\r\nmoment, and that I find Rouen a very long way off.\"\r\n\r\nHe spoke now with a theatrical intonation and with a series of changes\r\nof facial expression, which amused his companion, accustomed to the ways\r\nof literary Bohemia. She glanced at him out of the corner of her eye,\r\nfinding him really charming, and experiencing the longing we have to\r\npluck a fruit from the tree at once, and the check of reason which\r\nadvises us to wait till dinner to eat it at the proper time. Then she\r\nobserved, blushing somewhat at the thoughts which assailed her: \"My dear\r\nlittle pupil, trust my experience, my great experience. Kisses in a\r\nrailway train are not worth anything. They only upset one.\" Then she\r\nblushed still more as she murmured: \"One should never eat one's corn in\r\nthe ear.\"\r\n\r\nHe chuckled, kindling at the double meanings from her pretty mouth, and\r\nmade the sign of the cross, with a movement of the lips, as though\r\nmurmuring a prayer, adding aloud: \"I have placed myself under the\r\nprotection of St. Anthony, patron-saint of temptations. Now I am\r\nadamant.\"\r\n\r\nNight was stealing gently on, wrapping in its transparent shadow, like a\r\nfine gauze, the broad landscape stretching away to the right. The train\r\nwas running along the Seine, and the young couple began to watch the\r\ncrimson reflections on the surface of the river, winding like a broad\r\nstrip of polished metal alongside the line, patches fallen from the sky,\r\nwhich the departing sun had kindled into flame. These reflections slowly\r\ndied out, grew deeper, faded sadly. The landscape became dark with that\r\nsinister thrill, that deathlike quiver, which each twilight causes to\r\npass over the earth. This evening gloom, entering the open window,\r\npenetrated the two souls, but lately so lively, of the now silent pair.\r\n\r\nThey had drawn more closely together to watch the dying day. At Nantes\r\nthe railway people had lit the little oil lamp, which shed its yellow,\r\n\r\ntrembling light upon the drab cloth of the cushions. Duroy passed his\r\narms round the waist of his wife, and clasped her to him. His recent\r\nkeen desire had become a softened one, a longing for consoling little\r\ncaresses, such as we lull children with.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe murmured softly: \"I shall love you very dearly, my little Made.\"\r\n\r\nThe softness of his voice stirred the young wife, and caused a rapid\r\nthrill to run through her. She offered her mouth, bending towards him,\r\nfor he was resting his cheek upon the warm pillow of her bosom, until\r\nthe whistle of the train announced that they were nearing a station. She\r\nremarked, flattening the ruffled locks about her forehead with the tips\r\nof her fingers: \"It was very silly. We are quite childish.\"\r\n\r\nBut he was kissing her hands in turn with feverish rapidity, and\r\nreplied: \"I adore you, my little Made.\"\r\n\r\nUntil they reached Rouen they remained almost motionless, cheek against\r\ncheek, their eyes turned to the window, through which, from time to\r\ntime, the lights of houses could be seen in the darkness, satisfied with\r\nfeeling themselves so close to one another, and with the growing\r\nanticipation of a freer and more intimate embrace.\r\n\r\nThey put up at a hotel overlooking the quay, and went to bed after a\r\nvery hurried supper.\r\n\r\nThe chambermaid aroused them next morning as it was striking eight. When\r\nthey had drank the cup of tea she had placed on the night-table, Duroy\r\nlooked at his wife, then suddenly, with the joyful impulse of the\r\nfortunate man who has just found a treasure, he clasped her in his arms,\r\nexclaiming: \"My little Made, I am sure that I love you ever so much,\r\never so much, ever so much.\"\r\n\r\nShe smiled with her confident and satisfied smile, and murmured, as she\r\nreturned his kisses: \"And I too--perhaps.\"\r\n\r\nBut he still felt uneasy about the visit of his parents. He had already\r\nforewarned his wife, had prepared and lectured her, but he thought fit\r\nto do so again.\r\n\r\n\"You know,\" he said, \"they are only rustics--country rustics, not\r\ntheatrical ones.\"\r\n\r\nShe laughed.\r\n\r\n\"But I know that: you have told me so often enough. Come, get up and let\r\nme get up.\"\r\n\r\nHe jumped out of bed, and said, as he drew on his socks:\r\n\r\n\"We shall be very uncomfortable there, very uncomfortable. There is only\r\nan old straw palliasse in my room. Spring mattresses are unknown at\r\nCanteleu.\"\r\n\r\nShe seemed delighted.\r\n\r\n\"So much the better. It will be delightful to sleep\r\nbadly--beside--beside you, and to be woke up by the crowing of the\r\ncocks.\"\r\n\r\nShe had put on her dressing-gown--a white flannel dressing-gown--which\r\nDuroy at once recognized. The sight of it was unpleasant to him. Why?\r\nHis wife had, he was aware, a round dozen of these morning garments. She\r\ncould not destroy her trousseau in order to buy a new one. No matter, he\r\nwould have preferred that her bed-linen, her night-linen, her\r\nunder-clothing were not the same she had made use of with the other. It\r\nseemed to him that the soft, warm stuff must have retained something\r\nfrom its contact with Forestier.\r\n\r\nHe walked to the window, lighting a cigarette. The sight of the port,\r\nthe broad stream covered with vessels with tapering spars, the steamers\r\nnoisily unloading alongside the quay, stirred him, although he had been\r\nacquainted with it all for a long time past, and he exclaimed: \"By Jove!\r\nit is a fine sight.\"\r\n\r\nMadeleine approached, and placing both hands on one of her husband's\r\nshoulders, leaned against him with careless grace, charmed and\r\ndelighted. She kept repeating: \"Oh! how pretty, how pretty. I did not\r\nknow that there were so many ships as that.\"\r\n\r\nThey started an hour later, for they were to lunch with the old people,\r\nwho had been forewarned some days beforehand. A rusty open carriage bore\r\nthem along with a noise of jolting ironmongery. They followed a long and\r\nrather ugly boulevard, passed between some fields through which flowed a\r\nstream, and began to ascend the slope. Madeleine, somewhat fatigued, had\r\ndozed off beneath the penetrating caress of the sun, which warmed her\r\ndelightfully as she lay stretched back in the old carriage as though in\r\na bath of light and country air.\r\n\r\nHer husband awoke her, saying: \"Look!\"\r\n\r\nThey had halted two-thirds of the way up the slope, at a spot famous for\r\nthe view, and to which all tourists drive. They overlooked the long and\r\nbroad valley through which the bright river flowed in sweeping curves.\r\nIt could be caught sight of in the distance, dotted with numerous\r\nislands, and describing a wide sweep before flowing through Rouen. Then\r\nthe town appeared on the right bank, slightly veiled in the morning\r\nmist, but with rays of sunlight falling on its roofs; its thousand squat\r\nor pointed spires, light, fragile-looking, wrought like gigantic jewels;\r\nits round or square towers topped with heraldic crowns; its belfries;\r\nthe numerous Gothic summits of its churches, overtopped by the sharp\r\nspire of the cathedral, that surprising spike of bronze--strange, ugly,\r\nand out of all proportion, the tallest in the world. Facing it, on the\r\nother side of the river, rose the factory chimneys of the suburb of\r\nSaint Serves--tall, round, and broadening at their summit. More numerous\r\nthan their sister spires, they reared even in the distant country, their\r\ntall brick columns, and vomited into the blue sky their black and coaly\r\nbreath. Highest of all, as high as the second of the summits reared by\r\nhuman labor, the pyramid of Cheops, almost level with its proud\r\ncompanion the cathedral spire, the great steam-pump of La Foudre seemed\r\nthe queen of the busy, smoking factories, as the other was the queen of\r\nthe sacred edifices. Further on, beyond the workmen's town, stretched a\r\nforest of pines, and the Seine, having passed between the two divisions\r\nof the city, continued its way, skirting a tall rolling slope, wooded at\r\nthe summit, and showing here and there its bare bone of white stone.\r\nThen the river disappeared on the horizon, after again describing a long\r\nsweeping curve. Ships could be seen ascending and descending the stream,\r\ntowed by tugs as big as flies and belching forth thick smoke. Islands\r\nwere stretched along the water in a line, one close to the other, or\r\nwith wide intervals between them, like the unequal beads of a verdant\r\nrosary.\r\n\r\nThe driver waited until the travelers' ecstasies were over. He knew from\r\nexperience the duration of the admiration of all the breed of tourists.\r\nBut when he started again Duroy suddenly caught sight of two old people\r\nadvancing towards them some hundreds of yards further on, and jumped\r\nout, exclaiming: \"There they are. I recognize them.\"\r\n\r\nThere were two country-folk, a man and a woman, walking with irregular\r\nsteps, rolling in their gait, and sometimes knocking their shoulders\r\ntogether. The man was short and strongly built, high colored and\r\ninclined to stoutness, but powerful, despite his years. The woman was\r\ntall, spare, bent, careworn, the real hard-working country-woman who has\r\ntoiled afield from childhood, and has never had time to amuse herself,\r\nwhile her husband has been joking and drinking with the customers.\r\nMadeleine had also alighted from the carriage, and she watched these two\r\npoor creatures coming towards them with a pain at her heart, a sadness\r\nshe had not anticipated. They had not recognized their son in this fine\r\ngentleman and would never have guessed this handsome lady in the light\r\ndress to be their daughter-in-law. They were walking on quickly and in\r\nsilence to meet their long-looked-for boy, without noticing these city\r\nfolk followed by their carriage.\r\n\r\nThey passed by when George, who was laughing, cried out: \"Good-day,\r\nDaddy Duroy!\"\r\n\r\nThey both stopped short, amazed at first, then stupefied with surprise.\r\nThe old woman recovered herself first, and stammered, without advancing\r\na step: \"Is't thou, boy?\"\r\n\r\nThe young fellow answered: \"Yes, it is I, mother,\" and stepping up to\r\nher, kissed her on both cheeks with a son's hearty smack. Then he rubbed\r\nnoses with his father, who had taken off his cap, a very tall, black\r\nsilk cap, made Rouen fashion, like those worn by cattle dealers.\r\n\r\nThen George said: \"This is my wife,\" and the two country people looked\r\nat Madeleine. They looked at her as one looks at a phenomenon, with an\r\nuneasy fear, united in the father with a species of approving\r\nsatisfaction, in the mother with a kind of jealous enmity.\r\n\r\nThe man, who was of a joyous nature and inspired by a loveliness born of\r\nsweet cider and alcohol, grew bolder, and asked, with a twinkle in the\r\ncorner of his eyes: \"I may kiss her all the same?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" replied his son, and Madeleine, ill at ease, held out both\r\ncheeks to the sounding smacks of the rustic, who then wiped his lips\r\nwith the back of his hand. The old woman, in her turn, kissed her\r\ndaughter-in-law with a hostile reserve. No, this was not the\r\ndaughter-in-law of her dreams; the plump, fresh housewife, rosy-cheeked\r\nas an apple, and round as a brood mare. She looked like a hussy, the\r\nfine lady with her furbelows and her musk. For the old girl all perfumes\r\nwere musk.\r\n\r\nThey set out again, walking behind the carriage which bore the trunk of\r\nthe newly-wedded pair. The old fellow took his son by the arm, and\r\nkeeping him a little in the rear of the others, asked with interest:\r\n\"Well, how goes business, lad?\"\r\n\r\n\"Pretty fair.\"\r\n\r\n\"So much the better. Has thy wife any money?\"\r\n\r\n\"Forty thousand francs,\" answered George.\r\n\r\nHis father gave vent to an admiring whistle, and could only murmur,\r\n\"Dang it!\" so overcome was he by the mention of the sum. Then he added,\r\nin a tone of serious conviction: \"Dang it all, she's a fine woman!\" For\r\nhe found her to his taste, and he had passed for a good judge in his\r\nday.\r\n\r\nMadeleine and her mother-in-law were walking side by side without\r\nexchanging a word. The two men rejoined them. They reached the village,\r\na little roadside village formed of half-a-score houses on each side of\r\nthe highway, cottages and farm buildings, the former of brick and the\r\nlatter of clay, these covered with thatch and those with slates. Father\r\nDuroy's tavern, \"The Bellevue,\" a bit of a house consisting of a ground\r\nfloor and a garret, stood at the beginning of the village to the left. A\r\npine branch above the door indicated, in ancient fashion, that thirsty\r\nfolk could enter.\r\n\r\nThe things were laid for lunch, in the common room of the tavern, on two\r\ntables placed together and covered with two napkins. A neighbor, come in\r\nto help to serve the lunch, bowed low on seeing such a fine lady appear;\r\nand then, recognizing George, exclaimed: \"Good Lord! is that the\r\nyoungster?\"\r\n\r\nHe replied gayly: \"Yes, it is I, Mother Brulin,\" and kissed her as he\r\nhad kissed his father and mother. Then turning to his wife, he said:\r\n\"Come into our room and take your hat off.\"\r\n\r\nHe ushered her through a door to the right into a cold-looking room with\r\ntiled floor, white-washed walls, and a bed with white cotton curtains. A\r\ncrucifix above a holy-water stoup, and two colored pictures, one\r\nrepresenting Paul and Virginia under a blue palm tree, and the other\r\nNapoleon the First on a yellow horse, were the only ornaments of this\r\nclean and dispiriting apartment.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they were alone he kissed Madeleine, saying: \"Thanks, Made. I\r\nam glad to see the old folks again. When one is in Paris one does not\r\nthink about it; but when one meets again, it gives one pleasure all the\r\nsame.\"\r\n\r\nBut his father, thumbing the partition with his fist, cried out: \"Come\r\nalong, come along, the soup is ready,\" and they had to sit down to\r\ntable.\r\n\r\nIt was a long, countrified repast, with a succession of ill-assorted\r\ndishes, a sausage after a leg of mutton, and an omelette after a\r\nsausage. Father Duroy, excited by cider and some glasses of wine, turned\r\non the tap of his choicest jokes--those he reserved for great occasions\r\nof festivity, smutty adventures that had happened, as he maintained, to\r\nfriends of his. George, who knew all these stories, laughed,\r\nnevertheless, intoxicated by his native air, seized on by the innate\r\nlove of one's birthplace and of spots familiar from childhood, by all\r\nthe sensations and recollections once more renewed, by all the objects\r\nof yore seen again once more; by trifles, such as the mark of a knife on\r\na door, a broken chair recalling some pretty event, the smell of the\r\nsoil, the breath of the neighboring forest, the odors of the dwelling,\r\nthe gutter, the dunghill.\r\n\r\nMother Duroy did not speak, but remained sad and grim, watching her\r\ndaughter-in-law out of the corner of her eye, with hatred awakened in\r\nher heart--the hatred of an old toiler, an old rustic with fingers worn\r\nand limbs bent by hard work--for the city madame, who inspired her with\r\nthe repulsion of an accursed creature, an impure being, created for\r\nidleness and sin. She kept getting up every moment to fetch the dishes\r\nor fill the glasses with cider, sharp and yellow from the decanter, or\r\nsweet, red, and frothing from the bottles, the corks of which popped\r\nlike those of ginger beer.\r\n\r\nMadeleine scarcely ate or spoke. She wore her wonted smile upon her\r\nlips, but it was a sad and resigned one. She was downcast. Why? She had\r\nwanted to come. She had not been unaware that she was going among\r\ncountry folk--poor country folk. What had she fancied them to be--she,\r\nwho did not usually dream? Did she know herself? Do not women always\r\nhope for something that is not? Had she fancied them more poetical? No;\r\nbut perhaps better informed, more noble, more affectionate, more\r\nornamental. Yet she did not want them high-bred, like those in novels.\r\nWhence came it, then, that they shocked her by a thousand trifling,\r\nimperceptible details, by a thousand indefinable coarsenesses, by their\r\nvery nature as rustics, by their words, their gestures, and their mirth?\r\nShe recalled her own mother, of whom she never spoke to anyone--a\r\ngoverness, brought up at Saint Denis--seduced, and died from poverty and\r\ngrief when she, Madeleine, was twelve years old. An unknown hand had had\r\nher brought up. Her father, no doubt. Who was he? She did not exactly\r\nknow, although she had vague suspicions.\r\n\r\nThe lunch still dragged on. Customers were now coming in and shaking\r\nhands with the father, uttering exclamations of wonderment on seeing his\r\nson, and slyly winking as they scanned the young wife out of the corner\r\nof their eye, which was as much as to say: \"Hang it all, she's not a\r\nduffer, George Duroy's wife.\" Others, less intimate, sat down at the\r\nwooden tables, calling for \"A pot,\" \"A jugful,\" \"Two brandies,\" \"A\r\nraspail,\" and began to play at dominoes, noisily rattling the little\r\nbits of black and white bone. Mother Duroy kept passing to and fro,\r\nserving the customers, with her melancholy air, taking money, and wiping\r\nthe tables with the corner of her blue apron.\r\n\r\nThe smoke of clay pipes and sou cigars filled the room. Madeleine began\r\nto cough, and said: \"Suppose we go out; I cannot stand it.\"\r\n\r\nThey had not quite finished, and old Duroy was annoyed at this. Then she\r\ngot up and went and sat on a chair outside the door, while her\r\nfather-in-law and her husband were finishing their coffee and their nip\r\nof brandy.\r\n\r\nGeorge soon rejoined her. \"Shall we stroll down as far as the Seine?\"\r\nsaid he.\r\n\r\nShe consented with pleasure, saying: \"Oh, yes; let us go.\"\r\n\r\nThey descended the slope, hired a boat at Croisset, and passed the rest\r\nof the afternoon drowsily moored under the willows alongside an island,\r\nsoothed to slumber by the soft spring weather, and rocked by the\r\nwavelets of the river. Then they went back at nightfall.\r\n\r\nThe evening's repast, eaten by the light of a tallow candle, was still\r\nmore painful for Madeleine than that of the morning. Father Duroy, who\r\nwas half drunk, no longer spoke. The mother maintained her dogged\r\nmanner. The wretched light cast upon the gray walls the shadows of heads\r\nwith enormous noses and exaggerated movements. A great hand was seen to\r\nraise a pitchfork to a mouth opening like a dragon's maw whenever any\r\none of them, turning a little, presented a profile to the yellow,\r\nflickering flame.\r\n\r\nAs soon as dinner was over, Madeleine drew her husband out of the house,\r\nin order not to stay in this gloomy room, always reeking with an acrid\r\nsmell of old pipes and spilt liquor. As soon as they were outside, he\r\nsaid: \"You are tired of it already.\"\r\n\r\nShe began to protest, but he stopped her, saying: \"No, I saw it very\r\nplainly. If you like, we will leave to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" she murmured.\r\n\r\nThey strolled gently onward. It was a mild night, the deep,\r\nall-embracing shadow of which seemed filled with faint murmurings,\r\nrustlings, and breathings. They had entered a narrow path, overshadowed\r\nby tall trees, and running between two belts of underwood of\r\nimpenetrable blackness.\r\n\r\n\"Where are we?\" asked she.\r\n\r\n\"In the forest,\" he replied.\r\n\r\n\"Is it a large one?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very large; one of the largest in France.\"\r\n\r\nAn odor of earth, trees, and moss--that fresh yet old scent of the\r\nwoods, made up of the sap of bursting buds and the dead and moldering\r\nfoliage of the thickets, seemed to linger in the path. Raising her head,\r\nMadeleine could see the stars through the tree-tops; and although no\r\nbreeze stirred the boughs, she could yet feel around her the vague\r\nquivering of this ocean of leaves. A strange thrill shot through her\r\nsoul and fleeted across her skin--a strange pain gripped her at the\r\nheart. Why, she did not understand. But it seemed to her that she was\r\nlost, engulfed, surrounded by perils, abandoned by everyone; alone,\r\nalone in the world beneath this living vault quivering there above her.\r\n\r\nShe murmured: \"I am rather frightened. I should like to go back.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, let us do so.\"\r\n\r\n\"And--we will leave for Paris to-morrow?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow morning?\"\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow morning, if you like.\"\r\n\r\nThey returned home. The old folks had gone to bed. She slept badly,\r\ncontinually aroused by all the country sounds so new to her--the cry of\r\nthe screech owl, the grunting of a pig in a sty adjoining the house, and\r\nthe noise of a cock who kept on crowing from midnight. She was up and\r\nready to start at daybreak.\r\n\r\nWhen George announced to his parents that he was going back they were\r\nboth astonished; then they understood the origin of his wish.\r\n\r\nThe father merely said: \"Shall I see you again soon?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, in the course of the summer.\"\r\n\r\n\"So much the better.\"\r\n\r\nThe old woman growled: \"I hope you won't regret what you have done.\"\r\n\r\nHe left them two hundred francs as a present to assuage their\r\ndiscontent, and the carriage, which a boy had been sent in quest of,\r\nhaving made its appearance at about ten o'clock, the newly-married\r\ncouple embraced the old country folk and started off once more.\r\n\r\nAs they were descending the hill Duroy began to laugh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"There,\" he said, \"I had warned you. I ought not to have introduced you\r\nto Monsieur and Madame du Roy de Cantel, Senior.\"\r\n\r\nShe began to laugh, too, and replied: \"I am delighted now. They are good\r\nfolk, whom I am beginning to like very well. I will send them some\r\npresents from Paris.\" Then she murmured: \"Du Roy de Cantel, you will\r\nsee that no one will be astonished at the terms of the notification of\r\nour marriage. We will say that we have been staying for a week with your\r\nparents on their estate.\" And bending towards him she kissed the tip of\r\nhis moustache, saying: \"Good morning, George.\"\r\n\r\nHe replied: \"Good morning, Made,\" as he passed an arm around her waist.\r\n\r\nIn the valley below they could see the broad river like a ribbon of\r\nsilver unrolled beneath the morning sun, the factory chimneys belching\r\nforth their clouds of smoke into the sky, and the pointed spires rising\r\nabove the old town.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Du Roys had been back in Paris a couple of days, and the journalist\r\nhad taken up his old work pending the moment when he should definitely\r\nassume Forestier's duties, and give himself wholly up to politics. He\r\nwas going home that evening to his predecessor's abode to dinner, with a\r\nlight heart and a keen desire to embrace his wife, whose physical\r\nattractions and imperceptible domination exercised a powerful impulse\r\nover him. Passing by a florist's at the bottom of the Rue Notre Dame de\r\nLorette, he was struck by the notion of buying a bouquet for Madeleine,\r\nand chose a large bunch of half-open roses, a very bundle of perfumed\r\nbuds.\r\n\r\nAt each story of his new staircase he eyed himself complacently in the\r\nmirrors, the sight of which continually recalled to him his first visit\r\nto the house. He rang the bell, having forgotten his key, and the same\r\nman-servant, whom he had also kept on by his wife's advice, opened the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n\"Has your mistress come home?\" asked George.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\nBut on passing through the dining-room he was greatly surprised to find\r\nthe table laid for three, and the hangings of the drawing-room door\r\nbeing looped up, saw Madeleine arranging in a vase on the mantelpiece a\r\nbunch of roses exactly similar to his own. He was vexed and displeased;\r\nit was as though he had been robbed of his idea, his mark of attention,\r\nand all the pleasure he anticipated from it.\r\n\r\n\"You have invited some one to dinner, then?\" he inquired, as he entered\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\nShe answered without turning round, and while continuing to arrange the\r\nflowers: \"Yes, and no. It is my old friend, the Count de Vaudrec, who\r\nhas been accustomed to dine here every Monday, and who has come as\r\nusual.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge murmured: \"Ah! very good.\"\r\n\r\nHe remained standing behind her, bouquet in hand, with a longing to hide\r\nit or throw it away. He said, however: \"I have brought you some roses.\"\r\n\r\nShe turned round suddenly, smiling, and exclaimed: \"Ah! how nice of you\r\nto have thought of that.\"\r\n\r\nAnd she held out her arms and lips to him with an outburst of joy so\r\nreal that he felt consoled. She took the flowers, smelt them, and with\r\nthe liveliness of a delighted child, placed them in the vase that\r\nremained empty opposite the other. Then she murmured, as she viewed the\r\nresult: \"How glad I am. My mantelpiece is furnished now.\" She added\r\nalmost immediately, in a tone of conviction: \"You know Vaudrec is\r\nawfully nice; you will be friends with him at once.\"\r\n\r\nA ring announced the Count. He entered quietly, and quite at his ease,\r\nas though at home. After having gallantly kissed the young wife's\r\nfingers, he turned to the husband and cordially held out his hand,\r\nsaying: \"How goes it, my dear Du Roy?\"\r\n\r\nIt was no longer his former stiff and starched bearing, but an affable\r\none, showing that the situation was no longer the same. The journalist,\r\nsurprised, strove to make himself agreeable in response to these\r\nadvances. It might have been believed within five minutes that they had\r\nknown and loved one another for ten years past.\r\n\r\nThen Madeleine, whose face was radiant, said: \"I will leave you\r\ntogether, I must give a look to my dinner.\" And she went out, followed\r\nby a glance from both men. When she returned she found them talking\r\ntheatricals apropos of a new piece, and so thoroughly of the same\r\nopinion that a species of rapid friendship awoke in their eyes at the\r\ndiscovery of this absolute identity of ideas.\r\n\r\nThe dinner was delightful, so intimate and cordial, and the Count stayed\r\non quite late, so comfortable did he feel in this nice little new\r\nhousehold.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he had left Madeleine said to her husband: \"Is he not\r\nperfect? He gains in every way by being known. He is a true\r\nfriend--safe, devoted, faithful. Ah, without him--\"\r\n\r\nShe did not finish the sentence, and George replied: \"Yes, I find him\r\nvery agreeable. I think that we shall get on very well together.\"\r\n\r\nShe resumed: \"You do not know, but we have some work to do together\r\nbefore going to bed. I had not time to speak to you about it before\r\ndinner, because Vaudrec came in at once. I have had some important news,\r\nnews from Morocco. It was Laroche-Mathieu, the deputy, the future\r\nminister, who brought it to me. We must work up an important article, a\r\nsensational one. I have the facts and figures. We will set to work at\r\nonce. Bring the lamp.\"\r\n\r\nHe took it, and they passed into the study. The same books were ranged\r\nin the bookcase, which now bore on its summit the three vases bought at\r\nthe Golfe Juan by Forestier on the eve of his death. Under the table the\r\ndead man's mat awaited the feet of Du Roy, who, on sitting down, took up\r\nan ivory penholder slightly gnawed at the end by the other's teeth.\r\nMadeleine leant against the mantelpiece, and having lit a cigarette\r\nrelated her news, and then explained her notions and the plan of the\r\narticle she meditated. He listened attentively, scribbling notes as he\r\ndid so, and when she had finished, raised objections, took up the\r\nquestion again, enlarged its bearing, and sketched in turn, not the plan\r\nof an article, but of a campaign against the existing Ministry. This\r\nattack would be its commencement. His wife had left off smoking, so\r\nstrongly was her interest aroused, so vast was the vision that opened\r\nbefore her as she followed out George's train of thought.\r\n\r\nShe murmured, from time to time: \"Yes, yes; that is very good. That is\r\ncapital. That is very clever.\"\r\n\r\nAnd when he had finished speaking in turn, she said: \"Now let us write.\"\r\n\r\nBut he always found it hard to make a start, and with difficulty sought\r\nhis expressions. Then she came gently, and, leaning over his shoulder,\r\nbegan to whisper sentences in his ear. From time to time she would\r\nhesitate, and ask: \"Is that what you want to say?\"\r\n\r\nHe answered: \"Yes, exactly.\"\r\n\r\nShe had piercing shafts, the poisoned shafts of a woman, to wound the\r\nhead of the Cabinet, and she blended jests about his face with others\r\nrespecting his policy in a curious fashion, that made one laugh, and, at\r\nthe same time, impressed one by their truth of observation.\r\n\r\nDu Roy from time to time added a few lines which widened and\r\nstrengthened the range of attack. He understood, too, the art of\r\nperfidious insinuation, which he had learned in sharpening up his\r\n\"Echoes\"; and when a fact put forward as certain by Madeleine appeared\r\ndoubtful or compromising, he excelled in allowing it to be divined and\r\nin impressing it upon the mind more strongly than if he had affirmed it.\r\nWhen their article was finished, George read it aloud. They both thought\r\nit excellent, and smiled, delighted and surprised, as if they had just\r\nmutually revealed themselves to one another. They gazed into the depths\r\nof one another's eyes with yearnings of love and admiration, and they\r\nembraced one another with an ardor communicated from their minds to\r\ntheir bodies.\r\n\r\nDu Roy took up the lamp again. \"And now to bye-bye,\" said he, with a\r\n\r\nkindling glance.\r\n\r\nShe replied: \"Go first, sir, since you light the way.\"\r\n\r\nHe went first, and she followed him into their bedroom, tickling his\r\nneck to make him go quicker, for he could not stand that.\r\n\r\nThe article appeared with the signature of George Duroy de Cantel, and\r\ncaused a great sensation. There was an excitement about it in the\r\nChamber. Daddy Walter congratulated the author, and entrusted him with\r\nthe political editorship of the _Vie Francaise_. The \"Echoes\" fell again\r\nto Boisrenard.\r\n\r\nThen there began in the paper a violent and cleverly conducted campaign\r\nagainst the Ministry. The attack, now ironical, now serious, now\r\njesting, and now virulent, but always skillful and based on facts, was\r\ndelivered with a certitude and continuity which astonished everyone.\r\nOther papers continually cited the _Vie Francaise_, taking whole\r\npassages from it, and those in office asked themselves whether they\r\ncould not gag this unknown and inveterate foe with the gift of a\r\nprefecture.\r\n\r\nDu Roy became a political celebrity. He felt his influence increasing by\r\nthe pressure of hands and the lifting of hats. His wife, too, filled him\r\nwith stupefaction and admiration by the ingenuity of her mind, the value\r\nof her information, and the number of her acquaintances. Continually he\r\nwould find in his drawing-room, on returning home, a senator, a deputy,\r\na magistrate, a general, who treated Madeleine as an old friend, with\r\nserious familiarity. Where had she met all these people? In society, so\r\nshe said. But how had she been able to gain their confidence and their\r\naffection? He could not understand it.\r\n\r\n\"She would make a terrible diplomatist,\" he thought.\r\n\r\nShe often came in late at meal times, out of breath, flushed, quivering,\r\nand before even taking off her veil would say: \"I have something good\r\nto-day. Fancy, the Minister of Justice has just appointed two\r\nmagistrates who formed a part of the mixed commission. We will give him\r\na dose he will not forget in a hurry.\"\r\n\r\nAnd they would give the minister a dose, and another the next day, and\r\na third the day after. The deputy, Laroche-Mathieu, who dined at the Rue\r\nFontaine every Tuesday, after the Count de Vaudrec, who began the week,\r\nwould shake the hands of husband and wife with demonstrations of extreme\r\njoy. He never ceased repeating: \"By Jove, what a campaign! If we don't\r\nsucceed after all?\"\r\n\r\nHe hoped, indeed, to succeed in getting hold of the portfolio of foreign\r\naffairs, which he had had in view for a long time.\r\n\r\nHe was one of those many-faced politicians, without strong convictions,\r\nwithout great abilities, without boldness, and without any depth of\r\nknowledge, a provincial barrister, a local dandy, preserving a cunning\r\nbalance between all parties, a species of Republican Jesuit and Liberal\r\nmushroom of uncertain character, such as spring up by hundreds on the\r\npopular dunghill of universal suffrage. His village machiavelism caused\r\nhim to be reckoned able among his colleagues, among all the adventurers\r\nand abortions who are made deputies. He was sufficiently well-dressed,\r\ncorrect, familiar, and amiable to succeed. He had his successes in\r\nsociety, in the mixed, perturbed, and somewhat rough society of the high\r\nfunctionaries of the day. It was said everywhere of him: \"Laroche will\r\nbe a minister,\" and he believed more firmly than anyone else that he\r\nwould be. He was one of the chief shareholders in Daddy Walter's paper,\r\nand his colleague and partner in many financial schemes.\r\n\r\nDu Roy backed him up with confidence and with vague hopes as to the\r\nfuture. He was, besides, only continuing the work begun by Forestier, to\r\nwhom Laroche-Mathieu had promised the Cross of the Legion of Honor when\r\nthe day of triumph should come. The decoration would adorn the breast of\r\nMadeleine's second husband, that was all. Nothing was changed in the\r\nmain.\r\n\r\nIt was seen so well that nothing was changed that Du Roy's comrades\r\norganized a joke against him, at which he was beginning to grow angry.\r\nThey no longer called him anything but Forestier. As soon as he entered\r\nthe office some one would call out: \"I say, Forestier.\"\r\n\r\nHe would pretend not to hear, and would look for the letters in his\r\npigeon-holes. The voice would resume in louder tones, \"Hi! Forestier.\"\r\nSome stifled laughs would be heard, and as Du Roy was entering the\r\nmanager's room, the comrade who had called out would stop him, saying:\r\n\"Oh, I beg your pardon, it is you I want to speak to. It is stupid, but\r\nI am always mixing you up with poor Charles. It is because your articles\r\nare so infernally like his. Everyone is taken in by them.\"\r\n\r\nDu Roy would not answer, but he was inwardly furious, and a sullen wrath\r\nsprang up in him against the dead man. Daddy Walter himself had\r\ndeclared, when astonishment was expressed at the flagrant similarity in\r\nstyle and inspiration between the leaders of the new political editor\r\nand his predecessor: \"Yes, it is Forestier, but a fuller, stronger, more\r\nmanly Forestier.\"\r\n\r\nAnother time Du Roy, opening by chance the cupboard in which the cup and\r\nballs were kept, had found all those of his predecessor with crape round\r\nthe handles, and his own, the one he had made use of when he practiced\r\nunder the direction of Saint-Potin, ornamented with a pink ribbon. All\r\nhad been arranged on the same shelf according to size, and a card like\r\nthose in museums bore the inscription: \"The Forestier-Du Roy (late\r\nForestier and Co.) Collection.\" He quietly closed the cupboard, saying,\r\nin tones loud enough to be heard: \"There are fools and envious people\r\neverywhere.\"\r\n\r\nBut he was wounded in his pride, wounded in his vanity, that touchy\r\npride and vanity of the writer, which produce the nervous susceptibility\r\never on the alert, equally in the reporter and the genial poet. The word\r\n\"Forestier\" made his ears tingle. He dreaded to hear it, and felt\r\nhimself redden when he did so. This name was to him a biting jest, more\r\nthan a jest, almost an insult. It said to him: \"It is your wife who does\r\nyour work, as she did that of the other. You would be nothing without\r\nher.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHe admitted that Forestier would have been no one without Madeleine; but\r\nas to himself, come now!\r\n\r\nThen, at home, the haunting impression continued. It was the whole place\r\nnow that recalled the dead man to him, the whole of the furniture, the\r\nwhole of the knicknacks, everything he laid hands on. He had scarcely\r\nthought of this at the outset, but the joke devised by his comrades had\r\ncaused a kind of mental wound, which a number of trifles, unnoticed up\r\nto the present, now served to envenom. He could not take up anything\r\nwithout at once fancying he saw the hand of Charles upon it. He only\r\nlooked at it and made use of things the latter had made use of formerly;\r\nthings that he had purchased, liked, and enjoyed. And George began even\r\nto grow irritated at the thought of the bygone relations between his\r\nfriend and his wife. He was sometimes astonished at this revolt of his\r\nheart, which he did not understand, and said to himself, \"How the deuce\r\nis it? I am not jealous of Madeleine's friends. I am never uneasy about\r\nwhat she is up to. She goes in and out as she chooses, and yet the\r\nrecollection of that brute of a Charles puts me in a rage.\" He added,\r\n\"At the bottom, he was only an idiot, and it is that, no doubt, that\r\nwounds me. I am vexed that Madeleine could have married such a fool.\"\r\nAnd he kept continually repeating, \"How is it that she could have\r\nstomached such a donkey for a single moment?\"\r\n\r\nHis rancor was daily increased by a thousand insignificant details,\r\nwhich stung him like pin pricks, by the incessant reminders of the other\r\narising out of a word from Madeleine, from the man-servant, from the\r\nwaiting-maid.\r\n\r\nOne evening Du Roy, who liked sweet dishes, said, \"How is it we never\r\nhave sweets at dinner?\"\r\n\r\nHis wife replied, cheerfully, \"That is quite true. I never think about\r\nthem. It is all through Charles, who hated--\"\r\n\r\nHe cut her short in a fit of impatience he was unable to control,\r\nexclaiming, \"Hang it all! I am sick of Charles. It is always Charles\r\nhere and Charles there, Charles liked this and Charles liked that. Since\r\nCharles is dead, for goodness sake leave him in peace.\"\r\n\r\nMadeleine looked at her husband in amazement, without being able to\r\nunderstand his sudden anger. Then, as she was sharp, she guessed what\r\nwas going on within him; this slow working of posthumous jealousy,\r\nswollen every moment by all that recalled the other. She thought it\r\npuerile, may be, but was flattered by it, and did not reply.\r\n\r\nHe was vexed with himself at this irritation, which he had not been\r\nable to conceal. As they were writing after dinner an article for the\r\nnext day, his feet got entangled in the foot mat. He kicked it aside,\r\nand said with a laugh:\r\n\r\n\"Charles was always chilly about the feet, I suppose?\"\r\n\r\nShe replied, also laughing: \"Oh! he lived in mortal fear of catching\r\ncold; his chest was very weak.\"\r\n\r\nDu Roy replied grimly: \"He has given us a proof of that.\" Then kissing\r\nhis wife's hand, he added gallantly: \"Luckily for me.\"\r\n\r\nBut on going to bed, still haunted by the same idea, he asked: \"Did\r\nCharles wear nightcaps for fear of the draughts?\"\r\n\r\nShe entered into the joke, and replied: \"No; only a silk handkerchief\r\ntied round his head.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge shrugged his shoulders, and observed, with contempt, \"What a\r\nbaby.\"\r\n\r\nFrom that time forward Charles became for him an object of continual\r\nconversation. He dragged him in on all possible occasions, speaking of\r\nhim as \"Poor Charles,\" with an air of infinite pity. When he returned\r\nhome from the office, where he had been accosted twice or thrice as\r\nForestier, he avenged himself by bitter railleries against the dead man\r\nin his tomb. He recalled his defects, his absurdities, his littleness,\r\nenumerating them with enjoyment, developing and augmenting them as\r\nthough he had wished to combat the influence of a dreaded rival over the\r\nheart of his wife. He would say, \"I say, Made, do you remember the day\r\nwhen that duffer Forestier tried to prove to us that stout men were\r\nstronger than spare ones?\"\r\n\r\nThen he sought to learn a number of private and secret details\r\nrespecting the departed, which his wife, ill at ease, refused to tell\r\nhim. But he obstinately persisted, saying, \"Come, now, tell me all about\r\nit. He must have been very comical at such a time?\"\r\n\r\nShe murmured, \"Oh! do leave him alone.\"\r\n\r\nBut he went on, \"No, but tell me now, he must have been a duffer to\r\nsleep with?\" And he always wound up with, \"What a donkey he was.\"\r\n\r\nOne evening, towards the end of June, as he was smoking a cigarette at\r\nthe window, the fineness of the evening inspired him with a wish for a\r\ndrive, and he said, \"Made, shall we go as far as the Bois de Boulogne?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly.\"\r\n\r\nThey took an open carriage and drove up the Champs Elysees, and then\r\nalong the main avenue of the Bois de Boulogne. It was a breezeless\r\nnight, one of those stifling nights when the overheated air of Paris\r\nfills the chest like the breath of a furnace. A host of carriages bore\r\nalong beneath the trees a whole population of lovers. They came one\r\nbehind the other in an unbroken line. George and Madeleine amused\r\nthemselves with watching all these couples, the woman in summer toilet\r\nand the man darkly outlined beside her. It was a huge flood of lovers\r\ntowards the Bois, beneath the starry and heated sky. No sound was heard\r\n\r\nsave the dull rumble of wheels. They kept passing by, two by two in each\r\nvehicle, leaning back on the seat, silent, clasped one against the\r\nother, lost in dreams of desire, quivering with the anticipation of\r\ncoming caresses. The warm shadow seemed full of kisses. A sense of\r\nspreading lust rendered the air heavier and more suffocating. All the\r\ncouples, intoxicated with the same idea, the same ardor, shed a fever\r\nabout them.\r\n\r\nGeorge and Madeleine felt the contagion. They clasped hands without a\r\nword, oppressed by the heaviness of the atmosphere and the emotion that\r\nassailed them. As they reached the turning which follows the line of the\r\nfortification, they kissed one another, and she stammered somewhat\r\nconfusedly, \"We are as great babies as on the way to Rouen.\"\r\n\r\nThe great flood of vehicles divided at the entrance of the wood. On the\r\nroad to the lake, which the young couple were following, they were now\r\nthinner, but the dark shadow of the trees, the air freshened by the\r\nleaves and by the dampness arising from the streamlets that could be\r\nheard flowing beneath them, and the coolness of the vast nocturnal vault\r\nbedecked with stars, gave to the kisses of the perambulating pairs a\r\nmore penetrating charm.\r\n\r\nGeorge murmured, \"Dear little Made,\" as he pressed her to him.\r\n\r\n\"Do you remember the forest close to your home, how gloomy it was?\" said\r\nshe. \"It seemed to me that it was full of horrible creatures, and that\r\nthere was no end to it, while here it is delightful. One feels caresses\r\nin the breeze, and I know that Sevres lies on the other side of the\r\nwood.\"\r\n\r\nHe replied, \"Oh! in the forest at home there was nothing but deer,\r\nfoxes, and wild boars, and here and there the hut of a forester.\"\r\n\r\nThis word, akin to the dead man's name, issuing from his mouth,\r\nsurprised him just as if some one had shouted it out to him from the\r\ndepths of a thicket, and he became suddenly silent, assailed anew by\r\nthe strange and persistent uneasiness, and gnawing, invincible, jealous\r\nirritation that had been spoiling his existence for some time past.\r\nAfter a minute or so, he asked: \"Did you ever come here like this of an\r\nevening with Charles?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, often,\" she answered.\r\n\r\nAnd all of a sudden he was seized with a wish to return home, a nervous\r\ndesire that gripped him at the heart. But the image of Forestier had\r\nreturned to his mind and possessed and laid hold of him. He could no\r\nlonger speak or think of anything else and said in a spiteful tone, \"I\r\nsay, Made?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, dear.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you ever cuckold poor Charles?\"\r\n\r\nShe murmured disdainfully, \"How stupid you are with your stock joke.\"\r\n\r\nBut he would not abandon the idea.\r\n\r\n\"Come, Made, dear, be frank and acknowledge it. You cuckolded him, eh?\r\nCome, admit that you cuckolded him?\"\r\n\r\nShe was silent, shocked as all women are by this expression.\r\n\r\nHe went on obstinately, \"Hang it all, if ever anyone had the head for a\r\ncuckold it was he. Oh! yes. It would please me to know that he was one.\r\nWhat a fine head for horns.\" He felt that she was smiling at some\r\nrecollection, perhaps, and persisted, saying, \"Come out with it. What\r\ndoes it matter? It would be very comical to admit that you had deceived\r\nhim, to me.\"\r\n\r\nHe was indeed quivering with hope and desire that Charles, the hateful\r\nCharles, the detested dead, had borne this shameful ridicule. And\r\nyet--yet--another emotion, less definite. \"My dear little Made, tell me,\r\nI beg of you. He deserved it. You would have been wrong not to have\r\ngiven him a pair of horns. Come, Made, confess.\"\r\n\r\nShe now, no doubt, found this persistence amusing, for she was laughing\r\na series of short, jerky laughs.\r\n\r\nHe had put his lips close to his wife's ear and whispered: \"Come, come,\r\nconfess.\"\r\n\r\nShe jerked herself away, and said, abruptly: \"You are crazy. As if one\r\nanswered such questions.\"\r\n\r\nShe said this in so singular a tone that a cold shiver ran through her\r\nhusband's veins, and he remained dumbfounded, scared, almost breathless,\r\nas though from some mental shock.\r\n\r\nThe carriage was now passing along the lake, on which the sky seemed to\r\nhave scattered its stars. Two swans, vaguely outlined, were swimming\r\nslowly, scarcely visible in the shadow. George called out to the driver:\r\n\"Turn back!\" and the carriage returned, meeting the others going at a\r\nwalk, with their lanterns gleaming like eyes in the night.\r\n\r\nWhat a strange manner in which she had said it. Was it a confession? Du\r\nRoy kept asking himself. And the almost certainty that she had deceived\r\nher first husband now drove him wild with rage. He longed to beat her,\r\nto strangle her, to tear her hair out. Oh, if she had only replied: \"But\r\ndarling, if I had deceived him, it would have been with yourself,\" how\r\nhe would have kissed, clasped, worshiped her.\r\n\r\nHe sat still, his arms crossed, his eyes turned skyward, his mind too\r\nagitated to think as yet. He only felt within him the rancor fermenting\r\nand the anger swelling which lurk at the heart of all mankind in\r\npresence of the caprices of feminine desire. He felt for the first time\r\nthat vague anguish of the husband who suspects. He was jealous at last,\r\njealous on behalf of the dead, jealous on Forestier's account, jealous\r\nin a strange and poignant fashion, into which there suddenly entered a\r\nhatred of Madeleine. Since she had deceived the other, how could he have\r\nconfidence in her himself? Then by degrees his mind became calmer, and\r\nbearing up against his pain, he thought: \"All women are prostitutes. We\r\nmust make use of them, and not give them anything of ourselves.\" The\r\nbitterness in his heart rose to his lips in words of contempt and\r\ndisgust. He repeated to himself: \"The victory in this world is to the\r\nstrong. One must be strong. One must be above all prejudices.\"\r\n\r\nThe carriage was going faster. It repassed the fortifications. Du Roy\r\nsaw before him a reddish light in the sky like the glow of an immense\r\nforge, and heard a vast, confused, continuous rumor, made up of\r\ncountless different sounds, the breath of Paris panting this summer\r\nnight like an exhausted giant.\r\n\r\nGeorge reflected: \"I should be very stupid to fret about it. Everyone\r\nfor himself. Fortune favors the bold. Egotism is everything. Egotism as\r\nregards ambition and fortune is better than egotism as regards woman and\r\nlove.\"\r\n\r\nThe Arc de Triomphe appeared at the entrance to the city on its two tall\r\nsupports like a species of shapeless giant ready to start off and march\r\ndown the broad avenue open before him. George and Madeleine found\r\nthemselves once more in the stream of carriages bearing homeward and\r\nbedwards the same silent and interlaced couples. It seemed that the\r\nwhole of humanity was passing by intoxicated with joy, pleasure, and\r\nhappiness. The young wife, who had divined something of what was passing\r\nthrough her husband's mind, said, in her soft voice: \"What are you\r\nthinking of, dear? You have not said a word for the last half hour.\"\r\n\r\nHe answered, sneeringly: \"I was thinking of all these fools cuddling one\r\nanother, and saying to myself that there is something else to do in\r\nlife.\"\r\n\r\nShe murmured: \"Yes, but it is nice sometimes.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is nice--when one has nothing better to do.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge's thoughts were still hard at it, stripping life of its poesy in\r\na kind of spiteful anger. \"I should be very foolish to trouble myself,\r\nto deprive myself of anything whatever, to worry as I have done for some\r\ntime past.\" Forestier's image crossed his mind without causing any\r\nirritation. It seemed to him that they had just been reconciled, that\r\nthey had become friends again. He wanted to cry out: \"Good evening, old\r\nfellow.\"\r\n\r\nMadeleine, to whom this silence was irksome, said: \"Suppose we have an\r\nice at Tortoni's before we go in.\"\r\n\r\nHe glanced at her sideways. Her fine profile was lit up by the bright\r\nlight from the row of gas jets of a cafe. He thought, \"She is pretty.\r\nWell, so much the better. Jack is as good as his master, my dear. But if\r\never they catch me worrying again about you, it will be hot at the North\r\nPole.\" Then he replied aloud: \"Certainly, my dear,\" and in order that\r\nshe should not guess anything, he kissed her.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to the young wife that her husband's lips were frozen. He\r\nsmiled, however, with his wonted smile, as he gave her his hand to\r\nalight in front of the cafe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\n\r\nOn reaching the office next day, Du Roy sought out Boisrenard.\r\n\r\n\"My dear fellow,\" said he, \"I have a service to ask of you. It has been\r\nthought funny for some time past to call me Forestier. I begin to find\r\nit very stupid. Will you have the kindness to quietly let our friends\r\nknow that I will smack the face of the first that starts the joke again?\r\nIt will be for them to reflect whether it is worth risking a sword\r\nthrust for. I address myself to you because you are a calm-minded\r\nfellow, who can hinder matters from coming to painful extremities, and\r\nalso because you were my second.\"\r\n\r\nBoisrenard undertook the commission. Du Roy went out on business, and\r\nreturned an hour later. No one called him Forestier.\r\n\r\nWhen he reached home he heard ladies' voices in the drawing-room, and\r\nasked, \"Who is there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Madame Walter and Madame de Marelle,\" replied the servant.\r\n\r\nHis heart beat fast for a moment, and then he said to himself, \"Well,\r\nlet's see,\" and opened the door.\r\n\r\nClotilde was beside the fireplace, full in a ray of light from the\r\nwindow. It seemed to George that she grew slightly paler on perceiving\r\nhim. Having first bowed to Madame Walter and her two daughters, seated\r\nlike two sentinels on each side of their mother, he turned towards his\r\nlate mistress. She held out her hand, and he took it and pressed it\r\nmeaningly, as though to say, \"I still love you.\" She responded to this\r\npressure.\r\n\r\nHe inquired: \"How have you been during the century that has elapsed\r\nsince our last meeting?\"\r\n\r\nShe replied with perfect ease: \"Quite well; and you, Pretty-boy?\" and\r\nturning to Madeleine, added: \"You will allow me to call him Pretty-boy\r\nstill?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, dear; I will allow whatever you please.\"\r\n\r\nA shade of irony seemed hidden in these words.\r\n\r\nMadame Walter spoke of an entertainment that was going to be given by\r\n\r\nJacques Rival at his residence, a grand assault-at-arms, at which ladies\r\nof fashion were to be present, saying: \"It will be very interesting. But\r\nI am so vexed we have no one to take us there, my husband being obliged\r\nto be away at that time.\"\r\n\r\nDu Roy at once offered his services. She accepted, saying: \"My daughters\r\nand I will be very much obliged to you.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked at the younger daughter, and thought: \"She is not at all bad\r\nlooking, this little Susan; not at all.\" She resembled a fair, fragile\r\n\r\ndoll, too short but slender, with a small waist and fairly developed\r\nhips and bust, a face like a miniature, grayish-blue, enamel-like eyes,\r\nwhich seemed shaded by a careful yet fanciful painter, a polished,\r\ncolorless skin, too white and too smooth, and fluffy, curly hair, in a\r\ncharming aureola, like, indeed the hair of the pretty and expensive\r\ndolls we see in the arms of children much smaller than their plaything.\r\n\r\nThe elder sister, Rose, was ugly, dull-looking, and insignificant; one\r\nof those girls whom you do not notice, do not speak to, and do not talk\r\nabout.\r\n\r\nThe mother rose, and, turning to George, said:\r\n\r\n\"Then I may reckon upon you for next Thursday, two o'clock?\"\r\n\r\n\"You may reckon upon me, madame,\" he replied.\r\n\r\nAs soon as she had taken her departure, Madame de Marelle rose in turn,\r\nsaying: \"Good afternoon, Pretty-boy.\"\r\n\r\nIt was she who then clasped his hand firmly and for some time, and he\r\nfelt moved by this silent avowal, struck again with a sudden caprice for\r\nthis good-natured little, respectable Bohemian of a woman, who really\r\nloved him, perhaps.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he was alone with his wife, Madeleine broke out into a laugh,\r\na frank, gay laugh, and, looking him fair in the face, said, \"You know\r\nthat Madame Walter is smitten with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense,\" he answered, incredulously.\r\n\r\n\"It is so, I tell you; she spoke to me about you with wild enthusiasm.\r\nIt is strange on her part. She would like to find two husbands such as\r\nyou for her daughters. Fortunately, as regards her such things are of no\r\nmoment.\"\r\n\r\nHe did not understand what she meant, and inquired, \"How of no moment?\"\r\n\r\nShe replied with the conviction of a woman certain of the soundness of\r\nher judgment, \"Oh! Madame Walter is one of those who have never even had\r\na whisper about them, never, you know, never. She is unassailable in\r\nevery respect. Her husband you know as well as I do. But with her it is\r\nquite another thing. She has suffered enough through marrying a Jew, but\r\nshe has remained faithful to him. She is an honest woman.\"\r\n\r\nDu Roy was surprised. \"I thought her a Jewess, too,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"She, not at all. She is a lady patroness of all the good works of the\r\nChurch of Madeleine. Her marriage, even, was celebrated religiously. I\r\ndo not know whether there was a dummy baptism as regards the governor,\r\nor whether the Church winked at it.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge murmured: \"Ah! so she fancied me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Positively and thoroughly. If you were not bespoken, I should advise\r\nyou to ask for the hand of--Susan, eh? rather than that of Rose.\"\r\n\r\nHe replied, twisting his moustache: \"Hum; their mother is not yet out of\r\ndate.\"\r\n\r\nMadeleine, somewhat out of patience, answered:\r\n\r\n\"Their mother! I wish you may get her, dear. But I am not alarmed on\r\nthat score. It is not at her age that a woman is guilty of a first\r\nfault. One must set about it earlier.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge was reflecting: \"If it were true, though, that I could have\r\nmarried Susan.\" Then he shrugged his shoulders. \"Bah! it is absurd. As\r\nif her father would have ever have accepted me as a suitor.\"\r\n\r\nHe promised himself, though, to keep a more careful watch in the future\r\nover Madame Walter's bearing towards him, without asking whether he\r\nmight ever derive any advantage from this. All the evening he was\r\nhaunted by the recollection of his love passages with Clotilde,\r\nrecollections at once tender and sensual. He recalled her drolleries,\r\nher pretty ways, and their adventures together. He repeated to himself,\r\n\"She is really very charming. Yes, I will go and see her to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as he had lunched the next morning he indeed set out for the\r\nRue de Verneuil. The same servant opened the door, and with the\r\nfamiliarity of servants of the middle-class, asked: \"Are you quite well,\r\nsir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, thanks, my girl,\" he replied, and entered the drawing-room, in\r\nwhich an unskilled hand could be heard practicing scales on the piano.\r\nIt was Laurine. He thought that she would throw her arms round his neck.\r\nBut she rose gravely, bowed ceremoniously like a grown-up person, and\r\nwithdrew with dignity. She had so much the bearing of an insulted woman\r\nthat he remained in surprise. Her mother came in, and he took and kissed\r\nher hands.\r\n\r\n\"How I have thought of you,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"And I,\" she replied.\r\n\r\nThey sat down and smiled at one another, looking into each other's eyes\r\nwith a longing to kiss.\r\n\r\n\"My dear little Clo, I do love you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I love you, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then--then--you have not been so very angry with me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and no. It hurt me a great deal, but I understood your reasons,\r\nand said to myself, 'He will come back to me some fine day or other.'\"\r\n\r\n\"I dared not come back. I asked myself how I should be received. I did\r\nnot dare, but I dearly wanted to. By the way, tell me what is the matter\r\nwith Laurine. She scarcely said good-morning to me, and went out looking\r\nfurious.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not know. But we cannot speak of you to her since your marriage. I\r\nreally believe she is jealous.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is so, dear. She no longer calls you Pretty-boy, but Monsieur\r\nForestier.\"\r\n\r\nDu Roy reddened, and then drawing close to her said:\r\n\r\n\"Kiss me.\"\r\n\r\nShe did so.\r\n\r\n\"Where can we meet again?\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"Rue de Constantinople.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! the rooms are not let, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I kept them on.\"\r\n\r\n\"You kept them on?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I thought you would come back again.\"\r\n\r\nA gush of joyful pride swelled his bosom. She loved him then, this\r\nwoman, with a real, deep, constant love.\r\n\r\nHe murmured, \"I love you,\" and then inquired, \"Is your husband quite\r\nwell?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, very well. He has been spending a month at home, and was off again\r\nthe day before yesterday.\"\r\n\r\nDu Roy could not help laughing. \"How lucky,\" said he.\r\n\r\nShe replied simply: \"Yes, it is very lucky. But, all the same, he is not\r\ntroublesome when he is here. You know that.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is true. Besides, he is a very nice fellow.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you,\" she asked, \"how do you like your new life?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not much one way or the other. My wife is a companion, a partner.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing more?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing more. As to the heart--\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand. She is pretty, though.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but I do not put myself out about her.\"\r\n\r\nHe drew closer to Clotilde, and whispered. \"When shall we see one\r\nanother again?\"\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow, if you like.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, to-morrow at two o'clock.\"\r\n\r\n\"Two o'clock.\"\r\n\r\nHe rose to take leave, and then stammered, with some embarrassment: \"You\r\nknow I shall take on the rooms in the Rue de Constantinople myself. I\r\nmean it. A nice thing for the rent to be paid by you.\"\r\n\r\nIt was she who kissed his hands adoringly, murmuring: \"Do as you like.\r\nIt is enough for me to have kept them for us to meet again there.\"\r\n\r\nDu Roy went away, his soul filled with satisfaction. As he passed by a\r\nphotographer's, the portrait of a tall woman with large eyes reminded\r\nhim of Madame Walter. \"All the same,\" he said to himself, \"she must be\r\nstill worth looking at. How is it that I never noticed it? I want to see\r\nhow she will receive me on Thursday?\"\r\n\r\nHe rubbed his hands as he walked along with secret pleasure, the\r\npleasure of success in every shape, the egotistical joy of the clever\r\nman who is successful, the subtle pleasure made up of flattered vanity\r\nand satisfied sensuality conferred by woman's affection.\r\n\r\nOn the Thursday he said to Madeleine: \"Are you not coming to the\r\nassault-at-arms at Rival's?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. It would not interest me. I shall go to the Chamber of Deputies.\"\r\n\r\nHe went to call for Madame Walter in an open landau, for the weather was\r\ndelightful. He experienced a surprise on seeing her, so handsome and\r\nyoung-looking did he find her. She wore a light-colored dress, the\r\nsomewhat open bodice of which allowed the fullness of her bosom to be\r\ndivined beneath the blonde lace. She had never seemed to him so\r\nwell-looking. He thought her really desirable. She wore her calm and\r\nladylike manner, a certain matronly bearing that caused her to pass\r\nalmost unnoticed before the eyes of gallants. She scarcely spoke\r\nbesides, save on well-known, suitable, and respectable topics, her ideas\r\nbeing proper, methodical, well ordered, and void of all extravagance.\r\n\r\nHer daughter, Susan, in pink, looked like a newly-varnished Watteau,\r\nwhile her elder sister seemed the governess entrusted with the care of\r\nthis pretty doll of a girl.\r\n\r\nBefore Rival's door a line of carriages were drawn up. Du Roy offered\r\nMadame Walter his arm, and they went in.\r\n\r\nThe assault-at-arms was given under the patronage of the wives of all\r\nthe senators and deputies connected with the _Vie Francaise_, for the\r\nbenefit of the orphans of the Sixth Arrondissement of Paris. Madame\r\nWalter had promised to come with her daughters, while refusing the\r\nposition of lady patroness, for she only aided with her name works\r\nundertaken by the clergy. Not that she was very devout, but her marriage\r\nwith a Jew obliged her, in her own opinion, to observe a certain\r\nreligious attitude, and the gathering organized by the journalist had a\r\nspecies of Republican import that might be construed as anti-clerical.\r\n\r\nIn papers of every shade of opinion, during the past three weeks,\r\nparagraphs had appeared such as: \"Our eminent colleague, Jacques Rival,\r\nhas conceived the idea, as ingenious as it is generous, of organizing\r\nfor the benefit of the orphans of the Sixth Arrondissement of Paris a\r\ngrand assault-at-arms in the pretty fencing-room attached to his\r\napartments. The invitations will be sent out by Mesdames Laloigue,\r\nRemontel, and Rissolin, wives of the senators bearing these names, and\r\nby Mesdames Laroche-Mathieu, Percerol, and Firmin, wives of the\r\nwell-known deputies. A collection will take place during the interval,\r\nand the amount will at once be placed in the hands of the mayor of the\r\nSixth Arrondissement, or of his representative.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a gigantic advertisement that the clever journalist had devised\r\nto his own advantage.\r\n\r\nJacques Rival received all-comers in the hall of his dwelling, where a\r\nrefreshment buffet had been fitted up, the cost of which was to be\r\ndeducted from the receipts. He indicated with an amiable gesture the\r\nlittle staircase leading to the cellar, saying: \"Downstairs, ladies,\r\ndownstairs; the assault will take place in the basement.\"\r\n\r\nHe darted forward to meet the wife of the manager, and then shaking Du\r\nRoy by the hand, said: \"How are you, Pretty-boy?\"\r\n\r\nHis friend was surprised, and exclaimed: \"Who told you that--\"\r\n\r\nRival interrupted him with: \"Madame Walter, here, who thinks the\r\nnickname a very nice one.\"\r\n\r\nMadame Walter blushed, saying: \"Yes, I will admit that, if I knew you\r\nbetter, I would do like little Laurine and call you Pretty-boy, too. The\r\nname suits you very well.\"\r\n\r\nDu Roy laughed, as he replied: \"But I beg of you, madame, to do so.\"\r\n\r\nShe had lowered her eyes, and remarked: \"No. We are not sufficiently\r\nintimate.\"\r\n\r\nHe murmured: \"Will you allow me the hope that we shall be more so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, we will see then,\" said she.\r\n\r\nHe drew on one side to let her precede him at the beginning of the\r\nnarrow stairs lit by a gas jet. The abrupt transition from daylight to\r\nthis yellow gleam had something depressing about it. A cellar-like odor\r\nrose up this winding staircase, a smell of damp heat and of moldy walls\r\nwiped down for the occasion, and also whiffs of incense recalling sacred\r\noffices and feminine emanations of vervain, orris root, and violets. A\r\nloud murmur of voices and the quivering thrill of an agitated crowd\r\ncould also be heard down this hole.\r\n\r\nThe entire cellar was lit up by wreaths of gas jets and Chinese lanterns\r\nhidden in the foliage, masking the walls of stone. Nothing could be seen\r\nbut green boughs. The ceiling was ornamented with ferns, the ground\r\nhidden by flowers and leaves. This was thought charming, and a\r\ndelightful triumph of imagination. In the small cellar, at the end, was\r\na platform for the fencers, between two rows of chairs for the judges.\r\nIn the remaining space the front seats, ranged by tens to the right and\r\nto the left, would accommodate about two hundred people. Four hundred\r\nhad been invited.\r\n\r\nIn front of the platform young fellows in fencing costume, with long\r\nlimbs, erect figures, and moustaches curled up at the ends, were already\r\nshowing themselves off to the spectators. People were pointing them out\r\nas notabilities of the art, professionals, and amateurs. Around them\r\nwere chatting old and young gentlemen in frock coats, who bore a family\r\nresemblance to the fencers in fighting array. They were also seeking to\r\nbe seen, recognized, and spoken of, being masters of the sword out of\r\nuniform, experts on foil play. Almost all the seats were occupied by\r\nladies, who kept up a loud rustling of garments and a continuous murmur\r\nof voices. They were fanning themselves as though at a theater, for it\r\nwas already as hot as an oven in this leafy grotto. A joker kept crying\r\nfrom time to time: \"Orgeat, lemonade, beer.\"\r\n\r\nMadame Walter and her daughters reached the seats reserved for them in\r\nthe front row. Du Roy, having installed them there, was about to quit\r\nthem, saying: \"I am obliged to leave you; we men must not collar the\r\nseats.\"\r\n\r\nBut Madame Walter remarked, in a hesitating tone: \"I should very much\r\nlike to have you with us all the same. You can tell me the names of the\r\nfencers. Come, if you stand close to the end of the seat you will not be\r\nin anyone's way.\" She looked at him with her large mild eyes, and\r\npersisted, saying: \"Come, stay with us, Monsieur--Pretty-boy. We have\r\nneed of you.\"\r\n\r\nHe replied: \"I will obey with pleasure, madame.\"\r\n\r\nOn all sides could be heard the remark: \"It is very funny, this cellar;\r\nvery pretty, too.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge knew it well, this vault. He recalled the morning he had passed\r\nthere on the eve of his duel, alone in front of the little white carton\r\ntarget that had glared at him from the depths of the inner cellar like a\r\nhuge and terrible eye.\r\n\r\nThe voice of Jacques Rival sounded from the staircase: \"Just about to\r\nbegin, ladies.\" And six gentlemen, in very tight-fitting clothes, to set\r\noff their chests, mounted the platform, and took their seats on the\r\nchairs reserved for the judges. Their names flew about. General de\r\nReynaldi, the president, a short man, with heavy moustaches; the\r\n\r\npainter, Josephin Roudet, a tall, ball-headed man, with a long beard;\r\nMattheo de Ujar, Simon Ramoncel, Pierre de Carvin, three\r\nfashionable-looking young fellows; and Gaspard Merleron, a master. Two\r\nplacards were hung up on the two sides of the vault. That on the right\r\nwas inscribed \"M. Crevecoeur,\" and that on the left \"M. Plumeau.\"\r\n\r\nThey were two professors, two good second-class masters. They made their\r\nappearance, both sparely built, with military air and somewhat stiff\r\nmovements. Having gone through the salute with automatic action, they\r\nbegan to attack one another, resembling in their white costumes of\r\nleather and duck, two soldier pierrots fighting for fun. From time to\r\ntime the word \"Touched\" was heard, and the six judges nodded with the\r\nair of connoisseurs. The public saw nothing but two living marionettes\r\nmoving about and extending their arms; they understood nothing, but they\r\nwere satisfied. These two men seemed to them, however, not over\r\ngraceful, and vaguely ridiculous. They reminded them of the wooden\r\nwrestlers sold on the boulevards at the New Year's Fair.\r\n\r\nThe first couple of fencers were succeeded by Monsieur Planton and\r\nMonsieur Carapin, a civilian master and a military one. Monsieur Planton\r\nwas very little, and Monsieur Carapin immensely stout. One would have\r\nthought that the first thrust would have reduced his volume like that of\r\na balloon. People laughed. Monsieur Planton skipped about like a monkey:\r\nMonsieur Carapin, only moved his arm, the rest of his frame being\r\n\r\nparalyzed by fat. He lunged every five minutes with such heaviness and\r\nsuch effort that it seemed to need the most energetic resolution on his\r\npart to accomplish it, and then had great difficulty in recovering\r\nhimself. The connoisseurs pronounced his play very steady and close, and\r\nthe confiding public appreciated it as such.\r\n\r\nThen came Monsieur Porion and Monsieur Lapalme, a master and an amateur,\r\nwho gave way to exaggerated gymnastics; charging furiously at one\r\nanother, obliging the judges to scuttle off with their chairs, crossing\r\nand re-crossing from one end of the platform to the other, one advancing\r\nand the other retreating, with vigorous and comic leaps and bounds. They\r\nindulged in little jumps backwards that made the ladies laugh, and long\r\nsprings forward that caused them some emotion. This galloping assault\r\nwas aptly criticized by some young rascal, who sang out: \"Don't burst\r\nyourselves over it; it is a time job!\" The spectators, shocked at this\r\nwant of taste, cried \"Ssh!\" The judgment of the experts was passed\r\naround. The fencers had shown much vigor, and played somewhat loosely.\r\n\r\nThe first half of the entertainment was concluded by a very fine bout\r\nbetween Jacques Rival and the celebrated Belgian professor, Lebegue.\r\nRival greatly pleased the ladies. He was really a handsome fellow, well\r\nmade, supple, agile, and more graceful than any of those who had\r\npreceded him. He brought, even into his way of standing on guard and\r\nlunging, a certain fashionable elegance which pleased people, and\r\ncontrasted with the energetic, but more commonplace style of his\r\nadversary. \"One can perceive the well-bred man at once,\" was the remark.\r\nHe scored the last hit, and was applauded.\r\n\r\nBut for some minutes past a singular noise on the floor above had\r\ndisturbed the spectators. It was a loud trampling, accompanied by noisy\r\nlaughter. The two hundred guests who had not been able to get down into\r\nthe cellar were no doubt amusing themselves in their own way. On the\r\nnarrow, winding staircase fifty men were packed. The heat down below was\r\ngetting terrible. Cries of \"More air,\" \"Something to drink,\" were heard.\r\nThe same joker kept on yelping in a shrill tone that rose above the\r\nmurmur of conversation, \"Orgeat, lemonade, beer.\" Rival made his\r\nappearance, very flushed, and still in his fencing costume. \"I will have\r\nsome refreshments brought,\" said he, and made his way to the staircase.\r\nBut all communication with the ground floor was cut off. It would have\r\nbeen as easy to have pierced the ceiling as to have traversed the human\r\nwall piled up on the stairs.\r\n\r\nRival called out: \"Send down some ices for the ladies.\" Fifty voices\r\ncalled out: \"Some ices!\" A tray at length made its appearance. But it\r\nonly bore empty glasses, the refreshments having been snatched on the\r\nway.\r\n\r\nA loud voice shouted: \"We are suffocating down here. Get it over and let\r\nus be off.\" Another cried out: \"The collection.\" And the whole of the\r\npublic, gasping, but good-humored all the same, repeated: \"The\r\ncollection, the collection.\"\r\n\r\nSix ladies began to pass along between the seats, and the sound of money\r\nfalling into the collecting-bags could be heard.\r\n\r\nDu Roy pointed out the celebrities to Madame Walter. There were men of\r\nfashion and journalists, those attached to the great newspapers, the\r\nold-established newspapers, which looked down upon the _Vie Francaise_\r\nwith a certain reserve, the fruit of their experience. They had\r\nwitnessed the death of so many of these politico-financial sheets,\r\noffspring of a suspicious partnership, and crushed by the fall of a\r\nministry. There were also painters and sculptors, who are generally men\r\nwith a taste for sport; a poet who was also a member of the Academy, and\r\nwho was pointed out generally, and a number of distinguished foreigners.\r\n\r\nSomeone called out: \"Good-day, my dear fellow.\" It was the Count de\r\nVaudrec. Making his excuses to the ladies, Du Roy hastened to shake\r\nhands with him. On returning, he remarked: \"What a charming fellow\r\nVaudrec is! How thoroughly blood tells in him.\"\r\n\r\nMadame Walter did not reply. She was somewhat fatigued, and her bosom\r\nrose with an effort every time she drew breath, which caught the eye of\r\nDu Roy. From time to time he caught her glance, a troubled, hesitating\r\nglance, which lighted upon him, and was at once averted, and he said to\r\nhimself: \"Eh! what! Have I caught her, too?\"\r\n\r\nThe ladies who had been collecting passed to their seats, their bags\r\nfull of gold and silver, and a fresh placard was hung in front of the\r\nplatform, announcing a \"surprising novelty.\" The judges resumed their\r\nseats, and the public waited expectantly.\r\n\r\nTwo women appeared, foil in hand and in fencing costume; dark tights, a\r\nvery short petticoat half-way to the knee, and a plastron so padded\r\nabove the bosom that it obliged them to keep their heads well up. They\r\nwere both young and pretty. They smiled as they saluted the spectators,\r\nand were loudly applauded. They fell on guard, amidst murmured\r\ngallantries and whispered jokes. An amiable smile graced the lips of the\r\njudges, who approved the hits with a low \"bravo.\" The public warmly\r\nappreciated this bout, and testified this much to the two combatants,\r\nwho kindled desire among the men and awakened among the women the native\r\ntaste of the Parisian for graceful indecency, naughty elegance, music\r\nhall singers, and couplets from operettas. Every time that one of the\r\nfencers lunged a thrill of pleasure ran through the public. The one who\r\nturned her back to the seats, a plump back, caused eyes and mouths to\r\nopen, and it was not the play of her wrist that was most closely\r\nscanned. They were frantically applauded.\r\n\r\nA bout with swords followed, but no one looked at it, for the attention\r\nof all was occupied by what was going on overhead. For some minutes they\r\nhad heard the noise of furniture being dragged across the floor, as\r\nthough moving was in progress. Then all at once the notes of a piano\r\nwere heard, and the rhythmic beat of feet moving in cadence was\r\ndistinctly audible. The people above had treated themselves to a dance\r\nto make up for not being able to see anything. A loud laugh broke out at\r\nfirst among the public in the fencing saloon, and then a wish for a\r\ndance being aroused among the ladies, they ceased to pay attention to\r\nwhat was taking place on the platform, and began to chatter out loud.\r\nThis notion of a ball got up by the late-comers struck them as comical.\r\nThey must be amusing themselves nicely, and it must be much better up\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nBut two new combatants had saluted each other and fell on guard in such\r\nmasterly style that all eyes followed their movements. They lunged and\r\nrecovered themselves with such easy grace, such measured strength, such\r\ncertainty, such sobriety in action, such correctness in attitude, such\r\nmeasure in their play, that even the ignorant were surprised and\r\ncharmed. Their calm promptness, their skilled suppleness, their rapid\r\nmotions, so nicely timed that they appeared slow, attracted and\r\ncaptivated the eye by their power of perfection. The public felt that\r\nthey were looking at something good and rare; that two great artists in\r\ntheir own profession were showing them their best, all of skill,\r\ncunning, thought-out science and physical ability that it was possible\r\nfor two masters to put forth. No one spoke now, so closely were they\r\nwatched. Then, when they shook hands after the last hit, shouts of\r\nbravoes broke out. People stamped and yelled. Everyone knew their\r\nnames--they were Sergent and Ravignac.\r\n\r\nThe excitable grew quarrelsome. Men looked at their neighbors with\r\nlongings for a row. They would have challenged one another on account of\r\na smile. Those who had never held a foil in their hand sketched attacks\r\nand parries with their canes.\r\n\r\nBut by degrees the crowd worked up the little staircase. At last they\r\nwould be able to get something to drink. There was an outburst of\r\nindignation when they found that those who had got up the ball had\r\nstripped the refreshment buffet, and had then gone away declaring that\r\nit was very impolite to bring together two hundred people and not show\r\nthem anything. There was not a cake, not a drop of champagne, syrup, or\r\nbeer left; not a sweetmeat, not a fruit--nothing. They had sacked,\r\npillaged, swept away everything. These details were related by the\r\nservants, who pulled long faces to hide their impulse to laugh right\r\nout. \"The ladies were worse than the gentlemen,\" they asserted, \"and\r\nate and drank enough to make themselves ill.\" It was like the story of\r\nthe survivors after the sack of a captured town.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing left but to depart. Gentlemen openly regretted the\r\ntwenty francs given at the collection; they were indignant that those\r\nupstairs should have feasted without paying anything. The lady\r\npatronesses had collected upwards of three thousand francs. All expenses\r\npaid, there remained two hundred and twenty for the orphans of the Sixth\r\nArrondissement.\r\n\r\nDu Roy, escorting the Walter family, waited for his landau. As he drove\r\nback with them, seated in face of Madame Walter, he again caught her\r\ncaressing and fugitive glance, which seemed uneasy. He thought: \"Hang it\r\nall! I fancy she is nibbling,\" and smiled to recognize that he was\r\nreally very lucky as regarded women, for Madame de Marelle, since the\r\nrecommencement of their amour, seemed frantically in love with him.\r\n\r\nHe returned home joyously. Madeleine was waiting for him in the\r\ndrawing-room.\r\n\r\n\"I have some news,\" said she. \"The Morocco business is getting into a\r\ncomplication. France may very likely send out an expeditionary force\r\nwithin a few months. At all events, the opportunity will be taken of it\r\nto upset the Ministry, and Laroche-Mathieu will profit by this to get\r\nhold of the portfolio of foreign affairs.\"\r\n\r\nDu Roy, to tease his wife, pretended not to believe anything of the\r\nkind. They would never be mad enough to recommence the Tunisian bungle\r\nover again. But she shrugged her shoulders impatiently, saying: \"But I\r\ntell you yes, I tell you yes. You don't understand that it is a matter\r\nof money. Now-a-days, in political complications we must not ask: 'Who\r\nis the woman?' but 'What is the business?'\"\r\n\r\nHe murmured \"Bah!\" in a contemptuous tone, in order to excite her, and\r\nshe, growing irritated, exclaimed: \"You are just as stupid as\r\nForestier.\"\r\n\r\nShe wished to wound him, and expected an outburst of anger. But he\r\nsmiled, and replied: \"As that cuckold of a Forestier?\"\r\n\r\nShe was shocked, and murmured: \"Oh, George!\"\r\n\r\nHe wore an insolent and chaffing air as he said: \"Well, what? Did you\r\nnot admit to me the other evening that Forestier was a cuckold?\" And he\r\nadded: \"Poor devil!\" in a tone of pity.\r\n\r\nMadeleine turned her back on him, disdaining to answer; and then, after\r\na moment's silence, resumed: \"We shall have visitors on Tuesday. Madame\r\nLaroche-Mathieu is coming to dinner with the Viscountess de Percemur.\r\nWill you invite Rival and Norbert de Varenne? I will call to-morrow and\r\nask Madame Walter and Madame de Marelle. Perhaps we shall have Madame\r\nRissolin, too.\"\r\n\r\nFor some time past she had been strengthening her connections, making\r\nuse of her husband's political influence to attract to her house,\r\nwilly-nilly, the wives of the senators and deputies who had need of the\r\nsupport of the _Vie Francaise_.\r\n\r\nGeorge replied: \"Very well. I will see about Rival and Norbert.\"\r\n\r\nHe was satisfied, and rubbed his hands, for he had found a good trick to\r\nannoy his wife and gratify the obscure rancor, the undefined and gnawing\r\njealousy born in him since their drive in the Bois. He would never\r\nspeak of Forestier again without calling him cuckold. He felt very well\r\nthat this would end by enraging Madeleine. And half a score of times, in\r\nthe course of the evening, he found means to mention with ironical good\r\nhumor the name of \"that cuckold of a Forestier.\" He was no longer angry\r\nwith the dead! he was avenging him.\r\n\r\nHis wife pretended not to notice it, and remained smilingly indifferent.\r\n\r\nThe next day, as she was to go and invite Madame Walter, he resolved to\r\nforestall her, in order to catch the latter alone, and see if she really\r\n\r\ncared for him. It amused and flattered him. And then--why not--if it\r\nwere possible?\r\n\r\nHe arrived at the Boulevard Malesherbes about two, and was shown into\r\nthe drawing-room, where he waited till Madame Walter made her\r\nappearance, her hand outstretched with pleased eagerness, saying: \"What\r\ngood wind brings you hither?\"\r\n\r\n\"No good wind, but the wish to see you. Some power has brought me here,\r\nI do not know why, for I have nothing to say to you. I came, here I am;\r\nwill you forgive me this early visit and the frankness of this\r\nexplanation?\"\r\n\r\nHe uttered this in a gallant and jesting tone, with a smile on his lips.\r\nShe was astonished, and colored somewhat, stammering: \"But really--I do\r\nnot understand--you surprise me.\"\r\n\r\nHe observed: \"It is a declaration made to a lively tune, in order not to\r\nalarm you.\"\r\n\r\nThey had sat down in front of one another. She took the matter\r\npleasantly, saying: \"A serious declaration?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. For a long time I have been wanting to utter it--for a very long\r\ntime. But I dared not. They say you are so strict, so rigid.\"\r\n\r\nShe had recovered her assurance, and observed: \"Why to-day, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not know.\" Then lowering his voice he added: \"Or rather, because I\r\nhave been thinking of nothing but you since yesterday.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nShe stammered, growing suddenly pale: \"Come, enough of nonsense; let us\r\nspeak of something else.\"\r\n\r\nBut he had fallen at her feet so suddenly that she was frightened. She\r\ntried to rise, but he kept her seated by the strength of his arms passed\r\nround her waist, and repeated in a voice of passion: \"Yes, it is true\r\nthat I have loved you madly for a long time past. Do not answer me. What\r\nwould you have? I am mad. I love you. Oh! if you knew how I love you!\"\r\n\r\nShe was suffocating, gasping, and strove to speak, without being able to\r\nutter a word. She pushed him away with her two hands, having seized him\r\nby the hair to hinder the approach of the mouth that she felt coming\r\ntowards her own. She kept turning her head from right to left and from\r\nleft to right with a rapid motion, closing her eyes, in order no longer\r\nto see him. He touched her through her dress, handled her, pressed her,\r\nand she almost fainted under his strong and rude caress. He rose\r\nsuddenly and sought to clasp her to him, but, free for a moment, she had\r\nmanaged to escape by throwing herself back, and she now fled from behind\r\none chair to another. He felt that pursuit was ridiculous, and he fell\r\ninto a chair, his face hidden by his hands, feigning convulsive sobs.\r\nThen he got up, exclaimed \"Farewell, farewell,\" and rushed away.\r\n\r\nHe quietly took his stick in the hall and gained the street, saying to\r\nhimself: \"By Jove, I believe it is all right there.\" And he went into a\r\ntelegraph office to send a wire to Clotilde, making an appointment for\r\nthe next day.\r\n\r\nOn returning home at his usual time, he said to his wife: \"Well, have\r\nyou secured all the people for your dinner?\"\r\n\r\nShe answered: \"Yes, there is only Madame Walter, who is not quite sure\r\nwhether she will be free to come. She hesitated and talked about I don't\r\nknow what--an engagement, her conscience. In short, she seemed very\r\nstrange. No matter, I hope she will come all the same.\"\r\n\r\nHe shrugged his shoulders, saying: \"Oh, yes, she'll come.\"\r\n\r\nHe was not certain, however, and remained anxious until the day of the\r\ndinner. That very morning Madeleine received a note from her: \"I have\r\nmanaged to get free from my engagements with great difficulty, and shall\r\nbe with you this evening. But my husband cannot accompany me.\"\r\n\r\nDu Roy thought: \"I did very well indeed not to go back. She has calmed\r\ndown. Attention.\"\r\n\r\nHe, however, awaited her appearance with some slight uneasiness. She\r\ncame, very calm, rather cool, and slightly haughty. He became humble,\r\ndiscreet, and submissive. Madame Laroche-Mathieu and Madame Rissolin\r\naccompanied their husbands. The Viscountess de Percemur talked society.\r\nMadame de Marelle looked charming in a strangely fanciful toilet, a\r\nspecies of Spanish costume in black and yellow, which set off her neat\r\nfigure, her bosom, her rounded arms, and her bird-like head.\r\n\r\nDu Roy had Madame Walter on his right hand, and during dinner only spoke\r\nto her on serious topics, and with an exaggerated respect. From time to\r\ntime he glanced at Clotilde. \"She is really prettier and fresher looking\r\nthan ever,\" he thought. Then his eyes returned to his wife, whom he\r\nfound not bad-looking either, although he retained towards her a hidden,\r\ntenacious, and evil anger.\r\n\r\nBut Madame Walter excited him by the difficulty of victory and by that\r\nnovelty always desired by man. She wanted to return home early. \"I will\r\nescort you,\" said he.\r\n\r\nShe refused, but he persisted, saying: \"Why will not you permit me? You\r\nwill wound me keenly. Do not let me think that you have not forgiven me.\r\nYou see how quiet I am.\"\r\n\r\nShe answered: \"But you cannot abandon your guests like that.\"\r\n\r\nHe smiled. \"But I shall only be away twenty minutes. They will not even\r\nnotice it. If you refuse you will cut me to the heart.\"\r\n\r\nShe murmured: \"Well, then I agree.\"\r\n\r\nBut as soon as they were in the carriage he seized her hand, and,\r\nkissing it passionately, exclaimed: \"I love you, I love you. Let me tell\r\nyou that much. I will not touch you. I only want to repeat to you that I\r\nlove you.\"\r\n\r\nShe stammered: \"Oh! after what you promised me! This is wrong, very\r\nwrong.\"\r\n\r\nHe appeared to make a great effort, and then resumed in a restrained\r\ntone: \"There, you see how I master myself. And yet--But let me only tell\r\nyou that I love you, and repeat it to you every day; yes, let me come to\r\nyour house and kneel down for five minutes at your feet to utter those\r\nthree words while gazing on your beloved face.\"\r\n\r\nShe had yielded her hand to him, and replied pantingly: \"No, I cannot, I\r\nwill not. Think of what would be said, of the servants, of my daughters.\r\nNo, no, it is impossible.\"\r\n\r\nHe went on: \"I can no longer live without seeing you. Whether at your\r\nhouse or elsewhere, I must see you, if only for a moment, every day, to\r\ntouch your hand, to breathe the air stirred by your dress, to gaze on\r\nthe outline of your form, and on your great calm eyes that madden me.\"\r\n\r\nShe listened, quivering, to this commonplace love-song, and stammered:\r\n\"No, it is out of the question.\"\r\n\r\nHe whispered in her ear, understanding that he must capture her by\r\ndegrees, this simple woman, that he must get her to make appointments\r\nwith him, where she would at first, where he wished afterwards. \"Listen,\r\nI must see you; I shall wait for you at your door like a beggar; but I\r\nwill see you, I will see you to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nShe repeated: \"No, do not come. I shall not receive you. Think of my\r\ndaughters.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then tell me where I shall meet you--in the street, no matter where, at\r\nwhatever hour you like, provided I see you. I will bow to you; I will\r\nsay 'I love you,' and I will go away.\"\r\n\r\nShe hesitated, bewildered. And as the brougham entered the gateway of\r\nher residence she murmured hurriedly: \"Well, then, I shall be at the\r\nChurch of the Trinity to-morrow at half-past three.\" Then, having\r\nalighted, she said to her coachman: \"Drive Monsieur Du Roy back to his\r\nhouse.\"\r\n\r\nAs he re-entered his home, his wife said: \"Where did you get to?\"\r\n\r\nHe replied, in a low tone: \"I went to the telegraph office to send off a\r\nmessage.\"\r\n\r\nMadame de Marelle approached them. \"You will see me home, Pretty-boy?\"\r\nsaid she. \"You know I only came such a distance to dinner on that\r\ncondition.\" And turning to Madeleine, she added: \"You are not jealous?\"\r\n\r\nMadame Du Roy answered slowly: \"Not over much.\"\r\n\r\nThe guests were taking their leave. Madame Laroche-Mathieu looked like a\r\nhousemaid from the country. She was the daughter of a notary, and had\r\nbeen married to the deputy when he was only a barrister of small\r\nstanding. Madame Rissolin, old and stuck-up, gave one the idea of a\r\nmidwife whose fashionable education had been acquired through a\r\ncirculating library. The Viscountess de Percemur looked down upon them.\r\nHer \"Lily Fingers\" touched these vulgar hands with repugnance.\r\n\r\nClotilde, wrapped in lace, said to Madeleine as she went out: \"Your\r\ndinner was perfection. In a little while you will have the leading\r\npolitical drawing-room in Paris.\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as she was alone with George she clasped him in her arms,\r\nexclaiming: \"Oh, my darling Pretty-boy, I love you more and more every\r\nday!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Place de la Trinite lay, almost deserted, under a dazzling July sun.\r\nAn oppressive heat was crushing Paris. It was as though the upper air,\r\nscorched and deadened, had fallen upon the city--a thick, burning air\r\nthat pained the chests inhaling it. The fountains in front of the church\r\nfell lazily. They seemed weary of flowing, tired out, limp, too; and the\r\nwater of the basins, in which leaves and bits of paper were floating,\r\nlooked greenish, thick and glaucous. A dog having jumped over the stone\r\nrim, was bathing in the dubious fluid. A few people, seated on the\r\nbenches of the little circular garden skirting the front of the church,\r\nwatched the animal curiously.\r\n\r\nDu Roy pulled out his watch. It was only three o'clock. He was half an\r\nhour too soon. He laughed as he thought of this appointment. \"Churches\r\nserve for anything as far as she is concerned,\" said he to himself.\r\n\"They console her for having married a Jew, enable her to assume an\r\nattitude of protestation in the world of politics and a respectable one\r\nin that of fashion, and serve as a shelter to her gallant rendezvous. So\r\nmuch for the habit of making use of religion as an umbrella. If it is\r\nfine it is a walking stick; if sunshiny, a parasol; if it rains, a\r\nshelter; and if one does not go out, why, one leaves it in the hall. And\r\nthere are hundreds like that who care for God about as much as a cherry\r\nstone, but who will not hear him spoken against. If it were suggested to\r\nthem to go to a hotel, they would think it infamous, but it seems to\r\nthem quite simple to make love at the foot of the altar.\"\r\n\r\nHe walked slowly along the edge of the fountain, and then again looked\r\nat the church clock, which was two minutes faster than his watch. It was\r\nfive minutes past three. He thought that he would be more comfortable\r\ninside, and entered the church. The coolness of a cellar assailed him,\r\nhe breathed it with pleasure, and then took a turn round the nave to\r\nreconnoiter the place. Other regular footsteps, sometimes halting and\r\nthen beginning anew, replied from the further end of the vast pile to\r\nthe sound of his own, which rang sonorously beneath the vaulted roof. A\r\ncuriosity to know who this other promenader was seized him. It was a\r\nstout, bald-headed gentleman who was strolling about with his nose in\r\nthe air, and his hat behind his back. Here and there an old woman was\r\npraying, her face hidden in her hands. A sensation of solitude and rest\r\nstole over the mind. The light, softened by the stained-glass windows,\r\nwas refreshing to the eyes. Du Roy thought that it was \"deucedly\r\ncomfortable\" inside there.\r\n\r\nHe returned towards the door and again looked at his watch. It was still\r\nonly a quarter-past three. He sat down at the entrance to the main\r\naisle, regretting that one could not smoke a cigarette. The slow\r\nfootsteps of the stout gentleman could still be heard at the further end\r\nof the church, near the choir.\r\n\r\nSomeone came in, and George turned sharply round. It was a poor woman in\r\na woolen skirt, who fell on her knees close to the first chair, and\r\nremained motionless, with clasped hands, her eyes turned to heaven, her\r\nsoul absorbed in prayer. Du Roy watched her with interest, asking\r\nhimself what grief, what pain, what despair could have crushed her\r\nheart. She was worn out by poverty, it was plain. She had, perhaps, too,\r\na husband who was beating her to death, or a dying child. He murmured\r\nmentally: \"Poor creatures. How some of them do suffer.\" Anger rose up in\r\nhim against pitiless Nature. Then he reflected that these poor wretches\r\nbelieved, at any rate, that they were taken into consideration up above,\r\nand that they were duly entered in the registers of heaven with a debtor\r\nand creditor balance. Up above! And Du Roy, whom the silence of the\r\nchurch inclined to sweeping reflections, judging creation at a bound,\r\nmuttered contemptuously: \"What bosh all that sort of thing is!\"\r\n\r\nThe rustle of a dress made him start. It was she.\r\n\r\nHe rose, and advanced quickly. She did not hold out her hand, but\r\nmurmured in a low voice: \"I have only a few moments. I must get back\r\nhome. Kneel down near me, so that we may not be noticed.\" And she\r\nadvanced up the aisle, seeking a safe and suitable spot, like a woman\r\nwell acquainted with the place. Her face was hidden by a thick veil, and\r\nshe walked with careful footsteps that could scarcely be heard.\r\n\r\nWhen she reached the choir she turned, and muttered, in that mysterious\r\ntone of voice we always assume in church: \"The side aisles will be\r\nbetter. We are too much in view here.\"\r\n\r\nShe bowed low to the high altar, turned to the right, and returned a\r\nlittle way towards the entrance; then, making up her mind, she took a\r\nchair and knelt down. George took possession of the next one to her, and\r\nas soon as they were in an attitude of prayer, began: \"Thanks; oh,\r\nthanks; I adore you! I should like to be always telling you so, to tell\r\nyou how I began to love you, how I was captivated the first time I saw\r\nyou. Will you allow me some day to open my heart to tell you all this?\"\r\n\r\nShe listened to him in an attitude of deep meditation, as if she heard\r\nnothing. She replied between her fingers: \"I am mad to allow you to\r\nspeak to me like this, mad to have come here, mad to do what I am doing,\r\nmad to let you believe that--that--this adventure can have any issue.\r\nForget all this; you must, and never speak to me again of it.\"\r\n\r\nShe paused. He strove to find an answer, decisive and passionate words,\r\nbut not being able to join action to words, was partially paralyzed. He\r\nreplied: \"I expect nothing, I hope for nothing. I love you. Whatever you\r\nmay do, I will repeat it to you so often, with such power and ardor,\r\nthat you will end by understanding it. I want to make my love penetrate\r\nyou, to pour it into your soul, word by word, hour by hour, day by day,\r\nso that at length it impregnates you like a liquid, falling drop by\r\ndrop; softens you, mollifies you, and obliges you later on to reply to\r\nme: 'I love you, too.'\"\r\n\r\nHe felt her shoulder trembling against him and her bosom throbbing, and\r\nshe stammered, abruptly: \"I love you, too!\"\r\n\r\nHe started as though he had received a blow, and sighed: \"Good God.\"\r\n\r\nShe replied, in panting tones: \"Ought I to have told you that? I feel I\r\nam guilty and contemptible. I, who have two daughters, but I cannot help\r\nit, I cannot help it. I could not have believed, I should never have\r\nthought--but it is stronger than I. Listen, listen: I have never loved\r\nanyone but you; I swear it. And I have loved you for a year past in\r\nsecret, in my secret heart. Oh! I have suffered and struggled till I can\r\ndo so no more. I love you.\"\r\n\r\nShe was weeping, with her hands crossed in front of her face, and her\r\nwhole frame was quivering, shaken by the violence of her emotion.\r\n\r\nGeorge murmured: \"Give me your hand, that I may touch it, that I may\r\npress it.\"\r\n\r\nShe slowly withdrew her hand from her face. He saw her cheek quite wet\r\nand a tear ready to fall on her lashes. He had taken her hand and was\r\npressing it, saying: \"Oh, how I should like to drink your tears!\"\r\n\r\nShe said, in a low and broken voice, which resembled a moan: \"Do not\r\ntake advantage of me; I am lost.\"\r\n\r\nHe felt an impulse to smile. How could he take advantage of her in that\r\nplace? He placed the hand he held upon his heart, saying: \"Do you feel\r\nit beat?\" For he had come to the end of his passionate phrases.\r\n\r\nFor some moments past the regular footsteps of the promenader had been\r\ncoming nearer. He had gone the round of the altars, and was now, for the\r\nsecond time at least, coming down the little aisle on the right. When\r\nMadame Walter heard him close to the pillar which hid her, she snatched\r\nher fingers from George's grasp, and again hid her face. And both\r\nremained motionless, kneeling as though they had been addressing fervent\r\nsupplications to heaven together. The stout gentleman passed close to\r\nthem, cast an indifferent look upon them, and walked away to the lower\r\nend of the church, still holding his hat behind his back.\r\n\r\nDu Roy, who was thinking of obtaining an appointment elsewhere than at\r\nthe Church of the Trinity, murmured: \"Where shall I see you to-morrow?\"\r\n\r\nShe did not answer. She seemed lifeless--turned into a statue of prayer.\r\nHe went on: \"To-morrow, will you let me meet you in the Parc Monseau?\"\r\n\r\nShe turned towards him her again uncovered face, a livid face,\r\ncontracted by fearful suffering, and in a jerky voice ejaculated: \"Leave\r\nme, leave me now; go away, go away, only for five minutes! I suffer too\r\nmuch beside you. I want to pray, and I cannot. Go away, let me pray\r\nalone for five minutes. I cannot. Let me implore God to pardon me--to\r\nsave me. Leave me for five minutes.\"\r\n\r\nHer face was so upset, so full of pain, that he rose without saying a\r\nword, and then, after a little hesitation, asked: \"Shall I come back\r\npresently?\"\r\n\r\nShe gave a nod, which meant, \"Yes, presently,\" and he walked away\r\ntowards the choir. Then she strove to pray. She made a superhuman effort\r\nto invoke the Deity, and with quivering frame and bewildering soul\r\nappealed for mercy to heaven. She closed her eyes with rage, in order no\r\nlonger to see him who just left her. She sought to drive him from her\r\nmind, she struggled against him, but instead of the celestial apparition\r\nawaited in the distress of her heart, she still perceived the young\r\nfellow's curly moustache. For a year past she had been struggling thus\r\nevery day, every night, against the growing possession, against this\r\nimage which haunted her dreams, haunted her flesh, and disturbed her\r\nnights. She felt caught like a beast in a net, bound, thrown into the\r\narms of this man, who had vanquished, conquered her, simply by the hair\r\non his lip and the color of his eyes. And now in this church, close to\r\nGod, she felt still weaker, more abandoned, and more lost than at home.\r\nShe could no longer pray, she could only think of him. She suffered\r\nalready that he had quitted her. She struggled, however, despairingly,\r\nresisted, implored help with all the strength of her soul. She would\r\nliked to have died rather than fall thus, she who had never faltered in\r\nher duty. She murmured wild words of supplication, but she was listening\r\nto George's footsteps dying away in the distance.\r\n\r\nShe understood that it was all over, that the struggle was a useless\r\none. She would not yield, however; and she was seized by one of those\r\nnervous crises that hurl women quivering, yelling, and writhing on the\r\nground. She trembled in every limb, feeling that she was going to fall\r\nand roll among the chairs, uttering shrill cries. Someone approached\r\nwith rapid steps. It was a priest. She rose and rushed towards him,\r\nholding out her clasped hands, and stammering: \"Oh! save me, save me!\"\r\n\r\nHe halted in surprise, saying: \"What is it you wish, madame?\"\r\n\r\n\"I want you to save me. Have pity on me. If you do not come to my\r\nassistance, I am lost.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked at her, asking himself whether she was not mad, and then said:\r\n\"What can I do for you?\"\r\n\r\nHe was a tall, and somewhat stout young man, with full, pendulous\r\ncheeks, dark, with a carefully shaven face, a good-looking city curate\r\nbelonging to a wealthy district, and accustomed to rich penitents.\r\n\r\n\"Hear my confession, and advise me, sustain me, tell me what I am to\r\ndo.\"\r\n\r\nHe replied: \"I hear confessions every Saturday, from three to six\r\no'clock.\"\r\n\r\nHaving seized his arm, she gripped it tightly as she repeated: \"No, no,\r\nno; at once, at once! You must. He is here, in the church. He is waiting\r\nfor me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who is waiting for you?\" asked the priest.\r\n\r\n\"A man who will ruin me, who will carry me off, if you do not save me.\r\nI cannot flee from him. I am too weak--too weak! Oh, so weak, so weak!\"\r\nShe fell at his feet sobbing: \"Oh, have pity on me, father! Save me, in\r\nGod's name, save me!\"\r\n\r\nShe held him by his black gown lest he should escape, and he with\r\nuneasiness glanced around, lest some malevolent or devout eye should see\r\nthis woman fallen at his feet. Understanding at length that he could not\r\nescape, he said: \"Get up; I have the key of the confessional with me.\"\r\n\r\nAnd fumbling in his pocket he drew out a ring full of keys, selected\r\none, and walked rapidly towards the little wooden cabin, dust holes of\r\nthe soul into which believers cast their sins. He entered the center\r\ndoor, which he closed behind him, and Madame Walter, throwing herself\r\ninto the narrow recess at the side, stammered fervently, with a\r\npassionate burst of hope: \"Bless me father, for I have sinned.\"\r\n\r\nDu Roy, having taken a turn round the choir, was passing down the left\r\naisle. He had got half-way when he met the stout, bald gentleman still\r\nwalking quietly along, and said to himself: \"What the deuce is that\r\ncustomer doing here?\"\r\n\r\nThe promenader had also slackened his pace, and was looking at George\r\nwith an evident wish to speak to him. When he came quite close he bowed,\r\nand said in a polite fashion: \"I beg your pardon, sir, for troubling\r\nyou, but can you tell me when this church was built?\"\r\n\r\nDu Roy replied: \"Really, I am not quite certain. I think within the last\r\ntwenty or five-and-twenty years. It is, besides, the first time I ever\r\nwas inside it.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is the same with me. I have never seen it.\"\r\n\r\nThe journalist, whose interest was awakened, remarked: \"It seems to me\r\nthat you are going over it very carefully. You are studying it in\r\ndetail.\"\r\n\r\nThe other replied, with resignation: \"I am not examining it; I am\r\nwaiting for my wife, who made an appointment with me here, and who is\r\nvery much behind time.\" Then, after a few moments' silence, he added:\r\n\"It is fearfully hot outside.\"\r\n\r\nDu Roy looked at him, and all at once fancied that he resembled\r\nForestier.\r\n\r\n\"You are from the country?\" said he, inquiringly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, from Rennes. And you, sir, is it out of curiosity that you entered\r\nthis church?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I am expecting a lady,\" and bowing, the journalist walked away,\r\nwith a smile on his lips.\r\n\r\nApproaching the main entrance, he saw the poor woman still on her knees,\r\nand still praying. He thought: \"By Jove! she keeps hard at it.\" He was\r\nno longer moved, and no longer pitied her.\r\n\r\nHe passed on, and began quietly to walk up the right-hand aisle to find\r\nMadame Walter again. He marked the place where he had left her from a\r\ndistance, astonished at not seeing her. He thought he had made a mistake\r\nin the pillar; went on as far as the end one, and then returned. She had\r\ngone, then. He was surprised and enraged. Then he thought she might be\r\nlooking for him, and made the circuit of the church again. Not finding\r\nher, he returned, and sat down on the chair she had occupied, hoping she\r\nwould rejoin him there, and waited. Soon a low murmur of voices aroused\r\nhis attention. He had not seen anyone in that part of the church. Whence\r\ncame this whispering? He rose to see, and perceived in the adjacent\r\nchapel the doors of the confessional. The skirt of a dress issuing from\r\none of these trailed on the pavement. He approached to examine the\r\nwoman. He recognized her. She was confessing.\r\n\r\nHe felt a violent inclination to take her by the shoulders and to pull\r\nher out of the box. Then he thought: \"Bah! it is the priest's turn now;\r\nit will be mine to-morrow.\" And he sat down quietly in front of the\r\nconfessional, biding his time, and chuckling now over the adventure. He\r\nwaited a long time. At length Madame Walter rose, turned round, saw him,\r\nand came up to him. Her expression was cold and severe, \"Sir,\" said she,\r\n\"I beg of you not to accompany me, not to follow me, and not to come to\r\nmy house alone. You will not be received. Farewell.\"\r\n\r\nAnd she walked away with a dignified bearing. He let her depart, for one\r\nof his principles was never to force matters. Then, as the priest,\r\nsomewhat upset, issued in turn from his box, he walked up to him, and,\r\nlooking him straight in the eyes, growled to his face: \"If you did not\r\nwear a petticoat, what a smack you would get across your ugly chops.\"\r\nAfter which he turned on his heels and went out of the church, whistling\r\nbetween his teeth. Standing under the porch, the stout gentleman, with\r\nthe hat on his head and his hands behind his back, tired of waiting, was\r\nscanning the broad squares and all the streets opening onto it. As Du\r\nRoy passed him they bowed to one another.\r\n\r\nThe journalist, finding himself at liberty, went to the office of the\r\n_Vie Francaise_. As soon as he entered he saw by the busy air of the\r\nmessengers that something out of the common was happening, and at once\r\nwent into the manager's room. Daddy Walter, in a state of nervous\r\nexcitement, was standing up dictating an article in broken sentences;\r\nissuing orders to the reporters, who surrounded him, between two\r\nparagraphs; giving instructions to Boisrenard; and opening letters.\r\n\r\nAs Du Roy came in, the governor uttered a cry of joy: \"Ah! how lucky;\r\nhere is Pretty-boy!\" He stopped short, somewhat confused, and excused\r\nhimself: \"I beg your pardon for speaking like that, but I am very much\r\ndisturbed by certain events. And then I hear my wife and daughter\r\nspeaking of you as Pretty-boy from morning till night, and have ended by\r\nfalling into the habit myself. You are not offended?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all!\" said George, laughingly; \"there is nothing in that\r\nnickname to displease me.\"\r\n\r\nDaddy Walter went on: \"Very well, then, I christen you Pretty-boy, like\r\neveryone else. Well, the fact is, great things are taking place. The\r\nMinistry has been overthrown by a vote of three hundred and ten to a\r\nhundred and two. Our prorogation is again postponed--postponed to the\r\nGreek calends, and here we are at the twenty-eighth of July. Spain is\r\nangry about the Morocco business, and it is that which has overthrown\r\nDurand de l'Aine and his following. We are right in the swim. Marrot is\r\nentrusted with the formation of a new Cabinet. He takes General Boutin\r\nd'Acre as minister of war, and our friend Laroche-Mathieu for foreign\r\naffairs. We are going to become an official organ. I am writing a\r\nleader, a simple declaration of our principles, pointing out the line to\r\nbe followed by the Ministry.\" The old boy smiled, and continued: \"The\r\nline they intend following, be it understood. But I want something\r\ninteresting about Morocco; an actuality; a sensational article;\r\nsomething or other. Find one for me.\"\r\n\r\nDu Roy reflected for a moment, and then replied: \"I have the very thing\r\nfor you. I will give you a study of the political situation of the whole\r\nof our African colony, with Tunis on the left, Algeria in the middle,\r\nand Morocco on the right; the history of the races inhabiting this vast\r\nextent of territory; and the narrative of an excursion on the frontier\r\nof Morocco to the great oasis of Figuig, where no European has\r\npenetrated, and which is the cause of the present conflict. Will that\r\nsuit you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Admirably!\" exclaimed Daddy Walter. \"And the title?\"\r\n\r\n\"From Tunis to Tangiers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Splendid!\"\r\n\r\nDu Roy went off to search the files of the _Vie Francaise_ for his first\r\narticle, \"The Recollections of a Chasseur d'Afrique,\" which, rebaptized,\r\ntouched up, and modified, would do admirably, since it dealt with\r\ncolonial policy, the Algerian population, and an excursion in the\r\nprovince of Oran. In three-quarters of an hour it was rewritten, touched\r\nup, and brought to date, with a flavor of realism, and praises of the\r\nnew Cabinet. The manager, having read the article, said: \"It is capital,\r\ncapital, capital! You are an invaluable fellow. I congratulate you.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Du Roy went home to dinner delighted with his day's work, despite\r\nthe check at the Church of the Trinity, for he felt the battle won. His\r\nwife was anxiously waiting for him. She exclaimed, as soon as she saw\r\nhim: \"Do you know that Laroche-Mathieu is Minister for Foreign Affairs?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; I have just written an article on Algeria, in connection with\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"You know, the first we wrote together, 'The Recollections of a Chasseur\r\nd'Afrique,' revised and corrected for the occasion.\"\r\n\r\nShe smiled, saying: \"Ah, that is very good!\" Then, after a few moments'\r\nreflection, she continued: \"I was thinking--that continuation you were\r\nto have written then, and that you--put off. We might set to work on it\r\nnow. It would make a nice series, and very appropriate to the\r\nsituation.\"\r\n\r\nHe replied, sitting down to table: \"Exactly, and there is nothing in the\r\nway of it now that cuckold of a Forestier is dead.\"\r\n\r\nShe said quietly, in a dry and hurt tone: \"That joke is more than out of\r\nplace, and I beg of you to put an end to it. It has lasted too long\r\nalready.\"\r\n\r\nHe was about to make an ironical answer, when a telegram was brought\r\nhim, containing these words: \"I had lost my senses. Forgive me, and come\r\nat four o'clock to-morrow to the Parc Monceau.\"\r\n\r\nHe understood, and with heart suddenly filled with joy, he said to his\r\nwife, as he slipped the message into his pocket: \"I will not do so any\r\nmore, darling; it was stupid, I admit.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he began his dinner. While eating he kept repeating to himself the\r\n\r\nwords: \"I had lost my senses. Forgive me, and come at four o'clock\r\nto-morrow to the Parc Monceau.\" So she was yielding. That meant: \"I\r\nsurrender, I am yours when you like and where you like.\" He began to\r\nlaugh, and Madeleine asked: \"What is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing,\" he answered; \"I was thinking of a priest I met just now, and\r\nwho had a very comical mug.\"\r\n\r\nDu Roy arrived to the time at the appointed place next day. On the\r\nbenches of the park were seated citizens overcome by heat, and careless\r\nnurses, who seemed to be dreaming while their children were rolling on\r\nthe gravel of the paths. He found Madame Walter in the little antique\r\nruins from which a spring flows. She was walking round the little circle\r\nof columns with an uneasy and unhappy air. As soon as he had greeted\r\nher, she exclaimed: \"What a number of people there are in the garden.\"\r\n\r\nHe seized the opportunity: \"It is true; will you come somewhere else?\"\r\n\r\n\"But where?\"\r\n\r\n\"No matter where; in a cab, for instance. You can draw down the blind on\r\nyour side, and you will be quite invisible.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I prefer that; here I am dying with fear.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, come and meet me in five minutes at the gate opening onto the\r\nouter boulevard. I will have a cab.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he darted off.\r\n\r\nAs soon as she had rejoined him, and had carefully drawn down the blind\r\non her side, she asked: \"Where have you told the driver to take us?\"\r\n\r\nGeorge replied: \"Do not trouble yourself, he knows what to do.\"\r\n\r\nHe had given the man his address in the Rue de Constantinople.\r\n\r\nShe resumed: \"You cannot imagine what I suffer on account of you, how I\r\nam tortured and tormented. Yesterday, in the church, I was cruel, but I\r\nwanted to flee from you at any cost. I was so afraid to find myself\r\nalone with you. Have you forgiven me?\"\r\n\r\nHe squeezed her hands: \"Yes, yes, what would I not forgive you, loving\r\nyou as I do?\"\r\n\r\nShe looked at him with a supplicating air: \"Listen, you must promise to\r\nrespect me--not to--not to--otherwise I cannot see you again.\"\r\n\r\nHe did not reply at once; he wore under his moustache that keen smile\r\nthat disturbed women. He ended by murmuring: \"I am your slave.\"\r\n\r\nThen she began to tell him how she had perceived that she was in love\r\nwith him on learning that he was going to marry Madeleine Forestier. She\r\ngave details, little details of dates and the like. Suddenly she paused.\r\nThe cab had stopped. Du Roy opened the door.\r\n\r\n\"Where are we?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Get out and come into this house,\" he replied. \"We shall be more at\r\nease there.\"\r\n\r\n\"But where are we?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"At my rooms,\" and here we will leave them to their _tete-a-tete_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\n\r\nAutumn had come. The Du Roys had passed the whole of the summer in\r\nParis, carrying on a vigorous campaign in the _Vie Francaise_ during the\r\nshort vacation of the deputies.\r\n\r\nAlthough it was only the beginning of October, the Chambers were about\r\nto resume their sittings, for matters as regarded Morocco were becoming\r\nthreatening. No one at the bottom believed in an expedition against\r\nTangiers, although on the day of the prorogation of the Chamber, a\r\ndeputy of the Right, Count de Lambert-Serrazin, in a witty speech,\r\napplauded even by the Center had offered to stake his moustache, after\r\nthe example of a celebrated Viceroy of the Indies, against the whiskers\r\nof the President of the Council, that the new Cabinet could not help\r\nimitating the old one, and sending an army to Tangiers, as a pendant to\r\nthat of Tunis, out of love of symmetry, as one puts two vases on a\r\nfireplace.\r\n\r\nHe had added: \"Africa is indeed, a fireplace for France, gentleman--a\r\nfireplace which consumes our best wood; a fireplace with a strong\r\ndraught, which is lit with bank notes. You have had the artistic fancy\r\nof ornamenting the left-hand corner with a Tunisian knick-knack which\r\nhad cost you dear. You will see that Monsieur Marrot will want to\r\nimitate his predecessor, and ornament the right-hand corner with one\r\nfrom Morocco.\"\r\n\r\nThis speech, which became famous, served as a peg for Du Roy for a half\r\na score of articles upon the Algerian colony--indeed, for the entire\r\nseries broken short off after his _debut_ on the paper. He had\r\nenergetically supported the notion of a military expedition, although\r\nconvinced that it would not take place. He had struck the chord of\r\npatriotism, and bombarded Spain with the entire arsenal of contemptuous\r\narguments which we make use of against nations whose interests are\r\ncontrary to our own. The _Vie Francaise_ had gained considerable\r\nimportance through its own connection with the party in office. It\r\npublished political intelligence in advance of the most important\r\npapers, and hinted discreetly the intentions of its friends the\r\nMinistry, so that all the papers of Paris and the provinces took their\r\nnews from it. It was quoted and feared, and people began to respect it.\r\nIt was no longer the suspicious organ of a knot of political jugglers,\r\nbut the acknowledged one of the Cabinet. Laroche-Mathieu was the soul of\r\nthe paper, and Du Roy his mouthpiece. Daddy Walter, a silent member and\r\na crafty manager, knowing when to keep in the background, was busying\r\nhimself on the quiet, it is said, with an extensive transaction with\r\nsome copper mines in Morocco.\r\n\r\nMadeleine's drawing-room had been an influential center, in which\r\nseveral members of the Cabinet met every week. The President of the\r\nCouncil had even dined twice at her house, and the wives of the\r\nstatesmen who had formerly hesitated to cross her threshold now boasted\r\nof being her friends, and paid her more visits than were returned by\r\nher. The Minister for Foreign Affairs reigned almost as a master in the\r\nhousehold. He called at all hours, bringing dispatches, news, items of\r\ninformation, which he dictated either to the husband or the wife, as if\r\nthey had been his secretaries.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Du Roy, after the minister's departure, found himself alone with\r\nMadeleine, he would break out in a menacing tone with bitter\r\ninsinuations against the goings-on of this commonplace parvenu.\r\n\r\nBut she would shrug her shoulders contemptuously, repeating: \"Do as much\r\nas he has done yourself. Become a minister, and you can have your own\r\nway. Till then, hold your tongue.\"\r\n\r\nHe twirled his moustache, looking at her askance: \"People do not know of\r\nwhat I am capable,\" he said, \"They will learn it, perhaps, some day.\"\r\n\r\nShe replied, philosophically: \"Who lives long enough will see it.\"\r\n\r\nThe morning on which the Chambers reassembled the young wife, still in\r\nbed, was giving a thousand recommendations to her husband, who was\r\ndressing himself in order to lunch with M. Laroche-Mathieu, and receive\r\nhis instructions prior to the sitting for the next day's political\r\nleader in the _Vie Francaise_, this leader being meant to be a kind of\r\nsemi-official declaration of the real objects of the Cabinet.\r\n\r\nMadeleine was saying: \"Above all, do not forget to ask him whether\r\nGeneral Belloncle is to be sent to Oran, as has been reported. That\r\nwould mean a great deal.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge replied irritably: \"But I know just as well as you what I have to\r\ndo. Spare me your preaching.\"\r\n\r\nShe answered quietly: \"My dear, you always forget half the commissions I\r\nentrust you with for the minister.\"\r\n\r\nHe growled: \"He worries me to death, that minister of yours. He is a\r\nnincompoop.\"\r\n\r\nShe remarked quietly: \"He is no more my minister than he is yours. He is\r\nmore useful to you than to me.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned half round towards her, saying, sneeringly: \"I beg your\r\npardon, but he does not pay court to me.\"\r\n\r\nShe observed slowly: \"Nor to me either; but he is making our fortune.\"\r\n\r\nHe was silent for a few moments, and then resumed: \"If I had to make a\r\nchoice among your admirers, I should still prefer that old fossil De\r\nVaudrec. What has become of him, I have not seen him for a week?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is unwell,\" replied she, unmoved. \"He wrote to me that he was even\r\nobliged to keep his bed from an attack of gout. You ought to call and\r\nask how he is. You know he likes you very well, and it would please\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge said: \"Yes, certainly; I will go some time to-day.\"\r\n\r\nHe had finished his toilet, and, hat on head, glanced at himself in the\r\nglass to see if he had neglected anything. Finding nothing, he came up\r\nto the bed and kissed his wife on the forehead, saying: \"Good-bye, dear,\r\nI shall not be in before seven o'clock at the earliest.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he went out. Monsieur Laroche-Mathieu was awaiting him, for he was\r\nlunching at ten o'clock that morning, the Council having to meet at\r\nnoon, before the opening of Parliament. As soon as they were seated at\r\ntable alone with the minister's private secretary, for Madame\r\nLaroche-Mathieu had been unwilling to change her own meal times, Du Roy\r\nspoke of his article, sketched out the line he proposed to take,\r\nconsulting notes scribbled on visiting cards, and when he had finished,\r\nsaid: \"Is there anything you think should be modified, my dear\r\nminister?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very little, my dear fellow. You are perhaps a trifle too strongly\r\naffirmative as regards the Morocco business. Speak of the expedition as\r\nif it were going to take place; but, at the same time, letting it be\r\nunderstood that it will not take place, and that you do not believe in\r\nit in the least in the world. Write in such a way that the public can\r\neasily read between the lines that we are not going to poke our noses\r\ninto that adventure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite so. I understand, and I will make myself thoroughly understood.\r\nMy wife commissioned me to ask you, on this point, whether General\r\nBelloncle will be sent to Oran. After what you have said, I conclude he\r\nwill not.\"\r\n\r\nThe statesman answered, \"No.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThen they spoke of the coming session. Laroche-Mathieu began to spout,\r\nrehearsing the phrases that he was about to pour forth on his colleagues\r\na few hours later. He waved his right hand, raising now his knife, now\r\nhis fork, now a bit of bread, and without looking at anyone, addressing\r\nhimself to the invisible assembly, he poured out his dulcet eloquence,\r\nthe eloquence of a good-looking, dandified fellow. A tiny, twisted\r\nmoustache curled up at its two ends above his lip like scorpion's tails,\r\nand his hair, anointed with brilliantine and parted in the middle, was\r\npuffed out like his temples, after the fashion of a provincial\r\nlady-killer. He was a little too stout, puffy, though still young, and\r\nhis stomach stretched his waistcoat.\r\n\r\nThe private secretary ate and drank quietly, no doubt accustomed to\r\nthese floods of loquacity; but Du Roy, whom jealousy of achieved success\r\ncut to the quick, thought: \"Go on you proser. What idiots these\r\npolitical jokers are.\" And comparing his own worth to the frothy\r\nimportance of the minister, he said to himself, \"By Jove! if I had only\r\na clear hundred thousand francs to offer myself as a candidate at home,\r\nnear Rouen, and dish my sunning dullards of Normandy folk in their own\r\nsauce, what a statesman I should make beside these short-sighted\r\nrascals!\"\r\n\r\nMonsieur Laroche-Mathieu went on spouting until coffee was served; then,\r\nseeing that he was behind hand, he rang for his brougham, and holding\r\nout his hand to the journalist, said: \"You quite understand, my dear\r\nfellow?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perfectly, my dear minister; you may rely upon me.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Du Roy strolled leisurely to the office to begin his article, for he\r\nhad nothing to do till four o'clock. At four o'clock he was to meet, at\r\nthe Rue de Constantinople, Madame de Marelle, whom he met there\r\nregularly twice a week--on Mondays and Fridays. But on reaching the\r\noffice a telegram was handed to him. It was from Madame Walter, and ran\r\nas follows: \"I must see you to-day. Most important. Expect me at two\r\no'clock, Rue de Constantinople. Can render you a great service. Till\r\ndeath.--Virginie.\"\r\n\r\nHe began to swear: \"Hang it all, what an infernal bore!\" And seized with\r\na fit of ill-temper, he went out again at once too irritated to work.\r\n\r\nFor six weeks he had been trying to break off with her, without being\r\nable to wear out her eager attachment. She had had, after her fall, a\r\nfrightful fit of remorse, and in three successive rendezvous had\r\noverwhelmed her lover with reproaches and maledictions. Bored by these\r\nscenes and already tired of this mature and melodramatic conquest, he\r\nhad simply kept away, hoping to put an end to the adventure in that way.\r\nBut then she had distractedly clutched on to him, throwing herself into\r\nthis amour as a man throws himself into a river with a stone about his\r\nneck. He had allowed himself to be recaptured out of weakness and\r\nconsideration for her, and she had enwrapt him in an unbridled and\r\nfatiguing passion, persecuting him with her affection. She insisted on\r\nseeing him every day, summoning him at all hours to a hasty meeting at a\r\nstreet corner, at a shop, or in a public garden. She would then repeat\r\nto him in a few words, always the same, that she worshiped and idolized\r\nhim, and leave him, vowing that she felt so happy to have seen him. She\r\nshowed herself quite another creature than he had fancied her, striving\r\nto charm him with puerile glances, a childishness in love affairs\r\nridiculous at her age. Having remained up till then strictly honest,\r\nvirgin in heart, inaccessible to all sentiment, ignorant of sensuality,\r\na strange outburst of youthful tenderness, of ardent, naive and tardy\r\nlove, made up of unlooked-for outbursts, exclamations of a girl of\r\nsixteen, graces grown old without ever having been young, had taken\r\nplace in this staid woman. She wrote him ten letters a day, maddeningly\r\nfoolish letters, couched in a style at once poetic and ridiculous, full\r\nof the pet names of birds and beasts.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they found themselves alone together she would kiss him with\r\nthe awkward prettiness of a great tomboy, pouting of the lips that were\r\ngrotesque, and bounds that made her too full bosom shake beneath her\r\nbodice. He was above all, sickened with hearing her say, \"My pet,\" \"My\r\ndoggie,\" \"My jewel,\" \"My birdie,\" \"My treasure,\" \"My own,\" \"My\r\nprecious,\" and to see her offer herself to him every time with a little\r\ncomedy of infantile modesty, little movements of alarm that she thought\r\npretty, and the tricks of a depraved schoolgirl. She would ask, \"Whose\r\nmouth is this?\" and when he did not reply \"Mine,\" would persist till she\r\nmade him grow pale with nervous irritability. She ought to have felt, it\r\nseemed to him, that in love extreme tact, skill, prudence, and exactness\r\nare requisite; that having given herself to him, she, a woman of mature\r\nyears, the mother of a family, and holding a position in society, should\r\nyield herself gravely, with a kind of restrained eagerness, with tears,\r\nperhaps, but with those of Dido, not of Juliet.\r\n\r\nShe kept incessantly repeating to him, \"How I love you, my little pet.\r\nDo you love me as well, baby?\"\r\n\r\nHe could no longer bear to be called \"my little pet,\" or \"baby,\" without\r\nan inclination to call her \"old girl.\"\r\n\r\nShe would say to him, \"What madness of me to yield to you. But I do not\r\nregret it. It is so sweet to love.\"\r\n\r\nAll this seemed to George irritating from her mouth. She murmured, \"It\r\nis so sweet to love,\" like the village maiden at a theater.\r\n\r\nThen she exasperated him by the clumsiness of her caresses. Having\r\nbecome all at once sensual beneath the kisses of this young fellow who\r\nhad so warmed her blood, she showed an unskilled ardor and a serious\r\napplication that made Du Roy laugh and think of old men trying to learn\r\nto read. When she would have gripped him in her embrace, ardently gazing\r\nat him with the deep and terrible glance of certain aging women,\r\nsplendid in their last loves, when she should have bitten him with\r\nsilent and quivering mouth, crushing him beneath her warmth and weight,\r\nshe would wriggle about like a girl, and lisp with the idea of being\r\npleasant: \"Me love 'ou so, ducky, me love 'ou so. Have nice lovey-lovey\r\nwith 'ittle wifey.\"\r\n\r\nHe then would be seized with a wild desire to take his hat and rush out,\r\nslamming the door behind him.\r\n\r\nThey had frequently met at the outset at the Rue de Constantinople; but\r\nDu Roy, who dreaded a meeting there with Madame de Marelle, now found a\r\nthousand pretexts for refusing such appointments. He had then to call on\r\nher almost every day at her home, now to lunch, now to dinner. She\r\nsqueezed his hand under the table, held out her mouth to him behind the\r\ndoors. But he, for his part, took pleasure above all in playing with\r\nSusan, who amused him with her whimsicalities. In her doll-like frame\r\nwas lodged an active, arch, sly, and startling wit, always ready to show\r\nitself off. She joked at everything and everybody with biting readiness.\r\nGeorge stimulated her imagination, excited it to irony and they\r\nunderstood one another marvelously. She kept appealing to him every\r\nmoment, \"I say, Pretty-boy. Come here, Pretty-boy.\"\r\n\r\nHe would at once leave the mother and go to the daughter, who would\r\nwhisper some bit of spitefulness, at which they would laugh heartily.\r\n\r\nHowever, disgusted with the mother's love, he began to feel an\r\ninsurmountable repugnance for her; he could no longer see, hear, or\r\nthink of her without anger. He ceased, therefore, to visit her, to\r\nanswer her letters, or to yield to her appeals. She understood at length\r\nthat he no longer loved her, and suffered terribly. But she grew\r\ninsatiable, kept watch on him, followed him, waited for him in a cab\r\nwith the blinds drawn down, at the door of the office, at the door of\r\nhis dwelling, in the streets through which she hoped he might pass. He\r\nlonged to ill-treat her, swear at her, strike her, say to her plainly,\r\n\"I have had enough of it, you worry my life out.\" But he observed some\r\ncircumspection on account of the _Vie Francaise_, and strove by dint of\r\ncoolness, harshness, tempered by attention, and even rude words at\r\ntimes, to make her understand that there must be an end to it. She\r\nstrove, above all, to devise schemes to allure him to a meeting in the\r\nRue de Constantinople, and he was in a perpetual state of alarm lest the\r\ntwo women should find themselves some day face to face at the door.\r\n\r\nHis affection for Madame de Marelle had, on the contrary, augmented\r\nduring the summer. He called her his \"young rascal,\" and she certainly\r\ncharmed him. Their two natures had kindred links; they were both members\r\nof the adventurous race of vagabonds, those vagabonds in society who so\r\nstrongly resemble, without being aware of it, the vagabonds of the\r\nhighways. They had had a summer of delightful love-making, a summer of\r\nstudents on the spree, bolting off to lunch or dine at Argenteuil,\r\nBougival, Maisons, or Poissy, and passing hours in a boat gathering\r\nflowers from the bank. She adored the fried fish served on the banks of\r\nthe Seine, the stewed rabbits, the arbors in the tavern gardens, and the\r\nshouts of the boating men. He liked to start off with her on a bright\r\nday on a suburban line, and traverse the ugly environs of Paris,\r\nsprouting with tradesmen's hideous boxes, talking lively nonsense. And\r\nwhen he had to return to dine at Madame Walter's he hated the eager old\r\nmistress from the mere recollection of the young one whom he had left,\r\nand who had ravished his desires and harvested his ardor among the grass\r\nby the water side.\r\n\r\nHe had fancied himself at length pretty well rid of Madame Walter, to\r\nwhom he had expressed, in a plain and almost brutal fashion, his\r\nintentions of breaking off with her, when he received at the office of\r\nthe paper the telegram summoning him to meet her at two o'clock at the\r\nRue de Constantinople. He re-read it as he walked along, \"Must see you\r\nto-day. Most important. Expect me two o'clock, Rue de Constantinople.\r\nCan render you a great service. Till death.--Virginie.\"\r\n\r\nHe thought, \"What does this old screech-owl want with me now? I wager\r\nshe has nothing to tell me. She will only repeat that she adores me. Yet\r\nI must see what it means. She speaks of an important affair and a great\r\nservice; perhaps it is so. And Clotilde, who is coming at four o'clock!\r\nI must get the first of the pair off by three at the latest. By Jove,\r\nprovided they don't run up against one another! What bothers women are.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he reflected that, after all, his own wife was the only one who\r\nnever bothered him at all. She lived in her own way, and seemed to be\r\nvery fond of him during the hours destined to love, for she would not\r\nadmit that the unchangeable order of the ordinary occupations of life\r\nshould be interfered with.\r\n\r\nHe walked slowly towards the rendezvous, mentally working himself up\r\nagainst Madame Walter. \"Ah! I will just receive her nicely if she has\r\nnothing to tell me. Cambronne's language will be academical compared to\r\nmine. I will tell her that I will never set foot in her house again, to\r\nbegin with.\"\r\n\r\nHe went in to wait for Madame Walter. She arrived almost immediately,\r\nand as soon as she caught sight of him, she exclaimed, \"Ah, you have had\r\nmy telegram! How fortunate.\"\r\n\r\nHe put on a grumpy expression, saying: \"By Jove, yes; I found it at the\r\noffice just as I was going to start off to the Chamber. What is it you\r\nwant now?\"\r\n\r\nShe had raised her veil to kiss him, and drew nearer with the timid and\r\nsubmissive air of an oft-beaten dog.\r\n\r\n\"How cruel you are towards me! How harshly you speak to me! What have I\r\ndone to you? You cannot imagine how I suffer through you.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHe growled: \"Don't go on again in that style.\"\r\n\r\nShe was standing close to him, only waiting for a smile, a gesture, to\r\nthrow herself into his arms, and murmured: \"You should not have taken me\r\nto treat me thus, you should have left me sober-minded and happy as I\r\nwas. Do you remember what you said to me in the church, and how you\r\nforced me into this house? And now, how do you speak to me? how do you\r\nreceive me? Oh, God! oh, God! what pain you give me!\"\r\n\r\nHe stamped his foot, and exclaimed, violently: \"Ah, bosh! That's enough\r\nof it! I can't see you a moment without hearing all that foolery. One\r\nwould really think that I had carried you off at twelve years of age,\r\nand that you were as ignorant as an angel. No, my dear, let us put\r\nthings in their proper light; there was no seduction of a young girl in\r\nthe business. You gave yourself to me at full years of discretion. I\r\nthank you. I am infinitely grateful to you, but I am not bound to be\r\ntied till death to your petticoat strings. You have a husband and I a\r\nwife. We are neither of us free. We indulged in a mutual caprice, and it\r\nis over.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you are brutal, coarse, shameless,\" she said; \"I was indeed no\r\nlonger a young girl, but I had never loved, never faltered.\"\r\n\r\nHe cut her short with: \"I know it. You have told me so twenty times. But\r\nyou had had two children.\"\r\n\r\nShe drew back, exclaiming: \"Oh, George, that is unworthy of you,\" and\r\npressing her two hands to her heart, began to choke and sob.\r\n\r\nWhen he saw the tears come he took his hat from the corner of the\r\nmantelpiece, saying: \"Oh, you are going to cry, are you? Good-bye, then.\r\nSo it was to show off in this way that you came here, eh?\"\r\n\r\nShe had taken a step forward in order to bar the way, and quickly\r\npulling out a handkerchief from her pocket, wiped her eyes with an\r\nabrupt movement. Her voice grew firmer by the effort of her will, as she\r\nsaid, in tones tremulous with pain, \"No--I came to--to tell you some\r\nnews--political news--to put you in the way of gaining fifty thousand\r\nfrancs--or even more--if you like.\"\r\n\r\nHe inquired, suddenly softening, \"How so? What do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"I caught, by chance, yesterday evening, some words between my husband\r\nand Laroche-Mathieu. They do not, besides, trouble themselves to hide\r\nmuch from me. But Walter recommended the Minister not to let you into\r\nthe secret, as you would reveal everything.\"\r\n\r\nDu Roy had put his hat down on a chair, and was waiting very\r\nattentively.\r\n\r\n\"What is up, then?\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"They are going to take possession of Morocco.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense! I lunched with Laroche-Mathieu, who almost dictated to me the\r\nintention of the Cabinet.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, darling, they are humbugging you, because they were afraid lest\r\ntheir plan should be known.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sit down,\" said George, and sat down himself in an armchair. Then she\r\ndrew towards him a low stool, and sitting down on it between his knees,\r\nwent on in a coaxing tone, \"As I am always thinking about you, I pay\r\nattention now to everything that is whispered around me.\"\r\n\r\nAnd she began quietly to explain to him how she had guessed for some\r\ntime past that something was being hatched unknown to him; that they\r\nwere making use of him, while dreading his co-operation. She said, \"You\r\nknow, when one is in love, one grows cunning.\"\r\n\r\nAt length, the day before, she had understood it all. It was a business\r\ntransaction, a thumping affair, worked out on the quiet. She smiled now,\r\nhappy in her dexterity, and grew excited, speaking like a financier's\r\nwife accustomed to see the market rigged, used to rises and falls that\r\nruin, in two hours of speculation, thousands of little folk who have\r\nplaced their savings in undertakings guaranteed by the names of men\r\nhonored and respected in the world of politics of finance.\r\n\r\nShe repeated, \"Oh, it is very smart what they have been up to! Very\r\nsmart. It was Walter who did it all, though, and he knows all about such\r\nthings. Really, it is a first-class job.\"\r\n\r\nHe grew impatient at these preliminaries, and exclaimed, \"Come, tell me\r\nwhat it is at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, this is what it is. The Tangiers expedition was decided\r\nupon between them on the day that Laroche-Mathieu took the ministry of\r\nforeign affairs, and little by little they have bought up the whole of\r\nthe Morocco loan, which had fallen to sixty-four or sixty-five francs.\r\nThey have bought it up very cleverly by means of shady brokers, who did\r\nnot awaken any mistrust. They have even sold the Rothschilds, who grew\r\nastonished to find Morocco stock always asked for, and who were\r\nastonished by having agents pointed out to them--all lame ducks. That\r\nquieted the big financiers. And now the expedition is to take place, and\r\nas soon as we are there the French Government will guarantee the debt.\r\nOur friends will gain fifty or sixty millions. You understand the\r\nmatter? You understand, too, how afraid they have been of everyone, of\r\nthe slightest indiscretion?\"\r\n\r\nShe had leaned her head against the young fellow's waistcoat, and with\r\nher arms resting on his legs, pressed up against him, feeling that she\r\nwas interesting him now, and ready to do anything for a caress, for a\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n\"You are quite certain?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"I should think so,\" she replied, with confidence.\r\n\r\n\"It is very smart indeed. As to that swine of a Laroche-Mathieu, just\r\nsee if I don't pay him out one of these days. Oh, the scoundrel, just\r\nlet him look out for himself! He shall go through my hands.\" Then he\r\nbegan to reflect, and went on, \"We ought, though, to profit by all\r\nthis.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can still buy some of the loan,\" said she; \"it is only at\r\nseventy-two francs.\"\r\n\r\nHe said, \"Yes, but I have no money under my hand.\"\r\n\r\nShe raised her eyes towards him, eyes full of entreaty, saying, \"I have\r\nthought of that, darling, and if you were very nice, very nice, if you\r\nloved me a little, you would let me lend you some.\"\r\n\r\nHe answered, abruptly and almost harshly, \"As to that, no, indeed.\"\r\n\r\nShe murmured, in an imploring voice: \"Listen, there is something that\r\nyou can do without borrowing money. I wanted to buy ten thousand francs'\r\nworth of the loan to make a little nest-egg. Well, I will take twenty\r\nthousand, and you shall stand in for half. You understand that I am not\r\ngoing to hand the money over to Walter. So there is nothing to pay for\r\nthe present. If it all succeeds, you gain seventy thousand francs. If\r\nnot, you will owe me ten thousand, which you can pay when you please.\"\r\n\r\nHe remarked, \"No, I do not like such pains.\"\r\n\r\nThen she argued, in order to get him to make up his mind. She proved to\r\nhim that he was really pledging his word for ten thousand francs, that\r\nhe was running risks, and that she was not advancing him anything, since\r\nthe actual outlay was made by Walter's bank. She pointed out to him,\r\nbesides, that it was he who had carried on in the _Vie Francaise_ the\r\nwhole of the political campaign that had rendered the scheme possible.\r\nHe would be very foolish not to profit by it. He still hesitated, and\r\nshe added, \"But just reflect that in reality it is Walter who is\r\nadvancing you these ten thousand Francs, and that you have rendered him\r\nservices worth a great deal more than that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, then,\" said he, \"I will go halves with you. If we lose, I\r\nwill repay you the ten thousand francs.\"\r\n\r\nShe was so pleased that she rose, took his head in both her hands, and\r\nbegan to kiss him eagerly. He did not resist at first, but as she grew\r\nbolder, clasping him to her and devouring him with caresses, he\r\nreflected that the other would be there shortly, and that if he yielded\r\nhe would lose time and exhaust in the arms of the old woman an ardor\r\nthat he had better reserve for the young one. So he repulsed her gently,\r\nsaying, \"Come, be good now.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked at him disconsolately, saying, \"Oh, George, can't I even kiss\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\nHe replied, \"No, not to-day. I have a headache, and it upsets me.\"\r\n\r\nShe sat down again docilely between his knees, and asked, \"Will you come\r\nand dine with us to-morrow? You would give me much pleasure.\"\r\n\r\nHe hesitated, but dared not refuse, so said, \"Certainly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks, darling.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nShe rubbed her cheek slowly against his breast with a regular and\r\ncoaxing movement, and one of her long black hairs caught in his\r\nwaistcoat. She noticed it, and a wild idea crossed her mind, one of\r\nthose superstitious notions which are often the whole of a woman's\r\nreason. She began to twist this hair gently round a button. Then she\r\nfastened another hair to the next button, and a third to the next. One\r\nto every button. He would tear them out of her head presently when he\r\nrose, and hurt her. What happiness! And he would carry away something of\r\nher without knowing it; he would carry away a tiny lock of her hair\r\nwhich he had never yet asked for. It was a tie by which she attached him\r\nto her, a secret, invisible bond, a talisman she left with him. Without\r\nwilling it he would think of her, dream of her, and perhaps love her a\r\nlittle more the next day.\r\n\r\nHe said, all at once, \"I must leave you, because I am expected at the\r\nChamber at the close of the sitting. I cannot miss attending to-day.\"\r\n\r\nShe sighed, \"Already!\" and then added, resignedly, \"Go, dear, but you\r\nwill come to dinner to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nAnd suddenly she drew aside. There was a short and sharp pain in her\r\nhead, as though needles had been stuck into the skin. Her heart\r\nthrobbed; she was pleased to have suffered a little by him. \"Good-bye,\"\r\nsaid she.\r\n\r\nHe took her in his arms with a compassionate smile, and coldly kissed\r\nher eyes. But she, maddened by this contact, again murmured, \"Already!\"\r\nwhile her suppliant glance indicated the bedroom, the door of which was\r\nopen.\r\n\r\nHe stepped away from her, and said in a hurried tone, \"I must be off; I\r\nshall be late.\"\r\n\r\nThen she held out her lips, which he barely brushed with his, and having\r\nhanded her her parasol, which she was forgetting, he continued, \"Come,\r\ncome, we must be quick, it is past three o'clock.\"\r\n\r\nShe went out before him, saying, \"To-morrow, at seven,\" and he repeated,\r\n\"To-morrow, at seven.\"\r\n\r\nThey separated, she turning to the right and he to the left. Du Roy\r\nwalked as far as the outer boulevard. Then he slowly strolled back along\r\nthe Boulevard Malesherbes. Passing a pastry cook's, he noticed some\r\n_marrons glaces_ in a glass jar, and thought, \"I will take in a pound\r\nfor Clotilde.\"\r\n\r\nHe bought a bag of these sweetmeats, which she was passionately fond of,\r\nand at four o'clock returned to wait for his young mistress. She was a\r\nlittle late, because her husband had come home for a week, and said,\r\n\"Can you come and dine with us to-morrow? He will be so pleased to see\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I dine with the governor. We have a heap of political and financial\r\nmatters to talk over.\"\r\n\r\nShe had taken off her bonnet, and was now laying aside her bodice, which\r\nwas too tight for her. He pointed out the bag on the mantel-shelf,\r\nsaying, \"I have bought you some _marrons glaces_.\"\r\n\r\nShe clapped her hands, exclaiming: \"How nice; what a dear you are.\"\r\n\r\nShe took one, tasted them, and said: \"They are delicious. I feel sure I\r\nshall not leave one of them.\" Then she added, looking at George with\r\nsensual merriment: \"You flatter all my vices, then.\"\r\n\r\nShe slowly ate the sweetmeats, looking continually into the bag to see\r\nif there were any left. \"There, sit down in the armchair,\" said she,\r\n\"and I will squat down between your knees and nibble my bon-bons. I\r\nshall be very comfortable.\"\r\n\r\nHe smiled, sat down, and took her between his knees, as he had had\r\nMadame Walter shortly before. She raised her head in order to speak to\r\nhim, and said, with her mouth full: \"Do you know, darling, I dreamt of\r\nyou? I dreamt that we were both taking a long journey together on a\r\ncamel. He had two humps, and we were each sitting astride on a hump,\r\ncrossing the desert. We had taken some sandwiches in a piece of paper\r\nand some wine in a bottle, and were dining on our humps. But it annoyed\r\nme because we could not do anything else; we were too far off from one\r\nanother, and I wanted to get down.\"\r\n\r\nHe answered: \"I want to get down, too.\"\r\n\r\nHe laughed, amused at the story, and encouraged her to talk nonsense, to\r\nchatter, to indulge in all the child's play of conversation which lovers\r\nutter. The nonsense which he thought delightful in the mouth of Madame\r\nde Marelle would have exasperated him in that of Madame Walter.\r\nClotilde, too, called him \"My darling,\" \"My pet,\" \"My own.\" These words\r\nseemed sweet and caressing. Said by the other woman shortly before, they\r\nhad irritated and sickened him. For words of love, which are always the\r\nsame, take the flavor of the lips they come from.\r\n\r\nBut he was thinking, even while amusing himself with this nonsense, of\r\nthe seventy thousand francs he was going to gain, and suddenly checked\r\nthe gabble of his companion by two little taps with his finger on her\r\nhead. \"Listen, pet,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"I am going to entrust you with a commission for your husband. Tell him\r\nfrom me to buy to-morrow ten thousand francs' worth of the Morocco loan,\r\nwhich is quoted at seventy-two, and I promise him that he will gain from\r\nsixty to eighty thousand francs before three months are over. Recommend\r\nthe most positive silence to him. Tell him from me that the expedition\r\nto Tangiers is decided on, and that the French government will guarantee\r\nthe debt of Morocco. But do not let anything out about it. It is a State\r\nsecret that I am entrusting to you.\"\r\n\r\nShe listened to him seriously, and murmured: \"Thank you, I will tell my\r\nhusband this evening. You can reckon on him; he will not talk. He is a\r\nvery safe man, and there is no danger.\"\r\n\r\nBut she had eaten all the sweetmeats. She crushed up the bag between her\r\nhands and flung it into the fireplace. Then she said, \"Let us go to\r\nbed,\" and without getting up, began to unbutton George's waistcoat. All\r\nat once she stopped, and pulling out between two fingers a long hair,\r\ncaught in a buttonhole, began to laugh. \"There, you have brought away\r\none of Madeleine's hairs. There is a faithful husband for you.\"\r\n\r\nThen, becoming once more serious, she carefully examined on her head the\r\nalmost imperceptible thread she had found, and murmured: \"It is not\r\nMadeleine's, it is too dark.\"\r\n\r\nHe smiled, saying: \"It is very likely one of the maid's.\"\r\n\r\nBut she was inspecting the waistcoat with the attention of a detective,\r\nand collected a second hair rolled round a button; then she perceived a\r\nthird, and pale and somewhat trembling, exclaimed: \"Oh, you have been\r\nsleeping with a woman who has wrapped her hair round all your buttons.\"\r\n\r\nHe was astonished, and gasped out: \"No, you are mad.\"\r\n\r\nAll at once he remembered, understood it all, was uneasy at first, and\r\nthen denied the charge with a chuckle, not vexed at the bottom that she\r\nshould suspect him of other loves. She kept on searching, and still\r\nfound hairs, which she rapidly untwisted and threw on the carpet. She\r\nhad guessed matters with her artful woman's instinct, and stammered out,\r\nvexed, angry, and ready to cry: \"She loves you, she does--and she wanted\r\nyou to take away something belonging to her. Oh, what a traitor you\r\nare!\" But all at once she gave a cry, a shrill cry of nervous joy. \"Oh!\r\noh! it is an old woman--here is a white hair. Ah, you go in for old\r\nwomen now! Do they pay you, eh--do they pay you? Ah, so you have come to\r\nold women, have you? Then you have no longer any need of me. Keep the\r\nother one.\"\r\n\r\nShe rose, ran to her bodice thrown onto a chair, and began hurriedly to\r\nput it on again. He sought to retain her, stammering confusedly: \"But,\r\nno, Clo, you are silly. I do not know anything about it. Listen\r\nnow--stay here. Come, now--stay here.\"\r\n\r\nShe repeated: \"Keep your old woman--keep her. Have a ring made out of\r\nher hair--out of her white hair. You have enough of it for that.\"\r\n\r\nWith abrupt and swift movements she had dressed herself and put on her\r\nbonnet and veil, and when he sought to take hold of her, gave him a\r\nsmack with all her strength. While he remained bewildered, she opened\r\nthe door and fled.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he was alone he was seized with furious anger against that\r\nold hag of a Mother Walter. Ah, he would send her about her business,\r\nand pretty roughly, too! He bathed his reddened cheek and then went out,\r\nin turn meditating vengeance. This time he would not forgive her. Ah,\r\nno! He walked down as far as the boulevard, and sauntering along stopped\r\nin front of a jeweler's shop to look at a chronometer he had fancied for\r\na long time back, and which was ticketed eighteen hundred francs. He\r\nthought all at once, with a thrill of joy at his heart, \"If I gain my\r\nseventy thousand francs I can afford it.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he began to think of all the things he would do with these seventy\r\nthousand francs. In the first place, he would get elected deputy. Then\r\nhe would buy his chronometer, and would speculate on the Bourse, and\r\nwould--\r\n\r\nHe did not want to go to the office, preferring to consult Madeleine\r\nbefore seeing Walter and writing his article, and started for home. He\r\nhad reached the Rue Druot, when he stopped short. He had forgotten to\r\nask after the Count de Vaudrec, who lived in the Chaussee d'Antin. He\r\ntherefore turned back, still sauntering, thinking of a thousand things,\r\nmainly pleasant, of his coming fortune, and also of that scoundrel of a\r\nLaroche-Mathieu, and that old stickfast of a Madame Walter. He was not\r\nuneasy about the wrath of Clotilde, knowing very well that she forgave\r\nquickly.\r\n\r\nHe asked the doorkeeper of the house in which the Count de Vaudrec\r\nresided: \"How is Monsieur de Vaudrec? I hear that he has been unwell\r\nthese last few days.\"\r\n\r\nThe man replied: \"The Count is very bad indeed, sir. They are afraid he\r\nwill not live through the night; the gout has mounted to his heart.\"\r\n\r\nDu Roy was so startled that he no longer knew what he ought to do.\r\nVaudrec dying! Confused and disquieting ideas shot through his mind that\r\nhe dared not even admit to himself. He stammered: \"Thank you; I will\r\ncall again,\" without knowing what he was saying.\r\n\r\nThen he jumped into a cab and was driven home. His wife had come in. He\r\nwent into her room breathless, and said at once: \"Have you heard?\r\nVaudrec is dying.\"\r\n\r\nShe was sitting down reading a letter. She raised her eyes, and\r\nrepeating thrice: \"Oh! what do you say, what do you say, what do you\r\nsay?\"\r\n\r\n\"I say that Vaudrec is dying from a fit of gout that has flown to the\r\nheart.\" Then he added: \"What do you think of doing?\"\r\n\r\nShe had risen livid, and with her cheeks shaken by a nervous quivering,\r\nthen she began to cry terribly, hiding her face in her hands. She stood\r\nshaken by sobs and torn by grief. But suddenly she mastered her sorrow,\r\nand wiping her eyes, said: \"I--I am going there--don't bother about\r\nme--I don't know when I shall be back--don't wait for me.\"\r\n\r\nHe replied: \"Very well, dear.\" They shook hands, and she went off so\r\nhurriedly that she forgot her gloves.\r\n\r\nGeorge, having dined alone, began to write his article. He did so\r\nexactly in accordance with the minister's instructions, giving his\r\nreaders to understand that the expedition to Morocco would not take\r\nplace. Then he took it to the office, chatted for a few minutes with the\r\ngovernor, and went out smoking, light-hearted, though he knew not why.\r\nHis wife had not come home, and he went to bed and fell asleep.\r\n\r\nMadeleine came in towards midnight. George, suddenly roused, sat up in\r\nbed. \"Well?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nHe had never seen her so pale and so deeply moved. She murmured: \"He is\r\ndead.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!--and he did not say anything?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing. He had lost consciousness when I arrived.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge was thinking. Questions rose to his lips that he did not dare to\r\nput. \"Come to bed,\" said he.\r\n\r\nShe undressed rapidly, and slipped into bed beside him, when he resumed:\r\n\"Were there any relations present at his death-bed?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only a nephew.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! Did he see this nephew often?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never. They had not met for ten years.\"\r\n\r\n\"Had he any other relatives?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I do not think so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then it is his nephew who will inherit?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not know.\"\r\n\r\n\"He was very well off, Vaudrec?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, very well off.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know what his fortune was?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, not exactly. One or two millions, perhaps.\"\r\n\r\nHe said no more. She blew out the light, and they remained stretched\r\nout, side by side, in the darkness--silent, wakeful, and reflecting. He\r\nno longer felt inclined for sleep. He now thought the seventy thousand\r\nfrancs promised by Madame Walter insignificant. Suddenly he fancied that\r\nMadeleine was crying. He inquired, in order to make certain: \"Are you\r\nasleep?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\nHer voice was tearful and quavering, and he said: \"I forgot to tell you\r\nwhen I came in that your minister has let us in nicely.\"\r\n\r\n\"How so?\"\r\n\r\nHe told her at length, with all details, the plan hatched between\r\nLaroche-Mathieu and Walter. When he had finished, she asked: \"How do you\r\nknow this?\"\r\n\r\nHe replied: \"You will excuse me not telling you. You have your means of\r\ninformation, which I do not seek to penetrate. I have mine, which I wish\r\nto keep to myself. I can, in any case, answer for the correctness of my\r\ninformation.\"\r\n\r\nThen she murmured: \"Yes, it is quite possible. I fancied they were up to\r\nsomething without us.\"\r\n\r\nBut George, who no longer felt sleepy, had drawn closer to his wife, and\r\ngently kissed her ear. She repulsed him sharply. \"I beg of you to leave\r\nme alone. I am not in a mood to romp.\" He turned resignedly towards the\r\nwall, and having closed his eyes, ended by falling asleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe church was draped with black, and over the main entrance a huge\r\nscutcheon, surmounted by a coronet, announced to the passers-by that a\r\ngentleman was being buried. The ceremony was just over, and those\r\npresent at it were slowly dispersing, defiling past the coffin and the\r\nnephew of the Count de Vaudrec, who was shaking extended hands and\r\nreturning bows. When George Du Roy and his wife came out of the church\r\nthey began to walk homeward side by side, silent and preoccupied. At\r\nlength George said, as though speaking to himself: \"Really, it is very\r\nstrange.\"\r\n\r\n\"What, dear?\" asked Madeleine.\r\n\r\n\"That Vaudrec should not have left us anything.\"\r\n\r\nShe blushed suddenly, as though a rosy veil had been cast over her white\r\nskin, and said: \"Why should he have left us anything? There was no\r\nreason for it.\" Then, after a few moments' silence, she went on: \"There\r\nis perhaps a will in the hands of some notary. We know nothing as yet.\"\r\n\r\nHe reflected for a short time, and then murmured: \"Yes, it is probable,\r\nfor, after all, he was the most intimate friend of us both. He dined\r\nwith us twice a week, called at all hours, and was at home at our place,\r\nquite at home in every respect. He loved you like a father, and had no\r\nchildren, no brothers and sisters, nothing but a nephew, and a nephew he\r\nnever used to see. Yes, there must be a will. I do not care for much,\r\nonly a remembrance to show that he thought of us, that he loved us, that\r\nhe recognized the affection we felt for him. He certainly owed us some\r\nsuch mark of friendship.\"\r\n\r\nShe said in a pensive and indifferent manner: \"It is possible, indeed,\r\nthat there may be a will.\"\r\n\r\nAs they entered their rooms, the man-servant handed a letter to\r\nMadeleine. She opened it, and then held it out to her husband. It ran as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    \"Office of Maitre Lamaneur, Notary,\r\n    \"17 Rue des Vosges.\r\n\r\n     \"MADAME: I have the honor to beg you to favor me with a call\r\n     here on Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday between the hours of\r\n     two and four, on business concerning you.--I am,\r\n     etc.--LAMANEUR.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge had reddened in turn. \"That is what it must be,\" said he. \"It is\r\nstrange, though, that it is you who are summoned, and not myself, who am\r\nlegally the head of the family.\"\r\n\r\nShe did not answer at once, but after a brief period of reflection,\r\nsaid: \"Shall we go round there by and by?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, certainly.\"\r\n\r\nThey set out as soon as they had lunched. When they entered Maitre\r\nLamaneur's office, the head clerk rose with marked attention and ushered\r\nthem in to his master. The notary was a round, little man, round all\r\nover. His head looked like a ball nailed onto another ball, which had\r\nlegs so short that they almost resembled balls too. He bowed, pointed to\r\ntwo chairs, and turning towards Madeleine, said: \"Madame, I have sent\r\nfor you in order to acquaint you with the will of the Count de Vaudrec,\r\nin which you are interested.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge could not help muttering: \"I thought so.\"\r\n\r\nThe notary went on: \"I will read to you the document, which is very\r\nbrief.\"\r\n\r\nHe took a paper from a box in front of him, and read as follows:\r\n\r\n\"I, the undersigned, Paul Emile Cyprien Gontran, Count de Vaudrec, being\r\nsound in body and mind, hereby express my last wishes. As death may\r\novertake us at any moment, I wish, in provision of his attacks, to take\r\nthe precaution of making my will, which will be placed in the hands of\r\nMaitre Lamaneur. Having no direct heirs, I leave the whole of my\r\nfortune, consisting of stock to the amount of six hundred thousand\r\nfrancs, and landed property worth about five hundred thousand francs, to\r\nMadame Claire Madeleine Du Roy without any charge or condition. I beg\r\nher to accept this gift of a departed friend as a proof of a deep,\r\ndevoted, and respectful affection.\"\r\n\r\nThe notary added: \"That is all. This document is dated last August, and\r\nreplaces one of the same nature, written two years back, with the name\r\nof Madame Claire Madeleine Forestier. I have this first will, too, which\r\nwould prove, in the case of opposition on the part of the family, that\r\nthe wishes of Count de Vaudrec did not vary.\"\r\n\r\nMadeleine, very pale, looked at her feet. George nervously twisted the\r\nend of his moustache between his fingers. The notary continued after a\r\nmoment of silence: \"It is, of course, understood, sir, that your wife\r\ncannot accept the legacy without your consent.\"\r\n\r\nDu Roy rose and said, dryly: \"I must ask time to reflect.\"\r\n\r\nThe notary, who was smiling, bowed, and said in an amiable tone: \"I\r\nunderstand the scruples that cause you to hesitate, sir. I should say\r\nthat the nephew of Monsieur de Vaudrec, who became acquainted this very\r\nmorning with his uncle's last wishes, stated that he was prepared to\r\nrespect them, provided the sum of a hundred thousand francs was allowed\r\nhim. In my opinion the will is unattackable, but a law-suit would cause\r\na stir, which it may perhaps suit you to avoid. The world often judges\r\nthings ill-naturedly. In any case, can you give me your answer on all\r\nthese points before Saturday?\"\r\n\r\nGeorge bowed, saying: \"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\nThen he bowed again ceremoniously, ushered out his wife, who had\r\nremained silent, and went out himself with so stiff an air that the\r\nnotary no longer smiled.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they got home, Du Roy abruptly closed the door, and throwing\r\nhis hat onto the bed, said: \"You were Vaudrec's mistress.\"\r\n\r\nMadeleine, who was taking off her veil, turned round with a start,\r\nexclaiming: \"I? Oh!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you. A man does not leave the whole of his fortune to a woman,\r\nunless--\"\r\n\r\nShe was trembling, and was unable to remove the pins fastening the\r\ntransparent tissue. After a moment's reflection she stammered, in an\r\nagitated tone: \"Come, come--you are mad--you are--you are. Did not you,\r\nyourself, just now have hopes that he would leave us something?\"\r\n\r\nGeorge remained standing beside her, following all her emotions like a\r\nmagistrate seeking to note the least faltering on the part of an\r\naccused. He said, laying stress on every word: \"Yes, he might have left\r\nsomething to me, your husband--to me, his friend--you understand, but\r\nnot to you--my wife. The distinction is capital, essential from the\r\npoint of propriety and of public opinion.\"\r\n\r\nMadeleine in turn looked at him fixedly in the eyes, in profound and\r\nsingular fashion, as though seeking to read something there, as though\r\ntrying to discover that unknown part of a human being which we never\r\nfathom, and of which we can scarcely even catch rapid glimpses in those\r\nmoments of carelessness or inattention, which are like doors left open,\r\ngiving onto the mysterious depths of the mind. She said slowly: \"It\r\nseems to me, however, that a legacy of this importance would have been\r\nlooked on as at least equally strange left to you.\"\r\n\r\nHe asked abruptly: \"Why so?\"\r\n\r\nShe said: \"Because--\" hesitated, and then continued: \"Because you are my\r\nhusband, and have only known him for a short time, after all--because I\r\nhave been his friend for a very long while--and because his first will,\r\nmade during Forestier's lifetime, was already in my favor.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge began to stride up and down. He said: \"You cannot accept.\"\r\n\r\nShe replied in a tone of indifference: \"Precisely so; then it is not\r\nworth while waiting till Saturday, we can let Maitre Lamaneur know at\r\nonce.\"\r\n\r\nHe stopped short in front of her, and they again stood for some moments\r\nwith their eyes riveted on one another, striving to fathom the\r\nimpenetrable secret of their hearts, to cut down to the quick of their\r\nthoughts. They tried to see one another's conscience unveiled in an\r\nardent and mute interrogation; the struggle of two beings who, living\r\nside by side, were always ignorant of one another, suspecting, sniffing\r\nround, watching, but never understanding one another to the muddy\r\ndepths of their souls. And suddenly he murmured to her face, in a low\r\nvoice: \"Come, admit that you were De Vaudrec's mistress.\"\r\n\r\nShe shrugged her shoulders, saying: \"You are ridiculous. Vaudrec was\r\nvery fond of me, very--but there was nothing more--never.\"\r\n\r\nHe stamped his foot. \"You lie. It is not possible.\"\r\n\r\nShe replied, quietly: \"It is so, though.\"\r\n\r\nHe began to walk up and down again, and then, halting once more, said:\r\n\"Explain, then, how he came to leave the whole of his fortune to you.\"\r\n\r\nShe did so in a careless and disinterested tone, saying: \"It is quite\r\nsimple. As you said just now, he had only ourselves for friends, or\r\nrather myself, for he has known me from a child. My mother was a\r\ncompanion at the house of some relatives of his. He was always coming\r\nhere, and as he had no natural heirs he thought of me. That there was a\r\nlittle love for me in the matter is possible. But where is the woman who\r\nhas not been loved thus? Why should not such secret, hidden affection\r\nhave placed my name at the tip of his pen when he thought of expressing\r\nhis last wishes? He brought me flowers every Monday. You were not at all\r\nastonished at that, and yet he did not bring you any, did he? Now he has\r\ngiven me his fortune for the same reason, and because he had no one to\r\noffer it to. It would have been, on the contrary, very surprising for\r\nhim to have left it to you. Why should he have done so? What were you to\r\nhim?\"\r\n\r\nShe spoke so naturally and quietly that George hesitated. He said,\r\nhowever: \"All the same, we cannot accept this inheritance under such\r\nconditions. The effect would be deplorable. All the world would believe\r\nit; all the world would gossip about it, and laugh at me. My fellow\r\njournalists are already only too disposed to feel jealous of me and to\r\nattack me. I should have, before anyone, a care for my honor and my\r\nreputation. It is impossible for me to allow my wife to accept a legacy\r\nof this kind from a man whom public report has already assigned to her\r\nas a lover. Forestier might perhaps have tolerated it, but not me.\"\r\n\r\nShe murmured, mildly: \"Well, dear, do not let us accept it. It will be a\r\nmillion the less in our pockets, that is all.\"\r\n\r\nHe was still walking up and down, and began to think aloud, speaking for\r\nhis wife's benefit without addressing himself directly to her: \"Yes, a\r\nmillion, so much the worse. He did not understand, in making his will,\r\nwhat a fault in tact, what a breach of propriety he was committing. He\r\ndid not see in what a false, a ridiculous position he would place me.\r\nEverything is a matter of detail in this life. He should have left me\r\nhalf; that would have settled everything.\"\r\n\r\nHe sat down, crossed his legs, and began to twist the end of his\r\nmoustache, as he did in moments of boredom, uneasiness, and difficult\r\nreflection. Madeleine took up some embroidery at which she worked from\r\ntime to time, and said, while selecting her wools: \"I have only to hold\r\nmy tongue. It is for you to reflect.\"\r\n\r\nHe was a long time without replying, and then said, hesitatingly: \"The\r\nworld will never understand that Vaudrec made you his sole heiress, and\r\nthat I allowed it. To receive his fortune in that way would be an\r\nacknowledgment on your part of a guilty connection, and on mine of a\r\nshameful complaisance. Do you understand now how our acceptance of it\r\nwould be interpreted? It would be necessary to find a side issue, some\r\nclever way of palliating matters. To let it go abroad, for instance,\r\nthat he had divided the money between us, leaving half to the husband\r\nand half to the wife.\"\r\n\r\nShe observed: \"I do not see how that can be done, since the will is\r\nplain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it is very simple. You could leave me half the inheritance by a\r\ndeed of gift. We have no children, so it is feasible. In that way the\r\nmouth of public malevolence would be closed.\"\r\n\r\nShe replied, somewhat impatiently: \"I do not see any the more how the\r\nmouth of public malevolence is to be closed, since the will is there,\r\nsigned by Vaudrec?\"\r\n\r\nHe said, angrily: \"Have we any need to show it and to paste it up on all\r\nthe walls? You are really stupid. We will say that the Count de Vaudrec\r\nleft his fortune between us. That is all. But you cannot accept this\r\nlegacy without my authorization. I will only give it on condition of a\r\ndivision, which will hinder me from becoming a laughing stock.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked at him again with a penetrating glance, and said: \"As you\r\nlike. I am agreeable.\"\r\n\r\nThen he rose, and began to walk up and down again. He seemed to be\r\nhesitating anew, and now avoided his wife's penetrating glance. He was\r\nsaying: \"No, certainly not. Perhaps it would be better to give it up\r\naltogether. That is more worthy, more correct, more honorable. And yet\r\nby this plan nothing could be imagined against us--absolutely nothing.\r\nThe most unscrupulous people could only admit things as they were.\" He\r\npaused in front of Madeleine. \"Well, then, if you like, darling, I will\r\ngo back alone to Maitre Lamaneur to explain matters to him and consult\r\nhim. I will tell him of my scruples, and add that we have arrived at the\r\nnotion of a division to prevent gossip. From the moment that I accept\r\nhalf this inheritance, it is plain that no one has the right to smile.\r\nIt is equal to saying aloud: 'My wife accepts because I accept--I, her\r\nhusband, the best judge of what she may do without compromising herself.\r\nOtherwise a scandal would have arisen.'\"\r\n\r\nMadeleine merely murmured: \"Just as you like.\"\r\n\r\nHe went on with a flow of words: \"Yes, it is all as clear as daylight\r\nwith this arrangement of a division in two. We inherit from a friend who\r\ndid not want to make any difference between us, any distinction; who did\r\nnot wish to appear to say: 'I prefer one or the other after death, as I\r\ndid during life.' He liked the wife best, be it understood, but in\r\nleaving the fortune equally to both, he wished plainly to express that\r\nhis preference was purely platonic. And you may be sure that, if he had\r\nthought of it, that is what he would have done. He did not reflect. He\r\ndid not foresee the consequences. As you said very appropriately just\r\nnow, it was you to whom he offered flowers every week, it is to you he\r\nwished to leave his last remembrance, without taking into consideration\r\nthat--\"\r\n\r\nShe checked him, with a shade of irritation: \"All right; I understand.\r\nYou have no need to make so many explanations. Go to the notary's at\r\nonce.\"\r\n\r\nHe stammered, reddening: \"You are right. I am off.\"\r\n\r\nHe took his hat, and then, at the moment of going out, said: \"I will\r\ntry to settle the difficulty with the nephew for fifty thousand francs,\r\neh?\"\r\n\r\nShe replied, with dignity: \"No. Give him the hundred thousand francs he\r\nasks. Take them from my share, if you like.\"\r\n\r\nHe muttered, shamefacedly: \"Oh, no; we will share that. Giving up fifty\r\nthousand francs apiece, there still remains to us a clear million.\" He\r\nadded: \"Good-bye, then, for the present, Made.\" And he went off to\r\nexplain to the notary the plan which he asserted had been imagined by\r\nhis wife.\r\n\r\nThey signed the next day a deed of gift of five hundred thousand francs,\r\nwhich Madeleine Du Roy abandoned to her husband. On leaving the notary's\r\noffice, as the day was fine, George suggested that they should walk as\r\nfar as the boulevards. He showed himself pleasant and full of attention\r\nand affection. He laughed, pleased at everything, while she remained\r\nthoughtful and somewhat severe.\r\n\r\nIt was a somewhat cool autumn day. The people in the streets seemed in a\r\nhurry, and walked rapidly. Du Roy led his wife to the front of the shop\r\nin which he had so often gazed at the longed-for chronometer. \"Shall I\r\nstand you some jewelry?\" said he.\r\n\r\nShe replied, indifferently: \"Just as you like.\"\r\n\r\nThey went in, and he asked: \"What would you prefer--a necklace, a\r\nbracelet, or a pair of earrings?\"\r\n\r\nThe sight of the trinkets in gold, and precious stones overcame her\r\nstudied coolness, and she scanned with kindling and inquisitive eyes the\r\nglass cases filled with jewelry. And, suddenly moved by desire, said:\r\n\"That is a very pretty bracelet.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a chain of quaint pattern, every link of which had a different\r\nstone set in it.\r\n\r\nGeorge inquired: \"How much is this bracelet?\"\r\n\r\n\"Three thousand francs, sir,\" replied the jeweler.\r\n\r\n\"If you will let me have it for two thousand five hundred, it is a\r\nbargain.\"\r\n\r\nThe man hesitated, and then replied: \"No, sir; that is impossible.\"\r\n\r\nDu Roy went on: \"Come, you can throw in that chronometer for fifteen\r\nhundred; that will make four thousand, which I will pay at once. Is it\r\nagreed? If not, I will go somewhere else.\"\r\n\r\nThe jeweler, in a state of perplexity, ended by agreeing, saying: \"Very\r\ngood, sir.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the journalist, after giving his address, added: \"You will have the\r\nmonogram, G. R. C., engraved on the chronometer under a baron's\r\ncoronet.\"\r\n\r\nMadeleine, surprised, began to smile, and when they went out, took his\r\narm with a certain affection. She found him really clever and capable.\r\nNow that he had an income, he needed a title. It was quite right.\r\n\r\nThe jeweler bowed them out, saying: \"You can depend upon me; it will be\r\nready on Thursday, Baron.\"\r\n\r\nThey paused before the Vaudeville, at which a new piece was being\r\nplayed.\r\n\r\n\"If you like,\" said he, \"we will go to the theater this evening. Let us\r\nsee if we can have a box.\"\r\n\r\nThey took a box, and he continued: \"Suppose we dine at a restaurant.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes; I should like that!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHe was as happy as a king, and sought what else they could do. \"Suppose\r\nwe go and ask Madame de Marelle to spend the evening with us. Her\r\nhusband is at home, I hear, and I shall be delighted to see him.\"\r\n\r\nThey went there. George, who slightly dreaded the first meeting with his\r\nmistress, was not ill-pleased that his wife was present to prevent\r\nanything like an explanation. But Clotilde did not seem to remember\r\nanything against him, and even obliged her husband to accept the\r\ninvitation.\r\n\r\nThe dinner was lovely, and the evening pleasant. George and Madeleine\r\ngot home late. The gas was out, and to light them upstairs, the\r\njournalist struck a wax match from time to time. On reaching the\r\nfirst-floor landing the flame, suddenly starting forth as he struck,\r\ncaused their two lit-up faces to show in the glass standing out against\r\nthe darkness of the staircase. They resembled phantoms, appearing and\r\nready to vanish into the night.\r\n\r\nDu Roy raised his hand to light up their reflections, and said, with a\r\n\r\nlaugh of triumph: \"Behold the millionaires!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe conquest of Morocco had been accomplished two months back. France,\r\nmistress of Tangiers, held the whole of the African shore of the\r\nMediterranean as far as Tripoli, and had guaranteed the debt of the\r\nnewly annexed territory. It was said that two ministers had gained a\r\nscore of millions over the business, and Laroche-Mathieu was almost\r\nopenly named. As to Walter, no one in Paris was ignorant of the fact\r\nthat he had brought down two birds with one stone, and made thirty or\r\nforty millions out of the loan and eight to ten millions out of the\r\ncopper and iron mines, as well as out of a large stretch of territory\r\nbought for almost nothing prior to the conquest, and sold after the\r\nFrench occupation to companies formed to promote colonization. He had\r\nbecome in a few days one of the lords of creation, one of those\r\nomnipotent financiers more powerful than monarchs who cause heads to\r\nbow, mouths to stammer, and all that is base, cowardly, and envious, to\r\nwell up from the depths of the human heart. He was no longer the Jew\r\nWalter, head of a shady bank, manager of a fishy paper, deputy suspected\r\nof illicit jobbery. He was Monsieur Walter, the wealthy Israelite.\r\n\r\nHe wished to show himself off. Aware of the monetary embarrassments of\r\nthe Prince de Carlsbourg, who owned one of the finest mansions in the\r\nRue de Faubourg, Saint Honore, with a garden giving onto the Champs\r\nElysees, he proposed to him to buy house and furniture, without shifting\r\na stick, within twenty-four hours. He offered three millions, and the\r\nprince, tempted by the amount, accepted. The following day Walter\r\ninstalled himself in his new domicile. Then he had another idea, the\r\nidea of a conqueror who wishes to conquer Paris, the idea of a\r\nBonaparte. The whole city was flocking at that moment to see a great\r\npainting by the Hungarian artist, Karl Marcowitch, exhibited at a\r\ndealer's named Jacques Lenoble, and representing Christ walking on the\r\nwater. The art critics, filled with enthusiasm, declared the picture the\r\nmost superb masterpiece of the century. Walter bought it for four\r\nhundred thousand francs, and took it away, thus cutting suddenly short a\r\nflow of public curiosity, and forcing the whole of Paris to speak of him\r\nin terms of envy, blame, or approbation. Then he had it announced in the\r\npapers that he would invite everyone known in Parisian society to view\r\nat his house some evening this triumph of the foreign master, in order\r\nthat it might not be said that he had hidden away a work of art. His\r\nhouse would be open; let those who would, come. It would be enough to\r\nshow at the door the letter of invitation.\r\n\r\nThis ran as follows: \"Monsieur and Madame Walter beg of you to honor\r\nthem with your company on December 30th, between 9 and 12 p. m., to view\r\nthe picture by Karl Marcowitch, 'Jesus Walking on the Waters,' lit up by\r\nelectric light.\" Then, as a postscript, in small letters: \"Dancing after\r\nmidnight.\" So those who wished to stay could, and out of these the\r\n\r\nWalters would recruit their future acquaintances. The others would view\r\nthe picture, the mansion, and their owners with worldly curiosity,\r\ninsolent and indifferent, and would then go away as they came. But Daddy\r\nWalter knew very well that they would return later on, as they had come\r\nto his Israelite brethren grown rich like himself. The first thing was\r\nthat they should enter his house, all these titled paupers who were\r\nmentioned in the papers, and they would enter it to see the face of a\r\nman who had gained fifty millions in six weeks; they would enter it to\r\nsee and note who else came there; they would also enter it because he\r\nhad had the good taste and dexterity to summon them to admire a\r\nChristian picture at the home of a child of Israel. He seemed to say to\r\nthem: \"You see I have given five hundred thousand francs for the\r\nreligious masterpiece of Marcowitch, 'Jesus Walking on the Waters.' And\r\nthis masterpiece will always remain before my eyes in the house of the\r\nJew, Walter.\"\r\n\r\nIn society there had been a great deal of talk over these invitations,\r\nwhich, after all, did not pledge one in any way. One could go there as\r\none went to see watercolors at Monsieur Petit's. The Walters owned a\r\nmasterpiece, and threw open their doors one evening so that everyone\r\ncould admire it. Nothing could be better. The _Vie Francaise_ for a\r\nfortnight past had published every morning a note on this coming event\r\nof the 30th December, and had striven to kindle public curiosity.\r\n\r\nDu Roy was furious at the governor's triumph. He had thought himself\r\nrich with the five hundred thousand francs extorted from his wife, and\r\nnow he held himself to be poor, fearfully poor, when comparing his\r\nmodest fortune with the shower of millions that had fallen around him,\r\nwithout his being able to pick any of it up. His envious hatred waxed\r\ndaily. He was angry with everyone--with the Walters, whom he had not\r\nbeen to see at their new home; with his wife, who, deceived by\r\nLaroche-Mathieu, had persuaded him not to invest in the Morocco loan;\r\nand, above all, with the minister who had tricked him, who had made use\r\nof him, and who dined at his table twice a week. George was his agent,\r\nhis secretary, his mouthpiece, and when he was writing from his\r\ndictation felt wild longings to strangle this triumphant foe. As a\r\nminister, Laroche-Mathieu had shown modesty in mien, and in order to\r\nretain his portfolio, did not let it be seen that he was gorged with\r\ngold. But Du Roy felt the presence of this gold in the haughtier tone of\r\nthe parvenu barrister, in his more insolent gestures, his more daring\r\naffirmation, his perfect self-confidence. Laroche-Mathieu now reigned in\r\nthe Du Roy household, having taken the place and the days of the Count\r\nde Vaudrec, and spoke to the servants like a second master. George\r\ntolerated him with a quiver running through him like a dog who wants to\r\nbite, and dares not. But he was often harsh and brutal towards\r\nMadeleine, who shrugged her shoulders and treated him like a clumsy\r\nchild. She was, besides, astonished at his continual ill-humor, and\r\nrepeated: \"I cannot make you out. You are always grumbling, and yet your\r\nposition is a splendid one.\"\r\n\r\nHe would turn his back without replying.\r\n\r\nHe had declared at first that he would not go to the governor's\r\nentertainment, and that he would never more set foot in the house of\r\nthat dirty Jew. For two months Madame Walter had been writing to him\r\ndaily, begging him to come, to make an appointment with her whenever he\r\nliked, in order, she said, that she might hand over the seventy thousand\r\nfrancs she had gained for him. He did not reply, and threw these\r\ndespairing letters into the fire. Not that he had renounced receiving\r\nhis share of their profits, but he wanted to madden her, to treat her\r\nwith contempt, to trample her under feet. She was too rich. He wanted to\r\nshow his pride. The very day of the exhibition of the picture, as\r\nMadeleine pointed out to him that he was very wrong not to go, he\r\nreplied: \"Hold your tongue. I shall stay at home.\"\r\n\r\nThen after dinner he suddenly said: \"It will be better after all to\r\nundergo this affliction. Get dressed at once.\"\r\n\r\nShe was expecting this, and said: \"I will be ready in a quarter of an\r\nhour.\" He dressed growling, and even in the cab he continued to spit out\r\nhis spleen.\r\n\r\nThe court-yard of the Carlsbourg mansion was lit up by four electric\r\nlights, looking like four small bluish moons, one at each corner. A\r\nsplendid carpet was laid down the high flight of steps, on each of which\r\na footman in livery stood motionless as a statue.\r\n\r\nDu Roy muttered: \"Here's a fine show-off for you,\" and shrugged his\r\nshoulders, his heart contracted by jealousy.\r\n\r\nHis wife said: \"Be quiet and do likewise.\"\r\n\r\nThey went in and handed their heavy outer garments to the footmen who\r\nadvanced to meet them. Several ladies were also there with their\r\nhusbands, freeing themselves from their furs. Murmurs of: \"It is very\r\nbeautiful, very beautiful,\" could be heard. The immense entrance hall\r\nwas hung with tapestry, representing the adventures of Mars and Venus.\r\nTo the right and left were the two branches of a colossal double\r\nstaircase, which met on the first floor. The banisters were a marvel of\r\nwrought-iron work, the dull old gilding of which glittered with discreet\r\nluster beside the steps of pink marble. At the entrance to the\r\nreception-rooms two little girls, one in a pink folly costume, and the\r\nother in a blue one, offered a bouquet of flowers to each lady. This was\r\nheld to be charming.\r\n\r\nThe reception-rooms were already crowded. Most of the ladies were in\r\noutdoor dress, showing that they came there as to any other exhibition.\r\nThose who intended remaining for the ball were bare armed and bare\r\nnecked. Madame Walter, surrounded by her friends, was in the second room\r\nacknowledging the greetings of the visitors. Many of these did not know\r\nher, and walked about as though in a museum, without troubling\r\nthemselves about the masters of the house.\r\n\r\nWhen she perceived Du Roy she grew livid, and made a movement as though\r\nto advance towards him. Then she remained motionless, awaiting him. He\r\ngreeted her ceremoniously, while Madeleine overwhelmed her with\r\naffection and compliments. Then George left his wife with her and lost\r\nhimself in the crowd, to listen to the spiteful things that assuredly\r\nmust be said.\r\n\r\nFive reception-rooms opened one into the other, hung with costly stuffs,\r\nItalian embroideries, or oriental rugs of varying shades and styles, and\r\nbearing on their walls pictures by old masters. People stopped, above\r\nall, to admire a small room in the Louis XVI style, a kind of boudoir,\r\nlined with silk, with bouquets of roses on a pale blue ground. The\r\nfurniture, of gilt wood, upholstered in the same material, was admirably\r\nfinished.\r\n\r\nGeorge recognized some well-known people--the Duchess de Ferracine, the\r\nCount and Countess de Ravenal, General Prince d'Andremont, the beautiful\r\nMarchioness des Dunes, and all those folk who are seen at first\r\nperformances. He was suddenly seized by the arm, and a young and pleased\r\nvoice murmured in his ear: \"Ah! here you are at last, you naughty\r\nPretty-boy. How is it one no longer sees you?\"\r\n\r\nIt was Susan Walter, scanning him with her enamel-like eyes from beneath\r\nthe curly cloud of her fair hair. He was delighted to see her again, and\r\nfrankly pressed her hand. Then, excusing himself, he said: \"I have not\r\nbeen able to come. I have had so much to do during the past two months\r\nthat I have not been out at all.\"\r\n\r\nShe said, with her serious air: \"That is wrong, very wrong. You have\r\ncaused us a great deal of pain, for we adore you, mamma and I. As to\r\nmyself, I cannot get on without you. When you are not here I am bored\r\nto death. You see I tell you so plainly, so that you may no longer have\r\nthe right of disappearing like that. Give me your arm, I will show you\r\n'Jesus Walking on the Waters' myself; it is right away at the end,\r\nbeyond the conservatory. Papa had it put there so that they should be\r\nobliged to see everything before they could get to it. It is astonishing\r\nhow he is showing off this place.\"\r\n\r\nThey went on quietly among the crowd. People turned round to look at\r\nthis good-looking fellow and this charming little doll. A well-known\r\npainter said: \"What a pretty pair. They go capitally together.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge thought: \"If I had been really clever, this is the girl I should\r\nhave married. It was possible. How is it I did not think of it? How did\r\nI come to take that other one? What a piece of stupidity. We always act\r\ntoo impetuously, and never reflect sufficiently.\"\r\n\r\nAnd envy, bitter envy, sank drop by drop into his mind like a gall,\r\nembittering all his pleasures, and rendering existence hateful.\r\n\r\nSusan was saying: \"Oh! do come often, Pretty-boy; we will go in for all\r\nmanner of things now, papa is so rich. We will amuse ourselves like\r\nmadcaps.\"\r\n\r\nHe answered, still following up his idea: \"Oh! you will marry now. You\r\nwill marry some prince, a ruined one, and we shall scarcely see one\r\nanother.\"\r\n\r\nShe exclaimed, frankly: \"Oh! no, not yet. I want someone who pleases me,\r\nwho pleases me a great deal, who pleases me altogether. I am rich enough\r\nfor two.\"\r\n\r\nHe smiled with a haughty and ironical smile, and began to point out to\r\nher people that were passing, very noble folk who had sold their rusty\r\ntitles to the daughters of financiers like herself, and who now lived\r\nwith or away from their wives, but free, impudent, known, and respected.\r\nHe concluded with: \"I will not give you six months before you are caught\r\nwith that same bait. You will be a marchioness, a duchess or a princess,\r\nand will look down on me from a very great height, miss.\"\r\n\r\nShe grew indignant, tapped him on the arm with her fan, and vowed that\r\nshe would marry according to the dictates of her heart.\r\n\r\nHe sneered: \"We shall see about all that, you are too rich.\"\r\n\r\nShe remarked: \"But you, too, have come in for an inheritance.\"\r\n\r\nHe uttered in a tone of contempt: \"Oh! not worth speaking about.\r\nScarcely twenty thousand francs a year, not much in these days.\"\r\n\r\n\"But your wife has also inherited.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. A million between us. Forty thousand francs' income. We cannot\r\neven keep a carriage on it.\"\r\n\r\nThey had reached the last of the reception-rooms, and before them lay\r\nthe conservatory--a huge winter garden full of tall, tropical trees,\r\nsheltering clumps of rare flowers. Penetrating beneath this somber\r\ngreenery, through which the light streamed like a flood of silver, they\r\nbreathed the warm odor of damp earth, and an air heavy with perfumes. It\r\nwas a strange sensation, at once sweet, unwholesome, and pleasant, of a\r\nnature that was artificial, soft, and enervating. They walked on carpets\r\nexactly like moss, between two thick clumps of shrubs. All at once Du\r\nRoy noticed on his left, under a wide dome of palms, a broad basin of\r\nwhite marble, large enough to bathe in, and on the edge of which four\r\nlarge Delft swans poured forth water through their open beaks. The\r\nbottom of the basin was strewn with golden sand, and swimming about in\r\nit were some enormous goldfish, quaint Chinese monsters, with projecting\r\neyes and scales edged with blue, mandarins of the waters, who recalled,\r\nthus suspended above this gold-colored ground, the embroideries of the\r\nFlowery Land. The journalist halted with beating heart. He said to\r\nhimself: \"Here is luxury. These are the houses in which one ought to\r\nlive. Others have arrived at it. Why should not I?\"\r\n\r\nHe thought of means of doing so; did not find them at once, and grew\r\nirritated at his powerlessness. His companion, somewhat thoughtful, did\r\nnot speak. He looked at her in sidelong fashion, and again thought: \"To\r\nmarry this little puppet would suffice.\"\r\n\r\nBut Susan all at once seemed to wake up. \"Attention!\" said she; and\r\npushing George through a group which barred their way, she made him turn\r\nsharply to the right.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the midst of a thicket of strange plants, which extended in the air\r\ntheir quivering leaves, opening like hands with slender fingers, was\r\nseen the motionless figure of a man standing on the sea. The effect was\r\nsurprising. The picture, the sides of which were hidden in the moving\r\nfoliage, seemed a black spot upon a fantastic and striking horizon. It\r\nhad to be carefully looked at in order to understand it. The frame cut\r\nthe center of the ship in which were the apostles, scarcely lit up by\r\nthe oblique rays from a lantern, the full light of which one of them,\r\nseated on the bulwarks, was casting upon the approaching Savior. Jesus\r\nwas advancing with his foot upon a wave, which flattened itself\r\nsubmissively and caressingly beneath the divine tread. All was dark\r\nabout him. Only the stars shone in the sky. The faces of the apostles,\r\nin the vague light of the lantern, seemed convulsed with surprise. It\r\nwas a wonderful and unexpected work of a master; one of those works\r\nwhich agitate the mind and give you something to dream of for years.\r\nPeople who look at such things at the outset remain silent, and then go\r\nthoughtfully away, and only speak later on of the worth of the painting.\r\nDu Roy, having contemplated it for some time, said: \"It is nice to be\r\n\r\nable to afford such trifles.\"\r\n\r\nBut as he was pushed against by others coming to see it, he went away,\r\nstill keeping on his arm Susan's little hand, which he squeezed\r\nslightly. She said: \"Would you like a glass of champagne? Come to the\r\nrefreshment buffet. We shall find papa there.\"\r\n\r\nAnd they slowly passed back through the saloons, in which the crowd was\r\nincreasing, noisy and at home, the fashionable crowd of a public fete.\r\nGeorge all at once thought he heard a voice say: \"It is Laroche-Mathieu\r\nand Madame Du Roy.\" These words flitted past his ear like those distant\r\nsounds borne by the wind. Whence came they? He looked about on all\r\nsides, and indeed saw his wife passing by on the minister's arm. They\r\nwere chatting intimately in a low tone, smiling, and with their eyes\r\nfixed on one another's. He fancied he noticed that people whispered as\r\nthey looked at them, and he felt within him a stupid and brutal desire\r\nto spring upon them, these two creatures, and smite them down. She was\r\nmaking him ridiculous. He thought of Forestier. Perhaps they were\r\nsaying: \"That cuckold Du Roy.\" Who was she? A little parvenu sharp\r\nenough, but really not over-gifted with parts. People visited him\r\nbecause they feared him, because they felt his strength, but they must\r\nspeak in unrestrained fashion of this little journalistic household. He\r\nwould never make any great way with this woman, who would always render\r\nhis home a suspected one, who would always compromise herself, whose\r\nvery bearing betrayed the woman of intrigue. She would now be a cannon\r\nball riveted to his ankle. Ah! if he had only known, if he had only\r\nguessed. What a bigger game he would have played. What a fine match he\r\nmight have won with this little Susan for stakes. How was it he had been\r\nblind enough not to understand that?\r\n\r\nThey reached the dining-room--an immense apartment, with marble columns,\r\nand walls hung with old tapestry. Walter perceived his descriptive\r\nwriter, and darted forward to take him by the hands. He was intoxicated\r\nwith joy. \"Have you seen everything? Have you shown him everything,\r\nSusan? What a lot of people, eh, Pretty-boy! Did you see the Prince de\r\nGuerche? He came and drank a glass of punch here just now,\" he\r\nexclaimed.\r\n\r\nThen he darted towards the Senator Rissolin, who was towing along his\r\nwife, bewildered, and bedecked like a stall at a fair. A gentleman bowed\r\nto Susan, a tall, thin fellow, slightly bald, with yellow whiskers, and\r\nthat air of good breeding which is everywhere recognizable. George heard\r\nhis name mentioned, the Marquis de Cazolles, and became suddenly jealous\r\nof him. How long had she known him? Since her accession to wealth, no\r\ndoubt. He divined a suitor.\r\n\r\nHe was taken by the arm. It was Norbert de Varenne. The old poet was\r\nairing his long hair and worn dress-coat with a weary and indifferent\r\nair. \"This is what they call amusing themselves,\" said he. \"By and by\r\nthey will dance, and then they will go bed, and the little girls will be\r\ndelighted. Have some champagne. It is capital.\"\r\n\r\nHe had a glass filled for himself, and bowing to Du Roy, who had taken\r\nanother, said: \"I drink to the triumph of wit over wealth.\" Then he\r\nadded softly: \"Not that wealth on the part of others hurts me; or that I\r\nam angry at it. But I protest on principle.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge no longer listened to him. He was looking for Susan, who had just\r\ndisappeared with the Marquis de Cazolles, and abruptly quitting Norbert\r\nde Varenne, set out in pursuit of the young girl. A dense crowd in quest\r\nof refreshments checked him. When he at length made his way through it,\r\nhe found himself face to face with the de Marelles. He was still in the\r\nhabit of meeting the wife, but he had not for some time past met the\r\nhusband, who seized both his hands, saying: \"How can I thank you, my\r\ndear fellow, for the advice you gave me through Clotilde. I have gained\r\nclose on a hundred thousand francs over the Morocco loan. It is to you I\r\nowe them. You are a valuable friend.\"\r\n\r\nSeveral men turned round to look at the pretty and elegant brunette. Du\r\nRoy replied: \"In exchange for that service, my dear fellow, I am going\r\nto take your wife, or rather to offer her my arm. Husband and wife are\r\nbest apart, you know.\"\r\n\r\nMonsieur de Marelle bowed, saying: \"You are quite right. If I lose you,\r\nwe will meet here in an hour.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly.\"\r\n\r\nThe pair plunged into the crowd, followed by the husband. Clotilde kept\r\nsaying: \"How lucky these Walters are! That is what it is to have\r\nbusiness intelligence.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge replied: \"Bah! Clever men always make a position one way or\r\nanother.\"\r\n\r\nShe said: \"Here are two girls who will have from twenty to thirty\r\nmillions apiece. Without reckoning that Susan is pretty.\"\r\n\r\nHe said nothing. His own idea, coming from another's mouth, irritated\r\nhim. She had not yet seen the picture of \"Jesus Walking on the Water,\"\r\nand he proposed to take her to it. They amused themselves by talking\r\nscandal of the people they recognized, and making fun of those they did\r\nnot. Saint-Potin passed by, bearing on the lapel of his coat a number of\r\n\r\ndecorations, which greatly amused them. An ex-ambassador following him\r\nshowed far fewer.\r\n\r\nDu Roy remarked: \"What a mixed salad of society.\"\r\n\r\nBoisrenard, who shook hands with him, had also adorned his buttonhole\r\nwith the green and yellow ribbon worn on the day of the duel. The\r\nViscountess de Percemur, fat and bedecked, was chatting with a duke in\r\nthe little Louis XVI boudoir.\r\n\r\nGeorge whispered: \"An amorous _tete-a-tete_.\"\r\n\r\nBut on passing through the greenhouse, he noticed his wife seated beside\r\nLaroche-Mathieu, both almost hidden behind a clump of plants. They\r\nseemed to be asserting: \"We have appointed a meeting here, a meeting in\r\npublic. For we do not care a rap what people think.\"\r\n\r\nMadame de Marelle agreed that the Jesus of Karl Marcowitch was\r\nastounding, and they retraced their steps. They had lost her husband.\r\nGeorge inquired: \"And Laurine, is she still angry with me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, still so as much as ever. She refuses to see you, and walks away\r\nwhen you are spoken of.\"\r\n\r\nHe did not reply. The sudden enmity of this little girl vexed and\r\noppressed him. Susan seized on them as they passed through a doorway,\r\nexclaiming: \"Ah! here you are. Well, Pretty-boy, you must remain alone.\r\nI am going to take away Clotilde to show her my room.\"\r\n\r\nThe two moved rapidly away, gliding through the throng with that\r\nundulating snake-like motion women know how to adopt in a crowd. Almost\r\nimmediately a voice murmured: \"George.\"\r\n\r\nIt was Madame Walter, who went on in a low tone: \"Oh! how ferociously\r\ncruel you are. How you do make me suffer without reason. I told Susan to\r\nget your companion away in order to be able to say a word to you.\r\nListen, I must speak to you this evening, I must, or you don't know what\r\nI will do. Go into the conservatory. You will find a door on the left\r\nleading into the garden. Follow the path in front of it. At the end of\r\nit you will find an arbor. Wait for me there in ten minutes' time. If\r\nyou won't, I declare to you that I will create a scene here at once.\"\r\n\r\nHe replied loftily: \"Very well. I will be at the spot you mention within\r\nten minutes.\"\r\n\r\nAnd they separated. But Jacques Rival almost made him behindhand. He had\r\ntaken him by the arm and was telling him a lot of things in a very\r\nexcited manner. He had no doubt come from the refreshment buffet. At\r\nlength Du Roy left him in the hands of Monsieur de Marelle, whom he had\r\ncome across, and bolted. He still had to take precautions not to be seen\r\nby his wife or Laroche-Mathieu. He succeeded, for they seemed deeply\r\ninterested in something, and found himself in the garden. The cold air\r\nstruck him like an ice bath. He thought: \"Confound it, I shall catch\r\ncold,\" and tied his pocket-handkerchief round his neck. Then he slowly\r\nwent along the walk, seeing his way with difficulty after coming out of\r\nthe bright light of the reception-rooms. He could distinguish to the\r\nright and left leafless shrubs, the branches of which were quivering.\r\nLight filtered through their branches, coming from the windows of the\r\nmansion. He saw something white in the middle of the path in front of\r\nhim, and Madame Walter, with bare arms and bosom, said in a quivering\r\nvoice; \"Ah here you are; you want to kill me, then?\"\r\n\r\nHe answered quickly: \"No melodramatics, I beg of you, or I shall bolt at\r\nonce.\"\r\n\r\nShe had seized him round the neck, and with her lips close to his, said:\r\n\"But what have I done to you? You are behaving towards me like a wretch.\r\nWhat have I done to you?\"\r\n\r\nHe tried to repulse her. \"You wound your hair round every one of my\r\nbuttons the last time I saw you, and it almost brought about a rupture\r\nbetween my wife and myself.\"\r\n\r\nShe was surprised for a moment, and then, shaking her head, said: \"Oh!\r\nyour wife would not mind. It was one of your mistresses who had made a\r\nscene over it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no mistresses.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense. But why do you no longer ever come to see me? Why do you\r\nrefuse to come to dinner, even once a week, with me? What I suffer is\r\nfearful. I love you to that degree that I no longer have a thought that\r\nis not for you; that I see you continually before my eyes; that I can no\r\nlonger say a word without being afraid of uttering your name. You cannot\r\nunderstand that, I know. It seems to me that I am seized in some one's\r\nclutches, tied up in a sack, I don't know what. Your remembrance, always\r\nwith me, clutches my throat, tears my chest, breaks my legs so as to no\r\nlonger leave me strength to walk. And I remain like an animal sitting\r\nall day on a chair thinking of you.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked at her with astonishment. She was no longer the big frolicsome\r\ntomboy he had known, but a bewildered despairing woman, capable of\r\nanything. A vague project, however, arose in his mind. He replied: \"My\r\ndear, love is not eternal. We take and we leave one another. But when it\r\ndrags on, as between us two, it becomes a terrible drag. I will have no\r\nmore of it. That is the truth. However, if you can be reasonable, and\r\nreceive and treat me as a friend, I will come as I used to. Do you feel\r\ncapable of that?\"\r\n\r\nShe placed her two bare arms on George's coat, and murmured: \"I am\r\ncapable of anything in order to see you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then it is agreed on,\" said he; \"we are friends, and nothing more.\"\r\n\r\nShe stammered: \"It is agreed on;\" and then, holding out her lips to him:\r\n\"One more kiss; the last.\"\r\n\r\nHe refused gently, saying: \"No, we must keep to our agreement.\"\r\n\r\nShe turned aside, wiping away a couple of tears, and then, drawing from\r\nher bosom a bundle of papers tied with pink silk ribbon, offered it to\r\nDu Roy, saying: \"Here; it is your share of the profit in the Morocco\r\naffair. I was so pleased to have gained it for you. Here, take it.\"\r\n\r\nHe wanted to refuse, observing: \"No, I will not take that money.\"\r\n\r\nThen she grew indignant. \"Ah! so you won't take it now. It is yours,\r\nyours, only. If you do not take it, I will throw it into the gutter. You\r\nwon't act like that, George?\"\r\n\r\nHe received the little bundle, and slipped it into his pocket.\r\n\r\n\"We must go in,\" said he, \"you will catch cold.\"\r\n\r\nShe murmured: \"So much the better, if I could die.\"\r\n\r\nShe took one of his hands, kissed it passionately, with rage and\r\ndespair, and fled towards the mansion. He returned, quietly reflecting.\r\nThen he re-entered the conservatory with haughty forehead and smiling\r\nlip. His wife and Laroche-Mathieu were no longer there. The crowd was\r\nthinning. It was becoming evident that they would not stay for the\r\ndance. He perceived Susan arm-in-arm with her sister. They both came\r\ntowards him to ask him to dance the first quadrille with the Count de\r\nLatour Yvelin.\r\n\r\nHe was astonished, and asked: \"Who is he, too?\"\r\n\r\nSusan answered maliciously: \"A new friend of my sister's.\" Rose blushed,\r\nand murmured: \"You are very spiteful, Susan; he is no more my friend\r\nthan yours.\"\r\n\r\nSusan smiled, saying: \"Oh! I know all about it.\"\r\n\r\nRose annoyed, turned her back on them and went away. Du Roy familiarly\r\ntook the elbow of the young girl left standing beside him, and said in\r\nhis caressing voice: \"Listen, my dear, you believe me to be your\r\nfriend?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Pretty-boy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You have confidence in me?\" \"Quite.\"\r\n\r\n\"You remember what I said to you just now?\"\r\n\r\n\"What about?\"\r\n\r\n\"About your marriage, or rather about the man you are going to marry.\"\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, you will promise me one thing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; but what is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"To consult me every time that your hand is asked for, and not to accept\r\nanyone without taking my advice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well.\"\r\n\r\n\"And to keep this a secret between us two. Not a word of it to your\r\nfather or your mother.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a word.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a promise, then?\" \"It is a promise.\"\r\n\r\nRival came up with a bustling air. \"Mademoiselle, your papa wants you\r\nfor the dance.\"\r\n\r\nShe said: \"Come along, Pretty-boy.\"\r\n\r\nBut he refused, having made up his mind to leave at once, wishing to be\r\nalone in order to think. Too many new ideas had entered his mind, and he\r\nbegan to look for his wife. In a short time he saw her drinking\r\nchocolate at the buffet with two gentlemen unknown to him. She\r\nintroduced her husband without mentioning their names to him. After a\r\nfew moments, he said, \"Shall we go?\"\r\n\r\n\"When you like.\"\r\n\r\nShe took his arm, and they walked back through the reception-rooms, in\r\nwhich the public were growing few. She said: \"Where is Madame Walter, I\r\nshould like to wish her good-bye?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is better not to. She would try to keep us for the ball, and I have\r\nhad enough of this.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is so, you are quite right.\"\r\n\r\nAll the way home they were silent. But as soon as they were in their\r\nroom Madeleine said smilingly, before even taking off her veil. \"I have\r\na surprise for you.\"\r\n\r\nHe growled ill-temperedly: \"What is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Guess.\" \"I will make no such effort.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, the day after to-morrow is the first of January.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"The time for New Year's gifts.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here's one for you that Laroche-Mathieu gave me just now.\"\r\n\r\nShe gave him a little black box resembling a jewel-case. He opened it\r\nindifferently, and saw the cross of the Legion of Honor. He grew\r\nsomewhat pale, then smiled, and said: \"I should have preferred ten\r\nmillions. That did not cost him much.\"\r\n\r\nShe had expected an outburst of joy, and was irritated at this coolness.\r\n\"You are really incredible. Nothing satisfies you now,\" said she.\r\n\r\nHe replied, tranquilly: \"That man is only paying his debt, and he still\r\nowes me a great deal.\"\r\n\r\nShe was astonished at his tone, and resumed: \"It is though, a big thing\r\nat your age.\"\r\n\r\nHe remarked: \"All things are relative. I could have something bigger\r\nnow.\"\r\n\r\nHe had taken the case, and placing it on the mantel-shelf, looked for\r\nsome moments at the glittering star it contained. Then he closed it and\r\nwent to bed, shrugging his shoulders.\r\n\r\nThe _Journal Officiel_ of the first of January announced the nomination\r\nof Monsieur Prosper George Du Roy, journalist, to the dignity of\r\nchevalier of the Legion of Honor, for special services. The name was\r\nwritten in two words, which gave George more pleasure than the\r\nderivation itself.\r\n\r\nAn hour after having read this piece of news he received a note from\r\nMadame Walter begging him to come and dine with her that evening with\r\nhis wife, to celebrate his new honors. He hesitated for a few moments,\r\nand then throwing this note, written in ambiguous terms, into the fire,\r\nsaid to Madeleine:\r\n\r\n\"We are going to dinner at the Walter's this evening.\"\r\n\r\nShe was astonished. \"Why, I thought you never wanted to set foot in the\r\nhouse again.\"\r\n\r\nHe only remarked: \"I have changed my mind.\"\r\n\r\nWhen they arrived Madame Walter was alone in the little Louis XVI.\r\nboudoir she had adopted for the reception of personal friends. Dressed\r\nin black, she had powdered her hair, which rendered her charming. She\r\nhad the air at a distance of an old woman, and close at hand, of a young\r\none, and when one looked at her well, of a pretty snare for the eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You are in mourning?\" inquired Madeleine.\r\n\r\nShe replied, sadly: \"Yes, and no. I have not lost any relative. But I\r\nhave reached the age when one wears the mourning of one's life. I wear\r\nit to-day to inaugurate it. In future I shall wear it in my heart.\"\r\n\r\nDu Roy thought: \"Will this resolution hold good?\"\r\n\r\nThe dinner was somewhat dull. Susan alone chattered incessantly. Rose\r\nseemed preoccupied. The journalist was warmly congratulated. During the\r\nevening they strolled chatting through the saloons and the conservatory.\r\nAs Du Roy was walking in the rear with Madame Walter, she checked him by\r\nthe arm.\r\n\r\n\"Listen,\" said she, in a low voice, \"I will never speak to you of\r\nanything again, never. But come and see me, George. It is impossible for\r\nme to live without you, impossible. It is indescribable torture. I feel\r\nyou, I cherish you before my eyes, in my heart, all day and all night.\r\nIt is as though you had caused me to drink a poison which was eating me\r\naway within. I cannot bear it, no, I cannot bear it. I am willing to be\r\nnothing but an old woman for you. I have made my hair white to show you\r\nso, but come here, only come here from time to time as a friend.\"\r\n\r\nShe had taken his hand and was squeezing it, crushing it, burying her\r\nnails in his flesh.\r\n\r\nHe answered, quietly: \"It is understood, then. It is useless to speak of\r\nall that again. You see I came to-day at once on receiving your letter.\"\r\n\r\nWalter, who had walked on in advance with his two daughters and\r\nMadeleine, was waiting for Du Roy beside the picture of \"Jesus Walking\r\non the Waters.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fancy,\" said he, laughing, \"I found my wife yesterday on her knees\r\nbefore this picture, as if in a chapel. She was paying her devotions.\r\nHow I did laugh.\"\r\n\r\nMadame Walter replied in a firm voice--a voice thrilling with secret\r\nexultation: \"It is that Christ who will save my soul. He gives me\r\nstrength and courage every time I look at Him.\" And pausing in front of\r\nthe Divinity standing amidst the waters, she murmured: \"How handsome he\r\nis. How afraid of Him those men are, and yet how they love Him. Look at\r\nHis head, His eyes--how simple yet how supernatural at the same time.\"\r\n\r\nSusan exclaimed, \"But He resembles you, Pretty-boy. I am sure He\r\nresembles you. If you had a beard, or if He was clean shaven, you would\r\nbe both alike. Oh, but it is striking!\"\r\n\r\nShe insisted on his standing beside the picture, and they all, indeed,\r\nrecognized that the two faces resembled one another. Everyone was\r\nastonished. Walter thought it very singular. Madeleine, smiling,\r\ndeclared that Jesus had a more manly air. Madame Walter stood\r\nmotionless, gazing fixedly at the face of her lover beside the face of\r\nChrist, and had become as white as her hair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the remainder of the winter the Du Roys often visited the\r\nWalters. George even dined there by himself continually, Madeleine\r\nsaying she was tired, and preferring to remain at home. He had adopted\r\nFriday as a fixed day, and Madame Walter never invited anyone that\r\nevening; it belonged to Pretty-boy, to him alone. After dinner they\r\nplayed cards, and fed the goldfish, amusing themselves like a family\r\ncircle. Several times behind a door or a clump of shrubs in the\r\nconservatory, Madame Walter had suddenly clasped George in her arms, and\r\npressing him with all her strength to her breast, had whispered in his\r\near, \"I love you, I love you till it is killing me.\" But he had always\r\ncoldly repulsed her, replying, in a dry tone: \"If you begin that\r\nbusiness once again, I shall not come here any more.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTowards the end of March the marriage of the two sisters was all at once\r\nspoken about. Rose, it was said, was to marry the Count de\r\nLatour-Yvelin, and Susan the Marquis de Cazolles. These two gentlemen\r\nhad become familiars of the household, those familiars to whom special\r\nfavors and marked privileges are granted. George and Susan continued to\r\nlive in a species of free and fraternal intimacy, romping for hours,\r\nmaking fun of everyone, and seeming greatly to enjoy one another's\r\ncompany. They had never spoken again of the possible marriage of the\r\nyoung girl, nor of the suitors who offered themselves.\r\n\r\nThe governor had brought George home to lunch one morning. Madame Walter\r\nwas called away immediately after the repast to see one of the\r\ntradesmen, and the young fellow said to Susan: \"Let us go and feed the\r\ngoldfish.\"\r\n\r\nThey each took a piece of crumb of bread from the table and went into\r\nthe conservatory. All along the marble brim cushions were left lying on\r\nthe ground, so that one could kneel down round the basin, so as to be\r\nnearer the fish. They each took one of these, side by side, and bending\r\nover the water, began to throw in pellets of bread rolled between the\r\nfingers. The fish, as soon as they caught sight of them, flocked round,\r\nwagging their tails, waving their fins, rolling their great projecting\r\neyes, turning round, diving to catch the bait as it sank, and coming up\r\nat once to ask for more. They had a funny action of the mouth, sudden\r\nand rapid movements, a strangely monstrous appearance, and against the\r\nsand of the bottom stood out a bright red, passing like flames through\r\nthe transparent water, or showing, as soon as they halted, the blue\r\nedging to their scales. George and Susan saw their own faces looking up\r\nin the water, and smiled at them. All at once he said in a low voice:\r\n\"It is not kind to hide things from me, Susan.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean, Pretty-boy?\" asked she.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you remember, what you promised me here on the evening of the\r\nfete?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"To consult me every time your hand was asked for.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it has been asked for.\"\r\n\r\n\"By whom?\"\r\n\r\n\"You know very well.\"\r\n\r\n\"No. I swear to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you do. That great fop, the Marquis de Cazolles.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is not a fop, in the first place.\"\r\n\r\n\"It may be so, but he is stupid, ruined by play, and worn out by\r\ndissipation. It is really a nice match for you, so pretty, so fresh, and\r\nso intelligent.\"\r\n\r\nShe inquired, smiling: \"What have you against him?\"\r\n\r\n\"I, nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you have. He is not all that you say.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense. He is a fool and an intriguer.\"\r\n\r\nShe turned round somewhat, leaving off looking into the water, and said:\r\n\"Come, what is the matter with you?\"\r\n\r\nHe said, as though a secret was being wrenched from the bottom of his\r\nheart: \"I--I--am jealous of him.\"\r\n\r\nShe was slightly astonished, saying: \"You?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I am in love with you, and you know it very well, you naughty\r\ngirl.\"\r\n\r\nShe said, in a severe tone: \"You are mad, Pretty-boy.\"\r\n\r\nHe replied; \"I know very well that I am mad. Ought I to have admitted\r\nthat--I, a married man, to you, a young girl? I am more than mad, I am\r\nguilty. I have no possible hope, and the thought of that drives me out\r\nof my senses. And when I hear it said that you are going to be married,\r\nI have fits of rage enough to kill someone. You must forgive me this,\r\nSusan.\"\r\n\r\nHe was silent. The whole of the fish, to whom bread was no longer being\r\nthrown, were motionless, drawn up in line like English soldiers, and\r\nlooking at the bent heads of those two who were no longer troubling\r\nthemselves about them. The young girl murmured, half sadly, half gayly:\r\n\"It is a pity that you are married. What would you? Nothing can be done.\r\nIt is settled.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned suddenly towards her, and said right in her face: \"If I were\r\nfree, would you marry me?\"\r\n\r\nShe replied, in a tone of sincerity: \"Yes, Pretty-boy, I would marry\r\nyou, for you please me far better than any of the others.\"\r\n\r\nHe rose, and stammered: \"Thanks, thanks; do not say 'yes' to anyone yet,\r\nI beg of you; wait a little longer, I entreat you. Will you promise me\r\nthis much?\"\r\n\r\nShe murmured, somewhat uneasily, and without understanding what he\r\nwanted: \"Yes, I promise you.\"\r\n\r\nDu Roy threw the lump of bread he still held in his hand into the water,\r\nand fled as though he had lost his head, without wishing her good-bye.\r\nAll the fish rushed eagerly at this lump of crumb, which floated, not\r\nhaving been kneaded in the fingers, and nibbled it with greedy mouths.\r\nThey dragged it away to the other end of the basin, and forming a moving\r\ncluster, a kind of animated and twisting flower, a live flower fallen\r\ninto the water head downwards.\r\n\r\nSusan, surprised and uneasy, got up and returned slowly to the\r\ndining-room. The journalist had left.\r\n\r\nHe came home very calm, and as Madeleine was writing letters, said to\r\nher: \"Are you going to dine at the Walters' on Friday? I am going.\"\r\n\r\nShe hesitated, and replied: \"No. I do not feel very well. I would rather\r\nstay at home.\"\r\n\r\nHe remarked: \"Just as you like.\"\r\n\r\nThen he took his hat and went out again at once. For some time past he\r\nhad been keeping watch over her, following her about, knowing all her\r\nmovements. The hour he had been awaiting was at length at hand. He had\r\nnot been deceived by the tone in which she had said: \"I would rather\r\nstay at home.\"\r\n\r\nHe was very amiable towards her during the next few days. He even\r\nappeared lively, which was not usual, and she said: \"You are growing\r\nquite nice again.\"\r\n\r\nHe dressed early on the Friday, in order to make some calls before going\r\nto the governor's, he said. He started just before six, after kissing\r\nhis wife, and went and took a cab at the Place Notre Dame de Lorette. He\r\nsaid to the driver: \"Pull up in front of No. 17, Rue Fontaine, and stay\r\nthere till I tell you to go on again. Then drive to the Cock Pheasant\r\nrestaurant in the Rue Lafayette.\"\r\n\r\nThe cab started at a slow trot, and Du Roy drew down the blinds. As soon\r\nas he was opposite the door he did not take his eyes off it. After\r\nwaiting ten minutes he saw Madeleine come out and go in the direction of\r\nthe outer boulevards. As soon as she had got far enough off he put his\r\nhead through the window, and said to the driver: \"Go on.\" The cab\r\nstarted again, and landed him in front of the Cock Pheasant, a\r\nwell-known middle-class restaurant. George went into the main\r\ndining-room and ate slowly, looking at his watch from time to time. At\r\nhalf-past seven, when he had finished his coffee, drank two liqueurs of\r\nbrandy, and slowly smoked a good cigar, he went out, hailed another cab\r\nthat was going by empty, and was driven to the Rue La Rochefoucauld. He\r\nascended without making any inquiry of the doorkeeper, to the third\r\nstory of the house he had told the man to drive to, and when a servant\r\nopened the door to him, said: \"Monsieur Guibert de Lorme is at home, is\r\nhe not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes sir.\"\r\n\r\nHe was ushered into the drawing-room, where he waited for a few minutes.\r\nThen a gentleman came in, tall, and with a military bearing, gray-haired\r\nthough still young, and wearing the ribbon of the Legion of Honor. Du\r\nRoy bowed, and said: \"As I foresaw, Mr. Commissionary, my wife is now\r\ndining with her lover in the furnished rooms they have hired in the Rue\r\ndes Martyrs.\"\r\n\r\nThe commissary of police bowed, saying: \"I am at your service, sir.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge continued: \"You have until nine o'clock, have you not? That limit\r\nof time passed, you can no longer enter a private dwelling to prove\r\nadultery.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir; seven o'clock in winter, nine o'clock from the 31st March. It\r\nis the 5th of April, so we have till nine o'clock.\r\n\r\n\"Very well, Mr. Commissionary, I have a cab downstairs; we can take the\r\nofficers who will accompany you, and wait a little before the door. The\r\nlater we arrive the best chance we have of catching them in the act.\"\r\n\r\n\"As you like, sir.\"\r\n\r\nThe commissary left the room, and then returned with an overcoat, hiding\r\nhis tri-colored sash. He drew back to let Du Roy pass out first. But the\r\njournalist, who was preoccupied, declined to do so, and kept saying:\r\n\"After you, sir, after you.\"\r\n\r\nThe commissary said: \"Go first, sir, I am at home.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge bowed, and passed out. They went first to the police office to\r\npick up three officers in plain clothes who were awaiting them, for\r\nGeorge had given notice during the day that the surprise would take\r\nplace that evening. One of the men got on the box beside the driver. The\r\nother two entered the cab, which reached the Rue des Martyrs. Du Roy\r\nsaid: \"I have a plan of the rooms. They are on the second floor. We\r\nshall first find a little ante-room, then a dining-room, then the\r\nbedroom. The three rooms open into one another. There is no way out to\r\nfacilitate flight. There is a locksmith a little further on. He is\r\nholding himself in readiness to be called upon by you.\"\r\n\r\nWhen they arrived opposite the house it was only a quarter past eight,\r\nand they waited in silence for more than twenty minutes. But when he\r\nsaw the three quarters about to strike, George said: \"Let us start now.\"\r\n\r\nThey went up the stairs without troubling themselves about the\r\ndoorkeeper, who, indeed, did not notice them. One of the officers\r\nremained in the street to keep watch on the front door. The four men\r\nstopped at the second floor, and George put his ear to the door and then\r\nlooked through the keyhole. He neither heard nor saw anything. He rang\r\nthe bell.\r\n\r\nThe commissary said to the officers: \"You will remain in readiness till\r\ncalled on.\"\r\n\r\nAnd they waited. At the end of two or three minutes George again pulled\r\nthe bell several times in succession. They noted a noise from the\r\nfurther end of the rooms, and then a slight step approached. Someone was\r\ncoming to spy who was there. The journalist then rapped smartly on the\r\npanel of the door. A voice, a woman's voice, that an attempt was\r\nevidently being made to disguise asked: \"Who is there?\"\r\n\r\nThe commissary replied: \"Open, in the name of the law.\"\r\n\r\nThe voice repeated: \"Who are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am the commissary of police. Open the door, or I will have it broken\r\nin.\"\r\n\r\nThe voice went on: \"What do you want?\"\r\n\r\nDu Roy said: \"It is I. It is useless to seek to escape.\"\r\n\r\nThe light steps, the tread of bare feet, was heard to withdraw, and then\r\nin a few seconds to return.\r\n\r\nGeorge said: \"If you won't open, we will break in the door.\"\r\n\r\nHe grasped the handle, and pushed slowly with his shoulder. As there\r\nwas no longer any reply, he suddenly gave such a violent and vigorous\r\nshock that the old lock gave way. The screws were torn out of the wood,\r\nand he almost fell over Madeleine, who was standing in the ante-room,\r\nclad in a chemise and petticoat, her hair down, her legs bare, and a\r\ncandle in her hand.\r\n\r\nHe exclaimed: \"It is she, we have them,\" and darted forward into the\r\nrooms. The commissary, having taken off his hat, followed him, and the\r\nstartled woman came after, lighting the way. They crossed a\r\ndrawing-room, the uncleaned table of which displayed the remnants of a\r\nrepast--empty champagne bottles, an open pot of fatted goose liver, the\r\nbody of a fowl, and some half-eaten bits of bread. Two plates piled on\r\nthe sideboard were piled with oyster shells.\r\n\r\nThe bedroom seemed disordered, as though by a struggle. A dress was\r\nthrown over a chair, a pair of trousers hung astride the arm of another.\r\nFour boots, two large and two small, lay on their sides at the foot of\r\nthe bed. It was the room of a house let out in furnished lodgings, with\r\ncommonplace furniture, filled with that hateful and sickening smell of\r\nall such places, the odor of all the people who had slept or lived there\r\na day or six months. A plate of cakes, a bottle of chartreuse, and two\r\nliqueur glasses, still half full, encumbered the mantel-shelf. The upper\r\npart of the bronze clock was hidden by a man's hat.\r\n\r\nThe commissary turned round sharply, and looking Madeleine straight in\r\nthe face, said: \"You are Madame Claire Madeleine Du Roy, wife of\r\nMonsieur Prosper George Du Roy, journalist, here present?\"\r\n\r\nShe uttered in a choking voice: \"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you doing here?\" She did not answer.\r\n\r\nThe commissary went on: \"What are you doing here? I find you away from\r\nhome, almost undressed, in furnished apartments. What did you come here\r\nfor?\" He waited for a few moments. Then, as she still remained silent,\r\nhe continued: \"Since you will not confess, madame, I shall be obliged to\r\nverify the state of things.\"\r\n\r\nIn the bed could be seen the outline of a form hidden beneath the\r\nclothes. The commissary approached and said: \"Sir.\"\r\n\r\nThe man in bed did not stir. He seemed to have his back turned, and his\r\nhead buried under a pillow. The commissary touched what seemed to be his\r\nshoulder, and said: \"Sir, do not, I beg of you, force me to take\r\naction.\"\r\n\r\nBut the form still remained as motionless as a corpse. Du Roy, who had\r\nadvanced quickly, seized the bed-clothes, pulled them down, and tearing\r\naway the pillow, revealed the pale face of Monsieur Laroche-Mathieu. He\r\nbent over him, and, quivering with the desire to seize him by the throat\r\nand strangle him, said, between his clenched teeth: \"Have at least the\r\ncourage of your infamy.\"\r\n\r\nThe commissary again asked: \"Who are you?\"\r\n\r\nThe bewildered lover not replying, he continued: \"I am a commissary of\r\npolice, and I summon you to tell me your name.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge, who was quivering with brutal wrath, shouted: \"Answer, you\r\ncoward, or I will tell your name myself.\"\r\n\r\nThen the man in the bed stammered: \"Mr. Commissary, you ought not to\r\nallow me to be insulted by this person. Is it with you or with him that\r\nI have to do? Is it to you or to him that I have to answer?\"\r\n\r\nHis mouth seemed to be dried up as he spoke.\r\n\r\nThe commissary replied: \"With me, sir; with me alone. I ask you who you\r\nare?\"\r\n\r\nThe other was silent. He held the sheet close up to his neck, and rolled\r\nhis startled eyes. His little, curled-up moustache showed up black upon\r\nhis blanched face.\r\n\r\nThe commissary continued: \"You will not answer, eh? Then I shall be\r\nforced to arrest you. In any case, get up. I will question you when you\r\nare dressed.\"\r\n\r\nThe body wriggled in the bed, and the head murmured: \"But I cannot,\r\nbefore you.\"\r\n\r\nThe commissary asked: \"Why not?\"\r\n\r\nThe other stammered: \"Because I am--I am--quite naked.\"\r\n\r\nDu Roy began to chuckle sneeringly, and picking up a shirt that had\r\nfallen onto the floor, threw it onto the bed, exclaiming: \"Come, get up.\r\nSince you have undressed in my wife's presence, you can very well dress\r\nin mine.\"\r\n\r\nThen he turned his back, and returned towards the fireplace. Madeleine\r\nhad recovered all her coolness, and seeing that all was lost, was ready\r\nto dare anything. Her eyes glittered with bravado, and twisting up a\r\npiece of paper she lit, as though for a reception, the ten candles in\r\nthe ugly candelabra, placed at the corners of the mantel-shelf. Then,\r\nleaning against this, and holding out backwards to the dying fire one of\r\nher bare feet which she lifted up behind the petticoat, scarcely\r\nsticking to her hips, she took a cigarette from a pink paper case, lit\r\nit, and began to smoke. The commissary had returned towards her, pending\r\nthat her accomplice got up.\r\n\r\nShe inquired insolently: \"Do you often have such jobs as these, sir?\"\r\n\r\nHe replied gravely: \"As seldom as possible, madame.\"\r\n\r\nShe smiled in his face, saying: \"I congratulate you; it is dirty work.\"\r\n\r\nShe affected not to look at or even to see her husband.\r\n\r\nBut the gentleman in the bed was dressing. He had put on his trousers,\r\npulled on his boots, and now approached putting on his waistcoat. The\r\ncommissary turned towards him, saying: \"Now, sir, will you tell me who\r\nyou are?\"\r\n\r\nHe made no reply, and the official said: \"I find myself obliged to\r\narrest you.\"\r\n\r\nThen the man exclaimed suddenly: \"Do not lay hands on me. My person is\r\ninviolable.\"\r\n\r\nDu Roy darted towards him as though to throw him down, and growled in\r\nhis face: \"Caught in the act, in the act. I can have you arrested if I\r\nchoose; yes, I can.\" Then, in a ringing tone, he added: \"This man is\r\nLaroche-Mathieu, Minister of Foreign Affairs.\"\r\n\r\nThe commissary drew back, stupefied, and stammered: \"Really, sir, will\r\nyou tell me who you are?\"\r\n\r\nThe other had made up his mind, and said in forcible tones: \"For once\r\nthat scoundrel has not lied. I am, indeed, Laroche-Mathieu, the\r\nminister.\" Then, holding out his hand towards George's chest, in which a\r\nlittle bit of red ribbon showed itself, he added: \"And that rascal wears\r\non his coat the cross of honor which I gave him.\"\r\n\r\nDu Roy had become livid. With a rapid movement he tore the bit of ribbon\r\nfrom his buttonhole, and, throwing it into the fireplace, exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"That is all that is fit for a decoration coming from a swine like\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nThey were quite close, face to face, exasperated, their fists clenched,\r\nthe one lean, with a flowing moustache, the other stout, with a twisted\r\none. The commissary stepped rapidly between the pair, and pushing them\r\napart with his hands, observed: \"Gentlemen, you are forgetting\r\nyourselves; you are lacking in self-respect.\"\r\n\r\nThey became quiet and turned on their heels. Madeleine, motionless, was\r\nstill smoking in silence.\r\n\r\nThe police official resumed: \"Sir, I have found you alone with Madame Du\r\nRoy here, you in bed, she almost naked, with your clothes scattered\r\nabout the room. This is legal evidence of adultery. You cannot deny this\r\nevidence. What have you to say for yourself?\"\r\n\r\nLaroche-Mathieu murmured: \"I have nothing to say; do your duty.\"\r\n\r\nThe commissary addressed himself to Madeleine: \"Do you admit, madame,\r\nthat this gentleman is your lover?\"\r\n\r\nShe said with a certain swagger: \"I do not deny it; he is my lover.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"That is enough.\"\r\n\r\nThe commissary made some notes as to the condition and arrangement of\r\nthe rooms. As he was finishing writing, the minister, who had finished\r\ndressing, and was waiting with his greatcoat over his arm and his hat in\r\nhis hand, said: \"Have you still need of me, sir? What am I to do? Can I\r\nwithdraw?\"\r\n\r\nDu Roy turned towards him, and smiling insolently, said: \"Why so? We\r\nhave finished. You can go to bed again, sir; we will leave you alone.\"\r\nAnd placing a finger on the official's arm, he continued: \"Let us\r\nretire, Mr. Commissary, we have nothing more to do in this place.\"\r\n\r\nSomewhat surprised, the commissary followed, but on the threshold of the\r\nroom George stopped to allow him to pass. The other declined, out of\r\npoliteness. Du Roy persisted, saying: \"Pass first, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"After you, sir,\" replied the commissary.\r\n\r\nThe journalist bowed, and in a tone of ironical politeness, said: \"It is\r\nyour turn, sir; I am almost at home here.\"\r\n\r\nThen he softly reclosed the door with an air of discretion.\r\n\r\nAn hour later George Du Roy entered the offices of the _Vie Francaise_.\r\nMonsieur Walter was already there, for he continued to manage and\r\nsupervise with solicitude his paper, which had enormously increased in\r\ncirculation, and greatly helped the schemes of his bank. The manager\r\nraised his head and said: \"Ah! here you are. You look very strange. Why\r\ndid you not come to dinner with us? What have you been up to?\"\r\n\r\nThe young fellow, sure of his effect, said, emphasizing every word: \"I\r\n\r\nhave just upset the Minister of Foreign Affairs.\"\r\n\r\nThe other thought he was joking, and said: \"Upset what?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am going to turn out the Cabinet. That is all. It is quite time to\r\nget rid of that rubbish.\"\r\n\r\nThe old man thought that his leader-writer must be drunk. He murmured:\r\n\"Come, you are talking nonsense.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all. I have just caught Monsieur Laroche-Mathieu committing\r\nadultery with my wife. The commissary of police has verified the fact.\r\nThe minister is done for.\"\r\n\r\nWalter, amazed, pushed his spectacles right back on his forehead, and\r\nsaid: \"You are not joking?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all. I am even going to write an article on it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what do you want to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"To upset that scoundrel, that wretch, that open evil-doer.\" George\r\nplaced his hat on an armchair, and added: \"Woe to those who cross my\r\npath. I never forgive.\"\r\n\r\nThe manager still hesitated at understanding matters. He murmured:\r\n\"But--your wife?\"\r\n\r\n\"My application for a divorce will be lodged to-morrow morning. I shall\r\nsend her back to the departed Forestier.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean to get a divorce?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. I was ridiculous. But I had to play the idiot in order to catch\r\nthem. That's done. I am master of the situation.\"\r\n\r\nMonsieur Walter could not get over it, and watched Du Roy with startling\r\neyes, thinking: \"Hang it, here is a fellow to be looked after.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge went on: \"I am now free. I have some money. I shall offer myself\r\nas a candidate at the October elections for my native place, where I am\r\nwell known. I could not take a position or make myself respected with\r\nthat woman, who was suspected by every one. She had caught me like a\r\nfool, humbugged and ensnared me. But since I became alive to her little\r\ngame I kept watch on her, the slut.\" He began to laugh, and added: \"It\r\nwas poor Forestier who was cuckold, a cuckold without imagining it,\r\nconfiding and tranquil. Now I am free from the leprosy he left me. My\r\nhands are free. Now I shall get on.\" He had seated himself astride a\r\nchair, and repeated, as though thinking aloud, \"I shall get on.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Daddy Walter, still looking at him with unveiled eyes, his\r\nspectacles remaining pushed up on his forehead, said to himself: \"Yes,\r\nhe will get on, the rascal.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge rose. \"I am going to write the article. It must be done\r\ndiscreetly. But you know it will be terrible for the minister. He has\r\ngone to smash. He cannot be picked up again. The _Vie Francaise_ has no\r\nlonger any interest to spare him.\"\r\n\r\nThe old fellow hesitated for a few moments, and then made up his mind.\r\n\"Do so,\" said he; \"so much the worse for those who get into such\r\nmesses.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII\r\n\r\n\r\nThree months had elapsed. Du Roy's divorce had just been granted. His\r\nwife had resumed the name of Forestier, and, as the Walters were to\r\nleave on the 15th of July for Trouville, it was decided that he and they\r\nshould spend a day in the country together before they started. A\r\nThursday was selected, and they started at nine in the morning in a\r\nlarge traveling landau with six places, drawn by four horses with\r\npostilions. They were going to lunch at the Pavilion Henri-Quatre at\r\nSaint Germain. Pretty-boy had asked to be the only man of the party, for\r\nhe could not endure the presence of the Marquis de Cazolles. But at the\r\nlast moment it was decided that the Count de Latour-Yvelin should be\r\ncalled for on the way. He had been told the day before.\r\n\r\nThe carriage passed up the Avenue of the Champs Elysees at a swinging\r\ntrot, and then traversed the Bois de Boulogne. It was splendid summer\r\nweather, not too warm. The swallows traced long sweeping lines across\r\nthe blue sky that one fancied one could still see after they had passed.\r\nThe three ladies occupied the back seat, the mother between her\r\ndaughters, and the men were with their backs to the horses, Walter\r\nbetween the two guests. They crossed the Seine, skirted Mount Valerien,\r\nand gained Bougival in order to follow the river as far as Le Pecq.\r\n\r\nThe Count de Latour-Yvelin, a man advancing towards middle-age, with\r\nlong, light whiskers, gazed tenderly at Rose. They had been engaged for\r\na month. George, who was very pale, often looked at Susan, who was pale\r\ntoo. Their eyes often met, and seemed to concert something, to\r\nunderstand one another, to secretly exchange a thought, and then to flee\r\none another. Madame Walter was quiet and happy.\r\n\r\nThe lunch was a long one. Before starting back for Paris, George\r\nsuggested a turn on the terrace. They stopped at first to admire the\r\nview. All ranged themselves in a line along the parapet, and went into\r\necstasies over the far-stretching horizon. The Seine at the foot of a\r\nlong hill flowed towards Maisons-Lafitte like an immense serpent\r\nstretched in the herbage. To the right, on the summit of the slope, the\r\naqueduct of Marly showed against the skyline its outline, resembling\r\nthat of a gigantic, long-legged caterpillar, and Marly was lost beneath\r\nit in a thick cluster of trees. On the immense plain extending in front\r\nof them, villages could be seen dotted. The pieces of water at Le\r\nVesinet showed like clear spots amidst the thin foliage of the little\r\nforest. To the left, away in the distance, the pointed steeple of\r\nSastrouville could be seen.\r\n\r\nWalter said: \"Such a panorama is not to be found anywhere in the world.\r\nThere is not one to match it in Switzerland.\"\r\n\r\nThen they began to walk on gently, to have a stroll and enjoy the\r\nprospect. George and Susan remained behind. As soon as they were a few\r\npaces off, he said to her in a low and restrained voice: \"Susan, I adore\r\nyou. I love you to madness.\"\r\n\r\nShe murmured: \"So do I you, Pretty-boy.\"\r\n\r\nHe went on: \"If I do not have you for my wife, I shall leave Paris and\r\nthis country.\"\r\n\r\nShe replied: \"Ask Papa for my hand. Perhaps he will consent.\"\r\n\r\nHe made a gesture of impatience. \"No, I tell you for the twentieth time\r\nthat is useless. The door of your house would be closed to me. I should\r\nbe dismissed from the paper, and we should not be able even to see one\r\nanother. That is a pretty result, at which I am sure to arrive by a\r\nformal demand for you. They have promised you to the Marquis de\r\nCazolles. They hope that you will end by saying 'yes,' and they are\r\nwaiting for that.\"\r\n\r\nShe asked: \"What is to be done?\"\r\n\r\nHe hesitated, glancing at her, sidelong fashion. \"Do you love me enough\r\nto run a risk?\"\r\n\r\nShe answered resolutely: \"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"A great risk?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"The greatest of risks?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you the courage to set your father and mother at defiance?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Really now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, there is one way and only one. The thing must come from you\r\nand not from me. You are a spoilt child; they let you say whatever you\r\nlike, and they will not be too much astonished at an act of daring the\r\nmore on your part. Listen, then. This evening, on reaching home, you\r\nmust go to your mamma first, your mamma alone, and tell her you want to\r\nmarry me. She will be greatly moved and very angry--\"\r\n\r\nSusan interrupted him with: \"Oh, mamma will agree.\"\r\n\r\nHe went on quickly: \"No, you do not know her. She will be more vexed and\r\nangrier than your father. You will see how she will refuse. But you must\r\nbe firm, you must not give way, you must repeat that you want to marry\r\nme, and no one else. Will you do this?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will.\"\r\n\r\n\"On leaving your mother you must tell your father the same thing in a\r\nvery serious and decided manner.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes; and then?\"\r\n\r\n\"And then it is that matters become serious. If you are determined, very\r\ndetermined--very, very determined to be my wife, my dear, dear little\r\nSusan--I will--run away with you.\"\r\n\r\nShe experienced a joyful shock, and almost clapped her hands. \"Oh! how\r\ndelightful. You will run away with me. When will you run away with me?\"\r\n\r\nAll the old poetry of nocturnal elopements, post-chaises, country inns;\r\nall the charming adventures told in books, flashed through her mind,\r\nlike an enchanting dream about to be realized. She repeated: \"When will\r\nyou run away with me?\"\r\n\r\nHe replied, in low tones: \"This evening--to-night.\"\r\n\r\nShe asked, quivering: \"And where shall we go to?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is my secret. Reflect on what you are doing. Remember that after\r\nsuch a flight you can only be my wife. It is the only way, but is--it is\r\nvery dangerous--for you.\"\r\n\r\nShe declared: \"I have made up my mind; where shall I rejoin you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you get out of the hotel alone?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. I know how to undo the little door.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, when the doorkeeper has gone to bed, towards midnight, come and\r\nmeet me on the Place de la Concorde. You will find me in a cab drawn up\r\nin front of the Ministry of Marine.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will come.\"\r\n\r\n\"Really?\"\r\n\r\n\"Really.\"\r\n\r\nHe took her hand and pressed it. \"Oh! how I love you. How good and brave\r\nyou are! So you don't want to marry Monsieur de Cazolles?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! no.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your father was very angry when you said no?\"\r\n\r\n\"I should think so. He wanted to send me back to the convent.\"\r\n\r\n\"You see that it is necessary to be energetic.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will be so.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked at the vast horizon, her head full of the idea of being ran\r\noff with. She would go further than that with him. She would be ran away\r\nwith. She was proud of it. She scarcely thought of her reputation--of\r\nwhat shame might befall her. Was she aware of it? Did she even suspect\r\nit?\r\n\r\nMadame Walter, turning round, exclaimed: \"Come along, little one. What\r\nare you doing with Pretty-boy?\"\r\n\r\nThey rejoined the others and spoke of the seaside, where they would soon\r\nbe. Then they returned home by way of Chatou, in order not to go over\r\nthe same road twice. George no longer spoke. He reflected. If the little\r\ngirl had a little courage, he was going to succeed at last. For three\r\nmonths he had been enveloping her in the irresistible net of his love.\r\nHe was seducing, captivating, conquering her. He had made himself loved\r\nby her, as he knew how to make himself loved. He had captured her\r\nchildish soul without difficulty. He had at first obtained of her that\r\nshe should refuse Monsieur de Cazolles. He had just obtained that she\r\nwould fly with him. For there was no other way. Madame Walter, he well\r\nunderstood, would never agree to give him her daughter. She still loved\r\nhim; she would always love him with unmanageable violence. He restrained\r\nher by his studied coldness; but he felt that she was eaten up by hungry\r\nand impotent passion. He could never bend her. She would never allow him\r\nto have Susan. But once he had the girl away he would deal on a level\r\nfooting with her father. Thinking of all this, he replied by broken\r\nphrases to the remarks addressed to him, and which he did not hear. He\r\nonly seemed to come to himself when they returned to Paris.\r\n\r\nSusan, too, was thinking, and the bells of the four horses rang in her\r\nears, making her see endless miles of highway under eternal moonlight,\r\ngloomy forests traversed, wayside inns, and the hurry of the hostlers to\r\nchange horses, for every one guesses that they are pursued.\r\n\r\nWhen the landau entered the court-yard of the mansion, they wanted to\r\nkeep George to dinner. He refused, and went home. After having eaten a\r\nlittle, he went through his papers as if about to start on a long\r\njourney. He burnt some compromising letters, hid others, and wrote to\r\nsome friends. From time to time he looked at the clock, thinking:\r\n\"Things must be getting warm there.\" And a sense of uneasiness gnawed at\r\nhis heart. Suppose he was going to fail? But what could he fear? He\r\ncould always get out of it. Yet it was a big game he was playing that\r\nevening.\r\n\r\nHe went out towards eleven o'clock, wandered about some time, took a\r\ncab, and had it drawn up in the Place de la Concorde, by the Ministry of\r\nMarine. From time to time he struck a match to see the time by his\r\nwatch. When he saw midnight approaching, his impatience became feverish.\r\nEvery moment he thrust his head out of the window to look. A distant\r\nclock struck twelve, then another nearer, then two together, then a last\r\none, very far away. When the latter had ceased to sound, he thought: \"It\r\nis all over. It is a failure. She won't come.\" He had made up his mind,\r\nhowever, to wait till daylight. In these matters one must be patient.\r\n\r\nHe heard the quarter strike, then the half-hour, then the quarter to,\r\nand all the clocks repeated \"one,\" as they had announced midnight. He no\r\nlonger expected her; he was merely remaining, racking his brain to\r\ndivine what could have happened. All at once a woman's head was passed\r\nthrough the window, and asked: \"Are you there, Pretty-boy?\"\r\n\r\nHe started, almost choked with emotion, \"Is that you, Susan?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it is I.\"\r\n\r\nHe could not manage to turn the handle quickly enough, and repeated:\r\n\"Ah! it is you, it is you; come inside.\"\r\n\r\nShe came in and fell against him. He said, \"Go on,\" to the driver, and\r\nthe cab started.\r\n\r\nShe gasped, without saying a word.\r\n\r\nHe asked: \"Well, how did it go off?\"\r\n\r\nShe murmured, almost fainting: \"Oh! it was terrible, above all with\r\nmamma.\"\r\n\r\nHe was uneasy and quivering. \"Your mamma. What did she say? Tell me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! it was awful. I went into her room and told her my little story\r\nthat I had carefully prepared. She grew pale, and then she cried:\r\n'Never, never.' I cried, I grew angry. I vowed I would marry no one but\r\nyou. I thought that she was going to strike me. She went on just as if\r\nshe were mad; she declared that I should be sent back to the convent the\r\nnext day. I had never seen her like that--never. Then papa came in,\r\nhearing her shouting all her nonsense. He was not so angry as she was,\r\nbut he declared that you were not a good enough match. As they had put\r\nme in a rage, too, I shouted louder than they did. And papa told me to\r\nleave the room, with a melodramatic air that did not suit him at all.\r\nThis is what decided me to run off with you. Here I am. Where are we\r\ngoing to?\"\r\n\r\nHe had passed his arm gently round her and was listening with all his\r\nears, his heart throbbing, and a ravenous hatred awakening within him\r\nagainst these people. But he had got their daughter. They should just\r\nsee.\r\n\r\nHe answered: \"It is too late to catch a train, so this cab will take us\r\nto Sevres, where we shall pass the night. To-morrow we shall start for\r\nLa Roche-Guyon. It is a pretty village on the banks of the Seine,\r\nbetween Nantes and Bonnieres.\"\r\n\r\nShe murmured: \"But I have no clothes. I have nothing.\"\r\n\r\nHe smiled carelessly: \"Bah! we will arrange all that there.\"\r\n\r\nThe cab rolled along the street. George took one of the young girl's\r\nhands and began to kiss it slowly and with respect. He scarcely knew\r\nwhat to say to her, being scarcely accustomed to platonic love-making.\r\nBut all at once he thought he noted that she was crying. He inquired,\r\nwith alarm: \"What is the matter with you, darling?\"\r\n\r\nShe replied in tearful tones: \"Poor mamma, she will not be able to sleep\r\nif she has found out my departure.\"\r\n\r\nHer mother, indeed, was not asleep.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Susan had left the room, Madame Walter remained face to face\r\nwith her husband. She asked, bewildered and cast down: \"Good heavens!\r\nWhat is the meaning of this?\"\r\n\r\nWalter exclaimed furiously: \"It means that that schemer has bewitched\r\nher. It is he who made her refuse Cazolles. He thinks her dowry worth\r\ntrying for.\" He began to walk angrily up and down the room, and went\r\non: \"You were always luring him here, too, yourself; you flattered him,\r\nyou cajoled him, you could not cosset him enough. It was Pretty-boy\r\nhere, Pretty-boy there, from morning till night, and this is the return\r\nfor it.\"\r\n\r\nShe murmured, livid: \"I--I lured him?\"\r\n\r\nHe shouted in her face: \"Yes, you. You were all mad over him--Madame de\r\nMarelle, Susan, and the rest. Do you think I did not see that you could\r\nnot pass a couple of days without having him here?\"\r\n\r\nShe drew herself up tragically: \"I will not allow you to speak to me\r\nlike that. You forget that I was not brought up like you, behind a\r\ncounter.\"\r\n\r\nHe stood for a moment stupefied, and then uttered a furious \"Damn it\r\nall!\" and rushed out, slamming the door after him. As soon as she was\r\nalone she went instinctively to the glass to see if anything was changed\r\nin her, so impossible and monstrous did what had happened appear. Susan\r\nin love with Pretty-boy, and Pretty-boy wanting to marry Susan! No, she\r\nwas mistaken; it was not true. The girl had had a very natural fancy for\r\nthis good-looking fellow; she had hoped that they would give him her for\r\na husband, and had made her little scene because she wanted to have her\r\nown way. But he--he could not be an accomplice in that. She reflected,\r\ndisturbed, as one in presence of great catastrophes. No, Pretty-boy\r\ncould know nothing of Susan's prank.\r\n\r\nShe thought for a long time over the possible innocence or perfidy of\r\nthis man. What a scoundrel, if he had prepared the blow! And what would\r\nhappen! What dangers and tortures she foresaw. If he knew nothing, all\r\ncould yet be arranged. They would travel about with Susan for six\r\nmonths, and it would be all over. But how could she meet him herself\r\nafterwards? For she still loved him. This passion had entered into her\r\nbeing like those arrowheads that cannot be withdrawn. To live without\r\nhim was impossible. She might as well die.\r\n\r\nHer thoughts wandered amidst these agonies and uncertainties. A pain\r\nbegan in her head; her ideas became painful and disturbed. She worried\r\nherself by trying to work things out; grew mad at not knowing. She\r\nlooked at the clock; it was past one. She said to herself: \"I cannot\r\nremain like this, I shall go mad. I must know. I will wake up Susan and\r\nquestion her.\"\r\n\r\nShe went barefooted, in order not to make a noise, and with a candle in\r\nher hand, towards her daughter's room. She opened the door softly, went\r\nin, and looked at the bed. She did not comprehend matters at first, and\r\nthought that the girl might still be arguing with her father. But all at\r\nonce a horrible suspicion crossed her mind, and she rushed to her\r\nhusband's room. She reached it in a bound, blanched and panting. He was\r\nin bed reading.\r\n\r\nHe asked, startled: \"Well, what is it? What is the matter with you?\"\r\n\r\nShe stammered: \"Have you seen Susan?\"\r\n\r\n\"I? No. Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"She has--she has--gone! She is not in her room.\"\r\n\r\nHe sprang onto the carpet, thrust his feet into his slippers, and, with\r\nhis shirt tails floating in the air, rushed in turn to his daughter's\r\nroom. As soon as he saw it, he no longer retained any doubt. She had\r\nfled. He dropped into a chair and placed his lamp on the ground in\r\nfront of him.\r\n\r\nHis wife had rejoined him, and stammered: \"Well?\"\r\n\r\nHe had no longer the strength to reply; he was no longer enraged, he\r\nonly groaned: \"It is done; he has got her. We are done for.\"\r\n\r\nShe did not understand, and said: \"What do you mean? done for?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, by Jove! He will certainly marry her now.\"\r\n\r\nShe gave a cry like that of a wild beast: \"He, never! You must be mad!\"\r\n\r\nHe replied, sadly: \"It is no use howling. He has run away with her, he\r\nhas dishonored her. The best thing is to give her to him. By setting to\r\nwork in the right way no one will be aware of this escapade.\"\r\n\r\nShe repeated, shaken by terrible emotion: \"Never, never; he shall never\r\nhave Susan. I will never consent.\"\r\n\r\nWalter murmured, dejectedly: \"But he has got her. It is done. And he\r\nwill keep her and hide her as long as we do not yield. So, to avoid\r\n\r\nscandal, we must give in at once.\"\r\n\r\nHis wife, torn by pangs she could not acknowledge, repeated: \"No, no, I\r\nwill never consent.\"\r\n\r\nHe said, growing impatient: \"But there is no disputing about it. It must\r\nbe done. Ah, the rascal, how he has done us! He is a sharp one. All the\r\nsame, we might have made a far better choice as regards position, but\r\nnot as regards intelligence and prospects. He will be a deputy and a\r\nminister.\"\r\n\r\nMadame Walter declared, with savage energy: \"I will never allow him to\r\nmarry Susan. You understand--never.\"\r\n\r\nHe ended by getting angry and taking up, as a practical man, the cudgels\r\non behalf of Pretty-boy. \"Hold your tongue,\" said he. \"I tell you again\r\nthat it must be so; it absolutely must. And who knows? Perhaps we shall\r\nnot regret it. With men of that stamp one never knows what may happen.\r\nYou saw how he overthrew in three articles that fool of a\r\nLaroche-Mathieu, and how he did it with dignity, which was infernally\r\ndifficult in his position as the husband. At all events, we shall see.\r\nIt always comes to this, that we are nailed. We cannot get out of it.\"\r\n\r\nShe felt a longing to scream, to roll on the ground, to tear her hair\r\nout. She said at length, in exasperated tones: \"He shall not have her. I\r\nwon't have it.\"\r\n\r\nWalter rose, picked up his lamp, and remarked: \"There, you are stupid,\r\njust like all women. You never do anything except from passion. You do\r\nnot know how to bend yourself to circumstances. You are stupid. I will\r\ntell you that he shall marry her. It must be.\"\r\n\r\nHe went out, shuffling along in his slippers. He traversed--a comical\r\nphantom in his nightshirt--the broad corridor of the huge slumbering\r\nhouse, and noiselessly re-entered his room.\r\n\r\nMadame Walter remained standing, torn by intolerable grief. She did not\r\nyet quite understand it. She was only conscious of suffering. Then it\r\nseemed to her that she could not remain there motionless till daylight.\r\nShe felt within her a violent necessity of fleeing, of running away, of\r\nseeking help, of being succored. She sought whom she could summon to\r\nher. What man? She could not find one. A priest; yes, a priest! She\r\nwould throw herself at his feet, acknowledge everything, confess her\r\nfault and her despair. He would understand that this wretch must not\r\n\r\nmarry Susan, and would prevent it. She must have a priest at once. But\r\nwhere could she find one? Whither could she go? Yet she could not remain\r\nlike that.\r\n\r\nThen there passed before her eyes, like a vision, the calm figure of\r\nJesus walking on the waters. She saw it as she saw it in the picture. So\r\nhe was calling her. He was saying: \"Come to me; come and kneel at my\r\nfeet. I will console you, and inspire you with what should be done.\"\r\n\r\nShe took her candle, left the room, and went downstairs to the\r\nconservatory. The picture of Jesus was right at the end of it in a small\r\ndrawing-room, shut off by a glass door, in order that the dampness of\r\nthe soil should not damage the canvas. It formed a kind of chapel in a\r\nforest of strange trees. When Madame Walter entered the winter garden,\r\nnever having seen it before save full of light, she was struck by its\r\nobscure profundity. The dense plants of the tropics made the atmosphere\r\nthick with their heavy breath; and the doors no longer being open, the\r\nair of this strange wood, enclosed beneath a glass roof, entered the\r\nchest with difficulty; intoxicated, caused pleasure and pain, and\r\nimparted a confused sensation of enervation, pleasure, and death. The\r\npoor woman walked slowly, oppressed by the shadows, amidst which\r\nappeared, by the flickering light of her candle, extravagant plants,\r\nrecalling monsters, living creatures, hideous deformities. All at once\r\nshe caught sight of the picture of Christ. She opened the door\r\nseparating her from it, and fell on her knees. She prayed to him,\r\nwildly, at first, stammering forth words of true, passionate, and\r\ndespairing invocations. Then, the ardor of her appeal slackening, she\r\nraised her eyes towards him, and was struck with anguish. He resembled\r\nPretty-boy so strongly, in the trembling light of this solitary candle,\r\nlighting the picture from below, that it was no longer Christ--it was\r\nher lover who was looking at her. They were his eyes, his forehead, the\r\nexpression of his face, his cold and haughty air.\r\n\r\nShe stammered: \"Jesus, Jesus, Jesus!\" and the name \"George\" rose to her\r\nlips. All at once she thought that at that very moment, perhaps, George\r\nhad her daughter. He was alone with her somewhere. He with Susan! She\r\nrepeated: \"Jesus, Jesus!\" but she was thinking of them--her daughter and\r\nher lover. They were alone in a room, and at night. She saw them. She\r\nsaw them so plainly that they rose up before her in place of the\r\npicture. They were smiling at one another. They were embracing. She rose\r\nto go towards them, to take her daughter by the hair and tear her from\r\nhis clasp. She would seize her by the throat and strangle her, this\r\ndaughter whom she hated--this daughter who was joining herself to this\r\nman. She touched her; her hands encountered the canvas; she was pressing\r\nthe feet of Christ. She uttered a loud cry and fell on her back. Her\r\ncandle, overturned, went out.\r\n\r\nWhat took place then? She dreamed for a long time wild, frightful\r\ndreams. George and Susan continually passed before her eyes, with Christ\r\nblessing their horrible loves. She felt vaguely that she was not in her\r\nroom. She wished to rise and flee; she could not. A torpor had seized\r\nupon her, which fettered her limbs, and only left her mind on the alert,\r\ntortured by frightful and fantastic visions, lost in an unhealthy\r\ndream--the strange and sometimes fatal dream engendered in human minds\r\nby the soporific plants of the tropics, with their strange and\r\noppressive perfumes.\r\n\r\nThe next morning Madame Walter was found stretched out senseless, almost\r\nasphyxiated before \"Jesus Walking on the Waters.\" She was so ill that\r\nher life was feared for. She only fully recovered the use of her senses\r\nthe following day. Then she began to weep. The disappearance of Susan\r\nwas explained to the servants as due to her being suddenly sent back to\r\nthe convent. And Monsieur Walter replied to a long letter of Du Roy by\r\ngranting him his daughter's hand.\r\n\r\nPretty-boy had posted this letter at the moment of leaving Paris, for he\r\nhad prepared it in advance the evening of his departure. He said in it,\r\nin respectful terms, that he had long loved the young girl; that there\r\nhad never been any agreement between them; but that finding her come\r\nfreely to him to say, \"I wish to be your wife,\" he considered himself\r\nauthorized in keeping her, even in hiding her, until he had obtained an\r\nanswer from her parents, whose legal power had for him less weight than\r\nthe wish of his betrothed. He demanded that Monsieur Walter should\r\nreply, \"post restante,\" a friend being charged to forward the letter to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nWhen he had obtained what he wished he brought back Susan to Paris, and\r\nsent her on to her parents, abstaining himself from appearing for some\r\nlittle time.\r\n\r\nThey had spent six days on the banks of the Seine at La Roche-Guyon.\r\n\r\nThe young girl had never enjoyed herself so much. She had played at\r\npastoral life. As he passed her off as his sister, they lived in a free\r\nand chaste intimacy--a kind of loving friendship. He thought it a clever\r\nstroke to respect her. On the day after their arrival she had purchased\r\nsome linen and some country-girl's clothes, and set to work fishing,\r\nwith a huge straw hat, ornamented with wild flowers, on her head. She\r\nthought the country there delightful. There was an old tower and an old\r\nchateau, in which beautiful tapestry was shown.\r\n\r\nGeorge, dressed in a boating jersey, bought ready-made from a local\r\ntradesman, escorted Susan, now on foot along the banks of the river, now\r\nin a boat. They kissed at every moment, she in all innocence, and he\r\nready to succumb to temptation. But he was able to restrain himself; and\r\nwhen he said to her, \"We will go back to Paris to-morrow; your father\r\nhas granted me your hand,\" she murmured simply, \"Already? It was so nice\r\nbeing your wife here.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was dark in the little suite of rooms in the Rue de Constantinople;\r\nfor George Du Roy and Clotilde de Marelle, having met at the door, had\r\ngone in at once, and she had said to him, without giving him time to\r\nopen the Venetian blinds: \"So you are going to marry Susan Walter?\"\r\n\r\nHe admitted it quietly, and added: \"Did not you know it?\"\r\n\r\nShe exclaimed, standing before him, furious and indignant:\r\n\r\n\"You are going to marry Susan Walter? That is too much of a good thing.\r\nFor three months you have been humbugging in order to hide that from me.\r\nEveryone knew it but me. It was my husband who told me of it.\"\r\n\r\nDu Roy began to laugh, though somewhat confused all the same; and having\r\nplaced his hat on a corner of the mantel-shelf, sat down in an armchair.\r\nShe looked at him straight in the face, and said, in a low and irritated\r\ntone: \"Ever since you left your wife you have been preparing this move,\r\nand you only kept me on as a mistress to fill up the interim nicely.\r\nWhat a rascal you are!\"\r\n\r\nHe asked: \"Why so? I had a wife who deceived me. I caught her, I\r\nobtained a divorce, and I am going to marry another. What could be\r\nsimpler?\"\r\n\r\nShe murmured, quivering: \"Oh! how cunning and dangerous you are.\"\r\n\r\nHe began to smile again. \"By Jove! Simpletons and fools are always\r\nsomeone's dupes.\"\r\n\r\nBut she continued to follow out her idea: \"I ought to have divined your\r\nnature from the beginning. But no, I could not believe that you could be\r\nsuch a blackguard as that.\"\r\n\r\nHe assumed an air of dignity, saying: \"I beg of you to pay attention to\r\nthe words you are making use of.\"\r\n\r\nHis indignation revolted her. \"What? You want me to put on gloves to\r\ntalk to you now. You have behaved towards me like a vagabond ever since\r\nI have known you, and you want to make out that I am not to tell you so.\r\nYou deceive everyone; you take advantage of everyone; you filch money\r\nand enjoyment wherever you can, and you want me to treat you as an\r\nhonest man!\"\r\n\r\nHe rose, and with quivering lip, said: \"Be quiet, or I will turn you out\r\nof here.\"\r\n\r\nShe stammered: \"Turn me out of here; turn me out of here! You will turn\r\nme out of here--you--you?\" She could not speak for a moment for choking\r\nwith anger, and then suddenly, as though the door of her wrath had been\r\n\r\nburst open, she broke out with: \"Turn me out of here? You forget, then,\r\nthat it is I who have paid for these rooms from the beginning. Ah, yes,\r\nyou have certainly taken them on from time to time. But who first took\r\nthem? I did. Who kept them on? I did. And you want to turn me out of\r\nhere. Hold your tongue, you good-for-nothing fellow. Do you think I\r\ndon't know you robbed Madeleine of half Vaudrec's money? Do you think I\r\ndon't know how you slept with Susan to oblige her to marry you?\"\r\n\r\nHe seized her by the shoulders, and, shaking her with both hands,\r\nexclaimed: \"Don't speak of her, at any rate. I won't have it.\"\r\n\r\nShe screamed out: \"You slept with her; I know you did.\"\r\n\r\nHe would have accepted no matter what, but this falsehood exasperated\r\nhim. The truths she had told him to his face had caused thrills of anger\r\nto run through him, but this lie respecting the young girl who was going\r\nto be his wife, awakened in the palm of his hand a furious longing to\r\nstrike her.\r\n\r\nHe repeated: \"Be quiet--have a care--be quiet,\" and shook her as we\r\nshake a branch to make the fruit fall.\r\n\r\nShe yelled, with her hair coming down, her mouth wide open, her eyes\r\naglow: \"You slept with her!\"\r\n\r\nHe let her go, and gave her such a smack on the face that she fell down\r\nbeside the wall. But she turned towards him, and raising herself on her\r\nhands, once more shouted: \"You slept with her!\"\r\n\r\nHe rushed at her, and, holding her down, struck her as though striking a\r\nman. She left off shouting, and began to moan beneath his blows. She no\r\nlonger stirred, but hid her face against the bottom of the wall and\r\nuttered plaintive cries. He left off beating her and rose up. Then he\r\nwalked about the room a little to recover his coolness, and, an idea\r\noccurring to him, went into the bedroom, filled the basin with cold\r\nwater, and dipped his head into it. Then he washed his hands and came\r\nback to see what she was doing, carefully wiping his fingers. She had\r\nnot budged. She was still lying on the ground quietly weeping.\r\n\r\n\"Shall you have done grizzling soon?\"\r\n\r\nShe did not answer. He stood in the middle of the room, feeling somewhat\r\nawkward and ashamed in the presence of the form stretched out before\r\nhim. All at once he formed a resolution, and took his hat from the\r\nmantel-shelf, saying: \"Good-night. Give the key to the doorkeeper when\r\nyou leave. I shan't wait for your convenience.\"\r\n\r\nHe went out, closed the door, went to the doorkeeper's, and said:\r\n\"Madame is still there. She will be leaving in a few minutes. Tell the\r\nlandlord that I give notice to leave at the end of September. It is the\r\n15th of August, so I am within the limits.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he walked hastily away, for he had some pressing calls to make\r\ntouching the purchase of the last wedding gifts.\r\n\r\nThe wedding was fixed for the 20th of October after the meeting of the\r\nChambers. It was to take place at the Church of the Madeleine. There had\r\nbeen a great deal of gossip about it without anyone knowing the exact\r\ntruth. Different tales were in circulation. It was whispered that an\r\nelopement had taken place, but no one was certain about anything.\r\nAccording to the servants, Madame Walter, who would no longer speak to\r\nher future son-in-law, had poisoned herself out of rage the very evening\r\nthe match was decided on, after having taken her daughter off to a\r\nconvent at midnight. She had been brought back almost dead. Certainly,\r\nshe would never get over it. She had now the appearance of an old woman;\r\nher hair had become quite gray, and she had gone in for religion, taking\r\nthe Sacrament every Sunday.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of September the _Vie Francaise_ announced that the\r\nBaron Du Roy de Cantel had become chief editor, Monsieur Walter\r\nretaining the title of manager. A battalion of well-known writers,\r\nreporters, political editors, art and theatrical critics, detached from\r\nold important papers by dint of monetary influence, were taken on. The\r\nold journalists, the serious and respectable ones, no longer shrugged\r\ntheir shoulders when speaking of the _Vie Francaise_. Rapid and complete\r\nsuccess had wiped out the contempt of serious writers for the beginnings\r\nof this paper.\r\n\r\nThe marriage of its chief editor was what is styled a Parisian event,\r\nGeorge Du Roy and the Walters having excited a great deal of curiosity\r\nfor some time past. All the people who are written about in the papers\r\npromised themselves to be there.\r\n\r\nThe event took place on a bright autumn day.\r\n\r\nAt eight in the morning the sight of the staff of the Madeleine\r\nstretching a broad red carpet down the lofty flight of steps overlooking\r\nthe Rue Royale caused passers-by to pause, and announced to the people\r\nof Paris that an important ceremony was about to take place. The clerks\r\non the way to their offices, the work-girls, the shopmen, paused,\r\nlooked, and vaguely speculated about the rich folk who spent so much\r\nmoney over getting spliced. Towards ten o'clock idlers began to halt.\r\nThey would remain for a few minutes, hoping that perhaps it would begin\r\nat once, and then moved away. At eleven squads of police arrived and set\r\nto work almost at once to make the crowd move on, groups forming every\r\nmoment. The first guests soon made their appearance--those who wanted to\r\nbe well placed for seeing everything. They took the chairs bordering the\r\nmain aisles. By degrees came others, ladies in rustling silks, and\r\nserious-looking gentlemen, almost all bald, walking with well-bred air,\r\nand graver than usual in this locality.\r\n\r\nThe church slowly filled. A flood of sunlight entered by the huge\r\ndoorway lit up the front row of guests. In the choir, which looked\r\nsomewhat gloomy, the altar, laden with tapers, shed a yellow light, pale\r\nand humble in face of that of the main entrance. People recognized one\r\nanother, beckoned to one another, and gathered in groups. The men of\r\nletters, less respectful than the men in society, chatted in low tones\r\nand looked at the ladies.\r\n\r\nNorbert de Varenne, who was looking out for an acquaintance, perceived\r\nJacques Rival near the center of the rows of chair, and joined him.\r\n\"Well,\" said he, \"the race is for the cunning.\"\r\n\r\nThe other, who was not envious, replied: \"So much the better for him.\r\nHis career is safe.\" And they began to point out the people they\r\nrecognized.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know what became of his wife?\" asked Rival.\r\n\r\nThe poet smiled. \"Yes, and no. She is living in a very retired style, I\r\nam told, in the Montmartre district. But--there is a but--I have noticed\r\nfor some time past in the _Plume_ some political articles terribly like\r\nthose of Forestier and Du Roy. They are by Jean Le Dal, a handsome,\r\nintelligent young fellow, of the same breed as our friend George, and\r\nwho has made the acquaintance of his late wife. From whence I conclude\r\nthat she had, and always will have, a fancy for beginners. She is,\r\nbesides, rich. Vaudrec and Laroche-Mathieu were not assiduous visitors\r\nat the house for nothing.\"\r\n\r\nRival observed: \"She is not bad looking, Madeleine. Very clever and very\r\nsharp. She must be charming on terms of intimacy. But, tell me, how is\r\nit that Du Roy comes to be married in church after a divorce?\"\r\n\r\nNorbert replied: \"He is married in church because, in the eyes of the\r\nChurch, he was not married before.\"\r\n\r\n\"How so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Our friend, Pretty-boy, from indifference or economy, thought the\r\nregistrar sufficient when marrying Madeleine Forestier. He therefore\r\ndispensed with the ecclesiastical benediction, which constituted in the\r\neyes of Holy Mother Church a simple state of concubinage. Consequently\r\nhe comes before her to-day as a bachelor, and she lends him all her pomp\r\nand ceremony, which will cost Daddy Walter a pretty penny.\"\r\n\r\nThe murmur of the augmented throng swelled beneath the vaulted room.\r\nVoices could be heard speaking almost out loud. People pointed out to\r\none another celebrities who attitudinized, pleased to be seen, and\r\ncarefully maintained the bearing adopted by them towards the public\r\naccustomed to exhibit themselves thus at all such gatherings, of which\r\nthey were, it seemed to them, the indispensable ornaments.\r\n\r\nRival resumed: \"Tell me, my dear fellow, you who go so often to the\r\ngovernor's, is it true that Du Roy and Madame Walter no longer speak to\r\none another?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never. She did not want to give him the girl. But he had a hold, it\r\nseems, on the father through skeletons in the house--skeletons connected\r\nwith the Morocco business. He threatened the old man with frightful\r\nrevelations. Walter recollected the example he made of Laroche-Mathieu,\r\nand gave in at once. But the mother, obstinate like all women, swore\r\nthat she would never again speak a word to her son-in-law. She looks\r\nlike a statue, a statue of Vengeance, and he is very uneasy at it,\r\nalthough he puts a good face on the matter, for he knows how to control\r\nhimself, that fellow does.\"\r\n\r\nFellow-journalists came up and shook hands with them. Bits of political\r\nconversation could be caught. Vague as the sound of a distant sea, the\r\nnoise of the crowd massed in front of the church entered the doorway\r\nwith the sunlight, and rose up beneath the roof, above the more discreet\r\nmurmur of the choicer public gathered within it.\r\n\r\nAll at once the beadle struck the pavement thrice with the butt of his\r\nhalberd. Every one turned round with a prolonged rustling of skirts and\r\na moving of chairs. The bride appeared on her father's arm in the\r\nbright light of the doorway.\r\n\r\nShe had still the air of a doll, a charming white doll crowned with\r\norange flowers. She stood for a few moments on the threshold, then, when\r\nshe made her first step up the aisle, the organ gave forth a powerful\r\nnote, announcing the entrance of the bride in loud metallic tones. She\r\nadvanced with bent head, but not timidly; vaguely moved, pretty,\r\ncharming, a miniature bride. The women smiled and murmured as they\r\nwatched her pass. The men muttered: \"Exquisite! Adorable!\" Monsieur\r\nWalter walked with exaggerated dignity, somewhat pale, and with his\r\nspectacles straight on his nose. Behind them four bridesmaids, all four\r\ndressed in pink, and all four pretty, formed the court of this gem of a\r\nqueen. The groomsmen, carefully chosen to match, stepped as though\r\ntrained by a ballet master. Madame Walter followed them, giving her arm\r\nto the father of her other son-in-law, the Marquis de Latour-Yvelin,\r\naged seventy-two. She did not walk, she dragged herself along, ready to\r\nfaint at each forward movement. It could be felt that her feet stuck to\r\nthe flagstones, that her legs refused to advance, and that her heart was\r\nbeating within her breast like an animal bounding to escape. She had\r\ngrown thin. Her white hair made her face appear still more blanched and\r\nher cheeks hollower. She looked straight before her in order not to see\r\nany one--in order not to recall, perhaps, that which was torturing her.\r\n\r\nThen George Du Roy appeared with an old lady unknown. He, too, kept his\r\nhead up without turning aside his eyes, fixed and stern under his\r\nslightly bent brows. His moustache seemed to bristle on his lip. He was\r\nset down as a very good-looking fellow. He had a proud bearing, a good\r\nfigure, and a straight leg. He wore his clothes well, the little red\r\nribbon of the Legion of Honor showing like a drop of blood on his dress\r\ncoat.\r\n\r\nThen came the relations, Rose with the Senator Rissolin. She had been\r\nmarried six weeks. The Count de Latour-Yvelin accompanied by the\r\nViscountess de Percemur. Finally, there was a strange procession of the\r\nfriends and allies of Du Roy, whom he introduced to his new family;\r\npeople known in the Parisian world, who became at once the intimates,\r\nand, if need be, the distant cousins of rich parvenus; gentlemen ruined,\r\nblemished; married, in some cases, which is worse. There were Monsieur\r\nde Belvigne, the Marquis de Banjolin, the Count and Countess de Ravenel,\r\nPrince Kravalow, the Chevalier, Valreali; then some guests of Walter's,\r\nthe Prince de Guerche, the Duke and the Duchess de Ferracine, the\r\nbeautiful Marchioness des Dunes. Some of Madame Walter's relatives\r\npreserved a well-to-do, countrified appearance amidst the throng.\r\n\r\nThe organ was still playing, pouring forth through the immense building\r\nthe sonorous and rhythmic accents of its glittering throats, which cry\r\naloud unto heaven the joy or grief of mankind. The great doors were\r\nclosed, and all at once it became as gloomy as if the sun had just been\r\nturned out.\r\n\r\nNow, George was kneeling beside his wife in the choir, before the lit-up\r\naltar. The new Bishop of Tangiers, crozier in hand and miter on head,\r\nmade his appearance from the vestry to join them together in the Eternal\r\nname. He put the customary questions, exchanged the rings, uttered the\r\nwords that bind like chains, and addressed the newly-wedded couple a\r\nChristian allocution. He was a tall, stout man, one of those handsome\r\nprelates to whom a rounded belly lends dignity.\r\n\r\nThe sound of sobs caused several people to look round. Madame Walter was\r\nweeping, with her face buried in her hands. She had to give way. What\r\ncould she have done else? But since the day when she had driven from her\r\nroom her daughter on her return home, refusing to embrace her; since the\r\nday when she had said, in a low voice, to Du Roy, who had greeted her\r\nceremoniously on again making his appearance: \"You are the vilest\r\ncreature I know of; never speak to me again, for I shall not answer\r\nyou,\" she had been suffering intolerable and unappeasable tortures. She\r\nhated Susan with a keen hatred, made up of exasperated passion and\r\nheartrending jealousy, the strange jealousy of a mother and\r\nmistress--unacknowledgable, ferocious, burning like a new wound. And now\r\na bishop was marrying them--her lover and her daughter--in a church, in\r\npresence of two thousand people, and before her. And she could say\r\nnothing. She could not hinder it. She could not cry out: \"But that man\r\nbelongs to me; he is my lover. This union you are blessing is infamous!\"\r\n\r\nSome ladies, touched at the sight, murmured: \"How deeply the poor mother\r\nfeels it!\"\r\n\r\nThe bishop was declaiming: \"You are among the fortunate ones of this\r\nworld, among the wealthiest and most respected. You, sir, whom your\r\ntalent raises above others; you who write, who teach, who advise, who\r\nguide the people, you who have a noble mission to fulfill, a noble\r\nexample to set.\"\r\n\r\nDu Roy listened, intoxicated with pride. A prelate of the Roman Catholic\r\nChurch was speaking thus to him. And he felt behind him a crowd, an\r\nillustrious crowd, gathered on his account. It seemed to him that some\r\npower impelled and lifted him up. He was becoming one of the masters of\r\nthe world--he, the son of two poor peasants at Canteleu. He saw them all\r\nat once in their humble wayside inn, at the summit of the slope\r\noverlooking the broad valley of Rouen, his father and mother, serving\r\nthe country-folk of the district with drink, He had sent them five\r\nthousand francs on inheriting from the Count de Vaudrec. He would now\r\nsend them fifty thousand, and they would buy a little estate. They would\r\nbe satisfied and happy.\r\n\r\nThe bishop had finished his harangue. A priest, clad in a golden stole,\r\nascended the steps of the altar, and the organ began anew to celebrate\r\nthe glory of the newly-wedded couple. Now it gave forth long, loud\r\nnotes, swelling like waves, so sonorous and powerful that it seemed as\r\nthough they must lift and break through the roof to spend abroad into\r\nthe sky. Their vibrating sound filled the church, causing body and\r\nspirit to thrill. Then all at once they grew calmer, and delicate notes\r\nfloated through the air, little graceful, twittering notes, fluttering\r\nlike birds; and suddenly again this coquettish music waxed once more, in\r\nturn becoming terrible in its strength and fullness, as if a grain of\r\nsand had transformed itself into a world. Then human voices rose, and\r\nwere wafted over the bowed heads--Vauri and Landeck, of the Opera, were\r\nsinging. The incense shed abroad a delicate odor, and the Divine\r\nSacrifice was accomplished on the altar, to consecrate the triumph of\r\nthe Baron George Du Roy!\r\n\r\nPretty-boy, on his knees beside Susan, had bowed his head. He felt at\r\nthat moment almost a believer, almost religious; full of gratitude\r\ntowards the divinity who had thus favored him, who treated him with such\r\nconsideration. And without exactly knowing to whom he was addressing\r\nhimself, he thanked him for his success.\r\n\r\nWhen the ceremony was concluded he rose up, and giving his wife his arm,\r\nhe passed into the vestry. Then began the interminable defiling past of\r\nthe visitors. George, with wild joy, believed himself a king whom a\r\nnation had come to acclaim. He shook hands, stammered unmeaning remarks,\r\nbowed, and replied: \"You are very good to say so.\"\r\n\r\nAll at once he caught sight of Madame de Marelle, and the recollection\r\nof all the kisses that he had given her, and that she had returned; the\r\nrecollection of all their caresses, of her pretty ways, of the sound of\r\nher voice, of the taste of her lips, caused the desire to have her once\r\nmore for his own to shoot through his veins. She was so pretty and\r\nelegant, with her boyish air and bright eyes. George thought to himself:\r\n\"What a charming mistress, all the same.\"\r\n\r\nShe drew near, somewhat timid, somewhat uneasy, and held out her hand.\r\nHe took it in his, and retained it. Then he felt the discreet appeal of\r\na woman's fingers, the soft pressure that forgives and takes possession\r\nagain. And for his own part, he squeezed it, that little hand, as though\r\nto say: \"I still love you; I am yours.\"\r\n\r\nTheir eyes met, smiling, bright, full of love. She murmured in her\r\npleasant voice: \"I hope to have the pleasure of seeing you again soon,\r\nsir.\"\r\n\r\nHe replied, gayly: \"Soon, madame.\"\r\n\r\nShe passed on. Other people were pushing forward. The crowd flowed by\r\nlike a stream. At length it grew thinner. The last guests took leave.\r\n\r\nGeorge took Susan's arm in his to pass through the church again. It was\r\nfull of people, for everyone had regained their seats in order to see\r\nthem pass together. They went by slowly, with calm steps and uplifted\r\nheads, their eyes fixed on the wide sunlit space of the open door. He\r\nfelt little quiverings run all over his skin those cold shivers caused\r\nby over-powering happiness. He saw no one. His thoughts were solely for\r\nhimself. When he gained the threshold he saw the crowd collected--a\r\ndense, agitated crowd, gathered there on his account--on account of\r\nGeorge Du Roy. The people of Paris were gazing at and envying him. Then,\r\nraising his eyes, he could see afar off, beyond the Palace de la\r\nConcorde, the Chamber of Deputies, and it seemed to him that he was\r\ngoing to make but one jump from the portico of the Madeleine to that of\r\nthe Palais Bourbon.\r\n\r\nHe slowly descended the long flight of steps between two ranks of\r\nspectators. But he did not see them; his thoughts had now flown\r\nbackwards, and before his eyes, dazzled by the brilliant sun, now\r\nfloated the image of Madame de Marelle, re-adjusting before the glass\r\nthe little curls on her temples, always disarranged when she rose.",
